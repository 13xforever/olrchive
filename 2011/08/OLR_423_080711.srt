00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,040
Tonight, August 7th, 2011, the Vita gets bumped to 2012, the Humble Indie bundle adds even

2
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:29,760
more games, and can you soon make a living playing Diablo 3?

3
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,520
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

4
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:39,160
where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:42,960
My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-hosts.

6
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,640
First off, the one, the only, Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

7
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,640
Hi.

8
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,640
How are you, Jamie?

9
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,280
I'm a culinary fucking goddess.

10
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,920
Congratulations.

11
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,820
What makes you a culinary fucking goddess?

12
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,320
Because I'm sharing one of my favorite recipes with you guys today.

13
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,320
What would that recipe be?

14
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,320
Monkeys' brains?

15
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,960
No.

16
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:04,560
While, you know, famous in Cantonese cuisine is rarely seen in the United States, no.

17
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,560
Touche.

18
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,440
Or in Washington, D.C., I should say.

19
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:13,160
No, they are blue potatoes, baked instead of fried, but baked with garlic, majorum,

20
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:17,320
oregano, Himalayan salt, pepper, and lots of-

21
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,320
Himalayan salt?

22
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,280
I asked for Mongolian salt, god damn it.

23
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,680
Lots of garlic, and plenty of Italian cheeses.

24
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,160
Oh, well, garlic salt always.

25
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,160
So eat some.

26
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,440
Okay, I will, I will, but I've got to set up the show first.

27
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,440
Okay.

28
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,440
All right.

29
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:35,880
Say hello as well to less of a culinary goddess, but still pretty awesome, tech master, Loki.

30
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,880
How's it going?

31
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:37,880
I'm good.

32
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,200
How are you, Loki?

33
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,200
Pretty good.

34
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,200
Yeah?

35
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,200
What's new with you?

36
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,200
Not much.

37
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,200
Has there been any culinary works in your life?

38
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,440
I know you used to do, you used to deep fry everything in good times.

39
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:54,400
Yeah, I haven't really done any deep frying in a while.

40
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,400
Well, that's too bad.

41
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,680
All right.

42
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,680
Well, let's start talking about games with you guys in our chatroom at chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

43
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,600
If you've never joined us for a live show, you should sometime.

44
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,840
Sunday nights, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf

45
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:13,560
show at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.

46
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,680
And yep, we have our chatters there.

47
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,120
Let's see, Tigerclaw says, Rob, did you just say monkeys?

48
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,160
Then you must have seen the new Planet of the Apes.

49
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,200
Nope, didn't see the new Planet of the Apes.

50
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,760
I heard it was number one in the box office, so it did way better than everyone thought

51
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,760
it would.

52
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,760
And they threw lots of number two.

53
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,280
I used to hate those movies, actually, growing up.

54
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,000
Like, I think my dad or my brother or somebody really liked those movies, and I always thought

55
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,080
they were terrible.

56
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,520
Like the Charlton Heston, I really don't like Charlton Heston.

57
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:43,920
Like, it has nothing to do with the politics side or the gun, my cold, dead hands on stuff.

58
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,440
Just, I just, God, I don't know.

59
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,960
Like something about him in movies just irritates me.

60
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,960
I don't know.

61
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,720
I'm sure there's a lot of people that would disagree, and that's fine.

62
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,000
Sometimes we disagree on this show.

63
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,720
But let's talk less about movies and talk about games.

64
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,760
We'll start off with Dark Soccer.

65
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,200
How was your gaming week?

66
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,480
Um, freaking Tiny Tower.

67
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,840
I blame you.

68
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,160
I'm up to floor 11 now.

69
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,440
It's actually kind of fun in a...

70
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,760
They talked about Mario twice.

71
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,880
I think Nintendo has a hidden agenda in that game.

72
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,880
How so?

73
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:18,240
Well, there's been two Mario references.

74
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,440
There's also, I saw Bobby posted on Twitter.

75
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:24,920
There's a Bad Dudes reference in there somewhere.

76
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:28,400
Like a bad enough dude to take on, or to save the president or whatever.

77
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,160
Was that line from the original Bad Dudes game?

78
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,160
Yeah.

79
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,400
It's pretty funny though.

80
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,960
And um, I actually didn't play any Groove Coaster.

81
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,960
That's too bad.

82
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,960
It's fine.

83
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,960
I played a lot of WoW.

84
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:43,800
Mostly because I've been forever alone.

85
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,800
My husband's gone.

86
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,400
He'll be back next week though.

87
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,560
You've been neglecting your consoles.

88
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,560
A little bit.

89
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,000
I actually was gonna go in and play the Saturn and I was like, I gotta do what to hook it

90
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
up?

91
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Nevermind.

92
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Alright.

93
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,920
There's actually an email that I was reading in the emails that I'll have to get to later

94
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,480
on that kind of asks you about playing the old games in the vault.

95
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,480
Yep.

96
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,480
Curious to hear about that later.

97
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,480
But we'll get to that in part B.

98
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,400
Alright, well Loki, how was your gaming week?

99
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,520
Um, it was okay.

100
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,000
I played lots of Groove Coaster.

101
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,520
That game's pretty fun.

102
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:20,840
It almost seems like it should be like a Q games game, but here it's not.

103
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:24,480
More Grand Theft Auto and more Earth Defense Force.

104
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:29,840
Actually, a lot of Earth Defense Force this week, which is kind of cool.

105
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,800
Leveling up my tactical guy.

106
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:39,520
We finished going through, well I had already gone through all the, was it like normal mode

107
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:45,980
or whatever, and my coworker hadn't though, so we played through that again, and now we're

108
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:48,760
starting hard again.

109
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:54,600
So I'll level up my tactical guy a little bit more, I think he's level 5 right now.

110
00:04:54,600 --> 00:05:00,000
Do want to start leveling up some other characters, but haven't had time.

111
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
So that's pretty much it.

112
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,600
Oh, and now of course the tiny tower, because I have to join the cult that is the tiny tower.

113
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,600
Are you in Game Center?

114
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,600
No, you don't use that.

115
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,600
Yeah, I use that.

116
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,600
You don't have to have me on there.

117
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,560
Oh no, I do have you on there.

118
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,800
You are the only person that's on my Game Center.

119
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:18,200
I don't see your tower yet because you didn't start playing until like today, so I got it.

120
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,200
Yes.

121
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,400
Alright, my gaming week.

122
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,600
I picked up the Humble Indie Bundle, which I know is going to come up in the show later,

123
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,120
so I'll talk more about the bundle itself when it comes up in the news later.

124
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,360
But one of the games in the Humble Indie Bundle has been taking up a lot of my time, and that's

125
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,360
because I think it's terrific.

126
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:36,940
It's a terrific game, and it's one of those games, it's been brought up on the show before,

127
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:40,440
and I distinctly remember somebody had called in at the end of the year last year to say

128
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:44,240
that this was their favorite game of the year, and I was like, oh, I'll have to check that

129
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,560
out at some point, you know, and amongst all the other games I tried to fit in in a day,

130
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,760
I just never got around to it until now.

131
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:55,560
But now that I play this game, it's just like taking up all my time that I'm not playing

132
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:13,640
like WoW or an MMO or something, and that's VVVVVVVV.

133
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:17,520
I mean, this game could have been on the Commodore 64, that's obviously kind of the style they're

134
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:24,660
going for, but the music adds so much to it.

135
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,700
because the music is amazing in the game.

136
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:27,920
It's all chiptune type stuff.

137
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,480
If you like the Scott Pilgrim soundtrack, Super Meat Boy,

138
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,540
that type of stuff, you'll love the soundtrack to this.

139
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:35,560
And obviously it takes a lot of influences

140
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,020
from more recent gaming.

141
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:39,380
I think if you like Super Meat Boy,

142
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,760
this type of game's right up your alley

143
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:45,120
because it's about dying over and over and over again

144
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,040
on a level until you get it just right.

145
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,640
But then there's that whole exploration

146
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:52,600
and open world sense of the game

147
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,560
that you can kind of go rescue your friends in any order.

148
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,440
That's kind of where VVVVV gets its name

149
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,520
is it's you and all the friends that get lost on the,

150
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,700
you know, the spaceship blows up

151
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,260
and pieces are all over the planet

152
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,400
and all your friends are lost

153
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,960
and you gotta go around and kind of find them

154
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,320
and rescue them.

155
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,280
And some of the areas are really hard.

156
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,080
And each area kind of has its own little like trick.

157
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,260
Like even though the main point of the game

158
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,880
is push button flip gravity,

159
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:19,280
which is much more involved than it would sound.

160
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,160
Like some, like one dungeon

161
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,880
or whatever you want to call it that I was in

162
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,160
had trip wires.

163
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,360
And whenever you hit the trip wire,

164
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,740
the gravity automatically flipped.

165
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,560
And so you really had to kind of like

166
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,360
maneuver your character to hit trip wires

167
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,900
sometimes sequentially to get through the room

168
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,240
without landing on spikes.

169
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,760
Another area I was in was all about

170
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,020
warping from one side of the room to the other.

171
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:40,240
Like the only way to escape a room

172
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,240
would be from one predetermined exit.

173
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,720
Kind of like think of like the infinite maze,

174
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,160
like in a Zelda map.

175
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,280
Remember old school Zelda maps?

176
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,240
You had to go like up, left, down, left

177
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,080
or whatever to get out of the maze.

178
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,440
You had to go up and up and up and up and up.

179
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,000
Kind of like that ish sort of thing.

180
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,040
Like that's where it gets its inspiration clearly.

181
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,240
But yeah.

182
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,240
Like the way you get to the graveyard.

183
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,220
Northwest, what was it?

184
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,200
Northwest, Southwest?

185
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,280
I think it's like up, left, down, left.

186
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,120
Yeah.

187
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:03,940
Yeah.

188
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:06,600
So yeah, I mean, clearly the game

189
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,840
takes its influences from more recent games,

190
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,540
but it's not old style.

191
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:13,120
And so obviously that adds kind of a charm to it

192
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,800
that I guess it all kind of just kind of makes a mood.

193
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,640
I don't know.

194
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,640
I honestly think if the game had just done new graphics,

195
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,240
it would have been horribly overlooked.

196
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:26,840
Like I think sometimes that whole little retro catch

197
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,360
kind of adds a lot to the game.

198
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,280
There's not just by the way,

199
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,420
the open world Metroidy part of the game.

200
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:33,520
There's also like time trial levels that you can play.

201
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:37,600
And you can play made up worlds.

202
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,160
Like there's like a little level packs in it and so forth.

203
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,280
So yeah.

204
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,120
Amazing deal because right now you could get this game

205
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,960
for a dollar if you wanted to.

206
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,820
I think you're kind of cheap if you do,

207
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,360
but I understand some people are broke

208
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,960
and in school and what have you.

209
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,160
It's honestly,

210
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,280
if you miss the Humble Indie Bundle altogether,

211
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,880
it's worth the $10 on Steam.

212
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,720
I think so.

213
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,560
Especially if you like,

214
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,420
like if you like Super Meat Boy and those types of games,

215
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:04,200
retro fan, this game's right up your alley.

216
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,760
I bought it when it was two bucks.

217
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,600
Oh, nice.

218
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,440
During the Steam sales?

219
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,280
Way back.

220
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,100
Way back.

221
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:09,940
I've had it for awhile.

222
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:10,780
Cool.

223
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:11,600
Yeah.

224
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,440
It was really good.

225
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,280
It's a great game.

226
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,100
So yeah, that was taking up a lot of my time this week.

227
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,360
I played some of the other stuff in the bundle.

228
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,640
I played Cogs for a little bit,

229
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,040
which is kind of like a puzzle game.

230
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,360
That's all about,

231
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,240
like, you know, the sliding puzzles, right?

232
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,660
You know, you have these only keychains and stuff.

233
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,520
Yeah. You move, move a piece over.

234
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,240
Okay. Well imagine that now the pieces

235
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,800
have cog wheels on them

236
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,880
and you have like a spinning gear on one side of the board

237
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,120
and then a golden gear on the other side of the board,

238
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,040
or maybe like you're trying to power a propeller.

239
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,360
So it's just like, you have to move,

240
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,360
instead of making a picture,

241
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:43,840
it's like the dual puzzle of line up the wheels, right?

242
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,520
So that way it powers the machine.

243
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:49,560
It's kind of got that whole like steampunk-ish vibe,

244
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,400
but not really, I don't know.

245
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:54,160
It's very, very puzzle-y interface and so forth.

246
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,960
So I, yeah, that was, that was fun.

247
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,040
So those are kind of the big ones I've checked out.

248
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,400
Otherwise, most of the same stuff,

249
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,200
Warcraft, Final Fantasy 13,

250
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,040
randomly played Wipeout this week.

251
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,520
I don't know, just wanted to play F-Zero

252
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,760
and didn't feel like cooking up the GameCube.

253
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,880
So I'm like, oh, let's play Wipeout.

254
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,400
It's about the next best thing.

255
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,820
Yeah. There you go.

256
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,400
That was my gaming week.

257
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:17,040
So let's get into some gaming news.

258
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,400
After I mentioned real quick,

259
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,840

Those are places to follow us online.

263
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,920

Five star reviews on iTunes are much, much, much appreciated

267
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,700
because we don't make anything off the show.

268
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,280
We don't even ask you to pay what you want.

269
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,320
It's just free.

270
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,140
Question for you.

271
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:41,980
Yes.

272
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:42,820
What did you think?

273
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:43,660
Of?

274
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:44,480
The dish.

275
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,320
Oh, what you made?

276
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,640
Am I a culinary goddess or what?

277
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,180
I haven't, well, I've been talking most times,

278
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,200
so I haven't been able to really eat it,

279
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,600
but it's really good.

280
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,440
I like it.

281
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,840
See everybody, I'm awesome.

282
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,520
I don't wanna inflate your ego too much.

283
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,280
You're gonna have to go on Hell's Kitchen or something

284
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,120
and get your ego kicked out of it.

285
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,440
No, because I would punch what's-his-face.

286
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,800
Be like, you're much nicer to the people on MasterChef.

287
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,600
Gordon Ramsay.

288
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,800
All right.

289
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,120
Let's see, going to the chatroom

290
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,920
at chat.orangelandraday.com.

291
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,480
Spazinator PC in chat says,

292
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,080
if there was a sequel to VVVVVVV,

293
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:22,000
would it be called VVVVVVVV2?

294
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,840
No.

295
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,160
VVVV70s or WWW?

296
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:51,920
I think it would probably be a letter repeated.

297
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,560
Ugh, I think I'd rather glue my forehead

298
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,960
to a donkey's ass.

299
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,280
An ass's ass.

300
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,240
It's neater than it sounds.

301
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,480
I don't think this,

302
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,520
it really depends what types of games you're into.

303
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,120
If you like actiony type of games,

304
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,360
you're probably not gonna get so much out of cogs,

305
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,080
but there's some people that just, to kill time,

306
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,080
like to sit there and play a little puzzler.

307
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,720
Like, you know, some of you probably play

308
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,460
Plants vs. Zombies, Bejeweled, those are puzzlers.

309
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:19,040
This is kind of right up that same alley.

310
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,560
All right, there you go.

311
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,620
Chat.orangelandtrady.com if you wanna join us live

312
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:23,460
on this Sunday night.

313
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:24,980
Let's get to some gaming news.

314
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,860
We'll start off with Loki.

315
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:27,700
Ah, yes.

316
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,960
Apparently, the PlayStation Vita

317
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,140
will not be coming out this year.

318
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:33,980
Too bad.

319
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:37,040
At least, not over here in the United States

320
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,720
or North America or in Europe.

321
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,200
Instead, it'll be coming out in early 2012.

322
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,940
Of course, I'm assuming Sony being a Japanese company,

323
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:48,040
the Japanese will get theirs holiday, 2011.

324
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:53,040
But yeah, right now, no real reason given,

325
00:12:55,320 --> 00:13:00,320
other than, you know, I don't know that they're delaying it.

326
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,200
I think it's a good idea,

327
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,760
because if it means either more units being produced

328
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,480
so that they don't have shortages,

329
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:13,480
or to have better games coming out at launch,

330
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,960
I mean, both of those things would definitely help them out.

331
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,120
And of course, they were asked

332
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,700
whether they'd be lowering their price,

333
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:24,280
because Nintendo did it on the 3DS,

334
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:27,900
they lowered their price to compete with the Vita.

335
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:28,740
They basically said,

336
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,880
we packed so much into the device

337
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,680
and made it very affordable,

338
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,000
there's no need to lower the price

339
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,980
just because somebody else happens to be

340
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:38,080
in the video game business

341
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,640
and decided that they were gonna lower their price.

342
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:44,760
And honestly, there is a lot of components in the Vita,

343
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:48,120
but if that shit isn't gonna sell at launch,

344
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,460
they will lower the price.

345
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,500
That's just the way things are.

346
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,120
Something else though, got delayed to early 2012 as well.

347
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,400
That'd be Twisted Metal,

348
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:02,200
which was supposed to be coming out in October,

349
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,800
and now it's early 2012.

350
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,200
They basically said, you know,

351
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,880
late game is only late until it ships.

352
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,680
A bad game is bad until the end of time.

353
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,800
Great quote.

354
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,400
If we shipped Twisted Metal tomorrow,

355
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,680
going off the response from folks who have played it,

356
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,660
I assure you, it would never be a bad game.

357
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,320
But yes, they're spending the extra time polishing the game.

358
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:41,320
I can wait, it'll be awesome.

359
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,360
Yeah, that game has been in development

360
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,180
for quite some time now, hasn't it?

361
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:46,020
Yep.

362
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,420
So let's go back to the Vita being delayed.

363
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:51,280
What does it boil down to, the cost for delay?

364
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:55,200
It's parts, it's strategical, what's going on?

365
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,720
Because you kinda knew about this

366
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,820
before the rest of the internet did, didn't you?

367
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:00,880
Yes.

368
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,700
So what's up?

369
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,680
Nothing really, they didn't say.

370
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,520
They said it's 2012.

371
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,280
Part of me wondered if maybe they saw

372
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,540
what the 3DS was doing wrong.

373
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:16,120
And that was that the 3DS launched

374
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:19,440
without really having any good games at launch.

375
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,040
Debatable, I understand Street Fighter IV has its fans,

376
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,640
but let's face it, that was a port of a game

377
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,320
that had already been out for a couple years, right?

378
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:29,160
And if that's your strongest release title, something's up.

379
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,400
So maybe they were looking at that going,

380
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,880
well, what do we have coming out at launch on the Vita?

381
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,480
You know, if these developers aren't really ready

382
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,720
to put out all-star games, maybe now's not the time

383
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,800
to put out the Vita, because that was where my mind went,

384
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,440
is I said, well, maybe the Uncharted people

385
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,000
weren't ready to put out the game.

386
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,400
And if that's your biggest game

387
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,840
and that's gonna get delayed,

388
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,740
let's just delay the whole damn thing.

389
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,240
Could be.

390
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,080
Let's call the whole thing off.

391
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,280
Apparently, so.

392
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:03,280
All right, well, going to chat.orangelaunchradio.com,

393
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,320
Black Lab is in chat tonight saying,

394
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,200
I can tell Rob started talking mid-chew.

395
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,640
Hey, I gotta eat sometime.

396
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,600
When I got something to say, I'm gonna say it.

397
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,880
Let's see, Brakeman in chat says,

398
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,920
I got a PSP at full price, if only I'd waited.

399
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:21,560
Well, here's a newsflash.

400
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:24,000
You could wait to get a Vita too,

401
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,380
but it's probably gonna take a long time

402
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,760
for the price to drop on that,

403
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,640
especially if it comes out in the first part of next year.

404
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:34,520
There could be a small price drop at the end of next year

405
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:38,920
going into holiday 2012, but that's not for sure.

406
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,200
I'd be interested in the Vita

407
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,760
if they had Saints Row on it, or Grand Theft Auto.

408
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,680
Might just be a matter of time.

409
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,980
Either one of those is very interchangeable,

410
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,640
or Earth Defense Force.

411
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:53,020
Any of those three, I would definitely be down for a Vita,

412
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:56,020
but as of right now, I've seen how much

413
00:16:56,020 --> 00:17:00,800
I play my 3DS, which is not at all.

414
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,520
So I just don't need another system

415
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:06,960
cluttering up my bank account.

416
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,920
All right, well let's talk about the other handheld,

417
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:12,200
the 3DS, oh, before we get to 3DS actually,

418
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,240
let me ask one more question.

419
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,400
Does this change your opinion at all about the Vita?

420
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,020
And I asked this to chat too.

421
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:19,160
Does it change your opinion thus far at the Vita?

422
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:22,160
Does it change the fact whether you want one or not?

423
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,600
For me, I'll start.

424
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,340
No, it doesn't really change my opinion of the Vita.

425
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:28,200
In fact, I actually kinda say, you know what?

426
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,760
If you're not ready, then that's cool.

427
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,640
Take your time till you've got a really solid launch lineup.

428
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,180
And B, the fact that the holidays

429
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,720
are gonna be killer anyway, I'm kinda glad

430
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,480
to not have to spend 250 bucks right now on a Vita as well,

431
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,720
because you know I'll have to have it.

432
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:45,580
So actually, I'm not so bothered by this.

433
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:46,480
What about you guys?

434
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,980
Loki?

435
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:52,360
I was kind of just warm about the Vita to begin with,

436
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:55,760
and nothing really stood out so far with the Vita

437
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,600
that says, I gotta have that system.

438
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,640
So until I see something like that,

439
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,840
then I don't really have to have that system.

440
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:07,240
It depends on finances.

441
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:10,360
I mean, the Vita looks nice, hooray.

442
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,600
But I hardly touch my PSP,

443
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,400
so why would I wanna touch the new one?

444
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,160
I really didn't play the PSP that much

445
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:20,600
except for Popolo Cross and Loco Roco.

446
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,760
There's gonna have to be those must-have games.

447
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:25,160
Yeah, it's really gonna be more of a matter of games.

448
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,040
I mean, even Dissidia wasn't really enough

449
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:30,080
to make me really wanna play my PSP.

450
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,780
But see, I got on board with PSP early

451
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:35,080
because the very first time I played Luminous,

452
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,160
I was like, oh my god, this is the best music puzzle game.

453
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,280
We had a PSP the day they came out.

454
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,240
Yeah, yeah.

455
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,360
And I love Luminous.

456
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:45,840
I remember playing it really drunk on my birthday,

457
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,960
playing Wendell's PSP.

458
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,880
Shining, shining, room is spinning.

459
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,000
Oh, I didn't even care.

460
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,800
There was a bunch of food, and I think I stopped for fire.

461
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,660
But I got to level 24 after, what,

462
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:00,540
that 25-ounce beer I drank.

463
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,320
But I mean, I've played stuff that I've liked,

464
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,480
but it's never been really enough to keep me.

465
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,400
I mean, I've taken it on trips and watched movies on it.

466
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,240
Now I have a netbook, so I watch movies on that instead.

467
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,920
Let's go to the chatters and see what they have to say.

468
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,260
Defective Candy in our chat room says,

469
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,640
kudos to them for taking the time

470
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,060
and trying to launch something solid instead of rushing it

471
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,200
like Nintendo.

472
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,240
SonicM88 says, Vita doesn't interest me.

473
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,120
I've never liked Sony's games.

474
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,720
Kitsune says, it may not carry all your favorite games yet,

475
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,560
but it definitely has a lot more than 3DS.

476
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,200
I'm psyched about the Vita.

477
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,760
Dungeonbuster says, doesn't really change my opinion either.

478
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,440
I have the same opinion that Loki does.

479
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,560
I just don't play handhelds all that much.

480
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:42,000
Mieglatov says, having played it at E3 this year,

481
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,400
it doesn't change my opinion.

482
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,400
Just makes me sad I have to wait longer.

483
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:49,120
Need sound shapes since it's like the Vita's luminous to me.

484
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,840
Spazinator says, I'd be interested in the Vita

485
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,420
if it'll print money, make me a sandwich,

486
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:54,920
and order me several slutty strippers every night.

487
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,480
You might be a little bit disappointed.

488
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,520
I don't think these slutty strippers will be in right away.

489
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,000
That could be in the 2.0 firmware though, so stay tuned.

490
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,880
Breakman says, it's a smart move for Sony

491
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,400
to move the Vita to next year.

492
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,700
They don't want to compare its sales

493
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,080
to the sales of the 3DS,

494
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,680
which I think will be one of the biggest Christmas gifts.

495
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:15,960
Interesting theory, maybe they did it to not compete

496
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,920
with the 3DS.

497
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,320
Maybe they want to hand this Christmas to Nintendo.

498
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,040
Maybe they're a little afraid of the competition.

499
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:27,220
Is that, does that sound too fanboy motivated or what?

500
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:35,100
I think it really just is a matter of putting out

501
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,780
a polished product because,

502
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,940
especially with the mistakes that Nintendo's made

503
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:42,320
with bringing the system out

504
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,880
and not having the right games for it,

505
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,540
that's really hurt their sales.

506
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:50,220
So I think that they're really just trying

507
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,060
to avoid that trap.

508
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:54,080
They've seen how it's bit Nintendo in the ass.

509
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,160
All right, well, let's move over and talk Nintendo then.

510
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,800
I was gonna move on and talk about the 3DS.

511
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,200
With the 3DS, there's some more comments

512
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,800
from Nintendo CEO, Satoru Iwata.

513
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,540
Of course, you all know who Iwata is.

514
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:06,880
He's the man at Nintendo.

515
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,840
He's talking about the 3DS and talking about

516
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:13,600
kind of the GameCube and how the two relates.

517
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,840
He said in an interview that the GameCube suffered

518
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,920
because Nintendo did not take opportunities

519
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,680
when they were available.

520
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,700
The general feeling within the company's management

521
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:25,060
is that the console had a chance to succeed,

522
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:28,640
but that the chance was not taken advantage of.

523
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,940
Iwata has said that the company learned its lesson

524
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:34,500
and that's why they did a price cut so soon after launch.

525
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,780
Interesting that they kind of brought up

526
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:38,700
the comparisons to the GameCube there.

527
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:43,500
Also, wanted to mention this with the 3DS price drop.

528
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,620
There's some rumors going around that Walmart

529
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:48,380
is going to drop the price early.

530
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:51,780
So if you wanna go to Walmart on August 9th,

531
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:54,940
that's the rumor anyway, they are supposedly dropping

532
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:58,720
the suggested retail price down a little early to the 170.

533
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,460
What this means is that you might be able

534
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:03,220
to get your cake and eat it too,

535
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:05,780
meaning if you can buy one of these things

536
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:08,500
in that window between the early price drop

537
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,780
and the price drop for everybody else,

538
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:12,000
quickly get it on the Nintendo eShop,

539
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,100
then you will be an early adopter.

540
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,100
So not only did you get the cheap 3DS,

541
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:19,380
but you got the $80 worth of games too.

542
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:22,060
So that's one way of working the system.

543
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:26,020
So I guess call your local Walmart or check.

544
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:28,380
Who knows, Nintendo may put the smack down on that though.

545
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,180
I don't know if they can.

546
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:32,180
Loki, I don't know if you know from the retail angle,

547
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:33,940
but could Nintendo stop this?

548
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:36,420
Like if Walmart wants to cut the price three days early,

549
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:38,020
can Nintendo stop that or no?

550
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:42,340
Well, here's a couple factors that they have in that.

551
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:45,480
One, whether there is map pricing on it or not,

552
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:49,820
which is the minimum advertised price.

553
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:52,280
So if they have map pricing in place on it,

554
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:56,420
it may prevent them from advertising it lower

555
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:58,740
than a certain amount.

556
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:01,100
Also, if they're being price protected on it,

557
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:05,140
any of those, fucking,

558
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:10,140
any of those units that they sold

559
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,360
prior to it dropping in price,

560
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,500
they don't get any of the money

561
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,420
from when it dropped in price.

562
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:18,520
So they would be eating the cost on that.

563
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:23,740
Now, I wouldn't see Walmart as a company doing this,

564
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:28,740
but I know that, and none of the people I know,

565
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:31,340
or work with in the industry do this,

566
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:33,340
but I know there's people out there to do that,

567
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:35,280
you can manipulate your price protection

568
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,420
by fudging the numbers, if you will,

569
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:40,420
and then saying, oh, I didn't really sell

570
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,540
as many units as I did,

571
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:43,460
and then you get the price protection,

572
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:45,320
and then you sold those units.

573
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:47,980
That's how you-

574
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:48,940
There's kind of ways to work this system,

575
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,780
but Walmart's probably too big to do that.

576
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:53,180
I wouldn't think they would be able to do that.

577
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:56,240
So, I don't know.

578
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,460
I don't think that they would be getting

579
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:59,500
any sort of special exception either,

580
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,940
but you never know.

581
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:05,080
Well, I mean, I think there's a very small group

582
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,580
that this would even really apply to,

583
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:09,740
because you're talking about people who won a 3DS,

584
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,460
who didn't already buy one,

585
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:14,140
who are really just waiting to seize an opportunity,

586
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:16,500
like it's like couponing or something.

587
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:20,060
You've got the extreme couponer crowd of video gamers.

588
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:23,260
I can't buy meat until Wednesday,

589
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,580
because then it's on sale.

590
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:26,800
Exactly, that's the crowd

591
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,940
that this type of thing calls to,

592
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:29,800
because that means you have to have $170

593
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,120
burning a hole in your pocket right now,

594
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,060
saying, I'm dropping it on a 3DS,

595
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:34,400
because I need to be an early adopter,

596
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,060
and I know I want a 3DS.

597
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:38,380
So, I don't know if that is really a whole lot of people,

598
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:42,120
but if it's you, start calling places on,

599
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,660
or even get out in the car,

600
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:47,180
and go to some different places on the 9th, what, Tuesday?

601
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:49,300
And I totally lost track of time.

602
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:50,380
Yes, that's Tuesday.

603
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:53,260
And go check out who might have dropped the price early,

604
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:54,100
because you never know.

605
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,980
And you have until, what, Thursday night

606
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,780
to connect that thing online

607
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:00,140
to be considered an early adopter.

608
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:01,820
Although, what's interesting is that

609
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,460
your system never really tells you

610
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,060
if you're an early adopter or not.

611
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:06,540
You just kind of have to hope that,

612
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:07,940
well, I connected to the eShop,

613
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:10,100
and, well, let's just hope I get lucky.

614
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,680
I downloaded a couple things from the eShop,

615
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:15,500
so I'm hoping that I'm considered an early adopter.

616
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,700
If not...

617
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:20,380
Rage, podcast rage.

618
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:22,220
It's pitchforks and torches.

619
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:24,020
Exactly, that's kind of where I'm at.

620
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:27,860
It's like, hey, wait, I have Zelda Color Game Boy

621
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,300
that I got for free, so clearly I had it during E3.

622
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:33,500
I bought this, like, was it almost day one or...

623
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,340
Was it day one?

624
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:36,100
I don't even remember when I bought that.

625
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:38,420
You bought, well, you had the Japanese 3DSs

626
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:39,620
like hecka early.

627
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:40,460
True.

628
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:44,540
But still, though, I had it almost like day one,

629
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:48,340
so I'm about to begin my fucking games.

630
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:49,360
I want my games.

631
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:52,780
I'm gonna come to your house.

632
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:55,100
All right, let's move on, Dark Sakura.

633
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:55,940
Twinbee.

634
00:25:57,420 --> 00:26:02,140
So, it's going to be the next game after Urban Champion

635
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:06,600
to get the 3D Classic deal done to it for the 3DS.

636
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,700
Anyone remember Twinbee?

637
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,420
I love Twinbee.

638
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:12,740
Wasn't it, didn't it have a different name,

639
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:13,780
like Stinger or something?

640
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:16,140
Yes, it was Stinger over here on the NES.

641
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,080
I did do a review, by the way, of Daytona Twinbee, so.

642
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,800
Twinbee is basically a top-down shooter

643
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:27,020
with cutesy little Twinbee and Winbee,

644
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:29,520
and you shoot bells for your power-ups

645
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,800
and all kinds of neat stuff.

646
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,840
So, it's going to be out in Japan on August 10th,

647
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:38,640
and hopefully we'll have it soon after.

648
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,240
I mean, we don't have Urban Champion yet,

649
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,440
but maybe we'll get it.

650
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,340
But Twinbee!

651
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,200
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.

652
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,220
Why this game?

653
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:49,120
It seems interesting that out of, like,

654
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:52,560
all the 3D remakes they could do, we're in Twinbee.

655
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,400
I honestly...

656
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,400
You've got to admit, it's not really

657
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,180
the first title you think of.

658
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:57,640
I think Twinbee, though,

659
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,680
if you look how the levels are laid out,

660
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:02,960
I think Twinbee does make sense on a graphic,

661
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,880
from a graphic sense,

662
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,600
because you've got your clouds

663
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,520
with all the bells hidden in them,

664
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,200
you've got your bottom layer with, you know,

665
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,000
so you can actually move your...

666
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,160
The same way that it's Xevious, basically.

667
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,080
Yeah, basically the same thing.

668
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,120
But I think it would work for the game.

669
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,360
I think it would be cute.

670
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:25,360
All right, interesting.

671
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,240
Going back a little bit,

672
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,280
since we're a little bit delayed

673
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,360
between when we say something

674
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,000
and when the live listeners hear it,

675
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,520
because the encoding and everything,

676
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,560
Kaijuto in chat says,

677
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,600
no, you'll know you're an early adopter

678
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,920
because your eShop list will have a section for it

679
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,040
like the PlayStation Network store did.

680
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:39,860
Really?

681
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:42,280
But how do we know the non-early adopters don't see that?

682
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,360
Because we haven't gotten that far yet.

683
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,160
Could just be a place that's in the store

684
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,840
as like a heads up or something.

685
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,720
Who knows?

686
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,540
Zether in chat says,

687
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:51,880
I hope Twinbee isn't Japan only for the 3DS.

688
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,160
It's a good game.

689
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,340
I would imagine if there's money to be made,

690
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,140
why not come out here?

691
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:59,960
But of course, I don't know, the whole region...

692
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,960
This is Nintendo we're talking about.

693
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:06,120
And the same could be said of the last story, Xenoblade.

694
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:06,960
I don't know.

695
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:08,900
Zether in chat says,

696
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:09,740
the thing is,

697
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:12,680
Stinger was actually the second Twinbee NES game.

698
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:17,320
So who knows what they might do with this 3D remake?

699
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,940
I probably won't buy it.

700
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:19,780
No, I mean...

701
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:21,400
There's just too much.

702
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,320
Honestly, if I was gonna go buy Twinbee,

703
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:26,240
I'd hook up my PC Engine and play my HuCard.

704
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,080
And play a good version of Twinbee.

705
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,680
Not the old NES premium.

706
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:32,220
I'm not saying the NES version is crap,

707
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:33,800
but I could play a good version.

708
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,180
I've got multiples, so...

709
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:37,020
Honestly, what I would do

710
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:38,880
is probably just play Parodius instead.

711
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,920
All right, let's move on with more news.

712
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:45,960
So the Humble Indie Bundle 3

713
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,840
has taken in a good,

714
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:51,540
was it $100 million in the first week.

715
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:56,540
And they've had over 215,000 downloads already.

716
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Of course, they've just expanded the bundle with Steel Storm.

717
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:06,080
And then of course the average price is just a little...

718
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,060
Well, at the time it was a little under five bucks.

719
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:10,120
Now it's just a little over five bucks.

720
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:15,120
And I guess Linux purchasers are paying a little bit more.

721
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,180
I had 11.62 as the average there.

722
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:23,200
Of course, they wouldn't just leave it there.

723
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,280
No, they're going to also

724
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:29,400
add Atom Zombie Smasher,

725
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,800
which is another free game

726
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,880
that they're gonna throw in there.

727
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:37,780
Also, if you buy the Humble Indie Bundle 3

728
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:39,120
over the average cost,

729
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,640
which is funny because it's been slowly creeping up.

730
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:45,820
I believe the last we checked was $5.69,

731
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:50,120
you can actually get the Humble Indie Bundle 2 as well.

732
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:53,300
So that's another six games thrown in there.

733
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,880
CRAN Physics Deluxe.

734
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,400
And yet it moves, VVVVV.

735
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:03,400
And then the set two was Braid Cortex Command Machinium.

736
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,960
I can't pronounce that shit.

737
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,540
Why can't I pronounce that shit?

738
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:12,980
Machinarium, I guess.

739
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:13,820
Machinarium.

740
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:14,640
Machinarium.

741
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,480
Thank you.

742
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,100
My mouth just didn't want to form the word.

743
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:19,700
It's like, bleh.

744
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:22,420
Okay, our mouth was mush for machinarium.

745
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:23,260
Yes.

746
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:26,260
Osmose and Revenge of the Titans.

747
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:29,220
You know it's a weird week at OLR

748
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:31,860
when I'm the one correcting people on pronunciation.

749
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:32,980
Like, what is up?

750
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:36,380
There's something, something is in these fries

751
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:37,500
the Dark Sakura made us.

752
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,620
Yeah, awesome.

753
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:40,900
Mouth numbing awesome.

754
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:43,560
I feel like suddenly it's that level in Yoshi's Island

755
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,460
where you touch fuzzy and you get dizzy

756
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:46,980
and all of a sudden it's like,

757
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:49,260
Loki's trying to read Machinarium and he's like,

758
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,180
Machinarium.

759
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:52,940
There's so much by the way.

760
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:54,160
What's that level?

761
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,000
Really?

762
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:55,960
Yes.

763
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:56,940
I'll get more dizzy.

764
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,500
Sounds fun.

765
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:01,900
She's totally, the garlic salt had crack in it or something.

766
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,480
I didn't use garlic salt.

767
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,260
I used garlic.

768
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:06,100
Oh, what was this?

769
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:08,140
Oh, it was like Himalayan salt.

770
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:09,500
Whatever.

771
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,100
Made with real Himalayans.

772
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:12,840
Anyhow.

773
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:13,660
Okay, back to the-

774
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:15,720
Made from the tears of Himalayans.

775
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,180
Back to the Humble Indie Bundle,

776
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:20,820
which may or may not be available in Himalaya.

777
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:23,020
How long are they selling this for anyways?

778
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:27,460
I think it's only for about another week.

779
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:29,500
I don't, it's a limited time.

780
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:32,060
I know that cause I totally missed it last year

781
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:33,740
cause I don't know, I was drunk or something.

782
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:36,140
I just totally missed it and I meant to get it

783
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:37,220
and I never did.

784
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:39,660
But this year, you betcha I got it,

785
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:41,220
especially because I'd heard such great things

786
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:43,060
about VVVVV and I wanted to try it for myself

787
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:44,060
and I'm really glad I did.

788
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:45,160
And I'm telling you guys,

789
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,340
for as many games as you get with this,

790
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:51,820
if you put in six bucks, you've got to get it.

791
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:56,140
So even if you're like starving student, whatever,

792
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:58,140
at least pay a dollar.

793
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:00,740
Go without a soda today and pay a dollar

794
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:04,320
for just the Humble Indie Bundle three games.

795
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:06,860
It's so worth it.

796
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:09,260
And the money goes to a good cause.

797
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,580
It goes to wherever you want it to go to.

798
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:13,900
You can split it between the different companies

799
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:14,740
and so forth.

800
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:16,380
I'm telling you, don't kick yourself later

801
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:17,740
when you miss out on this.

802
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:19,080
And don't be a cheapskate either.

803
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,480
If you can afford more than a dollar,

804
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,900
then give them 10 or whatever.

805
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,060
Give them as much as you would pay

806
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:26,980
for an Xbox Live Arcade game or what have you at least.

807
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:29,220
Cause I think the games are really worth it.

808
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:32,360
And I'd like to see a Humble Indie Bundle part four.

809
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:35,340
So what's that only day and a half.

810
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:37,460
It looks like, better hurry.

811
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:38,680
Day and a half.

812
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,820
You can have all the money go to charity if you want.

813
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:42,520
That's the cool thing about it.

814
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:45,100
So you better hurry up on that,

815
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:46,800
especially those of you listening to the podcast.

816
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,500
If it's after Monday night, you might already be screwed,

817
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:52,220
but you really got to check that out.

818
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:57,220
So, all right, moving on to something less humble.

819
00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:00,520
And wouldn't you know it, it's another story about Capcom.

820
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:03,820
Like I hate to keep kicking these guys week after week,

821
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:06,540
but something is up with the management at Capcom.

822
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:09,340
Like something has really changed

823
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:10,980
and not in a good way at Capcom.

824
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:12,300
And wait until you hear this.

825
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:14,100
Like we're going from Humble Indie Bundle,

826
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,660
pay what you want to this story.

827
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:21,100
Capcom is testing the waters in Japan on something.

828
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:25,420
It's a demo of a game called Nazu Waka Yakata.

829
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,900
It is a interesting title.

830
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:29,980
It doesn't use buttons on the 3DS.

831
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:32,060
It relies on sound and the microphone.

832
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:33,900
There's like this little trailer

833
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:35,940
that I'm playing in studio for the games.

834
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:37,900
We can kind of look at it here,

835
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:40,100
get the sense of what this game's all about.

836
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:42,420
I guess you-

837
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:49,540
I wonder if this is kind of like C-Man

838
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:50,580
or something where you talk

839
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:53,500
and interact with the on-screen characters.

840
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,900
It's kind of the sense I get.

841
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:57,180
It's like a creepy dude on screen.

842
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:58,820
It's a ghost.

843
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:03,820
He has no feet, he's a ghost.

844
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:06,820
It's like you kind of like explore these rooms and talk.

845
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:08,820
So that's the game, right?

846
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:10,740
I don't know if it's something that's planned

847
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:11,580
to come out here yet.

848
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:12,420
Creepy children.

849
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:13,380
That's right.

850
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:15,500
Anyhow, why is this important?

851
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,860
Because the demo that's coming out on the 3DS

852
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:20,420
is going to cost 200 yen.

853
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:21,500
That would be about the equivalent

854
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,820
of $2.50 here in America.

855
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:28,820
What we are talking about is a paid demo for the game.

856
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,980
Now, granted, that's a cheap demo

857
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:32,380
and one could argue that, well,

858
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:35,100
you're still getting to play at least part of the game,

859
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:38,780
but doesn't something strike you as really, really wrong

860
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:40,700
about the concept of a paid demo,

861
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:43,500
especially from a company that's thrived on

862
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,860
great word of mouth from free demos throughout the years?

863
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:47,540
Like, I don't know, Dead Rising.

864
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:50,860
Like a lot of people decided they wanted that game

865
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:51,740
based off the demo.

866
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:53,980
Lost Planet, same type of thing, right?

867
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:56,580
So why now a change in the strategy?

868
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:59,100
Was this maybe a part of the whole,

869
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:02,420
they were gonna charge for the Mega Man Legends 3 prototype,

870
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:04,220
which was essentially a paid demo?

871
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:06,420
Like, what is going on?

872
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:08,460
What do you guys think of paid demos?

873
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:09,540
Is it a rip?

874
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:10,380
Or is it worth it?

875
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:11,860
It depends on how much of the game you're getting.

876
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:12,700
Yeah.

877
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:16,500
Because if it is like a really in-depth demo,

878
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,700
then yeah, I can see $2.50 forward.

879
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,540
I mean, keep in mind,

880
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:22,500
I used to get the PlayStation,

881
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,820
people used to just basically buy

882
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:26,180
the PlayStation Magazine thing for the demo discs.

883
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:27,780
No, that's true, that's true.

884
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:28,620
That's an interesting comparison.

885
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:30,380
And the same was done with the Xbox Magazine,

886
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:32,180
same was done with Dreamcast.

887
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:36,140
Because I have a bunch of demo discs from magazines

888
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:37,860
because I wanted to try out the game

889
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:38,700
that was on the demo disc,

890
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,340
and the only way you could get it was on the magazine.

891
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:41,740
You still got a magazine, though.

892
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:43,580
That was the thing, you're buying the magazine.

893
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:46,100
Whether you're buying the magazine for the disc

894
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,280
or buying it for whatever,

895
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,860
that was paid for by advertisers.

896
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:51,220
And you could say the disc is tangible.

897
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:54,460
I mean, but it's an interesting comparison

898
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:55,300
I haven't heard yet.

899
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,660
Well, it's not the first time

900
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:58,180
that they've done this kind of crap.

901
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:00,500
I mean, look at, you know,

902
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:03,820
you might even say like Dead Rising Case Zero

903
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:06,900
or whatever was a paid demo.

904
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,960
Because it's an Xbox Live Arcade game.

905
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:13,740
Oh, I'm sorry, it was a prequel to Dead Rising 2.

906
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:16,960
Yeah, whatever, okay, it was basically a demo.

907
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:20,520
So you gave the demo a unique storyline

908
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,560
that tied into the actual game.

909
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,240
I kind of looked at it as DLC

910
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,100
that didn't require the game.

911
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:28,160
That's, and that's why I kind of let it slide.

912
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,620
It was something extra that wasn't actually in the game

913
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:32,240
that, you know, had its own achievements,

914
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,720
it had its own ranking,

915
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,720
it was its own kind of standalone thing.

916
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,800
Well, what if, you know,

917
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,280
for people who've bought the demo for the game,

918
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:43,120
they get something cool when the actual game comes out?

919
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,720
What if that's associated with it?

920
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,580
Because we don't have that detail.

921
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:49,420
You know, it's funny,

922
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:51,120
kind of a similar comment we have in chat.

923
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,620
Chalice's pop in our chat room says,

924
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:54,440
if it was a pre-order bonus disc

925
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,240
that came with a cash deposit,

926
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,540
or I could use that money down

927
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:59,440
against the retail version of the game,

928
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,520
and I don't buy it my loss, then I'd be okay with it.

929
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,680
But to buy a demo and then buy the retail version

930
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,200
for full price, I don't know,

931
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:09,520
I just wait for reviews and go straight to the retail.

932
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,160
See, I think that they're gonna have to work out

933
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:13,740
some sort of perk with that or it's gonna fail.

934
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:16,200
They have to give people incentive to,

935
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:19,000
especially for such a bizarre looking game.

936
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,200
What an interesting way that digital distribution

937
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,040
could go though.

938
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:26,680
Imagine if, and I guess to some extent one could argue

939
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,560
you kind of have this already with some things,

940
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:33,160
but what if like you could play the first stage of a game

941
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:36,120
by paying two bucks, and then if you like it,

942
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,760
you buy the entire game for an extra 38?

943
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:42,420
Isn't that kind of how the Xbox arcade thing?

944
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:46,180
You don't pay for those demos.

945
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:48,020
But since you brought up Xbox.

946
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:50,060
But I mean you could pay a couple of levels

947
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:52,380
and then if you had to do one of the game in your arcade,

948
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:53,680
wasn't that like?

949
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:54,520
Game room?

950
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,360
Yeah.

951
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,180
Sorta?

952
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:57,020
Yeah.

953
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:57,860
Kinda.

954
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:58,680
Kinda.

955
00:37:58,680 --> 00:37:59,520
I don't know, game room was kind of its own thing.

956
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,360
I get what you're going with that though.

957
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:03,060
But I think more about Fable 2, I think they did this.

958
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:06,300
I think they chopped up Fable 2 into like six chapters

959
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,280
and they put it out as episodes.

960
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,280
So they kinda did something like this.

961
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:12,260
But I mean it was a while after the whole thing

962
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:13,100
had already been released.

963
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:13,940
Like they just wanted to sell

964
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:16,340
as many freaking copies of that game any way they could.

965
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:18,900
Slice it, dice it, circumcise it,

966
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:21,540
whatever you gotta do to sell the game

967
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:23,820
bit by bit, little by little.

968
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:24,640
Yeah.

969
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,480
So.

970
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,320
Milk that franchise.

971
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,820
Exactly.

972
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:29,900
Dungeon Buster says Wolf 3D gave you

973
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:31,380
the first few levels for free

974
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:33,300
and then if you wanted the whole game then you paid.

975
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,380
You didn't pay up front, same with Doom.

976
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:38,300
One could argue that you might have paid

977
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:39,140
for Wolfenstein 3D.

978
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:41,420
No, I did pay for shareware.

979
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:42,260
You had to buy the shareware disk.

980
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:44,940
Because you used to have to buy the disks.

981
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:47,220
You would go buy the floppies at the store

982
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:48,860
that already had it on there.

983
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:51,460
So that was fine, but here's the thing though

984
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:53,660
about shareware for the most part.

985
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:57,340
Shareware, you could enjoy the game as a whole

986
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:58,620
with just the shareware.

987
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:01,860
Like you would get one campaign of it I guess.

988
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:03,800
But you could get the additional campaigns

989
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,020
if you had the full disk.

990
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:07,500
Like Wolfenstein, you play through the whole first campaign

991
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:10,740
but there was four campaigns total with the full version.

992
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:12,540
This is a demo.

993
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:15,500
This is not, you know, part of the game.

994
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:17,220
This is the demo.

995
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:21,680
This is Capcom figuring out ways to be dicks.

996
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:27,460
I mean, whether it's locking saves or weird DRM,

997
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:29,940
it's their way of, you know,

998
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:33,180
how can we make more money and fuck people over?

999
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:35,140
Because that's what we do best, Capcom.

1000
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:38,100
Whoa, but this is not the same Capcom from a year ago

1001
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:40,220
that started Mega Man Legends in the first place.

1002
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:42,940
Is Bobby Kotick running Capcom for some reason?

1003
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:45,140
Did he like just all of a sudden,

1004
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:48,660
is he like Fred Savage where he wears

1005
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:50,380
a bunch of different skin suits?

1006
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:52,700
Did Activision buy Capcom and we just didn't hear?

1007
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:54,060
Like is that what happened?

1008
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:57,580
So, all right.

1009
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:01,580
Anyhow, I guess at the end of the day,

1010
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:03,860
if you don't like it, don't buy it.

1011
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:04,700
That's how they'll get the message.

1012
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:06,340
Well, it's a weird Japanese game

1013
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:07,820
that will probably never make it over here

1014
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:09,700
so that is easy enough.

1015
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,700
And I'm saying it to the Japanese listeners,

1016
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,340
all three of you.

1017
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:16,340
Let's see, Kitsune, Ikuma JP, and I think there's one other.

1018
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:20,220
All three of you, make a stand.

1019
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:24,120
Three out of three OLR listeners in Japan reject this game.

1020
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:26,460
All right, moving on.

1021
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:29,300
Well, how about some news about harmonics?

1022
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,980
We haven't really heard from them in a while, have we?

1023
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:32,000
I heart harmonics.

1024
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:32,840
What's new with harmonics?

1025
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,580
Whatever happened to that, sorry,

1026
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:35,660
I know this isn't what you're reporting on,

1027
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:37,340
but whatever happened to that freaking game

1028
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:38,560
they were supposed to announce at E3

1029
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,300
that kind of disappeared.

1030
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:44,580
What, you mean vid rhythm?

1031
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:45,620
Yeah, vid rhythm.

1032
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:47,920
They didn't say much about it.

1033
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:52,140
No real details yet, but anyway, they're happy.

1034
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:54,140
They like not being a part of Viacom

1035
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:57,260
or any other calm there is.

1036
00:40:57,260 --> 00:41:00,140
In fact, Tracy Rosenthal Newsome,

1037
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:02,460
who is the VP of production,

1038
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,940
said it's been a terrific opportunity.

1039
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:07,860
And I quote, we are very well supported,

1040
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:09,460
but really the most important thing

1041
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:11,080
is that there's a huge amount of creative energy

1042
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:14,020
that has bubbled up during our independence.

1043
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:16,580
They've been in development of Dance Central 2

1044
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:18,900
and they're putting small games together,

1045
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:21,060
making prototypes and innovating.

1046
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:24,420
So they are still working on vid rhythm,

1047
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:26,460
which there's not too many details,

1048
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:30,300
but it's just been described as fun.

1049
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:31,420
They're not giving a timeline,

1050
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:33,740
but we'll be hearing about it soon is what she said.

1051
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:38,740
Well, vid rhythm is made up of vid and rhythm and fun.

1052
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:44,100
But right now the focus is on Rock Band DLC.

1053
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:47,100
And it's saying that Rock Band 3

1054
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:48,800
still has tons of life left in it.

1055
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:54,300
So we can be expecting, of course,

1056
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:57,500
Dance Central 2 on connect in fall.

1057
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:02,540
Any thoughts on possible Rock Band 4 next year?

1058
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:04,300
Or do you think, no, it's still too soon to bring?

1059
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:05,140
Thinks too soon.

1060
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:06,060
You think, really?

1061
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:06,900
Yeah.

1062
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:10,220
I really do think it is too soon.

1063
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:11,940
I was randomly thinking about that the other day

1064
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:14,100
as like, well, obviously all those games

1065
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:16,420
took this year off, except for Dance Central,

1066
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:18,420
but the plastic instrument games

1067
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:20,340
will say are taking the year off.

1068
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:25,240
And they're saying that Guitar Hero is not dead.

1069
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,980
I think they've said Rock Band's not dead,

1070
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:28,980
but they're all taking a break.

1071
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:31,540
But I wonder if it's a break until next year,

1072
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:33,260
or maybe it's gonna be a break long enough

1073
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:36,700
for the next wave of consoles as well.

1074
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:37,620
That's a good thought.

1075
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:40,820
I mean, I think right now is just they're really

1076
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:43,300
trying to avoid that oversaturation.

1077
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:45,700
They've got a good product now.

1078
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:47,120
They're still selling something

1079
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:49,820
without having to develop anything new right now.

1080
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:51,140
So as long as it's selling

1081
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:53,620
and as long as people keep buying the download packs,

1082
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:56,620
then there's no reason for them to make a new one yet.

1083
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:58,180
Well, and Dance Central 2

1084
00:42:58,180 --> 00:43:00,540
is probably gonna sell really well.

1085
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:03,020
It'll probably stay a huge connect seller

1086
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:03,860
through the holidays.

1087
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:07,140
So I think everybody knows it, you know.

1088
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:08,340
First one was a quality connect.

1089
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:09,860
I like dance masters.

1090
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:11,540
Ew.

1091
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:15,380
All right, let's travel around the world

1092
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:16,460
and look at some release dates

1093
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:18,060
and see what you can get a whole lot sooner

1094
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:20,140
than the holidays as in next week.

1095
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:22,160
What's coming out next week in America?

1096
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:26,100
Not much of anything.

1097
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:27,660
Hasn't that been like this,

1098
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:29,900
the reaction for like the past four weeks?

1099
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:30,740
Well, no.

1100
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:31,580
Nothing has freaking come out of here.

1101
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:34,980
There was actually stuff last week

1102
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:36,480
or this week, I should say.

1103
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:40,260
No, the next week, there really is hardly anything.

1104
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:42,180
I mean, here's what we got

1105
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:43,380
and I'll run it down real quick.

1106
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:44,700
Wait, can I say this real quick though?

1107
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:45,720
It did make the show real tonight,

1108
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:46,780
but there was a big press release

1109
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:50,360
about how Catherine is Atlas's biggest launch seller ever.

1110
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:52,540
It's already sold like 200,000 copies.

1111
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:54,300
I gotta admit, there is this cynical part of me

1112
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:55,540
that's kind of like, you sold that much

1113
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:57,560
because there's nothing else to buy right now.

1114
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:00,480
There is nothing else.

1115
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,500
It also helps that you put a woman

1116
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:04,040
with large breasts on your...

1117
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:04,880
Yeah, that helps too.

1118
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:05,720
That does help too, yeah.

1119
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:08,560
And all the trailers have been, you know,

1120
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:10,100
her sleeping with a dude.

1121
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:13,320
It just shows, America wants porno games.

1122
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:15,860
Think about it.

1123
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:17,080
Yeah, they do.

1124
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:20,840
All right, here's what we got coming out next week.

1125
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:22,020
All DS titles.

1126
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:24,340
Touch and Play Collection on the Nintendo DS.

1127
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:25,420
It's a bunch of casual games.

1128
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:27,060
Hurrah.

1129
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:28,740
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.

1130
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:30,900
It's an adventure game on the DS.

1131
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:33,340
And Puzzler World 2.

1132
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:35,780
Once again, another collection of casual puzzle games.

1133
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:36,660
That is it.

1134
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:37,500
Done.

1135
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:39,820
Nothing else to report on.

1136
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:41,700
Is it because kids are getting ready to go back to school?

1137
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:43,260
No, it's just a dead week.

1138
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:44,100
I don't know.

1139
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:46,420
A week after there's some stuff.

1140
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:50,820
It's just, you know, I don't know.

1141
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:51,660
All right.

1142
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:52,800
Well, let's travel to Japan

1143
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,300
and look at the Japanese release dates.

1144
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:56,860
Let's see if it's a similar story over there.

1145
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:57,740
Well, I'll tell you this.

1146
00:44:57,740 --> 00:45:00,320
On the Xbox 360 this week, nothing.

1147
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:03,020
Nothing coming out on the 360 this week.

1148
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:04,820
Going over to the PlayStation 3.

1149
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:08,660
WWE All-Stars is released this week from THQ.

1150
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:10,000
So, I guess you have that.

1151
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:14,140
Going to the Nintendo systems,

1152
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:16,440
seeing if there's anything coming out there.

1153
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:21,100
Actually, I have the PSP up first on my list.

1154
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:25,620
There's Monhuniki, Poka Poka, Ailou Muraji,

1155
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:29,720
and then Uta No, Prince Sama Repeat.

1156
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:31,420
Yes, those are the two games coming out.

1157
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:33,460
Uta means song or theme.

1158
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:35,580
That first one, the Monhuniki,

1159
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:39,740
is a farm, fish, and hunt monsters RPG on the PSP.

1160
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:41,940
And then the second one there is,

1161
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:45,780
it looks like it's from Broccoli.

1162
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:48,000
Oh, oh, oh, let me look at it.

1163
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,560
I thought Broccoli went into business.

1164
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:50,780
Nope, they're still there.

1165
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:53,180
And it looks like it might be like a...

1166
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:55,520
It's a dating sim for girls.

1167
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:56,360
Kinda.

1168
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:57,280
It's a pretty boy.

1169
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:59,000
Yeah, pretty boy dating sim.

1170
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,920
Theme of the Prince Repeat.

1171
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:04,580
Oh, it could be like a redo.

1172
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:05,880
If it's called Repeat,

1173
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:08,420
it could be like a re-release or something like that.

1174
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:09,600
Or a special edition.

1175
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,120
Whatever, I don't think anyone here

1176
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:12,480
is gonna be importing that.

1177
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:16,120
Kitsune, Ikuma, JP, any interest in that game?

1178
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:18,320
I'm thinking no.

1179
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:19,640
And that's it.

1180
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:20,720
You go to the Wii, there's nothing.

1181
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:23,320
3DS, Super Pokemon Scramble.

1182
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:24,640
I guess that's kind of a big deal.

1183
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,160
It is a Pokemon game coming out.

1184
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:29,240
It's not an official Pokemon black or white

1185
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:30,320
type of Pokemon game,

1186
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:32,780
but it is a Pokemon related universe game.

1187
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:34,720
That's probably the biggest release this week.

1188
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:36,960
Unless you wanna get a new pouch for your 3DS

1189
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,000
with Street Fighter characters on it.

1190
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,440
There you go.

1191
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:43,800
Your very busy release day schedule in Japan.

1192
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:44,880
How about your...

1193
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,300
There's a few things.

1194
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:49,080
Actually, today, I guess already,

1195
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:52,320
Dragon Quest Monsters Joker 2 came out.

1196
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:54,680
On the 10th, we have Fruit Ninja Connect,

1197
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:58,120
and Hysteria Project 2 for PSP and PlayStation 3.

1198
00:46:58,120 --> 00:47:00,640
And on the 11th, we have Edge, and that's it.

1199
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:03,560
Meh.

1200
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:05,160
Thank God we do have some people in Japan

1201
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:06,520
who actually listen to this show.

1202
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:09,000
Kitsune actually is jumping in saying,

1203
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,880
Utuno Prince Sama is actually an anime in Japan.

1204
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:14,520
So it is an actual anime.

1205
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:16,320
Let's see, I'm actually trying to...

1206
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:21,320
Oh, opening theme.

1207
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:29,160
Looks very...

1208
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:30,080
Yeah, I wanna play that.

1209
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:30,920
Shoujo.

1210
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:32,640
I'll watch it.

1211
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:33,720
Ah.

1212
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:36,200
Just watching that trailer gave me a period.

1213
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:37,040
All right.

1214
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:39,920
No ice cream for you.

1215
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:42,280
Moving on.

1216
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:43,940
More gaming news, Loki.

1217
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:48,020
Ah, that's a very wonderful image.

1218
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:51,140
So...

1219
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:52,580
I got a uterus, let's make a baby.

1220
00:47:56,180 --> 00:47:57,260
Chirp, chirp.

1221
00:47:57,260 --> 00:48:02,260
Yes, the studio behind Minecraft, Mojang,

1222
00:48:03,620 --> 00:48:06,940
they have been threatened with lawsuit

1223
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:11,740
over their new game called Scrolls.

1224
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:15,280
Apparently, Scrolls is a card game.

1225
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,340
Like a card RPG strategy game or whatever.

1226
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:24,820
And it kinda looks a little medieval-ish.

1227
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:26,220
And so Bethesda's saying,

1228
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:28,660
hey, that infringes on our own trademark,

1229
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:30,100
the Elder Scrolls.

1230
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:36,860
I don't know if I'd buy that.

1231
00:48:36,860 --> 00:48:39,700
Because they have the monopoly on Scrolls.

1232
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:40,660
Exactly.

1233
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:41,900
That's what it is.

1234
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:44,140
This reminds me of, God, what was that?

1235
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:46,980
It was the Mirror's Edge stuff.

1236
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:48,220
And I think it was Edge,

1237
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:50,620
or something about using Edge in a game

1238
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:53,060
was inappropriate or whatever.

1239
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:54,180
The guys tried to sue.

1240
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:56,340
Oh, well, it's just like, was it Monster?

1241
00:48:57,420 --> 00:49:00,560
Monster Cables, they sue everybody

1242
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:03,300
that uses the word monster and stuff.

1243
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:08,100
Even if it has nothing to do with cables,

1244
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:12,420
electronics, anything, yes.

1245
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:14,900
These people are what we call assholes.

1246
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:18,260
Or their lawyers are assholes.

1247
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:21,420
I'm sorry, when it's a generic,

1248
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:22,780
it would be different if it was like

1249
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:25,400
the Elder Cards or something like that.

1250
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:27,660
Okay, you got something there, maybe.

1251
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:30,920
But if a word scrolls,

1252
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:34,820
which no one owns a trademark to the word scrolls,

1253
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:36,500
you have the Elder Scrolls.

1254
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:41,500
If it was like the Elder Card Scrolls battle game.

1255
00:49:41,540 --> 00:49:44,540
The Elder Parchments, Armageddon.

1256
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:47,780
You know, if it was something like that,

1257
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:49,860
then yeah, you might have a case.

1258
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:52,420
But it's just too damn generic.

1259
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:54,120
And honestly, I don't think they're gonna win,

1260
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:57,120
even if they did end up going through with a lawsuit.

1261
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:59,640
They're just playing the tactic right now

1262
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:02,000
where it's like, oh, we're big bad Bethesda.

1263
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:05,900
You know, we're gonna file a lawsuit against you,

1264
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:09,100
so you little indie developer better do what we want.

1265
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:11,380
Why do big companies have to be bullies like that?

1266
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:14,860
It's kind of a double-edged sword everywhere.

1267
00:50:14,860 --> 00:50:17,140
It's basically, they have to protect

1268
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:19,860
their intellectual properties,

1269
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:21,580
but at the same time, they kind of overstep

1270
00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:24,100
their boundaries and try to go after people

1271
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:25,780
that really aren't trying to infringe

1272
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:27,300
on their intellectual properties,

1273
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:29,500
and that's what's going on here.

1274
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:32,420
It's because the people that make the games

1275
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:34,840
aren't necessarily the suits and the lawyers

1276
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:36,460
that are actually going after these people.

1277
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:39,640
It's separate entities altogether.

1278
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:43,860
All right.

1279
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:48,460
Clearly, this will get settled out of court,

1280
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:49,760
which means they're probably gonna end up

1281
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:51,900
being forced to change the name, and then that's it,

1282
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:53,180
which is ridiculous.

1283
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:55,340
I hope they kind of stick to their guns and don't do it.

1284
00:50:55,340 --> 00:50:56,920
Call it mind scrolls.

1285
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:57,760
There you go.

1286
00:50:59,260 --> 00:51:00,140
All right, let's move on,

1287
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:03,000
talk about some Kinect news related on the Xbox.

1288
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,060
Apparently, a rating has been spotted

1289
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:08,020
for Kinect Fun Labs Air Band.

1290
00:51:08,020 --> 00:51:11,620
I guess that is the next Fun Lab that's gonna come out.

1291
00:51:11,620 --> 00:51:14,600
Did you guys know that that whole Be in a Talk Show thing

1292
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:15,600
came out for Fun Labs?

1293
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:16,440
I have yet to play it.

1294
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:17,280
Fun Labs, what?

1295
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:18,520
And I guess Sparkler's out too.

1296
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:19,360
Huh?

1297
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:22,020
I thought that was Avatar Kinect,

1298
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:23,780
not, you know, that was something separate.

1299
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:25,300
That's what it's called, Avatar Kinect.

1300
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:27,060
Yeah, that came out, and then the Sparkler thing

1301
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:28,420
that they were showing at E3 came out.

1302
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:29,260
I haven't played either one.

1303
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:31,140
Yeah, I don't care about either one of those.

1304
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:32,880
Dark Soccer, at some point, you should take your Kinect

1305
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:33,780
out of the box.

1306
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:34,620
It'll work a lot better.

1307
00:51:34,620 --> 00:51:37,000
As soon as someone lends me as dance masters.

1308
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:37,840
No.

1309
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:39,300
You said you were gonna lend it to me.

1310
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:41,100
You have Kinect adventures to play.

1311
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:41,940
Go rafting.

1312
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:44,020
No, don't go rafting.

1313
00:51:45,020 --> 00:51:46,760
You can do Avatar Kinect.

1314
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:50,200
You can host your own Oprah show as your avatar.

1315
00:51:52,940 --> 00:51:56,160
You can do Kinect, okay, okay, Kinect Sparkler.

1316
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:58,380
It's kind of like having fire in your hands.

1317
00:51:59,260 --> 00:52:00,100
You don't like fire?

1318
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:01,580
I don't want to para para.

1319
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:03,980
It's kind of like if fire was lame.

1320
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:10,260
And really, you know, how can you make fire lame?

1321
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:11,740
You can't, but yet,

1322
00:52:12,860 --> 00:52:16,400
Kinect's Fun Labs manages to make fire lame.

1323
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:17,260
All right, so I guess,

1324
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:19,020
Kinect Fun Labs Air Band's probably coming.

1325
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:21,460
I want to say, when they did the whole voting

1326
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:23,540
on the different, like, labs to come out,

1327
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:26,380
wasn't one of them like a keyboard that you could play,

1328
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:28,300
like, in that scene from Big,

1329
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:30,780
but you didn't actually need a keyboard on the ground?

1330
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:32,100
Like, that was one of the whole,

1331
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:33,260
that's what this sounds like.

1332
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:34,600
Oh, I really hope it is.

1333
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:35,440
I really hope it is,

1334
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:38,140
because I could relive that scene from Big

1335
00:52:38,140 --> 00:52:39,160
over and over again,

1336
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:42,300
and I will be the life of my own party.

1337
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:43,140
Hold on, though.

1338
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:44,660
In about another year,

1339
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:46,620
wouldn't something like that entertain Josh

1340
00:52:46,620 --> 00:52:48,140
for, like, 15 minutes at least?

1341
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:48,980
No.

1342
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:49,820
No?

1343
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:52,780
It's not even a babysitter?

1344
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:53,620
No.

1345
00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:54,500
No?

1346
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:55,340
No.

1347
00:52:56,220 --> 00:52:58,220
Connect-O-Moles would entertain him,

1348
00:52:58,220 --> 00:53:01,820
but, you know, Kinect Fun Labs, no.

1349
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:03,420
It's just like, hey, look, haha,

1350
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:04,540
look at all these indie guys

1351
00:53:04,540 --> 00:53:05,940
who are doing all these hacks and stuff.

1352
00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:08,060
We want a piece of that action, you know?

1353
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:09,740
Come to Kinect, because it's fun.

1354
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:11,760
It's whimsical.

1355
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:17,020
No, all this shit's gonna be is fucking Wii music, okay?

1356
00:53:17,020 --> 00:53:20,580
That's all this bullshit Wii music.

1357
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:23,460
God, even saying the word Wii music

1358
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:27,300
just flashes me back to the E3 press conference

1359
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:31,380
where Miyamoto comes out playing a fucking fake,

1360
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:34,060
you know, saxophone thing, and how lame that was.

1361
00:53:34,060 --> 00:53:36,560
It's just like, ah, it burns!

1362
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:38,900
It's so terrible.

1363
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:39,860
It's like you're suffering from

1364
00:53:39,860 --> 00:53:41,980
post-traumatic stress disorder or something.

1365
00:53:41,980 --> 00:53:45,920
I'm suing Nintendo, PTSD from their damn conference.

1366
00:53:47,780 --> 00:53:48,620
All right, well, I don't know

1367
00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:50,340
if you'll wanna sue Microsoft over this,

1368
00:53:50,340 --> 00:53:53,540
but they are trying to put out more Kinect games.

1369
00:53:53,540 --> 00:53:56,020
They are actually saying one Kinect-enabled

1370
00:53:56,020 --> 00:53:58,540
Xbox Live Arcade game a month.

1371
00:53:58,540 --> 00:54:00,660
That's something they're trying to do there.

1372
00:54:01,540 --> 00:54:05,860
That is according to product marketing manager Robin Burrow.

1373
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:08,740
Quote, we're targeting a frequency of about one a month

1374
00:54:08,740 --> 00:54:10,300
for Xbox Live Arcade portfolio

1375
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:11,920
that will have Kinect integration.

1376
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:14,860
That will be really powerful and differentiate the platform.

1377
00:54:14,860 --> 00:54:17,700
Of course, coming out very soon, Fruit Ninja Kinect.

1378
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:19,340
We'll kick things off.

1379
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:22,920
Fruit Ninja Kinect, eh, that's stupid, silly fun.

1380
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:24,980
But some of the other stuff that they had,

1381
00:54:24,980 --> 00:54:27,500
you know, like the new Burnout game,

1382
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:29,620
just makes me wanna cry.

1383
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:34,220
It's just, it's Burnout, a great franchise,

1384
00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:37,100
great racing game, and we have this top-down thing

1385
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:39,700
where I gotta hop up and down to make my car explode.

1386
00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:42,620
Lame.

1387
00:54:42,620 --> 00:54:46,020
This isn't Micro Machines, this is fucking Burnout.

1388
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:47,540
If I wanna play Micro Machines,

1389
00:54:47,540 --> 00:54:51,640
the top-down racing game from like the 90s,

1390
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:54,940
I'd play Micro Machines, maybe 80s.

1391
00:54:54,940 --> 00:54:56,180
Might be before the 90s.

1392
00:54:57,380 --> 00:54:58,540
Freaking John Machida.

1393
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:01,740
That's what I'm talking about.

1394
00:55:03,060 --> 00:55:05,480
All right, let's move on, I guess,

1395
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:06,900
to the classic game of the week.

1396
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:09,900
We're just running through the news tonight.

1397
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:11,260
It's kind of a slow news week.

1398
00:55:11,260 --> 00:55:12,560
It's hard to fill a three-hour show

1399
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:14,900
when there's not too much going on outside of

1400
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:17,500
kids going back to school and so forth,

1401
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:20,260
especially, look at what's coming out

1402
00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:21,880
this week in games, nothing.

1403
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:25,380
So why not go back and revisit a classic?

1404
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:26,380
Every week here on the show,

1405
00:55:26,380 --> 00:55:28,420
Dark Sakura takes a step into the vault,

1406
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:30,060
finds a classic video game that she thinks,

1407
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:35,060
hey, you ungrateful brats, study this.

1408
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:36,180
It's a classic video game of the week.

1409
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:37,580
Dark Sakura, what game did you pick

1410
00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:38,420
for your classic video games?

1411
00:55:38,420 --> 00:55:39,860
I picked a really fucked up game,

1412
00:55:39,860 --> 00:55:41,340
game series, I should say.

1413
00:55:41,340 --> 00:55:42,420
Black Matrix.

1414
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:45,300
It's actually Black Slash Matrix.

1415
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:46,540
Is that like Keanu Reeves?

1416
00:55:46,540 --> 00:55:48,780
Whoa, I know what a fool.

1417
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:52,300
It's actually a tactical RPG series.

1418
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:55,420
And it's sort of like,

1419
00:55:56,260 --> 00:55:58,020
it kind of does like a mimicking

1420
00:55:58,020 --> 00:55:59,860
of Christian religious themes,

1421
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:01,700
but it's kind of different.

1422
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:03,360
It has heaven, hell, earth,

1423
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,140
and all the people that live there.

1424
00:56:05,140 --> 00:56:07,980
And the first one came out in 1998

1425
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:09,740
for the Sega Saturn.

1426
00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:13,040
And it was just so weird.

1427
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:15,820
Okay, first of all, you play as

1428
00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:20,220
a different character who belongs

1429
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:22,460
to a dominatrix of some sort.

1430
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:24,760
And then you fight, sort of like,

1431
00:56:26,540 --> 00:56:27,940
you've got your move, your attack,

1432
00:56:27,940 --> 00:56:30,620
your item, that's all a turn-based

1433
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:32,580
strategy game type of game.

1434
00:56:32,580 --> 00:56:34,700
I didn't really quite get into it,

1435
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:36,300
but it had a very interesting story,

1436
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:37,580
I should put it that way.

1437
00:56:37,580 --> 00:56:40,500
You also had counters, you could defend,

1438
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:42,180
you could dodge attacks.

1439
00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:44,260
You also had a waiting attack.

1440
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:46,380
You also had magic commands.

1441
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:50,340
You also had different spell effectiveness

1442
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:51,780
that changed from turn to turn

1443
00:56:51,780 --> 00:56:54,620
that was controlled by biorhythms.

1444
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:57,260
You had, instead of magic points,

1445
00:56:57,260 --> 00:56:59,300
you had blood points, and you can distribute

1446
00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:01,860
your blood points to all the usable characters

1447
00:57:01,860 --> 00:57:03,740
to use for their spell casting.

1448
00:57:03,740 --> 00:57:07,580
And you get more by attacking defeated enemies.

1449
00:57:07,580 --> 00:57:11,800
So you basically kill them and steal their blood.

1450
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:14,520
And then you can actually put blood points

1451
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:18,840
into weapons to unleash a special attack,

1452
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:20,920
called its latent ability,

1453
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:23,760
or you could make it more effective.

1454
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:25,600
You could add different types of damage

1455
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:28,480
that the weapon would deal.

1456
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:31,520
And then after each battle, you get a letter grade rank,

1457
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:32,760
depending on how well you did.

1458
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:35,680
And so you get bonus items, money, and experience,

1459
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:37,960
depending on how well you did in battle,

1460
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:40,000
which I thought was a really cool system.

1461
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,640
So basically, the main character of the first one

1462
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:45,800
is named Abel, who is an amnesiac,

1463
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:50,240
and he is the main protagonist of Black Matrix.

1464
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:55,920
He's basically an angel, and he's locked up in the prison

1465
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:57,260
for the crime of love.

1466
00:57:58,360 --> 00:58:02,560
And he can change Black Wings into White Wings

1467
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:03,800
and all kinds of different stuff.

1468
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:06,320
And then you get your different masters,

1469
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:07,640
your dominatrixes.

1470
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:10,600
You know, you have Domina, Purica,

1471
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:13,720
Michette, Purecious, and Prague.

1472
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:17,840
So, who I always used to just call plague.

1473
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:21,120
But you also could get a male master named Zero

1474
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:23,060
who was available after a code.

1475
00:58:23,060 --> 00:58:24,680
So you have all kinds of different ones.

1476
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:27,420
Then Black Matrix 2 came out.

1477
00:58:28,420 --> 00:58:29,640
Actually, let me go back.

1478
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:33,560
I should actually talk about Black Matrix AD Advanced,

1479
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:37,560
and then Black Matrix Cross are in the same series.

1480
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:39,960
They're the same game, pretty much.

1481
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:42,560
They just add different elements to the game.

1482
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:44,440
So I forgot to mention those.

1483
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:46,840
And then we got, okay, Black Matrix 2 came out

1484
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:50,240
for the PlayStation 2 on March 28th, 2002,

1485
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:52,680
and it's set in the hell realm.

1486
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:55,240
And it's, again, more of the same stuff.

1487
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:58,440
You have, instead, though, you have your main character

1488
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:00,400
who was like the strongest devil in hell,

1489
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:01,320
and then he got amnesia.

1490
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:02,760
Oops.

1491
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:05,160
And so, you know, it has,

1492
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:07,420
the story actually revolves around that.

1493
00:59:07,420 --> 00:59:08,880
Then there was Black Matrix Zero,

1494
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:12,240
which is actually listed as Zero Zero.

1495
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:15,020
They came out on May 13th, 2004 on the PlayStation.

1496
00:59:15,020 --> 00:59:18,360
And again, like all the other ones,

1497
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:20,200
it was only out in Japan.

1498
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:23,560
And it's a prequel to the other Black Matrix games.

1499
00:59:25,540 --> 00:59:27,560
And that's pretty much it.

1500
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:30,100
You really cannot get them in English

1501
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:33,640
unless someone has managed to do some kind of patch.

1502
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:38,600
And they're really fucked up games.

1503
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:41,160
Also, they have great music.

1504
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:43,760
I do have to say that, like, that one right there.

1505
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:47,120
That's the, that's Zero Zero, isn't it?

1506
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:50,880
Yeah, this is First Battle.

1507
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:53,000
It's got great music.

1508
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,680
It's one thing I did like about these games

1509
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:56,720
is it had fantastic music.

1510
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:59,280
But it's just the themes are really, really dark.

1511
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:02,760
Brightman in chat wants to know who made this game.

1512
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:03,740
Cheech or Chong?

1513
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:07,120
That wasn't funny.

1514
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:10,600
It actually came out by Flight Plan.

1515
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:12,720
And it was published by Inter Channel

1516
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:16,080
in case anyone actually was curious for a real reason.

1517
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:20,640
One of the titles actually did get considered

1518
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:23,840
for a North American release.

1519
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:28,240
However, because of the religious themes in it,

1520
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:32,280
I would actually have to say pretty sacrilegious things

1521
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:35,160
in it, it got the boot.

1522
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:37,280
I think we were supposed to get-

1523
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:39,520
Could they have just changed the art or something?

1524
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:41,240
And I don't know.

1525
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:43,760
Isn't there other ways they can kind of get around it?

1526
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:45,000
They can release anime with that.

1527
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,760
They should be able to release a video game with that.

1528
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:49,880
The Flight Matrix just had a pretty interesting story.

1529
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:52,640
And yeah, but the first one was really, in my opinion,

1530
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:54,240
the best, because you have to work

1531
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:56,080
for your dominatrix mistress.

1532
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:57,960
And you choose your mistress, by the way,

1533
01:00:57,960 --> 01:00:59,400
at the beginning of the game.

1534
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:01,440
Sexy.

1535
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:03,600
Yeah, so that's it.

1536
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:05,960
All right, there it is, your classic game of the week.

1537
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:09,480
Black Matrix, that's black slash matrix.

1538
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:12,440
And good luck finding that one to play.

1539
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:14,040
I have a friend who's got the Saturn version.

1540
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:16,480
But think about it, you'll learn Japanese while you play,

1541
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:18,240
because it's not in English at all.

1542
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:19,460
So good luck with that.

1543
01:01:19,460 --> 01:01:22,440
All right, but a good trip down memory lane nonetheless,

1544
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:24,720
on a one that I'm sure most people listening

1545
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:27,040
probably have never heard of, so there you go.

1546
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:28,040
All right, anyhow, that's gonna do it

1547
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:29,240
for the first half of our show tonight.

1548
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:31,520
Don't go anywhere, guys, we still have plenty to go here

1549
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:33,000
tonight on Orange Lounge Radio.

1550
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,480
Some rapid fire news when we get back.

1551
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:35,600
We gotta talk about what happened

1552
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:37,400
on Blizzard's call this week.

1553
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:39,320
Some really interesting updates on Diablo 3,

1554
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:40,880
as well as World of Warcraft.

1555
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:43,780
Another lawsuit involving Band Hero.

1556
01:01:43,780 --> 01:01:47,280
And you're never gonna believe this story about Skyrim.

1557
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:49,440
It actually has nothing to do with the game.

1558
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:50,280
Just wait for it.

1559
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:51,720
We'll talk about all that when we come back

1560
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:55,160
with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1561
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:59,320
["Orange Lounge Radio Theme Song"]

1562
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:03,920
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

1563
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:06,320
We are live on this Sunday evening,

1564
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:11,040
August the 7th, if I lose my calendar right, of 2011,

1565
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:15,320
where we're taping the 423rd episode of our show.

1566
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:17,080
I'm starting to lose count, oh my gosh.

1567
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:18,280
Anyhow, we're gonna get back

1568
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:20,560
into some rapid fire news tonight,

1569
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:22,280
and do some quick stories for you guys.

1570
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:23,880
Luke, you start us off.

1571
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:26,940
All right, so let's see, starting things off,

1572
01:02:26,940 --> 01:02:28,920
let's talk a little bit about Borderlands 2,

1573
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:31,440
which I'm very excited that got announced.

1574
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:34,900
That'll be coming out sometime after March 2012.

1575
01:02:34,900 --> 01:02:39,900
It's gonna be the next fiscal year for Take Two.

1576
01:02:39,900 --> 01:02:43,600
And it's pretty awesome.

1577
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:47,240
They had a little bit of a tease in the new Game Informer.

1578
01:02:47,240 --> 01:02:49,600
Some of the details, I've kind of bleeped out about it

1579
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:52,000
so far, one of the new playable characters

1580
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,960
is gonna be Salvador the Dwarf, he is what they call

1581
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:58,000
a Gunzerker, basically a guy that's able

1582
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,780
to dual wield weapons, which is pretty cool.

1583
01:03:00,780 --> 01:03:03,440
And of course they're saying that there's gonna be

1584
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:08,440
better AI, as well as the old NPC character,

1585
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:11,280
or the old characters from the first game

1586
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:13,520
are gonna be NPC characters in this new game.

1587
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:18,600
Yeah, it looks awesome, I can't wait to check it out.

1588
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:23,400
The first game was just amazing.

1589
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:27,460
Of course, DC Universe Online is doing pretty well.

1590
01:03:27,460 --> 01:03:30,800
Right now they're going to be merging some servers

1591
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:34,700
into mega servers, and this is gonna be happening on Monday.

1592
01:03:35,660 --> 01:03:37,540
That doesn't strike me as news you hear

1593
01:03:37,540 --> 01:03:39,180
when a game's doing well.

1594
01:03:39,180 --> 01:03:41,480
Well, whatever, well is the subjective term.

1595
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:42,420
I guess so.

1596
01:03:42,420 --> 01:03:47,420
Apparently they're previously held as super servers.

1597
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:50,900
Mega servers will give the player's ability

1598
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:55,640
to switch between PVP and PVE styles of gameplay.

1599
01:03:55,640 --> 01:04:00,640
And, I don't know, I guess before it was maybe.

1600
01:04:02,180 --> 01:04:04,180
Oh hey, apparently we're playing Listis tonight,

1601
01:04:04,180 --> 01:04:05,980
except we're not, sorry about that.

1602
01:04:05,980 --> 01:04:08,580
I think maybe before they were, you had to switch

1603
01:04:08,580 --> 01:04:10,780
actual servers, you had to have a player on each server

1604
01:04:10,780 --> 01:04:12,980
in order to do that, I'm not sure.

1605
01:04:12,980 --> 01:04:16,500
But right now the servers are set to be merged

1606
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:20,040
into four mega servers, one PC, one PS3 server

1607
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:25,040
for the US with twin servers in the European regions.

1608
01:04:25,220 --> 01:04:27,780
So wow, that's interesting.

1609
01:04:27,780 --> 01:04:30,380
So I guess if you're playing in the US,

1610
01:04:30,380 --> 01:04:32,420
you'll be playing with everybody in the US.

1611
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:35,460
All five other people that are playing

1612
01:04:35,460 --> 01:04:37,100
DC Universe right now.

1613
01:04:37,100 --> 01:04:37,940
Yeah.

1614
01:04:37,940 --> 01:04:39,980
I'm just mad, DC Universe players

1615
01:04:39,980 --> 01:04:41,420
are gonna write angry emails to the show.

1616
01:04:41,420 --> 01:04:43,700
I'm not, I'm only being half serious.

1617
01:04:43,700 --> 01:04:47,060
I mean, I don't know many people at all

1618
01:04:47,060 --> 01:04:49,100
that are playing it, but obviously some people are.

1619
01:04:49,100 --> 01:04:50,580
I don't know anyone that plays EverQuest either,

1620
01:04:50,580 --> 01:04:51,980
but that game's still going.

1621
01:04:53,420 --> 01:04:56,180
Although, the way things are right now though

1622
01:04:56,180 --> 01:04:58,740
with all the server merges, some players

1623
01:04:58,740 --> 01:05:01,720
will be forced to change their names after the merge,

1624
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:03,500
since two characters cannot exist

1625
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:05,400
with the same name on the same server.

1626
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:10,400
So now you'll have to be xxxseparath69xxx, yeah.

1627
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:19,600
And then finally, the first jailbreak,

1628
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:22,700
or PS3 jailbreak raid in South Africa

1629
01:05:22,700 --> 01:05:24,220
has one man arrested.

1630
01:05:25,660 --> 01:05:28,460
Didn't even know they were still going after people there.

1631
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:32,940
So apparently they raided this guy in Park Town

1632
01:05:32,940 --> 01:05:37,280
and confiscated $14,000 worth of computers,

1633
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:41,160
PS3s, hard drives, jailbreak software, USB kits,

1634
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:45,160
and fake PS2 games and original PS3 games.

1635
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,560
And they said one man was taken into custody

1636
01:05:48,560 --> 01:05:52,700
at the Special Commercial Crimes Court, but made bail.

1637
01:05:54,980 --> 01:05:57,720
What exactly is the crime that these folks are committing?

1638
01:05:57,720 --> 01:05:59,160
Jailbreaking the PS3?

1639
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:01,380
Yeah, jailbreaking the PS3.

1640
01:06:01,380 --> 01:06:04,640
Which really shouldn't be a crime in the first place.

1641
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:06,360
I guess it's a different country,

1642
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:09,040
but I thought when it came at least to this country,

1643
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:10,380
they found in a court of law

1644
01:06:10,380 --> 01:06:11,880
that you can jailbreak your phone.

1645
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:12,720
Your iPhone.

1646
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:14,540
Well your phone, yeah, because that's added

1647
01:06:14,540 --> 01:06:17,800
to a list of devices that it's okay and legal

1648
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:20,400
to do that with, however the PlayStation 3

1649
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:22,240
is not one of those devices.

1650
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:25,880
Now they were hoping the whole GeoHats thing

1651
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:28,480
that it would actually go to trial

1652
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:30,800
and he would be found innocent,

1653
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:32,280
which case would set a precedent

1654
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:34,880
that it's okay to jailbreak that stuff.

1655
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:38,900
Of course, him being a pussy also backed out of everything

1656
01:06:38,900 --> 01:06:41,020
and they settled out of court

1657
01:06:41,020 --> 01:06:43,320
so he can get his job at Sony or whatever.

1658
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:47,100
And so there's no precedent set there.

1659
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:51,040
I don't think he works at Sony actually.

1660
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:52,320
Yeah, he works at Facebook,

1661
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:53,960
but who cares, he's still pussy.

1662
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:57,360
But you're not mad, not at all.

1663
01:06:57,360 --> 01:06:58,360
Oh, I don't care.

1664
01:06:58,360 --> 01:07:00,320
All right, there's no reason for me

1665
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:02,280
to jailbreak my PS3.

1666
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:03,640
Don't play enough games on it.

1667
01:07:03,640 --> 01:07:05,080
All right, let me do some quick stories here.

1668
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:06,960
One of them has to do with that 3D TV.

1669
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:09,520
Remember this announcement at E3 from Sony?

1670
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:10,400
Turned a lot of heads.

1671
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:12,840
They were gonna be selling a 3D TV

1672
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:16,000
that came with the TV, obviously it was like a monitor,

1673
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:20,060
glasses, an HDMI cable, and a copy of Resistance 3

1674
01:07:20,060 --> 01:07:22,680
and it was all gonna be $499, right?

1675
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:24,480
Well, it's not really gonna come

1676
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:26,760
with Resistance 3 anymore.

1677
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:28,240
That's changed a little bit.

1678
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:30,040
So they've decided now it's going to be

1679
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:33,640
MotorStorm Apocalypse instead of Resistance 3.

1680
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:37,480
Perhaps they want folks to buy the game separately.

1681
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:39,080
Maybe they don't wanna be giving it away.

1682
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:41,200
Perhaps that MotorStorm Apocalypse didn't sell

1683
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:42,880
as well as they had planned and they are sitting

1684
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:45,120
on a ton of them and they need to get rid of them.

1685
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:48,000
You also get a free copy of E.T. for the Atari 2600.

1686
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,060
Go figure.

1687
01:07:49,060 --> 01:07:50,480
They're just throwing that in there for free.

1688
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:52,160
I don't know how Sony got ahold of them.

1689
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:53,000
I guess they moved their corporate offices to New Mexico.

1690
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,400
No, don't get me wrong.

1691
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:57,400
In MotorStorm Apocalypse, it's sad that it didn't sell

1692
01:07:57,400 --> 01:07:59,280
as well as they had hoped.

1693
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:00,240
It's a great game.

1694
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:04,000
It's just, you know, I think people were hoping

1695
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,240
to get Resistance 3.

1696
01:08:05,240 --> 01:08:08,080
Although, I'm not sure if it made our show roll,

1697
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:11,040
but if you pre-order through GameStop,

1698
01:08:11,040 --> 01:08:14,520
you still do get Resistance 3 and MotorStorm Apocalypse.

1699
01:08:15,560 --> 01:08:17,560
But that would require pre-ordering through GameStop.

1700
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:18,400
Yes. And I hate them so much.

1701
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:21,180
Why would you pre-order a TV through GameStop?

1702
01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:22,020
Don't do that.

1703
01:08:22,020 --> 01:08:23,840
Do not be tempted by this.

1704
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:25,040
Amazon will match it.

1705
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:26,800
Somebody will match it.

1706
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:27,640
Just wait.

1707
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:30,880
Anyhow, let's see.

1708
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:33,960
Apparently, there was a statement made to GameSpot

1709
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:36,720
that, not GameStop, but GameSpot.

1710
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:41,000
I want to start a website called GamePots,

1711
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:44,720
because apparently there's this every way,

1712
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:46,720
which way you can rearrange that word.

1713
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:49,120
MotorStorm Apocalypse, it will have the full screen,

1714
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:51,240
but split screen functionality.

1715
01:08:51,240 --> 01:08:53,280
Remember that whole, you know, 3D,

1716
01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:55,080
but one person will see one screen

1717
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:56,320
and one will see the other. Yeah, I played that.

1718
01:08:56,320 --> 01:08:58,320
That's going to be in MotorStorm Apocalypse.

1719
01:08:58,320 --> 01:09:02,080
Yeah, I played with MLB 11, the show,

1720
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:03,960
which I really didn't want to play MLB.

1721
01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:06,080
See, they had a demonstration during our little

1722
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:07,040
Game of Summit thing.

1723
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:09,400
I wanted to play MotorStorm.

1724
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:14,180
But no, the two guys working the booth decided,

1725
01:09:14,180 --> 01:09:16,220
hey, we're a fan of baseball.

1726
01:09:16,220 --> 01:09:18,280
We're going to play baseball.

1727
01:09:18,280 --> 01:09:20,760
You know, it's about us, not the consumer.

1728
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:23,880
So I played that, and it works.

1729
01:09:23,880 --> 01:09:27,120
Yeah, I don't know.

1730
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:28,600
All right, well, some other stories here,

1731
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:31,760
one of them about Lollipop Chainsaw.

1732
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:34,280
I love it based on the name alone.

1733
01:09:34,280 --> 01:09:36,600
It's a cheerleader versus zombie game.

1734
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:37,840
It's by Grasshopper.

1735
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:39,520
They didn't know more heroes, right?

1736
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:41,680
That tells you all you need to know right there.

1737
01:09:41,680 --> 01:09:43,960
Lollipop Chainsaw, it's going to be released

1738
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:45,560
outside of Japan in 2012.

1739
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:47,340
Warner Brothers Interactive is going to be

1740
01:09:47,340 --> 01:09:48,180
the ones publishing it.

1741
01:09:48,180 --> 01:09:49,840
That was announced this week.

1742
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:53,320
There's also a partnership now with Kadokawa Games

1743
01:09:53,320 --> 01:09:55,700
that Warner Brothers will have moving forwards.

1744
01:09:55,700 --> 01:09:58,280
So more cheerleaders fighting more zombies.

1745
01:09:58,280 --> 01:10:00,280
Hooray.

1746
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:02,640
Hopefully they'll put money into the marketing

1747
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:04,600
and the game will sell.

1748
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:07,800
Also, one other interesting acquisition this week,

1749
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:11,960
Square Enix has got the rights to True Crime Hong Kong.

1750
01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:13,960
They got the rights from Activision.

1751
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:16,600
You might remember that Activision canceled this game

1752
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:18,560
some time ago, True Crime Hong Kong.

1753
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:21,560
And Square Enix, they said, quote,

1754
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:23,520
when we first saw and got our hands on the game,

1755
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:25,080
we fell in love with it.

1756
01:10:25,080 --> 01:10:27,680
That quote from Square Enix London Studios

1757
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:29,600
general manager, Lee Singleton.

1758
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:31,880
It's a great big bucket of fun.

1759
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:33,960
I think it's a good idea that they picked it up.

1760
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:36,000
I don't know why Activision got rid of it.

1761
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:39,760
But whatever.

1762
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:42,640
Now you might be wondering, Square Enix and True Crime?

1763
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:43,480
What the heck?

1764
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:45,000
Does that mean Cloud is coming to the game?

1765
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:45,840
No, no, no, no, no.

1766
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:48,520
Don't forget Square Enix now includes Eidos

1767
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:51,300
and this would not be out of the realm of possibility

1768
01:10:51,300 --> 01:10:54,600
for that group that brought what, Deus Ex

1769
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:55,680
and some of those other games

1770
01:10:55,680 --> 01:10:58,200
that now fall under the Square Enix banner.

1771
01:10:58,200 --> 01:10:59,240
There you go.

1772
01:10:59,240 --> 01:11:00,540
Dark Sakura.

1773
01:11:00,540 --> 01:11:01,860
We have some other stuff.

1774
01:11:02,940 --> 01:11:07,940
Just Dance 3 is getting a Just Create mode

1775
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:11,400
that lets players record their own choreography

1776
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:14,480
and challenge online and offline players to fit it.

1777
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:17,160
But it's just practice right now.

1778
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:19,480
There's a trailer out for it.

1779
01:11:19,480 --> 01:11:22,000
I'm ambivalent, of course.

1780
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:26,100
And then we have very sad news.

1781
01:11:26,100 --> 01:11:30,440
This makes me sniffle because the CEO

1782
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:35,440
and founder of Game Arts, Takeshi Miyagi,

1783
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:39,560
actually died on July 29th.

1784
01:11:39,560 --> 01:11:42,920
And I've reviewed a number of games

1785
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:44,880
that have come out of Game Arts,

1786
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:49,880
including Grandia, Silfied, Lunar, and very sad.

1787
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:53,280
He will be succeeded by Ryu Okuriyama,

1788
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:55,680
who is a CEO of Gaia Holdings.

1789
01:11:56,900 --> 01:12:00,220
And last little bit for rapid fire

1790
01:12:00,220 --> 01:12:02,480
is there are pre-order skins available

1791
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:05,580
for the new Batman Arkham City game

1792
01:12:05,580 --> 01:12:09,540
that are gonna be related to wherever you happen

1793
01:12:09,540 --> 01:12:12,600
to pre-order them from and there will be download content.

1794
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:14,120
It's not, it hasn't said yet though

1795
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:16,640
these are gonna be available to everybody,

1796
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:18,640
maybe through a purchase or whatever.

1797
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:20,200
But the different ones that they have

1798
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:23,720
is that you can have the 1970s Batman skin,

1799
01:12:23,720 --> 01:12:28,720
which is through shop2.net and Toys R Us.

1800
01:12:29,680 --> 01:12:32,040
Shop2.net by the way is UK retailer.

1801
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:34,600
You can get the Batman Beyond skin

1802
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:39,440
through gamestop.co.uk or mightyape.co.nz.

1803
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:41,760
That's New Zealand or UK.

1804
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:45,340
You also get the Dark Knight Returns skin,

1805
01:12:45,340 --> 01:12:48,220
which will be if you buy it at any store,

1806
01:12:48,220 --> 01:12:50,660
if you buy the collector's edition at any store.

1807
01:12:50,660 --> 01:12:52,380
There's the animated series version

1808
01:12:52,380 --> 01:12:54,500
that is if you get it from Mighty Apes,

1809
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:56,640
that's again New Zealand.

1810
01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:59,580
There's Earth One Batman, which is again through Mighty Ape.

1811
01:12:59,580 --> 01:13:02,580
And then there is the Robin Batman,

1812
01:13:02,580 --> 01:13:06,100
which is available through Best Buy or gamesmania.be,

1813
01:13:06,100 --> 01:13:09,660
which is Holland or JB Hi-Fi for Australia.

1814
01:13:09,660 --> 01:13:11,500
I want the Adam West Batman.

1815
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:12,340
It's there.

1816
01:13:12,340 --> 01:13:13,160
It looks pretty cool.

1817
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:14,000
I know.

1818
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:14,840
Where do I get that in-

1819
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:15,900
I'll leave the picture to the chat room.

1820
01:13:15,900 --> 01:13:18,260
Yeah, but where do I get that in America?

1821
01:13:18,260 --> 01:13:19,100
Pre-ordering that from.

1822
01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:21,860
That one is Toys R Us.

1823
01:13:21,860 --> 01:13:23,100
Okay, I can do that.

1824
01:13:23,100 --> 01:13:24,600
Like I said, the 1970s Batman.

1825
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:26,180
I don't have burning hatred for Toys R Us,

1826
01:13:26,180 --> 01:13:27,020
so that'll work.

1827
01:13:28,580 --> 01:13:29,420
Besides-

1828
01:13:29,420 --> 01:13:30,260
It's actually more like the comic-

1829
01:13:30,260 --> 01:13:31,780
I can go be a Toys R Us kid.

1830
01:13:31,780 --> 01:13:34,460
It's more like the 1970s comic version,

1831
01:13:34,460 --> 01:13:36,460
but that was the same as the Adam West one.

1832
01:13:36,460 --> 01:13:38,060
Yeah, it's Adam West Batman to me.

1833
01:13:38,060 --> 01:13:39,180
That's the one I wanna play.

1834
01:13:39,180 --> 01:13:41,460
Except you know he doesn't have the drawn on eyebrows.

1835
01:13:41,460 --> 01:13:42,820
That or animated series.

1836
01:13:42,820 --> 01:13:44,460
I like the animated series one too.

1837
01:13:44,460 --> 01:13:45,280
It's pretty cool.

1838
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:46,120
That's in there.

1839
01:13:46,120 --> 01:13:48,700
I gotta say that Michael Keaton one's kinda awesome too.

1840
01:13:48,700 --> 01:13:49,520
That one way on the right.

1841
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:50,420
Is that Michael Keaton Batman?

1842
01:13:50,420 --> 01:13:52,380
The one on the far right is actually,

1843
01:13:52,380 --> 01:13:54,340
I do believe the Robin Batman.

1844
01:13:54,340 --> 01:13:56,100
No, that's on the far left, isn't it?

1845
01:13:56,100 --> 01:13:57,340
No, that's Batman Beyond.

1846
01:13:57,340 --> 01:13:58,420
Oh.

1847
01:13:58,420 --> 01:14:00,300
So in order on this one,

1848
01:14:00,300 --> 01:14:01,180
let me see if I get it right.

1849
01:14:01,180 --> 01:14:02,800
You have from left to right.

1850
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:04,460
You have the Batman Beyond one.

1851
01:14:04,460 --> 01:14:08,940
You have the Dark Knight Returns.

1852
01:14:08,940 --> 01:14:12,540
You have Earth One 1970s animated series

1853
01:14:12,540 --> 01:14:14,000
and Robin's Batman.

1854
01:14:15,220 --> 01:14:16,540
Just keep in mind Dick Grayson

1855
01:14:16,540 --> 01:14:17,820
took over as Batman for a while.

1856
01:14:17,820 --> 01:14:19,220
You know who they have,

1857
01:14:19,220 --> 01:14:21,980
or know who one of the characters is gonna be

1858
01:14:21,980 --> 01:14:24,120
that they haven't announced yet, right?

1859
01:14:24,120 --> 01:14:27,520
Nightwing actually is gonna be one of the characters.

1860
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:28,460
Which is awesome.

1861
01:14:28,460 --> 01:14:30,300
Shaping up to be more and more awesome.

1862
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:32,580
Well then let me see something real quick.

1863
01:14:32,580 --> 01:14:34,000
Well I just wanna say quickly in our chat room,

1864
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,820
Brakeman in the chat room at chat.orangelaunchy.com says,

1865
01:14:36,820 --> 01:14:39,320
can I get George Clooney Nipple Batman?

1866
01:14:39,320 --> 01:14:41,220
Actually I was incorrect.

1867
01:14:41,220 --> 01:14:43,640
Robin gets the Red Robin skin.

1868
01:14:43,640 --> 01:14:44,700
I was incorrect.

1869
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:47,420
It's not, the picture of it's not available.

1870
01:14:47,420 --> 01:14:51,700
Red Robin as in the mascot for wonderful Burger Chain?

1871
01:14:51,700 --> 01:14:52,540
No.

1872
01:14:52,540 --> 01:14:53,700
Because that would be hilarious.

1873
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:57,620
That's almost as cool as fighting as the Burger King.

1874
01:14:58,660 --> 01:14:59,780
I'm finding a picture.

1875
01:15:00,680 --> 01:15:01,940
There was a video that someone did,

1876
01:15:01,940 --> 01:15:04,300
a mock him of.

1877
01:15:04,300 --> 01:15:07,100
It was like the Burger King,

1878
01:15:07,100 --> 01:15:08,540
I don't even know what the fuck it was.

1879
01:15:08,540 --> 01:15:10,820
Somehow someone made the Burger King even creepier

1880
01:15:10,820 --> 01:15:12,980
and he was in oblivion.

1881
01:15:12,980 --> 01:15:14,300
Okay there's a picture in the chat room

1882
01:15:14,300 --> 01:15:16,780
of what Red Robin looks like from the comics.

1883
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:19,760
You know I don't know if I could support

1884
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:21,700
George Clooney Nipple Batman being in the game

1885
01:15:21,700 --> 01:15:23,980
because that means that Mr. Freeze might show up

1886
01:15:23,980 --> 01:15:26,020
and it might be really bad.

1887
01:15:26,020 --> 01:15:27,820
Allow me to break the ice.

1888
01:15:27,820 --> 01:15:31,900
Cold, freeze, cold, freeze, cold.

1889
01:15:31,900 --> 01:15:34,620
Frozen ice, cold gel.

1890
01:15:34,620 --> 01:15:36,900
Killing winter ice, winter ice.

1891
01:15:36,900 --> 01:15:38,820
Chill, cold ice, shut up.

1892
01:15:38,820 --> 01:15:40,740
Cold, freeze, chill, freeze.

1893
01:15:40,740 --> 01:15:42,700
Winter ice, cold, cold ice.

1894
01:15:42,700 --> 01:15:44,580
Crosswind ice, freezing ice.

1895
01:15:44,580 --> 01:15:47,820
Cool, freeze, freeze, freeze, freeze.

1896
01:15:47,820 --> 01:15:50,700
Freeze, freeze, freeze, freeze.

1897
01:15:50,700 --> 01:15:53,620
Let's kick some ice.

1898
01:15:54,460 --> 01:15:55,980
That's the former governor of California

1899
01:15:55,980 --> 01:15:57,020
ladies and gentlemen.

1900
01:15:57,020 --> 01:16:02,020
I love that shit.

1901
01:16:04,420 --> 01:16:08,100
Okay I put in another picture of Batman versus Red Robin.

1902
01:16:08,100 --> 01:16:10,300
It's not quite showgirls bad though.

1903
01:16:10,300 --> 01:16:11,540
That's the problem.

1904
01:16:11,540 --> 01:16:13,860
Showgirls bad is so bad it's kind of good.

1905
01:16:13,860 --> 01:16:15,880
But that's just bad.

1906
01:16:17,700 --> 01:16:18,820
It's just awesome.

1907
01:16:20,940 --> 01:16:23,360
All right some quick plugs.

1908
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:26,060
Check out one of our other shows we produce.

1909
01:16:26,060 --> 01:16:28,540
The Best Little Hoard House in Azeroth.

1910
01:16:28,540 --> 01:16:30,620
www.hoardhouse.com.

1911
01:16:30,620 --> 01:16:31,900
It's all things World of Warcraft.

1912
01:16:31,900 --> 01:16:33,340
Which funny enough we're actually getting

1913
01:16:33,340 --> 01:16:35,100
into a couple blizzard stories coming up here.

1914
01:16:35,100 --> 01:16:37,980
But there are things that go beyond just wow

1915
01:16:37,980 --> 01:16:39,580
and possibly affecting some other games too.

1916
01:16:39,580 --> 01:16:41,800
So a little bit of crossover tonight going on.

1917
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:44,660
I do want to remind folks too that we are still recruiting

1918
01:16:44,660 --> 01:16:47,600
indie games to spotlight on the show.

1919
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:48,760
We're gonna have a new segment.

1920
01:16:48,760 --> 01:16:52,600
I don't think it'll debut next week but maybe in two weeks.

1921
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:54,540
We're gonna have a new segment dedicated to indie games

1922
01:16:54,540 --> 01:16:55,680
here on the show.

1923
01:16:55,680 --> 01:16:58,500
Very similar to kind of what we do for the classic games.

1924
01:16:58,500 --> 01:17:00,160
We're hoping to talk to some indie developers

1925
01:17:00,160 --> 01:17:02,460
and spotlight more indie games here on the show.

1926
01:17:02,460 --> 01:17:04,460
Obviously we've talked a lot about the Humble Indie Bundle

1927
01:17:04,460 --> 01:17:06,820
tonight which is a great place to start.

1928
01:17:06,820 --> 01:17:08,500
But we want to try and talk to some of the developers

1929
01:17:08,500 --> 01:17:11,740
themselves if you or anyone you know is developing

1930
01:17:11,740 --> 01:17:15,000
an indie game either for the PC, a homebrew thing,

1931
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,980
maybe for the iOS or Xbox Live independent games.

1932
01:17:17,980 --> 01:17:20,740
I know it's very hard to stand out on Xbox Live

1933
01:17:20,740 --> 01:17:21,580
that's for sure.

1934
01:17:21,580 --> 01:17:24,300
So come get some exposure on Orange Lounge Radio.

1935
01:17:24,300 --> 01:17:25,460
We don't charge for it.

1936
01:17:25,460 --> 01:17:26,860
I don't think I made that clear last week

1937
01:17:26,860 --> 01:17:29,580
but it's we'll do it because we like your game

1938
01:17:29,580 --> 01:17:31,820
not because we're getting any money off it.

1939
01:17:31,820 --> 01:17:33,540
So email us.

1940
01:17:33,540 --> 01:17:36,840
You can email the show at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com

1941
01:17:36,840 --> 01:17:38,860
or you can get into contact with us on Twitter

1942
01:17:38,860 --> 01:17:40,360
at twitter.com slash O-L-R.

1943
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:41,700
You can email me directly if you want.

1944
01:17:41,700 --> 01:17:42,900
Rob at orangeloungeradio.com

1945
01:17:42,900 --> 01:17:44,180
because I'll be producing the new segment.

1946
01:17:44,180 --> 01:17:46,740
So it'll be fun.

1947
01:17:46,740 --> 01:17:47,860
All right, moving on.

1948
01:17:47,860 --> 01:17:49,500
Let's get into some other news.

1949
01:17:49,500 --> 01:17:51,840
And I mentioned Blizzard a minute ago.

1950
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:53,660
There's some big stuff that came out of Blizzard

1951
01:17:53,660 --> 01:17:55,380
on an earnings call this week, right Loki?

1952
01:17:55,380 --> 01:17:57,760
And it's just where Blizzard goes,

1953
01:17:57,760 --> 01:18:01,300
the industry may in fact follow, correct?

1954
01:18:01,300 --> 01:18:02,140
Yeah.

1955
01:18:02,140 --> 01:18:08,260
So they announced a few things about Diablo 3.

1956
01:18:08,260 --> 01:18:11,740
First off, Diablo 3 is going to feature player

1957
01:18:11,740 --> 01:18:15,500
to player real money auction houses as well

1958
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:17,340
for virtual items.

1959
01:18:17,340 --> 01:18:22,980
So you're going to be able to play this game, find items

1960
01:18:22,980 --> 01:18:26,220
or whatever, and then sell them for real money or I think

1961
01:18:26,220 --> 01:18:28,060
in-game currency as well.

1962
01:18:28,060 --> 01:18:29,820
I think you'll be given the option either.

1963
01:18:29,820 --> 01:18:32,700
And Blizzard will take fixed fees.

1964
01:18:32,700 --> 01:18:35,020
They didn't say what it is, but they'll be nominal.

1965
01:18:35,020 --> 01:18:40,780
And out of the sale price, both when the auction goes up

1966
01:18:40,780 --> 01:18:44,620
for sale and when it's sold, and then when an item's sold,

1967
01:18:44,620 --> 01:18:47,520
players will be able to keep their money in a Battle.net

1968
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:51,540
account for spending on Blizzard products and services

1969
01:18:51,540 --> 01:18:55,620
are cashed out entirely with another percentage-based fee,

1970
01:18:55,620 --> 01:18:58,180
although not yet announced, third-party payment provider.

1971
01:19:03,180 --> 01:19:05,020
Yeah, that's interesting.

1972
01:19:05,020 --> 01:19:09,340
Then, you know, if that's not good enough,

1973
01:19:09,340 --> 01:19:13,500
Diablo 3 is going to require a permanent online connection.

1974
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:15,660
That's right.

1975
01:19:15,660 --> 01:19:18,300
You're not going to be able to play the single-player portion

1976
01:19:18,300 --> 01:19:21,820
of the game unless you are connected to Battle.net.

1977
01:19:25,140 --> 01:19:27,660
One of the things that they felt was really important

1978
01:19:27,660 --> 01:19:30,260
was that if you did play offline,

1979
01:19:30,260 --> 01:19:32,620
you start a character, you get them all the way to level 20

1980
01:19:32,620 --> 01:19:36,020
or 30 or 40 or what have you, and then at some point

1981
01:19:36,020 --> 01:19:37,660
you might decide to venture onto Battle.net.

1982
01:19:37,660 --> 01:19:40,020
But if you had to start a character from scratch,

1983
01:19:40,020 --> 01:19:42,460
because there's no way for us to guarantee no cheats were

1984
01:19:42,460 --> 01:19:45,700
involved, if we let you play on the client

1985
01:19:45,700 --> 01:19:48,820
and then take the character online.

1986
01:19:48,820 --> 01:19:51,380
So basically, their whole thing is,

1987
01:19:51,380 --> 01:19:52,780
if you're connected to Battle.net,

1988
01:19:52,780 --> 01:19:57,100
there must be no way that you can cheat at all.

1989
01:19:57,100 --> 01:20:00,420
Well, it certainly would be a lot harder, that's for sure.

1990
01:20:00,420 --> 01:20:03,900
I mean, exploits will be found in the game one way or another.

1991
01:20:03,900 --> 01:20:07,240
But this is tricky.

1992
01:20:07,240 --> 01:20:09,380
Obviously, I have to watch Blizzard very closely,

1993
01:20:09,380 --> 01:20:11,740
because I spend a lot of time playing World of Warcraft.

1994
01:20:11,740 --> 01:20:15,620
I will buy Diablo 3, because I loved Diablo 2.

1995
01:20:15,620 --> 01:20:18,180
In some ways, the reason why I like World of Warcraft so much

1996
01:20:18,180 --> 01:20:20,180
is that it almost plays more like Diablo than it

1997
01:20:20,180 --> 01:20:23,540
does the RTS Warcraft games.

1998
01:20:23,540 --> 01:20:25,900
So this is all news that definitely impacts,

1999
01:20:25,900 --> 01:20:28,980
relevant to my interests, as they say.

2000
01:20:28,980 --> 01:20:31,060
So I think a large part of what they're

2001
01:20:31,060 --> 01:20:34,500
doing with the online connectivity and the fact

2002
01:20:34,500 --> 01:20:37,660
that they say you can't cheat or whatever,

2003
01:20:37,660 --> 01:20:40,620
is that they do have huge problems in Diablo 2,

2004
01:20:40,620 --> 01:20:45,700
with folks cloning items and buying characters

2005
01:20:45,700 --> 01:20:51,300
that are made in China and so forth by shady ways,

2006
01:20:51,300 --> 01:20:54,180
getting the characters all leveled up, cheating, duping

2007
01:20:54,180 --> 01:20:56,280
is a huge thing, and hacking and so forth.

2008
01:20:56,280 --> 01:20:57,700
That game has been hacked to shit.

2009
01:20:57,700 --> 01:20:59,700
And it makes a lot of people not want to play online,

2010
01:20:59,700 --> 01:21:01,780
because the experience is just screwed up.

2011
01:21:01,780 --> 01:21:04,500
Think about, if that becomes a problem,

2012
01:21:04,500 --> 01:21:07,500
it's going to screw up their entire game, because yeah,

2013
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:09,420
OK, we're assuming that, or they're

2014
01:21:09,420 --> 01:21:11,800
making the assumption that if it's connected to the battle

2015
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:17,740
now all the time, that's going to eliminate cheating.

2016
01:21:17,740 --> 01:21:19,280
I don't think that's possible.

2017
01:21:19,280 --> 01:21:20,660
I don't think it's going to eliminate cheating,

2018
01:21:20,660 --> 01:21:22,020
but it's going to cut it way, way, way, way back.

2019
01:21:22,020 --> 01:21:23,020
Well, you're going to have a problem, though,

2020
01:21:23,020 --> 01:21:24,780
with people, if they're duplicating items

2021
01:21:24,780 --> 01:21:26,980
and they're selling them for real money.

2022
01:21:26,980 --> 01:21:28,380
But they're not going to be able to duplicate items,

2023
01:21:28,380 --> 01:21:29,340
because they're always connected.

2024
01:21:29,340 --> 01:21:30,860
And the system is going to look out for that shit

2025
01:21:30,860 --> 01:21:31,780
and ban them instantly.

2026
01:21:31,780 --> 01:21:32,700
You never know.

2027
01:21:32,700 --> 01:21:36,500
The real problem is people that buy this shit.

2028
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:38,940
Like, if you buy gold for these games,

2029
01:21:38,940 --> 01:21:40,420
or you've bought one of these characters,

2030
01:21:40,420 --> 01:21:42,580
you're part of the reason this is happening.

2031
01:21:42,580 --> 01:21:44,180
And let's be real, you've probably

2032
01:21:44,180 --> 01:21:45,540
had your credit card stolen, too,

2033
01:21:45,540 --> 01:21:48,420
because a lot of those companies like to do both.

2034
01:21:48,420 --> 01:21:50,540
They sell you the info and then sell your credit card

2035
01:21:50,540 --> 01:21:52,180
information to somebody else.

2036
01:21:52,180 --> 01:21:53,900
But whatever.

2037
01:21:53,900 --> 01:21:56,940
Makes you happy, I guess.

2038
01:21:56,940 --> 01:21:57,520
I don't know.

2039
01:21:57,520 --> 01:21:59,660
And then the whole real money auction house thing

2040
01:21:59,660 --> 01:22:03,980
is just the weirdest thing I've ever heard in my life.

2041
01:22:03,980 --> 01:22:07,320
At the same time, if people weren't buying this shit

2042
01:22:07,320 --> 01:22:09,460
somewhere else, they wouldn't have

2043
01:22:09,460 --> 01:22:11,100
to do something like this, I guess.

2044
01:22:11,100 --> 01:22:13,140
I think they're just trying to get a slice of it.

2045
01:22:13,140 --> 01:22:15,780
But here's the weird thing about it for me.

2046
01:22:15,780 --> 01:22:17,220
Well, A, I'm never going to use it.

2047
01:22:17,220 --> 01:22:19,300
I will not use the real money auction house,

2048
01:22:19,300 --> 01:22:21,060
because I don't really want to support it.

2049
01:22:21,060 --> 01:22:23,100
And A, I don't want to buy this stuff on there.

2050
01:22:23,100 --> 01:22:24,380
It seems ridiculous.

2051
01:22:24,380 --> 01:22:26,780
And B, Blizzard's going to charge a listing fee

2052
01:22:26,780 --> 01:22:27,900
if you sell.

2053
01:22:27,900 --> 01:22:29,940
Like, part of me wonders if Blizzard isn't going

2054
01:22:29,940 --> 01:22:32,420
to profit off false dreams.

2055
01:22:32,420 --> 01:22:34,060
That they're going to profit off people

2056
01:22:34,060 --> 01:22:37,220
trying to list all these items for sale that will never sell.

2057
01:22:37,220 --> 01:22:38,540
I know a lot of people that are saying,

2058
01:22:38,540 --> 01:22:41,260
yeah, I'll sell items on there and make money.

2059
01:22:41,260 --> 01:22:44,340
I don't hear anyone say, I'll buy the items off there

2060
01:22:44,340 --> 01:22:45,180
and make money.

2061
01:22:45,180 --> 01:22:47,500
Well, here's some other things that you need to consider too.

2062
01:22:49,820 --> 01:22:53,300
This listing amount of money, or whatever they're taking,

2063
01:22:53,300 --> 01:22:56,160
I can guarantee it's not an in-game currency.

2064
01:22:57,460 --> 01:22:58,980
So that means you're going to have to have

2065
01:22:58,980 --> 01:23:00,820
your credit card in there somewhere.

2066
01:23:03,340 --> 01:23:04,180
Maybe that's not a big deal.

2067
01:23:04,180 --> 01:23:06,600
Which you already do if you play WoW anyway.

2068
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:09,260
So, you know, Battle.net probably has it already.

2069
01:23:09,260 --> 01:23:11,820
And a lot of people that are going to come play Diablo 3

2070
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:14,180
are probably already playing WoW.

2071
01:23:14,180 --> 01:23:16,180
So, the weird thing is, you know,

2072
01:23:16,180 --> 01:23:18,400
I know Blizzard has swore up and down

2073
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:20,400
they have their legal asses covered.

2074
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:21,780
So whatever, that's fine.

2075
01:23:21,780 --> 01:23:25,100
But it strikes me as very odd

2076
01:23:25,100 --> 01:23:26,640
that let's say, hypothetically,

2077
01:23:26,640 --> 01:23:29,500
somebody could sell enough items

2078
01:23:29,500 --> 01:23:31,580
that they make a significant amount of money on this.

2079
01:23:31,580 --> 01:23:32,800
I don't think anybody's going to make more

2080
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:34,260
than maybe 20 bucks on this stuff.

2081
01:23:34,260 --> 01:23:37,540
But let's say somebody does make a fair amount of money

2082
01:23:37,540 --> 01:23:38,740
off some of these items.

2083
01:23:39,700 --> 01:23:42,700
Wouldn't they have to claim taxes on that at some point?

2084
01:23:42,700 --> 01:23:44,660
Like, wouldn't forms have to be filed by Blizzard,

2085
01:23:44,660 --> 01:23:46,220
or I guess whoever their third party is,

2086
01:23:46,220 --> 01:23:47,980
that they're going to get involved on some of that?

2087
01:23:47,980 --> 01:23:49,740
Can you be taxed on not real items?

2088
01:23:49,740 --> 01:23:52,940
And then that's where the whole internet gambling thing

2089
01:23:52,940 --> 01:23:56,140
comes into play is that there's no fine,

2090
01:23:56,140 --> 01:24:00,980
I mean, Blizzard controls the drop rate of these items

2091
01:24:00,980 --> 01:24:02,220
that they're then going to turn around

2092
01:24:02,220 --> 01:24:03,320
and charge you to sell.

2093
01:24:03,320 --> 01:24:07,540
Something about that seems really devious to me.

2094
01:24:07,540 --> 01:24:12,060
Like, there's not a check and balance to that.

2095
01:24:12,060 --> 01:24:13,380
Like, Blizzard is going to control-

2096
01:24:13,380 --> 01:24:14,540
It's insider trading.

2097
01:24:14,540 --> 01:24:16,900
Yeah, that's what it is, it's insider trading.

2098
01:24:16,900 --> 01:24:18,840
Like, that's legal?

2099
01:24:19,740 --> 01:24:21,580
Okay, I think it's only legal

2100
01:24:21,580 --> 01:24:23,060
because it hasn't really been done yet.

2101
01:24:23,060 --> 01:24:26,420
But I think this is going to catch somebody's eye.

2102
01:24:26,420 --> 01:24:28,320
This is going to catch the eye of a Leland Yee

2103
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:31,580
or somebody out there that's wanting, you know,

2104
01:24:31,580 --> 01:24:33,300
the same way online gambling did.

2105
01:24:33,300 --> 01:24:34,140
They're just-

2106
01:24:34,140 --> 01:24:36,180
It just doesn't add up to me.

2107
01:24:38,540 --> 01:24:39,500
SHA100Matt says,

2108
01:24:39,500 --> 01:24:41,700
"'Rob, this is the same company that got a ton of suckers

2109
01:24:41,700 --> 01:24:43,460
"'to pay $20 for a dumb mount on.'"

2110
01:24:43,460 --> 01:24:44,900
Wow, true.

2111
01:24:44,900 --> 01:24:45,740
Very true.

2112
01:24:46,660 --> 01:24:48,220
I never bought the dumb mount, just so you know.

2113
01:24:48,220 --> 01:24:50,140
The only thing I ever bought were the charity pets.

2114
01:24:50,140 --> 01:24:51,940
They were charity, just so you know.

2115
01:24:54,380 --> 01:24:55,200
But,

2116
01:24:57,540 --> 01:25:00,220
I know some people who did buy those mounts

2117
01:25:00,220 --> 01:25:01,180
and they quite enjoy them.

2118
01:25:01,180 --> 01:25:03,540
They spend a lot of money on them.

2119
01:25:03,540 --> 01:25:05,780
And at the same time, I'm not going to tell a person

2120
01:25:05,780 --> 01:25:07,140
what they should and shouldn't spend their money on

2121
01:25:07,140 --> 01:25:09,140
to make them happy, right?

2122
01:25:09,140 --> 01:25:12,620
And if a fake little star pony that flies

2123
01:25:12,620 --> 01:25:14,220
makes you happy, then go for it.

2124
01:25:16,140 --> 01:25:18,860
I wouldn't pay for tower bucks and tiny tower either,

2125
01:25:18,860 --> 01:25:20,520
but I still play the game.

2126
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:21,360
Yeah.

2127
01:25:22,220 --> 01:25:23,660
I don't know.

2128
01:25:23,660 --> 01:25:26,420
Let's see, going into some other comments from chat,

2129
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:28,480
Dungeon Buster says,

2130
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:31,100
"'I'm surprised that they didn't opt to let players into making

2131
01:25:31,100 --> 01:25:34,380
a separate profile for off an online play.'"

2132
01:25:34,380 --> 01:25:36,540
Me too, but maybe they were worried about things like

2133
01:25:36,540 --> 01:25:41,540
blurring the lines or whatever, and leave it open to abuse.

2134
01:25:41,700 --> 01:25:43,260
Shlace's pop in chat says,

2135
01:25:43,260 --> 01:25:45,380
"'That issue has come up before with Second Life,

2136
01:25:45,380 --> 01:25:48,560
where people were making tangible income for digital goods

2137
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:51,540
on their skins, house, digital assets design

2138
01:25:51,540 --> 01:25:52,820
that they put the time into making

2139
01:25:52,820 --> 01:25:54,500
and then selling on PayPal.

2140
01:25:54,500 --> 01:25:56,580
The IRS had no idea what to do with it.'

2141
01:25:56,580 --> 01:25:58,060
But you can look up news articles about it.

2142
01:25:58,060 --> 01:26:00,660
It was a big deal when Second Life was still relevant."

2143
01:26:03,460 --> 01:26:06,580
Yeah, I'm really interested to see where this goes.

2144
01:26:06,580 --> 01:26:07,420
I don't know.

2145
01:26:07,420 --> 01:26:08,240
Well, here's my thing.

2146
01:26:08,240 --> 01:26:10,460
And this is with the whole IRS stuff.

2147
01:26:10,460 --> 01:26:14,700
If they're gonna tax you on in-game currency that you make,

2148
01:26:14,700 --> 01:26:16,300
then I should be able to pay those taxes

2149
01:26:16,300 --> 01:26:17,740
with in-game currency.

2150
01:26:17,740 --> 01:26:19,460
Because that's always been the problem.

2151
01:26:19,460 --> 01:26:21,700
They're trying to associate a value to this stuff.

2152
01:26:21,700 --> 01:26:22,820
Like say, for example,

2153
01:26:22,820 --> 01:26:27,020
I sell some items in Diablo 3

2154
01:26:27,020 --> 01:26:32,020
and earn 20,000 Blizzard space bucks

2155
01:26:32,300 --> 01:26:35,340
or whatever they're gonna be under there.

2156
01:26:35,340 --> 01:26:40,000
And then somehow that translates to $15,000

2157
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:40,840
or something like that.

2158
01:26:40,840 --> 01:26:42,500
But if I never cash that stuff out,

2159
01:26:42,500 --> 01:26:44,820
I mean, it's digital.

2160
01:26:44,820 --> 01:26:47,540
It's not really worth that kind of money.

2161
01:26:47,540 --> 01:26:50,000
But if they're gonna charge me that,

2162
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,220
then why should I have to pay in real money

2163
01:26:52,220 --> 01:26:54,340
if it's not real money that I'm earning?

2164
01:26:54,340 --> 01:26:55,860
You know what I mean?

2165
01:26:55,860 --> 01:26:56,700
Well, keep in mind there are

2166
01:26:56,700 --> 01:26:59,100
the two completely separate auction houses.

2167
01:26:59,100 --> 01:27:00,580
And there's gonna be the auction house

2168
01:27:00,580 --> 01:27:02,620
that runs completely off in-game currency.

2169
01:27:02,620 --> 01:27:03,660
I'll use that.

2170
01:27:03,660 --> 01:27:04,500
Why not?

2171
01:27:04,500 --> 01:27:06,460
I use it and wow, it's a great system.

2172
01:27:06,460 --> 01:27:07,560
I like it.

2173
01:27:07,560 --> 01:27:09,820
I don't pay real money to use it.

2174
01:27:09,820 --> 01:27:11,200
Besides, I guess one could argue

2175
01:27:11,200 --> 01:27:12,700
my monthly subscription fee.

2176
01:27:12,700 --> 01:27:14,140
And that's something we got into talking about

2177
01:27:14,140 --> 01:27:15,980
on Hoard House this week is that

2178
01:27:15,980 --> 01:27:18,580
before you cash out through this third party vendor,

2179
01:27:18,580 --> 01:27:20,820
the dollar and cents is in your Blizzard wallet

2180
01:27:20,820 --> 01:27:21,860
for lack of a better term.

2181
01:27:21,860 --> 01:27:23,700
We don't know exactly what it's called yet.

2182
01:27:23,700 --> 01:27:26,380
You could essentially pay for your monthly wow fee

2183
01:27:26,380 --> 01:27:28,340
off selling games in Diablo.

2184
01:27:28,340 --> 01:27:30,260
Because you could use the money in your Blizzard wallet

2185
01:27:30,260 --> 01:27:32,220
to buy other Blizzard services.

2186
01:27:32,220 --> 01:27:35,320
So somebody could fund their wow by playing Diablo

2187
01:27:35,320 --> 01:27:36,180
and selling the items.

2188
01:27:36,180 --> 01:27:39,500
But again, that's assuming there's a market for buyers.

2189
01:27:39,500 --> 01:27:40,740
Does anyone out there in chat

2190
01:27:40,740 --> 01:27:42,060
wanna say that they'll be using this

2191
01:27:42,060 --> 01:27:44,300
to buy items to give them an advantage?

2192
01:27:44,300 --> 01:27:46,860
Will you drop $3 to get an epic purple

2193
01:27:46,860 --> 01:27:49,240
or whatever color they are in Diablo

2194
01:27:49,240 --> 01:27:50,580
to give you an edge in the game?

2195
01:27:50,580 --> 01:27:53,260
Or are you like, fuck that, I'll earn it?

2196
01:27:53,260 --> 01:27:55,220
I bet you most people sitting in this room

2197
01:27:55,220 --> 01:27:57,200
are probably like, fuck that, I'll earn it.

2198
01:27:57,200 --> 01:27:58,040
I'm guessing.

2199
01:27:58,040 --> 01:27:58,860
I know that's where I'm coming from.

2200
01:27:58,860 --> 01:28:00,540
Fuck that, I'll cheat.

2201
01:28:00,540 --> 01:28:02,500
You can't, you have to be online all the time.

2202
01:28:02,500 --> 01:28:03,580
Oh, no, no, no, no.

2203
01:28:03,580 --> 01:28:05,420
That's why you're mad, because you can't cheat.

2204
01:28:05,420 --> 01:28:06,540
Oh, I'm not mad.

2205
01:28:06,540 --> 01:28:08,580
I just think that it's a bold statement

2206
01:28:08,580 --> 01:28:10,300
to say that you can't cheat.

2207
01:28:10,300 --> 01:28:11,940
There is no can't, okay?

2208
01:28:11,940 --> 01:28:12,980
It will happen.

2209
01:28:12,980 --> 01:28:14,260
There will be a way.

2210
01:28:16,420 --> 01:28:19,020
And then they'll be like, we ban you.

2211
01:28:19,020 --> 01:28:23,300
You banned me from Diablo.

2212
01:28:23,300 --> 01:28:25,420
RDG Singe in chat says,

2213
01:28:25,420 --> 01:28:28,040
how about playing Diablo 3 for fun?

2214
01:28:28,040 --> 01:28:30,260
Do people still do that?

2215
01:28:30,260 --> 01:28:32,260
I hope so, that's my plan.

2216
01:28:32,260 --> 01:28:35,040
I don't really want to play Diablo 3 with strangers either.

2217
01:28:35,040 --> 01:28:37,940
I'll be playing co-op with friends, and that's it.

2218
01:28:38,780 --> 01:28:40,740
Maybe, OLR people would count as friends

2219
01:28:40,740 --> 01:28:42,300
if you wanted to play Diablo 3.

2220
01:28:42,300 --> 01:28:44,700
We go on a co-op mission together.

2221
01:28:44,700 --> 01:28:46,580
But I'm still looking forward to playing the game,

2222
01:28:46,580 --> 01:28:49,660
and the online connection part doesn't really bother me

2223
01:28:49,660 --> 01:28:52,060
so much, you kind of need it for StarCraft 2.

2224
01:28:52,060 --> 01:28:54,980
I mean, I think technically you don't have to have one

2225
01:28:54,980 --> 01:28:59,420
for StarCraft 2, but the game is much more rich with one,

2226
01:28:59,420 --> 01:29:02,700
and seeing as Blizzard is very online centered

2227
01:29:02,700 --> 01:29:03,740
with their achievements and everything now,

2228
01:29:03,740 --> 01:29:06,060
this news doesn't really surprise me.

2229
01:29:06,060 --> 01:29:07,220
I don't think Blizzard,

2230
01:29:07,220 --> 01:29:09,020
Diablo isn't really something I'd want to try

2231
01:29:09,020 --> 01:29:10,340
and play on the go anyway,

2232
01:29:10,340 --> 01:29:13,080
or somewhere that I can't have an internet connection.

2233
01:29:13,080 --> 01:29:16,180
You can have internet connections on planes now, you know?

2234
01:29:16,180 --> 01:29:17,020
I don't know.

2235
01:29:17,020 --> 01:29:17,840
But I get, I-

2236
01:29:17,840 --> 01:29:19,740
Yeah, but not an internet connection to run that game.

2237
01:29:19,740 --> 01:29:22,740
But I get, I am being a little bit of a hypocrite.

2238
01:29:22,740 --> 01:29:23,580
I get it.

2239
01:29:23,580 --> 01:29:24,780
I mean, I'm admit that,

2240
01:29:24,780 --> 01:29:27,960
because I'm okay with what Blizzard's doing here,

2241
01:29:27,960 --> 01:29:30,740
but yet I'm not okay with Ubisoft doing it with Driver.

2242
01:29:30,740 --> 01:29:32,380
I think it's ridiculous.

2243
01:29:32,380 --> 01:29:36,700
But, from what I understand, the single player of Driver

2244
01:29:36,700 --> 01:29:38,740
doesn't have any online elements.

2245
01:29:38,740 --> 01:29:40,660
The single player version of this game

2246
01:29:40,660 --> 01:29:44,660
now does have a real money auction house involved,

2247
01:29:44,660 --> 01:29:46,360
where people could be making money off of it.

2248
01:29:46,360 --> 01:29:48,940
And I guess they've got to protect the environment.

2249
01:29:48,940 --> 01:29:50,600
And heaven forbid somebody does cheat,

2250
01:29:50,600 --> 01:29:52,260
and now this turns into like real money.

2251
01:29:52,260 --> 01:29:54,900
That's when it's going to be a legal problem.

2252
01:29:54,900 --> 01:29:58,540
Blizzard better hope that having everybody connected 24 seven

2253
01:29:58,540 --> 01:30:00,020
really does keep out the cheaters.

2254
01:30:00,020 --> 01:30:02,400
And they better really be watching that shit like a hawk.

2255
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:03,980
Because if somebody is able to exploit

2256
01:30:03,980 --> 01:30:06,740
that real money system, it's over.

2257
01:30:06,740 --> 01:30:07,840
You know what I mean?

2258
01:30:09,060 --> 01:30:09,900
So.

2259
01:30:11,300 --> 01:30:12,720
All right.

2260
01:30:12,720 --> 01:30:14,660
Let's move on to news that came out about the next

2261
01:30:14,660 --> 01:30:16,360
wow expansion.

2262
01:30:16,360 --> 01:30:18,780
So, Dark Soccer, I know, right?

2263
01:30:18,780 --> 01:30:21,060
You've been playing this for a while.

2264
01:30:21,060 --> 01:30:21,900
The rumor.

2265
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:26,080
I laugh every time I think about it.

2266
01:30:26,080 --> 01:30:28,600
The name apparently that has been registered

2267
01:30:28,600 --> 01:30:31,300
for the next expansion, verified by MMO Trampion

2268
01:30:31,300 --> 01:30:34,500
with trademarks and so forth, is Mists of Pandaria.

2269
01:30:34,500 --> 01:30:36,060
Mop.

2270
01:30:36,060 --> 01:30:37,980
Or the mop expansion.

2271
01:30:37,980 --> 01:30:41,680
Pandarias, of course, are named for the pandaren.

2272
01:30:41,680 --> 01:30:44,440
Living, breathing, walking, talking panda bears

2273
01:30:44,440 --> 01:30:46,180
that made their way into wow culture

2274
01:30:46,180 --> 01:30:49,540
as part of an April Fool's joke and never left.

2275
01:30:49,540 --> 01:30:51,500
Yes, you can get the pandaren monk.

2276
01:30:51,500 --> 01:30:53,560
That's one of the charity pets

2277
01:30:53,560 --> 01:30:55,060
that actually they sold there.

2278
01:30:56,020 --> 01:30:59,080
The trademark was apparently registered July 28th.

2279
01:30:59,080 --> 01:31:02,020
And it could be that this is going to be out in time

2280
01:31:02,020 --> 01:31:04,440
for Blizzcon, not the expansion itself,

2281
01:31:04,440 --> 01:31:06,740
but more news on it will come out at Blizzcon.

2282
01:31:08,220 --> 01:31:10,660
I guess that the rumors say pandarens

2283
01:31:10,660 --> 01:31:12,700
will be a playable race,

2284
01:31:12,700 --> 01:31:14,700
that you'll get to go to level 90, of course.

2285
01:31:14,700 --> 01:31:16,860
A monk hero class.

2286
01:31:16,860 --> 01:31:19,400
As you know, panda bears are all monks.

2287
01:31:19,400 --> 01:31:22,100
Well, we had some discussion on this in guild chat

2288
01:31:22,100 --> 01:31:23,120
not too long ago.

2289
01:31:25,060 --> 01:31:27,740
In fact, I believe that I, it was,

2290
01:31:27,740 --> 01:31:29,460
Miklotov was amongst the people

2291
01:31:29,460 --> 01:31:31,900
because that's who I heard about it from.

2292
01:31:31,900 --> 01:31:35,000
But we were talking about other possibilities

2293
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:39,500
that it could be like the ruins of the pandaren empire,

2294
01:31:39,500 --> 01:31:41,620
that perhaps there's only a few left

2295
01:31:41,620 --> 01:31:44,260
and you learned to become a monk from one of them.

2296
01:31:44,260 --> 01:31:46,020
Because we'd just gotten you races.

2297
01:31:47,220 --> 01:31:50,300
So it could just be that you're exploring their culture

2298
01:31:50,300 --> 01:31:53,420
like they're, who are the freaking walrus people again?

2299
01:31:53,420 --> 01:31:54,240
Kaluak.

2300
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:56,460
Yeah, I like the walrus people.

2301
01:31:56,460 --> 01:31:58,020
They're cool, they remind me of Wilford Brimley.

2302
01:31:58,020 --> 01:31:59,420
Kuch Kuch.

2303
01:31:59,420 --> 01:32:01,400
No, they all look like Wilford Brimley.

2304
01:32:01,400 --> 01:32:02,240
Anyway.

2305
01:32:03,800 --> 01:32:08,380
But I mean, it could be that you just get to visit

2306
01:32:08,380 --> 01:32:10,420
the pandarens and you learn from them.

2307
01:32:10,420 --> 01:32:12,700
So you get a monk class and maybe,

2308
01:32:12,700 --> 01:32:15,200
like you were saying level 90,

2309
01:32:15,200 --> 01:32:17,420
or, you know, we get more goody items.

2310
01:32:17,420 --> 01:32:20,480
But I mean, I would personally like to, you know,

2311
01:32:20,480 --> 01:32:24,600
have another reason to do five more levels worth of quests.

2312
01:32:26,060 --> 01:32:27,900
My favorite theory about this though,

2313
01:32:27,900 --> 01:32:30,620
is that this is just a Facebook or an IOS game.

2314
01:32:30,620 --> 01:32:31,740
It's a spinoff game.

2315
01:32:31,740 --> 01:32:33,820
God, I hope that's the case.

2316
01:32:33,820 --> 01:32:35,740
That would be much more understandable.

2317
01:32:35,740 --> 01:32:37,060
I don't know.

2318
01:32:37,060 --> 01:32:39,180
I'm okay with the whole archeology idea.

2319
01:32:39,180 --> 01:32:40,940
I call that the archeology concept,

2320
01:32:40,940 --> 01:32:43,380
that you're trying to figure out why the pandarens got,

2321
01:32:43,380 --> 01:32:44,980
you know, all murdered.

2322
01:32:44,980 --> 01:32:46,900
I just don't want to see everybody playing

2323
01:32:46,900 --> 01:32:48,060
a walking, talking panda bear,

2324
01:32:48,060 --> 01:32:48,900
cause that's getting a little ridiculous.

2325
01:32:48,900 --> 01:32:52,060
I really don't think that we're going to get them as a race,

2326
01:32:52,060 --> 01:32:56,420
because I mean, it's like every fourth expansion

2327
01:32:56,420 --> 01:32:59,580
or every even numbered expansion now has,

2328
01:32:59,580 --> 01:33:02,380
I mean, two, there's only been four versions,

2329
01:33:02,380 --> 01:33:04,580
has had a new race added.

2330
01:33:04,580 --> 01:33:07,740
It was a new area.

2331
01:33:07,740 --> 01:33:09,300
Each one's had a new area open.

2332
01:33:09,300 --> 01:33:11,660
So I think that this one's just going to be a new area

2333
01:33:11,660 --> 01:33:13,900
and a new, cause all right, let me look at it.

2334
01:33:13,900 --> 01:33:14,740
Real quick.

2335
01:33:14,740 --> 01:33:15,840
Miklotov's correcting me in chat.

2336
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:18,220
The walrus people are the Tuskar.

2337
01:33:18,220 --> 01:33:20,660
I guess the Kaluak is the faction.

2338
01:33:20,660 --> 01:33:21,780
My bad.

2339
01:33:23,580 --> 01:33:25,740
Anyway, you know, we got the first one,

2340
01:33:25,740 --> 01:33:28,080
introducing the world and everything,

2341
01:33:28,080 --> 01:33:30,380
blah, blah, blah, boring.

2342
01:33:30,380 --> 01:33:31,460
Cause it was.

2343
01:33:31,460 --> 01:33:35,020
And then you get the burning crusades.

2344
01:33:35,020 --> 01:33:37,660
You get two new races, one for each side.

2345
01:33:37,660 --> 01:33:39,960
Demons, demons, and more demons.

2346
01:33:41,860 --> 01:33:46,380
You get space goats and pretty blood elves.

2347
01:33:46,380 --> 01:33:48,980
And you're fighting demons and fire.

2348
01:33:49,920 --> 01:33:51,520
The, what was the burning Legion?

2349
01:33:51,520 --> 01:33:52,860
And you have to learn to fly.

2350
01:33:52,860 --> 01:33:53,700
Yeah.

2351
01:33:53,700 --> 01:33:55,740
The burning Legion sounds like something you have to take

2352
01:33:55,740 --> 01:33:57,420
antibiotics for.

2353
01:33:57,420 --> 01:33:58,260
It's a salve.

2354
01:33:59,260 --> 01:34:01,100
And then, okay, the next one you get basically,

2355
01:34:01,100 --> 01:34:04,300
a new character class and a new area.

2356
01:34:04,300 --> 01:34:06,720
So then when we get cataclysm,

2357
01:34:06,720 --> 01:34:10,140
it was against two new races and a new area.

2358
01:34:10,140 --> 01:34:11,500
And the whole world gets fucked up

2359
01:34:11,500 --> 01:34:13,700
and the game gets made fun.

2360
01:34:13,700 --> 01:34:16,660
So it would logically stand to reason

2361
01:34:16,660 --> 01:34:18,460
that if they're establishing a pattern,

2362
01:34:18,460 --> 01:34:22,220
then you'll be getting a new area and a new class.

2363
01:34:22,220 --> 01:34:24,280
And it could possibly be, okay,

2364
01:34:24,280 --> 01:34:26,940
what was the level cap for,

2365
01:34:28,560 --> 01:34:29,400
for a,

2366
01:34:29,400 --> 01:34:30,220
Wrath of the Lich King?

2367
01:34:30,220 --> 01:34:31,060
80.

2368
01:34:31,060 --> 01:34:31,880
Burning Crusade.

2369
01:34:31,880 --> 01:34:32,720
70.

2370
01:34:32,720 --> 01:34:33,560
70.

2371
01:34:33,560 --> 01:34:34,980
You start off with a 55 character on,

2372
01:34:34,980 --> 01:34:36,900
you know, with a level seven,

2373
01:34:36,900 --> 01:34:39,220
coming from a level 70 cap.

2374
01:34:39,220 --> 01:34:42,100
So given that the current cap right now is 85,

2375
01:34:42,100 --> 01:34:44,980
I would think that maybe monks start off as a level 70

2376
01:34:44,980 --> 01:34:45,820
or something like that.

2377
01:34:45,820 --> 01:34:46,660
Perhaps.

2378
01:34:46,660 --> 01:34:48,540
Actually, you know what else Wrath of the Lich King had?

2379
01:34:48,540 --> 01:34:51,380
It had lots and lots and tons and tons of ice.

2380
01:34:52,500 --> 01:34:54,300
Allow me to break the ice.

2381
01:34:54,300 --> 01:34:55,260
Cold.

2382
01:34:55,260 --> 01:34:56,100
Freeze.

2383
01:34:56,100 --> 01:34:56,920
Cold.

2384
01:34:56,920 --> 01:34:57,760
Freeze.

2385
01:34:57,760 --> 01:34:58,600
Cold.

2386
01:34:58,600 --> 01:34:59,700
Frozen ice.

2387
01:34:59,700 --> 01:35:01,140
Cold.

2388
01:35:01,140 --> 01:35:01,980
Killing winter.

2389
01:35:01,980 --> 01:35:02,820
I say.

2390
01:35:02,820 --> 01:35:03,660
It's actually the Lich King.

2391
01:35:05,060 --> 01:35:06,100
Talking.

2392
01:35:06,100 --> 01:35:07,420
Arthas, that bitch.

2393
01:35:10,440 --> 01:35:12,380
I'm gonna draw that, you know.

2394
01:35:12,380 --> 01:35:13,220
What?

2395
01:35:13,220 --> 01:35:14,380
Okay, when I made my death knight,

2396
01:35:14,380 --> 01:35:16,100
and I think you were there for that.

2397
01:35:16,100 --> 01:35:17,220
When I finally made a death knight

2398
01:35:17,220 --> 01:35:19,420
that was actually gonna play as a tank.

2399
01:35:19,420 --> 01:35:21,220
I just was looking,

2400
01:35:21,220 --> 01:35:22,500
cause I played a draw knight and you know,

2401
01:35:22,500 --> 01:35:24,540
they're tall and skinny.

2402
01:35:24,540 --> 01:35:25,580
Next to Arthas,

2403
01:35:25,580 --> 01:35:28,100
who's just really big and stout.

2404
01:35:28,100 --> 01:35:30,540
And I said, Arthas got to be a fat bitch.

2405
01:35:31,660 --> 01:35:33,000
And I think it was,

2406
01:35:34,820 --> 01:35:35,820
it was some,

2407
01:35:35,820 --> 01:35:37,380
of course somebody in our guild said

2408
01:35:37,380 --> 01:35:39,380
it was all those cookies.

2409
01:35:39,380 --> 01:35:40,500
But Arthas likes cookies.

2410
01:35:40,500 --> 01:35:43,380
So I was gonna draw a picture of Arthas

2411
01:35:43,380 --> 01:35:46,700
lounged out like Jabba the Hutt eating cookies.

2412
01:35:46,700 --> 01:35:49,340
Saying, let's kick some ice.

2413
01:35:49,340 --> 01:35:50,900
I should do that.

2414
01:35:50,900 --> 01:35:52,540
Anyway.

2415
01:35:52,540 --> 01:35:54,420
So Pandaria,

2416
01:35:54,420 --> 01:35:55,440
yay or nay?

2417
01:35:55,440 --> 01:35:59,000
I'm all for something new.

2418
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:00,080
I'm kinda, whatever.

2419
01:36:00,080 --> 01:36:01,320
Blizzard's gonna do what they're gonna do

2420
01:36:01,320 --> 01:36:02,480
and I can't really control it.

2421
01:36:02,480 --> 01:36:04,480
But Firelands has been kinda,

2422
01:36:04,480 --> 01:36:07,340
eh, burn, depressing.

2423
01:36:07,340 --> 01:36:10,200
Look, they can send us to,

2424
01:36:10,200 --> 01:36:11,440
you know,

2425
01:36:11,440 --> 01:36:12,720
they can send us to play with.

2426
01:36:12,720 --> 01:36:14,040
To the land of pee.

2427
01:36:14,040 --> 01:36:15,800
We can go to Keyboard Cat,

2428
01:36:15,800 --> 01:36:18,800
who lives in the land of pee, pee, pee, pee, pee.

2429
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:19,840
I don't really care.

2430
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:24,620
Like as long as it doesn't have that horribly steep curve

2431
01:36:24,620 --> 01:36:27,280
into raiding and doing all that stuff that Cataclysm did,

2432
01:36:27,280 --> 01:36:29,140
as long as it's more accessible,

2433
01:36:29,140 --> 01:36:30,520
I think as long as it just plays more like

2434
01:36:30,520 --> 01:36:33,040
Wrath of the Lich King, to be honest,

2435
01:36:33,040 --> 01:36:34,540
I think it'll be fine.

2436
01:36:34,540 --> 01:36:35,380
Well,

2437
01:36:37,480 --> 01:36:39,720
now that I'm raiding, I really like it.

2438
01:36:39,720 --> 01:36:41,760
I think that more people,

2439
01:36:41,760 --> 01:36:43,360
it should definitely, there should be,

2440
01:36:43,360 --> 01:36:46,240
maybe they'll incorporate easier raids.

2441
01:36:46,240 --> 01:36:48,020
Like, beginning raids.

2442
01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:50,100
Mikolatov in chat says,

2443
01:36:50,100 --> 01:36:55,100
I don't get all the hate for this being a possible expansion.

2444
01:37:20,740 --> 01:37:22,900
I just don't like them that much,

2445
01:37:22,900 --> 01:37:25,340
or I need them in my Warcraft, you know?

2446
01:37:25,340 --> 01:37:27,020
And maybe the Pandarens are actually

2447
01:37:27,020 --> 01:37:29,100
a magical illusion of panda bears,

2448
01:37:29,100 --> 01:37:32,100
and they really look like, not like space goats.

2449
01:37:33,940 --> 01:37:36,320
For the record, space goats are the best.

2450
01:37:36,320 --> 01:37:38,740
All right, enough wow talk.

2451
01:37:38,740 --> 01:37:39,980
Space goat.

2452
01:37:39,980 --> 01:37:41,780
I got another show for wow talk,

2453
01:37:41,780 --> 01:37:42,780
and I think we've had plenty,

2454
01:37:42,780 --> 01:37:45,400
but remember, where Blizzard goes,

2455
01:37:45,400 --> 01:37:46,900
a lot of these PC games will follow,

2456
01:37:46,900 --> 01:37:48,900
especially this whole persistent online connection.

2457
01:37:48,900 --> 01:37:50,780
I think it's gonna be really interesting

2458
01:37:50,780 --> 01:37:54,620
how people are gonna borderline forgive Blizzard, maybe.

2459
01:37:54,620 --> 01:37:56,060
I think there's definitely some people

2460
01:37:56,060 --> 01:37:57,780
hating Blizzard over this decision,

2461
01:37:57,780 --> 01:38:00,020
but there's a lot more hating Ubisoft over theirs,

2462
01:38:00,020 --> 01:38:02,160
so it's very interesting.

2463
01:38:02,160 --> 01:38:03,580
Let's move on to the email bag, though.

2464
01:38:03,580 --> 01:38:06,020
Mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com.

2465
01:38:07,300 --> 01:38:09,020
Every week you email us,

2466
01:38:09,020 --> 01:38:11,440
and we might read them here on air,

2467
01:38:11,440 --> 01:38:15,060
if Dark Soccer is feeling saucy or burpy.

2468
01:38:15,060 --> 01:38:17,060
Hey, I just have the mic up.

2469
01:38:17,060 --> 01:38:19,460
She's going to read some emails for you right now.

2470
01:38:19,460 --> 01:38:21,260
You better be nice to me, I gave you ice cream.

2471
01:38:21,260 --> 01:38:22,940
You did give me ice cream, it was delicious.

2472
01:38:22,940 --> 01:38:24,820
I found Samoa's ice cream.

2473
01:38:24,820 --> 01:38:26,900
It was really fucking good, y'all.

2474
01:38:26,900 --> 01:38:29,220
So the first email here,

2475
01:38:29,220 --> 01:38:32,000
while looking at the disused televisions in the basement,

2476
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:35,220
I was inspired to ask again, Jamie, that was to me,

2477
01:38:35,220 --> 01:38:36,260
does the vault have a collection

2478
01:38:36,260 --> 01:38:38,300
of older television sets as well?

2479
01:38:38,300 --> 01:38:39,140
No.

2480
01:38:40,460 --> 01:38:41,860
I'm sure someone has to make adapters

2481
01:38:41,860 --> 01:38:44,960
to hook up Atari 2600 or Odyssey to HDMI,

2482
01:38:44,960 --> 01:38:47,060
but do you prefer the original sets?

2483
01:38:47,060 --> 01:38:50,180
The only way I can really play the Odyssey

2484
01:38:50,180 --> 01:38:51,380
is to hook up to the original sets,

2485
01:38:51,380 --> 01:38:54,540
but all of our other systems will work with the modern TVs.

2486
01:38:55,540 --> 01:38:56,860
They make different adapters.

2487
01:38:56,860 --> 01:38:59,700
You don't have to use the little prongs to make it work.

2488
01:38:59,700 --> 01:39:02,660
I was gonna say, can't you get an RF adapter

2489
01:39:02,660 --> 01:39:05,460
at Radio Shack that will change it to RCAs?

2490
01:39:05,460 --> 01:39:07,040
Yeah, you can get an adapter.

2491
01:39:07,040 --> 01:39:08,940
Just the one problem is that I think, actually,

2492
01:39:08,940 --> 01:39:13,460
since the Odyssey was from, I wanna say, like,

2493
01:39:13,460 --> 01:39:16,260
81 or something like that,

2494
01:39:16,260 --> 01:39:20,460
it really, there's no way to make it work with a newer TV.

2495
01:39:20,460 --> 01:39:22,380
Also, I think you might expose yourself

2496
01:39:22,380 --> 01:39:25,540
to some shitty lag if you use the converters.

2497
01:39:25,540 --> 01:39:27,740
I don't really do this in my house,

2498
01:39:27,740 --> 01:39:28,580
so I couldn't tell you,

2499
01:39:28,580 --> 01:39:31,260
but I think you do open yourself up to lag issues.

2500
01:39:31,260 --> 01:39:32,600
I'll take some pictures in the vault,

2501
01:39:32,600 --> 01:39:35,580
but we actually, right now, have a couple of TVs

2502
01:39:35,580 --> 01:39:39,140
from just little small HD monitors that were

2503
01:39:39,140 --> 01:39:44,140
obtained from the destruction of a video game chain

2504
01:39:48,020 --> 01:39:49,640
that I won't talk about,

2505
01:39:51,500 --> 01:39:56,500
that they were Xbox 360 demo units.

2506
01:39:57,020 --> 01:39:58,860
We got monitors from them.

2507
01:39:58,860 --> 01:39:59,860
So that's what we have hooked up

2508
01:39:59,860 --> 01:40:01,000
with a couple of Switch boxes.

2509
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:06,000
So we have about eight systems hooked up in the other room,

2510
01:40:06,820 --> 01:40:08,780
eight or nine, something like that,

2511
01:40:08,780 --> 01:40:10,280
hooked up to these TVs.

2512
01:40:11,920 --> 01:40:14,180
I mean, really, to be honest,

2513
01:40:14,180 --> 01:40:15,980
we have two games on the Odyssey

2514
01:40:15,980 --> 01:40:18,260
that I really have an interest in playing,

2515
01:40:18,260 --> 01:40:19,960
so we don't really bother hooking it up.

2516
01:40:19,960 --> 01:40:21,020
And again, like I said,

2517
01:40:21,020 --> 01:40:23,160
we don't have anything to hook it up to.

2518
01:40:23,160 --> 01:40:24,660
All the other ones, no problem.

2519
01:40:24,660 --> 01:40:26,100
We can hook them up to just about anything,

2520
01:40:26,100 --> 01:40:28,300
although I really do think that,

2521
01:40:28,300 --> 01:40:30,440
actually, I don't think that we've tried the Atari

2522
01:40:30,440 --> 01:40:33,280
on an HDTV.

2523
01:40:33,280 --> 01:40:36,100
I think that last time we played one of our Ataris,

2524
01:40:36,100 --> 01:40:38,340
we actually did have a CRT.

2525
01:40:38,340 --> 01:40:39,340
Oh, well.

2526
01:40:39,340 --> 01:40:40,500
It's not like it's that hard

2527
01:40:40,500 --> 01:40:43,460
to go find a CRT monitor anymore.

2528
01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:46,500
I can go to the thrift store.

2529
01:40:46,500 --> 01:40:48,380
Oh, look, a TV, rabbit ears.

2530
01:40:49,540 --> 01:40:51,300
Also, I apologize for any confusion

2531
01:40:51,300 --> 01:40:52,300
about last week's email

2532
01:40:52,300 --> 01:40:54,600
regarding the voices of multiplayer games.

2533
01:40:54,600 --> 01:40:56,980
My use of the term character was somewhat misleading.

2534
01:40:56,980 --> 01:40:59,300
I meant specifically the volumes of online players

2535
01:40:59,300 --> 01:41:01,020
speaking through their player characters,

2536
01:41:01,020 --> 01:41:02,660
not those of the NPCs.

2537
01:41:02,660 --> 01:41:03,860
Thanks again, Robert M.

2538
01:41:05,840 --> 01:41:08,260
I think we did address that, though.

2539
01:41:08,260 --> 01:41:11,440
I think we were leaning towards the NPC answer,

2540
01:41:11,440 --> 01:41:14,100
but I thought I had brought up something

2541
01:41:14,100 --> 01:41:17,300
that the characters did sound further away,

2542
01:41:17,300 --> 01:41:20,320
but I can't remember, off the top of my head,

2543
01:41:20,320 --> 01:41:21,940
what it was.

2544
01:41:21,940 --> 01:41:23,540
Keep in mind, a lot of MMOs,

2545
01:41:23,540 --> 01:41:27,200
you don't really do voice chat through the MMO itself,

2546
01:41:27,200 --> 01:41:29,820
and those are actually kind of hard to find,

2547
01:41:29,820 --> 01:41:30,980
the games where that happens,

2548
01:41:30,980 --> 01:41:33,900
because yes, you have voice chat in WoW,

2549
01:41:33,900 --> 01:41:35,020
but nobody uses it.

2550
01:41:35,020 --> 01:41:37,380
I'm telling you, nobody uses it.

2551
01:41:37,380 --> 01:41:38,940
I didn't even know it was there.

2552
01:41:38,940 --> 01:41:41,340
And it's not in the public chat channels, anyway.

2553
01:41:42,740 --> 01:41:44,340
Okay, ooh, we have one from Sil.

2554
01:41:45,820 --> 01:41:46,660
Ready?

2555
01:41:47,580 --> 01:41:48,420
Yes.

2556
01:41:48,420 --> 01:41:49,700
Hi, guys, I hope all of you are doing well.

2557
01:41:49,700 --> 01:41:50,700
A few days ago, I bought

2558
01:41:50,700 --> 01:41:53,340
Vampire the Masquerade Bloodlines through Steam.

2559
01:41:53,340 --> 01:41:55,060
Of course, it didn't want to work properly,

2560
01:41:55,060 --> 01:41:58,580
and I had to download a patch through the Steam forums.

2561
01:41:58,580 --> 01:42:00,660
In a way, I thought it would have been nice

2562
01:42:00,660 --> 01:42:02,760
if Steam would just patch it themselves.

2563
01:42:02,760 --> 01:42:04,540
Then again, I'm not that technical,

2564
01:42:04,540 --> 01:42:06,220
and it might not be possible.

2565
01:42:06,220 --> 01:42:07,740
Anyhow, I started to play this game,

2566
01:42:07,740 --> 01:42:09,420
and even if it is an older game,

2567
01:42:09,420 --> 01:42:10,900
I really love the story.

2568
01:42:10,900 --> 01:42:12,680
The options where you can choose how to respond

2569
01:42:12,680 --> 01:42:15,640
and that it actually has an effect on the story of the game

2570
01:42:15,640 --> 01:42:17,380
is something that I really enjoy.

2571
01:42:17,380 --> 01:42:18,720
It makes me want to replay the game

2572
01:42:18,720 --> 01:42:21,340
and try different things just to see how the story changes.

2573
01:42:21,340 --> 01:42:22,940
Perhaps I'm also just happy to see

2574
01:42:22,940 --> 01:42:24,560
some proper blood-sucking vampires

2575
01:42:24,560 --> 01:42:27,020
instead of the woo me and my curse and stare at you

2576
01:42:27,020 --> 01:42:28,420
while you're sleeping glittery twats

2577
01:42:28,420 --> 01:42:30,580
that seem to be ruling the media now.

2578
01:42:30,580 --> 01:42:31,420
I love her.

2579
01:42:31,420 --> 01:42:35,940
For the record, the email's titled non-sparkly vampires.

2580
01:42:37,140 --> 01:42:39,700
Did you ever start playing a game

2581
01:42:39,700 --> 01:42:42,040
thinking it would be okay, but nothing mind-blowing,

2582
01:42:42,040 --> 01:42:44,380
but the more you played it, the more you loved it?

2583
01:42:44,380 --> 01:42:45,440
Guardian legend?

2584
01:42:46,460 --> 01:42:47,700
Because when you start playing that game,

2585
01:42:47,700 --> 01:42:49,300
it's like, oh, I'm shooting shit.

2586
01:42:49,300 --> 01:42:50,860
Whoa, there's an RPG!

2587
01:42:52,820 --> 01:42:55,020
I get, restate the question for me real quick.

2588
01:42:55,020 --> 01:42:56,900
Have you ever started a game

2589
01:42:56,900 --> 01:42:59,600
thinking that it would be okay, but nothing mind-blowing,

2590
01:42:59,600 --> 01:43:01,380
but the more you played it, the more you loved it?

2591
01:43:01,380 --> 01:43:02,660
Ooh.

2592
01:43:02,660 --> 01:43:04,040
Mr. Final Fantasy 13?

2593
01:43:05,460 --> 01:43:07,660
But those games, I kinda already had the bar set high.

2594
01:43:07,660 --> 01:43:08,740
I'm really trying to think of something

2595
01:43:08,740 --> 01:43:10,460
kinda outside the norm.

2596
01:43:10,460 --> 01:43:12,140
Let me think on that for a minute.

2597
01:43:13,300 --> 01:43:16,020
I'm trying to think of any others.

2598
01:43:17,560 --> 01:43:19,740
Actually, when I got back into WoW.

2599
01:43:19,740 --> 01:43:21,560
Yeah, I gotta say, World of Warcraft

2600
01:43:21,560 --> 01:43:23,380
actually kinda jumps out at me.

2601
01:43:24,300 --> 01:43:25,300
When I first played WoW,

2602
01:43:25,300 --> 01:43:26,660
I didn't think it was really all that,

2603
01:43:26,660 --> 01:43:28,180
and I didn't think I was gonna get that into it,

2604
01:43:28,180 --> 01:43:30,260
but when all my friends were playing,

2605
01:43:30,260 --> 01:43:32,180
and it became a lot more of a chat room

2606
01:43:32,180 --> 01:43:34,180
with fire spells and swords, so to speak,

2607
01:43:34,180 --> 01:43:36,000
I think that was actually a game.

2608
01:43:36,940 --> 01:43:38,620
Well, for me, when I started questing.

2609
01:43:39,620 --> 01:43:42,400
I guess you could say VVVVV that I played this week.

2610
01:43:42,400 --> 01:43:45,120
I didn't think I was gonna like it as much as I did.

2611
01:43:46,140 --> 01:43:48,340
Well, I knew I was gonna like Portal 2,

2612
01:43:48,340 --> 01:43:50,700
but I didn't know that I'd like it as much as I did.

2613
01:43:50,700 --> 01:43:53,960
So, yeah, I mean, I'm sure there's a bunch of games,

2614
01:43:53,960 --> 01:43:55,080
but I'm still loving this show,

2615
01:43:55,080 --> 01:43:57,940
and I'm still waiting for my biscuits, Rob.

2616
01:43:57,940 --> 01:43:58,900
I'll work on that.

2617
01:43:58,900 --> 01:44:01,140
They're with the tea and crumpets.

2618
01:44:01,140 --> 01:44:03,220
So, PS, if you're an MMO player,

2619
01:44:03,220 --> 01:44:04,720
you'll love the attached image, I hope.

2620
01:44:04,720 --> 01:44:05,860
Okay, let's have a look.

2621
01:44:06,980 --> 01:44:09,420
The Nine Circles of MMO Hell.

2622
01:44:09,420 --> 01:44:11,020
You know what, I'm actually gonna save this

2623
01:44:11,020 --> 01:44:13,080
and post it on our...

2624
01:44:13,080 --> 01:44:13,920
Tumblr.

2625
01:44:13,920 --> 01:44:14,740
Tumblr.

2626
01:44:14,740 --> 01:44:15,580
There you go.

2627
01:44:15,580 --> 01:44:16,420
Okay, so let me just save.

2628
01:44:16,420 --> 01:44:17,900
Orangelandsradio.tumblr.com.

2629
01:44:17,900 --> 01:44:21,260
Image, I'll do MMO Hell.

2630
01:44:21,260 --> 01:44:22,960
You could do it after the mailbag statement.

2631
01:44:22,960 --> 01:44:24,100
I'm just saving the image,

2632
01:44:24,100 --> 01:44:26,460
because I'm gonna close the email.

2633
01:44:26,460 --> 01:44:29,280
So, bite my behind, Rob.

2634
01:44:29,280 --> 01:44:30,420
You ready?

2635
01:44:30,420 --> 01:44:31,940
Newsflash!

2636
01:44:31,940 --> 01:44:34,340
The tester season three is casting, info below.

2637
01:44:34,340 --> 01:44:36,700
I'll be watching, not auditioning, Rob-a-buh.

2638
01:44:36,700 --> 01:44:38,420
Oh, yes, I heard about this on Twitter this week,

2639
01:44:38,420 --> 01:44:39,920
and I sent it over to Lokey-O-L-R,

2640
01:44:39,920 --> 01:44:41,020
and I was like, Lokey,

2641
01:44:41,020 --> 01:44:42,620
weren't you saying something about

2642
01:44:42,620 --> 01:44:44,900
you'd like to try a new career?

2643
01:44:44,900 --> 01:44:46,760
Well, I will link it in the chat room,

2644
01:44:46,760 --> 01:44:48,540
and if any of you make it on there,

2645
01:44:48,540 --> 01:44:51,220
plug the crap out of us.

2646
01:44:51,220 --> 01:44:53,100
Actually, I wanna say,

2647
01:44:54,340 --> 01:44:56,220
they were saying that the prize for the winner

2648
01:44:56,220 --> 01:44:58,940
this season isn't like a testing thing,

2649
01:44:58,940 --> 01:45:01,980
it's like actually a role in production.

2650
01:45:01,980 --> 01:45:03,580
So, they're kinda up in the ante

2651
01:45:03,580 --> 01:45:05,100
on prize this year a little bit.

2652
01:45:05,100 --> 01:45:06,940
Okay, Jamie's trying out.

2653
01:45:06,940 --> 01:45:08,020
For real?

2654
01:45:08,020 --> 01:45:08,860
Why not?

2655
01:45:08,860 --> 01:45:09,680
Oh my God, you should.

2656
01:45:09,680 --> 01:45:10,780
Oh my God.

2657
01:45:10,780 --> 01:45:12,740
Sign up now, why not?

2658
01:45:12,740 --> 01:45:14,220
Look into it, and see if the prize

2659
01:45:14,220 --> 01:45:15,580
is something you'd actually want.

2660
01:45:15,580 --> 01:45:17,020
Well, because if they can get me in

2661
01:45:17,020 --> 01:45:20,200
as any level of art production.

2662
01:45:20,200 --> 01:45:21,040
Yeah, I-

2663
01:45:21,040 --> 01:45:22,020
That's just my career, right there.

2664
01:45:22,020 --> 01:45:25,380
I believe the prize is like actual,

2665
01:45:25,380 --> 01:45:27,460
on the production team this time.

2666
01:45:27,460 --> 01:45:29,940
And it better not be pee-on,

2667
01:45:29,940 --> 01:45:32,040
because I actually have some skills to offer.

2668
01:45:32,040 --> 01:45:33,560
You know what, if you start as pee-on

2669
01:45:33,560 --> 01:45:35,260
for like two months, you'll probably move up real quick.

2670
01:45:35,260 --> 01:45:37,540
That guy who won the first season of the tester

2671
01:45:37,540 --> 01:45:39,860
only tested for like a couple months,

2672
01:45:39,860 --> 01:45:42,020
and now he does marketing stuff.

2673
01:45:42,020 --> 01:45:43,380
So...

2674
01:45:43,380 --> 01:45:44,900
Dude, wouldn't that be crazy?

2675
01:45:46,900 --> 01:45:48,480
You know what, Dark Soccer, if you try out

2676
01:45:48,480 --> 01:45:51,180
and you get your little thing online or whatever,

2677
01:45:51,180 --> 01:45:52,740
I'll help you make your video.

2678
01:45:52,740 --> 01:45:55,400
Okay.

2679
01:45:55,400 --> 01:45:56,580
But you, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2680
01:45:56,580 --> 01:45:58,180
You used to, wait, hold on, hold on,

2681
01:45:58,180 --> 01:46:00,120
cause I just gotta, okay.

2682
01:46:01,060 --> 01:46:02,820
If I'm not mistaking, Dark Soccer,

2683
01:46:02,820 --> 01:46:05,260
you hate reality television,

2684
01:46:05,260 --> 01:46:06,980
and for a long time on this program,

2685
01:46:06,980 --> 01:46:09,780
you never wanted to be on video, correct?

2686
01:46:09,780 --> 01:46:10,620
Yes.

2687
01:46:10,620 --> 01:46:13,740
So you are now auditioning for a reality TV show.

2688
01:46:13,740 --> 01:46:16,420
Am I understanding correctly?

2689
01:46:16,420 --> 01:46:19,300
If a job comes out of it, me, who is currently jobless.

2690
01:46:20,180 --> 01:46:22,420
Rob, you have no idea what I've been trying to do

2691
01:46:22,420 --> 01:46:23,740
to get hired, okay?

2692
01:46:25,060 --> 01:46:28,660
I just, it's kinda crazy, but I love it.

2693
01:46:28,660 --> 01:46:29,620
I hope you get on.

2694
01:46:29,620 --> 01:46:31,320
I actually watched the tester.

2695
01:46:32,500 --> 01:46:33,860
Might I go so far as to say

2696
01:46:33,860 --> 01:46:35,420
I enjoyed the last season of the tester.

2697
01:46:35,420 --> 01:46:37,980
I think they could do a little more with it, but...

2698
01:46:39,340 --> 01:46:41,780
You might also wanna watch the show.

2699
01:46:41,780 --> 01:46:43,980
They give you an option for them not to share your shit.

2700
01:46:43,980 --> 01:46:44,820
That's good.

2701
01:46:44,820 --> 01:46:47,140
You have an idea what to expect, just saying.

2702
01:46:47,140 --> 01:46:52,140
Oh, man.

2703
01:46:52,780 --> 01:46:54,020
I can't wait.

2704
01:46:54,020 --> 01:46:55,780
I hope Dark Soccer gets on the show.

2705
01:46:55,780 --> 01:46:57,940
Of course, that means she won't be on OLR for a few weeks

2706
01:46:57,940 --> 01:47:00,140
while they're taping the show.

2707
01:47:00,140 --> 01:47:01,940
Party at Jamie's house.

2708
01:47:01,940 --> 01:47:04,900
Well, yeah, but I'll be famous and you won't.

2709
01:47:06,500 --> 01:47:07,700
Wow.

2710
01:47:07,700 --> 01:47:09,300
You'll get booted off first.

2711
01:47:09,300 --> 01:47:10,440
No, I won't.

2712
01:47:12,060 --> 01:47:13,540
It doesn't like my password.

2713
01:47:14,460 --> 01:47:15,820
All right, let's move on.

2714
01:47:15,820 --> 01:47:16,640
Do we have any more emails

2715
01:47:16,640 --> 01:47:17,480
or was it the last one?

2716
01:47:17,480 --> 01:47:18,300
I'll ask you in a second.

2717
01:47:18,300 --> 01:47:19,140
All right.

2718
01:47:20,580 --> 01:47:22,100
I'm enhancing my celebrity.

2719
01:47:22,100 --> 01:47:24,580
You have all week to try out for that stinking show.

2720
01:47:24,580 --> 01:47:26,160
Okay.

2721
01:47:26,160 --> 01:47:29,100
Hey, OLR, it's SonicM88 here.

2722
01:47:29,100 --> 01:47:31,060
I've been intermittently listening to the podcast

2723
01:47:31,060 --> 01:47:32,580
and live show for a few years,

2724
01:47:32,580 --> 01:47:35,060
so you probably don't recognize the name.

2725
01:47:35,060 --> 01:47:36,300
We don't recognize a lot of you people.

2726
01:47:36,300 --> 01:47:37,740
I mean, hi.

2727
01:47:37,740 --> 01:47:38,580
I'm kidding, kitty.

2728
01:47:38,580 --> 01:47:40,100
I heard that name in chat earlier tonight, so welcome.

2729
01:47:40,100 --> 01:47:41,900
Anyway, I picked up a 3DS this week

2730
01:47:41,900 --> 01:47:43,160
so I can get the retro games

2731
01:47:43,160 --> 01:47:45,640
and also the money back from the price drop.

2732
01:47:45,640 --> 01:47:47,380
As Loki predicted, GameStop has decided

2733
01:47:47,380 --> 01:47:49,360
not to honor the price guarantee thing,

2734
01:47:49,360 --> 01:47:50,780
which does not surprise me at all.

2735
01:47:50,780 --> 01:47:52,640
In fact, I'm not even sure I'll be able

2736
01:47:52,640 --> 01:47:55,860
to get the AD back from where I purchased it.

2737
01:47:55,860 --> 01:47:57,260
I bought it at Best Buy

2738
01:47:57,260 --> 01:47:58,760
and they didn't know about the price drop

2739
01:47:58,760 --> 01:48:01,060
or didn't say anything about not honoring their policy

2740
01:48:01,060 --> 01:48:03,220
when I bought it, but I have this feeling

2741
01:48:03,220 --> 01:48:04,060
that it won't work.

2742
01:48:04,060 --> 01:48:06,360
Either way, in my mind, it's totally worth it

2743
01:48:06,360 --> 01:48:08,560
just for the GBA titles alone.

2744
01:48:08,560 --> 01:48:10,900
I really miss the Game Boy as a platform.

2745
01:48:10,900 --> 01:48:13,580
I never really got into the DS like I did with the Game Boy

2746
01:48:13,580 --> 01:48:16,420
and ended up selling the one I had three years ago.

2747
01:48:16,420 --> 01:48:19,580
So I've been out of the DS world for three years.

2748
01:48:19,580 --> 01:48:20,860
That's where you come in.

2749
01:48:20,860 --> 01:48:24,460
I'd like to keep my DS for more than just retro GBA titles

2750
01:48:24,460 --> 01:48:25,980
I bought it for, so I would like to hear

2751
01:48:25,980 --> 01:48:28,980
some of your favorite DS games that might suit my interests.

2752
01:48:28,980 --> 01:48:31,380
What do you recommend as games that appeal to everyone

2753
01:48:31,380 --> 01:48:34,140
and what specific titles would interest someone like me?

2754
01:48:34,140 --> 01:48:35,860
I'm not a fan of RPGs anymore.

2755
01:48:35,860 --> 01:48:37,140
Oh, hang up, no, I'm kidding.

2756
01:48:37,140 --> 01:48:39,180
Since I don't have the time to play them,

2757
01:48:39,180 --> 01:48:41,400
I'm more into shooters, arcade games, and platformers.

2758
01:48:41,400 --> 01:48:42,740
I plan on getting Geometry Wars,

2759
01:48:42,740 --> 01:48:44,300
Galaxies, a Castlevania title.

2760
01:48:44,300 --> 01:48:45,340
Which one is best?

2761
01:48:45,340 --> 01:48:46,460
Oh, what was that one?

2762
01:48:46,460 --> 01:48:48,180
Order of Ecclesia was really good.

2763
01:48:50,100 --> 01:48:51,820
Retro Game Challenge, Wire Your Wear Touch,

2764
01:48:51,820 --> 01:48:53,140
Trauma Center 2.

2765
01:48:53,140 --> 01:48:54,900
I picked a book arena of time, obviously,

2766
01:48:54,900 --> 01:48:57,260
and Plants vs. Zombies download version so far.

2767
01:48:57,260 --> 01:48:59,340
Oh, and Mario Kart DS is my favorite DS game

2768
01:48:59,340 --> 01:49:00,860
from when I owned one before.

2769
01:49:01,980 --> 01:49:04,920
I got Puyo Pop, I mean Puyo Puyo.

2770
01:49:04,920 --> 01:49:07,220
I've got Otsutatakayo Endan,

2771
01:49:07,220 --> 01:49:08,500
or you could get Elite Beat Agents.

2772
01:49:08,500 --> 01:49:10,540
I actually really prefer the Japanese one.

2773
01:49:10,540 --> 01:49:13,500
Um, what else is in my thing?

2774
01:49:13,500 --> 01:49:17,300
Oh yeah, what was that Professor Hatsworth game?

2775
01:49:17,300 --> 01:49:18,320
Professor Layton?

2776
01:49:18,320 --> 01:49:19,800
No, it was Hatsworth.

2777
01:49:21,280 --> 01:49:23,340
It's like a combination puzzle game

2778
01:49:23,340 --> 01:49:25,740
and investigation game.

2779
01:49:25,740 --> 01:49:26,780
It's really interesting.

2780
01:49:26,780 --> 01:49:28,220
Yeah, I kinda know what you're talking about, yeah.

2781
01:49:28,220 --> 01:49:30,300
That game was pretty fun.

2782
01:49:30,300 --> 01:49:32,140
I don't know, what else, Rob?

2783
01:49:32,140 --> 01:49:33,420
He named a lot of them.

2784
01:49:33,420 --> 01:49:36,120
I mean, gosh, you got a whole full plate there.

2785
01:49:36,120 --> 01:49:37,580
Retro Game Challenge was one of the ones

2786
01:49:37,580 --> 01:49:38,820
that came to my mind too.

2787
01:49:38,820 --> 01:49:43,820
Um, oh, really good games on DS.

2788
01:49:46,040 --> 01:49:47,740
I need more time to think.

2789
01:49:47,740 --> 01:49:49,460
Actually, I should just go grab my DS case

2790
01:49:49,460 --> 01:49:50,300
and see what's in it.

2791
01:49:50,300 --> 01:49:51,140
I know, right?

2792
01:49:51,140 --> 01:49:52,460
Like, I'm like, I can't see my DS collection

2793
01:49:52,460 --> 01:49:53,460
right in front of me.

2794
01:49:55,020 --> 01:49:56,940
A lot of people are really into the Pokemon games.

2795
01:49:56,940 --> 01:49:58,380
I play a lot of Cookie Mama.

2796
01:49:59,420 --> 01:50:01,580
Since he's talking about Trauma Center,

2797
01:50:01,580 --> 01:50:03,900
Cookie Mama's like that with food.

2798
01:50:03,900 --> 01:50:07,300
So it's really fun, and don't worry, Mama will fix it.

2799
01:50:07,300 --> 01:50:09,260
I liked the game, the Kirby game,

2800
01:50:09,260 --> 01:50:10,940
where you draw the lines.

2801
01:50:10,940 --> 01:50:12,120
Oh, um.

2802
01:50:13,140 --> 01:50:13,980
Kirby's.

2803
01:50:13,980 --> 01:50:14,820
Epic Yarn.

2804
01:50:14,820 --> 01:50:16,440
No, no, that was the Wii game.

2805
01:50:17,500 --> 01:50:18,680
It was a different Kirby game

2806
01:50:18,680 --> 01:50:20,420
where you would draw all the lines and stuff.

2807
01:50:20,420 --> 01:50:22,200
I don't remember.

2808
01:50:22,200 --> 01:50:23,660
Making me think.

2809
01:50:23,660 --> 01:50:25,140
Am I a talk show host?

2810
01:50:26,340 --> 01:50:28,700
Some of the old school, like even the Mario 64 port's

2811
01:50:28,700 --> 01:50:30,220
actually really good too.

2812
01:50:30,220 --> 01:50:32,620
Oh, Elite Beat Agents, says Dungeon Busters and Chat.

2813
01:50:32,620 --> 01:50:34,540
Well, I said that, it says it Oendon,

2814
01:50:34,540 --> 01:50:36,500
but I said you can get it as Elite Beat Agents,

2815
01:50:36,500 --> 01:50:37,740
although I prefer Oendon.

2816
01:50:41,140 --> 01:50:42,900
Oh, there's Ragnarok.

2817
01:50:42,900 --> 01:50:44,660
And that's RPG though.

2818
01:50:44,660 --> 01:50:46,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2819
01:50:46,180 --> 01:50:47,020
I liked it though.

2820
01:50:47,020 --> 01:50:48,620
Break Man says Civilization Revolution.

2821
01:50:48,620 --> 01:50:49,960
I really liked that game.

2822
01:50:49,960 --> 01:50:52,460
But I liked it on the consoles.

2823
01:50:52,460 --> 01:50:53,300
I don't know how well it pointed over to DS.

2824
01:50:53,300 --> 01:50:55,660
I should get my DS case and look.

2825
01:50:55,660 --> 01:50:58,380
Then again, I've got like a box of games, so.

2826
01:50:59,300 --> 01:51:01,980
I'll lend you one, maybe.

2827
01:51:01,980 --> 01:51:04,040
I'll sell you some of them.

2828
01:51:04,040 --> 01:51:05,100
I might not be listening live

2829
01:51:05,100 --> 01:51:06,340
because of work early in the morning.

2830
01:51:06,340 --> 01:51:07,260
I'm on the East Coast.

2831
01:51:07,260 --> 01:51:09,340
So if the chat has any good recommendations too,

2832
01:51:09,340 --> 01:51:10,860
I would love to hear those in the podcast,

2833
01:51:10,860 --> 01:51:12,100
which we just did.

2834
01:51:12,100 --> 01:51:13,860
Oh, he said he's not into RPGs,

2835
01:51:13,860 --> 01:51:17,100
but the Final Fantasy IV remake is so fucking good.

2836
01:51:17,100 --> 01:51:19,120
Like, you might want to think about

2837
01:51:19,120 --> 01:51:20,560
going back to RPGs for that.

2838
01:51:22,080 --> 01:51:23,660
Keep up the great work with the podcast.

2839
01:51:23,660 --> 01:51:25,420
It's still my favorite out there by a long shot.

2840
01:51:25,420 --> 01:51:26,740
Thanks guys, SonicM88.

2841
01:51:26,740 --> 01:51:29,220
Oh, and by the way, I am playing Final Fantasy III,

2842
01:51:29,220 --> 01:51:31,540
and it's pretty good on the game.

2843
01:51:31,540 --> 01:51:32,500
See, there you go.

2844
01:51:34,340 --> 01:51:35,300
Oh, great.

2845
01:51:35,300 --> 01:51:38,300
My profile's made.

2846
01:51:38,300 --> 01:51:39,700
Oh, I love what Zethur says here.

2847
01:51:39,700 --> 01:51:41,760
Meteos is awesome.

2848
01:51:41,760 --> 01:51:43,220
Meteos was an amazing DS game.

2849
01:51:43,220 --> 01:51:44,640
Electroplankton was kind of fun.

2850
01:51:44,640 --> 01:51:46,200
That was a great DS game.

2851
01:51:47,480 --> 01:51:48,860
All right, is that it for emails?

2852
01:51:48,860 --> 01:51:51,020
Yeah, and by the way, I've got a profile now.

2853
01:51:51,020 --> 01:51:53,780
Mailbag at Orangeloungeradio.com.

2854
01:51:53,780 --> 01:51:55,680
I ain't got a picture, but I'll link it in the chat room.

2855
01:51:55,680 --> 01:51:56,860
Are you gonna, you should put a picture.

2856
01:51:56,860 --> 01:51:58,060
You need to start filling it out

2857
01:51:58,060 --> 01:52:00,220
with why you need to be on the tester.

2858
01:52:00,220 --> 01:52:01,300
I will, but I'm linking it already.

2859
01:52:01,300 --> 01:52:02,420
I need a job.

2860
01:52:02,420 --> 01:52:06,260
You have to talk about how much you love Sony

2861
01:52:06,260 --> 01:52:09,020
and how you've been a gaming girl all your life

2862
01:52:09,020 --> 01:52:10,140
and dah, dah, dah.

2863
01:52:10,140 --> 01:52:11,940
I bet you'll get on.

2864
01:52:11,940 --> 01:52:12,800
I bet you will.

2865
01:52:14,980 --> 01:52:16,820
All right, anyhow, moving on.

2866
01:52:16,820 --> 01:52:18,300
We got some more news stories for you guys.

2867
01:52:18,300 --> 01:52:19,700
Oh, we got the FUs of the Week.

2868
01:52:19,700 --> 01:52:20,640
We gotta do those.

2869
01:52:20,640 --> 01:52:25,640
As much fun as I would like to join the tester,

2870
01:52:25,640 --> 01:52:29,980
I would hate to have to move to LA to be a game tester.

2871
01:52:29,980 --> 01:52:31,820
Yeah, you do know you have to move to Santa Monica

2872
01:52:31,820 --> 01:52:34,580
to be a game, to do the production, right?

2873
01:52:34,580 --> 01:52:35,420
She doesn't care.

2874
01:52:35,420 --> 01:52:36,260
I don't care.

2875
01:52:36,260 --> 01:52:37,080
All right.

2876
01:52:37,080 --> 01:52:37,920
I'll commute.

2877
01:52:37,920 --> 01:52:38,760
She'll be closer to Disneyland.

2878
01:52:38,760 --> 01:52:40,780
We'll be closer to Disneyland.

2879
01:52:40,780 --> 01:52:42,220
But see, the problem is though,

2880
01:52:42,220 --> 01:52:45,460
it's a judging panel that decides whether,

2881
01:52:45,460 --> 01:52:46,440
or is it challenges?

2882
01:52:46,440 --> 01:52:47,280
I don't know.

2883
01:52:47,280 --> 01:52:48,740
I've never watched a show.

2884
01:52:48,740 --> 01:52:51,580
It's weird challenges that sometimes have nothing

2885
01:52:51,580 --> 01:52:52,420
to do with games.

2886
01:52:52,420 --> 01:52:53,820
Yeah, it's like we challenge you to like,

2887
01:52:53,820 --> 01:52:56,660
it's not like, see, cause when I first heard

2888
01:52:56,660 --> 01:52:58,740
about the tester, I was thinking it's that

2889
01:52:58,740 --> 01:53:03,740
there was a show that was on like sci-fi or spike

2890
01:53:04,420 --> 01:53:05,260
or something like that.

2891
01:53:05,260 --> 01:53:07,600
It was where they were actually playing games

2892
01:53:07,600 --> 01:53:10,940
and they had game related challenges and stuff like that.

2893
01:53:10,940 --> 01:53:14,860
But this is something stupid.

2894
01:53:14,860 --> 01:53:15,880
Okay, here's what I said.

2895
01:53:15,880 --> 01:53:16,720
I'd be an asshole.

2896
01:53:16,720 --> 01:53:18,900
I own more than 40 different video game systems

2897
01:53:18,900 --> 01:53:20,300
and have decades of experience.

2898
01:53:20,300 --> 01:53:22,460
I'm also a graphic designer with a focus on video games

2899
01:53:22,460 --> 01:53:24,420
and an experience in 3D design in Maya.

2900
01:53:24,420 --> 01:53:25,480
I could use a job.

2901
01:53:25,480 --> 01:53:29,480
How's that sound?

2902
01:53:29,480 --> 01:53:31,680
You should give a shout out to the podcast too.

2903
01:53:31,680 --> 01:53:32,680
Just for when you,

2904
01:53:35,920 --> 01:53:36,920
just for, you know.

2905
01:53:39,280 --> 01:53:42,620
When I am on, I'll do it in my video.

2906
01:53:43,800 --> 01:53:45,300
Oh my God, I gotta do a video.

2907
01:53:46,520 --> 01:53:47,640
I better be super cute.

2908
01:53:47,640 --> 01:53:49,040
Better get your hair did.

2909
01:53:49,040 --> 01:53:51,640
I need to get my hair did, my nails did.

2910
01:53:51,640 --> 01:53:53,880
They're still naming DS games in the chat.

2911
01:53:53,880 --> 01:53:55,600
Zether says Contra 4.

2912
01:53:55,600 --> 01:53:56,440
That was pretty good.

2913
01:53:56,440 --> 01:53:57,600
That was pretty good.

2914
01:53:57,600 --> 01:53:59,060
Break Man in chat says,

2915
01:53:59,060 --> 01:54:00,400
Loki couldn't do the tester

2916
01:54:00,400 --> 01:54:02,080
because Loki doesn't take orders.

2917
01:54:02,080 --> 01:54:03,560
Loki gives orders.

2918
01:54:03,560 --> 01:54:04,400
Mwahaha.

2919
01:54:05,440 --> 01:54:06,280
There you go.

2920
01:54:06,280 --> 01:54:08,760
What are you, what are you looking at there?

2921
01:54:08,760 --> 01:54:10,640
Are you like doing a tiny tower cheat?

2922
01:54:10,640 --> 01:54:11,880
Is that what's happening?

2923
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:16,240
Did you cheat and you have 6 million gold in tiny tower

2924
01:54:16,240 --> 01:54:17,080
you damn cheater?

2925
01:54:17,080 --> 01:54:18,120
What the crap?

2926
01:54:18,120 --> 01:54:18,960
I am a cheater.

2927
01:54:18,960 --> 01:54:20,240
You are a damn dirty cheater.

2928
01:54:20,240 --> 01:54:21,080
How did you do it?

2929
01:54:21,080 --> 01:54:21,900
No, I'm not cheating.

2930
01:54:21,900 --> 01:54:22,740
I don't wanna know.

2931
01:54:22,740 --> 01:54:23,580
I have a jailbroken device.

2932
01:54:23,580 --> 01:54:25,080
I can do whatever the fuck I want.

2933
01:54:25,080 --> 01:54:27,880
And it's completely legal.

2934
01:54:27,880 --> 01:54:31,100
You're a lying, cheating sack of shit.

2935
01:54:31,100 --> 01:54:31,940
That's why.

2936
01:54:31,940 --> 01:54:33,000
My tiny tower ain't gonna be tiny no more.

2937
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,920
That's why you're not gonna be a fucking game tester.

2938
01:54:37,500 --> 01:54:39,000
Cause you can't play by the rules.

2939
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:39,840
Bullshit.

2940
01:54:39,840 --> 01:54:40,840
I could be an awesome tester.

2941
01:54:40,840 --> 01:54:41,680
You know what?

2942
01:54:41,680 --> 01:54:43,240
In fact, there was a thing that I saw.

2943
01:54:43,240 --> 01:54:44,880
My picture and it's cute.

2944
01:54:44,880 --> 01:54:45,720
Listen, there you go.

2945
01:54:45,720 --> 01:54:47,360
There's a, I mean, shit.

2946
01:54:47,360 --> 01:54:49,960
I've played so much Grand Theft Auto.

2947
01:54:49,960 --> 01:54:51,120
I could easily be a tester

2948
01:54:51,120 --> 01:54:52,880
for their goddamn multiplayer stuff.

2949
01:54:52,880 --> 01:54:54,520
I know the ins and outs of all

2950
01:54:54,520 --> 01:54:57,440
of their Grand Theft Auto games, including the PSP.

2951
01:54:57,440 --> 01:55:00,360
I know shit that they probably don't even know.

2952
01:55:00,360 --> 01:55:02,120
But then again, I don't want to compete

2953
01:55:02,120 --> 01:55:04,400
on a show where I have to compare images

2954
01:55:04,400 --> 01:55:05,760
to see what's different.

2955
01:55:05,760 --> 01:55:08,080
If I wanted to do that, I'd buy a DS.

2956
01:55:11,800 --> 01:55:12,680
All right.

2957
01:55:12,680 --> 01:55:15,040
Break Man says, when you apply for the job, Dark Soccer,

2958
01:55:15,040 --> 01:55:17,080
just tell them you know the Bobby Black Wolf.

2959
01:55:17,080 --> 01:55:18,260
You'll be hired on right away.

2960
01:55:18,260 --> 01:55:19,100
That's true.

2961
01:55:19,100 --> 01:55:21,560
After all, he is a trending topic in Sacramento this evening.

2962
01:55:21,560 --> 01:55:24,520
Yep.

2963
01:55:24,520 --> 01:55:25,280
All right.

2964
01:55:25,280 --> 01:55:26,800
Let's get to the FUs of the week.

2965
01:55:43,280 --> 01:55:48,880
My FU of the week goes to me not having a copy of Black Matrix.

2966
01:55:48,880 --> 01:55:50,040
I found it on eBay.

2967
01:55:50,040 --> 01:55:51,240
No one will buy it for me.

2968
01:55:51,240 --> 01:55:53,480
Boo hoo.

2969
01:55:53,480 --> 01:55:56,840
My FU of the week goes to Loki for cheating on a tiny tower.

2970
01:55:56,840 --> 01:56:02,720
And I hope his tower, because it's so cheaply made,

2971
01:56:02,720 --> 01:56:05,320
I hope that the material that his tiny tower was made out

2972
01:56:05,320 --> 01:56:06,880
of just collapses on itself.

2973
01:56:06,880 --> 01:56:09,040
And the whole building just implodes on itself.

2974
01:56:09,040 --> 01:56:11,000
He'll have the blood of his bitizens on his hands.

2975
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:11,640
Exactly.

2976
01:56:11,640 --> 01:56:15,320
And you'll have the blood of all those bitizens on your hands.

2977
01:56:15,320 --> 01:56:18,160
Otherwise, I give an FU to tacos for being so delicious

2978
01:56:18,160 --> 01:56:20,120
and making me fat.

2979
01:56:20,120 --> 01:56:22,400
Loki.

2980
01:56:22,400 --> 01:56:26,520
I guess my FU would go to the tester.

2981
01:56:26,520 --> 01:56:32,080
Because if I were to win the tester,

2982
01:56:32,080 --> 01:56:33,760
I'd end up working at Sony.

2983
01:56:33,760 --> 01:56:37,320
And I'd look at the sheet of things that they want me to test.

2984
01:56:37,320 --> 01:56:37,880
I'm sorry.

2985
01:56:37,880 --> 01:56:39,600
I don't see that this, you know, I'm

2986
01:56:39,600 --> 01:56:43,480
supposed to test to see if this game doesn't suck.

2987
01:56:43,480 --> 01:56:44,360
I don't know.

2988
01:56:44,360 --> 01:56:45,200
I got nothing.

2989
01:56:45,200 --> 01:56:48,280
I'm not really mad at anything.

2990
01:56:48,280 --> 01:56:53,240
It was surprisingly easy to do with the jailbroken device,

2991
01:56:53,240 --> 01:56:55,400
I might add.

2992
01:56:55,400 --> 01:56:57,720
Download a file, copy it over, done.

2993
01:56:57,720 --> 01:56:59,280
And it didn't even erase my progress.

2994
01:56:59,280 --> 01:57:01,120
It just added 6 million money.

2995
01:57:01,120 --> 01:57:04,840
All right, so I see that DarkSakura has a profile.

2996
01:57:04,840 --> 01:57:05,960
Like, how do I vote for you?

2997
01:57:05,960 --> 01:57:08,200
Oh, there's a big clock in the corner.

2998
01:57:08,200 --> 01:57:10,360
Voting begins in 16 days.

2999
01:57:10,360 --> 01:57:14,360
Like, I can't actually vote for you yet, I guess.

3000
01:57:14,360 --> 01:57:16,400
Like, I would make a profile and endorse you.

3001
01:57:16,400 --> 01:57:19,240
But then doesn't that put me in the pool to try out for the show?

3002
01:57:19,240 --> 01:57:19,960
No.

3003
01:57:19,960 --> 01:57:21,720
You pick whether you're going to be a voter

3004
01:57:21,720 --> 01:57:22,520
or you're going to be a candidate.

3005
01:57:22,520 --> 01:57:23,040
Oh, OK.

3006
01:57:23,040 --> 01:57:24,280
OK, then I'll sign up later.

3007
01:57:24,280 --> 01:57:25,560
And I'll vote for you.

3008
01:57:25,560 --> 01:57:28,320
But can I get the URL out to everybody so they can vote for you?

3009
01:57:28,320 --> 01:57:30,160
I linked it in the chat room, so go for it.

3010
01:57:30,160 --> 01:57:35,600
H-T-T-P-S, secure website, colon slash slash casting dot

3011
01:57:35,600 --> 01:57:39,840
the tester dot com slash DarkSakura.

3012
01:57:39,840 --> 01:57:40,440
There you go.

3013
01:57:40,440 --> 01:57:42,940
I've added a second picture of what my hair looks like curly.

3014
01:57:42,940 --> 01:57:45,440
You know, it just occurred to me.

3015
01:57:45,440 --> 01:57:48,640
Derek H., I think on Dead Pixel Live last year,

3016
01:57:48,640 --> 01:57:51,960
had the casting dude for the tester on his show.

3017
01:57:51,960 --> 01:57:55,200
You need to talk to Derek and get dude's email address

3018
01:57:55,200 --> 01:57:57,360
and just be like, yo, cast me.

3019
01:57:57,360 --> 01:57:58,520
That's what you need to do.

3020
01:57:58,520 --> 01:58:01,760
You need to just bypass this whole system right here.

3021
01:58:01,760 --> 01:58:07,360
You need to go directly to show, do not pass go.

3022
01:58:07,360 --> 01:58:08,920
We should all be on the tester.

3023
01:58:08,920 --> 01:58:10,200
No, we're not all going on.

3024
01:58:10,200 --> 01:58:11,920
I'm not going on that goddamn show.

3025
01:58:11,920 --> 01:58:13,320
Come on, it'd be hilarious.

3026
01:58:13,320 --> 01:58:15,480
If I go on the show, it is to be a judge,

3027
01:58:15,480 --> 01:58:17,760
because I would enjoy nothing more than the judge, the two

3028
01:58:17,760 --> 01:58:20,120
of you sitting up there getting ready for elimination.

3029
01:58:20,120 --> 01:58:23,600
I think that guy doesn't know shit about testing games.

3030
01:58:23,600 --> 01:58:27,800
He wasn't even a trending topic in Sacramento.

3031
01:58:27,800 --> 01:58:30,440
Well, Loki, you're a goddamn cheater at all your video games.

3032
01:58:30,440 --> 01:58:32,080
Explain why you should be on the tester.

3033
01:58:32,080 --> 01:58:35,320
Because I know where to find the information

3034
01:58:35,320 --> 01:58:36,320
that you're looking for.

3035
01:58:36,320 --> 01:58:40,640
I know to find all the exploits and back doors for your games

3036
01:58:40,640 --> 01:58:42,680
and how to get around this stuff.

3037
01:58:42,680 --> 01:58:45,600
If you don't fix this shit, other people are going to do it.

3038
01:58:45,600 --> 01:58:47,800
DarkSakura, your Kinect is still in a box.

3039
01:58:47,800 --> 01:58:50,000
Why should you be the tester?

3040
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:51,680
Because my Kinect's in the box.

3041
01:58:51,680 --> 01:58:54,080
My move is fucking on the TV.

3042
01:58:54,080 --> 01:58:58,160
That is why I need to be a fucking tester.

3043
01:58:58,160 --> 01:59:00,560
Because we have a goddamn Gran Turismo setup

3044
01:59:00,560 --> 01:59:04,160
built in our house, where we can play in a fucking race car.

3045
01:59:04,160 --> 01:59:05,400
Is your name DarkSakura?

3046
01:59:05,400 --> 01:59:06,000
That's funny.

3047
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:07,840
You don't sound like DarkSakura.

3048
01:59:07,840 --> 01:59:10,840
I can say, well, because we have a $400 rig set up

3049
01:59:10,840 --> 01:59:17,280
to play Gran Turismo 5, and that we've built seats

3050
01:59:17,280 --> 01:59:21,280
to play this set up out of the seats from a Honda Prelude,

3051
01:59:21,280 --> 01:59:22,760
two of them.

3052
01:59:22,760 --> 01:59:25,880
I have every Sony system ever made.

3053
01:59:25,880 --> 01:59:27,920
OK, here.

3054
01:59:27,920 --> 01:59:30,040
This is fine radio and all, but there's

3055
01:59:30,040 --> 01:59:32,560
a part of me that is legit worried you're actually

3056
01:59:32,560 --> 01:59:34,720
going to get on this show.

3057
01:59:34,720 --> 01:59:36,160
I have legitimate concerns.

3058
01:59:36,160 --> 01:59:38,520
If I get a job out of this, fuck yeah.

3059
01:59:38,520 --> 01:59:40,920
But this could also end up very bad.

3060
01:59:40,920 --> 01:59:42,920
You could end up being the bitch.

3061
01:59:42,920 --> 01:59:47,200
I've seen you go without eating for some time.

3062
01:59:47,200 --> 01:59:49,640
It is not going to be pretty if you have to do something.

3063
01:59:49,640 --> 01:59:51,280
Yes, Rob knows what low blood sugar Jamie is like.

3064
01:59:51,280 --> 01:59:52,680
And you might have to do something

3065
01:59:52,680 --> 01:59:54,240
that you don't like on this program.

3066
01:59:54,240 --> 01:59:55,200
And I am very worried.

3067
01:59:55,200 --> 01:59:56,080
I should sign up too.

3068
01:59:56,080 --> 01:59:57,200
You'll be hilarious.

3069
01:59:57,200 --> 01:59:57,760
Like what?

3070
01:59:57,760 --> 02:00:00,320
Play Imagine Babies?

3071
02:00:00,320 --> 02:00:03,680
OK, one last season they had some fucking challenge

3072
02:00:03,680 --> 02:00:05,640
where they were out there doing army stuff.

3073
02:00:05,640 --> 02:00:06,960
And OK, I know.

3074
02:00:06,960 --> 02:00:08,400
I know it'll piss you off.

3075
02:00:08,400 --> 02:00:11,920
Working together as a team with people who are idiots.

3076
02:00:11,920 --> 02:00:14,040
That is going to piss you off beyond belief.

3077
02:00:14,040 --> 02:00:15,640
See, you're already fretting.

3078
02:00:15,640 --> 02:00:17,360
No, I will tell you this.

3079
02:00:17,360 --> 02:00:22,160
Because I worked with idiots at my job and I hit it very well.

3080
02:00:22,160 --> 02:00:26,160
I know how to be a team fucking player.

3081
02:00:26,160 --> 02:00:27,160
I am good.

3082
02:00:27,160 --> 02:00:29,680
Can you teach Loki a thing or two?

3083
02:00:29,680 --> 02:00:30,200
No.

3084
02:00:30,200 --> 02:00:32,160
I am my own team.

3085
02:00:32,160 --> 02:00:35,760
No, because his team is the voices in his head.

3086
02:00:35,760 --> 02:00:41,440
I can take a picture of the vault and show it to them.

3087
02:00:41,440 --> 02:00:43,560
This is why you need to have me because I've

3088
02:00:43,560 --> 02:00:44,400
played all this shit.

3089
02:00:44,400 --> 02:00:46,520
Legitimate concern that you actually

3090
02:00:46,520 --> 02:00:48,760
may make a case for yourself to be on this show

3091
02:00:48,760 --> 02:00:51,040
and you will actually be on this program.

3092
02:00:51,040 --> 02:00:52,240
Look at this face.

3093
02:00:52,240 --> 02:00:53,440
Look at this adorable face.

3094
02:00:53,440 --> 02:00:54,840
I try not to.

3095
02:00:54,840 --> 02:00:55,520
Shut up.

3096
02:00:55,520 --> 02:00:56,520
I gave you ice cream.

3097
02:00:56,520 --> 02:00:57,680
Look at me.

3098
02:00:57,680 --> 02:00:58,240
I'm looking.

3099
02:00:58,240 --> 02:00:59,440
I'm looking.

3100
02:00:59,440 --> 02:01:01,160
I'm serious.

3101
02:01:01,160 --> 02:01:02,480
I am for real serious.

3102
02:01:02,480 --> 02:01:04,720
I want to be on the tester.

3103
02:01:04,720 --> 02:01:06,560
You do realize this is for a minimum wage

3104
02:01:06,560 --> 02:01:08,200
job in Santa Monica, right?

3105
02:01:08,200 --> 02:01:09,280
It could be.

3106
02:01:09,280 --> 02:01:12,320
But note that the Annie's up this season.

3107
02:01:12,320 --> 02:01:14,040
It's a production job this year.

3108
02:01:14,040 --> 02:01:15,200
Which means that I would be.

3109
02:01:15,200 --> 02:01:16,000
A production job.

3110
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:16,840
So what's that mean?

3111
02:01:16,840 --> 02:01:17,840
I'll put it this way.

3112
02:01:17,840 --> 02:01:21,600
Production is like, OK, like for a graphic designer,

3113
02:01:21,600 --> 02:01:27,320
production would be like color editing, color correction,

3114
02:01:27,320 --> 02:01:30,480
you know, adjusting textures, that type of thing.

3115
02:01:30,480 --> 02:01:31,920
Here's a bunch of spindles of disks.

3116
02:01:31,920 --> 02:01:32,920
Here's a bunch of cases.

3117
02:01:32,920 --> 02:01:35,240
We need you to produce the finished product.

3118
02:01:35,240 --> 02:01:37,280
No, that's not how it works.

3119
02:01:37,280 --> 02:01:40,480
Anyone that's in production is in like the actual building

3120
02:01:40,480 --> 02:01:42,400
part of the game, like you may be crunching numbers

3121
02:01:42,400 --> 02:01:43,960
or doing some data entry.

3122
02:01:43,960 --> 02:01:45,920
You know, it would be something that's

3123
02:01:45,920 --> 02:01:49,080
the equivalent of the job that I was just fucking doing.

3124
02:01:49,080 --> 02:01:51,440
Except I actually have skills to bring to the table.

3125
02:01:51,440 --> 02:01:53,760
They could put me to work in art production.

3126
02:01:53,760 --> 02:01:54,520
And guess what?

3127
02:01:54,520 --> 02:01:55,560
I would be good at it.

3128
02:01:55,560 --> 02:01:58,840
Because that's what I'm trying to do with my life.

3129
02:01:58,840 --> 02:02:00,320
You know what?

3130
02:02:00,320 --> 02:02:01,560
If I sign up for the tester.

3131
02:02:01,560 --> 02:02:02,160
What?

3132
02:02:02,160 --> 02:02:05,200
I'm going to do it in my costume.

3133
02:02:05,200 --> 02:02:07,600
Why are you people trying out for the tester?

3134
02:02:07,600 --> 02:02:09,560
You used to make fun of this show two years ago.

3135
02:02:09,560 --> 02:02:10,120
That's the whole point.

3136
02:02:10,120 --> 02:02:11,080
Don't you understand?

3137
02:02:11,080 --> 02:02:12,800
I need a job.

3138
02:02:12,800 --> 02:02:13,800
Don't you understand?

3139
02:02:13,800 --> 02:02:14,800
That's the whole point.

3140
02:02:14,800 --> 02:02:16,360
That's the funniest part about it.

3141
02:02:16,360 --> 02:02:18,800
What better way to get back at something

3142
02:02:18,800 --> 02:02:21,080
that you hate than to be part of it

3143
02:02:21,080 --> 02:02:23,880
and then be a complete asshole on it.

3144
02:02:23,880 --> 02:02:24,960
It would be awesome.

3145
02:02:24,960 --> 02:02:26,200
Rob, for real though.

3146
02:02:26,200 --> 02:02:27,400
I don't want to win.

3147
02:02:27,400 --> 02:02:30,440
I just want to be on the show.

3148
02:02:30,440 --> 02:02:32,720
And see, I want a job.

3149
02:02:32,720 --> 02:02:33,680
Thank you, Frisbee.

3150
02:02:33,680 --> 02:02:37,000
I want to be the very best that no one ever was.

3151
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:38,160
I want a job.

3152
02:02:38,160 --> 02:02:41,320
Hey, any of you people listening to the show, I'm talented.

3153
02:02:41,320 --> 02:02:42,920
Hire me.

3154
02:02:42,920 --> 02:02:46,840
Because honestly though, because I was thinking about it,

3155
02:02:46,840 --> 02:02:50,120
I would, if the job equivalency is what I'm thinking of,

3156
02:02:50,120 --> 02:02:52,200
I would be making about what I made at my old job.

3157
02:02:52,200 --> 02:02:55,480
Will you be able to tighten up the graphics on level three?

3158
02:02:55,480 --> 02:02:56,200
I could try.

3159
02:02:56,200 --> 02:02:56,680
OK.

3160
02:02:56,680 --> 02:02:57,200
No.

3161
02:02:57,200 --> 02:02:57,720
Hold on, hold on.

3162
02:02:57,720 --> 02:02:59,920
I want to just show dark soccer this real quick here.

3163
02:02:59,920 --> 02:03:01,600
Dark soccer, I just want to show you this.

3164
02:03:01,600 --> 02:03:03,720
11 elite gamers squared off to see

3165
02:03:03,720 --> 02:03:06,680
who had what it takes to be an official PlayStation game

3166
02:03:06,680 --> 02:03:07,200
tester.

3167
02:03:07,200 --> 02:03:09,160
Oh, no.

3168
02:03:09,160 --> 02:03:11,480
Cyrus, you've won.

3169
02:03:11,480 --> 02:03:14,360
Now it's time to usher in a new generation.

3170
02:03:14,360 --> 02:03:17,880
Welcome to the tester season two.

3171
02:03:17,880 --> 02:03:19,920
And this time, even you got to.

3172
02:03:19,920 --> 02:03:21,440
I mean, look at all those douchebags.

3173
02:03:21,440 --> 02:03:23,600
You really are going to have to team play with them.

3174
02:03:23,600 --> 02:03:25,080
You do know that, right?

3175
02:03:25,080 --> 02:03:30,560
Well, you see, as Rob, as one of superior intellect,

3176
02:03:30,560 --> 02:03:33,000
I would actually manipulate them into failure.

3177
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:34,520
Pick one of the contestants.

3178
02:03:34,520 --> 02:03:37,000
Congratulations, 8-Bit Mickey.

3179
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:38,840
These 12 gamers will be living together

3180
02:03:38,840 --> 02:03:39,840
in PlayStation Paradise.

3181
02:03:39,840 --> 02:03:41,600
Well, if that guy got voted in, you will, too.

3182
02:03:41,600 --> 02:03:44,360
I am one with the video games.

3183
02:03:44,360 --> 02:03:46,760
I want to hurt him so bad.

3184
02:03:46,760 --> 02:03:50,400
I'm going to dance with the tester to be the next PlayStation

3185
02:03:50,400 --> 02:03:51,400
game tester.

3186
02:03:51,400 --> 02:03:53,440
They had to do a dancing competition.

3187
02:03:53,440 --> 02:03:55,760
Are you going to do a dancing competition, Darzana?

3188
02:03:55,760 --> 02:03:57,960
I got rhythm.

3189
02:03:57,960 --> 02:03:59,280
I'll do a Para Para.

3190
02:03:59,280 --> 02:04:03,280
She didn't even miss a beat in saying that, I got rhythm.

3191
02:04:03,280 --> 02:04:04,080
Have you seen?

3192
02:04:04,080 --> 02:04:06,560
Now, this is hilarious, because Joystick

3193
02:04:06,560 --> 02:04:10,040
decided that they made casting videos for each one

3194
02:04:10,040 --> 02:04:11,400
of the people on their staff.

3195
02:04:11,400 --> 02:04:12,360
Nice.

3196
02:04:12,360 --> 02:04:12,920
Well played.

3197
02:04:12,920 --> 02:04:14,320
They have some really funny ones.

3198
02:04:14,320 --> 02:04:15,280
Well played.

3199
02:04:15,280 --> 02:04:18,720
No, seriously, Rob, I'll do Para Para.

3200
02:04:18,720 --> 02:04:20,800
It's fine.

3201
02:04:20,800 --> 02:04:21,960
I hope you get the job.

3202
02:04:21,960 --> 02:04:23,680
I legit hope you get the job.

3203
02:04:23,680 --> 02:04:27,440
Well, bring the video camera and show off my Baymani

3204
02:04:27,440 --> 02:04:31,160
and all this other quality PlayStation shit I have.

3205
02:04:31,160 --> 02:04:33,480
I mean, quality PlayStation products

3206
02:04:33,480 --> 02:04:36,160
that I've spent my good, hard-earned money on

3207
02:04:36,160 --> 02:04:39,080
and my first-generation PlayStation 3,

3208
02:04:39,080 --> 02:04:41,520
so I can say, look, Linux.

3209
02:04:41,520 --> 02:04:45,320
I mean, look, it plays PS1 games.

3210
02:04:45,320 --> 02:04:47,720
Zether is linking me to a YouTube saying,

3211
02:04:47,720 --> 02:04:49,320
this was a tester contestant.

3212
02:04:49,320 --> 02:04:50,600
I can't wait to see this here.

3213
02:04:50,600 --> 02:04:51,120
Let's see.

3214
02:04:51,120 --> 02:04:53,120
Watch out, they're coming through the window.

3215
02:04:53,120 --> 02:04:55,600
Watch out, they're coming through the window.

3216
02:04:55,600 --> 02:04:57,080
They're coming through the window.

3217
02:04:57,080 --> 02:04:58,080
Coming through the window.

3218
02:04:58,080 --> 02:04:59,080
Coming through the window.

3219
02:04:59,080 --> 02:05:00,560
Oh, I got a hell yeah.

3220
02:05:00,560 --> 02:05:03,840
Is that Rebecca Black?

3221
02:05:03,840 --> 02:05:07,600
Sure, yes, it's Rebecca Black, DarkSakura.

3222
02:05:07,600 --> 02:05:09,680
All grown up.

3223
02:05:09,680 --> 02:05:12,520
I just want to say, if you go on the show, that's going to be you.

3224
02:05:12,520 --> 02:05:14,720
Can we get a hey, they're coming through the window?

3225
02:05:14,720 --> 02:05:15,840
Come on, DarkSakura.

3226
02:05:15,840 --> 02:05:18,880
Bite my ass.

3227
02:05:18,880 --> 02:05:19,920
You're not a team player.

3228
02:05:19,920 --> 02:05:23,800
You lied when you said you were a team player.

3229
02:05:23,800 --> 02:05:28,720
All right, Loki, let's move on with some actual gaming news.

3230
02:05:28,720 --> 02:05:34,360
Maroon 5 has decided to join in the lawsuits

3231
02:05:34,360 --> 02:05:37,600
against Activision over Guitar Hero.

3232
02:05:37,600 --> 02:05:39,040
In this case, it's Band Hero.

3233
02:05:39,040 --> 02:05:42,400
He is suing because of Activision

3234
02:05:42,400 --> 02:05:45,520
improbably uses like this in Band Hero,

3235
02:05:45,520 --> 02:05:48,200
and you know the drill, OK?

3236
02:05:48,200 --> 02:05:50,120
He thought he was only singing his song,

3237
02:05:50,120 --> 02:05:52,160
but then he ended up singing all these songs,

3238
02:05:52,160 --> 02:05:56,800
and now he doesn't like that because it cheapens him

3239
02:05:56,800 --> 02:05:59,360
as an artist or some shit.

3240
02:05:59,360 --> 02:06:04,640
Being a judge on The Voice didn't already do that.

3241
02:06:04,640 --> 02:06:10,200
Yeah, it was great because he did the motion capture

3242
02:06:10,200 --> 02:06:12,760
to have his avatar used in the Band Hero song,

3243
02:06:12,760 --> 02:06:15,600
She Will Be Loved, but didn't give Activision permission

3244
02:06:15,600 --> 02:06:18,680
to use his likeness with other songs, which it totally did.

3245
02:06:18,680 --> 02:06:20,280
Déjà vu from like a year ago.

3246
02:06:20,280 --> 02:06:22,600
Levine alleges Activision asked other artists

3247
02:06:22,600 --> 02:06:24,120
for expanded use of their avatars

3248
02:06:24,120 --> 02:06:25,560
and paid them more for the process.

3249
02:06:28,840 --> 02:06:31,800
Wow, it's last year all over again.

3250
02:06:31,800 --> 02:06:33,720
Really?

3251
02:06:33,720 --> 02:06:35,000
Yeah.

3252
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:37,640
And of course, the same thing happened with No Doubt.

3253
02:06:37,640 --> 02:06:40,480
Do you think they just want a piece of the money as well?

3254
02:06:40,480 --> 02:06:43,120
I guess that's really what it's got to do with, huh?

3255
02:06:43,120 --> 02:06:44,320
I don't care.

3256
02:06:44,320 --> 02:06:45,480
I don't even care.

3257
02:06:45,480 --> 02:06:47,400
I mean, because boo fucking who?

3258
02:06:47,400 --> 02:06:48,400
Get over it.

3259
02:06:48,400 --> 02:06:49,400
I mean, seriously.

3260
02:06:49,400 --> 02:06:49,920
Oh, no.

3261
02:06:49,920 --> 02:06:55,840
You're in a game singing other people's songs in their voice.

3262
02:06:55,840 --> 02:06:57,040
It's an avatar.

3263
02:06:57,040 --> 02:06:57,960
Who cares?

3264
02:06:57,960 --> 02:07:00,720
No one made you like, no one drugged you up

3265
02:07:00,720 --> 02:07:04,520
and made you sing those songs on stage for like a live concert

3266
02:07:04,520 --> 02:07:05,480
or something like that.

3267
02:07:05,480 --> 02:07:11,520
It's a digital character, not really you.

3268
02:07:11,520 --> 02:07:14,320
I mean, they don't steal your soul and put it into the game.

3269
02:07:14,320 --> 02:07:17,680
I mean, unless you may think that's how it works,

3270
02:07:17,680 --> 02:07:18,960
it's not really you.

3271
02:07:18,960 --> 02:07:21,320
My art is my soul.

3272
02:07:21,320 --> 02:07:24,040
And when I sing a Miley Cyrus song in these games,

3273
02:07:24,040 --> 02:07:25,520
that's raping my art.

3274
02:07:28,520 --> 02:07:29,560
Well, here's the problem.

3275
02:07:29,560 --> 02:07:32,000
I did not want to hear anything about Miley Cyrus and rape.

3276
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,760
You put your songs into Band Hero.

3277
02:07:34,760 --> 02:07:39,160
Band Hero, which is the poppy version of Guitar Hero.

3278
02:07:39,160 --> 02:07:42,040
You should have really put your stuff in the Guitar Hero,

3279
02:07:42,040 --> 02:07:44,920
not Band Hero, or Rock Band.

3280
02:07:44,920 --> 02:07:48,040
Suck with Rock Band.

3281
02:07:48,040 --> 02:07:50,360
All right.

3282
02:07:50,360 --> 02:07:52,600
I don't know what to make of this next story.

3283
02:07:52,600 --> 02:07:55,040
Let's see what you guys think of it.

3284
02:07:55,040 --> 02:07:57,320
Let's see.

3285
02:07:57,320 --> 02:08:00,160
Pete Hines from Bethesda Softworks

3286
02:08:00,160 --> 02:08:03,120
figured that February 18th would be the perfect day

3287
02:08:03,120 --> 02:08:06,920
to conceive a child, as the baby would be due on November 11th,

3288
02:08:06,920 --> 02:08:12,160
which would be the ship date for the Elder Scrolls V Skyrim.

3289
02:08:12,160 --> 02:08:13,960
There's another couple, though, that

3290
02:08:13,960 --> 02:08:16,920
has conceived a little bit earlier than that.

3291
02:08:16,920 --> 02:08:17,440
Let's see.

3292
02:08:17,440 --> 02:08:21,840
Atari Lin, I guess, is the child,

3293
02:08:21,840 --> 02:08:27,480
decided to come out of the mom's womb

3294
02:08:27,480 --> 02:08:32,760
as mom and dad sat down for the half hour demo of the Bethesda

3295
02:08:32,760 --> 02:08:36,080
Skyrim demo at QuakeCon.

3296
02:08:36,080 --> 02:08:38,640
The father talked to Game Informer

3297
02:08:38,640 --> 02:08:41,840
that, I guess, the sight of the Frost Dragon on the screen

3298
02:08:41,840 --> 02:08:45,640
sent mom into labor.

3299
02:08:45,640 --> 02:08:49,240
The couple hung around, rather than dashing for the hospital,

3300
02:08:49,240 --> 02:08:52,160
because they thought it might be false labor.

3301
02:08:52,160 --> 02:08:54,480
And she loves Skyrim.

3302
02:08:57,440 --> 02:08:59,560
They named the baby, apparently, Atari Lin.

3303
02:09:03,560 --> 02:09:04,760
Dorks.

3304
02:09:04,760 --> 02:09:07,560
You know, they are one letter away from Atari Linx.

3305
02:09:07,560 --> 02:09:11,000
They made a baby.

3306
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:13,400
And they went into labor.

3307
02:09:13,400 --> 02:09:15,280
But they didn't go to the hospital right away.

3308
02:09:15,280 --> 02:09:16,880
So the baby drowned at the thing?

3309
02:09:16,880 --> 02:09:17,400
Yeah.

3310
02:09:17,400 --> 02:09:19,920
Well, they did want to miss the demo, Dark Soccer.

3311
02:09:19,920 --> 02:09:23,480
This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to see Skyrim.

3312
02:09:23,480 --> 02:09:25,560
You know, it's not a once in a lifetime opportunity,

3313
02:09:25,560 --> 02:09:29,320
because you can see the game when it comes out.

3314
02:09:29,320 --> 02:09:32,800
You know, Dark Soccer, you're not being a team player.

3315
02:09:32,800 --> 02:09:33,960
I'm not on his team.

3316
02:09:33,960 --> 02:09:37,120
I'm on the team of smart people.

3317
02:09:37,120 --> 02:09:41,240
Apparently, Kotaku, who first broke this story, so to speak,

3318
02:09:41,240 --> 02:09:43,480
was actually contacted by the mother.

3319
02:09:43,480 --> 02:09:45,920
They're saying that she's actually still in labor

3320
02:09:45,920 --> 02:09:47,120
and reading the comments.

3321
02:09:47,120 --> 02:09:50,000
But I guess they are still naming the baby Atari.

3322
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:52,400
The name Atari comes from the name Ataru,

3323
02:09:52,400 --> 02:09:54,200
which means to hit a target.

3324
02:09:54,200 --> 02:09:55,040
Yeah, they're just.

3325
02:09:55,040 --> 02:09:59,640
Yeah, that's what they named the baby after is to hit a target.

3326
02:09:59,640 --> 02:10:01,200
Ataru, hit a target.

3327
02:10:01,200 --> 02:10:02,920
This baby is going to be a bullet.

3328
02:10:02,920 --> 02:10:04,040
It's going to hit a target.

3329
02:10:04,040 --> 02:10:06,560
Not naming it after a game system

3330
02:10:06,560 --> 02:10:09,680
that these geeks obviously named their kid after.

3331
02:10:09,680 --> 02:10:12,560
They also do say, we assume by the time she's in high school,

3332
02:10:12,560 --> 02:10:14,040
most of the children her age are not

3333
02:10:14,040 --> 02:10:17,000
going to know what an Atari is.

3334
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:18,840
No, that's not true.

3335
02:10:18,840 --> 02:10:21,520
They should know.

3336
02:10:21,520 --> 02:10:23,600
That's not true.

3337
02:10:23,600 --> 02:10:25,520
Man, you know, it's just like, can you

3338
02:10:25,520 --> 02:10:28,080
imagine when the kid wants to know someday, like, you know,

3339
02:10:28,080 --> 02:10:29,680
tell me the story about how it was before.

3340
02:10:29,680 --> 02:10:31,520
That is so retarded.

3341
02:10:31,520 --> 02:10:33,080
I mean, seriously, oh, they're not

3342
02:10:33,080 --> 02:10:34,600
going to know what an Atari is.

3343
02:10:34,600 --> 02:10:35,080
Really?

3344
02:10:35,080 --> 02:10:38,480
Because children don't learn history?

3345
02:10:38,480 --> 02:10:42,000
Oh my god, what is, you know, the 13 colonies?

3346
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:44,960
I don't even know because I wasn't alive then.

3347
02:10:44,960 --> 02:10:49,920
Well, OK, name five movie stars from the 1940s.

3348
02:10:49,920 --> 02:10:52,040
Go.

3349
02:10:52,040 --> 02:10:53,480
I don't fucking watch movies.

3350
02:10:53,480 --> 02:10:56,360
See, you couldn't do it, so maybe they can't do it.

3351
02:10:56,360 --> 02:10:57,600
I don't know.

3352
02:10:57,600 --> 02:11:02,600
Maybe that's the thought behind it.

3353
02:11:02,600 --> 02:11:04,080
Uh, Fay Wray.

3354
02:11:04,080 --> 02:11:06,080
All right, let's shoot some of the 30s.

3355
02:11:06,080 --> 02:11:06,600
Shit.

3356
02:11:06,600 --> 02:11:07,520
Earn his Borg 9.

3357
02:11:07,520 --> 02:11:08,040
All right.

3358
02:11:08,040 --> 02:11:08,680
He's old enough.

3359
02:11:11,960 --> 02:11:15,160
Moving on, another story about Skyrim real quick.

3360
02:11:15,160 --> 02:11:17,720
I guess Skyrim, you know, it's going to cost $60,

3361
02:11:17,720 --> 02:11:19,680
but there hopefully will be like thousands

3362
02:11:19,680 --> 02:11:21,200
of hours of gameplay in this game

3363
02:11:21,200 --> 02:11:22,360
that make it worth the $60.

3364
02:11:22,360 --> 02:11:23,440
300 hours is what they're saying.

3365
02:11:23,440 --> 02:11:24,960
That's still pretty fucking good.

3366
02:11:24,960 --> 02:11:26,080
That is a long time.

3367
02:11:26,080 --> 02:11:26,880
That's a long time.

3368
02:11:26,880 --> 02:11:28,880
The original Oblivion was 100 hours.

3369
02:11:28,880 --> 02:11:32,080
So here's the interesting comment, though,

3370
02:11:32,080 --> 02:11:34,320
from Skyrim director Todd Howard.

3371
02:11:34,320 --> 02:11:37,480
It's speaking to PSM3, one of the magazines there.

3372
02:11:37,480 --> 02:11:40,800
I do think industry-wide we would benefit from more games

3373
02:11:40,800 --> 02:11:43,560
out at $19 or $29.

3374
02:11:43,560 --> 02:11:45,640
I would try more games because I'm not

3375
02:11:45,640 --> 02:11:47,400
going to try a game for $60.

3376
02:11:47,400 --> 02:11:48,920
It's a tough decision.

3377
02:11:48,920 --> 02:11:51,760
But then they went on to say that, yes, the $60 price

3378
02:11:51,760 --> 02:11:53,560
point is still what Skyrim's going to be at.

3379
02:11:53,560 --> 02:11:56,520
So there should be more games at $19 and $29,

3380
02:11:56,520 --> 02:11:59,160
but Skyrim's still $60, just so you know.

3381
02:11:59,160 --> 02:11:59,880
I hate to say it.

3382
02:11:59,880 --> 02:12:02,200
OK, all joking aside, the irony aside,

3383
02:12:02,200 --> 02:12:03,840
he kind of does have a point, though.

3384
02:12:03,840 --> 02:12:06,560
If games overall were kind of cheaper,

3385
02:12:06,560 --> 02:12:08,840
it wouldn't feel like such a loss to try a game at $19

3386
02:12:08,840 --> 02:12:09,560
or $29.

3387
02:12:09,560 --> 02:12:11,440
I think the fact of the matter is most games

3388
02:12:11,440 --> 02:12:12,840
aren't worth $60.

3389
02:12:12,840 --> 02:12:16,000
300 hours out of a game, I mean, that's

3390
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:17,680
unheard of in most cases.

3391
02:12:17,680 --> 02:12:22,560
If only there were a way to try games before you bought them,

3392
02:12:22,560 --> 02:12:28,120
we could call it rent team or demos.

3393
02:12:31,120 --> 02:12:34,880
If only such things existed in modern society,

3394
02:12:34,880 --> 02:12:38,440
but us being so barbaric, have not

3395
02:12:38,440 --> 02:12:42,920
had the foresight to create such wonderful implementations

3396
02:12:42,920 --> 02:12:46,880
of trials.

3397
02:12:46,880 --> 02:12:47,840
But yes, you're right.

3398
02:12:47,840 --> 02:12:50,840
We should tell the studios that spend millions of dollars

3399
02:12:50,840 --> 02:12:52,560
in production to, hey, you know what?

3400
02:12:52,560 --> 02:12:53,920
You need to put your game out for $2,

3401
02:12:53,920 --> 02:12:56,240
because no one's really going to buy it unless it's $2.

3402
02:12:59,680 --> 02:13:01,600
Well, on the iPhone, I mean, a lot of people

3403
02:13:01,600 --> 02:13:02,600
will buy games at $99.

3404
02:13:02,600 --> 02:13:04,040
Unless he puts out Skyrim for $19.99,

3405
02:13:04,040 --> 02:13:05,500
I don't fucking care what he wants.

3406
02:13:05,500 --> 02:13:07,960
Skyrim will be $19.99 in like three years

3407
02:13:07,960 --> 02:13:09,560
during the Steam sale.

3408
02:13:09,560 --> 02:13:12,600
Oblivion was on sale either yesterday or today.

3409
02:13:12,600 --> 02:13:14,960
Oh my god, it was like the super hello Uber edition

3410
02:13:14,960 --> 02:13:16,240
for like $10.

3411
02:13:16,240 --> 02:13:19,040
Like everything, everything that they ever put out

3412
02:13:19,040 --> 02:13:23,480
for Oblivion for like $10.

3413
02:13:23,480 --> 02:13:25,600
Anyhow, Dark Sakura, I know you're

3414
02:13:25,600 --> 02:13:27,560
working on your application, but do you have enough time

3415
02:13:27,560 --> 02:13:28,680
for another story for us?

3416
02:13:28,680 --> 02:13:30,240
I sure do.

3417
02:13:30,240 --> 02:13:33,000
Well, you know they just had the Evo tournament.

3418
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:34,560
Well, they're going to have to relearn

3419
02:13:34,560 --> 02:13:37,160
all their characters all over again, at least for Super

3420
02:13:37,160 --> 02:13:39,200
Street Fighter 4 arcade edition.

3421
02:13:39,200 --> 02:13:42,840
Patch is coming out that will rebalance the game.

3422
02:13:42,840 --> 02:13:45,360
So right now it's really imbalanced,

3423
02:13:45,360 --> 02:13:46,840
so they're hoping to fix it.

3424
02:13:46,840 --> 02:13:51,160
It's going to be version 2012.

3425
02:13:51,160 --> 02:13:52,840
And they did it outside of Evo.

3426
02:13:52,840 --> 02:13:56,880
Yoshinori Ono actually said that they've been location testing

3427
02:13:56,880 --> 02:14:00,040
the version in Japan.

3428
02:14:00,040 --> 02:14:02,200
So there, you don't have to buy it again.

3429
02:14:02,200 --> 02:14:04,960
You just have to download the patch.

3430
02:14:04,960 --> 02:14:07,120
Well, that's good that it's just a patch this time,

3431
02:14:07,120 --> 02:14:09,180
and yet not another way to milk more money out

3432
02:14:09,180 --> 02:14:10,800
of the same damn game as they've been doing

3433
02:14:10,800 --> 02:14:11,880
for the past three years.

3434
02:14:11,880 --> 02:14:14,720
I know right, I know right.

3435
02:14:14,720 --> 02:14:15,200
That's it.

3436
02:14:15,200 --> 02:14:16,200
All right.

3437
02:14:16,200 --> 02:14:17,640
Just a couple more stories for you guys,

3438
02:14:17,640 --> 02:14:21,080
and we're going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

3439
02:14:21,080 --> 02:14:23,080
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

3440
02:14:23,080 --> 02:14:24,760
And we'll get to your Twitter topics

3441
02:14:24,760 --> 02:14:27,080
as well at twitter.com slash O-L-R.

3442
02:14:27,080 --> 02:14:28,980
But first, a couple last stories for you.

3443
02:14:28,980 --> 02:14:29,480
Loki?

3444
02:14:32,120 --> 02:14:33,200
Loki?

3445
02:14:33,200 --> 02:14:33,680
OK.

3446
02:14:33,680 --> 02:14:35,560
Sorry.

3447
02:14:35,560 --> 02:14:36,640
So one last thing.

3448
02:14:36,640 --> 02:14:40,240
This is kind of interesting.

3449
02:14:40,240 --> 02:14:43,360
Remember how we talked about Pac-Man and Galaga dimensions

3450
02:14:43,360 --> 02:14:45,480
last week, and how they were kind of following suit

3451
02:14:45,480 --> 02:14:49,480
with what Capcom did with Resident Evil?

3452
02:14:49,480 --> 02:14:51,720
Thankfully, that wasn't the case, actually.

3453
02:14:51,720 --> 02:14:54,820
Namco Bandai came out and said, actually, there

3454
02:14:54,820 --> 02:14:59,000
is a way to reset your game saves on our game.

3455
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:01,560
And what you do is basically, upon startup,

3456
02:15:01,560 --> 02:15:05,200
players can input the command ABXYLR,

3457
02:15:05,200 --> 02:15:08,600
and it will wipe the save data from the cartridge.

3458
02:15:08,600 --> 02:15:12,560
How they should have done it on all the games.

3459
02:15:12,560 --> 02:15:15,840
Resident Evil Capcom.

3460
02:15:15,840 --> 02:15:18,240
But yeah.

3461
02:15:18,240 --> 02:15:21,080
So there was a secret code the whole time just hiding out

3462
02:15:21,080 --> 02:15:22,080
there behind the couch.

3463
02:15:22,080 --> 02:15:22,580
Who knew?

3464
02:15:22,580 --> 02:15:24,720
Yeah, unfortunately, that's not the case with Capcom's.

3465
02:15:24,720 --> 02:15:26,160
Do you think that might be one of those things

3466
02:15:26,160 --> 02:15:28,240
that they kind of announced it now just to kind of like cover

3467
02:15:28,240 --> 02:15:28,880
their ass?

3468
02:15:28,880 --> 02:15:31,760
Yeah, that's exactly why they did it.

3469
02:15:31,760 --> 02:15:32,480
Interesting.

3470
02:15:32,480 --> 02:15:34,600
Because everyone's like, phew, OK.

3471
02:15:34,600 --> 02:15:38,280
Maybe I will buy the game.

3472
02:15:38,280 --> 02:15:41,040
That's interesting, though, that there was kind of like,

3473
02:15:41,040 --> 02:15:43,360
this feature probably existed for the purposes

3474
02:15:43,360 --> 02:15:44,920
of like testing the game.

3475
02:15:44,920 --> 02:15:46,080
Dark Soccer, you might want to listen up,

3476
02:15:46,080 --> 02:15:47,200
because this could be your future career.

3477
02:15:47,200 --> 02:15:48,040
I am listening.

3478
02:15:48,040 --> 02:15:52,840
This could be something that was there for the testers

3479
02:15:52,840 --> 02:15:53,840
to use that they did.

3480
02:15:53,840 --> 02:15:55,920
Because sometimes that's where a lot of these codes

3481
02:15:55,920 --> 02:15:58,960
come from is like the play testing of the game, right?

3482
02:15:58,960 --> 02:15:59,880
Like a lot of those.

3483
02:15:59,880 --> 02:16:00,680
Like the Contra code.

3484
02:16:00,680 --> 02:16:04,480
Yeah, all that stuff came from like play testing and so forth.

3485
02:16:04,480 --> 02:16:06,840
So sometimes those codes kind of get out.

3486
02:16:06,840 --> 02:16:11,920
Maybe, just maybe, could one actually exist in the Capcom game?

3487
02:16:11,920 --> 02:16:13,520
I'm sure.

3488
02:16:13,520 --> 02:16:16,280
So maybe there's an A-B-X-Y-L-R type of thing

3489
02:16:16,280 --> 02:16:19,280
that maybe will save the day for Capcom, too?

3490
02:16:19,280 --> 02:16:20,960
Could possibly be, who knows?

3491
02:16:20,960 --> 02:16:22,720
Probably don't hold your breath, though, right?

3492
02:16:22,720 --> 02:16:25,760
Yeah, or else like you'd need like a dev system or something.

3493
02:16:25,760 --> 02:16:27,160
I don't know.

3494
02:16:27,160 --> 02:16:29,000
And I'm noticing this comment from our chat room.

3495
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:31,600
RDGSinge says, so are they backpedaling?

3496
02:16:31,600 --> 02:16:34,280
Do you consider this backpedaling, Loki?

3497
02:16:34,280 --> 02:16:38,680
No, because I don't really think they, I mean,

3498
02:16:38,680 --> 02:16:40,080
OK, maybe a little bit.

3499
02:16:40,080 --> 02:16:42,160
Just because they did say, well, the whole purpose

3500
02:16:42,160 --> 02:16:42,920
was to do that.

3501
02:16:42,920 --> 02:16:45,320
What they should have said, yeah, well, you know,

3502
02:16:45,320 --> 02:16:48,080
we originally wanted it to be that this

3503
02:16:48,080 --> 02:16:50,160
is kind of an arcade experience, and that's

3504
02:16:50,160 --> 02:16:51,640
why you don't have this.

3505
02:16:51,640 --> 02:16:54,840
But if you really do want to erase your save,

3506
02:16:54,840 --> 02:16:56,760
then here's how you go about and do it.

3507
02:16:56,760 --> 02:17:00,400
That would have been the proper response.

3508
02:17:00,400 --> 02:17:02,680
But instead, they said like, they

3509
02:17:02,680 --> 02:17:04,360
sent out something cryptic that looked

3510
02:17:04,360 --> 02:17:08,320
like trying to like crack a code from that horrible Nicolas

3511
02:17:08,320 --> 02:17:09,520
Cage movie or something.

3512
02:17:09,520 --> 02:17:11,320
Like, it's just like, what the hell is this?

3513
02:17:11,320 --> 02:17:13,320
Who's drunk at Namco right now?

3514
02:17:13,320 --> 02:17:14,840
But you know what, though?

3515
02:17:14,840 --> 02:17:17,320
In the end, all that matters is the end response,

3516
02:17:17,320 --> 02:17:21,320
and their game has a code, Capcom's doesn't.

3517
02:17:21,320 --> 02:17:24,520
So guess which one will be most likely purchased?

3518
02:17:24,520 --> 02:17:25,960
True enough.

3519
02:17:25,960 --> 02:17:27,600
I was on the fence about this game,

3520
02:17:27,600 --> 02:17:31,040
and now I'm back in the maybe I will buy it column.

3521
02:17:31,040 --> 02:17:32,960
Anyhow, one other story for you guys,

3522
02:17:32,960 --> 02:17:34,840
and I know some of you are looking forward to this game.

3523
02:17:34,840 --> 02:17:37,120
It's not a game I play a lot of, but I know a lot of you

3524
02:17:37,120 --> 02:17:39,080
play it, Modern Warfare 3.

3525
02:17:39,080 --> 02:17:40,980
Yeah, Modern Warfare 3 is coming out.

3526
02:17:40,980 --> 02:17:42,360
And I remember we were talking earlier

3527
02:17:42,360 --> 02:17:44,720
in the show about Activision Blizzard had a conference call.

3528
02:17:44,720 --> 02:17:47,200
Well, something they confirmed about Modern Warfare 3.

3529
02:17:47,200 --> 02:17:49,440
I know it's going to make some of you guys very happy,

3530
02:17:49,440 --> 02:17:50,720
some of you holdouts.

3531
02:17:50,720 --> 02:17:53,080
It's going to be available on the Wii.

3532
02:17:53,080 --> 02:17:53,760
That's right.

3533
02:17:53,760 --> 02:17:57,440
Check out that cutting edge graphics and technology

3534
02:17:57,440 --> 02:17:58,980
on the Wii.

3535
02:17:58,980 --> 02:18:01,960
Modern Warfare 3 is going to be available on the Wii

3536
02:18:01,960 --> 02:18:05,820
this holiday, apparently on November 8th,

3537
02:18:05,820 --> 02:18:08,020
right when all the other versions of the game come out.

3538
02:18:08,020 --> 02:18:10,480
And it's being made by Treyarch, of course,

3539
02:18:10,480 --> 02:18:13,980
who also made World of War, and Black Ops, and Call of Duty 3,

3540
02:18:13,980 --> 02:18:14,920
and so forth.

3541
02:18:14,920 --> 02:18:16,760
Yes, they are doing the Wii port as well,

3542
02:18:16,760 --> 02:18:20,640
since they have the experience working with that platform.

3543
02:18:20,640 --> 02:18:24,000
They did do Spider-Man, Web of Shadows.

3544
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:24,760
So there you go.

3545
02:18:24,760 --> 02:18:27,000
I'm sure tons of you are pre-ordering your copy.

3546
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:30,040
I'm sure that will be the way to play the game is on the Wii.

3547
02:18:30,040 --> 02:18:31,800
Am I right?

3548
02:18:31,800 --> 02:18:36,440
Modern Warfare 3 will be able to play online.

3549
02:18:36,440 --> 02:18:37,440
Wait, no.

3550
02:18:37,440 --> 02:18:38,920
You'll be able to play in HD.

3551
02:18:38,920 --> 02:18:40,280
Wait, no.

3552
02:18:40,280 --> 02:18:41,760
You'll be able to have the patch it.

3553
02:18:41,760 --> 02:18:43,400
Wait, no.

3554
02:18:43,400 --> 02:18:44,920
Well, somebody I'm sure out there

3555
02:18:44,920 --> 02:18:48,520
will benefit from Modern Warfare 3 being out there on the Wii.

3556
02:18:48,520 --> 02:18:53,040
Or as Zethur in the chat room is calling it, Modern Wii Fair.

3557
02:18:53,040 --> 02:18:54,040
I like that name for it.

3558
02:18:54,040 --> 02:18:55,400
It makes it sound cute.

3559
02:18:55,400 --> 02:18:58,240
Modern Wii Fair.

3560
02:18:58,240 --> 02:19:02,160
That sounds kind of like a personal problem.

3561
02:19:02,160 --> 02:19:03,240
Never mind.

3562
02:19:03,240 --> 02:19:06,960
All right, let's go to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

3563
02:19:06,960 --> 02:19:09,200
Or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

3564
02:19:09,200 --> 02:19:11,920
The Skype line is open right now.

3565
02:19:11,920 --> 02:19:13,320
But while we wait for some calls,

3566
02:19:13,320 --> 02:19:17,720
let's do some Twitter topics at twitter.com slash O-L-R.

3567
02:19:17,720 --> 02:19:20,040
I want to start from this one from TigerClaw305,

3568
02:19:20,040 --> 02:19:22,340
because it's news that we forgot to mention.

3569
02:19:22,340 --> 02:19:23,760
And I think it's kind of important.

3570
02:19:23,760 --> 02:19:26,600
Metroid turned 25 this week.

3571
02:19:26,600 --> 02:19:29,080
All the old NES games are turning 25, right?

3572
02:19:29,080 --> 02:19:30,240
Mario turned 25.

3573
02:19:30,240 --> 02:19:32,240
I think Zelda's 25 pretty soon.

3574
02:19:32,240 --> 02:19:34,880
Metroid as well, or Zelda did turn 25.

3575
02:19:34,880 --> 02:19:36,560
That was part of what they did at E3.

3576
02:19:36,560 --> 02:19:39,280
Metroid just turned 25 this past week.

3577
02:19:39,280 --> 02:19:40,520
Yay.

3578
02:19:40,520 --> 02:19:44,440
In related news, you're old.

3579
02:19:44,440 --> 02:19:47,200
Because I'm sure many of you have played Metroid in the past.

3580
02:19:47,200 --> 02:19:48,920
And that's now a 25-year-old game.

3581
02:19:48,920 --> 02:19:50,560
Dark Soccer, how does that make you feel

3582
02:19:50,560 --> 02:19:53,400
that Metroid is a 25-year-old game?

3583
02:19:53,400 --> 02:19:56,200
Perky.

3584
02:19:56,200 --> 02:19:59,120
Perky and full of ice cream.

3585
02:19:59,120 --> 02:20:01,320
Moving on to other tweets while we wait for some calls.

3586
02:20:01,320 --> 02:20:03,040
Again, the Skype line is open right now.

3587
02:20:03,040 --> 02:20:05,680
1877 to Game O-L-R, or as your name on Skype

3588
02:20:05,680 --> 02:20:06,680
is Orange Launch Radio.

3589
02:20:06,680 --> 02:20:08,400
Of course, right as I say that, we get some calls.

3590
02:20:08,400 --> 02:20:09,320
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

3591
02:20:09,320 --> 02:20:10,160
Who's this?

3592
02:20:10,160 --> 02:20:11,480
It's the one and only Ranma.

3593
02:20:11,480 --> 02:20:13,640
Hey, one and only Ranma, what's up?

3594
02:20:13,640 --> 02:20:15,320
Not too much.

3595
02:20:15,320 --> 02:20:18,280
I have a, not a question, but something

3596
02:20:18,280 --> 02:20:20,400
I want to discuss from a podcast a couple of weeks

3597
02:20:20,400 --> 02:20:22,400
ago, if we can rewind back just a bit.

3598
02:20:22,400 --> 02:20:24,360
I guess.

3599
02:20:24,360 --> 02:20:26,720
Well, I wanted to talk about it last week,

3600
02:20:26,720 --> 02:20:28,760
but it would have been too much for me to cover.

3601
02:20:28,760 --> 02:20:30,360
So you know, I have to spread it out.

3602
02:20:30,360 --> 02:20:31,520
Mm-hmm.

3603
02:20:31,520 --> 02:20:32,160
Yeah.

3604
02:20:32,160 --> 02:20:34,800
So if you remember, a couple of weeks ago,

3605
02:20:34,800 --> 02:20:39,320
you posted on your profile an article about sports games.

3606
02:20:39,320 --> 02:20:40,560
Yes.

3607
02:20:40,560 --> 02:20:42,080
Now, I was thinking about that.

3608
02:20:42,080 --> 02:20:43,960
And it's like how the person said

3609
02:20:43,960 --> 02:20:48,000
that you could say Mario Kart is also a sports game.

3610
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:49,640
OK, I do remember this.

3611
02:20:49,640 --> 02:20:51,320
Wasn't it the whole article about don't

3612
02:20:51,320 --> 02:20:54,000
be so harsh on sports games because sometimes they're

3613
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:56,400
kind of leading the way for other series of games?

3614
02:20:56,400 --> 02:20:57,120
I remember this.

3615
02:20:57,120 --> 02:20:58,080
OK.

3616
02:20:58,080 --> 02:20:59,480
Yeah, pretty much.

3617
02:20:59,480 --> 02:21:02,840
And I was thinking, well, I guess in my opinion,

3618
02:21:02,840 --> 02:21:07,520
you can't say that Mario Kart is a sports game.

3619
02:21:07,520 --> 02:21:12,680
That's like saying WWE is actual legitimate wrestling.

3620
02:21:12,680 --> 02:21:14,080
But to some it is.

3621
02:21:14,080 --> 02:21:16,240
I mean, couldn't Mario, isn't Mario Kart something

3622
02:21:16,240 --> 02:21:19,440
you might see on The Oat Show?

3623
02:21:19,440 --> 02:21:22,520
ESPN 8?

3624
02:21:22,520 --> 02:21:26,120
Have you ever looked at ESPN 3?

3625
02:21:26,120 --> 02:21:28,680
Some of that shit isn't sports either.

3626
02:21:28,680 --> 02:21:30,040
True, true.

3627
02:21:30,040 --> 02:21:33,560
But it's like most of the sports games,

3628
02:21:33,560 --> 02:21:35,760
you have to have a bit of a learning curve.

3629
02:21:35,760 --> 02:21:38,120
You have to study the manual so you

3630
02:21:38,120 --> 02:21:40,720
know what you're doing with all the buttons, whereas with games

3631
02:21:40,720 --> 02:21:44,120
like Mario Kart and any of the Mario titles,

3632
02:21:44,120 --> 02:21:45,960
you just pick up the game and start playing.

3633
02:21:45,960 --> 02:21:48,480
You don't have to learn any strategies or tactics

3634
02:21:48,480 --> 02:21:49,360
or anything like that.

3635
02:21:49,360 --> 02:21:52,240
It's like a pick up and play.

3636
02:21:52,240 --> 02:21:55,000
I mean, I do understand that it can be considered a sports

3637
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:58,000
title, but on the same token, it's not because it's just

3638
02:21:58,000 --> 02:21:59,720
a fun game to pick up and play.

3639
02:21:59,720 --> 02:22:02,880
I mean, a lot of sports games you can pick up and play too,

3640
02:22:02,880 --> 02:22:04,320
especially the old school ones.

3641
02:22:04,320 --> 02:22:05,840
OK, what's the goal of basketball?

3642
02:22:05,840 --> 02:22:06,880
Throw ball in net?

3643
02:22:06,880 --> 02:22:07,960
All right, I can do that.

3644
02:22:07,960 --> 02:22:08,440
Let's go.

3645
02:22:08,440 --> 02:22:10,440
Of course, of course.

3646
02:22:10,440 --> 02:22:11,680
Look at Tecmo Bowl.

3647
02:22:11,680 --> 02:22:14,400
I mean, yeah, that was a sports game, but on the same token,

3648
02:22:14,400 --> 02:22:14,880
it wasn't.

3649
02:22:14,880 --> 02:22:17,840
All you had to do was push in the command for your play,

3650
02:22:17,840 --> 02:22:19,880
hit the button, and that was it.

3651
02:22:19,880 --> 02:22:22,600
It was amazing and awesome.

3652
02:22:22,600 --> 02:22:26,200
Yes, yes, it was.

3653
02:22:26,200 --> 02:22:29,000
So you just called in a bitch about how Mario Kart Wii is not

3654
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:30,400
a sport.

3655
02:22:30,400 --> 02:22:33,160
More or less, but I understand where the person's coming from,

3656
02:22:33,160 --> 02:22:34,960
but I guess from the way I look at it,

3657
02:22:34,960 --> 02:22:38,560
it's not really a sports title, even though it

3658
02:22:38,560 --> 02:22:41,760
can be considered that, but I'm just saying that's my opinion.

3659
02:22:41,760 --> 02:22:43,640
Fine, it's not a sports title.

3660
02:22:43,640 --> 02:22:45,400
Now what?

3661
02:22:45,400 --> 02:22:47,560
It's a family fun game.

3662
02:22:47,560 --> 02:22:50,640
That's what you call it, you know?

3663
02:22:50,640 --> 02:22:55,000
I'm just saying, whereas most of the sports games that EA puts

3664
02:22:55,000 --> 02:22:58,560
out, you have to learn the insides and outs of it

3665
02:22:58,560 --> 02:23:02,920
to play it really well, whereas there are other games that

3666
02:23:02,920 --> 02:23:04,760
are sports games, but you don't need

3667
02:23:04,760 --> 02:23:07,280
to learn the insides and outs.

3668
02:23:07,280 --> 02:23:09,360
You just need to know what the buttons do and just

3669
02:23:09,360 --> 02:23:12,400
start playing, and that's it.

3670
02:23:12,400 --> 02:23:15,000
All right, fair enough.

3671
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:16,440
Anything else on your mind?

3672
02:23:16,440 --> 02:23:18,240
Yeah, you should try out for the test or two.

3673
02:23:18,240 --> 02:23:19,880
I'm not trying out for the test or two.

3674
02:23:19,880 --> 02:23:20,840
You could be Rob.

3675
02:23:20,840 --> 02:23:22,400
I'm fucking fabulous, bitches.

3676
02:23:22,400 --> 02:23:22,960
Roberts.

3677
02:23:22,960 --> 02:23:24,560
A gay guy won last season.

3678
02:23:24,560 --> 02:23:26,720
They're not going to win two seasons in a row.

3679
02:23:26,720 --> 02:23:28,120
Hey, it could happen.

3680
02:23:28,120 --> 02:23:29,480
I may start a revolution.

3681
02:23:29,480 --> 02:23:31,640
Come on, now.

3682
02:23:31,640 --> 02:23:33,040
No, it's not.

3683
02:23:33,040 --> 02:23:36,400
You can win it and just walk up and win it two snaps up

3684
02:23:36,400 --> 02:23:37,960
in a b-money formation.

3685
02:23:37,960 --> 02:23:39,400
It's time for a girl to win.

3686
02:23:39,400 --> 02:23:41,200
But won't you vote for me?

3687
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:45,000
You made her cry.

3688
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:45,600
Way to go.

3689
02:23:45,600 --> 02:23:46,520
That's on you, buddy.

3690
02:23:46,520 --> 02:23:48,400
You're not a team player.

3691
02:23:48,400 --> 02:23:49,320
Look, hold it.

3692
02:23:49,320 --> 02:23:49,840
Back it up.

3693
02:23:49,840 --> 02:23:51,280
Back it up here.

3694
02:23:51,280 --> 02:23:56,360
Just so you know, I always have the back of Jamie, Loki,

3695
02:23:56,360 --> 02:23:57,080
and Rob, always.

3696
02:23:57,080 --> 02:23:59,200
But no matter what, I always vote for Jamie

3697
02:23:59,200 --> 02:24:01,320
because Jamie's the number one.

3698
02:24:01,320 --> 02:24:02,280
Simple as that.

3699
02:24:02,280 --> 02:24:04,200
I always got Ucchan's back, no matter what.

3700
02:24:04,200 --> 02:24:04,680
Oh, I see.

3701
02:24:04,680 --> 02:24:06,080
Now, oh, I see.

3702
02:24:06,080 --> 02:24:09,640
Now we've ranked the OLR hosts from most desirable

3703
02:24:09,640 --> 02:24:10,480
to least desirable.

3704
02:24:10,480 --> 02:24:13,080
Well, I am the cutest.

3705
02:24:13,080 --> 02:24:14,200
No, I'm the cutest.

3706
02:24:14,200 --> 02:24:17,640
And she put up with me for a weekend.

3707
02:24:17,640 --> 02:24:19,520
I mean, that alone deserves a trophy.

3708
02:24:19,520 --> 02:24:22,440
And I've got the best rack of anyone in this room.

3709
02:24:22,440 --> 02:24:24,120
Well, no, maybe Loki's is better.

3710
02:24:24,120 --> 02:24:27,280
Rama, I'm the cutest.

3711
02:24:27,280 --> 02:24:30,400
You're more like the fabulous.

3712
02:24:30,400 --> 02:24:31,120
Fine.

3713
02:24:31,120 --> 02:24:32,880
I'm fabulous and cute.

3714
02:24:32,880 --> 02:24:33,880
All right, bye.

3715
02:24:33,880 --> 02:24:35,720
Bye.

3716
02:24:35,720 --> 02:24:36,760
Let's take another call.

3717
02:24:36,760 --> 02:24:37,560
I'm done with Rama.

3718
02:24:37,560 --> 02:24:39,020
Hi, you're on Orange Laundry Radio.

3719
02:24:39,020 --> 02:24:40,200
Who's this?

3720
02:24:40,200 --> 02:24:42,240
The Werenate.

3721
02:24:42,240 --> 02:24:43,400
What's the name?

3722
02:24:43,400 --> 02:24:44,240
The Werenate.

3723
02:24:44,240 --> 02:24:45,080
The Werenate.

3724
02:24:45,080 --> 02:24:46,480
What's up?

3725
02:24:46,480 --> 02:24:48,640
Yeah, I was calling because I want

3726
02:24:48,640 --> 02:24:51,840
to comment on your Modern Warfare 3.

3727
02:24:51,840 --> 02:24:54,680
Oh, you're going to be pre-ordering on the Wii?

3728
02:24:54,680 --> 02:24:57,280
Most likely.

3729
02:24:57,280 --> 02:24:58,000
Sucker.

3730
02:24:58,000 --> 02:24:58,720
Why is that?

3731
02:24:58,720 --> 02:25:00,600
Is that all you got?

3732
02:25:00,600 --> 02:25:03,920
Yeah, because I'm a diehard Nintendo fan.

3733
02:25:03,920 --> 02:25:06,440
Long live Nintendo.

3734
02:25:06,440 --> 02:25:09,680
And also, I mean, I played Modern Warfare 1 on the Wii.

3735
02:25:09,680 --> 02:25:10,640
And it was pretty nice.

3736
02:25:10,640 --> 02:25:11,520
It had online play.

3737
02:25:11,520 --> 02:25:13,280
Why are you saying it won't have online play?

3738
02:25:13,280 --> 02:25:15,120
You've got to do the waggle.

3739
02:25:15,120 --> 02:25:18,200
I'm just, it'll have online play.

3740
02:25:18,200 --> 02:25:21,200
But it's not going to be as robust as with the voice

3741
02:25:21,200 --> 02:25:23,480
chat and all that to say something like Xbox Live

3742
02:25:23,480 --> 02:25:24,680
or PlayStation Network.

3743
02:25:24,680 --> 02:25:27,360
It'll just be, which might actually, to be fair,

3744
02:25:27,360 --> 02:25:28,320
might be for the best.

3745
02:25:28,320 --> 02:25:30,680
Because you don't want to play those games on Xbox Live

3746
02:25:30,680 --> 02:25:32,160
because people are just rude.

3747
02:25:32,160 --> 02:25:35,360
I mean, if you shoot someone or blow their head off

3748
02:25:35,360 --> 02:25:37,520
in real life, do you want to have voice chat with them

3749
02:25:37,520 --> 02:25:40,680
or you just want to get the job done?

3750
02:25:40,680 --> 02:25:41,560
Touche.

3751
02:25:41,560 --> 02:25:42,320
Fine.

3752
02:25:42,320 --> 02:25:43,920
The caller has a point.

3753
02:25:43,920 --> 02:25:45,040
I stand corrected.

3754
02:25:45,040 --> 02:25:47,880
Yes, I do want to have voice chat with them.

3755
02:25:47,880 --> 02:25:48,920
Excuse me.

3756
02:25:48,920 --> 02:25:51,640
I don't like the fact very much that you just blew off my head.

3757
02:25:51,640 --> 02:25:54,640
I think you should promptly apologize for that, actually.

3758
02:25:54,640 --> 02:25:57,680
Yeah, you know, so I'm a Wii user,

3759
02:25:57,680 --> 02:25:59,960
but I can't wait for the Wii U. You know,

3760
02:25:59,960 --> 02:26:02,680
I think you all should be glorifying the Wii U,

3761
02:26:02,680 --> 02:26:05,400
because it's going to be a pretty epic system.

3762
02:26:05,400 --> 02:26:08,080
Not until we see the games.

3763
02:26:08,080 --> 02:26:09,840
What we saw at E3 wasn't enough.

3764
02:26:09,840 --> 02:26:12,040
A system is only as good as the games that are on it.

3765
02:26:12,040 --> 02:26:14,440
And I am not convinced yet.

3766
02:26:14,440 --> 02:26:16,920
I mean, yes, they talked about some of these third party games,

3767
02:26:16,920 --> 02:26:18,800
but they talked about games that are already

3768
02:26:18,800 --> 02:26:21,720
coming out this holiday that might not even really end up

3769
02:26:21,720 --> 02:26:22,560
in their same form.

3770
02:26:22,560 --> 02:26:24,680
Like, they talked about the Assassin's Creed game

3771
02:26:24,680 --> 02:26:26,560
is not the same game that's coming out

3772
02:26:26,560 --> 02:26:29,000
this holiday for the other systems, like a separate game.

3773
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:32,320
So I'm not sold one way or the other on Wii U.

3774
02:26:32,320 --> 02:26:34,960
I mean, I'll probably buy one at launch

3775
02:26:34,960 --> 02:26:39,080
because I buy every other system at launch, but.

3776
02:26:39,080 --> 02:26:40,480
Do you now see the tech demos?

3777
02:26:40,480 --> 02:26:43,320
I mean, come on, it had like tech in on it.

3778
02:26:43,320 --> 02:26:44,160
Come on.

3779
02:26:44,160 --> 02:26:48,400
It's going to be changing to more hardcore.

3780
02:26:48,400 --> 02:26:50,840
You suddenly sound like you're underwater, but that's all right.

3781
02:26:50,840 --> 02:26:52,000
Dalek voice.

3782
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:54,320
Yes, he's got the Dalek voice going on.

3783
02:26:54,320 --> 02:26:58,240
But I don't know.

3784
02:26:58,240 --> 02:27:03,760
The demos, it's interesting, but let me ask you this.

3785
02:27:03,760 --> 02:27:06,000
Can't the Vita and the PlayStation 3

3786
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:10,560
essentially do the same thing?

3787
02:27:10,560 --> 02:27:19,080
I'm almost muted, but the Vita is not even better than a 3DS.

3788
02:27:19,080 --> 02:27:23,200
Well, it's got, well, I don't know about that.

3789
02:27:23,200 --> 02:27:24,280
It's kind of relative.

3790
02:27:24,280 --> 02:27:26,200
It depends on what games it gets.

3791
02:27:26,200 --> 02:27:27,800
I don't know about the processors.

3792
02:27:27,800 --> 02:27:31,880
Put them side by side, but I imagine that, sorry,

3793
02:27:31,880 --> 02:27:34,560
Loki showing off his cheating in his game.

3794
02:27:34,560 --> 02:27:39,000
He's cheating, getting 5 million tower bucks from cheating.

3795
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:41,400
That's a lot cheaper than buying that.

3796
02:27:41,400 --> 02:27:42,360
Anyway, sorry.

3797
02:27:42,360 --> 02:27:47,960
I would like to say that I hope that the re-ware is more,

3798
02:27:47,960 --> 02:27:49,360
is better than what it is now.

3799
02:27:49,360 --> 02:27:52,560
Because as a developer, I hope that I

3800
02:27:52,560 --> 02:27:56,120
can see some better games besides that roller skating

3801
02:27:56,120 --> 02:27:58,960
game and roller goo on there.

3802
02:27:58,960 --> 02:28:01,200
And the one with the guys in the Speedos

3803
02:28:01,200 --> 02:28:03,440
trying to get through the walls, that was a real fun game,

3804
02:28:03,440 --> 02:28:04,440
actually.

3805
02:28:04,440 --> 02:28:07,000
No, I'm glad you can say something critical

3806
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:09,120
about Nintendo, because I was getting a little worried

3807
02:28:09,120 --> 02:28:10,880
that you were a little bit too much fanboy.

3808
02:28:10,880 --> 02:28:12,080
But yes, I agree.

3809
02:28:12,080 --> 02:28:14,680
They're online as a whole really needs to improve.

3810
02:28:14,680 --> 02:28:15,560
So I hope they do it.

3811
02:28:15,560 --> 02:28:18,440
But I will say the 3DS has done some things right online.

3812
02:28:18,440 --> 02:28:19,640
So we'll see.

3813
02:28:19,640 --> 02:28:23,960
I don't have one yet, but you can save me one if you want.

3814
02:28:23,960 --> 02:28:24,560
We'll see.

3815
02:28:24,560 --> 02:28:26,400
We might have a contest around the holidays.

3816
02:28:26,400 --> 02:28:26,920
All right.

3817
02:28:26,920 --> 02:28:29,200
Anyhow, I got to let you go so we can get more calls.

3818
02:28:29,200 --> 02:28:30,400
But thanks for the input.

3819
02:28:30,400 --> 02:28:31,080
Take care, buddy.

3820
02:28:31,080 --> 02:28:31,880
Rene signing out.

3821
02:28:31,880 --> 02:28:33,360
Later.

3822
02:28:33,360 --> 02:28:34,680
Let's take another call here.

3823
02:28:34,680 --> 02:28:36,020
Hi, you're on Orange Dogs Radio.

3824
02:28:36,020 --> 02:28:36,960
Who's this?

3825
02:28:36,960 --> 02:28:37,480
Yo, guys.

3826
02:28:37,480 --> 02:28:38,960
It's Xenocore from the OKC.

3827
02:28:38,960 --> 02:28:39,520
How you doing?

3828
02:28:39,520 --> 02:28:41,720
What is up, Xenocore from OKC?

3829
02:28:41,720 --> 02:28:43,240
What's in your mind tonight?

3830
02:28:43,240 --> 02:28:43,720
Not much.

3831
02:28:43,720 --> 02:28:47,200
Just been playing a bit of Earth Defense Force 2011.

3832
02:28:47,200 --> 02:28:49,600
Oh, a game that's near and dear to Loki's heart.

3833
02:28:49,600 --> 02:28:51,200
What do you think?

3834
02:28:51,200 --> 02:28:53,240
It's not bad, but I'm not even sure

3835
02:28:53,240 --> 02:28:54,480
if the game has an ending yet.

3836
02:28:54,480 --> 02:28:56,920
I've been playing it online so I can have some backup.

3837
02:28:56,920 --> 02:29:01,440
And every time it gets to the last minute, it just resets.

3838
02:29:01,440 --> 02:29:03,360
Loki, is this a problem?

3839
02:29:03,360 --> 02:29:06,640
Well, the very last mission, I mean,

3840
02:29:06,640 --> 02:29:08,560
depends on what difficulty you're playing on.

3841
02:29:08,560 --> 02:29:12,840
The ending's not very long.

3842
02:29:12,840 --> 02:29:15,000
Well, I never think the ending would be that long.

3843
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:17,160
In this whole game, it's the gameplay itself.

3844
02:29:17,160 --> 02:29:19,480
But I do at least want to know what the hell happened,

3845
02:29:19,480 --> 02:29:21,960
because it's just like all your characters have vanished.

3846
02:29:21,960 --> 02:29:23,880
Yeah, you just have to play it on a harder difficulty,

3847
02:29:23,880 --> 02:29:26,640
because each time you beat the game on a harder difficulty,

3848
02:29:26,640 --> 02:29:28,440
the ending's longer and longer.

3849
02:29:28,440 --> 02:29:28,940
OK.

3850
02:29:28,940 --> 02:29:30,320
It would have been nice if they'd

3851
02:29:30,320 --> 02:29:32,200
be some sort of a hint, like, play this on a harder

3852
02:29:32,200 --> 02:29:34,680
difficulty to find out what happens or something like that.

3853
02:29:34,680 --> 02:29:39,440
Well, I think they also have DLC coming, so it's hard to say

3854
02:29:39,440 --> 02:29:40,800
what exactly they'll be having.

3855
02:29:40,800 --> 02:29:41,280
Let's see.

3856
02:29:41,280 --> 02:29:45,280
And I've been playing the hell out of 4K Kill Team as well.

3857
02:29:45,280 --> 02:29:47,360
You're cutting in and out a little bit there,

3858
02:29:47,360 --> 02:29:48,320
but that's all right.

3859
02:29:48,320 --> 02:29:50,680
You've been playing the hell out of what?

3860
02:29:50,680 --> 02:29:52,600
Warhammer 40,000 Kill Team.

3861
02:29:52,600 --> 02:29:54,600
Oh, didn't you mention this game on an earlier

3862
02:29:54,600 --> 02:29:55,440
episode of the show?

3863
02:29:55,440 --> 02:29:56,360
I think you did.

3864
02:29:56,360 --> 02:29:58,360
Yeah, I finally grabbed the whole thing.

3865
02:29:58,360 --> 02:30:02,400
It's not bad for 10 bucks, definitely worth the money.

3866
02:30:02,400 --> 02:30:03,840
Might have to look into that.

3867
02:30:03,840 --> 02:30:05,920
What else have you been playing, anything else?

3868
02:30:05,920 --> 02:30:07,320
No, that's about it.

3869
02:30:07,320 --> 02:30:09,480
Trying to save some money.

3870
02:30:09,480 --> 02:30:11,240
Any new stories you want to talk about tonight

3871
02:30:11,240 --> 02:30:12,880
that we talked about on the show?

3872
02:30:12,880 --> 02:30:14,800
Well, I did want to comment on the whole thing

3873
02:30:14,800 --> 02:30:19,680
about the Diablo III going online only,

3874
02:30:19,680 --> 02:30:22,200
and what company aspects of that are.

3875
02:30:22,200 --> 02:30:22,840
Go ahead.

3876
02:30:22,840 --> 02:30:24,120
You're still cutting in and out a little bit.

3877
02:30:24,120 --> 02:30:25,320
I don't know what's going on with the connection,

3878
02:30:25,320 --> 02:30:27,040
but I'll let you get your thought out there.

3879
02:30:27,040 --> 02:30:29,320
I can understand you enough.

3880
02:30:29,320 --> 02:30:32,080
Blizzard knows that everything is possible with code.

3881
02:30:32,080 --> 02:30:34,760
All they need is time.

3882
02:30:34,760 --> 02:30:37,840
Granted, they do have to do something for copy protection,

3883
02:30:37,840 --> 02:30:43,160
but honestly, if they think this is going to stop anything,

3884
02:30:43,160 --> 02:30:45,800
then they really need to go get their coding team

3885
02:30:45,800 --> 02:30:47,600
and re-evaluate who's working for them,

3886
02:30:47,600 --> 02:30:50,520
because whoever told me that this is going to defeat

3887
02:30:50,520 --> 02:30:53,880
online hacking is ridiculous, because it happens.

3888
02:30:53,880 --> 02:30:56,560
Well, the Warcraft right now looks right.

3889
02:30:56,560 --> 02:30:59,040
That's true, but they ban players from World of Warcraft

3890
02:30:59,040 --> 02:31:00,440
left and right, too, right?

3891
02:31:00,440 --> 02:31:02,800
Yeah, but that won't keep them from getting back in the game.

3892
02:31:02,800 --> 02:31:03,680
I guess that's true.

3893
02:31:03,680 --> 02:31:04,760
What about StarCraft II?

3894
02:31:04,760 --> 02:31:06,040
What are the issues that that game's having?

3895
02:31:06,040 --> 02:31:07,120
Are they having issues, too?

3896
02:31:07,120 --> 02:31:08,480
I guess, but I guess you don't know.

3897
02:31:08,480 --> 02:31:09,800
Well, they have their own variety of issues.

3898
02:31:09,800 --> 02:31:12,600
It's not so much because there's no real persistence

3899
02:31:12,600 --> 02:31:14,520
in the game, other than you think,

3900
02:31:14,520 --> 02:31:17,080
but you'll see people do lag hacks and stuff

3901
02:31:17,080 --> 02:31:19,720
to interfere with the other player's game.

3902
02:31:19,720 --> 02:31:21,280
Remove the fog of wars, you can see

3903
02:31:21,280 --> 02:31:23,680
what your player is doing without having you nearby.

3904
02:31:23,680 --> 02:31:26,320
More gameplay hacks more than anything else.

3905
02:31:26,320 --> 02:31:28,760
And it's even more critical to the play of the game,

3906
02:31:28,760 --> 02:31:31,920
so it does more damage.

3907
02:31:31,920 --> 02:31:35,880
I am very curious to see just how legally this all plays out,

3908
02:31:35,880 --> 02:31:37,960
especially when the first exploit does come down

3909
02:31:37,960 --> 02:31:40,200
the hill, and then suddenly it's impacting the real money

3910
02:31:40,200 --> 02:31:41,120
trading house.

3911
02:31:41,120 --> 02:31:42,960
They've got to be thinking of something.

3912
02:31:42,960 --> 02:31:45,360
There's got to be something in place they're doing.

3913
02:31:45,360 --> 02:31:47,040
I mean, they're swearing up and down

3914
02:31:47,040 --> 02:31:49,160
that they've looked at it from a legal perspective,

3915
02:31:49,160 --> 02:31:52,200
but just because it's totally legal right now, too,

3916
02:31:52,200 --> 02:31:54,880
doesn't mean it will always be legal.

3917
02:31:54,880 --> 02:31:56,560
That's the other thing I kind of worry about with them.

3918
02:31:56,560 --> 02:31:58,800
Especially when they have, the main thing

3919
02:31:58,800 --> 02:32:00,880
is between Second Life and this.

3920
02:32:00,880 --> 02:32:04,000
Second Life, people are making the assets themselves.

3921
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:06,320
The game isn't supplying them with the assets.

3922
02:32:06,320 --> 02:32:07,840
If you supply them with the assets,

3923
02:32:07,840 --> 02:32:09,880
technically Blizzard still owns them.

3924
02:32:09,880 --> 02:32:12,640
At Second Life, you have rights to whatever you create.

3925
02:32:14,200 --> 02:32:16,320
That's interesting, you're just kind of paying.

3926
02:32:16,320 --> 02:32:18,840
It's going to be very, very strange what happens with it,

3927
02:32:18,840 --> 02:32:20,580
but we'll see what happens once the politicians

3928
02:32:20,580 --> 02:32:21,920
pull their heads out their asses.

3929
02:32:21,920 --> 02:32:24,040
Blizzard is going to be printing money with this.

3930
02:32:24,040 --> 02:32:24,880
It's going to be very interesting.

3931
02:32:24,880 --> 02:32:26,160
All right, Xenocore, I got to let you go.

3932
02:32:26,160 --> 02:32:28,880
Skype's acting up, so take care, buddy, okay?

3933
02:32:28,880 --> 02:32:29,720
All right, later, man.

3934
02:32:29,720 --> 02:32:30,880
Have a good one.

3935
02:32:30,880 --> 02:32:33,280
All right, thank you, listeners.

3936
02:32:33,280 --> 02:32:34,540
I wanted to hear his thoughts on that,

3937
02:32:34,540 --> 02:32:35,640
and I know he's cutting in and out.

3938
02:32:35,640 --> 02:32:36,460
It's probably a little annoying,

3939
02:32:36,460 --> 02:32:37,300
but I wanted to hear what,

3940
02:32:37,300 --> 02:32:38,720
I was able to understand most of it.

3941
02:32:38,720 --> 02:32:39,640
Let me go back to Twitter,

3942
02:32:39,640 --> 02:32:40,640
because I got to get through some more

3943
02:32:40,640 --> 02:32:41,700
of these Twitter topics here,

3944
02:32:41,700 --> 02:32:43,080
and then I'll see if any more calls

3945
02:32:43,080 --> 02:32:44,480
are coming in at that point.

3946
02:32:45,560 --> 02:32:49,640
More Twitter topics at twitter.com slash O-L-R

3947
02:32:49,640 --> 02:32:51,080
as I load them up here.

3948
02:32:51,080 --> 02:32:54,240
Let's see, we actually don't have a whole lot tonight.

3949
02:32:54,240 --> 02:32:55,640
Let me go to,

3950
02:32:57,880 --> 02:32:58,900
Retertainment says,

3951
02:32:58,900 --> 02:33:00,040
I meant to email you,

3952
02:33:00,040 --> 02:33:03,160
but can you warn people that deep vein thrombosis

3953
02:33:03,160 --> 02:33:04,400
is serious.

3954
02:33:04,400 --> 02:33:07,360
Get up and walk around about every two hours.

3955
02:33:07,360 --> 02:33:10,360
Yeah, when they say take a break

3956
02:33:10,360 --> 02:33:11,600
during a long gaming session,

3957
02:33:11,600 --> 02:33:12,440
they're not kidding.

3958
02:33:12,440 --> 02:33:13,680
You really should get up and take a break.

3959
02:33:13,680 --> 02:33:15,120
Even when we raid in WoW,

3960
02:33:15,120 --> 02:33:17,440
we take a quote unquote bio break

3961
02:33:17,440 --> 02:33:19,600
every couple hours for a few minutes.

3962
02:33:19,600 --> 02:33:21,380
You know, that's a chance for folks to get up,

3963
02:33:21,380 --> 02:33:23,960
get water, stay hydrated, get a snack,

3964
02:33:23,960 --> 02:33:25,400
go to the restroom and so forth.

3965
02:33:25,400 --> 02:33:26,240
It's just good practice.

3966
02:33:26,240 --> 02:33:28,920
Well yeah, that guy sat down I think for 12 hours.

3967
02:33:28,920 --> 02:33:31,680
Are we talking about the guy in overseas

3968
02:33:31,680 --> 02:33:32,840
that like died or whatever?

3969
02:33:32,840 --> 02:33:33,680
Yeah.

3970
02:33:34,920 --> 02:33:37,040
Yeah, what was that all about?

3971
02:33:37,040 --> 02:33:39,160
12 hour gaming session.

3972
02:33:39,160 --> 02:33:40,120
It'll kill ya.

3973
02:33:44,040 --> 02:33:47,160
Alright, moving on to more tweets at twitter.com slash O-L-R.

3974
02:33:47,160 --> 02:33:50,360
A couple from Tiger Claw back to back here.

3975
02:33:50,360 --> 02:33:55,360
North Korea's Kim Jong Il is running MMO gold farming racket

3976
02:33:55,440 --> 02:33:57,320
is the tweet that's sent here.

3977
02:33:57,320 --> 02:33:59,360
This is a news story from Game Informer

3978
02:33:59,360 --> 02:34:01,200
delivered to us from Tiger Claw.

3979
02:34:01,200 --> 02:34:03,900
The New York Times is reporting that North Korea

3980
02:34:03,900 --> 02:34:06,100
is using a team of hackers to infiltrate

3981
02:34:06,100 --> 02:34:10,200
popular South Korean MMORPGs and farm in-game points.

3982
02:34:10,200 --> 02:34:12,220
Specially trained North Korean hackers

3983
02:34:12,220 --> 02:34:16,380
working in concert with South Korean and Chinese operatives

3984
02:34:16,380 --> 02:34:19,480
have been infiltrating popular MMOs like Lineage

3985
02:34:19,480 --> 02:34:21,000
accumulating in-game points,

3986
02:34:21,000 --> 02:34:23,260
selling them on the internet black market.

3987
02:34:24,100 --> 02:34:25,780
Wow, the Times say that they've earned

3988
02:34:25,780 --> 02:34:27,740
over six million dollars for their efforts,

3989
02:34:27,740 --> 02:34:29,240
over half of which has been delivered

3990
02:34:29,240 --> 02:34:32,120
to North Korean agents in the capital of Pyongyang.

3991
02:34:33,040 --> 02:34:35,960
Yeah, so please don't support this stuff

3992
02:34:35,960 --> 02:34:38,260
because that's just, I mean, look.

3993
02:34:39,720 --> 02:34:41,400
People are gonna do whatever they have to do to make money.

3994
02:34:41,400 --> 02:34:43,160
That's fine, but when you support it,

3995
02:34:43,160 --> 02:34:46,480
like you're supporting devious tactics like hacking,

3996
02:34:46,480 --> 02:34:49,180
like credit card information getting stolen and so forth,

3997
02:34:49,180 --> 02:34:51,520
it's all going to ruin your gameplay experience.

3998
02:34:51,520 --> 02:34:54,040
And that's why now ultimately Diablo 3

3999
02:34:54,040 --> 02:34:57,120
is gonna require an internet connection, right?

4000
02:34:58,880 --> 02:35:00,760
Tiger Claw also links us to this story

4001
02:35:00,760 --> 02:35:03,160
and usually I let people only have two stories,

4002
02:35:03,160 --> 02:35:06,440
but I gotta say, this one is of definite relevant interest

4003
02:35:06,440 --> 02:35:09,000
to at least one person here in studio.

4004
02:35:09,000 --> 02:35:12,360
Tiger Claw tweets us about Ragnarok Online.

4005
02:35:12,360 --> 02:35:13,720
Yay.

4006
02:35:13,720 --> 02:35:16,560
Has launched an iOS companion game

4007
02:35:16,560 --> 02:35:20,560
for its popular MMORPG, now out in its ninth year.

4008
02:35:20,560 --> 02:35:24,580
Ragnarok Violet is a single-player experience

4009
02:35:24,580 --> 02:35:26,720
that utilizes many of the same functions,

4010
02:35:26,720 --> 02:35:30,340
mechanics, and environments as the original.

4011
02:35:30,340 --> 02:35:32,840
So it's kind of like, I guess, a spinoff mobile game

4012
02:35:32,840 --> 02:35:34,460
that lets you have a single-player experience

4013
02:35:34,460 --> 02:35:35,300
of Ragnarok.

4014
02:35:35,300 --> 02:35:36,960
What does it say in America?

4015
02:35:36,960 --> 02:35:40,760
It does not say, oh no, it looks like it is in US.

4016
02:35:40,760 --> 02:35:42,480
You can read the description on the App Store

4017
02:35:42,480 --> 02:35:45,280
and I click on it and it takes me to the US App Store

4018
02:35:45,280 --> 02:35:46,600
for Ragnarok Violet.

4019
02:35:46,600 --> 02:35:47,440
I'm looking up, looking for it.

4020
02:35:47,440 --> 02:35:49,640
I didn't even get that sentence out of my mouth

4021
02:35:49,640 --> 02:35:52,300
and Dark Sakura, I heard the click on the iPhone.

4022
02:35:54,360 --> 02:35:55,200
Shut up.

4023
02:35:55,200 --> 02:35:56,020
It's free.

4024
02:35:56,880 --> 02:35:58,360
But, oh, there's in-game items,

4025
02:35:58,360 --> 02:36:01,240
like you can get pet eggs and all this crap.

4026
02:36:01,240 --> 02:36:02,640
It's like a free thing.

4027
02:36:03,960 --> 02:36:05,560
Way to go, Tiger Claw.

4028
02:36:05,560 --> 02:36:08,280
We just lost Dark Sakura to Ragnarok all over again.

4029
02:36:08,280 --> 02:36:10,280
Thanks, Tiger Claw.

4030
02:36:10,280 --> 02:36:12,120
Yeah, but the one problem is that if it works

4031
02:36:12,120 --> 02:36:16,040
with my IRO account and I'm not playing IRO anymore,

4032
02:36:16,040 --> 02:36:17,640
then I might be kind of SOL.

4033
02:36:17,640 --> 02:36:20,120
Dark Tetsuya in our chat reminds us about a birthday

4034
02:36:20,120 --> 02:36:22,080
that happened saying, yesterday there was a birthday

4035
02:36:22,080 --> 02:36:24,500
that harkens back to our music game roots.

4036
02:36:24,500 --> 02:36:27,800
Taku Sakiyakiabra, I probably mispronounced that name

4037
02:36:27,800 --> 02:36:30,160
really horribly, turned another year older.

4038
02:36:30,160 --> 02:36:33,460
But you guys all know Taku or T-A-Q, not Taco,

4039
02:36:33,460 --> 02:36:36,400
but Taku, turned a year older.

4040
02:36:36,400 --> 02:36:38,160
How old does that make him?

4041
02:36:38,160 --> 02:36:38,980
I don't know.

4042
02:36:38,980 --> 02:36:39,820
A year older.

4043
02:36:39,820 --> 02:36:40,760
A year older.

4044
02:36:40,760 --> 02:36:42,000
But here you go, guys.

4045
02:36:42,000 --> 02:36:44,020
Enjoy some Birthday Holic.

4046
02:36:44,020 --> 02:36:49,020
There you go, Birthday Holic for Taku.

4047
02:36:49,680 --> 02:36:52,080
All right, let's go to Black Lab.

4048
02:36:52,080 --> 02:36:52,920
Remember him?

4049
02:36:52,920 --> 02:36:55,920
He used to come to this show like years and years ago,

4050
02:36:55,920 --> 02:36:58,120
like in the first 100 episodes or so.

4051
02:36:58,120 --> 02:37:00,800
He's listening tonight and sends his tweets

4052
02:37:00,800 --> 02:37:02,080
and has some Twitter questions.

4053
02:37:02,080 --> 02:37:05,280
Number one, will there be a drunk show soon?

4054
02:37:05,280 --> 02:37:06,120
Probably not.

4055
02:37:06,120 --> 02:37:07,300
I gave up drinking.

4056
02:37:08,600 --> 02:37:09,440
Probably not.

4057
02:37:09,440 --> 02:37:10,840
Not that old.

4058
02:37:10,840 --> 02:37:13,680
Question two, does Jamie still have that copy

4059
02:37:13,680 --> 02:37:15,080
of Owen Don that I gave her?

4060
02:37:15,080 --> 02:37:16,080
Happy face.

4061
02:37:16,080 --> 02:37:18,640
Yes, it's actually in my DS case right now.

4062
02:37:18,640 --> 02:37:20,560
Actually, I think it's in my DS right now.

4063
02:37:20,560 --> 02:37:21,920
And you should say if he wants it back,

4064
02:37:21,920 --> 02:37:24,020
he has to come be on the show again.

4065
02:37:24,020 --> 02:37:25,760
He gave it to me.

4066
02:37:25,760 --> 02:37:26,600
Oh, he gave, oh, I thought it was like-

4067
02:37:26,600 --> 02:37:28,600
Actually, I think I paid him for it.

4068
02:37:28,600 --> 02:37:30,000
Oh, I sound like a, oh, I thought,

4069
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:31,560
the way it was phrased, it sounded like a loner

4070
02:37:31,560 --> 02:37:32,840
or something like that.

4071
02:37:32,840 --> 02:37:33,680
Oh well.

4072
02:37:33,680 --> 02:37:36,120
Also, another last minute question from Black Lab.

4073
02:37:36,120 --> 02:37:38,160
How to get a Nintendo fan girl

4074
02:37:38,160 --> 02:37:41,680
to try playing non-Zelda games?

4075
02:37:41,680 --> 02:37:44,880
Well, if she's not playing non-Zelda games,

4076
02:37:44,880 --> 02:37:48,680
then she's not much of a fangirl, is she, of Nintendo.

4077
02:37:48,680 --> 02:37:51,660
Dark Sakura, I don't know, you're the girl.

4078
02:37:51,660 --> 02:37:52,960
How do you convince other girls

4079
02:37:52,960 --> 02:37:54,560
to play games that aren't Zelda?

4080
02:37:55,800 --> 02:37:58,800
Pass over your DS and say, here, give this a go.

4081
02:37:58,800 --> 02:38:01,000
What if they say, no, I'm too busy.

4082
02:38:02,400 --> 02:38:03,520
Busy doing what?

4083
02:38:03,520 --> 02:38:04,440
My hair.

4084
02:38:05,320 --> 02:38:06,200
Oh, well, that's important.

4085
02:38:06,200 --> 02:38:08,240
Baking a pie.

4086
02:38:08,240 --> 02:38:09,280
As long as they share the pie.

4087
02:38:09,280 --> 02:38:11,720
Doing my application for the tester.

4088
02:38:11,720 --> 02:38:12,880
I already did that.

4089
02:38:15,040 --> 02:38:16,680
There's always time for games.

4090
02:38:19,280 --> 02:38:20,640
I'm updating my echo phone.

4091
02:38:20,640 --> 02:38:24,160
Find something where there's like a Barbie mode

4092
02:38:24,160 --> 02:38:26,320
where you can do dress up or customization

4093
02:38:26,320 --> 02:38:27,480
because women like that shit.

4094
02:38:27,480 --> 02:38:30,200
No, you wanna know what's funny is that,

4095
02:38:32,600 --> 02:38:35,080
I seriously think that wrestling games,

4096
02:38:35,080 --> 02:38:38,440
those WWF games or whatever, WBE games,

4097
02:38:38,440 --> 02:38:43,000
are like dress up dolls for dudes.

4098
02:38:43,000 --> 02:38:44,760
Because seriously, you can change your outfit.

4099
02:38:44,760 --> 02:38:48,240
I've seen Dan spend hours making wrestlers.

4100
02:38:48,240 --> 02:38:49,720
It's freaking hilarious.

4101
02:38:51,200 --> 02:38:52,040
All right.

4102
02:38:52,040 --> 02:38:54,040
Oh, and also changing the bikinis out

4103
02:38:54,040 --> 02:38:56,020
on Dead or Alive volleyball.

4104
02:38:57,620 --> 02:38:58,920
All right, that's gonna do it

4105
02:38:58,920 --> 02:39:01,340
for the Twitter tonight and the Skype line.

4106
02:39:01,340 --> 02:39:03,400
Thank you guys so much for your tweets and your calls.

4107
02:39:03,400 --> 02:39:04,980
If you didn't get through tonight,

4108
02:39:04,980 --> 02:39:05,820
send us an email.

4109
02:39:05,820 --> 02:39:07,700
Mailbag at orangelongerator.com

4110
02:39:07,700 --> 02:39:10,920
or send us a tweet for next week at twitter.com slash O-L-R.

4111
02:39:10,920 --> 02:39:12,320
In the meantime, I'm gonna go over to Loki

4112
02:39:12,320 --> 02:39:14,480
and see if there's any last minute stories tonight.

4113
02:39:14,480 --> 02:39:15,320
I don't think there is.

4114
02:39:15,320 --> 02:39:16,160
I think we got it all, but.

4115
02:39:16,160 --> 02:39:18,320
Yeah, it was really slow.

4116
02:39:18,320 --> 02:39:19,740
Yeah, it was kind of a slow news week,

4117
02:39:19,740 --> 02:39:21,360
hence why it's kind of a shorter show tonight.

4118
02:39:21,360 --> 02:39:23,760
But they can't always be action packed weeks,

4119
02:39:23,760 --> 02:39:25,120
especially as we get closer and closer.

4120
02:39:25,120 --> 02:39:26,720
Once we get after Labor Day,

4121
02:39:26,720 --> 02:39:28,160
it's just gonna be go, go, go, go, go

4122
02:39:28,160 --> 02:39:29,040
till the end of the year.

4123
02:39:29,040 --> 02:39:30,920
So we'll see.

4124
02:39:30,920 --> 02:39:33,100
All right, well, that means we're coming to the close

4125
02:39:33,100 --> 02:39:34,740
of another episode of Orange Launch Radio.

4126
02:39:34,740 --> 02:39:37,520
And I want to thank all you guys for listening this week.

4127
02:39:37,520 --> 02:39:39,720
Thank you for supporting our show as always.

4128
02:39:39,720 --> 02:39:41,680
If you liked what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio,

4129
02:39:41,680 --> 02:39:43,560
please tell somebody else about the show.

4130
02:39:43,560 --> 02:39:44,840
Word of mouth is all we have.

4131
02:39:44,840 --> 02:39:46,460
We don't even ask for money.

4132
02:39:46,460 --> 02:39:48,880
We are the humble indie podcast bundle

4133
02:39:48,880 --> 02:39:50,280
of all games programming.

4134
02:39:50,280 --> 02:39:51,440
We don't even ask for your money.

4135
02:39:51,440 --> 02:39:53,160
All we ask is spread the word,

4136
02:39:53,160 --> 02:39:54,840
leave us a nice review on iTunes

4137
02:39:54,840 --> 02:39:57,780
or whatever podcasting site you use to find this show.

4138
02:39:57,780 --> 02:39:58,840
We'd really appreciate it.

4139
02:39:58,840 --> 02:40:00,640
It goes a long way to help promote the show.

4140
02:40:00,640 --> 02:40:03,840
So thank you guys again for continuing to support the show

4141
02:40:03,840 --> 02:40:04,660
week after week.

4142
02:40:04,660 --> 02:40:06,780
Showing up on Sunday nights, those of you that can

4143
02:40:06,780 --> 02:40:07,640
and so on.

4144
02:40:07,640 --> 02:40:09,760
It makes it all worthwhile to be here again.

4145
02:40:09,760 --> 02:40:12,520
And for Dark Sakura to make an audition tape

4146
02:40:12,520 --> 02:40:15,600
that you all can vote on soon for this show

4147
02:40:15,600 --> 02:40:17,520
that I can't believe she's actually going to go on.

4148
02:40:17,520 --> 02:40:19,760
Let me just check all of my Sony stuff behind me.

4149
02:40:19,760 --> 02:40:22,280
Go look at this shit.

4150
02:40:22,280 --> 02:40:23,200
You owe me.

4151
02:40:24,680 --> 02:40:26,320
All right, let's go around

4152
02:40:26,320 --> 02:40:28,720
and get everybody's final thought tonight.

4153
02:40:28,720 --> 02:40:29,800
Loki, we'll start with you.

4154
02:40:29,800 --> 02:40:31,640
The cheating cheater of Tiny Tower,

4155
02:40:31,640 --> 02:40:35,560
the hacker who has five million Tower bucks

4156
02:40:35,560 --> 02:40:36,940
that he did not purchase.

4157
02:40:37,880 --> 02:40:40,740
And it's basically infinite because it's not going down.

4158
02:40:41,640 --> 02:40:43,080
What's your final thought tonight?

4159
02:40:43,080 --> 02:40:45,460
My final thought is I have 13 floors already.

4160
02:40:47,880 --> 02:40:50,360
Dark Sakura, what's your final thought tonight?

4161
02:40:50,360 --> 02:40:51,260
Hire me.

4162
02:40:52,400 --> 02:40:57,080
And my final thought tonight is tacos.

4163
02:40:57,080 --> 02:40:58,360
That's going to do it for another week

4164
02:40:58,360 --> 02:40:59,640
here at Orange Launch Radio.

4165
02:40:59,640 --> 02:41:00,960
Thanks again for tuning in.

4166
02:41:00,960 --> 02:41:03,480
We will be back to do it all again next week.

4167
02:41:03,480 --> 02:41:04,760
So we'll see you then.

4168
02:41:04,760 --> 02:41:06,160
Have a good night, everybody.

4169
02:41:07,840 --> 02:41:11,080
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

4170
02:41:11,080 --> 02:41:14,840
Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.

To join us for a live show,

4172
02:41:16,840 --> 02:41:21,640
visit www.allgames.com Sunday nights

4173
02:41:21,640 --> 02:41:24,040

4174
02:41:24,040 --> 02:41:26,920
The views and opinions expressed on Orange Lounge Radio

4175
02:41:26,920 --> 02:41:30,080
do not necessarily reflect those of the entire staff

4176
02:41:30,080 --> 02:41:33,640
of Orange Lounge Radio or allgames.com,

4177
02:41:33,640 --> 02:41:36,200
but we're probably right anyway.

4178
02:41:36,200 --> 02:42:05,200
See you next week.
