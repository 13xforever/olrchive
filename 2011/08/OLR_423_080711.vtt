00:00.000 --> 00:20.040
Tonight, August 7th, 2011, the Vita gets bumped to 2012, the Humble Indie bundle adds even

00:20.040 --> 00:29.760
more games, and can you soon make a living playing Diablo 3?

00:29.760 --> 00:34.520
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

00:34.520 --> 00:39.160
where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.

00:39.160 --> 00:42.960
My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-hosts.

00:42.960 --> 00:46.640
First off, the one, the only, Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

00:46.640 --> 00:47.640
Hi.

00:47.640 --> 00:48.640
How are you, Jamie?

00:48.640 --> 00:50.280
I'm a culinary fucking goddess.

00:50.280 --> 00:51.920
Congratulations.

00:51.920 --> 00:53.820
What makes you a culinary fucking goddess?

00:53.820 --> 00:56.320
Because I'm sharing one of my favorite recipes with you guys today.

00:56.320 --> 00:57.320
What would that recipe be?

00:57.320 --> 00:58.320
Monkeys' brains?

00:58.320 --> 00:59.960
No.

00:59.960 --> 01:04.560
While, you know, famous in Cantonese cuisine is rarely seen in the United States, no.

01:04.560 --> 01:05.560
Touche.

01:05.560 --> 01:07.440
Or in Washington, D.C., I should say.

01:07.440 --> 01:13.160
No, they are blue potatoes, baked instead of fried, but baked with garlic, majorum,

01:13.160 --> 01:17.320
oregano, Himalayan salt, pepper, and lots of-

01:17.320 --> 01:18.320
Himalayan salt?

01:18.320 --> 01:21.280
I asked for Mongolian salt, god damn it.

01:21.280 --> 01:24.680
Lots of garlic, and plenty of Italian cheeses.

01:24.680 --> 01:26.160
Oh, well, garlic salt always.

01:26.160 --> 01:27.160
So eat some.

01:27.160 --> 01:29.440
Okay, I will, I will, but I've got to set up the show first.

01:29.440 --> 01:30.440
Okay.

01:30.440 --> 01:31.440
All right.

01:31.440 --> 01:35.880
Say hello as well to less of a culinary goddess, but still pretty awesome, tech master, Loki.

01:35.880 --> 01:36.880
How's it going?

01:36.880 --> 01:37.880
I'm good.

01:37.880 --> 01:39.200
How are you, Loki?

01:39.200 --> 01:40.200
Pretty good.

01:40.200 --> 01:41.200
Yeah?

01:41.200 --> 01:42.200
What's new with you?

01:42.200 --> 01:43.200
Not much.

01:43.200 --> 01:45.200
Has there been any culinary works in your life?

01:45.200 --> 01:50.440
I know you used to do, you used to deep fry everything in good times.

01:50.440 --> 01:54.400
Yeah, I haven't really done any deep frying in a while.

01:54.400 --> 01:56.400
Well, that's too bad.

01:56.400 --> 01:57.680
All right.

01:57.680 --> 02:02.680
Well, let's start talking about games with you guys in our chatroom at chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

02:02.680 --> 02:05.600
If you've never joined us for a live show, you should sometime.

02:05.600 --> 02:08.840
Sunday nights, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf

02:08.840 --> 02:13.560
show at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.

02:13.560 --> 02:15.680
And yep, we have our chatters there.

02:15.680 --> 02:19.120
Let's see, Tigerclaw says, Rob, did you just say monkeys?

02:19.120 --> 02:21.160
Then you must have seen the new Planet of the Apes.

02:21.160 --> 02:23.200
Nope, didn't see the new Planet of the Apes.

02:23.200 --> 02:25.760
I heard it was number one in the box office, so it did way better than everyone thought

02:25.760 --> 02:26.760
it would.

02:26.760 --> 02:27.760
And they threw lots of number two.

02:27.760 --> 02:31.280
I used to hate those movies, actually, growing up.

02:31.280 --> 02:35.000
Like, I think my dad or my brother or somebody really liked those movies, and I always thought

02:35.000 --> 02:36.080
they were terrible.

02:36.080 --> 02:38.520
Like the Charlton Heston, I really don't like Charlton Heston.

02:38.520 --> 02:43.920
Like, it has nothing to do with the politics side or the gun, my cold, dead hands on stuff.

02:43.920 --> 02:46.440
Just, I just, God, I don't know.

02:46.440 --> 02:48.960
Like something about him in movies just irritates me.

02:48.960 --> 02:49.960
I don't know.

02:49.960 --> 02:52.720
I'm sure there's a lot of people that would disagree, and that's fine.

02:52.720 --> 02:54.000
Sometimes we disagree on this show.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.720
But let's talk less about movies and talk about games.

02:56.720 --> 02:57.760
We'll start off with Dark Soccer.

02:57.760 --> 02:59.200
How was your gaming week?

02:59.200 --> 03:01.480
Um, freaking Tiny Tower.

03:01.480 --> 03:02.840
I blame you.

03:02.840 --> 03:04.160
I'm up to floor 11 now.

03:04.160 --> 03:06.440
It's actually kind of fun in a...

03:06.440 --> 03:09.760
They talked about Mario twice.

03:09.760 --> 03:13.880
I think Nintendo has a hidden agenda in that game.

03:13.880 --> 03:14.880
How so?

03:14.880 --> 03:18.240
Well, there's been two Mario references.

03:18.240 --> 03:20.440
There's also, I saw Bobby posted on Twitter.

03:20.440 --> 03:24.920
There's a Bad Dudes reference in there somewhere.

03:24.920 --> 03:28.400
Like a bad enough dude to take on, or to save the president or whatever.

03:28.400 --> 03:30.160
Was that line from the original Bad Dudes game?

03:30.160 --> 03:31.160
Yeah.

03:31.160 --> 03:32.400
It's pretty funny though.

03:32.400 --> 03:36.960
And um, I actually didn't play any Groove Coaster.

03:36.960 --> 03:37.960
That's too bad.

03:37.960 --> 03:38.960
It's fine.

03:38.960 --> 03:39.960
I played a lot of WoW.

03:39.960 --> 03:43.800
Mostly because I've been forever alone.

03:43.800 --> 03:44.800
My husband's gone.

03:44.800 --> 03:47.400
He'll be back next week though.

03:47.400 --> 03:49.560
You've been neglecting your consoles.

03:49.560 --> 03:50.560
A little bit.

03:50.560 --> 03:54.000
I actually was gonna go in and play the Saturn and I was like, I gotta do what to hook it

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
up?

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
Nevermind.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
Alright.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.920
There's actually an email that I was reading in the emails that I'll have to get to later

03:59.920 --> 04:02.480
on that kind of asks you about playing the old games in the vault.

04:02.480 --> 04:03.480
Yep.

04:03.480 --> 04:04.480
Curious to hear about that later.

04:04.480 --> 04:05.480
But we'll get to that in part B.

04:05.480 --> 04:07.400
Alright, well Loki, how was your gaming week?

04:07.400 --> 04:09.520
Um, it was okay.

04:09.520 --> 04:12.000
I played lots of Groove Coaster.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.520
That game's pretty fun.

04:13.520 --> 04:20.840
It almost seems like it should be like a Q games game, but here it's not.

04:20.840 --> 04:24.480
More Grand Theft Auto and more Earth Defense Force.

04:24.480 --> 04:29.840
Actually, a lot of Earth Defense Force this week, which is kind of cool.

04:29.840 --> 04:31.800
Leveling up my tactical guy.

04:31.800 --> 04:39.520
We finished going through, well I had already gone through all the, was it like normal mode

04:39.520 --> 04:45.980
or whatever, and my coworker hadn't though, so we played through that again, and now we're

04:45.980 --> 04:48.760
starting hard again.

04:48.760 --> 04:54.600
So I'll level up my tactical guy a little bit more, I think he's level 5 right now.

04:54.600 --> 05:00.000
Do want to start leveling up some other characters, but haven't had time.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
So that's pretty much it.

05:01.000 --> 05:05.600
Oh, and now of course the tiny tower, because I have to join the cult that is the tiny tower.

05:05.600 --> 05:06.600
Are you in Game Center?

05:06.600 --> 05:07.600
No, you don't use that.

05:07.600 --> 05:08.600
Yeah, I use that.

05:08.600 --> 05:09.600
You don't have to have me on there.

05:09.600 --> 05:11.560
Oh no, I do have you on there.

05:11.560 --> 05:13.800
You are the only person that's on my Game Center.

05:13.800 --> 05:18.200
I don't see your tower yet because you didn't start playing until like today, so I got it.

05:18.200 --> 05:19.200
Yes.

05:19.200 --> 05:20.400
Alright, my gaming week.

05:20.400 --> 05:23.600
I picked up the Humble Indie Bundle, which I know is going to come up in the show later,

05:23.600 --> 05:27.120
so I'll talk more about the bundle itself when it comes up in the news later.

05:27.120 --> 05:31.360
But one of the games in the Humble Indie Bundle has been taking up a lot of my time, and that's

05:31.360 --> 05:32.360
because I think it's terrific.

05:32.360 --> 05:36.940
It's a terrific game, and it's one of those games, it's been brought up on the show before,

05:36.940 --> 05:40.440
and I distinctly remember somebody had called in at the end of the year last year to say

05:40.440 --> 05:44.240
that this was their favorite game of the year, and I was like, oh, I'll have to check that

05:44.240 --> 05:47.560
out at some point, you know, and amongst all the other games I tried to fit in in a day,

05:47.560 --> 05:49.760
I just never got around to it until now.

05:49.760 --> 05:55.560
But now that I play this game, it's just like taking up all my time that I'm not playing

05:55.560 --> 06:13.640
like WoW or an MMO or something, and that's VVVVVVVV.

06:13.640 --> 06:17.520
I mean, this game could have been on the Commodore 64, that's obviously kind of the style they're

06:17.520 --> 06:24.660
going for, but the music adds so much to it.

06:24.660 --> 06:26.700
because the music is amazing in the game.

06:26.700 --> 06:27.920
It's all chiptune type stuff.

06:27.920 --> 06:30.480
If you like the Scott Pilgrim soundtrack, Super Meat Boy,

06:30.480 --> 06:32.540
that type of stuff, you'll love the soundtrack to this.

06:32.540 --> 06:35.560
And obviously it takes a lot of influences

06:35.560 --> 06:37.020
from more recent gaming.

06:37.020 --> 06:39.380
I think if you like Super Meat Boy,

06:39.380 --> 06:40.760
this type of game's right up your alley

06:40.760 --> 06:45.120
because it's about dying over and over and over again

06:45.120 --> 06:47.040
on a level until you get it just right.

06:47.040 --> 06:48.640
But then there's that whole exploration

06:48.640 --> 06:52.600
and open world sense of the game

06:52.600 --> 06:55.560
that you can kind of go rescue your friends in any order.

06:55.560 --> 06:57.440
That's kind of where VVVVV gets its name

06:57.440 --> 06:59.520
is it's you and all the friends that get lost on the,

06:59.520 --> 07:00.700
you know, the spaceship blows up

07:00.700 --> 07:02.260
and pieces are all over the planet

07:02.260 --> 07:03.400
and all your friends are lost

07:03.400 --> 07:04.960
and you gotta go around and kind of find them

07:04.960 --> 07:06.320
and rescue them.

07:06.320 --> 07:08.280
And some of the areas are really hard.

07:08.280 --> 07:11.080
And each area kind of has its own little like trick.

07:11.080 --> 07:13.260
Like even though the main point of the game

07:13.260 --> 07:14.880
is push button flip gravity,

07:14.880 --> 07:19.280
which is much more involved than it would sound.

07:19.280 --> 07:21.160
Like some, like one dungeon

07:21.160 --> 07:22.880
or whatever you want to call it that I was in

07:22.880 --> 07:24.160
had trip wires.

07:24.160 --> 07:25.360
And whenever you hit the trip wire,

07:25.360 --> 07:26.740
the gravity automatically flipped.

07:26.740 --> 07:28.560
And so you really had to kind of like

07:28.560 --> 07:30.360
maneuver your character to hit trip wires

07:30.360 --> 07:31.900
sometimes sequentially to get through the room

07:31.900 --> 07:33.240
without landing on spikes.

07:33.240 --> 07:35.760
Another area I was in was all about

07:35.760 --> 07:38.020
warping from one side of the room to the other.

07:38.020 --> 07:40.240
Like the only way to escape a room

07:40.240 --> 07:42.240
would be from one predetermined exit.

07:42.240 --> 07:43.720
Kind of like think of like the infinite maze,

07:43.720 --> 07:45.160
like in a Zelda map.

07:45.160 --> 07:46.280
Remember old school Zelda maps?

07:46.280 --> 07:48.240
You had to go like up, left, down, left

07:48.240 --> 07:49.080
or whatever to get out of the maze.

07:49.080 --> 07:51.440
You had to go up and up and up and up and up.

07:51.440 --> 07:54.000
Kind of like that ish sort of thing.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.040
Like that's where it gets its inspiration clearly.

07:56.040 --> 07:57.240
But yeah.

07:57.240 --> 07:59.240
Like the way you get to the graveyard.

07:59.240 --> 08:00.220
Northwest, what was it?

08:00.220 --> 08:01.200
Northwest, Southwest?

08:01.200 --> 08:02.280
I think it's like up, left, down, left.

08:02.280 --> 08:03.120
Yeah.

08:03.120 --> 08:03.940
Yeah.

08:03.940 --> 08:06.600
So yeah, I mean, clearly the game

08:06.600 --> 08:08.840
takes its influences from more recent games,

08:08.840 --> 08:10.540
but it's not old style.

08:10.540 --> 08:13.120
And so obviously that adds kind of a charm to it

08:13.120 --> 08:17.800
that I guess it all kind of just kind of makes a mood.

08:17.800 --> 08:18.640
I don't know.

08:18.640 --> 08:21.640
I honestly think if the game had just done new graphics,

08:21.640 --> 08:23.240
it would have been horribly overlooked.

08:23.240 --> 08:26.840
Like I think sometimes that whole little retro catch

08:26.840 --> 08:28.360
kind of adds a lot to the game.

08:28.360 --> 08:29.280
There's not just by the way,

08:29.280 --> 08:31.420
the open world Metroidy part of the game.

08:31.420 --> 08:33.520
There's also like time trial levels that you can play.

08:33.520 --> 08:37.600
And you can play made up worlds.

08:37.600 --> 08:40.160
Like there's like a little level packs in it and so forth.

08:40.160 --> 08:41.280
So yeah.

08:41.280 --> 08:44.120
Amazing deal because right now you could get this game

08:44.120 --> 08:45.960
for a dollar if you wanted to.

08:45.960 --> 08:47.820
I think you're kind of cheap if you do,

08:47.820 --> 08:49.360
but I understand some people are broke

08:49.360 --> 08:50.960
and in school and what have you.

08:51.820 --> 08:53.160
It's honestly,

08:53.160 --> 08:55.280
if you miss the Humble Indie Bundle altogether,

08:55.280 --> 08:56.880
it's worth the $10 on Steam.

08:56.880 --> 08:57.720
I think so.

08:57.720 --> 08:58.560
Especially if you like,

08:58.560 --> 09:01.420
like if you like Super Meat Boy and those types of games,

09:01.420 --> 09:04.200
retro fan, this game's right up your alley.

09:04.200 --> 09:05.760
I bought it when it was two bucks.

09:05.760 --> 09:06.600
Oh, nice.

09:06.600 --> 09:07.440
During the Steam sales?

09:07.440 --> 09:08.280
Way back.

09:08.280 --> 09:09.100
Way back.

09:09.100 --> 09:09.940
I've had it for awhile.

09:09.940 --> 09:10.780
Cool.

09:10.780 --> 09:11.600
Yeah.

09:11.600 --> 09:12.440
It was really good.

09:12.440 --> 09:13.280
It's a great game.

09:13.280 --> 09:14.100
So yeah, that was taking up a lot of my time this week.

09:14.100 --> 09:15.360
I played some of the other stuff in the bundle.

09:15.360 --> 09:16.640
I played Cogs for a little bit,

09:16.640 --> 09:18.040
which is kind of like a puzzle game.

09:18.040 --> 09:19.360
That's all about,

09:19.360 --> 09:21.240
like, you know, the sliding puzzles, right?

09:21.240 --> 09:24.660
You know, you have these only keychains and stuff.

09:24.660 --> 09:26.520
Yeah. You move, move a piece over.

09:26.520 --> 09:28.240
Okay. Well imagine that now the pieces

09:28.240 --> 09:29.800
have cog wheels on them

09:29.800 --> 09:32.880
and you have like a spinning gear on one side of the board

09:32.880 --> 09:35.120
and then a golden gear on the other side of the board,

09:35.120 --> 09:38.040
or maybe like you're trying to power a propeller.

09:38.040 --> 09:39.360
So it's just like, you have to move,

09:39.360 --> 09:40.360
instead of making a picture,

09:40.360 --> 09:43.840
it's like the dual puzzle of line up the wheels, right?

09:43.840 --> 09:46.520
So that way it powers the machine.

09:46.520 --> 09:49.560
It's kind of got that whole like steampunk-ish vibe,

09:49.560 --> 09:50.400
but not really, I don't know.

09:50.400 --> 09:54.160
It's very, very puzzle-y interface and so forth.

09:54.160 --> 09:55.960
So I, yeah, that was, that was fun.

09:55.960 --> 09:58.040
So those are kind of the big ones I've checked out.

09:58.040 --> 09:59.400
Otherwise, most of the same stuff,

09:59.400 --> 10:01.200
Warcraft, Final Fantasy 13,

10:01.200 --> 10:03.040
randomly played Wipeout this week.

10:03.040 --> 10:05.520
I don't know, just wanted to play F-Zero

10:05.520 --> 10:06.760
and didn't feel like cooking up the GameCube.

10:06.760 --> 10:07.880
So I'm like, oh, let's play Wipeout.

10:07.880 --> 10:09.400
It's about the next best thing.

10:10.500 --> 10:11.820
Yeah. There you go.

10:11.820 --> 10:13.400
That was my gaming week.

10:13.400 --> 10:17.040
So let's get into some gaming news.

10:17.040 --> 10:18.400
After I mentioned real quick,

10:18.400 --> 10:19.840
you should always be following us on Twitter,

10:19.840 --> 10:22.240
twitter.com slash O-L-R or Facebook,

10:22.240 --> 10:24.280
facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

10:24.280 --> 10:25.800
Those are places to follow us online.

10:25.800 --> 10:26.920
Of course, there's always our website

10:26.920 --> 10:29.600
at orangesloungeradio.com where the forums are as well.

10:29.600 --> 10:31.920
Please always help out the show, spread the word.

10:31.920 --> 10:35.680
Five star reviews on iTunes are much, much, much appreciated

10:35.680 --> 10:37.700
because we don't make anything off the show.

10:37.700 --> 10:39.280
We don't even ask you to pay what you want.

10:39.280 --> 10:40.320
It's just free.

10:40.320 --> 10:41.140
Question for you.

10:41.140 --> 10:41.980
Yes.

10:41.980 --> 10:42.820
What did you think?

10:42.820 --> 10:43.660
Of?

10:43.660 --> 10:44.480
The dish.

10:44.480 --> 10:45.320
Oh, what you made?

10:45.320 --> 10:46.640
Am I a culinary goddess or what?

10:46.640 --> 10:48.180
I haven't, well, I've been talking most times,

10:48.180 --> 10:49.200
so I haven't been able to really eat it,

10:49.200 --> 10:50.600
but it's really good.

10:50.600 --> 10:51.440
I like it.

10:51.440 --> 10:52.840
See everybody, I'm awesome.

10:54.200 --> 10:56.520
I don't wanna inflate your ego too much.

10:56.520 --> 10:58.280
You're gonna have to go on Hell's Kitchen or something

10:58.280 --> 10:59.120
and get your ego kicked out of it.

10:59.120 --> 11:03.440
No, because I would punch what's-his-face.

11:03.440 --> 11:06.800
Be like, you're much nicer to the people on MasterChef.

11:08.980 --> 11:10.600
Gordon Ramsay.

11:10.600 --> 11:11.800
All right.

11:11.800 --> 11:14.120
Let's see, going to the chatroom

11:14.120 --> 11:15.920
at chat.orangelandraday.com.

11:15.920 --> 11:17.480
Spazinator PC in chat says,

11:17.480 --> 11:19.080
if there was a sequel to VVVVVVV,

11:19.080 --> 11:22.000
would it be called VVVVVVVV2?

11:22.000 --> 11:22.840
No.

11:22.840 --> 11:24.160
VVVV70s or WWW?

11:24.160 --> 11:51.920
I think it would probably be a letter repeated.

11:51.920 --> 11:54.560
Ugh, I think I'd rather glue my forehead

11:54.560 --> 11:55.960
to a donkey's ass.

11:55.960 --> 11:57.280
An ass's ass.

11:58.640 --> 12:01.240
It's neater than it sounds.

12:01.240 --> 12:02.480
I don't think this,

12:02.480 --> 12:04.520
it really depends what types of games you're into.

12:04.520 --> 12:06.120
If you like actiony type of games,

12:06.120 --> 12:08.360
you're probably not gonna get so much out of cogs,

12:08.360 --> 12:10.080
but there's some people that just, to kill time,

12:10.080 --> 12:12.080
like to sit there and play a little puzzler.

12:12.080 --> 12:13.720
Like, you know, some of you probably play

12:13.720 --> 12:16.460
Plants vs. Zombies, Bejeweled, those are puzzlers.

12:16.460 --> 12:19.040
This is kind of right up that same alley.

12:19.040 --> 12:20.560
All right, there you go.

12:20.560 --> 12:22.620
Chat.orangelandtrady.com if you wanna join us live

12:22.620 --> 12:23.460
on this Sunday night.

12:23.460 --> 12:24.980
Let's get to some gaming news.

12:24.980 --> 12:26.860
We'll start off with Loki.

12:26.860 --> 12:27.700
Ah, yes.

12:29.060 --> 12:30.960
Apparently, the PlayStation Vita

12:30.960 --> 12:33.140
will not be coming out this year.

12:33.140 --> 12:33.980
Too bad.

12:33.980 --> 12:37.040
At least, not over here in the United States

12:37.040 --> 12:39.720
or North America or in Europe.

12:39.720 --> 12:42.200
Instead, it'll be coming out in early 2012.

12:42.200 --> 12:44.940
Of course, I'm assuming Sony being a Japanese company,

12:44.940 --> 12:48.040
the Japanese will get theirs holiday, 2011.

12:48.040 --> 12:53.040
But yeah, right now, no real reason given,

12:55.320 --> 13:00.320
other than, you know, I don't know that they're delaying it.

13:02.160 --> 13:03.200
I think it's a good idea,

13:03.200 --> 13:06.760
because if it means either more units being produced

13:06.760 --> 13:08.480
so that they don't have shortages,

13:08.480 --> 13:13.480
or to have better games coming out at launch,

13:13.720 --> 13:16.960
I mean, both of those things would definitely help them out.

13:16.960 --> 13:19.120
And of course, they were asked

13:19.120 --> 13:20.700
whether they'd be lowering their price,

13:20.700 --> 13:24.280
because Nintendo did it on the 3DS,

13:24.280 --> 13:27.900
they lowered their price to compete with the Vita.

13:27.900 --> 13:28.740
They basically said,

13:28.740 --> 13:30.880
we packed so much into the device

13:30.880 --> 13:32.680
and made it very affordable,

13:32.680 --> 13:34.000
there's no need to lower the price

13:34.000 --> 13:35.980
just because somebody else happens to be

13:35.980 --> 13:38.080
in the video game business

13:38.080 --> 13:40.640
and decided that they were gonna lower their price.

13:41.880 --> 13:44.760
And honestly, there is a lot of components in the Vita,

13:44.760 --> 13:48.120
but if that shit isn't gonna sell at launch,

13:48.120 --> 13:49.460
they will lower the price.

13:50.640 --> 13:52.500
That's just the way things are.

13:54.560 --> 13:58.120
Something else though, got delayed to early 2012 as well.

13:58.120 --> 13:59.400
That'd be Twisted Metal,

13:59.400 --> 14:02.200
which was supposed to be coming out in October,

14:02.200 --> 14:05.800
and now it's early 2012.

14:08.400 --> 14:11.200
They basically said, you know,

14:11.200 --> 14:14.880
late game is only late until it ships.

14:14.880 --> 14:17.680
A bad game is bad until the end of time.

14:18.960 --> 14:19.800
Great quote.

14:22.100 --> 14:24.400
If we shipped Twisted Metal tomorrow,

14:24.400 --> 14:26.680
going off the response from folks who have played it,

14:26.680 --> 14:29.660
I assure you, it would never be a bad game.

14:32.880 --> 14:36.320
But yes, they're spending the extra time polishing the game.

14:36.320 --> 14:41.320
I can wait, it'll be awesome.

14:42.040 --> 14:43.360
Yeah, that game has been in development

14:43.360 --> 14:45.180
for quite some time now, hasn't it?

14:45.180 --> 14:46.020
Yep.

14:47.080 --> 14:49.420
So let's go back to the Vita being delayed.

14:49.420 --> 14:51.280
What does it boil down to, the cost for delay?

14:51.280 --> 14:55.200
It's parts, it's strategical, what's going on?

14:55.200 --> 14:57.720
Because you kinda knew about this

14:57.720 --> 14:59.820
before the rest of the internet did, didn't you?

14:59.820 --> 15:00.880
Yes.

15:00.880 --> 15:01.700
So what's up?

15:02.680 --> 15:04.680
Nothing really, they didn't say.

15:04.680 --> 15:07.520
They said it's 2012.

15:09.400 --> 15:12.280
Part of me wondered if maybe they saw

15:12.280 --> 15:14.540
what the 3DS was doing wrong.

15:14.540 --> 15:16.120
And that was that the 3DS launched

15:16.120 --> 15:19.440
without really having any good games at launch.

15:19.440 --> 15:22.040
Debatable, I understand Street Fighter IV has its fans,

15:22.040 --> 15:23.640
but let's face it, that was a port of a game

15:23.640 --> 15:25.320
that had already been out for a couple years, right?

15:25.320 --> 15:29.160
And if that's your strongest release title, something's up.

15:29.160 --> 15:32.400
So maybe they were looking at that going,

15:32.400 --> 15:34.880
well, what do we have coming out at launch on the Vita?

15:34.880 --> 15:36.480
You know, if these developers aren't really ready

15:36.480 --> 15:38.720
to put out all-star games, maybe now's not the time

15:38.720 --> 15:42.800
to put out the Vita, because that was where my mind went,

15:42.800 --> 15:45.440
is I said, well, maybe the Uncharted people

15:45.440 --> 15:47.000
weren't ready to put out the game.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.400
And if that's your biggest game

15:48.400 --> 15:49.840
and that's gonna get delayed,

15:49.840 --> 15:51.740
let's just delay the whole damn thing.

15:53.400 --> 15:54.240
Could be.

15:54.240 --> 15:56.080
Let's call the whole thing off.

15:56.080 --> 15:58.280
Apparently, so.

15:58.280 --> 16:03.280
All right, well, going to chat.orangelaunchradio.com,

16:03.640 --> 16:05.320
Black Lab is in chat tonight saying,

16:05.320 --> 16:07.200
I can tell Rob started talking mid-chew.

16:07.200 --> 16:08.640
Hey, I gotta eat sometime.

16:09.520 --> 16:11.600
When I got something to say, I'm gonna say it.

16:14.400 --> 16:15.880
Let's see, Brakeman in chat says,

16:15.880 --> 16:18.920
I got a PSP at full price, if only I'd waited.

16:18.920 --> 16:21.560
Well, here's a newsflash.

16:21.560 --> 16:24.000
You could wait to get a Vita too,

16:24.000 --> 16:25.380
but it's probably gonna take a long time

16:25.380 --> 16:26.760
for the price to drop on that,

16:26.760 --> 16:29.640
especially if it comes out in the first part of next year.

16:30.640 --> 16:34.520
There could be a small price drop at the end of next year

16:34.520 --> 16:38.920
going into holiday 2012, but that's not for sure.

16:38.920 --> 16:40.200
I'd be interested in the Vita

16:40.200 --> 16:43.760
if they had Saints Row on it, or Grand Theft Auto.

16:43.760 --> 16:44.680
Might just be a matter of time.

16:44.680 --> 16:46.980
Either one of those is very interchangeable,

16:46.980 --> 16:48.640
or Earth Defense Force.

16:49.820 --> 16:53.020
Any of those three, I would definitely be down for a Vita,

16:53.020 --> 16:56.020
but as of right now, I've seen how much

16:56.020 --> 17:00.800
I play my 3DS, which is not at all.

17:01.920 --> 17:03.520
So I just don't need another system

17:03.520 --> 17:06.960
cluttering up my bank account.

17:06.960 --> 17:08.920
All right, well let's talk about the other handheld,

17:08.920 --> 17:12.200
the 3DS, oh, before we get to 3DS actually,

17:12.200 --> 17:13.240
let me ask one more question.

17:13.240 --> 17:15.400
Does this change your opinion at all about the Vita?

17:15.400 --> 17:17.020
And I asked this to chat too.

17:17.020 --> 17:19.160
Does it change your opinion thus far at the Vita?

17:19.160 --> 17:22.160
Does it change the fact whether you want one or not?

17:22.160 --> 17:23.600
For me, I'll start.

17:23.600 --> 17:25.340
No, it doesn't really change my opinion of the Vita.

17:25.340 --> 17:28.200
In fact, I actually kinda say, you know what?

17:28.200 --> 17:29.760
If you're not ready, then that's cool.

17:29.760 --> 17:32.640
Take your time till you've got a really solid launch lineup.

17:32.640 --> 17:35.180
And B, the fact that the holidays

17:35.180 --> 17:37.720
are gonna be killer anyway, I'm kinda glad

17:37.720 --> 17:40.480
to not have to spend 250 bucks right now on a Vita as well,

17:40.480 --> 17:41.720
because you know I'll have to have it.

17:41.720 --> 17:45.580
So actually, I'm not so bothered by this.

17:45.580 --> 17:46.480
What about you guys?

17:46.480 --> 17:47.980
Loki?

17:47.980 --> 17:52.360
I was kind of just warm about the Vita to begin with,

17:52.360 --> 17:55.760
and nothing really stood out so far with the Vita

17:55.760 --> 17:58.600
that says, I gotta have that system.

17:58.600 --> 18:00.640
So until I see something like that,

18:00.640 --> 18:02.840
then I don't really have to have that system.

18:05.540 --> 18:07.240
It depends on finances.

18:07.240 --> 18:10.360
I mean, the Vita looks nice, hooray.

18:10.360 --> 18:12.600
But I hardly touch my PSP,

18:12.600 --> 18:15.400
so why would I wanna touch the new one?

18:15.400 --> 18:17.160
I really didn't play the PSP that much

18:17.160 --> 18:20.600
except for Popolo Cross and Loco Roco.

18:20.600 --> 18:22.760
There's gonna have to be those must-have games.

18:22.760 --> 18:25.160
Yeah, it's really gonna be more of a matter of games.

18:25.160 --> 18:27.040
I mean, even Dissidia wasn't really enough

18:27.040 --> 18:30.080
to make me really wanna play my PSP.

18:30.080 --> 18:32.780
But see, I got on board with PSP early

18:32.780 --> 18:35.080
because the very first time I played Luminous,

18:35.080 --> 18:37.160
I was like, oh my god, this is the best music puzzle game.

18:37.160 --> 18:39.280
We had a PSP the day they came out.

18:39.280 --> 18:40.240
Yeah, yeah.

18:40.240 --> 18:42.360
And I love Luminous.

18:42.360 --> 18:45.840
I remember playing it really drunk on my birthday,

18:45.840 --> 18:47.960
playing Wendell's PSP.

18:47.960 --> 18:50.880
Shining, shining, room is spinning.

18:50.880 --> 18:52.000
Oh, I didn't even care.

18:52.000 --> 18:55.800
There was a bunch of food, and I think I stopped for fire.

18:55.800 --> 18:58.660
But I got to level 24 after, what,

18:58.660 --> 19:00.540
that 25-ounce beer I drank.

19:02.880 --> 19:05.320
But I mean, I've played stuff that I've liked,

19:05.320 --> 19:07.480
but it's never been really enough to keep me.

19:07.480 --> 19:10.400
I mean, I've taken it on trips and watched movies on it.

19:10.400 --> 19:14.240
Now I have a netbook, so I watch movies on that instead.

19:14.240 --> 19:15.920
Let's go to the chatters and see what they have to say.

19:15.920 --> 19:17.260
Defective Candy in our chat room says,

19:17.260 --> 19:18.640
kudos to them for taking the time

19:18.640 --> 19:21.060
and trying to launch something solid instead of rushing it

19:21.060 --> 19:22.200
like Nintendo.

19:22.200 --> 19:24.240
SonicM88 says, Vita doesn't interest me.

19:24.240 --> 19:27.120
I've never liked Sony's games.

19:27.120 --> 19:29.720
Kitsune says, it may not carry all your favorite games yet,

19:29.720 --> 19:31.560
but it definitely has a lot more than 3DS.

19:31.560 --> 19:33.200
I'm psyched about the Vita.

19:33.200 --> 19:35.760
Dungeonbuster says, doesn't really change my opinion either.

19:35.760 --> 19:37.440
I have the same opinion that Loki does.

19:37.440 --> 19:39.560
I just don't play handhelds all that much.

19:39.560 --> 19:42.000
Mieglatov says, having played it at E3 this year,

19:42.000 --> 19:43.400
it doesn't change my opinion.

19:43.400 --> 19:45.400
Just makes me sad I have to wait longer.

19:45.400 --> 19:49.120
Need sound shapes since it's like the Vita's luminous to me.

19:49.120 --> 19:50.840
Spazinator says, I'd be interested in the Vita

19:50.840 --> 19:52.420
if it'll print money, make me a sandwich,

19:52.420 --> 19:54.920
and order me several slutty strippers every night.

19:54.920 --> 19:56.480
You might be a little bit disappointed.

19:56.480 --> 19:59.520
I don't think these slutty strippers will be in right away.

19:59.520 --> 20:03.000
That could be in the 2.0 firmware though, so stay tuned.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.880
Breakman says, it's a smart move for Sony

20:04.880 --> 20:06.400
to move the Vita to next year.

20:06.400 --> 20:07.700
They don't want to compare its sales

20:07.700 --> 20:09.080
to the sales of the 3DS,

20:09.080 --> 20:11.680
which I think will be one of the biggest Christmas gifts.

20:11.680 --> 20:15.960
Interesting theory, maybe they did it to not compete

20:15.960 --> 20:17.920
with the 3DS.

20:17.920 --> 20:20.320
Maybe they want to hand this Christmas to Nintendo.

20:20.320 --> 20:23.040
Maybe they're a little afraid of the competition.

20:23.040 --> 20:27.220
Is that, does that sound too fanboy motivated or what?

20:31.480 --> 20:35.100
I think it really just is a matter of putting out

20:35.100 --> 20:36.780
a polished product because,

20:37.640 --> 20:39.940
especially with the mistakes that Nintendo's made

20:39.940 --> 20:42.320
with bringing the system out

20:42.320 --> 20:44.880
and not having the right games for it,

20:44.880 --> 20:46.540
that's really hurt their sales.

20:47.660 --> 20:50.220
So I think that they're really just trying

20:50.220 --> 20:51.060
to avoid that trap.

20:51.060 --> 20:54.080
They've seen how it's bit Nintendo in the ass.

20:54.080 --> 20:56.160
All right, well, let's move over and talk Nintendo then.

20:56.160 --> 20:58.800
I was gonna move on and talk about the 3DS.

20:58.800 --> 21:01.200
With the 3DS, there's some more comments

21:01.200 --> 21:03.800
from Nintendo CEO, Satoru Iwata.

21:03.800 --> 21:05.540
Of course, you all know who Iwata is.

21:05.540 --> 21:06.880
He's the man at Nintendo.

21:06.880 --> 21:10.840
He's talking about the 3DS and talking about

21:10.840 --> 21:13.600
kind of the GameCube and how the two relates.

21:13.600 --> 21:16.840
He said in an interview that the GameCube suffered

21:16.840 --> 21:18.920
because Nintendo did not take opportunities

21:18.920 --> 21:20.680
when they were available.

21:20.680 --> 21:22.700
The general feeling within the company's management

21:22.700 --> 21:25.060
is that the console had a chance to succeed,

21:25.060 --> 21:28.640
but that the chance was not taken advantage of.

21:28.640 --> 21:30.940
Iwata has said that the company learned its lesson

21:30.940 --> 21:34.500
and that's why they did a price cut so soon after launch.

21:34.500 --> 21:36.780
Interesting that they kind of brought up

21:36.780 --> 21:38.700
the comparisons to the GameCube there.

21:40.540 --> 21:43.500
Also, wanted to mention this with the 3DS price drop.

21:43.500 --> 21:45.620
There's some rumors going around that Walmart

21:45.620 --> 21:48.380
is going to drop the price early.

21:48.380 --> 21:51.780
So if you wanna go to Walmart on August 9th,

21:51.780 --> 21:54.940
that's the rumor anyway, they are supposedly dropping

21:54.940 --> 21:58.720
the suggested retail price down a little early to the 170.

21:58.720 --> 22:01.460
What this means is that you might be able

22:01.460 --> 22:03.220
to get your cake and eat it too,

22:03.220 --> 22:05.780
meaning if you can buy one of these things

22:05.780 --> 22:08.500
in that window between the early price drop

22:08.500 --> 22:09.780
and the price drop for everybody else,

22:09.780 --> 22:12.000
quickly get it on the Nintendo eShop,

22:12.000 --> 22:14.100
then you will be an early adopter.

22:14.100 --> 22:16.100
So not only did you get the cheap 3DS,

22:16.100 --> 22:19.380
but you got the $80 worth of games too.

22:19.380 --> 22:22.060
So that's one way of working the system.

22:22.940 --> 22:26.020
So I guess call your local Walmart or check.

22:26.020 --> 22:28.380
Who knows, Nintendo may put the smack down on that though.

22:28.380 --> 22:30.180
I don't know if they can.

22:30.180 --> 22:32.180
Loki, I don't know if you know from the retail angle,

22:32.180 --> 22:33.940
but could Nintendo stop this?

22:33.940 --> 22:36.420
Like if Walmart wants to cut the price three days early,

22:36.420 --> 22:38.020
can Nintendo stop that or no?

22:38.020 --> 22:42.340
Well, here's a couple factors that they have in that.

22:42.340 --> 22:45.480
One, whether there is map pricing on it or not,

22:46.420 --> 22:49.820
which is the minimum advertised price.

22:49.820 --> 22:52.280
So if they have map pricing in place on it,

22:53.980 --> 22:56.420
it may prevent them from advertising it lower

22:56.420 --> 22:58.740
than a certain amount.

22:58.740 --> 23:01.100
Also, if they're being price protected on it,

23:01.100 --> 23:05.140
any of those, fucking,

23:05.140 --> 23:10.140
any of those units that they sold

23:10.180 --> 23:12.360
prior to it dropping in price,

23:12.360 --> 23:14.500
they don't get any of the money

23:14.500 --> 23:16.420
from when it dropped in price.

23:16.420 --> 23:18.520
So they would be eating the cost on that.

23:20.740 --> 23:23.740
Now, I wouldn't see Walmart as a company doing this,

23:23.740 --> 23:28.740
but I know that, and none of the people I know,

23:28.740 --> 23:31.340
or work with in the industry do this,

23:31.340 --> 23:33.340
but I know there's people out there to do that,

23:33.340 --> 23:35.280
you can manipulate your price protection

23:35.280 --> 23:38.420
by fudging the numbers, if you will,

23:38.420 --> 23:40.420
and then saying, oh, I didn't really sell

23:40.420 --> 23:41.540
as many units as I did,

23:41.540 --> 23:43.460
and then you get the price protection,

23:43.460 --> 23:45.320
and then you sold those units.

23:47.140 --> 23:47.980
That's how you-

23:47.980 --> 23:48.940
There's kind of ways to work this system,

23:48.940 --> 23:50.780
but Walmart's probably too big to do that.

23:50.780 --> 23:53.180
I wouldn't think they would be able to do that.

23:53.180 --> 23:56.240
So, I don't know.

23:56.240 --> 23:57.460
I don't think that they would be getting

23:57.460 --> 23:59.500
any sort of special exception either,

23:59.500 --> 24:00.940
but you never know.

24:00.940 --> 24:05.080
Well, I mean, I think there's a very small group

24:05.080 --> 24:06.580
that this would even really apply to,

24:06.580 --> 24:09.740
because you're talking about people who won a 3DS,

24:09.740 --> 24:11.460
who didn't already buy one,

24:11.460 --> 24:14.140
who are really just waiting to seize an opportunity,

24:14.140 --> 24:16.500
like it's like couponing or something.

24:16.500 --> 24:20.060
You've got the extreme couponer crowd of video gamers.

24:20.060 --> 24:23.260
I can't buy meat until Wednesday,

24:23.260 --> 24:24.580
because then it's on sale.

24:24.580 --> 24:26.800
Exactly, that's the crowd

24:26.800 --> 24:27.940
that this type of thing calls to,

24:27.940 --> 24:29.800
because that means you have to have $170

24:29.800 --> 24:31.120
burning a hole in your pocket right now,

24:31.120 --> 24:33.060
saying, I'm dropping it on a 3DS,

24:33.060 --> 24:34.400
because I need to be an early adopter,

24:34.400 --> 24:36.060
and I know I want a 3DS.

24:36.060 --> 24:38.380
So, I don't know if that is really a whole lot of people,

24:38.380 --> 24:42.120
but if it's you, start calling places on,

24:42.120 --> 24:43.660
or even get out in the car,

24:43.660 --> 24:47.180
and go to some different places on the 9th, what, Tuesday?

24:47.180 --> 24:49.300
And I totally lost track of time.

24:49.300 --> 24:50.380
Yes, that's Tuesday.

24:50.380 --> 24:53.260
And go check out who might have dropped the price early,

24:53.260 --> 24:54.100
because you never know.

24:54.100 --> 24:55.980
And you have until, what, Thursday night

24:55.980 --> 24:57.780
to connect that thing online

24:57.780 --> 25:00.140
to be considered an early adopter.

25:00.140 --> 25:01.820
Although, what's interesting is that

25:01.820 --> 25:03.460
your system never really tells you

25:03.460 --> 25:05.060
if you're an early adopter or not.

25:05.060 --> 25:06.540
You just kind of have to hope that,

25:06.540 --> 25:07.940
well, I connected to the eShop,

25:07.940 --> 25:10.100
and, well, let's just hope I get lucky.

25:10.100 --> 25:12.680
I downloaded a couple things from the eShop,

25:12.680 --> 25:15.500
so I'm hoping that I'm considered an early adopter.

25:15.500 --> 25:16.700
If not...

25:16.700 --> 25:20.380
Rage, podcast rage.

25:20.380 --> 25:22.220
It's pitchforks and torches.

25:22.220 --> 25:24.020
Exactly, that's kind of where I'm at.

25:24.020 --> 25:27.860
It's like, hey, wait, I have Zelda Color Game Boy

25:27.860 --> 25:30.300
that I got for free, so clearly I had it during E3.

25:30.300 --> 25:33.500
I bought this, like, was it almost day one or...

25:33.500 --> 25:34.340
Was it day one?

25:34.340 --> 25:36.100
I don't even remember when I bought that.

25:36.100 --> 25:38.420
You bought, well, you had the Japanese 3DSs

25:38.420 --> 25:39.620
like hecka early.

25:39.620 --> 25:40.460
True.

25:41.480 --> 25:44.540
But still, though, I had it almost like day one,

25:44.540 --> 25:48.340
so I'm about to begin my fucking games.

25:48.340 --> 25:49.360
I want my games.

25:50.260 --> 25:52.780
I'm gonna come to your house.

25:52.780 --> 25:55.100
All right, let's move on, Dark Sakura.

25:55.100 --> 25:55.940
Twinbee.

25:57.420 --> 26:02.140
So, it's going to be the next game after Urban Champion

26:02.140 --> 26:06.600
to get the 3D Classic deal done to it for the 3DS.

26:08.300 --> 26:09.700
Anyone remember Twinbee?

26:09.700 --> 26:11.420
I love Twinbee.

26:11.420 --> 26:12.740
Wasn't it, didn't it have a different name,

26:12.740 --> 26:13.780
like Stinger or something?

26:13.780 --> 26:16.140
Yes, it was Stinger over here on the NES.

26:17.120 --> 26:20.080
I did do a review, by the way, of Daytona Twinbee, so.

26:20.080 --> 26:23.800
Twinbee is basically a top-down shooter

26:23.800 --> 26:27.020
with cutesy little Twinbee and Winbee,

26:27.020 --> 26:29.520
and you shoot bells for your power-ups

26:29.520 --> 26:31.800
and all kinds of neat stuff.

26:31.800 --> 26:34.840
So, it's going to be out in Japan on August 10th,

26:34.840 --> 26:38.640
and hopefully we'll have it soon after.

26:38.640 --> 26:40.240
I mean, we don't have Urban Champion yet,

26:40.240 --> 26:41.440
but maybe we'll get it.

26:42.440 --> 26:43.340
But Twinbee!

26:44.360 --> 26:46.200
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.

26:46.200 --> 26:47.220
Why this game?

26:47.220 --> 26:49.120
It seems interesting that out of, like,

26:49.120 --> 26:52.560
all the 3D remakes they could do, we're in Twinbee.

26:52.560 --> 26:53.400
I honestly...

26:53.400 --> 26:54.400
You've got to admit, it's not really

26:54.400 --> 26:56.180
the first title you think of.

26:56.180 --> 26:57.640
I think Twinbee, though,

26:57.640 --> 26:59.680
if you look how the levels are laid out,

26:59.680 --> 27:02.960
I think Twinbee does make sense on a graphic,

27:02.960 --> 27:03.880
from a graphic sense,

27:03.880 --> 27:05.600
because you've got your clouds

27:05.600 --> 27:07.520
with all the bells hidden in them,

27:07.520 --> 27:10.200
you've got your bottom layer with, you know,

27:10.200 --> 27:12.000
so you can actually move your...

27:14.640 --> 27:16.160
The same way that it's Xevious, basically.

27:16.160 --> 27:18.080
Yeah, basically the same thing.

27:18.080 --> 27:20.120
But I think it would work for the game.

27:20.120 --> 27:21.360
I think it would be cute.

27:23.080 --> 27:25.360
All right, interesting.

27:25.360 --> 27:26.240
Going back a little bit,

27:26.240 --> 27:27.280
since we're a little bit delayed

27:27.280 --> 27:28.360
between when we say something

27:28.360 --> 27:30.000
and when the live listeners hear it,

27:30.000 --> 27:31.520
because the encoding and everything,

27:31.520 --> 27:32.560
Kaijuto in chat says,

27:32.560 --> 27:34.600
no, you'll know you're an early adopter

27:34.600 --> 27:36.920
because your eShop list will have a section for it

27:36.920 --> 27:39.040
like the PlayStation Network store did.

27:39.040 --> 27:39.860
Really?

27:39.860 --> 27:42.280
But how do we know the non-early adopters don't see that?

27:42.280 --> 27:44.360
Because we haven't gotten that far yet.

27:44.360 --> 27:46.160
Could just be a place that's in the store

27:46.160 --> 27:47.840
as like a heads up or something.

27:47.840 --> 27:48.720
Who knows?

27:48.720 --> 27:49.540
Zether in chat says,

27:49.540 --> 27:51.880
I hope Twinbee isn't Japan only for the 3DS.

27:51.880 --> 27:53.160
It's a good game.

27:53.160 --> 27:55.340
I would imagine if there's money to be made,

27:55.340 --> 27:57.140
why not come out here?

27:57.140 --> 27:59.960
But of course, I don't know, the whole region...

27:59.960 --> 28:01.960
This is Nintendo we're talking about.

28:03.080 --> 28:06.120
And the same could be said of the last story, Xenoblade.

28:06.120 --> 28:06.960
I don't know.

28:08.000 --> 28:08.900
Zether in chat says,

28:08.900 --> 28:09.740
the thing is,

28:09.740 --> 28:12.680
Stinger was actually the second Twinbee NES game.

28:12.680 --> 28:17.320
So who knows what they might do with this 3D remake?

28:17.320 --> 28:18.940
I probably won't buy it.

28:18.940 --> 28:19.780
No, I mean...

28:19.780 --> 28:21.400
There's just too much.

28:21.400 --> 28:23.320
Honestly, if I was gonna go buy Twinbee,

28:23.320 --> 28:26.240
I'd hook up my PC Engine and play my HuCard.

28:26.240 --> 28:28.080
And play a good version of Twinbee.

28:28.080 --> 28:29.680
Not the old NES premium.

28:29.680 --> 28:32.220
I'm not saying the NES version is crap,

28:32.220 --> 28:33.800
but I could play a good version.

28:33.800 --> 28:36.180
I've got multiples, so...

28:36.180 --> 28:37.020
Honestly, what I would do

28:37.020 --> 28:38.880
is probably just play Parodius instead.

28:39.920 --> 28:41.920
All right, let's move on with more news.

28:43.020 --> 28:45.960
So the Humble Indie Bundle 3

28:45.960 --> 28:47.840
has taken in a good,

28:47.840 --> 28:51.540
was it $100 million in the first week.

28:51.540 --> 28:56.540
And they've had over 215,000 downloads already.

28:57.000 --> 29:02.000
Of course, they've just expanded the bundle with Steel Storm.

29:02.320 --> 29:06.080
And then of course the average price is just a little...

29:06.080 --> 29:08.060
Well, at the time it was a little under five bucks.

29:08.060 --> 29:10.120
Now it's just a little over five bucks.

29:10.120 --> 29:15.120
And I guess Linux purchasers are paying a little bit more.

29:15.120 --> 29:18.180
I had 11.62 as the average there.

29:19.920 --> 29:23.200
Of course, they wouldn't just leave it there.

29:23.200 --> 29:26.280
No, they're going to also

29:26.280 --> 29:29.400
add Atom Zombie Smasher,

29:29.400 --> 29:30.800
which is another free game

29:30.800 --> 29:32.880
that they're gonna throw in there.

29:32.880 --> 29:37.780
Also, if you buy the Humble Indie Bundle 3

29:37.780 --> 29:39.120
over the average cost,

29:39.120 --> 29:41.640
which is funny because it's been slowly creeping up.

29:41.640 --> 29:45.820
I believe the last we checked was $5.69,

29:45.820 --> 29:50.120
you can actually get the Humble Indie Bundle 2 as well.

29:50.120 --> 29:53.300
So that's another six games thrown in there.

29:53.300 --> 29:54.880
CRAN Physics Deluxe.

29:54.880 --> 29:58.400
And yet it moves, VVVVV.

29:58.400 --> 30:03.400
And then the set two was Braid Cortex Command Machinium.

30:07.640 --> 30:08.960
I can't pronounce that shit.

30:08.960 --> 30:10.540
Why can't I pronounce that shit?

30:10.540 --> 30:12.980
Machinarium, I guess.

30:12.980 --> 30:13.820
Machinarium.

30:13.820 --> 30:14.640
Machinarium.

30:14.640 --> 30:15.480
Thank you.

30:15.480 --> 30:18.100
My mouth just didn't want to form the word.

30:18.100 --> 30:19.700
It's like, bleh.

30:19.700 --> 30:22.420
Okay, our mouth was mush for machinarium.

30:22.420 --> 30:23.260
Yes.

30:23.260 --> 30:26.260
Osmose and Revenge of the Titans.

30:27.300 --> 30:29.220
You know it's a weird week at OLR

30:29.220 --> 30:31.860
when I'm the one correcting people on pronunciation.

30:31.860 --> 30:32.980
Like, what is up?

30:33.860 --> 30:36.380
There's something, something is in these fries

30:36.380 --> 30:37.500
the Dark Sakura made us.

30:37.500 --> 30:39.620
Yeah, awesome.

30:39.620 --> 30:40.900
Mouth numbing awesome.

30:40.900 --> 30:43.560
I feel like suddenly it's that level in Yoshi's Island

30:43.560 --> 30:45.460
where you touch fuzzy and you get dizzy

30:45.460 --> 30:46.980
and all of a sudden it's like,

30:46.980 --> 30:49.260
Loki's trying to read Machinarium and he's like,

30:49.260 --> 30:50.180
Machinarium.

30:52.100 --> 30:52.940
There's so much by the way.

30:52.940 --> 30:54.160
What's that level?

30:54.160 --> 30:55.000
Really?

30:55.000 --> 30:55.960
Yes.

30:55.960 --> 30:56.940
I'll get more dizzy.

30:56.940 --> 30:58.500
Sounds fun.

30:58.500 --> 31:01.900
She's totally, the garlic salt had crack in it or something.

31:01.900 --> 31:03.480
I didn't use garlic salt.

31:03.480 --> 31:05.260
I used garlic.

31:05.260 --> 31:06.100
Oh, what was this?

31:06.100 --> 31:08.140
Oh, it was like Himalayan salt.

31:08.140 --> 31:09.500
Whatever.

31:09.500 --> 31:11.100
Made with real Himalayans.

31:12.000 --> 31:12.840
Anyhow.

31:12.840 --> 31:13.660
Okay, back to the-

31:13.660 --> 31:15.720
Made from the tears of Himalayans.

31:15.720 --> 31:17.180
Back to the Humble Indie Bundle,

31:17.180 --> 31:20.820
which may or may not be available in Himalaya.

31:20.820 --> 31:23.020
How long are they selling this for anyways?

31:24.700 --> 31:27.460
I think it's only for about another week.

31:27.460 --> 31:29.500
I don't, it's a limited time.

31:29.500 --> 31:32.060
I know that cause I totally missed it last year

31:32.060 --> 31:33.740
cause I don't know, I was drunk or something.

31:33.740 --> 31:36.140
I just totally missed it and I meant to get it

31:36.140 --> 31:37.220
and I never did.

31:37.220 --> 31:39.660
But this year, you betcha I got it,

31:39.660 --> 31:41.220
especially because I'd heard such great things

31:41.220 --> 31:43.060
about VVVVV and I wanted to try it for myself

31:43.060 --> 31:44.060
and I'm really glad I did.

31:44.060 --> 31:45.160
And I'm telling you guys,

31:45.160 --> 31:47.340
for as many games as you get with this,

31:47.340 --> 31:51.820
if you put in six bucks, you've got to get it.

31:51.820 --> 31:56.140
So even if you're like starving student, whatever,

31:56.140 --> 31:58.140
at least pay a dollar.

31:58.140 --> 32:00.740
Go without a soda today and pay a dollar

32:00.740 --> 32:04.320
for just the Humble Indie Bundle three games.

32:05.180 --> 32:06.860
It's so worth it.

32:06.860 --> 32:09.260
And the money goes to a good cause.

32:09.260 --> 32:11.580
It goes to wherever you want it to go to.

32:11.580 --> 32:13.900
You can split it between the different companies

32:13.900 --> 32:14.740
and so forth.

32:14.740 --> 32:16.380
I'm telling you, don't kick yourself later

32:16.380 --> 32:17.740
when you miss out on this.

32:17.740 --> 32:19.080
And don't be a cheapskate either.

32:19.080 --> 32:20.480
If you can afford more than a dollar,

32:20.480 --> 32:22.900
then give them 10 or whatever.

32:22.900 --> 32:24.060
Give them as much as you would pay

32:24.060 --> 32:26.980
for an Xbox Live Arcade game or what have you at least.

32:26.980 --> 32:29.220
Cause I think the games are really worth it.

32:29.220 --> 32:32.360
And I'd like to see a Humble Indie Bundle part four.

32:33.300 --> 32:35.340
So what's that only day and a half.

32:35.340 --> 32:37.460
It looks like, better hurry.

32:37.460 --> 32:38.680
Day and a half.

32:38.680 --> 32:40.820
You can have all the money go to charity if you want.

32:40.820 --> 32:42.520
That's the cool thing about it.

32:42.520 --> 32:45.100
So you better hurry up on that,

32:45.100 --> 32:46.800
especially those of you listening to the podcast.

32:46.800 --> 32:49.500
If it's after Monday night, you might already be screwed,

32:49.500 --> 32:52.220
but you really got to check that out.

32:52.220 --> 32:57.220
So, all right, moving on to something less humble.

32:57.820 --> 33:00.520
And wouldn't you know it, it's another story about Capcom.

33:00.520 --> 33:03.820
Like I hate to keep kicking these guys week after week,

33:03.820 --> 33:06.540
but something is up with the management at Capcom.

33:06.540 --> 33:09.340
Like something has really changed

33:09.340 --> 33:10.980
and not in a good way at Capcom.

33:10.980 --> 33:12.300
And wait until you hear this.

33:12.300 --> 33:14.100
Like we're going from Humble Indie Bundle,

33:14.100 --> 33:15.660
pay what you want to this story.

33:16.840 --> 33:21.100
Capcom is testing the waters in Japan on something.

33:21.100 --> 33:25.420
It's a demo of a game called Nazu Waka Yakata.

33:25.420 --> 33:27.900
It is a interesting title.

33:27.900 --> 33:29.980
It doesn't use buttons on the 3DS.

33:29.980 --> 33:32.060
It relies on sound and the microphone.

33:32.060 --> 33:33.900
There's like this little trailer

33:33.900 --> 33:35.940
that I'm playing in studio for the games.

33:35.940 --> 33:37.900
We can kind of look at it here,

33:37.900 --> 33:40.100
get the sense of what this game's all about.

33:41.580 --> 33:42.420
I guess you-

33:47.860 --> 33:49.540
I wonder if this is kind of like C-Man

33:49.540 --> 33:50.580
or something where you talk

33:50.580 --> 33:53.500
and interact with the on-screen characters.

33:53.500 --> 33:54.900
It's kind of the sense I get.

33:56.180 --> 33:57.180
It's like a creepy dude on screen.

33:57.180 --> 33:58.820
It's a ghost.

33:58.820 --> 34:03.820
He has no feet, he's a ghost.

34:04.060 --> 34:06.820
It's like you kind of like explore these rooms and talk.

34:07.780 --> 34:08.820
So that's the game, right?

34:08.820 --> 34:10.740
I don't know if it's something that's planned

34:10.740 --> 34:11.580
to come out here yet.

34:11.580 --> 34:12.420
Creepy children.

34:12.420 --> 34:13.380
That's right.

34:13.380 --> 34:15.500
Anyhow, why is this important?

34:15.500 --> 34:17.860
Because the demo that's coming out on the 3DS

34:17.860 --> 34:20.420
is going to cost 200 yen.

34:20.420 --> 34:21.500
That would be about the equivalent

34:21.500 --> 34:23.820
of $2.50 here in America.

34:23.820 --> 34:28.820
What we are talking about is a paid demo for the game.

34:28.980 --> 34:30.980
Now, granted, that's a cheap demo

34:30.980 --> 34:32.380
and one could argue that, well,

34:32.380 --> 34:35.100
you're still getting to play at least part of the game,

34:35.100 --> 34:38.780
but doesn't something strike you as really, really wrong

34:38.780 --> 34:40.700
about the concept of a paid demo,

34:40.700 --> 34:43.500
especially from a company that's thrived on

34:43.500 --> 34:45.860
great word of mouth from free demos throughout the years?

34:45.860 --> 34:47.540
Like, I don't know, Dead Rising.

34:47.540 --> 34:50.860
Like a lot of people decided they wanted that game

34:50.860 --> 34:51.740
based off the demo.

34:51.740 --> 34:53.980
Lost Planet, same type of thing, right?

34:53.980 --> 34:56.580
So why now a change in the strategy?

34:56.580 --> 34:59.100
Was this maybe a part of the whole,

34:59.100 --> 35:02.420
they were gonna charge for the Mega Man Legends 3 prototype,

35:02.420 --> 35:04.220
which was essentially a paid demo?

35:05.260 --> 35:06.420
Like, what is going on?

35:06.420 --> 35:08.460
What do you guys think of paid demos?

35:08.460 --> 35:09.540
Is it a rip?

35:09.540 --> 35:10.380
Or is it worth it?

35:10.380 --> 35:11.860
It depends on how much of the game you're getting.

35:11.860 --> 35:12.700
Yeah.

35:12.700 --> 35:16.500
Because if it is like a really in-depth demo,

35:16.500 --> 35:18.700
then yeah, I can see $2.50 forward.

35:18.700 --> 35:19.540
I mean, keep in mind,

35:19.540 --> 35:22.500
I used to get the PlayStation,

35:22.500 --> 35:23.820
people used to just basically buy

35:23.820 --> 35:26.180
the PlayStation Magazine thing for the demo discs.

35:26.180 --> 35:27.780
No, that's true, that's true.

35:27.780 --> 35:28.620
That's an interesting comparison.

35:28.620 --> 35:30.380
And the same was done with the Xbox Magazine,

35:30.380 --> 35:32.180
same was done with Dreamcast.

35:33.140 --> 35:36.140
Because I have a bunch of demo discs from magazines

35:36.140 --> 35:37.860
because I wanted to try out the game

35:37.860 --> 35:38.700
that was on the demo disc,

35:38.700 --> 35:40.340
and the only way you could get it was on the magazine.

35:40.340 --> 35:41.740
You still got a magazine, though.

35:41.740 --> 35:43.580
That was the thing, you're buying the magazine.

35:43.580 --> 35:46.100
Whether you're buying the magazine for the disc

35:46.100 --> 35:47.280
or buying it for whatever,

35:47.280 --> 35:48.860
that was paid for by advertisers.

35:48.860 --> 35:51.220
And you could say the disc is tangible.

35:51.220 --> 35:54.460
I mean, but it's an interesting comparison

35:54.460 --> 35:55.300
I haven't heard yet.

35:55.300 --> 35:56.660
Well, it's not the first time

35:56.660 --> 35:58.180
that they've done this kind of crap.

35:58.180 --> 36:00.500
I mean, look at, you know,

36:00.500 --> 36:03.820
you might even say like Dead Rising Case Zero

36:03.820 --> 36:06.900
or whatever was a paid demo.

36:06.900 --> 36:08.960
Because it's an Xbox Live Arcade game.

36:08.960 --> 36:13.740
Oh, I'm sorry, it was a prequel to Dead Rising 2.

36:13.740 --> 36:16.960
Yeah, whatever, okay, it was basically a demo.

36:16.960 --> 36:20.520
So you gave the demo a unique storyline

36:20.520 --> 36:22.560
that tied into the actual game.

36:22.560 --> 36:24.240
I kind of looked at it as DLC

36:24.240 --> 36:26.100
that didn't require the game.

36:26.100 --> 36:28.160
That's, and that's why I kind of let it slide.

36:28.160 --> 36:30.620
It was something extra that wasn't actually in the game

36:30.620 --> 36:32.240
that, you know, had its own achievements,

36:32.240 --> 36:33.720
it had its own ranking,

36:33.720 --> 36:35.720
it was its own kind of standalone thing.

36:35.720 --> 36:37.800
Well, what if, you know,

36:37.800 --> 36:40.280
for people who've bought the demo for the game,

36:40.280 --> 36:43.120
they get something cool when the actual game comes out?

36:44.880 --> 36:46.720
What if that's associated with it?

36:46.720 --> 36:48.580
Because we don't have that detail.

36:48.580 --> 36:49.420
You know, it's funny,

36:49.420 --> 36:51.120
kind of a similar comment we have in chat.

36:51.120 --> 36:52.620
Chalice's pop in our chat room says,

36:52.620 --> 36:54.440
if it was a pre-order bonus disc

36:54.440 --> 36:56.240
that came with a cash deposit,

36:56.240 --> 36:57.540
or I could use that money down

36:57.540 --> 36:59.440
against the retail version of the game,

36:59.440 --> 37:02.520
and I don't buy it my loss, then I'd be okay with it.

37:02.520 --> 37:04.680
But to buy a demo and then buy the retail version

37:04.680 --> 37:06.200
for full price, I don't know,

37:06.200 --> 37:09.520
I just wait for reviews and go straight to the retail.

37:09.520 --> 37:11.160
See, I think that they're gonna have to work out

37:11.160 --> 37:13.740
some sort of perk with that or it's gonna fail.

37:13.740 --> 37:16.200
They have to give people incentive to,

37:16.200 --> 37:19.000
especially for such a bizarre looking game.

37:19.000 --> 37:22.200
What an interesting way that digital distribution

37:22.200 --> 37:23.040
could go though.

37:23.040 --> 37:26.680
Imagine if, and I guess to some extent one could argue

37:26.680 --> 37:28.560
you kind of have this already with some things,

37:28.560 --> 37:33.160
but what if like you could play the first stage of a game

37:33.160 --> 37:36.120
by paying two bucks, and then if you like it,

37:36.120 --> 37:38.760
you buy the entire game for an extra 38?

37:38.760 --> 37:42.420
Isn't that kind of how the Xbox arcade thing?

37:42.420 --> 37:46.180
You don't pay for those demos.

37:46.180 --> 37:48.020
But since you brought up Xbox.

37:48.020 --> 37:50.060
But I mean you could pay a couple of levels

37:50.060 --> 37:52.380
and then if you had to do one of the game in your arcade,

37:52.380 --> 37:53.680
wasn't that like?

37:53.680 --> 37:54.520
Game room?

37:54.520 --> 37:55.360
Yeah.

37:55.360 --> 37:56.180
Sorta?

37:56.180 --> 37:57.020
Yeah.

37:57.020 --> 37:57.860
Kinda.

37:57.860 --> 37:58.680
Kinda.

37:58.680 --> 37:59.520
I don't know, game room was kind of its own thing.

37:59.520 --> 38:00.360
I get what you're going with that though.

38:00.360 --> 38:03.060
But I think more about Fable 2, I think they did this.

38:03.060 --> 38:06.300
I think they chopped up Fable 2 into like six chapters

38:06.300 --> 38:08.280
and they put it out as episodes.

38:08.280 --> 38:10.280
So they kinda did something like this.

38:10.280 --> 38:12.260
But I mean it was a while after the whole thing

38:12.260 --> 38:13.100
had already been released.

38:13.100 --> 38:13.940
Like they just wanted to sell

38:13.940 --> 38:16.340
as many freaking copies of that game any way they could.

38:16.340 --> 38:18.900
Slice it, dice it, circumcise it,

38:18.900 --> 38:21.540
whatever you gotta do to sell the game

38:21.540 --> 38:23.820
bit by bit, little by little.

38:23.820 --> 38:24.640
Yeah.

38:24.640 --> 38:25.480
So.

38:25.480 --> 38:26.320
Milk that franchise.

38:26.320 --> 38:27.820
Exactly.

38:27.820 --> 38:29.900
Dungeon Buster says Wolf 3D gave you

38:29.900 --> 38:31.380
the first few levels for free

38:31.380 --> 38:33.300
and then if you wanted the whole game then you paid.

38:33.300 --> 38:35.380
You didn't pay up front, same with Doom.

38:35.380 --> 38:38.300
One could argue that you might have paid

38:38.300 --> 38:39.140
for Wolfenstein 3D.

38:39.140 --> 38:41.420
No, I did pay for shareware.

38:41.420 --> 38:42.260
You had to buy the shareware disk.

38:42.260 --> 38:44.940
Because you used to have to buy the disks.

38:44.940 --> 38:47.220
You would go buy the floppies at the store

38:47.220 --> 38:48.860
that already had it on there.

38:48.860 --> 38:51.460
So that was fine, but here's the thing though

38:51.460 --> 38:53.660
about shareware for the most part.

38:53.660 --> 38:57.340
Shareware, you could enjoy the game as a whole

38:57.340 --> 38:58.620
with just the shareware.

38:58.620 --> 39:01.860
Like you would get one campaign of it I guess.

39:01.860 --> 39:03.800
But you could get the additional campaigns

39:03.800 --> 39:05.020
if you had the full disk.

39:05.020 --> 39:07.500
Like Wolfenstein, you play through the whole first campaign

39:07.500 --> 39:10.740
but there was four campaigns total with the full version.

39:10.740 --> 39:12.540
This is a demo.

39:12.540 --> 39:15.500
This is not, you know, part of the game.

39:15.500 --> 39:17.220
This is the demo.

39:18.900 --> 39:21.680
This is Capcom figuring out ways to be dicks.

39:22.780 --> 39:27.460
I mean, whether it's locking saves or weird DRM,

39:27.460 --> 39:29.940
it's their way of, you know,

39:29.940 --> 39:33.180
how can we make more money and fuck people over?

39:33.180 --> 39:35.140
Because that's what we do best, Capcom.

39:35.140 --> 39:38.100
Whoa, but this is not the same Capcom from a year ago

39:38.100 --> 39:40.220
that started Mega Man Legends in the first place.

39:40.220 --> 39:42.940
Is Bobby Kotick running Capcom for some reason?

39:42.940 --> 39:45.140
Did he like just all of a sudden,

39:45.140 --> 39:48.660
is he like Fred Savage where he wears

39:48.660 --> 39:50.380
a bunch of different skin suits?

39:50.380 --> 39:52.700
Did Activision buy Capcom and we just didn't hear?

39:52.700 --> 39:54.060
Like is that what happened?

39:55.740 --> 39:57.580
So, all right.

39:59.020 --> 40:01.580
Anyhow, I guess at the end of the day,

40:01.580 --> 40:03.860
if you don't like it, don't buy it.

40:03.860 --> 40:04.700
That's how they'll get the message.

40:04.700 --> 40:06.340
Well, it's a weird Japanese game

40:06.340 --> 40:07.820
that will probably never make it over here

40:07.820 --> 40:09.700
so that is easy enough.

40:09.700 --> 40:11.700
And I'm saying it to the Japanese listeners,

40:11.700 --> 40:13.340
all three of you.

40:13.340 --> 40:16.340
Let's see, Kitsune, Ikuma JP, and I think there's one other.

40:17.540 --> 40:20.220
All three of you, make a stand.

40:20.220 --> 40:24.120
Three out of three OLR listeners in Japan reject this game.

40:25.340 --> 40:26.460
All right, moving on.

40:27.620 --> 40:29.300
Well, how about some news about harmonics?

40:29.300 --> 40:30.980
We haven't really heard from them in a while, have we?

40:30.980 --> 40:32.000
I heart harmonics.

40:32.000 --> 40:32.840
What's new with harmonics?

40:32.840 --> 40:34.580
Whatever happened to that, sorry,

40:34.580 --> 40:35.660
I know this isn't what you're reporting on,

40:35.660 --> 40:37.340
but whatever happened to that freaking game

40:37.340 --> 40:38.560
they were supposed to announce at E3

40:38.560 --> 40:40.300
that kind of disappeared.

40:40.300 --> 40:44.580
What, you mean vid rhythm?

40:44.580 --> 40:45.620
Yeah, vid rhythm.

40:45.620 --> 40:47.920
They didn't say much about it.

40:47.920 --> 40:52.140
No real details yet, but anyway, they're happy.

40:52.140 --> 40:54.140
They like not being a part of Viacom

40:54.140 --> 40:57.260
or any other calm there is.

40:57.260 --> 41:00.140
In fact, Tracy Rosenthal Newsome,

41:00.140 --> 41:02.460
who is the VP of production,

41:02.460 --> 41:04.940
said it's been a terrific opportunity.

41:04.940 --> 41:07.860
And I quote, we are very well supported,

41:07.860 --> 41:09.460
but really the most important thing

41:09.460 --> 41:11.080
is that there's a huge amount of creative energy

41:11.080 --> 41:14.020
that has bubbled up during our independence.

41:14.020 --> 41:16.580
They've been in development of Dance Central 2

41:16.580 --> 41:18.900
and they're putting small games together,

41:18.900 --> 41:21.060
making prototypes and innovating.

41:21.060 --> 41:24.420
So they are still working on vid rhythm,

41:24.420 --> 41:26.460
which there's not too many details,

41:26.460 --> 41:30.300
but it's just been described as fun.

41:30.300 --> 41:31.420
They're not giving a timeline,

41:31.420 --> 41:33.740
but we'll be hearing about it soon is what she said.

41:33.740 --> 41:38.740
Well, vid rhythm is made up of vid and rhythm and fun.

41:40.940 --> 41:44.100
But right now the focus is on Rock Band DLC.

41:46.060 --> 41:47.100
And it's saying that Rock Band 3

41:47.100 --> 41:48.800
still has tons of life left in it.

41:50.820 --> 41:54.300
So we can be expecting, of course,

41:54.300 --> 41:57.500
Dance Central 2 on connect in fall.

41:59.140 --> 42:02.540
Any thoughts on possible Rock Band 4 next year?

42:02.540 --> 42:04.300
Or do you think, no, it's still too soon to bring?

42:04.300 --> 42:05.140
Thinks too soon.

42:05.140 --> 42:06.060
You think, really?

42:06.060 --> 42:06.900
Yeah.

42:09.020 --> 42:10.220
I really do think it is too soon.

42:10.220 --> 42:11.940
I was randomly thinking about that the other day

42:11.940 --> 42:14.100
as like, well, obviously all those games

42:14.100 --> 42:16.420
took this year off, except for Dance Central,

42:16.420 --> 42:18.420
but the plastic instrument games

42:18.420 --> 42:20.340
will say are taking the year off.

42:20.340 --> 42:25.240
And they're saying that Guitar Hero is not dead.

42:25.240 --> 42:26.980
I think they've said Rock Band's not dead,

42:26.980 --> 42:28.980
but they're all taking a break.

42:28.980 --> 42:31.540
But I wonder if it's a break until next year,

42:31.540 --> 42:33.260
or maybe it's gonna be a break long enough

42:33.260 --> 42:36.700
for the next wave of consoles as well.

42:36.700 --> 42:37.620
That's a good thought.

42:37.620 --> 42:40.820
I mean, I think right now is just they're really

42:40.820 --> 42:43.300
trying to avoid that oversaturation.

42:43.300 --> 42:45.700
They've got a good product now.

42:45.700 --> 42:47.120
They're still selling something

42:47.120 --> 42:49.820
without having to develop anything new right now.

42:49.820 --> 42:51.140
So as long as it's selling

42:51.140 --> 42:53.620
and as long as people keep buying the download packs,

42:53.620 --> 42:56.620
then there's no reason for them to make a new one yet.

42:56.620 --> 42:58.180
Well, and Dance Central 2

42:58.180 --> 43:00.540
is probably gonna sell really well.

43:00.540 --> 43:03.020
It'll probably stay a huge connect seller

43:03.020 --> 43:03.860
through the holidays.

43:03.860 --> 43:07.140
So I think everybody knows it, you know.

43:07.140 --> 43:08.340
First one was a quality connect.

43:08.340 --> 43:09.860
I like dance masters.

43:10.700 --> 43:11.540
Ew.

43:13.500 --> 43:15.380
All right, let's travel around the world

43:15.380 --> 43:16.460
and look at some release dates

43:16.460 --> 43:18.060
and see what you can get a whole lot sooner

43:18.060 --> 43:20.140
than the holidays as in next week.

43:20.140 --> 43:22.160
What's coming out next week in America?

43:25.260 --> 43:26.100
Not much of anything.

43:26.100 --> 43:27.660
Hasn't that been like this,

43:27.660 --> 43:29.900
the reaction for like the past four weeks?

43:29.900 --> 43:30.740
Well, no.

43:30.740 --> 43:31.580
Nothing has freaking come out of here.

43:31.580 --> 43:34.980
There was actually stuff last week

43:34.980 --> 43:36.480
or this week, I should say.

43:37.660 --> 43:40.260
No, the next week, there really is hardly anything.

43:40.260 --> 43:42.180
I mean, here's what we got

43:42.180 --> 43:43.380
and I'll run it down real quick.

43:43.380 --> 43:44.700
Wait, can I say this real quick though?

43:44.700 --> 43:45.720
It did make the show real tonight,

43:45.720 --> 43:46.780
but there was a big press release

43:46.780 --> 43:50.360
about how Catherine is Atlas's biggest launch seller ever.

43:50.360 --> 43:52.540
It's already sold like 200,000 copies.

43:52.540 --> 43:54.300
I gotta admit, there is this cynical part of me

43:54.300 --> 43:55.540
that's kind of like, you sold that much

43:55.540 --> 43:57.560
because there's nothing else to buy right now.

43:57.560 --> 44:00.480
There is nothing else.

44:00.480 --> 44:02.500
It also helps that you put a woman

44:02.500 --> 44:04.040
with large breasts on your...

44:04.040 --> 44:04.880
Yeah, that helps too.

44:04.880 --> 44:05.720
That does help too, yeah.

44:05.720 --> 44:08.560
And all the trailers have been, you know,

44:08.560 --> 44:10.100
her sleeping with a dude.

44:10.100 --> 44:13.320
It just shows, America wants porno games.

44:14.620 --> 44:15.860
Think about it.

44:15.860 --> 44:17.080
Yeah, they do.

44:19.300 --> 44:20.840
All right, here's what we got coming out next week.

44:20.840 --> 44:22.020
All DS titles.

44:22.020 --> 44:24.340
Touch and Play Collection on the Nintendo DS.

44:24.340 --> 44:25.420
It's a bunch of casual games.

44:25.420 --> 44:27.060
Hurrah.

44:27.060 --> 44:28.740
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.

44:28.740 --> 44:30.900
It's an adventure game on the DS.

44:30.900 --> 44:33.340
And Puzzler World 2.

44:33.340 --> 44:35.780
Once again, another collection of casual puzzle games.

44:35.780 --> 44:36.660
That is it.

44:36.660 --> 44:37.500
Done.

44:37.500 --> 44:39.820
Nothing else to report on.

44:39.820 --> 44:41.700
Is it because kids are getting ready to go back to school?

44:41.700 --> 44:43.260
No, it's just a dead week.

44:43.260 --> 44:44.100
I don't know.

44:44.100 --> 44:46.420
A week after there's some stuff.

44:47.780 --> 44:50.820
It's just, you know, I don't know.

44:50.820 --> 44:51.660
All right.

44:51.660 --> 44:52.800
Well, let's travel to Japan

44:52.800 --> 44:54.300
and look at the Japanese release dates.

44:54.300 --> 44:56.860
Let's see if it's a similar story over there.

44:56.860 --> 44:57.740
Well, I'll tell you this.

44:57.740 --> 45:00.320
On the Xbox 360 this week, nothing.

45:00.320 --> 45:03.020
Nothing coming out on the 360 this week.

45:03.020 --> 45:04.820
Going over to the PlayStation 3.

45:04.820 --> 45:08.660
WWE All-Stars is released this week from THQ.

45:08.660 --> 45:10.000
So, I guess you have that.

45:10.940 --> 45:14.140
Going to the Nintendo systems,

45:14.140 --> 45:16.440
seeing if there's anything coming out there.

45:18.540 --> 45:21.100
Actually, I have the PSP up first on my list.

45:21.100 --> 45:25.620
There's Monhuniki, Poka Poka, Ailou Muraji,

45:25.620 --> 45:29.720
and then Uta No, Prince Sama Repeat.

45:29.720 --> 45:31.420
Yes, those are the two games coming out.

45:31.420 --> 45:33.460
Uta means song or theme.

45:33.460 --> 45:35.580
That first one, the Monhuniki,

45:35.580 --> 45:39.740
is a farm, fish, and hunt monsters RPG on the PSP.

45:39.740 --> 45:41.940
And then the second one there is,

45:41.940 --> 45:45.780
it looks like it's from Broccoli.

45:45.780 --> 45:48.000
Oh, oh, oh, let me look at it.

45:48.000 --> 45:49.560
I thought Broccoli went into business.

45:49.560 --> 45:50.780
Nope, they're still there.

45:50.780 --> 45:53.180
And it looks like it might be like a...

45:53.180 --> 45:55.520
It's a dating sim for girls.

45:55.520 --> 45:56.360
Kinda.

45:56.360 --> 45:57.280
It's a pretty boy.

45:57.280 --> 45:59.000
Yeah, pretty boy dating sim.

45:59.000 --> 46:01.920
Theme of the Prince Repeat.

46:03.320 --> 46:04.580
Oh, it could be like a redo.

46:04.580 --> 46:05.880
If it's called Repeat,

46:05.880 --> 46:08.420
it could be like a re-release or something like that.

46:08.420 --> 46:09.600
Or a special edition.

46:09.600 --> 46:11.120
Whatever, I don't think anyone here

46:11.120 --> 46:12.480
is gonna be importing that.

46:13.400 --> 46:16.120
Kitsune, Ikuma, JP, any interest in that game?

46:17.120 --> 46:18.320
I'm thinking no.

46:18.320 --> 46:19.640
And that's it.

46:19.640 --> 46:20.720
You go to the Wii, there's nothing.

46:20.720 --> 46:23.320
3DS, Super Pokemon Scramble.

46:23.320 --> 46:24.640
I guess that's kind of a big deal.

46:24.640 --> 46:26.160
It is a Pokemon game coming out.

46:26.160 --> 46:29.240
It's not an official Pokemon black or white

46:29.240 --> 46:30.320
type of Pokemon game,

46:30.320 --> 46:32.780
but it is a Pokemon related universe game.

46:32.780 --> 46:34.720
That's probably the biggest release this week.

46:34.720 --> 46:36.960
Unless you wanna get a new pouch for your 3DS

46:36.960 --> 46:39.000
with Street Fighter characters on it.

46:39.000 --> 46:40.440
There you go.

46:40.440 --> 46:43.800
Your very busy release day schedule in Japan.

46:43.800 --> 46:44.880
How about your...

46:44.880 --> 46:46.300
There's a few things.

46:46.300 --> 46:49.080
Actually, today, I guess already,

46:49.080 --> 46:52.320
Dragon Quest Monsters Joker 2 came out.

46:52.320 --> 46:54.680
On the 10th, we have Fruit Ninja Connect,

46:54.680 --> 46:58.120
and Hysteria Project 2 for PSP and PlayStation 3.

46:58.120 --> 47:00.640
And on the 11th, we have Edge, and that's it.

47:02.040 --> 47:03.560
Meh.

47:03.560 --> 47:05.160
Thank God we do have some people in Japan

47:05.160 --> 47:06.520
who actually listen to this show.

47:06.520 --> 47:09.000
Kitsune actually is jumping in saying,

47:09.000 --> 47:12.880
Utuno Prince Sama is actually an anime in Japan.

47:12.880 --> 47:14.520
So it is an actual anime.

47:14.520 --> 47:16.320
Let's see, I'm actually trying to...

47:16.320 --> 47:21.320
Oh, opening theme.

47:28.320 --> 47:29.160
Looks very...

47:29.160 --> 47:30.080
Yeah, I wanna play that.

47:30.080 --> 47:30.920
Shoujo.

47:31.800 --> 47:32.640
I'll watch it.

47:32.640 --> 47:33.720
Ah.

47:33.720 --> 47:36.200
Just watching that trailer gave me a period.

47:36.200 --> 47:37.040
All right.

47:38.560 --> 47:39.920
No ice cream for you.

47:41.160 --> 47:42.280
Moving on.

47:42.280 --> 47:43.940
More gaming news, Loki.

47:43.940 --> 47:48.020
Ah, that's a very wonderful image.

47:50.300 --> 47:51.140
So...

47:51.140 --> 47:52.580
I got a uterus, let's make a baby.

47:56.180 --> 47:57.260
Chirp, chirp.

47:57.260 --> 48:02.260
Yes, the studio behind Minecraft, Mojang,

48:03.620 --> 48:06.940
they have been threatened with lawsuit

48:06.940 --> 48:11.740
over their new game called Scrolls.

48:11.740 --> 48:15.280
Apparently, Scrolls is a card game.

48:17.000 --> 48:20.340
Like a card RPG strategy game or whatever.

48:20.340 --> 48:24.820
And it kinda looks a little medieval-ish.

48:24.820 --> 48:26.220
And so Bethesda's saying,

48:26.220 --> 48:28.660
hey, that infringes on our own trademark,

48:28.660 --> 48:30.100
the Elder Scrolls.

48:34.740 --> 48:36.860
I don't know if I'd buy that.

48:36.860 --> 48:39.700
Because they have the monopoly on Scrolls.

48:39.700 --> 48:40.660
Exactly.

48:40.660 --> 48:41.900
That's what it is.

48:41.900 --> 48:44.140
This reminds me of, God, what was that?

48:44.140 --> 48:46.980
It was the Mirror's Edge stuff.

48:46.980 --> 48:48.220
And I think it was Edge,

48:48.220 --> 48:50.620
or something about using Edge in a game

48:50.620 --> 48:53.060
was inappropriate or whatever.

48:53.060 --> 48:54.180
The guys tried to sue.

48:54.180 --> 48:56.340
Oh, well, it's just like, was it Monster?

48:57.420 --> 49:00.560
Monster Cables, they sue everybody

49:00.560 --> 49:03.300
that uses the word monster and stuff.

49:03.300 --> 49:08.100
Even if it has nothing to do with cables,

49:08.100 --> 49:12.420
electronics, anything, yes.

49:12.420 --> 49:14.900
These people are what we call assholes.

49:16.120 --> 49:18.260
Or their lawyers are assholes.

49:18.260 --> 49:21.420
I'm sorry, when it's a generic,

49:21.420 --> 49:22.780
it would be different if it was like

49:22.780 --> 49:25.400
the Elder Cards or something like that.

49:25.400 --> 49:27.660
Okay, you got something there, maybe.

49:27.660 --> 49:30.920
But if a word scrolls,

49:30.920 --> 49:34.820
which no one owns a trademark to the word scrolls,

49:34.820 --> 49:36.500
you have the Elder Scrolls.

49:36.500 --> 49:41.500
If it was like the Elder Card Scrolls battle game.

49:41.540 --> 49:44.540
The Elder Parchments, Armageddon.

49:45.980 --> 49:47.780
You know, if it was something like that,

49:47.780 --> 49:49.860
then yeah, you might have a case.

49:49.860 --> 49:52.420
But it's just too damn generic.

49:52.420 --> 49:54.120
And honestly, I don't think they're gonna win,

49:54.120 --> 49:57.120
even if they did end up going through with a lawsuit.

49:57.120 --> 49:59.640
They're just playing the tactic right now

49:59.640 --> 50:02.000
where it's like, oh, we're big bad Bethesda.

50:03.580 --> 50:05.900
You know, we're gonna file a lawsuit against you,

50:05.900 --> 50:09.100
so you little indie developer better do what we want.

50:09.100 --> 50:11.380
Why do big companies have to be bullies like that?

50:11.380 --> 50:14.860
It's kind of a double-edged sword everywhere.

50:14.860 --> 50:17.140
It's basically, they have to protect

50:17.140 --> 50:19.860
their intellectual properties,

50:19.860 --> 50:21.580
but at the same time, they kind of overstep

50:21.580 --> 50:24.100
their boundaries and try to go after people

50:24.100 --> 50:25.780
that really aren't trying to infringe

50:25.780 --> 50:27.300
on their intellectual properties,

50:27.300 --> 50:29.500
and that's what's going on here.

50:29.500 --> 50:32.420
It's because the people that make the games

50:32.420 --> 50:34.840
aren't necessarily the suits and the lawyers

50:34.840 --> 50:36.460
that are actually going after these people.

50:36.460 --> 50:39.640
It's separate entities altogether.

50:43.020 --> 50:43.860
All right.

50:45.420 --> 50:48.460
Clearly, this will get settled out of court,

50:48.460 --> 50:49.760
which means they're probably gonna end up

50:49.760 --> 50:51.900
being forced to change the name, and then that's it,

50:51.900 --> 50:53.180
which is ridiculous.

50:53.180 --> 50:55.340
I hope they kind of stick to their guns and don't do it.

50:55.340 --> 50:56.920
Call it mind scrolls.

50:56.920 --> 50:57.760
There you go.

50:59.260 --> 51:00.140
All right, let's move on,

51:00.140 --> 51:03.000
talk about some Kinect news related on the Xbox.

51:03.000 --> 51:05.060
Apparently, a rating has been spotted

51:05.060 --> 51:08.020
for Kinect Fun Labs Air Band.

51:08.020 --> 51:11.620
I guess that is the next Fun Lab that's gonna come out.

51:11.620 --> 51:14.600
Did you guys know that that whole Be in a Talk Show thing

51:14.600 --> 51:15.600
came out for Fun Labs?

51:15.600 --> 51:16.440
I have yet to play it.

51:16.440 --> 51:17.280
Fun Labs, what?

51:17.280 --> 51:18.520
And I guess Sparkler's out too.

51:18.520 --> 51:19.360
Huh?

51:19.360 --> 51:22.020
I thought that was Avatar Kinect,

51:22.020 --> 51:23.780
not, you know, that was something separate.

51:23.780 --> 51:25.300
That's what it's called, Avatar Kinect.

51:25.300 --> 51:27.060
Yeah, that came out, and then the Sparkler thing

51:27.060 --> 51:28.420
that they were showing at E3 came out.

51:28.420 --> 51:29.260
I haven't played either one.

51:29.260 --> 51:31.140
Yeah, I don't care about either one of those.

51:31.140 --> 51:32.880
Dark Soccer, at some point, you should take your Kinect

51:32.880 --> 51:33.780
out of the box.

51:33.780 --> 51:34.620
It'll work a lot better.

51:34.620 --> 51:37.000
As soon as someone lends me as dance masters.

51:37.000 --> 51:37.840
No.

51:37.840 --> 51:39.300
You said you were gonna lend it to me.

51:39.300 --> 51:41.100
You have Kinect adventures to play.

51:41.100 --> 51:41.940
Go rafting.

51:41.940 --> 51:44.020
No, don't go rafting.

51:45.020 --> 51:46.760
You can do Avatar Kinect.

51:46.760 --> 51:50.200
You can host your own Oprah show as your avatar.

51:52.940 --> 51:56.160
You can do Kinect, okay, okay, Kinect Sparkler.

51:56.160 --> 51:58.380
It's kind of like having fire in your hands.

51:59.260 --> 52:00.100
You don't like fire?

52:00.100 --> 52:01.580
I don't want to para para.

52:01.580 --> 52:03.980
It's kind of like if fire was lame.

52:07.180 --> 52:10.260
And really, you know, how can you make fire lame?

52:10.260 --> 52:11.740
You can't, but yet,

52:12.860 --> 52:16.400
Kinect's Fun Labs manages to make fire lame.

52:16.400 --> 52:17.260
All right, so I guess,

52:17.260 --> 52:19.020
Kinect Fun Labs Air Band's probably coming.

52:19.020 --> 52:21.460
I want to say, when they did the whole voting

52:21.460 --> 52:23.540
on the different, like, labs to come out,

52:23.540 --> 52:26.380
wasn't one of them like a keyboard that you could play,

52:26.380 --> 52:28.300
like, in that scene from Big,

52:28.300 --> 52:30.780
but you didn't actually need a keyboard on the ground?

52:30.780 --> 52:32.100
Like, that was one of the whole,

52:32.100 --> 52:33.260
that's what this sounds like.

52:33.260 --> 52:34.600
Oh, I really hope it is.

52:34.600 --> 52:35.440
I really hope it is,

52:35.440 --> 52:38.140
because I could relive that scene from Big

52:38.140 --> 52:39.160
over and over again,

52:39.160 --> 52:42.300
and I will be the life of my own party.

52:42.300 --> 52:43.140
Hold on, though.

52:43.140 --> 52:44.660
In about another year,

52:44.660 --> 52:46.620
wouldn't something like that entertain Josh

52:46.620 --> 52:48.140
for, like, 15 minutes at least?

52:48.140 --> 52:48.980
No.

52:48.980 --> 52:49.820
No?

52:51.500 --> 52:52.780
It's not even a babysitter?

52:52.780 --> 52:53.620
No.

52:53.620 --> 52:54.500
No?

52:54.500 --> 52:55.340
No.

52:56.220 --> 52:58.220
Connect-O-Moles would entertain him,

52:58.220 --> 53:01.820
but, you know, Kinect Fun Labs, no.

53:01.820 --> 53:03.420
It's just like, hey, look, haha,

53:03.420 --> 53:04.540
look at all these indie guys

53:04.540 --> 53:05.940
who are doing all these hacks and stuff.

53:05.940 --> 53:08.060
We want a piece of that action, you know?

53:08.060 --> 53:09.740
Come to Kinect, because it's fun.

53:09.740 --> 53:11.760
It's whimsical.

53:13.360 --> 53:17.020
No, all this shit's gonna be is fucking Wii music, okay?

53:17.020 --> 53:20.580
That's all this bullshit Wii music.

53:20.580 --> 53:23.460
God, even saying the word Wii music

53:23.460 --> 53:27.300
just flashes me back to the E3 press conference

53:27.300 --> 53:31.380
where Miyamoto comes out playing a fucking fake,

53:31.380 --> 53:34.060
you know, saxophone thing, and how lame that was.

53:34.060 --> 53:36.560
It's just like, ah, it burns!

53:37.560 --> 53:38.900
It's so terrible.

53:38.900 --> 53:39.860
It's like you're suffering from

53:39.860 --> 53:41.980
post-traumatic stress disorder or something.

53:41.980 --> 53:45.920
I'm suing Nintendo, PTSD from their damn conference.

53:47.780 --> 53:48.620
All right, well, I don't know

53:48.620 --> 53:50.340
if you'll wanna sue Microsoft over this,

53:50.340 --> 53:53.540
but they are trying to put out more Kinect games.

53:53.540 --> 53:56.020
They are actually saying one Kinect-enabled

53:56.020 --> 53:58.540
Xbox Live Arcade game a month.

53:58.540 --> 54:00.660
That's something they're trying to do there.

54:01.540 --> 54:05.860
That is according to product marketing manager Robin Burrow.

54:05.860 --> 54:08.740
Quote, we're targeting a frequency of about one a month

54:08.740 --> 54:10.300
for Xbox Live Arcade portfolio

54:10.300 --> 54:11.920
that will have Kinect integration.

54:11.920 --> 54:14.860
That will be really powerful and differentiate the platform.

54:14.860 --> 54:17.700
Of course, coming out very soon, Fruit Ninja Kinect.

54:17.700 --> 54:19.340
We'll kick things off.

54:19.340 --> 54:22.920
Fruit Ninja Kinect, eh, that's stupid, silly fun.

54:22.920 --> 54:24.980
But some of the other stuff that they had,

54:24.980 --> 54:27.500
you know, like the new Burnout game,

54:27.500 --> 54:29.620
just makes me wanna cry.

54:29.620 --> 54:34.220
It's just, it's Burnout, a great franchise,

54:34.220 --> 54:37.100
great racing game, and we have this top-down thing

54:37.100 --> 54:39.700
where I gotta hop up and down to make my car explode.

54:41.260 --> 54:42.620
Lame.

54:42.620 --> 54:46.020
This isn't Micro Machines, this is fucking Burnout.

54:46.020 --> 54:47.540
If I wanna play Micro Machines,

54:47.540 --> 54:51.640
the top-down racing game from like the 90s,

54:51.640 --> 54:54.940
I'd play Micro Machines, maybe 80s.

54:54.940 --> 54:56.180
Might be before the 90s.

54:57.380 --> 54:58.540
Freaking John Machida.

55:00.220 --> 55:01.740
That's what I'm talking about.

55:03.060 --> 55:05.480
All right, let's move on, I guess,

55:05.480 --> 55:06.900
to the classic game of the week.

55:06.900 --> 55:09.900
We're just running through the news tonight.

55:09.900 --> 55:11.260
It's kind of a slow news week.

55:11.260 --> 55:12.560
It's hard to fill a three-hour show

55:12.560 --> 55:14.900
when there's not too much going on outside of

55:15.860 --> 55:17.500
kids going back to school and so forth,

55:17.500 --> 55:20.260
especially, look at what's coming out

55:20.260 --> 55:21.880
this week in games, nothing.

55:21.880 --> 55:25.380
So why not go back and revisit a classic?

55:25.380 --> 55:26.380
Every week here on the show,

55:26.380 --> 55:28.420
Dark Sakura takes a step into the vault,

55:28.420 --> 55:30.060
finds a classic video game that she thinks,

55:30.060 --> 55:35.060
hey, you ungrateful brats, study this.

55:35.060 --> 55:36.180
It's a classic video game of the week.

55:36.180 --> 55:37.580
Dark Sakura, what game did you pick

55:37.580 --> 55:38.420
for your classic video games?

55:38.420 --> 55:39.860
I picked a really fucked up game,

55:39.860 --> 55:41.340
game series, I should say.

55:41.340 --> 55:42.420
Black Matrix.

55:43.300 --> 55:45.300
It's actually Black Slash Matrix.

55:45.300 --> 55:46.540
Is that like Keanu Reeves?

55:46.540 --> 55:48.780
Whoa, I know what a fool.

55:48.780 --> 55:52.300
It's actually a tactical RPG series.

55:53.180 --> 55:55.420
And it's sort of like,

55:56.260 --> 55:58.020
it kind of does like a mimicking

55:58.020 --> 55:59.860
of Christian religious themes,

55:59.860 --> 56:01.700
but it's kind of different.

56:01.700 --> 56:03.360
It has heaven, hell, earth,

56:03.360 --> 56:05.140
and all the people that live there.

56:05.140 --> 56:07.980
And the first one came out in 1998

56:07.980 --> 56:09.740
for the Sega Saturn.

56:09.740 --> 56:13.040
And it was just so weird.

56:13.040 --> 56:15.820
Okay, first of all, you play as

56:15.820 --> 56:20.220
a different character who belongs

56:20.220 --> 56:22.460
to a dominatrix of some sort.

56:22.460 --> 56:24.760
And then you fight, sort of like,

56:26.540 --> 56:27.940
you've got your move, your attack,

56:27.940 --> 56:30.620
your item, that's all a turn-based

56:30.620 --> 56:32.580
strategy game type of game.

56:32.580 --> 56:34.700
I didn't really quite get into it,

56:34.700 --> 56:36.300
but it had a very interesting story,

56:36.300 --> 56:37.580
I should put it that way.

56:37.580 --> 56:40.500
You also had counters, you could defend,

56:40.500 --> 56:42.180
you could dodge attacks.

56:42.180 --> 56:44.260
You also had a waiting attack.

56:44.260 --> 56:46.380
You also had magic commands.

56:46.380 --> 56:50.340
You also had different spell effectiveness

56:50.340 --> 56:51.780
that changed from turn to turn

56:51.780 --> 56:54.620
that was controlled by biorhythms.

56:54.620 --> 56:57.260
You had, instead of magic points,

56:57.260 --> 56:59.300
you had blood points, and you can distribute

56:59.300 --> 57:01.860
your blood points to all the usable characters

57:01.860 --> 57:03.740
to use for their spell casting.

57:03.740 --> 57:07.580
And you get more by attacking defeated enemies.

57:07.580 --> 57:11.800
So you basically kill them and steal their blood.

57:11.800 --> 57:14.520
And then you can actually put blood points

57:14.520 --> 57:18.840
into weapons to unleash a special attack,

57:18.840 --> 57:20.920
called its latent ability,

57:20.920 --> 57:23.760
or you could make it more effective.

57:23.760 --> 57:25.600
You could add different types of damage

57:25.600 --> 57:28.480
that the weapon would deal.

57:28.480 --> 57:31.520
And then after each battle, you get a letter grade rank,

57:31.520 --> 57:32.760
depending on how well you did.

57:32.760 --> 57:35.680
And so you get bonus items, money, and experience,

57:35.680 --> 57:37.960
depending on how well you did in battle,

57:37.960 --> 57:40.000
which I thought was a really cool system.

57:40.000 --> 57:42.640
So basically, the main character of the first one

57:42.640 --> 57:45.800
is named Abel, who is an amnesiac,

57:45.800 --> 57:50.240
and he is the main protagonist of Black Matrix.

57:51.280 --> 57:55.920
He's basically an angel, and he's locked up in the prison

57:55.920 --> 57:57.260
for the crime of love.

57:58.360 --> 58:02.560
And he can change Black Wings into White Wings

58:02.560 --> 58:03.800
and all kinds of different stuff.

58:03.800 --> 58:06.320
And then you get your different masters,

58:06.320 --> 58:07.640
your dominatrixes.

58:07.640 --> 58:10.600
You know, you have Domina, Purica,

58:10.600 --> 58:13.720
Michette, Purecious, and Prague.

58:14.760 --> 58:17.840
So, who I always used to just call plague.

58:17.840 --> 58:21.120
But you also could get a male master named Zero

58:21.120 --> 58:23.060
who was available after a code.

58:23.060 --> 58:24.680
So you have all kinds of different ones.

58:24.680 --> 58:27.420
Then Black Matrix 2 came out.

58:28.420 --> 58:29.640
Actually, let me go back.

58:29.640 --> 58:33.560
I should actually talk about Black Matrix AD Advanced,

58:33.560 --> 58:37.560
and then Black Matrix Cross are in the same series.

58:37.560 --> 58:39.960
They're the same game, pretty much.

58:39.960 --> 58:42.560
They just add different elements to the game.

58:42.560 --> 58:44.440
So I forgot to mention those.

58:44.440 --> 58:46.840
And then we got, okay, Black Matrix 2 came out

58:46.840 --> 58:50.240
for the PlayStation 2 on March 28th, 2002,

58:50.240 --> 58:52.680
and it's set in the hell realm.

58:52.680 --> 58:55.240
And it's, again, more of the same stuff.

58:55.240 --> 58:58.440
You have, instead, though, you have your main character

58:58.440 --> 59:00.400
who was like the strongest devil in hell,

59:00.400 --> 59:01.320
and then he got amnesia.

59:01.320 --> 59:02.760
Oops.

59:02.760 --> 59:05.160
And so, you know, it has,

59:05.160 --> 59:07.420
the story actually revolves around that.

59:07.420 --> 59:08.880
Then there was Black Matrix Zero,

59:08.880 --> 59:12.240
which is actually listed as Zero Zero.

59:12.240 --> 59:15.020
They came out on May 13th, 2004 on the PlayStation.

59:15.020 --> 59:18.360
And again, like all the other ones,

59:18.360 --> 59:20.200
it was only out in Japan.

59:20.200 --> 59:23.560
And it's a prequel to the other Black Matrix games.

59:25.540 --> 59:27.560
And that's pretty much it.

59:27.560 --> 59:30.100
You really cannot get them in English

59:30.100 --> 59:33.640
unless someone has managed to do some kind of patch.

59:33.640 --> 59:38.600
And they're really fucked up games.

59:38.600 --> 59:41.160
Also, they have great music.

59:41.160 --> 59:43.760
I do have to say that, like, that one right there.

59:44.880 --> 59:47.120
That's the, that's Zero Zero, isn't it?

59:49.480 --> 59:50.880
Yeah, this is First Battle.

59:51.840 --> 59:53.000
It's got great music.

59:53.000 --> 59:54.680
It's one thing I did like about these games

59:54.680 --> 59:56.720
is it had fantastic music.

59:56.720 --> 59:59.280
But it's just the themes are really, really dark.

01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:02.760
Brightman in chat wants to know who made this game.

01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:03.740
Cheech or Chong?

01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:07.120
That wasn't funny.

01:00:08.040 --> 01:00:10.600
It actually came out by Flight Plan.

01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:12.720
And it was published by Inter Channel

01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:16.080
in case anyone actually was curious for a real reason.

01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:20.640
One of the titles actually did get considered

01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:23.840
for a North American release.

01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:28.240
However, because of the religious themes in it,

01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:32.280
I would actually have to say pretty sacrilegious things

01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:35.160
in it, it got the boot.

01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:37.280
I think we were supposed to get-

01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:39.520
Could they have just changed the art or something?

01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:41.240
And I don't know.

01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:43.760
Isn't there other ways they can kind of get around it?

01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:45.000
They can release anime with that.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:46.760
They should be able to release a video game with that.

01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:49.880
The Flight Matrix just had a pretty interesting story.

01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:52.640
And yeah, but the first one was really, in my opinion,

01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:54.240
the best, because you have to work

01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:56.080
for your dominatrix mistress.

01:00:56.080 --> 01:00:57.960
And you choose your mistress, by the way,

01:00:57.960 --> 01:00:59.400
at the beginning of the game.

01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:01.440
Sexy.

01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:03.600
Yeah, so that's it.

01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:05.960
All right, there it is, your classic game of the week.

01:01:05.960 --> 01:01:09.480
Black Matrix, that's black slash matrix.

01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:12.440
And good luck finding that one to play.

01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:14.040
I have a friend who's got the Saturn version.

01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:16.480
But think about it, you'll learn Japanese while you play,

01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:18.240
because it's not in English at all.

01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:19.460
So good luck with that.

01:01:19.460 --> 01:01:22.440
All right, but a good trip down memory lane nonetheless,

01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:24.720
on a one that I'm sure most people listening

01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:27.040
probably have never heard of, so there you go.

01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:28.040
All right, anyhow, that's gonna do it

01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:29.240
for the first half of our show tonight.

01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:31.520
Don't go anywhere, guys, we still have plenty to go here

01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:33.000
tonight on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:34.480
Some rapid fire news when we get back.

01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:35.600
We gotta talk about what happened

01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:37.400
on Blizzard's call this week.

01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:39.320
Some really interesting updates on Diablo 3,

01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:40.880
as well as World of Warcraft.

01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:43.780
Another lawsuit involving Band Hero.

01:01:43.780 --> 01:01:47.280
And you're never gonna believe this story about Skyrim.

01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:49.440
It actually has nothing to do with the game.

01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:50.280
Just wait for it.

01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:51.720
We'll talk about all that when we come back

01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:55.160
with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:59.320
["Orange Lounge Radio Theme Song"]

01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:03.920
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:06.320
We are live on this Sunday evening,

01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:11.040
August the 7th, if I lose my calendar right, of 2011,

01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:15.320
where we're taping the 423rd episode of our show.

01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:17.080
I'm starting to lose count, oh my gosh.

01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:18.280
Anyhow, we're gonna get back

01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:20.560
into some rapid fire news tonight,

01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:22.280
and do some quick stories for you guys.

01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:23.880
Luke, you start us off.

01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:26.940
All right, so let's see, starting things off,

01:02:26.940 --> 01:02:28.920
let's talk a little bit about Borderlands 2,

01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:31.440
which I'm very excited that got announced.

01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:34.900
That'll be coming out sometime after March 2012.

01:02:34.900 --> 01:02:39.900
It's gonna be the next fiscal year for Take Two.

01:02:39.900 --> 01:02:43.600
And it's pretty awesome.

01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:47.240
They had a little bit of a tease in the new Game Informer.

01:02:47.240 --> 01:02:49.600
Some of the details, I've kind of bleeped out about it

01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:52.000
so far, one of the new playable characters

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.960
is gonna be Salvador the Dwarf, he is what they call

01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:58.000
a Gunzerker, basically a guy that's able

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.780
to dual wield weapons, which is pretty cool.

01:03:00.780 --> 01:03:03.440
And of course they're saying that there's gonna be

01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:08.440
better AI, as well as the old NPC character,

01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:11.280
or the old characters from the first game

01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:13.520
are gonna be NPC characters in this new game.

01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:18.600
Yeah, it looks awesome, I can't wait to check it out.

01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:23.400
The first game was just amazing.

01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:27.460
Of course, DC Universe Online is doing pretty well.

01:03:27.460 --> 01:03:30.800
Right now they're going to be merging some servers

01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:34.700
into mega servers, and this is gonna be happening on Monday.

01:03:35.660 --> 01:03:37.540
That doesn't strike me as news you hear

01:03:37.540 --> 01:03:39.180
when a game's doing well.

01:03:39.180 --> 01:03:41.480
Well, whatever, well is the subjective term.

01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:42.420
I guess so.

01:03:42.420 --> 01:03:47.420
Apparently they're previously held as super servers.

01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:50.900
Mega servers will give the player's ability

01:03:50.900 --> 01:03:55.640
to switch between PVP and PVE styles of gameplay.

01:03:55.640 --> 01:04:00.640
And, I don't know, I guess before it was maybe.

01:04:02.180 --> 01:04:04.180
Oh hey, apparently we're playing Listis tonight,

01:04:04.180 --> 01:04:05.980
except we're not, sorry about that.

01:04:05.980 --> 01:04:08.580
I think maybe before they were, you had to switch

01:04:08.580 --> 01:04:10.780
actual servers, you had to have a player on each server

01:04:10.780 --> 01:04:12.980
in order to do that, I'm not sure.

01:04:12.980 --> 01:04:16.500
But right now the servers are set to be merged

01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:20.040
into four mega servers, one PC, one PS3 server

01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:25.040
for the US with twin servers in the European regions.

01:04:25.220 --> 01:04:27.780
So wow, that's interesting.

01:04:27.780 --> 01:04:30.380
So I guess if you're playing in the US,

01:04:30.380 --> 01:04:32.420
you'll be playing with everybody in the US.

01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:35.460
All five other people that are playing

01:04:35.460 --> 01:04:37.100
DC Universe right now.

01:04:37.100 --> 01:04:37.940
Yeah.

01:04:37.940 --> 01:04:39.980
I'm just mad, DC Universe players

01:04:39.980 --> 01:04:41.420
are gonna write angry emails to the show.

01:04:41.420 --> 01:04:43.700
I'm not, I'm only being half serious.

01:04:43.700 --> 01:04:47.060
I mean, I don't know many people at all

01:04:47.060 --> 01:04:49.100
that are playing it, but obviously some people are.

01:04:49.100 --> 01:04:50.580
I don't know anyone that plays EverQuest either,

01:04:50.580 --> 01:04:51.980
but that game's still going.

01:04:53.420 --> 01:04:56.180
Although, the way things are right now though

01:04:56.180 --> 01:04:58.740
with all the server merges, some players

01:04:58.740 --> 01:05:01.720
will be forced to change their names after the merge,

01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:03.500
since two characters cannot exist

01:05:03.500 --> 01:05:05.400
with the same name on the same server.

01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:10.400
So now you'll have to be xxxseparath69xxx, yeah.

01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:19.600
And then finally, the first jailbreak,

01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:22.700
or PS3 jailbreak raid in South Africa

01:05:22.700 --> 01:05:24.220
has one man arrested.

01:05:25.660 --> 01:05:28.460
Didn't even know they were still going after people there.

01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:32.940
So apparently they raided this guy in Park Town

01:05:32.940 --> 01:05:37.280
and confiscated $14,000 worth of computers,

01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:41.160
PS3s, hard drives, jailbreak software, USB kits,

01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:45.160
and fake PS2 games and original PS3 games.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.560
And they said one man was taken into custody

01:05:48.560 --> 01:05:52.700
at the Special Commercial Crimes Court, but made bail.

01:05:54.980 --> 01:05:57.720
What exactly is the crime that these folks are committing?

01:05:57.720 --> 01:05:59.160
Jailbreaking the PS3?

01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:01.380
Yeah, jailbreaking the PS3.

01:06:01.380 --> 01:06:04.640
Which really shouldn't be a crime in the first place.

01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:06.360
I guess it's a different country,

01:06:06.360 --> 01:06:09.040
but I thought when it came at least to this country,

01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:10.380
they found in a court of law

01:06:10.380 --> 01:06:11.880
that you can jailbreak your phone.

01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:12.720
Your iPhone.

01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:14.540
Well your phone, yeah, because that's added

01:06:14.540 --> 01:06:17.800
to a list of devices that it's okay and legal

01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:20.400
to do that with, however the PlayStation 3

01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:22.240
is not one of those devices.

01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:25.880
Now they were hoping the whole GeoHats thing

01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:28.480
that it would actually go to trial

01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:30.800
and he would be found innocent,

01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:32.280
which case would set a precedent

01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:34.880
that it's okay to jailbreak that stuff.

01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:38.900
Of course, him being a pussy also backed out of everything

01:06:38.900 --> 01:06:41.020
and they settled out of court

01:06:41.020 --> 01:06:43.320
so he can get his job at Sony or whatever.

01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:47.100
And so there's no precedent set there.

01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:51.040
I don't think he works at Sony actually.

01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:52.320
Yeah, he works at Facebook,

01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:53.960
but who cares, he's still pussy.

01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:57.360
But you're not mad, not at all.

01:06:57.360 --> 01:06:58.360
Oh, I don't care.

01:06:58.360 --> 01:07:00.320
All right, there's no reason for me

01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:02.280
to jailbreak my PS3.

01:07:02.280 --> 01:07:03.640
Don't play enough games on it.

01:07:03.640 --> 01:07:05.080
All right, let me do some quick stories here.

01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:06.960
One of them has to do with that 3D TV.

01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:09.520
Remember this announcement at E3 from Sony?

01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:10.400
Turned a lot of heads.

01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:12.840
They were gonna be selling a 3D TV

01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:16.000
that came with the TV, obviously it was like a monitor,

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:20.060
glasses, an HDMI cable, and a copy of Resistance 3

01:07:20.060 --> 01:07:22.680
and it was all gonna be $499, right?

01:07:22.680 --> 01:07:24.480
Well, it's not really gonna come

01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:26.760
with Resistance 3 anymore.

01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:28.240
That's changed a little bit.

01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:30.040
So they've decided now it's going to be

01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:33.640
MotorStorm Apocalypse instead of Resistance 3.

01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:37.480
Perhaps they want folks to buy the game separately.

01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:39.080
Maybe they don't wanna be giving it away.

01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:41.200
Perhaps that MotorStorm Apocalypse didn't sell

01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:42.880
as well as they had planned and they are sitting

01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:45.120
on a ton of them and they need to get rid of them.

01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:48.000
You also get a free copy of E.T. for the Atari 2600.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:49.060
Go figure.

01:07:49.060 --> 01:07:50.480
They're just throwing that in there for free.

01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:52.160
I don't know how Sony got ahold of them.

01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:53.000
I guess they moved their corporate offices to New Mexico.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:54.400
No, don't get me wrong.

01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:57.400
In MotorStorm Apocalypse, it's sad that it didn't sell

01:07:57.400 --> 01:07:59.280
as well as they had hoped.

01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:00.240
It's a great game.

01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:04.000
It's just, you know, I think people were hoping

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:05.240
to get Resistance 3.

01:08:05.240 --> 01:08:08.080
Although, I'm not sure if it made our show roll,

01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:11.040
but if you pre-order through GameStop,

01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:14.520
you still do get Resistance 3 and MotorStorm Apocalypse.

01:08:15.560 --> 01:08:17.560
But that would require pre-ordering through GameStop.

01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:18.400
Yes. And I hate them so much.

01:08:18.400 --> 01:08:21.180
Why would you pre-order a TV through GameStop?

01:08:21.180 --> 01:08:22.020
Don't do that.

01:08:22.020 --> 01:08:23.840
Do not be tempted by this.

01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:25.040
Amazon will match it.

01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:26.800
Somebody will match it.

01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:27.640
Just wait.

01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:30.880
Anyhow, let's see.

01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:33.960
Apparently, there was a statement made to GameSpot

01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:36.720
that, not GameStop, but GameSpot.

01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:41.000
I want to start a website called GamePots,

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:44.720
because apparently there's this every way,

01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:46.720
which way you can rearrange that word.

01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:49.120
MotorStorm Apocalypse, it will have the full screen,

01:08:49.120 --> 01:08:51.240
but split screen functionality.

01:08:51.240 --> 01:08:53.280
Remember that whole, you know, 3D,

01:08:53.280 --> 01:08:55.080
but one person will see one screen

01:08:55.080 --> 01:08:56.320
and one will see the other. Yeah, I played that.

01:08:56.320 --> 01:08:58.320
That's going to be in MotorStorm Apocalypse.

01:08:58.320 --> 01:09:02.080
Yeah, I played with MLB 11, the show,

01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:03.960
which I really didn't want to play MLB.

01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:06.080
See, they had a demonstration during our little

01:09:06.080 --> 01:09:07.040
Game of Summit thing.

01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:09.400
I wanted to play MotorStorm.

01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:14.180
But no, the two guys working the booth decided,

01:09:14.180 --> 01:09:16.220
hey, we're a fan of baseball.

01:09:16.220 --> 01:09:18.280
We're going to play baseball.

01:09:18.280 --> 01:09:20.760
You know, it's about us, not the consumer.

01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:23.880
So I played that, and it works.

01:09:23.880 --> 01:09:27.120
Yeah, I don't know.

01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:28.600
All right, well, some other stories here,

01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:31.760
one of them about Lollipop Chainsaw.

01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:34.280
I love it based on the name alone.

01:09:34.280 --> 01:09:36.600
It's a cheerleader versus zombie game.

01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:37.840
It's by Grasshopper.

01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:39.520
They didn't know more heroes, right?

01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:41.680
That tells you all you need to know right there.

01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:43.960
Lollipop Chainsaw, it's going to be released

01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:45.560
outside of Japan in 2012.

01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:47.340
Warner Brothers Interactive is going to be

01:09:47.340 --> 01:09:48.180
the ones publishing it.

01:09:48.180 --> 01:09:49.840
That was announced this week.

01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:53.320
There's also a partnership now with Kadokawa Games

01:09:53.320 --> 01:09:55.700
that Warner Brothers will have moving forwards.

01:09:55.700 --> 01:09:58.280
So more cheerleaders fighting more zombies.

01:09:58.280 --> 01:10:00.280
Hooray.

01:10:00.280 --> 01:10:02.640
Hopefully they'll put money into the marketing

01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:04.600
and the game will sell.

01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:07.800
Also, one other interesting acquisition this week,

01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:11.960
Square Enix has got the rights to True Crime Hong Kong.

01:10:11.960 --> 01:10:13.960
They got the rights from Activision.

01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:16.600
You might remember that Activision canceled this game

01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:18.560
some time ago, True Crime Hong Kong.

01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:21.560
And Square Enix, they said, quote,

01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:23.520
when we first saw and got our hands on the game,

01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:25.080
we fell in love with it.

01:10:25.080 --> 01:10:27.680
That quote from Square Enix London Studios

01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:29.600
general manager, Lee Singleton.

01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:31.880
It's a great big bucket of fun.

01:10:31.880 --> 01:10:33.960
I think it's a good idea that they picked it up.

01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:36.000
I don't know why Activision got rid of it.

01:10:37.640 --> 01:10:39.760
But whatever.

01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:42.640
Now you might be wondering, Square Enix and True Crime?

01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:43.480
What the heck?

01:10:43.480 --> 01:10:45.000
Does that mean Cloud is coming to the game?

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:45.840
No, no, no, no, no.

01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:48.520
Don't forget Square Enix now includes Eidos

01:10:48.520 --> 01:10:51.300
and this would not be out of the realm of possibility

01:10:51.300 --> 01:10:54.600
for that group that brought what, Deus Ex

01:10:54.600 --> 01:10:55.680
and some of those other games

01:10:55.680 --> 01:10:58.200
that now fall under the Square Enix banner.

01:10:58.200 --> 01:10:59.240
There you go.

01:10:59.240 --> 01:11:00.540
Dark Sakura.

01:11:00.540 --> 01:11:01.860
We have some other stuff.

01:11:02.940 --> 01:11:07.940
Just Dance 3 is getting a Just Create mode

01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:11.400
that lets players record their own choreography

01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:14.480
and challenge online and offline players to fit it.

01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:17.160
But it's just practice right now.

01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:19.480
There's a trailer out for it.

01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:22.000
I'm ambivalent, of course.

01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:26.100
And then we have very sad news.

01:11:26.100 --> 01:11:30.440
This makes me sniffle because the CEO

01:11:30.440 --> 01:11:35.440
and founder of Game Arts, Takeshi Miyagi,

01:11:37.280 --> 01:11:39.560
actually died on July 29th.

01:11:39.560 --> 01:11:42.920
And I've reviewed a number of games

01:11:42.920 --> 01:11:44.880
that have come out of Game Arts,

01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:49.880
including Grandia, Silfied, Lunar, and very sad.

01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:53.280
He will be succeeded by Ryu Okuriyama,

01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:55.680
who is a CEO of Gaia Holdings.

01:11:56.900 --> 01:12:00.220
And last little bit for rapid fire

01:12:00.220 --> 01:12:02.480
is there are pre-order skins available

01:12:02.480 --> 01:12:05.580
for the new Batman Arkham City game

01:12:05.580 --> 01:12:09.540
that are gonna be related to wherever you happen

01:12:09.540 --> 01:12:12.600
to pre-order them from and there will be download content.

01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:14.120
It's not, it hasn't said yet though

01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:16.640
these are gonna be available to everybody,

01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:18.640
maybe through a purchase or whatever.

01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:20.200
But the different ones that they have

01:12:20.200 --> 01:12:23.720
is that you can have the 1970s Batman skin,

01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:28.720
which is through shop2.net and Toys R Us.

01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:32.040
Shop2.net by the way is UK retailer.

01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:34.600
You can get the Batman Beyond skin

01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:39.440
through gamestop.co.uk or mightyape.co.nz.

01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:41.760
That's New Zealand or UK.

01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:45.340
You also get the Dark Knight Returns skin,

01:12:45.340 --> 01:12:48.220
which will be if you buy it at any store,

01:12:48.220 --> 01:12:50.660
if you buy the collector's edition at any store.

01:12:50.660 --> 01:12:52.380
There's the animated series version

01:12:52.380 --> 01:12:54.500
that is if you get it from Mighty Apes,

01:12:54.500 --> 01:12:56.640
that's again New Zealand.

01:12:56.640 --> 01:12:59.580
There's Earth One Batman, which is again through Mighty Ape.

01:12:59.580 --> 01:13:02.580
And then there is the Robin Batman,

01:13:02.580 --> 01:13:06.100
which is available through Best Buy or gamesmania.be,

01:13:06.100 --> 01:13:09.660
which is Holland or JB Hi-Fi for Australia.

01:13:09.660 --> 01:13:11.500
I want the Adam West Batman.

01:13:11.500 --> 01:13:12.340
It's there.

01:13:12.340 --> 01:13:13.160
It looks pretty cool.

01:13:13.160 --> 01:13:14.000
I know.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:14.840
Where do I get that in-

01:13:14.840 --> 01:13:15.900
I'll leave the picture to the chat room.

01:13:15.900 --> 01:13:18.260
Yeah, but where do I get that in America?

01:13:18.260 --> 01:13:19.100
Pre-ordering that from.

01:13:19.100 --> 01:13:21.860
That one is Toys R Us.

01:13:21.860 --> 01:13:23.100
Okay, I can do that.

01:13:23.100 --> 01:13:24.600
Like I said, the 1970s Batman.

01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:26.180
I don't have burning hatred for Toys R Us,

01:13:26.180 --> 01:13:27.020
so that'll work.

01:13:28.580 --> 01:13:29.420
Besides-

01:13:29.420 --> 01:13:30.260
It's actually more like the comic-

01:13:30.260 --> 01:13:31.780
I can go be a Toys R Us kid.

01:13:31.780 --> 01:13:34.460
It's more like the 1970s comic version,

01:13:34.460 --> 01:13:36.460
but that was the same as the Adam West one.

01:13:36.460 --> 01:13:38.060
Yeah, it's Adam West Batman to me.

01:13:38.060 --> 01:13:39.180
That's the one I wanna play.

01:13:39.180 --> 01:13:41.460
Except you know he doesn't have the drawn on eyebrows.

01:13:41.460 --> 01:13:42.820
That or animated series.

01:13:42.820 --> 01:13:44.460
I like the animated series one too.

01:13:44.460 --> 01:13:45.280
It's pretty cool.

01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:46.120
That's in there.

01:13:46.120 --> 01:13:48.700
I gotta say that Michael Keaton one's kinda awesome too.

01:13:48.700 --> 01:13:49.520
That one way on the right.

01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:50.420
Is that Michael Keaton Batman?

01:13:50.420 --> 01:13:52.380
The one on the far right is actually,

01:13:52.380 --> 01:13:54.340
I do believe the Robin Batman.

01:13:54.340 --> 01:13:56.100
No, that's on the far left, isn't it?

01:13:56.100 --> 01:13:57.340
No, that's Batman Beyond.

01:13:57.340 --> 01:13:58.420
Oh.

01:13:58.420 --> 01:14:00.300
So in order on this one,

01:14:00.300 --> 01:14:01.180
let me see if I get it right.

01:14:01.180 --> 01:14:02.800
You have from left to right.

01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:04.460
You have the Batman Beyond one.

01:14:04.460 --> 01:14:08.940
You have the Dark Knight Returns.

01:14:08.940 --> 01:14:12.540
You have Earth One 1970s animated series

01:14:12.540 --> 01:14:14.000
and Robin's Batman.

01:14:15.220 --> 01:14:16.540
Just keep in mind Dick Grayson

01:14:16.540 --> 01:14:17.820
took over as Batman for a while.

01:14:17.820 --> 01:14:19.220
You know who they have,

01:14:19.220 --> 01:14:21.980
or know who one of the characters is gonna be

01:14:21.980 --> 01:14:24.120
that they haven't announced yet, right?

01:14:24.120 --> 01:14:27.520
Nightwing actually is gonna be one of the characters.

01:14:27.520 --> 01:14:28.460
Which is awesome.

01:14:28.460 --> 01:14:30.300
Shaping up to be more and more awesome.

01:14:30.300 --> 01:14:32.580
Well then let me see something real quick.

01:14:32.580 --> 01:14:34.000
Well I just wanna say quickly in our chat room,

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.820
Brakeman in the chat room at chat.orangelaunchy.com says,

01:14:36.820 --> 01:14:39.320
can I get George Clooney Nipple Batman?

01:14:39.320 --> 01:14:41.220
Actually I was incorrect.

01:14:41.220 --> 01:14:43.640
Robin gets the Red Robin skin.

01:14:43.640 --> 01:14:44.700
I was incorrect.

01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:47.420
It's not, the picture of it's not available.

01:14:47.420 --> 01:14:51.700
Red Robin as in the mascot for wonderful Burger Chain?

01:14:51.700 --> 01:14:52.540
No.

01:14:52.540 --> 01:14:53.700
Because that would be hilarious.

01:14:54.960 --> 01:14:57.620
That's almost as cool as fighting as the Burger King.

01:14:58.660 --> 01:14:59.780
I'm finding a picture.

01:15:00.680 --> 01:15:01.940
There was a video that someone did,

01:15:01.940 --> 01:15:04.300
a mock him of.

01:15:04.300 --> 01:15:07.100
It was like the Burger King,

01:15:07.100 --> 01:15:08.540
I don't even know what the fuck it was.

01:15:08.540 --> 01:15:10.820
Somehow someone made the Burger King even creepier

01:15:10.820 --> 01:15:12.980
and he was in oblivion.

01:15:12.980 --> 01:15:14.300
Okay there's a picture in the chat room

01:15:14.300 --> 01:15:16.780
of what Red Robin looks like from the comics.

01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:19.760
You know I don't know if I could support

01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:21.700
George Clooney Nipple Batman being in the game

01:15:21.700 --> 01:15:23.980
because that means that Mr. Freeze might show up

01:15:23.980 --> 01:15:26.020
and it might be really bad.

01:15:26.020 --> 01:15:27.820
Allow me to break the ice.

01:15:27.820 --> 01:15:31.900
Cold, freeze, cold, freeze, cold.

01:15:31.900 --> 01:15:34.620
Frozen ice, cold gel.

01:15:34.620 --> 01:15:36.900
Killing winter ice, winter ice.

01:15:36.900 --> 01:15:38.820
Chill, cold ice, shut up.

01:15:38.820 --> 01:15:40.740
Cold, freeze, chill, freeze.

01:15:40.740 --> 01:15:42.700
Winter ice, cold, cold ice.

01:15:42.700 --> 01:15:44.580
Crosswind ice, freezing ice.

01:15:44.580 --> 01:15:47.820
Cool, freeze, freeze, freeze, freeze.

01:15:47.820 --> 01:15:50.700
Freeze, freeze, freeze, freeze.

01:15:50.700 --> 01:15:53.620
Let's kick some ice.

01:15:54.460 --> 01:15:55.980
That's the former governor of California

01:15:55.980 --> 01:15:57.020
ladies and gentlemen.

01:15:57.020 --> 01:16:02.020
I love that shit.

01:16:04.420 --> 01:16:08.100
Okay I put in another picture of Batman versus Red Robin.

01:16:08.100 --> 01:16:10.300
It's not quite showgirls bad though.

01:16:10.300 --> 01:16:11.540
That's the problem.

01:16:11.540 --> 01:16:13.860
Showgirls bad is so bad it's kind of good.

01:16:13.860 --> 01:16:15.880
But that's just bad.

01:16:17.700 --> 01:16:18.820
It's just awesome.

01:16:20.940 --> 01:16:23.360
All right some quick plugs.

01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:26.060
Check out one of our other shows we produce.

01:16:26.060 --> 01:16:28.540
The Best Little Hoard House in Azeroth.

01:16:28.540 --> 01:16:30.620
www.hoardhouse.com.

01:16:30.620 --> 01:16:31.900
It's all things World of Warcraft.

01:16:31.900 --> 01:16:33.340
Which funny enough we're actually getting

01:16:33.340 --> 01:16:35.100
into a couple blizzard stories coming up here.

01:16:35.100 --> 01:16:37.980
But there are things that go beyond just wow

01:16:37.980 --> 01:16:39.580
and possibly affecting some other games too.

01:16:39.580 --> 01:16:41.800
So a little bit of crossover tonight going on.

01:16:41.800 --> 01:16:44.660
I do want to remind folks too that we are still recruiting

01:16:44.660 --> 01:16:47.600
indie games to spotlight on the show.

01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:48.760
We're gonna have a new segment.

01:16:48.760 --> 01:16:52.600
I don't think it'll debut next week but maybe in two weeks.

01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:54.540
We're gonna have a new segment dedicated to indie games

01:16:54.540 --> 01:16:55.680
here on the show.

01:16:55.680 --> 01:16:58.500
Very similar to kind of what we do for the classic games.

01:16:58.500 --> 01:17:00.160
We're hoping to talk to some indie developers

01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:02.460
and spotlight more indie games here on the show.

01:17:02.460 --> 01:17:04.460
Obviously we've talked a lot about the Humble Indie Bundle

01:17:04.460 --> 01:17:06.820
tonight which is a great place to start.

01:17:06.820 --> 01:17:08.500
But we want to try and talk to some of the developers

01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:11.740
themselves if you or anyone you know is developing

01:17:11.740 --> 01:17:15.000
an indie game either for the PC, a homebrew thing,

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.980
maybe for the iOS or Xbox Live independent games.

01:17:17.980 --> 01:17:20.740
I know it's very hard to stand out on Xbox Live

01:17:20.740 --> 01:17:21.580
that's for sure.

01:17:21.580 --> 01:17:24.300
So come get some exposure on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:17:24.300 --> 01:17:25.460
We don't charge for it.

01:17:25.460 --> 01:17:26.860
I don't think I made that clear last week

01:17:26.860 --> 01:17:29.580
but it's we'll do it because we like your game

01:17:29.580 --> 01:17:31.820
not because we're getting any money off it.

01:17:31.820 --> 01:17:33.540
So email us.

01:17:33.540 --> 01:17:36.840
You can email the show at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com

01:17:36.840 --> 01:17:38.860
or you can get into contact with us on Twitter

01:17:38.860 --> 01:17:40.360
at twitter.com slash O-L-R.

01:17:40.360 --> 01:17:41.700
You can email me directly if you want.

01:17:41.700 --> 01:17:42.900
Rob at orangeloungeradio.com

01:17:42.900 --> 01:17:44.180
because I'll be producing the new segment.

01:17:44.180 --> 01:17:46.740
So it'll be fun.

01:17:46.740 --> 01:17:47.860
All right, moving on.

01:17:47.860 --> 01:17:49.500
Let's get into some other news.

01:17:49.500 --> 01:17:51.840
And I mentioned Blizzard a minute ago.

01:17:51.840 --> 01:17:53.660
There's some big stuff that came out of Blizzard

01:17:53.660 --> 01:17:55.380
on an earnings call this week, right Loki?

01:17:55.380 --> 01:17:57.760
And it's just where Blizzard goes,

01:17:57.760 --> 01:18:01.300
the industry may in fact follow, correct?

01:18:01.300 --> 01:18:02.140
Yeah.

01:18:02.140 --> 01:18:08.260
So they announced a few things about Diablo 3.

01:18:08.260 --> 01:18:11.740
First off, Diablo 3 is going to feature player

01:18:11.740 --> 01:18:15.500
to player real money auction houses as well

01:18:15.500 --> 01:18:17.340
for virtual items.

01:18:17.340 --> 01:18:22.980
So you're going to be able to play this game, find items

01:18:22.980 --> 01:18:26.220
or whatever, and then sell them for real money or I think

01:18:26.220 --> 01:18:28.060
in-game currency as well.

01:18:28.060 --> 01:18:29.820
I think you'll be given the option either.

01:18:29.820 --> 01:18:32.700
And Blizzard will take fixed fees.

01:18:32.700 --> 01:18:35.020
They didn't say what it is, but they'll be nominal.

01:18:35.020 --> 01:18:40.780
And out of the sale price, both when the auction goes up

01:18:40.780 --> 01:18:44.620
for sale and when it's sold, and then when an item's sold,

01:18:44.620 --> 01:18:47.520
players will be able to keep their money in a Battle.net

01:18:47.520 --> 01:18:51.540
account for spending on Blizzard products and services

01:18:51.540 --> 01:18:55.620
are cashed out entirely with another percentage-based fee,

01:18:55.620 --> 01:18:58.180
although not yet announced, third-party payment provider.

01:19:03.180 --> 01:19:05.020
Yeah, that's interesting.

01:19:05.020 --> 01:19:09.340
Then, you know, if that's not good enough,

01:19:09.340 --> 01:19:13.500
Diablo 3 is going to require a permanent online connection.

01:19:13.500 --> 01:19:15.660
That's right.

01:19:15.660 --> 01:19:18.300
You're not going to be able to play the single-player portion

01:19:18.300 --> 01:19:21.820
of the game unless you are connected to Battle.net.

01:19:25.140 --> 01:19:27.660
One of the things that they felt was really important

01:19:27.660 --> 01:19:30.260
was that if you did play offline,

01:19:30.260 --> 01:19:32.620
you start a character, you get them all the way to level 20

01:19:32.620 --> 01:19:36.020
or 30 or 40 or what have you, and then at some point

01:19:36.020 --> 01:19:37.660
you might decide to venture onto Battle.net.

01:19:37.660 --> 01:19:40.020
But if you had to start a character from scratch,

01:19:40.020 --> 01:19:42.460
because there's no way for us to guarantee no cheats were

01:19:42.460 --> 01:19:45.700
involved, if we let you play on the client

01:19:45.700 --> 01:19:48.820
and then take the character online.

01:19:48.820 --> 01:19:51.380
So basically, their whole thing is,

01:19:51.380 --> 01:19:52.780
if you're connected to Battle.net,

01:19:52.780 --> 01:19:57.100
there must be no way that you can cheat at all.

01:19:57.100 --> 01:20:00.420
Well, it certainly would be a lot harder, that's for sure.

01:20:00.420 --> 01:20:03.900
I mean, exploits will be found in the game one way or another.

01:20:03.900 --> 01:20:07.240
But this is tricky.

01:20:07.240 --> 01:20:09.380
Obviously, I have to watch Blizzard very closely,

01:20:09.380 --> 01:20:11.740
because I spend a lot of time playing World of Warcraft.

01:20:11.740 --> 01:20:15.620
I will buy Diablo 3, because I loved Diablo 2.

01:20:15.620 --> 01:20:18.180
In some ways, the reason why I like World of Warcraft so much

01:20:18.180 --> 01:20:20.180
is that it almost plays more like Diablo than it

01:20:20.180 --> 01:20:23.540
does the RTS Warcraft games.

01:20:23.540 --> 01:20:25.900
So this is all news that definitely impacts,

01:20:25.900 --> 01:20:28.980
relevant to my interests, as they say.

01:20:28.980 --> 01:20:31.060
So I think a large part of what they're

01:20:31.060 --> 01:20:34.500
doing with the online connectivity and the fact

01:20:34.500 --> 01:20:37.660
that they say you can't cheat or whatever,

01:20:37.660 --> 01:20:40.620
is that they do have huge problems in Diablo 2,

01:20:40.620 --> 01:20:45.700
with folks cloning items and buying characters

01:20:45.700 --> 01:20:51.300
that are made in China and so forth by shady ways,

01:20:51.300 --> 01:20:54.180
getting the characters all leveled up, cheating, duping

01:20:54.180 --> 01:20:56.280
is a huge thing, and hacking and so forth.

01:20:56.280 --> 01:20:57.700
That game has been hacked to shit.

01:20:57.700 --> 01:20:59.700
And it makes a lot of people not want to play online,

01:20:59.700 --> 01:21:01.780
because the experience is just screwed up.

01:21:01.780 --> 01:21:04.500
Think about, if that becomes a problem,

01:21:04.500 --> 01:21:07.500
it's going to screw up their entire game, because yeah,

01:21:07.500 --> 01:21:09.420
OK, we're assuming that, or they're

01:21:09.420 --> 01:21:11.800
making the assumption that if it's connected to the battle

01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:17.740
now all the time, that's going to eliminate cheating.

01:21:17.740 --> 01:21:19.280
I don't think that's possible.

01:21:19.280 --> 01:21:20.660
I don't think it's going to eliminate cheating,

01:21:20.660 --> 01:21:22.020
but it's going to cut it way, way, way, way back.

01:21:22.020 --> 01:21:23.020
Well, you're going to have a problem, though,

01:21:23.020 --> 01:21:24.780
with people, if they're duplicating items

01:21:24.780 --> 01:21:26.980
and they're selling them for real money.

01:21:26.980 --> 01:21:28.380
But they're not going to be able to duplicate items,

01:21:28.380 --> 01:21:29.340
because they're always connected.

01:21:29.340 --> 01:21:30.860
And the system is going to look out for that shit

01:21:30.860 --> 01:21:31.780
and ban them instantly.

01:21:31.780 --> 01:21:32.700
You never know.

01:21:32.700 --> 01:21:36.500
The real problem is people that buy this shit.

01:21:36.500 --> 01:21:38.940
Like, if you buy gold for these games,

01:21:38.940 --> 01:21:40.420
or you've bought one of these characters,

01:21:40.420 --> 01:21:42.580
you're part of the reason this is happening.

01:21:42.580 --> 01:21:44.180
And let's be real, you've probably

01:21:44.180 --> 01:21:45.540
had your credit card stolen, too,

01:21:45.540 --> 01:21:48.420
because a lot of those companies like to do both.

01:21:48.420 --> 01:21:50.540
They sell you the info and then sell your credit card

01:21:50.540 --> 01:21:52.180
information to somebody else.

01:21:52.180 --> 01:21:53.900
But whatever.

01:21:53.900 --> 01:21:56.940
Makes you happy, I guess.

01:21:56.940 --> 01:21:57.520
I don't know.

01:21:57.520 --> 01:21:59.660
And then the whole real money auction house thing

01:21:59.660 --> 01:22:03.980
is just the weirdest thing I've ever heard in my life.

01:22:03.980 --> 01:22:07.320
At the same time, if people weren't buying this shit

01:22:07.320 --> 01:22:09.460
somewhere else, they wouldn't have

01:22:09.460 --> 01:22:11.100
to do something like this, I guess.

01:22:11.100 --> 01:22:13.140
I think they're just trying to get a slice of it.

01:22:13.140 --> 01:22:15.780
But here's the weird thing about it for me.

01:22:15.780 --> 01:22:17.220
Well, A, I'm never going to use it.

01:22:17.220 --> 01:22:19.300
I will not use the real money auction house,

01:22:19.300 --> 01:22:21.060
because I don't really want to support it.

01:22:21.060 --> 01:22:23.100
And A, I don't want to buy this stuff on there.

01:22:23.100 --> 01:22:24.380
It seems ridiculous.

01:22:24.380 --> 01:22:26.780
And B, Blizzard's going to charge a listing fee

01:22:26.780 --> 01:22:27.900
if you sell.

01:22:27.900 --> 01:22:29.940
Like, part of me wonders if Blizzard isn't going

01:22:29.940 --> 01:22:32.420
to profit off false dreams.

01:22:32.420 --> 01:22:34.060
That they're going to profit off people

01:22:34.060 --> 01:22:37.220
trying to list all these items for sale that will never sell.

01:22:37.220 --> 01:22:38.540
I know a lot of people that are saying,

01:22:38.540 --> 01:22:41.260
yeah, I'll sell items on there and make money.

01:22:41.260 --> 01:22:44.340
I don't hear anyone say, I'll buy the items off there

01:22:44.340 --> 01:22:45.180
and make money.

01:22:45.180 --> 01:22:47.500
Well, here's some other things that you need to consider too.

01:22:49.820 --> 01:22:53.300
This listing amount of money, or whatever they're taking,

01:22:53.300 --> 01:22:56.160
I can guarantee it's not an in-game currency.

01:22:57.460 --> 01:22:58.980
So that means you're going to have to have

01:22:58.980 --> 01:23:00.820
your credit card in there somewhere.

01:23:03.340 --> 01:23:04.180
Maybe that's not a big deal.

01:23:04.180 --> 01:23:06.600
Which you already do if you play WoW anyway.

01:23:06.600 --> 01:23:09.260
So, you know, Battle.net probably has it already.

01:23:09.260 --> 01:23:11.820
And a lot of people that are going to come play Diablo 3

01:23:11.820 --> 01:23:14.180
are probably already playing WoW.

01:23:14.180 --> 01:23:16.180
So, the weird thing is, you know,

01:23:16.180 --> 01:23:18.400
I know Blizzard has swore up and down

01:23:18.400 --> 01:23:20.400
they have their legal asses covered.

01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:21.780
So whatever, that's fine.

01:23:21.780 --> 01:23:25.100
But it strikes me as very odd

01:23:25.100 --> 01:23:26.640
that let's say, hypothetically,

01:23:26.640 --> 01:23:29.500
somebody could sell enough items

01:23:29.500 --> 01:23:31.580
that they make a significant amount of money on this.

01:23:31.580 --> 01:23:32.800
I don't think anybody's going to make more

01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:34.260
than maybe 20 bucks on this stuff.

01:23:34.260 --> 01:23:37.540
But let's say somebody does make a fair amount of money

01:23:37.540 --> 01:23:38.740
off some of these items.

01:23:39.700 --> 01:23:42.700
Wouldn't they have to claim taxes on that at some point?

01:23:42.700 --> 01:23:44.660
Like, wouldn't forms have to be filed by Blizzard,

01:23:44.660 --> 01:23:46.220
or I guess whoever their third party is,

01:23:46.220 --> 01:23:47.980
that they're going to get involved on some of that?

01:23:47.980 --> 01:23:49.740
Can you be taxed on not real items?

01:23:49.740 --> 01:23:52.940
And then that's where the whole internet gambling thing

01:23:52.940 --> 01:23:56.140
comes into play is that there's no fine,

01:23:56.140 --> 01:24:00.980
I mean, Blizzard controls the drop rate of these items

01:24:00.980 --> 01:24:02.220
that they're then going to turn around

01:24:02.220 --> 01:24:03.320
and charge you to sell.

01:24:03.320 --> 01:24:07.540
Something about that seems really devious to me.

01:24:07.540 --> 01:24:12.060
Like, there's not a check and balance to that.

01:24:12.060 --> 01:24:13.380
Like, Blizzard is going to control-

01:24:13.380 --> 01:24:14.540
It's insider trading.

01:24:14.540 --> 01:24:16.900
Yeah, that's what it is, it's insider trading.

01:24:16.900 --> 01:24:18.840
Like, that's legal?

01:24:19.740 --> 01:24:21.580
Okay, I think it's only legal

01:24:21.580 --> 01:24:23.060
because it hasn't really been done yet.

01:24:23.060 --> 01:24:26.420
But I think this is going to catch somebody's eye.

01:24:26.420 --> 01:24:28.320
This is going to catch the eye of a Leland Yee

01:24:28.320 --> 01:24:31.580
or somebody out there that's wanting, you know,

01:24:31.580 --> 01:24:33.300
the same way online gambling did.

01:24:33.300 --> 01:24:34.140
They're just-

01:24:34.140 --> 01:24:36.180
It just doesn't add up to me.

01:24:38.540 --> 01:24:39.500
SHA100Matt says,

01:24:39.500 --> 01:24:41.700
"'Rob, this is the same company that got a ton of suckers

01:24:41.700 --> 01:24:43.460
"'to pay $20 for a dumb mount on.'"

01:24:43.460 --> 01:24:44.900
Wow, true.

01:24:44.900 --> 01:24:45.740
Very true.

01:24:46.660 --> 01:24:48.220
I never bought the dumb mount, just so you know.

01:24:48.220 --> 01:24:50.140
The only thing I ever bought were the charity pets.

01:24:50.140 --> 01:24:51.940
They were charity, just so you know.

01:24:54.380 --> 01:24:55.200
But,

01:24:57.540 --> 01:25:00.220
I know some people who did buy those mounts

01:25:00.220 --> 01:25:01.180
and they quite enjoy them.

01:25:01.180 --> 01:25:03.540
They spend a lot of money on them.

01:25:03.540 --> 01:25:05.780
And at the same time, I'm not going to tell a person

01:25:05.780 --> 01:25:07.140
what they should and shouldn't spend their money on

01:25:07.140 --> 01:25:09.140
to make them happy, right?

01:25:09.140 --> 01:25:12.620
And if a fake little star pony that flies

01:25:12.620 --> 01:25:14.220
makes you happy, then go for it.

01:25:16.140 --> 01:25:18.860
I wouldn't pay for tower bucks and tiny tower either,

01:25:18.860 --> 01:25:20.520
but I still play the game.

01:25:20.520 --> 01:25:21.360
Yeah.

01:25:22.220 --> 01:25:23.660
I don't know.

01:25:23.660 --> 01:25:26.420
Let's see, going into some other comments from chat,

01:25:27.600 --> 01:25:28.480
Dungeon Buster says,

01:25:28.480 --> 01:25:31.100
"'I'm surprised that they didn't opt to let players into making

01:25:31.100 --> 01:25:34.380
a separate profile for off an online play.'"

01:25:34.380 --> 01:25:36.540
Me too, but maybe they were worried about things like

01:25:36.540 --> 01:25:41.540
blurring the lines or whatever, and leave it open to abuse.

01:25:41.700 --> 01:25:43.260
Shlace's pop in chat says,

01:25:43.260 --> 01:25:45.380
"'That issue has come up before with Second Life,

01:25:45.380 --> 01:25:48.560
where people were making tangible income for digital goods

01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:51.540
on their skins, house, digital assets design

01:25:51.540 --> 01:25:52.820
that they put the time into making

01:25:52.820 --> 01:25:54.500
and then selling on PayPal.

01:25:54.500 --> 01:25:56.580
The IRS had no idea what to do with it.'

01:25:56.580 --> 01:25:58.060
But you can look up news articles about it.

01:25:58.060 --> 01:26:00.660
It was a big deal when Second Life was still relevant."

01:26:03.460 --> 01:26:06.580
Yeah, I'm really interested to see where this goes.

01:26:06.580 --> 01:26:07.420
I don't know.

01:26:07.420 --> 01:26:08.240
Well, here's my thing.

01:26:08.240 --> 01:26:10.460
And this is with the whole IRS stuff.

01:26:10.460 --> 01:26:14.700
If they're gonna tax you on in-game currency that you make,

01:26:14.700 --> 01:26:16.300
then I should be able to pay those taxes

01:26:16.300 --> 01:26:17.740
with in-game currency.

01:26:17.740 --> 01:26:19.460
Because that's always been the problem.

01:26:19.460 --> 01:26:21.700
They're trying to associate a value to this stuff.

01:26:21.700 --> 01:26:22.820
Like say, for example,

01:26:22.820 --> 01:26:27.020
I sell some items in Diablo 3

01:26:27.020 --> 01:26:32.020
and earn 20,000 Blizzard space bucks

01:26:32.300 --> 01:26:35.340
or whatever they're gonna be under there.

01:26:35.340 --> 01:26:40.000
And then somehow that translates to $15,000

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:40.840
or something like that.

01:26:40.840 --> 01:26:42.500
But if I never cash that stuff out,

01:26:42.500 --> 01:26:44.820
I mean, it's digital.

01:26:44.820 --> 01:26:47.540
It's not really worth that kind of money.

01:26:47.540 --> 01:26:50.000
But if they're gonna charge me that,

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.220
then why should I have to pay in real money

01:26:52.220 --> 01:26:54.340
if it's not real money that I'm earning?

01:26:54.340 --> 01:26:55.860
You know what I mean?

01:26:55.860 --> 01:26:56.700
Well, keep in mind there are

01:26:56.700 --> 01:26:59.100
the two completely separate auction houses.

01:26:59.100 --> 01:27:00.580
And there's gonna be the auction house

01:27:00.580 --> 01:27:02.620
that runs completely off in-game currency.

01:27:02.620 --> 01:27:03.660
I'll use that.

01:27:03.660 --> 01:27:04.500
Why not?

01:27:04.500 --> 01:27:06.460
I use it and wow, it's a great system.

01:27:06.460 --> 01:27:07.560
I like it.

01:27:07.560 --> 01:27:09.820
I don't pay real money to use it.

01:27:09.820 --> 01:27:11.200
Besides, I guess one could argue

01:27:11.200 --> 01:27:12.700
my monthly subscription fee.

01:27:12.700 --> 01:27:14.140
And that's something we got into talking about

01:27:14.140 --> 01:27:15.980
on Hoard House this week is that

01:27:15.980 --> 01:27:18.580
before you cash out through this third party vendor,

01:27:18.580 --> 01:27:20.820
the dollar and cents is in your Blizzard wallet

01:27:20.820 --> 01:27:21.860
for lack of a better term.

01:27:21.860 --> 01:27:23.700
We don't know exactly what it's called yet.

01:27:23.700 --> 01:27:26.380
You could essentially pay for your monthly wow fee

01:27:26.380 --> 01:27:28.340
off selling games in Diablo.

01:27:28.340 --> 01:27:30.260
Because you could use the money in your Blizzard wallet

01:27:30.260 --> 01:27:32.220
to buy other Blizzard services.

01:27:32.220 --> 01:27:35.320
So somebody could fund their wow by playing Diablo

01:27:35.320 --> 01:27:36.180
and selling the items.

01:27:36.180 --> 01:27:39.500
But again, that's assuming there's a market for buyers.

01:27:39.500 --> 01:27:40.740
Does anyone out there in chat

01:27:40.740 --> 01:27:42.060
wanna say that they'll be using this

01:27:42.060 --> 01:27:44.300
to buy items to give them an advantage?

01:27:44.300 --> 01:27:46.860
Will you drop $3 to get an epic purple

01:27:46.860 --> 01:27:49.240
or whatever color they are in Diablo

01:27:49.240 --> 01:27:50.580
to give you an edge in the game?

01:27:50.580 --> 01:27:53.260
Or are you like, fuck that, I'll earn it?

01:27:53.260 --> 01:27:55.220
I bet you most people sitting in this room

01:27:55.220 --> 01:27:57.200
are probably like, fuck that, I'll earn it.

01:27:57.200 --> 01:27:58.040
I'm guessing.

01:27:58.040 --> 01:27:58.860
I know that's where I'm coming from.

01:27:58.860 --> 01:28:00.540
Fuck that, I'll cheat.

01:28:00.540 --> 01:28:02.500
You can't, you have to be online all the time.

01:28:02.500 --> 01:28:03.580
Oh, no, no, no, no.

01:28:03.580 --> 01:28:05.420
That's why you're mad, because you can't cheat.

01:28:05.420 --> 01:28:06.540
Oh, I'm not mad.

01:28:06.540 --> 01:28:08.580
I just think that it's a bold statement

01:28:08.580 --> 01:28:10.300
to say that you can't cheat.

01:28:10.300 --> 01:28:11.940
There is no can't, okay?

01:28:11.940 --> 01:28:12.980
It will happen.

01:28:12.980 --> 01:28:14.260
There will be a way.

01:28:16.420 --> 01:28:19.020
And then they'll be like, we ban you.

01:28:19.020 --> 01:28:23.300
You banned me from Diablo.

01:28:23.300 --> 01:28:25.420
RDG Singe in chat says,

01:28:25.420 --> 01:28:28.040
how about playing Diablo 3 for fun?

01:28:28.040 --> 01:28:30.260
Do people still do that?

01:28:30.260 --> 01:28:32.260
I hope so, that's my plan.

01:28:32.260 --> 01:28:35.040
I don't really want to play Diablo 3 with strangers either.

01:28:35.040 --> 01:28:37.940
I'll be playing co-op with friends, and that's it.

01:28:38.780 --> 01:28:40.740
Maybe, OLR people would count as friends

01:28:40.740 --> 01:28:42.300
if you wanted to play Diablo 3.

01:28:42.300 --> 01:28:44.700
We go on a co-op mission together.

01:28:44.700 --> 01:28:46.580
But I'm still looking forward to playing the game,

01:28:46.580 --> 01:28:49.660
and the online connection part doesn't really bother me

01:28:49.660 --> 01:28:52.060
so much, you kind of need it for StarCraft 2.

01:28:52.060 --> 01:28:54.980
I mean, I think technically you don't have to have one

01:28:54.980 --> 01:28:59.420
for StarCraft 2, but the game is much more rich with one,

01:28:59.420 --> 01:29:02.700
and seeing as Blizzard is very online centered

01:29:02.700 --> 01:29:03.740
with their achievements and everything now,

01:29:03.740 --> 01:29:06.060
this news doesn't really surprise me.

01:29:06.060 --> 01:29:07.220
I don't think Blizzard,

01:29:07.220 --> 01:29:09.020
Diablo isn't really something I'd want to try

01:29:09.020 --> 01:29:10.340
and play on the go anyway,

01:29:10.340 --> 01:29:13.080
or somewhere that I can't have an internet connection.

01:29:13.080 --> 01:29:16.180
You can have internet connections on planes now, you know?

01:29:16.180 --> 01:29:17.020
I don't know.

01:29:17.020 --> 01:29:17.840
But I get, I-

01:29:17.840 --> 01:29:19.740
Yeah, but not an internet connection to run that game.

01:29:19.740 --> 01:29:22.740
But I get, I am being a little bit of a hypocrite.

01:29:22.740 --> 01:29:23.580
I get it.

01:29:23.580 --> 01:29:24.780
I mean, I'm admit that,

01:29:24.780 --> 01:29:27.960
because I'm okay with what Blizzard's doing here,

01:29:27.960 --> 01:29:30.740
but yet I'm not okay with Ubisoft doing it with Driver.

01:29:30.740 --> 01:29:32.380
I think it's ridiculous.

01:29:32.380 --> 01:29:36.700
But, from what I understand, the single player of Driver

01:29:36.700 --> 01:29:38.740
doesn't have any online elements.

01:29:38.740 --> 01:29:40.660
The single player version of this game

01:29:40.660 --> 01:29:44.660
now does have a real money auction house involved,

01:29:44.660 --> 01:29:46.360
where people could be making money off of it.

01:29:46.360 --> 01:29:48.940
And I guess they've got to protect the environment.

01:29:48.940 --> 01:29:50.600
And heaven forbid somebody does cheat,

01:29:50.600 --> 01:29:52.260
and now this turns into like real money.

01:29:52.260 --> 01:29:54.900
That's when it's going to be a legal problem.

01:29:54.900 --> 01:29:58.540
Blizzard better hope that having everybody connected 24 seven

01:29:58.540 --> 01:30:00.020
really does keep out the cheaters.

01:30:00.020 --> 01:30:02.400
And they better really be watching that shit like a hawk.

01:30:02.400 --> 01:30:03.980
Because if somebody is able to exploit

01:30:03.980 --> 01:30:06.740
that real money system, it's over.

01:30:06.740 --> 01:30:07.840
You know what I mean?

01:30:09.060 --> 01:30:09.900
So.

01:30:11.300 --> 01:30:12.720
All right.

01:30:12.720 --> 01:30:14.660
Let's move on to news that came out about the next

01:30:14.660 --> 01:30:16.360
wow expansion.

01:30:16.360 --> 01:30:18.780
So, Dark Soccer, I know, right?

01:30:18.780 --> 01:30:21.060
You've been playing this for a while.

01:30:21.060 --> 01:30:21.900
The rumor.

01:30:23.520 --> 01:30:26.080
I laugh every time I think about it.

01:30:26.080 --> 01:30:28.600
The name apparently that has been registered

01:30:28.600 --> 01:30:31.300
for the next expansion, verified by MMO Trampion

01:30:31.300 --> 01:30:34.500
with trademarks and so forth, is Mists of Pandaria.

01:30:34.500 --> 01:30:36.060
Mop.

01:30:36.060 --> 01:30:37.980
Or the mop expansion.

01:30:37.980 --> 01:30:41.680
Pandarias, of course, are named for the pandaren.

01:30:41.680 --> 01:30:44.440
Living, breathing, walking, talking panda bears

01:30:44.440 --> 01:30:46.180
that made their way into wow culture

01:30:46.180 --> 01:30:49.540
as part of an April Fool's joke and never left.

01:30:49.540 --> 01:30:51.500
Yes, you can get the pandaren monk.

01:30:51.500 --> 01:30:53.560
That's one of the charity pets

01:30:53.560 --> 01:30:55.060
that actually they sold there.

01:30:56.020 --> 01:30:59.080
The trademark was apparently registered July 28th.

01:30:59.080 --> 01:31:02.020
And it could be that this is going to be out in time

01:31:02.020 --> 01:31:04.440
for Blizzcon, not the expansion itself,

01:31:04.440 --> 01:31:06.740
but more news on it will come out at Blizzcon.

01:31:08.220 --> 01:31:10.660
I guess that the rumors say pandarens

01:31:10.660 --> 01:31:12.700
will be a playable race,

01:31:12.700 --> 01:31:14.700
that you'll get to go to level 90, of course.

01:31:14.700 --> 01:31:16.860
A monk hero class.

01:31:16.860 --> 01:31:19.400
As you know, panda bears are all monks.

01:31:19.400 --> 01:31:22.100
Well, we had some discussion on this in guild chat

01:31:22.100 --> 01:31:23.120
not too long ago.

01:31:25.060 --> 01:31:27.740
In fact, I believe that I, it was,

01:31:27.740 --> 01:31:29.460
Miklotov was amongst the people

01:31:29.460 --> 01:31:31.900
because that's who I heard about it from.

01:31:31.900 --> 01:31:35.000
But we were talking about other possibilities

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:39.500
that it could be like the ruins of the pandaren empire,

01:31:39.500 --> 01:31:41.620
that perhaps there's only a few left

01:31:41.620 --> 01:31:44.260
and you learned to become a monk from one of them.

01:31:44.260 --> 01:31:46.020
Because we'd just gotten you races.

01:31:47.220 --> 01:31:50.300
So it could just be that you're exploring their culture

01:31:50.300 --> 01:31:53.420
like they're, who are the freaking walrus people again?

01:31:53.420 --> 01:31:54.240
Kaluak.

01:31:54.240 --> 01:31:56.460
Yeah, I like the walrus people.

01:31:56.460 --> 01:31:58.020
They're cool, they remind me of Wilford Brimley.

01:31:58.020 --> 01:31:59.420
Kuch Kuch.

01:31:59.420 --> 01:32:01.400
No, they all look like Wilford Brimley.

01:32:01.400 --> 01:32:02.240
Anyway.

01:32:03.800 --> 01:32:08.380
But I mean, it could be that you just get to visit

01:32:08.380 --> 01:32:10.420
the pandarens and you learn from them.

01:32:10.420 --> 01:32:12.700
So you get a monk class and maybe,

01:32:12.700 --> 01:32:15.200
like you were saying level 90,

01:32:15.200 --> 01:32:17.420
or, you know, we get more goody items.

01:32:17.420 --> 01:32:20.480
But I mean, I would personally like to, you know,

01:32:20.480 --> 01:32:24.600
have another reason to do five more levels worth of quests.

01:32:26.060 --> 01:32:27.900
My favorite theory about this though,

01:32:27.900 --> 01:32:30.620
is that this is just a Facebook or an IOS game.

01:32:30.620 --> 01:32:31.740
It's a spinoff game.

01:32:31.740 --> 01:32:33.820
God, I hope that's the case.

01:32:33.820 --> 01:32:35.740
That would be much more understandable.

01:32:35.740 --> 01:32:37.060
I don't know.

01:32:37.060 --> 01:32:39.180
I'm okay with the whole archeology idea.

01:32:39.180 --> 01:32:40.940
I call that the archeology concept,

01:32:40.940 --> 01:32:43.380
that you're trying to figure out why the pandarens got,

01:32:43.380 --> 01:32:44.980
you know, all murdered.

01:32:44.980 --> 01:32:46.900
I just don't want to see everybody playing

01:32:46.900 --> 01:32:48.060
a walking, talking panda bear,

01:32:48.060 --> 01:32:48.900
cause that's getting a little ridiculous.

01:32:48.900 --> 01:32:52.060
I really don't think that we're going to get them as a race,

01:32:52.060 --> 01:32:56.420
because I mean, it's like every fourth expansion

01:32:56.420 --> 01:32:59.580
or every even numbered expansion now has,

01:32:59.580 --> 01:33:02.380
I mean, two, there's only been four versions,

01:33:02.380 --> 01:33:04.580
has had a new race added.

01:33:04.580 --> 01:33:07.740
It was a new area.

01:33:07.740 --> 01:33:09.300
Each one's had a new area open.

01:33:09.300 --> 01:33:11.660
So I think that this one's just going to be a new area

01:33:11.660 --> 01:33:13.900
and a new, cause all right, let me look at it.

01:33:13.900 --> 01:33:14.740
Real quick.

01:33:14.740 --> 01:33:15.840
Miklotov's correcting me in chat.

01:33:15.840 --> 01:33:18.220
The walrus people are the Tuskar.

01:33:18.220 --> 01:33:20.660
I guess the Kaluak is the faction.

01:33:20.660 --> 01:33:21.780
My bad.

01:33:23.580 --> 01:33:25.740
Anyway, you know, we got the first one,

01:33:25.740 --> 01:33:28.080
introducing the world and everything,

01:33:28.080 --> 01:33:30.380
blah, blah, blah, boring.

01:33:30.380 --> 01:33:31.460
Cause it was.

01:33:31.460 --> 01:33:35.020
And then you get the burning crusades.

01:33:35.020 --> 01:33:37.660
You get two new races, one for each side.

01:33:37.660 --> 01:33:39.960
Demons, demons, and more demons.

01:33:41.860 --> 01:33:46.380
You get space goats and pretty blood elves.

01:33:46.380 --> 01:33:48.980
And you're fighting demons and fire.

01:33:49.920 --> 01:33:51.520
The, what was the burning Legion?

01:33:51.520 --> 01:33:52.860
And you have to learn to fly.

01:33:52.860 --> 01:33:53.700
Yeah.

01:33:53.700 --> 01:33:55.740
The burning Legion sounds like something you have to take

01:33:55.740 --> 01:33:57.420
antibiotics for.

01:33:57.420 --> 01:33:58.260
It's a salve.

01:33:59.260 --> 01:34:01.100
And then, okay, the next one you get basically,

01:34:01.100 --> 01:34:04.300
a new character class and a new area.

01:34:04.300 --> 01:34:06.720
So then when we get cataclysm,

01:34:06.720 --> 01:34:10.140
it was against two new races and a new area.

01:34:10.140 --> 01:34:11.500
And the whole world gets fucked up

01:34:11.500 --> 01:34:13.700
and the game gets made fun.

01:34:13.700 --> 01:34:16.660
So it would logically stand to reason

01:34:16.660 --> 01:34:18.460
that if they're establishing a pattern,

01:34:18.460 --> 01:34:22.220
then you'll be getting a new area and a new class.

01:34:22.220 --> 01:34:24.280
And it could possibly be, okay,

01:34:24.280 --> 01:34:26.940
what was the level cap for,

01:34:28.560 --> 01:34:29.400
for a,

01:34:29.400 --> 01:34:30.220
Wrath of the Lich King?

01:34:30.220 --> 01:34:31.060
80.

01:34:31.060 --> 01:34:31.880
Burning Crusade.

01:34:31.880 --> 01:34:32.720
70.

01:34:32.720 --> 01:34:33.560
70.

01:34:33.560 --> 01:34:34.980
You start off with a 55 character on,

01:34:34.980 --> 01:34:36.900
you know, with a level seven,

01:34:36.900 --> 01:34:39.220
coming from a level 70 cap.

01:34:39.220 --> 01:34:42.100
So given that the current cap right now is 85,

01:34:42.100 --> 01:34:44.980
I would think that maybe monks start off as a level 70

01:34:44.980 --> 01:34:45.820
or something like that.

01:34:45.820 --> 01:34:46.660
Perhaps.

01:34:46.660 --> 01:34:48.540
Actually, you know what else Wrath of the Lich King had?

01:34:48.540 --> 01:34:51.380
It had lots and lots and tons and tons of ice.

01:34:52.500 --> 01:34:54.300
Allow me to break the ice.

01:34:54.300 --> 01:34:55.260
Cold.

01:34:55.260 --> 01:34:56.100
Freeze.

01:34:56.100 --> 01:34:56.920
Cold.

01:34:56.920 --> 01:34:57.760
Freeze.

01:34:57.760 --> 01:34:58.600
Cold.

01:34:58.600 --> 01:34:59.700
Frozen ice.

01:34:59.700 --> 01:35:01.140
Cold.

01:35:01.140 --> 01:35:01.980
Killing winter.

01:35:01.980 --> 01:35:02.820
I say.

01:35:02.820 --> 01:35:03.660
It's actually the Lich King.

01:35:05.060 --> 01:35:06.100
Talking.

01:35:06.100 --> 01:35:07.420
Arthas, that bitch.

01:35:10.440 --> 01:35:12.380
I'm gonna draw that, you know.

01:35:12.380 --> 01:35:13.220
What?

01:35:13.220 --> 01:35:14.380
Okay, when I made my death knight,

01:35:14.380 --> 01:35:16.100
and I think you were there for that.

01:35:16.100 --> 01:35:17.220
When I finally made a death knight

01:35:17.220 --> 01:35:19.420
that was actually gonna play as a tank.

01:35:19.420 --> 01:35:21.220
I just was looking,

01:35:21.220 --> 01:35:22.500
cause I played a draw knight and you know,

01:35:22.500 --> 01:35:24.540
they're tall and skinny.

01:35:24.540 --> 01:35:25.580
Next to Arthas,

01:35:25.580 --> 01:35:28.100
who's just really big and stout.

01:35:28.100 --> 01:35:30.540
And I said, Arthas got to be a fat bitch.

01:35:31.660 --> 01:35:33.000
And I think it was,

01:35:34.820 --> 01:35:35.820
it was some,

01:35:35.820 --> 01:35:37.380
of course somebody in our guild said

01:35:37.380 --> 01:35:39.380
it was all those cookies.

01:35:39.380 --> 01:35:40.500
But Arthas likes cookies.

01:35:40.500 --> 01:35:43.380
So I was gonna draw a picture of Arthas

01:35:43.380 --> 01:35:46.700
lounged out like Jabba the Hutt eating cookies.

01:35:46.700 --> 01:35:49.340
Saying, let's kick some ice.

01:35:49.340 --> 01:35:50.900
I should do that.

01:35:50.900 --> 01:35:52.540
Anyway.

01:35:52.540 --> 01:35:54.420
So Pandaria,

01:35:54.420 --> 01:35:55.440
yay or nay?

01:35:55.440 --> 01:35:59.000
I'm all for something new.

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:00.080
I'm kinda, whatever.

01:36:00.080 --> 01:36:01.320
Blizzard's gonna do what they're gonna do

01:36:01.320 --> 01:36:02.480
and I can't really control it.

01:36:02.480 --> 01:36:04.480
But Firelands has been kinda,

01:36:04.480 --> 01:36:07.340
eh, burn, depressing.

01:36:07.340 --> 01:36:10.200
Look, they can send us to,

01:36:10.200 --> 01:36:11.440
you know,

01:36:11.440 --> 01:36:12.720
they can send us to play with.

01:36:12.720 --> 01:36:14.040
To the land of pee.

01:36:14.040 --> 01:36:15.800
We can go to Keyboard Cat,

01:36:15.800 --> 01:36:18.800
who lives in the land of pee, pee, pee, pee, pee.

01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:19.840
I don't really care.

01:36:19.840 --> 01:36:24.620
Like as long as it doesn't have that horribly steep curve

01:36:24.620 --> 01:36:27.280
into raiding and doing all that stuff that Cataclysm did,

01:36:27.280 --> 01:36:29.140
as long as it's more accessible,

01:36:29.140 --> 01:36:30.520
I think as long as it just plays more like

01:36:30.520 --> 01:36:33.040
Wrath of the Lich King, to be honest,

01:36:33.040 --> 01:36:34.540
I think it'll be fine.

01:36:34.540 --> 01:36:35.380
Well,

01:36:37.480 --> 01:36:39.720
now that I'm raiding, I really like it.

01:36:39.720 --> 01:36:41.760
I think that more people,

01:36:41.760 --> 01:36:43.360
it should definitely, there should be,

01:36:43.360 --> 01:36:46.240
maybe they'll incorporate easier raids.

01:36:46.240 --> 01:36:48.020
Like, beginning raids.

01:36:48.960 --> 01:36:50.100
Mikolatov in chat says,

01:36:50.100 --> 01:36:55.100
I don't get all the hate for this being a possible expansion.

01:37:20.740 --> 01:37:22.900
I just don't like them that much,

01:37:22.900 --> 01:37:25.340
or I need them in my Warcraft, you know?

01:37:25.340 --> 01:37:27.020
And maybe the Pandarens are actually

01:37:27.020 --> 01:37:29.100
a magical illusion of panda bears,

01:37:29.100 --> 01:37:32.100
and they really look like, not like space goats.

01:37:33.940 --> 01:37:36.320
For the record, space goats are the best.

01:37:36.320 --> 01:37:38.740
All right, enough wow talk.

01:37:38.740 --> 01:37:39.980
Space goat.

01:37:39.980 --> 01:37:41.780
I got another show for wow talk,

01:37:41.780 --> 01:37:42.780
and I think we've had plenty,

01:37:42.780 --> 01:37:45.400
but remember, where Blizzard goes,

01:37:45.400 --> 01:37:46.900
a lot of these PC games will follow,

01:37:46.900 --> 01:37:48.900
especially this whole persistent online connection.

01:37:48.900 --> 01:37:50.780
I think it's gonna be really interesting

01:37:50.780 --> 01:37:54.620
how people are gonna borderline forgive Blizzard, maybe.

01:37:54.620 --> 01:37:56.060
I think there's definitely some people

01:37:56.060 --> 01:37:57.780
hating Blizzard over this decision,

01:37:57.780 --> 01:38:00.020
but there's a lot more hating Ubisoft over theirs,

01:38:00.020 --> 01:38:02.160
so it's very interesting.

01:38:02.160 --> 01:38:03.580
Let's move on to the email bag, though.

01:38:03.580 --> 01:38:06.020
Mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com.

01:38:07.300 --> 01:38:09.020
Every week you email us,

01:38:09.020 --> 01:38:11.440
and we might read them here on air,

01:38:11.440 --> 01:38:15.060
if Dark Soccer is feeling saucy or burpy.

01:38:15.060 --> 01:38:17.060
Hey, I just have the mic up.

01:38:17.060 --> 01:38:19.460
She's going to read some emails for you right now.

01:38:19.460 --> 01:38:21.260
You better be nice to me, I gave you ice cream.

01:38:21.260 --> 01:38:22.940
You did give me ice cream, it was delicious.

01:38:22.940 --> 01:38:24.820
I found Samoa's ice cream.

01:38:24.820 --> 01:38:26.900
It was really fucking good, y'all.

01:38:26.900 --> 01:38:29.220
So the first email here,

01:38:29.220 --> 01:38:32.000
while looking at the disused televisions in the basement,

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:35.220
I was inspired to ask again, Jamie, that was to me,

01:38:35.220 --> 01:38:36.260
does the vault have a collection

01:38:36.260 --> 01:38:38.300
of older television sets as well?

01:38:38.300 --> 01:38:39.140
No.

01:38:40.460 --> 01:38:41.860
I'm sure someone has to make adapters

01:38:41.860 --> 01:38:44.960
to hook up Atari 2600 or Odyssey to HDMI,

01:38:44.960 --> 01:38:47.060
but do you prefer the original sets?

01:38:47.060 --> 01:38:50.180
The only way I can really play the Odyssey

01:38:50.180 --> 01:38:51.380
is to hook up to the original sets,

01:38:51.380 --> 01:38:54.540
but all of our other systems will work with the modern TVs.

01:38:55.540 --> 01:38:56.860
They make different adapters.

01:38:56.860 --> 01:38:59.700
You don't have to use the little prongs to make it work.

01:38:59.700 --> 01:39:02.660
I was gonna say, can't you get an RF adapter

01:39:02.660 --> 01:39:05.460
at Radio Shack that will change it to RCAs?

01:39:05.460 --> 01:39:07.040
Yeah, you can get an adapter.

01:39:07.040 --> 01:39:08.940
Just the one problem is that I think, actually,

01:39:08.940 --> 01:39:13.460
since the Odyssey was from, I wanna say, like,

01:39:13.460 --> 01:39:16.260
81 or something like that,

01:39:16.260 --> 01:39:20.460
it really, there's no way to make it work with a newer TV.

01:39:20.460 --> 01:39:22.380
Also, I think you might expose yourself

01:39:22.380 --> 01:39:25.540
to some shitty lag if you use the converters.

01:39:25.540 --> 01:39:27.740
I don't really do this in my house,

01:39:27.740 --> 01:39:28.580
so I couldn't tell you,

01:39:28.580 --> 01:39:31.260
but I think you do open yourself up to lag issues.

01:39:31.260 --> 01:39:32.600
I'll take some pictures in the vault,

01:39:32.600 --> 01:39:35.580
but we actually, right now, have a couple of TVs

01:39:35.580 --> 01:39:39.140
from just little small HD monitors that were

01:39:39.140 --> 01:39:44.140
obtained from the destruction of a video game chain

01:39:48.020 --> 01:39:49.640
that I won't talk about,

01:39:51.500 --> 01:39:56.500
that they were Xbox 360 demo units.

01:39:57.020 --> 01:39:58.860
We got monitors from them.

01:39:58.860 --> 01:39:59.860
So that's what we have hooked up

01:39:59.860 --> 01:40:01.000
with a couple of Switch boxes.

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:06.000
So we have about eight systems hooked up in the other room,

01:40:06.820 --> 01:40:08.780
eight or nine, something like that,

01:40:08.780 --> 01:40:10.280
hooked up to these TVs.

01:40:11.920 --> 01:40:14.180
I mean, really, to be honest,

01:40:14.180 --> 01:40:15.980
we have two games on the Odyssey

01:40:15.980 --> 01:40:18.260
that I really have an interest in playing,

01:40:18.260 --> 01:40:19.960
so we don't really bother hooking it up.

01:40:19.960 --> 01:40:21.020
And again, like I said,

01:40:21.020 --> 01:40:23.160
we don't have anything to hook it up to.

01:40:23.160 --> 01:40:24.660
All the other ones, no problem.

01:40:24.660 --> 01:40:26.100
We can hook them up to just about anything,

01:40:26.100 --> 01:40:28.300
although I really do think that,

01:40:28.300 --> 01:40:30.440
actually, I don't think that we've tried the Atari

01:40:30.440 --> 01:40:33.280
on an HDTV.

01:40:33.280 --> 01:40:36.100
I think that last time we played one of our Ataris,

01:40:36.100 --> 01:40:38.340
we actually did have a CRT.

01:40:38.340 --> 01:40:39.340
Oh, well.

01:40:39.340 --> 01:40:40.500
It's not like it's that hard

01:40:40.500 --> 01:40:43.460
to go find a CRT monitor anymore.

01:40:44.880 --> 01:40:46.500
I can go to the thrift store.

01:40:46.500 --> 01:40:48.380
Oh, look, a TV, rabbit ears.

01:40:49.540 --> 01:40:51.300
Also, I apologize for any confusion

01:40:51.300 --> 01:40:52.300
about last week's email

01:40:52.300 --> 01:40:54.600
regarding the voices of multiplayer games.

01:40:54.600 --> 01:40:56.980
My use of the term character was somewhat misleading.

01:40:56.980 --> 01:40:59.300
I meant specifically the volumes of online players

01:40:59.300 --> 01:41:01.020
speaking through their player characters,

01:41:01.020 --> 01:41:02.660
not those of the NPCs.

01:41:02.660 --> 01:41:03.860
Thanks again, Robert M.

01:41:05.840 --> 01:41:08.260
I think we did address that, though.

01:41:08.260 --> 01:41:11.440
I think we were leaning towards the NPC answer,

01:41:11.440 --> 01:41:14.100
but I thought I had brought up something

01:41:14.100 --> 01:41:17.300
that the characters did sound further away,

01:41:17.300 --> 01:41:20.320
but I can't remember, off the top of my head,

01:41:20.320 --> 01:41:21.940
what it was.

01:41:21.940 --> 01:41:23.540
Keep in mind, a lot of MMOs,

01:41:23.540 --> 01:41:27.200
you don't really do voice chat through the MMO itself,

01:41:27.200 --> 01:41:29.820
and those are actually kind of hard to find,

01:41:29.820 --> 01:41:30.980
the games where that happens,

01:41:30.980 --> 01:41:33.900
because yes, you have voice chat in WoW,

01:41:33.900 --> 01:41:35.020
but nobody uses it.

01:41:35.020 --> 01:41:37.380
I'm telling you, nobody uses it.

01:41:37.380 --> 01:41:38.940
I didn't even know it was there.

01:41:38.940 --> 01:41:41.340
And it's not in the public chat channels, anyway.

01:41:42.740 --> 01:41:44.340
Okay, ooh, we have one from Sil.

01:41:45.820 --> 01:41:46.660
Ready?

01:41:47.580 --> 01:41:48.420
Yes.

01:41:48.420 --> 01:41:49.700
Hi, guys, I hope all of you are doing well.

01:41:49.700 --> 01:41:50.700
A few days ago, I bought

01:41:50.700 --> 01:41:53.340
Vampire the Masquerade Bloodlines through Steam.

01:41:53.340 --> 01:41:55.060
Of course, it didn't want to work properly,

01:41:55.060 --> 01:41:58.580
and I had to download a patch through the Steam forums.

01:41:58.580 --> 01:42:00.660
In a way, I thought it would have been nice

01:42:00.660 --> 01:42:02.760
if Steam would just patch it themselves.

01:42:02.760 --> 01:42:04.540
Then again, I'm not that technical,

01:42:04.540 --> 01:42:06.220
and it might not be possible.

01:42:06.220 --> 01:42:07.740
Anyhow, I started to play this game,

01:42:07.740 --> 01:42:09.420
and even if it is an older game,

01:42:09.420 --> 01:42:10.900
I really love the story.

01:42:10.900 --> 01:42:12.680
The options where you can choose how to respond

01:42:12.680 --> 01:42:15.640
and that it actually has an effect on the story of the game

01:42:15.640 --> 01:42:17.380
is something that I really enjoy.

01:42:17.380 --> 01:42:18.720
It makes me want to replay the game

01:42:18.720 --> 01:42:21.340
and try different things just to see how the story changes.

01:42:21.340 --> 01:42:22.940
Perhaps I'm also just happy to see

01:42:22.940 --> 01:42:24.560
some proper blood-sucking vampires

01:42:24.560 --> 01:42:27.020
instead of the woo me and my curse and stare at you

01:42:27.020 --> 01:42:28.420
while you're sleeping glittery twats

01:42:28.420 --> 01:42:30.580
that seem to be ruling the media now.

01:42:30.580 --> 01:42:31.420
I love her.

01:42:31.420 --> 01:42:35.940
For the record, the email's titled non-sparkly vampires.

01:42:37.140 --> 01:42:39.700
Did you ever start playing a game

01:42:39.700 --> 01:42:42.040
thinking it would be okay, but nothing mind-blowing,

01:42:42.040 --> 01:42:44.380
but the more you played it, the more you loved it?

01:42:44.380 --> 01:42:45.440
Guardian legend?

01:42:46.460 --> 01:42:47.700
Because when you start playing that game,

01:42:47.700 --> 01:42:49.300
it's like, oh, I'm shooting shit.

01:42:49.300 --> 01:42:50.860
Whoa, there's an RPG!

01:42:52.820 --> 01:42:55.020
I get, restate the question for me real quick.

01:42:55.020 --> 01:42:56.900
Have you ever started a game

01:42:56.900 --> 01:42:59.600
thinking that it would be okay, but nothing mind-blowing,

01:42:59.600 --> 01:43:01.380
but the more you played it, the more you loved it?

01:43:01.380 --> 01:43:02.660
Ooh.

01:43:02.660 --> 01:43:04.040
Mr. Final Fantasy 13?

01:43:05.460 --> 01:43:07.660
But those games, I kinda already had the bar set high.

01:43:07.660 --> 01:43:08.740
I'm really trying to think of something

01:43:08.740 --> 01:43:10.460
kinda outside the norm.

01:43:10.460 --> 01:43:12.140
Let me think on that for a minute.

01:43:13.300 --> 01:43:16.020
I'm trying to think of any others.

01:43:17.560 --> 01:43:19.740
Actually, when I got back into WoW.

01:43:19.740 --> 01:43:21.560
Yeah, I gotta say, World of Warcraft

01:43:21.560 --> 01:43:23.380
actually kinda jumps out at me.

01:43:24.300 --> 01:43:25.300
When I first played WoW,

01:43:25.300 --> 01:43:26.660
I didn't think it was really all that,

01:43:26.660 --> 01:43:28.180
and I didn't think I was gonna get that into it,

01:43:28.180 --> 01:43:30.260
but when all my friends were playing,

01:43:30.260 --> 01:43:32.180
and it became a lot more of a chat room

01:43:32.180 --> 01:43:34.180
with fire spells and swords, so to speak,

01:43:34.180 --> 01:43:36.000
I think that was actually a game.

01:43:36.940 --> 01:43:38.620
Well, for me, when I started questing.

01:43:39.620 --> 01:43:42.400
I guess you could say VVVVV that I played this week.

01:43:42.400 --> 01:43:45.120
I didn't think I was gonna like it as much as I did.

01:43:46.140 --> 01:43:48.340
Well, I knew I was gonna like Portal 2,

01:43:48.340 --> 01:43:50.700
but I didn't know that I'd like it as much as I did.

01:43:50.700 --> 01:43:53.960
So, yeah, I mean, I'm sure there's a bunch of games,

01:43:53.960 --> 01:43:55.080
but I'm still loving this show,

01:43:55.080 --> 01:43:57.940
and I'm still waiting for my biscuits, Rob.

01:43:57.940 --> 01:43:58.900
I'll work on that.

01:43:58.900 --> 01:44:01.140
They're with the tea and crumpets.

01:44:01.140 --> 01:44:03.220
So, PS, if you're an MMO player,

01:44:03.220 --> 01:44:04.720
you'll love the attached image, I hope.

01:44:04.720 --> 01:44:05.860
Okay, let's have a look.

01:44:06.980 --> 01:44:09.420
The Nine Circles of MMO Hell.

01:44:09.420 --> 01:44:11.020
You know what, I'm actually gonna save this

01:44:11.020 --> 01:44:13.080
and post it on our...

01:44:13.080 --> 01:44:13.920
Tumblr.

01:44:13.920 --> 01:44:14.740
Tumblr.

01:44:14.740 --> 01:44:15.580
There you go.

01:44:15.580 --> 01:44:16.420
Okay, so let me just save.

01:44:16.420 --> 01:44:17.900
Orangelandsradio.tumblr.com.

01:44:17.900 --> 01:44:21.260
Image, I'll do MMO Hell.

01:44:21.260 --> 01:44:22.960
You could do it after the mailbag statement.

01:44:22.960 --> 01:44:24.100
I'm just saving the image,

01:44:24.100 --> 01:44:26.460
because I'm gonna close the email.

01:44:26.460 --> 01:44:29.280
So, bite my behind, Rob.

01:44:29.280 --> 01:44:30.420
You ready?

01:44:30.420 --> 01:44:31.940
Newsflash!

01:44:31.940 --> 01:44:34.340
The tester season three is casting, info below.

01:44:34.340 --> 01:44:36.700
I'll be watching, not auditioning, Rob-a-buh.

01:44:36.700 --> 01:44:38.420
Oh, yes, I heard about this on Twitter this week,

01:44:38.420 --> 01:44:39.920
and I sent it over to Lokey-O-L-R,

01:44:39.920 --> 01:44:41.020
and I was like, Lokey,

01:44:41.020 --> 01:44:42.620
weren't you saying something about

01:44:42.620 --> 01:44:44.900
you'd like to try a new career?

01:44:44.900 --> 01:44:46.760
Well, I will link it in the chat room,

01:44:46.760 --> 01:44:48.540
and if any of you make it on there,

01:44:48.540 --> 01:44:51.220
plug the crap out of us.

01:44:51.220 --> 01:44:53.100
Actually, I wanna say,

01:44:54.340 --> 01:44:56.220
they were saying that the prize for the winner

01:44:56.220 --> 01:44:58.940
this season isn't like a testing thing,

01:44:58.940 --> 01:45:01.980
it's like actually a role in production.

01:45:01.980 --> 01:45:03.580
So, they're kinda up in the ante

01:45:03.580 --> 01:45:05.100
on prize this year a little bit.

01:45:05.100 --> 01:45:06.940
Okay, Jamie's trying out.

01:45:06.940 --> 01:45:08.020
For real?

01:45:08.020 --> 01:45:08.860
Why not?

01:45:08.860 --> 01:45:09.680
Oh my God, you should.

01:45:09.680 --> 01:45:10.780
Oh my God.

01:45:10.780 --> 01:45:12.740
Sign up now, why not?

01:45:12.740 --> 01:45:14.220
Look into it, and see if the prize

01:45:14.220 --> 01:45:15.580
is something you'd actually want.

01:45:15.580 --> 01:45:17.020
Well, because if they can get me in

01:45:17.020 --> 01:45:20.200
as any level of art production.

01:45:20.200 --> 01:45:21.040
Yeah, I-

01:45:21.040 --> 01:45:22.020
That's just my career, right there.

01:45:22.020 --> 01:45:25.380
I believe the prize is like actual,

01:45:25.380 --> 01:45:27.460
on the production team this time.

01:45:27.460 --> 01:45:29.940
And it better not be pee-on,

01:45:29.940 --> 01:45:32.040
because I actually have some skills to offer.

01:45:32.040 --> 01:45:33.560
You know what, if you start as pee-on

01:45:33.560 --> 01:45:35.260
for like two months, you'll probably move up real quick.

01:45:35.260 --> 01:45:37.540
That guy who won the first season of the tester

01:45:37.540 --> 01:45:39.860
only tested for like a couple months,

01:45:39.860 --> 01:45:42.020
and now he does marketing stuff.

01:45:42.020 --> 01:45:43.380
So...

01:45:43.380 --> 01:45:44.900
Dude, wouldn't that be crazy?

01:45:46.900 --> 01:45:48.480
You know what, Dark Soccer, if you try out

01:45:48.480 --> 01:45:51.180
and you get your little thing online or whatever,

01:45:51.180 --> 01:45:52.740
I'll help you make your video.

01:45:52.740 --> 01:45:55.400
Okay.

01:45:55.400 --> 01:45:56.580
But you, wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:45:56.580 --> 01:45:58.180
You used to, wait, hold on, hold on,

01:45:58.180 --> 01:46:00.120
cause I just gotta, okay.

01:46:01.060 --> 01:46:02.820
If I'm not mistaking, Dark Soccer,

01:46:02.820 --> 01:46:05.260
you hate reality television,

01:46:05.260 --> 01:46:06.980
and for a long time on this program,

01:46:06.980 --> 01:46:09.780
you never wanted to be on video, correct?

01:46:09.780 --> 01:46:10.620
Yes.

01:46:10.620 --> 01:46:13.740
So you are now auditioning for a reality TV show.

01:46:13.740 --> 01:46:16.420
Am I understanding correctly?

01:46:16.420 --> 01:46:19.300
If a job comes out of it, me, who is currently jobless.

01:46:20.180 --> 01:46:22.420
Rob, you have no idea what I've been trying to do

01:46:22.420 --> 01:46:23.740
to get hired, okay?

01:46:25.060 --> 01:46:28.660
I just, it's kinda crazy, but I love it.

01:46:28.660 --> 01:46:29.620
I hope you get on.

01:46:29.620 --> 01:46:31.320
I actually watched the tester.

01:46:32.500 --> 01:46:33.860
Might I go so far as to say

01:46:33.860 --> 01:46:35.420
I enjoyed the last season of the tester.

01:46:35.420 --> 01:46:37.980
I think they could do a little more with it, but...

01:46:39.340 --> 01:46:41.780
You might also wanna watch the show.

01:46:41.780 --> 01:46:43.980
They give you an option for them not to share your shit.

01:46:43.980 --> 01:46:44.820
That's good.

01:46:44.820 --> 01:46:47.140
You have an idea what to expect, just saying.

01:46:47.140 --> 01:46:52.140
Oh, man.

01:46:52.780 --> 01:46:54.020
I can't wait.

01:46:54.020 --> 01:46:55.780
I hope Dark Soccer gets on the show.

01:46:55.780 --> 01:46:57.940
Of course, that means she won't be on OLR for a few weeks

01:46:57.940 --> 01:47:00.140
while they're taping the show.

01:47:00.140 --> 01:47:01.940
Party at Jamie's house.

01:47:01.940 --> 01:47:04.900
Well, yeah, but I'll be famous and you won't.

01:47:06.500 --> 01:47:07.700
Wow.

01:47:07.700 --> 01:47:09.300
You'll get booted off first.

01:47:09.300 --> 01:47:10.440
No, I won't.

01:47:12.060 --> 01:47:13.540
It doesn't like my password.

01:47:14.460 --> 01:47:15.820
All right, let's move on.

01:47:15.820 --> 01:47:16.640
Do we have any more emails

01:47:16.640 --> 01:47:17.480
or was it the last one?

01:47:17.480 --> 01:47:18.300
I'll ask you in a second.

01:47:18.300 --> 01:47:19.140
All right.

01:47:20.580 --> 01:47:22.100
I'm enhancing my celebrity.

01:47:22.100 --> 01:47:24.580
You have all week to try out for that stinking show.

01:47:24.580 --> 01:47:26.160
Okay.

01:47:26.160 --> 01:47:29.100
Hey, OLR, it's SonicM88 here.

01:47:29.100 --> 01:47:31.060
I've been intermittently listening to the podcast

01:47:31.060 --> 01:47:32.580
and live show for a few years,

01:47:32.580 --> 01:47:35.060
so you probably don't recognize the name.

01:47:35.060 --> 01:47:36.300
We don't recognize a lot of you people.

01:47:36.300 --> 01:47:37.740
I mean, hi.

01:47:37.740 --> 01:47:38.580
I'm kidding, kitty.

01:47:38.580 --> 01:47:40.100
I heard that name in chat earlier tonight, so welcome.

01:47:40.100 --> 01:47:41.900
Anyway, I picked up a 3DS this week

01:47:41.900 --> 01:47:43.160
so I can get the retro games

01:47:43.160 --> 01:47:45.640
and also the money back from the price drop.

01:47:45.640 --> 01:47:47.380
As Loki predicted, GameStop has decided

01:47:47.380 --> 01:47:49.360
not to honor the price guarantee thing,

01:47:49.360 --> 01:47:50.780
which does not surprise me at all.

01:47:50.780 --> 01:47:52.640
In fact, I'm not even sure I'll be able

01:47:52.640 --> 01:47:55.860
to get the AD back from where I purchased it.

01:47:55.860 --> 01:47:57.260
I bought it at Best Buy

01:47:57.260 --> 01:47:58.760
and they didn't know about the price drop

01:47:58.760 --> 01:48:01.060
or didn't say anything about not honoring their policy

01:48:01.060 --> 01:48:03.220
when I bought it, but I have this feeling

01:48:03.220 --> 01:48:04.060
that it won't work.

01:48:04.060 --> 01:48:06.360
Either way, in my mind, it's totally worth it

01:48:06.360 --> 01:48:08.560
just for the GBA titles alone.

01:48:08.560 --> 01:48:10.900
I really miss the Game Boy as a platform.

01:48:10.900 --> 01:48:13.580
I never really got into the DS like I did with the Game Boy

01:48:13.580 --> 01:48:16.420
and ended up selling the one I had three years ago.

01:48:16.420 --> 01:48:19.580
So I've been out of the DS world for three years.

01:48:19.580 --> 01:48:20.860
That's where you come in.

01:48:20.860 --> 01:48:24.460
I'd like to keep my DS for more than just retro GBA titles

01:48:24.460 --> 01:48:25.980
I bought it for, so I would like to hear

01:48:25.980 --> 01:48:28.980
some of your favorite DS games that might suit my interests.

01:48:28.980 --> 01:48:31.380
What do you recommend as games that appeal to everyone

01:48:31.380 --> 01:48:34.140
and what specific titles would interest someone like me?

01:48:34.140 --> 01:48:35.860
I'm not a fan of RPGs anymore.

01:48:35.860 --> 01:48:37.140
Oh, hang up, no, I'm kidding.

01:48:37.140 --> 01:48:39.180
Since I don't have the time to play them,

01:48:39.180 --> 01:48:41.400
I'm more into shooters, arcade games, and platformers.

01:48:41.400 --> 01:48:42.740
I plan on getting Geometry Wars,

01:48:42.740 --> 01:48:44.300
Galaxies, a Castlevania title.

01:48:44.300 --> 01:48:45.340
Which one is best?

01:48:45.340 --> 01:48:46.460
Oh, what was that one?

01:48:46.460 --> 01:48:48.180
Order of Ecclesia was really good.

01:48:50.100 --> 01:48:51.820
Retro Game Challenge, Wire Your Wear Touch,

01:48:51.820 --> 01:48:53.140
Trauma Center 2.

01:48:53.140 --> 01:48:54.900
I picked a book arena of time, obviously,

01:48:54.900 --> 01:48:57.260
and Plants vs. Zombies download version so far.

01:48:57.260 --> 01:48:59.340
Oh, and Mario Kart DS is my favorite DS game

01:48:59.340 --> 01:49:00.860
from when I owned one before.

01:49:01.980 --> 01:49:04.920
I got Puyo Pop, I mean Puyo Puyo.

01:49:04.920 --> 01:49:07.220
I've got Otsutatakayo Endan,

01:49:07.220 --> 01:49:08.500
or you could get Elite Beat Agents.

01:49:08.500 --> 01:49:10.540
I actually really prefer the Japanese one.

01:49:10.540 --> 01:49:13.500
Um, what else is in my thing?

01:49:13.500 --> 01:49:17.300
Oh yeah, what was that Professor Hatsworth game?

01:49:17.300 --> 01:49:18.320
Professor Layton?

01:49:18.320 --> 01:49:19.800
No, it was Hatsworth.

01:49:21.280 --> 01:49:23.340
It's like a combination puzzle game

01:49:23.340 --> 01:49:25.740
and investigation game.

01:49:25.740 --> 01:49:26.780
It's really interesting.

01:49:26.780 --> 01:49:28.220
Yeah, I kinda know what you're talking about, yeah.

01:49:28.220 --> 01:49:30.300
That game was pretty fun.

01:49:30.300 --> 01:49:32.140
I don't know, what else, Rob?

01:49:32.140 --> 01:49:33.420
He named a lot of them.

01:49:33.420 --> 01:49:36.120
I mean, gosh, you got a whole full plate there.

01:49:36.120 --> 01:49:37.580
Retro Game Challenge was one of the ones

01:49:37.580 --> 01:49:38.820
that came to my mind too.

01:49:38.820 --> 01:49:43.820
Um, oh, really good games on DS.

01:49:46.040 --> 01:49:47.740
I need more time to think.

01:49:47.740 --> 01:49:49.460
Actually, I should just go grab my DS case

01:49:49.460 --> 01:49:50.300
and see what's in it.

01:49:50.300 --> 01:49:51.140
I know, right?

01:49:51.140 --> 01:49:52.460
Like, I'm like, I can't see my DS collection

01:49:52.460 --> 01:49:53.460
right in front of me.

01:49:55.020 --> 01:49:56.940
A lot of people are really into the Pokemon games.

01:49:56.940 --> 01:49:58.380
I play a lot of Cookie Mama.

01:49:59.420 --> 01:50:01.580
Since he's talking about Trauma Center,

01:50:01.580 --> 01:50:03.900
Cookie Mama's like that with food.

01:50:03.900 --> 01:50:07.300
So it's really fun, and don't worry, Mama will fix it.

01:50:07.300 --> 01:50:09.260
I liked the game, the Kirby game,

01:50:09.260 --> 01:50:10.940
where you draw the lines.

01:50:10.940 --> 01:50:12.120
Oh, um.

01:50:13.140 --> 01:50:13.980
Kirby's.

01:50:13.980 --> 01:50:14.820
Epic Yarn.

01:50:14.820 --> 01:50:16.440
No, no, that was the Wii game.

01:50:17.500 --> 01:50:18.680
It was a different Kirby game

01:50:18.680 --> 01:50:20.420
where you would draw all the lines and stuff.

01:50:20.420 --> 01:50:22.200
I don't remember.

01:50:22.200 --> 01:50:23.660
Making me think.

01:50:23.660 --> 01:50:25.140
Am I a talk show host?

01:50:26.340 --> 01:50:28.700
Some of the old school, like even the Mario 64 port's

01:50:28.700 --> 01:50:30.220
actually really good too.

01:50:30.220 --> 01:50:32.620
Oh, Elite Beat Agents, says Dungeon Busters and Chat.

01:50:32.620 --> 01:50:34.540
Well, I said that, it says it Oendon,

01:50:34.540 --> 01:50:36.500
but I said you can get it as Elite Beat Agents,

01:50:36.500 --> 01:50:37.740
although I prefer Oendon.

01:50:41.140 --> 01:50:42.900
Oh, there's Ragnarok.

01:50:42.900 --> 01:50:44.660
And that's RPG though.

01:50:44.660 --> 01:50:46.180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:50:46.180 --> 01:50:47.020
I liked it though.

01:50:47.020 --> 01:50:48.620
Break Man says Civilization Revolution.

01:50:48.620 --> 01:50:49.960
I really liked that game.

01:50:49.960 --> 01:50:52.460
But I liked it on the consoles.

01:50:52.460 --> 01:50:53.300
I don't know how well it pointed over to DS.

01:50:53.300 --> 01:50:55.660
I should get my DS case and look.

01:50:55.660 --> 01:50:58.380
Then again, I've got like a box of games, so.

01:50:59.300 --> 01:51:01.980
I'll lend you one, maybe.

01:51:01.980 --> 01:51:04.040
I'll sell you some of them.

01:51:04.040 --> 01:51:05.100
I might not be listening live

01:51:05.100 --> 01:51:06.340
because of work early in the morning.

01:51:06.340 --> 01:51:07.260
I'm on the East Coast.

01:51:07.260 --> 01:51:09.340
So if the chat has any good recommendations too,

01:51:09.340 --> 01:51:10.860
I would love to hear those in the podcast,

01:51:10.860 --> 01:51:12.100
which we just did.

01:51:12.100 --> 01:51:13.860
Oh, he said he's not into RPGs,

01:51:13.860 --> 01:51:17.100
but the Final Fantasy IV remake is so fucking good.

01:51:17.100 --> 01:51:19.120
Like, you might want to think about

01:51:19.120 --> 01:51:20.560
going back to RPGs for that.

01:51:22.080 --> 01:51:23.660
Keep up the great work with the podcast.

01:51:23.660 --> 01:51:25.420
It's still my favorite out there by a long shot.

01:51:25.420 --> 01:51:26.740
Thanks guys, SonicM88.

01:51:26.740 --> 01:51:29.220
Oh, and by the way, I am playing Final Fantasy III,

01:51:29.220 --> 01:51:31.540
and it's pretty good on the game.

01:51:31.540 --> 01:51:32.500
See, there you go.

01:51:34.340 --> 01:51:35.300
Oh, great.

01:51:35.300 --> 01:51:38.300
My profile's made.

01:51:38.300 --> 01:51:39.700
Oh, I love what Zethur says here.

01:51:39.700 --> 01:51:41.760
Meteos is awesome.

01:51:41.760 --> 01:51:43.220
Meteos was an amazing DS game.

01:51:43.220 --> 01:51:44.640
Electroplankton was kind of fun.

01:51:44.640 --> 01:51:46.200
That was a great DS game.

01:51:47.480 --> 01:51:48.860
All right, is that it for emails?

01:51:48.860 --> 01:51:51.020
Yeah, and by the way, I've got a profile now.

01:51:51.020 --> 01:51:53.780
Mailbag at Orangeloungeradio.com.

01:51:53.780 --> 01:51:55.680
I ain't got a picture, but I'll link it in the chat room.

01:51:55.680 --> 01:51:56.860
Are you gonna, you should put a picture.

01:51:56.860 --> 01:51:58.060
You need to start filling it out

01:51:58.060 --> 01:52:00.220
with why you need to be on the tester.

01:52:00.220 --> 01:52:01.300
I will, but I'm linking it already.

01:52:01.300 --> 01:52:02.420
I need a job.

01:52:02.420 --> 01:52:06.260
You have to talk about how much you love Sony

01:52:06.260 --> 01:52:09.020
and how you've been a gaming girl all your life

01:52:09.020 --> 01:52:10.140
and dah, dah, dah.

01:52:10.140 --> 01:52:11.940
I bet you'll get on.

01:52:11.940 --> 01:52:12.800
I bet you will.

01:52:14.980 --> 01:52:16.820
All right, anyhow, moving on.

01:52:16.820 --> 01:52:18.300
We got some more news stories for you guys.

01:52:18.300 --> 01:52:19.700
Oh, we got the FUs of the Week.

01:52:19.700 --> 01:52:20.640
We gotta do those.

01:52:20.640 --> 01:52:25.640
As much fun as I would like to join the tester,

01:52:25.640 --> 01:52:29.980
I would hate to have to move to LA to be a game tester.

01:52:29.980 --> 01:52:31.820
Yeah, you do know you have to move to Santa Monica

01:52:31.820 --> 01:52:34.580
to be a game, to do the production, right?

01:52:34.580 --> 01:52:35.420
She doesn't care.

01:52:35.420 --> 01:52:36.260
I don't care.

01:52:36.260 --> 01:52:37.080
All right.

01:52:37.080 --> 01:52:37.920
I'll commute.

01:52:37.920 --> 01:52:38.760
She'll be closer to Disneyland.

01:52:38.760 --> 01:52:40.780
We'll be closer to Disneyland.

01:52:40.780 --> 01:52:42.220
But see, the problem is though,

01:52:42.220 --> 01:52:45.460
it's a judging panel that decides whether,

01:52:45.460 --> 01:52:46.440
or is it challenges?

01:52:46.440 --> 01:52:47.280
I don't know.

01:52:47.280 --> 01:52:48.740
I've never watched a show.

01:52:48.740 --> 01:52:51.580
It's weird challenges that sometimes have nothing

01:52:51.580 --> 01:52:52.420
to do with games.

01:52:52.420 --> 01:52:53.820
Yeah, it's like we challenge you to like,

01:52:53.820 --> 01:52:56.660
it's not like, see, cause when I first heard

01:52:56.660 --> 01:52:58.740
about the tester, I was thinking it's that

01:52:58.740 --> 01:53:03.740
there was a show that was on like sci-fi or spike

01:53:04.420 --> 01:53:05.260
or something like that.

01:53:05.260 --> 01:53:07.600
It was where they were actually playing games

01:53:07.600 --> 01:53:10.940
and they had game related challenges and stuff like that.

01:53:10.940 --> 01:53:14.860
But this is something stupid.

01:53:14.860 --> 01:53:15.880
Okay, here's what I said.

01:53:15.880 --> 01:53:16.720
I'd be an asshole.

01:53:16.720 --> 01:53:18.900
I own more than 40 different video game systems

01:53:18.900 --> 01:53:20.300
and have decades of experience.

01:53:20.300 --> 01:53:22.460
I'm also a graphic designer with a focus on video games

01:53:22.460 --> 01:53:24.420
and an experience in 3D design in Maya.

01:53:24.420 --> 01:53:25.480
I could use a job.

01:53:25.480 --> 01:53:29.480
How's that sound?

01:53:29.480 --> 01:53:31.680
You should give a shout out to the podcast too.

01:53:31.680 --> 01:53:32.680
Just for when you,

01:53:35.920 --> 01:53:36.920
just for, you know.

01:53:39.280 --> 01:53:42.620
When I am on, I'll do it in my video.

01:53:43.800 --> 01:53:45.300
Oh my God, I gotta do a video.

01:53:46.520 --> 01:53:47.640
I better be super cute.

01:53:47.640 --> 01:53:49.040
Better get your hair did.

01:53:49.040 --> 01:53:51.640
I need to get my hair did, my nails did.

01:53:51.640 --> 01:53:53.880
They're still naming DS games in the chat.

01:53:53.880 --> 01:53:55.600
Zether says Contra 4.

01:53:55.600 --> 01:53:56.440
That was pretty good.

01:53:56.440 --> 01:53:57.600
That was pretty good.

01:53:57.600 --> 01:53:59.060
Break Man in chat says,

01:53:59.060 --> 01:54:00.400
Loki couldn't do the tester

01:54:00.400 --> 01:54:02.080
because Loki doesn't take orders.

01:54:02.080 --> 01:54:03.560
Loki gives orders.

01:54:03.560 --> 01:54:04.400
Mwahaha.

01:54:05.440 --> 01:54:06.280
There you go.

01:54:06.280 --> 01:54:08.760
What are you, what are you looking at there?

01:54:08.760 --> 01:54:10.640
Are you like doing a tiny tower cheat?

01:54:10.640 --> 01:54:11.880
Is that what's happening?

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:16.240
Did you cheat and you have 6 million gold in tiny tower

01:54:16.240 --> 01:54:17.080
you damn cheater?

01:54:17.080 --> 01:54:18.120
What the crap?

01:54:18.120 --> 01:54:18.960
I am a cheater.

01:54:18.960 --> 01:54:20.240
You are a damn dirty cheater.

01:54:20.240 --> 01:54:21.080
How did you do it?

01:54:21.080 --> 01:54:21.900
No, I'm not cheating.

01:54:21.900 --> 01:54:22.740
I don't wanna know.

01:54:22.740 --> 01:54:23.580
I have a jailbroken device.

01:54:23.580 --> 01:54:25.080
I can do whatever the fuck I want.

01:54:25.080 --> 01:54:27.880
And it's completely legal.

01:54:27.880 --> 01:54:31.100
You're a lying, cheating sack of shit.

01:54:31.100 --> 01:54:31.940
That's why.

01:54:31.940 --> 01:54:33.000
My tiny tower ain't gonna be tiny no more.

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.920
That's why you're not gonna be a fucking game tester.

01:54:37.500 --> 01:54:39.000
Cause you can't play by the rules.

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:39.840
Bullshit.

01:54:39.840 --> 01:54:40.840
I could be an awesome tester.

01:54:40.840 --> 01:54:41.680
You know what?

01:54:41.680 --> 01:54:43.240
In fact, there was a thing that I saw.

01:54:43.240 --> 01:54:44.880
My picture and it's cute.

01:54:44.880 --> 01:54:45.720
Listen, there you go.

01:54:45.720 --> 01:54:47.360
There's a, I mean, shit.

01:54:47.360 --> 01:54:49.960
I've played so much Grand Theft Auto.

01:54:49.960 --> 01:54:51.120
I could easily be a tester

01:54:51.120 --> 01:54:52.880
for their goddamn multiplayer stuff.

01:54:52.880 --> 01:54:54.520
I know the ins and outs of all

01:54:54.520 --> 01:54:57.440
of their Grand Theft Auto games, including the PSP.

01:54:57.440 --> 01:55:00.360
I know shit that they probably don't even know.

01:55:00.360 --> 01:55:02.120
But then again, I don't want to compete

01:55:02.120 --> 01:55:04.400
on a show where I have to compare images

01:55:04.400 --> 01:55:05.760
to see what's different.

01:55:05.760 --> 01:55:08.080
If I wanted to do that, I'd buy a DS.

01:55:11.800 --> 01:55:12.680
All right.

01:55:12.680 --> 01:55:15.040
Break Man says, when you apply for the job, Dark Soccer,

01:55:15.040 --> 01:55:17.080
just tell them you know the Bobby Black Wolf.

01:55:17.080 --> 01:55:18.260
You'll be hired on right away.

01:55:18.260 --> 01:55:19.100
That's true.

01:55:19.100 --> 01:55:21.560
After all, he is a trending topic in Sacramento this evening.

01:55:21.560 --> 01:55:24.520
Yep.

01:55:24.520 --> 01:55:25.280
All right.

01:55:25.280 --> 01:55:26.800
Let's get to the FUs of the week.

01:55:43.280 --> 01:55:48.880
My FU of the week goes to me not having a copy of Black Matrix.

01:55:48.880 --> 01:55:50.040
I found it on eBay.

01:55:50.040 --> 01:55:51.240
No one will buy it for me.

01:55:51.240 --> 01:55:53.480
Boo hoo.

01:55:53.480 --> 01:55:56.840
My FU of the week goes to Loki for cheating on a tiny tower.

01:55:56.840 --> 01:56:02.720
And I hope his tower, because it's so cheaply made,

01:56:02.720 --> 01:56:05.320
I hope that the material that his tiny tower was made out

01:56:05.320 --> 01:56:06.880
of just collapses on itself.

01:56:06.880 --> 01:56:09.040
And the whole building just implodes on itself.

01:56:09.040 --> 01:56:11.000
He'll have the blood of his bitizens on his hands.

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:11.640
Exactly.

01:56:11.640 --> 01:56:15.320
And you'll have the blood of all those bitizens on your hands.

01:56:15.320 --> 01:56:18.160
Otherwise, I give an FU to tacos for being so delicious

01:56:18.160 --> 01:56:20.120
and making me fat.

01:56:20.120 --> 01:56:22.400
Loki.

01:56:22.400 --> 01:56:26.520
I guess my FU would go to the tester.

01:56:26.520 --> 01:56:32.080
Because if I were to win the tester,

01:56:32.080 --> 01:56:33.760
I'd end up working at Sony.

01:56:33.760 --> 01:56:37.320
And I'd look at the sheet of things that they want me to test.

01:56:37.320 --> 01:56:37.880
I'm sorry.

01:56:37.880 --> 01:56:39.600
I don't see that this, you know, I'm

01:56:39.600 --> 01:56:43.480
supposed to test to see if this game doesn't suck.

01:56:43.480 --> 01:56:44.360
I don't know.

01:56:44.360 --> 01:56:45.200
I got nothing.

01:56:45.200 --> 01:56:48.280
I'm not really mad at anything.

01:56:48.280 --> 01:56:53.240
It was surprisingly easy to do with the jailbroken device,

01:56:53.240 --> 01:56:55.400
I might add.

01:56:55.400 --> 01:56:57.720
Download a file, copy it over, done.

01:56:57.720 --> 01:56:59.280
And it didn't even erase my progress.

01:56:59.280 --> 01:57:01.120
It just added 6 million money.

01:57:01.120 --> 01:57:04.840
All right, so I see that DarkSakura has a profile.

01:57:04.840 --> 01:57:05.960
Like, how do I vote for you?

01:57:05.960 --> 01:57:08.200
Oh, there's a big clock in the corner.

01:57:08.200 --> 01:57:10.360
Voting begins in 16 days.

01:57:10.360 --> 01:57:14.360
Like, I can't actually vote for you yet, I guess.

01:57:14.360 --> 01:57:16.400
Like, I would make a profile and endorse you.

01:57:16.400 --> 01:57:19.240
But then doesn't that put me in the pool to try out for the show?

01:57:19.240 --> 01:57:19.960
No.

01:57:19.960 --> 01:57:21.720
You pick whether you're going to be a voter

01:57:21.720 --> 01:57:22.520
or you're going to be a candidate.

01:57:22.520 --> 01:57:23.040
Oh, OK.

01:57:23.040 --> 01:57:24.280
OK, then I'll sign up later.

01:57:24.280 --> 01:57:25.560
And I'll vote for you.

01:57:25.560 --> 01:57:28.320
But can I get the URL out to everybody so they can vote for you?

01:57:28.320 --> 01:57:30.160
I linked it in the chat room, so go for it.

01:57:30.160 --> 01:57:35.600
H-T-T-P-S, secure website, colon slash slash casting dot

01:57:35.600 --> 01:57:39.840
the tester dot com slash DarkSakura.

01:57:39.840 --> 01:57:40.440
There you go.

01:57:40.440 --> 01:57:42.940
I've added a second picture of what my hair looks like curly.

01:57:42.940 --> 01:57:45.440
You know, it just occurred to me.

01:57:45.440 --> 01:57:48.640
Derek H., I think on Dead Pixel Live last year,

01:57:48.640 --> 01:57:51.960
had the casting dude for the tester on his show.

01:57:51.960 --> 01:57:55.200
You need to talk to Derek and get dude's email address

01:57:55.200 --> 01:57:57.360
and just be like, yo, cast me.

01:57:57.360 --> 01:57:58.520
That's what you need to do.

01:57:58.520 --> 01:58:01.760
You need to just bypass this whole system right here.

01:58:01.760 --> 01:58:07.360
You need to go directly to show, do not pass go.

01:58:07.360 --> 01:58:08.920
We should all be on the tester.

01:58:08.920 --> 01:58:10.200
No, we're not all going on.

01:58:10.200 --> 01:58:11.920
I'm not going on that goddamn show.

01:58:11.920 --> 01:58:13.320
Come on, it'd be hilarious.

01:58:13.320 --> 01:58:15.480
If I go on the show, it is to be a judge,

01:58:15.480 --> 01:58:17.760
because I would enjoy nothing more than the judge, the two

01:58:17.760 --> 01:58:20.120
of you sitting up there getting ready for elimination.

01:58:20.120 --> 01:58:23.600
I think that guy doesn't know shit about testing games.

01:58:23.600 --> 01:58:27.800
He wasn't even a trending topic in Sacramento.

01:58:27.800 --> 01:58:30.440
Well, Loki, you're a goddamn cheater at all your video games.

01:58:30.440 --> 01:58:32.080
Explain why you should be on the tester.

01:58:32.080 --> 01:58:35.320
Because I know where to find the information

01:58:35.320 --> 01:58:36.320
that you're looking for.

01:58:36.320 --> 01:58:40.640
I know to find all the exploits and back doors for your games

01:58:40.640 --> 01:58:42.680
and how to get around this stuff.

01:58:42.680 --> 01:58:45.600
If you don't fix this shit, other people are going to do it.

01:58:45.600 --> 01:58:47.800
DarkSakura, your Kinect is still in a box.

01:58:47.800 --> 01:58:50.000
Why should you be the tester?

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:51.680
Because my Kinect's in the box.

01:58:51.680 --> 01:58:54.080
My move is fucking on the TV.

01:58:54.080 --> 01:58:58.160
That is why I need to be a fucking tester.

01:58:58.160 --> 01:59:00.560
Because we have a goddamn Gran Turismo setup

01:59:00.560 --> 01:59:04.160
built in our house, where we can play in a fucking race car.

01:59:04.160 --> 01:59:05.400
Is your name DarkSakura?

01:59:05.400 --> 01:59:06.000
That's funny.

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:07.840
You don't sound like DarkSakura.

01:59:07.840 --> 01:59:10.840
I can say, well, because we have a $400 rig set up

01:59:10.840 --> 01:59:17.280
to play Gran Turismo 5, and that we've built seats

01:59:17.280 --> 01:59:21.280
to play this set up out of the seats from a Honda Prelude,

01:59:21.280 --> 01:59:22.760
two of them.

01:59:22.760 --> 01:59:25.880
I have every Sony system ever made.

01:59:25.880 --> 01:59:27.920
OK, here.

01:59:27.920 --> 01:59:30.040
This is fine radio and all, but there's

01:59:30.040 --> 01:59:32.560
a part of me that is legit worried you're actually

01:59:32.560 --> 01:59:34.720
going to get on this show.

01:59:34.720 --> 01:59:36.160
I have legitimate concerns.

01:59:36.160 --> 01:59:38.520
If I get a job out of this, fuck yeah.

01:59:38.520 --> 01:59:40.920
But this could also end up very bad.

01:59:40.920 --> 01:59:42.920
You could end up being the bitch.

01:59:42.920 --> 01:59:47.200
I've seen you go without eating for some time.

01:59:47.200 --> 01:59:49.640
It is not going to be pretty if you have to do something.

01:59:49.640 --> 01:59:51.280
Yes, Rob knows what low blood sugar Jamie is like.

01:59:51.280 --> 01:59:52.680
And you might have to do something

01:59:52.680 --> 01:59:54.240
that you don't like on this program.

01:59:54.240 --> 01:59:55.200
And I am very worried.

01:59:55.200 --> 01:59:56.080
I should sign up too.

01:59:56.080 --> 01:59:57.200
You'll be hilarious.

01:59:57.200 --> 01:59:57.760
Like what?

01:59:57.760 --> 02:00:00.320
Play Imagine Babies?

02:00:00.320 --> 02:00:03.680
OK, one last season they had some fucking challenge

02:00:03.680 --> 02:00:05.640
where they were out there doing army stuff.

02:00:05.640 --> 02:00:06.960
And OK, I know.

02:00:06.960 --> 02:00:08.400
I know it'll piss you off.

02:00:08.400 --> 02:00:11.920
Working together as a team with people who are idiots.

02:00:11.920 --> 02:00:14.040
That is going to piss you off beyond belief.

02:00:14.040 --> 02:00:15.640
See, you're already fretting.

02:00:15.640 --> 02:00:17.360
No, I will tell you this.

02:00:17.360 --> 02:00:22.160
Because I worked with idiots at my job and I hit it very well.

02:00:22.160 --> 02:00:26.160
I know how to be a team fucking player.

02:00:26.160 --> 02:00:27.160
I am good.

02:00:27.160 --> 02:00:29.680
Can you teach Loki a thing or two?

02:00:29.680 --> 02:00:30.200
No.

02:00:30.200 --> 02:00:32.160
I am my own team.

02:00:32.160 --> 02:00:35.760
No, because his team is the voices in his head.

02:00:35.760 --> 02:00:41.440
I can take a picture of the vault and show it to them.

02:00:41.440 --> 02:00:43.560
This is why you need to have me because I've

02:00:43.560 --> 02:00:44.400
played all this shit.

02:00:44.400 --> 02:00:46.520
Legitimate concern that you actually

02:00:46.520 --> 02:00:48.760
may make a case for yourself to be on this show

02:00:48.760 --> 02:00:51.040
and you will actually be on this program.

02:00:51.040 --> 02:00:52.240
Look at this face.

02:00:52.240 --> 02:00:53.440
Look at this adorable face.

02:00:53.440 --> 02:00:54.840
I try not to.

02:00:54.840 --> 02:00:55.520
Shut up.

02:00:55.520 --> 02:00:56.520
I gave you ice cream.

02:00:56.520 --> 02:00:57.680
Look at me.

02:00:57.680 --> 02:00:58.240
I'm looking.

02:00:58.240 --> 02:00:59.440
I'm looking.

02:00:59.440 --> 02:01:01.160
I'm serious.

02:01:01.160 --> 02:01:02.480
I am for real serious.

02:01:02.480 --> 02:01:04.720
I want to be on the tester.

02:01:04.720 --> 02:01:06.560
You do realize this is for a minimum wage

02:01:06.560 --> 02:01:08.200
job in Santa Monica, right?

02:01:08.200 --> 02:01:09.280
It could be.

02:01:09.280 --> 02:01:12.320
But note that the Annie's up this season.

02:01:12.320 --> 02:01:14.040
It's a production job this year.

02:01:14.040 --> 02:01:15.200
Which means that I would be.

02:01:15.200 --> 02:01:16.000
A production job.

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:16.840
So what's that mean?

02:01:16.840 --> 02:01:17.840
I'll put it this way.

02:01:17.840 --> 02:01:21.600
Production is like, OK, like for a graphic designer,

02:01:21.600 --> 02:01:27.320
production would be like color editing, color correction,

02:01:27.320 --> 02:01:30.480
you know, adjusting textures, that type of thing.

02:01:30.480 --> 02:01:31.920
Here's a bunch of spindles of disks.

02:01:31.920 --> 02:01:32.920
Here's a bunch of cases.

02:01:32.920 --> 02:01:35.240
We need you to produce the finished product.

02:01:35.240 --> 02:01:37.280
No, that's not how it works.

02:01:37.280 --> 02:01:40.480
Anyone that's in production is in like the actual building

02:01:40.480 --> 02:01:42.400
part of the game, like you may be crunching numbers

02:01:42.400 --> 02:01:43.960
or doing some data entry.

02:01:43.960 --> 02:01:45.920
You know, it would be something that's

02:01:45.920 --> 02:01:49.080
the equivalent of the job that I was just fucking doing.

02:01:49.080 --> 02:01:51.440
Except I actually have skills to bring to the table.

02:01:51.440 --> 02:01:53.760
They could put me to work in art production.

02:01:53.760 --> 02:01:54.520
And guess what?

02:01:54.520 --> 02:01:55.560
I would be good at it.

02:01:55.560 --> 02:01:58.840
Because that's what I'm trying to do with my life.

02:01:58.840 --> 02:02:00.320
You know what?

02:02:00.320 --> 02:02:01.560
If I sign up for the tester.

02:02:01.560 --> 02:02:02.160
What?

02:02:02.160 --> 02:02:05.200
I'm going to do it in my costume.

02:02:05.200 --> 02:02:07.600
Why are you people trying out for the tester?

02:02:07.600 --> 02:02:09.560
You used to make fun of this show two years ago.

02:02:09.560 --> 02:02:10.120
That's the whole point.

02:02:10.120 --> 02:02:11.080
Don't you understand?

02:02:11.080 --> 02:02:12.800
I need a job.

02:02:12.800 --> 02:02:13.800
Don't you understand?

02:02:13.800 --> 02:02:14.800
That's the whole point.

02:02:14.800 --> 02:02:16.360
That's the funniest part about it.

02:02:16.360 --> 02:02:18.800
What better way to get back at something

02:02:18.800 --> 02:02:21.080
that you hate than to be part of it

02:02:21.080 --> 02:02:23.880
and then be a complete asshole on it.

02:02:23.880 --> 02:02:24.960
It would be awesome.

02:02:24.960 --> 02:02:26.200
Rob, for real though.

02:02:26.200 --> 02:02:27.400
I don't want to win.

02:02:27.400 --> 02:02:30.440
I just want to be on the show.

02:02:30.440 --> 02:02:32.720
And see, I want a job.

02:02:32.720 --> 02:02:33.680
Thank you, Frisbee.

02:02:33.680 --> 02:02:37.000
I want to be the very best that no one ever was.

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:38.160
I want a job.

02:02:38.160 --> 02:02:41.320
Hey, any of you people listening to the show, I'm talented.

02:02:41.320 --> 02:02:42.920
Hire me.

02:02:42.920 --> 02:02:46.840
Because honestly though, because I was thinking about it,

02:02:46.840 --> 02:02:50.120
I would, if the job equivalency is what I'm thinking of,

02:02:50.120 --> 02:02:52.200
I would be making about what I made at my old job.

02:02:52.200 --> 02:02:55.480
Will you be able to tighten up the graphics on level three?

02:02:55.480 --> 02:02:56.200
I could try.

02:02:56.200 --> 02:02:56.680
OK.

02:02:56.680 --> 02:02:57.200
No.

02:02:57.200 --> 02:02:57.720
Hold on, hold on.

02:02:57.720 --> 02:02:59.920
I want to just show dark soccer this real quick here.

02:02:59.920 --> 02:03:01.600
Dark soccer, I just want to show you this.

02:03:01.600 --> 02:03:03.720
11 elite gamers squared off to see

02:03:03.720 --> 02:03:06.680
who had what it takes to be an official PlayStation game

02:03:06.680 --> 02:03:07.200
tester.

02:03:07.200 --> 02:03:09.160
Oh, no.

02:03:09.160 --> 02:03:11.480
Cyrus, you've won.

02:03:11.480 --> 02:03:14.360
Now it's time to usher in a new generation.

02:03:14.360 --> 02:03:17.880
Welcome to the tester season two.

02:03:17.880 --> 02:03:19.920
And this time, even you got to.

02:03:19.920 --> 02:03:21.440
I mean, look at all those douchebags.

02:03:21.440 --> 02:03:23.600
You really are going to have to team play with them.

02:03:23.600 --> 02:03:25.080
You do know that, right?

02:03:25.080 --> 02:03:30.560
Well, you see, as Rob, as one of superior intellect,

02:03:30.560 --> 02:03:33.000
I would actually manipulate them into failure.

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:34.520
Pick one of the contestants.

02:03:34.520 --> 02:03:37.000
Congratulations, 8-Bit Mickey.

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:38.840
These 12 gamers will be living together

02:03:38.840 --> 02:03:39.840
in PlayStation Paradise.

02:03:39.840 --> 02:03:41.600
Well, if that guy got voted in, you will, too.

02:03:41.600 --> 02:03:44.360
I am one with the video games.

02:03:44.360 --> 02:03:46.760
I want to hurt him so bad.

02:03:46.760 --> 02:03:50.400
I'm going to dance with the tester to be the next PlayStation

02:03:50.400 --> 02:03:51.400
game tester.

02:03:51.400 --> 02:03:53.440
They had to do a dancing competition.

02:03:53.440 --> 02:03:55.760
Are you going to do a dancing competition, Darzana?

02:03:55.760 --> 02:03:57.960
I got rhythm.

02:03:57.960 --> 02:03:59.280
I'll do a Para Para.

02:03:59.280 --> 02:04:03.280
She didn't even miss a beat in saying that, I got rhythm.

02:04:03.280 --> 02:04:04.080
Have you seen?

02:04:04.080 --> 02:04:06.560
Now, this is hilarious, because Joystick

02:04:06.560 --> 02:04:10.040
decided that they made casting videos for each one

02:04:10.040 --> 02:04:11.400
of the people on their staff.

02:04:11.400 --> 02:04:12.360
Nice.

02:04:12.360 --> 02:04:12.920
Well played.

02:04:12.920 --> 02:04:14.320
They have some really funny ones.

02:04:14.320 --> 02:04:15.280
Well played.

02:04:15.280 --> 02:04:18.720
No, seriously, Rob, I'll do Para Para.

02:04:18.720 --> 02:04:20.800
It's fine.

02:04:20.800 --> 02:04:21.960
I hope you get the job.

02:04:21.960 --> 02:04:23.680
I legit hope you get the job.

02:04:23.680 --> 02:04:27.440
Well, bring the video camera and show off my Baymani

02:04:27.440 --> 02:04:31.160
and all this other quality PlayStation shit I have.

02:04:31.160 --> 02:04:33.480
I mean, quality PlayStation products

02:04:33.480 --> 02:04:36.160
that I've spent my good, hard-earned money on

02:04:36.160 --> 02:04:39.080
and my first-generation PlayStation 3,

02:04:39.080 --> 02:04:41.520
so I can say, look, Linux.

02:04:41.520 --> 02:04:45.320
I mean, look, it plays PS1 games.

02:04:45.320 --> 02:04:47.720
Zether is linking me to a YouTube saying,

02:04:47.720 --> 02:04:49.320
this was a tester contestant.

02:04:49.320 --> 02:04:50.600
I can't wait to see this here.

02:04:50.600 --> 02:04:51.120
Let's see.

02:04:51.120 --> 02:04:53.120
Watch out, they're coming through the window.

02:04:53.120 --> 02:04:55.600
Watch out, they're coming through the window.

02:04:55.600 --> 02:04:57.080
They're coming through the window.

02:04:57.080 --> 02:04:58.080
Coming through the window.

02:04:58.080 --> 02:04:59.080
Coming through the window.

02:04:59.080 --> 02:05:00.560
Oh, I got a hell yeah.

02:05:00.560 --> 02:05:03.840
Is that Rebecca Black?

02:05:03.840 --> 02:05:07.600
Sure, yes, it's Rebecca Black, DarkSakura.

02:05:07.600 --> 02:05:09.680
All grown up.

02:05:09.680 --> 02:05:12.520
I just want to say, if you go on the show, that's going to be you.

02:05:12.520 --> 02:05:14.720
Can we get a hey, they're coming through the window?

02:05:14.720 --> 02:05:15.840
Come on, DarkSakura.

02:05:15.840 --> 02:05:18.880
Bite my ass.

02:05:18.880 --> 02:05:19.920
You're not a team player.

02:05:19.920 --> 02:05:23.800
You lied when you said you were a team player.

02:05:23.800 --> 02:05:28.720
All right, Loki, let's move on with some actual gaming news.

02:05:28.720 --> 02:05:34.360
Maroon 5 has decided to join in the lawsuits

02:05:34.360 --> 02:05:37.600
against Activision over Guitar Hero.

02:05:37.600 --> 02:05:39.040
In this case, it's Band Hero.

02:05:39.040 --> 02:05:42.400
He is suing because of Activision

02:05:42.400 --> 02:05:45.520
improbably uses like this in Band Hero,

02:05:45.520 --> 02:05:48.200
and you know the drill, OK?

02:05:48.200 --> 02:05:50.120
He thought he was only singing his song,

02:05:50.120 --> 02:05:52.160
but then he ended up singing all these songs,

02:05:52.160 --> 02:05:56.800
and now he doesn't like that because it cheapens him

02:05:56.800 --> 02:05:59.360
as an artist or some shit.

02:05:59.360 --> 02:06:04.640
Being a judge on The Voice didn't already do that.

02:06:04.640 --> 02:06:10.200
Yeah, it was great because he did the motion capture

02:06:10.200 --> 02:06:12.760
to have his avatar used in the Band Hero song,

02:06:12.760 --> 02:06:15.600
She Will Be Loved, but didn't give Activision permission

02:06:15.600 --> 02:06:18.680
to use his likeness with other songs, which it totally did.

02:06:18.680 --> 02:06:20.280
Déjà vu from like a year ago.

02:06:20.280 --> 02:06:22.600
Levine alleges Activision asked other artists

02:06:22.600 --> 02:06:24.120
for expanded use of their avatars

02:06:24.120 --> 02:06:25.560
and paid them more for the process.

02:06:28.840 --> 02:06:31.800
Wow, it's last year all over again.

02:06:31.800 --> 02:06:33.720
Really?

02:06:33.720 --> 02:06:35.000
Yeah.

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:37.640
And of course, the same thing happened with No Doubt.

02:06:37.640 --> 02:06:40.480
Do you think they just want a piece of the money as well?

02:06:40.480 --> 02:06:43.120
I guess that's really what it's got to do with, huh?

02:06:43.120 --> 02:06:44.320
I don't care.

02:06:44.320 --> 02:06:45.480
I don't even care.

02:06:45.480 --> 02:06:47.400
I mean, because boo fucking who?

02:06:47.400 --> 02:06:48.400
Get over it.

02:06:48.400 --> 02:06:49.400
I mean, seriously.

02:06:49.400 --> 02:06:49.920
Oh, no.

02:06:49.920 --> 02:06:55.840
You're in a game singing other people's songs in their voice.

02:06:55.840 --> 02:06:57.040
It's an avatar.

02:06:57.040 --> 02:06:57.960
Who cares?

02:06:57.960 --> 02:07:00.720
No one made you like, no one drugged you up

02:07:00.720 --> 02:07:04.520
and made you sing those songs on stage for like a live concert

02:07:04.520 --> 02:07:05.480
or something like that.

02:07:05.480 --> 02:07:11.520
It's a digital character, not really you.

02:07:11.520 --> 02:07:14.320
I mean, they don't steal your soul and put it into the game.

02:07:14.320 --> 02:07:17.680
I mean, unless you may think that's how it works,

02:07:17.680 --> 02:07:18.960
it's not really you.

02:07:18.960 --> 02:07:21.320
My art is my soul.

02:07:21.320 --> 02:07:24.040
And when I sing a Miley Cyrus song in these games,

02:07:24.040 --> 02:07:25.520
that's raping my art.

02:07:28.520 --> 02:07:29.560
Well, here's the problem.

02:07:29.560 --> 02:07:32.000
I did not want to hear anything about Miley Cyrus and rape.

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:34.760
You put your songs into Band Hero.

02:07:34.760 --> 02:07:39.160
Band Hero, which is the poppy version of Guitar Hero.

02:07:39.160 --> 02:07:42.040
You should have really put your stuff in the Guitar Hero,

02:07:42.040 --> 02:07:44.920
not Band Hero, or Rock Band.

02:07:44.920 --> 02:07:48.040
Suck with Rock Band.

02:07:48.040 --> 02:07:50.360
All right.

02:07:50.360 --> 02:07:52.600
I don't know what to make of this next story.

02:07:52.600 --> 02:07:55.040
Let's see what you guys think of it.

02:07:55.040 --> 02:07:57.320
Let's see.

02:07:57.320 --> 02:08:00.160
Pete Hines from Bethesda Softworks

02:08:00.160 --> 02:08:03.120
figured that February 18th would be the perfect day

02:08:03.120 --> 02:08:06.920
to conceive a child, as the baby would be due on November 11th,

02:08:06.920 --> 02:08:12.160
which would be the ship date for the Elder Scrolls V Skyrim.

02:08:12.160 --> 02:08:13.960
There's another couple, though, that

02:08:13.960 --> 02:08:16.920
has conceived a little bit earlier than that.

02:08:16.920 --> 02:08:17.440
Let's see.

02:08:17.440 --> 02:08:21.840
Atari Lin, I guess, is the child,

02:08:21.840 --> 02:08:27.480
decided to come out of the mom's womb

02:08:27.480 --> 02:08:32.760
as mom and dad sat down for the half hour demo of the Bethesda

02:08:32.760 --> 02:08:36.080
Skyrim demo at QuakeCon.

02:08:36.080 --> 02:08:38.640
The father talked to Game Informer

02:08:38.640 --> 02:08:41.840
that, I guess, the sight of the Frost Dragon on the screen

02:08:41.840 --> 02:08:45.640
sent mom into labor.

02:08:45.640 --> 02:08:49.240
The couple hung around, rather than dashing for the hospital,

02:08:49.240 --> 02:08:52.160
because they thought it might be false labor.

02:08:52.160 --> 02:08:54.480
And she loves Skyrim.

02:08:57.440 --> 02:08:59.560
They named the baby, apparently, Atari Lin.

02:09:03.560 --> 02:09:04.760
Dorks.

02:09:04.760 --> 02:09:07.560
You know, they are one letter away from Atari Linx.

02:09:07.560 --> 02:09:11.000
They made a baby.

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:13.400
And they went into labor.

02:09:13.400 --> 02:09:15.280
But they didn't go to the hospital right away.

02:09:15.280 --> 02:09:16.880
So the baby drowned at the thing?

02:09:16.880 --> 02:09:17.400
Yeah.

02:09:17.400 --> 02:09:19.920
Well, they did want to miss the demo, Dark Soccer.

02:09:19.920 --> 02:09:23.480
This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to see Skyrim.

02:09:23.480 --> 02:09:25.560
You know, it's not a once in a lifetime opportunity,

02:09:25.560 --> 02:09:29.320
because you can see the game when it comes out.

02:09:29.320 --> 02:09:32.800
You know, Dark Soccer, you're not being a team player.

02:09:32.800 --> 02:09:33.960
I'm not on his team.

02:09:33.960 --> 02:09:37.120
I'm on the team of smart people.

02:09:37.120 --> 02:09:41.240
Apparently, Kotaku, who first broke this story, so to speak,

02:09:41.240 --> 02:09:43.480
was actually contacted by the mother.

02:09:43.480 --> 02:09:45.920
They're saying that she's actually still in labor

02:09:45.920 --> 02:09:47.120
and reading the comments.

02:09:47.120 --> 02:09:50.000
But I guess they are still naming the baby Atari.

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:52.400
The name Atari comes from the name Ataru,

02:09:52.400 --> 02:09:54.200
which means to hit a target.

02:09:54.200 --> 02:09:55.040
Yeah, they're just.

02:09:55.040 --> 02:09:59.640
Yeah, that's what they named the baby after is to hit a target.

02:09:59.640 --> 02:10:01.200
Ataru, hit a target.

02:10:01.200 --> 02:10:02.920
This baby is going to be a bullet.

02:10:02.920 --> 02:10:04.040
It's going to hit a target.

02:10:04.040 --> 02:10:06.560
Not naming it after a game system

02:10:06.560 --> 02:10:09.680
that these geeks obviously named their kid after.

02:10:09.680 --> 02:10:12.560
They also do say, we assume by the time she's in high school,

02:10:12.560 --> 02:10:14.040
most of the children her age are not

02:10:14.040 --> 02:10:17.000
going to know what an Atari is.

02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:18.840
No, that's not true.

02:10:18.840 --> 02:10:21.520
They should know.

02:10:21.520 --> 02:10:23.600
That's not true.

02:10:23.600 --> 02:10:25.520
Man, you know, it's just like, can you

02:10:25.520 --> 02:10:28.080
imagine when the kid wants to know someday, like, you know,

02:10:28.080 --> 02:10:29.680
tell me the story about how it was before.

02:10:29.680 --> 02:10:31.520
That is so retarded.

02:10:31.520 --> 02:10:33.080
I mean, seriously, oh, they're not

02:10:33.080 --> 02:10:34.600
going to know what an Atari is.

02:10:34.600 --> 02:10:35.080
Really?

02:10:35.080 --> 02:10:38.480
Because children don't learn history?

02:10:38.480 --> 02:10:42.000
Oh my god, what is, you know, the 13 colonies?

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:44.960
I don't even know because I wasn't alive then.

02:10:44.960 --> 02:10:49.920
Well, OK, name five movie stars from the 1940s.

02:10:49.920 --> 02:10:52.040
Go.

02:10:52.040 --> 02:10:53.480
I don't fucking watch movies.

02:10:53.480 --> 02:10:56.360
See, you couldn't do it, so maybe they can't do it.

02:10:56.360 --> 02:10:57.600
I don't know.

02:10:57.600 --> 02:11:02.600
Maybe that's the thought behind it.

02:11:02.600 --> 02:11:04.080
Uh, Fay Wray.

02:11:04.080 --> 02:11:06.080
All right, let's shoot some of the 30s.

02:11:06.080 --> 02:11:06.600
Shit.

02:11:06.600 --> 02:11:07.520
Earn his Borg 9.

02:11:07.520 --> 02:11:08.040
All right.

02:11:08.040 --> 02:11:08.680
He's old enough.

02:11:11.960 --> 02:11:15.160
Moving on, another story about Skyrim real quick.

02:11:15.160 --> 02:11:17.720
I guess Skyrim, you know, it's going to cost $60,

02:11:17.720 --> 02:11:19.680
but there hopefully will be like thousands

02:11:19.680 --> 02:11:21.200
of hours of gameplay in this game

02:11:21.200 --> 02:11:22.360
that make it worth the $60.

02:11:22.360 --> 02:11:23.440
300 hours is what they're saying.

02:11:23.440 --> 02:11:24.960
That's still pretty fucking good.

02:11:24.960 --> 02:11:26.080
That is a long time.

02:11:26.080 --> 02:11:26.880
That's a long time.

02:11:26.880 --> 02:11:28.880
The original Oblivion was 100 hours.

02:11:28.880 --> 02:11:32.080
So here's the interesting comment, though,

02:11:32.080 --> 02:11:34.320
from Skyrim director Todd Howard.

02:11:34.320 --> 02:11:37.480
It's speaking to PSM3, one of the magazines there.

02:11:37.480 --> 02:11:40.800
I do think industry-wide we would benefit from more games

02:11:40.800 --> 02:11:43.560
out at $19 or $29.

02:11:43.560 --> 02:11:45.640
I would try more games because I'm not

02:11:45.640 --> 02:11:47.400
going to try a game for $60.

02:11:47.400 --> 02:11:48.920
It's a tough decision.

02:11:48.920 --> 02:11:51.760
But then they went on to say that, yes, the $60 price

02:11:51.760 --> 02:11:53.560
point is still what Skyrim's going to be at.

02:11:53.560 --> 02:11:56.520
So there should be more games at $19 and $29,

02:11:56.520 --> 02:11:59.160
but Skyrim's still $60, just so you know.

02:11:59.160 --> 02:11:59.880
I hate to say it.

02:11:59.880 --> 02:12:02.200
OK, all joking aside, the irony aside,

02:12:02.200 --> 02:12:03.840
he kind of does have a point, though.

02:12:03.840 --> 02:12:06.560
If games overall were kind of cheaper,

02:12:06.560 --> 02:12:08.840
it wouldn't feel like such a loss to try a game at $19

02:12:08.840 --> 02:12:09.560
or $29.

02:12:09.560 --> 02:12:11.440
I think the fact of the matter is most games

02:12:11.440 --> 02:12:12.840
aren't worth $60.

02:12:12.840 --> 02:12:16.000
300 hours out of a game, I mean, that's

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:17.680
unheard of in most cases.

02:12:17.680 --> 02:12:22.560
If only there were a way to try games before you bought them,

02:12:22.560 --> 02:12:28.120
we could call it rent team or demos.

02:12:31.120 --> 02:12:34.880
If only such things existed in modern society,

02:12:34.880 --> 02:12:38.440
but us being so barbaric, have not

02:12:38.440 --> 02:12:42.920
had the foresight to create such wonderful implementations

02:12:42.920 --> 02:12:46.880
of trials.

02:12:46.880 --> 02:12:47.840
But yes, you're right.

02:12:47.840 --> 02:12:50.840
We should tell the studios that spend millions of dollars

02:12:50.840 --> 02:12:52.560
in production to, hey, you know what?

02:12:52.560 --> 02:12:53.920
You need to put your game out for $2,

02:12:53.920 --> 02:12:56.240
because no one's really going to buy it unless it's $2.

02:12:59.680 --> 02:13:01.600
Well, on the iPhone, I mean, a lot of people

02:13:01.600 --> 02:13:02.600
will buy games at $99.

02:13:02.600 --> 02:13:04.040
Unless he puts out Skyrim for $19.99,

02:13:04.040 --> 02:13:05.500
I don't fucking care what he wants.

02:13:05.500 --> 02:13:07.960
Skyrim will be $19.99 in like three years

02:13:07.960 --> 02:13:09.560
during the Steam sale.

02:13:09.560 --> 02:13:12.600
Oblivion was on sale either yesterday or today.

02:13:12.600 --> 02:13:14.960
Oh my god, it was like the super hello Uber edition

02:13:14.960 --> 02:13:16.240
for like $10.

02:13:16.240 --> 02:13:19.040
Like everything, everything that they ever put out

02:13:19.040 --> 02:13:23.480
for Oblivion for like $10.

02:13:23.480 --> 02:13:25.600
Anyhow, Dark Sakura, I know you're

02:13:25.600 --> 02:13:27.560
working on your application, but do you have enough time

02:13:27.560 --> 02:13:28.680
for another story for us?

02:13:28.680 --> 02:13:30.240
I sure do.

02:13:30.240 --> 02:13:33.000
Well, you know they just had the Evo tournament.

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:34.560
Well, they're going to have to relearn

02:13:34.560 --> 02:13:37.160
all their characters all over again, at least for Super

02:13:37.160 --> 02:13:39.200
Street Fighter 4 arcade edition.

02:13:39.200 --> 02:13:42.840
Patch is coming out that will rebalance the game.

02:13:42.840 --> 02:13:45.360
So right now it's really imbalanced,

02:13:45.360 --> 02:13:46.840
so they're hoping to fix it.

02:13:46.840 --> 02:13:51.160
It's going to be version 2012.

02:13:51.160 --> 02:13:52.840
And they did it outside of Evo.

02:13:52.840 --> 02:13:56.880
Yoshinori Ono actually said that they've been location testing

02:13:56.880 --> 02:14:00.040
the version in Japan.

02:14:00.040 --> 02:14:02.200
So there, you don't have to buy it again.

02:14:02.200 --> 02:14:04.960
You just have to download the patch.

02:14:04.960 --> 02:14:07.120
Well, that's good that it's just a patch this time,

02:14:07.120 --> 02:14:09.180
and yet not another way to milk more money out

02:14:09.180 --> 02:14:10.800
of the same damn game as they've been doing

02:14:10.800 --> 02:14:11.880
for the past three years.

02:14:11.880 --> 02:14:14.720
I know right, I know right.

02:14:14.720 --> 02:14:15.200
That's it.

02:14:15.200 --> 02:14:16.200
All right.

02:14:16.200 --> 02:14:17.640
Just a couple more stories for you guys,

02:14:17.640 --> 02:14:21.080
and we're going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

02:14:21.080 --> 02:14:23.080
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:14:23.080 --> 02:14:24.760
And we'll get to your Twitter topics

02:14:24.760 --> 02:14:27.080
as well at twitter.com slash O-L-R.

02:14:27.080 --> 02:14:28.980
But first, a couple last stories for you.

02:14:28.980 --> 02:14:29.480
Loki?

02:14:32.120 --> 02:14:33.200
Loki?

02:14:33.200 --> 02:14:33.680
OK.

02:14:33.680 --> 02:14:35.560
Sorry.

02:14:35.560 --> 02:14:36.640
So one last thing.

02:14:36.640 --> 02:14:40.240
This is kind of interesting.

02:14:40.240 --> 02:14:43.360
Remember how we talked about Pac-Man and Galaga dimensions

02:14:43.360 --> 02:14:45.480
last week, and how they were kind of following suit

02:14:45.480 --> 02:14:49.480
with what Capcom did with Resident Evil?

02:14:49.480 --> 02:14:51.720
Thankfully, that wasn't the case, actually.

02:14:51.720 --> 02:14:54.820
Namco Bandai came out and said, actually, there

02:14:54.820 --> 02:14:59.000
is a way to reset your game saves on our game.

02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:01.560
And what you do is basically, upon startup,

02:15:01.560 --> 02:15:05.200
players can input the command ABXYLR,

02:15:05.200 --> 02:15:08.600
and it will wipe the save data from the cartridge.

02:15:08.600 --> 02:15:12.560
How they should have done it on all the games.

02:15:12.560 --> 02:15:15.840
Resident Evil Capcom.

02:15:15.840 --> 02:15:18.240
But yeah.

02:15:18.240 --> 02:15:21.080
So there was a secret code the whole time just hiding out

02:15:21.080 --> 02:15:22.080
there behind the couch.

02:15:22.080 --> 02:15:22.580
Who knew?

02:15:22.580 --> 02:15:24.720
Yeah, unfortunately, that's not the case with Capcom's.

02:15:24.720 --> 02:15:26.160
Do you think that might be one of those things

02:15:26.160 --> 02:15:28.240
that they kind of announced it now just to kind of like cover

02:15:28.240 --> 02:15:28.880
their ass?

02:15:28.880 --> 02:15:31.760
Yeah, that's exactly why they did it.

02:15:31.760 --> 02:15:32.480
Interesting.

02:15:32.480 --> 02:15:34.600
Because everyone's like, phew, OK.

02:15:34.600 --> 02:15:38.280
Maybe I will buy the game.

02:15:38.280 --> 02:15:41.040
That's interesting, though, that there was kind of like,

02:15:41.040 --> 02:15:43.360
this feature probably existed for the purposes

02:15:43.360 --> 02:15:44.920
of like testing the game.

02:15:44.920 --> 02:15:46.080
Dark Soccer, you might want to listen up,

02:15:46.080 --> 02:15:47.200
because this could be your future career.

02:15:47.200 --> 02:15:48.040
I am listening.

02:15:48.040 --> 02:15:52.840
This could be something that was there for the testers

02:15:52.840 --> 02:15:53.840
to use that they did.

02:15:53.840 --> 02:15:55.920
Because sometimes that's where a lot of these codes

02:15:55.920 --> 02:15:58.960
come from is like the play testing of the game, right?

02:15:58.960 --> 02:15:59.880
Like a lot of those.

02:15:59.880 --> 02:16:00.680
Like the Contra code.

02:16:00.680 --> 02:16:04.480
Yeah, all that stuff came from like play testing and so forth.

02:16:04.480 --> 02:16:06.840
So sometimes those codes kind of get out.

02:16:06.840 --> 02:16:11.920
Maybe, just maybe, could one actually exist in the Capcom game?

02:16:11.920 --> 02:16:13.520
I'm sure.

02:16:13.520 --> 02:16:16.280
So maybe there's an A-B-X-Y-L-R type of thing

02:16:16.280 --> 02:16:19.280
that maybe will save the day for Capcom, too?

02:16:19.280 --> 02:16:20.960
Could possibly be, who knows?

02:16:20.960 --> 02:16:22.720
Probably don't hold your breath, though, right?

02:16:22.720 --> 02:16:25.760
Yeah, or else like you'd need like a dev system or something.

02:16:25.760 --> 02:16:27.160
I don't know.

02:16:27.160 --> 02:16:29.000
And I'm noticing this comment from our chat room.

02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:31.600
RDGSinge says, so are they backpedaling?

02:16:31.600 --> 02:16:34.280
Do you consider this backpedaling, Loki?

02:16:34.280 --> 02:16:38.680
No, because I don't really think they, I mean,

02:16:38.680 --> 02:16:40.080
OK, maybe a little bit.

02:16:40.080 --> 02:16:42.160
Just because they did say, well, the whole purpose

02:16:42.160 --> 02:16:42.920
was to do that.

02:16:42.920 --> 02:16:45.320
What they should have said, yeah, well, you know,

02:16:45.320 --> 02:16:48.080
we originally wanted it to be that this

02:16:48.080 --> 02:16:50.160
is kind of an arcade experience, and that's

02:16:50.160 --> 02:16:51.640
why you don't have this.

02:16:51.640 --> 02:16:54.840
But if you really do want to erase your save,

02:16:54.840 --> 02:16:56.760
then here's how you go about and do it.

02:16:56.760 --> 02:17:00.400
That would have been the proper response.

02:17:00.400 --> 02:17:02.680
But instead, they said like, they

02:17:02.680 --> 02:17:04.360
sent out something cryptic that looked

02:17:04.360 --> 02:17:08.320
like trying to like crack a code from that horrible Nicolas

02:17:08.320 --> 02:17:09.520
Cage movie or something.

02:17:09.520 --> 02:17:11.320
Like, it's just like, what the hell is this?

02:17:11.320 --> 02:17:13.320
Who's drunk at Namco right now?

02:17:13.320 --> 02:17:14.840
But you know what, though?

02:17:14.840 --> 02:17:17.320
In the end, all that matters is the end response,

02:17:17.320 --> 02:17:21.320
and their game has a code, Capcom's doesn't.

02:17:21.320 --> 02:17:24.520
So guess which one will be most likely purchased?

02:17:24.520 --> 02:17:25.960
True enough.

02:17:25.960 --> 02:17:27.600
I was on the fence about this game,

02:17:27.600 --> 02:17:31.040
and now I'm back in the maybe I will buy it column.

02:17:31.040 --> 02:17:32.960
Anyhow, one other story for you guys,

02:17:32.960 --> 02:17:34.840
and I know some of you are looking forward to this game.

02:17:34.840 --> 02:17:37.120
It's not a game I play a lot of, but I know a lot of you

02:17:37.120 --> 02:17:39.080
play it, Modern Warfare 3.

02:17:39.080 --> 02:17:40.980
Yeah, Modern Warfare 3 is coming out.

02:17:40.980 --> 02:17:42.360
And I remember we were talking earlier

02:17:42.360 --> 02:17:44.720
in the show about Activision Blizzard had a conference call.

02:17:44.720 --> 02:17:47.200
Well, something they confirmed about Modern Warfare 3.

02:17:47.200 --> 02:17:49.440
I know it's going to make some of you guys very happy,

02:17:49.440 --> 02:17:50.720
some of you holdouts.

02:17:50.720 --> 02:17:53.080
It's going to be available on the Wii.

02:17:53.080 --> 02:17:53.760
That's right.

02:17:53.760 --> 02:17:57.440
Check out that cutting edge graphics and technology

02:17:57.440 --> 02:17:58.980
on the Wii.

02:17:58.980 --> 02:18:01.960
Modern Warfare 3 is going to be available on the Wii

02:18:01.960 --> 02:18:05.820
this holiday, apparently on November 8th,

02:18:05.820 --> 02:18:08.020
right when all the other versions of the game come out.

02:18:08.020 --> 02:18:10.480
And it's being made by Treyarch, of course,

02:18:10.480 --> 02:18:13.980
who also made World of War, and Black Ops, and Call of Duty 3,

02:18:13.980 --> 02:18:14.920
and so forth.

02:18:14.920 --> 02:18:16.760
Yes, they are doing the Wii port as well,

02:18:16.760 --> 02:18:20.640
since they have the experience working with that platform.

02:18:20.640 --> 02:18:24.000
They did do Spider-Man, Web of Shadows.

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:24.760
So there you go.

02:18:24.760 --> 02:18:27.000
I'm sure tons of you are pre-ordering your copy.

02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:30.040
I'm sure that will be the way to play the game is on the Wii.

02:18:30.040 --> 02:18:31.800
Am I right?

02:18:31.800 --> 02:18:36.440
Modern Warfare 3 will be able to play online.

02:18:36.440 --> 02:18:37.440
Wait, no.

02:18:37.440 --> 02:18:38.920
You'll be able to play in HD.

02:18:38.920 --> 02:18:40.280
Wait, no.

02:18:40.280 --> 02:18:41.760
You'll be able to have the patch it.

02:18:41.760 --> 02:18:43.400
Wait, no.

02:18:43.400 --> 02:18:44.920
Well, somebody I'm sure out there

02:18:44.920 --> 02:18:48.520
will benefit from Modern Warfare 3 being out there on the Wii.

02:18:48.520 --> 02:18:53.040
Or as Zethur in the chat room is calling it, Modern Wii Fair.

02:18:53.040 --> 02:18:54.040
I like that name for it.

02:18:54.040 --> 02:18:55.400
It makes it sound cute.

02:18:55.400 --> 02:18:58.240
Modern Wii Fair.

02:18:58.240 --> 02:19:02.160
That sounds kind of like a personal problem.

02:19:02.160 --> 02:19:03.240
Never mind.

02:19:03.240 --> 02:19:06.960
All right, let's go to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

02:19:06.960 --> 02:19:09.200
Or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:19:09.200 --> 02:19:11.920
The Skype line is open right now.

02:19:11.920 --> 02:19:13.320
But while we wait for some calls,

02:19:13.320 --> 02:19:17.720
let's do some Twitter topics at twitter.com slash O-L-R.

02:19:17.720 --> 02:19:20.040
I want to start from this one from TigerClaw305,

02:19:20.040 --> 02:19:22.340
because it's news that we forgot to mention.

02:19:22.340 --> 02:19:23.760
And I think it's kind of important.

02:19:23.760 --> 02:19:26.600
Metroid turned 25 this week.

02:19:26.600 --> 02:19:29.080
All the old NES games are turning 25, right?

02:19:29.080 --> 02:19:30.240
Mario turned 25.

02:19:30.240 --> 02:19:32.240
I think Zelda's 25 pretty soon.

02:19:32.240 --> 02:19:34.880
Metroid as well, or Zelda did turn 25.

02:19:34.880 --> 02:19:36.560
That was part of what they did at E3.

02:19:36.560 --> 02:19:39.280
Metroid just turned 25 this past week.

02:19:39.280 --> 02:19:40.520
Yay.

02:19:40.520 --> 02:19:44.440
In related news, you're old.

02:19:44.440 --> 02:19:47.200
Because I'm sure many of you have played Metroid in the past.

02:19:47.200 --> 02:19:48.920
And that's now a 25-year-old game.

02:19:48.920 --> 02:19:50.560
Dark Soccer, how does that make you feel

02:19:50.560 --> 02:19:53.400
that Metroid is a 25-year-old game?

02:19:53.400 --> 02:19:56.200
Perky.

02:19:56.200 --> 02:19:59.120
Perky and full of ice cream.

02:19:59.120 --> 02:20:01.320
Moving on to other tweets while we wait for some calls.

02:20:01.320 --> 02:20:03.040
Again, the Skype line is open right now.

02:20:03.040 --> 02:20:05.680
1877 to Game O-L-R, or as your name on Skype

02:20:05.680 --> 02:20:06.680
is Orange Launch Radio.

02:20:06.680 --> 02:20:08.400
Of course, right as I say that, we get some calls.

02:20:08.400 --> 02:20:09.320
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:20:09.320 --> 02:20:10.160
Who's this?

02:20:10.160 --> 02:20:11.480
It's the one and only Ranma.

02:20:11.480 --> 02:20:13.640
Hey, one and only Ranma, what's up?

02:20:13.640 --> 02:20:15.320
Not too much.

02:20:15.320 --> 02:20:18.280
I have a, not a question, but something

02:20:18.280 --> 02:20:20.400
I want to discuss from a podcast a couple of weeks

02:20:20.400 --> 02:20:22.400
ago, if we can rewind back just a bit.

02:20:22.400 --> 02:20:24.360
I guess.

02:20:24.360 --> 02:20:26.720
Well, I wanted to talk about it last week,

02:20:26.720 --> 02:20:28.760
but it would have been too much for me to cover.

02:20:28.760 --> 02:20:30.360
So you know, I have to spread it out.

02:20:30.360 --> 02:20:31.520
Mm-hmm.

02:20:31.520 --> 02:20:32.160
Yeah.

02:20:32.160 --> 02:20:34.800
So if you remember, a couple of weeks ago,

02:20:34.800 --> 02:20:39.320
you posted on your profile an article about sports games.

02:20:39.320 --> 02:20:40.560
Yes.

02:20:40.560 --> 02:20:42.080
Now, I was thinking about that.

02:20:42.080 --> 02:20:43.960
And it's like how the person said

02:20:43.960 --> 02:20:48.000
that you could say Mario Kart is also a sports game.

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:49.640
OK, I do remember this.

02:20:49.640 --> 02:20:51.320
Wasn't it the whole article about don't

02:20:51.320 --> 02:20:54.000
be so harsh on sports games because sometimes they're

02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:56.400
kind of leading the way for other series of games?

02:20:56.400 --> 02:20:57.120
I remember this.

02:20:57.120 --> 02:20:58.080
OK.

02:20:58.080 --> 02:20:59.480
Yeah, pretty much.

02:20:59.480 --> 02:21:02.840
And I was thinking, well, I guess in my opinion,

02:21:02.840 --> 02:21:07.520
you can't say that Mario Kart is a sports game.

02:21:07.520 --> 02:21:12.680
That's like saying WWE is actual legitimate wrestling.

02:21:12.680 --> 02:21:14.080
But to some it is.

02:21:14.080 --> 02:21:16.240
I mean, couldn't Mario, isn't Mario Kart something

02:21:16.240 --> 02:21:19.440
you might see on The Oat Show?

02:21:19.440 --> 02:21:22.520
ESPN 8?

02:21:22.520 --> 02:21:26.120
Have you ever looked at ESPN 3?

02:21:26.120 --> 02:21:28.680
Some of that shit isn't sports either.

02:21:28.680 --> 02:21:30.040
True, true.

02:21:30.040 --> 02:21:33.560
But it's like most of the sports games,

02:21:33.560 --> 02:21:35.760
you have to have a bit of a learning curve.

02:21:35.760 --> 02:21:38.120
You have to study the manual so you

02:21:38.120 --> 02:21:40.720
know what you're doing with all the buttons, whereas with games

02:21:40.720 --> 02:21:44.120
like Mario Kart and any of the Mario titles,

02:21:44.120 --> 02:21:45.960
you just pick up the game and start playing.

02:21:45.960 --> 02:21:48.480
You don't have to learn any strategies or tactics

02:21:48.480 --> 02:21:49.360
or anything like that.

02:21:49.360 --> 02:21:52.240
It's like a pick up and play.

02:21:52.240 --> 02:21:55.000
I mean, I do understand that it can be considered a sports

02:21:55.000 --> 02:21:58.000
title, but on the same token, it's not because it's just

02:21:58.000 --> 02:21:59.720
a fun game to pick up and play.

02:21:59.720 --> 02:22:02.880
I mean, a lot of sports games you can pick up and play too,

02:22:02.880 --> 02:22:04.320
especially the old school ones.

02:22:04.320 --> 02:22:05.840
OK, what's the goal of basketball?

02:22:05.840 --> 02:22:06.880
Throw ball in net?

02:22:06.880 --> 02:22:07.960
All right, I can do that.

02:22:07.960 --> 02:22:08.440
Let's go.

02:22:08.440 --> 02:22:10.440
Of course, of course.

02:22:10.440 --> 02:22:11.680
Look at Tecmo Bowl.

02:22:11.680 --> 02:22:14.400
I mean, yeah, that was a sports game, but on the same token,

02:22:14.400 --> 02:22:14.880
it wasn't.

02:22:14.880 --> 02:22:17.840
All you had to do was push in the command for your play,

02:22:17.840 --> 02:22:19.880
hit the button, and that was it.

02:22:19.880 --> 02:22:22.600
It was amazing and awesome.

02:22:22.600 --> 02:22:26.200
Yes, yes, it was.

02:22:26.200 --> 02:22:29.000
So you just called in a bitch about how Mario Kart Wii is not

02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:30.400
a sport.

02:22:30.400 --> 02:22:33.160
More or less, but I understand where the person's coming from,

02:22:33.160 --> 02:22:34.960
but I guess from the way I look at it,

02:22:34.960 --> 02:22:38.560
it's not really a sports title, even though it

02:22:38.560 --> 02:22:41.760
can be considered that, but I'm just saying that's my opinion.

02:22:41.760 --> 02:22:43.640
Fine, it's not a sports title.

02:22:43.640 --> 02:22:45.400
Now what?

02:22:45.400 --> 02:22:47.560
It's a family fun game.

02:22:47.560 --> 02:22:50.640
That's what you call it, you know?

02:22:50.640 --> 02:22:55.000
I'm just saying, whereas most of the sports games that EA puts

02:22:55.000 --> 02:22:58.560
out, you have to learn the insides and outs of it

02:22:58.560 --> 02:23:02.920
to play it really well, whereas there are other games that

02:23:02.920 --> 02:23:04.760
are sports games, but you don't need

02:23:04.760 --> 02:23:07.280
to learn the insides and outs.

02:23:07.280 --> 02:23:09.360
You just need to know what the buttons do and just

02:23:09.360 --> 02:23:12.400
start playing, and that's it.

02:23:12.400 --> 02:23:15.000
All right, fair enough.

02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:16.440
Anything else on your mind?

02:23:16.440 --> 02:23:18.240
Yeah, you should try out for the test or two.

02:23:18.240 --> 02:23:19.880
I'm not trying out for the test or two.

02:23:19.880 --> 02:23:20.840
You could be Rob.

02:23:20.840 --> 02:23:22.400
I'm fucking fabulous, bitches.

02:23:22.400 --> 02:23:22.960
Roberts.

02:23:22.960 --> 02:23:24.560
A gay guy won last season.

02:23:24.560 --> 02:23:26.720
They're not going to win two seasons in a row.

02:23:26.720 --> 02:23:28.120
Hey, it could happen.

02:23:28.120 --> 02:23:29.480
I may start a revolution.

02:23:29.480 --> 02:23:31.640
Come on, now.

02:23:31.640 --> 02:23:33.040
No, it's not.

02:23:33.040 --> 02:23:36.400
You can win it and just walk up and win it two snaps up

02:23:36.400 --> 02:23:37.960
in a b-money formation.

02:23:37.960 --> 02:23:39.400
It's time for a girl to win.

02:23:39.400 --> 02:23:41.200
But won't you vote for me?

02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:45.000
You made her cry.

02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:45.600
Way to go.

02:23:45.600 --> 02:23:46.520
That's on you, buddy.

02:23:46.520 --> 02:23:48.400
You're not a team player.

02:23:48.400 --> 02:23:49.320
Look, hold it.

02:23:49.320 --> 02:23:49.840
Back it up.

02:23:49.840 --> 02:23:51.280
Back it up here.

02:23:51.280 --> 02:23:56.360
Just so you know, I always have the back of Jamie, Loki,

02:23:56.360 --> 02:23:57.080
and Rob, always.

02:23:57.080 --> 02:23:59.200
But no matter what, I always vote for Jamie

02:23:59.200 --> 02:24:01.320
because Jamie's the number one.

02:24:01.320 --> 02:24:02.280
Simple as that.

02:24:02.280 --> 02:24:04.200
I always got Ucchan's back, no matter what.

02:24:04.200 --> 02:24:04.680
Oh, I see.

02:24:04.680 --> 02:24:06.080
Now, oh, I see.

02:24:06.080 --> 02:24:09.640
Now we've ranked the OLR hosts from most desirable

02:24:09.640 --> 02:24:10.480
to least desirable.

02:24:10.480 --> 02:24:13.080
Well, I am the cutest.

02:24:13.080 --> 02:24:14.200
No, I'm the cutest.

02:24:14.200 --> 02:24:17.640
And she put up with me for a weekend.

02:24:17.640 --> 02:24:19.520
I mean, that alone deserves a trophy.

02:24:19.520 --> 02:24:22.440
And I've got the best rack of anyone in this room.

02:24:22.440 --> 02:24:24.120
Well, no, maybe Loki's is better.

02:24:24.120 --> 02:24:27.280
Rama, I'm the cutest.

02:24:27.280 --> 02:24:30.400
You're more like the fabulous.

02:24:30.400 --> 02:24:31.120
Fine.

02:24:31.120 --> 02:24:32.880
I'm fabulous and cute.

02:24:32.880 --> 02:24:33.880
All right, bye.

02:24:33.880 --> 02:24:35.720
Bye.

02:24:35.720 --> 02:24:36.760
Let's take another call.

02:24:36.760 --> 02:24:37.560
I'm done with Rama.

02:24:37.560 --> 02:24:39.020
Hi, you're on Orange Laundry Radio.

02:24:39.020 --> 02:24:40.200
Who's this?

02:24:40.200 --> 02:24:42.240
The Werenate.

02:24:42.240 --> 02:24:43.400
What's the name?

02:24:43.400 --> 02:24:44.240
The Werenate.

02:24:44.240 --> 02:24:45.080
The Werenate.

02:24:45.080 --> 02:24:46.480
What's up?

02:24:46.480 --> 02:24:48.640
Yeah, I was calling because I want

02:24:48.640 --> 02:24:51.840
to comment on your Modern Warfare 3.

02:24:51.840 --> 02:24:54.680
Oh, you're going to be pre-ordering on the Wii?

02:24:54.680 --> 02:24:57.280
Most likely.

02:24:57.280 --> 02:24:58.000
Sucker.

02:24:58.000 --> 02:24:58.720
Why is that?

02:24:58.720 --> 02:25:00.600
Is that all you got?

02:25:00.600 --> 02:25:03.920
Yeah, because I'm a diehard Nintendo fan.

02:25:03.920 --> 02:25:06.440
Long live Nintendo.

02:25:06.440 --> 02:25:09.680
And also, I mean, I played Modern Warfare 1 on the Wii.

02:25:09.680 --> 02:25:10.640
And it was pretty nice.

02:25:10.640 --> 02:25:11.520
It had online play.

02:25:11.520 --> 02:25:13.280
Why are you saying it won't have online play?

02:25:13.280 --> 02:25:15.120
You've got to do the waggle.

02:25:15.120 --> 02:25:18.200
I'm just, it'll have online play.

02:25:18.200 --> 02:25:21.200
But it's not going to be as robust as with the voice

02:25:21.200 --> 02:25:23.480
chat and all that to say something like Xbox Live

02:25:23.480 --> 02:25:24.680
or PlayStation Network.

02:25:24.680 --> 02:25:27.360
It'll just be, which might actually, to be fair,

02:25:27.360 --> 02:25:28.320
might be for the best.

02:25:28.320 --> 02:25:30.680
Because you don't want to play those games on Xbox Live

02:25:30.680 --> 02:25:32.160
because people are just rude.

02:25:32.160 --> 02:25:35.360
I mean, if you shoot someone or blow their head off

02:25:35.360 --> 02:25:37.520
in real life, do you want to have voice chat with them

02:25:37.520 --> 02:25:40.680
or you just want to get the job done?

02:25:40.680 --> 02:25:41.560
Touche.

02:25:41.560 --> 02:25:42.320
Fine.

02:25:42.320 --> 02:25:43.920
The caller has a point.

02:25:43.920 --> 02:25:45.040
I stand corrected.

02:25:45.040 --> 02:25:47.880
Yes, I do want to have voice chat with them.

02:25:47.880 --> 02:25:48.920
Excuse me.

02:25:48.920 --> 02:25:51.640
I don't like the fact very much that you just blew off my head.

02:25:51.640 --> 02:25:54.640
I think you should promptly apologize for that, actually.

02:25:54.640 --> 02:25:57.680
Yeah, you know, so I'm a Wii user,

02:25:57.680 --> 02:25:59.960
but I can't wait for the Wii U. You know,

02:25:59.960 --> 02:26:02.680
I think you all should be glorifying the Wii U,

02:26:02.680 --> 02:26:05.400
because it's going to be a pretty epic system.

02:26:05.400 --> 02:26:08.080
Not until we see the games.

02:26:08.080 --> 02:26:09.840
What we saw at E3 wasn't enough.

02:26:09.840 --> 02:26:12.040
A system is only as good as the games that are on it.

02:26:12.040 --> 02:26:14.440
And I am not convinced yet.

02:26:14.440 --> 02:26:16.920
I mean, yes, they talked about some of these third party games,

02:26:16.920 --> 02:26:18.800
but they talked about games that are already

02:26:18.800 --> 02:26:21.720
coming out this holiday that might not even really end up

02:26:21.720 --> 02:26:22.560
in their same form.

02:26:22.560 --> 02:26:24.680
Like, they talked about the Assassin's Creed game

02:26:24.680 --> 02:26:26.560
is not the same game that's coming out

02:26:26.560 --> 02:26:29.000
this holiday for the other systems, like a separate game.

02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:32.320
So I'm not sold one way or the other on Wii U.

02:26:32.320 --> 02:26:34.960
I mean, I'll probably buy one at launch

02:26:34.960 --> 02:26:39.080
because I buy every other system at launch, but.

02:26:39.080 --> 02:26:40.480
Do you now see the tech demos?

02:26:40.480 --> 02:26:43.320
I mean, come on, it had like tech in on it.

02:26:43.320 --> 02:26:44.160
Come on.

02:26:44.160 --> 02:26:48.400
It's going to be changing to more hardcore.

02:26:48.400 --> 02:26:50.840
You suddenly sound like you're underwater, but that's all right.

02:26:50.840 --> 02:26:52.000
Dalek voice.

02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:54.320
Yes, he's got the Dalek voice going on.

02:26:54.320 --> 02:26:58.240
But I don't know.

02:26:58.240 --> 02:27:03.760
The demos, it's interesting, but let me ask you this.

02:27:03.760 --> 02:27:06.000
Can't the Vita and the PlayStation 3

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:10.560
essentially do the same thing?

02:27:10.560 --> 02:27:19.080
I'm almost muted, but the Vita is not even better than a 3DS.

02:27:19.080 --> 02:27:23.200
Well, it's got, well, I don't know about that.

02:27:23.200 --> 02:27:24.280
It's kind of relative.

02:27:24.280 --> 02:27:26.200
It depends on what games it gets.

02:27:26.200 --> 02:27:27.800
I don't know about the processors.

02:27:27.800 --> 02:27:31.880
Put them side by side, but I imagine that, sorry,

02:27:31.880 --> 02:27:34.560
Loki showing off his cheating in his game.

02:27:34.560 --> 02:27:39.000
He's cheating, getting 5 million tower bucks from cheating.

02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:41.400
That's a lot cheaper than buying that.

02:27:41.400 --> 02:27:42.360
Anyway, sorry.

02:27:42.360 --> 02:27:47.960
I would like to say that I hope that the re-ware is more,

02:27:47.960 --> 02:27:49.360
is better than what it is now.

02:27:49.360 --> 02:27:52.560
Because as a developer, I hope that I

02:27:52.560 --> 02:27:56.120
can see some better games besides that roller skating

02:27:56.120 --> 02:27:58.960
game and roller goo on there.

02:27:58.960 --> 02:28:01.200
And the one with the guys in the Speedos

02:28:01.200 --> 02:28:03.440
trying to get through the walls, that was a real fun game,

02:28:03.440 --> 02:28:04.440
actually.

02:28:04.440 --> 02:28:07.000
No, I'm glad you can say something critical

02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:09.120
about Nintendo, because I was getting a little worried

02:28:09.120 --> 02:28:10.880
that you were a little bit too much fanboy.

02:28:10.880 --> 02:28:12.080
But yes, I agree.

02:28:12.080 --> 02:28:14.680
They're online as a whole really needs to improve.

02:28:14.680 --> 02:28:15.560
So I hope they do it.

02:28:15.560 --> 02:28:18.440
But I will say the 3DS has done some things right online.

02:28:18.440 --> 02:28:19.640
So we'll see.

02:28:19.640 --> 02:28:23.960
I don't have one yet, but you can save me one if you want.

02:28:23.960 --> 02:28:24.560
We'll see.

02:28:24.560 --> 02:28:26.400
We might have a contest around the holidays.

02:28:26.400 --> 02:28:26.920
All right.

02:28:26.920 --> 02:28:29.200
Anyhow, I got to let you go so we can get more calls.

02:28:29.200 --> 02:28:30.400
But thanks for the input.

02:28:30.400 --> 02:28:31.080
Take care, buddy.

02:28:31.080 --> 02:28:31.880
Rene signing out.

02:28:31.880 --> 02:28:33.360
Later.

02:28:33.360 --> 02:28:34.680
Let's take another call here.

02:28:34.680 --> 02:28:36.020
Hi, you're on Orange Dogs Radio.

02:28:36.020 --> 02:28:36.960
Who's this?

02:28:36.960 --> 02:28:37.480
Yo, guys.

02:28:37.480 --> 02:28:38.960
It's Xenocore from the OKC.

02:28:38.960 --> 02:28:39.520
How you doing?

02:28:39.520 --> 02:28:41.720
What is up, Xenocore from OKC?

02:28:41.720 --> 02:28:43.240
What's in your mind tonight?

02:28:43.240 --> 02:28:43.720
Not much.

02:28:43.720 --> 02:28:47.200
Just been playing a bit of Earth Defense Force 2011.

02:28:47.200 --> 02:28:49.600
Oh, a game that's near and dear to Loki's heart.

02:28:49.600 --> 02:28:51.200
What do you think?

02:28:51.200 --> 02:28:53.240
It's not bad, but I'm not even sure

02:28:53.240 --> 02:28:54.480
if the game has an ending yet.

02:28:54.480 --> 02:28:56.920
I've been playing it online so I can have some backup.

02:28:56.920 --> 02:29:01.440
And every time it gets to the last minute, it just resets.

02:29:01.440 --> 02:29:03.360
Loki, is this a problem?

02:29:03.360 --> 02:29:06.640
Well, the very last mission, I mean,

02:29:06.640 --> 02:29:08.560
depends on what difficulty you're playing on.

02:29:08.560 --> 02:29:12.840
The ending's not very long.

02:29:12.840 --> 02:29:15.000
Well, I never think the ending would be that long.

02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:17.160
In this whole game, it's the gameplay itself.

02:29:17.160 --> 02:29:19.480
But I do at least want to know what the hell happened,

02:29:19.480 --> 02:29:21.960
because it's just like all your characters have vanished.

02:29:21.960 --> 02:29:23.880
Yeah, you just have to play it on a harder difficulty,

02:29:23.880 --> 02:29:26.640
because each time you beat the game on a harder difficulty,

02:29:26.640 --> 02:29:28.440
the ending's longer and longer.

02:29:28.440 --> 02:29:28.940
OK.

02:29:28.940 --> 02:29:30.320
It would have been nice if they'd

02:29:30.320 --> 02:29:32.200
be some sort of a hint, like, play this on a harder

02:29:32.200 --> 02:29:34.680
difficulty to find out what happens or something like that.

02:29:34.680 --> 02:29:39.440
Well, I think they also have DLC coming, so it's hard to say

02:29:39.440 --> 02:29:40.800
what exactly they'll be having.

02:29:40.800 --> 02:29:41.280
Let's see.

02:29:41.280 --> 02:29:45.280
And I've been playing the hell out of 4K Kill Team as well.

02:29:45.280 --> 02:29:47.360
You're cutting in and out a little bit there,

02:29:47.360 --> 02:29:48.320
but that's all right.

02:29:48.320 --> 02:29:50.680
You've been playing the hell out of what?

02:29:50.680 --> 02:29:52.600
Warhammer 40,000 Kill Team.

02:29:52.600 --> 02:29:54.600
Oh, didn't you mention this game on an earlier

02:29:54.600 --> 02:29:55.440
episode of the show?

02:29:55.440 --> 02:29:56.360
I think you did.

02:29:56.360 --> 02:29:58.360
Yeah, I finally grabbed the whole thing.

02:29:58.360 --> 02:30:02.400
It's not bad for 10 bucks, definitely worth the money.

02:30:02.400 --> 02:30:03.840
Might have to look into that.

02:30:03.840 --> 02:30:05.920
What else have you been playing, anything else?

02:30:05.920 --> 02:30:07.320
No, that's about it.

02:30:07.320 --> 02:30:09.480
Trying to save some money.

02:30:09.480 --> 02:30:11.240
Any new stories you want to talk about tonight

02:30:11.240 --> 02:30:12.880
that we talked about on the show?

02:30:12.880 --> 02:30:14.800
Well, I did want to comment on the whole thing

02:30:14.800 --> 02:30:19.680
about the Diablo III going online only,

02:30:19.680 --> 02:30:22.200
and what company aspects of that are.

02:30:22.200 --> 02:30:22.840
Go ahead.

02:30:22.840 --> 02:30:24.120
You're still cutting in and out a little bit.

02:30:24.120 --> 02:30:25.320
I don't know what's going on with the connection,

02:30:25.320 --> 02:30:27.040
but I'll let you get your thought out there.

02:30:27.040 --> 02:30:29.320
I can understand you enough.

02:30:29.320 --> 02:30:32.080
Blizzard knows that everything is possible with code.

02:30:32.080 --> 02:30:34.760
All they need is time.

02:30:34.760 --> 02:30:37.840
Granted, they do have to do something for copy protection,

02:30:37.840 --> 02:30:43.160
but honestly, if they think this is going to stop anything,

02:30:43.160 --> 02:30:45.800
then they really need to go get their coding team

02:30:45.800 --> 02:30:47.600
and re-evaluate who's working for them,

02:30:47.600 --> 02:30:50.520
because whoever told me that this is going to defeat

02:30:50.520 --> 02:30:53.880
online hacking is ridiculous, because it happens.

02:30:53.880 --> 02:30:56.560
Well, the Warcraft right now looks right.

02:30:56.560 --> 02:30:59.040
That's true, but they ban players from World of Warcraft

02:30:59.040 --> 02:31:00.440
left and right, too, right?

02:31:00.440 --> 02:31:02.800
Yeah, but that won't keep them from getting back in the game.

02:31:02.800 --> 02:31:03.680
I guess that's true.

02:31:03.680 --> 02:31:04.760
What about StarCraft II?

02:31:04.760 --> 02:31:06.040
What are the issues that that game's having?

02:31:06.040 --> 02:31:07.120
Are they having issues, too?

02:31:07.120 --> 02:31:08.480
I guess, but I guess you don't know.

02:31:08.480 --> 02:31:09.800
Well, they have their own variety of issues.

02:31:09.800 --> 02:31:12.600
It's not so much because there's no real persistence

02:31:12.600 --> 02:31:14.520
in the game, other than you think,

02:31:14.520 --> 02:31:17.080
but you'll see people do lag hacks and stuff

02:31:17.080 --> 02:31:19.720
to interfere with the other player's game.

02:31:19.720 --> 02:31:21.280
Remove the fog of wars, you can see

02:31:21.280 --> 02:31:23.680
what your player is doing without having you nearby.

02:31:23.680 --> 02:31:26.320
More gameplay hacks more than anything else.

02:31:26.320 --> 02:31:28.760
And it's even more critical to the play of the game,

02:31:28.760 --> 02:31:31.920
so it does more damage.

02:31:31.920 --> 02:31:35.880
I am very curious to see just how legally this all plays out,

02:31:35.880 --> 02:31:37.960
especially when the first exploit does come down

02:31:37.960 --> 02:31:40.200
the hill, and then suddenly it's impacting the real money

02:31:40.200 --> 02:31:41.120
trading house.

02:31:41.120 --> 02:31:42.960
They've got to be thinking of something.

02:31:42.960 --> 02:31:45.360
There's got to be something in place they're doing.

02:31:45.360 --> 02:31:47.040
I mean, they're swearing up and down

02:31:47.040 --> 02:31:49.160
that they've looked at it from a legal perspective,

02:31:49.160 --> 02:31:52.200
but just because it's totally legal right now, too,

02:31:52.200 --> 02:31:54.880
doesn't mean it will always be legal.

02:31:54.880 --> 02:31:56.560
That's the other thing I kind of worry about with them.

02:31:56.560 --> 02:31:58.800
Especially when they have, the main thing

02:31:58.800 --> 02:32:00.880
is between Second Life and this.

02:32:00.880 --> 02:32:04.000
Second Life, people are making the assets themselves.

02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:06.320
The game isn't supplying them with the assets.

02:32:06.320 --> 02:32:07.840
If you supply them with the assets,

02:32:07.840 --> 02:32:09.880
technically Blizzard still owns them.

02:32:09.880 --> 02:32:12.640
At Second Life, you have rights to whatever you create.

02:32:14.200 --> 02:32:16.320
That's interesting, you're just kind of paying.

02:32:16.320 --> 02:32:18.840
It's going to be very, very strange what happens with it,

02:32:18.840 --> 02:32:20.580
but we'll see what happens once the politicians

02:32:20.580 --> 02:32:21.920
pull their heads out their asses.

02:32:21.920 --> 02:32:24.040
Blizzard is going to be printing money with this.

02:32:24.040 --> 02:32:24.880
It's going to be very interesting.

02:32:24.880 --> 02:32:26.160
All right, Xenocore, I got to let you go.

02:32:26.160 --> 02:32:28.880
Skype's acting up, so take care, buddy, okay?

02:32:28.880 --> 02:32:29.720
All right, later, man.

02:32:29.720 --> 02:32:30.880
Have a good one.

02:32:30.880 --> 02:32:33.280
All right, thank you, listeners.

02:32:33.280 --> 02:32:34.540
I wanted to hear his thoughts on that,

02:32:34.540 --> 02:32:35.640
and I know he's cutting in and out.

02:32:35.640 --> 02:32:36.460
It's probably a little annoying,

02:32:36.460 --> 02:32:37.300
but I wanted to hear what,

02:32:37.300 --> 02:32:38.720
I was able to understand most of it.

02:32:38.720 --> 02:32:39.640
Let me go back to Twitter,

02:32:39.640 --> 02:32:40.640
because I got to get through some more

02:32:40.640 --> 02:32:41.700
of these Twitter topics here,

02:32:41.700 --> 02:32:43.080
and then I'll see if any more calls

02:32:43.080 --> 02:32:44.480
are coming in at that point.

02:32:45.560 --> 02:32:49.640
More Twitter topics at twitter.com slash O-L-R

02:32:49.640 --> 02:32:51.080
as I load them up here.

02:32:51.080 --> 02:32:54.240
Let's see, we actually don't have a whole lot tonight.

02:32:54.240 --> 02:32:55.640
Let me go to,

02:32:57.880 --> 02:32:58.900
Retertainment says,

02:32:58.900 --> 02:33:00.040
I meant to email you,

02:33:00.040 --> 02:33:03.160
but can you warn people that deep vein thrombosis

02:33:03.160 --> 02:33:04.400
is serious.

02:33:04.400 --> 02:33:07.360
Get up and walk around about every two hours.

02:33:07.360 --> 02:33:10.360
Yeah, when they say take a break

02:33:10.360 --> 02:33:11.600
during a long gaming session,

02:33:11.600 --> 02:33:12.440
they're not kidding.

02:33:12.440 --> 02:33:13.680
You really should get up and take a break.

02:33:13.680 --> 02:33:15.120
Even when we raid in WoW,

02:33:15.120 --> 02:33:17.440
we take a quote unquote bio break

02:33:17.440 --> 02:33:19.600
every couple hours for a few minutes.

02:33:19.600 --> 02:33:21.380
You know, that's a chance for folks to get up,

02:33:21.380 --> 02:33:23.960
get water, stay hydrated, get a snack,

02:33:23.960 --> 02:33:25.400
go to the restroom and so forth.

02:33:25.400 --> 02:33:26.240
It's just good practice.

02:33:26.240 --> 02:33:28.920
Well yeah, that guy sat down I think for 12 hours.

02:33:28.920 --> 02:33:31.680
Are we talking about the guy in overseas

02:33:31.680 --> 02:33:32.840
that like died or whatever?

02:33:32.840 --> 02:33:33.680
Yeah.

02:33:34.920 --> 02:33:37.040
Yeah, what was that all about?

02:33:37.040 --> 02:33:39.160
12 hour gaming session.

02:33:39.160 --> 02:33:40.120
It'll kill ya.

02:33:44.040 --> 02:33:47.160
Alright, moving on to more tweets at twitter.com slash O-L-R.

02:33:47.160 --> 02:33:50.360
A couple from Tiger Claw back to back here.

02:33:50.360 --> 02:33:55.360
North Korea's Kim Jong Il is running MMO gold farming racket

02:33:55.440 --> 02:33:57.320
is the tweet that's sent here.

02:33:57.320 --> 02:33:59.360
This is a news story from Game Informer

02:33:59.360 --> 02:34:01.200
delivered to us from Tiger Claw.

02:34:01.200 --> 02:34:03.900
The New York Times is reporting that North Korea

02:34:03.900 --> 02:34:06.100
is using a team of hackers to infiltrate

02:34:06.100 --> 02:34:10.200
popular South Korean MMORPGs and farm in-game points.

02:34:10.200 --> 02:34:12.220
Specially trained North Korean hackers

02:34:12.220 --> 02:34:16.380
working in concert with South Korean and Chinese operatives

02:34:16.380 --> 02:34:19.480
have been infiltrating popular MMOs like Lineage

02:34:19.480 --> 02:34:21.000
accumulating in-game points,

02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:23.260
selling them on the internet black market.

02:34:24.100 --> 02:34:25.780
Wow, the Times say that they've earned

02:34:25.780 --> 02:34:27.740
over six million dollars for their efforts,

02:34:27.740 --> 02:34:29.240
over half of which has been delivered

02:34:29.240 --> 02:34:32.120
to North Korean agents in the capital of Pyongyang.

02:34:33.040 --> 02:34:35.960
Yeah, so please don't support this stuff

02:34:35.960 --> 02:34:38.260
because that's just, I mean, look.

02:34:39.720 --> 02:34:41.400
People are gonna do whatever they have to do to make money.

02:34:41.400 --> 02:34:43.160
That's fine, but when you support it,

02:34:43.160 --> 02:34:46.480
like you're supporting devious tactics like hacking,

02:34:46.480 --> 02:34:49.180
like credit card information getting stolen and so forth,

02:34:49.180 --> 02:34:51.520
it's all going to ruin your gameplay experience.

02:34:51.520 --> 02:34:54.040
And that's why now ultimately Diablo 3

02:34:54.040 --> 02:34:57.120
is gonna require an internet connection, right?

02:34:58.880 --> 02:35:00.760
Tiger Claw also links us to this story

02:35:00.760 --> 02:35:03.160
and usually I let people only have two stories,

02:35:03.160 --> 02:35:06.440
but I gotta say, this one is of definite relevant interest

02:35:06.440 --> 02:35:09.000
to at least one person here in studio.

02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:12.360
Tiger Claw tweets us about Ragnarok Online.

02:35:12.360 --> 02:35:13.720
Yay.

02:35:13.720 --> 02:35:16.560
Has launched an iOS companion game

02:35:16.560 --> 02:35:20.560
for its popular MMORPG, now out in its ninth year.

02:35:20.560 --> 02:35:24.580
Ragnarok Violet is a single-player experience

02:35:24.580 --> 02:35:26.720
that utilizes many of the same functions,

02:35:26.720 --> 02:35:30.340
mechanics, and environments as the original.

02:35:30.340 --> 02:35:32.840
So it's kind of like, I guess, a spinoff mobile game

02:35:32.840 --> 02:35:34.460
that lets you have a single-player experience

02:35:34.460 --> 02:35:35.300
of Ragnarok.

02:35:35.300 --> 02:35:36.960
What does it say in America?

02:35:36.960 --> 02:35:40.760
It does not say, oh no, it looks like it is in US.

02:35:40.760 --> 02:35:42.480
You can read the description on the App Store

02:35:42.480 --> 02:35:45.280
and I click on it and it takes me to the US App Store

02:35:45.280 --> 02:35:46.600
for Ragnarok Violet.

02:35:46.600 --> 02:35:47.440
I'm looking up, looking for it.

02:35:47.440 --> 02:35:49.640
I didn't even get that sentence out of my mouth

02:35:49.640 --> 02:35:52.300
and Dark Sakura, I heard the click on the iPhone.

02:35:54.360 --> 02:35:55.200
Shut up.

02:35:55.200 --> 02:35:56.020
It's free.

02:35:56.880 --> 02:35:58.360
But, oh, there's in-game items,

02:35:58.360 --> 02:36:01.240
like you can get pet eggs and all this crap.

02:36:01.240 --> 02:36:02.640
It's like a free thing.

02:36:03.960 --> 02:36:05.560
Way to go, Tiger Claw.

02:36:05.560 --> 02:36:08.280
We just lost Dark Sakura to Ragnarok all over again.

02:36:08.280 --> 02:36:10.280
Thanks, Tiger Claw.

02:36:10.280 --> 02:36:12.120
Yeah, but the one problem is that if it works

02:36:12.120 --> 02:36:16.040
with my IRO account and I'm not playing IRO anymore,

02:36:16.040 --> 02:36:17.640
then I might be kind of SOL.

02:36:17.640 --> 02:36:20.120
Dark Tetsuya in our chat reminds us about a birthday

02:36:20.120 --> 02:36:22.080
that happened saying, yesterday there was a birthday

02:36:22.080 --> 02:36:24.500
that harkens back to our music game roots.

02:36:24.500 --> 02:36:27.800
Taku Sakiyakiabra, I probably mispronounced that name

02:36:27.800 --> 02:36:30.160
really horribly, turned another year older.

02:36:30.160 --> 02:36:33.460
But you guys all know Taku or T-A-Q, not Taco,

02:36:33.460 --> 02:36:36.400
but Taku, turned a year older.

02:36:36.400 --> 02:36:38.160
How old does that make him?

02:36:38.160 --> 02:36:38.980
I don't know.

02:36:38.980 --> 02:36:39.820
A year older.

02:36:39.820 --> 02:36:40.760
A year older.

02:36:40.760 --> 02:36:42.000
But here you go, guys.

02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:44.020
Enjoy some Birthday Holic.

02:36:44.020 --> 02:36:49.020
There you go, Birthday Holic for Taku.

02:36:49.680 --> 02:36:52.080
All right, let's go to Black Lab.

02:36:52.080 --> 02:36:52.920
Remember him?

02:36:52.920 --> 02:36:55.920
He used to come to this show like years and years ago,

02:36:55.920 --> 02:36:58.120
like in the first 100 episodes or so.

02:36:58.120 --> 02:37:00.800
He's listening tonight and sends his tweets

02:37:00.800 --> 02:37:02.080
and has some Twitter questions.

02:37:02.080 --> 02:37:05.280
Number one, will there be a drunk show soon?

02:37:05.280 --> 02:37:06.120
Probably not.

02:37:06.120 --> 02:37:07.300
I gave up drinking.

02:37:08.600 --> 02:37:09.440
Probably not.

02:37:09.440 --> 02:37:10.840
Not that old.

02:37:10.840 --> 02:37:13.680
Question two, does Jamie still have that copy

02:37:13.680 --> 02:37:15.080
of Owen Don that I gave her?

02:37:15.080 --> 02:37:16.080
Happy face.

02:37:16.080 --> 02:37:18.640
Yes, it's actually in my DS case right now.

02:37:18.640 --> 02:37:20.560
Actually, I think it's in my DS right now.

02:37:20.560 --> 02:37:21.920
And you should say if he wants it back,

02:37:21.920 --> 02:37:24.020
he has to come be on the show again.

02:37:24.020 --> 02:37:25.760
He gave it to me.

02:37:25.760 --> 02:37:26.600
Oh, he gave, oh, I thought it was like-

02:37:26.600 --> 02:37:28.600
Actually, I think I paid him for it.

02:37:28.600 --> 02:37:30.000
Oh, I sound like a, oh, I thought,

02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:31.560
the way it was phrased, it sounded like a loner

02:37:31.560 --> 02:37:32.840
or something like that.

02:37:32.840 --> 02:37:33.680
Oh well.

02:37:33.680 --> 02:37:36.120
Also, another last minute question from Black Lab.

02:37:36.120 --> 02:37:38.160
How to get a Nintendo fan girl

02:37:38.160 --> 02:37:41.680
to try playing non-Zelda games?

02:37:41.680 --> 02:37:44.880
Well, if she's not playing non-Zelda games,

02:37:44.880 --> 02:37:48.680
then she's not much of a fangirl, is she, of Nintendo.

02:37:48.680 --> 02:37:51.660
Dark Sakura, I don't know, you're the girl.

02:37:51.660 --> 02:37:52.960
How do you convince other girls

02:37:52.960 --> 02:37:54.560
to play games that aren't Zelda?

02:37:55.800 --> 02:37:58.800
Pass over your DS and say, here, give this a go.

02:37:58.800 --> 02:38:01.000
What if they say, no, I'm too busy.

02:38:02.400 --> 02:38:03.520
Busy doing what?

02:38:03.520 --> 02:38:04.440
My hair.

02:38:05.320 --> 02:38:06.200
Oh, well, that's important.

02:38:06.200 --> 02:38:08.240
Baking a pie.

02:38:08.240 --> 02:38:09.280
As long as they share the pie.

02:38:09.280 --> 02:38:11.720
Doing my application for the tester.

02:38:11.720 --> 02:38:12.880
I already did that.

02:38:15.040 --> 02:38:16.680
There's always time for games.

02:38:19.280 --> 02:38:20.640
I'm updating my echo phone.

02:38:20.640 --> 02:38:24.160
Find something where there's like a Barbie mode

02:38:24.160 --> 02:38:26.320
where you can do dress up or customization

02:38:26.320 --> 02:38:27.480
because women like that shit.

02:38:27.480 --> 02:38:30.200
No, you wanna know what's funny is that,

02:38:32.600 --> 02:38:35.080
I seriously think that wrestling games,

02:38:35.080 --> 02:38:38.440
those WWF games or whatever, WBE games,

02:38:38.440 --> 02:38:43.000
are like dress up dolls for dudes.

02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:44.760
Because seriously, you can change your outfit.

02:38:44.760 --> 02:38:48.240
I've seen Dan spend hours making wrestlers.

02:38:48.240 --> 02:38:49.720
It's freaking hilarious.

02:38:51.200 --> 02:38:52.040
All right.

02:38:52.040 --> 02:38:54.040
Oh, and also changing the bikinis out

02:38:54.040 --> 02:38:56.020
on Dead or Alive volleyball.

02:38:57.620 --> 02:38:58.920
All right, that's gonna do it

02:38:58.920 --> 02:39:01.340
for the Twitter tonight and the Skype line.

02:39:01.340 --> 02:39:03.400
Thank you guys so much for your tweets and your calls.

02:39:03.400 --> 02:39:04.980
If you didn't get through tonight,

02:39:04.980 --> 02:39:05.820
send us an email.

02:39:05.820 --> 02:39:07.700
Mailbag at orangelongerator.com

02:39:07.700 --> 02:39:10.920
or send us a tweet for next week at twitter.com slash O-L-R.

02:39:10.920 --> 02:39:12.320
In the meantime, I'm gonna go over to Loki

02:39:12.320 --> 02:39:14.480
and see if there's any last minute stories tonight.

02:39:14.480 --> 02:39:15.320
I don't think there is.

02:39:15.320 --> 02:39:16.160
I think we got it all, but.

02:39:16.160 --> 02:39:18.320
Yeah, it was really slow.

02:39:18.320 --> 02:39:19.740
Yeah, it was kind of a slow news week,

02:39:19.740 --> 02:39:21.360
hence why it's kind of a shorter show tonight.

02:39:21.360 --> 02:39:23.760
But they can't always be action packed weeks,

02:39:23.760 --> 02:39:25.120
especially as we get closer and closer.

02:39:25.120 --> 02:39:26.720
Once we get after Labor Day,

02:39:26.720 --> 02:39:28.160
it's just gonna be go, go, go, go, go

02:39:28.160 --> 02:39:29.040
till the end of the year.

02:39:29.040 --> 02:39:30.920
So we'll see.

02:39:30.920 --> 02:39:33.100
All right, well, that means we're coming to the close

02:39:33.100 --> 02:39:34.740
of another episode of Orange Launch Radio.

02:39:34.740 --> 02:39:37.520
And I want to thank all you guys for listening this week.

02:39:37.520 --> 02:39:39.720

02:39:43.560 --> 02:39:44.840
Word of mouth is all we have.

02:39:44.840 --> 02:39:46.460
We don't even ask for money.

02:39:46.460 --> 02:39:48.880

02:39:48.880 --> 02:39:50.280

02:39:50.280 --> 02:39:51.440
We don't even ask for your money.

02:39:51.440 --> 02:39:53.160
All we ask is spread the word,

02:39:53.160 --> 02:39:54.840
leave us a nice review on iTunes

02:39:54.840 --> 02:39:57.780
or whatever podcasting site you use to find this show.

02:39:57.780 --> 02:39:58.840
We'd really appreciate it.

02:39:58.840 --> 02:40:00.640
It goes a long way to help promote the show.

02:40:00.640 --> 02:40:03.840
So thank you guys again for continuing to support the show

02:40:03.840 --> 02:40:04.660
week after week.

02:40:04.660 --> 02:40:06.780
Showing up on Sunday nights, those of you that can

02:40:06.780 --> 02:40:07.640
and so on.

02:40:07.640 --> 02:40:09.760
It makes it all worthwhile to be here again.

02:40:09.760 --> 02:40:12.520
And for Dark Sakura to make an audition tape

02:40:12.520 --> 02:40:15.600
that you all can vote on soon for this show

02:40:15.600 --> 02:40:17.520
that I can't believe she's actually going to go on.

02:40:17.520 --> 02:40:19.760
Let me just check all of my Sony stuff behind me.

02:40:19.760 --> 02:40:22.280
Go look at this shit.

02:40:22.280 --> 02:40:23.200
You owe me.

02:40:24.680 --> 02:40:26.320
All right, let's go around

02:40:26.320 --> 02:40:28.720
and get everybody's final thought tonight.

02:40:28.720 --> 02:40:29.800
Loki, we'll start with you.

02:40:29.800 --> 02:40:31.640
The cheating cheater of Tiny Tower,

02:40:31.640 --> 02:40:35.560
the hacker who has five million Tower bucks

02:40:35.560 --> 02:40:36.940
that he did not purchase.

02:40:37.880 --> 02:40:40.740
And it's basically infinite because it's not going down.

02:40:41.640 --> 02:40:43.080
What's your final thought tonight?

02:40:43.080 --> 02:40:45.460
My final thought is I have 13 floors already.

02:40:47.880 --> 02:40:50.360
Dark Sakura, what's your final thought tonight?

02:40:50.360 --> 02:40:51.260
Hire me.

02:40:52.400 --> 02:40:57.080
And my final thought tonight is tacos.

02:40:57.080 --> 02:40:58.360
That's going to do it for another week

02:40:58.360 --> 02:40:59.640
here at Orange Launch Radio.

02:40:59.640 --> 02:41:00.960
Thanks again for tuning in.

02:41:00.960 --> 02:41:03.480
We will be back to do it all again next week.

02:41:03.480 --> 02:41:04.760
So we'll see you then.

02:41:04.760 --> 02:41:06.160
Have a good night, everybody.

02:41:07.840 --> 02:41:11.080
