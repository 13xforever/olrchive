0	20720	Tonight, August 21st, 2011, the PlayStation 3 price is cut, the Vita promises to deliver
20720	26560	many popular social apps, and are Japanese retailers losing interest in the Xbox 360?
26560	35260	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show
35260	41320	where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio. We are live on this Sunday, August
41320	45840	21st of 2011. My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you over the next few hours
45840	50260	to talk about video games, gamer lifestyle, gaming culture, and all that fun stuff with
50260	53360	my co-host, the one, the only, Dark Sakura, Jamie Sommers.
53360	54360	Filodo.
54360	55360	What?
55360	56360	Filodo.
56360	61280	I am. Well, it's kind of, it's Greek. I'm having spinach pie.
61280	62280	Spinach pie.
62280	64240	Like spanakopita, only big.
64240	66120	Okay, it sounds good.
66120	69200	It's Greek. There's plenty.
69200	73240	And say hello, I just know feta cheese, that's Greek too, and the olives, they're really
73240	77960	good. All right, also say hello to, I'm ignorant, say hello to tech master Loki.
77960	81760	What she meant to say is Filodo.
81760	86200	The secret ingredient is Filodo.
86200	91360	Just doing a speaker check, everybody out there. Make sure your levels are Loki appropriate
91360	94280	tonight for him to scream in the microphone. How you doing, Loki?
94280	95280	I'm doing fine.
95280	100040	Awesome. All right. Always present with us, the chat room, the fourth guest on the program,
100040	104480	chat.orangeloungeradio.com. If you want to join us on this Sunday night with us as we
104480	110880	are taping episode number 425 of our show live. So, um, I don't know about you guys,
110880	115520	I've had a pretty busy day. I was on another podcast this morning for a good, God, it probably
115520	118120	went for about two, two and a half hours, but it was a good show.
118120	119120	Was it fun?
119120	122840	It was fun. I was hanging with my sassy British friends on the girls gone wow podcast, which
122840	127320	I know is funny because I'm not a girl, but, uh, it doesn't matter. It's still a good time.
127320	130520	And, uh, the girls that are on the show are very fun.
130520	132960	They took my suggestion and called you Sky and called him Rob.
132960	137040	Yes, they did. They did. I didn't know that was your suggestion. Good for you. So anyway,
137040	141280	I was doing that this morning, so a cheap plug for them. That works. And, um, yeah.
141280	144800	Uh, before we get into gaming weeks, I want to talk about this because this is something
144800	149640	I was kind of doing this weekend as well. And, um, so I haven't mentioned this on Twitter
149640	152440	and I haven't really talked about this anywhere because I wanted to just kind of start off
152440	156560	the nice show talking about this, but, um, I did something to one of my consoles that
156560	162560	I haven't done in a very long time since maybe the PlayStation one. And that is my Nintendo
162560	168880	Wii. Um, I hacked it. I loaded up the homebrew channel on it and all the other fun stuff,
168880	174440	uh, that you can do with it. The, like the, uh, loader and all that stuff. And, uh, yeah,
174440	178200	I did it. And you might be thinking like, well, okay, Rob, why did you do that? And
178200	183160	the answer is, well, cause I could, um, I'm going to be totally just blunt and honest.
183160	187720	Um, I read that article on joystick.com. I don't know how many of you guys saw this,
187720	190560	but a joystick ran an article a couple of days ago. You know them, they're a very big
190560	194320	blog gaming blog. They have their own show. It's huge on iTunes. I'm sure many of you
194320	200080	subscribe. Um, there, as far as like the, um, more corporate blogs go, I guess you could
200080	204400	say, they're definitely one of the better ones. Um, and it's because of interesting
204400	209360	things like this that they do that make them stand out. And, uh, they ran an article Thursday
209360	214640	or Friday, uh, about Xenoblade coming out in Europe. And the article was basically how
214640	220400	to play Xenoblade on a US Wii. And it basically was, here is what you need to download. Here
220400	225160	is how you hack your console. And here's where you buy your import copy of Xenoblade so you
225160	229800	can play it on the Wii. And I have to admit a lot of what was holding me back before to
229800	234600	hacking my console was it seemed kind of complicated. Like I know Loki was always doing all that
234600	238320	stuff, but you know, Loki, and we've talked about this on the show before, Loki breaks
238320	242560	shit because he can't. That's, and sometimes I break shit when I don't want to break shit,
242560	248020	but it happens. That's just part of the process, part of it for you. And I've not usually been
248020	252320	of that same mindset, but when I found out, you know, when I was reading that joystick
252320	256640	article, I was like, well, shit, this looks really easy. So, I mean, it looks lengthy,
256640	262760	but it looks easy. So I followed it step by step and I did it. It was, it was pretty easy
262760	266480	and I got to admit it was kind of neat seeing like all the, uh, you know, cause when you're
266480	270680	doing some of this stuff, you basically are booting your Wii, like it's a PC. And so it
270680	274920	has kind of like that old school IBM PC font and you see all these programs that are running
274920	280520	in that and so forth. So, um, it's Linux loaders. I don't even know what the hell's going on.
280520	284360	I just kind of followed all the instructions and there you go. So now if I want to import
284360	290880	Xenoblade, I can, um, I don't know how I feel about that right now. I really, really do
290880	297160	not like this whole region. I don't like region locking. I don't like the fact that some games
297160	300760	come out in one region and don't come out in the other. I love so much more what Sony
300760	304920	is doing. And maybe I think that was part of my big motivator was that I just wanted
304920	310480	to make my Wii region free and now I can check out some of this other cool shit about, uh,
310480	319040	like what custom Mario Kart Wii and so forth and what you can play president cat. Yes,
319040	323040	I could play president cat. I didn't even think of that, but that's a damn good reason
323040	327120	for me to have done what I did in my way. I could, if there's any game worth importing,
327120	332600	it's that one. If I could even find a copy anymore, I have a copy. Really? Yeah. I would
332600	337280	like to borrow president cat. I bought a copy of present cat, played it once and it sits
337280	342600	in the shelf somewhere. I knew there was a good reason I did this. Uh, and I, I realized
342600	346880	some folks out there that are very anti hacking and all that are like, Rob, how could you,
346880	350080	you've been the voice of reason on the show for so long. How could you do this? Well,
350080	354880	if you want to know how he could do it, the instructions were on joystick at the end of
354880	361160	the day. Yes, that's exactly right. Somebody wrote an article like how to do this for dummies
361160	366400	and I was like, all right, I can do it. And I did it. And in some ways I realized I was
366400	370120	taking a risk with my Wii console that, you know, I might break it or something like that.
370120	377200	Uh, and um, uh, I said, well, the Wii is pretty much a dead system to me right now. Like maybe
377200	381560	I'll play that new Zelda game, but that's about it. Uh, I otherwise am not afraid of
381560	387720	breaking my console if I break it. Oh, Wells. I wasn't really playing it anyway. Um, so I did it.
387720	394800	Um, and that's, that's that. You're such a naughty boy. Well, I didn't, I didn't go crazy on bit
394800	400160	torn or anything like that. That was not my motivation for hacking the Wii. Um, you know,
400160	406880	so I want to make that clear. Um, I think it's interesting that I could use the USB loader to
406880	411760	like load up my games onto one drive, but I don't know. I don't know if I'll really do that because
411760	416160	I honestly think it's just easier to just get the damn disc and put it in the Wii if I'm actually
416160	421520	going to play any of those games. Let's face it. Many of which I don't anymore. Once in a blue,
421520	426160	blue moon, I'll decide there's something on the Wii I want to play. Usually it's a virtual console
426160	433720	game, to be honest. Um, so there you go. Loki, what do you think of, uh, now I, now I could ask
433720	440200	this question. What do you think of the fact that a big blog like joystick did this? Because clearly
440200	443840	they did it to make a statement. Like at least that's what I read out of it. They did it to make
443840	450280	a statement that Nintendo by not releasing Xena blade in the U S we, you leave us no other choice.
450280	454760	I think they've run an article similar to that before anyways. And I know they've done it before
454760	462680	with the PSP. So yeah, I'm not surprised. Hmm. What do you think dark soccer? What do you think
462680	467440	of a website like that? Kind of a, you know, a prestigious, if we will gaming website. They're
467440	471200	kind of doing that. They're going to get a cease and desist from Nintendo and then take the article
471200	476800	down. But the damage has been done. Their protest has been made. Do you think that they made a
476800	481560	statement or do you think that they look kind of, you know, and I'm not, I'm not asking this to,
481560	487480	to open any channel of disrespecting what they did, but let's see statemently to me, you know,
487480	494120	yeah, I think they did. I'm well done. So now here's the other interesting thing about this
494120	500240	whole Xena blade and the last story in this whole saga, my gut still tells me we've got packs coming
500240	505120	this weekend and there's going to be a lot of news that comes out of packs. I think that usually you
505120	510240	don't have a lot of big, big announcements coming out of packs. Like usually that's what E3 is for
510240	516320	games. Calm usually ends up being a pretty similar show to packs. However, packs has been getting
516320	520840	bigger and bigger. It's been a sellout show. I think you do see companies making more and more
520840	527680	announcements. And honestly, in my mind, what better time to announce Xena blade? I honestly
527680	534480	think if Nintendo does not announce Xena blade at packs next week, they're not going to. I think
534480	538360	next week is really the last quote unquote last chance. I mean, granted, they can hold a press
538360	543520	conference whenever they want and say whatever they want. But as far as a celebration, if you
543520	549320	will, of the fans, next week is the chance for them to do that. Nintendo is in Seattle. They're
549320	553440	in the backyard of Seattle. It's not a problem for them to do packs and they do go I think every
553440	557000	year. Yeah, I think so. Someone in the chat correct me if they're not going this year, but I'm
557000	561920	pretty sure they are. And I would openly question if they're taking the Wii U. I know a lot of
561920	567000	people are assuming that because the Wii U is at E3, that it's going to be at packs. I'm not so
567000	571560	sure that if Nintendo is doing packs, which I still need someone to confirm because I might be
571560	576240	wrong. I'm not so sure if Nintendo is doing packs that they're going to bring the Wii U. And the
576240	583440	reason why is that the Wii U did not get a huge reception at E3. And so they might have taken
583440	587800	things back to the drawing board. They may not be ready to show that to the public. If Nintendo is
587800	592480	going to E3 or excuse me, if Nintendo is going to packs, they're going to be showing off the 3DS.
592480	597080	That's for sure. That'll be their huge thing. Their huge push will be the Mario game, the Mario
597080	603840	Kart, and the 3DS price cut. That is going to be the majority of what they're pushing. But they do
603840	609200	have a handful of titles coming out on the Wii this holiday season, like Rhythm Heaven. There's
609200	614040	another Kirby game, right? It's on its way. So there's a few things that Nintendo kind of still
614040	619240	has going on. And what a perfect time for them to say, oh yeah, and over here on these kiosks we
619240	623800	have, hey, American Xenoblade. I really think the push is going to be more of the 3DS obviously
623800	628040	because they just dropped the system down in price. They've really kicked up the advertising
628040	632760	for it. I don't know if you've seen the ads about, you know, basically highlighting the three big
632760	642320	games from Star Fox, Mario, Mario Kart. You know, so they're definitely pushing. So going to the
642320	647400	chatroom at chat.orangelaungeradio.com, Black Wolf is in chat saying Nintendo won't bring the Wii U
647400	652000	because they only showed it to E3 to stop leaks. And see, I'm kind of inclined to agree is that
652000	656760	maybe not totally the reason why. I think part of the reason why, I think if the Wii U had had a
656760	662120	huge, oh my gosh, everybody's got to do this, and all this whole huge reception at E3, I think they
662120	667360	would have had a little bit of it at PAX. But also keep in mind that the PAX boosts are a lot smaller
667360	672720	than the E3 boosts. And they don't always have as much space to show everything. And if they were to
672720	678320	bring the Wii U, they would have those huge lines that go with it. I just don't think now is the
678320	683600	time for them to be pushing the Wii U. Next year's PAX? Maybe, because we could be looking at the Wii
683600	690200	U for next holiday. But I just think this year's PAX is going to be all about the 3DS. And maybe,
690320	693720	just maybe, Xenoblade. So...
693720	696920	I'm actually entirely inclined to agree with that.
698000	702360	And sg100mad is confirming for me that Nintendo is going to be at PAX. Thank you very much.
702680	707920	UnfoldedRaptor is in our chatroom saying, Sky, the last story, another big RPG for the Wii is getting
707920	712800	localized for Europe, but not for America. I think we'll see this whole situation again in the future.
712800	714360	Oh, absolutely. Absolutely.
714840	719200	Well, this is the last story is still part of that. Whatever that campaign. Yeah.
719200	722880	But otherwise, the games actually do. I mean, they're both RPGs, but that's kind of where the
722880	727680	similarities end. The huge thing about the last story is it's Mistwalker. Meaning like, Nobei
727680	732920	Uematsu did the music. The guy that did the Final Fantasy, the original, is behind this. I mean,
732920	738720	Mistwalker games are usually a pretty big deal. Of course, well, I guess I say that with a grain of salt.
738720	742520	Maybe they're a big deal in Japan. Like, Blue Dragon, I don't think was so well received here.
743520	750560	Lost Odyssey was horrifically underrated. I think that's one of the greatest 360 games as far as RPGs
750560	755840	go, and just kind of landed here with a resounding no one curr, which is really sad. So I'm really
755840	764880	excited to see kind of what they did with the Wii. So let's see. Going to other comments, Unfolded
764880	769040	Raptor is saying Pandora's Tower is also set to get a localization for Europe next year, and that's
769040	775360	the third game. SSG100Matt in chat says, Rob, the funny thing is that not only Nintendo will be
775360	783640	there, but the editors for Joystick will be there. Cat fight? I don't know. Gang fight? I don't know.
783640	789720	You know, I'm not, like, you know, our little dog and pony podcast does not get quite the amount of
789720	795760	viewers that Joystick does, so I'm not sure what kind of happens when you're that big, if you can
795760	799360	get away with more things like that without getting blacklisted or what have you. But I do
799360	804880	seem to remember some time ago, Kotaku did something to piss Sony off, you know, and they're
804880	809160	another big blog, and they got blacklisted for a little while, but it was, well, when I say a little
809160	813920	while, it was literally, like, 48 hours or something. Something was quickly remedied there, so, you
813920	819120	know, a blog that big has a lot of pull, I gotta say. So I don't think Nintendo could just straight
819120	825960	up blacklist them, but, you know, there's things Nintendo could do if they want, so. They could
825960	830680	stomp their little foot and pout. Black Wolf is being a party pooper, saying the last story
830680	835160	soundtrack actually was done by Yoshitaka Suzuki. It was not done by Nobui Matsu. He didn't even do
835160	839400	the theme or anything? That's surprising to me, because he's a part of Mistwalker Studios, so, hmm,
839400	844680	whatever. Let's see. We're gonna get into How Was Your Gaming Week here in just a minute, but let me
844680	851080	go to another kind of random question that popped up in chat from Dhanesh. Hey guys, Mr. Nesh here.
851080	855520	I have a question for OLR. From what information you know at this moment, would you guys buy the
855520	864560	3DS now, or wait for the PlayStation Vita if you could only buy one? Hmm. I already own a 3DS, but
864560	870000	see, I'm in the, see, here's where I'm at, is that I kind of think the systems are spaced far enough
870000	876960	apart, or that if you plan well, you can kind of afford both. I agree. So, but if you're very adamant,
876960	880880	like, no, I only have X amount, and I understand there's students and people on fixed budgets that,
880880	887080	you know, can only afford one or the other, it's really hard right now for me to say, yeah, go for
887080	892520	the Vita, because for the Vita right now, we have a lot of announcements, and we have a lot of, you
892520	897440	know, ideas for games, but now that the Vita is not launching till 2012, there's a part of me that
897440	902960	wonders if it's not gonna have a very similar situation to what the 3DS had, meaning, yeah, it's
902960	906840	gonna launch in March, but there's not gonna be any really good launch games, and then everything
906840	912760	you really want will be out at the holidays. So part of me says, if you think you could have enough
912760	917920	money this holiday, and then again next holiday, I think you're safe to get a 3DS right now, and
917920	922720	then get a Vita later. Otherwise, it really depends on what games you want to play, because if you
922720	927440	want to play Uncharted, 3DS doesn't have anything like that right now, so clearly you need to get a
927440	931840	Vita, but if you want to play Mario, the Vita doesn't have anything like that right now, so you
931840	937320	need to get a 3DS. So I don't have an easy answer. It really depends on what games do you want to
937320	940680	play, because that's the only thing that's setting the two systems apart right now. If you think
940680	946360	about it this way, the two systems don't have any games in common. It's not like the Xbox and the
946360	953360	360. All right, herp derp. The 360 and the PlayStation 3. Incorrect. Okay, what do they have in common?
953360	958560	They might have some franchises that get one game here and one game here, but what games do
958560	968240	the two both have? Lego Harry Potter years 5 through 7. Well, excuse me! Hey, you said none. I just
968240	977120	pissed off a bunch of Harry Potter Lego fans. My bad on that. I will actually say that if it were
977120	987280	me, I'd get 3DS, because I haven't touched our PSP since I was playing Papa Lacrosse, or no, I was
987280	991800	playing Roko Loco. I was playing some back then, but it was about a year. Here's something else to
991800	997360	consider. Do you need that portable device to do other shit for you? Meaning, do you need an
997360	1002320	mp3 player as well? Do you want something to surf the web with? I mean, granted, the 3DS does have a
1002320	1009600	web browser, but it's kind of shit. Terrible! Where the PSP really succeeded, that the original DS,
1009600	1013840	or DS Lite, whatever you want to call it, kind of didn't do so well, is that, you know, what's
1013840	1018440	PlayStation's little tagline? It only does everything. Well, that's kind of true when it comes
1018440	1023880	to PSP versus DS, you know, going back. And what I imagine will continue to be the case in Vita
1023880	1029480	versus 3DS is that the PS Vita is going to be able to do this other stuff. We have a story later on
1029480	1035000	tonight about apps that you know from the iPhone are going to be making their way to the Vita. If
1035000	1039520	you don't have an iPhone, so maybe you have a need for this kind of stuff, then the Vita looks more
1039520	1044880	appealing. But if you don't need any of that crap, you don't need Facebook, again, because maybe you
1044880	1051080	have an Android or something, then maybe you're fine with the 3DS. So I know you want me to say
1051080	1055680	one or the other, but every gamer is different. And it's really about, at the end of the day,
1055680	1060720	what's the golden rule of gaming? A system is only as good as the games that are on it. And only you
1060720	1065520	know what games you want to play. So speaking of games you want to play, let's talk about our gaming
1065520	1069800	weeks. And we usually like to start off the show talking about what video games we have been playing.
1069800	1077680	SnarkSakura, start us off. Games I have been and am playing right now? Sims 3. I've got everything
1077680	1085240	up, except for the newest expansion. And I am playing the crap out of it. And then I have been
1085240	1090240	playing World of Warcraft. And I actually got really burned out last night. Like, I could not,
1090240	1096080	I played for like five hours. Because I was just sitting here going, buh, buh, buh. I'm gonna play
1096080	1101480	my paladin. It takes so long to level when you're in the 70s now. I mean, it's faster than it was
1101480	1106680	with my mage. Because, hi, everything there is undead, and hi, paladin holy, whatever. So I've
1106680	1113400	been playing a bunch of that. And I've actually played Robot Unicorn Attack for a little bit today.
1113400	1119640	In Tiny Tower. That's it. Alright. Loki, what have you been up to? You're playing something right now
1119640	1123480	during the show. What is this that you're checking out right now? I'm playing Earth Defense Force
1123480	1127880	Insect Arm again. The minute you paused it and it said destroy the anthill, I'm like, oh, this must
1127880	1132840	be Earth Defense Force. Yes. I actually have been playing a lot of Earth Defense Force this week. My
1132840	1137240	boss is out of town. Normally he wants to play Grand Theft Auto during our breaks and lunch and
1137240	1143680	stuff. But since he's gone, and our other co-workers gone, we've only had three people. And so we've
1143680	1150520	been playing Earth Defense Force all week long. And it's been awesome. I've leveled up my tactical
1150520	1157560	guy up to tier seven. Trying to level up to tier eight now by farming this first level. And there's
1157560	1164840	a trick to it, and it also involves a rubber band. Kind of a cheat, I guess. So I will be doing that
1164840	1171080	during the show because- You haven't cheated anything ever. It's an exploit. It's not necessarily a cheat. I am not,
1171080	1177080	you know, hacking or anything. Even though I could have done that, but I did not. So I am leveling up
1177080	1183960	legitimately. I just don't feel like holding the trigger down for three hours. So that's where the
1183960	1189240	rubber band comes into play. So yeah. That's what I've been doing. You do all the cheating you want in
1189240	1194520	single player mode. You know what? If you want to cheat the hell out of it when you're by yourself,
1194520	1199880	then go for it. It's all co-op. There's no cheating. There's no leaderboards. There's nothing. So it's only
1199880	1208440	for my own benefit. So then the other stuff I've been playing, I played VVVV. And I finished the
1208440	1213160	game, but I still have to get some of the shiny objects in there. And that game was really hard.
1213160	1220840	And, you know, frustratingly hard sometimes. But I think that's the point of it. And it was fun.
1222200	1231160	Let's see what else they play. A little bit of Grand Theft Auto. And I think that's it, actually.
1231160	1238680	Just those three. Yeah, I don't think I played- I may have turned Tiny Tower on once. I actually, I
1238680	1243560	probably should download the update for that. So I'll probably do that. And then maybe build some
1243560	1252280	more empty floors since I can't build anything else. Yeah, that's it. My gaming week. My Xbox is
1252280	1256840	still out of commission. If you haven't heard the story yet, listen to last week's show at the very
1256840	1261000	beginning. So I don't really have any updates on that yet. It's just sitting there collecting dust
1261000	1265560	until that whole debacle's settled down. Because even though I can play things in single player
1265560	1270440	mode, I don't want to get achievements and stuff. So I don't know. I've just moved on to PlayStation
1270440	1275960	3, which is what I've been playing mostly in my console gaming time. Not a lot of new stuff for
1275960	1279800	me to talk about on PlayStation 3. I've been, you know, revisiting some of the old stuff. Played
1279800	1286680	Katamari randomly during the week. And also was playing a game that I think I briefly talked about
1286680	1290840	before, like last year on the show when it first came out. But it's Hardcore Uprising. And if you
1290840	1295000	don't know what this game is, it's basically Contra. But they didn't call it Contra. It's
1295000	1300680	Hardcore Uprising. And the art is all by Arc System Works and all this. Although it's still
1300680	1305240	a Konami game. And yeah, it's something that Extifer of all people got me into. If you guys
1305240	1309640	listen to Hoard House, you know Extifer. And he is really into this game right now. And when we all
1309640	1313880	went over to his house about a week ago, he was playing it and I was kind of watching him and I
1313880	1318280	was like, oh, this actually looks kind of fun. Like I don't remember feeling this awesome about
1318280	1325640	the game after playing the demo. Just because, you know, it's a Contra game. It's really hard. You
1325640	1330040	have some things that you didn't have in the original Contra like a life bar. Not everything
1330040	1334360	instantly kills you. Although there is a lot of stuff that will instantly kill you. And what I
1334360	1340120	really like about Hardcore Uprising is what they call the Uprising Mode. And in the Uprising Mode,
1340120	1345960	you basically, all your points turn out to be a currency. And you use these points to upgrade
1345960	1351000	your characters so that the mode can get a little easier and a little easier. Like maybe you can
1351000	1356520	make your life bar a little bit longer. Or you get yourself a few more lives. Or your power up will
1356520	1362760	be a little bit stronger next time that you get that power up. So I like being able to progress
1362760	1365960	that way because that way it doesn't feel like you keep banging your head against the wall because
1365960	1370120	you keep dying at the same point. You know that as long as you keep racking up points, you'll be
1370120	1373880	able to get your character more and more powered so that you'll be able to get through all that
1373880	1381160	stuff. So yeah, that's the cool thing about Hardcore Uprising. And yeah, if you want the
1381160	1385240	hardcore stuff though, there's Arcade Mode where you don't have any of the power ups and you just
1385240	1390440	got to push through. And I was excited that I could beat the first stage without continuing,
1390440	1395640	okay? Like that was- In the Contra game, that's huge. Yeah, it is huge. I'm sorry. So there you
1395640	1401320	go. And yeah, Zethur's in the chat room going, get all the achievements, try beating it on no
1401320	1408440	death mode. Good luck with that. That's something that what maybe Dan could do, Jamie's husband Dan?
1408440	1414840	If that, he used to be able to do really well on Contra a long time ago, but not so much.
1415560	1418360	I mean, he's just, he's out of practice. It's been a while.
1418360	1425480	Now, Zethur is also clarifying that it's more of a sequel to the game on the Genesis is where
1425480	1427480	that comes from. Contra Hardcore.
1427480	1431960	Yeah, Contra Hardcore. So, all right. I mean, whatever at the end of the day, it's Contra.
1431960	1436360	That's what it feels. You have a spread gun. You have all the metals and just the music.
1436360	1439080	Contra Hardcore was pretty dang hard.
1439080	1445560	Yeah. So, so there you go. That was, that was Hardcore Uprising. And that was pretty much,
1445560	1449720	you know, other than that, some more PC games, more Civilization V because it's great.
1450280	1454760	And of course World of Warcraft. So that was my gaming week. All right. Quickly,
1454760	1459080	some housekeeping before we get into the news tonight. Um, I want to quickly say there is no
1459080	1464840	show next Sunday. I do believe another best of is being prepped for the live folks that listen
1464840	1469400	at all games.com. So at least there will be that, but we will not be live next week. Um,
1469400	1473080	I'm going to be out of town and we're just going to take the week off.
1473080	1474200	I'm helping somebody move.
1474200	1477720	It's been a while since we had a week off. So darn it. Sometimes we take a day off. So,
1477720	1481480	uh, we're taking next week off, but we'll be back in two weeks. It is a little bit of a
1481480	1485720	bummer that we're missing next week because it is PAX, but just the timing of everything,
1486360	1489720	not really going to work out. So my hope is that maybe some of our listeners are going to
1489720	1492920	PAX and they're just not going to be able to tune in because they're flying back or whatever.
1492920	1496600	So we'll do a big roundup and everything. When we come back on Labor Day weekend,
1496600	1501240	we will be having a show. So we'll be seeing you guys then. Otherwise, in the meantime,
1501240	1505480	follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash O L R. We're also on Facebook at facebook.com
1505480	1509240	slash orange lounge radio. And of course there's always our website,
1509240	1515480	www dot orange launch radio.com. There's some forums. Um, I noticed that, uh, we had a post
1515480	1518760	where some of the things that we weren't sure. Remember how last week we had the email that
1518760	1522360	linked to a deviant art account and we weren't sure if we could post the pictures of the Capcom
1522360	1525880	building and all this stuff that we were linked. Well, that email or went and made a post in our
1525880	1529720	forums and was like, Oh, I don't care here at all is. So if you want to kind of like see that
1529720	1533480	second half to last week's email, it's all there on the forums. So check that out. Orange launch
1533480	1539000	radio.com. All right, let's get into tonight's news. Loki start us off. Yes. Um,
1539000	1544280	so start things off. We're gonna talk a little bit about PlayStation and, um,
1545880	1551560	some interesting stuff came out this week from games.com. First thing, uh, which was kind of
1551560	1556280	exciting for people is that they dropped the price by 50 bucks. So the PlayStation three systems,
1556280	1563160	the three twenties dropped down to $300 and the one sixties down to $250. Um,
1563160	1568520	and I'm sure that's just to kind of pick up the pace for the holiday season because I don't think
1568520	1574600	they've been a top dog for the last few months. So they kind of have to, well, I guess try a little
1574600	1580840	harder. So, um, also they're going to be rolling out some new, uh, bundles as well infamous too.
1580840	1585560	I know there's one for uncharted three that's coming out in the fall. They don't think they've
1585560	1591080	announced yet. Um, so that stuff will be in the pipeline. Plus, you know, this is the big holiday
1591080	1597880	where they're pushing their 3d. Um, basically there's themselves as like a 3d platform, uh,
1597880	1604120	with all the new games supporting 3d from them as well as their 3d monitor TV thing,
1604120	1612840	whatever you want to call it. Um, so they've got that as well. Um, it'll help drive sales.
1612840	1619400	That's for sure. Uh, whether, you know, pushes the whole 3d platform. Do you think, do you think
1619400	1623560	3d gaming is really what people want right now? Like, does anyone in the room really want that?
1623560	1628600	Like there's a part of me, which I know is ironic because I own a 3ds, but I'm kind of like, eh,
1628600	1633480	3ds is flashing the pan enough for me. I don't know how I feel about it in my living room. Well,
1633480	1639000	the thing with the 3d right now, I think is it's just too cumbersome. There's, you know, expensive,
1639000	1644360	it's expensive. It's, it's still too new to be affordable for everybody. And even like with,
1644360	1650040	if you buy a 3d TV and stuff, I think it's, it'll be better once it's more of a passive technology,
1650040	1654920	instead of having these active shutter glasses, it costs a hundred bucks each. I mean, you know,
1654920	1659720	it needs to be to the point where it's like, okay, here's some polarized glasses. Like,
1659720	1664360	you know, the crap that you get at the movie theater where that would be, you know, maybe
1664360	1668120	a few bucks a glass, you know, pair of glasses and then it's all right. Then you can invite
1668120	1672760	your friends over. You have plenty of glasses to go around for them to do that kind of stuff.
1672760	1677480	Um, I'm laughing to myself now because speaking of 3d, totally forgot to mention played Ridge
1677480	1685080	racer 3ds this week. Cause I bought it during the Amazon DS 3ds sale last week. Oops. It's
1685080	1690760	awesome. Isn't it? It's actually, it's a really good show off the system kind of game. Like if
1690760	1696040	you want to show off the 3d and shut off some of it's a little gimmicky, like the whole, like,
1696040	1700440	Oh, there's gotta be confetti flying at your face in every race. And it's, it's kind of bootsy
1700440	1706280	because the confetti does not go at like 30 frames a second. It looks really bootsy to me. Uh, and
1706280	1711880	some of the collision is a little dippy. Like it just doesn't control. Like if you run into the
1711880	1716680	wall on accident, then suddenly your car's like turning at these magical angles. If you can look
1716680	1721480	over those little silly flaws that that's been in the game for like, I know, I know why. Cause
1721480	1726120	they don't change the game ever. It's just supported from system. And it's showing, that's
1726120	1730680	what I'm saying. It's showing it's you look at that stuff and you go, come on. We're this, the
1730680	1735640	technology is how far along, but otherwise, you know, the 3d effects are pretty good. Uh, and uh,
1735640	1739720	yeah, I liked it. Sorry. I didn't mean to turn your story into a Ridge Racer 3ds review, but I
1739720	1742760	just forgot to mention that. That's all right. I know the system that Ridge Racer is really awesome
1742760	1749640	on the PSP. Um, if you're late to the game and really want to get into, uh, the last generate,
1749640	1756600	well, soon to be last generation of handhelds from Sony, you can do so for 99 Euro. Um, it's
1756600	1761880	going to be a new PSP model. That's kind of a different look to it. Uh, more of like a sleek
1761880	1767160	black. And um, weren't they all sleek black? Oh wait, no. Well, they were shiny. This is more of
1767160	1775240	like a silver one. This is like a matte finish. Um, and it will not have wifi. It is without
1775240	1782920	wifi. So if you're thinking of playing multiplayer games, uh, not going to happen.
1784840	1791080	Interesting that they cut out the wifi. I mean, you know, surf the web. Nope. That is a pretty
1791080	1795640	big component of the PSP that they, they just kind of chopped out. But at the same time you
1795640	1800680	look at it and go, eh, but it's only 99 euros, which I imagine would mean $99 here. Although
1800680	1805400	had they even had, they even announced it for America. It's not coming to America. It's only
1805400	1810760	in Europe. And why is that? Is that just cause Sony does, does better in Europe? Is this our
1810760	1817560	punishment for rejecting the go? It's it's not, I mean, if you're really looking for a cheap system
1818120	1822600	and then this is the problem with this, once again, they're releasing something
1822600	1828040	that they think is cheap, but it's not. If you're looking for a cheap PSP this late in the game,
1828040	1836280	just buy used. I mean, seriously, you could buy a PSP 1000 for $65. Um, or, and, and that has
1836280	1843880	wifi in it. It has all the features that this has and more for less. I mean, so why would you
1843880	1850040	go and try to buy something brand new for slightly less? And it's really kind of a crippled version
1850040	1856840	of the system. Same thing was like with what the PSP go was. Why would you buy something,
1856840	1862440	you know, more expensive that comes crippled? It doesn't make any sense. No one wants that. So
1865160	1868520	I mean, they might as well make it smaller and call it the PSP micro because that's how it's
1868520	1875640	going to sell. No one's going to want it. Yeah. Why even bother releasing a new PSP anyways?
1875640	1880600	It's just, I think people are already done with the PSP. It's kind of at the end of its life
1880600	1888040	cycle already. Maybe it's kind of their last hurrah for the holiday because the Vita didn't
1888040	1893560	make it. Cause the Vita didn't make it in Europe either. Put out a new 3000 bundle or something
1893560	1897480	like that. They just had one that came out with Madden and need for speed in it or something like
1897480	1905880	that. Uh, in the U S why do we have to, why even bother releasing a new system? Why, why spend the
1905880	1911880	time right now to redesign the system to make it slightly cheaper to put it out anyways? I mean,
1911880	1915720	the only thing I can think of is that they're trying to cash in on, um,
1918440	1922680	on these reduced price games that they have coming out. They have some UMD dual packs.
1922680	1926840	They're coming out for 10 bucks from a bunch of third party companies. And I mean, it's a good
1926840	1932120	deal if you're looking for really cheap games and yes, you can still download stuff off the
1932120	1939000	PlayStation store. If you have a PC or a PlayStation three, you can download it straight off there and
1939000	1944920	you know, put it on a memory stick or something like that. But I, I mean, seriously, just buy
1944920	1951080	you system if you're really going to do that. Um, cause there's, there's no reason to buy this. I
1951080	1956680	mean, seriously, it's just buy you system. Hell, you can probably even find a new system for that
1956680	1965960	price. I mean, if people are sitting on inventory for it. All right. Well, we see how Loki feels
1965960	1971320	about that. Um, I don't know. Uh, I, I do have to admit the idea of a new PSP is a little silly
1971320	1976040	when, yeah, I think Loki makes a damn good argument that if you can get a used one cheaper
1976040	1981320	than this, then why go for this when you're missing wifi? Uh, before he kind of pointed
1981320	1985560	that out, I was thinking, all right, well, it's a way for them to get the system out under a hundred
1985560	1991720	dollars. So it looks really appealing to, you know, maybe, maybe younger folks that kind of
1991720	1995960	want one, but the parents don't want to spend that much money on a toy. You know what I mean?
1996680	2001720	But, Hmm. All right. Well, anyhow, let's talk about the other handheld system and that would
2001720	2007640	be the 3DS as you all I'm sure are aware of the 3DS recently had a huge price cut going on to it.
2007640	2013720	Uh, and that price cut included Japan and in Japan, the price of the device went from 25,000
2013720	2019080	yen down to 15,000 yen. That's a huge price. That's, that's almost larger than the one that
2019080	2025880	had here in the U S uh, so it's very big. Um, and what was the effect of that? Well,
2025880	2031560	a lot more 3DS is sold and this week it was announced that, uh, let's see, uh,
2032600	2037880	a couple different figures are out there about exactly how many units sold between August 8th
2037880	2045640	and August 14th. But generally it's around 210,000 units. Keep in mind that the launch
2045640	2053720	week of the system saw about what, 350,000 units sold or no 375,000 units sold. So
2054360	2058440	by cutting the price, you got numbers that were almost back to launch week. I mean,
2058440	2064840	the numbers this past week were larger than they were in week two and it pushed the, um,
2064840	2074520	the adoption mark past 1.5 million. So apparently the price cut did exactly what Nintendo needed
2074520	2079560	it to do and it moved more systems, right? Exactly. It was just an overpriced system.
2079560	2086200	And right now, I mean, they could have probably, you know, put it out the original price if they
2086200	2090040	had a good lineup of games, but they didn't. So they need to do something either put out some
2090040	2094840	good games or drop the price. And right now they need to drop the price if they want to
2094840	2098440	gain momentum going into the fourth quarter. Well, here's the other thing I want to know about,
2098440	2103480	and that is what is the sales going to look like the next week? Because I'm sure you had a lot of
2103480	2108200	running, a lot of people that ran out and bought one, especially in the U S because we had those
2108200	2112520	stores that all cut the price early so that folks could get on that. And then they could be the
2112520	2116600	early adopters as well. And I'm sure the sales figures in the U S are going to look very similar
2116600	2120920	when those numbers come out very soon. But I'm curious, what's it going to look like in two
2120920	2125880	weeks? What's the long term sales of this? And then of course, through the holiday, I really
2125880	2130120	don't think any of this matters until the holiday. The holiday is what really going to make or break
2130120	2135960	the system. Yeah, honestly, it didn't really, from my perspective, it didn't really do much. I mean,
2135960	2141000	none of my customers are really buying more systems. They were just kind of like, great,
2141000	2144520	you know, now I can get rid of the system that's been sitting on my shelf for four months.
2144520	2151240	Wanting to sell the shit they have. Yeah. So, I mean, I don't know if that's the situation.
2151240	2156200	If, if a lot of the retailers out there were just sitting on these systems, then you may not see
2156200	2161880	the spike that you see in Japan right now. I mean, I'm sure it'll help, but just, I don't know if
2161880	2167640	it's going to be, you know, that significant. Uh, Akuma JP is in our chat room right now at
2167640	2172440	chat.orangeandre.com. And he is a listener of ours from Japan. And he says, uh, kind of in response
2172440	2178040	to this, a lot of mothers complained because they bought it on the first day. Oh, I'll tell you
2178040	2183800	something. I'll tell you what you're going to see in this. I guarantee you'll see this by early next
2183800	2189160	month. You're going to see Nintendo come out because the NPD numbers are going to come out.
2189160	2195720	3DS is the top handheld system of August. Yeah, because the PSP isn't selling very well. The DS
2195720	2199960	isn't selling very well. Of course, the 3DS is going to be the top system now that they did a
2199960	2205720	price drop, but that's, you know, PR spin for you. So look for that early next month. Well, what,
2205720	2210520	what's the long-term effect of a statement like that? Again, I don't see soccer moms running out
2210520	2215640	and buying a 3DS because, oh, well, it was the top selling system in August, according to NPD.
2215640	2219880	Well, they're just hoping that that kind of momentum will carry on. And it very well might,
2219880	2226440	I mean, cause you know, the DS and the PSP are kind of being phased out. When that Mario game
2226440	2231720	hits all they have to do. Look, this is all Nintendo has to do. Bundle that fucking Mario
2231720	2238200	game with a 3DS. That thing will sell like crazy for Christmas. Watch Dan's holding off until the,
2238200	2243800	the flame one comes out. Cause that's what he wants. He wants the flare red. Yeah. And he wants
2243800	2253240	the 3D. He likes his 3DS is like, he likes his homosexuals flaming and yeah. Red red stands,
2253240	2258440	favorite color. And he wants any what? Star Fox. So those are what's selling it for him. I just
2259480	2264840	like, if Nintendo wants to sell a shit ton of 3DS is that's all they have to do. And like kids
2264840	2269400	will be wanting that shit all Christmas long. And it'll be a huge thing that ends up under the
2269400	2274600	Christmas tree this year. It, it might even end up being the must have toy. Like if this shit does
2274600	2279480	Netflix and all this other stuff, like Nintendo could make this the must have toy. What, what
2279480	2284360	it's going to be the must have toy. I thought, and this is coming from Activision. I thought
2284360	2290440	Skylanders was going to be the must have toy. What the fuck is a Skylanders? Exactly. It's
2290440	2294440	a pain in my ass is what it is right now. And we'll get into that later on, but
2298200	2303400	it's active. I th I, you know, I, I'm trying to say this without sounding like a fan boy and
2303400	2307160	believe you, you, you all heard what I said about what I did with my Wii earlier. So look that,
2307160	2310920	that shows you where I'm at. I think the 3DS will be the top selling system. I think it will
2310920	2319400	outsell the consoles. Rob's modified his Wii. I needed it to be more versatile. So, but no,
2319400	2325480	seriously, I think the 3DS will sell more than the, uh, living room consoles because I think
2325480	2332120	most people that want to have an Xbox 360 already have one. The only maybe kind of possibly that
2332120	2336200	could screw me on that prediction would be the PlayStation three. I think that the whole price
2336200	2340760	cut for the PlayStation three, the fact that it plays Blu rays, the fact that it's going to do
2340760	2346440	3d, I don't underestimate that shit. Do not underestimate the power of that shit. Also
2346440	2352600	do not underestimate the power of Microsoft. And if they feel that their sales are dipping because
2352600	2358920	of the PlayStation three dropping in price, they can still drop the price. Remember you angry,
2358920	2366440	cynical, sarcastic gamers, soccer moms do not think like you. So they are not rational. They
2366440	2372520	can be, they should be put down immediately when spotted. No, I'm kidding. I'm kidding.
2372520	2377880	But you know what I mean? No mercy, no remorse. And they will not stop until you are dead.
2378600	2384440	But that's pretty much that. That's what it is. Like I, I love when I read predictions on gaming
2384440	2388680	sites from gaming fanboys going, you know, well, this is going to be this way because gamers want
2388680	2393000	this to do without realizing, well, soccer moms spend more money than gamers do probably at the
2393000	2396920	end of the day. Why else is the, we, the number one console for so many years, let's be real
2397640	2401480	because soccer moms by, uh, you know, black ops
2404520	2408280	and well, actually they do because they don't, they don't read.
2409480	2414520	So I think the Vita getting out of Nintendo's way, essentially, whether that was intentional
2414520	2420120	or not. Whereas I think, so I honestly think Sony's just trying to plan a better launch.
2420120	2424040	I think Sony was starting to realize they did not want to have a launch go like the 3DS has launched.
2424040	2427240	And if they didn't have the games to back it up, they shouldn't launch their system. I think that's
2427240	2431960	why they've, they've held it back a little bit, uh, at least in America and Europe. I don't know
2431960	2435240	why they're still going ahead in Japan. Maybe there's going to be more games out there. I don't
2435240	2441720	know. So we'll see, but it's just, it's totally cleared the way for 3DS is to just fly these
2441720	2447720	holidays. We'll see. Maybe I'll be wrong. It's happened before. Spread your wings and fly 3DS,
2447720	2452040	spread your wings and fly. All right, let's move on to some other stories, Dark Sakura. Well,
2452040	2458520	better that it spreads that than something else. Anyway, um, moving forward. Well,
2458520	2463960	Japanese retailers are not going to be, uh, doing much with the Xbox 360 anymore. Um,
2463960	2470760	it just hit 1.5 million units sold, which is basically that's in six years by the way,
2470760	2477240	which is basically what the 3DS did in six months. And that was considered selling badly.
2478040	2480760	You know why it's not doing well over there? Cause they're racist.
2482600	2487320	The last big Japanese exclusive came out. Idol master two is actually going to be coming
2487320	2492680	out on PlayStation three now. So, I mean, it's the biggest retailer out there. Geo is cutting
2492680	2497400	back their stock, but said that they're still going to be available online. By the way,
2497400	2501000	totally hacking my Xbox next so I can play idle master. Just saying.
2502760	2509640	Well, I would rather play Hatsune Miku, but anyway, um, at any rate, uh, the quotes going
2509640	2515000	on saying is, uh, that it is our understanding that Amazon now handles a substantial portion
2515000	2520120	of Japanese Xbox 360 software sales. So basically there's a, you want it, get it online.
2520120	2529880	Amazon.co.jp. That's it. We could special order one of those for you. Yeah. What do you think?
2529880	2534920	Is this, is this really, really bad news for the 360 or is this, eh, all right.
2534920	2540440	It's not surprising. The system really isn't the system. The games aren't really geared
2540440	2546920	towards Japanese players. I think, you know, it, this is my thought is that it's sort of like
2546920	2552200	the reverse Dreamcast or the Saturn. There's a good example of the Saturn.
2554040	2562040	Sega Saturn in Japan, fantastic. It was top seller. It, it really was well supported,
2562040	2569080	great games. Over in the US, not so good. Not so good. You know, how many people do you know who
2569080	2573960	still have like an old, you know, Nintendo just hanging, not Nintendo, uh, a PlayStation sitting
2573960	2578680	in their closet collecting dust, but never ever played a Saturn. You know, that's over here.
2579320	2584440	And then you, you sort of got the converse going on now with the Xbox 360 and, and with the Xbox
2584440	2591560	that it just didn't catch on over there. Maybe it was marketing. Maybe it was that it wasn't a,
2591560	2600200	uh, a long time trusted brand over there, perhaps. Uh, whatever reason that it is,
2600200	2605240	but I think that it's, it's the same situation. It's not marketed the right way. It's not pushing
2605240	2610200	towards that audience. The Saturn over here could have completely dominated the PlayStation because
2610840	2615240	tech wise, except for the 3D, it was a better system, better sound quality,
2615240	2621800	a better 2D graphics, better processors, you know, internal, you know, internal memory.
2621800	2632600	But yeah, if that makes sense. Yeah. So, well, I don't know. I mean,
2632600	2636840	I don't think it necessarily spells the end of the 360. Certainly they're going to keep pushing
2636840	2642280	forward. They've done very well in the U S that's for sure. That's the point is that
2642280	2647000	this performance here has been good enough because I mean, I'm sure the Dreamcast release
2647000	2653320	in Japan was not based on American sales of the Saturn. I can tell you that, but it could
2653320	2658200	possibly be that maybe the next Microsoft system to come out won't come out in Japan.
2659560	2664040	It's not even. That could be very interesting if that happens. I can't, I honestly can't see
2664040	2669400	that happening. I think Microsoft has to try again. You know what I see if it, if it does
2669400	2677880	happen that way, we get a system over here that's not region locked or it's only available online.
2677880	2681320	God, I wish that you know, wish a non region lock system would happen.
2681320	2687240	Most of the games that come out on the 360 are not region locked. Just saying. I mean,
2687800	2693240	it's a lot of the Japanese games that come out are for some reason from the Japanese companies,
2693240	2699400	but for the most part, a lot of like your big first party games like EA or first party,
2699400	2704040	third party games like from EA, Ubisoft, that kind of stuff. They are not region locked.
2705000	2713240	You just have to look online either on release sites or on, um, like a play Asia has a good list
2713240	2717320	of, you know, stuff that's not region locked and you can literally import that stuff back and forth.
2717320	2720760	There are a few Japanese games do come out over there region free and you can bring them over
2720760	2726360	here. There was some of the cave shmups that were region free, but, um, you know, it's rare.
2726360	2731320	It's definitely more rare, but, um, you know, if you really want to, you can play some games,
2731320	2735320	you know, way before they come out over here. Like for example, all the IDOS games come out over
2735320	2740120	in the UK a lot earlier than they come out over here. So you can play some of that stuff.
2740680	2745480	Well, I seriously think that if they were going to be smart about it and try to,
2745480	2751320	I guess, avoid the same situation, then when they bring out a US game, they have a Japanese
2751320	2759720	subtitle on it already or a Japanese menu that's just available through options. Because, I mean,
2759720	2764600	I don't know how many Japanese games I have that have menus fully in English, so it's not a big
2764600	2768840	deal. And even if the next system is region locked, most likely it's going to be on blu-ray or some
2768840	2774040	sort of proprietary format. I'm going to guess probably blu-ray. Um, and, um, I think that's
2774040	2779560	because of blu-ray. Um, and if that's the case, we're the same region as Japan anyways, blu-ray
2779560	2785640	wise. Uh, video, I mean. No we're not. Yes we are. No we are not. It's region A. They're both the
2785640	2790200	same. Oh, well, for blu-ray. I'm sorry, I was thinking DVD. We're not the same for DVD. Well,
2790200	2795560	yes, not for DVD. For blu-ray, we are the same region. But regardless, the point that I was
2795560	2799560	trying to make is that if they're going to be smart about this, they'll keep, they'll have all
2799560	2806120	one already, I wouldn't say fully localized, but they will have menus. Or, you know, even work
2806120	2813720	with, um, you know, between the Japanese staff and American staff for, um, for, uh, uh, two
2813720	2820280	country developers, you know what I mean? And, uh, then release, you know, a version that's got
2820280	2825000	just everything in it already. Like, like, okay, here's an example. Sonic Adventure, when it came
2825000	2830600	out in the US, had Japanese subtitles and the Japanese voices in it, and the English voices.
2831560	2834760	Can I ask this real quick, because Brakeman's asking this in the chat room, and this is a
2834760	2838440	really good question that I, I don't even, I'm not even sure I know the answer to this.
2839000	2844600	Uh, Brakeman in chat asks, OLR, seriously, why is region locking so important to these companies?
2844600	2849000	What's the point? I know part of it has to do with demographics. It's licensing, right?
2849000	2854920	Usually they will license stuff for certain regions. Um, you know, obviously some of them,
2854920	2861960	they just kind of don't put it in there. Branding 2. Branding 2. Um, I can see we're like the NFL
2861960	2867400	games, you know, NFL's very protective about their shit. And so I'm sure those NFL games have to be
2867400	2873000	region locked. No, they're not. What'd you say that for? They're not region locked. They're not?
2873000	2877640	They're not. You've got to be kidding me. No, I'm not kidding. Oh my God. All right. I would've,
2877640	2882840	I would've guessed for sure. The sports games have the licensing thing. I know to the black
2882840	2887640	cauldron here of, uh, going back to the roots of OLR, how we were about music games, remember
2887640	2892680	Konami and all the games, like, you know, all the machines that you saw over here were being
2892680	2896920	imported from Japan and they really technically weren't supposed to be, they were quote unquote
2896920	2901480	illegal. Um, but it was kind of one of those things they didn't really enforce. Konami just
2901480	2906280	kind of quietly turned their backs to it because, you know, obviously it was raising awareness for
2906280	2910120	all the console versions, but it did actually have an official us machine, right? Those songs
2910120	2915720	were licensed for Japan. And when it comes to, it's kind of similar, I think to like a jukebox
2915720	2918840	license or something. When you play music in a store like that, you know, you're actually
2918840	2925640	supposed to be paying the record labels for all that crap. So, and a lot of the stuff though,
2925640	2930760	cause, um, they had that deal with, uh, Avex for some of their games and then, um,
2930760	2936920	all the, uh, what am I thinking? Dance Mania stuff. So it's a little back and forth with,
2936920	2943080	uh, Madden. Well, Madden, um, Madden has been region free the last couple of games, um, 10
2943080	2949560	and 11 were both region free. NCAA football though in the US this year was not region free.
2949560	2956920	It was only, uh, NCSC. Um, then for example, some games that are coming out that are already
2956920	2964760	leaked out, uh, DSX, uh, human revolution region free, uh, Colorado is the cartel. That's also
2964760	2974200	region free. Uh, captain America was region free. Harry Potter was region free. Uh, there's
2974200	2979880	a tour to France game that came out, uh, not even in our region, but that's both region,
2979880	2984760	uh, for pal and NTSC kind of funny there. That's a game that's never came out. Now over
2984760	2991480	here, not that I'd play it, but whatever. Um, UFC personal trainer, Naughty Bear gold
2991480	2999320	edition, uh, dynasty warriors three. Um, it's just a lot of, a lot of games. A lot of them
2999320	3004360	are coming out all region. They just don't really advertise it. However, though, a lot
3004360	3008520	of times you'll see the Japanese only games like red faction Armageddon in Japan as only
3008520	3012760	a Japanese region game, same with like Sean White and that kind of stuff. But, uh, the
3012760	3019960	versions that come out over here, I believe, um, are all region. In fact, go to our chat
3019960	3023960	room real quick. Again, chat that orange on studio.com Frisbee asks, but like, for example,
3023960	3027800	if I buy a Japanese game from a website in Japan, would that affect licensing seeing
3027800	3032360	as you buy it from that country? Um, I think what you're talking about, I think you kind
3032360	3035960	of answered your own question because you know, when you're buying a game from Japan,
3035960	3041240	well, your money went to a Japanese company. I will tell you this. Most, um, Japanese,
3041240	3051240	uh, sites will not mail to the US. Um, like for example, Amazon. Um, I've ordered, you
3051240	3057240	know, I've ordered like a couple of books and a couple of CDs. Um, but other than that,
3057240	3061480	I haven't ever been able to order games from there. They won't take your credit card information.
3061480	3066520	When I was ordering my, because I had the money I was going to order my 2DX controller,
3066520	3070760	it wouldn't take my credit card. It wouldn't ship. Even when I was going to ship to a Japanese
3070760	3075560	address to then ship to me, it would not take my credit card. Some of these stores over here that
3075560	3079160	sell the import stuff, the way they're doing it is that they have an alliance with a Japanese
3079160	3082760	retailer who's feeding them all the goods. I mean, that's, that's how they do it. Toys
3082760	3088120	and Joys is out of Hawaii. So they actually bring stuff back. That's how they get it really quickly.
3088120	3092120	Well, a lot of like companies are selling to these guys. I'm assuming that it's Japanese
3092120	3097720	distributors for games and stuff like that. It's basically, you know, as long as we're
3097720	3103800	shipping to a country or a location within that country, it doesn't really matter what you do
3103800	3109960	with it. We don't want to know what you do with it. It's just, you know, if you're going to
3109960	3113560	distribute it in another country, you're not really supposed to do that. But once again,
3113560	3119080	we're just selling it to that person. What they do with it from there, you know, that's a whole
3119080	3129080	other thing. All right, well, it is kind of stupid that they have region locks stuff on there, but
3129080	3134360	quite the conversation we've had stemming from the Xbox 360 chat in Japan. But let's move on.
3134360	3137720	We got some more stories to cover here before we get to release dates and then the classic game of
3137720	3142600	the week. The PlayStation Vita, there's some more information that came out about it. It was rumored
3142600	3147560	that the RAM was halved to drop the price of the system so that it would be able to compete with
3147560	3155320	the 3DS. However, that is not true. The PlayStation Vita actually has more RAM than the PlayStation 3
3155320	3163800	in some cases and also a few other things. They also have cross-game chat and you can also do,
3163800	3175240	I guess it's part of their party system. The system has 512 MB of RAM and 128 MB of video RAM
3175240	3183240	compared to the PlayStation 3's 256 MB of system RAM and 256 MB of video RAM. While, of course,
3183240	3189000	the RAM is smaller on the video side, the resolution isn't as great as the PlayStation 3,
3189000	3195000	so it doesn't require as much RAM for textures and stuff as the PlayStation 3 is. But definitely
3195000	3201640	with that kind of RAM in there will allow a lot more flexibility with different games and stuff
3201640	3207240	because I know a lot of people have to optimize their game and do different things and cut stuff
3207240	3215080	just to, you know, have it run in the limited RAM. So that's kind of cool. So we'll see some
3215080	3221160	pretty good games coming on that system, I'm guessing, because of that. We can hope. That's
3221160	3227480	good. I guess RAM's getting cheaper overall, huh? Oh yeah, it's dirt cheap. All right, moving on,
3227480	3230520	talking about the Vita and some of the other things that were announced for the Vita this
3230520	3235240	week at Gamescom, PlayStation Vita is going to be getting some more social integration.
3236120	3239880	In fact, they're going to get some of the things that you usually hear about when you think about
3239880	3245960	more of the iOS type of apps, or I guess you could say Android as well. Things like Foursquare, Skype,
3246600	3252440	Twitter, Facebook, all of that is going to be in the PlayStation Vita. And I guess that's part of,
3252440	3257160	you know, what you can use the whole 3G and all that for. Remember the AT&T 3G that everybody
3257160	3261800	was really excited about? All four of those apps, they're going to be free downloads from the
3261800	3269080	PlayStation Network. Doesn't quite say, you know, they didn't hint at if it's going to be at launch
3269080	3273960	or if it's going to be a ways after that. I imagine none of these apps are that complicated.
3273960	3278120	I'm sure they'll be out, you know, what else is also interesting about them is I believe all of
3278120	3283240	them, except maybe Skype, have open APIs. So they ought to be really easy to develop the apps.
3283240	3289000	Somebody to get in there and do them. So I can't imagine it will be much further after launch if
3289000	3294280	it's not at launch. So it could be and some are theorizing that maybe they're just going to be
3294280	3298280	right on the device when you get them. You won't even have to download them. They'll just be free
3298280	3303400	and on the device waiting for you to use. That'd be nice. Yep. So there you go. All that integration
3303400	3308440	is going to be there. What do you guys think? I think that Skype specifically is interesting,
3308440	3314200	of course, because Skype is now a Microsoft product. But, you know, I don't think that
3314200	3319960	necessarily means that Skype is all things Microsoft and only all things Microsoft at this
3319960	3324760	point anymore. I just think that's it. And that was probably something planned well before the
3324760	3329880	purchase of Skype. But what about the rest of this integration? Is this a good thing for the
3329880	3334920	Vita? Is this a bad thing? Is this a no one really gives a shit type of thing? That's kind of where
3334920	3340360	I'm at with it is I'm like, well, I guess some of the things are cool. Like if you don't have an
3340360	3344120	iPhone or an Android or some of the one of the other phone devices that runs all this stuff. But
3344920	3353080	I mean, I can't really see using Twitter on my PS Vita because, like, how often do I use Twitter
3353080	3359080	on my Xbox 360? Let me think. Oh, never. I used it once to say, hey, I'm writing a tweet for my
3359080	3364040	360. I think everybody did now. I think, though, that you would use it a bit more on like a Vita
3364040	3368680	than you would, say, at 360 because I'm taking it with. I agree. At least at least the Vita's on
3368680	3372520	the go with you. And it makes more sense for things like four square and so forth. But again,
3372520	3378360	I own an iPhone. I don't need it in a Vita. Yeah, but I understand not everybody's like me. You
3378360	3383720	might have a college kid who doesn't really want to pay the amount you have to pay a month to have
3383720	3388600	an iPhone. So they have, like, a cheaper phone that just gets the calling job done at calling
3388600	3393160	and texting in the basics. And then, you know, we'll have the Vita to do all this fancier stuff
3393160	3399720	like the check ins and so forth. Facebook status updates. I'm thinking this also paves the way for,
3399720	3404120	you know, I don't know this. I don't know how I feel about this in a lot of games, but it will
3404120	3408120	pave the way for games to automatically post to your Facebook and your Twitter.
3408840	3413640	I just got to level three. Whoopee. Well, they already have a lot of stuff. I know. Oh,
3413640	3419640	I know they do, but not as much as I would think. And especially, like, you don't see it in any 3DS
3419640	3428440	games that I know of. Um, and if they are, they're not first party. There's a DS game. I know that
3428440	3433080	has that. Okay. Like one DS game, right? You know, there's not, there's not, you don't see it in a
3433080	3436840	lot of the games right now. Whereas I think including this stuff on the PS Vita kind of
3436840	3442600	opens the door for more of that stuff. I don't, do people want that? Do people really want that?
3442600	3447960	Their Twitter to just be filled up with, yay, I unlocked a trophy. Whoopee. I mean, I guess I have
3447960	3454280	the trophy stuff post to my Facebook, which I kind of show that more as a way to kind of like tell
3454280	3458440	people what games I'm really into right now without having to put an update. But some of
3458440	3463240	it's really cumbersome. Like I would not want updates to go up. Like you can have your thing
3463240	3467240	announced to Facebook every time you download something. And I think that's retarded. I mean,
3467240	3478120	ridiculous. That's too much. Porn, porn, porn, porn, porn. So yeah. Uh, break man in our chat
3478120	3485400	room says, can I get a Vita that just plays video games? Can it be cheaper then? Break man also says
3485400	3495080	fucking Facebook. Can I pay extra to have that not installed? Yikes. No word on Google plus or as we
3495080	3498840	call it on Hoard House, Google positive. No word if Google positive will be one of the apps that
3498840	3503800	will be on the PlayStation Vita. All right. Uh, also one of the quick thing I got to say about
3503800	3508680	the Vita, apparently one other thing that they're saying, every PlayStation Vita game will also be
3509400	3516200	downloadable to what storage on the PlayStation Vita because there is no storage on the Vita
3516200	3525000	memory cards. Yeah. Why would I buy, why would I buy the game? Think about this. Not only can you
3525000	3531160	buy the cartridge version of the game for the same price, you can download it off the internet
3532040	3538360	and you could buy a memory card to put it on. Why would I do that? That's stupid. Why would you
3538360	3542840	do that? And no, I guarantee there's not going to be a discount for buying it online. There never is
3542840	3547000	a fucking discount. Well, what if you're a PlayStation plus subscriber? Maybe you'll get
3547000	3556440	a discount. Please. Come on. Okay. So I don't know. That's just stupid. But what if, Loki,
3556440	3562440	what if you have to have the game right now and I'm so fat that I can't fit my car anymore.
3563000	3567480	So I will not be able to drive to the store to get it, but I have to have the game right now.
3569240	3575960	Well, that's great. You can also purchase a digital copy that you can't resell. Can't
3575960	3582520	sell it used again. So, you know, um, and it will cost you more money because you have to buy a
3582520	3588360	memory card. That's win win. But at least I didn't have to buy the gas to get down to buy. Yeah,
3588360	3594360	come on. If the gas is that much of a problem for you and you know what you.
3597720	3603960	I'm sorry, gas is not that expensive yet. It's not going to cost you a gallon of gas to get down
3603960	3609480	there. And I guarantee that memory card, you know, it's going to be more than a few bucks.
3609480	3613240	It's probably like, well, tiger claw on our chat saying memory cards are cheap nowadays.
3614600	3619480	Yeah. Regular memory cards are cheap nowadays, but this is Sony's proprietary memory card.
3619480	3624600	Just like, you know, Microsoft has their, it's not even really proprietary. It's a proprietary
3624600	3630360	case that we put a laptop hard drive in that we can charge a lot more money for our memory cards
3630360	3635320	or, or even how they've gone to the point where they're like, Hey, we got some USB memory cards
3635320	3639560	that you can use that, you know, I know you can use any thumb drive out there. That's, you know,
3639560	3645480	really cheap, but ours are $50 for four gigs or whatever was like, come on.
3646360	3651080	That's like the, uh, three DS or not three DS. I'm sorry. The Nintendo, we SD cards,
3652200	3655880	you know, the, we will take any SD card, but if you want to get a Nintendo, we SD card
3655880	3660920	that has the little sticker that says Nintendo, we on it, it costs like twice as much sticker
3660920	3664120	that says we, by the way, they're just like SanDisk cards or something like that. But
3664120	3669480	they're actually like another company that makes them obviously. Um, it, it's just,
3669480	3674040	unless you're getting some sort of discount on it, like it's half the price,
3675640	3680600	then I see no reason this, which, which Sony may do those kinds of crazy sales online or,
3680600	3685400	and, and see, I don't understand why they, well, I understand why they have proprietary memory cards
3685400	3689000	because they don't want people hacking the system, but at the same time, and I was kind of shocked
3689000	3693720	because I had to buy my mom a camera, a Sony camera, and I'm like, okay. And he's like,
3693720	3698120	okay, you can pick one of these new memory cards here. And they're like, you know, SDHC cards.
3698120	3703480	I'm like, wait a second. Uh, don't I have to get a memory stick? No, they stopped using
3703480	3708840	memory stick a while ago. I'm like, thank God, you know, get with the program using,
3708840	3714360	you know, common format. Um, so that was kind of cool that they have that, but I don't understand
3714360	3719720	why they don't take those anyways. Um, on top of their, well, I understand once again, it's
3719720	3726120	piracy. They're worried about people targeting it. It will still happen. I was gonna say,
3726120	3732360	how long will that last before it invents a reader or something? It's not even gonna need
3732360	3737640	a reader. It's just those have USB cables that plug into the computers that you can download
3737640	3743400	stuff through those cards. So yeah, that'll take a long time. All right, we'll see what happens.
3743400	3747720	All right. Meanwhile, Dark Sakura has got a story for us. Then we're gonna get to the release dates.
3747720	3756200	Nintendo says, I'm sorry, my bad. Uh, basically when Xenoblade came out in the UK, if you bought
3756200	3762920	it in a, if you pre-ordered in a store, you'd get, um, an exclusive classic controller. It was
3762920	3769960	red and you could get three A1 size posters signed by the developer, but they did not specify that
3769960	3778120	if you did your pre-orders online, you would not be getting the posters. And they said, oops, if you
3778120	3782280	previously placed an online pre-order to get these posters sent with your copy of the pre-order
3782280	3786520	bundle, please get in contact with game or game station using links. Yeah, they've got links on
3786520	3791240	there. So basically if you're in the UK and you pre-ordered, um, online and wanted your poster and
3791240	3796040	were under the impression you'd be getting a poster, um, contact the retailer and tell them
3796040	3801640	that Nintendo sucks. It's just a fucking poster. And it's not even, it's not even personally
3801640	3806040	signed. It's digitally signed by the developer. So it's basically photoshopped on there. They
3806040	3812120	did not have their pens out. It's photoshopped. It was, it was the robo pen. It's what it was.
3812120	3817240	Just like Obama uses to sign pens. Is that the digipen? Well, you know, there's a company,
3817240	3826840	digipen. It's photoshopped. Oops. So yeah. But still, I mean, I, I, I get it though.
3826840	3830040	As much as I'm giving these people a hard time for being mad about their posters,
3830040	3834280	I understand the fact that it is principle and I understand the fact that Nintendo hasn't been
3834280	3839000	making a lot of smart decisions lately. So why not, you know, kick a little more dirt at them.
3839000	3842040	And if you pre-ordered online in America, you're just not getting the game.
3842040	3848600	Exactly. Here's a lovely poster you can have as a parting gift.
3849160	3852920	All right, let's move on to travel the world and look at some release dates and what's coming out
3852920	3857640	to a store near you quite soon. Well, I hope this week that you're interested in a certain
3857640	3863240	Square Enix game called Deus Ex Human Revolution. That'd be coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox
3863240	3868680	360. Also, they have a special edition called the augmented edition. Oh, and also on PC.
3868680	3872520	Um, I hope you're interested because that's really, that's all that's coming out this week.
3872520	3876520	That's brand new. However, if you want some cheaper games from Nintendo, they'll be happy
3876520	3883240	to send you their Wii Selects games, including now, uh, Super Mario Galaxy, Super Paper Mario,
3883240	3892200	Super Mario Strikers Charged and Punch Out, all for $19.99. That's it. Oh, I'm sorry.
3892200	3897320	Shimagami Tensei Devil Survivor Overclocked for the 3DS. Although I thought that was coming out
3897320	3904840	the week after next, but whatever. All right. Well, it sounds like an exciting week in the US.
3904840	3909560	Let's move to Japan and see how exciting it is over there and their releases. Uh, pretty much
3909560	3915480	the same story, except they don't even have Deus Ex. They get Dirt 3, uh, this week in Japan on
3915480	3919800	August the 25th. That's coming out on the Xbox 360. I'm sure we're going to start to see those
3919800	3925480	Xbox 360 releases get scaled back quite a bit. Uh, on the PlayStation 3 though, they have Dirt 3
3925480	3931720	as well. I guess this, this is probably the big game. Monster Hunter Portable 3rd HD version
3931720	3936440	coming out on the PlayStation 3. Wasn't this, this whole PSP game getting remade for the PS3?
3936440	3940840	Yes. Yes. That is finally hitting the shelves this week. I have a friend who's so psychotic
3940840	3944920	about that game. I was going to say that that's probably the big thing people are excited about
3944920	3950680	this week in Japan. Uh, but some people might also be into the Koei games and Sengoku Musou
3950680	3956600	3 Empires is coming out this week as well. So if you are into that empire, what, this is just
3956600	3962760	Dynasty Warriors, but the, uh, Samurai Warriors. But this is the, this is the spinoff, uh, that
3962760	3969320	has more strategic elements, right? Yeah, Empires 3. I think it's, well, Sengoku. I think it's
3969320	3976520	Samurai Warriors 3. Uh, alrighty. Uh, Empires. No, that would be Romance of the Three Kingdoms.
3976520	3983400	Oh, maybe it is. Yeah. Uh, that's really it on the PlayStation 3, but I will mention on the
3983400	3989960	Sony PSP, there's Black Rock Shooter. The game is out this week on the PSP. Uh, there's lots of,
3989960	3994440	uh, like special additions. One of them comes with this cute little figurine, a little anime,
3994440	3999880	uh, character dressed in white there. Uh, I kind of like that. It looks like a vinylmation figure
3999880	4003480	and the game itself. I don't know. I'm looking, just looking at the screenshots. I don't know.
4003480	4007960	It's kind of like Sin and Punishment slash RPG-ish to me. So that's that. Black Rock Shooter on the
4007960	4014520	Sony PSP, as well as Mobile Suit Gundam Shin Giren no Yabu, because it's just not a Japanese month
4014520	4020200	without a new Gundam game. And I believe that is pretty much it for releases. I'm trying to look
4020200	4025960	at the, uh, 3DS real quick to see if there's anything of note there. Uh, not this week.
4027400	4032120	So shall we go to Europe? Yep. On the 23rd, we have Call of Dirty Black Ops Resurrection on
4032120	4037480	Xbox 360. And on the 24th, Hamilton's Great Adventure, Street Fighter III Third Strike,
4038440	4044760	Tropico IV. Oh, that's, um, and then on the 26th, which is Friday, there's Pac-Man and
4044760	4051560	Galaga Dimensions, Rugby World Cup 2011, and Deus Ex Human Revolution. Yay!
4053800	4058440	Sweet. All right. Let's, uh, get a couple more stories in before we get to the classic game of
4058440	4065400	the week. Loki. Uh, yes. Um, we talked about the new PSP that's coming to Europe that has Wi-Fi
4065400	4071400	removed. Well, Nintendo not to be outdone by Sony. They're removing some other stuff in the
4071400	4079880	brand new Wii that is coming out in the UK regions as well. Um, the value Wii for that region, uh,
4079880	4083960	will be coming out. Uh, they haven't really given a price yet. It's supposed to be cheaper.
4083960	4092680	Um, it is designed to sit horizontally instead of vertically. And, uh, apparently the GameCube
4092680	4099880	backwards compatibility, both accessories and games, has been removed. And I guess it'll be
4099880	4105640	sometime- do out- What a great feature. Do some- do out sometime before Christmas. Uh, it's gonna
4105640	4110680	include, I guess, a Wii Remote Plus, Nunchuck, Wii Party, and Wii Sports. Wii Party. Wow, that-
4110680	4114280	that's a throwaway game. They must have had a bunch of extra copies of that. Um,
4116600	4123480	yeah, fun times. Well, let's be real, though. How many people are still emulating GameCube games?
4123480	4128040	I can think of- and I know as the minute I said that, the chat room's gonna light up with this.
4128040	4132760	I can think of one that I play, and that's F0. That's it. All right. And they really just need
4132760	4137320	to give that a proper wheelies. Fair enough, but here's gonna be the argument, and I'm sure a lot
4137320	4142280	of people in chat are gonna make this. A lot of games, they have the support for playing with a
4142280	4147240	GameCube controller. Like, for example, Smash Brothers, or Mario Kart, and that kind of stuff.
4147240	4152280	And a lot of people prefer the GameCube controller, or Wavebird, or whatever, to the Wii
4152280	4157080	Remote, you know, steering, and that kind of bullshit that they have. Um, so that's what a lot
4157080	4160600	of people are probably pissed off about, because they don't want to use the classic controller.
4160600	4164680	I'll give you that. But, I mean, cutting those ports out of the system probably did-
4164680	4168680	All they would have to do, all they would have to do is create some sort of Wavebird thing that
4168680	4175480	plugs, you know, into either wirelessly, or tethered to, you know, the Wii Remote. And boom,
4175480	4179960	everyone's happy. But the audience that needs something like that is probably not the same
4179960	4183800	audience that this console's geared at. I mean, this is really about getting the Wiis into homes
4183800	4188760	that don't already have them, which aren't a lot by now, right? And this is only coming out in
4188760	4193720	Europe again. It's not, at least they say it's not coming out here. I still say PAX next week
4193720	4197880	could change a lot of things, but I'll go with it and say that it's only probably coming out in
4197880	4205560	Europe right now. Yeah. As of right now. So. But yeah, I mean, the GameCube compatibility thing
4205560	4210120	probably isn't too surprising. Do you think that maybe, you know, since we talked earlier in the
4210120	4214120	show about hacking and stuff, that they've tried to take measures to combat all that?
4215080	4223560	Um, no. But here's something interesting, though. They're basically seeing other bundles
4223560	4232120	will also be forthcoming. And they also got word that the Nintendo will focus on the new Wii
4232120	4235720	bundles going forward, suggesting it won't coexist with the current model.
4237480	4242360	So they're going to be removing it out of all of the systems. Hmm. Going forward.
4243320	4247400	Tiger Claw in our chat says a chat that orange on Twitter dot com live on this Sunday night.
4247400	4251160	Take a look at that precious Wii and pray it never craps out if it's your only system for
4251160	4255160	GameCube's games. Otherwise you're screwed unless you actually own the original GameCube.
4255160	4260280	Don't be surprised if Nintendo rereleases GameCube games on the Wii with Wiimote support and better
4260280	4265720	graphics. They already did. And they didn't even make better graphics. They just put Wii,
4265720	4269640	you know, controls in there. Remember new play control stuff that didn't sell very well. That's
4269640	4273240	why you don't see him anymore. I'm going to go a step further and say when the Wii U virtual
4273240	4277560	console stuff hits, you're probably going to start seeing some of the GameCube stuff pop up on there.
4277560	4282120	And then maybe that's why they're starting to try and phase GameCube accessibility out. But
4282120	4285480	Breakman has a really good point in chat room. And I kind of agree with this. The original GameCube
4285480	4289240	is one of the sturdiest systems. Yeah. Those game, those GameCubes are kind of hard to break.
4289240	4293560	I don't, I didn't know anybody that ever had a broken GameCube. Ours has been dropped a couple
4293560	4298920	of times and it's lived. Yeah. I mean, the game, the GameCube was a pretty rock solid system.
4300440	4305880	Then again, I've also dropped, you know, Super Nintendo off of a, you know, a large drop and
4305880	4314120	it lived takes not so much. So anyhow. All right. Well, uh, there you go. I guess a new Wii for the
4314120	4320040	three people that don't have one yet. Meanwhile, who knows of a game called steel battalion?
4320040	4326120	I do tell the listeners what steel battalion is. If they've ever heard of it. It's a huge war sim
4326120	4329960	where you're a Mecca and it had like this huge mungus controller of which we have two now.
4329960	4335560	Um, and when the controller came out, it was like 300 bucks. It was expensive because the
4335560	4341160	controller was literally a giant, it was a console panels and switches and the red button. It was
4341160	4346280	like what you would see inside an actual Mac. It was pretty crazy. It was, it was crazy go nuts.
4346280	4353400	Well, there is a new steel battalion game coming out called heavy armor. It's a connect based game.
4353400	4357480	So I don't think they're going to be having that huge console anymore. Cause I guess they can do
4357480	4362360	this all through connect. Uh, a new trailer was announced or a new trailer was shown this week,
4362360	4367800	along with a little fact sheet. Um, apparently you will be able to use connect and the standard
4367800	4372280	X-Box three 60 controller. The controller will be used for movement, aiming and firing,
4372280	4377320	but the connect camera will use upper body gestures that you can use to start the engine,
4377320	4382440	use a turret gun, use the scope. You can communicate verbally with the crew members.
4382440	4390520	If you want as well. They talk specifically in the release about high fives. So it sounds like
4390520	4397560	they're bringing all these buttons and things that do stuff into a whole new realm, which sounds
4397560	4402920	funny to me. I don't know. I think it's going to be fun, but honestly the fun I think of the
4402920	4407800	original was you had all the buttons and all the neat little stuff to push. My favorite was the
4407800	4412840	eject button. I like to just push that button for fun. But it was the fact that you, it was
4413400	4419320	instead of, you know, moving your hand or doing something, you got to push the damn button.
4419320	4425160	You know, wasn't that the fun of it that you had the whole console there. That's true. I do like
4425160	4429320	to push buttons. You know, they need to release a peripheral for the connect. That's just a,
4429320	4432280	a board with buttons on it that I can push. Bubble wrap the game.
4432280	4438040	Oh, wait, wait, wait. I don't need buttons anymore. Cause I have the connect and that's,
4438040	4444520	that's what it's all about. I like my buttons. I like the buttons. I want to push the red one.
4446360	4451480	All right, let's get to the classic game of the week. Every week here on the program,
4451480	4455800	dark soccer dives into the gaming vault and says, Hey, back in my day, we pushed a lot of buttons
4455800	4460040	and you're going to be pushing my buttons. If you don't try this game, it's the classic game
4460040	4463480	of the week. Dark soccer. Excuse me. What'd you pick as the classic game of the week?
4464040	4467960	The classic game of the week is midnight resistance. Woo. And we can all thank Dan
4467960	4473800	for this. Cause I was like, Dan, help me think of a game. Uh, midnight resistance. Okay. So it is
4473800	4479560	a side scrolling action shooting game that data East put out in the arcade in 1989 and came out
4479560	4487640	on the mega drive. Also known as the Genesis in 1990, it was put up by ocean software in us.
4487640	4494280	Yes. It is in the future where everything sucks. And you're a member of resistance, uh,
4495000	4502280	movement dude who, uh, has to rescue his family from a mad scientist before he turns them into
4502280	4507880	donkeys or something. Not really. Anyway, basically it's Contra, but not, yeah, it's
4507880	4516120	Contra, but not. And you could do two players simultaneous. Nontra. Okay. That's what Loki said
4516120	4523160	without talking into his mic. Um, but anyway, it had a rotatable joystick. That's like the one used
4523160	4529080	in Ikari warriors, which is why this is a hard game to emulate unless you've got an arcade
4529080	4536840	controller. Um, at any rate, you also had your shoots and jumps and your, uh, you know, you
4536840	4545080	would use your little dial to adjust your aim as you went along. Um, so, uh, you could keep moving
4545080	4550040	in direction, but change your aim. It was pretty neat. And it had a power up system that was like
4550040	4555720	an, uh, heavy barrel, which was also a data East game where you would collect keys, um, after
4555720	4561080	defeating enemies and like you get six keys at a time, and then you can enter a weapon storage
4561080	4566360	and pick out different weapons and power ups and stuff. Um, your main weapons that you could get
4566360	4574440	were, uh, you, you could replace your default rifle with, um, backpack weapons that are launched.
4574440	4579960	So you'd actually push the joystick and press the shoot button to do it at the same time. Um, you
4579960	4584760	knew different special guns. You had a supercharged upgrade that would increase your firepower
4584760	4589800	and a barrier that gives you invincibility temporarily and extra lives. There's nine
4589800	4596520	stages with different obstacles. And right before the final stages, you, um, use your keys. Um,
4596520	4602440	but you'd have to battle the Crimson King. And the ending depends on how many of your family
4602440	4610120	members you rescued. Uh, when it came out for home, uh, like I said, it was published by, uh,
4610120	4617240	Data East, um, for, uh, the Mega Drive in Japan. And it's very close to the arcade version, except
4617240	4621480	of course the controllers, since, you know, it's just a Genesis pad, you couldn't have the rotatable
4621480	4626760	things. So you had four different, uh, button configurations. Um, your default controllers will
4626760	4635800	let you, um, move with the, the D-pad and hold your own steady by holding B. And then, um, you'd
4635800	4640600	actually would just heal keep moving. It's, and it was only one player, two on top of that. Uh,
4640600	4645320	further versions that came out, there was, um, and this was, like I said, by Ocean Software,
4645320	4651480	the Commodore 64. Fuck yes. I had a feeling that you were familiar with this game. How in the fuck
4651480	4656040	you did this game on the Commodore 64? I have no idea. I've got, can I look up a YouTube of that?
4656040	4661560	I got to see this on the 64. There's the ZX Spectrum, the Amstrad CPC, Commodore Amiga,
4661560	4669000	and the Atari ST. Um, some development done by Special FX. And actually one thing, um,
4669640	4675720	Rob, is that this is, uh, listed as one of the greatest games ever made for that system.
4677880	4682440	Actually, this doesn't look too terrible. I mean, for a Commodore 64 game and I caught, I love,
4682440	4686120	love, love the Commodore 64 music. Listen to the music on the C64.
4688280	4690440	Oh, of course now it changed. Hold on, let me go back a little bit.
4694840	4696680	Go back and play the, um, previous one.
4699080	4703240	Oh, the actual music? Yeah, just to compare. Sure, sure. Let me, uh, jump in here.
4707240	4710840	So you see, it's, it's, I think pretty playful. Yeah, yeah.
4710840	4716200	Um, oh, for the Spectrum, by the way, it was completely redesigned and done really cartoony.
4717080	4724440	And, uh, it had a push screen scrolling and very few colors, but it's considered to be one of the
4724440	4729960	best games on the system. And that's it. That's Midnight Resistance. All right. There it is,
4729960	4735640	your classic game of the week, Midnight Resistance for the, what system specifically? Arcade? I'm
4735640	4739800	talking about arcade, but we'll also include the home releases. All right. So the arcade slash
4739800	4745400	Mega Drive slash C64 slash other stuff, a bunch of British systems. All right. There you go. Uh,
4745400	4749880	your classic game of the week. Good pick. I, I've actually not heard of that game, but it looks kind
4749880	4754680	of interesting. So, and here I thought I knew every game that was on the Commodore 64. That's
4754680	4758520	what I thought that you would be very interested because I mean, it's lauded as one of the best
4758520	4763800	games for the Commodore 64. Well, every fucking game that was released in the eighties and the
4763800	4768360	arcades came out on the Commodore 64 at some point, but there was, there was a lot of games
4768360	4772600	on Commodore 64. I'm telling you. All right. Uh, we're gonna take a quick break guys, but we'll be
4772600	4776600	back with more of Orange Lounge Radio after this. Stay tuned. Of course, we've got more information
4776600	4781080	on VidRhythm, Harmonix's next project we're gonna talk about in the next segment, uh, as well as
4781080	4786040	Diablo 3 and some of the rumors with that. And then of course your calls, your tweets,
4786040	4789320	and much more when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4789320	4800280	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio. We are live on this Sunday evening,
4800280	4807000	August the 21st of 2011 with episode number 425 of our show. And unfortunately I can't play it
4807000	4811960	during the podcast because it's a licensed music, but the live folks got to hear a little song from
4811960	4817400	Luminous back in the, uh, PSP days. And that first came out. One of its strongest launch titles was
4817400	4822520	the puzzler game Luminous and we played the song Shinin, uh, from that game. And very excited to
4822520	4827720	hear that, uh, apparently Luminous is going to be getting a version on the PlayStation Vita as well.
4827720	4832520	I sort of thought that franchise was kind of done for after the 360 and PlayStation 3 ones,
4832520	4836760	but it sounds like maybe not. So I don't know about you guys, but I think that's pretty awesome.
4836760	4840440	I don't know what else they'll be able to kind of do with the franchise. I mean,
4840440	4847000	but you never know. I liked Luminous 2 a lot. A lot of people didn't care for it, but I loved it.
4847000	4852200	Um, because it had a lot of the licensed music and that's exactly why a lot of people didn't like it,
4852200	4855800	but I thought it was cool. Like, I'm sorry. I thought Hollaback Girl was kind of funny
4855800	4863160	to play in Luminous. I really liked, uh, well, I had a Missy Elliott song and a Beck song and
4863160	4868120	the first one we start. I really, my favorite though is still the first one. Yeah. Like I can,
4868120	4872680	you know, that's fair, but it's probably better. Both of them are probably better than the Xbox one
4872680	4879880	in my opinion. It's just the controller on the Xbox too is so, it's rough. Still surprised to
4879880	4885080	this day. They have never tried to really correct the Xbox 360 D pad in this country anyway.
4885080	4889640	Other than selling it as a premium monochrome controller that, you know, wasn't that only
4889640	4893720	available in Europe or in butt green? Really? It wasn't really. They still sell it today.
4893720	4898520	Really? It's more expensive than the regular controller. Of course. Of course. All right,
4898520	4903080	well, let's get into some rapid fire news. Some quick, quick news stories for you guys
4903080	4909160	and we're going to cover quite a bit here. Loki. Hey, guess what? Nintendo announced the launch
4909160	4916600	of their largest title for the Wii, um, maybe even to date. Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword will
4916600	4921800	be out in North America November 20th. So you can mark that down. I guess that is holiday.
4921800	4926680	And of course it will require motion plus, which, you know, God, by now you probably have
4926680	4930760	something that's motion plus. Actually, I still don't have a motion plus. Is that sad? Well,
4930760	4936120	you aren't going to play the game then. Go buy Wii Party Motion or something like that.
4936120	4945880	Get free crappy game with Thermo. This is kind of cool. There's some portal turrets coming to
4945880	4954920	Bastion on Steam. Really? Yes. Apparently they've got some cool stuff. There's a quest
4954920	4959720	exclusive for the Steam version of Bastion where the kid uses a gel canister marked with the
4959720	4968600	Aperture Science logo that contains a vicious substance of unknown origin. And if, um, you use
4968600	4975240	that, uh, friendly portal turrets, uh, will come into battle and they will shoot enemies for you.
4975240	4978680	Bobby actually sent me a YouTube of this earlier in the night. So, um, let me,
4978680	4981640	I don't know if this is going to have narration in it. Let me try to play this YouTube.
4981640	4990920	But who are we to judge? That's the narrator. So let's see. Not every squirt's born bad.
4990920	4998440	Some spring to the kid's defense. Judging by the mood of the cage, it's going to take a little
4998440	5004520	while. Oh yeah, there's the turrets. Are they talking? Yeah.
5004520	5013560	That's fantastic. Yeah, that's not in the 360 version.
5016920	5018440	Oh yeah, they're talking. That's cool.
5018440	5023160	Scumbags don't take.
5031880	5034280	Now they're all over on this screen. That's pretty cool.
5038360	5040920	Uh, I think they're kind of attaching different parts of the game together.
5042440	5046200	The music's great in this game. I like this game. It's part of the reason I'm
5046200	5049560	pissed my Xbox guy hacked. So I'd like to be playing this right now. It's pretty cool.
5054440	5054920	There you go.
5057400	5063160	Clip from Bastion plus portal. So yeah, um, you can check it out if you download the game.
5063800	5071560	And then, um, of course, one of the things that people want to see when a 3d console comes out is
5071560	5078920	boobs. Where are we talking about this just last week? Starting, I was talking about 3d websites
5078920	5083400	and how they need websites with boobs is like, I remember talking about this and Bobby said he
5083400	5087560	was going to go make the website. Even it was like 3d boobies.com or something. I remember
5087560	5092680	what we called it. I swear this came up like last week on the show. Well, apparently, uh,
5092680	5102840	the half minute hero designer, uh, Kenny Chiro, uh, Takaki, um, he is set out to create a 3ds game,
5102840	5109000	uh, based on, I guess, uh, I don't know if it's an anime or whatever, but anyways, it's called
5109000	5118200	Senran, uh, Kaguru or Kuruura. I'm sorry. And it's basically female ninjas with giant breasts.
5118200	5124600	And, uh, the game will be on sale in Japan, September 22nd. Don't plan on seeing that coming
5124600	5132280	out over here, but, uh, yeah. Uh, they've got a trailer for it. It's, um, it doesn't really show
5132280	5139720	too much. I mean, it's just kind of this anime intro thing. And then, um, you know, lots of
5139720	5147080	innuendo, like all of them sucking on stuff right now and, and large boobs. And she's pulling out
5147080	5155560	boobs and she's pulling out stuff from her boobs and yeah. Lots of breasts. Oh, and panty shot.
5158440	5162440	You say this like it's a bad thing. I mean, this is really what people want a 3ds for, right?
5162440	5169400	It's, I think it's welcomed. All right. Let's move on to some other news. This has to do with
5169400	5173880	a game coming to PlayStation network. It's a revival of an old arcade game. Elevator
5173880	5180040	action deluxe. Yes. Uh, apparently, uh, there's a new PlayStation network version. It's an HD
5180040	5184280	update of the old game. Uh, you know, I don't know if you've ever played this game. If you have,
5184280	5187320	you know, the original elevator deluxe, look up some of the clips on YouTube. I know it was on
5187320	5191640	the NES. It was very popular back in the day. So I'm sure you guys probably will recognize this
5191640	5195240	when you see some YouTube's of it. Uh, but the new version on PlayStation network, of course,
5195240	5200680	not just an HD, you know, upgrade and so forth, but there's going to be new, new weapons, um,
5200680	5206520	faster elevators, uh, multiplayer modes that are available offline, including deathmatch
5206520	5211480	and other competitive modes. So that'll be kind of neat, I guess, $10 for that. I don't know. I
5211480	5214440	always kind of thought elevator action was overrated. I did not think it was that great
5214440	5220600	of a game as far as like classic games go. I think it's one of the, uh, ones that's blown way
5220600	5224200	out of proportion, but whatever. I know some people are really into it. So will they pay $10
5224200	5229640	to revisit it? Who knows? Rockband is going to be adding some stuff from the red hot chili peppers,
5229640	5235160	and that is all coming on August 30th. Uh, I guess the, the pack is called the I'm with the
5235160	5239960	chili peppers pack because the new album is called I'm with you. Uh, some of the songs that are in
5239960	5245000	this pack. Well, why not? I'll just do all the songs, by the way, Californication, uh,
5245000	5250920	look around monarchy of roses, other side, parallel universe, scar tissue, and the adventures
5250920	5257160	of rain dance Maggie. Uh, of course the usual rock band pricing of dollar 99 on the Xbox 360
5257160	5261400	or PlayStation three, August 30th, as soon as come out, keep in mind, if the red hot chili pepper
5261400	5266360	song you were hoping for wasn't in that list, there's already quite a few in the main game. So,
5266360	5273640	uh, you'd better check the master song lists on the Xbox three sixties, uh, the S models.
5273640	5277240	If you don't have one of these yet, but you're thinking about getting one in the near future,
5277240	5281480	they're going to be changing the finish. Like for instance, Loki happens to have one here in
5281480	5284760	the studio, so I can see that it's got a very glossy look to it. You know, you can kind of
5284760	5289960	see my own reflection in it that is going away. There's going to be, what's called a matte black
5289960	5294680	will be, uh, apparently the matte black ones are the four gig systems now, but they're going to be
5294680	5300520	for all of them soon. So probably a cost saving thing, whatever. I don't think most of these sit
5300520	5304200	inside your shelves anywhere where you can't even see the matte blacks probably better. Anyway,
5304200	5308360	something picks up fingerprints, like yeah, probably won't stick, stick the fingerprints
5308360	5312360	as well and all that. So whatever, uh, those will be making their way to retailers over the coming
5312360	5315400	weeks. And certainly if you're getting one of these for the holiday, you'll probably have one
5315400	5319480	of those with the matte finish. All right. Uh, Dark Soccer, what do you have for us?
5319480	5326440	Stuff. Mega Man X2 actually has been given an ESRB rating for the Wii. So meaning that we
5326440	5331880	should have it on the virtual console at some point and it's E for everyone. Aww. You know,
5331880	5339000	that's the one that has the Shoryuken in it, right? And, um, for 3DS, Tekken 3D Prime Edition
5339000	5346440	is actually going to come with, uh, apparently it's going to come with Blood Vengeance,
5346440	5353800	which is, uh, that movie. It's going to be, uh, included, um, on the cartridge. So that sounds
5353800	5357960	like it'll be cool. So you're actually going to be watching something and it's part of the PS3
5357960	5363000	bundle for the record, which I really want to see it. And then last but not least, Little Big Planet
5363000	5369000	2 Move Pack. Here's what's going to be in it. It has a brand new story for Little Big Planet 2
5369000	5373800	called The Rise of the Cakling. Five levels, seven minigames, two cutscenes, a new powerup for
5373800	5378840	Sackboy called the Brain Crane, three move gadgets, the movinator, the move recorder, and the paint
5378840	5384680	tool, four interactive music tracks, eight music sequencer tracks, a new sound object containing
5384680	5391240	32 new sounds, 17 new music sequencer instruments, a new level background, six new costumes,
5391240	5397400	18 materials, 41 decorations, 31 objects, 66 stickers, 39 new Little Big Planet pins,
5397400	5401000	11 brand new PlayStation trophies, and a partridge in a pear tree. No price yet,
5401640	5407160	but it will be out on September 14th. I still need to buy Little Big Planet 2. Isn't that sad?
5407160	5412120	I think I'm going to keep waiting. I keep holding out for like a price reduction. Like
5412120	5416440	Loki, you do the retail thing. Do you think there'll be like a one that has the move crap
5416440	5420600	bundled in with it for like a cheaper price? They'll do probably, well, they did with the
5420600	5423240	first one, a game of the year edition. Yes, that's what I'm waiting for.
5425080	5427240	I don't think that's going to happen this year though, because
5428280	5435480	it's, last one came a year after the first one came out and I believe, what's the Little Big
5435480	5440760	Planet 2, was that this year? That was January, I think. What's that last year? It was, I think
5440760	5447320	it had been pushed to this year. It was this year. Early this year. So yeah, I don't think
5447320	5452120	that we're going to see that any cheaper. I mean, it may price drop a little bit, but
5454120	5457960	it'll be a while. All right, fine.
5457960	5461320	Probably when they have some more content packs for it.
5461320	5465880	Fine. All right. Well, let's move on. We're going to get back into some longer news and
5465880	5470600	pretty soon the Skype line. But first I want to make sure I get at least one more plug in,
5470600	5473960	because we might be starting this segment when we get back. It depends if I can get this
5473960	5478120	particular people on the show or not. But we are, again, trying very hard to feature
5478120	5482920	indie games on the show and are hoping to begin that around the Labor Day show, which will be,
5482920	5487960	of course, the show when we get back. If you are an indie developer yourself or you know someone
5487960	5492280	who's an indie developer who needs help getting the word out on the game and you think the game
5492280	5497080	is unique and special and needs a little help standing out in the Xbox Live Marketplace,
5497080	5502600	since Microsoft won't help you, we will. Or even if it's an iOS game or a PC game or wherever it is,
5502600	5507240	drop me an email, Rob at OrangeLaunchRadio.com. That's me personally. Or you can always email
5507240	5513560	the show if you'd rather. Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com and we will try to get to your
5513560	5521080	game to feature it as an indie game on the show. And even if we don't get a lot of bite on that,
5521080	5526040	we're probably just going to start the spotlights very soon. So look forward to that. All right.
5526040	5531080	Meanwhile, let's get into some longer news. Oh, other plugs. I forgot to plug the other stuff.
5531080	5534520	I already plugged Girls Gone Wow at the top of the show. I'm on it this week.
5534520	5537960	If you do like Warcraft and like one show is not enough for you this week,
5537960	5542760	please check out Horde House. HordeHouse.com, the best little Horde House in Azeroth. That's a show
5542760	5548280	that my buddy Extfer and I do about Warcraft every week. Dark Sakura will be back with the
5548280	5553560	second podcast hopefully very soon. Something I'm joining her with. Yes. Again, Labor Day-ish
5553560	5558360	once all this stuff settles because there's a lot going on personal life for Jamie and Dan
5558360	5562600	right now. So real life is intruding violently. We had to delay it a little bit, but it's still
5562600	5566840	on the radar. So sorry. We keep announcing. We've been announcing that for like six weeks now, but
5566840	5570920	things happen. But we've got like show roles and everything and stuff ready. I know. I know. We're,
5570920	5574280	we, we know what we're doing. We're ready to go. It's just a matter of doing it. So,
5574840	5577720	all right. Let's move on. Let's get into some longer news. Loki.
5578760	5584280	This is kind of creepy and interesting at the same time. I guess GameStop has been testing
5584280	5590360	a console streaming service. Right now, they're hoping to have a beta in place by the end of this
5590360	5597400	year. And right now, I mean, this should be a huge surprise because they bought a company called
5597400	5605320	Spawn Labs, which they had their own game streaming box. Basically, this would stream
5605320	5611880	console games. So Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 games to smart devices and dedicated hardware.
5611880	5619000	And they're also tinkering with PC game streaming as well. I don't know. That's kind of creepy.
5620840	5627160	I guess there'll be a, this will be a service for people that are, you know, GameStop power up
5627160	5633080	rewards members and that demos will be provided. And of course, the rest of the stuff, including
5633080	5639160	pricing, is not known. And it's, they're expected to have a full rollout by early next year. And,
5639160	5644600	um, or more, I guess more details about early next year and full rollout by middle of 2012.
5646520	5651480	It's interesting. Eh, I don't care because it's GameStop and I already told you my feelings on
5651480	5654680	them a few weeks ago. And if you missed that whole little rant, I am boycotting them because
5654680	5660440	I think they're a shitty company. So I kind of don't care about this whole thing. However,
5660440	5663560	I will say, let me, let me think of something nice I could say about this.
5663560	5670440	Competition is healthy. And so these sort, these, uh, places like OnLive and so forth that are
5670440	5674600	already offering something very similar, right? Uh, the competition is a healthy thing.
5675640	5681480	Uh, this is GameStop you're talking about. This is the monkey that's in, you know, the corner,
5681480	5685960	basically the elephant in the room there. They're the biggest monkey in the corner throwing poo at
5685960	5691320	itself. Yes, whatever. They're the biggest retailer for video games out there in the
5691320	5697400	marketplace right now. They dictate to publishers what they do. Um, so I don't know if it's a
5697400	5701640	comfortable thing to have them in this game streaming marketplace. Cause what you're going
5701640	5705880	to get then is, Oh, this game's gonna be exclusive to our service. This game's gonna be exclusive to
5705880	5709560	our service, you know, and so on and so forth. You're gonna get into that kind of crap because
5709560	5713080	they're like, well, we're not going to sell your game in store if you don't put it on our service.
5714360	5718040	That's what's going to be coming. So all those gonna be disgusting.
5718040	5723000	And that, that, by the way, that right there, just add that to the list of why I boys, I'm like,
5723000	5726920	if you are new to OLR and you know, I know we have a lot of people that like work at GameStops
5726920	5731400	and stuff like that. My beef is not with the workers. You guys, you guys have a thankless
5731400	5735080	job and I respect what you've got to do, what you got to do to pay the bills. My problem is
5735080	5740120	with the management of the company. If you need, uh, information about what that all entails,
5740120	5743960	look at what Loki just said, because that will probably be reality. Cause that, that's,
5743960	5749400	I mean, when it comes down to, you know, dictating, I mean, perfect example, you know,
5749400	5755000	there'll be games that come out that are street dated. Earth Defense Force, for example, you know,
5755000	5763160	and Earth Defense Force was supposed to come out on Tuesday in July. All right. D3, they fucked up.
5763160	5768680	They accidentally printed, you know, a date on the box that didn't coincide with that date that was
5768680	5774680	on the actual packaging and what they've been communicated to all the different stores. So,
5774680	5778920	whereas a regular store would go, hey, wait a second, you know, this date was wrong. And,
5778920	5783240	you know, they would contact D3 and D3 are like, oh yeah, that was a misprint. The street date is
5783240	5789320	still, you know, the day we stated GameStop said, hey, you printed a different date on here that
5789320	5793320	happens to be earlier. We're going to use that date and you don't want us to put it out. Well,
5793320	5797640	fuck you. We're just going to put it out anyways. And even though that information wasn't
5797640	5801480	communicated to all the other retailers out there, ah, fuck them. We're GameStop. We're going to put
5801480	5805880	it out anyways because you put a date on here and we're hearing to the date that you put on this,
5805880	5811000	even though it is a misprint. That's the type of company GameStop is. They will do whatever
5811000	5816520	cutthroat thing they need to do to be on top. So, if you like all the streaming services like
5816520	5825720	OnLive and stuff, well, I hope they survive. Kaijuto in chat says, why all the GameStop hate?
5825720	5829080	All they do is sell us games and they've been made buying games easier for people like me who
5829080	5833880	don't like to shop online. Remember the 80s and how much Toys R Us and mom and pop shops would
5833880	5840520	sell games an arm and a leg, 90 plus dollars. Again, I have to defer back to my earlier rant
5840520	5845000	that would have been about three or four weeks ago because I really don't want to get into it again.
5845000	5851240	But there's plenty of other options, plenty of other options. So, that's all I'm going to say
5851240	5856680	about that for now. I don't want to make things easier. I'm sorry. I mean, well, you know that
5856680	5861480	there's games sold at that store. You can buy games anywhere nowadays. I understand the allure
5861480	5867240	of retail versus buying things online. I mean, that's why, I mean, why hasn't every mall in
5867240	5871800	America closed if we can just buy our crap online? Because some people want to go see it. Like,
5871800	5876440	clothing stores are never going to be replaced with online clothing stores because let's face
5876440	5881240	it, some people need to try it on first, you know. That's just, this is a matter of fact. And with
5881240	5886280	game shopping, it's kind of a very similar story. Some people need to try it on first and, you know,
5886280	5891560	game kiosks and so forth let you do that. Ask questions which you can't do online and so on
5891560	5895640	and so forth. I'm just saying there's plenty of other retail options. GameStop as a company has
5895640	5901160	done some things to people I know that I don't like and I'm not going to support them. My choice.
5901160	5906760	And you're perfectly justified, I think. I agree.
5906760	5914840	Yep. So, let's move on to happier news, shall we? Let's talk about VidRhythm. VidRhythm is
5914840	5921000	Harmonix's new video game franchise, music franchise. And a lot of people were saying,
5921000	5924120	ooh, maybe this will be like when they heard the title because we heard the title because of a
5924120	5929080	trademark or application or one of those things before. And a lot of people were hoping, ooh,
5929080	5933400	maybe it's like a new frequency or amplitude or something like that, like VidRhythm, like videos
5933400	5941160	and stuff. Well, it turns out that the game has been announced for iOS. In a Gamasutra interview
5941160	5948520	with Alex Rogopoulos, who's the Harmonix head honcho, he says that it's for the iOS and it's
5948520	5954520	more of an app than a game. Quote, we think there are a lot of creative opportunities with
5954520	5961000	smartphones that we haven't really been able to focus on yet. So, we're looking forward to doing
5961000	5969320	more in that space. Hmm. So, it sounds like this may have something to do more so than just a game.
5969960	5975080	Maybe it has something to do with location. Maybe it has something to do with pictures or videos
5975080	5980760	that the phones can do now. Who knows? It could be interesting. I have no idea. I mean, a statement
5980760	5984840	like that could really go anywhere. Like, I don't know if it's just CEO speak blowing smoke up my
5984840	5990200	ass that they're doing something new when they're really not. It's just their take on something.
5990200	5995880	But then I go, but it's Harmonix. And Harmonix, they kind of have, I mean, Rock Band and keep in
5995880	6000840	mind, they made the original Guitar Hero with Red Octane. You know, that really was kind of
6000840	6005240	something new. And I know there's going to be the people that are like, but Guitar Freaks,
6005240	6010760	Guitar Freaks. Well, I'm sorry. They took the risk of making that more mainstream for America
6010760	6015640	that Konami refused to do time and time again. That's why Harmonix succeeded here because they
6015640	6023240	did what Konami refused to do. So, Harmonix does what Konami don't. Something like that,
6023240	6027320	but let's face it. We're, you know, we're long past that. That, that whole stuff is years old.
6027320	6035160	So now it's about what is VidRhythm. So I don't know. I VidRhythm, I don't know. I see in my mind
6035160	6038280	that when he talks about, we're trying to do things to smartphones that haven't been done,
6038280	6043160	like maybe it has something to do with location or like picture. I don't know why pictures keep
6043160	6048920	coming to my mind, but maybe somehow it has to do with pictures on your phone, get incorporated
6048920	6054360	into the game. I don't know, but that alone sounds really cheesy. So I don't know. I guess we'll see
6054360	6059400	more when the demo is out or what happens with it. Of course, if it's iOS, then it'll be one of
6059400	6063000	those things where they'll just be like, oh, it's coming out whenever Apple pushes it to the store,
6063000	6069400	which could be like tomorrow. So we'll see. All right, let's move on to the mailbag. Every week,
6069400	6075240	Dark Sakura dives into the mailbag head first and pulls out some emails that she thinks, hey,
6076360	6079640	I should read this on the air. Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
6079640	6081400	You want to know what sucks? What?
6081400	6087240	Is that, um, the window I had the mailbag open in, um, it was closed. Sorry. Hold on. Let me
6087240	6091320	reopen it. You better open that shit real fast. All right. I guess I can plug Twitter again real
6091320	6095320	quick at the end of the show. Cause we'll be doing your Twitter topics, twitter.com slash O L R.
6095880	6100120	We will be doing the Skype line later. The 800 number is back tonight. Thank you very much.
6100120	6106120	So, uh, wait for that. All right, here they are. You ready? No, I want to talk more.
6106120	6113000	Um, and by the way, I'm not going to call you person. Hey guys, thanks for the show,
6113000	6116920	particularly to Rob for posting the podcast to the feed as quick as he's doing.
6116920	6120840	It really makes a difference for those of us who are unable to listen live. At the top of the show,
6120840	6124920	there was some angst about having mobile games that just aren't optimized for various,
6126760	6131800	for the various devices they're available for. I just want to chime in with my two cents and let
6131800	6135720	you know that this is one area where Android does it better than iOS because developers can
6135720	6139880	actually segment their apps and create install packages for each group of devices they want to
6139880	6145800	offer their app for whether by OS version or hardware. So they can assure that that gamers
6145800	6151320	get the best experience they can. Best of all, I only purchased the apps once and can install it
6151320	6155800	on every device I have fully optimized. Finally, with it being an open platform, there's a bunch
6155800	6159800	of great apps for gamers who like me prefer a physical game pad, even going so far as to use a
6159800	6166280	wiimote for our games for free. A first person shooter on my zoom with the moat and nunchuck over
6166280	6171480	Bluetooth is great for traveling. I am not eagerly awaiting the inevitable update that will bring
6171480	6176520	Google plus games to Android tablets and phones. Life will be sweet when that hits. Grats again
6176520	6181720	from a plane somewhere over the great horchata filled country of Mexico sent from my zoom.
6182280	6187240	Oh my God, I haven't had an horchata in forever. I know a place that's open late that has them so
6187240	6193000	good. But from thine eyes, my knowledge I derive, which is a Shakespeare quote. He put it on there.
6193000	6199880	And that is from, um, I'm going to say Dr. Noir. Did I miss, did I miss a question in there? I
6199880	6203480	thought I heard a question about what we were talking about on that top of last week's show
6203480	6208360	about the mobile games. Um, or was it just a statement? A statement. Okay, my bad. The
6208360	6215400	Android's better. Whatever. I'm glad you think so. Last one, which is the only one. Hey, OLR,
6215400	6222440	SonicM88 here with another question for you. Wonderful folks. No. 42. Alright, fine. I'm
6222440	6227080	considering buying a few of my favorite games as downloadable games on Xbox via the games on demand
6227080	6231160	service. I'm very lazy and can totally justify the purchase because my biggest problem currently is
6231160	6237480	getting off my ass to change games. First world problems. Right? Here's the problem though. I
6237480	6242360	remember hearing stories a while back about a Tom Clancy game not being fully compatible with
6242360	6247560	multiplayer. Apparently the physical version was unable to play online multiplayer with the games
6247560	6252520	on demand downloadable version. In the Xbox marketplace, all I know of the games say is that
6252520	6257560	they don't support online multiplayer whatsoever. However, I know that's not true since I have a
6257560	6262680	friend who owns Gears of War downloadable and he claims it's completely compatible. So I want to
6262680	6267160	know if there's any website you guys know about where I can find the compatibility of these games.
6267160	6274760	Thanks guys. Try Wikipedia. Or actually I'm gonna say the official Xbox forums because when shit
6274760	6279480	like that is broken, you will hear the angry gamers and complaints on the official Xbox forum.
6279480	6283000	So all you have to do is read through one of those. I vaguely remember what you're talking
6283000	6287720	about. I want to say that was fixed though. I think they did do some type of patch. I don't
6287720	6292760	think Microsoft is intentionally leaving that shit out. But let's face it, the games on demand service
6292760	6298200	is pretty lazy. All they're doing is they're, they're kind of doing what I talked about at the
6298200	6304760	top of the show with the Wii hack. You can load the things, you load the disc into an image and
6304760	6310920	Microsoft's basically selling you that image. And it is literally the, when you take the disc and
6310920	6316040	install it to your hard drive on your 360, it's literally that image that they're selling you. But
6316040	6323400	which is fine. It's legit. It's not piracy. It's through their store. It's fine. But that's,
6323400	6329560	you know, essentially they don't do the extensive quality checks that are done when a game is first
6329560	6334600	released. Let's put it that way. They might do some minimal quality checks, but you know,
6334600	6340280	very minimal as you can see by that little story there. But those sort of instances should be few
6340280	6343560	and far between. To the best of my knowledge, those games are supposed to be playable online.
6343560	6347400	They're supposed to be just like copies of the regular games. It's not supposed to be anything
6347400	6352920	crazy or something Microsoft's locking you out of. But I will say this, you know, if you know,
6352920	6356360	it's your money. Spend it how you want. If downloading the game so you don't have to get
6356360	6362600	up and put a disc in is that important to you, then fine. Do it. But just don't be afraid to
6362600	6367560	shop smart too. And what I mean by that is don't assume that the price you see on Xbox downloadable
6367560	6372840	is necessarily the cheapest. What's more important to you? Getting up off the couch to change the
6372840	6378840	disc or getting it cheapest. You know, because you might be able to find a used copy on eBay
6379400	6384840	really cheap or possibly you could even find Amazon is having a sale or Best Buy is having
6384840	6389400	a sale. Best Buy had a great Kinect sale a couple of months ago where it was like buy one, get one
6389400	6394920	free. So, you know, always be on the lookout for things like that. I'm just going to buy. Tell me
6394920	6398680	about that. You know, but at the end of the day, again, it's your money. Spend it how you want.
6398680	6404840	And certainly I've downloaded my share of download games. Granted, that's mostly the arcade stuff.
6404840	6411400	But let me I will say this. When I had swine flu back in 09, I did. I had swine flows out of work
6411400	6417560	for nine days. I downloaded a game digitally because I was not allowed to leave my house
6417560	6422280	for my doctor. So I think in that case, I might have a legitimate reason for having done that,
6422280	6427400	you know, and I downloaded I remember I would have left my house anyway. It was it was 32nd
6427400	6432200	Hero on the P.S.P. to as many people or half minute hero, whatever it was. So yeah, who cares
6432200	6438360	about coworkers? All right. I think it's actually pretty funny. And just to make a quick mention
6439240	6446200	is that that's actually like where the source of most illness is, is from the workplace.
6448360	6454920	You know, since I have not been working, Rob, I've only been sick, like really sick once.
6454920	6461400	Yeah, I know. It's crazy. Quarantined here in the safety of my home.
6462600	6466840	All right. Let's move on. Since that was the end of the email bag, right?
6466840	6470360	Yes, it was. We need more emails. Two, two emails. That was,
6470360	6472440	that was a sad showing. If I get ten emails next week,
6472440	6475000	Rob has to get me an Orchata. I'm not going to do shit.
6475000	6478920	Okay. Well, that's because you're not here. And the week after, if we have ten emails the week
6478920	6483400	after, then I will get Rob an Orchata. Okay, now we're talking.
6483400	6490040	And then Rob will get me an Orchata. Okay. Ten emails means Orchata trading
6490040	6490920	happens. Yes.
6492680	6496840	Actually, it'll just be Mexican drink night here at Orange Lounge Radio.
6496840	6499480	You can get a Tamarindo. I'll go get some Jarritos.
6500920	6506280	And I will get Orchata and then we can have some, what's that, apple soda?
6506280	6512840	That's what I'm thinking of, I think. No, the Jarritos makes the tamarind soda.
6512840	6514200	Yeah. And they have,
6514200	6519240	I think the same company makes an apple soda and they have like a lime soda.
6519240	6521240	And we'll go to Target and get. And they have a sangria.
6521240	6524040	We'll go to Target and we'll get the Coke that's actually from Mexico
6524840	6527160	that has like the real sugar in it. And it's kosher.
6528360	6529320	Passover. There you go. So,
6531320	6536920	and then, then we'll drink lots of tequila. So, ten emails for Mexican drink night at,
6536920	6542120	for a fiesta in studio here at Orange Lounge Radio. All right.
6544680	6548840	We got to get to the FUs of the week. Every week on the show we get a little bit angsty
6548840	6567880	and we have to share our angst with you all. Why? Because we can.
6567880	6572520	FU to Northrend. First world problems.
6572520	6579080	Uh, Loki. Uh, FVDAC Vision for putting on a game called
6579080	6587320	Skylanders Spyro's Adventure. Skylanders is, first off, a really terrible Spyro game.
6589000	6591880	Just Spyro isn't what he used to be. I mean, come on.
6591880	6596280	But to make things more complicated, they're trying to make this game like
6596280	6602840	the must have item for Christmas. So, it's got toys with it. Thirty different collectible toys.
6602840	6605560	All different things at the set up. Different three packs of toys.
6605560	6609160	Different adventure sets of toys. And they're like, oh, well, it's like download content,
6609160	6614520	but it's physical. You know what these download content or physical download content pieces cost?
6614520	6619640	Eight dollars. Eight dollars for a toy that does nothing. It is literally a figurine is about
6619640	6625480	two inches tall. It does nothing. It doesn't move. It doesn't do anything other than activate
6625480	6633640	activated character in a game. So, why kids would buy that or parents would buy that instead of,
6633640	6639880	I don't know, a Mario game or I don't know, any other toy out there on the market is beyond me.
6639880	6646440	And on top of all that, they want to sell this thing starting off at $70. $70 for a Wii game,
6646440	6652600	PS3 game, 360 game, because it comes with some bullshit toys that weren't really toys.
6652600	6656120	What would you like to see sell more? Tickle Me Elmo or this thing?
6656120	6660440	Anything. Anything other than this. And you know what? I predict right now that this is going to
6660440	6667080	be as big of a failure as Tony Hawk Shred, Tony Hawk Ride, and sadly enough, DJ Hero 2.
6667080	6669720	So, meaning like a year and a half later, I'll be able to get them for $10?
6669720	6675480	Oh, yes. Yes. I really wish I could have gotten some of those Renegade or the
6676120	6680280	bundles with all the stuff. You know what's even better with that stuff? Flip it on fucking eBay.
6680280	6684840	For, you know, you can make more than $10 off that. Hell, you know what you could do with that
6684840	6689080	kind of stuff? If you got, you know, the extra turntables and stuff? You could flip it to Game
6689080	6694760	Stop and make more than $10 off of that if you really wanted to go that route. But I mean,
6694760	6699720	that's just money in the bag right there. But yes, it will not sell very well. Because you know
6699720	6704360	why? Because there's a lot of kids games coming out this holiday and, you know, with Mario and
6704360	6710600	stuff on the 3DS and on the console systems, everything else in Call of Duty, no one's gonna
6710600	6718040	give a shit about Spyro, a character that was popular 10 years ago. I think we have some Spyro
6718040	6722840	fans in chat. I've seen them before, but it is still a big buy-in to ask of them. I understand
6722840	6727960	that you may be Spyro fans, but take a look at the new Spyro. This is not Spyro from 10 years ago.
6727960	6735080	This is like, we made Spyro angry and emo, is what it is. It's just cashing in on the Spyro
6735080	6741400	franchise. That's why it's Skylanders Spyro Adventures. It's not Spyro blah, blah, blah.
6742120	6750040	It's Skylanders with Spyro, basically. You done? I'm done. Oh, finally. All right, uh,
6750840	6757080	my view of the week goes to Peanut Butter Pinkberry, because you guys, it's so good. Like,
6757080	6762200	they do one where they put strawberry jam on it and toasted bread crumbs, and oh my God,
6762200	6766360	oh my God, it's so good. But here's why I give it an FU, because, well, A, it's good,
6766360	6771640	and B, it's not non-fat or low-fat. Every other flavor in Pinkberry's history has been like
6771640	6777640	non-fat or low-fat, but this one? Extra fat. Extra fat. Seven grams of fat a serving, which,
6777640	6783480	you know, ice cream's worse, but still, that's a little disappointing. Special occasions only.
6783480	6789000	I know, this is a real problem, right? All right, there it is, FUs of the Week. More news stories
6789000	6795400	for you guys, and then the Skype line is about five stories away. So Ubisoft is apparently
6795400	6803240	trying to pull a THQ and put out a tablet peripheral for, I guess, the Wii. It looks
6803240	6808680	like it's supposed to be for the Wii. It's a, right now they're kind of a, it's a work in
6808680	6814280	progress thing, a project in touch, and they have an internal marketing video that's been
6814920	6823160	found leaked out there. Basically, they have some sort of a tablet that's gonna be used to
6823160	6826360	play games and stuff. It's basically all the same stuff that you see right now with the UDraw.
6829000	6834920	I don't know. It's interesting, I guess. I don't know, UDraw's doing all right,
6834920	6839320	but I don't know if there's really room on the market for multiple tablet peripherals.
6840200	6845880	I was gonna say, UDraw's done quite well for a third-party peripheral. Usually those don't do
6845880	6851080	too hot. I mean, the last, you know, well, okay, you got a Guitar Hero and that whole thing did
6851080	6855080	well. DDR pads did pretty good, but you know, there's a lot of peripherals that come out the
6855080	6860200	tank too, like the skateboard thing. That tank's pretty hardcore. Yeah, unfortunately.
6860200	6869240	So it's hard to convince people to buy more plastic shit and a hundred dollar skateboard
6869240	6873800	for a game that, you know, it's really going to be the only game that's going to support it,
6873800	6878200	or two games. So why is UDraw succeeded and where this one is trying to get some of this
6878200	6884040	success? Well, UDraw succeeded because they've got a lot of different games that come out for it.
6884040	6891320	Right now they have, I think it's about five games right now that support it, and there's a lot more
6891320	6896520	coming out this fall. Plus there's going to be more UDraw stuff on other systems. You get it on
6896520	6902680	the Playstation 3 and 360 as well this year. And on top of that, besides the licensed stuff that
6902680	6909320	THQ's done, like with Spongebob and their Marvel stuff, they've got now licenses from other
6909320	6915720	companies like Disney Princess stuff. And actually there's going to be a Mickey drawing program or
6915720	6920120	something like that. Disney animation program. Gosh, that sounds like fun. That would be kind
6920120	6924520	of cool. So, you know, they're getting other companies to support this kind of thing. So
6924520	6928840	Ubisoft, I'm sure if you played your cards right and talked to THQ, they would probably let you
6928840	6934040	make a game for, you know, the UDraw tablet. Save yourself a whole bunch of time. Instead,
6934040	6938440	you're going to put out this other peripheral. Now why would they do that? Why would they do
6938440	6942920	that? Exactly. Why would you concede to another company to make it a lot easier for yourself when
6942920	6945880	you can just make something that'll fail on your own? And you can just fucking steamroll with all
6945880	6950680	your franchises. Yeah. Well, why would we bother publishing with the UDraw when we can make our
6950680	6956440	own and take the market from UDraw? It's just, I don't think there's really going to be a market
6956440	6963000	for it, but we'll see. Whatever. They've tried to think outside the box with different stuff.
6963000	6968520	I mean, remember, it was the last E3, they had a bunch of games that weren't really games. Like,
6968520	6977080	they had some sort of relaxation program or something like that where you basically...
6978360	6987320	It was basically the... What was it? The... That stupid Wii peripheral that they had that they
6987320	6991560	never put out. I don't remember the hell it was. The Vitality Sensor. It was basically the Vitality
6991560	6996440	Sensor but on the PC. And they had that come out and they had some laser tag game come out that
6996440	7002280	wasn't really a game. It was just something ran on the PC that... It was basically laser tag a toy.
7002280	7010760	And they had one other thing that was kind of along the lines of that. But yeah, they're
7010760	7018680	definitely trying some unique stuff over there at Ubisoft. All right. Well, we'll see if it
7018680	7022760	works for them. I don't know. I think flooding the market with too much of this similar shit
7022760	7027240	is going to end up being a bad thing, but we'll see. Anyhow, there's been rumors going around
7027240	7032840	forever that Diablo 3, big PC release coming out later this year, big rumor for the longest time
7032840	7037240	that it'll probably end up on consoles as well. Well, let's just fan the flames of that fire
7037240	7042760	because during a Gamescom press conference this week, Josh Mosquera, who's the lead designer
7042760	7048760	behind Diablo 3, said that Blizzard is, quote, very, very serious about bringing the Diablo 3 experience
7048760	7054200	to the console. The company is, quote, trying to build the best console team at Blizzard.
7054760	7059000	Now, they're not saying what game they're working on, but you can expect it's probably Diablo or
7059000	7063720	it's the new MMO. You know, that would be ironic if that was the case because, you know, in Diablo 3,
7063720	7068040	don't you have to be connected to the internet the whole time to play the game? Yes. But the
7068040	7076680	console version, you probably wouldn't have to be. That's maybe or maybe not true. That could be
7076680	7080520	a sticking point for why it's not on the consoles right now. I would think that whole real money
7080520	7086280	trade auction house is what's holding things up, especially when it comes to Xbox 360. I could not
7086280	7091480	see that shit flying on the 360 without Microsoft getting a cut of that somehow. Although, then again,
7091480	7096280	to have Diablo 3 on their console would be a pretty big score for them. It would have to be online
7096280	7102680	only, and if not, that thing would get hacked apart. Maybe they're gonna keep it separate from
7102680	7107320	the PC one somehow. That's true. They could do that without the real money auction house. Yep.
7107880	7115640	So, we will see. But for now, that's all we know. More rumors to fuel those fires. So,
7116200	7119800	I don't care. I'm still getting Diablo 3 just because I was such a sucker for the first one,
7119800	7126840	so whatever. I don't think I am. Aw, sad face. I never got into the other Diablo games. So,
7127800	7131160	all right. Well, let's move on. Dark Soccer, you got more news for us, right?
7132600	7140040	Well, it's Square actually. Square Enix. We can't call them Square Enix anymore, I don't think.
7140680	7146680	They've filed a new trademark that's just Square. So, who knows? Maybe they'll be going back to
7146680	7153000	Square, which actually makes sense because I'm gonna use this as an example. The company that
7153000	7160520	I used to work for when I was doing student loans, we were Educaid. When Wachovia purchased the
7160520	7166760	company, they've actually purchased First Union, which owned Educaid and the money store and all
7166760	7172920	that. But we had to brand ourselves as Educaid Wachovia, and then after a while, we became
7172920	7181880	Wachovia Student Services or whatever. But it's the same thing, I think. Now that they've got
7181880	7191160	Square and Enix in everybody's head, they're gonna rebrand back to Square. It makes perfect sense.
7191160	7195800	Well, I also think of, remember when there was G4 and then there was Tech TV,
7195800	7200920	and then there was G4 Tech TV, and then it was like chomp, and now it's just G4 again.
7200920	7206360	Yeah, it's just part of rebranding. With any acquisition, especially with a big company,
7206360	7211000	something that's well known, you have to merge your branding so that people will start associating
7211000	7217080	one with the other. I'm still sad to see the name Enix go away because now we'll never get another
7217080	7224440	bust to move. We might, but it won't say Enix on it. That's true. That's okay. I'll just bust out
7224440	7231240	my other two bust moves. Play them. Alright, so we'll see what happens with that. Couple more
7231240	7236680	stories for you guys, then we're gonna get to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR. But not just yet,
7236680	7243720	Loki's got a story for us. Yeah, there's some interesting stuff on the PlayStation Network
7243720	7250360	front. They're actually gonna start offering some cheaper rentals for different movies and TV shows.
7250360	7256680	99 cent movie and TV rentals are coming, and right now they've got a really small list of what's
7256680	7261880	gonna be available. I guess every Tuesday a selection of movies and TV rentals will see a
7261880	7271480	discount of 99 cents for the SD versions and $1.99 for HD. I believe this week was Sicko,
7271480	7280840	The Longshots, Salvage, Tony, Shank, Bonded by Blood, JFK, Reckless Youth Part 1 and Part 2,
7280840	7294920	Deadly Blessing, Carver, Devil in the Flesh, and Illuminating Angels and Demons. That was what was
7294920	7298440	on there. So they're gonna be discounting stuff each week. That's kind of neat, I guess, to drive
7298440	7304840	a little bit more sales in that category. Especially maybe they compete a little bit with
7306120	7311480	Redbox and Netflix. Yeah, but the stuff they're offering is crap. Have you looked at what's on
7311480	7317800	the list? It's all a bunch of crap. But hey, you know what? Something cheaper is still better than
7317800	7321480	nothing cheaper. I still don't see how any of that stuff's really a better value than Netflix,
7321480	7325400	although I guess Netflix is kind of challenged for a lot of content and may continue to be
7325400	7330120	challenged over the next year or what have you. But I don't know. Like I was looking. One of my
7330120	7335720	friends uses that Vudu site and I kind of saw that for the first time over the weekend. And I don't
7335720	7340440	know. It seemed too expensive for me. I was like, dang, they want too much money for all these
7340440	7344600	rentals of old stuff. I don't know. I guess everything seems expensive next to Netflix
7344600	7349320	where you're paying the one fee for the whole month, you know? Yeah, I don't know. It's just me.
7349320	7356280	All right. One other story for you guys, and this has to do with Portal 2. Of course you love Portal
7356280	7363240	2, right, DarkSakura? Yeah. DarkSakura speaks for all the... Yeah. Well, Portal 2, you know,
7363240	7367160	we were supposed to be getting download content. Where the hell is it? It was supposed to be here
7367160	7374680	in the summer and it's still not here. Put his house down. Apparently, it's going to be happening
7374680	7380280	in September. September is when the download content will be coming out. And they are saying
7380280	7385160	it's free. So if you're like all huffy and puffy about the fact that the download content still is
7385160	7389080	now, you know what? Good things come to those who wait. They have not said what the download
7389080	7395480	content might include. And all that's being said about it is that Valve's Doug Lombardi
7395480	7402600	apparently said, quote, it's still technically summer. Which he does have a point, right?
7402600	7409480	Fall doesn't really start until what? September 21st? So technically it is still summer in early
7409480	7414600	September. So fine. That's the dorkiest thing I've ever heard. You win on this technicality.
7414600	7421000	You better have it out or we're sending more protesters out to protest in front of Valve
7421000	7427960	because that's the thing people do these days. All right. I guess that's going to do it for
7427960	7435480	news tonight. And we're going to go to the Skype line. 1-877-GAME-OLR. Our username on Skype is
7435480	7443400	OrangeLoungeRadio. And we're going to take your calls throughout the night. It's open now. I'm
7443400	7447880	going to also get to the Twitter and try to splice in some Twitter topics in between here,
7448440	7452360	which I didn't load up in advance because I was not planning well tonight. But again,
7452360	7459240	that's Twitter.com slash OLR. It's the show where every gamer has a voice and we welcome that
7459240	7465480	through the phones or through our Twitter. Or of course, there's always the chat room if you're
7465480	7471000	like, you know, I don't have a Twitter or I'm too lazy to call or what have you. Our tweeter brings
7471000	7477480	all the calls. You can always do it that way. And it's like damn right my call quality is better
7477480	7485720	than yours. What? I don't know. All right. Let's see. Trying to go to some of the tweets here
7487160	7495400	from earlier in the week. We got wished a happy third tw-birthday. Nice. By who?
7497160	7502840	A tw-birthday or some account. I don't know. It's probably a spam account. Who knows? All
7502840	7506760	right. Let's go to the phone. You've been on Twitter a while. Have a dollar. Hey, you're
7506760	7510200	on Orange House Radio. Who's this? It's Death Wishing. Oh my God. I can see you.
7511400	7518280	Yeah, you can. Thank God you have a shirt on. What's up? I'm playing Eve Online. What's Eve?
7518280	7523640	Okay. I've never played Eve Online before. What's Eve Online like? Space cowboy with
7523640	7533240	tons of space rocks and mining and just people being assholes. I mean, I can give you an example.
7533240	7537320	It's a lot harder than World of Warcraft. And it's a lot better in my opinion,
7537320	7540520	because you can pretty much do whatever you want. You don't have to follow your class guideline.
7542360	7546040	The customization, they recently also just released an expansion where you can walk around
7546040	7551560	the stations, which is also going to work, build it into the game Dust 514. If you also heard of
7551560	7555240	that, which I kind of want to talk about. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Let's talk about that a
7555240	7560120	little bit. Cause I did hear about that at E3 and it sounded really exciting. What's this all about?
7560120	7564440	Well, think of, you know, the game PlanetSide and did you ever play it?
7566680	7573240	No. Well, Dust is a first-person shooter. Hold on. I got to put my glasses on. That
7574920	7580360	is going to be pretty much just like PlanetSide, but for the PS3 only the PS3, which is weird,
7580360	7585560	but it's going to tie into Eve Online where basically it will work as in corporations,
7585560	7590200	the player run corporations that are on Eve Online will be able to hire mercenaries from
7590200	7595480	the PlayStation 3 to fight over planets in the Eve universe, which basically they will fight over
7595480	7598760	minerals, blah, blah, whatever the hell's on the planet. It could be just a pile of shit. I don't
7598760	7607720	know. And basically corporations will buy us the PlayStation 3 users all their weaponry, all their
7607720	7614040	tanks and stuff. So basically if you, the plate, the PC users supply the their mercenary corporation,
7614040	7620120	they earn pretty much unlimited wealth. And that's what Dust is. And Eve Online is really hard to
7620120	7626920	explain. All I can say is, is it's hard. What makes it so, what makes it so rewarding to be
7626920	7632120	playing the game? Because it's, I don't know, it's just unlike everything in this game is basically
7632120	7636360	player run. They have player run banks that people make real spreadsheets and stuff where you put
7636360	7640680	your in-game money like, and it works exactly like a real bank building interest, taking out
7640680	7645640	loans and stuff like that. But then, as you would think, there's also people that scan that system.
7645640	7651000	Like, I think a couple months ago, there was a guy who made a bank, made it for two years, got about
7651000	7656120	870 billion isk, transferred all that money to another account, closed his account down, and all
7656120	7659640	of the users were complaining that they lost money, right? Right. The freaking corporation
7659640	7665240	just told them, or the CCP who runs the game said, welcome to the game, don't trust people.
7665240	7672600	Don't trust people. And it doesn't hold your hand like World of Warcraft. Did I say that?
7672600	7675160	Yeah, you did mention that a little bit, I think so.
7675160	7681400	Yeah, it's hard to explain, but I don't know. Also, I want to say that I hate Activision.
7682200	7683400	Why do you hate Activision?
7683400	7686120	Because the guy who runs the company is such an asshole.
7686120	7687240	Bobby Kotick?
7687240	7691880	Yeah, he ruins like game series. He's ruined Tony Hawk, he ruined Call of Duty, and now he's
7691880	7700120	gonna be here in Spyro. What fuckery set you off this week? Besides jobs, um, Activision.
7701480	7704200	I think there's a bit of personal bitterness here to this. I don't know if this-
7704200	7706680	I'm just an angry person, an angry college kid.
7707960	7710360	You're just an angry listener, an angry gamer.
7711480	7716440	Yes. I usually have more to talk about, but I'm actually a boring person this week. I'm kind of
7716440	7718280	on a recovery day.
7718280	7723960	Sorry, let me read this tweet for a recovery day. Was Burning Man this week or something?
7725800	7727800	Don't worry about it. What were you gonna say?
7727800	7729960	Alright, fine. Tigerclaw says,
7729960	7736360	EVE Online is by far the most hardcore- hardest core game in its existence. Agree?
7736360	7741400	I totally agree. Especially since my corporation got attacked last week and we lost like 500
7741400	7742440	million. So.
7743000	7743720	Yikes.
7743720	7748040	Which, um, yeah. I can also say one thing. A lot of the money in the game amounts to real money,
7748040	7753160	so like there's ships that cost- they're called Titan class ships. $10,000 real currency.
7755400	7756680	They're just throwing that out there.
7756680	7758520	$10,000 in real currency.
7758520	7759160	Real currency.
7759800	7761320	And people buy it.
7761320	7766120	360 million is $15 a currency, which you can use the currency that you make in-game to buy
7766120	7767960	your in-game subscription.
7767960	7771960	Right, right. I've heard of that. You can buy these cards or something that you use, right?
7772760	7777320	Like, was there a big story where they blew up a big carrier that was carrying a bunch of
7777320	7779240	those cards and like all this game time was just lost?
7779240	7784200	Yeah, I forgot what it was. I think it was some player who was really retarded. I believe
7784200	7789400	you can put that stuff in your, uh, like a hangar. And he was retarded and kept it around
7789400	7794200	and went for him for god knows why. So people heard about it, killed him, took game time.
7794840	7795720	Your fault.
7795720	7800680	Yikes. All right. Well, Deathwishing, we're going to let you go, but thanks for the call.
7800680	7805640	And thanks for the webcam. It's interesting to see our listeners there. So we're not
7805640	7807640	hooking one up so you can see us though. All right.
7807640	7810200	I'm not fat. Don't worry about it.
7810200	7812040	All right. Take care. All right. All right. Later.
7812040	7813160	Mine rock time. Bye.
7816600	7820440	I want to see more. Well, maybe, maybe that's something I don't want to wish. Maybe I don't
7820440	7824200	want to see more of the listeners, but, uh, yeah, sure. Why not call us with your webcams?
7824200	7824760	It'll be fun.
7824760	7826280	We want to see the sexy ones.
7826280	7831320	All right. Now the 877 number is apparently broken, but there is a back door you can use.
7831320	7838200	916-226-9067. I want to point out that is not a toll free number. So if you don't have
7838200	7842600	like a cell phone that has free nationwide long distance, that number will not work.
7842600	7845480	It looks like someone's using that number right now. Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio. Who's this?
7846600	7848600	It's Shane, the Kletov, whatever.
7848600	7852920	Hey, what's up, me Kletov? Again, I want to clarify. 877. I don't know. It's like,
7852920	7857320	I'm having problems with the phone constantly last week and now this week. 877 number will not work.
7857320	7861080	Something's up with the toll free forwarder. You can use the back door.
7861080	7868600	A 916-226-9067. Please only use that if you have free long distance, which a lot of cell
7868600	7874280	phone companies do, but be very, very careful. All right. Uh, me Kletov, what's on your mind?
7875640	7877000	Um, nothing.
7878920	7880200	So you're just calling to say hey?
7881880	7889000	No. Um, I meant to call him last week, but, um, I have a little anecdote that leads into a
7889000	7892120	kind of stance I'm taking, I think. All right, let's hear it.
7893000	7900040	Okay. So, uh, last week I was at work and we were doing a blood drive. Um, so I go get blood even
7900040	7905800	though technically legally I'm not allowed to because laws are stupid. But, um, so I'm sitting
7905800	7911320	there giving blood, being all bored and I bust out my phone and start playing some games on my phone
7911320	7915640	and I'm having a really good time. Makes the time pass super quick. And then I'm, I'm starting to
7915640	7922120	think about this, like, you know, I play games on my phone when I'm giving blood. I play games on my
7922120	7927800	phone when I'm like waiting at the drive through to pick up food or order or whatever. I play games
7927800	7933960	at work when I am in the back, uh, looking for stuff or quote unquote looking for stuff, uh, to
7933960	7942760	put out. And it hits me that I feel like the mobile phone games now are really what's portable gaming
7942760	7949400	that that's like the definition and like things like the Vita, the PSP, the DS too big, too bulky
7949400	7955640	to really be portable systems. And I really begin to realize that I only use those portably if I'm
7955640	7963400	like on a plane, otherwise I'm playing my portable systems at home. And I think that Nintendo and
7963400	7971480	Sony are gonna find themselves in the same sort of mindset after a few years. Cause you know what,
7971480	7976440	you know what, those things are just too big and bulky and the iPhone and the Android phone,
7976440	7982680	their games are just way more accessible for your portable gaming nowadays. You know, it's interesting
7982680	7986360	that you bring that up because Nintendo has been under a lot of pressure from their investors,
7986360	7991480	especially after 3DS has not done so hot and they've had to slice or slice the cost of that.
7991480	7995320	Um, Nintendo has been under a lot of pressure to basically develop iOS games is what their
7995320	7999800	investors want them to do. And, uh, you know, Satoru Iwata is very staunchly against that,
7999800	8004520	which, you know, Nintendo creating a Mario game for another system is damn near unheard of,
8004520	8008120	except of course, I'm sure a lot of people are gonna jump in and say, but what about the 3DO?
8008120	8012200	Well, okay. You all saw how well that worked out, right? So that's why Nintendo-
8012200	8012680	CDI.
8013400	8018840	I'm sorry. CDI. My bad. It was one of those 90s CD based systems. So, okay, fine. The CDI.
8019400	8022200	Clearly that didn't work out well for them. They got fucking burned on that.
8022200	8025720	I don't think they created it. They just licensed the character out.
8025720	8029960	Well, still though, it just goes to show you how they're very protective of their shit and
8029960	8033800	they don't want to do that. But you know, Nintendo already kind of tested the waters
8033800	8039160	with that though. In Japan, they have that Pokemon trading card Riven game on the iPhone.
8039160	8042760	The Pokemon company has tested, but that's not Nintendo themselves.
8043400	8047160	That's Nintendo's brand. I mean, Pokemon is, I mean, yeah, it's a Pokemon company,
8047160	8051880	but you're not gonna see Pokemon go over to Vita or Xbox.
8051880	8055000	So you do bring up an interesting point though, is that the only place a lot of people tend
8055000	8058120	to play their portable gaming systems is at home. And that's kind of where I do a lot
8058120	8062360	of my portable gaming too. Like, I have my 3DS kind of by my bed and maybe like when
8062360	8066040	it's, you know, bedtime, quote unquote, and I go into bed and maybe I'll stay up for
8066040	8070040	about 20 minutes and play the 3DS, you know? That's where I tend to do most of my portable
8070040	8070520	gaming.
8071400	8075400	Well, and you know, at E3 this year, I had my, I had my PSP, which stayed in my hotel
8075400	8082280	room. I had my 3DS, which I used to get street pass tags and then play the little mini dungeon
8082280	8087400	game because I did not have time, even when standing in line or not timed, I was not really
8087400	8092440	comfortable holding that thing in my hand, playing some game that's in depth. Had I had
8092440	8097560	something like Tiny Tower, I would have been all over my phone at that point and I probably
8097560	8101960	would have needed to bring like a charger or something with me.
8101960	8107320	I, I use my 3DS a lot at Disneyland and a lot of that has to, well, at least the last
8107320	8111960	time I was there, I had the 3DS. I take, I took two trips since I've had my 3DS because
8111960	8115800	I did really quick back-to-back trips back around Memorial Day and I took my 3DS both
8115800	8120120	times and I, I street pass with a shit ton of people at Disneyland. In fact, I, I, I
8120120	8124040	made a Twitter friend of a street passing, you know, it's just kind of funny how that
8124040	8127800	whole thing works. And yeah, the dude that's a Twitter friend of mine is apparently some
8127800	8131160	type of developer for Disney related stuff. So it's kind of, it's just really hilarious
8131160	8136120	how that all works out. So, um, what did you do the street pass for? Did you do it to do
8136120	8142120	that stupid, uh, fill in the puzzles or did you do it to do the stupid, like somewhat
8142120	8149080	of an RPG? You can do both when you street pass. When you meet a character and they go,
8149080	8153080	hello, it gives you their little URL. But yeah, well I was also street passing for Street
8153080	8157400	Fighter 4 data and now I'll be street passing for Ridge Racer 3DS data. I want more ghosts
8157400	8161560	to race against. I, I think there's a lot of really interesting things they can do with
8161560	8165560	street pass. I just don't think any of the games out right now really sell that stuff
8165560	8169320	very well, but I'm interested to see what, you know, future games can kind of think up
8169320	8174760	with the street passing. That's very interesting to me. But, um, you know, I, I'm not to say
8174760	8180280	I'm totally disagreeing with you because I think, you know, part of the reason the 3DS
8180280	8185080	isn't selling does have to do with the fact that mobile phones are doing it in some ways
8185080	8191240	better, definitely cheaper. And, uh, I, I think the price of portable games needs to
8191240	8197560	come down to stay competitive with, uh, iOS games. I think charging 40 bucks for 3DS game
8197560	8200840	isn't going to fly. And I think they're going to be in for a rude awakening pretty soon.
8200840	8204600	If they can't get that price down to 20 bucks, kiss it goodbye.
8206360	8211960	Yeah. I mean, I look at my portable games I'm playing right now. I pick up Zelda since
8211960	8218440	it's launch, maybe once every week and a half. And then I bust out my phone to play, uh,
8218440	8223000	Groove Coaster or Tiny Tower or Juke Beat, which I actually like a lot.
8223000	8225320	Ew. Juke Beat's terrible.
8226360	8227000	Oh, I love it.
8227000	8230760	I'm sorry. Did you download any of the, did you download any of the
8230760	8232680	download content stuff for Juke Beat?
8233480	8237960	No, because they're all terrible sounding. I'm not going to listen to crappy songs.
8237960	8243960	See? But that's just to start. The three that they have you begin with are awesome. I love
8243960	8246360	that Contra song. And even the Frogger song is pretty good.
8246360	8250280	I'll give you that. The Contra and Frogger songs are kind of cool. Kinda.
8250280	8257640	And it is really too hard, but it's still better than what I'm playing on my 3DS. And
8257640	8262760	my PSP is just a DJ Max console. That's all I use it for. And there's no new ones coming
8262760	8265320	out right now for that. So it's gathering.
8265320	8268760	I'm playing Tiny Tower right now while you're trying to talk. Like I'm half paying attention
8268760	8273160	to you. I'm half restocking all my stores. Because now Bobby had to go and make it a
8273160	8274680	contest. What?
8276280	8278040	I said I was doing that. And then I called in.
8279080	8280760	And then you go right back to it.
8281640	8285320	Yeah. That then, wow. I'm just like, oh, I'm flying somewhere. Well, I got to check on
8285320	8289640	my, my supplies, make sure everything's stocked up. And I just upgraded my elevator. So it's
8289640	8293560	going faster. And I love it. Like it changed the game completely for me.
8293560	8302280	There you go. All right. So, um, you, uh, you, uh, are thinking that mobile phone gaming
8302280	8307800	is where it's at. Now that being said, I remember during the E3 shows, you were all over the
8307800	8313880	Vita and you were very excited about the Vita. So even though you're saying this about mobile
8313880	8316440	gaming, you're like, ah, but I'll still get a Vita at the end of the day.
8317320	8322120	Yeah. Cause I don't foresee me going outside and busting out my Vita and playing Uncharted
8322120	8327000	because that is not a game, honestly, that you want portable. That is a, I want to sit
8327000	8333000	down and experience this awesome game with best headphones and all sorts of, you know,
8333000	8337800	being comfortable. It's not, I want to stand on a bus or in a subway playing Uncharted.
8338280	8341560	Um, one more comment from Chad, I got to let you guys, we can get some more calls,
8341560	8345560	but cause you don't in the chat room says phones are not killing the 3DS. It's the lack of anything
8345560	8349400	on the 3DS that's killing it. And I kind of tend to agree. That's really the 3DS, the biggest
8349400	8354360	problem. But I also think the price of the games is really an issue. I mean, I think it's more of
8354360	8359080	an issue than Nintendo wants to admit. I realize games are expensive to make, but there has to come
8359080	8363720	a point where you go, we're not selling these games at $40. We have to cut the price to get
8363720	8368600	these to sell. And maybe we'll sell three times as much. No, go ahead.
8369160	8374200	I really hope that this price cut and then realizing how bad the system is doing
8374200	8380040	forces them to make an actual real honest to goodness, 3d Pokemon game. That's not some
8380040	8385880	spin-off like the new one in Japan. Cause I mean, that would get me to buy four more systems,
8385880	8389800	even though I have one. I find like getting that red one too, just to have a red one,
8389800	8395640	just to have a funny red one. Yeah. I had a red and a blue SP when they came out. So I can do a
8395640	8405080	red and a blue 3DS. I decided keeping up with what I do, which is buy things I don't need.
8405080	8409000	All right. Well, I'm going to let you go so we can get some more calls. All right.
8409880	8412920	All right. Sounds good. Thanks for the call. No problem.
8412920	8421320	Later. All right. Give us a call at area code 916-226-9067. Again, not toll free. The toll
8421320	8425480	free number's down right now or call us on Skype. That's always free orange lounge radio, all one
8425480	8433000	word on Skype. Um, I'll get to the Twitter topics in just a moment here. Um, let's see, I'm trying
8433000	8437400	to get through some of these here. Um, trying to get through the feedback for last week's show and
8437400	8442440	so forth. Um, what is this? I'm just trying to see if this is a story we've already covered.
8444520	8449800	Uh, no, this is something that Eric RPG tweeted us, and this is about Nintendo 3DS. Could a new
8449800	8455800	Fire Emblem game be on its way to the Nintendo 3DS? Uh, apparently a online gaming site called
8455800	8461160	the Magic Box posted that a new Fire Emblem game will be announced by Nintendo fairly soon.
8461160	8465480	Apparently it's called Fire Emblem Blue Sacred Sword and Red Demon Lance.
8465480	8469480	Supposed to be a hundred years after Sealed Sword and the story will center around the Princess of
8469480	8474760	Kingdom Burn and the Prince of Kingdom Lycia, and each will have a different story in their
8474760	8480040	perspective. There will also be a new casual mode for beginners and lunatic mode for advanced
8480040	8485640	players. No word on where this information is coming from, but, uh, sounds good enough to me.
8485640	8489640	I don't know. Fire Emblem on 3DS seems like a logical next step, don't you think?
8489640	8496360	It sounds like an educated guess to me. All right. All right. Uh, Spazernator PSN tweets us
8496360	8501000	saying, uh, OLR, could you please say hi to your newest listener, Shirley in Arizona, please?
8501000	8506840	Shirley. Shirley, we will. Hi. You just did, right? Yeah. All right. And I'm sure that's a
8506840	8512200	pun that Shirley is terribly sick of hearing. All right, let's go to the phones and get more calls.
8512200	8516120	Hi, you're on our sauce radio with this. Spudger Zaku here. Hey, Zaku, what's on your mind?
8516840	8521880	Uh, nothing much. Just trying to recover from Ramna's barbecue he held at his place yesterday.
8523640	8527960	What's this all about? What was happening at the barbecue? Uh, bacon wrapped sausage,
8527960	8532600	a lot of food, a lot of, like, raunchy card games. We were just, like,
8533480	8537320	and drawing, uh, and using Sharpies against other people while they were passed out.
8539160	8546200	Like Jigglypuff. Yes, exactly like that. Oh, God, I can't believe it. You'll probably fill you in
8546200	8554200	on the details. Anyways, so, they were mentioning Activision being the new devil, like, in the
8554200	8560440	previous last two. I don't think they're the new devil. They've been the devil for at least a good
8560440	8567400	year. Well, I mean, I know that's still debatable, but I mean, they're like, I don't know, it's like
8567400	8572280	EA is starting to get to go back into the dark side, but then again, they've been doing pretty
8572280	8577800	well ever since going away from it. It doesn't matter staying, staying in that point where
8577800	8583000	you're making money, but you don't piss off the fan base like Activision does by just shoveling
8583000	8589560	out crap. Like, I mean, you know, the way I see it right now is that Activision's trying to make
8589560	8597160	amends by doing dedicated servers on, for Modern Warfare 3, but God knows what the, what restrictions
8597160	8601240	they will have. Like, we don't know whether they're just going to be, like, rented servers,
8601240	8605800	or there's better, or it's like a full no strings attached ones, like, you know, like in Call of
8605800	8612280	Duty 4. Someone's like, when Activision tries to throw out something like that, I don't even think
8612280	8617400	it's like, I don't even think it's them being genuine about it, just them trying to capitalize,
8618360	8623080	trying to sweep, trying to bury all the transgressions that they did in the past.
8623080	8629400	They're just trying to bury it, trying to like, you know, kiss and make up. And that right there
8629400	8633560	is just like, it's not really sincere. Well, it's a company, and of course they're not sincere.
8634440	8641160	No, I understand, but when they treated, but if you remember how that whole Modern Warfare 2 on PC,
8641160	8646120	that whole thing went out, how that whole thing panned out, where they got rid of the dedicated
8646120	8651880	servers, and you see a bunch of folks just like, they basically, they were, you know, they said,
8651880	8656440	to hell with Activision, it's not worth it. I was one of them. I was this, you know, I was really
8656440	8662120	hyped up for Modern Warfare 2 that year, until that, that news broke, and I just lost interest,
8662120	8666600	and I got bad company too instead. You're talking about all those people that, you know, decide,
8666600	8671080	hey, we're gonna basically form a group that's gonna boycott Modern Warfare 2, and then they
8671080	8676280	were all playing Modern Warfare 2. I just stuck to my guns. I've, if you look at my Steam profile,
8676280	8680680	I don't have that game. I have Call of Duty 4. I mean, the last good one with dedicated servers.
8682920	8689320	It's like, I, I basically have not, I've never played Modern Warfare 2, not even in consoles.
8689320	8692760	SSJ100Matt is in the chat, hold on, because I have to get this out here, because this is kind of
8692760	8697640	funny, is saying, correction, Bobby Kotek is the new devil. Activision would be fine without him
8697640	8703480	there. You agree? Well, yeah, I guess, that's, I guess that's what I was trying to refer to. I mean,
8703480	8708920	he is personifying the evil intentions of the devil. Well, it's him and his company.
8710520	8717640	But yeah, I mean, it's like, after seeing the, the 64, 64 player multiplayer video for Battlefield 3
8717640	8722520	this, this week, I mean, like, like last week when, you know, during Gamescom, it's like,
8722520	8728360	I don't have any incentive to buy Modern Warfare 3 anymore. It's like, sure, they may, they may
8728360	8732760	throw in dedicated servers, but you're, you're gonna get a lot, you're gonna get your money's
8732760	8737960	worth in, in terms of, like, production values and gameplay out of Battlefield 3, just by the looks
8737960	8743000	of it. It's like... Are you going up for a console version or PC version? Both. I mean, I mean...
8743000	8747800	What do you think of the origin stuff? Granted the, the console's like, what, 24 players, and
8747800	8753720	obviously the PC's more, but it's, it's still pretty good from both, from both spectrums.
8753720	8757160	What do you think the, what do you think the origin... Our Modern Warfare 3 is just doing is,
8757160	8763640	is rehashing perks. That's it, that's all it is, is the, it base, the whole basis is, the more kills
8763640	8769960	you get, the more, you know, the more balance you tip against the others. Is it... Like, you know,
8769960	8776600	UAV, you're just spamming UAV air, airstrikes, and so forth. What, what about the fact that on PC
8776600	8782520	you're forced to use origin? I don't know. I mean, I'm kind of, like, indifferent about it.
8782520	8788600	I know I was holding out for them having to, having to sell it on Steam, but at this point,
8788600	8796360	I may give it a shot, because at the end of the day, it's, it's like the same, it's like what,
8796360	8801160	what Valve went through when they first released Half-Life 2. Like, when they first launched Steam,
8801160	8806840	they were basically, they were completely dead set against it. They just hated it, they just hated
8806840	8812440	its guts from the get-go, and now it's pretty much one of the top digital distributors, the top
8812440	8816920	digital distributors. Yeah, it's the thing to have on PC right now. It's kind of the cool kids club.
8817640	8822200	I understand, but as I said, it's like, origin, EA's gonna go through their own,
8822920	8829320	their own Steam moment when, you know, when launching. So it's like, if EA can basically,
8829320	8835800	you know, pass that test in terms of providing a decent alternative to Steam, then, then more power
8835800	8841400	to them. If it, you know, as long as they bring it on par with it, then, then that, you know,
8841400	8846360	it'll be, it'll be an easier pill to swallow. It won't be like eating a shit sandwich.
8847000	8850840	All right. I gotta let you go so we can get more calls, but I gotta say this. I want to know when
8850840	8854120	the next barbecue is happening, because I may need to come back out to New York for that, and I'm
8854120	8861320	going to draw next summer next summer. Yes. Adam is only going to hold the only holds them like
8861320	8868680	once a year, maybe labor day, but I demand one in my honor. Rama will throw one in my honor if I
8868680	8874440	come visit. Yeah, I'm pretty sure he will. All right. Awesome. I get what I want. All right.
8874440	8880040	Take care of Zaku. Thanks for the call. Have a good one. I love the New York contingent. We have
8880040	8883320	a lot of fans in New York. I don't know how it happened. Well, I guess there's a lot of people
8883320	8888040	in New York, so it makes sense, but still we have quite a few listeners there. So I would,
8888040	8894360	I need to go back and say hello. It's been far too long. I need to go. New York is so much fun.
8894360	8900120	Oh my God. Well, you need to go see mistress Tia because I love that bitch. If people will send me
8900120	8907800	a ticket, I'll go. I'm not even playing. That's not how it works. Yeah. Jamie's broke. All right.
8907800	8913800	Uh, hold out for another one of those jet blue sales, man. They go cheap sometimes. Well,
8913800	8918120	we got enough listeners out there that they could send us tickets. You know, I don't see why they
8918120	8922920	don't. Yeah, but then you owe them something. Well, of course we do do this show. I don't know.
8922920	8926680	I don't know. I just, I feel weird asking for money from listeners. You know how I am.
8926680	8931720	All right. Uh, let's see. I got a couple of tweets from a tiger claw. I think I already,
8931720	8936520	we already touched on the one from GameStop doing the streaming things, but how about this one? I
8936520	8941240	like this, uh, about the video game history museum. I didn't even know they were trying
8941240	8946680	to do this. Is this the whole, like the home of video games and whatever it is something,
8946680	8954440	something Iowa or whatever, Iowa. I don't know. Uh, let's see. Uh, it's a lengthy article from
8954440	8958360	Gama Sutra and I didn't read this in advance, so gosh, I don't even know where to start here. We
8958360	8962520	are still seeing calls by the way, orange launch radio on Skype. Uh, Oh, it's ringing right now.
8962520	8966680	Good. That'll give me time to skim this article. Hi. You're on orange launch radio. Who's this?
8966680	8970520	It's a Brad from pod culture. Hey, Brad from pod culture. What's on your mind, buddy?
8970520	8976520	Oh, not a whole lot. Uh, finally joined the contingent and picked up a 3d last week.
8978280	8983400	Was this after the price drop? I'm assuming. Yeah. Ah. And how was it? Um, you know,
8983400	8989400	it's actually a pretty neat little system. I'm actually digging it. Not much in the way of games
8989400	8994280	out yet though. No, there's not. Is there something you're looking forward to that's coming out?
8995080	8998600	Uh, no, no. I'm pretty satisfied with the two that I've gotten right now.
8999720	9007640	DOA dimensions and, uh, bridge rates are 3d. Nice. A lot, a lot of, uh, 3d boobies and DOA,
9007640	9015240	uh, I'm sure I've always liked the DOA franchise. Hmm. A lot of guys do. Uh, let me ask you this.
9015240	9023480	What, what kind of made you decide to take the plunge? The fact that the, uh, evil G had the,
9023480	9028760	if you're one of the power rewards members or whatever the hell membership thing that they got,
9028760	9035000	uh, if you trade in a DS light, you pick it up and 99 bucks. Oh, okay. So you did the whole,
9035000	9040760	like the evil G. I like that by the way, the evil G, uh, uh, I had a true story. This is not going
9040760	9043720	to make sense to anyone, but I just have to say this because you know, some teachers that you
9043720	9049320	have in your past stay with you forever. And I had an awesome, awesome music teacher, uh, in,
9049320	9053400	uh, junior high school and his name was Mr. Gonzalez, but everybody called him Mr. G. Like
9053400	9057480	that was the name he went by for short. And, uh, he, he's a great, oh man, I wish I knew what he
9057480	9060920	was up to these days. I wonder if he's still teaching, but anyhow, when you say evil G,
9061560	9065800	like for whatever reason that just triggers a response in my mind where I see his evil twin.
9068120	9073000	You know what I mean? So, but I like that as a name for GameStop evil G. All right. So,
9073000	9077560	so you, you, you bought into the evil G's, uh, trade in scheme, which is, I can't fault you
9077560	9081320	for a good deal. So it's, it's fine. And that's, that's what made you finally take the plunge.
9082200	9085720	Oh yeah, definitely. Um, I had thought about picking one up when they came out, but
9086520	9092840	250 bucks. That was a, that's a little much when you can pick up one for about a hundred bucks.
9092840	9097640	Oh yeah. And concerned. In fact, that's what I paid for my DS light. Yeah.
9097640	9101880	So what did you think about, we had a call a little bit ago that was talking about,
9101880	9107560	I don't really use my portable game systems portably. Do you find that your gaming habits
9107560	9112040	are similar or do you think that you might actually get more use out of this on the go?
9112600	9116600	Um, I'm interested to take it, taking it to DragonCon and see what I can do with the street
9116600	9123480	pass function. You'll get a ton there. I'm sure I can't even imagine my ass is sitting on the couch.
9125800	9131000	I see. So you're couch surfing and playing the 3DS. That's fine. That's a lot of,
9131000	9135240	a lot of folks. No, Bobby, I didn't steal your name for GameStop.
9136760	9142040	Bobby, Bobby's throwing a tantrum in chat right now, Brad, you need to go address this.
9145560	9148840	He's just mad because his tiny citizens are revolting because, are
9148840	9151640	revolting. Yeah. Because they don't want his tower to get bigger than mine, but anyway,
9151640	9158920	they stink on ice. Uh, so Brad, there's some new games coming out for the 3DS this holiday.
9158920	9164520	Uh, there's the, um, new Mario game, the new Mario Kart game. Any of this stuff look interesting?
9164520	9168120	Oh, well, I like the, I like Mario Kart, so that's definitely worth a look.
9169320	9175720	May pick that up. Absolutely. I think it is going to be worth picking up. So, well, I hope you have
9175720	9180120	a lot of fun at DragonCon and I hope you are able to street pass with tons and tons of people.
9180120	9184840	Uh, and I hope you win lots of awards that I hear you're nominated for that apparently
9184840	9190360	Bobby was not, hence some of the tantrum that's going on in there, but that's okay.
9190360	9194840	We weren't nominated either. Uh, you were nominated. Were we?
9195560	9202280	You didn't make, make it as a finalist, I don't think. Oh, well. Pretty sure you were nominated.
9202280	9205320	I don't know. I didn't see any emails on it this year, but oh, well, it's all good.
9206200	9212440	I ain't mad. So, well, you know, but, uh, yeah, it's, uh, you know, if you can get in on the deal
9212440	9216280	for the 3DS, I'd tell people, you know, go ahead and check it out. It's a, it's a lot of fun.
9217080	9221320	All right. Sounds good. Another raging raving endorsement for the 3DS. All right. Well,
9221320	9224360	Brad, buddy, we're gonna let you go. So we wrap things up, but thanks so much for the call.
9224360	9229880	All right. Later guys. Later. All right. So I had a little more time to read the article there in
9229880	9233160	between, um, some of the conversation there. And by the way, that's going to do it for the
9233160	9236760	Skypline tonight. Thanks to those that called to those that didn't get through. Sorry. Maybe next
9236760	9241160	time. Uh, anyhow, or you can send us emails, of course, mailbag at orange launch radio.com.
9241160	9247240	Remember, we need, uh, 10 emails for the Mexican Fiesta drinking party, uh, to happen here on the
9247240	9254040	show. And we're talking horchata, not tequila. Um, let's see. Apparently these guys want to set up
9254040	9257720	some type of like collectible museum. It's the guys that are behind the Classic Gaming Expo.
9257720	9263960	This is all a tweet to a story on a gamasutra that Tiger Claw sent us via Twitter. Uh, apparently
9263960	9268360	there are these guys, they're the folks behind Classic Gaming Expo. They've got a collection
9268360	9273560	of 30,000 items that they want to put into a permanent official home where folks can like
9273560	9279000	research document and so forth, but they need $30,000 to set up the base in Silicon Valley.
9279000	9283160	And they got less than two weeks to go to do it and they don't even have half of the money that
9283160	9288280	they need to do it. So it's not looking too good. And I guess a lot of the backers just don't have
9288280	9292360	an idea where the money is going and you know, I guess what they're going to get out of it,
9292360	9298200	so to speak. Um, so some of the collection shows off at trade shows and all that stuff.
9298200	9304360	So they want to do it, but it sounds like they may not hit it. That's too bad. It would be nice
9304360	9310280	to have a video game museum of sorts and Silicon Valley definitely is a much more logical place
9310280	9318680	to put it than whatever the fuck Iowa. Uh, but, um, yeah, I can see where they're having problems
9318680	9323480	selling an idea like that. Like what they might want to do is maybe try to have it as like an
9323480	9329160	expansion to some type of a museum that already exists that speaks to nerds interests. Like one
9329160	9334520	really cool place I went to last year was the sci-fi museum in Seattle, which is attached to
9334520	9338840	the experience music project, which is a neat little museum. Like maybe there's a place in that
9338840	9343640	whole thing that they could fit a video game tribute into, you know, that, that might be the
9343640	9351080	way to do it. I know San Jose has a technology museum. That's pretty awesome. Maybe that's the
9351080	9357560	way to do it. All right. Uh, there you go. That's going to do it for another show. But first I need
9357560	9363560	to make sure last minute stories. Yes. No, maybe so. I'm just dropping grenades on ants. Oh, so
9363560	9367160	you're too busy fighting insects to do last minute stories. That's fine. It's cool. Well, we have
9367160	9372680	some last minute stories that can talk about them if you want. Yes, please. Let's. Um, well, let's
9372680	9377160	see. There's a couple of music games coming out this fall and we can talk a little bit about what
9377160	9383720	tracks will be featured in said games. Um, starting with, of course, dance central to the announced
9383720	9390200	initial song list, including some of the songs. Um, was it sexy chick by David Guetta and a con,
9390200	9396600	uh, daddy Yankee featuring Fergie with impacto, the rude with sandstorm. That's pretty funny. Oh,
9396600	9404600	goodie. Uh, death punk with techno logic. Um, Bruno, Bruno Mars with grenade, uh, ozone with,
9404600	9412600	uh, was it, uh, drag us? Dragostea, uh, dente. That's the new manuma song. Yes. You know,
9413400	9414760	remember the guy sitting in his chair?
9422520	9428360	Donna summers with hot stuff. Uh, Gnarls Barkley with run, uh, Lena with satellite,
9428360	9436760	uh, and Ricky and glee is, uh, with, I like it, uh, lady Gaga with born this way. Yes.
9437800	9445240	Exile with I wish for you and, uh, Florida with, uh, David Guetta club can't handle me.
9446440	9451320	It's a pretty good mix of songs. I like that. Uh, and it's supposed to, you do all the dance
9451320	9456280	central one stuff like import, like the rock band series, right? That's awesome. And then of course,
9456280	9461560	just dance three will be coming out, um, actually almost around the same time. We're talking like
9461560	9468920	a week apart. Um, so they have, I don't know, I don't think it's a full list, but damn 46 tracks
9468920	9473320	so far. I'm not going to go through all of them, but, uh, some of the classic stuff too unlimited
9473320	9481000	with no limit. Uh, aha would take on me. Um, banana Ramo with visa or Venus. Uh, but I have
9481000	9484920	some new stuff in there though. I see LMFAO and the party rock Anthem. That's like a big song
9484920	9491400	right now. That is pretty cool. Um, the cover of boogie wonderland looks like, uh, Katy Perry with
9491400	9499880	California girls. Alan will be so happy to hear that he loves Katy Perry. Uh, I like Mika. I see
9499880	9503880	Mika's in there. That's good. So it's a pretty round set list that is that they're saying that
9503880	9507880	may not be the whole thing. I don't know if that's the whole thing. Hmm. Is that for the,
9507880	9515240	we and the PS3 and three. So it is going to be on all of them this time. Yes. Nice. So, um,
9515960	9521960	yeah, that's, uh, interesting. And they even have crazy little thing called love by queen.
9523720	9528280	Queen songs are good or scissor sisters. I don't feel like dancing. That's a fun song.
9528280	9530440	I always, that song for some reason makes me think of the Muppets.
9532440	9534920	It must be that one performance they did at the Brit awards. I don't know.
9534920	9539160	All right. So that'd be a good, good one. I guess. I guess the music's very important
9539160	9544440	to a dancing. I've never played just dance, but people seem to really like it. It's very similar,
9544440	9550360	kind of a little bit like dance masters, but less, it gives you a little bit of an idea of what
9550360	9555640	you're supposed to do. Like they have kind of, it's still kind of following on screen, but there's
9555640	9562280	not that many cues to it. Okay. But it's, it's a lot more than dance masters where dance masters
9562280	9566360	doesn't give you any cues whatsoever. Well, it's going to be fun to watch these two games have a
9566360	9571800	showdown. Yeah. No dance masters this year. Too bad. What a shock. I know.
9573960	9579800	Um, connectimals is coming to a windows 7 phone this fall. That's kind of weird.
9581240	9585880	SSX looks awesome. They were showing off some of the events that they can feature, including
9585880	9593720	a hundred thousand, um, player events. Uh, so that's gonna be really cool. And, um, yeah,
9593720	9599720	that's it. All right. Well, that's gonna start to close the book on another week here at orange
9599720	9603960	lounge radio, but we can't call it a show until we go around and get everybody's final thought.
9603960	9607640	So dark soccer, your final thought for us tonight. I have good friends.
9609560	9611560	My final thought is Jamie has good friends.
9611560	9617320	Loki. Your final thought tonight is I got to cut back on expenses a lot.
9619000	9622600	Uh, thank you guys so much for downloading orange launch radio and tuning into us. Uh,
9622600	9626760	thank you for supporting independent podcasting. If you like what you hear, remember we don't ask
9626760	9631000	for your money to do this program. We do it for free just cause you know, it's a way to kill a
9631000	9635560	Sunday night. Just tell a friend about the show. Help us spread the word about orange lounge radio.
9635560	9640360	That's all we ask. Uh, leave us a nice five star review on iTunes or whatever website it is that
9640360	9645240	you found this podcast on. You would not believe how much a little word spreading can go. We really
9645240	9649880	appreciate it. Um, so that's going to do it. We're not here next week. Sorry guys. The show's
9649880	9654120	going to last you for two weeks. If you are tuning in live next week though, there's a new
9654120	9659000	OLR best of, um, I actually don't have anything to do with those. The dark Tetsuya has been
9659000	9663080	spearheading those. So, uh, that's all going to, I don't even know what's going to be in it. So
9663080	9669160	I will tell you though that a lot of the stuff he, at least the first one was all really old stuff.
9669160	9673320	So for those folks that are like, what did OLR sound like nine years ago? If you really want to
9673320	9676520	subject yourself to it, cause it was a much different show then, uh, best stuff is a good
9676520	9680920	way to do it. It will not be on the podcast feed. It will only be live. You must, must tune in live
9680920	9684680	to hear it. Uh, might be up for download on the website later if we're in a good mood, but it
9684680	9689560	won't be on the podcast feed. Sorry. It's just, it's a special thing. Sorry. Sorry kids. So, um,
9690200	9693880	that's it though. That's going to do it. Have a great week, two weeks, everybody,
9693880	9699080	and, uh, we'll see you back here. Labor day weekend with more of orange launch radio. Good night.
9723880	9729080	Or all games.com, but we're probably right. Anyway, see you next week.
