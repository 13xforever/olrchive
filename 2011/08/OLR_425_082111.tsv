10307	12489	Sky, and Loki.
14170	25498	Tonight, August 21st, 2011, the PlayStation 3 price is cut, the Vita promises to deliver many popular social apps, and are Japanese retailers losing interest in the Xbox 360?
31752	37055	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
37295	38896	Orange Lounge Radio.
38976	42458	We are live on this Sunday, August the 21st of 2011.
43458	53203	My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games, gamer lifestyle, gaming culture, and all that fun stuff with my co-host, the one, the only, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
53463	53984	Philodo.
54524	54724	What?
54944	55444	Philodo.
55505	56065	Speak English.
56625	56925	I am.
57146	58266	Well, it's kind of, it's Greek.
58567	60468	I'm having spinach pie.
61009	61769	Spinach pie.
62390	63751	Like spanakopita, only big.
64732	65652	Okay, it sounds good.
66073	66473	It's Greek.
67254	67714	There's plenty.
69115	71097	And I just know feta cheese.
71117	71797	That's Greek, too.
71897	73459	And the olives, they're really good.
73499	73739	All right.
74119	77842	Also say hello to, I'm ignorant, say hello to Tech Master Loki.
77922	78903	What she meant to say is, Philodo!
78923	79563	Philodo!
81857	84558	Secret ingredient is phyllo dough!
86059	88180	Just doing a speaker check, everybody out there.
88660	93162	Make sure your levels are Loki appropriate tonight for him to scream in the microphone.
93462	94142	How you doing, Loki?
94322	94783	I'm doing fine.
95083	95383	Awesome.
95788	108873	All right, always present with us, the chat room, the fourth guest on the program, chat.orangeloungeradio.com if you want to join us on this Sunday night with us as we are taping episode number 425 of our show live.
109513	112054	So I don't know about you guys, I've had a pretty busy day.
112194	117736	I was on another podcast this morning for a good, God, it probably went for about two, two and a half hours, but it was a good show.
117756	118076	Isn't it fun?
118436	118996	It was fun.
119016	124080	I was hanging with my sassy British friends on the Girls Gone Wow podcast, which I know is funny because I'm not a girl.
124500	125681	But it doesn't matter.
126022	126922	It's still a good time.
127242	130405	And the girls that are on the show are very fun.
130505	132826	They took my suggestion and called you Sky and called him Rob?
133027	133687	Yes, they did.
133727	134047	They did.
134468	135608	I didn't know that was your suggestion.
135809	136209	Good for you.
136689	138050	So anyway, yeah, I was doing that this morning.
138090	139291	So a cheap plug for them.
139431	139831	That works.
140292	146276	And yeah, before we get into Gaming Weeks, I want to talk about this because this is something I was kind of doing this weekend as well.
146516	146636	And...
147698	153758	So, I haven't mentioned this on Twitter and I haven't really talked about this anywhere because I wanted to just kind of start off tonight's show talking about this, but...
154708	156309	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
181127	183049	I'm going to be totally just blunt and honest.
183750	185832	I read that article on Joystick.com.
186252	189776	I don't know how many of you guys saw this, but Joystick ran an article a couple days ago.
189816	190136	You know them.
190156	191918	They're a very big gaming blog.
191938	192699	They have their own show.
192759	193620	It's huge on iTunes.
193660	194801	I'm sure many of you subscribe.
195382	201409	As far as the more corporate blogs go, I guess you could say they're definitely one of the better ones.
202109	216377	and it's because of interesting things like this that they do that make them stand out and they ran an article Thursday or Friday about Xenoblade coming out in Europe and the article was basically how to play Xenoblade on a US Wii
217177	239726	and it basically was here is what you need to download here is how you hack your console and here's where you buy your import copy of Xenoblade so you can play it on the Wii and I have to admit a lot of what was holding me back before to hacking my console was it seemed kind of complicated like I know Loki was always doing all that stuff but you know Loki and we've talked about this on the show before Loki breaks shit because he can't that's
240146	243209	And sometimes I break shit when I don't want to break shit, but it happens.
243390	244711	That's just part of the process.
255362	276054	so I mean it looks lengthy but it looks easy so I followed it step by step and I did it it was it was pretty easy and I gotta admit it was kind of neat seeing like all the you know because when you're doing some of this stuff you basically are booting your Wii like it's a PC and so it has kind of like that old school IBM PC font and you see all these programs that are running in that and so forth and
277035	278115	It's Linux loaders.
279076	280517	I don't even know what the hell's going on.
280557	282579	I just kind of followed all the instructions and there you go.
282919	285561	So now if I want to import Xenoblade, I can.
286802	289164	I don't know how I feel about that right now.
289484	292346	I really, really do not like Xenoblade.
292466	293446	This whole region.
293666	295007	I don't like region locking.
295387	298828	I don't like the fact that some games come out in one region and don't come out in the other.
299388	301248	I love so much more what Sony's doing.
301728	306829	And maybe I think that was part of my big motivator was that I just wanted to make my Wii region free.
307310	315031	And now I can check out some of this other cool shit about like what custom Mario Kart Wii and so forth.
315271	315992	And what?
316092	317292	You can play President Cat.
318593	320714	Yes, I could play President Cat.
320794	325237	I didn't even think of that, but that's a damn good reason for me to have done what I did to my Wii.
325437	327679	If there's any game worth importing, it's that one.
327739	329400	If I could even find a copy anymore.
330080	330721	I have a copy.
330841	331121	Really?
331301	332242	Yeah.
332463	334004	I would like to borrow President Cat.
334345	335746	I bought a copy of President Cat.
336006	338769	Played it once and it sits in the shelf somewhere.
339070	340571	I knew there was a good reason I did this.
341732	346417	And I realize some folks out there that are very anti-hacking and all that are like, Rob, how could you?
346858	348800	You've been the voice of reason on the show for so long.
348840	349480	How could you do this?
349821	352624	Well, if you want to know how he could do it, the instructions were on Joystick.
354465	369820	at the end of the day yes that's exactly right somebody wrote an article like how to do this for dummies and I was like alright I can do it and I did it and in some ways I realized I was taking a risk with my Wii console that you know I might break it or something like that
370440	373061	You're such a naughty boy.
373121	373681	Well, I didn't...
393426	394106	Thanks for watching!
403854	430400	I think it's interesting that I could use the USB loader to like load up my games onto one drive but I don't know I don't know if I'll really do that because I honestly think it's just easier to just get the damn disc and put it in the Wii if I'm actually gonna play any of those games let's face it many of which I don't anymore once in a blue blue moon I'll decide there's something on the Wii I want to play usually it's a virtual console game to be honest so there you go
431400	439487	Loki, what do you think of, now I gotta ask this question, what do you think of the fact that a big blog like Joystick did this?
439647	443130	Because clearly they did it to make a statement, like at least that's what I read out of it.
443210	450396	They did it to make a statement that Nintendo, by not releasing Xenoblade in the US, you leave us no other choice.
450796	458382	I think they've run an article similar to that before anyways, and I know they've done it before with the PSP, so, nah, I'm not surprised.
460290	489991	hmm what do you think DarkSakura what do you think of a website like that kind of you know a prestigious if we will gaming website they're kind of doing that they're gonna get a cease and desist from Nintendo and then take the article down but the damage has been done their protest has been made do you think that they made a statement or do you think that they look kind of you know and I'm not I'm not asking this to open any channel of disrespecting what they did but let's see look statemently to me you know yeah I think they did and well done
491710	496713	So now here's the other interesting thing about this whole Xenoblade and the last story in this whole saga.
497294	503098	My gut still tells me we've got PAX coming this weekend and there's going to be a lot of news that comes out of PAX.
503658	508481	I think that usually you don't have a lot of big, big announcements coming out of PAX.
508541	510342	Like usually that's what E3 is for.
510863	514045	Gamescom usually ends up being a pretty similar show to PAX.
514645	517267	However, PAX has been getting bigger and bigger.
517727	518968	It's been a sellout show.
519328	521430	I think you do see companies making more and more announcements.
521994	526659	and honestly in my mind, what better time to announce Xenoblade?
527200	532686	I honestly think if Nintendo does not announce Xenoblade at PAX next week, they're not going to.
534231	553753	I think next week is really the last quote-unquote last chance I mean granted they can hold a press conference whenever they want and say whatever they want but as far as a celebration if you will of the fans next week is the chance for them to do that Nintendo is in Seattle they're in the backyard of Seattle it's not a problem for them to do packs and they do go I think every year
553953	554494	Yeah, I think so.
572600	581506	I'm not so sure if Nintendo's doing PAX that they're going to bring the Wii U. And the reason why is that the Wii U did not get a huge reception at E3.
582166	584748	And so they might have taken things back to the drawing board.
584788	586709	They may not be ready to show that to the public.
587270	592493	If Nintendo's going to E3, or excuse me, if Nintendo's going to PAX, they're going to be showing off the 3DS.
592613	593354	That's for sure.
593394	594275	That'll be their huge thing.
594355	599798	Their huge push will be the Mario game, the Mario Kart, and the 3DS price cut.
599858	602460	That is going to be the majority of what they're pushing.
603521	610245	but they do have a handful of titles coming out on the Wii this holiday season like what Rhythm Heaven there's another Kirby game right?
610365	630558	it's on it's way so there's a few things that Nintendo kind of still has going on and what a perfect time for them to say oh yeah and over here on these kiosks we have hey American Xenoblade I really think the push is going to be more of the 3DS obviously because they just dropped the system down in price they've really kicked up the advertising for it I don't know if you've seen the ads about you know
631198	635604	Basically highlighting the three big games from Star Fox, Mario, Mario Kart.
638428	639530	So they're definitely pushing.
641809	649972	So going to the chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com, BlackWolf is in chat saying, Nintendo won't bring the Wii U because they only showed it at E3 to stop leaks.
650052	654654	And see, I'm kind of inclined to agree is that maybe not totally the reason why.
654694	663877	I think part of the reason why, I think if the Wii U had had a huge, oh my gosh, everybody's got to do this, and hold this whole huge reception at E3, I think they would have had a little bit of it at PAX.
664617	691970	but also keep in mind that the PAX booths are a lot smaller than the E3 booths and they don't always have as much space to show everything and if they were to bring the Wii U they would have those huge lines that go with it I just don't think now is the time for them to be pushing the Wii U next year's PAX maybe because we could be looking at the Wii U for next holiday but I just think this year's PAX is going to be all about the 3DS and maybe just maybe Xenoblade
693847	696808	I'm actually entirely inclined to agree with that.
698328	701689	And SSJ100Matt is confirming for me that Nintendo is going to be at PAX.
701709	702189	Thank you very much.
703150	710032	UnfoldedRaptor is in our chatroom saying, Sky, the last story, another big RPG for the Wii, is getting localized for Europe but not for America.
710452	712772	I think we'll see this whole situation again in the future.
712852	713553	Oh, absolutely.
713793	714253	Absolutely.
714893	719176	Well, this is, the last story is still part of that, whatever that campaign, yeah.
719256	723659	But otherwise, the games actually, I mean, they're both RPGs, but that's kind of where the similarities end.
724020	732526	The huge thing about the last story is it's Mistwalker, meaning, like, Nobe Uematsu did the music, the guy that did the Final Fantasy, the original, is behind this.
732606	735228	I mean, Mistwalker games are usually a pretty big deal.
736208	737089	Of course, well, I don't...
737389	737910	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
755532	756232	Gang fight, gang fight
783178	784079	I don't know.
784499	798810	Our little dog and pony podcast does not get quite the amount of viewers that Joystick does, so I'm not sure what kind of happens when you're that big, if you can get away with more things like that without getting blacklisted or what have you.
798850	803934	But I do seem to remember some time ago, Kotaku did something to piss Sony off.
804674	825240	and they're another big blog and they got blacklisted for a little while but it was well when I say a little while it was literally like 48 hours or something something was quickly remedied there so you know a blog that big has a lot of pull I gotta say so I don't think Nintendo could just straight up blacklist them but you know there's there's things Nintendo could do if they want so
825748	827529	They could stomp their little foot and pout.
828430	833174	Black Wolf is being a party pooper saying the last story soundtrack actually was done by Yoshitaka Suzuki.
833214	834435	It was not done by Nobuo Imatsu.
834715	836116	He didn't even do the theme or anything?
836156	838478	That's surprising to me because he's a part of Mistwalker Studios.
838898	840139	So, whatever.
841140	841440	Let's see.
842240	859653	uh we're gonna get into how was your gaming week here in just a minute but let me go to another kind of random question that popped up in chat uh from Danish hey guys Mr. Niche here I have a question for OLR from what information you know at this moment would you guys buy the 3DS now or wait for the PlayStation Vita if you could only buy one
861533	863174	Hmm.
863334	873622	I already own a 3DS, but see, here's where I'm at, is that I kind of think the systems are spaced far enough apart where that if you plan well, you can kind of afford both.
874143	874483	I agree.
875964	882990	But if you're very adamant, like, no, I only have X amount, and I understand there's students and people on fixed budgets that can only afford one or the other.
883790	887554	It's really hard right now for me to say, yeah, go for the Vita.
888134	893760	Because for the Vita right now, we have a lot of announcements and we have a lot of ideas for games.
894180	901827	But now that the Vita is not launching until 2012, there's a part of me that wonders if it's not going to have a very similar situation to what the 3DS had.
901947	906051	Meaning, yeah, it's going to launch in March, but there's not going to be any really good launch games.
906371	908853	And then everything you really want will be out at the holidays.
909654	923827	so part of me says if you think you could have enough money this holiday and then again next holiday I think you're safe to get a 3DS right now and then get a Vita later otherwise it really depends on what games you want to play because if you want to play Uncharted
924868	953472	3DS doesn't have anything like that right now so clearly you need to get a Vita but if you want to play Mario the Vita doesn't have anything like that right now so you need to get a 3DS so I don't have an easy answer it really depends on what games do you want to play because that's the only thing that's setting the two systems apart right now if you think about it this way the two systems don't have any games in common it's not like the Xbox and the 360 herp derp the 360 and the Playstation 3 what do they have in common
953971	957457	They might have some franchises that get one game here and one game here.
957838	959962	But what games do the two both have?
960523	962466	Lego Harry Potter, yours 5 through 7.
962707	964470	Well, excuse me!
965646	966546	Hey, you said none.
967947	970788	I just pissed off a bunch of Harry Potter Lego fans.
970888	972429	My bad on that.
972969	985734	I will actually say that if it were me, I'm going to get 3DS because I haven't touched our PSP since I was playing Popola Cross.
987015	988495	No, I was playing Roku Loko.
988735	990616	I was playing something back then, but it was about a year.
991136	992197	Here's something else to consider.
994245	996506	Do you need that portable device to do other shit for you?
996666	998647	Meaning, do you need an MP3 player as well?
999067	1000768	Do you want something to surf the web with?
1000869	1003630	I mean, granted, the 3DS does have a web browser, but it's kind of shit.
1003650	1004711	Terrible!
1006592	1015357	Where the PSP really succeeded that the original DS or DS Lite, whatever you want to call it, kind of didn't do so well is it, you know, what's PlayStation's little tagline?
1015437	1016418	It only does everything.
1016678	1021260	Well, that's kind of true when it comes to PSP versus DS, you know, going back.
1021400	1028542	And what I imagine will continue to be the case in Vita versus 3DS is that the PS Vita is going to be able to do this other stuff.
1028562	1034864	We have a story later on tonight about apps that you know from the iPhone are going to be making their way to the Vita.
1035264	1040006	If you don't have an iPhone, so maybe you have a need for this kind of stuff, then the Vita looks more appealing.
1040926	1046068	But if you don't need any of that crap, you don't need Facebook again because maybe you have an Android or something.
1046548	1070952	and maybe you're fine with the 3DS so I know you want me to say one or the other but every gamer is different and it's really about at the end of the day what's the golden rule of gaming a system is only as good as the games that are on it and only you know what games you want to play so speaking of games you want to play let's talk about our gaming weeks and we usually like to start off the show talking about what video games we have been playing so DarkSakura start us off
1071918	1074019	Games I have been and am playing right now.
1075020	1075300	Sims 3.
1076701	1079782	I've got everything up except for the newest expansion.
1080602	1082183	And I am playing the crap out of it.
1083043	1086525	And then I have been playing World of Warcraft.
1086585	1088586	And I actually got really burned out last night.
1089386	1091647	Like, I could not... I played for like five hours.
1092268	1097230	Because I was just sitting here going... I'm going to play my Paladin.
1097330	1099051	It takes so long to level when you're in the 70s now.
1100571	1106053	I mean, it's faster than it was with my mage, because hi, everything there is undead, and hi, paladin, holy, whatever.
1106553	1107453	So I've been playing a bunch of that.
1108794	1114556	And I've actually played Robot Unicorn Attack for a little bit today, and Tiny Tower.
1115396	1115696	That's it.
1117353	1117693	All right.
1117893	1118733	Loki, what have you been up to?
1118773	1120514	You're playing something right now during the show.
1120554	1121954	What is this that you're checking out right now?
1122554	1124274	I'm playing Earth Defense Force Insect Norm again.
1124755	1128675	The minute you paused it and it said, destroy the anthill, I'm like, oh, this must be Earth Defense Force.
1128875	1129035	Yes.
1129636	1132316	Actually, I've been playing a lot of Earth Defense Force this week.
1132776	1133576	My boss is out of town.
1133636	1137477	Normally, he wants to play Grand Theft Auto during our breaks and lunch and stuff.
1138957	1144879	But since he's gone and our other co-worker's gone, we've only had three people, and so we've been playing Earth Defense Force...
1146599	1166511	All week long and it's been awesome I've leveled up my tactical guy Up to tier 7 Trying to level up to tier 8 now By farming this first level And there's a trick to it And it also involves the rubber band Kind of a cheat I guess So I will be doing that During the show You don't cheat at anything ever
1167652	1168593	It's an exploit.
1168853	1170234	It's not necessarily a cheat.
1170434	1175417	I am not hacking or anything, even though I could have done that, but I did not.
1175657	1177898	So I am leveling up legitimately.
1177918	1181700	I just don't feel like holding the trigger down for three hours.
1183261	1185162	So that's where the rubber band comes into play.
1185902	1186183	So, yeah.
1187543	1190504	You do all the cheating you want in single player mode.
1190584	1191205	You know what?
1191485	1194746	If you want to cheat the hell out of it when you're by yourself, then go for it.
1194766	1195686	It's all co-op.
1195706	1196607	There's no cheating.
1196927	1198167	There's no leaderboards.
1198247	1198827	There's nothing.
1199628	1200768	It's only for my own benefit.
1202809	1211552	The other stuff I've been playing, I played VVVV and I finished the game, but I still have to get some of the shiny objects in there.
1211912	1226971	and that game was really hard and frustratingly hard sometimes but I think that's the point of it and it was fun let's see what else did I play a little bit of Grand Theft Auto and
1230089	1231170	I think that's it, actually.
1231310	1232111	Just those three.
1233132	1236996	I don't think I played... I may have turned Tiny Tower on once.
1238277	1245684	Actually, I probably should download the update for that, so I'll probably do that and then maybe build some more empty floors since I can't build anything else.
1247185	1247285	Um...
1249287	1249868	Yeah, that's it.
1250928	1253210	My gaming week, my Xbox is still out of commission.
1253270	1257333	If you haven't heard the story yet, listen to last week's show at the very beginning.
1258013	1259554	So I don't really have any updates on that yet.
1259594	1267960	It's just sitting there collecting dust until that whole debacle's settled down because even though I can play things in single player mode, I don't want to get achievements and stuff.
1268080	1269221	So I don't know.
1269261	1273884	I've just moved on to PlayStation 3, which is what I've been playing mostly in my console gaming time.
1274784	1277385	Not a lot of new stuff for me to talk about on PlayStation 3.
1277425	1279305	I've been revisiting some of the old stuff.
1279725	1290267	Played Katamari randomly during the week and also was playing a game that I think I briefly talked about before, like last year on the show when it first came out, but it's Hardcore Uprising.
1290768	1294628	And if you don't know what this game is, it's basically Contra, but they didn't call it Contra.
1295008	1301790	It's Hardcore Uprising and what the art is all by Arc System Works and all this, although it's still a Konami game and
1302390	1305011	Yeah, it's something that Extifer, of all people, got me into.
1305031	1306652	If you guys listen to Horde House, you know Extifer.
1306912	1308813	And he is really into this game right now.
1309333	1315876	And when we all went over to his house about a week ago, he was playing it, and I was kind of watching him, and I was like, oh, this actually looks kind of fun.
1315936	1319598	Like, I don't remember feeling this awesome about the game after playing the demo.
1320230	1320771	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1338830	1350495	and in the uprising mode you basically all your points turn out to be a currency and you use these points to upgrade your characters so that the mode can get a little easier and a little easier.
1350595	1360059	Like maybe you can make your life bar a little bit longer or you get yourself a few more lives or your power up will be a little bit stronger next time that you get that power up.
1360519	1375127	so I like being able to progress that way because that way it doesn't feel like you keep banging your head against the wall because you keep dying at the same point you know you know that as long as you keep racking up points you'll be able to get your character more and more powered so you'll be able to get through all that stuff so um
1376127	1378268	Yeah, that's the cool thing about Hardcore Uprising.
1379609	1386111	And yeah, if you want the hardcore stuff, though, there's Arcade Mode, where you don't have any of the power-ups, and you just gotta push through.
1386411	1390913	And I was excited that I could beat the first stage without continuing, okay?
1391373	1393714	Like, that was... In the Contra game, that's huge.
1393754	1394655	Yeah, it is huge.
1394695	1395215	I'm sorry.
1395315	1395935	So there you go.
1396956	1400057	And yeah, Zether's in the chatroom going, Get all the achievements.
1400177	1402018	Try beating it on no-death mode.
1403476	1404257	Good luck with that!
1418750	1426816	Zether is also clarifying that it's more of a sequel to the game on the Genesis is where that comes from.
1426836	1427237	Contra Hardcore.
1427577	1428898	Yeah, Contra Hardcore.
1429598	1430719	Alright, I mean, whatever.
1430759	1431880	At the end of the day, it's Contra.
1432100	1432721	That's what I feel.
1432741	1435042	You have a spread gun, you have all the medals.
1435523	1438885	Contra Hardcore was pretty dang hard.
1439205	1439386	Yeah.
1441147	1441747	So there you go.
1441847	1444750	That was Hardcore Uprising.
1444770	1451855	And that was pretty much, other than that, some more PC games, more Civilization V because it's great, and of course World of Warcraft.
1452015	1453136	So that was my gaming week.
1453856	1457299	All right, quickly some housekeeping before we get into the news tonight.
1457719	1460081	I want to quickly say there is no show next Sunday.
1460661	1466104	I do believe another best of is being prepped for the live folks that listen at allgames.com.
1466164	1467144	So at least there will be that.
1467465	1469105	But we will not be live next week.
1469586	1473047	I'm going to be out of town and we're just going to take the week off.
1473067	1474188	I'm helping somebody move.
1474328	1475909	It's been a while since we had a week off.
1475969	1476489	So darn it.
1476569	1477510	Sometimes we take a day off.
1477570	1479070	So we're taking next week off.
1479090	1480211	We'll be back in two weeks.
1480491	1483653	It is a little bit of a bummer that we're missing next week because it is PAX.
1484213	1499424	but just the timing of everything not really going to work out so my hope is that maybe some of our listeners are going to PAX and they're just not going to be able to tune in because they're flying back or whatever so we'll do a big roundup and everything when we come back on Labor Day weekend we will be having a show so we'll be seeing you guys then.
1500064	1503506	Otherwise, in the meantime, follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.
1503807	1507089	We're also on Facebook at facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
1507689	1511431	And, of course, there's always our website, www.orangeloungeradio.com.
1511451	1512272	There's some forums.
1513012	1517215	I noticed that we had a post where some of the things that we weren't sure.
1517255	1523839	Remember how last week we had the email that linked to a DeviantArt account and we weren't sure if we could post the pictures of the Capcom building and all the stuff that we were linked?
1524179	1527301	Well, that emailer went and made a post in our forums and was like, oh, I don't care.
1527341	1527842	Here it all is.
1528182	1532145	So if you want to kind of like see that second half to last week's email, it's all there on the forums.
1532565	1534707	So check that out at orange launch radio dot com.
1535247	1535427	All right.
1535447	1536628	Let's get into tonight's news.
1536788	1537729	Loki, start us off.
1537969	1538189	Yes.
1539230	1540291	So start things off.
1540311	1544014	We're going to talk a little bit about PlayStation and.
1546115	1548497	Some interesting stuff came out this week from Gamescom.
1564947	1572510	and I'm sure that's just to kind of pick up the pace for the holiday season because I don't think they've been top dog for the last few months.
1572630	1576431	So they kind of have to, I guess, try a little harder.
1577091	1581633	So also they're going to be rolling out some new bundles as well.
1581653	1582473	Infamous 2.
1582573	1584334	I know there's one for Uncharted 3.
1584554	1585294	I think it'll work?
1612487	1615268	It'll help drive sales, that's for sure.
1615809	1620131	Whether it pushes the whole 3D platform.
1620251	1623672	Do you think 3D gaming is really what people want right now?
1623692	1625673	Does anyone in the room really want that?
1625693	1629615	There's a part of me, which I know is ironic because I own a 3DS, but I'm kind of like...
1631515	1635176	3DS is flashing the pan enough for me, I don't know how I feel about it in my living room
1648741	1654927	I think it'll be better once it's more of a passive technology instead of having these active shutter glasses that cost $100 each.
1655527	1669321	I mean, it needs to be to the point where it's like, okay, here's some polarized glasses, like the crap that you get at the movie theater, where that would be maybe a few bucks a pair of glasses, and then it's alright.
1669361	1670863	Then you can invite your friends over, you have...
1671483	1685477	plenty of glasses that go around for them to do that kind of stuff I'm laughing to myself now because speaking of 3D totally forgot to mention played Ridge Racer 3DS this week because I bought it during the Amazon DS 3DS sale last week oops
1687102	1688163	It's awesome, isn't it?
1688603	1692326	Actually, it's a really good show-off-the-system kind of game.
1692526	1696649	Like, if you want to show off the 3D and show off... Some of it's a little gimmicky.
1697030	1701153	Like the whole, like, oh, there's got to be confetti flying at your face in every race.
1701193	1705716	And it's kind of bootsy because the confetti does not go at, like, 30 frames a second.
1706076	1707437	It looks really bootsy to me.
1708278	1711000	And some of the collision is a little dippy.
1711120	1713202	Like, it just doesn't control... Like, if you...
1713522	1714243	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1732318	1733779	The technology is how far along.
1734280	1736842	But otherwise, the 3D effects are pretty good.
1737443	1738364	And yeah, I liked it.
1738424	1742729	Sorry, I didn't mean to turn your story into a Ridge Racer 3DS review, but I just forgot to mention that.
1742749	1743129	No, that's alright.
1743149	1745932	Another system that Ridge Racer is really awesome on, the PSP.
1746933	1751819	If you're late to the game and really want to get into the last generation...
1752299	1755001	Soon to be last generation of handhelds from Sony.
1755521	1757403	You can do so for 99 euro.
1758504	1761826	It's going to be a new PSP model that's kind of a different look to it.
1762867	1765209	More of like a sleek black.
1766009	1767150	Weren't they all sleek black?
1767230	1767630	Oh wait, no.
1767690	1768671	Well, they were shiny.
1768731	1769532	This is more of like a matte.
1769552	1770452	Alan has a silver one.
1770533	1771813	This is like a matte finish.
1774327	1775528	and it will not have Wi-Fi.
1776648	1778029	It is without Wi-Fi.
1778229	1783011	So if you're thinking of playing multiplayer games, uh-uh, not going to happen.
1784932	1787313	Interesting that they cut out the Wi-Fi.
1787333	1789014	You going to surf the web?
1789274	1789474	Nope.
1790355	1794377	That is a pretty big component of the PSP that they just kind of chopped out.
1794457	1801280	But at the same time, you look at it and go, eh, but it's only 99 euros, which I imagine would mean $99 here.
1801340	1802721	Have they even announced it for America?
1803303	1804244	It's not coming to America.
1805085	1805886	It's only in Europe.
1806487	1807167	Why is that?
1807728	1809750	Is that just because Sony does better in Europe?
1810431	1812353	Is this our punishment for rejecting the Go?
1814415	1814856	It's not.
1815156	1820161	I mean, if you're really looking for a cheap system, and this is the problem with this.
1820602	1825087	Once again, they're releasing something that they think is cheap, but it's not.
1825472	1825933	Thanks for watching!
1841335	1841976	for less.
1842576	1850721	I mean, so why would you go and try to buy something brand new for slightly less and it's really kind of a crippled version of the system?
1851321	1854323	Same thing was like with what the PSP Go was.
1855524	1859626	Why would you buy something, you know, more expensive that comes crippled?
1859886	1860967	It doesn't make any sense.
1861327	1862028	No one wants that.
1862428	1869052	So, I mean, they might as well make it smaller and call it the PSP Micro because that's how it's going to sell.
1870856	1871577	No one's going to want it.
1872678	1875582	Why even bother releasing a new PSP anyways?
1875822	1879186	It's just, I think people are already done with the PSP.
1879447	1881690	It's kind of at the end of its life cycle already.
1882871	1888478	Maybe it's kind of their last hurrah for the holiday because the Vita didn't make it.
1890164	1891264	It doesn't matter.
1891284	1893965	Put out a new 3000 bundle or something like that.
1894005	1899527	They just had one that came out with Madden and Need for Speed in it or something like that in the US.
1900047	1904969	Why do we have to... Why even bother releasing a new system?
1905289	1911851	Why spend the time right now to redesign the system to make it slightly cheaper to put it out anyways?
1912071	1914792	The only thing I can think of is that they're trying to cash in on...
1918707	1921328	on these reduced price games that they have coming out.
1921348	1925990	They have some UMD dual packs that are coming out for $10 from a bunch of third-party companies.
1926150	1928892	And, I mean, it's a good deal if you're looking for really cheap games.
1929332	1933454	And, yes, you can still download stuff off the PlayStation Store.
1934154	1941057	If you have a PC or a PlayStation 3, you can download it straight off there and put it on a memory stick or something like that.
1941437	1946540	But, I mean, seriously, just buy a used system if you're really going to do that.
1947861	1951087	There's no reason to buy this.
1951368	1953171	Seriously, it's just a buy you system.
1954594	1957139	Hell, you could probably even find a new system for that price.
1957920	1959604	If people are sitting on inventory for it.
1964102	1964583	All right.
1964683	1966486	Well, we see how Loki feels about that.
1966967	1967387	I don't know.
1968569	1971394	I do have to admit the idea of a new PSP is a little silly.
1971914	1979005	I think Loki makes a damn good argument that if you can get a used one cheaper than this, then why go for this when you're missing Wi-Fi?
1980186	1995054	Before he kind of pointed that out, I was thinking, all right, well, it's a way for them to get the system out under $100, so it looks really appealing to maybe younger folks that kind of want one, but the parents don't want to spend that much money on a toy.
1995554	1996075	You know what I mean?
1996855	1997576	But, hmm.
1998911	1999151	All right.
1999291	2002614	Well, anyhow, let's talk about the other handheld system, and that would be the 3DS.
2002834	2007397	As you all, I'm sure, are aware, the 3DS recently had a huge price cut going on to it.
2008038	2009699	And that price cut included Japan.
2010219	2013402	And in Japan, the price of the device went from 25,000 yen down to 15,000 yen.
2013442	2013982	That's a huge price.
2014002	2014122	That's...
2017845	2020166	That's almost larger than the one that it had here in the US.
2021506	2022827	So it's very big.
2023927	2025168	And what was the effect of that?
2025288	2027869	Well, a lot more 3DSs sold.
2028069	2039032	And this week it was announced that, let's see, a couple different figures are out there about exactly how many units sold between August 8th and August 14th.
2039412	2041153	But generally it's around 210,000 units sold.
2044014	2050936	Keep in mind that the launch week of the system saw about, what, 350,000 units sold?
2051616	2053617	Or no, 375,000 units sold.
2053677	2058318	So by cutting the price, you got numbers that were almost back to launch week.
2058398	2062339	I mean, the numbers this past week were larger than they were in week two.
2062939	2067060	And it pushed the adoption mark past 1.5 million.
2070461	2076163	So apparently the price cut did exactly what Nintendo needed it to do and it moved more systems, right?
2077223	2077703	Exactly.
2078024	2079544	It was just an overpriced system.
2079764	2087906	And right now, I mean, they could have probably put it out the original price if they had a good lineup of games, but they didn't.
2088006	2089327	So they need to do something.
2089347	2092408	Either put out some good games or drop the price.
2092548	2096769	And right now they need to drop the price if they want to gain momentum going into the fourth quarter.
2096909	2101951	Well, here's the other thing I want to know about, and that is what is the sales going to look like the next week?
2102372	2113777	Because I'm sure you had a lot of people that ran out and bought one, especially in the U.S., because we had those stores that all cut the price early so that folks could get on that, and then they could be the early adopters as well.
2114097	2115678	And I'm sure the sales figures in the U.S.
2115718	2118199	are going to look very similar when those numbers come out very soon.
2118620	2121301	But I'm curious, what's it going to look like in two weeks?
2121821	2124063	What's the long-term sales of this?
2124103	2125244	And then, of course, through the holiday.
2125625	2128127	I really don't think any of this matters until the holiday.
2128467	2130790	The holiday is what's really going to make or break the system.
2130850	2135574	Yeah, honestly, it didn't really, from my perspective, it didn't really do much.
2135634	2139578	I mean, none of my customers were really buying more systems.
2139618	2143742	They were just kind of like, great, now I can get rid of the system that's been sitting on my shelf for four months.
2143762	2145964	Yeah, they probably just wanted to sell the shit they have.
2149293	2151374	I don't know if that's the situation.
2151714	2158218	If a lot of the retailers out there were just sitting on these systems, then you may not see the spike that you see in Japan right now.
2160099	2164941	I mean, I'm sure it'll help, but I don't know if it's going to be that significant.
2165902	2170484	Akuma JP is in our chat room right now at chat.orangeandre.com, and he is a listener of ours from Japan.
2170905	2176228	And he says, kind of in response to this, a lot of mothers complained because they bought it on the first day.
2177688	2178449	I'll tell you something.
2178629	2180310	I'll tell you what you're going to see.
2181571	2184093	I guarantee you'll see this by early next month.
2184934	2189677	You're going to see Nintendo come out because the NPD numbers are going to come out.
2189738	2192339	3DS is the top handheld system of August.
2193000	2195182	Yeah, because the PSP isn't selling very well.
2195242	2196983	The DS isn't selling very well.
2197343	2200706	Of course the 3DS is going to be the top system now that they did a price drop.
2201006	2203068	But that's PR spin for you.
2203128	2204869	So look for that early next month.
2205256	2208020	Well, what's the long-term effect of a statement like that?
2208160	2215429	Again, I don't see soccer moms running out and buying a 3DS because, oh, well, it was the top-selling system in August, according to MPD.
2215829	2218293	Well, they're just hoping that that kind of momentum will carry on.
2218853	2219895	And it very well might.
2220035	2220575	I mean, because...
2222375	2249427	you know the DS and the PSP are kind of being phased out when that Mario game hits all they have to do look this is all Nintendo has to do bundle that fucking Mario game with a 3DS that thing will sell like crazy for Christmas watch Dan's holding off until the flame one comes out because that's what he wants he wants the flare red he likes his 3DS like he likes his homosexuals flaming and yeah
2251932	2252132	Red.
2252873	2253933	Red's Dan's favorite color.
2254454	2255655	And he wants Star Fox.
2256475	2258076	So those are what's selling it for him.
2258256	2262979	I just... Like, if Nintendo wants to sell a shit ton of 3DSs, that's all they have to do.
2263200	2267242	And, like, kids will be wanting that shit all Christmas long.
2267623	2270284	And it'll be a huge thing that ends up under the Christmas tree this year.
2270905	2273106	It might even end up being the must-have toy.
2273647	2278410	Like, if this shit does Netflix and all this other stuff, like, Nintendo could make this the must-have toy.
2278550	2278830	What?
2279170	2279410	What?
2279731	2280851	It's gonna be the must-have toy?
2281132	2281552	I thought...
2282233	2283775	And this is coming from Activision.
2283996	2286420	I thought Skylanders was gonna be the must-have toy.
2287201	2288723	What the fuck is a Skylanders?
2289004	2289845	Exactly!
2290426	2294533	It's a pain in my ass is what it is right now, and we'll get into that later on, but...
2299103	2303387	I'm trying to say this without sounding like a fanboy.
2304208	2306650	You all heard what I said about what I did with my Wii earlier.
2306710	2308272	So look, that shows you where I'm at.
2308712	2310614	I think the 3DS will be the top selling system.
2310634	2311775	I think it will outsell the consoles.
2312416	2313677	Rob's modified his Wii.
2315759	2317120	I needed it to be more versatile.
2319221	2328627	But no, seriously, I think the 3DS will sell more than the living room consoles because I think most people that want to have an Xbox 360 already have one.
2329207	2334450	The only maybe kind of possibly that could screw me on that prediction would be the PlayStation 3.
2335150	2340893	I think the whole price cut for the PlayStation 3, the fact that it plays Blu-rays, the fact that it's going to do 3D,
2342495	2343796	Don't underestimate that shit.
2344316	2346158	Do not underestimate the power of that shit.
2346599	2357449	Do not underestimate the power of Microsoft and if they feel that their sales are dipping because of the PlayStation 3 dropping in price they can still drop the price.
2357730	2362635	Remember you angry cynical sarcastic gamers soccer moms do not think like you.
2365255	2366376	They are not rational.
2366436	2368876	They cannot be.
2369316	2371497	They should be put down immediately when spotted.
2371517	2371977	No, I'm kidding.
2372017	2372317	I'm kidding.
2372837	2378039	They feel no mercy, no remorse, and they will not stop until you are dead.
2378859	2381220	But that's pretty much what it is.
2381400	2393483	I love when I read predictions on gaming sites from gaming fanboys going, well, this is going to be this way because gamers want this, da-da-da-da, without realizing, well, soccer moms spend more money than gamers do, probably, at the end of the day.
2393763	2396387	Why else is the Wii the number one console for so many years?
2396527	2397008	Let's be real.
2397728	2401534	Because soccer moms buy, you know, Black Ops.
2404870	2429069	Well actually they do because they don't read So I think the Vita getting out of Nintendo's way essentially whether that was intentional or not whereas I think I honestly think Sony's just trying to plan a better launch I think Sony was starting to realize they did not want to have a launch go like the 3DS's launch and if they didn't have the games to back it up they shouldn't launch their system I think that's why they've held it back a little bit
2430370	2431691	At least in America and Europe.
2431812	2433573	I don't know why they're still going ahead in Japan.
2433633	2435094	Maybe there's going to be more games out there.
2435134	2435454	I don't know.
2436035	2436775	So, we'll see.
2437656	2442300	But it's totally cleared the way for 3DSs to just fly these holidays.
2442860	2443240	We'll see.
2443981	2444742	Maybe I'll be wrong.
2445022	2445662	It's happened before.
2445943	2447704	Spread your wings and fly, 3DS.
2447844	2449165	Spread your wings and fly.
2450066	2451487	Alright, let's move on to some other stories.
2451507	2451947	DarkSakura.
2451987	2454069	Well, better that it spreads that than something else.
2454885	2457227	Anyway, moving forward.
2458228	2463573	Well, Japanese retailers are not going to be doing much with the Xbox 360 anymore.
2464153	2477344	It just hit 1.5 million units sold, which is basically... That's in six years, by the way, which is basically what the 3DS did in six months, and that was considered selling badly.
2478265	2479946	You know why it's not doing well over there?
2479966	2480787	Because they're racists.
2482814	2489039	The last big Japanese exclusive came out, Idolmaster 2, is actually going to be coming out on PlayStation 3 now.
2489640	2496325	So, I mean, it's the biggest retailer out there, Jio, is cutting back their stock, but said that they're still going to be available online.
2496766	2500288	By the way, totally hacking my Xbox next so I can play Idolmaster.
2500669	2501109	Just saying.
2502951	2505693	Well, I would rather play Hatsune Miku, but...
2506007	2516995	Anyway, at any rate, the quotes going on saying is that it is our understanding that Amazon now handles a substantial portion of Japanese Xbox 360 software sales.
2517035	2519036	So basically, they say, you want it?
2519096	2519756	Get it online.
2520377	2521798	Amazon.co.jp.
2523479	2523759	That's it.
2524219	2526221	We could special order one of those for you.
2529451	2529991	What do you think?
2530291	2532834	Is this really, really bad news for the 360?
2533014	2536217	It's not surprising.
2536577	2543243	The system, the games, aren't really geared towards Japanese players, I think.
2545425	2548327	My thought is that it's sort of like the reverse Dreamcast.
2549668	2550469	Or the Saturn.
2550930	2552271	There's a good example, the Saturn.
2554189	2557311	Sega Saturn in Japan, fantastic.
2558032	2563035	It was top seller, it really was well supported, great games.
2564116	2566798	Over in the US, not so good, not so good.
2568159	2577325	How many people do you know who still have an old Nintendo, not Nintendo, a Playstation sitting in their closet collecting dust but never ever played a Saturn?
2578145	2578706	That's over here.
2579546	2606242	and then you sort of got the converse going on now with the Xbox 360 and with the Xbox that it just didn't catch on over there maybe it was marketing maybe it was that it wasn't a long time trusted brand over there perhaps whatever reason that it is but I think that it's the same situation it's not marketed the right way it's not pushing towards that audience
2606702	2606822	Yeah.
2606842	2606942	So...
2631334	2632375	Well, I don't know.
2632435	2636137	I mean, I don't think it necessarily spells the end of the 360, certainly.
2636157	2637258	They're going to keep pushing forward.
2637278	2640100	They've done very well in the U.S., that's for sure.
2640200	2643943	Well, that's the point, is that its performance here has been good enough.
2644303	2649447	Because, I mean, I'm sure the Dreamcast release in Japan was not based on American sales of the Saturn.
2649967	2650648	I can tell you that.
2651868	2658253	But it could possibly be that maybe the next Microsoft system to come out won't come out in Japan.
2659884	2675812	that could be very interesting if that happens I honestly can't see that happening I think Microsoft has to try again you know what I see if it does happen that way we get a system over here that's not region locked or it's only available
2677986	2681387	God, I wish a non-region lock system would happen.
2681407	2685468	Most of the games that come out on the 360 are not region locked.
2686209	2687109	Just saying.
2687289	2704114	A lot of the Japanese games that come out are, for some reason, from the Japanese companies, but for the most part, a lot of your big first party games like EA, or third party games like from EA, Ubisoft, that kind of stuff, they are not region locked.
2705194	2728994	you just have to look online either on release sites or on like PlayAsia has a good list of stuff that's not region locked and you can literally import that stuff back and forth there are a few Japanese games that do come out over there region free and you can bring them over here there are some of the cave shmups that were region free but it's rare, it's definitely more rare but you know
2729554	2732678	I seriously think that if they were going to be smart about it and try to
2748092	2767186	I guess avoid the same situation than when they bring out a US game they have a Japanese subtitle on it already or a Japanese menu that's just available through options I don't know how many Japanese games I have that have menus fully in English so it's not a big deal
2767406	2772871	And even if the next system is region locked, most likely it's going to be on Blu-ray or some sort of proprietary format.
2772991	2774252	I'm going to guess probably Blu-ray.
2775714	2779257	And if that's the case, we're the same region as Japan anyways, Blu-ray wise.
2780038	2781599	Video, I mean... No, we're not.
2782079	2782600	Yes, we are.
2782860	2783421	No, we are not.
2783521	2785403	It's region A. They're both the same.
2785703	2787324	Oh, well, for Blu-ray, I'm sorry, I was thinking DVD.
2787905	2788866	We're not the same for DVD.
2789546	2790667	Well, yes, not for DVD.
2790848	2792349	For Blu-ray, we are the same region.
2793163	2800448	But regardless, the point that I was trying to make is that if they're going to be smart about this, they'll have all the games come on already.
2801408	2814877	I wouldn't say fully localized, but they will have menus or, you know, even work with, you know, between the Japanese staff and American staff for two country developers.
2814917	2815378	You know what I mean?
2816518	2821541	and then release a version that's got just everything in it already.
2822842	2823782	Okay, here's an example.
2823822	2830626	Sonic Adventure, when it came out in the US, had Japanese subtitles and Japanese voices in it and the English voices.
2831706	2832567	Can I ask this real quick?
2832587	2838490	Because Breakman's asking this in the chat room and this is a really good question that I'm not even sure I know the answer to this.
2839371	2844433	Breakman in chat asks, OLR, seriously, why is region locking so important to these companies?
2844753	2845394	What's the point?
2845994	2847635	And a part of it has to do with demographics.
2848035	2849075	It's licensing, right?
2849115	2849855	Yeah, licensing.
2850055	2853176	License stuff for certain regions.
2853316	2856998	You know, obviously, some of them, they just kind of don't put it in there.
2857138	2857818	Branding, too.
2858198	2858718	Branding, too.
2860899	2865060	I can see where, like, the NFL games, you know, NFL's very protective about their shit.
2865460	2867921	And so I'm sure those NFL games have to be region locked.
2867981	2868642	No, they're not.
2869262	2870022	What do you say that for?
2871172	2871813	DarkSakura.com
2890547	2895929	All the machines that you saw over here were being imported from Japan and they really technically weren't supposed to be.
2895989	2897410	They were quote unquote illegal.
2898350	2900691	But it was kind of one of those things they didn't really enforce.
2901112	2907134	Konami just kind of quietly turned their backs to it because, you know, obviously it was raising awareness for all the console versions.
2907154	2908855	And they did actually have an official U.S.
2908915	2909215	machine.
2909395	2909535	Right.
2909575	2911236	Those songs were licensed.
2911616	2912557	Dance Mania
2935914	2938715	So it's a little back and forth with Madden.
2938735	2942716	Well, Madden has been region-free the last couple games.
2944077	2945677	10 and 11 were both region-free.
2946137	2948518	NCAA football, though, in the U.S.
2948658	2950559	this year was not region-free.
2950619	2952599	It was only NCSC.
2954420	2958261	Then, for example, some games that are coming out that have already leaked out.
2959001	2971308	DSX, Human Revolution, Region 3, Colorado Warriors, The Cartel, that's also Region 3, Captain America was Region 3, Harry Potter was Region 3.
2974717	2976858	There was a Tour de France game that came out.
2977759	2982461	Not even in our region, but that's both region for PAL and NTSC.
2982881	2983621	Kind of funny there.
2984162	2985702	That's a game that's never coming out over here.
2986102	2989144	Not that I'd play it, but whatever.
2990364	2994886	UFC Personal Trainer, Naughty Bear Gold Edition, Dynasty Warriors 3.
2994926	2994986	I'm...
2996827	2999068	It's just a lot of games.
2999308	3001910	A lot of them are coming out all region.
3002570	3003951	They just don't really advertise it.
3004231	3010374	However, though, a lot of times you'll see the Japanese only games like Red Faction Armageddon in Japan as only a Japanese region game.
3010414	3012155	Same with like Shaun White and that kind of stuff.
3012935	3015576	But the versions that come out over here, I believe...
3018440	3019381	are all region.
3019421	3021463	In fact... Go into our chat room real quick again.
3021503	3022724	Chat.orange.studio.com.
3022764	3029849	Frisbee asks, but like, for example, if I buy a Japanese game from a website in Japan, would that affect licensing seeing as you buy it from that country?
3030810	3038396	I think in what you're talking about, I think you kind of answered your own question because, you know, when you're buying a game from Japan, well, your money went to a Japanese company.
3038556	3066127	I will tell you this most Japanese sites will not mail to the US like for example Amazon I've ordered you know I've ordered like a couple of books and a couple of CDs but other than that I haven't ever been able to order games from there they won't take your credit card information when I was ordering my because I had the money I was going to order my 2DX controller
3066727	3067208	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3074292	3080776	Some of these stores over here that sell the import stuff, the way they're doing it is that they have an alliance with a Japanese retailer who's feeding them all the goods.
3080996	3082417	I mean, that's how they do it.
3082637	3086519	Toys and Joys is out of Hawaii, so they actually bring stuff back.
3086579	3088160	That's how they get it really quickly.
3088280	3090902	A lot of companies are selling to these guys.
3090942	3094323	I'm assuming it's Japanese distributors for games and stuff like that.
3094724	3095384	It's basically...
3097165	3119667	as long as we're shipping to a country or a location within that country it doesn't really matter what you do with it we don't want to know what you do with it it's just if you're going to distribute it in another country you're not really supposed to do that but once again we're just selling it to that person what they do with it from there that's a whole other thing
3125044	3128830	It is kind of stupid that they have region locked stuff on there.
3129250	3133096	Quite the conversation we've had stemming from the Xbox 360 chat in Japan.
3133617	3134478	But let's move on.
3134518	3138003	We've got some more stories to cover here before we get to release dates and then the classic game of the week.
3138802	3141523	The PlayStation Vita, there's some more information that came out about it.
3142123	3148485	It was rumored that the RAM was halved to drop the price of the system so that it would be able to compete with the 3DS.
3148925	3150346	However, that is not true.
3151046	3156228	The PlayStation Vita actually has more RAM than the PlayStation 3 in some cases.
3157768	3158948	And also a few other things.
3159008	3160649	They also have cross-game chat.
3161509	3165710	And you can also do... I guess it's part of their party system.
3166411	3166571	The...
3168511	3182435	System has 512 MB of RAM and 128 MB of video RAM compared to the PlayStation 3's 256 MB of system RAM and 256 MB of video RAM.
3182515	3193758	While, of course, the RAM is smaller on the video side, the resolution isn't as great as the PlayStation 3, so it doesn't require as much RAM for textures and stuff as the PlayStation 3 does.
3194498	3219831	but definitely with that kind of RAM in there we'll allow a lot more flexibility with different games and stuff because I know a lot of people have to optimize their game and do different things and cut stuff just to have it run in the limited RAM so that's kind of cool so we'll see some pretty good games coming on that system I'm guessing because of that we can hope
3220956	3221577	That's good.
3221617	3223298	I guess RAM's getting cheaper overall, huh?
3223698	3224039	Oh, yeah.
3224119	3224839	It's dirt cheap.
3226261	3227261	All right.
3227321	3227662	Moving on.
3227702	3235388	Talking about the Vita and some of the other things that were announced for the Vita this week at Gamescom, PlayStation Vita is going to be getting some more social integration.
3236289	3243035	In fact, they're going to get some of the things that you usually hear about when you think about more of the iOS type of apps, or I guess you could say Android as well.
3243455	3246097	Things like Foursquare, Skype...
3246718	3255271	Twitter, Facebook, all of that is going to be in the PlayStation Vita and I guess that's part of what you can use the whole 3G and all that for.
3255291	3258196	Remember the AT&T 3G that everybody was really excited about?
3258760	3262921	All four of those apps, they're going to be free downloads from the PlayStation Network.
3264082	3270683	Doesn't quite say, you know, they didn't hint at if it's going to be at launch or if it's going to be a ways after that.
3270783	3274044	I imagine none of these apps are that complicated.
3274084	3275105	I'm sure they'll be out.
3275425	3283227	You know, what else is also interesting about them is I believe all of them, except maybe Skype, have open APIs, so they ought to be really easy to develop the apps.
3284628	3285869	Somebody to get in there and do them.
3285929	3290092	So I can't imagine it will be much further after launch if it's not at launch.
3292073	3295535	It could be, and some are theorizing that maybe they're just going to be right on the device when you get them.
3295876	3296896	You won't even have to download them.
3296916	3299818	They'll just be free and on the device waiting for you to use.
3299838	3300619	Wouldn't that be nice?
3301580	3302620	So there you go.
3302761	3304062	All that integration is going to be there.
3304082	3305063	What do you guys think?
3305163	3311288	I think Skype specifically is interesting, of course, because Skype is now a Microsoft product.
3311428	3320716	But I don't think that necessarily means that Skype is all things Microsoft and only all things Microsoft at this point anymore.
3321837	3322578	I just think that's it.
3322598	3326521	And that was probably something planned well before the purchase of Skype products.
3326741	3328923	but what about the rest of this integration?
3328983	3330384	Is this a good thing for the Vita?
3330484	3331645	Is this a bad thing?
3331725	3333926	Is this a no one really gives a shit type of thing?
3334347	3354502	That's kind of where I'm at with it is I'm like well I guess some of the things are cool like if you don't have an iPhone or an Android or one of the other phone devices that runs all this stuff but I mean I can't really see using Twitter on my PS Vita because like how often do I use Twitter on my Xbox 360?
3354662	3355102	Let me think.
3355282	3355642	Oh never.
3355663	3356203	Never.
3356523	3359206	I used it once to say, hey, I'm writing a tweet for my 360.
3359527	3360688	I think everybody did that.
3360708	3366755	Now, I think though that you would use it a bit more on like a Vita than you would say a 360 because you're taking it with you.
3366775	3367215	I agree.
3367316	3372161	At least the Vita's on the go with you and it makes more sense for things like Foursquare and so forth.
3372181	3373523	But again, I own an iPhone.
3373623	3374504	I don't need it on a Vita.
3375790	3395099	but I understand not everybody's like me you might have a college kid who doesn't really want to pay the amount you have to pay a month to have an iPhone so they have like a cheaper phone that you know just gets the calling job done calling and texting and the basics and then you know we'll have the Vita to do all this fancier stuff like the check-ins and so forth Facebook
3396039	3422730	status updates I'm thinking this also paves the way for you know I don't know this I don't know how I feel about this in a lot of games but it will pave the way for games to automatically post to your Facebook and your Twitter I just got to level 3 whoopee they already have that in a lot of stuff I know they do but not as much as I would think and especially like you don't see it in any 3DS games that I know of um
3425120	3426581	And if they are, they're not first party.
3427242	3428963	There's a DS game I know that has that.
3429184	3431846	Okay, like one DS game, right?
3432426	3434308	You don't see it in a lot of the games right now.
3434648	3438532	Whereas I think including this stuff on the PS Vita kind of opens the door for more of that stuff.
3439882	3440822	Do people want that?
3440902	3445964	Do people really want their Twitter to just be filled up with, yay, I unlocked a trophy.
3446024	3446324	Whoopee.
3446564	3457288	I mean, I guess I have the trophy stuff post to my Facebook, which I kind of show that more as a way to kind of tell people what games I'm really into right now without having to put an update.
3457348	3459789	But some of it's really cumbersome.
3460049	3462190	I would not want updates to go up.
3462210	3465591	You can have your thing announced to Facebook every time you download something.
3465631	3466791	That's retarded.
3466891	3467952	I mean, ridiculous.
3467992	3468712	That's too much.
3469832	3481062	Porn, porn, porn, porn Breakman in our chatroom says Can I get a Vita that just plays video games?
3481202	3482083	Can it be cheaper then?
3482203	3488489	Yes, please Breakman also says Fucking Facebook, can I pay extra to have that not installed?
3492119	3492459	Yikes.
3492539	3496763	No word on Google Plus, or as we call it on Horde House, Google Positive.
3496864	3500827	No word if Google Positive will be one of the apps that will be on the PlayStation Vita.
3501568	3504291	Also, one other quick thing I've got to say about the Vita.
3504411	3510176	Apparently, one other thing that they're saying, every PlayStation Vita game will also be downloadable.
3510456	3513739	To what storage on the PlayStation Vita?
3513800	3516122	Because there is no storage on the PlayStation Vita.
3516142	3517203	The Vita memory cards.
3517958	3521380	Yeah, why would I buy the game?
3522100	3522560	Think about this.
3524161	3531204	Not only can you buy the cartridge version of the game, for the same price you can download it off the internet.
3532310	3533952	and you can buy a memory card to put it on.
3535193	3536375	Why would I do that?
3536435	3537496	That's stupid.
3537936	3538777	Why would you do that?
3539038	3542261	And no, I guarantee there's not going to be a discount for buying it online.
3542361	3543863	There never is a fucking discount.
3544003	3545825	Well, what if you're a PlayStation Plus subscriber?
3546666	3547687	Maybe you'll get a discount.
3547707	3547927	Please.
3548408	3548728	Come on.
3549169	3549990	Okay, so...
3552367	3552827	I don't know.
3552847	3554007	That's just stupid.
3555388	3562470	But what if, Loki, what if you have to have the game right now and I'm so fat that I can't fit in my car anymore?
3563130	3567591	So I will not be able to drive to the store to get it, but I have to have the game right now.
3569432	3570072	Well, that's great.
3570132	3574313	You can also purchase a digital copy that you can't resell.
3575914	3579217	It's all used again, so, you know.
3581058	3583060	And it will cost you more money because you have to buy a memory card.
3583841	3585162	That's win-win for Sony.
3585182	3587924	But at least I didn't have to buy the gas to get down to Best Buy.
3587944	3589366	Oh, yeah, come on.
3590406	3593609	If the gas is that much of a problem for you, and you know what?
3594310	3594430	You...
3597935	3600097	I'm sorry, gas is not that expensive yet.
3600877	3604220	It's not going to cost you a gallon of gas to get down there.
3604300	3609484	And I guarantee that memory card, it's going to be more than a few bucks.
3609704	3610565	It's probably like $15.
3610605	3613287	Well, TigerClaw in our chat is saying memory cards are cheap nowadays.
3614744	3619307	Yeah, regular memory cards are cheap nowadays, but this is Sony's proprietary memory card.
3619628	3641124	Just like, you know, Microsoft has their, it's not even really proprietary, it's a proprietary case that we put a laptop hard drive in that we can charge a lot more money for, or our memory cards, or even, hell, they've gone to the point where they're like, hey, we got some USB memory cards that you can use that, you know, I know you can use any thumb drive out there that's, you know, really cheap, but ours are $50.
3641184	3641304	Yeah.
3642706	3644656	for four gigs or whatever it was.
3644676	3645561	It's like, come on.
3646499	3651120	That's like the Nintendo Wii SD cards.
3652641	3659882	The Wii will take any SD card, but if you want to get a Nintendo Wii SD card that has a little sticker that says Nintendo Wii on it, it costs like twice as much.
3660062	3661863	I can make a sticker that says Wii, by the way.
3661883	3667004	And they're just like SanDisk cards or something like that, but they're actually like another company that makes them, obviously.
3668825	3674086	It's just, unless you're getting some sort of discount on it, like it's half the price.
3675788	3705165	then I see no reason to do this which Sony may do those kinds of crazy sales online or and see I don't understand why they have well I understand why they have proprietary memory cards because they don't want people hacking the system but at the same time and I was kind of shocked because I had to buy my mom a camera a Sony camera and I'm like okay and he's like okay you can pick one of these new memory cards here and they're like you know SDHD cards I'm like wait a second uh don't I have to get a memory stick no they stopped using memory stick a while ago I'm like the
3706212	3707373	Thank God!
3707493	3709996	Get with the program using a common format.
3711798	3720227	So that was kind of cool that they had that, but I don't understand why they don't take those anyways on top of their... Well, I understand, once again, it's piracy.
3720247	3723010	They're worried about people pirating games.
3724719	3725619	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3747850	3750211	Nintendo says I'm sorry.
3750772	3751572	My bad.
3752452	3762357	Basically, when Xenoblade came out in the UK, if you pre-ordered in a store, you'd get an exclusive classic controller.
3762738	3763258	It was red.
3763778	3767920	And you could get three A1 size posters signed by the developer.
3768681	3773003	But they did not specify that if you did your pre-orders online, you would not be getting the posters.
3774807	3776968	And they said, Oops!
3777928	3785932	If you previously placed an online pre-order to get these posters sent with your copy of the pre-order bundle, please get in contact with Game or GameStation using links.
3785952	3786733	Yeah, they've got links on there.
3787053	3796898	So basically, if you're in the UK and you pre-ordered online and wanted your poster and were under the impression you'd be getting a poster, contact the retailer and tell them that Nintendo sucks.
3797018	3798378	It's just a fucking poster.
3799439	3802040	And it's not even personally signed.
3802080	3803941	It's digitally signed by the developer.
3804381	3805983	So it's basically photoshopped on there.
3806043	3807885	They did not have their pens out.
3808666	3809987	It's photoshopped.
3810068	3812270	It was the RoboPen is what it was.
3812310	3813551	Just like Obama used to sign bills.
3813571	3814112	DigiPen.
3814573	3815694	Is that what the DigiPen?
3816375	3817816	Well, you know, there's a company, DigiPen.
3819158	3820059	It's photoshopped.
3822515	3822815	Oops!
3824096	3824716	So, yeah.
3824876	3826837	But still, I mean, I get it, though.
3827077	3838942	As much as I'm giving these people a hard time for being mad about their posters, I understand the fact that it is principle, and I understand the fact that Nintendo hasn't been making a lot of smart decisions lately, so why not, you know, kick a little more dirt at them?
3839242	3842083	And if you pre-order it online in America, you're just not getting the game.
3846104	3854777	but here's a lovely poster you can have as a parting gift alright, let's move on to travel the world and look at some release dates and what's coming out to a store near you quite soon
3855250	3855871	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3880092	3886678	including now Super Mario Galaxy, Super Paper Mario, Super Mario Strikers Charged, and Punch-Out!!
3887138	3888520	all for $19.99.
3889440	3890161	That's it.
3891482	3892223	Oh, I'm sorry.
3892443	3895826	Shin Megami Tensei Devil Survivor overclocked for the 3DS.
3896206	3900170	Although I thought that was coming out the week after next, but whatever.
3902327	3904908	Alright, well, sounds like an exciting week in the US.
3905048	3908408	Let's move to Japan and see how exciting it is over there and their releases.
3909269	3911909	Pretty much the same story, except they don't even have Deus Ex.
3912710	3916670	They get Dirt 3 this week in Japan on August the 25th.
3916730	3917831	That's coming out on the Xbox 360.
3918191	3922732	I'm sure we're going to start to see those Xbox 360 releases get scaled back quite a bit.
3923512	3925974	On the PlayStation 3, though, they have Dirt 3 as well.
3926074	3928075	I guess this is probably the big game.
3928695	3932838	Monster Hunter Portable 3rd HD version coming out on the PlayStation 3.
3933198	3936360	Wasn't this this whole PSP game getting remade for the PS3?
3936520	3936740	Yes.
3936880	3938741	Yes, that is finally hitting the shelves this week.
3939261	3941523	I have a friend who's so psychotic about that game.
3941543	3945825	I was going to say that that's probably the big thing people are excited about this week in Japan.
3946466	3951929	But some people might also be into the Koei games and Sengoku Musou 3 Empires.
3951949	3952269	Yes.
3952549	3953690	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3980424	3996844	that's really it on the PlayStation 3 but I will mention on the Sony PSP there's Black Rock Shooter the game is out this week on the PSP there's lots of special editions one of them comes with this cute little figurine little anime character dressed in white there
3997604	3998165	I kind of like that.
3998185	3999645	It looks like a Vinylmation figure.
4000146	4007209	And the game itself, I don't know, I'm just looking at the screenshots, I don't know, it's kind of like Sin and Punishment slash RPG-ish to me, so that's that.
4007270	4016034	Black Rock Shooter on the Sony PSP, as well as Mobile Suit Gundam, Shingire no Yabu, because it's just not a Japanese month without a new Gundam game.
4017555	4019776	And I believe that is pretty much it for releases.
4019816	4023498	I'm trying to look at the 3DS real quick to see if there's anything of note there.
4025359	4026020	Not this week.
4027603	4028584	So, shall we go to Europe?
4028704	4028904	Yep!
4029565	4050439	On the 23rd, we have Call of Dirty Black Ops Resurrection on Xbox 360, and on the 24th, Hamilton's Great Adventure, Street Fighter 3 Third Strike, Tropico 4, and then on the 26th, which is Friday, there's Pac-Man and Galaga Dimensions, Rugby World Cup 2011, and Deus Ex Human Revolution.
4051300	4051740	Yay!
4051760	4051820	Yay!
4053979	4054239	Sweet.
4054780	4055060	All right.
4055601	4058784	Let's get a couple more stories in before we get to the classic game of the week.
4058885	4059125	Loki.
4059946	4060106	Yes.
4061087	4065872	We talked about the new PSP that's coming to Europe that has Wi-Fi removed.
4066393	4068775	Well, Nintendo not to be outdone by Sony.
4069076	4075203	They're removing some other stuff in the brand new Wii that is coming out in the UK regions as well.
4076183	4080927	The value Wii for that region will be coming out.
4081207	4082788	They haven't really given a price yet.
4082828	4083989	It's supposed to be cheaper.
4085270	4088433	It is designed to sit horizontally instead of vertically.
4089533	4096899	And apparently the GameCube backwards compatibility, both accessories and games, has been removed.
4099464	4101787	What a great feature.
4102108	4104631	Do out sometime before Christmas.
4105392	4109056	It's going to include, I guess, a Wii Remote Plus, Nunchuck, Wii Party, and Wii Sports.
4109677	4111940	Wii Party, wow, that is a throwaway game.
4111980	4113822	They must have had a bunch of extra copies of that.
4116766	4117727	Yeah, fun times.
4119088	4120869	Well, let's be real, though.
4121129	4123490	How many people are still emulating GameCube games?
4123710	4128091	I can think, and I know as the minute I said that, the chat room's going to light up with this.
4128171	4130672	I can think of one that I play, and that's F-Zero.
4130812	4131132	That's it.
4131172	4131473	All right.
4132033	4134033	And they really just need to give that a proper week, at least.
4134053	4134254	All right.
4134514	4135014	Fair enough.
4135394	4138555	But here's going to be the argument, and I'm sure a lot of people in chat are going to make this.
4139015	4143397	A lot of games, they have the support for playing with a GameCube controller.
4143897	4161364	for example, Smash Brothers or Mario Kart and that kind of stuff and a lot of people refer the GameCube controller or WaveBird or whatever to the Wii Remote steering and that kind of bullshit that they have so that's what a lot of people are probably pissed off about because they don't want to use the classic controller I'll give you that
4164788	4174803	All they would have to do is create some sort of WaveBird thing that plugs you into either wirelessly or tethered to the Wii Remote.
4175123	4176205	And boom, everyone's happy.
4176943	4181565	But the audience that needs something like that is probably not the same audience that this console is geared at.
4181645	4186586	I mean, this is really about getting the Wiis into homes that don't already have them, which aren't a lot by now.
4187466	4187687	Right?
4187967	4189327	And this is only coming out in Europe again.
4190267	4191868	At least they say it's not coming out here.
4192528	4194889	I still say PAX next week could change a lot of things.
4195469	4198650	But I'll go with it and say that it's only probably coming out in Europe right now.
4199110	4199290	Yeah.
4199831	4200371	As of right now.
4200931	4201091	So...
4203647	4214203	but yeah I mean the GameCube compatibility thing probably isn't too surprising do you think that maybe you know since we talked earlier in the show about hacking and stuff that they've tried to take measures to combat all that
4216022	4217483	Um, no.
4218644	4220565	But here's something interesting, though.
4221525	4235793	They're basically saying other bundles will also be forthcoming, and they also got word that Nintendo will focus on the new Wii bundles going forward, suggesting it won't coexist with the current model.
4237685	4242506	So they're going to be removing it out of all of the systems going forward.
4243286	4245527	They already did and they didn't even make better graphics.
4245547	4246027	They just put Wii...
4265871	4266751	You know, controls in there.
4266771	4268112	Remember new play control stuff?
4268352	4269512	That didn't sell very well.
4269532	4270772	That's why you don't see them anymore.
4270852	4277454	I'm going to go a step further and say when the Wii U virtual console stuff hits, you're probably going to start seeing some of the GameCube stuff pop up on there.
4277774	4281375	And then maybe that's why they're starting to try and phase GameCube accessibility out.
4281495	4284716	But Breakman has a really good point in chat room, and I kind of agree with this.
4284736	4286717	The original GameCube is one of the sturdiest systems.
4287137	4289037	Yeah, those GameCubes are kind of hard to break.
4289457	4291738	I didn't know anybody that ever had a broken GameCube.
4292318	4292759	The disc's not so much.
4310276	4310916	So, anyhow.
4311516	4312797	Alright, well, there you go.
4312857	4315657	I guess a new Wii for the three people that don't have one yet.
4316337	4319678	Meanwhile, who knows of a game called Steel Battalion?
4320338	4321019	I do.
4321379	4323999	Tell the listeners what Steel Battalion is, if they've never heard of it.
4324299	4330001	It's a huge war sim where you're a mecha, and it has this huge mongus controller, of which we have two now.
4331442	4334146	Um, and when the controller came out it was like 300 bucks.
4334486	4335047	It was expensive.
4335067	4338231	Because the controller was literally a dynamic, it was a console.
4338271	4340875	It was panels and switches and the red button.
4341035	4343439	It was like what you would see inside an actual mech.
4343519	4344520	It was pretty crazy.
4344641	4345061	It was.
4345221	4346303	It was crazy go nuts.
4346383	4346864	Heavy Armor
4364944	4369368	Apparently, you will be able to use Kinect and the standard Xbox 360 controller.
4369709	4379840	The controller will be used for movement, aiming, and firing, but the Kinect camera will use upper body gestures that you can use to start the engine, use a turret gun, use the scope.
4380160	4383564	You can communicate verbally with the crew members if you want as well.
4383844	4386327	They talk specifically in the release about
4386627	4387407	High fives.
4388868	4398193	So it sounds like they're bringing all these buttons and things that do stuff into a whole new realm, which sounds funny to me.
4398273	4398573	I don't know.
4398593	4399493	I think it's going to be fun.
4399653	4406597	But honestly, the fun I think of the original was you had all the buttons and all the neat little stuff to push.
4407150	4408591	My favorite was the eject button.
4408611	4410292	I like to just push that button for fun.
4410893	4419779	But it was the fact that instead of moving your hand or doing something, you got to push the damn button.
4419879	4423961	Wasn't that the fun of it that you had the whole console there?
4423981	4424902	That's true.
4424962	4426623	I do like to push buttons.
4426663	4431426	They need to release a peripheral for the Kinect that's just a board with buttons on it that I can push.
4431606	4432387	Bubble wrap the game.
4432407	4432847	Yeah.
4435257	4435917	Oh, wait, wait, wait.
4435977	4438978	I don't need buttons anymore because I have the Kinect, and that's what it's all about.
4439259	4440319	I like my buttons.
4441960	4442720	I like the buttons.
4443480	4444701	I want to push the red one.
4445261	4445841	I push it.
4446541	4448742	All right, let's get to the classic game of the week.
4450663	4459306	Every week here on the program, DarkSakura dives into the gaming vault and says, Hey, back in my day, we pushed a lot of buttons, and you're going to be pushing my buttons if you don't try this game.
4459346	4460527	It's the classic game of the week.
4460547	4463528	DarkSakura, what did you pick as the classic game of the week?
4464241	4466362	The classic game of the week is Midnight Resistance.
4466882	4468322	Woo, we can all thank Dan for this.
4468342	4470102	Because I was like, Dan, help me think of a game.
4470843	4471683	Midnight Resistance.
4471963	4472283	Okay.
4473303	4484886	So it is a side-scrolling action shooting game that Data East put out in the arcade in 1989 and came out on the Mega Drive, also known as the Genesis, in 1990.
4485106	4487747	It was put out by Ocean Software US.
4488507	4491368	It is in the future where everything sucks.
4492268	4503215	and you're a member of a resistance movement dude who has to rescue his family from a mad scientist before he turns them into donkeys or something.
4503235	4503616	Not really.
4504977	4505257	Anyway.
4505377	4507078	Basically it's Contra but not.
4507338	4508739	Yeah, it's Contra but not.
4509239	4511301	And you can do two players simultaneous.
4512802	4513323	Nantra.
4514284	4519150	Okay, that's what Loki said without talking to his mic.
4520192	4529584	But anyway, it had a rotatable joystick that's like the one used in Ikari Warriors, which is why this is a hard game to emulate unless you've got an arcade controller.
4531426	4540694	At any rate, you also had your shoots and jumps and you would use your little dial to adjust your aim as you went along.
4542976	4546740	So you could keep moving in directions but change your aim.
4546820	4547481	It was pretty neat.
4548241	4552686	And it had a power-up system that was like a heavy barrel, which was also a Data East game.
4553426	4563011	where you would collect keys after defeating enemies and you'd get six keys at a time and then you could enter weapon storage and pick out different weapons and power-ups and stuff.
4564171	4578898	Your main weapons that you could get were... You could replace your default rifle with backpack weapons that are launched so you'd actually push the joystick and press the shoot button to do it at the same time.
4580059	4581200	You had different special guns.
4581220	4584343	You had a supercharge upgrade that would increase your firepower.
4584983	4589408	And a barrier that gives you invincibility temporarily and extra lives.
4589428	4591570	There's nine stages with different obstacles.
4592030	4596234	And right before the final stages, you use your keys.
4596755	4599777	But you have to battle the Crimson King.
4600378	4603321	And the ending depends on how many of your family members you rescued.
4604927	4605908	Oh, it came out for home.
4607449	4613655	Like I said, it was published by Data East for the Mega Drive in Japan.
4614496	4624345	And it's very close to the arcade version, except, of course, the controllers, since it's just a Genesis pad, you couldn't have the rotatable thing, so you had four different button configurations.
4625426	4627268	Your default controllers will let you...
4629970	4630230	Fuck yes.
4630370	4630830	Fuck yes.
4648857	4651138	I had a feeling that you were familiar with this game, Rob.
4651158	4653978	How in the fuck you did this game on the Commodore 64, I have no idea.
4655039	4656179	Can I look up a YouTube of that?
4656219	4657339	I gotta see this on the C64.
4657359	4663061	There's the ZX Spectrum, the Amstrad CPC, Commodore Amiga, and the Atari ST.
4664541	4666041	Some development done by Special FX.
4666942	4675764	And actually, one thing, Rob, is that this is listed as one of the greatest games ever made for that system.
4677714	4678855	Go back and play the previous one.
4699335	4700076	Oh, the actual music?
4700416	4702098	Yeah, just to... Sure, sure, sure.
4702658	4703379	Let me jump in here.
4703399	4705361	So you see, it's... I think it's pretty playful.
4705381	4705801	Yeah, yeah.
4712602	4717224	Oh, for the Spectrum, by the way, it was completely redesigned and done really cartoony.
4718405	4726348	And it had push-screen scrolling and very few colors, but it's considered to be one of the best games on the system.
4727568	4728169	And that's it.
4728209	4729049	That's Midnight Resistance.
4730333	4732154	Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week.
4732354	4736216	Midnight Resistance for the, what system specifically?
4736236	4736376	Arcade?
4736436	4739138	I'm talking about Arcade, but we'll also include the home releases.
4739298	4743760	Alright, so the Arcade slash Mega Drive slash C64 slash... Other stuff.
4743860	4744921	A bunch of British systems.
4745121	4745701	Alright, there you go.
4746521	4747322	Your classic game of the week.
4747842	4748263	Good pick.
4748643	4751446	I've actually not heard of that game, but it looks kind of interesting.
4752707	4754589	Here I thought I knew every game that was on the Commodore 64.
4754729	4760335	That's why I thought you would be very interested, because Lotted is one of the best games for the Commodore 64.
4760876	4766922	Well, every fucking game that was released in the 80s in the arcades came out on the Commodore 64 at some point.
4766942	4768424	You have to give it a go.
4768544	4770246	There was a lot of games on Commodore 64, I'm telling you.
4770771	4774533	We're going to take a quick break, guys, but we'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio after this.
4774853	4775394	Stay tuned.
4775434	4783498	Of course, we've got more information on VidRhythm, Harmonix's next project we're going to talk about in the next segment, as well as Diablo 3 and some of the rumors with that.
4783759	4789282	And then, of course, your calls, your tweets, and much more when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4795290	4797811	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
4811315	4814938	I don't know about you guys, but I think that's pretty awesome
4836815	4837295	Luminous 2 Luminous 3
4857032	4863156	I really liked... Well, I had a Missy Elliott song and a Beck song.
4863336	4863877	The first one.
4863897	4867139	I was going to say, my favorite, though, is still the first one.
4867459	4868960	Yeah, that's fair.
4869360	4871002	But it's probably better.
4871142	4873363	Both of them are probably better than the Xbox One, in my opinion.
4873943	4877266	It's just the controller on the Xbox Two is so... Oh, yeah.
4877886	4878286	It's rough.
4879187	4883590	Still surprised to this day they have never tried to really correct the Xbox 360 D-pad.
4883910	4884851	In this country, anyway.
4884871	4884951	Yeah.
4885191	4889236	Other than selling it as a premium monochrome controller that, you know.
4889296	4890397	Wasn't that only available in Europe?
4890417	4891559	No, it's over here.
4891859	4892079	Really?
4892119	4892500	Was it really?
4892540	4893521	They still sell it today.
4893821	4894082	Really?
4894162	4896665	It's more expensive than the regular controller.
4896685	4897145	Of course.
4897365	4897746	Of course.
4898407	4898627	All right.
4898647	4900930	Well, let's get into some rapid fire news.
4900990	4902772	Some quick, quick news stories for you guys.
4903333	4905035	And we're going to cover quite a bit here.
4905135	4905355	Loki.
4906024	4906625	Hey, guess what?
4906645	4913530	Nintendo announced the launch of their largest title for the Wii, maybe even to date.
4914911	4918554	Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword will be out in North America November 20th.
4918574	4920496	So you can mark that down.
4920556	4921496	I guess that is holiday.
4921997	4928182	And, of course, it will require Motion Plus, which, you know, God, by now you probably have something that's Motion Plus.
4928302	4930003	Actually, I still don't have a Motion Plus.
4930063	4930584	Is that sad?
4930624	4932025	Well, you're going to play the game then.
4933869	4935891	Go buy Wii Party Motion or something like that.
4936211	4938513	Get a free crappy game with Thermo.
4942202	4942942	This is kind of cool.
4943462	4948064	There's some portal turrets coming to Bastion on Steam.
4948584	4948865	Really?
4949245	4949505	Yes.
4949865	4952946	Apparently they've got some cool stuff.
4954066	4966071	There's a quest exclusive for the Steam version of Bastion where the kid uses a gel canister marked with the Aperture Science logo that contains a vicious substance of unknown origin.
4966971	4975215	and if you use that friendly portal turrets will come into battle and they will shoot enemies for you.
4975355	4980237	Bobby actually sent me a YouTube of this earlier in the night so I don't know if this is going to have narration in it.
4980257	4981377	Let me try to play this YouTube.
4981838	4982658	That's the narrator.
4986633	4987734	So, let's see.
4987754	4989796	Oh yeah, there's the turrets.
4989956	4990637	Are they talking?
4990657	4990837	Yeah.
4990877	4991438	That's fantastic.
5012250	5013692	Yeah, that's not in the 360 version.
5017138	5018000	Oh yeah, they're talking.
5018140	5018561	That's cool.
5022106	5024931	Scumbags don't take kindly to interlopers.
5032102	5033522	Now they're all over on this screen.
5033962	5034743	It's pretty cool.
5038843	5042244	I think they're kind of patching different parts of the game together.
5042664	5043845	The music's great in this game.
5044105	5044725	I like this game.
5045405	5047705	It's part of the reason I'm pissed my Xbox got hacked.
5048045	5049126	I'd like to be playing this right now.
5049206	5050146	So there you go.
5050166	5051146	Clip from Bastion plus Portal.
5060191	5060511	Boobz
5077567	5091287	I was talking about 3D websites and how they need websites with boobs I remember talking about this and Bobby said he was going to go make the website even it was like 3dboobies.com or something I don't remember what we called it I swear this came up like last week on the show
5091812	5113322	Well, apparently, the Half-Minute Hero designer, Kenny Chiro Takaki, he has set out to create a 3DS game based on, I guess, I don't know if it's an anime or whatever, but anyways, it's called Senran Kaguru, or Kagura, I'm sorry.
5113342	5113422	Okay.
5113742	5118946	And it's basically female ninjas with giant breasts.
5119947	5123849	And the game will be on sale in Japan September 22nd.
5124670	5126591	Don't plan on seeing that coming out over here.
5126691	5131014	But yeah, they've got a trailer for it.
5131254	5134116	It doesn't really show too much.
5134156	5136718	I mean, it's just kind of this anime intro thing.
5137339	5137759	And then...
5139680	5152828	and lots of innuendo, like all of them sucking on stuff right now and large boobs and she's pulling out stuff from her boobs and yeah, lots of breasts.
5153608	5155710	Oh, and panty shot.
5158611	5159972	You say this like it's a bad thing.
5160032	5162994	I mean, this is really what people want a 3DS for, right?
5163714	5164595	I think it's welcomed.
5166334	5168855	Alright, let's move on to some other news.
5168875	5171217	This has to do with a game coming to PlayStation Network.
5171237	5175119	It's a revival of an old arcade game, Elevator Action Deluxe.
5175999	5179321	Yes, apparently there's a new PlayStation Network version.
5179381	5181322	It's an HD update of the old game.
5181922	5183763	I don't know if you've ever played this game.
5183803	5187005	If you have the original Elevator Deluxe, look up some of the clips on YouTube.
5187045	5187985	I know it was on the NES.
5188065	5192968	It was very popular back in the day, so I'm sure you guys probably will recognize this when you see some YouTubes of it.
5193468	5218717	but the new version on PlayStation Network of course not just an HD you know upgrade and so forth but there's going to be new new weapons faster elevators multiplayer modes that are available offline including deathmatch and other competitive modes so that'll be kind of neat I guess ten dollars for that I don't know I always kind of thought elevator action was overrated I did not think it was that great of a game as far as like classic games go I think it's one of the uh
5219796	5220696	I'm With The Chili Peppers
5240922	5241542	Well, why not?
5241562	5242443	I'll just do all the songs.
5242603	5252108	By the way, Californication, Look Around, Monarchy of Roses, Other Side, Parallel Universe, Scar Tissue, and The Adventures of Rain Dance Maggie.
5252808	5258031	Of course, the usual rock band pricing of $1.99 on the Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3.
5258451	5259572	August 30th is when it's going to come out.
5259852	5266075	Keep in mind, if the Red Hot Chili Pepper song you were hoping for wasn't in that list, there's already quite a few in the main game.
5266135	5269137	So you'd better check the master song lists.
5270353	5270853	Matt Black
5290103	5291544	We'll see you next time.
5310493	5316538	Those will be making their way to retailers over the coming weeks, and certainly if you're getting one of these for the holiday, you'll probably have one of those with the matte finish.
5317339	5319180	Alright, DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
5319561	5319941	Stuff.
5321042	5329549	Mega Man X2 actually has been given an ESRB rating for the Wii, so meaning that we should have it on the Virtual Console at some point, and it's E for everyone.
5330169	5330349	Aww.
5331730	5333652	You know that's the one that has the Shoryuken in it, right?
5335732	5348464	and for 3DS, Tekken 3D Prime Edition is actually going to come with apparently it's going to come with Blood Vengeance which is that movie.
5348484	5352087	It's going to be included on the cartridge.
5353148	5354570	So that sounds like it'll be cool.
5354590	5360075	So you're actually going to be watching something and it's part of the PS3 bundle for the record which I really want to see it.
5360855	5364319	and then, last but not least, LittleBigPlanet 2 Move Pack.
5364439	5366040	Here's what's going to be in it.
5366681	5379153	It has a brand new story for LittleBigPlanet 2 called The Rise of the Cakeling, five levels, seven minigames, two cutscenes, a new power-up for Sackboy called the Brain Crane, three move gadgets, the Moveinator, the Move Recorder, and the Paint Tool.
5380354	5399905	Four interactive music tracks, eight music sequencer tracks, a new sound object containing 32 new sounds, 17 new music sequencer instruments, a new level background, six new costumes, 18 materials, 41 decorations, 31 objects, 66 stickers, 39 new LittleBigPlanet pins, 11 brand new PlayStation trophies, and a partridge in a pear tree.
5400485	5402927	No price yet, but it will be out on September 14th.
5404483	5406184	I still need to buy LittleBigPlanet 2.
5406244	5406944	Isn't that sad?
5407524	5408125	Rob!
5408445	5409445	Well, I keep waiting.
5409505	5411546	I keep holding out for a price reduction.
5411626	5413507	Loki, you do the retail thing.
5413547	5418410	Do you think there'll be one that has the move crap bundled in with it for a cheaper price?
5418950	5422271	They'll do probably... Well, they did with the first one, a Game of the Year edition.
5422291	5423332	Yes, that's what I'm waiting for.
5425309	5436033	I don't think that's going to happen this year, though, because it's... Last one came out a year after the first one came out, and I believe... What's the little big planet, too?
5436053	5436674	Was that this year?
5436834	5437834	That was January, I think.
5438735	5439395	What's that last year?
5439815	5442176	It was... I think it had been pushed to this year.
5442196	5442756	That was this year.
5442937	5443497	It was this year.
5443537	5444237	Early this year.
5445298	5450220	So, yeah, I don't think that we're going to see that any cheaper.
5450320	5452241	I mean, it may price drop a little bit, but...
5454382	5455343	It'll be a while.
5457265	5458066	Alright, fine.
5458126	5461189	Probably when they have some more content packs for it.
5461509	5461950	Fine.
5462190	5462510	Alright.
5462990	5464051	Well, let's move on.
5464072	5467194	We're going to get back into some longer news and pretty soon the Skype line.
5467535	5472940	But first, I want to make sure I get at least one more plug in because we might be starting this segment when we get back.
5472980	5475502	It depends if I can get this particular people on the show or not.
5475562	5476143	But we
5476203	5484310	We are, again, trying very hard to feature indie games on the show and are hoping to begin that around the Labor Day show, which will be, of course, the show when we get back.
5485331	5499103	If you are an indie developer yourself or you know someone who's an indie developer who needs help getting the word out on the game and you think the game is unique and special and needs a little help standing out in the Xbox Live marketplace, since Microsoft won't help you, we will.
5499923	5525009	or even if it's an iOS game or a PC game or wherever it is drop me an email rob at orangelaunchradio.com that's me personally or you can always email the show if you'd rather mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com and we will try to get to your game to feature it as an indie game on the show and even if we don't get a lot of bite on that we're probably just going to start the spotlights very soon so look forward to that
5525731	5526252	DarkSakura.com
5546229	5550912	DarkSakura will be back with a second podcast hopefully very soon, something I'm joining her with.
5551353	5551513	Yes.
5551913	5558797	Again, Labor Day-ish once all this stuff settles because there's a lot going on personal life for Jamie and Dan right now.
5559237	5560838	Real life is intruding violently.
5561019	5563260	We had to delay it a little bit, but it's still on the radar.
5563400	5564741	So sorry we keep announcing.
5564781	5567803	We've been announcing that for like six weeks now, but things happen.
5567963	5570104	But we've got like show roles and everything and stuff ready.
5570264	5570765	I know, I know.
5571365	5572225	We know what we're doing.
5572286	5572866	We're ready to go.
5572926	5574147	It's just a matter of doing it.
5574247	5574387	Yeah.
5574987	5576108	Alright, let's move on.
5576168	5577428	Let's get into some longer news.
5577468	5577709	Loki.
5578889	5582491	This is kind of creepy and interesting at the same time, I guess.
5582871	5586153	GameStop has been testing a console streaming service.
5587414	5590695	Right now, they're hoping to have a beta in place by the end of this year.
5591836	5602281	And right now, I mean, this shouldn't be a huge surprise because they bought a company called Spawn Labs, which they had their own game streaming box.
5602821	5603482	Basically,
5604683	5615676	this would stream console games so Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 games to smart devices and dedicated hardware and they're also tinkering with PC game streaming as well
5617583	5619064	I don't know, that's kind of creepy.
5620965	5630852	I guess this will be a service for people that are GameStop Power-Up Rewards members, and that demos will be provided.
5631652	5643980	And of course, the rest of the stuff, including pricing, is not known, and they're expected to have a full rollout by early next year, or I guess more details about early next year and a full rollout by middle of 2012.
5646786	5647567	It's interesting.
5648907	5655972	Eh, I don't care because it's GameStop and I already told you my feelings on them a few weeks ago and if you missed that whole little rant, I am boycotting them because I think they're a shitty company.
5656412	5658454	So I kind of don't care about this whole thing.
5659834	5663677	However, let me think of something nice I could say about this.
5664497	5672362	Competition is healthy and so these places like OnLive and so forth that are already offering something very similar, right?
5673363	5674684	The competition is a healthy thing.
5677069	5678450	This is GameStop you're talking about.
5678531	5681153	This is the monkey that's in the corner.
5681633	5683115	Basically the elephant in the room there.
5683835	5686398	They're the biggest... The monkey in the corner throwing poo at itself?
5686718	5687198	Yes, whatever.
5687479	5692303	They're the biggest retailer for video games out there in the marketplace right now.
5692343	5695066	They dictate to publishers what they do.
5695966	5697448	DarkSakura, DarkDeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5714527	5715568	That's what's going to be coming.
5715868	5718189	That's going to be disgusting.
5718729	5722470	By the way, that right there, just add that to the list.
5722730	5727572	If you are new to OLR, and I know we have a lot of people that work at GameStops and stuff like that.
5727652	5729172	My beef is not with the workers.
5729672	5734354	You guys have a thankless job, and I respect what you've got to do to pay the bills.
5734514	5736495	My problem is with the management of the company.
5736535	5736995	If you need...
5738276	5743038	information about what that all entails, look at what Loki just said, because that will probably be reality.
5743058	5752684	Because that's, I mean, when it comes down to dictating, I mean, perfect example, there'll be games that come out that are street dated.
5752824	5759588	Earth Defense Force, for example, you know, and Earth Defense Force was supposed to come out on Tuesday in July.
5760209	5760429	All right.
5761522	5773332	D3, they fucked up, they accidentally printed a date on the box that didn't coincide with that date that was on the actual packaging and what they've been communicated to all the different stores.
5774113	5784922	So, whereas a regular store would go, hey, wait a second, this date looks wrong, and they would contact D3 and D3 are like, oh yeah, that was a misprint, the street date is still the date we stated.
5786109	5790253	GameStop said, hey, you printed a different date on here that happens to be earlier.
5790413	5791434	We're going to use that date.
5792215	5793236	And you don't want us to put it out?
5793256	5793817	Well, fuck you.
5793857	5795098	We're just going to put it out anyways.
5796359	5800464	And even though that information wasn't communicated to all the other retailers out there, ah, fuck them.
5800584	5801164	We're GameStop.
5801184	5807070	We're going to put it out anyways because you put a date on here and we're adhering to the date that you put on this even though it is a misprint.
5807951	5820253	that's the type of company GameStop is they will do whatever cutthroat thing they need to do to be on top so if you like all the streaming services like on live and stuff well I hope they survive
5822889	5849291	Kaijudo in chat says why all the GameStop hate all they do is sell us games and they've been made buying games easier for people like me who don't like to shop online remember the 80s and how much Toys R Us and mom and pop shops would sell games an arm and a leg 90 plus dollars again I have to defer back to my earlier rant that would have been about three or four weeks ago because I really don't want to get into it again but there's plenty of other options plenty of other options so
5850660	5851920	That's all I'm gonna say about that for now.
5873487	5876888	GameStop is a company that has done some things to people I know that I don't like and I'm not going to support them.
5902280	5905463	And you're perfectly justified, I think.
5906143	5906483	I agree.
5906884	5907024	Yep.
5907955	5911016	So, let's move on to happier news, shall we?
5912257	5913577	Let's talk about VidRhythm.
5913857	5918779	VidRhythm is Harmonix's new video game franchise, music franchise.
5919900	5923061	And a lot of people were saying, ooh, maybe this will be like when they heard the title.
5923081	5926303	Because we heard the title because of a trademark or application or one of those things before.
5926963	5931725	And a lot of people were hoping, ooh, maybe it's like a new frequency or amplitude or something like that.
5931785	5933826	Like VidRhythm, like videos and stuff.
5934246	5936927	Well, it turns out that the game has been announced for...
5938092	5938512	IOS.
5939833	5950478	In a Gamasutra interview with Alex Rogopoulos, who's the Harmonix head honcho, he says that it's for the IOS and it's more of an app than a game.
5951199	5959323	Quote, we think there are a lot of creative opportunities with smartphones that we haven't really been able to focus on yet.
5959723	5962345	So we're looking forward to doing more in that space.
5963405	5963725	Hmm.
5964346	5969429	So it sounds like this may have something to do more so than just a game.
5970130	5972011	Maybe it has something to do with location.
5972531	5976214	Maybe it has something to do with pictures or videos that the phones can do now.
5976794	5977254	Who knows?
5977635	5978395	It could be interesting.
5979416	5980136	I have no idea.
5980156	5981997	I mean, a statement like that could really go anywhere.
5982058	5988582	Like, I don't know if it's just CEO speak blowing smoke up my ass that they're doing something new when they're really not.
5988682	5990083	It's just their take on something.
5990403	5992765	But then I go, but it's harmonics and harmonics.
5993725	5999468	and they kind of, I mean, Rock Band and keep in mind, they made the original Guitar Hero with Red Octane.
5999508	6002169	You know, that really was kind of something new.
6002850	6005971	And I know there's going to be the people that are like, but Guitar Freaks, Guitar Freaks.
6006411	6007012	Well, I'm sorry.
6007072	6013555	They took the risk of making that more mainstream for America that Konami refused to do time and time again.
6013595	6017417	That's why Harmonix succeeded here because they did what Konami refused to do.
6020218	6022279	Harmonix does what Konami don't do.
6022759	6023339	Something like that.
6023380	6025001	But let's face it, we're long past that.
6025281	6027042	That whole stuff is years old.
6027442	6029664	So now it's about, what is vidrhythm?
6031545	6031985	I don't know.
6032365	6032766	Vidrhythm...
6034164	6034484	I don't know.
6034504	6042093	I see in my mind that when he talks about we're trying to do things with smartphones that haven't been done, maybe it has something to do with location or picture.
6042113	6044055	I don't know why pictures keep coming to my mind.
6044456	6049561	But maybe somehow it has to do with pictures on your phone getting incorporated into the game.
6049802	6050142	I don't know.
6050723	6052385	But that alone sounds really cheesy.
6052485	6053105	So I don't know.
6053846	6057508	I guess we'll see more when the demo is out or what happens with it.
6057769	6064052	Of course, if it's iOS, then it'll be one of those things where they'll just be like, oh, it's coming out whenever Apple pushes it to the store, which could be like tomorrow.
6064873	6065353	So we'll see.
6066654	6068875	All right, let's move on to the mailbag.
6069096	6077641	Every week, DarkSakura dives into the mailbag headfirst and pulls out some emails that she thinks, hey, I should read this on the air.
6078001	6079102	Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
6079864	6080824	You wanna know what sucks?
6081004	6081185	What?
6081625	6101692	Is that the window I had the mailbag open in was closed Sorry, hold on, let me reopen it You better open that shit real fast Alright, I guess I can plug Twitter again real quick at the end of the show, because we'll be doing your Twitter topics Twitter.com slash OLR We will be doing the Skype line later The 800 number is back tonight, thank you very much So, uh, wait for that
6102028	6102588	Alright, here they are.
6103569	6103849	You ready?
6105210	6106271	No, I want to talk more.
6106411	6106751	Meh.
6108613	6110954	Um, and by the way, I'm not going to call you person.
6111375	6116779	Hey guys, thanks for the show, particularly to Rob for posting the podcast to the feed as quick as he's doing.
6117159	6119601	It really makes a difference for those of us who are unable to listen live.
6120241	6125045	At the top of the show, there was some angst about having mobile games that just aren't optimized for various...
6127046	6127186	Really?
6127206	6127346	Really.
6153892	6160974	Finally, with it being an open platform, there's a bunch of great apps for gamers who, like me, prefer a physical gamepad, even going so far as to use a Wiimote for our games.
6161435	6161875	For free.
6162275	6167797	A first-person shooter on my Zoom with the moat and nunchuck over Bluetooth is great for traveling.
6169326	6170628	Oh my god, I haven't had an horchata in forever.
6184938	6186739	I know a place that's open late that has them.
6187059	6187579	So good.
6188160	6192062	But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive, which is a Shakespeare quote.
6192122	6192622	He put it on there.
6193162	6196844	And that is from, I'm going to say Dr. Noir.
6197564	6199885	Did I miss a question in there?
6199905	6204528	I thought I heard a question about, we were talking about on the top of last week's show about the mobile games.
6205448	6206369	Or was it just a statement?
6206389	6207129	No, just a statement.
6207269	6207829	Okay, my bad.
6208330	6208990	The Android's better.
6210589	6211090	Whatever.
6211730	6212471	I'm glad you think so.
6213411	6214492	Last one, which is the only one.
6214713	6218316	Hey, OLR, SonicM88 here with another question for you wonderful folks.
6218936	6220978	No.
6220998	6220978	42.
6221338	6221839	Alright, fine.
6222419	6227503	I'm considering buying a few of my favorite games as downloadable games on Xbox via the Games on Demand service.
6227924	6232628	I'm very lazy and can totally justify the purchase because my biggest problem currently is getting off my ass to change games.
6233208	6233889	First world problems.
6235290	6235630	Right?
6236491	6237392	Here's the problem though.
6237512	6243059	I remember hearing stories a while back about a Tom Clancy game not being fully compatible with multiplayer.
6243499	6249026	Apparently the physical version was unable to play online multiplayer with the games on demand downloadable version.
6249106	6255534	In the Xbox marketplace, all I know of the games say is that they don't support online multiplayer whatsoever.
6255914	6256275	Try Wikipedia
6270994	6279319	or actually, I'm going to say the official Xbox forums because when shit like that is broken, you will hear the angry gamers and complaints on the official Xbox forum.
6279739	6281240	So all you have to do is read through one of those.
6281420	6283361	I vaguely remember what you're talking about.
6283461	6285202	I want to say that was fixed, though.
6285262	6287283	I think they did do some type of patch.
6287663	6291645	I don't think Microsoft is intentionally leaving that shit out, but let's face it.
6291705	6293726	The Games on Demand service is pretty lazy.
6294107	6299830	All they're doing is they're kind of doing what I talked about at the top of the show with the Wii hack.
6300591	6306907	you can load the things you load the disk into an image and Microsoft's basically selling you that image
6307801	6315945	It is literally the, when you take the disc and install it to your hard drive on your 360, it's literally that image that they're selling you.
6316185	6318966	Which is fine because it's legit.
6319286	6320386	It's not piracy.
6320767	6321667	It's through their store.
6321767	6322287	It's fine.
6323048	6330151	But that's, you know, essentially they don't do the extensive quality checks that are done when a game is first released.
6330211	6330991	Let's put it that way.
6331871	6359864	they might do some minimal quality checks but you know very minimal as you can see by that little story there but those sort of instances should be few and far between to the best of my knowledge those games are supposed to be playable online they're supposed to be just like copies of the regular games it's not supposed to be anything crazy or something Microsoft's locking you out of but I will say this you know if you know it's your money spend it how you want if downloading the game so you don't have to get up and put a disc in is that important to you then fine do it but
6361164	6378978	just don't be afraid to shop smart too and what I mean by that is don't assume that the price you see on Xbox downloadable is necessarily the cheapest what's more important to you getting up off the couch to change the disc or getting it cheapest you know because you might be able to find a used copy on eBay
6379538	6380179	Really cheap.
6380840	6385227	Or possibly you could even find Amazon is having a sale or Best Buy is having a sale.
6385447	6389794	Best Buy had a great Kinect sale a couple months ago where it was like buy one, get one free.
6390195	6393399	So always be on the lookout for things like that.
6394222	6422687	how come nobody told me about that but at the end of the day again it's your money spend it how you want and certainly I've downloaded my share of download games granted that's mostly the arcade stuff but I will say this when I had swine flu back in 09 I had swine flu I was out of work for 9 days I downloaded a game digitally because I was not allowed to leave my house for my doctor so I think in that case I might have a legitimate reason for having done that you know
6424687	6426648	I would have left my house anyway.
6426668	6430589	Give it to as many people as possible.
6431990	6432890	Who cares about co-workers?
6433470	6436691	I think it's actually pretty funny.
6437391	6438452	Just to make a quick mention.
6439612	6446214	That's actually where the source of most illness is from the workplace.
6448533	6454962	You know, since I have not been working, Rob, I've only been sick, like really sick, once.
6456244	6456745	Yeah, I know.
6458388	6459068	It's crazy.
6459469	6461469	Quarantined here in the safety of my home.
6462790	6463110	All right.
6464091	6464911	Let's move on.
6465091	6466472	Since that was the end of the email bag, right?
6467032	6467392	Yes, it was.
6467412	6468452	We need more emails.
6468913	6469813	Two emails.
6469933	6471014	That was a sad showing.
6471074	6473475	If I get 10 emails next week, Rob has to get me an Orchata.
6473495	6474915	I'm not going to do shit.
6475155	6475416	Okay.
6475556	6476296	Well, that's because you're not here.
6476436	6481798	And the week after, if we have 10 emails the week after, then I will get Rob an Orchata.
6481838	6482599	Okay.
6482859	6483479	Now we're talking.
6483499	6484800	And then Rob will get me an Orchata.
6484820	6485560	Okay.
6486981	6490624	Okay, 10 emails means horchata trading happens.
6490744	6492746	Yes.
6492826	6496749	Actually, it'll just be Mexican drink night here at Orange Lounge Radio.
6496950	6498251	You can get a tamarindo.
6498351	6499512	I'll go get some charritos.
6501353	6506097	I will get horchata, and then we can have some, what's that, apple soda?
6506977	6508218	That's what I'm thinking of, I think.
6510039	6518846	Yarritos makes the tamarind soda, and they have, I think the same company makes an apple soda, and they have like a lime soda.
6520027	6526191	And we'll go to Target and get the Coke that's actually from Mexico, that has like the real sugar in it.
6526704	6527184	and it's kosher.
6528625	6529405	There you go.
6531526	6533147	And then we'll drink lots of tequila.
6533187	6541071	So 10 emails for Mexican drink night for a fiesta in studio here at Orange Lounge Radio.
6541992	6542272	Alright.
6544893	6546354	We gotta get to the FUs of the week.
6546434	6550956	Every week on the show we get a little bit angsty and we have to share our angst with you all.
6551056	6551396	Why?
6551897	6552357	Because we can.
6568127	6584002	FU to Northrend First world problems Loki FU to Activision for putting out a game called Skylanders Spyro's Adventure Skylanders is first off a really good game
6585555	6586315	and DarkSakura.com
6616032	6618054	$8!
6616793	6618054	$8 for a toy that does nothing.
6618315	6619696	It is literally a figurine.
6619716	6621278	It is about 2 inches tall.
6621678	6622439	It does nothing.
6622619	6623360	It doesn't move.
6623700	6627224	It doesn't do anything other than activate a character in a game.
6628005	6628285	So...
6629944	6639771	Why kids would buy that or parents would buy that instead of, I don't know, a Mario game or, I don't know, any other toy out there on the market is beyond me.
6640131	6643394	And on top of all that, they want to sell this thing starting off at $70.
6645695	6652740	$70 for a Wii game, PS3 game, 360 game because it comes with some bullshit toys that aren't really toys.
6652780	6654261	What would you like to see sell more?
6654542	6656143	Tickle Me Elmo or this thing?
6656283	6656763	Anything.
6657003	6657804	Anything other than this.
6657984	6658545	And you know what?
6658865	6666732	I predict right now that this is going to be as big of a failure as Tony Hawk Shred, Tony Hawk Ride, and sadly enough, DJ Hero 2.
6666792	6669774	So meaning like a year and a half later, I'll be able to get them for $10?
6669914	6670295	Oh, yes.
6671055	6671275	Yes.
6671896	6677180	I really wish I could have gotten some of those Renegade or the bundles of all the stuff.
6677501	6678862	You know what's even better with that stuff?
6679222	6680423	Flip it on fucking eBay.
6681164	6682805	You can make more than $10 off that.
6682965	6683145	Hell...
6683886	6685529	You know what you could do with that kind of stuff?
6685890	6687773	If you got the extra turntables and stuff?
6687953	6691459	You could flip it to GameStop and make more than $10 off of that.
6691639	6693782	If you really wanted to go that route.
6694223	6696307	But I mean, that's just money in the bag right there.
6697605	6699207	But yes, it will not sell very well.
6699387	6700028	Because you know why?
6700048	6712823	Because there's a lot of kids games coming out this holiday and with Mario and stuff on the 3DS and on the console systems and everything else and Call of Duty no one's going to give a shit about Spyro.
6713204	6715587	A character that was popular 10 years ago.
6717134	6718555	Skylanders with Spyro, basically.
6747389	6747809	You done?
6748130	6748430	I'm done.
6748450	6749250	Ah, finally.
6749651	6756956	Alright, uh, my FU of the week goes to Peanut Butter Pinkberry, because, you guys, it's so good.
6757036	6761799	Like, they do one where they put strawberry jam on it and toasted breadcrumbs, and oh my god.
6762439	6763460	Oh my god, it's so good.
6763740	6769364	But here's why I give it an FU, because, well, A, it's good, and B, it's not non-fat or low-fat.
6769524	6773187	Every other flavor in Pinkberry's history has been, like, non-fat or low-fat, but this one...
6774508	6775048	Extra fat.
6775248	6775828	Extra fat.
6776209	6780171	Seven grams of fat a serving, which, you know, ice cream's worse, but still.
6780691	6781752	That's a little disappointing.
6782312	6783553	Special occasions only.
6784854	6786235	I know, this is a real problem, right?
6786715	6788096	All right, there it is, FUs of the Week.
6788396	6792378	More news stories for you guys, and then the Skype line is about five stories away.
6793939	6802841	So Ubisoft is apparently trying to pull a THQ and put out a tablet peripheral for, I guess, the Wii.
6803082	6805522	It looks like it's supposed to be for the Wii.
6806883	6810844	Right now they're kind of, it's a work in progress thing, Project InTouch.
6811704	6816085	And they have an internal marketing video that's been found leaked out there.
6816885	6823832	Basically, they have some sort of tablet that's going to be used to play games.
6824113	6826455	It's basically all the same stuff that you see right now with the U-Draw.
6829238	6829618	I don't know.
6830079	6831820	It's interesting, I guess.
6833722	6839388	I know the U-Draw is doing alright, but I don't know if there's really room on the market for multiple tablet peripherals.
6840455	6841155	Thanks for watching!
6861423	6866848	Well, it's hard to convince people to buy... More plastic shit.
6867549	6874475	...a $100 skateboard for a game that, you know, it's really going to be the only game that's going to support it, or two games.
6874495	6878959	So why is UDraw succeeded in where this one is trying to get some of that success?
6878979	6883824	Well, UDraw succeeded because they've got a lot of different games that have come out for it.
6884204	6885325	Right now, they have...
6887067	6890008	I think it's about five games right now that support it.
6890629	6892230	And there's a lot more coming out this fall.
6892330	6895612	Plus, there's going to be more UDraw stuff on other systems.
6896132	6898794	You get it on the PlayStation 3 and 360 as well this year.
6899734	6905218	And on top of that, besides the licensed stuff that THQ's done, like with SpongeBob and...
6905558	6906979	They're Marvel stuff.
6907340	6917889	They've got now licenses from other companies like Disney Princess stuff, and actually there's going to be a Mickey drawing program or something like that, a Disney animation program.
6918309	6919490	Gosh, that sounds like fun.
6919510	6920591	That would be kind of cool.
6920711	6924435	So they're getting other companies to support this kind of thing.
6924455	6929839	So Ubisoft, I'm sure if you played your cards right and talked to THQ, they would probably let you make a game for...
6930880	6932120	You know, the UDraw tablet.
6932500	6933821	Save yourself a whole bunch of time.
6933901	6935861	Instead, you're going to put out this other peripheral.
6935901	6937142	Now, why would they do that?
6937602	6938822	Why would they do that?
6939082	6944643	Why would you concede to another company to make it a lot easier for yourself when you can just make something that will fail on your own?
6944663	6946924	And you can just fucking steamroll with all your franchises.
6947504	6952665	Well, why would we bother publishing with the UDraw when we can make our own and take the market from UDraw?
6952945	6956806	It's just... I don't think there's really going to be a market for it.
6957407	6958247	But we'll see.
6958647	6958947	Whatever.
6960496	6963057	They've tried to think outside the box with different stuff.
6963317	6968399	Remember, it was last E3, they had a bunch of games that weren't really games.
6968679	6982004	They had some sort of relaxation program or something like that, where you basically... It was basically the... What was it?
6982044	6982184	The...
6985080	6988002	That stupid Wii peripheral that they had that they never put out.
6988022	6988943	I don't remember the hell it was.
6988983	6990223	The Vitality Sensor.
6990464	6992845	It was basically the Vitality Sensor, but on the PC.
6993586	6997828	And they had that come out, and they had some laser tag game come out that wasn't really a game.
6997888	6999369	It was just something that ran on the PC.
7000490	7001911	It was basically a laser tag toy.
7002652	7008535	And they had one other thing that was kind of along the lines of that.
7010357	7013679	Yeah, they're definitely trying some unique stuff over there at Ubisoft.
7017367	7020217	All right, well, we'll see if it works for him.
7020277	7020658	I don't know.
7020698	7024411	I think flooding the market with too much of the similar shit is going to end up being a bad thing, but we'll see.
7025330	7034996	Anyhow, there's been rumors going around forever that Diablo 3, you know, big PC release coming out later this year, big rumor for the longest time that it'll probably end up on consoles as well.
7035356	7049726	Well, let's just fan the flames of that fire because during a Gamescom press conference this week, Josh Moschera, who's the lead designer behind Diablo 3, said that Blizzard is, quote, very, very serious about bringing the Diablo 3 experience to the console.
7050686	7054269	The company is, quote, trying to build the best console team at Blizzard.
7054989	7069786	now they're not saying what game they're working on but you can expect it's probably Diablo or it's the new MMO that would be ironic if that was the case because Diablo 3 doesn't have to be connected to the internet the whole time to play the game but the console version you probably wouldn't have to be
7071674	7100607	um that's maybe or maybe not true uh we could that could be a sticking point for why it's not on the consoles right now I would think that whole real money trade auction house is what's holding things up especially when it comes to Xbox 360 I could not see that shit flying on the 360 without Microsoft getting a cut of that somehow although then again to have Diablo 3 on their console would be a pretty big score for them so it would have to be online only and if not um that thing would get hacked apart
7101443	7103804	Maybe they're going to keep it separate from the PC one somehow.
7104024	7104404	That's true.
7104424	7107005	They could do that without the real money auction house.
7107225	7107365	Yep.
7108045	7109245	So we will see.
7109945	7112026	But for now, that's all we know.
7112166	7114847	More rumors to fuel those fires.
7115627	7116987	So I don't care.
7117027	7119868	I'm still getting Diablo 3 just because I was such a sucker for the first one.
7119928	7120708	So whatever.
7121388	7122109	I don't think I am.
7123009	7123809	Aw, sad face.
7123849	7125149	I never got into the other Diablo games.
7126790	7126890	So.
7127987	7128308	DarkSakura.com
7145049	7145810	So who knows?
7145890	7152495	Maybe they'll be going back to Squirt, which actually makes sense because I'm going to use this as an example.
7152535	7157199	The company that I used to work for when I was doing student loans, we were Educade.
7158280	7166987	When Wachovia purchased the company, they've actually purchased First Union, which owned Educade and the money store and all that.
7167908	7175872	But we had to brand ourselves as Educate Wachovia, and then after a while we became Wachovia Student Services or whatever.
7176873	7180194	But it's the same thing, I think.
7180454	7187738	Now that they've got Square and Enix in everybody's head, they're going to rebrand back to Square.
7190049	7191090	It makes perfect sense.
7191310	7201115	Well, I also think of remember when there was G4 and then there was Tech TV and then there was G4 Tech TV and then it was like chomp and now it's just G4 again.
7201135	7202915	Yeah, it's just part of rebranding.
7203136	7203636	Yeah.
7203676	7211760	With any acquisition, especially with a big company, something that's well known, you have to merge your branding so that people will start associating one with the other.
7213141	7217863	I'm still sad to see the name Enix go away because now we'll never get another bus to move.
7219656	7221197	We might, but it won't say Enix on it.
7221577	7222138	That's true.
7223258	7223738	That's okay.
7223779	7225860	I'll just bust out my other two bust moves.
7227121	7227581	Play them.
7228241	7228541	Alright.
7229402	7230483	So we'll see what happens with that.
7231003	7235686	Couple more stories for you guys, then we're gonna get to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
7235726	7236306	But not just yet.
7236886	7237787	Loki's got a story for us.
7240787	7243969	There's some interesting stuff on the PlayStation Network front.
7243989	7250031	They're actually going to start offering some cheaper rentals for different movies and TV shows.
7251272	7257534	$0.99 movie and TV rentals are coming, and right now they've got a really small list of what's going to be available.
7258094	7265657	I guess every Tuesday, a selection of movies and TV rentals will see a discount of $0.99 for the SD versions and $1.99 for HD.
7268779	7290755	I believe this week was Sicko, The Long Shots, Salvage, Tony, Shank, Bonded by Blood, JFK, Reckless Youth Part 1 and Part 2, Deadly Blessing, Carver, Devil in the Flesh, and Illuminating Angels and Demons.
7291775	7295358	That was what was on there.
7295686	7297269	So they're going to be discounting stuff each week.
7297289	7302899	That's kind of neat, I guess, to drive a little bit more sales in that category.
7303420	7304883	Especially maybe to compete a little bit with
7306255	7328457	Redbox and yeah but the stuff they're offering is crap have you looked at what's on the list it's all a bunch of crap but hey you know what something's something cheaper is still better than nothing I still don't see how any of that stuff's really a better value than Netflix although I guess you know Netflix is kind of challenged for a lot of content and may continue to be challenged over the next year or what have you but I don't know
7328837	7337347	Like I was looking, one of my friends uses that Vudu site and I kind of saw that for the first time over the weekend and I don't know, it seemed too expensive for me.
7338528	7341752	I was like, dang, they want too much money for all these rentals of old stuff.
7341792	7346558	I don't know, I guess everything seems expensive next to Netflix where you're paying the one fee for the whole month, you know?
7348444	7348824	Yeah, I don't know.
7348924	7349364	It's just me.
7350705	7353947	All right, one other story for you guys, and this has to do with Portal 2.
7355327	7357448	Of course you love Portal 2, right, DarkSakura?
7357889	7358289	Yeah.
7358369	7360010	DarkSakura speaks for all the listeners.
7361410	7365052	Well, Portal 2, you know, we were supposed to be getting download content.
7365192	7366153	Where the hell is it?
7366473	7369134	It was supposed to be here in the summer, and it's still not here.
7369954	7370835	Burn his house down.
7372156	7376058	Apparently, it's going to be happening in September.
7376538	7379560	September is when the download content will be coming out.
7379860	7380741	And they are saying it's free.
7381201	7385783	So if you're like all huffy and puffy about the fact that the download content still is now, you know what?
7385803	7386844	Good things come to those who wait.
7388005	7390366	They have not said what the download content might include.
7391006	7398651	And all that's being said about it is that Valve's Doug Lombardi apparently said, quote, it's still technically summer.
7401109	7402530	which he does have a point, right?
7402690	7404912	Fall doesn't really start until what?
7404972	7405953	September 21st?
7406533	7410116	So technically it is still summer in early September.
7410216	7411257	So fine.
7411277	7412958	That's the dorkiest thing I've ever heard.
7412978	7414659	You win on this technicality.
7414760	7422986	You better have it out or we're sending more protesters out to protest in front of Valve because that's the thing people do these days.
7424867	7425228	All right.
7427062	7427602	Twitter.com slash OLR
7456860	7463046	It's the show where every gamer has a voice and we welcome that through the phones or through our Twitter.
7463907	7469813	Or, of course, there's always the chat room if you're like, you know, I don't have a Twitter or I'm too lazy to call or what have you.
7470213	7472415	Our Twitter brings all the calls to the yard.
7472435	7473096	You can always do it that way.
7474778	7478041	And it's like, damn right, my call quality is better than yours.
7478602	7478862	What?
7479663	7480023	I don't know.
7482196	7495446	Alright, let's see, trying to go to some of the tweets here from earlier in the week We got wished a happy third to a birthday Nice, by who?
7498871	7500353	Twee Birthday or some account.
7500393	7500673	I don't know.
7500693	7501894	It's probably a spam account.
7501914	7502254	Who knows?
7502875	7503195	All right.
7503255	7503875	Let's go to the phone.
7503895	7504976	You've been on Twitter a while.
7505797	7506357	Have a dollar.
7506477	7507498	Hey, you're on Orange House Radio.
7507518	7507859	Who's this?
7508359	7509160	It's Death Wishing.
7509180	7509540	Oh, my God.
7509580	7510341	I can see you.
7511562	7512182	Yeah, you can.
7513203	7514464	Thank God you have a shirt on.
7514504	7514864	What's up?
7515725	7516966	I'm playing EVE Online.
7517907	7518327	What's EVE?
7518447	7518707	Okay.
7519148	7520609	I've never played EVE Online before.
7521049	7521970	What's EVE Online like?
7522694	7528476	Space Cowboy with tons of space rocks and mining and just people being assholes.
7531436	7533137	I mean, I can give you an example.
7533417	7539119	It's a lot harder than World of Warcraft and it's a lot better in my opinion because you can pretty much do whatever you want.
7539139	7540599	You don't have to follow your class guideline.
7542575	7543355	The customization.
7543395	7552920	They recently also just released an expansion where you can walk around in stations, which is also going to build into the game Dust 5.14, if you also heard of that, which I kind of want to talk about.
7552940	7553940	Okay.
7553980	7554380	Yeah, yeah.
7554780	7558482	Let's talk about that a little bit, because I did hear about that at E3, and it sounded really exciting.
7558762	7559782	What's this all about?
7560283	7564524	Well, think of, you know, the game Planetside, and did you ever play it?
7565845	7565945	No.
7566886	7567006	No.
7568857	7578782	Dust is a first-person shooter that is going to be pretty much just like Planetside, but for the PS3.
7579003	7593150	Only the PS3, which is weird, but it's going to tie in to EVE Online, where basically it will work as in the player-run corporations that are on EVE Online will be able to hire mercenaries from the PlayStation 3 to fight over planets in the EVE universe.
7593810	7597632	Which, basically, they will fight over minerals, blah blah blah, whatever the hell is on the planet.
7597652	7599373	It could be a pile of shit, I don't know.
7600514	7605156	And, basically, corporations will buy us, the PlayStation 3 users...
7606744	7608565	All their weaponry, all their tanks and stuff.
7608585	7617008	So basically, if the PC users supply their mercenary corporation, they earn pretty much unlimited wealth.
7617408	7618588	And that's what Dust is.
7619528	7621409	And EVE Online is really hard to explain.
7621449	7623670	All I can say is it's hard.
7625037	7629459	What makes it so rewarding to be playing the game?
7631781	7633622	Everything in this game is basically player-run.
7633682	7642886	They have player-run banks that people make real spreadsheets and stuff where you put your in-game money, and it works exactly like a real bank, building interest, taking out loans and stuff like that.
7643567	7646608	But then, as you would think, there's also people that scam that system.
7646708	7649430	I think a couple months ago, there was a guy who made a bank
7650509	7658953	made it for two years, got about $870 billion ISK, transferred all that money to another account, closed his account down, and all of the users were complaining that they lost money, right?
7659494	7659654	Right.
7659694	7665177	The freaking corporation just told them, or the CCP, who runs the game, said, welcome to the game.
7665357	7666097	Don't trust people.
7670259	7671780	And it doesn't hold your hand like World of Warcraft.
7671800	7672340	Did I say that?
7672741	7674502	Yeah, you did mention that a little bit, I think.
7675342	7676803	Yeah, it's hard to explain, but...
7679062	7679382	I don't know.
7679442	7681464	Also, I want to say that I hate Activision.
7682364	7683385	Why do you hate Activision?
7683405	7686147	Because the guy who runs the company is such an asshole.
7686287	7686947	Bobby Kotick?
7687388	7689369	Yeah, he ruins game series.
7689409	7690550	He's ruined Tony Hawk.
7690570	7691611	He ruined Call of Duty.
7691871	7693632	What fuckery is he responsible for this week?
7693652	7695173	What fuckery set you off this week?
7696194	7697214	Besides jobs.
7699656	7700136	Activision.
7701687	7703647	I think there's a bit of personal bitterness here to this.
7703727	7705368	I'm just an angry person.
7705788	7706828	An angry college kid.
7706888	7709588	You're just an angry listener.
7709628	7710389	An angry gamer.
7711609	7711849	Yes.
7713469	7716050	I usually have more to talk about, but I'm actually a boring person this week.
7716090	7718330	I'm kind of on a recovery day.
7718470	7721231	Sorry, let me read this tweet for a recovery day.
7721791	7724131	Was Burning Man this week or something?
7725992	7726672	Don't worry about it.
7726732	7727852	What were you going to say?
7728012	7728472	Alright, fine.
7729063	7736147	Tiger Claw says EVE Online is by far the most hardcore hardest core game in its existence agree?
7736688	7757480	I totally agree especially since my corporation got attacked like last week and we lost like 500 million so yikes which um yeah I can also say one thing a lot of the money in the game amounts to real money so like there's ships that cost they're called Titan Claw ships $10,000 real currency they're just throwing that out there $10,000 in real currency yeah
7758669	7761650	Real currency.
7761670	7767991	Because $360 million is $15 a currency, which you can use the currency that you make in-game to buy your in-game subscription.
7768111	7768731	Right, right.
7768851	7769351	I've heard of that.
7769371	7772111	You can buy these cards or something that you use, right?
7772971	7779773	Like, wasn't there a big story where they blew up a big carrier that was carrying a bunch of those cards and, like, all this game time was just lost?
7779933	7781173	Yeah, I forgot what it was.
7781233	7783913	I think it was some player who was really retarded.
7784033	7787614	I believe you can put that stuff in your, like, a hanger and...
7788254	7790855	He was retarded and kept it around and went with him for God knows why.
7790915	7794316	So people heard about it, killed him, took game time.
7794976	7795436	Your fault.
7795896	7796196	Yikes.
7797156	7797436	All right.
7797476	7799117	Well, Death Wishing, we're going to let you go.
7799417	7800437	But thanks for the call.
7801077	7802578	And thanks for the webcam.
7802858	7804738	It's interesting to see our listeners there.
7804818	7807179	So we're not hooking one up so you can see us, though.
7807239	7807499	All right.
7807919	7808479	I'm not fat.
7808739	7809459	Don't worry about it.
7809759	7810600	All right.
7810640	7811120	Take care.
7811200	7811420	All right.
7811560	7811880	All right.
7811920	7812160	Later.
7812180	7812960	Mine rock time.
7813020	7813280	Bye.
7816829	7845514	I want to see more well maybe that's something I don't want to wish maybe I don't want to see more of the listeners but yeah sure why not call us with your webcams it'll be fun we want to see the sexy ones alright now the 877 number is apparently broken but there is a back door you can use 916-226-9067 I want to point out that is not a toll free number so if you don't have like a cell phone that has free nationwide long distance that number will not work it looks like someone's using that number right now hi you're on Orange Lawns Radio who's this
7846838	7874328	it's Shane Miklatov whatever hey what's up Miklatov again I want to clarify 877 I don't know it's like I'm having problems with the phone constantly last week and now this week 877 number will not work something's up with the toll-free forwarder you can use the back door a 916-226-9067 please only use that if you have free long distance which a lot of cell phone companies do but be very very careful all right Miklatov what's on your mind
7876074	7877175	Um, nothing.
7879115	7880316	So you're just calling to say hey?
7881996	7891000	No, I meant to call in last week, but I have a little anecdote that leads into a kind of stance I'm taking, I think.
7891300	7892120	Alright, let's hear it.
7893121	7897563	Okay, so last week I was at work and we were doing a blood drive.
7899263	7903845	So I go get blood, even though technically, legally, I'm not allowed to because laws are stupid.
7904654	7911097	So I'm sitting there giving blood, being all bored, and I bust out my phone and start playing some games on my phone.
7911537	7912557	And I'm having a really good time.
7912577	7914318	It makes the time pass super quick.
7914878	7916419	And then I'm starting to think about this.
7916519	7920780	I play games on my phone when I'm giving blood.
7921180	7926302	I play games on my phone when I'm waiting at the drive-thru to pick up food or order or whatever.
7927063	7930164	I play games at work when I am in the back
7931143	7934425	looking for stuff or quote-unquote looking for stuff to put out.
7935285	7942928	And it hits me that I feel like the mobile phone games now are really what's portable gaming.
7943649	7944849	That's like the definition.
7945229	7951412	And things like the Vita, the PSP, the DS, too big, too bulky to really be portable systems.
7951472	7957795	And I really begin to realize that I only use those portably if I'm on a plane.
7958740	7961682	Otherwise, I'm playing my portable systems at home.
7962422	7970527	And I think that Nintendo and Sony are going to find themselves in this same sort of mindset after a few years.
7970607	7973649	Because, you know, those things are just too big and bulky.
7973729	7979072	And the iPhone and the Android phone, their games are just way more accessible for
7979795	7981656	Your portable gaming nowadays
8008271	8011053	Well, okay, you all saw how well that worked out, right?
8011393	8013494	So that's why Nintendo... It was a CDI.
8013514	8014495	I'm sorry, CDI.
8015015	8015356	My bad.
8015396	8017577	It was one of those 90s CD-based systems.
8017917	8018978	So, okay, fine, the CDI.
8019498	8020999	Clearly, that didn't work out well for them.
8021039	8022320	They got fucking burned on that.
8022340	8023921	I don't think they created it.
8023961	8025862	They just licensed the character out for it.
8025882	8030886	Well, still, though, it just goes to show you how they're very protective of their shit, and they don't want to do that.
8030926	8034408	But, you know, Nintendo's already kind of tested the waters with that, though.
8034428	8036029	In Japan, they have that Pokemon...
8036536	8039217	Trading Card Rhythm Game on the iPhone.
8039257	8042918	The Pokemon company has tested, but that's not Nintendo themselves.
8042958	8044879	Yeah, but that's Nintendo's brand.
8044939	8051842	I mean, Pokemon is, I mean, yeah, it's Pokemon company, but you're not going to see Pokemon go over to Vita or Xbox.
8053402	8057886	So you do bring up an interesting point, though, is that the only place a lot of people tend to play their portable gaming systems is at home.
8058206	8060248	And that's kind of where I do a lot of my portable gaming, too.
8060328	8069215	Like, I have my 3DS kind of by my bed, and maybe, like, when it's, you know, bedtime, quote-unquote, and I go into bed, and maybe I'll stay up for about 20 minutes and play the 3DS, you know?
8069595	8071577	That's where I tend to do most of my portable gaming.
8072558	8076741	Well, and you know, at E3 this year, I had my PSP, which stayed in my hotel room.
8077402	8081365	I had my 3DS, which I used to get StreetPass Tags.
8081710	8092677	and then play their little mini dungeon game because I did not have time, even when standing in line, or not time, but I was not really comfortable holding that thing in my hand playing some game that's in-depth.
8092958	8097261	Had I had something like Tiny Tower, I would have been all over my phone at that point.
8097381	8099262	And I probably would have needed to...
8099827	8102709	Bring a charger or something with me
8121363	8122264	What did you do the street pass for?
8122304	8124325	Did you do it to do that stupid fill in the puzzles?
8124345	8126727	Or did you do it to do the stupid like
8143150	8145793	You can do both when you street pass.
8147254	8151798	When you meet a character and they go hello, it gives you their little URL.
8151898	8156763	I was also street passing for Street Fighter 4 data and now I'll be street passing for Ridge Racer 3DS data.
8156783	8158124	I want more ghosts to race against.
8159424	8186741	I think there's a lot of really interesting things they can do with StreetPass I just don't think any of the games out right now really sell that stuff very well but I'm interested to see what future games can kind of think up with the StreetPassing that's very interesting to me but I'm not to say I'm totally disagreeing with you because I think part of the reason the 3DS isn't selling does have to do with the fact that mobile phones are doing it in some ways better definitely cheaper
8188222	8194507	and I think the price of portable games needs to come down to stay competitive with iOS games.
8194927	8200971	I think charging $40 for a 3DS game isn't going to fly and I think they're going to be in for a rude awakening pretty soon.
8201011	8204673	If they can't get that price down to $20, kiss it goodbye.
8206494	8207695	Yeah.
8207955	8209997	I look at my portable games I'm playing right now.
8210357	8214940	I pick up Zelda since it's launched maybe once every week and a half.
8215450	8223192	and then I bust out my phone to play Groove Coaster or Tiny Tower or Juke Beat which I actually like a lot.
8223392	8223512	Ew.
8224353	8225493	Juke Beat's terrible.
8226613	8227094	Oh, I love it.
8227194	8228494	I'm sorry.
8228534	8232895	Did you download any of the download content stuff for Juke Beat?
8233716	8235036	No, because they're all terrible sounding.
8235056	8235116	See?
8235156	8235316	See?
8235396	8235456	See?
8239966	8241168	But that's just to start.
8241208	8243292	The three that they have you begin with are awesome.
8243712	8246397	I love that Contra song, and even the Frogger song's pretty good.
8246457	8247158	I'll give you that.
8247198	8249322	The Contra and Frogger songs are kind of cool.
8249482	8250023	Kind of.
8250484	8253489	And it is really too hard, but it's still...
8265521	8267842	I'm playing Tiny Tower right now while you're trying to talk.
8268022	8270524	I'm half paying attention to you, I'm half restocking all my stores.
8271244	8273726	Because now Bobby had to go and make it a contest.
8274546	8274766	What?
8274786	8278208	I said I was doing that and then I called in.
8278949	8280790	And then you go right back to it.
8281789	8284454	Yeah, that and wow, I'm just like, oh, I'm flying somewhere.
8284474	8291247	Well, I gotta check on my supplies, make sure everything's stocked up, and I just upgraded my elevator, so it's going faster, and I love it.
8291808	8293431	Like, it changed the game completely for me.
8294594	8295154	Oh, I still am.
8296595	8296935	I love that.
8296955	8303617	Yeah, because I don't foresee me going outside and busting out my Vita and playing Uncharted because that is not a game...
8324284	8325965	Honestly, that you want portable.
8326045	8334068	I want to sit down and experience this awesome game with best headphones and all sorts of being comfortable.
8334108	8337810	I want to stand on a bus or in a subway playing Uncharted.
8339330	8340271	One more comment from chat.
8340291	8341671	I got to let you guys get some more calls.
8341691	8344592	But Kaijudo in the chatroom says, phones are not killing the 3DS.
8344672	8346973	It's the lack of anything on the 3DS that's killing it.
8347033	8348113	And I kind of tend to agree.
8348193	8349774	That's really the 3DS' biggest problem.
8349794	8353295	But I also think the price of the games is really an issue.
8353415	8355956	I mean, I think it's more of an issue than Nintendo wants to admit.
8356316	8361738	I realize games are expensive to make, but there has to come a point where you go, we're not selling these games at $40.
8362478	8364459	We have to cut the price to get these to sell.
8364999	8367340	And maybe we'll sell three times as much.
8367560	8367900	Sorry, go on.
8368393	8368753	No, go ahead.
8369354	8386842	I really hope that this price cut and then realizing how bad the system is doing forces them to make an actual, real, honest-to-goodness 3D Pokemon game that's not some spin-off like the new one in Japan, because, I mean, that would get me to buy four more systems, even though I have one.
8386902	8389864	And I plan on getting that red one, too, just to have a red one.
8389924	8391084	Just to have a flamey red one?
8392185	8398108	Yeah, I had a red and a blue SP when they came out, so I can do a red and a blue 3DS, I decided.
8398128	8398188	Wow.
8405286	8405766	Alright.
8406727	8409028	Well, I'm going to let you go so we can get some more calls, alright?
8410068	8410809	Alright, sounds good.
8410849	8411389	Thanks for the call.
8412470	8412950	No problem.
8413030	8413270	Later.
8415450	8440038	Alright, give us a call at area code 916-226-9067 Again, not toll free, the toll free number is down right now Or call us on Skype, that's always free Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype I'll get to the Twitter topics in just a moment here Let's see, I'm trying to get through some of these here Trying to get through the feedback for last week's show and so forth What is this?
8440418	8442479	I'm trying to see if this is a story we've already covered
8444973	8449336	No, this is something that EricRPG tweeted us, and this is about Nintendo 3DS.
8449396	8452898	Could a new Fire Emblem game be on its way to the Nintendo 3DS?
8453758	8460963	Apparently, an online gaming site called The Magic Box posted that a new Fire Emblem game will be announced by Nintendo fairly soon.
8461323	8465205	Apparently, it's called Fire Emblem Blue Sacred Sword and Red Demon Lance.
8465225	8472610	It's supposed to be 100 years after Sealed Sword, and the story will center around the Princess of Kingdom Burn and the Prince of Kingdom Lycia.
8473190	8475473	and each will have a different story in their perspective.
8475513	8480458	There will also be a new casual mode for beginners and lunatic mode for advanced players.
8480878	8485663	No word on where this information is coming from, but sounds good enough to me.
8486063	8486424	I don't know.
8486604	8489587	Fire Emblem on 3DS seems like a logical next step, don't you think?
8489987	8491328	Sounds like an educated guess to me.
8491348	8492670	Alright.
8494979	8501124	Spazernator PSN tweets us saying, OLR, could you please say hi to your newest listener, Shirley, in Arizona, please?
8501825	8502205	Shirley!
8502726	8503406	Shirley, we will.
8503947	8504147	Hi.
8504167	8504908	You just did, right?
8505568	8505788	Yeah.
8505908	8510512	Alright, and I'm sure that's a pun that Shirley is terribly sick of hearing.
8510893	8512374	Alright, let's go to the phones and get more calls.
8512414	8513315	Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.
8513335	8514095	Who's this?
8514115	8515016	Sludgeon Zaku here.
8515096	8516197	Hey, Zaku, what's on your mind?
8517438	8521902	Nothing much, just trying to recover from Ramna's barbecue we held at his place yesterday.
8523840	8524660	What's this all about?
8524700	8525780	What was happening at the barbecue?
8526821	8532042	Bacon-wrapped sausage, a lot of food, a lot of, like, raunchy card games.
8532062	8537383	We were just, like, drawing and using Sharpies against other people while they were passed out.
8539283	8540083	Like Jigglypuff.
8541084	8542624	It was exactly like that.
8543164	8544664	Oh, God, I can't believe it.
8545244	8547065	We'll probably fill you in on the details.
8547285	8547865	Anyways...
8549318	8553205	So, they were mentioning Activision being the new devil.
8553686	8558474	I don't think they're the new devil.
8558534	8560798	They've been the devil for at least a good year.
8561755	8574083	Well, I mean, I know that's still debatable, but I mean, they're like, I don't know, it's like EA is starting to go back into the dark side, but then again, they've been doing pretty well ever since going away from it.
8574523	8583549	It doesn't matter, staying in that point where you're making money, but you don't piss off the fanbase like Activision does by just shoveling out crap.
8584502	8597816	Like, I mean, you know, the way I see it right now is that Activision's trying to make amends by doing dedicated servers for Modern Warfare 3, but God knows what restrictions they will have.
8597876	8606205	Like, we don't know whether they're just going to be, like, rent-a-servers, or there's better, or it's like a full no-strings-attached ones, like, you know, like in Call of Duty 4.
8608004	8615811	So it's like, when Activision tries to throw out something like that, I don't even think it's them being genuine about it.
8615831	8623197	It's just them trying to capitalize, trying to sweep, trying to bury all their transgressions that they did in the past.
8623217	8627461	They're just trying to bury it, trying to kiss and make up.
8628822	8631344	And that right there is just not really sincere.
8631844	8632705	Well, it's a company.
8632725	8633566	Of course they're not sincere.
8634474	8648332	I don't understand, but when they treated but if you remember how that whole Modern Warfare 2 on PC that whole thing went out that whole thing panned out where they got rid of the dedicated servers and you see a bunch of folks just like
8649517	8653861	They basically said, to hell with Activision, it's not worth it.
8654382	8655122	I was one of them.
8656063	8663831	I was really hyped up for Modern Warfare 2 that year until that news broke, and I just lost interest, and I got back company 2 instead.
8664211	8672439	You're talking about all those people that decided, hey, we're going to basically form a group that's going to boycott Modern Warfare 2, and then they were all playing Modern Warfare 2.
8672479	8673660	I just stuck to my guns.
8674982	8698998	if you look at my Steam profile I don't have that game I have Call of Duty 4 I mean the last good one with dedicated servers it's like I basically have not I've never played Modern Warfare 2 not even in consoles SSJ100 Matt is in the chat room hold on because I have to get this out here because this is kind of funny is saying correction Bobby Kotick is the new devil Activision would be fine without him there you agree?
8699758	8702801	Well, yeah, I guess that's what I was trying to refer to.
8702861	8706884	I mean, he is personifying the evil intentions of the devil.
8707585	8708966	Well, him and his company.
8710677	8726860	But yeah, I mean, it's like, after seeing the 64-player multiplayer video for Battlefield 3 this week, I mean, like last week during Gamescom, it's like, I don't have any incentive to buy Modern Warfare 3 anymore.
8726900	8739002	It's like, sure, they may throw in dedicated servers, but you're going to get your money's worth in terms of production values and gameplay out of Battlefield 3, just by the looks of it.
8739822	8742183	Are you going for a console version or PC version?
8742523	8742823	Both.
8743023	8745204	I mean... What do you think of the origin stuff?
8745504	8753826	Granted, the console's like, what, 24 players and obviously the PC's more, but it's still pretty good from both spectrums.
8753846	8755106	What do you think of the origin?
8755126	8758447	All that Modern Warfare 3 is just doing is rehashing perks.
8759027	8759347	That's it.
8759367	8759988	That's all it is.
8761868	8768310	The whole basis is the more kills you get, the more balance you tip against the others.
8769470	8774475	Like, you know, UAV, just spamming UAV airstrikes and so forth.
8775216	8777819	What about the fact that on PC you're forced to use Origin?
8779640	8780061	I don't know.
8780101	8782123	I mean, I'm kind of indifferent about it.
8782744	8789951	I know I was holding out for them having to sell it on Steam, but at this point, I may give it a shot.
8790611	8792393	Because at the end of the day...
8793504	8816962	it's it's like the same it's like what what Valve went through when they first released Half-Life 2 like when they first launched Steam they were basically they were completely dead set against it they just hated it they just hated its guts from the get-go and now it's pretty much one of the top digital districts the top digital distributors it's the thing to have on PC right now it's kind of the cool kids club
8817774	8826037	I understand, but as I said, it's like, or EA's going to go through their own steam moment when launching.
8827138	8836362	So it's like, if EA can basically pass that test in terms of providing a decent alternative to steam, then more power to them.
8837962	8844625	As long as they bring it on par with it, then it'll be an easier pill to swallow.
8844985	8846486	It won't be like eating a shit sandwich.
8847222	8855044	Alright, I gotta let you go so we can get more calls, but I gotta say this, I wanna know when the next barbecue is happening, because I may need to come back out to New York for that, and I'm gonna draw all of your faces.
8855064	8855724	Try next summer.
8856404	8857084	Next summer?
8857645	8862066	Yes, Adam, Ranma is only gonna hold, only holds them like once a year.
8862766	8866427	Maybe Labor Day, but I don't think Ranma, I demand one in my honor.
8867447	8869307	Ranma will throw one in my honor if I come visit.
8870268	8871328	Yeah, I'm pretty sure he will.
8871548	8872268	Alright, awesome.
8873188	8873788	I get what I want.
8874068	8875989	Alright, take care, Zaku, thanks for the call.
8878287	8904998	I love the New York contingent we have a lot of fans in New York I don't know how it happened well I guess there's a lot of people in New York so it makes sense but still we have quite a few listeners there so I would I need to go back and say hello it's been far too long I need to go New York is so much fun oh my god you need to go see Mistress Tia because I love that bitch if people will send me a ticket I'll go I'm not even playing that's not how it works
8905738	8906619	Yeah, Jamie's broke.
8907619	8907939	Alright.
8909700	8911501	Hold out for another one of those JetBlue sales, man.
8911521	8913442	They go cheap sometimes.
8913802	8917484	Well, we got enough listeners out there that they could send us tickets.
8917584	8918664	I don't see why they don't.
8919184	8920565	Yeah, but then you owe them something.
8921588	8922489	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8949345	8949766	Iowa?
8950206	8950547	I don't know.
8951468	8951828	Let's see.
8953210	8958375	It's a lengthy article from Gamasutra, and I didn't read this in advance, so gosh, I don't even know where to start here.
8958416	8959417	We are still seeing calls, by the way.
8959477	8960498	Orange Launch Radio on Skype.
8961359	8962420	Oh, it's ringing right now.
8962700	8964122	Good, that'll give me time to skim this article.
8965123	8965984	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
8966004	8966344	Who's this?
8966865	8968186	This is Brad from PodCulture.
8968226	8969448	Hey, Brad from PodCulture.
8969468	8970089	What's on your mind, buddy?
8970997	8972098	Oh, not a whole lot.
8972898	8976639	Finally joined the contingent and picked up a 3D last week.
8977340	8977520	3DS.
8978500	8980001	Was this after the price drop, I'm assuming?
8980541	8980741	Yeah.
8981241	8981982	Ah, and how was it?
8983122	8985183	You know, it's actually a pretty neat little system.
8986584	8987524	I'm actually digging it.
8988324	8990265	Not much in the way of games out yet, though.
8990885	8991826	No, there's not.
8991906	8994387	Is there something you're looking forward to that's coming out?
8995562	8996342	Uh, no?
8996603	8998743	No, I'm pretty satisfied with the two that I've got right now.
8998763	8999484	What do you have right now?
8999884	9003005	DOA Dimensions and, uh, Ridge Racer 3D.
9004025	9004305	Nice.
9004926	9008347	A lot of 3D boobies and DOA, I'm sure.
9009252	9011174	Well, I've always liked the DOA franchise.
9011814	9013096	Hmm, a lot of guys do.
9014497	9015198	Let me ask you this.
9015798	9020202	What kind of made you decide to take the plunge and buy the three?
9020222	9032173	The fact that the Evil G had the, if you're one of the Power Rewards members or whatever the hell membership thing that they got, if you trade in a DS Lite, you can pick it up for 99 bucks.
9033946	9045871	Oh, okay, so you did the whole, like, the Evil G. I like that, by the way, the Evil G. I had a... True story, this is not going to make sense to anyone, but I just have to say this, because, you know, some teachers that you have in your past stay with you forever.
9046191	9054975	And I had an awesome, awesome music teacher in junior high school, and his name was Mr. Gonzalez, but everybody called him Mr. G. Like, that was the name he went by for short.
9055535	9058297	And he's a great... Oh, man, I wish I knew what he was up to these days.
9058337	9059197	I wonder if he's still teaching.
9059517	9060838	But anyhow, when you say Evil G...
9062018	9065862	For whatever reason, that just triggers a response in my mind where I see his evil twin.
9068304	9069305	You know what I mean?
9069565	9079394	But I like that as a name for GameStop, Evil G. So you bought into the Evil G's trade-in scheme, which is I can't fault you for a good deal, so it's fine.
9079734	9081356	And that's what made you finally take the plunge.
9082437	9083338	Oh, yeah, definitely.
9084078	9086140	I had thought about picking one up when they came out, but ooh, $250.
9086180	9086300	Mm-hmm.
9088872	9090073	That's a little much.
9090613	9092034	Wouldn't you pick up one for about $100?
9092074	9093435	Oh yeah.
9094435	9096456	And considering that's what I paid for my DS Lite?
9097177	9097437	Yeah.
9097788	9105111	So what did you think about, we had a call a little bit ago that was talking about, I don't really use my portable game systems portably.
9106291	9112093	Do you find that your gaming habits are similar, or do you think that you might actually get more use out of this on the go?
9113314	9117315	I'm interested in taking it to DragonCon and see what I can do with the street pass function.
9117475	9118996	You'll get a shit ton there, I'm sure.
9119656	9121797	I can't even imagine a pass.
9121817	9123598	But other than that, my ass is sitting on the couch.
9123958	9124138	Mm-hmm.
9125999	9129642	I see, so you're couch surfing and playing the 3DS.
9129662	9130062	That's fine.
9130082	9131684	That's a lot of folks.
9132845	9135407	No, Bobby, I didn't steal your name for GameStop.
9135427	9138029	What do you think I heard?
9138369	9140831	Bobby's throwing a tantrum in chat right now, Brad.
9140851	9142192	You need to go address this.
9145735	9151399	He's just mad because his tiny bitizens are revolting because they don't want his tower to get bigger than mine.
9151639	9152640	Yeah, they stink on ice.
9155528	9158731	So Brad, there's some new games coming out for the 3DS this holiday.
9159351	9163074	There's the new Mario game, the new Mario Kart game.
9163134	9164194	Any of this stuff look interesting?
9164935	9168277	Well, I like Mario Kart, so that's definitely worth a look.
9169538	9170639	May pick that up.
9171994	9194909	Absolutely, I think it is going to be worth picking up So, well, I hope you have a lot of fun at DragonCon And I hope you are able to street pass with tons and tons of people And I hope you win lots of awards that I hear you're nominated for That apparently Bobby was not Hence some of the tantrum that's going on in there No, he was nominated, I don't just We weren't nominated either You were nominated Were we?
9195765	9199867	You didn't make it as a finalist, I don't think.
9200067	9200308	Oh, well.
9201008	9202009	Pretty sure you were nominated.
9202469	9202749	I don't know.
9202789	9204670	I didn't see any emails on it this year, but oh, well.
9204910	9205330	It's all good.
9206451	9206871	I ain't mad.
9209133	9215236	But yeah, if you can get in on the deal for the 3DS, go ahead and check it out.
9215716	9216357	It's a lot of fun.
9217297	9217637	All right.
9218258	9218718	Sounds good.
9218758	9220759	Another raving endorsement for the 3DS.
9221079	9221279	All right.
9221299	9223200	Well, Brad, buddy, we're going to let you go so we can wrap things up.
9223320	9223981	Thanks so much for the call.
9224542	9224822	All righty.
9224962	9225403	Later, guys.
9252079	9252419	Let's see.
9252559	9255801	Apparently these guys want to set up some type of collectible museum.
9255841	9257842	It's the guys that are behind the Classic Gaming Expo.
9257862	9262885	This is all a tweet to a story on a Gamasutra that TigerClaw sent us via Twitter.
9263745	9267027	Apparently they're the folks behind Classic Gaming Expo.
9267307	9275111	They've got a collection of 30,000 items that they want to put into a permanent official home where folks can research, document, and so forth.
9275411	9278853	But they need $30,000 to set up the base in Silicon Valley and
9279253	9300103	and they got less than two weeks to go to do it and they don't even have half of the money that they need to do it so it's not looking too good and I guess a lot of the backers just don't have an idea where the money is going and you know I guess what they're going to get out of it so to speak so some of the collection shows off at trade shows and all that stuff so they want to do it but um
9301284	9302585	It sounds like they may not hit it.
9303386	9303927	That's too bad.
9303967	9306189	It would be nice to have a video game museum of sorts.
9306310	9312677	And Silicon Valley definitely is a much more logical place to put it than whatever the fuck Iowa.
9313998	9314239	But...
9316220	9320801	Yeah, I can see where they're having problems selling an idea like that.
9320821	9329043	What they might want to do is maybe try to have it as an expansion to some type of museum that already exists that speaks to nerds' interests.
9329164	9337146	One really cool place I went to last year was the Sci-Fi Museum in Seattle, which is attached to the Experience Music Project, which is a neat little museum.
9337646	9342527	Maybe there's a place in that whole thing that they could fit a video game tribute into.
9343107	9344148	That might be the way to do it.
9344208	9347009	I know San Jose has a technology museum that's pretty awesome.
9347090	9347990	Maybe just come to my house.
9350672	9351692	Maybe that's the way to do it.
9352313	9352613	All right.
9354114	9354594	There you go.
9354674	9356575	That's going to do it for another show.
9356795	9358136	But first, I need to make sure.
9358176	9358856	Last minute stories?
9359237	9359477	Yes?
9359577	9359737	No?
9359897	9360317	Maybe so?
9361678	9363319	I'm just dropping grenades on ants.
9363459	9365560	Oh, so you're too busy fighting insects to do last minute stories.
9365580	9365901	That's fine.
9366201	9366501	It's cool.
9366892	9368153	Well, we have some Last Minute Stories.
9368233	9369434	I can talk about them if you want.
9369714	9371195	Yes, please, let's.
9372256	9373037	Well, let's see.
9373297	9379421	There's a couple of music games coming out this fall, and we can talk a little bit about what tracks will be featured in said games.
9380642	9382964	Starting with, of course, Dance Central 2.
9383024	9386707	They announced an initial song list, including some of the songs.
9386727	9389889	Was it Sexy Chick by David Guetta and Akon?
9390890	9393252	Daddy Yankee featuring Fergie with Impacto.
9393812	9395253	Darude with Sandstorm.
9395513	9396194	That's pretty funny.
9396894	9410145	Death Punk with Technologic, Bruno Mars with Grenade, Ozone with Dragoste Dente.
9410305	9411586	That's the Numa Numa song.
9412067	9412407	Yes.
9412487	9413348	You know?
9413608	9414889	Remember the guy sitting in his chair?
9414909	9416530	Ayahi, my yaku...
9422665	9445272	Donna Summers with Hot Stuff, Gnarls Barkley with Run, Lena with Satellite, Enrique Inglis with I Like It, Lady Gaga with Born This Way, Exile with I Wish For You, and Florida with David Guetta, Club Can't Handle Me.
9446647	9447447	Just Dance 3 Just Dance 3
9472999	9479823	2 Unlimited with No Limit, AHA with Take On Me, BananaRama with Venus.
9480963	9481964	I have some new stuff in there, though.
9481984	9483865	I see LMFAO and the Party Rock Anthem.
9483905	9485326	That's like a big song right now.
9485386	9486206	That is pretty cool.
9486827	9489988	A cover of Boogie Wonderland, looks like.
9490629	9492550	Katy Perry with California Girls.
9492690	9493770	Alan will be so happy to hear that.
9493810	9494631	He loves Katy Perry.
9499093	9499693	I like Mika.
9499713	9500554	I see Mika's in there.
9500899	9503200	That's a pretty round set list.
9503380	9504980	They're saying that may not be the whole thing?
9505480	9506460	I don't know if that's the whole thing.
9507421	9510921	Is that for the Wii and the PS3 and 360?
9511201	9512562	So it is going to be on all of them this time?
9512982	9513222	Yes.
9513702	9513922	Nice.
9514522	9518463	So, yeah, it's interesting.
9519383	9522064	And they even have Crazy Little Thing Called Love by Queen.
9523844	9524605	Queen songs are good.
9525505	9527425	Or Scissor Sisters, I Don't Feel Like Dancing.
9527525	9528305	That's a fun song.
9528826	9530466	That song for some reason makes me think of the Muppets.
9532679	9534941	Must be that one performance they did at the Brit Awards, I don't know.
9535841	9536122	Alright.
9536622	9538063	So that'll be a good one, I guess.
9538123	9542946	I guess the music's very important to a dancing... I've never played Just Dance, but people seem to really like it.
9543407	9551132	It's very similar, kind of, a little bit like Dance Masters, but less... It gives you a little bit of an idea of what you're supposed to do.
9551673	9557237	Like, they have kind of... It's still kind of following on screen, but there's not that many cues to it.
9557757	9558057	Okay.
9558518	9564543	But it's a lot more than Dance Masters where Dance Masters doesn't give you any cues whatsoever.
9564703	9566885	Well, it's going to be fun to watch these two games have a showdown.
9567866	9568006	Yeah.
9568286	9569427	No Dance Masters this year.
9569928	9570228	Too bad.
9570568	9571229	What a shock.
9571709	9571929	I know.
9574572	9574672	Um...
9576018	9578060	Connectimals is coming to Windows 7 phone this fall.
9579242	9579883	That's kind of weird.
9581524	9582526	SSX looks awesome.
9583006	9588252	They were showing off some of the events that they can feature including 100,000 player events.
9589614	9590735	So that's going to be really cool.
9591336	9594239	And yeah, that's it.
9595783	9596163	All right.
9596684	9604070	Well, that's going to start to close the book on another week here at Orange Lounge Radio, but we can't call it a show until we go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
9604130	9605932	So, DarkSakura, your final thought for us tonight?
9607013	9607673	I have good friends.
9609775	9611657	My final thought is Jamie has good friends.
9612898	9614059	Loki, your final thought tonight?
9614079	9617422	My final thought is I got to cut back on expenses a lot.
