00:00.000 --> 00:20.720
Tonight, August 21st, 2011, the PlayStation 3 price is cut, the Vita promises to deliver

00:20.720 --> 00:26.560
many popular social apps, and are Japanese retailers losing interest in the Xbox 360?

00:26.560 --> 00:35.260
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

00:35.260 --> 00:41.320
where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio. We are live on this Sunday, August

00:41.320 --> 00:45.840
21st of 2011. My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you over the next few hours

00:45.840 --> 00:50.260
to talk about video games, gamer lifestyle, gaming culture, and all that fun stuff with

00:50.260 --> 00:53.360
my co-host, the one, the only, Dark Sakura, Jamie Sommers.

00:53.360 --> 00:54.360
Filodo.

00:54.360 --> 00:55.360
What?

00:55.360 --> 00:56.360
Filodo.

00:56.360 --> 01:01.280
I am. Well, it's kind of, it's Greek. I'm having spinach pie.

01:01.280 --> 01:02.280
Spinach pie.

01:02.280 --> 01:04.240
Like spanakopita, only big.

01:04.240 --> 01:06.120
Okay, it sounds good.

01:06.120 --> 01:09.200
It's Greek. There's plenty.

01:09.200 --> 01:13.240
And say hello, I just know feta cheese, that's Greek too, and the olives, they're really

01:13.240 --> 01:17.960
good. All right, also say hello to, I'm ignorant, say hello to tech master Loki.

01:17.960 --> 01:21.760
What she meant to say is Filodo.

01:21.760 --> 01:26.200
The secret ingredient is Filodo.

01:26.200 --> 01:31.360
Just doing a speaker check, everybody out there. Make sure your levels are Loki appropriate

01:31.360 --> 01:34.280
tonight for him to scream in the microphone. How you doing, Loki?

01:34.280 --> 01:35.280
I'm doing fine.

01:35.280 --> 01:40.040
Awesome. All right. Always present with us, the chat room, the fourth guest on the program,

01:40.040 --> 01:44.480
chat.orangeloungeradio.com. If you want to join us on this Sunday night with us as we

01:44.480 --> 01:50.880
are taping episode number 425 of our show live. So, um, I don't know about you guys,

01:50.880 --> 01:55.520
I've had a pretty busy day. I was on another podcast this morning for a good, God, it probably

01:55.520 --> 01:58.120
went for about two, two and a half hours, but it was a good show.

01:58.120 --> 01:59.120
Was it fun?

01:59.120 --> 02:02.840
It was fun. I was hanging with my sassy British friends on the girls gone wow podcast, which

02:02.840 --> 02:07.320
I know is funny because I'm not a girl, but, uh, it doesn't matter. It's still a good time.

02:07.320 --> 02:10.520
And, uh, the girls that are on the show are very fun.

02:10.520 --> 02:12.960
They took my suggestion and called you Sky and called him Rob.

02:12.960 --> 02:17.040
Yes, they did. They did. I didn't know that was your suggestion. Good for you. So anyway,

02:17.040 --> 02:21.280
I was doing that this morning, so a cheap plug for them. That works. And, um, yeah.

02:21.280 --> 02:24.800
Uh, before we get into gaming weeks, I want to talk about this because this is something

02:24.800 --> 02:29.640
I was kind of doing this weekend as well. And, um, so I haven't mentioned this on Twitter

02:29.640 --> 02:32.440
and I haven't really talked about this anywhere because I wanted to just kind of start off

02:32.440 --> 02:36.560
the nice show talking about this, but, um, I did something to one of my consoles that

02:36.560 --> 02:42.560
I haven't done in a very long time since maybe the PlayStation one. And that is my Nintendo

02:42.560 --> 02:48.880
Wii. Um, I hacked it. I loaded up the homebrew channel on it and all the other fun stuff,

02:48.880 --> 02:54.440
uh, that you can do with it. The, like the, uh, loader and all that stuff. And, uh, yeah,

02:54.440 --> 02:58.200
I did it. And you might be thinking like, well, okay, Rob, why did you do that? And

02:58.200 --> 03:03.160
the answer is, well, cause I could, um, I'm going to be totally just blunt and honest.

03:03.160 --> 03:07.720
Um, I read that article on joystick.com. I don't know how many of you guys saw this,

03:07.720 --> 03:10.560
but a joystick ran an article a couple of days ago. You know them, they're a very big

03:10.560 --> 03:14.320
blog gaming blog. They have their own show. It's huge on iTunes. I'm sure many of you

03:14.320 --> 03:20.080
subscribe. Um, there, as far as like the, um, more corporate blogs go, I guess you could

03:20.080 --> 03:24.400
say, they're definitely one of the better ones. Um, and it's because of interesting

03:24.400 --> 03:29.360
things like this that they do that make them stand out. And, uh, they ran an article Thursday

03:29.360 --> 03:34.640
or Friday, uh, about Xenoblade coming out in Europe. And the article was basically how

03:34.640 --> 03:40.400
to play Xenoblade on a US Wii. And it basically was, here is what you need to download. Here

03:40.400 --> 03:45.160
is how you hack your console. And here's where you buy your import copy of Xenoblade so you

03:45.160 --> 03:49.800
can play it on the Wii. And I have to admit a lot of what was holding me back before to

03:49.800 --> 03:54.600
hacking my console was it seemed kind of complicated. Like I know Loki was always doing all that

03:54.600 --> 03:58.320
stuff, but you know, Loki, and we've talked about this on the show before, Loki breaks

03:58.320 --> 04:02.560
shit because he can't. That's, and sometimes I break shit when I don't want to break shit,

04:02.560 --> 04:08.020
but it happens. That's just part of the process, part of it for you. And I've not usually been

04:08.020 --> 04:12.320
of that same mindset, but when I found out, you know, when I was reading that joystick

04:12.320 --> 04:16.640
article, I was like, well, shit, this looks really easy. So, I mean, it looks lengthy,

04:16.640 --> 04:22.760
but it looks easy. So I followed it step by step and I did it. It was, it was pretty easy

04:22.760 --> 04:26.480
and I got to admit it was kind of neat seeing like all the, uh, you know, cause when you're

04:26.480 --> 04:30.680
doing some of this stuff, you basically are booting your Wii, like it's a PC. And so it

04:30.680 --> 04:34.920
has kind of like that old school IBM PC font and you see all these programs that are running

04:34.920 --> 04:40.520
in that and so forth. So, um, it's Linux loaders. I don't even know what the hell's going on.

04:40.520 --> 04:44.360
I just kind of followed all the instructions and there you go. So now if I want to import

04:44.360 --> 04:50.880
Xenoblade, I can, um, I don't know how I feel about that right now. I really, really do

04:50.880 --> 04:57.160
not like this whole region. I don't like region locking. I don't like the fact that some games

04:57.160 --> 05:00.760
come out in one region and don't come out in the other. I love so much more what Sony

05:00.760 --> 05:04.920
is doing. And maybe I think that was part of my big motivator was that I just wanted

05:04.920 --> 05:10.480
to make my Wii region free and now I can check out some of this other cool shit about, uh,

05:10.480 --> 05:19.040
like what custom Mario Kart Wii and so forth and what you can play president cat. Yes,

05:19.040 --> 05:23.040
I could play president cat. I didn't even think of that, but that's a damn good reason

05:23.040 --> 05:27.120
for me to have done what I did in my way. I could, if there's any game worth importing,

05:27.120 --> 05:32.600
it's that one. If I could even find a copy anymore, I have a copy. Really? Yeah. I would

05:32.600 --> 05:37.280
like to borrow president cat. I bought a copy of present cat, played it once and it sits

05:37.280 --> 05:42.600
in the shelf somewhere. I knew there was a good reason I did this. Uh, and I, I realized

05:42.600 --> 05:46.880
some folks out there that are very anti hacking and all that are like, Rob, how could you,

05:46.880 --> 05:50.080
you've been the voice of reason on the show for so long. How could you do this? Well,

05:50.080 --> 05:54.880
if you want to know how he could do it, the instructions were on joystick at the end of

05:54.880 --> 06:01.160
the day. Yes, that's exactly right. Somebody wrote an article like how to do this for dummies

06:01.160 --> 06:06.400
and I was like, all right, I can do it. And I did it. And in some ways I realized I was

06:06.400 --> 06:10.120
taking a risk with my Wii console that, you know, I might break it or something like that.

06:10.120 --> 06:17.200
Uh, and um, uh, I said, well, the Wii is pretty much a dead system to me right now. Like maybe

06:17.200 --> 06:21.560
I'll play that new Zelda game, but that's about it. Uh, I otherwise am not afraid of

06:21.560 --> 06:27.720
breaking my console if I break it. Oh, Wells. I wasn't really playing it anyway. Um, so I did it.

06:27.720 --> 06:34.800
Um, and that's, that's that. You're such a naughty boy. Well, I didn't, I didn't go crazy on bit

06:34.800 --> 06:40.160
torn or anything like that. That was not my motivation for hacking the Wii. Um, you know,

06:40.160 --> 06:46.880
so I want to make that clear. Um, I think it's interesting that I could use the USB loader to

06:46.880 --> 06:51.760
like load up my games onto one drive, but I don't know. I don't know if I'll really do that because

06:51.760 --> 06:56.160
I honestly think it's just easier to just get the damn disc and put it in the Wii if I'm actually

06:56.160 --> 07:01.520
going to play any of those games. Let's face it. Many of which I don't anymore. Once in a blue,

07:01.520 --> 07:06.160
blue moon, I'll decide there's something on the Wii I want to play. Usually it's a virtual console

07:06.160 --> 07:13.720
game, to be honest. Um, so there you go. Loki, what do you think of, uh, now I, now I could ask

07:13.720 --> 07:20.200
this question. What do you think of the fact that a big blog like joystick did this? Because clearly

07:20.200 --> 07:23.840
they did it to make a statement. Like at least that's what I read out of it. They did it to make

07:23.840 --> 07:30.280
a statement that Nintendo by not releasing Xena blade in the U S we, you leave us no other choice.

07:30.280 --> 07:34.760
I think they've run an article similar to that before anyways. And I know they've done it before

07:34.760 --> 07:42.680
with the PSP. So yeah, I'm not surprised. Hmm. What do you think dark soccer? What do you think

07:42.680 --> 07:47.440
of a website like that? Kind of a, you know, a prestigious, if we will gaming website. They're

07:47.440 --> 07:51.200
kind of doing that. They're going to get a cease and desist from Nintendo and then take the article

07:51.200 --> 07:56.800
down. But the damage has been done. Their protest has been made. Do you think that they made a

07:56.800 --> 08:01.560
statement or do you think that they look kind of, you know, and I'm not, I'm not asking this to,

08:01.560 --> 08:07.480
to open any channel of disrespecting what they did, but let's see statemently to me, you know,

08:07.480 --> 08:14.120
yeah, I think they did. I'm well done. So now here's the other interesting thing about this

08:14.120 --> 08:20.240
whole Xena blade and the last story in this whole saga, my gut still tells me we've got packs coming

08:20.240 --> 08:25.120
this weekend and there's going to be a lot of news that comes out of packs. I think that usually you

08:25.120 --> 08:30.240
don't have a lot of big, big announcements coming out of packs. Like usually that's what E3 is for

08:30.240 --> 08:36.320
games. Calm usually ends up being a pretty similar show to packs. However, packs has been getting

08:36.320 --> 08:40.840
bigger and bigger. It's been a sellout show. I think you do see companies making more and more

08:40.840 --> 08:47.680
announcements. And honestly, in my mind, what better time to announce Xena blade? I honestly

08:47.680 --> 08:54.480
think if Nintendo does not announce Xena blade at packs next week, they're not going to. I think

08:54.480 --> 08:58.360
next week is really the last quote unquote last chance. I mean, granted, they can hold a press

08:58.360 --> 09:03.520
conference whenever they want and say whatever they want. But as far as a celebration, if you

09:03.520 --> 09:09.320
will, of the fans, next week is the chance for them to do that. Nintendo is in Seattle. They're

09:09.320 --> 09:13.440
in the backyard of Seattle. It's not a problem for them to do packs and they do go I think every

09:13.440 --> 09:17.000
year. Yeah, I think so. Someone in the chat correct me if they're not going this year, but I'm

09:17.000 --> 09:21.920
pretty sure they are. And I would openly question if they're taking the Wii U. I know a lot of

09:21.920 --> 09:27.000
people are assuming that because the Wii U is at E3, that it's going to be at packs. I'm not so

09:27.000 --> 09:31.560
sure that if Nintendo is doing packs, which I still need someone to confirm because I might be

09:31.560 --> 09:36.240
wrong. I'm not so sure if Nintendo is doing packs that they're going to bring the Wii U. And the

09:36.240 --> 09:43.440
reason why is that the Wii U did not get a huge reception at E3. And so they might have taken

09:43.440 --> 09:47.800
things back to the drawing board. They may not be ready to show that to the public. If Nintendo is

09:47.800 --> 09:52.480
going to E3 or excuse me, if Nintendo is going to packs, they're going to be showing off the 3DS.

09:52.480 --> 09:57.080
That's for sure. That'll be their huge thing. Their huge push will be the Mario game, the Mario

09:57.080 --> 10:03.840
Kart, and the 3DS price cut. That is going to be the majority of what they're pushing. But they do

10:03.840 --> 10:09.200
have a handful of titles coming out on the Wii this holiday season, like Rhythm Heaven. There's

10:09.200 --> 10:14.040
another Kirby game, right? It's on its way. So there's a few things that Nintendo kind of still

10:14.040 --> 10:19.240
has going on. And what a perfect time for them to say, oh yeah, and over here on these kiosks we

10:19.240 --> 10:23.800
have, hey, American Xenoblade. I really think the push is going to be more of the 3DS obviously

10:23.800 --> 10:28.040
because they just dropped the system down in price. They've really kicked up the advertising

10:28.040 --> 10:32.760
for it. I don't know if you've seen the ads about, you know, basically highlighting the three big

10:32.760 --> 10:42.320
games from Star Fox, Mario, Mario Kart. You know, so they're definitely pushing. So going to the

10:42.320 --> 10:47.400
chatroom at chat.orangelaungeradio.com, Black Wolf is in chat saying Nintendo won't bring the Wii U

10:47.400 --> 10:52.000
because they only showed it to E3 to stop leaks. And see, I'm kind of inclined to agree is that

10:52.000 --> 10:56.760
maybe not totally the reason why. I think part of the reason why, I think if the Wii U had had a

10:56.760 --> 11:02.120
huge, oh my gosh, everybody's got to do this, and all this whole huge reception at E3, I think they

11:02.120 --> 11:07.360
would have had a little bit of it at PAX. But also keep in mind that the PAX boosts are a lot smaller

11:07.360 --> 11:12.720
than the E3 boosts. And they don't always have as much space to show everything. And if they were to

11:12.720 --> 11:18.320
bring the Wii U, they would have those huge lines that go with it. I just don't think now is the

11:18.320 --> 11:23.600
time for them to be pushing the Wii U. Next year's PAX? Maybe, because we could be looking at the Wii

11:23.600 --> 11:30.200
U for next holiday. But I just think this year's PAX is going to be all about the 3DS. And maybe,

11:30.320 --> 11:33.720
just maybe, Xenoblade. So...

11:33.720 --> 11:36.920
I'm actually entirely inclined to agree with that.

11:38.000 --> 11:42.360
And sg100mad is confirming for me that Nintendo is going to be at PAX. Thank you very much.

11:42.680 --> 11:47.920
UnfoldedRaptor is in our chatroom saying, Sky, the last story, another big RPG for the Wii is getting

11:47.920 --> 11:52.800
localized for Europe, but not for America. I think we'll see this whole situation again in the future.

11:52.800 --> 11:54.360
Oh, absolutely. Absolutely.

11:54.840 --> 11:59.200
Well, this is the last story is still part of that. Whatever that campaign. Yeah.

11:59.200 --> 12:02.880
But otherwise, the games actually do. I mean, they're both RPGs, but that's kind of where the

12:02.880 --> 12:07.680
similarities end. The huge thing about the last story is it's Mistwalker. Meaning like, Nobei

12:07.680 --> 12:12.920
Uematsu did the music. The guy that did the Final Fantasy, the original, is behind this. I mean,

12:12.920 --> 12:18.720
Mistwalker games are usually a pretty big deal. Of course, well, I guess I say that with a grain of salt.

12:18.720 --> 12:22.520
Maybe they're a big deal in Japan. Like, Blue Dragon, I don't think was so well received here.

12:23.520 --> 12:30.560
Lost Odyssey was horrifically underrated. I think that's one of the greatest 360 games as far as RPGs

12:30.560 --> 12:35.840
go, and just kind of landed here with a resounding no one curr, which is really sad. So I'm really

12:35.840 --> 12:44.880
excited to see kind of what they did with the Wii. So let's see. Going to other comments, Unfolded

12:44.880 --> 12:49.040
Raptor is saying Pandora's Tower is also set to get a localization for Europe next year, and that's

12:49.040 --> 12:55.360
the third game. SSG100Matt in chat says, Rob, the funny thing is that not only Nintendo will be

12:55.360 --> 13:03.640
there, but the editors for Joystick will be there. Cat fight? I don't know. Gang fight? I don't know.

13:03.640 --> 13:09.720
You know, I'm not, like, you know, our little dog and pony podcast does not get quite the amount of

13:09.720 --> 13:15.760
viewers that Joystick does, so I'm not sure what kind of happens when you're that big, if you can

13:15.760 --> 13:19.360
get away with more things like that without getting blacklisted or what have you. But I do

13:19.360 --> 13:24.880
seem to remember some time ago, Kotaku did something to piss Sony off, you know, and they're

13:24.880 --> 13:29.160
another big blog, and they got blacklisted for a little while, but it was, well, when I say a little

13:29.160 --> 13:33.920
while, it was literally, like, 48 hours or something. Something was quickly remedied there, so, you

13:33.920 --> 13:39.120
know, a blog that big has a lot of pull, I gotta say. So I don't think Nintendo could just straight

13:39.120 --> 13:45.960
up blacklist them, but, you know, there's things Nintendo could do if they want, so. They could

13:45.960 --> 13:50.680
stomp their little foot and pout. Black Wolf is being a party pooper, saying the last story

13:50.680 --> 13:55.160
soundtrack actually was done by Yoshitaka Suzuki. It was not done by Nobui Matsu. He didn't even do

13:55.160 --> 13:59.400
the theme or anything? That's surprising to me, because he's a part of Mistwalker Studios, so, hmm,

13:59.400 --> 14:04.680
whatever. Let's see. We're gonna get into How Was Your Gaming Week here in just a minute, but let me

14:04.680 --> 14:11.080
go to another kind of random question that popped up in chat from Dhanesh. Hey guys, Mr. Nesh here.

14:11.080 --> 14:15.520
I have a question for OLR. From what information you know at this moment, would you guys buy the

14:15.520 --> 14:24.560
3DS now, or wait for the PlayStation Vita if you could only buy one? Hmm. I already own a 3DS, but

14:24.560 --> 14:30.000
see, I'm in the, see, here's where I'm at, is that I kind of think the systems are spaced far enough

14:30.000 --> 14:36.960
apart, or that if you plan well, you can kind of afford both. I agree. So, but if you're very adamant,

14:36.960 --> 14:40.880
like, no, I only have X amount, and I understand there's students and people on fixed budgets that,

14:40.880 --> 14:47.080
you know, can only afford one or the other, it's really hard right now for me to say, yeah, go for

14:47.080 --> 14:52.520
the Vita, because for the Vita right now, we have a lot of announcements, and we have a lot of, you

14:52.520 --> 14:57.440
know, ideas for games, but now that the Vita is not launching till 2012, there's a part of me that

14:57.440 --> 15:02.960
wonders if it's not gonna have a very similar situation to what the 3DS had, meaning, yeah, it's

15:02.960 --> 15:06.840
gonna launch in March, but there's not gonna be any really good launch games, and then everything

15:06.840 --> 15:12.760
you really want will be out at the holidays. So part of me says, if you think you could have enough

15:12.760 --> 15:17.920
money this holiday, and then again next holiday, I think you're safe to get a 3DS right now, and

15:17.920 --> 15:22.720
then get a Vita later. Otherwise, it really depends on what games you want to play, because if you

15:22.720 --> 15:27.440
want to play Uncharted, 3DS doesn't have anything like that right now, so clearly you need to get a

15:27.440 --> 15:31.840
Vita, but if you want to play Mario, the Vita doesn't have anything like that right now, so you

15:31.840 --> 15:37.320
need to get a 3DS. So I don't have an easy answer. It really depends on what games do you want to

15:37.320 --> 15:40.680
play, because that's the only thing that's setting the two systems apart right now. If you think

15:40.680 --> 15:46.360
about it this way, the two systems don't have any games in common. It's not like the Xbox and the

15:46.360 --> 15:53.360
360. All right, herp derp. The 360 and the PlayStation 3. Incorrect. Okay, what do they have in common?

15:53.360 --> 15:58.560
They might have some franchises that get one game here and one game here, but what games do

15:58.560 --> 16:08.240
the two both have? Lego Harry Potter years 5 through 7. Well, excuse me! Hey, you said none. I just

16:08.240 --> 16:17.120
pissed off a bunch of Harry Potter Lego fans. My bad on that. I will actually say that if it were

16:17.120 --> 16:27.280
me, I'd get 3DS, because I haven't touched our PSP since I was playing Papa Lacrosse, or no, I was

16:27.280 --> 16:31.800
playing Roko Loco. I was playing some back then, but it was about a year. Here's something else to

16:31.800 --> 16:37.360
consider. Do you need that portable device to do other shit for you? Meaning, do you need an

16:37.360 --> 16:42.320
mp3 player as well? Do you want something to surf the web with? I mean, granted, the 3DS does have a

16:42.320 --> 16:49.600
web browser, but it's kind of shit. Terrible! Where the PSP really succeeded, that the original DS,

16:49.600 --> 16:53.840
or DS Lite, whatever you want to call it, kind of didn't do so well, is that, you know, what's

16:53.840 --> 16:58.440
PlayStation's little tagline? It only does everything. Well, that's kind of true when it comes

16:58.440 --> 17:03.880
to PSP versus DS, you know, going back. And what I imagine will continue to be the case in Vita

17:03.880 --> 17:09.480
versus 3DS is that the PS Vita is going to be able to do this other stuff. We have a story later on

17:09.480 --> 17:15.000
tonight about apps that you know from the iPhone are going to be making their way to the Vita. If

17:15.000 --> 17:19.520
you don't have an iPhone, so maybe you have a need for this kind of stuff, then the Vita looks more

17:19.520 --> 17:24.880
appealing. But if you don't need any of that crap, you don't need Facebook, again, because maybe you

17:24.880 --> 17:31.080
have an Android or something, then maybe you're fine with the 3DS. So I know you want me to say

17:31.080 --> 17:35.680
one or the other, but every gamer is different. And it's really about, at the end of the day,

17:35.680 --> 17:40.720
what's the golden rule of gaming? A system is only as good as the games that are on it. And only you

17:40.720 --> 17:45.520
know what games you want to play. So speaking of games you want to play, let's talk about our gaming

17:45.520 --> 17:49.800
weeks. And we usually like to start off the show talking about what video games we have been playing.

17:49.800 --> 17:57.680
SnarkSakura, start us off. Games I have been and am playing right now? Sims 3. I've got everything

17:57.680 --> 18:05.240
up, except for the newest expansion. And I am playing the crap out of it. And then I have been

18:05.240 --> 18:10.240
playing World of Warcraft. And I actually got really burned out last night. Like, I could not,

18:10.240 --> 18:16.080
I played for like five hours. Because I was just sitting here going, buh, buh, buh. I'm gonna play

18:16.080 --> 18:21.480
my paladin. It takes so long to level when you're in the 70s now. I mean, it's faster than it was

18:21.480 --> 18:26.680
with my mage. Because, hi, everything there is undead, and hi, paladin holy, whatever. So I've

18:26.680 --> 18:33.400
been playing a bunch of that. And I've actually played Robot Unicorn Attack for a little bit today.

18:33.400 --> 18:39.640
In Tiny Tower. That's it. Alright. Loki, what have you been up to? You're playing something right now

18:39.640 --> 18:43.480
during the show. What is this that you're checking out right now? I'm playing Earth Defense Force

18:43.480 --> 18:47.880
Insect Arm again. The minute you paused it and it said destroy the anthill, I'm like, oh, this must

18:47.880 --> 18:52.840
be Earth Defense Force. Yes. I actually have been playing a lot of Earth Defense Force this week. My

18:52.840 --> 18:57.240
boss is out of town. Normally he wants to play Grand Theft Auto during our breaks and lunch and

18:57.240 --> 19:03.680
stuff. But since he's gone, and our other co-workers gone, we've only had three people. And so we've

19:03.680 --> 19:10.520
been playing Earth Defense Force all week long. And it's been awesome. I've leveled up my tactical

19:10.520 --> 19:17.560
guy up to tier seven. Trying to level up to tier eight now by farming this first level. And there's

19:17.560 --> 19:24.840
a trick to it, and it also involves a rubber band. Kind of a cheat, I guess. So I will be doing that

19:24.840 --> 19:31.080
during the show because- You haven't cheated anything ever. It's an exploit. It's not necessarily a cheat. I am not,

19:31.080 --> 19:37.080
you know, hacking or anything. Even though I could have done that, but I did not. So I am leveling up

19:37.080 --> 19:43.960
legitimately. I just don't feel like holding the trigger down for three hours. So that's where the

19:43.960 --> 19:49.240
rubber band comes into play. So yeah. That's what I've been doing. You do all the cheating you want in

19:49.240 --> 19:54.520
single player mode. You know what? If you want to cheat the hell out of it when you're by yourself,

19:54.520 --> 19:59.880
then go for it. It's all co-op. There's no cheating. There's no leaderboards. There's nothing. So it's only

19:59.880 --> 20:08.440
for my own benefit. So then the other stuff I've been playing, I played VVVV. And I finished the

20:08.440 --> 20:13.160
game, but I still have to get some of the shiny objects in there. And that game was really hard.

20:13.160 --> 20:20.840
And, you know, frustratingly hard sometimes. But I think that's the point of it. And it was fun.

20:22.200 --> 20:31.160
Let's see what else they play. A little bit of Grand Theft Auto. And I think that's it, actually.

20:31.160 --> 20:38.680
Just those three. Yeah, I don't think I played- I may have turned Tiny Tower on once. I actually, I

20:38.680 --> 20:43.560
probably should download the update for that. So I'll probably do that. And then maybe build some

20:43.560 --> 20:52.280
more empty floors since I can't build anything else. Yeah, that's it. My gaming week. My Xbox is

20:52.280 --> 20:56.840
still out of commission. If you haven't heard the story yet, listen to last week's show at the very

20:56.840 --> 21:01.000
beginning. So I don't really have any updates on that yet. It's just sitting there collecting dust

21:01.000 --> 21:05.560
until that whole debacle's settled down. Because even though I can play things in single player

21:05.560 --> 21:10.440
mode, I don't want to get achievements and stuff. So I don't know. I've just moved on to PlayStation

21:10.440 --> 21:15.960
3, which is what I've been playing mostly in my console gaming time. Not a lot of new stuff for

21:15.960 --> 21:19.800
me to talk about on PlayStation 3. I've been, you know, revisiting some of the old stuff. Played

21:19.800 --> 21:26.680
Katamari randomly during the week. And also was playing a game that I think I briefly talked about

21:26.680 --> 21:30.840
before, like last year on the show when it first came out. But it's Hardcore Uprising. And if you

21:30.840 --> 21:35.000
don't know what this game is, it's basically Contra. But they didn't call it Contra. It's

21:35.000 --> 21:40.680
Hardcore Uprising. And the art is all by Arc System Works and all this. Although it's still

21:40.680 --> 21:45.240
a Konami game. And yeah, it's something that Extifer of all people got me into. If you guys

21:45.240 --> 21:49.640
listen to Hoard House, you know Extifer. And he is really into this game right now. And when we all

21:49.640 --> 21:53.880
went over to his house about a week ago, he was playing it and I was kind of watching him and I

21:53.880 --> 21:58.280
was like, oh, this actually looks kind of fun. Like I don't remember feeling this awesome about

21:58.280 --> 22:05.640
the game after playing the demo. Just because, you know, it's a Contra game. It's really hard. You

22:05.640 --> 22:10.040
have some things that you didn't have in the original Contra like a life bar. Not everything

22:10.040 --> 22:14.360
instantly kills you. Although there is a lot of stuff that will instantly kill you. And what I

22:14.360 --> 22:20.120
really like about Hardcore Uprising is what they call the Uprising Mode. And in the Uprising Mode,

22:20.120 --> 22:25.960
you basically, all your points turn out to be a currency. And you use these points to upgrade

22:25.960 --> 22:31.000
your characters so that the mode can get a little easier and a little easier. Like maybe you can

22:31.000 --> 22:36.520
make your life bar a little bit longer. Or you get yourself a few more lives. Or your power up will

22:36.520 --> 22:42.760
be a little bit stronger next time that you get that power up. So I like being able to progress

22:42.760 --> 22:45.960
that way because that way it doesn't feel like you keep banging your head against the wall because

22:45.960 --> 22:50.120
you keep dying at the same point. You know that as long as you keep racking up points, you'll be

22:50.120 --> 22:53.880
able to get your character more and more powered so that you'll be able to get through all that

22:53.880 --> 23:01.160
stuff. So yeah, that's the cool thing about Hardcore Uprising. And yeah, if you want the

23:01.160 --> 23:05.240
hardcore stuff though, there's Arcade Mode where you don't have any of the power ups and you just

23:05.240 --> 23:10.440
got to push through. And I was excited that I could beat the first stage without continuing,

23:10.440 --> 23:15.640
okay? Like that was- In the Contra game, that's huge. Yeah, it is huge. I'm sorry. So there you

23:15.640 --> 23:21.320
go. And yeah, Zethur's in the chat room going, get all the achievements, try beating it on no

23:21.320 --> 23:28.440
death mode. Good luck with that. That's something that what maybe Dan could do, Jamie's husband Dan?

23:28.440 --> 23:34.840
If that, he used to be able to do really well on Contra a long time ago, but not so much.

23:35.560 --> 23:38.360
I mean, he's just, he's out of practice. It's been a while.

23:38.360 --> 23:45.480
Now, Zethur is also clarifying that it's more of a sequel to the game on the Genesis is where

23:45.480 --> 23:47.480
that comes from. Contra Hardcore.

23:47.480 --> 23:51.960
Yeah, Contra Hardcore. So, all right. I mean, whatever at the end of the day, it's Contra.

23:51.960 --> 23:56.360
That's what it feels. You have a spread gun. You have all the metals and just the music.

23:56.360 --> 23:59.080
Contra Hardcore was pretty dang hard.

23:59.080 --> 24:05.560
Yeah. So, so there you go. That was, that was Hardcore Uprising. And that was pretty much,

24:05.560 --> 24:09.720
you know, other than that, some more PC games, more Civilization V because it's great.

24:10.280 --> 24:14.760
And of course World of Warcraft. So that was my gaming week. All right. Quickly,

24:14.760 --> 24:19.080
some housekeeping before we get into the news tonight. Um, I want to quickly say there is no

24:19.080 --> 24:24.840
show next Sunday. I do believe another best of is being prepped for the live folks that listen

24:24.840 --> 24:29.400
at all games.com. So at least there will be that, but we will not be live next week. Um,

24:29.400 --> 24:33.080
I'm going to be out of town and we're just going to take the week off.

24:33.080 --> 24:34.200
I'm helping somebody move.

24:34.200 --> 24:37.720
It's been a while since we had a week off. So darn it. Sometimes we take a day off. So,

24:37.720 --> 24:41.480
uh, we're taking next week off, but we'll be back in two weeks. It is a little bit of a

24:41.480 --> 24:45.720
bummer that we're missing next week because it is PAX, but just the timing of everything,

24:46.360 --> 24:49.720
not really going to work out. So my hope is that maybe some of our listeners are going to

24:49.720 --> 24:52.920
PAX and they're just not going to be able to tune in because they're flying back or whatever.

24:52.920 --> 24:56.600
So we'll do a big roundup and everything. When we come back on Labor Day weekend,

24:56.600 --> 25:01.240
we will be having a show. So we'll be seeing you guys then. Otherwise, in the meantime,

25:01.240 --> 25:05.480
follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash O L R. We're also on Facebook at facebook.com

25:05.480 --> 25:09.240
slash orange lounge radio. And of course there's always our website,

25:09.240 --> 25:15.480
www dot orange launch radio.com. There's some forums. Um, I noticed that, uh, we had a post

25:15.480 --> 25:18.760
where some of the things that we weren't sure. Remember how last week we had the email that

25:18.760 --> 25:22.360
linked to a deviant art account and we weren't sure if we could post the pictures of the Capcom

25:22.360 --> 25:25.880
building and all this stuff that we were linked. Well, that email or went and made a post in our

25:25.880 --> 25:29.720
forums and was like, Oh, I don't care here at all is. So if you want to kind of like see that

25:29.720 --> 25:33.480
second half to last week's email, it's all there on the forums. So check that out. Orange launch

25:33.480 --> 25:39.000
radio.com. All right, let's get into tonight's news. Loki start us off. Yes. Um,

25:39.000 --> 25:44.280
so start things off. We're gonna talk a little bit about PlayStation and, um,

25:45.880 --> 25:51.560
some interesting stuff came out this week from games.com. First thing, uh, which was kind of

25:51.560 --> 25:56.280
exciting for people is that they dropped the price by 50 bucks. So the PlayStation three systems,

25:56.280 --> 26:03.160
the three twenties dropped down to $300 and the one sixties down to $250. Um,

26:03.160 --> 26:08.520
and I'm sure that's just to kind of pick up the pace for the holiday season because I don't think

26:08.520 --> 26:14.600
they've been a top dog for the last few months. So they kind of have to, well, I guess try a little

26:14.600 --> 26:20.840
harder. So, um, also they're going to be rolling out some new, uh, bundles as well infamous too.

26:20.840 --> 26:25.560
I know there's one for uncharted three that's coming out in the fall. They don't think they've

26:25.560 --> 26:31.080
announced yet. Um, so that stuff will be in the pipeline. Plus, you know, this is the big holiday

26:31.080 --> 26:37.880
where they're pushing their 3d. Um, basically there's themselves as like a 3d platform, uh,

26:37.880 --> 26:44.120
with all the new games supporting 3d from them as well as their 3d monitor TV thing,

26:44.120 --> 26:52.840
whatever you want to call it. Um, so they've got that as well. Um, it'll help drive sales.

26:52.840 --> 26:59.400
That's for sure. Uh, whether, you know, pushes the whole 3d platform. Do you think, do you think

26:59.400 --> 27:03.560
3d gaming is really what people want right now? Like, does anyone in the room really want that?

27:03.560 --> 27:08.600
Like there's a part of me, which I know is ironic because I own a 3ds, but I'm kind of like, eh,

27:08.600 --> 27:13.480
3ds is flashing the pan enough for me. I don't know how I feel about it in my living room. Well,

27:13.480 --> 27:19.000
the thing with the 3d right now, I think is it's just too cumbersome. There's, you know, expensive,

27:19.000 --> 27:24.360
it's expensive. It's, it's still too new to be affordable for everybody. And even like with,

27:24.360 --> 27:30.040
if you buy a 3d TV and stuff, I think it's, it'll be better once it's more of a passive technology,

27:30.040 --> 27:34.920
instead of having these active shutter glasses, it costs a hundred bucks each. I mean, you know,

27:34.920 --> 27:39.720
it needs to be to the point where it's like, okay, here's some polarized glasses. Like,

27:39.720 --> 27:44.360
you know, the crap that you get at the movie theater where that would be, you know, maybe

27:44.360 --> 27:48.120
a few bucks a glass, you know, pair of glasses and then it's all right. Then you can invite

27:48.120 --> 27:52.760
your friends over. You have plenty of glasses to go around for them to do that kind of stuff.

27:52.760 --> 27:57.480
Um, I'm laughing to myself now because speaking of 3d, totally forgot to mention played Ridge

27:57.480 --> 28:05.080
racer 3ds this week. Cause I bought it during the Amazon DS 3ds sale last week. Oops. It's

28:05.080 --> 28:10.760
awesome. Isn't it? It's actually, it's a really good show off the system kind of game. Like if

28:10.760 --> 28:16.040
you want to show off the 3d and shut off some of it's a little gimmicky, like the whole, like,

28:16.040 --> 28:20.440
Oh, there's gotta be confetti flying at your face in every race. And it's, it's kind of bootsy

28:20.440 --> 28:26.280
because the confetti does not go at like 30 frames a second. It looks really bootsy to me. Uh, and

28:26.280 --> 28:31.880
some of the collision is a little dippy. Like it just doesn't control. Like if you run into the

28:31.880 --> 28:36.680
wall on accident, then suddenly your car's like turning at these magical angles. If you can look

28:36.680 --> 28:41.480
over those little silly flaws that that's been in the game for like, I know, I know why. Cause

28:41.480 --> 28:46.120
they don't change the game ever. It's just supported from system. And it's showing, that's

28:46.120 --> 28:50.680
what I'm saying. It's showing it's you look at that stuff and you go, come on. We're this, the

28:50.680 --> 28:55.640
technology is how far along, but otherwise, you know, the 3d effects are pretty good. Uh, and uh,

28:55.640 --> 28:59.720
yeah, I liked it. Sorry. I didn't mean to turn your story into a Ridge Racer 3ds review, but I

28:59.720 --> 29:02.760
just forgot to mention that. That's all right. I know the system that Ridge Racer is really awesome

29:02.760 --> 29:09.640
on the PSP. Um, if you're late to the game and really want to get into, uh, the last generate,

29:09.640 --> 29:16.600
well, soon to be last generation of handhelds from Sony, you can do so for 99 Euro. Um, it's

29:16.600 --> 29:21.880
going to be a new PSP model. That's kind of a different look to it. Uh, more of like a sleek

29:21.880 --> 29:27.160
black. And um, weren't they all sleek black? Oh wait, no. Well, they were shiny. This is more of

29:27.160 --> 29:35.240
like a silver one. This is like a matte finish. Um, and it will not have wifi. It is without

29:35.240 --> 29:42.920
wifi. So if you're thinking of playing multiplayer games, uh, not going to happen.

29:44.840 --> 29:51.080
Interesting that they cut out the wifi. I mean, you know, surf the web. Nope. That is a pretty

29:51.080 --> 29:55.640
big component of the PSP that they, they just kind of chopped out. But at the same time you

29:55.640 --> 30:00.680
look at it and go, eh, but it's only 99 euros, which I imagine would mean $99 here. Although

30:00.680 --> 30:05.400
had they even had, they even announced it for America. It's not coming to America. It's only

30:05.400 --> 30:10.760
in Europe. And why is that? Is that just cause Sony does, does better in Europe? Is this our

30:10.760 --> 30:17.560
punishment for rejecting the go? It's it's not, I mean, if you're really looking for a cheap system

30:18.120 --> 30:22.600
and then this is the problem with this, once again, they're releasing something

30:22.600 --> 30:28.040
that they think is cheap, but it's not. If you're looking for a cheap PSP this late in the game,

30:28.040 --> 30:36.280
just buy used. I mean, seriously, you could buy a PSP 1000 for $65. Um, or, and, and that has

30:36.280 --> 30:43.880
wifi in it. It has all the features that this has and more for less. I mean, so why would you

30:43.880 --> 30:50.040
go and try to buy something brand new for slightly less? And it's really kind of a crippled version

30:50.040 --> 30:56.840
of the system. Same thing was like with what the PSP go was. Why would you buy something,

30:56.840 --> 31:02.440
you know, more expensive that comes crippled? It doesn't make any sense. No one wants that. So

31:05.160 --> 31:08.520
I mean, they might as well make it smaller and call it the PSP micro because that's how it's

31:08.520 --> 31:15.640
going to sell. No one's going to want it. Yeah. Why even bother releasing a new PSP anyways?

31:15.640 --> 31:20.600
It's just, I think people are already done with the PSP. It's kind of at the end of its life

31:20.600 --> 31:28.040
cycle already. Maybe it's kind of their last hurrah for the holiday because the Vita didn't

31:28.040 --> 31:33.560
make it. Cause the Vita didn't make it in Europe either. Put out a new 3000 bundle or something

31:33.560 --> 31:37.480
like that. They just had one that came out with Madden and need for speed in it or something like

31:37.480 --> 31:45.880
that. Uh, in the U S why do we have to, why even bother releasing a new system? Why, why spend the

31:45.880 --> 31:51.880
time right now to redesign the system to make it slightly cheaper to put it out anyways? I mean,

31:51.880 --> 31:55.720
the only thing I can think of is that they're trying to cash in on, um,

31:58.440 --> 32:02.680
on these reduced price games that they have coming out. They have some UMD dual packs.

32:02.680 --> 32:06.840
They're coming out for 10 bucks from a bunch of third party companies. And I mean, it's a good

32:06.840 --> 32:12.120
deal if you're looking for really cheap games and yes, you can still download stuff off the

32:12.120 --> 32:19.000
PlayStation store. If you have a PC or a PlayStation three, you can download it straight off there and

32:19.000 --> 32:24.920
you know, put it on a memory stick or something like that. But I, I mean, seriously, just buy

32:24.920 --> 32:31.080
you system if you're really going to do that. Um, cause there's, there's no reason to buy this. I

32:31.080 --> 32:36.680
mean, seriously, it's just buy you system. Hell, you can probably even find a new system for that

32:36.680 --> 32:45.960
price. I mean, if people are sitting on inventory for it. All right. Well, we see how Loki feels

32:45.960 --> 32:51.320
about that. Um, I don't know. Uh, I, I do have to admit the idea of a new PSP is a little silly

32:51.320 --> 32:56.040
when, yeah, I think Loki makes a damn good argument that if you can get a used one cheaper

32:56.040 --> 33:01.320
than this, then why go for this when you're missing wifi? Uh, before he kind of pointed

33:01.320 --> 33:05.560
that out, I was thinking, all right, well, it's a way for them to get the system out under a hundred

33:05.560 --> 33:11.720
dollars. So it looks really appealing to, you know, maybe, maybe younger folks that kind of

33:11.720 --> 33:15.960
want one, but the parents don't want to spend that much money on a toy. You know what I mean?

33:16.680 --> 33:21.720
But, Hmm. All right. Well, anyhow, let's talk about the other handheld system and that would

33:21.720 --> 33:27.640
be the 3DS as you all I'm sure are aware of the 3DS recently had a huge price cut going on to it.

33:27.640 --> 33:33.720
Uh, and that price cut included Japan and in Japan, the price of the device went from 25,000

33:33.720 --> 33:39.080
yen down to 15,000 yen. That's a huge price. That's, that's almost larger than the one that

33:39.080 --> 33:45.880
had here in the U S uh, so it's very big. Um, and what was the effect of that? Well,

33:45.880 --> 33:51.560
a lot more 3DS is sold and this week it was announced that, uh, let's see, uh,

33:52.600 --> 33:57.880
a couple different figures are out there about exactly how many units sold between August 8th

33:57.880 --> 34:05.640
and August 14th. But generally it's around 210,000 units. Keep in mind that the launch

34:05.640 --> 34:13.720
week of the system saw about what, 350,000 units sold or no 375,000 units sold. So

34:14.360 --> 34:18.440
by cutting the price, you got numbers that were almost back to launch week. I mean,

34:18.440 --> 34:24.840
the numbers this past week were larger than they were in week two and it pushed the, um,

34:24.840 --> 34:34.520
the adoption mark past 1.5 million. So apparently the price cut did exactly what Nintendo needed

34:34.520 --> 34:39.560
it to do and it moved more systems, right? Exactly. It was just an overpriced system.

34:39.560 --> 34:46.200
And right now, I mean, they could have probably, you know, put it out the original price if they

34:46.200 --> 34:50.040
had a good lineup of games, but they didn't. So they need to do something either put out some

34:50.040 --> 34:54.840
good games or drop the price. And right now they need to drop the price if they want to

34:54.840 --> 34:58.440
gain momentum going into the fourth quarter. Well, here's the other thing I want to know about,

34:58.440 --> 35:03.480
and that is what is the sales going to look like the next week? Because I'm sure you had a lot of

35:03.480 --> 35:08.200
running, a lot of people that ran out and bought one, especially in the U S because we had those

35:08.200 --> 35:12.520
stores that all cut the price early so that folks could get on that. And then they could be the

35:12.520 --> 35:16.600
early adopters as well. And I'm sure the sales figures in the U S are going to look very similar

35:16.600 --> 35:20.920
when those numbers come out very soon. But I'm curious, what's it going to look like in two

35:20.920 --> 35:25.880
weeks? What's the long term sales of this? And then of course, through the holiday, I really

35:25.880 --> 35:30.120
don't think any of this matters until the holiday. The holiday is what really going to make or break

35:30.120 --> 35:35.960
the system. Yeah, honestly, it didn't really, from my perspective, it didn't really do much. I mean,

35:35.960 --> 35:41.000
none of my customers are really buying more systems. They were just kind of like, great,

35:41.000 --> 35:44.520
you know, now I can get rid of the system that's been sitting on my shelf for four months.

35:44.520 --> 35:51.240
Wanting to sell the shit they have. Yeah. So, I mean, I don't know if that's the situation.

35:51.240 --> 35:56.200
If, if a lot of the retailers out there were just sitting on these systems, then you may not see

35:56.200 --> 36:01.880
the spike that you see in Japan right now. I mean, I'm sure it'll help, but just, I don't know if

36:01.880 --> 36:07.640
it's going to be, you know, that significant. Uh, Akuma JP is in our chat room right now at

36:07.640 --> 36:12.440
chat.orangeandre.com. And he is a listener of ours from Japan. And he says, uh, kind of in response

36:12.440 --> 36:18.040
to this, a lot of mothers complained because they bought it on the first day. Oh, I'll tell you

36:18.040 --> 36:23.800
something. I'll tell you what you're going to see in this. I guarantee you'll see this by early next

36:23.800 --> 36:29.160
month. You're going to see Nintendo come out because the NPD numbers are going to come out.

36:29.160 --> 36:35.720
3DS is the top handheld system of August. Yeah, because the PSP isn't selling very well. The DS

36:35.720 --> 36:39.960
isn't selling very well. Of course, the 3DS is going to be the top system now that they did a

36:39.960 --> 36:45.720
price drop, but that's, you know, PR spin for you. So look for that early next month. Well, what,

36:45.720 --> 36:50.520
what's the long-term effect of a statement like that? Again, I don't see soccer moms running out

36:50.520 --> 36:55.640
and buying a 3DS because, oh, well, it was the top selling system in August, according to NPD.

36:55.640 --> 36:59.880
Well, they're just hoping that that kind of momentum will carry on. And it very well might,

36:59.880 --> 37:06.440
I mean, cause you know, the DS and the PSP are kind of being phased out. When that Mario game

37:06.440 --> 37:11.720
hits all they have to do. Look, this is all Nintendo has to do. Bundle that fucking Mario

37:11.720 --> 37:18.200
game with a 3DS. That thing will sell like crazy for Christmas. Watch Dan's holding off until the,

37:18.200 --> 37:23.800
the flame one comes out. Cause that's what he wants. He wants the flare red. Yeah. And he wants

37:23.800 --> 37:33.240
the 3D. He likes his 3DS is like, he likes his homosexuals flaming and yeah. Red red stands,

37:33.240 --> 37:38.440
favorite color. And he wants any what? Star Fox. So those are what's selling it for him. I just

37:39.480 --> 37:44.840
like, if Nintendo wants to sell a shit ton of 3DS is that's all they have to do. And like kids

37:44.840 --> 37:49.400
will be wanting that shit all Christmas long. And it'll be a huge thing that ends up under the

37:49.400 --> 37:54.600
Christmas tree this year. It, it might even end up being the must have toy. Like if this shit does

37:54.600 --> 37:59.480
Netflix and all this other stuff, like Nintendo could make this the must have toy. What, what

37:59.480 --> 38:04.360
it's going to be the must have toy. I thought, and this is coming from Activision. I thought

38:04.360 --> 38:10.440
Skylanders was going to be the must have toy. What the fuck is a Skylanders? Exactly. It's

38:10.440 --> 38:14.440
a pain in my ass is what it is right now. And we'll get into that later on, but

38:18.200 --> 38:23.400
it's active. I th I, you know, I, I'm trying to say this without sounding like a fan boy and

38:23.400 --> 38:27.160
believe you, you, you all heard what I said about what I did with my Wii earlier. So look that,

38:27.160 --> 38:30.920
that shows you where I'm at. I think the 3DS will be the top selling system. I think it will

38:30.920 --> 38:39.400
outsell the consoles. Rob's modified his Wii. I needed it to be more versatile. So, but no,

38:39.400 --> 38:45.480
seriously, I think the 3DS will sell more than the, uh, living room consoles because I think

38:45.480 --> 38:52.120
most people that want to have an Xbox 360 already have one. The only maybe kind of possibly that

38:52.120 --> 38:56.200
could screw me on that prediction would be the PlayStation three. I think that the whole price

38:56.200 --> 39:00.760
cut for the PlayStation three, the fact that it plays Blu rays, the fact that it's going to do

39:00.760 --> 39:06.440
3d, I don't underestimate that shit. Do not underestimate the power of that shit. Also

39:06.440 --> 39:12.600
do not underestimate the power of Microsoft. And if they feel that their sales are dipping because

39:12.600 --> 39:18.920
of the PlayStation three dropping in price, they can still drop the price. Remember you angry,

39:18.920 --> 39:26.440
cynical, sarcastic gamers, soccer moms do not think like you. So they are not rational. They

39:26.440 --> 39:32.520
can be, they should be put down immediately when spotted. No, I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

39:32.520 --> 39:37.880
But you know what I mean? No mercy, no remorse. And they will not stop until you are dead.

39:38.600 --> 39:44.440
But that's pretty much that. That's what it is. Like I, I love when I read predictions on gaming

39:44.440 --> 39:48.680
sites from gaming fanboys going, you know, well, this is going to be this way because gamers want

39:48.680 --> 39:53.000
this to do without realizing, well, soccer moms spend more money than gamers do probably at the

39:53.000 --> 39:56.920
end of the day. Why else is the, we, the number one console for so many years, let's be real

39:57.640 --> 40:01.480
because soccer moms by, uh, you know, black ops

40:04.520 --> 40:08.280
and well, actually they do because they don't, they don't read.

40:09.480 --> 40:14.520
So I think the Vita getting out of Nintendo's way, essentially, whether that was intentional

40:14.520 --> 40:20.120
or not. Whereas I think, so I honestly think Sony's just trying to plan a better launch.

40:20.120 --> 40:24.040
I think Sony was starting to realize they did not want to have a launch go like the 3DS has launched.

40:24.040 --> 40:27.240
And if they didn't have the games to back it up, they shouldn't launch their system. I think that's

40:27.240 --> 40:31.960
why they've, they've held it back a little bit, uh, at least in America and Europe. I don't know

40:31.960 --> 40:35.240
why they're still going ahead in Japan. Maybe there's going to be more games out there. I don't

40:35.240 --> 40:41.720
know. So we'll see, but it's just, it's totally cleared the way for 3DS is to just fly these

40:41.720 --> 40:47.720
holidays. We'll see. Maybe I'll be wrong. It's happened before. Spread your wings and fly 3DS,

40:47.720 --> 40:52.040
spread your wings and fly. All right, let's move on to some other stories, Dark Sakura. Well,

40:52.040 --> 40:58.520
better that it spreads that than something else. Anyway, um, moving forward. Well,

40:58.520 --> 41:03.960
Japanese retailers are not going to be, uh, doing much with the Xbox 360 anymore. Um,

41:03.960 --> 41:10.760
it just hit 1.5 million units sold, which is basically that's in six years by the way,

41:10.760 --> 41:17.240
which is basically what the 3DS did in six months. And that was considered selling badly.

41:18.040 --> 41:20.760
You know why it's not doing well over there? Cause they're racist.

41:22.600 --> 41:27.320
The last big Japanese exclusive came out. Idol master two is actually going to be coming

41:27.320 --> 41:32.680
out on PlayStation three now. So, I mean, it's the biggest retailer out there. Geo is cutting

41:32.680 --> 41:37.400
back their stock, but said that they're still going to be available online. By the way,

41:37.400 --> 41:41.000
totally hacking my Xbox next so I can play idle master. Just saying.

41:42.760 --> 41:49.640
Well, I would rather play Hatsune Miku, but anyway, um, at any rate, uh, the quotes going

41:49.640 --> 41:55.000
on saying is, uh, that it is our understanding that Amazon now handles a substantial portion

41:55.000 --> 42:00.120
of Japanese Xbox 360 software sales. So basically there's a, you want it, get it online.

42:00.120 --> 42:09.880
Amazon.co.jp. That's it. We could special order one of those for you. Yeah. What do you think?

42:09.880 --> 42:14.920
Is this, is this really, really bad news for the 360 or is this, eh, all right.

42:14.920 --> 42:20.440
It's not surprising. The system really isn't the system. The games aren't really geared

42:20.440 --> 42:26.920
towards Japanese players. I think, you know, it, this is my thought is that it's sort of like

42:26.920 --> 42:32.200
the reverse Dreamcast or the Saturn. There's a good example of the Saturn.

42:34.040 --> 42:42.040
Sega Saturn in Japan, fantastic. It was top seller. It, it really was well supported,

42:42.040 --> 42:49.080
great games. Over in the US, not so good. Not so good. You know, how many people do you know who

42:49.080 --> 42:53.960
still have like an old, you know, Nintendo just hanging, not Nintendo, uh, a PlayStation sitting

42:53.960 --> 42:58.680
in their closet collecting dust, but never ever played a Saturn. You know, that's over here.

42:59.320 --> 43:04.440
And then you, you sort of got the converse going on now with the Xbox 360 and, and with the Xbox

43:04.440 --> 43:11.560
that it just didn't catch on over there. Maybe it was marketing. Maybe it was that it wasn't a,

43:11.560 --> 43:20.200
uh, a long time trusted brand over there, perhaps. Uh, whatever reason that it is,

43:20.200 --> 43:25.240
but I think that it's, it's the same situation. It's not marketed the right way. It's not pushing

43:25.240 --> 43:30.200
towards that audience. The Saturn over here could have completely dominated the PlayStation because

43:30.840 --> 43:35.240
tech wise, except for the 3D, it was a better system, better sound quality,

43:35.240 --> 43:41.800
a better 2D graphics, better processors, you know, internal, you know, internal memory.

43:41.800 --> 43:52.600
But yeah, if that makes sense. Yeah. So, well, I don't know. I mean,

43:52.600 --> 43:56.840
I don't think it necessarily spells the end of the 360. Certainly they're going to keep pushing

43:56.840 --> 44:02.280
forward. They've done very well in the U S that's for sure. That's the point is that

44:02.280 --> 44:07.000
this performance here has been good enough because I mean, I'm sure the Dreamcast release

44:07.000 --> 44:13.320
in Japan was not based on American sales of the Saturn. I can tell you that, but it could

44:13.320 --> 44:18.200
possibly be that maybe the next Microsoft system to come out won't come out in Japan.

44:19.560 --> 44:24.040
It's not even. That could be very interesting if that happens. I can't, I honestly can't see

44:24.040 --> 44:29.400
that happening. I think Microsoft has to try again. You know what I see if it, if it does

44:29.400 --> 44:37.880
happen that way, we get a system over here that's not region locked or it's only available online.

44:37.880 --> 44:41.320
God, I wish that you know, wish a non region lock system would happen.

44:41.320 --> 44:47.240
Most of the games that come out on the 360 are not region locked. Just saying. I mean,

44:47.800 --> 44:53.240
it's a lot of the Japanese games that come out are for some reason from the Japanese companies,

44:53.240 --> 44:59.400
but for the most part, a lot of like your big first party games like EA or first party,

44:59.400 --> 45:04.040
third party games like from EA, Ubisoft, that kind of stuff. They are not region locked.

45:05.000 --> 45:13.240
You just have to look online either on release sites or on, um, like a play Asia has a good list

45:13.240 --> 45:17.320
of, you know, stuff that's not region locked and you can literally import that stuff back and forth.

45:17.320 --> 45:20.760
There are a few Japanese games do come out over there region free and you can bring them over

45:20.760 --> 45:26.360
here. There was some of the cave shmups that were region free, but, um, you know, it's rare.

45:26.360 --> 45:31.320
It's definitely more rare, but, um, you know, if you really want to, you can play some games,

45:31.320 --> 45:35.320
you know, way before they come out over here. Like for example, all the IDOS games come out over

45:35.320 --> 45:40.120
in the UK a lot earlier than they come out over here. So you can play some of that stuff.

45:40.680 --> 45:45.480
Well, I seriously think that if they were going to be smart about it and try to,

45:45.480 --> 45:51.320
I guess, avoid the same situation, then when they bring out a US game, they have a Japanese

45:51.320 --> 45:59.720
subtitle on it already or a Japanese menu that's just available through options. Because, I mean,

45:59.720 --> 46:04.600
I don't know how many Japanese games I have that have menus fully in English, so it's not a big

46:04.600 --> 46:08.840
deal. And even if the next system is region locked, most likely it's going to be on blu-ray or some

46:08.840 --> 46:14.040
sort of proprietary format. I'm going to guess probably blu-ray. Um, and, um, I think that's

46:14.040 --> 46:19.560
because of blu-ray. Um, and if that's the case, we're the same region as Japan anyways, blu-ray

46:19.560 --> 46:25.640
wise. Uh, video, I mean. No we're not. Yes we are. No we are not. It's region A. They're both the

46:25.640 --> 46:30.200
same. Oh, well, for blu-ray. I'm sorry, I was thinking DVD. We're not the same for DVD. Well,

46:30.200 --> 46:35.560
yes, not for DVD. For blu-ray, we are the same region. But regardless, the point that I was

46:35.560 --> 46:39.560
trying to make is that if they're going to be smart about this, they'll keep, they'll have all

46:39.560 --> 46:46.120
one already, I wouldn't say fully localized, but they will have menus. Or, you know, even work

46:46.120 --> 46:53.720
with, um, you know, between the Japanese staff and American staff for, um, for, uh, uh, two

46:53.720 --> 47:00.280
country developers, you know what I mean? And, uh, then release, you know, a version that's got

47:00.280 --> 47:05.000
just everything in it already. Like, like, okay, here's an example. Sonic Adventure, when it came

47:05.000 --> 47:10.600
out in the US, had Japanese subtitles and the Japanese voices in it, and the English voices.

47:11.560 --> 47:14.760
Can I ask this real quick, because Brakeman's asking this in the chat room, and this is a

47:14.760 --> 47:18.440
really good question that I, I don't even, I'm not even sure I know the answer to this.

47:19.000 --> 47:24.600
Uh, Brakeman in chat asks, OLR, seriously, why is region locking so important to these companies?

47:24.600 --> 47:29.000
What's the point? I know part of it has to do with demographics. It's licensing, right?

47:29.000 --> 47:34.920
Usually they will license stuff for certain regions. Um, you know, obviously some of them,

47:34.920 --> 47:41.960
they just kind of don't put it in there. Branding 2. Branding 2. Um, I can see we're like the NFL

47:41.960 --> 47:47.400
games, you know, NFL's very protective about their shit. And so I'm sure those NFL games have to be

47:47.400 --> 47:53.000
region locked. No, they're not. What'd you say that for? They're not region locked. They're not?

47:53.000 --> 47:57.640
They're not. You've got to be kidding me. No, I'm not kidding. Oh my God. All right. I would've,

47:57.640 --> 48:02.840
I would've guessed for sure. The sports games have the licensing thing. I know to the black

48:02.840 --> 48:07.640
cauldron here of, uh, going back to the roots of OLR, how we were about music games, remember

48:07.640 --> 48:12.680
Konami and all the games, like, you know, all the machines that you saw over here were being

48:12.680 --> 48:16.920
imported from Japan and they really technically weren't supposed to be, they were quote unquote

48:16.920 --> 48:21.480
illegal. Um, but it was kind of one of those things they didn't really enforce. Konami just

48:21.480 --> 48:26.280
kind of quietly turned their backs to it because, you know, obviously it was raising awareness for

48:26.280 --> 48:30.120
all the console versions, but it did actually have an official us machine, right? Those songs

48:30.120 --> 48:35.720
were licensed for Japan. And when it comes to, it's kind of similar, I think to like a jukebox

48:35.720 --> 48:38.840
license or something. When you play music in a store like that, you know, you're actually

48:38.840 --> 48:45.640
supposed to be paying the record labels for all that crap. So, and a lot of the stuff though,

48:45.640 --> 48:50.760
cause, um, they had that deal with, uh, Avex for some of their games and then, um,

48:50.760 --> 48:56.920
all the, uh, what am I thinking? Dance Mania stuff. So it's a little back and forth with,

48:56.920 --> 49:03.080
uh, Madden. Well, Madden, um, Madden has been region free the last couple of games, um, 10

49:03.080 --> 49:09.560
and 11 were both region free. NCAA football though in the US this year was not region free.

49:09.560 --> 49:16.920
It was only, uh, NCSC. Um, then for example, some games that are coming out that are already

49:16.920 --> 49:24.760
leaked out, uh, DSX, uh, human revolution region free, uh, Colorado is the cartel. That's also

49:24.760 --> 49:34.200
region free. Uh, captain America was region free. Harry Potter was region free. Uh, there's

49:34.200 --> 49:39.880
a tour to France game that came out, uh, not even in our region, but that's both region,

49:39.880 --> 49:44.760
uh, for pal and NTSC kind of funny there. That's a game that's never came out. Now over

49:44.760 --> 49:51.480
here, not that I'd play it, but whatever. Um, UFC personal trainer, Naughty Bear gold

49:51.480 --> 49:59.320
edition, uh, dynasty warriors three. Um, it's just a lot of, a lot of games. A lot of them

49:59.320 --> 50:04.360
are coming out all region. They just don't really advertise it. However, though, a lot

50:04.360 --> 50:08.520
of times you'll see the Japanese only games like red faction Armageddon in Japan as only

50:08.520 --> 50:12.760
a Japanese region game, same with like Sean White and that kind of stuff. But, uh, the

50:12.760 --> 50:19.960
versions that come out over here, I believe, um, are all region. In fact, go to our chat

50:19.960 --> 50:23.960
room real quick. Again, chat that orange on studio.com Frisbee asks, but like, for example,

50:23.960 --> 50:27.800
if I buy a Japanese game from a website in Japan, would that affect licensing seeing

50:27.800 --> 50:32.360
as you buy it from that country? Um, I think what you're talking about, I think you kind

50:32.360 --> 50:35.960
of answered your own question because you know, when you're buying a game from Japan,

50:35.960 --> 50:41.240
well, your money went to a Japanese company. I will tell you this. Most, um, Japanese,

50:41.240 --> 50:51.240
uh, sites will not mail to the US. Um, like for example, Amazon. Um, I've ordered, you

50:51.240 --> 50:57.240
know, I've ordered like a couple of books and a couple of CDs. Um, but other than that,

50:57.240 --> 51:01.480
I haven't ever been able to order games from there. They won't take your credit card information.

51:01.480 --> 51:06.520
When I was ordering my, because I had the money I was going to order my 2DX controller,

51:06.520 --> 51:10.760
it wouldn't take my credit card. It wouldn't ship. Even when I was going to ship to a Japanese

51:10.760 --> 51:15.560
address to then ship to me, it would not take my credit card. Some of these stores over here that

51:15.560 --> 51:19.160
sell the import stuff, the way they're doing it is that they have an alliance with a Japanese

51:19.160 --> 51:22.760
retailer who's feeding them all the goods. I mean, that's, that's how they do it. Toys

51:22.760 --> 51:28.120
and Joys is out of Hawaii. So they actually bring stuff back. That's how they get it really quickly.

51:28.120 --> 51:32.120
Well, a lot of like companies are selling to these guys. I'm assuming that it's Japanese

51:32.120 --> 51:37.720
distributors for games and stuff like that. It's basically, you know, as long as we're

51:37.720 --> 51:43.800
shipping to a country or a location within that country, it doesn't really matter what you do

51:43.800 --> 51:49.960
with it. We don't want to know what you do with it. It's just, you know, if you're going to

51:49.960 --> 51:53.560
distribute it in another country, you're not really supposed to do that. But once again,

51:53.560 --> 51:59.080
we're just selling it to that person. What they do with it from there, you know, that's a whole

51:59.080 --> 52:09.080
other thing. All right, well, it is kind of stupid that they have region locks stuff on there, but

52:09.080 --> 52:14.360
quite the conversation we've had stemming from the Xbox 360 chat in Japan. But let's move on.

52:14.360 --> 52:17.720
We got some more stories to cover here before we get to release dates and then the classic game of

52:17.720 --> 52:22.600
the week. The PlayStation Vita, there's some more information that came out about it. It was rumored

52:22.600 --> 52:27.560
that the RAM was halved to drop the price of the system so that it would be able to compete with

52:27.560 --> 52:35.320
the 3DS. However, that is not true. The PlayStation Vita actually has more RAM than the PlayStation 3

52:35.320 --> 52:43.800
in some cases and also a few other things. They also have cross-game chat and you can also do,

52:43.800 --> 52:55.240
I guess it's part of their party system. The system has 512 MB of RAM and 128 MB of video RAM

52:55.240 --> 53:03.240
compared to the PlayStation 3's 256 MB of system RAM and 256 MB of video RAM. While, of course,

53:03.240 --> 53:09.000
the RAM is smaller on the video side, the resolution isn't as great as the PlayStation 3,

53:09.000 --> 53:15.000
so it doesn't require as much RAM for textures and stuff as the PlayStation 3 is. But definitely

53:15.000 --> 53:21.640
with that kind of RAM in there will allow a lot more flexibility with different games and stuff

53:21.640 --> 53:27.240
because I know a lot of people have to optimize their game and do different things and cut stuff

53:27.240 --> 53:35.080
just to, you know, have it run in the limited RAM. So that's kind of cool. So we'll see some

53:35.080 --> 53:41.160
pretty good games coming on that system, I'm guessing, because of that. We can hope. That's

53:41.160 --> 53:47.480
good. I guess RAM's getting cheaper overall, huh? Oh yeah, it's dirt cheap. All right, moving on,

53:47.480 --> 53:50.520
talking about the Vita and some of the other things that were announced for the Vita this

53:50.520 --> 53:55.240
week at Gamescom, PlayStation Vita is going to be getting some more social integration.

53:56.120 --> 53:59.880
In fact, they're going to get some of the things that you usually hear about when you think about

53:59.880 --> 54:05.960
more of the iOS type of apps, or I guess you could say Android as well. Things like Foursquare, Skype,

54:06.600 --> 54:12.440
Twitter, Facebook, all of that is going to be in the PlayStation Vita. And I guess that's part of,

54:12.440 --> 54:17.160
you know, what you can use the whole 3G and all that for. Remember the AT&T 3G that everybody

54:17.160 --> 54:21.800
was really excited about? All four of those apps, they're going to be free downloads from the

54:21.800 --> 54:29.080
PlayStation Network. Doesn't quite say, you know, they didn't hint at if it's going to be at launch

54:29.080 --> 54:33.960
or if it's going to be a ways after that. I imagine none of these apps are that complicated.

54:33.960 --> 54:38.120
I'm sure they'll be out, you know, what else is also interesting about them is I believe all of

54:38.120 --> 54:43.240
them, except maybe Skype, have open APIs. So they ought to be really easy to develop the apps.

54:43.240 --> 54:49.000
Somebody to get in there and do them. So I can't imagine it will be much further after launch if

54:49.000 --> 54:54.280
it's not at launch. So it could be and some are theorizing that maybe they're just going to be

54:54.280 --> 54:58.280
right on the device when you get them. You won't even have to download them. They'll just be free

54:58.280 --> 55:03.400
and on the device waiting for you to use. That'd be nice. Yep. So there you go. All that integration

55:03.400 --> 55:08.440
is going to be there. What do you guys think? I think that Skype specifically is interesting,

55:08.440 --> 55:14.200
of course, because Skype is now a Microsoft product. But, you know, I don't think that

55:14.200 --> 55:19.960
necessarily means that Skype is all things Microsoft and only all things Microsoft at this

55:19.960 --> 55:24.760
point anymore. I just think that's it. And that was probably something planned well before the

55:24.760 --> 55:29.880
purchase of Skype. But what about the rest of this integration? Is this a good thing for the

55:29.880 --> 55:34.920
Vita? Is this a bad thing? Is this a no one really gives a shit type of thing? That's kind of where

55:34.920 --> 55:40.360
I'm at with it is I'm like, well, I guess some of the things are cool. Like if you don't have an

55:40.360 --> 55:44.120
iPhone or an Android or some of the one of the other phone devices that runs all this stuff. But

55:44.920 --> 55:53.080
I mean, I can't really see using Twitter on my PS Vita because, like, how often do I use Twitter

55:53.080 --> 55:59.080
on my Xbox 360? Let me think. Oh, never. I used it once to say, hey, I'm writing a tweet for my

55:59.080 --> 56:04.040
360. I think everybody did now. I think, though, that you would use it a bit more on like a Vita

56:04.040 --> 56:08.680
than you would, say, at 360 because I'm taking it with. I agree. At least at least the Vita's on

56:08.680 --> 56:12.520
the go with you. And it makes more sense for things like four square and so forth. But again,

56:12.520 --> 56:18.360
I own an iPhone. I don't need it in a Vita. Yeah, but I understand not everybody's like me. You

56:18.360 --> 56:23.720
might have a college kid who doesn't really want to pay the amount you have to pay a month to have

56:23.720 --> 56:28.600
an iPhone. So they have, like, a cheaper phone that just gets the calling job done at calling

56:28.600 --> 56:33.160
and texting in the basics. And then, you know, we'll have the Vita to do all this fancier stuff

56:33.160 --> 56:39.720
like the check ins and so forth. Facebook status updates. I'm thinking this also paves the way for,

56:39.720 --> 56:44.120
you know, I don't know this. I don't know how I feel about this in a lot of games, but it will

56:44.120 --> 56:48.120
pave the way for games to automatically post to your Facebook and your Twitter.

56:48.840 --> 56:53.640
I just got to level three. Whoopee. Well, they already have a lot of stuff. I know. Oh,

56:53.640 --> 56:59.640
I know they do, but not as much as I would think. And especially, like, you don't see it in any 3DS

56:59.640 --> 57:08.440
games that I know of. Um, and if they are, they're not first party. There's a DS game. I know that

57:08.440 --> 57:13.080
has that. Okay. Like one DS game, right? You know, there's not, there's not, you don't see it in a

57:13.080 --> 57:16.840
lot of the games right now. Whereas I think including this stuff on the PS Vita kind of

57:16.840 --> 57:22.600
opens the door for more of that stuff. I don't, do people want that? Do people really want that?

57:22.600 --> 57:27.960
Their Twitter to just be filled up with, yay, I unlocked a trophy. Whoopee. I mean, I guess I have

57:27.960 --> 57:34.280
the trophy stuff post to my Facebook, which I kind of show that more as a way to kind of like tell

57:34.280 --> 57:38.440
people what games I'm really into right now without having to put an update. But some of

57:38.440 --> 57:43.240
it's really cumbersome. Like I would not want updates to go up. Like you can have your thing

57:43.240 --> 57:47.240
announced to Facebook every time you download something. And I think that's retarded. I mean,

57:47.240 --> 57:58.120
ridiculous. That's too much. Porn, porn, porn, porn, porn. So yeah. Uh, break man in our chat

57:58.120 --> 58:05.400
room says, can I get a Vita that just plays video games? Can it be cheaper then? Break man also says

58:05.400 --> 58:15.080
fucking Facebook. Can I pay extra to have that not installed? Yikes. No word on Google plus or as we

58:15.080 --> 58:18.840
call it on Hoard House, Google positive. No word if Google positive will be one of the apps that

58:18.840 --> 58:23.800
will be on the PlayStation Vita. All right. Uh, also one of the quick thing I got to say about

58:23.800 --> 58:28.680
the Vita, apparently one other thing that they're saying, every PlayStation Vita game will also be

58:29.400 --> 58:36.200
downloadable to what storage on the PlayStation Vita because there is no storage on the Vita

58:36.200 --> 58:45.000
memory cards. Yeah. Why would I buy, why would I buy the game? Think about this. Not only can you

58:45.000 --> 58:51.160
buy the cartridge version of the game for the same price, you can download it off the internet

58:52.040 --> 58:58.360
and you could buy a memory card to put it on. Why would I do that? That's stupid. Why would you

58:58.360 --> 59:02.840
do that? And no, I guarantee there's not going to be a discount for buying it online. There never is

59:02.840 --> 59:07.000
a fucking discount. Well, what if you're a PlayStation plus subscriber? Maybe you'll get

59:07.000 --> 59:16.440
a discount. Please. Come on. Okay. So I don't know. That's just stupid. But what if, Loki,

59:16.440 --> 59:22.440
what if you have to have the game right now and I'm so fat that I can't fit my car anymore.

59:23.000 --> 59:27.480
So I will not be able to drive to the store to get it, but I have to have the game right now.

59:29.240 --> 59:35.960
Well, that's great. You can also purchase a digital copy that you can't resell. Can't

59:35.960 --> 59:42.520
sell it used again. So, you know, um, and it will cost you more money because you have to buy a

59:42.520 --> 59:48.360
memory card. That's win win. But at least I didn't have to buy the gas to get down to buy. Yeah,

59:48.360 --> 59:54.360
come on. If the gas is that much of a problem for you and you know what you.

59:57.720 --> 01:00:03.960
I'm sorry, gas is not that expensive yet. It's not going to cost you a gallon of gas to get down

01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:09.480
there. And I guarantee that memory card, you know, it's going to be more than a few bucks.

01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:13.240
It's probably like, well, tiger claw on our chat saying memory cards are cheap nowadays.

01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:19.480
Yeah. Regular memory cards are cheap nowadays, but this is Sony's proprietary memory card.

01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:24.600
Just like, you know, Microsoft has their, it's not even really proprietary. It's a proprietary

01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:30.360
case that we put a laptop hard drive in that we can charge a lot more money for our memory cards

01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:35.320
or, or even how they've gone to the point where they're like, Hey, we got some USB memory cards

01:00:35.320 --> 01:00:39.560
that you can use that, you know, I know you can use any thumb drive out there. That's, you know,

01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:45.480
really cheap, but ours are $50 for four gigs or whatever was like, come on.

01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:51.080
That's like the, uh, three DS or not three DS. I'm sorry. The Nintendo, we SD cards,

01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:55.880
you know, the, we will take any SD card, but if you want to get a Nintendo, we SD card

01:00:55.880 --> 01:01:00.920
that has the little sticker that says Nintendo, we on it, it costs like twice as much sticker

01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:04.120
that says we, by the way, they're just like SanDisk cards or something like that. But

01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:09.480
they're actually like another company that makes them obviously. Um, it, it's just,

01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:14.040
unless you're getting some sort of discount on it, like it's half the price,

01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:20.600
then I see no reason this, which, which Sony may do those kinds of crazy sales online or,

01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:25.400
and, and see, I don't understand why they, well, I understand why they have proprietary memory cards

01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:29.000
because they don't want people hacking the system, but at the same time, and I was kind of shocked

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:33.720
because I had to buy my mom a camera, a Sony camera, and I'm like, okay. And he's like,

01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:38.120
okay, you can pick one of these new memory cards here. And they're like, you know, SDHC cards.

01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:43.480
I'm like, wait a second. Uh, don't I have to get a memory stick? No, they stopped using

01:01:43.480 --> 01:01:48.840
memory stick a while ago. I'm like, thank God, you know, get with the program using,

01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:54.360
you know, common format. Um, so that was kind of cool that they have that, but I don't understand

01:01:54.360 --> 01:01:59.720
why they don't take those anyways. Um, on top of their, well, I understand once again, it's

01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:06.120
piracy. They're worried about people targeting it. It will still happen. I was gonna say,

01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:12.360
how long will that last before it invents a reader or something? It's not even gonna need

01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:17.640
a reader. It's just those have USB cables that plug into the computers that you can download

01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:23.400
stuff through those cards. So yeah, that'll take a long time. All right, we'll see what happens.

01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:27.720
All right. Meanwhile, Dark Sakura has got a story for us. Then we're gonna get to the release dates.

01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:36.200
Nintendo says, I'm sorry, my bad. Uh, basically when Xenoblade came out in the UK, if you bought

01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:42.920
it in a, if you pre-ordered in a store, you'd get, um, an exclusive classic controller. It was

01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:49.960
red and you could get three A1 size posters signed by the developer, but they did not specify that

01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:58.120
if you did your pre-orders online, you would not be getting the posters. And they said, oops, if you

01:02:58.120 --> 01:03:02.280
previously placed an online pre-order to get these posters sent with your copy of the pre-order

01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:06.520
bundle, please get in contact with game or game station using links. Yeah, they've got links on

01:03:06.520 --> 01:03:11.240
there. So basically if you're in the UK and you pre-ordered, um, online and wanted your poster and

01:03:11.240 --> 01:03:16.040
were under the impression you'd be getting a poster, um, contact the retailer and tell them

01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:21.640
that Nintendo sucks. It's just a fucking poster. And it's not even, it's not even personally

01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:26.040
signed. It's digitally signed by the developer. So it's basically photoshopped on there. They

01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:32.120
did not have their pens out. It's photoshopped. It was, it was the robo pen. It's what it was.

01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:37.240
Just like Obama uses to sign pens. Is that the digipen? Well, you know, there's a company,

01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:46.840
digipen. It's photoshopped. Oops. So yeah. But still, I mean, I, I, I get it though.

01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:50.040
As much as I'm giving these people a hard time for being mad about their posters,

01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:54.280
I understand the fact that it is principle and I understand the fact that Nintendo hasn't been

01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:59.000
making a lot of smart decisions lately. So why not, you know, kick a little more dirt at them.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:02.040
And if you pre-ordered online in America, you're just not getting the game.

01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:08.600
Exactly. Here's a lovely poster you can have as a parting gift.

01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:12.920
All right, let's move on to travel the world and look at some release dates and what's coming out

01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:17.640
to a store near you quite soon. Well, I hope this week that you're interested in a certain

01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:23.240
Square Enix game called Deus Ex Human Revolution. That'd be coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox

01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:28.680
360. Also, they have a special edition called the augmented edition. Oh, and also on PC.

01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:32.520
Um, I hope you're interested because that's really, that's all that's coming out this week.

01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:36.520
That's brand new. However, if you want some cheaper games from Nintendo, they'll be happy

01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:43.240
to send you their Wii Selects games, including now, uh, Super Mario Galaxy, Super Paper Mario,

01:04:43.240 --> 01:04:52.200
Super Mario Strikers Charged and Punch Out, all for $19.99. That's it. Oh, I'm sorry.

01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:57.320
Shimagami Tensei Devil Survivor Overclocked for the 3DS. Although I thought that was coming out

01:04:57.320 --> 01:05:04.840
the week after next, but whatever. All right. Well, it sounds like an exciting week in the US.

01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:09.560
Let's move to Japan and see how exciting it is over there and their releases. Uh, pretty much

01:05:09.560 --> 01:05:15.480
the same story, except they don't even have Deus Ex. They get Dirt 3, uh, this week in Japan on

01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:19.800
August the 25th. That's coming out on the Xbox 360. I'm sure we're going to start to see those

01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:25.480
Xbox 360 releases get scaled back quite a bit. Uh, on the PlayStation 3 though, they have Dirt 3

01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:31.720
as well. I guess this, this is probably the big game. Monster Hunter Portable 3rd HD version

01:05:31.720 --> 01:05:36.440
coming out on the PlayStation 3. Wasn't this, this whole PSP game getting remade for the PS3?

01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:40.840
Yes. Yes. That is finally hitting the shelves this week. I have a friend who's so psychotic

01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:44.920
about that game. I was going to say that that's probably the big thing people are excited about

01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:50.680
this week in Japan. Uh, but some people might also be into the Koei games and Sengoku Musou

01:05:50.680 --> 01:05:56.600
3 Empires is coming out this week as well. So if you are into that empire, what, this is just

01:05:56.600 --> 01:06:02.760
Dynasty Warriors, but the, uh, Samurai Warriors. But this is the, this is the spinoff, uh, that

01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:09.320
has more strategic elements, right? Yeah, Empires 3. I think it's, well, Sengoku. I think it's

01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:16.520
Samurai Warriors 3. Uh, alrighty. Uh, Empires. No, that would be Romance of the Three Kingdoms.

01:06:16.520 --> 01:06:23.400
Oh, maybe it is. Yeah. Uh, that's really it on the PlayStation 3, but I will mention on the

01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:29.960
Sony PSP, there's Black Rock Shooter. The game is out this week on the PSP. Uh, there's lots of,

01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:34.440
uh, like special additions. One of them comes with this cute little figurine, a little anime,

01:06:34.440 --> 01:06:39.880
uh, character dressed in white there. Uh, I kind of like that. It looks like a vinylmation figure

01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:43.480
and the game itself. I don't know. I'm looking, just looking at the screenshots. I don't know.

01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:47.960
It's kind of like Sin and Punishment slash RPG-ish to me. So that's that. Black Rock Shooter on the

01:06:47.960 --> 01:06:54.520
Sony PSP, as well as Mobile Suit Gundam Shin Giren no Yabu, because it's just not a Japanese month

01:06:54.520 --> 01:07:00.200
without a new Gundam game. And I believe that is pretty much it for releases. I'm trying to look

01:07:00.200 --> 01:07:05.960
at the, uh, 3DS real quick to see if there's anything of note there. Uh, not this week.

01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:12.120
So shall we go to Europe? Yep. On the 23rd, we have Call of Dirty Black Ops Resurrection on

01:07:12.120 --> 01:07:17.480
Xbox 360. And on the 24th, Hamilton's Great Adventure, Street Fighter III Third Strike,

01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:24.760
Tropico IV. Oh, that's, um, and then on the 26th, which is Friday, there's Pac-Man and

01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:31.560
Galaga Dimensions, Rugby World Cup 2011, and Deus Ex Human Revolution. Yay!

01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:38.440
Sweet. All right. Let's, uh, get a couple more stories in before we get to the classic game of

01:07:38.440 --> 01:07:45.400
the week. Loki. Uh, yes. Um, we talked about the new PSP that's coming to Europe that has Wi-Fi

01:07:45.400 --> 01:07:51.400
removed. Well, Nintendo not to be outdone by Sony. They're removing some other stuff in the

01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:59.880
brand new Wii that is coming out in the UK regions as well. Um, the value Wii for that region, uh,

01:07:59.880 --> 01:08:03.960
will be coming out. Uh, they haven't really given a price yet. It's supposed to be cheaper.

01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:12.680
Um, it is designed to sit horizontally instead of vertically. And, uh, apparently the GameCube

01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:19.880
backwards compatibility, both accessories and games, has been removed. And I guess it'll be

01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:25.640
sometime- do out- What a great feature. Do some- do out sometime before Christmas. Uh, it's gonna

01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:30.680
include, I guess, a Wii Remote Plus, Nunchuck, Wii Party, and Wii Sports. Wii Party. Wow, that-

01:08:30.680 --> 01:08:34.280
that's a throwaway game. They must have had a bunch of extra copies of that. Um,

01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:43.480
yeah, fun times. Well, let's be real, though. How many people are still emulating GameCube games?

01:08:43.480 --> 01:08:48.040
I can think of- and I know as the minute I said that, the chat room's gonna light up with this.

01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:52.760
I can think of one that I play, and that's F0. That's it. All right. And they really just need

01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:57.320
to give that a proper wheelies. Fair enough, but here's gonna be the argument, and I'm sure a lot

01:08:57.320 --> 01:09:02.280
of people in chat are gonna make this. A lot of games, they have the support for playing with a

01:09:02.280 --> 01:09:07.240
GameCube controller. Like, for example, Smash Brothers, or Mario Kart, and that kind of stuff.

01:09:07.240 --> 01:09:12.280
And a lot of people prefer the GameCube controller, or Wavebird, or whatever, to the Wii

01:09:12.280 --> 01:09:17.080
Remote, you know, steering, and that kind of bullshit that they have. Um, so that's what a lot

01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:20.600
of people are probably pissed off about, because they don't want to use the classic controller.

01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:24.680
I'll give you that. But, I mean, cutting those ports out of the system probably did-

01:09:24.680 --> 01:09:28.680
All they would have to do, all they would have to do is create some sort of Wavebird thing that

01:09:28.680 --> 01:09:35.480
plugs, you know, into either wirelessly, or tethered to, you know, the Wii Remote. And boom,

01:09:35.480 --> 01:09:39.960
everyone's happy. But the audience that needs something like that is probably not the same

01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:43.800
audience that this console's geared at. I mean, this is really about getting the Wiis into homes

01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:48.760
that don't already have them, which aren't a lot by now, right? And this is only coming out in

01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:53.720
Europe again. It's not, at least they say it's not coming out here. I still say PAX next week

01:09:53.720 --> 01:09:57.880
could change a lot of things, but I'll go with it and say that it's only probably coming out in

01:09:57.880 --> 01:10:05.560
Europe right now. Yeah. As of right now. So. But yeah, I mean, the GameCube compatibility thing

01:10:05.560 --> 01:10:10.120
probably isn't too surprising. Do you think that maybe, you know, since we talked earlier in the

01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:14.120
show about hacking and stuff, that they've tried to take measures to combat all that?

01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:23.560
Um, no. But here's something interesting, though. They're basically seeing other bundles

01:10:23.560 --> 01:10:32.120
will also be forthcoming. And they also got word that the Nintendo will focus on the new Wii

01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:35.720
bundles going forward, suggesting it won't coexist with the current model.

01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:42.360
So they're going to be removing it out of all of the systems. Hmm. Going forward.

01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:47.400
Tiger Claw in our chat says a chat that orange on Twitter dot com live on this Sunday night.

01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:51.160
Take a look at that precious Wii and pray it never craps out if it's your only system for

01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:55.160
GameCube's games. Otherwise you're screwed unless you actually own the original GameCube.

01:10:55.160 --> 01:11:00.280
Don't be surprised if Nintendo rereleases GameCube games on the Wii with Wiimote support and better

01:11:00.280 --> 01:11:05.720
graphics. They already did. And they didn't even make better graphics. They just put Wii,

01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:09.640
you know, controls in there. Remember new play control stuff that didn't sell very well. That's

01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:13.240
why you don't see him anymore. I'm going to go a step further and say when the Wii U virtual

01:11:13.240 --> 01:11:17.560
console stuff hits, you're probably going to start seeing some of the GameCube stuff pop up on there.

01:11:17.560 --> 01:11:22.120
And then maybe that's why they're starting to try and phase GameCube accessibility out. But

01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:25.480
Breakman has a really good point in chat room. And I kind of agree with this. The original GameCube

01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:29.240
is one of the sturdiest systems. Yeah. Those game, those GameCubes are kind of hard to break.

01:11:29.240 --> 01:11:33.560
I don't, I didn't know anybody that ever had a broken GameCube. Ours has been dropped a couple

01:11:33.560 --> 01:11:38.920
of times and it's lived. Yeah. I mean, the game, the GameCube was a pretty rock solid system.

01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:45.880
Then again, I've also dropped, you know, Super Nintendo off of a, you know, a large drop and

01:11:45.880 --> 01:11:54.120
it lived takes not so much. So anyhow. All right. Well, uh, there you go. I guess a new Wii for the

01:11:54.120 --> 01:12:00.040
three people that don't have one yet. Meanwhile, who knows of a game called steel battalion?

01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:06.120
I do tell the listeners what steel battalion is. If they've ever heard of it. It's a huge war sim

01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:09.960
where you're a Mecca and it had like this huge mungus controller of which we have two now.

01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:15.560
Um, and when the controller came out, it was like 300 bucks. It was expensive because the

01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:21.160
controller was literally a giant, it was a console panels and switches and the red button. It was

01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:26.280
like what you would see inside an actual Mac. It was pretty crazy. It was, it was crazy go nuts.

01:12:26.280 --> 01:12:33.400
Well, there is a new steel battalion game coming out called heavy armor. It's a connect based game.

01:12:33.400 --> 01:12:37.480
So I don't think they're going to be having that huge console anymore. Cause I guess they can do

01:12:37.480 --> 01:12:42.360
this all through connect. Uh, a new trailer was announced or a new trailer was shown this week,

01:12:42.360 --> 01:12:47.800
along with a little fact sheet. Um, apparently you will be able to use connect and the standard

01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:52.280
X-Box three 60 controller. The controller will be used for movement, aiming and firing,

01:12:52.280 --> 01:12:57.320
but the connect camera will use upper body gestures that you can use to start the engine,

01:12:57.320 --> 01:13:02.440
use a turret gun, use the scope. You can communicate verbally with the crew members.

01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:10.520
If you want as well. They talk specifically in the release about high fives. So it sounds like

01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:17.560
they're bringing all these buttons and things that do stuff into a whole new realm, which sounds

01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:22.920
funny to me. I don't know. I think it's going to be fun, but honestly the fun I think of the

01:13:22.920 --> 01:13:27.800
original was you had all the buttons and all the neat little stuff to push. My favorite was the

01:13:27.800 --> 01:13:32.840
eject button. I like to just push that button for fun. But it was the fact that you, it was

01:13:33.400 --> 01:13:39.320
instead of, you know, moving your hand or doing something, you got to push the damn button.

01:13:39.320 --> 01:13:45.160
You know, wasn't that the fun of it that you had the whole console there. That's true. I do like

01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:49.320
to push buttons. You know, they need to release a peripheral for the connect. That's just a,

01:13:49.320 --> 01:13:52.280
a board with buttons on it that I can push. Bubble wrap the game.

01:13:52.280 --> 01:13:58.040
Oh, wait, wait, wait. I don't need buttons anymore. Cause I have the connect and that's,

01:13:58.040 --> 01:14:04.520
that's what it's all about. I like my buttons. I like the buttons. I want to push the red one.

01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:11.480
All right, let's get to the classic game of the week. Every week here on the program,

01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:15.800
dark soccer dives into the gaming vault and says, Hey, back in my day, we pushed a lot of buttons

01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:20.040
and you're going to be pushing my buttons. If you don't try this game, it's the classic game

01:14:20.040 --> 01:14:23.480
of the week. Dark soccer. Excuse me. What'd you pick as the classic game of the week?

01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:27.960
The classic game of the week is midnight resistance. Woo. And we can all thank Dan

01:14:27.960 --> 01:14:33.800
for this. Cause I was like, Dan, help me think of a game. Uh, midnight resistance. Okay. So it is

01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:39.560
a side scrolling action shooting game that data East put out in the arcade in 1989 and came out

01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:47.640
on the mega drive. Also known as the Genesis in 1990, it was put up by ocean software in us.

01:14:47.640 --> 01:14:54.280
Yes. It is in the future where everything sucks. And you're a member of resistance, uh,

01:14:55.000 --> 01:15:02.280
movement dude who, uh, has to rescue his family from a mad scientist before he turns them into

01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:07.880
donkeys or something. Not really. Anyway, basically it's Contra, but not, yeah, it's

01:15:07.880 --> 01:15:16.120
Contra, but not. And you could do two players simultaneous. Nontra. Okay. That's what Loki said

01:15:16.120 --> 01:15:23.160
without talking into his mic. Um, but anyway, it had a rotatable joystick. That's like the one used

01:15:23.160 --> 01:15:29.080
in Ikari warriors, which is why this is a hard game to emulate unless you've got an arcade

01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:36.840
controller. Um, at any rate, you also had your shoots and jumps and your, uh, you know, you

01:15:36.840 --> 01:15:45.080
would use your little dial to adjust your aim as you went along. Um, so, uh, you could keep moving

01:15:45.080 --> 01:15:50.040
in direction, but change your aim. It was pretty neat. And it had a power up system that was like

01:15:50.040 --> 01:15:55.720
an, uh, heavy barrel, which was also a data East game where you would collect keys, um, after

01:15:55.720 --> 01:16:01.080
defeating enemies and like you get six keys at a time, and then you can enter a weapon storage

01:16:01.080 --> 01:16:06.360
and pick out different weapons and power ups and stuff. Um, your main weapons that you could get

01:16:06.360 --> 01:16:14.440
were, uh, you, you could replace your default rifle with, um, backpack weapons that are launched.

01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:19.960
So you'd actually push the joystick and press the shoot button to do it at the same time. Um, you

01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:24.760
knew different special guns. You had a supercharged upgrade that would increase your firepower

01:16:24.760 --> 01:16:29.800
and a barrier that gives you invincibility temporarily and extra lives. There's nine

01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:36.520
stages with different obstacles. And right before the final stages, you, um, use your keys. Um,

01:16:36.520 --> 01:16:42.440
but you'd have to battle the Crimson King. And the ending depends on how many of your family

01:16:42.440 --> 01:16:50.120
members you rescued. Uh, when it came out for home, uh, like I said, it was published by, uh,

01:16:50.120 --> 01:16:57.240
Data East, um, for, uh, the Mega Drive in Japan. And it's very close to the arcade version, except

01:16:57.240 --> 01:17:01.480
of course the controllers, since, you know, it's just a Genesis pad, you couldn't have the rotatable

01:17:01.480 --> 01:17:06.760
things. So you had four different, uh, button configurations. Um, your default controllers will

01:17:06.760 --> 01:17:15.800
let you, um, move with the, the D-pad and hold your own steady by holding B. And then, um, you'd

01:17:15.800 --> 01:17:20.600
actually would just heal keep moving. It's, and it was only one player, two on top of that. Uh,

01:17:20.600 --> 01:17:25.320
further versions that came out, there was, um, and this was, like I said, by Ocean Software,

01:17:25.320 --> 01:17:31.480
the Commodore 64. Fuck yes. I had a feeling that you were familiar with this game. How in the fuck

01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:36.040
you did this game on the Commodore 64? I have no idea. I've got, can I look up a YouTube of that?

01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:41.560
I got to see this on the 64. There's the ZX Spectrum, the Amstrad CPC, Commodore Amiga,

01:17:41.560 --> 01:17:49.000
and the Atari ST. Um, some development done by Special FX. And actually one thing, um,

01:17:49.640 --> 01:17:55.720
Rob, is that this is, uh, listed as one of the greatest games ever made for that system.

01:17:57.880 --> 01:18:02.440
Actually, this doesn't look too terrible. I mean, for a Commodore 64 game and I caught, I love,

01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:06.120
love, love the Commodore 64 music. Listen to the music on the C64.

01:18:08.280 --> 01:18:10.440
Oh, of course now it changed. Hold on, let me go back a little bit.

01:18:14.840 --> 01:18:16.680
Go back and play the, um, previous one.

01:18:19.080 --> 01:18:23.240
Oh, the actual music? Yeah, just to compare. Sure, sure. Let me, uh, jump in here.

01:18:27.240 --> 01:18:30.840
So you see, it's, it's, I think pretty playful. Yeah, yeah.

01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:36.200
Um, oh, for the Spectrum, by the way, it was completely redesigned and done really cartoony.

01:18:37.080 --> 01:18:44.440
And, uh, it had a push screen scrolling and very few colors, but it's considered to be one of the

01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:49.960
best games on the system. And that's it. That's Midnight Resistance. All right. There it is,

01:18:49.960 --> 01:18:55.640
your classic game of the week, Midnight Resistance for the, what system specifically? Arcade? I'm

01:18:55.640 --> 01:18:59.800
talking about arcade, but we'll also include the home releases. All right. So the arcade slash

01:18:59.800 --> 01:19:05.400
Mega Drive slash C64 slash other stuff, a bunch of British systems. All right. There you go. Uh,

01:19:05.400 --> 01:19:09.880
your classic game of the week. Good pick. I, I've actually not heard of that game, but it looks kind

01:19:09.880 --> 01:19:14.680
of interesting. So, and here I thought I knew every game that was on the Commodore 64. That's

01:19:14.680 --> 01:19:18.520
what I thought that you would be very interested because I mean, it's lauded as one of the best

01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:23.800
games for the Commodore 64. Well, every fucking game that was released in the eighties and the

01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:28.360
arcades came out on the Commodore 64 at some point, but there was, there was a lot of games

01:19:28.360 --> 01:19:32.600
on Commodore 64. I'm telling you. All right. Uh, we're gonna take a quick break guys, but we'll be

01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:36.600
back with more of Orange Lounge Radio after this. Stay tuned. Of course, we've got more information

01:19:36.600 --> 01:19:41.080
on VidRhythm, Harmonix's next project we're gonna talk about in the next segment, uh, as well as

01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:46.040
Diablo 3 and some of the rumors with that. And then of course your calls, your tweets,

01:19:46.040 --> 01:19:49.320
and much more when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:19:49.320 --> 01:20:00.280
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio. We are live on this Sunday evening,

01:20:00.280 --> 01:20:07.000
August the 21st of 2011 with episode number 425 of our show. And unfortunately I can't play it

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:11.960
during the podcast because it's a licensed music, but the live folks got to hear a little song from

01:20:11.960 --> 01:20:17.400
Luminous back in the, uh, PSP days. And that first came out. One of its strongest launch titles was

01:20:17.400 --> 01:20:22.520
the puzzler game Luminous and we played the song Shinin, uh, from that game. And very excited to

01:20:22.520 --> 01:20:27.720
hear that, uh, apparently Luminous is going to be getting a version on the PlayStation Vita as well.

01:20:27.720 --> 01:20:32.520
I sort of thought that franchise was kind of done for after the 360 and PlayStation 3 ones,

01:20:32.520 --> 01:20:36.760
but it sounds like maybe not. So I don't know about you guys, but I think that's pretty awesome.

01:20:36.760 --> 01:20:40.440
I don't know what else they'll be able to kind of do with the franchise. I mean,

01:20:40.440 --> 01:20:47.000
but you never know. I liked Luminous 2 a lot. A lot of people didn't care for it, but I loved it.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:52.200
Um, because it had a lot of the licensed music and that's exactly why a lot of people didn't like it,

01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:55.800
but I thought it was cool. Like, I'm sorry. I thought Hollaback Girl was kind of funny

01:20:55.800 --> 01:21:03.160
to play in Luminous. I really liked, uh, well, I had a Missy Elliott song and a Beck song and

01:21:03.160 --> 01:21:08.120
the first one we start. I really, my favorite though is still the first one. Yeah. Like I can,

01:21:08.120 --> 01:21:12.680
you know, that's fair, but it's probably better. Both of them are probably better than the Xbox one

01:21:12.680 --> 01:21:19.880
in my opinion. It's just the controller on the Xbox too is so, it's rough. Still surprised to

01:21:19.880 --> 01:21:25.080
this day. They have never tried to really correct the Xbox 360 D pad in this country anyway.

01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:29.640
Other than selling it as a premium monochrome controller that, you know, wasn't that only

01:21:29.640 --> 01:21:33.720
available in Europe or in butt green? Really? It wasn't really. They still sell it today.

01:21:33.720 --> 01:21:38.520
Really? It's more expensive than the regular controller. Of course. Of course. All right,

01:21:38.520 --> 01:21:43.080
well, let's get into some rapid fire news. Some quick, quick news stories for you guys

01:21:43.080 --> 01:21:49.160
and we're going to cover quite a bit here. Loki. Hey, guess what? Nintendo announced the launch

01:21:49.160 --> 01:21:56.600
of their largest title for the Wii, um, maybe even to date. Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword will

01:21:56.600 --> 01:22:01.800
be out in North America November 20th. So you can mark that down. I guess that is holiday.

01:22:01.800 --> 01:22:06.680
And of course it will require motion plus, which, you know, God, by now you probably have

01:22:06.680 --> 01:22:10.760
something that's motion plus. Actually, I still don't have a motion plus. Is that sad? Well,

01:22:10.760 --> 01:22:16.120
you aren't going to play the game then. Go buy Wii Party Motion or something like that.

01:22:16.120 --> 01:22:25.880
Get free crappy game with Thermo. This is kind of cool. There's some portal turrets coming to

01:22:25.880 --> 01:22:34.920
Bastion on Steam. Really? Yes. Apparently they've got some cool stuff. There's a quest

01:22:34.920 --> 01:22:39.720
exclusive for the Steam version of Bastion where the kid uses a gel canister marked with the

01:22:39.720 --> 01:22:48.600
Aperture Science logo that contains a vicious substance of unknown origin. And if, um, you use

01:22:48.600 --> 01:22:55.240
that, uh, friendly portal turrets, uh, will come into battle and they will shoot enemies for you.

01:22:55.240 --> 01:22:58.680
Bobby actually sent me a YouTube of this earlier in the night. So, um, let me,

01:22:58.680 --> 01:23:01.640
I don't know if this is going to have narration in it. Let me try to play this YouTube.

01:23:01.640 --> 01:23:10.920
But who are we to judge? That's the narrator. So let's see. Not every squirt's born bad.

01:23:10.920 --> 01:23:18.440
Some spring to the kid's defense. Judging by the mood of the cage, it's going to take a little

01:23:18.440 --> 01:23:24.520
while. Oh yeah, there's the turrets. Are they talking? Yeah.

01:23:24.520 --> 01:23:33.560
That's fantastic. Yeah, that's not in the 360 version.

01:23:36.920 --> 01:23:38.440
Oh yeah, they're talking. That's cool.

01:23:38.440 --> 01:23:43.160
Scumbags don't take.

01:23:51.880 --> 01:23:54.280
Now they're all over on this screen. That's pretty cool.

01:23:58.360 --> 01:24:00.920
Uh, I think they're kind of attaching different parts of the game together.

01:24:02.440 --> 01:24:06.200
The music's great in this game. I like this game. It's part of the reason I'm

01:24:06.200 --> 01:24:09.560
pissed my Xbox guy hacked. So I'd like to be playing this right now. It's pretty cool.

01:24:14.440 --> 01:24:14.920
There you go.

01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:23.160
Clip from Bastion plus portal. So yeah, um, you can check it out if you download the game.

01:24:23.800 --> 01:24:31.560
And then, um, of course, one of the things that people want to see when a 3d console comes out is

01:24:31.560 --> 01:24:38.920
boobs. Where are we talking about this just last week? Starting, I was talking about 3d websites

01:24:38.920 --> 01:24:43.400
and how they need websites with boobs is like, I remember talking about this and Bobby said he

01:24:43.400 --> 01:24:47.560
was going to go make the website. Even it was like 3d boobies.com or something. I remember

01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:52.680
what we called it. I swear this came up like last week on the show. Well, apparently, uh,

01:24:52.680 --> 01:25:02.840
the half minute hero designer, uh, Kenny Chiro, uh, Takaki, um, he is set out to create a 3ds game,

01:25:02.840 --> 01:25:09.000
uh, based on, I guess, uh, I don't know if it's an anime or whatever, but anyways, it's called

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:18.200
Senran, uh, Kaguru or Kuruura. I'm sorry. And it's basically female ninjas with giant breasts.

01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:24.600
And, uh, the game will be on sale in Japan, September 22nd. Don't plan on seeing that coming

01:25:24.600 --> 01:25:32.280
out over here, but, uh, yeah. Uh, they've got a trailer for it. It's, um, it doesn't really show

01:25:32.280 --> 01:25:39.720
too much. I mean, it's just kind of this anime intro thing. And then, um, you know, lots of

01:25:39.720 --> 01:25:47.080
innuendo, like all of them sucking on stuff right now and, and large boobs. And she's pulling out

01:25:47.080 --> 01:25:55.560
boobs and she's pulling out stuff from her boobs and yeah. Lots of breasts. Oh, and panty shot.

01:25:58.440 --> 01:26:02.440
You say this like it's a bad thing. I mean, this is really what people want a 3ds for, right?

01:26:02.440 --> 01:26:09.400
It's, I think it's welcomed. All right. Let's move on to some other news. This has to do with

01:26:09.400 --> 01:26:13.880
a game coming to PlayStation network. It's a revival of an old arcade game. Elevator

01:26:13.880 --> 01:26:20.040
action deluxe. Yes. Uh, apparently, uh, there's a new PlayStation network version. It's an HD

01:26:20.040 --> 01:26:24.280
update of the old game. Uh, you know, I don't know if you've ever played this game. If you have,

01:26:24.280 --> 01:26:27.320
you know, the original elevator deluxe, look up some of the clips on YouTube. I know it was on

01:26:27.320 --> 01:26:31.640
the NES. It was very popular back in the day. So I'm sure you guys probably will recognize this

01:26:31.640 --> 01:26:35.240
when you see some YouTube's of it. Uh, but the new version on PlayStation network, of course,

01:26:35.240 --> 01:26:40.680
not just an HD, you know, upgrade and so forth, but there's going to be new, new weapons, um,

01:26:40.680 --> 01:26:46.520
faster elevators, uh, multiplayer modes that are available offline, including deathmatch

01:26:46.520 --> 01:26:51.480
and other competitive modes. So that'll be kind of neat, I guess, $10 for that. I don't know. I

01:26:51.480 --> 01:26:54.440
always kind of thought elevator action was overrated. I did not think it was that great

01:26:54.440 --> 01:27:00.600
of a game as far as like classic games go. I think it's one of the, uh, ones that's blown way

01:27:00.600 --> 01:27:04.200
out of proportion, but whatever. I know some people are really into it. So will they pay $10

01:27:04.200 --> 01:27:09.640
to revisit it? Who knows? Rockband is going to be adding some stuff from the red hot chili peppers,

01:27:09.640 --> 01:27:15.160
and that is all coming on August 30th. Uh, I guess the, the pack is called the I'm with the

01:27:15.160 --> 01:27:19.960
chili peppers pack because the new album is called I'm with you. Uh, some of the songs that are in

01:27:19.960 --> 01:27:25.000
this pack. Well, why not? I'll just do all the songs, by the way, Californication, uh,

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:30.920
look around monarchy of roses, other side, parallel universe, scar tissue, and the adventures

01:27:30.920 --> 01:27:37.160
of rain dance Maggie. Uh, of course the usual rock band pricing of dollar 99 on the Xbox 360

01:27:37.160 --> 01:27:41.400
or PlayStation three, August 30th, as soon as come out, keep in mind, if the red hot chili pepper

01:27:41.400 --> 01:27:46.360
song you were hoping for wasn't in that list, there's already quite a few in the main game. So,

01:27:46.360 --> 01:27:53.640
uh, you'd better check the master song lists on the Xbox three sixties, uh, the S models.

01:27:53.640 --> 01:27:57.240
If you don't have one of these yet, but you're thinking about getting one in the near future,

01:27:57.240 --> 01:28:01.480
they're going to be changing the finish. Like for instance, Loki happens to have one here in

01:28:01.480 --> 01:28:04.760
the studio, so I can see that it's got a very glossy look to it. You know, you can kind of

01:28:04.760 --> 01:28:09.960
see my own reflection in it that is going away. There's going to be, what's called a matte black

01:28:09.960 --> 01:28:14.680
will be, uh, apparently the matte black ones are the four gig systems now, but they're going to be

01:28:14.680 --> 01:28:20.520
for all of them soon. So probably a cost saving thing, whatever. I don't think most of these sit

01:28:20.520 --> 01:28:24.200
inside your shelves anywhere where you can't even see the matte blacks probably better. Anyway,

01:28:24.200 --> 01:28:28.360
something picks up fingerprints, like yeah, probably won't stick, stick the fingerprints

01:28:28.360 --> 01:28:32.360
as well and all that. So whatever, uh, those will be making their way to retailers over the coming

01:28:32.360 --> 01:28:35.400
weeks. And certainly if you're getting one of these for the holiday, you'll probably have one

01:28:35.400 --> 01:28:39.480
of those with the matte finish. All right. Uh, Dark Soccer, what do you have for us?

01:28:39.480 --> 01:28:46.440
Stuff. Mega Man X2 actually has been given an ESRB rating for the Wii. So meaning that we

01:28:46.440 --> 01:28:51.880
should have it on the virtual console at some point and it's E for everyone. Aww. You know,

01:28:51.880 --> 01:28:59.000
that's the one that has the Shoryuken in it, right? And, um, for 3DS, Tekken 3D Prime Edition

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:06.440
is actually going to come with, uh, apparently it's going to come with Blood Vengeance,

01:29:06.440 --> 01:29:13.800
which is, uh, that movie. It's going to be, uh, included, um, on the cartridge. So that sounds

01:29:13.800 --> 01:29:17.960
like it'll be cool. So you're actually going to be watching something and it's part of the PS3

01:29:17.960 --> 01:29:23.000
bundle for the record, which I really want to see it. And then last but not least, Little Big Planet

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:29.000
2 Move Pack. Here's what's going to be in it. It has a brand new story for Little Big Planet 2

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:33.800
called The Rise of the Cakling. Five levels, seven minigames, two cutscenes, a new powerup for

01:29:33.800 --> 01:29:38.840
Sackboy called the Brain Crane, three move gadgets, the movinator, the move recorder, and the paint

01:29:38.840 --> 01:29:44.680
tool, four interactive music tracks, eight music sequencer tracks, a new sound object containing

01:29:44.680 --> 01:29:51.240
32 new sounds, 17 new music sequencer instruments, a new level background, six new costumes,

01:29:51.240 --> 01:29:57.400
18 materials, 41 decorations, 31 objects, 66 stickers, 39 new Little Big Planet pins,

01:29:57.400 --> 01:30:01.000
11 brand new PlayStation trophies, and a partridge in a pear tree. No price yet,

01:30:01.640 --> 01:30:07.160
but it will be out on September 14th. I still need to buy Little Big Planet 2. Isn't that sad?

01:30:07.160 --> 01:30:12.120
I think I'm going to keep waiting. I keep holding out for like a price reduction. Like

01:30:12.120 --> 01:30:16.440
Loki, you do the retail thing. Do you think there'll be like a one that has the move crap

01:30:16.440 --> 01:30:20.600
bundled in with it for like a cheaper price? They'll do probably, well, they did with the

01:30:20.600 --> 01:30:23.240
first one, a game of the year edition. Yes, that's what I'm waiting for.

01:30:25.080 --> 01:30:27.240
I don't think that's going to happen this year though, because

01:30:28.280 --> 01:30:35.480
it's, last one came a year after the first one came out and I believe, what's the Little Big

01:30:35.480 --> 01:30:40.760
Planet 2, was that this year? That was January, I think. What's that last year? It was, I think

01:30:40.760 --> 01:30:47.320
it had been pushed to this year. It was this year. Early this year. So yeah, I don't think

01:30:47.320 --> 01:30:52.120
that we're going to see that any cheaper. I mean, it may price drop a little bit, but

01:30:54.120 --> 01:30:57.960
it'll be a while. All right, fine.

01:30:57.960 --> 01:31:01.320
Probably when they have some more content packs for it.

01:31:01.320 --> 01:31:05.880
Fine. All right. Well, let's move on. We're going to get back into some longer news and

01:31:05.880 --> 01:31:10.600
pretty soon the Skype line. But first I want to make sure I get at least one more plug in,

01:31:10.600 --> 01:31:13.960
because we might be starting this segment when we get back. It depends if I can get this

01:31:13.960 --> 01:31:18.120
particular people on the show or not. But we are, again, trying very hard to feature

01:31:18.120 --> 01:31:22.920
indie games on the show and are hoping to begin that around the Labor Day show, which will be,

01:31:22.920 --> 01:31:27.960
of course, the show when we get back. If you are an indie developer yourself or you know someone

01:31:27.960 --> 01:31:32.280
who's an indie developer who needs help getting the word out on the game and you think the game

01:31:32.280 --> 01:31:37.080
is unique and special and needs a little help standing out in the Xbox Live Marketplace,

01:31:37.080 --> 01:31:42.600
since Microsoft won't help you, we will. Or even if it's an iOS game or a PC game or wherever it is,

01:31:42.600 --> 01:31:47.240
drop me an email, Rob at OrangeLaunchRadio.com. That's me personally. Or you can always email

01:31:47.240 --> 01:31:53.560
the show if you'd rather. Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com and we will try to get to your

01:31:53.560 --> 01:32:01.080
game to feature it as an indie game on the show. And even if we don't get a lot of bite on that,

01:32:01.080 --> 01:32:06.040
we're probably just going to start the spotlights very soon. So look forward to that. All right.

01:32:06.040 --> 01:32:11.080
Meanwhile, let's get into some longer news. Oh, other plugs. I forgot to plug the other stuff.

01:32:11.080 --> 01:32:14.520
I already plugged Girls Gone Wow at the top of the show. I'm on it this week.

01:32:14.520 --> 01:32:17.960
If you do like Warcraft and like one show is not enough for you this week,

01:32:17.960 --> 01:32:22.760
please check out Horde House. HordeHouse.com, the best little Horde House in Azeroth. That's a show

01:32:22.760 --> 01:32:28.280
that my buddy Extfer and I do about Warcraft every week. Dark Sakura will be back with the

01:32:28.280 --> 01:32:33.560
second podcast hopefully very soon. Something I'm joining her with. Yes. Again, Labor Day-ish

01:32:33.560 --> 01:32:38.360
once all this stuff settles because there's a lot going on personal life for Jamie and Dan

01:32:38.360 --> 01:32:42.600
right now. So real life is intruding violently. We had to delay it a little bit, but it's still

01:32:42.600 --> 01:32:46.840
on the radar. So sorry. We keep announcing. We've been announcing that for like six weeks now, but

01:32:46.840 --> 01:32:50.920
things happen. But we've got like show roles and everything and stuff ready. I know. I know. We're,

01:32:50.920 --> 01:32:54.280
we, we know what we're doing. We're ready to go. It's just a matter of doing it. So,

01:32:54.840 --> 01:32:57.720
all right. Let's move on. Let's get into some longer news. Loki.

01:32:58.760 --> 01:33:04.280
This is kind of creepy and interesting at the same time. I guess GameStop has been testing

01:33:04.280 --> 01:33:10.360
a console streaming service. Right now, they're hoping to have a beta in place by the end of this

01:33:10.360 --> 01:33:17.400
year. And right now, I mean, this should be a huge surprise because they bought a company called

01:33:17.400 --> 01:33:25.320
Spawn Labs, which they had their own game streaming box. Basically, this would stream

01:33:25.320 --> 01:33:31.880
console games. So Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 games to smart devices and dedicated hardware.

01:33:31.880 --> 01:33:39.000
And they're also tinkering with PC game streaming as well. I don't know. That's kind of creepy.

01:33:40.840 --> 01:33:47.160
I guess there'll be a, this will be a service for people that are, you know, GameStop power up

01:33:47.160 --> 01:33:53.080
rewards members and that demos will be provided. And of course, the rest of the stuff, including

01:33:53.080 --> 01:33:59.160
pricing, is not known. And it's, they're expected to have a full rollout by early next year. And,

01:33:59.160 --> 01:34:04.600
um, or more, I guess more details about early next year and full rollout by middle of 2012.

01:34:06.520 --> 01:34:11.480
It's interesting. Eh, I don't care because it's GameStop and I already told you my feelings on

01:34:11.480 --> 01:34:14.680
them a few weeks ago. And if you missed that whole little rant, I am boycotting them because

01:34:14.680 --> 01:34:20.440
I think they're a shitty company. So I kind of don't care about this whole thing. However,

01:34:20.440 --> 01:34:23.560
I will say, let me, let me think of something nice I could say about this.

01:34:23.560 --> 01:34:30.440
Competition is healthy. And so these sort, these, uh, places like OnLive and so forth that are

01:34:30.440 --> 01:34:34.600
already offering something very similar, right? Uh, the competition is a healthy thing.

01:34:35.640 --> 01:34:41.480
Uh, this is GameStop you're talking about. This is the monkey that's in, you know, the corner,

01:34:41.480 --> 01:34:45.960
basically the elephant in the room there. They're the biggest monkey in the corner throwing poo at

01:34:45.960 --> 01:34:51.320
itself. Yes, whatever. They're the biggest retailer for video games out there in the

01:34:51.320 --> 01:34:57.400
marketplace right now. They dictate to publishers what they do. Um, so I don't know if it's a

01:34:57.400 --> 01:35:01.640
comfortable thing to have them in this game streaming marketplace. Cause what you're going

01:35:01.640 --> 01:35:05.880
to get then is, Oh, this game's gonna be exclusive to our service. This game's gonna be exclusive to

01:35:05.880 --> 01:35:09.560
our service, you know, and so on and so forth. You're gonna get into that kind of crap because

01:35:09.560 --> 01:35:13.080
they're like, well, we're not going to sell your game in store if you don't put it on our service.

01:35:14.360 --> 01:35:18.040
That's what's going to be coming. So all those gonna be disgusting.

01:35:18.040 --> 01:35:23.000
And that, that, by the way, that right there, just add that to the list of why I boys, I'm like,

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:26.920
if you are new to OLR and you know, I know we have a lot of people that like work at GameStops

01:35:26.920 --> 01:35:31.400
and stuff like that. My beef is not with the workers. You guys, you guys have a thankless

01:35:31.400 --> 01:35:35.080
job and I respect what you've got to do, what you got to do to pay the bills. My problem is

01:35:35.080 --> 01:35:40.120
with the management of the company. If you need, uh, information about what that all entails,

01:35:40.120 --> 01:35:43.960
look at what Loki just said, because that will probably be reality. Cause that, that's,

01:35:43.960 --> 01:35:49.400
I mean, when it comes down to, you know, dictating, I mean, perfect example, you know,

01:35:49.400 --> 01:35:55.000
there'll be games that come out that are street dated. Earth Defense Force, for example, you know,

01:35:55.000 --> 01:36:03.160
and Earth Defense Force was supposed to come out on Tuesday in July. All right. D3, they fucked up.

01:36:03.160 --> 01:36:08.680
They accidentally printed, you know, a date on the box that didn't coincide with that date that was

01:36:08.680 --> 01:36:14.680
on the actual packaging and what they've been communicated to all the different stores. So,

01:36:14.680 --> 01:36:18.920
whereas a regular store would go, hey, wait a second, you know, this date was wrong. And,

01:36:18.920 --> 01:36:23.240
you know, they would contact D3 and D3 are like, oh yeah, that was a misprint. The street date is

01:36:23.240 --> 01:36:29.320
still, you know, the day we stated GameStop said, hey, you printed a different date on here that

01:36:29.320 --> 01:36:33.320
happens to be earlier. We're going to use that date and you don't want us to put it out. Well,

01:36:33.320 --> 01:36:37.640
fuck you. We're just going to put it out anyways. And even though that information wasn't

01:36:37.640 --> 01:36:41.480
communicated to all the other retailers out there, ah, fuck them. We're GameStop. We're going to put

01:36:41.480 --> 01:36:45.880
it out anyways because you put a date on here and we're hearing to the date that you put on this,

01:36:45.880 --> 01:36:51.000
even though it is a misprint. That's the type of company GameStop is. They will do whatever

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:56.520
cutthroat thing they need to do to be on top. So, if you like all the streaming services like

01:36:56.520 --> 01:37:05.720
OnLive and stuff, well, I hope they survive. Kaijuto in chat says, why all the GameStop hate?

01:37:05.720 --> 01:37:09.080
All they do is sell us games and they've been made buying games easier for people like me who

01:37:09.080 --> 01:37:13.880
don't like to shop online. Remember the 80s and how much Toys R Us and mom and pop shops would

01:37:13.880 --> 01:37:20.520
sell games an arm and a leg, 90 plus dollars. Again, I have to defer back to my earlier rant

01:37:20.520 --> 01:37:25.000
that would have been about three or four weeks ago because I really don't want to get into it again.

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:31.240
But there's plenty of other options, plenty of other options. So, that's all I'm going to say

01:37:31.240 --> 01:37:36.680
about that for now. I don't want to make things easier. I'm sorry. I mean, well, you know that

01:37:36.680 --> 01:37:41.480
there's games sold at that store. You can buy games anywhere nowadays. I understand the allure

01:37:41.480 --> 01:37:47.240
of retail versus buying things online. I mean, that's why, I mean, why hasn't every mall in

01:37:47.240 --> 01:37:51.800
America closed if we can just buy our crap online? Because some people want to go see it. Like,

01:37:51.800 --> 01:37:56.440
clothing stores are never going to be replaced with online clothing stores because let's face

01:37:56.440 --> 01:38:01.240
it, some people need to try it on first, you know. That's just, this is a matter of fact. And with

01:38:01.240 --> 01:38:06.280
game shopping, it's kind of a very similar story. Some people need to try it on first and, you know,

01:38:06.280 --> 01:38:11.560
game kiosks and so forth let you do that. Ask questions which you can't do online and so on

01:38:11.560 --> 01:38:15.640
and so forth. I'm just saying there's plenty of other retail options. GameStop as a company has

01:38:15.640 --> 01:38:21.160
done some things to people I know that I don't like and I'm not going to support them. My choice.

01:38:21.160 --> 01:38:26.760
And you're perfectly justified, I think. I agree.

01:38:26.760 --> 01:38:34.840
Yep. So, let's move on to happier news, shall we? Let's talk about VidRhythm. VidRhythm is

01:38:34.840 --> 01:38:41.000
Harmonix's new video game franchise, music franchise. And a lot of people were saying,

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:44.120
ooh, maybe this will be like when they heard the title because we heard the title because of a

01:38:44.120 --> 01:38:49.080
trademark or application or one of those things before. And a lot of people were hoping, ooh,

01:38:49.080 --> 01:38:53.400
maybe it's like a new frequency or amplitude or something like that, like VidRhythm, like videos

01:38:53.400 --> 01:39:01.160
and stuff. Well, it turns out that the game has been announced for iOS. In a Gamasutra interview

01:39:01.160 --> 01:39:08.520
with Alex Rogopoulos, who's the Harmonix head honcho, he says that it's for the iOS and it's

01:39:08.520 --> 01:39:14.520
more of an app than a game. Quote, we think there are a lot of creative opportunities with

01:39:14.520 --> 01:39:21.000
smartphones that we haven't really been able to focus on yet. So, we're looking forward to doing

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:29.320
more in that space. Hmm. So, it sounds like this may have something to do more so than just a game.

01:39:29.960 --> 01:39:35.080
Maybe it has something to do with location. Maybe it has something to do with pictures or videos

01:39:35.080 --> 01:39:40.760
that the phones can do now. Who knows? It could be interesting. I have no idea. I mean, a statement

01:39:40.760 --> 01:39:44.840
like that could really go anywhere. Like, I don't know if it's just CEO speak blowing smoke up my

01:39:44.840 --> 01:39:50.200
ass that they're doing something new when they're really not. It's just their take on something.

01:39:50.200 --> 01:39:55.880
But then I go, but it's Harmonix. And Harmonix, they kind of have, I mean, Rock Band and keep in

01:39:55.880 --> 01:40:00.840
mind, they made the original Guitar Hero with Red Octane. You know, that really was kind of

01:40:00.840 --> 01:40:05.240
something new. And I know there's going to be the people that are like, but Guitar Freaks,

01:40:05.240 --> 01:40:10.760
Guitar Freaks. Well, I'm sorry. They took the risk of making that more mainstream for America

01:40:10.760 --> 01:40:15.640
that Konami refused to do time and time again. That's why Harmonix succeeded here because they

01:40:15.640 --> 01:40:23.240
did what Konami refused to do. So, Harmonix does what Konami don't. Something like that,

01:40:23.240 --> 01:40:27.320
but let's face it. We're, you know, we're long past that. That, that whole stuff is years old.

01:40:27.320 --> 01:40:35.160
So now it's about what is VidRhythm. So I don't know. I VidRhythm, I don't know. I see in my mind

01:40:35.160 --> 01:40:38.280
that when he talks about, we're trying to do things to smartphones that haven't been done,

01:40:38.280 --> 01:40:43.160
like maybe it has something to do with location or like picture. I don't know why pictures keep

01:40:43.160 --> 01:40:48.920
coming to my mind, but maybe somehow it has to do with pictures on your phone, get incorporated

01:40:48.920 --> 01:40:54.360
into the game. I don't know, but that alone sounds really cheesy. So I don't know. I guess we'll see

01:40:54.360 --> 01:40:59.400
more when the demo is out or what happens with it. Of course, if it's iOS, then it'll be one of

01:40:59.400 --> 01:41:03.000
those things where they'll just be like, oh, it's coming out whenever Apple pushes it to the store,

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:09.400
which could be like tomorrow. So we'll see. All right, let's move on to the mailbag. Every week,

01:41:09.400 --> 01:41:15.240
Dark Sakura dives into the mailbag head first and pulls out some emails that she thinks, hey,

01:41:16.360 --> 01:41:19.640
I should read this on the air. Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

01:41:19.640 --> 01:41:21.400
You want to know what sucks? What?

01:41:21.400 --> 01:41:27.240
Is that, um, the window I had the mailbag open in, um, it was closed. Sorry. Hold on. Let me

01:41:27.240 --> 01:41:31.320
reopen it. You better open that shit real fast. All right. I guess I can plug Twitter again real

01:41:31.320 --> 01:41:35.320
quick at the end of the show. Cause we'll be doing your Twitter topics, twitter.com slash O L R.

01:41:35.880 --> 01:41:40.120
We will be doing the Skype line later. The 800 number is back tonight. Thank you very much.

01:41:40.120 --> 01:41:46.120
So, uh, wait for that. All right, here they are. You ready? No, I want to talk more.

01:41:46.120 --> 01:41:53.000
Um, and by the way, I'm not going to call you person. Hey guys, thanks for the show,

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:56.920
particularly to Rob for posting the podcast to the feed as quick as he's doing.

01:41:56.920 --> 01:42:00.840
It really makes a difference for those of us who are unable to listen live. At the top of the show,

01:42:00.840 --> 01:42:04.920
there was some angst about having mobile games that just aren't optimized for various,

01:42:06.760 --> 01:42:11.800
for the various devices they're available for. I just want to chime in with my two cents and let

01:42:11.800 --> 01:42:15.720
you know that this is one area where Android does it better than iOS because developers can

01:42:15.720 --> 01:42:19.880
actually segment their apps and create install packages for each group of devices they want to

01:42:19.880 --> 01:42:25.800
offer their app for whether by OS version or hardware. So they can assure that that gamers

01:42:25.800 --> 01:42:31.320
get the best experience they can. Best of all, I only purchased the apps once and can install it

01:42:31.320 --> 01:42:35.800
on every device I have fully optimized. Finally, with it being an open platform, there's a bunch

01:42:35.800 --> 01:42:39.800
of great apps for gamers who like me prefer a physical game pad, even going so far as to use a

01:42:39.800 --> 01:42:46.280
wiimote for our games for free. A first person shooter on my zoom with the moat and nunchuck over

01:42:46.280 --> 01:42:51.480
Bluetooth is great for traveling. I am not eagerly awaiting the inevitable update that will bring

01:42:51.480 --> 01:42:56.520
Google plus games to Android tablets and phones. Life will be sweet when that hits. Grats again

01:42:56.520 --> 01:43:01.720
from a plane somewhere over the great horchata filled country of Mexico sent from my zoom.

01:43:02.280 --> 01:43:07.240
Oh my God, I haven't had an horchata in forever. I know a place that's open late that has them so

01:43:07.240 --> 01:43:13.000
good. But from thine eyes, my knowledge I derive, which is a Shakespeare quote. He put it on there.

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:19.880
And that is from, um, I'm going to say Dr. Noir. Did I miss, did I miss a question in there? I

01:43:19.880 --> 01:43:23.480
thought I heard a question about what we were talking about on that top of last week's show

01:43:23.480 --> 01:43:28.360
about the mobile games. Um, or was it just a statement? A statement. Okay, my bad. The

01:43:28.360 --> 01:43:35.400
Android's better. Whatever. I'm glad you think so. Last one, which is the only one. Hey, OLR,

01:43:35.400 --> 01:43:42.440
SonicM88 here with another question for you. Wonderful folks. No. 42. Alright, fine. I'm

01:43:42.440 --> 01:43:47.080
considering buying a few of my favorite games as downloadable games on Xbox via the games on demand

01:43:47.080 --> 01:43:51.160
service. I'm very lazy and can totally justify the purchase because my biggest problem currently is

01:43:51.160 --> 01:43:57.480
getting off my ass to change games. First world problems. Right? Here's the problem though. I

01:43:57.480 --> 01:44:02.360
remember hearing stories a while back about a Tom Clancy game not being fully compatible with

01:44:02.360 --> 01:44:07.560
multiplayer. Apparently the physical version was unable to play online multiplayer with the games

01:44:07.560 --> 01:44:12.520
on demand downloadable version. In the Xbox marketplace, all I know of the games say is that

01:44:12.520 --> 01:44:17.560
they don't support online multiplayer whatsoever. However, I know that's not true since I have a

01:44:17.560 --> 01:44:22.680
friend who owns Gears of War downloadable and he claims it's completely compatible. So I want to

01:44:22.680 --> 01:44:27.160
know if there's any website you guys know about where I can find the compatibility of these games.

01:44:27.160 --> 01:44:34.760
Thanks guys. Try Wikipedia. Or actually I'm gonna say the official Xbox forums because when shit

01:44:34.760 --> 01:44:39.480
like that is broken, you will hear the angry gamers and complaints on the official Xbox forum.

01:44:39.480 --> 01:44:43.000
So all you have to do is read through one of those. I vaguely remember what you're talking

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:47.720
about. I want to say that was fixed though. I think they did do some type of patch. I don't

01:44:47.720 --> 01:44:52.760
think Microsoft is intentionally leaving that shit out. But let's face it, the games on demand service

01:44:52.760 --> 01:44:58.200
is pretty lazy. All they're doing is they're, they're kind of doing what I talked about at the

01:44:58.200 --> 01:45:04.760
top of the show with the Wii hack. You can load the things, you load the disc into an image and

01:45:04.760 --> 01:45:10.920
Microsoft's basically selling you that image. And it is literally the, when you take the disc and

01:45:10.920 --> 01:45:16.040
install it to your hard drive on your 360, it's literally that image that they're selling you. But

01:45:16.040 --> 01:45:23.400
which is fine. It's legit. It's not piracy. It's through their store. It's fine. But that's,

01:45:23.400 --> 01:45:29.560
you know, essentially they don't do the extensive quality checks that are done when a game is first

01:45:29.560 --> 01:45:34.600
released. Let's put it that way. They might do some minimal quality checks, but you know,

01:45:34.600 --> 01:45:40.280
very minimal as you can see by that little story there. But those sort of instances should be few

01:45:40.280 --> 01:45:43.560
and far between. To the best of my knowledge, those games are supposed to be playable online.

01:45:43.560 --> 01:45:47.400
They're supposed to be just like copies of the regular games. It's not supposed to be anything

01:45:47.400 --> 01:45:52.920
crazy or something Microsoft's locking you out of. But I will say this, you know, if you know,

01:45:52.920 --> 01:45:56.360
it's your money. Spend it how you want. If downloading the game so you don't have to get

01:45:56.360 --> 01:46:02.600
up and put a disc in is that important to you, then fine. Do it. But just don't be afraid to

01:46:02.600 --> 01:46:07.560
shop smart too. And what I mean by that is don't assume that the price you see on Xbox downloadable

01:46:07.560 --> 01:46:12.840
is necessarily the cheapest. What's more important to you? Getting up off the couch to change the

01:46:12.840 --> 01:46:18.840
disc or getting it cheapest. You know, because you might be able to find a used copy on eBay

01:46:19.400 --> 01:46:24.840
really cheap or possibly you could even find Amazon is having a sale or Best Buy is having

01:46:24.840 --> 01:46:29.400
a sale. Best Buy had a great Kinect sale a couple of months ago where it was like buy one, get one

01:46:29.400 --> 01:46:34.920
free. So, you know, always be on the lookout for things like that. I'm just going to buy. Tell me

01:46:34.920 --> 01:46:38.680
about that. You know, but at the end of the day, again, it's your money. Spend it how you want.

01:46:38.680 --> 01:46:44.840
And certainly I've downloaded my share of download games. Granted, that's mostly the arcade stuff.

01:46:44.840 --> 01:46:51.400
But let me I will say this. When I had swine flu back in 09, I did. I had swine flows out of work

01:46:51.400 --> 01:46:57.560
for nine days. I downloaded a game digitally because I was not allowed to leave my house

01:46:57.560 --> 01:47:02.280
for my doctor. So I think in that case, I might have a legitimate reason for having done that,

01:47:02.280 --> 01:47:07.400
you know, and I downloaded I remember I would have left my house anyway. It was it was 32nd

01:47:07.400 --> 01:47:12.200
Hero on the P.S.P. to as many people or half minute hero, whatever it was. So yeah, who cares

01:47:12.200 --> 01:47:18.360
about coworkers? All right. I think it's actually pretty funny. And just to make a quick mention

01:47:19.240 --> 01:47:26.200
is that that's actually like where the source of most illness is, is from the workplace.

01:47:28.360 --> 01:47:34.920
You know, since I have not been working, Rob, I've only been sick, like really sick once.

01:47:34.920 --> 01:47:41.400
Yeah, I know. It's crazy. Quarantined here in the safety of my home.

01:47:42.600 --> 01:47:46.840
All right. Let's move on. Since that was the end of the email bag, right?

01:47:46.840 --> 01:47:50.360
Yes, it was. We need more emails. Two, two emails. That was,

01:47:50.360 --> 01:47:52.440
that was a sad showing. If I get ten emails next week,

01:47:52.440 --> 01:47:55.000
Rob has to get me an Orchata. I'm not going to do shit.

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:58.920
Okay. Well, that's because you're not here. And the week after, if we have ten emails the week

01:47:58.920 --> 01:48:03.400
after, then I will get Rob an Orchata. Okay, now we're talking.

01:48:03.400 --> 01:48:10.040
And then Rob will get me an Orchata. Okay. Ten emails means Orchata trading

01:48:10.040 --> 01:48:10.920
happens. Yes.

01:48:12.680 --> 01:48:16.840
Actually, it'll just be Mexican drink night here at Orange Lounge Radio.

01:48:16.840 --> 01:48:19.480
You can get a Tamarindo. I'll go get some Jarritos.

01:48:20.920 --> 01:48:26.280
And I will get Orchata and then we can have some, what's that, apple soda?

01:48:26.280 --> 01:48:32.840
That's what I'm thinking of, I think. No, the Jarritos makes the tamarind soda.

01:48:32.840 --> 01:48:34.200
Yeah. And they have,

01:48:34.200 --> 01:48:39.240
I think the same company makes an apple soda and they have like a lime soda.

01:48:39.240 --> 01:48:41.240
And we'll go to Target and get. And they have a sangria.

01:48:41.240 --> 01:48:44.040
We'll go to Target and we'll get the Coke that's actually from Mexico

01:48:44.840 --> 01:48:47.160
that has like the real sugar in it. And it's kosher.

01:48:48.360 --> 01:48:49.320
Passover. There you go. So,

01:48:51.320 --> 01:48:56.920
and then, then we'll drink lots of tequila. So, ten emails for Mexican drink night at,

01:48:56.920 --> 01:49:02.120
for a fiesta in studio here at Orange Lounge Radio. All right.

01:49:04.680 --> 01:49:08.840
We got to get to the FUs of the week. Every week on the show we get a little bit angsty

01:49:08.840 --> 01:49:27.880
and we have to share our angst with you all. Why? Because we can.

01:49:27.880 --> 01:49:32.520
FU to Northrend. First world problems.

01:49:32.520 --> 01:49:39.080
Uh, Loki. Uh, FVDAC Vision for putting on a game called

01:49:39.080 --> 01:49:47.320
Skylanders Spyro's Adventure. Skylanders is, first off, a really terrible Spyro game.

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.880
Just Spyro isn't what he used to be. I mean, come on.

01:49:51.880 --> 01:49:56.280
But to make things more complicated, they're trying to make this game like

01:49:56.280 --> 01:50:02.840
the must have item for Christmas. So, it's got toys with it. Thirty different collectible toys.

01:50:02.840 --> 01:50:05.560
All different things at the set up. Different three packs of toys.

01:50:05.560 --> 01:50:09.160
Different adventure sets of toys. And they're like, oh, well, it's like download content,

01:50:09.160 --> 01:50:14.520
but it's physical. You know what these download content or physical download content pieces cost?

01:50:14.520 --> 01:50:19.640
Eight dollars. Eight dollars for a toy that does nothing. It is literally a figurine is about

01:50:19.640 --> 01:50:25.480
two inches tall. It does nothing. It doesn't move. It doesn't do anything other than activate

01:50:25.480 --> 01:50:33.640
activated character in a game. So, why kids would buy that or parents would buy that instead of,

01:50:33.640 --> 01:50:39.880
I don't know, a Mario game or I don't know, any other toy out there on the market is beyond me.

01:50:39.880 --> 01:50:46.440
And on top of all that, they want to sell this thing starting off at $70. $70 for a Wii game,

01:50:46.440 --> 01:50:52.600
PS3 game, 360 game, because it comes with some bullshit toys that weren't really toys.

01:50:52.600 --> 01:50:56.120
What would you like to see sell more? Tickle Me Elmo or this thing?

01:50:56.120 --> 01:51:00.440
Anything. Anything other than this. And you know what? I predict right now that this is going to

01:51:00.440 --> 01:51:07.080
be as big of a failure as Tony Hawk Shred, Tony Hawk Ride, and sadly enough, DJ Hero 2.

01:51:07.080 --> 01:51:09.720
So, meaning like a year and a half later, I'll be able to get them for $10?

01:51:09.720 --> 01:51:15.480
Oh, yes. Yes. I really wish I could have gotten some of those Renegade or the

01:51:16.120 --> 01:51:20.280
bundles with all the stuff. You know what's even better with that stuff? Flip it on fucking eBay.

01:51:20.280 --> 01:51:24.840
For, you know, you can make more than $10 off that. Hell, you know what you could do with that

01:51:24.840 --> 01:51:29.080
kind of stuff? If you got, you know, the extra turntables and stuff? You could flip it to Game

01:51:29.080 --> 01:51:34.760
Stop and make more than $10 off of that if you really wanted to go that route. But I mean,

01:51:34.760 --> 01:51:39.720
that's just money in the bag right there. But yes, it will not sell very well. Because you know

01:51:39.720 --> 01:51:44.360
why? Because there's a lot of kids games coming out this holiday and, you know, with Mario and

01:51:44.360 --> 01:51:50.600
stuff on the 3DS and on the console systems, everything else in Call of Duty, no one's gonna

01:51:50.600 --> 01:51:58.040
give a shit about Spyro, a character that was popular 10 years ago. I think we have some Spyro

01:51:58.040 --> 01:52:02.840
fans in chat. I've seen them before, but it is still a big buy-in to ask of them. I understand

01:52:02.840 --> 01:52:07.960
that you may be Spyro fans, but take a look at the new Spyro. This is not Spyro from 10 years ago.

01:52:07.960 --> 01:52:15.080
This is like, we made Spyro angry and emo, is what it is. It's just cashing in on the Spyro

01:52:15.080 --> 01:52:21.400
franchise. That's why it's Skylanders Spyro Adventures. It's not Spyro blah, blah, blah.

01:52:22.120 --> 01:52:30.040
It's Skylanders with Spyro, basically. You done? I'm done. Oh, finally. All right, uh,

01:52:30.840 --> 01:52:37.080
my view of the week goes to Peanut Butter Pinkberry, because you guys, it's so good. Like,

01:52:37.080 --> 01:52:42.200
they do one where they put strawberry jam on it and toasted bread crumbs, and oh my God,

01:52:42.200 --> 01:52:46.360
oh my God, it's so good. But here's why I give it an FU, because, well, A, it's good,

01:52:46.360 --> 01:52:51.640
and B, it's not non-fat or low-fat. Every other flavor in Pinkberry's history has been like

01:52:51.640 --> 01:52:57.640
non-fat or low-fat, but this one? Extra fat. Extra fat. Seven grams of fat a serving, which,

01:52:57.640 --> 01:53:03.480
you know, ice cream's worse, but still, that's a little disappointing. Special occasions only.

01:53:03.480 --> 01:53:09.000
I know, this is a real problem, right? All right, there it is, FUs of the Week. More news stories

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:15.400
for you guys, and then the Skype line is about five stories away. So Ubisoft is apparently

01:53:15.400 --> 01:53:23.240
trying to pull a THQ and put out a tablet peripheral for, I guess, the Wii. It looks

01:53:23.240 --> 01:53:28.680
like it's supposed to be for the Wii. It's a, right now they're kind of a, it's a work in

01:53:28.680 --> 01:53:34.280
progress thing, a project in touch, and they have an internal marketing video that's been

01:53:34.920 --> 01:53:43.160
found leaked out there. Basically, they have some sort of a tablet that's gonna be used to

01:53:43.160 --> 01:53:46.360
play games and stuff. It's basically all the same stuff that you see right now with the UDraw.

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:54.920
I don't know. It's interesting, I guess. I don't know, UDraw's doing all right,

01:53:54.920 --> 01:53:59.320
but I don't know if there's really room on the market for multiple tablet peripherals.

01:54:00.200 --> 01:54:05.880
I was gonna say, UDraw's done quite well for a third-party peripheral. Usually those don't do

01:54:05.880 --> 01:54:11.080
too hot. I mean, the last, you know, well, okay, you got a Guitar Hero and that whole thing did

01:54:11.080 --> 01:54:15.080
well. DDR pads did pretty good, but you know, there's a lot of peripherals that come out the

01:54:15.080 --> 01:54:20.200
tank too, like the skateboard thing. That tank's pretty hardcore. Yeah, unfortunately.

01:54:20.200 --> 01:54:29.240
So it's hard to convince people to buy more plastic shit and a hundred dollar skateboard

01:54:29.240 --> 01:54:33.800
for a game that, you know, it's really going to be the only game that's going to support it,

01:54:33.800 --> 01:54:38.200
or two games. So why is UDraw succeeded and where this one is trying to get some of this

01:54:38.200 --> 01:54:44.040
success? Well, UDraw succeeded because they've got a lot of different games that come out for it.

01:54:44.040 --> 01:54:51.320
Right now they have, I think it's about five games right now that support it, and there's a lot more

01:54:51.320 --> 01:54:56.520
coming out this fall. Plus there's going to be more UDraw stuff on other systems. You get it on

01:54:56.520 --> 01:55:02.680
the Playstation 3 and 360 as well this year. And on top of that, besides the licensed stuff that

01:55:02.680 --> 01:55:09.320
THQ's done, like with Spongebob and their Marvel stuff, they've got now licenses from other

01:55:09.320 --> 01:55:15.720
companies like Disney Princess stuff. And actually there's going to be a Mickey drawing program or

01:55:15.720 --> 01:55:20.120
something like that. Disney animation program. Gosh, that sounds like fun. That would be kind

01:55:20.120 --> 01:55:24.520
of cool. So, you know, they're getting other companies to support this kind of thing. So

01:55:24.520 --> 01:55:28.840
Ubisoft, I'm sure if you played your cards right and talked to THQ, they would probably let you

01:55:28.840 --> 01:55:34.040
make a game for, you know, the UDraw tablet. Save yourself a whole bunch of time. Instead,

01:55:34.040 --> 01:55:38.440
you're going to put out this other peripheral. Now why would they do that? Why would they do

01:55:38.440 --> 01:55:42.920
that? Exactly. Why would you concede to another company to make it a lot easier for yourself when

01:55:42.920 --> 01:55:45.880
you can just make something that'll fail on your own? And you can just fucking steamroll with all

01:55:45.880 --> 01:55:50.680
your franchises. Yeah. Well, why would we bother publishing with the UDraw when we can make our

01:55:50.680 --> 01:55:56.440
own and take the market from UDraw? It's just, I don't think there's really going to be a market

01:55:56.440 --> 01:56:03.000
for it, but we'll see. Whatever. They've tried to think outside the box with different stuff.

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:08.520
I mean, remember, it was the last E3, they had a bunch of games that weren't really games. Like,

01:56:08.520 --> 01:56:17.080
they had some sort of relaxation program or something like that where you basically...

01:56:18.360 --> 01:56:27.320
It was basically the... What was it? The... That stupid Wii peripheral that they had that they

01:56:27.320 --> 01:56:31.560
never put out. I don't remember the hell it was. The Vitality Sensor. It was basically the Vitality

01:56:31.560 --> 01:56:36.440
Sensor but on the PC. And they had that come out and they had some laser tag game come out that

01:56:36.440 --> 01:56:42.280
wasn't really a game. It was just something ran on the PC that... It was basically laser tag a toy.

01:56:42.280 --> 01:56:50.760
And they had one other thing that was kind of along the lines of that. But yeah, they're

01:56:50.760 --> 01:56:58.680
definitely trying some unique stuff over there at Ubisoft. All right. Well, we'll see if it

01:56:58.680 --> 01:57:02.760
works for them. I don't know. I think flooding the market with too much of this similar shit

01:57:02.760 --> 01:57:07.240
is going to end up being a bad thing, but we'll see. Anyhow, there's been rumors going around

01:57:07.240 --> 01:57:12.840
forever that Diablo 3, big PC release coming out later this year, big rumor for the longest time

01:57:12.840 --> 01:57:17.240
that it'll probably end up on consoles as well. Well, let's just fan the flames of that fire

01:57:17.240 --> 01:57:22.760
because during a Gamescom press conference this week, Josh Mosquera, who's the lead designer

01:57:22.760 --> 01:57:28.760
behind Diablo 3, said that Blizzard is, quote, very, very serious about bringing the Diablo 3 experience

01:57:28.760 --> 01:57:34.200
to the console. The company is, quote, trying to build the best console team at Blizzard.

01:57:34.760 --> 01:57:39.000
Now, they're not saying what game they're working on, but you can expect it's probably Diablo or

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:43.720
it's the new MMO. You know, that would be ironic if that was the case because, you know, in Diablo 3,

01:57:43.720 --> 01:57:48.040
don't you have to be connected to the internet the whole time to play the game? Yes. But the

01:57:48.040 --> 01:57:56.680
console version, you probably wouldn't have to be. That's maybe or maybe not true. That could be

01:57:56.680 --> 01:58:00.520
a sticking point for why it's not on the consoles right now. I would think that whole real money

01:58:00.520 --> 01:58:06.280
trade auction house is what's holding things up, especially when it comes to Xbox 360. I could not

01:58:06.280 --> 01:58:11.480
see that shit flying on the 360 without Microsoft getting a cut of that somehow. Although, then again,

01:58:11.480 --> 01:58:16.280
to have Diablo 3 on their console would be a pretty big score for them. It would have to be online

01:58:16.280 --> 01:58:22.680
only, and if not, that thing would get hacked apart. Maybe they're gonna keep it separate from

01:58:22.680 --> 01:58:27.320
the PC one somehow. That's true. They could do that without the real money auction house. Yep.

01:58:27.880 --> 01:58:35.640
So, we will see. But for now, that's all we know. More rumors to fuel those fires. So,

01:58:36.200 --> 01:58:39.800
I don't care. I'm still getting Diablo 3 just because I was such a sucker for the first one,

01:58:39.800 --> 01:58:46.840
so whatever. I don't think I am. Aw, sad face. I never got into the other Diablo games. So,

01:58:47.800 --> 01:58:51.160
all right. Well, let's move on. Dark Soccer, you got more news for us, right?

01:58:52.600 --> 01:59:00.040
Well, it's Square actually. Square Enix. We can't call them Square Enix anymore, I don't think.

01:59:00.680 --> 01:59:06.680
They've filed a new trademark that's just Square. So, who knows? Maybe they'll be going back to

01:59:06.680 --> 01:59:13.000
Square, which actually makes sense because I'm gonna use this as an example. The company that

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:20.520
I used to work for when I was doing student loans, we were Educaid. When Wachovia purchased the

01:59:20.520 --> 01:59:26.760
company, they've actually purchased First Union, which owned Educaid and the money store and all

01:59:26.760 --> 01:59:32.920
that. But we had to brand ourselves as Educaid Wachovia, and then after a while, we became

01:59:32.920 --> 01:59:41.880
Wachovia Student Services or whatever. But it's the same thing, I think. Now that they've got

01:59:41.880 --> 01:59:51.160
Square and Enix in everybody's head, they're gonna rebrand back to Square. It makes perfect sense.

01:59:51.160 --> 01:59:55.800
Well, I also think of, remember when there was G4 and then there was Tech TV,

01:59:55.800 --> 02:00:00.920
and then there was G4 Tech TV, and then it was like chomp, and now it's just G4 again.

02:00:00.920 --> 02:00:06.360
Yeah, it's just part of rebranding. With any acquisition, especially with a big company,

02:00:06.360 --> 02:00:11.000
something that's well known, you have to merge your branding so that people will start associating

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:17.080
one with the other. I'm still sad to see the name Enix go away because now we'll never get another

02:00:17.080 --> 02:00:24.440
bust to move. We might, but it won't say Enix on it. That's true. That's okay. I'll just bust out

02:00:24.440 --> 02:00:31.240
my other two bust moves. Play them. Alright, so we'll see what happens with that. Couple more

02:00:31.240 --> 02:00:36.680
stories for you guys, then we're gonna get to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR. But not just yet,

02:00:36.680 --> 02:00:43.720
Loki's got a story for us. Yeah, there's some interesting stuff on the PlayStation Network

02:00:43.720 --> 02:00:50.360
front. They're actually gonna start offering some cheaper rentals for different movies and TV shows.

02:00:50.360 --> 02:00:56.680
99 cent movie and TV rentals are coming, and right now they've got a really small list of what's

02:00:56.680 --> 02:01:01.880
gonna be available. I guess every Tuesday a selection of movies and TV rentals will see a

02:01:01.880 --> 02:01:11.480
discount of 99 cents for the SD versions and $1.99 for HD. I believe this week was Sicko,

02:01:11.480 --> 02:01:20.840
The Longshots, Salvage, Tony, Shank, Bonded by Blood, JFK, Reckless Youth Part 1 and Part 2,

02:01:20.840 --> 02:01:34.920
Deadly Blessing, Carver, Devil in the Flesh, and Illuminating Angels and Demons. That was what was

02:01:34.920 --> 02:01:38.440
on there. So they're gonna be discounting stuff each week. That's kind of neat, I guess, to drive

02:01:38.440 --> 02:01:44.840
a little bit more sales in that category. Especially maybe they compete a little bit with

02:01:46.120 --> 02:01:51.480
Redbox and Netflix. Yeah, but the stuff they're offering is crap. Have you looked at what's on

02:01:51.480 --> 02:01:57.800
the list? It's all a bunch of crap. But hey, you know what? Something cheaper is still better than

02:01:57.800 --> 02:02:01.480
nothing cheaper. I still don't see how any of that stuff's really a better value than Netflix,

02:02:01.480 --> 02:02:05.400
although I guess Netflix is kind of challenged for a lot of content and may continue to be

02:02:05.400 --> 02:02:10.120
challenged over the next year or what have you. But I don't know. Like I was looking. One of my

02:02:10.120 --> 02:02:15.720
friends uses that Vudu site and I kind of saw that for the first time over the weekend. And I don't

02:02:15.720 --> 02:02:20.440
know. It seemed too expensive for me. I was like, dang, they want too much money for all these

02:02:20.440 --> 02:02:24.600
rentals of old stuff. I don't know. I guess everything seems expensive next to Netflix

02:02:24.600 --> 02:02:29.320
where you're paying the one fee for the whole month, you know? Yeah, I don't know. It's just me.

02:02:29.320 --> 02:02:36.280
All right. One other story for you guys, and this has to do with Portal 2. Of course you love Portal

02:02:36.280 --> 02:02:43.240
2, right, DarkSakura? Yeah. DarkSakura speaks for all the... Yeah. Well, Portal 2, you know,

02:02:43.240 --> 02:02:47.160
we were supposed to be getting download content. Where the hell is it? It was supposed to be here

02:02:47.160 --> 02:02:54.680
in the summer and it's still not here. Put his house down. Apparently, it's going to be happening

02:02:54.680 --> 02:03:00.280
in September. September is when the download content will be coming out. And they are saying

02:03:00.280 --> 02:03:05.160
it's free. So if you're like all huffy and puffy about the fact that the download content still is

02:03:05.160 --> 02:03:09.080
now, you know what? Good things come to those who wait. They have not said what the download

02:03:09.080 --> 02:03:15.480
content might include. And all that's being said about it is that Valve's Doug Lombardi

02:03:15.480 --> 02:03:22.600
apparently said, quote, it's still technically summer. Which he does have a point, right?

02:03:22.600 --> 02:03:29.480
Fall doesn't really start until what? September 21st? So technically it is still summer in early

02:03:29.480 --> 02:03:34.600
September. So fine. That's the dorkiest thing I've ever heard. You win on this technicality.

02:03:34.600 --> 02:03:41.000
You better have it out or we're sending more protesters out to protest in front of Valve

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:47.960
because that's the thing people do these days. All right. I guess that's going to do it for

02:03:47.960 --> 02:03:55.480
news tonight. And we're going to go to the Skype line. 1-877-GAME-OLR. Our username on Skype is

02:03:55.480 --> 02:04:03.400
OrangeLoungeRadio. And we're going to take your calls throughout the night. It's open now. I'm

02:04:03.400 --> 02:04:07.880
going to also get to the Twitter and try to splice in some Twitter topics in between here,

02:04:08.440 --> 02:04:12.360
which I didn't load up in advance because I was not planning well tonight. But again,

02:04:12.360 --> 02:04:19.240
that's Twitter.com slash OLR. It's the show where every gamer has a voice and we welcome that

02:04:19.240 --> 02:04:25.480
through the phones or through our Twitter. Or of course, there's always the chat room if you're

02:04:25.480 --> 02:04:31.000
like, you know, I don't have a Twitter or I'm too lazy to call or what have you. Our tweeter brings

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:37.480
all the calls. You can always do it that way. And it's like damn right my call quality is better

02:04:37.480 --> 02:04:45.720
than yours. What? I don't know. All right. Let's see. Trying to go to some of the tweets here

02:04:47.160 --> 02:04:55.400
from earlier in the week. We got wished a happy third tw-birthday. Nice. By who?

02:04:57.160 --> 02:05:02.840
A tw-birthday or some account. I don't know. It's probably a spam account. Who knows? All

02:05:02.840 --> 02:05:06.760
right. Let's go to the phone. You've been on Twitter a while. Have a dollar. Hey, you're

02:05:06.760 --> 02:05:10.200
on Orange House Radio. Who's this? It's Death Wishing. Oh my God. I can see you.

02:05:11.400 --> 02:05:18.280
Yeah, you can. Thank God you have a shirt on. What's up? I'm playing Eve Online. What's Eve?

02:05:18.280 --> 02:05:23.640
Okay. I've never played Eve Online before. What's Eve Online like? Space cowboy with

02:05:23.640 --> 02:05:33.240
tons of space rocks and mining and just people being assholes. I mean, I can give you an example.

02:05:33.240 --> 02:05:37.320
It's a lot harder than World of Warcraft. And it's a lot better in my opinion,

02:05:37.320 --> 02:05:40.520
because you can pretty much do whatever you want. You don't have to follow your class guideline.

02:05:42.360 --> 02:05:46.040
The customization, they recently also just released an expansion where you can walk around

02:05:46.040 --> 02:05:51.560
the stations, which is also going to work, build it into the game Dust 514. If you also heard of

02:05:51.560 --> 02:05:55.240
that, which I kind of want to talk about. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Let's talk about that a

02:05:55.240 --> 02:06:00.120
little bit. Cause I did hear about that at E3 and it sounded really exciting. What's this all about?

02:06:00.120 --> 02:06:04.440
Well, think of, you know, the game PlanetSide and did you ever play it?

02:06:06.680 --> 02:06:13.240
No. Well, Dust is a first-person shooter. Hold on. I got to put my glasses on. That

02:06:14.920 --> 02:06:20.360
is going to be pretty much just like PlanetSide, but for the PS3 only the PS3, which is weird,

02:06:20.360 --> 02:06:25.560
but it's going to tie into Eve Online where basically it will work as in corporations,

02:06:25.560 --> 02:06:30.200
the player run corporations that are on Eve Online will be able to hire mercenaries from

02:06:30.200 --> 02:06:35.480
the PlayStation 3 to fight over planets in the Eve universe, which basically they will fight over

02:06:35.480 --> 02:06:38.760
minerals, blah, blah, whatever the hell's on the planet. It could be just a pile of shit. I don't

02:06:38.760 --> 02:06:47.720
know. And basically corporations will buy us the PlayStation 3 users all their weaponry, all their

02:06:47.720 --> 02:06:54.040
tanks and stuff. So basically if you, the plate, the PC users supply the their mercenary corporation,

02:06:54.040 --> 02:07:00.120
they earn pretty much unlimited wealth. And that's what Dust is. And Eve Online is really hard to

02:07:00.120 --> 02:07:06.920
explain. All I can say is, is it's hard. What makes it so, what makes it so rewarding to be

02:07:06.920 --> 02:07:12.120
playing the game? Because it's, I don't know, it's just unlike everything in this game is basically

02:07:12.120 --> 02:07:16.360
player run. They have player run banks that people make real spreadsheets and stuff where you put

02:07:16.360 --> 02:07:20.680
your in-game money like, and it works exactly like a real bank building interest, taking out

02:07:20.680 --> 02:07:25.640
loans and stuff like that. But then, as you would think, there's also people that scan that system.

02:07:25.640 --> 02:07:31.000
Like, I think a couple months ago, there was a guy who made a bank, made it for two years, got about

02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:36.120
870 billion isk, transferred all that money to another account, closed his account down, and all

02:07:36.120 --> 02:07:39.640
of the users were complaining that they lost money, right? Right. The freaking corporation

02:07:39.640 --> 02:07:45.240
just told them, or the CCP who runs the game said, welcome to the game, don't trust people.

02:07:45.240 --> 02:07:52.600
Don't trust people. And it doesn't hold your hand like World of Warcraft. Did I say that?

02:07:52.600 --> 02:07:55.160
Yeah, you did mention that a little bit, I think so.

02:07:55.160 --> 02:08:01.400
Yeah, it's hard to explain, but I don't know. Also, I want to say that I hate Activision.

02:08:02.200 --> 02:08:03.400
Why do you hate Activision?

02:08:03.400 --> 02:08:06.120
Because the guy who runs the company is such an asshole.

02:08:06.120 --> 02:08:07.240
Bobby Kotick?

02:08:07.240 --> 02:08:11.880
Yeah, he ruins like game series. He's ruined Tony Hawk, he ruined Call of Duty, and now he's

02:08:11.880 --> 02:08:20.120
gonna be here in Spyro. What fuckery set you off this week? Besides jobs, um, Activision.

02:08:21.480 --> 02:08:24.200
I think there's a bit of personal bitterness here to this. I don't know if this-

02:08:24.200 --> 02:08:26.680
I'm just an angry person, an angry college kid.

02:08:27.960 --> 02:08:30.360
You're just an angry listener, an angry gamer.

02:08:31.480 --> 02:08:36.440
Yes. I usually have more to talk about, but I'm actually a boring person this week. I'm kind of

02:08:36.440 --> 02:08:38.280
on a recovery day.

02:08:38.280 --> 02:08:43.960
Sorry, let me read this tweet for a recovery day. Was Burning Man this week or something?

02:08:45.800 --> 02:08:47.800
Don't worry about it. What were you gonna say?

02:08:47.800 --> 02:08:49.960
Alright, fine. Tigerclaw says,

02:08:49.960 --> 02:08:56.360
EVE Online is by far the most hardcore- hardest core game in its existence. Agree?

02:08:56.360 --> 02:09:01.400
I totally agree. Especially since my corporation got attacked last week and we lost like 500

02:09:01.400 --> 02:09:02.440
million. So.

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:03.720
Yikes.

02:09:03.720 --> 02:09:08.040
Which, um, yeah. I can also say one thing. A lot of the money in the game amounts to real money,

02:09:08.040 --> 02:09:13.160
so like there's ships that cost- they're called Titan class ships. $10,000 real currency.

02:09:15.400 --> 02:09:16.680
They're just throwing that out there.

02:09:16.680 --> 02:09:18.520
$10,000 in real currency.

02:09:18.520 --> 02:09:19.160
Real currency.

02:09:19.800 --> 02:09:21.320
And people buy it.

02:09:21.320 --> 02:09:26.120
360 million is $15 a currency, which you can use the currency that you make in-game to buy

02:09:26.120 --> 02:09:27.960
your in-game subscription.

02:09:27.960 --> 02:09:31.960
Right, right. I've heard of that. You can buy these cards or something that you use, right?

02:09:32.760 --> 02:09:37.320
Like, was there a big story where they blew up a big carrier that was carrying a bunch of

02:09:37.320 --> 02:09:39.240
those cards and like all this game time was just lost?

02:09:39.240 --> 02:09:44.200
Yeah, I forgot what it was. I think it was some player who was really retarded. I believe

02:09:44.200 --> 02:09:49.400
you can put that stuff in your, uh, like a hangar. And he was retarded and kept it around

02:09:49.400 --> 02:09:54.200
and went for him for god knows why. So people heard about it, killed him, took game time.

02:09:54.840 --> 02:09:55.720
Your fault.

02:09:55.720 --> 02:10:00.680
Yikes. All right. Well, Deathwishing, we're going to let you go, but thanks for the call.

02:10:00.680 --> 02:10:05.640
And thanks for the webcam. It's interesting to see our listeners there. So we're not

02:10:05.640 --> 02:10:07.640
hooking one up so you can see us though. All right.

02:10:07.640 --> 02:10:10.200
I'm not fat. Don't worry about it.

02:10:10.200 --> 02:10:12.040
All right. Take care. All right. All right. Later.

02:10:12.040 --> 02:10:13.160
Mine rock time. Bye.

02:10:16.600 --> 02:10:20.440
I want to see more. Well, maybe, maybe that's something I don't want to wish. Maybe I don't

02:10:20.440 --> 02:10:24.200
want to see more of the listeners, but, uh, yeah, sure. Why not call us with your webcams?

02:10:24.200 --> 02:10:24.760
It'll be fun.

02:10:24.760 --> 02:10:26.280
We want to see the sexy ones.

02:10:26.280 --> 02:10:31.320
All right. Now the 877 number is apparently broken, but there is a back door you can use.

02:10:31.320 --> 02:10:38.200
916-226-9067. I want to point out that is not a toll free number. So if you don't have

02:10:38.200 --> 02:10:42.600
like a cell phone that has free nationwide long distance, that number will not work.

02:10:42.600 --> 02:10:45.480
It looks like someone's using that number right now. Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio. Who's this?

02:10:46.600 --> 02:10:48.600
It's Shane, the Kletov, whatever.

02:10:48.600 --> 02:10:52.920
Hey, what's up, me Kletov? Again, I want to clarify. 877. I don't know. It's like,

02:10:52.920 --> 02:10:57.320
I'm having problems with the phone constantly last week and now this week. 877 number will not work.

02:10:57.320 --> 02:11:01.080
Something's up with the toll free forwarder. You can use the back door.

02:11:01.080 --> 02:11:08.600
A 916-226-9067. Please only use that if you have free long distance, which a lot of cell

02:11:08.600 --> 02:11:14.280
phone companies do, but be very, very careful. All right. Uh, me Kletov, what's on your mind?

02:11:15.640 --> 02:11:17.000
Um, nothing.

02:11:18.920 --> 02:11:20.200
So you're just calling to say hey?

02:11:21.880 --> 02:11:29.000
No. Um, I meant to call him last week, but, um, I have a little anecdote that leads into a

02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:32.120
kind of stance I'm taking, I think. All right, let's hear it.

02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:40.040
Okay. So, uh, last week I was at work and we were doing a blood drive. Um, so I go get blood even

02:11:40.040 --> 02:11:45.800
though technically legally I'm not allowed to because laws are stupid. But, um, so I'm sitting

02:11:45.800 --> 02:11:51.320
there giving blood, being all bored and I bust out my phone and start playing some games on my phone

02:11:51.320 --> 02:11:55.640
and I'm having a really good time. Makes the time pass super quick. And then I'm, I'm starting to

02:11:55.640 --> 02:12:02.120
think about this, like, you know, I play games on my phone when I'm giving blood. I play games on my

02:12:02.120 --> 02:12:07.800
phone when I'm like waiting at the drive through to pick up food or order or whatever. I play games

02:12:07.800 --> 02:12:13.960
at work when I am in the back, uh, looking for stuff or quote unquote looking for stuff, uh, to

02:12:13.960 --> 02:12:22.760
put out. And it hits me that I feel like the mobile phone games now are really what's portable gaming

02:12:22.760 --> 02:12:29.400
that that's like the definition and like things like the Vita, the PSP, the DS too big, too bulky

02:12:29.400 --> 02:12:35.640
to really be portable systems. And I really begin to realize that I only use those portably if I'm

02:12:35.640 --> 02:12:43.400
like on a plane, otherwise I'm playing my portable systems at home. And I think that Nintendo and

02:12:43.400 --> 02:12:51.480
Sony are gonna find themselves in the same sort of mindset after a few years. Cause you know what,

02:12:51.480 --> 02:12:56.440
you know what, those things are just too big and bulky and the iPhone and the Android phone,

02:12:56.440 --> 02:13:02.680
their games are just way more accessible for your portable gaming nowadays. You know, it's interesting

02:13:02.680 --> 02:13:06.360
that you bring that up because Nintendo has been under a lot of pressure from their investors,

02:13:06.360 --> 02:13:11.480
especially after 3DS has not done so hot and they've had to slice or slice the cost of that.

02:13:11.480 --> 02:13:15.320
Um, Nintendo has been under a lot of pressure to basically develop iOS games is what their

02:13:15.320 --> 02:13:19.800
investors want them to do. And, uh, you know, Satoru Iwata is very staunchly against that,

02:13:19.800 --> 02:13:24.520
which, you know, Nintendo creating a Mario game for another system is damn near unheard of,

02:13:24.520 --> 02:13:28.120
except of course, I'm sure a lot of people are gonna jump in and say, but what about the 3DO?

02:13:28.120 --> 02:13:32.200
Well, okay. You all saw how well that worked out, right? So that's why Nintendo-

02:13:32.200 --> 02:13:32.680
CDI.

02:13:33.400 --> 02:13:38.840
I'm sorry. CDI. My bad. It was one of those 90s CD based systems. So, okay, fine. The CDI.

02:13:39.400 --> 02:13:42.200
Clearly that didn't work out well for them. They got fucking burned on that.

02:13:42.200 --> 02:13:45.720
I don't think they created it. They just licensed the character out.

02:13:45.720 --> 02:13:49.960
Well, still though, it just goes to show you how they're very protective of their shit and

02:13:49.960 --> 02:13:53.800
they don't want to do that. But you know, Nintendo already kind of tested the waters

02:13:53.800 --> 02:13:59.160
with that though. In Japan, they have that Pokemon trading card Riven game on the iPhone.

02:13:59.160 --> 02:14:02.760
The Pokemon company has tested, but that's not Nintendo themselves.

02:14:03.400 --> 02:14:07.160
That's Nintendo's brand. I mean, Pokemon is, I mean, yeah, it's a Pokemon company,

02:14:07.160 --> 02:14:11.880
but you're not gonna see Pokemon go over to Vita or Xbox.

02:14:11.880 --> 02:14:15.000
So you do bring up an interesting point though, is that the only place a lot of people tend

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:18.120
to play their portable gaming systems is at home. And that's kind of where I do a lot

02:14:18.120 --> 02:14:22.360
of my portable gaming too. Like, I have my 3DS kind of by my bed and maybe like when

02:14:22.360 --> 02:14:26.040
it's, you know, bedtime, quote unquote, and I go into bed and maybe I'll stay up for

02:14:26.040 --> 02:14:30.040
about 20 minutes and play the 3DS, you know? That's where I tend to do most of my portable

02:14:30.040 --> 02:14:30.520
gaming.

02:14:31.400 --> 02:14:35.400
Well, and you know, at E3 this year, I had my, I had my PSP, which stayed in my hotel

02:14:35.400 --> 02:14:42.280
room. I had my 3DS, which I used to get street pass tags and then play the little mini dungeon

02:14:42.280 --> 02:14:47.400
game because I did not have time, even when standing in line or not timed, I was not really

02:14:47.400 --> 02:14:52.440
comfortable holding that thing in my hand, playing some game that's in depth. Had I had

02:14:52.440 --> 02:14:57.560
something like Tiny Tower, I would have been all over my phone at that point and I probably

02:14:57.560 --> 02:15:01.960
would have needed to bring like a charger or something with me.

02:15:01.960 --> 02:15:07.320
I, I use my 3DS a lot at Disneyland and a lot of that has to, well, at least the last

02:15:07.320 --> 02:15:11.960
time I was there, I had the 3DS. I take, I took two trips since I've had my 3DS because

02:15:11.960 --> 02:15:15.800
I did really quick back-to-back trips back around Memorial Day and I took my 3DS both

02:15:15.800 --> 02:15:20.120
times and I, I street pass with a shit ton of people at Disneyland. In fact, I, I, I

02:15:20.120 --> 02:15:24.040
made a Twitter friend of a street passing, you know, it's just kind of funny how that

02:15:24.040 --> 02:15:27.800
whole thing works. And yeah, the dude that's a Twitter friend of mine is apparently some

02:15:27.800 --> 02:15:31.160
type of developer for Disney related stuff. So it's kind of, it's just really hilarious

02:15:31.160 --> 02:15:36.120
how that all works out. So, um, what did you do the street pass for? Did you do it to do

02:15:36.120 --> 02:15:42.120
that stupid, uh, fill in the puzzles or did you do it to do the stupid, like somewhat

02:15:42.120 --> 02:15:49.080
of an RPG? You can do both when you street pass. When you meet a character and they go,

02:15:49.080 --> 02:15:53.080
hello, it gives you their little URL. But yeah, well I was also street passing for Street

02:15:53.080 --> 02:15:57.400
Fighter 4 data and now I'll be street passing for Ridge Racer 3DS data. I want more ghosts

02:15:57.400 --> 02:16:01.560
to race against. I, I think there's a lot of really interesting things they can do with

02:16:01.560 --> 02:16:05.560
street pass. I just don't think any of the games out right now really sell that stuff

02:16:05.560 --> 02:16:09.320
very well, but I'm interested to see what, you know, future games can kind of think up

02:16:09.320 --> 02:16:14.760
with the street passing. That's very interesting to me. But, um, you know, I, I'm not to say

02:16:14.760 --> 02:16:20.280
I'm totally disagreeing with you because I think, you know, part of the reason the 3DS

02:16:20.280 --> 02:16:25.080
isn't selling does have to do with the fact that mobile phones are doing it in some ways

02:16:25.080 --> 02:16:31.240
better, definitely cheaper. And, uh, I, I think the price of portable games needs to

02:16:31.240 --> 02:16:37.560
come down to stay competitive with, uh, iOS games. I think charging 40 bucks for 3DS game

02:16:37.560 --> 02:16:40.840
isn't going to fly. And I think they're going to be in for a rude awakening pretty soon.

02:16:40.840 --> 02:16:44.600
If they can't get that price down to 20 bucks, kiss it goodbye.

02:16:46.360 --> 02:16:51.960
Yeah. I mean, I look at my portable games I'm playing right now. I pick up Zelda since

02:16:51.960 --> 02:16:58.440
it's launch, maybe once every week and a half. And then I bust out my phone to play, uh,

02:16:58.440 --> 02:17:03.000
Groove Coaster or Tiny Tower or Juke Beat, which I actually like a lot.

02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:05.320
Ew. Juke Beat's terrible.

02:17:06.360 --> 02:17:07.000
Oh, I love it.

02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:10.760
I'm sorry. Did you download any of the, did you download any of the

02:17:10.760 --> 02:17:12.680
download content stuff for Juke Beat?

02:17:13.480 --> 02:17:17.960
No, because they're all terrible sounding. I'm not going to listen to crappy songs.

02:17:17.960 --> 02:17:23.960
See? But that's just to start. The three that they have you begin with are awesome. I love

02:17:23.960 --> 02:17:26.360
that Contra song. And even the Frogger song is pretty good.

02:17:26.360 --> 02:17:30.280
I'll give you that. The Contra and Frogger songs are kind of cool. Kinda.

02:17:30.280 --> 02:17:37.640
And it is really too hard, but it's still better than what I'm playing on my 3DS. And

02:17:37.640 --> 02:17:42.760
my PSP is just a DJ Max console. That's all I use it for. And there's no new ones coming

02:17:42.760 --> 02:17:45.320
out right now for that. So it's gathering.

02:17:45.320 --> 02:17:48.760
I'm playing Tiny Tower right now while you're trying to talk. Like I'm half paying attention

02:17:48.760 --> 02:17:53.160
to you. I'm half restocking all my stores. Because now Bobby had to go and make it a

02:17:53.160 --> 02:17:54.680
contest. What?

02:17:56.280 --> 02:17:58.040
I said I was doing that. And then I called in.

02:17:59.080 --> 02:18:00.760
And then you go right back to it.

02:18:01.640 --> 02:18:05.320
Yeah. That then, wow. I'm just like, oh, I'm flying somewhere. Well, I got to check on

02:18:05.320 --> 02:18:09.640
my, my supplies, make sure everything's stocked up. And I just upgraded my elevator. So it's

02:18:09.640 --> 02:18:13.560
going faster. And I love it. Like it changed the game completely for me.

02:18:13.560 --> 02:18:22.280
There you go. All right. So, um, you, uh, you, uh, are thinking that mobile phone gaming

02:18:22.280 --> 02:18:27.800
is where it's at. Now that being said, I remember during the E3 shows, you were all over the

02:18:27.800 --> 02:18:33.880
Vita and you were very excited about the Vita. So even though you're saying this about mobile

02:18:33.880 --> 02:18:36.440
gaming, you're like, ah, but I'll still get a Vita at the end of the day.

02:18:37.320 --> 02:18:42.120
Yeah. Cause I don't foresee me going outside and busting out my Vita and playing Uncharted

02:18:42.120 --> 02:18:47.000
because that is not a game, honestly, that you want portable. That is a, I want to sit

02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:53.000
down and experience this awesome game with best headphones and all sorts of, you know,

02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:57.800
being comfortable. It's not, I want to stand on a bus or in a subway playing Uncharted.

02:18:58.280 --> 02:19:01.560
Um, one more comment from Chad, I got to let you guys, we can get some more calls,

02:19:01.560 --> 02:19:05.560
but cause you don't in the chat room says phones are not killing the 3DS. It's the lack of anything

02:19:05.560 --> 02:19:09.400
on the 3DS that's killing it. And I kind of tend to agree. That's really the 3DS, the biggest

02:19:09.400 --> 02:19:14.360
problem. But I also think the price of the games is really an issue. I mean, I think it's more of

02:19:14.360 --> 02:19:19.080
an issue than Nintendo wants to admit. I realize games are expensive to make, but there has to come

02:19:19.080 --> 02:19:23.720
a point where you go, we're not selling these games at $40. We have to cut the price to get

02:19:23.720 --> 02:19:28.600
these to sell. And maybe we'll sell three times as much. No, go ahead.

02:19:29.160 --> 02:19:34.200
I really hope that this price cut and then realizing how bad the system is doing

02:19:34.200 --> 02:19:40.040
forces them to make an actual real honest to goodness, 3d Pokemon game. That's not some

02:19:40.040 --> 02:19:45.880
spin-off like the new one in Japan. Cause I mean, that would get me to buy four more systems,

02:19:45.880 --> 02:19:49.800
even though I have one. I find like getting that red one too, just to have a red one,

02:19:49.800 --> 02:19:55.640
just to have a funny red one. Yeah. I had a red and a blue SP when they came out. So I can do a

02:19:55.640 --> 02:20:05.080
red and a blue 3DS. I decided keeping up with what I do, which is buy things I don't need.

02:20:05.080 --> 02:20:09.000
All right. Well, I'm going to let you go so we can get some more calls. All right.

02:20:09.880 --> 02:20:12.920
All right. Sounds good. Thanks for the call. No problem.

02:20:12.920 --> 02:20:21.320
Later. All right. Give us a call at area code 916-226-9067. Again, not toll free. The toll

02:20:21.320 --> 02:20:25.480
free number's down right now or call us on Skype. That's always free orange lounge radio, all one

02:20:25.480 --> 02:20:33.000
word on Skype. Um, I'll get to the Twitter topics in just a moment here. Um, let's see, I'm trying

02:20:33.000 --> 02:20:37.400
to get through some of these here. Um, trying to get through the feedback for last week's show and

02:20:37.400 --> 02:20:42.440
so forth. Um, what is this? I'm just trying to see if this is a story we've already covered.

02:20:44.520 --> 02:20:49.800
Uh, no, this is something that Eric RPG tweeted us, and this is about Nintendo 3DS. Could a new

02:20:49.800 --> 02:20:55.800
Fire Emblem game be on its way to the Nintendo 3DS? Uh, apparently a online gaming site called

02:20:55.800 --> 02:21:01.160
the Magic Box posted that a new Fire Emblem game will be announced by Nintendo fairly soon.

02:21:01.160 --> 02:21:05.480
Apparently it's called Fire Emblem Blue Sacred Sword and Red Demon Lance.

02:21:05.480 --> 02:21:09.480
Supposed to be a hundred years after Sealed Sword and the story will center around the Princess of

02:21:09.480 --> 02:21:14.760
Kingdom Burn and the Prince of Kingdom Lycia, and each will have a different story in their

02:21:14.760 --> 02:21:20.040
perspective. There will also be a new casual mode for beginners and lunatic mode for advanced

02:21:20.040 --> 02:21:25.640
players. No word on where this information is coming from, but, uh, sounds good enough to me.

02:21:25.640 --> 02:21:29.640
I don't know. Fire Emblem on 3DS seems like a logical next step, don't you think?

02:21:29.640 --> 02:21:36.360
It sounds like an educated guess to me. All right. All right. Uh, Spazernator PSN tweets us

02:21:36.360 --> 02:21:41.000
saying, uh, OLR, could you please say hi to your newest listener, Shirley in Arizona, please?

02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:46.840
Shirley. Shirley, we will. Hi. You just did, right? Yeah. All right. And I'm sure that's a

02:21:46.840 --> 02:21:52.200
pun that Shirley is terribly sick of hearing. All right, let's go to the phones and get more calls.

02:21:52.200 --> 02:21:56.120
Hi, you're on our sauce radio with this. Spudger Zaku here. Hey, Zaku, what's on your mind?

02:21:56.840 --> 02:22:01.880
Uh, nothing much. Just trying to recover from Ramna's barbecue he held at his place yesterday.

02:22:03.640 --> 02:22:07.960
What's this all about? What was happening at the barbecue? Uh, bacon wrapped sausage,

02:22:07.960 --> 02:22:12.600
a lot of food, a lot of, like, raunchy card games. We were just, like,

02:22:13.480 --> 02:22:17.320
and drawing, uh, and using Sharpies against other people while they were passed out.

02:22:19.160 --> 02:22:26.200
Like Jigglypuff. Yes, exactly like that. Oh, God, I can't believe it. You'll probably fill you in

02:22:26.200 --> 02:22:34.200
on the details. Anyways, so, they were mentioning Activision being the new devil, like, in the

02:22:34.200 --> 02:22:40.440
previous last two. I don't think they're the new devil. They've been the devil for at least a good

02:22:40.440 --> 02:22:47.400
year. Well, I mean, I know that's still debatable, but I mean, they're like, I don't know, it's like

02:22:47.400 --> 02:22:52.280
EA is starting to get to go back into the dark side, but then again, they've been doing pretty

02:22:52.280 --> 02:22:57.800
well ever since going away from it. It doesn't matter staying, staying in that point where

02:22:57.800 --> 02:23:03.000
you're making money, but you don't piss off the fan base like Activision does by just shoveling

02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:09.560
out crap. Like, I mean, you know, the way I see it right now is that Activision's trying to make

02:23:09.560 --> 02:23:17.160
amends by doing dedicated servers on, for Modern Warfare 3, but God knows what the, what restrictions

02:23:17.160 --> 02:23:21.240
they will have. Like, we don't know whether they're just going to be, like, rented servers,

02:23:21.240 --> 02:23:25.800
or there's better, or it's like a full no strings attached ones, like, you know, like in Call of

02:23:25.800 --> 02:23:32.280
Duty 4. Someone's like, when Activision tries to throw out something like that, I don't even think

02:23:32.280 --> 02:23:37.400
it's like, I don't even think it's them being genuine about it, just them trying to capitalize,

02:23:38.360 --> 02:23:43.080
trying to sweep, trying to bury all the transgressions that they did in the past.

02:23:43.080 --> 02:23:49.400
They're just trying to bury it, trying to like, you know, kiss and make up. And that right there

02:23:49.400 --> 02:23:53.560
is just like, it's not really sincere. Well, it's a company, and of course they're not sincere.

02:23:54.440 --> 02:24:01.160
No, I understand, but when they treated, but if you remember how that whole Modern Warfare 2 on PC,

02:24:01.160 --> 02:24:06.120
that whole thing went out, how that whole thing panned out, where they got rid of the dedicated

02:24:06.120 --> 02:24:11.880
servers, and you see a bunch of folks just like, they basically, they were, you know, they said,

02:24:11.880 --> 02:24:16.440
to hell with Activision, it's not worth it. I was one of them. I was this, you know, I was really

02:24:16.440 --> 02:24:22.120
hyped up for Modern Warfare 2 that year, until that, that news broke, and I just lost interest,

02:24:22.120 --> 02:24:26.600
and I got bad company too instead. You're talking about all those people that, you know, decide,

02:24:26.600 --> 02:24:31.080
hey, we're gonna basically form a group that's gonna boycott Modern Warfare 2, and then they

02:24:31.080 --> 02:24:36.280
were all playing Modern Warfare 2. I just stuck to my guns. I've, if you look at my Steam profile,

02:24:36.280 --> 02:24:40.680
I don't have that game. I have Call of Duty 4. I mean, the last good one with dedicated servers.

02:24:42.920 --> 02:24:49.320
It's like, I, I basically have not, I've never played Modern Warfare 2, not even in consoles.

02:24:49.320 --> 02:24:52.760
SSJ100Matt is in the chat, hold on, because I have to get this out here, because this is kind of

02:24:52.760 --> 02:24:57.640
funny, is saying, correction, Bobby Kotek is the new devil. Activision would be fine without him

02:24:57.640 --> 02:25:03.480
there. You agree? Well, yeah, I guess, that's, I guess that's what I was trying to refer to. I mean,

02:25:03.480 --> 02:25:08.920
he is personifying the evil intentions of the devil. Well, it's him and his company.

02:25:10.520 --> 02:25:17.640
But yeah, I mean, it's like, after seeing the, the 64, 64 player multiplayer video for Battlefield 3

02:25:17.640 --> 02:25:22.520
this, this week, I mean, like, like last week when, you know, during Gamescom, it's like,

02:25:22.520 --> 02:25:28.360
I don't have any incentive to buy Modern Warfare 3 anymore. It's like, sure, they may, they may

02:25:28.360 --> 02:25:32.760
throw in dedicated servers, but you're, you're gonna get a lot, you're gonna get your money's

02:25:32.760 --> 02:25:37.960
worth in, in terms of, like, production values and gameplay out of Battlefield 3, just by the looks

02:25:37.960 --> 02:25:43.000
of it. It's like... Are you going up for a console version or PC version? Both. I mean, I mean...

02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:47.800
What do you think of the origin stuff? Granted the, the console's like, what, 24 players, and

02:25:47.800 --> 02:25:53.720
obviously the PC's more, but it's, it's still pretty good from both, from both spectrums.

02:25:53.720 --> 02:25:57.160
What do you think the, what do you think the origin... Our Modern Warfare 3 is just doing is,

02:25:57.160 --> 02:26:03.640
is rehashing perks. That's it, that's all it is, is the, it base, the whole basis is, the more kills

02:26:03.640 --> 02:26:09.960
you get, the more, you know, the more balance you tip against the others. Is it... Like, you know,

02:26:09.960 --> 02:26:16.600
UAV, you're just spamming UAV air, airstrikes, and so forth. What, what about the fact that on PC

02:26:16.600 --> 02:26:22.520
you're forced to use origin? I don't know. I mean, I'm kind of, like, indifferent about it.

02:26:22.520 --> 02:26:28.600
I know I was holding out for them having to, having to sell it on Steam, but at this point,

02:26:28.600 --> 02:26:36.360
I may give it a shot, because at the end of the day, it's, it's like the same, it's like what,

02:26:36.360 --> 02:26:41.160
what Valve went through when they first released Half-Life 2. Like, when they first launched Steam,

02:26:41.160 --> 02:26:46.840
they were basically, they were completely dead set against it. They just hated it, they just hated

02:26:46.840 --> 02:26:52.440
its guts from the get-go, and now it's pretty much one of the top digital distributors, the top

02:26:52.440 --> 02:26:56.920
digital distributors. Yeah, it's the thing to have on PC right now. It's kind of the cool kids club.

02:26:57.640 --> 02:27:02.200
I understand, but as I said, it's like, origin, EA's gonna go through their own,

02:27:02.920 --> 02:27:09.320
their own Steam moment when, you know, when launching. So it's like, if EA can basically,

02:27:09.320 --> 02:27:15.800
you know, pass that test in terms of providing a decent alternative to Steam, then, then more power

02:27:15.800 --> 02:27:21.400
to them. If it, you know, as long as they bring it on par with it, then, then that, you know,

02:27:21.400 --> 02:27:26.360
it'll be, it'll be an easier pill to swallow. It won't be like eating a shit sandwich.

02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:30.840
All right. I gotta let you go so we can get more calls, but I gotta say this. I want to know when

02:27:30.840 --> 02:27:34.120
the next barbecue is happening, because I may need to come back out to New York for that, and I'm

02:27:34.120 --> 02:27:41.320
going to draw next summer next summer. Yes. Adam is only going to hold the only holds them like

02:27:41.320 --> 02:27:48.680
once a year, maybe labor day, but I demand one in my honor. Rama will throw one in my honor if I

02:27:48.680 --> 02:27:54.440
come visit. Yeah, I'm pretty sure he will. All right. Awesome. I get what I want. All right.

02:27:54.440 --> 02:28:00.040
Take care of Zaku. Thanks for the call. Have a good one. I love the New York contingent. We have

02:28:00.040 --> 02:28:03.320
a lot of fans in New York. I don't know how it happened. Well, I guess there's a lot of people

02:28:03.320 --> 02:28:08.040
in New York, so it makes sense, but still we have quite a few listeners there. So I would,

02:28:08.040 --> 02:28:14.360
I need to go back and say hello. It's been far too long. I need to go. New York is so much fun.

02:28:14.360 --> 02:28:20.120
Oh my God. Well, you need to go see mistress Tia because I love that bitch. If people will send me

02:28:20.120 --> 02:28:27.800
a ticket, I'll go. I'm not even playing. That's not how it works. Yeah. Jamie's broke. All right.

02:28:27.800 --> 02:28:33.800
Uh, hold out for another one of those jet blue sales, man. They go cheap sometimes. Well,

02:28:33.800 --> 02:28:38.120
we got enough listeners out there that they could send us tickets. You know, I don't see why they

02:28:38.120 --> 02:28:42.920
don't. Yeah, but then you owe them something. Well, of course we do do this show. I don't know.

02:28:42.920 --> 02:28:46.680
I don't know. I just, I feel weird asking for money from listeners. You know how I am.

02:28:46.680 --> 02:28:51.720
All right. Uh, let's see. I got a couple of tweets from a tiger claw. I think I already,

02:28:51.720 --> 02:28:56.520
we already touched on the one from GameStop doing the streaming things, but how about this one? I

02:28:56.520 --> 02:29:01.240
like this, uh, about the video game history museum. I didn't even know they were trying

02:29:01.240 --> 02:29:06.680
to do this. Is this the whole, like the home of video games and whatever it is something,

02:29:06.680 --> 02:29:14.440
something Iowa or whatever, Iowa. I don't know. Uh, let's see. Uh, it's a lengthy article from

02:29:14.440 --> 02:29:18.360
Gama Sutra and I didn't read this in advance, so gosh, I don't even know where to start here. We

02:29:18.360 --> 02:29:22.520
are still seeing calls by the way, orange launch radio on Skype. Uh, Oh, it's ringing right now.

02:29:22.520 --> 02:29:26.680
Good. That'll give me time to skim this article. Hi. You're on orange launch radio. Who's this?

02:29:26.680 --> 02:29:30.520
It's a Brad from pod culture. Hey, Brad from pod culture. What's on your mind, buddy?

02:29:30.520 --> 02:29:36.520
Oh, not a whole lot. Uh, finally joined the contingent and picked up a 3d last week.

02:29:38.280 --> 02:29:43.400
Was this after the price drop? I'm assuming. Yeah. Ah. And how was it? Um, you know,

02:29:43.400 --> 02:29:49.400
it's actually a pretty neat little system. I'm actually digging it. Not much in the way of games

02:29:49.400 --> 02:29:54.280
out yet though. No, there's not. Is there something you're looking forward to that's coming out?

02:29:55.080 --> 02:29:58.600
Uh, no, no. I'm pretty satisfied with the two that I've gotten right now.

02:29:59.720 --> 02:30:07.640
DOA dimensions and, uh, bridge rates are 3d. Nice. A lot, a lot of, uh, 3d boobies and DOA,

02:30:07.640 --> 02:30:15.240
uh, I'm sure I've always liked the DOA franchise. Hmm. A lot of guys do. Uh, let me ask you this.

02:30:15.240 --> 02:30:23.480
What, what kind of made you decide to take the plunge? The fact that the, uh, evil G had the,

02:30:23.480 --> 02:30:28.760
if you're one of the power rewards members or whatever the hell membership thing that they got,

02:30:28.760 --> 02:30:35.000
uh, if you trade in a DS light, you pick it up and 99 bucks. Oh, okay. So you did the whole,

02:30:35.000 --> 02:30:40.760
like the evil G. I like that by the way, the evil G, uh, uh, I had a true story. This is not going

02:30:40.760 --> 02:30:43.720
to make sense to anyone, but I just have to say this because you know, some teachers that you

02:30:43.720 --> 02:30:49.320
have in your past stay with you forever. And I had an awesome, awesome music teacher, uh, in,

02:30:49.320 --> 02:30:53.400
uh, junior high school and his name was Mr. Gonzalez, but everybody called him Mr. G. Like

02:30:53.400 --> 02:30:57.480
that was the name he went by for short. And, uh, he, he's a great, oh man, I wish I knew what he

02:30:57.480 --> 02:31:00.920
was up to these days. I wonder if he's still teaching, but anyhow, when you say evil G,

02:31:01.560 --> 02:31:05.800
like for whatever reason that just triggers a response in my mind where I see his evil twin.

02:31:08.120 --> 02:31:13.000
You know what I mean? So, but I like that as a name for GameStop evil G. All right. So,

02:31:13.000 --> 02:31:17.560
so you, you, you bought into the evil G's, uh, trade in scheme, which is, I can't fault you

02:31:17.560 --> 02:31:21.320
for a good deal. So it's, it's fine. And that's, that's what made you finally take the plunge.

02:31:22.200 --> 02:31:25.720
Oh yeah, definitely. Um, I had thought about picking one up when they came out, but

02:31:26.520 --> 02:31:32.840
250 bucks. That was a, that's a little much when you can pick up one for about a hundred bucks.

02:31:32.840 --> 02:31:37.640
Oh yeah. And concerned. In fact, that's what I paid for my DS light. Yeah.

02:31:37.640 --> 02:31:41.880
So what did you think about, we had a call a little bit ago that was talking about,

02:31:41.880 --> 02:31:47.560
I don't really use my portable game systems portably. Do you find that your gaming habits

02:31:47.560 --> 02:31:52.040
are similar or do you think that you might actually get more use out of this on the go?

02:31:52.600 --> 02:31:56.600
Um, I'm interested to take it, taking it to DragonCon and see what I can do with the street

02:31:56.600 --> 02:32:03.480
pass function. You'll get a ton there. I'm sure I can't even imagine my ass is sitting on the couch.

02:32:05.800 --> 02:32:11.000
I see. So you're couch surfing and playing the 3DS. That's fine. That's a lot of,

02:32:11.000 --> 02:32:15.240
a lot of folks. No, Bobby, I didn't steal your name for GameStop.

02:32:16.760 --> 02:32:22.040
Bobby, Bobby's throwing a tantrum in chat right now, Brad, you need to go address this.

02:32:25.560 --> 02:32:28.840
He's just mad because his tiny citizens are revolting because, are

02:32:28.840 --> 02:32:31.640
revolting. Yeah. Because they don't want his tower to get bigger than mine, but anyway,

02:32:31.640 --> 02:32:38.920
they stink on ice. Uh, so Brad, there's some new games coming out for the 3DS this holiday.

02:32:38.920 --> 02:32:44.520
Uh, there's the, um, new Mario game, the new Mario Kart game. Any of this stuff look interesting?

02:32:44.520 --> 02:32:48.120
Oh, well, I like the, I like Mario Kart, so that's definitely worth a look.

02:32:49.320 --> 02:32:55.720
May pick that up. Absolutely. I think it is going to be worth picking up. So, well, I hope you have

02:32:55.720 --> 02:33:00.120
a lot of fun at DragonCon and I hope you are able to street pass with tons and tons of people.

02:33:00.120 --> 02:33:04.840
Uh, and I hope you win lots of awards that I hear you're nominated for that apparently

02:33:04.840 --> 02:33:10.360
Bobby was not, hence some of the tantrum that's going on in there, but that's okay.

02:33:10.360 --> 02:33:14.840
We weren't nominated either. Uh, you were nominated. Were we?

02:33:15.560 --> 02:33:22.280
You didn't make, make it as a finalist, I don't think. Oh, well. Pretty sure you were nominated.

02:33:22.280 --> 02:33:25.320
I don't know. I didn't see any emails on it this year, but oh, well, it's all good.

02:33:26.200 --> 02:33:32.440
I ain't mad. So, well, you know, but, uh, yeah, it's, uh, you know, if you can get in on the deal

02:33:32.440 --> 02:33:36.280
for the 3DS, I'd tell people, you know, go ahead and check it out. It's a, it's a lot of fun.

02:33:37.080 --> 02:33:41.320
All right. Sounds good. Another raging raving endorsement for the 3DS. All right. Well,

02:33:41.320 --> 02:33:44.360
Brad, buddy, we're gonna let you go. So we wrap things up, but thanks so much for the call.

02:33:44.360 --> 02:33:49.880
All right. Later guys. Later. All right. So I had a little more time to read the article there in

02:33:49.880 --> 02:33:53.160
between, um, some of the conversation there. And by the way, that's going to do it for the

02:33:53.160 --> 02:33:56.760
Skypline tonight. Thanks to those that called to those that didn't get through. Sorry. Maybe next

02:33:56.760 --> 02:34:01.160
time. Uh, anyhow, or you can send us emails, of course, mailbag at orange launch radio.com.

02:34:01.160 --> 02:34:07.240
Remember, we need, uh, 10 emails for the Mexican Fiesta drinking party, uh, to happen here on the

02:34:07.240 --> 02:34:14.040
show. And we're talking horchata, not tequila. Um, let's see. Apparently these guys want to set up

02:34:14.040 --> 02:34:17.720
some type of like collectible museum. It's the guys that are behind the Classic Gaming Expo.

02:34:17.720 --> 02:34:23.960
This is all a tweet to a story on a gamasutra that Tiger Claw sent us via Twitter. Uh, apparently

02:34:23.960 --> 02:34:28.360
there are these guys, they're the folks behind Classic Gaming Expo. They've got a collection

02:34:28.360 --> 02:34:33.560
of 30,000 items that they want to put into a permanent official home where folks can like

02:34:33.560 --> 02:34:39.000
research document and so forth, but they need $30,000 to set up the base in Silicon Valley.

02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:43.160
And they got less than two weeks to go to do it and they don't even have half of the money that

02:34:43.160 --> 02:34:48.280
they need to do it. So it's not looking too good. And I guess a lot of the backers just don't have

02:34:48.280 --> 02:34:52.360
an idea where the money is going and you know, I guess what they're going to get out of it,

02:34:52.360 --> 02:34:58.200
so to speak. Um, so some of the collection shows off at trade shows and all that stuff.

02:34:58.200 --> 02:35:04.360
So they want to do it, but it sounds like they may not hit it. That's too bad. It would be nice

02:35:04.360 --> 02:35:10.280
to have a video game museum of sorts and Silicon Valley definitely is a much more logical place

02:35:10.280 --> 02:35:18.680
to put it than whatever the fuck Iowa. Uh, but, um, yeah, I can see where they're having problems

02:35:18.680 --> 02:35:23.480
selling an idea like that. Like what they might want to do is maybe try to have it as like an

02:35:23.480 --> 02:35:29.160
expansion to some type of a museum that already exists that speaks to nerds interests. Like one

02:35:29.160 --> 02:35:34.520
really cool place I went to last year was the sci-fi museum in Seattle, which is attached to

02:35:34.520 --> 02:35:38.840
the experience music project, which is a neat little museum. Like maybe there's a place in that

02:35:38.840 --> 02:35:43.640
whole thing that they could fit a video game tribute into, you know, that, that might be the

02:35:43.640 --> 02:35:51.080
way to do it. I know San Jose has a technology museum. That's pretty awesome. Maybe that's the

02:35:51.080 --> 02:35:57.560
way to do it. All right. Uh, there you go. That's going to do it for another show. But first I need

02:35:57.560 --> 02:36:03.560
to make sure last minute stories. Yes. No, maybe so. I'm just dropping grenades on ants. Oh, so

02:36:03.560 --> 02:36:07.160
you're too busy fighting insects to do last minute stories. That's fine. It's cool. Well, we have

02:36:07.160 --> 02:36:12.680
some last minute stories that can talk about them if you want. Yes, please. Let's. Um, well, let's

02:36:12.680 --> 02:36:17.160
see. There's a couple of music games coming out this fall and we can talk a little bit about what

02:36:17.160 --> 02:36:23.720
tracks will be featured in said games. Um, starting with, of course, dance central to the announced

02:36:23.720 --> 02:36:30.200
initial song list, including some of the songs. Um, was it sexy chick by David Guetta and a con,

02:36:30.200 --> 02:36:36.600
uh, daddy Yankee featuring Fergie with impacto, the rude with sandstorm. That's pretty funny. Oh,

02:36:36.600 --> 02:36:44.600
goodie. Uh, death punk with techno logic. Um, Bruno, Bruno Mars with grenade, uh, ozone with,

02:36:44.600 --> 02:36:52.600
uh, was it, uh, drag us? Dragostea, uh, dente. That's the new manuma song. Yes. You know,

02:36:53.400 --> 02:36:54.760
remember the guy sitting in his chair?

02:37:02.520 --> 02:37:08.360
Donna summers with hot stuff. Uh, Gnarls Barkley with run, uh, Lena with satellite,

02:37:08.360 --> 02:37:16.760
uh, and Ricky and glee is, uh, with, I like it, uh, lady Gaga with born this way. Yes.

02:37:17.800 --> 02:37:25.240
Exile with I wish for you and, uh, Florida with, uh, David Guetta club can't handle me.

02:37:26.440 --> 02:37:31.320
It's a pretty good mix of songs. I like that. Uh, and it's supposed to, you do all the dance

02:37:31.320 --> 02:37:36.280
central one stuff like import, like the rock band series, right? That's awesome. And then of course,

02:37:36.280 --> 02:37:41.560
just dance three will be coming out, um, actually almost around the same time. We're talking like

02:37:41.560 --> 02:37:48.920
a week apart. Um, so they have, I don't know, I don't think it's a full list, but damn 46 tracks

02:37:48.920 --> 02:37:53.320
so far. I'm not going to go through all of them, but, uh, some of the classic stuff too unlimited

02:37:53.320 --> 02:38:01.000
with no limit. Uh, aha would take on me. Um, banana Ramo with visa or Venus. Uh, but I have

02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:04.920
some new stuff in there though. I see LMFAO and the party rock Anthem. That's like a big song

02:38:04.920 --> 02:38:11.400
right now. That is pretty cool. Um, the cover of boogie wonderland looks like, uh, Katy Perry with

02:38:11.400 --> 02:38:19.880
California girls. Alan will be so happy to hear that he loves Katy Perry. Uh, I like Mika. I see

02:38:19.880 --> 02:38:23.880
Mika's in there. That's good. So it's a pretty round set list that is that they're saying that

02:38:23.880 --> 02:38:27.880
may not be the whole thing. I don't know if that's the whole thing. Hmm. Is that for the,

02:38:27.880 --> 02:38:35.240
we and the PS3 and three. So it is going to be on all of them this time. Yes. Nice. So, um,

02:38:35.960 --> 02:38:41.960
yeah, that's, uh, interesting. And they even have crazy little thing called love by queen.

02:38:43.720 --> 02:38:48.280
Queen songs are good or scissor sisters. I don't feel like dancing. That's a fun song.

02:38:48.280 --> 02:38:50.440
I always, that song for some reason makes me think of the Muppets.

02:38:52.440 --> 02:38:54.920
It must be that one performance they did at the Brit awards. I don't know.

02:38:54.920 --> 02:38:59.160
All right. So that'd be a good, good one. I guess. I guess the music's very important

02:38:59.160 --> 02:39:04.440
to a dancing. I've never played just dance, but people seem to really like it. It's very similar,

02:39:04.440 --> 02:39:10.360
kind of a little bit like dance masters, but less, it gives you a little bit of an idea of what

02:39:10.360 --> 02:39:15.640
you're supposed to do. Like they have kind of, it's still kind of following on screen, but there's

02:39:15.640 --> 02:39:22.280
not that many cues to it. Okay. But it's, it's a lot more than dance masters where dance masters

02:39:22.280 --> 02:39:26.360
doesn't give you any cues whatsoever. Well, it's going to be fun to watch these two games have a

02:39:26.360 --> 02:39:31.800
showdown. Yeah. No dance masters this year. Too bad. What a shock. I know.

02:39:33.960 --> 02:39:39.800
Um, connectimals is coming to a windows 7 phone this fall. That's kind of weird.

02:39:41.240 --> 02:39:45.880
SSX looks awesome. They were showing off some of the events that they can feature, including

02:39:45.880 --> 02:39:53.720
a hundred thousand, um, player events. Uh, so that's gonna be really cool. And, um, yeah,

02:39:53.720 --> 02:39:59.720
that's it. All right. Well, that's gonna start to close the book on another week here at orange

02:39:59.720 --> 02:40:03.960
lounge radio, but we can't call it a show until we go around and get everybody's final thought.

02:40:03.960 --> 02:40:07.640
So dark soccer, your final thought for us tonight. I have good friends.

02:40:09.560 --> 02:40:11.560
My final thought is Jamie has good friends.

02:40:11.560 --> 02:40:17.320
Loki. Your final thought tonight is I got to cut back on expenses a lot.

02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:22.600
Uh, thank you guys so much for downloading orange launch radio and tuning into us. Uh,

02:40:22.600 --> 02:40:26.760
thank you for supporting independent podcasting. If you like what you hear, remember we don't ask

02:40:26.760 --> 02:40:31.000
for your money to do this program. We do it for free just cause you know, it's a way to kill a

02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:35.560
Sunday night. Just tell a friend about the show. Help us spread the word about orange lounge radio.

02:40:35.560 --> 02:40:40.360
That's all we ask. Uh, leave us a nice five star review on iTunes or whatever website it is that

02:40:40.360 --> 02:40:45.240
you found this podcast on. You would not believe how much a little word spreading can go. We really

02:40:45.240 --> 02:40:49.880
appreciate it. Um, so that's going to do it. We're not here next week. Sorry guys. The show's

02:40:49.880 --> 02:40:54.120
going to last you for two weeks. If you are tuning in live next week though, there's a new

02:40:54.120 --> 02:40:59.000
OLR best of, um, I actually don't have anything to do with those. The dark Tetsuya has been

02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:03.080
spearheading those. So, uh, that's all going to, I don't even know what's going to be in it. So

02:41:03.080 --> 02:41:09.160
I will tell you though that a lot of the stuff he, at least the first one was all really old stuff.

02:41:09.160 --> 02:41:13.320
So for those folks that are like, what did OLR sound like nine years ago? If you really want to

02:41:13.320 --> 02:41:16.520
subject yourself to it, cause it was a much different show then, uh, best stuff is a good

02:41:16.520 --> 02:41:20.920
way to do it. It will not be on the podcast feed. It will only be live. You must, must tune in live

02:41:20.920 --> 02:41:24.680
to hear it. Uh, might be up for download on the website later if we're in a good mood, but it

02:41:24.680 --> 02:41:29.560
won't be on the podcast feed. Sorry. It's just, it's a special thing. Sorry. Sorry kids. So, um,

02:41:30.200 --> 02:41:33.880
that's it though. That's going to do it. Have a great week, two weeks, everybody,

02:41:33.880 --> 02:41:39.080
and, uh, we'll see you back here. Labor day weekend with more of orange launch radio. Good night.

02:42:03.880 --> 02:42:09.080
Or all games.com, but we're probably right. Anyway, see you next week.
