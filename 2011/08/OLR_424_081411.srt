00:00:13,891 --> 00:00:25,056
[SPEAKER_03]: Tonight, August 14th, 2011, a patent possibly spills new details on the Wii U controller, games finally arrive on Google+, and Australia gets a new rating for graphic games.

2
00:00:31,567 --> 00:00:36,169
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

3
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:38,010
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:42,092
[SPEAKER_04]: We are live on this lovely Sunday evening, August the 14th of 2011.

5
00:00:43,233 --> 00:00:49,036
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Rob Roberts and with me as always, say hello to the one, the only, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

6
00:00:49,156 --> 00:00:49,436
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.

7
00:00:49,676 --> 00:00:50,496
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you, Jamie Summers?

8
00:00:50,937 --> 00:00:51,297
[SPEAKER_04]: Burpee.

9
00:00:51,637 --> 00:00:52,077
[SPEAKER_04]: Burpee?

10
00:00:52,297 --> 00:00:52,958
[SPEAKER_04]: A little gassy?

11
00:00:53,658 --> 00:00:54,679
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been drinking root beer.

12
00:00:54,759 --> 00:00:55,499
[SPEAKER_04]: Having a root beer.

13
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:56,499
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

14
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,240
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, it's episode 424 tonight.

15
00:01:00,248 --> 00:01:02,110
[SPEAKER_04]: 424.

16
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:02,110
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a palindrome episode.

17
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:03,031
[SPEAKER_02]: Quite.

18
00:01:03,611 --> 00:01:04,833
[SPEAKER_02]: Like dad and mom.

19
00:01:06,054 --> 00:01:06,715
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

20
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:10,599
[SPEAKER_04]: Other words.

21
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,402
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a palindrome, but maybe a prime number.

22
00:01:13,442 --> 00:01:13,923
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure.

23
00:01:14,003 --> 00:01:15,264
[SPEAKER_04]: Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

24
00:01:15,304 --> 00:01:17,226
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't worry, we'll end the same way as we began.

25
00:01:17,326 --> 00:01:17,687
[SPEAKER_06]: Terrible.

26
00:01:20,402 --> 00:01:24,687
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, inevitably when the show ends someday, it will end the same way it began.

27
00:01:24,707 --> 00:01:25,869
[SPEAKER_06]: We're just talking about tonight.

28
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:33,018
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, Loki will have to do the last episode in one of those cheap little $5 microphones.

29
00:01:33,658 --> 00:01:35,421
[SPEAKER_04]: What was that microphone we had on the first episode?

30
00:01:35,441 --> 00:01:35,941
[SPEAKER_04]: It was terrible.

31
00:01:35,981 --> 00:01:37,203
[SPEAKER_04]: You sounded like you were coming through a phone.

32
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,722
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe it was a piece of foam wire attached to a paper cup.

33
00:01:41,862 --> 00:01:42,743
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, something like that.

34
00:01:42,763 --> 00:01:45,264
[SPEAKER_04]: It was two Dixie cups and a string, actually, I think is what he was using.

35
00:01:45,684 --> 00:01:51,687
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, anyhow, usually we start off the show with how was your gaming week, but I got to start this off tonight because this is some big drama.

36
00:01:51,707 --> 00:01:52,287
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, here's a word.

37
00:01:52,968 --> 00:01:53,128
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

38
00:01:53,748 --> 00:01:54,568
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to hear about words.

39
00:01:54,588 --> 00:01:55,829
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to tell you about my drams.

40
00:01:56,229 --> 00:01:56,889
[SPEAKER_02]: Ibophobia.

41
00:01:57,569 --> 00:01:58,010
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that?

42
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:58,950
[SPEAKER_04]: Fear of palindromes?

43
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:00,911
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, no.

44
00:02:01,971 --> 00:02:03,291
[SPEAKER_02]: A dog, a plan, a connection.

45
00:02:03,311 --> 00:02:04,432
[SPEAKER_04]: You are so random.

46
00:02:04,532 --> 00:02:04,792
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

47
00:02:05,152 --> 00:02:06,552
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, is the word itself a palindrome?

48
00:02:06,572 --> 00:02:06,993
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it is.

49
00:02:07,213 --> 00:02:07,653
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

50
00:02:07,673 --> 00:02:10,554
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, what the hell are you just spouting off random words for?

51
00:02:10,754 --> 00:02:12,334
[SPEAKER_04]: Are we playing Balderdash tonight?

52
00:02:12,594 --> 00:02:13,675
[SPEAKER_02]: Was I not aware?

53
00:02:13,695 --> 00:02:14,635
[SPEAKER_02]: And so is Deleveled.

54
00:02:16,414 --> 00:02:17,595
[SPEAKER_04]: Deleveled is a palindrome.

55
00:02:17,835 --> 00:02:18,115
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

56
00:02:19,256 --> 00:02:20,396
[SPEAKER_04]: And as our chat room.

57
00:02:20,697 --> 00:02:21,617
[SPEAKER_04]: God, I love the chatters.

58
00:02:21,897 --> 00:02:23,939
[SPEAKER_04]: Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

59
00:02:24,359 --> 00:02:24,919
[SPEAKER_04]: Always present.

60
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:26,120
[SPEAKER_04]: Fourth guest on our show.

61
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,481
[SPEAKER_04]: Chat with us live.

62
00:02:28,241 --> 00:02:31,223
[SPEAKER_04]: And Alpha Cananogram starts us off tonight reminding us of another palindrome.

63
00:02:31,263 --> 00:02:33,044
[SPEAKER_04]: He says, also, boob.

64
00:02:34,005 --> 00:02:34,205
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

65
00:02:34,345 --> 00:02:37,667
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently, ibophobia is an irrational fear of palindromes.

66
00:02:38,843 --> 00:03:01,822
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, look, I gotta tell about my dramas Okay, dramas And I just mentioned this to you guys before the show started But you haven't really heard all the details yet So, okay, here's what's going on So you know how everybody's all up in arms Like, oh my gosh, PlayStation 3 Our information all got stolen Sony's in deep shit And needs to give us all Years of credit protection And all this stuff, right?

67
00:03:01,862 --> 00:03:05,925
[SPEAKER_04]: Yet we haven't really heard of any cases of people actually getting their information stolen On the PlayStation 3, right?

68
00:03:06,025 --> 00:03:06,206
[SPEAKER_04]: Right

69
00:03:06,806 --> 00:03:12,731
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, well I didn't have information on the PlayStation 3 stolen, but I had $125 charged on my Xbox Live account last night.

70
00:03:13,172 --> 00:03:13,412
[SPEAKER_04]: Bleh.

71
00:03:14,409 --> 00:03:18,092
[SPEAKER_04]: So while everything... And by the way, I'm not the first person to have that happen.

72
00:03:18,672 --> 00:03:22,695
[SPEAKER_04]: It's happened to one of my friends who hasn't even really played Xbox in like a year.

73
00:03:23,055 --> 00:03:30,119
[SPEAKER_04]: It's happened to another guy I know on Twitter who I know well from seeing it like E3 and he's a listener of the show and so forth.

74
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,322
[SPEAKER_04]: And I want to say I've solved one other case on Facebook as well.

75
00:03:33,662 --> 00:03:36,624
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not an isolated thing.

76
00:03:37,024 --> 00:03:39,826
[SPEAKER_04]: Folks are having their Xbox Live accounts hacked.

77
00:03:40,126 --> 00:03:40,947
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

78
00:04:02,364 --> 00:04:03,785
[SPEAKER_04]: So I wanted to sign on and play it today.

79
00:04:03,845 --> 00:04:07,748
[SPEAKER_04]: I played it last night for a little bit and I wanted to play it today before the show so I could give you more thoughts on it.

80
00:04:08,228 --> 00:04:18,935
[SPEAKER_04]: When I tried to sign into my account on Xbox Live, it told me that the profile information was corrupt and needed to be resynced or it needed to be redownloaded from Xbox Live.

81
00:04:18,975 --> 00:04:24,899
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically the same pop-up you get if you ever have played on somebody else's Xbox.

82
00:04:25,339 --> 00:04:29,202
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you have to download your data to be able to play on that other person's Xbox.

83
00:04:29,622 --> 00:04:40,071
[SPEAKER_04]: So that told me my information had been downloaded to another Xbox, except for the fact that I had just played Shadow Planet last night, and I hadn't played on any other Xboxes since then, I think I would know.

84
00:04:40,411 --> 00:04:44,935
[SPEAKER_04]: The only Xbox I really used to do that with was Alan's when I used to drive when he lived in the Bay Area.

85
00:04:45,295 --> 00:04:48,357
[SPEAKER_04]: I would go down there, transfer my info for the weekend, then come home, transfer it back.

86
00:04:48,377 --> 00:04:49,678
[SPEAKER_04]: I hadn't done that in months, you know.

87
00:04:50,479 --> 00:05:00,572
[SPEAKER_04]: So that told me something was wrong, and instantly the first thing that came to my mind was, wait a minute, I saw Justin tweet about this like two days ago, his information got hacked, I'm gonna go check my bank account right now.

88
00:05:00,892 --> 00:05:05,638
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what made me think to look, sure enough, I look at my bank account, there's two charges on it, one for $79.99, one for $49.99, both from Xbox Live.

89
00:05:08,301 --> 00:05:13,882
[SPEAKER_04]: and I go into my Xbox Live account and somebody had bought a gold pack, premium pack.

90
00:05:14,002 --> 00:05:18,243
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even know what game it was for because by the time I saw that I was already on the phone with Xbox.com.

91
00:05:18,623 --> 00:05:20,084
[SPEAKER_04]: The good news was I was able to get right through.

92
00:05:20,124 --> 00:05:22,124
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't have to wait on hold for a half hour or anything.

93
00:05:22,504 --> 00:05:31,186
[SPEAKER_04]: Talked to a lady there who was fairly helpful but one thing that struck me as kind of odd that she told me was that, oh yeah, I got hit for $350 too.

94
00:05:31,726 --> 00:05:35,787
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, so a fifth person who works for Microsoft also got hit.

95
00:05:37,321 --> 00:05:39,008
[SPEAKER_04]: and we're all mad at Sony, why?

96
00:05:43,638 --> 00:05:49,723
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I understand why we're mad at Sony, but something tells me we need to be a little irritated with Microsoft right now.

97
00:05:49,923 --> 00:05:58,410
[SPEAKER_04]: Either somehow information got compromised or there's something out there siphoning our information and they are currently getting all of our passwords.

98
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:06,696
[SPEAKER_04]: So my advice to you, you need to stop what you're doing right now and go change your password on Xbox.com because if you haven't, you're at risk for this.

99
00:06:06,876 --> 00:06:10,199
[SPEAKER_04]: So don't come crying to me when they take $125 from you because it's going to suck.

100
00:06:12,069 --> 00:06:13,230
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to suck for them because I don't have $125.

101
00:06:15,733 --> 00:06:20,077
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a lot of folks that are saying, I'm going to a chatroom, chat.orangeandre.com.

102
00:06:20,537 --> 00:06:23,460
[SPEAKER_04]: Sickman says, I prefer buying things with cash and this is why.

103
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,463
[SPEAKER_04]: TigerClaw says, Sky, this is why I use the Xbox Live cards.

104
00:06:26,503 --> 00:06:27,604
[SPEAKER_04]: I never put a credit card.

105
00:06:28,384 --> 00:06:28,605
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

106
00:06:29,105 --> 00:06:32,748
[SPEAKER_04]: That's nice to do in retrospect, but let's face it, I didn't do that.

107
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:44,055
[SPEAKER_04]: Microsoft doesn't exactly make it easy either to do things that way, especially once they have your credit card from an Xbox Live account that I had set up for gold many years ago.

108
00:06:44,255 --> 00:06:48,838
[SPEAKER_02]: I've only had one card on the Xbox account, and it's been expired now for four years.

109
00:06:48,938 --> 00:06:51,360
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you want to take it off, I think you have to call to get it removed.

110
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,621
[SPEAKER_04]: It's ridiculous.

111
00:06:53,641 --> 00:06:55,243
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a pain in the ass.

112
00:06:55,263 --> 00:06:57,304
[SPEAKER_02]: They wouldn't be able to use it anyway because it's expired.

113
00:06:58,124 --> 00:06:58,925
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've never renewed it.

114
00:06:59,225 --> 00:07:10,877
[SPEAKER_04]: Something's coming for Microsoft because I'm telling you this is happening more and more and it's not going to stop with just me and the people I've spoke about unless miraculously we've convinced the entire internet to change their passwords.

115
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:16,943
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to keep happening and I kind of think Microsoft needs to speak up a little bit about what's going on.

116
00:07:16,983 --> 00:07:22,388
[SPEAKER_04]: If nothing else, they should be putting out some bulletins about security alerts because this is just more work for them.

117
00:07:23,149 --> 00:07:30,393
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to tell you this, by the way, as well, which is really important, is that the whole process for them to investigate is going to take 21 days.

118
00:07:30,793 --> 00:07:33,435
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm not going to see that money back for 21 days.

119
00:07:34,035 --> 00:07:37,057
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, luckily, I'm gainfully employed.

120
00:07:37,417 --> 00:07:38,618
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a savings account.

121
00:07:39,038 --> 00:07:41,499
[SPEAKER_04]: I can cover the loss of that money for 21 days.

122
00:07:41,939 --> 00:07:42,740
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't affect me.

123
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,901
[SPEAKER_04]: But I know we have a lot of college kids that listen to the show.

124
00:07:44,921 --> 00:07:47,643
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like, I don't even have $125 for them to steal.

125
00:07:48,263 --> 00:07:51,785
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm just warning you, do something about it.

126
00:07:52,125 --> 00:08:13,495
[SPEAKER_04]: I have thought about calling the bank but I thought at the end of the day ironically enough my card expires next month so I was kind of thinking like you know why go through all that hassle when I'm going to be getting a new card anyway and it's just kind of like if you start flagging all the Microsoft transactions as suspect then that's probably going to give me more headache in the future

127
00:08:13,675 --> 00:08:14,436
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

128
00:08:28,954 --> 00:08:32,196
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to go through anyway, and you're going to have to deal with overdraft charges on top of it.

129
00:08:32,496 --> 00:08:32,676
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

130
00:08:32,796 --> 00:08:39,860
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, the good thing is most banks have a protection thing, and, you know, it's at least there's a way to have it investigated.

131
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,561
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's just the whole thing is frustrating.

132
00:08:41,601 --> 00:08:47,745
[SPEAKER_04]: And just, you know, once again, knowing that someone has stolen my information is kind of crappy.

133
00:08:47,825 --> 00:08:48,885
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a crappy feeling.

134
00:08:48,905 --> 00:08:50,506
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no other way to explain it.

135
00:08:50,806 --> 00:08:54,809
[SPEAKER_04]: And the reason why I say once again, I had my Warcraft account hacked about...

136
00:08:55,689 --> 00:08:56,150
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

137
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:20,952
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, it kind of ruined WoW for me for a little while.

138
00:09:20,972 --> 00:09:22,853
[SPEAKER_04]: When I came back to WoW, I rolled a new character.

139
00:09:23,374 --> 00:09:27,496
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't touched that character since that whole incident three some odd years ago.

140
00:09:28,017 --> 00:09:33,000
[SPEAKER_04]: So, learn from my mistake, I guess, although I don't think I made a mistake.

141
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:44,727
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, with Warcraft, I'm pretty internet savvy and I don't log into a lot of suspicious stuff, but my ex was not internet savvy and I did play WoW on his computer, so I think I know how I got compromised there.

142
00:09:45,067 --> 00:09:47,369
[SPEAKER_04]: But this, I'm having a really hard time figuring it out.

143
00:09:53,417 --> 00:09:55,886
[SPEAKER_02]: How many other systems have you at all played on?

144
00:09:57,458 --> 00:09:59,018
[SPEAKER_04]: Just Alan's.

145
00:09:59,779 --> 00:10:04,119
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe one of Loki's systems years ago, but that would be it.

146
00:10:04,239 --> 00:10:05,720
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, it would just be Alan's.

147
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,420
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems to me that it's a breach from within Microsoft.

148
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:13,682
[SPEAKER_04]: Or an old Xbox of mine that I would have given to Loki, but we wiped... No, because I had the old hard drive.

149
00:10:13,742 --> 00:10:15,462
[SPEAKER_04]: It wouldn't have the information because I have the old hard drive.

150
00:10:16,002 --> 00:10:18,242
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have any hard drive zeros anyways.

151
00:10:18,322 --> 00:10:22,143
[SPEAKER_06]: All the systems I have, like I said, I don't have the hard drives.

152
00:10:22,223 --> 00:10:25,244
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it seems to me that it's something from internal...

153
00:10:26,989 --> 00:10:30,552
[SPEAKER_06]: And once again, it wouldn't matter anyways, even if your profile's on there, unless I knew your password, it wouldn't matter.

154
00:10:32,293 --> 00:10:47,327
[SPEAKER_06]: And I mean, in that case, all you would really need to know is the email address that you used for your account and the password, basically the live.com login details, and then you recover your profile that way.

155
00:10:47,827 --> 00:10:48,067
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

156
00:10:49,705 --> 00:10:51,787
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a bummer, but yeah, that happened.

157
00:10:51,847 --> 00:10:54,109
[SPEAKER_04]: So just kind of a heads up warning to folks.

158
00:10:54,509 --> 00:10:58,953
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, now I'm out that money, but luckily I have money in savings.

159
00:10:58,993 --> 00:11:00,614
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just going to transfer over to cover it.

160
00:11:00,654 --> 00:11:02,436
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not too big of a deal for me.

161
00:11:02,576 --> 00:11:08,121
[SPEAKER_04]: Thankfully, I have a savings, but I just don't want to see it happen to many more people because it's a shitty feeling.

162
00:11:08,161 --> 00:11:10,122
[SPEAKER_04]: And I kind of want to know how it happened.

163
00:11:10,182 --> 00:11:10,923
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you want to know.

164
00:11:11,303 --> 00:11:13,285
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, somebody's trying to steal money from me?

165
00:11:13,385 --> 00:11:13,745
[SPEAKER_04]: Who is it?

166
00:11:13,785 --> 00:11:14,626
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to kick their ass.

167
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:16,387
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I want to know right now, so...

168
00:11:17,108 --> 00:11:18,670
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess we'll see what happens.

169
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:20,031
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's not just me, you guys.

170
00:11:20,672 --> 00:11:22,314
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys are probably seeing it on your Facebooks too.

171
00:11:22,354 --> 00:11:33,626
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, if you do a search on Google for hacked Xbox Live account and search for the past week, there's plenty of links for people saying, hey, my account's been hacked.

172
00:11:35,293 --> 00:11:35,553
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

173
00:11:36,834 --> 00:11:38,215
[SPEAKER_04]: Bobby just sent me a private message.

174
00:11:38,235 --> 00:11:40,797
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to say who it was, but he knows somebody else that got hit for $100.

175
00:11:41,837 --> 00:11:44,079
[SPEAKER_04]: So, good gosh.

176
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:47,441
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not isolating, you guys.

177
00:11:47,461 --> 00:11:48,502
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I'm bringing it up.

178
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:52,984
[SPEAKER_04]: We've all been panicking about Sony, Sony, Sony, Sony, but nothing ended up happening with that data.

179
00:11:53,024 --> 00:11:54,205
[SPEAKER_04]: Not to say nothing ever will.

180
00:11:54,465 --> 00:11:55,586
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't sit on your laurels.

181
00:11:55,906 --> 00:11:58,708
[SPEAKER_04]: Make sure everything's been changed and your passwords are up to date there, too.

182
00:11:58,728 --> 00:12:02,811
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm just saying, if you thought Microsoft was better, you're wrong.

183
00:12:04,096 --> 00:12:05,177
[SPEAKER_04]: Listen up, fanboys.

184
00:12:05,637 --> 00:12:08,899
[SPEAKER_04]: I got $125 stolen from my Xbox account today.

185
00:12:09,199 --> 00:12:11,781
[SPEAKER_04]: Microsoft is no better than Sony, I'm here to tell you.

186
00:12:14,283 --> 00:12:21,408
[SPEAKER_04]: So, that's what I wanted to just kick off tonight's show with, a lovely little warning that no company is immune from all of this data theft going on.

187
00:12:21,448 --> 00:12:24,149
[SPEAKER_04]: If there's money somewhere to steal, somebody is going to try to steal it.

188
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:26,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Doesn't matter what company it is.

189
00:12:27,805 --> 00:12:56,660
[SPEAKER_04]: on that note let's talk about your gaming week and the types of video games you've been playing this week I won't be able to play my by the way I can't sign into my account for 21 days they've suspended my account during the investigation which will take three weeks they say I can play offline stuff and what have you but most of the stuff I play is Xbox Live Arcade and I don't want my achievements to get screwed up so I basically won't be playing Xbox for the next three weeks so if you see me on in the next three weeks you might want to drop me an email because it's not me I won't be playing for the next three weeks PlayStation 3 here I come woo

190
00:12:58,024 --> 00:12:59,145
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

191
00:12:59,165 --> 00:13:08,492
[SPEAKER_04]: You should come over here and play Super Metroid Funny enough, I've been playing a Metroid very much like game this week, but I'll get to that in a minute DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

192
00:13:10,345 --> 00:13:14,086
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, and stupid freaking Tiny Tower.

193
00:13:15,006 --> 00:13:16,726
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking bitizens.

194
00:13:17,527 --> 00:13:18,507
[SPEAKER_02]: Ungrateful wretches.

195
00:13:20,847 --> 00:13:23,808
[SPEAKER_02]: And just a few things on Steam here and there.

196
00:13:24,728 --> 00:13:25,728
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, nothing major.

197
00:13:26,529 --> 00:13:27,589
[SPEAKER_02]: Just sort of, meh.

198
00:13:29,429 --> 00:13:29,969
[SPEAKER_02]: That's about it.

199
00:13:31,089 --> 00:13:32,970
[SPEAKER_02]: But Rebecca Black is level 70.

200
00:13:35,049 --> 00:13:35,870
[SPEAKER_04]: Congratulations.

201
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:37,151
[SPEAKER_04]: Fun, fun, fun, fun.

202
00:13:37,431 --> 00:13:38,512
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, gang fight.

203
00:13:38,852 --> 00:13:40,673
[SPEAKER_04]: Now who plays nothing but WoW?

204
00:13:40,693 --> 00:13:43,475
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very interesting how things have changed in a year.

205
00:13:43,675 --> 00:13:43,896
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey.

206
00:13:44,376 --> 00:13:47,999
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a look at some of these comments that are coming in from chat room about the hacking going on.

207
00:13:48,339 --> 00:13:55,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Xenacor in our chat room says, Remember, if Microsoft locks down your account, your games for Windows stuff will also be locked down, so check your Xbox Live now.

208
00:13:55,904 --> 00:14:00,528
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't play Dawn of War 2 offline because it requires a login.

209
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:00,728
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

210
00:14:01,468 --> 00:14:03,469
[SPEAKER_04]: Thankfully, I don't use Games for Windows.

211
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:04,130
[SPEAKER_04]: I use Steam.

212
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:05,270
[SPEAKER_04]: Nor does anyone else.

213
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:07,452
[SPEAKER_04]: I have used Game Room.

214
00:14:07,852 --> 00:14:09,553
[SPEAKER_04]: That's about the extent of it on Games for Windows.

215
00:14:09,673 --> 00:14:10,193
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh no!

216
00:14:10,713 --> 00:14:12,474
[SPEAKER_06]: Your Game Room games.

217
00:14:12,494 --> 00:14:15,036
[SPEAKER_06]: You won't be able to download any more Game Room games.

218
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:15,956
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh no.

219
00:14:16,797 --> 00:14:18,858
[SPEAKER_06]: All those releases that you're missing out on.

220
00:14:19,318 --> 00:14:20,058
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but I get it.

221
00:14:20,098 --> 00:14:24,559
[SPEAKER_04]: Xenocore saying Dawn of War 2 is tied into that, and I'm sure there's other games.

222
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,060
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have a story on it tonight.

223
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:32,902
[SPEAKER_04]: All these companies want to tie you into their online service, so if you're a fan of one of these games, you kind of get screwed.

224
00:14:32,982 --> 00:14:34,202
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you go.

225
00:14:35,142 --> 00:14:35,522
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

226
00:14:35,623 --> 00:14:37,023
[SPEAKER_04]: Going to other comments in chat.

227
00:14:37,743 --> 00:14:40,384
[SPEAKER_04]: Blackwolf clarifies he got hit while he was playing.

228
00:14:41,645 --> 00:14:45,648
[SPEAKER_04]: I only must have missed it by a couple hours because I was on last night and then I noticed it this morning.

229
00:14:46,729 --> 00:14:47,130
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

230
00:14:48,171 --> 00:14:52,815
[SPEAKER_04]: Sickman in our chatroom says, the only mistake you made, Sky, was buying Microsoft products.

231
00:14:53,275 --> 00:14:55,257
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the same mistake a lot of us have made.

232
00:14:55,898 --> 00:14:56,038
[SPEAKER_04]: But I

233
00:14:56,278 --> 00:14:57,738
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm sorry, that's stupid.

234
00:14:57,758 --> 00:14:59,199
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to play Shadow Planet.

235
00:14:59,319 --> 00:15:02,279
[SPEAKER_02]: That's actually probably the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.

236
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:07,321
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little bit fanboyish, but, you know, obviously there's some haters out there on Microsoft.

237
00:15:07,421 --> 00:15:07,961
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, come on.

238
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:11,982
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, PlayStation people can hate on Microsoft about network security.

239
00:15:12,302 --> 00:15:13,622
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on, you can't say shit.

240
00:15:13,742 --> 00:15:14,242
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

241
00:15:14,282 --> 00:15:17,583
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, Sony fanboys can't point and laugh at what's going on here.

242
00:15:17,623 --> 00:15:18,163
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't, but I'll...

243
00:15:20,844 --> 00:15:25,546
[SPEAKER_04]: My point to telling this story was Microsoft fans can't point and laugh at Sony.

244
00:15:25,767 --> 00:15:26,587
[SPEAKER_04]: You are not allowed.

245
00:15:27,727 --> 00:15:28,428
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm here to tell you.

246
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:34,090
[SPEAKER_04]: Because money was actually stolen in this case, you are not allowed to point and laugh at what's going on with Sony.

247
00:15:34,311 --> 00:15:43,275
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're not allowed to tell people that they can't, you know, this is what you get for supporting Sony or whatever bullshit I read on Twitter during that whole stuff going on.

248
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:46,177
[SPEAKER_04]: Ziba in chat says, I don't have any info on my Xbox account.

249
00:15:46,217 --> 00:15:47,138
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a silver account.

250
00:15:48,719 --> 00:15:54,544
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I said, my card is up in September, and I'm definitely having thoughts to keeping a card online now.

251
00:15:54,964 --> 00:15:56,365
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I might have learned my lesson.

252
00:15:56,886 --> 00:15:57,326
[SPEAKER_04]: IDK.

253
00:15:58,347 --> 00:16:04,912
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, if your card auto-renews, just be aware there's a whole lawsuit we'll get into probably later on about...

254
00:16:06,073 --> 00:16:06,634
[SPEAKER_04]: It won't matter.

255
00:16:06,754 --> 00:16:10,598
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll still try to charge it, and then when you put a new card on there, they'll charge it twice.

256
00:16:11,078 --> 00:16:11,919
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, jeez.

257
00:16:12,259 --> 00:16:15,263
[SPEAKER_04]: My card expires before Xbox Live does, so it won't matter.

258
00:16:16,204 --> 00:16:18,326
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, Loki, how was your gaming week?

259
00:16:19,484 --> 00:16:20,585
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm pretty good actually.

260
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:21,565
[SPEAKER_06]: I played lots of stuff.

261
00:16:22,205 --> 00:16:23,566
[SPEAKER_06]: I played Tiny Tower.

262
00:16:23,586 --> 00:16:30,228
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, I played it what I call the abridged version, which is I cheated the hell out of it and I finished the game completely.

263
00:16:30,888 --> 00:16:34,189
[SPEAKER_06]: I literally have built as much of the Tiny Tower as I possibly can.

264
00:16:34,249 --> 00:16:35,730
[SPEAKER_06]: I have all the shops.

265
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:41,072
[SPEAKER_06]: All of the different everything, all maxed out, all the achievements.

266
00:16:41,412 --> 00:16:44,873
[SPEAKER_06]: I have as many citizens as you can possibly fit in the building.

267
00:16:45,193 --> 00:16:47,154
[SPEAKER_06]: All I can do now is build a bunch of empty floors.

268
00:16:47,174 --> 00:16:48,134
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you're a cheater.

269
00:16:48,815 --> 00:16:50,015
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't care because you know what?

270
00:16:50,035 --> 00:16:50,815
[SPEAKER_06]: That game is annoying.

271
00:16:50,975 --> 00:16:52,416
[SPEAKER_06]: That game made my brain melt.

272
00:16:52,756 --> 00:16:54,957
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously, that's the feeling I got from playing it.

273
00:16:54,977 --> 00:16:57,578
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, oh, I'm so glad to be done with this game.

274
00:16:57,978 --> 00:16:58,699
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

275
00:17:21,461 --> 00:17:24,886
[SPEAKER_06]: I would think that they should be smart enough to know, hey, we're out of stuff.

276
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:27,369
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe we should, I don't know, restock it.

277
00:17:27,509 --> 00:17:29,651
[SPEAKER_05]: But then where's the game, Loki?

278
00:17:30,653 --> 00:17:31,594
[SPEAKER_04]: What would the game be?

279
00:17:31,974 --> 00:17:35,458
[SPEAKER_04]: You see, your problem with Tiny Tower is that it's not Tiny Tower Sniper.

280
00:17:35,538 --> 00:17:36,560
[SPEAKER_04]: That's your problem with it.

281
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,260
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

282
00:17:53,325 --> 00:17:54,406
[SPEAKER_06]: was a game dev story.

283
00:17:54,486 --> 00:17:55,326
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty fun.

284
00:17:55,546 --> 00:17:57,487
[SPEAKER_02]: Bobby says that Tiny Tower has a bug right now.

285
00:17:57,687 --> 00:18:01,108
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, if you have it open, you're only earning half the cash.

286
00:18:01,128 --> 00:18:03,049
[SPEAKER_04]: The newest version botched something.

287
00:18:03,329 --> 00:18:04,149
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

288
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:06,190
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm earning a lot of cash.

289
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:09,051
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, actually, I can't get any cash.

290
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:12,612
[SPEAKER_04]: You robbed the tiny bank and you took all their money.

291
00:18:14,933 --> 00:18:20,675
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more like he printed his own money with his tiny printing press.

292
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:30,798
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, I've gotten some FUs on Google and Twitter for mentioning Tiny Tower on this program.

293
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:32,841
[SPEAKER_04]: FU for getting me into Tiny Tower.

294
00:18:33,923 --> 00:18:36,066
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen that multiple times this week.

295
00:18:38,602 --> 00:18:47,228
[SPEAKER_06]: I tried playing Jukebeat on my iPod and it seems like a simple idea.

296
00:18:47,268 --> 00:18:51,331
[SPEAKER_06]: You just tap the squares as they light up.

297
00:18:51,771 --> 00:18:54,353
[SPEAKER_06]: For some reason, the difficulty is way too high.

298
00:18:55,073 --> 00:18:57,555
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm assuming it's because I have an iPod and it's really small.

299
00:18:58,335 --> 00:19:06,440
[SPEAKER_06]: You can tweak it so that the touch area is really big, so you can actually touch in the middle between two squares and it'll tap both of them.

300
00:19:06,861 --> 00:19:12,404
[SPEAKER_06]: But even still, after doing that, I still keep failing a level 2 song.

301
00:19:12,804 --> 00:19:16,707
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm sorry, if it's that hard, then it's a little ridiculous.

302
00:19:17,187 --> 00:19:19,789
[SPEAKER_06]: Why would I want to buy more songs for it?

303
00:19:20,589 --> 00:19:22,050
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

304
00:19:48,988 --> 00:19:53,409
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I'm saying the game that the In The Groove people made is better than the game that Konami made.

305
00:19:53,509 --> 00:19:54,629
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't believe I'm saying that.

306
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:55,050
[SPEAKER_04]: It's true.

307
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:55,650
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree.

308
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:57,050
[SPEAKER_06]: It is true.

309
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:02,872
[SPEAKER_06]: And the reason why it's true is because I shouldn't be failing a level 2 song.

310
00:20:02,932 --> 00:20:05,752
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, this is like if you're going to DDR, okay?

311
00:20:05,792 --> 00:20:07,193
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Loki, you just suck at jukebeat.

312
00:20:07,313 --> 00:20:07,593
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no.

313
00:20:08,093 --> 00:20:08,853
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I must.

314
00:20:08,933 --> 00:20:10,774
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm reading the comments from the internet right now.

315
00:20:11,034 --> 00:20:13,014
[SPEAKER_04]: You just... I'm imagining these guys.

316
00:20:13,334 --> 00:20:14,415
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, you just suck at jukebeat.

317
00:20:14,815 --> 00:20:15,075
[SPEAKER_04]: You just...

318
00:20:16,135 --> 00:20:16,976
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to try more.

319
00:20:47,616 --> 00:20:54,658
[SPEAKER_04]: The only thing about Jukebeat that's irritating is that when that little thing comes up, you have less than a second to hit it.

320
00:20:55,098 --> 00:20:56,499
[SPEAKER_04]: You have no time to react.

321
00:20:57,099 --> 00:20:58,420
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're playing that first song.

322
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,821
[SPEAKER_04]: Literally, it's lighting up.

323
00:21:00,841 --> 00:21:08,644
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a little passage in the Frogger song that goes... So you have to be able to hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it.

324
00:21:08,664 --> 00:21:09,004
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got to...

325
00:21:09,744 --> 00:21:11,626
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like playing whack-a-mole at hyperspeed.

326
00:21:11,886 --> 00:21:16,572
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's no real indication of what's going to be next other than it just moving really fast.

327
00:21:17,252 --> 00:21:17,813
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know.

328
00:21:17,973 --> 00:21:22,658
[SPEAKER_06]: If maybe U-Beat is a little bit better in the arcades, I'm not really sure.

329
00:21:22,738 --> 00:21:26,943
[SPEAKER_06]: But if this is exactly what it is in the arcades, I'm not too excited about it.

330
00:21:27,484 --> 00:21:28,405
[SPEAKER_06]: But hey, you know what?

331
00:21:28,425 --> 00:21:30,127
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of cool that they put something else out.

332
00:21:32,938 --> 00:21:34,359
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's just kind of eh.

333
00:21:34,759 --> 00:21:41,162
[SPEAKER_04]: SSJ100Mac confirms in chat, Juby, which is its name over in Japan, on the iPad is a lot better.

334
00:21:41,563 --> 00:21:46,645
[SPEAKER_04]: And I could see where on the iPad my fat finger isn't getting in the way so I can actually see all the things.

335
00:21:46,685 --> 00:21:49,347
[SPEAKER_04]: I can lay it on a table and probably play it easier.

336
00:21:49,967 --> 00:21:50,768
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

337
00:22:07,998 --> 00:22:10,520
[SPEAKER_04]: All Universal is means it has both versions in one.

338
00:22:10,761 --> 00:22:12,562
[SPEAKER_04]: You can still have different versions of the game.

339
00:22:12,782 --> 00:22:14,284
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Tiny Tower is Universal too.

340
00:22:15,004 --> 00:22:17,927
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, but still, then why is it played so terrible?

341
00:22:18,488 --> 00:22:21,290
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I didn't have this problem with ReRave.

342
00:22:22,191 --> 00:22:24,473
[SPEAKER_04]: ReRave, it was easy enough for me to hit everything.

343
00:22:24,773 --> 00:22:28,375
[SPEAKER_04]: I think re-rave just makes sense, and this game doesn't.

344
00:22:28,496 --> 00:22:29,076
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

345
00:22:29,196 --> 00:22:32,478
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just kind of where I'm at with it.

346
00:22:32,558 --> 00:22:34,700
[SPEAKER_04]: I think re-rave was just more interesting.

347
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:36,501
[SPEAKER_04]: The targets are a lot bigger.

348
00:22:36,801 --> 00:22:38,502
[SPEAKER_04]: They come up with more advanced notice.

349
00:22:38,882 --> 00:22:43,746
[SPEAKER_04]: They're actually on the beat, and you can tell, like, oh, a red one means it's on the downbeat.

350
00:22:44,126 --> 00:22:46,127
[SPEAKER_04]: A blue one means it's on the upbeat.

351
00:22:46,187 --> 00:22:47,748
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, it just makes more sense.

352
00:22:47,788 --> 00:22:49,209
[SPEAKER_04]: Like stuff that they used to do.

353
00:22:49,269 --> 00:22:50,590
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, fuck, there's notes everywhere.

354
00:22:51,571 --> 00:22:53,212
[SPEAKER_06]: Like stuff that they used to do in DDR.

355
00:22:55,453 --> 00:23:23,864
[SPEAKER_06]: it's like Konami you forget that you released music games in the past and what you did to make you know make those see that's what I don't understand this is a company that understands accessibility with their DDR games a little too much accessibility if you ask me but yet for some reason a casual gaming platform as you would normally view it they made this game so fucking difficult that most people would be just like whatever and they're just gonna get they'll delete it because it's free

356
00:23:25,345 --> 00:23:26,246
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that Contra song.

357
00:23:26,266 --> 00:23:27,488
[SPEAKER_04]: That Contra song is awesome.

358
00:23:27,568 --> 00:23:28,850
[SPEAKER_04]: But the rest of the songs are terrible.

359
00:23:43,126 --> 00:23:44,027
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't like Frogger.

360
00:23:44,067 --> 00:23:45,047
[SPEAKER_06]: Frogger needs to die.

361
00:23:45,367 --> 00:23:47,308
[SPEAKER_06]: They need to stop putting out new Frogger games.

362
00:23:47,448 --> 00:23:49,269
[SPEAKER_06]: The 3DS Frogger, eh.

363
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:54,151
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't understand the point for the 3DS Frogger, but whatever.

364
00:23:54,271 --> 00:23:57,153
[SPEAKER_06]: At least they're doing something slightly different with it.

365
00:23:59,414 --> 00:24:01,975
[SPEAKER_06]: Frogger, not really a game I know for its music.

366
00:24:02,395 --> 00:24:04,516
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, I don't believe there was any music in Frogger.

367
00:24:05,609 --> 00:24:07,491
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, I got to read some comments from chat here.

368
00:24:07,511 --> 00:24:09,132
[SPEAKER_04]: We're backing up on comments here.

369
00:24:09,673 --> 00:24:16,139
[SPEAKER_04]: Going back to the hacking stuff, Sickman wanted to clarify an earlier comment and says, Sky, you completely misunderstood me.

370
00:24:16,259 --> 00:24:17,821
[SPEAKER_04]: I meant they make shitty hardware.

371
00:24:18,441 --> 00:24:19,782
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to disagree with you there.

372
00:24:20,183 --> 00:24:25,708
[SPEAKER_04]: The hardware Xbox makes, I mean, considering the whole Red Rings of Death and all the other crap they've had to deal with.

373
00:24:26,008 --> 00:24:29,892
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Microsoft does kind of make shitty hardware, but my problem wasn't a hardware issue.

374
00:24:31,173 --> 00:24:31,433
[SPEAKER_06]: at all.

375
00:24:33,315 --> 00:24:34,675
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

376
00:24:34,755 --> 00:24:37,077
[SPEAKER_06]: Other things I played this week.

377
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:51,246
[SPEAKER_06]: VVVVVV because I got the Humble Indie Bundle and yeah, it's very difficult and I'm kind of frustrated I'm at this one level in the game where you have to escort this guy across the screen and it's annoying.

378
00:24:51,686 --> 00:24:56,269
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just annoying the controls because it's very floaty, I guess.

379
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:57,090
[SPEAKER_06]: Um.

380
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:06,899
[SPEAKER_06]: so but hey you get unlimited lives it's just sometimes it's annoying but I think I'm almost finished with the game I have like I think two more people to rescue and that's it

381
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:10,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but there might be a whole little twist coming up or something.

382
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:10,680
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I don't care.

383
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,640
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember how Castlevania had the upside-down castle?

384
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

385
00:25:13,621 --> 00:25:14,021
[SPEAKER_04]: Be ready.

386
00:25:15,141 --> 00:25:18,862
[SPEAKER_06]: And then other than that, let's see.

387
00:25:19,502 --> 00:25:21,503
[SPEAKER_06]: I played more Earth Defense Force.

388
00:25:21,583 --> 00:25:23,523
[SPEAKER_06]: I downloaded the two weapons packs for that.

389
00:25:23,543 --> 00:25:27,645
[SPEAKER_06]: I still haven't gotten a chance to actually try the weapons, but I've downloaded them.

390
00:25:28,185 --> 00:25:32,206
[SPEAKER_06]: And then also more Grand Theft Auto, of course.

391
00:25:33,066 --> 00:25:37,309
[SPEAKER_06]: and I do have in Singingly Twisted Child Planet but still haven't played it yet.

392
00:25:39,851 --> 00:25:43,533
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm really wanting to play it because the reviews have been great.

393
00:25:45,114 --> 00:25:45,755
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully soon.

394
00:25:48,430 --> 00:26:17,300
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's all I've played alright I'll talk about my gaming week besides what I mentioned at the top of the show well I have mentioned I played insanely twisted Shadow Planet which I was enjoying it's basically Metroid with kind of like Limbo's graphics in a way I don't know how else to explain it I really like it I downloaded the demo and the minute I realized I'm like oh this is like fucking Metroid except it's a spaceship that you control so it's more of a you don't just move left and right and jump you fly anywhere you want

395
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,421
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

396
00:26:34,597 --> 00:26:39,079
[SPEAKER_04]: But it doesn't exactly hand you the what to do on a silver platter.

397
00:26:39,459 --> 00:26:41,940
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very abstract in some ways.

398
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:44,041
[SPEAKER_04]: But it doesn't really take away from the experience.

399
00:26:44,481 --> 00:26:45,442
[SPEAKER_04]: I was really enjoying the game.

400
00:26:45,462 --> 00:26:47,663
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm kind of pissed I'm not going to be able to play it for three more weeks.

401
00:26:48,003 --> 00:26:50,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I was on a roll and I kind of wanted to beat it.

402
00:26:50,844 --> 00:26:52,345
[SPEAKER_04]: But I only got about maybe a third of the way.

403
00:26:52,365 --> 00:26:54,646
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it said I was like 30% complete or 33% complete.

404
00:26:55,006 --> 00:26:56,667
[SPEAKER_04]: Eh, won't be able to do that now for three weeks.

405
00:26:56,987 --> 00:26:58,148
[SPEAKER_04]: So thanks, hackers.

406
00:26:58,508 --> 00:27:01,029
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you recover your profile to your system?

407
00:27:01,229 --> 00:27:01,429
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

408
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:03,230
[SPEAKER_06]: You were unable to do that.

409
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:10,638
[SPEAKER_04]: No, well, they said I could play offline, but I just, I don't know, I'm at a point where I just don't want to because I don't want my achievements to get screwed up and all that.

410
00:27:10,659 --> 00:27:11,580
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it will get screwed up.

411
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:17,086
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to say, if you recovered your profile to your system, you could play it and it wouldn't matter because it would sync back up when you're done.

412
00:27:17,447 --> 00:27:20,290
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you haven't, then yes, all those achievements would go bye-bye.

413
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:21,531
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, no, I didn't do that.

414
00:27:21,591 --> 00:27:23,193
[SPEAKER_04]: So now I'm kind of stuck.

415
00:27:23,633 --> 00:27:24,474
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's all right.

416
00:27:24,694 --> 00:27:29,038
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got some stuff on PlayStation 3 I want to play, but just irritating.

417
00:27:29,458 --> 00:27:31,140
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's always WoW, right, Jamie?

418
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,401
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got a lot of ratings to do.

419
00:27:32,461 --> 00:27:32,821
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, there is.

420
00:27:32,841 --> 00:27:33,522
[SPEAKER_04]: You can play some L.A.

421
00:27:33,562 --> 00:27:34,323
[SPEAKER_04]: Noire.

422
00:27:34,463 --> 00:27:34,903
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

423
00:27:34,923 --> 00:27:35,804
[SPEAKER_04]: I have not touched L.A.

424
00:27:35,844 --> 00:27:37,606
[SPEAKER_04]: Noire yet, and I have your copy on PS3, so...

425
00:27:38,486 --> 00:27:40,328
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm totally missing it right now.

426
00:27:40,629 --> 00:27:41,410
[SPEAKER_04]: I do need to play it.

427
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:45,835
[SPEAKER_04]: The silver lining in my crap story is there are PS3 games I need to play.

428
00:27:45,855 --> 00:27:48,457
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually got back my games that I've been loaning out to people.

429
00:27:48,497 --> 00:27:50,339
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of them I completely forgot that I've been loaning out.

430
00:27:50,379 --> 00:27:53,463
[SPEAKER_06]: I got my 3D Dot Game Heroes back in Portal 2.

431
00:27:54,524 --> 00:27:57,027
[SPEAKER_06]: I like Portal 2 on every goddamn system now.

432
00:27:58,989 --> 00:28:00,630
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to go back and finish co-op in Portal 2.

433
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:01,731
[SPEAKER_04]: That's another thing I need to do.

434
00:28:01,791 --> 00:28:02,511
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've got plenty to do.

435
00:28:03,212 --> 00:28:05,814
[SPEAKER_04]: And randomly, okay, so insane Twisted Shadow Planet.

436
00:28:06,114 --> 00:28:10,918
[SPEAKER_04]: If you like Metroid, you need to be downloading the demo right now after you change your Xbox Live password.

437
00:28:10,958 --> 00:28:18,103
[SPEAKER_04]: Go check it out because, or the Castlevania, Metroidvania, any of those types of games, you will like this game.

438
00:28:18,624 --> 00:28:20,485
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got really pretty sharp graphics.

439
00:28:20,565 --> 00:28:21,926
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like playing a cartoon.

440
00:28:22,407 --> 00:28:23,007
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really cool.

441
00:28:23,487 --> 00:28:24,628
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got to check it out.

442
00:28:24,648 --> 00:28:25,969
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie, I think you would really like this.

443
00:28:26,009 --> 00:28:27,991
[SPEAKER_04]: You really need to make it a point to check it out this week.

444
00:28:28,994 --> 00:28:30,820
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan, change your password!

445
00:28:31,422 --> 00:28:32,184
[SPEAKER_04]: At least get the demo

446
00:28:34,721 --> 00:29:01,546
[SPEAKER_04]: by the way I forgot so go ahead I randomly had a I want to play Civilization 5 and when you want to play Civilization 5 that turns into a 5 minute thought that goes on for like 4 hours because you can't just like stop playing Civilization 5 so I played an entire campaign over the weekend you were still playing when I went to bed I was playing as the Spanish and I played from start to finish

447
00:29:01,886 --> 00:29:06,989
[SPEAKER_04]: Granted, I was playing on dopey easy level because I'm really not good at civilization, but I beat it.

448
00:29:07,389 --> 00:29:11,252
[SPEAKER_04]: I did a cultural victory and I got the no one expects the Spanish Inquisition achievement.

449
00:29:11,672 --> 00:29:13,413
[SPEAKER_04]: So now I'm playing another.

450
00:29:14,613 --> 00:29:15,274
[SPEAKER_04]: What better way?

451
00:29:15,294 --> 00:29:18,196
[SPEAKER_04]: I kicked it up a difficulty level and now I'm playing as...

452
00:29:18,996 --> 00:29:19,617
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

453
00:29:35,612 --> 00:29:36,573
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

454
00:29:51,809 --> 00:29:53,049
[SPEAKER_04]: It's my all-time favorite PC game.

455
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:56,290
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's no secret that I adore Civ 5.

456
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:57,691
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's one of the best in the series.

457
00:29:58,191 --> 00:29:59,391
[SPEAKER_04]: It's certainly better than 2 or 3.

458
00:30:00,031 --> 00:30:00,932
[SPEAKER_04]: 4 was pretty good too, though.

459
00:30:01,652 --> 00:30:02,292
[SPEAKER_04]: But I love 5.

460
00:30:03,452 --> 00:30:04,393
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was playing that.

461
00:30:04,953 --> 00:30:10,094
[SPEAKER_04]: And on the PlayStation 3, Extover had a random gaming night last night.

462
00:30:10,234 --> 00:30:12,655
[SPEAKER_04]: So a couple of us went over there and played...

463
00:30:13,135 --> 00:30:15,196
[SPEAKER_04]: Hardcore Uprising Super Smash Bros.

464
00:30:15,216 --> 00:30:15,316
[SPEAKER_04]: Melee

465
00:30:33,746 --> 00:30:34,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Brawls on the Wii?

466
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:36,467
[SPEAKER_04]: I can never remember which one's which.

467
00:30:37,267 --> 00:30:43,490
[SPEAKER_04]: We played the Wii one for a little while, and then we played one other game that I'm totally forgetting right now.

468
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:45,671
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we played Katamari Forever on the PlayStation 3.

469
00:30:45,931 --> 00:30:46,671
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, random, right?

470
00:30:46,751 --> 00:30:50,553
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, I brought a stack of games over, and that's what we chose to play, so...

471
00:30:51,353 --> 00:31:04,322
[SPEAKER_04]: that was my game night that's pretty much my gaming week lots I've been pretty busy and then of course wow wow wow lots of wow stuff but oh yeah I have the other show for that someone's gonna teach me how to tank for a fee I'm just kidding

472
00:31:05,058 --> 00:31:06,039
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll pay you in Pinkberry.

473
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:08,480
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

474
00:31:09,301 --> 00:31:13,324
[SPEAKER_04]: Blackwolf in our chatroom says, I love playing Dopey on Dopey Easy level in Civ 5.

475
00:31:13,384 --> 00:31:14,024
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so much fun.

476
00:31:14,044 --> 00:31:14,885
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the way to play.

477
00:31:15,865 --> 00:31:21,029
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the best way to play Civ 5, especially if you're not very good at the strategical types of games.

478
00:31:21,929 --> 00:31:22,229
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

479
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:25,252
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to do it for how was our gaming week.

480
00:31:25,332 --> 00:31:26,733
[SPEAKER_04]: Hope you guys had a good gaming week too.

481
00:31:27,374 --> 00:31:28,495
[SPEAKER_04]: Quickly, some housekeeping.

482
00:31:30,136 --> 00:31:32,058
[SPEAKER_04]: We're still having shows over the next few weeks.

483
00:31:32,078 --> 00:31:34,139
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys are going to do a show when I'm not here, right?

484
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,521
[SPEAKER_04]: You said you're going to do it anyway?

485
00:31:35,701 --> 00:31:36,061
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

486
00:31:36,441 --> 00:31:36,622
[SPEAKER_04]: No?

487
00:31:37,142 --> 00:31:37,562
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not doing it?

488
00:31:37,582 --> 00:31:38,023
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought you were.

489
00:31:38,303 --> 00:31:39,284
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm babysitting.

490
00:31:39,304 --> 00:31:40,285
[SPEAKER_04]: On a Sunday?

491
00:31:40,345 --> 00:31:40,625
[SPEAKER_04]: Sunday?

492
00:31:43,157 --> 00:31:43,437
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

493
00:31:43,797 --> 00:31:44,057
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

494
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:47,839
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not a human baby.

495
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:49,219
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, the kitty babies.

496
00:31:49,379 --> 00:31:50,060
[SPEAKER_04]: The kitty babies.

497
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,720
[SPEAKER_04]: That's on the 29th and 31st, I think.

498
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,121
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still watching the kitty babies.

499
00:31:53,241 --> 00:31:54,601
[SPEAKER_04]: So no show the 28th then?

500
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:55,422
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

501
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:55,902
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

502
00:31:56,302 --> 00:31:57,622
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, a show or yes, no show?

503
00:31:57,642 --> 00:31:57,822
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

504
00:31:57,863 --> 00:31:58,103
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

505
00:31:58,303 --> 00:31:58,983
[SPEAKER_04]: No show.

506
00:31:59,443 --> 00:32:00,804
[SPEAKER_04]: No show on the 28th.

507
00:32:01,584 --> 00:32:02,944
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can plan accordingly.

508
00:32:04,365 --> 00:32:04,645
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

509
00:32:05,165 --> 00:32:07,926
[SPEAKER_04]: Visit us on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

510
00:32:08,186 --> 00:32:10,087
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.

511
00:32:10,107 --> 00:32:11,528
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be taking some of your tweets at the end of the show.

512
00:32:11,548 --> 00:32:11,788
[SPEAKER_04]: And a Tumblr.

513
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:14,612
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, and our Tumblr now, too.

514
00:32:14,772 --> 00:32:17,476
[SPEAKER_04]: Orangelaunchradio.tumblr.com All right.

515
00:32:17,796 --> 00:32:19,819
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki just beat one of the hard parts of BBB.

516
00:32:19,939 --> 00:32:20,761
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

517
00:32:20,841 --> 00:32:22,724
[SPEAKER_06]: I fucking hate that stupid mission.

518
00:32:22,944 --> 00:32:23,625
[SPEAKER_06]: I hated that, too.

519
00:32:23,645 --> 00:32:24,005
[SPEAKER_04]: It was terrible.

520
00:32:24,045 --> 00:32:24,907
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's put this on pause for now.

521
00:32:25,107 --> 00:32:25,327
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

522
00:32:25,788 --> 00:32:28,592
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you got to put it on pause because you got to start us off with some news tonight.

523
00:32:28,632 --> 00:32:29,894
[SPEAKER_04]: What's going on in the gaming world tonight?

524
00:32:30,514 --> 00:32:30,995
[SPEAKER_06]: Lots of stuff.

525
00:32:31,315 --> 00:32:43,426
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's start talking about the Steam trading beta that they're going to have, which is kind of cool in case if you're buying some packs and you get a bunch of extra games or stuff gifted to you that you may already have and whatnot.

526
00:32:45,007 --> 00:32:51,853
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, what this is going to allow you to do is trade different items for, I guess...

527
00:32:52,834 --> 00:33:01,256
[SPEAKER_06]: Didn't really say yet, but like, for example, you can trade, I don't know why you would do this, trade like games for hacks in Team Fortress 2.

528
00:33:03,137 --> 00:33:04,437
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I don't know about that.

529
00:33:06,078 --> 00:33:11,339
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, right now the service only supports trading of items, I guess, in Team Fortress 2.

530
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:16,161
[SPEAKER_06]: But they're going to be supporting other things soon, I guess, Portal 2.

531
00:33:16,761 --> 00:33:20,262
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think maybe they're talking a little bit more of just actually like in-game items right now.

532
00:33:21,402 --> 00:33:24,865
[SPEAKER_06]: But eventually you'll be able to trade for games and whatnot.

533
00:33:26,226 --> 00:33:28,627
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess they're going to be allowing you to trade for games.

534
00:33:31,129 --> 00:33:32,550
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's kind of cool.

535
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:40,515
[SPEAKER_06]: And actually, if you think about it, I mean, that's pretty cool that they're heading in that direction anyways.

536
00:33:40,535 --> 00:33:44,398
[SPEAKER_06]: Because if you think about it, you can swap games with people.

537
00:33:45,078 --> 00:33:45,959
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, essentially.

538
00:33:45,979 --> 00:33:46,059
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

539
00:33:46,579 --> 00:33:47,720
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's a neat idea.

540
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:53,824
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's still in its early, early stages, obviously, so of course it's kind of restricted to Valve products.

541
00:33:53,864 --> 00:34:04,071
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I guess it's not just Valve products you can trade, but I guess the stuff that you can trade for right now is really only Valve, at least with the microtransaction type of stuff.

542
00:34:04,412 --> 00:34:10,516
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's still very vague to me, like how this all works, because I don't really have any extra copies of games to trade right now.

543
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:12,938
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish I'd known this when I bought Terraria.

544
00:34:13,438 --> 00:34:14,739
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't have given a copy to Jamie.

545
00:34:14,759 --> 00:34:15,660
[SPEAKER_04]: I would have traded it away.

546
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:15,960
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey!

547
00:34:17,666 --> 00:34:19,949
[SPEAKER_02]: I like Minecraft Aria.

548
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:21,170
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of.

549
00:34:22,812 --> 00:34:26,177
[SPEAKER_04]: I had four copies of that game and I literally gave a copy to somebody.

550
00:34:26,237 --> 00:34:28,019
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, I think he'll like it.

551
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:28,600
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

552
00:34:30,002 --> 00:34:31,223
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't even know if he's played it.

553
00:34:31,484 --> 00:34:32,986
[SPEAKER_04]: So I could have traded that for a hat.

554
00:34:34,430 --> 00:34:34,911
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

555
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:58,331
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of go, eh, I don't really need a hat in Team Fortress 2 because I don't really play that game.

556
00:34:58,351 --> 00:35:05,435
[SPEAKER_04]: But then I go, huh, if 2K bought into this, I could buy the Korean Civilization expansion for Civ 5 and that I would enjoy.

557
00:35:05,455 --> 00:35:13,040
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's amazing how this buy-sell-trade stuff works and how people like it and how it promotes the sales of new items.

558
00:35:13,561 --> 00:35:14,461
[SPEAKER_06]: That's amazing.

559
00:35:15,082 --> 00:35:17,103
[SPEAKER_06]: Gee, I wish publishers would have thought of that.

560
00:35:21,489 --> 00:35:31,773
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think we're going to get into the topic again, of course, of how they're trying to discourage buy-sell trade stuff with more of the online codes and whatnot.

561
00:35:32,233 --> 00:35:36,294
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't understand that they're just... I think we have a game that's doing something.

562
00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:38,475
[SPEAKER_04]: It's something different than an online pass.

563
00:35:38,495 --> 00:35:39,856
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll get to that.

564
00:35:41,076 --> 00:35:44,157
[SPEAKER_06]: But they don't understand that they're only hurting themselves.

565
00:35:44,277 --> 00:35:47,399
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, by discouraging buy-sell... First off...

566
00:35:50,841 --> 00:35:59,509
[SPEAKER_06]: The argument that the developers don't get money for these games if people are buying used copies is a bunch of bullshit.

567
00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:08,198
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, for one, the developers get money when the game is sold from the publisher, not bought in the store.

568
00:36:08,558 --> 00:36:10,039
[SPEAKER_06]: Perfect example, Catherine.

569
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:11,882
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching!

570
00:36:26,804 --> 00:36:32,630
[SPEAKER_06]: So, say for example, your average gamer, they can't afford new games.

571
00:36:33,791 --> 00:36:42,320
[SPEAKER_06]: And so they're buying used games, they're selling their used games, trading them into a GameStop or wherever to get credit towards a new game.

572
00:36:43,101 --> 00:36:43,621
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

573
00:37:09,019 --> 00:37:09,600
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

574
00:37:26,034 --> 00:37:26,594
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

575
00:37:44,039 --> 00:37:54,667
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think, not everybody but I think there's going to be some people that are like oh I could buy the multi-pack for just a few dollars more and I guess I could maybe trade somebody that for a DLC and get like a deal there.

576
00:37:55,047 --> 00:38:01,212
[SPEAKER_04]: It's opening up this whole new flea market style thing for games it's really interesting to me.

577
00:38:02,152 --> 00:38:02,393
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

578
00:38:02,633 --> 00:38:03,214
[SPEAKER_04]: Looking forward to that.

579
00:38:04,175 --> 00:38:05,918
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you purchasing something on Steam right now?

580
00:38:06,118 --> 00:38:06,378
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

581
00:38:06,999 --> 00:38:07,780
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm being nosy.

582
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:08,201
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you buying?

583
00:38:08,221 --> 00:38:09,743
[SPEAKER_02]: Oddworld Abe's Odyssey is $1.24.

584
00:38:10,885 --> 00:38:11,986
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh.

585
00:38:12,006 --> 00:38:12,607
[SPEAKER_04]: A whole dollar?

586
00:38:13,288 --> 00:38:13,568
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

587
00:38:14,149 --> 00:38:14,870
[SPEAKER_02]: I like Oddworld.

588
00:38:15,051 --> 00:38:15,772
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Oddworld's cool.

589
00:38:19,269 --> 00:38:19,609
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

590
00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:23,950
[SPEAKER_04]: So looking at our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

591
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:29,511
[SPEAKER_04]: Infanel in our chat room says, buy games during the special deals at 75% off.

592
00:38:29,551 --> 00:38:31,352
[SPEAKER_04]: Trade later when the price goes back to normal.

593
00:38:31,512 --> 00:38:31,992
[SPEAKER_04]: Possibly.

594
00:38:33,012 --> 00:38:33,432
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

595
00:38:35,533 --> 00:38:38,713
[SPEAKER_04]: Breakman in chat says, what kind of in-game items does Portal 2 have?

596
00:38:38,793 --> 00:38:44,595
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing yet, but that's... Well, yeah, there are hats, but aren't they supposed to be getting some other stuff soon?

597
00:38:44,995 --> 00:38:45,175
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

598
00:38:45,835 --> 00:38:49,098
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, where the hell is that download content that we were promised back in June?

599
00:38:49,859 --> 00:38:50,320
[SPEAKER_06]: IDK.

600
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:56,586
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that going to come out before or after Half-Life 2 Episode 3?

601
00:38:58,287 --> 00:38:58,607
[SPEAKER_06]: After?

602
00:38:58,908 --> 00:38:59,308
[SPEAKER_06]: Damn.

603
00:38:59,688 --> 00:39:00,709
[SPEAKER_04]: That's assuming it's coming out.

604
00:39:00,729 --> 00:39:03,172
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you see people protesting outside of Valve for Half-Life 3?

605
00:39:04,993 --> 00:39:06,275
[SPEAKER_04]: I know one of the guys that was doing it.

606
00:39:06,335 --> 00:39:08,437
[SPEAKER_04]: It was apparently an old guildie of mine from Valve.

607
00:39:08,457 --> 00:39:09,017
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I'm sorry.

608
00:39:10,018 --> 00:39:10,639
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me put it this way.

609
00:39:10,919 --> 00:39:12,160
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they were just having fun.

610
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,101
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, well, good.

611
00:39:13,141 --> 00:39:14,963
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad they're having fun because you know what?

612
00:39:15,063 --> 00:39:17,705
[SPEAKER_06]: Gabe isn't starving for sales.

613
00:39:18,045 --> 00:39:20,127
[SPEAKER_06]: He's definitely not starving at all.

614
00:39:20,307 --> 00:39:27,834
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, so there's no reason to think that they're in a hurry to make Half-Life 2 Episode 3.

615
00:39:29,996 --> 00:39:34,820
[SPEAKER_04]: I got the sense that it was just something fun to do.

616
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:35,921
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll do whatever.

617
00:39:35,961 --> 00:39:37,803
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they'll work on it.

618
00:39:39,574 --> 00:39:40,095
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

619
00:39:55,896 --> 00:40:01,561
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, moving on, talking about other games and so forth, PC games specifically, Battlefield 3.

620
00:40:02,822 --> 00:40:11,170
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know what's interesting is one of the ways a lot of people got hooked on Steam was that if you wanted to play certain Valve games, you kind of had to install Steam, and then everybody saw the deals that came with that.

621
00:40:11,691 --> 00:40:18,857
[SPEAKER_04]: And then of course a bunch of other publishers got on board, and we just talked earlier, there was a chatroom comment about some games that require game for Windows to power them.

622
00:40:19,237 --> 00:40:19,478
[SPEAKER_04]: Well...

623
00:40:19,998 --> 00:40:24,120
[SPEAKER_04]: EA is soon going to be requiring Origin for Battlefield 3.

624
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:30,102
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right, if you want to play the PC version of Battlefield 3, you will have to register for EA's Origin service.

625
00:40:30,823 --> 00:40:34,904
[SPEAKER_04]: This came from the DICE community manager, Daniel Matros.

626
00:40:35,385 --> 00:40:36,705
[SPEAKER_04]: This was all confirmed via Twitter.

627
00:40:36,745 --> 00:40:40,667
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess somebody had put it out there if this was going to be a requirement, and it was confirmed.

628
00:40:41,227 --> 00:40:56,666
[SPEAKER_04]: So retail, digital, doesn't matter where you buy it, you will have to sign up for Origin, which if I'm not mistaken, EA's whole online thing kind of all shifted to Origin anyway, so it doesn't totally surprise me, but I don't know, it's just like, I really don't want...

629
00:40:57,347 --> 00:40:58,728
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

630
00:41:19,463 --> 00:41:22,084
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's because you want to try to sell exclusively on Origin.

631
00:41:22,104 --> 00:41:23,344
[SPEAKER_06]: That's really the deal.

632
00:41:23,364 --> 00:41:25,565
[SPEAKER_06]: But you want to make Valve out to be the bad guy.

633
00:41:25,785 --> 00:41:30,586
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on, because their complaint is that Valve wants to control the patching.

634
00:41:30,926 --> 00:41:32,067
[SPEAKER_04]: And EA doesn't want that.

635
00:41:32,207 --> 00:41:33,527
[SPEAKER_04]: EA wants to control the patching.

636
00:41:33,947 --> 00:41:37,188
[SPEAKER_04]: To really make a long story short is ultimately what it boils down to.

637
00:41:37,488 --> 00:41:41,149
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't want to have to push all their patches through Valve and get approval from Valve.

638
00:41:41,469 --> 00:41:42,650
[SPEAKER_04]: They want to be able to do it themselves.

639
00:41:43,570 --> 00:41:44,250
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what it blows down.

640
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:48,812
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but see, that doesn't make any sense until we know how hard the approval process is for patching.

641
00:41:49,093 --> 00:41:50,613
[SPEAKER_06]: If they're like, here's the patch, okay.

642
00:41:50,893 --> 00:41:54,055
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's just an excuse is what it is.

643
00:41:56,296 --> 00:42:00,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Going to our chatroom in the comments, Kaijudo says, I won't be playing Battlefield 3 on PC.

644
00:42:00,881 --> 00:42:04,024
[SPEAKER_04]: Zether says, fuck Battlefield 3, I'll play Battlefield 2 instead.

645
00:42:04,865 --> 00:42:12,593
[SPEAKER_04]: Going back a little bit further, talking about Half-Life and all that, Tigerclaw says, the Source engine throughout the years has been getting massive upgrades with every new game.

646
00:42:13,034 --> 00:42:17,058
[SPEAKER_04]: Take Portal 2 for example, it runs on the Source engine and the graphics are better than before.

647
00:42:17,678 --> 00:42:18,119
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.

648
00:42:19,179 --> 00:42:22,662
[SPEAKER_04]: Tigerclaw also points out to the folks saying, fuck Battlefield 3 on PC.

649
00:42:23,462 --> 00:42:27,546
[SPEAKER_04]: A game like that was strictly made for PC in mind, then portaled to the consoles.

650
00:42:28,887 --> 00:42:35,031
[SPEAKER_06]: But see, you know, this whole requirement for Origin and stuff, that's just right now.

651
00:42:35,071 --> 00:42:41,136
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, look at, like, Portal 2 and stuff, or even on the other, like, Valve products.

652
00:42:41,376 --> 00:42:44,598
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't have to be connected to Steam nor to play those on your PC.

653
00:42:45,319 --> 00:42:45,699
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you don't.

654
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:52,094
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I mean, hackers will fix the problem, okay?

655
00:42:52,334 --> 00:42:54,756
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll come and save the day and that'll be the end of that.

656
00:42:55,176 --> 00:42:56,817
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of like Steam.

657
00:42:56,917 --> 00:43:02,181
[SPEAKER_04]: Their actions have shown that they're really trying to be on the pulse of what gamers really want.

658
00:43:02,461 --> 00:43:05,623
[SPEAKER_04]: Not what executives want for gamers, but what gamers really want.

659
00:43:06,043 --> 00:43:08,145
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the sales have been really kick-ass.

660
00:43:08,845 --> 00:43:14,029
[SPEAKER_04]: This whole trading thing, although it's a little weird, I like that they're even fucking going there.

661
00:43:14,469 --> 00:43:20,031
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I do not expect Origin or Games for Windows to be following this, what Valve's trying to do here.

662
00:43:20,391 --> 00:43:23,192
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's kind of part of the reason I'm a little loyal to Steam.

663
00:43:23,693 --> 00:43:30,235
[SPEAKER_04]: They've shown, they've really tried to push what they're trying to do for privacy and security and to make sure all that stuff's locked down.

664
00:43:30,615 --> 00:43:34,597
[SPEAKER_04]: Their DRM is restrictive enough without being too restrictive.

665
00:43:34,617 --> 00:43:40,579
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I don't want to come off sounding like a fanboy, but I feel like Steam's proven themselves where others have not.

666
00:43:42,935 --> 00:43:44,436
[SPEAKER_04]: and that's basically what it boils down to, right?

667
00:43:44,516 --> 00:43:44,816
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

668
00:43:44,836 --> 00:43:45,496
[SPEAKER_04]: It's my money.

669
00:43:45,797 --> 00:43:46,257
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

670
00:43:46,357 --> 00:43:47,117
[SPEAKER_04]: Prove to me you want it.

671
00:43:47,217 --> 00:43:47,738
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

672
00:43:49,078 --> 00:43:53,101
[SPEAKER_04]: You're starting to sound like what's her name in Portal 2, the secretary.

673
00:43:53,121 --> 00:43:54,041
[SPEAKER_01]: Burn his house down.

674
00:43:56,663 --> 00:44:00,345
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, anyhow, let's move on, DarkSakura.

675
00:44:00,745 --> 00:44:02,286
[SPEAKER_04]: Away from the PCs for a little bit, right?

676
00:44:02,406 --> 00:44:04,407
[SPEAKER_02]: How about some Wii stuff?

677
00:44:05,456 --> 00:44:05,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Wee!

678
00:44:05,836 --> 00:44:06,017
[SPEAKER_02]: Wee!

679
00:44:24,794 --> 00:44:29,215
[SPEAKER_02]: and it has the microphone, speaker, and camera functions that are also included.

680
00:44:29,695 --> 00:44:37,518
[SPEAKER_02]: There's actually a neat little diagram of someone holding a Wiimote over it and using it as a, like playing golf with it.

681
00:44:37,638 --> 00:44:45,640
[SPEAKER_02]: So using it to sense where the Wiimote is in terms of the floor, I guess.

682
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:57,587
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're also saying that it does have different IR modules and likely it's going to also include connectivity with the 3DS.

683
00:44:58,527 --> 00:45:03,711
[SPEAKER_02]: And it also says it's going to be about as strong as the PS3 and the Xbox 360.

684
00:45:05,336 --> 00:45:05,757
[SPEAKER_04]: Magnetometer

685
00:45:23,647 --> 00:45:24,768
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

686
00:45:43,743 --> 00:45:44,164
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it does.

687
00:45:44,184 --> 00:45:45,485
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't want to do the Japanese releases.

688
00:45:45,525 --> 00:45:48,209
[SPEAKER_04]: There's usually some type of navigation software for the PSP.

689
00:45:48,369 --> 00:45:50,131
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they have an attachment for it.

690
00:45:50,331 --> 00:45:51,993
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an extra accessory.

691
00:45:52,194 --> 00:45:54,817
[SPEAKER_02]: I meant this is going to be for the Vita, but it's already in the move.

692
00:45:55,831 --> 00:46:03,774
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's all just going to be integrated into their whole immersive environment type of thing I really want to know what Nintendo's online thing is going to be I almost think it's going to be something like a handheld Kinect

693
00:46:25,083 --> 00:46:28,505
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll have this similar functionality, except it's going to use it in conjunction with the Wiimote.

694
00:46:29,846 --> 00:46:30,326
[SPEAKER_02]: Something like that.

695
00:46:30,346 --> 00:46:33,508
[SPEAKER_06]: I think their online's going to be tur-arable.

696
00:46:33,888 --> 00:46:35,689
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you say turd-arable?

697
00:46:35,729 --> 00:46:37,971
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought you were going to say terraria, and I was like, really?

698
00:46:37,991 --> 00:46:39,952
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to Minecraft your way on Nintendo Switch?

699
00:46:40,152 --> 00:46:42,534
[SPEAKER_06]: I was making it seem like I was going to say terrific.

700
00:46:42,854 --> 00:46:46,276
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, mid-word, I changed it to terrible.

701
00:46:46,296 --> 00:46:46,516
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.

702
00:46:46,656 --> 00:46:47,277
[SPEAKER_02]: Turdrific.

703
00:46:47,297 --> 00:46:50,419
[SPEAKER_06]: Therefore, being funny, adding humor to the word.

704
00:46:50,479 --> 00:46:51,400
[SPEAKER_02]: I like turdrific.

705
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:53,581
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to use turdrific from now on.

706
00:46:53,641 --> 00:46:56,623
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Loki, yet another failure of your humor on this program.

707
00:46:56,683 --> 00:47:02,127
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, I considered excess myself, so... Failure, I do not see that.

708
00:47:02,928 --> 00:47:06,411
[SPEAKER_06]: Just like the 3DS, it is a very successful product.

709
00:47:07,171 --> 00:47:08,532
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not failing at all.

710
00:47:08,752 --> 00:47:09,373
[SPEAKER_06]: Horse turds.

711
00:47:10,854 --> 00:47:11,634
[SPEAKER_04]: I like turdrific.

712
00:47:11,674 --> 00:47:13,376
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll use that in a sentence three times today.

713
00:47:14,497 --> 00:47:14,877
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

714
00:47:18,221 --> 00:47:18,801
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's move on.

715
00:47:18,821 --> 00:47:20,542
[SPEAKER_06]: More gaming news, Loki.

716
00:47:20,602 --> 00:47:21,162
[SPEAKER_06]: Guess what?

717
00:47:21,402 --> 00:47:23,282
[SPEAKER_06]: PS3's got another firmware.

718
00:47:23,563 --> 00:47:26,023
[SPEAKER_06]: Hurrah!

719
00:47:26,543 --> 00:47:26,023
3.7.

720
00:47:26,603 --> 00:47:31,744
[SPEAKER_06]: It brings fun stuff as auto cloud saves and trophy syncing as well.

721
00:47:32,705 --> 00:47:37,846
[SPEAKER_06]: However, in order to actually access any of these features, you have to be a PlayStation Plus member.

722
00:47:38,684 --> 00:47:39,285
[SPEAKER_06]: That's too bad.

723
00:47:41,487 --> 00:47:46,571
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, some of the stuff that they were hinting at before when they were talking a little bit about PlayStation Plus.

724
00:47:46,891 --> 00:47:50,395
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, they've done some rearranging of their TV and video services.

725
00:47:51,456 --> 00:47:53,838
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess I'll be added to the cross-media bar now.

726
00:47:54,598 --> 00:47:59,580
[SPEAKER_06]: and a new category will house online services like Hulu and Netflix.

727
00:48:00,241 --> 00:48:02,822
[SPEAKER_06]: So kind of tweaking some arrangement around.

728
00:48:02,862 --> 00:48:04,783
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving your stuff all around.

729
00:48:04,883 --> 00:48:09,305
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course the undocumented features are they're signing stuff with new codes now.

730
00:48:10,405 --> 00:48:11,566
[SPEAKER_06]: Or new keys, I guess.

731
00:48:12,116 --> 00:48:14,357
[SPEAKER_04]: Trying to prevent all the hacking and cracking behind the scenes.

732
00:48:14,697 --> 00:48:15,037
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course.

733
00:48:16,458 --> 00:48:17,158
[SPEAKER_04]: I said trying.

734
00:48:17,918 --> 00:48:20,439
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, that is the key word, of course.

735
00:48:21,079 --> 00:48:21,520
[SPEAKER_06]: Trying.

736
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:23,920
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure somebody found a way around it in 24 hours.

737
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:25,581
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they already have.

738
00:48:28,982 --> 00:48:29,282
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

739
00:48:29,803 --> 00:48:33,584
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I downloaded the firmware and I didn't really notice anything.

740
00:48:35,085 --> 00:48:35,725
[SPEAKER_04]: Hooray, I guess.

741
00:48:37,344 --> 00:48:40,327
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess I always expect maybe my games will suddenly be more fun.

742
00:48:41,308 --> 00:48:42,789
[SPEAKER_04]: Patches don't ever really seem to have that.

743
00:48:43,928 --> 00:48:45,989
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Gamefly, you've probably heard of them.

744
00:48:46,049 --> 00:48:51,151
[SPEAKER_04]: They're a pretty popular Netflix-y type of service for games.

745
00:48:51,251 --> 00:48:59,034
[SPEAKER_04]: But this time, they're kind of going further in that direction of Netflix, where soon you'll be able to play the games on demand.

746
00:48:59,494 --> 00:49:01,095
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a PC thing, though.

747
00:49:01,115 --> 00:49:03,236
[SPEAKER_04]: It's unlimited PC play service.

748
00:49:03,616 --> 00:49:08,258
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they took over direct-to-drive some time ago, and this seems to be the next step of that.

749
00:49:09,058 --> 00:49:26,623
[SPEAKER_04]: Gamefly says that they are talking to all publishers about participating several have been signed but we're not announcing at this time in the unlimited PC play portion for Gamefly subscribers we expect to have over 100 titles available for the beta launch but we'll be adding to the list constantly and should have hundreds at the time of our holiday launch so

750
00:49:27,823 --> 00:49:54,617
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess also some folks are asking well then if they're going to have the PC thing only will there be a plan for Gamefly that is only PC kind of like how there's a Netflix streaming only plan Sean Spector the co-founder of Gamefly said in response to that we currently have no plans to offer a digital only subscription as we believe the real value to gamers and our members is our unique combination of console and digital PC game offerings so in other words no the plans aren't going to be any cheaper so

751
00:49:55,237 --> 00:49:56,818
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that's kind of cool.

752
00:49:57,238 --> 00:49:58,179
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I don't know.

753
00:49:58,259 --> 00:50:01,120
[SPEAKER_04]: It kind of sounds like what GameTap used to be.

754
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:02,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember GameTap?

755
00:50:02,801 --> 00:50:04,542
[SPEAKER_04]: They're still around, but they suck now.

756
00:50:04,862 --> 00:50:06,863
[SPEAKER_04]: When they first came out, it was an interesting concept.

757
00:50:06,943 --> 00:50:11,205
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, then they got sold and not so great anymore.

758
00:50:11,525 --> 00:50:14,486
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess it's kind of neat that somebody's trying to pick that up.

759
00:50:15,367 --> 00:50:17,487
[SPEAKER_04]: I noticed this little demo screenshot.

760
00:50:17,507 --> 00:50:22,389
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if this was just mocked up by somebody, but it has games like DC Universe and so forth in there.

761
00:50:22,829 --> 00:50:25,410
[SPEAKER_06]: It's because they bought Direct Drive.

762
00:50:26,131 --> 00:50:27,811
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and that was some of the games that were on there?

763
00:50:27,931 --> 00:50:28,192
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

764
00:50:28,512 --> 00:50:28,952
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

765
00:50:29,552 --> 00:50:34,674
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it'd be kind of cool if some of the games are playable infinitely, but I don't know.

766
00:50:34,694 --> 00:50:41,177
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have my hopes up that it'll be much more than a lot of the Flash games or really old games.

767
00:50:41,217 --> 00:50:44,258
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of what GameTap had, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.

768
00:50:44,358 --> 00:50:46,158
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, just because a game is old doesn't mean it's bad.

769
00:50:47,059 --> 00:50:52,561
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing I really liked about GameTap was that it had all the old-ass King's Quest games and all the old Zort games and all of that.

770
00:50:52,981 --> 00:50:53,381
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura

771
00:51:04,830 --> 00:51:08,532
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, how about some news for the UK Nintendo 3DS price cut?

772
00:51:09,412 --> 00:51:26,199
[SPEAKER_02]: This is basically just the overall game revealed recently that they have a trade-in deal where if you trade in a DSi XL, you can get a 3DS for £49.99 or with Zelda Ocarina of Time for £59.99.

773
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:29,921
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's actually a pretty decent deal.

774
00:51:31,241 --> 00:51:37,609
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, the regular price of that is $159.99 bundled with a Zelda Ocarina of Time.

775
00:51:37,869 --> 00:51:39,772
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, this is in British pounds.

776
00:51:40,693 --> 00:51:43,737
[SPEAKER_02]: If you trade in a DSi, you will get it for $89.99.

777
00:51:46,178 --> 00:51:54,205
[SPEAKER_02]: So looking at the vendors overall, this is what you're looking for for the different prices.

778
00:51:54,305 --> 00:51:56,547
[SPEAKER_02]: Not all of them are going to price match, but here's what we have.

779
00:51:57,067 --> 00:51:59,249
[SPEAKER_02]: For Tesco, it's 115 pounds.

780
00:51:59,289 --> 00:51:59,990
[SPEAKER_02]: For Morrison's, 120.

781
00:52:00,030 --> 00:52:00,110
[SPEAKER_02]: Asda, 134.

782
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:01,791
[SPEAKER_02]: Sainsbury's, 140 pounds.

783
00:52:09,137 --> 00:52:12,140
[SPEAKER_02]: Online, for Amazon it's $115, Shop 2 is $135, GameStop $135, GamePlay $135, and Play $140.

784
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:17,965
[SPEAKER_02]: And then High Street and online it says Toys R Us is $135, Curry's is $140, Argos is $150, Game is $150, while online it's $140, and HMV is $150 and includes a free game.

785
00:52:17,985 --> 00:52:18,925
[SPEAKER_02]: It's $140 online.

786
00:52:34,057 --> 00:52:57,625
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to kind of piggyback on that a little bit, if you want to know what's going on here in the U.S., Target honestly started a system, which I thought was weird, because I didn't really think of Target as buying your old systems, but apparently Target, I guess it was just this past weekend, so you might have already missed it, so sorry about that, but I guess Target was accepting DS trade-ins as credit towards a 3DS, an XL was worth $100, a DSi was worth $75, so I guess...

787
00:53:02,566 --> 00:53:05,048
[SPEAKER_04]: My target doesn't sell used games or any that I've seen.

788
00:53:05,088 --> 00:53:07,250
[SPEAKER_04]: Are there other targets out there that are in the used game market now?

789
00:53:07,370 --> 00:53:09,933
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't seen it unless they have a deal with another used game vendor.

790
00:53:10,153 --> 00:53:10,673
[SPEAKER_04]: That could be.

791
00:53:10,934 --> 00:53:16,419
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe they sell them back to a vendor that sells those.

792
00:53:16,459 --> 00:53:16,819
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

793
00:53:16,999 --> 00:53:17,339
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

794
00:53:19,962 --> 00:53:22,904
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep your eye out on places like Target and so forth here in the U.S.

795
00:53:22,924 --> 00:53:25,346
[SPEAKER_04]: because there will probably be other details like that soon.

796
00:53:26,127 --> 00:53:34,857
[SPEAKER_04]: So, anyhow, speaking of things to do at the game store, there's some release dates we gotta go over around the world, and we'll start off with the US release dates, Loki.

797
00:53:36,122 --> 00:53:40,546
[SPEAKER_06]: Not a lot this week, of course, because this month's... That's been the theme of the past month.

798
00:53:40,566 --> 00:53:41,267
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, pretty much.

799
00:53:41,367 --> 00:53:42,187
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been slow.

800
00:53:42,508 --> 00:53:44,569
[SPEAKER_06]: But at least there are some actual things coming out.

801
00:53:45,070 --> 00:53:49,934
[SPEAKER_06]: Starting off with No More Heroes Heroes Paradise on the PlayStation 3.

802
00:53:49,994 --> 00:53:56,759
[SPEAKER_06]: That's actually getting a budget price to it, which is kind of cool, because it was full price at one point.

803
00:53:58,641 --> 00:54:00,282
[SPEAKER_06]: With move support as well, so you...

804
00:54:01,423 --> 00:54:02,003
[SPEAKER_06]: Age of Empires Online on PC

805
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:38,565
[SPEAKER_06]: Puzzler World 2 for Nintendo DS Emily the Strange Strangerous on the Nintendo DS and yeah maybe this is the problem with the Wii right here

806
00:54:39,713 --> 00:54:43,376
[SPEAKER_06]: Jerry Rice and Nidus, Dog Football for the Nintendo Wii.

807
00:54:43,657 --> 00:54:44,958
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck, that sounds awesome.

808
00:54:45,058 --> 00:54:46,059
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the Puppy Bowl.

809
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:48,040
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like the best part of the Super Bowl.

810
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:48,941
[SPEAKER_06]: Dog Football.

811
00:54:48,961 --> 00:54:50,142
[SPEAKER_02]: The only good part of the Super Bowl.

812
00:54:50,162 --> 00:54:52,124
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the only thing worth watching is the Puppy Bowl.

813
00:54:52,224 --> 00:54:54,706
[SPEAKER_04]: I could give two shits about the regular football game.

814
00:54:54,726 --> 00:54:55,587
[SPEAKER_02]: The Kitty Cat Halftime?

815
00:54:55,647 --> 00:54:57,869
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Kitty Cat Halftime is what it's all about.

816
00:54:58,530 --> 00:54:59,731
[SPEAKER_06]: Dog Football on the Wii.

817
00:55:00,591 --> 00:55:02,913
[SPEAKER_04]: That's an amazing release on the Wii.

818
00:55:02,973 --> 00:55:05,676
[SPEAKER_04]: Why you gotta be rough on the releases?

819
00:55:09,451 --> 00:55:10,752
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't forget to tip your waitress, everybody.

820
00:55:34,009 --> 00:55:35,390
[SPEAKER_04]: No, wait, I did see one.

821
00:55:36,030 --> 00:55:38,191
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw one, so I guess it is slowly coming out.

822
00:55:38,791 --> 00:55:39,711
[SPEAKER_04]: So, there you go.

823
00:55:40,312 --> 00:55:43,733
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, anyhow, moving on to the Japanese releases and what's coming out over there.

824
00:55:44,513 --> 00:55:53,177
[SPEAKER_04]: On the Xbox 360, Dirt 3 comes out on the 25th on the Xbox 360, and that's pretty much the only release you have to look forward to over there.

825
00:55:53,857 --> 00:56:00,940
[SPEAKER_04]: On the PlayStation 3, on the 18th, there is Chojigan Game Neptune.

826
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:01,900
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even know.

827
00:56:01,940 --> 00:56:02,661
[SPEAKER_04]: What the heck is this?

828
00:56:02,681 --> 00:56:03,962
[SPEAKER_04]: It's from Idea Factory.

829
00:56:05,202 --> 00:56:11,526
[SPEAKER_04]: And it is the evil witch Magikon is back and GameGalio World falls into chaos.

830
00:56:12,206 --> 00:56:17,169
[SPEAKER_04]: The shops ran out of business, the creators are starving, and most of the children are worshipping Magikon as a goddess.

831
00:56:17,910 --> 00:56:18,510
[SPEAKER_04]: So what is this?

832
00:56:18,530 --> 00:56:25,634
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a collaboration between Gust, Nippon Ichi, 5BP, KI Concept, Idea Factory, and Compile Heart.

833
00:56:25,654 --> 00:56:26,235
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a lot of...

834
00:56:26,835 --> 00:56:27,415
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

835
00:56:47,091 --> 00:56:55,477
[SPEAKER_04]: on the Wii, but on the PSP, Amnesia, I do not believe that is the same Amnesia that scares the shit out of people on the PC here.

836
00:56:55,838 --> 00:56:59,440
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a scary-ass game on the PC called Amnesia that's in Steam and stuff.

837
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:00,481
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not the same game.

838
00:57:01,242 --> 00:57:01,842
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a...

839
00:57:03,263 --> 00:57:17,965
[SPEAKER_04]: Artsy Anime type of game that's available on the PSP and there's lots of kissing like look they're making out these two are gonna make out and he's probably dreaming about somebody making out with him like there's just lots of kissy kissy in this game so

840
00:57:19,546 --> 00:57:22,648
[SPEAKER_04]: That's an adventure game on the PSP if you like kissy kissy stuff.

841
00:57:23,389 --> 00:57:27,472
[SPEAKER_04]: Growlancer 4 Over Reloaded also comes out on the PSP this week.

842
00:57:28,313 --> 00:57:31,275
[SPEAKER_04]: Boy, there's really just not a lot to get excited about right now.

843
00:57:31,295 --> 00:57:32,896
[SPEAKER_01]: They're already on the fourth one?

844
00:57:33,257 --> 00:57:33,477
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

845
00:57:33,877 --> 00:57:37,781
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow That's it for Japanese releases How about UK?

846
00:57:38,101 --> 00:57:58,299
[SPEAKER_02]: A few On the 17th we have Cubix HD From Dust for PC From Ubisoft Toy Soldier Civil War And on the 19th we have Xenoblade Chronicles For Wii That's it Xenoblade Chronicles might be of interest to some people A few, maybe

847
00:58:00,265 --> 00:58:11,230
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't be surprised if some of the Operation Rainfall people are like, okay, this week you have to buy a Wii system from the UK and buy Xenoblade just to show that we want it here.

848
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:14,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Just wait for it.

849
00:58:15,615 --> 00:58:17,196
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on, more news.

850
00:58:17,216 --> 00:58:21,177
[SPEAKER_04]: A couple more news stories for you guys in the classic game of the week coming up in just a little bit here.

851
00:58:23,278 --> 00:58:27,099
[SPEAKER_06]: So, a little more news about THQ.

852
00:58:27,139 --> 00:58:30,261
[SPEAKER_06]: We talked last week how they weren't too happy about...

853
00:58:31,241 --> 00:58:34,545
[SPEAKER_06]: THQ is not going to actively pursue development of the MX vs ATV franchise

854
00:58:49,805 --> 00:59:08,946
[SPEAKER_06]: and they were saying their latest game was kind of an experiment although it was a failed experiment and unfortunately releasing the title at a budget price didn't spur the extra sales they were hoping to make up on the back end with DLC and it was kind of not a good thing.

855
00:59:09,526 --> 00:59:12,727
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to continue on with that franchise.

856
00:59:13,707 --> 00:59:16,648
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, they've let go of 200 people.

857
00:59:19,749 --> 00:59:24,211
[SPEAKER_06]: They're shifting their development focus away from kids and licensed titles.

858
00:59:24,871 --> 00:59:35,358
[SPEAKER_06]: which I gotta admit, other than the WWE games and the occasional Saints Row and stuff like that, they do a lot of fucking kids games.

859
00:59:36,619 --> 00:59:44,544
[SPEAKER_06]: You probably won't see the shift away from it this holiday because they have a lot of fucking kids games coming out other than Saints Row and WWE.

860
00:59:45,224 --> 00:59:52,929
[SPEAKER_06]: Lots of U-Draw stuff, lots of the Marvel Super Heroes Squad, Chibi Marvel stuff, and

861
00:59:54,628 --> 00:59:57,410
[SPEAKER_06]: and Spongebob and all the Nicktoons stuff.

862
00:59:59,391 --> 00:59:59,591
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

863
01:00:01,292 --> 01:00:03,033
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's good that they're getting away from that.

864
01:00:03,693 --> 01:00:04,514
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, imagine that.

865
01:00:04,614 --> 01:00:07,515
[SPEAKER_04]: All those little shuffleware games didn't do so well at the end of the day.

866
01:00:08,496 --> 01:00:08,856
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

867
01:00:09,537 --> 01:00:09,897
[SPEAKER_04]: Too bad.

868
01:00:10,637 --> 01:00:10,917
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

869
01:00:11,358 --> 01:00:17,201
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on to, I guess I was joking about this earlier, but we do have a story about the whole Xenoblade and so forth.

870
01:00:17,241 --> 01:00:20,223
[SPEAKER_04]: It is coming out, of course, in Europe very soon, as DarkSakura just said.

871
01:00:21,444 --> 01:00:24,788
[SPEAKER_04]: Reggie Fils-Aimé made a comment to IGN this week about Xenoblade Chronicles.

872
01:00:25,169 --> 01:00:28,033
[SPEAKER_04]: Quote, we will be watching very closely what happens in Europe.

873
01:00:28,433 --> 01:00:37,345
[SPEAKER_04]: Certainly if there are business opportunities and positive consumer uptake from some of those titles, that will be great data for us to consider as we look at what to do with these titles.

874
01:00:38,649 --> 01:00:51,640
[SPEAKER_04]: Boy, if that's not a run-around-the-bush answer, if I've ever heard one, that's a, I'm not fucking telling you that the game is confirmed for here, I'm just gonna bullshit you with some of, that was the biggest pound of bullshit I've ever heard.

875
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:53,261
[SPEAKER_02]: Something smells.

876
01:00:53,361 --> 01:00:54,302
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so, whatever.

877
01:00:54,322 --> 01:00:55,523
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not Shermie's ass.

878
01:00:55,723 --> 01:00:56,104
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.

879
01:00:56,564 --> 01:01:02,109
[SPEAKER_04]: So, like, it's the nicest possible way he can say, please buy the game in Europe, but it doesn't mean we're gonna put it out here.

880
01:01:02,969 --> 01:01:04,451
[SPEAKER_06]: That pile of bullshit was like 400 Keurig.

881
01:01:04,471 --> 01:01:04,851
[SPEAKER_06]: Ha ha ha ha!

882
01:01:09,136 --> 01:01:10,858
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, Operation Rainfall.

883
01:01:10,898 --> 01:01:12,640
[SPEAKER_04]: That doesn't stop Operation Rainfall.

884
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:18,105
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not going to take no for an answer, not even for Reggie Fils-Aimé, who didn't really say no, but he didn't really say yes either.

885
01:01:18,906 --> 01:01:20,948
[SPEAKER_04]: Operation Rainfall is starting Phase 2.

886
01:01:21,669 --> 01:01:22,670
[SPEAKER_04]: Kicking it up a notch.

887
01:01:23,691 --> 01:01:25,393
[SPEAKER_04]: Phase 2, we're stepping it up.

888
01:01:25,413 --> 01:01:26,915
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to get these fucking games out here.

889
01:01:27,694 --> 01:01:29,615
[SPEAKER_06]: So would this be considered Plan B?

890
01:01:29,935 --> 01:01:37,820
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, this is Plan B. So here's Plan B. It's going to coincide with the August 19th launch of Xenoblade Chronicles in Europe.

891
01:01:38,380 --> 01:01:47,225
[SPEAKER_04]: To all residents in the regions of Europe and Oceania, says the organizers of Operation Rainfall, we encourage you to preorder and purchase it at your earliest convenience.

892
01:01:47,845 --> 01:01:51,187
[SPEAKER_04]: In the Americas, we encourage you to promote awareness of these titles.

893
01:01:51,588 --> 01:01:55,651
[SPEAKER_04]: Good sales abroad will be a strong indicator for the title making it to American shores.

894
01:01:55,791 --> 01:01:59,333
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, tell people in Europe to go buy the fucking game and buy it now.

895
01:01:59,654 --> 01:02:03,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't buy it used, buy it new so they get the sales, you know, try to sell a lot of copies of that game.

896
01:02:03,656 --> 01:02:04,437
[SPEAKER_02]: And send us a copy.

897
01:02:04,877 --> 01:02:06,639
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, yeah, hey, we'll take that.

898
01:02:07,079 --> 01:02:08,920
[SPEAKER_04]: But I wanted, oh wait, we couldn't play it on anything.

899
01:02:10,061 --> 01:02:12,843
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have a, do you have a, oh wait, you have a region free Wii, don't you?

900
01:02:13,143 --> 01:02:13,423
[SPEAKER_04]: Well...

901
01:02:15,547 --> 01:02:16,228
[SPEAKER_04]: Sort of.

902
01:02:17,189 --> 01:02:17,569
[SPEAKER_04]: Fair enough.

903
01:02:19,430 --> 01:02:23,654
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, they're going to be sending a rally of letters to Nintendo of America.

904
01:02:23,674 --> 01:02:29,099
[SPEAKER_04]: You're supposed to mail them from August 13th to August 17th so that they all get there about the same time.

905
01:02:29,539 --> 01:02:34,804
[SPEAKER_04]: This kind of reminds me of when everybody sent the peanuts to CBS to try and save Jericho.

906
01:02:34,844 --> 01:02:36,065
[SPEAKER_04]: But they're just sending letters.

907
01:02:37,225 --> 01:02:38,505
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to send something.

908
01:02:38,825 --> 01:02:40,646
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to not just send a letter.

909
01:02:40,746 --> 01:02:44,026
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to send something with it.

910
01:02:44,146 --> 01:02:47,067
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead of peanuts, what's something that they could send for Xenoblade?

911
01:02:47,427 --> 01:02:49,007
[SPEAKER_04]: Switchblades.

912
01:02:49,748 --> 01:02:50,508
[SPEAKER_06]: Boxcutters.

913
01:02:53,488 --> 01:02:54,528
[SPEAKER_04]: No, don't do that.

914
01:02:54,889 --> 01:02:55,529
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just kidding.

915
01:02:55,569 --> 01:02:56,149
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't do that.

916
01:02:56,189 --> 01:02:56,649
[SPEAKER_04]: Good lord.

917
01:02:57,669 --> 01:02:59,909
[SPEAKER_06]: They will look at you at the post office funny if you do that.

918
01:03:03,559 --> 01:03:05,440
[SPEAKER_04]: Send them hand-drawn pictures of knives.

919
01:03:07,081 --> 01:03:07,701
[SPEAKER_04]: No, don't do that.

920
01:03:07,741 --> 01:03:08,162
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't do that.

921
01:03:09,602 --> 01:03:09,923
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

922
01:03:10,363 --> 01:03:11,223
[SPEAKER_04]: What could you send?

923
01:03:11,503 --> 01:03:12,924
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to turn that over to the chat room.

924
01:03:13,204 --> 01:03:17,907
[SPEAKER_04]: That would remind somebody of Xenoblade or I guess you could say The Last Story or Pandora's Tower.

925
01:03:18,487 --> 01:03:20,789
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there like some other factor?

926
01:03:21,109 --> 01:03:23,130
[SPEAKER_02]: Get a whole bunch of copies of Xenogears.

927
01:03:24,557 --> 01:03:26,038
[SPEAKER_02]: from PlayStation the best?

928
01:03:26,798 --> 01:03:28,139
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

929
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:30,720
[SPEAKER_04]: What about like letter X's?

930
01:03:31,441 --> 01:03:37,844
[SPEAKER_04]: Like they should cut out the letter X from all their magazines and put them in an envelope so that when they open it up, just X's fly everywhere.

931
01:03:38,245 --> 01:03:39,685
[SPEAKER_04]: And the X means Xenoblade.

932
01:03:39,946 --> 01:03:40,766
[SPEAKER_04]: How about bees?

933
01:03:42,507 --> 01:03:42,807
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

934
01:03:44,228 --> 01:03:45,769
[SPEAKER_06]: Because the bees would fly everywhere.

935
01:03:49,144 --> 01:03:50,826
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a little more daring.

936
01:03:51,026 --> 01:03:51,586
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, fine.

937
01:03:51,706 --> 01:03:53,408
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to open the rest of those letters.

938
01:03:53,468 --> 01:03:55,310
[SPEAKER_06]: They're all buzzing over there.

939
01:03:58,373 --> 01:04:01,916
[SPEAKER_06]: I just thought it was the one, but I'm pretty sure there's bees in all of those.

940
01:04:03,858 --> 01:04:06,120
[SPEAKER_05]: This package is buzzing and it's angry.

941
01:04:07,721 --> 01:04:09,023
[SPEAKER_05]: Make it stop, Reggie.

942
01:04:12,492 --> 01:04:13,574
[SPEAKER_05]: Fine, send them bees.

943
01:04:13,834 --> 01:04:14,155
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

944
01:04:14,215 --> 01:04:18,522
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm pretty sure bees wouldn't survive the trip, though, but you could try.

945
01:04:18,703 --> 01:04:19,664
[SPEAKER_06]: Put holes in the box.

946
01:04:21,067 --> 01:04:22,289
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, we're sending in a box?

947
01:04:23,130 --> 01:04:24,452
[SPEAKER_06]: You can fit a lot of bees in a box.

948
01:04:27,253 --> 01:04:28,294
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't send them bees!

949
01:04:47,105 --> 01:04:47,866
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's what you need to do.

950
01:04:48,006 --> 01:04:54,610
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to just beat the shit out of a water right now, buy Nintendo stock and then complain as an investor.

951
01:04:54,751 --> 01:04:55,751
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what you need to do.

952
01:04:55,791 --> 01:05:04,197
[SPEAKER_04]: If you really want to kick Nintendo in the balls right now, become an investor of Nintendo stock and then say, as an investor, I feel that you need to bring Xenoblade out.

953
01:05:04,317 --> 01:05:06,599
[SPEAKER_06]: And from what I hear, the stock prices keep dropping.

954
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:08,681
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be cheap real soon.

955
01:05:10,642 --> 01:05:12,503
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, now the chatroom has a great suggestion.

956
01:05:12,603 --> 01:05:13,584
[SPEAKER_04]: Send them porn.

957
01:05:13,904 --> 01:05:16,205
[SPEAKER_04]: Because when you think X, it's XXX.

958
01:05:16,506 --> 01:05:18,247
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's not going to work.

959
01:05:18,827 --> 01:05:19,508
[SPEAKER_04]: Send them porn.

960
01:05:20,448 --> 01:05:24,371
[SPEAKER_06]: Send them... What is it?

961
01:05:24,491 --> 01:05:28,834
[SPEAKER_05]: Frisbee in chat says, each one of these stings is how you make us feel.

962
01:05:32,344 --> 01:05:35,272
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, because you know I'm thinking of that GIF that's out there on the internet.

963
01:05:35,292 --> 01:05:38,340
[SPEAKER_04]: The animated GIF file of Oprah opening the box.

964
01:05:38,420 --> 01:05:39,323
[SPEAKER_04]: It says, Bees!

965
01:05:39,403 --> 01:05:40,305
[SPEAKER_04]: It was on the Conan show.

966
01:05:41,673 --> 01:05:43,014
[SPEAKER_04]: TigerClaw, find me that gif.

967
01:05:43,614 --> 01:05:44,455
[SPEAKER_04]: Post it in chat.

968
01:05:44,475 --> 01:05:45,516
[SPEAKER_04]: That's even better.

969
01:05:45,756 --> 01:05:47,277
[SPEAKER_06]: You send it like the Riddler.

970
01:05:47,337 --> 01:05:49,959
[SPEAKER_06]: You know how the Riddler would send you little boxes with question marks on it?

971
01:05:50,339 --> 01:05:54,201
[SPEAKER_06]: But they have a box with a question mark on it in the Mario universe.

972
01:05:54,282 --> 01:05:56,423
[SPEAKER_06]: It fits, and you fit that with the bees.

973
01:05:56,463 --> 01:05:57,043
[SPEAKER_06]: That's good.

974
01:05:57,364 --> 01:06:02,787
[SPEAKER_06]: Or you can have the treasure chest from Zelda, so when they open it, it's all, do-do-do-do, bees!

975
01:06:08,737 --> 01:06:11,580
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the note says, each of these stings is how you make us feel.

976
01:06:12,406 --> 01:06:13,167
[SPEAKER_06]: or Bees in a Jar.

977
01:06:13,527 --> 01:06:14,708
[SPEAKER_06]: Just like, you know, Zelda.

978
01:06:15,989 --> 01:06:19,711
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all... I'm really going with the bees here.

979
01:06:19,751 --> 01:06:20,932
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the bees are a really good idea.

980
01:06:20,972 --> 01:06:22,313
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh god, they keep sending bees!

981
01:06:22,453 --> 01:06:24,615
[SPEAKER_05]: Throw them in the fountain and see if you get super bees.

982
01:06:25,936 --> 01:06:26,777
[SPEAKER_06]: Super bees.

983
01:06:27,057 --> 01:06:27,557
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, look.

984
01:06:28,018 --> 01:06:29,078
[SPEAKER_04]: There's more to this story.

985
01:06:29,138 --> 01:06:30,239
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut up about the bees already.

986
01:06:30,659 --> 01:06:30,940
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

987
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:36,964
[SPEAKER_04]: On August 19th, there's one more big thing that Operation Rainfall is going to be doing.

988
01:06:36,984 --> 01:06:37,344
[SPEAKER_04]: You ready?

989
01:06:37,965 --> 01:06:40,407
[SPEAKER_04]: As a show of an interest in RPGs,

990
01:06:41,148 --> 01:06:46,906
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody on August 19th should purchase Final Fantasy on Virtual Console.

991
01:06:48,356 --> 01:07:17,794
[SPEAKER_04]: but if you already have it you should gift the money to somebody else or donate to Child's Play which I'm not going to make fun of that idea I think donating to Child's Play is always a good idea I'm not quite sure how that gets the point across that you want Xenoblade but okay whatever gets you to donate to a good charity that's fine as far as buying Final Fantasy on the virtual console I think your money might just be better spent giving the money to Child's Play in the name of bringing Xenoblade to the Wii

992
01:07:19,471 --> 01:07:30,193
[SPEAKER_04]: How is buying Final Fantasy on Virtual Console and increasing Square Enix's coffers going to prove to Reggie that we want Xenoblade?

993
01:07:31,873 --> 01:07:33,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, can you help explain this to me?

994
01:07:33,474 --> 01:07:34,434
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I'm not understanding.

995
01:07:36,734 --> 01:07:43,615
[SPEAKER_06]: Well... They have blades in both of them.

996
01:07:44,335 --> 01:07:46,876
[SPEAKER_06]: And Square Enix made Xenogears...

997
01:07:49,232 --> 01:07:51,413
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's a terrible idea.

998
01:07:52,654 --> 01:07:53,714
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you know what's going to happen?

999
01:07:53,954 --> 01:07:56,195
[SPEAKER_06]: Because once again, this is the problem.

1000
01:07:57,516 --> 01:08:08,440
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, there's lots of people on forums, lots of people on forums that are complaining that Xenoblade is not coming to the United States.

1001
01:08:09,141 --> 01:08:14,363
[SPEAKER_06]: But lots of people on forums also said, MadWorld is a fucking awesome game and I'm going to buy it.

1002
01:08:15,563 --> 01:08:16,184
[SPEAKER_06]: See, that's the problem.

1003
01:08:16,584 --> 01:08:20,467
[SPEAKER_06]: People on forums, you know what your numbers are, right?

1004
01:08:20,587 --> 01:08:21,748
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not 100,000.

1005
01:08:22,088 --> 01:08:24,530
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not maybe even 10,000.

1006
01:08:25,071 --> 01:08:28,914
[SPEAKER_04]: And most people that post on forums that say they're going to buy it don't really buy it.

1007
01:08:28,954 --> 01:08:29,854
[SPEAKER_04]: They end up pirating it.

1008
01:08:31,015 --> 01:08:34,938
[SPEAKER_06]: You're maybe a few thousand people that want this game.

1009
01:08:35,319 --> 01:08:39,962
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm sorry, a game that only sells a few thousand copies is a failure.

1010
01:08:40,222 --> 01:08:40,523
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

1011
01:08:42,464 --> 01:09:07,707
[SPEAKER_06]: it's just not gonna happen you know what just save your money save your time wait for E3 next year and maybe they'll announce it but in the meantime if you really do want to spend like I don't know how much it is for Final Fantasy 7 bucks you can buy a lot of bees for seven dollars I'm telling you I think it's a great idea and you know what hey okay fine if you don't want to send them live bees because that might be a terrorist attack or terror threat or something like that

1012
01:09:08,513 --> 01:09:10,176
[SPEAKER_06]: You know how they're all insensitive about that kind of stuff.

1013
01:09:10,196 --> 01:09:11,058
[SPEAKER_05]: But bees pollinate!

1014
01:09:11,699 --> 01:09:15,767
[SPEAKER_06]: You can send them like a chocolate-covered... They don't sell chocolate-covered bees, I'd imagine.

1015
01:09:17,531 --> 01:09:20,477
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe like... Pictures of bees?

1016
01:09:21,407 --> 01:09:23,248
[SPEAKER_06]: Send them Mario with his head cut off.

1017
01:09:23,348 --> 01:09:26,689
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1018
01:09:27,509 --> 01:09:28,669
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's what you need to do.

1019
01:09:29,089 --> 01:09:34,391
[SPEAKER_06]: Spend that $10 or whatever that you would have spent on Final Fantasy or whatever.

1020
01:09:35,691 --> 01:09:38,512
[SPEAKER_06]: And donate it to charity and know that your money went to something good.

1021
01:09:38,572 --> 01:09:39,372
[SPEAKER_06]: Or go buy lunch.

1022
01:09:39,492 --> 01:09:43,473
[SPEAKER_06]: Or go just rent a porno or something like that.

1023
01:09:43,573 --> 01:09:44,613
[SPEAKER_06]: Fucking chill the fuck out.

1024
01:09:44,853 --> 01:09:46,414
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you're getting your...

1025
01:09:47,034 --> 01:09:50,378
[SPEAKER_06]: All up in arms about like some... One damn game.

1026
01:09:50,639 --> 01:09:52,721
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, these are the best games on the Wii.

1027
01:09:52,781 --> 01:09:53,763
[SPEAKER_06]: The best RPGs.

1028
01:09:54,023 --> 01:09:55,325
[SPEAKER_06]: The Wii is over, okay?

1029
01:09:55,385 --> 01:09:56,286
[SPEAKER_06]: The Wii is done.

1030
01:09:56,526 --> 01:09:57,567
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty much done.

1031
01:09:58,008 --> 01:10:01,793
[SPEAKER_06]: It's... You're just like trying to get this last good game out before the Wii is done.

1032
01:10:01,913 --> 01:10:02,674
[SPEAKER_06]: It's done, okay?

1033
01:10:02,874 --> 01:10:04,296
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going on to the Wii U.

1034
01:10:04,875 --> 01:10:24,669
[SPEAKER_06]: so just get over it better games are out there better games will be coming out there so they didn't bring a hardcore game to the Wii even though they said oh we're catering to everybody just get over it they don't care about you they don't care what you want otherwise you know Earthbound would be out you know Earthbound 3 or Mother 3 or whatever the fuck that is

1035
01:10:24,949 --> 01:10:27,031
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkTetsuya points out, you know, Mario did have a bee power-up in Mario Galaxy.

1036
01:10:47,350 --> 01:10:47,570
[SPEAKER_06]: See?

1037
01:10:47,690 --> 01:10:47,990
[SPEAKER_06]: Right there.

1038
01:10:48,010 --> 01:10:49,212
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo loves bees.

1039
01:10:49,692 --> 01:10:56,019
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to end this conversation on a comment that's about as good as this whole effort.

1040
01:10:57,942 --> 01:11:02,967
[SPEAKER_06]: If you don't like bees because they fly around, it might be hard to catch.

1041
01:11:02,987 --> 01:11:03,428
[SPEAKER_06]: Scorpions also work.

1042
01:11:03,448 --> 01:11:03,648
[SPEAKER_06]: Stop it.

1043
01:11:06,451 --> 01:11:10,994
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, I'm going to end on this comment from our chatroom at chat.org You can get candy covered scorpions.

1044
01:11:11,554 --> 01:11:12,114
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are safe.

1045
01:11:12,394 --> 01:11:16,737
[SPEAKER_04]: Spazinator says, Nintendo would boil the bees to make BT.

1046
01:11:17,437 --> 01:11:19,838
[SPEAKER_04]: I heard BT makes for a good buzz.

1047
01:11:26,502 --> 01:11:28,083
[SPEAKER_04]: Just going to let that joke settle for a minute.

1048
01:11:30,168 --> 01:11:31,550
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go to the classic game of the week.

1049
01:11:33,351 --> 01:11:44,103
[SPEAKER_06]: Every week here on Orange Lounge Radio, DarkSakura dives into the gaming vault and finds... Before we start, Breakman says, so Loki thinks trying to hurt the developers is a better idea than trying to bribe them.

1050
01:11:45,164 --> 01:11:47,807
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not saying it to the developers, we're saying it to Nintendo.

1051
01:11:47,907 --> 01:11:49,168
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not trying to hurt them.

1052
01:11:49,469 --> 01:11:52,192
[SPEAKER_06]: The developers are far away, safe from the bees.

1053
01:11:55,451 --> 01:12:18,857
[SPEAKER_04]: by the way, I believe DarkSakura posted that gif on Tumblr for those that are listening on the podcast I like having the Tumblr so when funny shit comes up on the show we can talk about it on Tumblr remove that thing that cross posts everything to Twitter though I don't think I ever set that up it's doing it see if you can find it classic game of the week yay

1054
01:12:21,338 --> 01:12:25,180
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura goes in the classic gaming vault, finds a game she thinks, hey, you kids ought to be playing it this week.

1055
01:12:25,980 --> 01:12:27,721
[SPEAKER_04]: Forget the last story.

1056
01:12:28,362 --> 01:12:31,083
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the only story you fucking need.

1057
01:12:31,103 --> 01:12:33,284
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week this week?

1058
01:12:33,484 --> 01:12:35,405
[SPEAKER_02]: Warcraft 3, Reign of Chaos.

1059
01:12:36,466 --> 01:12:36,766
[SPEAKER_04]: Addict?

1060
01:12:37,206 --> 01:12:41,108
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not really, because I don't like real-time strategy games.

1061
01:12:41,588 --> 01:12:42,728
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm trying to play it.

1062
01:12:43,469 --> 01:12:47,230
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to, so I thought I would bring it up.

1063
01:12:48,470 --> 01:12:50,711
[SPEAKER_02]: This is, of course, the third in a row.

1064
01:12:51,171 --> 01:12:57,753
[SPEAKER_02]: The first one was Warcraft Orcs and Humans, and the second one was Tides of Darkness, and this one's Reign of Chaos.

1065
01:12:57,773 --> 01:12:59,693
[SPEAKER_02]: Oops, sorry.

1066
01:12:59,733 --> 01:13:05,895
[SPEAKER_02]: The music one that I put up there is actually from the expansion, The Frozen Throne.

1067
01:13:06,155 --> 01:13:06,415
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

1068
01:13:06,435 --> 01:13:06,595
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

1069
01:13:07,228 --> 01:13:13,532
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, yeah, it did come out, um, and it had, um, it actually was released on July 3rd, 2002.

1070
01:13:14,393 --> 01:13:20,057
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's the second sequel to, um, you know, as I said, Warcraft, Orcs, and Humans.

1071
01:13:20,957 --> 01:13:24,880
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it had an expansion pack called the Frozen Drone that came out on July 1st, 2003.

1072
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:27,582
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have four playable races this time.

1073
01:13:27,602 --> 01:13:31,564
[SPEAKER_02]: You have Orcs and Humans, um, and you also have Night Elves and Undead.

1074
01:13:32,725 --> 01:13:35,987
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, it's sort of laid out like StarCraft.

1075
01:13:38,248 --> 01:13:42,029
[SPEAKER_02]: You also have other races in the expansion.

1076
01:13:42,049 --> 01:13:47,931
[SPEAKER_02]: You get the Draenei and the Naga, who are really elves.

1077
01:13:49,051 --> 01:13:49,651
[SPEAKER_02]: They suck.

1078
01:13:50,351 --> 01:13:52,532
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, you've got multiplayer.

1079
01:13:52,892 --> 01:13:54,032
[SPEAKER_02]: You can play on the internet.

1080
01:13:54,212 --> 01:13:57,533
[SPEAKER_02]: You can play against the computer.

1081
01:13:57,673 --> 01:14:02,214
[SPEAKER_02]: You can even later on mod your levels and do customized levels.

1082
01:14:03,915 --> 01:14:23,004
[SPEAKER_02]: The proper storylines basically is if you've done the orc campaign on Warcraft and the human campaigns on Warcraft 2, so that would be Tides of Darkness and Beyond the Dark Portal, then those lead into Warcraft 3.

1083
01:14:24,105 --> 01:14:36,814
[SPEAKER_02]: So it sold 4.5 million units, well shipped I should say, and it sold over a million within a month and it is one of the game beer ones listed.

1084
01:14:36,954 --> 01:14:41,617
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically it's a, you know, like I said, real time strategy.

1085
01:14:42,317 --> 01:14:47,601
[SPEAKER_02]: You have the stuff called the Black Mask that covers places that you haven't explored but when you explore it goes away.

1086
01:14:48,001 --> 01:14:59,489
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you move too far away, then you get the fog of war, which makes you can't see what troops are doing and what building construction is going on, but you can still see the terrain.

1087
01:15:00,089 --> 01:15:04,292
[SPEAKER_02]: I call that saving space for, you know, rendering, but that's another story.

1088
01:15:06,674 --> 01:15:08,615
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to get your different resources.

1089
01:15:08,715 --> 01:15:10,576
[SPEAKER_02]: You need gold, lumber, and food.

1090
01:15:11,977 --> 01:15:39,242
[SPEAKER_02]: and um you have to have those to make buildings and then food determines the number of units you can control at any given time so basically the more troops you can feed the more you can have out and play you also have creeps which are controlled by the computer and they guard different areas like gold mines and buildings um you can kill them for gold experience and special items and you have a day night cycle that was also introduced for this game um

1091
01:15:40,543 --> 01:15:40,863
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

1092
01:15:58,067 --> 01:15:58,928
[SPEAKER_02]: Limitations as well.

1093
01:16:00,349 --> 01:16:03,872
[SPEAKER_02]: So, with this one, you also get something called Heroes.

1094
01:16:04,673 --> 01:16:10,618
[SPEAKER_02]: So, when you have an enemy unit killed, your hero will gain experience points and can level up as far as 10.

1095
01:16:11,599 --> 01:16:15,542
[SPEAKER_02]: And they also get new spells, kind of gets like an RPG element to it.

1096
01:16:16,583 --> 01:16:20,847
[SPEAKER_02]: And they can boost their units that way, and they'll get ultimate skills!

1097
01:16:20,907 --> 01:16:21,367
[SPEAKER_02]: Horrible.

1098
01:16:22,148 --> 01:16:24,269
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically, you've got your different campaign modes.

1099
01:16:24,309 --> 01:16:31,431
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got five campaigns, including the prologue, that introduces the different races.

1100
01:16:31,471 --> 01:16:34,972
[SPEAKER_02]: There's two orc campaigns, one human, one undead, and one night elf.

1101
01:16:35,572 --> 01:16:37,992
[SPEAKER_02]: They have different chapters, which are kind of like your missions.

1102
01:16:38,893 --> 01:16:43,094
[SPEAKER_02]: But you do not have briefings, as you did in the earlier games.

1103
01:16:43,614 --> 01:16:46,075
[SPEAKER_02]: It just sort of comes out in a series of quests.

1104
01:16:46,975 --> 01:16:51,016
[SPEAKER_02]: And the story unfolds through cinematics and cutscenes.

1105
01:16:52,137 --> 01:16:55,402
[SPEAKER_02]: and you get your different objectives as you progress through the game.

1106
01:16:55,502 --> 01:16:58,707
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of like how World of Warcraft is doing now.

1107
01:17:00,369 --> 01:17:03,794
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems to me it's exactly a good transition.

1108
01:17:04,876 --> 01:17:05,496
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway...

1109
01:17:07,990 --> 01:17:10,452
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

1110
01:17:27,708 --> 01:17:31,312
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go against your friends and other people on Battle.net.

1111
01:17:31,332 --> 01:17:33,254
[SPEAKER_02]: You had different gateways.

1112
01:17:33,795 --> 01:17:45,348
[SPEAKER_02]: You had your Azeroth, which was the eastern U.S., Lorydron, which was the west United States, Northrend for Europe, and Kalimdor for Asia.

1113
01:17:46,209 --> 01:17:46,429
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

1114
01:17:47,851 --> 01:17:52,154
[SPEAKER_02]: You could actually play anonymously with other people.

1115
01:17:52,494 --> 01:17:53,615
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called matchmaking.

1116
01:17:54,576 --> 01:17:57,818
[SPEAKER_02]: So you could have different battles against random people.

1117
01:17:58,719 --> 01:18:04,183
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there were also scores and standings that were marked on the ladder.

1118
01:18:05,204 --> 01:18:07,746
[SPEAKER_02]: So as far as the game goes, I'm not going to tell too much of the story.

1119
01:18:08,546 --> 01:18:10,768
[SPEAKER_02]: I prefer to paraphrase it as Arthas is a bitch.

1120
01:18:11,909 --> 01:18:12,389
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't you think?

1121
01:18:13,931 --> 01:18:14,491
[SPEAKER_04]: About sums it up.

1122
01:18:15,999 --> 01:18:28,266
[SPEAKER_02]: Arthas decides he's going to get all big and bad and burn a bunch of people to death and then get some sword and give his soul up for his sword and then become the Lich King's bitch.

1123
01:18:29,707 --> 01:18:39,953
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he does a whole bunch of awful shit like, you know, killing his dad and killing a bunch of other people and turning Sylvanas into, you know, a banshee and...

1124
01:18:40,513 --> 01:18:41,956
[SPEAKER_02]: All kinds of other crap.

1125
01:18:42,197 --> 01:18:47,267
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, it's basically Arthas is a bitch, the game.

1126
01:18:48,887 --> 01:19:12,408
[SPEAKER_02]: but you also find a few people that went to MIA in earlier games what happened to them and of course for anyone who's playing World of Warcraft now pretty much all these characters that were in this game play into you can find them in World of Warcraft or they've been dead and are affecting the game but it's all built on what went on in this game

1127
01:19:14,182 --> 01:19:15,643
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it has great sound.

1128
01:19:15,683 --> 01:19:19,444
[SPEAKER_02]: You could actually, if you got the limited edition, it came with a soundtrack.

1129
01:19:20,604 --> 01:19:25,086
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, there are different types of, uh, you know, music for the different, uh, races.

1130
01:19:25,126 --> 01:19:29,887
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the one that I just, we were just hearing was the Night Elf theme, which is pretty good music.

1131
01:19:30,927 --> 01:19:31,047
[SPEAKER_02]: Um.

1132
01:19:33,188 --> 01:19:35,369
[SPEAKER_04]: It's at the end though, so I'm going to switch to the Undead music.

1133
01:19:35,869 --> 01:19:35,949
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1134
01:19:35,969 --> 01:19:36,089
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1135
01:19:38,294 --> 01:19:46,261
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and like I said, you could also, there was a world editor that you could change different events and change different things.

1136
01:19:46,381 --> 01:19:58,230
[SPEAKER_02]: You could download each other's maps, and there were also third-party developers that had different tools that came out, like different spreadsheets and customizing skins, all kinds of different cool stuff.

1137
01:19:59,271 --> 01:20:12,418
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically the game, there was this epic bundle that came with the soundtrack, instruction manual, the Art of Warcraft book, and lithographic prints.

1138
01:20:13,539 --> 01:20:19,742
[SPEAKER_02]: And you could also get the battle chest, which had Reign of Chaos with the Frozen Throne in box.

1139
01:20:20,482 --> 01:20:21,884
[SPEAKER_02]: and the guides from Brady Games.

1140
01:20:21,924 --> 01:20:26,148
[SPEAKER_02]: There was also an exclusive gift set that had a cinematic DVD and a bunch of other crap.

1141
01:20:27,148 --> 01:20:35,837
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was also, for anyone who played Warcraft the board game, it actually was based heavily off of Warcraft 3.

1142
01:20:37,597 --> 01:20:50,159
[SPEAKER_02]: It got a 93.09% at GameRankings.com and basically it's just considered one of the greatest game, I'd say modern games of all time.

1143
01:20:50,319 --> 01:20:52,020
[SPEAKER_02]: So, there you go.

1144
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:53,980
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1145
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:57,181
[SPEAKER_04]: There it is folks, your classic game of the week, Warcraft 3.

1146
01:20:58,101 --> 01:20:58,901
[SPEAKER_02]: Arthas is a bitch.

1147
01:20:59,701 --> 01:21:04,502
[SPEAKER_04]: Arthas is a bitch and as SalaciousPop says in chat, Arthas is a bitch and Illidan needs to stop listening to Linkin Park.

1148
01:21:05,042 --> 01:21:05,322
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes!

1149
01:21:06,872 --> 01:21:07,332
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

1150
01:21:07,733 --> 01:21:10,534
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, that's going to do it for Part A here of Orange Launch Radio.

1151
01:21:10,554 --> 01:21:11,395
[SPEAKER_04]: But don't go anywhere, guys.

1152
01:21:11,415 --> 01:21:13,376
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got plenty more to come of the show tonight.

1153
01:21:14,117 --> 01:21:23,343
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to move into Part B, talk a little bit about Google+, more Nintendo news, and, of course, Mailbag, FUs, tweets, and calls, all when we come back with more of Orange Launch Radio.

1154
01:21:29,355 --> 01:21:31,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

1155
01:21:31,796 --> 01:21:42,819
[SPEAKER_04]: We are live, of course, on this Sunday evening, August the 14th of 2011, with the 424th episode of our show, taping live at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.

1156
01:21:42,839 --> 01:21:51,602
[SPEAKER_04]: You missed a fun Part A that was full of Bs, but we are going to continue on with Part B of our show right now, and we're going to start off with some rapid-fire news.

1157
01:21:51,722 --> 01:21:52,042
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

1158
01:21:52,722 --> 01:21:53,682
[SPEAKER_06]: This game is hard.

1159
01:21:54,002 --> 01:21:54,383
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways.

1160
01:21:54,703 --> 01:21:55,443
[SPEAKER_06]: What game?

1161
01:21:55,463 --> 01:21:57,243
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you're still playing VVVVV over there, right?

1162
01:21:57,644 --> 01:21:59,024
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I had to dodge the lies.

1163
01:21:59,984 --> 01:22:24,578
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so this is interesting, uh, Kojima, of course, during his podcast, they had done, um, a Snatcher Universe radio drama, which was, I guess, entitled Suda51's, uh, Sedature, um, and it's now being offered as a free download, and if you want something a little bit more physical, you can get a CD that'll be sold later on, um, I guess to pay the voice actors, um,

1164
01:22:25,438 --> 01:22:50,727
[SPEAKER_06]: and I guess the voice drum also featured a lot of the people that did voices in Metal Gear so that's kind of cool and so yeah check that out and if you're looking for more information on that I believe you can just check out his actual podcast it's www.kjp.kanami.jp and I think it's the Hideo blog on there

1165
01:22:52,147 --> 01:23:07,330
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, Motorstorm Apocalypse is getting a brand new update and they're adding make a mode support, which I guess allows you to customize, you know, the vehicles, um, and some of the other options that are in the game.

1166
01:23:08,210 --> 01:23:12,991
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, you can tweak everything, including you can just, that's awesome.

1167
01:23:13,411 --> 01:23:16,551
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, you can disable brakes, you can disable gravity.

1168
01:23:17,852 --> 01:23:20,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, sweet, a racing game with no brakes.

1169
01:23:20,072 --> 01:23:20,372
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1170
01:23:20,672 --> 01:23:21,553
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds kind of cool.

1171
01:23:22,894 --> 01:23:24,495
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'd have to check that out.

1172
01:23:24,815 --> 01:23:31,621
[SPEAKER_06]: They also added PlayStation Move support for, I guess, if you wanted to do the old Wii steering type thing on there.

1173
01:23:33,062 --> 01:23:36,745
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if I'd recommend that, but, you know, that option's there at least.

1174
01:23:38,086 --> 01:23:39,327
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's out there now.

1175
01:23:39,487 --> 01:23:41,689
[SPEAKER_06]: So just connect to the internet and pop in the game.

1176
01:23:43,867 --> 01:23:49,431
[SPEAKER_06]: and then Child of Eden unfortunately has been delayed a week but I think it's kind of cool because they're getting 3D support now.

1177
01:23:49,871 --> 01:23:52,493
[SPEAKER_06]: So you'll be able to check out the game September 27th.

1178
01:23:52,533 --> 01:23:54,895
[SPEAKER_06]: It's PlayStation 3 though, right?

1179
01:23:54,995 --> 01:23:56,696
[SPEAKER_04]: The PlayStation 3 version, yes.

1180
01:23:56,976 --> 01:23:59,158
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course it will feature move controls as well which I...

1181
01:24:00,359 --> 01:24:03,123
[SPEAKER_06]: To be honest, I think that's going to be way better than what the Kinect was.

1182
01:24:04,405 --> 01:24:06,668
[SPEAKER_06]: I would be kind of curious to check it out on the PS3.

1183
01:24:07,449 --> 01:24:11,234
[SPEAKER_06]: But 3D, man, I can only imagine that game is going to be just amazing.

1184
01:24:11,255 --> 01:24:13,538
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's going to be kind of a trip in 3D.

1185
01:24:15,240 --> 01:24:18,403
[SPEAKER_04]: Do I know anyone with a 3D TV and a PlayStation 3?

1186
01:24:18,763 --> 01:24:20,545
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't think of anyone off the top of my head.

1187
01:24:21,125 --> 01:24:24,428
[SPEAKER_04]: 3D televisions haven't exactly cracked into the mainstream.

1188
01:24:24,448 --> 01:24:25,509
[SPEAKER_04]: We have one in my work.

1189
01:24:26,330 --> 01:24:27,491
[SPEAKER_06]: It's actually a Sony TV.

1190
01:24:27,611 --> 01:24:29,893
[SPEAKER_04]: I've really contemplated getting one of those monitors, though.

1191
01:24:29,913 --> 01:24:30,553
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not gonna lie.

1192
01:24:31,514 --> 01:24:32,275
[SPEAKER_04]: They're pretty decent.

1193
01:24:32,315 --> 01:24:33,196
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's about that big.

1194
01:24:33,576 --> 01:24:35,817
[SPEAKER_04]: Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker

1195
01:25:02,246 --> 01:25:05,727
[SPEAKER_04]: It will have a download code, however, for the first Metal Gear Solid.

1196
01:25:05,767 --> 01:25:07,668
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't believe it's up-resed or anything like that, though.

1197
01:25:07,688 --> 01:25:09,989
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just pretty much the original PlayStation game.

1198
01:25:10,429 --> 01:25:19,453
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, the overseas version, which would include the one that's going to come out in America, it will not have the download for the first Metal Gear Solid, but it will have the HD version of Peace Walker.

1199
01:25:19,793 --> 01:25:22,134
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I don't know why the difference is, but there you go.

1200
01:25:23,254 --> 01:25:28,376
[SPEAKER_04]: Also of note, Metal Gear Solid 3 HD is going to be the subsistence version of the game.

1201
01:25:28,756 --> 01:25:31,157
[SPEAKER_04]: It has the user control camera and all that stuff.

1202
01:25:31,977 --> 01:25:36,659
[SPEAKER_04]: It also has emulated MSX versions of Metal Gear 1 and 2.

1203
01:25:37,500 --> 01:25:41,781
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty awesome because that was all the subsistence versions of Metal Gear Solid 3 had that.

1204
01:25:41,821 --> 01:25:43,582
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's pretty rad.

1205
01:25:43,742 --> 01:25:51,565
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if that means that we'll see them here in America because those games were never translated to English because the MSX was never out in America.

1206
01:25:51,646 --> 01:25:53,346
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know how that's all going to work.

1207
01:25:53,386 --> 01:25:54,267
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be very interesting.

1208
01:25:54,287 --> 01:25:57,268
[SPEAKER_04]: I really hope we can play those games in their original MSX format.

1209
01:25:59,609 --> 01:26:04,031
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, by the way, there's a huge difference between Metal Gear 2 and Snakes Revenge, by the way, if you didn't know that.

1210
01:26:04,411 --> 01:26:09,173
[SPEAKER_04]: Snakes Revenge was completely done in America, and Kojima was not involved with that at all.

1211
01:26:09,773 --> 01:26:16,776
[SPEAKER_04]: But there was an official Metal Gear 2, I'm not talking solid, Metal Gear 2 on the MSX oh so many years ago.

1212
01:26:17,156 --> 01:26:17,796
[SPEAKER_04]: We never saw it here.

1213
01:26:18,416 --> 01:26:19,357
[SPEAKER_01]: There are fan translations.

1214
01:26:20,297 --> 01:26:25,158
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe, well, I don't think they'd use a fan translation, but I would, man, I really hope the MSX version show up.

1215
01:26:25,218 --> 01:26:25,538
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

1216
01:26:25,898 --> 01:26:30,979
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, Metal Gear Solid 2 HD release would also be based on Subsistence.

1217
01:26:32,060 --> 01:26:36,581
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess he really meant to say the Substance version of the game because there wasn't a Subsistence, but whatever.

1218
01:26:37,541 --> 01:26:37,921
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't know.

1219
01:26:38,001 --> 01:26:38,981
[SPEAKER_04]: No, what's Subsistence?

1220
01:26:39,541 --> 01:26:40,081
[SPEAKER_04]: Subsistence.

1221
01:26:40,241 --> 01:26:40,521
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it?

1222
01:26:40,661 --> 01:26:40,841
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1223
01:26:41,362 --> 01:26:41,782
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, whatever.

1224
01:26:42,182 --> 01:26:47,603
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, those games will be in HD and we'll have all the trophy support and all that good stuff.

1225
01:26:48,403 --> 01:26:51,305
[SPEAKER_04]: A game that you might have forgot about, but it's still coming, you know, eventually.

1226
01:26:51,665 --> 01:26:53,246
[SPEAKER_04]: Sonic 4, Episode 2.

1227
01:26:54,187 --> 01:26:54,547
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember?

1228
01:26:54,567 --> 01:26:59,130
[SPEAKER_04]: Because there was Sonic 4, Episode 1, and it kind of came out, and the whole internet was all, no one care.

1229
01:26:59,950 --> 01:27:05,494
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people thought that Sonic 4 was pretty much dead, now that, you know, Sonic Generations is kind of going and so forth.

1230
01:27:05,854 --> 01:27:11,898
[SPEAKER_04]: But nope, Sega West CEO Mike Hayes said that new info regarding the second chapter should be out soon.

1231
01:27:13,627 --> 01:27:15,731
[SPEAKER_04]: No date, just soon.

1232
01:27:15,971 --> 01:27:18,275
[SPEAKER_04]: Just basically saying, hey, the game hasn't fallen off the radar.

1233
01:27:18,355 --> 01:27:20,519
[SPEAKER_04]: It will come out, you know, eventually.

1234
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:26,549
[SPEAKER_04]: He did mention that episode one did get a million downloads across all the platforms, so it didn't do that bad.

1235
01:27:27,955 --> 01:27:41,302
[SPEAKER_04]: A game that should have done a hell of a lot better than it did was Rock Band 3 and a company is taking a second chance on the game because, you know, I guess MTV Games isn't really around anymore so you can't really get new Rock Band 3.

1236
01:27:42,062 --> 01:27:49,726
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Mad Catz is going to be basically re-releasing Rock Band 3 this holiday with their peripherals.

1237
01:27:49,906 --> 01:27:54,988
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a really weird type of thing to see a company come in and pick up a game for a re-release like that.

1238
01:27:55,108 --> 01:27:56,569
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but they did the official peripherals.

1239
01:27:56,849 --> 01:27:58,550
[SPEAKER_04]: Guitar Controller Version and Drum Kit Version

1240
01:28:14,179 --> 01:28:14,479
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura

1241
01:28:37,270 --> 01:28:45,433
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, for fans of SingStar, there is a new version to be coming out calling SingStar Back to the 80s and it'll be out sometime before Christmas.

1242
01:28:46,033 --> 01:28:48,034
[SPEAKER_02]: Has 30 massive hits.

1243
01:28:48,114 --> 01:28:48,994
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I gotta ask.

1244
01:28:49,714 --> 01:28:51,935
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it gonna have the song Back to the 80s?

1245
01:28:53,696 --> 01:28:54,456
[SPEAKER_04]: Like by Aqua?

1246
01:28:54,616 --> 01:28:54,956
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1247
01:28:55,256 --> 01:28:55,717
[SPEAKER_04]: I doubt it.

1248
01:28:55,737 --> 01:28:56,777
[SPEAKER_04]: That wasn't an 80s song.

1249
01:28:56,817 --> 01:28:59,098
[SPEAKER_04]: But it'd be cool though.

1250
01:28:59,118 --> 01:29:01,219
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's gonna have Whitesnake and Devo.

1251
01:29:01,539 --> 01:29:03,319
[SPEAKER_04]: It might be for sale on the SingStore.

1252
01:29:04,200 --> 01:29:04,940
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe Meatloaf.

1253
01:29:06,437 --> 01:29:09,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for the members Thanks for the members

1254
01:29:23,058 --> 01:29:24,700
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1255
01:29:44,797 --> 01:29:55,044
[SPEAKER_02]: And moving forward, we have for North America on September 9th, the Flame Red 3DS will be out.

1256
01:29:55,244 --> 01:29:55,845
[SPEAKER_04]: It's flaming.

1257
01:29:56,545 --> 01:29:57,025
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it is.

1258
01:29:57,305 --> 01:30:03,029
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I like... There was a DS in that exact same color, wasn't there?

1259
01:30:05,351 --> 01:30:07,272
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the name in Japan, though.

1260
01:30:07,292 --> 01:30:08,033
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Flare Red.

1261
01:30:08,793 --> 01:30:09,714
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's kind of cool.

1262
01:30:10,394 --> 01:30:12,295
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, it's a 3DS and it's red and black.

1263
01:30:12,916 --> 01:30:13,236
[SPEAKER_02]: The end.

1264
01:30:14,725 --> 01:30:15,025
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1265
01:30:16,566 --> 01:30:24,749
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, guys, before we get back to some more long-form news, I do want to give one more shout-out for the indie game Spotlight that we're going to be doing on the show.

1266
01:30:25,109 --> 01:30:27,350
[SPEAKER_04]: Haven't had a whole lot of bites on that, so I don't know.

1267
01:30:27,370 --> 01:30:29,590
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess we must not have a lot of developers listen to the show.

1268
01:30:29,630 --> 01:30:35,813
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, if you or a friend are developing an independently produced game, either for iOS, PC...

1269
01:30:37,933 --> 01:31:05,143
[SPEAKER_04]: Xbox Live Arcade or you know pretty much anything we'll take a look at it and maybe invite you on the show to talk about it and hopefully get you noticed because right now one of the biggest bitches we're hearing about that is it's really hard to get noticed on Xbox Live Arcade because A. Microsoft doesn't really highlight a lot of the indie stuff and B. a lot of it is crap there's a lot of crap out there but there are a few good things and if you believe you have a diamond in the rough we want to call it out here on this program

1270
01:31:05,703 --> 01:31:20,324
[SPEAKER_04]: so coming soon to the program and if we don't get a lot of developers to bite on that we'll just kind of start spotlighting stuff we like and that's where we'll go with it because we're committed to helping indie games get more acknowledgement because after all we're an indie podcast and we know it can be tough

1271
01:31:21,305 --> 01:31:22,646
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, I want to give a plug.

1272
01:31:22,666 --> 01:31:29,351
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of any podcast to another show that we do here at OLR Network, it is Horde House.

1273
01:31:29,491 --> 01:31:30,752
[SPEAKER_04]: The best little Horde House in Azeroth.

1274
01:31:31,312 --> 01:31:39,057
[SPEAKER_04]: www.hordehouse.com If you like World of Warcraft, there's all sorts of fun stuff about WoW on that program.

1275
01:31:39,097 --> 01:31:40,838
[SPEAKER_04]: This week especially was a really fun show.

1276
01:31:41,499 --> 01:31:43,320
[SPEAKER_04]: We taped on an off day this week.

1277
01:31:43,460 --> 01:31:46,302
[SPEAKER_04]: We had a guy from Britain on the show and it was fun.

1278
01:31:46,382 --> 01:31:48,403
[SPEAKER_04]: Rice Princess crashed the show about halfway through.

1279
01:31:48,423 --> 01:31:49,864
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess she's not Rice Princess anymore.

1280
01:31:49,904 --> 01:31:50,605
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm supposed to call her Irene.

1281
01:31:51,025 --> 01:31:52,166
[SPEAKER_04]: She'll always be Rice Princess to me.

1282
01:31:52,646 --> 01:31:57,489
[SPEAKER_04]: She crashed the show about halfway through, and we were talking about PvP for a little while, so it was cool.

1283
01:31:57,709 --> 01:31:58,069
[SPEAKER_04]: Good show.

1284
01:31:58,529 --> 01:31:59,069
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's check it out.

1285
01:31:59,310 --> 01:32:00,230
[SPEAKER_02]: Is she having withdrawals?

1286
01:32:01,631 --> 01:32:08,014
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't sound like it, but it was still nice to have her perspective, even though she's pretty comfortable in her decision to quit.

1287
01:32:08,054 --> 01:32:15,198
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think, you know what's funny is that most people that were on the show this week are on a bit of hiatus, but all of them were like, yeah, I'll come back eventually.

1288
01:32:15,578 --> 01:32:18,520
[SPEAKER_04]: And even Picaruno, who is our guest over from overseas, is like,

1289
01:32:18,780 --> 01:32:19,100
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

1290
01:32:46,533 --> 01:32:46,993
[SPEAKER_02]: Girls Gone Wow.

1291
01:33:11,525 --> 01:33:30,641
[SPEAKER_02]: But they are lovely people and they thank you for the biscuits Awesome Yes, it's .net, girlsgonewild.net So check them out, I was on episode 25 and Rob will be on episode 26 Hooray Alright, lots of Warcraft stuff We also had a little bit of Doctor Who discussion We do more than Warcraft, I promise Oh really?

1292
01:33:30,961 --> 01:33:39,228
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah Fun It came up a little bit Fun Alright, the new show has nothing to do with Warcraft It is very much not about Warcraft, I'll say that much

1293
01:33:39,908 --> 01:33:41,789
[SPEAKER_02]: If Dan's involved, it's not about Warcraft.

1294
01:33:41,809 --> 01:33:42,210
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

1295
01:33:42,530 --> 01:33:47,653
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's get back into some more long-form news, and Loki's going to start us off.

1296
01:33:48,173 --> 01:33:48,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I am.

1297
01:33:49,154 --> 01:33:51,115
[SPEAKER_06]: Why don't I take a break here from this game?

1298
01:33:51,255 --> 01:33:52,316
[SPEAKER_06]: You and that VVVVV.

1299
01:33:52,656 --> 01:33:53,396
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, I'm getting pretty far.

1300
01:33:54,857 --> 01:34:00,240
[SPEAKER_06]: So Google Plus has started doing some games, and this is not a big surprise.

1301
01:34:00,260 --> 01:34:01,361
[SPEAKER_06]: We kind of knew this was going to happen.

1302
01:34:02,081 --> 01:34:05,864
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, their rollout is a little bit like what we thought.

1303
01:34:06,224 --> 01:34:14,930
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to have a separate game section so you can play your games and all the updates for those games are on one section.

1304
01:34:15,390 --> 01:34:17,952
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't clutter up your feed or whatever.

1305
01:34:18,772 --> 01:34:26,338
[SPEAKER_06]: So of course, they're going to start off with Angry Birds, Dragon Age Legends, Sudoku, stuff of that sort.

1306
01:34:27,218 --> 01:34:28,639
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can check it out.

1307
01:34:28,679 --> 01:34:31,461
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to be starting to roll out some more stuff.

1308
01:34:32,142 --> 01:34:35,086
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, in the great Google tradition, not everybody had it right away.

1309
01:34:35,566 --> 01:34:37,950
[SPEAKER_04]: I got mine the day after this was announced, though.

1310
01:34:39,071 --> 01:34:41,114
[SPEAKER_04]: I play Bejeweled Blitz on Google Games.

1311
01:34:41,134 --> 01:34:44,478
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess I forgot to say that at the top of the show, but I play Bejeweled Blitz on Google Games.

1312
01:34:44,979 --> 01:34:49,365
[SPEAKER_04]: And I gotta say, I love that the game stuff is just on a separate frickin' page.

1313
01:34:49,645 --> 01:35:04,112
[SPEAKER_06]: And it sounds like that they're trying to be a little bit more of kind of a destination for these developers because they're offering, you know, the commissions that they're taking from these games are a lot less than, say, Facebook.

1314
01:35:04,412 --> 01:35:10,475
[SPEAKER_06]: For example, VentureBee is reporting that Google is only taking a 5% commission on its games, whereas Facebook takes 30.

1315
01:35:11,496 --> 01:35:15,938
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I mean, that might be a little bit more beneficial for some of these developers out there.

1316
01:35:16,058 --> 01:35:16,498
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what, though?

1317
01:35:16,578 --> 01:35:21,141
[SPEAKER_04]: I honestly think it's going to get harder to be noticed on Google Games because they don't clutter your feed.

1318
01:35:21,201 --> 01:35:26,644
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I honestly think part of the reason why Farmville was so successful was that it did spam the shit out of everybody.

1319
01:35:27,004 --> 01:35:29,046
[SPEAKER_04]: And people who didn't know better, i.e.

1320
01:35:29,106 --> 01:35:33,148
[SPEAKER_04]: soccer moms, started playing it because they saw, oh, Ethel's playing this game.

1321
01:35:33,228 --> 01:35:34,129
[SPEAKER_04]: I should play it, too.

1322
01:35:34,769 --> 01:35:38,751
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, I think that's a lot of how those games became so successful.

1323
01:35:38,992 --> 01:35:42,594
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's going to be interesting to see if the Google Games model is successful because, honestly...

1324
01:35:43,214 --> 01:35:51,685
[SPEAKER_04]: How is going to a different page to see your game content any better than, I don't know, MSN Zone is a Microsoft site where you can play games.

1325
01:35:51,785 --> 01:35:53,727
[SPEAKER_04]: But I bet a lot of people don't really play there.

1326
01:35:53,968 --> 01:35:59,975
[SPEAKER_06]: Going to a different page, how different is that going to a different website to play your games?

1327
01:36:00,095 --> 01:36:00,556
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

1328
01:36:00,716 --> 01:36:01,197
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, I know.

1329
01:36:01,557 --> 01:36:04,439
[SPEAKER_04]: But I will say this to Google's credit, it's clean.

1330
01:36:04,939 --> 01:36:07,601
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I feel like when I go to Zone MSN, it's very cluttered.

1331
01:36:07,641 --> 01:36:09,622
[SPEAKER_04]: There's ads everywhere, blah, blah, blah, you know?

1332
01:36:10,123 --> 01:36:12,804
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a cluttered website full of clutter.

1333
01:36:13,245 --> 01:36:15,646
[SPEAKER_04]: But Google Games, I thought, is pretty slick.

1334
01:36:15,706 --> 01:36:16,047
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know...

1335
01:36:16,987 --> 01:36:20,789
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the things people either love or they hate about Google Plus is that it's very plain.

1336
01:36:21,390 --> 01:36:24,191
[SPEAKER_04]: There's not a lot of flair to it right now.

1337
01:36:24,231 --> 01:36:25,732
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a very plain looking site.

1338
01:36:26,072 --> 01:36:28,394
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't really have ads at all right now.

1339
01:36:28,874 --> 01:36:30,255
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how long that's going to last.

1340
01:36:31,135 --> 01:36:34,677
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a very clean site and the games site kind of carries that on.

1341
01:36:36,158 --> 01:36:41,023
[SPEAKER_04]: I did notice that Bejeweled Blitz was kind of skinned for Google Games.

1342
01:36:41,103 --> 01:36:43,505
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it looks like it was very specific towards that.

1343
01:36:43,585 --> 01:36:46,268
[SPEAKER_04]: So I didn't play anything else.

1344
01:36:46,288 --> 01:36:48,710
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the only one I played, but I'm down with it.

1345
01:36:48,950 --> 01:36:52,474
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to check out more Google Games if they get some more stuff I want to play.

1346
01:36:52,514 --> 01:36:55,156
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I don't know, Civ World could come out.

1347
01:36:55,176 --> 01:36:55,737
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be great.

1348
01:36:56,357 --> 01:36:56,998
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd be into that.

1349
01:36:57,879 --> 01:36:58,199
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

1350
01:37:00,040 --> 01:37:02,921
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, go into our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

1351
01:37:04,521 --> 01:37:08,082
[SPEAKER_04]: Blakeman is talking about Dragon Age and all that.

1352
01:37:08,222 --> 01:37:12,824
[SPEAKER_04]: It should be illegal to use games like Dragon Age in the same sentence as Angry Birds.

1353
01:37:13,524 --> 01:37:16,665
[SPEAKER_04]: Believe it or not, Dragon Age Legends is one of the launch games.

1354
01:37:17,085 --> 01:37:17,985
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never played that.

1355
01:37:18,085 --> 01:37:20,746
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that like Knights of the Clicky or what?

1356
01:37:21,320 --> 01:37:21,660
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1357
01:37:21,760 --> 01:37:22,861
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think it's like that.

1358
01:37:22,881 --> 01:37:28,884
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's more of like a simplified version, kind of like a Diablo-esque type thing.

1359
01:37:28,944 --> 01:37:30,124
[SPEAKER_04]: That might actually be kind of fun.

1360
01:37:30,244 --> 01:37:31,005
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll have to check that out.

1361
01:37:32,045 --> 01:37:32,445
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

1362
01:37:32,545 --> 01:37:35,947
[SPEAKER_04]: Zether says, Bejeweled Blitz is good, but it only gives you one minute to play.

1363
01:37:36,047 --> 01:37:37,167
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's kind of the point.

1364
01:37:37,247 --> 01:37:39,889
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the little bite-sized version of Bejeweled there.

1365
01:37:39,909 --> 01:37:40,509
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of like it.

1366
01:37:41,489 --> 01:37:41,870
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you go.

1367
01:37:46,313 --> 01:37:47,534
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on to other stuff.

1368
01:37:47,874 --> 01:37:49,276
[SPEAKER_04]: This is another Nintendo story.

1369
01:37:49,657 --> 01:37:50,618
[SPEAKER_04]: This is very interesting.

1370
01:37:51,479 --> 01:37:52,420
[SPEAKER_04]: Very interesting patent.

1371
01:37:53,902 --> 01:37:54,782
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

1372
01:38:17,630 --> 01:38:18,831
[SPEAKER_04]: GameSpot found the filing.

1373
01:38:18,971 --> 01:38:26,999
[SPEAKER_04]: The MSO, I guess, would be an environment where your actions and choices affect the world that they and everyone else live in.

1374
01:38:27,680 --> 01:38:29,481
[SPEAKER_04]: So, for example, an economic system.

1375
01:38:30,202 --> 01:38:34,346
[SPEAKER_04]: Or maybe a case where a player finds building materials and they make a house.

1376
01:38:34,726 --> 01:38:37,669
[SPEAKER_04]: Then all the other players are going to see the house, just not the owner.

1377
01:38:37,849 --> 01:38:40,172
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm imagining they're not going to see the material either.

1378
01:38:41,153 --> 01:38:48,660
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess there's an idea too where players would gossip to an AI non-player character who spreads it to other characters in the world.

1379
01:38:49,001 --> 01:38:55,908
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course that instantly made my brain go, oh, it's Animal Crossing, which I'm sure a lot of people are thinking at this point.

1380
01:38:55,968 --> 01:39:02,815
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, and not to say this is the first game that's been kind of single player, but yet had sort of the multiplayer tie like Demon's Souls.

1381
01:39:03,035 --> 01:39:03,475
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's fine.

1382
01:39:03,515 --> 01:39:05,556
[SPEAKER_04]: Bobby was talking about this on his show right before that.

1383
01:39:05,576 --> 01:39:09,577
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, I don't see why Nintendo – I guess I should properly plug his show.

1384
01:39:09,617 --> 01:39:13,338
[SPEAKER_04]: He's always before us here at All Games Radio, but he's on at 5 Pacific.

1385
01:39:13,378 --> 01:39:17,959
[SPEAKER_04]: BobbyBlackWolf at BobbyBlackWolf.com was talking about this subject tonight a little more in depth on his show.

1386
01:39:18,279 --> 01:39:21,660
[SPEAKER_04]: And he said, I can think of two right off the top of my head that already do this.

1387
01:39:21,680 --> 01:39:24,301
[SPEAKER_04]: And he said Demon's Souls, and the other one was –

1388
01:39:26,673 --> 01:39:27,553
[SPEAKER_04]: I fucking forgot.

1389
01:39:27,693 --> 01:39:30,375
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a PC game.

1390
01:39:30,995 --> 01:39:33,316
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's going to come to me as soon as somebody yells it out in chat.

1391
01:39:33,696 --> 01:39:35,537
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't remember what the other one was, but there's another game.

1392
01:39:35,577 --> 01:39:36,657
[SPEAKER_02]: Random game on the PC.

1393
01:39:37,898 --> 01:39:39,018
[SPEAKER_04]: That was exactly like it.

1394
01:39:39,278 --> 01:39:47,742
[SPEAKER_04]: I think he was saying, he was trying to say Diablo 3 was kind of part of this too, where Diablo 3 has a single player mode, but yet it's going to have this auction house that's more massive.

1395
01:39:48,442 --> 01:39:53,565
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's interesting that Nintendo would be getting a patent on this when it's kind of already been done.

1396
01:39:53,725 --> 01:39:55,686
[SPEAKER_04]: And can they really do that, IDK?

1397
01:39:57,086 --> 01:39:58,687
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, especially if the patent was in 2010.

1398
01:39:58,727 --> 01:39:59,487
[SPEAKER_06]: Demon's Souls came out in 2010.

1399
01:40:03,444 --> 01:40:04,284
[SPEAKER_04]: Fable Spore

1400
01:40:24,091 --> 01:40:34,197
[SPEAKER_04]: But yes, Spore was very much, remember, you would make your little monster and then it kind of went off into the Spore universe and the universe was made up of other creatures that other people had made.

1401
01:40:34,217 --> 01:40:35,838
[SPEAKER_04]: But you never play the game with these people.

1402
01:40:36,198 --> 01:40:37,819
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just that the players made the environment.

1403
01:40:38,159 --> 01:40:41,501
[SPEAKER_04]: And that game was out in 08, I think.

1404
01:40:42,182 --> 01:40:50,467
[SPEAKER_06]: And to a lesser extent, you could even say that the Wii with people's Miis because you share the Miis and they pop up in games sometimes.

1405
01:40:50,767 --> 01:40:50,967
[SPEAKER_07]: Mm-hmm.

1406
01:40:54,741 --> 01:40:56,643
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, let's see.

1407
01:40:57,203 --> 01:40:58,585
[SPEAKER_04]: What else do I want to say about this patent?

1408
01:40:59,106 --> 01:41:04,652
[SPEAKER_04]: More, the filing talks about how the game has to be suitable for play on something called the Wii 3D.

1409
01:41:06,735 --> 01:41:11,979
[SPEAKER_04]: This was filed, of course, in 2010, so maybe at one point the Wii U was going to be the Wii 3D.

1410
01:41:12,600 --> 01:41:15,042
[SPEAKER_04]: Or the 3DS was the Wii 3D at one point.

1411
01:41:15,362 --> 01:41:17,343
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows, but don't read too far into that.

1412
01:41:17,444 --> 01:41:19,966
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure this does not mean Wii 3D confirmed.

1413
01:41:20,486 --> 01:41:26,651
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure that Nintendo explores a lot of options about what they're going to do and files patents to cover their butt.

1414
01:41:27,452 --> 01:41:27,532
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

1415
01:41:29,013 --> 01:41:37,220
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just interesting that Nintendo would go for something like this when, yeah, I think we have examples of other games that already kind of have done this.

1416
01:41:37,300 --> 01:41:40,823
[SPEAKER_04]: So it would be a little bit crappy if Nintendo gets it.

1417
01:41:41,163 --> 01:41:44,226
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, only if Nintendo decides to go after these other developers.

1418
01:41:44,847 --> 01:41:48,630
[SPEAKER_04]: But then again, if I were the company that made Demon's Souls from software, right?

1419
01:41:49,471 --> 01:41:51,512
[SPEAKER_04]: I would be all like, F you, Nintendo.

1420
01:41:51,572 --> 01:41:51,833
[SPEAKER_04]: We have...

1421
01:41:52,713 --> 01:41:55,254
[SPEAKER_04]: This game was out a long time ago.

1422
01:41:55,294 --> 01:41:58,455
[SPEAKER_06]: But just because they do that, though, can they still patent it?

1423
01:41:58,835 --> 01:42:01,916
[SPEAKER_06]: Like if I come up with something but I don't patent it, then they do?

1424
01:42:02,296 --> 01:42:05,977
[SPEAKER_04]: The whole patent system in this country is fucked up anyway.

1425
01:42:06,017 --> 01:42:08,857
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, I'm going to defer to Bobby's show because he puts it better than I do.

1426
01:42:09,297 --> 01:42:11,238
[SPEAKER_04]: But just talking about how...

1427
01:42:11,798 --> 01:42:15,399
[SPEAKER_04]: It's ridiculous that you can patent all these software concepts.

1428
01:42:15,519 --> 01:42:19,881
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you want to see the headache it's causing, just look at all this bullshit with LoadSys.

1429
01:42:20,001 --> 01:42:22,882
[SPEAKER_04]: LoadSys is specifically a patent troll company.

1430
01:42:23,102 --> 01:42:24,163
[SPEAKER_04]: There is no office.

1431
01:42:24,503 --> 01:42:28,464
[SPEAKER_04]: There's nothing to LoadSys besides some troll.

1432
01:42:28,704 --> 01:42:32,626
[SPEAKER_04]: Literally a troll sitting under the bridge begging for money.

1433
01:42:33,406 --> 01:42:36,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Or demanding money, in this case, with their stock of patents.

1434
01:42:36,907 --> 01:42:59,307
[SPEAKER_04]: and that's kind of screwed up you know something needs to be done patenting hardware that's a little different I get that but a lot of this software patent and the other example I know that Bobby always brings up again just to totally bite his show is the one click thing from Amazon it's ridiculous that Amazon has a patent on one click that whole one click to buy one click to purchase nobody else can do that Amazon has the patent on it that's ridiculous

1435
01:43:00,948 --> 01:43:05,610
[SPEAKER_04]: In my opinion, you're patenting something that's kind of like a key functionality of the internet, a link.

1436
01:43:06,150 --> 01:43:10,773
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm patenting the Q key.

1437
01:43:11,333 --> 01:43:11,813
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

1438
01:43:12,013 --> 01:43:15,235
[SPEAKER_06]: I patent device to create queue by pressing button.

1439
01:43:17,648 --> 01:43:19,670
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, it's interesting to see what comes out.

1440
01:43:19,710 --> 01:43:20,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, it's just a patent.

1441
01:43:21,032 --> 01:43:23,395
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't mean New Animal Crossing confirmed.

1442
01:43:23,515 --> 01:43:25,937
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, those Animal Crossing games do sell.

1443
01:43:26,198 --> 01:43:28,440
[SPEAKER_06]: New Animal Crossing confirmed, really?

1444
01:43:28,600 --> 01:43:30,122
[SPEAKER_04]: They do sell pretty well, right?

1445
01:43:30,142 --> 01:43:31,704
[SPEAKER_04]: Another system, another Animal Crossing.

1446
01:43:31,724 --> 01:43:34,006
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you're going to see another Animal Crossing regardless.

1447
01:43:34,647 --> 01:43:34,727
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

1448
01:43:35,908 --> 01:43:36,949
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be something.

1449
01:43:37,009 --> 01:43:45,314
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we are assuming it's Animal Crossing, but to not assume it's Animal Crossing would be to then assume that Nintendo is doing something different.

1450
01:43:46,154 --> 01:43:48,555
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to take the safer bet and say it's Animal Crossing.

1451
01:43:48,575 --> 01:43:50,156
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know about you guys.

1452
01:43:50,677 --> 01:43:51,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo, different.

1453
01:43:52,638 --> 01:43:55,219
[SPEAKER_02]: They just put different in the same packaging.

1454
01:43:55,920 --> 01:43:58,781
[SPEAKER_04]: Blakeman in our chatroom says, you can be a professional troll.

1455
01:43:59,261 --> 01:44:01,683
[SPEAKER_04]: Why was I not informed and where do I get an application?

1456
01:44:03,976 --> 01:44:06,577
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, but Troll's more qualified than you have already applied.

1457
01:44:07,977 --> 01:44:10,718
[SPEAKER_02]: Those doing the interviews were thoroughly insulted, therefore they were hired.

1458
01:44:12,098 --> 01:44:14,098
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, anyhow, let's move on with some more news.

1459
01:44:14,879 --> 01:44:15,719
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, no, the mailbag.

1460
01:44:15,999 --> 01:44:16,739
[SPEAKER_04]: Mailbag's up now.

1461
01:44:17,239 --> 01:44:17,899
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get to it.

1462
01:44:18,279 --> 01:44:24,421
[SPEAKER_04]: Every week here on Orange Lounge Radio, DarkSakura likes to open up the mail, dive in headfirst, and pull out some emails to read for you.

1463
01:44:24,441 --> 01:44:24,941
[SPEAKER_04]: I like to.

1464
01:44:25,741 --> 01:44:26,401
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to.

1465
01:44:28,122 --> 01:44:29,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the music's playing.

1466
01:44:29,602 --> 01:44:30,322
[SPEAKER_04]: So therefore you must.

1467
01:44:30,382 --> 01:44:34,084
[SPEAKER_04]: Mailbag at orangelaundreater.com if you want to email us sometime.

1468
01:44:35,065 --> 01:44:35,685
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get to it.

1469
01:44:36,106 --> 01:44:40,788
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm also going to again say that if you send multiple emails, I'm only going to read one of them.

1470
01:44:41,388 --> 01:44:42,389
[SPEAKER_02]: So do not take offense.

1471
01:44:43,089 --> 01:44:48,192
[SPEAKER_04]: That being said, the first... And if you send one email that's like 500 pages, she might trim it down too.

1472
01:44:48,972 --> 01:44:49,653
[SPEAKER_02]: Or just not read it.

1473
01:44:50,133 --> 01:44:51,414
[SPEAKER_02]: Or just put it on the forum or something.

1474
01:44:52,114 --> 01:44:52,875
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, OLR.

1475
01:44:53,835 --> 01:44:56,557
[SPEAKER_02]: You've been talking about Capcom a lot lately, and it reminded me of something.

1476
01:44:56,917 --> 01:45:00,620
[SPEAKER_02]: Back in 08 when I visited Japan, I made it a point to hunt down the Capcom building.

1477
01:45:01,080 --> 01:45:08,185
[SPEAKER_02]: Though I couldn't read the website, I used Google to loosely translate the addresses on it until I found a likely one and had a cab take me to the building.

1478
01:45:09,246 --> 01:45:10,566
[SPEAKER_02]: The guard there was pretty surprised.

1479
01:45:10,626 --> 01:45:15,810
[SPEAKER_02]: My husband and I were looking around for maybe a store or something, but it was just a building with a big old Capcom logo on the side.

1480
01:45:16,190 --> 01:45:21,534
[SPEAKER_02]: The guard asked us if we need help, and we told him we were tourists and wanted to see the Capcom building and if it had a gift shop or anything.

1481
01:45:22,474 --> 01:45:26,415
[SPEAKER_02]: Well this card goes inside and brings back the public relations manager for Capcom Japan.

1482
01:45:26,956 --> 01:45:31,717
[SPEAKER_02]: We thought it was so cool she kept apologizing that we'd gone out of our way to see the building and there wasn't a store or anything.

1483
01:45:32,157 --> 01:45:34,198
[SPEAKER_02]: We told her it was still great and we love Okami.

1484
01:45:34,618 --> 01:45:39,420
[SPEAKER_02]: She gave us folders about investing in Capcom and her business card so I thought I'd send it along to you here.

1485
01:45:40,160 --> 01:45:41,520
[SPEAKER_02]: Just something cool you might like.

1486
01:45:41,640 --> 01:45:43,481
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure if she still works there now.

1487
01:45:44,221 --> 01:45:46,403
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a link to the pic on my DeviantArt page.

1488
01:45:46,463 --> 01:45:47,644
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry about the watermark.

1489
01:45:47,684 --> 01:45:48,645
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes that gets fixed.

1490
01:45:48,685 --> 01:45:50,827
[SPEAKER_02]: I swear DeviantArt randomly turns it on sometimes.

1491
01:45:51,247 --> 01:45:53,389
[SPEAKER_04]: That's from Holly D. Oh my god, I love it.

1492
01:45:53,469 --> 01:45:55,851
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's a pamphlet on investing in Capcom.

1493
01:45:58,113 --> 01:45:58,894
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, again.

1494
01:45:59,214 --> 01:46:00,155
[SPEAKER_04]: There's the picture of the building.

1495
01:46:00,396 --> 01:46:02,357
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to come look at this over here over your shoulder.

1496
01:46:02,417 --> 01:46:04,599
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess we can't Tumblr these because these are private pictures.

1497
01:46:04,799 --> 01:46:06,441
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on DeviantArt.

1498
01:46:06,781 --> 01:46:07,081
[SPEAKER_04]: Chihotamoto

1499
01:46:33,925 --> 01:46:34,445
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cute.

1500
01:46:35,005 --> 01:46:36,146
[SPEAKER_04]: What's on the other page?

1501
01:46:36,746 --> 01:46:37,606
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a second page there?

1502
01:46:37,706 --> 01:46:38,306
[SPEAKER_02]: There's another.

1503
01:46:38,486 --> 01:46:39,166
[SPEAKER_02]: There's an image.

1504
01:46:39,987 --> 01:46:40,087
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh.

1505
01:46:41,447 --> 01:46:42,947
[SPEAKER_02]: That's her signature.

1506
01:46:43,287 --> 01:46:45,668
[SPEAKER_04]: That's still kind of cool.

1507
01:46:45,988 --> 01:46:46,228
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1508
01:46:46,788 --> 01:46:48,909
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me see if there's anything else, though, included in this.

1509
01:46:49,749 --> 01:46:53,710
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope, just the... I love that whole, here's some information if you want to invest in the company.

1510
01:46:54,030 --> 01:46:59,172
[SPEAKER_04]: Which, you know, again, if you want to really get your point across, you should invest in a company.

1511
01:46:59,212 --> 01:47:00,472
[SPEAKER_04]: You should invest in Capcom.

1512
01:47:01,485 --> 01:47:01,966
[SPEAKER_04]: I bought a hoe

1513
01:47:15,382 --> 01:47:17,223
[SPEAKER_02]: We bought it on the corner outside your building.

1514
01:47:17,243 --> 01:47:18,244
[SPEAKER_02]: What'd you call me, Earl?

1515
01:47:20,646 --> 01:47:30,353
[SPEAKER_02]: Dear Personages, After returning from my Vegas trip, during which I had a truly fun time, I gave myself an extra day to run errands and unwind just a little bit more.

1516
01:47:31,113 --> 01:47:40,640
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things I did was I called up my local Walmart, called up the Walmart that is also on the same road but slightly farther away from me, and found myself a $170 3DS.

1517
01:47:41,200 --> 01:47:44,723
[SPEAKER_02]: I also got a game because a gaming system without a game is just an expensive paperweight.

1518
01:47:45,063 --> 01:48:07,346
[SPEAKER_02]: much like my Sega Game Gear is now I've got Guardian Heroes on Game Gear and you probably don't anyway I'm not emailing you to gloat or be a braggart about my purchase I'm being a braggart but I just wanted to ask a question of you are any of you three aware of any pornographic websites that can be viewed on the Nintendo 3DS

1519
01:48:08,647 --> 01:48:09,348
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1520
01:48:38,209 --> 01:48:39,529
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me Google that for you.

1521
01:48:40,389 --> 01:48:44,290
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura is going to search right now for... Nintendo 3DS boobs.

1522
01:48:45,951 --> 01:48:48,371
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't you just Google 3D porn?

1523
01:48:50,111 --> 01:48:51,232
[SPEAKER_04]: 3D website porn.

1524
01:48:53,572 --> 01:48:54,232
[SPEAKER_02]: 3DS porn.

1525
01:48:54,692 --> 01:49:01,234
[SPEAKER_06]: There is actually a pack you can get that someone made that's a bunch of 3D pictures that you can upload to your device.

1526
01:49:01,254 --> 01:49:02,434
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not pornographic, though.

1527
01:49:02,454 --> 01:49:03,014
[SPEAKER_06]: They're just like,

1528
01:49:03,857 --> 01:49:06,898
[SPEAKER_04]: Like sexy swimsuits and things like that?

1529
01:49:06,919 --> 01:49:07,319
[SPEAKER_06]: Like lingerie.

1530
01:49:07,439 --> 01:49:10,240
[SPEAKER_06]: It's some idol.

1531
01:49:11,941 --> 01:49:15,863
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, then I'll leave it to the chat room to try and fill us in on some 3D porno.

1532
01:49:16,670 --> 01:49:17,931
[SPEAKER_06]: But hey, you know what though?

1533
01:49:19,211 --> 01:49:21,053
[SPEAKER_06]: There's people out there, they have 3D cameras.

1534
01:49:21,213 --> 01:49:24,054
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure people have taken 3D pornographic videos.

1535
01:49:24,114 --> 01:49:28,457
[SPEAKER_04]: You know that, look, here's, look, let me just break it down.

1536
01:49:28,757 --> 01:49:29,758
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just going to break it down.

1537
01:49:30,738 --> 01:49:33,720
[SPEAKER_04]: Every 3DS has a 3D camera in it.

1538
01:49:34,941 --> 01:49:40,244
[SPEAKER_04]: Pictures of boobs and penises were taken within seconds of the 3DS launch.

1539
01:49:40,844 --> 01:49:42,565
[SPEAKER_04]: So those pictures are out there somewhere.

1540
01:49:42,665 --> 01:49:45,627
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a matter of having a place to share those pictures.

1541
01:49:46,994 --> 01:49:47,635
[SPEAKER_04]: Next email from Chiggers

1542
01:50:12,970 --> 01:50:17,034
[SPEAKER_02]: Has anyone tried the demo for the indie game No Luca No on Xbox?

1543
01:50:17,574 --> 01:50:20,677
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole demo is you sweating Luca the cat away from your cereal.

1544
01:50:21,858 --> 01:50:24,760
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if the whole game is like that, but I giggled like a schoolgirl.

1545
01:50:24,800 --> 01:50:25,261
[SPEAKER_02]: Tee hee.

1546
01:50:26,001 --> 01:50:27,963
[SPEAKER_02]: Give DarkSakura tacos because she deserves it.

1547
01:50:28,103 --> 01:50:28,403
[SPEAKER_02]: P.S.

1548
01:50:28,463 --> 01:50:30,125
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't seen you guys on Drenden in a while.

1549
01:50:30,205 --> 01:50:30,966
[SPEAKER_02]: We're ArtVal.

1550
01:50:31,146 --> 01:50:31,727
[SPEAKER_02]: I miss you.

1551
01:50:32,468 --> 01:50:36,372
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm only able to check in like once a week because I'm really busy with raiding now all of a sudden.

1552
01:50:36,432 --> 01:50:37,313
[SPEAKER_04]: We are actually doing that.

1553
01:50:37,613 --> 01:50:40,156
[SPEAKER_04]: But I will check in on the Drenden Guild very soon.

1554
01:50:40,176 --> 01:50:41,277
[SPEAKER_04]: I do at least once a week.

1555
01:50:41,437 --> 01:50:41,938
[SPEAKER_02]: I have an idea.

1556
01:50:42,158 --> 01:50:42,338
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1557
01:50:42,719 --> 01:50:44,200
[SPEAKER_02]: Tuesday, let's have a Drenden-a-thon.

1558
01:50:44,801 --> 01:50:47,124
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to check the personal calendar, but maybe.

1559
01:50:48,265 --> 01:50:48,545
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.

1560
01:50:48,725 --> 01:50:49,466
[SPEAKER_04]: Drenden-a-thon.

1561
01:50:49,526 --> 01:50:50,147
[SPEAKER_04]: Drenden-a-thon.

1562
01:50:50,868 --> 01:50:58,901
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise, as far as the whole Luca the Cat or whatever that game was called, no, I've never played that game, but I'm going to as soon as I... Oh, I fucking can't.

1563
01:50:58,961 --> 01:51:01,265
[SPEAKER_04]: I will in 21 days when the investigation is complete.

1564
01:51:01,786 --> 01:51:02,647
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, Microsoft.

1565
01:51:03,502 --> 01:51:06,783
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually looking up NoLucaNo, and there's a video on here.

1566
01:51:06,823 --> 01:51:09,564
[SPEAKER_02]: It says worst Xbox Live game ever on YouTube.

1567
01:51:11,084 --> 01:51:14,185
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I'm going to have to just send you the link to this, Rob, so that you can pull it up.

1568
01:51:14,546 --> 01:51:16,766
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, BlackWolf is on it right now.

1569
01:51:16,846 --> 01:51:22,488
[SPEAKER_04]: He makes websites, so I'm assuming that BlackWolf is currently in the process of making 3DS boobs right now.

1570
01:51:22,568 --> 01:51:24,769
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll just wait on that.

1571
01:51:28,979 --> 01:51:29,720
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi Rob, Jamie, and Loki.

1572
01:51:29,740 --> 01:51:32,702
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to say keep up the amazing work and dedication to your fans.

1573
01:51:32,742 --> 01:51:35,784
[SPEAKER_04]: And by the way, Jamie, I wanted to inform you about a website.

1574
01:51:35,864 --> 01:51:39,828
[SPEAKER_02]: Please use... The website is Abandonia.com A-B-A-N-D-O-N-I-A.com

1575
01:51:55,780 --> 01:52:02,766
[SPEAKER_02]: The website hosts abandonware and such, although I would verify its legality because I honestly didn't pay much attention to it.

1576
01:52:02,846 --> 01:52:03,246
[SPEAKER_02]: LOL.

1577
01:52:03,807 --> 01:52:09,732
[SPEAKER_02]: I was looking for a copy of SimTower for my PC and found it on this floating site, so.

1578
01:52:10,432 --> 01:52:16,177
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I know it's technically ultra lame to plug a podcast that is unrelated to said current podcast on said podcast.

1579
01:52:16,357 --> 01:52:16,697
[SPEAKER_02]: LOL.

1580
01:52:17,258 --> 01:52:19,139
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would appreciate it if you would plug my podcast.

1581
01:52:19,219 --> 01:52:19,620
[SPEAKER_02]: BEEP!

1582
01:52:20,060 --> 01:52:22,021
[SPEAKER_02]: Beep!

1583
01:52:23,042 --> 01:52:23,282
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

1584
01:52:23,863 --> 01:52:24,963
[SPEAKER_02]: Square Tech Podcast.

1585
01:52:24,983 --> 01:52:26,585
[SPEAKER_02]: The first episode hasn't been posted yet.

1586
01:52:26,925 --> 01:52:27,645
[SPEAKER_02]: Beep!

1587
01:52:28,046 --> 01:52:32,249
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can view the site associated with my show at Beep!

1588
01:52:32,509 --> 01:52:34,770
[SPEAKER_02]: Where we talk about Beep!

1589
01:52:35,331 --> 01:52:36,291
[SPEAKER_02]: Beep!

1590
01:52:36,652 --> 01:52:38,173
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, you guys rock my socks.

1591
01:52:39,834 --> 01:52:41,275
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, it's squarepowered.com.

1592
01:52:43,417 --> 01:52:44,197
[SPEAKER_04]: You're so kind.

1593
01:52:44,497 --> 01:52:45,238
[SPEAKER_02]: Beep!

1594
01:52:46,383 --> 01:52:47,183
[SPEAKER_02]: Last email.

1595
01:52:48,164 --> 01:52:49,184
[SPEAKER_02]: Revised.

1596
01:52:49,425 --> 01:52:52,686
[SPEAKER_02]: Some tips on reducing the pain and cost of an account hack.

1597
01:52:53,627 --> 01:52:54,907
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, this is from Alan.

1598
01:52:56,248 --> 01:52:57,288
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to read the whole thing.

1599
01:52:58,329 --> 01:52:58,769
[SPEAKER_02]: OLR.

1600
01:52:59,469 --> 01:53:07,593
[SPEAKER_02]: So after what happened to Rob this weekend, I thought it might be nice to try and put together PSA on account fraud since I had to deal with so much of it at the porn place.

1601
01:53:08,554 --> 01:53:11,275
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep in mind... Sorry, I'm watching a video of NoLucaNo.

1602
01:53:11,315 --> 01:53:11,936
[SPEAKER_04]: It's adorable.

1603
01:53:13,283 --> 01:53:16,628
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't play it because it's got douchebags talking over it.

1604
01:53:17,790 --> 01:53:22,378
[SPEAKER_04]: All you do, all it is, you just push the stick to shoo the cat away.

1605
01:53:22,438 --> 01:53:23,019
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all it is.

1606
01:53:26,660 --> 01:53:28,141
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not your cereal, it's my cereal.

1607
01:53:28,161 --> 01:53:29,161
[SPEAKER_04]: That's so dopey, I love it.

1608
01:53:29,221 --> 01:53:30,202
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, serious topics.

1609
01:53:30,342 --> 01:53:31,282
[SPEAKER_04]: Xbox Live Hacking, yes.

1610
01:53:47,350 --> 01:53:56,534
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're comfortable confirming that the fraud is isolated to one account because the card used was on file and not actually revealed to anyone, try to have the firm handle it first.

1611
01:53:56,914 --> 01:54:04,798
[SPEAKER_02]: Some places refuse to do repeat business with a customer who has filed a chargeback against them without contacting them, which might matter if you want to keep a relationship with them.

1612
01:54:05,638 --> 01:54:12,402
[SPEAKER_02]: Many will panic and immediately have their bank kill and reissue everything, potentially overkill and an added nightmare of work if it is not truly needed.

1613
01:54:13,422 --> 01:54:14,823
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1614
01:54:35,323 --> 01:54:37,404
[SPEAKER_02]: 3.

1615
01:54:35,843 --> 01:54:37,404
[SPEAKER_02]: Sadly not everyone can do this one.

1616
01:54:37,484 --> 01:54:40,345
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep recurring digital services all on the same credit card.

1617
01:54:40,725 --> 01:54:46,907
[SPEAKER_02]: And most importantly, a card that has its balance against credit, not a debit card that has its balance against cash.

1618
01:54:47,548 --> 01:54:57,051
[SPEAKER_02]: If you decide that a firm sucks ass and you're over it, it's much easier for a bank to issue chargebacks against stolen credit versus real electronically transferred cash.

1619
01:54:57,611 --> 01:55:01,673
[SPEAKER_02]: So banks have little to no buyer protection when it comes to online fraud made against money.

1620
01:55:02,453 --> 01:55:22,342
[SPEAKER_02]: also be prepared to wait you can always escalate to a manager but generally telling people you need this money within 24 hours to pay rent or even if it is true will not accomplish much after making the rep feel like crap other than making the rep feel like crap that Rob has to wait 21 days after doing all of his due diligence to get a refund is not uncommon I can vouch for that too

1621
01:55:23,291 --> 01:55:23,351
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey!

1622
01:55:23,371 --> 01:55:23,991
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't give away my money.

1623
01:55:52,825 --> 01:55:59,510
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are all some good tips and I know he kind of used to work in a sales type of environment and probably had to deal right with all that stuff on the front line.

1624
01:56:01,491 --> 01:56:10,717
[SPEAKER_02]: Since I worked for a mortgage company too, I can tell you that it is incredibly easy for anyone who has a little bit of your personal information to call in and impersonate you.

1625
01:56:11,558 --> 01:56:13,439
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to tell you what I used to do.

1626
01:56:14,780 --> 01:56:22,122
[SPEAKER_02]: Every so often involved in mortgage situations when we would have people call in for payoffs on their mortgage.

1627
01:56:23,303 --> 01:56:25,584
[SPEAKER_02]: You see, is there a prepayment penalty, something like that.

1628
01:56:25,964 --> 01:56:36,027
[SPEAKER_02]: We would have the new loan officers call in and impersonate the customers because they had all of their personal information right there.

1629
01:56:36,907 --> 01:56:52,941
[SPEAKER_02]: and if I at any point ever suspected it then I would put them on hold call the customer and say I think someone's impersonating you I'm going to three-way you usually screwed you know a person out of a mortgage but we would have spouses call we'd have exes call in

1630
01:56:54,042 --> 01:56:56,406
[SPEAKER_02]: and because they were privy to all that information.

1631
01:56:57,507 --> 01:57:07,602
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing that will help is that with any of your facilities that you can work with on a phone, if they have a password set up verbally, set it up.

1632
01:57:09,356 --> 01:57:36,706
[SPEAKER_04]: I really don't like to talk about my day job on the show because I try to keep my work life and my night life separate but I will say that for many years I worked in a health insurance call center environment and I will tell you there's many strict laws about what type of information can be given because you're talking about people's health information there's strict federal laws about what can and can't be said in a conversation and honestly part of me is kind of like I think

1633
01:57:38,066 --> 01:57:41,929
[SPEAKER_04]: We need strict laws like that for everything, no matter what the industry is.

1634
01:57:43,730 --> 01:57:48,773
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of companies take good care, but clearly my information is at risk in some places.

1635
01:57:48,793 --> 01:57:50,874
[SPEAKER_02]: I was such a snot as a customer service rep.

1636
01:57:51,995 --> 01:57:56,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep in mind, I also took escalated calls because I got promoted to a training rep.

1637
01:57:58,899 --> 01:58:01,561
[SPEAKER_02]: I would actually start quoting the Federal Privacy Act.

1638
01:58:02,741 --> 01:58:08,643
[SPEAKER_02]: I had it saved as a PDF with parts highlighted and say, well, you can tell me that.

1639
01:58:08,683 --> 01:58:14,144
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, actually, according to the Federal Privacy Act, and would read them line for line, like, I want to talk to your manager.

1640
01:58:14,344 --> 01:58:16,145
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, my manager can't break the law either.

1641
01:58:17,425 --> 01:58:18,405
[SPEAKER_02]: And then just hang up.

1642
01:58:20,526 --> 01:58:20,846
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1643
01:58:21,306 --> 01:58:22,266
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, all good tips.

1644
01:58:22,486 --> 01:58:23,066
[SPEAKER_04]: All good tips.

1645
01:58:23,266 --> 01:58:25,507
[SPEAKER_04]: Things I probably should have listened to before this happened.

1646
01:58:25,547 --> 01:58:27,988
[SPEAKER_02]: I also want to say that the Federal Privacy Act came out in 1979, so look it up.

1647
01:58:31,107 --> 01:58:31,408
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, 1974.

1648
01:58:44,770 --> 01:58:45,350
[SPEAKER_04]: No, Luca.

1649
01:58:49,852 --> 01:58:50,052
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1650
01:58:51,673 --> 01:58:53,414
[SPEAKER_04]: Every time it's no, and I guess you get points.

1651
01:58:54,014 --> 01:58:54,935
[SPEAKER_04]: Every time you shoo him away.

1652
01:58:55,375 --> 01:58:57,416
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, does the game get harder as you go through?

1653
01:58:57,736 --> 01:58:58,176
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me see.

1654
01:58:58,876 --> 01:59:00,757
[SPEAKER_04]: Fine, just eat my breakfast.

1655
01:59:01,638 --> 01:59:02,898
[SPEAKER_04]: Fine, just eat my breakfast.

1656
01:59:02,998 --> 01:59:05,199
[SPEAKER_04]: And the cat meowed and ate breakfast.

1657
01:59:05,479 --> 01:59:08,201
[SPEAKER_02]: For the record, by the way, the Federal Privacy Act of 1974.

1658
01:59:09,361 --> 01:59:10,782
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, got pwned.

1659
01:59:11,562 --> 01:59:12,362
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no one told me.

1660
01:59:12,442 --> 01:59:12,963
[SPEAKER_01]: I just looked it up.

1661
01:59:13,403 --> 01:59:13,643
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1662
01:59:14,133 --> 01:59:16,154
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to know what this big flashing elephant is.

1663
01:59:17,514 --> 01:59:17,894
[SPEAKER_06]: In what?

1664
01:59:18,194 --> 01:59:19,475
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, VVVV?

1665
01:59:20,055 --> 01:59:21,035
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an elephant with a tear.

1666
01:59:21,975 --> 01:59:22,936
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe you made it cry.

1667
01:59:24,176 --> 01:59:28,177
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, speaking of making people cry, once in a while we like to rant on this program.

1668
01:59:28,217 --> 01:59:30,838
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called the FUs of the Week, and we're going to do that right now.

1669
01:59:47,214 --> 01:59:47,675
[SPEAKER_02]: F.U.

1670
01:59:48,936 --> 01:59:54,122
[SPEAKER_02]: to the unemployment office here in California for switching people over to debit cards.

1671
01:59:55,043 --> 01:59:56,805
[SPEAKER_02]: And the only reason I'm saying F.U.

1672
01:59:56,825 --> 01:59:58,166
[SPEAKER_02]: about this, actually, my F.U.

1673
01:59:58,206 --> 01:59:59,247
[SPEAKER_02]: is really the Bank of America.

1674
02:00:00,008 --> 02:00:06,395
[SPEAKER_02]: Because California Unemployment decided to go through Bank of America to issue debit cards, which, that's fine.

1675
02:00:06,555 --> 02:00:08,557
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no problem with a debit card.

1676
02:00:09,838 --> 02:00:38,848
[SPEAKER_02]: and so far it was actually fairly easy to set it up to do a direct deposit when my money comes in into my checking account so that's fine I just have to do my fill out my stupid form but I set it up for my first deposit to do that it's like no we're gonna set it up for every deposit afterwards it doesn't work on your first one so that means I have to go to the bank and have them do a manual transfer so Bank of America can suck my non-existent call Loki do you have any FUs of the week

1677
02:00:40,721 --> 02:00:47,746
[SPEAKER_06]: Um... I don't know if you get a KFC for only having 7 out of the 10 hot wings I won.

1678
02:00:49,107 --> 02:00:50,688
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you get shorted 3 hot wings?

1679
02:00:50,828 --> 02:00:54,071
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they said that, well, for some reason we only have 7.

1680
02:00:54,291 --> 02:00:56,093
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll give you chicken tenders instead.

1681
02:00:56,113 --> 02:00:56,913
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, eh, fine.

1682
02:00:57,894 --> 02:00:58,314
[SPEAKER_06]: That's funny.

1683
02:00:58,574 --> 02:00:59,715
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1684
02:00:59,735 --> 02:01:03,318
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, um... These are serious first world problems, Loki.

1685
02:01:03,678 --> 02:01:04,979
[SPEAKER_04]: Serious first world problems.

1686
02:01:06,152 --> 02:01:11,399
[SPEAKER_04]: Man, they substituted three of my hot wings for chicken tenders.

1687
02:01:11,480 --> 02:01:15,004
[SPEAKER_04]: My FU of the week goes to the fucker that stole 125 bucks from me.

1688
02:01:15,125 --> 02:01:16,546
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck you, you fucking fuck.

1689
02:01:18,509 --> 02:01:19,370
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel a little better.

1690
02:01:19,571 --> 02:01:21,153
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, burn his house down.

1691
02:01:22,294 --> 02:01:23,336
[SPEAKER_04]: No, don't burn my house down.

1692
02:01:24,079 --> 02:01:25,781
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I meant the fucker.

1693
02:01:26,721 --> 02:01:31,005
[SPEAKER_04]: It's probably... It's got to be some mass operation overseas somewhere that's doing it.

1694
02:01:31,146 --> 02:01:42,916
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet anything it's some other country where they've got a shop of people that are hacking all these Xbox Live accounts somehow that probably... The information was probably breached and Microsoft just doesn't know it yet.

1695
02:01:43,317 --> 02:01:45,579
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably got stolen the same time as Sony's, but whatever.

1696
02:01:45,599 --> 02:01:46,720
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to make stuff up, but...

1697
02:01:47,080 --> 02:01:49,083
[SPEAKER_04]: All I know is that I have money stolen and I'm pissed.

1698
02:01:50,245 --> 02:01:53,310
[SPEAKER_04]: But at least the lady that worked at Xbox.com was nice.

1699
02:01:53,911 --> 02:01:56,856
[SPEAKER_04]: She was nice enough to tell me that, hey, she's had money stolen from her, too.

1700
02:01:57,036 --> 02:01:57,236
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

1701
02:01:58,499 --> 02:01:58,979
[SPEAKER_04]: and DarkSakura.

1702
02:02:25,484 --> 02:02:26,465
[SPEAKER_04]: This is ridiculous.

1703
02:02:27,165 --> 02:02:30,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Microsoft keeps doing this and yet we all get mad at Sony.

1704
02:02:32,649 --> 02:02:32,909
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob.

1705
02:02:33,029 --> 02:02:33,249
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1706
02:02:33,369 --> 02:02:34,170
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just irritating.

1707
02:02:34,430 --> 02:02:34,690
[SPEAKER_04]: Heart.

1708
02:02:35,630 --> 02:02:36,391
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not mad at you.

1709
02:02:36,431 --> 02:02:40,053
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just mad at... I'm partially mad at myself for letting it happen.

1710
02:02:40,073 --> 02:02:41,434
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just kind of mad at Microsoft.

1711
02:02:41,494 --> 02:02:43,055
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just ridiculous.

1712
02:02:44,876 --> 02:02:45,136
[SPEAKER_04]: Rawr.

1713
02:02:46,257 --> 02:02:46,737
[SPEAKER_04]: Rawr.

1714
02:02:47,318 --> 02:02:47,518
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1715
02:02:48,038 --> 02:02:48,559
[SPEAKER_04]: Poor Rob.

1716
02:02:48,599 --> 02:02:49,519
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we move on to more news?

1717
02:02:49,739 --> 02:02:50,020
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

1718
02:02:52,481 --> 02:02:52,881
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

1719
02:02:53,622 --> 02:02:53,662
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

1720
02:02:55,140 --> 02:02:56,481
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is kind of cool.

1721
02:02:56,561 --> 02:03:03,207
[SPEAKER_06]: They're apparently going to be doing some new... I'm assuming it's just a port of Counter-Strike.

1722
02:03:03,928 --> 02:03:06,210
[SPEAKER_06]: Valve is putting out Counter-Strike Global Offensive.

1723
02:03:06,791 --> 02:03:11,795
[SPEAKER_06]: It's coming to Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network, and Steam early next year.

1724
02:03:12,636 --> 02:03:15,438
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course it's going to have new maps, characters, and weapons.

1725
02:03:16,379 --> 02:03:18,961
[SPEAKER_06]: And some renovated classic maps as well.

1726
02:03:19,982 --> 02:03:26,687
[SPEAKER_06]: and new modes, matchmaking options, leaderboards, all the usual stuff that they have in shooters nowadays.

1727
02:03:31,050 --> 02:03:33,592
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of cool that they're actually putting out a new game.

1728
02:03:33,692 --> 02:03:39,316
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone loves Valve games and I'm sure this one will be supported just as well as all the other stuff that they put out.

1729
02:03:39,776 --> 02:03:41,377
[SPEAKER_06]: And maybe they'll have hats someday.

1730
02:03:41,397 --> 02:03:44,480
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay hats.

1731
02:03:44,520 --> 02:03:44,800
[SPEAKER_06]: Hats.

1732
02:03:47,424 --> 02:04:00,951
[SPEAKER_06]: Some other cool stuff, of course, they're going to have a new decoy grenade, which is kind of cool, and some other new animations and models and whatnot.

1733
02:04:01,171 --> 02:04:07,715
[SPEAKER_06]: There's going to be a new heavy machine gun, a new range of shotguns, specifically for close-up combat.

1734
02:04:08,115 --> 02:04:17,423
[SPEAKER_06]: Molotov, uh, cocktail grenades, and, um, I guess, uh, some stuff for cutting off certain areas of the map.

1735
02:04:17,943 --> 02:04:26,290
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, uh, basically a decoy grenade, which it'll do is it'll send out a burst of gunfire from wherever it's thrown.

1736
02:04:26,390 --> 02:04:31,935
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you want to make someone think that you're in one place that you're not, then you can do that.

1737
02:04:32,475 --> 02:04:33,096
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, um,

1738
02:04:35,495 --> 02:04:38,957
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess they also have some other stuff that they're tweaking.

1739
02:04:40,198 --> 02:04:42,720
[SPEAKER_06]: Gunfire for different weapons and stuff like that.

1740
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:54,488
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, they're going to have, I guess, different things where they're going to give everybody Kevlar, the round starter, making people have to defuse bombs and stuff like that.

1741
02:04:54,888 --> 02:04:58,330
[SPEAKER_06]: So it sounds like they're trying to tweak up the gameplay and stuff like that.

1742
02:04:58,350 --> 02:04:59,751
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1743
02:04:59,912 --> 02:05:00,492
[SPEAKER_06]: It sounds good to me.

1744
02:05:03,601 --> 02:05:05,322
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you excited for a new Counter-Strike game?

1745
02:05:05,362 --> 02:05:08,683
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I own the old one on Xbox, even though I am terrible at it.

1746
02:05:08,943 --> 02:05:22,549
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I maybe played online once, and I was so terrible, I got screamed at, and I just... You know, I've never really played the original, but I know it's definitely popular, so, I mean... I don't know, this should do well.

1747
02:05:23,049 --> 02:05:27,731
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's one of the first major military first-person shooter games that they had out there, so...

1748
02:05:30,566 --> 02:05:31,206
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it'll do well.

1749
02:05:31,526 --> 02:05:34,087
[SPEAKER_04]: So can I read a text message I just got from Extifer?

1750
02:05:34,347 --> 02:05:34,608
[SPEAKER_04]: Do it.

1751
02:05:34,648 --> 02:05:35,748
[SPEAKER_04]: My co-host over on Horde House.

1752
02:05:36,048 --> 02:05:38,569
[SPEAKER_04]: No, this is hilarious.

1753
02:05:38,609 --> 02:05:39,009
[SPEAKER_04]: Here you go.

1754
02:05:39,950 --> 02:05:49,273
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, I just thought you should know that, insert person's name redacted here, Xbox account and money got hacked a few weeks ago, just in case you're talking about it on the show tonight.

1755
02:05:49,633 --> 02:05:51,594
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope, that's person number five I know that's been hacked.

1756
02:05:52,174 --> 02:05:52,934
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought that was six.

1757
02:05:54,195 --> 02:05:56,816
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever, it's a fucking lot of people that this is happening to, and...

1758
02:05:58,598 --> 02:06:01,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing's going on Microsoft, but Sony needs to provide free debix.

1759
02:06:02,443 --> 02:06:03,744
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to have Dan check ours now.

1760
02:06:04,405 --> 02:06:05,066
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously.

1761
02:06:05,427 --> 02:06:07,109
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm telling you guys, change your fucking passwords.

1762
02:06:07,149 --> 02:06:07,730
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, do it.

1763
02:06:09,959 --> 02:06:10,720
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, moving on.

1764
02:06:12,100 --> 02:06:12,601
[SPEAKER_04]: Other news.

1765
02:06:12,981 --> 02:06:15,422
[SPEAKER_04]: This is about Kingdom Hearts.

1766
02:06:16,663 --> 02:06:18,143
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's not news about Kingdom Hearts 3.

1767
02:06:18,584 --> 02:06:18,884
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

1768
02:06:19,144 --> 02:06:23,026
[SPEAKER_04]: But there is, of course, Kingdom Hearts 3D or Dream Drop Distance.

1769
02:06:23,306 --> 02:06:23,586
[SPEAKER_04]: Get it?

1770
02:06:24,326 --> 02:06:26,207
[SPEAKER_04]: That is coming out, I guess, soon.

1771
02:06:26,547 --> 02:06:29,929
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to be getting a hands-on if you're going to the Tokyo Game Show in the fall.

1772
02:06:30,889 --> 02:06:38,073
[SPEAKER_04]: However, what's also interesting in the Kingdom Hearts universe is in the latest issue of the Japanese magazine Dengeki PlayStation,

1773
02:06:39,073 --> 02:07:00,401
[SPEAKER_04]: Tetsuya Nomura actually said that it's becoming difficult to get new players into the series with each new iteration well the plot's kind of complicated I'm not too surprised at that but what's also interesting about it as a celebration of the franchise's 10th anniversary he hopes to release an HD technical test of the series what?

1774
02:07:01,241 --> 02:07:04,944
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that mean like a tech demo like Final Fantasy 7?

1775
02:07:05,845 --> 02:07:07,847
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it mean remakes of the first game?

1776
02:07:08,007 --> 02:07:10,189
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you're talking about trying to get people into it?

1777
02:07:10,669 --> 02:07:11,510
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be awesome.

1778
02:07:12,410 --> 02:07:12,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?

1779
02:07:13,231 --> 02:07:16,494
[SPEAKER_04]: But perhaps there's more information at Tokyo Game Show next month.

1780
02:07:16,994 --> 02:07:18,214
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, don't tease me like that.

1781
02:07:18,675 --> 02:07:21,736
[SPEAKER_04]: That's terrible that they're teasing us so terribly with that.

1782
02:07:23,336 --> 02:07:24,097
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see what happens.

1783
02:07:24,677 --> 02:07:28,078
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, DarkSakura, do you think Kingdom Hearts is a tough series for people to get into?

1784
02:07:28,558 --> 02:07:29,158
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think so.

1785
02:07:29,999 --> 02:07:35,881
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I don't think it's like... I mean, it is a weird plot, but it did always kind of fascinate me.

1786
02:07:35,921 --> 02:07:38,902
[SPEAKER_04]: Kingdom Hearts was sort of for kids, but not really.

1787
02:07:39,602 --> 02:07:41,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably older kids, definitely.

1788
02:07:41,363 --> 02:07:44,464
[SPEAKER_04]: But a young kid would never understand that plot.

1789
02:07:44,504 --> 02:07:45,104
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, it's...

1790
02:07:45,734 --> 02:07:48,455
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is Mickey wearing black and has a sword?

1791
02:07:48,475 --> 02:07:49,475
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really convoluted.

1792
02:07:49,735 --> 02:07:59,557
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think that's why people really love Kingdom Hearts is that it is a little bit the darker side of Disney, which, you know, Epic Mickey sort of tried to do, but eh.

1793
02:07:59,997 --> 02:08:00,257
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1794
02:08:00,557 --> 02:08:00,777
[SPEAKER_02]: So.

1795
02:08:01,957 --> 02:08:03,518
[SPEAKER_02]: And Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.

1796
02:08:03,698 --> 02:08:03,898
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1797
02:08:04,458 --> 02:08:07,479
[SPEAKER_02]: You made a grammatical error.

1798
02:08:07,739 --> 02:08:08,259
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

1799
02:08:08,299 --> 02:08:08,839
[SPEAKER_04]: What did I do now?

1800
02:08:10,120 --> 02:08:20,505
[SPEAKER_02]: You use an apostrophe for it Oh my gosh It's a radio show, nobody sees that I do Well, how about I just use that to go ahead and get into my news then?

1801
02:08:21,326 --> 02:08:26,829
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure Okay Australia is getting an R18 plus rating Finally!

1802
02:08:27,809 --> 02:08:35,173
[SPEAKER_02]: Get with it, Australia They actually have it added to their new rating system so that they can have mature games

1803
02:08:38,479 --> 02:08:39,140
[SPEAKER_04]: It's about time.

1804
02:08:39,400 --> 02:08:42,002
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead of just banning them outright, you know.

1805
02:08:43,283 --> 02:08:46,225
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe Mortal Kombat will finally come out in Australia legitimately.

1806
02:08:46,485 --> 02:08:46,826
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.

1807
02:08:47,026 --> 02:08:48,787
[SPEAKER_04]: And some of the other games that have been banned there recently.

1808
02:08:48,907 --> 02:08:57,174
[SPEAKER_02]: But, I mean, if you look at it from a financial point of view, putting the ratings out there and allowing these games to come out instead of banning them is revenue.

1809
02:08:57,734 --> 02:08:58,515
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to be awesome.

1810
02:08:58,535 --> 02:09:02,738
[SPEAKER_04]: There's going to be an explosion of violent and graphic games in Australia really soon.

1811
02:09:03,234 --> 02:09:07,216
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and kangaroos will run all over you and punch you in the face.

1812
02:09:07,236 --> 02:09:10,138
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll have a bunch of unrated editions come out.

1813
02:09:10,318 --> 02:09:12,639
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it wasn't in the show role, but did you hear about the fuckery?

1814
02:09:12,859 --> 02:09:17,902
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I'm sure you heard about the fuckery that was going on in Britain this week with all the rioting and all that stuff.

1815
02:09:17,922 --> 02:09:18,742
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so awful.

1816
02:09:18,983 --> 02:09:23,625
[SPEAKER_04]: It's terrible, but the real fuckery I'm talking about is how people wanted to blame all that on Grand Theft Auto.

1817
02:09:24,085 --> 02:09:26,106
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, of course, you gotta blame it on something.

1818
02:09:26,146 --> 02:09:28,068
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't just blame it on fuckers being fuckers.

1819
02:09:28,628 --> 02:09:28,848
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1820
02:09:29,560 --> 02:09:30,180
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1821
02:09:42,836 --> 02:09:48,678
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, on top of that... I mean, there's trashy people everywhere, but I just, you know, you didn't think it would happen there in jolly old England.

1822
02:09:48,838 --> 02:09:53,359
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you see the thing I put on my Tumblr about the old man's barbershop?

1823
02:09:53,940 --> 02:09:54,060
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1824
02:09:54,500 --> 02:10:00,742
[SPEAKER_02]: There was an elderly gentleman whose shop got ransacked, and he had owned it with his wife, and his wife passed away.

1825
02:10:01,622 --> 02:10:04,203
[SPEAKER_02]: And they, like, completely tore up his barbershop.

1826
02:10:04,243 --> 02:10:06,884
[SPEAKER_02]: He'd had it for something like, I want to say, 40 years.

1827
02:10:07,084 --> 02:10:07,464
[SPEAKER_02]: How sad.

1828
02:10:08,044 --> 02:10:14,406
[SPEAKER_02]: and that he'd have to go out of business, but there's actually an online group going around raising money to rebuild his store.

1829
02:10:15,686 --> 02:10:16,986
[SPEAKER_02]: If I can find it, I'll link it in the chat room.

1830
02:10:17,546 --> 02:10:18,847
[SPEAKER_04]: But I thought that was a nice touch.

1831
02:10:20,847 --> 02:10:27,109
[SPEAKER_04]: RDGSinge in the chat is throwing back to something last week, but wants to ask DarkSakura a question, and I guess now's a good time.

1832
02:10:27,509 --> 02:10:28,749
[SPEAKER_04]: Any updates on the tester?

1833
02:10:29,369 --> 02:10:30,069
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember last week?

1834
02:10:30,469 --> 02:10:32,310
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I've been upgraded to contestant.

1835
02:10:32,330 --> 02:10:33,010
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

1836
02:10:33,030 --> 02:10:33,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Really.

1837
02:10:34,355 --> 02:10:36,316
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that means I have to do a stupid video.

1838
02:10:37,016 --> 02:10:41,578
[SPEAKER_02]: But now I kind of, I mean, there's part of me that doesn't want to because I don't want to be away from Dan.

1839
02:10:42,879 --> 02:10:43,039
[SPEAKER_04]: Aww.

1840
02:10:43,379 --> 02:10:46,681
[SPEAKER_02]: Because when he was gone for five days and it made me sad.

1841
02:10:46,821 --> 02:10:48,061
[SPEAKER_04]: It's only going to be a few days.

1842
02:10:48,201 --> 02:10:51,643
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't think it's like Survivor where you can't call people.

1843
02:10:51,843 --> 02:10:54,064
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they let you talk to your family and stuff.

1844
02:10:54,828 --> 02:10:58,252
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure they do, but I mean, I don't like L.A.

1845
02:10:58,352 --> 02:10:58,613
[SPEAKER_02]: either.

1846
02:10:59,453 --> 02:11:02,697
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd just be like, we're done taping, bye, I'm going to Disneyland.

1847
02:11:03,918 --> 02:11:05,340
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd just hang out with Marissa all the time.

1848
02:11:05,920 --> 02:11:07,142
[SPEAKER_04]: You'd be with other nerds.

1849
02:11:07,482 --> 02:11:10,746
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, of course, they're purposely going to cast people, they're going to drive you bonkers.

1850
02:11:11,326 --> 02:11:14,930
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, if you don't kill them, you might get a job and a couple thousand dollars.

1851
02:11:15,811 --> 02:11:16,151
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.

1852
02:11:17,491 --> 02:11:19,972
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I got my account upgrade a few days ago.

1853
02:11:20,352 --> 02:11:21,152
[SPEAKER_04]: Woohoo, I guess.

1854
02:11:21,692 --> 02:11:24,713
[SPEAKER_04]: So now you are an official contestant of Tester Season 3.

1855
02:11:24,753 --> 02:11:25,013
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay.

1856
02:11:25,033 --> 02:11:26,613
[SPEAKER_04]: This bothers me.

1857
02:11:26,633 --> 02:11:28,114
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why I'm so bothered by this.

1858
02:11:29,474 --> 02:11:29,754
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1859
02:11:30,234 --> 02:11:32,895
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, Loki, we got a couple more news stories for you guys.

1860
02:11:32,915 --> 02:11:34,055
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we're going to open up the Skype line.

1861
02:11:34,655 --> 02:11:36,236
[SPEAKER_04]: Folks, I need to put this out here.

1862
02:11:36,336 --> 02:11:38,236
[SPEAKER_04]: The 800 number is not working tonight.

1863
02:11:39,156 --> 02:11:42,577
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can only Skype us tonight at Orange Lounge Radio.

1864
02:11:42,617 --> 02:11:43,697
[SPEAKER_04]: The problem is temporary.

1865
02:11:44,097 --> 02:11:45,538
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll hopefully be fixed by next week.

1866
02:11:45,578 --> 02:11:49,419
[SPEAKER_04]: But just a heads up, you can only Skype us tonight at Orange Lounge Radio.

1867
02:11:49,479 --> 02:11:52,600
[SPEAKER_04]: So the 877 number again, not working tonight.

1868
02:11:52,660 --> 02:11:53,380
[SPEAKER_04]: Please don't use it.

1869
02:11:53,880 --> 02:11:55,080
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.

1870
02:11:55,240 --> 02:11:56,941
[SPEAKER_04]: But first, a couple more stories for you guys.

1871
02:11:57,961 --> 02:12:04,726
[SPEAKER_06]: Now normally you don't hear of some wild successes on Xbox Live Indie games, but there is one.

1872
02:12:05,186 --> 02:12:09,008
[SPEAKER_06]: And this should come as no surprise, seeing as it's kind of a clone of another game.

1873
02:12:09,709 --> 02:12:16,953
[SPEAKER_06]: FortressCraft, the kind of Minecraft knockoff, has sold 350,000 copies and brought in over a million dollars.

1874
02:12:22,798 --> 02:12:31,787
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh, they said, of course, no, it's not really like Minecraft, it's more of like Dwarf Fortress, but it's Minecraft, okay?

1875
02:12:32,147 --> 02:12:33,729
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it looks like goddamn Minecraft.

1876
02:12:34,209 --> 02:12:42,117
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um, it is the, probably the best-selling, I would imagine the best-selling game on Xbox Live Indie Games, it's making a million dollars.

1877
02:12:43,835 --> 02:12:44,756
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's pretty good.

1878
02:12:46,819 --> 02:12:51,684
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently there is an 84% trial to purchase conversion rate, which is pretty impressive if you ask me.

1879
02:12:52,685 --> 02:12:53,847
[SPEAKER_06]: 400,823 copies sold.

1880
02:13:02,064 --> 02:13:03,565
[SPEAKER_06]: They have a bunch of different statistics.

1881
02:13:03,625 --> 02:13:07,566
[SPEAKER_06]: It's funny in there.

1882
02:13:07,746 --> 02:13:12,268
[SPEAKER_06]: 96,197,520 Microsoft points spent on the game.

1883
02:13:13,489 --> 02:13:16,730
[SPEAKER_06]: Most of the purchases being in the US, followed by Great Britain and Canada.

1884
02:13:20,712 --> 02:13:24,654
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess that's good news for Minecraft when it comes out over here.

1885
02:13:24,674 --> 02:13:25,734
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks like people want it.

1886
02:13:27,975 --> 02:13:28,735
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1887
02:13:29,596 --> 02:13:30,096
[SPEAKER_01]: Good thing.

1888
02:13:31,757 --> 02:13:32,057
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1889
02:13:32,557 --> 02:13:37,699
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, one more story for you guys, then we're going to open up the Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.

1890
02:13:38,600 --> 02:13:43,642
[SPEAKER_04]: And this has to do with the game Rage that's going to be coming out fairly soon.

1891
02:13:43,682 --> 02:13:47,324
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, this is a new FPS franchise that's coming out.

1892
02:13:48,164 --> 02:13:57,388
[SPEAKER_04]: Tim Wiltis, who is the ID Software Creative Director, of course, ID Software is putting out this game, he says that the access to the game's underground...

1893
02:13:57,628 --> 02:14:01,351
[SPEAKER_04]: will be restricted to those who get their copy new at retail.

1894
02:14:01,632 --> 02:14:02,753
[SPEAKER_04]: Excuse me, new at retail.

1895
02:14:04,054 --> 02:14:06,496
[SPEAKER_04]: He's saying, you've played Rage five times.

1896
02:14:06,797 --> 02:14:08,678
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you ever found any sewer hatches?

1897
02:14:09,219 --> 02:14:11,901
[SPEAKER_04]: If you bought the game new, that would be open for you.

1898
02:14:12,562 --> 02:14:15,444
[SPEAKER_04]: So he says, you still have to download it, but you don't have to pay for it.

1899
02:14:15,585 --> 02:14:16,766
[SPEAKER_04]: Those hatches are all over.

1900
02:14:17,146 --> 02:14:21,570
[SPEAKER_04]: Most people never find them, but as soon as you do, you're like, oh, and then you start to look for it.

1901
02:14:21,650 --> 02:14:23,412
[SPEAKER_04]: That's our first time buyer incentive.

1902
02:14:23,792 --> 02:14:50,389
[SPEAKER_04]: so instead of doing an online pass or whatever a lot of companies are doing I guess there's these new little zone for lack of a better word that you can explore but only if you are a new game owner otherwise you may never notice it's there I guess because it's all in the sewer and what I understand none of the main storyline happens in the sewer I guess this is all like side quests so it's basically additional content that's only available when you buy it new

1903
02:14:51,741 --> 02:14:59,045
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, it's not additional content because if it's already on the disc and you're just unlocking access to it, then it's not additional.

1904
02:14:59,185 --> 02:15:02,226
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, if it's some download content, then that's a little different.

1905
02:15:02,827 --> 02:15:05,928
[SPEAKER_06]: But I have a feeling this is crap that's already on the disc.

1906
02:15:05,988 --> 02:15:09,510
[SPEAKER_06]: They're just allowing you access to it, which is kind of lame.

1907
02:15:12,955 --> 02:15:14,859
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well we're going to go ahead and open up the Skype line.

1908
02:15:14,919 --> 02:15:17,023
[SPEAKER_04]: We are Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.

1909
02:15:17,043 --> 02:15:19,187
[SPEAKER_04]: You can go ahead and give us a call on Skype.

1910
02:15:19,328 --> 02:15:23,155
[SPEAKER_04]: In the meantime, we're going to check the Twitter and go to some Twitter topics.

1911
02:15:25,979 --> 02:15:31,123
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to the Twitter right now, twitter.com of course slash OLR if you want to send us some tweets.

1912
02:15:31,763 --> 02:15:37,687
[SPEAKER_04]: Meanwhile, let's go on to some tweets.

1913
02:15:37,867 --> 02:15:51,717
[SPEAKER_04]: Starting off with Flocko Jones, who I guess must be listening live tonight because he's tweeting us and saying, LulzSec announced in mid-June that they released Xbox Live account information and Microsoft did nothing.

1914
02:15:51,966 --> 02:15:52,947
[SPEAKER_06]: Xbox Live, Facebook, etc.

1915
02:16:22,156 --> 02:16:22,516
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

1916
02:16:22,536 --> 02:16:37,321
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and it does say that the story is appended with an update that says Microsoft released a statement that Xbox Live was not compromised to the best of Microsoft's knowledge and the login's passwords were released at random with people encouraged to try the information on services like Xbox Live.

1917
02:16:37,661 --> 02:16:39,022
[SPEAKER_04]: And I do remember that happening.

1918
02:16:39,062 --> 02:16:42,543
[SPEAKER_04]: I do remember when they released like a big list of login and passwords and all that stuff, so...

1919
02:16:45,524 --> 02:16:54,729
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, Flaco Jones in the tweet says to us, maybe if Microsoft took Xbox Live down for a month when they most likely knew account info had been compromised, no money would have been stolen.

1920
02:16:55,669 --> 02:16:56,990
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of like I guess Sony did.

1921
02:16:57,950 --> 02:16:59,511
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

1922
02:16:59,551 --> 02:17:06,375
[SPEAKER_04]: Going to another tweet here from Nico Nico Chan tweets us saying, I heard from a friend that DarkSakura likes Parapara.

1923
02:17:07,095 --> 02:17:10,717
[SPEAKER_04]: I was wondering what Parapara dancers she watched on YouTube, if she does.

1924
02:17:12,117 --> 02:17:13,098
[SPEAKER_01]: I just watch whatever I find.

1925
02:17:13,658 --> 02:17:14,758
[SPEAKER_04]: You're just kind of a YouTuber.

1926
02:17:14,798 --> 02:17:16,298
[SPEAKER_04]: It's more the songs for you, isn't it?

1927
02:17:16,899 --> 02:17:17,459
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah.

1928
02:17:17,499 --> 02:17:18,999
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's certain dances that I like.

1929
02:17:19,039 --> 02:17:21,380
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the one for Velfar.

1930
02:17:21,920 --> 02:17:22,981
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a number of them that I like.

1931
02:17:23,361 --> 02:17:28,382
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'll find different groups and see different people doing them.

1932
02:17:28,782 --> 02:17:31,983
[SPEAKER_04]: For those that don't know what Parapara is, how can you best describe it to people?

1933
02:17:32,163 --> 02:17:33,284
[SPEAKER_01]: Cheerleading and line dancing.

1934
02:17:34,184 --> 02:17:35,664
[SPEAKER_04]: Cheerleading and line dancing combined.

1935
02:17:36,905 --> 02:17:38,145
[SPEAKER_04]: How would you classify the music?

1936
02:17:40,066 --> 02:17:40,426
[SPEAKER_01]: Synth-y.

1937
02:17:41,331 --> 02:17:46,053
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me play you an example of a song from Para Para Paradise, just in case you've never heard.

1938
02:17:46,354 --> 02:17:48,615
[SPEAKER_04]: So imagine doing like... Play Valpar if you have it.

1939
02:17:49,095 --> 02:17:50,235
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't have that one ready, sorry.

1940
02:17:50,676 --> 02:17:51,936
[SPEAKER_04]: This is like cheer dancing.

1941
02:17:51,976 --> 02:17:52,317
[SPEAKER_04]: Here you go.

1942
02:17:58,860 --> 02:18:01,501
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie is actually waving her hands here in the studio.

1943
02:18:01,861 --> 02:18:03,062
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one that I used to know.

1944
02:18:10,449 --> 02:18:11,050
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

1945
02:18:35,729 --> 02:18:37,050
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Rob, that's not possible.

1946
02:18:37,590 --> 02:18:37,990
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut up.

1947
02:18:39,291 --> 02:18:39,631
[SPEAKER_04]: Heart.

1948
02:18:40,151 --> 02:18:43,212
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to find Like a Virgin because it has the funniest intro ever.

1949
02:18:43,272 --> 02:18:44,133
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on, I've got to find it.

1950
02:18:46,634 --> 02:18:48,695
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you miss the Parapara machine that was here locally?

1951
02:18:48,855 --> 02:18:49,115
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I do.

1952
02:18:49,135 --> 02:18:50,135
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you said something about that.

1953
02:18:50,956 --> 02:18:54,017
[SPEAKER_02]: And someone's supposed to lend me Dance Masters so I can do Night of Fire.

1954
02:18:54,637 --> 02:18:55,558
[SPEAKER_02]: You know Night of Fire.

1955
02:18:56,598 --> 02:18:58,099
[SPEAKER_04]: I do now thanks to Dance Masters.

1956
02:18:59,219 --> 02:19:00,260
[SPEAKER_04]: So, where is it?

1957
02:19:00,320 --> 02:19:00,580
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't.

1958
02:19:03,736 --> 02:19:05,797
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on, I got one other directory I gotta check.

1959
02:19:05,997 --> 02:19:10,217
[SPEAKER_04]: This is awesome live radio, but hold on, I gotta check one more folder here.

1960
02:19:12,118 --> 02:19:13,398
[SPEAKER_02]: Hurry up, we got Pinkberry.

1961
02:19:14,358 --> 02:19:20,339
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to have the entirety of DDR Freak's radios rotation here on the computer.

1962
02:19:21,499 --> 02:19:23,540
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm pretty sure they had it in their rotation.

1963
02:19:26,140 --> 02:19:26,440
[SPEAKER_04]: Here it is.

1964
02:19:27,080 --> 02:19:27,280
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1965
02:19:27,940 --> 02:19:28,820
[SPEAKER_04]: Hilarious opening.

1966
02:19:29,220 --> 02:19:32,061
[SPEAKER_04]: And the band, of course, is called Virgin L. So here you go.

1967
02:19:48,600 --> 02:19:56,563
[SPEAKER_04]: Zether in chat says, when I dance to Eurobeat, I pretend to drive a car really fast down a mountain pass, shifting the gears of my hands and the steering wheel movements.

1968
02:19:56,803 --> 02:19:58,984
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not Initial D. I'm sorry.

1969
02:19:59,244 --> 02:20:07,967
[SPEAKER_02]: It is Initial D. Initial D. Most of these performers, by the way, the bands are out of Italy.

1970
02:20:09,940 --> 02:20:11,041
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.

1971
02:20:11,061 --> 02:20:12,482
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, Skype line is open, guys.

1972
02:20:13,843 --> 02:20:16,485
[SPEAKER_04]: Going to Tigerclaw sends us a couple tweets here.

1973
02:20:16,605 --> 02:20:22,250
[SPEAKER_04]: One of them has to do with Nintendo looking at trademark applications for Wii U in the U.S.

1974
02:20:22,310 --> 02:20:28,595
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, this is not just, I think, what DarkSakura was talking about earlier, but some other related things, such as...

1975
02:20:29,275 --> 02:20:58,859
[SPEAKER_04]: point cards, advertising and publicity services for providing information let's see, telecommunication via electronic bulletin boards providing images via communication with handheld game devices clothing for domestic pets bags and the like and so forth oh god, you know what game that is clothing, waistbands, belts for clothing card games notebooks consumer video game machines fitted with a camera function meaning I guess the camera's already built in

1976
02:20:59,266 --> 02:21:11,067
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm Interesting IDK Alright, also TigerClaw tweets us another tweet Sony wants to know what Playstation Vita peripherals you want What do you want to see on the Vita?

1977
02:21:12,927 --> 02:21:32,937
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess some of the responses that are showing up on this poll so far It's on the Japanese PlayStation Vita community site A UMD drive A cradle with HDMI out A compact full keyboard A grip adapter with a secondary battery built in UMD drive is by far the most popular response so far How about a USB connector?

1978
02:21:34,316 --> 02:21:37,098
[SPEAKER_04]: That might be already there, I think.

1979
02:21:38,259 --> 02:21:40,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Loki's confirming that it's already there.

1980
02:21:41,782 --> 02:21:44,104
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, Orange Laundry on Skype if you want to give us a call tonight.

1981
02:21:44,124 --> 02:21:49,388
[SPEAKER_02]: You should have one of those paypoint things where you put your card up to the sensor and it charges you.

1982
02:21:50,366 --> 02:21:51,427
[SPEAKER_02]: Here, I don't have to enter anything.

1983
02:21:51,447 --> 02:21:52,267
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just buy all of this.

1984
02:21:52,567 --> 02:21:56,149
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkTetsuya says, we should totally start bees for Xenoblade.

1985
02:21:56,189 --> 02:21:56,929
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a hashtag.

1986
02:21:56,970 --> 02:21:57,510
[SPEAKER_04]: Just saying.

1987
02:21:58,650 --> 02:21:59,471
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want.

1988
02:21:59,511 --> 02:22:01,392
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe it'll catch on like President Cat.

1989
02:22:01,452 --> 02:22:02,052
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do it.

1990
02:22:03,693 --> 02:22:04,093
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1991
02:22:04,413 --> 02:22:04,853
[SPEAKER_02]: Go for it.

1992
02:22:04,894 --> 02:22:06,895
[SPEAKER_02]: If you think it should be done, you should start that.

1993
02:22:08,315 --> 02:22:10,096
[SPEAKER_04]: I will endorse bees for Xenoblade.

1994
02:22:10,136 --> 02:22:10,576
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

1995
02:22:11,177 --> 02:22:11,457
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1996
02:22:11,697 --> 02:22:12,597
[SPEAKER_04]: We got a call coming in.

1997
02:22:12,617 --> 02:22:14,358
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to the phones and take the call.

1998
02:22:14,598 --> 02:22:15,499
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1999
02:22:15,519 --> 02:22:15,859
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

2000
02:22:17,180 --> 02:22:17,460
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello?

2001
02:22:17,860 --> 02:22:18,961
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2002
02:22:18,981 --> 02:22:19,281
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

2003
02:22:20,305 --> 02:22:21,306
[SPEAKER_00]: TheWordNate again.

2004
02:22:21,686 --> 02:22:22,467
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, what's up, Nate?

2005
02:22:23,588 --> 02:22:28,633
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, dude, I was calling about the indie thing, the indie gaming.

2006
02:22:29,133 --> 02:22:29,353
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

2007
02:22:30,494 --> 02:22:31,635
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm an indie game developer.

2008
02:22:31,956 --> 02:22:33,937
[SPEAKER_04]: You are an indie game developer yourself.

2009
02:22:34,918 --> 02:22:35,219
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

2010
02:22:35,399 --> 02:22:36,600
[SPEAKER_04]: What games are you developing?

2011
02:22:38,019 --> 02:22:39,380
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't laugh at me now.

2012
02:22:39,921 --> 02:22:42,683
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm making a farming game right now.

2013
02:22:43,503 --> 02:22:44,044
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, God.

2014
02:22:44,084 --> 02:22:45,285
[SPEAKER_04]: A farming game?

2015
02:22:46,065 --> 02:22:46,626
[SPEAKER_00]: But hold on.

2016
02:22:46,726 --> 02:22:48,547
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like Farmville.

2017
02:22:49,007 --> 02:22:51,789
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more like Monopoly mixed with Harvest Moon.

2018
02:22:52,710 --> 02:22:52,870
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

2019
02:22:52,890 --> 02:22:54,031
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, people like Harvest Moon.

2020
02:22:54,411 --> 02:22:54,932
[SPEAKER_04]: So, okay.

2021
02:22:54,972 --> 02:22:55,652
[SPEAKER_04]: And Monopoly.

2022
02:22:55,732 --> 02:22:56,733
[SPEAKER_04]: Monopoly is a fun game.

2023
02:22:57,093 --> 02:23:05,039
[SPEAKER_04]: I read the most weird news story ever this week that was talking about how in Monopoly, you actually don't want to own Boardwalk.

2024
02:23:05,079 --> 02:23:06,700
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to own Illinois Avenue.

2025
02:23:07,461 --> 02:23:11,322
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I saw the article too, but I didn't read it.

2026
02:23:11,362 --> 02:23:14,283
[SPEAKER_00]: I just saw it and said, these people don't know what they're talking about.

2027
02:23:16,583 --> 02:23:18,044
[SPEAKER_04]: So the game's not out yet then.

2028
02:23:18,064 --> 02:23:19,584
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have anything to plug just yet.

2029
02:23:20,464 --> 02:23:26,086
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you want to give away all the secrets, but how do you combine the worlds of Monopoly and Harvest Moon?

2030
02:23:27,543 --> 02:23:40,676
[SPEAKER_00]: well in the game you really um okay you're trying to start a farming monopoly so um you start off as a small farmer and then later down the road you just you just uh you just get opportunities to take over other people's farms and um

2031
02:23:41,591 --> 02:23:42,472
[SPEAKER_00]: Get new property.

2032
02:23:42,852 --> 02:23:44,532
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to get the government to help you out.

2033
02:23:45,013 --> 02:23:48,594
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a lot of crazy, like... We get to take over people's farms with guns?

2034
02:23:49,975 --> 02:23:51,395
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you get to put them out of business.

2035
02:23:51,755 --> 02:23:53,896
[SPEAKER_05]: You're producing government-supported crops.

2036
02:23:55,477 --> 02:23:57,538
[SPEAKER_05]: You're encouraging people to grow government cheese.

2037
02:23:59,633 --> 02:24:00,654
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's good, isn't it?

2038
02:24:01,134 --> 02:24:09,418
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, but you know your game's probably going to get, like, targeted by the organic growers of America or something.

2039
02:24:10,858 --> 02:24:13,680
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, especially the Slow Food International.

2040
02:24:14,560 --> 02:24:15,360
[SPEAKER_04]: And the Tea Party.

2041
02:24:16,201 --> 02:24:17,761
[SPEAKER_02]: No, the Tea Party's all down for that.

2042
02:24:18,261 --> 02:24:19,622
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't care about organic food.

2043
02:24:19,642 --> 02:24:24,004
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say that crops are organic in the game, even though they aren't.

2044
02:24:25,840 --> 02:24:29,516
[SPEAKER_02]: if you have organic ones then you need to have them cost more

2045
02:24:31,127 --> 02:24:35,828
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it didn't get bad quicker than it tastes worse.

2046
02:24:36,469 --> 02:24:37,929
[SPEAKER_00]: But whatever.

2047
02:24:38,069 --> 02:24:39,690
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, let me ask you this.

2048
02:24:39,790 --> 02:24:42,471
[SPEAKER_04]: Where did you get the idea to develop a game like this?

2049
02:24:42,491 --> 02:24:43,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, what inspired you?

2050
02:24:43,331 --> 02:24:47,472
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, you know, people got to remember, you don't write an indie game in one night.

2051
02:24:47,692 --> 02:24:51,913
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I guess you can, but that's, you know, most of them definitely are not done in one night.

2052
02:24:52,053 --> 02:24:53,954
[SPEAKER_04]: They take a long time to develop.

2053
02:24:54,234 --> 02:24:55,975
[SPEAKER_04]: So you really have to be committed to your idea.

2054
02:24:56,055 --> 02:24:58,616
[SPEAKER_04]: So where did you get the idea that I want to do a...

2055
02:25:00,296 --> 02:25:02,779
[SPEAKER_04]: Farming game that's not Farmville.

2056
02:25:02,839 --> 02:25:05,062
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll say, I want to do a farming game that's cool.

2057
02:25:05,683 --> 02:25:06,824
[SPEAKER_04]: Where did you kind of get that idea?

2058
02:25:08,166 --> 02:25:16,236
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it was just random thoughts during the day, and I kind of got down to it because it started off with just three people farming on a farm.

2059
02:25:16,932 --> 02:25:24,942
[SPEAKER_00]: and then I thought they should make money and they should have enemies and they should kill wolves and stuff too.

2060
02:25:25,362 --> 02:25:32,250
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was thinking about keep a spend on the enemy concept and they should have a huge mission to be the best farmers in the world.

2061
02:25:32,390 --> 02:25:34,473
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh cool, so your game does have violence in it.

2062
02:25:35,859 --> 02:25:36,259
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.

2063
02:25:36,359 --> 02:25:37,140
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on board.

2064
02:25:37,220 --> 02:25:39,021
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to hit wolves, not people.

2065
02:25:39,081 --> 02:25:40,521
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't steal people's farms.

2066
02:25:40,541 --> 02:25:42,562
[SPEAKER_00]: You just make them sell out to you.

2067
02:25:43,023 --> 02:25:43,603
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.

2068
02:25:45,004 --> 02:25:47,685
[SPEAKER_00]: By selling your crops for less money than them on purpose.

2069
02:25:47,765 --> 02:25:49,266
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like the Walmart model.

2070
02:25:49,446 --> 02:25:50,746
[SPEAKER_04]: So what are you developing for?

2071
02:25:50,766 --> 02:25:53,088
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you developing for Facebook or iOS or what?

2072
02:25:54,248 --> 02:25:55,929
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's going to be for the big three.

2073
02:25:57,595 --> 02:25:58,716
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not LeBron James.

2074
02:25:58,756 --> 02:26:02,339
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be for Mac, Windows, and Linux.

2075
02:26:02,960 --> 02:26:07,103
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, okay, so you're going for not the big three consoles, but the big three computers.

2076
02:26:07,183 --> 02:26:08,785
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, I'm down Mac, PC, Linux.

2077
02:26:09,766 --> 02:26:12,008
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe you will be in the next Humble Indie Bundle.

2078
02:26:13,989 --> 02:26:18,753
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope so, but I need to keep developing, especially the graphics, because...

2079
02:26:20,242 --> 02:26:22,023
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have much backgrounds.

2080
02:26:22,043 --> 02:26:24,385
[SPEAKER_00]: I just have like skies and trees in the background.

2081
02:26:24,605 --> 02:26:24,865
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2082
02:26:25,366 --> 02:26:27,507
[SPEAKER_04]: Where's a website we can keep tabs on your progress?

2083
02:26:27,527 --> 02:26:31,190
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have like a blog or something or at least a Twitter where we can keep tabs on your progress?

2084
02:26:32,150 --> 02:26:34,752
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to type it on the chat so you can like see it.

2085
02:26:34,932 --> 02:26:35,152
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

2086
02:26:35,212 --> 02:26:35,593
[SPEAKER_00]: That works.

2087
02:26:35,873 --> 02:26:37,374
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Tailware.com.

2088
02:26:37,734 --> 02:26:37,994
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

2089
02:26:38,735 --> 02:26:39,395
[SPEAKER_04]: Tailware.com.

2090
02:26:39,415 --> 02:26:40,256
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll look for that in the chat room.

2091
02:26:41,533 --> 02:26:47,097
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so on the side, it's utter crap on there.

2092
02:26:47,317 --> 02:26:49,919
[SPEAKER_04]: But it'll get better as the game gets further along.

2093
02:26:50,840 --> 02:26:57,344
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really bad demo up already, but that's like a really, really old and bad demo up.

2094
02:26:58,245 --> 02:26:59,085
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels so fresh.

2095
02:26:59,185 --> 02:26:59,826
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you the link.

2096
02:27:00,533 --> 02:27:00,973
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

2097
02:27:01,433 --> 02:27:06,235
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, when you get your game finished and you're ready to get it out there, you've got to come back on the show and tell us more about it.

2098
02:27:06,315 --> 02:27:13,297
[SPEAKER_04]: I won't you give away all your ideas yet because you're still developing it, but you've got to come back on the show, maybe with one of your co-developers, and talk a little more about it.

2099
02:27:14,837 --> 02:27:15,978
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, most definitely, you know.

2100
02:27:17,671 --> 02:27:18,292
[SPEAKER_00]: Smurf it up.

2101
02:27:18,612 --> 02:27:20,633
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

2102
02:27:20,693 --> 02:27:21,914
[SPEAKER_04]: La la la la la la.

2103
02:27:22,014 --> 02:27:22,354
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

2104
02:27:23,055 --> 02:27:24,976
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to let you go so we can get more calls.

2105
02:27:24,996 --> 02:27:25,557
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for the call.

2106
02:27:26,757 --> 02:27:29,479
[SPEAKER_04]: Take care, buddy.

2107
02:27:29,679 --> 02:27:31,341
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge Radio on Skype if you want to call us.

2108
02:27:31,401 --> 02:27:33,622
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, tonight the 800 number does not work.

2109
02:27:34,163 --> 02:27:35,403
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we didn't forget to pay the bill.

2110
02:27:36,304 --> 02:27:39,766
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some other issues going on so we will be back with that next week.

2111
02:27:39,967 --> 02:27:41,588
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge Radio on Skype if you want to give us a call.

2112
02:27:43,189 --> 02:27:46,011
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on to more tweets.

2113
02:27:47,095 --> 02:27:50,284
[SPEAKER_04]: Osfer tweeted us saying, Hi guys, guess who's in Disney World?

2114
02:27:51,367 --> 02:27:51,969
[SPEAKER_05]: You suck.

2115
02:27:51,989 --> 02:27:52,570
[SPEAKER_05]: Your mom.

2116
02:27:52,731 --> 02:27:53,333
[SPEAKER_04]: You suck.

2117
02:27:54,841 --> 02:28:01,005
[SPEAKER_04]: S2100 Matt tweets us saying July 2011 was apparently the worst month for the video game industry in almost five years.

2118
02:28:01,526 --> 02:28:06,549
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I read this story too and it has a lot of people going, oh shit, the video game industry is in trouble.

2119
02:28:06,609 --> 02:28:10,051
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm like, well, what games came out in July 2011?

2120
02:28:11,032 --> 02:28:11,592
[SPEAKER_04]: Catherine.

2121
02:28:11,973 --> 02:28:18,457
[SPEAKER_04]: When Catherine is your biggest release like all month, like I'm sorry, no disrespect to Catherine, but it's not exactly a AAA title.

2122
02:28:18,537 --> 02:28:20,859
[SPEAKER_06]: Or disrespect to Earth Defense Force Inside Armageddon.

2123
02:28:21,659 --> 02:28:22,100
[SPEAKER_04]: Excuse me, Loki?

2124
02:28:22,120 --> 02:28:22,520
[SPEAKER_04]: Excuse me, Loki?

2125
02:28:53,590 --> 02:28:56,352
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I said, it's no surprise that it was a weak month.

2126
02:28:56,372 --> 02:28:58,653
[SPEAKER_02]: I demand an explanation for these shenanigans.

2127
02:28:58,934 --> 02:29:03,317
[SPEAKER_04]: Plus the 3DS really doesn't have a lot going for it right now, nor does the PSP.

2128
02:29:03,757 --> 02:29:06,399
[SPEAKER_04]: We're kind of in between a lot of consoles right now.

2129
02:29:06,439 --> 02:29:13,323
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, granted the 360 and PS3 are still kind of at their prime, but those systems don't have fucking anything until the holidays.

2130
02:29:13,904 --> 02:29:15,405
[SPEAKER_04]: Except Catherine.

2131
02:29:16,625 --> 02:29:17,246
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, anyhow.

2132
02:29:18,379 --> 02:29:22,002
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on to MNZiba tweets us saying, I downloaded Jukebeat.

2133
02:29:22,322 --> 02:29:24,964
[SPEAKER_04]: The Contra song on Extreme is hilarious.

2134
02:29:25,384 --> 02:29:26,986
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you supposed to beat that?

2135
02:29:27,346 --> 02:29:28,667
[SPEAKER_04]: You literally have to memorize it.

2136
02:29:28,687 --> 02:29:33,350
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to have to memorize where all those little fuckers show up and know exactly where to tap.

2137
02:29:33,391 --> 02:29:35,032
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you tried a song on Expert yet, Loki?

2138
02:29:35,072 --> 02:29:35,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Just out of curiosity.

2139
02:29:36,053 --> 02:29:36,893
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't even tried.

2140
02:29:36,953 --> 02:29:39,075
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure it's pretty hilarious.

2141
02:29:41,231 --> 02:29:43,413
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2142
02:29:43,893 --> 02:29:48,896
[SPEAKER_04]: Zether tweets us saying, Loki could learn from reason number one on this.

2143
02:29:49,457 --> 02:29:53,299
[SPEAKER_04]: Five crucial lessons learned by watching kids play video games.

2144
02:29:53,879 --> 02:29:56,121
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess, Loki, you could learn from number one.

2145
02:29:56,161 --> 02:29:57,662
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let's recap.

2146
02:29:57,682 --> 02:29:58,823
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a cracked article.

2147
02:29:59,883 --> 02:30:02,424
[SPEAKER_04]: All they do are like top 10 lists, huh?

2148
02:30:02,504 --> 02:30:05,625
[SPEAKER_04]: Like every time I get linked to some top 10 lists, it's all fucking cracked.

2149
02:30:05,945 --> 02:30:10,586
[SPEAKER_04]: Like they've made a website out of top lists.

2150
02:30:11,367 --> 02:30:13,067
[SPEAKER_04]: Not top lists, but top lists.

2151
02:30:13,547 --> 02:30:14,508
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of interesting, I don't know.

2152
02:30:16,408 --> 02:30:20,049
[SPEAKER_04]: Five crucial lessons learned by watching kids play video games.

2153
02:30:20,109 --> 02:30:25,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Number five, they don't tolerate losing, so modern games just let them win.

2154
02:30:26,931 --> 02:30:29,072
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't tolerate losing, so modern games just hand it to them.

2155
02:30:31,176 --> 02:30:33,859
[SPEAKER_04]: Number four, they have no tolerance for grinding.

2156
02:30:34,759 --> 02:30:36,501
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like in an old school Final Fantasy game.

2157
02:30:37,201 --> 02:30:40,184
[SPEAKER_04]: Number three, if they want to read, they'll buy a fucking book.

2158
02:30:42,666 --> 02:30:45,589
[SPEAKER_04]: That might be referencing how I always like to skip to quest text in WoW.

2159
02:30:45,669 --> 02:30:45,989
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

2160
02:30:46,950 --> 02:30:50,573
[SPEAKER_04]: Number two, they press Y to skip as fast as they can.

2161
02:30:51,634 --> 02:30:53,536
[SPEAKER_04]: And number one, Loki, you could learn from this.

2162
02:30:54,659 --> 02:30:55,379
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't like it?

2163
02:30:55,939 --> 02:30:56,380
[SPEAKER_04]: Break it!

2164
02:31:18,906 --> 02:31:26,550
[SPEAKER_06]: versus people like me that just want to play a really fun game with some weapons that necessarily weren't in the stock version of the game.

2165
02:31:28,522 --> 02:31:50,139
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, last tweet tonight from Fydelt61 on Twitter Tweets us, Final Fantasy things, fucking want And it's a tweet to a clock here And maybe I'll have to get DarkSakura to reblog this on the Tumblr So you guys can see this too It is a clock that is made up of Final Fantasy logos So like Final Fantasy 12 is at the top And then 1, 2, 3, get it?

2166
02:31:50,560 --> 02:31:54,823
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's all the different Final Fantasy logos in a clock Send me that and I'll put it on our thing

2167
02:31:54,983 --> 02:32:00,847
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, I will send you that link right now so you can reblog that so listeners can see it.

2168
02:32:00,887 --> 02:32:04,389
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, that came to us from 5delt61 on Twitter.

2169
02:32:05,230 --> 02:32:09,073
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you want to send us stuff to cross post, you can send us stuff on Twitter as well.

2170
02:32:10,634 --> 02:32:14,156
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess not having the 800 number tonight just killed us on calls.

2171
02:32:14,776 --> 02:32:16,718
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to go ahead and close up the Skype line.

2172
02:32:17,138 --> 02:32:17,799
[SPEAKER_04]: That's too bad.

2173
02:32:17,899 --> 02:32:24,243
[SPEAKER_04]: But then again, it has been kind of a slower week and there's not a lot of new games that people are excited to talk about and so forth.

2174
02:32:24,611 --> 02:32:28,375
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to close on up the Skype line and cover any last minute stories.

2175
02:32:28,395 --> 02:32:30,698
[SPEAKER_04]: See if Loki has any last minute stories he wants to talk about real quick.

2176
02:32:30,758 --> 02:32:33,441
[SPEAKER_06]: Just one that I think is kind of funny and ironic.

2177
02:32:34,162 --> 02:32:37,206
[SPEAKER_06]: Facebook has decided that they're changing their game service.

2178
02:32:41,633 --> 02:32:46,898
[SPEAKER_06]: They're actually going to be updating things a little bit.

2179
02:32:47,198 --> 02:33:01,890
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess they said that game growth has slowed and because of that they're starting to tweak things around so they're going to have some sort of looks like a games tab or something like that and different sorting options.

2180
02:33:05,213 --> 02:33:05,693
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

2181
02:33:06,994 --> 02:33:07,114
[SPEAKER_06]: And

2182
02:33:09,079 --> 02:33:13,041
[SPEAKER_04]: I love how they announced a lot of this the same day that Google Games came out.

2183
02:33:13,081 --> 02:33:13,181
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

2184
02:33:13,761 --> 02:33:19,504
[SPEAKER_06]: They reopened Ferility, I guess, is what they were promising.

2185
02:33:20,344 --> 02:33:27,047
[SPEAKER_06]: It basically looks like they're ripping off a bunch of ideas that Google Plus had.

2186
02:33:28,768 --> 02:33:30,909
[SPEAKER_04]: But, of course, these have been in development for a long time.

2187
02:33:31,229 --> 02:33:31,989
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

2188
02:33:32,029 --> 02:33:34,811
[SPEAKER_06]: They've been in development for 6 to 12 months.

2189
02:33:34,891 --> 02:33:35,191
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course.

2190
02:33:37,552 --> 02:33:37,892
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else?

2191
02:33:38,995 --> 02:34:06,637
[SPEAKER_04]: that's it alright well that brings us to the close of another week here at Orange Lounge Radio we will be back next week we will be off in two weeks but we'll be here next week we've been asked about a marathon show this year on Labor Day weekend I kinda don't think that's gonna happen this year just because there's a lot going on around that time however we're gonna look at targeting another three day weekend in the future so don't be too disappointed

2192
02:34:06,937 --> 02:34:11,266
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to do not just a marathon show, but we want to do a marathon that has a little more oomph this year.

2193
02:34:11,666 --> 02:34:15,193
[SPEAKER_04]: So what better time to do it than kicking off the 10th year of Orange Lounge Radio.

2194
02:34:15,554 --> 02:34:16,957
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll be looking at that in the future.

2195
02:34:17,598 --> 02:34:18,039
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, Jamie?

2196
02:34:18,059 --> 02:34:19,121
[SPEAKER_01]: Oui.

2197
02:34:19,673 --> 02:34:26,175
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so anyhow, let's go around and get everybody's final thought Loki, we'll start with you, do you have any final thought tonight?

2198
02:34:28,335 --> 02:34:45,480
[SPEAKER_06]: My final thought is I'm hopefully going to be able to play some more games this week I had plans on doing that this weekend, but that kind of fell through My final thought tonight is I'm looking forward to having some Pinkberry, yay DarkSakura, your final thought tonight?

2199
02:34:45,856 --> 02:34:48,180
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to read exactly what's on macro memory now.

2200
02:34:49,101 --> 02:34:51,385
[SPEAKER_02]: 50 Cent got shot and still whines about it on stage.

2201
02:34:51,766 --> 02:34:55,452
[SPEAKER_02]: Teddy Roosevelt got shot mid-speech and didn't leave the stage until he was finished.

2202
02:34:58,948 --> 02:34:59,428
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

2203
02:34:59,448 --> 02:35:02,169
[SPEAKER_04]: 50 Cent got shot on stage?

2204
02:35:02,229 --> 02:35:02,569
[SPEAKER_04]: I had no idea.

2205
02:35:02,589 --> 02:35:03,389
[SPEAKER_02]: No, he got shot.

2206
02:35:03,429 --> 02:35:04,289
[SPEAKER_02]: He just whines about it.

2207
02:35:04,730 --> 02:35:07,670
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, if somebody shot me, I'd whine.

2208
02:35:08,611 --> 02:35:11,952
[SPEAKER_02]: But Teddy Roosevelt got shot and finished his damn speech.

2209
02:35:12,012 --> 02:35:14,232
[SPEAKER_04]: Still, if I got shot, I'd be whining about it.

2210
02:35:14,632 --> 02:35:14,932
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2211
02:35:16,433 --> 02:35:17,293
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's for another week.

2212
02:35:17,593 --> 02:35:17,993
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, no.

2213
02:35:18,113 --> 02:35:19,694
[SPEAKER_04]: I should never be shot, actually, on the show.

2214
02:35:19,734 --> 02:35:20,354
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be bad.

2215
02:35:20,734 --> 02:35:21,274
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, that's it.

2216
02:35:21,314 --> 02:35:21,655
[SPEAKER_04]: We're out.

2217
02:35:21,955 --> 02:35:22,915
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a wonderful night, everybody.

2218
02:35:22,935 --> 02:35:24,676
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be back here next week to do it all again.

2219
02:35:24,996 --> 02:35:29,539
[SPEAKER_04]: Hope to see you here live Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at All Games Radio.

2220
02:35:29,919 --> 02:35:31,540
[SPEAKER_04]: Until then, we'll see you next time.

2221
02:35:31,660 --> 02:35:32,320
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for listening.

2222
02:35:32,580 --> 02:35:33,941
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell a friend about the show if you enjoyed.

2223
02:35:34,741 --> 02:35:35,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Spread the word at Orange Launch Radio.

2224
02:35:35,862 --> 02:35:39,724
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't have advertising dollars, so therefore we don't stick the show full of ads.

2225
02:35:40,044 --> 02:35:40,984
[SPEAKER_04]: All we ask, word of mouth.

2226
02:35:41,125 --> 02:35:41,505
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a good night.

2227
02:35:42,225 --> 02:35:44,947
[SPEAKER_03]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
