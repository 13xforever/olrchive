[SPEAKER_09]: Sky, and Loki.

[SPEAKER_09]: Tonight, August 21st, 2011, the PlayStation 3 price is cut, the Vita promises to deliver many popular social apps, and are Japanese retailers losing interest in the Xbox 360?

3
00:00:31,752 --> 00:00:37,055

[SPEAKER_10]: What?

9
00:00:54,944 --> 00:00:55,444
[SPEAKER_08]: Philodo.

10
00:00:55,505 --> 00:00:56,065
[SPEAKER_10]: Speak English.

11
00:00:56,625 --> 00:00:56,925
[SPEAKER_08]: I am.

12
00:00:57,146 --> 00:00:58,266
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's kind of, it's Greek.

13
00:00:58,567 --> 00:01:00,468
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm having spinach pie.

14
00:01:01,009 --> 00:01:01,769
[SPEAKER_08]: Spinach pie.

15
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:03,751
[SPEAKER_08]: Like spanakopita, only big.

16
00:01:04,732 --> 00:01:05,652
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, it sounds good.

17
00:01:06,073 --> 00:01:06,473
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Greek.

18
00:01:07,254 --> 00:01:07,714
[SPEAKER_08]: There's plenty.

19
00:01:09,115 --> 00:01:11,097
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just know feta cheese.

20
00:01:11,117 --> 00:01:11,797
[SPEAKER_10]: That's Greek, too.

21
00:01:11,897 --> 00:01:13,459
[SPEAKER_10]: And the olives, they're really good.

22
00:01:13,499 --> 00:01:13,739
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

23
00:01:14,119 --> 00:01:17,842
[SPEAKER_10]: Also say hello to, I'm ignorant, say hello to Tech Master Loki.

24
00:01:17,922 --> 00:01:18,903
[SPEAKER_02]: What she meant to say is, Philodo!

25
00:01:18,923 --> 00:01:19,563
[SPEAKER_10]: Philodo!

26
00:01:21,857 --> 00:01:24,558
[SPEAKER_02]: Secret ingredient is phyllo dough!

27
00:01:26,059 --> 00:01:28,180
[SPEAKER_10]: Just doing a speaker check, everybody out there.

28
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:33,162
[SPEAKER_10]: Make sure your levels are Loki appropriate tonight for him to scream in the microphone.

29
00:01:33,462 --> 00:01:34,142
[SPEAKER_10]: How you doing, Loki?

30
00:01:34,322 --> 00:01:34,783
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm doing fine.

31
00:01:35,083 --> 00:01:35,383
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome.

32
00:01:35,788 --> 00:01:48,873
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, always present with us, the chat room, the fourth guest on the program, chat.orangeloungeradio.com if you want to join us on this Sunday night with us as we are taping episode number 425 of our show live.

33
00:01:49,513 --> 00:01:52,054
[SPEAKER_10]: So I don't know about you guys, I've had a pretty busy day.

34
00:01:52,194 --> 00:01:57,736
[SPEAKER_10]: I was on another podcast this morning for a good, God, it probably went for about two, two and a half hours, but it was a good show.

35
00:01:57,756 --> 00:01:58,076
[SPEAKER_10]: Isn't it fun?

36
00:01:58,436 --> 00:01:58,996
[SPEAKER_10]: It was fun.

37
00:01:59,016 --> 00:02:04,080
[SPEAKER_10]: I was hanging with my sassy British friends on the Girls Gone Wow podcast, which I know is funny because I'm not a girl.

38
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,681
[SPEAKER_10]: But it doesn't matter.

39
00:02:06,022 --> 00:02:06,922
[SPEAKER_10]: It's still a good time.

40
00:02:07,242 --> 00:02:10,405
[SPEAKER_10]: And the girls that are on the show are very fun.

41
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:12,826
[SPEAKER_08]: They took my suggestion and called you Sky and called him Rob?

42
00:02:13,027 --> 00:02:13,687
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, they did.

43
00:02:13,727 --> 00:02:14,047
[SPEAKER_10]: They did.

44
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:15,608
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't know that was your suggestion.

45
00:02:15,809 --> 00:02:16,209
[SPEAKER_10]: Good for you.

46
00:02:16,689 --> 00:02:18,050
[SPEAKER_10]: So anyway, yeah, I was doing that this morning.

47
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:19,291
[SPEAKER_10]: So a cheap plug for them.

48
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:19,831
[SPEAKER_10]: That works.

49
00:02:20,292 --> 00:02:26,276
[SPEAKER_10]: And yeah, before we get into Gaming Weeks, I want to talk about this because this is something I was kind of doing this weekend as well.

50
00:02:26,516 --> 00:02:26,636
[SPEAKER_10]: And...

51
00:02:27,698 --> 00:02:33,758
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I haven't mentioned this on Twitter and I haven't really talked about this anywhere because I wanted to just kind of start off tonight's show talking about this, but...

52
00:02:34,708 --> 00:02:36,309
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

53
00:03:01,127 --> 00:03:03,049
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to be totally just blunt and honest.

54
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,832
[SPEAKER_10]: I read that article on Joystick.com.

55
00:03:06,252 --> 00:03:09,776
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know how many of you guys saw this, but Joystick ran an article a couple days ago.

56
00:03:09,816 --> 00:03:10,136
[SPEAKER_10]: You know them.

57
00:03:10,156 --> 00:03:11,918
[SPEAKER_10]: They're a very big gaming blog.

58
00:03:11,938 --> 00:03:12,699
[SPEAKER_10]: They have their own show.

59
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:13,620
[SPEAKER_10]: It's huge on iTunes.

60
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,801
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure many of you subscribe.

61
00:03:15,382 --> 00:03:21,409
[SPEAKER_10]: As far as the more corporate blogs go, I guess you could say they're definitely one of the better ones.

62
00:03:22,109 --> 00:03:36,377
[SPEAKER_10]: and it's because of interesting things like this that they do that make them stand out and they ran an article Thursday or Friday about Xenoblade coming out in Europe and the article was basically how to play Xenoblade on a US Wii

63
00:03:37,177 --> 00:03:59,726
[SPEAKER_10]: and it basically was here is what you need to download here is how you hack your console and here's where you buy your import copy of Xenoblade so you can play it on the Wii and I have to admit a lot of what was holding me back before to hacking my console was it seemed kind of complicated like I know Loki was always doing all that stuff but you know Loki and we've talked about this on the show before Loki breaks shit because he can't that's

64
00:04:00,146 --> 00:04:03,209
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes I break shit when I don't want to break shit, but it happens.

65
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:04,711
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just part of the process.

66
00:04:15,362 --> 00:04:36,054
[SPEAKER_10]: so I mean it looks lengthy but it looks easy so I followed it step by step and I did it it was it was pretty easy and I gotta admit it was kind of neat seeing like all the you know because when you're doing some of this stuff you basically are booting your Wii like it's a PC and so it has kind of like that old school IBM PC font and you see all these programs that are running in that and so forth and

67
00:04:37,035 --> 00:04:38,115
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Linux loaders.

68
00:04:39,076 --> 00:04:40,517
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't even know what the hell's going on.

69
00:04:40,557 --> 00:04:42,579
[SPEAKER_10]: I just kind of followed all the instructions and there you go.

70
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:45,561
[SPEAKER_10]: So now if I want to import Xenoblade, I can.

71
00:04:46,802 --> 00:04:49,164
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know how I feel about that right now.

72
00:04:49,484 --> 00:04:52,346
[SPEAKER_10]: I really, really do not like Xenoblade.

73
00:04:52,466 --> 00:04:53,446
[SPEAKER_10]: This whole region.

74
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:55,007
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't like region locking.

75
00:04:55,387 --> 00:04:58,828
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't like the fact that some games come out in one region and don't come out in the other.

76
00:04:59,388 --> 00:05:01,248
[SPEAKER_10]: I love so much more what Sony's doing.

77
00:05:01,728 --> 00:05:06,829
[SPEAKER_10]: And maybe I think that was part of my big motivator was that I just wanted to make my Wii region free.

78
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:15,031
[SPEAKER_10]: And now I can check out some of this other cool shit about like what custom Mario Kart Wii and so forth.

79
00:05:15,271 --> 00:05:15,992
[SPEAKER_02]: And what?

80
00:05:16,092 --> 00:05:17,292
[SPEAKER_02]: You can play President Cat.

81
00:05:18,593 --> 00:05:20,714
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I could play President Cat.

82
00:05:20,794 --> 00:05:25,237
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't even think of that, but that's a damn good reason for me to have done what I did to my Wii.

83
00:05:25,437 --> 00:05:27,679
[SPEAKER_10]: If there's any game worth importing, it's that one.

84
00:05:27,739 --> 00:05:29,400
[SPEAKER_10]: If I could even find a copy anymore.

85
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:30,721
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a copy.

86
00:05:30,841 --> 00:05:31,121
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

87
00:05:31,301 --> 00:05:32,242
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

88
00:05:32,463 --> 00:05:34,004
[SPEAKER_10]: I would like to borrow President Cat.

89
00:05:34,345 --> 00:05:35,746
[SPEAKER_02]: I bought a copy of President Cat.

90
00:05:36,006 --> 00:05:38,769
[SPEAKER_02]: Played it once and it sits in the shelf somewhere.

91
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:40,571
[SPEAKER_10]: I knew there was a good reason I did this.

92
00:05:41,732 --> 00:05:46,417
[SPEAKER_10]: And I realize some folks out there that are very anti-hacking and all that are like, Rob, how could you?

93
00:05:46,858 --> 00:05:48,800
[SPEAKER_10]: You've been the voice of reason on the show for so long.

94
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,480
[SPEAKER_10]: How could you do this?

95
00:05:49,821 --> 00:05:52,624
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, if you want to know how he could do it, the instructions were on Joystick.

96
00:05:54,465 --> 00:06:09,820
[SPEAKER_10]: at the end of the day yes that's exactly right somebody wrote an article like how to do this for dummies and I was like alright I can do it and I did it and in some ways I realized I was taking a risk with my Wii console that you know I might break it or something like that

97
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,061
[SPEAKER_10]: You're such a naughty boy.

98
00:06:13,121 --> 00:06:13,681
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I didn't...

99
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:34,106
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

100
00:06:43,854 --> 00:07:10,400
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's interesting that I could use the USB loader to like load up my games onto one drive but I don't know I don't know if I'll really do that because I honestly think it's just easier to just get the damn disc and put it in the Wii if I'm actually gonna play any of those games let's face it many of which I don't anymore once in a blue blue moon I'll decide there's something on the Wii I want to play usually it's a virtual console game to be honest so there you go

101
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:19,487
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, what do you think of, now I gotta ask this question, what do you think of the fact that a big blog like Joystick did this?

102
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:23,130
[SPEAKER_10]: Because clearly they did it to make a statement, like at least that's what I read out of it.

103
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:30,396
[SPEAKER_10]: They did it to make a statement that Nintendo, by not releasing Xenoblade in the US, you leave us no other choice.

104
00:07:30,796 --> 00:07:38,382
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they've run an article similar to that before anyways, and I know they've done it before with the PSP, so, nah, I'm not surprised.

105
00:07:40,290 --> 00:08:09,991
[SPEAKER_10]: hmm what do you think DarkSakura what do you think of a website like that kind of you know a prestigious if we will gaming website they're kind of doing that they're gonna get a cease and desist from Nintendo and then take the article down but the damage has been done their protest has been made do you think that they made a statement or do you think that they look kind of you know and I'm not I'm not asking this to open any channel of disrespecting what they did but let's see look statemently to me you know yeah I think they did and well done

106
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:16,713
[SPEAKER_10]: So now here's the other interesting thing about this whole Xenoblade and the last story in this whole saga.

107
00:08:17,294 --> 00:08:23,098
[SPEAKER_10]: My gut still tells me we've got PAX coming this weekend and there's going to be a lot of news that comes out of PAX.

108
00:08:23,658 --> 00:08:28,481
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that usually you don't have a lot of big, big announcements coming out of PAX.

109
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:30,342
[SPEAKER_10]: Like usually that's what E3 is for.

110
00:08:30,863 --> 00:08:34,045
[SPEAKER_10]: Gamescom usually ends up being a pretty similar show to PAX.

111
00:08:34,645 --> 00:08:37,267
[SPEAKER_10]: However, PAX has been getting bigger and bigger.

112
00:08:37,727 --> 00:08:38,968
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been a sellout show.

113
00:08:39,328 --> 00:08:41,430
[SPEAKER_10]: I think you do see companies making more and more announcements.

114
00:08:41,994 --> 00:08:46,659
[SPEAKER_10]: and honestly in my mind, what better time to announce Xenoblade?

115
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:52,686
[SPEAKER_10]: I honestly think if Nintendo does not announce Xenoblade at PAX next week, they're not going to.

116
00:08:54,231 --> 00:09:13,753
[SPEAKER_10]: I think next week is really the last quote-unquote last chance I mean granted they can hold a press conference whenever they want and say whatever they want but as far as a celebration if you will of the fans next week is the chance for them to do that Nintendo is in Seattle they're in the backyard of Seattle it's not a problem for them to do packs and they do go I think every year

117
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:14,494
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think so.

118
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:41,506
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not so sure if Nintendo's doing PAX that they're going to bring the Wii U. And the reason why is that the Wii U did not get a huge reception at E3.

119
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:44,748
[SPEAKER_10]: And so they might have taken things back to the drawing board.

120
00:09:44,788 --> 00:09:46,709
[SPEAKER_10]: They may not be ready to show that to the public.

121
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:52,493
[SPEAKER_10]: If Nintendo's going to E3, or excuse me, if Nintendo's going to PAX, they're going to be showing off the 3DS.

122
00:09:52,613 --> 00:09:53,354
[SPEAKER_10]: That's for sure.

123
00:09:53,394 --> 00:09:54,275
[SPEAKER_10]: That'll be their huge thing.

124
00:09:54,355 --> 00:09:59,798
[SPEAKER_10]: Their huge push will be the Mario game, the Mario Kart, and the 3DS price cut.

125
00:09:59,858 --> 00:10:02,460
[SPEAKER_10]: That is going to be the majority of what they're pushing.

126
00:10:03,521 --> 00:10:10,245
[SPEAKER_10]: but they do have a handful of titles coming out on the Wii this holiday season like what Rhythm Heaven there's another Kirby game right?

127
00:10:10,365 --> 00:10:30,558
[SPEAKER_10]: it's on it's way so there's a few things that Nintendo kind of still has going on and what a perfect time for them to say oh yeah and over here on these kiosks we have hey American Xenoblade I really think the push is going to be more of the 3DS obviously because they just dropped the system down in price they've really kicked up the advertising for it I don't know if you've seen the ads about you know

128
00:10:31,198 --> 00:10:35,604
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically highlighting the three big games from Star Fox, Mario, Mario Kart.

129
00:10:38,428 --> 00:10:39,530
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're definitely pushing.

130
00:10:41,809 --> 00:10:49,972
[SPEAKER_10]: So going to the chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com, BlackWolf is in chat saying, Nintendo won't bring the Wii U because they only showed it at E3 to stop leaks.

131
00:10:50,052 --> 00:10:54,654
[SPEAKER_10]: And see, I'm kind of inclined to agree is that maybe not totally the reason why.

132
00:10:54,694 --> 00:11:03,877
[SPEAKER_10]: I think part of the reason why, I think if the Wii U had had a huge, oh my gosh, everybody's got to do this, and hold this whole huge reception at E3, I think they would have had a little bit of it at PAX.

133
00:11:04,617 --> 00:11:31,970
[SPEAKER_10]: but also keep in mind that the PAX booths are a lot smaller than the E3 booths and they don't always have as much space to show everything and if they were to bring the Wii U they would have those huge lines that go with it I just don't think now is the time for them to be pushing the Wii U next year's PAX maybe because we could be looking at the Wii U for next holiday but I just think this year's PAX is going to be all about the 3DS and maybe just maybe Xenoblade

134
00:11:33,847 --> 00:11:36,808
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm actually entirely inclined to agree with that.

135
00:11:38,328 --> 00:11:41,689
[SPEAKER_10]: And SSJ100Matt is confirming for me that Nintendo is going to be at PAX.

136
00:11:41,709 --> 00:11:42,189
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.

137
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:50,032
[SPEAKER_10]: UnfoldedRaptor is in our chatroom saying, Sky, the last story, another big RPG for the Wii, is getting localized for Europe but not for America.

138
00:11:50,452 --> 00:11:52,772
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we'll see this whole situation again in the future.

139
00:11:52,852 --> 00:11:53,553
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, absolutely.

140
00:11:53,793 --> 00:11:54,253
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely.

141
00:11:54,893 --> 00:11:59,176
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this is, the last story is still part of that, whatever that campaign, yeah.

142
00:11:59,256 --> 00:12:03,659
[SPEAKER_10]: But otherwise, the games actually, I mean, they're both RPGs, but that's kind of where the similarities end.

143
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:12,526
[SPEAKER_10]: The huge thing about the last story is it's Mistwalker, meaning, like, Nobe Uematsu did the music, the guy that did the Final Fantasy, the original, is behind this.

144
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:15,228
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, Mistwalker games are usually a pretty big deal.

145
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:17,089
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, well, I don't...

146
00:12:17,389 --> 00:12:17,910
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

147
00:12:35,532 --> 00:12:36,232
[SPEAKER_10]: Gang fight, gang fight

148
00:13:03,178 --> 00:13:04,079
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

149
00:13:04,499 --> 00:13:18,810
[SPEAKER_10]: Our little dog and pony podcast does not get quite the amount of viewers that Joystick does, so I'm not sure what kind of happens when you're that big, if you can get away with more things like that without getting blacklisted or what have you.

150
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:23,934
[SPEAKER_10]: But I do seem to remember some time ago, Kotaku did something to piss Sony off.

151
00:13:24,674 --> 00:13:45,240
[SPEAKER_10]: and they're another big blog and they got blacklisted for a little while but it was well when I say a little while it was literally like 48 hours or something something was quickly remedied there so you know a blog that big has a lot of pull I gotta say so I don't think Nintendo could just straight up blacklist them but you know there's there's things Nintendo could do if they want so

152
00:13:45,748 --> 00:13:47,529
[SPEAKER_08]: They could stomp their little foot and pout.

153
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:53,174
[SPEAKER_10]: Black Wolf is being a party pooper saying the last story soundtrack actually was done by Yoshitaka Suzuki.

154
00:13:53,214 --> 00:13:54,435
[SPEAKER_10]: It was not done by Nobuo Imatsu.

155
00:13:54,715 --> 00:13:56,116
[SPEAKER_10]: He didn't even do the theme or anything?

156
00:13:56,156 --> 00:13:58,478
[SPEAKER_10]: That's surprising to me because he's a part of Mistwalker Studios.

157
00:13:58,898 --> 00:14:00,139
[SPEAKER_10]: So, whatever.

158
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:01,440
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.

159
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:19,653
[SPEAKER_10]: uh we're gonna get into how was your gaming week here in just a minute but let me go to another kind of random question that popped up in chat uh from Danish hey guys Mr. Niche here I have a question for OLR from what information you know at this moment would you guys buy the 3DS now or wait for the PlayStation Vita if you could only buy one

160
00:14:21,533 --> 00:14:23,174
[SPEAKER_10]: Hmm.

161
00:14:23,334 --> 00:14:33,622
[SPEAKER_10]: I already own a 3DS, but see, here's where I'm at, is that I kind of think the systems are spaced far enough apart where that if you plan well, you can kind of afford both.

162
00:14:34,143 --> 00:14:34,483
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree.

163
00:14:35,964 --> 00:14:42,990
[SPEAKER_10]: But if you're very adamant, like, no, I only have X amount, and I understand there's students and people on fixed budgets that can only afford one or the other.

164
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:47,554
[SPEAKER_10]: It's really hard right now for me to say, yeah, go for the Vita.

165
00:14:48,134 --> 00:14:53,760
[SPEAKER_10]: Because for the Vita right now, we have a lot of announcements and we have a lot of ideas for games.

166
00:14:54,180 --> 00:15:01,827
[SPEAKER_10]: But now that the Vita is not launching until 2012, there's a part of me that wonders if it's not going to have a very similar situation to what the 3DS had.

167
00:15:01,947 --> 00:15:06,051
[SPEAKER_10]: Meaning, yeah, it's going to launch in March, but there's not going to be any really good launch games.

168
00:15:06,371 --> 00:15:08,853
[SPEAKER_10]: And then everything you really want will be out at the holidays.

169
00:15:09,654 --> 00:15:23,827
[SPEAKER_10]: so part of me says if you think you could have enough money this holiday and then again next holiday I think you're safe to get a 3DS right now and then get a Vita later otherwise it really depends on what games you want to play because if you want to play Uncharted

170
00:15:24,868 --> 00:15:53,472
[SPEAKER_10]: 3DS doesn't have anything like that right now so clearly you need to get a Vita but if you want to play Mario the Vita doesn't have anything like that right now so you need to get a 3DS so I don't have an easy answer it really depends on what games do you want to play because that's the only thing that's setting the two systems apart right now if you think about it this way the two systems don't have any games in common it's not like the Xbox and the 360 herp derp the 360 and the Playstation 3 what do they have in common

171
00:15:53,971 --> 00:15:57,457
[SPEAKER_10]: They might have some franchises that get one game here and one game here.

172
00:15:57,838 --> 00:15:59,962
[SPEAKER_10]: But what games do the two both have?

173
00:16:00,523 --> 00:16:02,466
[SPEAKER_02]: Lego Harry Potter, yours 5 through 7.

174
00:16:02,707 --> 00:16:04,470
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, excuse me!

175
00:16:05,646 --> 00:16:06,546
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, you said none.

176
00:16:07,947 --> 00:16:10,788
[SPEAKER_10]: I just pissed off a bunch of Harry Potter Lego fans.

177
00:16:10,888 --> 00:16:12,429
[SPEAKER_10]: My bad on that.

178
00:16:12,969 --> 00:16:25,734
[SPEAKER_08]: I will actually say that if it were me, I'm going to get 3DS because I haven't touched our PSP since I was playing Popola Cross.

179
00:16:27,015 --> 00:16:28,495
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I was playing Roku Loko.

180
00:16:28,735 --> 00:16:30,616
[SPEAKER_08]: I was playing something back then, but it was about a year.

181
00:16:31,136 --> 00:16:32,197
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's something else to consider.

182
00:16:34,245 --> 00:16:36,506
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you need that portable device to do other shit for you?

183
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:38,647
[SPEAKER_10]: Meaning, do you need an MP3 player as well?

184
00:16:39,067 --> 00:16:40,768
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you want something to surf the web with?

185
00:16:40,869 --> 00:16:43,630
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, granted, the 3DS does have a web browser, but it's kind of shit.

186
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:44,711
[SPEAKER_10]: Terrible!

187
00:16:46,592 --> 00:16:55,357
[SPEAKER_10]: Where the PSP really succeeded that the original DS or DS Lite, whatever you want to call it, kind of didn't do so well is it, you know, what's PlayStation's little tagline?

188
00:16:55,437 --> 00:16:56,418
[SPEAKER_10]: It only does everything.

189
00:16:56,678 --> 00:17:01,260
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that's kind of true when it comes to PSP versus DS, you know, going back.

190
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:08,542
[SPEAKER_10]: And what I imagine will continue to be the case in Vita versus 3DS is that the PS Vita is going to be able to do this other stuff.

191
00:17:08,562 --> 00:17:14,864
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a story later on tonight about apps that you know from the iPhone are going to be making their way to the Vita.

192
00:17:15,264 --> 00:17:20,006
[SPEAKER_10]: If you don't have an iPhone, so maybe you have a need for this kind of stuff, then the Vita looks more appealing.

193
00:17:20,926 --> 00:17:26,068
[SPEAKER_10]: But if you don't need any of that crap, you don't need Facebook again because maybe you have an Android or something.

194
00:17:26,548 --> 00:17:50,952
[SPEAKER_10]: and maybe you're fine with the 3DS so I know you want me to say one or the other but every gamer is different and it's really about at the end of the day what's the golden rule of gaming a system is only as good as the games that are on it and only you know what games you want to play so speaking of games you want to play let's talk about our gaming weeks and we usually like to start off the show talking about what video games we have been playing so DarkSakura start us off

195
00:17:51,918 --> 00:17:54,019
[SPEAKER_08]: Games I have been and am playing right now.

196
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:55,300
[SPEAKER_08]: Sims 3.

197
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:59,782
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got everything up except for the newest expansion.

198
00:18:00,602 --> 00:18:02,183
[SPEAKER_08]: And I am playing the crap out of it.

199
00:18:03,043 --> 00:18:06,525
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I have been playing World of Warcraft.

200
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,586
[SPEAKER_08]: And I actually got really burned out last night.

201
00:18:09,386 --> 00:18:11,647
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I could not... I played for like five hours.

202
00:18:12,268 --> 00:18:17,230
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I was just sitting here going... I'm going to play my Paladin.

203
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:19,051
[SPEAKER_08]: It takes so long to level when you're in the 70s now.

204
00:18:20,571 --> 00:18:26,053
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's faster than it was with my mage, because hi, everything there is undead, and hi, paladin, holy, whatever.

205
00:18:26,553 --> 00:18:27,453
[SPEAKER_08]: So I've been playing a bunch of that.

206
00:18:28,794 --> 00:18:34,556
[SPEAKER_08]: And I've actually played Robot Unicorn Attack for a little bit today, and Tiny Tower.

207
00:18:35,396 --> 00:18:35,696
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it.

208
00:18:37,353 --> 00:18:37,693
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

209
00:18:37,893 --> 00:18:38,733
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, what have you been up to?

210
00:18:38,773 --> 00:18:40,514
[SPEAKER_10]: You're playing something right now during the show.

211
00:18:40,554 --> 00:18:41,954
[SPEAKER_10]: What is this that you're checking out right now?

212
00:18:42,554 --> 00:18:44,274
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm playing Earth Defense Force Insect Norm again.

213
00:18:44,755 --> 00:18:48,675
[SPEAKER_10]: The minute you paused it and it said, destroy the anthill, I'm like, oh, this must be Earth Defense Force.

214
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:49,035
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

215
00:18:49,636 --> 00:18:52,316
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I've been playing a lot of Earth Defense Force this week.

216
00:18:52,776 --> 00:18:53,576
[SPEAKER_02]: My boss is out of town.

217
00:18:53,636 --> 00:18:57,477
[SPEAKER_02]: Normally, he wants to play Grand Theft Auto during our breaks and lunch and stuff.

218
00:18:58,957 --> 00:19:04,879
[SPEAKER_02]: But since he's gone and our other co-worker's gone, we've only had three people, and so we've been playing Earth Defense Force...

219
00:19:06,599 --> 00:19:26,511
[SPEAKER_02]: All week long and it's been awesome I've leveled up my tactical guy Up to tier 7 Trying to level up to tier 8 now By farming this first level And there's a trick to it And it also involves the rubber band Kind of a cheat I guess So I will be doing that During the show You don't cheat at anything ever

220
00:19:27,652 --> 00:19:28,593
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an exploit.

221
00:19:28,853 --> 00:19:30,234
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not necessarily a cheat.

222
00:19:30,434 --> 00:19:35,417
[SPEAKER_02]: I am not hacking or anything, even though I could have done that, but I did not.

223
00:19:35,657 --> 00:19:37,898
[SPEAKER_02]: So I am leveling up legitimately.

224
00:19:37,918 --> 00:19:41,700
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't feel like holding the trigger down for three hours.

225
00:19:43,261 --> 00:19:45,162
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's where the rubber band comes into play.

226
00:19:45,902 --> 00:19:46,183
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.

227
00:19:47,543 --> 00:19:50,504
[SPEAKER_10]: You do all the cheating you want in single player mode.

228
00:19:50,584 --> 00:19:51,205
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what?

229
00:19:51,485 --> 00:19:54,746
[SPEAKER_10]: If you want to cheat the hell out of it when you're by yourself, then go for it.

230
00:19:54,766 --> 00:19:55,686
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all co-op.

231
00:19:55,706 --> 00:19:56,607
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no cheating.

232
00:19:56,927 --> 00:19:58,167
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no leaderboards.

233
00:19:58,247 --> 00:19:58,827
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing.

234
00:19:59,628 --> 00:20:00,768
[SPEAKER_02]: It's only for my own benefit.

235
00:20:02,809 --> 00:20:11,552
[SPEAKER_02]: The other stuff I've been playing, I played VVVV and I finished the game, but I still have to get some of the shiny objects in there.

236
00:20:11,912 --> 00:20:26,971
[SPEAKER_02]: and that game was really hard and frustratingly hard sometimes but I think that's the point of it and it was fun let's see what else did I play a little bit of Grand Theft Auto and

237
00:20:30,089 --> 00:20:31,170
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's it, actually.

238
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:32,111
[SPEAKER_02]: Just those three.

239
00:20:33,132 --> 00:20:36,996
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think I played... I may have turned Tiny Tower on once.

240
00:20:38,277 --> 00:20:45,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I probably should download the update for that, so I'll probably do that and then maybe build some more empty floors since I can't build anything else.

241
00:20:47,185 --> 00:20:47,285
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

242
00:20:49,287 --> 00:20:49,868
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's it.

243
00:20:50,928 --> 00:20:53,210
[SPEAKER_10]: My gaming week, my Xbox is still out of commission.

244
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:57,333
[SPEAKER_10]: If you haven't heard the story yet, listen to last week's show at the very beginning.

245
00:20:58,013 --> 00:20:59,554
[SPEAKER_10]: So I don't really have any updates on that yet.

246
00:20:59,594 --> 00:21:07,960
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just sitting there collecting dust until that whole debacle's settled down because even though I can play things in single player mode, I don't want to get achievements and stuff.

247
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,221
[SPEAKER_10]: So I don't know.

248
00:21:09,261 --> 00:21:13,884
[SPEAKER_10]: I've just moved on to PlayStation 3, which is what I've been playing mostly in my console gaming time.

249
00:21:14,784 --> 00:21:17,385
[SPEAKER_10]: Not a lot of new stuff for me to talk about on PlayStation 3.

250
00:21:17,425 --> 00:21:19,305
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been revisiting some of the old stuff.

251
00:21:19,725 --> 00:21:30,267
[SPEAKER_10]: Played Katamari randomly during the week and also was playing a game that I think I briefly talked about before, like last year on the show when it first came out, but it's Hardcore Uprising.

252
00:21:30,768 --> 00:21:34,628
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you don't know what this game is, it's basically Contra, but they didn't call it Contra.

253
00:21:35,008 --> 00:21:41,790
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Hardcore Uprising and what the art is all by Arc System Works and all this, although it's still a Konami game and

254
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:45,011
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's something that Extifer, of all people, got me into.

255
00:21:45,031 --> 00:21:46,652
[SPEAKER_10]: If you guys listen to Horde House, you know Extifer.

256
00:21:46,912 --> 00:21:48,813
[SPEAKER_10]: And he is really into this game right now.

257
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:55,876
[SPEAKER_10]: And when we all went over to his house about a week ago, he was playing it, and I was kind of watching him, and I was like, oh, this actually looks kind of fun.

258
00:21:55,936 --> 00:21:59,598
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, I don't remember feeling this awesome about the game after playing the demo.

259
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:00,771
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

260
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:30,495
[SPEAKER_10]: and in the uprising mode you basically all your points turn out to be a currency and you use these points to upgrade your characters so that the mode can get a little easier and a little easier.

261
00:22:30,595 --> 00:22:40,059
[SPEAKER_10]: Like maybe you can make your life bar a little bit longer or you get yourself a few more lives or your power up will be a little bit stronger next time that you get that power up.

262
00:22:40,519 --> 00:22:55,127
[SPEAKER_10]: so I like being able to progress that way because that way it doesn't feel like you keep banging your head against the wall because you keep dying at the same point you know you know that as long as you keep racking up points you'll be able to get your character more and more powered so you'll be able to get through all that stuff so um

263
00:22:56,127 --> 00:22:58,268
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's the cool thing about Hardcore Uprising.

264
00:22:59,609 --> 00:23:06,111
[SPEAKER_10]: And yeah, if you want the hardcore stuff, though, there's Arcade Mode, where you don't have any of the power-ups, and you just gotta push through.

265
00:23:06,411 --> 00:23:10,913
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was excited that I could beat the first stage without continuing, okay?

266
00:23:11,373 --> 00:23:13,714
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, that was... In the Contra game, that's huge.

267
00:23:13,754 --> 00:23:14,655
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it is huge.

268
00:23:14,695 --> 00:23:15,215
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

269
00:23:15,315 --> 00:23:15,935
[SPEAKER_10]: So there you go.

270
00:23:16,956 --> 00:23:20,057
[SPEAKER_10]: And yeah, Zether's in the chatroom going, Get all the achievements.

271
00:23:20,177 --> 00:23:22,018
[SPEAKER_10]: Try beating it on no-death mode.

272
00:23:23,476 --> 00:23:24,257
[SPEAKER_10]: Good luck with that!

273
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:46,816
[SPEAKER_10]: Zether is also clarifying that it's more of a sequel to the game on the Genesis is where that comes from.

274
00:23:46,836 --> 00:23:47,237
[SPEAKER_10]: Contra Hardcore.

275
00:23:47,577 --> 00:23:48,898
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, Contra Hardcore.

276
00:23:49,598 --> 00:23:50,719
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, I mean, whatever.

277
00:23:50,759 --> 00:23:51,880
[SPEAKER_10]: At the end of the day, it's Contra.

278
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:52,721
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I feel.

279
00:23:52,741 --> 00:23:55,042
[SPEAKER_10]: You have a spread gun, you have all the medals.

280
00:23:55,523 --> 00:23:58,885
[SPEAKER_08]: Contra Hardcore was pretty dang hard.

281
00:23:59,205 --> 00:23:59,386
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

282
00:24:01,147 --> 00:24:01,747
[SPEAKER_10]: So there you go.

283
00:24:01,847 --> 00:24:04,750
[SPEAKER_10]: That was Hardcore Uprising.

284
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:11,855
[SPEAKER_10]: And that was pretty much, other than that, some more PC games, more Civilization V because it's great, and of course World of Warcraft.

285
00:24:12,015 --> 00:24:13,136
[SPEAKER_10]: So that was my gaming week.

286
00:24:13,856 --> 00:24:17,299
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, quickly some housekeeping before we get into the news tonight.

287
00:24:17,719 --> 00:24:20,081
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to quickly say there is no show next Sunday.

288
00:24:20,661 --> 00:24:26,104
[SPEAKER_10]: I do believe another best of is being prepped for the live folks that listen at allgames.com.

289
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:27,144
[SPEAKER_10]: So at least there will be that.

290
00:24:27,465 --> 00:24:29,105
[SPEAKER_10]: But we will not be live next week.

291
00:24:29,586 --> 00:24:33,047
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to be out of town and we're just going to take the week off.

292
00:24:33,067 --> 00:24:34,188
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm helping somebody move.

293
00:24:34,328 --> 00:24:35,909
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been a while since we had a week off.

294
00:24:35,969 --> 00:24:36,489
[SPEAKER_10]: So darn it.

295
00:24:36,569 --> 00:24:37,510
[SPEAKER_10]: Sometimes we take a day off.

296
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:39,070
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're taking next week off.

297
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:40,211
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll be back in two weeks.

298
00:24:40,491 --> 00:24:43,653
[SPEAKER_10]: It is a little bit of a bummer that we're missing next week because it is PAX.

299
00:24:44,213 --> 00:24:59,424
[SPEAKER_10]: but just the timing of everything not really going to work out so my hope is that maybe some of our listeners are going to PAX and they're just not going to be able to tune in because they're flying back or whatever so we'll do a big roundup and everything when we come back on Labor Day weekend we will be having a show so we'll be seeing you guys then.

300
00:25:00,064 --> 00:25:03,506
[SPEAKER_10]: Otherwise, in the meantime, follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.

301
00:25:03,807 --> 00:25:07,089
[SPEAKER_10]: We're also on Facebook at facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

302
00:25:07,689 --> 00:25:11,431
[SPEAKER_10]: And, of course, there's always our website, www.orangeloungeradio.com.

303
00:25:11,451 --> 00:25:12,272
[SPEAKER_10]: There's some forums.

304
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:17,215
[SPEAKER_10]: I noticed that we had a post where some of the things that we weren't sure.

305
00:25:17,255 --> 00:25:23,839
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember how last week we had the email that linked to a DeviantArt account and we weren't sure if we could post the pictures of the Capcom building and all the stuff that we were linked?

306
00:25:24,179 --> 00:25:27,301
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that emailer went and made a post in our forums and was like, oh, I don't care.

307
00:25:27,341 --> 00:25:27,842
[SPEAKER_10]: Here it all is.

308
00:25:28,182 --> 00:25:32,145
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you want to kind of like see that second half to last week's email, it's all there on the forums.

309
00:25:32,565 --> 00:25:34,707
[SPEAKER_10]: So check that out at orange launch radio dot com.

310
00:25:35,247 --> 00:25:35,427
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

311
00:25:35,447 --> 00:25:36,628
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's get into tonight's news.

312
00:25:36,788 --> 00:25:37,729
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, start us off.

313
00:25:37,969 --> 00:25:38,189
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

314
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:40,291
[SPEAKER_02]: So start things off.

315
00:25:40,311 --> 00:25:44,014
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to talk a little bit about PlayStation and.

316
00:25:46,115 --> 00:25:48,497
[SPEAKER_02]: Some interesting stuff came out this week from Gamescom.

317
00:26:04,947 --> 00:26:12,510
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'm sure that's just to kind of pick up the pace for the holiday season because I don't think they've been top dog for the last few months.

318
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:16,431
[SPEAKER_02]: So they kind of have to, I guess, try a little harder.

319
00:26:17,091 --> 00:26:21,633
[SPEAKER_02]: So also they're going to be rolling out some new bundles as well.

320
00:26:21,653 --> 00:26:22,473
[SPEAKER_02]: Infamous 2.

321
00:26:22,573 --> 00:26:24,334
[SPEAKER_02]: I know there's one for Uncharted 3.

322
00:26:24,554 --> 00:26:25,294
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it'll work?

323
00:26:52,487 --> 00:26:55,268
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll help drive sales, that's for sure.

324
00:26:55,809 --> 00:27:00,131
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether it pushes the whole 3D platform.

325
00:27:00,251 --> 00:27:03,672
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you think 3D gaming is really what people want right now?

326
00:27:03,692 --> 00:27:05,673
[SPEAKER_10]: Does anyone in the room really want that?

327
00:27:05,693 --> 00:27:09,615
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a part of me, which I know is ironic because I own a 3DS, but I'm kind of like...

328
00:27:11,515 --> 00:27:15,176
[SPEAKER_10]: 3DS is flashing the pan enough for me, I don't know how I feel about it in my living room

329
00:27:28,741 --> 00:27:34,927
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it'll be better once it's more of a passive technology instead of having these active shutter glasses that cost $100 each.

330
00:27:35,527 --> 00:27:49,321
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it needs to be to the point where it's like, okay, here's some polarized glasses, like the crap that you get at the movie theater, where that would be maybe a few bucks a pair of glasses, and then it's alright.

331
00:27:49,361 --> 00:27:50,863
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you can invite your friends over, you have...

332
00:27:51,483 --> 00:28:05,477
[SPEAKER_10]: plenty of glasses that go around for them to do that kind of stuff I'm laughing to myself now because speaking of 3D totally forgot to mention played Ridge Racer 3DS this week because I bought it during the Amazon DS 3DS sale last week oops

333
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:08,163
[SPEAKER_02]: It's awesome, isn't it?

334
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:12,326
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, it's a really good show-off-the-system kind of game.

335
00:28:12,526 --> 00:28:16,649
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, if you want to show off the 3D and show off... Some of it's a little gimmicky.

336
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:21,153
[SPEAKER_10]: Like the whole, like, oh, there's got to be confetti flying at your face in every race.

337
00:28:21,193 --> 00:28:25,716
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's kind of bootsy because the confetti does not go at, like, 30 frames a second.

338
00:28:26,076 --> 00:28:27,437
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks really bootsy to me.

339
00:28:28,278 --> 00:28:31,000
[SPEAKER_10]: And some of the collision is a little dippy.

340
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,202
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, it just doesn't control... Like, if you...

341
00:28:33,522 --> 00:28:34,243
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

342
00:28:52,318 --> 00:28:53,779
[SPEAKER_10]: The technology is how far along.

343
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,842
[SPEAKER_10]: But otherwise, the 3D effects are pretty good.

344
00:28:57,443 --> 00:28:58,364
[SPEAKER_10]: And yeah, I liked it.

345
00:28:58,424 --> 00:29:02,729
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, I didn't mean to turn your story into a Ridge Racer 3DS review, but I just forgot to mention that.

346
00:29:02,749 --> 00:29:03,129
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's alright.

347
00:29:03,149 --> 00:29:05,932
[SPEAKER_02]: Another system that Ridge Racer is really awesome on, the PSP.

348
00:29:06,933 --> 00:29:11,819
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're late to the game and really want to get into the last generation...

349
00:29:12,299 --> 00:29:15,001
[SPEAKER_02]: Soon to be last generation of handhelds from Sony.

350
00:29:15,521 --> 00:29:17,403
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do so for 99 euro.

351
00:29:18,504 --> 00:29:21,826
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be a new PSP model that's kind of a different look to it.

352
00:29:22,867 --> 00:29:25,209
[SPEAKER_02]: More of like a sleek black.

353
00:29:26,009 --> 00:29:27,150
[SPEAKER_10]: Weren't they all sleek black?

354
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:27,630
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh wait, no.

355
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:28,671
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they were shiny.

356
00:29:28,731 --> 00:29:29,532
[SPEAKER_02]: This is more of like a matte.

357
00:29:29,552 --> 00:29:30,452
[SPEAKER_02]: Alan has a silver one.

358
00:29:30,533 --> 00:29:31,813
[SPEAKER_02]: This is like a matte finish.

359
00:29:34,327 --> 00:29:35,528
[SPEAKER_02]: and it will not have Wi-Fi.

360
00:29:36,648 --> 00:29:38,029
[SPEAKER_02]: It is without Wi-Fi.

361
00:29:38,229 --> 00:29:43,011
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're thinking of playing multiplayer games, uh-uh, not going to happen.

362
00:29:44,932 --> 00:29:47,313
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting that they cut out the Wi-Fi.

363
00:29:47,333 --> 00:29:49,014
[SPEAKER_10]: You going to surf the web?

364
00:29:49,274 --> 00:29:49,474
[SPEAKER_10]: Nope.

365
00:29:50,355 --> 00:29:54,377
[SPEAKER_10]: That is a pretty big component of the PSP that they just kind of chopped out.

366
00:29:54,457 --> 00:30:01,280
[SPEAKER_10]: But at the same time, you look at it and go, eh, but it's only 99 euros, which I imagine would mean $99 here.

367
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:02,721
[SPEAKER_10]: Have they even announced it for America?

368
00:30:03,303 --> 00:30:04,244
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not coming to America.

369
00:30:05,085 --> 00:30:05,886
[SPEAKER_02]: It's only in Europe.

370
00:30:06,487 --> 00:30:07,167
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is that?

371
00:30:07,728 --> 00:30:09,750
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that just because Sony does better in Europe?

372
00:30:10,431 --> 00:30:12,353
[SPEAKER_10]: Is this our punishment for rejecting the Go?

373
00:30:14,415 --> 00:30:14,856
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not.

374
00:30:15,156 --> 00:30:20,161
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you're really looking for a cheap system, and this is the problem with this.

375
00:30:20,602 --> 00:30:25,087
[SPEAKER_02]: Once again, they're releasing something that they think is cheap, but it's not.

376
00:30:25,472 --> 00:30:25,933
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

377
00:30:41,335 --> 00:30:41,976
[SPEAKER_02]: for less.

378
00:30:42,576 --> 00:30:50,721
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, so why would you go and try to buy something brand new for slightly less and it's really kind of a crippled version of the system?

379
00:30:51,321 --> 00:30:54,323
[SPEAKER_02]: Same thing was like with what the PSP Go was.

380
00:30:55,524 --> 00:30:59,626
[SPEAKER_02]: Why would you buy something, you know, more expensive that comes crippled?

381
00:30:59,886 --> 00:31:00,967
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't make any sense.

382
00:31:01,327 --> 00:31:02,028
[SPEAKER_02]: No one wants that.

383
00:31:02,428 --> 00:31:09,052
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, they might as well make it smaller and call it the PSP Micro because that's how it's going to sell.

384
00:31:10,856 --> 00:31:11,577
[SPEAKER_02]: No one's going to want it.

385
00:31:12,678 --> 00:31:15,582
[SPEAKER_02]: Why even bother releasing a new PSP anyways?

386
00:31:15,822 --> 00:31:19,186
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, I think people are already done with the PSP.

387
00:31:19,447 --> 00:31:21,690
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of at the end of its life cycle already.

388
00:31:22,871 --> 00:31:28,478
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe it's kind of their last hurrah for the holiday because the Vita didn't make it.

389
00:31:30,164 --> 00:31:31,264
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter.

390
00:31:31,284 --> 00:31:33,965
[SPEAKER_02]: Put out a new 3000 bundle or something like that.

391
00:31:34,005 --> 00:31:39,527
[SPEAKER_02]: They just had one that came out with Madden and Need for Speed in it or something like that in the US.

392
00:31:40,047 --> 00:31:44,969
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do we have to... Why even bother releasing a new system?

393
00:31:45,289 --> 00:31:51,851
[SPEAKER_02]: Why spend the time right now to redesign the system to make it slightly cheaper to put it out anyways?

394
00:31:52,071 --> 00:31:54,792
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing I can think of is that they're trying to cash in on...

395
00:31:58,707 --> 00:32:01,328
[SPEAKER_02]: on these reduced price games that they have coming out.

396
00:32:01,348 --> 00:32:05,990
[SPEAKER_02]: They have some UMD dual packs that are coming out for $10 from a bunch of third-party companies.

397
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:08,892
[SPEAKER_02]: And, I mean, it's a good deal if you're looking for really cheap games.

398
00:32:09,332 --> 00:32:13,454
[SPEAKER_02]: And, yes, you can still download stuff off the PlayStation Store.

399
00:32:14,154 --> 00:32:21,057
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have a PC or a PlayStation 3, you can download it straight off there and put it on a memory stick or something like that.

400
00:32:21,437 --> 00:32:26,540
[SPEAKER_02]: But, I mean, seriously, just buy a used system if you're really going to do that.

401
00:32:27,861 --> 00:32:31,087
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no reason to buy this.

402
00:32:31,368 --> 00:32:33,171
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, it's just a buy you system.

403
00:32:34,594 --> 00:32:37,139
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell, you could probably even find a new system for that price.

404
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,604
[SPEAKER_02]: If people are sitting on inventory for it.

405
00:32:44,102 --> 00:32:44,583
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

406
00:32:44,683 --> 00:32:46,486
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we see how Loki feels about that.

407
00:32:46,967 --> 00:32:47,387
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

408
00:32:48,569 --> 00:32:51,394
[SPEAKER_10]: I do have to admit the idea of a new PSP is a little silly.

409
00:32:51,914 --> 00:32:59,005
[SPEAKER_10]: I think Loki makes a damn good argument that if you can get a used one cheaper than this, then why go for this when you're missing Wi-Fi?

410
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:15,054
[SPEAKER_10]: Before he kind of pointed that out, I was thinking, all right, well, it's a way for them to get the system out under $100, so it looks really appealing to maybe younger folks that kind of want one, but the parents don't want to spend that much money on a toy.

411
00:33:15,554 --> 00:33:16,075
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I mean?

412
00:33:16,855 --> 00:33:17,576
[SPEAKER_10]: But, hmm.

413
00:33:18,911 --> 00:33:19,151
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

414
00:33:19,291 --> 00:33:22,614
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, anyhow, let's talk about the other handheld system, and that would be the 3DS.

415
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:27,397
[SPEAKER_10]: As you all, I'm sure, are aware, the 3DS recently had a huge price cut going on to it.

416
00:33:28,038 --> 00:33:29,699
[SPEAKER_10]: And that price cut included Japan.

417
00:33:30,219 --> 00:33:33,402
[SPEAKER_10]: And in Japan, the price of the device went from 25,000 yen down to 15,000 yen.

418
00:33:33,442 --> 00:33:33,982
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a huge price.

419
00:33:34,002 --> 00:33:34,122
[SPEAKER_10]: That's...

420
00:33:37,845 --> 00:33:40,166
[SPEAKER_10]: That's almost larger than the one that it had here in the US.

421
00:33:41,506 --> 00:33:42,827
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's very big.

422
00:33:43,927 --> 00:33:45,168
[SPEAKER_10]: And what was the effect of that?

423
00:33:45,288 --> 00:33:47,869
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, a lot more 3DSs sold.

424
00:33:48,069 --> 00:33:59,032
[SPEAKER_10]: And this week it was announced that, let's see, a couple different figures are out there about exactly how many units sold between August 8th and August 14th.

425
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:01,153
[SPEAKER_10]: But generally it's around 210,000 units sold.

426
00:34:04,014 --> 00:34:10,936
[SPEAKER_10]: Keep in mind that the launch week of the system saw about, what, 350,000 units sold?

427
00:34:11,616 --> 00:34:13,617
[SPEAKER_10]: Or no, 375,000 units sold.

428
00:34:13,677 --> 00:34:18,318
[SPEAKER_10]: So by cutting the price, you got numbers that were almost back to launch week.

429
00:34:18,398 --> 00:34:22,339
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, the numbers this past week were larger than they were in week two.

430
00:34:22,939 --> 00:34:27,060
[SPEAKER_10]: And it pushed the adoption mark past 1.5 million.

431
00:34:30,461 --> 00:34:36,163
[SPEAKER_10]: So apparently the price cut did exactly what Nintendo needed it to do and it moved more systems, right?

432
00:34:37,223 --> 00:34:37,703
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

433
00:34:38,024 --> 00:34:39,544
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just an overpriced system.

434
00:34:39,764 --> 00:34:47,906
[SPEAKER_02]: And right now, I mean, they could have probably put it out the original price if they had a good lineup of games, but they didn't.

435
00:34:48,006 --> 00:34:49,327
[SPEAKER_02]: So they need to do something.

436
00:34:49,347 --> 00:34:52,408
[SPEAKER_02]: Either put out some good games or drop the price.

437
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:56,769
[SPEAKER_02]: And right now they need to drop the price if they want to gain momentum going into the fourth quarter.

438
00:34:56,909 --> 00:35:01,951
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, here's the other thing I want to know about, and that is what is the sales going to look like the next week?

439
00:35:02,372 --> 00:35:13,777
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I'm sure you had a lot of people that ran out and bought one, especially in the U.S., because we had those stores that all cut the price early so that folks could get on that, and then they could be the early adopters as well.

440
00:35:14,097 --> 00:35:15,678
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm sure the sales figures in the U.S.

441
00:35:15,718 --> 00:35:18,199
[SPEAKER_10]: are going to look very similar when those numbers come out very soon.

442
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:21,301
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'm curious, what's it going to look like in two weeks?

443
00:35:21,821 --> 00:35:24,063
[SPEAKER_10]: What's the long-term sales of this?

444
00:35:24,103 --> 00:35:25,244
[SPEAKER_10]: And then, of course, through the holiday.

445
00:35:25,625 --> 00:35:28,127
[SPEAKER_10]: I really don't think any of this matters until the holiday.

446
00:35:28,467 --> 00:35:30,790
[SPEAKER_10]: The holiday is what's really going to make or break the system.

447
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:35,574
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, honestly, it didn't really, from my perspective, it didn't really do much.

448
00:35:35,634 --> 00:35:39,578
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, none of my customers were really buying more systems.

449
00:35:39,618 --> 00:35:43,742
[SPEAKER_02]: They were just kind of like, great, now I can get rid of the system that's been sitting on my shelf for four months.

450
00:35:43,762 --> 00:35:45,964
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, they probably just wanted to sell the shit they have.

451
00:35:49,293 --> 00:35:51,374
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if that's the situation.

452
00:35:51,714 --> 00:35:58,218
[SPEAKER_02]: If a lot of the retailers out there were just sitting on these systems, then you may not see the spike that you see in Japan right now.

453
00:36:00,099 --> 00:36:04,941
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm sure it'll help, but I don't know if it's going to be that significant.

454
00:36:05,902 --> 00:36:10,484
[SPEAKER_10]: Akuma JP is in our chat room right now at chat.orangeandre.com, and he is a listener of ours from Japan.

455
00:36:10,905 --> 00:36:16,228
[SPEAKER_10]: And he says, kind of in response to this, a lot of mothers complained because they bought it on the first day.

456
00:36:17,688 --> 00:36:18,449
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell you something.

457
00:36:18,629 --> 00:36:20,310
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell you what you're going to see.

458
00:36:21,571 --> 00:36:24,093
[SPEAKER_02]: I guarantee you'll see this by early next month.

459
00:36:24,934 --> 00:36:29,677
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to see Nintendo come out because the NPD numbers are going to come out.

460
00:36:29,738 --> 00:36:32,339
[SPEAKER_02]: 3DS is the top handheld system of August.

461
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,182
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because the PSP isn't selling very well.

462
00:36:35,242 --> 00:36:36,983
[SPEAKER_02]: The DS isn't selling very well.

463
00:36:37,343 --> 00:36:40,706
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course the 3DS is going to be the top system now that they did a price drop.

464
00:36:41,006 --> 00:36:43,068
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's PR spin for you.

465
00:36:43,128 --> 00:36:44,869
[SPEAKER_02]: So look for that early next month.

466
00:36:45,256 --> 00:36:48,020
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, what's the long-term effect of a statement like that?

467
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:55,429
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, I don't see soccer moms running out and buying a 3DS because, oh, well, it was the top-selling system in August, according to MPD.

468
00:36:55,829 --> 00:36:58,293
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they're just hoping that that kind of momentum will carry on.

469
00:36:58,853 --> 00:36:59,895
[SPEAKER_02]: And it very well might.

470
00:37:00,035 --> 00:37:00,575
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, because...

471
00:37:02,375 --> 00:37:29,427
[SPEAKER_10]: you know the DS and the PSP are kind of being phased out when that Mario game hits all they have to do look this is all Nintendo has to do bundle that fucking Mario game with a 3DS that thing will sell like crazy for Christmas watch Dan's holding off until the flame one comes out because that's what he wants he wants the flare red he likes his 3DS like he likes his homosexuals flaming and yeah

472
00:37:31,932 --> 00:37:32,132
[SPEAKER_08]: Red.

473
00:37:32,873 --> 00:37:33,933
[SPEAKER_08]: Red's Dan's favorite color.

474
00:37:34,454 --> 00:37:35,655
[SPEAKER_08]: And he wants Star Fox.

475
00:37:36,475 --> 00:37:38,076
[SPEAKER_08]: So those are what's selling it for him.

476
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:42,979
[SPEAKER_10]: I just... Like, if Nintendo wants to sell a shit ton of 3DSs, that's all they have to do.

477
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:47,242
[SPEAKER_10]: And, like, kids will be wanting that shit all Christmas long.

478
00:37:47,623 --> 00:37:50,284
[SPEAKER_10]: And it'll be a huge thing that ends up under the Christmas tree this year.

479
00:37:50,905 --> 00:37:53,106
[SPEAKER_10]: It might even end up being the must-have toy.

480
00:37:53,647 --> 00:37:58,410
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, if this shit does Netflix and all this other stuff, like, Nintendo could make this the must-have toy.

481
00:37:58,550 --> 00:37:58,830
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

482
00:37:59,170 --> 00:37:59,410
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

483
00:37:59,731 --> 00:38:00,851
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gonna be the must-have toy?

484
00:38:01,132 --> 00:38:01,552
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought...

485
00:38:02,233 --> 00:38:03,775
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is coming from Activision.

486
00:38:03,996 --> 00:38:06,420
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought Skylanders was gonna be the must-have toy.

487
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:08,723
[SPEAKER_02]: What the fuck is a Skylanders?

488
00:38:09,004 --> 00:38:09,845
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly!

489
00:38:10,426 --> 00:38:14,533
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a pain in my ass is what it is right now, and we'll get into that later on, but...

490
00:38:19,103 --> 00:38:23,387
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm trying to say this without sounding like a fanboy.

491
00:38:24,208 --> 00:38:26,650
[SPEAKER_10]: You all heard what I said about what I did with my Wii earlier.

492
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:28,272
[SPEAKER_10]: So look, that shows you where I'm at.

493
00:38:28,712 --> 00:38:30,614
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the 3DS will be the top selling system.

494
00:38:30,634 --> 00:38:31,775
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it will outsell the consoles.

495
00:38:32,416 --> 00:38:33,677
[SPEAKER_08]: Rob's modified his Wii.

496
00:38:35,759 --> 00:38:37,120
[SPEAKER_10]: I needed it to be more versatile.

497
00:38:39,221 --> 00:38:48,627
[SPEAKER_10]: But no, seriously, I think the 3DS will sell more than the living room consoles because I think most people that want to have an Xbox 360 already have one.

498
00:38:49,207 --> 00:38:54,450
[SPEAKER_10]: The only maybe kind of possibly that could screw me on that prediction would be the PlayStation 3.

499
00:38:55,150 --> 00:39:00,893
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the whole price cut for the PlayStation 3, the fact that it plays Blu-rays, the fact that it's going to do 3D,

500
00:39:02,495 --> 00:39:03,796
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't underestimate that shit.

501
00:39:04,316 --> 00:39:06,158
[SPEAKER_10]: Do not underestimate the power of that shit.

502
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:17,449
[SPEAKER_02]: Do not underestimate the power of Microsoft and if they feel that their sales are dipping because of the PlayStation 3 dropping in price they can still drop the price.

503
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:22,635
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember you angry cynical sarcastic gamers soccer moms do not think like you.

504
00:39:25,255 --> 00:39:26,376
[SPEAKER_08]: They are not rational.

505
00:39:26,436 --> 00:39:28,876
[SPEAKER_08]: They cannot be.

506
00:39:29,316 --> 00:39:31,497
[SPEAKER_10]: They should be put down immediately when spotted.

507
00:39:31,517 --> 00:39:31,977
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'm kidding.

508
00:39:32,017 --> 00:39:32,317
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm kidding.

509
00:39:32,837 --> 00:39:38,039
[SPEAKER_08]: They feel no mercy, no remorse, and they will not stop until you are dead.

510
00:39:38,859 --> 00:39:41,220
[SPEAKER_10]: But that's pretty much what it is.

511
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:53,483
[SPEAKER_10]: I love when I read predictions on gaming sites from gaming fanboys going, well, this is going to be this way because gamers want this, da-da-da-da, without realizing, well, soccer moms spend more money than gamers do, probably, at the end of the day.

512
00:39:53,763 --> 00:39:56,387
[SPEAKER_10]: Why else is the Wii the number one console for so many years?

513
00:39:56,527 --> 00:39:57,008
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's be real.

514
00:39:57,728 --> 00:40:01,534
[SPEAKER_02]: Because soccer moms buy, you know, Black Ops.

515
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:29,069
[SPEAKER_10]: Well actually they do because they don't read So I think the Vita getting out of Nintendo's way essentially whether that was intentional or not whereas I think I honestly think Sony's just trying to plan a better launch I think Sony was starting to realize they did not want to have a launch go like the 3DS's launch and if they didn't have the games to back it up they shouldn't launch their system I think that's why they've held it back a little bit

516
00:40:30,370 --> 00:40:31,691
[SPEAKER_10]: At least in America and Europe.

517
00:40:31,812 --> 00:40:33,573
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know why they're still going ahead in Japan.

518
00:40:33,633 --> 00:40:35,094
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe there's going to be more games out there.

519
00:40:35,134 --> 00:40:35,454
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

520
00:40:36,035 --> 00:40:36,775
[SPEAKER_10]: So, we'll see.

521
00:40:37,656 --> 00:40:42,300
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's totally cleared the way for 3DSs to just fly these holidays.

522
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:43,240
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see.

523
00:40:43,981 --> 00:40:44,742
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe I'll be wrong.

524
00:40:45,022 --> 00:40:45,662
[SPEAKER_10]: It's happened before.

525
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:47,704
[SPEAKER_02]: Spread your wings and fly, 3DS.

526
00:40:47,844 --> 00:40:49,165
[SPEAKER_02]: Spread your wings and fly.

527
00:40:50,066 --> 00:40:51,487
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, let's move on to some other stories.

528
00:40:51,507 --> 00:40:51,947
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura.

529
00:40:51,987 --> 00:40:54,069
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, better that it spreads that than something else.

530
00:40:54,885 --> 00:40:57,227
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, moving forward.

531
00:40:58,228 --> 00:41:03,573
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Japanese retailers are not going to be doing much with the Xbox 360 anymore.

532
00:41:04,153 --> 00:41:17,344
[SPEAKER_08]: It just hit 1.5 million units sold, which is basically... That's in six years, by the way, which is basically what the 3DS did in six months, and that was considered selling badly.

533
00:41:18,265 --> 00:41:19,946
[SPEAKER_02]: You know why it's not doing well over there?

534
00:41:19,966 --> 00:41:20,787
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they're racists.

535
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:29,039
[SPEAKER_08]: The last big Japanese exclusive came out, Idolmaster 2, is actually going to be coming out on PlayStation 3 now.

536
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:36,325
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I mean, it's the biggest retailer out there, Jio, is cutting back their stock, but said that they're still going to be available online.

537
00:41:36,766 --> 00:41:40,288
[SPEAKER_10]: By the way, totally hacking my Xbox next so I can play Idolmaster.

538
00:41:40,669 --> 00:41:41,109
[SPEAKER_10]: Just saying.

539
00:41:42,951 --> 00:41:45,693
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I would rather play Hatsune Miku, but...

540
00:41:46,007 --> 00:41:56,995
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, at any rate, the quotes going on saying is that it is our understanding that Amazon now handles a substantial portion of Japanese Xbox 360 software sales.

541
00:41:57,035 --> 00:41:59,036
[SPEAKER_08]: So basically, they say, you want it?

542
00:41:59,096 --> 00:41:59,756
[SPEAKER_08]: Get it online.

543
00:42:00,377 --> 00:42:01,798
[SPEAKER_08]: Amazon.co.jp.

544
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:03,759
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it.

545
00:42:04,219 --> 00:42:06,221
[SPEAKER_10]: We could special order one of those for you.

546
00:42:09,451 --> 00:42:09,991
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you think?

547
00:42:10,291 --> 00:42:12,834
[SPEAKER_10]: Is this really, really bad news for the 360?

548
00:42:13,014 --> 00:42:16,217
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not surprising.

549
00:42:16,577 --> 00:42:23,243
[SPEAKER_08]: The system, the games, aren't really geared towards Japanese players, I think.

550
00:42:25,425 --> 00:42:28,327
[SPEAKER_08]: My thought is that it's sort of like the reverse Dreamcast.

551
00:42:29,668 --> 00:42:30,469
[SPEAKER_08]: Or the Saturn.

552
00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:32,271
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a good example, the Saturn.

553
00:42:34,189 --> 00:42:37,311
[SPEAKER_08]: Sega Saturn in Japan, fantastic.

554
00:42:38,032 --> 00:42:43,035
[SPEAKER_08]: It was top seller, it really was well supported, great games.

555
00:42:44,116 --> 00:42:46,798
[SPEAKER_08]: Over in the US, not so good, not so good.

556
00:42:48,159 --> 00:42:57,325
[SPEAKER_08]: How many people do you know who still have an old Nintendo, not Nintendo, a Playstation sitting in their closet collecting dust but never ever played a Saturn?

557
00:42:58,145 --> 00:42:58,706
[SPEAKER_08]: That's over here.

558
00:42:59,546 --> 00:43:26,242
[SPEAKER_08]: and then you sort of got the converse going on now with the Xbox 360 and with the Xbox that it just didn't catch on over there maybe it was marketing maybe it was that it wasn't a long time trusted brand over there perhaps whatever reason that it is but I think that it's the same situation it's not marketed the right way it's not pushing towards that audience

559
00:43:26,702 --> 00:43:26,822
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

560
00:43:26,842 --> 00:43:26,942
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

561
00:43:51,334 --> 00:43:52,375
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I don't know.

562
00:43:52,435 --> 00:43:56,137
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I don't think it necessarily spells the end of the 360, certainly.

563
00:43:56,157 --> 00:43:57,258
[SPEAKER_10]: They're going to keep pushing forward.

564
00:43:57,278 --> 00:44:00,100
[SPEAKER_10]: They've done very well in the U.S., that's for sure.

565
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:03,943
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that's the point, is that its performance here has been good enough.

566
00:44:04,303 --> 00:44:09,447
[SPEAKER_08]: Because, I mean, I'm sure the Dreamcast release in Japan was not based on American sales of the Saturn.

567
00:44:09,967 --> 00:44:10,648
[SPEAKER_08]: I can tell you that.

568
00:44:11,868 --> 00:44:18,253
[SPEAKER_08]: But it could possibly be that maybe the next Microsoft system to come out won't come out in Japan.

569
00:44:19,884 --> 00:44:35,812
[SPEAKER_08]: that could be very interesting if that happens I honestly can't see that happening I think Microsoft has to try again you know what I see if it does happen that way we get a system over here that's not region locked or it's only available

570
00:44:37,986 --> 00:44:41,387
[SPEAKER_10]: God, I wish a non-region lock system would happen.

571
00:44:41,407 --> 00:44:45,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the games that come out on the 360 are not region locked.

572
00:44:46,209 --> 00:44:47,109
[SPEAKER_02]: Just saying.

573
00:44:47,289 --> 00:45:04,114
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the Japanese games that come out are, for some reason, from the Japanese companies, but for the most part, a lot of your big first party games like EA, or third party games like from EA, Ubisoft, that kind of stuff, they are not region locked.

574
00:45:05,194 --> 00:45:28,994
[SPEAKER_02]: you just have to look online either on release sites or on like PlayAsia has a good list of stuff that's not region locked and you can literally import that stuff back and forth there are a few Japanese games that do come out over there region free and you can bring them over here there are some of the cave shmups that were region free but it's rare, it's definitely more rare but you know

575
00:45:29,554 --> 00:45:32,678
[SPEAKER_02]: I seriously think that if they were going to be smart about it and try to

576
00:45:48,092 --> 00:46:07,186
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess avoid the same situation than when they bring out a US game they have a Japanese subtitle on it already or a Japanese menu that's just available through options I don't know how many Japanese games I have that have menus fully in English so it's not a big deal

577
00:46:07,406 --> 00:46:12,871
[SPEAKER_02]: And even if the next system is region locked, most likely it's going to be on Blu-ray or some sort of proprietary format.

578
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:14,252
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to guess probably Blu-ray.

579
00:46:15,714 --> 00:46:19,257
[SPEAKER_02]: And if that's the case, we're the same region as Japan anyways, Blu-ray wise.

580
00:46:20,038 --> 00:46:21,599
[SPEAKER_02]: Video, I mean... No, we're not.

581
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:22,600
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we are.

582
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:23,421
[SPEAKER_08]: No, we are not.

583
00:46:23,521 --> 00:46:25,403
[SPEAKER_02]: It's region A. They're both the same.

584
00:46:25,703 --> 00:46:27,324
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, well, for Blu-ray, I'm sorry, I was thinking DVD.

585
00:46:27,905 --> 00:46:28,866
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not the same for DVD.

586
00:46:29,546 --> 00:46:30,667
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yes, not for DVD.

587
00:46:30,848 --> 00:46:32,349
[SPEAKER_02]: For Blu-ray, we are the same region.

588
00:46:33,163 --> 00:46:40,448
[SPEAKER_08]: But regardless, the point that I was trying to make is that if they're going to be smart about this, they'll have all the games come on already.

589
00:46:41,408 --> 00:46:54,877
[SPEAKER_08]: I wouldn't say fully localized, but they will have menus or, you know, even work with, you know, between the Japanese staff and American staff for two country developers.

590
00:46:54,917 --> 00:46:55,378
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?

591
00:46:56,518 --> 00:47:01,541
[SPEAKER_08]: and then release a version that's got just everything in it already.

592
00:47:02,842 --> 00:47:03,782
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, here's an example.

593
00:47:03,822 --> 00:47:10,626
[SPEAKER_08]: Sonic Adventure, when it came out in the US, had Japanese subtitles and Japanese voices in it and the English voices.

594
00:47:11,706 --> 00:47:12,567
[SPEAKER_10]: Can I ask this real quick?

595
00:47:12,587 --> 00:47:18,490
[SPEAKER_10]: Because Breakman's asking this in the chat room and this is a really good question that I'm not even sure I know the answer to this.

596
00:47:19,371 --> 00:47:24,433
[SPEAKER_10]: Breakman in chat asks, OLR, seriously, why is region locking so important to these companies?

597
00:47:24,753 --> 00:47:25,394
[SPEAKER_10]: What's the point?

598
00:47:25,994 --> 00:47:27,635
[SPEAKER_08]: And a part of it has to do with demographics.

599
00:47:28,035 --> 00:47:29,075
[SPEAKER_10]: It's licensing, right?

600
00:47:29,115 --> 00:47:29,855
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, licensing.

601
00:47:30,055 --> 00:47:33,176
[SPEAKER_02]: License stuff for certain regions.

602
00:47:33,316 --> 00:47:36,998
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, obviously, some of them, they just kind of don't put it in there.

603
00:47:37,138 --> 00:47:37,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Branding, too.

604
00:47:38,198 --> 00:47:38,718
[SPEAKER_08]: Branding, too.

605
00:47:40,899 --> 00:47:45,060
[SPEAKER_10]: I can see where, like, the NFL games, you know, NFL's very protective about their shit.

606
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:47,921
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I'm sure those NFL games have to be region locked.

607
00:47:47,981 --> 00:47:48,642
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they're not.

608
00:47:49,262 --> 00:47:50,022
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you say that for?

609
00:47:51,172 --> 00:47:51,813
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

610
00:48:10,547 --> 00:48:15,929
[SPEAKER_10]: All the machines that you saw over here were being imported from Japan and they really technically weren't supposed to be.

611
00:48:15,989 --> 00:48:17,410
[SPEAKER_10]: They were quote unquote illegal.

612
00:48:18,350 --> 00:48:20,691
[SPEAKER_10]: But it was kind of one of those things they didn't really enforce.

613
00:48:21,112 --> 00:48:27,134
[SPEAKER_10]: Konami just kind of quietly turned their backs to it because, you know, obviously it was raising awareness for all the console versions.

614
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:28,855
[SPEAKER_08]: And they did actually have an official U.S.

615
00:48:28,915 --> 00:48:29,215
[SPEAKER_08]: machine.

616
00:48:29,395 --> 00:48:29,535
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

617
00:48:29,575 --> 00:48:31,236
[SPEAKER_10]: Those songs were licensed.

618
00:48:31,616 --> 00:48:32,557
[SPEAKER_10]: Dance Mania

619
00:48:55,914 --> 00:48:58,715
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a little back and forth with Madden.

620
00:48:58,735 --> 00:49:02,716
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Madden has been region-free the last couple games.

621
00:49:04,077 --> 00:49:05,677
[SPEAKER_02]: 10 and 11 were both region-free.

622
00:49:06,137 --> 00:49:08,518
[SPEAKER_02]: NCAA football, though, in the U.S.

623
00:49:08,658 --> 00:49:10,559
[SPEAKER_02]: this year was not region-free.

624
00:49:10,619 --> 00:49:12,599
[SPEAKER_02]: It was only NCSC.

625
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:18,261
[SPEAKER_02]: Then, for example, some games that are coming out that have already leaked out.

626
00:49:19,001 --> 00:49:31,308
[SPEAKER_02]: DSX, Human Revolution, Region 3, Colorado Warriors, The Cartel, that's also Region 3, Captain America was Region 3, Harry Potter was Region 3.

627
00:49:34,717 --> 00:49:36,858
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a Tour de France game that came out.

628
00:49:37,759 --> 00:49:42,461
[SPEAKER_02]: Not even in our region, but that's both region for PAL and NTSC.

629
00:49:42,881 --> 00:49:43,621
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of funny there.

630
00:49:44,162 --> 00:49:45,702
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a game that's never coming out over here.

631
00:49:46,102 --> 00:49:49,144
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that I'd play it, but whatever.

632
00:49:50,364 --> 00:49:54,886
[SPEAKER_02]: UFC Personal Trainer, Naughty Bear Gold Edition, Dynasty Warriors 3.

633
00:49:54,926 --> 00:49:54,986
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm...

634
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:59,068
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a lot of games.

635
00:49:59,308 --> 00:50:01,910
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of them are coming out all region.

636
00:50:02,570 --> 00:50:03,951
[SPEAKER_02]: They just don't really advertise it.

637
00:50:04,231 --> 00:50:10,374
[SPEAKER_02]: However, though, a lot of times you'll see the Japanese only games like Red Faction Armageddon in Japan as only a Japanese region game.

638
00:50:10,414 --> 00:50:12,155
[SPEAKER_02]: Same with like Shaun White and that kind of stuff.

639
00:50:12,935 --> 00:50:15,576
[SPEAKER_02]: But the versions that come out over here, I believe...

640
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:19,381
[SPEAKER_02]: are all region.

641
00:50:19,421 --> 00:50:21,463
[SPEAKER_10]: In fact... Go into our chat room real quick again.

642
00:50:21,503 --> 00:50:22,724
[SPEAKER_10]: Chat.orange.studio.com.

643
00:50:22,764 --> 00:50:29,849
[SPEAKER_10]: Frisbee asks, but like, for example, if I buy a Japanese game from a website in Japan, would that affect licensing seeing as you buy it from that country?

644
00:50:30,810 --> 00:50:38,396
[SPEAKER_10]: I think in what you're talking about, I think you kind of answered your own question because, you know, when you're buying a game from Japan, well, your money went to a Japanese company.

645
00:50:38,556 --> 00:51:06,127
[SPEAKER_08]: I will tell you this most Japanese sites will not mail to the US like for example Amazon I've ordered you know I've ordered like a couple of books and a couple of CDs but other than that I haven't ever been able to order games from there they won't take your credit card information when I was ordering my because I had the money I was going to order my 2DX controller

646
00:51:06,727 --> 00:51:07,208
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

647
00:51:14,292 --> 00:51:20,776
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of these stores over here that sell the import stuff, the way they're doing it is that they have an alliance with a Japanese retailer who's feeding them all the goods.

648
00:51:20,996 --> 00:51:22,417
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, that's how they do it.

649
00:51:22,637 --> 00:51:26,519
[SPEAKER_08]: Toys and Joys is out of Hawaii, so they actually bring stuff back.

650
00:51:26,579 --> 00:51:28,160
[SPEAKER_08]: That's how they get it really quickly.

651
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:30,902
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of companies are selling to these guys.

652
00:51:30,942 --> 00:51:34,323
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm assuming it's Japanese distributors for games and stuff like that.

653
00:51:34,724 --> 00:51:35,384
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically...

654
00:51:37,165 --> 00:51:59,667
[SPEAKER_02]: as long as we're shipping to a country or a location within that country it doesn't really matter what you do with it we don't want to know what you do with it it's just if you're going to distribute it in another country you're not really supposed to do that but once again we're just selling it to that person what they do with it from there that's a whole other thing

655
00:52:05,044 --> 00:52:08,830
[SPEAKER_02]: It is kind of stupid that they have region locked stuff on there.

656
00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:13,096
[SPEAKER_10]: Quite the conversation we've had stemming from the Xbox 360 chat in Japan.

657
00:52:13,617 --> 00:52:14,478
[SPEAKER_10]: But let's move on.

658
00:52:14,518 --> 00:52:18,003
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got some more stories to cover here before we get to release dates and then the classic game of the week.

659
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:21,523
[SPEAKER_02]: The PlayStation Vita, there's some more information that came out about it.

660
00:52:22,123 --> 00:52:28,485
[SPEAKER_02]: It was rumored that the RAM was halved to drop the price of the system so that it would be able to compete with the 3DS.

661
00:52:28,925 --> 00:52:30,346
[SPEAKER_02]: However, that is not true.

662
00:52:31,046 --> 00:52:36,228
[SPEAKER_02]: The PlayStation Vita actually has more RAM than the PlayStation 3 in some cases.

663
00:52:37,768 --> 00:52:38,948
[SPEAKER_02]: And also a few other things.

664
00:52:39,008 --> 00:52:40,649
[SPEAKER_02]: They also have cross-game chat.

665
00:52:41,509 --> 00:52:45,710
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can also do... I guess it's part of their party system.

666
00:52:46,411 --> 00:52:46,571
[SPEAKER_02]: The...

667
00:52:48,511 --> 00:53:02,435
[SPEAKER_02]: System has 512 MB of RAM and 128 MB of video RAM compared to the PlayStation 3's 256 MB of system RAM and 256 MB of video RAM.

668
00:53:02,515 --> 00:53:13,758
[SPEAKER_02]: While, of course, the RAM is smaller on the video side, the resolution isn't as great as the PlayStation 3, so it doesn't require as much RAM for textures and stuff as the PlayStation 3 does.

669
00:53:14,498 --> 00:53:39,831
[SPEAKER_02]: but definitely with that kind of RAM in there we'll allow a lot more flexibility with different games and stuff because I know a lot of people have to optimize their game and do different things and cut stuff just to have it run in the limited RAM so that's kind of cool so we'll see some pretty good games coming on that system I'm guessing because of that we can hope

670
00:53:40,956 --> 00:53:41,577
[SPEAKER_10]: That's good.

671
00:53:41,617 --> 00:53:43,298
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess RAM's getting cheaper overall, huh?

672
00:53:43,698 --> 00:53:44,039
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah.

673
00:53:44,119 --> 00:53:44,839
[SPEAKER_10]: It's dirt cheap.

674
00:53:46,261 --> 00:53:47,261
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

675
00:53:47,321 --> 00:53:47,662
[SPEAKER_10]: Moving on.

676
00:53:47,702 --> 00:53:55,388
[SPEAKER_10]: Talking about the Vita and some of the other things that were announced for the Vita this week at Gamescom, PlayStation Vita is going to be getting some more social integration.

677
00:53:56,289 --> 00:54:03,035
[SPEAKER_10]: In fact, they're going to get some of the things that you usually hear about when you think about more of the iOS type of apps, or I guess you could say Android as well.

678
00:54:03,455 --> 00:54:06,097
[SPEAKER_10]: Things like Foursquare, Skype...

679
00:54:06,718 --> 00:54:15,271
[SPEAKER_10]: Twitter, Facebook, all of that is going to be in the PlayStation Vita and I guess that's part of what you can use the whole 3G and all that for.

680
00:54:15,291 --> 00:54:18,196
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember the AT&T 3G that everybody was really excited about?

681
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:22,921
[SPEAKER_10]: All four of those apps, they're going to be free downloads from the PlayStation Network.

682
00:54:24,082 --> 00:54:30,683
[SPEAKER_10]: Doesn't quite say, you know, they didn't hint at if it's going to be at launch or if it's going to be a ways after that.

683
00:54:30,783 --> 00:54:34,044
[SPEAKER_10]: I imagine none of these apps are that complicated.

684
00:54:34,084 --> 00:54:35,105
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure they'll be out.

685
00:54:35,425 --> 00:54:43,227
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, what else is also interesting about them is I believe all of them, except maybe Skype, have open APIs, so they ought to be really easy to develop the apps.

686
00:54:44,628 --> 00:54:45,869
[SPEAKER_10]: Somebody to get in there and do them.

687
00:54:45,929 --> 00:54:50,092
[SPEAKER_10]: So I can't imagine it will be much further after launch if it's not at launch.

688
00:54:52,073 --> 00:54:55,535
[SPEAKER_10]: It could be, and some are theorizing that maybe they're just going to be right on the device when you get them.

689
00:54:55,876 --> 00:54:56,896
[SPEAKER_10]: You won't even have to download them.

690
00:54:56,916 --> 00:54:59,818
[SPEAKER_10]: They'll just be free and on the device waiting for you to use.

691
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:00,619
[SPEAKER_08]: Wouldn't that be nice?

692
00:55:01,580 --> 00:55:02,620
[SPEAKER_10]: So there you go.

693
00:55:02,761 --> 00:55:04,062
[SPEAKER_10]: All that integration is going to be there.

694
00:55:04,082 --> 00:55:05,063
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you guys think?

695
00:55:05,163 --> 00:55:11,288
[SPEAKER_10]: I think Skype specifically is interesting, of course, because Skype is now a Microsoft product.

696
00:55:11,428 --> 00:55:20,716
[SPEAKER_10]: But I don't think that necessarily means that Skype is all things Microsoft and only all things Microsoft at this point anymore.

697
00:55:21,837 --> 00:55:22,578
[SPEAKER_10]: I just think that's it.

698
00:55:22,598 --> 00:55:26,521
[SPEAKER_10]: And that was probably something planned well before the purchase of Skype products.

699
00:55:26,741 --> 00:55:28,923
[SPEAKER_10]: but what about the rest of this integration?

700
00:55:28,983 --> 00:55:30,384
[SPEAKER_10]: Is this a good thing for the Vita?

701
00:55:30,484 --> 00:55:31,645
[SPEAKER_10]: Is this a bad thing?

702
00:55:31,725 --> 00:55:33,926
[SPEAKER_10]: Is this a no one really gives a shit type of thing?

703
00:55:34,347 --> 00:55:54,502
[SPEAKER_10]: That's kind of where I'm at with it is I'm like well I guess some of the things are cool like if you don't have an iPhone or an Android or one of the other phone devices that runs all this stuff but I mean I can't really see using Twitter on my PS Vita because like how often do I use Twitter on my Xbox 360?

704
00:55:54,662 --> 00:55:55,102
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me think.

705
00:55:55,282 --> 00:55:55,642
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh never.

706
00:55:55,663 --> 00:55:56,203
[SPEAKER_10]: Never.

707
00:55:56,523 --> 00:55:59,206
[SPEAKER_10]: I used it once to say, hey, I'm writing a tweet for my 360.

708
00:55:59,527 --> 00:56:00,688
[SPEAKER_10]: I think everybody did that.

709
00:56:00,708 --> 00:56:06,755
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I think though that you would use it a bit more on like a Vita than you would say a 360 because you're taking it with you.

710
00:56:06,775 --> 00:56:07,215
[SPEAKER_10]: I agree.

711
00:56:07,316 --> 00:56:12,161
[SPEAKER_10]: At least the Vita's on the go with you and it makes more sense for things like Foursquare and so forth.

712
00:56:12,181 --> 00:56:13,523
[SPEAKER_10]: But again, I own an iPhone.

713
00:56:13,623 --> 00:56:14,504
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't need it on a Vita.

714
00:56:15,790 --> 00:56:35,099
[SPEAKER_10]: but I understand not everybody's like me you might have a college kid who doesn't really want to pay the amount you have to pay a month to have an iPhone so they have like a cheaper phone that you know just gets the calling job done calling and texting and the basics and then you know we'll have the Vita to do all this fancier stuff like the check-ins and so forth Facebook

715
00:56:36,039 --> 00:57:02,730
[SPEAKER_10]: status updates I'm thinking this also paves the way for you know I don't know this I don't know how I feel about this in a lot of games but it will pave the way for games to automatically post to your Facebook and your Twitter I just got to level 3 whoopee they already have that in a lot of stuff I know they do but not as much as I would think and especially like you don't see it in any 3DS games that I know of um

716
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:06,581
[SPEAKER_10]: And if they are, they're not first party.

717
00:57:07,242 --> 00:57:08,963
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a DS game I know that has that.

718
00:57:09,184 --> 00:57:11,846
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, like one DS game, right?

719
00:57:12,426 --> 00:57:14,308
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't see it in a lot of the games right now.

720
00:57:14,648 --> 00:57:18,532
[SPEAKER_10]: Whereas I think including this stuff on the PS Vita kind of opens the door for more of that stuff.

721
00:57:19,882 --> 00:57:20,822
[SPEAKER_10]: Do people want that?

722
00:57:20,902 --> 00:57:25,964
[SPEAKER_10]: Do people really want their Twitter to just be filled up with, yay, I unlocked a trophy.

723
00:57:26,024 --> 00:57:26,324
[SPEAKER_10]: Whoopee.

724
00:57:26,564 --> 00:57:37,288
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I guess I have the trophy stuff post to my Facebook, which I kind of show that more as a way to kind of tell people what games I'm really into right now without having to put an update.

725
00:57:37,348 --> 00:57:39,789
[SPEAKER_10]: But some of it's really cumbersome.

726
00:57:40,049 --> 00:57:42,190
[SPEAKER_10]: I would not want updates to go up.

727
00:57:42,210 --> 00:57:45,591
[SPEAKER_10]: You can have your thing announced to Facebook every time you download something.

728
00:57:45,631 --> 00:57:46,791
[SPEAKER_10]: That's retarded.

729
00:57:46,891 --> 00:57:47,952
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, ridiculous.

730
00:57:47,992 --> 00:57:48,712
[SPEAKER_08]: That's too much.

731
00:57:49,832 --> 00:58:01,062
[SPEAKER_10]: Porn, porn, porn, porn Breakman in our chatroom says Can I get a Vita that just plays video games?

732
00:58:01,202 --> 00:58:02,083
[SPEAKER_10]: Can it be cheaper then?

733
00:58:02,203 --> 00:58:08,489
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, please Breakman also says Fucking Facebook, can I pay extra to have that not installed?

734
00:58:12,119 --> 00:58:12,459
[SPEAKER_10]: Yikes.

735
00:58:12,539 --> 00:58:16,763
[SPEAKER_10]: No word on Google Plus, or as we call it on Horde House, Google Positive.

736
00:58:16,864 --> 00:58:20,827
[SPEAKER_10]: No word if Google Positive will be one of the apps that will be on the PlayStation Vita.

737
00:58:21,568 --> 00:58:24,291
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, one other quick thing I've got to say about the Vita.

738
00:58:24,411 --> 00:58:30,176
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently, one other thing that they're saying, every PlayStation Vita game will also be downloadable.

739
00:58:30,456 --> 00:58:33,739
[SPEAKER_02]: To what storage on the PlayStation Vita?

740
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:36,122
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there is no storage on the PlayStation Vita.

741
00:58:36,142 --> 00:58:37,203
[SPEAKER_10]: The Vita memory cards.

742
00:58:37,958 --> 00:58:41,380
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, why would I buy the game?

743
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:42,560
[SPEAKER_02]: Think about this.

744
00:58:44,161 --> 00:58:51,204
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only can you buy the cartridge version of the game, for the same price you can download it off the internet.

745
00:58:52,310 --> 00:58:53,952
[SPEAKER_02]: and you can buy a memory card to put it on.

746
00:58:55,193 --> 00:58:56,375
[SPEAKER_02]: Why would I do that?

747
00:58:56,435 --> 00:58:57,496
[SPEAKER_02]: That's stupid.

748
00:58:57,936 --> 00:58:58,777
[SPEAKER_02]: Why would you do that?

749
00:58:59,038 --> 00:59:02,261
[SPEAKER_02]: And no, I guarantee there's not going to be a discount for buying it online.

750
00:59:02,361 --> 00:59:03,863
[SPEAKER_02]: There never is a fucking discount.

751
00:59:04,003 --> 00:59:05,825
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, what if you're a PlayStation Plus subscriber?

752
00:59:06,666 --> 00:59:07,687
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe you'll get a discount.

753
00:59:07,707 --> 00:59:07,927
[SPEAKER_10]: Please.

754
00:59:08,408 --> 00:59:08,728
[SPEAKER_10]: Come on.

755
00:59:09,169 --> 00:59:09,990
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so...

756
00:59:12,367 --> 00:59:12,827
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

757
00:59:12,847 --> 00:59:14,007
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just stupid.

758
00:59:15,388 --> 00:59:22,470
[SPEAKER_10]: But what if, Loki, what if you have to have the game right now and I'm so fat that I can't fit in my car anymore?

759
00:59:23,130 --> 00:59:27,591
[SPEAKER_10]: So I will not be able to drive to the store to get it, but I have to have the game right now.

760
00:59:29,432 --> 00:59:30,072
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's great.

761
00:59:30,132 --> 00:59:34,313
[SPEAKER_02]: You can also purchase a digital copy that you can't resell.

762
00:59:35,914 --> 00:59:39,217
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all used again, so, you know.

763
00:59:41,058 --> 00:59:43,060
[SPEAKER_02]: And it will cost you more money because you have to buy a memory card.

764
00:59:43,841 --> 00:59:45,162
[SPEAKER_02]: That's win-win for Sony.

765
00:59:45,182 --> 00:59:47,924
[SPEAKER_10]: But at least I didn't have to buy the gas to get down to Best Buy.

766
00:59:47,944 --> 00:59:49,366
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, come on.

767
00:59:50,406 --> 00:59:53,609
[SPEAKER_02]: If the gas is that much of a problem for you, and you know what?

768
00:59:54,310 --> 00:59:54,430
[SPEAKER_02]: You...

769
00:59:57,935 --> 01:00:00,097
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, gas is not that expensive yet.

770
01:00:00,877 --> 01:00:04,220
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to cost you a gallon of gas to get down there.

771
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:09,484
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guarantee that memory card, it's going to be more than a few bucks.

772
01:00:09,704 --> 01:00:10,565
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably like $15.

773
01:00:10,605 --> 01:00:13,287
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, TigerClaw in our chat is saying memory cards are cheap nowadays.

774
01:00:14,744 --> 01:00:19,307
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, regular memory cards are cheap nowadays, but this is Sony's proprietary memory card.

775
01:00:19,628 --> 01:00:41,124
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like, you know, Microsoft has their, it's not even really proprietary, it's a proprietary case that we put a laptop hard drive in that we can charge a lot more money for, or our memory cards, or even, hell, they've gone to the point where they're like, hey, we got some USB memory cards that you can use that, you know, I know you can use any thumb drive out there that's, you know, really cheap, but ours are $50.

776
01:00:41,184 --> 01:00:41,304
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

777
01:00:42,706 --> 01:00:44,656
[SPEAKER_02]: for four gigs or whatever it was.

778
01:00:44,676 --> 01:00:45,561
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, come on.

779
01:00:46,499 --> 01:00:51,120
[SPEAKER_10]: That's like the Nintendo Wii SD cards.

780
01:00:52,641 --> 01:00:59,882
[SPEAKER_10]: The Wii will take any SD card, but if you want to get a Nintendo Wii SD card that has a little sticker that says Nintendo Wii on it, it costs like twice as much.

781
01:01:00,062 --> 01:01:01,863
[SPEAKER_08]: I can make a sticker that says Wii, by the way.

782
01:01:01,883 --> 01:01:07,004
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're just like SanDisk cards or something like that, but they're actually like another company that makes them, obviously.

783
01:01:08,825 --> 01:01:14,086
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, unless you're getting some sort of discount on it, like it's half the price.

784
01:01:15,788 --> 01:01:45,165
[SPEAKER_02]: then I see no reason to do this which Sony may do those kinds of crazy sales online or and see I don't understand why they have well I understand why they have proprietary memory cards because they don't want people hacking the system but at the same time and I was kind of shocked because I had to buy my mom a camera a Sony camera and I'm like okay and he's like okay you can pick one of these new memory cards here and they're like you know SDHD cards I'm like wait a second uh don't I have to get a memory stick no they stopped using memory stick a while ago I'm like the

785
01:01:46,212 --> 01:01:47,373
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank God!

786
01:01:47,493 --> 01:01:49,996
[SPEAKER_02]: Get with the program using a common format.

787
01:01:51,798 --> 01:02:00,227
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was kind of cool that they had that, but I don't understand why they don't take those anyways on top of their... Well, I understand, once again, it's piracy.

788
01:02:00,247 --> 01:02:03,010
[SPEAKER_02]: They're worried about people pirating games.

789
01:02:04,719 --> 01:02:05,619
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

790
01:02:27,850 --> 01:02:30,211
[SPEAKER_08]: Nintendo says I'm sorry.

791
01:02:30,772 --> 01:02:31,572
[SPEAKER_08]: My bad.

792
01:02:32,452 --> 01:02:42,357
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically, when Xenoblade came out in the UK, if you pre-ordered in a store, you'd get an exclusive classic controller.

793
01:02:42,738 --> 01:02:43,258
[SPEAKER_08]: It was red.

794
01:02:43,778 --> 01:02:47,920
[SPEAKER_08]: And you could get three A1 size posters signed by the developer.

795
01:02:48,681 --> 01:02:53,003
[SPEAKER_08]: But they did not specify that if you did your pre-orders online, you would not be getting the posters.

796
01:02:54,807 --> 01:02:56,968
[SPEAKER_08]: And they said, Oops!

797
01:02:57,928 --> 01:03:05,932
[SPEAKER_08]: If you previously placed an online pre-order to get these posters sent with your copy of the pre-order bundle, please get in contact with Game or GameStation using links.

798
01:03:05,952 --> 01:03:06,733
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, they've got links on there.

799
01:03:07,053 --> 01:03:16,898
[SPEAKER_08]: So basically, if you're in the UK and you pre-ordered online and wanted your poster and were under the impression you'd be getting a poster, contact the retailer and tell them that Nintendo sucks.

800
01:03:17,018 --> 01:03:18,378
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just a fucking poster.

801
01:03:19,439 --> 01:03:22,040
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's not even personally signed.

802
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:23,941
[SPEAKER_08]: It's digitally signed by the developer.

803
01:03:24,381 --> 01:03:25,983
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's basically photoshopped on there.

804
01:03:26,043 --> 01:03:27,885
[SPEAKER_10]: They did not have their pens out.

805
01:03:28,666 --> 01:03:29,987
[SPEAKER_10]: It's photoshopped.

806
01:03:30,068 --> 01:03:32,270
[SPEAKER_10]: It was the RoboPen is what it was.

807
01:03:32,310 --> 01:03:33,551
[SPEAKER_08]: Just like Obama used to sign bills.

808
01:03:33,571 --> 01:03:34,112
[SPEAKER_08]: DigiPen.

809
01:03:34,573 --> 01:03:35,694
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that what the DigiPen?

810
01:03:36,375 --> 01:03:37,816
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you know, there's a company, DigiPen.

811
01:03:39,158 --> 01:03:40,059
[SPEAKER_08]: It's photoshopped.

812
01:03:42,515 --> 01:03:42,815
[SPEAKER_08]: Oops!

813
01:03:44,096 --> 01:03:44,716
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah.

814
01:03:44,876 --> 01:03:46,837
[SPEAKER_10]: But still, I mean, I get it, though.

815
01:03:47,077 --> 01:03:58,942
[SPEAKER_10]: As much as I'm giving these people a hard time for being mad about their posters, I understand the fact that it is principle, and I understand the fact that Nintendo hasn't been making a lot of smart decisions lately, so why not, you know, kick a little more dirt at them?

816
01:03:59,242 --> 01:04:02,083
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you pre-order it online in America, you're just not getting the game.

817
01:04:06,104 --> 01:04:14,777
[SPEAKER_10]: but here's a lovely poster you can have as a parting gift alright, let's move on to travel the world and look at some release dates and what's coming out to a store near you quite soon

818
01:04:15,250 --> 01:04:15,871
[SPEAKER_02]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

819
01:04:40,092 --> 01:04:46,678
[SPEAKER_02]: including now Super Mario Galaxy, Super Paper Mario, Super Mario Strikers Charged, and Punch-Out!!

820
01:04:47,138 --> 01:04:48,520
[SPEAKER_02]: all for $19.99.

821
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:50,161
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

822
01:04:51,482 --> 01:04:52,223
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm sorry.

823
01:04:52,443 --> 01:04:55,826
[SPEAKER_02]: Shin Megami Tensei Devil Survivor overclocked for the 3DS.

824
01:04:56,206 --> 01:05:00,170
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I thought that was coming out the week after next, but whatever.

825
01:05:02,327 --> 01:05:04,908
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, well, sounds like an exciting week in the US.

826
01:05:05,048 --> 01:05:08,408
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's move to Japan and see how exciting it is over there and their releases.

827
01:05:09,269 --> 01:05:11,909
[SPEAKER_10]: Pretty much the same story, except they don't even have Deus Ex.

828
01:05:12,710 --> 01:05:16,670
[SPEAKER_10]: They get Dirt 3 this week in Japan on August the 25th.

829
01:05:16,730 --> 01:05:17,831
[SPEAKER_10]: That's coming out on the Xbox 360.

830
01:05:18,191 --> 01:05:22,732
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure we're going to start to see those Xbox 360 releases get scaled back quite a bit.

831
01:05:23,512 --> 01:05:25,974
[SPEAKER_10]: On the PlayStation 3, though, they have Dirt 3 as well.

832
01:05:26,074 --> 01:05:28,075
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess this is probably the big game.

833
01:05:28,695 --> 01:05:32,838
[SPEAKER_10]: Monster Hunter Portable 3rd HD version coming out on the PlayStation 3.

834
01:05:33,198 --> 01:05:36,360
[SPEAKER_10]: Wasn't this this whole PSP game getting remade for the PS3?

835
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:36,740
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

836
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:38,741
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, that is finally hitting the shelves this week.

837
01:05:39,261 --> 01:05:41,523
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a friend who's so psychotic about that game.

838
01:05:41,543 --> 01:05:45,825
[SPEAKER_10]: I was going to say that that's probably the big thing people are excited about this week in Japan.

839
01:05:46,466 --> 01:05:51,929
[SPEAKER_10]: But some people might also be into the Koei games and Sengoku Musou 3 Empires.

840
01:05:51,949 --> 01:05:52,269
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

841
01:05:52,549 --> 01:05:53,690
[SPEAKER_10]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

842
01:06:20,424 --> 01:06:36,844
[SPEAKER_10]: that's really it on the PlayStation 3 but I will mention on the Sony PSP there's Black Rock Shooter the game is out this week on the PSP there's lots of special editions one of them comes with this cute little figurine little anime character dressed in white there

843
01:06:37,604 --> 01:06:38,165
[SPEAKER_10]: I kind of like that.

844
01:06:38,185 --> 01:06:39,645
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks like a Vinylmation figure.

845
01:06:40,146 --> 01:06:47,209
[SPEAKER_10]: And the game itself, I don't know, I'm just looking at the screenshots, I don't know, it's kind of like Sin and Punishment slash RPG-ish to me, so that's that.

846
01:06:47,270 --> 01:06:56,034
[SPEAKER_10]: Black Rock Shooter on the Sony PSP, as well as Mobile Suit Gundam, Shingire no Yabu, because it's just not a Japanese month without a new Gundam game.

847
01:06:57,555 --> 01:06:59,776
[SPEAKER_10]: And I believe that is pretty much it for releases.

848
01:06:59,816 --> 01:07:03,498
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm trying to look at the 3DS real quick to see if there's anything of note there.

849
01:07:05,359 --> 01:07:06,020
[SPEAKER_10]: Not this week.

850
01:07:07,603 --> 01:07:08,584
[SPEAKER_08]: So, shall we go to Europe?

851
01:07:08,704 --> 01:07:08,904
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep!

852
01:07:09,565 --> 01:07:30,439
[SPEAKER_08]: On the 23rd, we have Call of Dirty Black Ops Resurrection on Xbox 360, and on the 24th, Hamilton's Great Adventure, Street Fighter 3 Third Strike, Tropico 4, and then on the 26th, which is Friday, there's Pac-Man and Galaga Dimensions, Rugby World Cup 2011, and Deus Ex Human Revolution.

853
01:07:31,300 --> 01:07:31,740
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay!

854
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:31,820
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay!

855
01:07:33,979 --> 01:07:34,239
[SPEAKER_10]: Sweet.

856
01:07:34,780 --> 01:07:35,060
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

857
01:07:35,601 --> 01:07:38,784
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's get a couple more stories in before we get to the classic game of the week.

858
01:07:38,885 --> 01:07:39,125
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki.

859
01:07:39,946 --> 01:07:40,106
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

860
01:07:41,087 --> 01:07:45,872
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked about the new PSP that's coming to Europe that has Wi-Fi removed.

861
01:07:46,393 --> 01:07:48,775
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Nintendo not to be outdone by Sony.

862
01:07:49,076 --> 01:07:55,203
[SPEAKER_02]: They're removing some other stuff in the brand new Wii that is coming out in the UK regions as well.

863
01:07:56,183 --> 01:08:00,927
[SPEAKER_02]: The value Wii for that region will be coming out.

864
01:08:01,207 --> 01:08:02,788
[SPEAKER_02]: They haven't really given a price yet.

865
01:08:02,828 --> 01:08:03,989
[SPEAKER_02]: It's supposed to be cheaper.

866
01:08:05,270 --> 01:08:08,433
[SPEAKER_02]: It is designed to sit horizontally instead of vertically.

867
01:08:09,533 --> 01:08:16,899
[SPEAKER_02]: And apparently the GameCube backwards compatibility, both accessories and games, has been removed.

868
01:08:19,464 --> 01:08:21,787
[SPEAKER_02]: What a great feature.

869
01:08:22,108 --> 01:08:24,631
[SPEAKER_02]: Do out sometime before Christmas.

870
01:08:25,392 --> 01:08:29,056
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to include, I guess, a Wii Remote Plus, Nunchuck, Wii Party, and Wii Sports.

871
01:08:29,677 --> 01:08:31,940
[SPEAKER_02]: Wii Party, wow, that is a throwaway game.

872
01:08:31,980 --> 01:08:33,822
[SPEAKER_02]: They must have had a bunch of extra copies of that.

873
01:08:36,766 --> 01:08:37,727
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, fun times.

874
01:08:39,088 --> 01:08:40,869
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, let's be real, though.

875
01:08:41,129 --> 01:08:43,490
[SPEAKER_10]: How many people are still emulating GameCube games?

876
01:08:43,710 --> 01:08:48,091
[SPEAKER_10]: I can think, and I know as the minute I said that, the chat room's going to light up with this.

877
01:08:48,171 --> 01:08:50,672
[SPEAKER_10]: I can think of one that I play, and that's F-Zero.

878
01:08:50,812 --> 01:08:51,132
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it.

879
01:08:51,172 --> 01:08:51,473
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

880
01:08:52,033 --> 01:08:54,033
[SPEAKER_10]: And they really just need to give that a proper week, at least.

881
01:08:54,053 --> 01:08:54,254
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

882
01:08:54,514 --> 01:08:55,014
[SPEAKER_02]: Fair enough.

883
01:08:55,394 --> 01:08:58,555
[SPEAKER_02]: But here's going to be the argument, and I'm sure a lot of people in chat are going to make this.

884
01:08:59,015 --> 01:09:03,397
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of games, they have the support for playing with a GameCube controller.

885
01:09:03,897 --> 01:09:21,364
[SPEAKER_02]: for example, Smash Brothers or Mario Kart and that kind of stuff and a lot of people refer the GameCube controller or WaveBird or whatever to the Wii Remote steering and that kind of bullshit that they have so that's what a lot of people are probably pissed off about because they don't want to use the classic controller I'll give you that

886
01:09:24,788 --> 01:09:34,803
[SPEAKER_02]: All they would have to do is create some sort of WaveBird thing that plugs you into either wirelessly or tethered to the Wii Remote.

887
01:09:35,123 --> 01:09:36,205
[SPEAKER_02]: And boom, everyone's happy.

888
01:09:36,943 --> 01:09:41,565
[SPEAKER_10]: But the audience that needs something like that is probably not the same audience that this console is geared at.

889
01:09:41,645 --> 01:09:46,586
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, this is really about getting the Wiis into homes that don't already have them, which aren't a lot by now.

890
01:09:47,466 --> 01:09:47,687
[SPEAKER_10]: Right?

891
01:09:47,967 --> 01:09:49,327
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is only coming out in Europe again.

892
01:09:50,267 --> 01:09:51,868
[SPEAKER_10]: At least they say it's not coming out here.

893
01:09:52,528 --> 01:09:54,889
[SPEAKER_10]: I still say PAX next week could change a lot of things.

894
01:09:55,469 --> 01:09:58,650
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'll go with it and say that it's only probably coming out in Europe right now.

895
01:09:59,110 --> 01:09:59,290
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

896
01:09:59,831 --> 01:10:00,371
[SPEAKER_02]: As of right now.

897
01:10:00,931 --> 01:10:01,091
[SPEAKER_10]: So...

898
01:10:03,647 --> 01:10:14,203
[SPEAKER_10]: but yeah I mean the GameCube compatibility thing probably isn't too surprising do you think that maybe you know since we talked earlier in the show about hacking and stuff that they've tried to take measures to combat all that

899
01:10:16,022 --> 01:10:17,483
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, no.

900
01:10:18,644 --> 01:10:20,565
[SPEAKER_02]: But here's something interesting, though.

901
01:10:21,525 --> 01:10:35,793
[SPEAKER_02]: They're basically saying other bundles will also be forthcoming, and they also got word that Nintendo will focus on the new Wii bundles going forward, suggesting it won't coexist with the current model.

902
01:10:37,685 --> 01:10:42,506
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're going to be removing it out of all of the systems going forward.

903
01:10:43,286 --> 01:10:45,527
[SPEAKER_10]: They already did and they didn't even make better graphics.

904
01:10:45,547 --> 01:10:46,027
[SPEAKER_10]: They just put Wii...

905
01:11:05,871 --> 01:11:06,751
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, controls in there.

906
01:11:06,771 --> 01:11:08,112
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember new play control stuff?

907
01:11:08,352 --> 01:11:09,512
[SPEAKER_02]: That didn't sell very well.

908
01:11:09,532 --> 01:11:10,772
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why you don't see them anymore.

909
01:11:10,852 --> 01:11:17,454
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to go a step further and say when the Wii U virtual console stuff hits, you're probably going to start seeing some of the GameCube stuff pop up on there.

910
01:11:17,774 --> 01:11:21,375
[SPEAKER_10]: And then maybe that's why they're starting to try and phase GameCube accessibility out.

911
01:11:21,495 --> 01:11:24,716
[SPEAKER_10]: But Breakman has a really good point in chat room, and I kind of agree with this.

912
01:11:24,736 --> 01:11:26,717
[SPEAKER_10]: The original GameCube is one of the sturdiest systems.

913
01:11:27,137 --> 01:11:29,037
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, those GameCubes are kind of hard to break.

914
01:11:29,457 --> 01:11:31,738
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't know anybody that ever had a broken GameCube.

915
01:11:32,318 --> 01:11:32,759
[SPEAKER_08]: The disc's not so much.

916
01:11:50,276 --> 01:11:50,916
[SPEAKER_10]: So, anyhow.

917
01:11:51,516 --> 01:11:52,797
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, well, there you go.

918
01:11:52,857 --> 01:11:55,657
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess a new Wii for the three people that don't have one yet.

919
01:11:56,337 --> 01:11:59,678
[SPEAKER_10]: Meanwhile, who knows of a game called Steel Battalion?

920
01:12:00,338 --> 01:12:01,019
[SPEAKER_10]: I do.

921
01:12:01,379 --> 01:12:03,999
[SPEAKER_10]: Tell the listeners what Steel Battalion is, if they've never heard of it.

922
01:12:04,299 --> 01:12:10,001
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a huge war sim where you're a mecha, and it has this huge mongus controller, of which we have two now.

923
01:12:11,442 --> 01:12:14,146
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, and when the controller came out it was like 300 bucks.

924
01:12:14,486 --> 01:12:15,047
[SPEAKER_10]: It was expensive.

925
01:12:15,067 --> 01:12:18,231
[SPEAKER_10]: Because the controller was literally a dynamic, it was a console.

926
01:12:18,271 --> 01:12:20,875
[SPEAKER_08]: It was panels and switches and the red button.

927
01:12:21,035 --> 01:12:23,439
[SPEAKER_10]: It was like what you would see inside an actual mech.

928
01:12:23,519 --> 01:12:24,520
[SPEAKER_10]: It was pretty crazy.

929
01:12:24,641 --> 01:12:25,061
[SPEAKER_08]: It was.

930
01:12:25,221 --> 01:12:26,303
[SPEAKER_08]: It was crazy go nuts.

931
01:12:26,383 --> 01:12:26,864
[SPEAKER_10]: Heavy Armor

932
01:12:44,944 --> 01:12:49,368
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently, you will be able to use Kinect and the standard Xbox 360 controller.

933
01:12:49,709 --> 01:12:59,840
[SPEAKER_10]: The controller will be used for movement, aiming, and firing, but the Kinect camera will use upper body gestures that you can use to start the engine, use a turret gun, use the scope.

934
01:13:00,160 --> 01:13:03,564
[SPEAKER_10]: You can communicate verbally with the crew members if you want as well.

935
01:13:03,844 --> 01:13:06,327
[SPEAKER_10]: They talk specifically in the release about

936
01:13:06,627 --> 01:13:07,407
[SPEAKER_10]: High fives.

937
01:13:08,868 --> 01:13:18,193
[SPEAKER_10]: So it sounds like they're bringing all these buttons and things that do stuff into a whole new realm, which sounds funny to me.

938
01:13:18,273 --> 01:13:18,573
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

939
01:13:18,593 --> 01:13:19,493
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's going to be fun.

940
01:13:19,653 --> 01:13:26,597
[SPEAKER_08]: But honestly, the fun I think of the original was you had all the buttons and all the neat little stuff to push.

941
01:13:27,150 --> 01:13:28,591
[SPEAKER_10]: My favorite was the eject button.

942
01:13:28,611 --> 01:13:30,292
[SPEAKER_10]: I like to just push that button for fun.

943
01:13:30,893 --> 01:13:39,779
[SPEAKER_08]: But it was the fact that instead of moving your hand or doing something, you got to push the damn button.

944
01:13:39,879 --> 01:13:43,961
[SPEAKER_08]: Wasn't that the fun of it that you had the whole console there?

945
01:13:43,981 --> 01:13:44,902
[SPEAKER_10]: That's true.

946
01:13:44,962 --> 01:13:46,623
[SPEAKER_10]: I do like to push buttons.

947
01:13:46,663 --> 01:13:51,426
[SPEAKER_10]: They need to release a peripheral for the Kinect that's just a board with buttons on it that I can push.

948
01:13:51,606 --> 01:13:52,387
[SPEAKER_08]: Bubble wrap the game.

949
01:13:52,407 --> 01:13:52,847
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

950
01:13:55,257 --> 01:13:55,917
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, wait, wait, wait.

951
01:13:55,977 --> 01:13:58,978
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't need buttons anymore because I have the Kinect, and that's what it's all about.

952
01:13:59,259 --> 01:14:00,319
[SPEAKER_08]: I like my buttons.

953
01:14:01,960 --> 01:14:02,720
[SPEAKER_10]: I like the buttons.

954
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:04,701
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to push the red one.

955
01:14:05,261 --> 01:14:05,841
[SPEAKER_08]: I push it.

956
01:14:06,541 --> 01:14:08,742
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, let's get to the classic game of the week.

957
01:14:10,663 --> 01:14:19,306
[SPEAKER_10]: Every week here on the program, DarkSakura dives into the gaming vault and says, Hey, back in my day, we pushed a lot of buttons, and you're going to be pushing my buttons if you don't try this game.

958
01:14:19,346 --> 01:14:20,527
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the classic game of the week.

959
01:14:20,547 --> 01:14:23,528
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, what did you pick as the classic game of the week?

960
01:14:24,241 --> 01:14:26,362
[SPEAKER_08]: The classic game of the week is Midnight Resistance.

961
01:14:26,882 --> 01:14:28,322
[SPEAKER_08]: Woo, we can all thank Dan for this.

962
01:14:28,342 --> 01:14:30,102
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I was like, Dan, help me think of a game.

963
01:14:30,843 --> 01:14:31,683
[SPEAKER_08]: Midnight Resistance.

964
01:14:31,963 --> 01:14:32,283
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

965
01:14:33,303 --> 01:14:44,886
[SPEAKER_08]: So it is a side-scrolling action shooting game that Data East put out in the arcade in 1989 and came out on the Mega Drive, also known as the Genesis, in 1990.

966
01:14:45,106 --> 01:14:47,747
[SPEAKER_08]: It was put out by Ocean Software US.

967
01:14:48,507 --> 01:14:51,368
[SPEAKER_08]: It is in the future where everything sucks.

968
01:14:52,268 --> 01:15:03,215
[SPEAKER_08]: and you're a member of a resistance movement dude who has to rescue his family from a mad scientist before he turns them into donkeys or something.

969
01:15:03,235 --> 01:15:03,616
[SPEAKER_08]: Not really.

970
01:15:04,977 --> 01:15:05,257
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway.

971
01:15:05,377 --> 01:15:07,078
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically it's Contra but not.

972
01:15:07,338 --> 01:15:08,739
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's Contra but not.

973
01:15:09,239 --> 01:15:11,301
[SPEAKER_08]: And you can do two players simultaneous.

974
01:15:12,802 --> 01:15:13,323
[SPEAKER_08]: Nantra.

975
01:15:14,284 --> 01:15:19,150
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, that's what Loki said without talking to his mic.

976
01:15:20,192 --> 01:15:29,584
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyway, it had a rotatable joystick that's like the one used in Ikari Warriors, which is why this is a hard game to emulate unless you've got an arcade controller.

977
01:15:31,426 --> 01:15:40,694
[SPEAKER_08]: At any rate, you also had your shoots and jumps and you would use your little dial to adjust your aim as you went along.

978
01:15:42,976 --> 01:15:46,740
[SPEAKER_08]: So you could keep moving in directions but change your aim.

979
01:15:46,820 --> 01:15:47,481
[SPEAKER_08]: It was pretty neat.

980
01:15:48,241 --> 01:15:52,686
[SPEAKER_08]: And it had a power-up system that was like a heavy barrel, which was also a Data East game.

981
01:15:53,426 --> 01:16:03,011
[SPEAKER_08]: where you would collect keys after defeating enemies and you'd get six keys at a time and then you could enter weapon storage and pick out different weapons and power-ups and stuff.

982
01:16:04,171 --> 01:16:18,898
[SPEAKER_08]: Your main weapons that you could get were... You could replace your default rifle with backpack weapons that are launched so you'd actually push the joystick and press the shoot button to do it at the same time.

983
01:16:20,059 --> 01:16:21,200
[SPEAKER_08]: You had different special guns.

984
01:16:21,220 --> 01:16:24,343
[SPEAKER_08]: You had a supercharge upgrade that would increase your firepower.

985
01:16:24,983 --> 01:16:29,408
[SPEAKER_08]: And a barrier that gives you invincibility temporarily and extra lives.

986
01:16:29,428 --> 01:16:31,570
[SPEAKER_08]: There's nine stages with different obstacles.

987
01:16:32,030 --> 01:16:36,234
[SPEAKER_08]: And right before the final stages, you use your keys.

988
01:16:36,755 --> 01:16:39,777
[SPEAKER_08]: But you have to battle the Crimson King.

989
01:16:40,378 --> 01:16:43,321
[SPEAKER_08]: And the ending depends on how many of your family members you rescued.

990
01:16:44,927 --> 01:16:45,908
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, it came out for home.

991
01:16:47,449 --> 01:16:53,655
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I said, it was published by Data East for the Mega Drive in Japan.

992
01:16:54,496 --> 01:17:04,345
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's very close to the arcade version, except, of course, the controllers, since it's just a Genesis pad, you couldn't have the rotatable thing, so you had four different button configurations.

993
01:17:05,426 --> 01:17:07,268
[SPEAKER_08]: Your default controllers will let you...

994
01:17:09,970 --> 01:17:10,230
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck yes.

995
01:17:10,370 --> 01:17:10,830
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck yes.

996
01:17:28,857 --> 01:17:31,138
[SPEAKER_08]: I had a feeling that you were familiar with this game, Rob.

997
01:17:31,158 --> 01:17:33,978
[SPEAKER_10]: How in the fuck you did this game on the Commodore 64, I have no idea.

998
01:17:35,039 --> 01:17:36,179
[SPEAKER_10]: Can I look up a YouTube of that?

999
01:17:36,219 --> 01:17:37,339
[SPEAKER_10]: I gotta see this on the C64.

1000
01:17:37,359 --> 01:17:43,061
[SPEAKER_08]: There's the ZX Spectrum, the Amstrad CPC, Commodore Amiga, and the Atari ST.

1001
01:17:44,541 --> 01:17:46,041
[SPEAKER_08]: Some development done by Special FX.

1002
01:17:46,942 --> 01:17:55,764
[SPEAKER_08]: And actually, one thing, Rob, is that this is listed as one of the greatest games ever made for that system.

1003
01:17:57,714 --> 01:17:58,855
[SPEAKER_10]: Go back and play the previous one.

1004
01:18:19,335 --> 01:18:20,076
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, the actual music?

1005
01:18:20,416 --> 01:18:22,098
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, just to... Sure, sure, sure.

1006
01:18:22,658 --> 01:18:23,379
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me jump in here.

1007
01:18:23,399 --> 01:18:25,361
[SPEAKER_08]: So you see, it's... I think it's pretty playful.

1008
01:18:25,381 --> 01:18:25,801
Yeah, yeah.

1009
01:18:32,602 --> 01:18:37,224
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, for the Spectrum, by the way, it was completely redesigned and done really cartoony.

1010
01:18:38,405 --> 01:18:46,348
[SPEAKER_08]: And it had push-screen scrolling and very few colors, but it's considered to be one of the best games on the system.

1011
01:18:47,568 --> 01:18:48,169
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's it.

1012
01:18:48,209 --> 01:18:49,049
[SPEAKER_08]: That's Midnight Resistance.

1013
01:18:50,333 --> 01:18:52,154
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week.

1014
01:18:52,354 --> 01:18:56,216
[SPEAKER_10]: Midnight Resistance for the, what system specifically?

1015
01:18:56,236 --> 01:18:56,376
[SPEAKER_10]: Arcade?

1016
01:18:56,436 --> 01:18:59,138
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm talking about Arcade, but we'll also include the home releases.

1017
01:18:59,298 --> 01:19:03,760
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, so the Arcade slash Mega Drive slash C64 slash... Other stuff.

1018
01:19:03,860 --> 01:19:04,921
[SPEAKER_08]: A bunch of British systems.

1019
01:19:05,121 --> 01:19:05,701
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, there you go.

1020
01:19:06,521 --> 01:19:07,322
[SPEAKER_10]: Your classic game of the week.

1021
01:19:07,842 --> 01:19:08,263
[SPEAKER_10]: Good pick.

1022
01:19:08,643 --> 01:19:11,446
[SPEAKER_10]: I've actually not heard of that game, but it looks kind of interesting.

1023
01:19:12,707 --> 01:19:14,589
[SPEAKER_10]: Here I thought I knew every game that was on the Commodore 64.

1024
01:19:14,729 --> 01:19:20,335
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why I thought you would be very interested, because Lotted is one of the best games for the Commodore 64.

1025
01:19:20,876 --> 01:19:26,922
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, every fucking game that was released in the 80s in the arcades came out on the Commodore 64 at some point.

1026
01:19:26,942 --> 01:19:28,424
[SPEAKER_10]: You have to give it a go.

1027
01:19:28,544 --> 01:19:30,246
[SPEAKER_10]: There was a lot of games on Commodore 64, I'm telling you.

1028
01:19:30,771 --> 01:19:34,533
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to take a quick break, guys, but we'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio after this.

1029
01:19:34,853 --> 01:19:35,394
[SPEAKER_10]: Stay tuned.

1030
01:19:35,434 --> 01:19:43,498
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, we've got more information on VidRhythm, Harmonix's next project we're going to talk about in the next segment, as well as Diablo 3 and some of the rumors with that.

1031
01:19:43,759 --> 01:19:49,282
[SPEAKER_10]: And then, of course, your calls, your tweets, and much more when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1032
01:19:55,290 --> 01:19:57,811
[SPEAKER_10]: Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

1033
01:20:11,315 --> 01:20:14,938
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know about you guys, but I think that's pretty awesome

1034
01:20:36,815 --> 01:20:37,295
[SPEAKER_10]: Luminous 2 Luminous 3

1035
01:20:57,032 --> 01:21:03,156
[SPEAKER_10]: I really liked... Well, I had a Missy Elliott song and a Beck song.

1036
01:21:03,336 --> 01:21:03,877
[SPEAKER_08]: The first one.

1037
01:21:03,897 --> 01:21:07,139
[SPEAKER_08]: I was going to say, my favorite, though, is still the first one.

1038
01:21:07,459 --> 01:21:08,960
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's fair.

1039
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:11,002
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's probably better.

1040
01:21:11,142 --> 01:21:13,363
[SPEAKER_10]: Both of them are probably better than the Xbox One, in my opinion.

1041
01:21:13,943 --> 01:21:17,266
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just the controller on the Xbox Two is so... Oh, yeah.

1042
01:21:17,886 --> 01:21:18,286
[SPEAKER_10]: It's rough.

1043
01:21:19,187 --> 01:21:23,590
[SPEAKER_10]: Still surprised to this day they have never tried to really correct the Xbox 360 D-pad.

1044
01:21:23,910 --> 01:21:24,851
[SPEAKER_10]: In this country, anyway.

1045
01:21:24,871 --> 01:21:24,951
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1046
01:21:25,191 --> 01:21:29,236
[SPEAKER_02]: Other than selling it as a premium monochrome controller that, you know.

1047
01:21:29,296 --> 01:21:30,397
[SPEAKER_10]: Wasn't that only available in Europe?

1048
01:21:30,417 --> 01:21:31,559
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it's over here.

1049
01:21:31,859 --> 01:21:32,079
[SPEAKER_10]: Really?

1050
01:21:32,119 --> 01:21:32,500
[SPEAKER_10]: Was it really?

1051
01:21:32,540 --> 01:21:33,521
[SPEAKER_02]: They still sell it today.

1052
01:21:33,821 --> 01:21:34,082
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

1053
01:21:34,162 --> 01:21:36,665
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more expensive than the regular controller.

1054
01:21:36,685 --> 01:21:37,145
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.

1055
01:21:37,365 --> 01:21:37,746
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course.

1056
01:21:38,407 --> 01:21:38,627
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1057
01:21:38,647 --> 01:21:40,930
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, let's get into some rapid fire news.

1058
01:21:40,990 --> 01:21:42,772
[SPEAKER_10]: Some quick, quick news stories for you guys.

1059
01:21:43,333 --> 01:21:45,035
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're going to cover quite a bit here.

1060
01:21:45,135 --> 01:21:45,355
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki.

1061
01:21:46,024 --> 01:21:46,625
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, guess what?

1062
01:21:46,645 --> 01:21:53,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo announced the launch of their largest title for the Wii, maybe even to date.

1063
01:21:54,911 --> 01:21:58,554
[SPEAKER_02]: Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword will be out in North America November 20th.

1064
01:21:58,574 --> 01:22:00,496
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can mark that down.

1065
01:22:00,556 --> 01:22:01,496
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that is holiday.

1066
01:22:01,997 --> 01:22:08,182
[SPEAKER_02]: And, of course, it will require Motion Plus, which, you know, God, by now you probably have something that's Motion Plus.

1067
01:22:08,302 --> 01:22:10,003
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, I still don't have a Motion Plus.

1068
01:22:10,063 --> 01:22:10,584
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that sad?

1069
01:22:10,624 --> 01:22:12,025
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you're going to play the game then.

1070
01:22:13,869 --> 01:22:15,891
[SPEAKER_02]: Go buy Wii Party Motion or something like that.

1071
01:22:16,211 --> 01:22:18,513
[SPEAKER_02]: Get a free crappy game with Thermo.

1072
01:22:22,202 --> 01:22:22,942
[SPEAKER_02]: This is kind of cool.

1073
01:22:23,462 --> 01:22:28,064
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some portal turrets coming to Bastion on Steam.

1074
01:22:28,584 --> 01:22:28,865
[SPEAKER_07]: Really?

1075
01:22:29,245 --> 01:22:29,505
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1076
01:22:29,865 --> 01:22:32,946
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently they've got some cool stuff.

1077
01:22:34,066 --> 01:22:46,071
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a quest exclusive for the Steam version of Bastion where the kid uses a gel canister marked with the Aperture Science logo that contains a vicious substance of unknown origin.

1078
01:22:46,971 --> 01:22:55,215
[SPEAKER_02]: and if you use that friendly portal turrets will come into battle and they will shoot enemies for you.

1079
01:22:55,355 --> 01:23:00,237
[SPEAKER_10]: Bobby actually sent me a YouTube of this earlier in the night so I don't know if this is going to have narration in it.

1080
01:23:00,257 --> 01:23:01,377
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me try to play this YouTube.

1081
01:23:01,838 --> 01:23:02,658
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the narrator.

1082
01:23:06,633 --> 01:23:07,734
[SPEAKER_10]: So, let's see.

1083
01:23:07,754 --> 01:23:09,796
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah, there's the turrets.

1084
01:23:09,956 --> 01:23:10,637
[SPEAKER_10]: Are they talking?

1085
01:23:10,657 --> 01:23:10,837
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1086
01:23:10,877 --> 01:23:11,438
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fantastic.

1087
01:23:32,250 --> 01:23:33,692
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's not in the 360 version.

1088
01:23:37,138 --> 01:23:38,000
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah, they're talking.

1089
01:23:38,140 --> 01:23:38,561
[SPEAKER_10]: That's cool.

1090
01:23:42,106 --> 01:23:44,931
[SPEAKER_05]: Scumbags don't take kindly to interlopers.

1091
01:23:52,102 --> 01:23:53,522
[SPEAKER_10]: Now they're all over on this screen.

1092
01:23:53,962 --> 01:23:54,743
[SPEAKER_10]: It's pretty cool.

1093
01:23:58,843 --> 01:24:02,244
[SPEAKER_10]: I think they're kind of patching different parts of the game together.

1094
01:24:02,664 --> 01:24:03,845
[SPEAKER_10]: The music's great in this game.

1095
01:24:04,105 --> 01:24:04,725
[SPEAKER_10]: I like this game.

1096
01:24:05,405 --> 01:24:07,705
[SPEAKER_10]: It's part of the reason I'm pissed my Xbox got hacked.

1097
01:24:08,045 --> 01:24:09,126
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd like to be playing this right now.

1098
01:24:09,206 --> 01:24:10,146
[SPEAKER_09]: So there you go.

1099
01:24:10,166 --> 01:24:11,146
[SPEAKER_10]: Clip from Bastion plus Portal.

1100
01:24:20,191 --> 01:24:20,511
[SPEAKER_02]: Boobz

1101
01:24:37,567 --> 01:24:51,287
[SPEAKER_10]: I was talking about 3D websites and how they need websites with boobs I remember talking about this and Bobby said he was going to go make the website even it was like 3dboobies.com or something I don't remember what we called it I swear this came up like last week on the show

1102
01:24:51,812 --> 01:25:13,322
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, apparently, the Half-Minute Hero designer, Kenny Chiro Takaki, he has set out to create a 3DS game based on, I guess, I don't know if it's an anime or whatever, but anyways, it's called Senran Kaguru, or Kagura, I'm sorry.

1103
01:25:13,342 --> 01:25:13,422
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1104
01:25:13,742 --> 01:25:18,946
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's basically female ninjas with giant breasts.

1105
01:25:19,947 --> 01:25:23,849
[SPEAKER_02]: And the game will be on sale in Japan September 22nd.

1106
01:25:24,670 --> 01:25:26,591
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't plan on seeing that coming out over here.

1107
01:25:26,691 --> 01:25:31,014
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, they've got a trailer for it.

1108
01:25:31,254 --> 01:25:34,116
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't really show too much.

1109
01:25:34,156 --> 01:25:36,718
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's just kind of this anime intro thing.

1110
01:25:37,339 --> 01:25:37,759
[SPEAKER_02]: And then...

1111
01:25:39,680 --> 01:25:52,828
[SPEAKER_02]: and lots of innuendo, like all of them sucking on stuff right now and large boobs and she's pulling out stuff from her boobs and yeah, lots of breasts.

1112
01:25:53,608 --> 01:25:55,710
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and panty shot.

1113
01:25:58,611 --> 01:25:59,972
[SPEAKER_10]: You say this like it's a bad thing.

1114
01:26:00,032 --> 01:26:02,994
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, this is really what people want a 3DS for, right?

1115
01:26:03,714 --> 01:26:04,595
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's welcomed.

1116
01:26:06,334 --> 01:26:08,855
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, let's move on to some other news.

1117
01:26:08,875 --> 01:26:11,217
[SPEAKER_10]: This has to do with a game coming to PlayStation Network.

1118
01:26:11,237 --> 01:26:15,119
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a revival of an old arcade game, Elevator Action Deluxe.

1119
01:26:15,999 --> 01:26:19,321
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, apparently there's a new PlayStation Network version.

1120
01:26:19,381 --> 01:26:21,322
[SPEAKER_10]: It's an HD update of the old game.

1121
01:26:21,922 --> 01:26:23,763
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if you've ever played this game.

1122
01:26:23,803 --> 01:26:27,005
[SPEAKER_10]: If you have the original Elevator Deluxe, look up some of the clips on YouTube.

1123
01:26:27,045 --> 01:26:27,985
[SPEAKER_10]: I know it was on the NES.

1124
01:26:28,065 --> 01:26:32,968
[SPEAKER_10]: It was very popular back in the day, so I'm sure you guys probably will recognize this when you see some YouTubes of it.

1125
01:26:33,468 --> 01:26:58,717
[SPEAKER_10]: but the new version on PlayStation Network of course not just an HD you know upgrade and so forth but there's going to be new new weapons faster elevators multiplayer modes that are available offline including deathmatch and other competitive modes so that'll be kind of neat I guess ten dollars for that I don't know I always kind of thought elevator action was overrated I did not think it was that great of a game as far as like classic games go I think it's one of the uh

1126
01:26:59,796 --> 01:27:00,696
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm With The Chili Peppers

1127
01:27:20,922 --> 01:27:21,542
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, why not?

1128
01:27:21,562 --> 01:27:22,443
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll just do all the songs.

1129
01:27:22,603 --> 01:27:32,108
[SPEAKER_10]: By the way, Californication, Look Around, Monarchy of Roses, Other Side, Parallel Universe, Scar Tissue, and The Adventures of Rain Dance Maggie.

1130
01:27:32,808 --> 01:27:38,031
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, the usual rock band pricing of $1.99 on the Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3.

1131
01:27:38,451 --> 01:27:39,572
[SPEAKER_10]: August 30th is when it's going to come out.

1132
01:27:39,852 --> 01:27:46,075
[SPEAKER_10]: Keep in mind, if the Red Hot Chili Pepper song you were hoping for wasn't in that list, there's already quite a few in the main game.

1133
01:27:46,135 --> 01:27:49,137
[SPEAKER_10]: So you'd better check the master song lists.

1134
01:27:50,353 --> 01:27:50,853
[SPEAKER_10]: Matt Black

1135
01:28:10,103 --> 01:28:11,544
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see you next time.

1136
01:28:30,493 --> 01:28:36,538
[SPEAKER_10]: Those will be making their way to retailers over the coming weeks, and certainly if you're getting one of these for the holiday, you'll probably have one of those with the matte finish.

1137
01:28:37,339 --> 01:28:39,180
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

1138
01:28:39,561 --> 01:28:39,941
[SPEAKER_08]: Stuff.

1139
01:28:41,042 --> 01:28:49,549
[SPEAKER_08]: Mega Man X2 actually has been given an ESRB rating for the Wii, so meaning that we should have it on the Virtual Console at some point, and it's E for everyone.

1140
01:28:50,169 --> 01:28:50,349
[SPEAKER_06]: Aww.

1141
01:28:51,730 --> 01:28:53,652
[SPEAKER_08]: You know that's the one that has the Shoryuken in it, right?

1142
01:28:55,732 --> 01:29:08,464
[SPEAKER_08]: and for 3DS, Tekken 3D Prime Edition is actually going to come with apparently it's going to come with Blood Vengeance which is that movie.

1143
01:29:08,484 --> 01:29:12,087
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be included on the cartridge.

1144
01:29:13,148 --> 01:29:14,570
[SPEAKER_08]: So that sounds like it'll be cool.

1145
01:29:14,590 --> 01:29:20,075
[SPEAKER_08]: So you're actually going to be watching something and it's part of the PS3 bundle for the record which I really want to see it.

1146
01:29:20,855 --> 01:29:24,319
[SPEAKER_08]: and then, last but not least, LittleBigPlanet 2 Move Pack.

1147
01:29:24,439 --> 01:29:26,040
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's what's going to be in it.

1148
01:29:26,681 --> 01:29:39,153
[SPEAKER_08]: It has a brand new story for LittleBigPlanet 2 called The Rise of the Cakeling, five levels, seven minigames, two cutscenes, a new power-up for Sackboy called the Brain Crane, three move gadgets, the Moveinator, the Move Recorder, and the Paint Tool.

1149
01:29:40,354 --> 01:29:59,905
[SPEAKER_08]: Four interactive music tracks, eight music sequencer tracks, a new sound object containing 32 new sounds, 17 new music sequencer instruments, a new level background, six new costumes, 18 materials, 41 decorations, 31 objects, 66 stickers, 39 new LittleBigPlanet pins, 11 brand new PlayStation trophies, and a partridge in a pear tree.

1150
01:30:00,485 --> 01:30:02,927
[SPEAKER_08]: No price yet, but it will be out on September 14th.

1151
01:30:04,483 --> 01:30:06,184
[SPEAKER_10]: I still need to buy LittleBigPlanet 2.

1152
01:30:06,244 --> 01:30:06,944
[SPEAKER_10]: Isn't that sad?

1153
01:30:07,524 --> 01:30:08,125
[SPEAKER_10]: Rob!

1154
01:30:08,445 --> 01:30:09,445
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I keep waiting.

1155
01:30:09,505 --> 01:30:11,546
[SPEAKER_10]: I keep holding out for a price reduction.

1156
01:30:11,626 --> 01:30:13,507
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, you do the retail thing.

1157
01:30:13,547 --> 01:30:18,410
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you think there'll be one that has the move crap bundled in with it for a cheaper price?

1158
01:30:18,950 --> 01:30:22,271
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll do probably... Well, they did with the first one, a Game of the Year edition.

1159
01:30:22,291 --> 01:30:23,332
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, that's what I'm waiting for.

1160
01:30:25,309 --> 01:30:36,033
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that's going to happen this year, though, because it's... Last one came out a year after the first one came out, and I believe... What's the little big planet, too?

1161
01:30:36,053 --> 01:30:36,674
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that this year?

1162
01:30:36,834 --> 01:30:37,834
[SPEAKER_02]: That was January, I think.

1163
01:30:38,735 --> 01:30:39,395
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that last year?

1164
01:30:39,815 --> 01:30:42,176
[SPEAKER_10]: It was... I think it had been pushed to this year.

1165
01:30:42,196 --> 01:30:42,756
[SPEAKER_02]: That was this year.

1166
01:30:42,937 --> 01:30:43,497
[SPEAKER_02]: It was this year.

1167
01:30:43,537 --> 01:30:44,237
[SPEAKER_02]: Early this year.

1168
01:30:45,298 --> 01:30:50,220
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, I don't think that we're going to see that any cheaper.

1169
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:52,241
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it may price drop a little bit, but...

1170
01:30:54,382 --> 01:30:55,343
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be a while.

1171
01:30:57,265 --> 01:30:58,066
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, fine.

1172
01:30:58,126 --> 01:31:01,189
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably when they have some more content packs for it.

1173
01:31:01,509 --> 01:31:01,950
[SPEAKER_02]: Fine.

1174
01:31:02,190 --> 01:31:02,510
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

1175
01:31:02,990 --> 01:31:04,051
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, let's move on.

1176
01:31:04,072 --> 01:31:07,194
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to get back into some longer news and pretty soon the Skype line.

1177
01:31:07,535 --> 01:31:12,940
[SPEAKER_10]: But first, I want to make sure I get at least one more plug in because we might be starting this segment when we get back.

1178
01:31:12,980 --> 01:31:15,502
[SPEAKER_10]: It depends if I can get this particular people on the show or not.

1179
01:31:15,562 --> 01:31:16,143
[SPEAKER_10]: But we

1180
01:31:16,203 --> 01:31:24,310
[SPEAKER_10]: We are, again, trying very hard to feature indie games on the show and are hoping to begin that around the Labor Day show, which will be, of course, the show when we get back.

1181
01:31:25,331 --> 01:31:39,103
[SPEAKER_10]: If you are an indie developer yourself or you know someone who's an indie developer who needs help getting the word out on the game and you think the game is unique and special and needs a little help standing out in the Xbox Live marketplace, since Microsoft won't help you, we will.

1182
01:31:39,923 --> 01:32:05,009
[SPEAKER_10]: or even if it's an iOS game or a PC game or wherever it is drop me an email rob at orangelaunchradio.com that's me personally or you can always email the show if you'd rather mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com and we will try to get to your game to feature it as an indie game on the show and even if we don't get a lot of bite on that we're probably just going to start the spotlights very soon so look forward to that

1183
01:32:05,731 --> 01:32:06,252
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura.com

1184
01:32:26,229 --> 01:32:30,912
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura will be back with a second podcast hopefully very soon, something I'm joining her with.

1185
01:32:31,353 --> 01:32:31,513
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1186
01:32:31,913 --> 01:32:38,797
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, Labor Day-ish once all this stuff settles because there's a lot going on personal life for Jamie and Dan right now.

1187
01:32:39,237 --> 01:32:40,838
[SPEAKER_08]: Real life is intruding violently.

1188
01:32:41,019 --> 01:32:43,260
[SPEAKER_10]: We had to delay it a little bit, but it's still on the radar.

1189
01:32:43,400 --> 01:32:44,741
[SPEAKER_10]: So sorry we keep announcing.

1190
01:32:44,781 --> 01:32:47,803
[SPEAKER_10]: We've been announcing that for like six weeks now, but things happen.

1191
01:32:47,963 --> 01:32:50,104
[SPEAKER_08]: But we've got like show roles and everything and stuff ready.

1192
01:32:50,264 --> 01:32:50,765
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, I know.

1193
01:32:51,365 --> 01:32:52,225
[SPEAKER_10]: We know what we're doing.

1194
01:32:52,286 --> 01:32:52,866
[SPEAKER_10]: We're ready to go.

1195
01:32:52,926 --> 01:32:54,147
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just a matter of doing it.

1196
01:32:54,247 --> 01:32:54,387
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1197
01:32:54,987 --> 01:32:56,108
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, let's move on.

1198
01:32:56,168 --> 01:32:57,428
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's get into some longer news.

1199
01:32:57,468 --> 01:32:57,709
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki.

1200
01:32:58,889 --> 01:33:02,491
[SPEAKER_02]: This is kind of creepy and interesting at the same time, I guess.

1201
01:33:02,871 --> 01:33:06,153
[SPEAKER_02]: GameStop has been testing a console streaming service.

1202
01:33:07,414 --> 01:33:10,695
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, they're hoping to have a beta in place by the end of this year.

1203
01:33:11,836 --> 01:33:22,281
[SPEAKER_02]: And right now, I mean, this shouldn't be a huge surprise because they bought a company called Spawn Labs, which they had their own game streaming box.

1204
01:33:22,821 --> 01:33:23,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically,

1205
01:33:24,683 --> 01:33:35,676
[SPEAKER_02]: this would stream console games so Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 games to smart devices and dedicated hardware and they're also tinkering with PC game streaming as well

1206
01:33:37,583 --> 01:33:39,064
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, that's kind of creepy.

1207
01:33:40,965 --> 01:33:50,852
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess this will be a service for people that are GameStop Power-Up Rewards members, and that demos will be provided.

1208
01:33:51,652 --> 01:34:03,980
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, the rest of the stuff, including pricing, is not known, and they're expected to have a full rollout by early next year, or I guess more details about early next year and a full rollout by middle of 2012.

1209
01:34:06,786 --> 01:34:07,567
[SPEAKER_02]: It's interesting.

1210
01:34:08,907 --> 01:34:15,972
[SPEAKER_10]: Eh, I don't care because it's GameStop and I already told you my feelings on them a few weeks ago and if you missed that whole little rant, I am boycotting them because I think they're a shitty company.

1211
01:34:16,412 --> 01:34:18,454
[SPEAKER_10]: So I kind of don't care about this whole thing.

1212
01:34:19,834 --> 01:34:23,677
[SPEAKER_10]: However, let me think of something nice I could say about this.

1213
01:34:24,497 --> 01:34:32,362
[SPEAKER_10]: Competition is healthy and so these places like OnLive and so forth that are already offering something very similar, right?

1214
01:34:33,363 --> 01:34:34,684
[SPEAKER_10]: The competition is a healthy thing.

1215
01:34:37,069 --> 01:34:38,450
[SPEAKER_02]: This is GameStop you're talking about.

1216
01:34:38,531 --> 01:34:41,153
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the monkey that's in the corner.

1217
01:34:41,633 --> 01:34:43,115
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically the elephant in the room there.

1218
01:34:43,835 --> 01:34:46,398
[SPEAKER_08]: They're the biggest... The monkey in the corner throwing poo at itself?

1219
01:34:46,718 --> 01:34:47,198
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, whatever.

1220
01:34:47,479 --> 01:34:52,303
[SPEAKER_02]: They're the biggest retailer for video games out there in the marketplace right now.

1221
01:34:52,343 --> 01:34:55,066
[SPEAKER_02]: They dictate to publishers what they do.

1222
01:34:55,966 --> 01:34:57,448
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkDeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1223
01:35:14,527 --> 01:35:15,568
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what's going to be coming.

1224
01:35:15,868 --> 01:35:18,189
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be disgusting.

1225
01:35:18,729 --> 01:35:22,470
[SPEAKER_10]: By the way, that right there, just add that to the list.

1226
01:35:22,730 --> 01:35:27,572
[SPEAKER_10]: If you are new to OLR, and I know we have a lot of people that work at GameStops and stuff like that.

1227
01:35:27,652 --> 01:35:29,172
[SPEAKER_10]: My beef is not with the workers.

1228
01:35:29,672 --> 01:35:34,354
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys have a thankless job, and I respect what you've got to do to pay the bills.

1229
01:35:34,514 --> 01:35:36,495
[SPEAKER_10]: My problem is with the management of the company.

1230
01:35:36,535 --> 01:35:36,995
[SPEAKER_10]: If you need...

1231
01:35:38,276 --> 01:35:43,038
[SPEAKER_10]: information about what that all entails, look at what Loki just said, because that will probably be reality.

1232
01:35:43,058 --> 01:35:52,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that's, I mean, when it comes down to dictating, I mean, perfect example, there'll be games that come out that are street dated.

1233
01:35:52,824 --> 01:35:59,588
[SPEAKER_02]: Earth Defense Force, for example, you know, and Earth Defense Force was supposed to come out on Tuesday in July.

1234
01:36:00,209 --> 01:36:00,429
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1235
01:36:01,522 --> 01:36:13,332
[SPEAKER_02]: D3, they fucked up, they accidentally printed a date on the box that didn't coincide with that date that was on the actual packaging and what they've been communicated to all the different stores.

1236
01:36:14,113 --> 01:36:24,922
[SPEAKER_02]: So, whereas a regular store would go, hey, wait a second, this date looks wrong, and they would contact D3 and D3 are like, oh yeah, that was a misprint, the street date is still the date we stated.

1237
01:36:26,109 --> 01:36:30,253
[SPEAKER_02]: GameStop said, hey, you printed a different date on here that happens to be earlier.

1238
01:36:30,413 --> 01:36:31,434
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to use that date.

1239
01:36:32,215 --> 01:36:33,236
[SPEAKER_02]: And you don't want us to put it out?

1240
01:36:33,256 --> 01:36:33,817
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, fuck you.

1241
01:36:33,857 --> 01:36:35,098
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just going to put it out anyways.

1242
01:36:36,359 --> 01:36:40,464
[SPEAKER_02]: And even though that information wasn't communicated to all the other retailers out there, ah, fuck them.

1243
01:36:40,584 --> 01:36:41,164
[SPEAKER_02]: We're GameStop.

1244
01:36:41,184 --> 01:36:47,070
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to put it out anyways because you put a date on here and we're adhering to the date that you put on this even though it is a misprint.

1245
01:36:47,951 --> 01:37:00,253
[SPEAKER_02]: that's the type of company GameStop is they will do whatever cutthroat thing they need to do to be on top so if you like all the streaming services like on live and stuff well I hope they survive

1246
01:37:02,889 --> 01:37:29,291
[SPEAKER_10]: Kaijudo in chat says why all the GameStop hate all they do is sell us games and they've been made buying games easier for people like me who don't like to shop online remember the 80s and how much Toys R Us and mom and pop shops would sell games an arm and a leg 90 plus dollars again I have to defer back to my earlier rant that would have been about three or four weeks ago because I really don't want to get into it again but there's plenty of other options plenty of other options so

1247
01:37:30,660 --> 01:37:31,920
[SPEAKER_10]: That's all I'm gonna say about that for now.

1248
01:37:53,487 --> 01:37:56,888
[SPEAKER_10]: GameStop is a company that has done some things to people I know that I don't like and I'm not going to support them.

1249
01:38:22,280 --> 01:38:25,463
[SPEAKER_07]: And you're perfectly justified, I think.

1250
01:38:26,143 --> 01:38:26,483
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree.

1251
01:38:26,884 --> 01:38:27,024
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.

1252
01:38:27,955 --> 01:38:31,016
[SPEAKER_10]: So, let's move on to happier news, shall we?

1253
01:38:32,257 --> 01:38:33,577
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's talk about VidRhythm.

1254
01:38:33,857 --> 01:38:38,779
[SPEAKER_10]: VidRhythm is Harmonix's new video game franchise, music franchise.

1255
01:38:39,900 --> 01:38:43,061
[SPEAKER_10]: And a lot of people were saying, ooh, maybe this will be like when they heard the title.

1256
01:38:43,081 --> 01:38:46,303
[SPEAKER_10]: Because we heard the title because of a trademark or application or one of those things before.

1257
01:38:46,963 --> 01:38:51,725
[SPEAKER_10]: And a lot of people were hoping, ooh, maybe it's like a new frequency or amplitude or something like that.

1258
01:38:51,785 --> 01:38:53,826
[SPEAKER_10]: Like VidRhythm, like videos and stuff.

1259
01:38:54,246 --> 01:38:56,927
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it turns out that the game has been announced for...

1260
01:38:58,092 --> 01:38:58,512
[SPEAKER_10]: IOS.

1261
01:38:59,833 --> 01:39:10,478
[SPEAKER_10]: In a Gamasutra interview with Alex Rogopoulos, who's the Harmonix head honcho, he says that it's for the IOS and it's more of an app than a game.

1262
01:39:11,199 --> 01:39:19,323
[SPEAKER_10]: Quote, we think there are a lot of creative opportunities with smartphones that we haven't really been able to focus on yet.

1263
01:39:19,723 --> 01:39:22,345
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're looking forward to doing more in that space.

1264
01:39:23,405 --> 01:39:23,725
[SPEAKER_10]: Hmm.

1265
01:39:24,346 --> 01:39:29,429
[SPEAKER_10]: So it sounds like this may have something to do more so than just a game.

1266
01:39:30,130 --> 01:39:32,011
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe it has something to do with location.

1267
01:39:32,531 --> 01:39:36,214
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe it has something to do with pictures or videos that the phones can do now.

1268
01:39:36,794 --> 01:39:37,254
[SPEAKER_10]: Who knows?

1269
01:39:37,635 --> 01:39:38,395
[SPEAKER_10]: It could be interesting.

1270
01:39:39,416 --> 01:39:40,136
[SPEAKER_10]: I have no idea.

1271
01:39:40,156 --> 01:39:41,997
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, a statement like that could really go anywhere.

1272
01:39:42,058 --> 01:39:48,582
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, I don't know if it's just CEO speak blowing smoke up my ass that they're doing something new when they're really not.

1273
01:39:48,682 --> 01:39:50,083
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just their take on something.

1274
01:39:50,403 --> 01:39:52,765
[SPEAKER_10]: But then I go, but it's harmonics and harmonics.

1275
01:39:53,725 --> 01:39:59,468
[SPEAKER_10]: and they kind of, I mean, Rock Band and keep in mind, they made the original Guitar Hero with Red Octane.

1276
01:39:59,508 --> 01:40:02,169
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, that really was kind of something new.

1277
01:40:02,850 --> 01:40:05,971
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know there's going to be the people that are like, but Guitar Freaks, Guitar Freaks.

1278
01:40:06,411 --> 01:40:07,012
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I'm sorry.

1279
01:40:07,072 --> 01:40:13,555
[SPEAKER_10]: They took the risk of making that more mainstream for America that Konami refused to do time and time again.

1280
01:40:13,595 --> 01:40:17,417
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why Harmonix succeeded here because they did what Konami refused to do.

1281
01:40:20,218 --> 01:40:22,279
[SPEAKER_08]: Harmonix does what Konami don't do.

1282
01:40:22,759 --> 01:40:23,339
[SPEAKER_10]: Something like that.

1283
01:40:23,380 --> 01:40:25,001
[SPEAKER_10]: But let's face it, we're long past that.

1284
01:40:25,281 --> 01:40:27,042
[SPEAKER_10]: That whole stuff is years old.

1285
01:40:27,442 --> 01:40:29,664
[SPEAKER_10]: So now it's about, what is vidrhythm?

1286
01:40:31,545 --> 01:40:31,985
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1287
01:40:32,365 --> 01:40:32,766
[SPEAKER_10]: Vidrhythm...

1288
01:40:34,164 --> 01:40:34,484
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1289
01:40:34,504 --> 01:40:42,093
[SPEAKER_10]: I see in my mind that when he talks about we're trying to do things with smartphones that haven't been done, maybe it has something to do with location or picture.

1290
01:40:42,113 --> 01:40:44,055
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know why pictures keep coming to my mind.

1291
01:40:44,456 --> 01:40:49,561
[SPEAKER_10]: But maybe somehow it has to do with pictures on your phone getting incorporated into the game.

1292
01:40:49,802 --> 01:40:50,142
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1293
01:40:50,723 --> 01:40:52,385
[SPEAKER_10]: But that alone sounds really cheesy.

1294
01:40:52,485 --> 01:40:53,105
[SPEAKER_10]: So I don't know.

1295
01:40:53,846 --> 01:40:57,508
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess we'll see more when the demo is out or what happens with it.

1296
01:40:57,769 --> 01:41:04,052
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, if it's iOS, then it'll be one of those things where they'll just be like, oh, it's coming out whenever Apple pushes it to the store, which could be like tomorrow.

1297
01:41:04,873 --> 01:41:05,353
[SPEAKER_10]: So we'll see.

1298
01:41:06,654 --> 01:41:08,875
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, let's move on to the mailbag.

1299
01:41:09,096 --> 01:41:17,641
[SPEAKER_10]: Every week, DarkSakura dives into the mailbag headfirst and pulls out some emails that she thinks, hey, I should read this on the air.

1300
01:41:18,001 --> 01:41:19,102
[SPEAKER_10]: Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

1301
01:41:19,864 --> 01:41:20,824
[SPEAKER_08]: You wanna know what sucks?

1302
01:41:21,004 --> 01:41:21,185
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

1303
01:41:21,625 --> 01:41:41,692
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that the window I had the mailbag open in was closed Sorry, hold on, let me reopen it You better open that shit real fast Alright, I guess I can plug Twitter again real quick at the end of the show, because we'll be doing your Twitter topics Twitter.com slash OLR We will be doing the Skype line later The 800 number is back tonight, thank you very much So, uh, wait for that

1304
01:41:42,028 --> 01:41:42,588
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, here they are.

1305
01:41:43,569 --> 01:41:43,849
[SPEAKER_07]: You ready?

1306
01:41:45,210 --> 01:41:46,271
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I want to talk more.

1307
01:41:46,411 --> 01:41:46,751
[SPEAKER_08]: Meh.

1308
01:41:48,613 --> 01:41:50,954
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, and by the way, I'm not going to call you person.

1309
01:41:51,375 --> 01:41:56,779
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey guys, thanks for the show, particularly to Rob for posting the podcast to the feed as quick as he's doing.

1310
01:41:57,159 --> 01:41:59,601
[SPEAKER_08]: It really makes a difference for those of us who are unable to listen live.

1311
01:42:00,241 --> 01:42:05,045
[SPEAKER_08]: At the top of the show, there was some angst about having mobile games that just aren't optimized for various...

1312
01:42:07,046 --> 01:42:07,186
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

1313
01:42:07,206 --> 01:42:07,346
[SPEAKER_08]: Really.

1314
01:42:33,892 --> 01:42:40,974
[SPEAKER_08]: Finally, with it being an open platform, there's a bunch of great apps for gamers who, like me, prefer a physical gamepad, even going so far as to use a Wiimote for our games.

1315
01:42:41,435 --> 01:42:41,875
[SPEAKER_08]: For free.

1316
01:42:42,275 --> 01:42:47,797
[SPEAKER_08]: A first-person shooter on my Zoom with the moat and nunchuck over Bluetooth is great for traveling.

1317
01:42:49,326 --> 01:42:50,628
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god, I haven't had an horchata in forever.

1318
01:43:04,938 --> 01:43:06,739
[SPEAKER_08]: I know a place that's open late that has them.

1319
01:43:07,059 --> 01:43:07,579
[SPEAKER_10]: So good.

1320
01:43:08,160 --> 01:43:12,062
[SPEAKER_08]: But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive, which is a Shakespeare quote.

1321
01:43:12,122 --> 01:43:12,622
[SPEAKER_08]: He put it on there.

1322
01:43:13,162 --> 01:43:16,844
[SPEAKER_08]: And that is from, I'm going to say Dr. Noir.

1323
01:43:17,564 --> 01:43:19,885
[SPEAKER_10]: Did I miss a question in there?

1324
01:43:19,905 --> 01:43:24,528
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought I heard a question about, we were talking about on the top of last week's show about the mobile games.

1325
01:43:25,448 --> 01:43:26,369
[SPEAKER_08]: Or was it just a statement?

1326
01:43:26,389 --> 01:43:27,129
[SPEAKER_08]: No, just a statement.

1327
01:43:27,269 --> 01:43:27,829
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, my bad.

1328
01:43:28,330 --> 01:43:28,990
[SPEAKER_08]: The Android's better.

1329
01:43:30,589 --> 01:43:31,090
[SPEAKER_10]: Whatever.

1330
01:43:31,730 --> 01:43:32,471
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm glad you think so.

1331
01:43:33,411 --> 01:43:34,492
[SPEAKER_08]: Last one, which is the only one.

1332
01:43:34,713 --> 01:43:38,316
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, OLR, SonicM88 here with another question for you wonderful folks.

1333
01:43:38,936 --> 01:43:40,978
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1334
01:43:40,998 --> 01:43:40,978
42.

1335
01:43:41,338 --> 01:43:41,839
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, fine.

1336
01:43:42,419 --> 01:43:47,503
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm considering buying a few of my favorite games as downloadable games on Xbox via the Games on Demand service.

1337
01:43:47,924 --> 01:43:52,628
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm very lazy and can totally justify the purchase because my biggest problem currently is getting off my ass to change games.

1338
01:43:53,208 --> 01:43:53,889
[SPEAKER_08]: First world problems.

1339
01:43:55,290 --> 01:43:55,630
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?

1340
01:43:56,491 --> 01:43:57,392
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's the problem though.

1341
01:43:57,512 --> 01:44:03,059
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember hearing stories a while back about a Tom Clancy game not being fully compatible with multiplayer.

1342
01:44:03,499 --> 01:44:09,026
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently the physical version was unable to play online multiplayer with the games on demand downloadable version.

1343
01:44:09,106 --> 01:44:15,534
[SPEAKER_08]: In the Xbox marketplace, all I know of the games say is that they don't support online multiplayer whatsoever.

1344
01:44:15,914 --> 01:44:16,275
[SPEAKER_08]: Try Wikipedia

1345
01:44:30,994 --> 01:44:39,319
[SPEAKER_10]: or actually, I'm going to say the official Xbox forums because when shit like that is broken, you will hear the angry gamers and complaints on the official Xbox forum.

1346
01:44:39,739 --> 01:44:41,240
[SPEAKER_10]: So all you have to do is read through one of those.

1347
01:44:41,420 --> 01:44:43,361
[SPEAKER_10]: I vaguely remember what you're talking about.

1348
01:44:43,461 --> 01:44:45,202
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to say that was fixed, though.

1349
01:44:45,262 --> 01:44:47,283
[SPEAKER_10]: I think they did do some type of patch.

1350
01:44:47,663 --> 01:44:51,645
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think Microsoft is intentionally leaving that shit out, but let's face it.

1351
01:44:51,705 --> 01:44:53,726
[SPEAKER_10]: The Games on Demand service is pretty lazy.

1352
01:44:54,107 --> 01:44:59,830
[SPEAKER_10]: All they're doing is they're kind of doing what I talked about at the top of the show with the Wii hack.

1353
01:45:00,591 --> 01:45:06,907
[SPEAKER_10]: you can load the things you load the disk into an image and Microsoft's basically selling you that image

1354
01:45:07,801 --> 01:45:15,945
[SPEAKER_02]: It is literally the, when you take the disc and install it to your hard drive on your 360, it's literally that image that they're selling you.

1355
01:45:16,185 --> 01:45:18,966
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is fine because it's legit.

1356
01:45:19,286 --> 01:45:20,386
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not piracy.

1357
01:45:20,767 --> 01:45:21,667
[SPEAKER_10]: It's through their store.

1358
01:45:21,767 --> 01:45:22,287
[SPEAKER_10]: It's fine.

1359
01:45:23,048 --> 01:45:30,151
[SPEAKER_10]: But that's, you know, essentially they don't do the extensive quality checks that are done when a game is first released.

1360
01:45:30,211 --> 01:45:30,991
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's put it that way.

1361
01:45:31,871 --> 01:45:59,864
[SPEAKER_10]: they might do some minimal quality checks but you know very minimal as you can see by that little story there but those sort of instances should be few and far between to the best of my knowledge those games are supposed to be playable online they're supposed to be just like copies of the regular games it's not supposed to be anything crazy or something Microsoft's locking you out of but I will say this you know if you know it's your money spend it how you want if downloading the game so you don't have to get up and put a disc in is that important to you then fine do it but

1362
01:46:01,164 --> 01:46:18,978
[SPEAKER_10]: just don't be afraid to shop smart too and what I mean by that is don't assume that the price you see on Xbox downloadable is necessarily the cheapest what's more important to you getting up off the couch to change the disc or getting it cheapest you know because you might be able to find a used copy on eBay

1363
01:46:19,538 --> 01:46:20,179
[SPEAKER_10]: Really cheap.

1364
01:46:20,840 --> 01:46:25,227
[SPEAKER_10]: Or possibly you could even find Amazon is having a sale or Best Buy is having a sale.

1365
01:46:25,447 --> 01:46:29,794
[SPEAKER_10]: Best Buy had a great Kinect sale a couple months ago where it was like buy one, get one free.

1366
01:46:30,195 --> 01:46:33,399
[SPEAKER_10]: So always be on the lookout for things like that.

1367
01:46:34,222 --> 01:47:02,687
[SPEAKER_10]: how come nobody told me about that but at the end of the day again it's your money spend it how you want and certainly I've downloaded my share of download games granted that's mostly the arcade stuff but I will say this when I had swine flu back in 09 I had swine flu I was out of work for 9 days I downloaded a game digitally because I was not allowed to leave my house for my doctor so I think in that case I might have a legitimate reason for having done that you know

1368
01:47:04,687 --> 01:47:06,648
[SPEAKER_10]: I would have left my house anyway.

1369
01:47:06,668 --> 01:47:10,589
[SPEAKER_10]: Give it to as many people as possible.

1370
01:47:11,990 --> 01:47:12,890
[SPEAKER_08]: Who cares about co-workers?

1371
01:47:13,470 --> 01:47:16,691
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's actually pretty funny.

1372
01:47:17,391 --> 01:47:18,452
[SPEAKER_08]: Just to make a quick mention.

1373
01:47:19,612 --> 01:47:26,214
[SPEAKER_08]: That's actually where the source of most illness is from the workplace.

1374
01:47:28,533 --> 01:47:34,962
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, since I have not been working, Rob, I've only been sick, like really sick, once.

1375
01:47:36,244 --> 01:47:36,745
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I know.

1376
01:47:38,388 --> 01:47:39,068
[SPEAKER_10]: It's crazy.

1377
01:47:39,469 --> 01:47:41,469
[SPEAKER_08]: Quarantined here in the safety of my home.

1378
01:47:42,790 --> 01:47:43,110
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1379
01:47:44,091 --> 01:47:44,911
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's move on.

1380
01:47:45,091 --> 01:47:46,472
[SPEAKER_10]: Since that was the end of the email bag, right?

1381
01:47:47,032 --> 01:47:47,392
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, it was.

1382
01:47:47,412 --> 01:47:48,452
[SPEAKER_10]: We need more emails.

1383
01:47:48,913 --> 01:47:49,813
[SPEAKER_10]: Two emails.

1384
01:47:49,933 --> 01:47:51,014
[SPEAKER_10]: That was a sad showing.

1385
01:47:51,074 --> 01:47:53,475
[SPEAKER_08]: If I get 10 emails next week, Rob has to get me an Orchata.

1386
01:47:53,495 --> 01:47:54,915
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not going to do shit.

1387
01:47:55,155 --> 01:47:55,416
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1388
01:47:55,556 --> 01:47:56,296
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that's because you're not here.

1389
01:47:56,436 --> 01:48:01,798
[SPEAKER_08]: And the week after, if we have 10 emails the week after, then I will get Rob an Orchata.

1390
01:48:01,838 --> 01:48:02,599
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1391
01:48:02,859 --> 01:48:03,479
[SPEAKER_10]: Now we're talking.

1392
01:48:03,499 --> 01:48:04,800
[SPEAKER_08]: And then Rob will get me an Orchata.

1393
01:48:04,820 --> 01:48:05,560
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1394
01:48:06,981 --> 01:48:10,624
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, 10 emails means horchata trading happens.

1395
01:48:10,744 --> 01:48:12,746
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1396
01:48:12,826 --> 01:48:16,749
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, it'll just be Mexican drink night here at Orange Lounge Radio.

1397
01:48:16,950 --> 01:48:18,251
[SPEAKER_08]: You can get a tamarindo.

1398
01:48:18,351 --> 01:48:19,512
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll go get some charritos.

1399
01:48:21,353 --> 01:48:26,097
[SPEAKER_08]: I will get horchata, and then we can have some, what's that, apple soda?

1400
01:48:26,977 --> 01:48:28,218
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I'm thinking of, I think.

1401
01:48:30,039 --> 01:48:38,846
[SPEAKER_08]: Yarritos makes the tamarind soda, and they have, I think the same company makes an apple soda, and they have like a lime soda.

1402
01:48:40,027 --> 01:48:46,191
[SPEAKER_10]: And we'll go to Target and get the Coke that's actually from Mexico, that has like the real sugar in it.

1403
01:48:46,704 --> 01:48:47,184
[SPEAKER_10]: and it's kosher.

1404
01:48:48,625 --> 01:48:49,405
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go.

1405
01:48:51,526 --> 01:48:53,147
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we'll drink lots of tequila.

1406
01:48:53,187 --> 01:49:01,071
[SPEAKER_10]: So 10 emails for Mexican drink night for a fiesta in studio here at Orange Lounge Radio.

1407
01:49:01,992 --> 01:49:02,272
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

1408
01:49:04,893 --> 01:49:06,354
[SPEAKER_10]: We gotta get to the FUs of the week.

1409
01:49:06,434 --> 01:49:10,956
[SPEAKER_10]: Every week on the show we get a little bit angsty and we have to share our angst with you all.

1410
01:49:11,056 --> 01:49:11,396
[SPEAKER_10]: Why?

1411
01:49:11,897 --> 01:49:12,357
[SPEAKER_10]: Because we can.

1412
01:49:28,127 --> 01:49:44,002
[SPEAKER_02]: FU to Northrend First world problems Loki FU to Activision for putting out a game called Skylanders Spyro's Adventure Skylanders is first off a really good game

1413
01:49:45,555 --> 01:49:46,315
[SPEAKER_02]: and DarkSakura.com

1414
01:50:16,032 --> 01:50:18,054
[SPEAKER_02]: $8!

1415
01:50:16,793 --> 01:50:18,054
[SPEAKER_02]: $8 for a toy that does nothing.

1416
01:50:18,315 --> 01:50:19,696
[SPEAKER_02]: It is literally a figurine.

1417
01:50:19,716 --> 01:50:21,278
[SPEAKER_02]: It is about 2 inches tall.

1418
01:50:21,678 --> 01:50:22,439
[SPEAKER_02]: It does nothing.

1419
01:50:22,619 --> 01:50:23,360
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't move.

1420
01:50:23,700 --> 01:50:27,224
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't do anything other than activate a character in a game.

1421
01:50:28,005 --> 01:50:28,285
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

1422
01:50:29,944 --> 01:50:39,771
[SPEAKER_02]: Why kids would buy that or parents would buy that instead of, I don't know, a Mario game or, I don't know, any other toy out there on the market is beyond me.

1423
01:50:40,131 --> 01:50:43,394
[SPEAKER_02]: And on top of all that, they want to sell this thing starting off at $70.

1424
01:50:45,695 --> 01:50:52,740
[SPEAKER_02]: $70 for a Wii game, PS3 game, 360 game because it comes with some bullshit toys that aren't really toys.

1425
01:50:52,780 --> 01:50:54,261
[SPEAKER_10]: What would you like to see sell more?

1426
01:50:54,542 --> 01:50:56,143
[SPEAKER_10]: Tickle Me Elmo or this thing?

1427
01:50:56,283 --> 01:50:56,763
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything.

1428
01:50:57,003 --> 01:50:57,804
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything other than this.

1429
01:50:57,984 --> 01:50:58,545
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what?

1430
01:50:58,865 --> 01:51:06,732
[SPEAKER_02]: I predict right now that this is going to be as big of a failure as Tony Hawk Shred, Tony Hawk Ride, and sadly enough, DJ Hero 2.

1431
01:51:06,792 --> 01:51:09,774
[SPEAKER_10]: So meaning like a year and a half later, I'll be able to get them for $10?

1432
01:51:09,914 --> 01:51:10,295
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yes.

1433
01:51:11,055 --> 01:51:11,275
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1434
01:51:11,896 --> 01:51:17,180
[SPEAKER_02]: I really wish I could have gotten some of those Renegade or the bundles of all the stuff.

1435
01:51:17,501 --> 01:51:18,862
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what's even better with that stuff?

1436
01:51:19,222 --> 01:51:20,423
[SPEAKER_02]: Flip it on fucking eBay.

1437
01:51:21,164 --> 01:51:22,805
[SPEAKER_02]: You can make more than $10 off that.

1438
01:51:22,965 --> 01:51:23,145
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell...

1439
01:51:23,886 --> 01:51:25,529
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what you could do with that kind of stuff?

1440
01:51:25,890 --> 01:51:27,773
[SPEAKER_02]: If you got the extra turntables and stuff?

1441
01:51:27,953 --> 01:51:31,459
[SPEAKER_02]: You could flip it to GameStop and make more than $10 off of that.

1442
01:51:31,639 --> 01:51:33,782
[SPEAKER_02]: If you really wanted to go that route.

1443
01:51:34,223 --> 01:51:36,307
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, that's just money in the bag right there.

1444
01:51:37,605 --> 01:51:39,207
[SPEAKER_02]: But yes, it will not sell very well.

1445
01:51:39,387 --> 01:51:40,028
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you know why?

1446
01:51:40,048 --> 01:51:52,823
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there's a lot of kids games coming out this holiday and with Mario and stuff on the 3DS and on the console systems and everything else and Call of Duty no one's going to give a shit about Spyro.

1447
01:51:53,204 --> 01:51:55,587
[SPEAKER_02]: A character that was popular 10 years ago.

1448
01:51:57,134 --> 01:51:58,555
[SPEAKER_10]: Skylanders with Spyro, basically.

1449
01:52:27,389 --> 01:52:27,809
[SPEAKER_10]: You done?

1450
01:52:28,130 --> 01:52:28,430
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm done.

1451
01:52:28,450 --> 01:52:29,250
[SPEAKER_10]: Ah, finally.

1452
01:52:29,651 --> 01:52:36,956
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, uh, my FU of the week goes to Peanut Butter Pinkberry, because, you guys, it's so good.

1453
01:52:37,036 --> 01:52:41,799
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, they do one where they put strawberry jam on it and toasted breadcrumbs, and oh my god.

1454
01:52:42,439 --> 01:52:43,460
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my god, it's so good.

1455
01:52:43,740 --> 01:52:49,364
[SPEAKER_10]: But here's why I give it an FU, because, well, A, it's good, and B, it's not non-fat or low-fat.

1456
01:52:49,524 --> 01:52:53,187
[SPEAKER_10]: Every other flavor in Pinkberry's history has been, like, non-fat or low-fat, but this one...

1457
01:52:54,508 --> 01:52:55,048
[SPEAKER_07]: Extra fat.

1458
01:52:55,248 --> 01:52:55,828
[SPEAKER_10]: Extra fat.

1459
01:52:56,209 --> 01:53:00,171
[SPEAKER_10]: Seven grams of fat a serving, which, you know, ice cream's worse, but still.

1460
01:53:00,691 --> 01:53:01,752
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a little disappointing.

1461
01:53:02,312 --> 01:53:03,553
[SPEAKER_10]: Special occasions only.

1462
01:53:04,854 --> 01:53:06,235
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, this is a real problem, right?

1463
01:53:06,715 --> 01:53:08,096
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, there it is, FUs of the Week.

1464
01:53:08,396 --> 01:53:12,378
[SPEAKER_10]: More news stories for you guys, and then the Skype line is about five stories away.

1465
01:53:13,939 --> 01:53:22,841
[SPEAKER_02]: So Ubisoft is apparently trying to pull a THQ and put out a tablet peripheral for, I guess, the Wii.

1466
01:53:23,082 --> 01:53:25,522
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like it's supposed to be for the Wii.

1467
01:53:26,883 --> 01:53:30,844
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now they're kind of, it's a work in progress thing, Project InTouch.

1468
01:53:31,704 --> 01:53:36,085
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have an internal marketing video that's been found leaked out there.

1469
01:53:36,885 --> 01:53:43,832
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, they have some sort of tablet that's going to be used to play games.

1470
01:53:44,113 --> 01:53:46,455
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically all the same stuff that you see right now with the U-Draw.

1471
01:53:49,238 --> 01:53:49,618
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1472
01:53:50,079 --> 01:53:51,820
[SPEAKER_02]: It's interesting, I guess.

1473
01:53:53,722 --> 01:53:59,388
[SPEAKER_02]: I know the U-Draw is doing alright, but I don't know if there's really room on the market for multiple tablet peripherals.

1474
01:54:00,455 --> 01:54:01,155
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

1475
01:54:21,423 --> 01:54:26,848
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's hard to convince people to buy... More plastic shit.

1476
01:54:27,549 --> 01:54:34,475
[SPEAKER_02]: ...a $100 skateboard for a game that, you know, it's really going to be the only game that's going to support it, or two games.

1477
01:54:34,495 --> 01:54:38,959
[SPEAKER_10]: So why is UDraw succeeded in where this one is trying to get some of that success?

1478
01:54:38,979 --> 01:54:43,824
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, UDraw succeeded because they've got a lot of different games that have come out for it.

1479
01:54:44,204 --> 01:54:45,325
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, they have...

1480
01:54:47,067 --> 01:54:50,008
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's about five games right now that support it.

1481
01:54:50,629 --> 01:54:52,230
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a lot more coming out this fall.

1482
01:54:52,330 --> 01:54:55,612
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus, there's going to be more UDraw stuff on other systems.

1483
01:54:56,132 --> 01:54:58,794
[SPEAKER_02]: You get it on the PlayStation 3 and 360 as well this year.

1484
01:54:59,734 --> 01:55:05,218
[SPEAKER_02]: And on top of that, besides the licensed stuff that THQ's done, like with SpongeBob and...

1485
01:55:05,558 --> 01:55:06,979
[SPEAKER_02]: They're Marvel stuff.

1486
01:55:07,340 --> 01:55:17,889
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got now licenses from other companies like Disney Princess stuff, and actually there's going to be a Mickey drawing program or something like that, a Disney animation program.

1487
01:55:18,309 --> 01:55:19,490
[SPEAKER_02]: Gosh, that sounds like fun.

1488
01:55:19,510 --> 01:55:20,591
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be kind of cool.

1489
01:55:20,711 --> 01:55:24,435
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're getting other companies to support this kind of thing.

1490
01:55:24,455 --> 01:55:29,839
[SPEAKER_02]: So Ubisoft, I'm sure if you played your cards right and talked to THQ, they would probably let you make a game for...

1491
01:55:30,880 --> 01:55:32,120
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the UDraw tablet.

1492
01:55:32,500 --> 01:55:33,821
[SPEAKER_02]: Save yourself a whole bunch of time.

1493
01:55:33,901 --> 01:55:35,861
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead, you're going to put out this other peripheral.

1494
01:55:35,901 --> 01:55:37,142
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, why would they do that?

1495
01:55:37,602 --> 01:55:38,822
[SPEAKER_10]: Why would they do that?

1496
01:55:39,082 --> 01:55:44,643
[SPEAKER_02]: Why would you concede to another company to make it a lot easier for yourself when you can just make something that will fail on your own?

1497
01:55:44,663 --> 01:55:46,924
[SPEAKER_10]: And you can just fucking steamroll with all your franchises.

1498
01:55:47,504 --> 01:55:52,665
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, why would we bother publishing with the UDraw when we can make our own and take the market from UDraw?

1499
01:55:52,945 --> 01:55:56,806
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just... I don't think there's really going to be a market for it.

1500
01:55:57,407 --> 01:55:58,247
[SPEAKER_02]: But we'll see.

1501
01:55:58,647 --> 01:55:58,947
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

1502
01:56:00,496 --> 01:56:03,057
[SPEAKER_02]: They've tried to think outside the box with different stuff.

1503
01:56:03,317 --> 01:56:08,399
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember, it was last E3, they had a bunch of games that weren't really games.

1504
01:56:08,679 --> 01:56:22,004
[SPEAKER_02]: They had some sort of relaxation program or something like that, where you basically... It was basically the... What was it?

1505
01:56:22,044 --> 01:56:22,184
[SPEAKER_02]: The...

1506
01:56:25,080 --> 01:56:28,002
[SPEAKER_02]: That stupid Wii peripheral that they had that they never put out.

1507
01:56:28,022 --> 01:56:28,943
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember the hell it was.

1508
01:56:28,983 --> 01:56:30,223
[SPEAKER_02]: The Vitality Sensor.

1509
01:56:30,464 --> 01:56:32,845
[SPEAKER_02]: It was basically the Vitality Sensor, but on the PC.

1510
01:56:33,586 --> 01:56:37,828
[SPEAKER_02]: And they had that come out, and they had some laser tag game come out that wasn't really a game.

1511
01:56:37,888 --> 01:56:39,369
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just something that ran on the PC.

1512
01:56:40,490 --> 01:56:41,911
[SPEAKER_02]: It was basically a laser tag toy.

1513
01:56:42,652 --> 01:56:48,535
[SPEAKER_02]: And they had one other thing that was kind of along the lines of that.

1514
01:56:50,357 --> 01:56:53,679
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they're definitely trying some unique stuff over there at Ubisoft.

1515
01:56:57,367 --> 01:57:00,217
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, well, we'll see if it works for him.

1516
01:57:00,277 --> 01:57:00,658
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1517
01:57:00,698 --> 01:57:04,411
[SPEAKER_10]: I think flooding the market with too much of the similar shit is going to end up being a bad thing, but we'll see.

1518
01:57:05,330 --> 01:57:14,996
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow, there's been rumors going around forever that Diablo 3, you know, big PC release coming out later this year, big rumor for the longest time that it'll probably end up on consoles as well.

1519
01:57:15,356 --> 01:57:29,726
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, let's just fan the flames of that fire because during a Gamescom press conference this week, Josh Moschera, who's the lead designer behind Diablo 3, said that Blizzard is, quote, very, very serious about bringing the Diablo 3 experience to the console.

1520
01:57:30,686 --> 01:57:34,269
[SPEAKER_10]: The company is, quote, trying to build the best console team at Blizzard.

1521
01:57:34,989 --> 01:57:49,786
[SPEAKER_02]: now they're not saying what game they're working on but you can expect it's probably Diablo or it's the new MMO that would be ironic if that was the case because Diablo 3 doesn't have to be connected to the internet the whole time to play the game but the console version you probably wouldn't have to be

1522
01:57:51,674 --> 01:58:20,607
[SPEAKER_10]: um that's maybe or maybe not true uh we could that could be a sticking point for why it's not on the consoles right now I would think that whole real money trade auction house is what's holding things up especially when it comes to Xbox 360 I could not see that shit flying on the 360 without Microsoft getting a cut of that somehow although then again to have Diablo 3 on their console would be a pretty big score for them so it would have to be online only and if not um that thing would get hacked apart

1523
01:58:21,443 --> 01:58:23,804
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe they're going to keep it separate from the PC one somehow.

1524
01:58:24,024 --> 01:58:24,404
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.

1525
01:58:24,424 --> 01:58:27,005
[SPEAKER_02]: They could do that without the real money auction house.

1526
01:58:27,225 --> 01:58:27,365
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.

1527
01:58:28,045 --> 01:58:29,245
[SPEAKER_10]: So we will see.

1528
01:58:29,945 --> 01:58:32,026
[SPEAKER_10]: But for now, that's all we know.

1529
01:58:32,166 --> 01:58:34,847
[SPEAKER_10]: More rumors to fuel those fires.

1530
01:58:35,627 --> 01:58:36,987
[SPEAKER_10]: So I don't care.

1531
01:58:37,027 --> 01:58:39,868
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm still getting Diablo 3 just because I was such a sucker for the first one.

1532
01:58:39,928 --> 01:58:40,708
[SPEAKER_10]: So whatever.

1533
01:58:41,388 --> 01:58:42,109
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think I am.

1534
01:58:43,009 --> 01:58:43,809
[SPEAKER_10]: Aw, sad face.

1535
01:58:43,849 --> 01:58:45,149
[SPEAKER_07]: I never got into the other Diablo games.

1536
01:58:46,790 --> 01:58:46,890
[SPEAKER_07]: So.

1537
01:58:47,987 --> 01:58:48,308
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura.com

1538
01:59:05,049 --> 01:59:05,810
[SPEAKER_08]: So who knows?

1539
01:59:05,890 --> 01:59:12,495
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe they'll be going back to Squirt, which actually makes sense because I'm going to use this as an example.

1540
01:59:12,535 --> 01:59:17,199
[SPEAKER_08]: The company that I used to work for when I was doing student loans, we were Educade.

1541
01:59:18,280 --> 01:59:26,987
[SPEAKER_08]: When Wachovia purchased the company, they've actually purchased First Union, which owned Educade and the money store and all that.

1542
01:59:27,908 --> 01:59:35,872
[SPEAKER_08]: But we had to brand ourselves as Educate Wachovia, and then after a while we became Wachovia Student Services or whatever.

1543
01:59:36,873 --> 01:59:40,194
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's the same thing, I think.

1544
01:59:40,454 --> 01:59:47,738
[SPEAKER_08]: Now that they've got Square and Enix in everybody's head, they're going to rebrand back to Square.

1545
01:59:50,049 --> 01:59:51,090
[SPEAKER_08]: It makes perfect sense.

1546
01:59:51,310 --> 02:00:01,115
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I also think of remember when there was G4 and then there was Tech TV and then there was G4 Tech TV and then it was like chomp and now it's just G4 again.

1547
02:00:01,135 --> 02:00:02,915
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's just part of rebranding.

1548
02:00:03,136 --> 02:00:03,636
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1549
02:00:03,676 --> 02:00:11,760
[SPEAKER_08]: With any acquisition, especially with a big company, something that's well known, you have to merge your branding so that people will start associating one with the other.

1550
02:00:13,141 --> 02:00:17,863
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm still sad to see the name Enix go away because now we'll never get another bus to move.

1551
02:00:19,656 --> 02:00:21,197
[SPEAKER_08]: We might, but it won't say Enix on it.

1552
02:00:21,577 --> 02:00:22,138
[SPEAKER_10]: That's true.

1553
02:00:23,258 --> 02:00:23,738
[SPEAKER_08]: That's okay.

1554
02:00:23,779 --> 02:00:25,860
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll just bust out my other two bust moves.

1555
02:00:27,121 --> 02:00:27,581
[SPEAKER_08]: Play them.

1556
02:00:28,241 --> 02:00:28,541
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

1557
02:00:29,402 --> 02:00:30,483
[SPEAKER_10]: So we'll see what happens with that.

1558
02:00:31,003 --> 02:00:35,686
[SPEAKER_10]: Couple more stories for you guys, then we're gonna get to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1559
02:00:35,726 --> 02:00:36,306
[SPEAKER_10]: But not just yet.

1560
02:00:36,886 --> 02:00:37,787
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki's got a story for us.

1561
02:00:40,787 --> 02:00:43,969
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some interesting stuff on the PlayStation Network front.

1562
02:00:43,989 --> 02:00:50,031
[SPEAKER_02]: They're actually going to start offering some cheaper rentals for different movies and TV shows.

1563
02:00:51,272 --> 02:00:57,534
[SPEAKER_02]: $0.99 movie and TV rentals are coming, and right now they've got a really small list of what's going to be available.

1564
02:00:58,094 --> 02:01:05,657
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess every Tuesday, a selection of movies and TV rentals will see a discount of $0.99 for the SD versions and $1.99 for HD.

1565
02:01:08,779 --> 02:01:30,755
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe this week was Sicko, The Long Shots, Salvage, Tony, Shank, Bonded by Blood, JFK, Reckless Youth Part 1 and Part 2, Deadly Blessing, Carver, Devil in the Flesh, and Illuminating Angels and Demons.

1566
02:01:31,775 --> 02:01:35,358
[SPEAKER_02]: That was what was on there.

1567
02:01:35,686 --> 02:01:37,269
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're going to be discounting stuff each week.

1568
02:01:37,289 --> 02:01:42,899
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of neat, I guess, to drive a little bit more sales in that category.

1569
02:01:43,420 --> 02:01:44,883
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially maybe to compete a little bit with

1570
02:01:46,255 --> 02:02:08,457
[SPEAKER_10]: Redbox and yeah but the stuff they're offering is crap have you looked at what's on the list it's all a bunch of crap but hey you know what something's something cheaper is still better than nothing I still don't see how any of that stuff's really a better value than Netflix although I guess you know Netflix is kind of challenged for a lot of content and may continue to be challenged over the next year or what have you but I don't know

1571
02:02:08,837 --> 02:02:17,347
[SPEAKER_10]: Like I was looking, one of my friends uses that Vudu site and I kind of saw that for the first time over the weekend and I don't know, it seemed too expensive for me.

1572
02:02:18,528 --> 02:02:21,752
[SPEAKER_10]: I was like, dang, they want too much money for all these rentals of old stuff.

1573
02:02:21,792 --> 02:02:26,558
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, I guess everything seems expensive next to Netflix where you're paying the one fee for the whole month, you know?

1574
02:02:28,444 --> 02:02:28,824
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I don't know.

1575
02:02:28,924 --> 02:02:29,364
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just me.

1576
02:02:30,705 --> 02:02:33,947
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, one other story for you guys, and this has to do with Portal 2.

1577
02:02:35,327 --> 02:02:37,448
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course you love Portal 2, right, DarkSakura?

1578
02:02:37,889 --> 02:02:38,289
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1579
02:02:38,369 --> 02:02:40,010
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura speaks for all the listeners.

1580
02:02:41,410 --> 02:02:45,052
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, Portal 2, you know, we were supposed to be getting download content.

1581
02:02:45,192 --> 02:02:46,153
[SPEAKER_10]: Where the hell is it?

1582
02:02:46,473 --> 02:02:49,134
[SPEAKER_10]: It was supposed to be here in the summer, and it's still not here.

1583
02:02:49,954 --> 02:02:50,835
[SPEAKER_08]: Burn his house down.

1584
02:02:52,156 --> 02:02:56,058
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently, it's going to be happening in September.

1585
02:02:56,538 --> 02:02:59,560
[SPEAKER_10]: September is when the download content will be coming out.

1586
02:02:59,860 --> 02:03:00,741
[SPEAKER_10]: And they are saying it's free.

1587
02:03:01,201 --> 02:03:05,783
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you're like all huffy and puffy about the fact that the download content still is now, you know what?

1588
02:03:05,803 --> 02:03:06,844
[SPEAKER_10]: Good things come to those who wait.

1589
02:03:08,005 --> 02:03:10,366
[SPEAKER_10]: They have not said what the download content might include.

1590
02:03:11,006 --> 02:03:18,651
[SPEAKER_10]: And all that's being said about it is that Valve's Doug Lombardi apparently said, quote, it's still technically summer.

1591
02:03:21,109 --> 02:03:22,530
[SPEAKER_10]: which he does have a point, right?

1592
02:03:22,690 --> 02:03:24,912
[SPEAKER_10]: Fall doesn't really start until what?

1593
02:03:24,972 --> 02:03:25,953
[SPEAKER_10]: September 21st?

1594
02:03:26,533 --> 02:03:30,116
[SPEAKER_10]: So technically it is still summer in early September.

1595
02:03:30,216 --> 02:03:31,257
[SPEAKER_10]: So fine.

1596
02:03:31,277 --> 02:03:32,958
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the dorkiest thing I've ever heard.

1597
02:03:32,978 --> 02:03:34,659
[SPEAKER_10]: You win on this technicality.

1598
02:03:34,760 --> 02:03:42,986
[SPEAKER_10]: You better have it out or we're sending more protesters out to protest in front of Valve because that's the thing people do these days.

1599
02:03:44,867 --> 02:03:45,228
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1600
02:03:47,062 --> 02:03:47,602
[SPEAKER_10]: Twitter.com slash OLR

1601
02:04:16,860 --> 02:04:23,046
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the show where every gamer has a voice and we welcome that through the phones or through our Twitter.

1602
02:04:23,907 --> 02:04:29,813
[SPEAKER_10]: Or, of course, there's always the chat room if you're like, you know, I don't have a Twitter or I'm too lazy to call or what have you.

1603
02:04:30,213 --> 02:04:32,415
[SPEAKER_08]: Our Twitter brings all the calls to the yard.

1604
02:04:32,435 --> 02:04:33,096
[SPEAKER_08]: You can always do it that way.

1605
02:04:34,778 --> 02:04:38,041
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's like, damn right, my call quality is better than yours.

1606
02:04:38,602 --> 02:04:38,862
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

1607
02:04:39,663 --> 02:04:40,023
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1608
02:04:42,196 --> 02:04:55,446
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, let's see, trying to go to some of the tweets here from earlier in the week We got wished a happy third to a birthday Nice, by who?

1609
02:04:58,871 --> 02:05:00,353
[SPEAKER_10]: Twee Birthday or some account.

1610
02:05:00,393 --> 02:05:00,673
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1611
02:05:00,693 --> 02:05:01,894
[SPEAKER_10]: It's probably a spam account.

1612
02:05:01,914 --> 02:05:02,254
[SPEAKER_10]: Who knows?

1613
02:05:02,875 --> 02:05:03,195
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1614
02:05:03,255 --> 02:05:03,875
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's go to the phone.

1615
02:05:03,895 --> 02:05:04,976
[SPEAKER_07]: You've been on Twitter a while.

1616
02:05:05,797 --> 02:05:06,357
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a dollar.

1617
02:05:06,477 --> 02:05:07,498
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, you're on Orange House Radio.

1618
02:05:07,518 --> 02:05:07,859
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

1619
02:05:08,359 --> 02:05:09,160
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Death Wishing.

1620
02:05:09,180 --> 02:05:09,540
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, my God.

1621
02:05:09,580 --> 02:05:10,341
[SPEAKER_10]: I can see you.

1622
02:05:11,562 --> 02:05:12,182
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, you can.

1623
02:05:13,203 --> 02:05:14,464
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank God you have a shirt on.

1624
02:05:14,504 --> 02:05:14,864
[SPEAKER_10]: What's up?

1625
02:05:15,725 --> 02:05:16,966
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm playing EVE Online.

1626
02:05:17,907 --> 02:05:18,327
[SPEAKER_10]: What's EVE?

1627
02:05:18,447 --> 02:05:18,707
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1628
02:05:19,148 --> 02:05:20,609
[SPEAKER_10]: I've never played EVE Online before.

1629
02:05:21,049 --> 02:05:21,970
[SPEAKER_10]: What's EVE Online like?

1630
02:05:22,694 --> 02:05:28,476
[SPEAKER_01]: Space Cowboy with tons of space rocks and mining and just people being assholes.

1631
02:05:31,436 --> 02:05:33,137
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I can give you an example.

1632
02:05:33,417 --> 02:05:39,119
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot harder than World of Warcraft and it's a lot better in my opinion because you can pretty much do whatever you want.

1633
02:05:39,139 --> 02:05:40,599
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to follow your class guideline.

1634
02:05:42,575 --> 02:05:43,355
[SPEAKER_01]: The customization.

1635
02:05:43,395 --> 02:05:52,920
[SPEAKER_01]: They recently also just released an expansion where you can walk around in stations, which is also going to build into the game Dust 5.14, if you also heard of that, which I kind of want to talk about.

1636
02:05:52,940 --> 02:05:53,940
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1637
02:05:53,980 --> 02:05:54,380
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, yeah.

1638
02:05:54,780 --> 02:05:58,482
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's talk about that a little bit, because I did hear about that at E3, and it sounded really exciting.

1639
02:05:58,762 --> 02:05:59,782
[SPEAKER_10]: What's this all about?

1640
02:06:00,283 --> 02:06:04,524
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, think of, you know, the game Planetside, and did you ever play it?

1641
02:06:05,845 --> 02:06:05,945
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

1642
02:06:06,886 --> 02:06:07,006
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

1643
02:06:08,857 --> 02:06:18,782
[SPEAKER_01]: Dust is a first-person shooter that is going to be pretty much just like Planetside, but for the PS3.

1644
02:06:19,003 --> 02:06:33,150
[SPEAKER_01]: Only the PS3, which is weird, but it's going to tie in to EVE Online, where basically it will work as in the player-run corporations that are on EVE Online will be able to hire mercenaries from the PlayStation 3 to fight over planets in the EVE universe.

1645
02:06:33,810 --> 02:06:37,632
[SPEAKER_01]: Which, basically, they will fight over minerals, blah blah blah, whatever the hell is on the planet.

1646
02:06:37,652 --> 02:06:39,373
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be a pile of shit, I don't know.

1647
02:06:40,514 --> 02:06:45,156
[SPEAKER_01]: And, basically, corporations will buy us, the PlayStation 3 users...

1648
02:06:46,744 --> 02:06:48,565
[SPEAKER_01]: All their weaponry, all their tanks and stuff.

1649
02:06:48,585 --> 02:06:57,008
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, if the PC users supply their mercenary corporation, they earn pretty much unlimited wealth.

1650
02:06:57,408 --> 02:06:58,588
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what Dust is.

1651
02:06:59,528 --> 02:07:01,409
[SPEAKER_01]: And EVE Online is really hard to explain.

1652
02:07:01,449 --> 02:07:03,670
[SPEAKER_01]: All I can say is it's hard.

1653
02:07:05,037 --> 02:07:09,459
[SPEAKER_10]: What makes it so rewarding to be playing the game?

1654
02:07:11,781 --> 02:07:13,622
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything in this game is basically player-run.

1655
02:07:13,682 --> 02:07:22,886
[SPEAKER_01]: They have player-run banks that people make real spreadsheets and stuff where you put your in-game money, and it works exactly like a real bank, building interest, taking out loans and stuff like that.

1656
02:07:23,567 --> 02:07:26,608
[SPEAKER_01]: But then, as you would think, there's also people that scam that system.

1657
02:07:26,708 --> 02:07:29,430
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a couple months ago, there was a guy who made a bank

1658
02:07:30,509 --> 02:07:38,953
[SPEAKER_01]: made it for two years, got about $870 billion ISK, transferred all that money to another account, closed his account down, and all of the users were complaining that they lost money, right?

1659
02:07:39,494 --> 02:07:39,654
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

1660
02:07:39,694 --> 02:07:45,177
[SPEAKER_01]: The freaking corporation just told them, or the CCP, who runs the game, said, welcome to the game.

1661
02:07:45,357 --> 02:07:46,097
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't trust people.

1662
02:07:50,259 --> 02:07:51,780
[SPEAKER_01]: And it doesn't hold your hand like World of Warcraft.

1663
02:07:51,800 --> 02:07:52,340
[SPEAKER_01]: Did I say that?

1664
02:07:52,741 --> 02:07:54,502
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, you did mention that a little bit, I think.

1665
02:07:55,342 --> 02:07:56,803
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's hard to explain, but...

1666
02:07:59,062 --> 02:07:59,382
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

1667
02:07:59,442 --> 02:08:01,464
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I want to say that I hate Activision.

1668
02:08:02,364 --> 02:08:03,385
[SPEAKER_10]: Why do you hate Activision?

1669
02:08:03,405 --> 02:08:06,147
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the guy who runs the company is such an asshole.

1670
02:08:06,287 --> 02:08:06,947
[SPEAKER_10]: Bobby Kotick?

1671
02:08:07,388 --> 02:08:09,369
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he ruins game series.

1672
02:08:09,409 --> 02:08:10,550
[SPEAKER_01]: He's ruined Tony Hawk.

1673
02:08:10,570 --> 02:08:11,611
[SPEAKER_01]: He ruined Call of Duty.

1674
02:08:11,871 --> 02:08:13,632
[SPEAKER_10]: What fuckery is he responsible for this week?

1675
02:08:13,652 --> 02:08:15,173
[SPEAKER_10]: What fuckery set you off this week?

1676
02:08:16,194 --> 02:08:17,214
[SPEAKER_01]: Besides jobs.

1677
02:08:19,656 --> 02:08:20,136
[SPEAKER_01]: Activision.

1678
02:08:21,687 --> 02:08:23,647
[SPEAKER_10]: I think there's a bit of personal bitterness here to this.

1679
02:08:23,727 --> 02:08:25,368
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just an angry person.

1680
02:08:25,788 --> 02:08:26,828
[SPEAKER_01]: An angry college kid.

1681
02:08:26,888 --> 02:08:29,588
[SPEAKER_10]: You're just an angry listener.

1682
02:08:29,628 --> 02:08:30,389
[SPEAKER_10]: An angry gamer.

1683
02:08:31,609 --> 02:08:31,849
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

1684
02:08:33,469 --> 02:08:36,050
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually have more to talk about, but I'm actually a boring person this week.

1685
02:08:36,090 --> 02:08:38,330
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kind of on a recovery day.

1686
02:08:38,470 --> 02:08:41,231
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, let me read this tweet for a recovery day.

1687
02:08:41,791 --> 02:08:44,131
[SPEAKER_10]: Was Burning Man this week or something?

1688
02:08:45,992 --> 02:08:46,672
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't worry about it.

1689
02:08:46,732 --> 02:08:47,852
[SPEAKER_01]: What were you going to say?

1690
02:08:48,012 --> 02:08:48,472
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, fine.

1691
02:08:49,063 --> 02:08:56,147
[SPEAKER_10]: Tiger Claw says EVE Online is by far the most hardcore hardest core game in its existence agree?

1692
02:08:56,688 --> 02:09:17,480
[SPEAKER_01]: I totally agree especially since my corporation got attacked like last week and we lost like 500 million so yikes which um yeah I can also say one thing a lot of the money in the game amounts to real money so like there's ships that cost they're called Titan Claw ships $10,000 real currency they're just throwing that out there $10,000 in real currency yeah

1693
02:09:18,669 --> 02:09:21,650
[SPEAKER_01]: Real currency.

1694
02:09:21,670 --> 02:09:27,991
[SPEAKER_01]: Because $360 million is $15 a currency, which you can use the currency that you make in-game to buy your in-game subscription.

1695
02:09:28,111 --> 02:09:28,731
[SPEAKER_10]: Right, right.

1696
02:09:28,851 --> 02:09:29,351
[SPEAKER_10]: I've heard of that.

1697
02:09:29,371 --> 02:09:32,111
[SPEAKER_10]: You can buy these cards or something that you use, right?

1698
02:09:32,971 --> 02:09:39,773
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, wasn't there a big story where they blew up a big carrier that was carrying a bunch of those cards and, like, all this game time was just lost?

1699
02:09:39,933 --> 02:09:41,173
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I forgot what it was.

1700
02:09:41,233 --> 02:09:43,913
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was some player who was really retarded.

1701
02:09:44,033 --> 02:09:47,614
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe you can put that stuff in your, like, a hanger and...

1702
02:09:48,254 --> 02:09:50,855
[SPEAKER_01]: He was retarded and kept it around and went with him for God knows why.

1703
02:09:50,915 --> 02:09:54,316
[SPEAKER_01]: So people heard about it, killed him, took game time.

1704
02:09:54,976 --> 02:09:55,436
[SPEAKER_01]: Your fault.

1705
02:09:55,896 --> 02:09:56,196
[SPEAKER_10]: Yikes.

1706
02:09:57,156 --> 02:09:57,436
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1707
02:09:57,476 --> 02:09:59,117
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, Death Wishing, we're going to let you go.

1708
02:09:59,417 --> 02:10:00,437
[SPEAKER_10]: But thanks for the call.

1709
02:10:01,077 --> 02:10:02,578
[SPEAKER_10]: And thanks for the webcam.

1710
02:10:02,858 --> 02:10:04,738
[SPEAKER_10]: It's interesting to see our listeners there.

1711
02:10:04,818 --> 02:10:07,179
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're not hooking one up so you can see us, though.

1712
02:10:07,239 --> 02:10:07,499
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1713
02:10:07,919 --> 02:10:08,479
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not fat.

1714
02:10:08,739 --> 02:10:09,459
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't worry about it.

1715
02:10:09,759 --> 02:10:10,600
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1716
02:10:10,640 --> 02:10:11,120
[SPEAKER_01]: Take care.

1717
02:10:11,200 --> 02:10:11,420
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1718
02:10:11,560 --> 02:10:11,880
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1719
02:10:11,920 --> 02:10:12,160
[SPEAKER_01]: Later.

1720
02:10:12,180 --> 02:10:12,960
[SPEAKER_01]: Mine rock time.

1721
02:10:13,020 --> 02:10:13,280
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye.

1722
02:10:16,829 --> 02:10:45,514
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to see more well maybe that's something I don't want to wish maybe I don't want to see more of the listeners but yeah sure why not call us with your webcams it'll be fun we want to see the sexy ones alright now the 877 number is apparently broken but there is a back door you can use 916-226-9067 I want to point out that is not a toll free number so if you don't have like a cell phone that has free nationwide long distance that number will not work it looks like someone's using that number right now hi you're on Orange Lawns Radio who's this

1723
02:10:46,838 --> 02:11:14,328
[SPEAKER_10]: it's Shane Miklatov whatever hey what's up Miklatov again I want to clarify 877 I don't know it's like I'm having problems with the phone constantly last week and now this week 877 number will not work something's up with the toll-free forwarder you can use the back door a 916-226-9067 please only use that if you have free long distance which a lot of cell phone companies do but be very very careful all right Miklatov what's on your mind

1724
02:11:16,074 --> 02:11:17,175
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, nothing.

1725
02:11:19,115 --> 02:11:20,316
[SPEAKER_10]: So you're just calling to say hey?

1726
02:11:21,996 --> 02:11:31,000
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I meant to call in last week, but I have a little anecdote that leads into a kind of stance I'm taking, I think.

1727
02:11:31,300 --> 02:11:32,120
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, let's hear it.

1728
02:11:33,121 --> 02:11:37,563
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so last week I was at work and we were doing a blood drive.

1729
02:11:39,263 --> 02:11:43,845
[SPEAKER_03]: So I go get blood, even though technically, legally, I'm not allowed to because laws are stupid.

1730
02:11:44,654 --> 02:11:51,097
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm sitting there giving blood, being all bored, and I bust out my phone and start playing some games on my phone.

1731
02:11:51,537 --> 02:11:52,557
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm having a really good time.

1732
02:11:52,577 --> 02:11:54,318
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes the time pass super quick.

1733
02:11:54,878 --> 02:11:56,419
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'm starting to think about this.

1734
02:11:56,519 --> 02:12:00,780
[SPEAKER_03]: I play games on my phone when I'm giving blood.

1735
02:12:01,180 --> 02:12:06,302
[SPEAKER_03]: I play games on my phone when I'm waiting at the drive-thru to pick up food or order or whatever.

1736
02:12:07,063 --> 02:12:10,164
[SPEAKER_03]: I play games at work when I am in the back

1737
02:12:11,143 --> 02:12:14,425
[SPEAKER_03]: looking for stuff or quote-unquote looking for stuff to put out.

1738
02:12:15,285 --> 02:12:22,928
[SPEAKER_03]: And it hits me that I feel like the mobile phone games now are really what's portable gaming.

1739
02:12:23,649 --> 02:12:24,849
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like the definition.

1740
02:12:25,229 --> 02:12:31,412
[SPEAKER_03]: And things like the Vita, the PSP, the DS, too big, too bulky to really be portable systems.

1741
02:12:31,472 --> 02:12:37,795
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really begin to realize that I only use those portably if I'm on a plane.

1742
02:12:38,740 --> 02:12:41,682
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise, I'm playing my portable systems at home.

1743
02:12:42,422 --> 02:12:50,527
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that Nintendo and Sony are going to find themselves in this same sort of mindset after a few years.

1744
02:12:50,607 --> 02:12:53,649
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, you know, those things are just too big and bulky.

1745
02:12:53,729 --> 02:12:59,072
[SPEAKER_03]: And the iPhone and the Android phone, their games are just way more accessible for

1746
02:12:59,795 --> 02:13:01,656
[SPEAKER_03]: Your portable gaming nowadays

1747
02:13:28,271 --> 02:13:31,053
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, okay, you all saw how well that worked out, right?

1748
02:13:31,393 --> 02:13:33,494
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's why Nintendo... It was a CDI.

1749
02:13:33,514 --> 02:13:34,495
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry, CDI.

1750
02:13:35,015 --> 02:13:35,356
[SPEAKER_10]: My bad.

1751
02:13:35,396 --> 02:13:37,577
[SPEAKER_10]: It was one of those 90s CD-based systems.

1752
02:13:37,917 --> 02:13:38,978
[SPEAKER_10]: So, okay, fine, the CDI.

1753
02:13:39,498 --> 02:13:40,999
[SPEAKER_10]: Clearly, that didn't work out well for them.

1754
02:13:41,039 --> 02:13:42,320
[SPEAKER_10]: They got fucking burned on that.

1755
02:13:42,340 --> 02:13:43,921
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think they created it.

1756
02:13:43,961 --> 02:13:45,862
[SPEAKER_02]: They just licensed the character out for it.

1757
02:13:45,882 --> 02:13:50,886
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, still, though, it just goes to show you how they're very protective of their shit, and they don't want to do that.

1758
02:13:50,926 --> 02:13:54,408
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, Nintendo's already kind of tested the waters with that, though.

1759
02:13:54,428 --> 02:13:56,029
[SPEAKER_03]: In Japan, they have that Pokemon...

1760
02:13:56,536 --> 02:13:59,217
[SPEAKER_03]: Trading Card Rhythm Game on the iPhone.

1761
02:13:59,257 --> 02:14:02,918
[SPEAKER_10]: The Pokemon company has tested, but that's not Nintendo themselves.

1762
02:14:02,958 --> 02:14:04,879
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but that's Nintendo's brand.

1763
02:14:04,939 --> 02:14:11,842
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, Pokemon is, I mean, yeah, it's Pokemon company, but you're not going to see Pokemon go over to Vita or Xbox.

1764
02:14:13,402 --> 02:14:17,886
[SPEAKER_10]: So you do bring up an interesting point, though, is that the only place a lot of people tend to play their portable gaming systems is at home.

1765
02:14:18,206 --> 02:14:20,248
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's kind of where I do a lot of my portable gaming, too.

1766
02:14:20,328 --> 02:14:29,215
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, I have my 3DS kind of by my bed, and maybe, like, when it's, you know, bedtime, quote-unquote, and I go into bed, and maybe I'll stay up for about 20 minutes and play the 3DS, you know?

1767
02:14:29,595 --> 02:14:31,577
[SPEAKER_10]: That's where I tend to do most of my portable gaming.

1768
02:14:32,558 --> 02:14:36,741
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and you know, at E3 this year, I had my PSP, which stayed in my hotel room.

1769
02:14:37,402 --> 02:14:41,365
[SPEAKER_03]: I had my 3DS, which I used to get StreetPass Tags.

1770
02:14:41,710 --> 02:14:52,677
[SPEAKER_03]: and then play their little mini dungeon game because I did not have time, even when standing in line, or not time, but I was not really comfortable holding that thing in my hand playing some game that's in-depth.

1771
02:14:52,958 --> 02:14:57,261
[SPEAKER_03]: Had I had something like Tiny Tower, I would have been all over my phone at that point.

1772
02:14:57,381 --> 02:14:59,262
[SPEAKER_03]: And I probably would have needed to...

1773
02:14:59,827 --> 02:15:02,709
[SPEAKER_03]: Bring a charger or something with me

1774
02:15:21,363 --> 02:15:22,264
[SPEAKER_10]: What did you do the street pass for?

1775
02:15:22,304 --> 02:15:24,325
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you do it to do that stupid fill in the puzzles?

1776
02:15:24,345 --> 02:15:26,727
[SPEAKER_10]: Or did you do it to do the stupid like

1777
02:15:43,150 --> 02:15:45,793
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do both when you street pass.

1778
02:15:47,254 --> 02:15:51,798
[SPEAKER_10]: When you meet a character and they go hello, it gives you their little URL.

1779
02:15:51,898 --> 02:15:56,763
[SPEAKER_10]: I was also street passing for Street Fighter 4 data and now I'll be street passing for Ridge Racer 3DS data.

1780
02:15:56,783 --> 02:15:58,124
[SPEAKER_10]: I want more ghosts to race against.

1781
02:15:59,424 --> 02:16:26,741
[SPEAKER_10]: I think there's a lot of really interesting things they can do with StreetPass I just don't think any of the games out right now really sell that stuff very well but I'm interested to see what future games can kind of think up with the StreetPassing that's very interesting to me but I'm not to say I'm totally disagreeing with you because I think part of the reason the 3DS isn't selling does have to do with the fact that mobile phones are doing it in some ways better definitely cheaper

1782
02:16:28,222 --> 02:16:34,507
[SPEAKER_10]: and I think the price of portable games needs to come down to stay competitive with iOS games.

1783
02:16:34,927 --> 02:16:40,971
[SPEAKER_10]: I think charging $40 for a 3DS game isn't going to fly and I think they're going to be in for a rude awakening pretty soon.

1784
02:16:41,011 --> 02:16:44,673
[SPEAKER_10]: If they can't get that price down to $20, kiss it goodbye.

1785
02:16:46,494 --> 02:16:47,695
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1786
02:16:47,955 --> 02:16:49,997
[SPEAKER_03]: I look at my portable games I'm playing right now.

1787
02:16:50,357 --> 02:16:54,940
[SPEAKER_03]: I pick up Zelda since it's launched maybe once every week and a half.

1788
02:16:55,450 --> 02:17:03,192
[SPEAKER_03]: and then I bust out my phone to play Groove Coaster or Tiny Tower or Juke Beat which I actually like a lot.

1789
02:17:03,392 --> 02:17:03,512
[SPEAKER_03]: Ew.

1790
02:17:04,353 --> 02:17:05,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Juke Beat's terrible.

1791
02:17:06,613 --> 02:17:07,094
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I love it.

1792
02:17:07,194 --> 02:17:08,494
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

1793
02:17:08,534 --> 02:17:12,895
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you download any of the download content stuff for Juke Beat?

1794
02:17:13,716 --> 02:17:15,036
[SPEAKER_03]: No, because they're all terrible sounding.

1795
02:17:15,056 --> 02:17:15,116
[SPEAKER_03]: See?

1796
02:17:15,156 --> 02:17:15,316
[SPEAKER_03]: See?

1797
02:17:15,396 --> 02:17:15,456
[SPEAKER_03]: See?

1798
02:17:19,966 --> 02:17:21,168
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's just to start.

1799
02:17:21,208 --> 02:17:23,292
[SPEAKER_03]: The three that they have you begin with are awesome.

1800
02:17:23,712 --> 02:17:26,397
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that Contra song, and even the Frogger song's pretty good.

1801
02:17:26,457 --> 02:17:27,158
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll give you that.

1802
02:17:27,198 --> 02:17:29,322
[SPEAKER_10]: The Contra and Frogger songs are kind of cool.

1803
02:17:29,482 --> 02:17:30,023
[SPEAKER_10]: Kind of.

1804
02:17:30,484 --> 02:17:33,489
[SPEAKER_03]: And it is really too hard, but it's still...

1805
02:17:45,521 --> 02:17:47,842
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm playing Tiny Tower right now while you're trying to talk.

1806
02:17:48,022 --> 02:17:50,524
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm half paying attention to you, I'm half restocking all my stores.

1807
02:17:51,244 --> 02:17:53,726
[SPEAKER_10]: Because now Bobby had to go and make it a contest.

1808
02:17:54,546 --> 02:17:54,766
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

1809
02:17:54,786 --> 02:17:58,208
[SPEAKER_03]: I said I was doing that and then I called in.

1810
02:17:58,949 --> 02:18:00,790
[SPEAKER_10]: And then you go right back to it.

1811
02:18:01,789 --> 02:18:04,454
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that and wow, I'm just like, oh, I'm flying somewhere.

1812
02:18:04,474 --> 02:18:11,247
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I gotta check on my supplies, make sure everything's stocked up, and I just upgraded my elevator, so it's going faster, and I love it.

1813
02:18:11,808 --> 02:18:13,431
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, it changed the game completely for me.

1814
02:18:14,594 --> 02:18:15,154
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I still am.

1815
02:18:16,595 --> 02:18:16,935
[SPEAKER_10]: I love that.

1816
02:18:16,955 --> 02:18:23,617
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, because I don't foresee me going outside and busting out my Vita and playing Uncharted because that is not a game...

1817
02:18:44,284 --> 02:18:45,965
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, that you want portable.

1818
02:18:46,045 --> 02:18:54,068
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to sit down and experience this awesome game with best headphones and all sorts of being comfortable.

1819
02:18:54,108 --> 02:18:57,810
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to stand on a bus or in a subway playing Uncharted.

1820
02:18:59,330 --> 02:19:00,271
[SPEAKER_10]: One more comment from chat.

1821
02:19:00,291 --> 02:19:01,671
[SPEAKER_10]: I got to let you guys get some more calls.

1822
02:19:01,691 --> 02:19:04,592
[SPEAKER_10]: But Kaijudo in the chatroom says, phones are not killing the 3DS.

1823
02:19:04,672 --> 02:19:06,973
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the lack of anything on the 3DS that's killing it.

1824
02:19:07,033 --> 02:19:08,113
[SPEAKER_10]: And I kind of tend to agree.

1825
02:19:08,193 --> 02:19:09,774
[SPEAKER_10]: That's really the 3DS' biggest problem.

1826
02:19:09,794 --> 02:19:13,295
[SPEAKER_10]: But I also think the price of the games is really an issue.

1827
02:19:13,415 --> 02:19:15,956
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I think it's more of an issue than Nintendo wants to admit.

1828
02:19:16,316 --> 02:19:21,738
[SPEAKER_10]: I realize games are expensive to make, but there has to come a point where you go, we're not selling these games at $40.

1829
02:19:22,478 --> 02:19:24,459
[SPEAKER_10]: We have to cut the price to get these to sell.

1830
02:19:24,999 --> 02:19:27,340
[SPEAKER_10]: And maybe we'll sell three times as much.

1831
02:19:27,560 --> 02:19:27,900
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, go on.

1832
02:19:28,393 --> 02:19:28,753
[SPEAKER_10]: No, go ahead.

1833
02:19:29,354 --> 02:19:46,842
[SPEAKER_03]: I really hope that this price cut and then realizing how bad the system is doing forces them to make an actual, real, honest-to-goodness 3D Pokemon game that's not some spin-off like the new one in Japan, because, I mean, that would get me to buy four more systems, even though I have one.

1834
02:19:46,902 --> 02:19:49,864
[SPEAKER_03]: And I plan on getting that red one, too, just to have a red one.

1835
02:19:49,924 --> 02:19:51,084
[SPEAKER_10]: Just to have a flamey red one?

1836
02:19:52,185 --> 02:19:58,108
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I had a red and a blue SP when they came out, so I can do a red and a blue 3DS, I decided.

1837
02:19:58,128 --> 02:19:58,188
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

1838
02:20:05,286 --> 02:20:05,766
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

1839
02:20:06,727 --> 02:20:09,028
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I'm going to let you go so we can get some more calls, alright?

1840
02:20:10,068 --> 02:20:10,809
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, sounds good.

1841
02:20:10,849 --> 02:20:11,389
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for the call.

1842
02:20:12,470 --> 02:20:12,950
[SPEAKER_10]: No problem.

1843
02:20:13,030 --> 02:20:13,270
[SPEAKER_10]: Later.

1844
02:20:15,450 --> 02:20:40,038
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, give us a call at area code 916-226-9067 Again, not toll free, the toll free number is down right now Or call us on Skype, that's always free Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype I'll get to the Twitter topics in just a moment here Let's see, I'm trying to get through some of these here Trying to get through the feedback for last week's show and so forth What is this?

1845
02:20:40,418 --> 02:20:42,479
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm trying to see if this is a story we've already covered

1846
02:20:44,973 --> 02:20:49,336
[SPEAKER_10]: No, this is something that EricRPG tweeted us, and this is about Nintendo 3DS.

1847
02:20:49,396 --> 02:20:52,898
[SPEAKER_10]: Could a new Fire Emblem game be on its way to the Nintendo 3DS?

1848
02:20:53,758 --> 02:21:00,963
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently, an online gaming site called The Magic Box posted that a new Fire Emblem game will be announced by Nintendo fairly soon.

1849
02:21:01,323 --> 02:21:05,205
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently, it's called Fire Emblem Blue Sacred Sword and Red Demon Lance.

1850
02:21:05,225 --> 02:21:12,610
[SPEAKER_10]: It's supposed to be 100 years after Sealed Sword, and the story will center around the Princess of Kingdom Burn and the Prince of Kingdom Lycia.

1851
02:21:13,190 --> 02:21:15,473
[SPEAKER_10]: and each will have a different story in their perspective.

1852
02:21:15,513 --> 02:21:20,458
[SPEAKER_10]: There will also be a new casual mode for beginners and lunatic mode for advanced players.

1853
02:21:20,878 --> 02:21:25,663
[SPEAKER_10]: No word on where this information is coming from, but sounds good enough to me.

1854
02:21:26,063 --> 02:21:26,424
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1855
02:21:26,604 --> 02:21:29,587
[SPEAKER_10]: Fire Emblem on 3DS seems like a logical next step, don't you think?

1856
02:21:29,987 --> 02:21:31,328
[SPEAKER_10]: Sounds like an educated guess to me.

1857
02:21:31,348 --> 02:21:32,670
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1858
02:21:34,979 --> 02:21:41,124
[SPEAKER_10]: Spazernator PSN tweets us saying, OLR, could you please say hi to your newest listener, Shirley, in Arizona, please?

1859
02:21:41,825 --> 02:21:42,205
[SPEAKER_10]: Shirley!

1860
02:21:42,726 --> 02:21:43,406
[SPEAKER_10]: Shirley, we will.

1861
02:21:43,947 --> 02:21:44,147
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi.

1862
02:21:44,167 --> 02:21:44,908
[SPEAKER_10]: You just did, right?

1863
02:21:45,568 --> 02:21:45,788
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1864
02:21:45,908 --> 02:21:50,512
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, and I'm sure that's a pun that Shirley is terribly sick of hearing.

1865
02:21:50,893 --> 02:21:52,374
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, let's go to the phones and get more calls.

1866
02:21:52,414 --> 02:21:53,315
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.

1867
02:21:53,335 --> 02:21:54,095
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

1868
02:21:54,115 --> 02:21:55,016
[SPEAKER_00]: Sludgeon Zaku here.

1869
02:21:55,096 --> 02:21:56,197
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Zaku, what's on your mind?

1870
02:21:57,438 --> 02:22:01,902
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing much, just trying to recover from Ramna's barbecue we held at his place yesterday.

1871
02:22:03,840 --> 02:22:04,660
[SPEAKER_00]: What's this all about?

1872
02:22:04,700 --> 02:22:05,780
[SPEAKER_10]: What was happening at the barbecue?

1873
02:22:06,821 --> 02:22:12,042
[SPEAKER_00]: Bacon-wrapped sausage, a lot of food, a lot of, like, raunchy card games.

1874
02:22:12,062 --> 02:22:17,383
[SPEAKER_00]: We were just, like, drawing and using Sharpies against other people while they were passed out.

1875
02:22:19,283 --> 02:22:20,083
[SPEAKER_10]: Like Jigglypuff.

1876
02:22:21,084 --> 02:22:22,624
[SPEAKER_00]: It was exactly like that.

1877
02:22:23,164 --> 02:22:24,664
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, God, I can't believe it.

1878
02:22:25,244 --> 02:22:27,065
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll probably fill you in on the details.

1879
02:22:27,285 --> 02:22:27,865
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways...

1880
02:22:29,318 --> 02:22:33,205
[SPEAKER_00]: So, they were mentioning Activision being the new devil.

1881
02:22:33,686 --> 02:22:38,474
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think they're the new devil.

1882
02:22:38,534 --> 02:22:40,798
[SPEAKER_10]: They've been the devil for at least a good year.

1883
02:22:41,755 --> 02:22:54,083
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, I know that's still debatable, but I mean, they're like, I don't know, it's like EA is starting to go back into the dark side, but then again, they've been doing pretty well ever since going away from it.

1884
02:22:54,523 --> 02:23:03,549
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter, staying in that point where you're making money, but you don't piss off the fanbase like Activision does by just shoveling out crap.

1885
02:23:04,502 --> 02:23:17,816
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I mean, you know, the way I see it right now is that Activision's trying to make amends by doing dedicated servers for Modern Warfare 3, but God knows what restrictions they will have.

1886
02:23:17,876 --> 02:23:26,205
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, we don't know whether they're just going to be, like, rent-a-servers, or there's better, or it's like a full no-strings-attached ones, like, you know, like in Call of Duty 4.

1887
02:23:28,004 --> 02:23:35,811
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, when Activision tries to throw out something like that, I don't even think it's them being genuine about it.

1888
02:23:35,831 --> 02:23:43,197
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just them trying to capitalize, trying to sweep, trying to bury all their transgressions that they did in the past.

1889
02:23:43,217 --> 02:23:47,461
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just trying to bury it, trying to kiss and make up.

1890
02:23:48,822 --> 02:23:51,344
[SPEAKER_00]: And that right there is just not really sincere.

1891
02:23:51,844 --> 02:23:52,705
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's a company.

1892
02:23:52,725 --> 02:23:53,566
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course they're not sincere.

1893
02:23:54,474 --> 02:24:08,332
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't understand, but when they treated but if you remember how that whole Modern Warfare 2 on PC that whole thing went out that whole thing panned out where they got rid of the dedicated servers and you see a bunch of folks just like

1894
02:24:09,517 --> 02:24:13,861
[SPEAKER_00]: They basically said, to hell with Activision, it's not worth it.

1895
02:24:14,382 --> 02:24:15,122
[SPEAKER_00]: I was one of them.

1896
02:24:16,063 --> 02:24:23,831
[SPEAKER_00]: I was really hyped up for Modern Warfare 2 that year until that news broke, and I just lost interest, and I got back company 2 instead.

1897
02:24:24,211 --> 02:24:32,439
[SPEAKER_02]: You're talking about all those people that decided, hey, we're going to basically form a group that's going to boycott Modern Warfare 2, and then they were all playing Modern Warfare 2.

1898
02:24:32,479 --> 02:24:33,660
[SPEAKER_00]: I just stuck to my guns.

1899
02:24:34,982 --> 02:24:58,998
[SPEAKER_00]: if you look at my Steam profile I don't have that game I have Call of Duty 4 I mean the last good one with dedicated servers it's like I basically have not I've never played Modern Warfare 2 not even in consoles SSJ100 Matt is in the chat room hold on because I have to get this out here because this is kind of funny is saying correction Bobby Kotick is the new devil Activision would be fine without him there you agree?

1900
02:24:59,758 --> 02:25:02,801
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, I guess that's what I was trying to refer to.

1901
02:25:02,861 --> 02:25:06,884
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, he is personifying the evil intentions of the devil.

1902
02:25:07,585 --> 02:25:08,966
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, him and his company.

1903
02:25:10,677 --> 02:25:26,860
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I mean, it's like, after seeing the 64-player multiplayer video for Battlefield 3 this week, I mean, like last week during Gamescom, it's like, I don't have any incentive to buy Modern Warfare 3 anymore.

1904
02:25:26,900 --> 02:25:39,002
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, sure, they may throw in dedicated servers, but you're going to get your money's worth in terms of production values and gameplay out of Battlefield 3, just by the looks of it.

1905
02:25:39,822 --> 02:25:42,183
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you going for a console version or PC version?

1906
02:25:42,523 --> 02:25:42,823
[SPEAKER_00]: Both.

1907
02:25:43,023 --> 02:25:45,204
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean... What do you think of the origin stuff?

1908
02:25:45,504 --> 02:25:53,826
[SPEAKER_00]: Granted, the console's like, what, 24 players and obviously the PC's more, but it's still pretty good from both spectrums.

1909
02:25:53,846 --> 02:25:55,106
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you think of the origin?

1910
02:25:55,126 --> 02:25:58,447
[SPEAKER_00]: All that Modern Warfare 3 is just doing is rehashing perks.

1911
02:25:59,027 --> 02:25:59,347
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.

1912
02:25:59,367 --> 02:25:59,988
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all it is.

1913
02:26:01,868 --> 02:26:08,310
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole basis is the more kills you get, the more balance you tip against the others.

1914
02:26:09,470 --> 02:26:14,475
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, UAV, just spamming UAV airstrikes and so forth.

1915
02:26:15,216 --> 02:26:17,819
[SPEAKER_10]: What about the fact that on PC you're forced to use Origin?

1916
02:26:19,640 --> 02:26:20,061
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

1917
02:26:20,101 --> 02:26:22,123
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm kind of indifferent about it.

1918
02:26:22,744 --> 02:26:29,951
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I was holding out for them having to sell it on Steam, but at this point, I may give it a shot.

1919
02:26:30,611 --> 02:26:32,393
[SPEAKER_00]: Because at the end of the day...

1920
02:26:33,504 --> 02:26:56,962
[SPEAKER_00]: it's it's like the same it's like what what Valve went through when they first released Half-Life 2 like when they first launched Steam they were basically they were completely dead set against it they just hated it they just hated its guts from the get-go and now it's pretty much one of the top digital districts the top digital distributors it's the thing to have on PC right now it's kind of the cool kids club

1921
02:26:57,774 --> 02:27:06,037
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand, but as I said, it's like, or EA's going to go through their own steam moment when launching.

1922
02:27:07,138 --> 02:27:16,362
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, if EA can basically pass that test in terms of providing a decent alternative to steam, then more power to them.

1923
02:27:17,962 --> 02:27:24,625
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as they bring it on par with it, then it'll be an easier pill to swallow.

1924
02:27:24,985 --> 02:27:26,486
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't be like eating a shit sandwich.

1925
02:27:27,222 --> 02:27:35,044
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, I gotta let you go so we can get more calls, but I gotta say this, I wanna know when the next barbecue is happening, because I may need to come back out to New York for that, and I'm gonna draw all of your faces.

1926
02:27:35,064 --> 02:27:35,724
[SPEAKER_00]: Try next summer.

1927
02:27:36,404 --> 02:27:37,084
[SPEAKER_10]: Next summer?

1928
02:27:37,645 --> 02:27:42,066
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, Adam, Ranma is only gonna hold, only holds them like once a year.

1929
02:27:42,766 --> 02:27:46,427
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe Labor Day, but I don't think Ranma, I demand one in my honor.

1930
02:27:47,447 --> 02:27:49,307
[SPEAKER_10]: Ranma will throw one in my honor if I come visit.

1931
02:27:50,268 --> 02:27:51,328
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I'm pretty sure he will.

1932
02:27:51,548 --> 02:27:52,268
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, awesome.

1933
02:27:53,188 --> 02:27:53,788
[SPEAKER_10]: I get what I want.

1934
02:27:54,068 --> 02:27:55,989
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, take care, Zaku, thanks for the call.

1935
02:27:58,287 --> 02:28:24,998
[SPEAKER_10]: I love the New York contingent we have a lot of fans in New York I don't know how it happened well I guess there's a lot of people in New York so it makes sense but still we have quite a few listeners there so I would I need to go back and say hello it's been far too long I need to go New York is so much fun oh my god you need to go see Mistress Tia because I love that bitch if people will send me a ticket I'll go I'm not even playing that's not how it works

1936
02:28:25,738 --> 02:28:26,619
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, Jamie's broke.

1937
02:28:27,619 --> 02:28:27,939
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

1938
02:28:29,700 --> 02:28:31,501
[SPEAKER_10]: Hold out for another one of those JetBlue sales, man.

1939
02:28:31,521 --> 02:28:33,442
[SPEAKER_10]: They go cheap sometimes.

1940
02:28:33,802 --> 02:28:37,484
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we got enough listeners out there that they could send us tickets.

1941
02:28:37,584 --> 02:28:38,664
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't see why they don't.

1942
02:28:39,184 --> 02:28:40,565
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but then you owe them something.

1943
02:28:41,588 --> 02:28:42,489
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1944
02:29:09,345 --> 02:29:09,766
[SPEAKER_10]: Iowa?

1945
02:29:10,206 --> 02:29:10,547
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1946
02:29:11,468 --> 02:29:11,828
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.

1947
02:29:13,210 --> 02:29:18,375
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a lengthy article from Gamasutra, and I didn't read this in advance, so gosh, I don't even know where to start here.

1948
02:29:18,416 --> 02:29:19,417
[SPEAKER_10]: We are still seeing calls, by the way.

1949
02:29:19,477 --> 02:29:20,498
[SPEAKER_10]: Orange Launch Radio on Skype.

1950
02:29:21,359 --> 02:29:22,420
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, it's ringing right now.

1951
02:29:22,700 --> 02:29:24,122
[SPEAKER_10]: Good, that'll give me time to skim this article.

1952
02:29:25,123 --> 02:29:25,984
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1953
02:29:26,004 --> 02:29:26,344
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

1954
02:29:26,865 --> 02:29:28,186
[SPEAKER_10]: This is Brad from PodCulture.

1955
02:29:28,226 --> 02:29:29,448
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, Brad from PodCulture.

1956
02:29:29,468 --> 02:29:30,089
[SPEAKER_10]: What's on your mind, buddy?

1957
02:29:30,997 --> 02:29:32,098
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, not a whole lot.

1958
02:29:32,898 --> 02:29:36,639
[SPEAKER_05]: Finally joined the contingent and picked up a 3D last week.

1959
02:29:37,340 --> 02:29:37,520
[SPEAKER_05]: 3DS.

1960
02:29:38,500 --> 02:29:40,001
[SPEAKER_10]: Was this after the price drop, I'm assuming?

1961
02:29:40,541 --> 02:29:40,741
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1962
02:29:41,241 --> 02:29:41,982
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, and how was it?

1963
02:29:43,122 --> 02:29:45,183
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's actually a pretty neat little system.

1964
02:29:46,584 --> 02:29:47,524
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm actually digging it.

1965
02:29:48,324 --> 02:29:50,265
[SPEAKER_05]: Not much in the way of games out yet, though.

1966
02:29:50,885 --> 02:29:51,826
[SPEAKER_05]: No, there's not.

1967
02:29:51,906 --> 02:29:54,387
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there something you're looking forward to that's coming out?

1968
02:29:55,562 --> 02:29:56,342
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, no?

1969
02:29:56,603 --> 02:29:58,743
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm pretty satisfied with the two that I've got right now.

1970
02:29:58,763 --> 02:29:59,484
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you have right now?

1971
02:29:59,884 --> 02:30:03,005
[SPEAKER_05]: DOA Dimensions and, uh, Ridge Racer 3D.

1972
02:30:04,025 --> 02:30:04,305
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice.

1973
02:30:04,926 --> 02:30:08,347
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of 3D boobies and DOA, I'm sure.

1974
02:30:09,252 --> 02:30:11,174
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I've always liked the DOA franchise.

1975
02:30:11,814 --> 02:30:13,096
[SPEAKER_10]: Hmm, a lot of guys do.

1976
02:30:14,497 --> 02:30:15,198
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me ask you this.

1977
02:30:15,798 --> 02:30:20,202
[SPEAKER_10]: What kind of made you decide to take the plunge and buy the three?

1978
02:30:20,222 --> 02:30:32,173
[SPEAKER_05]: The fact that the Evil G had the, if you're one of the Power Rewards members or whatever the hell membership thing that they got, if you trade in a DS Lite, you can pick it up for 99 bucks.

1979
02:30:33,946 --> 02:30:45,871
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, okay, so you did the whole, like, the Evil G. I like that, by the way, the Evil G. I had a... True story, this is not going to make sense to anyone, but I just have to say this, because, you know, some teachers that you have in your past stay with you forever.

1980
02:30:46,191 --> 02:30:54,975
[SPEAKER_10]: And I had an awesome, awesome music teacher in junior high school, and his name was Mr. Gonzalez, but everybody called him Mr. G. Like, that was the name he went by for short.

1981
02:30:55,535 --> 02:30:58,297
[SPEAKER_10]: And he's a great... Oh, man, I wish I knew what he was up to these days.

1982
02:30:58,337 --> 02:30:59,197
[SPEAKER_10]: I wonder if he's still teaching.

1983
02:30:59,517 --> 02:31:00,838
[SPEAKER_10]: But anyhow, when you say Evil G...

1984
02:31:02,018 --> 02:31:05,862
[SPEAKER_10]: For whatever reason, that just triggers a response in my mind where I see his evil twin.

1985
02:31:08,304 --> 02:31:09,305
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I mean?

1986
02:31:09,565 --> 02:31:19,394
[SPEAKER_10]: But I like that as a name for GameStop, Evil G. So you bought into the Evil G's trade-in scheme, which is I can't fault you for a good deal, so it's fine.

1987
02:31:19,734 --> 02:31:21,356
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's what made you finally take the plunge.

1988
02:31:22,437 --> 02:31:23,338
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, definitely.

1989
02:31:24,078 --> 02:31:26,140
[SPEAKER_05]: I had thought about picking one up when they came out, but ooh, $250.

1990
02:31:26,180 --> 02:31:26,300
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm-hmm.

1991
02:31:28,872 --> 02:31:30,073
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a little much.

1992
02:31:30,613 --> 02:31:32,034
[SPEAKER_05]: Wouldn't you pick up one for about $100?

1993
02:31:32,074 --> 02:31:33,435
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.

1994
02:31:34,435 --> 02:31:36,456
[SPEAKER_05]: And considering that's what I paid for my DS Lite?

1995
02:31:37,177 --> 02:31:37,437
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1996
02:31:37,788 --> 02:31:45,111
[SPEAKER_10]: So what did you think about, we had a call a little bit ago that was talking about, I don't really use my portable game systems portably.

1997
02:31:46,291 --> 02:31:52,093
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you find that your gaming habits are similar, or do you think that you might actually get more use out of this on the go?

1998
02:31:53,314 --> 02:31:57,315
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm interested in taking it to DragonCon and see what I can do with the street pass function.

1999
02:31:57,475 --> 02:31:58,996
[SPEAKER_10]: You'll get a shit ton there, I'm sure.

2000
02:31:59,656 --> 02:32:01,797
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't even imagine a pass.

2001
02:32:01,817 --> 02:32:03,598
[SPEAKER_05]: But other than that, my ass is sitting on the couch.

2002
02:32:03,958 --> 02:32:04,138
[SPEAKER_10]: Mm-hmm.

2003
02:32:05,999 --> 02:32:09,642
[SPEAKER_10]: I see, so you're couch surfing and playing the 3DS.

2004
02:32:09,662 --> 02:32:10,062
[SPEAKER_10]: That's fine.

2005
02:32:10,082 --> 02:32:11,684
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a lot of folks.

2006
02:32:12,845 --> 02:32:15,407
[SPEAKER_05]: No, Bobby, I didn't steal your name for GameStop.

2007
02:32:15,427 --> 02:32:18,029
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think I heard?

2008
02:32:18,369 --> 02:32:20,831
[SPEAKER_10]: Bobby's throwing a tantrum in chat right now, Brad.

2009
02:32:20,851 --> 02:32:22,192
[SPEAKER_10]: You need to go address this.

2010
02:32:25,735 --> 02:32:31,399
[SPEAKER_10]: He's just mad because his tiny bitizens are revolting because they don't want his tower to get bigger than mine.

2011
02:32:31,639 --> 02:32:32,640
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, they stink on ice.

2012
02:32:35,528 --> 02:32:38,731
[SPEAKER_10]: So Brad, there's some new games coming out for the 3DS this holiday.

2013
02:32:39,351 --> 02:32:43,074
[SPEAKER_10]: There's the new Mario game, the new Mario Kart game.

2014
02:32:43,134 --> 02:32:44,194
[SPEAKER_10]: Any of this stuff look interesting?

2015
02:32:44,935 --> 02:32:48,277
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I like Mario Kart, so that's definitely worth a look.

2016
02:32:49,538 --> 02:32:50,639
[SPEAKER_05]: May pick that up.

2017
02:32:51,994 --> 02:33:14,909
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely, I think it is going to be worth picking up So, well, I hope you have a lot of fun at DragonCon And I hope you are able to street pass with tons and tons of people And I hope you win lots of awards that I hear you're nominated for That apparently Bobby was not Hence some of the tantrum that's going on in there No, he was nominated, I don't just We weren't nominated either You were nominated Were we?

2018
02:33:15,765 --> 02:33:19,867
[SPEAKER_05]: You didn't make it as a finalist, I don't think.

2019
02:33:20,067 --> 02:33:20,308
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, well.

2020
02:33:21,008 --> 02:33:22,009
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty sure you were nominated.

2021
02:33:22,469 --> 02:33:22,749
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

2022
02:33:22,789 --> 02:33:24,670
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't see any emails on it this year, but oh, well.

2023
02:33:24,910 --> 02:33:25,330
[SPEAKER_10]: It's all good.

2024
02:33:26,451 --> 02:33:26,871
[SPEAKER_10]: I ain't mad.

2025
02:33:29,133 --> 02:33:35,236
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, if you can get in on the deal for the 3DS, go ahead and check it out.

2026
02:33:35,716 --> 02:33:36,357
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a lot of fun.

2027
02:33:37,297 --> 02:33:37,637
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2028
02:33:38,258 --> 02:33:38,718
[SPEAKER_10]: Sounds good.

2029
02:33:38,758 --> 02:33:40,759
[SPEAKER_10]: Another raving endorsement for the 3DS.

2030
02:33:41,079 --> 02:33:41,279
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2031
02:33:41,299 --> 02:33:43,200
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, Brad, buddy, we're going to let you go so we can wrap things up.

2032
02:33:43,320 --> 02:33:43,981
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks so much for the call.

2033
02:33:44,542 --> 02:33:44,822
[SPEAKER_05]: All righty.

2034
02:33:44,962 --> 02:33:45,403
[SPEAKER_10]: Later, guys.

2035
02:34:12,079 --> 02:34:12,419
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.

2036
02:34:12,559 --> 02:34:15,801
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently these guys want to set up some type of collectible museum.

2037
02:34:15,841 --> 02:34:17,842
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the guys that are behind the Classic Gaming Expo.

2038
02:34:17,862 --> 02:34:22,885
[SPEAKER_10]: This is all a tweet to a story on a Gamasutra that TigerClaw sent us via Twitter.

2039
02:34:23,745 --> 02:34:27,027
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently they're the folks behind Classic Gaming Expo.

2040
02:34:27,307 --> 02:34:35,111
[SPEAKER_10]: They've got a collection of 30,000 items that they want to put into a permanent official home where folks can research, document, and so forth.

2041
02:34:35,411 --> 02:34:38,853
[SPEAKER_10]: But they need $30,000 to set up the base in Silicon Valley and

2042
02:34:39,253 --> 02:35:00,103
[SPEAKER_10]: and they got less than two weeks to go to do it and they don't even have half of the money that they need to do it so it's not looking too good and I guess a lot of the backers just don't have an idea where the money is going and you know I guess what they're going to get out of it so to speak so some of the collection shows off at trade shows and all that stuff so they want to do it but um

2043
02:35:01,284 --> 02:35:02,585
[SPEAKER_10]: It sounds like they may not hit it.

2044
02:35:03,386 --> 02:35:03,927
[SPEAKER_10]: That's too bad.

2045
02:35:03,967 --> 02:35:06,189
[SPEAKER_10]: It would be nice to have a video game museum of sorts.

2046
02:35:06,310 --> 02:35:12,677
[SPEAKER_10]: And Silicon Valley definitely is a much more logical place to put it than whatever the fuck Iowa.

2047
02:35:13,998 --> 02:35:14,239
[SPEAKER_10]: But...

2048
02:35:16,220 --> 02:35:20,801
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I can see where they're having problems selling an idea like that.

2049
02:35:20,821 --> 02:35:29,043
[SPEAKER_10]: What they might want to do is maybe try to have it as an expansion to some type of museum that already exists that speaks to nerds' interests.

2050
02:35:29,164 --> 02:35:37,146
[SPEAKER_10]: One really cool place I went to last year was the Sci-Fi Museum in Seattle, which is attached to the Experience Music Project, which is a neat little museum.

2051
02:35:37,646 --> 02:35:42,527
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe there's a place in that whole thing that they could fit a video game tribute into.

2052
02:35:43,107 --> 02:35:44,148
[SPEAKER_10]: That might be the way to do it.

2053
02:35:44,208 --> 02:35:47,009
[SPEAKER_10]: I know San Jose has a technology museum that's pretty awesome.

2054
02:35:47,090 --> 02:35:47,990
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe just come to my house.

2055
02:35:50,672 --> 02:35:51,692
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe that's the way to do it.

2056
02:35:52,313 --> 02:35:52,613
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2057
02:35:54,114 --> 02:35:54,594
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go.

2058
02:35:54,674 --> 02:35:56,575
[SPEAKER_10]: That's going to do it for another show.

2059
02:35:56,795 --> 02:35:58,136
[SPEAKER_10]: But first, I need to make sure.

2060
02:35:58,176 --> 02:35:58,856
[SPEAKER_10]: Last minute stories?

2061
02:35:59,237 --> 02:35:59,477
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes?

2062
02:35:59,577 --> 02:35:59,737
[SPEAKER_10]: No?

2063
02:35:59,897 --> 02:36:00,317
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe so?

2064
02:36:01,678 --> 02:36:03,319
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just dropping grenades on ants.

2065
02:36:03,459 --> 02:36:05,560
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, so you're too busy fighting insects to do last minute stories.

2066
02:36:05,580 --> 02:36:05,901
[SPEAKER_10]: That's fine.

2067
02:36:06,201 --> 02:36:06,501
[SPEAKER_10]: It's cool.

2068
02:36:06,892 --> 02:36:08,153
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we have some Last Minute Stories.

2069
02:36:08,233 --> 02:36:09,434
[SPEAKER_02]: I can talk about them if you want.

2070
02:36:09,714 --> 02:36:11,195
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, please, let's.

2071
02:36:12,256 --> 02:36:13,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's see.

2072
02:36:13,297 --> 02:36:19,421
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a couple of music games coming out this fall, and we can talk a little bit about what tracks will be featured in said games.

2073
02:36:20,642 --> 02:36:22,964
[SPEAKER_02]: Starting with, of course, Dance Central 2.

2074
02:36:23,024 --> 02:36:26,707
[SPEAKER_02]: They announced an initial song list, including some of the songs.

2075
02:36:26,727 --> 02:36:29,889
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it Sexy Chick by David Guetta and Akon?

2076
02:36:30,890 --> 02:36:33,252
[SPEAKER_02]: Daddy Yankee featuring Fergie with Impacto.

2077
02:36:33,812 --> 02:36:35,253
[SPEAKER_02]: Darude with Sandstorm.

2078
02:36:35,513 --> 02:36:36,194
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty funny.

2079
02:36:36,894 --> 02:36:50,145
[SPEAKER_02]: Death Punk with Technologic, Bruno Mars with Grenade, Ozone with Dragoste Dente.

2080
02:36:50,305 --> 02:36:51,586
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the Numa Numa song.

2081
02:36:52,067 --> 02:36:52,407
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

2082
02:36:52,487 --> 02:36:53,348
[SPEAKER_02]: You know?

2083
02:36:53,608 --> 02:36:54,889
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember the guy sitting in his chair?

2084
02:36:54,909 --> 02:36:56,530
[SPEAKER_06]: Ayahi, my yaku...

2085

02:37:52,999 --> 02:37:59,823
[SPEAKER_02]: 2 Unlimited with No Limit, AHA with Take On Me, BananaRama with Venus.

2088
02:38:00,963 --> 02:38:01,964
[SPEAKER_10]: I have some new stuff in there, though.

2089
02:38:01,984 --> 02:38:03,865
[SPEAKER_10]: I see LMFAO and the Party Rock Anthem.

2090
02:38:03,905 --> 02:38:05,326
[SPEAKER_10]: That's like a big song right now.

2091
02:38:05,386 --> 02:38:06,206
[SPEAKER_02]: That is pretty cool.

2092
02:38:06,827 --> 02:38:09,988
[SPEAKER_10]: A cover of Boogie Wonderland, looks like.

2093
02:38:10,629 --> 02:38:12,550
[SPEAKER_10]: Katy Perry with California Girls.

2094
02:38:12,690 --> 02:38:13,770
[SPEAKER_10]: Alan will be so happy to hear that.

2095
02:38:13,810 --> 02:38:14,631
[SPEAKER_10]: He loves Katy Perry.

2096
02:38:19,093 --> 02:38:19,693
[SPEAKER_10]: I like Mika.

2097
02:38:19,713 --> 02:38:20,554
[SPEAKER_10]: I see Mika's in there.

2098
02:38:20,899 --> 02:38:23,200
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a pretty round set list.

2099
02:38:23,380 --> 02:38:24,980
[SPEAKER_10]: They're saying that may not be the whole thing?

2100
02:38:25,480 --> 02:38:26,460
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if that's the whole thing.

2101
02:38:27,421 --> 02:38:30,921
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that for the Wii and the PS3 and 360?

2102
02:38:31,201 --> 02:38:32,562
[SPEAKER_10]: So it is going to be on all of them this time?

2103
02:38:32,982 --> 02:38:33,222
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

2104
02:38:33,702 --> 02:38:33,922
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice.

2105
02:38:34,522 --> 02:38:38,463
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, it's interesting.

2106
02:38:39,383 --> 02:38:42,064
[SPEAKER_02]: And they even have Crazy Little Thing Called Love by Queen.

2107
02:38:43,844 --> 02:38:44,605
[SPEAKER_10]: Queen songs are good.

2108
02:38:45,505 --> 02:38:47,425
[SPEAKER_02]: Or Scissor Sisters, I Don't Feel Like Dancing.

2109
02:38:47,525 --> 02:38:48,305
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a fun song.

2110
02:38:48,826 --> 02:38:50,466
[SPEAKER_10]: That song for some reason makes me think of the Muppets.

2111
02:38:52,679 --> 02:38:54,941
[SPEAKER_10]: Must be that one performance they did at the Brit Awards, I don't know.

2112
02:38:55,841 --> 02:38:56,122
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

2113
02:38:56,622 --> 02:38:58,063
[SPEAKER_10]: So that'll be a good one, I guess.

2114
02:38:58,123 --> 02:39:02,946
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess the music's very important to a dancing... I've never played Just Dance, but people seem to really like it.

2115
02:39:03,407 --> 02:39:11,132
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very similar, kind of, a little bit like Dance Masters, but less... It gives you a little bit of an idea of what you're supposed to do.

2116
02:39:11,673 --> 02:39:17,237
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, they have kind of... It's still kind of following on screen, but there's not that many cues to it.

2117
02:39:17,757 --> 02:39:18,057
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

2118
02:39:18,518 --> 02:39:24,543
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's a lot more than Dance Masters where Dance Masters doesn't give you any cues whatsoever.

2119
02:39:24,703 --> 02:39:26,885
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it's going to be fun to watch these two games have a showdown.

2120
02:39:27,866 --> 02:39:28,006
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2121
02:39:28,286 --> 02:39:29,427
[SPEAKER_02]: No Dance Masters this year.

2122
02:39:29,928 --> 02:39:30,228
[SPEAKER_02]: Too bad.

2123
02:39:30,568 --> 02:39:31,229
[SPEAKER_10]: What a shock.

2124
02:39:31,709 --> 02:39:31,929
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

2125
02:39:34,572 --> 02:39:34,672
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

2126
02:39:36,018 --> 02:39:38,060
[SPEAKER_02]: Connectimals is coming to Windows 7 phone this fall.

2127
02:39:39,242 --> 02:39:39,883
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of weird.

2128
02:39:41,524 --> 02:39:42,526
[SPEAKER_02]: SSX looks awesome.

2129
02:39:43,006 --> 02:39:48,252
[SPEAKER_02]: They were showing off some of the events that they can feature including 100,000 player events.

2130
02:39:49,614 --> 02:39:50,735
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's going to be really cool.

2131
02:39:51,336 --> 02:39:54,239
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, that's it.

2132
02:39:55,783 --> 02:39:56,163
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2133
02:39:56,684 --> 02:40:04,070
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that's going to start to close the book on another week here at Orange Lounge Radio, but we can't call it a show until we go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

2134
02:40:04,130 --> 02:40:05,932
[SPEAKER_10]: So, DarkSakura, your final thought for us tonight?

2135
02:40:07,013 --> 02:40:07,673
[SPEAKER_08]: I have good friends.

2136
02:40:09,775 --> 02:40:11,657
[SPEAKER_10]: My final thought is Jamie has good friends.

2137
02:40:12,898 --> 02:40:14,059
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, your final thought tonight?

2138
02:40:14,079 --> 02:40:17,422
[SPEAKER_10]: My final thought is I got to cut back on expenses a lot.

2139
02:40:19,562 --> 02:40:22,405
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you guys so much for downloading Orange Lounge Radio and tuning into us.

2142
02:40:28,393 --> 02:40:31,577
[SPEAKER_10]: We do it for free just because, you know, it's a way to kill a Sunday night.

2143
02:40:31,958 --> 02:40:33,640
[SPEAKER_10]: Just tell a friend about the show.

2144
02:40:33,740 --> 02:40:35,663
[SPEAKER_10]: Help us spread the word about Orange Lounge Radio.

2145
02:40:35,703 --> 02:40:36,364
[SPEAKER_10]: That's all we ask.

2146
02:40:37,325 --> 02:40:41,710
[SPEAKER_10]: Leave us a nice five star review on iTunes or whatever website it is that you found this podcast on.

2147
02:40:42,070 --> 02:40:44,813
[SPEAKER_10]: You would not believe how much a little word spreading can go.

2148

[SPEAKER_10]: We really appreciate it.

2149
02:40:46,756 --> 02:40:47,416
