00:00.000 --> 00:20.200
Tonight, August 14th, 2011, a patent possibly spills new details on the Wii U controller,

00:20.200 --> 00:31.560
games finally arrive on Google+, and Australia gets a new rating for graphic games.

00:31.560 --> 00:34.480
Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

00:34.480 --> 00:40.760
where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio. We are live on this lovely Sunday evening,

00:40.760 --> 00:47.060
August the 14th of 2011. My name is Rob Roberts, and with me as always, say hello to the one

00:47.060 --> 00:51.960
and the only, Dark Sakura, Jamie Sommers. Hi. How are you, Jamie Sommers? Burpy. Burpy?

00:51.960 --> 00:57.440
A little gassy? I've been drinking root beer. Having a root beer. Awesome. By the way, it's

00:57.440 --> 01:06.680
episode 424 tonight. 424, it's a palindrome episode. Quite. Like dad and mom. Exactly.

01:06.680 --> 01:14.080
And uh, other words. Alright, not a palindrome, but maybe a prime number, I'm not sure. Say

01:14.080 --> 01:20.960
hello to Techmaster Loki. Don't worry, we'll end the same way as we began. Terrible. Yes,

01:20.960 --> 01:25.040
inevitably when the show ends someday, it will end the same way it began. What are we

01:25.040 --> 01:29.880
just talking about tonight? In fact, Loki will have to do the last episode in one of

01:29.880 --> 01:34.800
those cheap little $5 microphones that like, I don't, what was that microphone we had on

01:34.800 --> 01:38.000
the first episode? It was terrible. You sounded like you were coming through a phone. I believe

01:38.000 --> 01:43.000
it was a piece of phone wire attached to a paper cup. Yeah, something like that. It was

01:43.000 --> 01:47.000
two Dixie cups and a string actually, I think is what he was using. Alright, anyhow, um,

01:47.000 --> 01:49.880
usually we start off the show with how was your gaming week, but I gotta, I gotta start

01:49.880 --> 01:54.360
this off tonight cause this is some big drama. Oh, here's a word. What? I don't wanna hear

01:54.360 --> 01:59.680
about words, I wanna tell you about my dramas. Ibophobia. What's that? Fear of palindromes?

01:59.680 --> 02:06.120
Um, no. A dog, a plan, a canoe. You are so random. Alright, oh, is the word itself a

02:06.120 --> 02:10.040
palindrome? Yeah it is. Oh, okay. I was like, what the hell are you just spouting off random

02:10.040 --> 02:16.760
words for? Are we playing balderdash tonight? Was I not aware? And so is de-leveled. De-leveled

02:16.760 --> 02:24.360
is a palindrome. All right. And uh, as our chat room, God, I love the chatters. Chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

02:24.360 --> 02:29.000
Always present fourth guest on our show. Uh, chat with us live. Uh, and Alpha Kinetogram

02:29.000 --> 02:34.600
starts us off tonight reminding us of another palindrome. He says also boob. Yes. Apparently

02:34.600 --> 02:41.560
ibophobia is an irrational fear of palindromes. Alright. Look, I gotta tell about my dramas.

02:41.560 --> 02:45.480
Okay, dramas. And I just mentioned this to you guys before the show started but you haven't

02:45.480 --> 02:49.080
really heard all the details yet. Details. Still. Here's what's going on. Okay, so you

02:49.080 --> 02:54.280
know how everybody's all up in arms like, oh my gosh, PlayStation 3, our information

02:54.280 --> 03:00.960
all got stolen, uh, Sony's in deep shit and needs to give us all years of credit protection

03:00.960 --> 03:03.920
and all this stuff, right? Yet we haven't really heard of any cases of people actually

03:03.920 --> 03:07.600
getting their information stolen on the PlayStation 3, right? Right. Okay. Well, I didn't have

03:07.600 --> 03:12.240
information on the PlayStation 3 stolen, but I had $125 charged on my Xbox live account

03:12.240 --> 03:18.040
last night. So while everything, and by the way, I'm not the first person to have that

03:18.040 --> 03:22.220
happen. It's happened to one of my friends who hasn't even really played Xbox in like

03:22.220 --> 03:27.120
a year. It's happened to another guy I know on Twitter who I know well from seeing it

03:27.120 --> 03:31.480
like E3 and you know, he's a listener of the show and so forth. And I want to say I've

03:31.480 --> 03:37.560
saw one other case on Facebook as well. So like, it's not an isolated thing. Like folks

03:37.560 --> 03:41.320
are having their Xbox live accounts hacked and I don't know where people are getting

03:41.320 --> 03:45.960
the passwords from. I use different passwords on different websites, so I don't know. I

03:45.960 --> 03:49.600
like to consider myself pretty tech savvy and I don't like to like give my password

03:49.600 --> 03:55.440
up. So I don't know where the password was compromised from, but it happened. Um, if

03:55.440 --> 03:59.160
you guys want to know how I figured it out, um, one of the games I'll talk about during

03:59.160 --> 04:03.040
my gaming week, Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet, I have been loving. So I wanted to sign on

04:03.040 --> 04:05.940
and play it today. I played it last night for a little bit and I wanted to play it today

04:05.940 --> 04:09.580
before the show so I could give you more thoughts on it. When I tried to sign into my account

04:09.580 --> 04:16.240
on Xbox live, it told me that the profile information was corrupt and needed to be re-synced

04:16.240 --> 04:21.360
or it needed to be re-downloaded from Xbox live. Basically the same pop up you get if

04:21.360 --> 04:27.400
you ever have played on somebody else's Xbox. You know, you have to download your data to

04:27.400 --> 04:32.200
be able to play on that other person's Xbox. So that told me my information had been downloaded

04:32.200 --> 04:36.960
to another Xbox, except for the fact that I had just played Shadow Planet last night

04:36.960 --> 04:41.060
and I hadn't played on any other Xboxes since then. I think I would know. The only Xbox

04:41.060 --> 04:44.400
I really used to do that with was Alan's. When I used to drive, when he lived in the

04:44.400 --> 04:48.040
Bay Area, I would go down there, transfer my info for the weekend and come home, transfer

04:48.040 --> 04:52.280
back. I hadn't done that in months. So that told me something was wrong and instantly

04:52.280 --> 04:57.280
the first thing that came to my mind was, wait a minute, I saw Justin tweet about this

04:57.280 --> 05:00.280
like two days ago. His information got hacked. I'm going to go check my bank account right

05:00.280 --> 05:03.240
now. I don't know what made me think to look. Sure enough, I look at my bank account, there's

05:03.240 --> 05:08.760
two charges on it. One for $79.99, one for $49.99, both from Xbox live. And I go into

05:08.760 --> 05:14.380
my Xbox live account and somebody had bought a gold pack, premium pack. I don't even know

05:14.380 --> 05:18.620
what game it was for because by the time I saw that I was already on the phone with Xbox.com.

05:18.620 --> 05:21.080
The good news was I was able to get right through. I didn't have to like wait on hold

05:21.080 --> 05:25.880
for a half hour or anything. Talked to a lady there was fairly helpful, but one thing that

05:25.880 --> 05:31.400
struck me as kind of odd that she told me was that, oh yeah, I got hit for $350 too.

05:31.400 --> 05:40.400
Oh, so a fifth person who works for Microsoft also got hit. And we're all mad at Sony. Why?

05:40.400 --> 05:47.840
No, I understand why we're mad at Sony, but, um, something tells me we need to be a little

05:47.840 --> 05:53.120
irritated with Microsoft right now. Either somehow information got compromised or there's

05:53.120 --> 05:58.280
something out there siphoning our information and they are currently getting all of our

05:58.280 --> 06:02.560
passwords. So my advice to you, you need to stop what you're doing right now and go change

06:02.560 --> 06:07.680
your password on xbox.com because if you haven't, you're at risk for this. So don't come crying

06:07.680 --> 06:10.440
to me when they take $125 from you because it's going to suck.

06:10.440 --> 06:15.760
It's going to suck for them because I don't have $125.

06:15.760 --> 06:20.600
And there's a lot of folks that are saying, uh, I'm going to a chat room, chat.orangeandre.com.

06:20.600 --> 06:24.960
Dick man says, I prefer buying things with cash and this is why. Tiger claw says, sky,

06:24.960 --> 06:29.840
this is why I use the xbox live cards. I never put a credit card. Uh, okay. That's nice to

06:29.840 --> 06:35.000
do in retrospect, but let's face it, I didn't do that. Microsoft doesn't exactly make it

06:35.000 --> 06:40.680
easy either to do things that way, especially once they have your credit card from an xbox

06:40.680 --> 06:45.120
live account, you know, that I had set up for gold many years ago. I've only had one

06:45.120 --> 06:49.480
card on the xbox account and it's been expired now for four years. And if you want to take

06:49.480 --> 06:53.600
it off, I think you have to call to get it removed. Like you can't even, yeah, it's ridiculous.

06:53.600 --> 06:58.160
It's a pain in the ass. They wouldn't be able to use it anyway, cause it's expired. So,

06:58.160 --> 07:02.240
and I've never renewed it. Something's coming for Microsoft. Cause I'm telling you this

07:02.240 --> 07:06.380
is happening more and more and it's not going to stop with just me and the people I've spoke

07:06.380 --> 07:11.240
about unless miraculously we've convinced the entire internet to change their passwords.

07:11.240 --> 07:15.920
Uh, it's going to keep happening and I kind of think Microsoft needs to speak up a little

07:15.920 --> 07:19.280
bit about what's going on. If nothing else, they should be putting out some bulletins

07:19.280 --> 07:23.880
about security alerts because this is just more work for them. I want to tell you this

07:23.880 --> 07:28.840
by the way as well, which is really important, is that the whole process for them to investigate

07:28.840 --> 07:35.640
is going to take 21 days. So I'm not going to see that money back for 21 days. Now, luckily

07:35.640 --> 07:41.160
I'm gainfully employed. I have a savings account. I can cover the loss of that money for 21

07:41.160 --> 07:44.760
days. It doesn't affect me, but I know we have a lot of college kids that listen to

07:44.760 --> 07:49.960
this show. They're like, I don't even have $125 for them to steal. So I'm just warning

07:49.960 --> 07:54.000
you, you know, do something about it. I have thought about calling the bank, but I thought

07:54.000 --> 08:00.400
at the end of the day, ironically enough, my card expires next month. So I was kind

08:00.400 --> 08:04.200
of thinking like, you know, why go through all that hassle when I'm going to be getting

08:04.200 --> 08:10.200
a new card anyway. And it's just kind of like if you start flagging all the Microsoft transactions

08:10.200 --> 08:13.840
as suspect, then that's probably going to give me more headache in the future. Also

08:13.840 --> 08:17.320
for all these people who say that you don't have that money in your account, keep in mind

08:17.320 --> 08:23.240
that what you put on there is a credit card attached to your bank account in most cases

08:23.240 --> 08:29.200
or an actual credit card. So if you don't have the money and they charge you, it's going

08:29.200 --> 08:32.400
to go through anyway and you're going to have to deal with overdraft charges on top of it.

08:32.400 --> 08:37.080
Right. So, you know, well, the good thing is most banks have a protection thing and

08:37.080 --> 08:40.840
you know, it's at least there's a way to have it investigated, but it's just the whole thing

08:40.840 --> 08:45.720
is frustrating. And just, you know, once again, knowing that someone has stolen my information

08:45.720 --> 08:50.920
is, is kind of crappy. It's a crappy feeling. I have no other way to explain it. And the

08:50.920 --> 08:56.520
reason why I say once again, I had my Warcraft account hacked about, probably about three

08:56.520 --> 09:00.420
years ago at this point. It was a little while ago, but it was, it was part of the reason

09:00.420 --> 09:04.080
why I took a big break from wow for a while. It happened right around the time that Old

09:04.080 --> 09:09.280
War was current content, Wrath of the Lich King. And I just logging back into my character,

09:09.280 --> 09:12.600
it didn't feel like my character anymore. Like, yeah, Blizzard had refunded all the

09:12.600 --> 09:17.000
stuff and put it all back in the mail, but it just felt, I don't know, like it just felt

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
dirty.

09:18.000 --> 09:22.000
So yeah, it kind of ruined wow for me for a little while. When I came back to wow, I

09:22.000 --> 09:26.720
rolled a new character. I haven't touched that character since that whole incident three,

09:26.720 --> 09:32.280
three some odd years ago. So learn from my mistake, I guess, although I don't think I

09:32.280 --> 09:37.000
made a mistake. I mean, with Warcraft, I'm pretty internet savvy and I don't log into

09:37.000 --> 09:42.960
a lot of suspicious stuff, but my ex was not internet savvy and I did play wow on his computer.

09:42.960 --> 09:47.040
So I think I know how I got compromised there, but this, I'm having a really hard time figuring

09:47.040 --> 09:53.480
it out. I don't know.

09:53.480 --> 09:57.840
How many other systems have you at all played on?

09:57.840 --> 10:04.520
Just Alans. Maybe one of Loki's systems years ago, but that would be it. Like, honestly

10:04.520 --> 10:05.920
it would just be Alans or

10:05.920 --> 10:10.080
it seems to me then that it's a breach with, from within Microsoft or an old Xbox of mine

10:10.080 --> 10:13.880
that I would have given to Loki, but we wiped. No, cause I had the old hard drive. It wouldn't

10:13.880 --> 10:15.840
have the information cause I have the old hard drive.

10:15.840 --> 10:21.240
I don't have any hard drives, zeros anyways, and all the systems I have, like I said, I

10:21.240 --> 10:24.800
don't have the hard drives. So, and then it seems to me that it's something from internal.

10:24.800 --> 10:29.440
Yeah. And once again, it wouldn't matter anyways, even if your profile is on there, unless I

10:29.440 --> 10:35.040
need your password, it wouldn't matter. Yeah. So, and I mean, and if in that case you could

10:35.040 --> 10:38.880
all you would really need, all you would really need to know is the email address that you

10:38.880 --> 10:46.480
used for your account and the password, basically the live.com login details, and then you recover

10:46.480 --> 10:47.840
your profile that way.

10:47.840 --> 10:54.540
So it's a bummer, but uh, yeah, that happened. So just kind of a heads up warning to folks.

10:54.540 --> 10:59.720
So you know, now I'm out that money, but luckily I have money in savings. I'm just gonna transfer

10:59.720 --> 11:04.760
over to cover it. It's not too big of a deal for me. Thankfully I have a savings, but I

11:04.760 --> 11:08.200
just don't want to see it happen to many more people because it's a shitty feeling and I

11:08.200 --> 11:11.960
kind of want to know how it happened. You know, you want to know like somebody's trying

11:11.960 --> 11:15.680
to steal money from me. Who is it? I want to kick their ass. That's what I want to know

11:15.680 --> 11:20.720
right now. So I guess we'll, we'll see what happens, but it's not just me. You guys, you

11:20.720 --> 11:22.360
guys are probably seeing it on your Facebooks too.

11:22.360 --> 11:28.760
Yeah. If you do a search on Google and you know, for a Xbox live or hacked Xbox live

11:28.760 --> 11:32.880
account and search for the past week, there's plenty of links for people saying, Hey, my

11:32.880 --> 11:38.240
account's been hacked. Wow. Uh, Bobby just sent me a private message.

11:38.240 --> 11:41.880
I'm not going to say who it was, but he knows somebody else that got hit for a hundred dollars.

11:41.880 --> 11:48.000
So good gosh, it's this, this is like, it's not isolating you guys. That's why I'm bringing

11:48.000 --> 11:51.920
it up. Like we've all been panicking about Sony, Sony, Sony, Sony, but nothing ended

11:51.920 --> 11:55.980
up happening with that data. Not to say nothing ever will. Don't sit on your laurels. Make

11:55.980 --> 11:59.360
sure everything's been changed and your passwords are up to date there too. But I'm just saying

11:59.360 --> 12:07.280
like, if you thought Microsoft was better, you're wrong. Listen up fan boys. I got $125

12:07.280 --> 12:14.320
stolen from my Xbox account today. Microsoft is no better than Sony. I'm here to tell you.

12:14.320 --> 12:18.480
So that's what I wanted to just kick off tonight's show with a lovely little warning that no

12:18.480 --> 12:23.040
company is immune from all of this data theft going on. If there's money somewhere to steal,

12:23.040 --> 12:28.440
somebody is going to try to steal it. It doesn't matter what company it is on that note. Let's

12:28.440 --> 12:32.440
talk about your gaming week and the types of video games you've been playing this week.

12:32.440 --> 12:35.480
I won't be able to play my, by the way, I can't sign into my account for 21 days. They've

12:35.480 --> 12:39.120
suspended my account during the investigation, which will take three weeks. They say I can

12:39.120 --> 12:42.960
play offline stuff and what have you, but most of the stuff I play is Xbox live arcade

12:42.960 --> 12:46.880
and I just, I don't want my achievements to get screwed up. So I basically won't be playing

12:46.880 --> 12:50.680
Xbox for the next three weeks. So if you see me on in the next three weeks, you might want

12:50.680 --> 12:55.600
to drop me an email cause it's not me. I won't be playing for the next three weeks. PlayStation

12:55.600 --> 13:00.040
three. Here I come. Woo. All right. Dark soccer. How was your game? Come over here and play

13:00.040 --> 13:06.200
super Metroid. Funny enough, I've been playing a Metroid very much like game this week, but

13:06.200 --> 13:13.000
I'll get to that in a minute. Dark soccer. How was your gaming week? Um, well, and stupid

13:13.000 --> 13:22.720
freaking tiny tower, fucking bitizens and grateful wretches. Um, and so just a few things

13:22.720 --> 13:31.240
on steam here and there, you know, nothing major. Just sort of meh. That's about it.

13:31.240 --> 13:38.880
But Rebecca black is level 70. Congratulations. Fun, fun, fun, fun. Yeah. Gang fight. Now

13:38.880 --> 13:43.200
who's now who plays nothing but wow. It's very interesting how things have changed in

13:43.200 --> 13:46.580
a year. Hey, I got to look at some of these comments that are coming in from chat room

13:46.580 --> 13:50.620
about the hacking going on. Xenocore in our chat room says, remember if Microsoft locks

13:50.620 --> 13:54.460
down your account, your games for windows stuff will also be locked down. So check your

13:54.460 --> 14:01.940
xbox live now you can't play dawn of war two offline because it requires a login. Um, thankfully

14:01.940 --> 14:08.000
I don't use games for windows. I use steam or does anyone else? I have used game room.

14:08.000 --> 14:13.520
That's about the extent of it on games. Oh no. Your game room. You won't be able to download

14:13.520 --> 14:19.520
any more game room games. Oh no. All those releases that you're missing out on. No, but

14:19.520 --> 14:23.160
I get, I mean Xenocore saying dawn of war two is, you know, tied into that and I'm sure

14:23.160 --> 14:26.600
there's other games, you know, we're here and we have a story on it tonight. All these

14:26.600 --> 14:31.360
companies want to tie you into their online service. So if you're a fan of one of these

14:31.360 --> 14:36.540
games, you kind of get screwed. So there you go. Uh, let's see. Going to other comments

14:36.540 --> 14:42.380
in chat. Uh, black Wolf clarifies he got hit while he was playing. I only must've missed

14:42.380 --> 14:46.840
it by a couple hours cause I was on last night and then I noticed it this morning. Um, let's

14:46.840 --> 14:52.240
see. Uh, sick man in our chat room says the only mistake you made sky was buying Microsoft

14:52.240 --> 14:57.920
products. It's the same mistake a lot of us have made. No, I'm sorry. That's I wanted

14:57.920 --> 15:02.400
to play shadow plan. That's actually probably the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.

15:02.400 --> 15:07.200
It's a little bit fanboy ish, but you know, obviously there's some haters out there. A

15:07.200 --> 15:12.400
Microsoft. Oh, come on. Like PlayStation people can hate on Microsoft about network security.

15:12.400 --> 15:16.960
Come on. You can't say shit. Exactly. Like so Sony fanboys can't point and laugh at what's

15:16.960 --> 15:23.520
going on here. You can't, but $125 7 million account point to telling this story was Microsoft

15:23.520 --> 15:28.880
fans can't point and laugh at Sony. You are not allowed. I'm here to tell you because

15:28.880 --> 15:33.180
money was actually stolen in this case. You are not allowed to point and laugh at what's

15:33.180 --> 15:37.880
going on with Sony and you're not allowed to tell people that they can't, you know,

15:37.880 --> 15:41.160
this, this is what you get for supporting Sony or whatever bullshit I read on Twitter

15:41.160 --> 15:46.160
during that whole stuff going on. Zebun chat says, I don't have any info on my Xbox account.

15:46.160 --> 15:50.400
I have a silver account. I don't know. I, you know, like I said, my card is up in September

15:50.400 --> 15:55.640
and uh, I'm definitely having thoughts to keeping a card online now. I think I might've

15:55.640 --> 16:01.400
learned my lesson. I decay. Well, if your card auto new renews, just be where there's,

16:01.400 --> 16:06.400
you know, a whole lawsuit, you know, we'll get into probably later on about, you know,

16:06.400 --> 16:09.760
matter how they'll still try to charge it. And then when you put a new card on there,

16:09.760 --> 16:15.560
they'll charge it twice. Oh jeez. Well, my card expires before Xbox live does, so it

16:15.560 --> 16:20.800
won't matter. Anyhow, uh, Loki, how was your gaming week? Um, pretty good actually. I played

16:20.800 --> 16:26.400
lots of stuff. I played tiny tower, of course. I played it, what I call the abridged version,

16:26.400 --> 16:31.280
which is I cheated the hell out of it and I finished the game completely. I literally

16:31.280 --> 16:36.560
have built as much of the tiny tower as I possibly can. I have all the shops, all of

16:36.560 --> 16:43.400
the different everything, all maxed out, all the achievements. I have as many, um, citizens

16:43.400 --> 16:47.120
as you can possibly fit in the building. All I can do now is build a bunch of empty floors

16:47.120 --> 16:51.280
and that's your cheater. I don't care cause you know what? That game is annoying. That

16:51.280 --> 16:55.400
game made my brain melt. It's seriously, that's the feeling I got from playing. I'm like,

16:55.400 --> 16:59.840
Oh, so I'm so glad that we done this game yet. You played it till you got every single

16:59.840 --> 17:05.040
achievement anyway, although you cheated cheer. Hey, you know what? I save time. That's why

17:05.040 --> 17:09.680
I look at it. I don't like games that make me have to go and play like, you know, go

17:09.680 --> 17:16.040
back and you know, Oh, Oh no, you know something you haven't stocked the shelves. I would think

17:16.040 --> 17:20.440
that if I'm hiring employees to work in these stores and you know, they're paying me rent

17:20.440 --> 17:24.240
and stuff, I would think that they should be smart enough to know, Hey, we're out of

17:24.240 --> 17:30.760
stuff. Maybe we should, I don't know, restock it. Why should I have the game Loki? What

17:30.760 --> 17:35.720
would the game be? You see your problem with tiny tower is that it's not tiny tower sniper.

17:35.720 --> 17:39.560
That's your problem with it. That's not my problem with it. There's been games, you know,

17:39.560 --> 17:46.520
like a theme park. I love theme park and um, you know, everybody's talking about was it

17:46.520 --> 17:51.760
mall store. I saw that, you know, and I may have to try that, but it's um, you know, just

17:51.760 --> 17:57.080
like, uh, was a game dev story. That's pretty fun. Bobby says that tiny tower has a bug

17:57.080 --> 18:00.880
right now. Yeah, it's got, if you have it open, you're only earning half the cash or

18:00.880 --> 18:05.800
something like that. Then newest version botched something. Yeah, I'm earning a lot of cash.

18:05.800 --> 18:12.240
I will actually, I can't get any cash. I already robbed the tiny bank and you took all their

18:12.240 --> 18:24.120
money. It's more like he printed his own money with his tiny printing press. Uh, so yeah,

18:24.120 --> 18:29.880
I played that. By the way, I've gotten some FUs on Google and Twitter for mentioning tiny

18:29.880 --> 18:35.560
tower on this program. FU for getting me into tiny tower. I've seen that multiple times

18:35.560 --> 18:41.320
this week. Uh, let's see, what else did I play? I tried playing juke beat on my iPod

18:41.320 --> 18:47.560
and you know, juke beat, see, the thing about it is it seems like a simple idea. You just

18:47.560 --> 18:52.600
tap the, you know, squares as they light up and stuff like that, but for some reason like

18:52.600 --> 18:56.800
the difficulty is way too high on that. I'm assuming it's because I have an iPod and it's

18:56.800 --> 19:01.600
really small, but you can, you can tweak it so that, you know, the touch area is really

19:01.600 --> 19:06.040
big. So like you can actually touch in the middle between two squares and it'll tap both

19:06.040 --> 19:12.800
of them. But like even still after doing that, I still keep failing a level two song. And

19:12.800 --> 19:18.520
I'm sorry, if it's that hard, then it's a little ridiculous. Why would I want to buy

19:18.520 --> 19:23.280
more songs? You know, which by the way, the song packs that they have are kind of terrible.

19:23.280 --> 19:27.920
So they're very terrible actually. Um, since you brought it up, I want to, cause I downloaded

19:27.920 --> 19:31.680
juke beat as well. You know, it's the new Bahmani game. It's on iOS, which is the roots

19:31.680 --> 19:36.000
of orange lawns radio is in Bahmani and I'm about to make the most ironic statement ever

19:36.000 --> 19:40.160
in the history of this show. And I mean history cause you have to go way back to why the statement

19:40.160 --> 19:45.640
is ironic. Um, I really think re rave is a better game than juke beat. I really do. It's

19:45.640 --> 19:50.280
got better music. The game itself is just better. Yes. I'm saying the game that the

19:50.280 --> 19:54.680
in the group people made is better than the game. No, no, I can't believe I'm saying it's

19:54.680 --> 20:01.280
true. I agree. It is. It is true. And the reason why it's true is because I shouldn't

20:01.280 --> 20:06.160
be failing a level two song. I mean, this is like if you're going to DDR, okay, you

20:06.160 --> 20:10.200
just suck a juke beat. Oh no, no. I must. I'm reading the comments from the internet

20:10.200 --> 20:15.120
right now. You just, I'm imagining these guys. Look, you just suck a juke beat. You just,

20:15.120 --> 20:20.920
you just, you know. Well, I understand that this game, this game may be better on an iPad.

20:20.920 --> 20:25.380
That's fine. I don't own an iPad. You need to memorize the patterns. You need to make

20:25.380 --> 20:29.600
it iPad only. Well, I understand you need to memorize the patterns. You have to do that

20:29.600 --> 20:33.880
in DDR sometimes to, you know, be able to beat some of the harder songs. But those are

20:33.880 --> 20:38.720
like, you know, eights and nines and stuff like that. You know, whereas can you imagine

20:38.720 --> 20:42.300
like butterfly or something like that and beginner, you know, the ones that they have

20:42.300 --> 20:47.640
the actual animation on screen and stuff and having to kick your ass. I mean, just the

20:47.640 --> 20:51.760
only thing about juke beat that's like irritating is that when that little thing comes up, you

20:51.760 --> 20:57.000
have like less than a second to hit it. Like you, you have no time to react. It's like,

20:57.000 --> 21:00.920
and you're playing that first song is like, like literally it's lighting up. Like there's

21:00.920 --> 21:05.640
a little passage in the Frogger song that goes do, do, do, do, do, do. So you have to

21:05.640 --> 21:09.840
be able to like hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it. Like you've got to like,

21:09.840 --> 21:13.800
it's like playing whack-a-mole at hyper speed. And there's no real indication of what's going

21:13.800 --> 21:19.600
to be next other than, you know, it just moving really fast. And I don't know, it, if maybe

21:19.600 --> 21:24.680
Ubeat is a little bit better in the arcades, I'm not really sure, but if this is exactly

21:24.680 --> 21:28.480
what it is in the arcades, I'm not too excited about it. But hey, and you know what, kind

21:28.480 --> 21:36.240
of cool, Lisa, they put something else out. But it's just kind of eh. SSJ100Matt confirms

21:36.240 --> 21:42.120
in chat, Juby, which is its name over in Japan, on the iPad is a lot better. And I could see

21:42.120 --> 21:46.240
where on the iPad, my fat finger isn't getting in the way. So I can actually like see all

21:46.240 --> 21:51.200
the things. I can like lay it on a table and probably play it easier. But on the iPhone,

21:51.200 --> 21:54.940
it's really bad. But that's fine. But then you know what they need to do then? They need

21:54.940 --> 21:59.880
to create an iPad app and then they need to create an iPhone app. Well, it's, it's you,

21:59.880 --> 22:03.980
it's universal. Oh, well that's, I know that's an easy way to get around doing that. I kind

22:03.980 --> 22:08.000
of like that it's universal. They're not going to charge me again for an iPad version. All

22:08.000 --> 22:12.160
universal is means it has both versions in one. You can still have different versions

22:12.160 --> 22:17.200
of the game. I think Tiny Towers universal too. Okay, but still, then why is it play

22:17.200 --> 22:23.360
so terrible? I mean, I, I didn't have this problem with ReRave. ReRave, it was easy enough

22:23.360 --> 22:29.240
for me to hit everything. I think ReRave just makes sense and this game doesn't. I'm sorry.

22:29.240 --> 22:35.160
It's just kind of where I'm at with it. I think ReRave was just more interesting. The

22:35.160 --> 22:39.780
targets are a lot bigger. They come up with more advanced notice. They're actually on

22:39.780 --> 22:45.000
the beat and you can tell like, oh, a red one means it's on the downbeat. A blue one

22:45.000 --> 22:50.080
means it's on the upbeat. Like it just, it makes more sense. Like, oh fuck, there's notes

22:50.080 --> 22:57.080
everywhere. Like stuff that they used to do in DDR. You know, it's like Konami, you forget

22:57.080 --> 23:01.520
that you released music games in the past and what you did to make, you know, make those

23:01.520 --> 23:05.480
accessibility. See, that's what I don't understand. This is a company that understands accessibility

23:05.480 --> 23:12.480
with their DDR games. A little too much accessibility if you ask me, but yet for some reason, a

23:12.560 --> 23:18.160
casual gaming platform as you would normally view it, they made this game so fucking difficult

23:18.160 --> 23:23.200
that most people would be just like, eh, whatever, and they're just gonna get, they'll delete

23:23.200 --> 23:28.000
it cause it's free. Yeah, I mean, at least I can say that JukeBeat's free, so check it

23:28.000 --> 23:31.200
out, download it. Maybe you'll like it even though we're sitting here, but I'll tell you

23:31.200 --> 23:34.840
what, the songs that it comes with are pretty good, but just like listening to all the little

23:34.840 --> 23:39.220
clips from the download stuff, wow, they're bad. They're all bad. I love that Contra song.

23:39.220 --> 23:42.800
That Contra song is awesome, but the rest of the songs are terrible. The Frogger song

23:42.800 --> 23:46.280
was good. I don't like Frogger. Frogger needs to die. I mean, they need to stop putting

23:46.280 --> 23:52.960
out new Frogger games. The 3DS Frogger, eh. I don't understand the point for the 3DS Frogger,

23:52.960 --> 23:59.240
but whatever. At least they're doing something slightly different with it. But, yeah, in

23:59.240 --> 24:03.480
Frogger, not really a game I know for its music. In fact, I don't believe there was

24:03.480 --> 24:08.000
any music in Frogger. Alright, I gotta read some comments from chat here. We're backing

24:08.000 --> 24:13.360
up on comments here. Going back to the hacking stuff, Sickman wanted to clarify an earlier

24:13.360 --> 24:18.520
comment and says, Sky, you completely misunderstood me. I meant they make shitty hardware. I'm

24:18.520 --> 24:22.800
not gonna disagree with you there. The hardware Xbox makes, I mean, considering the whole

24:22.800 --> 24:26.600
Red, Rings of Death and all the other crap they've had to deal with. Yeah, Microsoft

24:26.600 --> 24:32.800
does kind of make shitty hardware, but my problem wasn't a hardware issue. At all.

24:32.800 --> 24:41.800
Yeah. Other things I played this week. VVVVVVV because I got the Humble in the Bundle, and

24:41.800 --> 24:46.280
yeah, it's very difficult, and I'm kind of frustrated. I'm at this one level in the game

24:46.280 --> 24:52.280
where you have to escort this guy across the screen, and it's annoying. It's just annoying

24:52.280 --> 25:01.000
in the controls because it's very floaty, I guess. So, but hey, you get unlimited lives,

25:01.000 --> 25:04.640
it's just, sometimes it's annoying. But I think I'm almost finished with the game. I

25:04.640 --> 25:08.320
have like, I think two more people to rescue and that's it. Yeah, but there might be a

25:08.320 --> 25:11.400
whole little twist coming up or something. Yeah, I don't care. Remember how Castlevania

25:11.400 --> 25:20.200
had the upside down castle? Yeah. Be ready. And then other than that, let's see, I played

25:20.200 --> 25:24.320
more Earth Defense Force. I downloaded the two weapons packs for that. I still haven't

25:24.320 --> 25:31.200
gotten a chance to actually try the weapons, but I've downloaded them. And then also, more

25:31.200 --> 25:35.960
Grand Theft Auto, of course. And I do have in Singling Twisted Shadow Planet, but still

25:35.960 --> 25:43.720
haven't played it yet. I'm really wanting to play it because the reviews have been great,

25:43.720 --> 25:51.800
so hopefully soon. I think that's all I've played. All right. I'll talk about my gaming

25:51.800 --> 25:55.360
week, besides what I mentioned at the top of the show. Well, I have mentioned I played

25:55.360 --> 26:00.020
Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet, which I was enjoying. It's basically Metroid with kind

26:00.020 --> 26:04.560
of like Limbo's graphics, in a way. I don't know how else to explain it. I really like

26:04.560 --> 26:09.760
it. Like, I downloaded the demo and the minute I realized, I'm like, oh, this is like fucking

26:09.760 --> 26:14.120
Metroid, except it's a spaceship that you control. So it's more of a, you don't just

26:14.120 --> 26:19.760
move left and right and jump, you fly anywhere you want. Otherwise, it's that same concept

26:19.760 --> 26:25.120
where you try to find items that will break open the way to other items and so forth and

26:25.120 --> 26:29.800
exploration. And you know, I really like those types of games, the exploration games. Does

26:29.800 --> 26:36.240
it really do much to set up a story? I mean, there's movies and so on, but it doesn't exactly

26:36.240 --> 26:42.940
hand you the what to do on a silver platter. It's very abstract in some ways, but it doesn't

26:42.940 --> 26:46.080
really take away from the experience. I was really enjoying the game and I'm kind of pissed.

26:46.080 --> 26:49.400
I'm not gonna be able to play it for three more weeks because I was on a roll and I kind

26:49.400 --> 26:52.600
of wanted to beat it. Uh, but I only got about maybe a third of the way. I think it said

26:52.600 --> 26:56.980
I was like 30% complete or 33% complete. I won't be able to do that now for three weeks.

26:56.980 --> 27:03.640
So hackers, did you recover your profile to your system? No, you were unable to do that.

27:03.640 --> 27:08.680
No. Well, they, they said I could play offline, but I just, I don't know. I'm going to, because

27:08.680 --> 27:11.840
I don't want to get screwed up and all that. Yeah, it will get screwed up. I was gonna

27:11.840 --> 27:15.340
see if you recovered your profile to your system, you can play it and it wouldn't matter

27:15.340 --> 27:19.120
because they would sync back up when you're done. But if you haven't, then yeah. So those

27:19.120 --> 27:24.000
humans would go, bye bye. Yeah, no, I didn't do that. So now I'm, I'm kind of stuck. So

27:24.000 --> 27:29.500
it's all right. I've got some stuff on PlayStation three I want to play. Uh, but just irritating.

27:29.500 --> 27:33.200
And then there's always, wow. Right. Jamie, we've got a lot of ratings. You can play some

27:33.200 --> 27:38.400
LA noir. That's right. I have not touched LA noir yet and I have your copy on PSO. Yes,

27:38.400 --> 27:43.720
I'm totally missing it right now. I do need to play it. So this, the silver lining in

27:43.720 --> 27:47.440
my crap story is there are PS3 games. I actually got back my games that I've been learning

27:47.440 --> 27:50.600
out to people and like, so I completely forgot that I've been learning out. Like I got my

27:50.600 --> 27:56.460
three dot game heroes back in a portal to my other like portal to on like every goddamn

27:56.460 --> 28:01.080
system now. That's an, I need to go back and finish co-op and portal to, that's another

28:01.080 --> 28:04.760
thing I need to do. It's like I've got plenty to do. I've got, and randomly, okay, so insane

28:04.760 --> 28:09.080
twisted shadow planet. If you like Metroid, you need to be downloading the demo right

28:09.080 --> 28:14.640
now after you change your Xbox live password, go check it out because, or the Castlevania,

28:14.640 --> 28:19.480
what Metroidvania, any of those types of games, you will like this game. It's got really pretty

28:19.480 --> 28:24.480
sharp graphics. It's like playing a cartoon. It's really cool. You've got to check it out.

28:24.480 --> 28:27.440
Jamie, I think you would really like this. You really need to make it a point to check

28:27.440 --> 28:33.520
it out this week. Okay. I'll tell Dan, at least get the demo, at least get the demo.

28:33.520 --> 28:42.840
All right. Um, by the way, I forgot, so go ahead. Okay. Other games I randomly had a,

28:42.840 --> 28:47.640
I want to play civilization five and when you want to play civilization five, that turns

28:47.640 --> 28:52.040
into a five minute thought that goes on for like four hours because you can't just like

28:52.040 --> 28:56.760
stop playing civilization five. So I played an entire campaign over the weekend. You were

28:56.760 --> 29:00.600
still playing when I went to bed. I was, yeah, I was playing as the Spanish and I played

29:00.600 --> 29:04.800
from start to finish. Granted, I was playing on dopey easy level because I'm really not

29:04.800 --> 29:09.600
good at civilization, but I beat it. I did a cultural victory and I got the, no one expects

29:09.600 --> 29:15.680
the Spanish Inquisition achievement. So now I'm playing another, what better way to, I

29:15.680 --> 29:20.280
kicked it up a difficulty level and now I'm playing as, who am I playing as? The Russians.

29:20.280 --> 29:25.960
I'm playing as the Russians and I'm going to, um, uh, hopefully win a scientific victory.

29:25.960 --> 29:29.760
That's what I'm going for this time. So I, I really love Civ five. I don't know what

29:29.760 --> 29:33.320
made me decide to play it again. Just, you know, you see it sitting there in steam and

29:33.320 --> 29:36.640
I'm like, I didn't play this game in a while. I'm gonna play it. Granted, there is the new

29:36.640 --> 29:40.120
download content. I know you might be thinking, Oh, maybe you saw like the Korean download

29:40.120 --> 29:43.440
content and the new scenarios. I don't really play a lot of scenarios. I like to just play

29:43.440 --> 29:49.120
random skirmishes, but I love how customizable the game is. Civilization one is my all time

29:49.120 --> 29:54.320
favorite game next to super Metroid. Probably it's my all time favorite PC game. Uh, so

29:54.320 --> 29:58.600
it's no secret that I adore Civ five. I think it's one of the best in the series. It's certainly

29:58.600 --> 30:03.920
better than two or three. Four was pretty good too though. Uh, but I love five. So I

30:03.920 --> 30:09.560
was playing that and, um, on the PlayStation three extra for had a random gaming night

30:09.560 --> 30:15.160
last night. So a couple of us went over there and, uh, played hardcore uprising, which is

30:15.160 --> 30:19.880
the Contra game that's on X-Box three 60 and it's on PlayStation three. So we were playing

30:19.880 --> 30:24.440
that for a little bit, uh, which is, you know, it's a, it's Contra hard as hell, just like

30:24.440 --> 30:31.480
you remember. Um, and then we were playing, um, super smash brothers. Melee is the one

30:31.480 --> 30:36.000
on the Wii, right? I was getting mixed up brawls on the Wii. I can never remember which

30:36.000 --> 30:42.360
ones, which we played the Wii one for a little while. And, uh, then we played one other game

30:42.360 --> 30:45.640
that I'm totally forgetting right now. Oh, we played Katamari forever on the PlayStation

30:45.640 --> 30:49.480
three. I know random, right? But you know, I brought a stack of games over and that's

30:49.480 --> 30:54.280
what we chose to play. So that was my game night. That's pretty much my gaming week.

30:54.280 --> 30:59.280
Lots. I've been pretty busy. And then of course, wow, wow, wow. Lots of wow stuff, but I have

30:59.280 --> 31:04.600
the other show for that. Someone's going to teach me how to tank for a fee. I'm just kidding.

31:04.600 --> 31:10.560
All right. I'll pay you in pink Berry. All right. Uh, black Wolf in our chat room says,

31:10.560 --> 31:14.320
I love playing dopey on dopey, easy level and Civ five. It's so much fun. That's the

31:14.320 --> 31:18.640
way to play. That's, that's the best way to play Civ five. Uh, especially if you're not

31:18.640 --> 31:23.200
very good at the, uh, strategical types of games. All right. Uh, that's going to do it

31:23.200 --> 31:27.600
for, uh, how was our gaming week? Hope you guys had a good gaming week too. Uh, quickly

31:27.600 --> 31:32.520
some housekeeping. Um, we were still having shows over the next few weeks. You guys are

31:32.520 --> 31:36.480
going to do a show when I'm not here. Right. You said you're going to do it anyway. No,

31:36.480 --> 31:45.400
no, you're not doing, I thought you were no, I'm babysitting on a Sunday. Yes. Okay. Um,

31:45.400 --> 31:52.080
no, not a human baby. Oh, the kitty babies. That's on the 29th and 31st I think. I'm still

31:52.080 --> 31:56.920
watching the kitty babies. So no show the 28th then? Yeah. All right. Yes. A show or

31:56.920 --> 32:05.320
yes. No. No show. No show on the 28th. So you can plan accordingly. All right. Uh, visit

32:05.320 --> 32:09.400
us on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange launch radio and of course Twitter, twitter.com

32:09.400 --> 32:14.880
slash O L R. We'll be taking some of your tweets. Yes. And our tumbler now too. Orange

32:14.880 --> 32:18.960
launch radio dot tumbler dot com. All right. Look, you just beat one of the hard parts

32:18.960 --> 32:24.560
of DVD. I fucking hate that stupid mission. I hated that too. I'll just put this on pause

32:24.560 --> 32:27.520
for now. All right. Uh, yeah, you got to put it on pause cause you got to start us off

32:27.520 --> 32:31.320
with some news tonight. What's going on in the gaming world tonight? Uh, lots of stuff.

32:31.320 --> 32:35.760
So let's start talking about, uh, the steam trading beta that they're going to have, which

32:35.760 --> 32:40.840
is kind of cool in case if you're buying some packs and you get a bunch of extra games or

32:40.840 --> 32:45.880
stuff gifted to you that you may already have and whatnot. Um, basically what this is gonna

32:45.880 --> 32:54.200
allow you to do is, uh, trade different items for, I guess, didn't really say yet, but like

32:54.200 --> 33:00.280
for example, you can trade, I can know why you would do this trade like games for hacks

33:00.280 --> 33:07.320
and team fortress too. Yeah. I don't know about that. Um, yeah. Right now the service

33:07.320 --> 33:12.680
only supports trading of items, um, I guess in team fortress too, but they're going to

33:12.680 --> 33:17.680
be, um, supporting everything soon. I guess, um, portal too. So I think maybe they're talking

33:17.680 --> 33:22.000
a little bit more of just actually like in game items right now. Um, but eventually you'll

33:22.000 --> 33:27.640
be able to trade for games and whatnot. Um, I guess they're going to be allowing you to

33:27.640 --> 33:36.680
trade for games. So, uh, that's kinda cool. And actually if you think about it, I mean,

33:36.680 --> 33:41.080
I mean, that's pretty cool that they're heading in that direction anyways. Cause if you think

33:41.080 --> 33:47.760
about it, you can swap games with people. I mean, essentially, I think it's a neat idea.

33:47.760 --> 33:52.200
I mean, it's still in its early, early stages obviously. So of course it's kind of restricted

33:52.200 --> 33:58.800
to valve products. I mean, I guess it's not just valve products you can trade, but I guess

33:58.800 --> 34:02.800
the stuff that you can trade for right now is really only valve, at least with the micro

34:02.800 --> 34:08.200
transaction type of stuff. So it's still very vague to me, like how this all works. Cause

34:08.200 --> 34:11.520
I don't really have any extra copies of games straight right now. I wish I'd known this

34:11.520 --> 34:16.680
when I bought Terraria. I wouldn't have given a copy to Jamie. I would have traded it away.

34:16.680 --> 34:24.920
Hey. Okay, fine. I like Minecraft Aria. I had four copies that game and I literally

34:24.920 --> 34:30.440
gave a copy to somebody. I was like, I think he'll like it. I don't know. I don't even

34:30.440 --> 34:35.560
know if he's played it. So I could have traded that for a hat, but I don't know. And it's

34:35.560 --> 34:39.400
interesting though. I mean, how often do you just have spare copies of games lying around,

34:39.400 --> 34:44.280
but sometimes you buy these packs and you kind of get the extra copies. So I like the

34:44.280 --> 34:51.180
idea of being able to trade them for either a game I really want, or I guess a little

34:51.180 --> 34:56.080
piece of something, something in the game. Like I kind of like go, eh, I don't really

34:56.080 --> 34:59.600
need a hat in team fortress two, cause I don't really play that game. But then I go, huh,

34:59.600 --> 35:04.720
if 2k bought into this, I could buy the Korean civilization expansion for Civ five and that

35:04.720 --> 35:09.800
I would enjoy. So yeah, that's amazing how this buy sell trade stuff works and how people

35:09.800 --> 35:16.160
like it and how it promotes the sales of new items. That's amazing. Gee, I wish publishers

35:16.160 --> 35:24.200
would have thought of that. I don't think we're getting to the topic again. Of course

35:24.200 --> 35:31.440
of how they're trying to discourage buy sell trade stuff with more of the online codes

35:31.440 --> 35:36.120
and whatnot. They don't understand that they're just... I think we have a game that's doing

35:36.120 --> 35:41.800
something. It's something different than an online pass. Yeah, anyway, so, um, but they

35:41.800 --> 35:47.240
don't understand that they're only hurting themselves. I mean, by discouraging buy sell...

35:47.240 --> 35:52.920
First off, the argument, and I've said this a few times, but I'll say it again, the argument

35:52.920 --> 35:58.280
that the developers don't get money for these games if people are buying used copies is

35:58.280 --> 36:04.720
a bunch of bullshit because, for one, the developers get money when the game is sold

36:04.720 --> 36:11.920
from the publisher, not bought in the store. Perfect example, Catherine. They came out

36:11.920 --> 36:15.760
and they're all, oh yeah, we've shipped 200,000 units and they're celebrating and stuff like

36:15.760 --> 36:21.840
that. Then the NPD numbers come out for July and they've only sold 78,000 of those 200,000

36:21.840 --> 36:28.440
that were shipped. Perfect example, though. But they got paid for 200,000 copies. So say,

36:28.440 --> 36:34.560
for example, your average gamer that's gonna... they can't afford new games. And so they're

36:34.560 --> 36:39.120
buying used games, they're selling their used games, you know, trading them into like a

36:39.120 --> 36:44.480
GameStop or wherever to get credit towards a new game. That new game wouldn't be sold

36:44.480 --> 36:49.400
if you're discouraging, first off, the game companies and, you know, other people from

36:49.400 --> 36:54.880
selling used games in the first place. Then these people, they have to pony up real money

36:54.880 --> 36:59.240
in order to buy this stuff and, you know what, most of the time people are just gonna say,

36:59.240 --> 37:03.520
eh, maybe I just don't need that game. And that's really gonna hurt your bottom line

37:03.520 --> 37:09.240
in the end, because you're being greedy and trying to get a few extra sales. It's just

37:09.240 --> 37:13.280
gotta all play out. But unfortunately, people don't seem to care too much, once again, because

37:13.280 --> 37:19.120
EA's been doing it for over a year now with their sports games and I've really seen a

37:19.120 --> 37:25.160
lot of hits from their sports games, you know, oh those sales have hurt so bad. Or not at

37:25.160 --> 37:29.720
all. I think what Steam is doing is kinda smart because, you know, it's gonna encourage

37:29.720 --> 37:35.280
people to buy extra copies of games and buy the game packs just to have shit to trade.

37:35.280 --> 37:39.860
Like at the end of the day, I think this is gonna generate more money. Exactly! People

37:39.860 --> 37:45.280
are gonna wanna have the stuff in their pocket that they can barter. Like, I don't think...

37:45.280 --> 37:48.480
not everybody, but I think there's gonna be some people that are like, oh, I could buy

37:48.480 --> 37:52.760
the multi-pack for just a few dollars more and I guess I could maybe trade somebody that

37:52.760 --> 37:59.400
for DLC and get like a deal there. It's opening up this whole new flea market style thing

37:59.400 --> 38:04.760
for games that's really interesting to me. Yeah. Looking forward to that. Are you purchasing

38:04.760 --> 38:08.720
something on Steam right now? Yes. I'm being nosy, what are you buying? Oddworld Abe's

38:08.720 --> 38:20.640
Odyssey is $1.24. Oh. A whole dollar? Yeah. I like Oddworld. Oddworld's cool. Alright.

38:20.640 --> 38:27.620
So looking at our chatroom at chat.orangelaungeradio.com, Infinel in our chatroom says, buy games during

38:27.620 --> 38:33.040
the special deals at 75% off, trade later when the price goes back to normal. Possibly.

38:33.040 --> 38:39.000
Let's see. Breakman in chat says, what kind of in-game items does Portal 2 have? Nothing

38:39.000 --> 38:43.660
yet, but that's... Hats. Well, yeah, there are hats, but aren't they supposed to be getting

38:43.660 --> 38:48.280
some other stuff soon? Yeah, where the hell is that download content that we were promised

38:48.280 --> 38:58.200
back in June? IDK. Is that gonna come out before or after Half-Life 2 Episode 3? After?

38:58.200 --> 39:05.440
Damn. Do you see the people protesting outside of Valve for Half-Life 3? I know one of the

39:05.440 --> 39:09.160
guys that was doing it. It was apparently Old Gildy of mine from Valve. Okay, I'm sorry.

39:09.160 --> 39:13.440
Let me put it this way. I think they were just having fun. Okay, well good, I'm glad

39:13.440 --> 39:18.560
they're having fun because you know what? Gabe isn't starving for sales. He's definitely

39:18.560 --> 39:24.240
not starving at all. I mean, so there's no reason to think that they're in a hurry to

39:24.240 --> 39:33.240
make, you know, Half-Life 2 Episode 3. I got the sense that it was just, you know, it was

39:33.240 --> 39:40.080
something fun to do. They'll do whatever. I mean, they'll work on it. I would think

39:40.080 --> 39:45.520
at this point they gotta be... I would think that they would wanna do a new engine. I mean,

39:45.520 --> 39:51.160
how long have they been using the goddamn Half-Life 2 engine? Forever. They may have

39:51.160 --> 39:54.240
to make a new engine or something. Maybe that's what they're doing. So it's been taken ten

39:54.240 --> 40:01.000
years. IDK. Maybe. Alright, moving on. Talking about other games and so forth. PC games specifically.

40:01.000 --> 40:05.800
Battlefield 3. And you know what's interesting is one of the ways a lot of people got hooked

40:05.800 --> 40:09.320
on Steam was that if you wanted to play certain Valve games, you kinda had to install Steam

40:09.320 --> 40:12.660
and then everybody saw the deals that came with that. And then of course a bunch of other

40:12.660 --> 40:16.440
publishers got on board and we just talked earlier, there was a chat room comment about

40:16.440 --> 40:22.200
some games that require game for Windows to power them. Well, EA is soon going to be requiring

40:22.200 --> 40:27.360
Origin for Battlefield 3. That's right, if you wanna play the PC version of Battlefield

40:27.360 --> 40:32.480
3, you will have to register for EA's Origin service. This came from the DICE community

40:32.480 --> 40:37.880
manager Daniel Matros. This is all confirmed via Twitter. I guess somebody had put it out

40:37.880 --> 40:42.760
there if this was gonna be a requirement and it was confirmed. So retail, digital, doesn't

40:42.760 --> 40:47.560
matter where you buy it, you will have to sign up for Origin. Which if I'm not mistaken,

40:47.560 --> 40:53.440
EA's whole online thing kinda all shifted to Origin anyway. So it doesn't totally surprise

40:53.440 --> 40:59.640
me, but I don't know. It's just like, I really don't want 5,000 stores sitting on my computer

40:59.640 --> 41:03.040
desktop. I always thought it was stupid that you'd have to have some sort of EA account

41:03.040 --> 41:09.120
anyways for their games. Period. The fact that they're doing Origin is not a big surprise

41:09.120 --> 41:13.560
either that they want to get into the digital marketplace, but their excuse for why their

41:13.560 --> 41:18.000
game's not on Steam was just hilarious. Oh, it's because they don't want us to put our

41:18.000 --> 41:22.260
game on Steam. No, it's because you want to try to sell it exclusively on Origin. That's

41:22.260 --> 41:26.640
really the deal, but you want to make Valve out to be the bad guy. Well, hold on, because

41:26.640 --> 41:32.600
their complaint is that Valve wants to control the patching, and EA doesn't want that. EA

41:32.600 --> 41:36.780
wants to control the patching. To really make a long story short is ultimately what it boils

41:36.780 --> 41:40.300
down to, is that they don't want to have to push all their patches through Valve and get

41:40.300 --> 41:44.080
approval from Valve. They want to be able to do it themselves. That's what it boils

41:44.080 --> 41:47.600
down to. Yeah, but see, that doesn't make any sense until we know how hard the approval

41:47.600 --> 41:52.800
process is for patching. If they're like, here's the patch, okay. I mean, it's just

41:52.800 --> 41:58.960
an excuse is what it is. Going to our chatroom in the comments, Kaijuto says, I won't be

41:58.960 --> 42:03.200
playing Battlefield 3 on PC. Zether says, fuck Battlefield 3, I'll play Battlefield

42:03.200 --> 42:08.400
2 instead. Going back a little bit further, talking about Half-Life and all that, Tigerclaw

42:08.400 --> 42:12.020
says, the source engine throughout the years has been getting massive upgrades with every

42:12.020 --> 42:16.220
new game. Take Portal 2, for example. It runs on the source engine, and the graphics are

42:16.220 --> 42:21.560
better than before. That's true. Tigerclaw also points out to the folks saying, fuck

42:21.560 --> 42:26.760
Battlefield 3 on PC. A game like that was strictly made for PC in mind, then portaled

42:26.760 --> 42:34.360
to the consoles. But see, you know, this whole requirement for Origin and stuff, that's just

42:34.360 --> 42:40.800
right now. I mean, look at like, Portal 2 and stuff, or even on the other, like, Valve

42:40.800 --> 42:45.480
products. You don't have to be connected to Steam, nor to play those on your PC. No, you

42:45.480 --> 42:53.920
don't. So, I mean. Hackers will fix the problem, okay? They'll come and save the day, and that'll

42:53.920 --> 42:59.300
be the end of that. I kinda like Steam. Their actions have shown that they're really trying

42:59.300 --> 43:04.760
to be on the pulse of what gamers really want. Not what executives want for gamers, but what

43:04.760 --> 43:10.500
gamers really want. I mean, the sales have been really kick-ass. This whole trading thing,

43:10.500 --> 43:15.660
although it's a little weird, I like that they're even fucking going there. I mean,

43:15.660 --> 43:19.560
I do not expect Origin or Games for Windows to be following this, what Valve's trying

43:19.560 --> 43:24.560
to do here. And that's kinda part of the reason I'm a little loyal to Steam. They've shown,

43:24.560 --> 43:28.480
they've really tried to push, like, what they're trying to do for privacy and security, and

43:28.480 --> 43:33.720
to make sure all that stuff's locked down. Their DRM is restrictive enough without being

43:33.720 --> 43:37.620
too restrictive. I mean, I don't wanna come off sounding like a fanboy, but I feel like

43:37.620 --> 43:43.960
Steam's proven themselves where others have not. And that's basically what it boils down

43:43.960 --> 43:49.520
to, right? Yeah. It's my money. Yeah. Prove to me you want it. Yeah. You're starting to

43:49.520 --> 43:59.240
sound like what's-her-name in Portal 2, the Secretary. Burn his house down. Alright, anyhow.

43:59.240 --> 44:04.040
Let's move on, DarkSakura. Away from the PCs for a little bit, right? How about some Wii

44:04.040 --> 44:11.960
stuff? Wii, Wii! They have filed for a patent for the digital tablet. So basically there's

44:11.960 --> 44:21.400
some information about that controller going on that says it basically has a magnetometer

44:21.400 --> 44:26.600
in it, which is basically for motion control calibration. And it has the microphone, speaker,

44:26.600 --> 44:31.300
and camera functions that are also included. There's actually a neat little diagram of

44:31.300 --> 44:38.040
someone holding a Wiimote over it and using it as a, like playing golf with it. So using

44:38.040 --> 44:47.940
it to sense where the Wiimote is in terms of the floor, I guess. But they're also saying

44:47.940 --> 44:55.000
that it does have different IR modules and likely it's going to also include connectivity

44:55.000 --> 45:03.720
with the 3DS. So. And it also says it's gonna be about as strong as the PS3 and the Xbox

45:03.720 --> 45:10.160
360. I guess none of that is a huge surprise except that whole magnetometer? What do they

45:10.160 --> 45:19.100
call that? A magnetometer. It's for calibration. It's powered by Magneto. It's like your little

45:19.100 --> 45:24.440
pendulum in your pinball table. You know, you lean it too far, tilt. Well I think for

45:24.440 --> 45:29.800
one to remember it's used for finding true north. It's for orientation. Why do I need

45:29.800 --> 45:34.160
to find true north in my house? The PSP has them. What compass game would I be playing

45:34.160 --> 45:38.320
in my house? Really the PSP? Why does the PSP? Well the PSP has GPS features, right?

45:38.320 --> 45:44.160
Well the. I thought they do. It's in the move and it's going to be in the Vita. Yes it does.

45:44.160 --> 45:47.520
Don't want to do the Japanese releases. There's usually some type of like navigation software

45:47.520 --> 45:52.800
for the PSP. Yeah, they have an attachment for it. It's an extra accessory. It's going

45:52.800 --> 45:57.760
to be for the Vita, but it's already in the move. Hmm. If it had GPS I'd probably be using

45:57.760 --> 46:02.800
a lot more than there was. Fair enough. Well, I don't know. What do you think of the Wii

46:02.800 --> 46:07.580
U developments? I mean, none of it's really too shocking. I guess it's neat that they're

46:07.580 --> 46:12.200
trying to fill up the tablet with more stuff, but at the end of the day, show me the games.

46:12.200 --> 46:17.280
I think it's all just going to be integrated into their whole immersive environment type

46:17.280 --> 46:21.440
of thing. I really want to know what Nintendo's online thing's going to be. I almost think

46:21.440 --> 46:26.420
it's going to be something like a handheld Kinect. It'll have the similar functionality

46:26.420 --> 46:30.280
except it's going to use it in conjunction with the Wiimote. Hmm. Something like that.

46:30.280 --> 46:36.040
I think their online's going to be terrible. Did you say turd-arable? I thought you were

46:36.040 --> 46:39.440
going to say terraria and I was like, really? You're going to Minecraft your way on Nintendo

46:39.440 --> 46:45.600
? I was making it seem like I was going to say terrific and then mid-word I changed it

46:45.600 --> 46:52.280
to terrible. Therefore, being funny, adding humor to the word. I like turdrific. I'm going

46:52.280 --> 46:56.560
to use turdrific from now on. Well, Loki, yet another failure of your humor on this

46:56.560 --> 47:03.360
program. Hey, I considered excess myself, so failure, I do not see that. Just like the

47:03.360 --> 47:11.640
3DS, it is a very successful product. It's not failing at all. Horse turds. I like turdrific.

47:11.640 --> 47:20.720
I'll use that in a sentence three times today. Okay. Let's move on. More gaming news, Loki.

47:20.720 --> 47:29.720
Guess what? PS3's got another firmware. Hurrah. 3.7, it brings fun stuff as auto cloud saves

47:29.720 --> 47:36.080
and trophy syncing as well. However, in order to actually access any of these features,

47:36.080 --> 47:42.240
you have to be a PlayStation Plus member. Eh, that's too bad. Yeah, some of the stuff

47:42.240 --> 47:46.240
that they of course hinting at before when they were talking a little bit about PlayStation

47:46.240 --> 47:51.640
Plus. Also, they've done some rearranging of their TV and video services. I guess that

47:51.640 --> 47:58.000
will be added to the cross media bar now. And a new category will house online services

47:58.000 --> 48:03.120
like Hulu and Netflix. So they're kind of tweaking some arrangement around. Moving your

48:03.120 --> 48:08.120
stuff all around. And of course the undocumented features are they're signing stuff with new

48:08.120 --> 48:13.920
codes now. Or new keys, I guess. Trying to prevent all the hacking and cracking behind

48:13.920 --> 48:21.560
the scenes. Of course. I said trying. Yes, that is the key word, of course. Trying. I'm

48:21.560 --> 48:30.440
sure somebody found a way around it in 24 hours. Yeah, they already have. Alright. Well,

48:30.440 --> 48:37.480
I downloaded the firmware and I didn't really notice anything. Hurrah, I guess. I guess

48:37.480 --> 48:42.320
I always expect maybe my games will suddenly be more fun. Patches don't ever really seem

48:42.320 --> 48:48.240
to have that. Hey, Gamefly. You've probably heard of them. They're a pretty popular Netflixy

48:48.240 --> 48:54.880
type of service for games. But this time, they're kind of going further in that direction

48:54.880 --> 49:01.160
of Netflix where soon you'll be able to play the games on demand. It's a PC thing though.

49:01.160 --> 49:06.160
It's unlimited PC play service. You know, they took over direct to drive some time ago

49:06.160 --> 49:10.480
and this seems to be the next step of that. Gamefly says that they are talking to all

49:10.480 --> 49:14.240
publishers about participating. Several have been signed but we're not announcing at this

49:14.240 --> 49:19.660
time. In the unlimited PC play portion for Gamefly subscribers, we expect to have over

49:19.660 --> 49:23.640
a hundred titles available for the beta launch but we'll be adding to the list constantly

49:23.640 --> 49:28.840
and should have hundreds at the time of our holiday launch. So, I guess also some folks

49:28.840 --> 49:33.520
are asking, well, then if they're going to have the PC thing only, will there be a plan

49:33.520 --> 49:38.520
for Gamefly that is only PC? Kind of like how there's a Netflix streaming only plan.

49:38.520 --> 49:42.300
Sean Spector, the co-founder of Gamefly said in response to that, we currently have no

49:42.300 --> 49:47.180
plans to offer a digital only subscription as we believe the real value to gamers and

49:47.180 --> 49:51.920
our members is our unique combination of console and digital PC game offerings. So in other

49:51.920 --> 49:57.160
words, no, the plans aren't going to be any cheaper. So, I guess that's kind of cool.

49:57.160 --> 50:02.900
I mean, I don't know. It kind of sounds like what GameTap used to be. Remember GameTap?

50:02.900 --> 50:06.200
They're still around but they suck now. Like when they first came out, it was an interesting

50:06.200 --> 50:12.120
concept but, yeah, then they got sold and not so great anymore. So, I guess it's kind

50:12.120 --> 50:17.200
of neat that somebody's kind of trying to pick that up. I noticed this little demo screen

50:17.200 --> 50:21.420
shot. I don't know if this was just mocked up by somebody but it has games like DC Universe

50:21.420 --> 50:23.920
and so forth in there. Now, I can't see how it...

50:23.920 --> 50:25.520
It's because they bought Direct Drive.

50:25.520 --> 50:28.080
Oh, and that was some of the games that were on there?

50:28.080 --> 50:29.080
Yeah.

50:29.080 --> 50:33.880
Interesting. Well, it'd be kind of cool but if some of the games are playable infinitely

50:33.880 --> 50:37.960
but, I don't know, I don't have my hopes up that it'll be much more than a lot of the

50:37.960 --> 50:43.120
Flash games or really old games. You know, that's kind of what GameTap had which isn't

50:43.120 --> 50:47.240
necessarily a bad thing. I mean, just because a game is old doesn't mean it's bad. One thing

50:47.240 --> 50:51.080
I really liked about GameTap was that it had like all the old Ask Kings Quest games and

50:51.080 --> 50:55.640
all the old Zort games and all of that. Sometimes there were some gems from years and years

50:55.640 --> 51:00.320
ago that you might have missed. So, I don't know. We'll see how this plays out. It really

51:00.320 --> 51:02.960
depends on what games and how much. We'll see.

51:02.960 --> 51:03.960
DarkSakura.

51:03.960 --> 51:11.360
Well, how about some news for the UK Nintendo 3DS price cut? This is basically just the

51:11.360 --> 51:19.960
overall game revealed recently that they have a trade-in deal where if you trade in a DSi-XL

51:19.960 --> 51:28.920
you can get a 3DS for £49.99 or with Zelda Ocarina of Time for £59.99. So, that's actually

51:28.920 --> 51:37.200
a pretty decent deal. Also, the regular price of that is £159.99 bundled with Zelda Ocarina

51:37.200 --> 51:43.680
of Time. Again, this is in British Pounds. If you trade in a DSi, you will get it for

51:43.680 --> 51:54.000
£89.99. So, looking at the vendors overall, this is what you're looking for for the different

51:54.000 --> 52:02.760
prices. Not all of them are gonna price match, but here's what we have. For Tesco, it's £115.

52:02.760 --> 52:10.840
For Morrison's, £120. For ASDA, £134. For Sainsbury's, £140. Online, for Amazon it's

52:10.840 --> 52:19.480
£115. Shop2 is £135. GameStop, £135. Gameplay, £135. And Play, £140. And then High Street

52:19.480 --> 52:27.360
and Online, it says Toys R Us is £135. Currys is £140. Argos is £150. Game is £150, while

52:27.360 --> 52:34.160
Online it's £140. And HMV is £150 and includes a free game. It's £140 online.

52:34.160 --> 52:36.720
Just to kind of piggyback on that a little bit, if you want to know what's going on here

52:36.720 --> 52:42.080
in the US, Target, honestly, started a system which I thought was weird because I didn't

52:42.080 --> 52:47.680
really think of Target as buying your old systems. But apparently, Target, I guess it

52:47.680 --> 52:51.440
was just this past weekend, so you might have already missed it, so sorry about that. But

52:51.440 --> 52:57.200
I guess Target was accepting DS trade-ins as credit towards a 3DS, and Excel was worth

52:57.200 --> 53:05.120
$100, a DSI was worth $75. So I guess my Target doesn't sell used games or any that I've seen.

53:05.120 --> 53:07.320
Are there other Targets out there that are in the used game market now?

53:07.320 --> 53:10.240
I haven't seen it unless they have a deal with another used game vendor.

53:10.240 --> 53:16.200
That could be. Maybe they put them back in the, sell them back to a vendor that sells

53:16.200 --> 53:21.920
those. I don't know. Interesting. So, keep your eye out on places like Target and so

53:21.920 --> 53:27.160
forth here in the US because there will probably be other details like that soon. So, anyhow,

53:27.160 --> 53:30.680
speaking of things to do at the game store, there's some release dates we've got to go

53:30.680 --> 53:36.200
over around the world, and we'll start off with the US release dates. Loki?

53:36.200 --> 53:40.440
Not a lot this week, of course, because, you know, this month's been the theme of the past

53:40.440 --> 53:44.000
month. Yeah, pretty much. It's been slow. But at least there are some actual things

53:44.000 --> 53:48.960
coming out. Starting off with No More Heroes Paradise, or No More Heroes Heroes Paradise

53:48.960 --> 53:55.240
on the PlayStation 3. That's actually getting a budget price to it, which is kind of cool

53:55.240 --> 54:02.120
because it was full price at one point. With move support as well, so you swing around

54:02.120 --> 54:11.920
your lightsaber that way. And also, coming to Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, El Shaddai,

54:11.920 --> 54:18.720
Ascension of the Metatron from Ignition. And a pretty cool-looking action game there. Very

54:18.720 --> 54:27.240
abstract. That's on both those systems. Age of Empires Online on PC. Puzzler World 2 for

54:27.240 --> 54:37.360
Nintendo DS. Emily the Strange Strangress on the Nintendo DS. And yeah, maybe this is

54:37.360 --> 54:43.160
the problem with the Wii right here. Jerry Rice and Nidus Dog Football for the Nintendo

54:43.160 --> 54:47.720
Wii. Fuck, that sounds awesome! I love the Puppy Bowl. That's like the best part of the

54:47.720 --> 54:50.800
Super Bowl. Dog Football. The only good part of the Super Bowl. That's the only thing worth

54:50.800 --> 54:54.800
watching is the Puppy Bowl. I could give two shits about the regular football game. The

54:54.800 --> 54:59.560
Kitty Cat Halftime? Yes, Kitty Cat Halftime is what it's all about. Dog Football on the

54:59.560 --> 55:05.320
Wii. That's an amazing release on the Wii. Why are you, why you gotta be rough on the

55:05.320 --> 55:13.800
races? Don't forget to sip your waitress, everybody. Alright, reading some comments

55:13.800 --> 55:17.900
in our chatroom. Going back a little bit to the story about the Target and all the price

55:17.900 --> 55:22.320
deals on the DS and trade-ins and so forth. Mieglatov points out Best Buy is still doing

55:22.320 --> 55:27.000
that deal. I haven't seen a Best Buy that does that either, that does the used games.

55:27.000 --> 55:31.560
I guess they're doing it, but not any of the ones near here. Have you been into a Best

55:31.560 --> 55:37.040
Buy that does used games? Not lately yet. No wait, I did see one. I saw one, so I guess

55:37.040 --> 55:42.380
it is slowly coming out. So, there you go. Alright, anyhow, moving on to the Japanese

55:42.380 --> 55:48.360
releases and what's coming out of there. On the Xbox 360, Dirt 3 comes out on the 25th

55:48.360 --> 55:53.080
on the Xbox 360 and that's pretty much the only release you have to look forward to over

55:53.080 --> 56:02.000
there. On the Playstation 3 on the 18th, there is Cho-Jigan Game Neptune. I don't even know,

56:02.000 --> 56:09.160
what the heck is this? It's from Idea Factory and it is the evil witch Magicon is back and

56:09.160 --> 56:14.620
game galio world falls into chaos. The shops ran out of business, the creators are starving

56:14.620 --> 56:20.160
and most of the children are worshipping Magicon as a goddess. So what is this? This is a collaboration

56:20.160 --> 56:26.080
between Gust, Nippon Ichi, 5BP, KI Concept, Idea Factory and Compile Heart. That's a lot

56:26.080 --> 56:30.940
of, this is a huge crossover game I guess is what this is all about. Worlds collide

56:30.940 --> 56:36.640
in this game. It looks a little RPG-ish. And that's a big release I guess on the Playstation

56:36.640 --> 56:41.140
3. I don't think that's something we'll be getting over here. That's out on the 18th.

56:41.140 --> 56:49.920
Going to the other systems in Japan, nothing to say yet on the Wii, but on the PSP, Amnesia,

56:49.920 --> 56:53.920
I do not believe that is the same Amnesia that scares the shit out of people on the

56:53.920 --> 56:59.520
PC here. There's a scary ass game on the PC called Amnesia that's in Steam and stuff.

56:59.520 --> 57:07.400
It's not the same game. This is a artsy anime type of game that's available on the PSP.

57:07.400 --> 57:12.480
And there's lots of kissing. Like look, they're making out, these two are going to make out

57:12.480 --> 57:15.880
and he's probably dreaming about somebody making out with him. Like there's just lots

57:15.880 --> 57:21.920
of kissy kissy in this game. Aww. That's an adventure game on the PSP if you like kissy

57:21.920 --> 57:28.560
kissy stuff. Growlancer 4 Over Reloaded also comes out on the PSP this week. Boy there's

57:28.560 --> 57:33.200
really just not a lot to get excited about right now. They're already on the fourth one?

57:33.200 --> 57:41.020
Yes. Wow. That's it for Japanese releases. How about UK? A few. On the 17th we have Cubix

57:41.020 --> 57:49.000
HD from Dust for PC from Ubisoft. Toy Soldier Civil War and on the 19th we have Xenoblade

57:49.000 --> 57:55.320
Chronicles for Wii. That's it. There's no more. Hey, Xenoblade Chronicles might be of

57:55.320 --> 58:02.160
interest to some people. A few, maybe. Alright, I wouldn't be surprised if some of the Operation

58:02.160 --> 58:08.620
Rainfall people are like, ok, this week you have to buy a Wii system from the UK and buy

58:08.620 --> 58:17.480
Xenoblade just to show that we want it here. Just wait for it. Moving on, more news. Couple

58:17.480 --> 58:20.640
more news stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week coming up in just

58:20.640 --> 58:29.240
a little bit here. So, a little more news about THQ. We talked last week how they weren't

58:29.240 --> 58:38.400
too happy about their overall earnings for the second quarter. THQ of course is not going

58:38.400 --> 58:43.280
to actively pursue development of the MX vs ATV franchise. So, it looks like it will also

58:43.280 --> 58:51.280
be joining Red Faction as another franchise that's kind of run out of steam. They were

58:51.280 --> 58:58.240
saying their latest game was kind of an experiment, although it was a failed experiment and unfortunately

58:58.240 --> 59:03.680
releasing the title at a budget price didn't spur the extra sales they were hoping to make

59:03.680 --> 59:11.720
up on the back end with DLC and it's kind of not a good thing. So, not going to continue

59:11.720 --> 59:21.080
on with that franchise. Also, they've let go of 200 people and they're shifting their

59:21.080 --> 59:28.640
development focus away from kids and licensed titles, which I got to admit, other than the

59:28.640 --> 59:33.920
WWE games and the occasional Saints Row and stuff like that, they do a lot of fucking

59:33.920 --> 59:40.640
kids games. You probably won't see the shift away from it this holiday because they have

59:40.640 --> 59:46.160
a lot of fucking kids games coming out other than Saints Row and WWE. Lots of You Draw

59:46.160 --> 59:56.320
stuff, lots of the Marvel Superhero Squad chibi Marvel stuff and Spongebob and all the

59:56.320 --> 01:00:04.640
Nicktoons stuff. So, it's good that they're getting away from that. Oh, imagine that.

01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:11.520
All those little shovelware games didn't do so well at the end of the day. Yeah, too bad.

01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:15.360
Moving on to, I guess I was joking about this earlier, but we do have a story about the

01:00:15.360 --> 01:00:19.400
whole Xenoblade and so forth. It is coming out, of course, in Europe very soon, as Dark

01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:25.560
Sakura just said. Reggie Fils-Aime made a comment to IGN this week about Xenoblade Chronicles.

01:00:25.560 --> 01:00:29.480
We will be watching very closely what happens in Europe. Certainly, if there are business

01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:33.920
opportunities and positive consumer uptake from some of those titles, that will be great

01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:39.480
data for us to consider as we look at what to do with these titles. Boy, if that's not

01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:44.040
a run around the bush answer, if I've ever heard one, that's a I'm not fucking telling

01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:47.720
you that the game is confirmed for here. I'm just going to bullshit you with some of that.

01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:54.320
That was the biggest pound of bullshit I've ever heard. Something smells. Yeah, so whatever.

01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:59.400
It's not Shermie's ass. Whatever. So it's the nicest possible way you can say, please

01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:03.200
buy the game in Europe, but it doesn't mean we're going to put it out here. That pile

01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:12.680
of bullshit was like 400 Keurig. Anyhow, Operation Rainfall. That doesn't stop Operation Rainfall.

01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:16.160
They're not going to take no for an answer, not even for Reggie Fils-Aime, who didn't

01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:20.680
really say no, but he didn't really say yes either. Operation Rainfall is starting phase

01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:26.440
two. Kicking it up a notch. Oh no. We're stepping it up. We're going to get these fucking games

01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:33.480
out here. So would this be considered plan B? Yes, this is plan B. So here's plan B.

01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:38.420
It's going to coincide with the August 19th launch of Xenoblade Chronicles in Europe.

01:01:38.420 --> 01:01:42.640
To all residents in the regions of Europe and Oceania, says the organizers of Operation

01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:47.880
Rainfall, we encourage you to pre-order and purchase it at your earliest convenience.

01:01:47.880 --> 01:01:52.480
In the Americas, we encourage you to promote awareness of these titles. Good sales abroad

01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:56.780
will be a strong indicator for the title, making it to American shores. So, you know,

01:01:56.780 --> 01:02:00.360
tell people in Europe to go buy the fucking game and buy it now. Don't buy it used, buy

01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:03.880
it new so they get the sales, you know, try to sell a lot of copies of that game. Send

01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:08.260
us a copy. Now, yeah, that's that. Hey, we'll take that. Buy one. Oh wait, we couldn't play

01:02:08.260 --> 01:02:12.600
it on anything. Do you have a, do you have a, wait, oh, you have a region free. We don't

01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:22.600
want you. Well, sort of fair enough. Um, also they're going to be sending a rally of letters

01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:27.040
to Nintendo of America. You're supposed to mail them from August 13th to August 17th

01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:31.060
so that they all get there about the same time. This kind of reminds me of when everybody

01:02:31.060 --> 01:02:36.480
sent the peanuts to CBS to try and save Jericho. Like, but they're just sending letters like

01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:40.940
you need, like you need to send something, you need to not just send a letter, you need

01:02:40.940 --> 01:02:45.560
to send something with it. Like, you know, instead of peanuts, what's something that

01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:54.500
they could send for Xenoblade? Switchblades, switchblades, box cutters. No, don't do that.

01:02:54.500 --> 01:03:00.040
Don't do it now. We're just kidding. Don't do that. Good Lord. Like the shit. They will

01:03:00.040 --> 01:03:05.060
look at you at the post office. Funny if you do that. Send them hand drawn pictures of

01:03:05.060 --> 01:03:11.120
knives. No, don't do that. Don't do that. Um, let's see. What could, what could you

01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:15.000
send? I have to turn that over to the chat room. That would remind somebody of Xenoblade

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:20.000
or I guess you could say the last story or Pandora's tower. Is there like some other

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:26.840
factor that makes a whole bunch of copies of Xenogears from PlayStation the best? I

01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:33.220
don't know. Um, what about like letter Xs? Like they should cut out the letter X from

01:03:33.220 --> 01:03:37.240
all their magazines and put them in an envelope so that when they open it up, just Xs fly

01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:49.200
everywhere. And the X means Xenoblade. How about bees? No, cause the bees would fly everywhere.

01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:53.560
It's a little more daring. All right, fine. I don't want to open the rest of those letters.

01:03:53.560 --> 01:04:00.800
They're all buzzing over there. I just thought it was the one, but I'm pretty sure there's

01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:13.040
bees in all of those. This package is buzzing and it's angry. Make it stop Reggie. Fine.

01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:16.760
Send them bees. All right. I'm pretty sure bees wouldn't survive the trip though, but

01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:23.880
uh, you could try the holes in the box. Oh, we're sending in a box. You can fill out bees

01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:31.560
in a box. Don't send them bees. Just send them a jar of honey saying we were going to

01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:36.200
send bees, but bees didn't want to stay in the box. Here's some honey instead. You know,

01:04:36.200 --> 01:04:42.260
wasps, they're meaner. Hold on. No. Operation rainfall does not think you should send bees.

01:04:42.260 --> 01:04:47.240
They say you should send letters and they've also posted an open letter to Satoru Wata.

01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:50.760
Here's what you need to do. If you want to just beat the shit out of a water right now,

01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:55.920
buy Nintendo stock and then complain as an investor. That's what you need to do. If you

01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:59.800
really want to kick Nintendo in the balls right now, become an investor of Nintendo

01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:05.040
stock and then say, as an investor, I feel that you need to bring Xenoblade out of here.

01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:11.360
The stock prices keep dropping, so it's going to be cheap real soon. Okay, now the chat

01:05:11.360 --> 01:05:16.880
room has a great suggestion. Send them porn because when you think X, it's X, X, X. Yeah,

01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:26.280
that's not going to work. Send them porn. Send them. What is it? Frisbee in chat says

01:05:26.280 --> 01:05:33.400
each one of these things is how you make us feel. Sorry. Cause you know, I'm thinking

01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:37.840
of that gift that's out there on the internet. The animated gift file of Oprah opening the

01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:44.480
box. It says bees. It was on the Conan show. Tiger cloth. Find me that GIF posted in chats.

01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:48.640
Even better issues. You send it like the Riddler. You know how the Riddler would send you a

01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:53.240
little boxes, question marks on, but they have a box with a question mark on it in the

01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:58.280
Mario universe. It fits like that with the bees. That's good. Or you can have the treasure

01:05:58.280 --> 01:06:09.000
chest from Zelda. So when they open it, it's like, doo, doo, doo, doo, bees. And then the

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:14.040
note says each of these things is how you make us feel or bees in a jar. Just like,

01:06:14.040 --> 01:06:20.840
you know, Zelda, it's all, I'm really going with the bees here. I think the bees are really

01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:25.240
good. They keep sending bees, throw them in the fountain and see if you get super bees,

01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:30.520
super bees. All right, look, there's more to this story. Shut up about the bees already.

01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:36.520
All right. On August 19th, there's one more big thing that operation rainfall is going

01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:42.720
to be doing. You're ready as a show of an interest in RPGs. Everybody on August 19th

01:06:42.720 --> 01:06:50.240
should purchase Final Fantasy on Virtual Console. But if you already have it, you should give

01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:55.960
the money to somebody else or donate to Child's Play, which I'm not going to make fun of that

01:06:55.960 --> 01:07:00.840
idea. I think donating to Child's Play is always a good idea. I'm not quite sure how

01:07:00.840 --> 01:07:06.120
that gets the point across that you want Xenoblade, but okay, whatever gets you to donate to a

01:07:06.120 --> 01:07:11.480
good charity. That's fine. As far as buying Final Fantasy on the Virtual Console, I think

01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:16.160
your money might just be better spent giving the money to Child's Play in the name of bringing

01:07:16.160 --> 01:07:24.160
Xenoblade to the Wii. Like, how is buying Final Fantasy on Virtual Console and increasing

01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:32.480
Square Enix's coffers going to prove to Reggie that we want Xenoblade? I don't, like, Loki,

01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:35.480
can you help explain this to me? Because I'm not understanding.

01:07:35.480 --> 01:07:51.080
Well, they have blades in both of them, and Square Enix made Xenogears, and it's a terrible

01:07:51.080 --> 01:07:58.040
idea. Because you know what's going to happen? Because once again, this is the problem. Yes,

01:07:58.040 --> 01:08:04.480
there's lots of people on forums, lots of people on forums, that are complaining that

01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:12.240
Xenoblade is not coming to the United States. But lots of people on forums also said, Mad

01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:16.840
World is a fucking awesome game and I'm going to buy it. See, that's the problem. People

01:08:16.840 --> 01:08:24.240
on forums, you know what your numbers are, right? You're not 100,000. You're not maybe

01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:25.240
even 10,000.

01:08:25.240 --> 01:08:28.920
And most people that post on forums that say they're going to buy it don't really buy it.

01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:31.160
They end up pirating it, or borrowing it from a friend.

01:08:31.160 --> 01:08:37.080
There are maybe a few thousand people that want this game. And I'm sorry, a game that

01:08:37.080 --> 01:08:44.480
only sells a few thousand copies is a failure. So, it's just not going to happen. You know

01:08:44.480 --> 01:08:50.680
what? Just save your money, save your time, wait for E3 next year, and maybe they'll announce

01:08:50.680 --> 01:08:54.120
it. But in the meantime, if you really do want to spend, like, I don't know how much

01:08:54.120 --> 01:09:00.200
it is for Final Fantasy 7 bucks, you can buy a lot of bees for $7. I'm telling you. I think

01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:03.520
it's a great idea. And you know what? Hey, okay, fine. If you don't want to send them

01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:07.680
live bees, because that might be a terrorist attack or a terror threat or something like

01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:10.200
that, you know how they're all insensitive about that kind of...

01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:11.740
But bees pollinate!

01:09:11.740 --> 01:09:15.680
You can send them, like, a chocolate-covered... They don't sell chocolate-covered bees, I

01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:16.680
would imagine.

01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:17.680
I know. I know.

01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:19.960
Maybe, like, uh...

01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:20.960
Pictures of bees?

01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:28.240
You know, send them Mario with his head cut off. I don't know. Just... Here's what you

01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:33.880
need to do. Spend that $10 or whatever that you would have spent on, you know, Final Fantasy

01:09:33.880 --> 01:09:35.760
or whatever. Just...

01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:38.480
And donate it to charity and know that your money went to something good.

01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:43.480
Or go buy lunch. Or go, like, go just, you know, rent a porno or something like that.

01:09:43.480 --> 01:09:48.760
Fucking chill the fuck out. Because you're, like, getting all up in arms about, like,

01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:54.480
some one damn game. Oh, these are the best games on the Wii! The best RPGs! The Wii is

01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:59.600
over, okay? The Wii is done. It's pretty much done. It's... You're just, like, trying to

01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:03.640
get this last good game out before the Wii is done. It's done, okay? They're going on

01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:09.200
to the Wii U. So just get over it. Better games are out there. Better games will be

01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:13.760
coming out there. So they didn't bring a hardcore game to the Wii, even though they said, oh,

01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:15.560
we're catering to everybody.

01:10:15.560 --> 01:10:20.640
Just get over it. They don't care about you. They don't care what you want. Otherwise,

01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:24.080
you know what Earthbound would be out? You know, Earthbound 3 or Mother 3 or whatever

01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:28.400
the fuck that is. That would be out here in some form. They don't give a shit because

01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:34.080
they know, in the end, that a few thousand people arguing on forums about this is just

01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:38.520
a few thousand people and not a hundred thousand or multiple hundreds of thousands of people

01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:39.960
that are going to buy this game.

01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:47.080
Dark Tetsuya points out, you know, Mario did have a bee power-up in Mario Galaxy.

01:10:47.080 --> 01:10:50.480
So you see, right there, Nintendo loves bees. And I think that...

01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:55.080
All right. I'm going to end this conversation on a comment that's about as good as this

01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:56.080
whole effort.

01:10:56.080 --> 01:10:57.080
Wait, wait, wait.

01:10:57.080 --> 01:10:58.080
What?

01:10:58.080 --> 01:11:02.160
If you don't like bees because they fly around, you know, and that might be a little...

01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:03.160
It might be hard to catch.

01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:05.920
It may be hard to catch. Scorpions also work.

01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:08.960
Stop it. All right. I'm going to end on this comment from our chat room.

01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:12.440
You can get candy-covered scorpions. Those are safe.

01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:18.880
Spazinator says, Nintendo would boil the bees to make a bee tea. I heard bee tea makes for

01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:20.840
a good buzz.

01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:28.000
Just going to let that joke settle for a minute.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:33.440
Let's go to the classic game of the week.

01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:37.240
Every week here on Orange Lounge, Rito Dark Sakura dives into the gaming vault and finds

01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:38.240
the bee.

01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:41.840
Whoa, whoa, hold on. Before we start, Break Man says, so Loki thinks trying to hurt the

01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:45.220
developers is a better idea than trying to bribe them.

01:11:45.220 --> 01:11:48.280
We're not saying it to the developers. We're saying it to Nintendo. They're not the developers.

01:11:48.280 --> 01:11:49.280
We're not trying to hurt them.

01:11:49.280 --> 01:11:52.360
The developers are far away, safe from the bees.

01:11:52.360 --> 01:11:55.440
All right, sorry.

01:11:55.440 --> 01:12:00.560
By the way, I believe Dark Sakura posted that gif on Tumblr for those that are listening

01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:02.040
on the podcast.

01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:03.040
I did.

01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:07.240
I like having the Tumblr, so when funny shit comes up on the show, we can talk about it

01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:08.240
on Tumblr.

01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:09.240
Yes.

01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:12.280
Oh, remove that thing that cross posts everything to Twitter, though.

01:12:12.280 --> 01:12:14.040
I don't think I ever set that up.

01:12:14.040 --> 01:12:17.760
It's doing it. See if you can find it. All right.

01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:18.760
Classic game of the week.

01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:19.760
Yay.

01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:24.120
Dark Sakura goes in the classic gaming vault, finds the game. She thinks, hey, you kids

01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:26.000
ought to be playing it this week.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:31.000
Forget the last story. This is the only story you fucking need.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.360
Dark Sakura, what is the classic game of the week this week?

01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:36.320
Warcraft III, Reign of Chaos.

01:12:36.320 --> 01:12:37.320
Addict.

01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:43.360
No, not really, because I don't like real-time strategy games, but I'm trying to play it.

01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:48.600
I'm trying to, so I thought I would bring it up.

01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:51.160
This is, of course, the third in a row.

01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:56.160
The first one was Warcraft Orcs and Humans, and the second one was Tides of Darkness,

01:12:56.160 --> 01:12:59.160
and this one's Reign of Chaos.

01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:00.160
Oops, sorry.

01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:06.160
The music one that I put up there is actually from the expansion, The Frozen Throne.

01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:07.160
Okay.

01:13:07.160 --> 01:13:14.960
So, yeah, it did come out, and it actually was released on July 3rd, 2002, and it's the

01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:20.560
second sequel to, as I said, Warcraft Orcs and Humans.

01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:25.360
It had an expansion pack called The Frozen Throne that came out on July 1st, 2003.

01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:27.560
So you have four playable races this time.

01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:34.800
You have Orcs and Humans, and you also have Night Elves and Undead, and it's sort of laid

01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:38.300
out like Starcraft.

01:13:38.300 --> 01:13:42.080
You also have other races in the expansion.

01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:50.560
You get the Draenei and the Naga, who are really elves, but they suck.

01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:56.440
Anyway, you've got multiplayer, you can play on the internet, you can do, you can play

01:13:56.440 --> 01:14:03.960
against the computer, you can even later on mod your levels and do customized level layouts

01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:05.400
and map changes and everything.

01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:07.200
It's pretty cool.

01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:14.120
And the proper story lines, basically, is if you've done the Orc campaign on Warcraft

01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:19.000
and the Human campaigns on Warcraft, actually both Warcraft II, so that would be Tides of

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:24.200
Darkness and Beyond the Dark Portal, then those lead into Warcraft III.

01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:32.160
So it sold 4.5 million units, a little ship, I should say, and it sold over a million within

01:14:32.160 --> 01:14:37.040
a month, and it is one of the game beer ones listed.

01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:41.800
So basically, it's a, you know, like I said, real-time strategy.

01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:46.440
You have this stuff called the Black Mask that covers places that you haven't explored,

01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:50.040
but when you explore, it goes away, but if you move too far away, then you get the Fog

01:14:50.040 --> 01:14:56.720
of War, which makes, um, you can't see what troops are doing and what building construction

01:14:56.720 --> 01:14:59.960
is going on, though you can still see the terrain.

01:14:59.960 --> 01:15:05.920
I call that saving space for, you know, rendering, but that's another story.

01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:08.280
Um, so you have to get your different resources.

01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:16.080
You need gold, lumber, and food, and you have to have those to make buildings, and the food

01:15:16.080 --> 01:15:19.960
determines the number of units you can control at any given time, so basically the more troops

01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:22.560
you can feed, the more you can have out in play.

01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:27.080
You also have creeps, which are controlled by the computer, and they guard different

01:15:27.080 --> 01:15:32.840
areas like gold mines and buildings, um, you can kill them for gold, experience, and special

01:15:32.840 --> 01:15:39.720
items, and you have a day-night cycle that was also introduced for this game.

01:15:39.720 --> 01:15:46.320
Um, at the night, the creeps fall asleep, so nighttime scouting at night is safer, but

01:15:46.320 --> 01:15:50.120
you also have reduced line of sight, that type of thing, so it's got different things

01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:51.120
going on.

01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:58.480
And according now that it has 3D terrain, um, you've got other line of sight, uh, limitations

01:15:58.480 --> 01:16:00.400
as well.

01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:04.720
So with this one, you also get something called heroes.

01:16:04.720 --> 01:16:09.960
So when you have an enemy unit killed, your hero will gain experience points and can level

01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:17.320
up as far as 10, and they also get new spells, kind of gets like an RPG element to it, and

01:16:17.320 --> 01:16:22.160
they can, uh, boost their units that way, and they'll get ULTIMATE SKILLS!

01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:25.960
So basically, you've got your different campaign modes, you've got five campaigns, including

01:16:25.960 --> 01:16:31.520
the prologue, that introduces the different, uh, race, um, races.

01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:36.120
There's two orc campaigns, one human, one undead, and one night elf, and they have different

01:16:36.120 --> 01:16:41.640
chapters which are kind of like your missions, and, uh, but you do not have briefings as

01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:43.600
you did in the earlier games.

01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:50.200
It just sort of comes out in a series of quests, and, uh, the story unfolds through cinematics

01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:55.880
and cutscenes, and you get your different objectives as you progress through the game.

01:16:55.880 --> 01:16:58.840
Kind of like how World of Warcraft is doing now.

01:16:58.840 --> 01:17:04.880
You know, it seems to me it's exactly, you know, a good transition.

01:17:04.880 --> 01:17:14.520
So anyway, um, it's, you have different patterns, like you have a building mission, and then

01:17:14.520 --> 01:17:18.600
you have to maintain your base, and then fight the enemy.

01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:22.840
The night elf ones are a little bit different, um, because they have just a limited base,

01:17:22.840 --> 01:17:27.720
but then they have epic battles, ooh, and of course there's multiplayer, you know, so

01:17:27.720 --> 01:17:31.360
you can go against your friends and other people on battle net.

01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:37.540
You had different, uh, gateways, um, you had your Azeroth, which was east, um, the eastern

01:17:37.540 --> 01:17:38.540
US.

01:17:38.540 --> 01:17:44.760
Leuridron, which was the, um, the west United States, northward for Europe, and Kalimdor

01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:46.240
for Asia.

01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:52.560
So you could, uh, actually play anonymously with other people.

01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:58.800
It's called matchmaking, ooh, so you could have different battles against random people.

01:17:58.800 --> 01:18:04.720
And then, um, there were also, uh, scores and standings that were marked on the ladder.

01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:08.800
So as far as the game goes, I'm not gonna tell too much of the story, um, I prefer to

01:18:08.800 --> 01:18:11.080
paraphrase it as Arthas is a bitch.

01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:12.960
Don't you think?

01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:15.960
Yeah, about sums it up.

01:18:15.960 --> 01:18:22.440
Arthas decides he's gonna get all big and bad, and, uh, burn a bunch of people to death,

01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:27.320
and then get some sword and give his soul up for his sword, and then become, uh, the

01:18:27.320 --> 01:18:28.320
Lich King's bitch.

01:18:28.320 --> 01:18:35.240
And, uh, and then he does a whole bunch of awful shit, like, you know, killing his dad,

01:18:35.240 --> 01:18:40.560
and killing a bunch of other people, and turning Sylvanas into, you know, a banshee, and all

01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:42.240
kinds of other crap.

01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:47.800
So yeah, it's, it's basically Arthas is a bitch, the game.

01:18:47.800 --> 01:18:53.960
Um, but you also find a few, or a few people that went to MIA in earlier games, what happened

01:18:53.960 --> 01:18:54.960
to them.

01:18:54.960 --> 01:18:59.720
And, of course, for anyone who's playing World of Warcraft now, uh, you know, pretty much

01:18:59.720 --> 01:19:06.040
all these characters that were in this game play into, um, you, you can find them in World

01:19:06.040 --> 01:19:11.360
of Warcraft, or they've been dead and are affecting the game, but it's all built on

01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:13.400
what went on in this game.

01:19:13.400 --> 01:19:18.800
Um, it has great sound, you could actually, if you got the limited edition, it came with

01:19:18.800 --> 01:19:19.800
the soundtrack.

01:19:19.800 --> 01:19:25.200
Uh, there were different types of, uh, you know, music for the different, uh, races,

01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:31.400
like the one that I just, we were just hearing was the night elf theme, which is pretty good

01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:32.400
music.

01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:33.400
Um...

01:19:33.400 --> 01:19:36.520
It's at the end though, so I'm gonna switch to the undead music.

01:19:36.520 --> 01:19:37.520
Okay.

01:19:37.520 --> 01:19:44.600
So, uh, and like I said, you could also, um, there was a world editor that you could change

01:19:44.600 --> 01:19:46.400
different events and change different things.

01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:51.920
You could download each other's maps, and, uh, there were also third party developing,

01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:55.540
uh, developers that had different tools that came out, like different spreadsheets and

01:19:55.540 --> 01:19:59.360
customizing skins, all kinds of different cool stuff.

01:19:59.360 --> 01:20:07.000
So, uh, basically the game, um, there was this, like, epic bundle that came with, uh,

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:13.680
the soundtrack and structure manual, the art of warcraft book and lithographic prints,

01:20:13.680 --> 01:20:19.120
and, um, you could also get the battle chest, which had reign of chaos with the frozen throne

01:20:19.120 --> 01:20:22.080
inbox, and the guides from brady games.

01:20:22.080 --> 01:20:27.360
There's also an exclusive gift set that had a cinematic DVD, and a bunch of other crap.

01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:33.880
And, uh, there was also, uh, for anyone who played warcraft the board game, it actually

01:20:33.880 --> 01:20:37.680
was based heavily off of warcraft 3.

01:20:37.680 --> 01:20:47.160
It got a 93.09% at game rank rankings dot com, and basically it's just considered one

01:20:47.160 --> 01:20:52.800
of the greatest game, I'd say modern games of all time, so, there you go.

01:20:52.800 --> 01:20:58.120
Alright, there it is folks, your classic game of the week, warcraft 3.

01:20:58.120 --> 01:20:59.720
Arthas is a bitch.

01:20:59.720 --> 01:21:03.160
Arthas is a bitch, and as salaciouspop says in chat, Arthas is a bitch, and Illidan needs

01:21:03.160 --> 01:21:05.280
to stop listening to Linkin Park.

01:21:05.280 --> 01:21:06.280
Yes!

01:21:06.280 --> 01:21:10.720
There you go, alright that's gonna do it for part A here of Orange Lounge Radio, but don't

01:21:10.720 --> 01:21:14.440
go anywhere guys, we've got plenty more to come of the show tonight, we're gonna move

01:21:14.440 --> 01:21:18.760
into part B, talk a little bit about Google+, more Nintendo news, and of course mailbag,

01:21:18.760 --> 01:21:29.440
FUs, tweets, and calls, all when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:21:29.440 --> 01:21:34.320
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, we are live of course on this Sunday evening,

01:21:34.320 --> 01:21:41.000
August the 14th of 2011, with the 424th episode of our show, taping live at All Games Radio,

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:46.600
www.allgames.com, you missed a fun part A that was full of Bs, but we are gonna continue

01:21:46.600 --> 01:21:51.280
on with part B of our show right now, and we're gonna start off with some rapid fire

01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:52.280
news.

01:21:52.280 --> 01:21:53.280
Loki.

01:21:53.280 --> 01:21:54.280
This game is hard.

01:21:54.280 --> 01:21:55.280
Anyways.

01:21:55.280 --> 01:21:56.280
What game?

01:21:56.280 --> 01:21:57.520
Oh you're still playing VVVVVV over there right?

01:21:57.520 --> 01:22:00.600
Yes, I had to dodge the lies.

01:22:00.600 --> 01:22:07.460
So this is interesting, Kojima of course during his podcast, they had done a Snatcher Universe

01:22:07.460 --> 01:22:16.220
radio drama, which was I guess entitled Suda 51's Sedature, and it's now being offered

01:22:16.220 --> 01:22:20.880
as a free download, and if you want something a little bit more physical, you can get a

01:22:20.880 --> 01:22:26.760
CD that will be sold later on, I guess to pay the voice actors, and I guess the voice

01:22:26.760 --> 01:22:30.960
drama also featured a lot of the people that did voices in Metal Gear, so that's kinda

01:22:30.960 --> 01:22:33.240
cool.

01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:39.280
And so yeah, check that out, and if you're looking for more information on that, I believe

01:22:39.280 --> 01:22:49.520
you can just check out his actual podcast, it's www.KJP.Konami.JP, and I think it's the

01:22:49.520 --> 01:22:52.880
Hideo blog on there.

01:22:52.880 --> 01:23:00.520
Motorstorm Apocalypse is getting a brand new update, and they're adding mode support, which

01:23:00.520 --> 01:23:06.920
I guess allows you to customize the vehicles, and some of the other options that are in

01:23:06.920 --> 01:23:09.160
the game.

01:23:09.160 --> 01:23:16.120
You can tweak everything including, that's awesome, you can disable brakes, you can disable

01:23:16.120 --> 01:23:17.120
gravity.

01:23:17.120 --> 01:23:20.440
Sweet, a racing game with no brakes.

01:23:20.440 --> 01:23:24.840
It sounds kinda cool, so I'd have to check that out.

01:23:24.840 --> 01:23:30.800
They also added PlayStation Move support for I guess if you wanted to do the ol' Wii steering

01:23:30.800 --> 01:23:38.100
type thing on there, I don't know if I'd recommend that, but you know, the options there at least.

01:23:38.100 --> 01:23:43.880
So that's out there now, so just connect to the internet and pop in the game.

01:23:43.880 --> 01:23:47.360
And then Child of Eden unfortunately has been delayed a week, but I think it's kinda cool

01:23:47.360 --> 01:23:52.280
because they're getting 3D support now, so you'll be able to check out the game September

01:23:52.280 --> 01:23:53.280
27th.

01:23:53.280 --> 01:23:54.960
It's PlayStation 3 though, right?

01:23:54.960 --> 01:23:57.040
The PlayStation 3 version, yes, 360.

01:23:57.040 --> 01:24:01.440
And of course it will feature Move controls as well, which to be honest I think that's

01:24:01.440 --> 01:24:05.760
gonna be way better than what the Kinect was, so I would be kinda curious to check it out

01:24:05.760 --> 01:24:11.680
on the PS3, but 3D man, I can only imagine that game, it's gonna be just amazing.

01:24:11.680 --> 01:24:18.480
Yeah it's gonna be kind of a trip in 3D, so do I know anyone with a 3D TV and a PlayStation

01:24:18.480 --> 01:24:19.480
3?

01:24:19.480 --> 01:24:21.120
I can't think of anyone off the top of my head.

01:24:21.120 --> 01:24:23.960
3D televisions haven't exactly cracked into the mainstream.

01:24:23.960 --> 01:24:27.480
We have one in my work that's actually a Sony TV.

01:24:27.480 --> 01:24:31.560
I've really contemplated getting one of those monitors though, I'm not gonna lie.

01:24:31.560 --> 01:24:33.600
They're pretty decent, I mean it's about that big.

01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:38.760
Yeah it's, you know, for gaming like in a little office or bedroom or something it would

01:24:38.760 --> 01:24:43.880
be pretty good, good enough, so I gotta say I'm curious.

01:24:43.880 --> 01:24:48.560
Alright, one of the games I might check out on the PlayStation 3 is the Metal Gear Solid

01:24:48.560 --> 01:24:49.880
HD collection.

01:24:49.880 --> 01:24:55.200
Hideo Kojima talked about on Twitter this week some of the differences between the region

01:24:55.200 --> 01:25:00.040
releases, I'm not sure why, but the Japanese version of the game will not include Metal

01:25:00.040 --> 01:25:02.200
Gear Solid Peace Walker.

01:25:02.200 --> 01:25:06.360
It will have a download code however for the first Metal Gear Solid, I don't believe it's

01:25:06.360 --> 01:25:09.960
uprezzed or anything like that though, it's just pretty much the original PlayStation

01:25:09.960 --> 01:25:10.960
game.

01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:14.400
Now the overseas version, which would include the one that's gonna come out in America,

01:25:14.400 --> 01:25:18.660
it will not have the download for the first Metal Gear Solid, but it will have the HD

01:25:18.660 --> 01:25:19.840
version of Peace Walker.

01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:23.440
So I don't know why the difference is, but there you go.

01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:28.760
Also of note, Metal Gear Solid 3 HD is going to be the subsistence version of the game.

01:25:28.760 --> 01:25:32.000
It has the user control camera and all that stuff.

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:37.680
It also has emulated MSX versions of Metal Gear 1 and 2.

01:25:37.680 --> 01:25:41.160
That's pretty awesome, because that was all, the subsistence versions of Metal Gear Solid

01:25:41.160 --> 01:25:43.640
3 had that, so that's pretty rad.

01:25:43.640 --> 01:25:48.000
I don't know if that means that we'll see them here in America, because those games

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:52.440
were never translated to English, because the MSX was never out in America, so I don't

01:25:52.440 --> 01:25:53.440
know how that's all gonna work.

01:25:53.440 --> 01:25:54.440
It's gonna be very interesting.

01:25:54.440 --> 01:25:59.320
I really hope we can play those games in their original MSX format.

01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:02.440
Keep in mind, oh by the way, there's a huge difference between Metal Gear 2 and Snake's

01:26:02.440 --> 01:26:04.440
Revenge, by the way, if you didn't know that.

01:26:04.440 --> 01:26:09.840
Snake's Revenge was completely done in America, and Kojima was not involved with that at all.

01:26:09.840 --> 01:26:15.900
But there was an official Metal Gear 2, I'm not talking Solid, Metal Gear 2 on the MSX,

01:26:15.900 --> 01:26:17.200
oh so many years ago.

01:26:17.200 --> 01:26:18.200
We never saw it here.

01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:19.200
There are fan translations.

01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:24.020
Maybe, well I don't think they'd use a fan translation, but I would, man, I really hope

01:26:24.020 --> 01:26:25.960
the MSX versions show up, but we'll see.

01:26:25.960 --> 01:26:32.840
Anyhow, Metal Gear Solid 2 HD release would also be based on Subsistence, I guess he really

01:26:32.840 --> 01:26:36.200
meant to say the substance version of the game, because there wasn't a Subsistence,

01:26:36.200 --> 01:26:37.200
but whatever.

01:26:37.200 --> 01:26:38.200
I don't know-

01:26:38.200 --> 01:26:39.200
No, what's Subsistence?

01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:40.200
Subsistence.

01:26:40.200 --> 01:26:41.200
Was it?

01:26:41.200 --> 01:26:42.200
Yeah.

01:26:42.200 --> 01:26:43.200
Well, whatever.

01:26:43.200 --> 01:26:47.920
Anyhow, those games will be in HD, and we'll have all the trophy support and all that good

01:26:47.920 --> 01:26:48.920
stuff.

01:26:48.920 --> 01:26:52.400
A game that you might have forgot about, but it's still coming, you know, eventually, Sonic

01:26:52.400 --> 01:26:54.000
4, Episode 2.

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:57.640
Remember, because there was Sonic 4, Episode 1, and it kind of came out, and the whole

01:26:57.640 --> 01:26:59.520
internet was all, no one cur.

01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:04.160
A lot of people thought that Sonic 4 was pretty much dead, now that Sonic Generations is kind

01:27:04.160 --> 01:27:05.920
of going, and so forth.

01:27:05.920 --> 01:27:10.480
But nope, Sega West CEO Mike Hayes said that new info regarding the second chapter should

01:27:10.480 --> 01:27:13.640
be out soon.

01:27:13.640 --> 01:27:16.080
No more info, no date, just soon.

01:27:16.080 --> 01:27:19.480
Just basically saying, hey, the game hasn't fallen off the radar, it will come out, you

01:27:19.480 --> 01:27:20.960
know, eventually.

01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:25.640
He did mention that Episode 1 did get a million downloads across all the platforms, so it

01:27:25.640 --> 01:27:27.880
didn't do that bad.

01:27:27.880 --> 01:27:32.080
A game that should have done a hell of a lot better than it did was Rock Band 3, and a

01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:34.240
company is taking a second chance on the game.

01:27:34.240 --> 01:27:39.800
Because, you know, I guess MTV Games isn't really around anymore, so you can't really

01:27:39.800 --> 01:27:41.960
get new Rock Band 3.

01:27:41.960 --> 01:27:50.000
Well, Mad Catz is going to be basically re-releasing Rock Band 3 this holiday, with their peripherals.

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:54.480
It's a really weird type of thing to see a company come in and pick up a game for a re-release

01:27:54.480 --> 01:27:55.480
like that.

01:27:55.480 --> 01:27:56.720
Yeah, but they did the official peripherals.

01:27:56.720 --> 01:28:01.760
Yeah, but they're doing now the release of the game, which I think is kind of interesting.

01:28:01.760 --> 01:28:02.760
By the way-

01:28:02.760 --> 01:28:04.320
Well, they distributed the keyboard game bundles.

01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:05.320
Oh, they did, that's right.

01:28:05.320 --> 01:28:08.680
They did do the keyboard game bundles, so interesting.

01:28:08.680 --> 01:28:14.720
They will be doing, though, the guitar controller version and the drum kit version.

01:28:14.720 --> 01:28:19.860
They are, however, saying that so far the 360 is the only platform that the re-releases

01:28:19.860 --> 01:28:21.160
are confirmed for.

01:28:21.160 --> 01:28:25.760
They haven't said anything about the Wii or the PlayStation 3, so that part's kind of

01:28:25.760 --> 01:28:26.760
interesting.

01:28:26.760 --> 01:28:30.220
But you may see a resurgence of that game this holiday season, which is, you know, good.

01:28:30.220 --> 01:28:33.720
If you never picked up Rock Band 3 and you like music games at all, you really should

01:28:33.720 --> 01:28:35.200
check it out.

01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:36.760
Going over to Dark Sakura.

01:28:36.760 --> 01:28:42.800
Well, for fans of SingStar, there is a new version to be coming out, calling SingStar

01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:46.160
Back to the 80s, and it'll be out sometime before Christmas.

01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:48.000
Has 30 massive hits.

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:53.780
Now, I gotta ask, is it gonna have the song Back to the 80s?

01:28:53.780 --> 01:28:54.780
Like by Aqua?

01:28:54.780 --> 01:28:55.780
Yeah.

01:28:55.780 --> 01:28:56.780
And I doubt it.

01:28:56.780 --> 01:28:57.780
That wasn't an 80s song.

01:28:57.780 --> 01:28:58.780
But it'd be cool, though.

01:28:58.780 --> 01:28:59.780
It might be-

01:28:59.780 --> 01:29:01.560
But it's gonna have Whitesnake and Devo.

01:29:01.560 --> 01:29:04.240
It might be for sale on the SingStore.

01:29:04.240 --> 01:29:06.480
It may be Meatloaf.

01:29:06.480 --> 01:29:08.920
It better have Meatloaf.

01:29:08.920 --> 01:29:09.920
What's for dinner?

01:29:09.920 --> 01:29:11.480
Meatloaf, not again.

01:29:11.480 --> 01:29:14.480
Also, for Rock Band, we have a new pack.

01:29:14.480 --> 01:29:19.200
We have the Fall Out Boy Pack 1 with Dance Dance, Sugar We're Going Down, and Thanks

01:29:19.200 --> 01:29:20.200
for the Memers.

01:29:20.200 --> 01:29:23.160
Thanks for the Memers?

01:29:23.160 --> 01:29:26.160
It's Memories, but they decided to spell it like, I don't know.

01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:28.400
I know, but I like trying to say Memers.

01:29:28.400 --> 01:29:31.400
Cool kids don't use letters, Dark Sakura.

01:29:31.400 --> 01:29:32.400
Vowels.

01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:33.400
LOL.

01:29:33.400 --> 01:29:37.120
And then individually, we have Child in Time by Deep Purple.

01:29:37.120 --> 01:29:41.700
And actually, for Sugar We're Going Down, there will be a Pro Guitar Bass expansion

01:29:41.700 --> 01:29:44.920
available for 80 Microsoft points.

01:29:44.920 --> 01:29:54.960
And moving forward, we have for North America on September 9th, the Flame Red 3DS will be

01:29:54.960 --> 01:29:55.960
out.

01:29:55.960 --> 01:29:56.960
It's flaming.

01:29:56.960 --> 01:29:57.960
Yes, it is.

01:29:57.960 --> 01:30:00.480
Actually, I like-

01:30:00.480 --> 01:30:05.280
There was a DS in that exact same color, wasn't there?

01:30:05.280 --> 01:30:08.240
I like the name in Japan, that was Flare Red.

01:30:08.240 --> 01:30:10.080
I think that's kind of cool.

01:30:10.080 --> 01:30:12.920
But anyway, it's a 3DS, and it's red and black.

01:30:12.920 --> 01:30:14.160
The end.

01:30:14.160 --> 01:30:16.560
All right.

01:30:16.560 --> 01:30:20.960
By the way, guys, before we get back into some more long-form news, I do want to give

01:30:20.960 --> 01:30:25.200
one more shout-out for the Indie Game Spotlight that we're going to be doing on the show.

01:30:25.200 --> 01:30:28.040
Haven't had a whole lot of bites on that, so I don't know, I guess we must not have

01:30:28.040 --> 01:30:31.960
a lot of developers listen to the show, but again, if you or a friend are developing an

01:30:31.960 --> 01:30:41.840
independently produced game, either for iOS, PC, Xbox Live Arcade, or pretty much anything,

01:30:41.840 --> 01:30:46.320
we'll take a look at it, and maybe invite you on the show to talk about it, and hopefully

01:30:46.320 --> 01:30:47.320
get you noticed.

01:30:47.320 --> 01:30:50.320
Because right now, one of the biggest bitches we're hearing about that is, it's really hard

01:30:50.320 --> 01:30:54.600
to get noticed on Xbox Live Arcade, because A, Microsoft doesn't really highlight a lot

01:30:54.600 --> 01:30:58.260
of the indie stuff, and B, a lot of it is crap.

01:30:58.260 --> 01:31:00.800
There's a lot of crap out there, but there are a few good things.

01:31:00.800 --> 01:31:04.800
And if you believe you have a diamond in the rough, we want to call it out here on this

01:31:04.800 --> 01:31:05.800
program.

01:31:05.800 --> 01:31:08.040
So, coming soon to the program.

01:31:08.040 --> 01:31:11.320
And if we don't get a lot of developers to bite on that, we'll just kind of start spotlighting

01:31:11.320 --> 01:31:12.920
stuff we like.

01:31:12.920 --> 01:31:13.920
And that's where we'll go with it.

01:31:13.920 --> 01:31:17.760
Because we're committed to helping indie games get more acknowledgement.

01:31:17.760 --> 01:31:20.760
Because after all, we're an indie podcast, and we know it can be tough.

01:31:20.760 --> 01:31:25.960
Also, I want to give a plug, speaking of indie podcasts, to another show that we do here

01:31:25.960 --> 01:31:27.960
at OLR Network.

01:31:27.960 --> 01:31:34.120
It is Hoard House, the best little Hoard House in Azeroth, www.hoardhouse.com.

01:31:34.120 --> 01:31:39.140
If you like World of Warcraft, there's all sorts of fun stuff about WoW on that program.

01:31:39.140 --> 01:31:41.500
This week, especially, was a really fun show.

01:31:41.500 --> 01:31:43.460
We taped on an off day this week.

01:31:43.460 --> 01:31:46.360
We had a guy from Britain on the show, and it was fun.

01:31:46.360 --> 01:31:48.360
Rice Princess crashed the show about halfway through.

01:31:48.360 --> 01:31:51.080
I guess, she's not Rice Princess anymore, I'm supposed to call her Irene.

01:31:51.080 --> 01:31:52.680
She'll always be Rice Princess to me.

01:31:52.680 --> 01:31:56.240
She crashed the show about halfway through, and we were talking about PVP for a little

01:31:56.240 --> 01:31:57.240
while.

01:31:57.240 --> 01:31:58.240
It was cool.

01:31:58.240 --> 01:31:59.240
Good show.

01:31:59.240 --> 01:32:00.240
Let's check it out.

01:32:00.240 --> 01:32:01.640
Is she having withdrawals?

01:32:01.640 --> 01:32:05.080
It doesn't sound like it, but it was still nice to have her perspective, even though

01:32:05.080 --> 01:32:08.120
she's pretty comfortable in her decision to quit.

01:32:08.120 --> 01:32:11.440
But I think, you know what's funny is that most people that were on the show this week

01:32:11.440 --> 01:32:15.600
are on a bit of hiatus, but all of them were like, yeah, I'll come back eventually.

01:32:15.600 --> 01:32:19.720
And even Pete Caruno, who is our guest over from overseas, is like, I'm on a trial account

01:32:19.720 --> 01:32:21.480
right now, because it's free to play at a 20.

01:32:21.480 --> 01:32:24.640
He's like, I'm doing the free to play thing right now, and I rolled a rogue over on the

01:32:24.640 --> 01:32:27.300
US servers, just because I can.

01:32:27.300 --> 01:32:28.300
So that was cool.

01:32:28.300 --> 01:32:29.960
I've got a friend of mine playing now.

01:32:29.960 --> 01:32:31.100
Oh, cool.

01:32:31.100 --> 01:32:35.200
He's like, this is like fourth edition D&D, I like it.

01:32:35.200 --> 01:32:36.260
You would say that.

01:32:36.260 --> 01:32:38.520
So Hoardhouse.com, if you want to check that out.

01:32:38.520 --> 01:32:40.840
Yes, we're still working on a third podcast.

01:32:40.840 --> 01:32:46.760
Things just got slowed down because IRL trips and things, but more information on that soon.

01:32:46.760 --> 01:32:48.680
I was also a guest on Girls Gone Wow.

01:32:48.680 --> 01:32:49.680
Oh, yes.

01:32:49.680 --> 01:32:52.000
Please plug that, because I'm supposed to be on that show next week.

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:53.000
Yes.

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:56.160
And they said that Extrofer is welcome to participate.

01:32:56.160 --> 01:33:00.000
Yes, I've got to remember to talk to him about that.

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:01.000
The taping time.

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:02.000
Yes.

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:03.000
Because he'll probably be down.

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:06.120
GirlsGoneWow.net is their site?

01:33:06.120 --> 01:33:07.200
I believe so.

01:33:07.200 --> 01:33:10.120
It's not.com, because I think you get something else if you go there.

01:33:10.120 --> 01:33:11.120
It's.net.

01:33:11.120 --> 01:33:16.200
But they are lovely people, and they thank you for the biscuits.

01:33:16.200 --> 01:33:17.200
Awesome.

01:33:17.200 --> 01:33:18.200
Yes, it's.net.

01:33:18.200 --> 01:33:19.200
GirlsGoneWow.net.

01:33:19.200 --> 01:33:20.200
So check them out.

01:33:20.200 --> 01:33:24.400
I was on episode 25, and Rob will be on episode 26.

01:33:24.400 --> 01:33:25.400
Hooray.

01:33:25.400 --> 01:33:26.400
All right.

01:33:26.400 --> 01:33:27.400
Lots of Warcraft stuff.

01:33:27.400 --> 01:33:28.400
We also had a little bit of Doctor Who discussion.

01:33:28.400 --> 01:33:30.400
We do more than Warcraft, I promise.

01:33:30.400 --> 01:33:31.400
Oh, really?

01:33:31.400 --> 01:33:32.400
Yeah.

01:33:32.400 --> 01:33:33.400
Fun.

01:33:33.400 --> 01:33:34.400
It came up a little bit.

01:33:34.400 --> 01:33:35.400
Fun.

01:33:35.400 --> 01:33:36.400
All right.

01:33:36.400 --> 01:33:37.400
The new show has nothing to do with Warcraft.

01:33:37.400 --> 01:33:38.400
In fact, it's very much not about Warcraft.

01:33:38.400 --> 01:33:39.400
I'll say that much.

01:33:39.400 --> 01:33:41.840
If Dan's involved, it's not about Warcraft.

01:33:41.840 --> 01:33:42.840
Exactly.

01:33:42.840 --> 01:33:43.840
All right.

01:33:43.840 --> 01:33:47.840
Let's get back into some more long-form news, and Loki's going to start us off.

01:33:47.840 --> 01:33:48.840
Yes, I am.

01:33:48.840 --> 01:33:51.280
I want to take a break here from this game.

01:33:51.280 --> 01:33:52.280
You and that VVVVVVV.

01:33:52.280 --> 01:33:54.880
Hey, I'm getting pretty far.

01:33:54.880 --> 01:34:00.200
So Google Plus has started doing some games, and this is not a big surprise.

01:34:00.200 --> 01:34:02.160
We kind of knew this was going to happen.

01:34:02.160 --> 01:34:06.320
And of course, their rollout is a little bit like what we thought.

01:34:06.320 --> 01:34:13.020
They're going to have a separate game section, so you can play your games, and all the updates

01:34:13.020 --> 01:34:18.780
for those games are on one section, and they don't clutter up your feed or whatever.

01:34:18.780 --> 01:34:25.740
So of course, they're going to start off with Angry Birds, Dragon Age Legends, Sodoku, stuff

01:34:25.740 --> 01:34:27.320
of that sort.

01:34:27.320 --> 01:34:29.280
And you can check it out.

01:34:29.280 --> 01:34:31.680
They're going to be starting to roll out some more stuff.

01:34:31.680 --> 01:34:35.320
Yes, in the great Google tradition, not everybody had it right away.

01:34:35.320 --> 01:34:38.160
I got mine the day after this was announced, though.

01:34:38.160 --> 01:34:41.040
So I played Bejeweled Blitz on Google Games.

01:34:41.040 --> 01:34:44.320
I guess I forgot to say it at the top of the show, but I played Bejeweled Blitz on Google

01:34:44.320 --> 01:34:45.320
Games.

01:34:45.320 --> 01:34:49.760
So I have to say, I love that the game stuff is just on a separate frickin' page.

01:34:49.760 --> 01:34:56.520
And it sounds like that they're trying to be a little bit more of a destination for

01:34:56.520 --> 01:35:02.040
these developers, because they're offering, the commissions that they're taking from these

01:35:02.040 --> 01:35:04.440
games are a lot less than, say, Facebook.

01:35:04.440 --> 01:35:09.440
For example, VentureV is reporting that Google is only taking a 5% commission on its games,

01:35:09.440 --> 01:35:11.560
whereas Facebook takes 30.

01:35:11.560 --> 01:35:16.080
So that might be a little bit more beneficial for some of these developers out there.

01:35:16.080 --> 01:35:17.080
You know what, though?

01:35:17.080 --> 01:35:20.240
I honestly think it's going to get harder to be noticed on Google Games because they

01:35:20.240 --> 01:35:21.640
don't clutter your feet.

01:35:21.640 --> 01:35:25.640
I honestly think part of the reason why Farmville was so successful was that it did spam the

01:35:25.640 --> 01:35:27.060
shit out of everybody.

01:35:27.060 --> 01:35:31.680
And people who didn't know better, i.e. soccer moms, started playing it because they saw,

01:35:31.680 --> 01:35:33.160
oh, Ethel's playing this game.

01:35:33.160 --> 01:35:34.800
I should play it too.

01:35:34.800 --> 01:35:38.520
So I think that's a lot of how those games became so successful.

01:35:38.520 --> 01:35:42.000
So it's going to be interesting to see if the Google Games model is successful, because

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:47.200
honestly, how is going to a different page to see your game content any better than like,

01:35:47.200 --> 01:35:52.280
I don't know, MSN Zone is a website, Microsoft's site, where you can play games, but I bet

01:35:52.280 --> 01:35:54.120
a lot of people don't really play there.

01:35:54.120 --> 01:35:58.400
Going to a different page is that, you know, how different is that going to a different

01:35:58.400 --> 01:36:00.120
website to play your games?

01:36:00.120 --> 01:36:01.120
Exactly.

01:36:01.120 --> 01:36:02.120
I know, I know.

01:36:02.120 --> 01:36:05.000
But I will say this to Google's credit, it's clean.

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.720
Like I feel like when I go to Zone, MSN is very cluttered.

01:36:07.720 --> 01:36:09.400
There's ads everywhere, blah, blah, blah.

01:36:09.400 --> 01:36:13.400
You know, it's a cluttered website full of clutter.

01:36:13.400 --> 01:36:15.720
But Google Games, I thought, is pretty slick.

01:36:15.720 --> 01:36:19.680
Like, you know, one of the things people either love or they hate about Google Plus is that

01:36:19.680 --> 01:36:21.480
it's very plain.

01:36:21.480 --> 01:36:24.260
There's not a lot of flair to it right now.

01:36:24.260 --> 01:36:26.120
It's a very plain looking site.

01:36:26.120 --> 01:36:28.760
They don't really have ads at all right now.

01:36:28.760 --> 01:36:31.160
I don't know how long that's going to last.

01:36:31.160 --> 01:36:35.200
So it's a very clean site, and the games site kind of carries that on.

01:36:35.200 --> 01:36:41.040
So I did notice that Bejeweled Blitz was kind of skinned for Google Games.

01:36:41.040 --> 01:36:43.620
I mean, it looks like it was very specific towards that.

01:36:43.620 --> 01:36:46.320
So I didn't play anything else.

01:36:46.320 --> 01:36:47.320
That's the only one I played.

01:36:47.320 --> 01:36:49.440
But I'm down with it.

01:36:49.440 --> 01:36:52.560
I'm going to check out more Google Games if they get some more stuff I want to play.

01:36:52.560 --> 01:36:55.200
Like I don't know, Civ World could come out.

01:36:55.200 --> 01:36:56.360
That'd be great.

01:36:56.360 --> 01:36:57.920
I'd be into that.

01:36:57.920 --> 01:36:58.920
We'll see.

01:36:58.920 --> 01:37:04.520
Anyhow, going to our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

01:37:04.520 --> 01:37:08.240
Boykman is talking about Dragon Age and all that.

01:37:08.240 --> 01:37:12.800
It should be illegal to use games like Dragon Age in the same sentence as Angry Birds.

01:37:12.800 --> 01:37:17.080
Believe it or not, Dragon Age Legends is one of the launch games.

01:37:17.080 --> 01:37:18.080
I've never played that.

01:37:18.080 --> 01:37:21.240
Is that like Knights of the Clicky?

01:37:21.240 --> 01:37:22.240
I don't know.

01:37:22.240 --> 01:37:23.240
I don't think it's like that.

01:37:23.240 --> 01:37:29.040
I think it's more of like a simplified version, kind of like a Diablo-esque type of thing.

01:37:29.040 --> 01:37:30.040
That might actually be kind of fun.

01:37:30.040 --> 01:37:32.160
I'll have to check that out.

01:37:32.160 --> 01:37:33.160
Let's see.

01:37:33.160 --> 01:37:36.520
It says Bejeweled Blitz is good, but it only gives you one minute to play.

01:37:36.520 --> 01:37:37.520
That's kind of the point.

01:37:37.520 --> 01:37:39.960
I like the little bite-sized version of Bejeweled there.

01:37:39.960 --> 01:37:40.960
I kind of like it.

01:37:40.960 --> 01:37:46.400
So there you go, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

01:37:46.400 --> 01:37:47.920
Moving on to other stuff.

01:37:47.920 --> 01:37:49.320
This is another Nintendo story.

01:37:49.320 --> 01:37:51.560
This is very interesting.

01:37:51.560 --> 01:37:55.620
Very interesting patent that they filed in this past.

01:37:55.620 --> 01:37:58.080
Actually they filed it back in 2010.

01:37:58.080 --> 01:38:00.960
It was discovered within this past week.

01:38:00.960 --> 01:38:06.080
GameSpot actually found the filing this week, and Nintendo filed the patent for a massively

01:38:06.080 --> 01:38:09.320
single-player online game.

01:38:09.320 --> 01:38:12.520
You've heard massively multiplayer online game all the time, I'm sure.

01:38:12.520 --> 01:38:17.720
But no, they want to do an MSO, a massively single-player online game.

01:38:17.720 --> 01:38:18.960
GameSpot found the filing.

01:38:18.960 --> 01:38:23.940
The MSO, I guess, would be an environment where your actions and choices affect the

01:38:23.940 --> 01:38:26.840
world that they and everyone else live in.

01:38:26.840 --> 01:38:33.360
So, for example, an economic system, or maybe a case where a player finds building materials

01:38:33.360 --> 01:38:37.200
and they make a house, then all the other players are going to see the house, just not

01:38:37.200 --> 01:38:38.200
the owner.

01:38:38.200 --> 01:38:41.040
And I'm imagining they're not going to see the material either.

01:38:41.040 --> 01:38:46.560
I guess there's an idea, too, where players would gossip to an AI non-player character

01:38:46.560 --> 01:38:49.040
who spreads it to other characters in the world.

01:38:49.040 --> 01:38:53.120
And of course, that instantly made my brain go, oh, it's Animal Crossing.

01:38:53.120 --> 01:38:56.080
Which I'm sure a lot of people are thinking at this point.

01:38:56.080 --> 01:38:59.680
Well, and not to say this is the first game that's been kind of single-player, but yet

01:38:59.680 --> 01:39:02.640
had sort of the multiplayer title like Demon's Souls.

01:39:02.640 --> 01:39:03.640
Well, it's funny.

01:39:03.640 --> 01:39:05.600
Bobby was talking about this on his show right before that.

01:39:05.600 --> 01:39:09.640
He's like, I don't see why Nintendo, I guess I should properly plug his show.

01:39:09.640 --> 01:39:13.400
He's always before us here at All Games Radio, but he's on at 5 Pacific.

01:39:13.400 --> 01:39:16.920
Bobby Blackwolf at bobbyblackwolf.com was talking about this subject tonight a little

01:39:16.920 --> 01:39:18.320
more in depth on his show.

01:39:18.320 --> 01:39:21.600
And he said, I can think of two right off the top of my head that already do this.

01:39:21.600 --> 01:39:23.240
And he said Demon's Souls.

01:39:23.240 --> 01:39:31.120
And the other one was, I fucking forgot, it was a PC game.

01:39:31.120 --> 01:39:33.480
It's going to come to me as soon as somebody yells it out in chat.

01:39:33.480 --> 01:39:35.800
I can't remember what the other one was, but there's another game.

01:39:35.800 --> 01:39:37.960
Random game on the PC.

01:39:37.960 --> 01:39:39.200
That was exactly like it.

01:39:39.200 --> 01:39:43.040
I think he was saying, he was trying to say Diablo 3 was kind of part of this too, where

01:39:43.040 --> 01:39:47.020
Diablo 3 has a single-player mode, but yet it's going to have this auction house that's

01:39:47.020 --> 01:39:48.480
more massive.

01:39:48.480 --> 01:39:52.480
So it's interesting that Nintendo would be getting a patent on this when it's kind of

01:39:52.480 --> 01:39:55.920
already been done, and can they really do that, IDK.

01:39:55.920 --> 01:40:02.400
Well, especially if the patent was in 2010, Demon's Souls came out in 2010.

01:40:02.400 --> 01:40:03.400
No, 09.

01:40:03.400 --> 01:40:04.400
09.

01:40:04.400 --> 01:40:08.520
Yeah, it was two years ago, I saw that game the first time it was 09.

01:40:08.520 --> 01:40:09.520
That might be tough.

01:40:09.520 --> 01:40:10.520
Yeah, it might be tough.

01:40:10.520 --> 01:40:15.240
Apparently, if players friend one another, they will be able to see and interact with

01:40:15.240 --> 01:40:16.240
each other.

01:40:16.240 --> 01:40:17.240
Fable.

01:40:17.240 --> 01:40:18.240
Well, actually the heck co-op.

01:40:18.240 --> 01:40:19.240
It was Spore.

01:40:19.240 --> 01:40:20.240
Spore.

01:40:20.240 --> 01:40:21.240
Spore was the other game that he mentioned.

01:40:21.240 --> 01:40:23.680
Because I remember going, oh yeah, I played that for like a week.

01:40:23.680 --> 01:40:29.120
But yes, Spore was very much, remember you would make your little monster, and then it

01:40:29.120 --> 01:40:33.320
kind of went off into the Spore universe, and the universe was made up of other creatures

01:40:33.320 --> 01:40:36.240
that other people had made, but you never played the game with these people.

01:40:36.240 --> 01:40:38.180
It's just that the players made the environment.

01:40:38.180 --> 01:40:42.360
And that game was out in 08, I think.

01:40:42.360 --> 01:40:48.040
To a lesser extent, you could even say that the Wii with people's Miis, because you share

01:40:48.040 --> 01:40:51.880
the Miis and they pop up in games sometimes.

01:40:51.880 --> 01:40:59.280
Anyhow, let's see, what else do I want to say about this patent?

01:40:59.280 --> 01:41:04.080
More, the filing talks about how the game has to be suitable for play on something called

01:41:04.080 --> 01:41:06.820
the Wii 3D.

01:41:06.820 --> 01:41:11.040
This was filed, of course, in 2010, so maybe at one point the Wii U was going to be the

01:41:11.040 --> 01:41:15.380
Wii 3D, or the 3DS was the Wii 3D at one point.

01:41:15.380 --> 01:41:17.380
Who knows, but don't read too far into that.

01:41:17.380 --> 01:41:20.360
I'm sure this does not mean Wii 3D confirmed.

01:41:20.360 --> 01:41:25.360
I'm sure that Nintendo explores a lot of options about what they're going to do, and files

01:41:25.360 --> 01:41:29.080
patents to cover their butt.

01:41:29.080 --> 01:41:32.240
It's just interesting that Nintendo would go for something like this when, yeah, I think

01:41:32.240 --> 01:41:38.040
we have examples of other games that already kind of have done this, so it would be a little

01:41:38.040 --> 01:41:41.040
bit crappy if Nintendo gets it.

01:41:41.040 --> 01:41:45.720
I mean, only if Nintendo decides to go after these other developers, but then again, if

01:41:45.720 --> 01:41:51.560
I were the company that made Demon Souls from software, I would be all like, F you Nintendo,

01:41:51.560 --> 01:41:55.560
we have this game that was out a long time ago.

01:41:55.560 --> 01:41:58.600
Just because they do that, though, can they still patent it?

01:41:58.600 --> 01:42:02.300
Like, if I come up with something but I don't patent it, then they do?

01:42:02.300 --> 01:42:06.600
The whole patent system in this country is fucked up anyway, and again, I'm going to

01:42:06.600 --> 01:42:11.840
defer to Bobby's show because he puts it better than I do, but just talking about how it's

01:42:11.840 --> 01:42:16.960
ridiculous that you can patent all these software concepts, and if you want to see the headache

01:42:16.960 --> 01:42:20.120
it's causing, just look at all this bullshit with Load Sys.

01:42:20.120 --> 01:42:23.160
Load Sys is specifically a patent troll company.

01:42:23.160 --> 01:42:30.320
There is no office, there's nothing to Load Sys besides some troll, literally a troll,

01:42:30.320 --> 01:42:35.520
sitting under the bridge begging for money, or demanding money in this case, with their

01:42:35.520 --> 01:42:39.360
stock of patents, and that's kind of screwed up.

01:42:39.360 --> 01:42:40.520
Something needs to be done.

01:42:40.520 --> 01:42:44.640
Doing hardware, that's a little different, I get that, but a lot of this software patent,

01:42:44.640 --> 01:42:48.920
and the other example I know that Bobby always brings up, again, just to totally buy to show,

01:42:48.920 --> 01:42:50.880
is the one click thing from Amazon.

01:42:50.880 --> 01:42:53.880
It's ridiculous that Amazon has a patent on one click.

01:42:53.880 --> 01:42:57.080
The whole one click to buy, one click to purchase, nobody else can do that.

01:42:57.080 --> 01:42:58.720
Amazon has the patent on it.

01:42:58.720 --> 01:42:59.720
That's ridiculous.

01:42:59.720 --> 01:43:04.440
In my opinion, you're patenting something that's kind of like a key functionality of

01:43:04.440 --> 01:43:05.960
the internet, a link.

01:43:05.960 --> 01:43:11.920
I'm patenting the Q key.

01:43:11.920 --> 01:43:17.680
I patent device to create Q by pressing button.

01:43:17.680 --> 01:43:21.240
Anyhow, it's interesting to see what comes out, of course it's just a patent, it doesn't

01:43:21.240 --> 01:43:26.180
mean new Animal Crossing confirmed, I mean, those Animal Crossing games do that.

01:43:26.180 --> 01:43:28.600
New Animal Crossing confirmed, really?

01:43:28.600 --> 01:43:29.600
They do sell things well, right?

01:43:29.600 --> 01:43:31.600
Another system, another Animal Crossing.

01:43:31.600 --> 01:43:35.920
I think you're going to see another Animal Crossing regardless.

01:43:35.920 --> 01:43:41.020
It could be something, I mean, we are assuming it's Animal Crossing, but to not assume it's

01:43:41.020 --> 01:43:46.080
Animal Crossing would be to then assume that Nintendo is doing something different.

01:43:46.080 --> 01:43:48.440
I'm going to take the safer bet and say it's Animal Crossing.

01:43:48.440 --> 01:43:50.760
I don't know about you guys.

01:43:50.760 --> 01:43:52.680
Nintendo, different.

01:43:52.680 --> 01:43:55.920
They just put different in the same packaging.

01:43:55.920 --> 01:43:59.280
Blakeman in our chat room says, you can be a professional troll.

01:43:59.280 --> 01:44:03.900
Why was I not informed and where do I get an application?

01:44:03.900 --> 01:44:08.120
I'm sorry, but trolls more qualified than you have already applied.

01:44:08.120 --> 01:44:11.200
Those doing the interviews were thoroughly insulted, therefore they were hired.

01:44:11.200 --> 01:44:14.200
All right, anyhow, let's move on with some more news.

01:44:14.200 --> 01:44:17.320
Actually, no, the mailbag, mailbag is up now.

01:44:17.320 --> 01:44:18.380
Let's get to it.

01:44:18.380 --> 01:44:22.320
Every week here on Orange Lounge Radio, Dark Soccer likes to open up the mail, dive in

01:44:22.320 --> 01:44:24.480
head first and pull out some emails to read for you.

01:44:24.480 --> 01:44:25.780
I like to.

01:44:25.780 --> 01:44:26.780
You have to.

01:44:26.780 --> 01:44:30.840
Because the music's playing, so therefore you must.

01:44:30.840 --> 01:44:35.160
Blake at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to email us sometime.

01:44:35.160 --> 01:44:36.160
Let's get to it.

01:44:36.160 --> 01:44:40.420
I'm also going to again say that if you send multiple emails, I'm only going to read one

01:44:40.420 --> 01:44:41.420
of them.

01:44:41.420 --> 01:44:43.200
So do not take offense.

01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:48.360
That being said, if you send one email that's like 500 pages, she might trim it down too.

01:44:48.360 --> 01:44:52.160
Or just not read it or just put it on the form or something.

01:44:52.160 --> 01:44:53.160
Hi, O.L.R.

01:44:53.160 --> 01:44:57.000
You've been talking about Capcom a lot lately and it reminded me of something.

01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:00.880
Back in 08 when I visited Japan, I made it a point to hunt down the Capcom building.

01:45:00.880 --> 01:45:04.800
Though I couldn't read the website, I used Google to loosely translate the addresses

01:45:04.800 --> 01:45:09.240
on it until I found a likely one and had a cab take me to the building.

01:45:09.240 --> 01:45:10.620
The guard there was pretty surprised.

01:45:10.620 --> 01:45:13.940
My husband and I were looking around for maybe a store or something, but it was just a building

01:45:13.940 --> 01:45:16.040
with a big old Capcom logo on the side.

01:45:16.040 --> 01:45:19.280
The guard asked us if we need help and we told him we were tourists and wanted to see

01:45:19.280 --> 01:45:22.120
the Capcom building and if it had a gift shop or anything.

01:45:22.120 --> 01:45:26.960
Well, this guard goes inside and brings back the public relations manager for Capcom Japan.

01:45:26.960 --> 01:45:30.400
We thought it was so cool, she kept apologizing that we'd gone out of our way to see the building

01:45:30.400 --> 01:45:32.160
and there wasn't a store or anything.

01:45:32.160 --> 01:45:34.640
We told her it was still great and we love Okami.

01:45:34.640 --> 01:45:38.320
She gave us folders about investing in Capcom and her business card, so I thought I'd send

01:45:38.320 --> 01:45:40.280
it along to you here.

01:45:40.280 --> 01:45:41.520
Just something cool you might like.

01:45:41.520 --> 01:45:44.280
I'm not sure if she still works there now.

01:45:44.280 --> 01:45:46.440
Here's a link to the pic on my DeviantArt page.

01:45:46.440 --> 01:45:47.960
Sorry about the watermark.

01:45:47.960 --> 01:45:48.960
Sometimes that gets fixed.

01:45:48.960 --> 01:45:51.320
I swear DeviantArt randomly turns it on sometimes.

01:45:51.320 --> 01:45:52.320
That's from Holly D.

01:45:52.320 --> 01:45:53.520
Oh my God, I love it.

01:45:53.520 --> 01:45:58.080
Here's a pamphlet on investing in Capcom.

01:45:58.080 --> 01:45:59.080
Hey again.

01:45:59.080 --> 01:46:00.080
There's the picture of the building.

01:46:00.080 --> 01:46:02.320
I want to come look at this over here over your shoulder.

01:46:02.320 --> 01:46:05.640
I guess we can't Tumblr these because these are private pictures.

01:46:05.640 --> 01:46:06.640
It's on DeviantArt.

01:46:06.640 --> 01:46:07.640
Alright.

01:46:07.640 --> 01:46:10.120
Well, I don't know if we want to give away her DeviantArt.

01:46:10.120 --> 01:46:13.800
We'll leave it to Holly to go post them on the forums if she wants to share, but yeah,

01:46:13.800 --> 01:46:14.800
okay.

01:46:14.800 --> 01:46:17.200
Okay, that's kind of what you expect out of a video game building.

01:46:17.200 --> 01:46:18.200
They're not all that glamorous.

01:46:18.200 --> 01:46:20.120
It's pretty cool.

01:46:20.120 --> 01:46:25.040
The Zynga building in San Francisco, which used to be Sega is the, uh, just a brick building.

01:46:25.040 --> 01:46:28.960
Here is the, uh, oh, it's actually downloading the, no, it's opening it.

01:46:28.960 --> 01:46:34.020
That's what her car is, Chiho Tamoto.

01:46:34.020 --> 01:46:35.020
That's cute.

01:46:35.020 --> 01:46:36.020
What's on the other page?

01:46:36.020 --> 01:46:37.800
Was there a, is there a second page there?

01:46:37.800 --> 01:46:39.800
There's another, there's an image.

01:46:39.800 --> 01:46:40.800
Ooh.

01:46:40.800 --> 01:46:42.800
That's her signature.

01:46:42.800 --> 01:46:43.800
Yeah.

01:46:43.800 --> 01:46:45.800
So kind of cool.

01:46:45.800 --> 01:46:46.800
Yeah.

01:46:46.800 --> 01:46:49.400
Let me see if there's anything else though included in this.

01:46:49.400 --> 01:46:50.400
Nope.

01:46:50.400 --> 01:46:52.480
Just the, I love that whole, here's some information.

01:46:52.480 --> 01:46:56.380
If you want to invest in the company, which, you know, again, if you want to really get

01:46:56.380 --> 01:46:59.240
your point across, you should invest in a company.

01:46:59.240 --> 01:47:01.400
You should invest in Capcom.

01:47:01.400 --> 01:47:03.200
I thought that was actually pretty nice.

01:47:03.200 --> 01:47:04.200
Yeah.

01:47:04.200 --> 01:47:05.200
That's pretty cool.

01:47:05.200 --> 01:47:08.880
Um, I think we should go to the Zynga building in San Francisco and say, we're really big

01:47:08.880 --> 01:47:10.880
Farmville fans.

01:47:10.880 --> 01:47:15.400
Go outside and overalls, I bought a hoe.

01:47:15.400 --> 01:47:17.440
We bought her on the corner outside your building.

01:47:17.440 --> 01:47:20.640
You call me Earl?

01:47:20.640 --> 01:47:26.120
Dear personages, ooh, after returning from my Vegas trip, during which I had a truly

01:47:26.120 --> 01:47:31.160
fun time, I gave myself an extra day to run errands and unwind just a little bit more.

01:47:31.160 --> 01:47:35.440
One of the things I did was I called up my local Walmart, called up the Walmart that

01:47:35.440 --> 01:47:41.080
is also on the same road, but slightly farther away from me and found myself $170 3DS.

01:47:41.080 --> 01:47:45.080
I also got a game because the gaming system without a game is just an expensive paperweight,

01:47:45.080 --> 01:47:47.080
much like my Sega game gear is now.

01:47:47.080 --> 01:47:52.640
I've got guardian heroes on game gear and you probably don't.

01:47:52.640 --> 01:47:56.680
Anyway, I'm not emailing you to gloat or be a braggart about my purchase.

01:47:56.680 --> 01:47:58.680
I'm being a braggart.

01:47:58.680 --> 01:48:00.920
But I just wanted to ask a question of you.

01:48:00.920 --> 01:48:06.360
Are any of your three, are any of you three aware of any pornographic websites that can

01:48:06.360 --> 01:48:08.520
be viewed on the Nintendo 3DS?

01:48:08.520 --> 01:48:11.760
I mean the thing connects to the internet and what is the internet good for other than

01:48:11.760 --> 01:48:15.920
whacking off and complaining about, among other things, not being able to whack off.

01:48:15.920 --> 01:48:17.020
Stay black, writertainment.

01:48:17.020 --> 01:48:20.160
This message is brought to you by Heaven, otherwise known as the Coca Cola store in

01:48:20.160 --> 01:48:21.400
Las Vegas.

01:48:21.400 --> 01:48:27.000
Well, writertainment, you can visit any porn website on your 3DS because your 3DS has an

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:28.280
internet browser in it.

01:48:28.280 --> 01:48:32.880
I think you really want to be asking, are there 3D porno websites out there?

01:48:32.880 --> 01:48:34.160
Let's look.

01:48:34.160 --> 01:48:40.320
None that I know of yet, but Dark Sakura, let me Google that for you.

01:48:40.320 --> 01:48:43.000
Dark Sakura is going to search right now for...

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:46.000
Nintendo 3DS boobs.

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:49.400
Why don't you just Google 3D porn?

01:48:49.400 --> 01:48:52.480
3D website porn.

01:48:52.480 --> 01:48:54.800
3DS porn.

01:48:54.800 --> 01:48:59.680
There is actually a pack you can get that someone made that's a bunch of 3D pictures

01:48:59.680 --> 01:49:01.320
that you can upload to your device.

01:49:01.320 --> 01:49:03.920
They're not pornographic though, they're just like...

01:49:03.920 --> 01:49:05.920
Like sexy swimsuits and things like that?

01:49:05.920 --> 01:49:06.920
Like lingerie.

01:49:06.920 --> 01:49:12.080
It's like some, it's some uh, like uh, idol.

01:49:12.080 --> 01:49:16.720
Well then I'll leave it to the chat room to try and uh, fill us in on some 3D porno.

01:49:16.720 --> 01:49:21.040
But hey, you know what though, I mean, there's people out there, they have 3D cameras.

01:49:21.040 --> 01:49:24.120
I'm sure people have taken 3D pornographic...

01:49:24.120 --> 01:49:28.680
You know that, look, here's, look, let me just break it down.

01:49:28.680 --> 01:49:30.960
I'm just gonna break it down.

01:49:30.960 --> 01:49:35.340
Every 3DS has a 3D camera in it.

01:49:35.340 --> 01:49:40.840
Pictures of boobs and penises were taken within seconds of the 3DS launch.

01:49:40.840 --> 01:49:42.680
So those pictures are out there somewhere.

01:49:42.680 --> 01:49:47.000
It's just a matter of having a place to share those pictures.

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:52.160
We should just start a website called my3dsboobs.com and all it would be is pictures of your boobs

01:49:52.160 --> 01:49:54.720
in 3D for women who'd want to share.

01:49:54.720 --> 01:49:57.080
Do we know women that might share pictures of their boobies with us?

01:49:57.080 --> 01:50:00.840
Um, dark, dark soccer, I'm not even going to ask because I know you'd be like, no, they're

01:50:00.840 --> 01:50:01.840
my boobies.

01:50:01.840 --> 01:50:06.240
If they will, then send them to me.

01:50:06.240 --> 01:50:09.000
I will enjoy them with my husband.

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:10.000
All right.

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:13.040
Next email from Chiggers.

01:50:13.040 --> 01:50:17.600
Has anyone tried the demo for the indie game No Luca No on Xbox?

01:50:17.600 --> 01:50:21.760
The whole demo is you swatting Luca the cat away from your cereal.

01:50:21.760 --> 01:50:26.120
I don't know if the whole game is like that, but I giggled like a school girl, TEEHEE.

01:50:26.120 --> 01:50:28.080
Give dark Sakura tacos cause she deserves it.

01:50:28.080 --> 01:50:29.080
P.S.

01:50:29.080 --> 01:50:30.320
I haven't seen you guys on Drendin in a while.

01:50:30.320 --> 01:50:31.320
We're art thou.

01:50:31.320 --> 01:50:32.400
I miss you.

01:50:32.400 --> 01:50:35.880
I'm only able to check in like once a week cause I'm really busy with raiding now.

01:50:35.880 --> 01:50:39.760
All of a sudden we are actually doing that, but I will check in on the Drendin Guild very

01:50:39.760 --> 01:50:40.760
soon.

01:50:40.760 --> 01:50:41.760
I do at least once a week.

01:50:41.760 --> 01:50:42.760
I have an idea.

01:50:42.760 --> 01:50:43.760
What?

01:50:43.760 --> 01:50:44.760
Tuesday, let's have a Drendinathon.

01:50:44.760 --> 01:50:45.760
We'll see.

01:50:45.760 --> 01:50:50.320
I got to check the personal calendar, but maybe, maybe Drendinathon, Drendinathon.

01:50:50.320 --> 01:50:54.680
Uh, otherwise, uh, as far as the whole Luca, the cat or whatever that game was called.

01:50:54.680 --> 01:50:58.840
No, I've never played that game, but I'm going to, as soon as I, Oh, I fucking can't.

01:50:58.840 --> 01:51:01.720
I will in 21 days when the investigation is complete.

01:51:01.720 --> 01:51:02.720
Thanks Microsoft.

01:51:02.720 --> 01:51:06.840
I'm actually looking up No Luca No and there's a video on here.

01:51:06.840 --> 01:51:09.880
This is worst X-Box live game ever on YouTube.

01:51:09.880 --> 01:51:10.880
Okay.

01:51:10.880 --> 01:51:14.560
I'm going to have to just send you the link to this Rob so that you can pull it up.

01:51:14.560 --> 01:51:16.880
By the way, Black Wolf is on it right now.

01:51:16.880 --> 01:51:20.880
He makes websites, so I'm assuming that Black Wolf is currently in the process of making

01:51:20.880 --> 01:51:22.620
3DS boobs right now.

01:51:22.620 --> 01:51:25.360
So we'll, we'll just wait on that.

01:51:25.360 --> 01:51:29.800
Oh, you're going to send me the link here?

01:51:29.800 --> 01:51:30.800
I sent you a video.

01:51:30.800 --> 01:51:35.080
Is there someone talking over it, but I don't want to hear some asshole talking over the

01:51:35.080 --> 01:51:37.120
thing, just look it up on, on whatever.

01:51:37.120 --> 01:51:39.400
I'll read the next email.

01:51:39.400 --> 01:51:40.800
Hi Rob, Jamie and Loki.

01:51:40.800 --> 01:51:44.120
I just wanted to say, keep up the amazing work and dedication to your fans.

01:51:44.120 --> 01:51:50.240
And by the way, Jamie, I wanted to inform you about a website, please use the website

01:51:50.240 --> 01:51:55.840
is abandonedonia.com, A-B-A-N-D-O-N-I-A.com.

01:51:55.840 --> 01:52:01.480
The website hosts abandonware and such, although I would verify its legality because I honestly

01:52:01.480 --> 01:52:03.680
didn't pay much attention to it lol.

01:52:03.680 --> 01:52:10.600
I was looking for a copy of SimTower for my PC and found it on this floating site, so.

01:52:10.600 --> 01:52:14.700
Also I know it's technically ultra lame to plug a podcast that is unrelated to said current

01:52:14.700 --> 01:52:22.740
podcast on said podcast lol, but I would appreciate it if you would plug my podcast, Beeeeeeeeeeeeeep.

01:52:22.740 --> 01:52:23.740
Sorry.

01:52:23.740 --> 01:52:25.000
Square Tech Podcast.

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.000
The first episode hasn't been posted yet.

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:28.000
Beeeeeeeeeep.

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:33.800
But you can view the site associated with my show at Beeeeeeeeeep, where we talk about

01:52:33.800 --> 01:52:34.800
Beeeeeeeeeep.

01:52:34.800 --> 01:52:35.800
Beeeeeeeeeep.

01:52:35.800 --> 01:52:38.840
Thank you, you guys rock my socks.

01:52:38.840 --> 01:52:43.520
Okay, it's squarepowered.com.

01:52:43.520 --> 01:52:45.240
You're so kind.

01:52:45.240 --> 01:52:46.640
Beeeeeeeeeep.

01:52:46.640 --> 01:52:49.560
Last email, revised.

01:52:49.560 --> 01:52:53.120
Some tips on reducing the pain and cost of an account hack.

01:52:53.120 --> 01:52:55.160
Oh, this is from Alan.

01:52:55.160 --> 01:52:58.120
I'm going to read the whole thing.

01:52:58.120 --> 01:52:59.120
OLR.

01:52:59.120 --> 01:53:03.600
So, after what happened to Rob this weekend, I thought it might be nice to try and put

01:53:03.600 --> 01:53:08.680
together a PSA on account fraud since I had to deal with so much of it at the porn place.

01:53:08.680 --> 01:53:09.680
Keep in mind...

01:53:09.680 --> 01:53:13.200
Sorry, I'm watching a video of NoLukaNo, it's adorable.

01:53:13.200 --> 01:53:16.040
I can't play it because it's got douchebags talking over it.

01:53:16.040 --> 01:53:17.800
Oh my god, that looks great.

01:53:17.800 --> 01:53:22.560
All you do, all it is, you just push the stick to shoo the cat away.

01:53:22.560 --> 01:53:23.560
That's all it is.

01:53:23.560 --> 01:53:26.320
That's not your cereal, it's my cereal.

01:53:26.320 --> 01:53:29.240
That's so dopey, I love it.

01:53:29.240 --> 01:53:30.240
Alright, serious topics.

01:53:30.240 --> 01:53:31.640
Xbox Live Hacking, yes.

01:53:31.640 --> 01:53:36.200
Keep in mind that having an account compromised and seeing false charges on a bank account

01:53:36.200 --> 01:53:39.880
will always be as stressful, infuriating, and scary.

01:53:39.880 --> 01:53:43.280
There is no painless way to deal with this, but there are things that you can do to protect

01:53:43.280 --> 01:53:46.360
yourself, so the nightmare is significantly less maddening.

01:53:46.360 --> 01:53:47.400
1.

01:53:47.400 --> 01:53:50.720
If you're comfortable confirming that the fraud is isolated to one account because the

01:53:50.720 --> 01:53:56.280
card used was on file and not actually revealed to anyone, try to have the firm handle it

01:53:56.280 --> 01:53:57.280
first.

01:53:57.280 --> 01:54:00.500
Some places refuse to do repeat business with the customer who has filed a charge back against

01:54:00.500 --> 01:54:04.400
them without contacting them, which might matter if you want to keep a relationship

01:54:04.400 --> 01:54:05.760
with them.

01:54:05.760 --> 01:54:09.280
Many will panic and immediately have their bank kill and reissue everything, potentially

01:54:09.280 --> 01:54:13.040
overkill and an added nightmare of work if it is not truly needed.

01:54:13.040 --> 01:54:14.040
2.

01:54:14.040 --> 01:54:17.920
Change your password on any site you can think of that might be billing you via automation,

01:54:17.920 --> 01:54:20.700
Netflix, your cell phone company, whatever.

01:54:20.700 --> 01:54:24.320
Many people only slightly tweet passwords from site to site to keep them unique, so

01:54:24.320 --> 01:54:26.940
doing this is great for your peace of mind.

01:54:26.940 --> 01:54:31.160
Also consider changing the email accounts for your login to those memberships to something

01:54:31.160 --> 01:54:35.000
new, and also change the screen name if you can do so seamlessly.

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:36.000
3.

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:37.660
Sadly, not everyone can do this one.

01:54:37.660 --> 01:54:42.420
Keep recurring digital services all on the same credit card, and most importantly, a

01:54:42.420 --> 01:54:46.600
card that has its balance against credit, not a debit card that has its balance against

01:54:46.600 --> 01:54:47.600
cash.

01:54:47.600 --> 01:54:52.960
If you decide that a firm sucks ass and you're over it, it's much easier for a bank to

01:54:52.960 --> 01:54:57.720
issue charge backs against stolen credit versus real electronically transferred cash.

01:54:57.720 --> 01:55:01.360
Some banks have little to no buyer protection when it comes to online fraud made against

01:55:01.360 --> 01:55:02.360
money.

01:55:02.360 --> 01:55:04.160
Also, be prepared to wait.

01:55:04.160 --> 01:55:07.240
You can always escalate to a manager, but generally telling people you need this money

01:55:07.240 --> 01:55:14.360
within 24 hours to pay rent, or even if it is true, will not accomplish much other than

01:55:14.360 --> 01:55:16.300
making the rep feel like crap.

01:55:16.300 --> 01:55:20.160
That Rob has to wait 21 days after doing all of his due diligence to get a refund is not

01:55:20.160 --> 01:55:21.320
uncommon.

01:55:21.320 --> 01:55:23.160
I can vouch for that too.

01:55:23.160 --> 01:55:24.160
4.

01:55:24.160 --> 01:55:25.160
Still nervous?

01:55:25.160 --> 01:55:28.520
Check with the firm that's issuing the refund to make sure it won't mess with the deposit

01:55:28.520 --> 01:55:32.920
if you got a new card number, and then have your bank issue a new card anyway.

01:55:32.920 --> 01:55:36.320
All they need to know is that you had something compromised, but it's been taken care of,

01:55:36.320 --> 01:55:37.780
and that you want a new card.

01:55:37.780 --> 01:55:43.720
Be wary of eating FedEx costs if it is also your debit slash ATM and you need it overnight.

01:55:43.720 --> 01:55:44.720
P.S.

01:55:44.720 --> 01:55:46.400
I want to thank my Jamie's Pinkberry for reading all of this.

01:55:46.400 --> 01:55:47.600
It was originally much longer.

01:55:47.600 --> 01:55:48.600
Frowny face.

01:55:48.600 --> 01:55:49.600
Hey.

01:55:49.600 --> 01:55:50.600
Toodles.

01:55:50.600 --> 01:55:51.600
Salacious pop.

01:55:51.600 --> 01:55:52.600
Don't give away my money.

01:55:52.600 --> 01:55:56.360
No, those are all some good tips, and I know he kind of used to work in a, um, sales type

01:55:56.360 --> 01:55:59.960
of environment and probably had to deal right with all that stuff on the front line.

01:55:59.960 --> 01:56:05.960
Um, so since I worked for a mortgage company too, I can tell you that it is incredibly

01:56:05.960 --> 01:56:10.640
easy for anyone who has a little bit of your personal information to call in and impersonate

01:56:10.640 --> 01:56:11.640
you.

01:56:11.640 --> 01:56:14.920
So I'm going to tell you what I used to do.

01:56:14.920 --> 01:56:20.720
Every so often, um, involved in mortgage situations when we would have people call in for payoffs

01:56:20.720 --> 01:56:26.000
on their, on their mortgage, um, you see as their prepayment penalty, something like that,

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:33.960
we would have their, um, the new loan officers call in and impersonate the customers because

01:56:33.960 --> 01:56:37.080
they had all of their personal information right there.

01:56:37.080 --> 01:56:41.980
And if I at any point ever suspected it, then I would put them on hold, call the customer

01:56:41.980 --> 01:56:44.480
and say, I think someone's impersonating you.

01:56:44.480 --> 01:56:46.360
I'm going to three way you.

01:56:46.360 --> 01:56:51.600
Usually screwed, you know, a person out of a mortgage, but, um, we would have spouses

01:56:51.600 --> 01:56:56.400
call, we'd have exes call in and because they had, they were privy to all that information.

01:56:56.400 --> 01:57:01.440
So you, if you also, another thing that will help is it with any of your, um, facilities

01:57:01.440 --> 01:57:09.040
that you can work with on a phone, if they have a password set up verbally, set it up.

01:57:09.040 --> 01:57:13.280
I don't want to, I really don't like to talk about my day job on the show cause I try to

01:57:13.280 --> 01:57:15.560
keep my work life and my nightlife separate.

01:57:15.560 --> 01:57:22.280
But I will say that, um, for many years I worked in a health insurance call center environment

01:57:22.280 --> 01:57:27.160
and I will tell you there's many strict laws about what type of information can be given.

01:57:27.160 --> 01:57:29.160
Cause you know, you're talking about people's health information.

01:57:29.160 --> 01:57:33.560
There's there's strict federal laws about what can and can't be said, uh, in a conversation.

01:57:33.560 --> 01:57:40.000
And honestly, part of me is kind of like, I think we need strict laws like that for

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.480
everything no matter what the industry is.

01:57:42.480 --> 01:57:48.560
Well, a lot of companies take good care, but clearly my information is at risk in some

01:57:48.560 --> 01:57:49.560
places.

01:57:49.560 --> 01:57:51.120
I was such a snot as a customer service rep.

01:57:51.120 --> 01:57:56.880
Well, keep in mind, I also took escalated calls cause I got promoted to a training rep

01:57:56.880 --> 01:58:02.640
and uh, I would actually start quoting the federal privacy act.

01:58:02.640 --> 01:58:08.600
I had, I had it saved as a pdf with parts highlighted and say, well, you can tell me

01:58:08.600 --> 01:58:09.600
that.

01:58:09.600 --> 01:58:11.940
I'm like, actually according to the federal privacy act, you know, and would read them

01:58:11.940 --> 01:58:14.240
line for line like, I want to talk to your manager.

01:58:14.240 --> 01:58:17.840
Well, my manager can't break the law either.

01:58:17.840 --> 01:58:18.840
Just hang up.

01:58:18.840 --> 01:58:19.840
All right.

01:58:19.840 --> 01:58:24.920
Anyhow, all good tips, all good tips, things I probably should have listened to before

01:58:24.920 --> 01:58:25.920
this happened.

01:58:25.920 --> 01:58:31.240
I also want to say that the federal privacy act came out in 1979, so look it up.

01:58:31.240 --> 01:58:34.600
That's before most of our listeners were born, believe it or not.

01:58:34.600 --> 01:58:35.600
All right.

01:58:35.600 --> 01:58:40.600
By the way, Bobby kind of Bobby found us a video of no Luca, no, that doesn't have somebody

01:58:40.600 --> 01:58:51.760
talking about 1974 no Luca, no.

01:58:51.760 --> 01:58:52.760
Every time it's no.

01:58:52.760 --> 01:58:55.160
And I guess you get points every time you shoot him away.

01:58:55.160 --> 01:58:56.160
No.

01:58:56.160 --> 01:58:58.280
Now does the game get like harder as you go through?

01:58:58.280 --> 01:58:59.280
Let me see.

01:58:59.280 --> 01:59:00.280
Fine.

01:59:00.280 --> 01:59:01.280
Just eat my breakfast.

01:59:01.280 --> 01:59:02.280
Fine.

01:59:02.280 --> 01:59:03.280
Just eat my breakfast.

01:59:03.280 --> 01:59:12.400
For the record, by the way, the federal privacy act of 1974, no, no one told me.

01:59:12.400 --> 01:59:13.400
I just looked up.

01:59:13.400 --> 01:59:14.400
All right.

01:59:14.400 --> 01:59:27.280
I want to know if this big flashing elephant is it's an elephant with tear.

01:59:27.280 --> 01:59:29.920
All right.

01:59:29.920 --> 01:59:31.240
Speaking of making people cry.

01:59:31.240 --> 01:59:36.900
Once in a while, we like to rant on this program.

01:59:36.900 --> 01:59:55.140
F.U. to the unemployment office here in California for switching people over to debit cards.

01:59:55.140 --> 01:59:58.700
And the only reason I'm saying F.U. about this is actually my F.U. is really the Bank

01:59:58.700 --> 02:00:04.780
of America because California unemployment decided to go through Bank of America to issue

02:00:04.780 --> 02:00:05.780
debit cards.

02:00:05.780 --> 02:00:06.780
And that's fine.

02:00:06.780 --> 02:00:09.980
I have no problem with a debit card.

02:00:09.980 --> 02:00:15.620
And so far it was actually fairly easy to set it up to do a direct deposit when my money

02:00:15.620 --> 02:00:17.900
comes in into my checking account.

02:00:17.900 --> 02:00:18.900
So that's fine.

02:00:18.900 --> 02:00:21.980
I just have to do my, fill out my stupid form.

02:00:21.980 --> 02:00:25.540
But I set it up for my first deposit to do that and it's like, no, we're going to set

02:00:25.540 --> 02:00:27.380
it up for every deposit afterwards.

02:00:27.380 --> 02:00:29.020
It doesn't work on your first one.

02:00:29.020 --> 02:00:32.420
So that means I have to go to the bank and have them do a manual transfer.

02:00:32.420 --> 02:00:36.220
So Bank of America can suck my non-existent card.

02:00:36.220 --> 02:00:39.340
Loki, do you have any F.U.s of the week?

02:00:39.340 --> 02:00:40.340
Umm.

02:00:40.340 --> 02:00:48.340
I don't know if you get a KFC for only having seven out of the ten hot wings I wanted.

02:00:48.340 --> 02:00:50.100
Did you get shorted?

02:00:50.100 --> 02:00:51.100
Three hot wings?

02:00:51.100 --> 02:00:54.340
Well, they said that, well, we only have seven.

02:00:54.340 --> 02:00:56.260
We'll give you chicken tenders instead.

02:00:56.260 --> 02:00:58.260
I'm like, eh, fine.

02:00:58.260 --> 02:00:59.260
Not funny.

02:00:59.260 --> 02:01:00.260
I don't know.

02:01:00.260 --> 02:01:01.380
Alright, umm.

02:01:01.380 --> 02:01:04.020
These are serious, first world problems, Loki.

02:01:04.020 --> 02:01:05.220
Serious first world problems.

02:01:05.220 --> 02:01:11.500
Man, they substituted three of my hot wings for chicken tenders.

02:01:11.500 --> 02:01:15.280
My F.U. of the week goes to the fucker that stole 125 bucks from me.

02:01:15.280 --> 02:01:16.740
Fuck you, you fucking fuck.

02:01:16.740 --> 02:01:19.460
I feel a little better.

02:01:19.460 --> 02:01:20.460
Yeah!

02:01:20.460 --> 02:01:21.460
Burn his house down.

02:01:21.460 --> 02:01:23.460
No, don't burn my house down.

02:01:23.460 --> 02:01:25.300
No, I meant the fucker.

02:01:25.300 --> 02:01:30.260
It's probably, it's probably, it's got to be some mass operation overseas somewhere

02:01:30.260 --> 02:01:31.260
that's doing it.

02:01:31.260 --> 02:01:34.500
I bet anything it's some other country where they've got a shop of people that are hacking

02:01:34.500 --> 02:01:40.900
all these Xbox Live accounts somehow that probably, the information was probably breached

02:01:40.900 --> 02:01:42.680
and Microsoft just doesn't know it yet.

02:01:42.680 --> 02:01:45.980
You know, probably got stolen the same time as Sony's, but whatever, I don't want to make

02:01:45.980 --> 02:01:46.980
stuff up.

02:01:46.980 --> 02:01:50.420
But all I know is that I have money stolen and I'm pissed.

02:01:50.420 --> 02:01:54.860
But at least the lady that worked at Xbox.com was nice and she was nice enough to tell me

02:01:54.860 --> 02:01:57.060
that hey, she's had money stolen from her too.

02:01:57.060 --> 02:01:59.220
So gee, that makes me feel better.

02:01:59.220 --> 02:02:00.580
At least she was honest about it.

02:02:00.580 --> 02:02:04.220
I know at least she's honest about it and clearly it's not the first time she's gotten

02:02:04.220 --> 02:02:08.300
a call on it, but I'm a little concerned that they're so blasé about it.

02:02:08.300 --> 02:02:11.060
You know, like, oh yeah, yeah, it's happened to all of us.

02:02:11.060 --> 02:02:15.200
Like, oh, just like the fucking red rings of death fucking happened to all of us.

02:02:15.200 --> 02:02:19.540
Just like the fucking money gets stolen out of our bank account by hackers overseas.

02:02:19.540 --> 02:02:20.540
Oh, okay.

02:02:20.540 --> 02:02:27.180
I'll just kind of roll over and let you fuck me while you're, you know, it's, this is ridiculous.

02:02:27.180 --> 02:02:30.540
Microsoft keeps doing this and yet we all get mad at Sony.

02:02:30.540 --> 02:02:31.540
Rob.

02:02:31.540 --> 02:02:32.540
What?

02:02:32.540 --> 02:02:35.540
It's just irritating heart.

02:02:35.540 --> 02:02:36.540
I'm not mad at you.

02:02:36.540 --> 02:02:40.060
I'm just mad at partially mad at myself for letting it happen.

02:02:40.060 --> 02:02:41.540
I'm just kind of mad at Microsoft.

02:02:41.540 --> 02:02:43.540
This is ridiculous.

02:02:43.540 --> 02:02:44.540
Rawr.

02:02:44.540 --> 02:02:45.540
Rawr.

02:02:45.540 --> 02:02:46.540
What?

02:02:46.540 --> 02:02:47.540
Poor Rob.

02:02:47.540 --> 02:02:50.540
Can we move on to more news?

02:02:50.540 --> 02:02:51.540
Loki.

02:02:51.540 --> 02:02:53.540
All right.

02:02:53.540 --> 02:02:56.700
Um, so this is kind of cool.

02:02:56.700 --> 02:03:03.180
We're apparently going to be doing some new, I'm assuming it's just a port of Counter-Strike,

02:03:03.180 --> 02:03:06.860
but Valve is putting out Counter-Strike Global Offensive.

02:03:06.860 --> 02:03:12.820
It's coming to Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network, and Steam early next year.

02:03:12.820 --> 02:03:16.500
And of course it's going to have new maps, characters, and weapons.

02:03:16.500 --> 02:03:20.100
And some renovated classic maps as well.

02:03:20.100 --> 02:03:26.220
And new modes, matchmaking options, leaderboards, all the usual stuff that they have in shooters

02:03:26.220 --> 02:03:27.900
nowadays.

02:03:27.900 --> 02:03:33.140
And um, yeah, I mean that's kind of cool that they're actually putting out a new game.

02:03:33.140 --> 02:03:37.940
I mean everyone loves Valve games and I'm sure this one will be supported just as well

02:03:37.940 --> 02:03:39.900
as all the other stuff that they put out.

02:03:39.900 --> 02:03:44.260
And maybe they'll have hats someday.

02:03:44.260 --> 02:03:45.260
Yay hats.

02:03:45.260 --> 02:03:46.260
Hats.

02:03:46.260 --> 02:03:47.260
Yeah.

02:03:47.260 --> 02:03:54.260
Um, some other cool stuff, of course, they're going to have a new decoy grenade, which is

02:03:54.260 --> 02:03:55.260
kind of cool.

02:03:55.260 --> 02:04:01.300
And some other new animations and models and whatnot.

02:04:01.300 --> 02:04:06.580
There's going to be a new heavy machine gun, a new range of shotguns, specifically for

02:04:06.580 --> 02:04:16.580
close-up combat, Molotov cocktail grenades, and I guess some stuff for cutting off certain

02:04:16.580 --> 02:04:23.940
areas of the map, and then basically a decoy grenade, which it'll do is it'll send out

02:04:23.940 --> 02:04:28.580
a burst of gunfire from wherever it's thrown, so if you want to make someone think that

02:04:28.580 --> 02:04:32.540
you're in one place that you're not, then you can do that.

02:04:32.540 --> 02:04:40.980
And then, I guess they also have some other stuff that they're tweaking, gunfire for different

02:04:40.980 --> 02:04:43.220
weapons and stuff like that.

02:04:43.220 --> 02:04:50.140
Also they're going to have, I guess, different things where they're going to give everybody

02:04:50.140 --> 02:04:54.940
Kevlar the round start or making people have to defuse bombs and stuff like that.

02:04:54.940 --> 02:04:59.380
So it sounds like if you're trying to tweak up the gameplay and stuff like that, I don't

02:04:59.380 --> 02:05:03.620
know, it sounds good to me.

02:05:03.620 --> 02:05:05.420
Are you excited for a new Counter-Strike game?

02:05:05.420 --> 02:05:08.700
You know I owned the old one on Xbox, even though I am terrible at it.

02:05:08.700 --> 02:05:13.140
I think I maybe played online once, and I was so terrible I got screamed at and I just

02:05:13.140 --> 02:05:14.140
cried.

02:05:14.140 --> 02:05:20.100
You know, I've never really played the original, but I know it's definitely popular, so I mean,

02:05:20.100 --> 02:05:23.340
I don't know, this should do well.

02:05:23.340 --> 02:05:30.420
It's one of the first major military first-person shooter games that they had out there, so.

02:05:30.420 --> 02:05:31.540
I think it'll do well.

02:05:31.540 --> 02:05:34.340
So can I read a text message I just got from Xtopher?

02:05:34.340 --> 02:05:35.340
Do it!

02:05:35.340 --> 02:05:36.340
My co-host over on Hoard House.

02:05:36.340 --> 02:05:39.820
No, this is hilarious, here you go.

02:05:39.820 --> 02:05:45.060
Hey, I just thought you should know that, insert person's name redacted here, Xbox account

02:05:45.060 --> 02:05:48.980
and money got hacked a few weeks ago, just in case you're talking about it on the show

02:05:48.980 --> 02:05:49.980
tonight.

02:05:49.980 --> 02:05:51.780
That's person number five I know that's been hacked.

02:05:51.780 --> 02:05:53.780
I thought that was six.

02:05:53.780 --> 02:05:58.780
Whatever, it's a fucking lot of people that this is happening to.

02:05:58.780 --> 02:06:01.860
Nothing's going on at Microsoft, but Sony needs to provide free debics.

02:06:01.860 --> 02:06:04.420
I'm gonna have Dan check ours now.

02:06:04.420 --> 02:06:08.540
Seriously, I'm telling you guys, change your fucking passwords, like do it.

02:06:08.540 --> 02:06:12.140
Alright, anyhow, moving on.

02:06:12.140 --> 02:06:16.660
Other news, this is about Kingdom Hearts.

02:06:16.660 --> 02:06:21.460
No it's not news about Kingdom Hearts 3, sorry, but there is of course Kingdom Hearts 3D or

02:06:21.460 --> 02:06:24.380
Dream Drop Distance, get it?

02:06:24.380 --> 02:06:28.260
That is coming out I guess soon, you're gonna be getting a hands-on if you're going to the

02:06:28.260 --> 02:06:33.500
Tokyo Game Show in the fall, however what's also interesting in the Kingdom Hearts universe

02:06:33.500 --> 02:06:40.420
is in the latest issue of the Japanese magazine Dengeki PlayStation, Tetsuya Nomura actually

02:06:40.420 --> 02:06:45.100
said that it's becoming difficult to get new players into the series with each new iteration.

02:06:45.100 --> 02:06:50.900
Well, the plot's kind of complicated, I'm not too surprised at that, but what's also

02:06:50.900 --> 02:06:55.860
interesting about it, as a celebration of the franchise's 10th anniversary, he hopes

02:06:55.860 --> 02:07:00.060
to release an HD technical test of the series.

02:07:00.060 --> 02:07:01.060
What?

02:07:01.060 --> 02:07:05.940
Does that mean like a tech demo, like Final Fantasy 7?

02:07:05.940 --> 02:07:09.740
Does it mean remakes of the first game because you're talking about trying to get people

02:07:09.740 --> 02:07:10.740
into it?

02:07:10.740 --> 02:07:12.420
That would be awesome.

02:07:12.420 --> 02:07:17.220
Who knows, but perhaps there's more information at Tokyo Game Show next month.

02:07:17.220 --> 02:07:23.340
Don't tease me like that, that's terrible that they're teasing us so terribly with that.

02:07:23.340 --> 02:07:24.340
We'll see what happens.

02:07:24.340 --> 02:07:27.540
I don't know, Dark Soccer, do you think that Kingdom Hearts is a tough series for people

02:07:27.540 --> 02:07:28.540
to get into?

02:07:28.540 --> 02:07:29.540
I don't think so.

02:07:29.540 --> 02:07:35.180
Yeah, I don't think it's like, I mean, it is a weird plot, but it did always kind of

02:07:35.180 --> 02:07:40.660
fascinate me, Kingdom Hearts was sort of for kids, but not really, probably older kids

02:07:40.660 --> 02:07:41.660
definitely.

02:07:41.660 --> 02:07:45.740
Like a young kid would never understand that plot, I'm sorry.

02:07:45.740 --> 02:07:48.740
Why is Mickey wearing black and he has a sword?

02:07:48.740 --> 02:07:49.780
Really convoluted.

02:07:49.780 --> 02:07:52.780
But I think that's why people really love Kingdom Hearts, is that it is a little bit

02:07:52.780 --> 02:08:01.980
the darker side of Disney, which, you know, Epic Mickey sort of tried to do, but eh, so.

02:08:01.980 --> 02:08:07.620
And Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, you made a grammatical error.

02:08:07.620 --> 02:08:10.340
I'm sorry, what do I do now?

02:08:10.340 --> 02:08:11.780
Use an apostrophe for it.

02:08:11.780 --> 02:08:12.780
Oh my gosh.

02:08:12.780 --> 02:08:15.900
It's a radio show, nobody sees that.

02:08:15.900 --> 02:08:16.900
I do.

02:08:16.900 --> 02:08:21.260
Well, how about, well, how about I just use that to go ahead and get into my news then?

02:08:21.260 --> 02:08:22.260
Sure.

02:08:22.260 --> 02:08:23.260
Okay.

02:08:23.260 --> 02:08:27.900
Australia is getting an R18 plus rating, finally.

02:08:27.900 --> 02:08:30.700
Get with it, Australia.

02:08:30.700 --> 02:08:38.500
They actually have it added to their new rating system so that they can have mature games.

02:08:38.500 --> 02:08:39.500
It's about time.

02:08:39.500 --> 02:08:43.340
I'm just banning them outright, you know?

02:08:43.340 --> 02:08:46.700
So maybe Mortal Kombat will finally come out in Australia legitimately.

02:08:46.700 --> 02:08:47.700
Maybe.

02:08:47.700 --> 02:08:48.700
And some of the other games that have been banned there recently.

02:08:48.700 --> 02:08:53.700
But I mean, if you look at it from a financial point of view, putting the ratings out there

02:08:53.700 --> 02:08:56.980
and allowing these games to come out instead of banning them is revenue.

02:08:56.980 --> 02:08:58.580
That's going to be awesome.

02:08:58.580 --> 02:09:03.340
There's going to be an explosion of violent and graphic games in Australia really soon.

02:09:03.340 --> 02:09:04.340
Yeah.

02:09:04.340 --> 02:09:07.340
And kangaroos will run all over you and punch you in the face.

02:09:07.340 --> 02:09:10.360
They'll have a bunch of underrated editions come out.

02:09:10.360 --> 02:09:12.780
You know, it wasn't in the show world, but did you hear about the fuckery?

02:09:12.780 --> 02:09:16.620
I mean, I'm sure you heard about the fuckery that was going on in Britain this week with

02:09:16.620 --> 02:09:18.140
all the rioting and all that stuff.

02:09:18.140 --> 02:09:19.140
So awful.

02:09:19.140 --> 02:09:20.140
It's terrible.

02:09:20.140 --> 02:09:23.060
But the real fuckery I'm talking about is how people wanted to blame all that on Grand

02:09:23.060 --> 02:09:24.060
Theft Auto.

02:09:24.060 --> 02:09:26.140
Because, of course, you know, you got to blame it on something.

02:09:26.140 --> 02:09:28.540
You can't just blame it on fuckers being fuckers.

02:09:28.540 --> 02:09:29.540
Yeah.

02:09:29.540 --> 02:09:30.540
But it's really sad.

02:09:30.540 --> 02:09:33.220
When I first saw that on the TV, I was like, I hope they don't burn down Disneyland because

02:09:33.220 --> 02:09:34.220
I didn't realize it was Britain.

02:09:34.220 --> 02:09:39.260
I just instantly assumed it was L.A. And then when you hear it, you know, you hear him talking

02:09:39.260 --> 02:09:41.260
and you're like, what?

02:09:41.260 --> 02:09:46.780
Well, on top of that, there's trashy people everywhere, but I just, you know, you didn't

02:09:46.780 --> 02:09:48.940
think it would happen there in jolly old England.

02:09:48.940 --> 02:09:53.700
Did you did you see the thing I put on my Tumblr about the old man's barbershop?

02:09:53.700 --> 02:09:54.700
No.

02:09:54.700 --> 02:09:59.320
There was an elderly gentleman whose shop got ransacked and he had owned it with his

02:09:59.320 --> 02:10:04.320
wife and his wife passed away and they like completely tore up his barbershop.

02:10:04.320 --> 02:10:07.100
He'd had it for something like, I want to say, 40 years.

02:10:07.100 --> 02:10:08.140
How sad.

02:10:08.140 --> 02:10:09.140
And that he'd have to go out of business.

02:10:09.140 --> 02:10:14.860
But there's actually an online group going around raising money to to rebuild a store.

02:10:14.860 --> 02:10:17.260
If I can find it, I'll link it in the chat room.

02:10:17.260 --> 02:10:20.780
But I thought that was a nice touch.

02:10:20.780 --> 02:10:21.780
R.D.G.

02:10:21.780 --> 02:10:25.660
Singe in the chat is thrown back to something last week, but wants to ask Dark Soccer a

02:10:25.660 --> 02:10:27.580
question and I guess now's a good time.

02:10:27.580 --> 02:10:29.540
Any updates on the tester?

02:10:29.540 --> 02:10:30.540
Remember last week?

02:10:30.540 --> 02:10:31.540
Yeah.

02:10:31.540 --> 02:10:32.540
I've been upgraded to contestant.

02:10:32.540 --> 02:10:33.540
Really?

02:10:33.540 --> 02:10:34.540
Yeah.

02:10:34.540 --> 02:10:37.100
That means I have to do stupid video.

02:10:37.100 --> 02:10:40.500
But now I kind of I mean, there's part of me that doesn't want to because I don't want

02:10:40.500 --> 02:10:41.900
to be away from Dan.

02:10:41.900 --> 02:10:47.340
Oh, because when he was gone for five days and it made me sad, it's only going to be

02:10:47.340 --> 02:10:48.340
a few days.

02:10:48.340 --> 02:10:51.780
And I don't think I don't think it's like Survivor where you can't like call people.

02:10:51.780 --> 02:10:54.340
I think they I think they'd let you talk to your family and stuff.

02:10:54.340 --> 02:10:56.020
Well, I'm sure they do.

02:10:56.020 --> 02:10:58.740
But I mean, I don't like L.A. either.

02:10:58.740 --> 02:11:01.780
I just I just feel like we're done taping by.

02:11:01.780 --> 02:11:03.780
I'm going to Disneyland.

02:11:03.780 --> 02:11:05.980
I just hang out with Marissa all the time.

02:11:05.980 --> 02:11:07.400
You'd be with other nerds.

02:11:07.400 --> 02:11:09.620
I mean, of course, they're purposely going to cast people.

02:11:09.620 --> 02:11:11.460
They're going to drive you bonkers.

02:11:11.460 --> 02:11:16.020
But you know, if you don't kill them, you might get a job and a couple thousand dollars.

02:11:16.020 --> 02:11:17.020
Maybe so.

02:11:17.020 --> 02:11:20.220
But yeah, I got my account upgrade a few days ago.

02:11:20.220 --> 02:11:21.220
Woo hoo.

02:11:21.220 --> 02:11:22.220
I guess.

02:11:22.220 --> 02:11:23.220
So now you're in.

02:11:23.220 --> 02:11:25.460
You are an official contestant of tester season three.

02:11:25.460 --> 02:11:26.460
Yes.

02:11:26.460 --> 02:11:27.460
Bothers me.

02:11:27.460 --> 02:11:28.460
I don't know why I'm so bothered by this.

02:11:28.460 --> 02:11:29.460
All right.

02:11:29.460 --> 02:11:33.540
Anyhow, Loki, we got a couple more news stories for you guys that we're going to open up the

02:11:33.540 --> 02:11:34.540
Skype line.

02:11:34.540 --> 02:11:36.340
Folks, I need to put this out here.

02:11:36.340 --> 02:11:39.220
The eight hundred number is not working tonight.

02:11:39.220 --> 02:11:42.620
So you can only Skype us tonight at Orange Lounge Radio.

02:11:42.620 --> 02:11:44.180
The problem is temporary.

02:11:44.180 --> 02:11:45.660
It'll hopefully be fixed by next week.

02:11:45.660 --> 02:11:49.520
But just a heads up, you can only Skype us tonight at Orange Lounge Radio.

02:11:49.520 --> 02:11:52.820
So the eight seven seven number again, not working tonight.

02:11:52.820 --> 02:11:53.900
Please don't use it.

02:11:53.900 --> 02:11:55.380
Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.

02:11:55.380 --> 02:11:57.340
But first, a couple more stories for you guys.

02:11:57.340 --> 02:12:05.300
Now normally you don't hear of some wild successes on Xbox Live Indie games, but there is one.

02:12:05.300 --> 02:12:09.820
And this should come no surprise, seeing as it's kind of a clone of another game.

02:12:09.820 --> 02:12:17.060
Fortress Craft, the kind of Minecraft knockoff, has sold three hundred and fifty thousand

02:12:17.060 --> 02:12:22.980
copies and brought in over a million dollars.

02:12:22.980 --> 02:12:26.980
And they said, of course, no, it's not really like Minecraft.

02:12:26.980 --> 02:12:29.180
It's more of like Dwarf Fortress.

02:12:29.180 --> 02:12:31.180
But it's Minecraft.

02:12:31.180 --> 02:12:32.180
OK.

02:12:32.180 --> 02:12:34.260
I mean, it looks like goddamn Minecraft.

02:12:34.260 --> 02:12:40.340
So it is the probably the best selling, I would imagine the best selling game on Xbox

02:12:40.340 --> 02:12:43.060
Live Indie games is making a million dollars.

02:12:43.060 --> 02:12:45.660
Yeah, that's pretty good.

02:12:45.660 --> 02:12:50.820
So apparently there is an eighty four percent trial to purchase conversion rate, which pretty

02:12:50.820 --> 02:12:54.700
impressive, if you ask me.

02:12:54.700 --> 02:13:00.540
Four hundred thousand eight hundred twenty three copies sold.

02:13:00.540 --> 02:13:03.660
And they have like a bunch of different statistics.

02:13:03.660 --> 02:13:06.420
It's funny in there.

02:13:06.420 --> 02:13:11.260
Ninety six million one hundred ninety seven thousand five hundred twenty Microsoft points

02:13:11.260 --> 02:13:13.660
spent on the game.

02:13:13.660 --> 02:13:18.100
Most of the purchases being in the US, followed by Great Britain and Canada.

02:13:18.100 --> 02:13:25.020
And yeah, so I guess that's a good news for Minecraft when it comes out of here.

02:13:25.020 --> 02:13:26.540
Looks like people want it.

02:13:26.540 --> 02:13:29.740
All right, good money.

02:13:29.740 --> 02:13:30.740
Good thing.

02:13:30.740 --> 02:13:31.740
All right.

02:13:31.740 --> 02:13:36.500
Anyhow, the one more story for you guys, then we're going to open up the Skype line at Orange

02:13:36.500 --> 02:13:42.180
Lounge Radio on Skype, and this has to do with the game Rage that's going to be coming

02:13:42.180 --> 02:13:43.700
out fairly soon.

02:13:43.700 --> 02:13:48.060
Of course, this is a new FPS franchise that's coming out.

02:13:48.060 --> 02:13:53.060
But Tim Wiltis, who is the ID software creative director, of course, ID software is putting

02:13:53.060 --> 02:13:54.380
out this game.

02:13:54.380 --> 02:13:59.540
He says that the access to the game's underground will be restricted to those who get their

02:13:59.540 --> 02:14:04.140
copy new at retail, excuse me, new at retail.

02:14:04.140 --> 02:14:06.900
He's saying you've played Rage five times.

02:14:06.900 --> 02:14:09.260
Have you ever found any sewer hatches?

02:14:09.260 --> 02:14:12.620
If you bought the game new, that would be open for you.

02:14:12.620 --> 02:14:15.700
So he says you still have to download it, but you don't have to pay for it.

02:14:15.700 --> 02:14:17.340
Those hatches are all over.

02:14:17.340 --> 02:14:20.980
Most people never find them, but as soon as you do, you're like, oh, and then you start

02:14:20.980 --> 02:14:21.980
to look for it.

02:14:21.980 --> 02:14:23.880
That's our first time buyer incentive.

02:14:23.880 --> 02:14:27.180
So instead of doing an online pass or whatever a lot of companies are doing, I guess there's

02:14:27.180 --> 02:14:32.180
these new little zone, for lack of a better word, that you can explore, but only if you

02:14:32.180 --> 02:14:35.140
are a new game owner.

02:14:35.140 --> 02:14:39.580
Otherwise, you may never notice it's there, I guess, because it's all in the sewer.

02:14:39.580 --> 02:14:43.180
And from what I understand, none of the main storyline happens in the sewer.

02:14:43.180 --> 02:14:45.540
I guess this is all like side quests.

02:14:45.540 --> 02:14:51.180
So it's basically additional content that's only available when you buy it new.

02:14:51.180 --> 02:14:56.460
No, no, it's not additional content, because if it's already on the disk and you're just

02:14:56.460 --> 02:14:59.260
unlocking access to it, then it's not additional.

02:14:59.260 --> 02:15:03.080
Now if it's some download content, then that's a little different.

02:15:03.080 --> 02:15:06.140
But I have a feeling this is crap that's already on the disk.

02:15:06.140 --> 02:15:12.260
They're just allowing you access to it, which is kind of lame.

02:15:12.260 --> 02:15:14.980
So all right, well, we're going to go ahead and open up the Skype line.

02:15:14.980 --> 02:15:17.140
We are Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.

02:15:17.140 --> 02:15:19.380
You can go ahead and give us a call on Skype.

02:15:19.380 --> 02:15:25.940
In the meantime, we're going to check the Twitter and go to some Twitter topics.

02:15:25.940 --> 02:15:30.460
I'm going to the Twitter right now, twitter.com, of course, slash O-L-R if you want to send

02:15:30.460 --> 02:15:32.340
us some tweets.

02:15:32.340 --> 02:15:41.100
Meanwhile, let's go on to some tweets, starting off with Flaco Jones, who I guess must be

02:15:41.100 --> 02:15:46.820
listening live tonight, because he's tweeting us and saying, LulzSec announced in mid-June

02:15:46.820 --> 02:15:51.860
that they released Xbox Live account information, and Microsoft did nothing.

02:15:51.860 --> 02:15:55.060
No, it wasn't Xbox Live account information.

02:15:55.060 --> 02:16:05.780
It was some other service that people had emails for and stuff, and they basically said,

02:16:05.780 --> 02:16:13.220
go try those email password combinations in Xbox Live, Facebook, et cetera, because a

02:16:13.220 --> 02:16:16.740
lot of people don't change their passwords and they use the same combination all over

02:16:16.740 --> 02:16:17.740
the place.

02:16:17.740 --> 02:16:18.740
But I do change my passwords.

02:16:18.740 --> 02:16:19.740
Exactly.

02:16:19.740 --> 02:16:20.740
Sums up.

02:16:20.740 --> 02:16:21.740
No, they didn't hack Xbox Live.

02:16:21.740 --> 02:16:22.740
Interesting.

02:16:22.740 --> 02:16:26.740
Yeah, and it does say that the story is appended with an update that says, Microsoft released

02:16:26.740 --> 02:16:31.180
a statement that Xbox Live was not compromised to the best of Microsoft's knowledge, and

02:16:31.180 --> 02:16:35.500
the logins passwords were released at random with people encouraged to try the information

02:16:35.500 --> 02:16:37.740
on services like Xbox Live.

02:16:37.740 --> 02:16:39.060
And I do remember that happening.

02:16:39.060 --> 02:16:43.540
I do remember when they released a big list of login and passwords and all that stuff.

02:16:43.540 --> 02:16:45.220
All right.

02:16:45.220 --> 02:16:50.100
Also, Flaco Jones in the tweet says to us, maybe if Microsoft took Xbox Live down for

02:16:50.100 --> 02:16:54.060
a month, when they most likely knew account info had been compromised, no money would

02:16:54.060 --> 02:16:55.860
have been stolen.

02:16:55.860 --> 02:16:57.940
Kind of like I guess Sony did.

02:16:57.940 --> 02:16:58.940
Interesting.

02:16:58.940 --> 02:17:04.460
Going to another tweet here from Nico Nico Chan tweets us saying, I heard from a friend

02:17:04.460 --> 02:17:06.980
that Dark Sakura likes Para Para.

02:17:06.980 --> 02:17:12.100
I was wondering what Para Para dancer she watched on YouTube, if she does.

02:17:12.100 --> 02:17:13.740
I just watch whatever I find.

02:17:13.740 --> 02:17:14.900
You just kind of YouTuber.

02:17:14.900 --> 02:17:16.700
It's more of the songs for you, isn't it?

02:17:16.700 --> 02:17:17.700
Well, yeah.

02:17:17.700 --> 02:17:19.060
I mean, there's certain dances that I like.

02:17:19.060 --> 02:17:23.780
I like the one for Velfar and I like, there's a number of them that I like, but I'll find

02:17:23.780 --> 02:17:27.760
like different groups and see different people doing them.

02:17:27.760 --> 02:17:31.420
How can you best, for those that don't know what Para Para is, how can you best describe

02:17:31.420 --> 02:17:32.420
it to people?

02:17:32.420 --> 02:17:34.340
Cheerleading in line dancing.

02:17:34.340 --> 02:17:36.900
Cheerleading in line dancing combined.

02:17:36.900 --> 02:17:40.140
How would you classify the music?

02:17:40.140 --> 02:17:41.380
Synthy.

02:17:41.380 --> 02:17:45.580
Let me let me play you an example of a song from Para Para paradise just in case you've

02:17:45.580 --> 02:17:46.580
never heard.

02:17:46.580 --> 02:17:47.580
So imagine doing like...

02:17:47.580 --> 02:17:48.580
Play Velfar if you haven't.

02:17:48.580 --> 02:17:49.580
Cheer...

02:17:49.580 --> 02:17:50.580
I didn't have that one ready.

02:17:50.580 --> 02:17:51.580
Sorry.

02:17:51.580 --> 02:17:52.580
This is like cheer dancing.

02:17:52.580 --> 02:17:53.580
Here you go.

02:17:53.580 --> 02:18:00.580
Jamie is actually waving her hands in the studio.

02:18:00.580 --> 02:18:12.820
This is one that I used to know.

02:18:12.820 --> 02:18:15.780
The only one I knew for a short time was what was it called?

02:18:15.780 --> 02:18:18.060
Sexy, sexy, sexy, where you shake your butt.

02:18:18.060 --> 02:18:19.060
That was always my favorite.

02:18:19.060 --> 02:18:20.500
You need deluxe.

02:18:20.500 --> 02:18:21.500
I did.

02:18:21.500 --> 02:18:22.500
That was, that was it.

02:18:22.500 --> 02:18:23.500
Deluxe.

02:18:23.500 --> 02:18:24.500
And you knew like a virgin.

02:18:24.500 --> 02:18:27.140
I taught, I spent a whole night learning the like a virgin dance.

02:18:27.140 --> 02:18:28.140
And you taught it to me.

02:18:28.140 --> 02:18:29.540
That's not the Madonna like a virgin.

02:18:29.540 --> 02:18:31.860
That's a whole different one.

02:18:31.860 --> 02:18:35.180
And you're going to make me sound like even gayer dark soccer.

02:18:35.180 --> 02:18:37.740
Oh Rob, that's not possible.

02:18:37.740 --> 02:18:39.100
Shut up.

02:18:39.100 --> 02:18:40.100
Heart.

02:18:40.100 --> 02:18:43.340
I'm trying to find like a virgin because it has the funniest intro ever.

02:18:43.340 --> 02:18:44.340
Hold on.

02:18:44.340 --> 02:18:46.640
I got to find it.

02:18:46.640 --> 02:18:48.540
Do you miss the Para Para machine that was here locally?

02:18:48.540 --> 02:18:49.540
Yes, I do.

02:18:49.540 --> 02:18:51.020
I know you said something about that.

02:18:51.020 --> 02:18:54.060
And someone's supposed to lend me dance master so I can do night of fire.

02:18:54.060 --> 02:18:55.060
Thank you for that.

02:18:55.060 --> 02:18:56.480
You know night of fire.

02:18:56.480 --> 02:18:59.260
I do now thanks to dance masters.

02:18:59.260 --> 02:19:00.260
So where is it?

02:19:00.260 --> 02:19:01.260
I can't.

02:19:01.260 --> 02:19:02.260
Argh.

02:19:02.260 --> 02:19:03.260
Hold on.

02:19:03.260 --> 02:19:05.260
I got one of their directory.

02:19:05.260 --> 02:19:06.260
I got to check.

02:19:06.260 --> 02:19:07.260
This is an alternative reality game.

02:19:07.260 --> 02:19:08.260
This is awesome live radio.

02:19:08.260 --> 02:19:09.260
But hold on.

02:19:09.260 --> 02:19:11.580
I got to check one more folder here.

02:19:11.580 --> 02:19:12.580
I used to...

02:19:12.580 --> 02:19:13.580
Hurry up.

02:19:13.580 --> 02:19:14.580
We got Pinkberry.

02:19:14.580 --> 02:19:21.580
I used to have the entirety of DDR Freaks radio's rotation here on the computer and

02:19:21.580 --> 02:19:26.220
I'm pretty sure they had it in their rotation.

02:19:26.220 --> 02:19:27.220
Here it is.

02:19:27.220 --> 02:19:28.220
Okay.

02:19:28.220 --> 02:19:29.220
Hilarious opening.

02:19:29.220 --> 02:19:31.580
And the band, of course, is called Virgin Elle.

02:19:31.580 --> 02:19:32.580
So here you go.

02:19:32.580 --> 02:19:36.580
It's a little bit sexy, right?

02:19:36.580 --> 02:19:37.580
Yeah.

02:19:37.580 --> 02:19:38.580
Maybe not.

02:19:38.580 --> 02:19:52.700
Zethurin Chat says, when I dance to Eurobeat, I pretend to drive a car really fast down

02:19:52.700 --> 02:19:56.540
a mountain pass, shifting the gears of my hands and the steering wheel movements.

02:19:56.540 --> 02:19:58.180
This is not Initial D.

02:19:58.180 --> 02:19:59.180
I'm sorry.

02:19:59.180 --> 02:20:00.180
It is Initial D.

02:20:00.180 --> 02:20:09.980
Initial D. Initial D. But most of these performers, by the way, the bands are out of Italy.

02:20:09.980 --> 02:20:10.980
Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.

02:20:10.980 --> 02:20:14.020
Again, the Skype line is open, guys.

02:20:14.020 --> 02:20:16.620
Going to Tiger Claw since it's a couple tweets here.

02:20:16.620 --> 02:20:21.940
One of them has to do with Nintendo looking at trademark applications for Wii U in the

02:20:21.940 --> 02:20:22.940
US.

02:20:22.940 --> 02:20:26.860
Now, this is not just, I think, what Dark Soccer was talking about earlier, but some

02:20:26.860 --> 02:20:32.820
other related things, such as point cards, advertising and publicity services for providing

02:20:32.820 --> 02:20:33.820
information.

02:20:33.820 --> 02:20:39.300
Let's see, telecommunication via electronic bulletin boards, providing images via communication

02:20:39.300 --> 02:20:44.940
with handheld game devices, clothing for domestic pets, bags and the like, and so forth.

02:20:44.940 --> 02:20:45.940
Oh, God.

02:20:45.940 --> 02:20:47.180
You know what game that is.

02:20:47.180 --> 02:20:50.300
Clothing, waistbands, belts for clothing, so forth.

02:20:50.300 --> 02:20:57.420
Card games, notebooks, consumer video game machines fitted with a camera function.

02:20:57.420 --> 02:20:58.780
Meaning I guess the camera's already built in.

02:20:58.780 --> 02:21:00.780
Interesting.

02:21:00.780 --> 02:21:02.420
IDK.

02:21:02.420 --> 02:21:04.500
All right.

02:21:04.500 --> 02:21:06.220
Also Tiger Claw tweets us another tweet.

02:21:06.220 --> 02:21:09.980
Sony wants to know what PlayStation Vita peripherals you want.

02:21:09.980 --> 02:21:12.960
What do you want to see on the Vita?

02:21:12.960 --> 02:21:16.540
So I guess some of the responses that are showing up on this poll so far.

02:21:16.540 --> 02:21:19.220
It's on the Japanese PlayStation Vita community site.

02:21:19.220 --> 02:21:27.460
A UMD drive, a cradle with HDMI out, a compact full keyboard, a grip adapter with a secondary

02:21:27.460 --> 02:21:28.780
battery built in.

02:21:28.780 --> 02:21:31.460
UMD drive is by far the most popular response so far.

02:21:31.460 --> 02:21:34.380
How about a USB connector?

02:21:34.380 --> 02:21:36.660
That might be already there.

02:21:36.660 --> 02:21:37.660
I think.

02:21:37.660 --> 02:21:38.660
Yeah.

02:21:38.660 --> 02:21:39.660
That's low keys.

02:21:39.660 --> 02:21:40.940
Confirm me that it's already there.

02:21:40.940 --> 02:21:41.940
Again.

02:21:41.940 --> 02:21:42.940
Orange, Ontario on Skype.

02:21:42.940 --> 02:21:46.380
If you want to give us a call tonight, I have one of this pay point things where, you know,

02:21:46.380 --> 02:21:49.660
you put your card up to the sensor and it charges you.

02:21:49.660 --> 02:21:51.420
Here, I don't have to enter anything.

02:21:51.420 --> 02:21:52.700
I'll just buy all of this.

02:21:52.700 --> 02:21:56.220
Dark Tetsuya says, we should totally start B's for Xenoblade.

02:21:56.220 --> 02:21:57.220
It's a hashtag.

02:21:57.220 --> 02:21:58.220
Just saying.

02:21:58.220 --> 02:21:59.220
If you want.

02:21:59.220 --> 02:22:01.500
Maybe it'll catch on like President Cat.

02:22:01.500 --> 02:22:03.580
You can do it.

02:22:03.580 --> 02:22:04.580
I don't know.

02:22:04.580 --> 02:22:05.580
Go for it.

02:22:05.580 --> 02:22:07.420
If you think it should be done, you should start that.

02:22:07.420 --> 02:22:10.180
I will endorse B's for Xenoblade.

02:22:10.180 --> 02:22:11.180
There you go.

02:22:11.180 --> 02:22:12.180
All right.

02:22:12.180 --> 02:22:13.180
We got a call coming in.

02:22:13.180 --> 02:22:14.460
Let's go to the phones and take the call.

02:22:14.460 --> 02:22:15.460
Hi.

02:22:15.460 --> 02:22:16.460
You're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:22:16.460 --> 02:22:17.460
Who's this?

02:22:17.460 --> 02:22:18.460
Hello?

02:22:18.460 --> 02:22:19.460
Hi.

02:22:19.460 --> 02:22:20.460
You're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:22:20.460 --> 02:22:21.460
Who's this?

02:22:21.460 --> 02:22:22.460
Uh, the word Nate again.

02:22:22.460 --> 02:22:23.460
Hey, what's up, Nate?

02:22:23.460 --> 02:22:24.460
Yeah, dude.

02:22:24.460 --> 02:22:27.820
I was calling, um, about, about, uh, the indie thing.

02:22:27.820 --> 02:22:28.820
The indie gaming.

02:22:28.820 --> 02:22:29.820
Yes.

02:22:29.820 --> 02:22:31.980
Um, I'm an indie game developer.

02:22:31.980 --> 02:22:34.460
You are an indie game developer yourself.

02:22:34.460 --> 02:22:35.460
Yeah.

02:22:35.460 --> 02:22:37.460
What games are you developing?

02:22:37.460 --> 02:22:39.780
Now, don't, don't laugh at me now.

02:22:39.780 --> 02:22:41.900
I'm making a farming game.

02:22:41.900 --> 02:22:42.900
You're making a-

02:22:42.900 --> 02:22:43.900
Right now.

02:22:43.900 --> 02:22:44.900
Oh, God.

02:22:44.900 --> 02:22:45.900
You're making a farming game.

02:22:45.900 --> 02:22:46.900
But hold on.

02:22:46.900 --> 02:22:47.900
It's not like Farmville.

02:22:47.900 --> 02:22:48.900
Okay.

02:22:48.900 --> 02:22:51.940
It's more, it's more like Monopoly mixed with, uh, Harvest Moon.

02:22:51.940 --> 02:22:52.940
Okay.

02:22:52.940 --> 02:22:56.940
Now, people like Harvest Moon, so, okay, and Monopoly, Monopoly is a fun game.

02:22:56.940 --> 02:23:02.880
I read the most weird news story ever this week that was talking about how in Monopoly,

02:23:02.880 --> 02:23:05.100
you actually don't want to own Boardwalk.

02:23:05.100 --> 02:23:07.580
You want to own Illinois Avenue.

02:23:07.580 --> 02:23:08.580
Just throwing it out there.

02:23:08.580 --> 02:23:10.900
Yeah, I saw an article too, but, um, I didn't read it.

02:23:10.900 --> 02:23:13.980
I just saw, I just saw it and I said, huh, these people don't know what they're talking

02:23:13.980 --> 02:23:14.980
about.

02:23:14.980 --> 02:23:16.600
And I just, I didn't read the article.

02:23:16.600 --> 02:23:18.100
So the game's not out yet then.

02:23:18.100 --> 02:23:21.540
You don't have anything to plug just yet, but I guess, and I don't know if you want

02:23:21.540 --> 02:23:25.780
to give away all the secrets, but how do you combine the worlds of Monopoly and Harvest

02:23:25.780 --> 02:23:26.780
Moon?

02:23:26.780 --> 02:23:32.820
Well, and again, you, you really, um, okay, you're trying to start a, a farming monopoly.

02:23:32.820 --> 02:23:37.580
So you start off as a small farmer and then later down the road, you just, you just, uh,

02:23:37.580 --> 02:23:42.860
you just get opportunities to take over other people's farms and, um, uh, get new property.

02:23:42.860 --> 02:23:45.100
You get to get the government to help you out.

02:23:45.100 --> 02:23:46.100
And it's a lot of crazy.

02:23:46.100 --> 02:23:50.020
Like we get to take over people's farms with guns.

02:23:50.020 --> 02:23:51.860
No you get to put them out of business.

02:23:51.860 --> 02:23:55.580
You're producing government supported crops.

02:23:55.580 --> 02:23:57.900
You're encouraging people to grow government cheese.

02:23:57.900 --> 02:24:01.380
Well, it's good, isn't it?

02:24:01.380 --> 02:24:07.520
Well yeah, but you know, your game's probably going to get like targeted by the organic

02:24:07.520 --> 02:24:14.660
growers of America or something, and you know, especially the Slow Food International and

02:24:14.660 --> 02:24:15.660
the Tea Party.

02:24:15.660 --> 02:24:18.300
No, the Tea Party is all down for that.

02:24:18.300 --> 02:24:19.820
They don't care about organic food.

02:24:19.820 --> 02:24:24.340
I'm going to say that crops are organic in the game, even though they aren't.

02:24:24.340 --> 02:24:30.300
If you have organic ones, then you need to have them cost more.

02:24:30.300 --> 02:24:31.300
Yeah.

02:24:31.300 --> 02:24:37.620
And then it'll get bad quicker and it tastes worse, but, um, whatever.

02:24:37.620 --> 02:24:38.620
All right.

02:24:38.620 --> 02:24:39.900
Well, let me, let me ask you this.

02:24:39.900 --> 02:24:42.540
Where did you get the idea to develop a game like this?

02:24:42.540 --> 02:24:43.540
Like what inspired you?

02:24:43.540 --> 02:24:47.380
Because, you know, people got to remember, you don't write an indie game in one night.

02:24:47.380 --> 02:24:51.580
I mean, I guess you can, but that's, you know, most of them definitely are not done in one

02:24:51.580 --> 02:24:52.580
night.

02:24:52.580 --> 02:24:54.260
They take a long time to develop.

02:24:54.260 --> 02:24:56.080
So you really have to be committed to your idea.

02:24:56.080 --> 02:25:02.540
So where did you get the idea that I want to do a farming game that's not FarmVille,

02:25:02.540 --> 02:25:05.780
that I will say, I want to do a farming game that's cool.

02:25:05.780 --> 02:25:07.140
Where did you kind of get that idea?

02:25:07.140 --> 02:25:13.140
Well, um, it was just random thoughts during the day and I kind of got down to never cause

02:25:13.140 --> 02:25:17.020
it started off with just three people farming on a farm.

02:25:17.020 --> 02:25:21.980
And then I thought they should, uh, they should make money and they should, uh, they should

02:25:21.980 --> 02:25:25.400
have, um, enemies and they should kill wolves and stuff too.

02:25:25.400 --> 02:25:29.820
So I was thinking about keep a spin on the enemy concept and to, well, they should have

02:25:29.820 --> 02:25:32.340
a huge mission to be like the best farmers in the world.

02:25:32.340 --> 02:25:33.340
Oh, cool.

02:25:33.340 --> 02:25:35.860
So your game does have violence in it.

02:25:35.860 --> 02:25:36.860
Of course.

02:25:36.860 --> 02:25:37.860
I'm on board.

02:25:37.860 --> 02:25:40.580
You get to hit wolves, not people, you don't, you don't steal people farm.

02:25:40.580 --> 02:25:46.460
You just, you just, you just make them sell out to you by selling your crops for less

02:25:46.460 --> 02:25:49.500
money than no more purpose, you know, like the Walmart model.

02:25:49.500 --> 02:25:50.780
So what are you developing for?

02:25:50.780 --> 02:25:53.620
Are you developing for Facebook or iOS or what?

02:25:53.620 --> 02:25:59.100
No, it's going to be for the big three, uh, that's not LeBron James, it's going to be

02:25:59.100 --> 02:26:02.340
for, uh, Mac, Windows and Linux.

02:26:02.340 --> 02:26:03.340
Ah, okay.

02:26:03.340 --> 02:26:07.140
So you're going for not, not the big three consoles, but the big three computers.

02:26:07.140 --> 02:26:08.140
All right.

02:26:08.140 --> 02:26:09.140
I'm down Mac, PC, Linux.

02:26:09.140 --> 02:26:13.780
Maybe you will be in the next humble indie bundle.

02:26:13.780 --> 02:26:14.780
I hope so.

02:26:14.780 --> 02:26:20.660
But you know, I need to keep developing, especially the graphics because, um, I don't have, I

02:26:20.660 --> 02:26:21.660
don't have much background.

02:26:21.660 --> 02:26:24.660
So I just have like skies and trees in the background.

02:26:24.660 --> 02:26:25.660
All right.

02:26:25.660 --> 02:26:27.380
So where's a website we can keep tabs on your progress.

02:26:27.380 --> 02:26:31.220
You have like a blog or something, or at least a Twitter where we can keep tabs on your progress.

02:26:31.220 --> 02:26:34.980
I want to type it on the chat so you can like see it.

02:26:34.980 --> 02:26:35.980
All right.

02:26:35.980 --> 02:26:36.980
It's tailware.com.

02:26:36.980 --> 02:26:37.980
Okay.

02:26:37.980 --> 02:26:38.980
Tailware.com.

02:26:38.980 --> 02:26:40.980
I'll look for that in the chat room.

02:26:40.980 --> 02:26:41.980
Yeah.

02:26:41.980 --> 02:26:47.380
So on the site it's other crap on there, but, um, uh,

02:26:47.380 --> 02:26:50.260
But it'll get better as the game gets further along.

02:26:50.260 --> 02:26:55.740
It's, it's a huge, it's a really bad demo up already, but that's like a, a really, really

02:26:55.740 --> 02:26:57.620
old and bad demo up.

02:26:57.620 --> 02:26:59.140
It's uh, it feels so fresh.

02:26:59.140 --> 02:27:00.140
I'll give you the link.

02:27:00.140 --> 02:27:01.140
All right.

02:27:01.140 --> 02:27:04.540
Well, when you get your game finished and you're ready to get it out there, you got

02:27:04.540 --> 02:27:06.260
to come back on the show and tell us more about it.

02:27:06.260 --> 02:27:09.380
I want you to give away all your ideas yet cause you're still developing it, but you

02:27:09.380 --> 02:27:12.980
got to come back on the show, uh, maybe one of your co-developers and talk a little more

02:27:12.980 --> 02:27:13.980
about it.

02:27:13.980 --> 02:27:18.660
Yeah, most definitely, you know, and then we can, um, smurf it up.

02:27:18.660 --> 02:27:19.660
All right.

02:27:19.660 --> 02:27:20.660
All right.

02:27:20.660 --> 02:27:21.660
All right.

02:27:21.660 --> 02:27:25.900
I'm going to let you go so we get more calls, but thanks for the call.

02:27:25.900 --> 02:27:26.900
All right.

02:27:26.900 --> 02:27:27.900
Take care, buddy.

02:27:27.900 --> 02:27:28.900
Bye.

02:27:28.900 --> 02:27:29.900
All right.

02:27:29.900 --> 02:27:30.900
Uh, orange lounge radio on Skype.

02:27:30.900 --> 02:27:33.860
If you want to call us again tonight, the 800 number does not work.

02:27:33.860 --> 02:27:35.660
No, we didn't forget to pay the bill.

02:27:35.660 --> 02:27:39.820
Uh, there's some other issues going on, so we will, uh, be back with that next week,

02:27:39.820 --> 02:27:40.820
but orange laundry on Skype.

02:27:40.820 --> 02:27:48.420
If you want to give us a call, um, moving on to more tweets, uh, Osford tweeted us saying,

02:27:48.420 --> 02:27:49.420
hi guys.

02:27:49.420 --> 02:27:51.420
Who's in Disney world?

02:27:51.420 --> 02:27:52.420
You suck.

02:27:52.420 --> 02:27:53.420
Your mom.

02:27:53.420 --> 02:27:54.420
You suck.

02:27:54.420 --> 02:27:59.100
SGA 100 Matt tweets us saying July, 2011 was apparently the worst month for the video game

02:27:59.100 --> 02:28:00.980
industry in almost five years.

02:28:00.980 --> 02:28:01.980
Yeah.

02:28:01.980 --> 02:28:05.900
I read this story too, and it has a lot of people going, oh shit, the video game industry

02:28:05.900 --> 02:28:06.900
is in trouble.

02:28:06.900 --> 02:28:12.740
But I'm like, well, what games came out in July, 2011 Catherine, when Catherine is your

02:28:12.740 --> 02:28:17.260
biggest release, like all month, like, I'm sorry, no disrespect to Catherine, but it's

02:28:17.260 --> 02:28:22.100
not exactly a triple-a or disrespect to earth defense force, insect Armageddon, or well,

02:28:22.100 --> 02:28:26.700
sorry, and apparently that's millions of copies either.

02:28:26.700 --> 02:28:31.600
So I mean, it should though, you just don't have huge, huge titles right now.

02:28:31.600 --> 02:28:37.140
And the biggest system is the Wii, which has literally fucking nothing on it, but the goddamn

02:28:37.140 --> 02:28:38.140
puppy bowl.

02:28:38.140 --> 02:28:39.140
No.

02:28:39.140 --> 02:28:46.900
Now in July, they had just dance summer party, which was all the DLC for Justin and Smurf

02:28:46.900 --> 02:28:53.660
stance party, excuse me.

02:28:53.660 --> 02:28:58.940
Like I said, uh, it's no surprise that I demand an explanation for these shenanigans.

02:28:58.940 --> 02:29:03.820
Plus the 3DS really doesn't have a lot going for it right now, nor does the PSP.

02:29:03.820 --> 02:29:06.380
We're kind of in between a lot of consoles right now.

02:29:06.380 --> 02:29:10.820
I mean, granted the 360 and PS3, you're still kind of at their prime, but they've those

02:29:10.820 --> 02:29:15.500
systems don't have fucking anything until the holidays, except Catherine.

02:29:15.500 --> 02:29:22.300
All right, anyhow, moving on to MNZeba tweets us saying, I downloaded juke beat.

02:29:22.300 --> 02:29:25.380
The Contra song on extreme is hilarious.

02:29:25.380 --> 02:29:27.340
How are you supposed to beat that?

02:29:27.340 --> 02:29:28.700
You literally have to memorize it.

02:29:28.700 --> 02:29:32.720
You're going to have to memorize where all those little fuckers show up and know exactly

02:29:32.720 --> 02:29:33.720
where to tap.

02:29:33.720 --> 02:29:34.720
Have you tried a song on expert yet?

02:29:34.720 --> 02:29:35.780
Loki, just take your Aussie.

02:29:35.780 --> 02:29:36.860
I haven't even tried.

02:29:36.860 --> 02:29:39.940
I'm sure it's pretty hilarious.

02:29:39.940 --> 02:29:43.740
Again, our username on Skype is orange lounge radio.

02:29:43.740 --> 02:29:50.220
Zither tweets us saying, Loki could learn from reason number one on this five crucial

02:29:50.220 --> 02:29:53.900
lessons learned by watching kids play video games.

02:29:53.900 --> 02:29:56.180
And I guess Loki, you could learn from number one.

02:29:56.180 --> 02:29:59.580
Well, let's, let's recap, but this is a cracked article.

02:29:59.580 --> 02:30:00.800
All cracked at this website.

02:30:00.800 --> 02:30:02.560
All they do are like top 10 lists, huh?

02:30:02.560 --> 02:30:06.020
Like every time I get linked to some top 10 lists, it's all fucking cracked.

02:30:06.020 --> 02:30:13.580
Like they've made a website out of top lists, not top lists, but top lists.

02:30:13.580 --> 02:30:14.580
It's kind of interesting.

02:30:14.580 --> 02:30:20.180
I don't know, uh, five crucial, crucial lessons learned by watching kids play video games.

02:30:20.180 --> 02:30:23.200
Number five, they don't tolerate losing.

02:30:23.200 --> 02:30:26.900
So modern games just let them win.

02:30:26.900 --> 02:30:27.900
They don't tolerate losing.

02:30:27.900 --> 02:30:31.300
So modern games just handed to them.

02:30:31.300 --> 02:30:36.380
Number four, they have no tolerance for grinding, you know, like in an old school final fantasy

02:30:36.380 --> 02:30:37.380
game.

02:30:37.380 --> 02:30:43.480
Number three, if they want to read, they'll buy a fucking book that might be referencing

02:30:43.480 --> 02:30:47.040
how I always like to skip to quest text and wow, I don't know.

02:30:47.040 --> 02:30:51.620
Number two, they press Y to skip as fast as they can.

02:30:51.620 --> 02:30:57.880
And number one, Loki, you could learn from this, don't like it, break it.

02:30:57.880 --> 02:31:03.300
And it's talking about cheat codes aren't as much of a thing with this generation of

02:31:03.300 --> 02:31:04.300
consoles.

02:31:04.300 --> 02:31:07.660
If they're playing a game, basically they like to just go in and cheat and hack and

02:31:07.660 --> 02:31:09.980
exploit and break and mod.

02:31:09.980 --> 02:31:13.740
Well there's a difference between people that want to break games like the people that spawn

02:31:13.740 --> 02:31:19.920
freeze cars in Grand Theft Auto just like, I'm a hacker, I froze you versus, you know,

02:31:19.920 --> 02:31:24.700
people like me that just want to play a really fun game with some weapons that necessarily

02:31:24.700 --> 02:31:28.500
weren't in the stock version of the game.

02:31:28.500 --> 02:31:34.300
All right, last tweet tonight from Fiedelt61 on Twitter tweets us, final fantasy things.

02:31:34.300 --> 02:31:35.300
Fucking want.

02:31:35.300 --> 02:31:39.180
And it's a tweet to a clock here and maybe I'll have to get Dark Soccer to reblog this

02:31:39.180 --> 02:31:41.900
on the Tumblr so you guys can see this too.

02:31:41.900 --> 02:31:46.020
It is a clock that is made up of Final Fantasy logos.

02:31:46.020 --> 02:31:50.540
So like Final Fantasy 12 is at the top and then one, two, three, get it?

02:31:50.540 --> 02:31:53.140
So it's all the different Final Fantasy logos and a clock.

02:31:53.140 --> 02:31:54.740
Send me that and I'll put it on our thing.

02:31:54.740 --> 02:32:00.540
All right, I will send you that link right now so you can reblog that so listeners can

02:32:00.540 --> 02:32:01.540
see it.

02:32:01.540 --> 02:32:05.220
Again, that came to us from Fiedelt61 on Twitter.

02:32:05.220 --> 02:32:08.820
And if you want to send us stuff to cross post, you can send us stuff on Twitter as

02:32:08.820 --> 02:32:10.540
well.

02:32:10.540 --> 02:32:14.820
I guess not having the 800 number tonight just killed us on calls.

02:32:14.820 --> 02:32:17.300
So we're going to go ahead and close up the Skype line.

02:32:17.300 --> 02:32:18.300
That's too bad.

02:32:18.300 --> 02:32:22.420
But then again, it has been kind of a slower week and there's not a lot of new games that

02:32:22.420 --> 02:32:24.660
people are excited to talk about and so forth.

02:32:24.660 --> 02:32:28.420
So we're going to close on up the Skype line and cover any last minute stories.

02:32:28.420 --> 02:32:30.900
See if Loki has any last minute stories he wants to talk about real quick.

02:32:30.900 --> 02:32:34.140
Just one that I think is kind of funny and ironic.

02:32:34.140 --> 02:32:41.700
Facebook has decided that they're changing their game service to look like Google Plus.

02:32:41.700 --> 02:32:47.020
They're actually going to be updating things a little bit.

02:32:47.020 --> 02:32:53.380
I guess they said that game growth has slowed and because of that they're starting to tweak

02:32:53.380 --> 02:32:54.380
things around.

02:32:54.380 --> 02:32:59.100
So they're going to have some sort of, looks like a games tab or something like that and

02:32:59.100 --> 02:33:04.340
different sorting options.

02:33:04.340 --> 02:33:08.980
Hmm, interesting.

02:33:08.980 --> 02:33:12.460
I love how they announced a lot of this like the same day that Google Games came out.

02:33:12.460 --> 02:33:13.460
Yeah.

02:33:13.460 --> 02:33:14.460
It's pretty.

02:33:14.460 --> 02:33:24.420
Their re-open of virility I guess is what they're promising and it basically looks like

02:33:24.420 --> 02:33:28.780
they're ripping off a bunch of ideas that Google Plus had.

02:33:28.780 --> 02:33:31.060
But of course these have been in development for a long time.

02:33:31.060 --> 02:33:32.060
Oh yeah.

02:33:32.060 --> 02:33:35.420
They've been in development for six to twelve months.

02:33:35.420 --> 02:33:36.420
Of course.

02:33:36.420 --> 02:33:37.420
Of course.

02:33:37.420 --> 02:33:38.420
Yeah.

02:33:38.420 --> 02:33:39.420
Anything else?

02:33:39.420 --> 02:33:40.420
That's it.

02:33:40.420 --> 02:33:41.420
All right.

02:33:41.420 --> 02:33:45.420
Well that brings us to the close of another week here at Orange Lounge Radio.

02:33:45.420 --> 02:33:46.980
We will be back next week.

02:33:46.980 --> 02:33:50.740
We will be off in two weeks but we'll be here next week.

02:33:50.740 --> 02:33:53.460
We've been asked about a marathon show this year on Labor Day weekend.

02:33:53.460 --> 02:33:58.500
I kind of don't think that's going to happen this year just because there's a lot going

02:33:58.500 --> 02:34:00.340
on around that time.

02:34:00.340 --> 02:34:04.460
However, we're going to look at targeting another three-day weekend in the future.

02:34:04.460 --> 02:34:06.940
So don't be too disappointed.

02:34:06.940 --> 02:34:10.260
We want to do not just a marathon show but we want to do a marathon that has a little

02:34:10.260 --> 02:34:11.660
more oomph this year.

02:34:11.660 --> 02:34:15.560
So what better time to do it than kicking off the tenth year of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:34:15.560 --> 02:34:17.620
So we'll be looking at that in the future.

02:34:17.620 --> 02:34:18.620
Right Jamie?

02:34:18.620 --> 02:34:19.620
We.

02:34:19.620 --> 02:34:20.620
All right.

02:34:20.620 --> 02:34:24.220
So anyhow let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

02:34:24.220 --> 02:34:25.220
Loki we'll start with you.

02:34:25.220 --> 02:34:28.300
Do you have your final thought tonight?

02:34:28.300 --> 02:34:31.700
My final thought is I'm hopefully going to be able to play some more games this week.

02:34:31.700 --> 02:34:37.540
I had plans on doing that this weekend but that kind of fell through.

02:34:37.540 --> 02:34:43.180
My final thought tonight is I'm looking forward to having some Pinkberry.

02:34:43.180 --> 02:34:44.180
Yay.

02:34:44.180 --> 02:34:45.740
Darsaka your final thought tonight.

02:34:45.740 --> 02:34:48.740
I'm going to read exactly what's on macro memory now.

02:34:48.740 --> 02:34:51.740
50 Cent got shot and still whines about it on stage.

02:34:51.740 --> 02:34:57.340
Teddy Roosevelt got shot mid-speech and didn't leave the stage until he was finished.

02:34:57.340 --> 02:34:58.340
Interesting.

02:34:58.340 --> 02:35:02.180
50 Cent got shot on stage?

02:35:02.180 --> 02:35:03.180
I had no idea.

02:35:03.180 --> 02:35:04.820
No he got shot and he just whines about it.

02:35:04.820 --> 02:35:05.820
Well I mean getting.

02:35:05.820 --> 02:35:06.820
I would.

02:35:06.820 --> 02:35:07.820
If somebody shot me I'd whine.

02:35:07.820 --> 02:35:08.820
Not on stage.

02:35:08.820 --> 02:35:09.820
Oh.

02:35:09.820 --> 02:35:12.140
But Teddy Roosevelt got shot and finished his damn speech.

02:35:12.140 --> 02:35:14.660
Still if I got shot I'd be whining about it.

02:35:14.660 --> 02:35:15.660
All right.

02:35:15.660 --> 02:35:17.740
But that's for another week.

02:35:17.740 --> 02:35:19.780
Actually no I should never be shot actually on the show.

02:35:19.780 --> 02:35:20.780
That would be bad.

02:35:20.780 --> 02:35:21.780
All right that's it.

02:35:21.780 --> 02:35:22.780
We're out.

02:35:22.780 --> 02:35:23.780
Have a wonderful night everybody.

02:35:23.780 --> 02:35:24.780
We'll be back here next week to do it all again.

02:35:24.780 --> 02:35:28.940
Hope to see you here live Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at All

02:35:28.940 --> 02:35:30.060
Games Radio.

02:35:30.060 --> 02:35:31.580
Until then we'll see you next time.

02:35:31.580 --> 02:35:32.620
Thanks for listening.

02:35:32.620 --> 02:35:34.740
Tell a friend about the show if you enjoyed.

02:35:34.740 --> 02:35:35.820
Spread the word Orange Lounge Radio.

02:35:35.820 --> 02:35:40.020
We don't have advertising dollars and so therefore we don't stick the show full of ads while

02:35:40.020 --> 02:35:41.020
we ask word of mouth.

02:35:41.020 --> 02:35:42.020
Have a good night.

02:35:42.020 --> 02:35:45.500
