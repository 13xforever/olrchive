0	20200	Tonight, August 14th, 2011, a patent possibly spills new details on the Wii U controller,
20200	31560	games finally arrive on Google+, and Australia gets a new rating for graphic games.
31560	34480	Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show
34480	40760	where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio. We are live on this lovely Sunday evening,
40760	47060	August the 14th of 2011. My name is Rob Roberts, and with me as always, say hello to the one
47060	51960	and the only, Dark Sakura, Jamie Sommers. Hi. How are you, Jamie Sommers? Burpy. Burpy?
51960	57440	A little gassy? I've been drinking root beer. Having a root beer. Awesome. By the way, it's
57440	66680	episode 424 tonight. 424, it's a palindrome episode. Quite. Like dad and mom. Exactly.
66680	74080	And uh, other words. Alright, not a palindrome, but maybe a prime number, I'm not sure. Say
74080	80960	hello to Techmaster Loki. Don't worry, we'll end the same way as we began. Terrible. Yes,
80960	85040	inevitably when the show ends someday, it will end the same way it began. What are we
85040	89880	just talking about tonight? In fact, Loki will have to do the last episode in one of
89880	94800	those cheap little $5 microphones that like, I don't, what was that microphone we had on
94800	98000	the first episode? It was terrible. You sounded like you were coming through a phone. I believe
98000	103000	it was a piece of phone wire attached to a paper cup. Yeah, something like that. It was
103000	107000	two Dixie cups and a string actually, I think is what he was using. Alright, anyhow, um,
107000	109880	usually we start off the show with how was your gaming week, but I gotta, I gotta start
109880	114360	this off tonight cause this is some big drama. Oh, here's a word. What? I don't wanna hear
114360	119680	about words, I wanna tell you about my dramas. Ibophobia. What's that? Fear of palindromes?
119680	126120	Um, no. A dog, a plan, a canoe. You are so random. Alright, oh, is the word itself a
126120	130040	palindrome? Yeah it is. Oh, okay. I was like, what the hell are you just spouting off random
130040	136760	words for? Are we playing balderdash tonight? Was I not aware? And so is de-leveled. De-leveled
136760	144360	is a palindrome. All right. And uh, as our chat room, God, I love the chatters. Chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
144360	149000	Always present fourth guest on our show. Uh, chat with us live. Uh, and Alpha Kinetogram
149000	154600	starts us off tonight reminding us of another palindrome. He says also boob. Yes. Apparently
154600	161560	ibophobia is an irrational fear of palindromes. Alright. Look, I gotta tell about my dramas.
161560	165480	Okay, dramas. And I just mentioned this to you guys before the show started but you haven't
165480	169080	really heard all the details yet. Details. Still. Here's what's going on. Okay, so you
169080	174280	know how everybody's all up in arms like, oh my gosh, PlayStation 3, our information
174280	180960	all got stolen, uh, Sony's in deep shit and needs to give us all years of credit protection
180960	183920	and all this stuff, right? Yet we haven't really heard of any cases of people actually
183920	187600	getting their information stolen on the PlayStation 3, right? Right. Okay. Well, I didn't have
187600	192240	information on the PlayStation 3 stolen, but I had $125 charged on my Xbox live account
192240	198040	last night. So while everything, and by the way, I'm not the first person to have that
198040	202220	happen. It's happened to one of my friends who hasn't even really played Xbox in like
202220	207120	a year. It's happened to another guy I know on Twitter who I know well from seeing it
207120	211480	like E3 and you know, he's a listener of the show and so forth. And I want to say I've
211480	217560	saw one other case on Facebook as well. So like, it's not an isolated thing. Like folks
217560	221320	are having their Xbox live accounts hacked and I don't know where people are getting
221320	225960	the passwords from. I use different passwords on different websites, so I don't know. I
225960	229600	like to consider myself pretty tech savvy and I don't like to like give my password
229600	235440	up. So I don't know where the password was compromised from, but it happened. Um, if
235440	239160	you guys want to know how I figured it out, um, one of the games I'll talk about during
239160	243040	my gaming week, Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet, I have been loving. So I wanted to sign on
243040	245940	and play it today. I played it last night for a little bit and I wanted to play it today
245940	249580	before the show so I could give you more thoughts on it. When I tried to sign into my account
249580	256240	on Xbox live, it told me that the profile information was corrupt and needed to be re-synced
256240	261360	or it needed to be re-downloaded from Xbox live. Basically the same pop up you get if
261360	267400	you ever have played on somebody else's Xbox. You know, you have to download your data to
267400	272200	be able to play on that other person's Xbox. So that told me my information had been downloaded
272200	276960	to another Xbox, except for the fact that I had just played Shadow Planet last night
276960	281060	and I hadn't played on any other Xboxes since then. I think I would know. The only Xbox
281060	284400	I really used to do that with was Alan's. When I used to drive, when he lived in the
284400	288040	Bay Area, I would go down there, transfer my info for the weekend and come home, transfer
288040	292280	back. I hadn't done that in months. So that told me something was wrong and instantly
292280	297280	the first thing that came to my mind was, wait a minute, I saw Justin tweet about this
297280	300280	like two days ago. His information got hacked. I'm going to go check my bank account right
300280	303240	now. I don't know what made me think to look. Sure enough, I look at my bank account, there's
303240	308760	two charges on it. One for $79.99, one for $49.99, both from Xbox live. And I go into
308760	314380	my Xbox live account and somebody had bought a gold pack, premium pack. I don't even know
314380	318620	what game it was for because by the time I saw that I was already on the phone with Xbox.com.
318620	321080	The good news was I was able to get right through. I didn't have to like wait on hold
321080	325880	for a half hour or anything. Talked to a lady there was fairly helpful, but one thing that
325880	331400	struck me as kind of odd that she told me was that, oh yeah, I got hit for $350 too.
331400	340400	Oh, so a fifth person who works for Microsoft also got hit. And we're all mad at Sony. Why?
340400	347840	No, I understand why we're mad at Sony, but, um, something tells me we need to be a little
347840	353120	irritated with Microsoft right now. Either somehow information got compromised or there's
353120	358280	something out there siphoning our information and they are currently getting all of our
358280	362560	passwords. So my advice to you, you need to stop what you're doing right now and go change
362560	367680	your password on xbox.com because if you haven't, you're at risk for this. So don't come crying
367680	370440	to me when they take $125 from you because it's going to suck.
370440	375760	It's going to suck for them because I don't have $125.
375760	380600	And there's a lot of folks that are saying, uh, I'm going to a chat room, chat.orangeandre.com.
380600	384960	Dick man says, I prefer buying things with cash and this is why. Tiger claw says, sky,
384960	389840	this is why I use the xbox live cards. I never put a credit card. Uh, okay. That's nice to
389840	395000	do in retrospect, but let's face it, I didn't do that. Microsoft doesn't exactly make it
395000	400680	easy either to do things that way, especially once they have your credit card from an xbox
400680	405120	live account, you know, that I had set up for gold many years ago. I've only had one
405120	409480	card on the xbox account and it's been expired now for four years. And if you want to take
409480	413600	it off, I think you have to call to get it removed. Like you can't even, yeah, it's ridiculous.
413600	418160	It's a pain in the ass. They wouldn't be able to use it anyway, cause it's expired. So,
418160	422240	and I've never renewed it. Something's coming for Microsoft. Cause I'm telling you this
422240	426380	is happening more and more and it's not going to stop with just me and the people I've spoke
426380	431240	about unless miraculously we've convinced the entire internet to change their passwords.
431240	435920	Uh, it's going to keep happening and I kind of think Microsoft needs to speak up a little
435920	439280	bit about what's going on. If nothing else, they should be putting out some bulletins
439280	443880	about security alerts because this is just more work for them. I want to tell you this
443880	448840	by the way as well, which is really important, is that the whole process for them to investigate
448840	455640	is going to take 21 days. So I'm not going to see that money back for 21 days. Now, luckily
455640	461160	I'm gainfully employed. I have a savings account. I can cover the loss of that money for 21
461160	464760	days. It doesn't affect me, but I know we have a lot of college kids that listen to
464760	469960	this show. They're like, I don't even have $125 for them to steal. So I'm just warning
469960	474000	you, you know, do something about it. I have thought about calling the bank, but I thought
474000	480400	at the end of the day, ironically enough, my card expires next month. So I was kind
480400	484200	of thinking like, you know, why go through all that hassle when I'm going to be getting
484200	490200	a new card anyway. And it's just kind of like if you start flagging all the Microsoft transactions
490200	493840	as suspect, then that's probably going to give me more headache in the future. Also
493840	497320	for all these people who say that you don't have that money in your account, keep in mind
497320	503240	that what you put on there is a credit card attached to your bank account in most cases
503240	509200	or an actual credit card. So if you don't have the money and they charge you, it's going
509200	512400	to go through anyway and you're going to have to deal with overdraft charges on top of it.
512400	517080	Right. So, you know, well, the good thing is most banks have a protection thing and
517080	520840	you know, it's at least there's a way to have it investigated, but it's just the whole thing
520840	525720	is frustrating. And just, you know, once again, knowing that someone has stolen my information
525720	530920	is, is kind of crappy. It's a crappy feeling. I have no other way to explain it. And the
530920	536520	reason why I say once again, I had my Warcraft account hacked about, probably about three
536520	540420	years ago at this point. It was a little while ago, but it was, it was part of the reason
540420	544080	why I took a big break from wow for a while. It happened right around the time that Old
544080	549280	War was current content, Wrath of the Lich King. And I just logging back into my character,
549280	552600	it didn't feel like my character anymore. Like, yeah, Blizzard had refunded all the
552600	557000	stuff and put it all back in the mail, but it just felt, I don't know, like it just felt
557000	558000	dirty.
558000	562000	So yeah, it kind of ruined wow for me for a little while. When I came back to wow, I
562000	566720	rolled a new character. I haven't touched that character since that whole incident three,
566720	572280	three some odd years ago. So learn from my mistake, I guess, although I don't think I
572280	577000	made a mistake. I mean, with Warcraft, I'm pretty internet savvy and I don't log into
577000	582960	a lot of suspicious stuff, but my ex was not internet savvy and I did play wow on his computer.
582960	587040	So I think I know how I got compromised there, but this, I'm having a really hard time figuring
587040	593480	it out. I don't know.
593480	597840	How many other systems have you at all played on?
597840	604520	Just Alans. Maybe one of Loki's systems years ago, but that would be it. Like, honestly
604520	605920	it would just be Alans or
605920	610080	it seems to me then that it's a breach with, from within Microsoft or an old Xbox of mine
610080	613880	that I would have given to Loki, but we wiped. No, cause I had the old hard drive. It wouldn't
613880	615840	have the information cause I have the old hard drive.
615840	621240	I don't have any hard drives, zeros anyways, and all the systems I have, like I said, I
621240	624800	don't have the hard drives. So, and then it seems to me that it's something from internal.
624800	629440	Yeah. And once again, it wouldn't matter anyways, even if your profile is on there, unless I
629440	635040	need your password, it wouldn't matter. Yeah. So, and I mean, and if in that case you could
635040	638880	all you would really need, all you would really need to know is the email address that you
638880	646480	used for your account and the password, basically the live.com login details, and then you recover
646480	647840	your profile that way.
647840	654540	So it's a bummer, but uh, yeah, that happened. So just kind of a heads up warning to folks.
654540	659720	So you know, now I'm out that money, but luckily I have money in savings. I'm just gonna transfer
659720	664760	over to cover it. It's not too big of a deal for me. Thankfully I have a savings, but I
664760	668200	just don't want to see it happen to many more people because it's a shitty feeling and I
668200	671960	kind of want to know how it happened. You know, you want to know like somebody's trying
671960	675680	to steal money from me. Who is it? I want to kick their ass. That's what I want to know
675680	680720	right now. So I guess we'll, we'll see what happens, but it's not just me. You guys, you
680720	682360	guys are probably seeing it on your Facebooks too.
682360	688760	Yeah. If you do a search on Google and you know, for a Xbox live or hacked Xbox live
688760	692880	account and search for the past week, there's plenty of links for people saying, Hey, my
692880	698240	account's been hacked. Wow. Uh, Bobby just sent me a private message.
698240	701880	I'm not going to say who it was, but he knows somebody else that got hit for a hundred dollars.
701880	708000	So good gosh, it's this, this is like, it's not isolating you guys. That's why I'm bringing
708000	711920	it up. Like we've all been panicking about Sony, Sony, Sony, Sony, but nothing ended
711920	715980	up happening with that data. Not to say nothing ever will. Don't sit on your laurels. Make
715980	719360	sure everything's been changed and your passwords are up to date there too. But I'm just saying
719360	727280	like, if you thought Microsoft was better, you're wrong. Listen up fan boys. I got $125
727280	734320	stolen from my Xbox account today. Microsoft is no better than Sony. I'm here to tell you.
734320	738480	So that's what I wanted to just kick off tonight's show with a lovely little warning that no
738480	743040	company is immune from all of this data theft going on. If there's money somewhere to steal,
743040	748440	somebody is going to try to steal it. It doesn't matter what company it is on that note. Let's
748440	752440	talk about your gaming week and the types of video games you've been playing this week.
752440	755480	I won't be able to play my, by the way, I can't sign into my account for 21 days. They've
755480	759120	suspended my account during the investigation, which will take three weeks. They say I can
759120	762960	play offline stuff and what have you, but most of the stuff I play is Xbox live arcade
762960	766880	and I just, I don't want my achievements to get screwed up. So I basically won't be playing
766880	770680	Xbox for the next three weeks. So if you see me on in the next three weeks, you might want
770680	775600	to drop me an email cause it's not me. I won't be playing for the next three weeks. PlayStation
775600	780040	three. Here I come. Woo. All right. Dark soccer. How was your game? Come over here and play
780040	786200	super Metroid. Funny enough, I've been playing a Metroid very much like game this week, but
786200	793000	I'll get to that in a minute. Dark soccer. How was your gaming week? Um, well, and stupid
793000	802720	freaking tiny tower, fucking bitizens and grateful wretches. Um, and so just a few things
802720	811240	on steam here and there, you know, nothing major. Just sort of meh. That's about it.
811240	818880	But Rebecca black is level 70. Congratulations. Fun, fun, fun, fun. Yeah. Gang fight. Now
818880	823200	who's now who plays nothing but wow. It's very interesting how things have changed in
823200	826580	a year. Hey, I got to look at some of these comments that are coming in from chat room
826580	830620	about the hacking going on. Xenocore in our chat room says, remember if Microsoft locks
830620	834460	down your account, your games for windows stuff will also be locked down. So check your
834460	841940	xbox live now you can't play dawn of war two offline because it requires a login. Um, thankfully
841940	848000	I don't use games for windows. I use steam or does anyone else? I have used game room.
848000	853520	That's about the extent of it on games. Oh no. Your game room. You won't be able to download
853520	859520	any more game room games. Oh no. All those releases that you're missing out on. No, but
859520	863160	I get, I mean Xenocore saying dawn of war two is, you know, tied into that and I'm sure
863160	866600	there's other games, you know, we're here and we have a story on it tonight. All these
866600	871360	companies want to tie you into their online service. So if you're a fan of one of these
871360	876540	games, you kind of get screwed. So there you go. Uh, let's see. Going to other comments
876540	882380	in chat. Uh, black Wolf clarifies he got hit while he was playing. I only must've missed
882380	886840	it by a couple hours cause I was on last night and then I noticed it this morning. Um, let's
886840	892240	see. Uh, sick man in our chat room says the only mistake you made sky was buying Microsoft
892240	897920	products. It's the same mistake a lot of us have made. No, I'm sorry. That's I wanted
897920	902400	to play shadow plan. That's actually probably the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.
902400	907200	It's a little bit fanboy ish, but you know, obviously there's some haters out there. A
907200	912400	Microsoft. Oh, come on. Like PlayStation people can hate on Microsoft about network security.
912400	916960	Come on. You can't say shit. Exactly. Like so Sony fanboys can't point and laugh at what's
916960	923520	going on here. You can't, but $125 7 million account point to telling this story was Microsoft
923520	928880	fans can't point and laugh at Sony. You are not allowed. I'm here to tell you because
928880	933180	money was actually stolen in this case. You are not allowed to point and laugh at what's
933180	937880	going on with Sony and you're not allowed to tell people that they can't, you know,
937880	941160	this, this is what you get for supporting Sony or whatever bullshit I read on Twitter
941160	946160	during that whole stuff going on. Zebun chat says, I don't have any info on my Xbox account.
946160	950400	I have a silver account. I don't know. I, you know, like I said, my card is up in September
950400	955640	and uh, I'm definitely having thoughts to keeping a card online now. I think I might've
955640	961400	learned my lesson. I decay. Well, if your card auto new renews, just be where there's,
961400	966400	you know, a whole lawsuit, you know, we'll get into probably later on about, you know,
966400	969760	matter how they'll still try to charge it. And then when you put a new card on there,
969760	975560	they'll charge it twice. Oh jeez. Well, my card expires before Xbox live does, so it
975560	980800	won't matter. Anyhow, uh, Loki, how was your gaming week? Um, pretty good actually. I played
980800	986400	lots of stuff. I played tiny tower, of course. I played it, what I call the abridged version,
986400	991280	which is I cheated the hell out of it and I finished the game completely. I literally
991280	996560	have built as much of the tiny tower as I possibly can. I have all the shops, all of
996560	1003400	the different everything, all maxed out, all the achievements. I have as many, um, citizens
1003400	1007120	as you can possibly fit in the building. All I can do now is build a bunch of empty floors
1007120	1011280	and that's your cheater. I don't care cause you know what? That game is annoying. That
1011280	1015400	game made my brain melt. It's seriously, that's the feeling I got from playing. I'm like,
1015400	1019840	Oh, so I'm so glad that we done this game yet. You played it till you got every single
1019840	1025040	achievement anyway, although you cheated cheer. Hey, you know what? I save time. That's why
1025040	1029680	I look at it. I don't like games that make me have to go and play like, you know, go
1029680	1036040	back and you know, Oh, Oh no, you know something you haven't stocked the shelves. I would think
1036040	1040440	that if I'm hiring employees to work in these stores and you know, they're paying me rent
1040440	1044240	and stuff, I would think that they should be smart enough to know, Hey, we're out of
1044240	1050760	stuff. Maybe we should, I don't know, restock it. Why should I have the game Loki? What
1050760	1055720	would the game be? You see your problem with tiny tower is that it's not tiny tower sniper.
1055720	1059560	That's your problem with it. That's not my problem with it. There's been games, you know,
1059560	1066520	like a theme park. I love theme park and um, you know, everybody's talking about was it
1066520	1071760	mall store. I saw that, you know, and I may have to try that, but it's um, you know, just
1071760	1077080	like, uh, was a game dev story. That's pretty fun. Bobby says that tiny tower has a bug
1077080	1080880	right now. Yeah, it's got, if you have it open, you're only earning half the cash or
1080880	1085800	something like that. Then newest version botched something. Yeah, I'm earning a lot of cash.
1085800	1092240	I will actually, I can't get any cash. I already robbed the tiny bank and you took all their
1092240	1104120	money. It's more like he printed his own money with his tiny printing press. Uh, so yeah,
1104120	1109880	I played that. By the way, I've gotten some FUs on Google and Twitter for mentioning tiny
1109880	1115560	tower on this program. FU for getting me into tiny tower. I've seen that multiple times
1115560	1121320	this week. Uh, let's see, what else did I play? I tried playing juke beat on my iPod
1121320	1127560	and you know, juke beat, see, the thing about it is it seems like a simple idea. You just
1127560	1132600	tap the, you know, squares as they light up and stuff like that, but for some reason like
1132600	1136800	the difficulty is way too high on that. I'm assuming it's because I have an iPod and it's
1136800	1141600	really small, but you can, you can tweak it so that, you know, the touch area is really
1141600	1146040	big. So like you can actually touch in the middle between two squares and it'll tap both
1146040	1152800	of them. But like even still after doing that, I still keep failing a level two song. And
1152800	1158520	I'm sorry, if it's that hard, then it's a little ridiculous. Why would I want to buy
1158520	1163280	more songs? You know, which by the way, the song packs that they have are kind of terrible.
1163280	1167920	So they're very terrible actually. Um, since you brought it up, I want to, cause I downloaded
1167920	1171680	juke beat as well. You know, it's the new Bahmani game. It's on iOS, which is the roots
1171680	1176000	of orange lawns radio is in Bahmani and I'm about to make the most ironic statement ever
1176000	1180160	in the history of this show. And I mean history cause you have to go way back to why the statement
1180160	1185640	is ironic. Um, I really think re rave is a better game than juke beat. I really do. It's
1185640	1190280	got better music. The game itself is just better. Yes. I'm saying the game that the
1190280	1194680	in the group people made is better than the game. No, no, I can't believe I'm saying it's
1194680	1201280	true. I agree. It is. It is true. And the reason why it's true is because I shouldn't
1201280	1206160	be failing a level two song. I mean, this is like if you're going to DDR, okay, you
1206160	1210200	just suck a juke beat. Oh no, no. I must. I'm reading the comments from the internet
1210200	1215120	right now. You just, I'm imagining these guys. Look, you just suck a juke beat. You just,
1215120	1220920	you just, you know. Well, I understand that this game, this game may be better on an iPad.
1220920	1225380	That's fine. I don't own an iPad. You need to memorize the patterns. You need to make
1225380	1229600	it iPad only. Well, I understand you need to memorize the patterns. You have to do that
1229600	1233880	in DDR sometimes to, you know, be able to beat some of the harder songs. But those are
1233880	1238720	like, you know, eights and nines and stuff like that. You know, whereas can you imagine
1238720	1242300	like butterfly or something like that and beginner, you know, the ones that they have
1242300	1247640	the actual animation on screen and stuff and having to kick your ass. I mean, just the
1247640	1251760	only thing about juke beat that's like irritating is that when that little thing comes up, you
1251760	1257000	have like less than a second to hit it. Like you, you have no time to react. It's like,
1257000	1260920	and you're playing that first song is like, like literally it's lighting up. Like there's
1260920	1265640	a little passage in the Frogger song that goes do, do, do, do, do, do. So you have to
1265640	1269840	be able to like hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it. Like you've got to like,
1269840	1273800	it's like playing whack-a-mole at hyper speed. And there's no real indication of what's going
1273800	1279600	to be next other than, you know, it just moving really fast. And I don't know, it, if maybe
1279600	1284680	Ubeat is a little bit better in the arcades, I'm not really sure, but if this is exactly
1284680	1288480	what it is in the arcades, I'm not too excited about it. But hey, and you know what, kind
1288480	1296240	of cool, Lisa, they put something else out. But it's just kind of eh. SSJ100Matt confirms
1296240	1302120	in chat, Juby, which is its name over in Japan, on the iPad is a lot better. And I could see
1302120	1306240	where on the iPad, my fat finger isn't getting in the way. So I can actually like see all
1306240	1311200	the things. I can like lay it on a table and probably play it easier. But on the iPhone,
1311200	1314940	it's really bad. But that's fine. But then you know what they need to do then? They need
1314940	1319880	to create an iPad app and then they need to create an iPhone app. Well, it's, it's you,
1319880	1323980	it's universal. Oh, well that's, I know that's an easy way to get around doing that. I kind
1323980	1328000	of like that it's universal. They're not going to charge me again for an iPad version. All
1328000	1332160	universal is means it has both versions in one. You can still have different versions
1332160	1337200	of the game. I think Tiny Towers universal too. Okay, but still, then why is it play
1337200	1343360	so terrible? I mean, I, I didn't have this problem with ReRave. ReRave, it was easy enough
1343360	1349240	for me to hit everything. I think ReRave just makes sense and this game doesn't. I'm sorry.
1349240	1355160	It's just kind of where I'm at with it. I think ReRave was just more interesting. The
1355160	1359780	targets are a lot bigger. They come up with more advanced notice. They're actually on
1359780	1365000	the beat and you can tell like, oh, a red one means it's on the downbeat. A blue one
1365000	1370080	means it's on the upbeat. Like it just, it makes more sense. Like, oh fuck, there's notes
1370080	1377080	everywhere. Like stuff that they used to do in DDR. You know, it's like Konami, you forget
1377080	1381520	that you released music games in the past and what you did to make, you know, make those
1381520	1385480	accessibility. See, that's what I don't understand. This is a company that understands accessibility
1385480	1392480	with their DDR games. A little too much accessibility if you ask me, but yet for some reason, a
1392560	1398160	casual gaming platform as you would normally view it, they made this game so fucking difficult
1398160	1403200	that most people would be just like, eh, whatever, and they're just gonna get, they'll delete
1403200	1408000	it cause it's free. Yeah, I mean, at least I can say that JukeBeat's free, so check it
1408000	1411200	out, download it. Maybe you'll like it even though we're sitting here, but I'll tell you
1411200	1414840	what, the songs that it comes with are pretty good, but just like listening to all the little
1414840	1419220	clips from the download stuff, wow, they're bad. They're all bad. I love that Contra song.
1419220	1422800	That Contra song is awesome, but the rest of the songs are terrible. The Frogger song
1422800	1426280	was good. I don't like Frogger. Frogger needs to die. I mean, they need to stop putting
1426280	1432960	out new Frogger games. The 3DS Frogger, eh. I don't understand the point for the 3DS Frogger,
1432960	1439240	but whatever. At least they're doing something slightly different with it. But, yeah, in
1439240	1443480	Frogger, not really a game I know for its music. In fact, I don't believe there was
1443480	1448000	any music in Frogger. Alright, I gotta read some comments from chat here. We're backing
1448000	1453360	up on comments here. Going back to the hacking stuff, Sickman wanted to clarify an earlier
1453360	1458520	comment and says, Sky, you completely misunderstood me. I meant they make shitty hardware. I'm
1458520	1462800	not gonna disagree with you there. The hardware Xbox makes, I mean, considering the whole
1462800	1466600	Red, Rings of Death and all the other crap they've had to deal with. Yeah, Microsoft
1466600	1472800	does kind of make shitty hardware, but my problem wasn't a hardware issue. At all.
1472800	1481800	Yeah. Other things I played this week. VVVVVVV because I got the Humble in the Bundle, and
1481800	1486280	yeah, it's very difficult, and I'm kind of frustrated. I'm at this one level in the game
1486280	1492280	where you have to escort this guy across the screen, and it's annoying. It's just annoying
1492280	1501000	in the controls because it's very floaty, I guess. So, but hey, you get unlimited lives,
1501000	1504640	it's just, sometimes it's annoying. But I think I'm almost finished with the game. I
1504640	1508320	have like, I think two more people to rescue and that's it. Yeah, but there might be a
1508320	1511400	whole little twist coming up or something. Yeah, I don't care. Remember how Castlevania
1511400	1520200	had the upside down castle? Yeah. Be ready. And then other than that, let's see, I played
1520200	1524320	more Earth Defense Force. I downloaded the two weapons packs for that. I still haven't
1524320	1531200	gotten a chance to actually try the weapons, but I've downloaded them. And then also, more
1531200	1535960	Grand Theft Auto, of course. And I do have in Singling Twisted Shadow Planet, but still
1535960	1543720	haven't played it yet. I'm really wanting to play it because the reviews have been great,
1543720	1551800	so hopefully soon. I think that's all I've played. All right. I'll talk about my gaming
1551800	1555360	week, besides what I mentioned at the top of the show. Well, I have mentioned I played
1555360	1560020	Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet, which I was enjoying. It's basically Metroid with kind
1560020	1564560	of like Limbo's graphics, in a way. I don't know how else to explain it. I really like
1564560	1569760	it. Like, I downloaded the demo and the minute I realized, I'm like, oh, this is like fucking
1569760	1574120	Metroid, except it's a spaceship that you control. So it's more of a, you don't just
1574120	1579760	move left and right and jump, you fly anywhere you want. Otherwise, it's that same concept
1579760	1585120	where you try to find items that will break open the way to other items and so forth and
1585120	1589800	exploration. And you know, I really like those types of games, the exploration games. Does
1589800	1596240	it really do much to set up a story? I mean, there's movies and so on, but it doesn't exactly
1596240	1602940	hand you the what to do on a silver platter. It's very abstract in some ways, but it doesn't
1602940	1606080	really take away from the experience. I was really enjoying the game and I'm kind of pissed.
1606080	1609400	I'm not gonna be able to play it for three more weeks because I was on a roll and I kind
1609400	1612600	of wanted to beat it. Uh, but I only got about maybe a third of the way. I think it said
1612600	1616980	I was like 30% complete or 33% complete. I won't be able to do that now for three weeks.
1616980	1623640	So hackers, did you recover your profile to your system? No, you were unable to do that.
1623640	1628680	No. Well, they, they said I could play offline, but I just, I don't know. I'm going to, because
1628680	1631840	I don't want to get screwed up and all that. Yeah, it will get screwed up. I was gonna
1631840	1635340	see if you recovered your profile to your system, you can play it and it wouldn't matter
1635340	1639120	because they would sync back up when you're done. But if you haven't, then yeah. So those
1639120	1644000	humans would go, bye bye. Yeah, no, I didn't do that. So now I'm, I'm kind of stuck. So
1644000	1649500	it's all right. I've got some stuff on PlayStation three I want to play. Uh, but just irritating.
1649500	1653200	And then there's always, wow. Right. Jamie, we've got a lot of ratings. You can play some
1653200	1658400	LA noir. That's right. I have not touched LA noir yet and I have your copy on PSO. Yes,
1658400	1663720	I'm totally missing it right now. I do need to play it. So this, the silver lining in
1663720	1667440	my crap story is there are PS3 games. I actually got back my games that I've been learning
1667440	1670600	out to people and like, so I completely forgot that I've been learning out. Like I got my
1670600	1676460	three dot game heroes back in a portal to my other like portal to on like every goddamn
1676460	1681080	system now. That's an, I need to go back and finish co-op and portal to, that's another
1681080	1684760	thing I need to do. It's like I've got plenty to do. I've got, and randomly, okay, so insane
1684760	1689080	twisted shadow planet. If you like Metroid, you need to be downloading the demo right
1689080	1694640	now after you change your Xbox live password, go check it out because, or the Castlevania,
1694640	1699480	what Metroidvania, any of those types of games, you will like this game. It's got really pretty
1699480	1704480	sharp graphics. It's like playing a cartoon. It's really cool. You've got to check it out.
1704480	1707440	Jamie, I think you would really like this. You really need to make it a point to check
1707440	1713520	it out this week. Okay. I'll tell Dan, at least get the demo, at least get the demo.
1713520	1722840	All right. Um, by the way, I forgot, so go ahead. Okay. Other games I randomly had a,
1722840	1727640	I want to play civilization five and when you want to play civilization five, that turns
1727640	1732040	into a five minute thought that goes on for like four hours because you can't just like
1732040	1736760	stop playing civilization five. So I played an entire campaign over the weekend. You were
1736760	1740600	still playing when I went to bed. I was, yeah, I was playing as the Spanish and I played
1740600	1744800	from start to finish. Granted, I was playing on dopey easy level because I'm really not
1744800	1749600	good at civilization, but I beat it. I did a cultural victory and I got the, no one expects
1749600	1755680	the Spanish Inquisition achievement. So now I'm playing another, what better way to, I
1755680	1760280	kicked it up a difficulty level and now I'm playing as, who am I playing as? The Russians.
1760280	1765960	I'm playing as the Russians and I'm going to, um, uh, hopefully win a scientific victory.
1765960	1769760	That's what I'm going for this time. So I, I really love Civ five. I don't know what
1769760	1773320	made me decide to play it again. Just, you know, you see it sitting there in steam and
1773320	1776640	I'm like, I didn't play this game in a while. I'm gonna play it. Granted, there is the new
1776640	1780120	download content. I know you might be thinking, Oh, maybe you saw like the Korean download
1780120	1783440	content and the new scenarios. I don't really play a lot of scenarios. I like to just play
1783440	1789120	random skirmishes, but I love how customizable the game is. Civilization one is my all time
1789120	1794320	favorite game next to super Metroid. Probably it's my all time favorite PC game. Uh, so
1794320	1798600	it's no secret that I adore Civ five. I think it's one of the best in the series. It's certainly
1798600	1803920	better than two or three. Four was pretty good too though. Uh, but I love five. So I
1803920	1809560	was playing that and, um, on the PlayStation three extra for had a random gaming night
1809560	1815160	last night. So a couple of us went over there and, uh, played hardcore uprising, which is
1815160	1819880	the Contra game that's on X-Box three 60 and it's on PlayStation three. So we were playing
1819880	1824440	that for a little bit, uh, which is, you know, it's a, it's Contra hard as hell, just like
1824440	1831480	you remember. Um, and then we were playing, um, super smash brothers. Melee is the one
1831480	1836000	on the Wii, right? I was getting mixed up brawls on the Wii. I can never remember which
1836000	1842360	ones, which we played the Wii one for a little while. And, uh, then we played one other game
1842360	1845640	that I'm totally forgetting right now. Oh, we played Katamari forever on the PlayStation
1845640	1849480	three. I know random, right? But you know, I brought a stack of games over and that's
1849480	1854280	what we chose to play. So that was my game night. That's pretty much my gaming week.
1854280	1859280	Lots. I've been pretty busy. And then of course, wow, wow, wow. Lots of wow stuff, but I have
1859280	1864600	the other show for that. Someone's going to teach me how to tank for a fee. I'm just kidding.
1864600	1870560	All right. I'll pay you in pink Berry. All right. Uh, black Wolf in our chat room says,
1870560	1874320	I love playing dopey on dopey, easy level and Civ five. It's so much fun. That's the
1874320	1878640	way to play. That's, that's the best way to play Civ five. Uh, especially if you're not
1878640	1883200	very good at the, uh, strategical types of games. All right. Uh, that's going to do it
1883200	1887600	for, uh, how was our gaming week? Hope you guys had a good gaming week too. Uh, quickly
1887600	1892520	some housekeeping. Um, we were still having shows over the next few weeks. You guys are
1892520	1896480	going to do a show when I'm not here. Right. You said you're going to do it anyway. No,
1896480	1905400	no, you're not doing, I thought you were no, I'm babysitting on a Sunday. Yes. Okay. Um,
1905400	1912080	no, not a human baby. Oh, the kitty babies. That's on the 29th and 31st I think. I'm still
1912080	1916920	watching the kitty babies. So no show the 28th then? Yeah. All right. Yes. A show or
1916920	1925320	yes. No. No show. No show on the 28th. So you can plan accordingly. All right. Uh, visit
1925320	1929400	us on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange launch radio and of course Twitter, twitter.com
1929400	1934880	slash O L R. We'll be taking some of your tweets. Yes. And our tumbler now too. Orange
1934880	1938960	launch radio dot tumbler dot com. All right. Look, you just beat one of the hard parts
1938960	1944560	of DVD. I fucking hate that stupid mission. I hated that too. I'll just put this on pause
1944560	1947520	for now. All right. Uh, yeah, you got to put it on pause cause you got to start us off
1947520	1951320	with some news tonight. What's going on in the gaming world tonight? Uh, lots of stuff.
1951320	1955760	So let's start talking about, uh, the steam trading beta that they're going to have, which
1955760	1960840	is kind of cool in case if you're buying some packs and you get a bunch of extra games or
1960840	1965880	stuff gifted to you that you may already have and whatnot. Um, basically what this is gonna
1965880	1974200	allow you to do is, uh, trade different items for, I guess, didn't really say yet, but like
1974200	1980280	for example, you can trade, I can know why you would do this trade like games for hacks
1980280	1987320	and team fortress too. Yeah. I don't know about that. Um, yeah. Right now the service
1987320	1992680	only supports trading of items, um, I guess in team fortress too, but they're going to
1992680	1997680	be, um, supporting everything soon. I guess, um, portal too. So I think maybe they're talking
1997680	2002000	a little bit more of just actually like in game items right now. Um, but eventually you'll
2002000	2007640	be able to trade for games and whatnot. Um, I guess they're going to be allowing you to
2007640	2016680	trade for games. So, uh, that's kinda cool. And actually if you think about it, I mean,
2016680	2021080	I mean, that's pretty cool that they're heading in that direction anyways. Cause if you think
2021080	2027760	about it, you can swap games with people. I mean, essentially, I think it's a neat idea.
2027760	2032200	I mean, it's still in its early, early stages obviously. So of course it's kind of restricted
2032200	2038800	to valve products. I mean, I guess it's not just valve products you can trade, but I guess
2038800	2042800	the stuff that you can trade for right now is really only valve, at least with the micro
2042800	2048200	transaction type of stuff. So it's still very vague to me, like how this all works. Cause
2048200	2051520	I don't really have any extra copies of games straight right now. I wish I'd known this
2051520	2056680	when I bought Terraria. I wouldn't have given a copy to Jamie. I would have traded it away.
2056680	2064920	Hey. Okay, fine. I like Minecraft Aria. I had four copies that game and I literally
2064920	2070440	gave a copy to somebody. I was like, I think he'll like it. I don't know. I don't even
2070440	2075560	know if he's played it. So I could have traded that for a hat, but I don't know. And it's
2075560	2079400	interesting though. I mean, how often do you just have spare copies of games lying around,
2079400	2084280	but sometimes you buy these packs and you kind of get the extra copies. So I like the
2084280	2091180	idea of being able to trade them for either a game I really want, or I guess a little
2091180	2096080	piece of something, something in the game. Like I kind of like go, eh, I don't really
2096080	2099600	need a hat in team fortress two, cause I don't really play that game. But then I go, huh,
2099600	2104720	if 2k bought into this, I could buy the Korean civilization expansion for Civ five and that
2104720	2109800	I would enjoy. So yeah, that's amazing how this buy sell trade stuff works and how people
2109800	2116160	like it and how it promotes the sales of new items. That's amazing. Gee, I wish publishers
2116160	2124200	would have thought of that. I don't think we're getting to the topic again. Of course
2124200	2131440	of how they're trying to discourage buy sell trade stuff with more of the online codes
2131440	2136120	and whatnot. They don't understand that they're just... I think we have a game that's doing
2136120	2141800	something. It's something different than an online pass. Yeah, anyway, so, um, but they
2141800	2147240	don't understand that they're only hurting themselves. I mean, by discouraging buy sell...
2147240	2152920	First off, the argument, and I've said this a few times, but I'll say it again, the argument
2152920	2158280	that the developers don't get money for these games if people are buying used copies is
2158280	2164720	a bunch of bullshit because, for one, the developers get money when the game is sold
2164720	2171920	from the publisher, not bought in the store. Perfect example, Catherine. They came out
2171920	2175760	and they're all, oh yeah, we've shipped 200,000 units and they're celebrating and stuff like
2175760	2181840	that. Then the NPD numbers come out for July and they've only sold 78,000 of those 200,000
2181840	2188440	that were shipped. Perfect example, though. But they got paid for 200,000 copies. So say,
2188440	2194560	for example, your average gamer that's gonna... they can't afford new games. And so they're
2194560	2199120	buying used games, they're selling their used games, you know, trading them into like a
2199120	2204480	GameStop or wherever to get credit towards a new game. That new game wouldn't be sold
2204480	2209400	if you're discouraging, first off, the game companies and, you know, other people from
2209400	2214880	selling used games in the first place. Then these people, they have to pony up real money
2214880	2219240	in order to buy this stuff and, you know what, most of the time people are just gonna say,
2219240	2223520	eh, maybe I just don't need that game. And that's really gonna hurt your bottom line
2223520	2229240	in the end, because you're being greedy and trying to get a few extra sales. It's just
2229240	2233280	gotta all play out. But unfortunately, people don't seem to care too much, once again, because
2233280	2239120	EA's been doing it for over a year now with their sports games and I've really seen a
2239120	2245160	lot of hits from their sports games, you know, oh those sales have hurt so bad. Or not at
2245160	2249720	all. I think what Steam is doing is kinda smart because, you know, it's gonna encourage
2249720	2255280	people to buy extra copies of games and buy the game packs just to have shit to trade.
2255280	2259860	Like at the end of the day, I think this is gonna generate more money. Exactly! People
2259860	2265280	are gonna wanna have the stuff in their pocket that they can barter. Like, I don't think...
2265280	2268480	not everybody, but I think there's gonna be some people that are like, oh, I could buy
2268480	2272760	the multi-pack for just a few dollars more and I guess I could maybe trade somebody that
2272760	2279400	for DLC and get like a deal there. It's opening up this whole new flea market style thing
2279400	2284760	for games that's really interesting to me. Yeah. Looking forward to that. Are you purchasing
2284760	2288720	something on Steam right now? Yes. I'm being nosy, what are you buying? Oddworld Abe's
2288720	2300640	Odyssey is $1.24. Oh. A whole dollar? Yeah. I like Oddworld. Oddworld's cool. Alright.
2300640	2307620	So looking at our chatroom at chat.orangelaungeradio.com, Infinel in our chatroom says, buy games during
2307620	2313040	the special deals at 75% off, trade later when the price goes back to normal. Possibly.
2313040	2319000	Let's see. Breakman in chat says, what kind of in-game items does Portal 2 have? Nothing
2319000	2323660	yet, but that's... Hats. Well, yeah, there are hats, but aren't they supposed to be getting
2323660	2328280	some other stuff soon? Yeah, where the hell is that download content that we were promised
2328280	2338200	back in June? IDK. Is that gonna come out before or after Half-Life 2 Episode 3? After?
2338200	2345440	Damn. Do you see the people protesting outside of Valve for Half-Life 3? I know one of the
2345440	2349160	guys that was doing it. It was apparently Old Gildy of mine from Valve. Okay, I'm sorry.
2349160	2353440	Let me put it this way. I think they were just having fun. Okay, well good, I'm glad
2353440	2358560	they're having fun because you know what? Gabe isn't starving for sales. He's definitely
2358560	2364240	not starving at all. I mean, so there's no reason to think that they're in a hurry to
2364240	2373240	make, you know, Half-Life 2 Episode 3. I got the sense that it was just, you know, it was
2373240	2380080	something fun to do. They'll do whatever. I mean, they'll work on it. I would think
2380080	2385520	at this point they gotta be... I would think that they would wanna do a new engine. I mean,
2385520	2391160	how long have they been using the goddamn Half-Life 2 engine? Forever. They may have
2391160	2394240	to make a new engine or something. Maybe that's what they're doing. So it's been taken ten
2394240	2401000	years. IDK. Maybe. Alright, moving on. Talking about other games and so forth. PC games specifically.
2401000	2405800	Battlefield 3. And you know what's interesting is one of the ways a lot of people got hooked
2405800	2409320	on Steam was that if you wanted to play certain Valve games, you kinda had to install Steam
2409320	2412660	and then everybody saw the deals that came with that. And then of course a bunch of other
2412660	2416440	publishers got on board and we just talked earlier, there was a chat room comment about
2416440	2422200	some games that require game for Windows to power them. Well, EA is soon going to be requiring
2422200	2427360	Origin for Battlefield 3. That's right, if you wanna play the PC version of Battlefield
2427360	2432480	3, you will have to register for EA's Origin service. This came from the DICE community
2432480	2437880	manager Daniel Matros. This is all confirmed via Twitter. I guess somebody had put it out
2437880	2442760	there if this was gonna be a requirement and it was confirmed. So retail, digital, doesn't
2442760	2447560	matter where you buy it, you will have to sign up for Origin. Which if I'm not mistaken,
2447560	2453440	EA's whole online thing kinda all shifted to Origin anyway. So it doesn't totally surprise
2453440	2459640	me, but I don't know. It's just like, I really don't want 5,000 stores sitting on my computer
2459640	2463040	desktop. I always thought it was stupid that you'd have to have some sort of EA account
2463040	2469120	anyways for their games. Period. The fact that they're doing Origin is not a big surprise
2469120	2473560	either that they want to get into the digital marketplace, but their excuse for why their
2473560	2478000	game's not on Steam was just hilarious. Oh, it's because they don't want us to put our
2478000	2482260	game on Steam. No, it's because you want to try to sell it exclusively on Origin. That's
2482260	2486640	really the deal, but you want to make Valve out to be the bad guy. Well, hold on, because
2486640	2492600	their complaint is that Valve wants to control the patching, and EA doesn't want that. EA
2492600	2496780	wants to control the patching. To really make a long story short is ultimately what it boils
2496780	2500300	down to, is that they don't want to have to push all their patches through Valve and get
2500300	2504080	approval from Valve. They want to be able to do it themselves. That's what it boils
2504080	2507600	down to. Yeah, but see, that doesn't make any sense until we know how hard the approval
2507600	2512800	process is for patching. If they're like, here's the patch, okay. I mean, it's just
2512800	2518960	an excuse is what it is. Going to our chatroom in the comments, Kaijuto says, I won't be
2518960	2523200	playing Battlefield 3 on PC. Zether says, fuck Battlefield 3, I'll play Battlefield
2523200	2528400	2 instead. Going back a little bit further, talking about Half-Life and all that, Tigerclaw
2528400	2532020	says, the source engine throughout the years has been getting massive upgrades with every
2532020	2536220	new game. Take Portal 2, for example. It runs on the source engine, and the graphics are
2536220	2541560	better than before. That's true. Tigerclaw also points out to the folks saying, fuck
2541560	2546760	Battlefield 3 on PC. A game like that was strictly made for PC in mind, then portaled
2546760	2554360	to the consoles. But see, you know, this whole requirement for Origin and stuff, that's just
2554360	2560800	right now. I mean, look at like, Portal 2 and stuff, or even on the other, like, Valve
2560800	2565480	products. You don't have to be connected to Steam, nor to play those on your PC. No, you
2565480	2573920	don't. So, I mean. Hackers will fix the problem, okay? They'll come and save the day, and that'll
2573920	2579300	be the end of that. I kinda like Steam. Their actions have shown that they're really trying
2579300	2584760	to be on the pulse of what gamers really want. Not what executives want for gamers, but what
2584760	2590500	gamers really want. I mean, the sales have been really kick-ass. This whole trading thing,
2590500	2595660	although it's a little weird, I like that they're even fucking going there. I mean,
2595660	2599560	I do not expect Origin or Games for Windows to be following this, what Valve's trying
2599560	2604560	to do here. And that's kinda part of the reason I'm a little loyal to Steam. They've shown,
2604560	2608480	they've really tried to push, like, what they're trying to do for privacy and security, and
2608480	2613720	to make sure all that stuff's locked down. Their DRM is restrictive enough without being
2613720	2617620	too restrictive. I mean, I don't wanna come off sounding like a fanboy, but I feel like
2617620	2623960	Steam's proven themselves where others have not. And that's basically what it boils down
2623960	2629520	to, right? Yeah. It's my money. Yeah. Prove to me you want it. Yeah. You're starting to
2629520	2639240	sound like what's-her-name in Portal 2, the Secretary. Burn his house down. Alright, anyhow.
2639240	2644040	Let's move on, DarkSakura. Away from the PCs for a little bit, right? How about some Wii
2644040	2651960	stuff? Wii, Wii! They have filed for a patent for the digital tablet. So basically there's
2651960	2661400	some information about that controller going on that says it basically has a magnetometer
2661400	2666600	in it, which is basically for motion control calibration. And it has the microphone, speaker,
2666600	2671300	and camera functions that are also included. There's actually a neat little diagram of
2671300	2678040	someone holding a Wiimote over it and using it as a, like playing golf with it. So using
2678040	2687940	it to sense where the Wiimote is in terms of the floor, I guess. But they're also saying
2687940	2695000	that it does have different IR modules and likely it's going to also include connectivity
2695000	2703720	with the 3DS. So. And it also says it's gonna be about as strong as the PS3 and the Xbox
2703720	2710160	360. I guess none of that is a huge surprise except that whole magnetometer? What do they
2710160	2719100	call that? A magnetometer. It's for calibration. It's powered by Magneto. It's like your little
2719100	2724440	pendulum in your pinball table. You know, you lean it too far, tilt. Well I think for
2724440	2729800	one to remember it's used for finding true north. It's for orientation. Why do I need
2729800	2734160	to find true north in my house? The PSP has them. What compass game would I be playing
2734160	2738320	in my house? Really the PSP? Why does the PSP? Well the PSP has GPS features, right?
2738320	2744160	Well the. I thought they do. It's in the move and it's going to be in the Vita. Yes it does.
2744160	2747520	Don't want to do the Japanese releases. There's usually some type of like navigation software
2747520	2752800	for the PSP. Yeah, they have an attachment for it. It's an extra accessory. It's going
2752800	2757760	to be for the Vita, but it's already in the move. Hmm. If it had GPS I'd probably be using
2757760	2762800	a lot more than there was. Fair enough. Well, I don't know. What do you think of the Wii
2762800	2767580	U developments? I mean, none of it's really too shocking. I guess it's neat that they're
2767580	2772200	trying to fill up the tablet with more stuff, but at the end of the day, show me the games.
2772200	2777280	I think it's all just going to be integrated into their whole immersive environment type
2777280	2781440	of thing. I really want to know what Nintendo's online thing's going to be. I almost think
2781440	2786420	it's going to be something like a handheld Kinect. It'll have the similar functionality
2786420	2790280	except it's going to use it in conjunction with the Wiimote. Hmm. Something like that.
2790280	2796040	I think their online's going to be terrible. Did you say turd-arable? I thought you were
2796040	2799440	going to say terraria and I was like, really? You're going to Minecraft your way on Nintendo
2799440	2805600	? I was making it seem like I was going to say terrific and then mid-word I changed it
2805600	2812280	to terrible. Therefore, being funny, adding humor to the word. I like turdrific. I'm going
2812280	2816560	to use turdrific from now on. Well, Loki, yet another failure of your humor on this
2816560	2823360	program. Hey, I considered excess myself, so failure, I do not see that. Just like the
2823360	2831640	3DS, it is a very successful product. It's not failing at all. Horse turds. I like turdrific.
2831640	2840720	I'll use that in a sentence three times today. Okay. Let's move on. More gaming news, Loki.
2840720	2849720	Guess what? PS3's got another firmware. Hurrah. 3.7, it brings fun stuff as auto cloud saves
2849720	2856080	and trophy syncing as well. However, in order to actually access any of these features,
2856080	2862240	you have to be a PlayStation Plus member. Eh, that's too bad. Yeah, some of the stuff
2862240	2866240	that they of course hinting at before when they were talking a little bit about PlayStation
2866240	2871640	Plus. Also, they've done some rearranging of their TV and video services. I guess that
2871640	2878000	will be added to the cross media bar now. And a new category will house online services
2878000	2883120	like Hulu and Netflix. So they're kind of tweaking some arrangement around. Moving your
2883120	2888120	stuff all around. And of course the undocumented features are they're signing stuff with new
2888120	2893920	codes now. Or new keys, I guess. Trying to prevent all the hacking and cracking behind
2893920	2901560	the scenes. Of course. I said trying. Yes, that is the key word, of course. Trying. I'm
2901560	2910440	sure somebody found a way around it in 24 hours. Yeah, they already have. Alright. Well,
2910440	2917480	I downloaded the firmware and I didn't really notice anything. Hurrah, I guess. I guess
2917480	2922320	I always expect maybe my games will suddenly be more fun. Patches don't ever really seem
2922320	2928240	to have that. Hey, Gamefly. You've probably heard of them. They're a pretty popular Netflixy
2928240	2934880	type of service for games. But this time, they're kind of going further in that direction
2934880	2941160	of Netflix where soon you'll be able to play the games on demand. It's a PC thing though.
2941160	2946160	It's unlimited PC play service. You know, they took over direct to drive some time ago
2946160	2950480	and this seems to be the next step of that. Gamefly says that they are talking to all
2950480	2954240	publishers about participating. Several have been signed but we're not announcing at this
2954240	2959660	time. In the unlimited PC play portion for Gamefly subscribers, we expect to have over
2959660	2963640	a hundred titles available for the beta launch but we'll be adding to the list constantly
2963640	2968840	and should have hundreds at the time of our holiday launch. So, I guess also some folks
2968840	2973520	are asking, well, then if they're going to have the PC thing only, will there be a plan
2973520	2978520	for Gamefly that is only PC? Kind of like how there's a Netflix streaming only plan.
2978520	2982300	Sean Spector, the co-founder of Gamefly said in response to that, we currently have no
2982300	2987180	plans to offer a digital only subscription as we believe the real value to gamers and
2987180	2991920	our members is our unique combination of console and digital PC game offerings. So in other
2991920	2997160	words, no, the plans aren't going to be any cheaper. So, I guess that's kind of cool.
2997160	3002900	I mean, I don't know. It kind of sounds like what GameTap used to be. Remember GameTap?
3002900	3006200	They're still around but they suck now. Like when they first came out, it was an interesting
3006200	3012120	concept but, yeah, then they got sold and not so great anymore. So, I guess it's kind
3012120	3017200	of neat that somebody's kind of trying to pick that up. I noticed this little demo screen
3017200	3021420	shot. I don't know if this was just mocked up by somebody but it has games like DC Universe
3021420	3023920	and so forth in there. Now, I can't see how it...
3023920	3025520	It's because they bought Direct Drive.
3025520	3028080	Oh, and that was some of the games that were on there?
3028080	3029080	Yeah.
3029080	3033880	Interesting. Well, it'd be kind of cool but if some of the games are playable infinitely
3033880	3037960	but, I don't know, I don't have my hopes up that it'll be much more than a lot of the
3037960	3043120	Flash games or really old games. You know, that's kind of what GameTap had which isn't
3043120	3047240	necessarily a bad thing. I mean, just because a game is old doesn't mean it's bad. One thing
3047240	3051080	I really liked about GameTap was that it had like all the old Ask Kings Quest games and
3051080	3055640	all the old Zort games and all of that. Sometimes there were some gems from years and years
3055640	3060320	ago that you might have missed. So, I don't know. We'll see how this plays out. It really
3060320	3062960	depends on what games and how much. We'll see.
3062960	3063960	DarkSakura.
3063960	3071360	Well, how about some news for the UK Nintendo 3DS price cut? This is basically just the
3071360	3079960	overall game revealed recently that they have a trade-in deal where if you trade in a DSi-XL
3079960	3088920	you can get a 3DS for £49.99 or with Zelda Ocarina of Time for £59.99. So, that's actually
3088920	3097200	a pretty decent deal. Also, the regular price of that is £159.99 bundled with Zelda Ocarina
3097200	3103680	of Time. Again, this is in British Pounds. If you trade in a DSi, you will get it for
3103680	3114000	£89.99. So, looking at the vendors overall, this is what you're looking for for the different
3114000	3122760	prices. Not all of them are gonna price match, but here's what we have. For Tesco, it's £115.
3122760	3130840	For Morrison's, £120. For ASDA, £134. For Sainsbury's, £140. Online, for Amazon it's
3130840	3139480	£115. Shop2 is £135. GameStop, £135. Gameplay, £135. And Play, £140. And then High Street
3139480	3147360	and Online, it says Toys R Us is £135. Currys is £140. Argos is £150. Game is £150, while
3147360	3154160	Online it's £140. And HMV is £150 and includes a free game. It's £140 online.
3154160	3156720	Just to kind of piggyback on that a little bit, if you want to know what's going on here
3156720	3162080	in the US, Target, honestly, started a system which I thought was weird because I didn't
3162080	3167680	really think of Target as buying your old systems. But apparently, Target, I guess it
3167680	3171440	was just this past weekend, so you might have already missed it, so sorry about that. But
3171440	3177200	I guess Target was accepting DS trade-ins as credit towards a 3DS, and Excel was worth
3177200	3185120	$100, a DSI was worth $75. So I guess my Target doesn't sell used games or any that I've seen.
3185120	3187320	Are there other Targets out there that are in the used game market now?
3187320	3190240	I haven't seen it unless they have a deal with another used game vendor.
3190240	3196200	That could be. Maybe they put them back in the, sell them back to a vendor that sells
3196200	3201920	those. I don't know. Interesting. So, keep your eye out on places like Target and so
3201920	3207160	forth here in the US because there will probably be other details like that soon. So, anyhow,
3207160	3210680	speaking of things to do at the game store, there's some release dates we've got to go
3210680	3216200	over around the world, and we'll start off with the US release dates. Loki?
3216200	3220440	Not a lot this week, of course, because, you know, this month's been the theme of the past
3220440	3224000	month. Yeah, pretty much. It's been slow. But at least there are some actual things
3224000	3228960	coming out. Starting off with No More Heroes Paradise, or No More Heroes Heroes Paradise
3228960	3235240	on the PlayStation 3. That's actually getting a budget price to it, which is kind of cool
3235240	3242120	because it was full price at one point. With move support as well, so you swing around
3242120	3251920	your lightsaber that way. And also, coming to Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, El Shaddai,
3251920	3258720	Ascension of the Metatron from Ignition. And a pretty cool-looking action game there. Very
3258720	3267240	abstract. That's on both those systems. Age of Empires Online on PC. Puzzler World 2 for
3267240	3277360	Nintendo DS. Emily the Strange Strangress on the Nintendo DS. And yeah, maybe this is
3277360	3283160	the problem with the Wii right here. Jerry Rice and Nidus Dog Football for the Nintendo
3283160	3287720	Wii. Fuck, that sounds awesome! I love the Puppy Bowl. That's like the best part of the
3287720	3290800	Super Bowl. Dog Football. The only good part of the Super Bowl. That's the only thing worth
3290800	3294800	watching is the Puppy Bowl. I could give two shits about the regular football game. The
3294800	3299560	Kitty Cat Halftime? Yes, Kitty Cat Halftime is what it's all about. Dog Football on the
3299560	3305320	Wii. That's an amazing release on the Wii. Why are you, why you gotta be rough on the
3305320	3313800	races? Don't forget to sip your waitress, everybody. Alright, reading some comments
3313800	3317900	in our chatroom. Going back a little bit to the story about the Target and all the price
3317900	3322320	deals on the DS and trade-ins and so forth. Mieglatov points out Best Buy is still doing
3322320	3327000	that deal. I haven't seen a Best Buy that does that either, that does the used games.
3327000	3331560	I guess they're doing it, but not any of the ones near here. Have you been into a Best
3331560	3337040	Buy that does used games? Not lately yet. No wait, I did see one. I saw one, so I guess
3337040	3342380	it is slowly coming out. So, there you go. Alright, anyhow, moving on to the Japanese
3342380	3348360	releases and what's coming out of there. On the Xbox 360, Dirt 3 comes out on the 25th
3348360	3353080	on the Xbox 360 and that's pretty much the only release you have to look forward to over
3353080	3362000	there. On the Playstation 3 on the 18th, there is Cho-Jigan Game Neptune. I don't even know,
3362000	3369160	what the heck is this? It's from Idea Factory and it is the evil witch Magicon is back and
3369160	3374620	game galio world falls into chaos. The shops ran out of business, the creators are starving
3374620	3380160	and most of the children are worshipping Magicon as a goddess. So what is this? This is a collaboration
3380160	3386080	between Gust, Nippon Ichi, 5BP, KI Concept, Idea Factory and Compile Heart. That's a lot
3386080	3390940	of, this is a huge crossover game I guess is what this is all about. Worlds collide
3390940	3396640	in this game. It looks a little RPG-ish. And that's a big release I guess on the Playstation
3396640	3401140	3. I don't think that's something we'll be getting over here. That's out on the 18th.
3401140	3409920	Going to the other systems in Japan, nothing to say yet on the Wii, but on the PSP, Amnesia,
3409920	3413920	I do not believe that is the same Amnesia that scares the shit out of people on the
3413920	3419520	PC here. There's a scary ass game on the PC called Amnesia that's in Steam and stuff.
3419520	3427400	It's not the same game. This is a artsy anime type of game that's available on the PSP.
3427400	3432480	And there's lots of kissing. Like look, they're making out, these two are going to make out
3432480	3435880	and he's probably dreaming about somebody making out with him. Like there's just lots
3435880	3441920	of kissy kissy in this game. Aww. That's an adventure game on the PSP if you like kissy
3441920	3448560	kissy stuff. Growlancer 4 Over Reloaded also comes out on the PSP this week. Boy there's
3448560	3453200	really just not a lot to get excited about right now. They're already on the fourth one?
3453200	3461020	Yes. Wow. That's it for Japanese releases. How about UK? A few. On the 17th we have Cubix
3461020	3469000	HD from Dust for PC from Ubisoft. Toy Soldier Civil War and on the 19th we have Xenoblade
3469000	3475320	Chronicles for Wii. That's it. There's no more. Hey, Xenoblade Chronicles might be of
3475320	3482160	interest to some people. A few, maybe. Alright, I wouldn't be surprised if some of the Operation
3482160	3488620	Rainfall people are like, ok, this week you have to buy a Wii system from the UK and buy
3488620	3497480	Xenoblade just to show that we want it here. Just wait for it. Moving on, more news. Couple
3497480	3500640	more news stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week coming up in just
3500640	3509240	a little bit here. So, a little more news about THQ. We talked last week how they weren't
3509240	3518400	too happy about their overall earnings for the second quarter. THQ of course is not going
3518400	3523280	to actively pursue development of the MX vs ATV franchise. So, it looks like it will also
3523280	3531280	be joining Red Faction as another franchise that's kind of run out of steam. They were
3531280	3538240	saying their latest game was kind of an experiment, although it was a failed experiment and unfortunately
3538240	3543680	releasing the title at a budget price didn't spur the extra sales they were hoping to make
3543680	3551720	up on the back end with DLC and it's kind of not a good thing. So, not going to continue
3551720	3561080	on with that franchise. Also, they've let go of 200 people and they're shifting their
3561080	3568640	development focus away from kids and licensed titles, which I got to admit, other than the
3568640	3573920	WWE games and the occasional Saints Row and stuff like that, they do a lot of fucking
3573920	3580640	kids games. You probably won't see the shift away from it this holiday because they have
3580640	3586160	a lot of fucking kids games coming out other than Saints Row and WWE. Lots of You Draw
3586160	3596320	stuff, lots of the Marvel Superhero Squad chibi Marvel stuff and Spongebob and all the
3596320	3604640	Nicktoons stuff. So, it's good that they're getting away from that. Oh, imagine that.
3604640	3611520	All those little shovelware games didn't do so well at the end of the day. Yeah, too bad.
3611520	3615360	Moving on to, I guess I was joking about this earlier, but we do have a story about the
3615360	3619400	whole Xenoblade and so forth. It is coming out, of course, in Europe very soon, as Dark
3619400	3625560	Sakura just said. Reggie Fils-Aime made a comment to IGN this week about Xenoblade Chronicles.
3625560	3629480	We will be watching very closely what happens in Europe. Certainly, if there are business
3629480	3633920	opportunities and positive consumer uptake from some of those titles, that will be great
3633920	3639480	data for us to consider as we look at what to do with these titles. Boy, if that's not
3639480	3644040	a run around the bush answer, if I've ever heard one, that's a I'm not fucking telling
3644040	3647720	you that the game is confirmed for here. I'm just going to bullshit you with some of that.
3647720	3654320	That was the biggest pound of bullshit I've ever heard. Something smells. Yeah, so whatever.
3654320	3659400	It's not Shermie's ass. Whatever. So it's the nicest possible way you can say, please
3659400	3663200	buy the game in Europe, but it doesn't mean we're going to put it out here. That pile
3663200	3672680	of bullshit was like 400 Keurig. Anyhow, Operation Rainfall. That doesn't stop Operation Rainfall.
3672680	3676160	They're not going to take no for an answer, not even for Reggie Fils-Aime, who didn't
3676160	3680680	really say no, but he didn't really say yes either. Operation Rainfall is starting phase
3680680	3686440	two. Kicking it up a notch. Oh no. We're stepping it up. We're going to get these fucking games
3686440	3693480	out here. So would this be considered plan B? Yes, this is plan B. So here's plan B.
3693480	3698420	It's going to coincide with the August 19th launch of Xenoblade Chronicles in Europe.
3698420	3702640	To all residents in the regions of Europe and Oceania, says the organizers of Operation
3702640	3707880	Rainfall, we encourage you to pre-order and purchase it at your earliest convenience.
3707880	3712480	In the Americas, we encourage you to promote awareness of these titles. Good sales abroad
3712480	3716780	will be a strong indicator for the title, making it to American shores. So, you know,
3716780	3720360	tell people in Europe to go buy the fucking game and buy it now. Don't buy it used, buy
3720360	3723880	it new so they get the sales, you know, try to sell a lot of copies of that game. Send
3723880	3728260	us a copy. Now, yeah, that's that. Hey, we'll take that. Buy one. Oh wait, we couldn't play
3728260	3732600	it on anything. Do you have a, do you have a, wait, oh, you have a region free. We don't
3732600	3742600	want you. Well, sort of fair enough. Um, also they're going to be sending a rally of letters
3742600	3747040	to Nintendo of America. You're supposed to mail them from August 13th to August 17th
3747040	3751060	so that they all get there about the same time. This kind of reminds me of when everybody
3751060	3756480	sent the peanuts to CBS to try and save Jericho. Like, but they're just sending letters like
3756480	3760940	you need, like you need to send something, you need to not just send a letter, you need
3760940	3765560	to send something with it. Like, you know, instead of peanuts, what's something that
3765560	3774500	they could send for Xenoblade? Switchblades, switchblades, box cutters. No, don't do that.
3774500	3780040	Don't do it now. We're just kidding. Don't do that. Good Lord. Like the shit. They will
3780040	3785060	look at you at the post office. Funny if you do that. Send them hand drawn pictures of
3785060	3791120	knives. No, don't do that. Don't do that. Um, let's see. What could, what could you
3791120	3795000	send? I have to turn that over to the chat room. That would remind somebody of Xenoblade
3795000	3800000	or I guess you could say the last story or Pandora's tower. Is there like some other
3800000	3806840	factor that makes a whole bunch of copies of Xenogears from PlayStation the best? I
3806840	3813220	don't know. Um, what about like letter Xs? Like they should cut out the letter X from
3813220	3817240	all their magazines and put them in an envelope so that when they open it up, just Xs fly
3817240	3829200	everywhere. And the X means Xenoblade. How about bees? No, cause the bees would fly everywhere.
3829200	3833560	It's a little more daring. All right, fine. I don't want to open the rest of those letters.
3833560	3840800	They're all buzzing over there. I just thought it was the one, but I'm pretty sure there's
3840800	3853040	bees in all of those. This package is buzzing and it's angry. Make it stop Reggie. Fine.
3853040	3856760	Send them bees. All right. I'm pretty sure bees wouldn't survive the trip though, but
3856760	3863880	uh, you could try the holes in the box. Oh, we're sending in a box. You can fill out bees
3863880	3871560	in a box. Don't send them bees. Just send them a jar of honey saying we were going to
3871560	3876200	send bees, but bees didn't want to stay in the box. Here's some honey instead. You know,
3876200	3882260	wasps, they're meaner. Hold on. No. Operation rainfall does not think you should send bees.
3882260	3887240	They say you should send letters and they've also posted an open letter to Satoru Wata.
3887240	3890760	Here's what you need to do. If you want to just beat the shit out of a water right now,
3890760	3895920	buy Nintendo stock and then complain as an investor. That's what you need to do. If you
3895920	3899800	really want to kick Nintendo in the balls right now, become an investor of Nintendo
3899800	3905040	stock and then say, as an investor, I feel that you need to bring Xenoblade out of here.
3905040	3911360	The stock prices keep dropping, so it's going to be cheap real soon. Okay, now the chat
3911360	3916880	room has a great suggestion. Send them porn because when you think X, it's X, X, X. Yeah,
3916880	3926280	that's not going to work. Send them porn. Send them. What is it? Frisbee in chat says
3926280	3933400	each one of these things is how you make us feel. Sorry. Cause you know, I'm thinking
3933400	3937840	of that gift that's out there on the internet. The animated gift file of Oprah opening the
3937840	3944480	box. It says bees. It was on the Conan show. Tiger cloth. Find me that GIF posted in chats.
3944480	3948640	Even better issues. You send it like the Riddler. You know how the Riddler would send you a
3948640	3953240	little boxes, question marks on, but they have a box with a question mark on it in the
3953240	3958280	Mario universe. It fits like that with the bees. That's good. Or you can have the treasure
3958280	3969000	chest from Zelda. So when they open it, it's like, doo, doo, doo, doo, bees. And then the
3969000	3974040	note says each of these things is how you make us feel or bees in a jar. Just like,
3974040	3980840	you know, Zelda, it's all, I'm really going with the bees here. I think the bees are really
3980840	3985240	good. They keep sending bees, throw them in the fountain and see if you get super bees,
3985240	3990520	super bees. All right, look, there's more to this story. Shut up about the bees already.
3990520	3996520	All right. On August 19th, there's one more big thing that operation rainfall is going
3996520	4002720	to be doing. You're ready as a show of an interest in RPGs. Everybody on August 19th
4002720	4010240	should purchase Final Fantasy on Virtual Console. But if you already have it, you should give
4010240	4015960	the money to somebody else or donate to Child's Play, which I'm not going to make fun of that
4015960	4020840	idea. I think donating to Child's Play is always a good idea. I'm not quite sure how
4020840	4026120	that gets the point across that you want Xenoblade, but okay, whatever gets you to donate to a
4026120	4031480	good charity. That's fine. As far as buying Final Fantasy on the Virtual Console, I think
4031480	4036160	your money might just be better spent giving the money to Child's Play in the name of bringing
4036160	4044160	Xenoblade to the Wii. Like, how is buying Final Fantasy on Virtual Console and increasing
4044160	4052480	Square Enix's coffers going to prove to Reggie that we want Xenoblade? I don't, like, Loki,
4052480	4055480	can you help explain this to me? Because I'm not understanding.
4055480	4071080	Well, they have blades in both of them, and Square Enix made Xenogears, and it's a terrible
4071080	4078040	idea. Because you know what's going to happen? Because once again, this is the problem. Yes,
4078040	4084480	there's lots of people on forums, lots of people on forums, that are complaining that
4084480	4092240	Xenoblade is not coming to the United States. But lots of people on forums also said, Mad
4092240	4096840	World is a fucking awesome game and I'm going to buy it. See, that's the problem. People
4096840	4104240	on forums, you know what your numbers are, right? You're not 100,000. You're not maybe
4104240	4105240	even 10,000.
4105240	4108920	And most people that post on forums that say they're going to buy it don't really buy it.
4108920	4111160	They end up pirating it, or borrowing it from a friend.
4111160	4117080	There are maybe a few thousand people that want this game. And I'm sorry, a game that
4117080	4124480	only sells a few thousand copies is a failure. So, it's just not going to happen. You know
4124480	4130680	what? Just save your money, save your time, wait for E3 next year, and maybe they'll announce
4130680	4134120	it. But in the meantime, if you really do want to spend, like, I don't know how much
4134120	4140200	it is for Final Fantasy 7 bucks, you can buy a lot of bees for $7. I'm telling you. I think
4140200	4143520	it's a great idea. And you know what? Hey, okay, fine. If you don't want to send them
4143520	4147680	live bees, because that might be a terrorist attack or a terror threat or something like
4147680	4150200	that, you know how they're all insensitive about that kind of...
4150200	4151740	But bees pollinate!
4151740	4155680	You can send them, like, a chocolate-covered... They don't sell chocolate-covered bees, I
4155680	4156680	would imagine.
4156680	4157680	I know. I know.
4157680	4159960	Maybe, like, uh...
4159960	4160960	Pictures of bees?
4160960	4168240	You know, send them Mario with his head cut off. I don't know. Just... Here's what you
4168240	4173880	need to do. Spend that $10 or whatever that you would have spent on, you know, Final Fantasy
4173880	4175760	or whatever. Just...
4175760	4178480	And donate it to charity and know that your money went to something good.
4178480	4183480	Or go buy lunch. Or go, like, go just, you know, rent a porno or something like that.
4183480	4188760	Fucking chill the fuck out. Because you're, like, getting all up in arms about, like,
4188760	4194480	some one damn game. Oh, these are the best games on the Wii! The best RPGs! The Wii is
4194480	4199600	over, okay? The Wii is done. It's pretty much done. It's... You're just, like, trying to
4199600	4203640	get this last good game out before the Wii is done. It's done, okay? They're going on
4203640	4209200	to the Wii U. So just get over it. Better games are out there. Better games will be
4209200	4213760	coming out there. So they didn't bring a hardcore game to the Wii, even though they said, oh,
4213760	4215560	we're catering to everybody.
4215560	4220640	Just get over it. They don't care about you. They don't care what you want. Otherwise,
4220640	4224080	you know what Earthbound would be out? You know, Earthbound 3 or Mother 3 or whatever
4224080	4228400	the fuck that is. That would be out here in some form. They don't give a shit because
4228400	4234080	they know, in the end, that a few thousand people arguing on forums about this is just
4234080	4238520	a few thousand people and not a hundred thousand or multiple hundreds of thousands of people
4238520	4239960	that are going to buy this game.
4239960	4247080	Dark Tetsuya points out, you know, Mario did have a bee power-up in Mario Galaxy.
4247080	4250480	So you see, right there, Nintendo loves bees. And I think that...
4250480	4255080	All right. I'm going to end this conversation on a comment that's about as good as this
4255080	4256080	whole effort.
4256080	4257080	Wait, wait, wait.
4257080	4258080	What?
4258080	4262160	If you don't like bees because they fly around, you know, and that might be a little...
4262160	4263160	It might be hard to catch.
4263160	4265920	It may be hard to catch. Scorpions also work.
4265920	4268960	Stop it. All right. I'm going to end on this comment from our chat room.
4268960	4272440	You can get candy-covered scorpions. Those are safe.
4272440	4278880	Spazinator says, Nintendo would boil the bees to make a bee tea. I heard bee tea makes for
4278880	4280840	a good buzz.
4280840	4288000	Just going to let that joke settle for a minute.
4288000	4293440	Let's go to the classic game of the week.
4293440	4297240	Every week here on Orange Lounge, Rito Dark Sakura dives into the gaming vault and finds
4297240	4298240	the bee.
4298240	4301840	Whoa, whoa, hold on. Before we start, Break Man says, so Loki thinks trying to hurt the
4301840	4305220	developers is a better idea than trying to bribe them.
4305220	4308280	We're not saying it to the developers. We're saying it to Nintendo. They're not the developers.
4308280	4309280	We're not trying to hurt them.
4309280	4312360	The developers are far away, safe from the bees.
4312360	4315440	All right, sorry.
4315440	4320560	By the way, I believe Dark Sakura posted that gif on Tumblr for those that are listening
4320560	4322040	on the podcast.
4322040	4323040	I did.
4323040	4327240	I like having the Tumblr, so when funny shit comes up on the show, we can talk about it
4327240	4328240	on Tumblr.
4328240	4329240	Yes.
4329240	4332280	Oh, remove that thing that cross posts everything to Twitter, though.
4332280	4334040	I don't think I ever set that up.
4334040	4337760	It's doing it. See if you can find it. All right.
4337760	4338760	Classic game of the week.
4338760	4339760	Yay.
4339760	4344120	Dark Sakura goes in the classic gaming vault, finds the game. She thinks, hey, you kids
4344120	4346000	ought to be playing it this week.
4346000	4351000	Forget the last story. This is the only story you fucking need.
4351000	4353360	Dark Sakura, what is the classic game of the week this week?
4353360	4356320	Warcraft III, Reign of Chaos.
4356320	4357320	Addict.
4357320	4363360	No, not really, because I don't like real-time strategy games, but I'm trying to play it.
4363360	4368600	I'm trying to, so I thought I would bring it up.
4368600	4371160	This is, of course, the third in a row.
4371160	4376160	The first one was Warcraft Orcs and Humans, and the second one was Tides of Darkness,
4376160	4379160	and this one's Reign of Chaos.
4379160	4380160	Oops, sorry.
4380160	4386160	The music one that I put up there is actually from the expansion, The Frozen Throne.
4386160	4387160	Okay.
4387160	4394960	So, yeah, it did come out, and it actually was released on July 3rd, 2002, and it's the
4394960	4400560	second sequel to, as I said, Warcraft Orcs and Humans.
4400560	4405360	It had an expansion pack called The Frozen Throne that came out on July 1st, 2003.
4405360	4407560	So you have four playable races this time.
4407560	4414800	You have Orcs and Humans, and you also have Night Elves and Undead, and it's sort of laid
4414800	4418300	out like Starcraft.
4418300	4422080	You also have other races in the expansion.
4422080	4430560	You get the Draenei and the Naga, who are really elves, but they suck.
4430560	4436440	Anyway, you've got multiplayer, you can play on the internet, you can do, you can play
4436440	4443960	against the computer, you can even later on mod your levels and do customized level layouts
4443960	4445400	and map changes and everything.
4445400	4447200	It's pretty cool.
4447200	4454120	And the proper story lines, basically, is if you've done the Orc campaign on Warcraft
4454120	4459000	and the Human campaigns on Warcraft, actually both Warcraft II, so that would be Tides of
4459000	4464200	Darkness and Beyond the Dark Portal, then those lead into Warcraft III.
4464200	4472160	So it sold 4.5 million units, a little ship, I should say, and it sold over a million within
4472160	4477040	a month, and it is one of the game beer ones listed.
4477040	4481800	So basically, it's a, you know, like I said, real-time strategy.
4481800	4486440	You have this stuff called the Black Mask that covers places that you haven't explored,
4486440	4490040	but when you explore, it goes away, but if you move too far away, then you get the Fog
4490040	4496720	of War, which makes, um, you can't see what troops are doing and what building construction
4496720	4499960	is going on, though you can still see the terrain.
4499960	4505920	I call that saving space for, you know, rendering, but that's another story.
4505920	4508280	Um, so you have to get your different resources.
4508280	4516080	You need gold, lumber, and food, and you have to have those to make buildings, and the food
4516080	4519960	determines the number of units you can control at any given time, so basically the more troops
4519960	4522560	you can feed, the more you can have out in play.
4522560	4527080	You also have creeps, which are controlled by the computer, and they guard different
4527080	4532840	areas like gold mines and buildings, um, you can kill them for gold, experience, and special
4532840	4539720	items, and you have a day-night cycle that was also introduced for this game.
4539720	4546320	Um, at the night, the creeps fall asleep, so nighttime scouting at night is safer, but
4546320	4550120	you also have reduced line of sight, that type of thing, so it's got different things
4550120	4551120	going on.
4551120	4558480	And according now that it has 3D terrain, um, you've got other line of sight, uh, limitations
4558480	4560400	as well.
4560400	4564720	So with this one, you also get something called heroes.
4564720	4569960	So when you have an enemy unit killed, your hero will gain experience points and can level
4569960	4577320	up as far as 10, and they also get new spells, kind of gets like an RPG element to it, and
4577320	4582160	they can, uh, boost their units that way, and they'll get ULTIMATE SKILLS!
4582160	4585960	So basically, you've got your different campaign modes, you've got five campaigns, including
4585960	4591520	the prologue, that introduces the different, uh, race, um, races.
4591520	4596120	There's two orc campaigns, one human, one undead, and one night elf, and they have different
4596120	4601640	chapters which are kind of like your missions, and, uh, but you do not have briefings as
4601640	4603600	you did in the earlier games.
4603600	4610200	It just sort of comes out in a series of quests, and, uh, the story unfolds through cinematics
4610200	4615880	and cutscenes, and you get your different objectives as you progress through the game.
4615880	4618840	Kind of like how World of Warcraft is doing now.
4618840	4624880	You know, it seems to me it's exactly, you know, a good transition.
4624880	4634520	So anyway, um, it's, you have different patterns, like you have a building mission, and then
4634520	4638600	you have to maintain your base, and then fight the enemy.
4638600	4642840	The night elf ones are a little bit different, um, because they have just a limited base,
4642840	4647720	but then they have epic battles, ooh, and of course there's multiplayer, you know, so
4647720	4651360	you can go against your friends and other people on battle net.
4651360	4657540	You had different, uh, gateways, um, you had your Azeroth, which was east, um, the eastern
4657540	4658540	US.
4658540	4664760	Leuridron, which was the, um, the west United States, northward for Europe, and Kalimdor
4664760	4666240	for Asia.
4666240	4672560	So you could, uh, actually play anonymously with other people.
4672560	4678800	It's called matchmaking, ooh, so you could have different battles against random people.
4678800	4684720	And then, um, there were also, uh, scores and standings that were marked on the ladder.
4684720	4688800	So as far as the game goes, I'm not gonna tell too much of the story, um, I prefer to
4688800	4691080	paraphrase it as Arthas is a bitch.
4691080	4692960	Don't you think?
4692960	4695960	Yeah, about sums it up.
4695960	4702440	Arthas decides he's gonna get all big and bad, and, uh, burn a bunch of people to death,
4702440	4707320	and then get some sword and give his soul up for his sword, and then become, uh, the
4707320	4708320	Lich King's bitch.
4708320	4715240	And, uh, and then he does a whole bunch of awful shit, like, you know, killing his dad,
4715240	4720560	and killing a bunch of other people, and turning Sylvanas into, you know, a banshee, and all
4720560	4722240	kinds of other crap.
4722240	4727800	So yeah, it's, it's basically Arthas is a bitch, the game.
4727800	4733960	Um, but you also find a few, or a few people that went to MIA in earlier games, what happened
4733960	4734960	to them.
4734960	4739720	And, of course, for anyone who's playing World of Warcraft now, uh, you know, pretty much
4739720	4746040	all these characters that were in this game play into, um, you, you can find them in World
4746040	4751360	of Warcraft, or they've been dead and are affecting the game, but it's all built on
4751360	4753400	what went on in this game.
4753400	4758800	Um, it has great sound, you could actually, if you got the limited edition, it came with
4758800	4759800	the soundtrack.
4759800	4765200	Uh, there were different types of, uh, you know, music for the different, uh, races,
4765200	4771400	like the one that I just, we were just hearing was the night elf theme, which is pretty good
4771400	4772400	music.
4772400	4773400	Um...
4773400	4776520	It's at the end though, so I'm gonna switch to the undead music.
4776520	4777520	Okay.
4777520	4784600	So, uh, and like I said, you could also, um, there was a world editor that you could change
4784600	4786400	different events and change different things.
4786400	4791920	You could download each other's maps, and, uh, there were also third party developing,
4791920	4795540	uh, developers that had different tools that came out, like different spreadsheets and
4795540	4799360	customizing skins, all kinds of different cool stuff.
4799360	4807000	So, uh, basically the game, um, there was this, like, epic bundle that came with, uh,
4807000	4813680	the soundtrack and structure manual, the art of warcraft book and lithographic prints,
4813680	4819120	and, um, you could also get the battle chest, which had reign of chaos with the frozen throne
4819120	4822080	inbox, and the guides from brady games.
4822080	4827360	There's also an exclusive gift set that had a cinematic DVD, and a bunch of other crap.
4827360	4833880	And, uh, there was also, uh, for anyone who played warcraft the board game, it actually
4833880	4837680	was based heavily off of warcraft 3.
4837680	4847160	It got a 93.09% at game rank rankings dot com, and basically it's just considered one
4847160	4852800	of the greatest game, I'd say modern games of all time, so, there you go.
4852800	4858120	Alright, there it is folks, your classic game of the week, warcraft 3.
4858120	4859720	Arthas is a bitch.
4859720	4863160	Arthas is a bitch, and as salaciouspop says in chat, Arthas is a bitch, and Illidan needs
4863160	4865280	to stop listening to Linkin Park.
4865280	4866280	Yes!
4866280	4870720	There you go, alright that's gonna do it for part A here of Orange Lounge Radio, but don't
4870720	4874440	go anywhere guys, we've got plenty more to come of the show tonight, we're gonna move
4874440	4878760	into part B, talk a little bit about Google+, more Nintendo news, and of course mailbag,
4878760	4889440	FUs, tweets, and calls, all when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4889440	4894320	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, we are live of course on this Sunday evening,
4894320	4901000	August the 14th of 2011, with the 424th episode of our show, taping live at All Games Radio,
4901000	4906600	www.allgames.com, you missed a fun part A that was full of Bs, but we are gonna continue
4906600	4911280	on with part B of our show right now, and we're gonna start off with some rapid fire
4911280	4912280	news.
4912280	4913280	Loki.
4913280	4914280	This game is hard.
4914280	4915280	Anyways.
4915280	4916280	What game?
4916280	4917520	Oh you're still playing VVVVVV over there right?
4917520	4920600	Yes, I had to dodge the lies.
4920600	4927460	So this is interesting, Kojima of course during his podcast, they had done a Snatcher Universe
4927460	4936220	radio drama, which was I guess entitled Suda 51's Sedature, and it's now being offered
4936220	4940880	as a free download, and if you want something a little bit more physical, you can get a
4940880	4946760	CD that will be sold later on, I guess to pay the voice actors, and I guess the voice
4946760	4950960	drama also featured a lot of the people that did voices in Metal Gear, so that's kinda
4950960	4953240	cool.
4953240	4959280	And so yeah, check that out, and if you're looking for more information on that, I believe
4959280	4969520	you can just check out his actual podcast, it's www.KJP.Konami.JP, and I think it's the
4969520	4972880	Hideo blog on there.
4972880	4980520	Motorstorm Apocalypse is getting a brand new update, and they're adding mode support, which
4980520	4986920	I guess allows you to customize the vehicles, and some of the other options that are in
4986920	4989160	the game.
4989160	4996120	You can tweak everything including, that's awesome, you can disable brakes, you can disable
4996120	4997120	gravity.
4997120	5000440	Sweet, a racing game with no brakes.
5000440	5004840	It sounds kinda cool, so I'd have to check that out.
5004840	5010800	They also added PlayStation Move support for I guess if you wanted to do the ol' Wii steering
5010800	5018100	type thing on there, I don't know if I'd recommend that, but you know, the options there at least.
5018100	5023880	So that's out there now, so just connect to the internet and pop in the game.
5023880	5027360	And then Child of Eden unfortunately has been delayed a week, but I think it's kinda cool
5027360	5032280	because they're getting 3D support now, so you'll be able to check out the game September
5032280	5033280	27th.
5033280	5034960	It's PlayStation 3 though, right?
5034960	5037040	The PlayStation 3 version, yes, 360.
5037040	5041440	And of course it will feature Move controls as well, which to be honest I think that's
5041440	5045760	gonna be way better than what the Kinect was, so I would be kinda curious to check it out
5045760	5051680	on the PS3, but 3D man, I can only imagine that game, it's gonna be just amazing.
5051680	5058480	Yeah it's gonna be kind of a trip in 3D, so do I know anyone with a 3D TV and a PlayStation
5058480	5059480	3?
5059480	5061120	I can't think of anyone off the top of my head.
5061120	5063960	3D televisions haven't exactly cracked into the mainstream.
5063960	5067480	We have one in my work that's actually a Sony TV.
5067480	5071560	I've really contemplated getting one of those monitors though, I'm not gonna lie.
5071560	5073600	They're pretty decent, I mean it's about that big.
5073600	5078760	Yeah it's, you know, for gaming like in a little office or bedroom or something it would
5078760	5083880	be pretty good, good enough, so I gotta say I'm curious.
5083880	5088560	Alright, one of the games I might check out on the PlayStation 3 is the Metal Gear Solid
5088560	5089880	HD collection.
5089880	5095200	Hideo Kojima talked about on Twitter this week some of the differences between the region
5095200	5100040	releases, I'm not sure why, but the Japanese version of the game will not include Metal
5100040	5102200	Gear Solid Peace Walker.
5102200	5106360	It will have a download code however for the first Metal Gear Solid, I don't believe it's
5106360	5109960	uprezzed or anything like that though, it's just pretty much the original PlayStation
5109960	5110960	game.
5110960	5114400	Now the overseas version, which would include the one that's gonna come out in America,
5114400	5118660	it will not have the download for the first Metal Gear Solid, but it will have the HD
5118660	5119840	version of Peace Walker.
5119840	5123440	So I don't know why the difference is, but there you go.
5123440	5128760	Also of note, Metal Gear Solid 3 HD is going to be the subsistence version of the game.
5128760	5132000	It has the user control camera and all that stuff.
5132000	5137680	It also has emulated MSX versions of Metal Gear 1 and 2.
5137680	5141160	That's pretty awesome, because that was all, the subsistence versions of Metal Gear Solid
5141160	5143640	3 had that, so that's pretty rad.
5143640	5148000	I don't know if that means that we'll see them here in America, because those games
5148000	5152440	were never translated to English, because the MSX was never out in America, so I don't
5152440	5153440	know how that's all gonna work.
5153440	5154440	It's gonna be very interesting.
5154440	5159320	I really hope we can play those games in their original MSX format.
5159320	5162440	Keep in mind, oh by the way, there's a huge difference between Metal Gear 2 and Snake's
5162440	5164440	Revenge, by the way, if you didn't know that.
5164440	5169840	Snake's Revenge was completely done in America, and Kojima was not involved with that at all.
5169840	5175900	But there was an official Metal Gear 2, I'm not talking Solid, Metal Gear 2 on the MSX,
5175900	5177200	oh so many years ago.
5177200	5178200	We never saw it here.
5178200	5179200	There are fan translations.
5179200	5184020	Maybe, well I don't think they'd use a fan translation, but I would, man, I really hope
5184020	5185960	the MSX versions show up, but we'll see.
5185960	5192840	Anyhow, Metal Gear Solid 2 HD release would also be based on Subsistence, I guess he really
5192840	5196200	meant to say the substance version of the game, because there wasn't a Subsistence,
5196200	5197200	but whatever.
5197200	5198200	I don't know-
5198200	5199200	No, what's Subsistence?
5199200	5200200	Subsistence.
5200200	5201200	Was it?
5201200	5202200	Yeah.
5202200	5203200	Well, whatever.
5203200	5207920	Anyhow, those games will be in HD, and we'll have all the trophy support and all that good
5207920	5208920	stuff.
5208920	5212400	A game that you might have forgot about, but it's still coming, you know, eventually, Sonic
5212400	5214000	4, Episode 2.
5214000	5217640	Remember, because there was Sonic 4, Episode 1, and it kind of came out, and the whole
5217640	5219520	internet was all, no one cur.
5219520	5224160	A lot of people thought that Sonic 4 was pretty much dead, now that Sonic Generations is kind
5224160	5225920	of going, and so forth.
5225920	5230480	But nope, Sega West CEO Mike Hayes said that new info regarding the second chapter should
5230480	5233640	be out soon.
5233640	5236080	No more info, no date, just soon.
5236080	5239480	Just basically saying, hey, the game hasn't fallen off the radar, it will come out, you
5239480	5240960	know, eventually.
5240960	5245640	He did mention that Episode 1 did get a million downloads across all the platforms, so it
5245640	5247880	didn't do that bad.
5247880	5252080	A game that should have done a hell of a lot better than it did was Rock Band 3, and a
5252080	5254240	company is taking a second chance on the game.
5254240	5259800	Because, you know, I guess MTV Games isn't really around anymore, so you can't really
5259800	5261960	get new Rock Band 3.
5261960	5270000	Well, Mad Catz is going to be basically re-releasing Rock Band 3 this holiday, with their peripherals.
5270000	5274480	It's a really weird type of thing to see a company come in and pick up a game for a re-release
5274480	5275480	like that.
5275480	5276720	Yeah, but they did the official peripherals.
5276720	5281760	Yeah, but they're doing now the release of the game, which I think is kind of interesting.
5281760	5282760	By the way-
5282760	5284320	Well, they distributed the keyboard game bundles.
5284320	5285320	Oh, they did, that's right.
5285320	5288680	They did do the keyboard game bundles, so interesting.
5288680	5294720	They will be doing, though, the guitar controller version and the drum kit version.
5294720	5299860	They are, however, saying that so far the 360 is the only platform that the re-releases
5299860	5301160	are confirmed for.
5301160	5305760	They haven't said anything about the Wii or the PlayStation 3, so that part's kind of
5305760	5306760	interesting.
5306760	5310220	But you may see a resurgence of that game this holiday season, which is, you know, good.
5310220	5313720	If you never picked up Rock Band 3 and you like music games at all, you really should
5313720	5315200	check it out.
5315200	5316760	Going over to Dark Sakura.
5316760	5322800	Well, for fans of SingStar, there is a new version to be coming out, calling SingStar
5322800	5326160	Back to the 80s, and it'll be out sometime before Christmas.
5326160	5328000	Has 30 massive hits.
5328000	5333780	Now, I gotta ask, is it gonna have the song Back to the 80s?
5333780	5334780	Like by Aqua?
5334780	5335780	Yeah.
5335780	5336780	And I doubt it.
5336780	5337780	That wasn't an 80s song.
5337780	5338780	But it'd be cool, though.
5338780	5339780	It might be-
5339780	5341560	But it's gonna have Whitesnake and Devo.
5341560	5344240	It might be for sale on the SingStore.
5344240	5346480	It may be Meatloaf.
5346480	5348920	It better have Meatloaf.
5348920	5349920	What's for dinner?
5349920	5351480	Meatloaf, not again.
5351480	5354480	Also, for Rock Band, we have a new pack.
5354480	5359200	We have the Fall Out Boy Pack 1 with Dance Dance, Sugar We're Going Down, and Thanks
5359200	5360200	for the Memers.
5360200	5363160	Thanks for the Memers?
5363160	5366160	It's Memories, but they decided to spell it like, I don't know.
5366160	5368400	I know, but I like trying to say Memers.
5368400	5371400	Cool kids don't use letters, Dark Sakura.
5371400	5372400	Vowels.
5372400	5373400	LOL.
5373400	5377120	And then individually, we have Child in Time by Deep Purple.
5377120	5381700	And actually, for Sugar We're Going Down, there will be a Pro Guitar Bass expansion
5381700	5384920	available for 80 Microsoft points.
5384920	5394960	And moving forward, we have for North America on September 9th, the Flame Red 3DS will be
5394960	5395960	out.
5395960	5396960	It's flaming.
5396960	5397960	Yes, it is.
5397960	5400480	Actually, I like-
5400480	5405280	There was a DS in that exact same color, wasn't there?
5405280	5408240	I like the name in Japan, that was Flare Red.
5408240	5410080	I think that's kind of cool.
5410080	5412920	But anyway, it's a 3DS, and it's red and black.
5412920	5414160	The end.
5414160	5416560	All right.
5416560	5420960	By the way, guys, before we get back into some more long-form news, I do want to give
5420960	5425200	one more shout-out for the Indie Game Spotlight that we're going to be doing on the show.
5425200	5428040	Haven't had a whole lot of bites on that, so I don't know, I guess we must not have
5428040	5431960	a lot of developers listen to the show, but again, if you or a friend are developing an
5431960	5441840	independently produced game, either for iOS, PC, Xbox Live Arcade, or pretty much anything,
5441840	5446320	we'll take a look at it, and maybe invite you on the show to talk about it, and hopefully
5446320	5447320	get you noticed.
5447320	5450320	Because right now, one of the biggest bitches we're hearing about that is, it's really hard
5450320	5454600	to get noticed on Xbox Live Arcade, because A, Microsoft doesn't really highlight a lot
5454600	5458260	of the indie stuff, and B, a lot of it is crap.
5458260	5460800	There's a lot of crap out there, but there are a few good things.
5460800	5464800	And if you believe you have a diamond in the rough, we want to call it out here on this
5464800	5465800	program.
5465800	5468040	So, coming soon to the program.
5468040	5471320	And if we don't get a lot of developers to bite on that, we'll just kind of start spotlighting
5471320	5472920	stuff we like.
5472920	5473920	And that's where we'll go with it.
5473920	5477760	Because we're committed to helping indie games get more acknowledgement.
5477760	5480760	Because after all, we're an indie podcast, and we know it can be tough.
5480760	5485960	Also, I want to give a plug, speaking of indie podcasts, to another show that we do here
5485960	5487960	at OLR Network.
5487960	5494120	It is Hoard House, the best little Hoard House in Azeroth, www.hoardhouse.com.
5494120	5499140	If you like World of Warcraft, there's all sorts of fun stuff about WoW on that program.
5499140	5501500	This week, especially, was a really fun show.
5501500	5503460	We taped on an off day this week.
5503460	5506360	We had a guy from Britain on the show, and it was fun.
5506360	5508360	Rice Princess crashed the show about halfway through.
5508360	5511080	I guess, she's not Rice Princess anymore, I'm supposed to call her Irene.
5511080	5512680	She'll always be Rice Princess to me.
5512680	5516240	She crashed the show about halfway through, and we were talking about PVP for a little
5516240	5517240	while.
5517240	5518240	It was cool.
5518240	5519240	Good show.
5519240	5520240	Let's check it out.
5520240	5521640	Is she having withdrawals?
5521640	5525080	It doesn't sound like it, but it was still nice to have her perspective, even though
5525080	5528120	she's pretty comfortable in her decision to quit.
5528120	5531440	But I think, you know what's funny is that most people that were on the show this week
5531440	5535600	are on a bit of hiatus, but all of them were like, yeah, I'll come back eventually.
5535600	5539720	And even Pete Caruno, who is our guest over from overseas, is like, I'm on a trial account
5539720	5541480	right now, because it's free to play at a 20.
5541480	5544640	He's like, I'm doing the free to play thing right now, and I rolled a rogue over on the
5544640	5547300	US servers, just because I can.
5547300	5548300	So that was cool.
5548300	5549960	I've got a friend of mine playing now.
5549960	5551100	Oh, cool.
5551100	5555200	He's like, this is like fourth edition D&D, I like it.
5555200	5556260	You would say that.
5556260	5558520	So Hoardhouse.com, if you want to check that out.
5558520	5560840	Yes, we're still working on a third podcast.
5560840	5566760	Things just got slowed down because IRL trips and things, but more information on that soon.
5566760	5568680	I was also a guest on Girls Gone Wow.
5568680	5569680	Oh, yes.
5569680	5572000	Please plug that, because I'm supposed to be on that show next week.
5572000	5573000	Yes.
5573000	5576160	And they said that Extrofer is welcome to participate.
5576160	5580000	Yes, I've got to remember to talk to him about that.
5580000	5581000	The taping time.
5581000	5582000	Yes.
5582000	5583000	Because he'll probably be down.
5583000	5586120	GirlsGoneWow.net is their site?
5586120	5587200	I believe so.
5587200	5590120	It's not.com, because I think you get something else if you go there.
5590120	5591120	It's.net.
5591120	5596200	But they are lovely people, and they thank you for the biscuits.
5596200	5597200	Awesome.
5597200	5598200	Yes, it's.net.
5598200	5599200	GirlsGoneWow.net.
5599200	5600200	So check them out.
5600200	5604400	I was on episode 25, and Rob will be on episode 26.
5604400	5605400	Hooray.
5605400	5606400	All right.
5606400	5607400	Lots of Warcraft stuff.
5607400	5608400	We also had a little bit of Doctor Who discussion.
5608400	5610400	We do more than Warcraft, I promise.
5610400	5611400	Oh, really?
5611400	5612400	Yeah.
5612400	5613400	Fun.
5613400	5614400	It came up a little bit.
5614400	5615400	Fun.
5615400	5616400	All right.
5616400	5617400	The new show has nothing to do with Warcraft.
5617400	5618400	In fact, it's very much not about Warcraft.
5618400	5619400	I'll say that much.
5619400	5621840	If Dan's involved, it's not about Warcraft.
5621840	5622840	Exactly.
5622840	5623840	All right.
5623840	5627840	Let's get back into some more long-form news, and Loki's going to start us off.
5627840	5628840	Yes, I am.
5628840	5631280	I want to take a break here from this game.
5631280	5632280	You and that VVVVVVV.
5632280	5634880	Hey, I'm getting pretty far.
5634880	5640200	So Google Plus has started doing some games, and this is not a big surprise.
5640200	5642160	We kind of knew this was going to happen.
5642160	5646320	And of course, their rollout is a little bit like what we thought.
5646320	5653020	They're going to have a separate game section, so you can play your games, and all the updates
5653020	5658780	for those games are on one section, and they don't clutter up your feed or whatever.
5658780	5665740	So of course, they're going to start off with Angry Birds, Dragon Age Legends, Sodoku, stuff
5665740	5667320	of that sort.
5667320	5669280	And you can check it out.
5669280	5671680	They're going to be starting to roll out some more stuff.
5671680	5675320	Yes, in the great Google tradition, not everybody had it right away.
5675320	5678160	I got mine the day after this was announced, though.
5678160	5681040	So I played Bejeweled Blitz on Google Games.
5681040	5684320	I guess I forgot to say it at the top of the show, but I played Bejeweled Blitz on Google
5684320	5685320	Games.
5685320	5689760	So I have to say, I love that the game stuff is just on a separate frickin' page.
5689760	5696520	And it sounds like that they're trying to be a little bit more of a destination for
5696520	5702040	these developers, because they're offering, the commissions that they're taking from these
5702040	5704440	games are a lot less than, say, Facebook.
5704440	5709440	For example, VentureV is reporting that Google is only taking a 5% commission on its games,
5709440	5711560	whereas Facebook takes 30.
5711560	5716080	So that might be a little bit more beneficial for some of these developers out there.
5716080	5717080	You know what, though?
5717080	5720240	I honestly think it's going to get harder to be noticed on Google Games because they
5720240	5721640	don't clutter your feet.
5721640	5725640	I honestly think part of the reason why Farmville was so successful was that it did spam the
5725640	5727060	shit out of everybody.
5727060	5731680	And people who didn't know better, i.e. soccer moms, started playing it because they saw,
5731680	5733160	oh, Ethel's playing this game.
5733160	5734800	I should play it too.
5734800	5738520	So I think that's a lot of how those games became so successful.
5738520	5742000	So it's going to be interesting to see if the Google Games model is successful, because
5742000	5747200	honestly, how is going to a different page to see your game content any better than like,
5747200	5752280	I don't know, MSN Zone is a website, Microsoft's site, where you can play games, but I bet
5752280	5754120	a lot of people don't really play there.
5754120	5758400	Going to a different page is that, you know, how different is that going to a different
5758400	5760120	website to play your games?
5760120	5761120	Exactly.
5761120	5762120	I know, I know.
5762120	5765000	But I will say this to Google's credit, it's clean.
5765000	5767720	Like I feel like when I go to Zone, MSN is very cluttered.
5767720	5769400	There's ads everywhere, blah, blah, blah.
5769400	5773400	You know, it's a cluttered website full of clutter.
5773400	5775720	But Google Games, I thought, is pretty slick.
5775720	5779680	Like, you know, one of the things people either love or they hate about Google Plus is that
5779680	5781480	it's very plain.
5781480	5784260	There's not a lot of flair to it right now.
5784260	5786120	It's a very plain looking site.
5786120	5788760	They don't really have ads at all right now.
5788760	5791160	I don't know how long that's going to last.
5791160	5795200	So it's a very clean site, and the games site kind of carries that on.
5795200	5801040	So I did notice that Bejeweled Blitz was kind of skinned for Google Games.
5801040	5803620	I mean, it looks like it was very specific towards that.
5803620	5806320	So I didn't play anything else.
5806320	5807320	That's the only one I played.
5807320	5809440	But I'm down with it.
5809440	5812560	I'm going to check out more Google Games if they get some more stuff I want to play.
5812560	5815200	Like I don't know, Civ World could come out.
5815200	5816360	That'd be great.
5816360	5817920	I'd be into that.
5817920	5818920	We'll see.
5818920	5824520	Anyhow, going to our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
5824520	5828240	Boykman is talking about Dragon Age and all that.
5828240	5832800	It should be illegal to use games like Dragon Age in the same sentence as Angry Birds.
5832800	5837080	Believe it or not, Dragon Age Legends is one of the launch games.
5837080	5838080	I've never played that.
5838080	5841240	Is that like Knights of the Clicky?
5841240	5842240	I don't know.
5842240	5843240	I don't think it's like that.
5843240	5849040	I think it's more of like a simplified version, kind of like a Diablo-esque type of thing.
5849040	5850040	That might actually be kind of fun.
5850040	5852160	I'll have to check that out.
5852160	5853160	Let's see.
5853160	5856520	It says Bejeweled Blitz is good, but it only gives you one minute to play.
5856520	5857520	That's kind of the point.
5857520	5859960	I like the little bite-sized version of Bejeweled there.
5859960	5860960	I kind of like it.
5860960	5866400	So there you go, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
5866400	5867920	Moving on to other stuff.
5867920	5869320	This is another Nintendo story.
5869320	5871560	This is very interesting.
5871560	5875620	Very interesting patent that they filed in this past.
5875620	5878080	Actually they filed it back in 2010.
5878080	5880960	It was discovered within this past week.
5880960	5886080	GameSpot actually found the filing this week, and Nintendo filed the patent for a massively
5886080	5889320	single-player online game.
5889320	5892520	You've heard massively multiplayer online game all the time, I'm sure.
5892520	5897720	But no, they want to do an MSO, a massively single-player online game.
5897720	5898960	GameSpot found the filing.
5898960	5903940	The MSO, I guess, would be an environment where your actions and choices affect the
5903940	5906840	world that they and everyone else live in.
5906840	5913360	So, for example, an economic system, or maybe a case where a player finds building materials
5913360	5917200	and they make a house, then all the other players are going to see the house, just not
5917200	5918200	the owner.
5918200	5921040	And I'm imagining they're not going to see the material either.
5921040	5926560	I guess there's an idea, too, where players would gossip to an AI non-player character
5926560	5929040	who spreads it to other characters in the world.
5929040	5933120	And of course, that instantly made my brain go, oh, it's Animal Crossing.
5933120	5936080	Which I'm sure a lot of people are thinking at this point.
5936080	5939680	Well, and not to say this is the first game that's been kind of single-player, but yet
5939680	5942640	had sort of the multiplayer title like Demon's Souls.
5942640	5943640	Well, it's funny.
5943640	5945600	Bobby was talking about this on his show right before that.
5945600	5949640	He's like, I don't see why Nintendo, I guess I should properly plug his show.
5949640	5953400	He's always before us here at All Games Radio, but he's on at 5 Pacific.
5953400	5956920	Bobby Blackwolf at bobbyblackwolf.com was talking about this subject tonight a little
5956920	5958320	more in depth on his show.
5958320	5961600	And he said, I can think of two right off the top of my head that already do this.
5961600	5963240	And he said Demon's Souls.
5963240	5971120	And the other one was, I fucking forgot, it was a PC game.
5971120	5973480	It's going to come to me as soon as somebody yells it out in chat.
5973480	5975800	I can't remember what the other one was, but there's another game.
5975800	5977960	Random game on the PC.
5977960	5979200	That was exactly like it.
5979200	5983040	I think he was saying, he was trying to say Diablo 3 was kind of part of this too, where
5983040	5987020	Diablo 3 has a single-player mode, but yet it's going to have this auction house that's
5987020	5988480	more massive.
5988480	5992480	So it's interesting that Nintendo would be getting a patent on this when it's kind of
5992480	5995920	already been done, and can they really do that, IDK.
5995920	6002400	Well, especially if the patent was in 2010, Demon's Souls came out in 2010.
6002400	6003400	No, 09.
6003400	6004400	09.
6004400	6008520	Yeah, it was two years ago, I saw that game the first time it was 09.
6008520	6009520	That might be tough.
6009520	6010520	Yeah, it might be tough.
6010520	6015240	Apparently, if players friend one another, they will be able to see and interact with
6015240	6016240	each other.
6016240	6017240	Fable.
6017240	6018240	Well, actually the heck co-op.
6018240	6019240	It was Spore.
6019240	6020240	Spore.
6020240	6021240	Spore was the other game that he mentioned.
6021240	6023680	Because I remember going, oh yeah, I played that for like a week.
6023680	6029120	But yes, Spore was very much, remember you would make your little monster, and then it
6029120	6033320	kind of went off into the Spore universe, and the universe was made up of other creatures
6033320	6036240	that other people had made, but you never played the game with these people.
6036240	6038180	It's just that the players made the environment.
6038180	6042360	And that game was out in 08, I think.
6042360	6048040	To a lesser extent, you could even say that the Wii with people's Miis, because you share
6048040	6051880	the Miis and they pop up in games sometimes.
6051880	6059280	Anyhow, let's see, what else do I want to say about this patent?
6059280	6064080	More, the filing talks about how the game has to be suitable for play on something called
6064080	6066820	the Wii 3D.
6066820	6071040	This was filed, of course, in 2010, so maybe at one point the Wii U was going to be the
6071040	6075380	Wii 3D, or the 3DS was the Wii 3D at one point.
6075380	6077380	Who knows, but don't read too far into that.
6077380	6080360	I'm sure this does not mean Wii 3D confirmed.
6080360	6085360	I'm sure that Nintendo explores a lot of options about what they're going to do, and files
6085360	6089080	patents to cover their butt.
6089080	6092240	It's just interesting that Nintendo would go for something like this when, yeah, I think
6092240	6098040	we have examples of other games that already kind of have done this, so it would be a little
6098040	6101040	bit crappy if Nintendo gets it.
6101040	6105720	I mean, only if Nintendo decides to go after these other developers, but then again, if
6105720	6111560	I were the company that made Demon Souls from software, I would be all like, F you Nintendo,
6111560	6115560	we have this game that was out a long time ago.
6115560	6118600	Just because they do that, though, can they still patent it?
6118600	6122300	Like, if I come up with something but I don't patent it, then they do?
6122300	6126600	The whole patent system in this country is fucked up anyway, and again, I'm going to
6126600	6131840	defer to Bobby's show because he puts it better than I do, but just talking about how it's
6131840	6136960	ridiculous that you can patent all these software concepts, and if you want to see the headache
6136960	6140120	it's causing, just look at all this bullshit with Load Sys.
6140120	6143160	Load Sys is specifically a patent troll company.
6143160	6150320	There is no office, there's nothing to Load Sys besides some troll, literally a troll,
6150320	6155520	sitting under the bridge begging for money, or demanding money in this case, with their
6155520	6159360	stock of patents, and that's kind of screwed up.
6159360	6160520	Something needs to be done.
6160520	6164640	Doing hardware, that's a little different, I get that, but a lot of this software patent,
6164640	6168920	and the other example I know that Bobby always brings up, again, just to totally buy to show,
6168920	6170880	is the one click thing from Amazon.
6170880	6173880	It's ridiculous that Amazon has a patent on one click.
6173880	6177080	The whole one click to buy, one click to purchase, nobody else can do that.
6177080	6178720	Amazon has the patent on it.
6178720	6179720	That's ridiculous.
6179720	6184440	In my opinion, you're patenting something that's kind of like a key functionality of
6184440	6185960	the internet, a link.
6185960	6191920	I'm patenting the Q key.
6191920	6197680	I patent device to create Q by pressing button.
6197680	6201240	Anyhow, it's interesting to see what comes out, of course it's just a patent, it doesn't
6201240	6206180	mean new Animal Crossing confirmed, I mean, those Animal Crossing games do that.
6206180	6208600	New Animal Crossing confirmed, really?
6208600	6209600	They do sell things well, right?
6209600	6211600	Another system, another Animal Crossing.
6211600	6215920	I think you're going to see another Animal Crossing regardless.
6215920	6221020	It could be something, I mean, we are assuming it's Animal Crossing, but to not assume it's
6221020	6226080	Animal Crossing would be to then assume that Nintendo is doing something different.
6226080	6228440	I'm going to take the safer bet and say it's Animal Crossing.
6228440	6230760	I don't know about you guys.
6230760	6232680	Nintendo, different.
6232680	6235920	They just put different in the same packaging.
6235920	6239280	Blakeman in our chat room says, you can be a professional troll.
6239280	6243900	Why was I not informed and where do I get an application?
6243900	6248120	I'm sorry, but trolls more qualified than you have already applied.
6248120	6251200	Those doing the interviews were thoroughly insulted, therefore they were hired.
6251200	6254200	All right, anyhow, let's move on with some more news.
6254200	6257320	Actually, no, the mailbag, mailbag is up now.
6257320	6258380	Let's get to it.
6258380	6262320	Every week here on Orange Lounge Radio, Dark Soccer likes to open up the mail, dive in
6262320	6264480	head first and pull out some emails to read for you.
6264480	6265780	I like to.
6265780	6266780	You have to.
6266780	6270840	Because the music's playing, so therefore you must.
6270840	6275160	Blake at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to email us sometime.
6275160	6276160	Let's get to it.
6276160	6280420	I'm also going to again say that if you send multiple emails, I'm only going to read one
6280420	6281420	of them.
6281420	6283200	So do not take offense.
6283200	6288360	That being said, if you send one email that's like 500 pages, she might trim it down too.
6288360	6292160	Or just not read it or just put it on the form or something.
6292160	6293160	Hi, O.L.R.
6293160	6297000	You've been talking about Capcom a lot lately and it reminded me of something.
6297000	6300880	Back in 08 when I visited Japan, I made it a point to hunt down the Capcom building.
6300880	6304800	Though I couldn't read the website, I used Google to loosely translate the addresses
6304800	6309240	on it until I found a likely one and had a cab take me to the building.
6309240	6310620	The guard there was pretty surprised.
6310620	6313940	My husband and I were looking around for maybe a store or something, but it was just a building
6313940	6316040	with a big old Capcom logo on the side.
6316040	6319280	The guard asked us if we need help and we told him we were tourists and wanted to see
6319280	6322120	the Capcom building and if it had a gift shop or anything.
6322120	6326960	Well, this guard goes inside and brings back the public relations manager for Capcom Japan.
6326960	6330400	We thought it was so cool, she kept apologizing that we'd gone out of our way to see the building
6330400	6332160	and there wasn't a store or anything.
6332160	6334640	We told her it was still great and we love Okami.
6334640	6338320	She gave us folders about investing in Capcom and her business card, so I thought I'd send
6338320	6340280	it along to you here.
6340280	6341520	Just something cool you might like.
6341520	6344280	I'm not sure if she still works there now.
6344280	6346440	Here's a link to the pic on my DeviantArt page.
6346440	6347960	Sorry about the watermark.
6347960	6348960	Sometimes that gets fixed.
6348960	6351320	I swear DeviantArt randomly turns it on sometimes.
6351320	6352320	That's from Holly D.
6352320	6353520	Oh my God, I love it.
6353520	6358080	Here's a pamphlet on investing in Capcom.
6358080	6359080	Hey again.
6359080	6360080	There's the picture of the building.
6360080	6362320	I want to come look at this over here over your shoulder.
6362320	6365640	I guess we can't Tumblr these because these are private pictures.
6365640	6366640	It's on DeviantArt.
6366640	6367640	Alright.
6367640	6370120	Well, I don't know if we want to give away her DeviantArt.
6370120	6373800	We'll leave it to Holly to go post them on the forums if she wants to share, but yeah,
6373800	6374800	okay.
6374800	6377200	Okay, that's kind of what you expect out of a video game building.
6377200	6378200	They're not all that glamorous.
6378200	6380120	It's pretty cool.
6380120	6385040	The Zynga building in San Francisco, which used to be Sega is the, uh, just a brick building.
6385040	6388960	Here is the, uh, oh, it's actually downloading the, no, it's opening it.
6388960	6394020	That's what her car is, Chiho Tamoto.
6394020	6395020	That's cute.
6395020	6396020	What's on the other page?
6396020	6397800	Was there a, is there a second page there?
6397800	6399800	There's another, there's an image.
6399800	6400800	Ooh.
6400800	6402800	That's her signature.
6402800	6403800	Yeah.
6403800	6405800	So kind of cool.
6405800	6406800	Yeah.
6406800	6409400	Let me see if there's anything else though included in this.
6409400	6410400	Nope.
6410400	6412480	Just the, I love that whole, here's some information.
6412480	6416380	If you want to invest in the company, which, you know, again, if you want to really get
6416380	6419240	your point across, you should invest in a company.
6419240	6421400	You should invest in Capcom.
6421400	6423200	I thought that was actually pretty nice.
6423200	6424200	Yeah.
6424200	6425200	That's pretty cool.
6425200	6428880	Um, I think we should go to the Zynga building in San Francisco and say, we're really big
6428880	6430880	Farmville fans.
6430880	6435400	Go outside and overalls, I bought a hoe.
6435400	6437440	We bought her on the corner outside your building.
6437440	6440640	You call me Earl?
6440640	6446120	Dear personages, ooh, after returning from my Vegas trip, during which I had a truly
6446120	6451160	fun time, I gave myself an extra day to run errands and unwind just a little bit more.
6451160	6455440	One of the things I did was I called up my local Walmart, called up the Walmart that
6455440	6461080	is also on the same road, but slightly farther away from me and found myself $170 3DS.
6461080	6465080	I also got a game because the gaming system without a game is just an expensive paperweight,
6465080	6467080	much like my Sega game gear is now.
6467080	6472640	I've got guardian heroes on game gear and you probably don't.
6472640	6476680	Anyway, I'm not emailing you to gloat or be a braggart about my purchase.
6476680	6478680	I'm being a braggart.
6478680	6480920	But I just wanted to ask a question of you.
6480920	6486360	Are any of your three, are any of you three aware of any pornographic websites that can
6486360	6488520	be viewed on the Nintendo 3DS?
6488520	6491760	I mean the thing connects to the internet and what is the internet good for other than
6491760	6495920	whacking off and complaining about, among other things, not being able to whack off.
6495920	6497020	Stay black, writertainment.
6497020	6500160	This message is brought to you by Heaven, otherwise known as the Coca Cola store in
6500160	6501400	Las Vegas.
6501400	6507000	Well, writertainment, you can visit any porn website on your 3DS because your 3DS has an
6507000	6508280	internet browser in it.
6508280	6512880	I think you really want to be asking, are there 3D porno websites out there?
6512880	6514160	Let's look.
6514160	6520320	None that I know of yet, but Dark Sakura, let me Google that for you.
6520320	6523000	Dark Sakura is going to search right now for...
6523000	6526000	Nintendo 3DS boobs.
6526000	6529400	Why don't you just Google 3D porn?
6529400	6532480	3D website porn.
6532480	6534800	3DS porn.
6534800	6539680	There is actually a pack you can get that someone made that's a bunch of 3D pictures
6539680	6541320	that you can upload to your device.
6541320	6543920	They're not pornographic though, they're just like...
6543920	6545920	Like sexy swimsuits and things like that?
6545920	6546920	Like lingerie.
6546920	6552080	It's like some, it's some uh, like uh, idol.
6552080	6556720	Well then I'll leave it to the chat room to try and uh, fill us in on some 3D porno.
6556720	6561040	But hey, you know what though, I mean, there's people out there, they have 3D cameras.
6561040	6564120	I'm sure people have taken 3D pornographic...
6564120	6568680	You know that, look, here's, look, let me just break it down.
6568680	6570960	I'm just gonna break it down.
6570960	6575340	Every 3DS has a 3D camera in it.
6575340	6580840	Pictures of boobs and penises were taken within seconds of the 3DS launch.
6580840	6582680	So those pictures are out there somewhere.
6582680	6587000	It's just a matter of having a place to share those pictures.
6587000	6592160	We should just start a website called my3dsboobs.com and all it would be is pictures of your boobs
6592160	6594720	in 3D for women who'd want to share.
6594720	6597080	Do we know women that might share pictures of their boobies with us?
6597080	6600840	Um, dark, dark soccer, I'm not even going to ask because I know you'd be like, no, they're
6600840	6601840	my boobies.
6601840	6606240	If they will, then send them to me.
6606240	6609000	I will enjoy them with my husband.
6609000	6610000	All right.
6610000	6613040	Next email from Chiggers.
6613040	6617600	Has anyone tried the demo for the indie game No Luca No on Xbox?
6617600	6621760	The whole demo is you swatting Luca the cat away from your cereal.
6621760	6626120	I don't know if the whole game is like that, but I giggled like a school girl, TEEHEE.
6626120	6628080	Give dark Sakura tacos cause she deserves it.
6628080	6629080	P.S.
6629080	6630320	I haven't seen you guys on Drendin in a while.
6630320	6631320	We're art thou.
6631320	6632400	I miss you.
6632400	6635880	I'm only able to check in like once a week cause I'm really busy with raiding now.
6635880	6639760	All of a sudden we are actually doing that, but I will check in on the Drendin Guild very
6639760	6640760	soon.
6640760	6641760	I do at least once a week.
6641760	6642760	I have an idea.
6642760	6643760	What?
6643760	6644760	Tuesday, let's have a Drendinathon.
6644760	6645760	We'll see.
6645760	6650320	I got to check the personal calendar, but maybe, maybe Drendinathon, Drendinathon.
6650320	6654680	Uh, otherwise, uh, as far as the whole Luca, the cat or whatever that game was called.
6654680	6658840	No, I've never played that game, but I'm going to, as soon as I, Oh, I fucking can't.
6658840	6661720	I will in 21 days when the investigation is complete.
6661720	6662720	Thanks Microsoft.
6662720	6666840	I'm actually looking up No Luca No and there's a video on here.
6666840	6669880	This is worst X-Box live game ever on YouTube.
6669880	6670880	Okay.
6670880	6674560	I'm going to have to just send you the link to this Rob so that you can pull it up.
6674560	6676880	By the way, Black Wolf is on it right now.
6676880	6680880	He makes websites, so I'm assuming that Black Wolf is currently in the process of making
6680880	6682620	3DS boobs right now.
6682620	6685360	So we'll, we'll just wait on that.
6685360	6689800	Oh, you're going to send me the link here?
6689800	6690800	I sent you a video.
6690800	6695080	Is there someone talking over it, but I don't want to hear some asshole talking over the
6695080	6697120	thing, just look it up on, on whatever.
6697120	6699400	I'll read the next email.
6699400	6700800	Hi Rob, Jamie and Loki.
6700800	6704120	I just wanted to say, keep up the amazing work and dedication to your fans.
6704120	6710240	And by the way, Jamie, I wanted to inform you about a website, please use the website
6710240	6715840	is abandonedonia.com, A-B-A-N-D-O-N-I-A.com.
6715840	6721480	The website hosts abandonware and such, although I would verify its legality because I honestly
6721480	6723680	didn't pay much attention to it lol.
6723680	6730600	I was looking for a copy of SimTower for my PC and found it on this floating site, so.
6730600	6734700	Also I know it's technically ultra lame to plug a podcast that is unrelated to said current
6734700	6742740	podcast on said podcast lol, but I would appreciate it if you would plug my podcast, Beeeeeeeeeeeeeep.
6742740	6743740	Sorry.
6743740	6745000	Square Tech Podcast.
6745000	6747000	The first episode hasn't been posted yet.
6747000	6748000	Beeeeeeeeeep.
6748000	6753800	But you can view the site associated with my show at Beeeeeeeeeep, where we talk about
6753800	6754800	Beeeeeeeeeep.
6754800	6755800	Beeeeeeeeeep.
6755800	6758840	Thank you, you guys rock my socks.
6758840	6763520	Okay, it's squarepowered.com.
6763520	6765240	You're so kind.
6765240	6766640	Beeeeeeeeeep.
6766640	6769560	Last email, revised.
6769560	6773120	Some tips on reducing the pain and cost of an account hack.
6773120	6775160	Oh, this is from Alan.
6775160	6778120	I'm going to read the whole thing.
6778120	6779120	OLR.
6779120	6783600	So, after what happened to Rob this weekend, I thought it might be nice to try and put
6783600	6788680	together a PSA on account fraud since I had to deal with so much of it at the porn place.
6788680	6789680	Keep in mind...
6789680	6793200	Sorry, I'm watching a video of NoLukaNo, it's adorable.
6793200	6796040	I can't play it because it's got douchebags talking over it.
6796040	6797800	Oh my god, that looks great.
6797800	6802560	All you do, all it is, you just push the stick to shoo the cat away.
6802560	6803560	That's all it is.
6803560	6806320	That's not your cereal, it's my cereal.
6806320	6809240	That's so dopey, I love it.
6809240	6810240	Alright, serious topics.
6810240	6811640	Xbox Live Hacking, yes.
6811640	6816200	Keep in mind that having an account compromised and seeing false charges on a bank account
6816200	6819880	will always be as stressful, infuriating, and scary.
6819880	6823280	There is no painless way to deal with this, but there are things that you can do to protect
6823280	6826360	yourself, so the nightmare is significantly less maddening.
6826360	6827400	1.
6827400	6830720	If you're comfortable confirming that the fraud is isolated to one account because the
6830720	6836280	card used was on file and not actually revealed to anyone, try to have the firm handle it
6836280	6837280	first.
6837280	6840500	Some places refuse to do repeat business with the customer who has filed a charge back against
6840500	6844400	them without contacting them, which might matter if you want to keep a relationship
6844400	6845760	with them.
6845760	6849280	Many will panic and immediately have their bank kill and reissue everything, potentially
6849280	6853040	overkill and an added nightmare of work if it is not truly needed.
6853040	6854040	2.
6854040	6857920	Change your password on any site you can think of that might be billing you via automation,
6857920	6860700	Netflix, your cell phone company, whatever.
6860700	6864320	Many people only slightly tweet passwords from site to site to keep them unique, so
6864320	6866940	doing this is great for your peace of mind.
6866940	6871160	Also consider changing the email accounts for your login to those memberships to something
6871160	6875000	new, and also change the screen name if you can do so seamlessly.
6875000	6876000	3.
6876000	6877660	Sadly, not everyone can do this one.
6877660	6882420	Keep recurring digital services all on the same credit card, and most importantly, a
6882420	6886600	card that has its balance against credit, not a debit card that has its balance against
6886600	6887600	cash.
6887600	6892960	If you decide that a firm sucks ass and you're over it, it's much easier for a bank to
6892960	6897720	issue charge backs against stolen credit versus real electronically transferred cash.
6897720	6901360	Some banks have little to no buyer protection when it comes to online fraud made against
6901360	6902360	money.
6902360	6904160	Also, be prepared to wait.
6904160	6907240	You can always escalate to a manager, but generally telling people you need this money
6907240	6914360	within 24 hours to pay rent, or even if it is true, will not accomplish much other than
6914360	6916300	making the rep feel like crap.
6916300	6920160	That Rob has to wait 21 days after doing all of his due diligence to get a refund is not
6920160	6921320	uncommon.
6921320	6923160	I can vouch for that too.
6923160	6924160	4.
6924160	6925160	Still nervous?
6925160	6928520	Check with the firm that's issuing the refund to make sure it won't mess with the deposit
6928520	6932920	if you got a new card number, and then have your bank issue a new card anyway.
6932920	6936320	All they need to know is that you had something compromised, but it's been taken care of,
6936320	6937780	and that you want a new card.
6937780	6943720	Be wary of eating FedEx costs if it is also your debit slash ATM and you need it overnight.
6943720	6944720	P.S.
6944720	6946400	I want to thank my Jamie's Pinkberry for reading all of this.
6946400	6947600	It was originally much longer.
6947600	6948600	Frowny face.
6948600	6949600	Hey.
6949600	6950600	Toodles.
6950600	6951600	Salacious pop.
6951600	6952600	Don't give away my money.
6952600	6956360	No, those are all some good tips, and I know he kind of used to work in a, um, sales type
6956360	6959960	of environment and probably had to deal right with all that stuff on the front line.
6959960	6965960	Um, so since I worked for a mortgage company too, I can tell you that it is incredibly
6965960	6970640	easy for anyone who has a little bit of your personal information to call in and impersonate
6970640	6971640	you.
6971640	6974920	So I'm going to tell you what I used to do.
6974920	6980720	Every so often, um, involved in mortgage situations when we would have people call in for payoffs
6980720	6986000	on their, on their mortgage, um, you see as their prepayment penalty, something like that,
6986000	6993960	we would have their, um, the new loan officers call in and impersonate the customers because
6993960	6997080	they had all of their personal information right there.
6997080	7001980	And if I at any point ever suspected it, then I would put them on hold, call the customer
7001980	7004480	and say, I think someone's impersonating you.
7004480	7006360	I'm going to three way you.
7006360	7011600	Usually screwed, you know, a person out of a mortgage, but, um, we would have spouses
7011600	7016400	call, we'd have exes call in and because they had, they were privy to all that information.
7016400	7021440	So you, if you also, another thing that will help is it with any of your, um, facilities
7021440	7029040	that you can work with on a phone, if they have a password set up verbally, set it up.
7029040	7033280	I don't want to, I really don't like to talk about my day job on the show cause I try to
7033280	7035560	keep my work life and my nightlife separate.
7035560	7042280	But I will say that, um, for many years I worked in a health insurance call center environment
7042280	7047160	and I will tell you there's many strict laws about what type of information can be given.
7047160	7049160	Cause you know, you're talking about people's health information.
7049160	7053560	There's there's strict federal laws about what can and can't be said, uh, in a conversation.
7053560	7060000	And honestly, part of me is kind of like, I think we need strict laws like that for
7060000	7062480	everything no matter what the industry is.
7062480	7068560	Well, a lot of companies take good care, but clearly my information is at risk in some
7068560	7069560	places.
7069560	7071120	I was such a snot as a customer service rep.
7071120	7076880	Well, keep in mind, I also took escalated calls cause I got promoted to a training rep
7076880	7082640	and uh, I would actually start quoting the federal privacy act.
7082640	7088600	I had, I had it saved as a pdf with parts highlighted and say, well, you can tell me
7088600	7089600	that.
7089600	7091940	I'm like, actually according to the federal privacy act, you know, and would read them
7091940	7094240	line for line like, I want to talk to your manager.
7094240	7097840	Well, my manager can't break the law either.
7097840	7098840	Just hang up.
7098840	7099840	All right.
7099840	7104920	Anyhow, all good tips, all good tips, things I probably should have listened to before
7104920	7105920	this happened.
7105920	7111240	I also want to say that the federal privacy act came out in 1979, so look it up.
7111240	7114600	That's before most of our listeners were born, believe it or not.
7114600	7115600	All right.
7115600	7120600	By the way, Bobby kind of Bobby found us a video of no Luca, no, that doesn't have somebody
7120600	7131760	talking about 1974 no Luca, no.
7131760	7132760	Every time it's no.
7132760	7135160	And I guess you get points every time you shoot him away.
7135160	7136160	No.
7136160	7138280	Now does the game get like harder as you go through?
7138280	7139280	Let me see.
7139280	7140280	Fine.
7140280	7141280	Just eat my breakfast.
7141280	7142280	Fine.
7142280	7143280	Just eat my breakfast.
7143280	7152400	For the record, by the way, the federal privacy act of 1974, no, no one told me.
7152400	7153400	I just looked up.
7153400	7154400	All right.
7154400	7167280	I want to know if this big flashing elephant is it's an elephant with tear.
7167280	7169920	All right.
7169920	7171240	Speaking of making people cry.
7171240	7176900	Once in a while, we like to rant on this program.
7176900	7195140	F.U. to the unemployment office here in California for switching people over to debit cards.
7195140	7198700	And the only reason I'm saying F.U. about this is actually my F.U. is really the Bank
7198700	7204780	of America because California unemployment decided to go through Bank of America to issue
7204780	7205780	debit cards.
7205780	7206780	And that's fine.
7206780	7209980	I have no problem with a debit card.
7209980	7215620	And so far it was actually fairly easy to set it up to do a direct deposit when my money
7215620	7217900	comes in into my checking account.
7217900	7218900	So that's fine.
7218900	7221980	I just have to do my, fill out my stupid form.
7221980	7225540	But I set it up for my first deposit to do that and it's like, no, we're going to set
7225540	7227380	it up for every deposit afterwards.
7227380	7229020	It doesn't work on your first one.
7229020	7232420	So that means I have to go to the bank and have them do a manual transfer.
7232420	7236220	So Bank of America can suck my non-existent card.
7236220	7239340	Loki, do you have any F.U.s of the week?
7239340	7240340	Umm.
7240340	7248340	I don't know if you get a KFC for only having seven out of the ten hot wings I wanted.
7248340	7250100	Did you get shorted?
7250100	7251100	Three hot wings?
7251100	7254340	Well, they said that, well, we only have seven.
7254340	7256260	We'll give you chicken tenders instead.
7256260	7258260	I'm like, eh, fine.
7258260	7259260	Not funny.
7259260	7260260	I don't know.
7260260	7261380	Alright, umm.
7261380	7264020	These are serious, first world problems, Loki.
7264020	7265220	Serious first world problems.
7265220	7271500	Man, they substituted three of my hot wings for chicken tenders.
7271500	7275280	My F.U. of the week goes to the fucker that stole 125 bucks from me.
7275280	7276740	Fuck you, you fucking fuck.
7276740	7279460	I feel a little better.
7279460	7280460	Yeah!
7280460	7281460	Burn his house down.
7281460	7283460	No, don't burn my house down.
7283460	7285300	No, I meant the fucker.
7285300	7290260	It's probably, it's probably, it's got to be some mass operation overseas somewhere
7290260	7291260	that's doing it.
7291260	7294500	I bet anything it's some other country where they've got a shop of people that are hacking
7294500	7300900	all these Xbox Live accounts somehow that probably, the information was probably breached
7300900	7302680	and Microsoft just doesn't know it yet.
7302680	7305980	You know, probably got stolen the same time as Sony's, but whatever, I don't want to make
7305980	7306980	stuff up.
7306980	7310420	But all I know is that I have money stolen and I'm pissed.
7310420	7314860	But at least the lady that worked at Xbox.com was nice and she was nice enough to tell me
7314860	7317060	that hey, she's had money stolen from her too.
7317060	7319220	So gee, that makes me feel better.
7319220	7320580	At least she was honest about it.
7320580	7324220	I know at least she's honest about it and clearly it's not the first time she's gotten
7324220	7328300	a call on it, but I'm a little concerned that they're so blasé about it.
7328300	7331060	You know, like, oh yeah, yeah, it's happened to all of us.
7331060	7335200	Like, oh, just like the fucking red rings of death fucking happened to all of us.
7335200	7339540	Just like the fucking money gets stolen out of our bank account by hackers overseas.
7339540	7340540	Oh, okay.
7340540	7347180	I'll just kind of roll over and let you fuck me while you're, you know, it's, this is ridiculous.
7347180	7350540	Microsoft keeps doing this and yet we all get mad at Sony.
7350540	7351540	Rob.
7351540	7352540	What?
7352540	7355540	It's just irritating heart.
7355540	7356540	I'm not mad at you.
7356540	7360060	I'm just mad at partially mad at myself for letting it happen.
7360060	7361540	I'm just kind of mad at Microsoft.
7361540	7363540	This is ridiculous.
7363540	7364540	Rawr.
7364540	7365540	Rawr.
7365540	7366540	What?
7366540	7367540	Poor Rob.
7367540	7370540	Can we move on to more news?
7370540	7371540	Loki.
7371540	7373540	All right.
7373540	7376700	Um, so this is kind of cool.
7376700	7383180	We're apparently going to be doing some new, I'm assuming it's just a port of Counter-Strike,
7383180	7386860	but Valve is putting out Counter-Strike Global Offensive.
7386860	7392820	It's coming to Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network, and Steam early next year.
7392820	7396500	And of course it's going to have new maps, characters, and weapons.
7396500	7400100	And some renovated classic maps as well.
7400100	7406220	And new modes, matchmaking options, leaderboards, all the usual stuff that they have in shooters
7406220	7407900	nowadays.
7407900	7413140	And um, yeah, I mean that's kind of cool that they're actually putting out a new game.
7413140	7417940	I mean everyone loves Valve games and I'm sure this one will be supported just as well
7417940	7419900	as all the other stuff that they put out.
7419900	7424260	And maybe they'll have hats someday.
7424260	7425260	Yay hats.
7425260	7426260	Hats.
7426260	7427260	Yeah.
7427260	7434260	Um, some other cool stuff, of course, they're going to have a new decoy grenade, which is
7434260	7435260	kind of cool.
7435260	7441300	And some other new animations and models and whatnot.
7441300	7446580	There's going to be a new heavy machine gun, a new range of shotguns, specifically for
7446580	7456580	close-up combat, Molotov cocktail grenades, and I guess some stuff for cutting off certain
7456580	7463940	areas of the map, and then basically a decoy grenade, which it'll do is it'll send out
7463940	7468580	a burst of gunfire from wherever it's thrown, so if you want to make someone think that
7468580	7472540	you're in one place that you're not, then you can do that.
7472540	7480980	And then, I guess they also have some other stuff that they're tweaking, gunfire for different
7480980	7483220	weapons and stuff like that.
7483220	7490140	Also they're going to have, I guess, different things where they're going to give everybody
7490140	7494940	Kevlar the round start or making people have to defuse bombs and stuff like that.
7494940	7499380	So it sounds like if you're trying to tweak up the gameplay and stuff like that, I don't
7499380	7503620	know, it sounds good to me.
7503620	7505420	Are you excited for a new Counter-Strike game?
7505420	7508700	You know I owned the old one on Xbox, even though I am terrible at it.
7508700	7513140	I think I maybe played online once, and I was so terrible I got screamed at and I just
7513140	7514140	cried.
7514140	7520100	You know, I've never really played the original, but I know it's definitely popular, so I mean,
7520100	7523340	I don't know, this should do well.
7523340	7530420	It's one of the first major military first-person shooter games that they had out there, so.
7530420	7531540	I think it'll do well.
7531540	7534340	So can I read a text message I just got from Xtopher?
7534340	7535340	Do it!
7535340	7536340	My co-host over on Hoard House.
7536340	7539820	No, this is hilarious, here you go.
7539820	7545060	Hey, I just thought you should know that, insert person's name redacted here, Xbox account
7545060	7548980	and money got hacked a few weeks ago, just in case you're talking about it on the show
7548980	7549980	tonight.
7549980	7551780	That's person number five I know that's been hacked.
7551780	7553780	I thought that was six.
7553780	7558780	Whatever, it's a fucking lot of people that this is happening to.
7558780	7561860	Nothing's going on at Microsoft, but Sony needs to provide free debics.
7561860	7564420	I'm gonna have Dan check ours now.
7564420	7568540	Seriously, I'm telling you guys, change your fucking passwords, like do it.
7568540	7572140	Alright, anyhow, moving on.
7572140	7576660	Other news, this is about Kingdom Hearts.
7576660	7581460	No it's not news about Kingdom Hearts 3, sorry, but there is of course Kingdom Hearts 3D or
7581460	7584380	Dream Drop Distance, get it?
7584380	7588260	That is coming out I guess soon, you're gonna be getting a hands-on if you're going to the
7588260	7593500	Tokyo Game Show in the fall, however what's also interesting in the Kingdom Hearts universe
7593500	7600420	is in the latest issue of the Japanese magazine Dengeki PlayStation, Tetsuya Nomura actually
7600420	7605100	said that it's becoming difficult to get new players into the series with each new iteration.
7605100	7610900	Well, the plot's kind of complicated, I'm not too surprised at that, but what's also
7610900	7615860	interesting about it, as a celebration of the franchise's 10th anniversary, he hopes
7615860	7620060	to release an HD technical test of the series.
7620060	7621060	What?
7621060	7625940	Does that mean like a tech demo, like Final Fantasy 7?
7625940	7629740	Does it mean remakes of the first game because you're talking about trying to get people
7629740	7630740	into it?
7630740	7632420	That would be awesome.
7632420	7637220	Who knows, but perhaps there's more information at Tokyo Game Show next month.
7637220	7643340	Don't tease me like that, that's terrible that they're teasing us so terribly with that.
7643340	7644340	We'll see what happens.
7644340	7647540	I don't know, Dark Soccer, do you think that Kingdom Hearts is a tough series for people
7647540	7648540	to get into?
7648540	7649540	I don't think so.
7649540	7655180	Yeah, I don't think it's like, I mean, it is a weird plot, but it did always kind of
7655180	7660660	fascinate me, Kingdom Hearts was sort of for kids, but not really, probably older kids
7660660	7661660	definitely.
7661660	7665740	Like a young kid would never understand that plot, I'm sorry.
7665740	7668740	Why is Mickey wearing black and he has a sword?
7668740	7669780	Really convoluted.
7669780	7672780	But I think that's why people really love Kingdom Hearts, is that it is a little bit
7672780	7681980	the darker side of Disney, which, you know, Epic Mickey sort of tried to do, but eh, so.
7681980	7687620	And Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, you made a grammatical error.
7687620	7690340	I'm sorry, what do I do now?
7690340	7691780	Use an apostrophe for it.
7691780	7692780	Oh my gosh.
7692780	7695900	It's a radio show, nobody sees that.
7695900	7696900	I do.
7696900	7701260	Well, how about, well, how about I just use that to go ahead and get into my news then?
7701260	7702260	Sure.
7702260	7703260	Okay.
7703260	7707900	Australia is getting an R18 plus rating, finally.
7707900	7710700	Get with it, Australia.
7710700	7718500	They actually have it added to their new rating system so that they can have mature games.
7718500	7719500	It's about time.
7719500	7723340	I'm just banning them outright, you know?
7723340	7726700	So maybe Mortal Kombat will finally come out in Australia legitimately.
7726700	7727700	Maybe.
7727700	7728700	And some of the other games that have been banned there recently.
7728700	7733700	But I mean, if you look at it from a financial point of view, putting the ratings out there
7733700	7736980	and allowing these games to come out instead of banning them is revenue.
7736980	7738580	That's going to be awesome.
7738580	7743340	There's going to be an explosion of violent and graphic games in Australia really soon.
7743340	7744340	Yeah.
7744340	7747340	And kangaroos will run all over you and punch you in the face.
7747340	7750360	They'll have a bunch of underrated editions come out.
7750360	7752780	You know, it wasn't in the show world, but did you hear about the fuckery?
7752780	7756620	I mean, I'm sure you heard about the fuckery that was going on in Britain this week with
7756620	7758140	all the rioting and all that stuff.
7758140	7759140	So awful.
7759140	7760140	It's terrible.
7760140	7763060	But the real fuckery I'm talking about is how people wanted to blame all that on Grand
7763060	7764060	Theft Auto.
7764060	7766140	Because, of course, you know, you got to blame it on something.
7766140	7768540	You can't just blame it on fuckers being fuckers.
7768540	7769540	Yeah.
7769540	7770540	But it's really sad.
7770540	7773220	When I first saw that on the TV, I was like, I hope they don't burn down Disneyland because
7773220	7774220	I didn't realize it was Britain.
7774220	7779260	I just instantly assumed it was L.A. And then when you hear it, you know, you hear him talking
7779260	7781260	and you're like, what?
7781260	7786780	Well, on top of that, there's trashy people everywhere, but I just, you know, you didn't
7786780	7788940	think it would happen there in jolly old England.
7788940	7793700	Did you did you see the thing I put on my Tumblr about the old man's barbershop?
7793700	7794700	No.
7794700	7799320	There was an elderly gentleman whose shop got ransacked and he had owned it with his
7799320	7804320	wife and his wife passed away and they like completely tore up his barbershop.
7804320	7807100	He'd had it for something like, I want to say, 40 years.
7807100	7808140	How sad.
7808140	7809140	And that he'd have to go out of business.
7809140	7814860	But there's actually an online group going around raising money to to rebuild a store.
7814860	7817260	If I can find it, I'll link it in the chat room.
7817260	7820780	But I thought that was a nice touch.
7820780	7821780	R.D.G.
7821780	7825660	Singe in the chat is thrown back to something last week, but wants to ask Dark Soccer a
7825660	7827580	question and I guess now's a good time.
7827580	7829540	Any updates on the tester?
7829540	7830540	Remember last week?
7830540	7831540	Yeah.
7831540	7832540	I've been upgraded to contestant.
7832540	7833540	Really?
7833540	7834540	Yeah.
7834540	7837100	That means I have to do stupid video.
7837100	7840500	But now I kind of I mean, there's part of me that doesn't want to because I don't want
7840500	7841900	to be away from Dan.
7841900	7847340	Oh, because when he was gone for five days and it made me sad, it's only going to be
7847340	7848340	a few days.
7848340	7851780	And I don't think I don't think it's like Survivor where you can't like call people.
7851780	7854340	I think they I think they'd let you talk to your family and stuff.
7854340	7856020	Well, I'm sure they do.
7856020	7858740	But I mean, I don't like L.A. either.
7858740	7861780	I just I just feel like we're done taping by.
7861780	7863780	I'm going to Disneyland.
7863780	7865980	I just hang out with Marissa all the time.
7865980	7867400	You'd be with other nerds.
7867400	7869620	I mean, of course, they're purposely going to cast people.
7869620	7871460	They're going to drive you bonkers.
7871460	7876020	But you know, if you don't kill them, you might get a job and a couple thousand dollars.
7876020	7877020	Maybe so.
7877020	7880220	But yeah, I got my account upgrade a few days ago.
7880220	7881220	Woo hoo.
7881220	7882220	I guess.
7882220	7883220	So now you're in.
7883220	7885460	You are an official contestant of tester season three.
7885460	7886460	Yes.
7886460	7887460	Bothers me.
7887460	7888460	I don't know why I'm so bothered by this.
7888460	7889460	All right.
7889460	7893540	Anyhow, Loki, we got a couple more news stories for you guys that we're going to open up the
7893540	7894540	Skype line.
7894540	7896340	Folks, I need to put this out here.
7896340	7899220	The eight hundred number is not working tonight.
7899220	7902620	So you can only Skype us tonight at Orange Lounge Radio.
7902620	7904180	The problem is temporary.
7904180	7905660	It'll hopefully be fixed by next week.
7905660	7909520	But just a heads up, you can only Skype us tonight at Orange Lounge Radio.
7909520	7912820	So the eight seven seven number again, not working tonight.
7912820	7913900	Please don't use it.
7913900	7915380	Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.
7915380	7917340	But first, a couple more stories for you guys.
7917340	7925300	Now normally you don't hear of some wild successes on Xbox Live Indie games, but there is one.
7925300	7929820	And this should come no surprise, seeing as it's kind of a clone of another game.
7929820	7937060	Fortress Craft, the kind of Minecraft knockoff, has sold three hundred and fifty thousand
7937060	7942980	copies and brought in over a million dollars.
7942980	7946980	And they said, of course, no, it's not really like Minecraft.
7946980	7949180	It's more of like Dwarf Fortress.
7949180	7951180	But it's Minecraft.
7951180	7952180	OK.
7952180	7954260	I mean, it looks like goddamn Minecraft.
7954260	7960340	So it is the probably the best selling, I would imagine the best selling game on Xbox
7960340	7963060	Live Indie games is making a million dollars.
7963060	7965660	Yeah, that's pretty good.
7965660	7970820	So apparently there is an eighty four percent trial to purchase conversion rate, which pretty
7970820	7974700	impressive, if you ask me.
7974700	7980540	Four hundred thousand eight hundred twenty three copies sold.
7980540	7983660	And they have like a bunch of different statistics.
7983660	7986420	It's funny in there.
7986420	7991260	Ninety six million one hundred ninety seven thousand five hundred twenty Microsoft points
7991260	7993660	spent on the game.
7993660	7998100	Most of the purchases being in the US, followed by Great Britain and Canada.
7998100	8005020	And yeah, so I guess that's a good news for Minecraft when it comes out of here.
8005020	8006540	Looks like people want it.
8006540	8009740	All right, good money.
8009740	8010740	Good thing.
8010740	8011740	All right.
8011740	8016500	Anyhow, the one more story for you guys, then we're going to open up the Skype line at Orange
8016500	8022180	Lounge Radio on Skype, and this has to do with the game Rage that's going to be coming
8022180	8023700	out fairly soon.
8023700	8028060	Of course, this is a new FPS franchise that's coming out.
8028060	8033060	But Tim Wiltis, who is the ID software creative director, of course, ID software is putting
8033060	8034380	out this game.
8034380	8039540	He says that the access to the game's underground will be restricted to those who get their
8039540	8044140	copy new at retail, excuse me, new at retail.
8044140	8046900	He's saying you've played Rage five times.
8046900	8049260	Have you ever found any sewer hatches?
8049260	8052620	If you bought the game new, that would be open for you.
8052620	8055700	So he says you still have to download it, but you don't have to pay for it.
8055700	8057340	Those hatches are all over.
8057340	8060980	Most people never find them, but as soon as you do, you're like, oh, and then you start
8060980	8061980	to look for it.
8061980	8063880	That's our first time buyer incentive.
8063880	8067180	So instead of doing an online pass or whatever a lot of companies are doing, I guess there's
8067180	8072180	these new little zone, for lack of a better word, that you can explore, but only if you
8072180	8075140	are a new game owner.
8075140	8079580	Otherwise, you may never notice it's there, I guess, because it's all in the sewer.
8079580	8083180	And from what I understand, none of the main storyline happens in the sewer.
8083180	8085540	I guess this is all like side quests.
8085540	8091180	So it's basically additional content that's only available when you buy it new.
8091180	8096460	No, no, it's not additional content, because if it's already on the disk and you're just
8096460	8099260	unlocking access to it, then it's not additional.
8099260	8103080	Now if it's some download content, then that's a little different.
8103080	8106140	But I have a feeling this is crap that's already on the disk.
8106140	8112260	They're just allowing you access to it, which is kind of lame.
8112260	8114980	So all right, well, we're going to go ahead and open up the Skype line.
8114980	8117140	We are Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.
8117140	8119380	You can go ahead and give us a call on Skype.
8119380	8125940	In the meantime, we're going to check the Twitter and go to some Twitter topics.
8125940	8130460	I'm going to the Twitter right now, twitter.com, of course, slash O-L-R if you want to send
8130460	8132340	us some tweets.
8132340	8141100	Meanwhile, let's go on to some tweets, starting off with Flaco Jones, who I guess must be
8141100	8146820	listening live tonight, because he's tweeting us and saying, LulzSec announced in mid-June
8146820	8151860	that they released Xbox Live account information, and Microsoft did nothing.
8151860	8155060	No, it wasn't Xbox Live account information.
8155060	8165780	It was some other service that people had emails for and stuff, and they basically said,
8165780	8173220	go try those email password combinations in Xbox Live, Facebook, et cetera, because a
8173220	8176740	lot of people don't change their passwords and they use the same combination all over
8176740	8177740	the place.
8177740	8178740	But I do change my passwords.
8178740	8179740	Exactly.
8179740	8180740	Sums up.
8180740	8181740	No, they didn't hack Xbox Live.
8181740	8182740	Interesting.
8182740	8186740	Yeah, and it does say that the story is appended with an update that says, Microsoft released
8186740	8191180	a statement that Xbox Live was not compromised to the best of Microsoft's knowledge, and
8191180	8195500	the logins passwords were released at random with people encouraged to try the information
8195500	8197740	on services like Xbox Live.
8197740	8199060	And I do remember that happening.
8199060	8203540	I do remember when they released a big list of login and passwords and all that stuff.
8203540	8205220	All right.
8205220	8210100	Also, Flaco Jones in the tweet says to us, maybe if Microsoft took Xbox Live down for
8210100	8214060	a month, when they most likely knew account info had been compromised, no money would
8214060	8215860	have been stolen.
8215860	8217940	Kind of like I guess Sony did.
8217940	8218940	Interesting.
8218940	8224460	Going to another tweet here from Nico Nico Chan tweets us saying, I heard from a friend
8224460	8226980	that Dark Sakura likes Para Para.
8226980	8232100	I was wondering what Para Para dancer she watched on YouTube, if she does.
8232100	8233740	I just watch whatever I find.
8233740	8234900	You just kind of YouTuber.
8234900	8236700	It's more of the songs for you, isn't it?
8236700	8237700	Well, yeah.
8237700	8239060	I mean, there's certain dances that I like.
8239060	8243780	I like the one for Velfar and I like, there's a number of them that I like, but I'll find
8243780	8247760	like different groups and see different people doing them.
8247760	8251420	How can you best, for those that don't know what Para Para is, how can you best describe
8251420	8252420	it to people?
8252420	8254340	Cheerleading in line dancing.
8254340	8256900	Cheerleading in line dancing combined.
8256900	8260140	How would you classify the music?
8260140	8261380	Synthy.
8261380	8265580	Let me let me play you an example of a song from Para Para paradise just in case you've
8265580	8266580	never heard.
8266580	8267580	So imagine doing like...
8267580	8268580	Play Velfar if you haven't.
8268580	8269580	Cheer...
8269580	8270580	I didn't have that one ready.
8270580	8271580	Sorry.
8271580	8272580	This is like cheer dancing.
8272580	8273580	Here you go.
8273580	8280580	Jamie is actually waving her hands in the studio.
8280580	8292820	This is one that I used to know.
8292820	8295780	The only one I knew for a short time was what was it called?
8295780	8298060	Sexy, sexy, sexy, where you shake your butt.
8298060	8299060	That was always my favorite.
8299060	8300500	You need deluxe.
8300500	8301500	I did.
8301500	8302500	That was, that was it.
8302500	8303500	Deluxe.
8303500	8304500	And you knew like a virgin.
8304500	8307140	I taught, I spent a whole night learning the like a virgin dance.
8307140	8308140	And you taught it to me.
8308140	8309540	That's not the Madonna like a virgin.
8309540	8311860	That's a whole different one.
8311860	8315180	And you're going to make me sound like even gayer dark soccer.
8315180	8317740	Oh Rob, that's not possible.
8317740	8319100	Shut up.
8319100	8320100	Heart.
8320100	8323340	I'm trying to find like a virgin because it has the funniest intro ever.
8323340	8324340	Hold on.
8324340	8326640	I got to find it.
8326640	8328540	Do you miss the Para Para machine that was here locally?
8328540	8329540	Yes, I do.
8329540	8331020	I know you said something about that.
8331020	8334060	And someone's supposed to lend me dance master so I can do night of fire.
8334060	8335060	Thank you for that.
8335060	8336480	You know night of fire.
8336480	8339260	I do now thanks to dance masters.
8339260	8340260	So where is it?
8340260	8341260	I can't.
8341260	8342260	Argh.
8342260	8343260	Hold on.
8343260	8345260	I got one of their directory.
8345260	8346260	I got to check.
8346260	8347260	This is an alternative reality game.
8347260	8348260	This is awesome live radio.
8348260	8349260	But hold on.
8349260	8351580	I got to check one more folder here.
8351580	8352580	I used to...
8352580	8353580	Hurry up.
8353580	8354580	We got Pinkberry.
8354580	8361580	I used to have the entirety of DDR Freaks radio's rotation here on the computer and
8361580	8366220	I'm pretty sure they had it in their rotation.
8366220	8367220	Here it is.
8367220	8368220	Okay.
8368220	8369220	Hilarious opening.
8369220	8371580	And the band, of course, is called Virgin Elle.
8371580	8372580	So here you go.
8372580	8376580	It's a little bit sexy, right?
8376580	8377580	Yeah.
8377580	8378580	Maybe not.
8378580	8392700	Zethurin Chat says, when I dance to Eurobeat, I pretend to drive a car really fast down
8392700	8396540	a mountain pass, shifting the gears of my hands and the steering wheel movements.
8396540	8398180	This is not Initial D.
8398180	8399180	I'm sorry.
8399180	8400180	It is Initial D.
8400180	8409980	Initial D. Initial D. But most of these performers, by the way, the bands are out of Italy.
8409980	8410980	Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.
8410980	8414020	Again, the Skype line is open, guys.
8414020	8416620	Going to Tiger Claw since it's a couple tweets here.
8416620	8421940	One of them has to do with Nintendo looking at trademark applications for Wii U in the
8421940	8422940	US.
8422940	8426860	Now, this is not just, I think, what Dark Soccer was talking about earlier, but some
8426860	8432820	other related things, such as point cards, advertising and publicity services for providing
8432820	8433820	information.
8433820	8439300	Let's see, telecommunication via electronic bulletin boards, providing images via communication
8439300	8444940	with handheld game devices, clothing for domestic pets, bags and the like, and so forth.
8444940	8445940	Oh, God.
8445940	8447180	You know what game that is.
8447180	8450300	Clothing, waistbands, belts for clothing, so forth.
8450300	8457420	Card games, notebooks, consumer video game machines fitted with a camera function.
8457420	8458780	Meaning I guess the camera's already built in.
8458780	8460780	Interesting.
8460780	8462420	IDK.
8462420	8464500	All right.
8464500	8466220	Also Tiger Claw tweets us another tweet.
8466220	8469980	Sony wants to know what PlayStation Vita peripherals you want.
8469980	8472960	What do you want to see on the Vita?
8472960	8476540	So I guess some of the responses that are showing up on this poll so far.
8476540	8479220	It's on the Japanese PlayStation Vita community site.
8479220	8487460	A UMD drive, a cradle with HDMI out, a compact full keyboard, a grip adapter with a secondary
8487460	8488780	battery built in.
8488780	8491460	UMD drive is by far the most popular response so far.
8491460	8494380	How about a USB connector?
8494380	8496660	That might be already there.
8496660	8497660	I think.
8497660	8498660	Yeah.
8498660	8499660	That's low keys.
8499660	8500940	Confirm me that it's already there.
8500940	8501940	Again.
8501940	8502940	Orange, Ontario on Skype.
8502940	8506380	If you want to give us a call tonight, I have one of this pay point things where, you know,
8506380	8509660	you put your card up to the sensor and it charges you.
8509660	8511420	Here, I don't have to enter anything.
8511420	8512700	I'll just buy all of this.
8512700	8516220	Dark Tetsuya says, we should totally start B's for Xenoblade.
8516220	8517220	It's a hashtag.
8517220	8518220	Just saying.
8518220	8519220	If you want.
8519220	8521500	Maybe it'll catch on like President Cat.
8521500	8523580	You can do it.
8523580	8524580	I don't know.
8524580	8525580	Go for it.
8525580	8527420	If you think it should be done, you should start that.
8527420	8530180	I will endorse B's for Xenoblade.
8530180	8531180	There you go.
8531180	8532180	All right.
8532180	8533180	We got a call coming in.
8533180	8534460	Let's go to the phones and take the call.
8534460	8535460	Hi.
8535460	8536460	You're on Orange Launch Radio.
8536460	8537460	Who's this?
8537460	8538460	Hello?
8538460	8539460	Hi.
8539460	8540460	You're on Orange Launch Radio.
8540460	8541460	Who's this?
8541460	8542460	Uh, the word Nate again.
8542460	8543460	Hey, what's up, Nate?
8543460	8544460	Yeah, dude.
8544460	8547820	I was calling, um, about, about, uh, the indie thing.
8547820	8548820	The indie gaming.
8548820	8549820	Yes.
8549820	8551980	Um, I'm an indie game developer.
8551980	8554460	You are an indie game developer yourself.
8554460	8555460	Yeah.
8555460	8557460	What games are you developing?
8557460	8559780	Now, don't, don't laugh at me now.
8559780	8561900	I'm making a farming game.
8561900	8562900	You're making a-
8562900	8563900	Right now.
8563900	8564900	Oh, God.
8564900	8565900	You're making a farming game.
8565900	8566900	But hold on.
8566900	8567900	It's not like Farmville.
8567900	8568900	Okay.
8568900	8571940	It's more, it's more like Monopoly mixed with, uh, Harvest Moon.
8571940	8572940	Okay.
8572940	8576940	Now, people like Harvest Moon, so, okay, and Monopoly, Monopoly is a fun game.
8576940	8582880	I read the most weird news story ever this week that was talking about how in Monopoly,
8582880	8585100	you actually don't want to own Boardwalk.
8585100	8587580	You want to own Illinois Avenue.
8587580	8588580	Just throwing it out there.
8588580	8590900	Yeah, I saw an article too, but, um, I didn't read it.
8590900	8593980	I just saw, I just saw it and I said, huh, these people don't know what they're talking
8593980	8594980	about.
8594980	8596600	And I just, I didn't read the article.
8596600	8598100	So the game's not out yet then.
8598100	8601540	You don't have anything to plug just yet, but I guess, and I don't know if you want
8601540	8605780	to give away all the secrets, but how do you combine the worlds of Monopoly and Harvest
8605780	8606780	Moon?
8606780	8612820	Well, and again, you, you really, um, okay, you're trying to start a, a farming monopoly.
8612820	8617580	So you start off as a small farmer and then later down the road, you just, you just, uh,
8617580	8622860	you just get opportunities to take over other people's farms and, um, uh, get new property.
8622860	8625100	You get to get the government to help you out.
8625100	8626100	And it's a lot of crazy.
8626100	8630020	Like we get to take over people's farms with guns.
8630020	8631860	No you get to put them out of business.
8631860	8635580	You're producing government supported crops.
8635580	8637900	You're encouraging people to grow government cheese.
8637900	8641380	Well, it's good, isn't it?
8641380	8647520	Well yeah, but you know, your game's probably going to get like targeted by the organic
8647520	8654660	growers of America or something, and you know, especially the Slow Food International and
8654660	8655660	the Tea Party.
8655660	8658300	No, the Tea Party is all down for that.
8658300	8659820	They don't care about organic food.
8659820	8664340	I'm going to say that crops are organic in the game, even though they aren't.
8664340	8670300	If you have organic ones, then you need to have them cost more.
8670300	8671300	Yeah.
8671300	8677620	And then it'll get bad quicker and it tastes worse, but, um, whatever.
8677620	8678620	All right.
8678620	8679900	Well, let me, let me ask you this.
8679900	8682540	Where did you get the idea to develop a game like this?
8682540	8683540	Like what inspired you?
8683540	8687380	Because, you know, people got to remember, you don't write an indie game in one night.
8687380	8691580	I mean, I guess you can, but that's, you know, most of them definitely are not done in one
8691580	8692580	night.
8692580	8694260	They take a long time to develop.
8694260	8696080	So you really have to be committed to your idea.
8696080	8702540	So where did you get the idea that I want to do a farming game that's not FarmVille,
8702540	8705780	that I will say, I want to do a farming game that's cool.
8705780	8707140	Where did you kind of get that idea?
8707140	8713140	Well, um, it was just random thoughts during the day and I kind of got down to never cause
8713140	8717020	it started off with just three people farming on a farm.
8717020	8721980	And then I thought they should, uh, they should make money and they should, uh, they should
8721980	8725400	have, um, enemies and they should kill wolves and stuff too.
8725400	8729820	So I was thinking about keep a spin on the enemy concept and to, well, they should have
8729820	8732340	a huge mission to be like the best farmers in the world.
8732340	8733340	Oh, cool.
8733340	8735860	So your game does have violence in it.
8735860	8736860	Of course.
8736860	8737860	I'm on board.
8737860	8740580	You get to hit wolves, not people, you don't, you don't steal people farm.
8740580	8746460	You just, you just, you just make them sell out to you by selling your crops for less
8746460	8749500	money than no more purpose, you know, like the Walmart model.
8749500	8750780	So what are you developing for?
8750780	8753620	Are you developing for Facebook or iOS or what?
8753620	8759100	No, it's going to be for the big three, uh, that's not LeBron James, it's going to be
8759100	8762340	for, uh, Mac, Windows and Linux.
8762340	8763340	Ah, okay.
8763340	8767140	So you're going for not, not the big three consoles, but the big three computers.
8767140	8768140	All right.
8768140	8769140	I'm down Mac, PC, Linux.
8769140	8773780	Maybe you will be in the next humble indie bundle.
8773780	8774780	I hope so.
8774780	8780660	But you know, I need to keep developing, especially the graphics because, um, I don't have, I
8780660	8781660	don't have much background.
8781660	8784660	So I just have like skies and trees in the background.
8784660	8785660	All right.
8785660	8787380	So where's a website we can keep tabs on your progress.
8787380	8791220	You have like a blog or something, or at least a Twitter where we can keep tabs on your progress.
8791220	8794980	I want to type it on the chat so you can like see it.
8794980	8795980	All right.
8795980	8796980	It's tailware.com.
8796980	8797980	Okay.
8797980	8798980	Tailware.com.
8798980	8800980	I'll look for that in the chat room.
8800980	8801980	Yeah.
8801980	8807380	So on the site it's other crap on there, but, um, uh,
8807380	8810260	But it'll get better as the game gets further along.
8810260	8815740	It's, it's a huge, it's a really bad demo up already, but that's like a, a really, really
8815740	8817620	old and bad demo up.
8817620	8819140	It's uh, it feels so fresh.
8819140	8820140	I'll give you the link.
8820140	8821140	All right.
8821140	8824540	Well, when you get your game finished and you're ready to get it out there, you got
8824540	8826260	to come back on the show and tell us more about it.
8826260	8829380	I want you to give away all your ideas yet cause you're still developing it, but you
8829380	8832980	got to come back on the show, uh, maybe one of your co-developers and talk a little more
8832980	8833980	about it.
8833980	8838660	Yeah, most definitely, you know, and then we can, um, smurf it up.
8838660	8839660	All right.
8839660	8840660	All right.
8840660	8841660	All right.
8841660	8845900	I'm going to let you go so we get more calls, but thanks for the call.
8845900	8846900	All right.
8846900	8847900	Take care, buddy.
8847900	8848900	Bye.
8848900	8849900	All right.
8849900	8850900	Uh, orange lounge radio on Skype.
8850900	8853860	If you want to call us again tonight, the 800 number does not work.
8853860	8855660	No, we didn't forget to pay the bill.
8855660	8859820	Uh, there's some other issues going on, so we will, uh, be back with that next week,
8859820	8860820	but orange laundry on Skype.
8860820	8868420	If you want to give us a call, um, moving on to more tweets, uh, Osford tweeted us saying,
8868420	8869420	hi guys.
8869420	8871420	Who's in Disney world?
8871420	8872420	You suck.
8872420	8873420	Your mom.
8873420	8874420	You suck.
8874420	8879100	SGA 100 Matt tweets us saying July, 2011 was apparently the worst month for the video game
8879100	8880980	industry in almost five years.
8880980	8881980	Yeah.
8881980	8885900	I read this story too, and it has a lot of people going, oh shit, the video game industry
8885900	8886900	is in trouble.
8886900	8892740	But I'm like, well, what games came out in July, 2011 Catherine, when Catherine is your
8892740	8897260	biggest release, like all month, like, I'm sorry, no disrespect to Catherine, but it's
8897260	8902100	not exactly a triple-a or disrespect to earth defense force, insect Armageddon, or well,
8902100	8906700	sorry, and apparently that's millions of copies either.
8906700	8911600	So I mean, it should though, you just don't have huge, huge titles right now.
8911600	8917140	And the biggest system is the Wii, which has literally fucking nothing on it, but the goddamn
8917140	8918140	puppy bowl.
8918140	8919140	No.
8919140	8926900	Now in July, they had just dance summer party, which was all the DLC for Justin and Smurf
8926900	8933660	stance party, excuse me.
8933660	8938940	Like I said, uh, it's no surprise that I demand an explanation for these shenanigans.
8938940	8943820	Plus the 3DS really doesn't have a lot going for it right now, nor does the PSP.
8943820	8946380	We're kind of in between a lot of consoles right now.
8946380	8950820	I mean, granted the 360 and PS3, you're still kind of at their prime, but they've those
8950820	8955500	systems don't have fucking anything until the holidays, except Catherine.
8955500	8962300	All right, anyhow, moving on to MNZeba tweets us saying, I downloaded juke beat.
8962300	8965380	The Contra song on extreme is hilarious.
8965380	8967340	How are you supposed to beat that?
8967340	8968700	You literally have to memorize it.
8968700	8972720	You're going to have to memorize where all those little fuckers show up and know exactly
8972720	8973720	where to tap.
8973720	8974720	Have you tried a song on expert yet?
8974720	8975780	Loki, just take your Aussie.
8975780	8976860	I haven't even tried.
8976860	8979940	I'm sure it's pretty hilarious.
8979940	8983740	Again, our username on Skype is orange lounge radio.
8983740	8990220	Zither tweets us saying, Loki could learn from reason number one on this five crucial
8990220	8993900	lessons learned by watching kids play video games.
8993900	8996180	And I guess Loki, you could learn from number one.
8996180	8999580	Well, let's, let's recap, but this is a cracked article.
8999580	9000800	All cracked at this website.
9000800	9002560	All they do are like top 10 lists, huh?
9002560	9006020	Like every time I get linked to some top 10 lists, it's all fucking cracked.
9006020	9013580	Like they've made a website out of top lists, not top lists, but top lists.
9013580	9014580	It's kind of interesting.
9014580	9020180	I don't know, uh, five crucial, crucial lessons learned by watching kids play video games.
9020180	9023200	Number five, they don't tolerate losing.
9023200	9026900	So modern games just let them win.
9026900	9027900	They don't tolerate losing.
9027900	9031300	So modern games just handed to them.
9031300	9036380	Number four, they have no tolerance for grinding, you know, like in an old school final fantasy
9036380	9037380	game.
9037380	9043480	Number three, if they want to read, they'll buy a fucking book that might be referencing
9043480	9047040	how I always like to skip to quest text and wow, I don't know.
9047040	9051620	Number two, they press Y to skip as fast as they can.
9051620	9057880	And number one, Loki, you could learn from this, don't like it, break it.
9057880	9063300	And it's talking about cheat codes aren't as much of a thing with this generation of
9063300	9064300	consoles.
9064300	9067660	If they're playing a game, basically they like to just go in and cheat and hack and
9067660	9069980	exploit and break and mod.
9069980	9073740	Well there's a difference between people that want to break games like the people that spawn
9073740	9079920	freeze cars in Grand Theft Auto just like, I'm a hacker, I froze you versus, you know,
9079920	9084700	people like me that just want to play a really fun game with some weapons that necessarily
9084700	9088500	weren't in the stock version of the game.
9088500	9094300	All right, last tweet tonight from Fiedelt61 on Twitter tweets us, final fantasy things.
9094300	9095300	Fucking want.
9095300	9099180	And it's a tweet to a clock here and maybe I'll have to get Dark Soccer to reblog this
9099180	9101900	on the Tumblr so you guys can see this too.
9101900	9106020	It is a clock that is made up of Final Fantasy logos.
9106020	9110540	So like Final Fantasy 12 is at the top and then one, two, three, get it?
9110540	9113140	So it's all the different Final Fantasy logos and a clock.
9113140	9114740	Send me that and I'll put it on our thing.
9114740	9120540	All right, I will send you that link right now so you can reblog that so listeners can
9120540	9121540	see it.
9121540	9125220	Again, that came to us from Fiedelt61 on Twitter.
9125220	9128820	And if you want to send us stuff to cross post, you can send us stuff on Twitter as
9128820	9130540	well.
9130540	9134820	I guess not having the 800 number tonight just killed us on calls.
9134820	9137300	So we're going to go ahead and close up the Skype line.
9137300	9138300	That's too bad.
9138300	9142420	But then again, it has been kind of a slower week and there's not a lot of new games that
9142420	9144660	people are excited to talk about and so forth.
9144660	9148420	So we're going to close on up the Skype line and cover any last minute stories.
9148420	9150900	See if Loki has any last minute stories he wants to talk about real quick.
9150900	9154140	Just one that I think is kind of funny and ironic.
9154140	9161700	Facebook has decided that they're changing their game service to look like Google Plus.
9161700	9167020	They're actually going to be updating things a little bit.
9167020	9173380	I guess they said that game growth has slowed and because of that they're starting to tweak
9173380	9174380	things around.
9174380	9179100	So they're going to have some sort of, looks like a games tab or something like that and
9179100	9184340	different sorting options.
9184340	9188980	Hmm, interesting.
9188980	9192460	I love how they announced a lot of this like the same day that Google Games came out.
9192460	9193460	Yeah.
9193460	9194460	It's pretty.
9194460	9204420	Their re-open of virility I guess is what they're promising and it basically looks like
9204420	9208780	they're ripping off a bunch of ideas that Google Plus had.
9208780	9211060	But of course these have been in development for a long time.
9211060	9212060	Oh yeah.
9212060	9215420	They've been in development for six to twelve months.
9215420	9216420	Of course.
9216420	9217420	Of course.
9217420	9218420	Yeah.
9218420	9219420	Anything else?
9219420	9220420	That's it.
9220420	9221420	All right.
9221420	9225420	Well that brings us to the close of another week here at Orange Lounge Radio.
9225420	9226980	We will be back next week.
9226980	9230740	We will be off in two weeks but we'll be here next week.
9230740	9233460	We've been asked about a marathon show this year on Labor Day weekend.
9233460	9238500	I kind of don't think that's going to happen this year just because there's a lot going
9238500	9240340	on around that time.
9240340	9244460	However, we're going to look at targeting another three-day weekend in the future.
9244460	9246940	So don't be too disappointed.
9246940	9250260	We want to do not just a marathon show but we want to do a marathon that has a little
9250260	9251660	more oomph this year.
9251660	9255560	So what better time to do it than kicking off the tenth year of Orange Lounge Radio.
9255560	9257620	So we'll be looking at that in the future.
9257620	9258620	Right Jamie?
9258620	9259620	We.
9259620	9260620	All right.
9260620	9264220	So anyhow let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
9264220	9265220	Loki we'll start with you.
9265220	9268300	Do you have your final thought tonight?
9268300	9271700	My final thought is I'm hopefully going to be able to play some more games this week.
9271700	9277540	I had plans on doing that this weekend but that kind of fell through.
9277540	9283180	My final thought tonight is I'm looking forward to having some Pinkberry.
9283180	9284180	Yay.
9284180	9285740	Darsaka your final thought tonight.
9285740	9288740	I'm going to read exactly what's on macro memory now.
9288740	9291740	50 Cent got shot and still whines about it on stage.
9291740	9297340	Teddy Roosevelt got shot mid-speech and didn't leave the stage until he was finished.
9297340	9298340	Interesting.
9298340	9302180	50 Cent got shot on stage?
9302180	9303180	I had no idea.
9303180	9304820	No he got shot and he just whines about it.
9304820	9305820	Well I mean getting.
9305820	9306820	I would.
9306820	9307820	If somebody shot me I'd whine.
9307820	9308820	Not on stage.
9308820	9309820	Oh.
9309820	9312140	But Teddy Roosevelt got shot and finished his damn speech.
9312140	9314660	Still if I got shot I'd be whining about it.
9314660	9315660	All right.
9315660	9317740	But that's for another week.
9317740	9319780	Actually no I should never be shot actually on the show.
9319780	9320780	That would be bad.
9320780	9321780	All right that's it.
9321780	9322780	We're out.
9322780	9323780	Have a wonderful night everybody.
9323780	9324780	We'll be back here next week to do it all again.
9324780	9328940	Hope to see you here live Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at All
9328940	9330060	Games Radio.
9330060	9331580	Until then we'll see you next time.
9331580	9332620	Thanks for listening.
9332620	9334740	Tell a friend about the show if you enjoyed.
9334740	9335820	Spread the word Orange Lounge Radio.
9335820	9340020	We don't have advertising dollars and so therefore we don't stick the show full of ads while
9340020	9341020	we ask word of mouth.
9341020	9342020	Have a good night.
