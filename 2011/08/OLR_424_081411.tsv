13891	25056	Tonight, August 14th, 2011, a patent possibly spills new details on the Wii U controller, games finally arrive on Google+, and Australia gets a new rating for graphic games.
31567	36169	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
36369	38010	Orange Lounge Radio.
38070	42092	We are live on this lovely Sunday evening, August the 14th of 2011.
43233	49036	My name is Rob Roberts and with me as always, say hello to the one, the only, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
49156	49436	Hi.
49676	50496	How are you, Jamie Summers?
50937	51297	Burpee.
51637	52077	Burpee?
52297	52958	A little gassy?
53658	54679	I've been drinking root beer.
54759	55499	Having a root beer.
56159	56499	Awesome.
57080	58240	By the way, it's episode 424 tonight.
60248	62110	424.
60268	62110	It's a palindrome episode.
62610	63031	Quite.
63611	64833	Like dad and mom.
66054	66715	Exactly.
70159	70599	Other words.
71480	73402	Not a palindrome, but maybe a prime number.
73442	73923	I'm not sure.
74003	75264	Say hello to Techmaster Loki.
75304	77226	Don't worry, we'll end the same way as we began.
77326	77687	Terrible.
80402	84687	Yes, inevitably when the show ends someday, it will end the same way it began.
84707	85869	We're just talking about tonight.
86169	93018	In fact, Loki will have to do the last episode in one of those cheap little $5 microphones.
93658	95421	What was that microphone we had on the first episode?
95441	95941	It was terrible.
95981	97203	You sounded like you were coming through a phone.
97600	101722	I believe it was a piece of foam wire attached to a paper cup.
101862	102743	Yeah, something like that.
102763	105264	It was two Dixie cups and a string, actually, I think is what he was using.
105684	111687	All right, anyhow, usually we start off the show with how was your gaming week, but I got to start this off tonight because this is some big drama.
111707	112287	Oh, here's a word.
112968	113128	What?
113748	114568	I don't want to hear about words.
114588	115829	I want to tell you about my drams.
116229	116889	Ibophobia.
117569	118010	What's that?
118110	118950	Fear of palindromes?
120150	120911	Um, no.
121971	123291	A dog, a plan, a connection.
123311	124432	You are so random.
124532	124792	All right.
125152	126552	Oh, is the word itself a palindrome?
126572	126993	Yeah, it is.
127213	127653	Oh, okay.
127673	130554	I was like, what the hell are you just spouting off random words for?
130754	132334	Are we playing Balderdash tonight?
132594	133675	Was I not aware?
133695	134635	And so is Deleveled.
136414	137595	Deleveled is a palindrome.
137835	138115	All right.
139256	140396	And as our chat room.
140697	141617	God, I love the chatters.
141897	143939	Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
144359	144919	Always present.
144959	146120	Fourth guest on our show.
146680	147481	Chat with us live.
148241	151223	And Alpha Cananogram starts us off tonight reminding us of another palindrome.
151263	153044	He says, also, boob.
154005	154205	Yes.
154345	157667	Apparently, ibophobia is an irrational fear of palindromes.
158843	181822	Alright, look, I gotta tell about my dramas Okay, dramas And I just mentioned this to you guys before the show started But you haven't really heard all the details yet So, okay, here's what's going on So you know how everybody's all up in arms Like, oh my gosh, PlayStation 3 Our information all got stolen Sony's in deep shit And needs to give us all Years of credit protection And all this stuff, right?
181862	185925	Yet we haven't really heard of any cases of people actually getting their information stolen On the PlayStation 3, right?
186025	186206	Right
186806	192731	Okay, well I didn't have information on the PlayStation 3 stolen, but I had $125 charged on my Xbox Live account last night.
193172	193412	Bleh.
194409	198092	So while everything... And by the way, I'm not the first person to have that happen.
198672	202695	It's happened to one of my friends who hasn't even really played Xbox in like a year.
203055	210119	It's happened to another guy I know on Twitter who I know well from seeing it like E3 and he's a listener of the show and so forth.
210400	213322	And I want to say I've solved one other case on Facebook as well.
213662	216624	So it's not an isolated thing.
217024	219826	Folks are having their Xbox Live accounts hacked.
220126	220947	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
242364	243785	So I wanted to sign on and play it today.
243845	247748	I played it last night for a little bit and I wanted to play it today before the show so I could give you more thoughts on it.
248228	258935	When I tried to sign into my account on Xbox Live, it told me that the profile information was corrupt and needed to be resynced or it needed to be redownloaded from Xbox Live.
258975	264899	Basically the same pop-up you get if you ever have played on somebody else's Xbox.
265339	269202	You know, you have to download your data to be able to play on that other person's Xbox.
269622	280071	So that told me my information had been downloaded to another Xbox, except for the fact that I had just played Shadow Planet last night, and I hadn't played on any other Xboxes since then, I think I would know.
280411	284935	The only Xbox I really used to do that with was Alan's when I used to drive when he lived in the Bay Area.
285295	288357	I would go down there, transfer my info for the weekend, then come home, transfer it back.
288377	289678	I hadn't done that in months, you know.
290479	300572	So that told me something was wrong, and instantly the first thing that came to my mind was, wait a minute, I saw Justin tweet about this like two days ago, his information got hacked, I'm gonna go check my bank account right now.
300892	305638	I don't know what made me think to look, sure enough, I look at my bank account, there's two charges on it, one for $79.99, one for $49.99, both from Xbox Live.
308301	313882	and I go into my Xbox Live account and somebody had bought a gold pack, premium pack.
314002	318243	I don't even know what game it was for because by the time I saw that I was already on the phone with Xbox.com.
318623	320084	The good news was I was able to get right through.
320124	322124	I didn't have to wait on hold for a half hour or anything.
322504	331186	Talked to a lady there who was fairly helpful but one thing that struck me as kind of odd that she told me was that, oh yeah, I got hit for $350 too.
331726	335787	Oh, so a fifth person who works for Microsoft also got hit.
337321	339008	and we're all mad at Sony, why?
343638	349723	Now I understand why we're mad at Sony, but something tells me we need to be a little irritated with Microsoft right now.
349923	358410	Either somehow information got compromised or there's something out there siphoning our information and they are currently getting all of our passwords.
358710	366696	So my advice to you, you need to stop what you're doing right now and go change your password on Xbox.com because if you haven't, you're at risk for this.
366876	370199	So don't come crying to me when they take $125 from you because it's going to suck.
372069	373230	It's going to suck for them because I don't have $125.
375733	380077	And there's a lot of folks that are saying, I'm going to a chatroom, chat.orangeandre.com.
380537	383460	Sickman says, I prefer buying things with cash and this is why.
383800	386463	TigerClaw says, Sky, this is why I use the Xbox Live cards.
386503	387604	I never put a credit card.
388384	388605	Okay.
389105	392748	That's nice to do in retrospect, but let's face it, I didn't do that.
393208	404055	Microsoft doesn't exactly make it easy either to do things that way, especially once they have your credit card from an Xbox Live account that I had set up for gold many years ago.
404255	408838	I've only had one card on the Xbox account, and it's been expired now for four years.
408938	411360	And if you want to take it off, I think you have to call to get it removed.
411440	413621	It's ridiculous.
413641	415243	It's a pain in the ass.
415263	417304	They wouldn't be able to use it anyway because it's expired.
418124	418925	And I've never renewed it.
419225	430877	Something's coming for Microsoft because I'm telling you this is happening more and more and it's not going to stop with just me and the people I've spoke about unless miraculously we've convinced the entire internet to change their passwords.
431958	436943	It's going to keep happening and I kind of think Microsoft needs to speak up a little bit about what's going on.
436983	442388	If nothing else, they should be putting out some bulletins about security alerts because this is just more work for them.
443149	450393	I want to tell you this, by the way, as well, which is really important, is that the whole process for them to investigate is going to take 21 days.
450793	453435	So I'm not going to see that money back for 21 days.
454035	457057	Now, luckily, I'm gainfully employed.
457417	458618	I have a savings account.
459038	461499	I can cover the loss of that money for 21 days.
461939	462740	It doesn't affect me.
462820	464901	But I know we have a lot of college kids that listen to the show.
464921	467643	They're like, I don't even have $125 for them to steal.
468263	471785	So I'm just warning you, do something about it.
472125	493495	I have thought about calling the bank but I thought at the end of the day ironically enough my card expires next month so I was kind of thinking like you know why go through all that hassle when I'm going to be getting a new card anyway and it's just kind of like if you start flagging all the Microsoft transactions as suspect then that's probably going to give me more headache in the future
493675	494436	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
508954	512196	It's going to go through anyway, and you're going to have to deal with overdraft charges on top of it.
512496	512676	Right.
512796	519860	So, you know, the good thing is most banks have a protection thing, and, you know, it's at least there's a way to have it investigated.
519900	521561	But it's just the whole thing is frustrating.
521601	527745	And just, you know, once again, knowing that someone has stolen my information is kind of crappy.
527825	528885	It's a crappy feeling.
528905	530506	I have no other way to explain it.
530806	534809	And the reason why I say once again, I had my Warcraft account hacked about...
535689	536150	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
557950	560952	So, yeah, it kind of ruined WoW for me for a little while.
560972	562853	When I came back to WoW, I rolled a new character.
563374	567496	I haven't touched that character since that whole incident three some odd years ago.
568017	573000	So, learn from my mistake, I guess, although I don't think I made a mistake.
573060	584727	I mean, with Warcraft, I'm pretty internet savvy and I don't log into a lot of suspicious stuff, but my ex was not internet savvy and I did play WoW on his computer, so I think I know how I got compromised there.
585067	587369	But this, I'm having a really hard time figuring it out.
593417	595886	How many other systems have you at all played on?
597458	599018	Just Alan's.
599779	604119	Maybe one of Loki's systems years ago, but that would be it.
604239	605720	Honestly, it would just be Alan's.
606040	608420	It seems to me that it's a breach from within Microsoft.
608540	613682	Or an old Xbox of mine that I would have given to Loki, but we wiped... No, because I had the old hard drive.
613742	615462	It wouldn't have the information because I have the old hard drive.
616002	618242	I don't have any hard drive zeros anyways.
618322	622143	All the systems I have, like I said, I don't have the hard drives.
622223	625244	And then it seems to me that it's something from internal...
626989	630552	And once again, it wouldn't matter anyways, even if your profile's on there, unless I knew your password, it wouldn't matter.
632293	647327	And I mean, in that case, all you would really need to know is the email address that you used for your account and the password, basically the live.com login details, and then you recover your profile that way.
647827	648067	So...
649705	651787	It's a bummer, but yeah, that happened.
651847	654109	So just kind of a heads up warning to folks.
654509	658953	So, you know, now I'm out that money, but luckily I have money in savings.
658993	660614	I'm just going to transfer over to cover it.
660654	662436	It's not too big of a deal for me.
662576	668121	Thankfully, I have a savings, but I just don't want to see it happen to many more people because it's a shitty feeling.
668161	670122	And I kind of want to know how it happened.
670182	670923	You know, you want to know.
671303	673285	Like, somebody's trying to steal money from me?
673385	673745	Who is it?
673785	674626	I want to kick their ass.
675166	676387	That's what I want to know right now, so...
677108	678670	I guess we'll see what happens.
678790	680031	But it's not just me, you guys.
680672	682314	You guys are probably seeing it on your Facebooks too.
682354	693626	Yeah, if you do a search on Google for hacked Xbox Live account and search for the past week, there's plenty of links for people saying, hey, my account's been hacked.
695293	695553	Wow.
696834	698215	Bobby just sent me a private message.
698235	700797	I'm not going to say who it was, but he knows somebody else that got hit for $100.
701837	704079	So, good gosh.
704279	707441	It's not isolating, you guys.
707461	708502	That's why I'm bringing it up.
708542	712984	We've all been panicking about Sony, Sony, Sony, Sony, but nothing ended up happening with that data.
713024	714205	Not to say nothing ever will.
714465	715586	Don't sit on your laurels.
715906	718708	Make sure everything's been changed and your passwords are up to date there, too.
718728	722811	But I'm just saying, if you thought Microsoft was better, you're wrong.
724096	725177	Listen up, fanboys.
725637	728899	I got $125 stolen from my Xbox account today.
729199	731781	Microsoft is no better than Sony, I'm here to tell you.
734283	741408	So, that's what I wanted to just kick off tonight's show with, a lovely little warning that no company is immune from all of this data theft going on.
741448	744149	If there's money somewhere to steal, somebody is going to try to steal it.
745250	746251	Doesn't matter what company it is.
747805	776660	on that note let's talk about your gaming week and the types of video games you've been playing this week I won't be able to play my by the way I can't sign into my account for 21 days they've suspended my account during the investigation which will take three weeks they say I can play offline stuff and what have you but most of the stuff I play is Xbox Live Arcade and I don't want my achievements to get screwed up so I basically won't be playing Xbox for the next three weeks so if you see me on in the next three weeks you might want to drop me an email because it's not me I won't be playing for the next three weeks PlayStation 3 here I come woo
778024	779145	Alright, DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
779165	788492	You should come over here and play Super Metroid Funny enough, I've been playing a Metroid very much like game this week, but I'll get to that in a minute DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
790345	794086	Wow, and stupid freaking Tiny Tower.
795006	796726	Fucking bitizens.
797527	798507	Ungrateful wretches.
800847	803808	And just a few things on Steam here and there.
804728	805728	You know, nothing major.
806529	807589	Just sort of, meh.
809429	809969	That's about it.
811089	812970	But Rebecca Black is level 70.
815049	815870	Congratulations.
815990	817151	Fun, fun, fun, fun.
817431	818512	Yeah, gang fight.
818852	820673	Now who plays nothing but WoW?
820693	823475	It's very interesting how things have changed in a year.
823675	823896	Hey.
824376	827999	I got a look at some of these comments that are coming in from chat room about the hacking going on.
828339	835564	Xenacor in our chat room says, Remember, if Microsoft locks down your account, your games for Windows stuff will also be locked down, so check your Xbox Live now.
835904	840528	You can't play Dawn of War 2 offline because it requires a login.
840548	840728	Okay.
841468	843469	Thankfully, I don't use Games for Windows.
843509	844130	I use Steam.
844190	845270	Nor does anyone else.
845911	847452	I have used Game Room.
847852	849553	That's about the extent of it on Games for Windows.
849673	850193	Oh no!
850713	852474	Your Game Room games.
852494	855036	You won't be able to download any more Game Room games.
855396	855956	Oh no.
856797	858858	All those releases that you're missing out on.
859318	860058	No, but I get it.
860098	864559	Xenocore saying Dawn of War 2 is tied into that, and I'm sure there's other games.
864900	866060	And we have a story on it tonight.
866400	872902	All these companies want to tie you into their online service, so if you're a fan of one of these games, you kind of get screwed.
872982	874202	So there you go.
875142	875522	Let's see.
875623	877023	Going to other comments in chat.
877743	880384	Blackwolf clarifies he got hit while he was playing.
881645	885648	I only must have missed it by a couple hours because I was on last night and then I noticed it this morning.
886729	887130	Let's see.
888171	892815	Sickman in our chatroom says, the only mistake you made, Sky, was buying Microsoft products.
893275	895257	It's the same mistake a lot of us have made.
895898	896038	But I
896278	897738	No, I'm sorry, that's stupid.
897758	899199	I wanted to play Shadow Planet.
899319	902279	That's actually probably the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.
902359	907321	It's a little bit fanboyish, but, you know, obviously there's some haters out there on Microsoft.
907421	907961	Oh, come on.
908241	911982	Like, PlayStation people can hate on Microsoft about network security.
912302	913622	Come on, you can't say shit.
913742	914242	Exactly.
914282	917583	Like, Sony fanboys can't point and laugh at what's going on here.
917623	918163	You can't, but I'll...
920844	925546	My point to telling this story was Microsoft fans can't point and laugh at Sony.
925767	926587	You are not allowed.
927727	928428	I'm here to tell you.
928708	934090	Because money was actually stolen in this case, you are not allowed to point and laugh at what's going on with Sony.
934311	943275	And you're not allowed to tell people that they can't, you know, this is what you get for supporting Sony or whatever bullshit I read on Twitter during that whole stuff going on.
943875	946177	Ziba in chat says, I don't have any info on my Xbox account.
946217	947138	I have a silver account.
948719	954544	Like I said, my card is up in September, and I'm definitely having thoughts to keeping a card online now.
954964	956365	I think I might have learned my lesson.
956886	957326	IDK.
958347	964912	Well, if your card auto-renews, just be aware there's a whole lawsuit we'll get into probably later on about...
966073	966634	It won't matter.
966754	970598	They'll still try to charge it, and then when you put a new card on there, they'll charge it twice.
971078	971919	Oh, jeez.
972259	975263	My card expires before Xbox Live does, so it won't matter.
976204	978326	Anyhow, Loki, how was your gaming week?
979484	980585	I'm pretty good actually.
980625	981565	I played lots of stuff.
982205	983566	I played Tiny Tower.
983586	990228	Of course, I played it what I call the abridged version, which is I cheated the hell out of it and I finished the game completely.
990888	994189	I literally have built as much of the Tiny Tower as I possibly can.
994249	995730	I have all the shops.
996270	1001072	All of the different everything, all maxed out, all the achievements.
1001412	1004873	I have as many citizens as you can possibly fit in the building.
1005193	1007154	All I can do now is build a bunch of empty floors.
1007174	1008134	Because you're a cheater.
1008815	1010015	I don't care because you know what?
1010035	1010815	That game is annoying.
1010975	1012416	That game made my brain melt.
1012756	1014957	Seriously, that's the feeling I got from playing it.
1014977	1017578	I'm like, oh, I'm so glad to be done with this game.
1017978	1018699	Thank you for watching!
1041461	1044886	I would think that they should be smart enough to know, hey, we're out of stuff.
1045166	1047369	Maybe we should, I don't know, restock it.
1047509	1049651	But then where's the game, Loki?
1050653	1051594	What would the game be?
1051974	1055458	You see, your problem with Tiny Tower is that it's not Tiny Tower Sniper.
1055538	1056560	That's your problem with it.
1056840	1057260	DarkSakura.com
1073325	1074406	was a game dev story.
1074486	1075326	That's pretty fun.
1075546	1077487	Bobby says that Tiny Tower has a bug right now.
1077687	1081108	Yeah, if you have it open, you're only earning half the cash.
1081128	1083049	The newest version botched something.
1083329	1084149	Yeah.
1084830	1086190	I'm earning a lot of cash.
1086210	1089051	Well, actually, I can't get any cash.
1089171	1092612	You robbed the tiny bank and you took all their money.
1094933	1100675	It's more like he printed his own money with his tiny printing press.
1104890	1110798	By the way, I've gotten some FUs on Google and Twitter for mentioning Tiny Tower on this program.
1111359	1112841	FU for getting me into Tiny Tower.
1113923	1116066	I've seen that multiple times this week.
1118602	1127228	I tried playing Jukebeat on my iPod and it seems like a simple idea.
1127268	1131331	You just tap the squares as they light up.
1131771	1134353	For some reason, the difficulty is way too high.
1135073	1137555	I'm assuming it's because I have an iPod and it's really small.
1138335	1146440	You can tweak it so that the touch area is really big, so you can actually touch in the middle between two squares and it'll tap both of them.
1146861	1152404	But even still, after doing that, I still keep failing a level 2 song.
1152804	1156707	And I'm sorry, if it's that hard, then it's a little ridiculous.
1157187	1159789	Why would I want to buy more songs for it?
1160589	1162050	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1188988	1193409	Yes, I'm saying the game that the In The Groove people made is better than the game that Konami made.
1193509	1194629	I can't believe I'm saying that.
1194690	1195050	It's true.
1195190	1195650	I agree.
1195830	1197050	It is true.
1197750	1202872	And the reason why it's true is because I shouldn't be failing a level 2 song.
1202932	1205752	I mean, this is like if you're going to DDR, okay?
1205792	1207193	Well, Loki, you just suck at jukebeat.
1207313	1207593	Oh, no.
1208093	1208853	Oh, I must.
1208933	1210774	I'm reading the comments from the internet right now.
1211034	1213014	You just... I'm imagining these guys.
1213334	1214415	Loki, you just suck at jukebeat.
1214815	1215075	You just...
1216135	1216976	You need to try more.
1247616	1254658	The only thing about Jukebeat that's irritating is that when that little thing comes up, you have less than a second to hit it.
1255098	1256499	You have no time to react.
1257099	1258420	And you're playing that first song.
1259640	1260821	Literally, it's lighting up.
1260841	1268644	There's a little passage in the Frogger song that goes... So you have to be able to hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it.
1268664	1269004	You've got to...
1269744	1271626	It's like playing whack-a-mole at hyperspeed.
1271886	1276572	And there's no real indication of what's going to be next other than it just moving really fast.
1277252	1277813	And I don't know.
1277973	1282658	If maybe U-Beat is a little bit better in the arcades, I'm not really sure.
1282738	1286943	But if this is exactly what it is in the arcades, I'm not too excited about it.
1287484	1288405	But hey, you know what?
1288425	1290127	Kind of cool that they put something else out.
1292938	1294359	But it's just kind of eh.
1294759	1301162	SSJ100Mac confirms in chat, Juby, which is its name over in Japan, on the iPad is a lot better.
1301563	1306645	And I could see where on the iPad my fat finger isn't getting in the way so I can actually see all the things.
1306685	1309347	I can lay it on a table and probably play it easier.
1309967	1310768	Thanks for watching!
1327998	1330520	All Universal is means it has both versions in one.
1330761	1332562	You can still have different versions of the game.
1332782	1334284	I think Tiny Tower is Universal too.
1335004	1337927	Okay, but still, then why is it played so terrible?
1338488	1341290	I mean, I didn't have this problem with ReRave.
1342191	1344473	ReRave, it was easy enough for me to hit everything.
1344773	1348375	I think re-rave just makes sense, and this game doesn't.
1348496	1349076	I'm sorry.
1349196	1352478	It's just kind of where I'm at with it.
1352558	1354700	I think re-rave was just more interesting.
1355180	1356501	The targets are a lot bigger.
1356801	1358502	They come up with more advanced notice.
1358882	1363746	They're actually on the beat, and you can tell, like, oh, a red one means it's on the downbeat.
1364126	1366127	A blue one means it's on the upbeat.
1366187	1367748	Like, it just makes more sense.
1367788	1369209	Like stuff that they used to do.
1369269	1370590	Oh, fuck, there's notes everywhere.
1371571	1373212	Like stuff that they used to do in DDR.
1375453	1403864	it's like Konami you forget that you released music games in the past and what you did to make you know make those see that's what I don't understand this is a company that understands accessibility with their DDR games a little too much accessibility if you ask me but yet for some reason a casual gaming platform as you would normally view it they made this game so fucking difficult that most people would be just like whatever and they're just gonna get they'll delete it because it's free
1405345	1406246	I love that Contra song.
1406266	1407488	That Contra song is awesome.
1407568	1408850	But the rest of the songs are terrible.
1423126	1424027	I don't like Frogger.
1424067	1425047	Frogger needs to die.
1425367	1427308	They need to stop putting out new Frogger games.
1427448	1429269	The 3DS Frogger, eh.
1430450	1434151	I don't understand the point for the 3DS Frogger, but whatever.
1434271	1437153	At least they're doing something slightly different with it.
1439414	1441975	Frogger, not really a game I know for its music.
1442395	1444516	In fact, I don't believe there was any music in Frogger.
1445609	1447491	All right, I got to read some comments from chat here.
1447511	1449132	We're backing up on comments here.
1449673	1456139	Going back to the hacking stuff, Sickman wanted to clarify an earlier comment and says, Sky, you completely misunderstood me.
1456259	1457821	I meant they make shitty hardware.
1458441	1459782	I'm not going to disagree with you there.
1460183	1465708	The hardware Xbox makes, I mean, considering the whole Red Rings of Death and all the other crap they've had to deal with.
1466008	1469892	Yeah, Microsoft does kind of make shitty hardware, but my problem wasn't a hardware issue.
1471173	1471433	at all.
1473315	1474675	Yeah.
1474755	1477077	Other things I played this week.
1477517	1491246	VVVVVV because I got the Humble Indie Bundle and yeah, it's very difficult and I'm kind of frustrated I'm at this one level in the game where you have to escort this guy across the screen and it's annoying.
1491686	1496269	It's just annoying the controls because it's very floaty, I guess.
1496990	1497090	Um.
1498920	1506899	so but hey you get unlimited lives it's just sometimes it's annoying but I think I'm almost finished with the game I have like I think two more people to rescue and that's it
1507679	1510180	Yeah, but there might be a whole little twist coming up or something.
1510200	1510680	Yeah, I don't care.
1510700	1512640	Remember how Castlevania had the upside-down castle?
1512800	1513261	Yeah.
1513621	1514021	Be ready.
1515141	1518862	And then other than that, let's see.
1519502	1521503	I played more Earth Defense Force.
1521583	1523523	I downloaded the two weapons packs for that.
1523543	1527645	I still haven't gotten a chance to actually try the weapons, but I've downloaded them.
1528185	1532206	And then also more Grand Theft Auto, of course.
1533066	1537309	and I do have in Singingly Twisted Child Planet but still haven't played it yet.
1539851	1543533	I'm really wanting to play it because the reviews have been great.
1545114	1545755	Hopefully soon.
1548430	1577300	I think that's all I've played alright I'll talk about my gaming week besides what I mentioned at the top of the show well I have mentioned I played insanely twisted Shadow Planet which I was enjoying it's basically Metroid with kind of like Limbo's graphics in a way I don't know how else to explain it I really like it I downloaded the demo and the minute I realized I'm like oh this is like fucking Metroid except it's a spaceship that you control so it's more of a you don't just move left and right and jump you fly anywhere you want
1577720	1578421	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1594597	1599079	But it doesn't exactly hand you the what to do on a silver platter.
1599459	1601940	It's very abstract in some ways.
1602060	1604041	But it doesn't really take away from the experience.
1604481	1605442	I was really enjoying the game.
1605462	1607663	And I'm kind of pissed I'm not going to be able to play it for three more weeks.
1608003	1610204	Because I was on a roll and I kind of wanted to beat it.
1610844	1612345	But I only got about maybe a third of the way.
1612365	1614646	I think it said I was like 30% complete or 33% complete.
1615006	1616667	Eh, won't be able to do that now for three weeks.
1616987	1618148	So thanks, hackers.
1618508	1621029	Did you recover your profile to your system?
1621229	1621429	No.
1622329	1623230	You were unable to do that.
1623670	1630638	No, well, they said I could play offline, but I just, I don't know, I'm at a point where I just don't want to because I don't want my achievements to get screwed up and all that.
1630659	1631580	Yeah, it will get screwed up.
1631600	1637086	I was going to say, if you recovered your profile to your system, you could play it and it wouldn't matter because it would sync back up when you're done.
1637447	1640290	But if you haven't, then yes, all those achievements would go bye-bye.
1640470	1641531	Yeah, no, I didn't do that.
1641591	1643193	So now I'm kind of stuck.
1643633	1644474	So it's all right.
1644694	1649038	I've got some stuff on PlayStation 3 I want to play, but just irritating.
1649458	1651140	And then there's always WoW, right, Jamie?
1651440	1652401	We've got a lot of ratings to do.
1652461	1652821	Yes, there is.
1652841	1653522	You can play some L.A.
1653562	1654323	Noire.
1654463	1654903	That's right.
1654923	1655804	I have not touched L.A.
1655844	1657606	Noire yet, and I have your copy on PS3, so...
1658486	1660328	I'm totally missing it right now.
1660629	1661410	I do need to play it.
1662130	1665835	The silver lining in my crap story is there are PS3 games I need to play.
1665855	1668457	I actually got back my games that I've been loaning out to people.
1668497	1670339	Some of them I completely forgot that I've been loaning out.
1670379	1673463	I got my 3D Dot Game Heroes back in Portal 2.
1674524	1677027	I like Portal 2 on every goddamn system now.
1678989	1680630	I need to go back and finish co-op in Portal 2.
1680670	1681731	That's another thing I need to do.
1681791	1682511	So I've got plenty to do.
1683212	1685814	And randomly, okay, so insane Twisted Shadow Planet.
1686114	1690918	If you like Metroid, you need to be downloading the demo right now after you change your Xbox Live password.
1690958	1698103	Go check it out because, or the Castlevania, Metroidvania, any of those types of games, you will like this game.
1698624	1700485	It's got really pretty sharp graphics.
1700565	1701926	It's like playing a cartoon.
1702407	1703007	It's really cool.
1703487	1704628	You've got to check it out.
1704648	1705969	Jamie, I think you would really like this.
1706009	1707991	You really need to make it a point to check it out this week.
1708994	1710820	Dan, change your password!
1711422	1712184	At least get the demo
1714721	1741546	by the way I forgot so go ahead I randomly had a I want to play Civilization 5 and when you want to play Civilization 5 that turns into a 5 minute thought that goes on for like 4 hours because you can't just like stop playing Civilization 5 so I played an entire campaign over the weekend you were still playing when I went to bed I was playing as the Spanish and I played from start to finish
1741886	1746989	Granted, I was playing on dopey easy level because I'm really not good at civilization, but I beat it.
1747389	1751252	I did a cultural victory and I got the no one expects the Spanish Inquisition achievement.
1751672	1753413	So now I'm playing another.
1754613	1755274	What better way?
1755294	1758196	I kicked it up a difficulty level and now I'm playing as...
1758996	1759617	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1775612	1776573	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1791809	1793049	It's my all-time favorite PC game.
1794030	1796290	So it's no secret that I adore Civ 5.
1796330	1797691	I think it's one of the best in the series.
1798191	1799391	It's certainly better than 2 or 3.
1800031	1800932	4 was pretty good too, though.
1801652	1802292	But I love 5.
1803452	1804393	So I was playing that.
1804953	1810094	And on the PlayStation 3, Extover had a random gaming night last night.
1810234	1812655	So a couple of us went over there and played...
1813135	1815196	Hardcore Uprising Super Smash Bros.
1815216	1815316	Melee
1833746	1834486	Brawls on the Wii?
1834666	1836467	I can never remember which one's which.
1837267	1843490	We played the Wii one for a little while, and then we played one other game that I'm totally forgetting right now.
1843570	1845671	Oh, we played Katamari Forever on the PlayStation 3.
1845931	1846671	I know, random, right?
1846751	1850553	But, you know, I brought a stack of games over, and that's what we chose to play, so...
1851353	1864322	that was my game night that's pretty much my gaming week lots I've been pretty busy and then of course wow wow wow lots of wow stuff but oh yeah I have the other show for that someone's gonna teach me how to tank for a fee I'm just kidding
1865058	1866039	I'll pay you in Pinkberry.
1868180	1868480	All right.
1869301	1873324	Blackwolf in our chatroom says, I love playing Dopey on Dopey Easy level in Civ 5.
1873384	1874024	It's so much fun.
1874044	1874885	That's the way to play.
1875865	1881029	That's the best way to play Civ 5, especially if you're not very good at the strategical types of games.
1881929	1882229	All right.
1882610	1885252	That's going to do it for how was our gaming week.
1885332	1886733	Hope you guys had a good gaming week too.
1887374	1888495	Quickly, some housekeeping.
1890136	1892058	We're still having shows over the next few weeks.
1892078	1894139	You guys are going to do a show when I'm not here, right?
1894500	1895521	You said you're going to do it anyway?
1895701	1896061	No.
1896441	1896622	No?
1897142	1897562	You're not doing it?
1897582	1898023	I thought you were.
1898303	1899284	No, I'm babysitting.
1899304	1900285	On a Sunday?
1900345	1900625	Sunday?
1903157	1903437	Yes.
1903797	1904057	Okay.
1906238	1907839	No, not a human baby.
1908399	1909219	Oh, the kitty babies.
1909379	1910060	The kitty babies.
1910080	1911720	That's on the 29th and 31st, I think.
1911760	1913121	I'm still watching the kitty babies.
1913241	1914601	So no show the 28th then?
1915121	1915422	Yeah.
1915622	1915902	All right.
1916302	1917622	Yes, a show or yes, no show?
1917642	1917822	No.
1917863	1918103	All right.
1918303	1918983	No show.
1919443	1920804	No show on the 28th.
1921584	1922944	So you can plan accordingly.
1924365	1924645	All right.
1925165	1927926	Visit us on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
1928186	1930087	And of course, Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.
1930107	1931528	We'll be taking some of your tweets at the end of the show.
1931548	1931788	And a Tumblr.
1933430	1934612	Yes, and our Tumblr now, too.
1934772	1937476	Orangelaunchradio.tumblr.com All right.
1937796	1939819	Loki just beat one of the hard parts of BBB.
1939939	1940761	Yeah.
1940841	1942724	I fucking hate that stupid mission.
1942944	1943625	I hated that, too.
1943645	1944005	It was terrible.
1944045	1944907	Let's put this on pause for now.
1945107	1945327	All right.
1945788	1948592	Yeah, you got to put it on pause because you got to start us off with some news tonight.
1948632	1949894	What's going on in the gaming world tonight?
1950514	1950995	Lots of stuff.
1951315	1963426	So let's start talking about the Steam trading beta that they're going to have, which is kind of cool in case if you're buying some packs and you get a bunch of extra games or stuff gifted to you that you may already have and whatnot.
1965007	1971853	Basically, what this is going to allow you to do is trade different items for, I guess...
1972834	1981256	Didn't really say yet, but like, for example, you can trade, I don't know why you would do this, trade like games for hacks in Team Fortress 2.
1983137	1984437	Yeah, I don't know about that.
1986078	1991339	Yeah, right now the service only supports trading of items, I guess, in Team Fortress 2.
1992200	1996161	But they're going to be supporting other things soon, I guess, Portal 2.
1996761	2000262	So I think maybe they're talking a little bit more of just actually like in-game items right now.
2001402	2004865	But eventually you'll be able to trade for games and whatnot.
2006226	2008627	I guess they're going to be allowing you to trade for games.
2011129	2012550	So that's kind of cool.
2012990	2020515	And actually, if you think about it, I mean, that's pretty cool that they're heading in that direction anyways.
2020535	2024398	Because if you think about it, you can swap games with people.
2025078	2025959	I mean, essentially.
2025979	2026059	Yeah.
2026579	2027720	I think it's a neat idea.
2027800	2033824	I mean, it's still in its early, early stages, obviously, so of course it's kind of restricted to Valve products.
2033864	2044071	I mean, I guess it's not just Valve products you can trade, but I guess the stuff that you can trade for right now is really only Valve, at least with the microtransaction type of stuff.
2044412	2050516	So it's still very vague to me, like how this all works, because I don't really have any extra copies of games to trade right now.
2050816	2052938	I wish I'd known this when I bought Terraria.
2053438	2054739	I wouldn't have given a copy to Jamie.
2054759	2055660	I would have traded it away.
2055720	2055960	Hey!
2057666	2059949	I like Minecraft Aria.
2060770	2061170	Kind of.
2062812	2066177	I had four copies of that game and I literally gave a copy to somebody.
2066237	2068019	I was like, I think he'll like it.
2068139	2068600	I don't know.
2070002	2071223	And I don't even know if he's played it.
2071484	2072986	So I could have traded that for a hat.
2074430	2074911	DarkSakura.com
2093007	2098331	I kind of go, eh, I don't really need a hat in Team Fortress 2 because I don't really play that game.
2098351	2105435	But then I go, huh, if 2K bought into this, I could buy the Korean Civilization expansion for Civ 5 and that I would enjoy.
2105455	2113040	Yeah, that's amazing how this buy-sell-trade stuff works and how people like it and how it promotes the sales of new items.
2113561	2114461	That's amazing.
2115082	2117103	Gee, I wish publishers would have thought of that.
2121489	2131773	I don't think we're going to get into the topic again, of course, of how they're trying to discourage buy-sell trade stuff with more of the online codes and whatnot.
2132233	2136294	They don't understand that they're just... I think we have a game that's doing something.
2136334	2138475	It's something different than an online pass.
2138495	2139856	We'll get to that.
2141076	2144157	But they don't understand that they're only hurting themselves.
2144277	2147399	I mean, by discouraging buy-sell... First off...
2150841	2159509	The argument that the developers don't get money for these games if people are buying used copies is a bunch of bullshit.
2160010	2168198	Because, for one, the developers get money when the game is sold from the publisher, not bought in the store.
2168558	2170039	Perfect example, Catherine.
2170740	2171882	Thank you for watching!
2186804	2192630	So, say for example, your average gamer, they can't afford new games.
2193791	2202320	And so they're buying used games, they're selling their used games, trading them into a GameStop or wherever to get credit towards a new game.
2203101	2203621	Thanks for watching!
2229019	2229600	Thanks for watching!
2246034	2246594	Thanks for watching!
2264039	2274667	I don't think, not everybody but I think there's going to be some people that are like oh I could buy the multi-pack for just a few dollars more and I guess I could maybe trade somebody that for a DLC and get like a deal there.
2275047	2281212	It's opening up this whole new flea market style thing for games it's really interesting to me.
2282152	2282393	Yeah.
2282633	2283214	Looking forward to that.
2284175	2285918	Are you purchasing something on Steam right now?
2286118	2286378	Yes.
2286999	2287780	I'm being nosy.
2287800	2288201	What are you buying?
2288221	2289743	Oddworld Abe's Odyssey is $1.24.
2290885	2291986	Oh.
2292006	2292607	A whole dollar?
2293288	2293568	Yeah.
2294149	2294870	I like Oddworld.
2295051	2295772	Oh, Oddworld's cool.
2299269	2299609	All right.
2300589	2303950	So looking at our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
2305070	2309511	Infanel in our chat room says, buy games during the special deals at 75% off.
2309551	2311352	Trade later when the price goes back to normal.
2311512	2311992	Possibly.
2313012	2313432	Let's see.
2315533	2318713	Breakman in chat says, what kind of in-game items does Portal 2 have?
2318793	2324595	Nothing yet, but that's... Well, yeah, there are hats, but aren't they supposed to be getting some other stuff soon?
2324995	2325175	So...
2325835	2329098	Yeah, where the hell is that download content that we were promised back in June?
2329859	2330320	IDK.
2333122	2336586	Is that going to come out before or after Half-Life 2 Episode 3?
2338287	2338607	After?
2338908	2339308	Damn.
2339688	2340709	That's assuming it's coming out.
2340729	2343172	Do you see people protesting outside of Valve for Half-Life 3?
2344993	2346275	I know one of the guys that was doing it.
2346335	2348437	It was apparently an old guildie of mine from Valve.
2348457	2349017	Okay, I'm sorry.
2350018	2350639	Let me put it this way.
2350919	2352160	I think they were just having fun.
2352360	2353101	Okay, well, good.
2353141	2354963	I'm glad they're having fun because you know what?
2355063	2357705	Gabe isn't starving for sales.
2358045	2360127	He's definitely not starving at all.
2360307	2367834	I mean, so there's no reason to think that they're in a hurry to make Half-Life 2 Episode 3.
2369996	2374820	I got the sense that it was just something fun to do.
2374900	2375921	They'll do whatever.
2375961	2377803	I mean, they'll work on it.
2379574	2380095	Thanks for watching!
2395896	2401561	Alright, moving on, talking about other games and so forth, PC games specifically, Battlefield 3.
2402822	2411170	And you know what's interesting is one of the ways a lot of people got hooked on Steam was that if you wanted to play certain Valve games, you kind of had to install Steam, and then everybody saw the deals that came with that.
2411691	2418857	And then of course a bunch of other publishers got on board, and we just talked earlier, there was a chatroom comment about some games that require game for Windows to power them.
2419237	2419478	Well...
2419998	2424120	EA is soon going to be requiring Origin for Battlefield 3.
2424960	2430102	That's right, if you want to play the PC version of Battlefield 3, you will have to register for EA's Origin service.
2430823	2434904	This came from the DICE community manager, Daniel Matros.
2435385	2436705	This was all confirmed via Twitter.
2436745	2440667	I guess somebody had put it out there if this was going to be a requirement, and it was confirmed.
2441227	2456666	So retail, digital, doesn't matter where you buy it, you will have to sign up for Origin, which if I'm not mistaken, EA's whole online thing kind of all shifted to Origin anyway, so it doesn't totally surprise me, but I don't know, it's just like, I really don't want...
2457347	2458728	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2479463	2482084	No, it's because you want to try to sell exclusively on Origin.
2482104	2483344	That's really the deal.
2483364	2485565	But you want to make Valve out to be the bad guy.
2485785	2490586	Hold on, because their complaint is that Valve wants to control the patching.
2490926	2492067	And EA doesn't want that.
2492207	2493527	EA wants to control the patching.
2493947	2497188	To really make a long story short is ultimately what it boils down to.
2497488	2501149	They don't want to have to push all their patches through Valve and get approval from Valve.
2501469	2502650	They want to be able to do it themselves.
2503570	2504250	That's what it blows down.
2504270	2508812	Yeah, but see, that doesn't make any sense until we know how hard the approval process is for patching.
2509093	2510613	If they're like, here's the patch, okay.
2510893	2514055	I mean, it's just an excuse is what it is.
2516296	2520441	Going to our chatroom in the comments, Kaijudo says, I won't be playing Battlefield 3 on PC.
2520881	2524024	Zether says, fuck Battlefield 3, I'll play Battlefield 2 instead.
2524865	2532593	Going back a little bit further, talking about Half-Life and all that, Tigerclaw says, the Source engine throughout the years has been getting massive upgrades with every new game.
2533034	2537058	Take Portal 2 for example, it runs on the Source engine and the graphics are better than before.
2537678	2538119	That's true.
2539179	2542662	Tigerclaw also points out to the folks saying, fuck Battlefield 3 on PC.
2543462	2547546	A game like that was strictly made for PC in mind, then portaled to the consoles.
2548887	2555031	But see, you know, this whole requirement for Origin and stuff, that's just right now.
2555071	2561136	I mean, look at, like, Portal 2 and stuff, or even on the other, like, Valve products.
2561376	2564598	You don't have to be connected to Steam nor to play those on your PC.
2565319	2565699	No, you don't.
2566750	2572094	So, I mean, hackers will fix the problem, okay?
2572334	2574756	They'll come and save the day and that'll be the end of that.
2575176	2576817	I kind of like Steam.
2576917	2582181	Their actions have shown that they're really trying to be on the pulse of what gamers really want.
2582461	2585623	Not what executives want for gamers, but what gamers really want.
2586043	2588145	I mean, the sales have been really kick-ass.
2588845	2594029	This whole trading thing, although it's a little weird, I like that they're even fucking going there.
2594469	2600031	I mean, I do not expect Origin or Games for Windows to be following this, what Valve's trying to do here.
2600391	2603192	And that's kind of part of the reason I'm a little loyal to Steam.
2603693	2610235	They've shown, they've really tried to push what they're trying to do for privacy and security and to make sure all that stuff's locked down.
2610615	2614597	Their DRM is restrictive enough without being too restrictive.
2614617	2620579	I mean, I don't want to come off sounding like a fanboy, but I feel like Steam's proven themselves where others have not.
2622935	2624436	and that's basically what it boils down to, right?
2624516	2624816	Yeah.
2624836	2625496	It's my money.
2625797	2626257	Yeah.
2626357	2627117	Prove to me you want it.
2627217	2627738	Yeah.
2629078	2633101	You're starting to sound like what's her name in Portal 2, the secretary.
2633121	2634041	Burn his house down.
2636663	2640345	All right, anyhow, let's move on, DarkSakura.
2640745	2642286	Away from the PCs for a little bit, right?
2642406	2644407	How about some Wii stuff?
2645456	2645736	Wee!
2645836	2646017	Wee!
2664794	2669215	and it has the microphone, speaker, and camera functions that are also included.
2669695	2677518	There's actually a neat little diagram of someone holding a Wiimote over it and using it as a, like playing golf with it.
2677638	2685640	So using it to sense where the Wiimote is in terms of the floor, I guess.
2687040	2697587	But they're also saying that it does have different IR modules and likely it's going to also include connectivity with the 3DS.
2698527	2703711	And it also says it's going to be about as strong as the PS3 and the Xbox 360.
2705336	2705757	Magnetometer
2723647	2724768	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2743743	2744164	Yes, it does.
2744184	2745485	Don't want to do the Japanese releases.
2745525	2748209	There's usually some type of navigation software for the PSP.
2748369	2750131	Yeah, they have an attachment for it.
2750331	2751993	It's an extra accessory.
2752194	2754817	I meant this is going to be for the Vita, but it's already in the move.
2755831	2763774	I think it's all just going to be integrated into their whole immersive environment type of thing I really want to know what Nintendo's online thing is going to be I almost think it's going to be something like a handheld Kinect
2785083	2788505	It'll have this similar functionality, except it's going to use it in conjunction with the Wiimote.
2789846	2790326	Something like that.
2790346	2793508	I think their online's going to be tur-arable.
2793888	2795689	Did you say turd-arable?
2795729	2797971	I thought you were going to say terraria, and I was like, really?
2797991	2799952	You're going to Minecraft your way on Nintendo Switch?
2800152	2802534	I was making it seem like I was going to say terrific.
2802854	2806276	And then, mid-word, I changed it to terrible.
2806296	2806516	I like that.
2806656	2807277	Turdrific.
2807297	2810419	Therefore, being funny, adding humor to the word.
2810479	2811400	I like turdrific.
2812080	2813581	I'm going to use turdrific from now on.
2813641	2816623	Well, Loki, yet another failure of your humor on this program.
2816683	2822127	Hey, I considered excess myself, so... Failure, I do not see that.
2822928	2826411	Just like the 3DS, it is a very successful product.
2827171	2828532	It's not failing at all.
2828752	2829373	Horse turds.
2830854	2831634	I like turdrific.
2831674	2833376	I'll use that in a sentence three times today.
2834497	2834877	Okay.
2838221	2838801	Let's move on.
2838821	2840542	More gaming news, Loki.
2840602	2841162	Guess what?
2841402	2843282	PS3's got another firmware.
2843563	2846023	Hurrah!
2846543	2846023	3.7.
2846603	2851744	It brings fun stuff as auto cloud saves and trophy syncing as well.
2852705	2857846	However, in order to actually access any of these features, you have to be a PlayStation Plus member.
2858684	2859285	That's too bad.
2861487	2866571	Yeah, some of the stuff that they were hinting at before when they were talking a little bit about PlayStation Plus.
2866891	2870395	Also, they've done some rearranging of their TV and video services.
2871456	2873838	I guess I'll be added to the cross-media bar now.
2874598	2879580	and a new category will house online services like Hulu and Netflix.
2880241	2882822	So kind of tweaking some arrangement around.
2882862	2884783	Moving your stuff all around.
2884883	2889305	And of course the undocumented features are they're signing stuff with new codes now.
2890405	2891566	Or new keys, I guess.
2892116	2894357	Trying to prevent all the hacking and cracking behind the scenes.
2894697	2895037	Of course.
2896458	2897158	I said trying.
2897918	2900439	Yes, that is the key word, of course.
2901079	2901520	Trying.
2901560	2903920	I'm sure somebody found a way around it in 24 hours.
2903940	2905581	Yeah, they already have.
2908982	2909282	All right.
2909803	2913584	Well, I downloaded the firmware and I didn't really notice anything.
2915085	2915725	Hooray, I guess.
2917344	2920327	I guess I always expect maybe my games will suddenly be more fun.
2921308	2922789	Patches don't ever really seem to have that.
2923928	2925989	Hey, Gamefly, you've probably heard of them.
2926049	2931151	They're a pretty popular Netflix-y type of service for games.
2931251	2939034	But this time, they're kind of going further in that direction of Netflix, where soon you'll be able to play the games on demand.
2939494	2941095	It's a PC thing, though.
2941115	2943236	It's unlimited PC play service.
2943616	2948258	You know, they took over direct-to-drive some time ago, and this seems to be the next step of that.
2949058	2966623	Gamefly says that they are talking to all publishers about participating several have been signed but we're not announcing at this time in the unlimited PC play portion for Gamefly subscribers we expect to have over 100 titles available for the beta launch but we'll be adding to the list constantly and should have hundreds at the time of our holiday launch so
2967823	2994617	I guess also some folks are asking well then if they're going to have the PC thing only will there be a plan for Gamefly that is only PC kind of like how there's a Netflix streaming only plan Sean Spector the co-founder of Gamefly said in response to that we currently have no plans to offer a digital only subscription as we believe the real value to gamers and our members is our unique combination of console and digital PC game offerings so in other words no the plans aren't going to be any cheaper so
2995237	2996818	I guess that's kind of cool.
2997238	2998179	I mean, I don't know.
2998259	3001120	It kind of sounds like what GameTap used to be.
3001420	3002261	Remember GameTap?
3002801	3004542	They're still around, but they suck now.
3004862	3006863	When they first came out, it was an interesting concept.
3006943	3011205	But yeah, then they got sold and not so great anymore.
3011525	3014486	So I guess it's kind of neat that somebody's trying to pick that up.
3015367	3017487	I noticed this little demo screenshot.
3017507	3022389	I don't know if this was just mocked up by somebody, but it has games like DC Universe and so forth in there.
3022829	3025410	It's because they bought Direct Drive.
3026131	3027811	Oh, and that was some of the games that were on there?
3027931	3028192	Yeah.
3028512	3028952	Interesting.
3029552	3034674	Well, it'd be kind of cool if some of the games are playable infinitely, but I don't know.
3034694	3041177	I don't have my hopes up that it'll be much more than a lot of the Flash games or really old games.
3041217	3044258	That's kind of what GameTap had, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.
3044358	3046158	I mean, just because a game is old doesn't mean it's bad.
3047059	3052561	One thing I really liked about GameTap was that it had all the old-ass King's Quest games and all the old Zort games and all of that.
3052981	3053381	DarkSakura
3064830	3068532	Well, how about some news for the UK Nintendo 3DS price cut?
3069412	3086199	This is basically just the overall game revealed recently that they have a trade-in deal where if you trade in a DSi XL, you can get a 3DS for £49.99 or with Zelda Ocarina of Time for £59.99.
3087860	3089921	So that's actually a pretty decent deal.
3091241	3097609	Also, the regular price of that is $159.99 bundled with a Zelda Ocarina of Time.
3097869	3099772	Again, this is in British pounds.
3100693	3103737	If you trade in a DSi, you will get it for $89.99.
3106178	3114205	So looking at the vendors overall, this is what you're looking for for the different prices.
3114305	3116547	Not all of them are going to price match, but here's what we have.
3117067	3119249	For Tesco, it's 115 pounds.
3119289	3119990	For Morrison's, 120.
3120030	3120110	Asda, 134.
3120150	3121791	Sainsbury's, 140 pounds.
3129137	3132140	Online, for Amazon it's $115, Shop 2 is $135, GameStop $135, GamePlay $135, and Play $140.
3132180	3137965	And then High Street and online it says Toys R Us is $135, Curry's is $140, Argos is $150, Game is $150, while online it's $140, and HMV is $150 and includes a free game.
3137985	3138925	It's $140 online.
3154057	3177625	Just to kind of piggyback on that a little bit, if you want to know what's going on here in the U.S., Target honestly started a system, which I thought was weird, because I didn't really think of Target as buying your old systems, but apparently Target, I guess it was just this past weekend, so you might have already missed it, so sorry about that, but I guess Target was accepting DS trade-ins as credit towards a 3DS, an XL was worth $100, a DSi was worth $75, so I guess...
3182566	3185048	My target doesn't sell used games or any that I've seen.
3185088	3187250	Are there other targets out there that are in the used game market now?
3187370	3189933	I haven't seen it unless they have a deal with another used game vendor.
3190153	3190673	That could be.
3190934	3196419	Maybe they sell them back to a vendor that sells those.
3196459	3196819	I don't know.
3196999	3197339	Interesting.
3199962	3202904	Keep your eye out on places like Target and so forth here in the U.S.
3202924	3205346	because there will probably be other details like that soon.
3206127	3214857	So, anyhow, speaking of things to do at the game store, there's some release dates we gotta go over around the world, and we'll start off with the US release dates, Loki.
3216122	3220546	Not a lot this week, of course, because this month's... That's been the theme of the past month.
3220566	3221267	Yeah, pretty much.
3221367	3222187	It's been slow.
3222508	3224569	But at least there are some actual things coming out.
3225070	3229934	Starting off with No More Heroes Heroes Paradise on the PlayStation 3.
3229994	3236759	That's actually getting a budget price to it, which is kind of cool, because it was full price at one point.
3238641	3240282	With move support as well, so you...
3241423	3242003	Age of Empires Online on PC
3266079	3278565	Puzzler World 2 for Nintendo DS Emily the Strange Strangerous on the Nintendo DS and yeah maybe this is the problem with the Wii right here
3279713	3283376	Jerry Rice and Nidus, Dog Football for the Nintendo Wii.
3283657	3284958	Fuck, that sounds awesome.
3285058	3286059	I love the Puppy Bowl.
3286319	3288040	That's like the best part of the Super Bowl.
3288080	3288941	Dog Football.
3288961	3290142	The only good part of the Super Bowl.
3290162	3292124	That's the only thing worth watching is the Puppy Bowl.
3292224	3294706	I could give two shits about the regular football game.
3294726	3295587	The Kitty Cat Halftime?
3295647	3297869	Yes, Kitty Cat Halftime is what it's all about.
3298530	3299731	Dog Football on the Wii.
3300591	3302913	That's an amazing release on the Wii.
3302973	3305676	Why you gotta be rough on the releases?
3309451	3310752	Don't forget to tip your waitress, everybody.
3334009	3335390	No, wait, I did see one.
3336030	3338191	I saw one, so I guess it is slowly coming out.
3338791	3339711	So, there you go.
3340312	3343733	All right, anyhow, moving on to the Japanese releases and what's coming out over there.
3344513	3353177	On the Xbox 360, Dirt 3 comes out on the 25th on the Xbox 360, and that's pretty much the only release you have to look forward to over there.
3353857	3360940	On the PlayStation 3, on the 18th, there is Chojigan Game Neptune.
3361440	3361900	I don't even know.
3361940	3362661	What the heck is this?
3362681	3363962	It's from Idea Factory.
3365202	3371526	And it is the evil witch Magikon is back and GameGalio World falls into chaos.
3372206	3377169	The shops ran out of business, the creators are starving, and most of the children are worshipping Magikon as a goddess.
3377910	3378510	So what is this?
3378530	3385634	This is a collaboration between Gust, Nippon Ichi, 5BP, KI Concept, Idea Factory, and Compile Heart.
3385654	3386235	That's a lot of...
3386835	3387415	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3407091	3415477	on the Wii, but on the PSP, Amnesia, I do not believe that is the same Amnesia that scares the shit out of people on the PC here.
3415838	3419440	There's a scary-ass game on the PC called Amnesia that's in Steam and stuff.
3419480	3420481	It's not the same game.
3421242	3421842	This is a...
3423263	3437965	Artsy Anime type of game that's available on the PSP and there's lots of kissing like look they're making out these two are gonna make out and he's probably dreaming about somebody making out with him like there's just lots of kissy kissy in this game so
3439546	3442648	That's an adventure game on the PSP if you like kissy kissy stuff.
3443389	3447472	Growlancer 4 Over Reloaded also comes out on the PSP this week.
3448313	3451275	Boy, there's really just not a lot to get excited about right now.
3451295	3452896	They're already on the fourth one?
3453257	3453477	Yes.
3453877	3457781	Wow That's it for Japanese releases How about UK?
3458101	3478299	A few On the 17th we have Cubix HD From Dust for PC From Ubisoft Toy Soldier Civil War And on the 19th we have Xenoblade Chronicles For Wii That's it Xenoblade Chronicles might be of interest to some people A few, maybe
3480265	3491230	I wouldn't be surprised if some of the Operation Rainfall people are like, okay, this week you have to buy a Wii system from the UK and buy Xenoblade just to show that we want it here.
3493631	3494251	Just wait for it.
3495615	3497196	Moving on, more news.
3497216	3501177	A couple more news stories for you guys in the classic game of the week coming up in just a little bit here.
3503278	3507099	So, a little more news about THQ.
3507139	3510261	We talked last week how they weren't too happy about...
3511241	3514545	THQ is not going to actively pursue development of the MX vs ATV franchise
3529805	3548946	and they were saying their latest game was kind of an experiment although it was a failed experiment and unfortunately releasing the title at a budget price didn't spur the extra sales they were hoping to make up on the back end with DLC and it was kind of not a good thing.
3549526	3552727	I'm not going to continue on with that franchise.
3553707	3556648	Also, they've let go of 200 people.
3559749	3564211	They're shifting their development focus away from kids and licensed titles.
3564871	3575358	which I gotta admit, other than the WWE games and the occasional Saints Row and stuff like that, they do a lot of fucking kids games.
3576619	3584544	You probably won't see the shift away from it this holiday because they have a lot of fucking kids games coming out other than Saints Row and WWE.
3585224	3592929	Lots of U-Draw stuff, lots of the Marvel Super Heroes Squad, Chibi Marvel stuff, and
3594628	3597410	and Spongebob and all the Nicktoons stuff.
3599391	3599591	Yeah.
3601292	3603033	So it's good that they're getting away from that.
3603693	3604514	Oh, imagine that.
3604614	3607515	All those little shuffleware games didn't do so well at the end of the day.
3608496	3608856	Yeah.
3609537	3609897	Too bad.
3610637	3610917	All right.
3611358	3617201	Moving on to, I guess I was joking about this earlier, but we do have a story about the whole Xenoblade and so forth.
3617241	3620223	It is coming out, of course, in Europe very soon, as DarkSakura just said.
3621444	3624788	Reggie Fils-Aimé made a comment to IGN this week about Xenoblade Chronicles.
3625169	3628033	Quote, we will be watching very closely what happens in Europe.
3628433	3637345	Certainly if there are business opportunities and positive consumer uptake from some of those titles, that will be great data for us to consider as we look at what to do with these titles.
3638649	3651640	Boy, if that's not a run-around-the-bush answer, if I've ever heard one, that's a, I'm not fucking telling you that the game is confirmed for here, I'm just gonna bullshit you with some of, that was the biggest pound of bullshit I've ever heard.
3652240	3653261	Something smells.
3653361	3654302	Yeah, so, whatever.
3654322	3655523	It's not Shermie's ass.
3655723	3656104	Whatever.
3656564	3662109	So, like, it's the nicest possible way he can say, please buy the game in Europe, but it doesn't mean we're gonna put it out here.
3662969	3664451	That pile of bullshit was like 400 Keurig.
3664471	3664851	Ha ha ha ha!
3669136	3670858	Anyhow, Operation Rainfall.
3670898	3672640	That doesn't stop Operation Rainfall.
3672660	3678105	They're not going to take no for an answer, not even for Reggie Fils-Aimé, who didn't really say no, but he didn't really say yes either.
3678906	3680948	Operation Rainfall is starting Phase 2.
3681669	3682670	Kicking it up a notch.
3683691	3685393	Phase 2, we're stepping it up.
3685413	3686915	We're going to get these fucking games out here.
3687694	3689615	So would this be considered Plan B?
3689935	3697820	Yes, this is Plan B. So here's Plan B. It's going to coincide with the August 19th launch of Xenoblade Chronicles in Europe.
3698380	3707225	To all residents in the regions of Europe and Oceania, says the organizers of Operation Rainfall, we encourage you to preorder and purchase it at your earliest convenience.
3707845	3711187	In the Americas, we encourage you to promote awareness of these titles.
3711588	3715651	Good sales abroad will be a strong indicator for the title making it to American shores.
3715791	3719333	So, you know, tell people in Europe to go buy the fucking game and buy it now.
3719654	3723496	Don't buy it used, buy it new so they get the sales, you know, try to sell a lot of copies of that game.
3723656	3724437	And send us a copy.
3724877	3726639	Now, yeah, hey, we'll take that.
3727079	3728920	But I wanted, oh wait, we couldn't play it on anything.
3730061	3732843	Do you have a, do you have a, oh wait, you have a region free Wii, don't you?
3733143	3733423	Well...
3735547	3736228	Sort of.
3737189	3737569	Fair enough.
3739430	3743654	Also, they're going to be sending a rally of letters to Nintendo of America.
3743674	3749099	You're supposed to mail them from August 13th to August 17th so that they all get there about the same time.
3749539	3754804	This kind of reminds me of when everybody sent the peanuts to CBS to try and save Jericho.
3754844	3756065	But they're just sending letters.
3757225	3758505	You need to send something.
3758825	3760646	You need to not just send a letter.
3760746	3764026	You need to send something with it.
3764146	3767067	Instead of peanuts, what's something that they could send for Xenoblade?
3767427	3769007	Switchblades.
3769748	3770508	Boxcutters.
3773488	3774528	No, don't do that.
3774889	3775529	We're just kidding.
3775569	3776149	Don't do that.
3776189	3776649	Good lord.
3777669	3779909	They will look at you at the post office funny if you do that.
3783559	3785440	Send them hand-drawn pictures of knives.
3787081	3787701	No, don't do that.
3787741	3788162	Don't do that.
3789602	3789923	Let's see.
3790363	3791223	What could you send?
3791503	3792924	I have to turn that over to the chat room.
3793204	3797907	That would remind somebody of Xenoblade or I guess you could say The Last Story or Pandora's Tower.
3798487	3800789	Is there like some other factor?
3801109	3803130	Get a whole bunch of copies of Xenogears.
3804557	3806038	from PlayStation the best?
3806798	3808139	I don't know.
3809240	3810720	What about like letter X's?
3811441	3817844	Like they should cut out the letter X from all their magazines and put them in an envelope so that when they open it up, just X's fly everywhere.
3818245	3819685	And the X means Xenoblade.
3819946	3820766	How about bees?
3822507	3822807	No.
3824228	3825769	Because the bees would fly everywhere.
3829144	3830826	It's a little more daring.
3831026	3831586	Alright, fine.
3831706	3833408	I don't want to open the rest of those letters.
3833468	3835310	They're all buzzing over there.
3838373	3841916	I just thought it was the one, but I'm pretty sure there's bees in all of those.
3843858	3846120	This package is buzzing and it's angry.
3847721	3849023	Make it stop, Reggie.
3852492	3853574	Fine, send them bees.
3853834	3854155	All right.
3854215	3858522	I'm pretty sure bees wouldn't survive the trip, though, but you could try.
3858703	3859664	Put holes in the box.
3861067	3862289	Oh, we're sending in a box?
3863130	3864452	You can fit a lot of bees in a box.
3867253	3868294	Don't send them bees!
3887105	3887866	Here's what you need to do.
3888006	3894610	If you want to just beat the shit out of a water right now, buy Nintendo stock and then complain as an investor.
3894751	3895751	That's what you need to do.
3895791	3904197	If you really want to kick Nintendo in the balls right now, become an investor of Nintendo stock and then say, as an investor, I feel that you need to bring Xenoblade out.
3904317	3906599	And from what I hear, the stock prices keep dropping.
3907400	3908681	It's going to be cheap real soon.
3910642	3912503	Okay, now the chatroom has a great suggestion.
3912603	3913584	Send them porn.
3913904	3916205	Because when you think X, it's XXX.
3916506	3918247	Yeah, that's not going to work.
3918827	3919508	Send them porn.
3920448	3924371	Send them... What is it?
3924491	3928834	Frisbee in chat says, each one of these stings is how you make us feel.
3932344	3935272	Sorry, because you know I'm thinking of that GIF that's out there on the internet.
3935292	3938340	The animated GIF file of Oprah opening the box.
3938420	3939323	It says, Bees!
3939403	3940305	It was on the Conan show.
3941673	3943014	TigerClaw, find me that gif.
3943614	3944455	Post it in chat.
3944475	3945516	That's even better.
3945756	3947277	You send it like the Riddler.
3947337	3949959	You know how the Riddler would send you little boxes with question marks on it?
3950339	3954201	But they have a box with a question mark on it in the Mario universe.
3954282	3956423	It fits, and you fit that with the bees.
3956463	3957043	That's good.
3957364	3962787	Or you can have the treasure chest from Zelda, so when they open it, it's all, do-do-do-do, bees!
3968737	3971580	And then the note says, each of these stings is how you make us feel.
3972406	3973167	or Bees in a Jar.
3973527	3974708	Just like, you know, Zelda.
3975989	3979711	It's all... I'm really going with the bees here.
3979751	3980932	I think the bees are a really good idea.
3980972	3982313	Oh god, they keep sending bees!
3982453	3984615	Throw them in the fountain and see if you get super bees.
3985936	3986777	Super bees.
3987057	3987557	Alright, look.
3988018	3989078	There's more to this story.
3989138	3990239	Shut up about the bees already.
3990659	3990940	Alright.
3991920	3996964	On August 19th, there's one more big thing that Operation Rainfall is going to be doing.
3996984	3997344	You ready?
3997965	4000407	As a show of an interest in RPGs,
4001148	4006906	Everybody on August 19th should purchase Final Fantasy on Virtual Console.
4008356	4037794	but if you already have it you should gift the money to somebody else or donate to Child's Play which I'm not going to make fun of that idea I think donating to Child's Play is always a good idea I'm not quite sure how that gets the point across that you want Xenoblade but okay whatever gets you to donate to a good charity that's fine as far as buying Final Fantasy on the virtual console I think your money might just be better spent giving the money to Child's Play in the name of bringing Xenoblade to the Wii
4039471	4050193	How is buying Final Fantasy on Virtual Console and increasing Square Enix's coffers going to prove to Reggie that we want Xenoblade?
4051873	4053454	Loki, can you help explain this to me?
4053474	4054434	Because I'm not understanding.
4056734	4063615	Well... They have blades in both of them.
4064335	4066876	And Square Enix made Xenogears...
4069232	4071413	And it's a terrible idea.
4072654	4073714	Because you know what's going to happen?
4073954	4076195	Because once again, this is the problem.
4077516	4088440	Yes, there's lots of people on forums, lots of people on forums that are complaining that Xenoblade is not coming to the United States.
4089141	4094363	But lots of people on forums also said, MadWorld is a fucking awesome game and I'm going to buy it.
4095563	4096184	See, that's the problem.
4096584	4100467	People on forums, you know what your numbers are, right?
4100587	4101748	You're not 100,000.
4102088	4104530	You're not maybe even 10,000.
4105071	4108914	And most people that post on forums that say they're going to buy it don't really buy it.
4108954	4109854	They end up pirating it.
4111015	4114938	You're maybe a few thousand people that want this game.
4115319	4119962	And I'm sorry, a game that only sells a few thousand copies is a failure.
4120222	4120523	So...
4122464	4147707	it's just not gonna happen you know what just save your money save your time wait for E3 next year and maybe they'll announce it but in the meantime if you really do want to spend like I don't know how much it is for Final Fantasy 7 bucks you can buy a lot of bees for seven dollars I'm telling you I think it's a great idea and you know what hey okay fine if you don't want to send them live bees because that might be a terrorist attack or terror threat or something like that
4148513	4150176	You know how they're all insensitive about that kind of stuff.
4150196	4151058	But bees pollinate!
4151699	4155767	You can send them like a chocolate-covered... They don't sell chocolate-covered bees, I'd imagine.
4157531	4160477	Maybe like... Pictures of bees?
4161407	4163248	Send them Mario with his head cut off.
4163348	4166689	I don't know.
4167509	4168669	Here's what you need to do.
4169089	4174391	Spend that $10 or whatever that you would have spent on Final Fantasy or whatever.
4175691	4178512	And donate it to charity and know that your money went to something good.
4178572	4179372	Or go buy lunch.
4179492	4183473	Or go just rent a porno or something like that.
4183573	4184613	Fucking chill the fuck out.
4184853	4186414	Because you're getting your...
4187034	4190378	All up in arms about like some... One damn game.
4190639	4192721	Oh, these are the best games on the Wii.
4192781	4193763	The best RPGs.
4194023	4195325	The Wii is over, okay?
4195385	4196286	The Wii is done.
4196526	4197567	It's pretty much done.
4198008	4201793	It's... You're just like trying to get this last good game out before the Wii is done.
4201913	4202674	It's done, okay?
4202874	4204296	They're going on to the Wii U.
4204875	4224669	so just get over it better games are out there better games will be coming out there so they didn't bring a hardcore game to the Wii even though they said oh we're catering to everybody just get over it they don't care about you they don't care what you want otherwise you know Earthbound would be out you know Earthbound 3 or Mother 3 or whatever the fuck that is
4224949	4227031	DarkTetsuya points out, you know, Mario did have a bee power-up in Mario Galaxy.
4247350	4247570	See?
4247690	4247990	Right there.
4248010	4249212	Nintendo loves bees.
4249692	4256019	I'm going to end this conversation on a comment that's about as good as this whole effort.
4257942	4262967	If you don't like bees because they fly around, it might be hard to catch.
4262987	4263428	Scorpions also work.
4263448	4263648	Stop it.
4266451	4270994	Alright, I'm going to end on this comment from our chatroom at chat.org You can get candy covered scorpions.
4271554	4272114	Those are safe.
4272394	4276737	Spazinator says, Nintendo would boil the bees to make BT.
4277437	4279838	I heard BT makes for a good buzz.
4286502	4288083	Just going to let that joke settle for a minute.
4290168	4291550	Let's go to the classic game of the week.
4293351	4304103	Every week here on Orange Lounge Radio, DarkSakura dives into the gaming vault and finds... Before we start, Breakman says, so Loki thinks trying to hurt the developers is a better idea than trying to bribe them.
4305164	4307807	We're not saying it to the developers, we're saying it to Nintendo.
4307907	4309168	We're not trying to hurt them.
4309469	4312192	The developers are far away, safe from the bees.
4315451	4338857	by the way, I believe DarkSakura posted that gif on Tumblr for those that are listening on the podcast I like having the Tumblr so when funny shit comes up on the show we can talk about it on Tumblr remove that thing that cross posts everything to Twitter though I don't think I ever set that up it's doing it see if you can find it classic game of the week yay
4341338	4345180	DarkSakura goes in the classic gaming vault, finds a game she thinks, hey, you kids ought to be playing it this week.
4345980	4347721	Forget the last story.
4348362	4351083	This is the only story you fucking need.
4351103	4353284	DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week this week?
4353484	4355405	Warcraft 3, Reign of Chaos.
4356466	4356766	Addict?
4357206	4361108	No, not really, because I don't like real-time strategy games.
4361588	4362728	But I'm trying to play it.
4363469	4367230	I'm trying to, so I thought I would bring it up.
4368470	4370711	This is, of course, the third in a row.
4371171	4377753	The first one was Warcraft Orcs and Humans, and the second one was Tides of Darkness, and this one's Reign of Chaos.
4377773	4379693	Oops, sorry.
4379733	4385895	The music one that I put up there is actually from the expansion, The Frozen Throne.
4386155	4386415	Okay.
4386435	4386595	Okay.
4387228	4393532	So, uh, yeah, it did come out, um, and it had, um, it actually was released on July 3rd, 2002.
4394393	4400057	And it's the second sequel to, um, you know, as I said, Warcraft, Orcs, and Humans.
4400957	4404880	Um, it had an expansion pack called the Frozen Drone that came out on July 1st, 2003.
4405600	4407582	So you have four playable races this time.
4407602	4411564	You have Orcs and Humans, um, and you also have Night Elves and Undead.
4412725	4415987	And, uh, it's sort of laid out like StarCraft.
4418248	4422029	You also have other races in the expansion.
4422049	4427931	You get the Draenei and the Naga, who are really elves.
4429051	4429651	They suck.
4430351	4432532	Anyway, you've got multiplayer.
4432892	4434032	You can play on the internet.
4434212	4437533	You can play against the computer.
4437673	4442214	You can even later on mod your levels and do customized levels.
4443915	4463004	The proper storylines basically is if you've done the orc campaign on Warcraft and the human campaigns on Warcraft 2, so that would be Tides of Darkness and Beyond the Dark Portal, then those lead into Warcraft 3.
4464105	4476814	So it sold 4.5 million units, well shipped I should say, and it sold over a million within a month and it is one of the game beer ones listed.
4476954	4481617	So basically it's a, you know, like I said, real time strategy.
4482317	4487601	You have the stuff called the Black Mask that covers places that you haven't explored but when you explore it goes away.
4488001	4499489	But if you move too far away, then you get the fog of war, which makes you can't see what troops are doing and what building construction is going on, but you can still see the terrain.
4500089	4504292	I call that saving space for, you know, rendering, but that's another story.
4506674	4508615	So you have to get your different resources.
4508715	4510576	You need gold, lumber, and food.
4511977	4539242	and um you have to have those to make buildings and then food determines the number of units you can control at any given time so basically the more troops you can feed the more you can have out and play you also have creeps which are controlled by the computer and they guard different areas like gold mines and buildings um you can kill them for gold experience and special items and you have a day night cycle that was also introduced for this game um
4540543	4540863	DarkSakura.com
4558067	4558928	Limitations as well.
4560349	4563872	So, with this one, you also get something called Heroes.
4564673	4570618	So, when you have an enemy unit killed, your hero will gain experience points and can level up as far as 10.
4571599	4575542	And they also get new spells, kind of gets like an RPG element to it.
4576583	4580847	And they can boost their units that way, and they'll get ultimate skills!
4580907	4581367	Horrible.
4582148	4584269	So basically, you've got your different campaign modes.
4584309	4591431	You've got five campaigns, including the prologue, that introduces the different races.
4591471	4594972	There's two orc campaigns, one human, one undead, and one night elf.
4595572	4597992	They have different chapters, which are kind of like your missions.
4598893	4603094	But you do not have briefings, as you did in the earlier games.
4603614	4606075	It just sort of comes out in a series of quests.
4606975	4611016	And the story unfolds through cinematics and cutscenes.
4612137	4615402	and you get your different objectives as you progress through the game.
4615502	4618707	Kind of like how World of Warcraft is doing now.
4620369	4623794	It seems to me it's exactly a good transition.
4624876	4625496	So anyway...
4627990	4630452	Thanks for watching!
4647708	4651312	You can go against your friends and other people on Battle.net.
4651332	4653254	You had different gateways.
4653795	4665348	You had your Azeroth, which was the eastern U.S., Lorydron, which was the west United States, Northrend for Europe, and Kalimdor for Asia.
4666209	4666429	So...
4667851	4672154	You could actually play anonymously with other people.
4672494	4673615	It's called matchmaking.
4674576	4677818	So you could have different battles against random people.
4678719	4684183	And then there were also scores and standings that were marked on the ladder.
4685204	4687746	So as far as the game goes, I'm not going to tell too much of the story.
4688546	4690768	I prefer to paraphrase it as Arthas is a bitch.
4691909	4692389	Don't you think?
4693931	4694491	About sums it up.
4695999	4708266	Arthas decides he's going to get all big and bad and burn a bunch of people to death and then get some sword and give his soul up for his sword and then become the Lich King's bitch.
4709707	4719953	And then he does a whole bunch of awful shit like, you know, killing his dad and killing a bunch of other people and turning Sylvanas into, you know, a banshee and...
4720513	4721956	All kinds of other crap.
4722197	4727267	So, yeah, it's basically Arthas is a bitch, the game.
4728887	4752408	but you also find a few people that went to MIA in earlier games what happened to them and of course for anyone who's playing World of Warcraft now pretty much all these characters that were in this game play into you can find them in World of Warcraft or they've been dead and are affecting the game but it's all built on what went on in this game
4754182	4755643	Um, it has great sound.
4755683	4759444	You could actually, if you got the limited edition, it came with a soundtrack.
4760604	4765086	Uh, there are different types of, uh, you know, music for the different, uh, races.
4765126	4769887	Like the one that I just, we were just hearing was the Night Elf theme, which is pretty good music.
4770927	4771047	Um.
4773188	4775369	It's at the end though, so I'm going to switch to the Undead music.
4775869	4775949	Okay.
4775969	4776089	Okay.
4778294	4786261	So, and like I said, you could also, there was a world editor that you could change different events and change different things.
4786381	4798230	You could download each other's maps, and there were also third-party developers that had different tools that came out, like different spreadsheets and customizing skins, all kinds of different cool stuff.
4799271	4812418	So basically the game, there was this epic bundle that came with the soundtrack, instruction manual, the Art of Warcraft book, and lithographic prints.
4813539	4819742	And you could also get the battle chest, which had Reign of Chaos with the Frozen Throne in box.
4820482	4821884	and the guides from Brady Games.
4821924	4826148	There was also an exclusive gift set that had a cinematic DVD and a bunch of other crap.
4827148	4835837	And there was also, for anyone who played Warcraft the board game, it actually was based heavily off of Warcraft 3.
4837597	4850159	It got a 93.09% at GameRankings.com and basically it's just considered one of the greatest game, I'd say modern games of all time.
4850319	4852020	So, there you go.
4853640	4853980	Alright.
4854560	4857181	There it is folks, your classic game of the week, Warcraft 3.
4858101	4858901	Arthas is a bitch.
4859701	4864502	Arthas is a bitch and as SalaciousPop says in chat, Arthas is a bitch and Illidan needs to stop listening to Linkin Park.
4865042	4865322	Yes!
4866872	4867332	There you go.
4867733	4870534	All right, that's going to do it for Part A here of Orange Launch Radio.
4870554	4871395	But don't go anywhere, guys.
4871415	4873376	We've got plenty more to come of the show tonight.
4874117	4883343	We're going to move into Part B, talk a little bit about Google+, more Nintendo news, and, of course, Mailbag, FUs, tweets, and calls, all when we come back with more of Orange Launch Radio.
4889355	4891736	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
4891796	4902819	We are live, of course, on this Sunday evening, August the 14th of 2011, with the 424th episode of our show, taping live at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.
4902839	4911602	You missed a fun Part A that was full of Bs, but we are going to continue on with Part B of our show right now, and we're going to start off with some rapid-fire news.
4911722	4912042	Loki.
4912722	4913682	This game is hard.
4914002	4914383	Anyways.
4914703	4915443	What game?
4915463	4917243	Oh, you're still playing VVVVV over there, right?
4917644	4919024	Yes, I had to dodge the lies.
4919984	4944578	Um, so this is interesting, uh, Kojima, of course, during his podcast, they had done, um, a Snatcher Universe radio drama, which was, I guess, entitled Suda51's, uh, Sedature, um, and it's now being offered as a free download, and if you want something a little bit more physical, you can get a CD that'll be sold later on, um, I guess to pay the voice actors, um,
4945438	4970727	and I guess the voice drum also featured a lot of the people that did voices in Metal Gear so that's kind of cool and so yeah check that out and if you're looking for more information on that I believe you can just check out his actual podcast it's www.kjp.kanami.jp and I think it's the Hideo blog on there
4972147	4987330	Um, Motorstorm Apocalypse is getting a brand new update and they're adding make a mode support, which I guess allows you to customize, you know, the vehicles, um, and some of the other options that are in the game.
4988210	4992991	Um, you can tweak everything, including you can just, that's awesome.
4993411	4996551	Uh, you can disable brakes, you can disable gravity.
4997852	5000052	Um, sweet, a racing game with no brakes.
5000072	5000372	Yeah.
5000672	5001553	Sounds kind of cool.
5002894	5004495	So I'd have to check that out.
5004815	5011621	They also added PlayStation Move support for, I guess, if you wanted to do the old Wii steering type thing on there.
5013062	5016745	I don't know if I'd recommend that, but, you know, that option's there at least.
5018086	5019327	So that's out there now.
5019487	5021689	So just connect to the internet and pop in the game.
5023867	5029431	and then Child of Eden unfortunately has been delayed a week but I think it's kind of cool because they're getting 3D support now.
5029871	5032493	So you'll be able to check out the game September 27th.
5032533	5034895	It's PlayStation 3 though, right?
5034995	5036696	The PlayStation 3 version, yes.
5036976	5039158	And of course it will feature move controls as well which I...
5040359	5043123	To be honest, I think that's going to be way better than what the Kinect was.
5044405	5046668	I would be kind of curious to check it out on the PS3.
5047449	5051234	But 3D, man, I can only imagine that game is going to be just amazing.
5051255	5053538	Yeah, it's going to be kind of a trip in 3D.
5055240	5058403	Do I know anyone with a 3D TV and a PlayStation 3?
5058763	5060545	I can't think of anyone off the top of my head.
5061125	5064428	3D televisions haven't exactly cracked into the mainstream.
5064448	5065509	We have one in my work.
5066330	5067491	It's actually a Sony TV.
5067611	5069893	I've really contemplated getting one of those monitors, though.
5069913	5070553	I'm not gonna lie.
5071514	5072275	They're pretty decent.
5072315	5073196	I mean, it's about that big.
5073576	5075817	Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker
5102246	5105727	It will have a download code, however, for the first Metal Gear Solid.
5105767	5107668	I don't believe it's up-resed or anything like that, though.
5107688	5109989	It's just pretty much the original PlayStation game.
5110429	5119453	Now, the overseas version, which would include the one that's going to come out in America, it will not have the download for the first Metal Gear Solid, but it will have the HD version of Peace Walker.
5119793	5122134	So, I don't know why the difference is, but there you go.
5123254	5128376	Also of note, Metal Gear Solid 3 HD is going to be the subsistence version of the game.
5128756	5131157	It has the user control camera and all that stuff.
5131977	5136659	It also has emulated MSX versions of Metal Gear 1 and 2.
5137500	5141781	That's pretty awesome because that was all the subsistence versions of Metal Gear Solid 3 had that.
5141821	5143582	So that's pretty rad.
5143742	5151565	I don't know if that means that we'll see them here in America because those games were never translated to English because the MSX was never out in America.
5151646	5153346	So I don't know how that's all going to work.
5153386	5154267	It's going to be very interesting.
5154287	5157268	I really hope we can play those games in their original MSX format.
5159609	5164031	Oh, by the way, there's a huge difference between Metal Gear 2 and Snakes Revenge, by the way, if you didn't know that.
5164411	5169173	Snakes Revenge was completely done in America, and Kojima was not involved with that at all.
5169773	5176776	But there was an official Metal Gear 2, I'm not talking solid, Metal Gear 2 on the MSX oh so many years ago.
5177156	5177796	We never saw it here.
5178416	5179357	There are fan translations.
5180297	5185158	Maybe, well, I don't think they'd use a fan translation, but I would, man, I really hope the MSX version show up.
5185218	5185538	We'll see.
5185898	5190979	Anyhow, Metal Gear Solid 2 HD release would also be based on Subsistence.
5192060	5196581	I guess he really meant to say the Substance version of the game because there wasn't a Subsistence, but whatever.
5197541	5197921	Don't know.
5198001	5198981	No, what's Subsistence?
5199541	5200081	Subsistence.
5200241	5200521	Was it?
5200661	5200841	Yeah.
5201362	5201782	Well, whatever.
5202182	5207603	Anyhow, those games will be in HD and we'll have all the trophy support and all that good stuff.
5208403	5211305	A game that you might have forgot about, but it's still coming, you know, eventually.
5211665	5213246	Sonic 4, Episode 2.
5214187	5214547	Remember?
5214567	5219130	Because there was Sonic 4, Episode 1, and it kind of came out, and the whole internet was all, no one care.
5219950	5225494	A lot of people thought that Sonic 4 was pretty much dead, now that, you know, Sonic Generations is kind of going and so forth.
5225854	5231898	But nope, Sega West CEO Mike Hayes said that new info regarding the second chapter should be out soon.
5233627	5235731	No date, just soon.
5235971	5238275	Just basically saying, hey, the game hasn't fallen off the radar.
5238355	5240519	It will come out, you know, eventually.
5240960	5246549	He did mention that episode one did get a million downloads across all the platforms, so it didn't do that bad.
5247955	5261302	A game that should have done a hell of a lot better than it did was Rock Band 3 and a company is taking a second chance on the game because, you know, I guess MTV Games isn't really around anymore so you can't really get new Rock Band 3.
5262062	5269726	Well, Mad Catz is going to be basically re-releasing Rock Band 3 this holiday with their peripherals.
5269906	5274988	It's a really weird type of thing to see a company come in and pick up a game for a re-release like that.
5275108	5276569	Yeah, but they did the official peripherals.
5276849	5278550	Guitar Controller Version and Drum Kit Version
5294179	5294479	DarkSakura
5317270	5325433	Well, for fans of SingStar, there is a new version to be coming out calling SingStar Back to the 80s and it'll be out sometime before Christmas.
5326033	5328034	Has 30 massive hits.
5328114	5328994	Now, I gotta ask.
5329714	5331935	Is it gonna have the song Back to the 80s?
5333696	5334456	Like by Aqua?
5334616	5334956	Yeah.
5335256	5335717	I doubt it.
5335737	5336777	That wasn't an 80s song.
5336817	5339098	But it'd be cool though.
5339118	5341219	But it's gonna have Whitesnake and Devo.
5341539	5343319	It might be for sale on the SingStore.
5344200	5344940	And maybe Meatloaf.
5346437	5349441	Thanks for the members Thanks for the members
5363058	5364700	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5384797	5395044	And moving forward, we have for North America on September 9th, the Flame Red 3DS will be out.
5395244	5395845	It's flaming.
5396545	5397025	Yes, it is.
5397305	5403029	Actually, I like... There was a DS in that exact same color, wasn't there?
5405351	5407272	I like the name in Japan, though.
5407292	5408033	It's Flare Red.
5408793	5409714	I think that's kind of cool.
5410394	5412295	Anyway, it's a 3DS and it's red and black.
5412916	5413236	The end.
5414725	5415025	All right.
5416566	5424749	By the way, guys, before we get back to some more long-form news, I do want to give one more shout-out for the indie game Spotlight that we're going to be doing on the show.
5425109	5427350	Haven't had a whole lot of bites on that, so I don't know.
5427370	5429590	I guess we must not have a lot of developers listen to the show.
5429630	5435813	But again, if you or a friend are developing an independently produced game, either for iOS, PC...
5437933	5465143	Xbox Live Arcade or you know pretty much anything we'll take a look at it and maybe invite you on the show to talk about it and hopefully get you noticed because right now one of the biggest bitches we're hearing about that is it's really hard to get noticed on Xbox Live Arcade because A. Microsoft doesn't really highlight a lot of the indie stuff and B. a lot of it is crap there's a lot of crap out there but there are a few good things and if you believe you have a diamond in the rough we want to call it out here on this program
5465703	5480324	so coming soon to the program and if we don't get a lot of developers to bite on that we'll just kind of start spotlighting stuff we like and that's where we'll go with it because we're committed to helping indie games get more acknowledgement because after all we're an indie podcast and we know it can be tough
5481305	5482646	Also, I want to give a plug.
5482666	5489351	Speaking of any podcast to another show that we do here at OLR Network, it is Horde House.
5489491	5490752	The best little Horde House in Azeroth.
5491312	5499057	www.hordehouse.com If you like World of Warcraft, there's all sorts of fun stuff about WoW on that program.
5499097	5500838	This week especially was a really fun show.
5501499	5503320	We taped on an off day this week.
5503460	5506302	We had a guy from Britain on the show and it was fun.
5506382	5508403	Rice Princess crashed the show about halfway through.
5508423	5509864	I guess she's not Rice Princess anymore.
5509904	5510605	I'm supposed to call her Irene.
5511025	5512166	She'll always be Rice Princess to me.
5512646	5517489	She crashed the show about halfway through, and we were talking about PvP for a little while, so it was cool.
5517709	5518069	Good show.
5518529	5519069	Let's check it out.
5519310	5520230	Is she having withdrawals?
5521631	5528014	It doesn't sound like it, but it was still nice to have her perspective, even though she's pretty comfortable in her decision to quit.
5528054	5535198	But I think, you know what's funny is that most people that were on the show this week are on a bit of hiatus, but all of them were like, yeah, I'll come back eventually.
5535578	5538520	And even Picaruno, who is our guest over from overseas, is like,
5538780	5539100	DarkSakura.com
5566533	5566993	Girls Gone Wow.
5591525	5610641	But they are lovely people and they thank you for the biscuits Awesome Yes, it's .net, girlsgonewild.net So check them out, I was on episode 25 and Rob will be on episode 26 Hooray Alright, lots of Warcraft stuff We also had a little bit of Doctor Who discussion We do more than Warcraft, I promise Oh really?
5610961	5619228	Yeah Fun It came up a little bit Fun Alright, the new show has nothing to do with Warcraft It is very much not about Warcraft, I'll say that much
5619908	5621789	If Dan's involved, it's not about Warcraft.
5621809	5622210	Exactly.
5622530	5627653	All right, let's get back into some more long-form news, and Loki's going to start us off.
5628173	5628833	Yes, I am.
5629154	5631115	Why don't I take a break here from this game?
5631255	5632316	You and that VVVVV.
5632656	5633396	Hey, I'm getting pretty far.
5634857	5640240	So Google Plus has started doing some games, and this is not a big surprise.
5640260	5641361	We kind of knew this was going to happen.
5642081	5645864	And of course, their rollout is a little bit like what we thought.
5646224	5654930	They're going to have a separate game section so you can play your games and all the updates for those games are on one section.
5655390	5657952	They don't clutter up your feed or whatever.
5658772	5666338	So of course, they're going to start off with Angry Birds, Dragon Age Legends, Sudoku, stuff of that sort.
5667218	5668639	And you can check it out.
5668679	5671461	They're going to be starting to roll out some more stuff.
5672142	5675086	Yes, in the great Google tradition, not everybody had it right away.
5675566	5677950	I got mine the day after this was announced, though.
5679071	5681114	I play Bejeweled Blitz on Google Games.
5681134	5684478	I guess I forgot to say that at the top of the show, but I play Bejeweled Blitz on Google Games.
5684979	5689365	And I gotta say, I love that the game stuff is just on a separate frickin' page.
5689645	5704112	And it sounds like that they're trying to be a little bit more of kind of a destination for these developers because they're offering, you know, the commissions that they're taking from these games are a lot less than, say, Facebook.
5704412	5710475	For example, VentureBee is reporting that Google is only taking a 5% commission on its games, whereas Facebook takes 30.
5711496	5715938	So, I mean, that might be a little bit more beneficial for some of these developers out there.
5716058	5716498	You know what, though?
5716578	5721141	I honestly think it's going to get harder to be noticed on Google Games because they don't clutter your feed.
5721201	5726644	I mean, I honestly think part of the reason why Farmville was so successful was that it did spam the shit out of everybody.
5727004	5729046	And people who didn't know better, i.e.
5729106	5733148	soccer moms, started playing it because they saw, oh, Ethel's playing this game.
5733228	5734129	I should play it, too.
5734769	5738751	So, you know, I think that's a lot of how those games became so successful.
5738992	5742594	So it's going to be interesting to see if the Google Games model is successful because, honestly...
5743214	5751685	How is going to a different page to see your game content any better than, I don't know, MSN Zone is a Microsoft site where you can play games.
5751785	5753727	But I bet a lot of people don't really play there.
5753968	5759975	Going to a different page, how different is that going to a different website to play your games?
5760095	5760556	Exactly.
5760716	5761197	I know, I know.
5761557	5764439	But I will say this to Google's credit, it's clean.
5764939	5767601	Like, I feel like when I go to Zone MSN, it's very cluttered.
5767641	5769622	There's ads everywhere, blah, blah, blah, you know?
5770123	5772804	It's a cluttered website full of clutter.
5773245	5775646	But Google Games, I thought, is pretty slick.
5775706	5776047	Like, you know...
5776987	5780789	One of the things people either love or they hate about Google Plus is that it's very plain.
5781390	5784191	There's not a lot of flair to it right now.
5784231	5785732	It's a very plain looking site.
5786072	5788394	They don't really have ads at all right now.
5788874	5790255	I don't know how long that's going to last.
5791135	5794677	So it's a very clean site and the games site kind of carries that on.
5796158	5801023	I did notice that Bejeweled Blitz was kind of skinned for Google Games.
5801103	5803505	I mean, it looks like it was very specific towards that.
5803585	5806268	So I didn't play anything else.
5806288	5808710	That's the only one I played, but I'm down with it.
5808950	5812474	I'm going to check out more Google Games if they get some more stuff I want to play.
5812514	5815156	Like, I don't know, Civ World could come out.
5815176	5815737	That'd be great.
5816357	5816998	I'd be into that.
5817879	5818199	We'll see.
5820040	5822921	Anyhow, go into our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
5824521	5828082	Blakeman is talking about Dragon Age and all that.
5828222	5832824	It should be illegal to use games like Dragon Age in the same sentence as Angry Birds.
5833524	5836665	Believe it or not, Dragon Age Legends is one of the launch games.
5837085	5837985	I've never played that.
5838085	5840746	Is that like Knights of the Clicky or what?
5841320	5841660	I don't know.
5841760	5842861	I don't think it's like that.
5842881	5848884	I think it's more of like a simplified version, kind of like a Diablo-esque type thing.
5848944	5850124	That might actually be kind of fun.
5850244	5851005	I'll have to check that out.
5852045	5852445	Let's see.
5852545	5855947	Zether says, Bejeweled Blitz is good, but it only gives you one minute to play.
5856047	5857167	Well, that's kind of the point.
5857247	5859889	I like the little bite-sized version of Bejeweled there.
5859909	5860509	I kind of like it.
5861489	5861870	So there you go.
5866313	5867534	Moving on to other stuff.
5867874	5869276	This is another Nintendo story.
5869657	5870618	This is very interesting.
5871479	5872420	Very interesting patent.
5873902	5874782	Thank you for watching!
5897630	5898831	GameSpot found the filing.
5898971	5906999	The MSO, I guess, would be an environment where your actions and choices affect the world that they and everyone else live in.
5907680	5909481	So, for example, an economic system.
5910202	5914346	Or maybe a case where a player finds building materials and they make a house.
5914726	5917669	Then all the other players are going to see the house, just not the owner.
5917849	5920172	And I'm imagining they're not going to see the material either.
5921153	5928660	I guess there's an idea too where players would gossip to an AI non-player character who spreads it to other characters in the world.
5929001	5935908	And of course that instantly made my brain go, oh, it's Animal Crossing, which I'm sure a lot of people are thinking at this point.
5935968	5942815	Well, and not to say this is the first game that's been kind of single player, but yet had sort of the multiplayer tie like Demon's Souls.
5943035	5943475	Well, it's fine.
5943515	5945556	Bobby was talking about this on his show right before that.
5945576	5949577	He's like, I don't see why Nintendo – I guess I should properly plug his show.
5949617	5953338	He's always before us here at All Games Radio, but he's on at 5 Pacific.
5953378	5957959	BobbyBlackWolf at BobbyBlackWolf.com was talking about this subject tonight a little more in depth on his show.
5958279	5961660	And he said, I can think of two right off the top of my head that already do this.
5961680	5964301	And he said Demon's Souls, and the other one was –
5966673	5967553	I fucking forgot.
5967693	5970375	It was a PC game.
5970995	5973316	And it's going to come to me as soon as somebody yells it out in chat.
5973696	5975537	I can't remember what the other one was, but there's another game.
5975577	5976657	Random game on the PC.
5977898	5979018	That was exactly like it.
5979278	5987742	I think he was saying, he was trying to say Diablo 3 was kind of part of this too, where Diablo 3 has a single player mode, but yet it's going to have this auction house that's more massive.
5988442	5993565	So it's interesting that Nintendo would be getting a patent on this when it's kind of already been done.
5993725	5995686	And can they really do that, IDK?
5997086	5998687	Well, especially if the patent was in 2010.
5998727	5999487	Demon's Souls came out in 2010.
6003444	6004284	Fable Spore
6024091	6034197	But yes, Spore was very much, remember, you would make your little monster and then it kind of went off into the Spore universe and the universe was made up of other creatures that other people had made.
6034217	6035838	But you never play the game with these people.
6036198	6037819	It's just that the players made the environment.
6038159	6041501	And that game was out in 08, I think.
6042182	6050467	And to a lesser extent, you could even say that the Wii with people's Miis because you share the Miis and they pop up in games sometimes.
6050767	6050967	Mm-hmm.
6054741	6056643	Anyhow, let's see.
6057203	6058585	What else do I want to say about this patent?
6059106	6064652	More, the filing talks about how the game has to be suitable for play on something called the Wii 3D.
6066735	6071979	This was filed, of course, in 2010, so maybe at one point the Wii U was going to be the Wii 3D.
6072600	6075042	Or the 3DS was the Wii 3D at one point.
6075362	6077343	Who knows, but don't read too far into that.
6077444	6079966	I'm sure this does not mean Wii 3D confirmed.
6080486	6086651	I'm sure that Nintendo explores a lot of options about what they're going to do and files patents to cover their butt.
6087452	6087532	Um...
6089013	6097220	It's just interesting that Nintendo would go for something like this when, yeah, I think we have examples of other games that already kind of have done this.
6097300	6100823	So it would be a little bit crappy if Nintendo gets it.
6101163	6104226	I mean, only if Nintendo decides to go after these other developers.
6104847	6108630	But then again, if I were the company that made Demon's Souls from software, right?
6109471	6111512	I would be all like, F you, Nintendo.
6111572	6111833	We have...
6112713	6115254	This game was out a long time ago.
6115294	6118455	But just because they do that, though, can they still patent it?
6118835	6121916	Like if I come up with something but I don't patent it, then they do?
6122296	6125977	The whole patent system in this country is fucked up anyway.
6126017	6128857	And again, I'm going to defer to Bobby's show because he puts it better than I do.
6129297	6131238	But just talking about how...
6131798	6135399	It's ridiculous that you can patent all these software concepts.
6135519	6139881	And if you want to see the headache it's causing, just look at all this bullshit with LoadSys.
6140001	6142882	LoadSys is specifically a patent troll company.
6143102	6144163	There is no office.
6144503	6148464	There's nothing to LoadSys besides some troll.
6148704	6152626	Literally a troll sitting under the bridge begging for money.
6153406	6156407	Or demanding money, in this case, with their stock of patents.
6156907	6179307	and that's kind of screwed up you know something needs to be done patenting hardware that's a little different I get that but a lot of this software patent and the other example I know that Bobby always brings up again just to totally bite his show is the one click thing from Amazon it's ridiculous that Amazon has a patent on one click that whole one click to buy one click to purchase nobody else can do that Amazon has the patent on it that's ridiculous
6180948	6185610	In my opinion, you're patenting something that's kind of like a key functionality of the internet, a link.
6186150	6190773	I'm patenting the Q key.
6191333	6191813	That's right.
6192013	6195235	I patent device to create queue by pressing button.
6197648	6199670	Anyhow, it's interesting to see what comes out.
6199710	6200652	Of course, it's just a patent.
6201032	6203395	It doesn't mean New Animal Crossing confirmed.
6203515	6205937	I mean, those Animal Crossing games do sell.
6206198	6208440	New Animal Crossing confirmed, really?
6208600	6210122	They do sell pretty well, right?
6210142	6211704	Another system, another Animal Crossing.
6211724	6214006	I think you're going to see another Animal Crossing regardless.
6214647	6214727	Um...
6215908	6216949	It could be something.
6217009	6225314	I mean, we are assuming it's Animal Crossing, but to not assume it's Animal Crossing would be to then assume that Nintendo is doing something different.
6226154	6228555	I'm going to take the safer bet and say it's Animal Crossing.
6228575	6230156	I don't know about you guys.
6230677	6231857	Nintendo, different.
6232638	6235219	They just put different in the same packaging.
6235920	6238781	Blakeman in our chatroom says, you can be a professional troll.
6239261	6241683	Why was I not informed and where do I get an application?
6243976	6246577	I'm sorry, but Troll's more qualified than you have already applied.
6247977	6250718	Those doing the interviews were thoroughly insulted, therefore they were hired.
6252098	6254098	Alright, anyhow, let's move on with some more news.
6254879	6255719	Actually, no, the mailbag.
6255999	6256739	Mailbag's up now.
6257239	6257899	Let's get to it.
6258279	6264421	Every week here on Orange Lounge Radio, DarkSakura likes to open up the mail, dive in headfirst, and pull out some emails to read for you.
6264441	6264941	I like to.
6265741	6266401	You have to.
6268122	6269062	Because the music's playing.
6269602	6270322	So therefore you must.
6270382	6274084	Mailbag at orangelaundreater.com if you want to email us sometime.
6275065	6275685	Let's get to it.
6276106	6280788	I'm also going to again say that if you send multiple emails, I'm only going to read one of them.
6281388	6282389	So do not take offense.
6283089	6288192	That being said, the first... And if you send one email that's like 500 pages, she might trim it down too.
6288972	6289653	Or just not read it.
6290133	6291414	Or just put it on the forum or something.
6292114	6292875	Hi, OLR.
6293835	6296557	You've been talking about Capcom a lot lately, and it reminded me of something.
6296917	6300620	Back in 08 when I visited Japan, I made it a point to hunt down the Capcom building.
6301080	6308185	Though I couldn't read the website, I used Google to loosely translate the addresses on it until I found a likely one and had a cab take me to the building.
6309246	6310566	The guard there was pretty surprised.
6310626	6315810	My husband and I were looking around for maybe a store or something, but it was just a building with a big old Capcom logo on the side.
6316190	6321534	The guard asked us if we need help, and we told him we were tourists and wanted to see the Capcom building and if it had a gift shop or anything.
6322474	6326415	Well this card goes inside and brings back the public relations manager for Capcom Japan.
6326956	6331717	We thought it was so cool she kept apologizing that we'd gone out of our way to see the building and there wasn't a store or anything.
6332157	6334198	We told her it was still great and we love Okami.
6334618	6339420	She gave us folders about investing in Capcom and her business card so I thought I'd send it along to you here.
6340160	6341520	Just something cool you might like.
6341640	6343481	I'm not sure if she still works there now.
6344221	6346403	Here's a link to the pic on my DeviantArt page.
6346463	6347644	Sorry about the watermark.
6347684	6348645	Sometimes that gets fixed.
6348685	6350827	I swear DeviantArt randomly turns it on sometimes.
6351247	6353389	That's from Holly D. Oh my god, I love it.
6353469	6355851	Here's a pamphlet on investing in Capcom.
6358113	6358894	Hey, again.
6359214	6360155	There's the picture of the building.
6360396	6362357	I want to come look at this over here over your shoulder.
6362417	6364599	I guess we can't Tumblr these because these are private pictures.
6364799	6366441	It's on DeviantArt.
6366781	6367081	Chihotamoto
6393925	6394445	That's cute.
6395005	6396146	What's on the other page?
6396746	6397606	Is there a second page there?
6397706	6398306	There's another.
6398486	6399166	There's an image.
6399987	6400087	Oh.
6401447	6402947	That's her signature.
6403287	6405668	That's still kind of cool.
6405988	6406228	Yeah.
6406788	6408909	Let me see if there's anything else, though, included in this.
6409749	6413710	Nope, just the... I love that whole, here's some information if you want to invest in the company.
6414030	6419172	Which, you know, again, if you want to really get your point across, you should invest in a company.
6419212	6420472	You should invest in Capcom.
6421485	6421966	I bought a hoe
6435382	6437223	We bought it on the corner outside your building.
6437243	6438244	What'd you call me, Earl?
6440646	6450353	Dear Personages, After returning from my Vegas trip, during which I had a truly fun time, I gave myself an extra day to run errands and unwind just a little bit more.
6451113	6460640	One of the things I did was I called up my local Walmart, called up the Walmart that is also on the same road but slightly farther away from me, and found myself a $170 3DS.
6461200	6464723	I also got a game because a gaming system without a game is just an expensive paperweight.
6465063	6487346	much like my Sega Game Gear is now I've got Guardian Heroes on Game Gear and you probably don't anyway I'm not emailing you to gloat or be a braggart about my purchase I'm being a braggart but I just wanted to ask a question of you are any of you three aware of any pornographic websites that can be viewed on the Nintendo 3DS
6488647	6489348	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6518209	6519529	Let me Google that for you.
6520389	6524290	DarkSakura is going to search right now for... Nintendo 3DS boobs.
6525951	6528371	Why don't you just Google 3D porn?
6530111	6531232	3D website porn.
6533572	6534232	3DS porn.
6534692	6541234	There is actually a pack you can get that someone made that's a bunch of 3D pictures that you can upload to your device.
6541254	6542434	They're not pornographic, though.
6542454	6543014	They're just like,
6543857	6546898	Like sexy swimsuits and things like that?
6546919	6547319	Like lingerie.
6547439	6550240	It's some idol.
6551941	6555863	Well, then I'll leave it to the chat room to try and fill us in on some 3D porno.
6556670	6557931	But hey, you know what though?
6559211	6561053	There's people out there, they have 3D cameras.
6561213	6564054	I'm sure people have taken 3D pornographic videos.
6564114	6568457	You know that, look, here's, look, let me just break it down.
6568757	6569758	I'm just going to break it down.
6570738	6573720	Every 3DS has a 3D camera in it.
6574941	6580244	Pictures of boobs and penises were taken within seconds of the 3DS launch.
6580844	6582565	So those pictures are out there somewhere.
6582665	6585627	It's just a matter of having a place to share those pictures.
6586994	6587635	Next email from Chiggers
6612970	6617034	Has anyone tried the demo for the indie game No Luca No on Xbox?
6617574	6620677	The whole demo is you sweating Luca the cat away from your cereal.
6621858	6624760	I don't know if the whole game is like that, but I giggled like a schoolgirl.
6624800	6625261	Tee hee.
6626001	6627963	Give DarkSakura tacos because she deserves it.
6628103	6628403	P.S.
6628463	6630125	I haven't seen you guys on Drenden in a while.
6630205	6630966	We're ArtVal.
6631146	6631727	I miss you.
6632468	6636372	I'm only able to check in like once a week because I'm really busy with raiding now all of a sudden.
6636432	6637313	We are actually doing that.
6637613	6640156	But I will check in on the Drenden Guild very soon.
6640176	6641277	I do at least once a week.
6641437	6641938	I have an idea.
6642158	6642338	What?
6642719	6644200	Tuesday, let's have a Drenden-a-thon.
6644801	6647124	I got to check the personal calendar, but maybe.
6648265	6648545	Maybe.
6648725	6649466	Drenden-a-thon.
6649526	6650147	Drenden-a-thon.
6650868	6658901	Otherwise, as far as the whole Luca the Cat or whatever that game was called, no, I've never played that game, but I'm going to as soon as I... Oh, I fucking can't.
6658961	6661265	I will in 21 days when the investigation is complete.
6661786	6662647	Thanks, Microsoft.
6663502	6666783	I'm actually looking up NoLucaNo, and there's a video on here.
6666823	6669564	It says worst Xbox Live game ever on YouTube.
6671084	6674185	Okay, I'm going to have to just send you the link to this, Rob, so that you can pull it up.
6674546	6676766	By the way, BlackWolf is on it right now.
6676846	6682488	He makes websites, so I'm assuming that BlackWolf is currently in the process of making 3DS boobs right now.
6682568	6684769	So we'll just wait on that.
6688979	6689720	Hi Rob, Jamie, and Loki.
6689740	6692702	I just wanted to say keep up the amazing work and dedication to your fans.
6692742	6695784	And by the way, Jamie, I wanted to inform you about a website.
6695864	6699828	Please use... The website is Abandonia.com A-B-A-N-D-O-N-I-A.com
6715780	6722766	The website hosts abandonware and such, although I would verify its legality because I honestly didn't pay much attention to it.
6722846	6723246	LOL.
6723807	6729732	I was looking for a copy of SimTower for my PC and found it on this floating site, so.
6730432	6736177	Also, I know it's technically ultra lame to plug a podcast that is unrelated to said current podcast on said podcast.
6736357	6736697	LOL.
6737258	6739139	But I would appreciate it if you would plug my podcast.
6739219	6739620	BEEP!
6740060	6742021	Beep!
6743042	6743282	Sorry.
6743863	6744963	Square Tech Podcast.
6744983	6746585	The first episode hasn't been posted yet.
6746925	6747645	Beep!
6748046	6752249	But you can view the site associated with my show at Beep!
6752509	6754770	Where we talk about Beep!
6755331	6756291	Beep!
6756652	6758173	Thank you, you guys rock my socks.
6759834	6761275	Okay, it's squarepowered.com.
6763417	6764197	You're so kind.
6764497	6765238	Beep!
6766383	6767183	Last email.
6768164	6769184	Revised.
6769425	6772686	Some tips on reducing the pain and cost of an account hack.
6773627	6774907	Oh, this is from Alan.
6776248	6777288	I'm going to read the whole thing.
6778329	6778769	OLR.
6779469	6787593	So after what happened to Rob this weekend, I thought it might be nice to try and put together PSA on account fraud since I had to deal with so much of it at the porn place.
6788554	6791275	Keep in mind... Sorry, I'm watching a video of NoLucaNo.
6791315	6791936	It's adorable.
6793283	6796628	I can't play it because it's got douchebags talking over it.
6797790	6802378	All you do, all it is, you just push the stick to shoo the cat away.
6802438	6803019	That's all it is.
6806660	6808141	That's not your cereal, it's my cereal.
6808161	6809161	That's so dopey, I love it.
6809221	6810202	Alright, serious topics.
6810342	6811282	Xbox Live Hacking, yes.
6827350	6836534	If you're comfortable confirming that the fraud is isolated to one account because the card used was on file and not actually revealed to anyone, try to have the firm handle it first.
6836914	6844798	Some places refuse to do repeat business with a customer who has filed a chargeback against them without contacting them, which might matter if you want to keep a relationship with them.
6845638	6852402	Many will panic and immediately have their bank kill and reissue everything, potentially overkill and an added nightmare of work if it is not truly needed.
6853422	6854823	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6875323	6877404	3.
6875843	6877404	Sadly not everyone can do this one.
6877484	6880345	Keep recurring digital services all on the same credit card.
6880725	6886907	And most importantly, a card that has its balance against credit, not a debit card that has its balance against cash.
6887548	6897051	If you decide that a firm sucks ass and you're over it, it's much easier for a bank to issue chargebacks against stolen credit versus real electronically transferred cash.
6897611	6901673	So banks have little to no buyer protection when it comes to online fraud made against money.
6902453	6922342	also be prepared to wait you can always escalate to a manager but generally telling people you need this money within 24 hours to pay rent or even if it is true will not accomplish much after making the rep feel like crap other than making the rep feel like crap that Rob has to wait 21 days after doing all of his due diligence to get a refund is not uncommon I can vouch for that too
6923291	6923351	Hey!
6923371	6923991	Don't give away my money.
6952825	6959510	Those are all some good tips and I know he kind of used to work in a sales type of environment and probably had to deal right with all that stuff on the front line.
6961491	6970717	Since I worked for a mortgage company too, I can tell you that it is incredibly easy for anyone who has a little bit of your personal information to call in and impersonate you.
6971558	6973439	I'm going to tell you what I used to do.
6974780	6982122	Every so often involved in mortgage situations when we would have people call in for payoffs on their mortgage.
6983303	6985584	You see, is there a prepayment penalty, something like that.
6985964	6996027	We would have the new loan officers call in and impersonate the customers because they had all of their personal information right there.
6996907	7012941	and if I at any point ever suspected it then I would put them on hold call the customer and say I think someone's impersonating you I'm going to three-way you usually screwed you know a person out of a mortgage but we would have spouses call we'd have exes call in
7014042	7016406	and because they were privy to all that information.
7017507	7027602	Another thing that will help is that with any of your facilities that you can work with on a phone, if they have a password set up verbally, set it up.
7029356	7056706	I really don't like to talk about my day job on the show because I try to keep my work life and my night life separate but I will say that for many years I worked in a health insurance call center environment and I will tell you there's many strict laws about what type of information can be given because you're talking about people's health information there's strict federal laws about what can and can't be said in a conversation and honestly part of me is kind of like I think
7058066	7061929	We need strict laws like that for everything, no matter what the industry is.
7063730	7068773	A lot of companies take good care, but clearly my information is at risk in some places.
7068793	7070874	I was such a snot as a customer service rep.
7071995	7076037	Keep in mind, I also took escalated calls because I got promoted to a training rep.
7078899	7081561	I would actually start quoting the Federal Privacy Act.
7082741	7088643	I had it saved as a PDF with parts highlighted and say, well, you can tell me that.
7088683	7094144	I'm like, actually, according to the Federal Privacy Act, and would read them line for line, like, I want to talk to your manager.
7094344	7096145	Well, my manager can't break the law either.
7097425	7098405	And then just hang up.
7100526	7100846	All right.
7101306	7102266	Anyhow, all good tips.
7102486	7103066	All good tips.
7103266	7105507	Things I probably should have listened to before this happened.
7105547	7107988	I also want to say that the Federal Privacy Act came out in 1979, so look it up.
7111107	7111408	By the way, 1974.
7124770	7125350	No, Luca.
7129852	7130052	No.
7131673	7133414	Every time it's no, and I guess you get points.
7134014	7134935	Every time you shoo him away.
7135375	7137416	Now, does the game get harder as you go through?
7137736	7138176	Let me see.
7138876	7140757	Fine, just eat my breakfast.
7141638	7142898	Fine, just eat my breakfast.
7142998	7145199	And the cat meowed and ate breakfast.
7145479	7148201	For the record, by the way, the Federal Privacy Act of 1974.
7149361	7150782	Oh, got pwned.
7151562	7152362	No, no one told me.
7152442	7152963	I just looked it up.
7153403	7153643	All right.
7154133	7156154	I want to know what this big flashing elephant is.
7157514	7157894	In what?
7158194	7159475	Oh, VVVV?
7160055	7161035	It's an elephant with a tear.
7161975	7162936	Maybe you made it cry.
7164176	7168177	Alright, speaking of making people cry, once in a while we like to rant on this program.
7168217	7170838	It's called the FUs of the Week, and we're going to do that right now.
7187214	7187675	F.U.
7188936	7194122	to the unemployment office here in California for switching people over to debit cards.
7195043	7196805	And the only reason I'm saying F.U.
7196825	7198166	about this, actually, my F.U.
7198206	7199247	is really the Bank of America.
7200008	7206395	Because California Unemployment decided to go through Bank of America to issue debit cards, which, that's fine.
7206555	7208557	I have no problem with a debit card.
7209838	7238848	and so far it was actually fairly easy to set it up to do a direct deposit when my money comes in into my checking account so that's fine I just have to do my fill out my stupid form but I set it up for my first deposit to do that it's like no we're gonna set it up for every deposit afterwards it doesn't work on your first one so that means I have to go to the bank and have them do a manual transfer so Bank of America can suck my non-existent call Loki do you have any FUs of the week
7240721	7247746	Um... I don't know if you get a KFC for only having 7 out of the 10 hot wings I won.
7249107	7250688	Did you get shorted 3 hot wings?
7250828	7254071	Well, they said that, well, for some reason we only have 7.
7254291	7256093	We'll give you chicken tenders instead.
7256113	7256913	I'm like, eh, fine.
7257894	7258314	That's funny.
7258574	7259715	I don't know.
7259735	7263318	Alright, um... These are serious first world problems, Loki.
7263678	7264979	Serious first world problems.
7266152	7271399	Man, they substituted three of my hot wings for chicken tenders.
7271480	7275004	My FU of the week goes to the fucker that stole 125 bucks from me.
7275125	7276546	Fuck you, you fucking fuck.
7278509	7279370	I feel a little better.
7279571	7281153	Yeah, burn his house down.
7282294	7283336	No, don't burn my house down.
7284079	7285781	No, I meant the fucker.
7286721	7291005	It's probably... It's got to be some mass operation overseas somewhere that's doing it.
7291146	7302916	I bet anything it's some other country where they've got a shop of people that are hacking all these Xbox Live accounts somehow that probably... The information was probably breached and Microsoft just doesn't know it yet.
7303317	7305579	Probably got stolen the same time as Sony's, but whatever.
7305599	7306720	I don't want to make stuff up, but...
7307080	7309083	All I know is that I have money stolen and I'm pissed.
7310245	7313310	But at least the lady that worked at Xbox.com was nice.
7313911	7316856	She was nice enough to tell me that, hey, she's had money stolen from her, too.
7317036	7317236	So...
7318499	7318979	and DarkSakura.
7345484	7346465	This is ridiculous.
7347165	7350367	Microsoft keeps doing this and yet we all get mad at Sony.
7352649	7352909	Rob.
7353029	7353249	What?
7353369	7354170	It's just irritating.
7354430	7354690	Heart.
7355630	7356391	I'm not mad at you.
7356431	7360053	I'm just mad at... I'm partially mad at myself for letting it happen.
7360073	7361434	I'm just kind of mad at Microsoft.
7361494	7363055	It's just ridiculous.
7364876	7365136	Rawr.
7366257	7366737	Rawr.
7367318	7367518	What?
7368038	7368559	Poor Rob.
7368599	7369519	Can we move on to more news?
7369739	7370020	Loki.
7372481	7372881	Alright.
7373622	7373662	Um...
7375140	7376481	So this is kind of cool.
7376561	7383207	They're apparently going to be doing some new... I'm assuming it's just a port of Counter-Strike.
7383928	7386210	Valve is putting out Counter-Strike Global Offensive.
7386791	7391795	It's coming to Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network, and Steam early next year.
7392636	7395438	And of course it's going to have new maps, characters, and weapons.
7396379	7398961	And some renovated classic maps as well.
7399982	7406687	and new modes, matchmaking options, leaderboards, all the usual stuff that they have in shooters nowadays.
7411050	7413592	That's kind of cool that they're actually putting out a new game.
7413692	7419316	Everyone loves Valve games and I'm sure this one will be supported just as well as all the other stuff that they put out.
7419776	7421377	And maybe they'll have hats someday.
7421397	7424480	Yay hats.
7424520	7424800	Hats.
7427424	7440951	Some other cool stuff, of course, they're going to have a new decoy grenade, which is kind of cool, and some other new animations and models and whatnot.
7441171	7447715	There's going to be a new heavy machine gun, a new range of shotguns, specifically for close-up combat.
7448115	7457423	Molotov, uh, cocktail grenades, and, um, I guess, uh, some stuff for cutting off certain areas of the map.
7457943	7466290	And then, uh, basically a decoy grenade, which it'll do is it'll send out a burst of gunfire from wherever it's thrown.
7466390	7471935	So if you want to make someone think that you're in one place that you're not, then you can do that.
7472475	7473096	And then, um,
7475495	7478957	I guess they also have some other stuff that they're tweaking.
7480198	7482720	Gunfire for different weapons and stuff like that.
7483000	7494488	Also, they're going to have, I guess, different things where they're going to give everybody Kevlar, the round starter, making people have to defuse bombs and stuff like that.
7494888	7498330	So it sounds like they're trying to tweak up the gameplay and stuff like that.
7498350	7499751	I don't know.
7499912	7500492	It sounds good to me.
7503601	7505322	Are you excited for a new Counter-Strike game?
7505362	7508683	You know, I own the old one on Xbox, even though I am terrible at it.
7508943	7522549	I think I maybe played online once, and I was so terrible, I got screamed at, and I just... You know, I've never really played the original, but I know it's definitely popular, so, I mean... I don't know, this should do well.
7523049	7527731	I mean, it's one of the first major military first-person shooter games that they had out there, so...
7530566	7531206	I think it'll do well.
7531526	7534087	So can I read a text message I just got from Extifer?
7534347	7534608	Do it.
7534648	7535748	My co-host over on Horde House.
7536048	7538569	No, this is hilarious.
7538609	7539009	Here you go.
7539950	7549273	Hey, I just thought you should know that, insert person's name redacted here, Xbox account and money got hacked a few weeks ago, just in case you're talking about it on the show tonight.
7549633	7551594	Nope, that's person number five I know that's been hacked.
7552174	7552934	I thought that was six.
7554195	7556816	Whatever, it's a fucking lot of people that this is happening to, and...
7558598	7561882	Nothing's going on Microsoft, but Sony needs to provide free debix.
7562443	7563744	I'm going to have Dan check ours now.
7564405	7565066	Seriously.
7565427	7567109	I'm telling you guys, change your fucking passwords.
7567149	7567730	Like, do it.
7569959	7570720	Anyhow, moving on.
7572100	7572601	Other news.
7572981	7575422	This is about Kingdom Hearts.
7576663	7578143	No, it's not news about Kingdom Hearts 3.
7578584	7578884	Sorry.
7579144	7583026	But there is, of course, Kingdom Hearts 3D or Dream Drop Distance.
7583306	7583586	Get it?
7584326	7586207	That is coming out, I guess, soon.
7586547	7589929	You're going to be getting a hands-on if you're going to the Tokyo Game Show in the fall.
7590889	7598073	However, what's also interesting in the Kingdom Hearts universe is in the latest issue of the Japanese magazine Dengeki PlayStation,
7599073	7620401	Tetsuya Nomura actually said that it's becoming difficult to get new players into the series with each new iteration well the plot's kind of complicated I'm not too surprised at that but what's also interesting about it as a celebration of the franchise's 10th anniversary he hopes to release an HD technical test of the series what?
7621241	7624944	Does that mean like a tech demo like Final Fantasy 7?
7625845	7627847	Does it mean remakes of the first game?
7628007	7630189	Because you're talking about trying to get people into it?
7630669	7631510	That would be awesome.
7632410	7632871	Who knows?
7633231	7636494	But perhaps there's more information at Tokyo Game Show next month.
7636994	7638214	Oh, don't tease me like that.
7638675	7641736	That's terrible that they're teasing us so terribly with that.
7643336	7644097	We'll see what happens.
7644677	7648078	I don't know, DarkSakura, do you think Kingdom Hearts is a tough series for people to get into?
7648558	7649158	I don't think so.
7649999	7655881	Yeah, I don't think it's like... I mean, it is a weird plot, but it did always kind of fascinate me.
7655921	7658902	Kingdom Hearts was sort of for kids, but not really.
7659602	7661062	Probably older kids, definitely.
7661363	7664464	But a young kid would never understand that plot.
7664504	7665104	I'm sorry, it's...
7665734	7668455	Why is Mickey wearing black and has a sword?
7668475	7669475	It's really convoluted.
7669735	7679557	But I think that's why people really love Kingdom Hearts is that it is a little bit the darker side of Disney, which, you know, Epic Mickey sort of tried to do, but eh.
7679997	7680257	Yeah.
7680557	7680777	So.
7681957	7683518	And Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.
7683698	7683898	What?
7684458	7687479	You made a grammatical error.
7687739	7688259	I'm sorry.
7688299	7688839	What did I do now?
7690120	7700505	You use an apostrophe for it Oh my gosh It's a radio show, nobody sees that I do Well, how about I just use that to go ahead and get into my news then?
7701326	7706829	Sure Okay Australia is getting an R18 plus rating Finally!
7707809	7715173	Get with it, Australia They actually have it added to their new rating system so that they can have mature games
7718479	7719140	It's about time.
7719400	7722002	Instead of just banning them outright, you know.
7723283	7726225	So maybe Mortal Kombat will finally come out in Australia legitimately.
7726485	7726826	Maybe.
7727026	7728787	And some of the other games that have been banned there recently.
7728907	7737174	But, I mean, if you look at it from a financial point of view, putting the ratings out there and allowing these games to come out instead of banning them is revenue.
7737734	7738515	That's going to be awesome.
7738535	7742738	There's going to be an explosion of violent and graphic games in Australia really soon.
7743234	7747216	Yeah, and kangaroos will run all over you and punch you in the face.
7747236	7750138	They'll have a bunch of unrated editions come out.
7750318	7752639	You know, it wasn't in the show role, but did you hear about the fuckery?
7752859	7757902	I mean, I'm sure you heard about the fuckery that was going on in Britain this week with all the rioting and all that stuff.
7757922	7758742	It's so awful.
7758983	7763625	It's terrible, but the real fuckery I'm talking about is how people wanted to blame all that on Grand Theft Auto.
7764085	7766106	Because, of course, you gotta blame it on something.
7766146	7768068	You can't just blame it on fuckers being fuckers.
7768628	7768848	Yeah.
7769560	7770180	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7782836	7788678	Well, on top of that... I mean, there's trashy people everywhere, but I just, you know, you didn't think it would happen there in jolly old England.
7788838	7793359	Did you see the thing I put on my Tumblr about the old man's barbershop?
7793940	7794060	No.
7794500	7800742	There was an elderly gentleman whose shop got ransacked, and he had owned it with his wife, and his wife passed away.
7801622	7804203	And they, like, completely tore up his barbershop.
7804243	7806884	He'd had it for something like, I want to say, 40 years.
7807084	7807464	How sad.
7808044	7814406	and that he'd have to go out of business, but there's actually an online group going around raising money to rebuild his store.
7815686	7816986	If I can find it, I'll link it in the chat room.
7817546	7818847	But I thought that was a nice touch.
7820847	7827109	RDGSinge in the chat is throwing back to something last week, but wants to ask DarkSakura a question, and I guess now's a good time.
7827509	7828749	Any updates on the tester?
7829369	7830069	Remember last week?
7830469	7832310	Yeah, I've been upgraded to contestant.
7832330	7833010	Really?
7833030	7833330	Really.
7834355	7836316	Yeah, that means I have to do a stupid video.
7837016	7841578	But now I kind of, I mean, there's part of me that doesn't want to because I don't want to be away from Dan.
7842879	7843039	Aww.
7843379	7846681	Because when he was gone for five days and it made me sad.
7846821	7848061	It's only going to be a few days.
7848201	7851643	And I don't think it's like Survivor where you can't call people.
7851843	7854064	I think they let you talk to your family and stuff.
7854828	7858252	I'm sure they do, but I mean, I don't like L.A.
7858352	7858613	either.
7859453	7862697	I'd just be like, we're done taping, bye, I'm going to Disneyland.
7863918	7865340	I'd just hang out with Marissa all the time.
7865920	7867142	You'd be with other nerds.
7867482	7870746	I mean, of course, they're purposely going to cast people, they're going to drive you bonkers.
7871326	7874930	But, you know, if you don't kill them, you might get a job and a couple thousand dollars.
7875811	7876151	Maybe.
7877491	7879972	But yeah, I got my account upgrade a few days ago.
7880352	7881152	Woohoo, I guess.
7881692	7884713	So now you are an official contestant of Tester Season 3.
7884753	7885013	Yay.
7885033	7886613	This bothers me.
7886633	7888114	I don't know why I'm so bothered by this.
7889474	7889754	All right.
7890234	7892895	Anyhow, Loki, we got a couple more news stories for you guys.
7892915	7894055	Then we're going to open up the Skype line.
7894655	7896236	Folks, I need to put this out here.
7896336	7898236	The 800 number is not working tonight.
7899156	7902577	So you can only Skype us tonight at Orange Lounge Radio.
7902617	7903697	The problem is temporary.
7904097	7905538	It'll hopefully be fixed by next week.
7905578	7909419	But just a heads up, you can only Skype us tonight at Orange Lounge Radio.
7909479	7912600	So the 877 number again, not working tonight.
7912660	7913380	Please don't use it.
7913880	7915080	Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.
7915240	7916941	But first, a couple more stories for you guys.
7917961	7924726	Now normally you don't hear of some wild successes on Xbox Live Indie games, but there is one.
7925186	7929008	And this should come as no surprise, seeing as it's kind of a clone of another game.
7929709	7936953	FortressCraft, the kind of Minecraft knockoff, has sold 350,000 copies and brought in over a million dollars.
7942798	7951787	And, uh, they said, of course, no, it's not really like Minecraft, it's more of like Dwarf Fortress, but it's Minecraft, okay?
7952147	7953729	I mean, it looks like goddamn Minecraft.
7954209	7962117	So, um, it is the, probably the best-selling, I would imagine the best-selling game on Xbox Live Indie Games, it's making a million dollars.
7963835	7964756	Yeah, that's pretty good.
7966819	7971684	Apparently there is an 84% trial to purchase conversion rate, which is pretty impressive if you ask me.
7972685	7973847	400,823 copies sold.
7982064	7983565	They have a bunch of different statistics.
7983625	7987566	It's funny in there.
7987746	7992268	96,197,520 Microsoft points spent on the game.
7993489	7996730	Most of the purchases being in the US, followed by Great Britain and Canada.
8000712	8004654	I guess that's good news for Minecraft when it comes out over here.
8004674	8005734	It looks like people want it.
8007975	8008735	All right.
8009596	8010096	Good thing.
8011757	8012057	All right.
8012557	8017699	Anyhow, one more story for you guys, then we're going to open up the Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.
8018600	8023642	And this has to do with the game Rage that's going to be coming out fairly soon.
8023682	8027324	Of course, this is a new FPS franchise that's coming out.
8028164	8037388	Tim Wiltis, who is the ID Software Creative Director, of course, ID Software is putting out this game, he says that the access to the game's underground...
8037628	8041351	will be restricted to those who get their copy new at retail.
8041632	8042753	Excuse me, new at retail.
8044054	8046496	He's saying, you've played Rage five times.
8046797	8048678	Have you ever found any sewer hatches?
8049219	8051901	If you bought the game new, that would be open for you.
8052562	8055444	So he says, you still have to download it, but you don't have to pay for it.
8055585	8056766	Those hatches are all over.
8057146	8061570	Most people never find them, but as soon as you do, you're like, oh, and then you start to look for it.
8061650	8063412	That's our first time buyer incentive.
8063792	8090389	so instead of doing an online pass or whatever a lot of companies are doing I guess there's these new little zone for lack of a better word that you can explore but only if you are a new game owner otherwise you may never notice it's there I guess because it's all in the sewer and what I understand none of the main storyline happens in the sewer I guess this is all like side quests so it's basically additional content that's only available when you buy it new
8091741	8099045	No, no, it's not additional content because if it's already on the disc and you're just unlocking access to it, then it's not additional.
8099185	8102226	Now, if it's some download content, then that's a little different.
8102827	8105928	But I have a feeling this is crap that's already on the disc.
8105988	8109510	They're just allowing you access to it, which is kind of lame.
8112955	8114859	Alright, well we're going to go ahead and open up the Skype line.
8114919	8117023	We are Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.
8117043	8119187	You can go ahead and give us a call on Skype.
8119328	8123155	In the meantime, we're going to check the Twitter and go to some Twitter topics.
8125979	8131123	I'm going to the Twitter right now, twitter.com of course slash OLR if you want to send us some tweets.
8131763	8137687	Meanwhile, let's go on to some tweets.
8137867	8151717	Starting off with Flocko Jones, who I guess must be listening live tonight because he's tweeting us and saying, LulzSec announced in mid-June that they released Xbox Live account information and Microsoft did nothing.
8151966	8152947	Xbox Live, Facebook, etc.
8182156	8182516	Interesting.
8182536	8197321	Yeah, and it does say that the story is appended with an update that says Microsoft released a statement that Xbox Live was not compromised to the best of Microsoft's knowledge and the login's passwords were released at random with people encouraged to try the information on services like Xbox Live.
8197661	8199022	And I do remember that happening.
8199062	8202543	I do remember when they released like a big list of login and passwords and all that stuff, so...
8205524	8214729	Also, Flaco Jones in the tweet says to us, maybe if Microsoft took Xbox Live down for a month when they most likely knew account info had been compromised, no money would have been stolen.
8215669	8216990	Kind of like I guess Sony did.
8217950	8219511	Interesting.
8219551	8226375	Going to another tweet here from Nico Nico Chan tweets us saying, I heard from a friend that DarkSakura likes Parapara.
8227095	8230717	I was wondering what Parapara dancers she watched on YouTube, if she does.
8232117	8233098	I just watch whatever I find.
8233658	8234758	You're just kind of a YouTuber.
8234798	8236298	It's more the songs for you, isn't it?
8236899	8237459	Well, yeah.
8237499	8238999	I mean, there's certain dances that I like.
8239039	8241380	I like the one for Velfar.
8241920	8242981	There's a number of them that I like.
8243361	8248382	But I'll find different groups and see different people doing them.
8248782	8251983	For those that don't know what Parapara is, how can you best describe it to people?
8252163	8253284	Cheerleading and line dancing.
8254184	8255664	Cheerleading and line dancing combined.
8256905	8258145	How would you classify the music?
8260066	8260426	Synth-y.
8261331	8266053	Let me play you an example of a song from Para Para Paradise, just in case you've never heard.
8266354	8268615	So imagine doing like... Play Valpar if you have it.
8269095	8270235	I didn't have that one ready, sorry.
8270676	8271936	This is like cheer dancing.
8271976	8272317	Here you go.
8278860	8281501	Jamie is actually waving her hands here in the studio.
8281861	8283062	This is one that I used to know.
8290449	8291050	DarkSakura.com
8315729	8317050	Oh, Rob, that's not possible.
8317590	8317990	Shut up.
8319291	8319631	Heart.
8320151	8323212	I'm trying to find Like a Virgin because it has the funniest intro ever.
8323272	8324133	Hold on, I've got to find it.
8326634	8328695	Do you miss the Parapara machine that was here locally?
8328855	8329115	Yes, I do.
8329135	8330135	I know you said something about that.
8330956	8334017	And someone's supposed to lend me Dance Masters so I can do Night of Fire.
8334637	8335558	You know Night of Fire.
8336598	8338099	I do now thanks to Dance Masters.
8339219	8340260	So, where is it?
8340320	8340580	I can't.
8343736	8345797	Hold on, I got one other directory I gotta check.
8345997	8350217	This is awesome live radio, but hold on, I gotta check one more folder here.
8352118	8353398	Hurry up, we got Pinkberry.
8354358	8360339	I used to have the entirety of DDR Freak's radios rotation here on the computer.
8361499	8363540	And I'm pretty sure they had it in their rotation.
8366140	8366440	Here it is.
8367080	8367280	Okay.
8367940	8368820	Hilarious opening.
8369220	8372061	And the band, of course, is called Virgin L. So here you go.
8388600	8396563	Zether in chat says, when I dance to Eurobeat, I pretend to drive a car really fast down a mountain pass, shifting the gears of my hands and the steering wheel movements.
8396803	8398984	This is not Initial D. I'm sorry.
8399244	8407967	It is Initial D. Initial D. Most of these performers, by the way, the bands are out of Italy.
8409940	8411041	Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.
8411061	8412482	Again, Skype line is open, guys.
8413843	8416485	Going to Tigerclaw sends us a couple tweets here.
8416605	8422250	One of them has to do with Nintendo looking at trademark applications for Wii U in the U.S.
8422310	8428595	Now, this is not just, I think, what DarkSakura was talking about earlier, but some other related things, such as...
8429275	8458859	point cards, advertising and publicity services for providing information let's see, telecommunication via electronic bulletin boards providing images via communication with handheld game devices clothing for domestic pets bags and the like and so forth oh god, you know what game that is clothing, waistbands, belts for clothing card games notebooks consumer video game machines fitted with a camera function meaning I guess the camera's already built in
8459266	8471067	Hmm Interesting IDK Alright, also TigerClaw tweets us another tweet Sony wants to know what Playstation Vita peripherals you want What do you want to see on the Vita?
8472927	8492937	So I guess some of the responses that are showing up on this poll so far It's on the Japanese PlayStation Vita community site A UMD drive A cradle with HDMI out A compact full keyboard A grip adapter with a secondary battery built in UMD drive is by far the most popular response so far How about a USB connector?
8494316	8497098	That might be already there, I think.
8498259	8500261	Yeah, Loki's confirming that it's already there.
8501782	8504104	Again, Orange Laundry on Skype if you want to give us a call tonight.
8504124	8509388	You should have one of those paypoint things where you put your card up to the sensor and it charges you.
8510366	8511427	Here, I don't have to enter anything.
8511447	8512267	I'll just buy all of this.
8512567	8516149	DarkTetsuya says, we should totally start bees for Xenoblade.
8516189	8516929	It's a hashtag.
8516970	8517510	Just saying.
8518650	8519471	If you want.
8519511	8521392	Maybe it'll catch on like President Cat.
8521452	8522052	You can do it.
8523693	8524093	I don't know.
8524413	8524853	Go for it.
8524894	8526895	If you think it should be done, you should start that.
8528315	8530096	I will endorse bees for Xenoblade.
8530136	8530576	There you go.
8531177	8531457	All right.
8531697	8532597	We got a call coming in.
8532617	8534358	Let's go to the phones and take the call.
8534598	8535499	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
8535519	8535859	Who's this?
8537180	8537460	Hello?
8537860	8538961	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
8538981	8539281	Who's this?
8540305	8541306	TheWordNate again.
8541686	8542467	Hey, what's up, Nate?
8543588	8548633	Yeah, dude, I was calling about the indie thing, the indie gaming.
8549133	8549353	Yes.
8550494	8551635	I'm an indie game developer.
8551956	8553937	You are an indie game developer yourself.
8554918	8555219	Yeah.
8555399	8556600	What games are you developing?
8558019	8559380	Don't laugh at me now.
8559921	8562683	I'm making a farming game right now.
8563503	8564044	Oh, God.
8564084	8565285	A farming game?
8566065	8566626	But hold on.
8566726	8568547	It's not like Farmville.
8569007	8571789	It's more like Monopoly mixed with Harvest Moon.
8572710	8572870	Okay.
8572890	8574031	Now, people like Harvest Moon.
8574411	8574932	So, okay.
8574972	8575652	And Monopoly.
8575732	8576733	Monopoly is a fun game.
8577093	8585039	I read the most weird news story ever this week that was talking about how in Monopoly, you actually don't want to own Boardwalk.
8585079	8586700	You want to own Illinois Avenue.
8587461	8591322	Yeah, I saw the article too, but I didn't read it.
8591362	8594283	I just saw it and said, these people don't know what they're talking about.
8596583	8598044	So the game's not out yet then.
8598064	8599584	You don't have anything to plug just yet.
8600464	8606086	I don't know if you want to give away all the secrets, but how do you combine the worlds of Monopoly and Harvest Moon?
8607543	8620676	well in the game you really um okay you're trying to start a farming monopoly so um you start off as a small farmer and then later down the road you just you just uh you just get opportunities to take over other people's farms and um
8621591	8622472	Get new property.
8622852	8624532	You get to get the government to help you out.
8625013	8628594	And it's a lot of crazy, like... We get to take over people's farms with guns?
8629975	8631395	No, you get to put them out of business.
8631755	8633896	You're producing government-supported crops.
8635477	8637538	You're encouraging people to grow government cheese.
8639633	8640654	Well, it's good, isn't it?
8641134	8649418	Well, yeah, but you know your game's probably going to get, like, targeted by the organic growers of America or something.
8650858	8653680	And, you know, especially the Slow Food International.
8654560	8655360	And the Tea Party.
8656201	8657761	No, the Tea Party's all down for that.
8658261	8659622	They don't care about organic food.
8659642	8664004	I'm going to say that crops are organic in the game, even though they aren't.
8665840	8669516	if you have organic ones then you need to have them cost more
8671127	8675828	Yeah, it didn't get bad quicker than it tastes worse.
8676469	8677929	But whatever.
8678069	8679690	All right, well, let me ask you this.
8679790	8682471	Where did you get the idea to develop a game like this?
8682491	8683311	Like, what inspired you?
8683331	8687472	Because, you know, people got to remember, you don't write an indie game in one night.
8687692	8691913	I mean, I guess you can, but that's, you know, most of them definitely are not done in one night.
8692053	8693954	They take a long time to develop.
8694234	8695975	So you really have to be committed to your idea.
8696055	8698616	So where did you get the idea that I want to do a...
8700296	8702779	Farming game that's not Farmville.
8702839	8705062	We'll say, I want to do a farming game that's cool.
8705683	8706824	Where did you kind of get that idea?
8708166	8716236	Well, it was just random thoughts during the day, and I kind of got down to it because it started off with just three people farming on a farm.
8716932	8724942	and then I thought they should make money and they should have enemies and they should kill wolves and stuff too.
8725362	8732250	So I was thinking about keep a spend on the enemy concept and they should have a huge mission to be the best farmers in the world.
8732390	8734473	Oh cool, so your game does have violence in it.
8735859	8736259	Of course.
8736359	8737140	I'm on board.
8737220	8739021	You get to hit wolves, not people.
8739081	8740521	You don't steal people's farms.
8740541	8742562	You just make them sell out to you.
8743023	8743603	Awesome.
8745004	8747685	By selling your crops for less money than them on purpose.
8747765	8749266	You know, like the Walmart model.
8749446	8750746	So what are you developing for?
8750766	8753088	Are you developing for Facebook or iOS or what?
8754248	8755929	No, it's going to be for the big three.
8757595	8758716	That's not LeBron James.
8758756	8762339	It's going to be for Mac, Windows, and Linux.
8762960	8767103	Ah, okay, so you're going for not the big three consoles, but the big three computers.
8767183	8768785	All right, I'm down Mac, PC, Linux.
8769766	8772008	Maybe you will be in the next Humble Indie Bundle.
8773989	8778753	I hope so, but I need to keep developing, especially the graphics, because...
8780242	8782023	I don't have much backgrounds.
8782043	8784385	I just have like skies and trees in the background.
8784605	8784865	All right.
8785366	8787507	Where's a website we can keep tabs on your progress?
8787527	8791190	Do you have like a blog or something or at least a Twitter where we can keep tabs on your progress?
8792150	8794752	I want to type it on the chat so you can like see it.
8794932	8795152	All right.
8795212	8795593	That works.
8795873	8797374	It's Tailware.com.
8797734	8797994	Okay.
8798735	8799395	Tailware.com.
8799415	8800256	I'll look for that in the chat room.
8801533	8807097	Yeah, so on the side, it's utter crap on there.
8807317	8809919	But it'll get better as the game gets further along.
8810840	8817344	It's a really bad demo up already, but that's like a really, really old and bad demo up.
8818245	8819085	It feels so fresh.
8819185	8819826	I'll give you the link.
8820533	8820973	All right.
8821433	8826235	Well, when you get your game finished and you're ready to get it out there, you've got to come back on the show and tell us more about it.
8826315	8833297	I won't you give away all your ideas yet because you're still developing it, but you've got to come back on the show, maybe with one of your co-developers, and talk a little more about it.
8834837	8835978	Yeah, most definitely, you know.
8837671	8838292	Smurf it up.
8838612	8840633	Alright.
8840693	8841914	La la la la la la.
8842014	8842354	Alright.
8843055	8844976	I'm going to let you go so we can get more calls.
8844996	8845557	Thanks for the call.
8846757	8849479	Take care, buddy.
8849679	8851341	Orange Lounge Radio on Skype if you want to call us.
8851401	8853622	Again, tonight the 800 number does not work.
8854163	8855403	No, we didn't forget to pay the bill.
8856304	8859766	There's some other issues going on so we will be back with that next week.
8859967	8861588	Orange Lounge Radio on Skype if you want to give us a call.
8863189	8866011	Moving on to more tweets.
8867095	8870284	Osfer tweeted us saying, Hi guys, guess who's in Disney World?
8871367	8871969	You suck.
8871989	8872570	Your mom.
8872731	8873333	You suck.
8874841	8881005	S2100 Matt tweets us saying July 2011 was apparently the worst month for the video game industry in almost five years.
8881526	8886549	Yeah, I read this story too and it has a lot of people going, oh shit, the video game industry is in trouble.
8886609	8890051	But I'm like, well, what games came out in July 2011?
8891032	8891592	Catherine.
8891973	8898457	When Catherine is your biggest release like all month, like I'm sorry, no disrespect to Catherine, but it's not exactly a AAA title.
8898537	8900859	Or disrespect to Earth Defense Force Inside Armageddon.
8901659	8902100	Excuse me, Loki?
8902120	8902520	Excuse me, Loki?
8933590	8936352	Like I said, it's no surprise that it was a weak month.
8936372	8938653	I demand an explanation for these shenanigans.
8938934	8943317	Plus the 3DS really doesn't have a lot going for it right now, nor does the PSP.
8943757	8946399	We're kind of in between a lot of consoles right now.
8946439	8953323	I mean, granted the 360 and PS3 are still kind of at their prime, but those systems don't have fucking anything until the holidays.
8953904	8955405	Except Catherine.
8956625	8957246	Alright, anyhow.
8958379	8962002	Moving on to MNZiba tweets us saying, I downloaded Jukebeat.
8962322	8964964	The Contra song on Extreme is hilarious.
8965384	8966986	How are you supposed to beat that?
8967346	8968667	You literally have to memorize it.
8968687	8973350	You're going to have to memorize where all those little fuckers show up and know exactly where to tap.
8973391	8975032	Have you tried a song on Expert yet, Loki?
8975072	8975692	Just out of curiosity.
8976053	8976893	I haven't even tried.
8976953	8979075	I'm sure it's pretty hilarious.
8981231	8983413	Again, our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8983893	8988896	Zether tweets us saying, Loki could learn from reason number one on this.
8989457	8993299	Five crucial lessons learned by watching kids play video games.
8993879	8996121	And I guess, Loki, you could learn from number one.
8996161	8997662	Well, let's recap.
8997682	8998823	This is a cracked article.
8999883	9002424	All they do are like top 10 lists, huh?
9002504	9005625	Like every time I get linked to some top 10 lists, it's all fucking cracked.
9005945	9010586	Like they've made a website out of top lists.
9011367	9013067	Not top lists, but top lists.
9013547	9014508	It's kind of interesting, I don't know.
9016408	9020049	Five crucial lessons learned by watching kids play video games.
9020109	9025251	Number five, they don't tolerate losing, so modern games just let them win.
9026931	9029072	They don't tolerate losing, so modern games just hand it to them.
9031176	9033859	Number four, they have no tolerance for grinding.
9034759	9036501	You know, like in an old school Final Fantasy game.
9037201	9040184	Number three, if they want to read, they'll buy a fucking book.
9042666	9045589	That might be referencing how I always like to skip to quest text in WoW.
9045669	9045989	I don't know.
9046950	9050573	Number two, they press Y to skip as fast as they can.
9051634	9053536	And number one, Loki, you could learn from this.
9054659	9055379	Don't like it?
9055939	9056380	Break it!
9078906	9086550	versus people like me that just want to play a really fun game with some weapons that necessarily weren't in the stock version of the game.
9088522	9110139	Alright, last tweet tonight from Fydelt61 on Twitter Tweets us, Final Fantasy things, fucking want And it's a tweet to a clock here And maybe I'll have to get DarkSakura to reblog this on the Tumblr So you guys can see this too It is a clock that is made up of Final Fantasy logos So like Final Fantasy 12 is at the top And then 1, 2, 3, get it?
9110560	9114823	So it's all the different Final Fantasy logos in a clock Send me that and I'll put it on our thing
9114983	9120847	All right, I will send you that link right now so you can reblog that so listeners can see it.
9120887	9124389	Again, that came to us from 5delt61 on Twitter.
9125230	9129073	And if you want to send us stuff to cross post, you can send us stuff on Twitter as well.
9130634	9134156	I guess not having the 800 number tonight just killed us on calls.
9134776	9136718	So we're going to go ahead and close up the Skype line.
9137138	9137799	That's too bad.
9137899	9144243	But then again, it has been kind of a slower week and there's not a lot of new games that people are excited to talk about and so forth.
9144611	9148375	So we're going to close on up the Skype line and cover any last minute stories.
9148395	9150698	See if Loki has any last minute stories he wants to talk about real quick.
9150758	9153441	Just one that I think is kind of funny and ironic.
9154162	9157206	Facebook has decided that they're changing their game service.
9161633	9166898	They're actually going to be updating things a little bit.
9167198	9181890	I guess they said that game growth has slowed and because of that they're starting to tweak things around so they're going to have some sort of looks like a games tab or something like that and different sorting options.
9185213	9185693	Interesting.
9186994	9187114	And
9189079	9193041	I love how they announced a lot of this the same day that Google Games came out.
9193081	9193181	Yeah.
9193761	9199504	They reopened Ferility, I guess, is what they were promising.
9200344	9207047	It basically looks like they're ripping off a bunch of ideas that Google Plus had.
9208768	9210909	But, of course, these have been in development for a long time.
9211229	9211989	Oh, yeah.
9212029	9214811	They've been in development for 6 to 12 months.
9214891	9215191	Of course.
9217552	9217892	Anything else?
9218995	9246637	that's it alright well that brings us to the close of another week here at Orange Lounge Radio we will be back next week we will be off in two weeks but we'll be here next week we've been asked about a marathon show this year on Labor Day weekend I kinda don't think that's gonna happen this year just because there's a lot going on around that time however we're gonna look at targeting another three day weekend in the future so don't be too disappointed
9246937	9251266	We want to do not just a marathon show, but we want to do a marathon that has a little more oomph this year.
9251666	9255193	So what better time to do it than kicking off the 10th year of Orange Lounge Radio.
9255554	9256957	So we'll be looking at that in the future.

9259673	9266175	Alright, so anyhow, let's go around and get everybody's final thought Loki, we'll start with you, do you have any final thought tonight?
9268335	9285480	My final thought is I'm hopefully going to be able to play some more games this week I had plans on doing that this weekend, but that kind of fell through My final thought tonight is I'm looking forward to having some Pinkberry, yay DarkSakura, your final thought tonight?
9285856	9288180	I'm going to read exactly what's on macro memory now.
9289101	9291385	50 Cent got shot and still whines about it on stage.
9291766	9295452	Teddy Roosevelt got shot mid-speech and didn't leave the stage until he was finished.
9298948	9299428	Interesting.
9299448	9302169	50 Cent got shot on stage?
9302229	9302569	I had no idea.
9302589	9303389	No, he got shot.
9303429	9304289	He just whines about it.
9304730	9307670	Well, I mean, if somebody shot me, I'd whine.
9308611	9311952	But Teddy Roosevelt got shot and finished his damn speech.
9312012	9314232	Still, if I got shot, I'd be whining about it.
9314632	9314932	All right.
9316433	9317293	But that's for another week.
9317593	9317993	Actually, no.
9318113	9319694	I should never be shot, actually, on the show.
