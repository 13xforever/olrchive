13966	25312	Tonight, October 23, 2011, the PlayStation Vita has an American launch date, Blizzard will throw in a free game if you commit to a year of Warcraft, and updates to the 3DS firmware are detailed.
31448	38454	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.

150834	160457	We will take your live calls later on in the show in Part B. Getting right into the video game chat tonight, Derek H throws down the gauntlet, so to speak, in our chatroom.
160797	166839	OLR, I would like to invite you and your listeners to participate in the big battle racing series on Forza 4.

199136	216990	I don't even have Forza I need someone to step up in our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com to participate on behalf of OLR We need somebody to do it Somebody needs to show that we are not all weak when it comes to racing games But of course, when Mario Kart 7 comes out, it's on You'd play it if it was Initial D, right?
217170	227678	You love that game Yeah, as long as it had Eurobeat in the background That would be awesome But see, Initial D, again, is an arcade racer And I love Midnight Maximum Tune in the arcades I'd be down with Ridge Racer
228919	244957	Ridge Racer Anyway, if you want more information on that you want to sign up on behalf of Orange Lounge Radio TheBigBattle.net So check that out and yeah, we need some helps representing Forza 4 because Lord knows I can't
246679	250941	Alright, before we get into our gaming week, so I wanted to talk about this a little bit.
251641	253042	Well, first, I gotta throw this out there.
253082	254903	We've been mentioning this the past couple weeks on the show.
255283	256244	I gotta reiterate this.
256824	262727	We are nominated in the 2011 Podcast Awards, www.podcastawards.com.
263867	264568	We need your votes.
265288	267609	You can vote every day between now and the 27th.
267689	268990	We mentioned this last week on the show.
269570	271051	We don't ask a lot here at Orange Launch Radio.
271091	272792	We don't play advertising on the show.
273132	277194	We don't ask for your money or premium subscriptions or sell any apps or anything like that.
277595	280596	So if you like what you hear, all we ask is that you spread the word.
280636	281697	We say that at the end of every show.
282277	309800	and winning the award would be great for promotion and not just us but the network we're on it would be terrific we won the award back in 2005 when podcasting was like first first out there and it was great promotion then but since then a lot of corporate cast have come in and really just dominated because you know they can put ads in their magazines and they get millions of visitors on their sites so us lowly independents you know have a struggle a lot to promote amongst that
310060	315102	Now, there's a lot of great independent shows nominated, so I'm feeling pretty good that at least some deserving independent will win.
315642	317883	But, of course, we'd like it to be us.
317923	318944	I'm not gonna lie.
319824	324626	So, please, if you enjoy Orange Lounge Radio, consider voting for us in the podcast awards.
326547	328369	DarkSakura will be back next week too.
328409	331692	I had a little note to mention that for those that are DarkSakura fans.
332012	334794	We will still have a classic game of the week and all that fun stuff tonight, so stay tuned.
335535	340139	I want to talk about this story too before we get into the gaming weeks and the news and all that.
340499	343641	And that is this interesting way that gaming maybe is changing.
344222	348365	This little kind of like blink and you miss it story came up this week and it was about FIFA 12.
349306	357908	And especially for a lot of the people in our audience, I know we don't have as many sports games fans, you know, because I know a lot of you guys, we started with music games, a lot of you into role-playing games, some of that too.
358369	361509	But certainly there's the occasional sports game that we all enjoy.
362490	367531	You know, for me, the old NBA Jam, Blades of Steel, a lot of the old school stuff.
368631	377214	But what I think is interesting about this whole FIFA 12 thing is that you can play FIFA 12, at least a demo of it, right, via YouTube.
378274	388921	and I guess it's like a partnership that this company Gaikai is doing with YouTube where you go on and you can go to this page to visit information about FIFA 12 and you can actually stream this demo.
389421	392163	You don't download anything to your computer or what have you.
392243	393024	It's like OnLive.
393184	397306	This is basically an OnLive competitor but no standalone client.
397326	399048	I guess it's all run through Java or what have you.
399528	400308	So you can go on
401289	409336	Check out this game and stream it and all the graphics and everything through the magic of the cloud gaming and all that stuff.
409356	411437	So you're not really downloading a whole lot to your computer.
411998	417763	And while this might not seem like such a big deal at first, I kind of go like, okay, well, hold on a minute.
419324	421065	If this is...
422046	426712	Going on YouTube, which is how we watch a lot of movies and music videos now.
426773	429056	I mean, does MTV play music videos anymore?
429616	429817	No.
430197	430938	Sometimes.
431399	432660	Where do we get our music videos?
432700	433982	I think they have a show that does that.
434022	435604	Like one show that comes on at midnight?
436526	436786	All right.
437134	438675	Beavis and Butthead is coming back this week.
439215	440556	So that's old school.
440616	441937	That is awesome.
443558	444218	But what does this mean?
444498	446539	Do you think this could mean anything for the future of gaming?
446559	449541	Because now we've got two companies that are going into cloud gaming.
450241	454624	And later on tonight we're going to get into rumors about the Xbox and whatever next is for them.
454644	455905	And then PlayStation 4.
457866	460447	Could this be technology that we see built into consoles?
460507	462288	Is this something that's going to go wider?
463089	463449	Do you think?
464150	472536	This kind of reminds me of that Vaporware console that was announced around the time the 360 and the PS3 were, which was, I believe, the Phantom.
472916	478720	If you remember that, where you could sign up to sign up to get the preliminary launch announcement.
478801	483084	I do remember that, and I think that's why a lot of people kind of laughed at OnLive when it first came out.
483424	484985	And then I remember going to that E3.
485245	487207	Were you at that E3, Loki, or was that the year after you went?
487467	490049	Okay, remember when OnLive was there on the floor, and it was like...
490689	492030	Holy shit, it works!
492450	495273	Like, a lot of people were like, okay, wait, where's the box?
495433	496193	What's the trick?
496534	499436	And like, that was really people's reaction to OnLive is, holy shit, it works.
499776	504940	Now OnLive's biggest challenge is getting the games on the service, you know, they don't really have a lot, unfortunately.
505561	506381	But it works.
506602	509764	But yeah, the Phantom and all that kind of made people skeptical.
509964	512887	It wasn't so much a gaming console as it was a gaming appliance.
513607	528515	but that didn't really seem like you know there was no way to actually load media onto it it was all kind of DLC or all streaming and that seems like well why can't you just do that on a computer once they can figure out the parity between the bandwidth and the response time and it sounds like it's here so
529315	531977	Yeah, but do you think this is something that we could see?
532017	537782	I mean, you know, right now we have Xbox Live Arcade where you download these little games to the console, you know, PlayStation Network.
538042	542065	Do you think there's going to come a time where we stream games through these services?
542565	547609	Absolutely, because, I mean, as bandwidth gets better, it's going to get even easier to stream something like that.
548410	551953	And, I mean, they're only a couple hundred meg at most.
552033	554595	I mean, well, some are like a couple gig, but...
555295	560218	You know, they have limits in size and stuff to what they can put on Xbox Live Arcade.
560798	576686	So, it would be possible to stream something like that, or if they have a way to where they can split the game up, you know, by level or whatever, so that you start streaming the beginning, and as you progress through the game, you know, the rest of the levels are streaming in, then, yeah, definitely, it's something they could do.
576726	579908	Plus, you know, with all the announcements, like, a couple weeks ago, where...
580989	594640	You know, both Unreal's now being supported in web browsers and, you know, also Crytek is looking at getting the CryEngine in, you know, to Flash as well.
594760	596902	So, you know, with that stuff coming about.
598024	602767	Yeah, I can definitely see them doing a lot more gaming on demand type stuff through web browsers.
602907	605869	Because, I mean, that way you don't even have to sell a console.
606069	608910	So that could be kind of bad news for consoles, actually, if you think about it.
609511	614734	Could you imagine in the future, I mean, this might be actually a horrible thing, or maybe we're already there, I don't know.
615114	617335	But remember how we would go to arcades?
618596	621138	Remember the arcade when they weren't full of ticket machines?
621198	623239	We would go there to, like, play against people and stuff?
623599	635867	I mean, what about a system where you deposit a virtual quarter or a token and play a game streaming against, you know, play around a Soul Calibur 2, or I guess now it would be 5, against somebody long distance?
635967	638389	I mean, I think we're kind of already there.
638789	640050	That won't work, and here's why.
640070	642972	It's because they've tried that already with, like, the iOS stuff.
642992	645113	You have, you know, the Capcom games where you can...
645733	650516	Pay a quarter to play an arcade game on a handheld system or something like that.
650556	652698	And people are like, no, I'm not going to do that.
652718	657501	Yeah, and iOS also sucks for gaming unless the game is built around the touchscreen.
657741	664226	Even if it was on my computer and I had a controller and stuff like that, I would not pay per game.
664766	665566	No, screw that.
666167	666827	I bought the game.
667468	668709	I'm going to play the game like that.
668729	670890	But you used to play 50 cents per round of DDR, right?
671755	673216	Yeah, and that's a little bit different.
673256	677077	Are they going to ship me some pads and ship me a nice arcade system?
677117	682019	Yeah, well, I'll consider it then, but it's not like that.
682199	686781	You're using all my hardware, and all you're doing is sending me the code for your game.
688762	690362	It's being rendered off-site, though, right?
690402	691483	It's just being streamed to you.
693444	695525	Like, you don't need the graphics card or anything, right?
695645	696485	It's in the cloud.
696765	697825	It's all in the cloud.
697885	699046	Through the magic of the cloud.
700487	701388	I don't like the cloud.
702489	703790	Fuck the cloud, is that what you're saying?
704050	704851	Fuck the cloud, yeah.
705351	712537	He was Final Fantasy's best antagonist, and I don't know why.
712577	713218	No, I'm kidding.
713238	721004	You know what also this whole discussion about arcades and things makes me think, and it makes me kind of sad, is that are we ever going to have anything like DDR ever again?
721104	726008	And I don't mean like the game itself, but I mean kind of like the community that that built, which includes this show.
726969	731092	Guitar Hero and Rock Band, right?
731112	732672	That's not what I mean, though.
732713	740437	I'm talking about, we used to go to the arcade to celebrate people's birthdays and sit around the fourth mix machine and watch people fuck off.
740797	746280	The problem is, it's not profitable as much for arcades anymore to have that kind of stuff in their arcades.
746741	753585	So what you need to do is you need to have arcades that really just want that there and find a way to become profitable as well.
754181	758424	How do you get people to leave the couch when it's so easy now to click button play game?
758685	763028	Well, I think it's... I mean, you still can't emulate everything that you can do in the arcade.
763068	769994	I mean, the experiences in the arcade are still going to be vastly superior as far as controls go.
770014	772876	I mean, arcade sticks and stuff like that, yeah, definitely supplement that.
773217	774478	But not everyone's buying that.
774618	776579	And it's still fun to play in the arcade.
776599	777160	But the problem is...
777640	784184	Yeah, a lot of people are playing stuff that they could play in the arcade at home, like fighting games and racing games and stuff like that.
784685	791289	But yeah, dancing games and stuff, I don't think that's really something you can emulate at home.
791329	794030	I'm not even necessarily talking about a dancing game or a music game.
794050	796512	I'm just talking about a game that establishes such a sense of community.
796792	800254	The closest thing I can think of that I see now is maybe some of the racing games.
800434	804397	I do still see Initial D has a pretty big contingent in the racing games in the arcade.
804537	809362	There's fighting, of course fighting games, but it's not as big as it used to be.
809623	814948	Well, there's still communities out there, but they're spread out or they're on Facebook or something like that.
814968	822857	I mean, go to any gaming Facebook page and there's tons of people that are fans of that game on there talking about stuff.
823738	828462	If you want to get people excited about something at the arcade, you make it arcade only.
828522	831885	You make a reason for people to go there constantly.
833066	839972	Whether it be unlocking stuff on the machine or just some unique style of gameplay.
841534	842255	People will go there.
842275	845818	People will have fun and create communities around it.
846398	873889	it's just unfortunately you know like Dance Dance Revolution started really much as an arcade game and yeah there were some of the Japanese versions but for a long time that's all there was was the arcade and that's why people would go there and then they formed a community around it but then once they started coming out with a lot more home versions yeah you don't really necessarily need to go to the arcade anymore yeah but the home versions had crap songs for the longest time yes that's true but then also a lot of the people grew up and they just decided we all turned 30
874429	875851	Shit, Native Society, no.
877032	878473	I've got a lot more things going on.
878573	882257	I can't really make it out to the arcade to go play games.
882317	886041	I mean, it's just, you know, time.
886061	894370	You know, do I go drive, you know, 10 minutes, 15 minutes or whatever to my arcade to go hang out by myself, you know, or...
895089	903111	I think my mind was kind of going in this direction because I'd heard something... Well, DDR Freak officially closed this week.
903171	910914	I mean, I know we had the talk a couple weeks ago about how DDR Freak was closing and the server was offline, but the server came back up for JDog to post a message that said, it's over.
911194	914835	Like, the whole epilogue and the forums are locked down because of spam and everything.
915135	916255	It is officially done.
916295	916755	Game over.
916815	917095	Failed.
917716	919016	You know, that whole thing.
919056	919496	So, I don't know.
919516	922317	It kind of had me thinking about the whole DDR and the community and all that because, you know, it was...
922677	922737	D.D.R.
922777	923017	Freak
950900	959707	I'd heard rumors about, speaking of arcades and communities and all that, the rumors about a DDR get-together for the 20th of November, which I think is supposed to be a Sunday.
960047	962429	But I haven't heard anything about if that's actually happening or not.
962689	963429	But I think it should.
964050	966111	If they're not going to organize something, I think we should.
967812	968233	I don't know.
968733	971575	I'll just have to find out and find out fast.
971595	973036	That's only, what, like four weeks away?
973056	973557	Something like that?
974257	975418	So, don't have a lot of time.
976155	976875	There's no time!
977756	979577	Alright, let's move on.
980317	988981	Let me get a couple more comments from our chatroom at chat.orange.radio.com Derek H. I think is trying to play this FIFA demo online and brings up an interesting point about just how easy this all is.
989041	992282	Derek H. says, This FIFA thing is stalled at starting game.
992342	993343	Please wait a moment.
993683	995944	Now I gotta upgrade Java and the download failed.
996224	998945	I think it would have been faster if they just let me download the demo.
999145	1000166	I don't like Gaikai.
1002268	1031464	and um it's a pretty good point you know as simple as this all might be push button play game doesn't always work it's not always that easy and really I mean yeah the technology is cool and it might be fun to check it out because of the technology but I don't give a crap about FIFA I just don't and I figure you know if I'm gonna play a FIFA demo I have a 360 I can download the demo for that but it's FIFA now but it might be another game later on that you are interested in right yeah I think
1032546	1041489	The genre of games that really stands out to me is that could really take advantage of this are free-to-play MMOs where you don't have to bog down your system with a bunch of crap to install it.
1041529	1048231	You just log into a portal and it's all streamed to you because that's a great way to get the soccer moms or whatever to play because they don't need a graphics card.
1048251	1049332	It's all rendered off-site.
1049792	1052893	So free MMOs and game demos I could see really taking advantage of this.
1053013	1059435	But for the kind of games that we like to play, I don't know, like Arkham City or whatever, you're going to need an installation.
1060235	1062458	on a local device, whether it's a console or PC.
1063098	1067082	But yeah, I think for free MMOs or freemium, this is great technology.
1069844	1073225	Well, we're going to move on into our gaming weeks and the stuff that we've been playing this week.
1073265	1074646	A couple other quick, quick announcements.
1074686	1078968	I forgot to get this out there earlier, but I see some of you guys in chat room are like, I'm voting in the podcast awards.
1079008	1079208	Yay.
1079488	1080668	So thank you guys so much for doing that.
1080988	1088591	I did want to mention one of the other members of the OL Army, Brad from PodCulture, has a show in his network that's nominated, and we want to throw our support behind him.
1088972	1093133	He is with a show called The Geek Spin, and it's nominated in PodSafe Music.
1093433	1095134	I think it might just be called Music in the awards.
1095154	1095554	I can't remember.
1095574	1096375	It's either PodSafe.
1096415	1097015	It's PodSafe.
1097655	1098656	Loki's been voting for it every day.
1098896	1100456	So it's the geek spin.
1100536	1104678	And so as you're filling out your ballot, because you can vote in one category, you can vote in multiple.
1104959	1112022	Unless there's just some other pod safe music podcast you just really freaking love, we'd appreciate if you'd throw your support to a fellow member of the OL Army.
1112062	1113222	If we can't win, maybe he can.
1113242	1114203	That would be pretty cool.
1115234	1116355	I think that was it.
1117236	1120999	So let's move on to our gaming weeks and the video games that you have been playing this week.
1121359	1122460	Salacious Pop, we'll start with you.
1123901	1129105	Mostly World of Warcraft, of course, and I guessed it on your other podcast to talk about that.
1129245	1133889	So we'll get to it in a minute, but obviously lots of big World of Warcraft news came out.
1134189	1135170	So I played a lot of that.
1135470	1137532	It's in the middle of the Halloween holiday season.
1138212	1143914	I also had an opportunity to play on the PS3 your Sega Genesis arcade collection.
1143974	1150636	I was playing a lot of Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine because someone had commented on how fucking hard that game is.
1151517	1155238	Because I know it's a licensed clone of Puyo Puyo.
1155258	1156298	It's not really Ripoff.
1156878	1158859	They just re-skinned it with their permission.
1159059	1159780	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1177561	1180684	and... Isn't that game a really good deal for like 20 bucks?
1180804	1182325	Because that's what it goes for now, is 20 bucks.
1182505	1185068	Just a little mini rant, because I know you like those.
1185448	1195977	What I love about the Genesis, the Sonic's Best of Genesis collection is that there is some production and polish in how it looks when you load up the disc, but it's mostly just...
1196417	1196918	A list.
1197298	1199500	Here are the ROMs that are on this.
1199600	1203484	Here's a nice, pretty, you know, background screen to list everything out in.
1203524	1206587	And then you just pick the game that you want and it loads up.
1207268	1211432	Unlike another collection that we had an opportunity to play
1211892	1213713	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1237927	1257342	and maybe I'm just an old curmudgeon now but I know there's a lot of controversy about repackaging retro content for a $40 disc when it's just shit that you played when you were 15 or however young you know in the 90s on your Sega Genesis releasing that content on a disc just give me a menu show me that you put some effort into packaging it
1257982	1259804	and just let me pick it from a list.
1260084	1261045	I'm easy to please.
1261225	1264447	You know, and if they want to do the frou-frou stuff, fine, but they should have an easy way.
1264508	1273575	And another thing I liked about the Genesis Collection versus the Namco Megamix, the Genesis Collection has the extra interviews, it has arcade games you can unlock.
1273895	1278999	There's things that you can work towards that aren't too distracting or terrible.
1279040	1281121	You know what I mean?
1281161	1287887	So loading up the Namco Museum and direct Pac-Man to find the game that you want that's in one of these candy-shaped buildings.
1288447	1292191	There's also one other big difference between the Megamix and the Sega Genesis Collection, to be fair.
1292551	1295253	And that is that they have all these new versions of games.
1295774	1301639	One of the ones I played was Rally-X, which has now Pac-Man in the car dodging not ghosts, but just...
1302659	1302999	Boogers.
1303260	1305101	Just boogers and other cars.
1305442	1309686	And it's kind of like a 3D version of Rally X, which kind of ruins the charm of the original game.
1310006	1317393	Like old school 2D games from 1983 don't translate well into 3D on the Wii if you don't change a lot.
1317553	1318314	You know what I mean?
1319836	1321077	The whole thing felt derpy to me.
1321963	1330969	And I want to give a shout out to DDR Dollar Bill in chat because he said that his gaming week was City of Heroes and they just launched their freemium free-to-play model.
1331230	1331990	Oh, did that happen?
1332090	1338554	Which included a cataclysm-like redesign of the starter zones, maybe a minor graphical upgrade.
1338955	1343698	So I'm not really in a situation where I can check that out right now, but I'm just City of Heroes love.
1343798	1344719	I played that game for years.
1344739	1345259	I'm surprised.
1345519	1347040	Why aren't you getting into that?
1347080	1348181	Is it just too much wow?
1349021	1349422	It's free.
1349722	1350663	It runs on your computer, right?
1350863	1351003	Yeah.
1351683	1352803	I'm surprised you're not checking it out.
1353784	1361106	Let me ask you this question too before you wrap up your gaming week because unlike the other show, the people that listen to this show, not everybody's into WoW.
1361126	1363066	In fact, some people quite frankly hate it.
1363466	1364767	So why do you play WoW?
1367267	1376310	Well, what got me onto WoW originally was finding out how many gamer friends that I never really got to see in FaceTime were already playing on a certain server and it was the social aspect of it.
1376950	1377110	So...
1379881	1408008	being able to interact with people that I know and it's very immersive there's definitely stuff to do it's the industry leader for subscriptions for a reason even though that's dwindling which we'll get to in a minute with a future story but I played the hell out of Warcraft 3 and I knew I played the RTS campaign where the Scourge is there and Glitch King and blah blah blah so I didn't hop onto the WoW train immediately because I was still playing City of Heroes to be honest so all right
1409419	1410741	Loki, how was your gaming week?
1410761	1411521	I only played Grand Theft Auto.
1416144	1416604	That's it?
1417104	1418465	Yeah, that's pretty much it.
1418485	1421565	I didn't get in time to play much of anything else.
1421785	1430648	I don't think I played any Dead Rising 2 off the record this week.
1431048	1433768	Gosh, you make it sound like you have a baby or something that takes all your time.
1434549	1436149	No, actually it wasn't the baby that took all my time.
1436209	1438130	It was modding Grand Theft Auto that took all my time.
1438170	1438810	Modding Grand Theft Auto?
1438830	1440090	What are you doing to Grand Theft Auto right now?
1440690	1442171	Just discovering new stuff.
1442911	1443711	New texting games.
1444071	1445391	New techniques on how to do things.
1446292	1446812	All right.
1447192	1448532	And it really occupied all my time.
1449753	1450033	All right.
1450873	1451313	Let's see.
1451453	1452293	My gaming week.
1453153	1456354	I was playing Warcraft as well, because you guys all know I'm into that.
1456594	1459555	Final Fantasy XIV, I'm still kind of juggling the two games a little bit.
1460335	1463076	And I stand by what I said about the game last week.
1463116	1470238	It's getting better, but there's still a lot of room for improvement, and I'm probably not going to pay for it unless some miracle patch makes the game really...
1470538	1487362	and I think a lot of what is ruining Final Fantasy XIV for me the more I play it is that I see how other MMOs including WoW like to put in a lot of quality of life improvements but I feel like the Japanese developers have no concept of what a quality of life improvement is
1488022	1493026	I'm talking about games I see developed over there versus games I see developed over here.
1493126	1501753	In order to do certain quests and stuff, I spend 10 minutes running from point A to point B. How is that fun to just run?
1501813	1508939	I think if they are going to redesign their game, they really need to think about how do we make the game non-stop fun?
1510080	1513523	That's... Because when the game's good, it's pretty good.
1513903	1516546	Like, you know, the battle systems, actually, it's really neat to look at.
1516646	1517246	It's different.
1517507	1520529	You have to think about positioning of your characters as well as what you're doing.
1520549	1522611	You know, it's very much unlike WoW, and I like that.
1522931	1524012	It makes a nice break from WoW.
1524032	1526955	And the storytelling is awesome, and the cutscenes are great.
1527475	1527735	But...
1528736	1533480	When the game is in its downtime, its dead time, it's really dead.
1533620	1538364	If I didn't have a link shell of people to talk to, I would poke my eyes out from boredom.
1538824	1544709	And so I hope the developers are really going to think about how the game can be thrilling for 10 minutes as opposed to every 10 minutes.
1545353	1560657	It sort of reminds me of the argument of what Japanese gamers want versus American gamers, especially with JRPGs and how they're kind of tedious and min-maxy and how they just supposedly love that over there, whereas here we're more... I kind of think that's a cop-out.
1560737	1565179	I don't think people here truly understand what people like over there and vice versa.
1565339	1569160	I think sometimes people make excuses like, oh, it's a cultural thing.
1569520	1570480	It's a cultural thing.
1572421	1572761	I don't know.
1573041	1582088	Yeah, because I heard that those lineage MMOs, which are huge over in that part of the world, are very kind of dry to play, like the grinding that you have to do.
1582288	1584709	But again, I've never played it, so I'm mostly talking out of my ass.
1584990	1589953	And I wonder if it's one of those things, again, where kind of like you in WoW, you know, your friends are there, so you just play it.
1590013	1590554	It's your thing.
1591074	1597418	You know, if all my friends suddenly dropped WoW and went to Final Fantasy XIV, I have to reconsider what I'm saying.
1597679	1600801	Because at least in my 10 minutes of run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run,
1601121	1601762	All over the place.
1602182	1605304	Which is what, when Salacious Pop sees me playing Final Fantasy XIV, that's what he does.
1605324	1609768	Because you play a little sprightling hobbit, halfling little... Lalafell.
1610028	1610528	Lalafell.
1610548	1616853	So it's this cute little munchkin thing and his little legs kick when he runs and he does a lot of running to run from town to town.
1617214	1622398	So I see his little wiggly legs tearing across the countryside and run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run.
1623996	1631125	DarkTetsuya was disappointed that Loki didn't play Skylanders this week, so what's up with Skylanders?
1640956	1651363	I don't have any sales data yet, and I was just checking on that, because the VG charts only has up through the 15th, and they came out on the 16th, so there's nothing yet.
1651483	1652163	So we'll know soon.
1652323	1659347	But I mean, based on the report I heard last week from a retail, I mean, that's just one retail person in one store, but it seems to be selling well.
1659367	1667052	But then again, I went to Target, and I saw plenty of copies of the game and all the little dollies, which I got to admit, there was a moment where I kind of went,
1669381	1673167	And then I just heard Loki in my brain going, No!
1675470	1675771	Listen.
1675791	1676973	Uh-oh.
1678875	1679716	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1699429	1700470	And a portal.
1723021	1723462	Play the game.
1723522	1724162	Okay, seriously.
1725523	1731989	You start off with three figures, and it's three different elements, I guess.
1732330	1734431	There's a total of eight different elements in the game.
1734471	1739696	In order to see everything in the game, you have to buy all eight elements.
1740537	1747003	And so you only have three characters to start off with, so that's another $40 you've got to spend to see everything that's in the game.
1747623	1751728	Of course, then you also have to buy the expansions to see what's in there as well.
1751788	1754691	So that's another, you know, $40 on top of that.
1754751	1755853	So $80 right there.
1755873	1760558	But to be fair, I mean, there's a lot of video games that have download content.
1760578	1763922	And if you want to see it all, quote unquote, you know, all the levels and stuff.
1764122	1767224	Okay, that's fair that a lot of games have download content.
1767524	1770026	But to see everything on the disc, I don't have to spend another $40.
1772847	1777650	Which is $40 on top of a game that's already too expensive as it is.
1778350	1787296	And then on top of that, to entice kids to beg their parents for more characters, you can unlock abilities for characters you don't own.
1787716	1789237	And then there's an ability...
1789497	1794681	It basically shows you a preview video of how awesome that character is and how badly you need it.
1795962	1798905	It's to get kids to say, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, I want, I want, I want.
1799705	1804790	I've driven to four fucking targets looking for this figurine for Skylanders and I can't find it.
1805717	1811138	And I see a lot of these blogging sites or whatever talking about how expensive it would be to buy everything and how it's like $300 or something like that.
1811158	1812319	Yeah, you're right up to a point.
1812339	1812639	That's wave one.
1828703	1829844	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1847825	1850429	Going to our chat room, and I apologize if I'm mispronouncing this name.
1850449	1857500	I think it's Zezbi, Zizbi, in our chat room, says, My mom bought this for my eight-year-old brother for his birthday.
1857841	1859263	I tried to get her to return it.
1859463	1862348	I then cried because she is now a tool and I can't prevent it.
1862779	1863419	Well, here's the thing.
1863559	1866160	I don't have a problem with people buying download content for the game.
1866260	1879922	If this was, say, for example, a game that didn't have any toys whatsoever, and they had a total of 30 characters, but each one cost a buck on, you know, the PlayStation Arc, yeah, that would still be stupid, but buying a character for a dollar, not that bad.
1880182	1886524	Buying a stupid inanimate object that's $8 and it doesn't do anything, and I saw a lot of, like...
1888297	1889920	You know, Kotaku, gotta love them.
1890020	1893467	But, you know, one of their excuses, well, see, these toys are awesome.
1893527	1895451	My kids are playing chess with them.
1897145	1898025	Thanks for watching!
1919372	1920712	It's seriously a cash grab.
1920932	1924633	And if it's successful, you can bet that there's going to be more of this shit later on.
1924693	1927874	I don't need another 30-minute opening segment about Skylanders.
1928194	1929955	So can I move on and talk about the last game of my week?
1930215	1934816	Let's talk about Cash Grab 2, a bargain basement game that's pretty good for your value.
1934876	1942057	And it's seriously right up the frickin' alley of the people that listen to this show, at least the ones that started with us and all that, because it's a music-based game.
1942918	1947779	A game I bought this week on Steam that just went on sale, I believe, over the weekend is a game called Sequence.
1948719	1953282	and it is, get this, it's a DDR role-playing game.
1954103	1960727	It's DDR mixed, but not like the actual DDR game, but it's that whole idea, the Falling Arrows mixed with a role-playing game.
1961127	1964970	And it's $4.50 right now on Steam, which I think the regular price is going to be $5.
1965070	1968532	I also believe, if I remember correctly, it's also an Xbox indie game.
1968592	1968832	It is.
1968912	1976317	It started as an Xbox Live indie game, but once the Cthulhu people went over to Steam and were like, shit, we made more money in a day on Steam.
1976337	1977818	Yeah, exactly.
1978018	1979119	Rock Band for the DS or the PSP
2001477	2004499	Okay, kind of, I guess you could say, except like... It's all you.
2004859	2008101	One won't stop just because you get a perfect note pattern in one.
2008502	2010983	One of them is for defending or preventing damage.
2011384	2012845	One of them is for casting spells.
2013005	2015006	One of them is for regenerating mana for your spells.
2015426	2018809	And the way it all works together, I gotta admit, is really cool.
2019209	2022691	Like, the whole design of the game, it's something kind of new.
2023112	2026614	It's mixing two genres together that I think people are into.
2026734	2031137	And I think for people that enjoy music games or role-playing games, you've gotta see what they've done here.
2032659	2036184	It is a $5 game, and so it has the production values of a $5 game.
2036604	2041111	Some of the voice acting leaves some things to be desired.
2041572	2043494	But the writing is actually very witty.
2043895	2044656	It's very witty.
2044736	2047139	You can tell there's a lot of inspiration from GLaDOS.
2047680	2049581	It's very modern, the game.
2051241	2053002	So I like kind of what they've done with that.
2053962	2056163	I'm not criticizing the voice actors.
2056183	2071668	I'm just saying the way the voice acting is delivered, it really sounds like the two were recorded, at least in the stages I've played, the intercom gal and the main character that you play, it's kind of obvious the two were recorded separately because they don't ever talk on top of each other.
2071708	2074029	They don't have a natural interaction with each other.
2074529	2094328	and maybe I'm just kind of picky when it comes to stuff like that but I just you know I noticed it but I'm not going to say like oh my god the game is like worthless because the voice acting was not done professionally no it's the game itself it's neat and it's the kind of thing where I go I really want to see what they're going to do with a sequel
2095359	2099281	Because, you know, again, when I say role-playing game, unfortunately, there's no overworld.
2099541	2100462	There's no map.
2100822	2103183	It's just you kind of choose from a menu.
2103243	2105024	Do you want to go out and battle another creature?
2105305	2110367	Do you want to work on synthesis to get more items so you are better defended and have more hit points?
2110788	2115630	Or do you want to work on, you know, what kind of stuff do you want to do from within this room?
2115891	2121134	So I feel like with this concept, there's so much more that can be done with it if people will just throw money at it.
2122154	2122775	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2141953	2147656	It's kind of, you know, it's not really like pop music or anything like that.
2147716	2154420	It's very like video gamey, you know, kind of indie artist type stuff, but it's not bad by any means.
2154540	2162764	And, you know, because my brain is still preoccupied, I tell you, it takes a lot to like be thinking in the concept of, okay, I'm playing over here.
2162964	2163484	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2192932	2195613	Alright, that does it for our gaming weeks.
2195854	2199155	So I want to quickly plug a few Orange Lounge Radio related things.
2199195	2200376	And that would be our Facebook.
2200416	2203057	If you're not our friend on Facebook, why not?
2203177	2204278	Don't you want to have another friend?

2208780	2210161	You can also follow us on the Twitters.
2210621	2227963	Twitter.com slash OLR We will be taking your Twitter comments a little later on in the show Twitter.com slash OLR If you want to send us some app messages with your thoughts on anything you're hearing about on tonight's program Let's get into some news Loki's going to start us off tonight
2229198	2235822	So the PlayStation Vita's got a release date now for Europe and North America and I guess the Middle East and Australia.
2237082	2237522	February 22nd.
2237542	2240184	It's kind of odd, that's a Wednesday.
2241324	2244186	Odd release date, but yeah, it'll be coming out.
2244206	2247607	Of course, they are quick to remind you that it's $249.99 without 3G and $299.99 with 3G.
2247627	2249088	Honestly, I'd just stick without 3G and...
2256428	2258791	Tether to my phone if I really want 3G.
2259572	2260694	Although I don't think I'll ever.
2260934	2262997	But Loki, I must game on the go.
2265320	2270547	I mean, it's a good idea if you want to do 3... I just don't know what the data plans are with that.
2270608	2273031	And 3G stuff, you know, it...
2274258	2286865	Have they really announced... Is this something where I can take it to any provider that has 3G and say, hey, I want my PlayStation Vita to run on your service?
2286885	2290827	Because this isn't like the iPhone or anything where, hey, it's certain...
2292128	2293669	Certain places will give it to you.
2293829	2297632	And also, the other thing you might want to wait and see is if they do have some sort of data plan.
2298252	2304456	A lot of times, usually with the iPads and phones and stuff like that, they'll offer you some sort of discount on the system.
2304516	2309740	So you might want to wait and see what the providers announce.
2311061	2313582	Some new launch titles have also been announced.
2313662	2316204	Coming from Namco, of course, Ridge Racer.
2317145	2320147	Ridge Racer, serving the launches of systems since the beginning of time.
2322208	2327430	Shinobito, and Touch My Katamari.
2328830	2331691	Those will be coming alongside the Vita in North America.
2331751	2333211	Touch My Katamari, really?
2333651	2336072	Yeah, I believe that's actually coming out already.
2336612	2343454	Well, obviously the Vita is launching a little bit earlier in Japan, but I believe it's also with their launch as well.
2344794	2346555	Is that a bowling minigame I see there?
2347577	2355889	I don't think it's a minigame, I think it's just part of what you roll up I like Katamari I'd play that
2357629	2363452	Yeah, I mean, the Katamari franchise has been kind of meh ever since the creator left, but I don't know.
2363492	2364012	You never know.
2364032	2369854	There might always be that renaissance Katamari game that's a lot of fun again.
2370154	2373956	The one on PlayStation 3 wasn't bad, but it was also kind of a rehash of all the old games.
2374396	2376257	It was like a best hits of Katamari.
2376377	2382459	And knowing Namco, I wouldn't be surprised if this is a rehash of a rehash of a rehash of a rehash.
2382480	2383440	Yeah.
2385596	2385917	Who knows?
2386997	2391021	But it's kind of neat.
2391141	2392622	Do you think you're going to get one of these at launch?
2392882	2393463	I know I am.
2393643	2394624	I really don't have a choice.
2395364	2398067	I'd like to, but it all depends on how much money I get.
2399268	2402270	But I think I could probably scrounge up that kind of dough.
2402731	2405533	I will definitely be setting the money aside to get it.
2405573	2405973	I got to.
2406394	2406794	Got to have it.
2407094	2414600	I just, you know, the reason I want it is because I think they're going to do a Grand Theft Auto game for it, and I gotta have a Grand Theft Auto game.
2414620	2421164	I mean, Grand Theft Auto on PSP, we actually, we were kind of talking about it, especially since they've been showing the, you know, Grand Theft Auto 3 stuff.
2421204	2431252	It's like, man, it'd be fun to go back and play Liberty City Stories again, but that game was really old, and it would be such a learning curve again.
2433872	2436113	Salacious Pop, how do you feel about the PlayStation Vita?
2436213	2443215	I know you don't exactly probably want to run out and buy one day one, but let's say you had the disposable income.
2443275	2445455	Is this something that calls to you?
2445735	2446195	Absolutely.
2446255	2447355	It's a sexy piece of hardware.
2447555	2449816	I like how it looks.
2450496	2452217	I didn't know you felt so strongly about it.
2452577	2452857	No, it's...
2455237	2456698	do you have feelings for the PlayStation Vita?
2456718	2479687	the PSP for me was I think it's an underrated piece of hardware because the DS of course just mud stomped everything in the handheld market and the PSP is a competent little nice device that displays well and is a great system I think the Vita again is going to be a nice piece of technology but the 3DS hasn't really started to wreck people yet
2479927	2481328	Here's the thing about the 3DS, too.
2481368	2488552	I mean, we don't really know, aside from the ever-delayed Kid Icarus, what's really their plan beyond 2011.
2488972	2493095	I mean, it's just like, hey, we got Kid Icarus, because that's been delayed forever.
2494095	2499979	I mean, they've got the two Mario games that are going to be coming out this holiday, but they haven't really said too much.
2501119	2505522	There was stuff at E3 and some other conference, but I don't remember any of that damn shit.
2505922	2510345	So, you know, since they're not keeping it fresh in my mind, that makes me think that they don't really have a plan.
2510986	2518831	And they're really going to need a plan when the Vita comes out because, you know, people may think otherwise.
2518851	2522534	Well, we do have expansion firmware related news coming up later.
2522594	2523294	And, you know, it's...
2525535	2526056	It's upgrades.
2526476	2527756	It's upgrades from what's there now.
2528176	2534858	One thing that I think might keep some people from buying a Vita is that, kind of like the PSP, it's almost too nice.
2535659	2538740	Let's say you can afford the price point.
2539120	2543181	It's such a nice piece of hardware, but it's like, I don't want to put this in my pocket or carry this around.
2543201	2543561	This is a nice...
2545782	2547003	Spaghing to get me mugged.
2566491	2573257	Yeah, and it's weird that it almost looks too nice of a piece of thing that you want to take outside the house.
2573377	2573698	I don't know.
2573978	2580404	Right now, the launch games, there's not really much been announced because they didn't really know when the date of the Vita was.
2580464	2584688	And I know there's maybe four or five games that I actually know that are coming out at launch right now.
2585669	2587610	Some I don't even know if they've been announced yet, but like...
2589335	2592196	Lego Harry Potter, which I... Yippee!
2592316	2593076	That's not for me.
2593997	2596597	Army Corps of Hell, that looks pretty cool.
2596757	2602779	Dragon's Crown, and... Well, Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3.
2604280	2612943	But at least, kind of like a point you brought up with Nintendo, we don't really know what they're doing beyond a year, but with the PlayStation Vita, we know, like, hey, Final Fantasy X is coming at some point.
2613183	2613263	And...
2614443	2622487	And with the Vita, I gotta say, the launch lineup is looking a hell of a lot better, even with not much announced already than the 3DS launch.
2624127	2638634	And also with the 3DS, there's still, and this is gonna come up later in the show, there's still that weirdness with that button, that right analog add-on, which is coming to America, which we're gonna bring up later, and does that mean that we're gonna get a new device altogether?
2639974	2643496	It's like that awkward friend you don't really want to invite over, but you kind of have to.
2647112	2649133	Yeah, so there's a lot in the air right now for the 3DS.
2669146	2672669	The huge, huge MMO World of Warcraft had a new expansion announced.
2672729	2674811	It's the Mists of Pandaria.
2675431	2688702	This was the name that had earlier been rumored thanks to a trademark filing earlier in the year, but it was confirmed that the Pandarans, yes, that's panda people, will be the new playable race in WoW for both the Alliance and the Horde.
2688722	2691604	You're going to be choosing at level 10 which side you're going to go on.
2691624	2692345	So that's the first race.
2692365	2696168	So they're going to finally add, like, you know, slash Panda Express now?
2696188	2696368	Yeah.
2696508	2697069	Womp womp
2714065	2738320	Also coming in the expansion, the Monk class, the level cap is raised to level 90 Some brand new endgame things to participate in, a dungeon challenge mode where your item levels will be capped And you're going to go after gold, silver, and bronze medals in the various dungeons in the game That actually sounds really cool, I'm going to be very interested in that PvE scenarios, for people that like the big PvP battlegrounds without their PvP
2738920	2755505	is basically what it sounds like and a new pet battle system that is basically Pokemon Blizzard has realized that a lot of people really like the pet collecting aspect of the game so they're expanding this whole new mini game into it now where you're going to have a Pokemon battle system
2755925	2768332	Basically, you're going to have different talents on your pets and your pets can use three of them at a time and they battle each other and you can even go around the world and fight master trainers to get new abilities.
2769092	2771894	They are not even being shy about what they're ripping off here.
2772834	2774475	If Nintendo ain't gonna do it, then...
2796644	2798606	Supposedly it eats one of the other pets.
2798946	2805472	For Stephen King fans, if you've seen the movie Creepshow, and I know you don't like horror, it's the monster in the crate.
2805512	2806914	It's the creepy crate from Creepshow.
2807254	2807995	That 80s movie.
2808095	2808755	That's what it is.
2809596	2810477	Okay, I gotcha.
2811638	2811678	Um...
2813079	2820902	Also, apparently there's going to be pets that you can only find out in the world, like at certain times of day or during the spring.
2821302	2824924	I mean, wasn't that the kicker in the last Pokemon game on the DS?
2825004	2827105	Like there was Pokemon you can only catch at certain times of day and stuff?
2828765	2831986	If only there were a way to change the time on my DS.
2833307	2834127	Oh, wait.
2834207	2838569	Except now you can't change the time on the Blizzard server, so it's going to be interesting to see.
2839209	2843011	I've already seen some people trolling that this is just going to be like the dance studio.
2843111	2845572	They're showing us green caps now, but it's never going to happen.
2846693	2851995	I think it will because what I'm liking about this expansion, I could care less about the panda.
2852436	2853816	Well, the monk sounds interesting.
2853836	2856398	I'll try a monk, but panda people, whatever.
2856478	2856958	I'm over it.
2857492	2877867	but as somebody who doesn't always get a chance to raid because I'm in more of a social guild where I really just want to be with my friends but I could see like a group of about five people in that guild getting really into this stupid pet battle thing so I like that it's giving people something else to do besides dungeons and raids and for that I give them credit
2878208	2886791	Yeah, they've really buffed up stuff for casual players, and also PvP is getting new, entirely new game concepts.
2886811	2887331	Murderball.
2887371	2888752	Murderball and a bunch of other stuff.
2888792	2892853	Maybe they should add it to Final Fantasy XIV since there's a lot of waiting for party.
2893674	2894134	You're funny.
2894714	2895534	All right.
2896095	2902077	So anyhow, that's pretty much all the big news with World of Warcraft, except one other thing, right, SalaciousPop?
2902097	2902377	Yeah.
2903973	2904934	Is that me or is it Loki?
2905254	2905734	No, that's you.
2905935	2906255	All right.
2907376	2907656	All right.
2907736	2912280	Okay, so World of Warcraft at one time had 12 million subscribers, right?
2912660	2913761	Top MMO in the world.
2914362	2918185	Well, Blizzard has another game coming out called Diablo 3.
2919046	2929174	And they have this promotion where it's like, all right, how can we do some damage control on the fact that we're hemorrhaging subscriptions and also maybe cross-pollinate our WoW audience with Diablo 3?
2929714	2930975	And what they've come up with is...
2931816	2939762	If you have a WoW license on your Battle.net account as of October 18th, so it's already too late to buy a new WoW license for this.
2939842	2941923	So this is somewhat of a loyalty program.
2942023	2944265	Yeah, it's pretty much damage controlled.
2945286	2951990	You agree to a year of WoW billed at the regular $14.99 every 30 days.
2952010	2954272	You're just saying that you're going to do that for 12 months out.
2954792	2957754	You're going to get a free digital download license of Diablo 3.
2959055	2978166	you're going to get access to the Mists of Pandaria beta probably the very last stage of it after the everyone who signs up gets to play anyway like after they do friends and family and after the NDA whatever has been lifted so that and you get a Diablo themed pretty badass looking mount for your WoW account in World of Warcraft
2979607	2981268	So yeah, there are some conditions.
2981368	2984950	Obviously, you need to have WoW on your Battle.net account as of last Wednesday.
2985810	3005500	In the terms and conditions of the agreement, if you, for whatever reason, your credit card stops working and you don't make your payments, I believe they can pull the Diablo 3 license from your Battle.net account simply because you have to log in to Battle.net because of the real ID and stuff when you play Diablo 3.
3005960	3033978	and Diablo 3 is very controversial because it's going to be online only and now we have now we really we see another reason why which to fuel all that anger that people had before about they can't play Diablo 3 offline now here's another reason why because these people that are going to get the game for free they're going to need to connect every time to make sure their credit cards didn't bounce and just to reiterate if you sign up for this loyalty agreement your cancel button is grayed out you can't cancel it's a cell phone contract in video games it's a
3035451	3058278	and the timing can't be better because if you do this because obviously hell yeah people want Diablo 3 it's going to be one of the biggest games of either next year probably you know we've got Star Wars MMO of the Old Republic coming out Guild Wars 2 and whatever else they're saying you can go play those games if you want but you're paying for WoW for a year regardless so you can have fun we got your money
3062581	3064703	It's genius.
3064943	3068887	It's absolute genius on Blizzard's part is to lock people in.
3069267	3075573	Lock in your loyal customers that are going to say, shit, I'm going to play WoW for the next year anyway and you're going to give me Diablo 3 free?
3075773	3076754	Fuck yeah, I'm in.
3077154	3082639	But now you can't make flirty eyes with Star Wars MMO and you can't go off and cheat with Guild Wars 2.
3082859	3084561	You can, you're just paying for both.
3084801	3098998	Blizzard will still have your money you're not going to be tempted to cut WoW for the other and that's I think part of the reason why they're also saying well it's like a loyalty thing you have to already be a customer this is to lock those 11 million people in best they can
3099624	3109947	If you already have a relationship with WoW and you're on the fence as to how long you're going to be with WoW, this is to basically say, pony up, we're going to keep you and this is how we're going to do it.
3110388	3113949	This isn't for people that have been thinking about trying out WoW.
3114849	3117510	This isn't a way to hop on both trains.
3118126	3119507	You know what's interesting about this too?
3119567	3132275	I don't even know if this got brought up on the other show when we were talking about it, but yeah, you're going to get Diablo 3 free, but what else is going to come out while you're locked into this 12-month plan?
3132735	3133536	Mists of Pandaria.
3134156	3139699	So if you really want the full WoW experience that you've now committed to, you're going to have to get Mists of Pandaria.
3140800	3143802	So you may not have to buy Diablo 3, but you're going to have to buy the other game.
3145100	3151676	I mean, I guess you don't have to, but you know that they're thinking everybody's going to that's locked in if they're locked into their WoW account.
3152225	3160370	For the previous WoW expansion, Wrath of the Lich King, a lot of people killed the Lich King, which was the end boss, supreme raid boss of that expansion.
3160710	3166734	And then they canceled their WoW all through the summer and they didn't sign up until Cataclysm came out in December.
3166774	3168876	So they got to save money by just saying, I'm going to be back.
3168916	3169896	I'm just taking five months off.
3170256	3171517	You can't really do that with this.
3172098	3175019	You can't, you know, we killed Deathwing in Cataclysm.
3175060	3178682	You can't quit and come back for Mists of Pandaria if you're paying for this promotion.
3178702	3178802	Right.
3179582	3182603	I want to clarify because some folks in chat are talking about how the payment works.
3182703	3183283	Here's the deal.
3183783	3187384	You're not agreeing to any type of payment plan with this.
3187745	3190365	You're agreeing to keep your account current for 12 months.
3190745	3193966	You can still pay with the cards, the prepaid cards.
3194286	3197167	So if you never want to give Blizzard your credit card, apparently you still don't have to.
3197207	3198388	You can use the prepaid cards.
3199548	3199988	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3215084	3217446	Well, you can't do a 12-month lump sum.
3217686	3220768	I know people are thinking that or that you have to pay that up front, but you can't do 12.
3221569	3224271	It's the same payment methods that were always there.
3224611	3227153	You can do one month at $14.99 a month.
3227493	3230775	You can do three-month lump sum at $13.99 a month.
3231175	3235718	Or you can do what I did, the six-month lump sum at $12.99 a month.
3235899	3241983	So this month I'll have to pay $77, which is going to be six months of WoW, which I know I'm going to be playing anyway because I have the other show.
3242764	3247156	And then in April, around the time I get my tax refund, I'll have to pay the other $77.
3247517	3249162	And then I'll be good for the year.
3249383	3250847	So I kind of figure it'll work.
3251109	3258772	Yeah, that's good because I was on the three-month plan because $40 once a quarter is reasonable and it's a dollar off what you'd be paying monthly.
3259272	3262994	I thought that you had to roll over to $14.99 every 30 days with this promotion.
3263014	3263434	No, you do not.
3263454	3264694	So it's great to hear that you can.
3264714	3265275	No, you do not.
3265715	3266795	You can pick.
3266835	3271737	You can still do the three-month, but I think you have to have some type of recurring thing on file.
3272177	3275699	But if you end up using the prepaid cards, then you're fine.
3276319	3279100	You'll never get charged because you keep stocking up with prepaid cards.
3279540	3285861	But obviously, if they're going to give you a $50 game for free, they want to make sure that you're going to make good on your promise.
3286681	3290882	Because I don't see Blizzard sending bill collectors after people if they don't make good on their payments.
3291062	3296303	What if you get Diablo 3 through this promotion and then you make IRL money with the new Diablo 3 Auction House thing?
3296323	3299523	Blizzard will shut that shit down if you don't make good on your payments.
3299563	3300344	That's something to think about.
3300784	3308365	And what I really want to come to with this, I know some of you could give a shit about WoW and Diablo and all that stuff, like Loki probably doesn't really give a shit about this.
3308385	3308805	That is correct.
3308985	3338205	but here's what I do want to say with this and Loki where I can get your opinion is that now that Blizzard has thrown that idea out there precedent has been set precedent has been set imagine it Loki next year sign up for a year of Xbox Live and get free Halo maps PlayStation Plus to an extent is somewhat like this we'll give you free games but the minute you stop paying for PlayStation Plus they're gone
3339662	3341003	Yeah, I could see that.
3341264	3344847	I mean, I already pay for live, so I don't really care.
3345708	3348711	I mean, that's just my thing, because I do play online every day.
3349492	3350814	Well, almost every day.
3351474	3353376	So, it's not like I can go without it.
3355819	3359743	And I already renew a year prepaid every time, so...
3361590	3362471	Yeah, that's cool.
3362491	3364752	If you want to give me some more free shit on top of that, cool.
3364952	3369415	I probably don't give a crap about it, especially if it's Halo maps or even Halo a game.
3369555	3371296	You know, I don't care.
3373197	3378901	I got to say, though, I mean, I know there's a lot of chatter on the Internet and a lot of people and, of course, a lot of cynicalness about this.
3379181	3381903	And I understand it is, you know, I have to admit.
3383123	3410776	I did have a big hesitation about doing this because it's signing a contract with a video game company that's a little weird to me it's really weird but at the end of the day I realized look I'm gonna pay for this game for a year I know I'm gonna be doing this I have the other show that's not going anywhere anytime soon and I know I'm buying Diablo 3 like I know I'm buying I'm in the beta right now I love it I need more of it I'm gonna buy Diablo 3 so for me this is great it's not for everybody this deal is not for everybody in fact
3412256	3415757	Most people that are probably making fun of this probably aren't even eligible for it anyway.
3416097	3418118	Because you have to be a current WoW subscriber.
3418458	3419618	So this isn't for everybody.
3419658	3422199	This is just Blizzard's way of making sure you're going to stay loyal.
3422579	3425080	And they'll give you a little something extra.
3425500	3427661	I mean, at the end of the day, I said, you know what?
3427861	3429921	I'm going to end up paying for WoW anyway, and I know it.
3430241	3431442	I might as well get Diablo 3 free.
3432813	3435975	By the way, and there's another... Isn't there something a little less on this too?
3436215	3443980	Yeah, I was going to mention Blizzard always puts out very sexy collector's editions, whether it be for a WoW expansion or for StarCraft or whatever.
3444720	3449543	So, of course, Diablo 3 collector's edition is going to have some nice swag in it, some bonus stuff.
3450103	3456907	Namely, the big one is going to be a USB drive with a little Diablo skull caddy that you can put the drive in.
3457407	3459449	And on that drive is Diablo 2, and I believe...
3460169	3461949	It's expansion, at least I would hope so.
3462069	3465010	You can then install off the USB drive or play off the USB drive.
3465670	3472611	You're going to get the WoW mount that you would also get for doing this annual subscription with the free copy if you're an existing WoW.
3472831	3473511	So you get the mount.
3474291	3480292	But also, if you're thinking, well, I want to do this 12-month promotion and get the game for free, but that's the standard edition.
3480673	3488974	If I go to Fry's or Best Buy and I'm going to drop $80 for this hella Diablo 3 box edition because it's badass, that's going to screw me over for the promotion.
3489855	3500347	What's going to happen is if you apply that collector's edition code to your Battle.net account with the 12-month promotion thing on it, they're going to add four months free to your WoW subscription.
3500908	3504132	So you are going to make up that money somehow.
3504192	3504713	More WoW!
3504753	3505414	More WoW!
3505654	3507136	Pay 12 months of WoW, get more WoW.
3507196	3508097	So there you go.
3509566	3525200	I don't want to dwell too much on this, but again, I think the precedent here, don't be surprised if Activision, the parent company, isn't looking at this going, hmm, how could we sell more Skylanders dolls by getting people to commit?
3525900	3527542	How much do you love your Skylanders?
3529025	3529425	We'll see.
3529706	3534970	I don't know if it would really work with anything other than a subscription service.
3535130	3540634	Because they kind of already do that with Call of Duty Elite.
3541054	3541975	It's a one-year fee.
3542375	3544557	It's not like, hey, you have to sign a contract.
3545377	3546038	We just have one fee.
3547199	3548800	I don't know.
3548900	3551322	They would have to put out more MMOs, I would imagine.
3552731	3554496	Alright, well let's move on with some more gaming news.
3554576	3554857	Loki.
3556983	3559169	So some non-WOW related stuff.
3562133	3562933	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3592412	3599889	and EA we'll be putting that out in 2012 it's going to be put out by EA Tiberian and uh
3601482	3602023	It's kind of neat.
3602103	3609009	They've got pretty much the same gameplay style as before, plus a little bit of Madden Flare thrown in there.
3612392	3627445	I guess they also say that you have a currency system called Blitz Bucks, where you can boost your teams and modify them in a bunch of different ways, as well as custom modes and loading screens, stat boosting type stuff.
3628647	3632350	and also custom rosters.
3632450	3636574	You can set up a survival mode called Blitz Gauntlet.
3637495	3641539	And I guess that's where you take on several teams back to back.
3642379	3645102	And then also they have online gameplay as well.
3645883	3646884	So that should be pretty big.
3648010	3657300	Yeah, I have to admit, you know, again, I'm not super into sports games, but if I was into a game that was like football, it would be NFL Blitz.
3657560	3659462	And I like the arcade-y sports games.
3659502	3661204	Yeah, and it's not too big of a surprise.
3661224	3663747	I mean, come on, they have NBA Jam, so, you know.
3664848	3668952	And apparently from another article that I read, um...
3670294	3683054	it actually got leaked out by somebody a while back but it was just kind of one of those an industry insider says this and they didn't really have much to back it up but it did leak out a while back
3685475	3686676	So the Madden developers are making NFL Blitz now?
3710565	3710946	Kind of.
3711406	3715691	I mean, it's not the same team, but it's the same building, pretty much, right?
3715711	3716072	Yeah.
3716112	3717593	Kind of just down the hall from each other, right?
3718254	3718454	Yeah.
3718975	3723020	Well, it's not a big surprise, because they've done some different things before.
3723100	3726964	Like, they've tried that... Like, there was...
3729834	3758773	NFL game that they put out a while back well they had NFL Street and that's kind of been sore hit and miss and then they had some NFL game I think it was like All Pro or something like that that was the 2K one but they had another NFL game that was more arcadey a little bit like arena football almost and well they had an arena football game at one time even but yeah they like to experiment with that type of stuff
3760737	3766321	And really, you know, what they should get on the bandwagon for is rugby games because this year is the year of rugby games.
3766722	3770124	And they did have a rugby game back in 06, but it's been a while.
3771365	3774988	All right, let's move on with some more information about Final Fantasy XIV.
3775008	3776889	You know, we've been talking about it a little bit on the show.
3777369	3781873	There's going to be a lot of change coming to that game next year, and it's a little bit unprecedented.
3781893	3784495	You know, we've never really had a MMO where...
3784835	3785395	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3806250	3817003	The quote from the interview I believe which was with VG247 said quote not just the Vita but also smartphones so that kind of access will be allowed.
3817384	3824373	That will open the door to things like applications that people can use to check their inventory or check the market and purchase things from the auctions.
3824833	3828977	So it kind of sounds like what WoW kind of already does, but maybe a little something extra.
3829017	3830758	I mean, who knows what could come with this.
3831218	3842988	By the way, they are also still speaking with Microsoft about an Xbox 360 version, but they are focusing on a PlayStation 3 version right now, saying that basically they promised they were going to make a PlayStation 3 version.
3843028	3845130	They haven't kept it, and they need to fulfill it.
3845430	3850755	But I think at this point it's probably a good thing that they wait until 2.0 is done, until they launch it on the PlayStation 3.
3851235	3858717	And seriously, my God, Microsoft needs to get on the ball with allowing MMOs onto their service.
3859657	3864458	So it'll be interesting to see if that ends up actually happening.
3864498	3866558	Or maybe, who knows, for the next Xbox system.
3866858	3870399	Final Fantasy XI was one of the early, early titles for the Xbox 360.
3870739	3873039	So you never know, it might end up going onto the next console.
3873059	3876000	And that didn't need XP Gold, did it?
3876400	3880182	No, 11 is really unlike any other 360 game.
3880242	3882943	Because if you think about it, Play Online is a joint venture with Sony.
3883343	3884564	You've got a Sony game on a 360.
3884864	3885844	And that was their biller, right?
3885884	3886745	Or their membership thing.
3886805	3887105	Yeah.
3887525	3889346	Now, 14 doesn't use that.
3889486	3890427	It's all kind of separate.
3890447	3894688	But Final Fantasy 11 is really unlike anything else on the 360.
3895409	3899951	And I think Microsoft really bent all the rules to get that game on their console.
3899991	3901512	Because, you know, it was early on.
3901552	3902092	It was a launch.
3902672	3905633	And I gotta say, because I did play XI back in the day, it was pretty awesome on the 360.
3905893	3909153	If you had the keyboard and everything for it, it was a great way to play the game.
3910514	3926397	And I was talking to you about this last night, but luckily for Final Fantasy XIV, it's a gorgeous enough game that if it takes them another year or two to get their shit together, considering how WoW is seven years old and is finally starting to show its age visually...
3926957	3933080	It's pretty enough a game that it will still be relevant by the time they fix it.
3934061	3934221	Yeah.
3934721	3944447	So, I mean, the other thing with the whole PlayStation 3 launch of 2.0 I wanted to kind of reiterate is that remember when Final Fantasy XI came out, in America we got version 2.0 of the game.
3944607	3949569	It was the launch of the game to us because the Rise of the Zillow expansion was included when that game launched here.
3949970	3953452	So we never saw the earliest version of that game, which also I guess was kind of buggy.
3953752	3953972	Yeah.
3954352	3954692	I don't know.
3955053	3959875	It's going to be interesting to see what happens, but don't expect me to pay for the game for a year to find out.
3960796	3961736	That's my big thing.
3962577	3963057	So we'll see.
3964718	3970762	Speaking of MMOs, we get another question in our chat room from... Did I get away?
3971182	3971902	ZHEB?
3972703	3976025	ZHE... I can't pronounce this.
3976485	3977626	ZHSB, I think it is.
3977666	3977846	What?
3978567	3985657	ZHSB in chat says, Do you think Guild Wars 2 will end up being higher quality than WoW?
3986098	3989823	I know it won't be a WoW killer, but I'm still curious to see what you think.
3990024	3993268	Guild Wars' strength will always be its model.
3993789	4018542	and the fact that once you buy the game there is no monthly fee and that is so alluring to a lot of people that don't want to play WoW you know because of that whole thing and that's what makes Final Fantasy 14 good right now is that it's the same model essentially because they're not charging for monthly fee uh Guild Wars 2 looks great but I can't tell you anything else until I can really get my hands on it it's one thing to see the demos on YouTube and I gotta say it looks sexy as hell the graphics look great I'm really excited
4019282	4045314	but again, I gotta get my hands on it until I can really tell you if it's gonna be worth it or not so next year, we'll see alright, let's move on more stories Salacious Pop so of course we all remember back in April when it was the week that Portal 2 and Mortal Kombat came out that PlayStation Network was hacked and everyone was very sad and it was very end of the world
4046634	4059063	And as a result, when all these gaming journalism sites were like, well, how can you avoid having your credit card saved to these servers if they're going to get compromised so often?
4059183	4062745	And one of the solutions was to buy game codes.
4063606	4070971	I know if you go into GameStop, you'll see a whole wall of basically these... They kind of look like gift cards at the supermarket where you're just buying...
4072532	4076034	The code, you're paying, obviously, the retailer for that.
4076074	4084097	You take the code, you load it into your PS3, and you're downloading the game directly without having to put a credit card, put points into your PSN bucket and all that stuff.
4085318	4089219	One of the ways to get these codes was through Amazon.
4089580	4091801	You could buy these cards through Amazon directly.
4092541	4094302	Or I think maybe they just emailed the code to you.
4094742	4097803	And it was a way to get around Sony's shopping cart.
4098023	4101665	And if you're worried about having your credit card information stolen,
4102085	4107208	because Amazon, I think, is a more reputable retailer.
4107468	4112031	Those PSN stores, primarily the ones on Amazon, all that content has been removed.
4112591	4113611	You cannot do that anymore.
4114352	4117854	So for all the people that were using Amazon to get around PSN,
4118374	4120658	Which was a lot more people after the hacks, I'm sure.
4120758	4120998	Yeah.
4121599	4123001	After that whole end of the world thing.
4123021	4127267	And we still haven't heard, I don't think, about anybody really getting screwed over.
4127467	4128509	Meanwhile on Xbox.
4128529	4129530	Yeah, meanwhile on Xbox Live.
4129571	4131854	Another friend of mine, by the way, got hacked this week.
4132094	4132675	Another friend of mine.
4132915	4133276	Just saying.
4135504	4143828	So Amazon has confirmed the removal of the content, and they have no announcements regarding this change in selection, so they're being kind of hush-hush about it.
4144849	4146850	I believe Sony has been nudged.
4146930	4149091	They're PR saying, what's up with Amazon?
4149131	4151793	Why'd they drop your stuff?
4152153	4153393	Sony hasn't responded yet.
4154514	4159878	I doubt that has anything to do with it, but more of that they want more control over that stuff.
4178433	4182175	Yeah, I'm kind of curious as to what's going on there.
4182255	4185717	But maybe it's just they just, for whatever reason, don't want to do it.
4185797	4189319	Maybe they just want to try to get more people to tie their credit cards on PSN.
4189499	4189899	Yeah.
4189919	4190299	Who knows?
4190539	4192140	Yeah.
4192320	4194141	We don't really know if it was Amazon's decision.
4194301	4196162	Maybe because they just didn't sell well.
4196202	4200665	Maybe people just buy those game codes at a retailer, like a brick-and-mortar one.
4201065	4203226	Or maybe Sony's got something competing coming up.
4203486	4203826	Who knows?
4204827	4205007	Yeah.
4205575	4206155	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4223204	4237335	Kirby's Return to Dreamland for Nintendo Wii, Dragon Ball Z Ultimate Tenkaichi on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, Stronghold 3 on PC, and you can actually catapult cows in that game.
4237695	4238516	That's pretty awesome.
4239516	4243957	Uh, Motion Explosion for Xbox 360, another generic party game.
4244917	4248978	Just Dance Kids 2 on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii.
4249158	4250359	Ew, is that like Kidz Bop?
4251139	4256040	You know, it used to be like, kind of like the wheels on the bus go round and round and that kind of bullshit.
4256340	4259641	But, um, actually it's not so much that now.
4259661	4260701	Uh, they do have...
4261361	4266203	Some songs on there, I'm not really sure if I recognize them.
4266243	4269164	Is it just family safe stuff, like old disco songs?
4269564	4270705	Yeah, like some of that.
4271145	4272625	Ooh, pop your pussy, girl.
4273846	4274906	Like that kind of music.
4274926	4275887	Yeah, nothing like that.
4276287	4278247	No, they had some songs listed on here.
4278347	4282069	I don't even know what... Yeah, Shake Your Groove thing, obviously.
4282689	4283429	Whip My Hair.
4284410	4285090	No idea what that is.
4285430	4286210	Despicable Me.
4286230	4287451	Wait, you don't know Whip My Hair?
4287471	4287511	No.
4288157	4288938	No, what's with my hair?
4289678	4290319	Willow Smith?
4291320	4292060	Will Smith's kid?
4292581	4294682	Oh, no, I don't know his song.
4294822	4295143	Sorry.
4295703	4296584	No, no, it's not his song.
4296644	4297365	It's his kid's song.
4297885	4298766	I whip my hair back and forth.
4298786	4300167	You've never heard that song.
4300507	4302989	No, I have not heard that song, and I don't wish to hear that song.
4303009	4304490	Do you live in a cave or something?
4304731	4306652	I don't listen to fucking radio, okay?
4307213	4310795	I'm sorry, it's not one of the ten songs that they play on Top 40 stations.
4310855	4311476	Yes, I know.
4311796	4315039	Top 40, that means they play the same ten songs four times every hour.
4317472	4331597	you have to hear how amazing this song is and by amazing I mean amazingly terrible hold on I'm trying to bring it up in studio right now hold on let's see here if I can get it going props to him I mean I hope that he does just remember she's nine
4344207	4345088	Come on Loki, dance!
4345288	4347611	Okay, I'll stop torturing the listeners.
4347651	4348271	What the hell?
4354787	4358689	She obviously did not inherit her dad's musical talent.
4358709	4361010	She's nine, Loki!
4361090	4361750	Give her a break!
4361770	4362571	Yeah, she's nine.
4362771	4364492	I've seen better, okay?
4364772	4366693	You've seen better nine-year-olds, really?
4366893	4368333	Where, on Toddlers and Tiaras?
4368634	4371455	Because I can't think of where else to see nine-year-olds performing.
4373156	4376918	Well, on America's Got Talent, on The X Factor, on...
4378334	4379756	Oh, are you rooting for What's-Her-Name?
4380397	4381719	No, you see, here's the thing.
4381959	4384302	I watched X-Factor one time.
4384703	4387426	The first night it was on, and I haven't looked back.
4390050	4390871	I think it's catchy.
4391011	4391972	She has great producers.
4392413	4393975	But, whatever.
4395669	4397850	Something That I Want, and Love Me.
4397910	4399811	I don't know any of those songs.
4399991	4401491	They have 40 plus fun songs in there.
4401752	4402592	That's all you need.
4402612	4403873	That's kids stuff.
4405233	4407955	Centipede Infestation on the Wii and 3DS.
4407975	4411376	This is Atari's trying to reboot the Centipede franchise.
4411937	4412437	Good luck with that.
4413367	4416149	Photo World on the Nintendo DS.
4416489	4421112	This is a game that is going to be, I guess, using the DSi.
4422832	4426635	It's basically a game for taking photos and editing photos or something like that.
4427455	4428275	That sounds terrible.
4429136	4431577	Nikolai's Pencil Puzzle 3D for the 3DS.
4431617	4434139	The first puzzle game, I think, for the 3DS.

4522210	4523751	Yeah, they made a movie out of that, didn't they?
4525312	4525992	Yes, they did.
4526692	4527013	Okay.
4527173	4532175	Because they're done with Shrek and they need to, you know... Antonio Banderas needs to eat.
4534385	4552635	That is on Xbox 360, Playstation 3, DS, Wii, and I think 3DS Disney Universe, this is supposed to be like Kingdom Hearts, sort of, kind of, not really I'm curious about Disney Universe, I gotta admit Because everybody was like, Rob, you'd be so into this game And I haven't heard a lot about it
4553135	4554516	Which is usually a bad sign.
4554616	4557397	It reminds me of a Ratchet and Clank type game.
4558738	4560399	Of course, you get to wear different costumes.
4560419	4562060	You can get abilities from those costumes.
4562860	4564721	It's on 360, Wii, and PS3.
4565302	4567223	A House of the Dead Overkill.
4567303	4571505	If you hear things in the background, I'm looking at a little walkthrough of the game.
4571965	4576587	A House of the Dead Overkill extended cut on PlayStation 3 with even more swearing.
4577808	4578628	Sorry, I don't want to hear that.
4578748	4581870	I was going to play the audio, but it's just some douchebag talking over the gameplay.
4582270	4583851	It looks neat.
4584111	4585831	It looks like LittleBigPlanet.
4587092	4590853	I think I remember somebody saying something about a LittleBigPlanet-ish Disney game.
4590973	4595855	Yeah, they look like the LittleBigPlanet sack boys, but it's obviously not that.
4596636	4597656	I mean, it looks alright.
4597676	4598236	It might be kind of fun.
4598276	4598857	I might check that out.
4598877	4600117	Definitely a good kids game.
4600137	4602158	What do you mean kids game?
4602598	4604379	I love Disney.
4604479	4604859	You hush.

4654510	4655711	I've got to see what Muv Love is.
4655811	4656351	Muff Love?
4656411	4657692	I don't want to see the peripheral for that.
4657732	4659414	No, it's not Muff Love.
4659434	4660255	I think it's an anime.
4660275	4661916	I think it's based off an anime.
4663514	4664875	That is an awesome name for a game
4681161	4681962	Don't push your luck.
4682242	4687185	Just because we're getting bungee ferret tossing, don't push your luck on big titty cyberbots.

4749865	4752866	Ragnarok, Hikari, Toyami, No Kujo.
4753506	4757287	Yes, I believe this is another Ragnarok Online-based game.
4757307	4758207	That's what it looks like to me.
4758587	4761028	So, DarkSakura, sadly not here to squee.
4761768	4763689	SalaciousPop, are you going to squee on behalf of DarkSakura?
4763709	4763869	Eee!
4764890	4765290	Thank you.
4766051	4770476	Senritsu Nostratus comes out on the PSP this week as well in Japan.
4771057	4784492	And lastly, going over to the Wii and the 3DS, Kirby's Return to Dreamland on the Wii this week and on the 3DS, Yugen Gaisha Brave Company comes out this week on the 3DS.

4837660	4863774	Dragon Ball Z Ultimate Tenkachi on the 360 and PlayStation 3 Football Manager Handheld 2012 for the PSP House of the Dead Extended Cut for the PS3 James Noir's Hollywood Crimes for the 3DS Kinect Sports Season 2 for the 360 Motion Sports Adrenaline for the PS3 and 360 and finally NCIS for the Wii 360, PS3, 3DS, and PC
4867216	4894684	Woo Alright And there's a whole bunch of other stuff listed under Generically October 2011 And I'm not going to read off all that stuff Yeah, there's a lot Alright, let's move on Just a couple more stories for you guys And then the classic game of the week Yes, DarkSakura has given her blessing That we could do a game this week without her And we've got a good one tonight Meanwhile, a couple quick news stories Loki Hey, remember a few months back Several months back
4895267	4896769	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4911190	4913492	There is a new jailbreak that's out now.
4913632	4923562	It apparently is for the firmware version 3.55 consoles and supports games up to the current firmware 3.73.
4924143	4926185	So you're able to patch the games and play them on those consoles.
4926625	4942273	Apparently the dongle will allow you to play titles burned to Blu-ray discs via hard drive, including FIFA 12, Driver San Francisco, God of War Origins Collection, Pro Evo 2012, X-Men Destiny, and Sniper Ghost Warrior.
4943054	4945815	And it's circulating in Indonesia right now.
4945855	4947516	It'll be sold for roughly $45.
4950117	4951938	And they have a little video showing it.
4951958	4955100	It kind of boots up to a developer screen and stuff like that.
4955720	4958204	So obviously, what's that mean for everybody else?
4958344	4964332	Well, it means a lot more patches and a lot more firmware updates, of course, as they try to block this thing.
4964412	4966895	So look forward to that.
4967115	4968958	And hopefully the network doesn't go down again.
4972241	4995793	like I've said before I think crypto hackers that are really into DRM and stuff they may not even care about games that much they just love the challenge of breaking really good crypto and then they put it out and make money off of it so you know who knows but it's just gonna you know it's like plugging your thumb into a dam with all these holes in it trying to keep the water out you can only do it for so long
4998985	4999365	All right.
5000105	5002246	Well, moving on to another story for you guys.
5002286	5003326	This is actually a pretty big one.
5003346	5005967	Nintendo had a press conference in the middle of the night.
5006047	5013668	Well, okay, it was day during Japan, but it was the middle of the night for us about the 3DS and just detailing a ton and ton of new updates coming for the 3DS.
5014229	5017789	It's all around one big firmware update coming this November.
5018129	5020130	I don't think we had a specific date on this, right?
5020690	5021790	Of course not, so they can delay it.
5022070	5024951	Right, so it can be the very last day of November and it'd still be on time.
5025591	5026832	Some of the features that are going to be in this.
5027452	5029352	3D video recording, which they've said before.
5029872	5033234	You're going to be able to make clips up to 10 minutes long.
5033574	5037415	What also is part of this, which I gotta admit is kind of cool, stop motion animation.
5037835	5038935	Part of the 3D videos.
5039215	5039656	That's neat.
5041116	5044617	I mean, it's easy, but you know people are going to get creative with this.
5044697	5045177	It'll be fun.
5046338	5050679	It's a neat idea, but the cameras are just really terrible.
5051400	5071010	But that's alright, they'll fix that in the next version of the 3DS There will be a map overlay to show where Miis you got in StreetPass are from Does that mean you'll literally be able to see I got 100 people Well Rob, it'll be nice to know where you live Well yeah, but when you specify where you live on the 3DS They don't have GPS in them, you just say California
5071790	5082623	You know, it'll be interesting, because I get a lot of street passes at Disneyland when I go, and I get a lot of people from Mexico, and I get a lot of people, of course, in California, but I get all around the U.S., because, of course, Disneyland is a place for everybody around the world.
5082983	5089631	I have a shit ton of memes from Japan, thanks to that day we were at E3, and I street passed, like, 50 people in, like, five minutes.
5090232	5090952	So, eh.
5091973	5106560	you will be able to transfer software to other 3DS systems which is good because if the inevitable Game Boy Advance games come out and then you've got the inevitable 3DS upgrade that will happen next year so of course you're going to get suckered into buying the new 3DS you won't lose any of the shit you got on the current DS
5106946	5107487	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5123557	5131663	You've got a shitload of people on that from your trips to Disneyland, and you still only have... No, I've beat Find Me once, and I'm on the second go-through right now.
5131683	5132904	I'm about halfway through go-through number two.
5132924	5133584	Do you get more hats?
5134085	5134765	You do, actually.
5135145	5138448	You've encountered people with these awesome-looking Metroid hats and all this stuff.
5138468	5140629	They must have beat the game several times to get that.
5140689	5142851	No, I have the Metroid hat and I have the crown.
5142991	5146393	I don't have that demon hat that is changed color.
5146413	5147414	I think that's what you get...
5147694	5152456	Time 2, because that's the last boss in Find Me, so I'm thinking it's what you get on the second playthrough when you beat it.
5153216	5157918	And I am one puzzle piece away from having every single puzzle piece in the puzzle exchange game.
5158738	5160418	So, I'll have that soon too.
5162319	5166320	Does finding every puzzle piece make your 3DS spawn another analog stick?
5167401	5168081	Don't think so.
5168201	5170422	You just get pretty 3D pictures to rotate around.
5170842	5173263	And the one last one I need is those stupid Pikmin.
5175724	5179486	Also, I guess there's supposed to be another new StreetPass game that's not just Find Me.
5179867	5182208	So I guess they're adding more for the StreetPass stuff, which is cool.
5182949	5185650	A few more details on Mario Kart 7 came out.
5186311	5190353	You will be able to do a player online at 60 frames a second.
5190393	5191734	That's pretty impressive if true.
5192174	5192875	So that'll be cool.
5192915	5194996	You can do online or offline racing.
5195436	5201200	You will be able to set up communities so you can have groups of people to race against and have criteria for these communities.
5201260	5201780	That's kind of cool.
5202060	5205663	If there's an OLR community way to do that, we will build one, absolutely.
5206965	5213711	You're going to be able to get data from other people by using StreetPass, which will be win-loss records, coin data, and ghost data.
5213811	5215673	So that's kind of cool because that's in Ridge Racer right now.
5215693	5217835	So that would be cool to have that in Mario Kart.
5218217	5221501	Also announced, Lakitu and Metal Mario as characters.
5221561	5223003	They're really stretching now, aren't they?
5224364	5227508	Hulu Plus will be coming to the 3DS and the Wii.
5227768	5232974	Mario Kart, you know, you can put characters from your other franchises in there.
5232994	5236638	I mean, you don't just have to do Mario and Donkey Kong.
5237199	5238660	Donkey Kong's not part of... I mean...
5239441	5246826	Yeah, I know he was in the first Donkey Kong game, but the new Donkey Kong Country crap is not part of the Mario series.
5247106	5248407	It's its own thing.
5248587	5254791	So you can put Zelda and Samus and stuff like that.
5255211	5257533	There's a lot more characters to use other than Metal Mario.
5258840	5259340	That's true.
5259400	5261001	They could be put... Yeah, they could cross over.
5261081	5262762	Or just Pac-Man and Ms.
5262802	5264102	Pac-Man are in the arcade one.
5264122	5267104	I mean, I know the arcade one's made by Namco, but still, you've got that agreement.
5267904	5270225	Although... Or, you know, some of the Smash Bros.
5270265	5274507	characters, like, you know, some of the F-Zero characters... Kid Icarus and his car can fly.
5275707	5276247	Hulu Plus Hulu Plus
5300894	5304297	If, hypothetically, if we were paying for Hulu Plus, would you be down with that?
5304897	5309221	The Netflix client on the 3DS, in my opinion, is really bad and laggy and awful.
5309741	5312324	And it times out all the time and it's not wireless.
5312604	5316367	So I would need the Hulu Plus client to be better than that.
5316707	5317027	Interesting.
5317047	5318348	I didn't even realize it was that crappy.
5318708	5323071	What's important to note, though, is that while you might go, meh, or LOL, they're still supporting the Wii.
5323591	5329014	Netflix, the Wii is the number one for Netflix, which surprised the hell out of me, but they're in enough homes where, yeah.
5329074	5331015	Well, look at the sales data of how many Wiis were sold.
5331035	5332356	It's not that much of a stretch.
5332476	5334217	So that's going to be big for them to get Hulu Plus.
5335178	5343385	I think this is kind of neat more so than almost anything else is that the 3DS is going to be getting a messaging system called Nintendo Letterbox.
5343886	5347729	You will be able to send notes and photos and sounds to friends.
5348029	5355056	I mean granted you can kind of do this with what's called a cell phone with SMS and so forth but it opens it up to younger folks if
5355556	5385045	they had it on the Wii where you can send messages and photos but your Wii didn't really have a camera built in so like I could take 3D pictures of Disneyland and send it to my friends and make them jealous that'll be kind of cool so I don't know I think it's neat I'm not like oh my god it's the most amazing technology ever to happen but it seems like one of those things where it's like wow Nintendo's finally starting to like catch up with online and starting to implement features that we were seeing in other systems like five years ago but at least it's forward movement good job
5387475	5416334	so lots of stuff coming out for the 3DS in November maybe even sooner for some of this other stuff so we'll see alright meanwhile it is time to open up the gaming vault and take a trip in and find a classic video game of the week now DarkSakura is not here tonight but she left a key to her house and she left the vault unlocked so we made SalaciousPop go into the vault and find a game that he thinks you should be playing this week so that we wouldn't get in trouble
5417202	5422267	SalaciousPop, what did you find in DarkSakura's vault that is worthy of being the classic game of the week?
5422507	5430294	One of the first and one of the best Zelda, original Legend of Zelda clones for the NES, a little SNK RPG known as Crystallis.
5431355	5431835	Good pick.
5431976	5432616	Very good pick.
5433017	5434298	I was really surprised, DarkSakura.
5434318	5437661	I'd never done this one because this seems like one of those things that's obvious to me.
5440183	5446668	Crystallis was released in Japan April 13th of 1990 and came out in the U.S.
5446808	5451851	translated for the NES three months later in July of 90.
5453192	5462619	It was praised for the original 8-bit NES, relatively advanced graphics, very beautiful game, and also its fantastic graphics.
5462759	5463299	Soundtrack.
5464059	5470002	And I usually would just forget who actually made Crystalis.
5470042	5476724	I was thinking it was maybe one of Enix's first RPGs, but no, it was SNK as of a King of Fighters fame.
5477404	5485807	This is an RPG they put out, and I'm sure they've had titles in Japan that may not have made it over here, but I can't think of any other SNK RPGs.
5487338	5487638	Can you?
5490159	5490859	Not really.
5490979	5492220	No, I can't, actually.
5492620	5497422	So, yeah, this is kind of just a weird sort of anomaly, but it was a fantastic game.
5498823	5507526	The title in Japan was God Slayer Haruka Tenku no Sonata, which is God Slayer Sonata of the Faraway Sky.
5508467	5509767	And the plot is that...
5512348	5518575	Basically, humanity built this huge, powerful tower for whatever nefarious reason.
5518635	5528144	Technology got out of control, and once this tower was built up in the sky, there was some big apocalypse, and now the world is overrun with monsters.
5529746	5550026	you wake up in a very sort of futuristic sci-fi hibernation chamber where there's like a big glass door that slides open and you come out and you have amnesia and you don't know what's going on or who you are and you find sort of a little old RPG town and they're like you came out of that cave and
5550206	5551127	And oh my god.
5551527	5553288	So you have to figure out who you are.
5554009	5559813	And these four sages basically say that this evil dude is trying to get into the tower.
5559973	5566337	The Dragonia Empire is trying to get into the tower so they can go blow up the world again.
5567197	5570540	And you have to find these four swords, Earth, Fire, Wind, Water.
5571180	5573962	And you have to combine them to form Crystallis.
5574702	5579185	And then only then, once you have that legendary sword, you can then take out the evil dude.
5580426	5589870	Thinking that sounds kind of Zelda-ish, at least Link to the Past and so on, then you'd probably be right, that the plot lines are sort of similar.
5591390	5601534	The water sword you could use if you swung it, you could make little ice bridges over narrow little streams of water, so there were some puzzle-solving elements too on which sword you used.
5602234	5613679	You also had XP, so you would gain levels and your stats would go up and it was possible if you wanted to to grind and min-max your way all the way up to level 99 stats with everything.
5617456	5628764	It had some kind of janky collision detection, where you would try to avoid a monster and you would still hit it anyway, or trying to navigate some of the lava and the paths were kind of weird.
5628904	5636590	I know that it suffered from... You know like in Mega Man games when there were too many sprites, it would get kind of stuttery?
5637831	5638992	Crystallis had a lot of that.
5639432	5642394	But otherwise it was a very solid action RPG that was...
5644096	5645897	Final Fantasy Legend of Zelda Legend of Zelda
5659691	5667995	Ken Su and Athena from the magical girl pop star from King of Fighters and Sai Ken Su.
5669175	5672016	Two of the elders are analogs of them.
5672257	5677539	So that was kind of some meta fan service even back then in 1990 that they had done for their previous franchise.
5677559	5681020	And I believe this is before King of Fighters was a thing.
5681321	5681020	1990.
5681741	5683281	Fatal Fury, I believe, was out by then.
5684162	5688144	And the Athena, the platformer with Sai and Athena in it.
5688184	5688364	But...
5689244	5691006	I was going to say, wasn't that also an NES game?
5691046	5692287	Like way, way, way early on?
5692407	5702777	Yeah, so those characters were already established and they did fan service-y things with Kensou and Athena and Crystallis Yeah, I remember seeing that in Crystallis and I was like, is that tied to the other game?
5702817	5704078	So yeah, kind of funny
5704338	5730188	and there's a female character who you find who seems to have all of her memories and you can tell by looking at her character model or her sprite that she's obviously from the same time as you and she was hibernated in the past and awoke in the future just like you were and she kind of plays a role like Sheik in Ocarina of Time where she sort of shows up and gives some expositive narrative and helps you and then disappears again.
5731148	5737770	and it turns out that both you and her are scientists that willfully froze yourself so that you could reawaken.
5738070	5738610	Spoiler!
5738870	5739170	Yeah.
5739570	5741051	And help save the world.
5742811	5743772	This is a kick-ass game.
5743912	5744952	This is a great game.
5745352	5748493	I mean, graphical problems aside, it was just so good.
5748853	5756075	I remember it used to make my friend really sad because his birthday was October 1st and when you boot up this game it goes October 1st, 1997, the end day.
5756595	5757575	That's my birthday!
5758856	5759516	That's awesome.
5760516	5761617	Oh yeah, I remember that.
5761637	5765758	It had that little in-game or cinematic thing.
5765778	5766579	Which we survived.
5766799	5768640	We got past the end day and then some.
5770060	5783806	And there are a lot of similarities with the plot and the overall styling and art direction of the game that makes people think that it was influenced in part by Miyazaki's Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind.
5784727	5787208	The floating tower and a lot of the themes are similar.
5790436	5802843	and the first village that you find when you wake up from the cave is called Leaf, which I believe there is a village in Nausicaa that was named the same thing.
5804123	5806065	Or it could just be that Leaf is kind of a common term.
5809346	5813208	Some of the bosses, I don't know if this is a glitch, but basically...
5814509	5820476	If you just spammed the shit out of your sword attack button, you could kind of kill bosses by just, you know, button mashing.
5821717	5833711	I see here that a lot of people had problems with that when there was supposed to be some sort of more styled way on what weapons you use on a boss, but you kind of could ignore that and just find its weak spot and beat the hell out of it.
5833991	5834732	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5852210	5854351	Alright, we are going to take a break, guys, but don't go anywhere.
5854371	5866959	We're going to come back with plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio, including some rapid-fire news, some early talk about Xbox and next Xbox and PlayStation 4, and can you believe we haven't brought this game up yet tonight?
5866999	5868240	It's all people have been talking about all week.
5868380	5870881	Arkham City, we've got to talk about some things with that.
5871181	5877285	The Mailbag, the FUs of the Week, the Twitter topics, and your calls when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5883357	5885940	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.
5885980	5891926	We are live tonight with the 433rd episode of our show for this October the 23rd of 2011.
5893588	5898393	DarkSakura not here tonight sadly but taking her place and doing a mighty fine job so far.
5898533	5902678	Salacious Pop with a good classic game of the week by the way.
5902798	5903298	Very good job.
5903459	5903759	Thank you.
5904179	5909201	One of the games that came up in the last segment that I was reading a little more about during the break, because I was just curious about this, Disney Universe.
5910081	5913342	It really does look like it's going to be just like LittleBigPlanet.
5913442	5914983	It doesn't even try to hide it.
5915363	5920705	But they say, I'm looking up the wiki on it, and they're saying, well, it also kind of looks like the Lego games, I guess.
5921185	5925527	But you play through six different worlds to beat enemies, get power-ups, and coins.
5926087	5931749	And I guess you can put on costumes resembling characters from 40 classic and contemporary Disney and Pixar properties.
5932449	5934831	And of course, the first thing I said is, is there Tron?
5935011	5935492	Is there Tron?
5935532	5935992	Is there Tron?
5936032	5936633	Is there Tron?
5936853	5937274	There's Tron.
5937394	5939235	Tron Legacy is one of them.
5939476	5941638	Sadly, I don't think that's one of the worlds you'll get to fight in.
5941678	5942979	That would make me very sad.
5943379	5944460	Maybe downloadable later.
5944700	5946422	But I love that there's like Wall-E and stuff too.
5946562	5946862	I don't know.
5946882	5947423	I might, I might.
5947543	5948604	I might have to check this out.
5949144	5953646	I'm kind of a sucker for Disney stuff, and LittleBigPlanet obviously is a great game, so we'll see.
5953666	5955947	Of course, this is probably a $60 game, huh?
5955967	5956347	I don't know.
5957208	5957328	No.
5957628	5958088	Oh, it's not?
5958528	5959269	I think like $50.
5960069	5960770	Oh, well, gee.
5961030	5961870	Such a value.
5962350	5963451	It's a bargain basement.
5964111	5964491	Oh, boy.
5965072	5973556	All right, let's go around and do some rapid-fire news, because, you know, sometimes there's a lot of news, and we don't have a lot of time to go too in-depth, but we want to just make sure we cover a few things here.
5974556	5977998	Sony's 3D display will be coming out November 13th.
5978038	5983860	Of course, it's $499, and it comes with, you know, Motor Store Apocalypse.
5984861	5989063	Unfortunately, there was Resistance 3, unlike promised before, but, you know, whatever.
5990304	5995987	Also, of course, a pair of glasses and an HDMI cable that you'll need to use that with your PlayStation 3.
5997508	6003252	And you can also buy separate sets of glasses for $70 as well.
6003492	6006054	And there are games supporting it so far.
6006814	6015300	Motorstorm Apocalypse, Gran Turismo 5, Killzone 3, and Super Stardust HD all support the simul view right now at launch.
6015660	6021882	and I believe I saw that Ridge Racer is supposed to be getting 3D support as well.
6021922	6022682	So that's kind of neat.
6023143	6027644	Because that's a game that would probably benefit from it quite a bit.
6027944	6032126	Of course people have been begging and pleading Valve, when are you going to release some...
6034047	6040412	and stuff I can buy for Portal, like actual Portal turrets and cubes and whatnot.
6040872	6044435	Well, you will be able to buy a Portal turret very soon.
6045096	6048779	It's going to be plush, which is fine.
6049019	6050340	That's close enough, I guess.
6050761	6057887	It does have a glowing red eye with a motion detector and will, of course, spout different phrases from the game.
6058987	6065749	and they will be going on sale mid-December on ThinkGeek is where you can purchase those.
6066509	6071831	Of course, also to go along with that will be the official Portal Companion Cube.
6071851	6074192	I thought they already had a cuddly Companion Cube.
6074292	6078693	I think a lot of those have been like people made them on... Is that like an Etsy rip-off?
6078713	6079053	Well, no.
6079473	6084435	Weren't they the official... They were like dice for your rear-view mirror in your car.
6084495	6085255	Okay, maybe it was that.
6085275	6086095	Companion Cube dice.
6086175	6105210	this one is uh it's not huge it's like six inches cubed obviously and um it'll be available uh via the NECA shop um in November please don't throw them in the fireplace I guess um that'll be yeah coming out so um
6107054	6107814	Neat, I guess.
6108175	6113058	Like I said, I preferred that the portal turret wasn't exactly a plush item.
6113118	6114899	It kind of looks stupid when it's plush.
6116019	6120502	I'd rather a plastic thing that I can shoot bullets out of.
6122683	6123804	I don't know.
6123964	6136394	And then, of course, to go along with Portal, there's some discussion regarding the second DLC expansion, which will be coming early next year, or late next year, depending if it gets delayed.
6137234	6140317	And it will include an in-game editor.
6140417	6148223	You may remember they were talking about something before, saying, wouldn't it be kind of cool if we could create some sort of like, almost like a Photoshop for...
6148783	6154509	Portal level editing that you can very easily create your own levels.
6154529	6155150	They're going to do that.
6155370	6165081	Also, they're going to allow some additional view, play, vote on various levels that are going to be included in this.
6165781	6169405	One of the things that they're going to be adding is the ability to actually play
6170206	6170546	DarkSakura.com
6184386	6185546	360 doesn't have Steam.
6186267	6192088	Wasn't Valve supposed to have some big announcement after Portal 2 came out on what their next project is?
6192128	6194309	Because as I understand it, we don't really know.
6194449	6195149	Defense of the Agents.
6195189	6195569	Isn't it Dota?
6195729	6196229	Oh, that's right.
6196309	6196669	Okay.
6197489	6199970	Because I was thinking, what is their next big thing that they're working on?
6199990	6201130	It's certainly not Half-Life.
6201170	6202171	Don't get me started.
6202351	6204991	I mean, because they've already, you've seen, there's clips of that on YouTube.
6205031	6208412	Like people are already playing it at, I guess, conventions or some type of thing.
6208992	6210753	But then after that, who knows?
6213148	6215872	Sorry, SalaciousPop, I don't think it'll be Half-Life 3, but we'll see.
6215892	6216293	You never know.
6216433	6216854	You never know.
6217595	6219398	Christmas may come early this year, SalaciousPop.
6219418	6219978	Have you been good?
6222941	6230344	I think if it's going to be anything, they're just going to update the whole source engine, just do something brand new, like Half-Life 3 engine or something.
6230744	6233646	That's what's probably taking it so long, is they're going to have to create a new engine for it.
6234766	6238748	KaiJudo in our chatroom at chat.orange.com says, I want portal PJs.
6239648	6243069	Would they be little companion cubes, or little blue and orange portals, or what?
6243810	6250513	I saw this girl that had these portal earrings I thought were really cute, where she had a blue portal on one ear and an orange one on the other, and a guy running through.
6250533	6251253	I thought it was cute.
6252454	6254576	There's a lot of cute little nerdy things out there.
6255637	6261103	Anyhow, moving on to some rumored, I guess holiday-related bundles coming to the PlayStation 3.
6261924	6264467	A Mayhem Edition Move Bundle.
6265243	6267445	Killzone 3, Resistance 3 Game of the Year Edition
6282999	6290622	as you remember I said I wouldn't buy it until the game of the year edition came out it's November is it cheaper?
6290762	6311191	it's the same price it's $59.99 but it has all the expansions and they're also doing a bundle that's going to have the move controller with it as well oh that's cool our last few trips to Target and Best Buy have been you going LittleBigPlanet 2 there it is and I don't know I don't think they're doing a game of the year so maybe I should pick it up this time you can just borrow mine
6312571	6313152	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6330370	6332631	If you have a Kinect, you probably already know what Dance Central is all about.
6332651	6336972	But if you want to check out the new engine, you can shake for free to Club Can't Handle Me.
6337092	6339013	That's the David Guetta song, right, with Florida.
6339533	6342474	And Bulletproof by LaRue.
6343974	6347015	Also, the rest of the songs for the game have been announced.
6347575	6350056	Among some of the highlights, or lowlights, if you will.
6351124	6367400	Justin Bieber with Somebody to Love, Lady Gaga with Bad Romance, Little Boots, Sean Kingston with Fire Burning, Tweet featuring Missy Elliott with Oops Oh My, a cover version of Toxic, and Willow with Whip My Hair.
6374591	6376433	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6397429	6401531	The website WhatTheyPlay.com has closed.
6401971	6407353	I didn't know IGN owned it, but yeah, IGN owned WhatTheyPlay.com, and it is no more.
6408153	6410714	On the Facebook page, I guess it was announced.
6410834	6413535	Well, no, because they didn't really announce it since February, so whatever.
6413936	6417897	I guess a closure notice went up or whatever, and now it just redirects to IGN.com.
6418297	6419218	Why this is funny?
6419538	6424860	You'll have to go check the Orange Lounge Radio wiki, but one of our very first dream games we ever came up with
6425200	6425761	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6446984	6471034	two guys kissing more offensive than a severed head so somehow that led to this whole discussion about whattheyplay.com snap be it what it may I don't even know what episode that was in but I'm sure it's all on the wiki the folks that update our wiki at orangeloungeradio.wikia.com they do a fantastic job archiving some of the shows and jokes it's great Salacious Pop, what do you have for us?
6472478	6474100	Rock Band 3 is getting some new songs.
6474781	6480589	Mostly Rob Zombie and White Zombie, his project before he started putting stuff out under his own name.
6481390	6485556	They're gonna be available October 25th for about $2 a song.
6485776	6487478	There are four of them in this update.
6488940	6503986	For those that remember The Darkness, that kind of retro, glam metal, sort of kitschy gimmick band that was popular a little while ago with that song, I Believe in a Thing Called Love, and the guy who's in the spandex jumpsuit, that song is a lot of fun.
6504927	6507248	I could see, you know, people getting drunk and playing rock band to that.
6508008	6535801	for Rob Zombie Living Dead Girl and then under the white zombie name Thunderciss65 which I seem to remember was a pretty badass song and white zombies Supercharger Heaven and also Supercharger Heaven is often referred to as Devilman because that's what's in the chorus I was going to ask where more human than human is but I'm like almost positive that's already in the game yeah Rockman has a lot of songs so very cool
6536945	6552014	In peripheral news, if you remember that, I think it was from Famitsu Magazine a couple weeks or months ago, the caddy for the 3DS that you pop it into and it has an extra right side analog thumbie thing.
6552574	6558298	And people were like, well, does this mean that the 3DS is going to get a new version that doesn't have this as an add-on?
6558498	6560119	It was always going to get a new version.
6560419	6560879	Well, yeah.
6561119	6562360	It's Nintendo after all.
6562944	6571952	So it was being bundled with Monster Hunter over in Japan, which is a huge, huge Capcom franchise over there.
6572052	6575755	I don't think it's nearly as popular over here, but we're getting it here in the US.
6576776	6582481	They're saying that it's early 2012, whether that's Q1 or Q2 is what Capcom is forecasting.
6585103	6591205	It will be available for the Resident Evil Revelations game which is due out February 7th of next year.
6591305	6593285	So obviously by February 7th we're going to get this thing.
6593845	6595506	Will a AAA battery be included?
6595746	6598227	Because that's what this thing runs off of apparently.
6598427	6600147	It doesn't know how to plug into your DS.
6600167	6603588	Well the battery life on the 3DS is already pretty bad.
6603789	6606990	Especially if you have something open and then you just close the clamshell for sleep mode.
6608130	6609690	Your DS will die within an hour.
6610311	6610411	Um
6611571	6629585	so my understanding is that for whether it be Resident Evil Revelations or Monster Hunter while it's nice to have this catty thing with the extra right thumb analog thing that is not mandatory so you can still play these games without the extra right side thing
6631626	6657532	and if you're thinking about getting a 3DS at this point you might want to wait because there's going to be I'm sure a redo next year that just has all this shit included unless you must play Mario Kart 7 or one of the other games that's coming out soon which I can't say I blame you I'm really excited about that Mario game to be honest so for those of us that were for the early adopters who thought that it was just a horrible nightmare and you were hallucinating no it's real it's real and we're getting it and that's what you get I'm kidding um
6659012	6670335	Finally, and I have maybe a little resentment that Rob gave me this story to report on, but Karaoke Revolution Glee Volume 3, it's the best show ever.
6670395	6672596	Oh my god, what's going to happen with Mercedes?
6673216	6676477	It's coming out on the Xbox 360 and Wii November 22nd.
6679558	6703819	haven't the ratings for that show really dipped though like people are kind of getting over it like I heard that other Fox show the Fox show with that that one girl who just looks surprised like she looks like a deer in the headlights all that what's her name Zoe Zoe Zoe Deschanel yes her her show is like beating Glee and it comes on like after it or something so like Glee is like it's it's fading fast it's one of those flash in the pan shows probably
6704315	6708538	Yeah, and of course, Konami is putting this out, obviously, because it's Karaoke Revolution.
6708759	6720388	And the Glee merchandise, I think, now is... And all the licensing and the Glee brand and all the CDs and the shit that they put out is a bigger... Probably, it's a bigger brand than the actual series.
6720888	6723650	All the crap that they're slapping the franchise onto.
6724011	6726152	How many Sue Silvesters are you going to see this Halloween?
6727013	6727914	And that's how Sue...
6728634	6744009	I have to admit she was the only funny thing on that show as much of a cartoon as that character is it's like the only reason to watch it I could care less about white kids with problems it was all about Sue Sylvester to me
6744457	6747019	So yeah, Glee, Karaoke Revolution, whoop the shit.
6747460	6748220	That's my last story.
6748541	6748941	Alright.
6749522	6753385	And by the way, that's like the only way Karaoke Revolution lives on right now.
6753445	6763955	I think that's the funniest thing out of all of it is that Karaoke Revolution... Remember when Harmonix co-did the first Karaoke Revolution game and it was like really this whole new thing?
6764375	6766237	This is what your series turned into.
6767238	6769800	Don't stop believing.
6773464	6776466	Hey, let's travel around and get some more news.
6776546	6778828	We are also going to be coming up to the mailbag very soon.
6778868	6782291	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us your emails.
6782831	6784913	And Twitter topics coming later as well.
6784933	6788796	It's your last chance to get those in at Twitter.com slash OLR.
6788896	6790818	So at OLR on Twitter.
6791438	6791998	All right, Loki.
6793572	6799074	Well, of course, everyone's always talking about what's going to be next for the Xbox and PlayStation.
6799614	6810138	Well, of course, the rumor is that the next Xbox system is going to be slated for 2013, and they're saying with Nintendo revealing its...
6810618	6818022	Wii U console at E3, you know, it's kind of pushed them to release their system faster.
6818122	6839814	And apparently the site, well, the site Develop is saying, there's sources saying that apparently they have a source from the processor chip manufacturers to middleware firms that they're expecting an E3 2013 reveal of the console, followed by a launch later in the year.
6842097	6843620	and it could be as far away as early 2014.
6847512	6849993	Which, that's almost a 10 year life cycle.
6850113	6852454	I mean, that's like 8, 9 years.
6852614	6855295	Yeah, I can't really get too fussy about 8 years.
6855355	6856296	That's a good run for me.
6856536	6861618	Yeah, I mean, what, the PlayStation 1 was out in 2... Well, the PlayStation 1 was what, 96, 95?
6861738	6862258	Yeah, I think 95.
6862298	6863599	That was when Toshin did it.
6863619	6864799	And then PlayStation 2 was 2001.
6864839	6865099	So that was... 2000.
6865139	6865239	2000, okay.
6865259	6865780	It was a 5 year.
6865880	6866800	And then to the PlayStation 2 was 2006.
6866860	6866940	Or...
6876204	6877066	God, I can't count.
6877106	6877887	PlayStation 3 was 2006.
6878948	6879910	So that was the sixth year.
6880331	6884097	So if this pushes, what, seven or eight, that's pretty good.
6884197	6888724	The hardware is finally plateauing to the point where you can have sustainable graphics for eight years.
6888744	6889545	That's great.
6889866	6890907	I would think, though, that the...
6891508	6892388	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6916018	6917239	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6937006	6962721	and it's not necessarily the end of the life cycle because they could still be considering doing their 10 year life cycle it can go it can co-exist there's still games coming out for the PS2 so it could co-exist with it for a few years after I wouldn't be surprised to be able to push over 10 years so that's interesting well that's the theory at least so I guess we'll have to wait and see only a couple years away before an announcement
6963843	6966464	I would imagine we'd get an announcement sooner than later anyways
6979808	6984553	I was going to say, because usually the console that came out first was the one that fell on its ass.
6984673	6989939	Because we're all looking at the Wii U going, you know, maybe Lightning's not going to strike twice this time.
6989959	6991500	I think that's why.
6991801	6992822	You know what?
6993763	7001190	Seriously, the Wii U, I'm kind of disappointed with the fact that they aren't going to try to up the graphics to, yeah, okay, it's slightly better than 360.
7003753	7009157	Well, it's going to have to be slightly better than that because the 360 is going to be done with by the time that it comes out.
7009798	7017123	Yeah, so if it's a good system, Microsoft can have a year head start on everyone and win ultimately the market.
7017512	7022854	I mean, Nintendo will have a chance, though, at next year's E3 to really wow the shit out of us.
7022894	7026915	I mean, the nice thing about where Nintendo's going, they get a second chance.
7027495	7034858	So next year, if they can do it, they can put out games that have fucking sweet graphics that use this whole tablet thing that just blow our fucking mind.
7034898	7035818	Like, they have a chance.
7035958	7037079	I've got a prediction for you.
7038099	7039659	It's not gonna be ready for next year.
7040420	7041220	It's not gonna be ready.
7041420	7041800	You think?
7041840	7043302	You're calling a Wii U delay already?
7043342	7045003	Wii U is not coming out in 2012.
7045504	7045964	You think?
7046605	7048427	And do you think it's because of its cold reception?
7048447	7049728	I think it's because they got nothing.
7049848	7050809	They have nothing.
7051089	7052911	They have a bunch of tech demos and that's it.
7052931	7054112	Proof of concept, that's it.
7054152	7054873	Here's the problem.
7055253	7060638	If the 3DS doesn't make a recovery this holiday, and I don't know, I still think it's too early to say.
7060798	7065343	I think the Mario Kart and the Mario games are going to go a long way in putting these things under kids' Christmas trees this year.
7065963	7071285	But if the 3DS doesn't gain a lot of steam quickly, what are they going to have next year?
7072245	7072565	Nothing.
7075086	7081367	It's going to really put pressure on to get the Wii U out or they're going to have to give in to investors and start making iPhone games.
7081447	7082928	Yeah, but that's the thing.
7082988	7087009	If they're going to rush the Wii U, come on.
7087709	7093391	We're going to see these games that, oh, we were developing this for the Wii, but we decided to put it on the Wii type situation.
7094751	7094871	Yeah.
7096234	7097034	Like the last story.
7097334	7103718	Nintendo has been the more family-friendly, affordable model since, really, the N64.
7104279	7107461	I don't like the fact that the tablet controller is a terminal.
7107521	7109042	It doesn't have any processor in it.
7109242	7109862	It's simply a...
7111343	7117125	I think Sprinto needs to realize that people are fucking buying iPads for their goddamn kids and iPads aren't fucking cheap.
7117525	7120586	You can make your console more expensive and people will still buy it.
7121047	7122367	They're not going to go, oh my god.
7122587	7123688	Don't give them too many ideas.
7123808	7132871	Well, I understand that, but I'm just saying, you know, if you're buying a fucking $200 piece of equipment for your child, I mean, shit.
7133471	7134892	I think they will spend $300 on a console.
7136637	7139661	Brad from PodCulture is in our chatroom and wants me to make a bet with Loki.
7141364	7142265	Stop it.
7142826	7143727	Stop it, okay?
7144288	7146470	You had your chance, and you blew it.
7147272	7149454	All you had to do was generate a few sales...
7150998	7157002	A few hundred thousand sales of Eye of Judgment, and that was it.
7157122	7157982	And then you would have had it.
7158122	7166387	But, see, the Wii U does sound ridiculous, but... Once again, it's something like, all these developers are so excited.
7166667	7174212	I think that these developers seriously don't get enough sun, because it's... Oh, wow, it's a tablet that interacts... Do you think they all have vitamin D deficiencies?
7174432	7176854	It's like it's a tablet that interacts with this console.
7177814	7181456	Dude, they've got like... And the tablet does shit by itself.
7181496	7182957	You need the console tethered to it.
7184477	7185418	But you know what, though?
7185738	7191021	It's not... You say that like it's a bad thing, but look at the on-live stuff.
7191861	7197524	It's a console that interacts with a server that basically streams the gaming to it.
7198064	7198344	True.
7198464	7199385	That's the same thing.
7200085	7201526	But once again, I'm like...
7203078	7204359	That tablet looks stupid.
7204940	7209424	And yeah, oh goody, we can put my, you know, my inventory down on this.
7209485	7213248	You know what, you could do that also with the DS or something.
7213328	7216592	You can have it where it interacts with the actual consoles.
7216612	7218153	You know, the DS could do that.
7218654	7219975	Same with the 3DS could do that.
7220375	7222097	But they didn't fucking do that.
7224039	7224840	I don't know, it's just...
7226820	7228362	They're gonna need a lot more than what they've got
7242382	7258244	and it did look pretty fucking sweet I gotta say and like you know I like Batman I don't know why I didn't buy this game at launch but I guess I'm just not I'm not usually very good at the 3D action games I think that's kind of part of it but there's a part of me that's going kind of want with this game
7258965	7262886	But then I read this crap and I go, maybe I shouldn't buy it right away.
7263646	7268367	Remember how we've been talking about Project $10 applies to this game and it's not even multiplayer.
7268767	7269908	No, they've done the Catwoman.
7269968	7271468	Well, they have to run the servers.
7271868	7274109	You understand, they have to run the servers.
7274449	7275609	Think of the servers.
7275669	7284311	You know what really, the only thing that ticks me off about the whole thing is that they really made Catwoman sound like she was an integral part of the game and like it's all part of it.
7284331	7286472	And now it's DLC, you know, essentially.
7286912	7287833	PAY TO UNLOCK CONTENT
7302609	7308331	No, I don't, I don't, I think it's like a, uh, I was listening to Bobby's show earlier, and one of his callers said that it was a 200 megabyte download.
7308531	7308771	Really?
7308951	7309091	Yeah.
7309972	7310772	So it must come with other stuff.
7310792	7311052	Alright.
7312073	7313873	Do some investigative reporting, Loki.
7314253	7315534	Meanwhile, okay, here's the deal.
7316294	7319795	The thing that kind of, you know, ticked me off and made me go, maybe I shouldn't have rushed into this.
7320216	7323917	Apparently, those download codes are showing up, and they don't work.
7324017	7326418	Some of them don't work, some of them are just fucking blank.
7326778	7352737	and there's a picture circulating around the internet of cards that went into boxes with no codes on them and actually from a factory production standpoint this makes a lot of sense they probably have an assembly line and a machine that picks up these cards and runs them through a printer and the machine probably if it picks up two at a time on accident which is bound to happen why this ever can't happen to me at the ATM machine I don't know but in the factory it picks up two at a time and then one of them doesn't get a code yet still goes in the game
7353417	7359326	So, yeah, so it was going out there and these people that were looking forward to playing as Catwoman were kind of screwed.
7359667	7364014	However, Warner does have a five-step process to get this fixed.
7364214	7365135	All right, fair enough.
7365176	7366718	It was a couple hundred meg download.
7366738	7367880	All right, so be it.
7368243	7377308	All right, so apparently you call customer service and you give them a dated proof of purchase, like a receipt, that shows a new copy of the game, not eBay or not rented.
7377668	7380730	You have to give your gamer tag for Xbox Live or PSN.
7381090	7388494	You have to give your email address, a scan or digital picture of the package and game disc, and a scan or digital picture of the code sheet.
7388835	7390816	Once you send all that in, they'll give you the code.
7391056	7393077	That's a lot of work for their mistake.
7393637	7394338	I know, right?
7395018	7397240	I seem to recall last time a developer fucked up.
7397280	7399381	Wasn't it Deus Ex that had this problem?
7399481	7405025	One of those had a code, and it got fucked up, so they just ended up having to give it to everybody.
7405065	7405626	It was Driver.
7405806	7406326	It was Driver.
7406346	7406666	It was Driver.
7406726	7410569	Driver, they forgot to put the code in one of the packages.
7410649	7412290	I think it was 360 or PS3.
7412330	7414172	I can't remember what was one of those two.
7415092	7417514	They forgot to put in the Uplay code.
7419835	7427720	But this is apparently like people, this is going back to the days of when people would call in sick to work and stay up all night to play a video game.
7427740	7429801	Like this game is having that effect on people.
7430301	7435925	Like people that I know that aren't even that into video games are just going apeshit crazy over this.
7436305	7444550	And trust me people, I mean if you really want to get this free code and you maybe have purchased a used copy already, I mean come on.
7444890	7447711	You need a picture of the pack shot and a receipt.
7448892	7451253	I think we can find one on Google Image Search.
7452333	7453053	I love this.
7453694	7463097	Tigerclaw linked a picture in chatroom of a midnight launch at his local Evil G, and one of the employees is dressed up as the Joker with the Why So Serious makeup.
7463737	7464957	At least people are getting into it.
7466218	7466478	Lol.
7468337	7470458	Shame on you for giving that place your business.
7470838	7471678	I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
7471758	7475719	This is where I'm going to get in my sandbox once again about this whole code crap.
7476239	7489382	So I would like to pose this question, and I'm sure no developers of these types of games actually listen to this show, but maybe after we hopefully win the podcast awards, someone will go back in the archives and hear my rant.
7490791	7500636	So, I always hear the complaint, or I should say the argument from people in favor of these $10 codes and online passes and stuff.
7501056	7505598	Well, the developers don't get any money from used sales.
7505618	7510961	They just don't get any money, and those servers cost money to maintain, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
7511741	7515084	Okay, developers, how much of that $10 do you actually get?
7515304	7523910	Because I'm going to be willing to bet that you get nothing from those $10 vouchers that get redeemed or whatever.
7524451	7530676	I'm betting it's $0 is what you get, and it all goes to the publisher to pad their numbers.
7530736	7537681	And yeah, some of that I'm sure will go to running their servers because, hey, if you can run your servers cheaper than you are now, then why not?
7540086	7541186	I want to see the receipts.
7560715	7564782	I want someone to say, hey, we get a buck for each time someone buys this thing.
7565263	7567487	That's what I'd like to see, but I doubt it.
7568088	7570031	I doubt that they get very much money from that.
7571650	7571950	All right.
7572571	7574913	Let's move on to the mailbag.
7575074	7579378	Every week, you guys send us emails at mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.
7579758	7585464	Now, normally, DarkSakura will dive into the email bag headfirst and pull out some of her favorite emails to read on air.
7585964	7588587	However, as you guys are aware, she's not here tonight.
7589087	7594433	So she has asked Salacious Pop to put on the biohazard suit and jump in there on her behalf.
7594993	7597755	So, Salacious Pop, what's in the emails tonight?
7598075	7611285	First email tonight is from Robert M, and he writes, Evening, you probably already got feedback about this, but the free downloadable Zelda Four Swords is not a 3DS exclusive, but it's available on the DSi models as well.
7611885	7619210	I am very glad to see that they added a single player mode, allowing the player to have a second link follow him around and switch control to either character.
7619791	7622953	Overall, this is the kind of effort Nintendo should be putting into its re-releases.
7623985	7625005	Now on to toys!
7627667	7645114	I have had and not had an interest in Spyro since the Insomniac days, and while I sympathize with the storage issues and definitely the high buy-in, the concept of Skylander seems kind of cool, even though I'm sure the game itself would probably be fairly simplistic.
7645874	7654438	I've seen other game slash toys like this, although those were probably an in-package code rather than direct peripheral transfer of memory.
7655419	7661482	Some online racing games with toy cars, and some MMO called Freaky Creatures, whose action figures I've seen at Best Buy.
7662302	7664924	I haven't seen either of these in stores for a while, though.
7665665	7669128	I haven't seen as much integration with my Transformers action figures.
7669268	7677395	A line here and there may have a catalog with a code for an unlockable in one of the games, but these are rare and all the catalogs have the same code.
7677875	7681698	My question is, have you seen a more successful toy game integration?
7682899	7685179	Well, would you call those music games toys?
7685439	7688100	I mean, like the guitar, the plastic guitars, are those toys?
7688240	7690920	I mean, it kind of depends on your definition of toy.
7691261	7699762	Well, I think it's, what he's asking is, what was that card game for the Sony that bombed and never came out, Eye of Judgment?
7699782	7700502	Yeah, Eye of Judgment.
7700602	7704823	That's where you're kind of buying a physical thing to bring into the game.
7705563	7708924	With the Skylanders, you have to find these little action figures to play that character in the game.
7708984	7710964	So what have there been that's similar to that?
7711425	7718353	Well, you have to go from the disc generations forward, because obviously with the cartridge scenario, that just didn't happen.
7718793	7728324	I mean, I remember old school VCR games that tied in with toys, but that stuff didn't work very well, and it was all just for show in the commercials and stuff.
7729526	7730507	But as far as like...
7731548	7732769	toys with games.
7733590	7734130	I'm not sure.
7734210	7735231	Loki, can you think of anything?
7735291	7739874	Any type of, like, where they sold toys that integrated with the game, like this does?
7739974	7740875	That integrated the game?
7741035	7742036	Yeah.
7742096	7742676	Connectimals.
7742776	7754745	They had little scans where you can basically interact with different, you know, you can buy toys, or they had collector's editions that came with stuffed animals that you could play with the actual game with.
7754785	7756246	Viva Pinata had some...
7757915	7759119	Did Viva Pinata have that?
7759159	7761325	Yeah, they had a little thing where you could scan your...
7765191	7765892	They tried.
7766192	7767272	It wasn't going to happen.
7767293	7768073	Some people enjoyed it.
7768173	7768914	Some people really did.
7768934	7770335	But remember they had the cartoon?
7770515	7772116	They were really trying to make an empire out of that.
7772136	7783424	If you want to count Babysitting Mama, because Babysitting Mama had the doll that you shoved the Wii Remote up into its nether regions and would interact that way.
7783444	7785825	Don't worry, Mama will fix it.
7787006	7787987	Let's see, what else?
7788487	7791229	The chat room is yelling Captain Power.
7791269	7793851	I think that's what they're thinking of the VCR stuff I'm talking about.
7795499	7796320	Oh, wow.
7796340	7797761	Yeah, I remember that.
7797841	7799943	That was kind of like a rich kid's toy for me.
7799963	7801724	Well, that shit was cheap as hell, though.
7801844	7804206	I didn't ever own one, but, you know, I had the rich friends.
7804766	7807028	And so, you know, they did.
7810158	7811298	That's what you do when you're poor.
7811358	7812518	You make friends with rich people.
7814339	7815459	Through your sass and wit.
7816360	7816660	All right.
7819061	7820141	Salacious Pop, what's next?
7821702	7830125	Chiggers writes, asking OLR, or rather, asking DarkSakura, who's not here, an update on her PlayStation tester application.
7830465	7833087	I can actually give you that, even though DarkSakura's not here tonight.
7833827	7835188	She decided not to go through with it.
7835688	7840150	And it was a discussion between her and Dan about the whole, like, if I actually got it, I have to relocate.
7840811	7843112	Keep in mind, Dan just recently got employed again.
7843592	7847654	He was working a game crazy up until they all went under, and he's employed again.
7847714	7851356	So they made a personal decision that it's just not the right time for DarkSakura to do that.
7851797	7855739	As funny as it would have been, she has to think not just for herself.
7855999	7857640	You know, she has a husband, so they...
7858340	7859802	They didn't go through with it, which is too bad.
7861724	7864306	Unfortunately, Salacious Pop's application got in too late, right?
7864346	7864927	No, I'm just kidding.
7866528	7867109	Just messing.
7867910	7871914	I just want to see you go on that show and claw some 21-year-old's eyes out for being a bitch.
7873195	7874256	I'm probably too old.
7874316	7874917	I'm sure it's gone.
7874937	7877159	You'd be grandpa on that show.
7877399	7878761	There's usually one or two people in their 30s.
7879561	7880562	that are in the cast somehow.
7882463	7892969	They have one that I watched just because it was just the part of it because Freddie Wong is in it briefly.
7893130	7896752	He posted it on his Facebook page but it's like some Battlefield thing called The Controller.
7897072	7901975	It's a bunch of these noobs team up with these pro gamers and they have to play Battlefield 3.
7902535	7904376	It's basically a big advertisement for Battlefield 3.
7906278	7907799	But yeah, all those shows are dumb.
7912513	7914334	You can test games for the PlayStation 4!
7914374	7915255	And we'll kick in the nuts!
7926665	7951050	I don't know what happened to the second guy that won like I know a gay guy won the second season his handle was like gamer and I haven't heard a lot about what happened to him but I knew the guy that won the first season actually like he only tested for like six months and he moved into the part at Sony that he really wanted to do it was it's that whole thing was really about just getting your foot in the damn door but I'd be curious about did they hire anyone else from the shows you know how like sometimes like like American Idol
7951950	7953111	Chris Daughtry didn't win.
7953191	7954952	If you're in the top three, you're getting a record deal.
7955132	7956112	Exactly.
7959113	7960574	Next email is from Jamjay.
7961335	7964176	Jamjay writes... Holy shit, I haven't heard that name in forever.
7964196	7966097	That guy used to show up live a lot.
7966977	7968898	This week I picked up Rocksmith for the 360, a...
7978065	7986247	My thoughts on the game itself is that it is more of a training slash drill tool than game.
7987247	7995369	For many, this would be a turn-off, but as an extreme novice at guitar, I found it was decent and made otherwise boring practice a bit better.
7996089	8001571	The game functions as an amplifier for the guitar and has a free mode where you can just free play your guitar.
8002391	8009236	I would recommend Rocksmith for those that want to learn a bit of guitar but aren't taking formal lessons.
8010497	8015961	One of the drawbacks is that you have to grind songs repetitively in order to open up new modes.
8016322	8018443	However, it does make you practice.
8019684	8027610	After the 30 minutes of starting the game, I found I was able to play a simplified version of Satisfaction, which wasn't bad at all.
8029221	8031864	I used a basic strat style electric guitar.
8031985	8037412	Rocksmith will work with any electric guitar with a quarter inch jack.
8038233	8042578	I give this game the tomato frog stamp of approval for learning basic guitar.
8042798	8043039	GMJ.
8043971	8045512	Well, that actually is not a bad review.
8045592	8048974	You know, I like that he says it's more of a tool than a game.
8050115	8055219	And I'd be curious to see how much this catches on, if at all.
8055359	8062443	I mean, I think people are, like, they're just too ready to throw it into the rock band and guitar hero pile than to see what it really is.
8062583	8071469	But I appreciate the review because this was something that, I gotta admit, I don't really have a super-duper interest in learning to play the guitar, but it sounds like a neat way to learn.
8072190	8073871	I'm more of a keyboard person, keep in mind.
8074431	8086242	Piano, that stuff And our last email of the evening is from Fabrice in Belgium and he writes Hello OLR I love international emails Just saying
8087222	8089283	I'm thinking about filling up that gap next year on this convention.
8114560	8121569	although I don't know too much about him I've never had a chance to play Silent Hill he looks like such a badass character
8122990	8150369	Halloween's coming you really should check out Silent Hill I have something to whine about too it seems that every single game has downloadable content nowadays as I was randomly going through the Xbox Live Marketplace I saw there was even downloadable content for such a small and simple game as Fruit Ninja Connect I do get that developers and publishers want to make some more extra money but it's just crazy it feels more and more like content that should be included in the game when you first buy it
8152285	8156528	In two years time, if this trend continues, we will only buy half games for the full price.
8156628	8159030	I hate to say it, this trend's already been going for a long time.
8159230	8162132	And a lot of this is, you know, iOS has a lot of this too.
8162553	8166716	This is just kind of the world we live in right now and you really have to vote with your dollars.
8166876	8168437	Don't buy half-assed games.
8168757	8169058	Don't.
8169998	8170699	Do your research.
8171607	8174149	Well, as always, thanks a lot for making the show every week.
8174189	8175230	You guys really are awesome.
8175630	8178212	I'm voting almost every day for you guys for the podcast awards.
8178472	8179853	That's the least I can do for you.
8180033	8180734	Aw, shucks.
8181954	8182315	Shucks.
8182355	8182875	Thanks so much.
8182895	8183816	Fabrice in Belgium.
8184056	8185237	Really appreciate it, Fabrice.
8185677	8189560	You know, his story about the Sci-Fi convention, all the excitement that kind of went with that.
8189640	8192422	I bet a lot of that excitement is just being with other nerds.
8192882	8196106	I know that my first E3 was a lot like that.
8196186	8199909	It was all these professional people that really happened to be big fucking nerds like me.
8200410	8205475	I loved my first E3 and I don't think I'll ever go to one as good as that because of that.
8205776	8208278	It just reminded me of some other thing I read this week.
8208318	8208799	Did you see...
8210148	8211349	Here I go, opening Pandora's box.
8211869	8216491	There was some magazine, I want to say it was Men's Health, that did this piece on New York Comic Con.
8216951	8221853	And they just basically sent a photographer there to take pictures of fat cosplayers to put it on their website and make fun of them.
8221913	8228236	Like, you know, guys dressed as Captain America or something like that that have the beer bellies and things like that.
8228276	8228796	And I was just like...
8229576	8239219	You know, it's obviously men's health, so I don't know if they're just trying to make people feel bad about themselves, so they'll subscribe to the magazine to, I don't know, get health tips, but the whole thing just came off as hella fucking rude.
8239599	8244941	And like, you know, obviously Twitter and the internet, rightfully so, is pissed and demanding an apology.
8244981	8246061	I don't know if they ever got one.
8246081	8248082	I didn't follow the story that much, but it's just...
8249823	8252804	Just so classless.
8253304	8258306	But just all reason not to get that magazine, I suppose, that they're just going to be rude like that.
8258826	8264208	Who even in a boardroom, I mean office, or a story editor thinks that's funny?
8264568	8268370	Let's go to New York Comic Con and take pictures of fat people and we'll put them in the magazine.
8268830	8270931	That's like what the bullies did in high school.
8271851	8274252	Let's go pick on the fags and put them in the trash can.
8275372	8277033	It's just ridiculous.
8278789	8299348	shame on everybody involved with that and to the people that have the guts to dress up like in tights when they may not have perfect bodies I say props to you props to you for having the guts to get out there and do that cause those people that write for the magazines often won't even put their fucking pictures in the mag let's see a picture of the guy that wrote that article see what he looks like I bet he's not perfect
8301627	8312296	One last thing, we did get your email, DKPopMan, and also a shout out for TheDoctor90125, but what you talked about is actually coming up in just a few minutes, but we got your email.
8312616	8313557	Hello, DKPopMan.
8314518	8315338	Well, hello and thank you.
8315498	8322043	We always don't have time to do every email either, and I think that's important to keep in mind.
8322204	8322744	That's it for Mailbag.
8322764	8323985	But we do read them all.
8324085	8324345	Thank you.
8324705	8332127	Ranma posted that actually his show, Anime Jam Session, a friend of ours, actually wrote this whole counter article to it.
8333047	8334187	I'm not going to reread the whole thing.
8334227	8335247	He's posted it in chat.
8335708	8339808	The whole thing is infuriating enough where I really don't want to spend any more time talking about it.
8339868	8345050	But if you just want to see reasons why you should be mad, go read it.
8345550	8350671	You don't have to be fat to support fat rights because, you know...
8351831	8354252	How's that old saying go?
8354913	8361436	At first they didn't come for me and I said nothing and then they came for me and no one said anything.
8361676	8362196	Something like that.
8362637	8365318	Somebody in chat will remind me what that is.
8365358	8367679	Anyhow, let's move on with some more news.
8369400	8373002	It's hard to believe that this damn thing is so popular.
8376003	8376604	Angry Birds.
8378004	8378585	They're getting...
8380310	8383211	A film, and why?
8383311	8389612	Have they really run out of that many ideas that they have to create a movie based on this game?
8389952	8390632	It doesn't make any sense.
8390672	8395033	But anyways, the game's been downloaded over 400 million times, so they probably think, hey, you know what?
8395053	8397153	Let me make some money off that movie.
8399534	8404335	And of course, their revenue, Rovio is currently valued at $1.2 billion.
8404435	8406035	It's ridiculous.
8407035	8408116	Ridiculous, I say.
8409936	8436924	and to kind of go along with that Ubisoft they have a wonderful franchise called Assassin's Creed and Sony has apparently bought the rights to make a movie based on it and this is coming from also the fact that Sony has just recently started registering a bunch of websites for an Assassin's Creed movie so it's a good indicator and
8438104	8461157	Assassin's Creed might make a pretty good movie I think it could because it actually has a pretty decent storyline to go along with it so I could see that I see it more so than Angry Birds that's for sure Angry Birds has no plot I mean other than you know they're mad at pigs there's pigs and they did something that angered the birds and so you launch I mean I don't want to watch a movie where it's just birds flinging themselves at walls all movie long
8461445	8473893	I remember growing up in the 80s when Saturday morning cartoons were a thing and you had these really awful Saturday morning cartoons that were only on for a season that promoted the toys and the toys were there to promote the cartoon.
8474434	8477196	Why not just have an Angry Birds cartoon?
8477956	8478236	Right?
8478496	8480438	I mean... Makes sense.
8481679	8486422	But again, little kids don't have $400 smartphones to play the damn game on.
8487302	8491165	But yeah, it's like, why can't you just... You can play the game on almost everything now.
8491405	8494868	Well, yeah, it's on Google+, and the port on Google+, is actually pretty good.
8494968	8499752	But it's like, I just remember, why can't you just make a cartoon series to sell some plastic shit and be done with it?
8499852	8501473	I don't know why it needs a movie.
8503094	8503435	That's all.
8527637	8529057	SalaciousPop, do you want to start us off today?
8530238	8530878	Sure, I guess.
8531398	8537040	F you to waking up with headaches, which is weird because it's like I was asleep.
8537140	8538960	I should feel awesome, but now I have a headache.
8539340	8541461	It got better, though, after once I got to brunch and ate.
8541801	8543181	So just headaches are annoying.
8544161	8544942	They make me sad.
8545402	8546022	Headaches suck.
8546142	8546542	I agree.
8546802	8547562	Yeah.
8547782	8548083	Loki!
8549023	8549763	F you to waiting.
8553388	8554949	and DarkSakura.com
8578067	8588293	However, F you to the fact that I wasn't smart enough to take the time off anyway to drive down to Anaheim and go to DizCon, which was today, and just go to the parties.
8588574	8589374	Like, seriously.
8589534	8590855	Like, Slices Pop, am I right?
8590955	8595818	We should have just gone to Disneyland Friday, Saturday, and then went to the BlizzCon parties at night, right?
8596058	8596298	Yeah.
8596799	8597239	Totally.
8597739	8598660	We're so stupid!
8598680	8603423	Oops, I'm so mad that the freaking outro's playing now.
8607641	8609142	Let's move on with some more gaming news.
8609182	8612664	And then, of course, Twitter topics and the Skype line coming very soon.
8614345	8616566	3D Classics is this thing on the 3DS.
8616606	8620168	You know, they redid Excitebike and Urban Champion for some weird reason.
8620188	8622089	And there's been some other things in there as well, like Twinbee.
8622389	8623009	3D Classics 3D Classics
8652822	8654924	It's super easy to program these, I'm sure.
8655484	8658447	And it's a way to get you to buy virtual console games all over again.
8658808	8662211	Do I really need to be reminded how bloody hard that game was?
8662611	8664253	But seriously, that game is so fucking good.
8665494	8670900	Some people say you remember it through rose-colored glasses and it's not that good, but the music is amazing.
8671240	8674143	The dungeon levels are hard as hell and they're fun.
8674663	8675344	I'm just
8675624	8678807	I had to use the codes out of Nintendo Power Magazine to get any progress in that game.
8679047	8681269	Akaris fights Medusa Angels, or whatever it is.
8681929	8683671	Medusa fights Akaris Angels, you get the reverse.
8685412	8692758	My whole thing is that I'm really worried that if I were to purchase this, that the first time I get fucked over by an eggplant wizard, I'm going to throw my 3DS against the wall.
8693359	8694920	Like I used to throw my Nintendo controllers.
8695120	8697102	Because those eggplant wizards are fucking bastards.
8697122	8701365	And that music that plays when they get mad and they're like, you trolled me!
8706335	8708616	Oh my god, did you play a lot of Kid Icarus when you were younger?
8709396	8710297	Oh yeah, yeah.
8710697	8712057	Oh god, it's one of my favorites.
8712238	8716599	I completely missed the original Metroid train for the NES, and I was playing Kid Icarus instead.
8716719	8717340	Wait, here you go.
8717560	8719861	Let's see if this music makes you think of the Eggplant Wizards.
8720041	8720361	You ready?
8730525	8732166	How's that little sound they made, right?
8733365	8737687	Yeah, when they saw you, they were very animated and upset and they squeaked at you.
8737767	8738908	And the little babies flew out.
8739008	8741790	And then you had to go see that nurse who kind of looked like a trapezoid.
8741890	8743050	Like, what was up with that?
8746292	8747273	Nurse trapezoid.
8747513	8749114	I need the eggplant curse removed.
8752291	8755112	Anyhow, Salacious Pop, what do you have for us?
8755392	8765597	Soul Calibur V is getting a crossover franchise tie-in that makes sense and it's not Star Wars with Vader and Yoda and it's so good.
8765677	8768898	I gotta say, Starkiller was awesome though in that game.
8769118	8769618	He was OP.
8769679	8771119	He's a nice looking gentleman.
8771299	8772600	He's based off a real person, isn't he?
8772640	8775821	Sam Witwer, the actor, yeah, is Starkiller.
8775861	8779783	But anyway... How often are you thinking about this guy?
8782251	8798705	Enzo from Assassin's Creed the last few Assassin's Creed games is in Soul Calibur 5 and it looks super badass and he fits in stylistically with everyone it was one of those things when they announced that I was like oh I didn't think of that
8799305	8803387	It's better than Kratos in Mortal Kombat, and even that was reasonable.
8805607	8808729	So yeah, Enzo is in Soul Calibur V, it's confirmed.
8808789	8810109	I believe there are screenshots.
8810889	8815371	And there's another little promotional tidbit that they've released for us.
8815911	8819673	There is a special pre-order bonus character named Dampir.
8820513	8823634	and he is very wacky and silly.
8824314	8837919	He's kind of a vaudeville circus MC with a hat and sort of like a villainous, the curly mustache that ties the damsel in distress on the railroad tracks.
8839019	8841760	And he's got striped pants and he's very nutty.
8843901	8848943	And you should watch the gameplay trailer of him doing his moves and it's like, this guy is nuts.
8849443	8851305	You get to make your own characters again, right?
8851685	8852185	I believe so.
8852205	8854287	Because I remember, was it Soul Calibur 3 or 4?
8854668	8855488	I think it was you, Loki.
8855508	8856189	It must have been 3.
8856409	8858831	It must have been back when we were living together when Soul Calibur 3 came out.
8859131	8862614	And you made that character named Benedict that looked like the Pope.
8862735	8863155	That wasn't me.
8863175	8863795	I thought that was.
8864036	8864676	Was that Extifer?
8864696	8865597	It must have been Extifer then.
8866178	8867279	Why did I think it was you, Loki?
8867819	8869060	I get you and Extifer confused.
8869080	8870501	I don't know how that's even possible.
8870581	8870862	Yeah.
8872623	8873083	Good times.
8873964	8879987	And he kind of reminds me of a silly character from Street Fighter 4 who I hate.
8880407	8883048	The big, giant, large guy.
8883088	8883448	Rufus.
8883608	8885089	Rufus with the balloon belly.
8885149	8886090	He's the American character.
8886390	8887850	This is just Capcom being silly.
8888211	8892313	This guy, to me, is that but done in a way that isn't totally stupid.
8893853	8897315	Rufus has fans, so Rufus is going to be in the Street Fighter X Tekken game.
8898851	8900413	Well, that makes sense, I think.
8901094	8907361	Yeah, so Enzo, awesome, and this weird, wacky circus vaudeville guy, Dampier, if you pre-order the game.
8908042	8911826	And that, when is, I think I had a release date here for when that game was coming out.
8912106	8912727	Yeah, next year.
8913007	8915210	January 31st, I want to say.
8915510	8916732	Yeah, it's near the beginning of the year.
8916872	8919335	Soul Calibur fans, rejoice.
8920175	8922257	We'll be buying that, just so you know.
8922437	8923397	I played the hell out of 4.
8923538	8926319	Soul Calibur is my favorite fighting game franchise, so that's going to be awesome.
8926680	8927060	I can't wait.
8927520	8929902	In fact, we should start playing Soul Calibur 4 again in anticipation.
8930322	8930662	I have it on 360.
8931643	8932023	Good times.
8933424	8934705	I never did buy Vader, though.
8935926	8939008	For modded consoles, they have a topless version.
8939548	8941470	Of course, of course.
8941610	8944052	Ivy's like two pixels away from being topless.
8944392	8946333	I have Yoda and Vader on my 360 account, so...
8948402	8948602	Nice.
8948822	8949483	Through me, you have it.
8951124	8953405	All right, a couple more stories for you guys, then we'll get to the Twitters.
8955246	8955506	Loki.
8956227	8974017	So there's a lot of high-concept stuff that Microsoft's doing, especially since they just had the Sesame Street Once Upon a Monster game come out on Xbox 360 for Kinect just last week.
8974798	8980164	And so now they're kind of showing what they could possibly do for new things.
8980445	8985411	So next year, they're talking already, there's going to be a game called Pixar's Rush.
8986432	8988155	And what this will allow you to do is...
8990217	8993258	And then of course, going with that, they're going to also do Connect Sesame Street TV Which is...
9012182	9012803	Kind of neat.
9012863	9021471	What it is, is it's going to be something that you watch actual TV shows, or almost like episodes, and you can interact with them using Kinect.
9021972	9030260	So they showed one that showed kind of an almost live-action feed of Grover or whatever trying to... Can I choke Elmo?
9031301	9032022	I don't know about that.
9032901	9034062	Connect National Geographic TV
9048909	9069847	and with that you can know they have like people going okay you know who can spot you know whatever so you're like you know kind of have like a punch card almost that you're okay I see a moose and you know whoever shouts it out first you'll get the point and that kind of stuff or you can ask about more information on certain things it's like interactive TV oh that's
9070347	9072911	Kind of neat, if it works.
9073071	9075975	That makes the Kinect very useful, actually.
9076135	9081622	That, to me, seems like something that would be more useful for their TV service.
9082603	9088151	Especially since I would hope that something like that would be kind of free since PBS is free for the most part.
9089696	9092678	So that'd be kind of cool if they had Sesame Street and stuff.
9092698	9093999	You could download episodes.
9094820	9096421	Why can't they do this with adult shows?
9097082	9099364	Like, can I vote for American Idol through my Kinect?
9099824	9100525	That'd be kind of cool.
9102246	9105429	Or yell, fuck this guy, and it'll be a negative vote or something.
9106330	9106530	Maybe.
9108494	9129806	um going to our chat room the chat is a little bit behind because the live delay they're commenting on the Soul Calibur story a little bit here um HitStun wanted to throw out there that Dom Pierre debuted in Soul Calibur 4 PSP I guess sometimes the Soul Calibur series kind of does these previews uh HitStun says just like Amy's moveset debuted in Soul Calibur 3 Arcade Edition before showing up in Soul Calibur 4 so sometimes you get a little sneak peek
9130826	9132788	I didn't play the Soul Calibur PSP.
9133608	9134029	I don't know why.
9134069	9135410	I just didn't think it would transfer very well.
9135430	9136951	It's like an action RPG, I think, right?
9136991	9139252	Where it's fighting matches, but also a story mode.
9139593	9141234	I think it's a lot more fighting.
9141654	9143636	And I believe, if I'm not mistaken, Kratos was on that.
9144496	9144676	Yeah.
9145217	9145597	Funny enough.
9146037	9147198	Kratos is in everything!
9147378	9149900	Alright, what'll he be in next?
9150000	9150621	Angry Birds?
9152153	9158817	Alright, last but not least tonight before we get to the Skype line is a story about toilet gaming.
9159397	9163639	Yes, we've heard about this before, but no, seriously, it's like going on to the next level now.
9164040	9168922	Sega Toys is making these toilets where you can actually game with pee.
9169262	9172925	There's all sorts of mini-games, like erasing graffiti with a hose.
9173445	9174846	You can guess what the hose is.
9175586	9178348	You can use wind to blow under a woman's skirt.
9178448	9179908	Somehow your pee is wind.
9180369	9180709	I don't know.
9181709	9183531	And do I even want to read this?
9185292	9188134	A Bukkake battle where you shoot milk from your nose.
9188994	9189495	No!
9192577	9197920	Yes, in fact, you can actually see some pictures here at mycom.co.jp.
9198301	9199722	You can actually see pictures of the...
9201044	9203606	Little urinals here with the little TV monitors in them.
9203646	9204226	See, look at that.
9204987	9206168	See, that creeps me out, though.
9206508	9208369	Doesn't that look like a little webcam at the top?
9208469	9213112	Like, who knows what images are being transmitted to Sega headquarters on that thing?
9213172	9214633	Like, you sick pervos.
9214974	9229284	And for this screenshot here with the little angry cloud of wind that's trying to blow up the girl's dress so that we can, you know, see her underwear, I'm just thinking of some dude totally dunking his ass over this thing and letting one rip and then sharting.
9229884	9236907	and it's like, dear Sega, your game made me shit my pants and I'm very upset that the little fart cloud panty game made me do this.
9239848	9240288	Sorry.
9240428	9246470	Do you have to insert a quarter to make this work or is it just like, are we going back to pay toilets or what's the deal?
9246610	9248351	Oh, you gotta insert something.
9248791	9249271	Stop.
9251674	9257778	Just think of, you know, people drunk, they can't aim, you work in an arcade, you're like, I'm not cleaning this up.
9257798	9259538	This would be a hilarious thing to have at a bar.
9260779	9266122	But let's just all form a prayer circle right now and hope that this never shows up in the US.
9267482	9268423	Let's just bow our heads.
9271522	9273182	Alright, we're going to open up the Skype line.
9273222	9273883	It's about time.
9273903	9277964	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9277984	9284065	We will take your calls about anything you want to talk about tonight, whether it be a story that we've talked about or something that maybe we didn't get to.
9284565	9288506	Maybe you want to talk about how you've had yourself barricaded in your room all week playing Arkham City.
9288546	9290767	I'd love to hear about it because sadly none of us did that.
9291667	9293069	There you go.
9293089	9297173	1877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9297313	9298795	It is a toll-free number in the U.S.
9298835	9300917	and Canada, but I can't speak for other countries.
9301037	9303499	I would suggest if you're in another country, you get Skype for free.
9303680	9306302	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
9307063	9309626	Meanwhile, while we wait for calls, we're going to go to the Twitters.
9311156	9318278	Dark Tetsuya tweets us, if the DDR freak thing doesn't wind up happening, we should totally organize a tournament of some sort for our 10th next year.
9318838	9320778	That's kind of what I want to do anyway.
9320818	9332001	In fact, I've kind of put DarkSakura in charge of putting the 10th thing together because she knows people that do stuff at places that we want to be involved with.
9332081	9333441	And I can't say much more than that.
9333481	9335322	But we are trying to make the 10th a big deal.
9335362	9339583	But I want to warn you guys, it may not be on the exact anniversary of the show.
9340183	9341304	Death Wishings Dave Gruelkahn
9360988	9364270	I'm not going to pay $130 to play demos of betas.
9364330	9365892	I'm going to sell my soul to Blizzard to get in.
9365912	9368273	But you can see all those cool pandas.
9368373	9371496	I can see all that cool shit on DirecTV, and I've got this thing called the internet.
9371516	9375959	But pandas, Panda Continent, Panda Class, Panda Games, and Pokemon.
9375979	9377240	Panda, fuck off.
9377580	9378420	I don't care.
9380422	9384685	So actually, I want to talk to Loki about Grand Theft Auto mods.
9384765	9385746	All right, that'll cost a dollar.
9386522	9387323	Interesting mod.
9387763	9389344	Have you heard of that ice?
9389524	9391626	I think it's like icy enhancer.
9393027	9397049	Yeah, it's EMB stuff.
9397150	9399891	It does like a crazy texture, like mods and all that.
9399911	9403214	It makes the game look just like ungodly beautiful.
9404174	9406896	Yeah, a lot of the EMB stuff looks pretty good.
9407717	9408918	And I mean, do you use it?
9409098	9409698	Can you run it?
9409718	9412921	Because me and my friend were worried that he wants to install it.
9413732	9415514	But he's afraid that he can't run it.
9416616	9418098	Because he doesn't have a core i7.
9418458	9419039	I think he only has an i3.
9422028	9422468	Caramageddon mod.
9449813	9451094	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9480346	9482267	I'm whatever about the panda thing.
9482307	9488070	I think it's a little silly that they're bifactional, but I think it'll be good in the long run.
9488151	9489712	I love the art style.
9489752	9496636	Even though I'm meh on the pandas, I would have been 100% totally okay with this had the pandaren been NPCs.
9496716	9497997	I kind of think they should have stayed.
9498697	9501060	I would have rather seen the Tuskar be playable.
9501320	9503222	Well, of course, I just want a Tuskar named Diabetes.
9503762	9510549	But the Tuskar or the Tonka, what are the Tauren-like people called?
9510689	9511269	The Bison.
9511449	9513111	They're Tonka, yeah.
9513191	9514512	They could have been a great playable class.
9514572	9517075	The Naga, everybody thinks is inevitable at some point.
9517375	9519197	It just seems like there's a lot of other stuff they could have chosen from.
9519217	9520378	But fine, they went cute.
9520686	9521787	I mean, I understand.
9521807	9525088	I guess pandas allegedly are a part of the lore, my friend said.
9525268	9527229	Yeah, but they're always joke lore.
9527449	9537775	I know, but it's like, honestly, I mean, every update I've seen, and wow, the ones that have added big segments were, this is part of the segment, and then there's all this shit to do.
9537835	9541497	And then it was like, Cataclysm, oh, it changes the map, but there's all this shit to do.
9541517	9545499	And then this one's just like, fucking pandas everywhere.
9545579	9546039	Look at this.
9546059	9546879	We're so cool.
9546959	9547660	Weeaboo now.
9549028	9550229	Well, look, here's the thing, though.
9550249	9553231	At the end of the day, I probably will not be rolling a panda monk.
9553851	9557334	I will have to roll a gnome monk, because that's going to be awesome, because gnomes are hilarious.
9557354	9558174	Oh, you can be a gnome monk?
9558294	9559875	I thought only pandas could be monks.
9559935	9565559	No, anybody can be monks, except, funny enough, Worgen and Goblin, who were the additions in the last expansion.
9566200	9571103	Every other race in the game can be... I'm just waiting to see a bunch of pandas with a variation of the name Jack Black.
9571463	9572184	Yeah, I know, right?
9572364	9573164	Reserve the names now.
9574385	9578548	Salacious Pop told a funny joke on Horde House about... What was it you said about female pandarins?
9579693	9585775	Their slash dance emote is they're just going to sit in a chair and move their hand around like Adele and roll in in the deep.
9586555	9587556	They're just going to sit in a chair.
9587856	9591817	I was trying to get a panda named Adele, but the name was already taken.
9592037	9593158	Somebody beat us to it.
9594258	9605562	But here's the thing, Deathwishing, and I kind of said this at the top of the show, but I'm more excited about the fact that they're giving players at level 90 so much more to do than just dungeon, raiding, and PvP.
9605842	9607363	Which is already a lot as it is, but now...
9608903	9610724	Pokemon, believe it or not, it's a thing.
9610965	9611885	People will be into it.
9612546	9615127	Challenge Dungeons, I'm really excited about Challenge Dungeons.
9615147	9618790	I think they're just scared because of the older public.
9618810	9619570	Of course they are.
9621031	9623353	I stopped playing EVE Online just because of that.
9623893	9624834	I'm going to be playing that.
9625034	9625735	Here's the thing.
9626575	9628537	I have no doubt that the game will be good.
9628797	9632019	However, we have gone through this how many times?
9632657	9634258	Age of Conan was going to be the killer.
9634398	9636519	Then EverQuest 2, and then Warhammer.
9636539	9637700	But you don't understand, man.
9637860	9638941	It's Star Wars.
9639401	9640081	I know, I know.
9640902	9647365	I'm telling you, all the people from Star Wars Galaxies will play it because of the remorse of Star Wars Galaxy shutting down.
9648426	9651207	They may not like it, but they'll just cry themselves while playing it.
9651788	9652628	I miss you.
9654969	9655710	That's all I can say.
9657339	9659880	Obviously, Blizzard is going to lose some people to Star Wars.
9660020	9663402	That's why they've come up with this whole annual pass thing to lock you in anyway.
9663522	9668905	I mean, that's no... I mean, I heard that buying a year pass now, you can get Diablo 3 for free.
9668925	9670186	That's from what I heard.
9671347	9675029	And that's just kind of solidifying that Activision Blizzard has too much money.
9676414	9679355	We'll give you the game that we know we're going to make shitloads of money on for free.
9679635	9680215	Not really.
9680315	9681435	Because we have too much money.
9681775	9682016	I know.
9682036	9683876	They're going to make money on Diablo anyway.
9684016	9690938	And like I said earlier, if you're contracted for a year of WoW, you pretty much are guaranteed to get Mists of Pandaria, which they're not giving you for free.
9692718	9693599	Mists of Pandaria.
9694519	9694839	All right.
9694919	9698040	Any other BlizzCon or what have you thoughts before we let you go, buddy?
9700692	9703294	Did anything cool happen with the whole Foo Fighters thing?
9703334	9705216	Any reports on that, or was it just Foo Fighters?
9705236	9707218	Dave Grohl played the guitar in the audience, that's what I heard.
9707819	9710642	Oh, okay, so I already seen that live.
9710882	9711623	Okay, cool.
9711763	9712644	Alright, cool story, bro.
9712664	9713264	Take care, buddy.
9717170	9725257	I still want the WoW expansion Myths of Panera Bread so I can get a turkey feta panini with side salad.
9725377	9728019	Kaijudo in chat says, back off Adele, she's hot.
9728079	9729381	Hey, I never said she wasn't hot.
9730021	9734425	Everybody's into whatever, but I'm sorry, it's just the joke was too good.
9735646	9736046	Had to be there.
9736407	9736647	All right.
9737247	9737548	Let's see.
9737568	9738548	Moving on with some more tweets.
9739149	9742551	MNZiba tweets us saying, Loki, is this what you do when you play Grand Theft Auto?
9742671	9747255	Usually I don't click on YouTubes that I don't know what they are, but I'm going to take a chance on this one.
9747295	9747735	Let's see.
9749256	9749877	That's funny.
9761843	9763985	It looks like Night Nito is just throwing cars around.
9764866	9766247	It is very hard to play that.
9766808	9774595	I once contemplated doing that as part of the mod, but I was quickly vetoed on that because they're like, uh, yeah.
9774615	9777378	So you're trying to do the campaign stuff, or is this for Deathmatch?
9777398	9778279	Oh, are you trying to run around?
9778319	9779800	Wait, I gotta take this call.
9779840	9780941	It's very appropriate of the time.
9781101	9782102	Hi, you're on Warner Sounds Radio.
9782122	9782482	Who's this?
9783203	9800756	Hi, this is Ziba Ziba, we're watching this video, I am cracking the hell up at this Grand Theft Auto stuff, this is great Yeah, I found that on my Twitter, I was like, oh god, I just thought of Loki just right when I watched it And I love that they used the Benny Hill theme, A+, thumbs up Thanks So what's on your mind tonight, Ziba?
9801777	9805940	Um, I just want to let you know, you jinxed my iPhone Oh shit, what did I do?
9807962	9813745	A couple days later that you announced that your iPhone's power button went, mine went.
9814485	9815285	Oh, no.
9815606	9816046	I'm sorry.
9816186	9817286	Is it the sleep button?
9817526	9818667	Yes, the sleep button.
9818687	9821208	The sleep power button, whatever you want to call it on the top.
9821808	9822729	They're faulty.
9823109	9824149	I want a refund.
9824530	9825370	I'm suing Apple.
9825390	9825850	Class action.
9825950	9827371	I'm suing Steve Jobs.
9827771	9828491	Wait, can't do that.
9828571	9829892	I'm suing Tim Cook.
9830472	9831893	I'm suing everybody.
9833140	9838726	Well, thank God that my iPhone is not a year old yet, so I still had warranty.
9838786	9840628	So they were able to give me a whole new phone.
9841049	9841569	Nice.
9841870	9842450	You know what's funny?
9842490	9850579	My very first iPhone 4, the little ringer button, the little thing on the side next to the volume that turns the ringer on and off, that was broken.
9851320	9879920	but that was like day one a break so they gave me a new phone for free but it was still I had to re-sync everything I'm gonna get a new phone but probably in January and I've got to decide between now and then if I'm just gonna say you know what forget the iPhone I'm done with it and go to the iPad or if I'm gonna get suckered in and buy the iPhone 4S anyway of which everybody's just raving about Siri oh I love Siri I love Siri so how are you liking your iPhone though otherwise do you do any gaming on it
9880498	9881399	I have some games.
9881519	9890985	I have like Secret of Mana and Final Fantasy Tactics and Katamari Damacy and Infinity Blade.
9891986	9893827	Is it just me or do a lot of them play like poop?
9894850	9898472	Yeah, especially Secret of Mana is really hard to move around.
9898712	9899893	Yeah, it's unfortunate.
9900113	9903315	They made it a little better, but it still is pretty hard.
9903855	9916902	I will say though, the Final Fantasy 3 remake, it's probably still like 15 bucks, which is like 15 times as much what most games cost, but it's actually done really well and it's easy to control.
9917142	9922545	So I gotta say the Final Fantasy 3 remake from the DS is really good on iPhone.
9923866	9938335	or iPad whatever it is you're gonna game on out there in the audience so I did have the DS version so I'm not really into you know getting it on my phone yeah you don't need to buy the same thing twice that's true no so what else have you been playing any any console or PC games
9939187	9940588	I did get a new DS game.
9940928	9942649	I can't really pronounce the name.
9942709	9946311	It's like Sola del Robo, The Red Hunter.
9946611	9946871	Okay.
9947271	9949913	What's this game about?
9949973	9952394	All the furries are getting it, but that's not why I got it.
9954255	9954875	But it's...
9956076	9970752	I just kind of just started playing it, so I really don't know too much about the story, but you are this fox, and you're just trying to save the world, but I really don't know too much about the story, like I said, I have to keep going at it, but I like it so far.
9972034	9973816	Nice, and why are the furries into it?
9974980	9979385	because it's all anthropomorphic characters in it.
9981346	9982207	That sounds like fun.
9983208	9985751	Salacious Pop, did I see your eyes just perk up a little bit?
9985891	9986171	Yiff.
9988313	9988773	Oh, God.
9988793	9989494	Please don't go there.
9990455	9991035	All right.
9992136	9995957	Ziba, I hope you enjoy the game and enjoy your phone now that it works again.
9996097	9999018	And I'm sorry to curse you, but I'm really happy that... Oh, I'm really just joking.
9999358	10002399	I know, I know, but I'm glad you at least got a replacement for free.
10003059	10008601	To be fair, I still need to take mine to the store and see if there's anything they can do with it, but I don't have my hopes up because I didn't buy AppleCare.
10010781	10012222	All right, well, Ziba, I'm going to let you go, okay?
10012743	10013183	Okay, thank you.
10013203	10013663	All right, take care.
10013683	10015124	Thanks for calling in, and thanks again for the video.
10015765	10016285	No problem.
10016345	10016565	Later.
10016585	10020928	1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
10021248	10025551	Going to some other tweets, Zether77 tweets us saying, You guys may want to see this.
10025612	10029234	It's probably going to be the pinball video game to end all pinball video games.
10029654	10036319	And gives this cheap plug for Pinball Arcade, which I guess is for the phones and so forth.
10036872	10039073	This is like something you're working on or something.
10039153	10039553	I don't know.
10041233	10042734	Oh shit, it has Arabian Nights.
10042794	10043194	I'm there.
10044695	10045975	Fucking love the Arabian Nights table.
10046215	10050557	Isn't this just... I feel like Emilia.
10050677	10055118	Oh, it looks like they have an arrangement with various pinball table folks.
10055678	10059019	There's Black Hole because it's got Bally's Stern.
10059220	10060640	Oh my god, Theater of Magic.
10060700	10061260	I'm so in.
10061540	10062921	This is like the best table ever.
10064401	10064841	You remember this?
10064881	10065542	Did you ever play that?
10065722	10065922	Yeah.
10066202	10066322	Oh.
10068021	10068922	Red Dead Redemption on Kinect?
10068962	10069002	No.
10086963	10091246	I think Red Dead Redemption on Kinect would not be as good as just Red Dead Redemption.
10092127	10092407	I don't know.
10092447	10097271	I don't think people should feel forced to pigeonhole an existing game into the Kinect.
10097311	10099112	That Fable game really has me worried.
10099312	10101054	What are you talking about?
10101134	10101914	It has you worried?
10103297	10106221	It's gonna suck, like all the other ones have sucked.
10107002	10107342	I know.
10107402	10110466	Because Peter Molyneux is full of crap.
10110526	10111927	But he's new and cutting edge.
10111987	10113349	No, he's not new and cutting edge.
10113369	10114050	He's stupid.
10114190	10115912	Hey, ah!
10115992	10117634	Hey, Zaku, welcome to the show.
10117995	10118635	What's on your mind, buddy?
10119536	10120277	Oh, nothing much.
10120357	10122320	Just trying to, like, absorb all the...
10122796	10125077	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10146989	10148330	Oh, I didn't realize it was that soon.
10148370	10149451	It's this Tuesday, huh?
10149471	10150713	Yeah.
10151653	10157479	Because of work and everything, I didn't have the time to start speccing on a new computer, so I'm going to have to play catch-up.
10157699	10159401	You've called in to talk about this game before.
10159421	10161723	Are you excited about this?
10162223	10162463	Yes.
10162884	10170811	I mean, I've seen footage of the beta so far, and it's pretty much a lot better than Bad Company 2, at the very least.
10171372	10172052	More importantly...
10172913	10178578	It does step it up as being the most realistic first-person shooter this year.
10178858	10182001	Did you decide to go PC, Xbox?
10182061	10182442	PC.
10183182	10186745	Why do you think I just said that I'm trying to spec out a new PC for you?
10186865	10187326	Oh, derp.
10187446	10187726	Okay.
10188147	10189288	So I don't listen very well.
10189368	10189748	My bad.
10189768	10192971	Doesn't that suck, though, that you have to upgrade your PC to play?
10192991	10195993	I mean, I've already made my decision between that and Modern Warfare 3.
10196394	10198195	I mean, at this point, it's like...
10199204	10203386	Even with Modern Warfare 3, even the fact they have dedicated servers, they're only for unranked.
10203906	10210868	So it's like, if I wanted to level up in that game, I would have to put up with the peer-to-peer crap, which is not good on the PC.
10210908	10212049	It's a horrible experience.
10212089	10213329	It's only meant for consoles.
10213829	10220772	I think the way I see it is Activision giving us half... It's like going halfway instead of actually...
10222935	10236050	What about if you can set up these controlled, super easy environments where somebody could just have a server that's for nothing but ranking up quickly and it would kind of ruin things?
10236130	10237391	I can kind of see that side of it.
10237611	10238332	Well, that's the thing.
10238392	10241816	I mean, I played Modern Warfare on the...
10244022	10248864	Played on PC with the servers and I was able to rank up easily.
10248924	10251845	Then again, I have skill with the keyboard and mouse.
10251965	10255226	But the point is that it didn't really impact cheating as much.
10255806	10263269	Because either way, once they spotted you as a cheater, you automatically get kicked and banned from that server.
10264190	10265510	Punkbuster works pretty well.
10266491	10267371	It's a pretty good hammer.
10268131	10270192	Yeah, but is leveling up quickly cheating?
10271195	10278599	Well, cheating in the sense of when they find people hacking or cheating in that particular server, the admins boot them really fast.
10279660	10291627	But I could see why Activision is trying to release their half-baked solution for the lack of any servers in Modern Warfare 2.
10292688	10294088	They still want to push Elite.
10295629	10296610	That whole elite thing.
10297210	10305977	And the fact that having a dedicated server ranked, they believe that they will probably game the system that way.
10307218	10315324	You have folks that find exploits that aren't really patched, or more importantly, you set up a server just for the sake of ranking really fast.
10315464	10323190	I know Team Fortress 2 had this issue back in the day where it's just people idling in order to get unlocks.
10326281	10327882	I could see why they did that.
10327922	10338652	Battlefield 3 has dedicated servers, but it's almost like Bad Company 2 where everything's going to be from third-party providers.
10339212	10340994	But it's still a good solution, though.
10343004	10348048	Well, I mean, at the end of the day, you're going to buy both games no matter what, right?
10348468	10350369	I'm probably going to just stick with Battlefield 3.
10350409	10351770	I've already made my decision.
10351910	10356053	I'm not going to touch Modern Warfare 3 unless I can pick it up for dirt cheap.
10356173	10360036	Otherwise, I'm just going to stick with Battlefield 3.
10360276	10365380	I know it's not on Steam and I'm going to have to bite the bullet and give Origin a shot.
10366018	10369020	Well, props to you sticking by your guns and voting with your dollars.
10369380	10370160	That's what we always say.
10370181	10372342	If you feel strongly enough, vote with your dollars.
10372842	10377585	All right, Sakura, we're going to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but have fun and hopefully see you next week's show.
10377605	10378866	You're not too busy playing Battlefield.
10379546	10380167	Well, that's the thing.
10380207	10385590	If I can get a computer in a week, which I doubt, it's going to take a few more weeks for me to spec out everything.
10386490	10388952	All right, then we know when you disappear what happened.
10389712	10390193	Exactly.
10390353	10391133	All right, take care, buddy.
10391693	10391974	All right.
10392374	10392574	Bye.
10394247	10395889	Alright, that's going to do it for Skype calls tonight.
10395929	10398453	For those that didn't get through, sorry, but try writing us an email.
10398513	10403259	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com I want to quickly wrap up the rest of these tweets though, real quick.
10403740	10405822	Osfer tweets us saying a couple things.
10406663	10408926	First, I'm watching people play the new Spyro.
10409007	10411430	It doesn't look nearly as bad as Loki describes.
10415168	10420630	It's all about, not necessarily the gameplay, but the message behind it.
10421390	10422271	It sets precedent.
10423051	10426513	And Osfer also asks, random question for the staff.
10426893	10428213	Who is your favorite Pokemon?
10428413	10429234	Mine is Mewtwo.
10430874	10431635	I have an answer for this.
10431675	10433856	Does anyone else on staff have a way to answer for this?
10433896	10434516	Salacious Pop?
10435116	10437157	You watch or play Pokemon?
10437397	10437777	Bidoof.
10438358	10439098	What's Bidoof?
10439538	10440679	I've never heard of Bidoof.
10440939	10442139	How did you make that up?
10442199	10448422	I need to Google it, but he's the little squirrel that's stupid and he's like the worst Pokemon ever.
10449562	10451684	My favorite Pokemon by far is Jigglypuff.
10452304	10456467	The one that gets really pissed off when she sings and puts everyone to sleep that she draws on their face with a marker.
10457088	10458949	Those are always my favorite episodes of the old show.
10459630	10460950	Loki, do you have a favorite Pokemon?
10461211	10462391	I don't know any of the Pokemon.
10465273	10467375	One of these days I want to convince Loki to a bet.
10467415	10471618	I mean, obviously we're never going to get him to dress up as the Tingle outfit, but we have to think of other things that would be awesome.
10471978	10475380	And I think one of them would be that Loki would have to sing the Pokemon rap on air.
10475401	10475481	Yeah.
10479144	10481065	Aw, that's a cute little derpy mon.
10481085	10481505	I like this.
10481805	10483045	Is that the one you... That's Bidoof.
10483085	10483465	Bidoof?
10485605	10487346	On YouTube, everyone should Google.
10487426	10491707	It was UPN's Cartoon Afternoons.
10491907	10495967	It was one of the bumpers they made between Batman, the animated series, and Pokemon.
10496688	10498968	And it's Batman Sings Jigglypuff.
10499008	10500768	And if you find it, you should just pull it up right now.
10501549	10502169	Super awesome.
10502189	10504849	It's a bumper that UPN made.
10504889	10507150	Could it be this right here?
10508530	10510352	Jigglypuff, a balloon Pokemon.
10510372	10511472	Time for bed.
10512093	10513774	Alright, but a deal's a deal.
10514375	10514815	No way.
10515156	10516136	You promised.
10518118	10525985	Jigglypuff, Jigglypuff.
10527986	10529868	Alright, can I... The whole thing.
10533775	10538499	Pokemon Next on Kids WB WB, not UPN, my bad.
10539740	10541121	Ah, same thing now, it doesn't matter.
10542102	10542842	Good times.
10543423	10544243	I love Jigglypuff.
10545124	10548226	Some tweets from TigerClaw305, sends us a couple tweets.
10548707	10551169	I thought you hit on this one earlier in the show, Loki.
10551269	10554912	Was it the Portal 2 DLC that will have an in-game map editor with it?
10555092	10555292	Yeah.
10555832	10557253	I thought you'd mention something about that.
10557313	10560156	Well, it does come with an in-game map editor as well, if you didn't already know.
10560756	10561477	And that's cool.
10562417	10564518	And I'll see you next time.
10587256	10587656	and DarkSakura.
10613207	10616828	and it's going to have an online co-op mode that can affect the single player game.
10617389	10617809	Interesting.
10618169	10628592	So yep, if you activate a Battlefield 3 online pass on any of the platforms, I guess the EA account, your account will just be enabled with this access to get the demo.
10629053	10632554	So that's kind of cool on whatever system the code was redeemed on.
10634017	10635918	Actually, no, I take that back.
10636198	10638599	It doesn't have to be for the account that you bought it on.
10638659	10647063	It says that the access is applied to the EA account, so meaning if you buy Battlefield 3 on the PC, you can get the demo on the PlayStation 3 or whatever you want to do.
10647083	10649644	So it's kind of tradable amongst those.
10650105	10650685	That's kind of neat.
10651926	10656868	There will be other ways for the rest of us to get in there if you're not buying Battlefield 3, so don't cry.
10658380	10663785	Lastly, but not leastly, a couple of tweets from Ramaditya Knight sends us some tweets.
10664225	10669629	Hey, OLR, the Sonic 1 and 2 soundtrack to celebrate his 20th birthday has been released this month.
10669970	10671551	So if you're a Sonic fan, you should go get it.
10671591	10675795	I seem to remember a story on that coming up before, like when it was first announced, but it's good to know that it's out.
10676435	10678277	And you might remember that name Ramaditya...
10678817	10704896	Ramaditya Knight does a lot of these tin whistle or the recorder he does like a lot of these songs and he sent us a new YouTube at his account which is Ramaditya Skywalker and he's actually playing the Green Hill Zone theme obviously he's using the background that might not be the best part where he's playing the same three notes over and over
10707751	10712132	That's a little better.
10712152	10712772	Still irritating.
10712812	10715672	Hey, hey, hey, I don't see you playing a musical instrument.
10715732	10716993	I don't think you should be making fun.
10717493	10718693	I don't think you should be making fun.
10719313	10720173	I think you're talented.
10720213	10720993	Don't listen to Loki.
10722614	10724034	I played the clarinet when I was younger.
10724814	10725534	You sure did.
10725654	10726294	I sure did.
10727374	10729255	I probably couldn't play that on the clarinet anymore.
10729375	10731055	I could probably play the squeak song.
10731095	10732995	That's probably about all I could play on the clarinet these days.
10733076	10733676	Band geek.
10734336	10734716	Shut up.
10734836	10735796	What's wrong with being a band geek?
10737413	10740974	I would try to be a band geek, but I was too weak to carry my instrument, and I was picked on.
10740994	10742875	That's because you tried to play the fucking tuba.
10743035	10744195	No, trombone.
10744315	10745075	Oh, my bad.
10745375	10747396	But you were like this, weren't you like a really scrawny kid?
10747576	10747856	Oh, yeah.
10748356	10749756	And now you're like six foot four?
10750157	10755678	I'm still weak as hell, but I'm six foot four-ish, so there's at least a lot of me, yeah.
10757099	10765781	All right, and the chat room is asking for a link of Ramaditya Knight's performance there, and stupid me forgot to link that, so let me do that right now.
10767219	10771780	for the chatters in the chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
10771820	10772420	There you go.
10773861	10774301	There it is.
10774381	10776922	And Ranma says in chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
10777002	10778942	And now Sky plays the skin flute.
10779562	10780283	Yeah, screw you.
10781043	10782523	All right.
10783683	10784084	That's it.
10784484	10784924	We're done.
10785124	10787004	We're wrapping up another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
10787044	10789365	I got to ask first if there's any last minute stories, Loki.
10790700	10792481	Yeah, there was just one.
10792641	10803810	It was basically they announced that in Sonic Generations you can unlock the original Sonic the Hedgehog game.
10804150	10804690	Again?
10805591	10806892	Yeah, that's totally new news.
10806912	10809174	How many times did they release the first Sonic game for real?
10809294	10810935	Absolutely brand new news.
10811315	10815058	Unless you listened to our show back in August in which I actually revealed that same thing.
10815678	10817960	So yeah, totally new.
10819437	10826365	Well, if you somehow missed out on your nine other opportunities to re-buy Sonic the Hedgehog, the original, here you go.
10826825	10830489	Sonic Generations is bad, and they have a couple of dev ones out if you want to check them out.
10830789	10830989	Nice.
10831890	10832171	All right.
10832391	10834974	Well, that's going to wrap up another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
10835294	10837857	We're going to go around first and get everybody's final thought.
10838057	10841381	And my final thought tonight is skinny fries.
10842293	10842913	I am full of them.
10842993	10843894	We ate that whole bag.
10844014	10844794	I know, we're fat.
10844974	10845735	Actually, you know what, though?
10845895	10847636	In that entire bag, there's only six grams of fat.
10847676	10848216	That's not that bad.
10848776	10850137	There's more grams of fat like in a muffin.
10851438	10851698	All right.
10852478	10853779	Salacious Pop, what's your final thought tonight?
10855260	10856680	Thank you for being here, by the way, and filling in.
10856841	10857261	Always appreciate it.
10857281	10857721	You're welcome.
10857741	10858381	Always a pleasure.
10858621	10858862	Thank you.
10859102	10862664	My final thought, I guess, is we need to get food because I'm hungry.
10863644	10864544	Are you getting a headache again?
10865245	10865605	Kind of.
10865645	10867246	My stomach's been kicking.
10867786	10869607	And Loki, last but not least, your final thought tonight?
10869967	10871188	Crackers need to get crackin'.
10873157	10876039	Alright, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
10876179	10880861	If you liked our show, you know all we ask you guys, tell a friend or two about the show.
10881022	10883103	We don't have advertising big dollars.
10883343	10884644	We're not a huge operation.
10884964	10886905	Word of mouth is really what keeps our show alive.
10887205	10889046	Leave us a nice review on iTunes if you could.
10889086	10890687	We haven't gotten any of those in a long time.
10890727	10891888	It's been about a month or two.
10892288	10909674	so we really appreciate those listen to Horde House if you like World of Warcraft or Blizzard stuff, HordeHouse.com and of course this is the last time we can ask you to do this so please, please write yourself a reminder ask Siri to remind you every day vote in the podcast awards for Orange Lounge Radio, best gaming podcast
10910254	10914537	Really appreciate a vote for our friends over at the Geek Spin and Podsafe Music as well.
10914657	10915197	Help us win.
10915217	10916538	That'll go a long way in promoting.
10916578	10918520	We really, really appreciate every single vote.
10918880	10922702	Even if we don't win, we have really felt a lot of love from the community, which has been great.
10922903	10927906	I've seen other podcasters retweeting and supporting us, especially the All Games family.
10927926	10936472	So I really, before we sign off tonight, want to give a heartfelt thank you to all the All Games people who have really rallied behind us in helping us to win.
10936512	10939434	And if, if, if, if, if we do win,
10940254	10945137	It will be in large part thanks to that and all of their efforts.
10945338	10947359	So really, really, really appreciate it.
10948280	10949480	So I guess that's going to do it.
10950501	10951442	We'll be back next week.
10951482	10953063	DarkSakura will be back from Disneyland.
10953103	10958046	I'm sure to tell us all about her adventures on Space Mountain, maybe at Electronica or whatever else she's been doing there.
10958366	10964310	And we'll talk about whatever else comes up in gaming with our bit of wit and sassy commentary.
10964831	10967352	Until then, be safe.
10967632	10968253	Don't be a dick.
