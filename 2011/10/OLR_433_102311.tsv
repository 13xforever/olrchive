0	19120	The PlayStation Vita has an American launch date.
19120	22680	Blizzard will throw in a free game if you commit to a year of Warcraft.
22680	31360	And updates to the 3DS firmware are detailed.
31360	34840	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show
34840	38840	where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.
38840	46800	We are live at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com with the 433rd episode of our show for this
46800	52080	October the 20, what is it today, the 23rd of 2011.
52080	55680	We do tape live every Sunday night at All Games Radio right after the Bobby Black Wolf
55680	56680	Show.
56680	59240	6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, about.
59240	63080	My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours, not sadly with
63080	65520	my awesome co-host Dark Sakura.
65520	66620	She has the night off.
66620	69480	She is en route to Anaheim right now.
69480	71880	She's going to Blizzcon a little too late.
71880	74920	No, obviously what's next door to Blizzcon?
74920	75920	Disneyland.
75920	78400	And that is the true destination for her and the hubby.
78400	81600	But joining me tonight is the one and only tech master, Loki.
81600	82600	Hello.
82600	83600	How you doing, Loki?
83600	84600	I'm doing fine.
84600	85600	Awesome.
85600	88360	So what is the perennial question for our chat room?
88360	91160	They always want to know what was dinner tonight?
91160	94480	Double Western Bacon Cheeseburger from Carl's Jr.
94480	95480	Awesome.
95480	96480	Chat.
96480	101800	Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to join us live in our chat room.
101800	108000	Joining us tonight, since Dark Sakura is not here, we do have another panelist here tonight.
108000	113100	So kind to always fill in on all the OLR network shows when there's an opening.
113100	115920	Say hello to the one and only Salacious Pop.
115920	116920	What up?
116920	118360	How you doing, Salacious Pop?
118360	119360	I'm doing alright.
119360	120360	How are you?
120360	122360	Sup?
122360	123360	I am good.
123360	124360	What's new with you?
124360	126880	How's life been treating you?
126880	127880	Fairly boring.
127880	128880	I'm around.
128880	129880	I live with you.
129880	130880	You should know.
130880	131880	You don't have to ask me that.
131880	135360	Well, this is what we call Radio Banter, where you entertain the listeners.
135360	137760	You still have a lot to learn, young one.
137760	138760	Alright.
138760	139760	Join our chat room.
139760	140760	Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
140760	145360	DDRDollarBill is in our chat room tonight saying it's an all-male review.
145360	149000	Yes, tonight is an all-male review.
149000	150320	Maybe we'll have some female callers.
150320	151320	We'll see.
151320	154560	We will take your live calls later on in the show in Part B.
154560	159840	Getting right into the video game chat tonight, Derek H. throws down the gauntlet, so to speak,
159840	160840	in our chat room.
160840	166040	OLR, I would like to invite you and your listeners to participate in the big battle racing series
166040	167760	on Forza 4.
167760	169880	Now I have heard about the big battle that's going on.
169880	174200	It's this thing that Derek does with a lot of the all-game shows, and I participated
174200	176580	in one a little while ago when it was pinball.
176580	182440	The only reservation I have is that it's Forza 4, and I really stink at the Forza series.
182440	184360	I'm usually more into the arcade racers.
184360	189680	Like if we were talking like Blur, Burnout, Mario Kart, like that's the stuff up my alley.
189680	193140	The real stuff, like Forza, Gran Turismo, I am terrible at that stuff.
193140	194640	I consistently drive in walls.
194640	196120	Are you a Forza person, Loki?
196120	198880	Would you be able to represent the OL Army?
198880	201080	I don't even have Forza.
201080	206640	I need someone to step up in our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com to participate
206640	207760	on behalf of OLR.
207760	209160	We need somebody to do it.
209160	213000	Somebody needs to show that we are not all weak when it comes to racing games.
213000	215440	But of course, when Mario Kart 7 comes out, it's on.
215440	217180	You'd play it if it was Initial D, right?
217180	218180	You love that game.
218180	219720	Yeah, as long as it had like Eurobeat in the background.
219720	220720	Or Outrun.
220720	221720	That would be awesome.
221720	223360	But see, Initial D, again, is an arcade racer.
223360	226080	And I love Midnight Maximum Tune in the arcades.
226080	228120	I'd be down with Ridge Racer.
228120	229120	Ridge Racer.
229120	230120	Ridge Racer!
230120	233680	Anyway, if you want more information on that, you want to sign up on behalf of Orange Lounge
233680	234680	Radio.
234680	237280	TheBigBattle.net.
237280	239280	So check that out.
239280	245400	And yeah, we need some helps representing Forza 4, because lord knows I can't.
245400	251680	Alright, before we get into our gaming week, I wanted to talk about this a little bit.
251680	253140	Well first, I gotta throw this out there.
253140	255240	We've been mentioning this the past couple weeks on the show.
255240	256840	I gotta reiterate this.
256840	263800	We are nominated in the 2011 Podcast Awards, www.podcastawards.com.
263800	265320	And we need your votes.
265320	267720	You can vote every day between now and the 27th.
267720	269600	We mentioned this last week on the show.
269600	271080	We don't ask a lot here at Orange Lounge Radio.
271080	273160	We don't play advertising on the show.
273160	277620	We don't ask for your money or premium subscriptions or sell any apps or anything like that.
277620	280640	So you know, if you like what you hear, all we ask is that you spread the word.
280640	282400	We say that at the end of every show.
282400	285320	And winning the award would be great for promotion.
285320	289000	And not just us, but the network we're on, it would be terrific.
289000	294140	We won the award back in 2005 when podcasting was like first, first out there.
294140	295680	And it was great promotion then.
295680	300400	But since then, a lot of corporate casts have come in and really just dominated, because
300400	304200	you know, they can put ads in their magazines and they get millions of visitors on their
304200	305200	sites.
305200	310080	So us lowly independents, you know, have struggled a lot to promote amongst that.
310080	311980	Now there's a lot of great independent shows nominated.
311980	312980	So I'm feeling pretty good.
312980	315840	At least some deserving independent will win.
315840	319860	But of course, we'd like it to be us, I'm not going to lie.
319860	326640	So please, if you enjoy Orange Lounge Radio, consider voting for us in the podcast awards.
326640	328360	Dark Sakura will be back next week too.
328360	332040	I had a little note to mention that for those that are Dark Sakura fans.
332040	334240	We will still have a classic game of the week and all that fun stuff tonight.
334240	335240	So stay tuned.
335240	339600	I want to talk about this story too before we get into the gaming weeks and the news
339600	340600	and all that.
340600	344320	And that is this interesting way that gaming maybe is changing.
344320	347920	This little kind of like blink and you miss it story came up this week and it was about
347920	348920	FIFA 12.
348920	352040	And especially for a lot of the people in our audience, I know we don't have as many
352040	356240	sports games fans, you know, because I know a lot of you guys, we started with music games,
356240	358560	a lot of you in role playing games, some of that too.
358560	362560	But certainly there's the occasional sports game that we all enjoy.
362560	368880	You know, for me, the old NBA Jam, Blades of Steel, a lot of the old school stuff.
368880	373800	But what I think is interesting about this whole FIFA 12 thing is that you can play FIFA
373800	378360	12, at least a demo of it, right, via YouTube.
378360	383080	And I guess it's like a partnership that this company Gaikai is doing with YouTube where
383080	387080	you go on and you can go to this page to visit, you know, information about FIFA 12 and you
387080	389500	can actually stream this demo.
389500	392340	You don't download anything to your computer or what have you.
392340	393340	It's like OnLife.
393340	397320	This is basically an OnLife competitor but no standalone client.
397320	399560	I guess it's all run through Java or what have you.
399560	405600	So you can go on, check out this game, and stream it and all the graphics and everything
405600	410240	through the magic of the cloud gaming and all that stuff so you're not really downloading
410240	412080	a whole lot to your computer.
412080	416640	And while this might not seem like such a big deal at first, I kind of go like, okay,
416640	419360	well, hold on a minute.
419360	426520	If this is going on YouTube, which is how we watch a lot of like movies and music videos
426520	429480	now, I mean, does MTV play music videos anymore?
429480	430480	No.
430480	431480	Sometimes.
431480	432480	Where do we get our music videos?
432480	434080	I think they have a show that does that.
434080	435880	Like one show that comes on at midnight?
435880	436880	All right.
436880	439080	Beavis and Butthead is coming back this week.
439080	440720	So that's old school.
440720	443600	That is awesome.
443600	444600	But what does this mean?
444600	446660	Do you think this could mean anything for the future of gaming?
446660	451020	Because now we've got two companies that are going into cloud gaming and later on tonight
451020	455820	we're going to get into rumors about the Xbox and whatever next is for them and then PlayStation
455820	456820	4.
456820	457820	What?
457820	460480	I mean, could this be technology that we see built into consoles?
460480	464280	Is this something that's going to go wider, do you think?
464280	469160	This kind of reminds me of that vaporware console that was announced around the time
469160	473680	the 360 and the PS3 were, which was, I believe the Phantom, if you remember that, where you
473680	478680	could sign up to sign up to get the preliminary launch announcement.
478680	479680	I do remember that.
479680	483080	And I think that's why a lot of people kind of laughed on live when it first came out.
483080	484080	Yeah.
484080	485080	And then I remember going to that E3.
485080	487640	Were you at that E3 Loki or was that the year after you went?
487640	488640	Yeah.
488640	489640	Okay.
489640	492560	Remember when on live was there on the floor and it was like, holy shit, it works.
492560	495600	Like a lot of people were like, okay, wait, where's the box?
495600	496600	What's the trick?
496600	499800	And like, that was really people's reaction to on live is holy shit, it works.
499800	503100	Now on live's biggest challenge is getting the games on the service.
503100	506320	You know, they don't really have a lot unfortunately, but it works.
506320	509940	But yeah, the Phantom and all that kind of, it wasn't so much skeptical.
509940	514480	It wasn't so much a gaming console as it was a gaming appliance, but that didn't really
514480	517960	seem like, you know, there was no way to actually load media onto it.
517960	521060	It was all kind of DS DLC or all streaming.
521060	524280	And that seems like, well, why can't you just do that on a computer once they can figure
524280	527120	out the parity between the bandwidth and the response time?
527120	528360	And it sounds like it's here.
528360	529360	So yeah.
529360	530360	I bet.
530360	532000	Do you think this is something that we could see?
532000	535820	I mean, you know, right now we have X-Box live arcade where you download these little
535820	538040	games to the console and your PlayStation network.
538040	541720	Do you think there's going to come a time where we stream games services?
541720	542720	Yeah, absolutely.
542720	547160	Because I mean, as bandwidth gets better, it's going to get even easier to stream something
547160	548480	like that.
548480	551280	And I mean, they're only a couple hundred meg at most.
551280	557100	I mean, well, some of them are like a couple gig, but you know, they have limits in size
557100	560840	and stuff to what they can put on X-Box live arcade.
560840	563320	So it would be possible to stream something like that.
563320	568000	Or if they have a way to where they could split the game up, you know, by level or whatever
568000	572400	so that you start streaming the game and as you progress through the game, you have the
572400	576480	rest of the levels are streaming in, then yeah, definitely it's something they could
576480	577480	do.
577480	582040	Plus, you know, with all the announcements like a couple weeks ago where, you know, both
582040	590840	Unreal's now being supported in web browsers and you know, also Crytek is looking at getting
590840	594800	the CryEngine in, you know, to Flash as well.
594800	599800	So you know, with that stuff coming about, yeah, I can definitely see them doing a lot
599800	604720	more gaming on demand type stuff through web browsers because I mean, that way you don't
604720	606080	even have to sell a console.
606080	609580	So that could be kind of bad news for consoles actually, if you think about it.
609580	613200	Could you imagine in the future, I mean, this might be actually a horrible thing, but maybe
613200	614200	we're already there.
614200	615200	I don't know.
615200	618780	But remember how like we would go to arcades?
618780	621920	Remember the arcade when they weren't full of ticket machines, we would go there to like
621920	623480	play against people and stuff.
623480	629760	I mean, what about a system where you deposit a virtual quarter or a token and play a game
629760	634360	streaming against, you know, play around a SoulCalibur 2 or I guess now it would be 5
634360	635840	against somebody long distance.
635840	638820	I mean, I think we're kind of already there.
638820	642520	That will work and here's why, it's because they've tried that already with like the IOS
642520	643520	stuff.
643520	647560	You have, you know, the Capcom games where you can pay a quarter to play an arcade game
647560	652020	on, you know, a handheld system or something like that and people are like, no, I'm not
652020	653020	going to do that.
653020	657860	Yeah, and IOS also sucks for gaming unless the game is built around the touchscreen.
657860	662320	Even if it was, you know, on my computer and I had a controller and stuff like that, I
662320	664520	would not pay per game.
664520	666020	No, screw that.
666020	667320	I bought the game.
667320	668320	I'm going to play the game.
668320	671480	But you used to play 50 cents per round of DDR.
671480	673120	Yeah, and that's a little bit different.
673120	674120	Or a dollar, shit.
674120	676960	Are they going to ship me some pads and ship me a nice arcade system?
676960	682240	Then yeah, well, I'll consider it then, but it's not like that.
682240	687280	You're using all my hardware and all you're doing is sending me the code for your game.
687280	690400	Well, it's being, it's being rendered offsite though, right?
690400	693560	It's just being streamed to you.
693560	695680	Like you don't need the graphics card or anything, right?
695680	696680	It's in the cloud.
696680	700400	It's all in the cloud through the magic of the cloud.
700400	701400	You know, I don't like the cloud.
701400	702400	You know what?
702400	703400	Fuck the cloud.
703400	704400	Is that what you're saying?
704400	705400	Fuck the cloud.
705400	706400	Yeah.
706400	712480	He was Final Fantasy's best antagonist and I don't know why, no, I'm kidding.
712480	715720	You know, it's kind of, you know, also kind of this whole discussion about arcades and
715720	719540	things makes you think, and it makes me kind of sad is that are we ever going to have anything
719540	721120	like DDR ever again?
721120	724720	And I don't mean like the game itself, but I mean kind of like the community that that
724720	730360	built, which includes this show, which started nine years ago, guitar hero and rock band,
730360	731360	right?
731360	732360	And that's even, that's kind of came and went.
732360	733360	That's not what I mean though.
733360	737640	I'm talking about we used to go to the arcade to celebrate people's birthdays and sit around
737640	740720	the fourth mix machine and watch people fuck off.
740720	745360	The problem is it's not profitable as much for arcades anymore to have that kind of stuff
745360	746760	in their arcades.
746760	751180	So you, what you need to do is you need to have arcades that really just want that there
751180	754200	and find a way to become profitable as well.
754200	758440	How do you get people to leave the couch when it's so easy now to click button play game?
758440	762520	Well, I think it's, I mean, you still can't emulate everything that you can do in the
762520	763520	arcade.
763520	767880	I mean, the experiences in the arcade are still going to be vastly superior as far as,
767880	769960	you know, controls go.
769960	773400	I mean, arcade sticks and stuff like that, yeah, definitely supplement that, but not
773400	776440	everyone's buying that and it's still, you know, fun to play in the arcade.
776440	780640	But the problem is, yeah, a lot of people are playing stuff that they could play in
780640	784800	the arcade at home, like fighting games and racing games and stuff like that.
784800	788440	But yeah, dancing games and stuff, I don't think that's really something you can emulate
788440	789440	at home.
789440	790440	Yeah.
790440	791440	You know, they've danced in revolution.
791440	794000	I'm not even necessarily talking about a dancing game or a music game.
794000	796800	I'm just talking about a game that establishes such a sense of community.
796800	800200	The closest thing I can think of that I see now is maybe like some of the racing games.
800200	803800	Like, I do still see, like, Initial D has a pretty big contingent in the racing games
803800	804800	in the arcade.
804800	805800	There's, there's...
805800	807760	Fighting, of course fighting games, of course fighting games.
807760	808760	There's still communities.
808760	809760	But it's not as big as it used to be.
809760	813560	Well, there's still communities out there, but they're spread out or they're, you know,
813560	815160	on Facebook or something like that.
815160	820480	I mean, go to any, you know, gaming Facebook page and there's tons of people that are fans
820480	823300	of that game on there talking about stuff.
823300	827680	You know, if you want to get people excited about something at the arcade, you make it
827680	833200	arcade only, you make a reason for people to go there constantly, just, you know, whether
833200	841440	it be, you know, unlocking stuff on the machine or just some unique style of gameplay and
841440	842440	people will go there.
842440	846460	People will be, you know, have fun, create communities around it.
846460	850960	It's just, unfortunately, you know, like Dance Dance Revolution started really much as an
850960	856480	arcade game and yeah, there were some of the Japanese versions, but for a long time, that's
856480	860200	all there was, was the arcade and that's why people would go there and then they formed
860200	861200	a community around it.
861200	864240	But then once they started coming out with a lot more home versions, yeah, you don't
864240	866160	really necessarily need to go to the arcade anymore.
866160	868920	Yeah, but the home versions had crap songs for the longest time.
868920	869920	Yes, that's true.
869920	873360	But then also a lot of the people grew up and they just decided.
873360	874360	We all turned 30.
874360	875360	Shit.
875360	878440	They just decided, you know, I've got a lot more things going on.
878440	882280	I can't really make it out to the arcade to go play games.
882280	889920	I mean, it's just, you know, time, you know, do I go drive, you know, 10 minutes, 15 minutes
889920	895000	or whatever to my arcade to go hang out by myself, you know, or.
895000	900340	I think my, my mind was kind of going in this direction because I'd heard something, well,
900340	903120	a DDR Freak officially closed this week.
903120	906320	I mean, I know we had the talk a couple of weeks ago about how DDR Freak was closing
906320	909880	and the server was offline, but the server came back up for J-Dog to post a message that
909880	914680	said it's over, like the whole epilogue and the forums are locked down because of spam
914680	915680	and everything.
915680	916680	It is officially done.
916680	917680	Game over.
917680	918680	Failed.
918680	919680	You know, that whole thing.
919680	920680	So I don't know.
920680	921920	It kind of had me thinking about the whole DDR and the community and all that because,
921920	922920	you know, it was shit.
922920	924400	We've been playing that game like 10 years.
924400	929040	Yeah, but there's, that was one site and that's like kind of what it was.
929040	930040	Let's be real.
930040	931040	I get it.
931040	934200	DDR is not dead and you know, it will always be a fitness school type thing, whatever.
934200	937480	But like DDR Freak was the community for a long time.
937480	942560	It was a community for a long time and then like 10 years ago it stopped being the community
942560	948280	where everyone went and there's other communities out there and those communities are still
948280	950760	live and just doing fine.
950760	953920	You know, I'd heard rumors about speaking of arcades, communities, all that, the rumors
953920	960100	about a DDR get together for the 20th of November, which I think is supposed to be a Sunday,
960100	963040	but I haven't heard anything about if that's actually happening or not, but I think it
963040	964040	should.
964040	967720	I mean, if they're not going to organize something, I think we should.
967720	968720	I don't know.
968720	971720	I'll just have to, I'll have to find out and find out fast.
971720	972720	That's only what?
972720	973720	Like four weeks away?
973720	974720	Something like that.
974720	976280	So don't have a lot of time.
976280	977280	There's no time.
977280	978280	All right.
978280	979520	Uh, let's move on.
979520	983520	Um, let me get a couple more comments from our chat room at chat.orangelandsready.com.
983520	987560	Derek H I think is trying to play this FIFA demo online and brings up an interesting point
987560	989040	about just how easy this all is.
989040	992520	Derek H says, this FIFA thing is stalled at starting game.
992520	993700	Please wait a moment.
993700	995800	Now I got to upgrade Java and the download failed.
995800	999040	I think it would have been faster if they just let me download the demo.
999040	1002360	I don't like guy guy.
1002360	1004200	And um, that's a pretty good point.
1004200	1007560	You know, as simple as this all might be, push button play game.
1007560	1010800	Doesn't always work.
1010800	1013080	It's not always that easy.
1013080	1017240	And really, I mean, yeah, the technology is cool and it might be fun to check it out because
1017240	1019760	of the technology, but I don't give a crap about FIFA.
1019760	1021600	I just don't.
1021600	1025520	And I figure, you know, if I'm going to play a FIFA demo, I have a 360, I can download
1025520	1029560	the demo for that, but it's FIFA now, but it might be another game later on that you
1029560	1030560	are interested in.
1030560	1031560	Right?
1031560	1032560	Yeah.
1032560	1035860	I think the genre of games that really stands out to me is that could really take advantage
1035860	1040520	of this are free to play MMOs where you don't have to bog down your system with a bunch
1040520	1041600	of crap to install it.
1041600	1045800	You just log into a portal and it's all streamed to you because that's a great way to get the
1045800	1048320	soccer moms or whatever to play because they don't need a graphics card.
1048320	1049840	It's all rendered off site.
1049840	1054920	So free MMOs and game demos, I could see really taking advantage of this, but for the kind
1054920	1058440	of games that we like to play, I don't know, like Arkham City or whatever, you're going
1058440	1063440	to need an installation on a local device, whether it's a console or PC, but I think
1063440	1067520	for free, for free MMOs or freemium, this is great technology.
1067520	1072480	All right, well, we're going to move on into our gaming weeks and the stuff that we've
1072480	1073480	been playing this week.
1073480	1074480	A couple other quick, quick announcements.
1074480	1077720	I forgot to get this out there earlier, but I see some of you guys in chat room are like,
1077720	1079160	I'm voting in the podcast awards.
1079160	1080160	Okay.
1080160	1081160	So thank you guys so much for doing that.
1081160	1085200	I did want to mention one of the other members of the OL army, Brad from pod culture has
1085200	1089000	a show in his network that's nominated and we want to throw our support behind him.
1089000	1093400	He is with a show called the geek spin and it's nominated in pod safe music.
1093400	1095280	I think it might just be called music in the awards.
1095280	1096280	I can't remember.
1096280	1097840	It's either pod safe, it's pod safe.
1097840	1098960	Loki's been voting for it every day.
1098960	1100580	So it's, it's the geek spin.
1100580	1103240	And so, you know, as you're filling out your ballot, cause you can vote in one category,
1103240	1107040	you can vote multiple, we would, you know, unless there's just some other pod safe music
1107040	1109440	podcasts you just really freaking love.
1109440	1112080	We'd appreciate if you'd throw your support to a fellow member of the OL army.
1112080	1115680	If we can't win, maybe he can, that would be pretty cool.
1115680	1117260	I think that was it.
1117260	1120840	So let's move on to our gaming weeks and the video games that you have been playing this
1120840	1121840	week.
1121840	1124200	Salacious Pop, we'll start with you.
1124200	1126800	Mostly world of Warcraft, of course.
1126800	1129280	And I guessed it on your other podcast to talk about that.
1129280	1134220	So we'll get to it in a minute, but obviously lots of big world of Warcraft news came out.
1134220	1135520	So I played a lot of that.
1135520	1137960	It's in the middle of the Halloween holiday.
1137960	1143920	I also had an opportunity to play on the PS3, your Sega Genesis arcade collection.
1143920	1148840	I was playing a lot of Dr. Robotnik's Bean Bean Machine because someone had commented
1148840	1154220	on how fucking hard that game is because I know it's, it's a licensed clone of POPO.
1154220	1155280	It's not really our Puyo Puyo.
1155280	1156280	It's not really rip off.
1156280	1158720	They, they just reskinned it with their permission.
1158720	1159720	Yeah.
1159720	1161080	That and Kirby's Avalanche came out at the same time.
1161080	1163760	So I don't know if the same company had done them or what the deal is, but yeah.
1163760	1164760	Yeah.
1164760	1170800	And that is, I got to the fourth or fifth stage, you know, with only having to do each
1170800	1175660	retry like once or twice, but yeah, that game is hard and the Streets of Rage 2 and a bunch
1175660	1177660	of other stuff.
1177660	1181380	And uh, isn't that game a really good deal for like 20 bucks because that's what it goes
1181380	1182620	for now is 20 bucks.
1182620	1185560	Just a little mini rant because I know you like those.
1185560	1190380	What I love about the Genesis, the Sonic's best of Genesis collection is that there is
1190380	1195460	some production and polish in how it looks when you load up the disc, but it's mostly
1195460	1197420	just a list.
1197420	1199660	Here are the ROMs that are on this.
1199660	1203420	Here's a nice, pretty, you know, background screen to list everything out in.
1203420	1207260	And then you just pick the game that you want and it loads up.
1207260	1214700	Unlike another collection that we had an opportunity to play, which was the Namco, uh, the Namco
1214700	1220540	Museum Megamix, where you load that up and you play a little 3D Pac-Man avatar and you
1220540	1224440	have to jump over little platforms to get to the building that the ROM that you want
1224440	1225440	to play it in.
1225440	1228340	By the way, I looked at game FAQs, like you remember how there's all those power pellets
1228340	1231940	everywhere and it's like, Ooh, I wonder what game you unlock if you eat them all, right?
1231940	1234300	I looked on a game FAQ to see what you get.
1234300	1235300	Nothing.
1235300	1236300	It's all for show.
1236300	1237300	It is.
1237300	1238300	It means nothing.
1238300	1242940	And maybe I'm just an old curmudgeon now, but I know there's a lot of controversy about
1242940	1247820	repackaging retro content for a $40 disc when it's just shit that you played when you were
1247820	1253420	15 or however young, you know, in the nineties on your Sega Genesis, releasing that content
1253420	1254420	on a disc.
1254420	1255420	Just give me a menu.
1255420	1259340	Show me that you put some effort into packaging it and just let me, just let me pick it from
1259340	1260340	a list.
1260340	1261340	I'm easy to please.
1261340	1264020	You know, and if they want to do the frou-frou stuff, fine, but they should have like an
1264020	1265020	easy way.
1265020	1269020	And another thing I liked about the Genesis collection was that versus the Namco Megamix,
1269020	1274060	the Genesis collection has the extra interviews, it has arcade games you can unlock.
1274060	1278340	There's things that you can work towards that aren't like just, you know, too distracting
1278340	1279340	or terrible.
1279340	1280340	You know what I mean?
1280340	1281340	Yeah.
1281340	1282340	So yeah.
1282340	1285920	So loading up the Namco museum and direct Pac-Man to find the game that you want that's
1285920	1288600	in one of these candy shaped buildings.
1288600	1291700	There's also one other big difference between the Megamix and the Sega Genesis collection
1291700	1292700	to be fair.
1292700	1295660	And that is that they have all these new versions of games.
1295660	1300760	Like one of the ones I played was Rally-X, which has now Pac-Man in the car dodging,
1300760	1305540	not ghosts, but just boogers, just boogers and other cars.
1305540	1309620	And it's kind of like a 3D version of Rally-X, which kind of ruins the charm of the original
1309620	1310620	game.
1310620	1316860	Like old school 2D games from 1983 don't translate well into 3D on the Wii if you don't change
1316860	1317860	a lot.
1317860	1318860	You know what I mean?
1318860	1322020	Like it's just, the whole thing felt derpy to me.
1322020	1325900	And I want to give a shout out to a DDR dollar bill in chat because he said that his gaming
1325900	1333100	week with City of Heroes and they just launched their freemium free to play model, which included
1333100	1337140	the cataclysm like redesign of the starter zones.
1337140	1339000	Maybe a minor graphical upgrade.
1339000	1343020	So I'm not really in a situation where I can check that out right now, but I'm just City
1343020	1344020	of Heroes love.
1344020	1345020	I played that game for years.
1345020	1346020	I'm surprised.
1346020	1347020	Why aren't you getting into that?
1347020	1348020	Is it just too much?
1348020	1349020	Wow.
1349020	1350020	Or it's free.
1350020	1351020	It runs on your computer, right?
1351020	1352020	Yeah.
1352020	1353860	I'm surprised you're not checking it out.
1353860	1357140	Let me ask you this question too before you wrap up your gaming week because unlike the
1357140	1361060	other show, the people that listen to this show, not everybody's into WoW.
1361060	1363540	In fact, some people quite frankly hate it.
1363540	1366060	So why do you play WoW?
1366060	1370700	Well, what got me onto WoW originally was finding out how many gamer friends that I
1370700	1375120	never really got to see in FaceTime were already playing on a certain server and it was the
1375120	1376980	social aspect of it.
1376980	1382940	So being able to interact with people that I know and it's very immersive.
1382940	1384580	There's definitely stuff to do.
1384580	1387820	It's the industry leader for subscriptions for a reason even though that's dwindling
1387820	1390940	which we'll get to in a minute with a future story.
1390940	1397500	But I played the hell out of Warcraft 3 and I knew I played the RTS campaign where the
1397500	1400220	Scourge is there and Lich King and blah, blah, blah.
1400220	1405740	So I didn't hop onto the WoW train immediately because I was still playing City of Heroes
1405740	1407700	to be honest, so.
1407700	1408700	Alright.
1408700	1409700	Loki!
1409700	1410700	Oh, I'm sorry.
1410700	1412220	I'm assuming that was everything, right?
1412220	1413220	Yes.
1413220	1414220	Okay.
1414220	1415220	Loki, how was your gaming week?
1415220	1416220	I only played Grand Theft Auto.
1416220	1417220	That's it?
1417220	1418580	Yeah, it's pretty much it.
1418580	1421700	I didn't get in time to play much of anything else.
1421700	1430780	I don't think I played any Dead Rising 2 off the record this week.
1430780	1433780	Gosh, you make it sound like you have a baby or something that takes all your time.
1433780	1437420	Uh, no, actually it wasn't the baby that took all my time, it was modding Grand Theft Auto
1437420	1438420	that took all my time.
1438420	1439420	Modding Grand Theft Auto?
1439420	1440420	What are you doing to Grand Theft Auto right now?
1440420	1448100	Uh, just discovering new stuff, new techniques on how to do things, and uh, that really occupied
1448100	1449100	all my time.
1449100	1451440	Alright, um, let's see.
1451440	1456780	My gaming week, I was playing Warcraft as well because you guys all know I'm into that.
1456780	1460660	Final Fantasy XIV, I'm still kind of juggling the two games a little bit, you know, and
1460660	1463140	I stand by what I said about the game last week.
1463140	1466140	It's getting better, but there's still a lot of room for improvement and I'm probably not
1466140	1470580	going to pay for it unless some miracle patch makes the game really.
1470580	1476100	And I think a lot of what is ruining Final Fantasy XIV for me the more I play it is that
1476100	1482180	I see how other MMOs, including WoW, like to put in a lot of quality of life improvements,
1482180	1487300	but I feel like the Japanese developers have no concept of what a quality of life improvement
1487300	1488300	is.
1488300	1490940	I mean, I'm talking about like games I see developed over there versus games I see developed
1490940	1491940	over here.
1491940	1496140	It is that, you know, in order to do certain quests and stuff, I spend ten minutes running
1496140	1501260	from point A to point B, and that's just, how is that fun to just run?
1501260	1505020	You know, so I think if they are going to redesign their game, they really need to think
1505020	1510220	about how do we make the game non-stop fun?
1510220	1513940	That's the thing, because when the game's good, it's pretty good.
1513940	1517500	Like you know, the battle systems actually, it's really neat to look at, it's different,
1517500	1520540	you have to think about positioning of your characters as well as what you're doing, you
1520540	1524060	know, it's very much unlike WoW, and I like that, it makes a nice break from WoW, and
1524060	1530940	the storytelling is awesome, and the cutscenes are great, but when the game is in its downtime,
1530940	1533220	it's dead time, it's really dead.
1533220	1537720	You know, if I didn't have a link shell of people to talk to, I would poke my eyes out
1537720	1541500	from boredom, and so I hope the developers are really going to think about how the game
1541500	1545340	can be thrilling for ten minutes as opposed to every ten minutes.
1545340	1550260	It sort of reminds me of the argument of what Japanese gamers want versus American gamers
1550260	1555780	especially with JRPGs and how they're kind of tedious and min-max-y and how they just
1555780	1558940	supposedly love that over there, whereas here we're more...
1558940	1560540	I kind of think that's a cop-out.
1560540	1564540	Like I don't think people here truly understand what people like over there, and you know,
1564540	1565540	vice versa.
1565540	1570060	Like I think sometimes people make excuses, like, oh it's a cultural thing, it's a cultural
1570060	1571060	thing.
1571060	1572060	I don't know.
1572060	1577460	Yeah, because I heard that those lineage MMOs, which are huge over in that part of the world,
1577460	1582300	are very kind of dry to play, like the grinding that you have to do.
1582300	1584980	But again, I've never played it, so I'm mostly talking out of my ass, but...
1584980	1588380	And I wonder if it's one of those things again where kind of like you and WoW, you know,
1588380	1591060	your friends are there so you just play it, it's your thing.
1591060	1596060	You know, if all my friends suddenly dropped WoW and went to Final Fantasy XIV, I'd have
1596060	1599820	to reconsider what I'm saying, because at least in my ten minutes of run, run, run,
1599820	1603080	run, run, run, run, run, run, run, all over the place, which is what, when Salacious
1603080	1605340	Pop sees me playing Final Fantasy XIV, that's what he does.
1605340	1609780	Because you play a little spriteling hobbit halfling little...
1609780	1610780	Lalafell.
1610780	1611780	Lalafell.
1611780	1614540	So it's this cute little munchkin thing, and his little legs kick when he runs, and he
1614540	1617220	does a lot of running to run from town to town.
1617220	1622860	So I see his little wiggly legs tearing across the countryside, and run, run, run, run, run,
1622860	1624020	run, run, run.
1624020	1625020	So.
1625020	1626020	Alright.
1626020	1627020	Anyhow.
1627020	1630740	A question from our chat room before I talk about one more game I played this week.
1630740	1635000	Hitstun in our chat room asks, oh yeah, how did Skylander's sales do this week in Dark
1635000	1636000	Tetsuya?
1636000	1638260	I was disappointed that Loki didn't play Skylander's this week.
1638260	1640340	So what's up with Skylander's?
1640340	1647420	I don't have any sales data yet, and I was just checking on that, because VG Charts only
1647420	1651480	has up through the 15th, and they came out on the 16th, so there's nothing yet.
1651480	1652480	So we'll know soon.
1652480	1656700	But based on the report I heard last week from a retail person, I mean, this is one
1656700	1659340	retail person in one store, but it seems to be selling well.
1659340	1662580	But then again, I went to Target, and I saw plenty of copies of the game and all the little
1662580	1668620	dollies, which I gotta admit, there was a moment where I kinda went, oh that might actually
1668620	1669620	be kind of fun.
1669620	1675700	And then I just heard Loki in my brain going, no!
1675700	1676700	Listen.
1676700	1678860	Uh oh.
1678860	1681740	Do I have to explain to you what this game is?
1681740	1686660	You don't, but for the behalf of the listeners who would love to hear you explain it, please.
1686660	1688420	Okay, well here's how it is.
1688420	1690740	This whole game is just to sell toys.
1690740	1692620	That's all it is.
1692620	1696820	Yeah, it's a neat concept where, you know, it's kind of a hack and slash, reminds me
1696820	1700580	of Gauntlet Legends, you know, that's kinda cool, you know, I like it.
1700580	1701980	Gauntlet Legends is pretty badass.
1701980	1704660	It's a pretty badass game, you know, that's awesome.
1704660	1708460	I didn't need to buy little toys to play Gauntlet Legends, so I do appreciate that.
1708460	1710620	But you did need a Dreamcast.
1710620	1713460	Or the arcade.
1713460	1715420	But here's the thing.
1715420	1718300	This game is specifically made to sell toys.
1718300	1723100	I mean, if you don't believe it, play the game.
1723100	1725540	Play the game, okay, seriously.
1725540	1732420	You start off with three figures, and it's three different elements, I guess.
1732420	1734460	There's a total of eight different elements in the game.
1734460	1740540	In order to see everything in the game, you have to buy all eight elements.
1740540	1745100	And so you only have three characters to start off with, so that's, you know, another $40
1745100	1747600	you gotta spend to see everything that's in the game.
1747600	1752020	Of course, then you also have to buy the expansions to see what's in there as well, so that's
1752020	1754780	another, you know, $40 on top of that.
1754780	1756820	So $80 right there.
1756820	1757820	And if you-
1757820	1760780	But to be fair, I mean, there's a lot of video games that have download content, and if you
1760780	1764020	want to see it all, quote unquote, you know, all the levels and stuff-
1764020	1767580	Okay, that's fair, that a lot of games have download content.
1767580	1772900	But to see everything on the disc, I don't have to spend another $40.
1772900	1778360	Which is, you know, $40 on top of a game that's already too expensive as it is.
1778360	1784460	And then, on top of that, you know, to entice kids to beg their parents for more characters,
1784460	1787740	you can unlock abilities for characters you don't own.
1787740	1792460	And then, it basically shows you a preview video of how awesome that character is and
1792460	1794180	how badly you need it.
1794180	1795820	And so-
1795820	1796820	It's to get kids.
1796820	1797820	It's to get kids.
1797820	1798820	Mommy, mommy, mommy.
1798820	1799820	I want, I want, I want.
1799820	1800820	Exactly.
1800820	1804620	I want more fucking targets looking for this figurine for Skylanders, and I can't find
1804620	1805620	it.
1805620	1806620	Right?
1806620	1807620	Because you have to find the toy.
1807620	1809300	And, and, you know, and I see a lot of-
1809300	1813380	Thank God Oprah's not still on, because I could just see her going out to her audience,
1813380	1815500	we're giving you Skylanders!
1815500	1820660	And, and I see a lot of these blogging sites or whatever talking about how expensive it
1820660	1825420	would be to buy everything, and how it's like $300 or something like that.
1825420	1827700	Yeah, you're right, up to a point.
1827700	1828860	That's wave one.
1828860	1832300	That's just the first fucking, you know, stuff that's available right now.
1832300	1834980	We haven't even talked about, like, stuff that's gonna be wave two or three.
1834980	1836980	Series two, coming spring 2012.
1836980	1842900	Seriously, you think that they're only gonna be limited to just 30 characters or whatever?
1842900	1846100	Oh, you know, you are wrong, sir.
1846100	1847940	Gotta catch them all.
1847940	1850740	Going to our chat room, and I apologize if I'm mispronouncing this name, I think it's
1850740	1851740	Zezby?
1851740	1852740	Zeezby?
1852740	1857060	Uh, in our chat room, uh, says, my mom bought this for my eight-year-old brother for his
1857060	1858060	birthday.
1858060	1859300	I tried to get her to return it.
1859300	1862580	I then cried because she is now a tool and I can't prevent it.
1862580	1863580	Well, here's the thing.
1863580	1866260	I don't have a problem with people buying download content for the game.
1866260	1869940	If this was, say, for example, a game that didn't have any toys whatsoever, and they
1869940	1875020	had a total of 30 characters, but each one cost a buck on, you know, the PlayStation
1875020	1879860	or, yeah, that would still be stupid, but buying a character for a dollar, not that
1879860	1880860	bad.
1880860	1886260	Buying a stupid inanimate object that's $8 and it doesn't do anything, and I saw a lot
1886260	1892340	of, like, you know, Kotaku, gotta love them, but, you know, one of their excuses is, well,
1892340	1893500	see, these toys are awesome!
1893500	1897140	My kids are playing chess with them!
1897140	1898140	Your kids are weird.
1898140	1899700	You can play chess with a Dixie Cup.
1899700	1900700	Exactly!
1900700	1902300	You can play chess with anything!
1902300	1904540	You can play chess with the pieces that come with it!
1904540	1905580	Oh my God!
1905580	1906580	That's just amazing!
1906580	1913540	Um, yeah, so, good for you that your kids have found, you know, ways to use your toys
1913540	1919860	that you got for free from Activision anyways, so congratulations, but it's just, it's seriously
1919860	1924260	a cash grab, and if it's successful, you can bet that there's gonna be more of this shit
1924260	1925260	later on.
1925260	1928940	I don't need another 30 minute opening segment about Skylanders, so can I move on and talk
1928940	1930260	about the last game of my week?
1930260	1934980	Let's talk about Cash Grab 2, bargain basement game that's pretty good for your value, and
1934980	1938540	it's seriously right up the frickin' alley of the people that listen to this show, at
1938540	1941980	least the ones, you know, that started with us and all that, because it's a music-based
1941980	1942980	game.
1942980	1946740	The game I bought this week on Steam, that just went on sale, I believe, over the weekend,
1946740	1954140	is a game called Sequence, and it is, get this, it's a DDR role-playing game.
1954140	1959380	It's DDR, but not like the actual DDR game, but it's that whole idea, the falling arrows,
1959380	1964120	mixed with a role-playing game, and it's $4.50 right now on Steam, which I think the regular
1964120	1965120	price is gonna be $5.
1965120	1968540	I also believe, if I remember correctly, it's also an Xbox indie game.
1968540	1969540	It is.
1969540	1974540	It's not live indie game, but once the Cthulhu people went over to Steam and were like, shit,
1974540	1980740	we made more money in a day on Steam, I'm sure Sequence was probably already in negotiations
1980740	1984940	to get their game on Steam, and fine, because, I don't know, I wanted to play it on my computer,
1984940	1985940	and I just, I did.
1985940	1986940	I bought it there.
1986940	1989340	And so, okay, let me try to explain the setup for you guys.
1989340	1996420	So imagine if you had three Dance Dance Revolution play fields that you had to play all at once,
1996420	1999180	and you would use buttons to switch between the play fields.
1999180	2001500	So Rock Band for the DS or the PSP.
2001500	2006900	Okay, kind of, I guess you could say, except, like, one won't stop just because you get
2006900	2008500	a perfect note pattern in one.
2008500	2011380	One of them is for defending or preventing damage.
2011380	2012980	One of them is for casting spells.
2012980	2015440	One of them is for regening mana for your spells.
2015440	2018940	And the way it all works together, I gotta admit, is really cool.
2018940	2023140	Like, the whole design of the game is, it's something kinda new.
2023140	2028020	It's mixing two genres together that I think people are into, and I think for people that
2028020	2032620	enjoy music games or old playing games, like, you've gotta see what they've done here.
2032620	2036640	It is a $5 game, and so it has the production values of a $5 game.
2036640	2041540	Some of the voice acting is a little, leaves some things to be desired.
2041540	2043900	But the writing is actually, it's very witty.
2043900	2047700	It's a very witty, you can tell there's a lot of inspiration from, like, GLaDOS.
2047700	2051220	It's very modern, the game.
2051220	2053620	So I like kinda what they've done with that.
2053620	2057140	And it's not that, I'm not, like, criticizing the voice actors, I'm just saying the way
2057140	2061280	the voice acting is delivered, it really sounds like the two were recorded, like, at least
2061280	2067100	in the stages I've played, the intercom gal and the main character that you play, it's
2067100	2071360	kinda obvious the two were recorded separately, because they don't ever talk on top of each
2071360	2072360	other.
2072360	2074540	They don't have a natural interaction with each other.
2074540	2078180	And maybe I'm just kinda picky when it comes to stuff like that, but I just, you know,
2078180	2079900	I noticed it.
2079900	2083260	But I'm not gonna say, like, oh my god, the game is, like, worthless because the voice
2083260	2086180	acting was not done professionally.
2086180	2092500	No, it's the game itself, it's neat, and it's the kinda thing where I go, I really wanna
2092500	2095580	see what they're gonna do with this sequel.
2095580	2099660	Because you know, again, when I say roleplaying game, unfortunately there's no overworld,
2099660	2103260	there's no map, it's just you kinda choose from a menu.
2103260	2105340	Do you wanna go out and battle another creature?
2105340	2109560	Do you wanna work on synthesis to get more items so you are, you know, better defended
2109560	2110820	and have more hit points?
2110820	2115940	Or do you wanna work on, you know, what kinda stuff do you wanna do from within this room?
2115940	2119940	So I feel like with this concept, there's so much more that can be done with it if people
2119940	2122220	will just throw money at it.
2122220	2127100	If somebody will invest and get them more help, it'll be great.
2127100	2130400	So like, sequence two I think will be really cool if they end up making one.
2130400	2132020	But sequence one is worth your time.
2132020	2135220	The only other thing I guess I could say that might be a slight bit of a negative is that
2135220	2142080	the music is not, you know, it's not gonna be DDR style music, but I did like the music.
2142080	2147780	It's kinda, you know, it's not really like pop music or anything like that.
2147780	2153620	It's very like video gamey, you know, kinda indie artist type stuff, but it's not bad
2153620	2154620	by any means.
2154620	2160420	And you know, because my brain is still preoccupied, I tell you, it takes a lot to like be thinking
2160420	2164380	in the concept of, okay, I'm playing over here and oh shit, I see an arrow coming down
2164380	2167380	here on the damage, so I gotta flip over, hit that one, then I gotta go back and hit
2167380	2168380	my arrows to cast a spell.
2168380	2171140	I mean, your brain is kinda thinking all these things that you're not really absorbing the
2171140	2172860	music like you would in DDR.
2172860	2173860	So I don't know.
2173860	2176940	But yeah, I really like the setup of the game.
2176940	2180660	So it's neat and I would check it out if you have 450 to spare.
2180660	2184500	Sadly, I don't think there's a demo, but there might be on the indie games marketplace.
2184500	2189580	I would assume there's something there on Xbox Live, but again, I played it on PC.
2189580	2190740	So check it out.
2190740	2192660	That's sequence.
2192660	2195920	Alright, that does it for our gaming weeks.
2195920	2199620	So I wanna quickly plug a few Orange Lounge Radio related things and that would be our
2199620	2200620	Facebook.
2200620	2203300	If you're not our friend on Facebook, why not?
2203300	2204660	Don't you wanna have another friend?
2204660	2208860	Orange Lounge Radio, Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio is the place to add us on Facebook.
2208860	2212260	You can also follow us on the Twitters, Twitter.com slash O-L-R.
2212260	2216960	We will be taking your Twitter comments a little later on in the show, Twitter.com slash
2216960	2221340	O-L-R if you wanna send us some app messages with your thoughts on anything, sorry, Loki,
2221340	2224420	anything you're hearing about on tonight's program.
2224420	2226700	Let's get into some news.
2226700	2229240	Loki's gonna start us off tonight.
2229240	2234580	So the PlayStation Vita's got a release date now for Europe and North America and I guess
2234580	2237060	the Middle East and Australia.
2237060	2238060	February 22nd.
2238060	2243620	It's kinda hot, that's a Wednesday on release date, but yeah.
2243620	2244620	It'll be coming out.
2244620	2251940	Of course, they are quick to remind you that it's $249.99 without 3G and $299.99 with 3G.
2251940	2259700	Honestly, I'd just stick without 3G and tether to my phone if I really want 3G, although
2259700	2261020	I don't think I'll ever.
2261020	2265220	But Loki, I must game on the go.
2265220	2268500	I mean, it's a good idea if you want to do 3G.
2268500	2274420	I just don't know what the data plans are with that and 3G stuff, you know, have they
2274420	2275620	really announced?
2275620	2280860	Is this something where I can take it to any provider that has 3G and say, hey, I want
2280860	2289100	my PlayStation Vita to run on your service, because this isn't like the iPhone or anything
2289100	2293900	where hey, certain places will give it to you.
2293900	2296980	And also, the other thing you might want to wait and see is if they do have some sort
2296980	2302420	of data plan, a lot of times usually with the iPads and phones and stuff like that,
2302420	2306380	they'll offer you some sort of discount on the system, so you might want to wait and
2306380	2311140	see what the providers announce.
2311140	2315660	Some new launch titles have also been announced, coming from Namco, of course.
2315660	2322300	Ridge Racer, Ridge Racer, serving the launches of systems since the beginning of time.
2322300	2328940	Shinobidou and Touch My Katamari.
2328940	2331900	Those will be coming alongside the Vita in North America.
2331900	2333300	Touch My Katamari, really?
2333300	2339900	Yeah, I believe that's actually coming out already, well, obviously the Vita is launching
2339900	2344780	a little bit earlier in Japan, but I believe it's also with their launch as well.
2344780	2347500	Is that a bowling minigame I see there?
2347500	2349820	I don't think it's a minigame, I think it's just bowling pins.
2349820	2351140	Part of what you roll up?
2351140	2352140	Roll up.
2352140	2353140	That's cute.
2353140	2354700	I like Katamari.
2354700	2356340	I play that.
2356340	2361980	Yeah, I mean, the Katamari franchise has been kind of meh ever since the creator left, but
2361980	2368980	I don't know, you never know, there might always be that Renaissance Katamari game that's
2368980	2370180	a lot of fun again.
2370180	2373980	The one on PlayStation 3 wasn't bad, but it was also kind of a rehash of all the old games.
2373980	2376900	It was like a Best Hits of Katamari.
2376900	2381860	Knowing Namco, I wouldn't be surprised if this is a rehash of a rehash of a rehash of
2381860	2385340	a rehash.
2385340	2387140	So who knows?
2387140	2391140	But it's kind of neat.
2391140	2392740	Do you think you're going to get one of these at launch?
2392740	2393740	I know I am.
2393740	2395380	I really don't have a choice.
2395380	2400140	I'd like to, but it all depends on how much money you got, but I think I could probably
2400140	2402620	scrounge up that kind of dough.
2402620	2405500	I will definitely be setting the money aside to get it.
2405500	2407020	I gotta have it.
2407020	2410540	I just, you know, the reason I want it is because I think they're going to do a Grand
2410540	2415180	Theft Auto game for it, and I gotta have a Grand Theft Auto game.
2415180	2418660	Grand Theft Auto on PSP, we were kind of talking about it, especially since they've
2418660	2423500	been showing the Grand Theft Auto 3 stuff, it's like, man, it'd be fun to go back and
2423500	2430300	play Liberty City Stories again, but that game is really old, and it would be such a
2430300	2431980	learning curve again.
2431980	2436180	Salacious Pop, how do you feel about the PlayStation Vita?
2436180	2440420	Like, I know you don't exactly probably want to run out and buy one day one, but let's
2440420	2443260	say you had the disposable income.
2443260	2445580	Is this something that calls to you?
2445580	2446580	Absolutely.
2446580	2447580	It's a sexy piece of hardware.
2447580	2448580	I like how it looks.
2448580	2452460	I didn't know you felt so strongly about it.
2452460	2453460	No, it's like...
2453460	2456820	Do you have feelings for the PlayStation Vita?
2456820	2462420	The PSP for me was, I think it's an underrated piece of hardware, because the DS, of course,
2462420	2467380	just mud stomped everything in the handheld market, and the PSP is a competent little
2467380	2470340	nice device that displays well and is a great system.
2470340	2476820	I think the Vita, again, is going to be a nice piece of technology, but the 3DS hasn't
2476820	2479780	really started to wreck people yet.
2479780	2482660	Here's the thing about the 3DS, too.
2482660	2488140	We don't really know, aside from the ever-delayed Kid Icarus, what's really their plan beyond
2488140	2489380	2011.
2489380	2494300	It's just like, hey, we got Kid Icarus, because that's been delayed forever.
2494300	2498940	They've got the two Mario games that are going to be coming out this holiday, but they haven't
2498940	2501180	really said too much.
2501180	2505940	There was stuff at E3 and some other conference, but I don't remember any of that damn shit.
2505940	2509420	So since they're not keeping it fresh in my mind, that makes me think that they don't
2509420	2516060	really have a plan, and they're really going to need a plan when the Vita comes out, because
2516060	2518980	people may think otherwise by buying a system.
2518980	2526500	We do have expansion firmware-related news coming up later, and it's upgrades.
2526500	2528160	It's upgrades from what's there now.
2528160	2532860	One thing that I think might keep some people from buying a Vita is that, kind of like the
2532860	2537380	PSP, it's almost too nice.
2537380	2539180	Let's say you can afford the price point.
2539180	2542180	It's such a nice piece of hardware, but it's like, I don't want to put this in my pocket
2542180	2543900	or carry this around.
2543900	2546740	This is a nice thing.
2546740	2551300	If I take it out, it might get scratched or screwed up or something.
2551300	2556620	A portable device should, I don't want to say look like a toy, but the DS with the plastic
2556620	2560340	and it's got the clamshell and you close it, it looks like something that you can play
2560340	2561700	on the bus.
2561700	2564660	Whereas with the Vita, it's like, ooh, this is a very...
2564660	2566580	It's begging to get me mugged.
2566580	2567580	Yeah.
2567580	2572620	And it's weird that it almost looks too nice of a piece of thing that you want to take
2572620	2573620	outside the house.
2573620	2574620	I don't know.
2574620	2579040	Right now, the launch games, there's not really much been announced because they didn't really
2579040	2580500	know when the date of the Vita was.
2580500	2584260	And I know there's maybe four or five games that I actually know that are coming out launch
2584260	2585260	right now.
2585260	2587300	Some, I don't even know if they've been announced yet.
2587300	2596780	But Lego Harry Potter, that's not for me, Army Corps of Hell, that looks pretty cool,
2596780	2604320	Dragon's Crowned, and well, Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3.
2604320	2608220	But at least on a point you brought up with Nintendo, we don't really know what they're
2608220	2612420	doing beyond a year, but with the PlayStation Vita, we know Final Fantasy X is coming at
2612420	2614540	some point.
2614540	2619460	And with the Vita, I gotta say, the launch lineup is looking a hell lot better even with
2619460	2624180	not much announced already than the 3DS launch.
2624180	2627340	And also with the 3DS, they're still, and this is going to come up later in the show,
2627340	2633380	there's still that weirdness with that button, that right analog add-on, which is coming
2633380	2636660	to America, which we're going to bring up later, and does that mean that we're going
2636660	2638860	to get a new device altogether?
2638860	2640020	And they're just so awkward.
2640020	2643380	It's like that awkward friend you don't really want to invite over, but you kind of have
2643380	2645100	to.
2645100	2649700	Yeah, so there's a lot in the air right now for the 3DS.
2649700	2653740	Alright, well let's move on to another big thing that happened this week, of course,
2653740	2654740	BlizzCon!
2654740	2658500	And I know not all of you are into the Blizzard stuff, but they do make three pretty big PC
2658500	2661340	games, I mean, if not the biggest PC games.
2661340	2665780	Collectively they are Warcraft, Starcraft, and Diablo, and there was news about all those
2665780	2667700	games at BlizzCon this week.
2667700	2672820	But of course, the huge huge MMO, World of Warcraft, had a new expansion announced.
2672820	2675540	It's the Mists of Pandaria.
2675540	2680540	This was the name that had earlier been rumored thanks to a trademark filing earlier in the
2680540	2684980	year, but it was confirmed that the Pandarens, yes, that's panda people, will be the new
2684980	2688700	playable race in WoW for both the Alliance and the Horde.
2688700	2691700	You're going to be choosing at level 10 which side you're going to go on.
2691700	2692700	So that's the first race.
2692700	2696660	So they're going to finally add, like, you know, slash Panda Express now?
2696660	2701280	No, but apparently there's some type of achievement that you get called Panda Express when you
2701280	2705300	do, like, 100 of those rolls, because the rolls make you run faster, and I'm just thinking
2705300	2706300	like...
2706300	2707300	They get a rolly polly tumble.
2707300	2710240	Well, it makes sense, because I know whenever I eat Panda Express I've got to run really
2710240	2712540	fast to the bathroom, so it makes sense.
2712540	2714260	Womp womp.
2714260	2720900	Also coming in the expansion, the Monk class, the level cap is raised to level 90, some
2720900	2725300	brand new end game things to participate in, a dungeon challenge mode where your item levels
2725300	2729500	will be capped, and you're going to go after gold, silver, and bronze medals in the various
2729500	2730500	dungeons in the game.
2730500	2731500	That actually sounds really cool.
2731500	2733580	I'm going to be very interested in that.
2733580	2735020	PvE scenarios.
2735020	2739980	For people that like the big PvP battlegrounds without their PvP, is basically what it sounds
2739980	2744940	like, and a new pet battle system that is basically Pokemon.
2744940	2750380	Blizzard has realized that a lot of people really like the pet collecting aspect of the
2750380	2753900	game, so they're expanding this whole new mini-game into it now where you're going to
2753900	2756340	have a Pokemon battle system.
2756340	2761060	Basically you're going to have different talents on your pets, and your pets can use three
2761060	2766020	of them at a time, and they battle each other, and you can even go around the world and fight
2766020	2769100	master trainers to get new abilities.
2769100	2772820	They are not even being shy about what they're riving off here.
2772820	2775140	If Nintendo ain't going to do it, then...
2775140	2776140	Right.
2776140	2780780	And my main has, she's got like 110 little critters on her, so I'm ready to go.
2780780	2781780	I'm excited.
2781780	2782780	I want to check it out.
2782780	2786140	I'm excited to see how some of the critters are going to battle, because for the new
2786140	2789380	Halloween event this year, there's a pet that you can get very easy.
2789380	2791040	It's just a fucking box.
2791040	2795140	It's a cardboard box that follows you, but then once in a while, a little tongue will
2795140	2796620	jump out of the box.
2796620	2799140	Supposedly it eats one of the other pets.
2799140	2803420	For Stephen King fans, if you've seen the movie Creepshow, and I know you don't like
2803420	2805520	horror, it's the monster in the crate.
2805520	2809100	It's the creepy crate from Creepshow, that 80s movie is what it is.
2809100	2810100	Oh, okay.
2810100	2812100	I got you.
2812100	2817820	Also, apparently there's going to be pets that you can only find out in the world, like
2817820	2821200	at certain times of day, or during the spring.
2821200	2825020	I mean, wasn't that the kicker in the last Pokemon game on the DS?
2825020	2827420	Like there was Pokemon you can only catch at certain times of day and stuff?
2827420	2828740	So, I mean...
2828740	2831820	If only there were a way to change the time on my DS.
2831820	2833700	Oh, oh wait.
2833700	2838180	Except, now you can't change the time on the Blizzard server, so it's going to be interesting
2838180	2839180	to see.
2839180	2843220	I've already seen some people trolling that this is just going to be like the dance studio.
2843220	2846340	They're showing us screen caps now, but it's never going to happen.
2846340	2851500	I think it will, because what I'm liking about this expansion, I could care less about the
2851500	2852500	panda or the...
2852500	2856940	Well, the monk sounds interesting, I'll try a monk, but panda people, whatever, I'm over
2856940	2857940	it.
2857940	2862860	But as somebody who doesn't always get a chance to raid because I'm in more of a social guild
2862860	2867820	where I really just want to be with my friends, but I could see a group of about five people
2867820	2871180	in that guild getting really into this stupid pet battle thing.
2871180	2876700	So I like that it's giving people something else to do besides dungeons and raids.
2876700	2878740	And for that, I give them credit.
2878740	2884980	Yeah, they've really buffed up stuff for casual players and also PVP is getting entirely new
2884980	2885980	game concepts.
2885980	2886980	Murderball.
2886980	2888700	Murderball and a bunch of other stuff.
2888700	2893760	Maybe they should add it to Final Fantasy XIV since there's a lot of waiting for party.
2893760	2894760	You're funny.
2894760	2895760	All right.
2895760	2901060	So anyhow, that's pretty much all the big news with World of Warcraft, except one other
2901060	2902060	thing, right?
2902060	2903060	SalaciousPop?
2903060	2905260	Is that me or is it Loki?
2905260	2906260	No, that's you.
2906260	2907260	All right.
2907260	2908260	All right.
2908260	2909260	Okay.
2909260	2912840	So World of Warcraft at one time had 12 million subscribers, right?
2912840	2914460	Top MMO in the world.
2914460	2919980	Well, Blizzard has another game coming out called Diablo III and they have this promotion
2919980	2924520	where it's like, all right, how can we do some damage control on the fact that we're
2924520	2928900	hemorrhaging subscriptions and also maybe cross pollinate our WoW audience with Diablo
2928900	2929900	III?
2929900	2934980	And what they've come up with is if you have a WoW license on your battle.net account as
2934980	2939860	of October 18th, so it's already too late to buy a new WoW license for this.
2939860	2942020	So this is somewhat of a loyalty program.
2942020	2945380	Yeah, it's pretty much damage controlled.
2945380	2952060	You agree to a year of WoW billed at the regular $14.99 every 30 days.
2952060	2954920	You're just saying that you're going to do that for 12 months out.
2954920	2959140	You're going to get a free digital download license of Diablo III.
2959140	2964200	You're going to get access to the Mists of Pandaria beta, probably the very last stage
2964200	2966460	of it after the...
2966460	2968020	Everyone who signs up gets to play anyway.
2968020	2972860	Like after they do friends and family and after the NDA has been lifted.
2972860	2977540	And you get a Diablo themed, pretty badass looking mount for your WoW account in World
2977540	2979660	of Warcraft.
2979660	2983600	So yeah, there are some conditions obviously you need to have WoW on your battle.net account
2983600	2985820	as of last Wednesday.
2985820	2988180	If you...
2988180	2993900	In the terms and conditions of the agreement, if you, for whatever reason, your credit card
2993900	2999740	stops working and you don't make your payments, I believe they can pull the Diablo III license
2999740	3003820	from your battle.net account simply because you have to log in to battle.net because of
3003820	3006020	the real ID and stuff when you play Diablo III.
3006020	3009000	And Diablo III is very controversial because it's going to be online only.
3009000	3013940	And now we see another reason why.
3013940	3018080	Which to fuel all that anger that people had before about they can't play Diablo III offline,
3018080	3019700	now here's another reason why.
3019700	3022060	Because these people that are going to get the game for free, they're going to need to
3022060	3024620	connect every time to make sure their credit cards didn't bounce.
3024620	3028020	And just to reiterate, if you sign up for this loyalty agreement, your cancel button
3028020	3029060	is greyed out.
3029060	3031460	You can't cancel.
3031460	3035560	It's a cell phone contract in video games.
3035560	3040220	And the timing can't be better because if you do this, because obviously hell yeah people
3040220	3044900	want Diablo III, it's going to be one of the biggest games of either next year probably.
3044900	3051300	You know, we've got Star Wars, MMO of the Old Republic coming out, Guild Wars 2, and
3051300	3054500	whatever else, they're saying you can go play those games if you want but you're paying
3054500	3060380	for wow for a year regardless so you can have fun, we got your money.
3060380	3065000	It's actually, when all is said and done, as kind of evil as it sounds, it's genius.
3065000	3069060	It's absolute genius on Blizzard's part, is to lock people in.
3069060	3073220	Lock in your loyal customers that are going to say, shit, I'm going to play wow for the
3073220	3075940	next year anyway and you're going to give me Diablo III free?
3075940	3077220	Fuck yeah, I'm in.
3077220	3082100	But now you can't make flirty eyes with Star Wars, MMO, and you can't go off and cheat
3082100	3083100	with Guild Wars 2.
3083100	3084980	You can, you're paying for both.
3084980	3087020	But yeah, Blizzard will still have your money.
3087020	3090240	You're not going to be tempted to cut wow for the other.
3090240	3093580	And that's I think part of the reason why they're also saying well it's like a loyalty
3093580	3094580	thing.
3094580	3095700	You can't already be a customer.
3095700	3099100	This is to lock those 11 million people in, best they can.
3099100	3103580	Yeah, so if you already have a relationship with wow and you're on the fence as to how
3103580	3107820	long you're going to be with wow, this is to basically say, you know, pony up, we're
3107820	3110440	going to keep you and this is how we're going to do it.
3110440	3114700	This isn't for people that have been thinking about trying out wow.
3114700	3118140	Like this isn't a way to hop on both trains.
3118140	3120980	You know what's interesting about this too is that, and I don't even know if this got
3120980	3124540	brought up on the other show when we were talking about it, but you know, um, yeah,
3124540	3128020	you're going to get Diablo 3 free, but what else is going to come out while you're locked
3128020	3134140	into this 12 year or 12 month, not 12 year, 12 month, uh, plan Mr. Pandaria.
3134140	3138180	So if you really want the full wow experience that you've now committed to, you're going
3138180	3140780	to have to get Mr. Pandaria.
3140780	3143900	So you may not have to buy Diablo 3, but you're going to have to buy the other game.
3143900	3149420	I mean, I guess you don't have to, but you know that they're thinking everybody's going
3149420	3152260	to that's locked in if they're locked into their wow account.
3152260	3156900	For the previous wow expansion, Wrath of the Lich King, a lot of people killed the Lich
3156900	3160740	King, which was the end boss supreme raid boss of that expansion.
3160740	3165400	And then they canceled their wow all through the summer and they didn't sign up for until
3165400	3166660	Cataclysm came out in December.
3166660	3168860	So they got to save money by just saying, I'm going to be back.
3168860	3170240	I'm just taking five months off.
3170240	3172080	You can't really do that with this, right?
3172080	3175060	You can't, you know, we killed Deathwing and Cataclysm.
3175060	3179500	You can't quit and come back from Mr. Pandaria if you're paying for this promotion.
3179500	3182780	I want to clarify because some folks in chat are talking about how the payment works.
3182780	3183880	Here's the deal.
3183880	3187860	You're not agreeing to any type of payment plan with this.
3187860	3190800	You're agreeing to keep your account current for 12 months.
3190800	3194340	You can still pay with the cards, the prepaid cards.
3194340	3196940	So if you never want to give Blizzard your credit card, apparently you still don't have
3196940	3197940	to.
3197940	3199700	You can use the prepaid cards.
3199700	3203140	But the other thing is, is that, well, I'm assuming though you have to still have a credit
3203140	3207980	card on file, but so I don't know if you could really, but my understanding is that it can
3207980	3210620	use the prepaid cards and when you sign up for it.
3210620	3215100	And I, I did it last night because let's do the lump sum.
3215100	3217620	We can't, you can't do a 12 month lump sum.
3217620	3221100	I know people are thinking that or that you have to pay that upfront, but you can't do
3221100	3222100	12.
3222100	3224660	It's the same payment methods that were always there.
3224660	3227520	You can do one month at 1499 a month.
3227520	3232780	You can do three month lump sum at 1399 a month, or you can do what I did the six month
3232780	3235300	lump sum at 1299 a month.
3235300	3239900	And I know, so this month I'll have to pay $77, which is going to be six months a while,
3239900	3242860	which I know I'm going to be playing anyway because I have the other show.
3242860	3248200	And then in April, around the time I get my tax refund, I'll have to pay the other $77
3248200	3249400	and then I'll be good for the year.
3249400	3251140	So I kind of figure it'll work.
3251140	3255060	Yeah, that, that's good because I was on the three month plan cause 40 bucks, you know,
3255060	3259180	once a quarter is reasonable and it's a dollar off what you'd be paying monthly.
3259180	3263620	I thought that you had to roll over to 1499 every 30 days with this promotion, so it's
3263620	3268200	great to hear that you can, you do not, you can pick what you can still do the three months,
3268200	3272800	but I think you have to have some type of recurring thing on file, but if you end up
3272800	3275600	using the prepaid cards, then you're fine.
3275600	3278700	It'll just keep, you know, you'll never get charged cause you keep stocking up with prepaid
3278700	3283500	cards, but obviously they're going to, if they're going to give you a $50 game for free,
3283500	3286400	they want to make sure that you're going to make good on your promise.
3286400	3289980	You know, because I don't see blizzard sending bill collectors after people if they don't
3289980	3290980	make good on their payments.
3290980	3294720	Well, what if you get Diablo three through this promotion and then you make IRL money
3294720	3296520	with the new Diablo three auction house thing?
3296520	3299880	We'll shut that shit down if you don't, if you don't make good on your payments and something
3299880	3300880	you think about.
3300880	3304040	And what I really want to come to this, like I know some of you could give a shit about
3304040	3309680	wow and Diablo and all that stuff like, like Loki probably doesn't really, but here's what
3309680	3313700	I do want to say with this and Loki where I can get your opinion is that now that blizzard
3313700	3319320	has thrown that idea out there precedent has been set precedent has been set.
3319320	3320320	Imagine it.
3320320	3331700	Loki next year, sign up for a year of Xbox live and get free halo maps, woo PlayStation
3331700	3334160	plus to an extent is somewhat like this.
3334160	3337920	I give you free games, but the minute you stopped paying for PlayStation plus they're
3337920	3338920	gone.
3338920	3341200	Yeah, I could see that.
3341200	3345620	I mean I already paid for live so I don't really care.
3345620	3349560	I mean that's just my thing cause I do play online every day.
3349560	3351520	Well almost every day.
3351520	3355880	So it's not like you can go without it.
3355880	3359580	And they already and it's already, I already renew a year or year prepaid every time.
3359580	3364840	So yeah, that's cool if you want to give me some more free shit on top of that, cool.
3364840	3369640	I probably don't give a crap about it, especially if it's halo maps or even halo a game.
3369640	3373080	You know, I don't care.
3373080	3376460	I got to say though, I mean I know there's a lot of chatter on the internet and a lot
3376460	3381200	of people and of course a lot of cynical ness about this and I understand it is, you know,
3381200	3386460	I have to admit I did have a big hesitation about doing this because it's signing a contract
3386460	3387540	with a video game company.
3387540	3388800	That's a little weird to me.
3388800	3389960	It's really weird.
3389960	3394500	But at the end of the day I realized, look, I'm going to pay for this game for a year.
3394500	3395500	I know I'm going to be doing this.
3395500	3398580	I have the other show and it's not going anywhere anytime soon.
3398580	3400320	And I know I'm buying Diablo three.
3400320	3402060	Like I know I'm buying, I'm in the beta right now.
3402060	3403060	I love it.
3403060	3404280	I, it's, I need more of it.
3404280	3405720	I'm going to buy Diablo three.
3405720	3407280	So for me, this is great.
3407280	3408480	It's not for everybody.
3408480	3410320	This deal is not for everybody.
3410320	3415060	In fact, if most people that are probably making fun of this probably aren't even eligible
3415060	3418500	for it anyway because you have to be a current wow subscriber.
3418500	3419720	So this isn't for everybody.
3419720	3422640	This is just Blizzard's way of making sure you're going to stay loyal.
3422640	3425400	And if you dealt, they'll give you a little something extra.
3425400	3428760	I mean, at the end of the day, I said, you know what, I'm going to end up paying for
3428760	3429760	a while anyway.
3429760	3432840	And I know it, I might as well get Diablo three free.
3432840	3435840	By the way, and there's another, isn't there, isn't there something a little less on this
3435840	3436840	too?
3436840	3437840	Yeah.
3437840	3441520	I was going to mention, um, Blizzard always puts out very sexy collector's editions, whether
3441520	3444240	it be for a wow expansion or for Starcraft or whatever.
3444240	3448640	Um, so of course Diablo three collector's edition is going to have some nice swag in
3448640	3449640	it.
3449640	3454840	Some bonus stuff, namely a, um, the big one is going to be a USB drive with a little Diablo
3454840	3457280	skull caddy that you can put the drive in.
3457280	3462120	And on that drive is Diablo two, and I believe it's expansion, at least I would hope so that
3462120	3465160	you can then install off the USB drive or play off the USB drive.
3465160	3470700	Um, you're going to get the wow mount that you would also get for doing this, um, annual
3470700	3473840	subscription with the free copy if you're an existing well, so you get the mount.
3473840	3478400	Um, but also if you're thinking, well, I want to do this 12 month promotion and get the
3478400	3480720	game for free, but that's the standard edition.
3480720	3485440	If I go to fries or Best Buy and I'm going to drop 80 bucks for this hella Diablo three
3485440	3489160	box edition, cause it's bad-ass, that's going to screw me over for the promotion.
3489160	3494280	Um, what's going to happen is, is if you apply that collector's edition code to your battle.net
3494280	3498920	account with the 12 month promotion thing on it, you're, they're going to add four months
3498920	3500960	free to your wow subscription.
3500960	3505840	So you are going to make up that money somehow and in lieu of more wow, more wow, pay 12
3505840	3507320	months a while, get more wow.
3507320	3508800	So there you go.
3508800	3509800	All right.
3509800	3512520	So anyhow, I don't want to dwell too much on this, but you know, again, I think the
3512520	3520600	precedent here, don't be surprised if Activision, the parent company, isn't looking at this
3520600	3525920	going, Hmm, how could we sell more Skylanders dolls by getting people to commit?
3525920	3529080	How much do you love your Skylanders?
3529080	3530080	We'll see.
3530080	3534440	I just, I don't know if it would really work with anything other than a, you know, subscription
3534440	3539640	service like, you know, cause they kind of already do that with Call of Duty elite.
3539640	3542460	You would, so either it's a one year fee.
3542460	3547040	It's not like, Hey, at the sign of contract, it's, yeah, we just have one fee.
3547040	3551760	So I don't know, it would just, it would have to put out more MMOs over to imagine.
3551760	3552760	All right.
3552760	3554840	Well, let's move on with some more gaming news.
3554840	3555840	Loki.
3555840	3564920	So, uh, so some non wow related stuff, um, we can talk a little bit about a game.
3564920	3568720	I used to play a lot in the arcade since we were talking about arcades a little bit ago,
3568720	3569960	NFL blitz.
3569960	3570960	It's coming back.
3570960	3571960	Yeah.
3571960	3576160	Hey, remember Midway used to put it out and then Midway went under and then, you know,
3576160	3584600	they tried re, you know, booting it or whatever and then quite work out too well.
3584600	3587440	So now of course it's called NFL blitz.
3587440	3588440	So who has it?
3588440	3596380	Of course, EA, because they have the NFL license and a EA, we'll be putting that out in 2012.
3596380	3602240	It's going to be, uh, put out by EA Tiberian and uh, it's kind of neat.
3602240	3607360	They've got a pretty much the same gameplay style as before, plus a little bit of like
3607360	3610440	a Madden flare thrown in there.
3610440	3616720	And um, I guess they also say that you have a currency system called blitz bucks where
3616720	3624280	you can boost, uh, your teams and modify them in a bunch of different ways as well as, um,
3624280	3628840	custom modes and loading screens, stat boosting type stuff.
3628840	3632480	And um, also custom rosters.
3632480	3637560	You can set up a survival mode, uh, called a blitz gauntlet.
3637560	3642440	And I guess that's where you take on several teams, um, back to back.
3642440	3645920	And then also they have a online gameplay as well.
3645920	3647160	So that should be pretty big.
3647160	3648160	Yeah.
3648160	3653760	I have to admit, you know, again, I'm not super into sports games, but if I was into
3653760	3657600	a game that was like football, it would be NFL blitz.
3657600	3660120	And I like the arcade sports games.
3660120	3661120	It's not too big of a surprise.
3661120	3662120	I mean, come on.
3662120	3663120	They have NBA jams.
3663120	3671460	So yeah, and apparently from another article that I read, um, it actually got leaked out
3671460	3676080	by somebody a while back, but it was just kind of one of those, an industry insider
3676080	3681440	says this and you know, they didn't really have much, you know, to back it up, but it
3681440	3683920	did leak out a while back.
3683920	3684920	Yeah.
3684920	3687840	I was going to say they did a really good job keeping it a secret.
3687840	3694360	I mean, there was one story I think somewhere, but you know, with a series like NFL blitz,
3694360	3697940	there's always going to be a rumor, especially, you know, we all know midway shut down.
3697940	3700760	We all know their assets were sold off, including the IPs.
3700760	3703520	It was just a matter of time before it showed up.
3703520	3704520	Right.
3704520	3705520	Yeah.
3705520	3710040	So, so hit stun in chat asks, so the Madden developers are making NFL blitz now.
3710040	3715480	Kinda, I mean, it's not the same team, but it's same building pretty much.
3715480	3716480	Right.
3716480	3717480	Yeah.
3717480	3718480	Just down the hall from each other.
3718480	3719480	Right.
3719480	3720480	Yeah.
3720480	3723160	Well, it's not a big surprise cause they've, they've done like some different things before.
3723160	3731200	Like they've tried that, uh, like there was a, uh, NFL game that they put out a while
3731200	3732200	back.
3732200	3736200	Well, they had NFL street and that's kind of been in sore hit and miss.
3736200	3742320	And then they had, uh, some NFL game, I think it was like, uh, all pro or something like
3742320	3743320	that.
3743320	3747880	You know, that was the, uh, uh, two K one, but they had another NFL game that was more
3747880	3751440	arcadey, a little bit like arena football almost.
3751440	3754200	And well, they had an arena football game at one time even.
3754200	3760800	Um, but yeah, they, they, they like to experiment with that type of stuff.
3760800	3764200	And really, you know, what they should get on the bandwagon for is rugby games because
3764200	3769680	this year is the year of rugby games and they did have a rugby game back in 06, but it's
3769680	3770680	been a while.
3770680	3771680	All right.
3771680	3775000	Let's move on with some more information about final fantasy 14.
3775000	3777440	You know, we've been talking about it a little bit on the show.
3777440	3780640	There's going to be a lot of change coming to that game next year and it's almost, it's,
3780640	3781880	it's a little bit unprecedented.
3781880	3786160	You know, we've never really had a MMO where at least that I can think of, maybe there's
3786160	3790160	no one, but we never really had one where it landed with such a thud that the developers
3790160	3794520	are like, we're going to reboot the whole damn game and make it a success.
3794520	3799840	Well, uh, now Kiyoshita, who is the producer and director of Final Fantasy 14 has come
3799840	3805400	out and said they are considering Vita and smartphone support for Final Fantasy 14.
3805400	3813320	Uh, the quote from the, uh, interview, I believe, which was with VG 24 seven, uh, said, quote,
3813320	3815440	not just the Vita, but also smartphones.
3815440	3817420	So that kind of access will be allowed.
3817420	3821640	That will open the door to things like applications that people can use to check their inventory
3821640	3824840	or check the market and purchase things from the auctions.
3824840	3828520	So it kind of sounds like what wow kind of already does, but maybe a little something
3828520	3829520	extra.
3829520	3833200	I mean, who knows what could come with this, by the way, they are also still speaking with
3833200	3838120	Microsoft about an Xbox 360 version, but they are focusing on a PlayStation three version
3838120	3841840	right now saying that basically they promised they were going to make a PlayStation three
3841840	3842980	version version.
3842980	3845420	They haven't kept it and they need to fulfill it.
3845420	3849240	But I think at this point it's probably a good thing that they wait until 2.0 is done
3849240	3851220	until they launch it on the PlayStation three.
3851220	3856240	And seriously, my God, Microsoft needs to get on the ball with, you know, allowing MMOs
3856240	3859660	onto their, uh, their service.
3859660	3865040	So, um, it'll be interesting to see if that ends up actually happening or maybe who knows
3865040	3869400	for the next Xbox system, you know, Final Fantasy 11 was one of the early, early titles for
3869400	3870400	the Xbox 360.
3870400	3871400	So you never know.
3871400	3873080	It might end up going onto the next.
3873080	3875760	And that didn't need, uh, XP gold.
3875760	3876760	Did it?
3876760	3877760	No.
3877760	3882040	11 is really unlike any other 360 game because if you think about it, play online as a joint
3882040	3886000	venture with Sony, you've got a Sony game on a, and that was their biller rider, their
3886000	3887000	membership thing.
3887000	3888000	Yeah.
3888000	3889000	Now 14 doesn't use that.
3889000	3894360	It's a, it's all kind of separate, but Final Fantasy 11 is really unlike anything else
3894360	3895400	on the 360.
3895400	3900120	And I think Microsoft really bent all the rules to get that game on their console because
3900120	3902720	you know, it was, it was early on, it was a launch.
3902720	3904760	And I got to say, cause I did play 11 back in the day.
3904760	3905760	It was pretty awesome on the 360.
3905760	3909840	Like if you had the keyboard and everything for it, it was a great way to play the game.
3909840	3914600	So, and I was talking to you about this last night, but, uh, luckily for Final Fantasy
3914600	3920580	14, it's a gorgeous enough game that if it takes them another year or two to get their
3920580	3925240	shit together, considering how wow is seven years old and is finally starting to show
3925240	3932240	its age visually, it's a pretty enough a game that it will still be relevant by the time
3932240	3933600	they fix it.
3933600	3934600	Yeah.
3934600	3939000	So, I mean, the other thing I, with the whole PlayStation three launch of 2.0, I wanted
3939000	3943120	to kind of reiterate is that remember when Final Fantasy 11 came out in America, we got
3943120	3947160	version 2.0 of the game was the launch of the game to us because the rise of the Zillart
3947160	3949960	expansion was included when that game launched here.
3949960	3953720	So we never saw the earliest version of that game, which also I guess was kind of buggy.
3953720	3957880	So I don't know, it's going to be interesting to see what happens, but don't expect me to
3957880	3960080	pay for the game for a year to find out.
3960080	3962600	That's, that's my big thing.
3962600	3963600	So we'll see.
3963600	3970560	Um, speaking of MMOs, uh, we get another question in our chat room from, uh, did I get away
3970560	3971560	ZHEB?
3971560	3972560	Z-H-E?
3972560	3973560	Z-H-E?
3973560	3974560	I can't pronounce this.
3974560	3975560	ZHSB, I think it is.
3975560	3979560	You're going to make them spell it out again.
3979560	3984960	Yeah, ZHSB in chat says, do you think Guild Wars two will end up being higher quality
3984960	3985960	than wow?
3985960	3989720	I know it won't be a wow killer, but I'm still curious to see what you think.
3989720	3995720	Guild Wars strength will always be its model and the fact that once you buy the game, there
3995720	3997040	is no monthly fee.
3997040	4001220	And that is so alluring to a lot of people that don't want to play wow, you know, because
4001220	4002220	of that whole thing.
4002220	4006120	And that's what makes Final Fantasy 14 good right now is that it's the same model essentially
4006120	4007720	because they're not charging for monthly fee.
4007720	4011920	Uh, Guild Wars two looks great, but I can't tell you anything else until I can really
4011920	4013040	get my hands on it.
4013040	4016840	It's one thing to see the demos on YouTube and I gotta say it looks sexy as hell.
4016840	4017840	The graphics look great.
4017840	4023440	I'm really excited, but again, I got to get my hands on it until I can really tell you
4023440	4024840	if it's going to be worth it or not.
4024840	4026240	So next year we'll see.
4026240	4029880	So, all right, let's move on.
4029880	4033920	More stories, Slicey Pop.
4033920	4039080	So of course we all remember back in April when it was the week that Portal two and Mortal
4039080	4043280	Kombat came out that PlayStation network was hacked and everyone was very sad and it was
4043280	4046740	very end of the world.
4046740	4054960	And as a result, when all these gaming journalism sites were like, well, how can you avoid having
4054960	4059260	your credit cards saved to these servers if they're going to get compromised so often?
4059260	4063560	And one of the solutions was to buy game codes.
4063560	4068640	I know if you go into GameStop, you'll see a whole wall of basically these kind of look
4068640	4074080	like gift cards at the supermarket where you're just buying the code.
4074080	4076120	You're paying obviously the retailer for that.
4076120	4080600	You take the code, you load it into your PS3 and you're downloading the game directly without
4080600	4085360	having to put a credit card, put points into your PSN bucket and all that stuff.
4085360	4089640	One of the ways to get these codes was through Amazon.
4089640	4092600	You could buy these cards through Amazon directly.
4092600	4097040	Or I think maybe they just emailed a code to you and it was a way to get around Sony's
4097040	4102120	shopping cart and if you're worried about having your credit card information stolen
4102120	4109400	because Amazon I think is a more reputable retailer, well, those PSN stores, primarily
4109400	4112600	the ones on Amazon, all that content has been removed.
4112600	4114400	You cannot do that anymore.
4114400	4118440	So for all the people that were using Amazon to get around PSN.
4118440	4121160	Which was a lot more people after the hacks, I'm sure.
4121160	4122160	Yeah.
4122160	4123160	After that whole end of the world thing.
4123160	4127520	And we still haven't heard, I don't think, about anybody really getting screwed over.
4127520	4128520	Meanwhile on Xbox.
4128520	4129520	Yeah.
4129520	4130520	Meanwhile on Xbox Live.
4130520	4135520	Who by the way got hacked this week, another friend of mine, just saying.
4135520	4140760	So Amazon has confirmed the removal of the content and they have no announcements regarding
4140760	4144680	this change in selection so they're being kind of hush-hush about it.
4144680	4149080	I believe Sony has been nudged to their PR saying, what's up with Amazon?
4149080	4152160	Why'd they drop your stuff?
4152160	4153880	Sony hasn't responded yet.
4153880	4154880	Interesting.
4154880	4155880	So.
4155880	4160040	They could be, they might be just not happy with the fact that, what was it, they found
4160040	4165600	out that it was like some Amazon servers that were used to hack the Playstation network or
4165600	4166600	whatever like that.
4166600	4172160	Oh yeah, it was through like one of their S3 data, like web hosting accounts or something.
4172160	4173160	Yeah.
4173160	4177600	I doubt that has anything to do with it but more of that they want more control over that
4177600	4178600	stuff.
4178600	4184280	Yeah, I'm kind of curious as to what's going on there but maybe it's just they just for
4184280	4185960	whatever reason don't want to do it.
4185960	4189080	Maybe they just want to try to get more people to tie their credit cards on PSN.
4189080	4190080	Yeah.
4190080	4191080	Or maybe.
4191080	4192080	Yeah.
4192080	4194400	It could have, we don't really know if it was Amazon's decision.
4194400	4196280	Maybe because they just, maybe they just didn't sell well.
4196280	4201020	Maybe people just buy those game codes at a retailer like a brick and mortar one.
4201020	4203440	Or maybe Sony's got something competing coming up.
4203440	4204440	Who knows?
4204440	4205440	So.
4205440	4208320	Alright, anyhow, let's travel the world and check out release dates.
4208320	4211060	What is coming out to a gaming store near you this week?
4211060	4213320	And it's starting to ramp up towards the holidays, right Loki?
4213320	4214680	Ah yeah, it's already ramped up.
4214680	4215680	We've got tons of stuff.
4215680	4223240	This week, Pokemon Rumble Blast for the 3DS coming out, you can battle your Pokemon.

4245120	4249000	Fast Dance Kids 2 on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii.
4249000	4251200	Ew, is that like Kidz Bop?
4251200	4255160	You know, it used to be kind of like the wheels on the bus go round and round and that kind
4255160	4260040	of bullshit, but actually it's not so much that now.
4260040	4266280	They do have some songs on there, I'm not really sure if I recognize them.
4266280	4267920	Is it just family safe stuff?
4267920	4274380	Like old disco songs and not like, you know, ooh, pop your pussy girl, ooh, like that kind
4274380	4275380	of music.
4275380	4276380	Yeah, nothing like that.
4276380	4280600	No, like they had some songs listed on here, like I don't even know what, yeah, shake your
4280600	4286120	groove thing, obviously, uh, Whip My Hair, no idea what that is, Despicable Me.
4286120	4287720	Wait, wait, you don't know Whip My Hair?
4287720	4289760	No, what's Whip My Hair?
4289760	4291400	Willow Smith?
4291400	4292400	Will Smith's kid?
4292400	4295280	Oh, no, I don't know his song, sorry, okay.
4295280	4297800	No, no, it's not his song, it's his kid song.
4297800	4300200	I whip my hair back and forth, you've never heard that song.
4300200	4302920	No, I have not heard that song, and I don't wish to hear that song.
4302920	4304640	Do you live in a cave or something?
4304640	4309280	I don't listen to fucking radio, okay, oh, I'm sorry, it's not one of the ten songs that
4309280	4313480	they play on top 40 stations, yes, I know, top 40, that means they play the same ten
4313480	4317560	songs four times every hour.
4317560	4322280	You have to hear how amazing this song is, and by amazing, I mean amazingly terrible,
4322280	4325920	hold on, I'm trying to bring it up in studio right now, hold on, let's see here if I can
4325920	4326920	get it going.
4326920	4341000	Yeah, props to him, I mean, I hope that he does end up-
4341000	4344000	Just remember, she's nine.
4344000	4347640	Come on, Loki, dance.
4347640	4352040	Okay, I'll stop torturing the listeners.
4352040	4354880	What the hell?
4354880	4359720	She obviously did not inherit her dad's musical talent, but hey-
4359720	4361920	She's nine, Loki, give her a break.
4361920	4364840	Yeah, she's nine, I've seen better, okay, I mean-
4364840	4368760	You've seen better nine year olds, really, where on Toddlers and Tiaras?
4368760	4373320	Because I can't think of where else to see nine year olds performing.
4373320	4378400	Well on America's Got Talent, on The X Factor, on, you know-
4378400	4380440	Are you rooting for What's Her Name, that little girl?
4380440	4384720	No, you see, here's the thing, I watched The X Factor one time.
4384720	4389880	The first night it was on, and I haven't looked back.
4389880	4395920	I think it's catchy, she has great producers, but whatever.
4395920	4400040	Something That I Want and Love Me, I don't know any of those songs, anyways, so yeah,
4400040	4405360	they have 40 plus fun songs in there, that's all you need, that's kids stuff.
4405360	4410880	Centipede Infestation on the Wii and 3DS, this is Atari trying to reboot the Centipede
4410880	4413440	franchise, good luck with that.
4413440	4420440	Photo World on the Nintendo DS, this is a game that is going to be, I guess, using the
4420440	4422920	DSi.
4422920	4427680	It's basically a game for taking photos and editing photos or something like that.
4427680	4429160	That sounds terrible.
4429160	4434280	Nikolai's Pencil Puzzle 3D for the 3DS, the first puzzle game, I think, for the 3DS.
4434280	4437520	Well, you know, like brain training type thing.
4437520	4446920	Son of Fantasy for PC, Squinkies 2 Adventure Mall Surprise from Activision, thank you.
4446920	4448400	Thank you, thank you, thank you.

4456840	4459880	know what the hell a Squinkies is.

4492640	4497880	Telltale is releasing Back to the Future on Playstation 3 and the Wii, that's kind of
4497880	4498880	a surprise.

4522120	4525440	Oh yeah, they made a movie out of that didn't they?
4525440	4526440	Yes they did.
4526440	4527440	Okay.
4527440	4534560	Cause they're done with Shrek and they need to, you know, Antonio Banderas needs to eat.
4534560	4539720	That's on Xbox 360, Playstation 3, DS, Wii, and I think 3DS.
4539720	4546040	Disney Universe, this is supposed to be like Kingdom Hearts, sort of, kinda, not really.
4546040	4550040	I'm curious about Disney Universe, I gotta admit, cause like everybody was like, Rob
4550040	4554240	you'd be so into this game, and I haven't heard a lot about it, which is usually a bad
4554240	4555240	sign.
4555240	4559320	It reminds me of a Ratchet and Clank type game, it's uh, you know, of course you get
4559320	4562880	to wear different costumes, you can get abilities from those costumes.
4562880	4565160	It's on 360, Wii, and PS3.
4565160	4569480	House of the Dead Overkill, I'm looking, if you hear things in the background, I'm looking
4569480	4571800	at like a little walkthrough, I guess, of the game.
4571800	4576680	House of the Dead Overkill extended cut on Playstation 3 with even more swearing.
4576680	4580680	Sorry, I don't wanna hear the, I was gonna play the audio, but it's just some douchebag
4580680	4582260	talking over the gameplay.
4582260	4583260	It looks neat.
4583260	4584260	Yeah, it looks alright.
4584260	4586080	It looks like a little big planet.
4586080	4590760	I think I remember somebody saying something about like a little big planet-ish Disney
4590760	4591760	game.
4591760	4596080	Yeah, I mean, they look like the little big planet sack boys, but it's obviously not that,
4596080	4597560	but I mean, it looks alright.
4597560	4599120	That might be kinda fun, I might check that out.
4599120	4600120	Definitely a good kid's game.
4600120	4601120	Um.
4601120	4602120	What do you mean kid's game?
4602120	4603120	I love Disney.
4603120	4604120	Alright.
4604120	4605120	You hush.

4628360	4635160	Country Dance 2 on the Wii, and Jane's Advanced Strike Fighter for PC.
4635160	4636160	That is it.
4636160	4637160	That was a lot of games.
4637160	4640200	It is a lot of games, and it's only gonna get bigger until it gets to December.
4640200	4644520	Alright, Japan this week, going to Japan on the 27th of October, Dance Central 2 on the
4644520	4652200	Xbox 360, Kinect Sports Season 2, Moovloov, Muv Luv, I don't know what this is, Muv Luv,
4652200	4655760	and a Warhammer 40,000 space ring, I've gotta see what Muv Luv is.
4655760	4656760	Muv Luv?
4656760	4657760	I don't wanna see the peripheral for that.
4657760	4663600	No, it's, it's not Muv Luv, I think it's an anime, I think it's based off an anime, cause
4663600	4666680	clearly it's a bunch of anime chicks, I'm looking for, like, gameplay, and I don't see
4666680	4672320	any, so, oh, there's one, that's, Muv Luv, looks like Sakura Wars, strategy, maybe?
4672320	4673520	I don't know.
4673520	4678620	Big Tittied Cyberbots, uh, let's see, moving on, the best kind, that is an awesome name
4678620	4681360	for a game.
4681360	4685480	Don't push your luck, just because we're getting, uh, bungee ferret tossing, don't push your
4685480	4692240	luck on Big Tittied Cyberbots, although, if anything was gonna get added to the list,
4692240	4700640	the week Jamie's not here, uh, on the Playstation 3 this week, Makai Senki Disgaea 4, that's
4700640	4705420	right, Disgaea 4 out in Japan this week, as well as Midnight Club Los Angeles, uh, going

4711040	4717640	very excited about this one, you ready, the Idolmaster 2 on the Playstation 3 this week.
4717640	4721840	All I have to say about the Idolmaster is just, just, go look at some gameplay video
4721840	4725880	on YouTube, that's really all I have to say, um, looking at some of the handhelds this
4725880	4732480	week, the Sony PSP Arcana Familia, La Storia della Arcana Familia, I don't know what the
4732480	4738000	heck this game is, uh, I don't know if that's, I'm trying to look again at gameplay, but
4738000	4743920	it just, again, looks like another anime slash comic manga type of integrated thing there,
4743920	4747960	uh, Final Fantasy Type Zero, I think there'll be a few people excited about that, that is
4747960	4754360	finally out on the PSP this week, Ragnarok Hikari Toyami no Kujo, yes, I believe this
4754360	4759200	is another Ragnarok Online, yep, based game, that's what it looks like to me, so, Dark
4759200	4764200	Sakura, sadly not here to squeak, Soshipop, are you gonna squeak on behalf of Dark Sakura?
4764200	4771120	Thank you, uh, Senritsu no Stratus comes out on the PSP this week as well in Japan, and

4866320	4867320	Woo.
4867320	4868320	Alright.
4868320	4874440	And there's a whole bunch of other stuff listed under generically October 2011 and I'm not
4874440	4875880	gonna read off all that stuff.
4875880	4876880	Yeah.
4876880	4877880	There's a lot.
4877880	4878880	That's fine.
4878880	4879880	Alright, let's move on.
4879880	4883320	Just a couple more stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week, yes, Dark
4883320	4887320	Sakura has given her blessing that we could do a game this week without her, and we've
4887320	4888480	got a good one tonight.
4888480	4890560	Uh, meanwhile, couple quick news stories.
4890560	4891560	Loki.
4891560	4896680	Hey, I remember a few months back, several months back, there was a guy named Jigohot
4896680	4903520	and there was a whole bunch of hub-a-bub about, uh, hub-a-lub, hub-a-loo, about, uh, you know,
4903520	4907880	PlayStation 3 and jailbreaks and stuff like that and the keys being leaked out and all
4907880	4908880	that fun stuff.
4908880	4910680	Well, we're back to that again.
4910680	4913640	Um, there is a new jailbreak that's out now.
4913640	4921080	It apparently is for, uh, the firmware version 355 consoles and supports games up to current,
4921080	4926080	up to the current firmware, uh, 3.73, so you're able to patch the games and play them on those
4926080	4927080	consoles.
4927080	4933760	Finally, the dongle will allow you to play titles burned to Blu-ray discs, uh, via, um,
4933760	4938960	a hard drive, including FIFA 12, Driver San Francisco, God of War Origins Collection,
4938960	4945320	Pro Evo 2012, X-Men Destiny, and Sniper Ghost Warrior, and, uh, it's circulating in Indonesia
4945320	4951040	right now and will be sold for roughly 45 bucks, and, uh, they have, like, a little
4951040	4955760	video showing it and it kinda boots up to, like, a developer screen and stuff like that.
4955760	4958440	So obviously, what's that mean for everybody else?
4958440	4962760	Well, it means a lot more patches and a lot more firmware updates, of course, as they
4962760	4968240	try to block this thing, so look forward to that, and hopefully the network doesn't go
4968240	4972280	down again.
4972280	4978660	Like I've said before, I think, uh, crypto hackers that are really into DRM and stuff,
4978660	4980480	they may not even care about games that much.
4980480	4984600	They just love the challenge of breaking really good crypto, and then they put it out and
4984600	4988680	they make money off of it, so, you know, who knows?
4988680	4992520	But it's just gonna, you know, it's just like plugging your thumb into a dam with all these
4992520	4997280	holes in it, trying to keep the water out, and only do it for so long.
4997280	5003240	Alright, well, moving on to another story for you guys, this is actually a pretty big
5003240	5004240	one.
5004240	5007400	Nintendo had a press conference in the middle of the night, well, okay, it was day during
5007400	5010760	Japan, but it was the middle of the night for us, about the 3DS, and just detailing
5010760	5014280	a ton and ton of new updates coming for the 3DS.
5014280	5019180	It's all around one big firmware update coming this November, I don't think we had a specific
5019180	5020180	date on this, right?
5020180	5021880	Of course not, so they can delay it.
5021880	5025040	Right, so it can be the very last day of November and still be on time.
5025040	5028700	Uh, some of the features that are gonna be in this, 3D video recording, which they've
5028700	5034320	said before, um, you're gonna be able to make clips up to 10 minutes long, what also is
5034320	5039320	part of this, which I admit is kinda cool, stop motion animation, part of the 3D videos.
5039320	5040320	That's neat.
5040320	5044720	I mean, it's easy, but it's, it's gonna, you know people are gonna get creative with this,
5044720	5045720	it'll be fun.
5045720	5051440	I, it's, it's a neat idea, but, ugh, cameras are just really terrible.
5051440	5054320	But that's alright, they'll fix that in the next version of the 3DS, so.
5054320	5059960	Uh, there will be a map overlay to show where Miis you got in StreetPass are from, but,
5059960	5063320	I don't, does that mean, like, you'll literally be able to see, like, I got a hundred people
5063320	5064320	at Disneyland?
5064320	5065760	Well, Rob, it'll be nice to know where you live.
5065760	5069840	Well, yeah, but when you specify where you live on the 3DS, they don't have GPS in them,
5069840	5071800	you just say California.
5071800	5074680	You know, it'll be interesting, because I get a lot of StreetPasses at Disneyland when
5074680	5079080	I go, and I get a lot of people from Mexico, and I get a lot of people, of course, in California,
5079080	5082120	but I get all around the U.S., because, of course, Disneyland is a place for everybody
5082120	5083120	around the world.
5083120	5087680	I have a shit-ton of Miis from Japan, thanks to that day we were at E3, and I StreetPass
5087680	5092000	with, like, 50 people in, like, five minutes, so, eh.
5092000	5097280	You will be able to transfer software to other 3DS systems, which is good, because if, uh,
5097280	5100360	the inevitable, you know, Game Boy Advance games come out, and then you've got the inevitable
5100360	5103600	3DS upgrade that will happen next year, so, of course, you're gonna get suckered into
5103600	5106920	buying the new 3DS, you won't lose any of the shit you got on the current DS.
5106920	5109760	So where's my refund for the, uh, 3DS when that happens?
5109760	5110840	Keep on dreaming.
5110840	5116440	And, uh, the Find Me RPG that's built into the 3DS will get a sequel if you've cleared
5116440	5118060	the first iteration.
5118060	5123640	More hats, Joy, because right now the sequel is Play the Game Again.
5123640	5127240	You've got a shit-load of people on that from your trips to Disneyland, and you still
5127240	5128240	only have...
5128240	5132120	No, I've beat Find Me once, and I'm on the second go-through right now, about halfway
5132120	5133120	through go-through number two.
5133120	5134120	But do you get more hats?
5134120	5135120	You do, actually.
5135120	5137840	Well, you've encountered people with these awesome-looking, like, Metroid hats and all
5137840	5140600	this stuff, that they must have beat the game several times to get that.
5140600	5142800	No, I have the Metroid hat and I have the crown.
5142800	5146280	I don't have that demon hat that, like, is changed color.
5146280	5150360	I think that's what you get time to, because that's the last boss in Find Me, so I'm thinking
5150360	5152680	it's what you get on the second play-through when you beat it.
5152680	5153680	Okay.
5153680	5157680	So, one puzzle piece away from having every single puzzle piece in the puzzle exchange
5157680	5158680	game.
5158680	5162400	So, I'll have that soon, too.
5162400	5167560	Does finding every puzzle piece make your 3DS spawn another analog stick?
5167560	5168560	Don't think so.
5168560	5172360	You just get pretty 3D pictures to rotate around, and the one last one I need is those
5172360	5174360	stupid pigmen.
5174360	5179900	Also, I guess there's supposed to be another new StreetPass game that's not just Find Me,
5179900	5182680	so I guess they're adding more for the StreetPass stuff, which is cool.
5182680	5186320	A few more details on Mario Kart 7 came out.
5186320	5190480	You will be able to do 8 player online at 60 frames a second.
5190480	5192880	That's pretty impressive, if true, so that'll be cool.
5192880	5195420	You can do online or offline racing.
5195420	5199280	You will be able to set up communities, so you can have groups of people to race against
5199280	5201360	and have criteria for these communities.
5201360	5202360	That's kind of cool.
5202360	5205640	If there's an OLR community way to do that, we will build one, absolutely.
5205640	5210760	You're going to be able to get data from other people by using StreetPass, which will be
5210760	5214200	win-loss records, coin data, and ghost data.
5214200	5217040	That's kind of cool, because that's in Ridge Racer right now, so that'll be cool to have
5217040	5218360	that in Mario Kart.
5218360	5221620	Also announced, Lakitu and Metal Mario as characters.
5221620	5224320	They're really stretching now, aren't they?
5224320	5228040	Hulu Plus will be coming to the 3DS, and the Wii.
5228040	5233160	Mario Kart, you can put characters from your other franchises in there.
5233160	5238800	You don't just have to do Mario and Donkey Kong, because Donkey Kong's not part of the
5238800	5243840	Yeah, I know he was in the first Donkey Kong game, but the new Donkey Kong Country Crap
5243840	5247200	is not part of the Mario series.
5247200	5255320	It's its own thing, so you can put Zelda and Samus and stuff like that.
5255320	5259000	There's a lot more characters to use other than Metal Mario.
5259000	5260000	That's true.
5260000	5263240	They could be put, yeah, they could cross over, or just Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man are
5263240	5264240	in the arcade one.
5264240	5267880	I mean, I know the arcade one's made by Namco, but still, you've got that agreement.
5267880	5272960	Or, you know, some of the Smash Brothers characters, like, you know, some of the F-Zero characters.
5272960	5275720	Kid Icarus and his car can fly.
5275720	5277040	He gets extra hang glider power.
5277040	5278040	Alright, anyway.
5278040	5282660	Hulu Plus, as I was saying, is also coming to the 3DS and the Wii soon.
5282660	5286400	I'm assuming it's with that upgrade, but I guess it could be even sooner.
5286400	5290440	Hulu Plus, of course, will still cost you money to get all those TV episodes, but some
5290440	5294300	people are using it, especially as people are leaving Netflix, they're turning to Hulu
5294300	5295300	Plus.
5295300	5299960	So let's just pop, you use my 3DS more than I do, and you use it for Netflix a lot.
5299960	5304920	So if, hypothetically, if we were paying for Hulu Plus, would you be down with that?
5304920	5310080	The Netflix client on the 3DS, in my opinion, is really bad and laggy and awful, and it
5310080	5314720	times out all the time, and it's not wireless, so I would need the Hulu Plus client to be
5314720	5315720	better than that.
5315720	5316720	Interesting.
5316720	5318840	I didn't even realize it was that crappy.
5318840	5322200	What's important to note, though, is that while you might go, meh, or lol, they're still
5322200	5326640	supporting the Wii, Netflix, the Wii is the number one for Netflix, which surprised the
5326640	5329000	hell out of me, but they're in enough homes where, yeah.
5329000	5332480	We'll look at the sales date of how many Wiis were sold, it's not that much of a stretch.
5332480	5335040	So that's going to be big for them to get Hulu Plus.
5335040	5340200	I think this is kind of neat, more so than almost anything else, is that the 3DS is going
5340200	5343900	to be getting a messaging system called Nintendo Letterbox.
5343900	5347640	You will be able to send notes and photos and sounds to friends.
5347640	5352360	I mean, granted, you can kind of do this with what's called a cell phone, with SMS and so
5352360	5356080	forth, but it opens it up to younger folks if, you know, the parents are supervising
5356080	5357080	it.
5357080	5360480	Well, and they had it on the Wii, where you can send messages and photos.
5360480	5364480	But your Wii didn't really have a camera built in, so like, I could take 3D pictures of Disneyland
5364480	5367100	and send it to my friends and make them jealous, that'll be kind of cool.
5367100	5369300	So I don't know, I think it's neat.
5369300	5373400	I'm not like, oh my god, it's the most amazing technology ever to happen, but it seems like
5373400	5378240	one of those things where it's like, wow, Nintendo's finally starting to like, catch up with online
5378240	5381520	and starting to implement features that we were seeing in other systems like five years
5381520	5382520	ago.
5382520	5387480	But at least it's forward movement, good job.
5387480	5392760	So lots of stuff coming out for the 3DS in November, maybe even sooner for some of this
5392760	5393760	other stuff.
5393760	5394760	So we'll see.
5394760	5401080	All right, meanwhile, it is time to open up the gaming vault and take a trip in and find
5401080	5403480	a classic video game of the week.
5403480	5408560	Now, DarkSakura is not here tonight, but she left a key to her house, and she left the
5408560	5409900	vault unlocked.
5409900	5414040	So we made SalaciousPop go into the vault and find a game that he thinks you should
5414040	5417120	be playing this week, so that we wouldn't get in trouble.
5417120	5421360	SalaciousPop, what did you find in DarkSakura's vault that is worthy of being the classic
5421360	5422480	game of the week?
5422480	5428000	One of the first and one of the best original Legend of Zelda clones for the NES, a little
5428000	5431400	SNK RPG known as Crystallis.
5431400	5432400	Good pick.
5432400	5433400	Very good pick.
5433400	5436400	I was really surprised DarkSakura had never done this one, because it seems like one of
5436400	5440160	those things is obvious to me.
5440160	5447320	Crystallis was released in Japan April 13th of 1990 and came out in the US, translated
5447320	5453120	for the NES, three months later in July of 90.
5453120	5460440	It was praised for the original 8-bit NES, relatively advanced graphics, very beautiful
5460440	5464080	game, and also its fantastic soundtrack.
5464080	5469920	And I usually would just forget who actually made Crystallis.
5469920	5475920	I was thinking it was maybe one of Enix's first RPGs, but no, it was SNK, as of King
5475920	5476920	of Fighters fame.
5476920	5482840	This is an RPG they put out, and I'm sure they've had titles in Japan that may not have
5482840	5486480	made it over here, but I can't think of any other SNK RPGs.
5486480	5490320	Can you?
5490320	5492600	Not really, no I can't actually.
5492600	5498800	So yeah, this is kind of just a weird sort of anomaly, but it was a fantastic game.
5498800	5506280	The title in Japan was God Slayer Haruka Tenku no Sonata, which is a God Slayer Sonata of
5506280	5508520	the Faraway Sky.
5508520	5517480	Part of the plot is that basically humanity built this huge powerful tower for whatever
5517480	5523640	nefarious reason, technology got out of control, and once this tower was built up in the sky,
5523640	5529840	there was some big apocalypse, and now the world is overrun with monsters.
5529840	5537920	You wake up in a very sort of futuristic sci-fi hibernation chamber where there's a big glass
5537920	5541560	door that slides open, and you come out, and you have amnesia, and you don't know what's
5541560	5548160	going on or who you are, and you find sort of a little old RPG town, and they're like
5548160	5551560	you came out of that cave, and oh my god.
5551560	5558040	So you have to figure out who you are, and these four sages basically say that this evil
5558040	5564520	dude is trying to get into the tower, the Dragonia Empire is trying to get into the
5564520	5569600	tower so they can go blow up the world again, and you have to find these four swords, Earth,
5569600	5575440	Fire, Wind, Water, and you have to combine them to form Crystallus, and then only then
5575440	5579600	once you have that legendary sword, you can then take out the evil dude, and of course
5579600	5585720	if you're thinking that sounds kind of Zelda-ish, at least Link to the Past and so on, then
5585720	5591400	you'd probably be right that the plot lines are sort of similar.
5591400	5596800	The water sword you could use if you swung it, you could make little ice bridges over
5596800	5600760	narrow little streams of water, so there were some puzzle solving elements too on which
5600760	5602260	sword you used.
5602260	5608000	You also had XP, so you would gain levels and your stats would go up, and it was possible
5608000	5617480	if you wanted to grind and min-max your way all the way up to level 99 stats with everything.
5617480	5622560	It had some kind of janky collision detection, where you would try to avoid a monster and
5622560	5628040	you would still hit it anyway, or trying to navigate some of the lava and the paths were
5628040	5629040	kind of weird.
5629040	5633920	I know that it suffered from, you know like in Mega Man games when there were too many
5633920	5640120	sprites, it would get kind of stuttery, Crystallus had a lot of that, but otherwise it was a
5640120	5646720	very solid action RPG that had a lot of Final Fantasy elements with Legend of Zelda elements
5646720	5649420	in it too.
5649420	5656680	One thing to note is that two of the four sages that helped guide you in fulfilling
5656680	5665280	your destiny is that they were based off of Kensou and Athena, the magical girl pop star
5665280	5668200	from King of Fighters and Sai Kensou.
5668200	5674080	Two of the elders are analogs of them, so that was kind of some meta fan service even
5674080	5678280	back then in 1990 that they had done for their previous franchise, and I believe this was
5678280	5681720	before King of Fighters was a thing in 1990.
5681720	5687760	Fatal Fury I believe was out by then, and the Athena, the platformer with Sai and Athena
5687760	5688760	in it.
5688760	5692440	I was going to say, wasn't that also an NES game, like way, way, way early on?
5692440	5696680	Yeah, so those characters were already established and they did some fan service-y things with
5696680	5697680	Kensou and Athena and Crystallus.
5697680	5702280	Yeah, I remember seeing that in Crystallus and I was like, is that tied to the other
5702280	5703280	game?
5703280	5709400	Yeah, and there's a female character who you find who seems to have all of her memories
5709400	5713840	and you can tell by looking at her character model or her sprite that she's obviously from
5713840	5718480	the same time as you and she was hibernated in the past and awoke in the future just like
5718480	5724800	you were, and she kind of plays a role like Sheik in Ocarina of Time where she sort of
5724800	5729880	shows up and gives some expositive, you know, narrative and helps you and then disappears
5729880	5730880	again.
5730880	5736240	And it turns out that both you and her are scientists that willfully froze yourself so
5736240	5737640	that you could reawaken.
5737640	5741720	Spoiler, yeah, and help save the world.
5741720	5743960	This is a kick-ass game.
5743960	5744960	This is a great game.
5744960	5748800	I mean, graphical problems aside, it was just so good.
5748800	5752840	I remember it used to make my friend really sad because his birthday was October 1st and
5752840	5756720	when he blew up this game, he goes, October 1st, 1997, the end day.
5756720	5759000	That's my birthday.
5759000	5760000	That's awesome.
5760000	5761000	Oh, yeah.
5761000	5762000	I remember that.
5762000	5765840	It had that little in-game or cinematic.
5765840	5766840	Which we survived.
5766840	5770160	We got past the end day and then some.
5770160	5775960	And there are a lot of similarities with the plot and the overall styling and art direction
5775960	5782640	of the game that makes people think that it was influenced in part by Miyazaki's Nausicaa
5782640	5784760	of the Valley of the Wind.
5784760	5790520	The floating tower and a lot of the themes are similar.
5790520	5799080	And the first village that you find when you wake up from the cave is called Leaf, which
5799080	5804160	I believe there is a village in Nausicaa that was named the same thing.
5804160	5806680	Or it could just be that Leaf is kind of a common term.
5806680	5807680	Yeah.
5807680	5816080	Some of the bosses, I don't know if this is a glitch, but basically if you just spam the
5816080	5820680	shit out of your sword attack button, you could kind of kill bosses by just button mashing.
5820680	5825720	I see here that a lot of people had problems with that when there was supposed to be some
5825720	5829880	sort of more styled way on what weapons to use on a boss, but you kind of could ignore
5829880	5833960	that and just find its weak spot and beat the hell out of it.
5833960	5834960	But yeah, it's a great game.
5834960	5838200	If you have a way to play it, you should check it out.
5838200	5841840	Alright, your classic game of the week for the Nintendo Entertainment System and then
5841840	5843880	later on the Game Boy Color.
5843880	5844880	Crystallis.
5844880	5846280	Good pick.
5846280	5848280	Hopefully Jamie wasn't saving that one.
5848280	5851320	I don't know, but it's about time that one came up.
5851320	5852320	That's a great pick.
5852320	5854200	Alright, we are going to take a break, guys, but don't go anywhere.
5854200	5858240	We're going to come back with plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio, including some rapid
5858240	5865680	fire news, some early talk about Xbox and PlayStation 4, and can you believe we haven't
5865680	5867080	brought this game up yet tonight?
5867080	5868440	It's all people have been talking about all week.
5868440	5871240	Arkham City, we've got to talk about some things with that.
5871240	5875320	The mailbag, the FUs of the week, the Twitter topics, and your calls when we come back with
5875320	5883480	more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5883480	5886040	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
5886040	5887560	We are live tonight.
5887560	5893720	The 433rd episode of our show for this October the 23rd of 2011.
5893720	5897760	Dark Sakura, not here tonight, sadly, but taking her place and doing a mighty fine job
5897760	5898760	so far.
5898760	5902880	Salacious Pop, with a good classic game of the week, by the way.
5902880	5903880	Very good job.
5903880	5904880	Thank you.
5904880	5906720	One of the games that came up in the last segment that I was reading a little more about
5906720	5910080	during the break, because I was just curious about this, Disney Universe.
5910080	5913440	It really does look like it's going to be just like Little Big Planet.
5913440	5915400	It doesn't even try to hide it.
5915400	5919720	But they say, I'm looking up the Wiki on it, and they're saying, well, it also kind of
5919720	5921280	looks like the Lego games, I guess.
5921280	5926160	But you play through six different worlds to beat enemies, get power ups and coins.
5926160	5930460	And I guess you can put on costumes resembling characters from 40 classic and contemporary
5930460	5932640	Disney and Pixar properties.
5932640	5935000	Of course, the first thing I said is, is there Tron?
5935000	5936000	Is there Tron?
5936000	5937000	Is there Tron?
5937000	5938000	Is there Tron?
5938000	5939000	There's Tron.
5939000	5940000	Tron Legacy is one of them.
5940000	5941560	Sadly, I don't think that's one of the worlds you'll get to fight in.
5941560	5943500	That would make me very sad.
5943500	5944720	Maybe downloadable later.
5944720	5946440	But I love that there's like a WALL-E and stuff too.
5946440	5947440	I don't know.
5947440	5949040	I might, I might, I might have to check this out.
5949040	5950720	I'm kind of a sucker for Disney stuff.
5950720	5952920	And Little Big Planet obviously is a great game.
5952920	5953920	So we'll see.
5953920	5955720	Of course, it's probably a $60 game.
5955720	5956720	Huh?
5956720	5957720	I don't know.
5957720	5958720	Uh, no.
5958720	5959720	Oh, it's not?
5959720	5960720	I think like 50.
5960720	5961720	Oh, well, gee, such a value.
5961720	5963560	Such a, it's a bargain basement.
5963560	5964560	Oh boy.
5964560	5965560	All right.
5965560	5969240	Let's go around and do some rapid fire news because, you know, sometimes there's a lot
5969240	5972040	of news and we don't have a lot of time to go too in depth, but we want to just make
5972040	5974580	sure we cover a few things here.
5974580	5977720	Sony's 3D display will be coming out November 13th.
5977720	5985240	Of course, it's $499 and it comes with, you know, Motorstorm Apocalypse, uh, unfortunately
5985240	5989600	the Resistance 3, unlike promised before, but you know, whatever.
5989600	5994840	Um, also of course, you know, a pair of glasses and an HDMI cable that you'll need to use
5994840	5997640	that with your PlayStation 3.
5997640	6003560	And uh, you can also buy separate sets of glasses for $70 as well.
6003560	6007960	And there are games supporting it so far, uh, you know, Motorstorm Apocalypse, Gran
6007960	6014800	Turismo 5, and Killzone 3, and Super Stardust HD all support the Simulview, um, right now
6014800	6015800	at launch.
6015800	6021960	And I believe I saw that, um, Ridge Racer is supposed to be getting 3D support as well,
6021960	6022960	so that's kind of neat.
6022960	6026840	Because that's a game that would probably benefit from it quite a bit.
6026840	6031200	Um, of course, people have been begging and pleading, you know, Valve, when are you going
6031200	6037640	to release some, you know, stuff I can buy for Portal, like, you know, actual Portal
6037640	6040840	turrets and cubes and whatnot.
6040840	6044440	Well, uh, you will be able to buy a Portal turret very soon.
6044440	6050720	Uh, it's going to be plush, which, you know, fine, that's close enough, I guess.
6050720	6056260	It does have a glowing red eye with a motion detector and will, of course, spout different
6056260	6064240	phrases from the game, and, uh, they will be going on sale mid-December on ThinkGeek,
6064240	6066480	is where you can purchase those.
6066480	6071600	Of course, also, to go along with that will be the official, um, Portal companion cube.
6071600	6074480	I thought they already had a cuddly companion cube, or was that-
6074480	6077640	I think a lot of those have been, like, you know, people made them on, uh-
6077640	6078640	Was that, like, an Etsy ripoff?
6078640	6083600	Well, no, weren't there the official- they were, like, dice for your win- for your rear-view
6083600	6084600	mirror in your car.
6084600	6085600	I remember, okay, maybe it was that.
6085600	6086600	They keep dice.
6086600	6092960	This one is, uh, it's not huge, it's, like, six inches cubed, obviously, and, um, it'll
6092960	6098320	be available, uh, via the NECA shop, um, in November.
6098320	6100320	Please don't throw them in the fireplace.
6100320	6108240	I guess, um, that'll be, yeah, coming out, so, um, neat, I guess.
6108240	6113320	Like I said, I preferred that the Portal turret wasn't exactly a, uh, plush item, it kinda
6113320	6115880	looks stupid when it's plush.
6115880	6122600	You know, I'd rather a plastic thing that I can shoot bullets out of, you know.
6122600	6123600	I don't know.
6123600	6128120	Um, and then, of course, you know, to go along with Portal, there's some discussion regarding
6128120	6135120	the second DLC, um, expansion, which will be coming, uh, early next year, or late next
6135120	6140400	year, depending if it gets delayed, and, uh, it will include an in-game editor.
6140400	6144440	You may remember they were talking about, um, something before, saying, wouldn't it
6144440	6149040	be kinda cool if we could create some sort of, like, almost like a Photoshop for Portal
6149040	6154160	level editing that you can, you know, just very easily create your own levels?
6154160	6155360	Well, they're gonna do that.
6155360	6162360	Also, they're gonna allow, um, I guess, some additional, uh, view, play, vote on various
6162360	6166360	levels, that are gonna be, I think, included in this, and, um, one of the things that they're
6166360	6172320	gonna be adding is the ability to actually play, um, levels within the game without having
6172320	6175120	to actually go into the console and load up a level.
6175120	6178000	You'll be able to actually select user-made levels, because there's a lot of them out
6178000	6179000	there.
6179000	6180000	Wow.
6180000	6181000	Which would be awesome.
6181000	6182000	Yeah.
6182000	6186560	And, of course, no word if that's coming to 360, since 360 doesn't have Steam, so.
6186560	6191360	Wasn't Valve supposed to have some big announcement after Portal 2 came out on what their next
6191360	6192360	project is?
6192360	6194360	Because, as I understand it, we don't really know-
6194360	6195360	Defense of the Agents.
6195360	6196360	Of Dota 2.
6196360	6197360	Oh, that's right.
6197360	6198360	Okay.
6198360	6199360	Yeah.
6199360	6200360	Because I was thinking, what is their next big thing that they're working on?
6200360	6201360	It's certainly not Half-Life.
6201360	6202360	Don't get me started.
6202360	6203360	It's still 2.
6203360	6205360	I mean, because they've already, you've seen, there's clips of that on YouTube, like, people
6205360	6209060	are already playing it at, I guess, conventions or some type of thing.
6209060	6211360	But then, after that, who knows?
6211360	6212360	So.
6212360	6215920	Sorry, Slice2Pop, I don't think it'll be Half-Life 3, but we'll see.
6215920	6216920	You never know.
6216920	6217920	You never know.
6217920	6222840	Christmas may come early this year, Slice2Pop, have you been good?
6222840	6225920	I think if it's gonna be anything, they're just gonna update the whole source engine
6225920	6230880	just to do something brand new, like Half-Life 3 engine or something.
6230880	6233280	That's what's probably taking it so long, is they're gonna have to create a new engine
6233280	6234280	for it.
6234280	6239720	Kaijuto in our chatroom at chat.orangestop.com says, I want Portal PJs.
6239720	6243720	Would they be little companion cubes, or little, like, blue and orange portals, or what?
6243720	6246880	I saw this girl that had these portal earrings I thought were really cute, where she had
6246880	6250400	a blue portal on one ear and an orange one on the other, and, like, a guy running through.
6250400	6251920	I thought it was cute.
6251920	6255080	So there's a lot of cute little nerdy things out there.
6255080	6261040	Anyhow, moving on to some rumored, I guess, holiday-related bundles coming to the PlayStation
6261040	6262040	3.
6262040	6269240	A Mayhem Edition move bundle that will contain Killzone 3 and Resistance 3 apparently is
6269240	6270240	being rumored.
6270240	6275280	I guess this is some box factory snapshots that have leaked onto the internet.
6275280	6279240	Also a special edition of LittleBigPlanet 2 is supposedly on the way.
6279240	6280240	It's about time.
6280240	6281240	I've been waiting for one of those.
6281240	6282640	It's their Game of the Year edition, obviously.
6282640	6286240	Remember I said I wouldn't buy it until the Game of the Year edition came out.
6286240	6289160	It's November 22nd.
6289160	6290160	Is it cheaper?
6290160	6291160	Is it cheaper?
6291160	6292160	Is it cheaper?
6292160	6293160	It's the same price.
6293160	6294160	It's $59.99.
6294160	6295160	But it has all the expansions in it.
6295160	6296160	I guess it's cool.
6296160	6299880	And they're also doing a bundle that's going to have the move controller with it as well.
6299880	6301440	Oh, that's cool.
6301440	6306040	Our last few trips to Target and Best Buy have been you going LittleBigPlanet 2.
6306040	6307040	There it is.
6307040	6308040	And I don't know.
6308040	6309920	I don't think they're doing a Game of the Year, so maybe I should pick it up this time.
6309920	6311920	Yeah, you can just borrow mine.
6311920	6312920	Really?
6312920	6313920	Because I think I will.
6313920	6315920	I haven't been playing it.
6315920	6318280	Yeah, heck yeah.
6318280	6319960	That's even cheaper than $60.
6319960	6320960	Alright.
6320960	6325880	Also, coming out very soon, like this week, Dance Central 2 is coming out.
6325880	6327480	A demo is already out on Xbox Live.
6327480	6331280	I forgot to download that and check it out, but you know, if you have a Kinect, you probably
6331280	6333920	already know what Dance Central is all about, but if you want to check out the new engine,
6333920	6337240	you can shake for free to Club Can't Handle Me.
6337240	6339640	That's the David Guetta song, right, with Florida.
6339640	6343240	And Bulletproof by LaRue.
6343240	6347560	Also, the rest of the songs for the game have been announced.
6347560	6352600	Among some of the highlights, or lowlights if you will, Justin Bieber with Somebody to
6352600	6353600	Love.
6353600	6354600	Yay.
6354600	6355600	Lady Gaga with Bad Romance.
6355600	6356600	Okay, that's cool.
6356600	6357600	Little Boots.
6357600	6358600	I like her.
6358600	6359600	That song called Metal.
6359600	6360600	That's pretty cool.
6360600	6362160	Sean Kingston with Fire Burning.
6362160	6365000	Tweet featuring Missy Elliott with Oops Oh My.
6365000	6366440	A cover version of Toxic.
6366440	6368640	I guess Britney was too good.
6368640	6374640	And coming to Dance Central 2, Willow with Whip My Hair.
6374640	6380920	So lowkey, if you're planning on buying Dance Central 2, you'll hear that song once again.
6380920	6381920	That's lame.
6381920	6382920	Before you think.
6382920	6385700	By the way, don't forget you can import all your Dance Central 1 songs into Dance Central
6385700	6386700	2.
6386700	6388560	I think there is like a, what, five or ten dollar import fee.
6388560	6389560	Five bucks.
6389560	6390560	That's not too bad, I guess.
6390560	6391560	No.
6391560	6397440	Lastly, but not leastly, this is of great importance to Orange Lounge Radio in our history.
6397440	6401880	The website WhatTheyPlay.com has closed.
6401880	6408160	I didn't know IGN owned it, but yeah, IGN owned WhatTheyPlay.com, and it is no more.
6408160	6411900	On the Facebook page, I guess it was announced, well no, because they didn't really announce
6411900	6413880	it since February, so whatever.
6413880	6418360	I guess a closure notice went up or whatever, and now it just redirects to IGN.com.
6418360	6422140	Why this is funny, you'll have to go check the Orange Lounge Radio wiki, but one of our
6422140	6429040	very first dream games we ever came up with was a game called WhatTheyPlay.com Snap, and
6429040	6430480	you know, you'll just kind of have to go read about it.
6430480	6436040	It was our own little take on very offensive things in video games, according to this website,
6436040	6438260	all in the form of Pokemon Snap.
6438260	6439260	What was it?
6439260	6442240	Wasn't it like two guys making out with a disembodied head, shouting fuck?
6442240	6445700	Like I seem to recall the thing that was like so irritating about that poll was that people
6445700	6450500	found two guys kissing more offensive than a severed head.
6450500	6457560	So somehow that led to this whole discussion about WhatTheyPlay.com Snap, be it what it
6457560	6458560	may.
6458560	6460860	I don't even know what episode that was in, but I'm sure it's all on the wiki.
6460860	6467080	The folks that update our wiki at OrangeLoungeRadio.wiki.com, they do a fantastic job archiving some of
6467080	6468080	the shows and jokes.
6468080	6469080	It's great.
6469080	6472560	Slice and Pop, what do you have for us?
6472560	6478700	Rock Band 3 is getting some new songs, mostly Rob Zombie and White Zombie, his project before
6478700	6481520	he started putting stuff out under his own name.
6481520	6485880	They're going to be available October 25th for about $2 a song.
6485880	6488960	There are four of them in this update.
6488960	6495840	For those that remember The Darkness, that kind of retro glam metal sort of kitschy gimmick
6495840	6500840	band that was popular a little while ago with that song, I Believe in a Thing Called Love.
6500840	6504840	The guy who was in the spandex jumpsuit, that song, it's a lot of fun.
6504840	6508040	I can see people getting drunk and playing Rock Band to that.
6508040	6514400	For Rob Zombie, Living Dead Girl, and then under the White Zombie name Thunder Kiss 65,
6514400	6521320	which I seem to remember was a pretty badass song, and White Zombie's Super Charger Heaven.
6521320	6525660	And also, Super Charger Heaven is often referred to as Devil Man, because that's what's in
6525660	6527000	the chorus.
6527000	6530780	I was going to ask where More Human Than Human is, but I'm like almost positive that's already
6530780	6531780	in the game.
6531780	6532780	Yeah.
6532780	6535320	Rock Band has a lot of songs.
6535320	6536960	So very cool.
6536960	6542760	In Peripheral News, if you remember that, I think it was from Famitsu Magazine a couple
6542760	6549560	weeks or months ago, the caddy for the 3DS that you pop it into, and it has an extra
6549560	6552640	right side analog thumby thing.
6552640	6557020	And people were like, well does this mean that the 3DS is going to get a new version
6557020	6558480	that doesn't have this as an add-on?
6558480	6560520	It was always going to get a new version.
6560520	6561520	Well yeah.
6561520	6562980	It's Nintendo after all.
6562980	6571440	So it was being bundled with Monster Hunter over in Japan, which is a huge Capcom franchise
6571440	6572440	over there.
6572440	6574480	I don't think it's nearly as popular over here.
6574480	6576900	But we're getting it here in the US.
6576900	6585120	They're saying that it's early 2012, whether that's Q1 or Q2 is what Capcom is forecasting.
6585120	6590360	It will be available for the Resident Evil Revelations game, which is due out February
6590360	6591360	7th of next year.
6591360	6593920	So obviously by February 7th we're going to get this thing.
6593920	6595880	Will a AAA battery be included?
6595880	6598160	Because that's what this thing runs off of apparently.
6598160	6600760	It doesn't know how to plug into your DS.
6600760	6605060	The battery life on the 3DS is already pretty bad, especially if you have something open
6605060	6611640	and then you just close the clamshell for sleep mode, your DS will die within an hour.
6611640	6617920	So my understanding is that for whether it be Resident Evil Revelations or Monster Hunter,
6617920	6623200	well it's nice to have this caddy thing with the extra right thumb analog thing that is
6623200	6625240	not mandatory.
6625240	6631680	So you can still play these games without the extra right side thing.
6631680	6635040	And if you're thinking about getting a 3DS at this point you might want to wait because
6635040	6639440	there's going to be I'm sure a redo next year that just has all this shit included.
6639440	6644280	Unless you must play Mario Kart 7 or one of the other games that's coming out soon, which
6644280	6645600	I can't say I blame you.
6645600	6647760	I'm really excited about that Mario game to be honest.
6647760	6651240	So for those of us that were, for the early adopters who thought that it was just a horrible
6651240	6653640	nightmare and you were hallucinating, no it's real.
6653640	6655520	It's real and we're getting it.
6655520	6659400	And that's what you get, I'm kidding.
6659400	6665680	Finally and I have maybe a little resentment that Rob gave me this story to report on,
6665680	6671240	but Karaoke Revolution Glee Volume 3, it's the best show ever, oh my god what's going
6671240	6677320	to happen with Mercedes, is coming out on the Xbox 360 and Wii November 22nd.
6677320	6679760	Glee, glee, glee.
6679760	6681760	Haven't the ratings for that show really dipped though?
6681760	6683360	Like people are kind of getting over it.
6683360	6688720	Like I heard that other Fox show, the Fox show with that one girl who just looks surprised,
6688720	6690560	like she looks like a deer in the headlights all that.
6690560	6691560	What's her name?
6691560	6692560	Zoe?
6692560	6693560	Zoe Deschanel.
6693560	6694560	Yes, her.
6694560	6697840	Her show is like beating glee and it comes on like after it or something.
6697840	6701640	So like glee is like it's fading fast.
6701640	6704000	It's one of those flash in the pan shows probably.
6704000	6708440	Yeah and of course Konami is putting this out obviously because it's Karaoke Revolution
6708440	6714720	and the glee merchandise I think now is, and all the licensing and the glee brand and all
6714720	6719240	the CDs and the shit that they put out is a bigger, probably it's a bigger brand than
6719240	6720920	the actual series.
6720920	6724040	All the crap that they're slapping the franchise onto.
6724040	6726320	How many Sue Silvestres are you going to see this Halloween?
6726320	6731280	And that's how Sue sees, I have to admit she was the only funny thing on that show as much
6731280	6734140	of a cartoon as that character is.
6734140	6736640	It's like the only reason to watch it.
6736640	6742320	I could care less about white kids with problems.
6742320	6744240	It was all about Sue Silvestre to me.
6744240	6747600	So yeah, glee, Karaoke Revolution, whoop to shit.
6747600	6748600	That's my last story.
6748600	6749600	All right.
6749600	6753400	And by the way, that's like the only way Karaoke Revolution lives on right now.
6753400	6758040	I think that's the funniest thing out of all of it is that Karaoke Revolution, remember
6758040	6764440	when Harmonix co-did the first Karaoke Revolution game and it was really this whole new thing?
6764440	6767640	This is what your series turned into.
6767640	6771360	Don't stop believin'.
6771360	6776540	Hey, let's travel around and get some more news.
6776540	6779280	We are also going to be coming up to the mailbag very soon.
6779280	6783880	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us your emails and Twitter topics
6783880	6788900	coming later as well as your last chance to get those in at Twitter.com slash O-L-R. So
6788900	6791440	at O-L-R on Twitter.
6791440	6792440	All right, Loki.
6792440	6798120	Well, of course, everyone's always talking about what's going to be next for the Xbox
6798120	6799120	and PlayStation.
6799120	6807200	Well, of course, the rumor is that the next Xbox system is going to be slated for 2013.
6807200	6814720	And they're saying with Nintendo revealing its Wii U console at E3, it's kind of pushed
6814720	6818160	them to release their system faster.
6818160	6828080	And apparently the site, well, the site develop is saying, their source is saying that apparently
6828080	6833320	they have a source from the processor chip manufacturers to middleware firms that they're
6833320	6842180	expecting an E3 2013 reveal of the console, followed by a launch later in the year.
6842180	6849800	And it could be as far away as early 2014, which that's almost a 10-year life cycle.
6849800	6852360	I mean, that's like eight, nine years.
6852360	6855440	Yeah, it can't really get too fussy about eight years.
6855440	6856440	That's a good run for me.
6856440	6861560	Yeah, I mean, what, the PlayStation 1 was out in two, or the PlayStation, well, the
6861560	6863440	PlayStation 1 was what, 96, 95?
6863440	6864440	Yeah, I think 95.
6864440	6865920	That was when Toshinden hit.
6865920	6868120	And then PlayStation 2 was 2001.
6868120	6869120	So that was...
6869120	6870120	No, 2000.
6870120	6871120	2000.
6871120	6872120	Okay.
6872120	6873120	It was nine...
6873120	6874120	A five-year.
6874120	6875120	Yeah.
6875120	6876120	And then to the PlayStation 2 was 2006.
6876120	6877120	God, I can't count.
6877120	6878960	PlayStation 3 was 2006.
6878960	6880320	So that was a six-year.
6880320	6884160	So if this pushes, what, seven or eight, that's pretty good.
6884160	6888200	The hardware is finally plateauing to the point where you can have sustainable graphics for
6888200	6889200	eight years.
6889200	6890200	That's great.
6890200	6894640	I think, though, that the Xbox needs it more than the PlayStation.
6894640	6898920	I still feel like the PlayStation's power hasn't been fully realized because a lot of
6898920	6899920	people have to...
6899920	6902800	I know this sounds so fanboyish, but hear me out, you guys.
6902800	6903800	Let's be real.
6903800	6906680	At the end of the day, the Blu-ray can hold more than the DVDs can.
6906680	6909440	So I think that...
6909440	6912680	I know it's slower and all that, but all those games install anyway.
6912680	6919920	But I think that once the new Xbox comes out, then the PlayStation 3 is gonna be that bottom
6919920	6920920	bar.
6920920	6923440	But I think people will be able to really fill up those discs with textures and high
6923440	6925160	resolutions and so forth.
6925160	6928840	I kind of just think the PlayStation 3 hasn't fully been realized yet.
6928840	6929840	So we'll see.
6929840	6934540	And usually the renaissance of a certain system is usually the latter three or four years
6934540	6937300	of its cycle rather than the first four.
6937300	6941160	And it's not necessarily the end of the life cycle, because they could still be considering
6941160	6942160	doing their 10-year life cycle.
6942160	6943160	It can go...
6943160	6944160	Oh, yeah.
6944160	6945160	Because it's a thing of the PS2.
6945160	6946160	Games came out for the PS2 forever.
6946160	6949200	There's still games coming out for the PS2.
6949200	6952360	So it could coexist with it for a few years after.
6952360	6956240	I wouldn't be surprised to be able to push it over 10 years.
6956240	6957240	So that's interesting.
6957240	6959080	Well, that's the theory, at least.
6959080	6963760	So I guess we'll have to wait and see, only a couple of years away before an announcement.
6963760	6966880	I would imagine we'd get an announcement sooner than later anyways.
6966880	6971360	Microsoft established with the 360 that you can actually come out first with a whole year
6971360	6973120	of head time and still win.
6973120	6974740	Well, what am I...
6974740	6979240	Why am I thinking it's between the 360 and the PS3 when the Wii has outsold both of them?
6979240	6983840	I was going to say, because usually the console that came out first was the one that fell
6983840	6984880	on its ass.
6984880	6988780	Because we're all looking at the Wii U going, you know, maybe lightning's not going to strike
6988780	6991120	twice this time.
6991120	6992120	That's why.
6992120	6993120	You know what?
6993120	6998320	Seriously, the Wii U, I'm kind of disappointed with the fact that they aren't going to try
6998320	7004000	to up the graphics to, yeah, okay, it's slightly better than 360.
7004000	7008040	It's going to have to be slightly better than that because the 360's going to be done with
7008040	7010000	by the time that it comes out.
7010000	7015880	So if it's a good system, Microsoft can have a year head star on everyone and win, ultimately,
7015880	7017440	the market.
7017440	7022600	I mean, Nintendo will have a chance, though, at next year's E3 to really wow the shit out
7022600	7023600	of us.
7023600	7027560	I mean, the nice thing about where Nintendo's going, they get a second chance.
7027560	7032240	So next year, if they can do it, they can put out games that have fucking sweet graphics
7032240	7034880	that use this whole tablet thing that just blow our fucking mind.
7034880	7035880	Like, they have a chance.
7035880	7038160	I've got a prediction for you.
7038160	7040460	It's not going to be ready for next year.
7040460	7041460	It's not going to be ready.
7041460	7042460	You think.
7042460	7043460	You're calling the Wii U delay already.
7043460	7045540	Wii U is not coming out in 2012.
7045540	7046540	You think.
7046540	7048440	And do you think it's because of its cold reception?
7048440	7049860	I think it's because they got nothing.
7049860	7050860	They have nothing.
7050860	7053080	They have a bunch of tech demos and that's it.
7053080	7054200	Proof of concept, that's it.
7054200	7055260	Here's the problem.
7055260	7060240	If the 3DS doesn't make a recovery this holiday, and I don't know, I still think it's too early
7060240	7061240	to say.
7061240	7063840	The Wii U, the Mario Kart, and the Mario games are going to go a long way in putting these
7063840	7066000	things under kids' Christmas trees this year.
7066000	7071200	But if the 3DS doesn't gain a lot of steam quickly, what are they going to have next
7071200	7073200	year?
7073200	7075140	Nothing.
7075140	7078640	It's going to really put pressure on to get the Wii U out or they're going to have to
7078640	7080440	give in to investors and start making iPhone games.
7080440	7081440	Yeah.
7081440	7082440	But see, when they're going to be...
7082440	7083440	Yeah, but that's the thing.
7083440	7087780	If they're going to rush the Wii U, come on.
7087780	7091080	We're going to see these games that, oh, we were developing this for the Wii, but we decided
7091080	7095360	to put it on the Wii U type situation.
7095360	7096360	And I know that...
7096360	7097360	Like the last story.
7097360	7104040	Nintendo has been the more family-friendly, affordable model since, really, the N64.
7104040	7107520	I don't like the fact that the tablet controller is a terminal.
7107520	7109320	It doesn't have any processor in it.
7109320	7111280	It's simply a screen.
7111280	7115000	I think Nintendo needs to realize that people are fucking buying iPads for their goddamn
7115000	7117560	kids and iPads aren't fucking cheap.
7117560	7121120	You can make your console more expensive and people will still buy it.
7121120	7122680	They're not going to go, oh my god.
7122680	7123680	Don't give them too many ideas.
7123680	7128760	Well, I understand that, but I'm just saying, you know, if you're buying a fucking $200
7128760	7136680	piece of equipment for your child, I mean, shit, I think they will spend $300 on a console.
7136680	7141960	Brad from PotCulture's in our chat room and wants me to make a bet with Loki.
7141960	7142960	Stop it.
7142960	7143960	Stop it, okay?
7143960	7147280	You had your chance and you blew it.
7147280	7154240	All you had to do was generate a few sales, a few hundred thousand sales of, you know,
7154240	7158200	I have judgment, and that was it, and then you would have had it.
7158200	7164880	But see, the Wii U does sound ridiculous, but once again, it's something like, all these
7164880	7166480	developers are so excited.
7166480	7171640	I think that these developers seriously don't get enough sun because it's, oh wow, it's
7171640	7172640	a tablet that interacts-
7172640	7174480	Do you think they all have vitamin D deficiencies?
7174480	7177520	It's like it's a tablet that interacts with this console.
7177520	7179640	Dude, they've got like tablets-
7179640	7181560	And the tablet does shit by itself.
7181560	7184560	You need the console tethered to it.
7184560	7185840	But you know what, though?
7185840	7191960	It's not, you say that like it's a bad thing, but look at like, you know, the on-live stuff.
7191960	7197920	It's a console that interacts with a server that basically streams the gaming to it.
7197920	7198920	True.
7198920	7200180	That's the same thing.
7200180	7205000	But once again, I'm like, that tablet looks stupid.
7205000	7209520	And yeah, ooh goody, we can put my, you know, my inventory down on this.
7209520	7213380	You know what, you could do that also with the 3, you know, the DS or something.
7213380	7217640	You can have it where it interacts with the actual consoles on, you know, the DS could
7217640	7218640	do that.
7218640	7220520	Same with the 3DS could do that.
7220520	7222440	But they didn't fucking do that.
7222440	7229200	I don't know, it's just, they're gonna need a lot more than what they've got.
7229200	7234480	Alright, let's move on to a game that's supposed to be on the Wii U when it comes out.
7234480	7235480	Arkham City.
7235480	7238280	Now, people have been going apeshit for this game.
7238280	7242440	I haven't played it, but I've watched Dan play a little bit of it.
7242440	7244560	And it did look pretty fucking sweet, I gotta say.
7244560	7246160	And like, you know, I like Batman.
7246160	7250360	I don't know why I didn't buy this game at launch, but I guess I'm just not, I'm not
7250360	7254120	usually very good at the 3D action games, I think that's kind of part of it.
7254120	7259000	But there's a part of me that's going kind of want with this game.
7259000	7263960	But then I read this crap, and I go, maybe I shouldn't buy it right away.
7263960	7267840	Remember how we've been talking about Project $10 applies to this game, and it's not even
7267840	7268840	multiplayer.
7268840	7269840	No, they've done the Catwoman.
7269840	7271900	Well, they have to run the servers!
7271900	7274560	You understand, they have to run the servers!
7274560	7275560	Think of the servers!
7275560	7278720	You know what really, the only thing that ticks me off about the whole thing is that
7278720	7283160	they really made Catwoman sound like she was an integral part of the game, and like it's
7283160	7284160	all part of it.
7284160	7285760	And now it's DLC.
7285760	7287000	You know, essentially.
7287000	7291120	Which I'm fine, you know, it's not like it's the first time we've seen a game come with
7291120	7292380	DLC in it.
7292380	7293880	That happens a lot now.
7293880	7299240	You know, it's just the whole, you know, buy the game new incentive, whatever.
7299240	7302240	But paid unlocked content, because that was a key.
7302240	7306800	No, I don't, I think it's like a, I was listening to Bobby show earlier, and one of his callers
7306800	7308720	said it was a 200 megabyte download.
7308720	7309720	Really?
7309720	7310720	Yeah.
7310720	7312080	So it must come with others, alright.
7312080	7314160	Do some investigative reporting, Loki.
7314160	7316260	Meanwhile, okay, here's the deal.
7316260	7319200	The thing that kind of, you know, ticked me off and made me go, maybe I shouldn't have
7319200	7320200	rushed into this.
7320200	7324080	Apparently, those download codes are showing up, and they don't work.
7324080	7326840	Some of them don't work, some of them are just fucking blank.
7326840	7330780	And there's a picture circulating around the internet of cards that went into boxes with
7330780	7332280	no codes on them.
7332280	7336160	And actually, from a factory production standpoint, this makes a lot of sense.
7336160	7339560	They probably have an assembly line and a machine that picks up these cards and runs
7339560	7343640	them through a printer, and the machine probably, if it picks up two at a time on accident,
7343640	7344960	which is bound to happen.
7344960	7347880	Why this ever can't happen to me at the ATM machine, I don't know.
7347880	7351840	But in the factory, it picks up two at a time, and then one of them doesn't get a code, yet
7351840	7353440	still goes in the game.
7353440	7354800	So yeah.
7354800	7358280	So it was going out there, and these people that were looking forward to playing as Catwoman
7358280	7359680	were kind of screwed.
7359680	7363960	However, Warner does have a five-step process to get this fixed.
7363960	7365120	Alright, fair enough.
7365120	7366880	It was a couple hundred meg download.
7366880	7367880	Alright.
7367880	7368880	So be it.
7368880	7372880	Alright, so apparently you call customer service, and you give them a dated proof of purchase,
7372880	7377680	like a receipt, that shows a new copy of the game, not eBay or not rented.
7377680	7382920	You have to give your gamer tag for Xbox Live or PSN, you have to give your email address,
7382920	7387840	a scan or digital picture of the package and game disk, and the scan or digital picture
7387840	7388840	of the code sheet.
7388840	7391280	Once you send all that in, they'll give you the code.
7391280	7393480	That's a lot of work for their mistake.
7393480	7394880	I know, right?
7394880	7397320	I seem to recall last time a developer fucked up.
7397320	7399480	Wasn't it Deus Ex that had this problem?
7399480	7404520	One of those had a code, and it got fucked up, so they just ended up having to give it
7404520	7405520	to everybody.
7405520	7406520	It was Driver.
7406520	7407520	It was Driver.
7407520	7408520	It was Driver.
7408520	7410520	Driver, they forgot to put the code in one of the packages.
7410520	7415080	I think it was 360 or PS3, I can't remember, it was one of those two.
7415080	7419880	They forgot to put in the Uplay code.
7419880	7424360	But this is apparently like, people, this is going back to the days of when people would
7424360	7428320	call in sick to work and stay up all night to play a video game.
7428320	7430680	This game is having that effect on people.
7430680	7435880	People that I know that aren't even that into video games are just going apeshit crazy over
7435880	7436880	this.
7436880	7442360	And trust me, people, if you really want to get this free code and maybe purchase a used
7442360	7448840	copy already, I mean, come on, you need a picture of the packed shot and a receipt?
7448840	7452240	I think we can find one on Google Image Search.
7452240	7453720	I love this.
7453720	7458600	Tigerclaw linked a picture in chatroom of a midnight launch at his local Evil G, and
7458600	7463320	one of the employees is dressed up as the Joker with the why so serious makeup.
7463320	7467160	At least people are getting into it.
7467160	7468160	Lol.
7468160	7470240	Shame on you for giving that place your business.
7470240	7471800	I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
7471800	7476260	This is where I'm going to get in my sandbox once again about this whole code crap.
7476260	7482160	So I would like to pose this question, and I'm sure no developers of these types of games
7482160	7486540	actually listen to this show, but maybe after we hopefully win the podcast awards, someone
7486540	7490800	will go back in the archives and hear my rant.
7490800	7498200	So I always hear the complaint, or I should say the argument from people in favor of these
7498200	7505240	$10 codes and online passes and stuff, well, the developers don't get any money from used
7505240	7506240	sales.
7506240	7510760	They just don't get any money, and those servers cost money to maintain blah blah blah blah
7510760	7511760	blah.
7511760	7515520	Okay, developers, how much of that $10 do you actually get?
7515520	7521800	Because I'm going to be willing to bet that you get nothing from those $10 vouchers that
7521800	7524340	get redeemed or whatever.
7524340	7530760	I'm betting it's $0 is what you get, and it all goes to the publisher to pad their numbers,
7530760	7535060	and yeah, some of that I'm sure will go to running their servers, because hey, if you
7535060	7540280	can run your servers cheaper than you are now, then why not?
7540280	7546920	But I mean, it's just an excuse, and no, I'm sure buying these games used is not going
7546920	7553240	to make or break a publisher as far as that goes, because I'm being willing to bet that
7553240	7557520	none of that money goes to the developers, all probably to the publishers.
7557520	7558520	You want proof.
7558520	7560560	I want to see the receipts.
7560560	7565400	I want someone to say, hey, we get a buck for each time someone buys this thing.
7565400	7567960	That's what I'd like to see, but I doubt it.
7567960	7571000	I doubt that they get very much money from that.
7571000	7572720	All right.
7572720	7575220	Let's move on to the mailbag.
7575220	7579780	Every week you guys send us emails at mailbag at orangelauncheradio.com.
7579780	7584000	Now normally DarkSakura will dive into the email bag head first and pull out some of
7584000	7585840	her favorite emails to read on air.
7585840	7591000	However, as you guys are aware, she's not here tonight, so she has asked SalaciousPop
7591000	7595040	to put on the biohazard suit and jump in there on her behalf.
7595040	7598280	So SalaciousPop, what's in the emails tonight?
7598280	7603260	First email tonight is from Robert M and he writes, evening, you probably already got
7603260	7608680	feedback about this, but the free downloadable Zelda Four Swords is not a 3DS exclusive,
7608680	7611800	but it's available on the DSI models as well.
7611800	7616040	I am very glad to see that they added a single player mode, allowing the player to have a
7616040	7619880	second link, follow him around and switch control to either character.
7619880	7624020	Overall this is the kind of effort Nintendo should be putting into its rereleases.
7624020	7627440	Now onto toys!
7627440	7634560	I have had and not had an interest in Spyro since the Insomniac days, and while I sympathize
7634560	7640480	with the storage issues and definitely the high buy-in, the concept of Skylander seems
7640480	7645800	kind of cool, even though I'm sure the game itself would probably be fairly simplistic.
7645800	7650980	I've seen other game-slash-toys like this, although those were probably an in-package
7650980	7655560	code rather than direct peripheral transfer of memory.
7655560	7660240	Some online racing games with toy cars, and some MMO called Freaky Creatures whose action
7660240	7662200	figures I've seen at Best Buy.
7662200	7665480	I haven't seen either of these in stores for a while though.
7665480	7669840	I haven't seen as much integration with my Transformers action figures, a line here and
7669840	7674880	there may have a catalog with a code for an unlockable in one of the games, but these
7674880	7677880	are rare and all the catalogs have the same code.
7677880	7683440	My question is, have you seen a more successful toy game integration?
7683440	7688920	Would you call those music games toys, like the plastic guitars, are those toys?
7688920	7690920	It kind of depends on your definition of toy.
7690920	7697880	Well I think what he's asking is, what was that card game for the Sony that bombed that
7697880	7698880	never came out?
7698880	7699880	Eye of Judgment?
7699880	7701460	Yeah, Eye of Judgment.
7701460	7705640	That's where you're kind of buying a physical thing to bring into the game.
7705640	7708560	With the Skylanders you have to find these little action figures to play that character
7708560	7709560	in the game.
7709560	7711560	So what have there been that's similar to that?
7711560	7716780	Well you have to go from the disc generations forward because obviously with the cartridge
7716780	7719000	scenario that just didn't happen.
7719000	7725500	I remember old school VCR games that tied in with toys, but that stuff didn't work very
7725500	7729560	well and it was all just for show in the commercials and stuff.
7729560	7734160	But as far as toys with games, I'm not sure.
7734160	7738520	And Loki, can you think of anything, any type of, like where they sold toys that integrated
7738520	7740040	with the game like this does?
7740040	7741040	That integrated the game?
7741040	7742040	Yeah.
7742040	7748640	Connectimals, they had little scans where you can basically interact with different,
7748640	7752240	you know, you can buy toys, or they had collector's editions that came with stuffed animals they
7752240	7754840	could play with the actual game with.
7754840	7758040	Viva Pinata had some stuff.
7758040	7759040	Did Viva Pinata have that?
7759040	7761320	Yeah, they had a little thing where you could scan your...
7761320	7765200	Yeah, they so tried to make Viva Pinata happen.
7765200	7767380	They tried, it wasn't going to happen.
7767380	7770520	Some people enjoyed it, some people really did, but like remember they had the cartoon,
7770520	7773960	they were really trying to make an empire out of that and it just...
7773960	7778320	If you want to count Babysitting Mama, because Babysitting Mama had the doll that you shoved
7778320	7783640	the Wii remote up into its nether regions and would interact that way.
7783640	7787120	Don't worry, Mama will fix it.
7787120	7788600	Let's see, what else?
7788600	7789600	There was...
7789600	7793280	Cat rooms yelling Captain Power, I think that's what they're thinking of the VCR stuff I'm
7793280	7794280	talking about.
7794280	7795280	Oh, wow.
7795280	7796280	Right?
7796280	7797940	Yeah, I remember that.
7797940	7799640	That was kind of like a rich kid's toy.
7799640	7801760	That shit was, well that shit was cheap as hell, though.
7801760	7810320	I didn't ever own one, but you know, I had the rich friends, and so, you know, they did.
7810320	7814460	That's what you do when you're poor, you make friends with rich people.
7814460	7816400	Through your sass and wit.
7816400	7821640	Alright, Salacious Pop, what's next?
7821640	7829080	Chiggers writes asking, rather, asking Dark Sakura, who's not here, an update on her PlayStation
7829080	7830320	tester application.
7830320	7833880	I can actually give you that, even though Dark Sakura's not here tonight.
7833880	7837680	She decided not to go through with it, and it was a discussion between her and Dan about
7837680	7840900	the whole, like, if I actually got it, I have to relocate.
7840900	7843600	Keep in mind, Dan just recently got employed again.
7843600	7847760	He was working a game crazy up until they all went under, and he's employed again, so
7847760	7851800	they made a personal decision that it's just not the right time for Dark Sakura to do that.
7851800	7856040	As funny as it would have been, she has to think not just for herself.
7856040	7861720	You know, she has a husband, so they didn't go through with it, which is too bad.
7861720	7864800	Unfortunately, Salacious Pop's application got in too late, right?
7864800	7866680	No, I'm just kidding.
7866680	7867680	Just messing.
7867680	7871440	I just want to see you go on that show and claw some 21-year-old's eyes out for being
7871440	7872440	a bitch.
7872440	7874240	Yeah, I'm probably too old.
7874240	7875240	I'm sure it's like on...
7875240	7876240	You'd be Grandpa on that show.
7876240	7877240	Because on the...
7877240	7882480	There's usually one or two people in their 30s that are in the cast somehow, but yeah.
7882480	7889480	They have one that I watched just because, and it was just the part of it, because Freddie
7889480	7893120	Wong is in it briefly.
7893120	7896480	He posted it on his Facebook page, but it's like some battlefield thing called the Controller.
7896480	7901240	It's a bunch of these noobs team up with, like, these pro gamers, and they have to play
7901240	7902560	Battlefield 3.
7902560	7905000	It's basically a big advertisement for Battlefield 3.
7905000	7909960	But yeah, all those shows are dumb.
7909960	7912520	Tester.
7912520	7914680	You can test games for the PlayStation 4!
7914680	7917200	No, remember, the next one had a different prize.
7917200	7919840	It's not about just the game testing now.
7919840	7921780	They sweetened the deal a little bit.
7921780	7923280	The prize sounds a lot better.
7923280	7926520	And we'll kick you in the nuts!
7926520	7929240	I don't know what happened to the second guy that won.
7929240	7930840	I know a gay guy won the second season.
7930840	7932960	His handle was, like, gamer.
7932960	7936000	And I haven't heard a lot about what happened to him, but I knew the guy that won the first
7936000	7940760	season actually only tested for, like, six months, and he moved into the part at Sony
7940760	7942920	that he really wanted to do.
7942920	7945660	That whole thing was really about just getting your foot in the damn door.
7945660	7948800	But I'd be curious about did they hire anyone else from the shows.
7948800	7951960	You know how sometimes, like, American Idol, right?
7951960	7953160	Chris Daughtry didn't win.
7953160	7955800	If you're in the top three, you're getting a record deal.
7955800	7956800	Exactly.
7956800	7957800	Exactly.
7957800	7958800	Yeah.
7958800	7964040	Uh, next email is from Jam J. Jam J writes, Holy shit, I haven't heard that name in forever.
7964040	7967080	That guy used to show up live a lot.
7967080	7976080	This week, I picked up Rocksmith for the 360, a, uh, I'm not sure, a 14 to USB connector
7976080	7978080	for the guitar was included.
7978080	7983440	My thoughts on the game itself is that it is more of a training slash drill tool than
7983440	7987280	game, and then parentheses, number cruncher, or number munchers.
7987280	7992220	For many, this would be a turnoff, but as an extreme novice at guitar, I found it was
7992220	7996120	decent and made otherwise boring practice a bit better.
7996120	8000660	The game functions as an amplifier for the guitar and has a free mode where you can just
8000660	8002280	free play your guitar.
8002280	8006120	I would recommend Rocksmith for those that want to learn a bit of guitar, but aren't
8006120	8010520	taking normal lessons or excuse me, aren't taking formal lessons.
8010520	8014700	One of the drawbacks is that you have to grind songs repetitively, repetitively in order
8014700	8016360	to open up new modes.
8016360	8019840	However, it does make you practice.
8019840	8024180	After the 30 minutes of, after the 30 minutes of starting the game, I found I was able to
8024180	8029120	play a simplified version of Satisfaction, which wasn't bad at all.
8029120	8032320	I used a basic Strat style electric guitar.
8032320	8035920	Rocksmith will work with any electric guitar with a quarter, oh, that's probably a quarter
8035920	8038120	inch, with a quarter inch jack.
8038120	8042720	I give this game the Tomato Frog stamp of approval for learning basic guitar.
8042720	8043720	GMJ.
8043720	8045640	Well, that actually is not a bad review.
8045640	8050240	You know, I like that he says it's more of a tool than a game.
8050240	8055280	And I'd be curious to see how much this catches on, if at all.
8055280	8059840	I mean, I think people are like, they're just too ready to throw it into the rock band and
8059840	8062680	guitar hero pile than to see what it really is.
8062680	8066840	But I appreciate the review because this was something that I don't, I gotta admit, I don't
8066840	8070880	really have a super duper interest in learning to play the guitar, but it sounds like a neat
8070880	8072120	way to learn.
8072120	8077480	I'm more of a keyboard person, keep in mind, piano, that stuff.
8077480	8083760	And our last email of the evening is from Fabrice in Belgium and he writes, hello, OLR.
8083760	8087160	I love international emails, just saying.
8087160	8091720	I went to my very first sci-fi convention last Saturday and it was simply amazing.
8091720	8094340	The people cosplaying just blew my mind away.
8094340	8099080	Most of their costumes were made that well and they played their part with so much conviction.
8099080	8102000	Wow, it really made a big impression on me.
8102000	8106880	The overall atmosphere and friendship between cosplayers made me, made me consider to cosplay
8106880	8107880	myself.
8107880	8112520	I didn't see anyone cosplaying Pyramid Head, I'm thinking about filling up that gap next
8112520	8114560	year on this convention.
8114560	8118640	Although I don't know too much about him, I've never had a chance, I've never had a
8118640	8120040	chance to play Silent Hill.
8120040	8122920	He looks like such a badass character.
8122920	8124760	And then I have Halloween's coming.
8124760	8126680	You really should check out Silent Hill, just saying.
8126680	8128700	I have something to whine about too.
8128700	8132500	It seems that every single game has downloadable content nowadays.
8132500	8137640	As I was randomly going through the Xbox Live Marketplace, I saw there was even downloadable
8137640	8141720	content for such a small and simple game as Fruit Ninja Connect.
8141720	8145720	I do get that developers and publishers want to make some more extra money, but it's just
8145720	8146720	crazy.
8146720	8150080	It feels more and more like content that should be included in the game when you first buy
8150080	8152280	it.
8152280	8156400	In two years time, if this trend continues, we will only buy half games for the full price.
8156400	8160160	I hate to say it, this trend's already been going for a long time, and a lot of this is,
8160160	8162640	you know, IOS has a lot of this too.
8162640	8166040	This is just kind of the world we live in right now, and you really have to vote with
8166040	8167080	your dollars.
8167080	8169040	Don't buy half-assed games.
8169040	8170040	Don't.
8170040	8171040	Do your research.
8171040	8174220	Well, as always, thanks a lot for making the show every week.
8174220	8175480	You guys really are awesome.
8175480	8178640	I'm voting almost every day for you guys for the podcast awards.
8178640	8180320	That's the least I can do for you.
8180320	8181680	Aw, shucks.
8181680	8182680	Shucks.
8182680	8183680	Thanks so much.
8183680	8184680	Fabrice in Belgium.
8184680	8185720	Really appreciate it, Fabrice.
8185720	8189160	You know, his story about the sci-fi convention and all the excitement that kind of went with
8189160	8190160	that and kind of...
8190160	8192780	I bet a lot of that excitement is just being with other nerds.
8192780	8197560	I know that, like, my first E3 was a lot like that, was, like, all these professional people
8197560	8199960	that really happen to be, like, big fucking nerds like me.
8199960	8200960	Like, I just...
8200960	8204800	I loved my first E3, and I don't think I'll ever go to one as good as that because of
8204800	8205800	that.
8205800	8208360	But, like, it just reminded me of some other thing I read this week.
8208360	8209360	Did you see...
8209360	8210360	Here I go.
8210360	8211360	Opening Pandora's box.
8211360	8212360	Woo!
8212360	8213360	There was some magazine.
8213360	8217560	It was Men's Health that did this piece on New York Comic-Con, and they just basically
8217560	8221200	sent a photographer there to take pictures of fat cosplayers to put it on their website
8221200	8222200	and make fun of them.
8222200	8227040	Like, you know, guys dressed as Captain America or something like that that have, like, the
8227040	8230400	beer bellies and things like that, and I was just like...
8230400	8232880	It's obviously Men's Health, so I don't know if they're just trying to make people feel
8232880	8236560	bad about themselves, so they'll subscribe to the magazine to, I don't know, get health
8236560	8239660	tips, but the whole thing just came off as hella fucking rude.
8239660	8243960	And like, you know, obviously Twitter and the internet, rightfully so, is pissed and
8243960	8244960	demanding an apology.
8244960	8246080	I don't know if they ever got one.
8246080	8254000	I didn't follow the story that much, but it's just, ugh, just so classless, like, but it's
8254000	8257800	just all reason not to get that magazine, I suppose, that they're just gonna be rude
8257800	8258800	like that.
8258800	8264240	Like, who even in a boardroom, I mean, office, or a story editor, thinks that's funny.
8264240	8269000	Let's go to New York Comic-Con and take pictures of fat people, and we'll put them in the magazine.
8269000	8271920	That's like what the bullies did in high school.
8271920	8275400	Let's go pick on the fags and put them in the trash can, huh huh.
8275400	8278580	It's just ridiculous.
8278580	8281560	Shame on everybody involved with that.
8281560	8286840	And to the people that have the guts to dress up like in tights when they may not have perfect
8286840	8289320	bodies, I say props to you.
8289320	8292680	Props to you for having the guts to get out there and do that, because those people that
8292680	8295800	write for the magazines often won't even put their fucking pictures in the mag.
8295800	8298160	Let's see a picture of the guy that wrote that article, see what he looks like.
8298160	8301480	I bet he's not perfect.
8301480	8302800	And then one last thing.
8302800	8309480	We did get your email, DKPopman, and also a shout out for The Doctor 90125, but what
8309480	8312720	you talked about is actually coming up in just a few minutes, but we got your email.
8312720	8313720	Hello, DKPopman.
8313720	8315560	Well, hello and thank you.
8315560	8321520	We always don't have time to write, do every email either, and I think that's important
8321520	8322520	to keep in mind.
8322520	8323520	That's it for mailbag.
8323520	8324520	But we do read them all.
8324520	8325520	Thank you.
8325520	8330320	I just posted that actually his show, Anime Jam Session, a friend of ours, actually wrote
8330320	8332940	this whole counter article to it.
8332940	8334240	I'm not going to reread the whole thing.
8334240	8335720	He's posted it in chat.
8335720	8339040	The whole thing is infuriating enough where I really don't want to spend any more time
8339040	8345000	talking about it, but if you just want to see reasons why you should be mad, go read
8345000	8347040	it.
8347040	8354960	You don't have to be fat to support fat rights, because how does that old saying go?
8354960	8360680	At first they didn't come for me, and I said nothing, and then they came for me and no
8360680	8361680	one said anything.
8361680	8362680	Something like that.
8362680	8364800	Somebody in chat will remind me what that is.
8364800	8369480	Alright, anyhow, let's move on with some more news.
8369480	8378080	It's hard to believe that this damn thing is so popular, but Angry Birds.
8378080	8383600	They're getting a film, and why?
8383600	8389040	Did they really run out of that many ideas that they have to create a movie based on
8389040	8390040	this game?
8390040	8393640	It doesn't make any sense, but anyways, the game's been downloaded over 400 million times,
8393640	8399680	so they probably think, hey, you know what, let me make some money off that movie.
8399680	8406760	And of course, their revenue, Rovio was currently valued at 1.2 billion dollars, which is ridiculous.
8406760	8410120	Ridiculous, I say.
8410120	8417120	And to kind of go along with that, Ubisoft, they have a wonderful franchise called Assassin's
8417120	8422280	Creed, and Sony has apparently bought the rights to make a movie based on it, and this
8422280	8430480	is coming from also the fact that Sony has just recently started registering a bunch
8430480	8438120	of websites for an Assassin's Creed movie, so that's a good indicator.
8438120	8439680	Assassin's Creed might make a pretty good movie.
8439680	8442760	I think it could, because it actually has a pretty decent storyline to go along with
8442760	8444640	it, so I can see that.
8444640	8447080	I see it more so than Angry Birds, that's for sure.
8447080	8449960	Angry Birds has no plot, other than, you know, it's just-
8449960	8451200	They're mad at pigs.
8451200	8457400	There's pigs, and they did something that angered the birds, and so you launch, I mean,
8457400	8460680	I don't want to watch a movie where it's just birds flinging themselves at walls all
8460680	8461680	movie long.
8461680	8466560	I remember growing up in the 80s when Saturday morning cartoons were a thing, and you had
8466560	8471200	these really awful Saturday morning cartoons that were only on for a season that promoted
8471200	8474480	the toys, and the toys were there to promote the cartoon.
8474480	8478400	Why not just have an Angry Birds cartoon, right?
8478400	8479840	I mean-
8479840	8481720	Makes sense.
8481720	8488000	But again, little kids don't have $400 smartphones to play the damn game on, but yeah, it's like,
8488000	8489000	why can't you just-
8489000	8491360	But you can play the game on almost everything now.
8491360	8495080	Well yeah, it's on Google Plus, and the port on Google Plus is actually pretty good, but
8495080	8498680	it's like, I just remember, why can't you just make a cartoon series to sell some plastic
8498680	8500240	shit and be done with it?
8500240	8503240	I don't know why it needs a movie.
8503240	8504240	That's all.
8504240	8510000	Well, hearing about Angry Birds movies make me angry, and when we get angry, we rage,
8510000	8526320	and it's the F-You's of the Week.
8526320	8540080	Sure, I guess, um, F-You to waking up with headaches, which is weird, because it's like
8540080	8541080	I was asleep, I should feel awesome if I have a headache.
8541080	8544080	It got better, though, after once I got to brunch and ate, so just headaches are annoying.
8544080	8545640	They make me sad.
8545640	8546640	Headaches suck.
8546640	8547640	I agree.
8547640	8548640	Yeah.
8548640	8549640	Loki!
8549640	8553440	F-You to waiting.
8553440	8554440	Wait longer.
8554440	8555440	No!
8555440	8560160	He wants to get home right now and go hunting for some stuff.
8560160	8565560	Alright, uh, my F-You of the Week goes to the fact that, um, well look, here's the deal.
8565560	8567760	I'm never gonna pay to go to BlizzCon.
8567760	8572640	Like, let's be real, I'm not gonna pay to go play a couple of demos.
8572640	8573640	Like, what do they want?
8573640	8578120	About 150 bucks and sit on panels that I can read live blogs on the internet for free.
8578120	8582360	However, F-You to the fact that I wasn't smart enough to take the time off anyway to drive
8582360	8588400	down to Anaheim and go to DizCon, which was today, and, uh, just go to the parties.
8588400	8589400	Like, seriously.
8589400	8590960	Like, slices pop, am I right?
8590960	8595000	We should've just gone to Disneyland Friday, Saturday, and then went to the BlizzCon parties
8595000	8596000	at night, right?
8596000	8597000	Yeah.
8597000	8598000	Totally.
8598000	8599000	We're so stupid!
8599000	8604680	Oops, I'm so mad that the frickin' outro's playing now.
8604680	8607760	Alright.
8607760	8611240	Let's move on with some more gaming news and then of course Twitter topics and the Skype
8611240	8613200	line coming very soon.
8613200	8616600	Uh, 3D Classics is this thing on the 3DS.
8616600	8620320	You know, they redid Excitebike and, like, Urban Champion for some weird reason and there's
8620320	8622440	been some other things in there as well, like Twinbee.
8622440	8625920	Uh, apparently the next game that will be out for 3D Classics, this is kind of a big
8625920	8626920	one.
8626920	8627920	Kid Icarus.
8627920	8629760	The old school classic, that's right.
8629760	8632560	This one is being, uh, done in 3D.
8632560	8635640	Now of course that just means, you know, some of the sprites will be on different layers
8635640	8640060	and eh, I don't think it'll be that big of a deal, but it's probably just being re-released
8640060	8644320	to kind of raise awareness because of course they do have the Kid Icarus game coming out
8644320	8646640	next year, so there you go.
8646640	8650120	Nintendo has also pledged that they will be increasing the amount of 3D Classics that
8650120	8651160	we see.
8651160	8652860	Why not?
8652860	8656960	It's super easy to program these, I'm sure, and it's a way to get you to buy virtual console
8656960	8658320	games all over again.
8658320	8662640	It's like, do I really need to be reminded how bloody hard that game was?
8662640	8664320	But seriously, that game is so fucking good.
8664320	8668280	Like I know some people say you remember it through rose-colored glasses and it's not
8668280	8671200	that good, but like, the music is amazing.
8671200	8674360	The dungeon levels are hard as hell and they're fun.
8674360	8677040	Like, I'm just worried that- I had to use the codes out in Nintendo Power
8677040	8678960	Magazine to get any progress in that game.
8678960	8681920	Icarus fights Medusa Angels, or whatever it is.
8681920	8685360	Medusa fights Icarus Angels, you get the reverse.
8685360	8688240	My whole thing is that I'm really worried that if I were to purchase this, that the
8688240	8692360	first time I get fucked over by an eggplant wizard, I'm gonna throw my 3DS against the
8692360	8695200	wall like I used to throw my Nintendo controllers.
8695200	8698840	Because those eggplant wizards are fucking bastards.
8698840	8706120	And that music that plays when they get mad and they're like, you trolled me, yeah!
8706120	8707120	Oh my god.
8707120	8709280	Did you play a lot of Kid Icarus when you were younger?
8709280	8710280	Oh yeah.
8710280	8711280	Flash's Pop?
8711280	8712280	Yeah.
8712280	8713280	Oh god, it's one of my favorites.
8713280	8714280	That's what I played.
8714280	8716600	I completely missed the original Metroid train for the NES and I was playing Kid Icarus instead.
8716600	8717640	Wait, here you go.
8717640	8719800	Let's see if this music makes you think of the eggplant wizards.
8719800	8720800	Oh god.
8720800	8721800	You ready?
8721800	8725360	I'm ready.
8725360	8733000	That little sound they made, right?
8733000	8737600	Yeah, when they saw you, they were very animated and upset and they squeaked at you.
8737600	8739040	And the little babies flew out.
8739040	8741920	And then you had to go see that nurse who kind of looked like a trapezoid.
8741920	8746400	Like what was up with that?
8746400	8747400	Nurse trapezoid.
8747400	8750040	I need the eggplant curse removed.
8750040	8755400	Alright, anyhow, Flash's Pop, what do you have for us?
8755400	8762560	Soulcalibur V is getting a crossover franchise tie-in that makes sense and it's not Star
8762560	8765560	Wars with Vader and Yoda and it's so good.
8765560	8768360	I gotta say, Starkiller was awesome though in the game.
8768360	8770840	Yeah, well, he's a nice looking gentleman.
8770840	8772640	He's based off a real person, isn't he?
8772640	8775880	Sam Witwer, the actor, yeah, is Starkiller.
8775880	8777880	But anyway.
8777880	8781600	How often are you thinking about this guy?
8781600	8783200	Tapping my fingers on the desk.
8783200	8790280	Enzo from Assassin's Creed, the last few Assassin's Creed games, is in Soulcalibur V and it looks
8790280	8795440	super badass and he fits in stylistically with everyone.
8795440	8799160	It was one of those things when they announced that, I was like, oh, I didn't think of that.
8799160	8800160	But it makes sense.
8800160	8805600	It's better than Kratos in Mortal Kombat and even that was reasonable.
8805600	8810920	So yeah, Enzo is in Soulcalibur V, it's confirmed, I believe there are screenshots.
8810920	8816000	And there's another little promotional tidbit that they've released for us.
8816000	8824480	There is a special pre-order bonus character named Dump here and he is very wacky and silly.
8824480	8832920	He's kind of a vaudeville circus MC with a hat and sort of like a villainous, the curly
8832920	8839040	mustache that ties the damsel in distress on the railroad tracks.
8839040	8843920	And he's got striped pants and he's very nutty.
8843920	8847720	And you should watch the gameplay trailer of him doing his moves and it's like, this
8847720	8849520	guy is nuts.
8849520	8851520	But you get to make your own characters again, right?
8851520	8852520	I believe so.
8852520	8854320	Because I remember, was it Soulcalibur III or IV?
8854320	8855320	I think it was you, Loki.
8855320	8857760	It must have been III because it must have been back when we were living together when
8857760	8861760	Soulcalibur III came out and you made that character named Benedict that looked like
8861760	8862760	the poet.
8862760	8863760	Well, that wasn't you.
8863760	8864760	I thought that was.
8864760	8865760	Was that X-Defer?
8865760	8866760	It must have been X-Defer then.
8866760	8867760	Why did I think it was you, Loki?
8867760	8868760	I get you and X-Defer confused.
8868760	8872720	I don't know how that's even possible.
8872720	8874080	Good times.
8874080	8880760	And he kind of reminds me of a silly character from Street Fighter IV who I hate, the big
8880760	8885260	giant large guy with Rufus Rufus with the balloon belly.
8885260	8886260	He's the American character.
8886260	8888320	Like this is just Capcom being silly.
8888320	8894040	This guy to me is that but done in a way that isn't totally stupid.
8894040	8895040	Rufus has fans though.
8895040	8898920	Rufus is going to be in the Street Fighter X Tekken game.
8898920	8904800	Well that makes sense, I think, but yeah, so Enzo, awesome, and this weird wacky circus
8904800	8908120	vaudeville guy, Dampier, if you pre-order the game.
8908120	8912080	And that, when is, I think I had a release date here for when that game was coming out.
8912080	8913080	Next year.
8913080	8914080	Yeah, next year.
8914080	8915080	January 31st.
8915080	8916080	Don't want to say.
8916080	8917080	Near the beginning of the year.
8917080	8920240	So Soul Calibur fans rejoice.
8920240	8921720	We'll be buying that, just so you know.
8921720	8922720	Yeah.
8922720	8923720	I played the hell out of IV.
8923720	8926520	Soul Calibur is like my favorite fighting game franchise, so that's going to be awesome.
8926520	8927520	I can't wait.
8927520	8930240	In fact, we should start playing Soul Calibur IV again in anticipation.
8930240	8931720	I have it on 360.
8931720	8932720	Good times.
8932720	8936000	I never did buy Vader though.
8936000	8939680	For modded consoles, they have a topless version available.
8939680	8940680	Of course.
8940680	8941680	Of course.
8941680	8942680	Yeah, I have-
8942680	8944160	Ivy's like two pixels away from being topless.
8944160	8947920	I have Yoda and Vader on my 360 account, so.
8947920	8948920	Nice.
8948920	8950920	Through me, you have it.
8950920	8951920	Woohoo.
8951920	8954920	Alright, couple more stories for you guys, then we'll get to the Twitters.
8954920	8956280	Loki.
8956280	8964360	So there's a lot of high concept stuff that Microsoft's doing, especially since, you know,
8964360	8971040	they just, you know, had the Sesame Street Once Upon a Monster game come out on Xbox
8971040	8977560	360 for Kinect just last week, and so now they're kind of showing, you know, what they
8977560	8980480	could possibly do for, you know, new things.
8980480	8986560	So next year, they're talking already, there's going to be a game called Pixar's Rush, and
8986560	8992720	what this will allow you to do is, you know, actually go into the games as, you know, some
8992720	8994560	of your favorite Pixar characters.
8994560	8998560	They're going to have, you know, five different worlds, including The Incredibles, Ratatouille,
8998560	9002840	Up, Toy Story, and Cars.
9002840	9010360	And then, of course, going with that, they're going to also do Kinect Sesame Street TV,
9010360	9012920	which is kind of neat.
9012920	9017480	What it is, is it's going to be something that you watch actual TV shows, or like, almost
9017480	9022000	like episodes, and you can interact with them using Kinect.
9022000	9028640	So like, they showed one that showed kind of an almost live-action feed of, you know,
9028640	9029640	Grover, whatever, trying to...
9029640	9031120	Can I choke Elmo?
9031120	9033040	I don't know about that.
9033040	9037160	Trying to, like, catch stuff that you throw at him and stuff.
9037160	9043720	And then they also had another kind of, going along with this new Family Vision video that
9043720	9048960	they put out, showing a Kinect National Geographic TV.
9048960	9054680	And with that, you can know, they have, like, people going, okay, you know, who can spot,
9054680	9056480	you know, whatever.
9056480	9060500	So you're like, you know, kind of have like a punch card almost that you're, okay, I see
9060500	9061500	a moose.
9061500	9064720	And, you know, whoever shouts it out first, you know, gets a point and that kind of stuff.
9064720	9068020	Or you can ask about more information on certain things.
9068020	9069800	It's like interactive TV almost.
9069800	9071280	That's kind of neat.
9071280	9072280	If it works.
9072280	9074020	See, now that's going to be something if...
9074020	9076320	That makes the Kinect very useful, actually.
9076320	9082920	That to me seems like something that would be more useful for, like, their TV service.
9082920	9086320	Especially since I would hope that something like that would be kind of free, since PBS
9086320	9089760	is free, for the most part.
9089760	9092720	So that'd be kind of cool if they had, you know, Sesame Street and stuff.
9092720	9094840	You could download episodes.
9094840	9097200	Why can't they do this with adult shows?
9097200	9099920	Like can I vote for American Idol through my Kinect?
9099920	9102060	That'd be kind of cool.
9102060	9106480	You know, or yell, fuck this guy, and it'll, like, be a negative vote or something.
9106480	9107480	Maybe.
9107480	9111920	Going to our chat room, the chat is a little bit behind because of the live delay.
9111920	9114200	They're commenting on the Soul Calibur story a little bit here.
9114200	9118640	Hitstun wanted to throw out there that Dom Pierre debuted in Soul Calibur IV PSP.
9118640	9122320	I guess sometimes the Soul Calibur series kind of does these previews.
9122320	9126360	Hitstun says, just like Amy's moveset debuted in Soul Calibur III Arcade Edition before
9126360	9128100	showing up in Soul Calibur IV.
9128100	9130680	So sometimes you get a little sneak peek.
9130680	9133200	I did not, I didn't play the Soul Calibur PSP.
9133200	9134200	I don't know, I don't know why.
9134200	9135480	I just didn't think it would transfer very well.
9135480	9138920	It's like an action RPG, I think, right, where it's fighting matches but also a story mode.
9138920	9141680	I think it's a lot more fighting.
9141680	9144200	And I believe, if I'm not mistaken, Kratos was on that.
9144200	9147520	So yeah, funny enough, Kratos is in everything!
9147520	9152160	All right, what'll he be in next, Angry Birds?
9152160	9157840	All right, last but not least tonight before we get to the Skype line is a story about
9157840	9159080	toilet gaming.
9159080	9163000	Yes, we've heard about this before, but no seriously, it's like going on to the next
9163000	9164120	level now.
9164120	9169400	Sega Toys is making these toilets where you can actually game with pee.
9169400	9173480	There's all sorts of mini games like erasing graffiti with a hose.
9173480	9175640	You can guess what the hose is.
9175640	9178540	You can use wind to blow under a woman's skirt.
9178540	9180000	Somehow your pee is wind.
9180000	9181840	I don't know.
9181840	9185240	And do I even want to read this?
9185240	9189040	A bukkake battle where you shoot milk from your nose.
9189040	9190040	No!
9190040	9196480	Yes, in fact, you can actually see some pictures here at mycom.co.jp.
9196480	9203480	You can actually see pictures of the little urinals here with the little TV monitors in
9203480	9204480	them.
9204480	9205480	See, look at that.
9205480	9206480	See, that creeps me out though.
9206480	9208600	Doesn't that look like a little webcam at the top?
9208600	9213240	Like who knows what images are being transmitted to Sega headquarters on that thing?
9213240	9215040	Like you sick pervos.
9215040	9219760	And for this screenshot here with the little angry cloud of wind that's trying to blow
9219760	9225240	up the girl's dress so that we can see her underwear, I'm just thinking of some dude
9225240	9229560	totally dunking his ass over this thing and letting him want to rip and then sharding.
9229560	9234520	And it's like, dear Sega, your game made me shit my pants and I'm very upset that the
9234520	9237640	little fart cloud panty game made me do this.
9237640	9238640	Sorry.
9238640	9239640	Got problems.
9239640	9244720	Do you have to insert a quarter to make this work or is it just like, are we going back
9244720	9246480	to pay toilets or what's the deal?
9246480	9247840	Oh, you got to enter.
9247840	9251840	Insert something stop.
9251840	9254200	Just think of, you know, people drunk.
9254200	9255320	They can't aim.
9255320	9256360	You work in an arcade.
9256360	9258160	You're like, I, I'm not cleaning this up.
9258160	9263960	Hilarious thing to have at a bar, but let's, let's just, let's just all form a prayer circle
9263960	9268560	right now and hope that this never shows up in the U S let's just bow our heads.
9268560	9273260	All right, we're going to open up the Skype line.
9273260	9277600	It's about time one eight seven seven game O L R or our username on Skype is orange lounge
9277600	9278600	radio.
9278600	9281080	We will take your calls about anything you want to talk about tonight, whether it be
9281080	9284760	a story that we've talked about or something that maybe we didn't get to.
9284760	9287640	Maybe you want to talk about how you've had yourself barricaded in your room all week
9287640	9288640	playing Arkham city.
9288640	9290900	I'd love to hear about it cause sadly none of us did that.
9290900	9293040	So there you go.
9293040	9297320	One eight seven seven game O L R or our username on Skype is orange lounge radio.
9297320	9300960	It is a toll free number in the U S and Canada, but I can't speak for other countries.
9300960	9304560	I would suggest if you're in another country, you get Skype for free orange lounge radio,
9304560	9307160	all one word on Skype.
9307160	9312120	Meanwhile while we wait for calls, we're going to go to the Twitters, uh, dark to see a tweets
9312120	9313120	us.
9313120	9316400	If the DDR freak thing doesn't wind up happening, we should totally organize a tournament of
9316400	9319040	some sort for our 10th next year.
9319040	9320640	That's kind of what I want to do anyway.
9320640	9325560	In fact, I've, I've kind of put dark soccer in charge of putting the 10th thing together,
9325560	9332120	um, because she knows people that do stuff at places that we want to be involved with.
9332120	9335440	And I can't say much more than that, but we are trying to make the 10th a big deal, but
9335440	9340400	I want to warn you guys, it may not be on the exact anniversary of the show, but we're
9340400	9342020	trying to get close.
9342020	9346280	So for those that are trying to be prepared, shut up.
9346280	9348200	We can celebrate a little early if we want.
9348200	9351240	In the meantime, we're going to go to the calls and Skypline, all that stuff higher
9351240	9352240	on orange launch radio.
9352240	9353240	Who's this?
9353240	9354240	It's death wishings.
9354240	9355480	Hey, haven't heard from you in a while.
9355480	9356480	What's up?
9356480	9357480	Nothing much.
9357480	9360760	I'm surprised you didn't make it to Dave gruel con.
9360760	9364320	I'm not going to pay 130 bucks to play demos of betas.
9364320	9366040	I'm going to sell my soul to blizzard.
9366040	9368320	You can see all those cool pandas.
9368320	9372280	I can see all that cool shit on DirecTV and I've got this thing called the internet is
9372280	9375960	panda continent, panda class, panda games, and Pokemon.
9375960	9384680	So actually I want to talk to Loki about, uh, grant the photo mods.
9384680	9385680	All right.
9385680	9386680	That'll cost a dollar.
9386680	9387680	Interesting.
9387680	9388680	Mod is, have you heard?
9388680	9389680	Look, have you heard of that ice?
9389680	9392240	It's, I think it's like icy enhancer.
9392240	9393240	Yeah.
9393240	9396400	And it's, uh, the, uh, Ian, it's EMB stuff.
9396400	9399880	It like, it does like a crazy texture, like mods and all that.
9399880	9403000	It makes the game look just like ungodly beautiful.
9403000	9404000	Yeah.
9404000	9407800	A lot of, a lot of the EMB stuff, uh, looks pretty good.
9407800	9408960	And I mean, do you use it?
9408960	9409960	Like, can you run it?
9409960	9413780	Cause my, my, me, my friend, we're trying to, we're worried that he wants to install it,
9413780	9416040	but he's afraid that he can't run it.
9416040	9417840	And I'm, cause he doesn't have a core i7.
9417840	9422000	He, I think he only has like a i3.
9422000	9428480	I haven't tried to run it and really don't feel like trying to run it either because
9428480	9430680	you can break your toaster.
9430680	9435820	Well, because you know, on my laptop, um, you know, it runs all right.
9435820	9441640	I have everything turned up pretty high, but, um, I just don't really care for it to look
9441640	9446720	any better than it already does cause really I just use this laptop for working on map
9446720	9448080	mods and stuff like that.
9448080	9454400	And, you know, just trying to put stuff together that way.
9454400	9458520	You know, I, I was working on something today and the frame rate's crawling because I have
9458520	9462600	so many objects spawning, I have to work on, you know, trimming stuff down.
9462600	9466960	So yeah, I don't really need any more graphical enhancements added onto it.
9466960	9467960	Hmm.
9467960	9469480	Oh, anyways, back to Sky.
9469480	9473360	So what, honestly, since you played WoW, I believe you played a lot of WoW, right?
9473360	9475760	I have played a lot of WoW, yes.
9475760	9478800	What is, honestly, what is your whole opinion on this expansion?
9478800	9482260	Um, I, I'm whatever about the panda thing.
9482260	9487400	I think it's a little silly that they're bi-factional, but you know, I, I think it'll be good in
9487400	9488400	the long run.
9488400	9489600	I love the art style.
9489600	9494080	Like even though I'm meh on the pandas, I would have been like 100% totally okay with
9494080	9496720	this at the panda, panda, and been NPCs.
9496720	9498560	Like I kind of think they should have stayed.
9498560	9500960	I would have rather seen the Tuskar be playable.
9500960	9508440	Well, of course I just want a Tuskar named Diabetus, but the Tuskar or the Tonka, what
9508440	9510720	are those, what are the Torrin like people called?
9510720	9511720	The Bison.
9511720	9512720	They're Tonka.
9512720	9513720	Yeah.
9513720	9514720	They could have been a great playable class.
9514720	9517400	The Naga, everybody thinks is inevitable at some point.
9517400	9519800	It just seems like there's a lot of other stuff they could have chose from, but fine.
9519800	9520800	They went cute.
9520800	9525400	I mean, I understand, I guess pandas allegedly are a part of a lore, my friend said, but
9525400	9530840	they're always joke lore, but it's like, honestly, I mean, every update I've seen,
9530840	9532640	you know, and wow, like that, it's so funny.
9532640	9536840	The ones that have added like big segments were, this is part of the segment and then
9536840	9537840	there's all this shit to do.
9537840	9541520	And then it was like cataclysm, oh, it changes map, but there's all this shit to do.
9541520	9545640	And then this one's just like fucking pandas everywhere.
9545640	9546640	Look at us.
9546640	9547640	We're so cool.
9547640	9548640	Weaboo now.
9548640	9550200	Well, look, here's the thing though.
9550200	9553520	At the end of the day, like I probably will not be rolling a panda monk.
9553520	9556640	I will have to roll a gnome monk, cause that's going to be awesome.
9556640	9557640	Cause gnomes are hilarious.
9557640	9558640	Oh, you can be a gnome monk?
9558640	9560080	I thought it was only pandas could be monks.
9560080	9564600	No, anybody can be not monks, except funny enough, Worgen and Goblin, who were the additions
9564600	9566320	in the last expansion.
9566320	9569920	Every other race in the game can be, I'm just waiting to see a bunch of pandas with a variation
9569920	9571040	of the name, Jack Black.
9571040	9572040	Yeah, I know.
9572040	9573040	Right.
9573040	9574040	Reserve the names.
9574040	9577960	Now, Slace's Pop told a funny joke on Horde House about, what was it you said about female
9577960	9578960	pandarins?
9578960	9584080	Their slash dance emote is they're just going to sit in a chair and move their hand around
9584080	9586640	like Adele and rolling in the deep.
9586640	9587720	They're just going to sit in a chair.
9587720	9591640	I was trying to get, I was trying to get a panda named Adele, but the name was already
9591640	9592640	taken.
9592640	9593640	Like somebody beat us to it.
9593640	9596520	So, uh, but, uh, here's the thing, Death Wishing.
9596520	9600000	And I kind of said this at the top of the show, but I'm more excited about the fact
9600000	9605040	that they're giving players at level 90, so much more to do than just dungeon rating and
9605040	9607440	PVP, which is already a lot as it is, but now,
9607440	9609040	They're giving us Pokemon.
9609040	9610040	Pokemon.
9610040	9611040	Believe it or not.
9611040	9612040	It's a thing.
9612040	9613040	People will be into it.
9613040	9614040	Uh, challenge dungeons.
9614040	9615040	Sounds like I'm really excited.
9615040	9618640	I think they're just scared because of the older public.
9618640	9619640	Of course they are.
9619640	9620640	Of course they are.
9620640	9621640	They're just business.
9621640	9623640	I stopped playing Eve Online just because of that.
9623640	9625200	I'm going to be playing that.
9625200	9629000	Here's the thing, you know, and I have no doubt that the game will be good.
9629000	9631120	However, we have gone through this.
9631120	9632480	How many times?
9632480	9634560	Age of Conan was going to be the killer.
9634560	9636640	Then EverQuest II and then War Hammer.
9636640	9639240	You don't understand man, it's Star Wars.
9639240	9640240	I know.
9640240	9641240	I know.
9641240	9644160	It's going to be all the people, I'm telling you, all the people from Star Wars Galaxies
9644160	9648440	will play it because of the remorse of Star Wars Galaxies shutting down.
9648440	9651600	They may not like it, but they'll just cry themselves while playing it.
9651600	9655120	I miss you.
9655120	9656120	That's all I can say.
9656120	9660200	I, I, I, obviously Blizzard is going to lose some people to Star Wars.
9660200	9663440	That's why they've come up with this whole annual pass thing to lock you in anyway.
9663440	9665000	I mean that's no, no.
9665000	9669440	I mean, I heard that buying a year pass now you can get Diablo 3 for free, that's from
9669440	9671480	what I heard.
9671480	9676560	And that's just kind of solidifying that they, Activision Blizzard has too much money.
9676560	9678880	Well we'll give you the game that we know we're going to make shitloads of money on
9678880	9679880	for free.
9679880	9680880	Not really.
9680880	9681880	Because we have too much money.
9681880	9685200	I know, they're going to make money on Diablo anyway, and like I said earlier, if you're
9685200	9689800	contracted for a year of wow, you pretty much are guaranteed to get Mists of Pandaria, which
9689800	9692800	they're not giving you for free, so.
9692800	9693800	Mists of Pandaria.
9693800	9694800	Yep.
9694800	9700760	Alright, any other BlizzCon or what have you thoughts before we let you go, buddy?
9700760	9703360	Did anything cool happen with the whole Foo Fighters thing?
9703360	9705040	Any reports on that, or was it just Foo Fighters?
9705040	9707720	Dave Roll played the guitar in the audience, that's what I heard.
9707720	9709120	So like, you might have got to touch him.
9709120	9710760	Oh okay, so I already seen that live.
9710760	9711760	Oh okay, cool.
9711760	9712760	Alright, cool story bro.
9712760	9713760	Alright.
9713760	9714760	Alright.
9714760	9715760	Take care, buddy.
9715760	9716760	Later.
9716760	9717760	Bye.
9717760	9723400	I still want the WoW expansion, Mists of Panera Bread, so I can play a, get a turkey feta
9723400	9725360	panini with side salad.
9725360	9727920	Kaijuto in chat says, back off Adele, she's hot.
9727920	9732160	Hey, I never said she wasn't hot, like you know, everybody's into whatever, but I'm just,
9732160	9736480	I'm sorry, it's just, the joke was too good, you had to, I had to be there.
9736480	9739000	Alright, let's see, moving on with some more tweets.
9739000	9742600	MNZeba tweets us saying, Loki, is this what you do when you play Grand Theft Auto?
9742600	9746240	Usually I don't click on YouTubes that I don't know what they are, but I'm going to take
9746240	9747240	a chance on this one.
9747240	9748240	Let's see.
9748240	9751240	No, but I feel like that's pretty funny.
9751240	9753960	It's like, what, throwing cars at people?
9753960	9759800	No, it's not throwing cars, the cars just never exist, so they fly around.
9759800	9760800	That's funny.
9760800	9764040	It looks like Nightmeto's just throwing cars around.
9764040	9771080	It is very hard to play that, I once contemplated doing that as part of the mod, but I was quickly
9771080	9773800	vetoed on that, because, so like, uh, yeah.
9773800	9777920	So you're trying to do the campaign stuff, or is this for Deathmatch, or are you trying
9777920	9778920	to run around?
9778920	9781400	I gotta take this call, it's a very appropriate time.
9781400	9783400	Hi, you're on Warner Brothers Radio, who's this?
9783400	9784400	Hi, this is Zeba.
9784400	9788640	Zeba, we're watching this video, I am cracking the hell up at this Grand Theft Auto stuff,
9788640	9789640	this is great.
9789640	9794200	Yeah, I found that on my Twitter, I was like, oh god, I just thought of Loki just right
9794200	9795200	when I watched it.
9795200	9798840	And I love that they used the Benny Hill theme, A+, thumbs up.
9798840	9799840	Thanks.
9799840	9802120	So what's on your mind tonight, Zeba?
9802120	9804360	I just want to let you know, you jinxed my iPhone.
9804360	9807680	Oh shit, what did I do?
9807680	9813640	A couple days later, that you announced that your iPhone's power button went, um, mine
9813640	9814640	went.
9814640	9818120	Oh no, I'm sorry, is it the sleep button, or is it the...
9818120	9821880	Yes, the sleep button, the sleep power button, whatever you want to call it, on the top.
9821880	9828400	They're faulty, I want a refund, I'm suing Apple, I'm suing Steve Jobs, wait, can't do
9828400	9832200	that, I'm suing Tim Cook, I'm suing everybody.
9832200	9839040	Well, thank god that my iPhone is not a year old yet, so I still had warranty, so they
9839040	9841120	were able to give me a whole new phone.
9841120	9842120	Nice!
9842120	9843120	You know what's funny?
9843120	9847120	My very first iPhone 4, the little ringer button, the little thing on the side next
9847120	9851520	to the volume that turns the ringer on and off, that was broken.
9851520	9855840	But that was like day one, a break, so they gave me a new phone for free, but it was still,
9855840	9858280	I had to re-sync everything, blah blah blah blah.
9858280	9861940	I'm gonna get a new phone, but probably in January, and I've got to decide between now
9861940	9866320	and then if I'm just gonna say, you know what, forget the iPhone, I'm done with it, and go
9866320	9871600	to the iPad, or if I'm gonna get suckered in and buy the iPhone 4S anyway, of which
9871600	9876440	everybody's just raving about Siri, oh, I love Siri, I love Siri, so.
9876440	9880360	How are you liking your iPhone, though, otherwise, do you do any gaming on it?
9880360	9889440	I have some games, I have like Secret of Mana, and Final Fantasy Tactics, and Katamari Damacy,
9889440	9891480	and you know, Infinity Blade.
9891480	9894360	Do you think, is it just me, or do a lot of them play like poop?
9894360	9898760	Yeah, especially Secret of Mana is really hard to move around.
9898760	9899760	Yeah, it's unfortunate.
9899760	9903600	They made it a little better, but it still is pretty hard.
9903600	9909920	I will say, though, the Final Fantasy 3 remake, it's probably still like 15 bucks, which is
9909920	9916080	like 15 times as much, what most games cost, but it's actually done really well, and it's
9916080	9921940	easy to control, so I gotta say, the Final Fantasy 3 remake from the DS is really good
9921940	9928320	on iPhone, or iPad, whatever it is, you're gonna game on out there in the audience, so.
9928320	9932960	I did have the DS version, so I'm not really into, you know, getting it on my phone.
9932960	9935160	Yeah, you don't need to buy the same thing twice, that's true.
9935160	9936160	No.
9936160	9938920	So what else have you been playing, any console or PC games?
9938920	9945880	I did get a new DS game, I can't really pronounce the name, it's like Sola do Robo, the Red
9945880	9946880	Hunter.
9946880	9947880	Okay.
9947880	9950000	What's this game about?
9950000	9954360	All the furries are getting it, but that's not why I got it.
9954360	9959200	But it's, I just kind of just started playing it, so I really don't know too much about
9959200	9966120	the story, but you are this fox, and you're just trying to save the world, but I really
9966120	9970160	don't know too much about the story, like I said, I have to keep going at it, but I
9970160	9971160	like it so far.
9971160	9972160	Nice.
9972160	9975200	And why are the furries into it?
9975200	9981440	Because it's all, you know, anthropomorphic characters in it.
9981440	9982440	That sounds like fun.
9982440	9986320	Slice just popped, did I see your eyes just perk up a little bit?
9986320	9987320	Yes.
9987320	9990600	Oh god, please don't go there.
9990600	9991600	Alright.
9991600	9996220	Ziba, I hope you enjoy the game, and enjoy your phone now that it works again, and I'm
9996220	9997920	sorry to curse you, but I'm really happy.
9997920	9999240	I'm really just joking.
9999240	10003080	I know, I know, but I'm glad you at least got a replacement for free.
10003080	10005960	To be fair, I still need to take mine to the store and see if there's anything they can
10005960	10009360	do with it, but I just, I don't have my hopes up because I didn't buy AppleCare, so.
10009360	10012840	Alright, well Ziba, I'm going to let you go, okay?
10012840	10013840	Okay, thank you.
10013840	10015800	Alright, take care, thanks for calling in, and thanks again for the video.
10015800	10016800	No problem.
10016800	10017800	Later.
10017800	10021400	1877 Game OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
10021400	10025640	Going to some other tweets, Zither77 tweets us saying, you guys may want to see this,
10025640	10029880	it's probably going to be the pinball video game to end all pinball video games, and gives
10029880	10036440	this cheap plug for pinball arcade, which I guess is for the phones and so forth.
10036440	10039120	Is this like something you're working on or something?
10039120	10040120	I don't know.
10040120	10044920	Oh shit, it has Arabian Nights, I'm there.
10044920	10046920	Fucking love the Arabian Nights table.
10046920	10048760	Isn't this just...
10048760	10055800	Oh, it looks like they have an arrangement with various pinball table folks.
10055800	10059040	There's Black Hole, because it's got Ballystern.
10059040	10064440	Oh my god, Theater of Magic, I'm so in, this is like the best table ever.
10064440	10067440	You remember this, did you ever play that?
10067440	10068440	Yeah.
10068440	10074600	Alright, I don't know if you work for the developer or what, but good job, I'm sold.
10074600	10079440	Let's see, Ericcarr18 on Twitter tweets us saying, hey guys, what if someone made a Red
10079440	10081960	Dead Redemption-esque game for the Kinect?
10081960	10084420	I think that might be cool.
10084420	10086200	Would you play Red Dead Redemption on Kinect?
10086200	10087200	No.
10087200	10090960	I think Red Dead Redemption on Kinect would not be as good as just Red Dead Redemption.
10090960	10096200	Like, I don't know, I don't think people should feel forced to pigeonhole an existing game
10096200	10097200	into the Kinect.
10097200	10099280	Like, that Fable game really has me worried.
10099280	10103320	What are you talking about, it has you worried?
10103320	10106480	It's gonna suck, like all the other ones have sucked.
10106480	10107600	I know.
10107600	10110520	Because Peter Molyneux is full of crap.
10110520	10111960	But he's new and cutting edge.
10111960	10114160	No, he's not new and cutting edge, he's stupid.
10114160	10115160	Hey, ah!
10115160	10116160	What's up in here?
10116160	10117160	Hey, Zaku.
10117160	10118160	Welcome to the show.
10118160	10119160	What's on your mind, buddy?
10119160	10124760	Oh, nothing much, just trying to like absorb all the gaming news that's, you know, or lack
10124760	10125760	thereof maybe.
10125760	10127560	It was just happening this weekend.
10127560	10130040	Well, if you're not into Blizzard, it has been kind of a dry week.
10130040	10137400	You know, Blizzcon happened, and you know, aside from like, Starcraft, the new expansion
10137400	10143680	pack, not really like phased in, but I am hyped for Battlefield 3, which is like this
10143680	10146400	Tuesday, even though I don't have my new computer ready.
10146400	10148440	Oh, I didn't realize it was that soon.
10148440	10149440	It's this Tuesday, huh?
10149440	10150440	Yeah.
10150440	10151440	Now, you've been talking, you've talked.
10151440	10154520	I just, like, because of work and everything, I didn't have the time to like start speccing
10154520	10157800	on a new computer, so I'm gonna have to play catch up.
10157800	10161840	You've called in to talk about this game before, are you excited about this?
10161840	10162840	Are you buying it?
10162840	10168200	Yes, I mean, I've seen footage of the beta so far, and it's like, it's a lot better than,
10168200	10171520	it's pretty much a lot better than Bad Company 2 at the very least.
10171520	10178440	More importantly, it does step it up as being the most realistic first person shooter this
10178440	10179440	year.
10179440	10181560	Did you decide to go PC, Xbox?
10181560	10182560	PC.
10182560	10183560	Okay.
10183560	10187000	Why do you think I just said that I'm trying to specc out a new PC for you?
10187000	10188000	Oh, derp.
10188000	10189000	Okay.
10189000	10190000	So I don't listen very well, my bad.
10190000	10195920	But it's just like, I mean, I've already made my decision between that and Modern Warfare
10195920	10196920	3.
10196920	10201280	I mean, at this point, it's like, even with Modern Warfare 3, even the fact they have
10201280	10204000	dedicated servers, they're only for unranked.
10204000	10208300	So it's like, if I wanted to level up in that game, I would have to put up with the peer
10208300	10211000	to peer crap, which is like not good on the PC.
10211000	10212000	It's a horrible experience.
10212000	10213760	It's only meant for consoles.
10213760	10219840	I think the way I see it is like Activision giving us like half, it's like going halfway
10219840	10224840	instead of actually like, you know, doing what they did before, like with the first
10224840	10225920	Modern Warfare.
10225920	10231960	What about if you can set up these controlled, super easy environments where somebody could
10231960	10235920	just have a server that's for nothing but ranking up quickly and it would kind of ruin
10235920	10236920	things?
10236920	10237920	Like I can kind of see that side of it.
10237920	10238920	Well, that's the thing.
10238920	10249040	I mean, I played Modern Warfare on PC with the servers and I was able to rank up easily.
10249040	10253640	Then again, I have like skill with the keyboard and mouse, but the point is that it didn't
10253640	10256040	really impact cheating as much.
10256040	10262160	Because either way, once they spotted you as a cheater, you automatically get kicked
10262160	10264000	and banned from that server.
10264000	10266600	You know, Punkbuster works pretty well.
10266600	10267600	It's a pretty good hammer.
10267600	10270880	Yeah, but it's leveling up quickly cheating?
10270880	10276080	Well, cheating in the sense of like when they find people hacking or cheating in that particular
10276080	10279880	server, you know, the admins boot them really fast.
10279880	10287680	But I could see why Activision is trying to like release their half-baked solution for
10287680	10292720	the lack of any servers in Modern Warfare 2.
10292720	10297340	They still want to push Elite, that whole Elite thing.
10297340	10304400	And the fact that I guess having a dedicated server ranked, they believe that they will
10304400	10307040	probably game the system that way.
10307040	10311480	You know, you have folks that find exploits that aren't really patched or more importantly
10311480	10315760	you set up a server just for like the sake of ranking really fast.
10315760	10320680	I know Team Fortress 2 had this issue back in the day where it's just like people just
10320680	10325760	idling in order to get like unlocks.
10325760	10327640	But yeah, I could see why they did that.
10327640	10333180	I mean, Battlefield 3 has dedicated servers, but it's like, I know they're, it's almost
10333180	10339280	like Bad Company 2 where everything's going to be like from their third-party providers.
10339280	10341520	But it's still a good solution though.
10341520	10348320	Well, I mean, at the end of the day, you're going to buy both games no matter what, right?
10348320	10350380	I'm probably going to just stick with Battlefield 3.
10350380	10351880	I've already made my decision.
10351880	10356240	I'm not going to touch Modern Warfare 3 unless I can pick it up for dirt cheap.
10356240	10360240	Otherwise I'm just going to stick with Battlefield 3.
10360240	10364240	I know it's not on Steam and I'm going to, you know, I'm going to have to bite the bullet
10364240	10365720	and give Origin a shot.
10365720	10369240	Well, props to you sticking by your guns and voting with your dollars.
10369240	10370240	You know, that's what we always say.
10370240	10371240	Exactly.
10371240	10372240	If you feel strongly enough, vote with your dollars.
10372240	10373240	All right, Zach.
10373240	10376680	We're going to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but have fun and hopefully see you
10376680	10377680	in next week's show.
10377680	10378680	You're not too busy playing Battlefield.
10378680	10379680	Well, that's the thing.
10379680	10384320	If I can get a computer in like a week, which I doubt, it's going to take a few more weeks
10384320	10385920	for me to spec out everything.
10385920	10389600	All right, then we know when you disappear what happened.
10389600	10390600	Exactly.
10390600	10391600	All right.
10391600	10392600	Take care, buddy.
10392600	10393600	All right.
10393600	10394600	Bye.
10394600	10395600	All right.
10395600	10396600	That's going to do it for Skype calls tonight.
10396600	10400240	For those who didn't get through, sorry, but try writing us an email, Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
10400240	10403600	I want to quickly wrap up the rest of these tweets, though, real quick.
10403600	10406360	Osfer tweets us saying a couple things.
10406360	10409000	First, I'm watching people play the new Spyro.
10409000	10411760	It doesn't look nearly as bad as Loki describes.
10411760	10415260	Loki, it's just you're too harsh on him.
10415260	10421400	It's all about, not necessarily the gameplay, but the message behind it.
10421400	10423160	It sets precedent.
10423160	10426880	And Osfer also asks, random question for the staff.
10426880	10428560	Who is your favorite Pokemon?
10428560	10430720	Mine is Mewtwo.
10430720	10431720	I have an answer for this.
10431720	10434320	Does anyone else on staff have a way to answer for this?
10434320	10435320	SalaciousPop?
10435320	10437440	You watch or play Pokemon?
10437440	10438440	Bidoof.
10438440	10439440	What's Bidoof?
10439440	10442120	I've never heard of Bidoof, or did you make that up?
10442120	10447520	No, I need to Google it, but he's the little squirrel that's stupid, and he's like the
10447520	10449560	worst Pokemon ever.
10449560	10453640	My favorite Pokemon by far is Jigglypuff, the one that gets really pissed off when she
10453640	10457160	sings and puts everyone to sleep, that she draws on their face with a marker.
10457160	10459120	Those are always my favorite episodes of the old show.
10459120	10460760	Loki, do you have a favorite Pokemon?
10460760	10465280	I don't know any of the Pokemon.
10465280	10467400	One of these days, I want to convince Loki to a bet.
10467400	10469940	I mean, obviously, we're never going to get him to dress up as the Tingle outfit, but
10469940	10472000	we have to think of other things that would be awesome.
10472000	10476600	And I think one of them would be that Loki would have to sing the Pokemon rap on air.
10476600	10481040	Aww, that's a cute little derpy mon.
10481040	10482040	I like that.
10482040	10483040	Is that the one you...
10483040	10484040	That's Bidoof.
10484040	10485600	Bidoof?
10485600	10487400	On YouTube, everyone should Google.
10487400	10491860	It was UPN's Cartoon Afternoons.
10491860	10496760	It was one of the bumpers they made between Batman, the animated series, and Pokemon.
10496760	10500400	And it's Batman Sings Jigglypuff, and if you find it, you should just pull it up right
10500400	10501400	now.
10501400	10502400	It's super awesome.
10502400	10505080	It's a bumper that UPN made.
10505080	10507760	Could it be this right here?
10507760	10510680	Jigglypuff, a balloon Pokemon.
10510680	10512120	Time for bed.
10512120	10514440	All right, but a deal's a deal.
10514440	10515440	No way.
10515440	10516440	You promised.
10516440	10517440	Jigglypuff, Jigglypuff.
10517440	10518920	All right, good night.
10518920	10520920	The whole thing.
10520920	10532000	Jigglypuff, Jigglypuff, Jigglypuff.
10532000	10536200	Pokemon, next on Kids WB.
10536200	10539280	WB, not UPN, my bad.
10539280	10542200	Ah, same thing now, it doesn't matter.
10542200	10543200	Good times.
10543200	10545200	I love Jigglypuff.
10545200	10548520	Some tweets from Tigerclaw305, since it's a couple tweets.
10548520	10551360	I thought you hit on this one earlier in the show, Loki.
10551360	10555160	Was it the Portal 2 DLC that will have an in-game map editor with it?
10555160	10556160	Yeah.
10556160	10557280	I thought you'd mention something about that.
10557280	10560880	Well, it does come with an in-game map editor as well, if you didn't already know.
10560880	10563200	And that's cool.
10563200	10567320	Because some of the best levels are gonna come from the users that make their own crazy
10567320	10568320	shit.
10568320	10571840	So I'm always happy to see level editors come to games.
10571840	10576240	It seems like it's a little late, but I guess if it extends the life of the game, then yay,
10576240	10577240	right?
10577240	10578240	Yeah.
10578240	10584640	This is another tweet about Mass Effect 3's demo will be out early for Battlefield 3 buyers
10584640	10587280	if you get it new.
10587280	10590920	Yet another spin on the Project $10, but at least this one isn't as bad.
10590920	10595480	I mean, an early demo, that's more of a reasonable kind of perk, right?
10595480	10600460	So there's gonna be a demo for Mass Effect 3 in January, and it was announced by BioWare.
10600460	10602920	More information will be on BioWare's forums.
10602920	10608680	But if you redeem the online pass for Battlefield 3, it will be available earlier to you.
10608680	10611320	Mass Effect 3, by the way, is supposed to have multiplayer support.
10611320	10613280	That was confirmed earlier this month.
10613280	10617000	And it's gonna have an online co-op mode that can affect the single-player game.
10617000	10618000	Interesting.
10618000	10623560	So yep, if you activate a Battlefield 3 online pass on any of the platforms, I guess the
10623560	10629080	EA account, your account will just be enabled with this access to get the demo.
10629080	10632840	So that's kinda cool on whatever system the code was redeemed on.
10632840	10633840	So...
10633840	10636200	Or actually, no, I take that back.
10636200	10638660	It doesn't have to be for the account that you bought it on.
10638660	10643560	It says that the access is applied to the EA account, so meaning if you buy Battlefield
10643560	10647200	3 on the PC, you can get the demo on the PlayStation 3, or whatever you wanna do.
10647200	10650200	So it's kind of tradeable amongst those.
10650200	10651960	That's kinda neat.
10651960	10655040	There will be other ways for the rest of us to get in there if you're not buying Battlefield
10655040	10658680	3, so don't cry.
10658680	10663920	Lastly but not leastly, a couple of tweets from Ramaditya Knight sends us some tweets.
10663920	10664920	Hey, OLR!
10664920	10670000	The Sonic 1 and 2 soundtrack to celebrate his 20th birthday has been released this month,
10670000	10671560	so if you're a Sonic fan, you should go get it.
10671560	10674720	I seem to remember a story on that coming up before, like when it was first announced,
10674720	10676600	but it's good to know that it's out.
10676600	10682320	And you might remember that name, Ramaditya Knight does a lot of these tin whistle or
10682320	10683680	the recorder.
10683680	10687640	He does a lot of these songs, and he sent us a new YouTube at his account, which is
10687640	10696440	Ramaditya Skywalker, and he's actually playing the Green Hill Zone theme.
10696440	10703440	Obviously he's using the background, but that might not be the best part, where he's playing
10703440	10706440	the same three notes over and over.
10706440	10709600	That's a little better.
10709600	10711440	Still irritating.
10711440	10716520	Hey, hey, hey, I don't see you playing a musical instrument, I don't think you should be making
10716520	10717520	fun.
10717520	10719120	I don't think you should be making fun.
10719120	10722520	I think you're talented, don't listen to Loki.
10722520	10724880	I played the clarinet when I was younger.
10724880	10725880	You sure did.
10725880	10727280	I sure did.
10727280	10730520	I probably couldn't play that on the clarinet anymore, I could probably play the squeak
10730520	10733280	song, that's probably about all I could play on the clarinet these days.
10733280	10734280	Band geek.
10734280	10737360	Shut up, what's wrong with being a band geek?
10737360	10741000	I tried to be a band geek, but I was too weak to carry my instrument and I was picked on.
10741000	10743520	That's because you tried to play the fucking tuba, and you were-
10743520	10744520	No, trombone.
10744520	10745520	Oh, my bad.
10745520	10747600	You were like this, weren't you like a really scrawny kid?
10747600	10748600	Oh, yeah.
10748600	10751600	And now you're like six foot four, like you just-
10751600	10756640	I'm still weak as hell, but I'm six foot four-ish, so there's at least a lot of me, yeah.
10756640	10763040	All right, and the chat room is asking for a link of Ramaditya Knight's performance there,
10763040	10768400	and stupid me forgot to link that, so let me do that right now for the chatters in the
10768400	10773960	chat room at chat.orangelaungeradio.com, there you go.
10773960	10779240	There it is, and Rama says in chat room, chat.orangelaungeradio.com, and now Skye plays the skin flute.
10779240	10781360	Yeah, screw you.
10781360	10783840	All right.
10783840	10785200	That's it, we're done.
10785200	10786960	We're wrapping up another episode of Orange Lawns Radio.
10786960	10790400	I gotta ask first if there's any last minute stories, Loki?
10790400	10792600	Yeah, there's just one.
10792600	10801840	It was basically, they announced that in Sonic Generations, you can unlock the original Sonic
10801840	10804080	the Hedgehog game.
10804080	10805080	Again?
10805080	10806720	Yeah, that's totally new news.
10806720	10809440	How many times did they release the first Sonic game for real?
10809440	10814040	Absolutely, brand new news, unless you listened to our show back in August, in which I actually
10814040	10815680	revealed that same thing.
10815680	10818640	So yeah, totally new.
10818640	10824920	Well, if you somehow missed out on your nine other opportunities to re-buy Sonic the Hedgehog,
10824920	10826960	the original, here you go.
10826960	10831080	Sonic Generations is a bet, and they have a couple dev ones now if you wanna check them
10831080	10832080	out.
10832080	10833080	All right.
10833080	10835360	Well, that's gonna wrap up another episode of Orange Lawns Radio.
10835360	10838080	We're gonna go around first and get everybody's final thought.
10838080	10842160	And my final thought tonight is skinny fries.
10842160	10843160	I am full of them.
10843160	10844160	We ate that whole bag.
10844160	10845160	I know, we're fat.
10845160	10846160	Actually, you know what though?
10846160	10847800	In that entire bag, there's only six grams of fat.
10847800	10848800	That's not that bad.
10848800	10850800	There's more grams of fat in a muffin.
10850800	10851800	All right.
10851800	10853000	So let's just pop.
10853000	10854000	What's your final thought tonight?
10854000	10856880	Thank you for being here, by the way, and filling in.
10856880	10857880	Always appreciate it.
10857880	10858880	You're welcome.
10858880	10859880	Always a pleasure.
10859880	10860880	Thank you.
10860880	10861880	Thank you for the food.
10861880	10862880	Because I'm hungry.
10862880	10865440	Are you getting a headache again?
10865440	10866440	Kind of.
10866440	10867440	My stomach's been kickin'.
10867440	10868440	Poor thing.
10868440	10870000	And low-key, last but not least, your final thought tonight.
10870000	10872120	Crackers need to get crackin'.
10872120	10874000	All right.
10874000	10876200	That's gonna do it for another episode of Orange Lawns Radio.
10876200	10881040	If you liked our show, you know all we ask you guys, tell a friend or two about the show.
10881040	10885040	We don't have advertising, big dollars, you know, we're not a huge operation.
10885040	10887280	Word of mouth is really what keeps our show alive.
10887280	10889080	Leave us a nice review on iTunes if you could.
10889080	10890760	We haven't gotten any of those in a long time.
10890760	10892320	It's been about a month or two.
10892320	10894560	So we really appreciate those.
10894560	10899020	Listen to Hoard House, if you like World of Warcraft or Blizzard stuff, HoardHouse.com.
10899020	10903160	And of course, this is the last time we can ask you to do this, so please, please write
10903160	10904260	yourself a reminder.
10904260	10908800	Ask Siri to remind you every day, vote in the podcast awards for Orange Lawns Radio.
10908800	10910400	Best gaming podcast.
10910400	10914280	Really appreciate a vote for our friends over at the Geek Spin and Pod Safe Music as well.
10914280	10915280	You know, help us win.
10915280	10916580	That'll go a long way in promoting.
10916580	10919000	We really, really appreciate every single vote.
10919000	10922200	Even if we don't win, we have really felt a lot of love from the community, which has
10922200	10923200	been great.
10923200	10926980	Like, you know, I've seen like other podcasters like retweeting and like supporting us, especially
10926980	10927980	the All Games family.
10927980	10932320	So I really, before we sign off tonight, want to give a heartfelt thank you to all the All
10932320	10936520	Games people who have really rallied behind us and in helping us to win.
10936520	10944600	And if, if, if, if, if we do win, it will be in large part thanks to that and all of
10944600	10945600	their efforts.
10945600	10948320	So really, really, really appreciate it.
10948320	10950560	So I guess that's going to do it.
10950560	10951560	We'll be back next week.
10951560	10953080	Dark Sakura will be back from Disneyland.
10953080	10956740	I'm sure to tell us all about her adventures on Space Mountain, maybe at Electronica or
10956740	10958200	whatever else she's been doing there.
10958200	10964800	And we'll talk about whatever else comes up in gaming with our bit of wit and sassy commentary.
10964800	10967740	Until then, be safe.
10967740	10968740	Don't be a dick.
10968740	10969740	We'll see you next week.
