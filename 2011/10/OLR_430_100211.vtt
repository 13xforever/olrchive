00:00.000 --> 00:20.720
More lies, more lies, more lies, this will be edited out later.

00:20.720 --> 00:21.720
Lies.

00:21.720 --> 00:36.940
And the last of the game is a new section to the PSN Terms of Service.

00:36.940 --> 00:37.940
Orange Lounge Radio.

00:37.940 --> 00:38.940
Hello, welcome to episode 430 of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:38.940 --> 00:41.320
We are awesome.

00:41.320 --> 00:42.520
And Rob's not here.

00:42.520 --> 00:48.980
No, actually we are the show that tells gamers what they really want to know.

00:48.980 --> 00:50.280
And I am your host for tonight.

00:50.280 --> 00:53.320
I am DarkSakura and with us is Loki.

00:53.320 --> 00:54.520
Hi.

00:54.520 --> 01:01.920
And our special guest tonight is some dude that I picked up on the internet, Dan.

01:01.920 --> 01:02.920
I'm a hobo.

01:02.920 --> 01:03.920
Yeah.

01:03.920 --> 01:11.480
Um, so again, it's a Sunday night, six o'clock Pacific time, and you can join us on allgames.com

01:11.480 --> 01:15.960
and listen to us live and hang out in our chat room at allgames.com.

01:15.960 --> 01:16.960
Why am I not allgames.com?

01:16.960 --> 01:21.360
That's Bobby's chat room at Orange Lounge and pound Orange Lounge.

01:21.360 --> 01:25.300
And you can also, uh, follow the chat at orangeloungeradio.com.

01:25.300 --> 01:29.880
So yeah, it's another derpisode because Rob's not here and I'm kind of ill prepared.

01:29.880 --> 01:35.240
So why don't we just go ahead and skip the formalities and go to how was our gaming week.

01:35.240 --> 01:38.040
And mine, uh, I played WoW for 20 minutes a day every day.

01:38.040 --> 01:39.040
That's it.

01:39.040 --> 01:40.040
Loki?

01:40.040 --> 01:41.040
Just 20 minutes?

01:41.040 --> 01:42.040
Pretty much.

01:42.040 --> 01:44.600
Except for the other night when I was doing, uh, the pet hunt.

01:44.600 --> 01:47.520
How do you even play WoW for 20 minutes?

01:47.520 --> 01:50.400
Uh, just go on to do dailies.

01:50.400 --> 01:51.400
Wow.

01:51.400 --> 01:57.840
Anyways, um, I played, uh, quite a few things actually this week besides the usual stuff.

01:57.840 --> 02:01.920
More Grand Theft Auto, more Earth Defense Force, Insect Armageddon.

02:01.920 --> 02:09.040
Um, I did play a few things, including some stuff I should be playing, like, um, Tiny

02:09.040 --> 02:10.040
Tower.

02:10.040 --> 02:13.880
I played a little bit of that just because I realized that there is an update to it and

02:13.880 --> 02:20.280
I did the update and bought the two extra shops of each kind and a few extra residential

02:20.280 --> 02:27.160
floors and, uh, added those all in there and my tower is super huge even though it technically

02:27.160 --> 02:33.000
isn't cheating anymore because, uh, the credits and stuff aren't locked but, yeah, it's still

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
cheating.

02:34.000 --> 02:38.040
Um, and, yeah, the game is still pointless.

02:38.040 --> 02:41.840
And there's no extra achievements so there's really no reason for me to actually play it

02:41.840 --> 02:44.400
but I did.

02:44.400 --> 02:50.040
And then also on iOS I checked out Katamari Amore which is the new Katamari game for,

02:50.040 --> 02:54.120
you know, the iPod, iPad, iPhone.

02:54.120 --> 02:55.120
And it's alright.

02:55.120 --> 03:00.120
I mean, once again, I don't really care too much for touch screen controls for a lot of

03:00.120 --> 03:04.400
stuff, especially, you know, when it comes to virtual thumb sticks but it's alright.

03:04.400 --> 03:10.920
It works pretty good and, um, you could check out the free version which is basically just

03:10.920 --> 03:17.520
a time trial, um, level that's only two minutes long and if you want the rest of it you can

03:17.520 --> 03:20.800
buy the download pack which is $3.99.

03:20.800 --> 03:25.080
It's alright but, uh, definitely if you're thinking about picking it up try the demo

03:25.080 --> 03:30.360
first and then if you like it then go ahead and, uh, you know, pay for the full thing.

03:30.360 --> 03:35.040
Uh, and then finally the other thing I really shouldn't have been playing is a leaked game

03:35.040 --> 03:41.560
that came out, um, it's a leaked Xbox Live arcade game called Saints Row Money Shot.

03:41.560 --> 03:46.060
Now I'm not sure if this is actually a game that got cancelled or if it's a game that's

03:46.060 --> 03:47.060
coming out.

03:47.060 --> 03:51.560
I mean, it's possible it may be coming slightly before the launch of the game because there

03:51.560 --> 03:57.200
are some, uh, unlocks for Saints Row the Third in the game itself.

03:57.200 --> 04:02.600
You can unlock the hover bike and this, uh, sniper outfit and one of the sniper rifles.

04:02.600 --> 04:08.040
Uh, but basically the whole game's premise is very similar to, like, the movie Wanted

04:08.040 --> 04:14.120
or at least a section of it where you're firing the sniper rifle, um, and actually controlling

04:14.120 --> 04:20.400
the trajectory of the bullet as you're, you know, flying to your intended target.

04:20.400 --> 04:25.080
And so you can hit different things that will interact with the environment, um, like you'll

04:25.080 --> 04:30.720
have different goals like, you know, kill three pigeons, um, you know, get a bunch of

04:30.720 --> 04:35.520
close calls and that kind of thing and you unlock different bullets that have, you know,

04:35.520 --> 04:40.120
uh, more speed, more, uh, turning ability, that kind of stuff.

04:40.120 --> 04:44.380
But I mean, seriously, when they're moving faster, it's a lot harder to actually play

04:44.380 --> 04:45.380
the game.

04:45.380 --> 04:50.080
But, um, some of the cool stuff you can do, you know, there's one part where you hit a

04:50.080 --> 04:54.160
wine bottle of this couple that's, you know, sitting there having a nice dinner in their,

04:54.160 --> 05:00.600
you know, condo or apartment and that unfortunately causes the bottle to shatter and hit the candle

05:00.600 --> 05:05.720
that's on the table and they both catch it on fire, or another one where it knocks out

05:05.720 --> 05:12.360
the cane of an old woman and there's implied, you know, oral sex there and funny stuff like

05:12.360 --> 05:13.360
that.

05:13.360 --> 05:16.600
But, uh, you know, kind of the Saints Row over the top humor to go along with it.

05:16.600 --> 05:18.400
Rated E for Everyone.

05:18.400 --> 05:19.400
Of course.

05:19.400 --> 05:25.960
Um, so it may be something that's still coming, um, it's definitely not the, uh, Saints Row

05:25.960 --> 05:30.080
drive-by game that was supposed to become an Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network.

05:30.080 --> 05:34.000
That was gonna be kind of like its own thing and that was the one that was supposed to

05:34.000 --> 05:35.280
come to the 3DS.

05:35.280 --> 05:43.520
Uh, but this game may very well come to Xbox Live Arcade, um, I would imagine this month

05:43.520 --> 05:47.480
if it's gonna come at all, um, I don't know.

05:47.480 --> 05:48.480
It was alright.

05:48.480 --> 05:52.760
It was a little bit boring because there's only really three story levels.

05:52.760 --> 05:58.240
The rest are kind of practice training levels, but then again, this isn't really a finished

05:58.240 --> 05:59.240
build of the game.

05:59.240 --> 06:02.760
It's something that came out back in June, but I don't know.

06:02.760 --> 06:03.760
It'll be cool.

06:03.760 --> 06:07.560
I definitely would want to check out the full version if it did come out just at the very

06:07.560 --> 06:09.760
least for the unlocks.

06:09.760 --> 06:13.440
Um, and that's pretty much it.

06:13.440 --> 06:15.440
That's all I've been playing.

06:15.440 --> 06:18.040
Well, sweetie?

06:18.040 --> 06:19.040
Yes.

06:19.040 --> 06:23.000
What have you been playing?

06:23.000 --> 06:25.560
I played some Tetris DS.

06:25.560 --> 06:26.560
Woo!

06:26.560 --> 06:27.720
You've been watching a lot of videos.

06:27.720 --> 06:33.320
Yeah, I spent a little time in the vault last week and, uh, played some Genesis stuff.

06:33.320 --> 06:35.320
Besides that, nothing really current.

06:35.320 --> 06:38.320
No, but you have been watching a lot of videos.

06:38.320 --> 06:39.320
I watched a couple.

06:39.320 --> 06:43.280
I watched a playthrough of Sapphire today, now it's kind of a cool game.

06:43.280 --> 06:44.280
I love that game.

06:44.280 --> 06:46.280
You didn't even know what it was.

06:46.280 --> 06:47.280
What's this?

06:47.280 --> 06:50.440
Well, no, I just walked in and it looked like a tank game for a minute and I was like, wait,

06:50.440 --> 06:51.440
that's not a tank game.

06:51.440 --> 06:52.440
It doesn't look like a tank game at all.

06:52.440 --> 06:54.120
This is a big skull and I forgot that level, so shut up.

06:54.120 --> 06:55.120
You know, you know what?

06:55.120 --> 06:56.120
Here we're talking about.

06:56.120 --> 06:57.120
Okay, you're fired.

06:57.120 --> 06:58.120
Ah.

06:58.120 --> 07:01.120
Everyone, Dan's kicked off the show.

07:01.120 --> 07:02.120
Damn it.

07:02.120 --> 07:05.120
Okay, you're rehired.

07:05.120 --> 07:07.120
If you go get me something to drink.

07:07.120 --> 07:08.120
No.

07:08.120 --> 07:11.400
Okay, you're fired again.

07:11.400 --> 07:15.120
So anyway, a little bit of housekeeping.

07:15.120 --> 07:19.120
Basically, Rob's at Disneyland and we're all super jealous.

07:19.120 --> 07:21.120
Well, at least I am.

07:21.120 --> 07:23.560
Dan, are you super jealous?

07:23.560 --> 07:26.400
I really want to see Space Mountain Ghost Galaxy.

07:26.400 --> 07:32.120
Well, if all plans out, we're going, but not now.

07:32.120 --> 07:33.120
Maybe.

07:33.120 --> 07:34.120
Maybe.

07:34.120 --> 07:41.080
So anyway, let's go ahead and move on from, let's move past Rob's absence and I'm over

07:41.080 --> 07:42.080
it.

07:42.080 --> 07:43.080
I'm over it.

07:43.080 --> 07:44.520
I was a little upset for a while, but now I'm over it.

07:44.520 --> 07:46.840
So how about we launch into the first story?

07:46.840 --> 07:52.840
Sure, let's talk about the new Xbox 360 dashboard that's going to be coming out later this year.

07:52.840 --> 07:55.800
Of course, it's assumed to be coming out sometime in the fall.

07:55.800 --> 08:02.000
That's usually when their fall dashboards come out and yes, it's actually been leaked

08:02.000 --> 08:07.920
according to an internal memo from PayPal, which is going to be part of the new dashboard.

08:07.920 --> 08:11.040
They're going to be adding PayPal payments.

08:11.040 --> 08:18.040
It's listed the release of this as November 15th and of course the dashboard update kind

08:18.040 --> 08:22.840
of refreshes the whole look of it, kind of gives it the Windows phone, Windows 8 kind

08:22.840 --> 08:26.960
of looked to the whole thing, which I kind of hate, but whatever.

08:26.960 --> 08:34.240
But yeah, it's right now, November 15th is kind of the target date.

08:34.240 --> 08:35.760
I mean, it's not a big surprise.

08:35.760 --> 08:42.320
It's usually around between the end of October to the second week of November.

08:42.320 --> 08:47.620
In fact, I think last year is about the same time anyways.

08:47.620 --> 08:48.620
So we have that.

08:48.620 --> 08:56.120
Of course, some more information regarding the supposed Xbox TV service they're going

08:56.120 --> 09:00.760
to be having, some of the content providers that they're going to be featuring on this

09:00.760 --> 09:05.720
according to Bloomberg, Comcast, Verizon.

09:05.720 --> 09:16.280
They're also expecting the HBO, Crackle, Bravo, Syfy, LoveFilm and a lot more.

09:16.280 --> 09:20.480
I guess also some stuff from Amazon as well.

09:20.480 --> 09:24.480
So it looks like they're going to be trying to source content from, now I think not only

09:24.480 --> 09:31.440
just cable providers, but actual cable content providers on top of just actually the cable

09:31.440 --> 09:32.440
companies.

09:32.440 --> 09:39.400
So maybe, for example, if you don't have cable, you may not be just locked out of all this,

09:39.400 --> 09:45.140
which would be nice because I would prefer not to have cable, but getting a somewhat

09:45.140 --> 09:50.920
okay deal right now, but in a year's time that may change and it'd be nice to have some

09:50.920 --> 09:55.380
extra sources of content other than the internet.

09:55.380 --> 10:00.520
And of course, I'll probably get a nice little peek of this pretty soon considering that

10:00.520 --> 10:08.360
the dev kit dashboard update that's the preview for this fall thing also leaked to the internet

10:08.360 --> 10:16.440
and been taken down pretty quickly, but it happened to snag a copy for my dev kit before

10:16.440 --> 10:20.160
I did get taken down, so I will get a chance to check that out.

10:20.160 --> 10:25.200
Although based on the YouTube videos I've seen, it's still rather boring because it's

10:25.200 --> 10:27.560
basically what you see in the screenshots.

10:27.560 --> 10:30.240
Because it's an Xbox menu.

10:30.240 --> 10:35.840
Well, it's like I don't understand with each update, they kind of make it worse.

10:35.840 --> 10:38.040
Bring back the blades, dammit.

10:38.040 --> 10:41.040
I mean, that's what I use pretty much now anyways, it's just the blades.

10:41.040 --> 10:44.280
Just hit the guide button, blades come up, and I'm hoping that's still the case with

10:44.280 --> 10:49.640
this because I just really don't care for the new update.

10:49.640 --> 10:53.340
And I understand why they're doing it, it's because they can say, hey, look at all this

10:53.340 --> 10:54.640
ad space we've got.

10:54.640 --> 10:58.960
We can advertise games, we can advertise services, we can have third party ads.

10:58.960 --> 11:04.200
I mean, that's really what it's come down to and that's kind of scary if you think about

11:04.200 --> 11:06.880
it because they're gonna do the same thing with Windows 8.

11:06.880 --> 11:10.880
Thankfully with Windows 8 you can turn that off, kind of like you can turn off Media Center,

11:10.880 --> 11:13.280
but I don't know.

11:13.280 --> 11:17.760
I wish it was optional like Media Center.

11:17.760 --> 11:21.640
I would think by now we have the technology to where we can customize the way that the

11:21.640 --> 11:22.640
dashboard looks.

11:22.640 --> 11:25.440
If I want the Windows 8 look, cool, I can do that.

11:25.440 --> 11:28.380
If I want the old one, cool, I should be able to do that as well.

11:28.380 --> 11:31.960
You know what I like about the updates to the dashboard, and it's not really even specific

11:31.960 --> 11:36.060
to the dashboard but just part of the whole update package, I like the fact that they

11:36.060 --> 11:39.060
stopped making the avatars look retarded.

11:39.060 --> 11:42.360
They like re-proportioned them a little bit so their heads aren't all stupidly huge and

11:42.360 --> 11:46.240
they look a little bit more like people but they still look like avatars.

11:46.240 --> 11:47.520
That's awesome.

11:47.520 --> 11:48.720
The Miis still look like bobbleheads.

11:48.720 --> 11:49.720
Yeah, but Miis...

11:49.720 --> 11:50.720
They're supposed to look like bobbleheads.

11:50.720 --> 11:52.220
Miis always sucked.

11:52.220 --> 11:56.160
The Xbox ones, I thought, weren't supposed to have that bobbleheaded look so I like it

11:56.160 --> 11:57.160
too.

11:57.160 --> 11:58.160
Right.

11:58.160 --> 12:01.680
The avatars are like kind of neat but the Miis, yeah, were always just sort of creepy

12:01.680 --> 12:02.680
looking.

12:02.680 --> 12:03.680
Yeah.

12:03.680 --> 12:04.680
Yeah.

12:04.680 --> 12:09.040
So, I don't know, we'll just...

12:09.040 --> 12:13.860
It's only, what, a month away so, I mean, whatever.

12:13.860 --> 12:18.640
I'm just glad I'm not participating in the fall preview because I fucking hated that.

12:18.640 --> 12:22.560
It's just like, oh hey look, we're pushing another dashboard update to you.

12:22.560 --> 12:23.560
Every day.

12:23.560 --> 12:24.560
Twice a day.

12:24.560 --> 12:29.920
It's like, ugh, I have to sit here for another ten minutes while this shit downloads.

12:29.920 --> 12:30.920
It wasn't worth it.

12:30.920 --> 12:34.740
And I didn't even get anything free out of it like the people that tested, was it the

12:34.740 --> 12:42.680
last dashboard thing with the XGT3 stuff where you got a free copy of Reach.

12:42.680 --> 12:43.680
That didn't even work.

12:43.680 --> 12:45.680
Well, at least when they updated it.

12:45.680 --> 12:49.680
Well, you still get a games on demand version so it's...

12:49.680 --> 12:50.680
Sweet.

12:50.680 --> 12:52.680
Yeah, it's not too bad.

12:52.680 --> 12:55.320
If you don't like hard drive space, it's great.

12:55.320 --> 12:56.880
My turn?

12:56.880 --> 12:57.880
Yes.

12:57.880 --> 12:58.880
Okay.

12:58.880 --> 13:00.440
Hey, guess what?

13:00.440 --> 13:03.800
Microsoft's coming out with a new Windows phone that nobody's gonna buy.

13:03.800 --> 13:04.800
Who's surprised?

13:04.800 --> 13:09.840
It has swappable controller pads so you can have a keyboard, a touch screen, an extended

13:09.840 --> 13:12.100
battery or a game controller.

13:12.100 --> 13:16.960
The problem is, it's a Windows phone and everybody hates Windows phones.

13:16.960 --> 13:18.640
Totally hate Windows phones.

13:18.640 --> 13:19.640
Microsoft doesn't hate Windows phones.

13:19.640 --> 13:25.900
I mean, after all, they're redesigning Windows to look like they're Windows phones.

13:25.900 --> 13:28.720
They're just redesigning Windows to work on tablets.

13:28.720 --> 13:30.200
That's the future for Microsoft.

13:30.200 --> 13:31.200
They wanna...

13:31.200 --> 13:32.200
They wanna get into the tablet business.

13:32.200 --> 13:34.200
Well, and you can turn it off.

13:34.200 --> 13:35.200
The phone business would be...

13:35.200 --> 13:36.200
What, the phone?

13:36.200 --> 13:37.200
No, with the PC version.

13:37.200 --> 13:38.440
Turn what off?

13:38.440 --> 13:41.520
You can turn off that tablet interface and go back to a classic interface on Windows

13:41.520 --> 13:42.520
8.

13:42.520 --> 13:44.520
Yeah, I understand that, but the damages are even done as far as I know.

13:44.520 --> 13:47.520
You mean you can make Windows look like Windows?

13:47.520 --> 13:49.800
Score!

13:49.800 --> 13:56.760
I'm really sad that they took out the support to make Windows look like Windows 3.1.

13:56.760 --> 13:59.040
You can make Windows look like old Windows?

13:59.040 --> 14:00.040
Score!

14:00.040 --> 14:01.040
Really?

14:01.040 --> 14:03.280
I am so ready for Windows to be radically different.

14:03.280 --> 14:04.720
I mean, it's fine.

14:04.720 --> 14:08.960
Windows is Windows and you're used to Windows being what it is, but it is sort of like,

14:08.960 --> 14:14.120
man, I sure would like to see Windows do something different.

14:14.120 --> 14:16.600
I don't really think Windows now.

14:16.600 --> 14:23.840
There's not anything I've done and said, you know, I really wish Windows 7 did this.

14:23.840 --> 14:25.520
I'm fine with Windows 7.

14:25.520 --> 14:27.120
Windows 7 does everything I need to do.

14:27.120 --> 14:32.140
I don't need to interact with social networks any more than I already am.

14:32.140 --> 14:34.960
I don't need them to post an update.

14:34.960 --> 14:36.560
Matt just opened calculator.

14:36.560 --> 14:37.560
Yeah.

14:37.560 --> 14:39.880
No one fucking cares.

14:39.880 --> 14:42.180
You know what's going to happen is they're going to get this whole thing with perfect

14:42.180 --> 14:46.480
social network integration and right then the whole world's going to be like, eh, we're

14:46.480 --> 14:48.160
done with social networks.

14:48.160 --> 14:51.720
Let's move on to something else that's lame.

14:51.720 --> 14:52.720
You know what?

14:52.720 --> 14:57.620
Your article, that top attachment, I swear, looked like a Wiimote.

14:57.620 --> 14:58.760
That's right.

14:58.760 --> 15:01.160
It's the new Wii Microsoft phone.

15:01.160 --> 15:04.720
Mic, Wii, I got nothing.

15:04.720 --> 15:05.720
Micro Wii.

15:05.720 --> 15:06.720
Nice.

15:06.720 --> 15:07.720
Yeah.

15:07.720 --> 15:08.720
Well, I don't know.

15:08.720 --> 15:13.920
That kind of goes with what our friend used to call Microsoft, microflacid.

15:13.920 --> 15:20.720
Anyway, how about some news that makes everybody happy because it has to do with portal.

15:20.720 --> 15:25.920
There is new download content for portal 2, which is called Peer Review, and it is a free

15:25.920 --> 15:32.240
download for PC, PS3, and Xbox 360, available on October 4th.

15:32.240 --> 15:39.320
It has more of the co-op modes for Atlas and Peabody, who are the cutie little robots that

15:39.320 --> 15:43.160
like to hug so much, and hey, this article has my desktop wallpaper on it.

15:43.160 --> 15:47.500
GLaDOS will be there, so that's going to be cool, and there's also a challenge mode for

15:47.500 --> 15:53.920
co-op and single player that has leaderboard support, and if you want some more free stuff,

15:53.920 --> 15:59.680
the third and fourth group of tracks from the portal 2 soundtrack, Music to Test by,

15:59.680 --> 16:03.460
is on Valve's site right now, which I need to download them.

16:03.460 --> 16:08.280
Probably some more ringtones and message sounds, I bet.

16:08.280 --> 16:09.280
Cool.

16:09.280 --> 16:14.640
I actually have the Turret Symphony as one of my ringtones.

16:14.640 --> 16:19.240
The little one that you hear, the four little turrets practicing in the little level.

16:19.240 --> 16:21.000
You must be so proud.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
I am!

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
Shut up!

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
I'm not proud of your face.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.600
Wah wah.

16:26.600 --> 16:27.600
Okay.

16:27.600 --> 16:29.360
Well that's it for that one.

16:29.360 --> 16:35.960
Well, this is a little bit interesting, and a little bit disappointing, because I kind

16:35.960 --> 16:40.720
of, I read this, and you know, I was craving Subway anyways because I had a coupon for

16:40.720 --> 16:43.320
it, and although it wasn't before the store went to.

16:43.320 --> 16:44.800
Yeah, why do you need a coupon for Subway?

16:44.800 --> 16:45.800
It's all $5 anyway.

16:45.800 --> 16:49.760
Well yeah, I understand that, but you know, I wasn't gonna actually use it right now,

16:49.760 --> 16:54.880
and it was for like, you know, get a bunch of like, footlongs for free and that kind

16:54.880 --> 16:55.880
of stuff.

16:55.880 --> 16:56.880
Multiple sandwiches.

16:56.880 --> 16:57.880
That's a pretty good coupon.

16:57.880 --> 17:02.800
Um, but, so I went down to Subway because they've got this thing going on right now

17:02.800 --> 17:09.840
with Uncharted 3, where if you go down to Subway, you can actually get a code to play

17:09.840 --> 17:16.400
in the, I guess the multiplayer beta or multiplayer portion of Uncharted 3 throughout the month

17:16.400 --> 17:17.400
of October.

17:17.400 --> 17:18.400
Dude, I saw that!

17:18.400 --> 17:20.400
I should have got a drink.

17:20.400 --> 17:26.680
Yeah, it's a 30 ounce drink, and basically, not only do you get a PlayStation Network

17:26.680 --> 17:32.600
code for that, to play the multiplayer portion of the game, but you also get an exclusive

17:32.600 --> 17:40.760
item which earns you the ability to do the Subway footlong taunt, you know, the $5 footlong

17:40.760 --> 17:42.240
thing that they do in the commercials.

17:42.240 --> 17:43.240
Nice.

17:43.240 --> 17:48.560
So you have that taunt as well, that you can earn from getting a drink.

17:48.560 --> 17:52.640
And here I was all ready to get a drink, in fact...

17:52.640 --> 17:53.640
You even got a drink!

17:53.640 --> 17:57.760
Yeah, well no, to go back to what I was talking about earlier before the show started, how

17:57.760 --> 18:02.920
the person at Subway was really stupid, I asked for a large drink, and she rang me up

18:02.920 --> 18:06.640
for a small drink, because she is stupid.

18:06.640 --> 18:08.740
Did you reach her across the counter and pimp-slap her?

18:08.740 --> 18:12.760
I should have, but once again though, I looked at their cups, and their cups did not have

18:12.760 --> 18:15.200
the new stuff on them.

18:15.200 --> 18:21.760
I'm sure that participation will vary by location based on whether they're phasing out their

18:21.760 --> 18:23.440
old inventory or not, so...

18:23.440 --> 18:26.760
You know, often those promotions are even no purchase required, you can probably just

18:26.760 --> 18:29.880
ask for a code and they have to give it to you.

18:29.880 --> 18:34.880
Maybe, but I'm sure that this woman would have not known what the hell I was talking

18:34.880 --> 18:35.880
about.

18:35.880 --> 18:37.520
Should have been like, footlongs are $5!

18:37.520 --> 18:38.520
Woo!

18:38.520 --> 18:39.520
Exactly.

18:39.520 --> 18:40.520
Yay!

18:40.520 --> 18:41.520
Footlongs $5, yay!

18:41.520 --> 18:46.840
And they're probably trying to get you really psyched up about the online portion of Uncharted

18:46.840 --> 18:50.560
3, because the online portion will require a Playstation Network pass.

18:50.560 --> 18:55.840
Yes, Sony has of course jumped on board with the whole online pass thing, starting with

18:55.840 --> 19:01.440
Resistance 3, and of course, unsurprisingly, continuing on with Uncharted 3.

19:01.440 --> 19:08.240
And it's a one-time use code that will require all players to enter it in, in order to play

19:08.240 --> 19:11.200
the online portion of Uncharted 3.

19:11.200 --> 19:17.240
Although, if you're like me, you probably couldn't give two shits about the online portion

19:17.240 --> 19:19.480
of Uncharted 3.

19:19.480 --> 19:23.480
So I don't know.

19:23.480 --> 19:27.400
But yeah, if you buy the game used, you're gonna have to pay $10 if someone's already

19:27.400 --> 19:30.680
activated the code.

19:30.680 --> 19:35.440
And of course, this is to combat piracy, but really it's just, you know, make a little

19:35.440 --> 19:38.080
money on the back end from used copies.

19:38.080 --> 19:43.480
It's what you call a shameless cash grab, and a way to put the screws into GameStop,

19:43.480 --> 19:46.080
and which I'm kind of down with, because fuck GameStop!

19:46.080 --> 19:48.800
No, I don't have any problem with GameStop, really.

19:48.800 --> 19:50.800
I have a problem with GameStop.

19:50.800 --> 19:53.440
Yeah, me too.

19:53.440 --> 19:55.680
Hey, you like movies?

19:55.680 --> 19:56.680
No.

19:56.680 --> 19:57.680
Yes.

19:57.680 --> 19:58.680
You like zombies?

19:58.680 --> 19:59.680
Yes.

19:59.680 --> 20:00.680
You like movies about zombies?

20:00.680 --> 20:01.680
Yes.

20:01.680 --> 20:03.080
You like movies based on video games?

20:03.080 --> 20:04.200
What?

20:04.200 --> 20:07.880
Looks like Dead Island might already be getting a movie.

20:07.880 --> 20:09.040
People are already looking at it.

20:09.040 --> 20:15.400
Looks like Lionsgate and producer Sean Daniel, who apparently was responsible for Tombstone

20:15.400 --> 20:22.240
and Dazed and Confused, two very decent movies, is thinking, hey, this looks like it'd be

20:22.240 --> 20:27.480
a great movie, but seriously, all zombie movies are the goddamn same anyway, except for, you

20:27.480 --> 20:30.200
know, Shaun of the Dead, which was hilarious.

20:30.200 --> 20:31.680
So guess what?

20:31.680 --> 20:32.680
I like Wild Zero.

20:32.680 --> 20:33.680
Good.

20:33.680 --> 20:35.680
Which I still have your copy.

20:35.680 --> 20:36.680
Great.

20:36.680 --> 20:37.680
Huh?

20:37.680 --> 20:38.680
Nothing.

20:38.680 --> 20:39.680
Wild Zero?

20:39.680 --> 20:40.680
Yeah.

20:40.680 --> 20:41.680
If you like zombie movies, there's more coming.

20:41.680 --> 20:45.840
If you like Dead Island, watch the big screen.

20:45.840 --> 20:51.080
And I mean, they're trying to make it an emotional zombie movie, so they're basing it off a trailer,

20:51.080 --> 20:55.320
which, which is great because the trailer had nothing to do with the actual game.

20:55.320 --> 20:59.320
Aren't zombie movies always pretty emotional?

20:59.320 --> 21:01.720
Zombies are into the pursuit of brains.

21:01.720 --> 21:03.920
That's heartfelt right there.

21:03.920 --> 21:06.440
They're like, I feel for their play.

21:06.440 --> 21:08.680
And people run in fear with great passion.

21:08.680 --> 21:09.680
People?

21:09.680 --> 21:11.960
There's people in these movies?

21:11.960 --> 21:13.760
Yeah, the people that end up being food.

21:13.760 --> 21:15.440
I thought those people were just food.

21:15.440 --> 21:18.720
And you know, what's kind of annoying though is all these zombie movies nowadays, especially

21:18.720 --> 21:21.640
starting after, what was it, 28 days.

21:21.640 --> 21:24.880
Yeah, they all have the smart killer zombies.

21:24.880 --> 21:25.880
Like the ones that run.

21:25.880 --> 21:26.880
I mean, come on.

21:26.880 --> 21:30.360
They don't have the shuffling undead because the shuffling undead aren't interesting anymore.

21:30.360 --> 21:33.800
But the funny thing about zombie movies was it was always just about the fact that they

21:33.800 --> 21:36.200
were slow but unstoppable.

21:36.200 --> 21:38.680
Now they're all fast and unstoppable.

21:38.680 --> 21:40.800
And they're fast and unstoppable and they think.

21:40.800 --> 21:42.860
Which you know what that really makes them?

21:42.860 --> 21:45.960
Not fucking zombies.

21:45.960 --> 21:47.080
Really guys.

21:47.080 --> 21:51.400
I want them to do a zombie movie where the people aren't zombies but all the animals

21:51.400 --> 21:52.400
are.

21:52.400 --> 21:53.520
You know what would be great?

21:53.520 --> 21:54.520
Like zombie cows.

21:54.520 --> 21:55.520
They did a movie about Resident Evil.

21:55.520 --> 21:59.000
Yeah, well kind of like Pet Sematary, yeah, but they're all like church and the people

21:59.000 --> 22:00.000
don't come back.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.780
But they're attacking all the people.

22:02.780 --> 22:03.780
Zombie animals.

22:03.780 --> 22:05.520
But would they turn the people into zombies?

22:05.520 --> 22:08.480
No, they just eat them.

22:08.480 --> 22:09.480
I'd watch that.

22:09.480 --> 22:11.000
That'd be a good movie.

22:11.000 --> 22:14.160
Copyright Dark Sakura 2011 blah blah blah blah.

22:14.160 --> 22:15.600
That movie sounds really stupid.

22:15.600 --> 22:16.600
So do you.

22:16.600 --> 22:17.600
Okay, next story.

22:17.600 --> 22:18.600
You got me there.

22:18.600 --> 22:19.600
I love you.

22:19.600 --> 22:20.760
You mean it.

22:20.760 --> 22:21.760
Next story.

22:21.760 --> 22:22.760
How about Nintendo Power?

22:22.760 --> 22:25.320
Who of us grew up with Nintendo Power?

22:25.320 --> 22:26.320
All of us.

22:26.320 --> 22:27.320
Get the power.

22:27.320 --> 22:28.320
Nintendo Power.

22:28.320 --> 22:30.040
I was published in Nintendo Power once.

22:30.040 --> 22:31.040
What?

22:31.040 --> 22:32.040
You're lying.

22:32.040 --> 22:33.040
I'm not lying.

22:33.040 --> 22:34.040
Prove it.

22:34.040 --> 22:39.120
I'll have to find the issue but it was the one doing the immortality thing for Mega Man

22:39.120 --> 22:40.120
3.

22:40.120 --> 22:45.240
Well I happen to know a guy who has almost every issue of Nintendo Power so we're gonna

22:45.240 --> 22:46.240
find out.

22:46.240 --> 22:47.240
Okay.

22:47.240 --> 22:48.240
Fine.

22:48.240 --> 22:50.240
So anyway.

22:50.240 --> 22:53.140
They are being distributed.

22:53.140 --> 22:59.380
It's distributed in the US by the same people that do Playstation, the official Xbox magazine,

22:59.380 --> 23:01.160
and of course there's Nintendo Power.

23:01.160 --> 23:04.680
They do Best Spies at Gamer and PC Gamer.

23:04.680 --> 23:14.240
And they're actually saying that since people are, you know, first of all, poor, broke,

23:14.240 --> 23:17.240
you can't see the magazine very well at the newsstand, I mean it's really not getting

23:17.240 --> 23:23.520
a big order, and the digital revenues are where the money is, that basically they're

23:23.520 --> 23:29.040
thinking about changing how they do Nintendo Power in the US.

23:29.040 --> 23:34.200
They are thinking about doing it digital only instead of doing it in print, but then again

23:34.200 --> 23:39.640
as someone pointed out earlier in chat, EGM went away and they came back.

23:39.640 --> 23:42.080
So nice.

23:42.080 --> 23:49.440
In my world, when Nintendo quit publishing Nintendo Power, it quit being Nintendo Power.

23:49.440 --> 23:51.440
It just did.

23:51.440 --> 23:53.120
It was the end of an era then.

23:53.120 --> 23:58.060
Now if it goes away, it's just another magazine going away, but when Nintendo published it,

23:58.060 --> 24:00.520
it was the official Nintendo propaganda magazine.

24:00.520 --> 24:02.800
That would be like Napster going away now.

24:02.800 --> 24:04.680
It's like, who cares.

24:04.680 --> 24:08.440
In fact, when he said Napster, I'm like, is Napster still around?

24:08.440 --> 24:09.440
Yeah it is.

24:09.440 --> 24:13.040
It's a legit music service now.

24:13.040 --> 24:14.040
No one cared.

24:14.040 --> 24:16.560
When they're like, we're going legit, everyone's like, we're going elsewhere.

24:16.560 --> 24:17.560
Exactly.

24:17.560 --> 24:20.880
I was like, wait a minute, I can't steal music for free?

24:20.880 --> 24:21.880
Fuck this.

24:21.880 --> 24:22.880
I'm out.

24:22.880 --> 24:28.480
Well according to Gamasutra, Future is going to be doing their update for their plan starting

24:28.480 --> 24:36.160
on I believe, they're going to show what the plan is for November 24th and later, through

24:36.160 --> 24:37.160
2012.

24:37.160 --> 24:38.760
If anyone cares.

24:38.760 --> 24:39.760
Some people care.

24:39.760 --> 24:40.760
Damn it.

24:40.760 --> 24:41.760
I care.

24:41.760 --> 24:42.760
A little.

24:42.760 --> 24:43.760
Next.

24:43.760 --> 24:48.920
Well cool, let's talk a little bit about what's coming out soon.

24:48.920 --> 24:49.920
Starting with October.

24:49.920 --> 24:50.920
In the U.S.

24:50.920 --> 24:51.920
Oh wait, isn't this our music?

24:51.920 --> 24:54.480
No, we don't have music for this section of the show.

24:54.480 --> 24:55.920
Well, I did it anyway.

24:55.920 --> 24:56.920
We have music.

24:56.920 --> 24:58.560
Okay, so what's coming out?

24:58.560 --> 25:00.920
I refuse to have music.

25:00.920 --> 25:01.920
Fine.

25:01.920 --> 25:02.920
Anyways.

25:02.920 --> 25:10.040
Today, actually, Tetris Axis came out on Nintendo 3DS, and it was great.

25:10.040 --> 25:14.800
Earlier this week, Kotaku had actually run a little bit of a, they do this stupid video

25:14.800 --> 25:19.640
blogging crap for some of the games that they get to test and stuff, like, ooh look, we

25:19.640 --> 25:20.640
got the test.

25:20.640 --> 25:26.280
And they were showing off the augmented reality portions of Tetris Axis, and man, that looks

25:26.280 --> 25:27.660
retarded.

25:27.660 --> 25:33.240
I'm so glad that I'm not a big Tetris fan, because it's just like, hey, look, I gotta

25:33.240 --> 25:37.600
put a card down on a table and I gotta walk around the table while I play Tetris.

25:37.600 --> 25:38.600
What's the point to that?

25:38.600 --> 25:40.440
I mean, seriously.

25:40.440 --> 25:43.360
So that's coming out this week on the 3DS.

25:43.360 --> 25:48.240
On Xbox 360, Motion Explosion by Majesco.

25:48.240 --> 25:51.320
It's just a weird mini-game collection for the Kinect.

25:51.320 --> 25:53.160
What do you expect?

25:53.160 --> 25:56.840
Dark Souls on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

25:56.840 --> 25:59.040
Yes, I tend to rhyme sometimes.

25:59.040 --> 26:02.520
Sometimes you're clever.

26:02.520 --> 26:08.480
Gunslingers coming out on the Wii, and this is kind of an on-rails, western shooter game.

26:08.480 --> 26:17.840
NBA 2K12 coming out on PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, and PSP.

26:17.840 --> 26:23.200
Rage coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.

26:23.200 --> 26:28.620
Age of Enigma, The Secret of the Sixth Ghost on PC.

26:28.620 --> 26:30.280
No idea what that is.

26:30.280 --> 26:37.680
Spider-Man Edge of Time on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, 3DS, and NDS.

26:37.680 --> 26:42.640
And hopefully it's not as terrible as X-Men Destiny, because that game has gotten some

26:42.640 --> 26:44.120
pretty terrible reviews.

26:44.120 --> 26:47.400
That game got murdered in the reviews.

26:47.400 --> 26:51.680
Oh yeah, it's really nice that you put this unfinished game out.

26:51.680 --> 26:53.680
You know what's sad about that game, too?

26:53.680 --> 27:00.840
It's made by Silicon Knights, who at one time was a really decent publisher, and now they're

27:00.840 --> 27:05.240
just bootsy.

27:05.240 --> 27:08.440
Girls Only coming out on Nintendo DS.

27:08.440 --> 27:10.080
It is for girls only.

27:10.080 --> 27:14.920
They will shoot you on sight if you try to buy that and you're not a girl.

27:14.920 --> 27:17.560
I was hoping it would be like Boobalicious or something.

27:17.560 --> 27:19.960
No, it's not that good, I'm sorry.

27:19.960 --> 27:24.920
It's just some crappy girl-targeted game.

27:24.920 --> 27:27.680
How to knit and shop.

27:27.680 --> 27:30.040
Umm, yeah.

27:30.040 --> 27:31.040
And makeup.

27:31.040 --> 27:34.400
Face Raiders Photo Finish 3DS.

27:34.400 --> 27:38.840
It's an awesome kart racing game where you can take a picture and put your face on the

27:38.840 --> 27:44.960
kart or the person driving the kart, because everybody really wants to do that in a stupid

27:44.960 --> 27:45.960
kart racing game.

27:45.960 --> 27:49.560
You know you can do that on the arcade version of Mario Kart?

27:49.560 --> 27:51.160
Really unaware of that.

27:51.160 --> 27:52.160
Yes.

27:52.160 --> 27:54.160
I'm so unaware of that.

27:54.160 --> 27:57.280
Glad I have no memory of doing that at my bachelor party.

27:57.280 --> 28:01.280
Oh, good.

28:01.280 --> 28:03.680
That wasn't your face.

28:03.680 --> 28:10.200
Sid Meier's Civilization V Game of the Year Edition on PC, and they made me drive as Luigi.

28:10.200 --> 28:12.280
That is just a crime right there.

28:12.280 --> 28:14.440
I think it was Luigi.

28:14.440 --> 28:16.200
I was so messed up.

28:16.200 --> 28:20.400
I have no memory of it until I saw the video.

28:20.400 --> 28:26.920
Gabrielle's Ghostly Groove on the 3DS, it's a rhythm music game.

28:26.920 --> 28:31.520
And then finally, one week from today, Just Dance 3 coming out on Xbox 360, and Wii, PlayStation

28:31.520 --> 28:37.240
3, who the hell knows when that's coming out because it's been delayed.

28:37.240 --> 28:38.800
That is it.

28:38.800 --> 28:44.600
Alright, so for everyone in, I guess this is the UK, is this all of Europe?

28:44.600 --> 28:45.600
This is UK.

28:45.600 --> 28:49.360
For everyone in the UK, here's some releases this week.

28:49.360 --> 28:55.320
Really the only one that matters, Chrono Trigger hits PSN on the 4th, Crysis for the Xbox 360

28:55.320 --> 29:03.960
and the PlayStation 3, NBA Jam on Fire Edition, which is a download, Orcs Must Die, I gotta

29:03.960 --> 29:05.360
believe that's a download, I'm not really sure.

29:05.360 --> 29:07.080
I think all those are downloads so far.

29:07.080 --> 29:12.200
Payday of the High, Sega Bass Fishing, Space Channel 5 Part 2, all that crap comes out

29:12.200 --> 29:13.340
on the 5th.

29:13.340 --> 29:16.040
It's like, really?

29:16.040 --> 29:23.340
Dark Souls for the 360 and PS3 on the 7th, NBA 2K12, Power Up Heroes and Rage, as well

29:23.340 --> 29:27.520
as the Cursed Crusade, all land on the 7th as well.

29:27.520 --> 29:31.360
I'm actually really interested to check out Crysis on 360 when that comes out, I think

29:31.360 --> 29:37.380
that's actually next week I believe, because I played it on PC and it was pretty fun up

29:37.380 --> 29:41.800
until the end where the game decided, hey, you know what, work, I don't want to do it.

29:41.800 --> 29:48.640
I'm interested to see it from a technological standpoint, Crysis, you know, was a real system

29:48.640 --> 29:49.640
killer.

29:49.640 --> 29:52.320
Yeah, it was a really unoptimized piece of shit.

29:52.320 --> 29:57.640
I can't wait to see if they manage to make it run well on the 360 and PS3, or if it's

29:57.640 --> 29:58.640
going to run like Crysis.

29:58.640 --> 30:02.680
Well, they did with Warhead, remember, they totally revamped the whole engine, it's like,

30:02.680 --> 30:06.540
oh hey, yeah, by the way, remember that game that killed all your PCs, yeah, we finally

30:06.540 --> 30:09.160
got around to optimizing it, now that could run in pretty much everything.

30:09.160 --> 30:14.600
Well, that's what I'm saying, I just want to see if it will run on the 360 and what

30:14.600 --> 30:15.600
not.

30:15.600 --> 30:17.920
I hear that, you know, my understanding is that happens a lot, and I'll ask you about

30:17.920 --> 30:20.880
this later, but I was talking to someone about GTA for the PC.

30:20.880 --> 30:24.960
Oh yeah, it's a terrible, very unoptimized, I mean.

30:24.960 --> 30:29.240
It's like, oh, it takes such a PC to run it, you know, because I saw, did you see the link

30:29.240 --> 30:33.960
that I posted to the Vice City mod that somebody did?

30:33.960 --> 30:35.680
I think I've seen those mods before.

30:35.680 --> 30:37.880
I've got to play that.

30:37.880 --> 30:39.260
That's going to be so good.

30:39.260 --> 30:43.320
But anyways, so there's the releases for the UK.

30:43.320 --> 30:46.680
I wonder what's coming out in Japan.

30:46.680 --> 30:48.760
How about Child of Eden?

30:48.760 --> 30:49.760
Coming out on the 6th.

30:49.760 --> 30:50.760
How about it?

30:50.760 --> 30:53.360
Well, this is the Xbox 360 list.

30:53.360 --> 31:02.360
F1 2011, Oga Mosokoku X, no sorry, Kyoku X, my bad, Rage, and the Gun Stringer.

31:02.360 --> 31:11.960
And then moving forward to Playstation 3, we have Major League Baseball 2K11, Child

31:11.960 --> 31:18.800
of Eden as well, and F1 2011, what, what did you say?

31:18.800 --> 31:19.800
Sorry.

31:19.800 --> 31:20.800
Oh.

31:20.800 --> 31:29.680
God of War, Chains of Olympus, and Ghost of Sparta HD, Rage, World Soccer winning 11 2012,

31:29.680 --> 31:34.640
Ace Combat, that's getting a little bit further past, my bad.

31:34.640 --> 31:40.160
On the Vita, we have nothing, because it's on the list for some stupid reason.

31:40.160 --> 31:46.840
On the PSP,.hack link, for PSP the best, it's a re-released, AKB 148, that's idled

31:46.840 --> 31:53.800
to Guam to Koshitara, and that's going to be a bunch of limited editions too.

31:53.800 --> 31:58.560
Okashi Nashima no Peter Pan, Sweet Neverland is also going to be out in a regular limited

31:58.560 --> 32:02.960
edition, and Phantom Kingdom Portable will be out on the 6th, with a limited edition

32:02.960 --> 32:03.960
as well.

32:03.960 --> 32:12.640
Tsugi no Giseisha o Oshirase Shimasu, Kimitoko no Hateru Kotanai Kurayami O is going to

32:12.640 --> 32:15.960
be out on the 6th by Booston.

32:15.960 --> 32:21.840
And let's see what else we have on the Wii, Just Dance Wii, but that's not until next

32:21.840 --> 32:23.140
week.

32:23.140 --> 32:30.820
On the 3DS we have Super Black Bass 3D Fight, which makes fishing sound cool, I guess.

32:30.820 --> 32:35.040
On the PS2, nothing, because no one care.

32:35.040 --> 32:39.400
And on the DS, nothing, although Super Scribblenuts will be coming out next week, which is kind

32:39.400 --> 32:40.760
of cool.

32:40.760 --> 32:47.360
And for Japanese PC gamers, Batman Arkham City, Battlefield 3, that's about it.

32:47.360 --> 32:48.360
Really?

32:48.360 --> 32:50.480
There's some other stuff, but they're not giving us dates.

32:50.480 --> 32:51.960
I'm surprised they're getting that so early.

32:51.960 --> 32:52.960
No one care.

32:52.960 --> 32:54.800
Arkham City is going to be awesome.

32:54.800 --> 32:57.440
Just as October is at the top of the list, so I'll set it.

32:57.440 --> 33:01.320
That's probably just sometime in October, I doubt that they're getting it that early.

33:01.320 --> 33:04.320
No, but it gives our friends overseas something to look forward to.

33:04.320 --> 33:07.400
Something you can look forward to, but when you go to the store this week, you're not

33:07.400 --> 33:08.400
going to find it there.

33:08.400 --> 33:15.160
I didn't say it was this week, I said it was this month.

33:15.160 --> 33:22.240
This is kind of strange, they've got this game coming out for iOS called Life of George.

33:22.240 --> 33:26.280
You might be thinking, is this some sort of documentary game based on George Washington?

33:26.280 --> 33:27.280
No.

33:27.280 --> 33:34.760
It's a Lego game, actually, where you're challenged to build different things that you see in

33:34.760 --> 33:39.120
this photo album using actual bricks.

33:39.120 --> 33:42.200
You buy a $30 kit from the Lego store.

33:42.200 --> 33:45.480
You've already kind of lost me there because it's a $30 kit, and I'm assuming it comes

33:45.480 --> 33:48.880
with like 10 pieces.

33:48.880 --> 33:56.440
Apparently, it comes with this green screen like a building mat, and so you're challenged

33:56.440 --> 34:01.240
to recreate 120 different models, or build your own models and then have them scanned

34:01.240 --> 34:04.040
into the game.

34:04.040 --> 34:10.680
You're awarded based on accuracy and how quick you put everything together.

34:10.680 --> 34:21.200
But really, a $30 iOS game, and I have not actually seen what this Lego kit is, but I'm

34:21.200 --> 34:26.920
going to be willing to bet that it's probably, considering the price of Legos, which is really

34:26.920 --> 34:35.520
ridiculous, it's probably like 20 pieces, so it wouldn't be that difficult to recreate

34:35.520 --> 34:36.520
everything.

34:36.520 --> 34:41.040
But just out of curiosity, let's see, Life of George.

34:41.040 --> 34:43.240
That actually does sound kind of cool.

34:43.240 --> 34:45.100
Because you're a Lego addict.

34:45.100 --> 34:48.360
And at the same time, devastatingly stupid.

34:48.360 --> 34:49.360
Whoa!

34:49.360 --> 34:50.360
Yes.

34:50.360 --> 34:51.360
I am surprised.

34:51.360 --> 34:52.920
It's actually 146 pieces.

34:52.920 --> 34:56.400
That's actually not bad for Legos.

34:56.400 --> 34:59.360
But from that picture, they're like really basic pieces.

34:59.360 --> 35:02.920
Well, yeah, I'd imagine.

35:02.920 --> 35:07.920
You know, I would probably just play with the Legos separately anyway and not care.

35:07.920 --> 35:09.220
So I'd just go buy Legos.

35:09.220 --> 35:12.120
That game better be free once you buy that stupid kit.

35:12.120 --> 35:14.120
That's all I gotta say.

35:14.120 --> 35:17.280
No, it's $44.99.

35:17.280 --> 35:20.040
That sounds to me like, was it TomTom or whatever like that?

35:20.040 --> 35:22.840
Oh hey, you gotta buy this GPS thing, 70 bucks.

35:22.840 --> 35:25.680
Oh, dude, we mentioned the software's another 40.

35:25.680 --> 35:27.960
Yeah, we hate you.

35:27.960 --> 35:32.320
We want your money and you are gullible, so give it to us.

35:32.320 --> 35:33.320
How's that?

35:33.320 --> 35:34.320
Like that?

35:34.320 --> 35:35.320
Yeah.

35:35.320 --> 35:38.640
Well, how about something, you know, you could gamble on that game or you could gamble for

35:38.640 --> 35:39.640
reals.

35:39.640 --> 35:40.640
Ew.

35:40.640 --> 35:41.640
Full House Poker.

35:41.640 --> 35:43.800
Which, I actually know people who are playing this.

35:43.800 --> 35:45.640
And me, I don't like poker.

35:45.640 --> 35:49.600
I really don't like gambling games, but oh well.

35:49.600 --> 35:55.840
But the Texas Heat tournament is on day 119 on Xbox Live.

35:55.840 --> 36:04.520
And it's apparently super popular, but it's not getting a fall update, but it's not going

36:04.520 --> 36:05.520
away.

36:05.520 --> 36:09.720
They just said that they plan to refresh the Texas Heat season in the future.

36:09.720 --> 36:12.040
So what does that mean?

36:12.040 --> 36:14.580
That means that, oh, we're not gonna change anything.

36:14.580 --> 36:19.600
We're just gonna say, oh, new tournament start, here's the same thing.

36:19.600 --> 36:21.000
But it's still there if you like it.

36:21.000 --> 36:24.660
At least it's not going the way of 1 versus 100.

36:24.660 --> 36:25.660
As in, away.

36:25.660 --> 36:29.120
1 versus 100 was, like, really, really cool.

36:29.120 --> 36:30.760
Yes it was.

36:30.760 --> 36:35.520
But I would think that 1 versus 100 versus, like, I mean, this is kind of like, you know,

36:35.520 --> 36:40.400
the World Series of Poker almost, but on a very, very small scale.

36:40.400 --> 36:47.160
This I can see, you know, being able to play a lot more without actual structure in a season

36:47.160 --> 36:52.080
versus 1 versus 100, which is more of like a trivia game that's kind of, you know, host-driven

36:52.080 --> 36:54.880
and it'd be a little difficult.

36:54.880 --> 36:59.640
You know, I can see how they're able to carry it on beyond, you know, like a season.

36:59.640 --> 37:04.040
Even the 1 versus 100 extended play, though, just the practice rounds, were fun just to

37:04.040 --> 37:06.940
pop on there and play.

37:06.940 --> 37:09.120
I never played them, and I'm disappointed.

37:09.120 --> 37:14.420
I'm actually very disappointed that Bob Saget was not the host on, you know, the online

37:14.420 --> 37:15.420
version.

37:15.420 --> 37:16.420
Yeah.

37:16.420 --> 37:17.960
Bob Saget's a gangster.

37:17.960 --> 37:19.960
He's so cool.

37:19.960 --> 37:24.240
I mean, you know, actually, there's been one poker game that's come out that I like, and

37:24.240 --> 37:26.640
that's Poker Night at the Inventory.

37:26.640 --> 37:29.040
I still have got to download that.

37:29.040 --> 37:30.040
$4.

37:30.040 --> 37:33.200
Like, I watched Jamie play, see, I don't want to pay $4 for it, though.

37:33.200 --> 37:34.200
You paid $4 for it.

37:34.200 --> 37:35.200
You played it on my computer, G.

37:35.200 --> 37:36.200
I don't like your computer.

37:36.200 --> 37:37.200
Cheapo.

37:37.200 --> 37:39.000
Then put a copy of my account on your computer.

37:39.000 --> 37:42.560
See, that's what I'm talking about.

37:42.560 --> 37:43.560
Four fucking dollars.

37:43.560 --> 37:44.560
You're so Dutch.

37:44.560 --> 37:45.560
What do I look like?

37:45.560 --> 37:46.560
I'm made of money.

37:46.560 --> 37:47.560
You're so Dutch.

37:47.560 --> 37:48.560
Whatever, Jew.

37:48.560 --> 37:57.500
Okay, so anyway, how about you talk about something that actually matters to people

37:57.500 --> 38:04.360
instead of just throwing out, you know, religious and ancestry-related comments.

38:04.360 --> 38:06.840
What in the crap are you talking about?

38:06.840 --> 38:07.840
Classic game, duh.

38:07.840 --> 38:08.840
Oh, classic game.

38:08.840 --> 38:09.840
This is music for classic games.

38:09.840 --> 38:16.840
This music is entirely too happy for classic games.

38:16.840 --> 38:18.720
So start talking about it.

38:18.720 --> 38:20.520
Is this really the music for classic games?

38:20.520 --> 38:21.720
It's the intro music, dumbass.

38:21.720 --> 38:27.480
I need something cool like the black hole music from one of the Advance Wars games.

38:27.480 --> 38:28.480
That'd be amazing.

38:28.480 --> 38:29.480
How about this?

38:29.480 --> 38:30.480
All right.

38:30.480 --> 38:31.480
Anyways.

38:31.480 --> 38:32.480
Pause that for a second.

38:32.480 --> 38:35.840
I've got to play it in the background.

38:35.840 --> 38:39.280
Anyways, before we get into this whole classic game of the week thing, you know, I want to

38:39.280 --> 38:40.840
just throw this out there.

38:40.840 --> 38:45.360
The whole reason Jamie's been doing this thing for years is because it was stolen from me.

38:45.360 --> 38:47.240
I know everything about classic games.

38:47.240 --> 38:48.240
La, la, la, la, la, la, la.

38:48.240 --> 38:49.240
So just shut up.

38:49.240 --> 38:50.240
I'm going to unplug your mic.

38:50.240 --> 38:51.240
No, you're not.

38:51.240 --> 38:52.240
I know everything about classic games.

38:52.240 --> 38:53.240
I am the boss.

38:53.240 --> 38:55.360
And everybody knows this, right?

38:55.360 --> 38:56.920
I'm the master of the vault.

38:56.920 --> 38:59.800
I'm the one who keeps and maintains the collection.

38:59.800 --> 39:04.160
When Jamie comes to give you guys classic games, you know who she asks for them?

39:04.160 --> 39:05.160
Me.

39:05.160 --> 39:08.840
So anyways, if you like classic game of the week, thank you.

39:08.840 --> 39:14.120
I appreciate your work and I appreciate Jamie's work in bringing you so many classic games.

39:14.120 --> 39:15.600
Dance is not getting late tonight.

39:15.600 --> 39:16.600
Whatever.

39:16.600 --> 39:17.840
I was going to get late anyway.

39:17.840 --> 39:21.840
You can flip me the bird for like an hour if you really, really want to.

39:21.840 --> 39:22.840
But anyways.

39:22.840 --> 39:23.840
Okay.

39:23.840 --> 39:24.840
Can I play the music again?

39:24.840 --> 39:25.840
Start the music.

39:25.840 --> 39:26.840
Shut up.

39:26.840 --> 39:30.840
Still without the damn game.

39:30.840 --> 39:34.840
So anyone who recognizes this music is automatically awesome because this is the first level theme

39:34.840 --> 39:36.380
from Thunder Force 3.

39:36.380 --> 39:37.380
Thank you, Zeta.

39:37.380 --> 39:38.380
You win a cookie.

39:38.380 --> 39:43.240
Thunder Force 3 is one of the absolute best side scrolling shooters on the Genesis.

39:43.240 --> 39:45.840
I bought it when it first came out.

39:45.840 --> 39:48.040
It came out in 1990.

39:48.040 --> 39:50.880
We don't get an exact date because Wikipedia sucks rocks.

39:50.880 --> 39:52.320
It came out in 1990.

39:52.320 --> 39:57.420
I know one of the first nights it was out, I went over to software, etc. and bought it.

39:57.420 --> 40:01.920
Took it home and proceeded to have it blow my mind for like months on end.

40:01.920 --> 40:04.360
It was one of the first games to have line scrolling.

40:04.360 --> 40:06.280
It had selectable levels.

40:06.280 --> 40:09.560
It just made Thunder Force 2 look like a pile of crap.

40:09.560 --> 40:11.280
It was really that much better.

40:11.280 --> 40:16.840
In fact, Thunder Force 3 for the Genesis was so good that they took it and they made an

40:16.840 --> 40:19.640
arcade version out of the Genesis game.

40:19.640 --> 40:23.160
And then when they put it on SNES, they ported the arcade version.

40:23.160 --> 40:26.520
And it still wasn't as good, although it is a damn good SNES game.

40:26.520 --> 40:29.920
Nothing beats the original Genesis version.

40:29.920 --> 40:35.000
The basic idea is that this giant computer, get this, you'll never have seen this coming,

40:35.000 --> 40:36.600
has taken over the galaxy.

40:36.600 --> 40:37.600
Who knows?

40:37.600 --> 40:39.040
Yeah, I know.

40:39.040 --> 40:42.920
And the irony is that humanity created the giant computer.

40:42.920 --> 40:46.380
So if you haven't beaten the game, sorry about that, that was a big spoiler.

40:46.380 --> 40:51.900
And so they dispatched you to go in there with your ship, one ship, and annihilate like

40:51.900 --> 40:54.880
jillions of enemies and wipe them all out.

40:54.880 --> 41:00.200
The levels scroll every which way, the backgrounds move, you face ships that make the giant ship

41:00.200 --> 41:02.480
in R-type look like a tinker toy.

41:02.480 --> 41:03.480
Giant flowers.

41:03.480 --> 41:06.840
Yeah, yeah, you shoot some giant flowers too.

41:06.840 --> 41:09.400
Giant fish.

41:09.400 --> 41:10.400
It's awesome.

41:10.400 --> 41:12.480
It's really hard to describe how great this game is.

41:12.480 --> 41:16.320
If you can throw down an emulator or if you have to take a Genesis, like I'm sure some

41:16.320 --> 41:19.600
of you do, you really need to play this game.

41:19.600 --> 41:22.700
What else should I say about it?

41:22.700 --> 41:28.040
How about the differences between the different versions maybe?

41:28.040 --> 41:30.420
All ports of the same game.

41:30.420 --> 41:31.680
So they're essentially the same.

41:31.680 --> 41:34.720
I guess when you go to Thunder Spirits in the arcade or Thunder Spirits on the SNES

41:34.720 --> 41:38.860
or Thunder Force arcade, you lose the level select, they add in some levels from Thunder

41:38.860 --> 41:42.320
Force 2, they take out some levels from Thunder Force 3.

41:42.320 --> 41:45.140
The Genesis version is really the one to play.

41:45.140 --> 41:48.600
But if you don't happen to own a Genesis, you suck.

41:48.600 --> 41:52.280
If you don't happen to own a Genesis and you do have a SNES, you can go ahead and just

41:52.280 --> 41:53.280
get on SNES.

41:53.280 --> 41:57.400
Or if you have a Saturn, especially a Japanese Saturn, they released two collections called

41:57.400 --> 42:02.160
Thunder Force Gold Pack 1 and Thunder Force Gold Pack 2 that had all the various Thunder

42:02.160 --> 42:04.640
Force games on them.

42:04.640 --> 42:07.360
I remember you trying to play this on the Nomad and yelling at it.

42:07.360 --> 42:09.480
I beat the crap out of this game on the Nomad.

42:09.480 --> 42:11.840
I know, but you were like, the bullets are small!

42:11.840 --> 42:17.640
Well, the problem with any shooter on a handheld system is that bullets are extremely small.

42:17.640 --> 42:23.080
And in Thunder Force, even on a full-sized screen, the backgrounds move so much that

42:23.080 --> 42:26.560
you tend to lose the bullets and then you just have these phantom decks.

42:26.560 --> 42:29.000
And when you die, you lose the weapon that you collected.

42:29.000 --> 42:33.920
And it's not as big a disaster as it is in like Gradius when you die, you know, you don't

42:33.920 --> 42:39.400
start from zero, but if you really like the Hunter or Wave weapons and you get hit and

42:39.400 --> 42:44.280
lose them, then you have to, you know, soldier through without them until you get another

42:44.280 --> 42:45.280
Wave weapon.

42:45.280 --> 42:46.280
This level pisses me off.

42:46.280 --> 42:49.600
You guys should be able to see this, because this level is totally sweet.

42:49.600 --> 42:53.960
Well, how about if someone reminds me, I will repost it to our Tumblr.

42:53.960 --> 42:54.960
To your thing.

42:54.960 --> 42:57.280
I'll put it on our Tumblr.

42:57.280 --> 42:58.280
You'll tumble it.

42:58.280 --> 43:02.120
I feel like they're flying through the first level of Castlevania X.

43:02.120 --> 43:09.640
Yeah, except for like this game came out like four years before Castlevania Dracula XX,

43:09.640 --> 43:12.160
the Rondo of Blood.

43:12.160 --> 43:15.520
That's pretty cool though, but yeah, I completely suck at this game by one minute.

43:15.520 --> 43:16.520
I've tried.

43:16.520 --> 43:20.560
It's really not that hard of, there's way, way more difficult shooters.

43:20.560 --> 43:25.240
I can definitely one credit it, if not one life at any rate.

43:25.240 --> 43:27.440
Well, I think our type is harder.

43:27.440 --> 43:31.360
Oh, our type is blisteringly difficult compared to Thunder Force.

43:31.360 --> 43:34.800
Like the first time you play Thunder Force III, you think, oh, it's fast and difficult,

43:34.800 --> 43:36.400
but the weapons are awesome.

43:36.400 --> 43:41.040
When you get a powered up ship, if you're not really lame, you know, it's hard to die.

43:41.040 --> 43:43.760
Our type is just really easy to die.

43:43.760 --> 43:44.760
Yeah.

43:44.760 --> 43:46.440
The difference is our type is like a thinking man shooter.

43:46.440 --> 43:51.360
It's slow and it's all about positioning the ship and, you know, handling the obstacles

43:51.360 --> 43:52.360
correctly.

43:52.360 --> 43:54.240
Thunder Force is much more of a twitch shooter.

43:54.240 --> 43:57.160
Yeah, I see that.

43:57.160 --> 44:00.760
Well, how about some boss music before we go to break?

44:00.760 --> 44:01.760
I don't care.

44:01.760 --> 44:02.760
Play whatever you want.

44:02.760 --> 44:10.040
Shoot, shoot, bang, bang, pew, pew, lasers, pew, pew.

44:10.040 --> 44:12.920
And that is our classic game of the week.

44:12.920 --> 44:14.440
My classic game of the week.

44:14.440 --> 44:24.840
Thunder Force III on Genesis slash micro drive slash Genesis and the SNES and the arcade.

44:24.840 --> 44:27.200
And you could also play it on the Saturn.

44:27.200 --> 44:28.760
Yeah, all that too.

44:28.760 --> 44:29.760
All right.

44:29.760 --> 44:30.760
Well, guess what?

44:30.760 --> 44:35.200
That's the end of part A and I'm going to do the ritual saving of part A now so stay

44:35.200 --> 44:36.200
tuned.

44:36.200 --> 44:37.960
I will keep you occupied with Mega Man music.

44:37.960 --> 44:39.960
This is the part where we sacrifice a goat.

44:39.960 --> 44:40.960
No.

44:40.960 --> 44:43.400
Well, as long as we get to make some curry out of it later.

44:43.400 --> 44:44.400
Take that, goat.

44:44.400 --> 44:45.400
Okay.

44:45.400 --> 44:48.400
Everyone, stay tuned.

44:48.400 --> 44:57.240
And we are back from our break.

44:57.240 --> 44:58.480
Thank you for sticking with us.

44:58.480 --> 45:05.840
This is of course Orange Lounge Radio and as I said before at beginning of part A, Rob

45:05.840 --> 45:06.840
is gone.

45:06.840 --> 45:07.840
He's at Disneyland.

45:07.840 --> 45:12.580
We locked him in the firehouse in Walt's bedroom and we've taken over.

45:12.580 --> 45:18.640
So it is me tonight, DarkSakura, Loki, and that dude that I picked up on the internet,

45:18.640 --> 45:19.640
Dan.

45:19.640 --> 45:22.640
The notorious D-A-N.

45:22.640 --> 45:23.640
What what?

45:23.640 --> 45:24.640
What?

45:24.640 --> 45:25.640
What?

45:25.640 --> 45:26.640
Hearts.

45:26.640 --> 45:27.640
What?

45:27.640 --> 45:28.640
Hi.

45:28.640 --> 45:29.640
Hi.

45:29.640 --> 45:30.640
Yeah, that's Dan.

45:30.640 --> 45:31.640
I married him.

45:31.640 --> 45:32.640
I get to live with that.

45:32.640 --> 45:33.640
I love you.

45:33.640 --> 45:34.640
Anyway.

45:34.640 --> 45:35.640
Oh, sure.

45:35.640 --> 45:36.640
Yeah, sure.

45:36.640 --> 45:39.280
So how about we just go ahead and get into rapid fire news?

45:39.280 --> 45:40.280
Yes, let's.

45:40.280 --> 45:42.280
Let's talk about some of the money stuff.

45:42.280 --> 45:43.280
Yeah.

45:43.280 --> 45:44.280
Yes.

45:44.280 --> 45:45.280
Dance Dance Revolution is not gone.

45:45.280 --> 45:49.800
Surprisingly, actually, they keep announcing more tracks for Dance Dance Revolution 2, a

45:49.800 --> 45:53.760
game that's coming out on the Wii, actually in a couple weeks here.

45:53.760 --> 45:58.840
So the fourth song reveal set here, let's go down the list.

45:58.840 --> 46:01.760
We've got Dazzlin Darlin by HHH.

46:01.760 --> 46:07.960
Also the Dazzlin Darlin AKBK mix, remix by DJ Command, whoever the hell that is.

46:07.960 --> 46:13.720
Pop by DJ Taka featuring Kanako Hoshino.

46:13.720 --> 46:17.240
Fire Fire by Stripe Gold- That's an awesome name.

46:17.240 --> 46:18.560
Fire Fire.

46:18.560 --> 46:20.280
Fire Fire.

46:20.280 --> 46:28.520
Gold Rush by DJ Yoshitaka-G featuring Michael Alamode.

46:28.520 --> 46:34.200
May by Amuro vs. Killer.

46:34.200 --> 46:36.720
Second Heaven by Ryustar.

46:36.720 --> 46:42.160
She is My Wife by Superstar Mitsuro.

46:42.160 --> 46:45.040
Smooch by Korskay.

46:45.040 --> 46:48.720
Vanessa by Suzaku.

46:48.720 --> 46:55.020
And Yellow Candy by Wrist Junk and Zetta- I love the name of this one- Zetta, The World

46:55.020 --> 47:02.120
of Prime Numbers and Transcendental Being by Zettbach.

47:02.120 --> 47:08.480
And I'm very surprised to see actually a lot of Japanese tracks in Dance Dance Revolution

47:08.480 --> 47:09.480
too.

47:09.480 --> 47:14.160
I mean, you might actually have to check that out, I mean with all the songs that they're

47:14.160 --> 47:15.160
putting in there.

47:15.160 --> 47:17.000
It's amazing considering it's from Japan.

47:17.000 --> 47:21.440
But they don't always get licensed in- Not the US version, so see these games, they're

47:21.440 --> 47:27.920
coming out, they usually tend to put a lot of licensed stuff in weird old shit.

47:27.920 --> 47:30.200
But it's very surprising.

47:30.200 --> 47:32.880
Also- Does it have Boom Boom Dollar?

47:32.880 --> 47:35.080
I don't know, I haven't looked at the other ones.

47:35.080 --> 47:38.400
If it doesn't, then fuck it.

47:38.400 --> 47:44.200
Then of course also Dance Dance Revolution X2 Max, they've got the unlocked code, which

47:44.200 --> 47:50.760
is unintentionally released, apparently when you name your web pages sequentially, people

47:50.760 --> 47:54.800
are gonna figure out, hey, maybe if I change that two to a three, I'm gonna figure out

47:54.800 --> 47:56.200
what the next code is.

47:56.200 --> 48:00.040
And that's exactly what happened.

48:00.040 --> 48:06.880
So apparently the code unlocks the last few songs, which include Poseidon Chorus K Mix

48:06.880 --> 48:14.080
by Niope Underground, Kiss Kiss Kiss the AKBK Mix, remixed by DJ Command, Dazzlin Darlin

48:14.080 --> 48:20.680
the AKBK Mix, remixed by DJ Command, also from Dance Dance Revolution 2 there.

48:20.680 --> 48:31.640
If you were here, the LED G style remix by Jennifer, Kimono Princess by Jun, looks like

48:31.640 --> 48:42.200
Roppongi Evolved by Tag Underground, Antimatter by Orbit 1 and Milo, New Decade by Soda F,

48:42.200 --> 48:50.960
Possession by Tag Underground, Valkyrie Dimension by Spriggan, May by Amuro vs. the Killer,

48:50.960 --> 48:58.420
Pluto the First by Whitewall, and also the weirdly titled Zetta, The World of Prime Numbers

48:58.420 --> 49:04.520
and Transcendental Beans by Zetbach and Vanessa by Suzaku.

49:04.520 --> 49:09.920
Something called Valkyrie Dimension by Spriggan actually just sounds kinda cool.

49:09.920 --> 49:14.240
I was gonna say what, no dropout, but now I'm just wanting to see what Valkyrie Dimension

49:14.240 --> 49:15.560
by Spriggan is.

49:15.560 --> 49:21.120
Yeah, lots of cool songs, and of course, based on the last list we just read there, a lot

49:21.120 --> 49:26.320
of these can be featured in Dance Dance Revolution 2, so it might be worth checking out.

49:26.320 --> 49:30.220
And I mean, let's just put it this way, if you don't check it out right away, I can guarantee

49:30.220 --> 49:33.880
that the game will probably price drop pretty quick anyways, and it's actually not that

49:33.880 --> 49:39.000
expensive going into it, so you know, it might not hurt to check it out.

49:39.000 --> 49:43.640
After all these bundles nowadays on the Wii, like the same price as a Playstation 2 DDR

49:43.640 --> 49:49.720
game back in the day, so, you know, 50 bucks will get you a dance pad for the Wii and the

49:49.720 --> 49:50.720
game.

49:50.720 --> 49:55.320
Zeta pointed out that Soda Fujimori also did an awesome Gradius Chance Mix.

49:55.320 --> 49:56.320
Yeah.

49:56.320 --> 50:00.000
So, just thought that was interesting.

50:00.000 --> 50:01.000
That is interesting.

50:01.000 --> 50:06.080
All right, and then a little bit of music news here, ReRave, you may remember that game

50:06.080 --> 50:13.200
as a pretty awesome iOS game, rhythm music stuff, a little bit of Elite Beat Agents in

50:13.200 --> 50:18.080
there with some other stuff, of course being put together by Step Evolution's Kyle Ward

50:18.080 --> 50:20.880
and Chris Foy.

50:20.880 --> 50:26.400
It is now heading to the arcades, and in fact, the original design, and you can actually

50:26.400 --> 50:30.840
see this in the YouTube video that they first put up, actually did call for some sort of

50:30.840 --> 50:37.360
like dance mat control type thing, not sure if that's actually going to be included with

50:37.360 --> 50:44.200
it, but it's going to include a 42-inch multiplayer touchscreen with a global interactive ranking

50:44.200 --> 50:50.480
network according to the press release, and it'd be interesting to see if that actually

50:50.480 --> 50:56.440
is going to include, you know, the dance pad or whatever stage, but it is coming to arcades

50:56.440 --> 50:57.440
rather soon.

50:57.440 --> 51:05.620
Also, Song Pack 15 is out on iOS, including Pegasus by When Machines Dream, and also Rock

51:05.620 --> 51:13.240
Robotic by When Dreams Machine, or When Machines Dream, When Dreams Machine, but those are

51:13.240 --> 51:15.640
coming out, actually you can get those right now on the iOS.

51:15.640 --> 51:19.440
Now, 15 Song Packs, that's just ridiculous.

51:19.440 --> 51:24.000
That's a lot more than Konami ever did on any of their Dance Dance Revolution, you know,

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
mixes recently.

51:26.000 --> 51:32.240
Alas, well how about something that has nothing to do with DDR?

51:32.240 --> 51:36.400
So remember back in 2008, Ubisoft announced that they were going to make a game called

51:36.400 --> 51:41.160
I Am Alive, which was like a survival horror game where you're in like a city where there'd

51:41.160 --> 51:45.760
been a giant earthquake or a tsunami or something that just obliterated it, and you're trying

51:45.760 --> 51:52.200
to survive both against, you know, other people and, you know, a hostile environment and save

51:52.200 --> 51:53.840
people and survive.

51:53.840 --> 51:56.080
Yeah, that game isn't dead.

51:56.080 --> 51:58.560
They're actually just about to release it.

51:58.560 --> 52:00.240
It's going to come out this winter.

52:00.240 --> 52:01.240
Really?

52:01.240 --> 52:02.240
Really.

52:02.240 --> 52:03.240
Wow, you don't say.

52:03.240 --> 52:05.440
I was amazed when I saw the story.

52:05.440 --> 52:07.240
I was like, really?

52:07.240 --> 52:09.240
Isn't this like three or four years old?

52:09.240 --> 52:12.680
I thought that it was, for some reason I remember that being like a PS1 game.

52:12.680 --> 52:13.680
It's not even that old.

52:13.680 --> 52:16.960
I mean, it was probably a couple of years ago, because originally it was-

52:16.960 --> 52:17.960
It was 2008.

52:17.960 --> 52:18.960
Really?

52:18.960 --> 52:24.480
I thought it was 2009, because I thought that originally it was supposed to be coming out

52:24.480 --> 52:28.680
in March, and then it got pushed back again.

52:28.680 --> 52:30.280
But maybe that's March of last year.

52:30.280 --> 52:33.400
I just remember that it's like every time they started talking about that game, there

52:33.400 --> 52:37.960
was some sort of catastrophe in the world, and they were like, oh, you'd be insensitive

52:37.960 --> 52:39.280
to release this game now.

52:39.280 --> 52:40.280
Oh, come on.

52:40.280 --> 52:42.000
But I guess that- let me finish.

52:42.000 --> 52:45.360
But I guess that really what it comes down to is just that the developer couldn't get

52:45.360 --> 52:50.320
the game finished, and Ubisoft was like, okay, we'll give you more time.

52:50.320 --> 52:53.160
Okay, work on something else instead.

52:53.160 --> 52:55.680
And just, it's been back-burnered this whole time.

52:55.680 --> 53:00.000
So, if you really want to play like a three and a half year old survival horror game,

53:00.000 --> 53:04.120
because you know how great that's going to be, watch for it to be hitting shelves before

53:04.120 --> 53:05.120
Christmas.

53:05.120 --> 53:07.760
Actually, not shelves at all.

53:07.760 --> 53:09.160
Oh, is it a download?

53:09.160 --> 53:10.160
It's going to be a downloadable game.

53:10.160 --> 53:12.120
Download it off the internet before Christmas.

53:12.120 --> 53:16.080
But see, that's great though, because it's not going to be like, you know, fifty bucks

53:16.080 --> 53:17.080
or thirty bucks.

53:17.080 --> 53:18.920
It's going to be fifteen.

53:18.920 --> 53:20.400
I can deal with fifteen.

53:20.400 --> 53:21.400
Okay.

53:21.400 --> 53:24.360
They should just give it away at this point.

53:24.360 --> 53:25.360
Really?

53:25.360 --> 53:26.360
Yes.

53:26.360 --> 53:27.360
I agree.

53:27.360 --> 53:28.360
Free would be perfect.

53:28.360 --> 53:30.960
They'd probably sell a few copies.

53:30.960 --> 53:31.960
It might be awesome.

53:31.960 --> 53:33.600
You know, I'll reserve judgement on this awesomeness.

53:33.600 --> 53:36.000
You know what they need to do because of Ubisoft?

53:36.000 --> 53:37.520
The cause of the disaster was the Rabbids.

53:37.520 --> 53:39.520
Released Beyond Good and Evil 2?

53:39.520 --> 53:42.200
The Rabbids.

53:42.200 --> 53:45.080
Like you pick up a rock and it's like, AHHH!

53:45.080 --> 53:47.080
You're like, oh my god!

53:47.080 --> 53:48.080
Look out!

53:48.080 --> 53:49.080
It's going to kill me!

53:49.080 --> 53:51.000
The zombie Rabbid.

53:51.000 --> 53:54.080
And then they'll make a movie out of it and Ubisoft will get out of some of the financial

53:54.080 --> 53:55.080
trouble.

53:55.080 --> 53:56.080
I'm surprised.

53:56.080 --> 53:58.660
I thought that was actually supposed to be a series that was like a primetime comedy

53:58.660 --> 54:01.040
series with the Rabbids, but they haven't done it yet.

54:01.040 --> 54:03.120
They're kind of, you know, a one-joke character.

54:03.120 --> 54:04.120
Who cares?

54:04.120 --> 54:08.640
There's a lot of one-joke characters that still have movie after movie after movie.

54:08.640 --> 54:09.640
Yeah?

54:09.640 --> 54:16.200
I mean, you know, if you're talking about like, well, let's see, any of the dog movies

54:16.200 --> 54:18.640
that they have, like Beethoven and they made 8,000-

54:18.640 --> 54:21.760
Yeah, yeah, that's true, because they keep making fucking penguin movies.

54:21.760 --> 54:22.760
Penguins, yes.

54:22.760 --> 54:24.960
It's like, oh dear god!

54:24.960 --> 54:28.360
Disclaimer, this was supposed to be rapid fire news, everybody.

54:28.360 --> 54:30.240
Okay, uh, shut up.

54:30.240 --> 54:31.240
Hey!

54:31.240 --> 54:32.240
You shut up.

54:32.240 --> 54:33.240
I'm the boss tonight.

54:33.240 --> 54:34.240
No you're not.

54:34.240 --> 54:37.400
To rapid fire onto the next news story, yeah.

54:37.400 --> 54:42.440
You like Rock Band, you like Limp Bizkit, oh, nobody likes Limp Bizkit.

54:42.440 --> 54:47.160
Well, if you want to spend ten bucks, you can get, I guess seven bucks if you want to

54:47.160 --> 54:51.880
do it as a package, you can get four Limp Bizkit songs in your Rock Band.

54:51.880 --> 54:56.200
Gold Cobra, Nookie, My Way, and Rearranged.

54:56.200 --> 55:02.160
Plus, they're going to get you for an extra buck if you want pro guitar or bass.

55:02.160 --> 55:04.600
Goody goody gumdrops.

55:04.600 --> 55:12.920
And in some actually valuable news, the PS3 plays Blu-rays, plays games, it's okay, wait,

55:12.920 --> 55:17.760
it's going to validate its existence, because now you can get Chrono Trigger on PSN.

55:17.760 --> 55:19.720
There's nothing wrong with another version of Chrono Trigger.

55:19.720 --> 55:24.560
I can't think of one bad thing about being able to get Chrono Trigger on the PS3.

55:24.560 --> 55:28.160
They could charge 50 bucks for it, and it would still be worth the money.

55:28.160 --> 55:31.760
I ain't saying you should spend 50 bucks on Chrono Trigger, but if you did, I wouldn't

55:31.760 --> 55:32.760
be like, you're high!

55:32.760 --> 55:36.480
I'd be like, high five, Chrono Trigger kicks ass.

55:36.480 --> 55:38.880
We should actually play our SNES one again.

55:38.880 --> 55:39.880
Yes.

55:39.880 --> 55:40.880
Yes.

55:40.880 --> 55:47.520
Well, here's some news, this kind of no one cur, but Harvest Moon is going to have a partner

55:47.520 --> 55:49.680
with a farm.

55:49.680 --> 55:52.920
It's actually the Surrey Docks Farm.

55:52.920 --> 56:00.160
So they're basically going to actually link the virtual environment to the real Surrey

56:00.160 --> 56:01.520
Docks Farm.

56:01.520 --> 56:08.560
So it's official, and that's coming from Gary Jones, who is the farm manager there.

56:08.560 --> 56:12.240
He said, we got along really well with the team, and we're very impressed with the Harvest

56:12.240 --> 56:16.080
Moon games, since then we stayed in touch and will be looking to work together on future

56:16.080 --> 56:17.080
titles.

56:17.080 --> 56:21.140
So they are merging real farming with virtual farming.

56:21.140 --> 56:27.480
So when you go to milk your cute little cow, somebody's going to be milking a not so cute

56:27.480 --> 56:31.640
little, not so little, but cute cow, I guess.

56:31.640 --> 56:32.640
So yeah.

56:32.640 --> 56:33.640
Farm twinning.

56:33.640 --> 56:39.440
And when they run into that tainted beef, you will also get that tainted beef.

56:39.440 --> 56:46.560
And Frozen Synapse is a, has a new ha- is bluh bluh bluh, and you know, I would like

56:46.560 --> 56:49.760
to be able to speak English without going bluh.

56:49.760 --> 56:50.760
Bluh!

56:50.760 --> 56:51.760
Shut up.

56:51.760 --> 56:52.760
Bluh!

56:52.760 --> 56:53.760
Bluh!

56:53.760 --> 56:54.760
Bluh!

56:54.760 --> 56:55.760
You are not the count.

56:55.760 --> 57:02.240
Frozen Synapse is going to star in a new Humble Indie Bundle.

57:02.240 --> 57:03.240
Yay!

57:03.240 --> 57:05.480
We know what the Humble Indie Bundle is, don't we, Dan?

57:05.480 --> 57:07.400
I have no idea what you're talking about.

57:07.400 --> 57:10.520
That where you pay what you want, and the money gets donated.

57:10.520 --> 57:12.380
I remember reading about that.

57:12.380 --> 57:15.600
Didn't like the first time they did that, like 70% of the people just stole the game

57:15.600 --> 57:16.600
anyway?

57:16.600 --> 57:17.600
No.

57:17.600 --> 57:18.600
I don't think so.

57:18.600 --> 57:20.480
I think that they can pay a lot of money off of it.

57:20.480 --> 57:21.480
Yeah.

57:21.480 --> 57:24.040
And it's all, it's all gone to, you know, good causes.

57:24.040 --> 57:25.040
So anyway.

57:25.040 --> 57:32.200
Um, Frozen Synapse is going to be included in the bundle, and uh, if you pay more than

57:32.200 --> 57:38.880
the average price, which is more than $4.27, you also can get, um, Humble Frozen Bite Bundle,

57:38.880 --> 57:43.920
which actually includes, uh, Trine Shadowground, Shadowground Survivor, and the cancelled Jack

57:43.920 --> 57:48.720
Claw prototype, and pre-order the coming Splott.

57:48.720 --> 57:53.920
The money will go to Child's Play and the Electronic Frontier Foundation as you choose.

57:53.920 --> 57:54.920
So pretty cool, huh?

57:54.920 --> 57:55.920
Pretty cool.

57:55.920 --> 57:56.920
Pretty cool.

57:56.920 --> 58:01.920
And also, uh, Frozen Synapse is, uh, included on Linux, so that's pretty neat.

58:01.920 --> 58:04.720
And last but never least, Persona 4!

58:04.720 --> 58:09.120
For all you people who like that weird game, um, there's going to be an anime version that's

58:09.120 --> 58:12.120
coming out in the US.

58:12.120 --> 58:18.840
And it is, uh, going to be, uh, released in North America and have digital distribution.

58:18.840 --> 58:23.440
The DVD and Blu-ray version are going to be out next year, and it premieres in Japan on

58:23.440 --> 58:24.440
October 6th.

58:24.440 --> 58:28.160
You know, I was completely unaware until I was actually doing a search for, um, I was

58:28.160 --> 58:33.640
looking up an item for the new Professor Layton game coming out, and the Professor Layton

58:33.640 --> 58:36.280
anime movie is actually coming out over here in November.

58:36.280 --> 58:37.280
Really?

58:37.280 --> 58:38.280
That's cool.

58:38.280 --> 58:39.280
Which is kind of interesting.

58:39.280 --> 58:42.040
Well, something that, uh, fans of the series should be interested in too is it's actually

58:42.040 --> 58:47.600
got the same art director and the composer, um, Shigenori Soijima and Shouji Meguro.

58:47.600 --> 58:49.160
So pretty cool.

58:49.160 --> 58:53.360
Have you seen that Konami has, like, a really blatant ripoff of Professor Layton?

58:53.360 --> 58:54.360
Yes.

58:54.360 --> 58:57.080
Uh, Dr. Lorick and the something or other.

58:57.080 --> 58:58.080
I don't remember what it was.

58:58.080 --> 58:59.080
I'm going to try to find it.

58:59.080 --> 59:04.400
When I first saw it, I was really excited because I thought it was a, uh, a sequel to

59:04.400 --> 59:05.400
that doctor.

59:05.400 --> 59:06.400
Yeah.

59:06.400 --> 59:07.400
Dr. Lorick.

59:07.400 --> 59:08.400
Whatever.

59:08.400 --> 59:11.560
I thought it was a sequel to that, uh, what was it called?

59:11.560 --> 59:12.560
Like Henry Hatsworth?

59:12.560 --> 59:13.560
Yeah.

59:13.560 --> 59:14.560
Yeah.

59:14.560 --> 59:16.440
It was like a side scrolling game that, you know, I played in the store.

59:16.440 --> 59:18.720
The guys, everyone was playing in the store and they're just like, you got to try this

59:18.720 --> 59:19.720
game when I try this game.

59:19.720 --> 59:21.180
Your copy is sitting over there on my desk.

59:21.180 --> 59:23.760
This game is fucking amazing.

59:23.760 --> 59:29.160
And uh, I saw that and I saw this, this professor allow track and I was like, oh my God, is

59:29.160 --> 59:30.160
it a sequel to that?

59:30.160 --> 59:31.160
No, no.

59:31.160 --> 59:32.160
It's a Professor Layton ripoff.

59:32.160 --> 59:33.320
A really obvious one too.

59:33.320 --> 59:36.600
Like the guy looks like if he walked up to Professor Layton, they would just be like,

59:36.600 --> 59:37.600
what up?

59:37.600 --> 59:38.600
Hey, what's going on?

59:38.600 --> 59:41.600
And the guy would like twirl his mustache cause he's evil.

59:41.600 --> 59:42.600
Okay.

59:42.600 --> 59:46.720
Remember when they made like cool original games?

59:46.720 --> 59:47.720
No.

59:47.720 --> 59:52.040
Didn't they make Frogger at one time?

59:52.040 --> 59:53.160
They made Frogger.

59:53.160 --> 59:55.080
They made Gradius.

59:55.080 --> 59:58.080
They made Castlevania.

59:58.080 --> 59:59.080
What the hell?

59:59.080 --> 01:00:00.320
Okay.

01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:02.480
Let's do another Frogger game for the 3DS.

01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:04.120
Whoa, hold on.

01:00:04.120 --> 01:00:06.040
Why are you doing Frogger for the 3DS first?

01:00:06.040 --> 01:00:08.200
Gradius for the 3DS would be perfect.

01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:11.520
Dude, they should do Solar Assault for the 3DS.

01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:13.800
Solar Assault was a 3D Gradius.

01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:17.120
How about Why Why Konami World?

01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:18.120
Why?

01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:19.120
Why?

01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:20.120
Why?

01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:23.360
Why Why Konami's Why Why Racing?

01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:24.360
Ha ha ha.

01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:25.360
That game was awesome.

01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:26.360
I know.

01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:27.360
I don't know.

01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:28.360
They just...

01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:30.920
Oh, was that supposed to be the next story anyway?

01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:32.840
I think that was actually Loki's turn.

01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:33.840
I have no idea.

01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:35.240
I'm ready.

01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:39.240
So let's talk a little bit about Nielsen ratings.

01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:40.640
I don't agree with them.

01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:52.240
In fact, they have tapped what they call the top 10 anticipated games for 2011, for the

01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:54.000
fourth quarter.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.800
I'm sorry, but there's a few things missing and a few things I don't agree on.

01:00:56.800 --> 01:01:00.680
So let's go down the list real quick and I can point that stuff out.

01:01:00.680 --> 01:01:05.280
Of course, not very obvious, I'm sure.

01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:07.640
Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 is number one.

01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:08.640
That makes sense.

01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:12.680
That's probably the biggest title this year.

01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:17.880
Number two, and actually this is the top 20 to watch for the holiday of 2011, Gears of

01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:18.880
War 3.

01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:21.760
Granted, yes, that's probably a good game.

01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:26.680
I'm not sure if it's a hugely anticipated game, and this is what they're guessing are

01:01:26.680 --> 01:01:28.920
going to be the top five titles of the year.

01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:34.080
Madden NFL 12, that's a no brainer, usually the number one sports game each year.

01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:39.360
Assassin's Creed Revelations, also kind of a no brainer, kind of expect that to do pretty

01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:40.360
well.

01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:43.680
Batman Arkham City, I can see that.

01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:48.560
The Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword, yeah, that makes sense.

01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:53.240
Battlefield 3, of course, it's going to be a pretty big title.

01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:57.920
Just Dance 3, yeah, on the Wii perhaps, I can see that.

01:01:57.920 --> 01:02:02.480
NBA 2K12, also another good franchise.

01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:04.440
Game for Speed the Run usually does pretty well.

01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:11.640
Uncharted 3, Mario and Sonic at the London 2012 Olympic Games, being that that's only

01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:16.520
on the Wii, I don't know, it's a pretty good third party title for them.

01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:19.840
Lego Harry Potter years five through seven.

01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:24.780
FIFA Soccer 12, The Elder Scrolls Skyrim, see that's why I understand, The Elder Scrolls

01:02:24.780 --> 01:02:27.800
Skyrim is so down that list.

01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:30.440
That I would see doing a lot better than what they're saying.

01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:35.360
Dead Island did really well, I could see that maybe being a little higher up the list.

01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:39.320
Kinect Sports Season 2, now this is where I got to stop them.

01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:42.560
Yeah the first one did well, but I don't think the second one is going to sell that well

01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:43.940
at all.

01:02:43.940 --> 01:02:49.140
Also they have Dance Central 2 on the list, yes, I would hope that the second game will

01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:54.720
do just as well as the first game, but I don't think that it's going to.

01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:58.320
Resistance 3, that's a pretty good first party title for Sony.

01:02:58.320 --> 01:03:01.960
And finally, Deus Ex Human Revolution.

01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:04.840
Where the fuck is Saints Row the Third on this list?

01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:10.880
That game is going to do immensely well, but it's just sadly missing.

01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:15.400
Or there's like a bunch of other games that could be on this list that they're completely

01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:16.400
overlooking.

01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:19.480
No one cares about the Nilsons anyway.

01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:22.160
Yeah I mean, they're just guessing what's going to be in the top five.

01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:25.280
Nilsons don't even want to acknowledge that Saints Row the Third is going to exist.

01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:26.280
Let's be honest though.

01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:27.400
Stick to TV Nilsons.

01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:30.440
Where the fuck is Grand Theft Auto 5?

01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:32.440
It's not coming out for a while.

01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:34.440
Yeah I know.

01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:37.960
I mean I want to play Saints Row the Third because I want to play Grand Theft Auto 5.

01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:39.960
I just really really want to.

01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:43.360
Well Grand Theft Auto 5 will probably be out by about a year's time.

01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:48.640
I mean because they've already got their first half of 2012 already kind of spoken for.

01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:55.100
With Max Payne 3 and XCOM I believe are going to be the two games that, well no actually

01:03:55.100 --> 01:04:00.920
XCOM is 2K but not Rockstar but Max Payne 3 I know is their spring title.

01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:04.720
Have you seen the trailer for Max Payne 3?

01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:08.320
It started off and I was really stoked because he had hair.

01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:13.880
And then he shaved his head and I was like god damn it Max Payne looks stupid bald.

01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:16.760
It just really bothers me.

01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:19.440
Is it just because he didn't want to render hair or something like that?

01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:20.440
I don't know.

01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:23.920
It's like when Snake was old in Metal Gear Solid 4 that just pissed me off.

01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:27.120
But then they made it so I could make him look young and I liked playing with him again.

01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:30.000
I hate it when they make my game heroes look stupid.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:31.840
He did have the Burt Reynolds stash.

01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:36.880
Oh the Burt Reynolds stash was cool.

01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:41.800
But yeah I mean they've got Max Payne 3 I know is coming and Agent is supposed to be

01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:44.140
the other thing that they're working on right now.

01:04:44.140 --> 01:04:47.920
But Agent got cancelled like a long time ago.

01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:49.160
No it's still coming.

01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:51.600
Like I am alive ago.

01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:56.120
Yeah but L.A. Noire that was also thought to be cancelled for a long time and then eventually

01:04:56.120 --> 01:04:57.280
came out.

01:04:57.280 --> 01:05:00.640
Grand Theft Auto 5 I could see probably fourth quarter next year.

01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:04.240
Agent could make me wait for Grand Theft Auto 5 if it's good.

01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:07.360
I'm really excited about the possibility of Agent being good.

01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:09.360
L.A. Noire was awesome.

01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:11.360
Red Dead Redemption was awesome.

01:05:11.360 --> 01:05:15.480
You know if they keep bringing me other games to keep me busy I could like wait for GTA

01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:16.480
5.

01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:19.920
But it's like seriously I've been dying just to go back and replay the lost and damned.

01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:26.440
They don't understand how easy it is for them to in the meantime do something.

01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:31.680
Look at this trend that's going on right now with all these HD remakes of older games.

01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:38.280
Just take Grand Theft Auto 3 San Andreas San Andreas especially San Andreas.

01:05:38.280 --> 01:05:41.960
You know give it some HD graphics add multiplayer boom.

01:05:41.960 --> 01:05:43.760
Who gives a shit about Grand Theft Auto 5.

01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:49.040
I would pay for those two games just to be imported into the Grand Theft Auto 4 engine.

01:05:49.040 --> 01:05:50.040
And they've done that.

01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:51.440
That and that's all they would have to do.

01:05:51.440 --> 01:05:56.780
But I mean commercially not not as a mod but commercially if they did those games in Grand

01:05:56.780 --> 01:05:59.080
Theft Auto 4 style I would die.

01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:01.240
But that's I would pay full price for the remake.

01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:06.680
I would know you have a mod team of like maybe five people that did it in a couple months.

01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:11.000
What's it going to what's going to happen when you have Rockstar that has the fucking

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:12.480
tools to make these games.

01:06:12.480 --> 01:06:15.540
They have all the assets to make these games.

01:06:15.540 --> 01:06:18.780
How long is it going to take a team of like you know.

01:06:18.780 --> 01:06:21.400
It's like printing fucking money.

01:06:21.400 --> 01:06:23.960
It's like making your own money for God's sakes.

01:06:23.960 --> 01:06:25.660
Just release them.

01:06:25.660 --> 01:06:30.800
Give them to me and I will give you my money.

01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:32.040
It wouldn't take that much.

01:06:32.040 --> 01:06:34.400
And seriously they could just piggyback it on the rage engine.

01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:38.080
Don't have to really tweak anything just piggybacking on what it is now.

01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:40.040
And people would eat that shit.

01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:41.040
You're talking like Game of the Year.

01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:43.240
You're getting to the point where these games.

01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:47.840
I mean not that not that it's ever going to be you know irrelevant in the video game world.

01:06:47.840 --> 01:06:54.080
But GTA is kind of losing its relevance because Call of Duty has taken over so big and and

01:06:54.080 --> 01:06:58.720
people are playing other things and you haven't heard from Grand Theft Auto which was at one

01:06:58.720 --> 01:07:02.360
time the dominator of the game world.

01:07:02.360 --> 01:07:05.540
And it's just like where is it at.

01:07:05.540 --> 01:07:08.280
God damn it.

01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:09.280
I can't wait.

01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:11.660
But it's starting to piss me off.

01:07:11.660 --> 01:07:15.040
See them do an HD San Andreas and it would make sense.

01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:17.800
It would be amazing just to do that.

01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:20.680
Because it's great but it's really hard for me to go backwards.

01:07:20.680 --> 01:07:22.480
Like I had a hard time going back.

01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:26.800
I mean I played through San Andreas after I played through GTA 4 while I was waiting

01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:31.680
for the episodes from Liberty City Pack and then I was like well screw this I'll go back

01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:34.640
now and I'll play Vice City and I couldn't do it.

01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:36.960
It's just too funky.

01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:41.040
You know the games the old Grand Theft Auto games were great games for their moment but

01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:45.240
now they just they don't look very good they don't control very good other than like using

01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:49.220
cheat codes and running around and just doing messed up stuff.

01:07:49.220 --> 01:07:50.220
They're not really cool.

01:07:50.220 --> 01:07:54.440
But you can still go back and play like GTA 4 because GTA 4's got a really good physics

01:07:54.440 --> 01:07:55.440
engine.

01:07:55.440 --> 01:07:57.400
You know the driving controls are.

01:07:57.400 --> 01:08:00.480
But you know it's just it's more fun to run around in.

01:08:00.480 --> 01:08:05.760
But there's just not as much shit to do as there was in San Andreas.

01:08:05.760 --> 01:08:06.760
GTA 5.

01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:08.980
It's like printing money.

01:08:08.980 --> 01:08:09.980
Is it?

01:08:09.980 --> 01:08:10.980
Yes.

01:08:10.980 --> 01:08:11.980
Okay.

01:08:11.980 --> 01:08:12.980
I believe you.

01:08:12.980 --> 01:08:14.820
Sort of.

01:08:14.820 --> 01:08:17.560
Is there more?

01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:18.560
Battlefield 3.

01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:19.560
That's almost like printing money.

01:08:19.560 --> 01:08:20.560
Huh Dan?

01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:21.560
Oh yeah.

01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:22.560
Is that my story?

01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:23.560
Yes.

01:08:23.560 --> 01:08:24.560
Yay.

01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:25.560
Battlefield 3.

01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:26.560
Yeah.

01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:27.560
Speaking of printing money.

01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:28.560
Man.

01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:29.560
Everyone is losing their minds for Battlefield 3.

01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:33.680
Honestly I'm not even following games that close and I keep hearing about it.

01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:38.380
Well apparently EA in addition to just paying an ass load of money to once again take a

01:08:38.380 --> 01:08:43.560
shot at knocking off Call of Duty has decided that it's going to have a Battlefield 3 worldwide

01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:52.000
conquest tournament in early 2012 with 1.6 million dollars in prizes.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:53.740
That is a lot of prizes.

01:08:53.740 --> 01:08:54.880
Have you checked out the beta yet?

01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:56.080
It's free to download now.

01:08:56.080 --> 01:08:57.960
I have not checked out the beta yet.

01:08:57.960 --> 01:09:00.980
I'm not really that into FPS's.

01:09:00.980 --> 01:09:02.300
It takes a very special FPS.

01:09:02.300 --> 01:09:03.300
I did play.

01:09:03.300 --> 01:09:04.820
Where was the last Battlefield I played?

01:09:04.820 --> 01:09:06.500
Bad Company 2.

01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:09.120
And I actually dug the hell out of that.

01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:14.820
So I always want to check out the battlefields but they never hooked me honestly.

01:09:14.820 --> 01:09:18.640
I hate to admit this but I played through the first two Modern Warfares and I want to

01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:20.700
play through the third Modern Warfare.

01:09:20.700 --> 01:09:27.300
I just don't want to pay for it because I think Activision needs to be beat to death

01:09:27.300 --> 01:09:31.860
with a bag of rocks for how hard they fucked Infinity Ward.

01:09:31.860 --> 01:09:34.720
So I don't know.

01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:36.700
I'm caught between a rock and a hard place.

01:09:36.700 --> 01:09:41.940
I'd rather give Microsoft my money by that Halo remake.

01:09:41.940 --> 01:09:42.940
So we'll see what happens.

01:09:42.940 --> 01:09:46.940
I'm sure I'll give my hands on it somehow.

01:09:46.940 --> 01:09:48.420
Possibly.

01:09:48.420 --> 01:09:49.420
We'll see.

01:09:49.420 --> 01:09:54.460
Anyways, if you kick ass at Battlefield 3, enter this tournament, win some money, and

01:09:54.460 --> 01:09:57.220
hook me up for nothing.

01:09:57.220 --> 01:09:59.460
How about some frivolous lawsuits, huh?

01:09:59.460 --> 01:10:00.740
And how?

01:10:00.740 --> 01:10:08.500
Ultimate Pointer has filed patent lawsuits against Nintendo and a damn near bunch of

01:10:08.500 --> 01:10:15.740
everybody else for its, and I quote, easy deployable interactive direct appointing system

01:10:15.740 --> 01:10:18.820
and presentation control system and calibration method therefore.

01:10:18.820 --> 01:10:20.660
I call it my finger.

01:10:20.660 --> 01:10:21.660
Yeah.

01:10:21.660 --> 01:10:25.860
But they filed their patent in May of 2005.

01:10:25.860 --> 01:10:30.580
Although it didn't receive an official status until June 2010, which is four years after

01:10:30.580 --> 01:10:33.340
the Wii came out, in the US anyway.

01:10:33.340 --> 01:10:37.340
And they're also suing basically everyone that works with the Wii, like anyone who's

01:10:37.340 --> 01:10:40.460
done games for the Wii.

01:10:40.460 --> 01:10:46.000
In fact, it's included retailers who are also involved too in making, using, importing,

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:49.860
and or selling of Wii systems, games, and related accessories.

01:10:49.860 --> 01:10:51.780
Also called the accused products.

01:10:51.780 --> 01:10:52.780
Ooh.

01:10:52.780 --> 01:10:53.780
This'll get thrown out.

01:10:53.780 --> 01:10:56.400
Yeah, this is gonna get completely pissed on by.

01:10:56.400 --> 01:10:59.980
Big deal that you submitted your application prior, and why did it take them five years

01:10:59.980 --> 01:11:05.420
is what I want to know, you know, to approve their application for their patent or whatever.

01:11:05.420 --> 01:11:12.220
But regardless of that, they, they didn't get it approved in time and Nintendo had the

01:11:12.220 --> 01:11:13.220
first patent.

01:11:13.220 --> 01:11:14.220
So.

01:11:14.220 --> 01:11:15.220
Yeah.

01:11:15.220 --> 01:11:19.700
Well, they're also including like QVC and Tiger Direct, but not Amazon or Newegg.

01:11:19.700 --> 01:11:21.820
So just pick places at random that sell it.

01:11:21.820 --> 01:11:24.540
Cause I know that Amazon would just squash them.

01:11:24.540 --> 01:11:25.540
Yeah.

01:11:25.540 --> 01:11:26.540
Like Nintendo won't.

01:11:26.540 --> 01:11:27.540
Oh, QVC.

01:11:27.540 --> 01:11:28.540
I mean, even.

01:11:28.540 --> 01:11:33.500
But they're asking, asking that Nintendo of America pay a reasonable royalty due to the

01:11:33.500 --> 01:11:34.500
alleged infringement.

01:11:34.500 --> 01:11:36.460
Isn't QVC the home shopping channel?

01:11:36.460 --> 01:11:37.460
Yes, it is.

01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:41.140
You ever see the video where the guy was washing the windows and he fell off the ladder?

01:11:41.140 --> 01:11:43.900
I saw the one where the guy broke a TV with the Wiimote.

01:11:43.900 --> 01:11:45.260
That's a good one too.

01:11:45.260 --> 01:11:46.260
Yeah.

01:11:46.260 --> 01:11:49.740
Watch the QVC video where the guy, he's like up in the, up in the background demonstrating

01:11:49.740 --> 01:11:53.380
like this ladder and he just falls right off it.

01:11:53.380 --> 01:11:55.340
It's awesome.

01:11:55.340 --> 01:11:58.100
People hurting themselves on QVC is cool.

01:11:58.100 --> 01:12:02.500
I'm glad you think so.

01:12:02.500 --> 01:12:05.940
Well, how about some FUs of the Week, huh?

01:12:05.940 --> 01:12:24.780
Because I think that we're angsty people.

01:12:24.780 --> 01:12:29.860
My FU of the week goes towards hotels near Disneyland for not being cheaper.

01:12:29.860 --> 01:12:40.900
FU goes to the Superwoman at Subway who doesn't understand how to put together a stand-up

01:12:40.900 --> 01:12:41.900
drop.

01:12:41.900 --> 01:12:43.900
Or take instructions.

01:12:43.900 --> 01:12:44.900
Or turkey.

01:12:44.900 --> 01:12:50.180
Or give you a cup of Uncharted 3 demo on it.

01:12:50.180 --> 01:12:52.300
I want an FU to Ultimate Pointer.

01:12:52.300 --> 01:12:53.300
Fuck those guys.

01:12:53.300 --> 01:12:55.300
Fuck them right in the ear.

01:12:55.300 --> 01:12:56.300
Yeah.

01:12:56.300 --> 01:12:57.300
Fuck them.

01:12:57.300 --> 01:12:58.300
Fuck them.

01:12:58.300 --> 01:12:59.300
Okay.

01:12:59.300 --> 01:13:02.860
We really got our angst up quickly, didn't we?

01:13:02.860 --> 01:13:05.980
I guess we're not all that pissed because we don't have Rob's soothing voice here to

01:13:05.980 --> 01:13:07.740
keep us happy, huh?

01:13:07.740 --> 01:13:09.940
Fuck Rob for that.

01:13:09.940 --> 01:13:10.940
You know what?

01:13:10.940 --> 01:13:12.100
Fuck that guy.

01:13:12.100 --> 01:13:13.900
You like Rob.

01:13:13.900 --> 01:13:16.980
And fuck the people who keep making Penguin movies too.

01:13:16.980 --> 01:13:18.220
God damn.

01:13:18.220 --> 01:13:21.760
I was at the movie theater the other day and I mean I was there to see The Lion King 3D

01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:25.620
so you'd expect that I'm gonna see this but I saw the commercial for Happy Feet 2 fucking

01:13:25.620 --> 01:13:28.060
twice and once was enough.

01:13:28.060 --> 01:13:29.060
Dear God.

01:13:29.060 --> 01:13:32.400
Did it really need a sequel?

01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:33.400
Fuck Penguin movies.

01:13:33.400 --> 01:13:35.900
So do we have any more news, Loki?

01:13:35.900 --> 01:13:36.900
Fucking Penguin movies.

01:13:36.900 --> 01:13:37.900
Yes.

01:13:37.900 --> 01:13:41.580
In fact, I'm gonna talk a little bit and since we normally try to put a dirty story towards

01:13:41.580 --> 01:13:45.660
the end of all of our shows or at least I try to put a dirty story at the end of all

01:13:45.660 --> 01:13:50.960
of our shows, we're gonna talk a little bit about pornography because that's fun.

01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:59.780
So there's this new video, I guess if you will, called Geek Girls the Gamers and of

01:13:59.780 --> 01:14:05.240
course it is one of these genre porn videos that they're aiming towards people that play

01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:10.100
video games because you know, guys that play video games, they like watching pornography.

01:14:10.100 --> 01:14:12.460
I mean that kind of goes hand in hand.

01:14:12.460 --> 01:14:18.220
Of course, you know, they've got a few people in there that they're claiming, oh I love

01:14:18.220 --> 01:14:21.900
games and stuff like that but then they've got actually some hardcore people that have

01:14:21.900 --> 01:14:26.620
you know, the Zelda tattoos and button tattoos and all crazy shit like that which is a little

01:14:26.620 --> 01:14:32.100
bit more believable but like, you know, rather than the one time my boyfriend played a game

01:14:32.100 --> 01:14:34.740
and it was just fun.

01:14:34.740 --> 01:14:43.240
Anyways, so yeah, if you're interested, it is coming out quite soon from New Sensations

01:14:43.240 --> 01:14:51.140
and it's Geek Girls the Gamers, yes if that's not ridiculous enough like the Playboy spreads

01:14:51.140 --> 01:14:52.140
that they do.

01:14:52.140 --> 01:15:00.000
But this at least has actual people in it instead of you know, Photoshop, CG, fake characters

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.260
that are topless.

01:15:02.260 --> 01:15:06.020
Kids like boobs, especially nursing children.

01:15:06.020 --> 01:15:07.020
Yeah.

01:15:07.020 --> 01:15:10.180
Remember BMX Triple X?

01:15:10.180 --> 01:15:11.180
Yes!

01:15:11.180 --> 01:15:13.300
That game was awesomely bad.

01:15:13.300 --> 01:15:14.300
It was awesome!

01:15:14.300 --> 01:15:16.780
No, no, no, it was awesomely bad.

01:15:16.780 --> 01:15:20.660
It was like Dave Mira freestyle BMX 2 but you could be naked.

01:15:20.660 --> 01:15:24.620
But no, it was an awesome game because, not necessarily because of that, because of all

01:15:24.620 --> 01:15:29.060
the missions that they would give you like, you would have to, it's like ridiculous shit

01:15:29.060 --> 01:15:33.800
like okay, you're gonna have to pull off some tricks to get this dog horny so they'll go

01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:35.320
fuck another dog.

01:15:35.320 --> 01:15:37.940
That's literally one of the missions in the first level of the game.

01:15:37.940 --> 01:15:39.980
That is like one of like the first missions.

01:15:39.980 --> 01:15:45.040
And then another one where you have to deliver, you know, hose to, you know, their clients

01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:46.040
using your bike.

01:15:46.040 --> 01:15:47.040
On the back of your bike.

01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:48.040
I remember that one.

01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:49.260
On the back of your BMX bike.

01:15:49.260 --> 01:15:50.360
You know what was great about that?

01:15:50.360 --> 01:15:54.260
Just go to the cheat code, enter champagne room, and then you can watch all the titty

01:15:54.260 --> 01:15:55.360
videos.

01:15:55.360 --> 01:15:56.460
It's that simple.

01:15:56.460 --> 01:15:57.460
There you go.

01:15:57.460 --> 01:16:01.980
And then you could go play Matt Hoffman because Matt Hoffman was just a better game.

01:16:01.980 --> 01:16:02.980
I liked that game.

01:16:02.980 --> 01:16:04.120
I thought it was pretty good.

01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:10.060
It was ironic though that the PlayStation 2 and GameCube versions were uncensored but,

01:16:10.060 --> 01:16:12.880
or it was like the Xbox and GameCube versions were uncensored.

01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:13.880
But the...

01:16:13.880 --> 01:16:15.040
I don't know about the GameCube version.

01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:18.360
I know that they, I know that they gave me like an Xbox version.

01:16:18.360 --> 01:16:22.140
The GameCube one was uncensored because that's what I had it on.

01:16:22.140 --> 01:16:27.940
And they did some like girl family sue after the fact because she was, no that was...

01:16:27.940 --> 01:16:28.940
Dave Mira Sue.

01:16:28.940 --> 01:16:29.940
Girls Gone Wild.

01:16:29.940 --> 01:16:30.940
No, that was the um...

01:16:30.940 --> 01:16:32.380
That was the Girls Gone Wild, wasn't it?

01:16:32.380 --> 01:16:33.380
The guy game.

01:16:33.380 --> 01:16:34.380
What was it?

01:16:34.380 --> 01:16:35.380
Yeah.

01:16:35.380 --> 01:16:36.380
I don't even remember him being sued.

01:16:36.380 --> 01:16:39.180
It was just that some underage girl managed to sneak into it.

01:16:39.180 --> 01:16:41.340
And then they were like, you can't sell that game anymore.

01:16:41.340 --> 01:16:42.700
I'm like, that's fine.

01:16:42.700 --> 01:16:46.740
We weren't selling it to start with.

01:16:46.740 --> 01:16:50.420
So one more story and then we're going to open up the Skyplane.

01:16:50.420 --> 01:16:51.420
Sounds good.

01:16:51.420 --> 01:16:52.420
Oh sure.

01:16:52.420 --> 01:16:58.880
So apparently Microsoft is looking into auto mature filtering options.

01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:01.580
I don't really understand what I'm reading here.

01:17:01.580 --> 01:17:04.940
I guess they did it a while ago where you can go ahead and set the games up so they

01:17:04.940 --> 01:17:06.980
won't be quite as mature.

01:17:06.980 --> 01:17:10.000
Which I think honestly is a pretty decent idea.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:13.280
Because you know, you really want to make Gears of War a little warmer and more cuddly

01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:15.700
so your eight year old can play it.

01:17:15.700 --> 01:17:17.120
Really?

01:17:17.120 --> 01:17:19.820
They ought to make that game two ways.

01:17:19.820 --> 01:17:23.580
Violent and ultra violent.

01:17:23.580 --> 01:17:29.060
Now this is not part of a show rule but did you notice there was a story this week someone

01:17:29.060 --> 01:17:33.900
that actually built a full size Lancer out of Legos.

01:17:33.900 --> 01:17:35.660
It's like really?

01:17:35.660 --> 01:17:38.060
That dude is my hero.

01:17:38.060 --> 01:17:39.060
And it works.

01:17:39.060 --> 01:17:40.860
We were a two Lancer family at one time.

01:17:40.860 --> 01:17:44.940
No no, not Mitsubishi Lancer you dork.

01:17:44.940 --> 01:17:46.140
The gun from Gears of War.

01:17:46.140 --> 01:17:51.020
I know I was being silly.

01:17:51.020 --> 01:17:55.860
I'm opening the Skyplane now because I'm tired of listening to Dan.

01:17:55.860 --> 01:17:56.860
You live with me.

01:17:56.860 --> 01:17:58.340
You have to listen to me all the time.

01:17:58.340 --> 01:18:00.140
I could just go back to Rob's house.

01:18:00.140 --> 01:18:04.700
Kijuto brings up, they were talking about Road Rash real quick.

01:18:04.700 --> 01:18:09.180
That was one of those games, remember it was the Burnout team, Criterion I think was actually

01:18:09.180 --> 01:18:10.180
going to put out a new version.

01:18:10.180 --> 01:18:12.180
Oh my god, that would be amazing.

01:18:12.180 --> 01:18:14.180
The video was fucking amazing.

01:18:14.180 --> 01:18:17.220
You said they were going to or they are going to.

01:18:17.220 --> 01:18:18.820
Why would they not do that?

01:18:18.820 --> 01:18:20.880
They work for EA.

01:18:20.880 --> 01:18:21.880
This needs to happen.

01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:23.460
Does anybody know someone at EA?

01:18:23.460 --> 01:18:24.460
Yes.

01:18:24.460 --> 01:18:25.460
For the record.

01:18:25.460 --> 01:18:27.100
It's like don't have them make more Need for Speeds.

01:18:27.100 --> 01:18:29.740
For god sakes, have Criterion make a Road Rash.

01:18:29.740 --> 01:18:31.140
In fact, fuck that noise.

01:18:31.140 --> 01:18:34.380
Why isn't Criterion making a new Burnout?

01:18:34.380 --> 01:18:42.980
So the Skyplane is open, the number is 1-877-GAME-OLR or see us on Skype at Orange Lounge Radio.

01:18:42.980 --> 01:18:46.060
Because we're awesome.

01:18:46.060 --> 01:18:52.940
Until then, I'm going to read some of our very few tinky Twitter topics.

01:18:52.940 --> 01:18:56.740
But I don't want to use whatever song that, oh we actually have a caller.

01:18:56.740 --> 01:18:57.740
So I will answer this first.

01:18:57.740 --> 01:19:00.940
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

01:19:00.940 --> 01:19:02.540
Hey, it's CD Thunder.

01:19:02.540 --> 01:19:07.100
Hi CD Thunder, what do you have for us today?

01:19:07.100 --> 01:19:10.980
I have a couple things to discuss tonight.

01:19:10.980 --> 01:19:11.980
Okay.

01:19:11.980 --> 01:19:15.540
I, first off, I'd like to talk a little bit about Contra.

01:19:15.540 --> 01:19:16.540
Okay.

01:19:16.540 --> 01:19:19.340
Contra is so awesome.

01:19:19.340 --> 01:19:27.860
I've played the first Contra a little bit, but I just wanted to actually get your guys'

01:19:27.860 --> 01:19:32.140
opinions on Contra.

01:19:32.140 --> 01:19:36.180
Contra is if you really hate yourself and want to be defeated at every turn.

01:19:36.180 --> 01:19:41.140
Yeah, I mean, it was really hard because I couldn't even get past the first level without

01:19:41.140 --> 01:19:43.780
dying like five or six times.

01:19:43.780 --> 01:19:44.780
Practice.

01:19:44.780 --> 01:19:46.660
Contra is not very difficult.

01:19:46.660 --> 01:19:52.540
Well, it's only hard, it's not hard if you know how to play it.

01:19:52.540 --> 01:19:54.820
I really don't know how.

01:19:54.820 --> 01:19:56.740
So what was your other topic?

01:19:56.740 --> 01:19:59.740
Play the Contra on the Super NES.

01:19:59.740 --> 01:20:00.740
Say what?

01:20:00.740 --> 01:20:02.140
What was your second topic?

01:20:02.140 --> 01:20:06.580
Oh, it's about Metal Slug.

01:20:06.580 --> 01:20:07.980
I love Metal Slug.

01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:11.140
I like Camel Slug.

01:20:11.140 --> 01:20:19.020
Saw the Orange Sons Radio YouTube video that showed the inside of your vault.

01:20:19.020 --> 01:20:22.500
And I noticed they had a copy of Metal Slug Anthology.

01:20:22.500 --> 01:20:24.300
Yes, we do.

01:20:24.300 --> 01:20:25.300
Indeed.

01:20:25.300 --> 01:20:29.420
And a bunch of other different Metal Slugs somewhere on various things.

01:20:29.420 --> 01:20:32.260
Ironically, not my own, no Metal Slug for the actual Neo Geo.

01:20:32.260 --> 01:20:33.260
Metal Slug, I really like that.

01:20:33.260 --> 01:20:36.980
I mean, it's really basic.

01:20:36.980 --> 01:20:40.580
All you do is you have a character and you go around killing people.

01:20:40.580 --> 01:20:43.660
I mean, how can it get any more basic?

01:20:43.660 --> 01:20:46.260
Do you have a copy of Metal Slug Anthology?

01:20:46.260 --> 01:20:48.140
No, I don't actually.

01:20:48.140 --> 01:20:51.940
You shouldn't get one.

01:20:51.940 --> 01:20:52.940
It's really epic.

01:20:52.940 --> 01:20:57.380
It's worth owning if you're a fan of run and gun games.

01:20:57.380 --> 01:21:00.900
Basically all the Contras, all the Metal Slugs are just the best run and gun games you can

01:21:00.900 --> 01:21:01.900
get.

01:21:01.900 --> 01:21:05.380
You know, if you go out and buy them and play them, you will be happy.

01:21:05.380 --> 01:21:07.500
And happiness is what you want, right?

01:21:07.500 --> 01:21:09.740
Yeah, pretty much.

01:21:09.740 --> 01:21:10.740
Happiness in game form.

01:21:10.740 --> 01:21:13.300
Kill all who oppose you.

01:21:13.300 --> 01:21:14.300
Words to live by.

01:21:14.300 --> 01:21:15.300
Yeah.

01:21:15.300 --> 01:21:16.300
Got anything else for us tonight?

01:21:16.300 --> 01:21:19.260
Yeah, a couple last minute things.

01:21:19.260 --> 01:21:20.260
Okay.

01:21:20.260 --> 01:21:24.620
I'd like to talk about two of my favorite games to play in the arcade.

01:21:24.620 --> 01:21:27.340
How about one of your favorite games, because we've got to let other callers come in.

01:21:27.340 --> 01:21:33.060
Okay, one of my favorite arcade games to play was, I'm not sure if you've heard of this

01:21:33.060 --> 01:21:34.060
one, it's called CarnEvil.

01:21:34.060 --> 01:21:35.060
Yes, I know CarnEvil.

01:21:35.060 --> 01:21:36.060
That game was awful.

01:21:36.060 --> 01:21:37.060
That game sucks balls.

01:21:37.060 --> 01:21:40.220
Why don't you like it?

01:21:40.220 --> 01:21:41.220
I liked it.

01:21:41.220 --> 01:21:42.220
Because it was awful.

01:21:42.220 --> 01:21:43.220
It's just real.

01:21:43.220 --> 01:21:44.220
It's a gun game.

01:21:44.220 --> 01:21:45.700
It wasn't very challenging either.

01:21:45.700 --> 01:21:46.700
It wasn't a good gun game.

01:21:46.700 --> 01:21:47.700
And I hate clowns.

01:21:47.700 --> 01:21:48.700
Well, for me, it wasn't.

01:21:48.700 --> 01:21:49.700
For other people, it wasn't.

01:21:49.700 --> 01:21:50.700
But I'm glad that you like it.

01:21:50.700 --> 01:21:51.700
But it was very gory.

01:21:51.700 --> 01:21:52.700
It's very popular.

01:21:52.700 --> 01:21:53.700
That's all I really remember.

01:21:53.700 --> 01:21:54.700
You see those machines everywhere.

01:21:54.700 --> 01:21:57.820
I think that I hate clowns so much that I didn't even enjoy shooting them.

01:21:57.820 --> 01:21:58.820
You love clowns.

01:21:58.820 --> 01:21:59.820
Shut up.

01:21:59.820 --> 01:22:00.820
Oh, okay.

01:22:00.820 --> 01:22:01.820
Yeah, I can understand that.

01:22:01.820 --> 01:22:02.820
Yeah.

01:22:02.820 --> 01:22:03.820
All right, well, thanks for giving us a call today, CD Thunder.

01:22:03.820 --> 01:22:04.820
All right, thank you.

01:22:04.820 --> 01:22:05.820
I'm going.

01:22:05.820 --> 01:22:06.820
Thanks for listening.

01:22:06.820 --> 01:22:07.820
Thank you.

01:22:07.820 --> 01:22:08.820
All right.

01:22:08.820 --> 01:22:11.660
So I sent Jamie real quick, because I know this is going to make amazing radio, that

01:22:11.660 --> 01:22:16.900
trailer for the new Road Rash game.

01:22:16.900 --> 01:22:21.540
It's a pre-visual thing that this guy is working on.

01:22:21.540 --> 01:22:32.740
Dude, so we have a bike, and the life bar is a chain going to the deformed skull.

01:22:32.740 --> 01:22:33.740
Dude, that dude kicked a van.

01:22:33.740 --> 01:22:34.740
Now, kick him.

01:22:34.740 --> 01:22:35.740
Kick him.

01:22:35.740 --> 01:22:36.740
Kick him.

01:22:36.740 --> 01:22:37.740
Kick him.

01:22:37.740 --> 01:22:38.740
Kick him.

01:22:38.740 --> 01:22:39.740
In the face.

01:22:39.740 --> 01:22:40.740
Oh, oh, dude, he's grappling him.

01:22:40.740 --> 01:22:41.740
Oh, you should have pushed him into that car.

01:22:41.740 --> 01:22:42.740
I would buy like five copies of this.

01:22:42.740 --> 01:22:43.740
Oh, gato.

01:22:43.740 --> 01:22:44.740
Oh, you can see that some of the cars are untextured, so yeah.

01:22:44.740 --> 01:22:45.740
Well, yeah, it's all free bits.

01:22:45.740 --> 01:22:46.740
Yeah, the whole world's untextured.

01:22:46.740 --> 01:22:47.740
Unless he's riding a bicycle.

01:22:47.740 --> 01:22:48.740
That's pretty cool.

01:22:48.740 --> 01:22:49.740
All right, well, hey, we got another call today.

01:22:49.740 --> 01:23:09.460
So we're going to put this up on our tumbler, how's that sound?

01:23:09.460 --> 01:23:14.620
I detect so much madness.

01:23:14.620 --> 01:23:16.740
Hello, this is Orange Jones Radio, who's this?

01:23:16.740 --> 01:23:18.740
Hey, it's the one and only Ronma.

01:23:18.740 --> 01:23:19.740
Ron.

01:23:19.740 --> 01:23:20.740
Hi.

01:23:20.740 --> 01:23:21.740
How are you?

01:23:21.740 --> 01:23:22.740
Good.

01:23:22.740 --> 01:23:23.740
I'm doing good.

01:23:23.740 --> 01:23:24.740
How about you?

01:23:24.740 --> 01:23:25.740
I'm kind of wishing Rob was here.

01:23:25.740 --> 01:23:30.740
Now, before I continue, I have to tell everyone in the chat room, take two drinks.

01:23:30.740 --> 01:23:31.740
Why?

01:23:31.740 --> 01:23:37.260
Well, there is a drinking game where everyone has to do like one or two shots when I call

01:23:37.260 --> 01:23:38.260
in, so.

01:23:38.260 --> 01:23:39.260
Oh, yeah.

01:23:39.260 --> 01:23:40.260
Well, we've got apple wine.

01:23:40.260 --> 01:23:41.260
Does that count?

01:23:41.260 --> 01:23:42.260
Good enough.

01:23:42.260 --> 01:23:43.260
Okay.

01:23:43.260 --> 01:23:45.740
Well, no, I think I've got like some vodka left over from three years ago.

01:23:45.740 --> 01:23:46.740
I don't think so.

01:23:46.740 --> 01:23:52.100
I had a bottle of root beer flavored vodka in my cabinet, went looking for it the other

01:23:52.100 --> 01:23:57.100
day and it was empty and I realized my other friend who was the local Jack Daniels guy

01:23:57.100 --> 01:23:58.100
drank it.

01:23:58.100 --> 01:23:59.100
Fucking lush.

01:23:59.100 --> 01:24:00.100
Fun.

01:24:00.100 --> 01:24:03.540
And for the record, we do have that vanilla vodka on top of the fridge that I got for

01:24:03.540 --> 01:24:06.780
the party and no one ever opened, like my birthday three years ago.

01:24:06.780 --> 01:24:07.780
What?

01:24:07.780 --> 01:24:08.780
Nice.

01:24:08.780 --> 01:24:09.780
It's still there?

01:24:09.780 --> 01:24:10.780
Okay.

01:24:10.780 --> 01:24:11.780
So, hi.

01:24:11.780 --> 01:24:12.780
What's up?

01:24:12.780 --> 01:24:13.780
I think I drank that when you weren't looking.

01:24:13.780 --> 01:24:14.780
You don't drink.

01:24:14.780 --> 01:24:15.780
I drink the shit out of that vodka.

01:24:15.780 --> 01:24:16.780
I was like, clang.

01:24:16.780 --> 01:24:22.740
He has, if he had one shot, he would be red in the face and sitting on the couch falling

01:24:22.740 --> 01:24:23.740
asleep.

01:24:23.740 --> 01:24:24.740
That's not true.

01:24:24.740 --> 01:24:25.740
That is, okay, two shots.

01:24:25.740 --> 01:24:28.740
Oh, probably wouldn't even take one.

01:24:28.740 --> 01:24:29.740
See?

01:24:29.740 --> 01:24:31.740
So, Dan's a lush?

01:24:31.740 --> 01:24:32.740
No.

01:24:32.740 --> 01:24:33.740
Dan's not.

01:24:33.740 --> 01:24:34.740
Jamie's a lush.

01:24:34.740 --> 01:24:35.740
Dan's not a very good alcoholic.

01:24:35.740 --> 01:24:39.780
Well, Jamie, you and Patty would have fun together.

01:24:39.780 --> 01:24:45.340
I'd like to come out to your neck of the woods and go drinking with you and Patty.

01:24:45.340 --> 01:24:47.220
That means y'all will be raiding my liquor cabinet.

01:24:47.220 --> 01:24:48.220
Not that I would be complaining.

01:24:48.220 --> 01:24:49.220
Oh my God, no.

01:24:49.220 --> 01:24:51.580
You'd be contributing to your liquor cabinet and getting you good beer.

01:24:51.580 --> 01:24:55.220
See, that's why I have parties, to get rid of the alcohol.

01:24:55.220 --> 01:24:58.580
At the end of the night, I open up the cab and I'm like, where did all of this come from?

01:24:58.580 --> 01:25:01.220
Well, that's why for my birthday I have the beer potluck.

01:25:01.220 --> 01:25:02.220
Ah.

01:25:02.220 --> 01:25:03.220
Mm.

01:25:03.220 --> 01:25:07.680
So, so how about the show so far, huh?

01:25:07.680 --> 01:25:08.820
So far, so good.

01:25:08.820 --> 01:25:12.180
I give it three out of four train wrecks.

01:25:12.180 --> 01:25:13.180
Okay.

01:25:13.180 --> 01:25:14.820
So we're not a derpisode fully?

01:25:14.820 --> 01:25:15.820
We're a minor derp.

01:25:15.820 --> 01:25:16.820
Far from derp.

01:25:16.820 --> 01:25:18.860
What are you talking about?

01:25:18.860 --> 01:25:19.860
That's my podcast.

01:25:19.860 --> 01:25:21.060
We're the derpy ones.

01:25:21.060 --> 01:25:22.700
We can derail under five minutes.

01:25:22.700 --> 01:25:27.380
Any show that I appear on for the whole show is immediately awesome.

01:25:27.380 --> 01:25:32.100
I've just been letting them get out there testosteroneing, so it's been cool.

01:25:32.100 --> 01:25:33.100
Fair enough.

01:25:33.100 --> 01:25:35.860
So what else is on your mind?

01:25:35.860 --> 01:25:41.440
Well, I think it was last weekend, I believe, it was me, Patty, and Ziba.

01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:46.740
We went down to the Jersey Shore as Ziba played us to a classic arcade.

01:25:46.740 --> 01:25:47.740
Really?

01:25:47.740 --> 01:25:48.740
Oh, so cool.

01:25:48.740 --> 01:25:49.740
Yeah.

01:25:49.740 --> 01:25:51.300
So what all did they have in the classic arcade?

01:25:51.300 --> 01:25:53.700
Like, were there tons of pins?

01:25:53.700 --> 01:25:54.700
Quit acting like you care about classic arcade games.

01:25:54.700 --> 01:25:55.700
There were some.

01:25:55.700 --> 01:25:56.700
I think I sent you a couple of pictures.

01:25:56.700 --> 01:25:57.700
I did.

01:25:57.700 --> 01:25:58.700
They're set up.

01:25:58.700 --> 01:25:59.700
What did you play?

01:25:59.700 --> 01:26:00.700
I...

01:26:00.700 --> 01:26:01.700
Okay, what did you play?

01:26:01.700 --> 01:26:02.700
Okay, I played Super Mario Brothers.

01:26:02.700 --> 01:26:03.700
Oh, nice.

01:26:03.700 --> 01:26:05.660
First, the Super Mario Brothers is a cool machine.

01:26:05.660 --> 01:26:06.980
Yeah.

01:26:06.980 --> 01:26:10.860
I was kind of pissed that there was no gauntlet machine, because I put quarters in it like

01:26:10.860 --> 01:26:11.860
nobody else's business.

01:26:11.860 --> 01:26:13.220
That and Ninja Turtles.

01:26:13.220 --> 01:26:15.500
Yeah, those are both really good.

01:26:15.500 --> 01:26:16.500
Sweet.

01:26:16.500 --> 01:26:18.060
They're much, much better if you have friends, though.

01:26:18.060 --> 01:26:22.460
Four player gauntlet, I could spend like five bucks on without even realizing that I did

01:26:22.460 --> 01:26:23.460
it.

01:26:23.460 --> 01:26:24.460
Yeah.

01:26:24.460 --> 01:26:25.840
You just never wanted to quit playing.

01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:27.020
As long as your friends were still in it.

01:26:27.020 --> 01:26:30.540
I would give other people quarters so that they would keep playing.

01:26:30.540 --> 01:26:33.540
That was what it was like playing Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, though.

01:26:33.540 --> 01:26:37.220
You know, when you were close to the end of the game and you really wanted to make it.

01:26:37.220 --> 01:26:38.580
It's like, here, take my tokens.

01:26:38.580 --> 01:26:39.580
Cool.

01:26:39.580 --> 01:26:41.980
Ninja Turtles, though, got harder when you had more people.

01:26:41.980 --> 01:26:42.980
It was great.

01:26:42.980 --> 01:26:44.240
Gauntlet actually got easier.

01:26:44.240 --> 01:26:45.740
You could last longer.

01:26:45.740 --> 01:26:49.540
Oh, you got me thinking of Gauntlet 2 for Nintendo.

01:26:49.540 --> 01:26:51.220
I thought I had beat that game.

01:26:51.220 --> 01:26:54.060
After 150 levels, I said, the hell with it and walked away.

01:26:54.060 --> 01:26:58.420
You know, I never got Gauntlet 2 on the NES, and I really wish that I had, because it's

01:26:58.420 --> 01:27:00.740
actually kind of a cool little version.

01:27:00.740 --> 01:27:06.540
I do have Gauntlet 4 for the Genesis, which is basically Gauntlet 1 for the Genesis, and

01:27:06.540 --> 01:27:11.820
it's got a quest mode, and it's actually four players if you have a multitap, but I've never

01:27:11.820 --> 01:27:13.660
managed to get four people on it at once.

01:27:13.660 --> 01:27:15.380
It's one of the failures of my life.

01:27:15.380 --> 01:27:18.060
Well, I can get you a copy of Gauntlet 2.

01:27:18.060 --> 01:27:19.060
That's not too hard.

01:27:19.060 --> 01:27:20.620
I don't really need one at this point.

01:27:20.620 --> 01:27:24.540
I'm just saying, I never picked it up back in the day, and watching videos and stuff

01:27:24.540 --> 01:27:30.860
of it later on, I kind of wish that I had, because it looks like it was pretty choice.

01:27:30.860 --> 01:27:31.860
Indeed it was.

01:27:31.860 --> 01:27:33.380
I wish I had picked up the strategy guide for it.

01:27:33.380 --> 01:27:34.380
Oh, well.

01:27:34.380 --> 01:27:35.380
It is what it is.

01:27:35.380 --> 01:27:39.140
So, there were pinball tables there, though, right?

01:27:39.140 --> 01:27:40.140
Yes.

01:27:40.140 --> 01:27:43.940
One of my friends, Ari, he was playing pinball while I was chucking quarters into a theater

01:27:43.940 --> 01:27:46.220
of magic machine.

01:27:46.220 --> 01:27:49.460
Theater of magic is awesome.

01:27:49.460 --> 01:27:56.460
And then I left that, and I went to play this large, old-school Atari pinball machine.

01:27:56.460 --> 01:27:57.460
Was it Hercules?

01:27:57.460 --> 01:27:58.460
Yes, it was.

01:27:58.460 --> 01:27:59.460
Yes.

01:27:59.460 --> 01:28:00.460
Ah.

01:28:00.460 --> 01:28:01.660
Someone in chat mentioned Hercules.

01:28:01.660 --> 01:28:03.380
I've never played a Hercules machine.

01:28:03.380 --> 01:28:05.900
I've seen the back glass, for one.

01:28:05.900 --> 01:28:09.780
It took me five minutes, like five tries to figure out how to play this stupid thing,

01:28:09.780 --> 01:28:12.820
because I'm pulling it back thinking all I got to do is send it forward.

01:28:12.820 --> 01:28:18.900
No, I got to push back and shove it forth like a plunger to send the ball rolling.

01:28:18.900 --> 01:28:26.940
Well, that sounds like, you know, something just makes me think that I have seen one before,

01:28:26.940 --> 01:28:27.940
though, at one of the pinball.

01:28:27.940 --> 01:28:32.020
Didn't they have one at one of the pinball things we went to, Dan?

01:28:32.020 --> 01:28:33.020
I thought that they did.

01:28:33.020 --> 01:28:34.420
Did they have a Hercules?

01:28:34.420 --> 01:28:35.420
I don't think.

01:28:35.420 --> 01:28:36.420
No, they just had that giant-

01:28:36.420 --> 01:28:38.220
It was just a giant mockup.

01:28:38.220 --> 01:28:47.060
Yeah, that used a pool cue, a cue ball for the pin, for the pinball.

01:28:47.060 --> 01:28:48.140
It's kind of funny.

01:28:48.140 --> 01:28:49.140
That sounds pretty cool.

01:28:49.140 --> 01:28:52.620
It was pretty cool, but it got boring after five minutes, because I could not reach from

01:28:52.620 --> 01:28:57.500
one side to the other very easily, because my short arms.

01:28:57.500 --> 01:29:04.420
So anything else, like how classic was classic, was it just like that 80s era, or did it get

01:29:04.420 --> 01:29:10.980
into the later 90s, or was it just like early 80s to mid-90s?

01:29:10.980 --> 01:29:15.860
The only machine in this one section that was current was a DDR Max II machine.

01:29:15.860 --> 01:29:19.620
Oh, you can't have an arcade without a DDR, shoved in the summer.

01:29:19.620 --> 01:29:26.500
Everything else was just pure 80s, there was a Tapper machine, there was Frogger, no Super

01:29:26.500 --> 01:29:29.780
Sprint, there was Iron Man off-road floating around there, too.

01:29:29.780 --> 01:29:30.780
Hey, cool.

01:29:30.780 --> 01:29:31.980
Well, that's pretty awesome.

01:29:31.980 --> 01:29:36.140
I'm going to have to check that place out if I can ever get to your neck of the woods.

01:29:36.140 --> 01:29:40.260
Well, I think I have a large enough box to ship you in.

01:29:40.260 --> 01:29:42.200
I'm fragile.

01:29:42.200 --> 01:29:44.100
I will make sure of that.

01:29:44.100 --> 01:29:45.100
Fragile.

01:29:45.100 --> 01:29:46.880
Well, I'll think about it.

01:29:46.880 --> 01:29:51.300
Let me wait until this semester's over, and then I'll see if I can be shipped.

01:29:51.300 --> 01:29:52.300
Fair enough.

01:29:52.300 --> 01:29:57.180
I think Patty would love that, because she's about to spaz at her job, so...

01:29:57.180 --> 01:29:59.620
I've been hearing.

01:29:59.620 --> 01:30:02.300
Yeah, she's now an assistant manager.

01:30:02.300 --> 01:30:06.060
I feel very sorry for her.

01:30:06.060 --> 01:30:07.740
That makes two of us.

01:30:07.740 --> 01:30:08.740
Yeah.

01:30:08.740 --> 01:30:11.620
Well, you got anything else for us tonight?

01:30:11.620 --> 01:30:12.780
Um...

01:30:12.780 --> 01:30:15.940
Actually, no, that's it.

01:30:15.940 --> 01:30:16.940
All right.

01:30:16.940 --> 01:30:17.940
Well...

01:30:17.940 --> 01:30:20.800
Ronma, before you go, I want you to do something for me.

01:30:20.800 --> 01:30:21.800
That being?

01:30:21.800 --> 01:30:22.800
That being black.

01:30:22.800 --> 01:30:26.060
No, no, no, I don't stay black anymore.

01:30:26.060 --> 01:30:27.060
That's not my style.

01:30:27.060 --> 01:30:28.060
Hey!

01:30:28.060 --> 01:30:29.060
What the fuck did I say?

01:30:29.060 --> 01:30:30.060
Stay black!

01:30:30.060 --> 01:30:31.060
No, I stay nerdy, man!

01:30:31.060 --> 01:30:32.060
Stay nerdy!

01:30:32.060 --> 01:30:33.060
Stay that, too.

01:30:33.060 --> 01:30:34.060
Keep it nerdy, motherfucker.

01:30:34.060 --> 01:30:35.060
Keep it nerdy.

01:30:35.060 --> 01:30:36.060
All right.

01:30:36.060 --> 01:30:37.060
Okay.

01:30:37.060 --> 01:30:38.060
Thanks for calling in.

01:30:38.060 --> 01:30:39.060
All right.

01:30:39.060 --> 01:30:40.060
Bye, Ronchan.

01:30:40.060 --> 01:30:41.060
Bye.

01:30:41.060 --> 01:30:42.060
Stay black.

01:30:42.060 --> 01:30:43.060
Bye.

01:30:43.060 --> 01:30:44.060
All right.

01:30:44.060 --> 01:30:45.060
We will take a couple more calls.

01:30:45.060 --> 01:30:46.060
It's 1-877-AGAMEOLR.

01:30:46.060 --> 01:30:52.140
And then we'll go ahead and see what is on our Twitter.

01:30:52.140 --> 01:30:59.660
We have a mention from Niconicochan that says tweet heart.

01:30:59.660 --> 01:31:06.340
Tigerclaw sends us a story about Dota 2 wants you.

01:31:06.340 --> 01:31:07.420
Are you ready?

01:31:07.420 --> 01:31:14.700
And that's a big fan wanting a beta key that they put up a sign.

01:31:14.700 --> 01:31:16.860
So that's kind of interesting.

01:31:16.860 --> 01:31:19.180
He paid $3,000 for an electronic billboard.

01:31:19.180 --> 01:31:20.180
That's pretty crazy.

01:31:20.180 --> 01:31:21.180
He didn't actually pay $3,000.

01:31:21.180 --> 01:31:22.180
That's just photoshopped?

01:31:22.180 --> 01:31:23.180
No, no.

01:31:23.180 --> 01:31:26.980
What ended up happening is it would have cost him $3,000 to normally rent one of those signs

01:31:26.980 --> 01:31:27.980
for a month.

01:31:27.980 --> 01:31:30.300
He actually called Clear Channel in this case.

01:31:30.300 --> 01:31:31.300
Oh, yeah.

01:31:31.300 --> 01:31:32.300
And got it for free.

01:31:32.300 --> 01:31:33.300
Yeah.

01:31:33.300 --> 01:31:34.300
Got it for free.

01:31:34.300 --> 01:31:35.300
Because they were only running it for an hour.

01:31:35.300 --> 01:31:36.300
It was part of their...

01:31:36.300 --> 01:31:37.300
Because that's one of those digital billboards.

01:31:37.300 --> 01:31:38.540
So you could just take a picture of it.

01:31:38.540 --> 01:31:41.340
So he took a picture of it with his friends.

01:31:41.340 --> 01:31:43.780
Because it's a picture contest to get keys.

01:31:43.780 --> 01:31:44.780
Oh, I see.

01:31:44.780 --> 01:31:46.700
Well, that's pretty cool.

01:31:46.700 --> 01:31:48.140
The links people will go to.

01:31:48.140 --> 01:31:50.740
Guys, we're taking one more call.

01:31:50.740 --> 01:31:53.440
So that's 1877-GAME-OLR.

01:31:53.440 --> 01:31:59.340
We also have another one from Tigerclaw about Gotham City Impostors beta beginning on October

01:31:59.340 --> 01:32:01.540
5th.

01:32:01.540 --> 01:32:04.340
And that's a PC game.

01:32:04.340 --> 01:32:05.900
Weird.

01:32:05.900 --> 01:32:09.020
And Steam codes have already been mailed out to those who are accepted.

01:32:09.020 --> 01:32:12.540
And the client can be downloaded now, but the beta will not begin until next week.

01:32:12.540 --> 01:32:13.540
So yay.

01:32:13.540 --> 01:32:14.540
Any more calls?

01:32:14.540 --> 01:32:18.460
So nobody else wants to call and talk to Dan?

01:32:18.460 --> 01:32:19.460
They're afraid of you.

01:32:19.460 --> 01:32:20.940
They're intimidated by your awesomeness.

01:32:20.940 --> 01:32:23.280
Fuck you guys.

01:32:23.280 --> 01:32:24.900
Someone called Dan so I don't have to...

01:32:24.900 --> 01:32:25.900
No, no, no.

01:32:25.900 --> 01:32:28.180
I don't even want to talk to anyone anymore.

01:32:28.180 --> 01:32:29.780
Now you should extra call him.

01:32:29.780 --> 01:32:33.100
All right, well, I'm closing the Skype line.

01:32:33.100 --> 01:32:36.020
Yeah, fuck the Skype line.

01:32:36.020 --> 01:32:37.860
They're intimidated by you, I swear.

01:32:37.860 --> 01:32:40.460
You know, I can't blame them.

01:32:40.460 --> 01:32:41.780
I'm not intimidated by you.

01:32:41.780 --> 01:32:48.860
I am quite the imposing presence when I roll into the O.L.R. like, what?

01:32:48.860 --> 01:32:49.860
Yeah.

01:32:49.860 --> 01:32:54.500
Well, I guess since that's it, that's pretty much the show.

01:32:54.500 --> 01:32:56.220
So how about...

01:32:56.220 --> 01:33:00.660
And I'm not going to do a fortune cookie tonight either, so...

01:33:00.660 --> 01:33:01.660
No fortune cookie?

01:33:01.660 --> 01:33:02.660
No.

01:33:02.660 --> 01:33:03.660
All I have to do is that.

01:33:03.660 --> 01:33:04.660
Because it's a derpisode and I don't care.

01:33:04.660 --> 01:33:11.940
You should just play the quartet song again.

01:33:11.940 --> 01:33:12.940
Okay.

01:33:12.940 --> 01:33:13.940
I'll play the quartet song again.

01:33:13.940 --> 01:33:14.940
How's that sound?

01:33:14.940 --> 01:33:16.740
The quartet of loop in the future.

01:33:16.740 --> 01:33:21.940
But because you have all asked for it, I will be doing about 30 minutes to an hour of pump

01:33:21.940 --> 01:33:22.940
up volume.

01:33:22.940 --> 01:33:24.500
So stay tuned after the show.

01:33:24.500 --> 01:33:25.500
Nobody asked for that.

01:33:25.500 --> 01:33:26.500
Yes, they did.

01:33:26.500 --> 01:33:27.500
Shut up.

01:33:27.500 --> 01:33:28.500
That's like torture on the radio.

01:33:28.500 --> 01:33:30.020
No, it is not.

01:33:30.020 --> 01:33:31.020
Everyone thinks it's completely awesome.

01:33:31.020 --> 01:33:33.580
I can't help it if you are torture on the damn radio.

01:33:33.580 --> 01:33:36.300
I'm from God.

01:33:36.300 --> 01:33:38.300
You are punishment.

01:33:38.300 --> 01:33:39.300
For you.

01:33:39.300 --> 01:33:40.860
I love you.

01:33:40.860 --> 01:33:43.340
Rob's back next week, just reminding everybody.

01:33:43.340 --> 01:33:46.700
I know you guys are excited that Rob will be back.

01:33:46.700 --> 01:33:48.180
I love having you on the show.

01:33:48.180 --> 01:33:49.180
It's great.

01:33:49.180 --> 01:33:50.180
It sucks.

01:33:50.180 --> 01:33:51.180
Wouldn't you guys rather have me here than Jamie?

01:33:51.180 --> 01:33:53.020
Rob does not suck on the air.

01:33:53.020 --> 01:33:54.580
Jamie doesn't even really talk.

01:33:54.580 --> 01:33:55.900
Yes I do.

01:33:55.900 --> 01:33:57.180
You have been fucking...

01:33:57.180 --> 01:34:00.980
I could totally be on the show and you guys would almost not even notice that Jamie was

01:34:00.980 --> 01:34:03.060
gone.

01:34:03.060 --> 01:34:04.060
I have to...

01:34:04.060 --> 01:34:07.820
She looks so mad she can barely talk.

01:34:07.820 --> 01:34:11.880
I wish I would have had a picture of the look on her face a minute ago.

01:34:11.880 --> 01:34:15.540
Someone has to watch the chat room and it's usually me because I'm the only one that can

01:34:15.540 --> 01:34:21.140
keep all of these rowdy people under some semblance of not kicking each other all over

01:34:21.140 --> 01:34:22.460
the place with trouts.

01:34:22.460 --> 01:34:24.260
Dude, all the people are like cool.

01:34:24.260 --> 01:34:25.260
They are cool.

01:34:25.260 --> 01:34:26.420
They have no problem in there.

01:34:26.420 --> 01:34:28.540
You're just playing Warcraft.

01:34:28.540 --> 01:34:30.380
I do not play Warcraft during the show, Dan.

01:34:30.380 --> 01:34:33.100
That's why the band is going to suck.

01:34:33.100 --> 01:34:35.220
I can stream video while you guys do the show.

01:34:35.220 --> 01:34:38.060
It's really hard to play the board when I play that bitch.

01:34:38.060 --> 01:34:39.060
You know what?

01:34:39.060 --> 01:34:40.060
What?

01:34:40.060 --> 01:34:41.060
End of the show!

01:34:41.060 --> 01:34:42.060
Bye everybody!

01:34:42.060 --> 01:34:43.060
Goodnight!

01:34:43.060 --> 01:34:44.060
Stay black!

01:34:44.060 --> 01:34:48.060
