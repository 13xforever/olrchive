[SPEAKER_02]: Summers?

9
00:00:54,573 --> 00:01:21,689
[SPEAKER_02]: mildly caffeinated mildly caffeinated as opposed to extremely caffeinated yeah because I had to decaf coffee but there's some caffeine in it yes little bits it's decaffeinated but not uncaffeinated enough to bounce the headache say hello as well to Tech Master Loki hello who I notice has brought dinner of choice tonight an entire pizza what is this triple bacon quadruple bacon triple bacon with Red Bull what a very nerd powered dinner I love it yes

10
00:01:22,071 --> 00:01:39,723
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Blackwolf show at All Games Radio www.allgames.com Join us in our chat room if you are listening live chat.orangelaunchradio.com After all, we are the show where every gamer has a voice

11
00:01:42,044 --> 00:01:43,866
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft

12
00:02:07,321 --> 00:02:08,442
[SPEAKER_02]: I would think so.

13
00:02:08,662 --> 00:02:09,663
[SPEAKER_07]: I would hope so, man.

14
00:02:09,723 --> 00:02:12,245
[SPEAKER_07]: If he's not going to have new bumpers because of that.

15
00:02:12,405 --> 00:02:13,587
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope he did get something out of that.

16
00:02:13,807 --> 00:02:15,308
[SPEAKER_07]: He better.

17
00:02:15,628 --> 00:02:17,270
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you record a bumper for my show?

18
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:28,279
[SPEAKER_02]: What I liked, I will be 100% honest, I'm an honest radio host, I didn't hear the entire interview because we use Bobby's time to kind of get some set up and some stuff of our own done, but I heard about half of it.

19
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:32,984
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the questions that I liked was that he asked them if they'd heard the

20
00:02:33,484 --> 00:02:36,086
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure it's doable in Adobe Audition, not too difficultly.

21
00:02:36,126 --> 00:02:37,727
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably just Google, like, GLaDOS Adobe Audition.

22
00:02:37,787 --> 00:02:38,167
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

23
00:02:38,187 --> 00:02:39,508
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably a way to do it.

24
00:02:39,528 --> 00:02:41,029
[SPEAKER_02]: Bobby, by the way, is in our chat.

25
00:02:41,149 --> 00:02:41,649
[SPEAKER_02]: He says two new bumpers.

26
00:03:03,624 --> 00:03:04,005
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome!

27
00:03:05,866 --> 00:03:07,488
[SPEAKER_02]: Not one, but two.

28
00:03:10,311 --> 00:03:12,613
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, what else is going on in our worlds today?

29
00:03:13,354 --> 00:03:14,114
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to mention this.

30
00:03:15,135 --> 00:03:18,559
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually we have a little chatter here at the top of the show before we get into our gaming weeks.

31
00:03:18,579 --> 00:03:22,502
[SPEAKER_02]: I was specifically asked to mention this to you, Loki, tonight.

32
00:03:22,743 --> 00:03:23,884
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been waiting to tell you about this.

33
00:03:24,484 --> 00:03:53,386
[SPEAKER_02]: Miklatov gave me a call about two hours before we went live tonight and you know he works in gaming retail right and he sells video games and all that good stuff he wanted me to tell you about a game that came out today Skylanders Spyro Adventure I saw the ads for that on YouTube that apparently if you've been listening to the show for a few weeks you know Loki's a huge fan huge fan I love it quickly reiterate for us what is this game and why do you hate it

34
00:03:53,985 --> 00:03:58,607
[SPEAKER_07]: This game is basically everything that's wrong about Activision all lumped up into one game.

35
00:03:58,687 --> 00:04:21,096
[SPEAKER_07]: It's basically Activision taking Spyro, a franchise that was beloved years ago, turning it on its edge and basically making it this thing where instead of having download content for the game, you're going to have actual physical add-ons that you buy, as in little, I wouldn't even call them toys, they're figurines that interact with this thing they call a portal.

36
00:04:21,156 --> 00:04:22,997
[SPEAKER_07]: So you basically stick these little figurines...

37
00:04:23,497 --> 00:04:25,860
[SPEAKER_07]: on this little portal device and you get to play as those figures.

38
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:31,926
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm playing this trailer here that I'm not exactly sure what I'm going to see here because I know very little about this game.

39
00:04:32,827 --> 00:04:35,329
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess this is something like... Yeah, it's one of the toys.

40
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:36,911
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of the toys.

41
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,332
[SPEAKER_02]: I would not give that to a child.

42
00:04:38,412 --> 00:04:39,653
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a big skull.

43
00:04:41,395 --> 00:04:42,276
[SPEAKER_02]: Ghost Roshan.

44
00:04:42,376 --> 00:04:45,880
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a scary-looking demon thing with a mace for a tail.

45
00:04:47,352 --> 00:04:48,373
[SPEAKER_02]: I would buy that part, Sean.

46
00:04:48,513 --> 00:04:49,794
[SPEAKER_07]: That's more like a Morningstar.

47
00:04:49,854 --> 00:04:52,497
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so basically, though, it's a character.

48
00:04:54,699 --> 00:04:55,820
[SPEAKER_07]: It's basically a character.

49
00:04:57,141 --> 00:04:58,902
[SPEAKER_07]: You get these characters that you can play as.

50
00:04:58,942 --> 00:05:02,385
[SPEAKER_07]: It comes with three, including Spyro, which Spyro, by the way, looks like he's...

51
00:05:03,286 --> 00:05:04,687
[SPEAKER_07]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

52
00:05:29,782 --> 00:05:31,903
[SPEAKER_07]: And, might I add, they're all $8.

53
00:05:32,164 --> 00:05:43,751
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you imagine if DLC out there for your favorite game, and hell, even Marvel vs. Capcom 3, which had really expensive DLC, it was like $5 a character, I think.

54
00:05:45,027 --> 00:06:07,015
[SPEAKER_07]: 8 dollars for each individual character or you can get like a three pack I think for maybe 20 bucks or something like that it's just it's ridiculous but they're aiming this at kids because they did really well with their stupid toy titles like Zuzu Pets and Squinkies and they have a whole bunch of them coming out this November but I hate it because one

55
00:06:08,136 --> 00:06:09,717
[SPEAKER_07]: It's difficult to sell.

56
00:06:11,238 --> 00:06:13,220
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of on the back side, you don't really see any of this.

57
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,545
[SPEAKER_07]: But the way they had us set up the items and buy it and stuff is retarded.

58
00:06:21,307 --> 00:06:26,732
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, this looks like another Tony Hawk ride or something like that.

59
00:06:26,852 --> 00:06:29,975
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a peripheral game that's just not going to work.

60
00:06:30,175 --> 00:06:30,275
[SPEAKER_07]: And...

61
00:06:30,615 --> 00:06:38,158
[SPEAKER_07]: On top of that, because they're really trying to attract everybody, it's $80 to buy it on any platform, including 3DS.

62
00:06:39,179 --> 00:06:38,158
$80.

63
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,981
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Miklatov wanted me to tell you, it's selling like crazy.

64
00:06:45,501 --> 00:06:47,222
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently, they are already sold out.

65
00:06:47,822 --> 00:06:49,023
[SPEAKER_02]: It just came out today, I think.

66
00:06:49,403 --> 00:06:54,225
[SPEAKER_02]: They're already sold out of it on every platform, but the Wii, most of the characters are already gone.

67
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:56,506
[SPEAKER_02]: It's selling like crazy, apparently.

68
00:06:56,526 --> 00:06:56,726
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

69
00:06:58,206 --> 00:06:59,107
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, fantastic.

70
00:06:59,828 --> 00:07:01,249
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that was my reaction, too.

71
00:07:01,269 --> 00:07:02,010
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, great.

72
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:07,715
[SPEAKER_02]: That means it's going to end up maybe, maybe, still too early to tell, being the must-have toy this Christmas.

73
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:19,987
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, well, they're already in bed with Toys R Us, and they worked a deal with them where they get an exclusive three-character pack for that title being placed on their Hot 15 toy titles of the holiday.

74
00:07:20,007 --> 00:07:20,267
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah.

75
00:07:21,628 --> 00:07:22,829
[SPEAKER_07]: That list is trusting.

76
00:07:24,169 --> 00:07:24,489
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever.

77
00:07:24,509 --> 00:07:25,070
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

78
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:25,490
[SPEAKER_07]: Cool.

79
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:28,031
[SPEAKER_07]: If it does well for them, awesome.

80
00:07:28,051 --> 00:07:32,273
[SPEAKER_07]: But I just... I'd ask, first off, how many did they bring in?

81
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:40,777
[SPEAKER_07]: Because, you know, selling out, trust me, with the quantities that my customers are buying, selling out wouldn't be that many titles.

82
00:07:40,937 --> 00:07:41,097
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

83
00:07:41,471 --> 00:08:05,800
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, I gotta go to our chatroom at chat.orangelongery.com After all, we are the show where every gamer has a voice And not every gamer necessarily agrees Going to our chatroom, ShadowNextGen says Skylanders Spyro Adventure is the first good Spyro game in a while I'm reviewing it right now and it's a lot of fun You can beat the new Spyro game with the three included characters You are not required to buy anything else And he also says Spyro is $70, not $80, $69.99

84
00:08:11,718 --> 00:08:12,519
[SPEAKER_02]: You're wrong, Loki.

85
00:08:12,719 --> 00:08:13,480
[SPEAKER_02]: You're very wrong.

86
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,381
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm sorry.

87
00:08:16,623 --> 00:08:16,963
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

88
00:08:17,224 --> 00:08:21,067
[SPEAKER_02]: And DarkTetsuya says, I'd be willing to bet that it sells a million copies.

89
00:08:22,389 --> 00:08:24,611
[SPEAKER_02]: Invoking an old OLR joke from yesteryear.

90
00:08:25,211 --> 00:08:25,932
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you go.

91
00:08:27,193 --> 00:08:27,554
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

92
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:32,499
[SPEAKER_02]: That little clip I looked at didn't look terrible, but I can see where...

93
00:08:32,819 --> 00:08:34,199
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

94
00:09:01,428 --> 00:09:02,069
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

95
00:09:19,163 --> 00:09:20,404
[SPEAKER_07]: I just, I hate that.

96
00:09:20,604 --> 00:09:24,645
[SPEAKER_02]: So it sounds like a lot of your frustration with this game really has nothing to do with the game itself.

97
00:09:24,665 --> 00:09:25,746
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks terrible, okay?

98
00:09:25,886 --> 00:09:26,986
[SPEAKER_07]: They showed it to me.

99
00:09:27,446 --> 00:09:28,307
[SPEAKER_07]: They showed it to me.

100
00:09:28,447 --> 00:09:32,508
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually got to play a little bit of the Wii version, and I was just unimpressed.

101
00:09:32,568 --> 00:09:34,189
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just like, big fucking whoop.

102
00:09:34,329 --> 00:09:34,669
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, good.

103
00:09:35,129 --> 00:09:36,850
[SPEAKER_07]: Why do I need this stupid portal thing?

104
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:40,731
[SPEAKER_07]: Why couldn't this have easily been done in-game without any of these extra characters?

105
00:09:40,911 --> 00:09:41,652
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I know why, because...

106
00:09:42,492 --> 00:09:52,156
[SPEAKER_07]: Activision wants to get in the toy business because they think, hey, if we can convince stupid parents to buy these $8 pieces of crap for their kids, then we're in the money.

107
00:09:52,296 --> 00:09:54,257
[SPEAKER_07]: To be fair, it's a good idea.

108
00:09:55,318 --> 00:09:56,738
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, isn't that every Christmas?

109
00:09:57,098 --> 00:09:59,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Trying to convince parents to buy an $8 piece of crap for their kids?

110
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,380
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, pretty much.

111
00:10:02,944 --> 00:10:05,326
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a parent now, would you consider buying it?

112
00:10:05,346 --> 00:10:06,147
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I would not.

113
00:10:07,047 --> 00:10:08,228
[SPEAKER_07]: You already knew what I was going to ask.

114
00:10:08,709 --> 00:10:09,829
[SPEAKER_07]: I would not, and you know why?

115
00:10:09,889 --> 00:10:11,110
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it's not a fucking toy.

116
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:12,911
[SPEAKER_07]: A toy does something.

117
00:10:12,971 --> 00:10:16,634
[SPEAKER_07]: A toy would be something that you could play with outside of the game.

118
00:10:17,355 --> 00:10:20,437
[SPEAKER_07]: If they were action figures or something like that, like a G.I.

119
00:10:20,477 --> 00:10:25,100
[SPEAKER_07]: Joe or Ninja Turtles or whatever, they actually moved, did something, then that's fine.

120
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:28,742
[SPEAKER_07]: Then that's cool if they worked with the game and you could play with them outside of it.

121
00:10:28,843 --> 00:10:30,264
[SPEAKER_07]: I could see that worth $8, but they don't do that.

122
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:31,624
[SPEAKER_02]: Do anything!

123
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:59,630
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, I know, back in the days, there was the Green Plastic Army Men, and those were also stuck to a base, but you know what?

124
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:00,451
[SPEAKER_07]: They weren't fucking $70 either.

125
00:11:00,471 --> 00:11:00,812
[SPEAKER_07]: Or $8, right?

126
00:11:05,054 --> 00:11:05,354
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

127
00:11:05,474 --> 00:11:07,316
[SPEAKER_02]: Is he allowed to have Tron toys?

128
00:11:07,536 --> 00:11:08,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Because maybe I'll have to.

129
00:11:08,997 --> 00:11:10,118
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, he's probably too young right now.

130
00:11:10,258 --> 00:11:11,138
[SPEAKER_02]: He's young for anything.

131
00:11:11,198 --> 00:11:12,179
[SPEAKER_07]: Right now he just likes books.

132
00:11:12,659 --> 00:11:13,360
[SPEAKER_07]: He likes books.

133
00:11:14,161 --> 00:11:14,741
[SPEAKER_07]: He likes books.

134
00:11:15,421 --> 00:11:20,565
[SPEAKER_07]: We brought down out of the attic Teddy Ruxpin and Grubby.

135
00:11:21,626 --> 00:11:24,108
[SPEAKER_07]: And I actually popped in a tape last night.

136
00:11:24,128 --> 00:11:24,288
[SPEAKER_07]: Man.

137
00:11:24,648 --> 00:11:25,409
[SPEAKER_07]: It still works?

138
00:11:25,569 --> 00:11:26,250
[SPEAKER_07]: It still works.

139
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:26,710
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

140
00:11:27,331 --> 00:11:28,853
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, it's in great condition.

141
00:11:28,973 --> 00:11:29,453
[SPEAKER_07]: Holy moly.

142
00:11:29,473 --> 00:11:34,218
[SPEAKER_07]: I kept that in great condition, and we also have Grubby, and I just had to find a cable to run to.

143
00:11:35,019 --> 00:11:43,348
[SPEAKER_07]: It just needs an audio cable so they both talk, but he thought it was cool for a few minutes, and then he went and, I don't know, was trying to steal the iPod.

144
00:11:43,408 --> 00:11:46,431
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, a kid his age is supposed to have a short attention span.

145
00:11:46,471 --> 00:11:47,012
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what happens.

146
00:11:47,412 --> 00:11:53,577
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, I still, you know what, despite the fact that they sold well in Miklatov's store, I still hope it fails.

147
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:54,618
[SPEAKER_07]: Why?

148
00:11:54,919 --> 00:12:02,305
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I hate Activision and their experiments to try to capitalize on... I mean, seriously, they're trying to run this franchise into the ground.

149
00:12:02,325 --> 00:12:07,069
[SPEAKER_07]: They've already tried with a few games already, and now it's just like whoring this thing out.

150
00:12:07,389 --> 00:12:08,831
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Spyro and Friends.

151
00:12:08,931 --> 00:12:11,053
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, take Spyro out of it.

152
00:12:11,713 --> 00:12:13,494
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, seriously, just take him out of it.

153
00:12:13,514 --> 00:12:15,395
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, he's not a draw anymore to these games.

154
00:12:15,656 --> 00:12:22,400
[SPEAKER_02]: I do want to move on past this subject, but I gotta say this one other comment from ShadowNextGen in our chatroom at chat.orange.com because I gotta say this does sound pretty cool.

155
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:27,003
[SPEAKER_02]: ShadowNextGen says, Skylanders Spyro's adventure is also cross-console.

156
00:12:27,343 --> 00:12:33,487
[SPEAKER_02]: Kids who have a 360 can bring the character to their friend's house and play on the Wii version with all the progress that they had on the 360 version.

157
00:12:33,647 --> 00:12:34,768
[SPEAKER_02]: I gotta admit, that sounds kind of cool.

158
00:12:36,417 --> 00:12:37,578
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki's giving me a blank stare.

159
00:12:38,359 --> 00:12:39,140
[SPEAKER_02]: He doesn't care.

160
00:12:39,901 --> 00:12:40,382
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care.

161
00:12:40,682 --> 00:12:41,243
[SPEAKER_02]: I really don't.

162
00:12:42,645 --> 00:12:42,985
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

163
00:12:43,045 --> 00:12:43,305
[SPEAKER_02]: Fine.

164
00:12:43,746 --> 00:12:44,287
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

165
00:12:44,387 --> 00:12:49,633
[SPEAKER_02]: And Tiger Claw suggests put a tape of OLR recorded on it and watch Teddy Ruxpin talk like everyone.

166
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:55,901
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if Daddy would necessarily want Josh hearing some of the rants he does on this program.

167
00:12:56,321 --> 00:12:59,082
[SPEAKER_07]: And also, I don't fucking have a tape recorder anymore.

168
00:12:59,622 --> 00:13:00,582
[SPEAKER_07]: So how would I do that?

169
00:13:01,442 --> 00:13:06,883
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, seriously, I'd have to go to my sister's house and she has my old, like, stereo system.

170
00:13:06,923 --> 00:13:07,944
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it has a tape player.

171
00:13:07,984 --> 00:13:10,524
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure if it works anymore because that's usually the first thing to break.

172
00:13:10,804 --> 00:13:16,805
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually, I had a huge old boombox when I moved this last time that had tape recorders in it and everything.

173
00:13:16,825 --> 00:13:18,026
[SPEAKER_02]: I fucking threw it away.

174
00:13:18,046 --> 00:13:19,066
[SPEAKER_02]: Like...

175
00:13:19,546 --> 00:13:27,429
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw a great picture on Facebook earlier in the week or maybe it was last week it had a little picture of a cassette tape and a pencil and it said if you don't know what these two items have in common then you're too young

176
00:13:49,753 --> 00:13:50,394
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was funny.

177
00:13:50,994 --> 00:13:52,096
[SPEAKER_02]: It was an old people joke.

178
00:13:52,316 --> 00:13:54,439
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, moving on.

179
00:13:54,939 --> 00:13:56,181
[SPEAKER_02]: Not so lighthearted news.

180
00:13:56,201 --> 00:13:57,642
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, this is kind of sad.

181
00:13:57,682 --> 00:14:00,826
[SPEAKER_02]: And it sucks that I'm having to do a eulogy two weeks in a row.

182
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:05,031
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's just unfortunately the tech world has lost a lot of great people in the past couple weeks.

183
00:14:05,452 --> 00:14:07,174
[SPEAKER_02]: And this week we lost Dennis Ritchie.

184
00:14:08,194 --> 00:14:12,798
[SPEAKER_02]: You may not recognize the name as readily as you might say Steve Jobs, who we were talking about last week.

185
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:20,003
[SPEAKER_02]: But Dennis Ritchie obviously had a direct impact on pretty much everything in the video game world.

186
00:14:20,404 --> 00:14:20,704
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?

187
00:14:21,264 --> 00:14:25,627
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if you didn't know, he only wrote the C programming language.

188
00:14:26,928 --> 00:14:34,074
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of important because every programming language out there is just about some type of derivative.

189
00:14:36,055 --> 00:14:59,793
[SPEAKER_02]: Derivative, thank you, I don't know why the words just gave me, of C So, you know, I even learned a little bit of C++ when I was in college I actually originally studied to be a computer programmer But it wasn't really free It worked out terribly, and I actually, this is the ironic thing I actually blame my teacher I had a horrible, horrible professor And I don't think I went to a very good university either Yeah

190
00:15:00,453 --> 00:15:03,295
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and granted, there were some things going on in my personal life.

191
00:15:03,335 --> 00:15:04,476
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't scapegoat everything.

192
00:15:04,596 --> 00:15:05,697
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of it is my fault, too.

193
00:15:06,118 --> 00:15:07,439
[SPEAKER_02]: But let's be real.

194
00:15:07,479 --> 00:15:08,780
[SPEAKER_02]: Computer science was just not for me.

195
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,222
[SPEAKER_02]: Ironically, what do I end up doing now for a living?

196
00:15:11,362 --> 00:15:12,122
[SPEAKER_02]: Not this show.

197
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:13,183
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not my day job.

198
00:15:13,223 --> 00:15:13,563
[SPEAKER_02]: Trust me.

199
00:15:14,144 --> 00:15:15,505
[SPEAKER_02]: But the job I had to pay the bills.

200
00:15:15,585 --> 00:15:16,005
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a teacher.

201
00:15:17,706 --> 00:15:43,038
[SPEAKER_02]: in a corporate environment so I teach adults much like the professor did so it's just kind of ironic that that's where I ended up but anyway I don't want to get too far away from the topic at hand obviously we have to tip the hat to Dennis Ritchie who created C programming language also was a co-creator of the Unix operating system which is a huge deal he passed away this week at 70 years old causes undisclosed at this time so

202
00:15:45,038 --> 00:15:46,439
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're ready to move on to our gaming week.

203
00:15:46,459 --> 00:15:49,600
[SPEAKER_07]: I think cause was sadness from hearing that Skylanders is coming out.

204
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,220
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop it.

205
00:15:50,581 --> 00:15:51,401
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop it right now.

206
00:15:51,461 --> 00:15:51,981
[SPEAKER_02]: It's terrible.

207
00:15:52,021 --> 00:15:52,461
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't joke.

208
00:15:52,521 --> 00:15:52,841
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

209
00:15:53,182 --> 00:15:53,682
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on.

210
00:15:53,902 --> 00:15:54,802
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.

211
00:15:56,143 --> 00:15:57,163
[SPEAKER_02]: How was your gaming week?

212
00:15:57,563 --> 00:15:58,584
[SPEAKER_04]: I played stuff other than WoW.

213
00:15:59,372 --> 00:16:01,254
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, congratulations!

214
00:16:01,334 --> 00:16:03,096
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody give DarkSakura a round of applause.

215
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:08,522
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, when you came in, I was playing Castlevania Symphony of the Night because we finally got it working on the system.

216
00:16:08,542 --> 00:16:09,143
[SPEAKER_04]: You sure were.

217
00:16:10,084 --> 00:16:14,609
[SPEAKER_04]: And, of course, I was screaming because, damn it, it's not playing on the PlayStation.

218
00:16:14,889 --> 00:16:17,352
[SPEAKER_02]: And I walked in the house and I said, what is a man?

219
00:16:17,392 --> 00:16:19,374
[SPEAKER_02]: And I threw a glass on the ground and Dan got very angry.

220
00:16:19,614 --> 00:16:21,596
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, especially since it was our class.

221
00:16:21,676 --> 00:16:21,876
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

222
00:16:24,077 --> 00:16:26,399
[SPEAKER_02]: And I called him a miserable little pile of secrets.

223
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:28,040
[SPEAKER_04]: He just said, bitch, clean that up.

224
00:16:29,001 --> 00:16:29,621
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty much, yeah.

225
00:16:29,982 --> 00:16:34,025
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we also played Guardian Heroes today.

226
00:16:34,385 --> 00:16:35,205
[SPEAKER_04]: We got the demo.

227
00:16:35,826 --> 00:16:40,029
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Dan proceeded to go, wait, I want to play Radiant Silvergun and decided to play Radiant Silvergun.

228
00:16:40,069 --> 00:16:42,291
[SPEAKER_04]: And the demo was like half a level.

229
00:16:42,591 --> 00:16:43,431
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not even worth it.

230
00:16:45,232 --> 00:16:46,272
[SPEAKER_04]: Play more Grand Theft Auto.

231
00:16:46,292 --> 00:16:46,452
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um...

232
00:17:12,256 --> 00:17:13,917
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't play any Earth Defense Force this week.

233
00:17:14,377 --> 00:17:15,858
[SPEAKER_07]: More Dead Rising 2 off the record though.

234
00:17:16,058 --> 00:17:16,979
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you feeling okay?

235
00:17:17,999 --> 00:17:24,643
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I just didn't get around to playing more Earth Defense Force because I was playing Dead Rising off the record.

236
00:17:26,104 --> 00:17:26,564
[SPEAKER_07]: It's alright.

237
00:17:26,704 --> 00:17:32,027
[SPEAKER_07]: I know a lot of the complaints that other people have because I didn't really play through Dead Rising 2.

238
00:17:33,148 --> 00:17:35,389
[SPEAKER_07]: Playing through sandbox mode is kind of relaxing actually.

239
00:17:36,469 --> 00:17:40,332
[SPEAKER_07]: Although I still don't understand why zombies are easily killed by guns.

240
00:17:41,618 --> 00:17:42,638
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

241
00:18:12,543 --> 00:18:13,584
[SPEAKER_07]: That doesn't make any sense to me.

242
00:18:14,664 --> 00:18:17,146
[SPEAKER_07]: Out of all the games, I mean, completely unrealistic whatsoever.

243
00:18:19,787 --> 00:18:20,287
[SPEAKER_07]: I just don't get it.

244
00:18:20,507 --> 00:18:23,409
[SPEAKER_07]: Why are the crazies, you know, more armored than zombies?

245
00:18:24,329 --> 00:18:27,531
[SPEAKER_07]: I think, granted, the zombies are dead already, but... I mean, shit.

246
00:18:28,152 --> 00:18:29,893
[SPEAKER_07]: It should only take a couple of shotgun rounds.

247
00:18:30,073 --> 00:18:35,756
[SPEAKER_07]: And I understand you want to make it difficult because they're, like, boss characters or whatever, but... I don't know.

248
00:18:35,816 --> 00:18:37,917
[SPEAKER_07]: Just put more of them on the screen or something.

249
00:18:39,133 --> 00:18:39,654
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a fun game.

250
00:18:40,937 --> 00:18:42,880
[SPEAKER_07]: My character is currently dressed up like a cowboy now.

251
00:18:44,744 --> 00:18:47,209
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm still going through every single piece of clothing I find.

252
00:18:47,249 --> 00:18:47,670
[SPEAKER_07]: I pick it up.

253
00:18:48,542 --> 00:18:51,903
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this the game that has the Proto Man costume I was reading about this week too?

254
00:18:51,923 --> 00:18:52,024
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

255
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:52,904
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.

256
00:18:54,004 --> 00:18:55,365
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though Capcom hates Mega Man.

257
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:57,606
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why it's Proto Man, not Mega Man.

258
00:18:58,746 --> 00:18:59,647
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, touche.

259
00:19:01,127 --> 00:19:06,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well if that's it for your gaming week, my gaming week was a lot of games you would not be expecting me to play.

260
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:16,694
[SPEAKER_02]: I played a demo, and you know, I hate basing my assumptions of games off the demo, but let's be real, it's what a lot of us are doing in this day and age of digital download.

261
00:19:17,534 --> 00:19:21,575
[SPEAKER_02]: And I downloaded the demo for a game I was interested in at first because I love this series.

262
00:19:21,815 --> 00:19:23,856
[SPEAKER_02]: Burnout Crash is the game I downloaded.

263
00:19:24,656 --> 00:19:26,116
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like Burnout an awful lot.

264
00:19:26,156 --> 00:19:27,637
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole series is really fun.

265
00:19:28,437 --> 00:19:33,518
[SPEAKER_02]: And the crash mode in, what was it, Burnout Takedown 3 or whatever?

266
00:19:33,979 --> 00:19:34,699
[SPEAKER_02]: That was fun.

267
00:19:34,759 --> 00:19:35,439
[SPEAKER_02]: It's awesome.

268
00:19:35,499 --> 00:19:38,680
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I heard they were making a whole game based around that mode, I was really excited.

269
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:44,802
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I downloaded the demo, I played it, and it was like the most uninteresting game I think I've played in a very long time.

270
00:19:44,922 --> 00:19:46,122
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I'm sorry to say, like...

271
00:19:46,642 --> 00:19:47,663
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

272
00:20:03,918 --> 00:20:11,063
[SPEAKER_02]: And for those that haven't played Burnout or know what the crash mode is, basically it's all about creating these huge explosions.

273
00:20:11,623 --> 00:20:14,265
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can press a button to blow up your car, essentially.

274
00:20:14,866 --> 00:20:17,587
[SPEAKER_02]: And as you fill up a meter, you can blow up your car again and again.

275
00:20:17,607 --> 00:20:20,329
[SPEAKER_02]: You're causing these big chain reactions and pileups.

276
00:20:20,389 --> 00:20:26,553
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that sounds really exciting, but in a 2D Xbox Live Arcade title, it was really boring.

277
00:20:27,794 --> 00:20:29,235
[SPEAKER_02]: I was so not interested in the game.

278
00:20:29,295 --> 00:20:30,996
[SPEAKER_02]: And I tried.

279
00:20:31,016 --> 00:20:33,158
[SPEAKER_02]: I played through the whole first little demo and everything.

280
00:20:34,279 --> 00:20:35,740
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to drop $15 on this.

281
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:36,080
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

282
00:20:37,261 --> 00:20:38,062
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, Burnout.

283
00:20:38,702 --> 00:20:40,203
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a fan of the Crash Arcade.

284
00:20:40,444 --> 00:20:40,744
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

285
00:20:41,044 --> 00:20:47,549
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love to play a game that was like actual racing Crash mode, though, because that was a lot of fun in Burnout 3.

286
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:51,493
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can see where maybe somebody thought on paper it was a good idea, but it's not.

287
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:52,594
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

288
00:20:53,414 --> 00:21:01,318
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I also played NBA Jam on Fire Edition, which, um, you know what I miss about the original NBA Jam?

289
00:21:01,398 --> 00:21:03,079
[SPEAKER_02]: The fact that it only had three buttons.

290
00:21:03,499 --> 00:21:09,322
[SPEAKER_02]: And, I don't know, like, I tried to play this new NBA Jam, and I was just like, my characters were not doing anything I wanted them to do.

291
00:21:09,943 --> 00:21:14,925
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, granted, I, you do not associate me with sports games titles often.

292
00:21:14,985 --> 00:21:16,486
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not really an expert on them.

293
00:21:16,826 --> 00:21:22,249
[SPEAKER_02]: But there are a few sports game titles I do enjoy, and most of them have to do from when I was younger, and you know, and so forth.

294
00:21:22,269 --> 00:21:22,309
[SPEAKER_02]: Um,

295
00:21:22,589 --> 00:21:23,030
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

296
00:21:37,911 --> 00:21:38,531
[SPEAKER_02]: Final Fantasy XIV

297
00:22:08,638 --> 00:22:19,105
[SPEAKER_02]: After the phone call last week, Miklatov pestered me and pestered me and finally I decided to buy the game on Amazon because I found it for like 25 bucks new because it's pretty easy to find right now.

298
00:22:19,905 --> 00:22:21,706
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got the game.

299
00:22:22,687 --> 00:22:24,228
[SPEAKER_02]: It took me a while to install.

300
00:22:24,448 --> 00:22:29,912
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the first thing that pissed me off about it because my DVD was borked or something where my drive wouldn't even read it.

301
00:22:30,252 --> 00:22:37,337
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to dump all the files to Alan's computer because his drive could read it, transfer it to my USB drive, then install it off the USB drive.

302
00:22:37,797 --> 00:22:38,557
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

303
00:22:55,504 --> 00:22:58,906
[SPEAKER_02]: The question I think that's on everybody's mind now is, is the game any better now?

304
00:22:59,426 --> 00:23:01,347
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would say the answer is yes, actually.

305
00:23:01,387 --> 00:23:02,988
[SPEAKER_02]: The game is a lot better now.

306
00:23:03,408 --> 00:23:06,690
[SPEAKER_02]: The combat mode makes a lot more sense.

307
00:23:07,971 --> 00:23:10,953
[SPEAKER_02]: The game itself, graphically, is really good looking.

308
00:23:11,873 --> 00:23:12,894
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

309
00:23:29,444 --> 00:23:40,392
[SPEAKER_02]: and I think they've tried to improve the tutorial a little bit because I sense that there's been some things added with that but there's still a lot of what the hell do I do now going on in that game.

310
00:23:40,512 --> 00:23:53,782
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't really quite handhold you the way that WoW does for the first few levels and I had to take a lot on myself to go research wikis and fan sites devoted to the game to figure out like how do I get better armor and

311
00:23:55,669 --> 00:24:14,662
[SPEAKER_02]: or where is the damn auction house you know like these are things that the game doesn't really help you with and I realize that a lot of people that are going to defend Final Fantasy XI and Final Fantasy XIV are going to say well that's just that's part of the game these games are not wow you're supposed to figure these things out that's the challenge and I'm here to tell you most people aren't going to fucking have the patience for that

312
00:24:15,582 --> 00:24:22,947
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that's fine if, you know, the select elite smart few want to, you know, go ahead and be all into it or whatever.

313
00:24:23,047 --> 00:24:27,810
[SPEAKER_02]: But without a significant amount of people supporting the MMO, the MMO is not really going to last.

314
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:34,274
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I definitely notice there's a lot less people playing this game than there was Final Fantasy XI when I was playing it.

315
00:24:34,314 --> 00:24:35,735
[SPEAKER_02]: I noticed that right off the bat too.

316
00:24:36,175 --> 00:24:38,897
[SPEAKER_02]: The server seems a lot more empty than XI.

317
00:24:40,001 --> 00:24:41,942
[SPEAKER_02]: To the game's credit, again, it's gorgeous.

318
00:24:42,242 --> 00:24:43,462
[SPEAKER_02]: The battle system's interesting.

319
00:24:44,082 --> 00:24:48,824
[SPEAKER_02]: I really like how they've handled the mixture of jobs now.

320
00:24:49,824 --> 00:24:59,088
[SPEAKER_02]: If you level one class like a Conjurer and then you level another class like a Thermiturge, you can take the spells you've learned as a Thermiturge and apply it to when you're a Conjurer.

321
00:24:59,868 --> 00:25:05,350
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything is like your own custom class that you've built of spells and abilities mixed together from the other classes.

322
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:06,090
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.

323
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:07,170
[SPEAKER_02]: There are things I do like

324
00:25:09,511 --> 00:25:10,071
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

325
00:25:33,783 --> 00:26:02,159
[SPEAKER_02]: the guild levs or the little questing thing that they put into it you really can do a lot with a very limited amount of time like I have noticed you can get in there do some levs and you know you've gained some experience and you feel like you've done something for the day and that's kind of nice like that's something Eleven never really had is that you had to sit around find a party okay maybe we'll gain some experience unless you were a white mage hopefully somebody does I mean you know even as white mage he's a white mage yeah sometimes you'd struggle a little bit

326
00:26:02,779 --> 00:26:20,142
[SPEAKER_02]: but the nice thing is there are things you can do by yourself and the things that they've done especially with the crafting the whole fact that crafting is its own job system with its own quests even I thought I was going to really hate that at first but I realize it gives you so much to do playing alone

327
00:26:20,743 --> 00:26:23,405
[SPEAKER_02]: that XI never really had, at least back in its heyday.

328
00:26:23,425 --> 00:26:27,948
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep in mind, my frame of reference for Final Fantasy XI is up until about Treasures of Argon.

329
00:26:27,988 --> 00:26:29,989
[SPEAKER_02]: I never played after the Wings of the Goddess.

330
00:26:30,249 --> 00:26:34,052
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I played a little bit of that expansion, but never the Abyssia or any of this stuff.

331
00:26:34,072 --> 00:26:36,734
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, level syncing, I was already gone by the time that came out.

332
00:26:36,774 --> 00:26:39,696
[SPEAKER_02]: So keep in mind, my frame of reference is a few years dated in the game.

333
00:26:40,456 --> 00:26:46,103
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, now here's the other thing, and I know you guys are probably waiting for me to mention this, because there's been a lot of talk about this this week.

334
00:26:46,583 --> 00:26:54,773
[SPEAKER_02]: Final Fantasy XIV had a lot of major announcements to it this week, one of them being, of course, the day the game shows up in the mail for me, what's the big announcement?

335
00:26:55,073 --> 00:26:57,215
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna start charging monthly for this game.

336
00:26:57,235 --> 00:26:57,275
[SPEAKER_02]: Ha!

337
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:00,420
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

338
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:03,802
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they were previewing a lot of what they plan to do in 2.0.

339
00:27:04,162 --> 00:27:06,083
[SPEAKER_02]: And granted, a lot of it sounds really cool.

340
00:27:06,323 --> 00:27:09,084
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks sexy as far as... The screenshots look great.

341
00:27:09,344 --> 00:27:13,686
[SPEAKER_02]: They're incorporating the old school Final Fantasy more into it, which I think is great.

342
00:27:13,826 --> 00:27:17,268
[SPEAKER_02]: I really like what they've got planned out for Final Fantasy 14 2.0.

343
00:27:18,308 --> 00:27:23,571
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be very interesting and almost something unprecedented in gaming where can this game be rescued?

344
00:27:24,291 --> 00:27:47,091
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's going to be really interesting to see if they're successful or not but the fact that they're going to start charging people when the game is admittedly halfway done is a little weird to me and I'm going to be honest right now at this moment in my point of mind if they were to start charging for this game tomorrow probably not going to pay for it I'll enjoy my 30 day trial period and then be done with it I got a lot going on in Warcraft and other MMOs that I play

345
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:50,652
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not even going to be done until what, 2013?

346
00:27:51,312 --> 00:27:54,513
[SPEAKER_02]: The end of 2012, I think, is when the big, big expansion is supposed to hit.

347
00:27:54,553 --> 00:27:55,413
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, 2013.

348
00:27:55,473 --> 00:27:57,113
[SPEAKER_02]: But here's the other thing, too.

349
00:27:57,133 --> 00:28:00,534
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to remember Final Fantasy XI, it didn't come out in America at first.

350
00:28:00,554 --> 00:28:01,454
[SPEAKER_02]: It was only out in Japan.

351
00:28:01,474 --> 00:28:09,636
[SPEAKER_02]: And when it came out in America, we essentially got Final Fantasy XI 2.0 because we had Rise of the Ziller included with our release when it came out.

352
00:28:09,696 --> 00:28:11,337
[SPEAKER_02]: So it gave them time to work out the kinks.

353
00:28:11,937 --> 00:28:19,342
[SPEAKER_02]: But now that that didn't happen this time and everything was kind of released at once, it does make me feel like I'm still playing this big alpha or beta test of a game that's not done.

354
00:28:19,603 --> 00:28:20,844
[SPEAKER_02]: And now they want to charge me for it?

355
00:28:21,224 --> 00:28:27,869
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I realize they're trying to recoup on some massive losses on this game, but... Not my problem.

356
00:28:28,669 --> 00:28:30,330
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of think they're in for a rude awakening.

357
00:28:31,131 --> 00:28:31,411
[SPEAKER_02]: Like...

358
00:28:33,593 --> 00:28:40,817
[SPEAKER_02]: The amount of failure of this game is just... Epic?

359
00:28:41,237 --> 00:28:43,879
[SPEAKER_02]: It is epic fail in every sense of the term.

360
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,002
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I think it's going to be really neat if the game can salvage itself.

361
00:28:48,082 --> 00:28:56,387
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got to be honest, a lot of what I'm seeing online and a lot of this plan... And I like that now they're being open with their customer base.

362
00:28:56,827 --> 00:29:18,831
[SPEAKER_02]: now they're talking more now they're laying out a plan like I think they realize they've fucked up in a big big way I mean for the president of Square Enix to say this game tarnished the Final Fantasy brand one of the biggest and longest running franchises in gaming history that is like not something to just blink at that's huge especially a Japanese company to say that

363
00:29:21,966 --> 00:29:49,298
[SPEAKER_02]: so but I think if the game kind of keeps moving on this path I mean it's definitely gone in the right direction I listened real quick sorry I listened I went back and listened to how I first described my Final Fantasy 14 experience and I called it fucking garbage that was exactly how I reviewed this game when I played the beta it is no longer fucking garbage but it's not a amazing game that I want to pay money to play every month it's pretty good

364
00:29:50,236 --> 00:29:50,596
[SPEAKER_02]: It's alright.

365
00:29:51,057 --> 00:29:51,637
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on its way.

366
00:29:51,977 --> 00:29:52,538
[SPEAKER_02]: It's getting better.

367
00:29:53,038 --> 00:30:03,625
[SPEAKER_07]: But see, what's the point if, like, why would I start paying for this game when they're like, oh, it's not really gonna be done until next November or, you know, the end of next year.

368
00:30:04,205 --> 00:30:04,866
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, well, fine.

369
00:30:04,946 --> 00:30:06,847
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not gonna pay for it until the end of next year.

370
00:30:06,967 --> 00:30:07,808
[SPEAKER_07]: That's when I'll pick it up.

371
00:30:08,268 --> 00:30:10,570
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, why even announce that and then start charging?

372
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:13,051
[SPEAKER_07]: All you're gonna do is just get people to quit.

373
00:30:13,772 --> 00:30:15,353
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you may get a few people that are diehard.

374
00:30:15,393 --> 00:30:19,976
[SPEAKER_07]: They're just gonna, I'm gonna level up my characters while we're doing this and stuff, you know, while you're working on it.

375
00:30:20,456 --> 00:30:46,386
[SPEAKER_07]: but I think a lot of people that were just like oh well it's free right now I'm just not gonna pay for it but now that they're gonna start charging I'll just wait and play something else and then I'll come back to it you know in a year or so but at that time who the hell knows what like Blizzard's gonna have at that time or I mean fuck how many more MMOs are gonna come about by the time that they're ready to launch 2.0 it's not gonna matter and a really good one's going free to play

376
00:30:46,926 --> 00:30:51,970
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got Swarder on the horizon at the end of December.

377
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:56,453
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got Guild Wars 2 next year that has a lot of people really riled up.

378
00:30:56,753 --> 00:30:58,134
[SPEAKER_02]: There will be a WoW expansion.

379
00:30:58,274 --> 00:31:01,436
[SPEAKER_02]: By that point, Blizzard will have announced their next MMO.

380
00:31:03,097 --> 00:31:03,678
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you're right.

381
00:31:03,818 --> 00:31:05,059
[SPEAKER_02]: It's getting a little crowded in the MMO space.

382
00:31:05,099 --> 00:31:07,500
[SPEAKER_07]: I think what's going to end up happening is it's just going to go free-to-play.

383
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,081
[SPEAKER_07]: It's got to.

384
00:31:08,141 --> 00:31:12,664
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that's the trend right now, and a lot of these suffering MMOs end up going that way.

385
00:31:12,924 --> 00:31:18,090
[SPEAKER_07]: But then again, they're Square Enix and they're fucking stubborn, so they may just let it rot and die.

386
00:31:19,933 --> 00:31:25,720
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love to read a behind-the-scenes book on Final Fantasy XIV.

387
00:31:26,401 --> 00:31:29,084
[SPEAKER_02]: For better or for worse, this is a game that will go down in history.

388
00:31:29,785 --> 00:31:30,345
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

389
00:31:31,026 --> 00:31:31,487
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

390
00:31:31,786 --> 00:31:33,106
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're watching it unfold right now

391
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:04,470
[SPEAKER_02]: We won this award the very, very first year, which was 2005, and DarkSakura now has her Duffy hat sitting on the trophy.

392
00:32:04,610 --> 00:32:05,050
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I do.

393
00:32:06,292 --> 00:32:06,853
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll take a picture.

394
00:32:06,993 --> 00:32:09,556
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, we've got that, and we would...

395
00:32:10,537 --> 00:32:11,919
[SPEAKER_02]: and be honored to win it again.

396
00:32:12,119 --> 00:32:18,705
[SPEAKER_02]: But there are a lot of great shows in the finals, but the promotion that we could get for winning would be great.

397
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:23,689
[SPEAKER_02]: And as you know, we don't have a lot of big dollars or ways to advertise our program.

398
00:32:23,709 --> 00:32:24,630
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't have any big dollars.

399
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:26,252
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, actually we have no money whatsoever.

400
00:32:26,332 --> 00:32:29,034
[SPEAKER_02]: So we really rely on word of mouth as we say at the end of every show.

401
00:32:29,074 --> 00:32:29,515
[SPEAKER_02]: So please...

402
00:32:30,075 --> 00:32:30,916
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

403
00:32:52,159 --> 00:33:07,548
[SPEAKER_02]: but um yeah we would be honored to win again and it would be pretty cool I think we would be the only show to have won the award like what six years apart but you know it it's been an honor just to be nominated all right that being said we fucking want to win

404
00:33:08,488 --> 00:33:36,603
[SPEAKER_02]: and also on Facebook you can check out we've got a little banner art thing that you can put in your signature on whatever forums you happen to visit and stuff to help promote voting don't spam people but at the same time please people you know tell them we really do need every vote because every show and you probably have a couple of the podcasts that are finalists in your listening rotation as you should there's a lot of great shows that were nominated

405
00:33:37,664 --> 00:33:54,587
[SPEAKER_02]: and you're probably going to be hearing this to death throughout the next couple weeks but you know it's really promotion from winning it can't be beat so it'd be great alright let's move on and talk about the gaming news so Loki why don't you start us off

406
00:33:55,246 --> 00:34:04,252
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, you know there's a new fall dashboard update coming to the Xbox 360 to kind of make it look a little bit like Windows 8 or the Windows Phone and that kind of stuff.

407
00:34:04,532 --> 00:34:06,593
[SPEAKER_07]: Personally, I think it looks stupid, but whatever.

408
00:34:07,794 --> 00:34:08,635
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't really have a say in it.

409
00:34:08,655 --> 00:34:12,237
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got to update on the 25th of November when this actually goes live.

410
00:34:13,318 --> 00:34:19,081
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently, it's going to be using a modified version of Silverlight, if you care to know how it works.

411
00:34:19,802 --> 00:34:24,505
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, I don't really care myself, but it's supposed to do a lot of integration.

412
00:34:24,585 --> 00:34:29,709
[SPEAKER_07]: Obviously, they're going to have more Kinect support and the live TV stuff.

413
00:34:29,909 --> 00:34:38,855
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, you're going to be able to do the Bing searches and all sorts of stuff to find different content on there.

414
00:34:39,675 --> 00:35:07,268
[SPEAKER_07]: and I believe there is also a if you wanted to I decided to opt out of it this year a beta participation to test the dashboard early honestly wasn't a big fan of having to update twice a day every single day until the launch of the actual dashboard so I passed on that but that was available shortly and I believe the submission for the beta program has been closed already and

415
00:35:08,709 --> 00:35:13,147
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and of course, for those keeping track, 25th also is Black Friday.

416
00:35:17,195 --> 00:35:19,376
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my gosh, that's rolling out on Black Friday?

417
00:35:19,896 --> 00:35:20,116
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

418
00:35:20,276 --> 00:35:21,657
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a recipe for disaster.

419
00:35:23,277 --> 00:35:23,557
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe.

420
00:35:23,597 --> 00:35:25,218
[SPEAKER_02]: That sucks for those employees.

421
00:35:25,318 --> 00:35:29,099
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you know Microsoft's got to be fully staffed for a day that something like that goes live.

422
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,260
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't have to work on Black Friday.

423
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:34,321
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they will at least have their stomach full of turkey.

424
00:35:34,761 --> 00:35:38,182
[SPEAKER_07]: And they will be ready to take those.

425
00:35:38,202 --> 00:35:39,743
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki always looking at the bright side.

426
00:35:39,983 --> 00:35:40,263
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

427
00:35:41,024 --> 00:35:54,860
[SPEAKER_02]: you know what an awesome thing to do is on Black Friday go to a theme park because they're empty I don't know about Disneyland Disneyland's always kind of the exception to the rule but I will say like I went to Magic Mountain a couple years ago it was empty on Black Friday Black Friday and Super Bowl Sunday best days to do that stuff

428
00:35:56,246 --> 00:35:59,810
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, as far as the fall dashboard goes, are you excited for this?

429
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:00,690
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

430
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:00,971
[SPEAKER_02]: No?

431
00:36:01,411 --> 00:36:02,412
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I hate the way it looks.

432
00:36:02,672 --> 00:36:03,233
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't like it?

433
00:36:03,473 --> 00:36:04,754
[SPEAKER_07]: I dislike it.

434
00:36:05,115 --> 00:36:10,260
[SPEAKER_07]: Windows 8, you know what, when that comes out, I am fucking turning this shit off so it looks like back to Windows 7.

435
00:36:13,523 --> 00:36:28,964
[SPEAKER_07]: 95 XP whatever you want to call it you know I don't like this crappy oh look at all these panes of information yeah you know panes of information are it's more advertising space that's all this fucking is and I don't care about the ads that are on there already so why would I want to see more of them

436
00:36:29,324 --> 00:36:30,025
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

437
00:36:50,422 --> 00:37:12,968
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope I can yell that at my connect and it'll understand me because like honestly part of the NXE and part of the frustrating stuff in that is that you sometimes like honestly can't find the one simple thing you're trying to change in your settings because they're like all over the place so hopefully this has that a little more streamlined but as far as like being like a streamlined entertainment box well shit that's where they're all going now anyway

438
00:37:13,308 --> 00:37:31,373
[SPEAKER_07]: and I think the next generation of consoles just you wait how streamlined those things are going to be with your other entertainment stuff I'm cool with the fact that they're going to have content on there and I would like to believe that it's going to be free but I don't like the fact that it's tied in with my cable provider because

439
00:37:32,353 --> 00:37:36,817
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, granted, right now with Comcast, I have the most basic, basic, basic cable possible.

440
00:37:36,837 --> 00:37:39,240
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think I even have on-demand or anything like that.

441
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:46,346
[SPEAKER_07]: But I don't want to have to have Comcast cable in order to access... I mean, I would love to get rid of cable, period.

442
00:37:46,627 --> 00:37:47,668
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep the internet, of course.

443
00:37:48,448 --> 00:37:50,851
[SPEAKER_07]: And just have access to this stuff.

444
00:37:50,911 --> 00:37:53,233
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe not necessarily the stuff that's on Comcast.

445
00:37:53,253 --> 00:37:55,815
[SPEAKER_07]: Because if I want to watch on-demand Comcast stuff...

446
00:37:56,716 --> 00:37:59,783
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll just go to Comcast and watch on demand.

447
00:38:00,084 --> 00:38:01,828
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a ton of different ways to do that.

448
00:38:02,149 --> 00:38:05,377
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't need to actually hook up my console to do the same thing I do on my TV.

449
00:38:05,697 --> 00:38:06,700
[SPEAKER_07]: It just doesn't make any sense.

450
00:38:09,082 --> 00:38:14,504
[SPEAKER_02]: I've actually really given thought to just cutting my cable loose because I just, I barely watch any TV.

451
00:38:14,524 --> 00:38:16,905
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, ours is linked to our internet, so.

452
00:38:17,005 --> 00:38:21,347
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, so is ours, but I mean, still, if we could even save 20 bucks a month shutting it off.

453
00:38:21,367 --> 00:38:25,509
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's the thing, though, is as we did that, we cut out phone and we also cut out cable.

454
00:38:26,269 --> 00:38:32,231
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we were going to cut out cable and just keep the internet, but they had a plan that was $2 more for cable included.

455
00:38:32,251 --> 00:38:33,972
[SPEAKER_07]: So I was like, okay, fine, we'll do cable too.

456
00:38:34,392 --> 00:38:38,053
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a good thing, too, because my plan was, oh, I'm just going to get one of those antennas and hook it up.

457
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:39,693
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I bought one of those antennas last night.

458
00:38:39,833 --> 00:38:40,673
[SPEAKER_07]: They fucking suck.

459
00:38:41,054 --> 00:38:42,474
[SPEAKER_07]: They do not tune in shit.

460
00:38:42,754 --> 00:38:43,734
[SPEAKER_07]: So I got nothing.

461
00:38:43,754 --> 00:38:47,215
[SPEAKER_07]: And the only time I did get to tune in a channel, it was so messed up.

462
00:38:47,235 --> 00:38:50,876
[SPEAKER_02]: When you have cable internet, you kind of have to have at least basic cable, right?

463
00:38:50,916 --> 00:38:52,756
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I don't think any of the companies will sell you.

464
00:38:52,816 --> 00:38:55,137
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you can get just the internet.

465
00:38:55,217 --> 00:38:55,537
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

466
00:38:55,697 --> 00:39:00,958
[SPEAKER_02]: I always thought you had to have at least... It's more expensive, but... Like local channels plus CNN, bare minimum.

467
00:39:01,358 --> 00:39:09,668
[SPEAKER_07]: No, you don't have to, but like I said, there's a deal that they have right now, and you can get it for, I think, they gave it to us for about $2 more a month.

468
00:39:10,248 --> 00:39:12,091
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was like, you know what, I can do that.

469
00:39:12,491 --> 00:39:18,177
[SPEAKER_07]: And since Comcast doesn't have any contracts, it's like, well, fuck, at the end of the year, just cancel.

470
00:39:18,418 --> 00:39:21,782
[SPEAKER_07]: Or end of one year's time, we can just cancel.

471
00:39:21,822 --> 00:39:22,002
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

472
00:39:22,222 --> 00:39:22,462
[SPEAKER_02]: Who cares?

473
00:39:22,482 --> 00:39:23,843
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think that's exactly what's happening.

474
00:39:23,864 --> 00:39:25,045
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure these companies know.

475
00:39:25,065 --> 00:39:29,128
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, all they're doing is just raising the prices of... You watch, they're going to start raising the prices of a lot of internet...

476
00:39:42,099 --> 00:39:50,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well let's move on to some other gaming related stories, and speaking of rising prices, these next little few stories have to do with the online pass.

477
00:39:50,682 --> 00:39:58,065
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that's right, what once was Project $10 is now becoming the standard, and if you don't believe me, look at what they're doing in some big releases coming out.

478
00:39:58,985 --> 00:40:04,407
[SPEAKER_02]: Catwoman in Batman Arkham City, obviously this is a huge release that's out, what, this week?

479
00:40:04,487 --> 00:40:05,408
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this week Arkham City?

480
00:40:05,688 --> 00:40:05,988
[SPEAKER_02]: Tuesday.

481
00:40:06,688 --> 00:40:07,949
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually on my friend's birthday.

482
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:08,690
[SPEAKER_02]: Big week.

483
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:11,693
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Arkham City is coming out and here's the deal.

484
00:40:11,733 --> 00:40:15,276
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to play as Catwoman, you need to have an online pass.

485
00:40:16,077 --> 00:40:18,839
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them will come with the game, of course, and you buy it new.

486
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:22,002
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the whole deal is that you always do get it included new.

487
00:40:22,362 --> 00:40:30,750
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you end up buying the game used, you will have to purchase the VIP pass for 800 Microsoft points or $9.99 on PlayStation Network.

488
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:32,812
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, $10 or however you slice it there.

489
00:40:33,512 --> 00:40:38,273
[SPEAKER_02]: They are quick to say that playing as Catwoman is not required to complete the game.

490
00:40:38,813 --> 00:40:41,514
[SPEAKER_02]: But come on, we all want to see Catwoman in that outfit.

491
00:40:41,534 --> 00:40:42,514
[SPEAKER_02]: Not entirely true.

492
00:40:43,034 --> 00:40:44,215
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there's more.

493
00:40:44,295 --> 00:40:45,055
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on, hold on.

494
00:40:45,435 --> 00:40:51,817
[SPEAKER_02]: There is something else going on there too, and that is a deal with a company called the Evil Cheat.

495
00:40:53,317 --> 00:40:53,858
[SPEAKER_02]: Evil G Evil G Evil G

496
00:41:12,834 --> 00:41:24,325
[SPEAKER_02]: So in other words, Project $10 won't apply if you buy the game used at this one retailer who has their hand firmly on the balls of all gaming publishers around the world.

497
00:41:24,345 --> 00:41:32,412
[SPEAKER_07]: I bet you're going to see a lot more titles because they have the strength and buying power to say, listen, bitches, you're going to fucking give us codes for all these games.

498
00:41:32,913 --> 00:41:34,134
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's how they're going to get around it.

499
00:41:36,016 --> 00:41:36,556
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's that hurt?

500
00:41:36,736 --> 00:41:37,317
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody else.

501
00:41:38,949 --> 00:41:59,954
[SPEAKER_07]: or gross or gross if you're like me who gives a fuck about Catwoman but here's the gross part about it it's already on the goddamn disc it's just locked away behind a code because they're assholes is what it is so you know what fuck them don't buy the game or don't either don't buy the game or just don't fucking play as Catwoman who gives a shit

502
00:42:00,225 --> 00:42:04,527
[SPEAKER_02]: TigerClaw in the chatroom points out there are Riddler trophies that you can only get with Catwoman.

503
00:42:04,567 --> 00:42:06,208
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly, that was the part I was going to bring up.

504
00:42:07,228 --> 00:42:10,970
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so if you want 100% complete, you gotta play as Catwoman.

505
00:42:11,470 --> 00:42:14,571
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but granted, if you buy the game new, you're not losing any of this.

506
00:42:14,991 --> 00:42:16,012
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not going to lose it.

507
00:42:16,152 --> 00:42:16,732
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that, but...

508
00:42:17,335 --> 00:42:20,617
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, this is just that trend.

509
00:42:20,677 --> 00:42:28,680
[SPEAKER_02]: And by the way, speaking of trend, Electronic Arts mentioned this week that Battlefield 3 will also have an online pass.

510
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:31,882
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Battlefield 3, kind of a big game coming out pretty soon.

511
00:42:32,522 --> 00:42:34,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a little title you might have heard of it.

512
00:42:34,323 --> 00:42:35,324
[SPEAKER_02]: Battlefield 3, right?

513
00:42:35,724 --> 00:42:37,565
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was all confirmed on Twitter.

514
00:42:39,246 --> 00:42:45,352
[SPEAKER_02]: A user tweeted a guy working for EA, do you need to buy a new Battlefield 3 to play on Xbox Live?

515
00:42:45,613 --> 00:42:49,236
[SPEAKER_02]: And the response was, you can purchase an online pass for a used copy.

516
00:42:49,677 --> 00:42:53,140
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, as if it wasn't confirmed that this shit is now the norm.

517
00:42:53,341 --> 00:42:56,544
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's the first game that they've done that's not a sports game either.

518
00:42:57,214 --> 00:42:59,235
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I did not pick up on that.

519
00:43:00,396 --> 00:43:04,097
[SPEAKER_02]: And obviously going to be a huge, huge title no matter how you slice it.

520
00:43:04,117 --> 00:43:05,158
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm not surprised.

521
00:43:05,278 --> 00:43:09,860
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that mainly is just to stop piracy because it's going to be a big game that's going to be pirated.

522
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:16,724
[SPEAKER_02]: And to be fair, for what it's worth, this is also going to be a big title because you're going to have tons of people who buy it new.

523
00:43:17,164 --> 00:43:19,685
[SPEAKER_02]: And this will all be transparent to them.

524
00:43:19,705 --> 00:43:20,185
[SPEAKER_02]: It won't matter.

525
00:43:20,205 --> 00:43:21,206
[SPEAKER_02]: They get the code with the game.

526
00:43:22,714 --> 00:43:27,822
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's only for those people that are waiting to save a few bucks by buying a used copy that won't really be saving any money at all.

527
00:43:27,842 --> 00:43:34,613
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, just wait a little longer and I'm sure by then GameStop will have the code for you for free, you know, because they've worked out some sort of deal.

528
00:43:38,686 --> 00:43:52,724
[SPEAKER_07]: ShadowNextGen in chat says buy a game new and support the industry if you do that the online passcodes are not an issue I'm sorry once again okay yeah I understand buying new and stuff it supports the industry and stuff and I hear people saying well if you buy used the developer doesn't get any money

529
00:43:53,405 --> 00:43:55,709
[SPEAKER_07]: Listen, you stupid idiots, okay?

530
00:43:56,029 --> 00:43:59,014
[SPEAKER_07]: The developer gets paid when they fucking press a goddamn disc.

531
00:43:59,234 --> 00:44:06,345
[SPEAKER_07]: It can sit on a goddamn warehouse shelf in EA, Activision, you name it, and the developer's still getting fucking paid for that shit.

532
00:44:06,666 --> 00:44:08,429
[SPEAKER_07]: So the fact that they're complaining that...

533
00:44:09,610 --> 00:44:11,931
[SPEAKER_07]: We didn't sell another new copy.

534
00:44:12,271 --> 00:44:15,473
[SPEAKER_07]: Now our servers are going to go down because we have less people paying for it.

535
00:44:15,713 --> 00:44:16,293
[SPEAKER_07]: No, listen.

536
00:44:16,673 --> 00:44:21,096
[SPEAKER_07]: There's exactly the same amount of people playing on those goddamn servers as new copies that were sold.

537
00:44:21,336 --> 00:44:25,758
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't magically create two copies out of one without some sort of piracy.

538
00:44:26,519 --> 00:44:30,121
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we all agree that piracy is a no-no.

539
00:44:30,461 --> 00:44:33,102
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, piracy is bad, but that is really the only thing.

540
00:44:33,303 --> 00:44:33,763
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

541
00:44:33,963 --> 00:44:35,384
[SPEAKER_07]: Used games do not eat into that.

542
00:44:35,424 --> 00:44:35,584
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

543
00:44:37,245 --> 00:44:38,546
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just so stupid.

544
00:44:39,787 --> 00:44:40,587
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm with you and I'm not.

545
00:44:41,508 --> 00:44:43,790
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's my whole thing, and again, it's the movie industry.

546
00:44:43,910 --> 00:44:46,231
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think what's good enough for the movie industry is good enough for gaming.

547
00:44:46,291 --> 00:44:49,153
[SPEAKER_02]: And the movie industry hasn't died because of used games.

548
00:44:50,194 --> 00:44:52,976
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's always going to be game rental services and things like this.

549
00:44:53,476 --> 00:44:57,499
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's enough people that want these games new the day they come out.

550
00:44:57,879 --> 00:44:58,419
[SPEAKER_07]: I pre-ordered Skyrim

551
00:45:15,829 --> 00:45:26,197
[SPEAKER_07]: And now, through exclusive deals, in order to get the product into those machines, even though a lot of them are really terrible deals, they have to destroy all that product because they're afraid of the used sales eating into their new sales.

552
00:45:26,217 --> 00:45:28,678
[SPEAKER_04]: And the same thing actually happened with the original runs of Hummers.

553
00:45:29,259 --> 00:45:36,964
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like... No, seriously, not the Hummers, but the Humvees through the military, the first run of them, you could convert them into Hummers for sale.

554
00:45:37,364 --> 00:45:37,645
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.

555
00:45:37,705 --> 00:45:43,689
[SPEAKER_04]: But then they actually, when they decommissioned them, they had to destroy them so that they wouldn't be sold and compete.

556
00:45:43,929 --> 00:45:46,431
[SPEAKER_07]: The same thing goes with Warner Brothers, for example.

557
00:45:46,451 --> 00:45:50,795
[SPEAKER_07]: Warner Brothers, they just instilled a 60-day rental window on all titles.

558
00:45:53,216 --> 00:45:54,137
[SPEAKER_07]: That's for everybody.

559
00:45:54,157 --> 00:45:57,720
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, before they used to have it where it was just Redbox and stuff.

560
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:58,421
[SPEAKER_07]: Now it's everybody.

561
00:45:58,441 --> 00:46:01,203
[SPEAKER_07]: And I heard something I think they may even do at some point.

562
00:46:01,223 --> 00:46:08,188
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be six months once this all... The rumor is it's going to be turned into six months once all these contracts are up.

563
00:46:08,689 --> 00:46:08,829
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

564
00:46:09,591 --> 00:46:12,173
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, they hate the used industry.

565
00:46:12,213 --> 00:46:15,595
[SPEAKER_07]: But they're the only ones, though, so far that are kind of going to the extreme.

566
00:46:16,095 --> 00:46:18,217
[SPEAKER_07]: But once again, though, I'm sorry.

567
00:46:19,618 --> 00:46:27,423
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I understand that people buying used or whatever are going to be affecting the amount of new copies that a store brings in.

568
00:46:27,463 --> 00:46:31,605
[SPEAKER_07]: Because if you have like 60 used copies, you're not going to be bringing in a lot of new copies.

569
00:46:31,665 --> 00:46:33,847
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, yes, that would eat at your bottom line a little bit.

570
00:46:34,347 --> 00:47:03,727
[SPEAKER_07]: but the people that sell back those used copies take that money to buy new fucking games that you may be producing so the fact that you're just stopping people from buying new games there's only a finite amount of money these gamers are going to have and if you're taking away that avenue for them to sell it back used and trade in to get a new game that you might be making so that you can get your fucking commission check then people are going to buy less games overall so you're just hurting yourselves that's really all it's going to end up being

571
00:47:04,668 --> 00:47:14,619
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess at the end of the day, most of the games I buy, I buy new, so it really doesn't end up affecting me, but you kind of can't help but go, they're going to make a buck wherever they can.

572
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:18,944
[SPEAKER_02]: But myself directly, is this going to change my game buying habits?

573
00:47:19,024 --> 00:47:19,645
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably not.

574
00:47:20,886 --> 00:47:30,533
[SPEAKER_02]: I will say that I kind of noticed that this year I really am cutting back, and maybe it's just the economy or what have you, I really am kind of cutting back on the games I plan on buying new.

575
00:47:30,974 --> 00:47:40,280
[SPEAKER_02]: I go back a couple years and I probably would have bought a lot of games over the holiday season, but this year I really can't think of a lot that I'm going to buy.

576
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:41,962
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not even sure I'm going to buy Dance Central 2.

577
00:47:42,922 --> 00:47:43,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Sains over the third.

578
00:47:43,683 --> 00:47:43,783
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

579
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:06,941
[SPEAKER_07]: See, that's one of those games where I might want to check it out used.

580
00:48:07,161 --> 00:48:10,202
[SPEAKER_07]: That will have a pass, I'm sure, but here's the best part about Saints Row III.

581
00:48:10,922 --> 00:48:11,302
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck them.

582
00:48:11,442 --> 00:48:12,482
[SPEAKER_07]: They've got system link.

583
00:48:12,622 --> 00:48:14,063
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't need to go on your fucking internets.

584
00:48:16,023 --> 00:48:17,063
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll just play it local.

585
00:48:17,343 --> 00:48:18,384
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't need your internets.

586
00:48:18,924 --> 00:48:19,644
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's move on.

587
00:48:19,664 --> 00:48:20,944
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got lots more stories to tackle.

588
00:48:20,984 --> 00:48:21,524
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.

589
00:48:22,885 --> 00:48:24,345
[SPEAKER_04]: There's actually something on my microphone.

590
00:48:24,385 --> 00:48:25,205
[SPEAKER_04]: How about WiiStuff?

591
00:48:28,553 --> 00:48:30,073
[SPEAKER_04]: The new Wii Bundle.

592
00:48:30,313 --> 00:48:31,094
[SPEAKER_04]: Wii!

593
00:48:31,274 --> 00:48:35,955
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to have new Super Mario Brothers, but it's going to lose something very important to a lot of people.

594
00:48:36,575 --> 00:48:37,295
[SPEAKER_04]: GameCube support.

595
00:48:38,016 --> 00:48:38,696
[SPEAKER_04]: No more GameCube.

596
00:48:38,976 --> 00:48:39,316
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

597
00:48:40,636 --> 00:48:41,636
[SPEAKER_04]: We're pulling a PlayStation.

598
00:48:41,937 --> 00:48:46,918
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is like our version of what Europe got at the Gamescom or whatever, right?

599
00:48:47,438 --> 00:48:47,859
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty much.

600
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:53,524
[SPEAKER_04]: It is going to have though, actually the system itself is black.

601
00:48:54,444 --> 00:49:00,510
[SPEAKER_04]: It has a black Wiimote Plus and a Nunchuck and a Super Mario Galaxy soundtrack.

602
00:49:01,851 --> 00:49:03,252
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's going to be out on October 23rd for $150.

603
00:49:03,392 --> 00:49:04,593
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't $150 what a Wii costs right now?

604
00:49:06,315 --> 00:49:06,595
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes it is.

605
00:49:12,077 --> 00:49:17,000
[SPEAKER_04]: and they say that the Mario Kart bundle is going to still be available along with the new one.

606
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:18,421
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that true, Loki?

607
00:49:19,942 --> 00:49:21,663
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like half shaking, half nodding.

608
00:49:21,683 --> 00:49:22,883
[SPEAKER_02]: No, yes, it's true.

609
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:25,105
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they're going to sell the old ones until they run out of stock.

610
00:49:25,125 --> 00:49:28,447
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm not doubting what DarkSakura is saying, but I'm like, okay, really?

611
00:49:28,487 --> 00:49:29,827
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that really the long-term plan?

612
00:49:29,888 --> 00:49:30,428
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that really?

613
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:46,726
[SPEAKER_04]: Dan and I, back in the day, went through the entire supply of PlayStations, DualShock systems, at KB Toys, by where I worked, so that we could find the one with the port in the back because our old one was dying.

614
00:49:47,486 --> 00:49:51,988
[SPEAKER_04]: People are that anal and will try to find the ones that's got what they want in it.

615
00:49:52,208 --> 00:49:54,889
[SPEAKER_02]: People still want a PlayStation 3 that'll play PS2 games.

616
00:49:55,129 --> 00:49:55,849
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got one.

617
00:49:56,249 --> 00:49:57,430
[SPEAKER_04]: I have one that'll play PS1.

618
00:49:58,795 --> 00:49:59,696
[SPEAKER_02]: They all play PS1.

619
00:49:59,836 --> 00:50:03,718
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, but mine will play PS1, PS2, it's the whole thing.

620
00:50:05,059 --> 00:50:10,222
[SPEAKER_02]: Which one of the games I didn't mention I played this week, I actually put in old school PS1 games on my PlayStation 3.

621
00:50:11,003 --> 00:50:15,205
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the random games I played this week was like the 30 Activision game collection.

622
00:50:15,766 --> 00:50:20,048
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, like going back and playing it now, I'm like, god, this is some sloppy ass packaging.

623
00:50:20,088 --> 00:50:23,410
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, what are these like LSD influenced title menu graphics?

624
00:50:23,430 --> 00:50:24,171
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I can't even...

625
00:50:24,656 --> 00:50:26,297
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I've had the urge to go back and play?

626
00:50:26,417 --> 00:50:26,617
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

627
00:50:26,838 --> 00:50:27,418
[SPEAKER_04]: Jumping Flash.

628
00:50:28,719 --> 00:50:31,060
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, plug it in and go play it in the front room.

629
00:50:31,401 --> 00:50:31,701
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

630
00:50:32,261 --> 00:50:33,282
[SPEAKER_04]: And give myself a seizure.

631
00:50:33,922 --> 00:50:37,704
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

632
00:50:56,471 --> 00:50:58,212
[SPEAKER_02]: Super Mario All-Stars Limited Run Game

633
00:51:19,517 --> 00:51:19,978
[SPEAKER_04]: GameCube Free Edition

634
00:51:35,481 --> 00:51:37,782
[SPEAKER_02]: The Horizontal, the vertically challenged we.

635
00:51:37,902 --> 00:51:38,202
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

636
00:51:38,422 --> 00:51:38,902
[SPEAKER_02]: Essentially.

637
00:51:40,342 --> 00:51:41,743
[SPEAKER_04]: The we.

638
00:51:43,043 --> 00:51:44,023
[SPEAKER_07]: The not so we.

639
00:51:44,263 --> 00:51:45,584
[SPEAKER_07]: I just, I don't understand.

640
00:51:47,364 --> 00:51:49,164
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the PSP Go again.

641
00:51:49,224 --> 00:51:52,705
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, hey, we got this new system that's coming out and it's got less features.

642
00:51:52,725 --> 00:51:53,906
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's not that bad.

643
00:51:53,946 --> 00:51:55,046
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not that bad.

644
00:51:55,906 --> 00:52:00,772
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I think most people that give a hoot about GameCube compatibility already got one.

645
00:52:01,352 --> 00:52:04,155
[SPEAKER_02]: But still, the math just doesn't make sense.

646
00:52:04,295 --> 00:52:10,002
[SPEAKER_02]: They're literally cutting it out for no reason than maybe they plan to sell the games on the Wii U.

647
00:52:11,403 --> 00:52:14,845
[SPEAKER_02]: Which I'm sure is the... That's really the long-term thing we're looking at.

648
00:52:14,945 --> 00:52:16,086
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why they're cutting it now.

649
00:52:16,106 --> 00:52:18,508
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they know on the Wii U they want to sell the GameCube games.

650
00:52:18,568 --> 00:52:18,948
[SPEAKER_02]: Just wait.

651
00:52:19,308 --> 00:52:19,648
[SPEAKER_02]: Just wait.

652
00:52:19,869 --> 00:52:20,589
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's going to happen.

653
00:52:21,209 --> 00:52:27,233
[SPEAKER_07]: But... Still though, I mean, if you're looking for... You could probably just get the Mario Kart thing.

654
00:52:27,574 --> 00:52:34,498
[SPEAKER_07]: And hell, I'm sure you could probably... If you really didn't want Mario Kart, you could probably trade it in someplace and get New Super Mario Bros.

655
00:52:34,538 --> 00:52:36,800
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I'm sure a lot of stores have it.

656
00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:37,040
[SPEAKER_07]: It's...

657
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:40,022
[SPEAKER_07]: A popular game, and I'm sure a lot of people have traded it in.

658
00:52:40,503 --> 00:52:44,426
[SPEAKER_07]: But just... I don't understand.

659
00:52:45,127 --> 00:52:47,329
[SPEAKER_07]: You might need the GameCube controller for something else later on.

660
00:52:48,450 --> 00:52:50,171
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a crazy random question.

661
00:52:50,271 --> 00:52:54,835
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think these new Wii's are being done to combat a lot of the modding that people are doing to their Wii's?

662
00:52:55,296 --> 00:52:55,676
[SPEAKER_07]: I think so.

663
00:52:55,816 --> 00:53:00,760
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I think a lot of that modding stuff runs off of files that were part of the GameCube.

664
00:53:02,042 --> 00:53:03,363
[SPEAKER_07]: Like the dull files or whatever.

665
00:53:03,383 --> 00:53:03,543
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

666
00:53:04,163 --> 00:53:08,766
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I'm understanding why they just are slowly taking that out.

667
00:53:08,786 --> 00:53:13,069
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if that's part of it, that makes a lot more sense now why they've removed it.

668
00:53:13,610 --> 00:53:22,315
[SPEAKER_02]: It's akin to PlayStation 3 deleting the other OS support but without all the hubbub because, you know, this is a physical thing.

669
00:53:22,415 --> 00:53:26,418
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo can't come to my house and take the GameCube compatibility out of my existing Wii, you know?

670
00:53:26,878 --> 00:53:44,066
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah or they couldn't but that wouldn't be good for them yeah not a good idea that would require that would require uh releasing like an online patch which the Wii is very limited in what they're able to do yeah all right anyhow let's move on with some more news Loki

671
00:53:44,976 --> 00:53:53,124
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're going to have some new, as you may remember, the Halo HD remake, the Halo Combat Evolved Anniversary Edition.

672
00:53:53,264 --> 00:53:58,028
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to be doing some sort of like, I'm sorry, I'm reading the wrong story.

673
00:53:58,428 --> 00:53:58,989
[SPEAKER_07]: Stupid me.

674
00:53:59,009 --> 00:54:00,811
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, what the hell are you doing, Loki?

675
00:54:01,671 --> 00:54:04,254
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's talk a little bit about the PlayStation Network.

676
00:54:05,094 --> 00:54:10,139
[SPEAKER_07]: The OLR host compatibility has been removed out of Loki in the most recent upgrade, apparently.

677
00:54:10,339 --> 00:54:11,100
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, exactly.

678
00:54:12,601 --> 00:54:26,273
[SPEAKER_07]: The PlayStation Network hasn't really been compromised, but some of the data or whatever that was grabbed from the PlayStation Network the last time has been used to try to compromise the PlayStation Network again, I guess.

679
00:54:26,633 --> 00:54:41,797
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically a lot of user accounts, I want to say it was like 75,000 or something like that, were locked out because people have been attempting to sign in using login and password information that were obtained from

680
00:54:42,878 --> 00:54:46,961
[SPEAKER_07]: One or more compromised lists from other companies' sites or sources.

681
00:54:57,590 --> 00:55:06,155
[SPEAKER_07]: and I'm wondering if maybe that has something to do with also the Xbox Live users which we're still getting a lot more of those now finally being reported.

682
00:55:07,836 --> 00:55:14,780
[SPEAKER_07]: Much like Sky had a problem with people breaking into his account and spending money on FIFA shit.

683
00:55:16,101 --> 00:55:18,262
[SPEAKER_07]: There's been a lot more people talking about it.

684
00:55:18,682 --> 00:55:21,904
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you Gaming Press for covering this a month after it was news.

685
00:55:22,384 --> 00:55:39,692
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, Ars Technica actually started reporting a lot of people actually telling them that say, hey, you know, my game account was hacked and people were, they bought, you know, FIFA 11 and also like the gold pass or whatever, spent $100 on my account.

686
00:55:41,133 --> 00:56:01,759
[SPEAKER_07]: and there's been a lot of other things people are starting to see FIFA 12 and purchases are kind of related to that and of course you know sure enough all of my Microsoft points that were stored on my Xbox Live account had been spent on in-game items for FIFA 11 I don't own that game hell I don't even like soccer games

687
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:04,921
[SPEAKER_07]: and whoever spent my Microsoft points had tried to purchase more.

688
00:56:05,001 --> 00:56:10,525
[SPEAKER_07]: Presumably, when the purchase failed, they abandoned my account and went to steal from some other unsuspecting gamer.

689
00:56:11,206 --> 00:56:12,607
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, I think that's kind of the case.

690
00:56:12,687 --> 00:56:14,728
[SPEAKER_07]: So, of course, you know, change passwords.

691
00:56:16,329 --> 00:56:17,110
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully, that's enough.

692
00:56:17,830 --> 00:56:21,313
[SPEAKER_07]: And, of course, Microsoft went, you know, went pressed for a statement.

693
00:56:22,173 --> 00:56:27,355
[SPEAKER_07]: We do not have any evidence that the Xbox Live service has been compromised.

694
00:56:27,835 --> 00:56:34,777
[SPEAKER_07]: We take the security of our service seriously and work on an ongoing basis to improve it against any evolving threats.

695
00:56:35,077 --> 00:56:41,319
[SPEAKER_07]: However, a limited number of members have contacted us regarding unauthorized access to their accounts by outside individuals.

696
00:56:41,379 --> 00:56:45,821
[SPEAKER_07]: We are working with our impacted members directly to resolve any unauthorized charges.

697
00:56:46,742 --> 00:57:04,000
[SPEAKER_07]: to their accounts as always we highly recommend our members follow the Xbox Live account security guidance provided at xbox.com security what a lovely sanitized response from the Xbox Media Relations Department what a lovely sanitized response because some could mean a million

698
00:57:04,878 --> 00:57:05,639
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I get it.

699
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:09,484
[SPEAKER_02]: Microsoft does not want to panic on their hands like what Sony had to go through.

700
00:57:09,584 --> 00:57:17,154
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, they're trying to poo-poo this and make it sound like it's not that many people when I've known at least, at least 12 people that this has happened to.

701
00:57:17,174 --> 00:57:21,299
[SPEAKER_02]: And you just read the comments and like... Do you know how many people I've known that have had their PlayStation accounts hacked?

702
00:57:22,293 --> 00:57:22,773
[SPEAKER_02]: Zero.

703
00:57:23,573 --> 00:57:26,054
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean hacked for, like, money or false charges.

704
00:57:26,614 --> 00:57:35,897
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, on this story, there's 109 comments, and a lot of them are saying, yeah, hey, are there any... Let's see here.

705
00:57:37,498 --> 00:57:37,678
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

706
00:57:41,164 --> 00:57:42,265
[SPEAKER_07]: My account was hacked yesterday.

707
00:57:42,285 --> 00:57:44,569
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm getting the standard 25-day lockout treatment.

708
00:57:44,609 --> 00:57:47,675
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm also disputing the charges on my credit card.

709
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:52,283
[SPEAKER_07]: On July 10th, the same thing happened to me.

710
00:57:56,403 --> 00:57:57,324
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see here.

711
00:57:57,364 --> 00:58:00,046
[SPEAKER_07]: A couple people I know have had this happen.

712
00:58:01,166 --> 00:58:04,309
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's a lot of people that are saying, hey, this has happened to me and stuff.

713
00:58:04,349 --> 00:58:06,891
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's why they even kind of made a comment on the story.

714
00:58:06,931 --> 00:58:12,334
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, there's been a lot of people that have been writing us saying, hey, the same thing has happened to me.

715
00:58:12,675 --> 00:58:14,176
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, it's a little bit of a pattern there.

716
00:58:14,716 --> 00:58:15,136
[SPEAKER_07]: A little bit.

717
00:58:15,437 --> 00:58:17,058
[SPEAKER_07]: Got to figure it out because...

718
00:58:18,447 --> 00:58:19,548
[SPEAKER_07]: And why is it FIFA players?

719
00:58:19,928 --> 00:58:22,629
[SPEAKER_02]: And why is it 30 days that your account gets locked?

720
00:58:22,669 --> 00:58:24,450
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember, guys, I didn't play my Xbox for a month.

721
00:58:26,011 --> 00:58:31,214
[SPEAKER_02]: And I made some purchases on PlayStation 3 instead during that time of things I might have bought on the Xbox 360 instead.

722
00:58:32,915 --> 00:58:35,837
[SPEAKER_02]: I think their whole process needs to be fixed.

723
00:58:35,897 --> 00:58:37,058
[SPEAKER_02]: That's another big problem.

724
00:58:37,418 --> 00:58:40,320
[SPEAKER_02]: Microsoft does some very shady online things that they do.

725
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:42,941
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the whole credit card removal thing too.

726
00:58:43,982 --> 00:58:44,282
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow.

727
00:58:45,903 --> 00:58:47,383
[SPEAKER_02]: I refuse to give them my new card.

728
00:58:47,583 --> 00:58:50,705
[SPEAKER_02]: I will not give them my new card info because my last one just expired.

729
00:58:50,765 --> 00:58:51,905
[SPEAKER_02]: They will not get my new one.

730
00:58:51,925 --> 00:58:54,306
[SPEAKER_07]: They'll still try to charge it though.

731
00:58:55,167 --> 00:58:56,307
[SPEAKER_07]: They will still try to charge it.

732
00:58:56,547 --> 00:58:58,308
[SPEAKER_07]: Good luck.

733
00:58:58,468 --> 00:59:02,150
[SPEAKER_07]: They will lock out your account until you give them a new card.

734
00:59:03,270 --> 00:59:06,531
[SPEAKER_02]: I will close my Xbox account if it comes to that.

735
00:59:06,551 --> 00:59:07,952
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going on record saying that.

736
00:59:08,352 --> 00:59:10,153
[SPEAKER_02]: They are not getting my new credit card number.

737
00:59:10,453 --> 00:59:39,021
[SPEAKER_07]: if they were able to I will turn in my seven year whatever it is Xbox Live membership I'm done if that's the case let it be known there's a lot of stuff I see where people will change their credit card and then they'll because they'll try to renew and then it doesn't auto renew and so they give them a new card to charge it and then they'll charge another year on there and they get two years instead of one see that shit's shady like there's a lot of shady shit going on right now

738
00:59:40,222 --> 00:59:41,543
[SPEAKER_02]: in all this Xbox Live stuff.

739
00:59:41,563 --> 00:59:42,665
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we need some answers.

740
00:59:43,085 --> 00:59:47,171
[SPEAKER_02]: And stop with this corporate speak.

741
00:59:47,291 --> 00:59:48,673
[SPEAKER_02]: You should be able to get out of that stuff.

742
00:59:48,693 --> 00:59:51,316
[SPEAKER_02]: This is why people are fucking mad at corporations right now, by the way.

743
00:59:51,616 --> 00:59:56,603
[SPEAKER_02]: Not to go on a tangent that I really don't want to go on on this program, but this shit is why people are mad.

744
00:59:56,903 --> 00:59:58,025
[SPEAKER_02]: This is why people are mad.

745
00:59:58,485 --> 00:59:59,005
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

746
01:00:16,877 --> 01:00:21,359
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, moving on to a story that you didn't hear anything about just 10 minutes ago on this program.

747
01:00:21,820 --> 01:00:26,182
[SPEAKER_02]: Some changes are coming to Halo Anniversary, talking about the Kinect functionality.

748
01:00:26,222 --> 01:00:28,523
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the details came out this week at New York Comic Con.

749
01:00:29,223 --> 01:00:39,889
[SPEAKER_02]: There's going to be the feature to analyze enemies, meaning that you can actually talk to your Kinect and go into the library or something like that and look at, I don't know, your enemies, I guess.

750
01:00:40,849 --> 01:00:41,269

01:01:21,814 --> 01:01:29,819
[SPEAKER_07]: And also, you know, before this, the only other thing that they said that you could use to connect for was switching between Classic and HD mode.

754
01:01:30,739 --> 01:01:31,800
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanna play Classic!

755
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:33,081
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanna play HD!

756
01:01:33,621 --> 01:01:35,202
[SPEAKER_07]: Why would I need to do that on the fly?

757
01:01:35,902 --> 01:01:36,603
[SPEAKER_07]: Who cares?

758
01:01:38,226 --> 01:01:54,255
[SPEAKER_02]: that's not a full price game so alright that's that's again Halo Anniversary Edition like in another year probably would have bought the game new but this year just not not enough into it to really want to buy it sorry maybe I'll rent it

01:02:30,855 --> 01:02:35,518

[SPEAKER_02]: and that's it, that's everything alright, let me travel to Japan and talk about some of the stuff that's coming out in Japan this week starting off on the Xbox 360 Dead Island gets a Japanese release this week as well as Deus Ex Human Revolution FIFA 12 World Class Soccer Hacking Extreme NBA 2K12 all out on Xbox 360 in Japan this week

818
01:07:24,596 --> 01:07:25,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on to the PlayStation 3.

819
01:07:26,657 --> 01:07:29,759
[SPEAKER_02]: I imagine you'll see a lot of that same stuff just on the PlayStation 3.

820
01:07:30,479 --> 01:07:34,341
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, Dead Island, Deus Ex, FIFA 12, NBA 2K12.

821
01:07:34,381 --> 01:07:35,282
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a couple others, though.

822
01:07:35,342 --> 01:07:37,003
[SPEAKER_02]: Ratchet and Clank, all 4-1.

823
01:07:37,643 --> 01:07:44,047
[SPEAKER_02]: And Gekke Juban Macross F, Sayonara no Tsubasa, Hybrid Pack.

824
01:07:44,887 --> 01:07:46,248
[SPEAKER_02]: That is coming out this week.

825
01:07:46,288 --> 01:07:47,348
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess this... What is this?

826
01:07:47,428 --> 01:07:50,730
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this like a... Oh, it's the movie and the game.

827
01:07:50,790 --> 01:07:51,691
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why it's a hybrid pack.

828
01:07:51,711 --> 01:07:54,232
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's the movie and probably a PlayStation Network game.

829
01:07:54,672 --> 01:07:55,493
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's like a Blu-ray.

830
01:07:55,593 --> 01:07:56,373
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, because it's a Blu-ray.

831
01:07:56,573 --> 01:07:59,275
[SPEAKER_02]: So it comes with the Blu-ray and it comes with the game that goes with it.

832
01:07:59,415 --> 01:08:00,415
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like an all-in-one pack.

833
01:08:01,516 --> 01:08:03,697
[SPEAKER_02]: That is out on PlayStation 3 this week.

834
01:08:04,478 --> 01:08:06,819
[SPEAKER_02]: Going to some other systems...

835
01:08:09,665 --> 01:08:15,191
[SPEAKER_02]: On the Sony PSP, we have FIFA 12 is there as well.

836
01:08:15,731 --> 01:08:22,718
[SPEAKER_02]: And Naruto Shippuden, Naruto Impact, because you know it's just not a week without a Naruto game coming out in some form or another.

837
01:08:23,579 --> 01:08:26,943
[SPEAKER_02]: Also a brand new type of memory stick, I guess a 4GB one.

838
01:08:27,003 --> 01:08:28,404
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this with branding on it?

839
01:08:28,885 --> 01:08:31,968
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this has some branding for Uminiko no Naku Koro.

840
01:08:34,887 --> 01:08:38,409
[SPEAKER_02]: Lastly, trying to go to the 3DS real quick and see if we have anything over there.

841
01:08:40,090 --> 01:08:42,291
[SPEAKER_02]: Note the 3DS in Misty Pink is this week.

842
01:08:42,331 --> 01:08:44,993
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember the DS for girls is this week.

843
01:08:45,573 --> 01:08:50,196
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Japanese version of Tetris on the 3DS is out this week.

844
01:08:52,097 --> 01:08:52,477
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

845
01:08:53,618 --> 01:08:55,159
[SPEAKER_02]: How about the UK, DarkSakura?

846
01:08:55,837 --> 01:09:23,127
[SPEAKER_04]: on the 19th we have Beat Hazard Ultra and Dungeon Defenders Ratchet and Clank all for one on PS3 Worms Crazy Golf The Sims 3 Pets so looking forward to that that was actually on the 20th my bad on the 21st we have Adventures of Tintin The Secret of the Unicorn and Captain America Super Soldier on 3DS FIFA Manager 12 Football Manager 2012 which of course is real football and not the crap that they call football over here

847
01:09:24,047 --> 01:09:40,212
[SPEAKER_04]: Jacket Alliance Back in Action, Jonah Lomu Rugby Challenge, Naruto Shippuden 3D, The New Era on 3DS, and Naruto Shippuden Ultimate Ninja Impact, Tetris Axis, Naruto for everyone, Tropico 4, and Batman Arkham City.

848
01:09:41,273 --> 01:09:41,553
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

849
01:09:41,973 --> 01:09:42,673
[SPEAKER_02]: Busy week over there.

850
01:09:43,427 --> 01:09:44,348
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

851
01:10:02,869 --> 01:10:09,955
[SPEAKER_07]: and basically Microsoft's a very big company and you've got Twisted Pixel, a relatively small developer.

852
01:10:10,376 --> 01:10:21,104
[SPEAKER_07]: We're very interested that they get to stay who they are and they get to retain the magic that they have as a small indie and also we'd like to leave the golden goose alone so to speak.

853
01:10:21,505 --> 01:10:28,070
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically they're going to be able to do kind of what they want but still have some financial backing to go with that.

854
01:10:28,110 --> 01:10:31,413
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe some better projects because they'll have a little bit more to work with.

855
01:10:32,773 --> 01:10:44,925
[SPEAKER_02]: so that's kind of cool because they're definitely a unique developer I mean it's not too surprising I kind of already thought they were in bed with Microsoft because hasn't all their shit been exclusive anyway?

856
01:10:44,945 --> 01:10:46,046
[SPEAKER_07]: um

857
01:10:47,845 --> 01:11:11,057
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know about that I think they had some stuff that was on PC but yeah I think for the most part it's been exclusive to Microsoft probably the Microsoft well PC still counts if it's for Windows yeah that's true so they can still develop for that I'm wondering if they're about to be trusted with some big Microsoft franchise to make a game for that

858
01:11:11,997 --> 01:11:13,718
[SPEAKER_02]: or, I don't know, maybe Microsoft just wants a piece of it.

859
01:11:13,738 --> 01:11:15,860
[SPEAKER_07]: They just don't have a lot of big franchises anymore, though.

860
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:23,024
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, if you think about it, it's just Halo and Forza and Fable, I guess.

861
01:11:23,625 --> 01:11:25,086
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not touching Fable, I know that.

862
01:11:26,867 --> 01:11:27,127
[SPEAKER_07]: Who knows?

863
01:11:27,167 --> 01:11:28,448
[SPEAKER_02]: There could be something new in the works.

864
01:11:28,468 --> 01:11:30,929
[SPEAKER_04]: If they can make anything better than Fable 3, that'd be great.

865
01:11:30,949 --> 01:11:31,910
[SPEAKER_02]: A new cameo game.

866
01:11:32,250 --> 01:11:35,431
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be something new for the new system, too.

867
01:11:36,212 --> 01:11:38,793
[SPEAKER_02]: There's got to be stuff under development for the new Xbox.

868
01:11:38,813 --> 01:11:41,974
[SPEAKER_02]: We've heard a lot of rumblings about that, whatever it may be.

869
01:11:42,094 --> 01:11:50,678
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe because these guys did Explosion Man and all that, they're tasked with making some must-have game on the new system.

870
01:11:50,958 --> 01:11:51,278
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows?

871
01:11:52,098 --> 01:11:52,839
[SPEAKER_02]: Just throwing it out there.

872
01:11:52,859 --> 01:11:56,580
[SPEAKER_02]: There's always new franchises that can come up with something unique and brand new.

873
01:11:56,720 --> 01:11:57,441
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a sequel.

874
01:11:57,901 --> 01:11:58,401
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

875
01:11:59,679 --> 01:12:01,260
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's see.

876
01:12:01,621 --> 01:12:08,566
[SPEAKER_02]: One more story for you guys for this half of the show, and that is about Ubisoft delaying a game called Rocksmith.

877
01:12:09,327 --> 01:12:10,508
[SPEAKER_02]: You familiar with Rocksmith?

878
01:12:11,208 --> 01:12:12,489
[SPEAKER_02]: That's alright, a lot of people aren't.

879
01:12:12,849 --> 01:12:24,559
[SPEAKER_02]: Rocksmith is the game that has the real guitar with it, which I kind of thought Rock Band 3 was supposed to kind of cover that, but I guess Rocksmith is supposed to be more like you actually see the frets on the screen.

880
01:12:24,599 --> 01:12:25,699
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot different.

881
01:12:25,779 --> 01:12:26,760
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot easier to learn.

882
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:28,702
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this is the game my friend was working on.

883
01:12:29,182 --> 01:12:29,522
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, really?

884
01:12:29,702 --> 01:12:29,902
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

885
01:12:30,122 --> 01:12:30,963
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's been delayed.

886
01:12:31,783 --> 01:12:34,124
[SPEAKER_02]: And now it's going to be launched in 2012 in Europe.

887
01:12:34,564 --> 01:12:39,525
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess this is because of some complaint that was against Ubisoft.

888
01:12:40,126 --> 01:12:42,266
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, filed by a band named Rocksmith.

889
01:12:42,586 --> 01:12:43,427
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, how funny.

890
01:12:44,547 --> 01:12:48,348
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess now there's a whole ugly thing that's got to be settled around that.

891
01:12:49,269 --> 01:12:52,150
[SPEAKER_02]: Court documents say that the dispute could go through February 2012.

892
01:12:52,930 --> 01:12:55,711
[SPEAKER_02]: So until that's resolved, this game is delayed.

893
01:12:56,511 --> 01:12:59,954
[SPEAKER_07]: Unless you happen to buy a PS3 version, which is region free.

894
01:13:02,356 --> 01:13:02,937
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay.

895
01:13:02,997 --> 01:13:04,378
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, if you're really in a hurry.

896
01:13:04,738 --> 01:13:05,999
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the game not coming out here in America?

897
01:13:06,280 --> 01:13:07,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it comes out next week.

898
01:13:07,321 --> 01:13:07,681
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

899
01:13:08,542 --> 01:13:11,644
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just, you know, we don't have a band named Rocksmith over here.

900
01:13:11,784 --> 01:13:12,545
[SPEAKER_02]: They're over in Europe.

901
01:13:12,825 --> 01:13:13,266
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

902
01:13:14,507 --> 01:13:14,787
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

903
01:13:15,167 --> 01:13:20,012
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's stop talking about these newfangled games and let's go back to the classics.

904
01:13:20,352 --> 01:13:20,532
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go.

905
01:13:21,827 --> 01:13:23,869
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, what's a classic game of the week?

906
01:13:38,143 --> 01:14:06,458
[SPEAKER_04]: Castle of Illusion starring Mickey Mouse because we talked about it last week and I started thinking about it so it's this in Japan it was known as Castle of Illusion I Love Mickey Mouse Great Wonderland Castle Adventure really long name huh and it came out in 1990 and it was on the Mega Drive slash Genesis developed by Sega of Japan and it was one of the parts of the games that were released right before Sonic the Hedgehog came out

907
01:14:07,818 --> 01:14:09,380
[SPEAKER_04]: And I love this game, so shut up.

908
01:14:10,401 --> 01:14:12,723
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a side-scrolling game, and you play as Mickey Mouse.

909
01:14:13,223 --> 01:14:19,228
[SPEAKER_04]: And he has to save Minnie from this evil witch named Miserabelle, who wants to steal Minnie's youth.

910
01:14:19,628 --> 01:14:21,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Because Minnie apparently is young and pretty.

911
01:14:22,891 --> 01:14:26,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Who I believe was not actually a Disney villain otherwise, though, right?

912
01:14:27,415 --> 01:14:28,096
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think so.

913
01:14:28,396 --> 01:14:32,259
[SPEAKER_02]: It's interesting that they didn't use a quote-unquote real villain.

914
01:14:32,299 --> 01:14:32,640
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway...

915
01:14:34,389 --> 01:14:34,809
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

916
01:14:34,949 --> 01:14:37,892
[SPEAKER_04]: No villain is as awesome as Maleficent, the damn diva.

917
01:14:38,692 --> 01:14:39,453
[SPEAKER_04]: So, moving forward.

918
01:14:41,214 --> 01:14:46,838
[SPEAKER_04]: You play in the castle and you have to defeat different enemies and bosses by jumping on them, which makes you jump higher.

919
01:14:47,219 --> 01:14:49,440
[SPEAKER_04]: And you get apples and marbles to use as projectiles.

920
01:14:50,141 --> 01:14:53,724
[SPEAKER_04]: And you get health boosts and extra lives or bonus points.

921
01:14:53,984 --> 01:14:56,005
[SPEAKER_04]: And then after you beat the boss, you're given a gem.

922
01:14:56,406 --> 01:15:00,749
[SPEAKER_04]: When you get all of the gems, you build a rainbow bridge that lets Mickey walk into the castle.

923
01:15:01,269 --> 01:15:01,630
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

924
01:15:19,373 --> 01:15:22,454
[SPEAKER_04]: It also did come out on the Master System, but they redid it.

925
01:15:22,894 --> 01:15:33,017
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the Game Gear version is actually exactly like the Master System version because it's one of the ones that ran in Game Gear, one of the Game Gear games that ran in Master System compatibility mode.

926
01:15:33,978 --> 01:15:36,798
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean, there's not really a whole lot to say about it.

927
01:15:36,899 --> 01:15:37,899
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a cute game.

928
01:15:38,019 --> 01:15:39,559
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got some good challenge to it.

929
01:15:40,180 --> 01:15:40,720
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fun.

930
01:15:44,184 --> 01:15:45,705
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, Rob, you're looking at it, right?

931
01:15:45,745 --> 01:15:46,725
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a fun little platformer.

932
01:15:46,745 --> 01:16:01,493
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I didn't own a Genesis when I was younger, but I do remember I remember there was kind of a stink because this came out around maybe a year or two after the NES had Mickey Mousecapade which was kind of their big game and Capcom had the Disney license for Nintendo, though.

933
01:16:01,593 --> 01:16:03,654
[SPEAKER_02]: They weren't really putting stuff out on Genesis at the time.

934
01:16:04,014 --> 01:16:08,096
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, wasn't Capcom's first Genesis game the Street Fighter Championship Edition?

935
01:16:08,536 --> 01:16:09,117
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was.

936
01:16:10,037 --> 01:16:10,417
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so.

937
01:16:10,457 --> 01:16:12,238
[SPEAKER_02]: I seem to remember that from my gaming history.

938
01:16:12,679 --> 01:16:13,139
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um...

939
01:16:13,579 --> 01:16:15,683
[SPEAKER_04]: Street Fighter 2 came out before Championship Edition.

940
01:16:16,536 --> 01:16:18,197
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no, but remember the Genesis one?

941
01:16:18,357 --> 01:16:20,338
[SPEAKER_02]: The Genesis got the Championship Edition.

942
01:16:20,378 --> 01:16:21,579
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like a big freaking deal.

943
01:16:21,879 --> 01:16:25,061
[SPEAKER_02]: But then the Super Nintendo got Turbo Championship Edition, so it kind of went back and forth.

944
01:16:25,582 --> 01:16:29,084
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, my point is that I do remember this game.

945
01:16:29,104 --> 01:16:31,485
[SPEAKER_02]: I never played it when I was younger because I didn't own a Genesis.

946
01:16:31,886 --> 01:16:39,911
[SPEAKER_02]: But I remember wanting to because I thought, gosh, this game looks a lot better than Mickey Mouse Capade, which actually was a pretty sweet NES game.

947
01:16:40,551 --> 01:16:43,773
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you've done that as a classic Game of the Week before, but if you haven't, it should be someday.

948
01:16:44,013 --> 01:16:52,457
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, this one, actually, I don't know if I've ever told you about the week I traded my SNES for my friend's Genesis and Master System converter.

949
01:16:53,538 --> 01:16:54,658
[SPEAKER_04]: This was one of the games I borrowed.

950
01:16:55,218 --> 01:16:55,579
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, nice.

951
01:16:55,979 --> 01:16:58,940
[SPEAKER_04]: And I had a field day with this game.

952
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:00,061
[SPEAKER_04]: I loved it so much.

953
01:17:00,541 --> 01:17:01,942
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there's so much more to do.

954
01:17:02,022 --> 01:17:07,824
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, not just, you had the, you know, the jumping boosts and you had swinging from vines.

955
01:17:07,964 --> 01:17:11,166
[SPEAKER_02]: Just graphically, this game was really pretty to look at.

956
01:17:11,186 --> 01:17:14,027
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to remember again, guys, this was a long time ago this game came out.

957
01:17:14,347 --> 01:17:18,449
[SPEAKER_02]: But some of these environments, like this level that we're swatching Mickey in here on the YouTube right now.

958
01:17:18,849 --> 01:17:19,510
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

959
01:17:39,842 --> 01:17:42,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, um, there was a sequel.

960
01:17:43,084 --> 01:17:45,706
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I was just going to say, weird that it's never shown up on any collection.

961
01:17:45,746 --> 01:17:48,628
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I understand probably the Disney licensing probably has a lot to do with that.

962
01:17:48,929 --> 01:17:50,630
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, now they've licensed, though.

963
01:17:51,390 --> 01:17:53,051
[SPEAKER_04]: Disney took the license for Castle of Illusion.

964
01:17:53,612 --> 01:17:54,252
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's right.

965
01:17:54,272 --> 01:17:55,553
[SPEAKER_02]: We covered it last week.

966
01:17:55,573 --> 01:17:56,134
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

967
01:17:56,154 --> 01:17:56,574
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, okay.

968
01:17:57,475 --> 01:17:58,495
[SPEAKER_02]: And we don't know what they're doing with it.

969
01:17:58,555 --> 01:17:58,996
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, right.

970
01:17:59,856 --> 01:18:01,057
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably just sitting on it for a while.

971
01:18:01,078 --> 01:18:04,360
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope there's maybe a newer version of this coming out.

972
01:18:04,380 --> 01:18:04,941
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be awesome.

973
01:18:05,161 --> 01:18:07,543
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let me go a little bit further then.

974
01:18:07,603 --> 01:18:07,943
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, sure.

975
01:18:08,223 --> 01:18:12,567
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, well, first of all, there was a sequel named Land of Illusion that came out of the Master System into Game Gear.

976
01:18:13,208 --> 01:18:20,153
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Castle of Illusion was re-released in 1998 in Japan as the Sega Ages Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck on Saturn.

977
01:18:21,134 --> 01:18:23,216
[SPEAKER_04]: And that also included Quackshot.

978
01:18:24,645 --> 01:18:26,266
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a very interesting game on its own too.

979
01:18:27,567 --> 01:18:28,848
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you go.

980
01:18:29,288 --> 01:18:30,929
[SPEAKER_04]: It did have a re-release in Japan.

981
01:18:32,570 --> 01:18:32,910
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

982
01:18:33,931 --> 01:18:34,511
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool.

983
01:18:34,952 --> 01:18:39,375
[SPEAKER_02]: There it is, your classic game of the week, Castle of Illusion starring Mickey Mouse for the Sega Genesis.

984
01:18:40,135 --> 01:18:40,555
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice pick.

985
01:18:41,076 --> 01:18:41,356
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

986
01:18:42,048 --> 01:18:44,651
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, that's going to do it for part A of our big show tonight.

987
01:18:44,691 --> 01:18:45,171
[SPEAKER_02]: But don't go anywhere.

988
01:18:45,211 --> 01:18:45,752
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not done.

989
01:18:46,032 --> 01:18:47,434
[SPEAKER_02]: We still got half a show to go.

990
01:18:47,714 --> 01:18:50,177
[SPEAKER_02]: We got a lot of news coming out in the next half of the show.

991
01:18:50,657 --> 01:18:55,242
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to get to your emails as well at mailbag at orangelaundry.com and Twitter topics.

992
01:18:55,722 --> 01:18:57,764
[SPEAKER_02]: And hopefully, I'm hoping some people will call us.

993
01:18:58,305 --> 01:18:58,565
[SPEAKER_02]: Frenando Yes

994
01:19:15,905 --> 01:19:18,806
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you haven't seen that fan art?

995
01:19:19,046 --> 01:19:21,767
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to go to YYR's Twitter.

996
01:19:22,647 --> 01:19:26,048
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like YYR underscore, or maybe the other way around, underscore YYR.

997
01:19:26,068 --> 01:19:26,568
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of the two.

998
01:19:27,028 --> 01:19:28,909
[SPEAKER_02]: And he has the artwork in one of his previous tweets.

999
01:19:28,969 --> 01:19:29,389
[SPEAKER_02]: It's awesome.

1000
01:19:29,969 --> 01:19:36,231
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyhow, we'll talk with you guys in the Skype line as well as plenty more news when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1001
01:19:36,271 --> 01:19:36,711
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't go anywhere.

1002
01:19:43,487 --> 01:19:46,311
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.

1003
01:19:46,371 --> 01:19:51,098
[SPEAKER_02]: We are live on this Sunday evening, October the 16th of 2011.

1004
01:19:51,778 --> 01:19:52,379
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm out of breath.

1005
01:19:52,419 --> 01:19:53,441
[SPEAKER_02]: That was such a fast break.

1006
01:19:54,763 --> 01:19:57,747
[SPEAKER_02]: Where we're of course taping another episode of our show, episode number 432 to be exact.

1007
01:20:00,490 --> 01:20:01,010
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

1008
01:20:17,077 --> 01:20:17,337
[SPEAKER_04]: I do.

1009
01:20:17,677 --> 01:20:18,478
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to have to draw.

1010
01:20:18,938 --> 01:20:21,760
[SPEAKER_02]: My favorite is the ferret with the tongue hanging out of his mouth.

1011
01:20:22,360 --> 01:20:22,920
[SPEAKER_02]: Dead ferret.

1012
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:24,541
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like drawing the ferret.

1013
01:20:24,561 --> 01:20:30,304
[SPEAKER_02]: The question is, when's Ranma going to cosplay that?

1014
01:20:30,664 --> 01:20:31,805
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a matter of time.

1015
01:20:31,865 --> 01:20:33,005
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a matter of time.

1016
01:20:33,446 --> 01:20:33,886
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, look.

1017
01:20:33,906 --> 01:20:37,928
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to have to bulk up for it, though, because Fernando looks pretty ripped, so I'm just saying.

1018
01:20:38,528 --> 01:20:40,629
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it's going to be that hard for Ranchan.

1019
01:20:40,669 --> 01:20:41,350
[SPEAKER_04]: He was a Marine.

1020
01:20:43,075 --> 01:20:44,016
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

1021
01:20:58,593 --> 01:20:59,874
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of marathons, I gotta mention this.

1022
01:20:59,934 --> 01:21:01,436
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't believe I didn't show roll this somewhere else.

1023
01:21:01,636 --> 01:21:02,277
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to mention this.

1024
01:21:02,317 --> 01:21:03,097
[SPEAKER_02]: Need to, need to, need to.

1025
01:21:03,578 --> 01:21:06,681
[SPEAKER_02]: Extra Life happened this past weekend and congratulations.

1026
01:21:07,041 --> 01:21:07,982
[SPEAKER_02]: They broke a million dollars.

1027
01:21:08,282 --> 01:21:09,503
[SPEAKER_02]: That is outstanding.

1028
01:21:09,603 --> 01:21:10,104
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay!

1029
01:21:10,124 --> 01:21:12,887
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know we had some members of the OL Army that participated in Extra Life.

1030
01:21:13,727 --> 01:21:16,530
[SPEAKER_04]: The moment you announced that, Shermie started licking her bed in excitement.

1031
01:21:16,910 --> 01:21:17,631
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

1032
01:21:39,065 --> 01:21:47,491
[SPEAKER_02]: The date for the new Umlaut I think was announced previously, but just to reiterate, it's December 8th this year, and it's going to be flipping huge.

1033
01:21:47,851 --> 01:21:50,233
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I can't say too much.

1034
01:21:50,814 --> 01:21:56,798
[SPEAKER_02]: I may or may not know some things, but it is on Thursday, December 8th, and it's going to be awesome.

1035
01:21:57,979 --> 01:21:58,279
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

1036
01:21:59,240 --> 01:22:10,981
[SPEAKER_02]: so if you are like anywhere remotely near the San Francisco Bay Area you need to make plans to attend if you are nowhere near the San Francisco Bay Area you still should keep the day open just saying moving on

1037
01:22:12,432 --> 01:22:14,214
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go through some quick, quick news.

1038
01:22:14,274 --> 01:22:14,514
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki.

1039
01:22:15,134 --> 01:22:20,838
[SPEAKER_07]: This is quite appropriate, and I'm actually kind of psyched to play it because this is more of a puzzle game than it is a crashing game.

1040
01:22:21,219 --> 01:22:29,725
[SPEAKER_07]: But Burnout Crash is going to be coming to the iOS, both on iPad and iPod or iPhone or whatever.

1041
01:22:30,845 --> 01:22:31,666
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can check that out.

1042
01:22:32,346 --> 01:22:38,731
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's actually a pretty good fit for it because, yeah, like you said, it's more of a puzzle game and kind of disappointing.

1043
01:22:39,448 --> 01:22:40,890
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

1044
01:22:56,312 --> 01:22:57,453
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's an online MMO.

1045
01:22:57,833 --> 01:23:06,239
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess originally, you know, I guess the game was supposed to be inspired by Counter-Strike, but now it kind of... I don't know, it's more top-down.

1046
01:23:06,259 --> 01:23:10,842
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks to me like one of the old Fallout games or something like that.

1047
01:23:12,303 --> 01:23:16,146
[SPEAKER_07]: They're calling it kind of Baldur's Gate with Jagged Alliance, but...

1048
01:23:17,427 --> 01:23:24,332
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's awesome because honestly the last Shadowrun game that came out on the 360 was terrible, so this is more like it.

1049
01:23:24,892 --> 01:23:27,194
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's free to play, so cool.

1050
01:23:27,714 --> 01:23:30,596
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's being made by Sixth World, I guess.

1051
01:23:33,197 --> 01:23:37,380
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if they're... No, Sixth World was the last one, I'm sorry.

1052
01:23:37,480 --> 01:23:40,042
[SPEAKER_07]: Cliffhanger is the one that's putting this together now.

1053
01:23:41,841 --> 01:23:42,981
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh god, that's going to be awesome.

1054
01:23:43,361 --> 01:23:44,742
[SPEAKER_07]: No word yet on what's coming out.

1055
01:23:45,182 --> 01:23:46,542
[SPEAKER_02]: Shadowrun definitely has its fans.

1056
01:23:47,742 --> 01:23:50,723
[SPEAKER_02]: There's been some hit and miss games in the Shadowrun universe, so this sounds neat.

1057
01:23:50,863 --> 01:23:51,923
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks cool.

1058
01:23:52,003 --> 01:23:55,644
[SPEAKER_07]: It could be a franchise, if done well, it would be successful.

1059
01:23:57,024 --> 01:24:00,365
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, last but not least, of course, PopCap.

1060
01:24:00,585 --> 01:24:04,046
[SPEAKER_07]: They're always putting out gamer crack, if you will.

1061
01:24:04,446 --> 01:24:08,330
[SPEAKER_07]: They have a new game coming out called Popcorn Dragon.

1062
01:24:09,131 --> 01:24:14,516
[SPEAKER_07]: And in Popcorn Dragon, you shoot fireballs to make popcorn that a dragon then attempts to eat.

1063
01:24:15,177 --> 01:24:19,080
[SPEAKER_07]: They're saying it's kind of like a popcorn fruit ninja with a cute mythical beast.

1064
01:24:19,140 --> 01:24:20,802
[SPEAKER_07]: That sounds so PopCap.

1065
01:24:20,922 --> 01:24:24,125
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, when you describe it, I'm like, God, that just sounds like a PopCap game.

1066
01:24:24,385 --> 01:24:24,566
[SPEAKER_00]: To me...

1067
01:24:25,546 --> 01:24:29,089
[SPEAKER_02]: To be fair, I don't think we've really heard of anything that that studio's done for a while.

1068
01:24:29,109 --> 01:24:31,531
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, their last big, big game was Plants vs. Zombies.

1069
01:24:31,551 --> 01:24:32,351
[SPEAKER_02]: That was some time ago.

1070
01:24:33,152 --> 01:24:35,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they have to port it to every single platform.

1071
01:24:35,093 --> 01:24:35,793
[SPEAKER_02]: They had Bejeweled 3.

1072
01:24:36,134 --> 01:24:37,395
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, shit.

1073
01:24:37,415 --> 01:24:38,255
[SPEAKER_10]: I forgot about Bejeweled 3.

1074
01:24:38,295 --> 01:24:39,476
[SPEAKER_10]: You're right, you're right, you're right.

1075
01:24:39,656 --> 01:24:42,098
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, you know, it wasn't technically PopCap.

1076
01:24:42,118 --> 01:24:43,559
[SPEAKER_07]: The spinoff studio, yeah.

1077
01:24:43,579 --> 01:24:48,782
[SPEAKER_07]: But they had that, which I really wish they'd do more stuff because, you know, Unpleasant Horse is fucking amazing.

1078
01:24:50,283 --> 01:24:52,425
[SPEAKER_07]: But, yeah, they had a few things.

1079
01:24:52,990 --> 01:25:01,160
[SPEAKER_07]: this looks alright, it looks like it could be cool and I do like popcorn and dragons so it'd be worth checking out

1080
01:25:03,860 --> 01:25:05,601
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the quote they're going to put on the box.

1081
01:25:06,542 --> 01:25:10,345
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki from Orange Lounge Radio, I do love popcorn and dragons.

1082
01:25:10,965 --> 01:25:17,130
[SPEAKER_04]: It just made me think about having a little pet dragon and watching a movie and going, damn it, I want to pop this popcorn.

1083
01:25:18,971 --> 01:25:21,033
[SPEAKER_02]: Who doesn't love popcorn and dragons?

1084
01:25:21,133 --> 01:25:22,014
[SPEAKER_02]: Terrorists, that's who.

1085
01:25:22,034 --> 01:25:22,474
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

1086
01:25:22,594 --> 01:25:23,395
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like popcorn.

1087
01:25:23,915 --> 01:25:24,195
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

1088
01:25:24,295 --> 01:25:27,678
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the corn kernels get stuck up under my gums and it hurts.

1089
01:25:28,499 --> 01:25:29,359
[SPEAKER_02]: Without fail.

1090
01:25:29,519 --> 01:25:31,141
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that's a fair, but you like dragons.

1091
01:25:31,781 --> 01:25:32,001
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1092
01:25:32,262 --> 01:25:32,502
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1093
01:25:32,962 --> 01:25:34,664
[SPEAKER_04]: Because dragons will smite my enemies for me.

1094
01:25:34,684 --> 01:25:36,105
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're not completely evil.

1095
01:25:37,126 --> 01:25:38,367
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I can see that in that part.

1096
01:25:38,447 --> 01:25:41,770
[SPEAKER_02]: I do get annoyed with popcorn kernels too, but I'll say, what is it, my weakness?

1097
01:25:41,810 --> 01:25:48,095
[SPEAKER_03]: And people at work who can't cook popcorn with a dam and end up making the whole building smell like burp popcorn.

1098
01:25:48,115 --> 01:25:49,677
[SPEAKER_07]: There's always, I love burnt popcorn.

1099
01:25:49,697 --> 01:25:50,517
[SPEAKER_07]: There's always the burnt.

1100
01:25:50,538 --> 01:25:52,239
[SPEAKER_07]: I purposefully burn my popcorn.

1101
01:25:52,479 --> 01:25:52,860
[SPEAKER_07]: Just a hair.

1102
01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:54,481
[SPEAKER_02]: See, you are the office apple, sir.

1103
01:25:54,501 --> 01:25:55,502
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, no, no, no.

1104
01:25:55,522 --> 01:25:56,683
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, at my old, at my job.

1105
01:25:56,703 --> 01:25:57,684
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just a tear, you know.

1106
01:25:58,084 --> 01:26:00,346
[SPEAKER_04]: My desk was like two rows from the break room.

1107
01:26:00,767 --> 01:26:03,269
[SPEAKER_04]: So it would smell like this burnt shit all the time.

1108
01:26:03,630 --> 01:26:04,951
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas I was perfect.

1109
01:26:07,053 --> 01:26:08,995
[SPEAKER_04]: And I had our crappy microwaves.

1110
01:26:09,276 --> 01:26:10,096
[SPEAKER_02]: You were perfect?

1111
01:26:11,278 --> 01:26:12,459
[SPEAKER_04]: As for popping popcorn at work.

1112
01:26:12,799 --> 01:26:20,988
[SPEAKER_04]: I had our crappy microwaves timed that I could always do the perfect container of popcorn with only a couple of kernels left at the bottom and nothing burnt.

1113
01:26:21,428 --> 01:26:41,654
[SPEAKER_07]: you have to understand that I follow the directions completely but I know when to pull it out so that it has you know when to pull out yes I know when to pull the popcorn out of the microwave oh you you adolescent you know how to pull it out when the explosion's just right

1114
01:26:43,123 --> 01:26:48,986
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, I don't want to singe anything in there, so... I have to make sure... With that dragon of yours.

1115
01:26:49,587 --> 01:26:55,830
[SPEAKER_07]: Because if you leave it in too long, it's just going to be waffle smoke all over the building.

1116
01:26:56,871 --> 01:26:58,472
[SPEAKER_07]: You just have to know when to take it out.

1117
01:26:58,512 --> 01:27:00,233
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it stinks all day.

1118
01:27:00,673 --> 01:27:01,173
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

1119
01:27:01,934 --> 01:27:05,416
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the clip I want them to play at the podcast awards.

1120
01:27:05,876 --> 01:27:08,838
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

1121
01:27:22,566 --> 01:27:24,947
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it doesn't smell too bad.

1122
01:27:25,288 --> 01:27:29,790
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, as gross as the story is and as non-video gaming related as the story is, I have to tell it.

1123
01:27:29,910 --> 01:27:31,591
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like kind of the opposite of you, Loki.

1124
01:27:31,631 --> 01:27:34,252
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, burnt popcorn, nah, not really a fan.

1125
01:27:34,532 --> 01:27:38,554
[SPEAKER_02]: But what I'm a total fan of and can't get enough of are like the barely popped kernels.

1126
01:27:39,055 --> 01:27:44,617
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the kernels that have popped a little bit, but are like not all the way popped.

1127
01:27:44,797 --> 01:27:47,419
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I will pull a microwave, I'll pull out early.

1128
01:27:47,439 --> 01:27:47,519
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1129
01:27:49,136 --> 01:27:56,104
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to get a bag full of those because those are the delicious kernels, in my opinion, are the ones that are barely popped.

1130
01:27:56,144 --> 01:27:58,006
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, they're also the worst for your teeth, but whatever.

1131
01:28:01,509 --> 01:28:04,613
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on to non-dragon related things.

1132
01:28:04,713 --> 01:28:09,217
[SPEAKER_07]: Only us can take a PopCap game and turn it into...

1133
01:28:11,929 --> 01:28:12,469
[SPEAKER_04]: Pulling out.

1134
01:28:13,890 --> 01:28:15,111
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, moving on.

1135
01:28:15,711 --> 01:28:17,673
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you hear these sounds in the background?

1136
01:28:18,353 --> 01:28:22,656
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the sounds of BurgerTime on Xbox Live Arcade.

1137
01:28:23,796 --> 01:28:25,677
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right, BurgerTime, Xbox Live Arcade.

1138
01:28:25,697 --> 01:28:26,378
[SPEAKER_02]: It has a release.

1139
01:28:26,498 --> 01:28:29,320
[SPEAKER_02]: It is November 2nd is when this is coming out.

1140
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:31,921
[SPEAKER_02]: And look, it's kind of an old OLR in-joke.

1141
01:28:32,061 --> 01:28:36,464
[SPEAKER_02]: It hasn't come up a lot lately, but I really defend the old arcade classic.

1142
01:28:36,504 --> 01:28:38,505
[SPEAKER_02]: BurgerTime is vastly underrated.

1143
01:28:38,585 --> 01:28:39,226
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great game.

1144
01:28:40,126 --> 01:28:52,050
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually, contrary to popular belief, I don't really believe it's the best arcade game ever made, but it's a fun one, and it's underrated, and I have to admit, this looks pretty cool, what they're doing with it, with the whole round platforms and the graphical upgrades.

1145
01:28:52,410 --> 01:28:55,791
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully it retains some of that charm of the original, and I'm really excited to try multiplayer.

1146
01:28:56,331 --> 01:29:02,113
[SPEAKER_02]: So I will get to do all that on November 2nd, because that's what the release date is, according to Monkeypaw Games, who's making it.

1147
01:29:03,573 --> 01:29:06,835
[SPEAKER_02]: Infinity Blade, of course, very popular game on the iOS platform.

1148
01:29:06,935 --> 01:29:07,735
[SPEAKER_02]: I have yet to play it.

1149
01:29:08,475 --> 01:29:09,596
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why I've been dodging it.

1150
01:29:09,616 --> 01:29:09,976
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all right.

1151
01:29:10,316 --> 01:29:11,277
[SPEAKER_02]: But very popular.

1152
01:29:12,157 --> 01:29:14,278
[SPEAKER_02]: It is actually going to be coming to arcades.

1153
01:29:15,058 --> 01:29:16,399
[SPEAKER_02]: That struck me as very interesting.

1154
01:29:16,439 --> 01:29:26,163
[SPEAKER_02]: But Infinity Blade FX is making its way to, I guess, Dave and Buster's and other types of facilities like that.

1155
01:29:26,244 --> 01:29:27,084
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of cool.

1156
01:29:27,104 --> 01:29:27,164
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

1157
01:29:27,304 --> 01:29:27,544
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura

1158
01:29:51,064 --> 01:29:51,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, let's do it.

1159
01:29:52,866 --> 01:29:53,786
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll make that sacrifice.

1160
01:29:54,267 --> 01:29:58,050
[SPEAKER_02]: By October 28th, so we'll have to go just after that to make sure that the game is there.

1161
01:29:58,330 --> 01:30:01,172
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I can finally play Infinity Blade, be it in arcade form.

1162
01:30:02,073 --> 01:30:05,896
[SPEAKER_02]: One other story before I turn it over to DarkSakura, and that has to do with Leisure Suit Larry.

1163
01:30:06,237 --> 01:30:07,678
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, look, before they ruined it,

1164
01:30:07,978 --> 01:30:11,400
[SPEAKER_02]: Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards is being remade.

1165
01:30:11,440 --> 01:30:12,681
[SPEAKER_02]: That is the original game in the series.

1166
01:30:12,701 --> 01:30:17,244
[SPEAKER_02]: They're remaking it with an HD upgrade for the series' 25th anniversary, which is coming up at the end of 2012.

1167
01:30:34,574 --> 01:30:35,094
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1168
01:30:53,590 --> 01:31:22,272
[SPEAKER_02]: it should be noted the games that came out within the past five years he had nothing to do with and in fact he was kind of a bitter Betty about him and I can't say I blame him in fact listen to this quote to EGM that he said quote I'm overjoyed to see Larry released from his digital dungeon after all this time and be placed in the hands of someone who understands him and wants to see him brought back to the forefront by people who love him and understand him that's that's what we call subtly throwing shade

1169
01:31:23,280 --> 01:31:24,422
[SPEAKER_04]: That's also a little redundant.

1170
01:31:25,042 --> 01:31:39,501
[SPEAKER_07]: A little bit, but... Well, you may remember that Legion Suit Larry before was released by Vividi Universal, who put out wonderful franchise-killing games like the Spyro series, the Crash series, and of course, the Legion Suit Larry series.

1171
01:31:41,089 --> 01:31:41,709
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1172
01:31:41,789 --> 01:31:43,529
[SPEAKER_07]: And guess who bought Vividi Universal?

1173
01:31:44,230 --> 01:31:44,790
[SPEAKER_07]: Activision.

1174
01:31:45,910 --> 01:31:47,270
[SPEAKER_07]: See where we're going here?

1175
01:31:47,430 --> 01:31:49,850
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they must have not optioned to continue this series.

1176
01:31:49,890 --> 01:31:51,871
[SPEAKER_02]: And after the last couple games, I can't imagine why.

1177
01:31:52,191 --> 01:31:53,431
[SPEAKER_02]: So now Replay Games picked it up.

1178
01:31:53,831 --> 01:32:01,152
[SPEAKER_02]: What's cool about this, Replay has said that if they're successful, they're going to keep doing these HD updates through all the original games.

1179
01:32:01,352 --> 01:32:02,833
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of rad.

1180
01:32:03,153 --> 01:32:04,693
[SPEAKER_02]: They're also planning on some new games.

1181
01:32:05,033 --> 01:32:07,573
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's just hope it doesn't suck.

1182
01:32:09,694 --> 01:32:10,494
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on, DarkSakra.

1183
01:32:11,750 --> 01:32:15,332
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, how about some stuff about the Nintendo DS?

1184
01:32:15,692 --> 01:32:16,652
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't want to hear it.

1185
01:32:17,933 --> 01:32:18,293
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1186
01:32:18,693 --> 01:32:26,897
[SPEAKER_04]: There has been over 50 million units sold in the US, and this was numbers presented by Nintendo.

1187
01:32:27,677 --> 01:32:33,419
[SPEAKER_04]: That's seven years post-launch, still selling, and like I said, 50 million units.

1188
01:32:33,439 --> 01:32:37,461
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder if that includes three DSs, because technically it's kind of part of the DS family.

1189
01:32:37,481 --> 01:32:38,582
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, and it's variants.

1190
01:32:38,742 --> 01:32:39,262
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, there you go.

1191
01:32:41,043 --> 01:32:47,088
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, for Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3, there is going to be a playable Galactus mode.

1192
01:32:48,229 --> 01:32:49,209
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty cool.

1193
01:32:49,950 --> 01:32:54,213
[SPEAKER_04]: You can just have him smack people with his bitch slap and his flick attack, I guess.

1194
01:32:54,834 --> 01:32:56,115
[SPEAKER_04]: You know who else I saw in there, by the way?

1195
01:32:56,835 --> 01:32:57,356
[SPEAKER_04]: Phoenix Wright.

1196
01:32:57,656 --> 01:32:58,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I heard about that too.

1197
01:32:58,977 --> 01:32:59,737
[SPEAKER_02]: Phoenix Wright's in it.

1198
01:33:00,458 --> 01:33:01,078
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty cool.

1199
01:33:02,900 --> 01:33:05,101
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it bad that I thought he was in the original one?

1200
01:33:05,222 --> 01:33:06,943
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not play the original one.

1201
01:33:06,963 --> 01:33:08,044
[SPEAKER_04]: They put in Frank West.

1202
01:33:09,008 --> 01:33:10,488
[SPEAKER_02]: Frank West, Star Wars, The Old Republic

1203
01:33:29,674 --> 01:33:30,615
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Rob Oh, Rob

1204
01:33:49,352 --> 01:33:53,835
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so let's get back into some more long-form news.

1205
01:33:54,256 --> 01:33:59,319
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, coming up later in the show, the mailbag at mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com is where you can always send us emails.

1206
01:33:59,900 --> 01:34:02,582
[SPEAKER_02]: And the FUs of the week coming up as well as Twitter topics.

1207
01:34:02,622 --> 01:34:09,887
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure you get those in because we will read Twitters while we're waiting for calls at twitter.com slash OLR.

1208
01:34:09,987 --> 01:34:10,928
[SPEAKER_02]: So get those all in right now.

1209
01:34:11,048 --> 01:34:11,208
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki.

1210
01:34:12,274 --> 01:34:26,423
[SPEAKER_07]: Unfortunately, you know, when you're a game studio that produces all the Harry Potter games for the movies and then the movie series ends, what's left for you than to just, you know, go under?

1211
01:34:27,243 --> 01:34:29,685
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually have an answer to that, but I'll let you finish the story.

1212
01:34:29,805 --> 01:34:30,045
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1213
01:34:31,666 --> 01:34:40,352
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently, Bright Light Studios is now under the formal consultation process and

1214
01:34:41,372 --> 01:34:50,577
[SPEAKER_07]: and basically the employees that are impacted will be considered for other positions at other EA studios including those in the UK.

1215
01:34:51,058 --> 01:34:57,842
[SPEAKER_07]: The UK is a vital center of game development for EA and we intend to maintain a strong presence there.

1216
01:34:58,602 --> 01:35:02,964
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, you know, the last few games that they put out kind of...

1217
01:35:04,693 --> 01:35:13,407
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, movie tie-in games don't have a high bar to hit, but even then they miss those, so maybe it's for the best.

1218
01:35:14,588 --> 01:35:14,968
[SPEAKER_07]: Harry Potter MMO

1219
01:35:37,864 --> 01:35:39,284
[SPEAKER_02]: I would not want them doing that.

1220
01:35:39,304 --> 01:35:41,725
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, and maybe this is for the best.

1221
01:35:41,905 --> 01:35:46,508
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like based on the games that they've made, and I've played some of these games, they're not that great.

1222
01:35:48,549 --> 01:35:54,391
[SPEAKER_02]: They should put it in more capable hands if they're going to do a Harry Potter MMO, but seriously, I'm not even that into the Harry Potter universe.

1223
01:35:54,551 --> 01:35:59,234
[SPEAKER_02]: I still haven't seen a single movie past the third movie, and I really haven't read the books.

1224
01:36:00,154 --> 01:36:04,496
[SPEAKER_02]: I would try this game in a heartbeat because that universe would just be fun.

1225
01:36:04,916 --> 01:36:06,237
[SPEAKER_02]: It's meant for a video game.

1226
01:36:06,717 --> 01:36:11,018
[SPEAKER_07]: Another game that they created that also was terrible, Create.

1227
01:36:11,779 --> 01:36:12,479
[SPEAKER_02]: What the hell is that?

1228
01:36:12,579 --> 01:36:15,380
[SPEAKER_07]: It was supposed to be a thing that was going to take on LittleBigPlanet.

1229
01:36:15,400 --> 01:36:16,200
[SPEAKER_07]: It came out last year.

1230
01:36:16,580 --> 01:36:17,461
[SPEAKER_07]: No one gave a shit.

1231
01:36:17,481 --> 01:36:18,541
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that the Xbox thing?

1232
01:36:18,681 --> 01:36:20,762
[SPEAKER_07]: It was Xbox, PlayStation 3, and Wii.

1233
01:36:20,782 --> 01:36:22,242
[SPEAKER_02]: It was terrible.

1234
01:36:22,562 --> 01:36:23,863
[SPEAKER_02]: What was Microsoft's answer to that?

1235
01:36:23,923 --> 01:36:24,743
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't they have something?

1236
01:36:24,883 --> 01:36:26,063
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that was also terrible.

1237
01:36:26,123 --> 01:36:28,084
[SPEAKER_07]: That ended up being an indie game thing, didn't it?

1238
01:36:29,085 --> 01:36:32,107
[SPEAKER_07]: I would really like to see an MMO come out of the Harry Potter universe, but it does need to be done right.

1239
01:36:32,127 --> 01:36:33,469
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't do a shitty MMO or people are going to be upset.

1240
01:36:55,157 --> 01:36:55,417
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1241
01:36:56,158 --> 01:36:57,119
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else before I move on?

1242
01:36:57,279 --> 01:36:59,381
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but it's a tangent, so I'm not going to go there right now.

1243
01:36:59,481 --> 01:36:59,722
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1244
01:36:59,762 --> 01:37:00,082
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not?

1245
01:37:00,142 --> 01:37:01,504
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to start another story, so go ahead.

1246
01:37:01,544 --> 01:37:02,144
[SPEAKER_02]: Go for the tangent.

1247
01:37:02,485 --> 01:37:09,351
[SPEAKER_07]: I forgot to mention, since it wasn't really my gaming week, and one of the reasons why I didn't play a lot of games this week, because I was reading Ready Player One.

1248
01:37:09,712 --> 01:37:10,773
[SPEAKER_07]: It's fucking amazing.

1249
01:37:11,053 --> 01:37:13,174
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, that was the book you were talking about last week, right?

1250
01:37:13,535 --> 01:37:14,055
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm serious.

1251
01:37:14,215 --> 01:37:16,216
[SPEAKER_07]: Any of our listeners for this show, this book is for you.

1252
01:37:16,396 --> 01:37:19,278
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's absolutely, without a doubt, for you.

1253
01:37:19,418 --> 01:37:20,259
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I get it on Kindle?

1254
01:37:20,879 --> 01:37:21,079
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1255
01:37:21,520 --> 01:37:23,021
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe I'll check it out.

1256
01:37:23,041 --> 01:37:27,664
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, I mean, not to spoil stuff, but like... Be careful.

1257
01:37:28,672 --> 01:37:30,993
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to spoil one thing, but it's kind of cool.

1258
01:37:31,113 --> 01:37:42,376
[SPEAKER_07]: The very first challenge that this guy has to go through to get this, because you have to find three keys and unlock three gates to find an Easter egg that basically gets you the assets of this company.

1259
01:37:42,497 --> 01:37:44,717
[SPEAKER_07]: This guy is like a multi-billion dollar thing.

1260
01:37:44,737 --> 01:37:47,598
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's a little bit like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory with the treasure hunt and stuff like that.

1261
01:37:49,059 --> 01:37:49,919
[SPEAKER_07]: He has to fight a lich.

1262
01:37:52,583 --> 01:37:53,844
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it the Lich King?

1263
01:37:53,884 --> 01:37:58,571
[SPEAKER_07]: He has to joust the Lich in the dungeon.

1264
01:37:58,952 --> 01:38:00,494
[SPEAKER_07]: It's some dungeon from Dungeons & Dragons.

1265
01:38:00,514 --> 01:38:01,656
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it the Lich from Shadowgate?

1266
01:38:02,277 --> 01:38:03,598
[SPEAKER_07]: Not the Lich from Shadowgate.

1267
01:38:03,919 --> 01:38:04,780
[SPEAKER_07]: But he has to fight him.

1268
01:38:05,241 --> 01:38:06,663
[SPEAKER_07]: He has to joust him.

1269
01:38:08,320 --> 01:38:09,701
[SPEAKER_07]: on the old arcade game Joust.

1270
01:38:09,901 --> 01:38:12,102
[SPEAKER_07]: I knew something was coming with that.

1271
01:38:12,302 --> 01:38:15,483
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just... Seriously, it's a fucking amazing book.

1272
01:38:15,523 --> 01:38:17,244
[SPEAKER_07]: You said this has been optioned for a movie, right?

1273
01:38:17,364 --> 01:38:18,504
[SPEAKER_07]: It has been optioned for a movie.

1274
01:38:18,584 --> 01:38:19,005
[SPEAKER_07]: Warner Bros.

1275
01:38:19,025 --> 01:38:20,005
[SPEAKER_07]: bought the rights last year.

1276
01:38:20,625 --> 01:38:21,166
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm serious.

1277
01:38:21,546 --> 01:38:23,587
[SPEAKER_07]: Go check this book out now.

1278
01:38:23,707 --> 01:38:24,487
[SPEAKER_07]: It's great.

1279
01:38:24,747 --> 01:38:24,887
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1280
01:38:25,007 --> 01:38:25,167
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1281
01:38:53,701 --> 01:38:54,803
[SPEAKER_02]: Scott Pilgrim vs. The World

1282
01:39:12,226 --> 01:39:12,786
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm serious.

1283
01:39:14,227 --> 01:39:15,688
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't read books a lot.

1284
01:39:15,828 --> 01:39:17,089
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, hardly ever.

1285
01:39:17,789 --> 01:39:19,310
[SPEAKER_07]: And I couldn't put the book down.

1286
01:39:19,370 --> 01:39:21,672
[SPEAKER_07]: I had to read the whole thing straight through until I finished it.

1287
01:39:21,932 --> 01:39:35,180
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's seriously, if you're a fan of the 80s stuff, if you're a fan of classic video games, if you're a fan of just cool, like kind of where's the internet going to go, that type of thing, you've got to read this.

1288
01:39:35,240 --> 01:39:35,921
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just amazing.

1289
01:39:36,801 --> 01:39:38,142
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's my tangent there.

1290
01:39:38,504 --> 01:39:38,784
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1291
01:39:39,505 --> 01:39:40,726
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on to some other news.

1292
01:39:41,306 --> 01:39:42,107
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, let me put it this way.

1293
01:39:42,447 --> 01:39:42,988
[SPEAKER_07]: No, you're done.

1294
01:39:43,068 --> 01:39:44,109
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, this is cool.

1295
01:39:44,870 --> 01:39:47,432
[SPEAKER_07]: The writer of this, he did a movie, Fanboys.

1296
01:39:47,792 --> 01:39:49,574
[SPEAKER_07]: He wrote the script and everything for that.

1297
01:39:49,634 --> 01:39:50,414
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, God, I've heard about it.

1298
01:39:50,434 --> 01:39:52,476
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I haven't seen that movie, but I know what it is.

1299
01:39:52,576 --> 01:39:54,518
[SPEAKER_07]: The guy, he drives around.

1300
01:39:55,838 --> 01:40:01,821
[SPEAKER_07]: And one of the cars, the avatar in this game, or this universe, drives around.

1301
01:40:01,881 --> 01:40:03,402
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not like a blue avatar.

1302
01:40:03,502 --> 01:40:06,344
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's this avatar in a virtual world type thing.

1303
01:40:07,244 --> 01:40:10,846
[SPEAKER_07]: He drives around, or flies around, I should say, and DeLorean...

1304
01:40:11,286 --> 01:40:14,609
[SPEAKER_07]: Night Rider, Night Rider, Night Rider, Night Rider

1305
01:40:36,966 --> 01:40:40,388
[SPEAKER_07]: Actdeft wants to know the name of the book Ready Player One The London Philharmonic Orchestra

1306
01:41:04,085 --> 01:41:06,546
[SPEAKER_02]: Super Mario, Angry Birds, Metal Gear Solid, Sons of Liberty, Fallout 3

1307
01:41:22,015 --> 01:41:22,335
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

1308
01:41:22,795 --> 01:41:24,516
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a sample available online.

1309
01:41:24,656 --> 01:41:33,760
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 theme, and they actually have a clip of it available on SoundCloud that you can check out under username kwall.

1310
01:41:34,060 --> 01:41:39,102
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me play a quick little clip here of this, if I can kind of skip ahead in the song here a little bit.

1311
01:41:44,485 --> 01:41:49,507
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't change the volume on this, but usually these classical songs are a little quieter anyway.

1312
01:41:51,300 --> 01:41:52,520
[SPEAKER_02]: You kind of get the feeling, right?

1313
01:41:52,560 --> 01:41:54,101
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.

1314
01:42:00,443 --> 01:42:02,624
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the London Philharmonic Orchestra doing that.

1315
01:42:02,644 --> 01:42:03,404
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's going to be awesome.

1316
01:42:05,745 --> 01:42:07,565
[SPEAKER_02]: Available wherever, like, you buy CDs.

1317
01:42:07,665 --> 01:42:09,446
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Amazon, iTunes, what have you.

1318
01:42:10,106 --> 01:42:10,326
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1319
01:42:10,726 --> 01:42:11,807
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go to the mailbag.

1320
01:42:11,887 --> 01:42:15,428
[SPEAKER_02]: Every week you guys send us emails at mailbag at orange lounge radio dot com.

1321
01:42:17,066 --> 01:42:19,327
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura is going to read some of her favorites right now.

1322
01:42:19,367 --> 01:42:20,787
[SPEAKER_02]: Mailbag at Orange Lounge Radio.

1323
01:42:20,987 --> 01:42:21,667
[SPEAKER_04]: All two of them.

1324
01:42:22,228 --> 01:42:22,728
[SPEAKER_02]: Two?

1325
01:42:22,988 --> 01:42:23,248
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

1326
01:42:24,008 --> 01:42:25,468
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm firing the listeners.

1327
01:42:26,649 --> 01:42:27,729
[SPEAKER_04]: First one comes from Ian.

1328
01:42:28,329 --> 01:42:31,590
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey guys, long time listener, first time, I don't know, emailer, whatever.

1329
01:42:32,050 --> 01:42:37,512
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure if you guys knew about this or not, but over the DSI Wear store, you can...

1330
01:42:39,073 --> 01:42:41,214
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess you can get the word get was left out.

1331
01:42:41,354 --> 01:42:44,176
[SPEAKER_04]: Legend of Zelda Four Swords Anniversary Edition for free.

1332
01:42:44,657 --> 01:42:45,137
[SPEAKER_04]: Hells yes.

1333
01:42:45,597 --> 01:42:47,659
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure when it runs out, but you better act fast.

1334
01:42:47,999 --> 01:42:49,200
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I have an answer for that.

1335
01:42:50,120 --> 01:42:51,021
[SPEAKER_02]: I was aware of that.

1336
01:42:51,081 --> 01:42:53,583
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty big news in the DS world if you're a 3DS owner.

1337
01:42:54,165 --> 01:43:19,049
[SPEAKER_02]: and absolutely, it's free you literally have no reason not to get it I haven't done it yet unless you don't have the 3DS February is when it will not be free anymore so it won't be free forever I don't have a 3DS the good news is, those of you that get them at the holidays which I imagine a lot of people are going to find 3DS's under their Hanukkah tree or whatever it is you'll be able to still get it through February

1338
01:43:21,058 --> 01:43:21,518
[SPEAKER_04]: Next email?

1339
01:43:21,999 --> 01:43:22,339
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not?

1340
01:43:23,499 --> 01:43:24,400
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, peoples.

1341
01:43:25,480 --> 01:43:27,622
[SPEAKER_04]: And this comes from Redertainment.

1342
01:43:28,042 --> 01:43:30,763
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a story that broke this week that just seemed to stick out in my mind.

1343
01:43:30,843 --> 01:43:32,024
[SPEAKER_04]: Why men are in trouble.

1344
01:43:32,564 --> 01:43:33,685
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I'm going to click this.

1345
01:43:34,425 --> 01:43:35,506
[SPEAKER_02]: Men are always in trouble.

1346
01:43:36,246 --> 01:43:37,567
[SPEAKER_02]: They won't man up.

1347
01:43:39,349 --> 01:43:39,649
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

1348
01:43:57,677 --> 01:44:02,700
[SPEAKER_04]: I tend not to pay attention to what you are currently saying or what you have said or will say in the future.

1349
01:44:02,801 --> 01:44:13,088
[SPEAKER_04]: So when William Bennett, President Obama, or my mom tells me to get off the video games five hours a week, get yourself together, get a challenging job, or get married, I tend to put that in the bottom of my to-do list.

1350
01:44:13,288 --> 01:44:14,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Stay black, Red Entertainment.

1351
01:44:14,349 --> 01:44:16,971
[SPEAKER_04]: This message was crafted while watching a news podcast on my Apple TV.

1352
01:44:17,411 --> 01:44:19,513
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just called having a rebellious nature.

1353
01:44:20,494 --> 01:44:22,295
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to do what someone tells you to do.

1354
01:44:22,615 --> 01:44:24,356
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone says do it, you want to do something else.

1355
01:44:24,577 --> 01:44:26,438
[SPEAKER_02]: That's actually very common.

1356
01:44:26,698 --> 01:44:29,401
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people kind of have that rebellious nature, right?

1357
01:44:30,462 --> 01:44:34,986
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm just kind of glancing this over and... Is this an opinion piece?

1358
01:44:35,026 --> 01:44:35,607
[SPEAKER_04]: I noticed it's on CNN.

1359
01:44:35,627 --> 01:44:37,549
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think it's an opinion piece.

1360
01:44:38,050 --> 01:44:38,530
[SPEAKER_02]: By a dude.

1361
01:44:38,930 --> 01:44:39,231
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.

1362
01:44:39,371 --> 01:44:41,153
[SPEAKER_02]: It's by a guy here.

1363
01:44:42,194 --> 01:44:42,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't care.

1364
01:44:44,420 --> 01:44:44,961
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for your email.

1365
01:44:45,021 --> 01:44:46,702
[SPEAKER_02]: I was trying to read over your shoulder.

1366
01:44:46,782 --> 01:44:48,804
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you can get in the email and read it yourself.

1367
01:44:48,824 --> 01:44:49,825
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll read it and be more educated.

1368
01:44:49,865 --> 01:44:52,128
[SPEAKER_03]: Do I look like your correspondent?

1369
01:44:52,168 --> 01:44:53,289
[SPEAKER_02]: Now who's nagging?

1370
01:44:54,090 --> 01:44:55,151
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not nagging.

1371
01:44:56,252 --> 01:44:59,295
[SPEAKER_07]: It's written by a guy who's literally from the Middle Ages.

1372
01:44:59,755 --> 01:45:00,556
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you read it?

1373
01:45:00,796 --> 01:45:02,198
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he's super different.

1374
01:45:02,238 --> 01:45:04,220
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank God someone's educated on this program.

1375
01:45:04,680 --> 01:45:08,701
[SPEAKER_07]: He's so fucking old and he just, like, he complains about all this stuff.

1376
01:45:08,841 --> 01:45:10,161
[SPEAKER_07]: Back in my day!

1377
01:45:10,901 --> 01:45:13,882
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I actually put a comment on my Facebook when I linked the article.

1378
01:45:13,942 --> 01:45:18,223
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, yeah, this article's missing a lot of back in my day and get off my lawn.

1379
01:45:18,243 --> 01:45:20,983
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, because seriously, that is what this is complaining about.

1380
01:45:21,303 --> 01:45:22,064
[SPEAKER_07]: They need a man up.

1381
01:45:22,224 --> 01:45:26,444
[SPEAKER_07]: Those people need to go into the military and fight for their country and blah, blah, blah.

1382
01:45:26,484 --> 01:45:31,485
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what the problem with people is they sit at home and play their Xbox instead of getting a job.

1383
01:45:32,046 --> 01:45:33,446
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, oh, my God.

1384
01:45:33,526 --> 01:45:34,166
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, seriously...

1385
01:45:34,426 --> 01:45:35,847
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, well, how about this?

1386
01:45:36,187 --> 01:45:37,228
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I'm going to put it this way.

1387
01:45:37,248 --> 01:45:38,469
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's use a military angle.

1388
01:45:39,109 --> 01:45:44,492
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, would you go to work for a place that you knew was in debt and charging more debt?

1389
01:45:46,934 --> 01:45:48,015
[SPEAKER_02]: This is going to get political.

1390
01:45:48,035 --> 01:45:49,335
[SPEAKER_02]: I already know where you're going with this.

1391
01:45:49,355 --> 01:45:50,216
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm just saying, would you?

1392
01:45:51,017 --> 01:45:53,118
[SPEAKER_02]: If they offered a great retirement plan, I might.

1393
01:45:54,539 --> 01:45:55,179
[SPEAKER_02]: Touché.

1394
01:45:55,199 --> 01:45:56,260
[SPEAKER_02]: Their debt is not out.

1395
01:45:56,640 --> 01:46:02,064
[SPEAKER_04]: However, if the company was in debt and started laying off people before you could retire...

1396
01:46:03,184 --> 01:46:23,598
[SPEAKER_04]: I would, I think logically any profession you go into you would think about the longevity of your job, absolutely So then why would it be a good idea then to go into the military when the entire, the last couple of wars have been waged on a visa He's one of the people that's wrong with the problem, he's probably one of the 1% too

1397
01:46:25,353 --> 01:46:32,295
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to say anything negative about people that choose to go into the military because it's a thankless job that not everybody's brave enough to do.

1398
01:46:32,315 --> 01:46:33,355
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that wasn't my point.

1399
01:46:33,435 --> 01:46:34,916
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm saying in response to this guy.

1400
01:46:35,396 --> 01:46:35,656
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1401
01:46:35,796 --> 01:46:39,957
[SPEAKER_04]: What makes it attractive... Now, I understand going in for patriarchy.

1402
01:46:39,997 --> 01:46:40,557
[SPEAKER_04]: That's one thing.

1403
01:46:41,118 --> 01:46:43,638
[SPEAKER_04]: Or going in because it's a good option right now.

1404
01:46:44,078 --> 01:46:49,380
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of a good... To be fair, it's a really good substitute for school.

1405
01:46:50,327 --> 01:47:17,793
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that sounds like really fucked up but it's like that real world experience because people do a lot in the military I even considered going into the reserves for the Air Force but the whole thing is that he's bringing this up but what he's not looking at is that is there really going to be a future for more people involved if they can't afford to pay the people involved if we're charging up more debt I think that this guy is one of the old school who's part of the problem

1406
01:47:19,277 --> 01:47:21,238
[SPEAKER_07]: You make it sound like, though, that we're paying back the debt.

1407
01:47:22,598 --> 01:47:26,959
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, we can borrow as much money as we want.

1408
01:47:26,979 --> 01:47:27,599
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the problem.

1409
01:47:28,120 --> 01:47:30,960
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not paying for the debt because we're not having a raise in taxes.

1410
01:47:32,121 --> 01:47:32,921
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not rationing.

1411
01:47:32,941 --> 01:47:34,941
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not doing any of the stuff that they've done in past wars.

1412
01:47:35,682 --> 01:47:37,562
[SPEAKER_02]: This world's going to hell in a handbasket.

1413
01:47:37,922 --> 01:47:44,004
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet you anything would have more jobs if we were actually working to fund the stuff ourselves and not outsourcing everything.

1414
01:47:44,437 --> 01:47:46,319
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's a whole nother Oprah.

1415
01:47:46,339 --> 01:47:49,422
[SPEAKER_07]: I wasn't literally saying though that he was telling people to go into the military.

1416
01:47:49,462 --> 01:47:54,106
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just saying that he's, you know, of the mind of like old, old, old people.

1417
01:47:54,146 --> 01:47:55,267
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that mindset though.

1418
01:47:55,847 --> 01:47:56,888
[SPEAKER_07]: Just like very stubborn.

1419
01:47:56,928 --> 01:47:58,209
[SPEAKER_07]: He thinks, oh, it's a new thing.

1420
01:47:58,289 --> 01:47:59,991
[SPEAKER_07]: Therefore, it's the cause of all problems.

1421
01:48:00,051 --> 01:48:07,037
[SPEAKER_07]: If it wasn't the comic books, the rock music, the drugs and more rock music, I mean, or maybe rap music.

1422
01:48:07,057 --> 01:48:07,458
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1423
01:48:08,699 --> 01:48:08,839
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1424
01:48:10,265 --> 01:48:29,860
[SPEAKER_02]: Wasn't it, and I'm going to horribly misappropriate this quote and hopefully not disrespect somebody who recently deceased, but wasn't it even Steve Jobs who said something about like drugs was one of something that really like the one time he did it was kind of like a life changing thing, not necessarily in like a negative way, but that it was something that

1425
01:48:31,790 --> 01:48:33,071
[SPEAKER_02]: I should have opened this box.

1426
01:48:33,591 --> 01:48:37,794
[SPEAKER_04]: I tell you what, we would be missing several classic... Not that I'm condoning drugs.

1427
01:48:37,914 --> 01:48:38,014
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1428
01:48:38,054 --> 01:48:40,536
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not condoning drugs, but I'm just saying, you know.

1429
01:48:40,756 --> 01:48:45,659
[SPEAKER_04]: But keep in mind, think of how many classic masterpieces would be missing if not for Absinthe.

1430
01:48:46,209 --> 01:48:51,713
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes people who are a little rebellious cause us to think a little bit differently.

1431
01:48:51,893 --> 01:48:53,114
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that's really my point.

1432
01:48:54,315 --> 01:48:54,996
[SPEAKER_04]: That's exactly it.

1433
01:48:55,036 --> 01:48:55,996
[SPEAKER_02]: Think different, right?

1434
01:48:56,377 --> 01:48:56,737
[SPEAKER_02]: Touche.

1435
01:48:56,957 --> 01:48:59,679
[SPEAKER_04]: Except that's bad grammar and I can't quote that.

1436
01:49:00,019 --> 01:49:00,400
[SPEAKER_02]: Shush.

1437
01:49:00,480 --> 01:49:00,780
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1438
01:49:01,440 --> 01:49:01,901
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on.

1439
01:49:03,104 --> 01:49:03,985
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it for the mailbag, huh?

1440
01:49:04,426 --> 01:49:04,726
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

1441
01:49:04,807 --> 01:49:05,367
[SPEAKER_02]: I said just two.

1442
01:49:05,608 --> 01:49:09,353
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess this will be a... Well, I wasn't listening because all I was hearing was nagging.

1443
01:49:11,056 --> 01:49:11,336
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob!

1444
01:49:11,857 --> 01:49:12,037
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob!

1445
01:49:12,538 --> 01:49:12,738
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob!

1446
01:49:13,179 --> 01:49:15,522
[SPEAKER_02]: What a good opportunity to go to the F-U's of the week.

1447
01:49:15,542 --> 01:49:15,622
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

1448
01:49:35,760 --> 01:49:57,334
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that my FU of the week is going to be something a little bit less, I don't know, it's the whole job thing, you know, it's kind of getting on me and the whole marketing is really coming back to, it's really, and I told you guys before the show, but it's really playing a personal role in my life and

1449
01:49:58,920 --> 01:50:16,139
[SPEAKER_04]: It's ridiculous, and I really want to give a big F you to people who try to argue against something that they don't believe in by using fallacious arguments, like number one.

1450
01:50:16,620 --> 01:50:18,162
[SPEAKER_02]: But using fallatio is okay.

1451
01:50:18,262 --> 01:50:18,762
[SPEAKER_04]: That's fine.

1452
01:50:19,983 --> 01:50:20,783
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know what I mean.

1453
01:50:21,104 --> 01:50:27,246
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, trying to discredit the person talking about something by saying that, you know, by trying to insult them.

1454
01:50:27,906 --> 01:50:36,229
[SPEAKER_04]: Or by using, you know, sensationalist words or trying to show that, you know, an issue is skyrocketing.

1455
01:50:36,269 --> 01:50:42,331
[SPEAKER_04]: Or throwing someone off the path to try to make themselves seem like they know what the hell they're talking about when they really don't.

1456
01:50:43,924 --> 01:50:53,671
[SPEAKER_04]: If you feel a certain way just because you feel that way, or you have an opinion based on a feeling, just say that.

1457
01:50:53,731 --> 01:50:58,855
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you don't have facts to support it, don't inject your shit where you don't know what the fuck you're talking about.

1458
01:50:59,636 --> 01:50:59,956
[SPEAKER_04]: The end.

1459
01:51:02,037 --> 01:51:02,418
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki!

1460
01:51:03,570 --> 01:51:12,018
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck you to being invited to the Saints Row Hollywood pre-launch event the day before it happens.

1461
01:51:12,199 --> 01:51:21,588
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, it's just kind of hard to justify paying $400 for a goddamn ticket or driving a total of like 12 hours to and back from L.A.

1462
01:51:21,948 --> 01:51:23,650
[SPEAKER_07]: to go play Saints Row for three hours.

1463
01:51:23,670 --> 01:51:24,551
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have been in the car.

1464
01:51:26,278 --> 01:51:27,099
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, Loki.

1465
01:51:27,299 --> 01:51:29,120
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but see, I have a wife to contend with as well.

1466
01:51:29,140 --> 01:51:30,241
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's true, that's true.

1467
01:51:30,521 --> 01:51:33,363
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, hey, if they were going to fly me down or something like that, that's cool.

1468
01:51:33,623 --> 01:51:34,543
[SPEAKER_07]: But, see, here's the thing.

1469
01:51:34,603 --> 01:51:48,512
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, not that I would really want to rub elbows with, you know, Lindsay Lohan or anything like that down there, but they had a bunch of people, you know, all the photos are people, you know, taking in the free alcohol and taking pictures and dancing and stuff like that.

1470
01:51:48,532 --> 01:51:50,354
[SPEAKER_07]: But no one fucking playing the goddamn game.

1471
01:51:50,454 --> 01:51:53,155
[SPEAKER_07]: It was like, goddammit, they're playing the game.

1472
01:51:54,856 --> 01:51:55,096
[SPEAKER_07]: Outro Music

1473
01:52:13,622 --> 01:52:18,785
[SPEAKER_07]: They had one of the Kardashians or something there, but not any of the famous ones or something.

1474
01:52:19,205 --> 01:52:21,967
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't remember who it was, like Rob Kardashian or something.

1475
01:52:21,987 --> 01:52:24,008
[SPEAKER_07]: Isn't he the one that's on Dancing with the Stars?

1476
01:52:24,208 --> 01:52:24,888
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, who was?

1477
01:52:24,928 --> 01:52:25,949
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know who the fuck he is.

1478
01:52:26,369 --> 01:52:30,031
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, it's just like all these people, like, I wouldn't know who the hell they are.

1479
01:52:30,411 --> 01:52:34,973
[SPEAKER_07]: And then they're like, so, but my guy at THQ is awesome, though, for at least sending me the invite.

1480
01:52:35,013 --> 01:52:37,434
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I was like, he's like, I just found out about this yesterday.

1481
01:52:37,454 --> 01:52:37,935
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like...

1482
01:52:39,127 --> 01:52:39,928
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

1483
01:52:58,471 --> 01:53:01,072
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I would have... Alan would be like, can you take me with you?

1484
01:53:01,892 --> 01:53:07,374
[SPEAKER_07]: I seriously... Well, the only reason I know it's $400 is because I looked at the prices and tickets and it just... It was not going to happen.

1485
01:53:07,934 --> 01:53:11,695
[SPEAKER_07]: Even if I was able to pay for that, the flights just wouldn't... You got a family to think about now.

1486
01:53:11,715 --> 01:53:18,577
[SPEAKER_07]: And the flights just didn't jive and you would have had... I would have to drive 12 hours to play out three hours worth of a game that's coming out in a few weeks.

1487
01:53:18,697 --> 01:53:18,937
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean...

1488
01:53:20,457 --> 01:53:25,023
[SPEAKER_07]: I would normally do that if I had no restrictions, but I don't make enough for $400.

1489
01:53:25,224 --> 01:53:26,565
[SPEAKER_07]: I can just blow away.

1490
01:53:30,896 --> 01:53:31,457
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, fair enough.

1491
01:53:32,177 --> 01:53:34,760
[SPEAKER_02]: My FU of the week, I don't have a lot of serious stuff.

1492
01:53:34,860 --> 01:53:37,002
[SPEAKER_02]: Things are going relatively well, all things considered.

1493
01:53:37,102 --> 01:53:41,827
[SPEAKER_02]: So, FU to, I would say FU to the traffic up in Apple Hill yesterday.

1494
01:53:42,888 --> 01:53:45,971
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, and the fact that all of the roads up there are only one lane with stop signs.

1495
01:53:46,031 --> 01:53:51,817
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I get that it's supposed to be all rural and country, but there comes a point where you just admit you need to build a better off-ramp.

1496
01:53:53,991 --> 01:53:54,412
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

1497
01:53:55,314 --> 01:53:58,180
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on to a couple more news stories for you guys.

1498
01:53:58,200 --> 01:54:01,166
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, of course, Twitter topics and the Skype line very, very soon.

1499
01:54:01,226 --> 01:54:01,447
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki.

1500
01:54:02,057 --> 01:54:03,137
[SPEAKER_07]: This is kind of exciting.

1501
01:54:03,498 --> 01:54:04,858
[SPEAKER_07]: Not in the way you probably think, though.

1502
01:54:05,418 --> 01:54:08,860
[SPEAKER_07]: Grand Theft Auto 3 is having its 10th anniversary.

1503
01:54:09,400 --> 01:54:13,901
[SPEAKER_07]: So Rockstar is celebrating by porting it to the iOS platform.

1504
01:54:14,522 --> 01:54:17,143
[SPEAKER_07]: This would actually be the new iOS stuff.

1505
01:54:17,203 --> 01:54:22,544
[SPEAKER_07]: The iPad 2 and iPhone 4S are going to be the only devices that are supporting it, at least on the Apple end.

1506
01:54:22,705 --> 01:54:24,285
[SPEAKER_07]: Android phones are also getting it.

1507
01:54:24,565 --> 01:54:26,266
[SPEAKER_07]: DroidX 2, HTC, Evo 2.

1508
01:54:27,106 --> 01:54:39,891
[SPEAKER_07]: LG Optimus 2X, Motorola Atrix, and Samsung Galaxy S2, as well as Android tablets Acer, Icona, the Asus E-Pad, Motorola Zoom, and Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1.

1509
01:54:42,492 --> 01:54:45,554
[SPEAKER_07]: So that game's going to be ported there in HD graphics and stuff like that.

1510
01:54:45,574 --> 01:54:50,056
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, some unique gameplay stuff there, but I don't know.

1511
01:54:50,096 --> 01:54:52,336
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it'd be pretty hard to play on a system.

1512
01:54:52,557 --> 01:54:55,458
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just excited about the fact that they're doing that because that means that

1513
01:54:56,338 --> 01:55:00,460
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, sooner or later this is coming to Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation.

1514
01:55:00,520 --> 01:55:01,840
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, come on.

1515
01:55:01,860 --> 01:55:03,081
[SPEAKER_07]: They're putting in the work to do it now.

1516
01:55:03,421 --> 01:55:04,181
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to do it.

1517
01:55:04,521 --> 01:55:07,583
[SPEAKER_07]: And once this comes, then Vice City and then San Andreas.

1518
01:55:07,623 --> 01:55:08,703
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's just going to be amazing.

1519
01:55:10,064 --> 01:55:19,948
[SPEAKER_07]: One other ridiculous thing, though, that they're having is they're having a 1.6 scale action figure you can buy of Claude from the hero, I guess, of the first game.

1520
01:55:20,428 --> 01:55:23,309
[SPEAKER_07]: And, of course, comes with outfits and guns and stuff like that for $150.

1521
01:55:23,349 --> 01:55:23,409
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

1522
01:55:25,710 --> 01:55:32,860
[SPEAKER_07]: Not worth it, but if you're a really big fan, and I'm a huge fan of Grand Theft Auto, but I'm not paying $150 for a fucking toy.

1523
01:55:33,741 --> 01:55:33,881
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1524
01:55:36,504 --> 01:55:36,684
[SPEAKER_07]: So.

1525
01:55:37,806 --> 01:55:38,046
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh well.

1526
01:55:38,787 --> 01:55:39,348
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks neat though.

1527
01:55:41,995 --> 01:55:42,736
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, yeah.

1528
01:55:44,317 --> 01:55:48,119
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess any extra money they can get out of that franchise, they will, right?

1529
01:55:49,160 --> 01:55:49,660
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

1530
01:55:50,841 --> 01:55:52,742
[SPEAKER_07]: I would love to play the game.

1531
01:55:52,782 --> 01:56:00,627
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently, though, they're going to be porting the game later on to other platforms, you know, like just the regular iPhone 4 and stuff like that, but it's not going to be as pretty.

1532
01:56:03,008 --> 01:56:10,653
[SPEAKER_07]: And I do think that it does support some of the Bluetooth controllers and stuff like that, so that would be kind of cool to actually play with buttons, but

1533
01:56:11,254 --> 01:56:13,758
[SPEAKER_07]: I really just wanted to come to Xbox Live Arcade.

1534
01:56:13,898 --> 01:56:16,121
[SPEAKER_07]: Really, I would just say skip 3 and Vice City.

1535
01:56:17,183 --> 01:56:18,245
[SPEAKER_07]: Just bring San Andreas.

1536
01:56:18,565 --> 01:56:19,547
[SPEAKER_07]: San Andreas is multiplayer.

1537
01:56:19,707 --> 01:56:21,971
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't even need to put out Grand Theft Auto 5 anytime soon.

1538
01:56:22,572 --> 01:56:23,453
[SPEAKER_07]: People would eat that up.

1539
01:56:24,775 --> 01:56:25,076
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1540
01:56:26,076 --> 01:56:29,057
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on to Apple-related news, other iOS news.

1541
01:56:29,537 --> 01:56:36,180
[SPEAKER_02]: This has to do with Game Center, which got some minor upgrades in the whole iOS 5 thing, but nothing really to scream about.

1542
01:56:36,260 --> 01:56:41,602
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, yay, it shows you your total achievement points now in comparison to others, and you can have your own little picture.

1543
01:56:41,702 --> 01:56:42,022
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoopee!

1544
01:56:42,702 --> 01:57:06,452
[SPEAKER_02]: But you gotta wonder if maybe there was other stuff that was supposed to come Because some patents that Apple had filed was talking about avatars Little avatars on game centers, you know, where you could have little hats and hair Pretty much the exact same thing, you know, with the Xbox avatars and the Miis on the Wii That is apparently something that Apple was or is looking at for game center The patents were originally filed in April

1545
01:57:07,412 --> 01:57:09,434
[SPEAKER_02]: But obviously we didn't see this in iOS 5.

1546
01:57:09,494 --> 01:57:11,715
[SPEAKER_02]: So either it was scrapped or who knows.

1547
01:57:12,416 --> 01:57:16,899
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't those remind me of the little figures or the characters from Tiny Tower?

1548
01:57:18,360 --> 01:57:19,000
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, kind of.

1549
01:57:19,040 --> 01:57:21,382
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because Tiny Tower kind of has that thing going on with it.

1550
01:57:21,442 --> 01:57:26,486
[SPEAKER_02]: But I got to say, honestly, this is just, okay, it's just another version of the me.

1551
01:57:26,966 --> 01:57:27,947
[SPEAKER_02]: Avatar is somewhere else.

1552
01:57:27,987 --> 01:57:28,327
[SPEAKER_02]: Woo-hoo.

1553
01:57:29,008 --> 01:57:30,209
[SPEAKER_02]: So whatever.

1554
01:57:30,269 --> 01:57:31,329
[SPEAKER_02]: Game Center is kind of a...

1555
01:57:32,489 --> 01:57:35,812
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, there's just not a lot to get excited about with Game Center.

1556
01:57:35,912 --> 01:57:48,022
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I get that Apple's kind of trying to standardize things, but you look at what's going on with things like OpenFaint, and you're kind of like, wow, they seem to be pushing the envelope a lot faster and doing other exciting things with it.

1557
01:57:48,062 --> 01:57:58,872
[SPEAKER_02]: But the problem with OpenFaint is that because it's not tied into the iOS, it kind of sometimes can get in the way and is distracting, and a lot of games really push it when you're like, you know what, I'm not interested in all that.

1558
01:57:59,412 --> 01:58:06,198
[SPEAKER_02]: so, I don't know this is something I've noticed amongst my iOS gaming alright, DarkSakura, what do you got for us?

1559
01:58:07,321 --> 01:58:08,381
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a few things.

1560
01:58:08,481 --> 01:58:11,683
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, really just one thing, but it has to do with EVE Online.

1561
01:58:12,523 --> 01:58:19,105
[SPEAKER_04]: There is an offer going out for lapsed EVE Online users to save money.

1562
01:58:19,165 --> 01:58:26,508
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically, if they reactivate their account, they pay $4.95 for 30 days instead of $14.95.

1563
01:58:28,409 --> 01:58:32,650
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess it's just to get people back in for that month and see if it keeps them hooked.

1564
01:58:35,552 --> 01:58:36,512
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very interesting.

1565
01:58:37,881 --> 01:58:51,308
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm sure when there's all these other MMOs going on, you know, and of course launches coming up like Star Wars and so forth, you know, these aging MMOs have to do everything they can to kind of get people to look at it again, you know?

1566
01:58:51,748 --> 01:58:51,988
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

1567
01:58:52,128 --> 01:58:56,330
[SPEAKER_02]: But of course, EVE has that whole spinoff coming to the PlayStation 3 they were talking about at E3.

1568
01:58:56,431 --> 01:58:56,911
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.

1569
01:58:57,091 --> 01:59:01,013
[SPEAKER_02]: So that right there is probably going to get a lot of people kind of looking back at EVE, I'm sure.

1570
01:59:01,373 --> 01:59:01,753
[SPEAKER_04]: Possibly.

1571
01:59:02,113 --> 01:59:02,274
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1572
01:59:02,794 --> 01:59:02,874
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

1573
01:59:03,464 --> 01:59:21,947
[SPEAKER_07]: So Sony is apparently looking for, or possibly mulling around if you will, an idea where people can actually get a discount on purchasing UMD games on the Vita if you currently own the actual UMD game.

1574
01:59:22,667 --> 01:59:29,313
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is coming from the Japanese language fact that's posted, I guess, on Sony's PlayStation website.

1575
01:59:29,753 --> 01:59:38,460
[SPEAKER_07]: They're saying that the fact notes that they're considering a service to offer PSN versions of UMD games users own for a special price.

1576
01:59:38,500 --> 01:59:42,823
[SPEAKER_07]: This isn't a confirmation, obviously, but it's something that they're considering.

1577
01:59:42,883 --> 01:59:44,845
[SPEAKER_07]: Details of the service will be announced later.

1578
01:59:45,185 --> 01:59:50,109
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know how the hell they're going to be able to do that, but maybe you have to pop it in your PSP and...

1579
01:59:50,726 --> 01:59:52,695
[SPEAKER_07]: It recognizes it's there, something like that.

1580
01:59:53,799 --> 01:59:55,406
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know how that really works.

1581
01:59:57,133 --> 02:00:26,476
[SPEAKER_07]: yeah it says I guess also it says that the Vita will play all downloadable PSP games except for game archives which I guess is the Japanese label for the PlayStation 1 classics Neo Geo games and retro downloads so you're not going to be able to play your PlayStation 1 games I guess but maybe they're going to have a different way to play them later on or something oh well that's too bad

1582
02:00:28,431 --> 02:00:29,474
[SPEAKER_02]: Not surprising, though.

1583
02:00:29,955 --> 02:00:32,481
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's hard to support all this backwards, you know?

1584
02:00:32,601 --> 02:00:35,889
[SPEAKER_02]: It's akin to the whole PlayStation 2 games that are now showing up on PlayStation 3.

1585
02:00:36,370 --> 02:00:37,051
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I don't know.

1586
02:00:37,172 --> 02:00:38,154
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of what it reminds me of.

1587
02:00:39,414 --> 02:00:40,435
[SPEAKER_02]: South Park, Tenorman's Revenge

1588
02:01:08,530 --> 02:01:09,850
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you remember Scott Tenorman?

1589
02:01:10,110 --> 02:01:16,392
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the character where his parents were chopped up and Cartman fed the parents into chili to Scott Tenorman.

1590
02:01:16,412 --> 02:01:20,193
[SPEAKER_02]: That was one of the most fucked up episodes of South Park that there was.

1591
02:01:20,233 --> 02:01:22,353
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it was a play on Titus, right?

1592
02:01:22,933 --> 02:01:25,754
[SPEAKER_02]: One of those movies that had come out around the same time.

1593
02:01:26,334 --> 02:01:29,715
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was one of those so sick it was funny.

1594
02:01:29,955 --> 02:01:30,195
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1595
02:01:30,415 --> 02:01:30,575
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

1596
02:01:31,895 --> 02:01:38,580
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, I guess it was being shown at Comic-Con and some screenshots have come out of it.

1597
02:01:39,541 --> 02:01:41,382
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like it might be a little more of a platformer.

1598
02:01:41,402 --> 02:01:42,483
[SPEAKER_07]: They have a trailer for it.

1599
02:01:42,523 --> 02:01:43,624
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually pretty cool looking.

1600
02:01:43,744 --> 02:01:44,945
[SPEAKER_07]: And ManBearPig is in it.

1601
02:01:45,185 --> 02:01:45,846
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, is there a trailer?

1602
02:01:45,966 --> 02:01:46,866
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a trailer for it.

1603
02:01:47,026 --> 02:01:50,929
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me find it.

1604
02:01:50,949 --> 02:01:51,830
[SPEAKER_07]: It is pretty cool looking.

1605
02:01:51,890 --> 02:01:55,253
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks like a four-player side-scroller game.

1606
02:01:55,713 --> 02:01:56,333
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, here we go.

1607
02:01:56,934 --> 02:01:57,774
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a trailer here.

1608
02:01:57,915 --> 02:01:58,495
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's take a look.

1609
02:02:07,065 --> 02:02:08,406
[SPEAKER_10]: Is he building a robot?

1610
02:02:08,466 --> 02:02:08,986
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I get it.

1611
02:02:09,066 --> 02:02:12,328
[SPEAKER_10]: Begin ginger-vacation.

1612
02:02:12,408 --> 02:02:12,628
Nice.

1613
02:02:31,348 --> 02:02:32,229
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some gameplay.

1614
02:02:33,210 --> 02:02:35,233
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like it might be like four players simultaneous.

1615
02:02:35,593 --> 02:02:35,753
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1616
02:02:35,773 --> 02:02:36,975
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of what it looks like.

1617
02:02:36,995 --> 02:02:38,016
[SPEAKER_10]: You can play as the goon.

1618
02:02:38,036 --> 02:02:39,398
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been waiting a long time for this.

1619
02:02:41,127 --> 02:02:42,648
[SPEAKER_02]: That might be cute.

1620
02:02:43,088 --> 02:02:44,809
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of those South Park games are kind of dopey.

1621
02:02:45,590 --> 02:02:47,771
[SPEAKER_02]: God, there was one that was especially terrible.

1622
02:02:47,832 --> 02:02:48,592
[SPEAKER_02]: What was it on?

1623
02:02:48,632 --> 02:02:50,453
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to say it was on the Nintendo 64.

1624
02:02:51,034 --> 02:02:52,875
[SPEAKER_02]: The South Park kart racing game?

1625
02:02:53,515 --> 02:02:54,096
[SPEAKER_02]: Not even that.

1626
02:02:54,116 --> 02:02:55,036
[SPEAKER_02]: That was pretty bad too.

1627
02:02:55,096 --> 02:02:56,597
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a first person shooter game.

1628
02:02:56,737 --> 02:02:57,678
[SPEAKER_07]: It wasn't a kart racing game.

1629
02:02:57,778 --> 02:02:59,619
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a first person shooter.

1630
02:02:59,779 --> 02:03:01,060
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a special kind of terrible.

1631
02:03:02,561 --> 02:03:03,422
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember that.

1632
02:03:03,482 --> 02:03:05,383
[SPEAKER_02]: I played that.

1633
02:03:05,423 --> 02:03:06,244
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully it's better than that.

1634
02:03:08,806 --> 02:03:09,086
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1635
02:03:09,186 --> 02:03:13,687
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, even TigerClaw in our chatroom at chat.orange.com just brought that game up, the N64 game.

1636
02:03:13,727 --> 02:03:14,967
[SPEAKER_02]: And Ranma's like, I remember that.

1637
02:03:15,388 --> 02:03:17,228
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'd like to forget that that ever happened.

1638
02:03:17,288 --> 02:03:17,628
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.

1639
02:03:18,928 --> 02:03:19,188
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1640
02:03:19,248 --> 02:03:20,129
[SPEAKER_02]: Skyplane is open.

1641
02:03:20,149 --> 02:03:31,271
[SPEAKER_02]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio if you want to give us a call and talk about anything that we have talked about tonight so far on the show or maybe something that we missed that you were hoping we would talk about.

1642
02:03:31,571 --> 02:03:31,891
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1643
02:03:32,251 --> 02:03:34,172
[SPEAKER_02]: Meanwhile, going to some Twitter topics.

1644
02:03:35,432 --> 02:03:46,140
[SPEAKER_02]: Which I'm signed into the wrong account I was about to read tweets that were sent to me Not to the show Oh Rob, you're being a diva Are you reading my mother's Twitter?

1645
02:03:46,160 --> 02:03:46,200
[SPEAKER_02]: No

1646
02:03:51,286 --> 02:03:52,087
[SPEAKER_02]: Going to some tweets.

1647
02:03:52,107 --> 02:03:53,988
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a couple tweets here from Tigerclaw305.

1648
02:03:54,048 --> 02:03:58,871
[SPEAKER_02]: He always likes to tweet us some stories that otherwise might slip through the cracks.

1649
02:03:59,232 --> 02:04:02,033
[SPEAKER_02]: The first one that he tweeted us is about a Spider-Man video game.

1650
02:04:02,093 --> 02:04:04,375
[SPEAKER_02]: The amazing Spider-Man video game coming in 2012.

1651
02:04:05,276 --> 02:04:06,536
[SPEAKER_02]: It's supposed to be open world.

1652
02:04:06,917 --> 02:04:09,438
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess there's teaser posters all over New York Comic Con about it.

1653
02:04:10,099 --> 02:04:14,642
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously the new movie, because they're rebooting the franchise that wasn't that dead.

1654
02:04:14,682 --> 02:04:16,243
[SPEAKER_02]: But whatever, they're rebooting it in 2012.

1655
02:04:17,063 --> 02:04:17,944
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's on its way.

1656
02:04:18,064 --> 02:04:19,265
[SPEAKER_02]: They also have a trailer for that too.

1657
02:04:19,825 --> 02:04:20,325
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there really?

1658
02:04:20,385 --> 02:04:22,906
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me see if we can find... Well, hold on, because we're getting a call.

1659
02:04:23,126 --> 02:04:28,247
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll look for a trailer for this while we take our call, but we do have a call coming in, so let's go do it.

1660
02:04:28,567 --> 02:04:29,487
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1661
02:04:29,507 --> 02:04:29,827
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's this?

1662
02:04:30,407 --> 02:04:32,608
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, it's DJ Ranma S from Anime Jam Session.

1663
02:04:32,708 --> 02:04:33,788
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you guys doing tonight?

1664
02:04:33,808 --> 02:04:35,408
[SPEAKER_02]: I am fantastic, Ranma.

1665
02:04:35,488 --> 02:04:36,169
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you doing?

1666
02:04:37,429 --> 02:04:38,409
[SPEAKER_06]: I am tired.

1667
02:04:38,609 --> 02:04:44,750
[SPEAKER_06]: I am sitting here pouring over photos, pouring over videos, and sipping my spiked apple juice.

1668
02:04:45,371 --> 02:04:47,511
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, you were at New York Comic Con this weekend, right?

1669
02:04:48,055 --> 02:04:48,655
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I was.

1670
02:04:48,795 --> 02:04:49,456
[SPEAKER_06]: All four days.

1671
02:04:49,536 --> 02:04:51,177
[SPEAKER_02]: And are you working on your Fernando cosplay?

1672
02:04:52,858 --> 02:04:53,298
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1673
02:04:54,058 --> 02:04:55,459
[SPEAKER_06]: And screw you, Loki.

1674
02:04:55,779 --> 02:04:56,039
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1675
02:04:56,420 --> 02:04:56,760
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1676
02:04:57,080 --> 02:04:57,380
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1677
02:04:57,760 --> 02:04:58,040
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1678
02:04:59,361 --> 02:04:59,721
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1679
02:05:00,722 --> 02:05:01,842
[SPEAKER_02]: You know we just got to give you a hard time.

1680
02:05:02,863 --> 02:05:06,065
[SPEAKER_06]: Besides, I have a Buddha belly, so that ain't happening anytime soon.

1681
02:05:06,525 --> 02:05:06,865
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1682
02:05:06,885 --> 02:05:07,125
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1683
02:05:07,165 --> 02:05:08,466
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, how was the con?

1684
02:05:08,506 --> 02:05:08,986
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell us about it.

1685
02:05:09,006 --> 02:05:09,967
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, first, I got to ask.

1686
02:05:09,987 --> 02:05:10,387
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to ask.

1687
02:05:10,487 --> 02:05:11,808
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you play Bungie Ferret Tossing?

1688
02:05:12,608 --> 02:05:12,828
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1689
02:05:12,868 --> 02:05:13,509
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I did.

1690
02:05:13,529 --> 02:05:17,271
[SPEAKER_06]: And we do have a demo video up.

1691
02:05:18,140 --> 02:05:18,800
[SPEAKER_06]: Woohoo!

1692
02:05:19,221 --> 02:05:21,242
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just posted it in the chat room.

1693
02:05:21,302 --> 02:05:23,243
[SPEAKER_02]: Was this blessed by YYR?

1694
02:05:24,124 --> 02:05:24,984
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, yes it was.

1695
02:05:25,005 --> 02:05:25,805
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, just making sure.

1696
02:05:26,205 --> 02:05:28,827
[SPEAKER_06]: Plus, I am also press, so you know.

1697
02:05:29,607 --> 02:05:30,028
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I see.

1698
02:05:30,068 --> 02:05:30,668
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you're a press.

1699
02:05:30,748 --> 02:05:32,009
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, because you're out of my jam session.

1700
02:05:33,050 --> 02:05:34,010
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's see what this is.

1701
02:05:35,342 --> 02:05:35,642
[SPEAKER_05]: Action.

1702
02:05:36,043 --> 02:05:37,044
[SPEAKER_05]: DJ Ranma S in.

1703
02:05:37,164 --> 02:05:40,046
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, first off, you want to cut out the guy that says action.

1704
02:05:40,086 --> 02:05:41,227
[SPEAKER_02]: You do know that, right?

1705
02:05:41,807 --> 02:05:45,510
[SPEAKER_06]: You do realize I'm up here rushing, trying to get the video online.

1706
02:05:45,771 --> 02:05:47,312
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, all right, all right.

1707
02:05:47,372 --> 02:05:49,273
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the poster in the background, too.

1708
02:05:49,334 --> 02:05:50,394
[SPEAKER_02]: How long is your snake?

1709
02:05:52,056 --> 02:05:53,897
[SPEAKER_02]: That's also, he also has it as a shirt.

1710
02:05:54,097 --> 02:05:55,599
[SPEAKER_02]: Clever, clever.

1711
02:05:56,339 --> 02:06:00,843
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to check out OLR's exclusive game, Bunget Ferret Tossin'.

1712
02:06:03,973 --> 02:06:04,914
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you playing this in hard mode?

1713
02:06:05,034 --> 02:06:05,775
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, we're watching it.

1714
02:06:12,621 --> 02:06:14,522
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you're kind of moving around on the helicopter.

1715
02:06:14,542 --> 02:06:16,844
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't look like things are going too crazy on the ground right now.

1716
02:06:17,585 --> 02:06:18,346
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, there go the ferrets.

1717
02:06:19,867 --> 02:06:20,968
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of interesting.

1718
02:06:21,708 --> 02:06:27,554
[SPEAKER_02]: This strikes me as like a mix between like a twin stick shooter, like Geometry Wars, where you're trying to dodge all the bullets.

1719
02:06:28,454 --> 02:06:28,895
[SPEAKER_02]: But yet...

1720
02:06:30,131 --> 02:06:59,214
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a whole different element, like you don't shoot the same way It's like this mixture of Defender and Geometry Worms We can't fix the chopper in battle, so be careful Now the blood splats aren't really coming through very well on this video, but still Very cool Tell us a little more You can see the ground's all bloody, that's awesome

1721
02:06:59,881 --> 02:07:04,506
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell us a little more while we watch the rest of this gameplay video here.

1722
02:07:05,147 --> 02:07:11,614
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to say that is one of the most bloodiest 8-bit style video games I have played in a very long time.

1723
02:07:11,634 --> 02:07:12,535
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is a good thing.

1724
02:07:12,595 --> 02:07:14,097
[SPEAKER_06]: If it has our name on it, it better.

1725
02:07:17,819 --> 02:07:18,199
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

1726
02:07:18,840 --> 02:07:20,461
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what else did you see in New York Comic Con?

1727
02:07:21,361 --> 02:07:29,906
[SPEAKER_06]: Some other stuff, but before I continue, if you notice, the ferret that Fernando is tossing looks familiar if you follow Naruto.

1728
02:07:30,846 --> 02:07:31,267
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

1729
02:07:31,667 --> 02:07:32,287
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, is it?

1730
02:07:32,888 --> 02:07:34,588
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that is hers, isn't it?

1731
02:07:35,029 --> 02:07:35,729
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it is.

1732
02:07:36,229 --> 02:07:36,570
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

1733
02:07:36,710 --> 02:07:37,030
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

1734
02:07:38,331 --> 02:07:40,732
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, of course, it's a video game.

1735
02:07:40,752 --> 02:07:42,893
[SPEAKER_02]: There's got to be a Naruto reference in it someplace.

1736
02:07:43,333 --> 02:07:44,234
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's a kill counter.

1737
02:07:46,764 --> 02:07:53,991
[SPEAKER_02]: Final Fantasy XIII 2 You can jump in this game It's about freaking time I thought Square Enix didn't know how to handle jumping

1738
02:08:10,529 --> 02:08:39,433
[SPEAKER_06]: I played the demo it was pretty fun and I hate to say it I am not saying this as a 360 fanboy but they did have the 360 and the PS3 versions both sitting on display same model TVs and looks like the graphics in the 360 version looks a little bit sharper a little bit crisper interesting because usually you would think with the whole Blu-ray stuff that it would look a little better on the PlayStation 3 pretty much and I was kind of shocked by that

1739
02:08:39,960 --> 02:08:40,380
[SPEAKER_02]: Mega Man Legends

1740
02:09:08,881 --> 02:09:21,329
[SPEAKER_06]: They actually went to the Capcom booth and protested them canceling Mega Man Legends 3 They should have done an Occupy Capcom booth Occupy Capcom, is that what was going on?

1741
02:09:22,950 --> 02:09:32,596
[SPEAKER_06]: One of them actually had a sign, I might have taken a picture, Occupy Capcom Nice, we are the 99% of gamers that want a new Mega Man game Nice

1742
02:09:33,667 --> 02:09:44,773
[SPEAKER_06]: and they're all walking around the convention center trying to get people to follow with them and I saw one of them and I said, you do realize it's not going to happen, right?

1743
02:09:44,793 --> 02:09:47,415
[SPEAKER_06]: They're like, you shut up, it'll happen!

1744
02:09:47,435 --> 02:09:48,956
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm like, sure it will.

1745
02:09:51,437 --> 02:09:55,900
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be a lot harder once certain individuals have left Capcom, but okay.

1746
02:09:55,920 --> 02:09:57,641
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, pretty much.

1747
02:09:58,340 --> 02:10:00,162
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice, but they didn't get thrown out of the booth?

1748
02:10:00,783 --> 02:10:18,201
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not at all That's good, I was thinking maybe there was going to be some drama, some throwdown, some cops called No, no, no, we were too far away from that I see, I see Alright, well, I don't know what else to ask you about the con, anything else you want to share with us tonight?

1749
02:10:19,783 --> 02:10:20,704
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, let's see

1750
02:10:23,222 --> 02:10:25,704
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say the cosplays.

1751
02:10:25,764 --> 02:10:33,850
[SPEAKER_06]: The most popular gaming cosplay I saw this weekend was pretty much Link, Mario, and Peach.

1752
02:10:35,110 --> 02:10:37,532
[SPEAKER_02]: So just kind of your traditional Nintendo characters.

1753
02:10:37,572 --> 02:10:38,693
[SPEAKER_02]: Very traditional.

1754
02:10:39,332 --> 02:10:45,558
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and also there's this one guy, he cosplays the Red Trainer from Pokemon.

1755
02:10:45,838 --> 02:10:52,844
[SPEAKER_06]: He actually was walking around the convention center with his bike, playing the Pokemon theme as you're walking through, as you're playing the game.

1756
02:10:53,165 --> 02:10:54,145
[SPEAKER_06]: That background music.

1757
02:10:54,946 --> 02:10:55,286
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

1758
02:10:56,247 --> 02:10:57,308
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought that was pretty cool.

1759
02:10:57,368 --> 02:10:58,649
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds pretty intricate to me.

1760
02:11:00,551 --> 02:11:01,332
[SPEAKER_06]: He's one step up.

1761
02:11:01,512 --> 02:11:03,474
[SPEAKER_06]: I would be too lazy to do something like that.

1762
02:11:04,875 --> 02:11:05,616
[SPEAKER_02]: At least you're honest.

1763
02:11:06,854 --> 02:11:07,274
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty much.

1764
02:11:07,535 --> 02:11:08,175
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, my friend.

1765
02:11:08,195 --> 02:11:11,839
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, do you have anything else you want to share with us tonight before I let you go?

1766
02:11:11,999 --> 02:11:16,524
[SPEAKER_06]: Not now, but I think I'm waiting on a response from somebody.

1767
02:11:16,604 --> 02:11:18,245
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's some other interesting information.

1768
02:11:18,265 --> 02:11:19,867
[SPEAKER_06]: As soon as I hear it, you'll be the first to know.

1769
02:11:20,448 --> 02:11:20,868
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1770
02:11:20,968 --> 02:11:21,529
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

1771
02:11:21,669 --> 02:11:22,069
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

1772
02:11:22,129 --> 02:11:22,410
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1773
02:11:22,570 --> 02:11:23,150
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep me posted.

1774
02:11:23,631 --> 02:11:24,051
[SPEAKER_02]: Will do.

1775
02:11:24,251 --> 02:11:24,512
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1776
02:11:24,552 --> 02:11:24,912
[SPEAKER_02]: Later, buddy.

1777
02:11:25,372 --> 02:11:25,733
[SPEAKER_06]: You got it, bro.

1778
02:11:27,694 --> 02:11:31,656
[SPEAKER_02]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.

1779
02:11:31,996 --> 02:11:35,498
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm very appreciative of the video of Bungee Ferret Tossing since we weren't there to play it.

1780
02:11:36,239 --> 02:11:38,019
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm excited that it's only going to be a dollar.

1781
02:11:39,200 --> 02:11:40,741
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a bargain price for a game.

1782
02:11:41,241 --> 02:11:42,702
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that YYR is doing that.

1783
02:11:42,722 --> 02:11:46,324
[SPEAKER_02]: It really is a labor of love for the craft of creating games.

1784
02:11:46,424 --> 02:11:46,864
[SPEAKER_02]: It's awesome.

1785
02:11:47,544 --> 02:11:50,305
[SPEAKER_02]: Back to the Twitter at twitter.com slash OLR.

1786
02:11:50,365 --> 02:12:01,588
[SPEAKER_02]: Another tweet coming to us from Tigerclaw who links us to this article on Gamasutra about a mobile game that promotes social network safety for children.

1787
02:12:01,668 --> 02:12:04,989
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought we had something similar to this last week, but I don't think it's quite the same thing.

1788
02:12:05,290 --> 02:12:11,331
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I think this one is now an iOS game that's coming out and it's about Be Seen, which is like a network.

1789
02:12:11,371 --> 02:12:16,213
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess it's like telling people not to share all their personal shit online.

1790
02:12:17,711 --> 02:12:18,251
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?

1791
02:12:18,931 --> 02:12:21,532
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, because some kids don't really know better, right?

1792
02:12:22,672 --> 02:12:27,493
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've got to teach them how to handle social networking appropriately.

1793
02:12:29,534 --> 02:12:31,054
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's go to another call.

1794
02:12:31,074 --> 02:12:33,135
[SPEAKER_02]: We're getting more calls on the line here, so we'll go to another one.

1795
02:12:33,175 --> 02:12:34,055
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Challenge Radio.

1796
02:12:34,075 --> 02:12:34,415
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's this?

1797
02:12:35,155 --> 02:12:36,136
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, it's CD Thunder.

1798
02:12:36,296 --> 02:12:36,956
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, CD Thunder.

1799
02:12:36,976 --> 02:12:37,636
[SPEAKER_08]: What's on your mind, buddy?

1800
02:12:38,876 --> 02:12:39,236
[SPEAKER_08]: Not much.

1801
02:12:39,296 --> 02:12:41,017
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a couple things I'd like to talk about.

1802
02:12:41,157 --> 02:12:41,757
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, what's up?

1803
02:12:43,171 --> 02:12:48,693
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I went to the mall today and there's an arcade game that I just couldn't stop playing.

1804
02:12:48,753 --> 02:12:51,114
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, oh, man, this is so good.

1805
02:12:51,134 --> 02:12:51,995
[SPEAKER_08]: I gotta keep playing.

1806
02:12:52,075 --> 02:12:52,715
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?

1807
02:12:52,875 --> 02:12:53,355
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, of course.

1808
02:12:53,375 --> 02:12:53,855
[SPEAKER_08]: What game's that?

1809
02:12:54,876 --> 02:12:55,876
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure if you've heard of it.

1810
02:12:55,896 --> 02:12:57,597
[SPEAKER_08]: It's called Paradise Lost.

1811
02:12:59,278 --> 02:13:00,518
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think I have heard of that.

1812
02:13:00,558 --> 02:13:01,539
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell me the setup for this.

1813
02:13:03,359 --> 02:13:11,263
[SPEAKER_08]: It's basically you're this survivor on an island and you go from gun to gun and just mowing down all these guys.

1814
02:13:11,843 --> 02:13:12,063
[SPEAKER_08]: That's...

1815
02:13:12,981 --> 02:13:14,442
[SPEAKER_08]: That's how you pretty much do.

1816
02:13:14,482 --> 02:13:17,864
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you get these different bosses like helicopters and stuff.

1817
02:13:20,426 --> 02:13:21,807
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's pretty basic.

1818
02:13:22,007 --> 02:13:30,013
[SPEAKER_08]: But there's one boss that's called the Chucker, and it's this mutant-looking thing that just throws exploding barrels at you.

1819
02:13:30,535 --> 02:13:55,699
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm finding that this is apparently Paradise Lost is an arcade version of the series Far Cry and specifically Far Cry Instincts so now the way you're describing the game kind of makes a lot of sense so this is some type of like port to it I guess it's a rail shooter arcade game port of Far Cry Instincts and it was made in 2007 and I guess it uses hardware very similar to Aliens Extermination so kind of neat

1820
02:13:57,694 --> 02:14:05,096
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it would be kind of cool if they actually put Paradise Lost on the Wii or some other system because it's just a lot of fun.

1821
02:14:05,136 --> 02:14:05,896
[SPEAKER_08]: It's very addicting.

1822
02:14:06,096 --> 02:14:09,897
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, just so you know, if you do really like the game, you might want to check out the Far Cry series.

1823
02:14:09,977 --> 02:14:14,238
[SPEAKER_02]: Far Cry Instincts was on the original Xbox, not the 360, but the old, old Xbox.

1824
02:14:15,058 --> 02:14:17,079
[SPEAKER_02]: It was actually made in like 2005.

1825
02:14:17,139 --> 02:14:23,520
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you like those type of games, you know, you like that, you might enjoy the Far Cry series, which, you know, they're still making those games.

1826
02:14:23,560 --> 02:14:24,260
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Far Cry 3 is...

1827
02:14:26,661 --> 02:14:28,082
[SPEAKER_02]: Coming out next year?

1828
02:14:28,362 --> 02:14:29,323
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it's out yet.

1829
02:14:29,603 --> 02:14:31,505
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's definitely not out yet, but it's coming out soon.

1830
02:14:31,825 --> 02:14:35,828
[SPEAKER_02]: Wasn't that the one they were showing the big trailer for and it was like really like creepster looking?

1831
02:14:35,868 --> 02:14:37,409
[SPEAKER_02]: They kicked the guy down the cave.

1832
02:14:37,469 --> 02:14:38,170
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that Far Cry?

1833
02:14:38,510 --> 02:14:39,831
[SPEAKER_02]: Or am I mixing it up with another series?

1834
02:14:40,772 --> 02:14:41,292
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was.

1835
02:14:41,652 --> 02:14:42,093
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was.

1836
02:14:43,474 --> 02:14:44,214
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know offhand.

1837
02:14:44,475 --> 02:14:45,635
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, sorry, CD Thunder.

1838
02:14:45,676 --> 02:14:46,476
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't mean to digress.

1839
02:14:46,516 --> 02:14:47,497
[SPEAKER_02]: What else did you check out?

1840
02:14:48,966 --> 02:14:56,768
[SPEAKER_08]: That was the only arcade game that I want to talk about, but the next thing I'd like to discuss is what I think would make a really good game.

1841
02:14:57,148 --> 02:14:57,528
[SPEAKER_08]: Alrighty.

1842
02:14:59,268 --> 02:15:06,709
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure if you agree with me on this, but what if somebody combined House of the Dead and Carnival and made it just one game?

1843
02:15:07,870 --> 02:15:09,410
[SPEAKER_04]: That would already be House of the Dead.

1844
02:15:10,170 --> 02:15:10,830
[SPEAKER_02]: House of the Dead.

1845
02:15:11,050 --> 02:15:12,151
[SPEAKER_02]: How so, DarkSakura?

1846
02:15:12,511 --> 02:15:14,291
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's kind of like the shooter and everything?

1847
02:15:15,295 --> 02:15:23,477
[SPEAKER_02]: Or maybe I'm picturing in what CD Thunder is describing like an evil carnival, maybe, like a possessed... I guess that is carnival, isn't it?

1848
02:15:25,198 --> 02:15:28,439
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, the thing is... I think carnival just needs more zombies.

1849
02:15:30,419 --> 02:15:41,362
[SPEAKER_08]: The thing is you go to the house of the dead, and along the way you find this girl, and you rescue her, and she'd tag along with you throughout the entire...

1850
02:15:42,803 --> 02:15:54,793
[SPEAKER_08]: rest of the game and then you think you're done and then one of the evil characters from the current evil game comes out and kidnaps her and then you have to go in there and rescue her.

1851
02:15:54,933 --> 02:15:57,895
[SPEAKER_08]: So it would be one long game instead of just two separate ones.

1852
02:15:58,356 --> 02:16:02,359
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you should tweet the idea to Sega because anything is possible through Twitter.

1853
02:16:02,399 --> 02:16:04,921
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something we've learned very recently.

1854
02:16:06,702 --> 02:16:07,043
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1855
02:16:07,423 --> 02:16:10,926
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, CD Thunder buddy, I'm going to let you go so we can get more calls if you have any final thoughts.

1856
02:16:15,419 --> 02:16:16,280
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I plug something?

1857
02:16:16,941 --> 02:16:17,221
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1858
02:16:19,524 --> 02:16:21,287
[SPEAKER_08]: It's another gaming podcast.

1859
02:16:21,347 --> 02:16:23,169
[SPEAKER_08]: It's called Four Player Podcast.

1860
02:16:24,451 --> 02:16:25,232
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really good.

1861
02:16:26,493 --> 02:16:30,899
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not saying that this one isn't really good, but it's another really good one.

1862
02:16:31,934 --> 02:16:33,494
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm familiar with that show.

1863
02:16:33,514 --> 02:16:38,235
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a fine show, and I think some of their folks follow me on Twitter and vice versa.

1864
02:16:38,335 --> 02:16:46,617
[SPEAKER_02]: So they do a lot with the Justin TV integration, which is something we kind of used to do, but our radio show is not that exciting to watch.

1865
02:16:46,817 --> 02:16:54,239
[SPEAKER_02]: So getting a webcam back here hasn't exactly been a high priority for us, but they're a little better at integrating all the video, the actual gameplay and all of that.

1866
02:16:55,119 --> 02:16:57,580
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if you had a webcam, everybody could see Shermie.

1867
02:16:58,120 --> 02:16:58,600
Yeah.

1868
02:16:58,960 --> 02:17:00,600
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we just need a Shermie cam.

1869
02:17:00,620 --> 02:17:03,981
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll put a camera under the table and you can see my feet and Shermie.

1870
02:17:04,241 --> 02:17:04,962
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll think about that.

1871
02:17:05,142 --> 02:17:05,982
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good suggestion.

1872
02:17:06,382 --> 02:17:06,602
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1873
02:17:06,642 --> 02:17:07,982
[SPEAKER_02]: Later, buddy.

1874
02:17:08,182 --> 02:17:09,243
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

1875
02:17:09,263 --> 02:17:09,643
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

1876
02:17:09,663 --> 02:17:13,644
[SPEAKER_02]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio if you want to give us a call.

1877
02:17:14,524 --> 02:17:17,225
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we're out of tweets.

1878
02:17:17,365 --> 02:17:18,905
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a lot of people tweeting us this week.

1879
02:17:19,345 --> 02:17:20,105
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I will say this.

1880
02:17:20,125 --> 02:17:21,526
[SPEAKER_02]: This actually came in earlier in the week.

1881
02:17:21,986 --> 02:17:25,867
[SPEAKER_02]: Zushi13 had tweeted us saying, I got to play some Bungie Ferret Toss.

1882
02:17:25,987 --> 02:17:26,967
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a really fun game.

1883
02:17:28,510 --> 02:17:37,874
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, 13forever tweeted us saying, sweet, Scribblenauts for iOS is real and ready for install.

1884
02:17:37,994 --> 02:17:40,595
[SPEAKER_02]: And tweets us that, yeah, Scribblenauts came out on the iOS this week.

1885
02:17:40,615 --> 02:17:41,815
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember seeing that in the App Store.

1886
02:17:42,235 --> 02:17:44,876
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, my iPhone broke this week.

1887
02:17:45,016 --> 02:17:46,657
[SPEAKER_02]: My sleep button no longer works.

1888
02:17:47,457 --> 02:17:55,240
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really killed my desire to spend a lot of money on iOS products right now, especially when I can't get a new iPhone until January.

1889
02:17:55,620 --> 02:17:57,341
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was talking about this a little bit on Bobby's show.

1890
02:17:58,001 --> 02:18:02,723
[SPEAKER_02]: But, uh, you know, I'm not exactly in a rush to replace my iPhone.

1891
02:18:02,763 --> 02:18:04,844
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, now I'm thinking maybe I want a different phone.

1892
02:18:05,424 --> 02:18:07,165
[SPEAKER_02]: But yet I've spent all that money on apps.

1893
02:18:07,825 --> 02:18:08,645
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what to do.

1894
02:18:09,806 --> 02:18:10,246
[SPEAKER_02]: Wah.

1895
02:18:10,746 --> 02:18:11,686
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess we'll just take another call.

1896
02:18:11,726 --> 02:18:12,587
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.

1897
02:18:12,607 --> 02:18:12,967
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's this?

1898
02:18:13,647 --> 02:18:14,287
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Shane.

1899
02:18:14,647 --> 02:18:15,608
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, Shane, what's up?

1900
02:18:16,868 --> 02:18:18,389
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, not a whole lot.

1901
02:18:18,429 --> 02:18:23,271
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wanted to say the word Skylanders so I could hear the rant that Loki went on earlier.

1902
02:18:23,291 --> 02:18:26,552
[SPEAKER_02]: That's your fault for not being here at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.

1903
02:18:28,044 --> 02:18:30,190
[SPEAKER_09]: I had a work thing I had to go to.

1904
02:18:30,571 --> 02:18:31,293
[SPEAKER_09]: It was pizza.

1905
02:18:31,374 --> 02:18:32,697
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, I was gonna pass up pizza.

1906
02:18:35,635 --> 02:18:36,335
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Loki?

1907
02:18:37,556 --> 02:18:38,337
[SPEAKER_07]: I already made him a rant.

1908
02:18:38,797 --> 02:18:43,800
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just saying, you know, yeah, it's cool that your store sold out of them or whatever.

1909
02:18:45,441 --> 02:18:47,902
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope those four copies went pretty fast.

1910
02:18:49,163 --> 02:18:50,383
[SPEAKER_09]: I had more than four copies.

1911
02:18:50,464 --> 02:18:59,929
[SPEAKER_09]: I had like eight on PS3, eight on 360, eight on Wii, and four on 3DS, and then all the little freaking boxes of the single figurines.

1912
02:19:00,089 --> 02:19:01,050
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have games?

1913
02:19:01,110 --> 02:19:03,131
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, eight doesn't sound like a lot.

1914
02:19:03,191 --> 02:19:04,532
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, granted, you're in Kansas.

1915
02:19:04,732 --> 02:19:08,094
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm guessing it's six because they came in case slots of six.

1916
02:19:10,236 --> 02:19:11,497
[SPEAKER_07]: That's only one case of each.

1917
02:19:11,597 --> 02:19:12,297
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not a lot.

1918
02:19:13,258 --> 02:19:17,661
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm curious if there's other games that maybe have the potential to sell eight copies in a day.

1919
02:19:17,721 --> 02:19:19,001
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that doesn't sound like that many.

1920
02:19:19,762 --> 02:19:26,566
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, across multiple systems, on a Sunday release that's not a Nintendo game is pretty significant.

1921
02:19:26,606 --> 02:19:28,648
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm optimistic that they're going to fail still.

1922
02:19:29,168 --> 02:19:32,210
[SPEAKER_07]: Although I did see, I saw a review from like some site.

1923
02:19:32,610 --> 02:19:35,092
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the only review that they have right now that's like 8 out of 10.

1924
02:19:35,572 --> 02:19:41,036
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, like Kotaku, for example, they're like, I think this concept is pretty awesome.

1925
02:19:41,156 --> 02:19:45,499
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you think it's pretty awesome because they sent you five fucking copies of the game and all the toys.

1926
02:19:45,959 --> 02:19:47,160
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, this looks like fun.

1927
02:19:47,720 --> 02:19:49,742
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you kidding me whilst I open this up?

1928
02:19:51,122 --> 02:19:51,783
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, fine.

1929
02:19:52,130 --> 02:19:52,410
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever.

1930
02:19:52,930 --> 02:19:58,353
[SPEAKER_07]: But reading the feedback from people that are looking at the trailers and stuff, they're like, what the fuck happened to Spyro?

1931
02:19:58,794 --> 02:19:59,974
[SPEAKER_07]: What have they done to this guy?

1932
02:20:00,715 --> 02:20:02,195
[SPEAKER_09]: He looks pretty mean now.

1933
02:20:02,295 --> 02:20:06,538
[SPEAKER_09]: And the 3DS one comes with a black version, like an evil Spyro or something.

1934
02:20:06,778 --> 02:20:07,058
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1935
02:20:07,258 --> 02:20:10,880
[SPEAKER_09]: And that was kind of cool looking, but he still didn't look like Spyro.

1936
02:20:12,249 --> 02:20:16,290
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me kind of turn this on you and ask you about something that we also talked about in the beginning of the show.

1937
02:20:16,370 --> 02:20:20,791
[SPEAKER_02]: No, yes, because last week on the show you were here defending Final Fantasy XIV and saying I should play it again.

1938
02:20:20,931 --> 02:20:21,511
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did.

1939
02:20:22,072 --> 02:20:23,732
[SPEAKER_02]: And I talked about that at the top of the show.

1940
02:20:23,972 --> 02:20:25,672
[SPEAKER_09]: Which you said was pretty negative sounding.

1941
02:20:25,712 --> 02:20:28,313
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I would say I gave it a mixed review.

1942
02:20:28,473 --> 02:20:29,834
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there are things I like about it.

1943
02:20:29,994 --> 02:20:33,594
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the whole way you can mix and match your talents.

1944
02:20:33,955 --> 02:20:36,895
[SPEAKER_02]: And I thought there's so much more to do for a single player now.

1945
02:20:36,995 --> 02:20:39,396
[SPEAKER_02]: And I realized that a lot of the crafting jobs...

1946
02:20:39,796 --> 02:20:41,558
[SPEAKER_02]: are really there for the single player experience.

1947
02:20:41,678 --> 02:20:45,381
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not exactly going to party up to go do botany together.

1948
02:20:45,401 --> 02:20:47,103
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really part of the single player game, which is cool.

1949
02:20:47,123 --> 02:20:50,185
[SPEAKER_09]: Ooh, but we should, because that'd be hilarious.

1950
02:20:50,345 --> 02:21:00,815
[SPEAKER_02]: But my real question for you is, and then just so you know, the bottom line is, it's better, and it's much better than fucking garbage, which is what I called it last time, but I'm not going to pay the monthly fee.

1951
02:21:01,335 --> 02:21:09,875
[SPEAKER_02]: and that was the news that came out this week is that now they're charging a monthly fee for Final Fantasy XIV you didn't know that last week what's your reaction to all the news about Final Fantasy XIV this week?

1952
02:21:11,195 --> 02:21:39,785
[SPEAKER_09]: in regards to the monthly fee I feel like it's way too early and I also feel like that's not what the dev team was going for because recently in a post they said that the game's only like halfway to where they want it to be and they weren't going to start charging a fee until it was 100% that way so clearly that came from the top down I don't feel like it's really ready for a monthly fee but I will pay it because I am having fun

1953
02:21:40,805 --> 02:22:01,381
[SPEAKER_09]: and in terms of like the other things they announced like completely rebooting the game again I'm actually kind of excited for that because the one fake little screenshot they made looked really cool and they're adding classes I care about and it's more Final Fantasy now it sounds like really Final Fantasy 11 2 with all the changes they're doing

1954
02:22:01,941 --> 02:22:08,367
[SPEAKER_02]: I gotta admit, from that screenshot, I don't know why, but I was thinking it looked like Phantasy Star Online with Final Fantasy characters.

1955
02:22:08,387 --> 02:22:12,771
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be amazing, especially since we probably aren't getting Phantasy Star Online 2.

1956
02:22:13,131 --> 02:22:15,293
[SPEAKER_09]: It was one sexy-looking screenshot.

1957
02:22:15,373 --> 02:22:17,055
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a concept.

1958
02:22:17,415 --> 02:22:20,017
[SPEAKER_02]: Not until it's in my hot little hands.

1959
02:22:21,158 --> 02:22:26,163
[SPEAKER_02]: And it seems weird to me that they're going to make the graphics look better, yet allow the game to run on lower-end PCs.

1960
02:22:26,183 --> 02:22:26,263
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1961
02:22:26,443 --> 02:22:28,904
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just about optimization, though, from what I understand.

1962
02:22:29,204 --> 02:22:31,685
[SPEAKER_09]: This game is horribly optimized for anything.

1963
02:22:31,865 --> 02:22:37,767
[SPEAKER_07]: Once again, though, we're talking a year's time that this thing is going to be fully rebooted.

1964
02:22:39,768 --> 02:22:44,769
[SPEAKER_07]: I just can only imagine the games are going to look still even better than they are now.

1965
02:22:46,090 --> 02:22:49,891
[SPEAKER_07]: To me, it's almost like the Wii U, I guess.

1966
02:22:50,211 --> 02:22:52,352
[SPEAKER_07]: How they're kind of late to the game with everything.

1967
02:22:52,412 --> 02:22:54,493
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, oh, look, we're pushing these HD graphics.

1968
02:22:54,853 --> 02:22:57,393
[SPEAKER_07]: that everyone else has been putting out for years now.

1969
02:22:59,394 --> 02:23:00,294
[SPEAKER_07]: It kind of seems like to me.

1970
02:23:00,794 --> 02:23:01,574
[SPEAKER_07]: But it still looks sexy.

1971
02:23:02,834 --> 02:23:03,995
[SPEAKER_07]: Will it be good enough for me to play?

1972
02:23:04,035 --> 02:23:08,696
[SPEAKER_02]: It does have the uniqueness of being a Japanese MMO that's pretty big here in the States.

1973
02:23:09,796 --> 02:23:11,076
[SPEAKER_02]: At least Final Fantasy XI is.

1974
02:23:11,436 --> 02:23:17,777
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's not a lot of Asian, in general, no matter what country, MMOs that do very well here.

1975
02:23:17,877 --> 02:23:21,778
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the MMOs that are doing well here are developed by studios that are here.

1976
02:23:22,398 --> 02:23:24,761
[SPEAKER_02]: Like WoW, of course, is the big one, developed by Blizzard.

1977
02:23:25,122 --> 02:23:26,283
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I don't know.

1978
02:23:29,107 --> 02:23:32,912
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that was really all I wanted to ask you, was about Final Fantasy XIV and where you're at with that.

1979
02:23:33,233 --> 02:23:38,600
[SPEAKER_02]: So are you going to be paying for WoW and Final Fantasy XIV, or are you saying you're into XIV so much you might cancel WoW?

1980
02:23:39,720 --> 02:23:40,942
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, yeah, I might.

1981
02:23:41,022 --> 02:23:46,730
[SPEAKER_09]: It depends on what BlizzCon says this week and how fun 4.3 is.

1982
02:23:47,070 --> 02:23:55,482
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, when it comes out, because who knows how long that is, but I'm just sick of, you know, grinding Rep in Firelands and jumping.

1983
02:23:56,320 --> 02:23:59,122
[SPEAKER_02]: So Final Fantasy XIV is something pretty and distracting right now, right?

1984
02:23:59,722 --> 02:24:09,688
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, and it's still free because they said they'll give us ample notice of when it actually goes to pay and I'm guessing it's more like early December instead of late November.

1985
02:24:09,829 --> 02:24:11,730
[SPEAKER_02]: So I still have like two months.

1986
02:24:12,210 --> 02:24:15,172
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm wondering how my 30-day trial is going to play into it.

1987
02:24:15,232 --> 02:24:17,093
[SPEAKER_02]: I totally am going to get screwed with that.

1988
02:24:17,133 --> 02:24:20,035
[SPEAKER_02]: Like my 30-day trial will be up and then the fee kicks in.

1989
02:24:20,075 --> 02:24:21,476
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like I didn't get shit.

1990
02:24:22,116 --> 02:24:24,258
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't get shit like everybody else got.

1991
02:24:24,378 --> 02:24:24,658
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh well.

1992
02:24:25,234 --> 02:24:26,255
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, well, I'm part of that, too.

1993
02:24:26,295 --> 02:24:28,696
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I've only been playing for, what, a week longer than you?

1994
02:24:28,776 --> 02:24:30,276
[SPEAKER_09]: You didn't even buy the damn game.

1995
02:24:30,316 --> 02:24:32,057
[SPEAKER_09]: It was comped to you, so shut up.

1996
02:24:32,637 --> 02:24:33,698
[SPEAKER_02]: I did get it for free.

1997
02:24:33,718 --> 02:24:36,879
[SPEAKER_02]: But I still won a free 30-day trial, too.

1998
02:24:37,880 --> 02:24:41,542
[SPEAKER_02]: I paid half what most people paid for it new, but I still paid 25 bucks for it.

1999
02:24:41,962 --> 02:24:43,803
[SPEAKER_02]: And then my DVD was damaged.

2000
02:24:44,483 --> 02:24:45,283
[SPEAKER_02]: And screw that.

2001
02:24:46,244 --> 02:24:49,505
[SPEAKER_02]: Square needs to learn how to make a PC game, for fuck's sake.

2002
02:24:50,446 --> 02:24:52,447
[SPEAKER_02]: I do think the game is going to be pretty neat on PlayStation 3.

2003
02:24:53,707 --> 02:24:56,949
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think I might jump to that when it comes out.

2004
02:24:57,049 --> 02:24:58,971
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think the game can save itself?

2005
02:24:59,351 --> 02:25:03,954
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think a game can actually relaunch and be credible?

2006
02:25:04,854 --> 02:25:10,598
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it can, but probably not to the extent that they're hoping for.

2007
02:25:11,178 --> 02:25:13,460
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it'll bring in a few more people.

2008
02:25:14,020 --> 02:25:19,864
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll probably keep the current players, but it's not going to be a huge relaunch.

2009
02:25:20,444 --> 02:25:24,677
[SPEAKER_09]: Despite what they want You're not going to get thousands and thousands of more people playing

2010
02:25:25,026 --> 02:25:42,174
[SPEAKER_02]: I think honestly the smart thing for them to do is to go to the Guild Wars model where you're not totally free to play but once you buy the game you get to play online for free and they should look at doing expansions for money or just more regular content updates like what they're doing with Final Fantasy XI that cost money and that's how they should do it.

2011
02:25:42,234 --> 02:25:43,594
[SPEAKER_02]: If they did that I'd buy it.

2012
02:25:43,734 --> 02:25:46,055
[SPEAKER_02]: The monthly fee is not going to work for this game anymore.

2013
02:25:46,075 --> 02:25:51,638
[SPEAKER_09]: Except for Final Fantasy XI does those little baby expansions and still charges you a monthly fee.

2014
02:25:51,798 --> 02:25:53,779
[SPEAKER_02]: But Final Fantasy XI is also a better game.

2015
02:25:54,680 --> 02:25:55,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, that's true.

2016
02:25:56,861 --> 02:25:57,142
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2017
02:25:57,202 --> 02:25:57,902
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not as pretty.

2018
02:25:58,923 --> 02:25:59,163
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2019
02:25:59,223 --> 02:26:00,585
[SPEAKER_02]: On that note, I'm going to let you go, all right?

2020
02:26:01,105 --> 02:26:01,365
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2021
02:26:01,505 --> 02:26:01,706
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2022
02:26:01,726 --> 02:26:01,986
[SPEAKER_02]: Take care.

2023
02:26:02,006 --> 02:26:02,506
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

2024
02:26:02,546 --> 02:26:02,867
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

2025
02:26:04,288 --> 02:26:04,588
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2026
02:26:04,608 --> 02:26:06,250
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

2027
02:26:06,570 --> 02:26:10,033
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry to those of you that didn't get through, but why don't you think about writing us an email?

2028
02:26:10,433 --> 02:26:14,697
[SPEAKER_02]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send us an email if you'd like.

2029
02:26:15,357 --> 02:26:17,139
[SPEAKER_02]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com or, of course, Twitter.

2030
02:26:17,239 --> 02:26:18,600
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a very empty Twitter tonight.

2031
02:26:18,620 --> 02:26:19,341
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm very sad.

2032
02:26:19,421 --> 02:26:21,323
[SPEAKER_02]: Twitter.com slash OLR.

2033
02:26:22,023 --> 02:26:24,164
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well that's going to wrap up another show.

2034
02:26:24,344 --> 02:26:28,066
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got to ask though, DarkSakura and Loki, if they have any last minute stories they want to throw out here?

2035
02:26:28,807 --> 02:26:30,728
[SPEAKER_04]: I've started a political social blog.

2036
02:26:31,128 --> 02:26:31,508
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh dear.

2037
02:26:32,889 --> 02:26:34,490
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait a minute, women think independently now?

2038
02:26:35,703 --> 02:26:36,604
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm teasing.

2039
02:26:39,905 --> 02:26:40,346
[SPEAKER_02]: Girl.

2040
02:26:42,227 --> 02:26:43,567
[SPEAKER_02]: She's trying very hard not to laugh.

2041
02:26:43,607 --> 02:26:46,369
[SPEAKER_02]: Like she wants to give me that stern I hate you look, but she can't do it.

2042
02:26:46,389 --> 02:26:48,670
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob's going to take me to Pinkberry to appease me.

2043
02:26:48,830 --> 02:26:49,510
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, whatever.

2044
02:26:50,011 --> 02:26:50,331
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2045
02:26:50,891 --> 02:26:51,071
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

2046
02:26:51,832 --> 02:26:52,752
[SPEAKER_02]: Vote no on that.

2047
02:26:53,192 --> 02:26:54,533
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my political blog.

2048
02:26:55,974 --> 02:26:56,274
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2049
02:26:56,294 --> 02:26:57,335
[SPEAKER_02]: You know I'm just giving you a hard time.

2050
02:26:57,355 --> 02:26:57,795
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know.

2051
02:26:58,035 --> 02:26:58,675
[SPEAKER_02]: Good luck with that.

2052
02:26:58,715 --> 02:27:02,858
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what you're... I was going to do another joke, but I can't.

2053
02:27:03,018 --> 02:27:03,958
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's my second blog.

2054
02:27:04,379 --> 02:27:04,679
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2055
02:27:05,579 --> 02:27:07,320
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause my other blog's like about girly shit.

2056
02:27:08,021 --> 02:27:08,721
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, alright.

2057
02:27:09,822 --> 02:27:13,084
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, uh, Loki, any last minute news you want to get into?

2058
02:27:13,104 --> 02:27:18,207
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, they're supposed to be doing a Layton Brothers game for iPhone sometime soon.

2059
02:27:18,367 --> 02:27:20,508
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm assuming this is only going to be on the Japanese iOS, so.

2060
02:27:22,418 --> 02:27:22,878
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

2061
02:27:42,965 --> 02:27:47,590
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to read this because this guy said after five years listening, he's finally listening to a live show.

2062
02:27:47,630 --> 02:27:49,813
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Swongtong is the name in chat.

2063
02:27:49,913 --> 02:27:55,258
[SPEAKER_02]: And Swongtong asks, how come MMOs on PlayStation 3 don't use the mouse and keyboard?

2064
02:27:55,859 --> 02:27:57,401
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, some do.

2065
02:27:57,481 --> 02:28:02,987
[SPEAKER_02]: And I believe Final Fantasy 14 is still they're going to plan on using a keyboard even when it rolls out to the PlayStation 3.

2066
02:28:03,507 --> 02:28:08,348
[SPEAKER_02]: And everything on PlayStation 3 is all Bluetooth and USB anyway, right?

2067
02:28:08,788 --> 02:28:11,149
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I know on Xbox 360, you can hook in a keyboard.

2068
02:28:11,189 --> 02:28:13,689
[SPEAKER_02]: You can play Final Fantasy XI on 360 with a keyboard.

2069
02:28:13,769 --> 02:28:15,950
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to do that when it first came out.

2070
02:28:16,450 --> 02:28:19,931
[SPEAKER_02]: So as far as PlayStation 3 goes, you can put in a keyboard.

2071
02:28:20,371 --> 02:28:22,691
[SPEAKER_02]: You can type messages and so forth.

2072
02:28:23,032 --> 02:28:24,632
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as MMOs embracing it...

2073
02:28:24,972 --> 02:28:28,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, maybe the keyboard adoption policy isn't maybe high enough to do that.

2074
02:28:28,134 --> 02:28:33,739
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think for a game like Final Fantasy XIV, like if I were to play that on the PlayStation 3, I definitely would have to have a keyboard.

2075
02:28:34,439 --> 02:28:37,762
[SPEAKER_02]: Luckily, I already have one that's specifically for the gaming consoles.

2076
02:28:38,062 --> 02:28:38,722
[SPEAKER_02]: It lights up blue.

2077
02:28:38,762 --> 02:28:39,363
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really pretty.

2078
02:28:40,444 --> 02:28:40,684
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2079
02:28:41,404 --> 02:28:43,506
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, any other stories for us tonight?

2080
02:28:46,255 --> 02:29:04,849
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, no, the only other story I have is not really gaming related, but my wife is trying to download the version of Firefox that is British English so that all of her stuff will be spellchecked into the Queen's English because she's obsessed with Game of Thrones and I don't know why.

2081
02:29:06,850 --> 02:29:26,330
[SPEAKER_02]: so she better start learning to use more vowels I would have put that on DarkSakura to do something like that before Nelly I've done it before okay never mind I stand no I've actually got I've actually got a British grammar checker okay because well every so okay here's a true story use less Z's and more U's there you go

2082
02:29:26,670 --> 02:29:30,933
[SPEAKER_04]: In college, I actually had this whole thing where I was doing nothing but writing everything in British English.
