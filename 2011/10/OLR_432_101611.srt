Tonight, October 16th, 2011

00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Street Fighter X Tekken gets a release date

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
has Sony Playstation Network information been compromised again

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and a date is set for the new Xbox Dashboard

00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Orange Lounge Radio

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and welcome back to another week of the show

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
where every gamer has a voice

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Orange Lounge Radio

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
It is episode number 432

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
for this October 16th, 2011

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
My name is Rob Roberts

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
and I'll be joining you over the next few hours

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
with my awesome co-hosts

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
First off, the one and the only DarkSakura

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Jamie Summers

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Hi

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
How are you Miss Summers?

23
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Caffeinated

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Mildly caffeinated

25
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
as opposed to extremely caffeinated

26
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Yeah, because I had to decaf coffee

27
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
but there's some caffeine in it

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Yes, a little bit

29
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It's decaffeinated but not uncaffeinated

30
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Enough to bounce the headache

31
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Say hello as well to tech master Loki

32
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Hello

33
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Who I notice has brought dinner of choice tonight

34
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
an entire pizza

35
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Is this triple bacon? Quadruple bacon?

36
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Triple bacon with Red Bull

37
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
What a very nerd powered dinner

38
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I love it

39
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Alright, we do tape live every Sunday night

40
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern

41
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at All Games Radio

42
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
www.allgames.com

43
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Join us in our chat room if you are listening live

44
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
chat.orangelaunchradio.com

45
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
After all, we are the show where every gamer has a voice

46
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
By the way, speaking of Bobby

47
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
who comes on, of course, before us live every week

48
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
he had a great interview tonight

49
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
and if you don't listen to his show

50
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
you really should check it out

51
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
go look at it on iTunes or whatever

52
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
because he had an interview with some of the famous voices at Valve

53
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
including Dark Soccer, one of your favorites

54
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
GLaDOS was on the show tonight

55
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
so it was a fun listen

56
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
so I guess he ran into them at an Atlanta based convention

57
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Does that mean he's going to have new bumpers?

58
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I would think so

59
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I would hope so man

60
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
He's not going to have new bumpers because of that

61
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I hope he did get something out of that

62
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
He better

63
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Can you record a bumper for my show?

64
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
What I liked

65
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I will be 100% honest

66
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I didn't hear the entire interview

67
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
because we used Bobby's time to get some set up

68
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
and some stuff of our own done

69
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
but I heard about half of it

70
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
and one of the questions that I liked was that

71
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
he asked them if they'd heard the

72
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
commercial for the iPhone 4s

73
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
that had GLaDOS' voice over it

74
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
we played it on the show last week

75
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
and he had heard

76
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
because they're a husband and wife

77
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
and the husband had heard it, but she hadn't

78
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
but he was trying to explain it to her

79
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
and it was kind of funny

80
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
He had that voice modulation program

81
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
because that was dead on

82
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'm sure it's doable in Adobe Audition

83
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
not too difficult

84
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
He'd probably just Google GLaDOS Adobe Audition

85
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I don't know, probably a way to do it

86
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Bobby, by the way, is in our chat

87
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
He says two new bumpers

88
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Not one, but two

89
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Alright

90
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Let's see what else is going on

91
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
in our worlds today

92
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I want to mention this

93
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Usually we have a little chatter here at the top of the show

94
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
before we get into our gaming weeks

95
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
and I was specifically asked

96
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
to mention this to you, Loki, tonight

97
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I've been waiting to tell you about this

98
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Miklotov gave me a call about

99
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
two hours before we went live tonight

100
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
and he works in gaming retail

101
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
and he sells video games

102
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
He wanted me to tell you about

103
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
a game that came out today

104
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Skylander Spyro Adventure

105
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I saw the ads for that on YouTube

106
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Apparently

107
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
if you've been listening to the show for a few weeks

108
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I know Loki is a huge fan

109
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I love it

110
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Alright, quickly reiterate for us

111
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
What is this game and why do you hate it?

112
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
This game is basically

113
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
everything that's wrong about Activision

114
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
all lumped up into one game

115
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
It's basically Activision taking

116
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Spyro, a franchise that was beloved

117
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
years ago

118
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
turning it on its edge and basically

119
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
making it this thing where

120
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
instead of having download content for the game

121
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
you're going to have actual physical

122
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
add-ons that you buy

123
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
as in the little

124
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I wouldn't even call them toys or figurines

125
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
that interact with this thing they call a portal

126
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
so you basically stick these little figurines

127
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
on this little portal device and you get to play

128
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I'm playing this trailer here that I'm not exactly sure what I'm going to see here because I know very little about this game but I guess this is something like

129
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I would buy that for a child

130
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
That's more like a morning star

131
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
It's a character

132
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It's basically a character

133
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You get these characters

134
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
that you can play as

135
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It comes with three including Spyro

136
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Spyro by the way looks like he's

137
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
extremely angsty and emo now

138
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
He's just ridiculous

139
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Doesn't look anything like the old Spyro

140
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
It's just basically a platform hack and slash game

141
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
but the game requires you

142
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
to switch between these different types

143
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
of characters based on different elemental

144
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
powers that they have

145
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
so like fire characters can't go underwater

146
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
and vice versa

147
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
so you have to keep switching characters

148
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
in order to finish parts of the game

149
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
but there's thirty fucking characters that you can buy

150
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
for this and might I add

151
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
they're all eight dollars

152
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
can you imagine if DLC out there

153
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
for your favorite game and hell

154
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
even Marvel vs. Capcom 3

155
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
which had really expensive DLC

156
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
it was like five bucks a character

157
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I think

158
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
eight dollars for each individual character

159
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
or you can get like a three pack I think

160
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
maybe twenty bucks or something like that

161
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
it's just, it's ridiculous

162
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
but they're aiming this at

163
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
kids because they did really well with

164
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
their stupid toy titles like

165
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Zuzu Pets and

166
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Squinkies and they have a whole

167
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
bunch of them coming out this November

168
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
but I hate it because one

169
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
it's difficult

170
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
to sell

171
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
kind of on the back side you don't really see any of this

172
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
but the way they had us set

173
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
up the items and

174
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
buy it and stuff is retarded

175
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
and um

176
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
honestly this looks like another Tony Hawk

177
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
ride or you know

178
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
something like that

179
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
it's just, it's a peripheral game

180
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
that's just not going to work and on top of that

181
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
you know because they're really trying to attract everybody

182
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
it's eighty dollars to buy

183
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
it on any platform

184
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
including 3DS, eighty dollars

185
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
well Mieglatov

186
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
wanted me to tell you it's selling

187
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
like crazy

188
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
apparently they are already sold out

189
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
of all, like it just came out today I think

190
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
they're already sold out of it on like every

191
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
platform but the Wii, most of the

192
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
characters are already gone, it's selling

193
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
like crazy apparently

194
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
well fantastic

195
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
and I know that was my reaction

196
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
too I was like great, that means

197
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
it's going to end up maybe, maybe

198
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
still too early to tell being the must have toy

199
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
this Christmas, oh well they've already, they're already

200
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
in bed with Toys R Us and they

201
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
worked a deal with them where they get an

202
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
exclusive three character pack for

203
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
you know that title being placed on their

204
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
hot fifteen toy

205
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
titles of the holiday, so yeah

206
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
that list is trusting

207
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
whatever, you know what

208
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
cool, if it does well for them

209
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
awesome, but I just

210
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I've asked first off

211
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
how many did they bring in because

212
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
you know, selling out, trust me

213
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
with the quantities that my

214
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
customers are buying, selling out

215
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
wouldn't be that many titles

216
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
alright, I've got to go to our chatroom

217
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
at chat.orangelaunchy.com, after all we are the

218
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
show where every gamer has a voice and not every gamer

219
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
necessarily agrees, going to our chat

220
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
rooms, ShadowNextGen says

221
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Skylander Spyro Adventure is the first good

222
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Spyro game in a while, I'm reviewing it right

223
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
now and it's a lot of fun

224
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
you can beat the new Spyro game

225
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
with the three included characters

226
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
you are not required to buy anything else

227
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
and he also says

228
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Spyro is seventy dollars not eighty dollars

229
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
sixty nine ninety nine

230
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
you're wrong Loki, you're very

231
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
wrong, oh I'm sorry

232
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
alright

233
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
and DarkTetsuya says I'd be willing

234
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
to bet that it sells a million copies

235
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
invoking an old

236
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
OLR joke from yesteryear

237
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
so there you go

238
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I don't know, like that little clip

239
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I looked at didn't look terrible but

240
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I can see where

241
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
especially on the back end point

242
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
it's probably really annoying where you have

243
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
like all these different peripherals

244
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
that are going out there for this game

245
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I'm sure this is very uninteresting but let me tell you

246
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
how they have it so that you have to order this

247
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
yes please start off our show tonight with something completely

248
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
uninteresting, ok well anyways

249
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
so they sell these twelve characters

250
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
this is their first wave of characters that they have

251
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
out right now, ok so twelve

252
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
different SKUs that you have

253
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
but then there's this generic

254
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
SKU that represents the full case

255
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
but you have to order that generic

256
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
SKU by how many characters you want

257
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
so it comes twelve to

258
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
a case, so you have to order twelve

259
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
so it makes it look like, in our system

260
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
that you're receiving twelve cases

261
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
instead of one case with twelve characters

262
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
in it, because it's fucking back asswords

263
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
so

264
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I just, I hate that

265
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
so it sounds like a lot of your frustration with this game

266
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
really has nothing to do with the game itself

267
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
it looks terrible, ok, they showed it to me

268
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
they showed it to me, I actually got to

269
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
play a little bit of the Wii version

270
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
and I was just unimpressed, I was just like

271
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
big fucking whoop, oh good

272
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
why do I need this stupid portal thing

273
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
why couldn't this have easily been done

274
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
in game without any of these extra characters

275
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
oh I know why, because Activision

276
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
wants to get in the toy business, because they think

277
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
hey, if we can convince stupid parents to

278
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
buy these eight dollar pieces of crap

279
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
for their kids

280
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
then we're in the money

281
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
to be fair, it's a good idea

282
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I mean isn't that every Christmas

283
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
trying to convince parents to buy an eight dollar piece of

284
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
crap for their kids? Yeah, pretty much

285
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
but I'm just saying

286
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
you're a parent now, would you consider

287
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
buying it? No, I would not

288
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
you already knew what I was gonna ask

289
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I would not, and you know why? Because it's not a fucking toy

290
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
a toy does something

291
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
a toy would be something that you could play with

292
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
outside of the game, like

293
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
ok, if they were action figures or something

294
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
like that, like a GI Joe

295
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
or Ninja Turtles or whatever, they actually moved

296
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
did something, then that's fine

297
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
then that's cool if they, you know, worked with the game

298
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
and you could play with them outside of it

299
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I could see that worth eight dollars, but they don't do anything

300
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
will Josh only be allowed to play with toys

301
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
from the 80's? No, he will not

302
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
be allowed to just play with toys from the 80's

303
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
but I'm just, I'm not gonna buy him something

304
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
that doesn't, like

305
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
a statue that has no articulation

306
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
ok, maybe a little bit of

307
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
articulation with these, I don't really know if

308
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
maybe their arms move a little bit, but

309
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
they're stuck to a base

310
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
and

311
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
yeah, I know, you know, back in the days

312
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
you know, there was the green plastic

313
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
army men, and those were also stuck to a base

314
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
but you know what, they weren't fucking seventy dollars

315
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
either

316
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
or eight dollars

317
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
alright, is he allowed to have, uh, Tron

318
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
toys? Cause maybe I'll, uh

319
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
well he's probably too young right now, but maybe in a couple years

320
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
right now he just likes books

321
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
he likes books, he likes books

322
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
uh, we, uh, brought down

323
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
out of the attic, uh, Teddy Ruxpin

324
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
and uh, Grubby

325
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
and um, I actually, we popped

326
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
in a tape last night, man, it still

327
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
works? It still works! Wow!

328
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Oh, it's, it's in great condition

329
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I kept that in great condition, and we also have

330
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Grubby, and I just had to find a

331
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
cable to run to, uh

332
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
it just needs an audio cable so that they both

333
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
talk, but he thought it was cool for a few

334
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
minutes, and then he went and

335
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I don't know, was trying to steal

336
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
the iPod. Well, a kid his age

337
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
is supposed to have a short detention span, that's what happens

338
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
but yeah, I still, you know what

339
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
despite the fact that they sold well

340
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
in Miklotov's store, I still hope

341
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
it fails. Why?

342
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Because I, I hate Activision and their

343
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
experiments to try to capitalize on

344
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I mean, seriously, they're trying to run

345
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
this franchise into the ground, they've already tried

346
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
with a few games already, and

347
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
now it's just like, whoring this thing out

348
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
it's Spyro and friends, I mean

349
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
take Spyro out of it

350
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I mean, seriously, just take him

351
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
out of it, I mean, he's not a draw anymore to these

352
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
games. I, I do want to move on past the subject

353
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
but I gotta say this one other comment from Shadow

354
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Next Gen in our chatroom at chat.com

355
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
because I gotta say this does sound pretty cool

356
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Shadow Next Gen says, Skylanders

357
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Spyro's adventure is also cross-console

358
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
kids who have a 360 can bring the character

359
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
to their friend's house and play on the Wii version

360
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
with all the progress that they had on the 360

361
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
version, and I gotta admit, that sounds kinda cool

362
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Loki's giving me a

363
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
blank stare, he doesn't care

364
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I don't care, I really

365
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
don't. Alright,

366
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
fine, alright, and Tigerclaw

367
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
suggests, put a tape of OLR recorded

368
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
on it and watch Teddy Ruxpin talk

369
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
like everyone. I don't know if

370
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
daddy would necessarily want

371
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Josh hearing him, some of the rants

372
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
he does on this program. And also

373
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I don't fucking have a tape recorder anymore

374
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
so how would I do that?

375
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I mean, seriously, I'd have to go to my

376
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
sister's house and she has

377
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
my old, like, stereo system

378
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I think it has a tape player, I'm not sure if it works

379
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
anymore because that's usually the first thing to break

380
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I actually, I had a huge old

381
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
boombox when I moved this last time

382
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
that had tape recorders in it and everything

383
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I fucking threw it away

384
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
like, I didn't even try to sell it on

385
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Craig's system, I can't. She uses it for like

386
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
a little, you know, cheap ass surround sound

387
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
system or whatever, but you know, those

388
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
the tape recorders are always the first things that break

389
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
on those, it's like the door falls off

390
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
or, you know, just something doesn't work

391
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
it eats tapes, you know

392
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I saw a great

393
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
picture on Facebook

394
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
earlier in the week, or maybe it was last week

395
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
it had a little picture of a cassette tape

396
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
pencil and it said, if you don't know what

397
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
these two items have in common

398
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
then you're too young

399
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
thought it was funny

400
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
it was an old people joke, alright

401
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
moving on

402
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
not so light-hearted news, in fact this is

403
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
kind of sad, and it sucks that I'm having

404
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
to do a eulogy two weeks in a row

405
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
but that's just unfortunately the tech world

406
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
has lost a lot of great people in the past couple weeks

407
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
and this week we lost Dennis Ritchie

408
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
and you may not recognize

409
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
the name as readily as you might

410
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
say Steve Jobs, who we were talking about last week

411
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
but Dennis Ritchie

412
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
obviously had a direct impact

413
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
on pretty much everything

414
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
in the video game world. Why?

415
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Well, if you didn't know, he only

416
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
like wrote the C programming

417
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
language

418
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
that's kind of important because like

419
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
every programming language out there is

420
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
just about, anyway, like some type of

421
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
derivative

422
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
derivative, thank you

423
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I don't know why the words gave me, of C

424
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
so I even learned

425
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
a little bit of C++ when I was in college

426
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I actually originally studied to be a computer programmer

427
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
but

428
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
it wasn't really free

429
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
it worked out terribly and I actually

430
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
this is the ironic thing, I actually blame my teacher

431
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I had a horrible, horrible

432
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
professor and I don't think

433
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I went to a very good university either

434
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
you know

435
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
and granted there was some things going on in my personal life

436
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I can't scapegoat everything, a lot of it is

437
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
my fault too, but let's

438
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
be real, computer science was just not for me

439
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
ironically what do I end up doing now for a living

440
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
not this show, that's not my day job

441
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
trust me, but the job I had that pays

442
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
the bills, I'm a teacher

443
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
in a corporate environment so I teach

444
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
adults much like the professor did so it's

445
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
just kind of ironic that that's where I ended up

446
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
but anyway

447
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I don't want to get too far away from the topic at hand

448
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
obviously we have to tip the hat to Dennis Ritchie

449
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
who created C programming language

450
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
also was a

451
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
co-creator of the Unix operating

452
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
system, which is a huge deal

453
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
he passed away this week at 70

454
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
years old, CAUSE is

455
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
undisclosed at this time

456
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
so

457
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I think we're ready to move on to our gaming week

458
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I think CAUSE was sadness from hearing that Skylanders

459
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
is coming out, stop it, stop it right

460
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
now, it's terrible, don't joke, alright

461
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
moving on, Dark Sakura

462
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
how was your gaming week?

463
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I played stuff other than WoW

464
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
oh my god, congratulations

465
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
everybody give Dark Sakura a round of applause

466
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
yay, woo

467
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
well when you came in I was playing Castlevania Symphony of the Night

468
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
because we finally got it working on the system

469
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
you sure were

470
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
and of course I was screaming because

471
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
dammit it's not, you know, playing it on the Playstation

472
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
and I walked in the house and I said

473
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
what is a man? and I threw a glass on the ground

474
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
and Dan got very angry

475
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
especially since it was our glass

476
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
and I called him a miserable

477
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
little pile of secrets

478
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
he just said, bitch, clean that up

479
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
pretty much, yeah

480
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
we also played

481
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Guardian Heroes today, we got the demo

482
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
and then Dan proceeded to go

483
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
wait I want to play Radiant Silvergun

484
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
and decided to play Radiant Silvergun and the demo was like

485
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
half a level, it's not even

486
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
worth

487
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
doing, at least, you know, the first

488
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
stage is what you can play in Guardian Heroes

489
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
so

490
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
we kind of got our Saturn

491
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
on, I guess, on the Xbox

492
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
and then he played through a whole bunch of After Burner Climax

493
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
and that was it

494
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
good times, so it sounds like you had an Xbox Live arcade party

495
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
kind of, yeah

496
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
kind of, yeah, alright, moving on, Loki

497
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
how was your gaming week?

498
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
um, playing more Grand Theft Auto

499
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
and um

500
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I'm playing Earth Defense Force

501
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
this week, more Dead Rising 2

502
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
off the record though, are you feeling okay?

503
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
no, I just didn't get

504
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
around to playing more

505
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Earth Defense Force because I was

506
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
playing Dead Rising off the record

507
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
and it's alright, it's

508
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
you know, I know a lot of the

509
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
complaints that other people have because I didn't really

510
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
play through Dead Rising 2

511
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
playing through sandbox mode, it's kind of relaxing

512
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
actually, although I still don't

513
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
understand why zombies are easily

514
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
killed by guns

515
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
but people are not

516
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
for some reason, there is like

517
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
it was great because there was a part in the sandbox

518
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
mode where this bride's like, help, help

519
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
so you go up to her and then she starts shooting with

520
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
a gun, so I pull out

521
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
a shotgun, you know, because what wins in a gunfight?

522
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
a bigger gun

523
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
so the shotgun

524
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
to a zombie will literally cut it in half

525
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
it will just sever the body

526
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
in half and make it explode

527
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
whereas this woman, who is

528
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
a bride, can take like eight

529
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
rounds of a shotgun to the face

530
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
that doesn't make

531
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
any sense to me, out of all

532
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
the game, I mean, completely unrealistic whatsoever

533
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I just don't get it, why are the crazies

534
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
you know, more armored than

535
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
zombies? I think, granted, the zombies

536
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
are dead already, but

537
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I mean, shit, it should only take a couple

538
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
of shotgun rounds, and I understand you want to make it

539
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
difficult because they're like boss characters

540
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
or whatever, but

541
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I don't know, just put more of them on

542
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
the screen or something

543
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
but it's a fun game

544
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
my character is currently dressed up like a cowboy now

545
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
because I'm still

546
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
going through every single piece of clothing I find

547
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I pick it up

548
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
is this the game that has the protoman costume I was

549
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
reading about this week too?

550
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
even though Capcom hates

551
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Mega Man

552
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
that's why it's protoman, not Mega Man

553
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
oh, touche

554
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
alright, well if that's it for your gaming week

555
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
my gaming week was a lot of

556
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
games you would not be expecting me to play

557
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I played a demo

558
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I hate basing

559
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
my assumptions of games off the demo

560
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
but let's be real, it's what a lot of us are doing

561
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
in this day and age of digital download

562
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
and I downloaded the demo for a game

563
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I was interested in at first because I love

564
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
this series, Burnout Crash

565
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
is the game I downloaded

566
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
and I like Burnout an awful lot, the whole series

567
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
is really fun

568
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
and the crash mode in

569
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Burnout Takedown 3

570
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
that was fun, it's awesome

571
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
and when I heard they were making a whole game

572
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
based on that mode, I was really excited

573
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
and so I downloaded the demo, I played it

574
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
and it was the most uninteresting game

575
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I think I've played in a very long time

576
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I'm sorry to say

577
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
but the whole switch to 2D

578
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
was just really boring

579
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
and how can a game

580
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
about explosions and crashes

581
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
and everything be boring

582
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
but it's like, I don't know, suddenly I feel like it's

583
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
this really slow moving

584
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
puzzle based game

585
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
and for those that haven't

586
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
played Burnout or know what the crash mode

587
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
is, basically it's all about creating

588
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
these huge explosions

589
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
and you can press a button to blow

590
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
up your car, essentially

591
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
and as you fill up a meter, you can blow up your car

592
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
again and again, you're causing these big

593
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
chain reactions and pile ups, and I know that sounds

594
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
really exciting, but in a 2D

595
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Xbox Live Arcade title, it was just

596
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
it was really boring

597
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I was so not interested in the game

598
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
after just, and I tried

599
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I played through the whole first little demo and everything

600
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I just, I don't want to drop

601
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
$15 on this, sorry, so

602
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
sorry Burnout, just not a fan

603
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
of the crash arcade, sorry

604
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I would love to play a game

605
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
that was like actual racing

606
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
crash mode though, because that was a lot of fun

607
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
in Burnout 3, and I can see where maybe

608
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
somebody thought on paper it was a good idea, but it's

609
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
not, sorry

610
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I also played

611
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
NBA Jam on Fire edition

612
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
which, you know what

613
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I miss about the original NBA

614
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Jam, the fact that it only had three buttons

615
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
and I don't know, like I tried to play

616
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
this new NBA Jam and I was just like

617
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
my characters were not doing anything I wanted them to

618
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
do, and you know, granted

619
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
you do not associate me

620
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
with sports games titles often

621
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I'm not really an expert on them

622
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
but there are a few sports game titles I do

623
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
enjoy, and most of them have to do from when I was

624
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
younger and so forth, like

625
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
things like Blades of Steel and the original

626
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
NBA Jam, so when I heard there was a new one I wanted to play it

627
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I damn near bought the one that was on the Wii

628
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I'm so glad I didn't now, because I don't know, I just

629
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
didn't have a lot of fun, but I think

630
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
that would be a game that would be more interesting

631
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
when you're actually in the room with other people

632
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
because that was the other great thing about NBA Jam

633
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
that's the game we all played, you know, at

634
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
sleepovers and stuff growing up

635
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
when we were at the arcade, so

636
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I think to sit there and play it by myself was

637
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
a little bit of a snore fest, especially when I was just

638
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
getting frustrated with my characters, and I was just like

639
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
eh, I'd like to go play something

640
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
else now, thanks

641
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
so, um

642
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
then the other game I played this week

643
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
so

644
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I spent quite a bit of time

645
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
this week with

646
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Final Fantasy XIV

647
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I, after the phone call

648
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
last week, Mikolatov

649
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
pestered me and pestered me, and

650
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
finally I decided to buy the game on Amazon

651
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
because I found it for like 25 bucks

652
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
new, because you know it's pretty easy to find right now

653
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
and I got

654
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
the game, it took me

655
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
a while to install, that was the first

656
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
thing that pissed me off about it, because my

657
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
DVD was borked or something where my drive

658
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
wouldn't even read it, I had to dump all the

659
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
files to Alan's computer, because his drive

660
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
could read it, transfer it to my USB

661
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
drive, then install it off the USB drive

662
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
then it had to patch

663
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
so four hours later, I'm finally in this game

664
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
and I'm playing it, and

665
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I will say this, you know, obviously we've

666
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
razzed the game quite a bit on the show before

667
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
because it was a dreadful launch, and nothing

668
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
is ever gonna change that, it's always gonna

669
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
be looked at as one of the most

670
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
horrific, horrible launches in gaming

671
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
the question I think that's on everybody's mind

672
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
now is, is the game any better now?

673
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
and I would say the answer is, yes

674
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
actually, the game is a lot better now

675
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
it's, the combat

676
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
mode makes a lot more sense

677
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
the game itself

678
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
graphically is really good looking

679
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
just

680
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
really gorgeous looking

681
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
sceneries, and some of the cutscenes

682
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
are really good, especially in the beginning

683
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
here's where the game suffers most now

684
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
at this point, is that I think

685
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
the game's biggest problem is that

686
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
like 11, it is really

687
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
not friendly to new players

688
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
and I think they've tried to

689
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
improve the tutorial a little bit

690
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
because I sense that there's been some things added

691
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
with that, but there's still a lot of

692
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
what the hell do I do now

693
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
going on in that game? it doesn't

694
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
really quite handhold you the way

695
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
that WoW does for the first few levels

696
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
and I had to take a lot on myself

697
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
to go research wikis

698
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
and fan sites devoted to the game to figure

699
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
out like, how do I get better

700
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
armor?

701
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
or where is the damn

702
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
auction house? you know, like these are things

703
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
that the game doesn't really help you with

704
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
and I realize that a lot of people

705
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
that are gonna defend Final Fantasy 11

706
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
and Final Fantasy 14 are gonna say, well that's

707
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
part of the game, these games are not WoW

708
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
you're supposed to figure these things out, that's the challenge

709
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
and I'm here to tell you, most people aren't

710
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
gonna fucking have the patience for that

711
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
that's fine

712
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
if, you know, the select elite

713
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
smart few wanna, you know, go ahead and

714
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
be all into it or whatever

715
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
but without a significant

716
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
amount of people supporting the MMO, the MMO

717
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
is not really gonna last

718
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I definitely notice

719
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
there's a lot less people playing this game than there was

720
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Final Fantasy 11 when I was playing it, I noticed that

721
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
right off the bat too, the server seems

722
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
a lot more empty than 11

723
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
but to the game's credit, again

724
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
it's gorgeous, the battle system's

725
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
interesting, I like what the

726
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
I really like how they've handled

727
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
the mixture of jobs now

728
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
like if you level one class

729
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
like a conjurer and then you level another class

730
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
like a Thermaturge, you can take

731
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
the spells you've learned as a Thermaturge and apply

732
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
it to when you're a conjurer, so it's like

733
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
you're building, everything is like your own

734
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
custom class that you've built of spells

735
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
and abilities mixed together from the other classes

736
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
that's cool, I mean, so

737
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
there are things I do like

738
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
about the game and where it's going

739
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
that reminds me a little bit of

740
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
7, remember with 7 you, you know

741
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
you'd get the different spells

742
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
from the

743
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
what was it, Espers? Is that what they

744
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
called them? I don't remember

745
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Espers or whatever and you would

746
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
apply those in there and then

747
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
you can transfer those out and learn something else

748
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
it's kind of like that and you can

749
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
basically at the end, everybody had everything

750
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
the guild levs

751
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
or the little questing thing that they put

752
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
into it, you really can

753
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
do a lot with a very limited

754
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
amount of time, like I have noticed

755
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
you can get in there, do some levs and you know

756
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
you've gained some experience and you feel like you've done

757
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
something for the day and that's kind of

758
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
nice, like that's something 11 never really had

759
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
is that you had to sit around

760
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
find a party

761
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
okay, maybe we'll gain some experience

762
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
hopefully somebody does that, I mean

763
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
even as a white mage

764
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
sometimes you'd struggle a little bit

765
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
but the nice thing is there are things you

766
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
can do by yourself and the things that

767
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
they've done, especially with the crafting

768
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
the whole fact that crafting is its own

769
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
job system with its own quest even

770
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
I thought I was

771
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
going to really hate that at first, but I realized

772
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
it gives you so much to do

773
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
playing alone

774
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
that 11 never really had, at least back in

775
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
its heyday, keep in mind my frame of reference for Final Fantasy

776
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
11 is up until about

777
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Treasures of Aurgon, I never played after

778
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
the Wings of the Goddess, well I played a little bit

779
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
of that expansion but never the

780
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Abyssia or any of this stuff, like level sinking

781
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
I was already gone by the time that came out, so

782
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
keep in mind my frame of reference is a few years dated

783
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
in the game

784
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
now here's the other thing, and I know you guys

785
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
are probably waiting for me to mention this because there's been a lot

786
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
of talk about this this week, Final Fantasy

787
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
14 had a lot of major announcements to it

788
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
this week, one of them being, of course

789
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
the day the game shows up in the mail

790
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
for me, what's the big announcement?

791
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
We're going to start charging monthly for this game

792
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
hahaha

793
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
alright

794
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
and then they were previewing a lot of what they plan

795
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
to do in 2.0, and granted, a lot

796
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
of it sounds really cool, it looks sexy

797
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
as far as, the screenshots look great

798
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
they're incorporating the old school

799
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Final Fantasy more into it, which I

800
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
think is great, I really like what they've

801
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
got planned out for Final Fantasy 14

802
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
2.0, it's going to be very

803
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
interesting and almost something unprecedented in

804
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
gaming, where can this game be

805
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
rescued? And it's going to be

806
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
really interesting to see if they're successful or not

807
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
but the fact that they're

808
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
going to start charging people when the game

809
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
is admittedly halfway done

810
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
is a little weird to me, and I'm going to be honest

811
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
right now

812
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
at this moment, in my point of mind, if they were to

813
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
start charging for this game tomorrow, probably not going to

814
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
pay for it, I'll enjoy my 30 day trial

815
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
period, and then be done with it. I got a lot going

816
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
on in Warcraft and other MMOs that I play

817
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
But, and it's not even

818
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
going to be done until what, 2013?

819
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
The end of 2012 I think is when the

820
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
big, big expansion is supposed to hit. Okay, 2013

821
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
But, well, here's the other thing too

822
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
you have to remember Final Fantasy 11

823
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
it didn't come out in America at first, it was only out in

824
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Japan, and when it came out in America

825
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
we essentially got Final Fantasy 11

826
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
2.0, because we had Rise of the Ziller

827
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
included with our release

828
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
when it came out, so it gave them time to work out the

829
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
kinks, but now that that didn't

830
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
happen this time, and everything was kind of released

831
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
at once, it does make me feel like I'm still playing

832
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
this big alpha or beta test of a game that's not

833
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
done, and now they want to charge me for it?

834
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Like, I realize they're trying to

835
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
recoup on some massive losses

836
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
on this game, but

837
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Not my problem. I kind of

838
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
think they're in for a rude awakening

839
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Like,

840
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
the amount

841
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
of failure of this game

842
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
is just

843
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
whew

844
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
It is epic fail

845
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
in every sense of the term

846
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Now, I think it's going to be really neat if the game

847
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
can salvage itself, and I gotta

848
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
be honest, a lot of what I'm seeing online

849
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
and a lot of this plan, and I

850
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
like that now they're being

851
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
open with their customer base

852
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Now they're talking more, now they're laying out a plan

853
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Like, I think they realize they've fucked up in a

854
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
big, big way

855
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
I mean, for the president of Square Enix to say

856
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
this game tarnished the Final Fantasy

857
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
brand, one of the biggest

858
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
and longest running franchises in gaming

859
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
history, that is like

860
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
not something to just blink at

861
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
That's huge

862
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Especially a Japanese company to say that

863
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
So

864
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
But I think if the game

865
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
kind of keeps moving on this path

866
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
I mean, it's definitely gone in the right

867
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
direction

868
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Real quick, sorry, I listened

869
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
I went back and listened to how I first

870
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
described my Final Fantasy XIV experience

871
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
and I called it fucking garbage

872
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
That was exactly how I reviewed this game when I played the beta

873
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
It is no longer fucking garbage

874
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
But it's not an amazing

875
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
game that I want to pay money to play

876
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
every month. It's

877
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
It's pretty good. It's alright

878
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
It's on its way. It's getting better

879
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
But, see, what's the point if, like

880
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
why would I start paying for

881
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
this game when they're like, oh, it's not

882
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
really going to be done until next November

883
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
or, you know, the end of

884
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
the next year? Okay, well fine

885
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
I'm not going to pay for it until the end of next year

886
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
That's when I'll pick it up. It's like

887
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
why even announce that and then start charging?

888
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
All you're going to do is just get people to

889
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
quit. I mean, you may get a few people

890
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
that are die hard that are just going to

891
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
I'm going to level up my characters while we're doing this and stuff

892
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
while you're working on it

893
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
But I think a lot of people that were just like

894
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
oh, well, it's free right now. I'm just not

895
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
going to pay for it. But now that they're going to start charging

896
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
I'll just wait

897
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
and play something else and then I'll come back to it

898
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
in a year or so

899
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
But at that time, who the hell

900
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
knows what Blizzard is going to have at that

901
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
time? I mean, fuck, how many more

902
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
MMOs are going to come about

903
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
by the time that they're ready to launch 2.0

904
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
It's not going to matter

905
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
And a really good one is going free to play

906
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
And we've got

907
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Swartar on the horizon

908
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
at the end of December. We've got

909
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Guild Wars 2 next year that has a lot of people

910
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
riled up. There will

911
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
be a WoW expansion. By that point

912
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Blizzard will have announced their next

913
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
MMO

914
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Yeah, you're right. It's getting a little crowded in the MMO space

915
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
I think what's going to end up happening is it's just going to go

916
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
free to play. It's got to. I mean,

917
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
that's the trend right now and a lot of these

918
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
suffering MMOs end up going that way

919
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
But then again, they're Square Enix and they're fucking

920
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
stubborn, so maybe just

921
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
let it rot and die

922
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
I would love to read

923
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
a behind the scenes book on Final

924
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Fantasy XIV. Like, this is a

925
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
this is a game for

926
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
better or for worse, this is a game that will go down in history

927
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Absolutely. Absolutely.

928
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
And we're watching it unfold right now

929
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Alright, let's move on

930
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
to some quick housekeeping

931
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
before we get into the gaming news for the week

932
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Quick, quick housekeeping. Please add us on Facebook

933
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
be our friend. Facebook.com slash

934
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Orange Lounge Radio. We're also on Twitter at

935
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R and

936
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
got to say this, don't forget to

937
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
vote for us in the podcast award. We are a

938
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
finalist for best gaming podcast

939
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
at www.podcastawards.com

940
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
We won this award

941
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
the very, very first year

942
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
which was 2005 and

943
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Dark Sakura now has her duffy hat

944
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
sitting on the trophy. Yes, I do.

945
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
I'll take a picture.

946
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Yeah, we've got that and

947
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
we would be honored to win it again

948
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
but there are a lot of great shows

949
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
in the finals but the promotion

950
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
that we could get for winning would be

951
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
great and as you know

952
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
we don't have a lot of big dollars

953
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
or ways to advertise our program

954
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
We don't have any big dollars. Yeah, actually

955
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
we have no money whatsoever so we really

956
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
rely on word of mouth as we say at the end of every show

957
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
so please, please, please take

958
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
a moment to go vote for us in the podcast

959
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
awards and don't forget you can

960
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
vote every day between now and the

961
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
24th? 27th.

962
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
27th, thank you. And the winners

963
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
will be announced what, early November probably.

964
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
I don't think there's actually an award

965
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
ceremony this time though. I remember the first year

966
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Dark Sakura went to an award ceremony where she sat

967
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
behind him. I was so sick too.

968
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
But um,

969
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
yeah, we would be honored to win again

970
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
and it would be pretty cool. I think we would be the only show

971
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
to have won the award like what, six years apart?

972
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
But, you know,

973
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
it's been an honor just to be

974
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
nominated. Alright.

975
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
That being said, we fucking

976
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
want to win. And also on

977
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Facebook you can check out

978
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
we've got a little banner

979
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
art thing that you can put in your signature

980
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
on whatever forms

981
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
you happen to visit and stuff to help

982
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
promote, you know, voting.

983
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Don't, don't spam people, but

984
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
at the same time, like, please, people you know

985
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
like, tell them, like, we, we really

986
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
do need every vote because

987
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
every show, and you probably,

988
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
you probably have a couple of the podcasts that are finalists

989
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
in your listening rotation, as you should.

990
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
There's a lot of great shows that were nominated.

991
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Um, and there, you're probably gonna be hearing

992
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
this to death throughout the next couple weeks.

993
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
But, you know, it's, it's really

994
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
um, promotion from winning

995
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
it can't be beat. So,

996
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
it'd be great. Alright, uh,

997
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
let's move on and talk about the

998
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
gaming news. So,

999
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Loki, why don't you start us off.

1000
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Um, of course you know there's a new fall

1001
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
dashboard update coming to the Xbox 360

1002
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
to kind of make it look a little bit like, uh,

1003
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Windows 8 or, um, you know,

1004
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
the Windows phone and that kind of stuff. Personally

1005
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
I think it looks stupid, but, you know, whatever, that's

1006
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
I don't really have a say in it. I got an

1007
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
update, you know, on the 25th of November

1008
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
when this actually goes live.

1009
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Apparently it's gonna be using a modified

1010
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
version of Silverlight

1011
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
if you care to know how it works.

1012
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Honestly, I don't really

1013
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
care myself, but it's supposed

1014
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
to, you know, do a lot of integration. Obviously

1015
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
they're gonna have, you know, more Kinect support

1016
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
and, um, you know, the live TV

1017
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
stuff. Also, you're gonna be able to

1018
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
do the, um,

1019
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
you know, the, uh,

1020
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Bing searches and all

1021
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
sorts of stuff to find different content on there.

1022
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
And, um, I believe there is also

1023
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
a, uh,

1024
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
if you wanted to, I decided to

1025
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
opt out of it this year. Um,

1026
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
a beta participation to,

1027
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
you know, test the dashboard early.

1028
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Uh, honestly wasn't a big fan of

1029
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
having to update twice a day every single

1030
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
day until the launch of the actual dashboard, so

1031
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
I passed on that.

1032
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
But, uh, that was available shortly

1033
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
and I believe, uh, the

1034
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
submission, uh, for the beta program

1035
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
has been closed already. And,

1036
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
um, yeah.

1037
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
And of course, you know, for those keeping

1038
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
track, 25th also is Black Friday.

1039
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
So.

1040
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Busy, busy, busy.

1041
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Oh my gosh, that's rolling out on Black Friday?

1042
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Yup. That's a recipe

1043
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
for disaster.

1044
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Maybe. That sucks for those employees.

1045
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Cause you know Microsoft's gotta be fully

1046
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
staffed for a day that something like that goes live.

1047
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
They'll have to work on Black Friday.

1048
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Well, they will at least have

1049
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
their stomach full of turkey.

1050
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
And, uh, they will be, uh,

1051
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
be ready to take those. Loki always looking

1052
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
at the bright side. You know what,

1053
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
you know what an awesome thing to do is on Black Friday?

1054
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Go to a theme park.

1055
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Cause they're empty. I don't know about Disneyland.

1056
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Disneyland's always kind of the exception of the rule, but I will say, like,

1057
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
I went to Magic Mountain a couple years ago, it was empty

1058
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
on Black Friday. Black Friday and Super Bowl Sunday.

1059
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Best days to do that stuff.

1060
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Anyway.

1061
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Uh, as far as the fall dashboard goes, are you

1062
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
excited for this? No. That's about to roll. No?

1063
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
No, I hate the way it looks. You don't like

1064
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
it? I, I dislike it.

1065
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Windows 8, you know what, when that comes

1066
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
out, I am fucking turning this shit off.

1067
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
So it looks like back, you know, back to

1068
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Windows 7, 95

1069
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
XP, whatever you want to call it.

1070
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
You know, I don't like this crappy,

1071
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
oh look at all these panes of information.

1072
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Yeah, you know what panes of information are?

1073
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
It's more advertising space.

1074
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
That's all this fucking is. And I

1075
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
don't care about the ads that are on there already.

1076
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
So why would I want to see more of them?

1077
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
There are things I like and things I

1078
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
don't like. Um, but as far as the

1079
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
dashboard goes, I, I, I

1080
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
have not been a fan of NXC

1081
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
or whatever this current one we're on is called.

1082
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
I just, I hate the way it's laid out.

1083
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
And I like the fact that this new one is

1084
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
going to have all the searching built into it for

1085
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
like, hopefully it works for like options

1086
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
and things like that too. Like, change

1087
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
my gamer pic. I hope I can

1088
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
yell that at my Kinect and it'll understand me.

1089
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Um, because like honestly

1090
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
part of the NXC and part of the frustrating

1091
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
stuff in that is that you

1092
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
sometimes like honestly can't find

1093
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
the one simple thing you're trying to change in your settings

1094
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
because they're like all over the place. So

1095
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
hopefully this has that a little more

1096
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
streamlined. But as far as like being like a

1097
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
streamlined entertainment box,

1098
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
well shit, that's where they're all going now anyway.

1099
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
But I think the next, the next

1100
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
generation of consoles, just

1101
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
you wait how streamlined

1102
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
those things are going to be with your other

1103
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
entertainment stuff. You know, but see, I'm, I'm cool

1104
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
with the fact that they're going to have content on there

1105
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
and I would, I would like to

1106
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
believe that it's going to be free, but I don't like the fact

1107
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
that it's tied in with like my cable provider

1108
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
because I mean granted

1109
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
right now with Comcast I have the most basic

1110
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
basic basic cable possible. I don't

1111
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
think I even have on demand or anything like

1112
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
that, but I don't want

1113
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
to have to have Comcast cable

1114
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
in order to access, I mean I would love to get rid of

1115
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
cable period. Keep the

1116
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
internet of course, but and just have

1117
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
access to this stuff.

1118
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Maybe not necessarily the stuff that's on

1119
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Comcast because if I want to watch on demand

1120
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Comcast stuff, I'll just

1121
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
go to Comcast

1122
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
and watch on demand. I mean there's a ton of

1123
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
different ways to do that. I don't need to actually

1124
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
hook up my console to do the same thing you're going to do on my

1125
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
TV. It just doesn't make any sense.

1126
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
I've actually really given thought to just cutting

1127
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
my cable loose because I just,

1128
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
I barely watch any TV.

1129
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Ours is linked to our internet so

1130
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Well yeah, so is ours, but I mean

1131
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
still if we could even save 20 bucks a month

1132
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
shutting it off. That's the thing though is as we did that

1133
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
we cut out phone and we also cut out

1134
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
cable, well we were going to

1135
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
cut out cable and just keep the internet, but they had a plan

1136
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
that was $2 more for cable.

1137
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
It included, so I was like okay fine

1138
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
we'll do cable too. It's a good thing

1139
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
too because my plan was, oh I'm just going to get one of

1140
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
those antennas and hook it up. Yeah I bought one of those

1141
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
antennas last night, they fucking suck.

1142
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
They do not tune in shit. And so

1143
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
I got nothing and the only time I did get to

1144
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
tune in the channel it was so messed up.

1145
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
When you have cable internet you kind of have to

1146
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
have at least basic cable, right?

1147
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
I don't think any of the companies will sell you.

1148
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
No, you can get just the internet.

1149
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Really? I always thought you had to have at least

1150
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
It's more expensive, but

1151
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Like local channels plus CNN, bare minimum.

1152
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
No, you don't have to, but

1153
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
like I said there is a deal that they have right now

1154
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
and you can get it for I think

1155
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
they gave it to us for about $2

1156
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
more a month and I was like

1157
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
you know what I can do that and

1158
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
since Comcast doesn't have any

1159
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
contracts it's like well fuck at the end

1160
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
of the year just cancel so

1161
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
or at the end of one year it's time

1162
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
we can just cancel so who cares.

1163
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Ron's 006 in our chatroom at

1164
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
chat.orangestop.com says they know

1165
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
people don't want cable much and so

1166
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
they will bundle it to force people to buy cable

1167
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
to get internet. Yeah, I think that's exactly

1168
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
what's happening.

1169
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
I'm sure these companies know. Well all they're doing is

1170
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
raising the prices of, you watch

1171
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
they're going to start raising the prices of a lot of

1172
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
internet. Alright, well let's

1173
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
move on to some other gaming related stories and

1174
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
speaking of rising prices

1175
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
these next little few stories

1176
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
have to do with the online pass. Yes, that's

1177
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
right. What once was Project

1178
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
$10 is now becoming the standard

1179
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
and if you don't believe me look at what they're doing in some

1180
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
big releases coming out.

1181
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Catwoman in Batman Arkham

1182
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
City, obviously this is a huge release

1183
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
that's out, what, this week? Is this week?

1184
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Tuesday. Tuesday.

1185
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
It's actually on my friend's birthday. Big week.

1186
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Well Arkham City is coming out and

1187
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
here's the deal, if you want to play as Catwoman

1188
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
you need to have an online pass.

1189
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
One of them will come with

1190
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
the game of course and you buy it new

1191
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
that's the whole deal is that you always do get it

1192
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
included new but if you end up

1193
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
buying the game used you will have to

1194
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
purchase the VIP pass for

1195
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
800 Microsoft points or

1196
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
$9.99 on PlayStation Network so

1197
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
you know 10 bucks or however you slice it there.

1198
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
They are quick to say that

1199
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
playing as Catwoman is not required

1200
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
to complete the game but

1201
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
come on we all want to see Catwoman in

1202
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
that outfit. Not entirely true.

1203
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Well there's more, hold on, hold on.

1204
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
There is something else going on there too

1205
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
and that is a deal with

1206
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
a company called

1207
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
the Evil G

1208
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
which is a major major major

1209
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
gaming retailer in America.

1210
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Yes. We call the Evil G

1211
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
and apparently there is an agreement

1212
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
with Evil G where

1213
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
supposedly, this is an internal memo

1214
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
that all customers that will purchase

1215
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
the game used there

1216
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
will be given a free code that will be

1217
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
on the receipt. So

1218
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
in other words Project $10

1219
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
won't apply if you buy the game

1220
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
used at this one retailer

1221
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
who has their hand

1222
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
firmly on the balls of all gaming

1223
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
publishers around the world. I bet you

1224
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
you're going to see there's a lot more titles because they have

1225
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
they have the strength and buying power

1226
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
to say listen bitches you're going to

1227
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
give us codes for all these games.

1228
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
And that's how they're going to get around it.

1229
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Does that hurt?

1230
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Everybody else.

1231
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Or if you're like me

1232
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
who gives a fuck

1233
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
about Catwoman. But here's the gross part about it.

1234
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
It's already on the god damn

1235
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
disk. It's just locked away behind

1236
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
a code because they're assholes

1237
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
is what it is. So you know what?

1238
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Fuck them. Don't buy the game.

1239
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Either don't buy the game

1240
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
or just don't fucking play as Catwoman.

1241
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Who gives a shit? Tigerclaw in the chat

1242
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
room points out there are Riddler trophies

1243
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
that you can only get with Catwoman. Exactly.

1244
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
That was the part I was going to bring up.

1245
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Yeah. So if you want 100% complete.

1246
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
You gotta play as Catwoman.

1247
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Now granted if you buy the game

1248
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
new you're not losing any of this.

1249
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
You're not going to lose it. It's that but

1250
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
you know this is just

1251
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
that trend and by the

1252
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
way speaking of trend

1253
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Electronic Arts

1254
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
mentioned this week that Battlefield 3

1255
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
will also have an online pass.

1256
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Battlefield 3 kind of a big game coming

1257
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
out pretty soon. Just a little

1258
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
title you might have heard of it. Battlefield 3

1259
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
right? And this was all confirmed on

1260
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Twitter.

1261
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
A user tweeted a guy working

1262
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
for EA. Do you need to buy a

1263
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
new Battlefield 3 to pay on Xbox

1264
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Live? And the response was you can

1265
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
purchase an online pass for a used

1266
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
copy. So I mean as if it wasn't

1267
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
confirmed that this shit is now the norm.

1268
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
And it's the first game that they've done

1269
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
that it's not a sports game either.

1270
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Oh. I did not pick up on

1271
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
that so. And

1272
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
obviously going to be a huge huge

1273
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
title no matter how you slice it. Yeah. I'm not surprised

1274
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
and I think that mainly is just to stop

1275
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
piracy because it's going to be a big game

1276
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
that's going to be pirated. It's also and to be fair

1277
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
you know for what it's worth this is also going to be

1278
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
a big title because you're going to have

1279
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
tons of people who buy it new

1280
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
and they will not this will all be

1281
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
transparent to them it won't matter they get the code with

1282
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
the game. So

1283
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
it's only for those people that are waiting to save a few

1284
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
bucks by buying a used copy that won't really

1285
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
be saving any money. Well just wait a little longer and I'm sure

1286
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
by then GameStop will have the code for

1287
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
you for free you know.

1288
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Because they've worked out some sort of deal.

1289
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
All right. Shadownext

1290
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
in chat says buy a game new and support

1291
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
the industry if you do that the online passcodes

1292
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
are not an issue. I'm sorry once again

1293
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
yeah I understand buying new and stuff it

1294
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
supports the industry and stuff and I hear

1295
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
people saying well if you buy used

1296
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
the developer doesn't get any money

1297
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
listen you stupid idiots

1298
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
okay. The developer gets paid

1299
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
when they fucking press the goddamn disc

1300
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
it can sit on a goddamn warehouse shelf

1301
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
in EA, Activision, you name it

1302
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
and the developer is still getting

1303
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
fucking paid for that shit. So the

1304
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
fact that they're complaining that

1305
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
we didn't sell another

1306
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
new copy now our servers

1307
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
gonna go down because we have less people

1308
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
paying for it. No listen there's

1309
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
exactly the same amount of people playing on those goddamn

1310
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
servers as new copies that were sold.

1311
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
You can't magically create two copies

1312
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
out of one without you know some sort

1313
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
of piracy. So I'm just so

1314
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
and I think we all agree that

1315
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
piracy is a no no. Yeah piracy

1316
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
is bad but that is really the only thing

1317
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
I'm sorry used games do not eat

1318
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
into that.

1319
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
It's just it's so stupid.

1320
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
I'm with you and I'm not.

1321
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Here's my whole thing and again it's

1322
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
the movie industry and I think what's good enough for the movie

1323
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
industry is good enough for gaming and the movie industry

1324
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
hasn't like died because of used games.

1325
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
And you know there's always gonna

1326
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
be game rental services and things like this

1327
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
and I think there's just there's enough people

1328
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
that want these games new the day they

1329
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
come out. Yeah but see there's a lot of stuff

1330
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
you don't understand preordered Skyrim

1331
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
you know there's a lot of things that you don't

1332
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
know about the movie industry too. They don't like

1333
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
used product. In fact red box used

1334
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
to have to you know they used

1335
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
to sell off their used movies when they were done

1336
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
renting them and then you know those would get

1337
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
in turn sold to stores or whatever to

1338
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
be bought. And now through the

1339
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
exclusive deals in order to get the product into

1340
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
those machines even though a lot of them are really terrible

1341
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
deals they have to destroy all that product

1342
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
because they're afraid of the used sales

1343
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
eating into their new sales. And the same thing actually

1344
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
happened with the original runs of Hummers.

1345
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
It's just like... No seriously

1346
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
not the Hummers but the Humvees through the military

1347
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
the first run of them you could

1348
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
convert them into Hummers for sale.

1349
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Wow. But then they actually

1350
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
when they decommissioned them they had to destroy them.

1351
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
So that they wouldn't be sold.

1352
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Same thing goes with

1353
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Warner Brothers for example Warner Brothers

1354
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
they just instilled a 60 day

1355
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
rental window on all titles.

1356
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
That's for everybody.

1357
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
You know before they used to have it

1358
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
where it was just Redbox

1359
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
and stuff now it's everybody and I heard

1360
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
something I think they may even do at some

1361
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
point it's going to be six months once

1362
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
the rumors is going to be

1363
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
turned into six months once

1364
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
all these contracts are up.

1365
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Yeah they hate

1366
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
the used industry but they're the only ones

1367
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
so far that are kind of going to the

1368
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
extreme. But once

1369
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
again though I'm sorry I don't

1370
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
yeah I understand that people

1371
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
buying used or whatever

1372
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
are going to be

1373
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
affecting the amount of new copies that a store

1374
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
brings in because if you have like 60 used

1375
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
copies you're not going to be bringing in a lot of

1376
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
new copies and so yes that would eat at your

1377
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
bottom line a little bit. But

1378
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
the people that sell back those used copies

1379
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
take that money to buy new fucking

1380
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
games that you may be producing.

1381
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
So the fact that you're just

1382
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
stopping people from buying new games

1383
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
there's only a finite

1384
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
amount of money these gamers are going to have

1385
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
and if you're taking away that avenue for them

1386
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
to sell it back used and

1387
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
trade in to get a new game that you might be

1388
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
making so that you can get your fucking commission

1389
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
check then people are going to

1390
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
buy less games overall so

1391
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
you're just hurting yourselves. That's really all it's

1392
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
going to end up being. I guess

1393
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
at the end of the day most of the

1394
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
games I buy I buy new so it really

1395
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
doesn't end up affecting me but she kind of

1396
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
can't help but go

1397
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
they're going to make a buck wherever they can.

1398
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
But am myself directly

1399
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
is this going to change my game buying habits?

1400
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Probably not. But I will

1401
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
say that there's like I kind of

1402
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
noticed that this year I really am cutting

1403
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
back and maybe it's just the economy or what have you

1404
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
I really am kind of cutting back on

1405
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
the games I plan on buying new. Like

1406
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
I go back a couple years and

1407
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
there you know I probably would have bought a lot of games

1408
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
over the holiday

1409
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
season but this year I really can't

1410
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
think of a lot that I'm going to buy. I'm not even sure

1411
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
I'm going to buy Dance Central 2.

1412
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Like because I'm really questioning like am I really

1413
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
going to play it that much? Probably not.

1414
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
So I'm only buying those games

1415
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
I know I'm going to play a lot.

1416
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
And that would be Skyrim

1417
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
this year. Final Fantasy 13 2

1418
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
next year. You know kind of a lot

1419
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
of the big RPGs.

1420
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
So I don't know.

1421
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Saints Row the Third.

1422
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
That will probably have enough. See that's one of those

1423
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
games where I might want to check it out used.

1424
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
That will have a pass I'm sure but here's the best

1425
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
part about Saints Row the Third.

1426
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Welcome they've got system link. I don't need to go

1427
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
on your fucking internets.

1428
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
I'll just play it local.

1429
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
I don't need your internets.

1430
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Alright let's move on we've got lots more stories to tackle

1431
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Dark Saga.

1432
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
There's actually something on my oh there we go.

1433
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Something on my microphone.

1434
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
How about Wii stuff? The new

1435
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Wii bundle. Wii!

1436
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
It's going to have new Super Mario Brothers

1437
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
but it's going to lose something very important

1438
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
to a lot of people. GameCube support.

1439
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
No more GameCube. Sorry.

1440
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
We're pulling a Playstation.

1441
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
So this is like our version

1442
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
of what Europe got

1443
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
at the Gamescom or whatever right?

1444
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Pretty much.

1445
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
It is going to have though

1446
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
actually the system itself

1447
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
is black.

1448
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
It has a black Wiimote Plus

1449
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
and a nunchuck and

1450
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
a Super Mario Galaxy soundtrack.

1451
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
And it's going to be out on October

1452
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
23rd for $150 bucks.

1453
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Isn't $150 bucks

1454
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
what a Wii cost right now?

1455
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Yes it is.

1456
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Alright. And they say that

1457
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
the Mario Kart bundle is going to

1458
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
still be available along with the new one.

1459
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Is that true Loki?

1460
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
You're like half shaking

1461
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
half not. Yes it's true.

1462
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
I think they're going to sell the old ones until they run out of stock.

1463
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
I'm not doubting what Dark

1464
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Sakura is saying but I'm like okay really? Is that really

1465
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
the long term plan? Is that really?

1466
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Dan and I back in the day

1467
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
went through the entire

1468
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
supply of

1469
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
PlayStations, DualShock Systems

1470
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
at KB Toys

1471
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
by where I worked

1472
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
so that we could find the one with the port in the back

1473
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
because our old one was dying.

1474
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
People are that anal

1475
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
and will try to find the ones

1476
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
that have got what they want in it.

1477
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
People still want a Playstation 3 that will play PS2 games.

1478
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
I've got one. I have one

1479
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
that will play PS1.

1480
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Well they all play PS1. I know but mine will play PS1

1481
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
PS2. It's

1482
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
the whole thing.

1483
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Which one of the games I didn't mention I played this week

1484
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
I actually put in old school PS1

1485
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
games on my Playstation 3.

1486
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
One of the random games I played this week was like

1487
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
the 30 Activision game collection.

1488
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Oh my god. Like going back and

1489
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
playing it now I'm like god this is some sloppy

1490
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
ass packaging and like what are these like

1491
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
LSD influenced title menu graphics?

1492
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Like I can't even. You know what

1493
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
I've had the urge to go back and play? What?

1494
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
Jumping Flash. Like

1495
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
plug it in and go play it like in the front room.

1496
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Awesome. And give myself a seizure.

1497
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
But yeah. So

1498
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
people will

1499
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
they want the old one look at the old one. They don't care

1500
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
then. I mean it really doesn't matter to me

1501
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
I've got a GameCube. But

1502
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
it's nice you know having it all in one.

1503
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
I hope at this point

1504
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
everybody who is interested in this

1505
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
kinda already got

1506
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
a Wii. Like I can't imagine there's gonna be

1507
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
lots of people that are like left out in the cold

1508
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
so to speak.

1509
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
But it's still weird

1510
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
like the math behind it is what's weird

1511
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
to me. If it's cheaper it'd make like

1512
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
$129 or something or $125.

1513
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Even a $20

1514
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
cut in the price tag would have

1515
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
helped you know like make this

1516
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
make sense. Or like

1517
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
new Super Mario Brothers and maybe

1518
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
like Super Mario All-Stars or

1519
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
something like that. You know that limited run game or something.

1520
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Well there's a little bit more and actually this is

1521
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
for Europe specifically.

1522
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
In November there's gonna be a bundle

1523
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
that's Mario and Sonic at the London 2012

1524
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Olympic Games and it's

1525
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
blue. But it's the same

1526
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
GameCube free

1527
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
edition.

1528
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
The horizontal. The vertically challenged

1529
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Wii. Yeah. Essentially.

1530
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
The

1531
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Wii.

1532
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
The not so Wii. I just I don't

1533
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
understand

1534
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
it's the PSP Go again.

1535
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
It's like hey we got this new

1536
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
system that's coming out and it's got less

1537
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
feature. No it's not that bad. It's not that bad.

1538
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Again I think most people

1539
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
that give a hoot about GameCube compatibility

1540
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
already got one. Like

1541
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
but still the math just doesn't

1542
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
make sense. If you're a gamer

1543
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
they're literally cutting it out for no

1544
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
reason than maybe they plan to sell

1545
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
the games on the Wii U.

1546
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Which I'm sure is the that's really

1547
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
the long term thing we're looking at.

1548
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
That's why they're cutting it now. Because they know on the Wii U

1549
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
they want to sell the GameCube games. Just wait.

1550
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Just wait. Oh it's gonna happen.

1551
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
But

1552
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
it's still though. I mean if you're looking for

1553
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
you could probably just get the Mario

1554
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Car thing. And hell I'm sure you could probably

1555
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
if you really didn't want Mario

1556
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Car you could probably trade it in someplace and

1557
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
get New Super Mario Brothers. I mean

1558
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
I'm sure a lot of stores have it. It's

1559
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
a popular game and I'm sure

1560
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
a lot of people have traded it in. But

1561
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
just

1562
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
I don't understand.

1563
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
You might need the GameCube controller for something else

1564
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
later on. Here's a

1565
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
crazy random question. Do you think these new

1566
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Wii's are being done to combat a lot of

1567
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
the modding that people are doing to their Wii's?

1568
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
I think so. Because I think a lot of that modding

1569
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
stuff runs off of files

1570
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
that were part of the GameCube.

1571
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Like the Dole files or

1572
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
whatever. Now

1573
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
I'm understanding why

1574
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
they just are slowly taking that out. Like

1575
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
if that's part of it. That

1576
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
makes a lot more sense now why they've removed it.

1577
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
It's akin to

1578
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
PlayStation 3 deleting the other OS

1579
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
support but without all the hubbub. Because

1580
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
you know

1581
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
this is a physical thing. Nintendo can't

1582
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
come to my house and take the GameCube compatibility

1583
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
out of my existing Wii.

1584
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Yeah. Or they couldn't but that wouldn't be

1585
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
good for them. Yeah. Not a good idea.

1586
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
That would require

1587
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
releasing

1588
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
like an online patch which

1589
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Wii is very limited in what they're able to do.

1590
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
Yeah.

1591
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Alright. Anyhow. Let's move on

1592
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
with some more news, Loki.

1593
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
So they're gonna have some new

1594
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
as you may remember the Halo

1595
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
HD remake. The Halo

1596
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Combat Evolved Anniversary Edition.

1597
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
They're gonna be doing some sort of

1598
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
like. Oh I'm sorry.

1599
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
I'm reading the wrong story. Stupid me.

1600
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
I was like what the hell are you doing Loki?

1601
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Let's talk a little bit about

1602
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
the PlayStation Network.

1603
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
The OLR host compatibility has been

1604
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
removed out of Loki in the most recent

1605
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
upgrade apparently. Yes. Exactly.

1606
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
So there's

1607
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
not really

1608
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
the PlayStation Network hasn't really been compromised

1609
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
but some of the data or

1610
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
whatever that was grabbed from

1611
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
the PlayStation Network the last time

1612
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
has been used to try to compromise

1613
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
the PlayStation Network again I guess.

1614
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
So basically a lot of user accounts

1615
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
I wanna say it was like 75,000

1616
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
or something like that

1617
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
were locked out because

1618
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
people have been trying to attempt

1619
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
or attempting to sign in using

1620
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
login and password information that were

1621
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
obtained of one or

1622
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
more compromised lists

1623
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
from other companies sites or sources

1624
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
so I guess they're like trying

1625
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
to login using your

1626
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Hotmail, Google or whatever

1627
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
sites happened to leak

1628
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
out some information

1629
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
and I'm wondering if maybe that has

1630
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
something to do with also

1631
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
the Xbox Live users

1632
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
which we're still getting a lot more of those now

1633
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
finally being reported.

1634
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Much like

1635
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Sky had a problem with

1636
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
people breaking into his account

1637
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
and spending money on FIFA shit

1638
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
there's been a lot more people

1639
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
talking about it and

1640
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Thank you Gaming Press for covering this a month

1641
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
after it was news. Yes

1642
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Ars Technica actually started

1643
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
reporting a lot of people

1644
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
actually

1645
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
telling them that say hey

1646
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
my game account was hacked and

1647
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
they bought

1648
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
FIFA 11 and also

1649
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
the Gold Pass or whatever

1650
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
spent $100 on my account

1651
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
and there's been a lot of

1652
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
other things people are starting to see

1653
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
FIFA 12 and

1654
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
purchases are kind of related to that

1655
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
and

1656
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
of course sure enough

1657
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
all of my Microsoft points that were stored on my

1658
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Xbox Live account had been spent on

1659
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
in game items for FIFA 11

1660
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
I don't own that game, hell I don't even like

1661
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
soccer games and whoever spent

1662
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
my Microsoft points had tried to purchase more

1663
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
presumably when the purchase failed

1664
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
they abandoned my account and went to steal from some

1665
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
other unsuspecting gamer

1666
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
and yeah I think that's kind of the case so

1667
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
of course you know change passwords

1668
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
hopefully that's enough

1669
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
and of course Microsoft

1670
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
when pressed for a statement

1671
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
they were saying we do not have any evidence

1672
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
of the Xbox Live

1673
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
service that has been compromised

1674
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
we take our security of our

1675
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
service seriously and work on an ongoing

1676
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
basis to improve it against

1677
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
any evolving threats

1678
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
however a limited number of members have contacted us

1679
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
regarding unauthorized access to

1680
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
their accounts by outside individuals

1681
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
we are working with our impacted members

1682
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
directly to resolve any unauthorized

1683
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
charges to their

1684
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
accounts as always we highly recommend

1685
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
our members follow the Xbox Live

1686
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
account security guidance provided

1687
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
at Xbox.com slash security

1688
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
What a lovely sanitized response

1689
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
from the Xbox media relations

1690
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
department what a lovely

1691
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
sanitized response because some

1692
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
could mean a million

1693
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
I mean I get it Microsoft does not

1694
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
want to panic on their hands like what Sony had to

1695
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
go through but you know they're trying to

1696
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
poo poo this and make it sound like it's not that many people

1697
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
when I've known at least

1698
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
at least 12 people that this has happened to

1699
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
And you just read the comments and like

1700
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Do you know how many people I've known that have had their PlayStation accounts hacked?

1701
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Zero

1702
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
And I mean hacked for like money

1703
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
or false charges

1704
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
And you know on this story there's

1705
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
109 comments and a lot of them

1706
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
are saying

1707
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
yeah hey are any

1708
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
let's see here

1709
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
um

1710
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
where we go here

1711
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
my account was hacked yesterday I'm getting the standard

1712
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
25 day lockout treatment I'm also

1713
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
disputing the charges on my

1714
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
credit card

1715
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
see here on July

1716
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
10th the same thing happened to me

1717
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
um

1718
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
let's see here

1719
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
a couple of people I know

1720
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
have had this happen

1721
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
so there's a lot of people that are like saying

1722
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
hey this has happened to me and stuff and that's why

1723
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
you know they even kind of made a comment on the story

1724
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
hey uh

1725
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
you know there's been a lot of people that have been writing us saying

1726
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
hey the same thing has happened to me

1727
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
so yeah it's a little bit of a pattern there

1728
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
a little bit gotta figure it out

1729
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
cause

1730
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
and why is it FIFA players?

1731
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
And why is it 30 days that your account

1732
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
remember guys I didn't play my Xbox for a month

1733
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
and I made some purchases

1734
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
on Playstation 3 instead during that time of things

1735
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
I might have bought on the Xbox 360 instead

1736
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
you know so just

1737
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
I think their whole process

1738
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
needs to be fixed that's another big problem

1739
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
Microsoft does some very shady

1740
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
online things that they do you know not just

1741
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
there's the whole credit card removal thing too

1742
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
anyhow

1743
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
as a pain in the ass I refuse to give them my new

1744
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
card I will not give them my new card

1745
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
info cause my last one just expired they will

1746
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
not get my new one they'll still try to charge it though

1747
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
and then when

1748
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
they will still try to charge it good luck

1749
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
they will

1750
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
they will lock out your account until you

1751
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
give them a new card so you need to cancel

1752
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
I will close my Xbox account if it

1753
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
comes to that I'm going on record

1754
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
saying that they are not

1755
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
getting my new credit card number if they

1756
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
were able to

1757
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
I will turn in my seven year

1758
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
whatever it is Xbox Live membership

1759
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
I'm done if that's the

1760
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
case let it be known

1761
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
there's a lot of stuff I see where people will

1762
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
change their credit card and then

1763
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
they'll cause they'll try to renew

1764
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
and then it doesn't auto renew and so

1765
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
they give them a new card to charge it and then

1766
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
they'll charge another year on there and they get two

1767
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
years instead of one

1768
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
see that shit's shady like there's

1769
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
there's a lot of shady shit going on right now

1770
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
in all this Xbox

1771
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Live stuff and I think we need some answers

1772
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
and stop with this

1773
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
corporate speak

1774
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
you should be able to get out of that stuff

1775
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
this is why people are fucking mad at corporations right now

1776
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
by the way not to go on a tangent that I

1777
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
really don't want to go on on this program but

1778
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
this shit is why people are mad

1779
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
this is why people are mad

1780
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
yeah because you can't take out your credit card you have to call

1781
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
their customer service to remove your credit

1782
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
card information off your account I don't

1783
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
think that should be I think you should be able to do it

1784
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
right away just delete it right out

1785
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
oh boo hoo you can't get the

1786
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
can't auto renew because it's so fucking hard to

1787
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
remove your you know account information

1788
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
alright moving on to a story that you didn't

1789
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
hear anything about just 10 minutes ago on this program

1790
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
some changes are coming to Halo

1791
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
Anniversary talking

1792
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
about the Kinect functionality some of the details

1793
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
came out this week at New York Comic Con

1794
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
there's going to be the feature to

1795
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
analyze enemies

1796
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
meaning that you can like actually talk to your

1797
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Kinect and go into the library

1798
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
or something like that and look at I don't know

1799
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
your enemies I guess

1800
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
lore or something I don't know

1801
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
what do you need to know about Halo enemies

1802
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
shoot to kill, shoot to kill

1803
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
enhance, enhance

1804
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
and now you're going to be able to shout grenade

1805
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
and your character will

1806
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
throw a grenade

1807
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
amazing and reload weapon

1808
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
we'll also do that too oh that's so much quicker than

1809
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
pushing a button how many times can you shout

1810
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
grenade versus how many times can I

1811
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
push the button this is just all

1812
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
showy shit that you'll

1813
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
never use well it's just like the past showing

1814
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
your friend like look at this grenade

1815
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
oh and this is only

1816
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
possible through Kinect

1817
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
they even said oh you can't do this

1818
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
with like a headset this is only possible

1819
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
through Kinect who gives a fuck

1820
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
and also you know

1821
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
before this the

1822
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
only other thing that they said that you could use your Kinect for

1823
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
was switching between classic

1824
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
and HD mode I want

1825
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
to play classic I want to play HD

1826
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
why would I need to do that on the fly

1827
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
who cares

1828
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
that's not a full price game

1829
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
so

1830
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
alright that's

1831
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
again Halo anniversary edition

1832
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
like in another year probably would have bought

1833
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
the game new but this year just not

1834
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
not enough into it

1835
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
to really want to buy it sorry

1836
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
maybe I'll rent it

1837
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
there won't be an online pass

1838
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
because it's Microsoft huh

1839
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
and if they try to do the online pass they're

1840
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
going to get really they're

1841
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
in a tricky spot

1842
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
they're already charging for an online pass

1843
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
and have been for years

1844
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
alright anyhow Dark Soccer what do you got

1845
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000

1846
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000

this game's coming out sooner than I thought it would

1872
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000

01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
this was going to be like holiday next year

1874
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000

1875
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000

1876
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000

or fourth rugby game that's coming out on

1961
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000

to Evil G2? Yeah, the last

1963
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000

Don't get your own, rugby's cool, but

1966
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
It's cool, but that's a lot of games

1967
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
I bet there's more games than there are football games

1968
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000

1969
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000

Is that just

1974
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
I think it's like the Pokémon

1975
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
Wasn't there a Pokémon Rumble or Arena

1976
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
game or something like that in the Nintendo 64

1977
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
GameCube? I think it's just like a fighting

1978
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
game, sort of

1979
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
with Pokémon characters

1980
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
I don't know, I don't play Pokémon

1981
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
What?

1982
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
It doesn't matter

1983
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
Just curious

1984
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
It's the only 3DS Pokémon game that's coming out

1985
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
There can be a lot of Pokémon

1986
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
It's like saying, you know, Mario Tennis

1987
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
is the only Mario game available this holiday

1988
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
And that's it

1989
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
That's everything

1990
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000

2001
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
Moving on to the Playstation 3

2002
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
I imagine you'll see a lot of that same stuff

2003
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
Just on the Playstation 3

2004
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Yep, Dead Island, Deus Ex, FIFA 12

2005
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000

That is coming out this week

2012
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
What is this? Is this like a

2013
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
Oh, it's the movie and the game

2014
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
That's why it's a Hybrid Pack

2015
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
Yeah, it's the movie and PlayStation Network game

2016
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
Yeah, it's like a Blu-Ray

2017
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
So it comes with the Blu-Ray and it comes with the game

2018
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
It goes with it, so it's like an all-in-one pack

2019
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
That is out on the Playstation 3

2020
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000

2021
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000

01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
Is this with branding on it?

2032
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
Yeah, this has some branding for Uminico no Nakakoro

2033
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Lastly

01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000

01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
Busy week over there

2069
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
Just a few more stories for you guys

2070
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
and then the classic game of the week

2071
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
But first, Loki

2072
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
Microsoft has bought Twisted Pixel

2073
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
Of course they just recently put out

2074
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
a few games for the Xbox 360

2075
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
including Explosion Man

2076
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
and The Gun Stringer

2077
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
also Ms. Explosion Man

2078
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
and

2079
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
basically Microsoft is a very big company

2080
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
Twisted Pixel, a relatively

2081
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
small developer

2082
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
We're very interested that they get to stay

2083
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
who they are and they get to retain the

2084
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
magic that they have as a

2085
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
small indie and also we'd like to

2086
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
leave the golden goose alone so to speak

2087
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
So basically they're going to

2088
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
be able to do kind of what they

2089
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
want but still have some financial

2090
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
backing to go with that, maybe some

2091
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
better projects because they'll have a little bit more to

2092
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
work with

2093
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
So that's kind of cool because they're definitely a unique

2094
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
developer

2095
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
I mean it's not too surprising, I kind of

2096
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
already thought they were in bed with Microsoft

2097
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
because hasn't all their shit been exclusive anyway?

2098
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
Um

2099
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
I don't know about that

2100
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
I think they had some stuff that was

2101
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
on PC but

2102
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
yeah, I think for the most

2103
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
part it's been exclusive to

2104
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
Microsoft, probably the Microsoft

2105
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
Well PC still counts if it's for Windows

2106
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
Yeah, that's true

2107
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
So they can still develop for that

2108
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
Um, I'm wondering

2109
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
if they're about to be trusted with some big

2110
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
Microsoft franchise to make a game for that

2111
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
Or I don't know, maybe Microsoft

2112
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
just wants a piece of it You just don't have a lot of big franchises

2113
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
anymore though, I mean

2114
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
the thing about it is just Halo

2115
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
and Forza

2116
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
and Fable I guess

2117
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
but they're not touching Fable I know that

2118
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
Um, who knows

2119
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
there could be something new in the works They could make anything

2120
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
better than Fable 3, that'd be great

2121
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
A new cameo game

2122
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
It could be something new for the new system too

2123
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
you know, there's got to be

2124
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
stuff under development for the new Xbox

2125
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
and we've heard a lot of rumblings about that

2126
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
you know, whatever it may be, so maybe

2127
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
because these guys did

2128
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
you know, Explosion Man and all that

2129
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
they're tasked with making some

2130
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
must have game on the new system

2131
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
who knows, who knows, just throwing it out there

2132
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
I mean there's always new franchises, they can come up with

2133
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
something unique and brand new

2134
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
so sequels

2135
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
Alright, let's see

2136
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
one more story for you guys

2137
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
for this half of the show and that is about

2138
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
Ubisoft delaying a game

2139
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
called Rocksmith

2140
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
You familiar with Rocksmith?

2141
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
That's alright, a lot of people aren't

2142
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
Rocksmith is the game that like, it has like the real

2143
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
guitar with it, which I kind of thought

2144
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
Rock Band 3 was supposed to kind of cover that

2145
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
but I guess Rocksmith

2146
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
is supposed to be more like you actually

2147
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
see the frets on the screen, it's a lot

2148
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
lot different kind of the way it's presented

2149
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
Oh, I think this is the game my friend was working on

2150
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
Oh really? Well, it's been delayed

2151
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
and now it's going to be launched in 2012

2152
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
in Europe, and I guess

2153
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
this is because of some complaint

2154
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
that was against

2155
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
Ubisoft

2156
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
Yeah, filed by a band named Rocksmith

2157
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
Oh, how funny

2158
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
So I guess now there's a whole ugly thing that's got to be

2159
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
settled around that

2160
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
Court documents say that the dispute could

2161
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
go through February 2012

2162
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
so until that's resolved

2163
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
this game is delayed

2164
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
Unless you happen to buy a PS3 version

2165
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
which is region free

2166
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
Oh, okay

2167
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
I mean, if you're really in a hurry, but

2168
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Is the game not coming out here in America?

2169
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
Yeah, it comes out next week

2170
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
It's just, you know, we don't have a band named

2171
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
Rocksmith over here, and they're over in Europe

2172
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
There you go

2173
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Alright, well, let's stop talking about

2174
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
these newfangled games

2175
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
and let's go back to the classics

2176
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
Every week on this show, Darkstalker

2177
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
dives into the gaming vault and finds a game

2178
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
that she thinks, hey, listen

2179
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
you kids and your Rocksmith

2180
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
you need to go back and study

2181
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
this classic game from the archives

2182
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
the way games used to be

2183
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
Darkstalker, what's the classic

2184
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
game of the week?

2185
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
Castle of Illusion starring Mickey Mouse

2186
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
because we talked about it last week and I started

2187
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
thinking about it, so it's this

2188
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
In Japan it was known as

2189
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
Castle of Illusion I Love Mickey Mouse

2190
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
Great Wonderland Castle Adventure

2191
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Really long name, huh?

2192
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
And it came out in 1990, and it was on

2193
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
the Mega Drive slash

2194
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
Genesis, developed by Sega of Japan

2195
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
and it was

2196
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
one of the

2197
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
parts of the games that were released

2198
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
right before Sonic Hedgehog came out

2199
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
And I love this game, so

2200
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
shut up. It's a side-scrolling

2201
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
game, and you play as Mickey Mouse

2202
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
and he has to save Minnie from

2203
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
this evil witch named Mizrebel

2204
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
who wants to steal Minnie's youth

2205
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
because Minnie apparently is

2206
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
young and pretty

2207
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
And who I believe was not actually

2208
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
a Disney villain otherwise though, right?

2209
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
I don't think so

2210
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
This is interesting that they didn't use

2211
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
a quote-unquote real villain, but anyway

2212
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
You know what?

2213
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
No villain is as awesome as Maleficent

2214
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
the damn diva

2215
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
So, moving forward

2216
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
You play in the castle, and you have to

2217
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
defeat different enemies and bosses by jumping

2218
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
on them, which makes you jump higher

2219
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
And you get apples and marbles to use as

2220
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
projectiles, and you get health

2221
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
boosts and extra lives or

2222
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
bonus points, and then after you beat the

2223
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
boss, you're given a gem. When you get all

2224
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
of the gems, you build a rainbow bridge

2225
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
that lets Mickey walk into the castle

2226
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
so you can fight the witch in the tower

2227
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
And her, uh

2228
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
Now, I need to double check this

2229
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
reference because it says that her younger version

2230
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
looks like the evil queen

2231
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
from Snow White

2232
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
It does kinda look like

2233
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
Yeah

2234
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
Who knows? Maybe it is her

2235
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
It also did come out on the Master System

2236
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
but they redid it

2237
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
And so the Game Gear version is actually exactly

2238
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
like the Master System version because it's one

2239
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
of the ones that ran in Game Gear

2240
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
One of the Game Gear games that ran

2241
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
in Master System compatibility mode

2242
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
So, um

2243
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
I mean, there's not really a whole lot to say about it

2244
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
It's a cute game. It's got some good challenge

2245
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
to it. It's fun

2246
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
Um

2247
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
I mean, Rob, you're looking

2248
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
at it, right? Yeah, it's a fun little platformer

2249
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
You know, I didn't own a Genesis when I was younger

2250
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
But I do remember, I remember there was kind of

2251
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
a stink because this came out around

2252
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
maybe a year or two after the NES

2253
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
had Mickey Mousecapade

2254
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
Which was kind of their big game

2255
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
And Capcom had the Disney license for Nintendo

2256
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
though. They weren't really putting stuff out on

2257
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
Genesis at the time. In fact, wasn't Capcom's

2258
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
first Genesis game, the Street Fighter

2259
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
Championship Edition? I think it was

2260
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
I think so. I seem to remember that

2261
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
from my gaming history

2262
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
Well, the Street Fighter 2 came out before

2263
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
Championship Edition

2264
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
Well, no, but remember the Genesis one

2265
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
The Genesis got the Championship Edition

2266
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
It was like a big freaking deal

2267
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
But then the Super Nintendo got Turbo Championship Edition

2268
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
So it kind of went back and forth

2269
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
But anyway, my point is that I do remember

2270
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
this game. I never played it when I was younger

2271
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
because I didn't own a Genesis

2272
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
But I remember wanting to because I thought

2273
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
Gosh, this game looks a lot better than Mickey Mousecapade

2274
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
Which actually was a pretty sweet

2275
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
NES game. Yeah. I don't know if you've done

2276
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
that as a classic game of the week before, but if you haven't

2277
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
it should be someday. Well, this one

2278
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
actually, I don't know if I've ever told you about

2279
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
the week I traded my SNES for my friend's

2280
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
Genesis and

2281
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
Master System Converter

2282
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
This is one of the games I borrowed

2283
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
Oh, nice. And I had

2284
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
a field day with this game

2285
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
I loved it so much. I mean, there's

2286
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
so much more to do. I mean, not just

2287
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
you had the, you know, the

2288
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
jumping boosts and you had swinging

2289
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
from vines. Just graphically

2290
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
this game was really pretty to look

2291
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
at. You have to remember again, guys, this was a long

2292
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
time ago this game came out. But some of these

2293
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
environments, like this level that we're watching

2294
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
Mickey in here on the YouTube right now, in

2295
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
this like spider web

2296
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
where he's floating on leaves

2297
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
Like for a game of this era, it looks

2298
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
fantastic. It's like paintings

2299
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
You know? And that was the first thing

2300
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
that really got me is just like, oh it's

2301
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
so pretty and look how rich the colors

2302
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
are and blah blah blah blah blah

2303
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
You're climbing up a tree

2304
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
I think this is a very important Genesis game. It really is

2305
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
Well, um

2306
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
There was a sequel

2307
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
Sorry, I was just going to say weird that it's never shown up on

2308
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
any collection. I mean, I understand probably the Disney

2309
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
licensing probably has a lot to do with that

2310
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
Well, now they've licensed, though

2311
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
Disney took the license for Castle Illusion

2312
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
Oh, that's right. That was recent

2313
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
I remember that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, okay

2314
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
And we don't know what they're doing with it. Right, right

2315
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
Right. Probably just sitting on it for a while

2316
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
I hope there's like maybe like a

2317
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
newer version of this coming out. That'd be awesome

2318
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
Well, let me go a little bit

2319
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
further then. Sure, sure. Okay, well

2320
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
first of all, there was a sequel named Land of Illusion

2321
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
that came out of the Master System into Game Gear

2322
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
and then Castle Evolution was re-released

2323
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
in 1998 in Japan as

2324
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
the Sega Ages Mickey Mouse and Donald

2325
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
Duck on Saturn

2326
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
and that also included Quack Shot

2327
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
which is a very

2328
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
interesting game on its own, too

2329
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
So, uh, there you go

2330
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
It did have a re-release in Japan

2331
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
Alright

2332
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
Very cool

2333
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
There it is, your classic game of the week

2334
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
Castle of Illusion starring Mickey Mouse

2335
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
for the Sega Genesis. Nice pick

2336
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
Thank you. Alright, that's gonna do it

2337
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
for part A of our big show tonight

2338
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
but don't go anywhere. We're not done

2339
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
We've still got half a show to go. We've got a lot of news

2340
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
coming out in the next half of the show

2341
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
and gonna get to your emails as well

2342
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
at mailbagatorangelaundry.com and

2343
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
twitter topics and hopefully, I'm hoping

2344
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
some people will call us that went to

2345
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
our Comic Con cause I know we've got several

2346
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
people that went cause I wanna hear about

2347
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
Bungee Ferret Tossing which by the way, did you

2348
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
did you see the art on twitter?

2349
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
I don't know if you've seen this. Sorry. No. Some art was

2350
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
released of the main character

2351
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
in Bungee Ferret Tossing officially

2352
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
now named Fernando of the French

2353
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
Canadian Army. Yes. So

2354
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
I will, uh, you haven't seen that fan art?

2355
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
I'm gonna look. I'm gonna go to

2356
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
YYR's twitter. He's like, it's like

2357
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
YYR underscore or maybe the other way

2358
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
around, underscore YYR. It's one of the two

2359
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
and he has the artwork in one of his previous tweets.

2360
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
It's awesome. So anyhow, we'll talk

2361
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
with you guys in the skype line as well

2362
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
as plenty more news when we come back with more

2363
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
of Orange Lounge Radio. Don't go anywhere.

2364
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
Welcome back everybody to Orange

2365
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
Lounge Radio. We are

2366
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
live on this Sunday evening.

2367
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
October the 16th of 2011.

2368
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
I'm out of breath. That was such a fast

2369
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
break. Where we're

2370
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
of course taping another episode of our show. Episode

2371
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
number 432 to

2372
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
be exact. I was showing

2373
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
Dark Soccer the picture of Fernando

2374
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
during the break from Bungee Ferret Tossing which

2375
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
I guess we're gonna get some calls during part B.

2376
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
Some people are already private messaging

2377
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
me in chat wanting

2378
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
to talk about the game. So we're gonna hear more about it

2379
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
later. But. Awesome.

2380
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
Do you approve of Fernando?

2381
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
I do. I do too. I'm gonna have to draw.

2382
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
My favorite is the ferret with the tongue

2383
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
hanging out of his mouth like ahh dead ferret.

2384
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
I feel like drawing the ferret.

2385
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
The question is when's Ronma gonna

2386
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
cosplay that?

2387
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
It's just

2388
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
a matter of time.

2389
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
Alright look. You're gonna have to bulk up

2390
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
for it though cause Fernando looks pretty ripped.

2391
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
So I'm just saying. I don't think

2392
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
it's gonna be that hard for Ronchon. He was a

2393
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
marine.

2394
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
Alright. Let's move on to some

2395
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
rapid fire news. Every night we like

2396
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
to or every night that we do a show anyway we like to

2397
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
go through some news quickly cause we don't have

2398
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
a whole lot of time. It's not a six hour show.

2399
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
But we do want to bring to your attention

2400
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
a few other things going on in the gaming world.

2401
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
We do need another marathon show. Speaking of marathons

2402
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
I gotta mention this. I can't believe I didn't show all this

2403
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
somewhere else. I need to mention this. Need to need to need to.

2404
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
Extra Life happened this past weekend

2405
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
and congratulations. They

2406
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
broke a million dollars. That is outstanding.

2407
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
And I know we had some members of the

2408
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
OL army that participated in Extra Life.

2409
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
So. The moment you announced that Shermie started

2410
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
licking her bed in excitement. At least

2411
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
she didn't shit the bed. That's good. So she approves.

2412
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
Like licking is like shitting is for the tester.

2413
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
Now she's licking her pond.

2414
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
Well she was until you decided to look.

2415
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
So she approves of the fact that Extra Life

2416
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
raised that money. That is flippin

2417
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
fantastic. And I'm sorry we couldn't participate

2418
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
ourselves but you know we are

2419
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
thinking about charity in the back of our mind

2420
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
and maybe what we can do later on.

2421
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
Also speaking of charity

2422
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
the date for the new Umlaut I think

2423
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
was announced previously but

2424
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
just to reiterate it's December 8th this

2425
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
year and it's gonna be flippin

2426
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
huge. Like I

2427
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
can't say too much. I may or

2428
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
may not know some things

2429
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
but it is on Thursday December 8th and

2430
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
it's gonna be awesome.

2431
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
Awesome.

2432
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
So if you are like anywhere remotely near

2433
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
the San Francisco Bay Area you need to make plans

2434
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
to attend. If you are

2435
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
nowhere near the San Francisco Bay Area

2436
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
you still should keep the day open.

2437
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
Just saying. Moving on.

2438
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
Let's go through some

2439
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
quick quick news. Loki.

2440
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
This is quite appropriate and I'm actually kind of

2441
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
psyched to play it cause this is more of a puzzle game

2442
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
than it is a crashing game.

2443
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
But Burnout Crash is gonna be

2444
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
coming to the IOS both on

2445
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
iPad and

2446
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
iPod or iPhone

2447
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
or whatever. So you can

2448
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
check that out. I think that's actually

2449
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
a pretty good fit for it because

2450
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
yeah like you said it's more of a puzzle game

2451
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
and kind of disappointing.

2452
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
But still fun. Still fun.

2453
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
So check that out.

2454
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
No word yet on when it's coming.

2455
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
This holiday season they say.

2456
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
Anytime between now and the end of the year.

2457
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
This is kind of cool.

2458
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
There's gonna be a free to replace

2459
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
Shadowrun game coming.

2460
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
And it's an online

2461
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
MMO. I guess originally

2462
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
you know I guess

2463
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
the game was supposed to be inspired by Counter Strike

2464
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
but now it kind of

2465
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
I don't know it's more top down. It looks to me

2466
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
like one of the old

2467
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
Fallout games or something like that.

2468
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
They're calling it kind of

2469
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
Baldur's Gate with

2470
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
Jagged Alliance but

2471
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
I think it's awesome because honestly

2472
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
the last Shadowrun game that came out in 360

2473
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
was terrible so this

2474
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
this is more like it.

2475
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
And it's free to play so

2476
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
cool. And it's being made by

2477
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
Sixth World I guess.

2478
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
I don't know if they're

2479
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
no Sixth World was the last one

2480
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
I'm sorry. Cliffhanger is the one that's

2481
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
putting this together now.

2482
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
Oh god. That's gonna be awesome.

2483
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
No word yet on what's coming out but

2484
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
Shadowrun definitely has its fans.

2485
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
And you know there's been some hit and miss games

2486
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
in the Shadowrun universe so this sounds neat.

2487
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
It looks cool. I mean it could be a franchise

2488
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
if done well. It would be

2489
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
successful so. Neat.

2490
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
And then last but not least of course

2491
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
PopCap. They're always

2492
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
putting out gamer

2493
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
crack if you will. They have a new

2494
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
game coming out

2495
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
called Popcorn Dragon.

2496
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
And in Popcorn Dragon you

2497
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
shoot fireballs to make popcorn

2498
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
that a dragon then attempts to eat.

2499
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
They're saying it's kind of like a popcorn

2500
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
fruit ninja with a cute mythical beast.

2501
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
That sounds so PopCap.

2502
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
Like when you describe it I'm like god

2503
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
that just sounds like a PopCap game.

2504
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
To be fair I don't think we've really

2505
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
heard of anything that that studio has done for a while.

2506
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
I mean their last big big game was Plants vs.

2507
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
Zombies. That was some time ago.

2508
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
Well they have to port it to every single platform.

2509
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
Bejeweled 3.

2510
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
Oh yeah shit I forgot about Bejeweled 3.

2511
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
You're right you're right you're right.

2512
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
And then it wasn't technically PopCap.

2513
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
The spinoff studio.

2514
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
I really wish they'd do more stuff because

2515
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
unpleasant horse is fucking amazing.

2516
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
But

2517
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
yeah they had a few things.

2518
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
This looks alright. It looks like it could be cool.

2519
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
And I do like

2520
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
Popcorn and dragons.

2521
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
So it'll be worth checking out.

2522
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
That's the quote they're gonna put on the box.

2523
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
If you like popcorn.

2524
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
I do love popcorn and dragons.

2525
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
It just made me think about having

2526
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
a little pet dragon and watching a movie

2527
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
and going dammit I want to pop

2528
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
this popcorn.

2529
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
Who doesn't love popcorn

2530
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
and dragons? Terrorists that's who.

2531
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
You know what I don't like popcorn.

2532
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
Really? Because the corn kernels get stuck

2533
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
up under my gums and it hurts.

2534
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
Without fail.

2535
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
I guess that's a fair but you like dragons.

2536
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
Yes.

2537
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
Because dragons will smite my enemies for me.

2538
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
So you're not completely evil.

2539
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
I guess I can see that in Popcorn.

2540
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
I do get annoyed with popcorn kernels too.

2541
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
Would it be my weakness?

2542
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
And people at work who can't cook popcorn

2543
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
with dam.

2544
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
And end up making the whole building smell like

2545
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
burp popcorn.

2546
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
I love burnt popcorn.

2547
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
I purposefully burn my popcorn.

2548
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
Just say her.

2549
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
You are the office asshole.

2550
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
My desk was like

2551
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
two rows from the break room.

2552
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
So it would smell like this burnt shit all the time.

2553
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
Whereas I was perfect.

2554
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
And I had

2555
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
our crappy microwaves.

2556
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
You were perfect?

2557
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
As for popping popcorn at work.

2558
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
I had our crappy microwaves timed

2559
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
that I could always do the perfect

2560
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
container of popcorn with only a couple

2561
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
of kernels left at the bottom and nothing burnt.

2562
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
The end.

2563
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
I follow the directions

2564
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
completely but I know when to pull

2565
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,000
it out so that it has...

2566
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
You know when to pull out?

2567
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
Yes. I know when to pull the popcorn out

2568
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
of the microwave.

2569
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
Oh you.

2570
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
You adolescent

2571
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
children. You know how to pull it out when the explosion

2572
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
is just right.

2573
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
Hey I don't want to singe anything

2574
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
in there so.

2575
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
I have to make sure. With that dragon of yours.

2576
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
Cause you know.

2577
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
Cause if you leave it in too long

2578
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
it's just gonna be waffen smoke

2579
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
all over the building so.

2580
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
You just have to know when to take it out.

2581
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
And then it stinks all day.

2582
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
Exactly.

2583
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
This is the clip I want them to play

2584
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
at the podcast awards.

2585
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
But yeah.

2586
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
What started it was

2587
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
I had bags of

2588
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
non buttered popcorn that people gave me

2589
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
and it was just nasty.

2590
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
You have to burn it a little bit to give it a little bit of a

2591
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
smokey taste to it.

2592
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
Just enough.

2593
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
It doesn't smell too bad.

2594
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
Okay as gross as the story is

2595
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,000
and as non-video gaming related as the story is

2596
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
I have to tell it. I'm like kind of the opposite

2597
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
of you Loki. Burnt popcorn

2598
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
not really a fan. But what I'm a

2599
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
total fan of and can't get enough of

2600
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
are like the barely popped kernels.

2601
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
Like the kernels that have popped a little bit

2602
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,000
but are like

2603
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
not all the way popped.

2604
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
I will pull a microwave. I'll pull out

2605
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
early.

2606
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
Just to get a bag full of those

2607
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
because those are the

2608
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
delicious kernels in my opinion

2609
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
are the ones that are like barely popped. Of course they're also the worst

2610
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
for your teeth but whatever.

2611
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
So. Alright.

2612
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
Moving on to non

2613
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
dragon related things.

2614
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
Only us can you know

2615
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
take a pop cap game and turn it into

2616
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
pulling out.

2617
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
Alright moving on.

2618
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
Do you hear these sounds in the background?

2619
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
This is the sound

2620
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
of BurgerTime on Xbox Live

2621
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
Arcade.

2622
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
That's right. BurgerTime Xbox Live Arcade

2623
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,000
it has a release. It is November

2624
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,000
2nd is when this is coming out.

2625
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
And look it's kind of an old

2626
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
OLR in joke. It hasn't come up a lot lately

2627
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
but I really defend the old

2628
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,000
arcade classic BurgerTime

2629
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
is vastly underrated. It's a great

2630
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
game. I actually

2631
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,000
contrary to popular belief I don't really believe

2632
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,000
it's like the best arcade game ever made.

2633
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,000
But it's a fun one. And it's underrated.

2634
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
And I have to admit this looks pretty cool

2635
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
what they're doing with the whole like round

2636
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
platforms and the graphical upgrades.

2637
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
Hopefully it retains some of that charm of the original

2638
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
and I'm really excited to try multiplayer.

2639
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
So I will get to do all that

2640
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
on November 2nd because that's what

2641
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
the release date is according to Monkeypaw Games.

2642
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
Who's making it?

2643
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
Infinity Blade of course very popular game

2644
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
on the iOS platform. I have yet to play it.

2645
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
I don't know why I've been dodging it.

2646
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
But very popular.

2647
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
It is actually going to be coming to arcades.

2648
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
That struck me as very interesting.

2649
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
But Infinity Blade FX

2650
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000
is making its way to

2651
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
I guess Dave and Busters

2652
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
and other

2653
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
types of facilities

2654
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,000
like that. So it's kind of cool.

2655
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
Apparently though they have other games that they've

2656
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,000
ported with us like Fruit Ninja.

2657
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
Flight Control is the other one.

2658
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
Any game that has a big old

2659
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
touch screen they say 46 inches

2660
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
is going to have this.

2661
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
They're saying it's going to be in all

2662
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,000
57 Dave and Busters locations

2663
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
of which we have a brand new one here in Roseville

2664
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,000
not too far away. So Dark

2665
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,000
Sakura we might have to go to Dave and

2666
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
Busters on assignment for the show.

2667
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
Ok let's do it.

2668
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
We'll make that sacrifice. By October

2669
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
28th so we'll have to go just after that to

2670
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
make sure that the game is there. And then I can finally

2671
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
play Infinity Blade be it in arcade form.

2672
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
One other story before

2673
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
I turn it over to Dark Sakura and that has to do with

2674
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,000
Leisure Suit Larry. Ok look before

2675
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,000
they ruined it like 5 years ago

2676
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
with the versions that were on the regular Xbox

2677
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
and Playstation 2. Leisure Suit Larry

2678
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
was kind of an epic game like

2679
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
back in the day. Not actually by Epic

2680
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
it was by Sierra. But anyway it was a great

2681
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
adventure game back in the day. Well Leisure Suit Larry

2682
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
in the land of the lounge lizards

2683
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
is being remade.

2684
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,000
That is the original game in the series.

2685
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
They're remaking it with an HD

2686
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
upgrade for the series 25th

2687
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
anniversary which is coming up at the

2688
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
end of 2012. Surprisingly

2689
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,000
enough it's not Telltale doing

2690
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,000
it. Which I would have thought

2691
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
point and click adventure game surely this is

2692
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
Telltale is doing. No it's actually being done by somebody

2693
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
else. It's being done by Replay Games

2694
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
and this is very important. Al

2695
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
Lowe who did the original

2696
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
series this has his blessing

2697
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000
and he's working with them on it.

2698
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
It should be noted the games

2699
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
that came out within the past 5 years

2700
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
he had nothing to do with. And in fact

2701
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
he was kind of a bitter

2702
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
betty about them and I can't say I blame him.

2703
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
In fact listen to this quote

2704
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
to EGM that he said

2705
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
quote I'm overjoyed to see Larry released

2706
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
from his digital dungeon after all this

2707
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
time and be placed in the hands

2708
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
of someone who understands him and

2709
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
wants to see him brought back to

2710
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,000
the forefront by people who love him and

2711
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
understand him. That's what we call

2712
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
subtly throwing shade.

2713
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,000
That's also a little redundant.

2714
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,000
A little bit but. Well you may remember

2715
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
that Leisure Suit Larry before was released

2716
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
by Venvedi

2717
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
Universal who put out wonderful

2718
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
franchise killing games

2719
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,000
like the Spyro series, the Crash

2720
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
series and of course the Leisure Suit Larry

2721
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
series.

2722
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
Thank you and guess who bought Venvedi

2723
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
Universal? Activision.

2724
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
See where we're going

2725
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
here? Well they must have not optioned to

2726
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,000
continue this series and after the last couple games

2727
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
I can't imagine why. So now Replay Games

2728
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
picked it up. What's cool about this, Replay

2729
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
has said that if they're successful they're

2730
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
going to keep doing these HD updates

2731
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000
through all the original games.

2732
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
So that's kind of rad.

2733
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
They're also planning on some new games.

2734
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
So let's just hope it

2735
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
doesn't suck.

2736
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,000
Moving on, DarkSakura.

2737
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
Well, how

2738
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
about some stuff about the Nintendo DS?

2739
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
No, I don't want to hear it.

2740
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
Okay. There has

2741
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
been over 50 million

2742
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
units sold in the US.

2743
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
And this was

2744
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
numbers presented by Nintendo.

2745
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
That's 7 years

2746
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
post launch, still selling, and

2747
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
like I said, 50 million

2748
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
units. I wonder if that includes 3 DS's

2749
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
because technically it's kind of part of the DS

2750
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
family. It says and its variants.

2751
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
Okay, there you go.

2752
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
Also, for Ultimate Marvel

2753
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
vs. Capcom 3, there

2754
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
is going to be a playable Galactus mode.

2755
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
That's pretty cool.

2756
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
You can just have him

2757
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
smack people with his bitch slap and

2758
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
his flick attack, I guess.

2759
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
You know who else I saw on there, by the way?

2760
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
Phoenix Wright. Yeah, I heard about that too.

2761
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
Phoenix Wright's in it.

2762
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000
Pretty cool.

2763
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
Is it bad that I thought he was in the original one?

2764
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
I did not play the original one.

2765
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
They put in Frank West.

2766
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
That's awesome. Frank West is

2767
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
awesome. I love that character.

2768
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
I mean, that's kind of a why, except

2769
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
I guess he's pretty cool, you know.

2770
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
And then last but not least, Star Wars

2771
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
The Old Republic has a European

2772
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
release date. It will be out on the 20th of December.

2773
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
Two days earlier than

2774
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
it was announced. Yeah, I was going to say they bumped it up a little bit

2775
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
because it was supposed to be a

2776
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
variance. Just a teens.

2777
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
In MMO speak, three days

2778
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
is a big deal, so it's nice that

2779
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
Europe got parity with that.

2780
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
In fact, the 20th for

2781
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
them starts earlier than it

2782
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
will for us, so now we're getting shafted.

2783
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
Oh, Rob.

2784
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
Alright, it's just one day.

2785
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
It's not a big deal.

2786
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,000
Alright, so

2787
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,000
let's get back into some more long

2788
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
form news. Of course, coming up

2789
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
later in the show, the mailbag at

2790
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com is where you can always send us

2791
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,000
emails. And the FUs of the week coming

2792
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
up as well as Twitter topics. Make sure you

2793
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
get those in because we will read Twitters

2794
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
while we're waiting for calls

2795
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
at Twitter.com slash

2796
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
O-L-R. So get those all in right now.

2797
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
Loki. Unfortunately,

2798
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
you know, when you're a game

2799
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
studio that produces

2800
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
all the Harry Potter games

2801
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
for the movies, and then the movie series ends,

2802
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
what's

2803
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
left for you than

2804
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
to just, you know, go under?

2805
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
I actually have an answer to that, but I'll let you

2806
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
finish the story. Yes.

2807
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
Apparently, the

2808
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
Bright Light Studios is now

2809
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
under a formal

2810
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
under the formal

2811
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
consultation process

2812
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
and they basically

2813
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
the employees that are impacted

2814
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
will be considered for other positions

2815
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
at other EA studios

2816
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
including those in the UK.

2817
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
The UK is a vital center for

2818
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
of game development

2819
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,000
for EA and we intend to maintain

2820
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,000
a strong presence there. And of course

2821
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
you know

2822
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
the last few games that they put out and kind of

2823
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
ehhh. But you know

2824
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
the movie tie-in games weren't really

2825
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,000
they don't have a high bar to hit

2826
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
but even then they missed those. So

2827
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
maybe it's

2828
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
for the best. I mean it sucks

2829
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,000
that people are out of work, but come on man

2830
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
maybe they'll reform

2831
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
with some better hands

2832
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
leading the brigade. You know sometimes

2833
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
sometimes that's the silver lining that comes out of

2834
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
these studio closures is that you know

2835
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
they'll reform with different

2836
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
direction and that could be a good thing.

2837
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
The one thing I do want to say about this though

2838
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
to answer the question, what could they be doing now?

2839
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
A Harry Potter MMO?

2840
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
Like. I would not want them

2841
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,000
doing that. Well yeah and maybe this is

2842
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
for the best. Like it sounds like based on

2843
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
the games that they've made and I've played some of these games

2844
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
they're not that great.

2845
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
They should

2846
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
put it in more capable hands if they're going to do a

2847
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000
Harry Potter MMO but seriously I'm not even

2848
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
that into the Harry Potter universe. I still haven't

2849
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
seen a single movie past the third movie

2850
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
and I really haven't read the books.

2851
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,000
I would

2852
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,000
try this game in a heartbeat because

2853
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,000
that universe would just be fun.

2854
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,000
It's meant for a video game. Another game

2855
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
that they created that

2856
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
also was terrible. Create.

2857
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000
What the hell is that? It was supposed

2858
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
to be a thing that was going to take on Little Big

2859
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
Planet. Came out last year. No one gave

2860
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
a shit about it. Was that the Xbox thing? It was

2861
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
Xbox, Playstation 3 and Wii.

2862
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,000
Terrible! What was

2863
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,000
Microsoft's answer to that? Didn't they have something?

2864
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,000
Oh that was also terrible. That ended up being an

2865
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,000
indie games thing didn't it?

2866
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
It was not Zubo.

2867
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
Was it Zubo? I don't remember. I don't know. They also did a game

2868
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,000
called Zubo on the DS but

2869
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,000
yeah I don't remember.

2870
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
The other thing I want to say about

2871
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
Harry Potter. Pottermore.

2872
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
There could be game material in there.

2873
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,000
I don't know. I just

2874
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,000
I don't know. I would really like to

2875
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,000
see an MMO come out of the Harry Potter universe

2876
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
but it does need to be done right. Don't

2877
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,000
do a shitty MMO or people are going to be upset.

2878
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,000
So.

2879
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
Alright. Anything else before I move on?

2880
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,000
Yeah but it's a tangent so I'm not going to go there

2881
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,000
right now. Alright why not? I'm going to start another story

2882
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
so go ahead. Go for the tangent. I forgot to mention

2883
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,000
since it wasn't really my gaming week

2884
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
and one of the reasons why I didn't play a lot of games

2885
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
this week because I was reading Ready Player

2886
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,000
One. It's fucking amazing.

2887
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,000
Oh yeah that was the book you were talking about last week.

2888
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,000
I'm serious. Any of our listeners

2889
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,000
for the show this book is for you. I mean

2890
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
it's absolutely without a doubt

2891
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,000
for you. Can I get it on Kindle?

2892
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,000
Yes. Maybe I'll check it out.

2893
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,000
Dude I mean

2894
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
not the spoil stuff but like

2895
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
be careful.

2896
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
Okay I'm going to spoil one thing but it is kind of cool.

2897
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
The very first challenge

2898
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
that this guy has to go through to get this

2899
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
because you have to find three keys and unlock

2900
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
the gates to find an easter egg

2901
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
that basically gets you the

2902
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,000
assets of this company. This guy

2903
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,000
is like a multi-billion dollar thing.

2904
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,000
So it's a little bit like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory

2905
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,000
with the treasure hunt and stuff like that.

2906
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,000
He has to fight a lich.

2907
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,000
Is it the lich king?

2908
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000
He has to joust the lich

2909
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,000
and the uh

2910
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,000
it's like I forget the dungeon

2911
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:01,000
it's some dungeon from Dungeons and Dragons.

2912
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,000
Is it the lich from Shadowgate?

2913
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,000
Not the lich from Shadowgate. But he has to fight him

2914
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,000
he has to joust him

2915
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,000
on the old arcade game

2916
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,000
joust.

2917
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,000
I knew something was coming with that.

2918
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
Seriously it's a fucking amazing

2919
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,000
book. You said this has been optioned for a movie right?

2920
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,000
It has been optioned for a movie.

2921
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
Warner Brother bought the rights last year.

2922
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000
I'm serious. Go check this book out

2923
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,000
now. It's great.

2924
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,000
Speaking of movies and all that stuff

2925
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,000
I have to get this out there.

2926
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
You know how like I talked a lot last week about the

2927
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,000
various shadow casting stuff that's going on in town

2928
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,000
you know I did Repo last week

2929
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,000
and there's Rocky Horror of course is the king

2930
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,000
of shadow cast movies and I think there's people

2931
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,000
that shadow cast other movies too. Do you know what

2932
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,000
shadow cast I believe

2933
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,000
I have heard rumblings of this and I think it was on a

2934
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,000
website somewhere and it was in the paper

2935
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,000
in an article on the group here that does

2936
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,000
a lot of shadow casts. Do you know what movie they're planning

2937
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,000
to shadow cast next year here in Sacramento?

2938
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:55,000
What? Scott Pilgrim vs. The World.

2939
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,000
Awesome!

2940
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,000
And now you know the movie

2941
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,000
when I first saw it was only kind of eh

2942
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:03,000
but thinking about seeing

2943
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:05,000
that movie in a group of very

2944
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,000
like minded individuals who are going to be there

2945
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
for the sheer cheese factor of it I actually think

2946
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,000
it's going to be pretty fucking awesome.

2947
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,000
So. But I'm serious.

2948
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,000
Go. I don't read books

2949
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,000
a lot. I mean hardly ever.

2950
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,000
And I couldn't put the book

2951
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:21,000
down. I had to read the whole thing straight through

2952
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,000
until I finished it. And it's just

2953
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:25,000
it's seriously

2954
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,000
if you're a fan of the 80's stuff, if you're a fan of

2955
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,000
classic video games, if you're a fan of

2956
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,000
just cool like kind of

2957
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,000
where's the internet going to go? That type

2958
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,000
of thing. And you got to read

2959
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,000
this. It's just amazing. Anyways.

2960
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,000
So that's my tangent there.

2961
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,000
Moving on to some other news.

2962
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:43,000
Oh let me play this way. No you're done.

2963
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:45,000
No no this is cool. The

2964
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,000
writer of this. He did a movie of

2965
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:49,000
Fanboys. He wrote the script and everything

2966
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:51,000
for that. Oh god I've heard about. Okay.

2967
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,000
I haven't seen that movie but I know what it is.

2968
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,000
The guy. He drives around

2969
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,000
in one of the cars

2970
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000
the avatar in this game

2971
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,000
or this universe drives

2972
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:03,000
around. It's not like a blue avatar.

2973
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,000
No like he hits this

2974
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,000
avatar in a virtual world type thing.

2975
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,000
He drives around or flies

2976
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,000
around I should say. And DeLorean

2977
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
that has

2978
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,000
something from Buckaroo Banzai where it allows

2979
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,000
them to travel through matter. Also

2980
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,000
has the Ecto-1

2981
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:21,000
logos and stuff on it. Also has a light

2982
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,000
bar from Knight Rider and Kittencider.

2983
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,000
And this guy fucking drives around in

2984
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,000
a goddamn DeLorean that has all that shit

2985
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,000
on it. Well obviously not the time traveling

2986
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,000
and the matter thing. But

2987
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,000
he drives around a fucking DeLorean

2988
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,000
with the kit and the light

2989
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:37,000
bar and everything.

2990
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,000
An actual car to all the book signings he goes to.

2991
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,000
It's amazing. ActDeft once again wants to know

2992
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,000
the name of the book. Ready Player One.

2993
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,000
Alright just for you Loki. I will

2994
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,000
try to get the author on the show. Why not?

2995
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,000
Sure it's

2996
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:51,000
amazing. It's a great book. Why not?

2997
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,000
Alright. Moving on

2998
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:55,000
I want to talk quickly

2999
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
about this. A video game

3000
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,000
soundtrack. But not your typical video game

3001
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,000
soundtrack. It's a video game soundtrack by

3002
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:03,000
the London Philharmonic Orchestra.

3003
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
So this is pretty cool.

3004
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:07,000
They're actually going to be putting out a

3005
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,000
CD called The Greatest

3006
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,000
Video Game Music. It will be

3007
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,000
21 tracks with music that

3008
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,000
encompasses like 30 years

3009
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,000
worth of games. Super Mario,

3010
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:19,000
Angry Birds, Metal Gear

3011
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,000
Solid Sons of Liberty, Fallout 3.

3012
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,000
Awesome. There's a

3013
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
sample available online. It's

3014
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,000
Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2

3015
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,000
theme. And they actually have a clip of it

3016
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,000
available on SoundCloud

3017
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,000
that you can check out under username

3018
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,000
kwahl. Let me play a quick little

3019
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,000
clip here of

3020
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,000
this. If I can kind of skip ahead in the song here a little bit.

3021
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,000
I can't change the volume on this but usually these

3022
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,000
classical songs are a little

3023
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
quieter anyway.

3024
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,000
You kind of get the feeling, right?

3025
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:55,000
Here we go.

3026
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
That's the London Philharmonic Orchestra doing that.

3027
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:05,000
So that's going to be awesome.

3028
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,000
Available wherever

3029
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
you buy CDs. You know, Amazon, iTunes

3030
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
what have you. Alright. Let's go

3031
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,000
to the mailbag. Every week you guys send us

3032
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:15,000
emails at mailbag at orangeloungelaunge

3033
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,000
radio.com

3034
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,000
Dark Soccer is going to read some of her favorites

3035
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,000
right now. Mailbag at orangeloungelaunge radio.

3036
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,000
All two of them. Two?

3037
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,000
Yep. First one comes... I'm firing the

3038
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,000
listeners. First one

3039
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,000
comes from Ian. Hey guys, long

3040
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,000
time listener, first time, I don't know, emailer

3041
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,000
whatever. I'm not sure if

3042
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,000
you guys knew about this or not but

3043
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:37,000
over the DSiWare store

3044
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,000
you can

3045
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,000
I guess you can get, the word get was left

3046
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:43,000
out. Legend of Zelda Four Swords Anniversary

3047
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:45,000
Edition for free. Hells yes.

3048
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,000
I'm not sure when it runs out but you better

3049
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,000
act fast. Actually, I have an answer for that.

3050
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,000
I was aware of that.

3051
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,000
It's pretty big news in the DS world if you're a

3052
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
3DS owner. And absolutely it's free.

3053
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,000
You literally have no

3054
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
reason not to get it. I haven't done it yet.

3055
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
Unless you don't have the 3DS.

3056
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,000
February is when it will not be

3057
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,000
free anymore. So it won't be free forever.

3058
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,000
I don't have a 3DS.

3059
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:09,000
The good news is those of you that get them at the holidays

3060
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,000
will, you know, which I imagine

3061
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
a lot of people are going to find 3DS's

3062
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,000
you know, under their Hanukkah tree or whatever it is

3063
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,000
they will

3064
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,000
you'll be able to still get it through February.

3065
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
Next email?

3066
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,000
Why not?

3067
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,000
Hello peoples.

3068
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,000
And this comes from Retertainment.

3069
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,000
There's a story that broke

3070
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,000
this week that just seemed to stick out my mind.

3071
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,000
Why men are in trouble.

3072
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,000
Okay, I'm going to click this.

3073
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,000
Men are always in trouble.

3074
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,000
Because we won't man up.

3075
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,000
The reason that this story sticks in my mind

3076
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:43,000
is because we pull out the popcorn too soon.

3077
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,000
I don't know about you, but

3078
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,000
I tend to tune out people who nag me to do things.

3079
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
It seems that no matter who it is

3080
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,000
or what it is about, whether they

3081
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,000
or it is substantial or not

3082
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,000
if you nag me, I tend not to pay attention.

3083
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,000
I tend not to pay attention

3084
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:01,000
to what you are currently saying

3085
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,000
or what you have said and will say in the future.

3086
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
So when William Bennett, President Obama

3087
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
or my mom tells me to get off the video games

3088
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
five hours a week, get yourself together

3089
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,000
get a challenging job, or get married

3090
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,000
I tend to put that in the bottom of my to-do list.

3091
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,000
Stay black, Retertainment. This message was crafted

3092
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,000
while watching a news podcast on my Apple TV.

3093
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,000
That's just called having a rebellious nature.

3094
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,000
You don't want to do

3095
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:23,000
what someone tells you to do. Someone says

3096
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:25,000
do it, you want to do something else.

3097
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,000
That's actually very common. A lot of people

3098
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,000
kind of have that rebellious nature.

3099
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,000
Right? Well, I'm just

3100
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,000
kind of glancing this over and...

3101
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:35,000
Is this an opinion piece?

3102
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,000
I noticed this on CNN. Yeah, I think it's an opinion piece.

3103
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,000
By a dude.

3104
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,000
It is. It's by a guy here.

3105
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,000
Eh. Don't care.

3106
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,000
Thank you. Thanks for your email.

3107
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,000
I was trying to read over your shoulder.

3108
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,000
Oh, you can get in the email and read it yourself.

3109
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:51,000
I'll read it and be more educated.

3110
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,000
Do I look like your correspondent?

3111
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,000
Now who's nagging?

3112
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,000
I'm not nagging.

3113
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,000
It's written by a guy who's literally from the middle ages.

3114
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,000
Oh, you read it?

3115
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,000
Yeah, he's like, he's super duper...

3116
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,000
Thank God someone's educated on this program.

3117
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,000
He's so fucking old and he just like

3118
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,000
he complains about all this stuff.

3119
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,000
Back in my day!

3120
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,000
No, I actually put a comment on my Facebook

3121
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:15,000
if you want to link the article. I'm like, yeah, this article

3122
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:17,000
is missing a lot of, back in my day

3123
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:19,000
and get off my lawn. I mean, because seriously

3124
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:21,000
that is what this is complaining about.

3125
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,000
They need a medal. Those people need

3126
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,000
to go to the military and fight for their

3127
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,000
country and blah, blah, blah. This is the

3128
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,000
problem with people. They sit at home and play

3129
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,000
their Xbox instead of getting a job.

3130
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,000
It's like, oh my

3131
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,000
God. I mean, seriously.

3132
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,000
Okay, well, how about this?

3133
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,000
Okay, I'm going to put it this way. This is a military angle.

3134
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,000
Now, would you go to work

3135
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
for a place that you knew was in

3136
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,000
debt and charging more debt?

3137
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
This

3138
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,000
is going to get political. I already know where you're going.

3139
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,000
But I'm just saying, would you?

3140
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,000
If they offered a great retirement plan, I might.

3141
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,000
Touché.

3142
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,000
Gotcha!

3143
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,000
However, if the company was in

3144
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,000
debt and started laying off people

3145
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:03,000
before you could retire.

3146
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:05,000
I think, logically,

3147
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,000
any profession you go into, you would think

3148
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:09,000
about the longevity of your job, absolutely.

3149
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,000
So then why would it be a good idea

3150
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,000
then to go into the military when

3151
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,000
the entire, the last

3152
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,000
couple of wars have been waged on

3153
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,000
a visa?

3154
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,000
He's

3155
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,000
one of the people that's wrong with the problem.

3156
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,000
He's probably one of the 1% too.

3157
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,000
I don't want to say anything negative about people

3158
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,000
that choose to go into the military because

3159
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,000
it's a thankless job that

3160
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,000
not everybody's brave enough to do.

3161
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000
No, that wasn't my point. I'm saying in response to this guy.

3162
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
What makes it attractive

3163
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,000
if, now I understand

3164
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,000
going in for patriotic, that's one thing.

3165
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,000
Or going in because, you know, it's a good option

3166
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,000
right now. It's kind of a good,

3167
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:47,000
to be fair, it's

3168
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,000
a really good substitute for

3169
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,000
school. I mean,

3170
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,000
I know that sounds like really fucked up, but like

3171
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
that real world experience, because people

3172
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,000
do a lot in the military. Well, I even

3173
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,000
considered going into the reserves

3174
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,000
for the Air Force.

3175
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000
But the whole, the whole

3176
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,000
thing is, is that he's bringing this up

3177
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,000
but what he's not looking at is that

3178
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,000
is there really going to be a future

3179
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,000
for more people involved if they can't afford

3180
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,000
to pay the people involved?

3181
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,000
If we're just charging up more debt.

3182
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:17,000
I think that this guy's one of the old schools

3183
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,000
who's part of the problem.

3184
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,000
You make it sound like though that we're paying back

3185
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,000
the debt.

3186
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,000
We can borrow as fucking much

3187
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:27,000
money as we want. That's the problem.

3188
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,000
That's the problem. They're not paying for

3189
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:31,000
the debt because we're not having a raise in taxes.

3190
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,000
We're not rationing,

3191
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,000
we're not doing any of the stuff that they've done in past wars.

3192
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,000
This world's going to hell in a

3193
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,000
handbasket. I bet you anything would have

3194
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,000
more jobs if there were, um,

3195
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
if we were actually working to fund this stuff ourselves,

3196
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,000
not outsourcing everything. Well,

3197
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,000
that's a whole nother Oprah. I wasn't literally

3198
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:49,000
saying though that he was telling people to go into the

3199
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:51,000
military. I was just saying that he's, you know,

3200
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,000
of the mind of like

3201
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,000
old, old, old people. I know that mindset

3202
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:57,000
though. Just like very stubborn.

3203
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,000
He thinks, oh, it's a new thing. Therefore,

3204
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,000
it's the cause of all problems. If it wasn't the comic books,

3205
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:03,000
the rock music, the

3206
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,000
drugs and more rock music,

3207
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
I mean, or maybe rap music.

3208
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
Um, yeah.

3209
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,000
Wasn't it, and I'm

3210
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
going to horribly misappropriate this

3211
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,000
quote and hopefully not disrespect

3212
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,000
somebody who recently deceased, but

3213
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:19,000
wasn't even Steve Jobs who said

3214
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:21,000
something about like drugs was

3215
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:23,000
one of something that really like

3216
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:25,000
the, like, like the one time he did it

3217
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,000
was kind of like a life changing thing.

3218
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,000
Not necessarily in like a negative way, but that

3219
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,000
it was something that

3220
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
I shouldn't have opened this box.

3221
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,000
I tell you what, we would be missing

3222
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,000
several classes. Not that I'm

3223
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:39,000
condoning drugs. I'm not condoning drugs.

3224
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,000
But I'm just saying, you know.

3225
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
Keep in mind, think of how many

3226
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,000
classic masterpieces would be missing if

3227
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,000
not for Ebsynth. Sometimes

3228
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:49,000
people who are a little rebellious

3229
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,000
cause us to think a little

3230
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,000
bit differently. I guess that's really my point.

3231
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,000
That's, that's exactly it.

3232
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,000
Think different, right? Touche.

3233
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,000
Except that's bad grammar, and I can't

3234
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:01,000
quote that. Shush. Alright.

3235
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,000
Moving on. Uh,

3236
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,000
that's it for the mailbag, huh? That's it. I said

3237
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
this too. I guess that, this would be a, well, I

3238
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,000
wasn't listening, because all I was hearing was

3239
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:11,000
nagging.

3240
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
Rob. Rob. Rob.

3241
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,000
What a good opportunity to go to the FUs

3242
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,000
of the week.

3243
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,000
What?

3244
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:49,000
And the whole market

3245
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,000
thing is really coming back

3246
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,000
to, it's really, and I told you

3247
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,000
guys before the show, but it's really

3248
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,000
playing a personal role in my life

3249
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,000
and it's

3250
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,000
ridiculous. And, uh,

3251
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,000
I really want to

3252
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,000
give a big FU to people

3253
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:07,000
who try to argue

3254
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,000
against

3255
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
something that they don't believe in

3256
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:13,000
by using, um,

3257
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:15,000
fallacious arguments.

3258
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,000
Like, number one. But using

3259
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:19,000
fallacious is okay. That's fine.

3260
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,000
But you know what I mean.

3261
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:23,000
Like, trying to discredit the person

3262
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:25,000
talking about something by saying that,

3263
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:27,000
you know, by trying to insult

3264
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:29,000
them, or by using

3265
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:31,000
you know, sensationalist

3266
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,000
words or trying to show that

3267
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:35,000
you know, an issue is

3268
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,000
skyrocketing, or throwing

3269
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,000
someone off the path to try

3270
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,000
to make themselves seem like they know what the hell they're talking

3271
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,000
about when they really don't.

3272
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,000
You know, if you don't know

3273
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,000
if you feel a certain way just

3274
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,000
because you feel that way

3275
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:51,000
or, you know, you have

3276
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:53,000
an opinion based on a feeling,

3277
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,000
just say that. But if you don't have facts to support

3278
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,000
it, don't inject your shit where

3279
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,000
you don't know what the fuck you're talking about.

3280
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:01,000
The end.

3281
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:03,000
Loki!

3282
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:05,000
Fuck you to, uh,

3283
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:07,000
being invited to

3284
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,000
the Saintsboro Hollywood

3285
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,000
pre-launch event the day before

3286
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:13,000
it happens, and yeah, it's

3287
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,000
just kind of hard to

3288
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,000
justify paying $400 for a

3289
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:19,000
goddamn ticket or driving, you know, a total

3290
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:21,000
of like 12 hours to and back

3291
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,000
from LA to go play Saintsboro

3292
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:25,000
for three hours. I would have been in the car.

3293
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:27,000
I don't know, Loki.

3294
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:29,000
Yeah, but see, I have a wife to contend with

3295
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:31,000
as well. Yeah, that's true, that's true. Um, but, you know,

3296
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:33,000
hey, if they were going to fly me down or something like that,

3297
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:35,000
that's cool. But see, here's the thing, it's like

3298
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:37,000
not that I would really want to rub elbows with

3299
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,000
you know, Lindsay Lohan or anything like that

3300
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:41,000
down there, but they had

3301
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,000
a bunch of people, you know,

3302
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:45,000
all the photos are people, you know,

3303
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,000
taking in the free alcohol and

3304
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,000
taking pictures and dancing and stuff like that, but no one

3305
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,000
fucking playing the goddamn game was like

3306
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,000
God damn it, they're playing the game!

3307
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:55,000
I was like

3308
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,000
all you people don't give a shit. Lindsay Lohan

3309
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,000
doesn't even fucking know what Saintsboro is.

3310
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:01,000
She was really there.

3311
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,000
Was that the one where they got the picture? Yes, it was the one

3312
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:05,000
right there. That is the one.

3313
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:07,000
That is the event that she was at.

3314
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:09,000
I don't know what the fuck Saintsboro is.

3315
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:11,000
They're paying her to be there. She's just like, somebody gives a shit

3316
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,000
about me? I'm so there.

3317
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:15,000
They had, what was it, they had one of the

3318
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:17,000
Kardashians or something there, but not

3319
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:19,000
any of the famous ones or something.

3320
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,000
I don't remember who it was, like Rob Kardashian

3321
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,000
or something. Isn't he the one

3322
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:25,000
that's on Dancing with the Stars? Yeah. Who was?

3323
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:27,000
I don't know who the fuck he is. But, uh,

3324
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,000
you know, it's just like all these people, like, I wouldn't

3325
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:31,000
know who the hell they are. And then they're like,

3326
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:33,000
so, but, my guy at KHQ

3327
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,000
is awesome though, for at least sending me the invite,

3328
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:37,000
you know, I was like, he's like, I just found out about this

3329
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:39,000
yesterday, and I'm like,

3330
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:41,000
yep, pretty much can't go there, so,

3331
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:43,000
well, but I keep

3332
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:45,000
tabs with them to see if there's something in San Francisco.

3333
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,000
I gotta say, I'm fortunate in that,

3334
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,000
you know, if something were to come up,

3335
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:51,000
like, let's say, BlizzCon's coming up

3336
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,000
this weekend, and like, if I could somehow swing it

3337
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,000
with my work, or even if I couldn't, like,

3338
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:57,000
if the event was on a Saturday, I'd be in the

3339
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:59,000
car Friday night. No, I

3340
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,000
would've- Allen would be like, can you take me with you?

3341
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,000
I, I seriously, well, the only

3342
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,000
reason I know is $400, because I looked at prices

3343
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,000
and tickets, and it just, it was not gonna happen

3344
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:09,000
even, even if I was able

3345
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,000
to pay for that, the flights just went-

3346
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:13,000
You got a family to think about now. And the flights just didn't

3347
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:15,000
jive, and you would've had to, I would've

3348
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:17,000
had to drive 12 hours for the playoff, 3 hours

3349
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:19,000
worth of a game is coming out in a few weeks, I mean,

3350
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,000
I would normally

3351
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:23,000
do that, if, you know, I had no restrictions,

3352
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:25,000
but, I, you know,

3353
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:27,000
I'm not, I don't make

3354
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,000
enough for $400, I can just

3355
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:31,000
blow away.

3356
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:33,000
Alright, fair enough. Um, my FU of the week,

3357
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:35,000
I, I don't have a lot of serious stuff.

3358
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:37,000
Things are going relatively well, all things considered.

3359
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,000
So, FU to, um,

3360
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:41,000
I would say FU to the traffic up in Apple

3361
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:43,000
Hill yesterday. Like,

3362
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:45,000
in the fact that all of the roads up there are only one lane

3363
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:47,000
with stop signs. I mean, I get that it's supposed to be

3364
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,000
all rural and country, but, there comes a

3365
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,000
point where you just admit you need to build

3366
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,000
a better off-ramp.

3367
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,000
That's it.

3368
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:57,000
Uh, moving on to a couple more

3369
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:59,000
news stories for you guys, and then, of course, Twitter

3370
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:01,000
topics in the Skype line very, very soon.

3371
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,000
Loki. Uh, this is kind of exciting.

3372
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:05,000
Not in the way you probably think, though.

3373
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:07,000
Um, Grand Theft Auto 3 is

3374
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:09,000
having its 10th anniversary.

3375
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:11,000
So, Rockstar is celebrating

3376
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:13,000
by porting it to the iOS

3377
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:15,000
platform. Uh, this would actually

3378
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:17,000
be the new iOS stuff.

3379
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,000
The iPad 2 and iPhone 4S

3380
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:21,000
are gonna be the only devices that are

3381
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:23,000
supporting it, at least on the Apple end. Android

3382
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:25,000
phones are also getting it, uh, Droid X2

3383
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:27,000
HTC Evo 2.

3384
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:29,000
LG Optimus 2X, uh,

3385
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,000
Motorola Atrix, and Samsung

3386
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,000
Galaxy S2, as well as

3387
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,000
Android tablets, Acer, uh, Icona,

3388
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:37,000
um, the Asus E Pad,

3389
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:39,000
Motorola XOOM, and Samsung Galaxy

3390
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,000
Tab 10.1.

3391
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:43,000
Um, so, that game's

3392
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:45,000
gonna be ported there in HD graphics

3393
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,000
and stuff like that, of course, you know, some

3394
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,000
unique gameplay stuff there, but,

3395
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:51,000
I don't know, I think it'd be pretty hard to play

3396
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:53,000
on a, uh, system. I'm just excited

3397
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:55,000
about the fact that they're doing that, cause that means

3398
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:57,000
that, you know,

3399
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:59,000
sooner or later this is coming to

3400
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:01,000
Xbox Live Arcade and Playstation Network, I mean,

3401
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:03,000
come on, they're putting in the work to do it now,

3402
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:05,000
they're gonna do it. And,

3403
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:07,000
once this comes, then Vice City and then

3404
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:09,000
San Andreas, and that's just gonna be amazing.

3405
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,000
Um, one other ridiculous

3406
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,000
thing though that they're having is they're having a 1-6

3407
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:15,000
scale, uh, action figure you can

3408
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,000
buy, uh, Claude

3409
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,000
from the, uh, hero, I guess

3410
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:21,000
of the first game, and of course,

3411
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:23,000
comes with outfits and guns and stuff like that,

3412
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:25,000
for a hundred and fucking fifty dollars.

3413
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:27,000
Not worth it, but, uh,

3414
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:29,000
if you're a really big fan, and I'm a huge

3415
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,000
fan of Grand Theft Auto, but I'm not paying

3416
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:33,000
a hundred and fifty dollars for a fucking toy.

3417
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:35,000
No.

3418
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:37,000
So.

3419
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:39,000
Oh well. It looks neat though.

3420
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,000
Uh, yeah.

3421
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:45,000
I, I guess, uh,

3422
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:47,000
any extra money they can get out of that

3423
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:49,000
franchise, they will, right?

3424
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:51,000
Uh, exactly. Um, I, I would

3425
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:53,000
be, I would love to play the game. Apparently

3426
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:55,000
though, they're gonna be porting the game later on to

3427
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:57,000
other, um, platforms, you know, like the

3428
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,000
just the regular iPhone 4 and stuff like that,

3429
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:01,000
but it's not gonna be as pretty.

3430
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:03,000
Um,

3431
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:05,000
and it, I do think that, uh, it does

3432
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:07,000
support some of the blue, uh,

3433
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:09,000
maybe some of the Bluetooth controllers and stuff like that,

3434
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,000
so that'd be kinda cool to actually play with buttons, but

3435
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:13,000
I really just want it to come to

3436
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:15,000
Xbox Live Arcade. Really, I would just say

3437
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,000
skip 3 and Vice City, just,

3438
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:19,000
just bring San Andreas. San Andreas

3439
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:21,000
multiplayer, you don't even need to put out a grand theft of

3440
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:23,000
five anytime soon. People would eat

3441
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,000
that up. Alright.

3442
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:27,000
Uh, moving on to Apple

3443
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:29,000
related news, other iOS news,

3444
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:31,000
uh, this has to do with Game Center,

3445
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:33,000
which got some minor upgrades in the whole

3446
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:35,000
iOS 5 thing, uh, but nothing

3447
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:37,000
really to scream about. I mean, yay, it

3448
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:39,000
shows you your total achievement points now in comparison

3449
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:41,000
to others, and you can have your own little

3450
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:43,000
picture. Whoopee. But

3451
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:45,000
you gotta wonder if maybe there was other

3452
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:47,000
stuff that was supposed to come, because some patents

3453
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:49,000
that Apple had filed, uh, was talking about

3454
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:51,000
avatars, uh, little avatars

3455
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:53,000
on Game Centers, you know, where you could, like, have little hats

3456
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:55,000
and hair, pretty much the exact same thing,

3457
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:57,000
you know, with the, uh, Xbox avatars, and the,

3458
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:59,000
the me's on the Wii.

3459
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:01,000
Uh, that is apparently something that Apple

3460
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:03,000
was, or is looking at

3461
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:05,000
for Game Center. Uh, the patents were originally

3462
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:07,000
filed in April,

3463
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:09,000
but obviously we didn't see this in

3464
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:11,000
iOS 5, so either it was scrapped, or

3465
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:13,000
who knows. Uh... You know what those remind me of?

3466
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:15,000
They remind me of the little figures,

3467
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:17,000
or the characters from, uh, Tiny Tower.

3468
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:19,000
Oh, kinda,

3469
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:21,000
yeah, cause Tiny Tower kinda has that thing going on

3470
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,000
with it, but, um, I, I gotta say

3471
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:25,000
honestly, this is just, okay,

3472
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:27,000
it's just another version of the me, you know,

3473
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:29,000
avatar somewhere else, woohoo.

3474
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:31,000
So, whatever. Game Center's

3475
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:33,000
kind of, uh, I don't know, there's

3476
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:35,000
just not, not a lot to get excited about

3477
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:37,000
with Game Center. I mean, I get that Apple's

3478
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:39,000
kinda trying to, like, like, standardize

3479
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:41,000
things, but you look at what's going on with things

3480
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:43,000
like Open Feint, and you're kinda like, wow,

3481
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:45,000
there's, they seem to be pushing the envelope a lot

3482
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:47,000
faster, and doing other, you know,

3483
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:49,000
exciting things with it, but the problem with Open Feint

3484
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:51,000
is that, because it's not

3485
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:53,000
tied into the iOS, it kinda

3486
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:55,000
sometimes can get in the way, and is distracting,

3487
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:57,000
and a lot of games really push it, when you're like,

3488
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:59,000
you know what, I'm just, I'm not interested in all that.

3489
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:01,000
So, I don't know.

3490
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:03,000
This is something I've noticed amongst my iOS gaming.

3491
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:05,000
Alright,

3492
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,000
DarkSakura, what do you got for us?

3493
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:09,000
We have a few things, well,

3494
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:11,000
really just one thing, but it has to do with, uh,

3495
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:13,000
Eve Online. There is, um,

3496
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:15,000
an offer going out

3497
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:17,000
for lapsed Eve Online

3498
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:19,000
users to save money.

3499
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:21,000
So basically, if they reactivate

3500
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:23,000
their account, um,

3501
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:25,000
they pay $4.95 for 30 days

3502
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:27,000
instead of $14.95.

3503
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:29,000
So, I guess

3504
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:31,000
it's just to get people back in for

3505
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:33,000
that month and see if it keeps them hooked.

3506
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:37,000
It's very interesting.

3507
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:39,000
Well, I'm sure when

3508
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:41,000
there's all these other MMOs going on,

3509
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:43,000
you know, and of course, launches coming up

3510
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:45,000
like Star Wars and so forth,

3511
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:47,000
you know, these aging

3512
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:49,000
MMOs have to do everything they can to kind of get

3513
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:51,000
people to look at it again,

3514
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:53,000
you know. Yeah. But of course, Eve has

3515
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:55,000
that whole spin-off coming to the PlayStation 3

3516
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:57,000
they were talking about at E3. That's true.

3517
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:59,000
So, that is right there. It's probably gonna get

3518
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:01,000
a lot of people kind of looking back at Eve, I'm sure.

3519
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:03,000
Possibly.

3520
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:05,000
So, Sony is apparently looking for,

3521
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:07,000
um, or possibly

3522
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:09,000
mulling around, if you will,

3523
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:11,000
an idea where people

3524
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:13,000
can actually

3525
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:15,000
get a discount on purchasing

3526
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:17,000
UMD games

3527
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:19,000
on the Vita

3528
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:21,000
if you currently own the actual

3529
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:23,000
UMD game.

3530
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:25,000
This is coming from the Japanese language fact

3531
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:27,000
that's posted, I guess,

3532
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:29,000
on Sony's PlayStation website.

3533
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:31,000
They're saying that the fact

3534
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:33,000
notes that they're considering a service to offer

3535
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:35,000
PSN versions of UMD games

3536
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:37,000
users

3537
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:39,000
own for a special price. This is in

3538
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:41,000
the confirmation, obviously, but

3539
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:43,000
it's something that they're considering details

3540
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:45,000
of the service will be announced later.

3541
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:47,000
I don't know how the hell they're gonna be able to do that, but

3542
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:49,000
maybe you have to pop it in your

3543
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:51,000
PSP and it

3544
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:53,000
recognizes it's there or something like that.

3545
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:55,000
I don't know how that really

3546
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:57,000
works, but, uh,

3547
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:59,000
yeah. It says, I guess,

3548
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:01,000
also it says that the Vita will

3549
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:03,000
play all downloadable PSP games

3550
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:05,000
except for game

3551
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:07,000
archives, which I guess

3552
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:09,000
is, um, the

3553
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:11,000
Japanese label for the PlayStation

3554
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:13,000
1 classics, Neo Geo games,

3555
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:15,000
and retro downloads.

3556
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:17,000
So, you're not gonna be able to

3557
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:19,000
play your PlayStation 1 games, I guess.

3558
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:21,000
But maybe they're gonna have a

3559
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:23,000
different way to play them later on or something.

3560
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:27,000
Oh well. That's too bad.

3561
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:29,000
Uh, not surprising,

3562
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:31,000
though. Well, it's hard to

3563
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:33,000
port out the backwards, you know.

3564
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:35,000
It's akin to the whole PlayStation 2 games that are now

3565
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:37,000
showing up on PlayStation 3. You know, I don't know.

3566
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:39,000
It's kinda what it reminds me of.

3567
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:41,000
Alright, one more story for you guys.

3568
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:43,000
Then we're gonna open up the Skype line at

3569
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:45,000
1877 Game OLR or a username on Skype,

3570
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:47,000
Orange Lounge Radio, and this has to do with

3571
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:49,000
the game in the world of South

3572
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:51,000
Park. You know, South Park gets these games

3573
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:53,000
once in a while. In fact, they had an Xbox Live arcade

3574
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:55,000
game. It was the Tower Defense game, and I

3575
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:57,000
can't remember the name of it. Let's Go Tower Defense

3576
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:59,000
Play. That was it. Uh, that was out,

3577
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:01,000
what, about two years ago? Well, a

3578
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:03,000
new South Park game was announced for Xbox

3579
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:05,000
Live Arcade. It's supposed to be coming out next spring.

3580
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:07,000
It's called South Park, Tenorman's

3581
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:09,000
Revenge. Do you remember

3582
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:11,000
Scott Tenorman? That was the character

3583
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:13,000
where his parents were chopped up, and

3584
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:15,000
Cartman fed the parents

3585
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:17,000
in the chili to Scott Tenorman. That was one of

3586
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:19,000
the most fucked up episodes of

3587
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:21,000
South Park that there was. What was the play on

3588
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:23,000
Titus, right? One of

3589
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:25,000
those movies that had come out around

3590
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:27,000
the same time, and it was

3591
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:29,000
one of those so sick

3592
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:31,000
it was funny. Yeah.

3593
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:33,000
Anyhow,

3594
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:35,000
I guess it was being shown

3595
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:37,000
at Comic Con, and some

3596
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:39,000
screenshots have come out of it.

3597
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:41,000
It looks like it might be a little more of a platformer.

3598
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:43,000
They have a trailer for it. It's actually

3599
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:45,000
pretty cool looking. And ManBearPig is in it.

3600
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:47,000
Oh, is there a trailer? There is a trailer for it.

3601
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:49,000
Let me find it.

3602
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:51,000
It was pretty

3603
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:53,000
cool looking. It looks like a

3604
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:55,000
four player side-scroller

3605
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:57,000
game. Okay, here we go.

3606
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:59,000
Got a trailer here. Let's take a look.

3607
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:09,000
Is he building a robot? Oh, I see.

3608
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:23,000
Begin ginger vacation.

3609
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:25,000
Nice.

3610
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:33,000
There's some gameplay.

3611
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:35,000
It looks like it might be four player simultaneous.

3612
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:37,000
Yeah. It's kind of what it looks like.

3613
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:39,000
You can play as the goon.

3614
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:43,000
That might be cute. A lot of those

3615
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:45,000
South Park games are kind of dopey.

3616
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:47,000
God, there was one that was especially

3617
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:49,000
terrible. What was it on? I want to

3618
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:51,000
say it was on the Nintendo 64.

3619
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:53,000
It was some South Park kart racing game.

3620
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:55,000
Not even that. That was pretty bad too.

3621
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:57,000
There was like a first person shooter game.

3622
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:59,000
It wasn't a kart racing game. It was a first person shooter.

3623
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:01,000
It was really, it was a special kind of terrible.

3624
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:03,000
Like, it was

3625
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:05,000
really bad.

3626
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:07,000
So yeah, hopefully it's better than that.

3627
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:09,000
Alright.

3628
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:11,000
Oh, even TigerClaw in our chatroom at chat.ornsauceready.com

3629
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:13,000
just brought that game up.

3630
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:15,000
The N64 game and Rama's like, I remember that.

3631
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:17,000
Yeah, I'd like to forget that that ever happened.

3632
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:19,000
Thanks.

3633
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:21,000
Alright, Skype line is open. 1-877-GAME-OLR

3634
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:23,000
or our username on Skype is

3635
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:25,000
OrangeLoungeRadio if you want to give us a call.

3636
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:27,000
Talk about anything that we've talked about tonight

3637
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:29,000
so far on the show or maybe something that we

3638
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:31,000
missed that you were hoping we would talk about.

3639
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:33,000
I don't know. Meanwhile, going to

3640
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:35,000
some Twitter topics.

3641
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:37,000
Which I'm signed into the wrong account.

3642
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:39,000
I was about to read tweets that were sent to me.

3643
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:41,000
Not to the show.

3644
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:43,000
Oh Rob, you're being a diva.

3645
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:45,000
Are you reading my mother's Twitter?

3646
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:49,000
No.

3647
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:51,000
Alright.

3648
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:53,000
Going to some tweets. We have a couple tweets here

3649
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:55,000
from TigerClaw305. He always likes to

3650
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:57,000
tweet us some stories that

3651
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:59,000
otherwise might slip through the cracks.

3652
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:01,000
The first one that he tweeted us is about a

3653
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:03,000
Spider-Man video game. The Amazing Spider-Man

3654
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:05,000
video game coming in 2012.

3655
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:07,000
It's supposed to be open world.

3656
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:09,000
And I guess there's teaser posters all over New York Comic-Con

3657
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:11,000
about it. Obviously the new movie

3658
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:13,000
because they're rebooting the franchise

3659
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:15,000
that wasn't that dead. But whatever.

3660
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:17,000
They're rebooting it in 2012.

3661
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:19,000
So that's on it's way. They also have a trailer for that too.

3662
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:21,000
Is there really? Let me see if we can

3663
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:23,000
find. Well, hold on. Because we're getting a call.

3664
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:25,000
I'll look for a trailer for this

3665
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:27,000
while we take our call. But we do have

3666
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:29,000
a call coming in. So let's go do it. Hi, you're on

3667
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:31,000
Orange Launch Radio. Who's this? Hey, it's DJ

3668
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:33,000
Ron Mess from Anime Jam Session. How are you

3669
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:35,000
guys doing tonight? I am Fantastic Rama.

3670
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:37,000
How are you doing?

3671
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:39,000
I am tired. I am sitting

3672
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:41,000
here pouring over photos,

3673
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:43,000
pouring over videos, and sipping

3674
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:45,000
my spiked apple juice.

3675
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:47,000
Now you were at New York Comic-Con

3676
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:49,000
this weekend, right? Yes, I was.

3677
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:51,000
All four days. And are you working on your Fernando

3678
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:53,000
cosplay?

3679
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:55,000
No. And screw you

3680
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:57,000
Loki. No. No.

3681
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:59,000
No. No.

3682
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:01,000
Alright. You know we

3683
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:03,000
just gotta give you a hard time.

3684
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:05,000
Besides, I have a Buddha belly so that ain't

3685
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:07,000
happening anytime soon. Alright.

3686
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:09,000
Well, how was the con? Tell us about

3687
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:11,000
it. Okay, first, I gotta ask. Did you play

3688
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:13,000
Bungee Ferret Tossing? Yes.

3689
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:15,000
Yes, I did. And, um, we do

3690
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:17,000
have a demo video

3691
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:19,000
up. Woohoo!

3692
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:21,000
And I just posted it in the chat

3693
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:23,000
room. Was this blessed by YYR?

3694
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:25,000
Yes. Yes, it was.

3695
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:27,000
Okay, just making sure. Alright. Plus, I am

3696
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:29,000
also press so, you know.

3697
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:31,000
Oh, I see. Oh, you're a press.

3698
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:33,000
Oh yeah, because you're Anime Jam Session.

3699
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:35,000
Alright, let's see what this is.

3700
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:37,000
Action.

3701
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:39,000
Okay, first off, you wanna cut out

3702
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:41,000
the guy that says action. You do know that, right?

3703
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:43,000
You do realize I'm up

3704
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:45,000
here rushing trying to get the video

3705
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:47,000
online. Alright, alright,

3706
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:49,000
alright. I love the poster in the background

3707
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:51,000
too. How long is your snake?

3708
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:53,000
That's also, he also

3709
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:55,000
has it as a shirt. Clever.

3710
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:57,000
Clever. We're going to check

3711
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:59,000
out OLR's exclusive game

3712
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:01,000
Bungee Ferret Tossing.

3713
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:03,000
Were

3714
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:05,000
you playing this in a hardboat?

3715
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:07,000
Oh, we're watching it.

3716
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:13,000
And so you're

3717
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:15,000
kind of moving around on the helicopter. It doesn't look like

3718
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:17,000
things are going too crazy on the ground right now.

3719
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:19,000
Oh, there are the ferrets.

3720
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:21,000
It's kind of interesting

3721
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:23,000
this strikes me as like a

3722
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:25,000
mix between like a twin stick shooter

3723
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:27,000
like Geometry Wars where you're trying to dodge

3724
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:29,000
all the bullets. But yet

3725
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:31,000
it's a whole different

3726
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:33,000
element. Like you don't shoot the same way.

3727
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:35,000
It's like this mixture of

3728
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:37,000
defender and Geometry Wars.

3729
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:43,000
We can't fix the chopper in battle

3730
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:45,000
so be careful. Now the blood

3731
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:47,000
splats aren't really coming through very well on this

3732
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:49,000
video but still.

3733
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:53,000
Nice. Triple.

3734
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:57,000
Very cool. Tell us

3735
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:59,000
a little more. You can see the ground is all bloody. That's awesome.

3736
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:01,000
Tell us a little more while we

3737
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:03,000
watch the rest of this game play

3738
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:05,000
video here.

3739
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:07,000
I have to say that is one of the most bloodiest

3740
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:09,000
8-bit style video games I

3741
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:11,000
have played in a very long

3742
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:13,000
time. Which is a good thing. If it has our

3743
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:15,000
name on it, it better.

3744
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:19,000
Awesome.

3745
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:21,000
What else did you see in New York Comic Con?

3746
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:23,000
Some other stuff but before I continue

3747
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:25,000
if you notice

3748
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:27,000
the ferret that

3749
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:29,000
Fernando is tossing looks familiar

3750
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:31,000
if you follow Naruto.

3751
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:33,000
Really? Oh is it?

3752
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:35,000
That is hers isn't it?

3753
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:37,000
Yes it is. Awesome.

3754
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:39,000
Well of course

3755
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:41,000
it's a video game.

3756
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:43,000
There's got to be a Naruto reference in it at someplace.

3757
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:45,000
But there's a kill counter.

3758
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:47,000
You killed

3759
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:49,000
21 terrorists. Oh 22.

3760
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:51,000
Nice.

3761
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:53,000
And a few ninjas. What else did you

3762
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:55,000
see at the con over 4 days?

3763
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:57,000
Final Fantasy 13 2.

3764
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:59,000
Oh nice. How was that?

3765
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:01,000
You can jump in this game.

3766
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:03,000
It's about freaking

3767
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:05,000
time.

3768
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:07,000
I thought Square Enix didn't know how

3769
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:09,000
to handle jumping.

3770
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:11,000
I played the

3771
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:13,000
demo. It was pretty fun

3772
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:15,000
and I hate to say it

3773
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:17,000
I am not saying this as a

3774
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:19,000
360 fanboy. But they did

3775
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:21,000
have the 360 and the

3776
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:23,000
PS3 versions both sitting

3777
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:25,000
on display. Same model

3778
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:27,000
TVs. And looks like

3779
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:29,000
the graphics in the 360 version

3780
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:31,000
looks a little bit sharper. A little bit crisper.

3781
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:33,000
Interesting. Because usually

3782
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:35,000
you would think with the whole Blu-ray stuff that it

3783
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:37,000
would look a little better on the Playstation 3.

3784
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:39,000
Pretty much. And I was kind of shocked

3785
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:41,000
by that. Very interesting.

3786
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:43,000
What else?

3787
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:45,000
Any other games that you got your hands on while you were

3788
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:47,000
out there? Like maybe Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom

3789
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:49,000
or whatever else they were showing there?

3790
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:51,000
I could not get on the line for that.

3791
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:53,000
And one of my staffers who was covering

3792
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:55,000
games, he got sick over the weekend

3793
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:57,000
so he could not finish up all the game coverage.

3794
02:08:57,000 --> 02:08:59,000
Oh no.

3795
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:01,000
But here's something interesting.

3796
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:03,000
Now, I've

3797
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:05,000
ran into some friends of mine and they're

3798
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:07,000
all dressed as characters from

3799
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:09,000
Mega Man Legends. Right. Oh boy.

3800
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:11,000
They actually went to the Capcom

3801
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:13,000
booth and protested them

3802
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:15,000
canceling Mega Man Legends 3.

3803
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:17,000
They should have

3804
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:19,000
occupied Capcom. Yeah, occupied

3805
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:21,000
Capcom. Is that what was going

3806
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:23,000
on? One of them

3807
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:25,000
actually had a sign. I might have taken a picture

3808
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:27,000
of it. Occupied Capcom. Nice.

3809
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:29,000
We are the 99%

3810
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:31,000
of gamers that want a new Mega Man game.

3811
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:33,000
Nice.

3812
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:35,000
And they're all walking around

3813
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:37,000
the convention center trying to

3814
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:39,000
get people to follow

3815
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:41,000
with them. And I saw one of them

3816
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:43,000
and I said, you do realize

3817
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:45,000
it's not going to happen, right?

3818
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:47,000
And they're like, you shut up, it'll

3819
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:49,000
happen! And I'm like, sure it will.

3820
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:51,000
Sure it will.

3821
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:53,000
It's going to be a lot harder once

3822
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:55,000
certain individuals have left

3823
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:57,000
Capcom, but okay, okay.

3824
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:59,000
Yeah, pretty much. Nice.

3825
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:01,000
But they didn't get thrown out of the booth?

3826
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:03,000
No, not at all. That's good.

3827
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:05,000
I was thinking maybe there was going to be some drama,

3828
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:07,000
some throw down, some cops called.

3829
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:09,000
No, no, no.

3830
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:11,000
We were too far away

3831
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:13,000
from that. I see, I see.

3832
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:15,000
Alright.

3833
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:17,000
Well, I don't know what else to ask you about the con.

3834
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:19,000
Anything else you want to share with us tonight?

3835
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:21,000
Uh, let's see.

3836
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:23,000
Well,

3837
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:25,000
I would say

3838
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:27,000
cosplays. The most popular

3839
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:29,000
gaming cosplay I saw this weekend

3840
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:31,000
was pretty much

3841
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:33,000
Link, Mario,

3842
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:35,000
and Peach.

3843
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:37,000
So just kind of your traditional Nintendo

3844
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:39,000
characters. Very traditional.

3845
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:41,000
Yeah.

3846
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:43,000
Also, there's this one guy, he cosplays

3847
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:45,000
the red trainer from

3848
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:47,000
Pokemon. He actually was walking

3849
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:49,000
around the convention center with his

3850
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:51,000
bike playing the Pokemon theme

3851
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:53,000
as you're walking through as you're playing the game.

3852
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:55,000
That background music. Oh my god.

3853
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:57,000
Nice. I thought that was pretty

3854
02:10:57,000 --> 02:10:59,000
cool. Sounds pretty intricate to me.

3855
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:01,000
Eh, he's one step

3856
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:03,000
up. I would be too lazy to do something

3857
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:05,000
like that.

3858
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:07,000
At least you're honest.

3859
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:09,000
Pretty much. Alright my friend, well do you have anything else

3860
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:11,000
you want to share with us tonight before I let you go?

3861
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:13,000
Uh, not now,

3862
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:15,000
but I think I'm waiting

3863
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:17,000
on a response from somebody

3864
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:19,000
to hear some other interesting information. As soon as I hear it,

3865
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:21,000
you'll be the first to know. Alright.

3866
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:23,000
Hmm. Interesting. Alright. Keep me posted.

3867
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:25,000
Will do. Alright. Later buddy.

3868
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:27,000
You got it bro.

3869
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:29,000
1877 Game OLR. Our username

3870
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:31,000
on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio if you

3871
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:33,000
want to give us a call. I'm very appreciative of

3872
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:35,000
the video of Bungee Ferret Tossing since we weren't

3873
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:37,000
there to play it. I'm excited that

3874
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:39,000
it's only going to be a dollar.

3875
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:41,000
That's a bargain price for a game.

3876
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:43,000
I love that YYR is doing that.

3877
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:45,000
Really is a labor of love for the craft

3878
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:47,000
of creating games. That's awesome.

3879
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:49,000
Back to the Twitter at Twitter.com

3880
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:51,000
slash OLR. Another tweet

3881
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:53,000
coming to us from Tigerclaw

3882
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:55,000
who links us to this article on

3883
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:57,000
Gamasutra

3884
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:59,000
about a mobile game

3885
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:01,000
that promotes social network safety

3886
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:03,000
for children. I thought we had something similar

3887
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:05,000
to this last week, but I don't think it's quite the same thing.

3888
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:07,000
Because I think this one is now an iOS

3889
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:09,000
game that's coming out and it's

3890
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:11,000
about Be Seen, which is like a

3891
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:13,000
network. And I guess it's like telling people

3892
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:15,000
not to share all their personal

3893
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:17,000
shit online.

3894
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:19,000
You know what I mean?

3895
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:21,000
You know, because some kids don't really know better.

3896
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:23,000
Right? So

3897
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:25,000
you got to teach them how to handle

3898
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:27,000
social networking appropriately.

3899
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:29,000
So.

3900
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:31,000
Alright. Let's go to another call.

3901
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:33,000
We're getting more calls on the line here, so we'll go to another one.

3902
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:35,000
Hi, you're on Orange Challenge Radio. Who's this?

3903
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:37,000
Hey, it's CD Thunder. Hey, CD Thunder.

3904
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:39,000
What's on your mind, buddy?

3905
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:41,000
Not much. I have a couple of things I'd like to talk about.

3906
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:43,000
Alright. What's up?

3907
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:45,000
Well, I went to the

3908
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:47,000
mall today and there's an arcade

3909
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:49,000
game that I just couldn't stop playing. I was like,

3910
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:51,000
oh, man, this is so good.

3911
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:53,000
I got to keep playing. You know what I mean?

3912
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:55,000
Yeah, of course. What game is that?

3913
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:57,000
I'm not sure if you've heard of it. It's called Paradise

3914
02:12:57,000 --> 02:12:59,000
Lost.

3915
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:01,000
I don't think I have heard of that. Tell me the

3916
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:03,000
set up for this.

3917
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:05,000
It's basically you're

3918
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:07,000
the survivor on an island

3919
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:09,000
and you go from gun to gun

3920
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:11,000
and just mowing down all these guys.

3921
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:13,000
That's

3922
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:15,000
all you pretty much do. And then you

3923
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:17,000
get these different bosses, like helicopters

3924
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:19,000
and stuff.

3925
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:21,000
So it's

3926
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:23,000
pretty basic. But there's one

3927
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:25,000
boss that's called the Chucker and it's this

3928
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:27,000
mutant looking thing that

3929
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:29,000
just throws

3930
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:31,000
exploding barrels at you. I'm finding

3931
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:33,000
that this is apparently Paradise Lost

3932
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:35,000
is a arcade version

3933
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:37,000
of the series Far Cry

3934
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:39,000
and specifically Far Cry Instincts.

3935
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:41,000
So now the way you're describing the game kind of

3936
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:43,000
makes a lot of sense. So this is some type

3937
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:45,000
of like port to it, I guess.

3938
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:47,000
It's a rail shooter arcade game port

3939
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:49,000
of Far Cry Instincts and

3940
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:51,000
it was made in 2007

3941
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:53,000
and I guess it uses hardware very similar

3942
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:55,000
to Aliens Extermination. So

3943
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:57,000
kind of neat.

3944
02:13:57,000 --> 02:13:59,000
Well, it would be kind of cool if

3945
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:01,000
they actually put Paradise Lost on the Wii

3946
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:03,000
or some other system because

3947
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:05,000
it's just a lot of fun.

3948
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:07,000
It's very addicting. Well, just so you know,

3949
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:09,000
if you do really like the game, you might want to check out the

3950
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:11,000
Far Cry series. Far Cry Instincts was on

3951
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:13,000
the original Xbox, not the 360

3952
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:15,000
but the old, old Xbox.

3953
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:17,000
It was actually made in like 2005.

3954
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:19,000
So if you like those type of games, you know, you

3955
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:21,000
like that, you might enjoy the Far Cry series

3956
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:23,000
which, you know, they're still making

3957
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:25,000
those games. Like Far Cry 3 is

3958
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:27,000
coming out

3959
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:29,000
next year. I don't think it's out

3960
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:31,000
yet. No, it's definitely not out yet but it's coming

3961
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:33,000
out soon. Wasn't that the one they were showing the

3962
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:35,000
big trailer for and it was like really

3963
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:37,000
creepster looking. They kicked the guy down the

3964
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:39,000
cave. Was that Far Cry? Or am I mixing it up

3965
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:41,000
with another series? I think it was.

3966
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:43,000
I think it was.

3967
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:45,000
I don't know off hand. Anyway, sorry

3968
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:47,000
CD Thunder, don't mean to digress. What else did you

3969
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:49,000
check out?

3970
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:51,000
That was the only arcade game that

3971
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:53,000
I want to talk about but

3972
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:55,000
the next thing I'd like to discuss is what

3973
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:57,000
I think would make a really good game.

3974
02:14:57,000 --> 02:14:59,000
Alrighty.

3975
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:01,000
I'm not sure if you agree with me on this but

3976
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:03,000
what if somebody combined House of the

3977
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:05,000
Dead and CarnEvil and put, and made

3978
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:07,000
them, made it just one game.

3979
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:09,000
That would already be House of the

3980
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:11,000
Dead. House of the Dead.

3981
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:13,000
How so Dark Sakura? Because it's kind

3982
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:15,000
of like the shooter and everything.

3983
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:17,000
Or maybe I'm picturing in what

3984
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:19,000
CD Thunder is describing like an

3985
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:21,000
evil carnival maybe. Like a

3986
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:23,000
possessed, I guess that is carnival

3987
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:25,000
isn't it?

3988
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:27,000
Well the thing is

3989
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:29,000
I think carnival just needs more zombies.

3990
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:31,000
The thing is

3991
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:33,000
you go through the House of the Dead

3992
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:35,000
and along the way you find this girl

3993
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:37,000
and

3994
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:39,000
you rescue her and she'd be

3995
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:41,000
tag along with you throughout the

3996
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:43,000
entire rest

3997
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:45,000
of the game and then you think you're done

3998
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:47,000
and then one of the evil

3999
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:49,000
characters from the CarnEvil

4000
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:51,000
game comes out and

4001
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:53,000
kidnaps her and then you have to go

4002
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:55,000
in there and rescue her.

4003
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:57,000
So it'd be one long game instead of just

4004
02:15:57,000 --> 02:15:59,000
two separate ones. Well you should

4005
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:01,000
tweet the idea to Sega because

4006
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:03,000
anything is possible through Twitter. That's something we've

4007
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:05,000
learned very recently.

4008
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:07,000
Alright.

4009
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:09,000
Well, CD Thunder buddy I'm gonna let you

4010
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:11,000
go so we can get more calls. Do you have any final thoughts?

4011
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:15,000
Um

4012
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:17,000
Is it, can I plug something?

4013
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:19,000
Okay.

4014
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:21,000
It's another gaming

4015
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:23,000
podcast. It's called 4 Player Podcast.

4016
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:25,000
It's really

4017
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:27,000
good, not that I'm saying that

4018
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:29,000
I'm not saying that this one isn't really good

4019
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:31,000
but it's another really good one.

4020
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:33,000
No, I'm familiar with

4021
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:35,000
that show. It is a fine show

4022
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:37,000
and I think some of their folks follow me

4023
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:39,000
on Twitter and vice versa so

4024
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:41,000
they do a lot with the Justin TV

4025
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:43,000
integration which is something

4026
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:45,000
we kinda used to do but our radio

4027
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:47,000
show is not that exciting to watch

4028
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:49,000
so getting a webcam back here hasn't exactly

4029
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:51,000
been a high priority for us but they're a little

4030
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:53,000
better at integrating all the video, the actual

4031
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:55,000
gameplay and all of that so

4032
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:57,000
Well if you had a webcam everybody could see

4033
02:16:57,000 --> 02:16:59,000
Shermie.

4034
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:01,000
Maybe we just need a Shermie cam. We'll put

4035
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:03,000
a camera under the table and you can see

4036
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:05,000
my feet and Shermie. We'll think about that.

4037
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:07,000
That's a good suggestion. Alright, later buddy.

4038
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:09,000
Bye. Bye.

4039
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:11,000
1877 game OLR or a username

4040
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:13,000
on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio if you

4041
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:15,000
wanna give us a call and

4042
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:17,000
I think we're out of tweets.

4043
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:19,000
Not a lot of people tweeting us this week.

4044
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:21,000
Although I will say this. This actually came in earlier

4045
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:23,000
in the week. Zushi13

4046
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:25,000
had tweeted us saying, I got to play some bungee

4047
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:27,000
ferret toss. It's a really fun game.

4048
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:29,000
Oh,

4049
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:31,000
13forever tweeted us

4050
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:33,000
saying, Sweet! Scribblenuts for iOS

4051
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:35,000
Scribblenuts. Scribblenuts

4052
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:37,000
for iOS is real and ready

4053
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:39,000
for install and tweets us that yeah

4054
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:41,000
Scribblenuts came out on the iOS this week. I remember

4055
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:43,000
seeing that in the app store. Now my

4056
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:45,000
iPhone broke this week.

4057
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:47,000
My sleep button no longer works

4058
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:49,000
and it's really

4059
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:51,000
killed my desire to spend a lot of money

4060
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:53,000
on iOS products right now

4061
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:55,000
especially when I can't get a new iPhone until January.

4062
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:57,000
And I was talking about this a little bit on

4063
02:17:57,000 --> 02:17:59,000
Bobby's show but

4064
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:01,000
you know I'm not exactly in a

4065
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:03,000
rush to replace my iPhone. In fact

4066
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:05,000
now I'm thinking maybe I want a different phone.

4067
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:07,000
But yet I've spent all that money on apps.

4068
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:09,000
I don't know what to do.

4069
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:11,000
I guess we'll just

4070
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:13,000
take another call. Hi you're on Orange Lawns Radio. Who's this?

4071
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:15,000
This is Shane. Hey

4072
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:17,000
Shane, what's up?

4073
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:19,000
Not a whole lot. I just wanted to

4074
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:21,000
say the word Skylanders so I could

4075
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:23,000
hear the rant that Loki went on earlier

4076
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:25,000
than I missed. That's your fault for not being here at

4077
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:27,000
6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.

4078
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:29,000
I had a work thing

4079
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:31,000
I had to go to. It was pizza.

4080
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:33,000
Like I was going to pass up pizza.

4081
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:37,000
Well, Loki?

4082
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:39,000
Heard he made a rant.

4083
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:41,000
I'm just saying, you know

4084
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:43,000
yeah it's cool that your store sold out

4085
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:45,000
of them or whatever.

4086
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:47,000
I hope those four copies

4087
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:49,000
went pretty fast.

4088
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:51,000
I had more than four copies. I had like

4089
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:53,000
eight on PS3

4090
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:55,000
eight on 360, eight on Wii and four on

4091
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:57,000
3DS and then all the little

4092
02:18:57,000 --> 02:18:59,000
freaking boxes of the single

4093
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:01,000
figurines. Do you have games?

4094
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:03,000
I mean that eight doesn't sound like a lot.

4095
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:05,000
Of course granted you're in Kansas but

4096
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:07,000
I'm just saying it's six because they came

4097
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:09,000
in case slots of six so

4098
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:11,000
that's only one

4099
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:13,000
case of each. That's not a lot.

4100
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:15,000
I'm curious if there's other games

4101
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:17,000
that maybe have the potential to sell eight copies

4102
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:19,000
in a day. I mean that doesn't sound like that many.

4103
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:21,000
Well across multiple

4104
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:23,000
systems on a Sunday release

4105
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:25,000
that's not a Nintendo game is

4106
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:27,000
pretty significant. I'm optimistic

4107
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:29,000
that they're going to fail still.

4108
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:31,000
Although I did see a review

4109
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:33,000
from some site. It's the

4110
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:35,000
only review that they have right now that's like eight

4111
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:37,000
out of ten.

4112
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:39,000
Like Kotaku for example

4113
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:41,000
they're like, I think this concept is pretty awesome.

4114
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:43,000
Yeah, you think it's pretty awesome because they sent

4115
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:45,000
you five fucking copies of the game and all the

4116
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:47,000
toys. Well this looks like fun.

4117
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:49,000
The kid in me wants to open

4118
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:51,000
this up.

4119
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:53,000
Okay, fine, whatever.

4120
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:55,000
But reading the feedback from

4121
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:57,000
people that are looking at the trailers and stuff

4122
02:19:57,000 --> 02:19:59,000
they're like, what the fuck happened to Spyro?

4123
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:01,000
What have they done to this guy?

4124
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:03,000
It's pretty mean now and like the

4125
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:05,000
3DS one comes with a black version like

4126
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:07,000
an evil Spyro or something.

4127
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:09,000
And that was kind of

4128
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:11,000
cool looking but he still didn't look like Spyro.

4129
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:13,000
Let me kind of

4130
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:15,000
turn this on you and ask you about something that we

4131
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:17,000
also talked about in the beginning of the show. No, yes.

4132
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:19,000
Because last week on the show you were here defending Final Fantasy

4133
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:21,000
XIV and saying I should play it again.

4134
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:23,000
And I did. And I talked about that

4135
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:25,000
at the top of the show. Which you said was pretty

4136
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:27,000
negative sounding. Well, it mixed.

4137
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:29,000
I would say I gave it a mixed review because there are

4138
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:31,000
things I like about it. Like the

4139
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:33,000
whole way you can mix and match

4140
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:35,000
your talents. And I thought there's so much

4141
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:37,000
more to do for a single player now.

4142
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:39,000
And I realized that a lot of the crafting

4143
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:41,000
jobs are really there for the single player

4144
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:43,000
experience. Like you're not exactly going to party up

4145
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:45,000
to go do botany together.

4146
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:47,000
Like that's really part of the single player game.

4147
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:49,000
Ooh, but we should because that would be hilarious.

4148
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:51,000
But my

4149
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:53,000
real question for you is

4150
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:55,000
and then just so you know the bottom line is it's

4151
02:20:55,000 --> 02:20:57,000
better and it's much better than fucking garbage

4152
02:20:57,000 --> 02:20:59,000
which is what I called it last time. But

4153
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:01,000
I'm not going to pay the monthly fee.

4154
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:03,000
And that was the news that came out this week is that

4155
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:05,000
now they're charging a monthly fee for Final Fantasy XIV.

4156
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:07,000
You didn't know that last week. What's

4157
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:09,000
your reaction to all the news about Final Fantasy

4158
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:11,000
XIV this week?

4159
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:13,000
In regards to the monthly fee

4160
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:15,000
I feel like it's way too early

4161
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:17,000
and I also feel like that's

4162
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:19,000
not what the dev team

4163
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:21,000
was going for

4164
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:23,000
because recently in a post

4165
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:25,000
they said that the game's

4166
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:27,000
only like halfway to where they want it to be

4167
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:29,000
and they weren't going to start charging a fee till it was

4168
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:31,000
100% that way. So clearly that came

4169
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:33,000
from the top down.

4170
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:35,000
I don't feel like

4171
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:37,000
it's really ready for a monthly fee

4172
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:39,000
but I will pay it because I am

4173
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:41,000
having fun. And

4174
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:43,000
in terms of like the other things

4175
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:45,000
they announced like completely rebooting the game

4176
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:47,000
again, I'm actually kind of

4177
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:49,000
excited for that because the one fake little

4178
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:51,000
screenshot they made looked really cool

4179
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:53,000
and they're adding classes I care about

4180
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:55,000
and it's more Final Fantasy now.

4181
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:57,000
It sounds like

4182
02:21:57,000 --> 02:21:59,000
really Final Fantasy XI

4183
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:01,000
II with all the changes

4184
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:03,000
they're doing. You know I got to admit from that

4185
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:05,000
screenshot I don't know why but I was thinking

4186
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:07,000
like it looked like Phantasy Star Online

4187
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:09,000
with Final Fantasy characters. That would be

4188
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:11,000
amazing especially since we

4189
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:13,000
probably aren't getting Phantasy Star Online 2.

4190
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:15,000
It was one sexy looking screenshot.

4191
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:17,000
It is a concept

4192
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:19,000
I mean it's not until

4193
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:21,000
it's in my hot little hands.

4194
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:23,000
And it seems weird to me that they're going to make the graphics

4195
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:25,000
look better yet allow the game to run

4196
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:27,000
on lower end PCs. It's just about

4197
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:29,000
optimization though from what I understand.

4198
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:31,000
This game is horribly optimized for

4199
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:33,000
anything. Once again though

4200
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:35,000
we're talking like a year's time

4201
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:37,000
that this thing is going to be

4202
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:39,000
fully rebooted. I mean

4203
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:41,000
I just can only imagine

4204
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:43,000
the games are going to look still even

4205
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:45,000
better than they are now.

4206
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:47,000
To me it's almost

4207
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:49,000
like the

4208
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:51,000
Wii U I guess. You know how they're kind of late

4209
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:53,000
to the game with everything and it's like

4210
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:55,000
oh look we're pushing these HD graphics

4211
02:22:55,000 --> 02:22:57,000
that everyone else has been putting out for like

4212
02:22:57,000 --> 02:22:59,000
years now.

4213
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:01,000
It kind of seems like to me.

4214
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:03,000
But it still looks sexy.

4215
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:05,000
Will it be good enough for me to play?

4216
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:07,000
Well it does have the uniqueness of being a Japanese MMO

4217
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:09,000
that's pretty big here in the states.

4218
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:11,000
You know at least Final Fantasy 11 is.

4219
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:13,000
You know and there's not a lot of

4220
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:15,000
Asian in general no matter what

4221
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:17,000
country MMOs that do

4222
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:19,000
very well here. Most of the MMOs that are doing

4223
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:21,000
well here are developed by

4224
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:23,000
studios that are here. Like WoW

4225
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:25,000
of course is the big one developed by Blizzard.

4226
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:27,000
So you know I don't know.

4227
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:29,000
I guess

4228
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:31,000
that was really all I wanted to ask you was about

4229
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:33,000
Final Fantasy 14 and where you're at with that.

4230
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:35,000
So are you going to be paying for WoW and Final Fantasy

4231
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:37,000
14 or are you saying you're like

4232
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:39,000
into 14 so much you might cancel WoW?

4233
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:41,000
Yeah I might.

4234
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:43,000
It depends on what Blizzcon says this week.

4235
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:45,000
And

4236
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:47,000
how fun 4.3 is.

4237
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:49,000
Also when it comes out

4238
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:51,000
because who knows how long that is. But I'm just sick of

4239
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:53,000
you know grinding rep in

4240
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:55,000
Firelands and

4241
02:23:55,000 --> 02:23:57,000
jumping. So Final Fantasy

4242
02:23:57,000 --> 02:23:59,000
14 is something pretty and distracting right now right?

4243
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:01,000
Yes. And it's still free

4244
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:03,000
because they said they'll give us ample

4245
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:05,000
notice of when it actually goes to pay.

4246
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:07,000
And I'm guessing it's more

4247
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:09,000
like early December instead of

4248
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:11,000
late November. So I still have like

4249
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:13,000
two months. I'm wondering

4250
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:15,000
how my 30 day trial is going to play into it.

4251
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:17,000
I totally am going to get screwed with that.

4252
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:19,000
Like my 30 day trial will be up and then the

4253
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:21,000
fee kicks in. It's like I didn't get

4254
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:23,000
shit. I didn't get shit

4255
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:25,000
like everybody else got. Oh well.

4256
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:27,000
Oh well I'm part of that too. I mean I've only been

4257
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:29,000
playing for what a week longer than you? You didn't

4258
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:31,000
even buy the damn game. It was conked to you.

4259
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:33,000
That's true. So shut up.

4260
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:35,000
I didn't get it for free.

4261
02:24:35,000 --> 02:24:37,000
I paid 25 bucks for it.

4262
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:39,000
I paid half what most people

4263
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:41,000
paid for it new but I still paid 25 bucks

4264
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:43,000
for it. And then my DVD

4265
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:45,000
was damaged. And screw that.

4266
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:47,000
Square needs to learn

4267
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:49,000
how to make a PC game for fuck's sake.

4268
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:51,000
Alright. I do think the game

4269
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:53,000
is going to be pretty neat on Playstation 3.

4270
02:24:53,000 --> 02:24:55,000
Yeah. I think I might

4271
02:24:55,000 --> 02:24:57,000
jump to that when it comes out.

4272
02:24:57,000 --> 02:24:59,000
Do you think the game can save itself?

4273
02:24:59,000 --> 02:25:01,000
Like do you think a game can actually

4274
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:03,000
relaunch and

4275
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:05,000
be credible? I think

4276
02:25:05,000 --> 02:25:07,000
I think it can.

4277
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:09,000
But probably not to the extent

4278
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:11,000
that they're hoping for.

4279
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:13,000
Like I think it'll bring in a few more

4280
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:15,000
people. It'll probably keep

4281
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:17,000
the current players. But it's not

4282
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:19,000
going to be a huge

4283
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:21,000
relaunch. Despite what they

4284
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:23,000
want. You're not going to get thousands

4285
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:25,000
and thousands of more people playing.

4286
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:27,000
I think honestly the smart thing for them to do is

4287
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:29,000
to go to the Guild Wars model where you're not totally

4288
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:31,000
free to play. But once you buy the game

4289
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:33,000
you get to play online for free. And they

4290
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:35,000
should look at doing expansions for money.

4291
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:37,000
Or just you know more regular content

4292
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:39,000
updates like what they're doing with Final Fantasy 11

4293
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:41,000
that cost money. And that

4294
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:43,000
that's how they should do it. They did that. I'd buy it.

4295
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:45,000
For sure. The monthly fee is not

4296
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:47,000
going to work for this game anymore. Except for Final Fantasy 11

4297
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:49,000
does those little

4298
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:51,000
baby expansions and still charges you

4299
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:53,000
a monthly fee. But Final Fantasy 11 is also

4300
02:25:53,000 --> 02:25:55,000
a better game. Ooh

4301
02:25:55,000 --> 02:25:57,000
that's true.

4302
02:25:57,000 --> 02:25:59,000
It's not as pretty.

4303
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:01,000
Alright on that note I'm going to let you go alright?

4304
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:03,000
Alright. Alright take care. Bye.

4305
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:05,000
Alright I guess that's

4306
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:07,000
all I'm going to do over the Skype line tonight.

4307
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:09,000
Sorry to those of you that didn't get through.

4308
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:11,000
But why don't you think about writing us an email.

4309
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:13,000
Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com

4310
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:15,000
is the place to send us an email if you'd like.

4311
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:17,000
Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com or of course

4312
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:19,000
Twitter. We had a very empty Twitter tonight. I'm very

4313
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:21,000
sad. Twitter.com slash

4314
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:23,000
O-L-R. Alright.

4315
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:25,000
Well that's going to wrap up another show. I've got to

4316
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:27,000
ask though Dark Soccer and Loki if they have any last minute

4317
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:29,000
stories they want to throw out here. I've

4318
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:31,000
started a political social blog.

4319
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:33,000
Oh dear.

4320
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:35,000
Wait a minute. Women think independently now?

4321
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:37,000
I'm teasing.

4322
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:41,000
Girl.

4323
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:43,000
She's trying very hard not

4324
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:45,000
to laugh. Like she wants to give me that stern

4325
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:47,000
I hate you look but she can't do it. Rob's going to take

4326
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:49,000
me to Pinkberry to appease me.

4327
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:51,000
Whatever. Alright.

4328
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:53,000
Vote no on that.

4329
02:26:53,000 --> 02:26:55,000
That's my political blog.

4330
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:57,000
Alright. You know I'm just giving you a hard

4331
02:26:57,000 --> 02:26:59,000
time. Yeah I know. Good luck with that. That's what

4332
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:01,000
you're. I was going to

4333
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:03,000
do another joke but I can't.

4334
02:27:03,000 --> 02:27:05,000
No it's my second blog. Alright.

4335
02:27:05,000 --> 02:27:07,000
Cause my other blog's like about

4336
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:09,000
girly shit. Okay. Alright.

4337
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:11,000
Alright. Loki

4338
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:13,000
any last minute news you want to get into?

4339
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:15,000
They're supposed to be doing a

4340
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:17,000
Layton Brothers game for iPhone

4341
02:27:17,000 --> 02:27:19,000
sometime soon. I'm assuming this is

4342
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:21,000
only going to be on the Japanese IS so.

4343
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:23,000
It's neat though if you

4344
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:25,000
want to play you know Layton.

4345
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:27,000
Yeah Layton's a good series. It'll be fun on the iPhone.

4346
02:27:27,000 --> 02:27:29,000
Let me go to the chat room cause we

4347
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:31,000
haven't read enough of chat tonight and I apologize.

4348
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:33,000
I'm watching you guys but we just haven't had a whole lot

4349
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:35,000
of stuff I've been able to work into the show.

4350
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:37,000
Plus live listeners are really behind tonight.

4351
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:39,000
Not of any fault of your guyses. Like I just

4352
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:41,000
noticed the delay is like several minutes tonight

4353
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:43,000
so I don't know what's up. But anyway.

4354
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:45,000
I want to read this cause this guy said

4355
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:47,000
after five years listening he's finally listening to

4356
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:49,000
a live show. It's Swongtong

4357
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:51,000
his name in chat and Swongtong asks

4358
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:53,000
how come MMOs on Playstation

4359
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:55,000
3 don't use the mouse and keyboard?

4360
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:57,000
Actually some

4361
02:27:57,000 --> 02:27:59,000
do and I believe Final Fantasy 14

4362
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:01,000
is still they're going to plan on using a keyboard

4363
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:03,000
even when it rolls out to the Playstation 3.

4364
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:05,000
And everything on

4365
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:07,000
Playstation 3 is all Bluetooth

4366
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:09,000
and USB anyway right? Like I know

4367
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:11,000
on Xbox 360 you can hook in a keyboard

4368
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:13,000
you can play Final Fantasy 11 on 360

4369
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:15,000
with a keyboard. I used to do that

4370
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:17,000
when it first came out. So

4371
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:19,000
as far as Playstation 3 goes you can

4372
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:21,000
put in a keyboard. You can

4373
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:23,000
type messages and so forth.

4374
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:25,000
As far as MMOs embracing it

4375
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:27,000
well maybe the keyboard adoption policy isn't

4376
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:29,000
maybe high enough to do that but I think for a game like

4377
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:31,000
Final Fantasy 14 like if I were to play that on

4378
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:33,000
the Playstation 3 I definitely would have to have

4379
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:35,000
a keyboard. Luckily I already

4380
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:37,000
have one that's specifically for

4381
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:39,000
the gaming consoles. It lights up blue it's really

4382
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:41,000
pretty. Alright.

4383
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:43,000
Loki any other stories for

4384
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:45,000
us tonight?

4385
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:47,000
No

4386
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:49,000
the only other story I have is not really gaming

4387
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:51,000
related but my wife is trying to

4388
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:53,000
download the version

4389
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:55,000
of Firefox that is British

4390
02:28:55,000 --> 02:28:57,000
English so that all of her

4391
02:28:57,000 --> 02:28:59,000
stuff will be spell checked into

4392
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:01,000
the Queen's English because she's

4393
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:03,000
obsessed with Game

4394
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:05,000
of Thrones and I don't know why.

4395
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:07,000
Tell her

4396
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:09,000
she better start learning to use more vowels.

4397
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:11,000
I would have put that on Dark Soccer to do

4398
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:13,000
something like that before Nelly.

4399
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:15,000
I've done it before. Okay

4400
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:17,000
never mind I stand clear. Well no I've actually

4401
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:19,000
got a British

4402
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:21,000
grammar checker. Okay.

4403
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:23,000
Because well every so

4404
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:25,000
okay here's a true story. Use less z's

4405
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:27,000
and more u's there you go.

4406
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:29,000
In college I actually had this whole thing

4407
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:31,000
where I was doing nothing but writing everything in British English

4408
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:33,000
and my teacher let me do it he just said pick one

4409
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:35,000
and write in it.

4410
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:37,000
So every so often

4411
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:39,000
less z's. Excuse me.

4412
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:41,000
Fewer z's.

4413
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:43,000
Alright.

4414
02:29:43,000 --> 02:29:45,000
Don't use that.

4415
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:47,000
What? The z word.

4416
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:49,000
I guess that's it.

4417
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:51,000
So we're going around and getting everybody's final thought

4418
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:53,000
and wrapping up another week here at Orange Laundry.

4419
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:55,000
Before we do that I really want to thank you guys again

4420
02:29:55,000 --> 02:29:57,000
for tuning in and spending another week with us.

4421
02:29:57,000 --> 02:29:59,000
Thank you so much. You know all we ask we do this

4422
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:01,000
for free. You'll notice there's no advertising or

4423
02:30:01,000 --> 02:30:03,000
anything like that except for our own other side

4424
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:05,000
projects. Which by the way include

4425
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:07,000
the best little Horde house in Azeroth at Hordehouse.com

4426
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:09,000
if you like your Warcraft. We had a fun show

4427
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:11,000
tonight. In fact we taped earlier today. This is my second

4428
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:13,000
podcast of the day. But other than

4429
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:15,000
ads for our own side projects. And you know

4430
02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:17,000
someone has not been putting album art

4431
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:19,000
on Facebook. Because I like to see

4432
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:21,000
which ones get put up. Because they're

4433
02:30:21,000 --> 02:30:23,000
funny. I've been putting them on Facebook.

4434
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:25,000
Oh I haven't upgraded the gallery. You're right.

4435
02:30:25,000 --> 02:30:27,000
But if you go in and look at the posts they're there.

4436
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:29,000
But they're teeny.

4437
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:31,000
Then go to Hordehouse.com. Alright.

4438
02:30:31,000 --> 02:30:33,000
Because they're teeny. Alright I'll get the big ones

4439
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:35,000
on Facebook. But anyway.

4440
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:37,000
What I really want to say is thank you guys very

4441
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:39,000
much for tuning in. Thank you for supporting our show.

4442
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:41,000
The OL Army which is what we call

4443
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:43,000
our fans make this all worth it. And

4444
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:45,000
keep us motivated to do this for years and years.

4445
02:30:45,000 --> 02:30:47,000
If you like the show all

4446
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:49,000
we ask. Tell a friend. Tell

4447
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:51,000
somebody about the show. Word of mouth is all we

4448
02:30:51,000 --> 02:30:53,000
got. We're not funded by a million dollar magazine.

4449
02:30:53,000 --> 02:30:55,000
So please. Please help us spread the

4450
02:30:55,000 --> 02:30:57,000
word. And again I'll just say the podcast

4451
02:30:57,000 --> 02:30:59,000
awards. Great way to help spread the word. So

4452
02:30:59,000 --> 02:31:01,000
please consider throwing us your vote over

4453
02:31:01,000 --> 02:31:03,000
in that contest at podcastawards.com.

4454
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:05,000
And one more

4455
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:07,000
shout out to our buddies at The Geek Spin who are

4456
02:31:07,000 --> 02:31:09,000
also nominated. And we hope that even

4457
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:11,000
if we can't win we hope they do.

4458
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:13,000
They're in best pod safe music.

4459
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:15,000
In a perfect world we both win. But you know

4460
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:17,000
we don't always get what we want.

4461
02:31:17,000 --> 02:31:19,000
We don't always get what we want. Alright.

4462
02:31:19,000 --> 02:31:21,000
Anyhow. Let's go

4463
02:31:21,000 --> 02:31:23,000
around and get everybody's final thought.

4464
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:25,000
Loki. What's your final thought tonight?

4465
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:27,000
I am

4466
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:29,000
now telling my wife how to

4467
02:31:29,000 --> 02:31:31,000
add a British

4468
02:31:31,000 --> 02:31:33,000
English spell check

4469
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:35,000
to it. And I unfortunately had to add it

4470
02:31:35,000 --> 02:31:37,000
to mine in order to figure out how to do it. So now I

4471
02:31:37,000 --> 02:31:39,000
can talk in the Queen's English if I really wanted

4472
02:31:39,000 --> 02:31:41,000
to. But

4473
02:31:41,000 --> 02:31:43,000
I don't want to.

4474
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:45,000
Congratulations. You'll have to start

4475
02:31:45,000 --> 02:31:47,000
tweeting in the Queen's English.

4476
02:31:47,000 --> 02:31:49,000
Speaking of the Queen. Dark Soccer. Your final thought

4477
02:31:49,000 --> 02:31:51,000
tonight.

4478
02:31:51,000 --> 02:31:53,000
I am disillusioned with this country.

4479
02:31:53,000 --> 02:31:55,000
My final

4480
02:31:55,000 --> 02:31:57,000
thought tonight is Pretty Rainbow.

4481
02:31:57,000 --> 02:31:59,000
Pretty Rainbow.

4482
02:31:59,000 --> 02:32:01,000
Where? Your dresser's

4483
02:32:01,000 --> 02:32:03,000
little drawers there. Oh yeah.

4484
02:32:03,000 --> 02:32:05,000
Actually that is why I bought it. Alright.

4485
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:07,000
That's it. Thank you guys for tuning

4486
02:32:07,000 --> 02:32:09,000
in and listening to us. We'll do it again

4487
02:32:09,000 --> 02:32:11,000
next week. Dark Soccer is next week your week

4488
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:13,000
off or is that two weeks? No it's not the week after.

4489
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:15,000
Alright so we'll all be back here then

4490
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:17,000
next week. So until then

4491
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:19,000
have a wonderful night. Be safe.

4492
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:21,000
And please when you're gaming online

4493
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:43,000
don't be a dick. Good night.

4494
02:32:51,000 --> 02:32:53,000
See you next week.
