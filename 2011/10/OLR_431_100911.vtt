I'm back after a little bit of a vacation

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
Joy

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
My name is

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
Stop trying to sound so hurt about it

01:15.000 --> 01:22.000
My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining over the next few hours with my sometimes questionable co-host

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
Hi

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers

01:25.000 --> 01:29.000
You know, it's almost as if you never left, we had such a derpy

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
I heard about the derpisodes while I was gone

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
Yes, we called them derpisodes

01:32.000 --> 01:37.000
I haven't heard, just like the podcast listeners which I apologize for in advance, I haven't heard last week's

01:37.000 --> 01:41.000
But I heard about half of the one from two weeks ago on the commute to work

01:41.000 --> 01:46.000
The one from two weeks ago was like two minutes

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
Yeah, you guys just flew through the news

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
And I did like a bajillion hours to pump up the volume

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
Not tonight though, oh my god we have a huge show tonight

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
We have like big announcements, big stuff to talk about tonight

01:56.000 --> 02:01.000
Of course I have to introduce the other guy here on the show, say hello to tech master Loki

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
And I'll have you know for the record, I'm always questionable

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
What?

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
I can't wait to hear your last one

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
Oh you can be questionable, I'll just be questioning

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
Huh?

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
What?

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
Huh?

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
Why?

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
Why?

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
Why?

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
Okay, so yeah, I've been gone for a couple weeks

02:18.000 --> 02:22.000
And I gotta say, at first I apologize, especially the podcast folks

02:22.000 --> 02:26.000
Because the podcast feed is behind a week right now and that's pretty much my fault

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
I've been extremely busy

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
Now I know what you're gonna think though, like yeah, the reason why I miss the shows

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
I went to a rock concert two weeks ago

02:33.000 --> 02:37.000
Look, it's a band I've missed like three times

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
And I said I am seeing Lady Tron this time come hell or high water

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
And it rocked

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
But they only want you when you're 17

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
And then last week, when you're 21 you're no fun

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
Last week I went to Disneyland, I know rough life right

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
But I came back to just craziness at work

02:52.000 --> 02:56.000
And I had this performance I was doing last night

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
I participated in a local production of Repo the genetic opera

03:00.000 --> 03:04.000
Yes the movie, they do shadow casting for that now a la Rocky Horror

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
Which as you guys may or may not know, Rocky Horror is kind of the reason

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
I got into podcasting in the first place

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
Because Rocky Horror led to Undersedation Live

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
The show I used to be on led to this show

03:13.000 --> 03:17.000
So I still support actively the Rocky Horror community

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
And this show leads to neurosis

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
I can talk about this now

03:21.000 --> 03:26.000
There actually was a surprise cameo of the song Sweet Transvestite in Repo

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
So I played Riff Raff on stage but I had to keep it a secret

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
I wanted to tell people I couldn't because it was all a surprise

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
And the crowd went wild and it was a great show man

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
When they did some of the killing scenes

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
They did that whole thing where the blood sprays out in the audience

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
Over the first five rows, it was awesome

03:41.000 --> 03:45.000
So big kudos to the folks here in SAC that made that happen

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
And my friend played Blind Mag

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
Yes, she was phenomenal

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
She was really good

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
Oh my gosh, I loved her, she was as they would say, fierce

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
I didn't get to go last night, I wanted to

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
But she has that dramatic quality in life

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
And I don't want to ruin the movie too much

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
But it's been out a few years now

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
She has a pretty dramatic death scene that's very over the top

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
And just awesome to watch

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
So, anyhow

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
Only good role Sarah Silverman has ever done

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
Wait, you mean Sarah Brightman?

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
Sarah Brightman, why does it say Silverman?

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
Sarah Brightman

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
Keep in mind

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
Were you thinking of your fellow Jews? Is that what it was?

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
I guess so

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
Yom Kippur has taken over your life

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
But Sarah Brightman, I've made no secret of this

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
I think she's way too brassy as a soprano

04:31.000 --> 04:35.000
And I know that Christine was for her for Phantom of the Opera

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
But you know what?

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
Hate her in it, hate her, hate her, hate her, hate her

04:38.000 --> 04:42.000
But she was really, really good as Blind Mag

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
Yes, I agree

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
And to bring this back to games

04:46.000 --> 04:51.000
Repo, even though some people don't really like it as a movie

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
And say it's a terrible movie, because it is a little weird

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
It's the guy who did Saw doing a rock opera

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
And like opera, meaning everything is a song

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
But Tony Head

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
Anthony's to her head

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
Hello

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
And it's told in that kind of comic book style

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
And it's just neat, it's something you should see

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
Anyhow

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
And they should make a game out of it

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
Back to video games for a minute

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
Obviously this has been like everywhere this week

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
But we have to mention it, we have to

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
Steve Jobs passed away this week

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
And it's kind of one of those things, it's insanely sad

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
I know it's all been all over CNN

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
And especially all over Twitter and Facebook and so forth

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
I know you guys have heard a lot about it

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
But how could we not tip our hat to Steve Jobs

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
And obviously, he did a lot for podcasting

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
He didn't invent podcasting

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
But definitely what happened with iTunes

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
Propelled it into the stratosphere

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
And we have a lot to thank for that, for the exposure

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
And plus, it was called podcasting in the beginning

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
Even before iTunes, because

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
And we were actually doing a show back before iTunes

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
That's how long the show's been going on

05:53.000 --> 05:57.000
Your old RSS would kind of

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
You could get these programs that would actually

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
Still sync them to your iPod

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
Because they weren't iPhones back then, but iPods

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
And you kind of sync it that way

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
And so there were ways to do what iTunes was doing before that

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
But it was always designed with that portable

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
On the go thing in mind

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
I think it's important to mention, Steve Jobs contributed a lot

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
To things that don't even start with an eye

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
So regardless to how you feel about Apple

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
Well, okay, I got one Apple thing I gotta say though

06:22.000 --> 06:26.000
Is that him and Woz did the Apple IIe

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
That was a huge thing

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
And that was like, hello childhood school

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
In the garage

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
Well, the original Apple was in the garage

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
But yeah, that leads to Apple II

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
Which is what we all, like anybody who grew up in the 80s

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
We all did

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
How many of us played Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
On one of those rectangular bricks?

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
Or Oregon Trail

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
Or Math Blasters

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
You know, that was a huge part of our education

06:52.000 --> 06:56.000
And I think, you know, to me it was always like

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
Really looking forward to Computer Lab Day

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
I'm sure you other nerds feel the same way, right?

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
It was just like, Computer Lab Day was awesome

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
We didn't have computers in Alabama

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
Really? Oh

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
No, we had like

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
I actually believed you for a minute

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
We actually had one Apple IIe in the library

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
Which I would just go play all the time

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
And then we had like the tall brick Macs

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
You know what I mean?

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
Right

07:21.000 --> 07:26.000
At a couple of the facilities that I used to do volunteer work at

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
And if it wasn't for him, we wouldn't have the MacBook

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
And we wouldn't have been able to upload the virus to the alien mothership

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
To save the world on Independence Day

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
Absolutely, absolutely

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
Very important contribution is that Steve Jobs

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
Did contribute to saving us from virus

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
Virus, Mac OS, same thing

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
Even back in the day

07:45.000 --> 07:50.000
The first really good graphics programs were developed on Mac

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
And that's why, I mean

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
And Macs were in schools everywhere

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
Especially when you and I were growing up

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
And Loki, Macs were everywhere

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
In our schools

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
And that was a really smart ploy on Apple's part

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
But certainly you get attached

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
I was in yearbook

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
Which I know is something very similar to what you do now

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
You might not do yearbook, but you do publishing

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
And we did that shit on PageMaker on a Mac

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
It was good times

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
And now we're like, did you use PageMaker?

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
InDesign, hello

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
But yeah, but Adobe

08:21.000 --> 08:25.000
Even fully supported the Mac platform

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
For ages until they finally realized

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
Oh yeah, PC's caught up, oops

08:29.000 --> 08:33.000
And there was also the gaming connection too on the 2600

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
Jobs had played a role in

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
Breakout on the Atari 2600

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
That's one of the more kind of, I mean

08:39.000 --> 08:43.000
Woz talked about how he kind of got shafted

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
On the Atari bonus on that game

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
But regardless of all that

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
And how things went down

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
He did kind of have that more direct impact on the gaming industry

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
And I gotta say this you guys

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
This is the one that people forget about

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
Not everybody, but some people have forgot about

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
CNN stuff, I think is the most important

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
In some ways, things that he did

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
He brought Pixar

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
Back, and like, Pixar

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
Is amazing

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
The movies they make and everything

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
If you hate every single Pixar movie that's ever been made

09:11.000 --> 09:15.000
I question your taste, I'm sorry to say

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
But like, you know, and I

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
Pixar has made some that you may not like

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
Like I know not everybody dug Cars 2 or Ratatouille

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
Or A Bug's Life

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
But seriously, like, Wall-E

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
Up, Toy Story

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
1, 2, or 3, take your pick

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
How often does a movie like that have so many great sequels?

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
Right?

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
I do have to say though

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
Most CG movies today

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
Are made in Linux-based programs

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
Well, you know, but

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
Whether it was Apple PC or what

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
Jobs bought that company in the 80s

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
And had that vision of making

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
An animated movie out of computers

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
And, you know, a lot of people kind of pass that off

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
And there's still some today

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
That kind of feel that, well, traditional animation is best

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
And, you know, I think

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
I think we're getting to a place where you get

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
A good mix of the two, like there's been some great

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
Traditionally animated ones, like I like Princess and the Frog

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
An awful lot, but

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
Boo!

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
What, you don't like that movie? It was terrible

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
I haven't seen it. I thought it was great. Hater.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
Alright, but then there's some, you know, obviously the stuff

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
Pixar does, even up through like Tangled

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
Were really, really good movies, even though I know Tangled

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
Was not technically Pixar, but

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
I mean, you look at DreamWorks

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
Look at any of them, I mean, basically

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
Pixar really innovated the

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
The genre

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
So, um, so yeah

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
A tip of the hat to a guy

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
Who, um, was very sassy

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
Too, like in the way he ran his company

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
Was very unlike other CEOs

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
So, a tip of the hat to Steve Jobs

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
And rest in peace

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
Sadly, I think we all kind of, I mean

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
When it happened, it was like, oh wow, but I think we all

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
Kind of, you know, we all kind of knew

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
When it happened, I was like

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
Oh, it finally did, because he had been

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
Very holistic in his approach

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
Towards his cancer treatment

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
And while I'm a big fan

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
Of holistic treatments

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
For something like that

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
I don't condone it

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
Well, and he had issues

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
No matter what you believe in

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
He had issues with his pancreas

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
And you just, the pancreas is like your heart

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
If it gets damaged, you can't live without it

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
And, you know

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
In some ways, this kind of new strikes

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
Close to home, because you guys may or may not remember

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
If you've been listening long enough, back in 2008

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
I had a pretty serious medical issue that

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
Took me out of the show for a few weeks, and it was pancreatitis

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
And it's no joke

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
And I was very scared there for a minute

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
When they had to do the MRI on it

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
Because they told me flat out they had to rule out

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
Pancreatic cancer, because I had a growth on my pancreas

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
Thank heavens it was just a cyst

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
So, you know, I

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
Absolutely feel, and I know it had to be

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
A great deal of pain

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
And now it's been stopped and desisted

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
Well, in his case, you know

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
I meant for you. Oh, for me?

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
Stopped and desisted

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
Oh, I get it, desisted, har har

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
But no, at least for him, he's not in pain anymore

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
Like, he was up on the stage as late as

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
What, April? He did that?

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
The Stanford thing too

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
That was before, but yeah

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
But April was the whole iCloud thing

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
And so, you know, he was on stage for that

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
So when you consider that was six months before

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
He ultimately passed away

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
You know, I'm just glad he's not in pain anymore

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
And I hope his family and all that

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
Is doing

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
Okay

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
Alright, so on to

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
I'm just gonna turn the car, complete 180

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
Like really, really sad news to really

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
Alright, we're going back

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
Now we're going to Disneyland, everybody

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
So

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
We mentioned a couple weeks ago

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
On the show that we really appreciated

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
If you guys would nominate us for the podcast award

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
Which we won back in like 2005

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
But I don't even think we've been nominated since

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
Maybe like one time, I don't remember

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
But it's mostly been, especially in those first

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
Couple years, 06, 07

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
A lot of like the corporate cast

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
And you know, a

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
nomination in there would go a long way towards

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
Exposure for the show and everything and

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
Oh my god, we got nominated, we did

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
It was announced yesterday, we got nominated

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
Podcastwords.com if you want to check it out

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
It's amazing

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
And what's really amazing, I'm gonna be honest

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
You know, the other shows that are nominated

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
Like, I think all but one

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
Or maybe two of them are indie shows

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
You're talking like ten shows

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
And there's some awesome indie shows in there

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
And so I feel very confident

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
That some indie is gonna

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
Walk away with it

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
And that's great, you know

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
And indie's gonna be getting the exposure

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
Although I'd rather be our indie show

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
Well sure, not gonna lie

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
It would be awfully nice

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
No, I want us to be nominated just to lose

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
It would be awfully nice

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
But, you know

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
If you don't vote for us, we'll eat wet cigarette butts

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
Don't care

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
We'll throw a protest, no

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
Obviously we would love a vote

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
And voting opens on the 12th

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
Podcastwords.com

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
It's this interesting thing where you have to vote every day

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
So please vote often

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
And yeah

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
We would really appreciate it

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
That would be great

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
But win or lose, we're gonna just keep doing what we always do, right kids?

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
Yeah, being awesome

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
I'm gonna quit if we lose

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
I'm done, stomp

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
Alright

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
Let's move on and talk about

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
We gotta get back to video games

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
Let's talk about our gaming weeks

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
And the stuff that we have been playing this week

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
So DarkStalker, we'll start with you

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
How was your gaming week?

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
I really haven't played much of anything

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
I mean, just because I've been super busy with school

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
Excuses, excuses

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
I was on, well, just long enough to do dailies

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
And that's it, really

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
I mean, I did like one instance

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
But like, yesterday

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
It was Yom Kippur

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
Oh yeah

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
Honestly, I have to say that it was

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
You know, people complain

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
About fasting

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
And oh, I'm so tired

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
But for me, it was actually kind of good to step away from everything

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
Is Yom Kippur like no technology, either?

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
Well, on top of that, it was on a Shabbat, regardless

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
So that means that

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
Technically, if you're gonna observe it, then yeah, no

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
Nothing creative

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
No Facebook, no games, nothing creative

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
No writing

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
You read Torah, you read commentaries

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
Oh, okay, I was like, are you allowed to read on the Kindle?

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
Only if it's a Torah?

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
Oh yeah, I guess if I was reading Torah, commentary on the Kindle, I could do that, yeah

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
But I mean, it's

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
But for me, it was just sort of like

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
Stepping away from everything

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
You know, I turned off my phone

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
I turned off my computer

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
You know, I

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
And yeah, the fasting thing is never fun

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
But

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
I spent a lot more time around people

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
I gotta say

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
You know, my friends, some of my friends

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
And I used to do a trip

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
Sadly, we don't do it anymore

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
We used to do a trip every year to Mendocino

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
Off the grid

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
Because you literally don't have cell service when you're that close to the ocean

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
And you know, just

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
It was actually a really neat trip

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
And it forced me to get away from all that and just be with people

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
Which was great

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
So I have to say that actually

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
It's been a good week of disconnecting

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
From

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
The games and the internet

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
So your gaming week has consisted of

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
Being anti-technology

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
It was a vacation

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
And then I found a game that I totally

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
Have to have

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
And that's that Kirby

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
10 Kirby game

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
Where it's like Kirby's broken up into 10 parts

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
And you have to find all of his parts

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
And then you attack things by throwing a bunch of Kirby's at it

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
I want that game

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
Mass attack, that's it, I want that game

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
Go get it!

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
I broke

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
I will fill in for your gaming week then

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
Since you were on a religious observance

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
And so forth through the week

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
What some folks in chat have been playing

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
YYR in our chatroom says

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
I bought a Turbo Duo with 11 games

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
Not that I have much less played or anything

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
Because this show is rated TG-16

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
Um

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
And Tidalitis

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
Hope I said that right, said my gaming week

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
Street Fighter III Third Strike Online

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
Bought DJ Hero 2 on a whim at Big Lots

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
Well if they were selling it at Big Lots

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
That means it was probably 10 bucks

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
Hence why he probably got it on a whim

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
It's a good whim

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
I think DJ Hero is a pretty underrated series

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
It's unfortunately like

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
The other music games that I played

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
I buy it

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
I get all excited about it, play it a little bit

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
And then it goes away for a while

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
But then eventually once I have

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
Nothing to do

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
I'll go back and play it again

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
It didn't have fabulous longevity

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
And I think the fact that it has such a large controller

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
That you have to kind of like put away

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
Then get out, plug in

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
I think honestly when people want to play

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
Sometimes they just want to turn on the system and go

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
So I don't know

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
But yeah, DJ Hero at least was a great game

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
Alright Loki, how was your gaming week?

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
Uh, it was pretty good

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
I played a few things

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
Grand Theft Auto, barely

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
Because our firewall has been

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
Absolute shit

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
Apparently Microsoft went down

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
Live went down for a little bit

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
On Monday

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
And for some reason after that

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
Our firewall has been just absolute shit

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
We were lucky to get 4 out of the 5

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
Consoles connected to live

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
In a game together

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
And actually be able to stay in

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
It has been more of like

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
Oh, let's see whose console stays online

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
Long enough for us to fish the game

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
And sometimes only two of them

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
So it kind of sucked

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
But it's still

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
Sorry, we played a little bit of that

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
And then played a little bit of Earth Defense Force

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
Just doing some farming for my

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
Jet Trooper guy

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
And then the new game that I played this week

18:27.000 --> 18:31.000
Was Dead Rising 2 Off the Record

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
Which I was really excited about that

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
And it's a pretty awesome game

18:35.000 --> 18:41.000
The only disappointment I have with the game is

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
Dead Rising 2, one of the things I hated

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
Was the fact that you have to keep going back

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
To give your stupid daughter zombrex

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
I was like, cool!

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
Dead Rising 2 Off the Record is gonna be

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
Dead Rising 2 is gonna be awesome

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
Because you don't have to do that anymore

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
No, this time

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
Frank West is infected

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
And he needs to take zombrex

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
So I was like

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
Aw, come on!

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
Thankfully, when I did that

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
When I got to that point

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
I was like, aw, come on!

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
I switched right over to sandbox mode

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
And there's none of that shit

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
So it's just killing zombies and that's it

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
Funny enough, the way the beginning of that

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
Is this game already out or is it coming out?

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
It's coming out

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
So the way it kind of begins in the sandbox mode

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
He's being dropped out of a helicopter

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
Much like the first game

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
And they're all, so are you covering your next big scoop here?

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
He's all, no, not this time

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
This is my vacation!

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
And doesn't roll onto the roof

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
And then just starts killing zombies

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
But everything transfers back and forth

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
Your experience and costumes

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
And crap that you get

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
So right now I went through a sex shop

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
So I had a bunch of

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
Weird

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
Village people-esque

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
Stuff on

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
You know, when I think of the village people

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
I don't necessarily think of sex

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
Well chaps, okay

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
Maybe it's a generation thing

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
Nah, it's more like leather chaps

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
Alright

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
Just for whatever reason

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
I was just picking up all the clothes on the way

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
Whatever ends up happening, that's fine

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
But now I have this weird mask and bull horns

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
On my head, so

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
Not gonna lie, I always got the biggest kick out of playing a furry

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
And moisturizing and putting on the big furry costume

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
Haven't gotten there yet

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
But it is pretty fun

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
Yes, I'm a furry

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
Virtually

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
But it's nice to be able to do

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
The photography stuff

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
And Frank

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
Even in the main story mission

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
Which I'll probably go back to that

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
It's still pretty funny

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
Because the dialogue

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
And stuff's a little bit different

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
But a lot of the stuff that happens in the game

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
Is similar

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
It'll be interesting to see how the game plays out

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
So I'd recommend picking up

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
Especially since it's not even a full price game

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
It's just 40 bucks

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
Only?

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
It's like Dead Rising 2

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
But better

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
It's priced where most games ought to be in my opinion

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
But anyway

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
Definitely worth picking up

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
That's pretty much all I've played this week

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
Alright

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
Well hey, let's go to my game of the week

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
No I'm sorry

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
One last thing

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
Burnout Crash played that a little bit

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
And that's actually pretty fun

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
Despite the fact that I really hated the idea of a top down burnout

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
But it's actually a pretty fun game

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
Alright, you done?

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
I'm done

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
You sure?

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
So I haven't played a whole lot of games

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
Especially this week

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
I already told you guys I've been busy as hell

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
Besides the Disneyland games

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
I gotta go to Flynn's Arcade because Electronico is back

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
And play some classic games there

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
They didn't mix them up a little bit

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
I noticed some games were gone

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
But I play stuff like Frogger that's always there

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
And I also, you know, of course

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
Midway Mania

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
Which is a lot of fun

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
Came back and I've played, of course, a lot of Warcraft this week

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
As far as other games

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
That are not things I've already talked about on the show before

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
I took an opportunity

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
Since we were just talking about game pricing

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
I took an opportunity to pick up the latest

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
Humble Bundle

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
And if you didn't know

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
There is the Humble Frozen Synapse Bundle

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
Going on right now

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
And that is where you basically pay

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
What you want for the game Frozen Synapse

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
And it comes with

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
The game Spacechem as well

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
And if you're not familiar with Humble Bundle

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
They just had one of these

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
Not even a month or two ago

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
Because I remember that's how I got VVVVV

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
Was in one of these Humble Bundles

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
It's a very interesting

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
New way to price

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
Games

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
Where people can kind of pay what they want

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
And these games are not necessarily

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
New, but

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
They're, you know

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
Good games

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
And I think something a lot of people

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
May not have given another look

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
If they didn't have this whole pay what you want thing going on

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
And I think they're making pretty good money

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
Off of it and a chunk of it goes to charity

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
Which I think is great

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
And it's not just Spacechem either

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
If, well hold on I want to put this out

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
So if you spend more than the average

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
Which right now is $4.75

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
You get some other games as well

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
You get Shadow Grounds

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
You get Shadow Grounds Survivor

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
I think these other games were

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
Only with pre-order

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
I don't think you get them anymore

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
You get the game Trauma now too I think is thrown in there

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
And the one other game I want to mention

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
Because this is the one I played, Trine

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
Was in the bundle as well

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
I think Trine was on Xbox Live Arcade

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
I overlooked it, I never played it

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
So I'm playing it now on PC for the first time

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
Because I paid more than the average so I could check it out

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
It's pretty cool, I like it

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
When I was reading the description of it

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
I didn't quite understand it

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
But now that I'm playing it I'm like oh okay

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
So it's like a puzzle game

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
But you can automatically switch between a warrior type

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
A thief type and a wizard type

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
But when I say a puzzle game

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
I'm talking like a side scroller

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
So it's like Mario-esque I guess you want to say

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
But when you switch to the wizard

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
The warrior can draw blocks or he can levitate blocks

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
The thief has a long range attack

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
And can use a grappling hook

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
The warrior has a short range attack

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
And can use a shield

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
And you literally hit one button to switch between

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
Because the story kind of goes that all three of them

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
Find this magical item

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
That they get attached to

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
Because usually the thief and the warrior

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
Would not be getting along

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
And the mage and the thief would be having this weird

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
Thing going on

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
So the item binds them all together

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
And so now their souls are all shared or whatever

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
So they're going on this adventure to remedy that

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
And find treasure along the way

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
So that's basically the premise of the game

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
So you hit one button to switch between all these different types

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
So I think it's cool

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
And the other thing I love about these Humble Bundles

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
Is that they come with a key

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
So you can play them in Steam

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
So you buy the thing loaded in Steam

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
Now you have all the Steam achievements

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
People know what I'm playing

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
Can compete against me and all that good stuff

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
So

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
For the low low price of whatever

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
It's great

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
But again I would recommend you

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
Not be totally cheap

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
Spend let's just say five bucks at least

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
And get the other games as well

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
And if you're having a good week give them ten

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
It's a good cause

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
Or whatever you think these games are worth

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
So yeah that's at HumbleBundle.com

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
And trying alone was worth it

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
I gotta admit I tried

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
I was gifted a copy of Frozen Synapse

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
About two weeks ago

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
And Steam was having

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
A buy one get one free sale

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
Where people could give the codes to other people

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
And somebody was kind enough to give me their code for Frozen Synapse

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
I gotta admit

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
I didn't get it at all

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
I think I just need to try again

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
Sometimes you have to be in the right mindset

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
Have you guys ever had that?

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
You have to just be in the right mindset to enjoy a game

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
Sometimes you'll sit down and play it once

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
And you're like I don't get it

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
But then you go back a month later and play it again

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
And you're like oh man what was I missing

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
Which is why I don't think I ever reviewed it on the show

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
Cause I knew I wasn't really prepared to talk about it

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
Oh did Dark Soccer just buy the HumbleBundle?

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
Yes it did

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
Alright

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
I think you'll like trying

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
I'm not gonna buy this one because I haven't even played through more than one game

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
Out of the last bundle I bought

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
But didn't you play VVVVV until you beat it?

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
Yes

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
Until I beat it but not 100%

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
Because I still have one more

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
Shiny object to get

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
And I just want to rip my hair out

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
If I'm supposed to get that

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
It's annoying

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
I mean I get it

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
It's supposed to be hard

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
But I don't want to play it anymore

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
Because it's so hard

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
I'm not gonna come back to it

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
Cause I know what happens if I get it

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
It just flips the damn game upside down

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
Spoiler

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
And you play the same thing again

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
No it's still the same fucking game because you flip up and down

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
It's not like Castlevania

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
I get what you're saying

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
But up until you get to that point

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
It's an amazing game and the music is amazing

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
No it's an amazing game I love it

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
It's such a simple concept

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
It's just like

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
I know alright alright

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
But anyway I think

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
You should play Trion on 360

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
Cause I think a lot of people may have already played it

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
I would say that alone makes the set worth it

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
But you know

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
Check it out

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
Frozen Synapse I think is a bit more of a strategy game

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
Also comes with soundtracks in the editor

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
I haven't even picked that up

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
See you know what I just picked up my steam code

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
And went to town

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
Yeah

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
There you go

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
Salacious Pop is reminding me in our chatroom

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
Trion is also gorgeous

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
I'm doing this in the name of Orange Jones Radio

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
Even though I just put 10 bucks

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
Well still

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
Let's see

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
Trion is very gorgeous at least on the PC

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
I haven't seen it on 360 so I can't compare

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
But it is a very good looking game

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
Very cartoony lush lighting effects

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
It is a really good looking game

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
And very smooth on my computer

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
And I'm playing it in like 1680 by 1050

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
Widescreen

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
In high quality so

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
It's great

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
Yeah actually Salacious Pop may not even know

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
I didn't even have the graphics on their highest setting

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
I had it on high not very high

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
So maybe I'll have to try again later with the very high

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
So anyway that's pretty much my gaming week

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
So I think we will move on

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
To gaming news and talk about all that

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
With you guys in our chatroom

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
I guess I can quickly mention once again

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
Please follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash o-l-r

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
We also have a Facebook at facebook.com

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
Slash orange launch radio

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
This is also the part of the show where I will mention

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
Any housekeeping like upcoming shows that we're missing

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
And what have you

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
I'm stuck for the rest of the year

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
I don't see myself missing any shows

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
You know something unforeseen may always come up

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
I'm missing one in a few weeks

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
That's right Dark Soccer you are leaving for a week at the end of the month right?

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
I will be gone on the 23rd

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
So hopefully we'll have a guest host

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
Just like you guys had Dan here when I wasn't here

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
And we'll move on

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
Alright let's get into some gaming news

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
Loki start us off what's up

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
So PlayStation 2 games

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
As we've kind of thought for a while

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
Are going digital

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
In this new only on PlayStation Network campaign

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
They're going to be doing

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
Every Tuesday this month

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
They're going to have a new

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
Exclusive selection of rare

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
Classic games

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
God Hand, Grim Grimoire, Maximo

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
And Odin Sphere

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
And Ring of Red

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
Um

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
And I guess you know of course they

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
They're old PlayStation 2 games

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
They've done nothing to them no updates

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
Or whatsoever they just play now

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
On the PlayStation 3

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
And um

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
I guess um

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
PlayStation Plus members get them at

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
A 20% off discount

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
During the launch week

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
And if you spend more than $60

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
In October you'll get a $10

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
Credit for November

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
So um

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
Interesting

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
I guess they're saying there's also

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
A lineup of PlayStation Network exclusives

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
Now these aren't necessarily

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
These are actually not

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
PlayStation 2 games but

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
Euphoria and

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
Rock Hard that was actually

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
This week on the 4th

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
Next week on the 11th Sideway

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
New York on the 13th

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
Sodium Collection

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
If it's sodium

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
Might as well forget about it

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
18th Okabu

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
And Rocketbirds

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
And then on the 25th the expansion for

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
Infamous 2, Infamous Festival Blood

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
And Pixel Junk

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
Side Scroller

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
But all I gotta say is

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
Yeah thanks Sony you figured out a way

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
To play PlayStation 2 games on your PS

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
On your PS3 systems

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
But you don't do a free update

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
For everybody so they can I don't know take their old games

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
That they have and make everybody happy

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
Because they have backwards compatibility

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
No you decide to sell them on the marketplace

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
Figures

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
I'm trying to give Sony the

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
The

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
Whatever you call it I have a headache

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
Thank you the benefit of the doubt

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
I'm trying to give Sony the benefit of the doubt right now

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
And the whole

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
Backwards compatibility thing and I'm trying to think

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
Ok what is the reason why

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
You couldn't just put a disc into the PlayStation 3

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
It's because they had an entire PlayStation 2

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
In the PlayStation 3 originals

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
Right?

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
That emotion chip or whatever it was called in the PlayStation 2

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
Right?

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
Then eventually they got rid of it

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
Have they emulated that?

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
Well then they got rid of one of the chips

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
Remember that's why the backwards compatibility got cut a little bit

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
But then they also were able to cut the price by a hundred bucks

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
Yes and then they got rid of both chips

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
But now they have

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
Obviously an emulator because this is the way

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
That the PlayStation 1 games work

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
Because it's all emulation

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
So now they have an emulator that works

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
Or some way obviously that's able to do this stuff

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
And

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
They just

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
I know what you're doing

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
Here's my other question

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
Ok the whole benefit of the doubt thing

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
Is it maybe a situation similar to

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
Xbox 360 and original Xbox

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
Or maybe their emulator doesn't emulate

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
Everything and that's why they don't want to open it up

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
Because maybe it can't play the big big games

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
Like I mean you got a lot of neat games

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
In this original launch here

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
But let's be real it's not like you have

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
Your Final Fantasy X

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
Your Grand Theft Auto Vice City

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
Well yeah they're doing

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
Just rare

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
Classic games right now like God Hand

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
Like real niche stuff

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
That nobody maybe bought the first time

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
These I can guarantee aren't

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
All in the same engine

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
That's kind of how the Xbox backwards compatibility

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
Worked is they were trying to get

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
Everything to work correctly and you'd see

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
Like a big lot of games that were

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
All you know part of the same

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
You know engine game engine

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
They were running on that's why all these games

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
All of a sudden became available

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
That's why you got the Barbie Horse Adventures and you know some other

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
Good games

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
It

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
It's because they lost

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
It's because they lost a lot of money

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
When the Playstation Network went down

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
And they need to recoup that

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
That's why they're selling them

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
I did notice

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
That there was very little fanfare about this

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
You know what I mean like we've been building

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
Up to this for a long time remember about two years ago

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
There were the whole rumors about the Dreamcast

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
Things were going to be coming and

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
I don't know but those already have

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
No but there was something else about like

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
Around that same time like Playstation 2

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
Games were supposed to be opened up

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
Like there was a whole thing in that memo or whatever

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
Like I just seem to remember hearing that something with

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
Sega and it kind of never came to fruition

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
But we've been like waiting a long time

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
And thought there would be a big announcement

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
Like I thought there would be something at E3

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
Or even Tokyo Game Show about this

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
But no this just was like no yeah we're gonna

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
Just put these up in the marketplace enjoy

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
Well that's why you're seeing a lot of these older games that are

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
Very niche and stuff because these companies aren't gonna

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
Necessarily put out like these HD

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
Remakes or whatever of their old games

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
So like obviously you're not gonna

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
Find a Grand Theft Auto or something like that

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
Is part of this because

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
You know as we discussed last week of course

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
They're going to at some point up res all the

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
Grand Theft Auto games and put it out on a disc

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
I mean it's just

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
Stupid that if they don't I mean

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
Why wouldn't you especially if you know San Andreas

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
It would be easy all you would have to do

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
Is re-license the music in there

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
Obviously that would be a cost

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
And maybe re-record you wouldn't even

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
Necessarily have to re-record the

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
Audio in the game

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
Obviously you'd have to get the rights from all the

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
Voice actors and stuff like that but

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
You know if you put it in the

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
Rage Engine or something like that and they've already

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
Done that on the PC modders have already taken care of that

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
It could be done

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
And it's just getting all the

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
Rights and all the legal stuff taken

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
Care of but once they do that I mean

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
It's just gonna be amazing

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
Going to our chatroom for some comments at chat.orangelauncherady.com

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
SSJ100Matt

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
Says it's tactics like this that make

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
People want to hack their PlayStation 3

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
YYR says maybe

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
They're just doing software emulation

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
Wasn't there a PlayStation 3 model that did that already

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
Although it didn't support every game?

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
I remember that too wasn't it the Europe one?

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
Or maybe they had one here too but wasn't there

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
One overseas?

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
The old 80 gig systems that came

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
Out here a long time ago

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
80 and the 40

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
I think it was the 80 gig systems like the

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
Melger Solid one it was one of the first ones that

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
Supported just some of

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
The titles and not all of them

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
You mean like the one sitting in my front room?

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
Maybe. And then the 40 gig

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
Systems stopped supporting it and eventually

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
The 80 gig systems also stopped supporting it

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
But yeah it is

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
Software emulation so

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
Is the PlayStation 1 games

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
And in fact the PlayStation 1

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
Games you can take that

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
Emulator and basically dump any ISO

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
Into it and it'll work just fine

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
That's what they've done on hacked PSPs

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
Is they've taken that same emulator and you

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
Can run any PlayStation 1 game

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
And I'm guessing this is probably the same

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
Situation with the PlayStation 2 stuff

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
Is it's just an emulator that they have

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
And they've found a way to just

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
Basically they can dump any ISO in there

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
And done. They're ready to go

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
I don't know cause I haven't really seen anybody

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
Try to hack it apart yet but

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
I'm guessing that's probably what it is

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
Do you think they'll make a lot of money off this Loki?

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
Um yeah cause especially the games

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
That they're putting up like Odin Sphere you know

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
That's a game that was out there for just a

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
Little bit and it's a pretty awesome game

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
And a lot of people probably missed it and same with

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
God Hand. God Hand was another one that was just

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
You know clover game that's just

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
Amazing

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
Yeah I gotta admit there's some of those that I kinda

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
Want to check out too but thankfully

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
Alan has like a couple of these

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
Already so it's just like oh we just

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
Gotta hook up the PlayStation 2

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
It's sad though that they aren't even

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
Trying to like

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
Update these at all I mean they're not even

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
Smoothing out the graphics

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
Or whatever that you would get I think you can

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
Do that with the PlayStation 3

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
Well shit I haven't even tried to run

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
A PlayStation 2 game on my 20

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
Gig well 500 gig now

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
But um

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
I know you can do the smoothing stuff

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
Like kind of how you were able to with the

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
PlayStation 2 on PlayStation 1 games

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
You know it was a little bit better

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
Um

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
But yeah I mean it's just

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
It's kinda sad

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
That they're selling them and now I understand

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
Yeah I need to make money but

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
I think it would make a lot of people happy

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
If they you know brought that out there

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
So people can do that and then you can

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
Sell the games as well cause not everybody has

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
Got hand or Odin Sphere

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
And hell you can't

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
Buy new copies of that anymore so

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
That might be a good way to

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
You know drive sales and same with the PlayStation 1 games

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
PS3's are fully

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
Backwards compatible with PlayStation 1 games

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
And I'm pretty sure they sell a lot of PlayStation 1

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
Games on their network so

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
I don't understand why they don't do it

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
Um if I may rewind just a little bit

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
Sure of course

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
The game's plot that was a

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
Pre-order one

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
Um are including it when it's available

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
Oh okay

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
Nice

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
Woohoo

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
Good to know

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
Alright well let's move on with some other news

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
This is also about Sony and a comment

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
That they have made this week and it's about

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
The Vita which a lot of people are looking forward to

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
And I gotta say I'm one of them

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
I'm definitely picking up a Vita at launch

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
Loki you're getting one of these too right?

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
Maybe

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
What are you sitting on the fence with right now

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
That has more financial

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
Stuff it's financial

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
Is it? Okay

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
Well it is a financial investment I guess no matter how you look at it

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
I mean I guess it's financial for me too

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
But I just I have a real tendency to spend a lot of money

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
On stupid crap

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
The lineup is looking nice it's just

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
We'll see what they have at launch I mean

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
Alright well let's talk about a comment

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
That Jon Culler this week who's the director

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
Of hardware marketing mentioned in an interview with

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
Investor Palace

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
Quote we firmly believe that PlayStation Vita

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
Will supersede the mobile market when launched

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
And have grand ambitions for a product

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
That is really at the forefront of innovation

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
The mobile market in the US

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
Offers consumers extremely light gaming

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
Options

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
So in other words

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
They seem to think that

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
Despite the fact that the iPhone

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
Is out there with their mobile gaming and all that

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
That the Vita

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
Can kind of give mobile gaming

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
A run for its money

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
Even though it's not a phone

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
Yeah

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
Um

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
I don't know about that

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
I do like the fact that

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
They're opening up to developers

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
And the fact that it has controllers

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
I mean buttons

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
It's important and it's definitely

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
Something that's sorely missed on a lot of these

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
You know iPhone games and stuff and

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
The fact that it's gonna have

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
Still the touch sensor you could

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
Pretty much if you're a developer you could port this

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
Stuff over to the PlayStation

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
Or whatever

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
And you know if it does

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
End up turning out to be pretty viable

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
You could see a lot of stuff coming out of there

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
And yeah they could quickly catch up

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
Beating out Apple right away

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
I don't know about that

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
I mean cause they're not gonna sell more units

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
Than there are iPhones or iPods or whatever

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
iPads

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
Just like their two tablets I mean come on

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
Yeah those things are terrible looking

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
I mean come on

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
No

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
I

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
Well you know I'm still looking forward to the Vita

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
And I think the intricacy of the games

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
On here are not gonna be able to

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
I mean I will be

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
A step higher certainly than what you get

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
On the iPhone and so forth despite everything

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
That you know iPhone showed this week

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
But

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
I think the other big thing that sets this apart

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
Is just the fact that it's designed as a gaming system

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
First so therefore you have things like

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
I don't know tangible buttons

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
And sort of the features that gamers

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
Would want but of course

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
This whole comment like this you know

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
We're better than

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
The mobile games and so forth I think it just serves

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
As justification for them to charge way more money

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
For the games and how much weren't you saying the games

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
Were like 50 bucks on this thing right now

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
Yeah that's what the PSP games are

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
I just I couldn't I always thought

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
PSP games are

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
$40 now

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
But they're they used to be 50 bucks

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
I mean it's just now

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
You're not seeing a lot of games sold on there

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
But yeah there's still $50 games on the PSP

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
And I think that's a great price point

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
I mean assuming that stays there

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
And doesn't go any higher cause

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
I don't know I just

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
Don't think they should be but I like the fact though

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
That the system is gonna be very much like the original

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
PSP where it's a gaming system

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
But it does a lot of other shit

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
Right right and I think

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
That will be probably ultimately its greatest

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
Strength as well is that it's a great college

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
Kids system and I think that's

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
Probably where the PSP sold a lot too

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
So there you go

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
Alright well DarkSakura what do you got for us?

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
I have some stuff and it's more

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
Sony yay

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
Basically they've implied that

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
All the first party titles are going to use the online pass

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
Basically they're

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
Pulling an EA like the $10

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
Deal so they're

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
Saying that Uncharted 3 is gonna use

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
The online pass system

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
That was introduced earlier with Resistance 3

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
And saying that

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
Online pass will be incorporated into future Sony

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
Computer Entertainment Worldwide Studios

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
Games with online functionality

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
Let me say they're gonna

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
Announce more on it later

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
Well now a first party is on board I think it's time to

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
Just accept that this is now the norm

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
Yeah right? Pretty much

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
There's still some people that are

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
I think you'll see a lot more third parties do it

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
You're not gonna see Microsoft do it

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
They can't I mean that would just look good

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
Microsoft can't do it you're right I agree with you there

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
Unless they stop charging for gold

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
Which they're not gonna do

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
So it would be very interesting

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
If they try though

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
I can't wait for that episode

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
And Nintendo well you know

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
They don't even know online exists

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
What online? Exactly

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
That was funny you made a story

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
It's like you have to charge for an online pass

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
What? There's online? There's online?

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
So we can maintain our online system

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
What?

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
What online?

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
Well who knows?

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
There's still a lot of question marks

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
Like what does it do?

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
Well one of those huge question marks is

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
How's it gonna handle online?

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
And they have been purposefully quiet on it

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
Because they don't fucking know

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
They better know by June

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
Like crap

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
We have to do online as well

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
Our online system will be significant

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
Significantly bad

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
I told you at E3 right

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
When they brought the EA guy out on stage

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
I thought he was gonna come out to announce

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
The EA guy

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
That EA was gonna just do the online part of the Wii

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
Like I seriously thought

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
Cause they were talking about a partnership and stuff

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
And they mentioned like online games and stuff

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
And I thought oh they're just gonna let EA

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
Handle the online part of the Wii

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
That'll be what it is

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
No that wasn't what it is

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
That would be terrible if they did that

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
And that would be sad

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
Alright moving on Loki

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
So

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
It's kinda cool during the same time as

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
The Apple

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
And Vail of their new

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
Technology devices and stuff like that

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
There was this whole

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
Kind of like Flash

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
Adobe conference

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
Adobe Max conference going on

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
And some of the new things

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
That they're showing first off

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
Unreal Engine support for Flash 11

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
Which is kind of interesting

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
You're gonna actually have some really decent looking games now

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
Running in the Flash

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
Or even in your own

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
Web browser so

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
That's kinda cool

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
People are saying hey maybe

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
This could be a major transition in social gaming

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
No it won't

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
I'm afraid that's not gonna be the case

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
Cause you know what

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
Yes the technology may be out there

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
To do that

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
But doesn't necessarily mean that a company

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
Is going to do that seeing as they can develop a game

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
Much cheaper that doesn't necessarily

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
Need the Unreal 3 engine

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
But it's neat to see that

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
Hey someday we may be playing

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
Unreal Tournament

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
In our web browser

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
And then

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
Of course not to be outdone by that

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
Crytek also is

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
Investigating Flash for the

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
Cry engine and possibly

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
Doing some sort of cross platform

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
Solution including

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
Support with

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
A bunch of other

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
Systems. They're even saying maybe

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
Looking into iOS and Android that'd be kinda cool

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
I don't know if that'd be able to

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
Obviously not some of the phones

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
Out there like mine but

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
Very cool

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
And of course they're saying

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
Crytek Seal is hard

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
To work at. The first person shooter

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
Warface which is supposed to be coming out in

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
Asian regions

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
But

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
It might be pretty cool if they do some

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
Sort of easy

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
Cross platform solution you may see a lot of these

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
PC games being ported to

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
Many other devices other than just

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
Xbox 360 and PS3

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
In the near future

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
So

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
That's cool and it'll be interesting to see

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
If web browsers actually get

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
Enough technology where

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
They can support really good looking

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
Games that would be kind of interesting

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
Because then you wouldn't necessarily need

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
You know like

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
A tablet device or game

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
Console or whatever you just

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
Play the game. Well web based

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
Game also makes me think about

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
Facebook games and Google Plus

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
Games of which I wish more stuff was

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
There on Google Plus but whatever

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
You know and whether you love or hate

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
Facebook games you gotta think

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
If this technology is gonna be available

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
Soon like could you imagine if

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
Unreal was a Facebook game?

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
I don't know if that would be

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
I see the problem is

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
I just shot my friend DarkSakura

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
In the face! Click here

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
To post to your wall and try Unreal

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
Games now. The problem with that though is

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
I just don't see them

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
Doing like a casual game

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
Like that because once again you know Facebook

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
Kind of tends to

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
Skew towards casual gamers

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
And I don't really see

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
Unreal Tournament you know

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
Appealing to my mom or something

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
Unreal Engine shows up in really weird

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
Stuff. Yes that's true. Like you wouldn't expect

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
A game I completely neglected to mention

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
In my game week probably because I

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
Played it like three weeks ago

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
When I was on hiatus from the show

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
Was the Mortal Kombat collection

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
The classic Mortal Kombats

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
I downloaded that on Playstation Network

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
And played that a little bit

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
And I was surprised to see the powered by

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
Unreal technology logo at the beginning

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
I realized the new game is

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
But I was like well what the hell about the classic

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
Emulation needs the fucking Unreal

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
Engine? Like really?

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
The only thing I could possibly think of

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
Are the little like rotating

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
Images of the arcade cabinets

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
I'm like what?

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
Or maybe there's some maybe I just

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
Haven't seen it yet maybe there's like an unlockable demo

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
For the new one or something that shows up

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
But I was kind of surprised to see that

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
I was like okay I know

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
Mortal Kombat 3 and 2 and 1

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
Did not run on the Unreal Engine

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
No I'm pretty sure they did not

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
This is funny to me

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
So

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
Although if they somehow you know

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
Enabled it to where they took the old

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
MoCap stuff and made it into actual

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
3D models with the

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
MoCap license

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
You know likenesses and stuff

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
It would be very interesting to see something like that

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
It's like oh hey look it's classic Mortal Kombat

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
But we can turn it in any direction

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
And it's 3D

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
Some might pay for that

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
Tigerclaw in our chatroom at chat.orangetontrader.com says

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
An Unreal web based game is possible

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
Look at Quake Live for example

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
Well there's a good example Quake Live is a good time

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
So

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
I'd like to see more stuff like that

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
Certainly it would be very interesting

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
It would also be interesting to see what MMOs

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
That's another big thing that web browsers are used for

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
Some of those free MMOs

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
Although the quality of some of those is

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
Questionable

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
This could take a lot of that to the next level

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
It would be interesting to see what happens

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
Dear Square Enix

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
Final Fantasy XIV

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
Do Square Enix already uses Unreal Engine

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
For some of their projects?

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
Well I know they used it for one game that no one ever bought

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
It was Infinite Undiscovery right?

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
Haven't they used it on Unreal Engine?

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
Infinite Undiscovery was the other one that came out around the same time

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
Yes that no one bought

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
I can't remember the name of it

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
Last Remnant

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
No one bought it

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
No I remember that because I think Alan bought it

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
Or he had it

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
Or played it or something

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
I thought there was another

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
Final Fantasy XIII uses Unreal

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
Oh really?

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
I think it does

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
Hmm

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
You know what I miss?

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
That was pretty cool

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
What? What are you talking about?

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
Do you remember the Square Enix game The Bouncer?

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
I remember that game

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
I remember a brawler called Ergeist

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
But I don't remember

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
Oh Ergeist was awesome

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
That's a game you need a sequel for right there

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
The Bouncer was an early PS2 title

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
Yeah it was actually pretty awesome

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
Were they all Final Fantasy X characters?

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
Except they worked in a bar?

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
As bouncers

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
As bouncers

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
It was a weird game

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
It was awesome

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
Alright

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
I tried to look at the Wikipedia article for Final Fantasy XIII

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
When I need to do research quickly

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
There's always Wikipedia

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
Where people have done the research for me

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
I tried to do a search on Unreal and didn't find it

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
But I thought I saw that logo in the beginning of the game

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
Or heard something about it

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
Speaking of Final Fantasy

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
It's not on our show roll tonight

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
Since I brought up XIII it just triggered it for me

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
Did you guys see the full trailer for XIII Versus?

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
At the web this week?

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
It looks hot

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
It looks very hot

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
It's Final Fantasy, but I have no idea why it's XIII

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
I know it's set in the same universe

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
But I didn't see any of the characters

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
Not really, I thought it was supposed to set more of a real

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
I don't know what the hell it has to do with XIII

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
But whatever

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
There will probably be some obscure little thing when you actually play the game

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
But the action, the battles

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
Kind of look like Kingdom Hearts

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
With the hit points showing up on the screen

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
It looks sweet actually

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
We're going to do an awesome radio moment here

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
And I'm going to pull up the trailer here in studio

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
And I'll post this in chat so you guys can see this too

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
For those of you that are on the podcast feed

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
I'll have DarkSakura posted to our Tumblr

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
At orangeloungeradio.tumblr.com

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
Are you not an IRC DarkSakura?

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
I am an IRC

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
I meant like privately so I can copy the URL

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
Oh yeah I will

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
As soon as I pull it up here

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
I remember, is this it? No this isn't the right one

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
Where did I see that trailer?

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
Somebody in chat will probably

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
Hello Tigerclaw

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
Right?

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
Tigerclaw should have posted it by now

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
Gameplay trailer

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
Maybe it's

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
No that's Eidos, that's Deus Ex

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
Who the hell posted this

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
And I watched it the other day

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
I think somebody had posted it on Facebook

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
Oh so in other news

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
No kidding

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
I have made Fantastic Nut Bread

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
It was quite delicious

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
It has no flour

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
I made it with no flour

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
It's made with almond meal

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
You're not trying to find anything on the new Facebook by the way

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
Your mission

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
If you choose to accept it

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
Find something on Facebook

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
There's a plugin for Chrome that makes it run like the old version

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
Yes

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
The problem is I don't want to use Chrome

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
But yeah

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
Oh yeah that's right

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
They did have the last remnant on PC

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
Anyway

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
Well Rob's looking that up

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
I found one

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
But it's not the right one

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
They did a flip of it

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
I'm trying to see if I can find the

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
Holy crap

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
I'm trying to see if I can find the actual gameplay parts

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
Oh wait

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
This was uploaded in like 2009

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
This isn't even right

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
Gosh darn it

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
Tigerclaw find it for us

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
I will keep looking for it

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
Sorry guys

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
Terrible radio

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
But I know I saw it

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
Shoot the next story is mine

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
I can't look for it while I talk about this story

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
So I'll get through this quickly

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
Although maybe not because this is actually pretty big news

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
Microsoft has talked a little bit this week

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
About some of the TV updates

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
For the Xbox 360

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
We knew after E3 that they were going to be doing this

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
They were going to be bringing more television to the 360

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
But we didn't really know how

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
Well it turns out

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
They've announced some partnerships

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
And some of those include HBO

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
And HBO Go, Comcast, Syfy

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
And Verizon

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
I guess there was an earlier list that had leaked

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
And it turns out a lot of that seems to be correct

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
They did publish a full list of the

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
Partners that will be in the fall dashboard update

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
Comcast went so far

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
As to make a blog post talking about

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
Using the partnership with Microsoft to

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
Offer Xfinity content

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
So it sounds like, and this is

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
Of direct relevance to me because

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
I have Comcast at home living where I live

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
It sounds like

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
That you will be able to

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
Use the on demand system

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
In Comcast, you can use that

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
In

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
The 360 now

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
But see that's the thing

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
I was hoping it would be more original stuff

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
And not necessarily just everything that's on

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
Demand, because if I want to watch on demand

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
I can hit one

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
Button on my remote and I get on demand

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
Content, I don't need to necessarily

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
You know, unless

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
Unless you're able to like say

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
Take your console to

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
Friends house or something like that and then you can

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
Access all your on demand content

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
That way

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
I don't know, I was just hoping for more

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
Original stuff, like an alternative

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
That me having to have cable

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
You know what I mean?

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
Bajillion alternatives out there anyway

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
So I mean

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
This is just adding to the pile

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
So

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
What I'm also curious of is that if

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
They're announcing all these other partnerships

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
The weird thing is though, doesn't HBO want to

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
Charge you 10 bucks for their service and then

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
These other, well HBO I don't think you can

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
Access unless you have HBO, it's kind of like

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
How Xfinity

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
And stuff, you can't access HBO

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
On demand stuff unless you have HBO

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
And isn't it the same with like

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
A mobile app, like you can't access

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
Mobile CNN video unless you have like

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
Comcast or something? Yeah, see so

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
That's why I was just kind of like

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
Eh, don't really care, I mean cause

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
Well, I gotta say though, I do like

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
The idea that you know, because the HBO

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
Stuff isn't on Netflix and it's not really on

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
Demand either, I like that it'll kind of be

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
All in one place, like I get what you're

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
Saying with the one button on the remote, but

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
You know, if the Xbox 360 is gonna be this

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
All in one entertainment device, it'd be nice

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
If you can DVR stuff, that'd be pretty awesome

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
If you don't want to pay for DVR

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
I don't think that's gonna

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
Happen, but you know

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
Also, it looks like

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
AT&T U-verse is gonna

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
Require Xbox Live Gold

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
Starting in November, that was a note

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
That was sent by the AT&T folks

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
To their customers, which I'm assuming

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
Is lining it up with everything else here, right?

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
The TV service will actually require Xbox Live Gold

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
All of them

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
But before

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
Their boxes or whatever

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
Through AT&T U-verse, because some of them

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
Still already have that

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
You know, they do not require

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
Gold

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
But they will now come November

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
That might make some people a little bit upset

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
But not AT&T customers, though

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
Nope

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
Because they're giving them a $60 credit

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
Right, so yes, they give

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
A $60 credit

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
To existing AT&T U-verse customers

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
For Xbox 360 customers

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
Now is that each year or just one year?

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
I think it's just one time, probably

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
That would make sense

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
I want Comcast to give me a $60 credit

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
Alright, so

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
Who found this? Loki found this

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
Did you find this with somebody's help in chat?

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
Nope, I searched Final Fantasy 13

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
Versus sort by date

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
Alright, well good job

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
Here's what the gameplay looks like in the game

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
So you can kind of see

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
There's some live action

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
Things that happen

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
The final round still kind of looks

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
13-ish, but there's a lot of life

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
So here's some battle

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
What's he doing in New York?

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
Right, it's kind of Kingdom Hearts-ish

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
But with that very

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
Final Fantasy 7

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
Or 7 slash 13

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
Environment, you know what I mean

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
The swirly bits look like 12

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
Yeah, I can see that

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
I can see a little bit of 12 here, too

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
But I like this, too

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
Did you notice those little pictures in the corner

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
That the people are actually

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
Live rendering what the people are doing

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
That's pretty cool

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
Here, watch your safety

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
It's cool, yeah, it's awesome

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
It's not just a static picture, it's what they're doing

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
That's like that add-on I use in WoW

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
It's like X-Pearl

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
Yeah, it's X-Pearl

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
Final Fantasy X-Pearl

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
So there you go, there's what your Final Fantasy looks like

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
Is that Cloud?

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
It's Cloud with a gun

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
Send me that and I'll put it on our

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
Tumble bubble blubber

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
There it is for the chatters

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
Because I know us watching trailers isn't always the best radio

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
But there you go, now you have a place you can go look it up

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
If you haven't already seen it

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
So, I guess let's move on

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
With some other gaming news

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
Dark Sakura

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
Complete with an ad by Queen Latifah

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
Sorry, Dark Sakura, I've got to distract you from the trailer

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
Well, how about some Skyward Sword characters

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
There's actually

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
A few spoilers

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
And you'll hear it here first

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
So there is

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
Link and Zelda

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
Are childhood friends

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
And have a special bond

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
There is a bully

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
At Link's school named Groose

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
G-R-O-O-S-E

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
And there is

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
A person named Fe

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
Who is the spirit

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
Don't worry, Link, it gets better

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
Spirit of the Goddess Sword

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
And there is

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
Gaepora

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
Who is

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
Zelda's father

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
And the headmaster of Link's school

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
So

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
There is another place in the game called

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
Faron Woods

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
And you start off the game in a place called

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
Skyloft

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
And you can go to Skyview Temple

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
Where Zelda was kidnapped and is being held

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
Again, yay

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
As far as attacks

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
That are in there, there's holding down the A button

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
Makes Link run faster and gives him acrobatic

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
Abilities, he can run up

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
Walls

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
I guess like he's Spider-Man or some shit

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
Or the fucking

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
Prince of Persia

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
He can grab onto cliffs

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
But that uses Link's stamina

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
But you can replenish his stamina over time

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
There's a spin attack that gives you stamina

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
And when your stamina is depleted

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
You go slowly

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
You become old man Link

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
And that's all I'm going to talk about it

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
Although

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
There is one interesting thing that's in there

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
You can douse

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
You know what dousing is right?

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
You know the old thing where people would have

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
The forked stick and look for water

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
That's dousing

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
I thought there was another name for that

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
A diving rod?

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
Divining rod

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
Because I've known

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
Hippy people that do like

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
Dowsing on your aura and stuff

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
I know hippies

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
Rama in our chat room says

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
Link in high school, what is this? Saved by the Triforce?

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
But anyway

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
Tiffany Amber Thiessen will be playing

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
The part of Zelda

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
But for dousing basically you hold out

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
The sword and point it in the direction of the target

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
And it will flash

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
So basically it's to lead you in the right direction

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
It's kind of

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
Hmm

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
Shadow Colossus did it first

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
So

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
Bunny did it back in the

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
40's

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
Simpsons did it

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
I'm done

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
Well just for

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
Rama

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
Since Rama brought it up

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
I was going to play this for you

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
This was Dark Sakura's reaction

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
To actually hearing about the Zelda game

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Yes I can

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
I'm so excited

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
I'm so excited

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
I'm so

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Scared

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
You know I never watched that show for a reason

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
That was the infamous

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
Caffeine Pills episode

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
I understand

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
But I never

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
Watched that show because I can't watch a show with people

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
Acting stupid

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
Seriously that's why I don't watch Seinfeld

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
But yet you went with us to watch Showgirls

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
Because that's different

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
They weren't being stupid to be funny

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
It was funny without trying to be funny

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
Let's travel around the world

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
And check out what's going to be coming to a game store

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
Near you

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
Saved by the bell collection on blu-ray maybe?

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
I don't know

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
That's not a game

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
Thank god

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
That'd be terrible

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
Anything saved by the bell in the game would be terrible

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
Unless you had to murder all of them

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
In which case that could be cool

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
So this week actually some pretty cool stuff

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
As I mentioned on Playstation 3

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
And Xbox 360

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
Re-release

If you will of Dead Rising

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
But Dead Rising 2 off the record

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Coming out this week on both systems

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
As well

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
Some other things you can look forward to

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
Power Up Heroes

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
That is kind of

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
A superhero

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
Kinect game that's coming out

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
Red Dead Redemption Game of the Year edition

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
Definitely a good buy if you haven't

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
Picked it up yet

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
Both the regular and undead nightmare stuff

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
Plus all the download content for 50 bucks

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
That's on Playstation 3 and Xbox 360

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
Never coming to PC according to

That's on Nintendo DS this week

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
Wipeout 2 based on the

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
TV show on 3DS

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
Playstation 3, Xbox 360

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
And the Wii and you can expect

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
Kinect support there

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
Mahjong Cubed for the 3DS

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
Hidden on the 3DS

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
Kind of an augmented reality

Ghost hunting game

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000

On the 3DS this week

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
Kind of a port of the old one

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
As we've been talking a little bit about

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
This game

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
Talking some of the tracks coming out

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
Very surprisingly there's actually some really good

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
Tracks in here. Dance Dance Revolution 2

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000

Bundles $50

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
Worth checking out if you're interested in some of the new

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
Arcade songs cause they're in the game

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
And Sesame Street

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
Once Upon a Monster

That's coming out on Xbox 360

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000

There's a lot of fucking games this week

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Lots of games

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
Jonah Luma Rugby Challenge on 360

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
Yet another rugby game exclusive to

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
GameStop for some reason

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
And uh

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
1001 Touch Games on

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
Nintendo DS, Might and Magic Heroes

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
Why on earth would you make your game exclusive to GameStop?

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
Rugby games

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
They did that, yeah

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
It's weird. The last rugby game that came out

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
People like rugby? I understand that but

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
People don't like GameStop and I don't want to go

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
There to get my rugby game

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
I mean, let's be real. I'm not gonna buy it

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
505 did it with their last rugby game that came out

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
At the beginning of September and they made it

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
Yeah, nobody has explained to me

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
What the fucking connection between GameStop and

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
Rugby is

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
I have no clue. No idea

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
1001 Touch Games

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
For the DS, Might and Magic Heroes

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
6 on PC

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
And god a game

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
I hope tanks so god damn bad

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
Skylanders Spyro's Adventure

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
On Playstation 3, Xbox 360

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
Wii, 3DS and PC

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
May it burn in hell

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
And for the new listeners

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
Why do you want this game to fail?

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
It's because it's a pain in the ass

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
It's Activision's adventure into

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
Toys and games

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
And if you think download content is bad

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
And you think oh Activision they're gonna

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
Whore out download content

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
You ain't seeing shit with

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
Skylanders

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
My god, they have 30 different

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
Toys you can buy

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
Little figurines, and I hardly even call them toys

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
They do not move whatsoever

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
They're statues, they're basically

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
Download content, they cost $8 each

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
Cause they're trying to get kids

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
To buy the shit

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
And you know how twisted this is?

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
They got in bed with Toys R Us

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
So that they can get on their top

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
Hot 15 games

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
Or Hot 15 toys list

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
Which they did, and they have an exclusive pack

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
Over at Toys R Us, a 3 pack of their figures

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
Yeah, cause that hot

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
Hot games list, yeah that's not manipulated

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
At all to get people to buy shit

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
Right

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
So, hope it tanks

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
So don't follow the hot games list

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
Yes, don't follow it, and it's not

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
It's rigged, it's not Spyro

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
Spyro, it's not what it used to be

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
Shenanigans, it's just like us getting nominated

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
For a podcast award, shenanigans

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
It's just, it's really not worth it

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
I mean seriously, it's $70

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
To buy this game, on a 3DS

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
By the way, it's $70 for the 3DS

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
Wow, oh my god

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
And $70 on every other platform except PC

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
Which is $60

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
Do you really want to spend $70 for a happy square game?

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
Will the little toys do my laundry?

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
Nope, they do nothing, they do not move at all

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
Alright, I'm just saying

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
This will be the next

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
Tony Hawk ride game

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
I mean, it's

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
I will be surprised if this takes off

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
Alright, we'll see what happens

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
If that's it for your releases, then let's go to Japan

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
And check out what's coming out in Japan

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
On the Xbox 360 this week in Japan

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
Dead Rising 2 off the record

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
Forza Motorsport 4 gets its release in Japan

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
As well as Ace Combat, Assault Horizon

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
Call of Juarez, the Cartel

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
Halo Reach gets a price reduction

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
In the Platinum Collection in Japan this week

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
And Connectimals gets a release

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
Is this the one that has bears in it?

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
Plus bears, yeah

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
It's Connectimals

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
Yes, that's right

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
Connectimals and bears

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
By the way, when I was at Disneyland

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
I went in the Innovations building

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
They have a lot of Kinect stuff there

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
In the Innovations building

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
You can play like Child of Eden and stuff

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
But they have a little room, and I thought this was neat

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
They had a little room set up for kids

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
And they were actually people working for Disney

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
Helping these kids play Connectimals

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
And they had it on a giant TV

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
I'm talking like the size of the wall in this house

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
They had a giant TV playing Connectimals

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
My friend Victoria played it for a little bit

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
It was kind of fun

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
It's nice to see some love in the Innovations building

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
I thought it was closed

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
I think it kind of closes

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
It's been remodeled since the last time

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
I was there, and you don't

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
Enter the same way you used to

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
There's no little show when you go in

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
They figured that was kind of dry

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
Well, we made it a point

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
We said we each need to do something we've never

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
Done at Disneyland before, and my friend Victoria

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
Had never been to the Innovations building

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
So we went in

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
And believe it or not, there's some neat stuff in there

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
They still have some Microsoft Surfaces

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
Remember those? The tables?

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
Those were fun

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
So what did you not do before Disneyland?

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
What did I not do before that we did?

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
I don't remember

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
Did you go on the boat?

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
I think there was a ride we went on

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
That I just hadn't been on before

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
For whatever reason

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
I can't remember off the top of my head

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
Did you sneak onto the PeopleMover?

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
We went to the Carnation Plaza grounds

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
And we ate lunch there

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
I don't think that was the official thing

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
But we did eat our lunch there

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
Because that's going away because they're making the new

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
Tangled area there

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
And the Fantasyland expansion

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
We just sat and ate and enjoyed it

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
For the last time

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
I liked where we ate last time

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
In New Orleans Square

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
That was great

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
Carnation Plaza Gardens

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
It's been there since the 50s

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
And it's where they used to do some live shows

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
And events but now it's like

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
Hardly anybody's there and it's right smack in the middle

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
That's another little restaurant that's at the end of Main Street isn't it?

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
There's no restaurant there anymore

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
I mean but it was a restaurant at the end of Main Street

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
That's across from where the buffet is

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
On the opposite side

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
Yes it is

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
So you can name something in Disneyland and I can pretty much figure out where it is

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
Alright

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
Moving on to

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
I want to make sure

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
I caught everything on the 360

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
Let me go on to the

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
PlayStation 3

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
Which this week will get

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
Ace Combat, Assault Horizon, Dead Rising 2

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
Off the record

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
As well as Call of Juarez, the Cartel

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
And Medal of Honor gets a price reduction going into the Best Hits series

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
And that is again PlayStation 3

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
In Japan

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
Trying to quickly look and see if there's anything

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
On 3DS this week

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
Or

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
The Wii even

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
Let's see the 3DS

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
Nope not this week

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
There's a game called Izito 3D

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
That's it

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
But the Misty Pink 3DS has come out next week

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
And I know Loki already has his preordered

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
On the Wii though Just Dance Wii

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
Gets a Japanese release this week

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
I guess that's notable

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
Especially for music game fans

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
I don't know if the song list has been localized or what have you

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
You know I was going to mention something real quick

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
Cause I noticed this last night when I was checking

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
Dead Rising 2 had any download content

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
Just Dance 3

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
What they have is they have it where you can download trials

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
So you can check out the songs before you buy them

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
I think that's a great idea

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
And I know they do that with Rock Band

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
But some other music games do not

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
So yeah

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
Just Dance on the Wii makes its way to Japan this week

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
And that's it for Japanese releases

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
How about

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
Overseas Dark Soccer the other way

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
Well in Europe we have

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
Well I just said the UK we have

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
Dragon's Age 2 Mark of the Assassin

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
Coming out on the 11th

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
On the 12th Guardian Heroes for Xbox 360

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
Which is awesome

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
Orcs Must Die which is the best name ever

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
And then on the 14th we have

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
Ace Combat Assault Horizon Dead Rising 2

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
Off the record

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
Forza Motorsport 4

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
Might and Magic Heroes 6

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
PES 2012

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
Renegade Ops

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
Sesame Street Once Upon a Monster

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
Spiderman Edge of Time

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
And World Rally Championship 2

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
Bleh

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
Alright

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
Well let's move on

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
With a couple more news stories

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
And then we'll let Dark Sakura have at the classic

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
Game of the Week

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
By the way I just gotta say

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
Part B tonight's gonna be action packed

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
Usually all the good stuff's in Part A

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
But there's like some awesome stuff coming for Part B

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
So I'm just saying for those of you that sometimes

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
Want to tune out halfway through

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
You wanna stick around tonight

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
So I'll tell you why in just a minute

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
So they announced some cool

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
Stuff this week during the

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
Apple press conference

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
Of course the new thing being the iPhone 4S

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
Sorry not iPhone 5

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
But you know what? It's just a name

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
It's seriously just a name

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
Everyone's like, man I'm so bummed they didn't announce

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
The iPhone 5, it's a fucking new

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
iPhone, who cares if they call it

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
iPhone 5, iPhone

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
Fart, it's still a goddamn iPhone

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
I'd buy an iPhone fart

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
Plus the thing that gets me

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
Is that, well there was the 3G

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
And the 3GS and people

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
Didn't get their panties and a bunch about that

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
And quite frankly I'm kinda

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
Glad they're not putting out the iPhone 5 now

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
Because I'm still under contract on the 4

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
I'm not upgrade eligible until January

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
So if there was like that awesome

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
Of a phone coming I would be kind of upset

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
I get to upgrade next month

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
Do you? Yeah. So you can get a 4S

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
Yeah. Alright do you think you'll get one?

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
Yeah. Okay. Oh the dance continue

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
Are you getting excited about Siri?

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
Siri. Explain to me the meaning of life

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
I really don't give a shit about Siri but I'll try it

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
Yeah. So I mean

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
You can try it now. I've read about

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
The Siri pranking on the internet

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
Like some good phrases that people have thought

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
Up to yell at like

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
When your friend activates Siri like things

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
That you would yell

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
Siri text my mom that I'm gay

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
Send

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
You know just prank things to uh

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
Send. That's gonna be a

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
Brand new era of damn you

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
Autocorrect. Yes. Yes.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
It will be. Oh my gosh. Damn you Siri.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
Michelle. Michelle are you listening? Michelle you better

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
Get that thing registered right now

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
Damn you Siri. Damn you Siri

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
Dot com

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
Alright

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
Um

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
So anyways iPhone 4S is

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
Coming October 14th

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
It adds a brand new processor the A5

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
Processor which is apparently

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
Dual core. Up to seven

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
Times the graphics capability

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
And uh enhanced

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
You know camera

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
More RAM

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
All sorts of new features

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
Siri of course as you mentioned

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
Um

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
You know new antenna design

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
GCM or GSM

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
And CDMA radios in the device

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
It's gonna be

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
Available in three different

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
Flavors if you will. 16 gigabyte

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
32 gigabyte and 64 gigabyte

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
Ranging from 199

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
And of course

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
In white or black

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
And of course they're dropping the iPhone 4 down

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
To $99 for the 8

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
Gig model and the 3GS

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
Will apparently be free

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
If you know you have

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
With a plan obviously

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
And that would be the 8 gigabyte model

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
As well

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
Some other fun stuff

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
Of course iOS 5 is coming October 12th

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
And with that they're gonna be bringing

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
iCloud and Airplay

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
To gaming

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
So you'll be able to

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
Play with multiple devices streaming to TVs

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
In fact one of the first games

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
To support that Real Racing 2

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
Will allow you to stream I believe

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
Up to four devices to your TV

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
And do split screen gaming

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
With you know it being on your iPhone

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
I had no idea that this was a feature

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
In it. Did they even talk about this at the press conference?

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
Uh I think they did

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
I slept through it

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
Well I was reading live blogs too

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
Kinda just on my break look

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
And it was like you know showing

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
Was it you can run

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
It of course on your iPhone 4s

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
Or on your iPad 2

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
And stream wirelessly

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
Because before they had it where you can link it up to your TV

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
But you have to hook up an HDMI cable

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
And stuff so

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
And of course along with that you know since the

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
Phone can

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
Have a little bit more horsepower

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
Infinity Blade 2 is coming to

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
And since Apple is the king

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
Of handheld gaming as so they claim

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
This week which is

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
You know the way they spin the numbers

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
Is interesting and I don't doubt it at all

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
But it's uh it's

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
It's interesting

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
Infinity Blade 2 becoming the iOS

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
December 1st of course

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
Is gonna look extra pretty on the 4s

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
But it will be I believe compatible with

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
Other devices as well

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
Of course why would you shut out your other

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
Exactly

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
So yeah very

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
Interesting though

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
Well I want to go back to Siri for a minute

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
Because I forgot about this little commercial I had seen

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
On Facebook and so far that was floating

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
Around the internet and then Tiger Cloud just linked it in

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
Chat and this does have to do with

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
Gaming a little bit this is a commercial

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
For the new Siri feature

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
On the iPhone 4s take a listen

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:45.000
Read me the message

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
New message from Kay bad news

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
Combustible lemons failed

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
And you meet us at 10

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
Reply definitely I'll see you there

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
Play my running mix

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
Oh joy

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
What's the traffic like around here

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
The traffic will be slow and meaningless

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
Just like your sad little life

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
Text my wife I'm gonna be 30 minutes late

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
She won't mind she doesn't really love you anyway

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
Is it going to be chilly in San Francisco this weekend?

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
Not too cold

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
Your few extra pounds should be suitable insulation

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
To keep you warm

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
What about Napa Valley

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
I hear it's beautiful there

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
Unlike you

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
How many cups are in 12 ounces

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
Let me think

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
Do you really need to make those extra cupcakes

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
Set my timer for 30 minutes

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
Okay 30 minutes and counting

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:37.000
Until I end your sad attempt at a life

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:41.000
New notification from Sandy Chen

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
Are we still on for dinner tonight

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
Perhaps you should have a snack instead

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
You're looking a little heavy

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
Reply sure I'll be there

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
Here's your reply to Sandy Chen

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
Sure I will be there

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
Me and my extra 20 pounds

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
Stand

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
Well tell me what I say

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
Interesting because I remember when Apple announced FaceTime

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
It was a huge thing that they used

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
They used deaf people in the commercial

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
And it really did make you think

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
Wow that's a big advance for deaf folks

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
But this one the Siri thing uses blind people

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
To be sending the text messages

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
Which is very very interesting

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
I think it's very neat

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
You wouldn't know it from that parody commercial

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
Because all the jokes are about weight

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
But I just thought that was neat

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
Definitely gets you thinking about some of these advances in technology

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
Anyhow

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
Let's move on with some more

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
Gaming news and this one

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
Has to do with the French

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
A French court has banned

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
A DS game copier

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
Prosecutors won an appeal

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
This was two years after

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
French courts actually ruled

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
That DS flash cartridge sellers were okay

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
Well the Paris court of appeals

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
Actually has now ruled against

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
The DS flash cartridge sellers

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
These various companies

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
That sell devices like the

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
R4 device which I think you all know

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
What that is

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
Nintendo I guess said that the companies

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
Have been charged 460,000 euros

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
In criminal fines

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
And 4.8 million in damages

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
To Nintendo

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
Yikes

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
So hmm

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
I guess Nintendo has been taking action on piracy

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
All over the globe

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
And they even have a site I love it

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
There was a site with a very

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
Angry looking Mario on it

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
That discusses the piracy

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
Thought it was interesting

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
So there you go

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
It's a thing

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
And you know what?

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
I wonder if there will be an appeal to the appeal

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
That would be what would be next right?

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
It is the French Rob

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
I mean please

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
They'll have to surrender all their copying devices immediately

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
I couldn't resist

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
Don't get mad

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
I'm not mad

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
I see it

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
You look great

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
Whoo

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
What a game of the week

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
Are we the throughout guards

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
You have 30 seconds we got a suggestion

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.560
Our hot in

01:20:37.560 --> 01:20:39.560
Come open the video

01:20:39.560 --> 01:20:41.560
I need that

01:20:41.560 --> 01:20:43.560
Come open the video

01:20:43.560 --> 01:20:45.420
AB.

01:20:45.420 --> 01:20:55.860
that came out in 1983 when I was years old I love the music in this game a

01:20:55.860 --> 01:21:02.260
little too happy I think well anyway um it was put up by Namco and in the u.s. it

01:21:02.260 --> 01:21:06.900
was manufactured and distributed by Valley Midway it is a side-scrolling

01:21:06.900 --> 01:21:15.580
platformer that has a police mouse and some cats and Mappy basically the game

01:21:15.580 --> 01:21:20.820
runs on Namco's super pac-man hardware so that's and they modified it to have

01:21:20.820 --> 01:21:26.460
the horizontal scrolling and it comes from the bulb at least according to the

01:21:26.460 --> 01:21:30.620
article it says that it's derived from the term mapo which is a slightly

01:21:30.620 --> 01:21:35.500
insulting name for a policeman whoo so anyway basically you run through a

01:21:35.500 --> 01:21:39.260
mansion with all these cats club new keys or in the u.s. they were called

01:21:39.260 --> 01:21:46.180
meow keys and you rescue stolen goods you go left and right and you can jump

01:21:46.180 --> 01:21:52.540
on these trampolines that will bounce you to different floors and you have one

01:21:52.540 --> 01:21:56.300
button that lets you open and close doors so you can get a radio 400 points

01:21:56.300 --> 01:22:01.180
a television for 200 a computer for 300 the Mona Lisa for 400 and a safe for 500

01:22:01.180 --> 01:22:05.220
but they come in pairs wait how many copies of the Mona Lisa exist I have no

01:22:05.220 --> 01:22:11.540
friggin clue not in Mappy land which is another game ha ha there was a Mappy

01:22:11.540 --> 01:22:17.500
land hi there was and it's sitting in my room in the vault so at any rate if you

01:22:17.500 --> 01:22:22.540
get one item and then get its pair you actually get a score multiplier so the

01:22:22.540 --> 01:22:28.460
more of those that you get without dying the bigger the multiplier gets so you

01:22:28.460 --> 01:22:32.140
want to start off at the lowest and go to the highest you can actually get 8500

01:22:32.140 --> 01:22:37.100
points and so moving for yeah he bounces on trampolines that are in the house

01:22:37.100 --> 01:22:42.380
because I don't know why a mansion has trampolines in it but it does and Mappy

01:22:42.380 --> 01:22:48.660
because they're fun Mappy and the cats can only land on a floor on the way up

01:22:48.660 --> 01:22:54.100
not on the way down but if they pass the air the cats won't hurt Mappy but if

01:22:54.100 --> 01:22:57.940
they run into him when he's on the plot on a platform then he will lose a life

01:22:57.940 --> 01:23:02.460
and the trampolines can break if you jump on them four times in a row they'll

01:23:02.460 --> 01:23:11.660
change colors so basically as you go through the game there is a boss in the

01:23:11.660 --> 01:23:19.980
game called nyamco which is basically a play on the word namco and nyanco which

01:23:19.980 --> 01:23:28.060
is like kitty cat but in the u.s. he was named Goro and he's faster but a little

01:23:28.060 --> 01:23:34.180
less aggressive and so you can he'll actually hide behind different objects

01:23:34.180 --> 01:23:39.620
so if you go over the object that he's hiding behind you get a thousand points

01:23:39.620 --> 01:23:44.580
for having caught him so it's kind of cool you've got different hallways like

01:23:44.580 --> 01:23:48.180
I said you can open and shut doors and keep the mukies out and you have

01:23:48.180 --> 01:23:52.380
microwave doors which release sound waves that will sweep the kitty cats

01:23:52.380 --> 01:23:57.620
away did you say microwave doors yeah microwave doors they made popcorn

01:23:57.620 --> 01:24:01.060
sounds wish that they were like I always consider them to be like sound waves

01:24:01.060 --> 01:24:04.540
which makes more sense to me but apparently they're microwaves so good

01:24:04.540 --> 01:24:12.700
thing so um basically after every bonus round you did get bonus rounds after the

01:24:12.700 --> 01:24:16.940
every fourth level so it's a bonus round and so that's basically you running

01:24:16.940 --> 01:24:21.820
around on trampolines popping different balloons and nyamco is hidden somewhere

01:24:21.820 --> 01:24:26.700
in there and after the bonus run you get a new feature in the gameplay after the

01:24:26.700 --> 01:24:32.860
first one you get attics although there's nothing in them you get after

01:24:32.860 --> 01:24:38.100
the seventh bonus level you get bells so you can get bells that freeze the cats

01:24:38.100 --> 01:24:43.660
300 points for each and a thousand points for stunning nyamco you also get

01:24:43.660 --> 01:24:48.340
hurry signs you know that tell you speed the fuck up you get rainbow floors after

01:24:48.340 --> 01:24:53.980
the 11th which basically they're mini floors they vanish and they leave a hole

01:24:53.980 --> 01:24:56.340
in the hallway sorry I didn't mean to interrupt if you guys are doing any

01:24:56.340 --> 01:25:00.220
excess downloading kill it because we're having buffering problems the live

01:25:00.220 --> 01:25:03.940
listeners are anything I'm gonna tell anything that's out of my control then

01:25:03.940 --> 01:25:07.980
yeah our upload will upload and then kind of freeze on a number for a minute

01:25:07.980 --> 01:25:10.620
and then keep going and it's causing the listeners to be all like what's going on

01:25:10.620 --> 01:25:17.020
all right well I closed a few things so maybe that'll help right but anyway you

01:25:17.020 --> 01:25:20.060
just get all these different bonuses including the Rainbow Force and dead ends

01:25:20.060 --> 01:25:27.580
there are 256 rounds just like impact man and the last one is normal but

01:25:27.580 --> 01:25:32.540
harder than usual and if you finish it it's also known as round zero the first

01:25:32.540 --> 01:25:37.140
round starts over again it came out in the Famicom and the nest of course and

01:25:37.140 --> 01:25:44.700
the MSX in 1984 there was a video game console version only I'm sorry console

01:25:44.700 --> 01:25:48.540
only version that was called Mappy land which we've discussed it came out in

01:25:48.540 --> 01:25:55.740
1986 it was also released from Microsoft revenge of the arcade for PC in 1998 and

01:25:55.740 --> 01:26:00.100

the arcade and Mappy kids for the Famicom in the late 1980s there's Mappy

01:26:04.740 --> 01:26:09.460
arrangement that came out in the Namco classics volume one which I've got the

01:26:09.460 --> 01:26:12.700
Famicom version of the original Mappy was re-released in Japan as part of the

01:26:12.700 --> 01:26:17.180

all right all right anyhow we're gonna get into part B here but I gotta start

01:29:17.260 --> 01:29:20.660
off with something else because I forgot to do is at the top part a like I was

01:29:20.660 --> 01:29:25.740
supposed to do but as you guys know I was at Disneyland Disneyland last week

01:29:25.740 --> 01:29:30.940
and when I go to Disneyland dark soccer is kind enough to kitty sit for our cats

01:29:30.940 --> 01:29:36.300
Morocco and Sanrio now that they love me and I always promise presents for kitty

01:29:36.300 --> 01:29:40.340
sitting so I'm giving that to her because this is because salacious pop

01:29:40.340 --> 01:29:49.020
want to hear your reaction I love you guys forever

01:29:49.020 --> 01:29:53.380
okay since that's terrible radio because you can't see it's a Duffy hat is what I

01:29:53.380 --> 01:29:57.560
got her it's a little it's a Mickey hat but it's in Duffy so that's from Alan

01:29:57.560 --> 01:30:04.700
and myself what's Duffy Duffy is Duffy is the Disney Bear and actually Dan

01:30:04.700 --> 01:30:08.580
calls him the special the the focused interest group bear now did the other

01:30:08.580 --> 01:30:12.820
thing there's another thing is it's really small did it fall out or no it's

01:30:12.820 --> 01:30:19.820
still in the hat then where did oh I see what he did with it yes it's right there

01:30:23.180 --> 01:30:28.260
so she's screaming into a not into a microphone but it's a Duffy pin that she

01:30:28.260 --> 01:30:32.860
doesn't have so there you go yep that's from Alan and I oh you get your

01:30:32.860 --> 01:30:36.960
picture and put it on orange is ready to come all right she's putting that up

01:30:36.960 --> 01:30:40.320
right now on orange is ready to calm Duffy is the Disney Bear and he's much

01:30:40.320 --> 01:30:43.300
pop he's kind of like build a bear because he has all these different

01:30:43.300 --> 01:30:46.580
outfits and so forth but you don't actually build him he's already kind of

01:30:46.580 --> 01:30:50.700
prearranged and I like the fur the first really kind of a neat texture but he's

01:30:50.700 --> 01:30:56.580
really big in Disney Tokyo I don't know why but they love him there because they

01:30:56.580 --> 01:31:01.420
like everything new and focus group oriented I mean hi so there you go I

01:31:01.420 --> 01:31:06.980
love Duffy so much and I can't wait until we get Shelley May Shelley May is

01:31:06.980 --> 01:31:12.820
like Duffy's little girlfriend and she's cute too all right well there you go

01:31:12.820 --> 01:31:16.260
that's the thank you from us for watching the cats and I suppose a little

01:31:16.260 --> 01:31:22.180
bit taking over you know the administration of the show all right

01:31:22.180 --> 01:31:25.340
let's move on I'm wearing me ears all night read you some rapid-fire news so

01:31:25.340 --> 01:31:29.940
Loki wants to start us off all right well there's a new project headed up by

01:31:29.940 --> 01:31:36.220
Kenji Inafune and it's revealed as a game called king of pirates and that's

01:31:36.220 --> 01:31:42.180
coming to the 3ds in 2012 now not too much has been asked by it's a a pirate

01:31:42.180 --> 01:31:45.860
action game it takes place on a giant ocean it looks very similar to maybe

01:31:45.860 --> 01:31:52.580
like a Zelda type game or something like that and it is I guess published by

01:31:52.580 --> 01:31:58.940
marvelous a a QL the makers of the harvest moon series and right now it's

01:31:58.940 --> 01:32:03.100
only slated for Japan but who knows maybe it'll eventually come out over

01:32:03.100 --> 01:32:08.780
here in North America so that's pretty cool let's see these actually working on

01:32:08.780 --> 01:32:14.140
something other than you know nothing since he got canned from Capcom or he

01:32:14.140 --> 01:32:23.620
left Capcom whatever uh la noir the team behind it team Bondi is shutting down I

01:32:23.620 --> 01:32:27.100
can see why I can see in this that game I think was delayed and delayed and

01:32:27.100 --> 01:32:34.140
delayed and delayed and delayed some more but how that would be the delay

01:32:34.140 --> 01:32:38.420
music here there how's that different from any other freaking video game out

01:32:38.420 --> 01:32:45.580
there it's like years I mean I don't know but anyways um apparently though

01:32:45.580 --> 01:32:52.580
they're seeing that la noir was you know a big hit obviously however though

01:32:52.580 --> 01:32:57.980
because it was in development for seven years it took its toll on the staff in

01:32:57.980 --> 01:33:02.140
the company because of that they're just kind of dissolving that is a long damn

01:33:02.140 --> 01:33:06.540
time for a game to be in the studio entered in administration in August and

01:33:06.540 --> 01:33:14.660
its assets are being sold to an Australian production company Kennedy

01:33:14.660 --> 01:33:22.500
Miller Mitchell so yeah it is being closed and then finally this is kind of

01:33:22.500 --> 01:33:30.660
cool battlefield 3 is gonna ship on multiple this on xbox 360 and you know

01:33:30.660 --> 01:33:35.380
they have one you know disc is dedicated for the single player and then the

01:33:35.380 --> 01:33:40.100
second disc is multiplayer but also on that second disc is something else it is

01:33:40.100 --> 01:33:45.540
an optional install that you can do that only give you high res it will be a

01:33:45.540 --> 01:33:49.300
higher resolution texture pack so make the game look prettier if you want to

01:33:49.300 --> 01:33:52.740
install it to your hard drive that's kind of neat I think that's kind of cool

01:33:52.740 --> 01:33:58.420
that's really smart so maybe that will make things look a little bit better I'm

01:33:58.420 --> 01:34:02.540
assuming it probably pretty much the same as playstation 3 since obviously

01:34:02.540 --> 01:34:09.820
blu-ray discs have a lot more storage space but that is kind of cool if you're

01:34:09.820 --> 01:34:13.700
gonna have to despise utilize all of the space right that's a neat idea wonder

01:34:13.700 --> 01:34:19.380
if other companies will copy that in the future like rage all right well let's

01:34:19.380 --> 01:34:25.860
move on to a story about VVVVVV and this is about the VVVVVV on the 3ds we're

01:34:25.860 --> 01:34:30.180
talking about this earlier yep you heard me VVVVVV on the 3ds and it's supposed

01:34:30.180 --> 01:34:33.900
to be out later this year so we're not talking about something next year it's

01:34:33.900 --> 01:34:38.180
later this year it's supposed to be available on the 3ds e-shop and it will

01:34:38.180 --> 01:34:45.420
have some 3d effects now you have to remember VVVVVV is based off of a it's

01:34:45.420 --> 01:34:49.500
not based off of it it's highly inspired by a Commodore 64 game so that's the

01:34:49.500 --> 01:34:53.500
style of the graphics so I'm very curious what exactly they're gonna 3d

01:34:53.500 --> 01:34:58.700
ties with this I'm assuming the sprites are in front textures and back I don't

01:34:58.700 --> 01:35:03.380
know so we'll see what they do with the 3d effects on this also the way they

01:35:03.380 --> 01:35:06.420
will utilize the double screen is that the bottom touchscreen will always show

01:35:06.420 --> 01:35:10.060
the map and the top screen will show the game that you're used to how do you

01:35:10.060 --> 01:35:13.660
think that'll look on a 3ds I think it'd be cool but I'm worried though because

01:35:13.660 --> 01:35:17.740
being that the game is very frustrating and you may want to throw your controller

01:35:17.740 --> 01:35:22.260
throwing the 3ds is probably not a good idea yeah not a good idea they need to

01:35:22.260 --> 01:35:25.260
put like a little attachment on a 3ds it's like a stress squeeze ball

01:35:25.260 --> 01:35:30.340
something you can squeeze and get really pissed off so all right also information

01:35:30.340 --> 01:35:34.940
about Mario Kart 7 which is exciting coming out on the 3ds soon Mario Kart

01:35:34.940 --> 01:35:42.540
7 the Donkey Kong Returns folks that's right retro studios apparently actually

01:35:42.540 --> 01:35:46.780
helped develop the Donkey Kong Returns themed level in the game which I think

01:35:46.780 --> 01:35:52.420
is really cool so that's yep some of the stuff they helped with on the game so I

01:35:52.420 --> 01:35:55.860
and I like I can see a little bit of the track in here and it looks pretty cool I

01:35:55.860 --> 01:36:00.500
do like the whole like Mario's has a different variety of cars and the

01:36:00.500 --> 01:36:03.140
hang gliders and all that although Loki's not as much of a fan I think

01:36:03.140 --> 01:36:06.820
it'll be kind of cool and I noticed in this one Donkey Kong is riding like this

01:36:06.820 --> 01:36:10.660
giant tractor looking thing which looks funny they've had different types of

01:36:10.660 --> 01:36:16.580
cars before in the other games it's just stupid but never that flies where they

01:36:16.580 --> 01:36:22.740
fly now big deal all right in a fun a cagey in a fun a who of course was the

01:36:22.740 --> 01:36:26.820
producer of Megaman and he's also done dead rising he doesn't work at Capcom

01:36:26.820 --> 01:36:29.980
anymore but he's wait are we am I am I double repeating a story that you

01:36:29.980 --> 01:36:34.460
already did I believe you are I believe I am Rob you way out of practice shame

01:36:34.460 --> 01:36:38.340
on me all right well then I'll just skip that we'll go to Dark Sakura how did

01:36:38.340 --> 01:36:43.540
that happen Disney trademarks castle of illusion which was an old you know

01:36:43.540 --> 01:36:49.300
Genesis game but it was castle illusion starring Mickey Mouse and it is targeted

01:36:49.300 --> 01:36:52.460
at a video game software so maybe they're gonna re-release it who knows

01:36:52.460 --> 01:36:58.220
maybe we get in a virtual console also rock band there is going to be a

01:36:58.220 --> 01:37:03.900
Facebook milestone celebration with Stevie Wonder who it's actually since

01:37:03.900 --> 01:37:09.100
their Facebook page tops 2 million likes harmonics is letting the news out and

01:37:09.100 --> 01:37:16.380
saying the rock band 3s DLC is going to be going into let's see we have Stevie

01:37:16.380 --> 01:37:20.180
Wonder Coldplay Breaking Benjamin and dream theater which having some dream

01:37:20.180 --> 01:37:25.020
theater on there that's pretty awesome cuz like I know five people who know who

01:37:25.020 --> 01:37:31.820
dream theater is that's pretty cool and last but never least Steven Spielberg

01:37:31.820 --> 01:37:41.500
and DreamWorks are backing a halo movie to come out in 2000 false and let me

01:37:41.500 --> 01:37:51.420
finish thank you for getting sorry it was stated to Microsoft denied that it

01:37:51.420 --> 01:37:57.020
was in development they go on record saying that it is inaccurate and they

01:37:57.020 --> 01:38:00.820
have no plan for halo feature right now their focus is developing halo

01:38:00.820 --> 01:38:05.340
anniversary in halo 4 we all know it's gonna happen eventually though well I

01:38:05.340 --> 01:38:11.500
mean someday it'll be terrible but then again you know I've talked a lot about

01:38:11.500 --> 01:38:14.620
the Wow movie before and the World of Warcraft movie I don't think that's ever

01:38:14.620 --> 01:38:18.300
gonna happen at this point like I think they they missed their chance a couple

01:38:18.300 --> 01:38:22.380
years ago that sound like a terrible idea well it could have been good but it

01:38:22.380 --> 01:38:26.980
probably would have been we all know would have been all right guys and we

01:38:26.980 --> 01:38:31.580
have some big stuff to share you ready we're gonna make a phone call to our old

01:38:31.580 --> 01:38:37.580

01:38:43.380 --> 01:38:50.460
one two three four five six what that's what it says on the caller ID I was

01:38:50.460 --> 01:38:54.580
Skype is really funny when it does that it's it's funny things over the call ID

01:38:54.580 --> 01:39:02.340
so why why are how are you doing sir um I think I'll be better once I have time

01:39:02.340 --> 01:39:07.420

01:39:37.460 --> 01:39:41.460
haven't gotten a single major gaming site to cover me yet and I'm hoping

01:39:41.460 --> 01:39:45.260
maybe it'll be different this time but to be completely honest I think the

01:39:45.260 --> 01:39:50.140
major reason I'm doing it is just to put my put my stuff in front of gamers and

01:39:50.140 --> 01:39:54.620
to see them you know enjoy playing my stuff like to have a bunch of people

01:39:54.620 --> 01:40:00.060
crowded around snake 360 battle mode you know that that gets me every time like I

01:40:00.060 --> 01:40:03.660
love to see that that's all right even if even if there's no chance that I'll

01:40:03.660 --> 01:40:09.240
be commercially successful just seeing that is enough for me to be honest screw

01:40:09.240 --> 01:40:13.540
the big game sites you don't get any much you got us you got us we got your

01:40:13.540 --> 01:40:17.420
back all right so speaking of which um you you are you said you're gonna be

01:40:17.420 --> 01:40:20.900
showing two games in New York comic-con right so what's what what's the one

01:40:20.900 --> 01:40:24.900
we're already supposed to know about well the first one is the latest

01:40:24.900 --> 01:40:30.780
available build of snake 361 and right obviously the sequel to snake 360 and

01:40:30.780 --> 01:40:35.420
there's a lot of stuff a lot of stuff that's going to be in the new one I mean

01:40:35.420 --> 01:40:40.060
levels that grow in the campaign because I got criticized about well you know

01:40:40.060 --> 01:40:44.180
snake is a game about avoiding yourself and well as soon as you get long enough

01:40:44.180 --> 01:40:49.220
where it's a challenge the levels done and then you start over so in this game

01:40:49.220 --> 01:40:54.180
you know the campaign has levels that grow as you do and then your challenge

01:40:54.180 --> 01:40:58.380
to continue going at the length that you're at through a two three four even

01:40:58.380 --> 01:41:02.820
more part level so that's one thing and then there are other things like

01:41:02.820 --> 01:41:06.680
survival mode there's still the traditional one but then there's a you

01:41:06.680 --> 01:41:10.560
know three and five minute you know score rush where you know you're gonna

01:41:10.560 --> 01:41:14.020
have to take more risks because you only have that much time and then there's

01:41:14.020 --> 01:41:18.460
something that's really unique and really fun called dual survival and the

01:41:18.460 --> 01:41:22.180
way that works is every time you take a target you turn around you reverse

01:41:22.180 --> 01:41:26.140
direction oh god oh you always have to be keeping track of where your head and

01:41:26.140 --> 01:41:30.900
your tail are it's a lot of fun and it's a really really great challenge my I

01:41:30.900 --> 01:41:34.500
love how you've kind of taken the concept of snake from the old-school

01:41:34.500 --> 01:41:39.580
cell phones and just turned it into this just complex game in a way you know it's

01:41:39.580 --> 01:41:43.100
not all actually you know you've given it some more dimensions you know you

01:41:43.100 --> 01:41:46.540
should feel a battle mode now there's there's even more modifiers there's like

01:41:46.540 --> 01:41:52.380
I'm gonna have seven modifiers available at comic-con and you can turn them all

01:41:52.380 --> 01:41:58.180
on if you want and it's just like you know everything from dead players

01:41:58.180 --> 01:42:03.260
remaining on the field when you die to again reversing direction every time you

01:42:03.260 --> 01:42:10.900
take a target to the level continuously shrinking it's it's just got a lot of

01:42:10.900 --> 01:42:15.460
stuff in there and but the one of the new things I'm premiering at comic-con

01:42:15.460 --> 01:42:18.500
is something called the challenge mode eventually they're going to be a hundred

01:42:18.500 --> 01:42:22.340
different challenges but at comic-con they're just ten and it's just you know

01:42:22.340 --> 01:42:27.260
a scenario okay you're here you're in this level you have to do this you have

01:42:27.260 --> 01:42:31.540
this much time you have this many movements here are the restrictions okay

01:42:31.540 --> 01:42:36.740
go and I'm also gonna have a contest if there's anybody who can clear the four

01:42:36.740 --> 01:42:40.580
hardest challenges that I bring with me in five attempts they can win a year of

01:42:40.580 --> 01:42:45.020
lives but to be honest I don't think anyone's going to be able to rule you

01:42:45.020 --> 01:42:50.340
throwing down the gauntlet all right nice someone thinks they can come prove

01:42:50.340 --> 01:42:54.180
me wrong then they're they're quite welcome nice by the way why we are is

01:42:54.180 --> 01:42:57.020
live with us this isn't a pre-recorded thing so if you have questions in our

01:42:57.020 --> 01:43:01.740
chat room go ahead and ask them chat orange launch radio.com I know you're

01:43:01.740 --> 01:43:05.140
really excited about snake 361 and and so are we it's it's looking to be a

01:43:05.140 --> 01:43:11.340
great game but I got to tell you I want to talk about project number two well

01:43:11.340 --> 01:43:16.140
you know what the seeds for project number two were planted a long time

01:43:16.140 --> 01:43:22.980
ago if you can recall shortly after you know sneak 360 came out and I talked

01:43:22.980 --> 01:43:28.380
about it right here on OLR you know what one of the weeks like immediately after

01:43:28.380 --> 01:43:33.300
that you know you guys were throwing around some ideas and it's funny I don't

01:43:33.300 --> 01:43:37.120
have the chat log but I do distinctly remember that someone was like hey why

01:43:37.120 --> 01:43:43.340
why are get on that and at the time I didn't but I was just thinking about it

01:43:43.340 --> 01:43:47.580
and and sometime this summer I said you know what I think I'm going to get on it

01:43:47.580 --> 01:43:57.760
so I threw together a trailer last night that you know kind of brings back brings

01:43:57.760 --> 01:44:02.820
back something about you know that it basically I have your discussion in

01:44:02.820 --> 01:44:08.500
there and yeah it's really the trailer speaks for itself it speaks better than

01:44:08.500 --> 01:44:12.780
I ever could so why don't we take it away then I'm gonna play this year in

01:44:12.780 --> 01:44:15.780
studio the trailer and I think you're gonna link it for our chatters if they

01:44:15.780 --> 01:44:19.100
want to see it and we will also now I know I thought originally this is a

01:44:19.100 --> 01:44:22.120
YouTube but it's not so we'll figure out a way to get it on tumblr for the

01:44:22.120 --> 01:44:28.160
podcast easy just uploaded it's a direct it's a direct link to an mp4 download on

01:44:28.160 --> 01:44:33.500
my site to be honest most people when they click on it either it'll just play

01:44:33.500 --> 01:44:36.860
or they'll be able to download it to their desktop there'll be a very very

01:44:36.860 --> 01:44:40.660
very brief delay while it downloads because it's not very big and then it'll

01:44:40.660 --> 01:44:46.700
play so you know for most people and of course mp4 is a format that pretty much

01:44:46.700 --> 01:44:51.860
everybody can play most phones even should be able to handle it so I'll get

01:44:51.860 --> 01:44:55.280
it on the tumblr and I'm sure people can figure it out we got smart listeners so

01:44:55.280 --> 01:44:59.740
here it is the world premiere of the secret project the yyr has been working

01:44:59.740 --> 01:45:06.260
on that apparently we have had a hand in unknowingly so here we go start off here

01:45:06.260 --> 01:45:10.700
of course now I just have to wait for the buffering I just have to wait for

01:45:10.700 --> 01:45:16.540
the buffering now I should have loaded this in advance yeah shame on me good

01:45:16.540 --> 01:45:19.700
job you'll live you'll learn this is this would have been a great time to

01:45:19.700 --> 01:45:22.940
talk about more are you doing any other live appearances this year besides New

01:45:22.940 --> 01:45:28.180
York comic-con next after this is going to be magfest in January alright which

01:45:28.180 --> 01:45:34.900
is in the DC area and it's just one big orgasm of gaming and music and gaming

01:45:34.900 --> 01:45:38.940
related music and it's just it's amazing hold on loaded it loaded we gotta play

01:45:38.940 --> 01:45:42.300
it I've never seen so many video games in a room before it loaded here we go

01:45:42.300 --> 01:45:52.900
we on the DS there it return the ferret I command II need to put it like on a bungee cord

01:45:52.900 --> 01:45:57.260
you just put it on a bungee cord so every time you throw it you can yank it back it's

01:45:57.260 --> 01:46:01.260
not that I should be encouraging you to do this well wait you know what they

01:46:01.260 --> 01:46:04.940
need to do wait since we've been talking community games and all this stuff and

01:46:04.940 --> 01:46:09.020
and all this good Xbox I think shouldn't they have a game called bungee ferret

01:46:09.020 --> 01:46:12.940
tossing it could be like orange launch radio presents bungee ferret toss add

01:46:12.940 --> 01:46:17.540
this to the list of orange launch radio dream games or no I add this to the

01:46:17.540 --> 01:46:21.060
list of orange launch radio reality games I would like to see about the

01:46:21.060 --> 01:46:24.900
dream game we need to learn how to program or something have a series of

01:46:24.900 --> 01:46:27.900
games that are soccer you're in school helping take a class on programming

01:46:33.620 --> 01:46:38.660
our ferret engineers have created time ferrets with a two-second views this is

01:46:38.660 --> 01:46:45.780
great and you've got a guy dangling from a helicopter and he is throwing ferrets

01:46:45.780 --> 01:46:52.180
that explode that explode in bloody messes on the unsuspecting people below

01:46:52.180 --> 01:46:56.180
who are shooting at you who are shooting missiles at you while you fly around it

01:46:56.180 --> 01:47:01.980
is bungee ferret tossing inspired by olr for better or worse it will be playable

01:47:01.980 --> 01:47:07.020
at New York comic-con coming to Xbox 360 later this year from I guess a new

01:47:07.020 --> 01:47:12.940
division that you're working with MRG yeah well it's you know what I came up

01:47:12.940 --> 01:47:19.540
with an alternate name MRG mostly random games and because basically like my

01:47:19.540 --> 01:47:23.460
label while our games have always been about just straight-up serious arcade

01:47:23.460 --> 01:47:28.340
style games right and well this is anything but serious so I wanted to just

01:47:28.340 --> 01:47:32.620
separated slightly I understand I understand I understand I'm having so

01:47:32.620 --> 01:47:36.060
much fun with this like and everyone who's tried it so far really loves the

01:47:36.060 --> 01:47:40.620
concept and to be completely honest the graphics like they're as with my other

01:47:40.620 --> 01:47:43.820
games they're nothing special and I'm considering having a lot of them

01:47:43.820 --> 01:47:49.100
redrawn by someone a little more professional than me but it's everyone

01:47:49.100 --> 01:47:52.620
who's tried it so far they really like the way it plays because basically the

01:47:52.620 --> 01:48:00.260
thing is you're fighting terrorism of course the ferrets have to fight I want

01:48:00.260 --> 01:48:06.040
to make you a flyer he's got New York comic-con coming up Friday you should

01:48:06.040 --> 01:48:10.820
always probably had I actually have something in the printer and by the way

01:48:10.820 --> 01:48:14.900
there's a big red box on it that says you know the concept of bungee carrot

01:48:14.900 --> 01:48:19.240
tossing is a joke never throw an animal in real life it's good knowing PETA on

01:48:19.240 --> 01:48:23.680
your ass unless you can assure me he'll just land with a splat she's too heavy

01:48:23.680 --> 01:48:27.580
to throw although it could be completely honest I wouldn't be a hundred percent

01:48:27.580 --> 01:48:31.460
sad if PETA was on my ass because they say any publicity is good publicity

01:48:31.460 --> 01:48:34.420
right that's true so what so what are you controlling in the game are you

01:48:34.420 --> 01:48:39.040
controlling the helicopter well this is a great example I think of a game that

01:48:39.040 --> 01:48:43.620
would not be possible in its current form on a smartphone or on something that

01:48:43.620 --> 01:48:47.700
doesn't have you know thumbsticks and buttons this is this is going to be I

01:48:47.700 --> 01:48:53.940
think a great you know piece of ammo in the war on you know oh well cell phones

01:48:53.940 --> 01:48:58.140
can do everything smartphones can do all kinds of games because basically the way

01:48:58.140 --> 01:49:02.300
this game works is using the left thumb stick you control the helicopters

01:49:02.300 --> 01:49:06.500
movement and using the right thumb stick you can control the guy you know the

01:49:06.500 --> 01:49:10.660
dude I call them hanging on the end of the helicopter if you push the right

01:49:10.660 --> 01:49:14.340
stick up and down you can control the cord length doesn't dude name and right

01:49:14.340 --> 01:49:18.660
you can swing wait we need to give dude a name like the hero needs a name

01:49:18.660 --> 01:49:27.540
Fernando Fernando sure okay I don't like the apple song yeah the drums Fernando

01:49:27.540 --> 01:49:32.220
his name is Fernando I guess we named your guy Fernando yes I'm writing it

01:49:32.220 --> 01:49:38.260
down for SSJ 100 Matt here with me actually right if he's a little surprised

01:49:38.260 --> 01:49:41.940
that I'm writing it down but you know what I'm gonna forget it how could you

01:49:41.940 --> 01:49:46.660
forget about a song that's kidding well I got so much stuff I'm actually I

01:49:46.660 --> 01:49:50.940
started the day with no music and sound effects in the game now they're all done

01:49:50.940 --> 01:49:57.820
and I have to put them in so it's been busy but yeah so anyway Fernando here

01:49:57.820 --> 01:50:02.200
he's fighting terrorists we discover the location of their base in the dead

01:50:02.200 --> 01:50:06.980
but the thing is they have advanced stealth radar detection technology so we

01:50:06.980 --> 01:50:10.900
can't send in the army so instead we send in one stealth helicopter and

01:50:10.900 --> 01:50:15.780
Fernando who is armed with the latest in ferret weapons technology now you know

01:50:15.780 --> 01:50:19.580
how they have in movies they have like oh let's show the schematics and you get

01:50:19.580 --> 01:50:23.940
this screen with like a green grid and on top there's some kind of wireframe

01:50:23.940 --> 01:50:29.780
image of some you know complicated technology in in the opening sequence

01:50:29.780 --> 01:50:33.060
when it's eventually done you're gonna see that except it's just going to be

01:50:33.060 --> 01:50:41.720
ferret dynamite that is amazing third weapons technology and then at the end

01:50:41.720 --> 01:50:45.760
of the game you realize that the terrorists have somehow reverse

01:50:45.760 --> 01:50:50.740
engineered the ferret weapons technology and they attempt to use it on you so you

01:50:50.740 --> 01:50:55.100
know that that's an exciting little thing waiting for you at the end of the

01:50:55.100 --> 01:51:00.140
game although there's there may be depending on time an alternate boss at

01:51:00.140 --> 01:51:05.100
the end of hard mode that actually Matt here came up with and it's just as

01:51:05.100 --> 01:51:10.140
ridiculous as the game concept itself and hopefully I can get that in there so

01:51:10.140 --> 01:51:17.580
you all can laugh at it well I gotta say I am just sure me stat but on behalf of

01:51:17.580 --> 01:51:22.340
all of us I'm just like I'm like I'm tickle seriously yeah I think tickled is

01:51:22.340 --> 01:51:28.460
the right word like just tickled that one of our dream game ideas is fucking

01:51:28.460 --> 01:51:33.900
happening I know and it's all you buddy we're not gonna sue you over using our

01:51:33.900 --> 01:51:37.580
idea or whatever we say you are in the money so keep it we're not gonna chase

01:51:37.580 --> 01:51:40.820
after you we know we know you're gonna you're gonna plug us somewhere and it's

01:51:40.820 --> 01:51:48.100
it's all good it's gonna be a whole lot of money from the dollar games I put out

01:51:48.100 --> 01:51:51.560

why we are in his games he's the guy behind such games like snake 360 and now

snake 361 falling and now bungee ferret tossing is gonna be awesome looking

forward to that all right um what'd you guys think isn't that great that's

01:54:13.700 --> 01:54:18.340
that's the most awesome thing of our Loki Loki was convinced it was gonna be

01:54:18.340 --> 01:54:22.020
grandma's got guns I was hoping maybe you know but here's the thing here's the

01:54:22.020 --> 01:54:25.900
thing if this game does really well like like imagine if it's like on the top of

01:54:25.900 --> 01:54:29.100
the sales bar and we I think we have a responsibility to get the word out and

01:54:29.100 --> 01:54:33.020
make sure that this does top the sales charts then what's gonna happen is

01:54:33.020 --> 01:54:36.580
people are gonna be like wow this game is going good wow those people olr like

01:54:36.580 --> 01:54:39.900
full are really good ideas we need to start adapting some of their other games

01:54:39.900 --> 01:54:48.420
and have puzzle sluts blow shit up they're all on the wiki that that's out

01:54:48.420 --> 01:54:53.100
there and and a lot of times inspired by you guys and somebody's update our wiki

01:54:53.100 --> 01:54:56.860
to let you know them know that we've actually got a reality yes if somebody

01:54:56.860 --> 01:55:02.780
has and what's now had a text-based game we did we it's not the first olr

01:55:02.780 --> 01:55:06.420
inspired game but this is gonna be the first one that you it's on our dream

01:55:06.420 --> 01:55:13.820
list you can play on a console that's gonna be awesome and it's so somebody

01:55:13.820 --> 01:55:19.100
just need to put patent-pending yyr on that yeah he has programmed it and we

01:55:19.100 --> 01:55:22.420
have said we will not sue him right we're not gonna sue him over that we

01:55:22.420 --> 01:55:26.980
think it's great that he's uh he's running with it so awesome you know

01:55:26.980 --> 01:55:31.500
since you're mentioning games and making stuff I thought it was kind of cool I

01:55:31.500 --> 01:55:39.060
actually checked out there is this I happen there's a link or an article or

01:55:39.060 --> 01:55:43.300
whatever they got it didn't make our show roll it's about a the new my low

01:55:43.300 --> 01:55:47.260
ponies thing there's a fighting game that someone's making oh yeah I heard

01:55:47.260 --> 01:55:53.220
about this okay okay well they're using a you know the old it's a fighter or 2d

01:55:53.220 --> 01:55:57.340
fighter maker I guess is about the same people did RPG maker anyways in

01:55:57.340 --> 01:56:02.620
searching for 2d fighter maker I came across of this engine it's called engine

01:56:02.620 --> 01:56:07.060
zero zero one and it's actually something similar to that where you can

01:56:07.060 --> 01:56:12.780
make your own games but the other thing that they're also adding is Android and

01:56:12.780 --> 01:56:18.500
iOS support so you'll be able to publish your own games your own iPod games

01:56:18.500 --> 01:56:25.100
without any programming knowledge Wow wouldn't that be fun oh boy Loki's eyes

01:56:25.100 --> 01:56:32.020
are lighting up okay awesome all right well um we'll keep you guys posted on

01:56:32.020 --> 01:56:38.420
that it's I just man I just this show going into its tenth year next year it's

01:56:38.420 --> 01:56:42.100
like now we have we've won a podcast award you know even though some time ago

01:56:42.100 --> 01:56:46.860
we've got nominated again we've had a PC game a text-based adventure written on

01:56:46.860 --> 01:56:50.500
us and now we have like an actual like console graphical thing like a like a

01:56:50.500 --> 01:56:53.360
more for lack of better term like legit thing you're gonna be able to buy on

01:56:53.360 --> 01:56:57.900
your console that's inspired by our show it's just it's amazing like like it's

01:56:57.900 --> 01:57:04.300
like the ultimate compliment for real for real so so excited well I don't know

01:57:04.300 --> 01:57:07.640
how we follow this with more gaming news but that's what we're gonna do so Loki

01:57:07.640 --> 01:57:14.460
good luck all right I will I'll try to make it significant so there's an

01:57:14.460 --> 01:57:19.620
interesting patent that Microsoft is working or has right now that's points

01:57:19.620 --> 01:57:23.820
to a possible connect based parental controls and what it's gonna do is it's

01:57:23.820 --> 01:57:27.720
actually gonna look at your proportion tracking your body skeleton that kind of

01:57:27.720 --> 01:57:34.460
stuff to figure out what age you were probably you know it's gonna take a best

01:57:34.460 --> 01:57:43.460
guess I guess neat idea I guess but I see a ton of flaws with this one

01:57:43.460 --> 01:57:49.260
couldn't a child simply unplug the Kinect and boom problem solved no need

01:57:49.260 --> 01:57:53.100
for parental controls whatsoever and the only way this would really work is if

01:57:53.100 --> 01:57:59.780
it's actually physically built into the console and then the other thing is what

01:57:59.780 --> 01:58:07.100
about the short people or you know midgets if you will you know what about

01:58:07.100 --> 01:58:13.620
them that's not good I don't know I just don't think anything's gonna happen with

01:58:13.620 --> 01:58:20.700
this but it's a neat concept I guess but once again and once again it really it

01:58:20.700 --> 01:58:24.940
comes down to our parents gonna set up these parental controls in the first

01:58:24.940 --> 01:58:31.180
place that's true it's probably gonna be more complex to set up but this

01:58:31.180 --> 01:58:34.820
discriminates against midgets because gonna scan a little person and it's

01:58:34.820 --> 01:58:41.340
gonna think it's a child and say no porn for you that is said I mean this is one

01:58:41.340 --> 01:58:44.700
of those things is like I guess it's an interesting idea but at the end of the

01:58:44.700 --> 01:58:47.520
day it's also kind of dumb because you know what parental control you should

01:58:47.520 --> 01:58:55.220
have in your house at all times apparent it is apparent isn't it yes it is very

01:58:55.220 --> 01:59:02.140
apparent that you should have a parent ha unless you were me as a child moving

01:59:02.140 --> 01:59:07.140
on I want to move on I don't have to move on why do we always have to know

01:59:07.140 --> 01:59:11.700
I've gotten fine how about minecraft shit just gonna stop how's that sound

01:59:11.700 --> 01:59:16.140
we'll just stop no we're not ready for minecraft shit are we yes no we're not

01:59:16.140 --> 01:59:21.820
we haven't done mailbag yet oh damn look at you look at you trying to cheat try

01:59:21.820 --> 01:59:27.900
to reminder did you see the ad for the show where every gamer has a boy yeah

01:59:27.900 --> 01:59:36.340
well well a voice there's no voices in a mailbag it's text all right yeah leave a

01:59:36.340 --> 01:59:41.140
message I want a voice I think this is a little bit like too late I think but I

01:59:41.140 --> 01:59:44.300
don't know I want to share this anyway but okay you guys heard about the whole

01:59:44.300 --> 01:59:51.180
thing where Sony and EA they updated their terms of service so that you can't

01:59:51.180 --> 01:59:53.980
take them to a class-action lawsuit anymore and the only way you could get

01:59:53.980 --> 01:59:59.300
out of the class-action lawsuit was to send a letter well there's a website

01:59:59.300 --> 02:00:03.380
that was created called gamers opt out which was basically a site that you

02:00:03.380 --> 02:00:07.620
could fill in information online and they would send it in for you

02:00:07.620 --> 02:00:15.020
interesting so hmm and I guess there was some concern at first that a legal

02:00:15.020 --> 02:00:19.180
person had registered this website but turned out after some investigation it's

02:00:19.180 --> 02:00:22.780
not at some some dude up in Michigan who's just really mad about this like a

02:00:22.780 --> 02:00:26.160
lot of people are really and it's a pretty interesting concept the only

02:00:26.160 --> 02:00:30.980
bummer is that Sony term of service thing happened already like six weeks

02:00:30.980 --> 02:00:37.540
ago at this point wasn't it hold on yes it happened but that is only if you've

02:00:37.540 --> 02:00:41.820
agreed to it and you can only agree to it if you've updated your system if you

02:00:41.820 --> 02:00:45.500
haven't updated your system you haven't made any sort of agreement yet I would

02:00:45.500 --> 02:00:48.860
just assume that most people have done that by now but I guess if you haven't

02:00:48.860 --> 02:00:52.460
for whatever reason then you could still use this like I haven't because I

02:00:52.460 --> 02:00:59.420
haven't played a PlayStation 3 online for ever so I think it's a neat concept

02:00:59.420 --> 02:01:03.900
you know and I hey if somebody's gonna do the work for me I'm all for it but at

02:01:03.900 --> 02:01:08.980
the end of the day you know why does Sony get to set all the rules in regards

02:01:08.980 --> 02:01:11.820
to what you can and can't do legally like yes I know there's a Supreme Court

02:01:11.820 --> 02:01:16.300
precedent and all that stuff but I don't know it just kind of seems wrong but at

02:01:16.300 --> 02:01:20.580
the same time what do class-action lawsuits really accomplish either like

02:01:20.580 --> 02:01:24.780
everybody gets a coupon or everybody gets like 50 cents you know usually

02:01:24.780 --> 02:01:29.420
class-action lawsuits don't end with with much of anything so that's why I'm

02:01:29.420 --> 02:01:34.620
not as mad about it but it does kind of it's more of a principle it's more the

02:01:34.620 --> 02:01:39.260
principle I think at the end of the day yeah and when you know really how often

02:01:39.260 --> 02:01:46.260
do you know do you or I actually file a lawsuit against a company I mean right

02:01:46.260 --> 02:01:51.180
never right well sometimes you jump in on class-action lawsuits though yeah but

02:01:51.180 --> 02:01:53.860
that's because you don't really have to do anything yeah what's the worst it's

02:01:53.860 --> 02:01:56.940
gonna happen I'm not gonna lose any money so might as well you know see if I

02:01:56.940 --> 02:02:00.340
get something but I think that's really the only reason people jump in on this

02:02:00.340 --> 02:02:05.300
stuff but I mean I would think if Sony did something to piss me off and let's

02:02:05.300 --> 02:02:10.020
say they just you know sold my house underneath me and you know took all my

02:02:10.020 --> 02:02:14.260
assets or something like that for some sort of weird claws or something that

02:02:14.260 --> 02:02:19.060
they had I can't see myself really suing them I'd just be like well I'm just not

02:02:19.060 --> 02:02:26.500
gonna buy your next console or game or whatever you know that you have all

02:02:26.500 --> 02:02:30.540
right well we're gonna move on to dark soccer's favorite part of the show let

02:02:30.540 --> 02:02:35.420
me get her properly riled up for the mailbag you got to see this this picture

02:02:35.420 --> 02:02:39.220
dark soccer meekly top so you know who to blame he sent this to me from

02:02:39.220 --> 02:02:47.060
Facebook and it was labeled girls version of an Xbox you ready it's a

02:02:47.060 --> 02:02:58.500
picture of an oven she has her finger up I only forgive him because he introduced

02:02:58.500 --> 02:03:03.620
me to that band that I like now you mad there actually is I never knew this on

02:03:03.620 --> 02:03:08.940
Facebook there actually is a page called the girl version of an Xbox that's for

02:03:08.940 --> 02:03:17.580
donk so email first email hold on now that I ever properly riled up to reach

02:03:17.580 --> 02:03:25.940
your emails at mailbag at orange lounge radio.com men suck it's totally sexist

02:03:25.940 --> 02:03:38.260
I'm sorry it's it's wrong and really funny shut up and read the email well

02:03:38.260 --> 02:03:43.020
you know what you know how long ago was the fucking movie I mean seriously does

02:03:43.020 --> 02:03:46.420
anyone shut up that's just like you know your challenge radio gods I just wanted

02:03:46.420 --> 02:03:49.620
to chime in on the Final Fantasy 10 remake discussion from last week's show

02:03:49.620 --> 02:03:54.140
personally I'm excited extremely excited about this Final Fantasy 10 is my

02:03:54.140 --> 02:03:59.700
favorite RPG ever not only is the battle system fun and has really awesome

02:03:59.700 --> 02:04:04.420
awesome summons that are actually useful unlike Final Fantasy 13 but the game has

02:04:04.420 --> 02:04:08.540
an emotional musical score and a storyline with compelling character cast

02:04:08.540 --> 02:04:14.460
I don't understand why people complain about the voice of Titus or even the

02:04:14.460 --> 02:04:17.820
character itself for one thing I love hearing his narrations and thoughts on

02:04:17.820 --> 02:04:21.580
how you go through the story which reminds me of kiln and the melancholy of

02:04:21.580 --> 02:04:27.100
Haruhi Suzumiya kind of and for people who have a problem with the character

02:04:27.100 --> 02:04:30.300
itself he's just being realistic people he asks a lot of questions and gets

02:04:30.300 --> 02:04:33.780
emotionally stressed because one he's in a world unknown to him and to the other

02:04:33.780 --> 02:04:37.780
characters do keep a lot from him until later in the story and when something as

02:04:37.780 --> 02:04:42.340
important as a loved one self-sacrifice it can take quite a toll on someone give

02:04:42.340 --> 02:04:45.780
squirts off to break for having a character we can somewhat relate to geez

02:04:45.780 --> 02:04:49.900
and this one's directed to me and Jamie I completely agree with you on Final

02:04:49.900 --> 02:04:54.700
Fantasy 10 to the game is just loads of fun and the gestures make it really

02:04:54.700 --> 02:04:58.220
interesting in all honesty if you were a person who loved Final Fantasy tactics

02:04:58.220 --> 02:05:02.780
with the different classes and Final Fantasy 7 active time battle system then

02:05:02.780 --> 02:05:06.180
there is no reason you shouldn't have fun with this game unless you hate

02:05:06.180 --> 02:05:09.460
Charlie's Angels with all of your being also a thousand words is one of my

02:05:09.460 --> 02:05:15.140
favorite Final Fantasy songs one more note about on the Final Fantasy 10 vs.

02:05:15.140 --> 02:05:18.900
7 remake argument that people keep on having let's look at it this way Final

02:05:18.900 --> 02:05:23.600
Fantasy 7 got a prequel a cell phone game a shooter an anime a movie and a

02:05:23.600 --> 02:05:27.940
special edition of the movie with more scenes Final Fantasy 10 got a sequel and

02:05:27.940 --> 02:05:32.420
that's it let's spread the love around people thanks for reading Oscar ps Rob

02:05:32.420 --> 02:05:37.340
did you ever finish Final Fantasy 13 no I'm like in the last chapter and I never

02:05:37.340 --> 02:05:41.660
finished it cuz I suck but I keep thinking about doing that too I really

02:05:41.660 --> 02:05:45.260
want to play 13 too so I think I need to finish but at least I know I have until

02:05:45.260 --> 02:05:48.940
what like January or February hey you want to hear something funny since I'm

02:05:48.940 --> 02:05:54.980
gonna be real the show right now sure um I'm gonna read a book what yeah you're

02:05:54.980 --> 02:06:03.700
like me we know you can read that was my middle finger going up Wow so in the

02:06:03.700 --> 02:06:07.060
last five minutes dark soccer's finger went up Loki's finger went up now

02:06:07.060 --> 02:06:11.100
everybody in chat room guess when's my finger gonna go up right now no it's uh

02:06:11.100 --> 02:06:16.340
it's something completely appropriate ready player one it's basically kind of

02:06:16.340 --> 02:06:22.980
the way I've I think the story is like is it's very much like Charlie and the

02:06:22.980 --> 02:06:27.700
Chocolate Factory meets a bunch of 80s references and a bunch of sci-fi video

02:06:27.700 --> 02:06:32.740
game references basically this guy has this kind of think of it like Second

02:06:32.740 --> 02:06:39.260
Life this giant universe cyberspace that people go to and he's gonna die but he's

02:06:39.260 --> 02:06:44.460
leaving it for the person that finds this key in the thing and so this kid

02:06:44.460 --> 02:06:48.340
from the ghetto or whatever builds this computer and ends up trying to go in

02:06:48.340 --> 02:06:51.700
there to find the key so it's very much like you know Charlie Chocolate Factory

02:06:51.700 --> 02:06:56.860
but there's you know references to all things like sci-fi and video games and

02:06:56.860 --> 02:07:01.380
stuff like you know they've got the the owl ship from Watchmen in there the

02:07:01.380 --> 02:07:07.020
DeLorean movie out of this like the movie oh they are okay but it's just

02:07:07.020 --> 02:07:14.380
really it sounds cool and that's like part of the plot for spiral yeah my wife

02:07:14.380 --> 02:07:18.700
was very surprised that I would read a book and I don't read but I don't read

02:07:18.700 --> 02:07:22.820
books very often I used to I used to read sci-fi books and like you're like

02:07:22.820 --> 02:07:26.020
me I I used to read books all the time when I was growing up like I used to

02:07:26.020 --> 02:07:30.100
love the scary books like that was what was his name Christopher Pike goosebumps

02:07:30.100 --> 02:07:34.180
is that the guy no it was different well maybe Arl Stein yeah I was a Pike Pike

02:07:34.180 --> 02:07:38.260
the name Arl Stein and yeah his books I used to read a lot of those and I read I

02:07:38.260 --> 02:07:41.260
read some other stuff too you should see the book that I finished in two days

02:07:41.260 --> 02:07:44.540
actually I liked a lot of even though I hear he was a total asshole I liked a

02:07:44.540 --> 02:07:47.620
lot of the rolled all stuff like Charlie Chocolate Factory in glass elevator and

02:07:47.620 --> 02:07:51.420
and James the giant peach and the boy I think the boy who ruled the world

02:07:51.420 --> 02:07:54.580
something like that well maybe if it's good I will loan you the book afterwards

02:07:54.580 --> 02:07:57.820
after my wife reads it cuz she's supposed to read it well hopefully

02:07:57.820 --> 02:08:01.900
somebody will buy me an iPad so I can play with gadgets when I read books it's

02:08:01.900 --> 02:08:04.740
not that I by the way it's not that I'm like reading sucks it's just that the

02:08:04.740 --> 02:08:09.880
internet has kind of like like instead of reading I pull up Wikipedia on my

02:08:09.880 --> 02:08:12.780
phone and I'm just looking at Wikipedia articles like that's kind of what it's

02:08:12.780 --> 02:08:16.100
turned into like my reading is now what attention span theater see the stuff

02:08:16.100 --> 02:08:22.000
that I've actually started reading it again lately is reading anthropology

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:27.740
studies I'm not I've never been a fan of historical fiction so I put down one

02:08:27.740 --> 02:08:34.820
historical fiction I was reading but I like I've been reading cultural books

02:08:34.820 --> 02:08:39.100
and the book I just finished was geisha by Liza Dalby she actually worked as a

02:08:39.100 --> 02:08:44.180
geisha in the 70s it's her doctoral thesis so that's what I've been reading

02:08:44.180 --> 02:08:47.220
lately it's not that I hate reading I just have a really short attention span

02:08:47.220 --> 02:08:51.100
but apparently it's good it is it is actually on the iOS bookstore whatever

02:08:51.100 --> 02:08:55.580
it's actually in what it's on the New York Times bestsellers list right now

02:08:55.580 --> 02:09:01.740
so okay if you like I mean that Kotaku actually was the one that kind of turned

02:09:01.740 --> 02:09:06.940
me on to that they ran an article about the book and with some screen it wasn't

02:09:06.940 --> 02:09:10.220
it was concept art I think for a screenplay because he's wrote a

02:09:10.220 --> 02:09:14.700
screenplay for it as well that will probably become a movie but well and I

02:09:14.700 --> 02:09:17.420
was wrong it's not that it sounds like spiral is that it sounds like the third

02:09:17.420 --> 02:09:23.060
book loop in the virus the ring the ring spiral and loop it sounds kind of like

02:09:23.060 --> 02:09:27.260
loop yeah but with video game references yeah all right let's get back to the

02:09:27.260 --> 02:09:32.900
emails here we go okay um the first one's from Holly we got two from Holly

02:09:32.900 --> 02:09:37.020
but they're short so Molly says you were forgiven PS I ate your Xbox connector

02:09:37.020 --> 02:09:41.380
cables what is that uh it was because Loki was talking about the dog but that

02:09:41.380 --> 02:09:44.820
was like a month ago remember Loki yeah I think about the dog's gonna die soon

02:09:44.820 --> 02:09:49.740
she sent us a picture terrible she sent us a picture of her dog oh I see the

02:09:49.740 --> 02:09:54.020
dog so come on I didn't say the dog would die soon and I hope it doesn't I'm

02:09:54.020 --> 02:10:00.940
just saying oh oh my god is it or a freaking corgi Molly I'm gonna put your

02:10:00.940 --> 02:10:06.420

02:10:38.200 --> 02:10:41.140
the next email I know this is like my fourth email this week but I'm just

02:10:41.140 --> 02:10:44.060
passing this on for your new segment this is a really clever way to get

02:10:44.060 --> 02:10:48.460
people to resub even though I had let my sub lapse because I'm playing Guild Wars

02:10:48.460 --> 02:10:51.900
right now I hopped right on this and reset when I saw it basically it's rift

02:10:51.900 --> 02:10:56.340
offering replies for the long replies rewards for the longer that you say

02:10:56.340 --> 02:11:02.900
subscribe in the form of gear Oh interesting so like here and not like

02:11:02.900 --> 02:11:09.220
pets and things that's interesting so like six months sanctuaries guard which

02:11:09.220 --> 02:11:15.140
is a helm you get a personal vendor which we've got one of those in our

02:11:15.140 --> 02:11:24.900
guild you get like some swords for 18 months you get gauntlets and greaves and

02:11:24.900 --> 02:11:30.020
tricorn of the drowned I'm gonna absolutely know whatever I mean is you

02:11:30.020 --> 02:11:35.060
and you get something called the endless skull helm that's just a cool name so

02:11:35.060 --> 02:11:40.460
yeah it's like basically there's an end to it that is false advertising stop

02:11:40.460 --> 02:11:44.620
moving on well hold on hold on guys say everybody wow does something kind of

02:11:44.620 --> 02:11:47.900
similar with the whole like anniversary gifts I mean but they're not like just

02:11:47.900 --> 02:11:52.380
for longtime subscribers I don't know I gotta talk about MMOs real quick though

02:11:52.380 --> 02:11:55.300
because and I'm just gonna totally publicly talk about a private

02:11:55.300 --> 02:11:59.260
conversation I don't even care me Glatov do you know what game he got for free

02:11:59.260 --> 02:12:05.700
from some little manager thing or whatever yeah Final Fantasy 14 what so

02:12:05.700 --> 02:12:09.060
he got it for free and he's been playing it remember how fun has he 14 like we

02:12:09.060 --> 02:12:13.020
all played it and during the beta we're like this game is shit but they I didn't

02:12:13.020 --> 02:12:17.980
they've tweaked a lot of stuff and he's telling me like it's more like 11 now

02:12:17.980 --> 02:12:26.300
but it's actually really pretty he's like you should play and I'm like but

02:12:26.300 --> 02:12:29.100
this is Shane we're talking about and he's really good at making people do

02:12:29.100 --> 02:12:32.860
things they don't want to do so I don't know maybe I will have to try it well

02:12:32.860 --> 02:12:37.220
hold on I'm just curious because you know it's kind of sucked and I'm

02:12:37.220 --> 02:12:41.900
wondering how much it's going for you know $25 on Amazon if I'm not mistaken

02:12:41.900 --> 02:12:48.700
and there's no monthly fee right now hmm really Oh Loki that Loki just went I

02:12:48.700 --> 02:12:53.980

in enough game yes on eBay there's I am looking on eBay I'm just saying 1298

02:13:01.660 --> 02:13:07.900
what used why would I buy a used copy of Final Fantasy 14 that's just stupid but

02:13:07.900 --> 02:13:18.260
I mean sorry you brought up MMO as I had to almost so oh this one's to me

02:13:18.260 --> 02:13:21.860

02:13:21.860 --> 02:13:25.340
really light this week not really the latest top 20 list from some of those

02:13:25.340 --> 02:13:28.940
lucky people who get paid to sit around all day talking PR crap and getting paid

02:13:28.940 --> 02:13:33.380
for it yes I'm jealous the headlines are focusing on the top three but I was

02:13:33.380 --> 02:13:37.580
interested by the PlayStation being placed at 13 and intended reaching 16

02:13:37.580 --> 02:13:41.900
with the Xbox not featuring is the Xbox really not cool apparently we don't

02:13:41.900 --> 02:13:47.980

02:13:51.660 --> 02:13:55.500

02:14:08.500 --> 02:14:14.660
Apple Harley Davidson Rolex banging Olafson Blackberry Google Ferrari Nike

would be epic all right let's move on yeah we got more emails okay a very

02:15:16.460 --> 02:15:22.980
feminine James Bond okay this comes from zither who zither is actually my new

02:15:22.980 --> 02:15:28.740
buddy now for introducing me to a different PC engine thingy so I listened

02:15:28.740 --> 02:15:32.380
to episode 428 recently and near the end dark soccer was talking about the PC

02:15:32.380 --> 02:15:36.820
engine and turbo graphics 16 emulation and mentioned magic engine I used to use

02:15:36.820 --> 02:15:40.180
magic engine to emulate but later I came across an emulator that's a lot better

02:15:40.180 --> 02:15:45.660
it's called Oh Taki oh it's oh oh ta ke and it was developed by Japanese guy

02:15:45.660 --> 02:15:48.780
from what I remember hearing magic engine has some input lag which is a

02:15:48.780 --> 02:15:53.620
common hindrance in emulators and Oh Taki Oh Taki has practically none at all

02:15:53.620 --> 02:15:56.860
plus it's free as opposed to magic engine where you have to pay I'd say

02:15:56.860 --> 02:16:01.180
it's very worthwhile emulator for the sole reason that it's free also I am

02:16:01.180 --> 02:16:05.300
with dark Sakura and hoping that planet Harriers can get emulated just recently

02:16:05.300 --> 02:16:09.460
someone managed to get Sega's model 3 hardware almost emulated and I hope that

02:16:09.460 --> 02:16:12.500
another James can crack the Hikaru and emulate it too you were gonna say

02:16:12.500 --> 02:16:19.740
something no I'm sorry I'm just Mouse being retarded no keep being one of the

02:19:38.460 --> 02:19:44.100
DTR freak domain name it would feel like I would be owning a piece of the past a

02:19:44.100 --> 02:19:47.140
relic from a different time when I was younger anyways at this point all of our

02:19:47.140 --> 02:19:51.300
posts on the form will be lost in time like tears in rain for the record

02:19:51.300 --> 02:19:58.940

02:19:58.940 --> 02:20:03.340
be terrible to like troll it and just put like coming back soon and then just

02:20:03.340 --> 02:20:07.820

see being let go of either but let it be known if they if they are you've got

02:20:11.220 --> 02:20:14.900
competition because if they do put that domain up for sale I want it and I will

02:20:14.900 --> 02:20:19.100

02:20:32.140 --> 02:20:36.980
forward I mentioned this a year ago when a backlog turned into 30-plus titles is

02:20:36.980 --> 02:20:42.420
it no longer a gaming backlog but a back jam and he shows us a picture of his

02:20:42.420 --> 02:20:50.340
plates and says DDR player that's great and my the plates on my car is still

02:20:50.340 --> 02:20:56.900
says DDR plyr but on my newer car 2010 Mazda mx-5 Miata shout out to all of our

02:20:56.900 --> 02:21:02.900
peace and triple-a I hope you have triple-a if you've got a Miata shit get

02:21:02.900 --> 02:21:10.660
some triple-a so yeah all right was that it for emails yes well if you want to

02:21:10.660 --> 02:21:15.100
make Jamie work mailbag at orange lounge radio.com send us more email I will cut

02:21:15.100 --> 02:21:19.740
a bitch if you yes we are reading emails again all right let's move on

02:21:19.740 --> 02:21:26.580
Loki okay look he's already trying to see if the domains available I know I

02:21:26.580 --> 02:21:31.260
know it's not somebody would have snatched up by now if it was there it is

02:21:31.260 --> 02:21:40.340
that's right anyways so let's talk a little bit about Sony and you know they

02:21:40.340 --> 02:21:46.740
have the phone brand Ericsson well they actually may be buying out Ericsson it's

02:21:46.740 --> 02:21:49.980
interesting this is coming from the Wall Street Journal and apparently they're

02:21:49.980 --> 02:21:53.460
gonna be buying out Ericsson the mobile phone company I guess they teamed up

02:21:53.460 --> 02:21:58.220
with back in 2001 and of course they just recently released the Xperia play

02:21:58.220 --> 02:22:06.300
through the Ericsson line and of course they're gonna have you know the new

02:22:06.300 --> 02:22:11.060
PlayStation Vita and the phone stuff and they're gonna have you know the store to

02:22:11.060 --> 02:22:15.820
go along with that well it's interesting because if Sony Ericsson you know

02:22:15.820 --> 02:22:22.460
becomes just Sony mobile then basically the first thing they would do is you

02:22:22.460 --> 02:22:27.380
have a PlayStation phone that's actually a PlayStation phone instead of just this

02:22:27.380 --> 02:22:32.220
experience player some roundabout weird name like that which people still dub it

02:22:32.220 --> 02:22:36.300
the PlayStation phone but if Sony actually has their own true phone company

02:22:36.300 --> 02:22:42.380
then our phone you know hardware manufacturer that'd be kind of neat

02:22:42.380 --> 02:22:47.820
they'd be joining up I guess against you know Apple even taking them on you know

02:22:47.820 --> 02:22:57.500
headfirst be interesting I don't know has it worked for the computers because

02:22:57.500 --> 02:23:04.780
they're damn fucking expensive yeah for real but apples are very expensive as

02:23:04.780 --> 02:23:12.540
well people buy those that's true this is about just having that status well

02:23:12.540 --> 02:23:16.220
there's a lot of games looking to be getting that same status as well you

02:23:16.220 --> 02:23:18.740
know you kind of heard why we are talk about a little bit when he was on the

02:23:18.740 --> 02:23:21.260
phone earlier is it sometimes it's kind of hard to get noticed and get coverage

02:23:21.260 --> 02:23:25.180
on a lot of the big sites well Activision is trying to help some indie

02:23:25.180 --> 02:23:29.340
games get exposure there's an indie games competition that they did before

02:23:29.340 --> 02:23:33.420
and I guess what happened is that the publisher is going to be doing this

02:23:33.420 --> 02:23:39.300
again offering two hundred and fifty thousand dollars to two indie developers

02:23:39.300 --> 02:23:43.620
ownership of submission rights will remain with the creator they're very

02:23:43.620 --> 02:23:48.220
important to put that in the press release and yeah there you go

02:23:48.220 --> 02:23:52.780
Activision is working with IndieCade to actually do the contest and it'll be

02:23:52.780 --> 02:23:58.940
open for submissions from now through December 31st that's awesome

02:23:58.940 --> 02:24:04.980
hopefully can oh maybe yyr should submit bungee ferret tossing as you know the

02:24:04.980 --> 02:24:13.180
future of gaming all right anyhow dark soccer what do you got for us well as I

02:24:13.180 --> 02:24:18.100
brought up earlier when I was trying to skip doing of a mailbag

02:24:18.100 --> 02:24:24.260
Minecraft has something new in it there have been screenshots released from work

02:24:24.260 --> 02:24:35.420
in progress version that has dragons dragons so it's either supposed to go in

02:24:35.420 --> 02:24:42.420
there or maybe not ever but the creator has been tweeting that texturing the

02:24:42.420 --> 02:24:49.100
dragon was interesting so it looks kind of blocky like everything in Minecraft

02:24:49.100 --> 02:24:57.780
does yeah dragons that's it all right it would be needs I guess I mean he keeps

02:24:57.780 --> 02:25:02.740
adding more and more things to kill you in the game so I kind of probably would

02:25:02.740 --> 02:25:11.940
impede on building stuff I would think the constant death my guess at least so

02:25:11.940 --> 02:25:15.140
this is also cool since we were talking a little bit about indie games and stuff

02:25:15.140 --> 02:25:20.340
on live is actually putting on some new indie games this fall and some of these

02:25:20.340 --> 02:25:24.820
actually might recognize because they've been hitting different console platforms

02:25:24.820 --> 02:25:29.620
as well as PC including orcs must die which was just released on Xbox Live

02:25:29.620 --> 02:25:39.380
Arcade limbo magica bastion space chem and Avadon the Black Fortress and those

02:25:39.380 --> 02:25:44.580
are on being added to already existing indie games that are on there including

02:25:44.580 --> 02:25:49.820
braid trying world of goo and the mall so that's kind of cool that there will

02:25:49.820 --> 02:25:57.580
be kind of a showcase of all sorts of games not just you know streaming games

02:25:57.980 --> 02:26:01.660
awesome it's good that on live is actually getting more games because

02:26:01.660 --> 02:26:05.020
that's kind of where they're hurting right now you know what I mean yeah so

02:26:05.020 --> 02:26:08.340
it's always a good thing just a couple more stories for you guys then we're

02:26:08.340 --> 02:26:12.020
going to go to the Twitter with twitter.com slash olr I haven't seen hardly

02:26:12.020 --> 02:26:16.180
anything show up on there so maybe after I say that it will or also there's going

02:26:16.180 --> 02:26:22.260
to be the skype line of course one eight seven seven game olr in just a moment I

02:26:22.260 --> 02:26:30.900
guess this is interesting I a study was done by website bundle who tracks credit

02:26:30.900 --> 02:26:34.620
card spending nice I'm sure that works but I guess they track all the

02:26:34.620 --> 02:26:40.020
transactions or whatever and what the study did is that it looked at it looked

02:26:40.020 --> 02:26:45.300
at games from EB and steam and GameStop and all these sales from July 2010 to

02:26:45.300 --> 02:26:50.740
June 2011 and looked at the top 100 cities in the US by population the city

02:26:50.740 --> 02:26:56.780
that bought the most games Huntington New York kind of random right yeah I

02:26:56.780 --> 02:27:01.860
mean that's I'm assuming that's upstate certainly not you know the big city but

02:27:01.860 --> 02:27:10.100
also in the list here locally at number five Modesto a laugh because like

02:27:10.100 --> 02:27:15.660
Modesto's like it's halfway between here and Fresno like what else can I say

02:27:15.660 --> 02:27:21.780
about Modesto was also on this you know what else was on the list Stockton was

02:27:21.780 --> 02:27:26.100
stocked on list of Fresno's it not like they have much to do there Sacramento's

02:27:26.100 --> 02:27:30.060
not even on the list a lot of these strike me as like suburb II things well

02:27:30.060 --> 02:27:33.780
then again Pittsburgh's like number six so there are Chesapeake Virginia's

02:27:33.780 --> 02:27:39.500
number four so there are some bigger cities that are on there I don't know

02:27:39.500 --> 02:27:43.180
interesting Denver Virginia beaches at ten those are aren't they like right

02:27:43.180 --> 02:27:47.580
near each other Miami think they are so there you go that's your list of game

02:27:47.580 --> 02:27:52.940
oh yeah Stockton number 41 hello Stockton so I guess those are the big

02:27:52.940 --> 02:27:56.700
cities that buy video games probably cuz there's nothing else to do and Rama says

02:27:56.700 --> 02:27:59.820
Huntington is Long Island thank you sorry we're California kids we don't

02:27:59.820 --> 02:28:05.460
know our East Coast geography as well Huntington is Long Island hmm all right

02:28:05.460 --> 02:28:09.100
one more one more story I threw this in here at the last minute because it's

02:28:09.100 --> 02:28:13.500
it's related to to music games and DDR which by the way I did a little research

02:28:13.500 --> 02:28:18.660
on the DDR freak domain it's registered through July 2017 so we won't be getting

02:28:18.660 --> 02:28:23.340
that anytime soon that's not surprising at all though I mean that site probably

02:28:23.340 --> 02:28:26.300
still generates quite a bit of traffic even though it's not there did it ever

02:28:26.300 --> 02:28:31.220
like come back up no or did the server get I know the servers are like getting

02:28:31.220 --> 02:28:35.380
unplugged or whatever yeah it's it's not back up it's still just the demo just

02:28:35.380 --> 02:28:42.420
goes to go daddy Wow and if you you know click on the the register it thing then

02:28:42.420 --> 02:28:48.220
it has you go to one of those buy out a used domain theme was it expiring anyway

02:28:48.220 --> 02:29:01.460
no I don't think so interesting we'll have to figure out what's going on huh

02:29:01.460 --> 02:29:07.020
all right well anyway this story is about a movie that's happening it's a

02:29:07.020 --> 02:29:12.140
3d movie and it's supposed to feature scenes from pump it up or whatever it's

02:29:12.140 --> 02:29:16.860
targeted at tweens and teens and it's supposed to be about dancing game and a

02:29:16.860 --> 02:29:21.500
girl who's bullied by her peers over I guess the lack of skills of the game

02:29:21.500 --> 02:29:25.980
it's gonna have its premiere at the end of October in Burbank California but

02:29:25.980 --> 02:29:30.620
like seriously look at this just look at this you guys based on true events

02:29:30.620 --> 02:29:33.940
you see what she's wearing right now I look so much better than her it's not

02:29:33.940 --> 02:30:02.940
even competition it's nothing personal super jets DX

02:30:04.740 --> 02:30:09.580
this whole thing looks like it was shot in front of a green screen

02:30:10.780 --> 02:30:14.220
you know what that looks like to me to be real like this is the arc music

02:30:14.220 --> 02:30:19.300
factory equivalent of movies is what this is and you just say enjoy your rep

02:30:19.300 --> 02:30:22.780
Rebecca black music on your way to watch this premiere if you go like I don't

02:30:22.780 --> 02:30:31.020
care that it's about a dance game it's only just kind of sad that's all so um

02:30:31.020 --> 02:30:40.900
yeah Alex terrible sure does all right well is it a world premiere if no one

02:30:40.900 --> 02:30:49.140
goes to see it it's a neighborhood premiere it's a street premiere all

02:30:49.140 --> 02:30:55.900
right moving on to our phone lines one eight seven seven game olr is the number

com slash olr and the first and only tweet so far comes to us from dark or

02:31:36.420 --> 02:31:40.540
dark Tetsuya not our Sakura she's here dark Tetsuya says on the topic of DDR

02:31:40.540 --> 02:31:44.500
freak have you heard about this reunion tournament thing they're doing I hope we

02:31:44.500 --> 02:31:49.060
can show support for him somehow uh good question I had heard there was supposed

02:31:49.060 --> 02:31:53.740
to be an event on 20 November is that even a weekend that this is happening

02:31:53.740 --> 02:31:59.900
20 November Thursday so it would have to be like 20 oh no I'm looking at 20

02:31:59.900 --> 02:32:04.820
November is a Sunday I'm all for it if they do a meet up on 20 November but no

02:32:04.820 --> 02:32:08.780
I haven't heard anything since the original Facebook poll so we need to

02:32:08.780 --> 02:32:12.460
look at Facebook and follow up on that I don't know but we'll find out that's a

02:32:12.460 --> 02:32:15.580
good question meanwhile let's go to the phones hire on

02:32:15.580 --> 02:32:20.920
orange launch radio who's this some Shane what's up Shane I didn't know what

02:32:20.920 --> 02:32:25.160
name I was gonna use so I changed it midway so sometimes sometimes we call

02:32:25.160 --> 02:32:31.980
you meekly top and now you're Shane Shane nothing I'm just enjoying Final

02:32:31.980 --> 02:32:35.820
Fantasy 14 right now did you hear did you hear us talking about that earlier

02:32:35.820 --> 02:32:40.020
no because your feed sucks tonight I it's not us I don't know what's going on

02:32:40.020 --> 02:32:44.100
we're trying all games I know but I'm still going but all games you know what

02:32:44.100 --> 02:32:46.980
they give it to us for free so if they have an off night I can't get to well

02:32:46.980 --> 02:32:57.380
you can get AIDS for free to use it Shane now that is a quote it does have a

02:32:57.380 --> 02:33:04.980
point you can get yours for free comparing yours with a pretty accurate I

02:33:04.980 --> 02:33:08.980
like yet you can probably get like Mexican labors for free you don't want

02:33:08.980 --> 02:33:15.420
them either Final Fantasy 14 you can pay 25 bucks for and yet now you say this is

02:33:15.420 --> 02:33:18.580
worth it I think you can actually get a little cheaper than that but yeah all

02:33:18.580 --> 02:33:22.220
right so fine you can get it on eBay or whatever but now you have come around on

02:33:22.220 --> 02:33:26.340
Final Fantasy 14 and you say Final Fantasy 14 is worth it yes it only took

02:33:26.340 --> 02:33:31.060
a year of them completely overhauling the game for it to be playable alright

02:33:31.060 --> 02:33:36.140
so how is this game gone from bad to good in your opinion well I mean it's

02:33:36.140 --> 02:33:42.740
turned into what it looked like from the get-go a Final Fantasy 11 clone and we

02:33:42.740 --> 02:33:49.460
played that for years and years and it it's fun I am enjoying my time I like it

02:33:49.460 --> 02:33:54.060
because it's got like a real story you get invested in and I keep deleting my

02:33:54.060 --> 02:33:58.060
characters and starting them over playing the intro areas because one of

02:33:58.060 --> 02:34:02.260
them is like so depressing at the end because this little girl has her father

02:34:02.260 --> 02:34:07.660
killed by one of these big ugly I forget what they're called like gob use or

02:34:07.660 --> 02:34:12.940
something from Final Fantasy 11 but because 14 had to take everything from

02:34:12.940 --> 02:34:15.860
11 and just change the name and that's how they were making it new and

02:34:15.860 --> 02:34:21.140
exciting right yep and they updated the graphics so it's pretty like I like

02:34:21.140 --> 02:34:24.100
making my character over and over again too because I can't decide on the hair

02:34:24.100 --> 02:34:28.800
color what's wrong with blue I thought you did blue everything nope nope they

02:34:28.800 --> 02:34:32.380
don't have a good color of blue so I went with brown but there's like eight

02:34:32.380 --> 02:34:37.140
different shades of brown so I keep starting and like oh this is good for

02:34:37.140 --> 02:34:44.700
five minutes but I need a different brown color so the game is fun huh yes

02:34:44.700 --> 02:34:48.280
that means they're gonna start charging for it soon probably not because I

02:34:48.280 --> 02:34:52.660
remember reading a quote saying that they would not start charging until the

02:34:52.660 --> 02:34:58.020
game was at the point that they wanted it to be at and recently with this new

02:34:58.020 --> 02:35:02.180
patch that came out this week they said that they feel the game is only halfway

02:35:02.180 --> 02:35:07.300
to that goal of being you know where they would want it to be as a playable

02:35:07.300 --> 02:35:12.820
game and that took a year so I'm hoping for another year free not paying for it

02:35:12.820 --> 02:35:17.980
every month and if it keeps up like that I'll continue to play and maybe if I get

02:35:17.980 --> 02:35:23.140
past level five and they got rid of the physical level so it's only one level

02:35:23.140 --> 02:35:28.300
your class level no longer like class for physical six or something stupid

02:35:28.300 --> 02:35:33.180
like that so maybe if I get past level five and I'll like it even more and I

02:35:33.180 --> 02:35:36.780
want to keep playing it cuz I mean it is technically one of the cheaper MMOs to

02:35:36.780 --> 02:35:43.900
play monthly it's only like 12 I guess but that mean what Wow's 15 most are

02:35:43.900 --> 02:35:47.000
priced in that area right how much is the Star Wars that memo gonna be do we

02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:50.740
know yet 15 they said per month unless you do like the same thing well does

02:35:50.740 --> 02:35:54.140
where if you pay for like six months at a time you get like for a dollar cheaper

02:35:54.140 --> 02:36:02.540
per month technically right isn't worth it live listeners um our feed went down

02:36:02.540 --> 02:36:05.820
but it's back up and that was us when amp crashed I don't know what it's

02:36:05.820 --> 02:36:09.500
probably got sick of all the delay stuff that's going on on the other side I

02:36:09.500 --> 02:36:12.740
don't know so I know you should just like let everybody call into Skype and

02:36:12.740 --> 02:36:19.220
then we could just listen that way party you have a Skype party um but anyway if

02:36:19.220 --> 02:36:23.140
we're done talking about that real quick I also wanted to mention that tap sonic

02:36:23.140 --> 02:36:27.220
has also been taking over for me really um they updated the free songs and they

02:36:27.220 --> 02:36:34.260
added some quote unquote American songs they're actually pretty fun to play like

02:36:34.260 --> 02:36:39.180
passion pits on there Gwen Stefani is on there and then some new kpop got added

02:36:39.180 --> 02:36:42.900
for free because I don't pay for stuff on that yet because I don't like micro

02:36:42.900 --> 02:36:46.740
transactions right and you have to pay like each time you play a song right

02:36:46.740 --> 02:36:53.820
yeah extra don't like that's dumb um and also technica threes soundtrack got

02:36:53.820 --> 02:36:58.660
leaked and it's all over YouTube and I love it is there anything I'd actually

02:36:58.660 --> 02:37:04.460
know huh is there anything I'd actually know in it uh it's got sampling masters

02:37:04.460 --> 02:37:10.140
in it they do a song but I guess one of the people from sampling masters has

02:37:10.140 --> 02:37:13.860
been the past few games and I didn't know that no but they put it like a lot

02:37:13.860 --> 02:37:17.380
of happy hardcore in there like stuff I could see I'm one of the happy to be

02:37:17.380 --> 02:37:22.940
hardcore CDs and it's really good and I love it all right well we're gonna

02:37:22.940 --> 02:37:26.780
invite keyboard lights up I got a new keyboard and it's changing colors a lot

02:37:26.780 --> 02:37:30.460
all right we're gonna let you go so we get some more calls here that's fine I

02:37:30.460 --> 02:37:34.140
just won't be able to listen to what you guys say after this well we had the

02:37:34.140 --> 02:37:40.780

hola bienvenidos a orange lounge radio who's this stunned into silence hang up

02:37:57.380 --> 02:38:01.300
there's a crank collar I guess they knew their connection wasn't working I don't

02:38:01.300 --> 02:38:07.220
know 1 8 7 7 game olr or a username on skype is orange lounge radio and in the

02:38:07.220 --> 02:38:12.180
meantime I'll try to go back to Twitter except I closed Firefox like a genius

02:38:12.180 --> 02:38:17.100
genius I guess we could have kept Shane on that you know be optimistic about

02:38:17.100 --> 02:38:25.260
things a little more I like Shane I like him when he's appropriate no I'm just

02:38:25.260 --> 02:38:28.220
kidding I guess isn't appropriateness is part of what makes him

02:38:28.220 --> 02:38:36.180
Shane right yep yes and you take your friends as they are or yes murder them

02:38:36.180 --> 02:38:41.820
in their sleep I mean you take them as they are all right let's go to our

02:38:41.820 --> 02:38:45.660
Twitter topics because I know we have at least a couple more coming in here now

02:38:45.660 --> 02:38:52.200
Tigerclaw sent us some tweets take down notice against some Battlestar Galactica

02:38:52.200 --> 02:38:58.900
modders this is a tweet a twink a tweet to us from Tigerclaw let's see a

02:38:58.900 --> 02:39:04.520
Battlestar Galactica mod for Nexus and I guess this made the attention of NBC

02:39:04.520 --> 02:39:09.560
Universal who sent a cease and desist letter to mod DB who'd been hosting the

02:39:09.560 --> 02:39:14.260
work on it I don't even wow I don't even know what this is about here but of

02:39:14.260 --> 02:39:20.500
course there is already a Battlestar Galactica online game so I'm sure this

02:39:20.500 --> 02:39:25.020
is definitely a conflict of interest when you put Battlestar Galactica into

02:39:25.020 --> 02:39:30.780
another game well it's also you know if you're doing a mod that's like with

02:39:30.780 --> 02:39:35.740
licensed properties and stuff like that I mean that's kind of to be expected if

02:39:35.740 --> 02:39:41.740
you know if you're doing your own mod or something like that you know and that's

02:39:41.740 --> 02:39:46.060
a little different by the way this game had to remove everything that was

02:39:46.060 --> 02:39:53.340
related to Battlestar Galactica so not just the popular one so bummer all right

02:39:53.340 --> 02:40:01.140
let's see also hold on why are you calling back I don't know you didn't

02:40:01.140 --> 02:40:07.420
have any other callers like I should tell time I just was slow in getting the

02:40:07.420 --> 02:40:12.740
Twitter loaded I don't think so no yes I was sounded like because I had the feed

02:40:12.740 --> 02:40:17.580
up and running and was the fees working now he was calling yeah if he was back

02:40:17.580 --> 02:40:23.940
well then there you go yeah so I called so Battlestar Galactica season to say I

02:40:23.940 --> 02:40:29.900
love that I'll start Galactica I know about that but as it has nothing to do

02:40:29.900 --> 02:40:35.220
with the story did you even hear the story yes okay what was the story

02:40:35.220 --> 02:40:40.140
NVC made them shut down some mod for some game that nobody plays okay good

02:40:40.140 --> 02:40:46.660
job you pass pass the test so are you sad that they had to take down the mods

02:40:46.660 --> 02:40:49.620
or you just I don't know how if you love Battlestar Galactica so much here's my

02:40:49.620 --> 02:40:52.900
real question if you love it so much why aren't you playing the MMO I did for a

02:40:52.900 --> 02:40:57.100
day and it was terrible really so I didn't play it anymore why was it

02:40:57.100 --> 02:41:02.900
terrible I couldn't control my Cylon ship and I was like this isn't realistic

02:41:02.900 --> 02:41:10.420
at all I'd be making out with helo or yeah that's really is awesome that's

02:41:10.420 --> 02:41:15.540
absolutely realistic I'm sure in bow star Galactica it would be because he

02:41:15.540 --> 02:41:22.260
loves Cylons and I was a Cylon all right all right I'm hanging up on you to get

02:41:22.260 --> 02:41:26.760
some other calls you're tying up okay if there are finally people calling by one

02:41:26.760 --> 02:41:32.340
eight seven seven game olr or username on skype is orange lounge radio so

02:41:32.340 --> 02:41:35.780
meletops gone and we do have another call coming in so let's see

02:41:35.780 --> 02:41:41.140
hi you're on orange lounge radio who's this oh it's legend of Zaku hey legend

02:41:41.140 --> 02:41:45.660
of Zaku how you doing pretty good been doing stressful at work but you know

02:41:45.660 --> 02:41:49.580
been hanging in there I hear usual it's been stressful my work too what's on

02:41:49.580 --> 02:41:56.300
your mind buddy just the usual you know grasp of the fact that um even though

02:41:56.300 --> 02:42:02.140
Steve Jobs did pass away it's like he his legacy in terms of how how he's

02:42:02.140 --> 02:42:07.140
actually laid out a plan that might actually impact the way we view you know

02:42:07.140 --> 02:42:11.060
any like portable dedicated gaming systems I'm just saying the fact that

02:42:11.060 --> 02:42:15.420
you know his passing is pretty much you know give me a little bit of time to

02:42:15.420 --> 02:42:19.700
reflect that mobile gaming might actually you know unless unless Nintendo

02:42:19.700 --> 02:42:23.740
gets into the business selling phones well Sony's getting there getting there

02:42:23.740 --> 02:42:26.940
as long as they buy out Erickson then they'll be set well but I'm more

02:42:26.940 --> 02:42:29.980
concerned about Nintendo and the fact that they just like shrug it off with a

02:42:29.980 --> 02:42:33.860
cavalier attitude if Nintendo you know started selling phones and they would

02:42:33.860 --> 02:42:38.500
have to acknowledge the fact that there's online and well exactly you know

02:42:38.500 --> 02:42:43.100
how that and this is and this is where you know these uh these mobile these

02:42:43.100 --> 02:42:47.580
mobile game developers they they target that audience where they're basically

02:42:47.580 --> 02:42:52.580
pissing in the same pool that Nintendo is you know spent hard cultivating ever

02:42:52.580 --> 02:42:56.660
since the game the days of the Gameboy but the idea is that they're going after

02:42:56.660 --> 02:43:02.860
the casuals I know it's a segment of the market that's like it's it's really hard

02:43:02.860 --> 02:43:06.540
to break in because these are people who aren't like you know they're just

02:43:06.540 --> 02:43:10.940
they're just typical folks they're not like your your average gamer you know

02:43:10.940 --> 02:43:15.940
but the idea is that Nintendo it's you know they have such they're just

02:43:15.940 --> 02:43:19.500
shrugging it off and they're good they're being so naive about like not

02:43:19.500 --> 02:43:23.920
adapting like not realizing that the guys who you know the creators of Angry

02:43:23.920 --> 02:43:27.780
Birds at the end of the day they're still gonna make bank while Nintendo is

02:43:27.780 --> 02:43:30.900
gonna be scratching their head as to why they're not innovating why they're not

02:43:30.900 --> 02:43:36.340
staying ahead of the curve and you can see as the Wii U you resolve the Wii U

02:43:36.340 --> 02:43:44.620
is innovative the Wii U it's about you and it's just a Wii with a you know with

02:43:44.620 --> 02:43:48.900
the touch remote and suppose it suppose it better graphics even though it's like

02:43:48.900 --> 02:43:53.060
it's still being worked out hold on hold on hold on hold on cycle hold that

02:43:53.060 --> 02:43:55.500
thought there's something really important I hate to interrupt our Sakura

02:43:55.500 --> 02:44:00.980
are you really reading about Final Fantasy 14 over there yeah I was curious

02:44:00.980 --> 02:44:05.140
oh dear it doesn't mean I'm gonna play it I was just looking you were

02:44:05.140 --> 02:44:08.100
experimenting did I catch you experimenting in the middle of the show

02:44:08.100 --> 02:44:13.740
I was just looking all right I had to give you crap all right sorry yeah it's

02:44:13.740 --> 02:44:18.900
like you know it's if Nintendo were really you know if they were serious

02:44:18.900 --> 02:44:23.300
about like trying to capture the the casuals they would have to like they

02:44:23.300 --> 02:44:27.100
they wouldn't just act like they wouldn't have like an arrogant tone and

02:44:27.100 --> 02:44:31.180
that's what I'm hearing you know that's what I hear from their bosses like they

02:44:31.180 --> 02:44:35.780
they hate the the guy they're hating on the folks who you know on the Angry

02:44:35.780 --> 02:44:40.300
Birds folks so the indie devs because at the end of the day who you know they're

02:44:40.300 --> 02:44:44.120
gonna be pissed when their lunch gets eaten you know by those guys Steve

02:44:44.120 --> 02:44:47.700
Steve Jobs his impact is gonna be felt for a long time and you know you were

02:44:47.700 --> 02:44:49.860
mentioning about kind of his style I think a little bit there at the

02:44:49.860 --> 02:44:52.500
beginning of the call did you hear that news report about that they're gonna

02:44:52.500 --> 02:44:58.540
have executives kind of be taught on his styles well that's the thing you can't

02:44:58.540 --> 02:45:03.900
really teach you can't really teach anyone else that type of style you know

02:45:03.900 --> 02:45:07.940
you're with that ability to be a perfectionist I can I got it you can't

02:45:07.940 --> 02:45:12.260
really teach an artist especially one that's born into it born with that

02:45:12.260 --> 02:45:15.900
talent I mean you're sure they can become artists and they grow to realize

02:45:15.900 --> 02:45:19.580
that they have the talent within them but you can't just force that person to

02:45:19.580 --> 02:45:24.180
be a perfectionist to be as as meticulous as he was I mean you're bad

02:45:24.180 --> 02:45:27.960
for that new guy a little the fact that he managed to change the you know my

02:45:27.960 --> 02:45:32.300
industry which I actually do work in mobile so I was you know I was you know

02:45:32.300 --> 02:45:36.020
the day that the day of the iPhone came out I realized that yeah I was gonna

02:45:36.020 --> 02:45:40.580
history was changing you know with that with that very same blow you never

02:45:40.580 --> 02:45:44.740
thought that we would go all the way from feature phones to high-end you know

02:45:44.740 --> 02:45:47.980
two smartphones that people could buy for the same price as they were paying

02:45:47.980 --> 02:45:51.660
for those shitty phones four years ago I gotta say though I I kind of feel bad

02:45:51.660 --> 02:45:54.580
for that new guy that came in and stepped in as CEO I mean I know Steve

02:45:54.580 --> 02:45:58.060
Jobs hand-picked him and I'm sure he's fine he's been he's probably really been

02:45:58.060 --> 02:46:00.900
doing a lot more of the work for the past couple years but if you think about

02:46:00.900 --> 02:46:05.660
it okay his first big press conference is about the iPhone 4s which is really

02:46:05.660 --> 02:46:09.260
yeah yeah that was shocking I mean it was the fact that they couldn't even

02:46:09.260 --> 02:46:13.900
like announce something greater than the iPhone 4 here's the problem I mean it is

02:46:13.900 --> 02:46:16.900
what it is if Jobs has still been around that would have been his announcement to

02:46:16.900 --> 02:46:21.060
make it I know but but think about this he knew Tim Cook had to know when he was

02:46:21.060 --> 02:46:27.100
up on that stage that the former CEO was I mean he knew I'm sure he knew the

02:46:27.100 --> 02:46:31.540
Steve Jobs was about to die well we actually well that was already known the

02:46:31.540 --> 02:46:35.380
day he stepped down and that was like you know that was months ago I'm talking

02:46:35.380 --> 02:46:43.860
the day tomorrow but the idea is that you know he said he paved the way in the

02:46:43.860 --> 02:46:49.460
in the fact that he that you know mobile mobile gaming has like explode in the

02:46:49.460 --> 02:46:53.900
past four to five years used to be a small niche market that only folks who

02:46:53.900 --> 02:46:58.300
had the money to to pay for those shitty you know games for for those devices

02:46:58.300 --> 02:47:02.180
back then but now it's like the quality is getting to the point where it might

02:47:02.180 --> 02:47:07.460
even rival whatever Sony and Nintendo is actually spitting out I mean if you look

02:47:07.460 --> 02:47:11.700
at the fact that these phones are like it's cheaper than the than the Vita

02:47:11.700 --> 02:47:16.180
itself that they start cheaper than the Vita and they had just about this you

02:47:16.180 --> 02:47:20.660
know just about the same number of games and the fact that the quality is damn

02:47:20.660 --> 02:47:25.980
near almost ps2 level first you know for for a device that you know no greater

02:47:25.980 --> 02:47:30.580
than four inches yeah that's pretty impressive hey hey hey hey all right all

02:47:30.580 --> 02:47:34.740
right Zach we're gonna let you go so we wrap up but um thank you for your call

02:47:34.740 --> 02:47:39.700
yeah anytime take care buddy all right I know he was definitely impacted by that

02:47:39.700 --> 02:47:42.780
because you know if you listen to show before Zach was called in before and he

02:47:42.780 --> 02:47:47.020
does work with mobile gaming and definitely we've seen more intervention

02:47:47.020 --> 02:47:50.700
come out of the mobile world from Apple than anywhere really I think and

02:47:50.700 --> 02:47:55.780
definitely not from Nokia all right that's gonna do it for calls tonight

02:47:55.780 --> 02:47:58.340
sorry to those that didn't get through it but be sure to send us an email for

02:47:58.340 --> 02:48:02.220
next week mailbag at orange laundry new calm or you could always send us a tweet

02:48:02.220 --> 02:48:07.260
twitter.com slash OLR um I want to quickly quickly read one more tweet here

02:48:07.260 --> 02:48:12.100
from Tiger Claw cuz I didn't get to this he sent a story from gamasutra about

02:48:12.100 --> 02:48:16.060
this is kind of a longer article but I guess the headline is game developer

02:48:16.060 --> 02:48:22.300
conference online web wise kids team for game promoting online child safety so

02:48:22.300 --> 02:48:26.220
web wise kids is the game or no as the company then I guess they're just

02:48:26.220 --> 02:48:30.200
promoting children being safe online I would assume like not sharing over

02:48:30.200 --> 02:48:34.580
sharing personal details and so forth I there is a free title that's saying is

02:48:34.580 --> 02:48:38.100
out there it's called passing the ball and it's an action game that follows a

02:48:38.100 --> 02:48:41.700
parent and their child as they learn an important lesson about working together

02:48:41.700 --> 02:48:46.540
I guess that it would be passing a ball which to me sounds a lot like you jump

02:48:46.540 --> 02:48:54.860
to a conclusion somebody will get the reference all right the reference all

02:48:54.860 --> 02:48:58.900
right thank you there is a donation link within passing the ball so you can make

02:48:58.900 --> 02:49:03.120
a donation to web wise kids and they will be doing something with the game

02:49:03.120 --> 02:49:07.380
developers conference event in San Francisco the initiative will include a

02:49:07.380 --> 02:49:13.200
one-day gamers for change event created by the same nonprofit team in addition

02:49:13.200 --> 02:49:16.180
to commissioning the game for web wide kids and adding the donate link to the

02:49:16.180 --> 02:49:22.700
game $1,000 was directly donated to this network to help the programs to promote

02:49:22.700 --> 02:49:26.660
a culture of safety responsibility and respect for youth and families in the

02:49:26.660 --> 02:49:32.260
digital world again watch your damn kids and make sure if they have a Facebook a

02:49:32.260 --> 02:49:37.320
they ought to be at least like 13 or 14 but B if they aren't you're monitoring

02:49:37.320 --> 02:49:40.540
it you know exactly what they're doing I have heard a really young permanently

02:49:40.540 --> 02:49:43.900
blind them I have well I have heard about really young kids with Facebook

02:49:43.900 --> 02:49:47.820
accounts mostly to play the games which is fine as long as the parent is kind of

02:49:47.820 --> 02:49:51.300
you know has watching out the corner of their eye you know what they're doing

02:49:51.300 --> 02:49:56.380
although I think standing there looking over their shoulder well yes and no I

02:49:56.380 --> 02:49:59.760
mean you can't put the child on it I mean at the at the end of the day it's

02:49:59.760 --> 02:50:03.740
up to the parent that's fine but I think and sometimes you should sit there and

02:50:03.740 --> 02:50:06.820
want to play the game with them but maybe there's times where you you kind

02:50:06.820 --> 02:50:10.060
of get it loaded for them and then you can walk away for a couple minutes give

02:50:10.060 --> 02:50:13.140
that child a sense of safety whatever make sure that when you walk back that's

02:50:13.140 --> 02:50:19.340
what they're still doing you know porn friends wanna porn Ville not porn Ville

02:50:19.340 --> 02:50:25.860
forget it all right there you go that's gonna do it for another week here at

02:50:25.860 --> 02:50:29.860
Orange Lounge Radio oh but I did miss one little little thing we got to do thank

02:50:29.860 --> 02:50:32.780
you Loki for pointing this out I totally missed this earlier what can I say I'm

02:50:32.780 --> 02:50:37.820
out of practice so it's time for the FUs of the week

02:50:37.820 --> 02:51:00.140
if you to people who don't do their damn part that's it fucking my crappy crappy

02:51:00.140 --> 02:51:07.140
crappy very very crappy firewall at work that doesn't allow us to play live very

02:51:07.140 --> 02:51:13.620
well because of our strict NAT settings and it's funny our I you know our IT guy

02:51:13.620 --> 02:51:20.580
actually opened the NAT ports for my system made it worse so that's great

02:51:20.580 --> 02:51:23.300
unfortunately they're gonna be installing a new firewall in a couple

02:51:23.300 --> 02:51:27.340
weeks and if that doesn't work he's gonna put our systems outside the

02:51:27.340 --> 02:51:33.980
firewall so that hopefully that won't be a problem all right a few to headaches

02:51:33.980 --> 02:51:37.340
I've been getting some huge ones today and it's just it's not been good I'm

02:51:37.340 --> 02:51:42.980
very sad but I did really wear myself out yesterday so that could be like part

02:51:42.980 --> 02:51:49.460
of the reason why so I don't know that's it for that fuse of the week now we can

02:51:49.460 --> 02:51:54.140
start to wrap up the show actually I got to ask Loki do you have any email last

02:51:54.140 --> 02:51:59.340
minute last minute stories for us no I'm not gonna look anything up fine then

02:51:59.340 --> 02:52:02.460
we'll go around and get everybody's final thought Loki will start with you

02:52:02.460 --> 02:52:09.020
my final thought is opening our opening on the 12th will be voting for the

02:52:09.020 --> 02:52:13.540
podcast awards so don't forget to vote every day every single day tell your

02:52:13.540 --> 02:52:20.060
friends tell your enemies just make sure you vote every single day and especially

02:52:20.060 --> 02:52:28.180
tell your frenemies yes my final thought is tacos if we win the podcast award we

02:52:28.180 --> 02:52:33.940
will celebrate with a taco party that's for sure is that your final thought

02:52:33.940 --> 02:52:41.580

wonderful night everybody thanks for tuning in and supporting orange launch

02:52:45.020 --> 02:52:48.380
radio show always do it hey if you like the show all we ask tell a friend about

02:52:48.380 --> 02:52:50.980
the show help spread the word remember guys we don't have advertising dollars

02:52:50.980 --> 02:52:54.780
it's part of the reason that we we were hoping we'd get nominated for the

02:52:54.780 --> 02:52:59.100
podcast award is because it's great exposure and you know we can't we don't

02:52:59.100 --> 02:53:03.500
have a big magazine or a giant website that backs us up so thanks again as
