My name is

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Stop trying to sound so hurt about it

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:22,000
My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining over the next few hours with my sometimes questionable co-host

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Hi

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
You know, it's almost as if you never left, we had such a derpy

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I heard about the derpisodes while I was gone

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Yes, we called them derpisodes

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I haven't heard, just like the podcast listeners which I apologize for in advance, I haven't heard last week's

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
But I heard about half of the one from two weeks ago on the commute to work

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
The one from two weeks ago was like two minutes

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Yeah, you guys just flew through the news

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
And I did like a bajillion hours to pump up the volume

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Not tonight though, oh my god we have a huge show tonight

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
We have like big announcements, big stuff to talk about tonight

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Of course I have to introduce the other guy here on the show, say hello to tech master Loki

34
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
And I'll have you know for the record, I'm always questionable

35
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
What?

36
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I can't wait to hear your last one

37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Oh you can be questionable, I'll just be questioning

38
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Huh?

39
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
What?

40
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Huh?

41
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Why?

42
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Why?

43
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Why?

44
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Okay, so yeah, I've been gone for a couple weeks

45
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And I gotta say, at first I apologize, especially the podcast folks

46
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Because the podcast feed is behind a week right now and that's pretty much my fault

47
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I've been extremely busy

48
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Now I know what you're gonna think though, like yeah, the reason why I miss the shows

49
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I went to a rock concert two weeks ago

50
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Look, it's a band I've missed like three times

51
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
And I said I am seeing Lady Tron this time come hell or high water

52
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
And it rocked

53
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
But they only want you when you're 17

54
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
And then last week, when you're 21 you're no fun

55
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Last week I went to Disneyland, I know rough life right

56
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
But I came back to just craziness at work

57
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
And I had this performance I was doing last night

58
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I participated in a local production of Repo the genetic opera

59
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Yes the movie, they do shadow casting for that now a la Rocky Horror

60
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Which as you guys may or may not know, Rocky Horror is kind of the reason

61
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I got into podcasting in the first place

62
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Because Rocky Horror led to Undersedation Live

63
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
The show I used to be on led to this show

64
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
So I still support actively the Rocky Horror community

65
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
And this show leads to neurosis

66
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I can talk about this now

67
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
There actually was a surprise cameo of the song Sweet Transvestite in Repo

68
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
So I played Riff Raff on stage but I had to keep it a secret

69
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I wanted to tell people I couldn't because it was all a surprise

70
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
And the crowd went wild and it was a great show man

71
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
When they did some of the killing scenes

72
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
They did that whole thing where the blood sprays out in the audience

73
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Over the first five rows, it was awesome

74
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
So big kudos to the folks here in SAC that made that happen

75
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
And my friend played Blind Mag

76
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Yes, she was phenomenal

77
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
She was really good

78
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Oh my gosh, I loved her, she was as they would say, fierce

79
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I didn't get to go last night, I wanted to

80
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
But she has that dramatic quality in life

81
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And I don't want to ruin the movie too much

82
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
But it's been out a few years now

83
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
She has a pretty dramatic death scene that's very over the top

84
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
And just awesome to watch

85
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
So, anyhow

86
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Only good role Sarah Silverman has ever done

87
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Wait, you mean Sarah Brightman?

88
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Sarah Brightman, why does it say Silverman?

89
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Sarah Brightman

90
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Keep in mind

91
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Were you thinking of your fellow Jews? Is that what it was?

92
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I guess so

93
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Yom Kippur has taken over your life

94
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
But Sarah Brightman, I've made no secret of this

95
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I think she's way too brassy as a soprano

96
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
And I know that Christine was for her for Phantom of the Opera

97
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
But you know what?

98
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Hate her in it, hate her, hate her, hate her, hate her

99
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
But she was really, really good as Blind Mag

100
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Yes, I agree

101
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
And to bring this back to games

102
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Repo, even though some people don't really like it as a movie

103
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
And say it's a terrible movie, because it is a little weird

104
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It's the guy who did Saw doing a rock opera

105
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
And like opera, meaning everything is a song

106
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
But Tony Head

107
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Anthony's to her head

108
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Hello

109
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
And it's told in that kind of comic book style

110
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
And it's just neat, it's something you should see

111
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Anyhow

112
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
And they should make a game out of it

113
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Back to video games for a minute

114
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Obviously this has been like everywhere this week

115
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
But we have to mention it, we have to

116
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Steve Jobs passed away this week

117
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
And it's kind of one of those things, it's insanely sad

118
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I know it's all been all over CNN

119
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
And especially all over Twitter and Facebook and so forth

120
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I know you guys have heard a lot about it

121
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
But how could we not tip our hat to Steve Jobs

122
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
And obviously, he did a lot for podcasting

123
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
He didn't invent podcasting

124
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
But definitely what happened with iTunes

125
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Propelled it into the stratosphere

126
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
And we have a lot to thank for that, for the exposure

127
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
And plus, it was called podcasting in the beginning

128
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Even before iTunes, because

129
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
And we were actually doing a show back before iTunes

130
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
That's how long the show's been going on

131
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Your old RSS would kind of

132
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
You could get these programs that would actually

133
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Still sync them to your iPod

134
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Because they weren't iPhones back then, but iPods

135
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
And you kind of sync it that way

136
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
And so there were ways to do what iTunes was doing before that

137
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
But it was always designed with that portable

138
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
On the go thing in mind

139
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I think it's important to mention, Steve Jobs contributed a lot

140
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
To things that don't even start with an eye

141
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
So regardless to how you feel about Apple

142
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Well, okay, I got one Apple thing I gotta say though

143
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Is that him and Woz did the Apple IIe

144
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
That was a huge thing

145
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
And that was like, hello childhood school

146
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
In the garage

147
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Well, the original Apple was in the garage

148
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
But yeah, that leads to Apple II

149
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Which is what we all, like anybody who grew up in the 80s

150
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
We all did

151
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
How many of us played Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego

152
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
On one of those rectangular bricks?

153
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Or Oregon Trail

154
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Or Math Blasters

155
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You know, that was a huge part of our education

156
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
And I think, you know, to me it was always like

157
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Really looking forward to Computer Lab Day

158
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I'm sure you other nerds feel the same way, right?

159
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
It was just like, Computer Lab Day was awesome

160
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
We didn't have computers in Alabama

161
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Really? Oh

162
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
No, we had like

163
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I actually believed you for a minute

164
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
We actually had one Apple IIe in the library

165
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Which I would just go play all the time

166
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
And then we had like the tall brick Macs

167
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
You know what I mean?

168
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Right

169
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
At a couple of the facilities that I used to do volunteer work at

170
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
And if it wasn't for him, we wouldn't have the MacBook

171
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
And we wouldn't have been able to upload the virus to the alien mothership

172
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
To save the world on Independence Day

173
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Absolutely, absolutely

174
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Very important contribution is that Steve Jobs

175
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Did contribute to saving us from virus

176
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Virus, Mac OS, same thing

177
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Even back in the day

178
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
The first really good graphics programs were developed on Mac

179
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
And that's why, I mean

180
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
And Macs were in schools everywhere

181
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Especially when you and I were growing up

182
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
And Loki, Macs were everywhere

183
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
In our schools

184
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
And that was a really smart ploy on Apple's part

185
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
But certainly you get attached

186
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I was in yearbook

187
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Which I know is something very similar to what you do now

188
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
You might not do yearbook, but you do publishing

189
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
And we did that shit on PageMaker on a Mac

190
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
It was good times

191
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
And now we're like, did you use PageMaker?

192
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
InDesign, hello

193
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
But yeah, but Adobe

194
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Even fully supported the Mac platform

195
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
For ages until they finally realized

196
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Oh yeah, PC's caught up, oops

197
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
And there was also the gaming connection too on the 2600

198
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Jobs had played a role in

199
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Breakout on the Atari 2600

200
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
That's one of the more kind of, I mean

201
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Woz talked about how he kind of got shafted

202
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
On the Atari bonus on that game

203
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
But regardless of all that

204
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
And how things went down

205
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
He did kind of have that more direct impact on the gaming industry

206
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
And I gotta say this you guys

207
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
This is the one that people forget about

208
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Not everybody, but some people have forgot about

209
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
CNN stuff, I think is the most important

210
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
In some ways, things that he did

211
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
He brought Pixar

212
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Back, and like, Pixar

213
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Is amazing

214
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
The movies they make and everything

215
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
If you hate every single Pixar movie that's ever been made

216
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I question your taste, I'm sorry to say

217
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
But like, you know, and I

218
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Pixar has made some that you may not like

219
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Like I know not everybody dug Cars 2 or Ratatouille

220
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Or A Bug's Life

221
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
But seriously, like, Wall-E

222
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Up, Toy Story

223
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
1, 2, or 3, take your pick

224
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
How often does a movie like that have so many great sequels?

225
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Right?

226
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I do have to say though

227
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Most CG movies today

228
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Are made in Linux-based programs

229
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Well, you know, but

230
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Whether it was Apple PC or what

231
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Jobs bought that company in the 80s

232
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
And had that vision of making

233
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
An animated movie out of computers

234
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
And, you know, a lot of people kind of pass that off

235
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
And there's still some today

236
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
That kind of feel that, well, traditional animation is best

237
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
And, you know, I think

238
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I think we're getting to a place where you get

239
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
A good mix of the two, like there's been some great

240
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Traditionally animated ones, like I like Princess and the Frog

241
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
An awful lot, but

242
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Boo!

243
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
What, you don't like that movie? It was terrible

244
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I haven't seen it. I thought it was great. Hater.

245
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Alright, but then there's some, you know, obviously the stuff

246
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Pixar does, even up through like Tangled

247
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Were really, really good movies, even though I know Tangled

248
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Was not technically Pixar, but

249
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I mean, you look at DreamWorks

250
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Look at any of them, I mean, basically

251
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Pixar really innovated the

252
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
The genre

253
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
So, um, so yeah

254
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
A tip of the hat to a guy

255
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Who, um, was very sassy

256
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Too, like in the way he ran his company

257
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Was very unlike other CEOs

258
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
So, a tip of the hat to Steve Jobs

259
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
And rest in peace

260
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Sadly, I think we all kind of, I mean

261
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
When it happened, it was like, oh wow, but I think we all

262
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Kind of, you know, we all kind of knew

263
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
When it happened, I was like

264
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Oh, it finally did, because he had been

265
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Very holistic in his approach

266
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Towards his cancer treatment

267
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
And while I'm a big fan

268
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Of holistic treatments

269
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
For something like that

270
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I don't condone it

271
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Well, and he had issues

272
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
No matter what you believe in

273
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
He had issues with his pancreas

274
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
And you just, the pancreas is like your heart

275
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
If it gets damaged, you can't live without it

276
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
And, you know

277
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
In some ways, this kind of new strikes

278
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Close to home, because you guys may or may not remember

279
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
If you've been listening long enough, back in 2008

280
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I had a pretty serious medical issue that

281
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Took me out of the show for a few weeks, and it was pancreatitis

282
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
And it's no joke

283
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
And I was very scared there for a minute

284
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
When they had to do the MRI on it

285
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Because they told me flat out they had to rule out

286
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Pancreatic cancer, because I had a growth on my pancreas

287
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Thank heavens it was just a cyst

288
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
So, you know, I

289
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Absolutely feel, and I know it had to be

290
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
A great deal of pain

291
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
And now it's been stopped and desisted

292
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Well, in his case, you know

293
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I meant for you. Oh, for me?

294
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Stopped and desisted

295
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Oh, I get it, desisted, har har

296
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
But no, at least for him, he's not in pain anymore

297
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Like, he was up on the stage as late as

298
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
What, April? He did that?

299
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
The Stanford thing too

300
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
That was before, but yeah

301
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
But April was the whole iCloud thing

302
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
And so, you know, he was on stage for that

303
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
So when you consider that was six months before

304
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
He ultimately passed away

305
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
You know, I'm just glad he's not in pain anymore

306
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
And I hope his family and all that

307
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Is doing

308
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Okay

309
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Alright, so on to

310
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I'm just gonna turn the car, complete 180

311
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Like really, really sad news to really

312
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Alright, we're going back

313
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Now we're going to Disneyland, everybody

314
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
So

315
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
We mentioned a couple weeks ago

316
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
On the show that we really appreciated

317
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
If you guys would nominate us for the podcast award

318
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Which we won back in like 2005

319
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
But I don't even think we've been nominated since

320
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Maybe like one time, I don't remember

321
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
But it's mostly been, especially in those first

322
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Couple years, 06, 07

323
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
A lot of like the corporate cast

324
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
And you know, a

325
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
nomination in there would go a long way towards

326
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Exposure for the show and everything and

327
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Oh my god, we got nominated, we did

328
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
It was announced yesterday, we got nominated

329
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Podcastwords.com if you want to check it out

330
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
It's amazing

331
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
And what's really amazing, I'm gonna be honest

332
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
You know, the other shows that are nominated

333
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Like, I think all but one

334
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Or maybe two of them are indie shows

335
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
You're talking like ten shows

336
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
And there's some awesome indie shows in there

337
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
And so I feel very confident

338
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
That some indie is gonna

339
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Walk away with it

340
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
And that's great, you know

341
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
And indie's gonna be getting the exposure

342
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Although I'd rather be our indie show

343
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Well sure, not gonna lie

344
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
It would be awfully nice

345
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
No, I want us to be nominated just to lose

346
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
It would be awfully nice

347
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
But, you know

348
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
If you don't vote for us, we'll eat wet cigarette butts

349
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Don't care

350
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
We'll throw a protest, no

351
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Obviously we would love a vote

352
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
And voting opens on the 12th

353
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Podcastwords.com

354
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
It's this interesting thing where you have to vote every day

355
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
So please vote often

356
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
And yeah

357
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
We would really appreciate it

358
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
That would be great

359
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
But win or lose, we're gonna just keep doing what we always do, right kids?

360
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Yeah, being awesome

361
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I'm gonna quit if we lose

362
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I'm done, stomp

363
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Alright

364
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Let's move on and talk about

365
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
We gotta get back to video games

366
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Let's talk about our gaming weeks

367
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
And the stuff that we have been playing this week

368
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
So DarkStalker, we'll start with you

369
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
How was your gaming week?

370
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I really haven't played much of anything

371
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I mean, just because I've been super busy with school

372
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Excuses, excuses

373
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I was on, well, just long enough to do dailies

374
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
And that's it, really

375
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I mean, I did like one instance

376
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
But like, yesterday

377
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
It was Yom Kippur

378
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Oh yeah

379
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Honestly, I have to say that it was

380
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
You know, people complain

381
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
About fasting

382
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
And oh, I'm so tired

383
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
But for me, it was actually kind of good to step away from everything

384
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Is Yom Kippur like no technology, either?

385
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Well, on top of that, it was on a Shabbat, regardless

386
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
So that means that

387
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Technically, if you're gonna observe it, then yeah, no

388
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Nothing creative

389
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
No Facebook, no games, nothing creative

390
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
No writing

391
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
You read Torah, you read commentaries

392
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Oh, okay, I was like, are you allowed to read on the Kindle?

393
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Only if it's a Torah?

394
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Oh yeah, I guess if I was reading Torah, commentary on the Kindle, I could do that, yeah

395
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
But I mean, it's

396
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
But for me, it was just sort of like

397
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Stepping away from everything

398
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
You know, I turned off my phone

399
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I turned off my computer

400
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
You know, I

401
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
And yeah, the fasting thing is never fun

402
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
But

403
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I spent a lot more time around people

404
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I gotta say

405
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
You know, my friends, some of my friends

406
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
And I used to do a trip

407
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Sadly, we don't do it anymore

408
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
We used to do a trip every year to Mendocino

409
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Off the grid

410
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Because you literally don't have cell service when you're that close to the ocean

411
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
And you know, just

412
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
It was actually a really neat trip

413
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
And it forced me to get away from all that and just be with people

414
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Which was great

415
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
So I have to say that actually

416
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
It's been a good week of disconnecting

417
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
From

418
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
The games and the internet

419
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
So your gaming week has consisted of

420
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Being anti-technology

421
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
It was a vacation

422
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
And then I found a game that I totally

423
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Have to have

424
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
And that's that Kirby

425
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
10 Kirby game

426
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Where it's like Kirby's broken up into 10 parts

427
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
And you have to find all of his parts

428
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
And then you attack things by throwing a bunch of Kirby's at it

429
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I want that game

430
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Mass attack, that's it, I want that game

431
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Go get it!

432
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I broke

433
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I will fill in for your gaming week then

434
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Since you were on a religious observance

435
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
And so forth through the week

436
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
What some folks in chat have been playing

437
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
YYR in our chatroom says

438
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I bought a Turbo Duo with 11 games

439
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Not that I have much less played or anything

440
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Because this show is rated TG-16

441
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Um

442
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
And Tidalitis

443
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Hope I said that right, said my gaming week

444
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Street Fighter III Third Strike Online

445
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Bought DJ Hero 2 on a whim at Big Lots

446
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Well if they were selling it at Big Lots

447
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
That means it was probably 10 bucks

448
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Hence why he probably got it on a whim

449
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
It's a good whim

450
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I think DJ Hero is a pretty underrated series

451
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
It's unfortunately like

452
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
The other music games that I played

453
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I buy it

454
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I get all excited about it, play it a little bit

455
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
And then it goes away for a while

456
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
But then eventually once I have

457
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Nothing to do

458
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I'll go back and play it again

459
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
It didn't have fabulous longevity

460
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
And I think the fact that it has such a large controller

461
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
That you have to kind of like put away

462
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Then get out, plug in

463
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I think honestly when people want to play

464
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Sometimes they just want to turn on the system and go

465
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
So I don't know

466
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
But yeah, DJ Hero at least was a great game

467
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Alright Loki, how was your gaming week?

468
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Uh, it was pretty good

469
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I played a few things

470
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Grand Theft Auto, barely

471
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Because our firewall has been

472
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Absolute shit

473
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Apparently Microsoft went down

474
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Live went down for a little bit

475
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
On Monday

476
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
And for some reason after that

477
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Our firewall has been just absolute shit

478
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
We were lucky to get 4 out of the 5

479
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Consoles connected to live

480
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
In a game together

481
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
And actually be able to stay in

482
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
It has been more of like

483
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Oh, let's see whose console stays online

484
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Long enough for us to fish the game

485
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
And sometimes only two of them

486
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
So it kind of sucked

487
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
But it's still

488
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Sorry, we played a little bit of that

489
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
And then played a little bit of Earth Defense Force

490
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Just doing some farming for my

491
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Jet Trooper guy

492
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
And then the new game that I played this week

493
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Was Dead Rising 2 Off the Record

494
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Which I was really excited about that

495
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
And it's a pretty awesome game

496
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:41,000
The only disappointment I have with the game is

497
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Dead Rising 2, one of the things I hated

498
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Was the fact that you have to keep going back

499
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
To give your stupid daughter zombrex

500
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I was like, cool!

501
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Dead Rising 2 Off the Record is gonna be

502
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Dead Rising 2 is gonna be awesome

503
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Because you don't have to do that anymore

504
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
No, this time

505
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Frank West is infected

506
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
And he needs to take zombrex

507
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
So I was like

508
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Aw, come on!

509
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Thankfully, when I did that

510
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
When I got to that point

511
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I was like, aw, come on!

512
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I switched right over to sandbox mode

513
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
And there's none of that shit

514
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
So it's just killing zombies and that's it

515
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Funny enough, the way the beginning of that

516
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Is this game already out or is it coming out?

517
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
It's coming out

518
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
So the way it kind of begins in the sandbox mode

519
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
He's being dropped out of a helicopter

520
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Much like the first game

521
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
And they're all, so are you covering your next big scoop here?

522
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
He's all, no, not this time

523
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
This is my vacation!

524
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
And doesn't roll onto the roof

525
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
And then just starts killing zombies

526
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
But everything transfers back and forth

527
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Your experience and costumes

528
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
And crap that you get

529
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
So right now I went through a sex shop

530
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
So I had a bunch of

531
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Weird

532
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Village people-esque

533
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Stuff on

534
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
You know, when I think of the village people

535
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I don't necessarily think of sex

536
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Well chaps, okay

537
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Maybe it's a generation thing

538
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Nah, it's more like leather chaps

539
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Alright

540
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Just for whatever reason

541
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I was just picking up all the clothes on the way

542
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Whatever ends up happening, that's fine

543
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
But now I have this weird mask and bull horns

544
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
On my head, so

545
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Not gonna lie, I always got the biggest kick out of playing a furry

546
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
And moisturizing and putting on the big furry costume

547
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Haven't gotten there yet

548
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
But it is pretty fun

549
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Yes, I'm a furry

550
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Virtually

551
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
But it's nice to be able to do

552
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
The photography stuff

553
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
And Frank

554
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Even in the main story mission

555
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Which I'll probably go back to that

556
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
It's still pretty funny

557
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Because the dialogue

558
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
And stuff's a little bit different

559
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
But a lot of the stuff that happens in the game

560
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Is similar

561
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
It'll be interesting to see how the game plays out

562
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
So I'd recommend picking up

563
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Especially since it's not even a full price game

564
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
It's just 40 bucks

565
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Only?

566
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
It's like Dead Rising 2

567
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
But better

568
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
It's priced where most games ought to be in my opinion

569
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
But anyway

570
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Definitely worth picking up

571
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
That's pretty much all I've played this week

572
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Alright

573
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Well hey, let's go to my game of the week

574
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
No I'm sorry

575
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
One last thing

576
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Burnout Crash played that a little bit

577
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
And that's actually pretty fun

578
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Despite the fact that I really hated the idea of a top down burnout

579
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
But it's actually a pretty fun game

580
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Alright, you done?

581
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I'm done

582
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
You sure?

583
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
So I haven't played a whole lot of games

584
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Especially this week

585
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I already told you guys I've been busy as hell

586
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Besides the Disneyland games

587
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I gotta go to Flynn's Arcade because Electronico is back

588
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
And play some classic games there

589
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
They didn't mix them up a little bit

590
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I noticed some games were gone

591
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
But I play stuff like Frogger that's always there

592
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
And I also, you know, of course

593
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Midway Mania

594
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Which is a lot of fun

595
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Came back and I've played, of course, a lot of Warcraft this week

596
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
As far as other games

597
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
That are not things I've already talked about on the show before

598
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I took an opportunity

599
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Since we were just talking about game pricing

600
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I took an opportunity to pick up the latest

601
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Humble Bundle

602
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
And if you didn't know

603
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
There is the Humble Frozen Synapse Bundle

604
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Going on right now

605
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
And that is where you basically pay

606
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
What you want for the game Frozen Synapse

607
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
And it comes with

608
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
The game Spacechem as well

609
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
And if you're not familiar with Humble Bundle

610
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
They just had one of these

611
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Not even a month or two ago

612
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Because I remember that's how I got VVVVV

613
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Was in one of these Humble Bundles

614
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
It's a very interesting

615
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
New way to price

616
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Games

617
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Where people can kind of pay what they want

618
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
And these games are not necessarily

619
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
New, but

620
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
They're, you know

621
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Good games

622
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
And I think something a lot of people

623
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
May not have given another look

624
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
If they didn't have this whole pay what you want thing going on

625
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
And I think they're making pretty good money

626
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Off of it and a chunk of it goes to charity

627
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Which I think is great

628
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
And it's not just Spacechem either

629
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
If, well hold on I want to put this out

630
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
So if you spend more than the average

631
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Which right now is $4.75

632
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
You get some other games as well

633
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
You get Shadow Grounds

634
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
You get Shadow Grounds Survivor

635
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I think these other games were

636
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Only with pre-order

637
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I don't think you get them anymore

638
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
You get the game Trauma now too I think is thrown in there

639
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
And the one other game I want to mention

640
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Because this is the one I played, Trine

641
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Was in the bundle as well

642
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I think Trine was on Xbox Live Arcade

643
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I overlooked it, I never played it

644
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
So I'm playing it now on PC for the first time

645
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Because I paid more than the average so I could check it out

646
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
It's pretty cool, I like it

647
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
When I was reading the description of it

648
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I didn't quite understand it

649
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
But now that I'm playing it I'm like oh okay

650
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
So it's like a puzzle game

651
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
But you can automatically switch between a warrior type

652
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
A thief type and a wizard type

653
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
But when I say a puzzle game

654
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I'm talking like a side scroller

655
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
So it's like Mario-esque I guess you want to say

656
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
But when you switch to the wizard

657
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
The warrior can draw blocks or he can levitate blocks

658
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
The thief has a long range attack

659
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
And can use a grappling hook

660
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
The warrior has a short range attack

661
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
And can use a shield

662
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
And you literally hit one button to switch between

663
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Because the story kind of goes that all three of them

664
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Find this magical item

665
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
That they get attached to

666
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Because usually the thief and the warrior

667
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Would not be getting along

668
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
And the mage and the thief would be having this weird

669
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Thing going on

670
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
So the item binds them all together

671
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
And so now their souls are all shared or whatever

672
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
So they're going on this adventure to remedy that

673
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
And find treasure along the way

674
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
So that's basically the premise of the game

675
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
So you hit one button to switch between all these different types

676
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
So I think it's cool

677
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
And the other thing I love about these Humble Bundles

678
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Is that they come with a key

679
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
So you can play them in Steam

680
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
So you buy the thing loaded in Steam

681
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Now you have all the Steam achievements

682
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
People know what I'm playing

683
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Can compete against me and all that good stuff

684
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
So

685
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
For the low low price of whatever

686
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
It's great

687
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
But again I would recommend you

688
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Not be totally cheap

689
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Spend let's just say five bucks at least

690
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
And get the other games as well

691
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
And if you're having a good week give them ten

692
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
It's a good cause

693
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Or whatever you think these games are worth

694
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
So yeah that's at HumbleBundle.com

695
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
And trying alone was worth it

696
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
I gotta admit I tried

697
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
I was gifted a copy of Frozen Synapse

698
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
About two weeks ago

699
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
And Steam was having

700
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
A buy one get one free sale

701
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Where people could give the codes to other people

702
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
And somebody was kind enough to give me their code for Frozen Synapse

703
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
I gotta admit

704
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
I didn't get it at all

705
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
I think I just need to try again

706
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Sometimes you have to be in the right mindset

707
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Have you guys ever had that?

708
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
You have to just be in the right mindset to enjoy a game

709
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Sometimes you'll sit down and play it once

710
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
And you're like I don't get it

711
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
But then you go back a month later and play it again

712
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
And you're like oh man what was I missing

713
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Which is why I don't think I ever reviewed it on the show

714
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Cause I knew I wasn't really prepared to talk about it

715
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Oh did Dark Soccer just buy the HumbleBundle?

716
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Yes it did

717
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Alright

718
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
I think you'll like trying

719
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
I'm not gonna buy this one because I haven't even played through more than one game

720
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Out of the last bundle I bought

721
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
But didn't you play VVVVV until you beat it?

722
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Yes

723
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Until I beat it but not 100%

724
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Because I still have one more

725
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Shiny object to get

726
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
And I just want to rip my hair out

727
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
If I'm supposed to get that

728
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
It's annoying

729
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
I mean I get it

730
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
It's supposed to be hard

731
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
But I don't want to play it anymore

732
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Because it's so hard

733
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
I'm not gonna come back to it

734
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Cause I know what happens if I get it

735
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
It just flips the damn game upside down

736
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Spoiler

737
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
And you play the same thing again

738
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
No it's still the same fucking game because you flip up and down

739
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
It's not like Castlevania

740
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I get what you're saying

741
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
But up until you get to that point

742
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
It's an amazing game and the music is amazing

743
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
No it's an amazing game I love it

744
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
It's such a simple concept

745
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
It's just like

746
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
I know alright alright

747
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
But anyway I think

748
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
You should play Trion on 360

749
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Cause I think a lot of people may have already played it

750
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
I would say that alone makes the set worth it

751
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
But you know

752
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Check it out

753
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Frozen Synapse I think is a bit more of a strategy game

754
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Also comes with soundtracks in the editor

755
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
I haven't even picked that up

756
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
See you know what I just picked up my steam code

757
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
And went to town

758
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Yeah

759
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
There you go

760
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Salacious Pop is reminding me in our chatroom

761
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Trion is also gorgeous

762
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
I'm doing this in the name of Orange Jones Radio

763
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Even though I just put 10 bucks

764
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Well still

765
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Let's see

766
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Trion is very gorgeous at least on the PC

767
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
I haven't seen it on 360 so I can't compare

768
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
But it is a very good looking game

769
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Very cartoony lush lighting effects

770
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
It is a really good looking game

771
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
And very smooth on my computer

772
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
And I'm playing it in like 1680 by 1050

773
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Widescreen

774
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
In high quality so

775
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
It's great

776
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Yeah actually Salacious Pop may not even know

777
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I didn't even have the graphics on their highest setting

778
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
I had it on high not very high

779
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
So maybe I'll have to try again later with the very high

780
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
So anyway that's pretty much my gaming week

781
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
So I think we will move on

782
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
To gaming news and talk about all that

783
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
With you guys in our chatroom

784
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
I guess I can quickly mention once again

785
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Please follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash o-l-r

786
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
We also have a Facebook at facebook.com

787
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Slash orange launch radio

788
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
This is also the part of the show where I will mention

789
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Any housekeeping like upcoming shows that we're missing

790
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
And what have you

791
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
I'm stuck for the rest of the year

792
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
I don't see myself missing any shows

793
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
You know something unforeseen may always come up

794
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
I'm missing one in a few weeks

795
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
That's right Dark Soccer you are leaving for a week at the end of the month right?

796
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
I will be gone on the 23rd

797
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
So hopefully we'll have a guest host

798
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Just like you guys had Dan here when I wasn't here

799
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
And we'll move on

800
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Alright let's get into some gaming news

801
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Loki start us off what's up

802
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
So PlayStation 2 games

803
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
As we've kind of thought for a while

804
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Are going digital

805
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
In this new only on PlayStation Network campaign

806
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
They're going to be doing

807
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Every Tuesday this month

808
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
They're going to have a new

809
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Exclusive selection of rare

810
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Classic games

811
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
God Hand, Grim Grimoire, Maximo

812
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
And Odin Sphere

813
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
And Ring of Red

814
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Um

815
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
And I guess you know of course they

816
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
They're old PlayStation 2 games

817
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
They've done nothing to them no updates

818
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Or whatsoever they just play now

819
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
On the PlayStation 3

820
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
And um

821
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
I guess um

822
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
PlayStation Plus members get them at

823
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
A 20% off discount

824
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
During the launch week

825
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
And if you spend more than $60

826
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
In October you'll get a $10

827
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Credit for November

828
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
So um

829
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Interesting

830
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
I guess they're saying there's also

831
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
A lineup of PlayStation Network exclusives

832
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Now these aren't necessarily

833
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
These are actually not

834
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
PlayStation 2 games but

835
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Euphoria and

836
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Rock Hard that was actually

837
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
This week on the 4th

838
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Next week on the 11th Sideway

839
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
New York on the 13th

840
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Sodium Collection

841
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
If it's sodium

842
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Might as well forget about it

843
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
18th Okabu

844
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
And Rocketbirds

845
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
And then on the 25th the expansion for

846
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Infamous 2, Infamous Festival Blood

847
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
And Pixel Junk

848
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Side Scroller

849
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
But all I gotta say is

850
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Yeah thanks Sony you figured out a way

851
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
To play PlayStation 2 games on your PS

852
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
On your PS3 systems

853
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
But you don't do a free update

854
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
For everybody so they can I don't know take their old games

855
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
That they have and make everybody happy

856
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Because they have backwards compatibility

857
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
No you decide to sell them on the marketplace

858
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Figures

859
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
I'm trying to give Sony the

860
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
The

861
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Whatever you call it I have a headache

862
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Thank you the benefit of the doubt

863
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
I'm trying to give Sony the benefit of the doubt right now

864
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
And the whole

865
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Backwards compatibility thing and I'm trying to think

866
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Ok what is the reason why

867
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
You couldn't just put a disc into the PlayStation 3

868
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
It's because they had an entire PlayStation 2

869
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
In the PlayStation 3 originals

870
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Right?

871
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
That emotion chip or whatever it was called in the PlayStation 2

872
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Right?

873
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Then eventually they got rid of it

874
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Have they emulated that?

875
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Well then they got rid of one of the chips

876
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Remember that's why the backwards compatibility got cut a little bit

877
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
But then they also were able to cut the price by a hundred bucks

878
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Yes and then they got rid of both chips

879
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
But now they have

880
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Obviously an emulator because this is the way

881
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
That the PlayStation 1 games work

882
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Because it's all emulation

883
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
So now they have an emulator that works

884
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Or some way obviously that's able to do this stuff

885
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
And

886
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
They just

887
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
I know what you're doing

888
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Here's my other question

889
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Ok the whole benefit of the doubt thing

890
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Is it maybe a situation similar to

891
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Xbox 360 and original Xbox

892
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Or maybe their emulator doesn't emulate

893
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Everything and that's why they don't want to open it up

894
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Because maybe it can't play the big big games

895
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Like I mean you got a lot of neat games

896
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
In this original launch here

897
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
But let's be real it's not like you have

898
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Your Final Fantasy X

899
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Your Grand Theft Auto Vice City

900
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Well yeah they're doing

901
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Just rare

902
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Classic games right now like God Hand

903
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Like real niche stuff

904
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
That nobody maybe bought the first time

905
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
These I can guarantee aren't

906
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
All in the same engine

907
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
That's kind of how the Xbox backwards compatibility

908
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Worked is they were trying to get

909
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Everything to work correctly and you'd see

910
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Like a big lot of games that were

911
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
All you know part of the same

912
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
You know engine game engine

913
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
They were running on that's why all these games

914
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
All of a sudden became available

915
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
That's why you got the Barbie Horse Adventures and you know some other

916
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Good games

917
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
It

918
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
It's because they lost

919
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
It's because they lost a lot of money

920
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
When the Playstation Network went down

921
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
And they need to recoup that

922
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
That's why they're selling them

923
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
I did notice

924
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
That there was very little fanfare about this

925
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
You know what I mean like we've been building

926
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Up to this for a long time remember about two years ago

927
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
There were the whole rumors about the Dreamcast

928
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Things were going to be coming and

929
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
I don't know but those already have

930
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
No but there was something else about like

931
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Around that same time like Playstation 2

932
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Games were supposed to be opened up

933
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Like there was a whole thing in that memo or whatever

934
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Like I just seem to remember hearing that something with

935
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Sega and it kind of never came to fruition

936
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
But we've been like waiting a long time

937
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
And thought there would be a big announcement

938
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Like I thought there would be something at E3

939
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Or even Tokyo Game Show about this

940
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
But no this just was like no yeah we're gonna

941
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Just put these up in the marketplace enjoy

942
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Well that's why you're seeing a lot of these older games that are

943
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Very niche and stuff because these companies aren't gonna

944
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Necessarily put out like these HD

945
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Remakes or whatever of their old games

946
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
So like obviously you're not gonna

947
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Find a Grand Theft Auto or something like that

948
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Is part of this because

949
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
You know as we discussed last week of course

950
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
They're going to at some point up res all the

951
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Grand Theft Auto games and put it out on a disc

952
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
I mean it's just

953
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Stupid that if they don't I mean

954
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Why wouldn't you especially if you know San Andreas

955
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
It would be easy all you would have to do

956
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Is re-license the music in there

957
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Obviously that would be a cost

958
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
And maybe re-record you wouldn't even

959
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Necessarily have to re-record the

960
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Audio in the game

961
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Obviously you'd have to get the rights from all the

962
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Voice actors and stuff like that but

963
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
You know if you put it in the

964
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Rage Engine or something like that and they've already

965
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Done that on the PC modders have already taken care of that

966
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
It could be done

967
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
And it's just getting all the

968
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Rights and all the legal stuff taken

969
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Care of but once they do that I mean

970
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
It's just gonna be amazing

971
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Going to our chatroom for some comments at chat.orangelauncherady.com

972
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
SSJ100Matt

973
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Says it's tactics like this that make

974
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
People want to hack their PlayStation 3

975
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
YYR says maybe

976
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
They're just doing software emulation

977
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Wasn't there a PlayStation 3 model that did that already

978
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Although it didn't support every game?

979
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
I remember that too wasn't it the Europe one?

980
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Or maybe they had one here too but wasn't there

981
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
One overseas?

982
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
The old 80 gig systems that came

983
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Out here a long time ago

984
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
80 and the 40

985
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
I think it was the 80 gig systems like the

986
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Melger Solid one it was one of the first ones that

987
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Supported just some of

988
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
The titles and not all of them

989
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
You mean like the one sitting in my front room?

990
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Maybe. And then the 40 gig

991
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Systems stopped supporting it and eventually

992
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
The 80 gig systems also stopped supporting it

993
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
But yeah it is

994
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Software emulation so

995
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Is the PlayStation 1 games

996
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
And in fact the PlayStation 1

997
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Games you can take that

998
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Emulator and basically dump any ISO

999
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Into it and it'll work just fine

1000
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
That's what they've done on hacked PSPs

1001
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Is they've taken that same emulator and you

1002
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Can run any PlayStation 1 game

1003
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
And I'm guessing this is probably the same

1004
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Situation with the PlayStation 2 stuff

1005
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Is it's just an emulator that they have

1006
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
And they've found a way to just

1007
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Basically they can dump any ISO in there

1008
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
And done. They're ready to go

1009
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
I don't know cause I haven't really seen anybody

1010
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Try to hack it apart yet but

1011
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
I'm guessing that's probably what it is

1012
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Do you think they'll make a lot of money off this Loki?

1013
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Um yeah cause especially the games

1014
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
That they're putting up like Odin Sphere you know

1015
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
That's a game that was out there for just a

1016
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Little bit and it's a pretty awesome game

1017
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
And a lot of people probably missed it and same with

1018
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
God Hand. God Hand was another one that was just

1019
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
You know clover game that's just

1020
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Amazing

1021
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Yeah I gotta admit there's some of those that I kinda

1022
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Want to check out too but thankfully

1023
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Alan has like a couple of these

1024
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Already so it's just like oh we just

1025
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Gotta hook up the PlayStation 2

1026
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
It's sad though that they aren't even

1027
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Trying to like

1028
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Update these at all I mean they're not even

1029
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Smoothing out the graphics

1030
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Or whatever that you would get I think you can

1031
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Do that with the PlayStation 3

1032
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Well shit I haven't even tried to run

1033
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
A PlayStation 2 game on my 20

1034
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Gig well 500 gig now

1035
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
But um

1036
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
I know you can do the smoothing stuff

1037
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Like kind of how you were able to with the

1038
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
PlayStation 2 on PlayStation 1 games

1039
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
You know it was a little bit better

1040
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Um

1041
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
But yeah I mean it's just

1042
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
It's kinda sad

1043
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
That they're selling them and now I understand

1044
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Yeah I need to make money but

1045
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
I think it would make a lot of people happy

1046
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
If they you know brought that out there

1047
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
So people can do that and then you can

1048
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Sell the games as well cause not everybody has

1049
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Got hand or Odin Sphere

1050
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
And hell you can't

1051
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Buy new copies of that anymore so

1052
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
That might be a good way to

1053
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
You know drive sales and same with the PlayStation 1 games

1054
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
PS3's are fully

1055
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Backwards compatible with PlayStation 1 games

1056
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
And I'm pretty sure they sell a lot of PlayStation 1

1057
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Games on their network so

1058
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
I don't understand why they don't do it

1059
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Um if I may rewind just a little bit

1060
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Sure of course

1061
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
The game's plot that was a

1062
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Pre-order one

1063
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Um are including it when it's available

1064
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Oh okay

1065
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Nice

1066
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Woohoo

1067
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Good to know

1068
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Alright well let's move on with some other news

1069
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
This is also about Sony and a comment

1070
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
That they have made this week and it's about

1071
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
The Vita which a lot of people are looking forward to

1072
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
And I gotta say I'm one of them

1073
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
I'm definitely picking up a Vita at launch

1074
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Loki you're getting one of these too right?

1075
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Maybe

1076
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
What are you sitting on the fence with right now

1077
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
That has more financial

1078
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Stuff it's financial

1079
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Is it? Okay

1080
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Well it is a financial investment I guess no matter how you look at it

1081
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
I mean I guess it's financial for me too

1082
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
But I just I have a real tendency to spend a lot of money

1083
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
On stupid crap

1084
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
The lineup is looking nice it's just

1085
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
We'll see what they have at launch I mean

1086
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Alright well let's talk about a comment

1087
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
That Jon Culler this week who's the director

1088
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Of hardware marketing mentioned in an interview with

1089
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Investor Palace

1090
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Quote we firmly believe that PlayStation Vita

1091
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Will supersede the mobile market when launched

1092
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
And have grand ambitions for a product

1093
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
That is really at the forefront of innovation

1094
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
The mobile market in the US

1095
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Offers consumers extremely light gaming

1096
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Options

1097
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
So in other words

1098
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
They seem to think that

1099
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Despite the fact that the iPhone

1100
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Is out there with their mobile gaming and all that

1101
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
That the Vita

1102
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Can kind of give mobile gaming

1103
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
A run for its money

1104
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Even though it's not a phone

1105
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Yeah

1106
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Um

1107
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
I don't know about that

1108
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
I do like the fact that

1109
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
They're opening up to developers

1110
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
And the fact that it has controllers

1111
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
I mean buttons

1112
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
It's important and it's definitely

1113
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Something that's sorely missed on a lot of these

1114
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
You know iPhone games and stuff and

1115
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
The fact that it's gonna have

1116
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Still the touch sensor you could

1117
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Pretty much if you're a developer you could port this

1118
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Stuff over to the PlayStation

1119
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Or whatever

1120
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
And you know if it does

1121
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
End up turning out to be pretty viable

1122
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
You could see a lot of stuff coming out of there

1123
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
And yeah they could quickly catch up

1124
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Beating out Apple right away

1125
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
I don't know about that

1126
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
I mean cause they're not gonna sell more units

1127
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Than there are iPhones or iPods or whatever

1128
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
iPads

1129
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Just like their two tablets I mean come on

1130
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Yeah those things are terrible looking

1131
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
I mean come on

1132
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
No

1133
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
I

1134
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Well you know I'm still looking forward to the Vita

1135
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
And I think the intricacy of the games

1136
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
On here are not gonna be able to

1137
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
I mean I will be

1138
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
A step higher certainly than what you get

1139
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
On the iPhone and so forth despite everything

1140
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
That you know iPhone showed this week

1141
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
But

1142
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
I think the other big thing that sets this apart

1143
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Is just the fact that it's designed as a gaming system

1144
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
First so therefore you have things like

1145
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
I don't know tangible buttons

1146
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
And sort of the features that gamers

1147
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Would want but of course

1148
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
This whole comment like this you know

1149
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
We're better than

1150
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
The mobile games and so forth I think it just serves

1151
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
As justification for them to charge way more money

1152
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
For the games and how much weren't you saying the games

1153
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Were like 50 bucks on this thing right now

1154
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Yeah that's what the PSP games are

1155
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
I just I couldn't I always thought

1156
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
PSP games are

1157
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
$40 now

1158
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
But they're they used to be 50 bucks

1159
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
I mean it's just now

1160
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
You're not seeing a lot of games sold on there

1161
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
But yeah there's still $50 games on the PSP

1162
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
And I think that's a great price point

1163
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
I mean assuming that stays there

1164
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
And doesn't go any higher cause

1165
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
I don't know I just

1166
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Don't think they should be but I like the fact though

1167
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
That the system is gonna be very much like the original

1168
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
PSP where it's a gaming system

1169
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
But it does a lot of other shit

1170
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Right right and I think

1171
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
That will be probably ultimately its greatest

1172
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Strength as well is that it's a great college

1173
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Kids system and I think that's

1174
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Probably where the PSP sold a lot too

1175
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
So there you go

1176
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Alright well DarkSakura what do you got for us?

1177
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
I have some stuff and it's more

1178
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Sony yay

1179
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Basically they've implied that

1180
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
All the first party titles are going to use the online pass

1181
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Basically they're

1182
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Pulling an EA like the $10

1183
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Deal so they're

1184
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Saying that Uncharted 3 is gonna use

1185
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
The online pass system

1186
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
That was introduced earlier with Resistance 3

1187
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
And saying that

1188
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Online pass will be incorporated into future Sony

1189
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Computer Entertainment Worldwide Studios

1190
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Games with online functionality

1191
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Let me say they're gonna

1192
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Announce more on it later

1193
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Well now a first party is on board I think it's time to

1194
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Just accept that this is now the norm

1195
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Yeah right? Pretty much

1196
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
There's still some people that are

1197
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
I think you'll see a lot more third parties do it

1198
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
You're not gonna see Microsoft do it

1199
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
They can't I mean that would just look good

1200
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Microsoft can't do it you're right I agree with you there

1201
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Unless they stop charging for gold

1202
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Which they're not gonna do

1203
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
So it would be very interesting

1204
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
If they try though

1205
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
I can't wait for that episode

1206
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
And Nintendo well you know

1207
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
They don't even know online exists

1208
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
What online? Exactly

1209
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
That was funny you made a story

1210
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
It's like you have to charge for an online pass

1211
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
What? There's online? There's online?

1212
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
So we can maintain our online system

1213
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
What?

1214
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
What online?

1215
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Well who knows?

1216
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
There's still a lot of question marks

1217
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Like what does it do?

1218
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Well one of those huge question marks is

1219
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
How's it gonna handle online?

1220
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
And they have been purposefully quiet on it

1221
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Because they don't fucking know

1222
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
They better know by June

1223
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Like crap

1224
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
We have to do online as well

1225
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Our online system will be significant

1226
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Significantly bad

1227
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
I told you at E3 right

1228
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
When they brought the EA guy out on stage

1229
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
I thought he was gonna come out to announce

1230
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
The EA guy

1231
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
That EA was gonna just do the online part of the Wii

1232
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Like I seriously thought

1233
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Cause they were talking about a partnership and stuff

1234
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
And they mentioned like online games and stuff

1235
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
And I thought oh they're just gonna let EA

1236
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Handle the online part of the Wii

1237
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
That'll be what it is

1238
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
No that wasn't what it is

1239
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
That would be terrible if they did that

1240
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
And that would be sad

1241
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Alright moving on Loki

1242
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
So

1243
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
It's kinda cool during the same time as

1244
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
The Apple

1245
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
And Vail of their new

1246
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Technology devices and stuff like that

1247
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
There was this whole

1248
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Kind of like Flash

1249
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Adobe conference

1250
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Adobe Max conference going on

1251
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
And some of the new things

1252
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
That they're showing first off

1253
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Unreal Engine support for Flash 11

1254
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Which is kind of interesting

1255
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
You're gonna actually have some really decent looking games now

1256
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Running in the Flash

1257
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Or even in your own

1258
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Web browser so

1259
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
That's kinda cool

1260
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
People are saying hey maybe

1261
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
This could be a major transition in social gaming

1262
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
No it won't

1263
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
I'm afraid that's not gonna be the case

1264
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Cause you know what

1265
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Yes the technology may be out there

1266
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
To do that

1267
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
But doesn't necessarily mean that a company

1268
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Is going to do that seeing as they can develop a game

1269
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Much cheaper that doesn't necessarily

1270
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Need the Unreal 3 engine

1271
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
But it's neat to see that

1272
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Hey someday we may be playing

1273
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Unreal Tournament

1274
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
In our web browser

1275
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
And then

1276
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Of course not to be outdone by that

1277
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Crytek also is

1278
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Investigating Flash for the

1279
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Cry engine and possibly

1280
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Doing some sort of cross platform

1281
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Solution including

1282
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Support with

1283
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
A bunch of other

1284
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Systems. They're even saying maybe

1285
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Looking into iOS and Android that'd be kinda cool

1286
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
I don't know if that'd be able to

1287
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Obviously not some of the phones

1288
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Out there like mine but

1289
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Very cool

1290
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
And of course they're saying

1291
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Crytek Seal is hard

1292
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
To work at. The first person shooter

1293
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Warface which is supposed to be coming out in

1294
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Asian regions

1295
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
But

1296
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
It might be pretty cool if they do some

1297
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Sort of easy

1298
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Cross platform solution you may see a lot of these

1299
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
PC games being ported to

1300
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
Many other devices other than just

1301
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Xbox 360 and PS3

1302
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
In the near future

1303
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
So

1304
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
That's cool and it'll be interesting to see

1305
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
If web browsers actually get

1306
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Enough technology where

1307
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
They can support really good looking

1308
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Games that would be kind of interesting

1309
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Because then you wouldn't necessarily need

1310
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
You know like

1311
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
A tablet device or game

1312
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Console or whatever you just

1313
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Play the game. Well web based

1314
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Game also makes me think about

1315
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Facebook games and Google Plus

1316
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Games of which I wish more stuff was

1317
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
There on Google Plus but whatever

1318
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
You know and whether you love or hate

1319
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Facebook games you gotta think

1320
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
If this technology is gonna be available

1321
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Soon like could you imagine if

1322
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Unreal was a Facebook game?

1323
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
I don't know if that would be

1324
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
I see the problem is

1325
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
I just shot my friend DarkSakura

1326
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
In the face! Click here

1327
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
To post to your wall and try Unreal

1328
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Games now. The problem with that though is

1329
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
I just don't see them

1330
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Doing like a casual game

1331
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Like that because once again you know Facebook

1332
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Kind of tends to

1333
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Skew towards casual gamers

1334
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
And I don't really see

1335
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Unreal Tournament you know

1336
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Appealing to my mom or something

1337
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Unreal Engine shows up in really weird

1338
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Stuff. Yes that's true. Like you wouldn't expect

1339
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
A game I completely neglected to mention

1340
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
In my game week probably because I

1341
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Played it like three weeks ago

1342
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
When I was on hiatus from the show

1343
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Was the Mortal Kombat collection

1344
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
The classic Mortal Kombats

1345
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
I downloaded that on Playstation Network

1346
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
And played that a little bit

1347
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
And I was surprised to see the powered by

1348
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Unreal technology logo at the beginning

1349
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
I realized the new game is

1350
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
But I was like well what the hell about the classic

1351
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Emulation needs the fucking Unreal

1352
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Engine? Like really?

1353
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
The only thing I could possibly think of

1354
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Are the little like rotating

1355
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Images of the arcade cabinets

1356
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
I'm like what?

1357
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Or maybe there's some maybe I just

1358
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Haven't seen it yet maybe there's like an unlockable demo

1359
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
For the new one or something that shows up

1360
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
But I was kind of surprised to see that

1361
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
I was like okay I know

1362
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Mortal Kombat 3 and 2 and 1

1363
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Did not run on the Unreal Engine

1364
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
No I'm pretty sure they did not

1365
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
This is funny to me

1366
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
So

1367
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Although if they somehow you know

1368
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Enabled it to where they took the old

1369
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
MoCap stuff and made it into actual

1370
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
3D models with the

1371
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
MoCap license

1372
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
You know likenesses and stuff

1373
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
It would be very interesting to see something like that

1374
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
It's like oh hey look it's classic Mortal Kombat

1375
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
But we can turn it in any direction

1376
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
And it's 3D

1377
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Some might pay for that

1378
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Tigerclaw in our chatroom at chat.orangetontrader.com says

1379
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
An Unreal web based game is possible

1380
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Look at Quake Live for example

1381
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Well there's a good example Quake Live is a good time

1382
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
So

1383
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
I'd like to see more stuff like that

1384
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Certainly it would be very interesting

1385
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
It would also be interesting to see what MMOs

1386
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
That's another big thing that web browsers are used for

1387
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Some of those free MMOs

1388
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Although the quality of some of those is

1389
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Questionable

1390
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
This could take a lot of that to the next level

1391
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
It would be interesting to see what happens

1392
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Dear Square Enix

1393
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Final Fantasy XIV

1394
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Do Square Enix already uses Unreal Engine

1395
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
For some of their projects?

1396
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Well I know they used it for one game that no one ever bought

1397
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
It was Infinite Undiscovery right?

1398
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Haven't they used it on Unreal Engine?

1399
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Infinite Undiscovery was the other one that came out around the same time

1400
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Yes that no one bought

1401
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
I can't remember the name of it

1402
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Last Remnant

1403
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
No one bought it

1404
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
No I remember that because I think Alan bought it

1405
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Or he had it

1406
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Or played it or something

1407
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
I thought there was another

1408
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Final Fantasy XIII uses Unreal

1409
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Oh really?

1410
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
I think it does

1411
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Hmm

1412
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
You know what I miss?

1413
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
That was pretty cool

1414
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
What? What are you talking about?

1415
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Do you remember the Square Enix game The Bouncer?

1416
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
I remember that game

1417
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
I remember a brawler called Ergeist

1418
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
But I don't remember

1419
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Oh Ergeist was awesome

1420
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
That's a game you need a sequel for right there

1421
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
The Bouncer was an early PS2 title

1422
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Yeah it was actually pretty awesome

1423
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Were they all Final Fantasy X characters?

1424
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Except they worked in a bar?

1425
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
As bouncers

1426
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
As bouncers

1427
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
It was a weird game

1428
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
It was awesome

1429
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Alright

1430
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
I tried to look at the Wikipedia article for Final Fantasy XIII

1431
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
When I need to do research quickly

1432
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
There's always Wikipedia

1433
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Where people have done the research for me

1434
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
I tried to do a search on Unreal and didn't find it

1435
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
But I thought I saw that logo in the beginning of the game

1436
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Or heard something about it

1437
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Speaking of Final Fantasy

1438
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
It's not on our show roll tonight

1439
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Since I brought up XIII it just triggered it for me

1440
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Did you guys see the full trailer for XIII Versus?

1441
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
At the web this week?

1442
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
It looks hot

1443
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
It looks very hot

1444
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
It's Final Fantasy, but I have no idea why it's XIII

1445
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
I know it's set in the same universe

1446
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
But I didn't see any of the characters

1447
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Not really, I thought it was supposed to set more of a real

1448
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
I don't know what the hell it has to do with XIII

1449
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
But whatever

1450
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
There will probably be some obscure little thing when you actually play the game

1451
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
But the action, the battles

1452
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Kind of look like Kingdom Hearts

1453
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
With the hit points showing up on the screen

1454
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
It looks sweet actually

1455
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
We're going to do an awesome radio moment here

1456
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
And I'm going to pull up the trailer here in studio

1457
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
And I'll post this in chat so you guys can see this too

1458
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
For those of you that are on the podcast feed

1459
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
I'll have DarkSakura posted to our Tumblr

1460
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
At orangeloungeradio.tumblr.com

1461
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Are you not an IRC DarkSakura?

1462
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
I am an IRC

1463
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
I meant like privately so I can copy the URL

1464
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Oh yeah I will

1465
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
As soon as I pull it up here

1466
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
I remember, is this it? No this isn't the right one

1467
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Where did I see that trailer?

1468
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Somebody in chat will probably

1469
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Hello Tigerclaw

1470
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Right?

1471
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Tigerclaw should have posted it by now

1472
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Gameplay trailer

1473
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Maybe it's

1474
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
No that's Eidos, that's Deus Ex

1475
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Who the hell posted this

1476
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
And I watched it the other day

1477
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
I think somebody had posted it on Facebook

1478
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Oh so in other news

1479
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
No kidding

1480
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
I have made Fantastic Nut Bread

1481
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
It was quite delicious

1482
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
It has no flour

1483
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
I made it with no flour

1484
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
It's made with almond meal

1485
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
You're not trying to find anything on the new Facebook by the way

1486
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Your mission

1487
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
If you choose to accept it

1488
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Find something on Facebook

1489
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
There's a plugin for Chrome that makes it run like the old version

1490
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Yes

1491
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
The problem is I don't want to use Chrome

1492
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
But yeah

1493
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Oh yeah that's right

1494
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
They did have the last remnant on PC

1495
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Anyway

1496
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Well Rob's looking that up

1497
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
I found one

1498
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
But it's not the right one

1499
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
They did a flip of it

1500
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
I'm trying to see if I can find the

1501
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Holy crap

1502
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
I'm trying to see if I can find the actual gameplay parts

1503
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Oh wait

1504
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
This was uploaded in like 2009

1505
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
This isn't even right

1506
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Gosh darn it

1507
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Tigerclaw find it for us

1508
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
I will keep looking for it

1509
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Sorry guys

1510
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Terrible radio

1511
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
But I know I saw it

1512
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
Shoot the next story is mine

1513
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
I can't look for it while I talk about this story

1514
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
So I'll get through this quickly

1515
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Although maybe not because this is actually pretty big news

1516
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
Microsoft has talked a little bit this week

1517
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
About some of the TV updates

1518
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
For the Xbox 360

1519
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
We knew after E3 that they were going to be doing this

1520
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
They were going to be bringing more television to the 360

1521
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
But we didn't really know how

1522
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Well it turns out

1523
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
They've announced some partnerships

1524
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
And some of those include HBO

1525
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
And HBO Go, Comcast, Syfy

1526
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
And Verizon

1527
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
I guess there was an earlier list that had leaked

1528
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
And it turns out a lot of that seems to be correct

1529
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
They did publish a full list of the

1530
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
Partners that will be in the fall dashboard update

1531
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Comcast went so far

1532
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
As to make a blog post talking about

1533
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Using the partnership with Microsoft to

1534
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Offer Xfinity content

1535
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
So it sounds like, and this is

1536
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Of direct relevance to me because

1537
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
I have Comcast at home living where I live

1538
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
It sounds like

1539
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
That you will be able to

1540
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Use the on demand system

1541
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
In Comcast, you can use that

1542
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
In

1543
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
The 360 now

1544
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
But see that's the thing

1545
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
I was hoping it would be more original stuff

1546
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
And not necessarily just everything that's on

1547
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Demand, because if I want to watch on demand

1548
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
I can hit one

1549
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Button on my remote and I get on demand

1550
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Content, I don't need to necessarily

1551
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
You know, unless

1552
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Unless you're able to like say

1553
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Take your console to

1554
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Friends house or something like that and then you can

1555
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Access all your on demand content

1556
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
That way

1557
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
I don't know, I was just hoping for more

1558
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Original stuff, like an alternative

1559
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
That me having to have cable

1560
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
You know what I mean?

1561
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Bajillion alternatives out there anyway

1562
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
So I mean

1563
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
This is just adding to the pile

1564
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
So

1565
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
What I'm also curious of is that if

1566
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
They're announcing all these other partnerships

1567
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
The weird thing is though, doesn't HBO want to

1568
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Charge you 10 bucks for their service and then

1569
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
These other, well HBO I don't think you can

1570
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Access unless you have HBO, it's kind of like

1571
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
How Xfinity

1572
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
And stuff, you can't access HBO

1573
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
On demand stuff unless you have HBO

1574
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
And isn't it the same with like

1575
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
A mobile app, like you can't access

1576
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Mobile CNN video unless you have like

1577
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Comcast or something? Yeah, see so

1578
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
That's why I was just kind of like

1579
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Eh, don't really care, I mean cause

1580
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Well, I gotta say though, I do like

1581
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
The idea that you know, because the HBO

1582
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Stuff isn't on Netflix and it's not really on

1583
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Demand either, I like that it'll kind of be

1584
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
All in one place, like I get what you're

1585
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Saying with the one button on the remote, but

1586
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
You know, if the Xbox 360 is gonna be this

1587
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
All in one entertainment device, it'd be nice

1588
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
If you can DVR stuff, that'd be pretty awesome

1589
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
If you don't want to pay for DVR

1590
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
I don't think that's gonna

1591
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Happen, but you know

1592
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Also, it looks like

1593
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
AT&T U-verse is gonna

1594
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Require Xbox Live Gold

1595
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Starting in November, that was a note

1596
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
That was sent by the AT&T folks

1597
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
To their customers, which I'm assuming

1598
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Is lining it up with everything else here, right?

1599
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
The TV service will actually require Xbox Live Gold

1600
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
All of them

1601
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
But before

1602
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Their boxes or whatever

1603
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Through AT&T U-verse, because some of them

1604
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Still already have that

1605
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
You know, they do not require

1606
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Gold

1607
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
But they will now come November

1608
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
That might make some people a little bit upset

1609
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
But not AT&T customers, though

1610
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Nope

1611
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Because they're giving them a $60 credit

1612
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Right, so yes, they give

1613
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
A $60 credit

1614
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
To existing AT&T U-verse customers

1615
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
For Xbox 360 customers

1616
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Now is that each year or just one year?

1617
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
I think it's just one time, probably

1618
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
That would make sense

1619
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
I want Comcast to give me a $60 credit

1620
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
Alright, so

1621
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
Who found this? Loki found this

1622
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Did you find this with somebody's help in chat?

1623
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
Nope, I searched Final Fantasy 13

1624
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
Versus sort by date

1625
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Alright, well good job

1626
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Here's what the gameplay looks like in the game

1627
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
So you can kind of see

1628
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
There's some live action

1629
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Things that happen

1630
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
The final round still kind of looks

1631
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
13-ish, but there's a lot of life

1632
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
So here's some battle

1633
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
What's he doing in New York?

1634
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Right, it's kind of Kingdom Hearts-ish

1635
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
But with that very

1636
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Final Fantasy 7

1637
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Or 7 slash 13

1638
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Environment, you know what I mean

1639
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
The swirly bits look like 12

1640
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Yeah, I can see that

1641
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
I can see a little bit of 12 here, too

1642
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
But I like this, too

1643
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Did you notice those little pictures in the corner

1644
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
That the people are actually

1645
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Live rendering what the people are doing

1646
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
That's pretty cool

1647
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Here, watch your safety

1648
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
It's cool, yeah, it's awesome

1649
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
It's not just a static picture, it's what they're doing

1650
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
That's like that add-on I use in WoW

1651
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
It's like X-Pearl

1652
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Yeah, it's X-Pearl

1653
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Final Fantasy X-Pearl

1654
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
So there you go, there's what your Final Fantasy looks like

1655
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Is that Cloud?

1656
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
It's Cloud with a gun

1657
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Send me that and I'll put it on our

1658
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Tumble bubble blubber

1659
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
There it is for the chatters

1660
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Because I know us watching trailers isn't always the best radio

1661
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
But there you go, now you have a place you can go look it up

1662
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
If you haven't already seen it

1663
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
So, I guess let's move on

1664
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
With some other gaming news

1665
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Dark Sakura

1666
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Complete with an ad by Queen Latifah

1667
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Sorry, Dark Sakura, I've got to distract you from the trailer

1668
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Well, how about some Skyward Sword characters

1669
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
There's actually

1670
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
A few spoilers

1671
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
And you'll hear it here first

1672
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
So there is

1673
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
Link and Zelda

1674
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Are childhood friends

1675
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
And have a special bond

1676
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
There is a bully

1677
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
At Link's school named Groose

1678
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
G-R-O-O-S-E

1679
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
And there is

1680
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
A person named Fe

1681
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Who is the spirit

1682
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Don't worry, Link, it gets better

1683
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Spirit of the Goddess Sword

1684
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
And there is

1685
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
Gaepora

1686
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
Who is

1687
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Zelda's father

1688
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
And the headmaster of Link's school

1689
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
So

1690
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
There is another place in the game called

1691
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Faron Woods

1692
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
And you start off the game in a place called

1693
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Skyloft

1694
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
And you can go to Skyview Temple

1695
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Where Zelda was kidnapped and is being held

1696
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Again, yay

1697
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
As far as attacks

1698
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
That are in there, there's holding down the A button

1699
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Makes Link run faster and gives him acrobatic

1700
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Abilities, he can run up

1701
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
Walls

1702
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
I guess like he's Spider-Man or some shit

1703
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Or the fucking

1704
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
Prince of Persia

1705
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
He can grab onto cliffs

1706
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
But that uses Link's stamina

1707
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
But you can replenish his stamina over time

1708
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
There's a spin attack that gives you stamina

1709
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
And when your stamina is depleted

1710
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
You go slowly

1711
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
You become old man Link

1712
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
And that's all I'm going to talk about it

1713
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Although

1714
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
There is one interesting thing that's in there

1715
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
You can douse

1716
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
You know what dousing is right?

1717
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
You know the old thing where people would have

1718
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
The forked stick and look for water

1719
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
That's dousing

1720
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
I thought there was another name for that

1721
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
A diving rod?

1722
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
Divining rod

1723
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
Because I've known

1724
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Hippy people that do like

1725
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
Dowsing on your aura and stuff

1726
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
I know hippies

1727
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Rama in our chat room says

1728
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Link in high school, what is this? Saved by the Triforce?

1729
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
But anyway

1730
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Tiffany Amber Thiessen will be playing

1731
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
The part of Zelda

1732
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
But for dousing basically you hold out

1733
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
The sword and point it in the direction of the target

1734
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
And it will flash

1735
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
So basically it's to lead you in the right direction

1736
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
It's kind of

1737
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Hmm

1738
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
Shadow Colossus did it first

1739
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
So

1740
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
Bunny did it back in the

1741
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
40's

1742
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
Simpsons did it

1743
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
I'm done

1744
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Well just for

1745
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
Rama

1746
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
Since Rama brought it up

1747
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
I was going to play this for you

1748
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
This was Dark Sakura's reaction

1749
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
To actually hearing about the Zelda game

1750
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Yes I can

1751
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
I'm so excited

1752
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
I'm so excited

1753
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
I'm so

1754
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Scared

1755
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
You know I never watched that show for a reason

1756
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
That was the infamous

1757
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
Caffeine Pills episode

1758
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
I understand

1759
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
But I never

1760
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Watched that show because I can't watch a show with people

1761
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Acting stupid

1762
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
Seriously that's why I don't watch Seinfeld

1763
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
But yet you went with us to watch Showgirls

1764
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
Because that's different

1765
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
They weren't being stupid to be funny

1766
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
It was funny without trying to be funny

1767
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Let's travel around the world

1768
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
And check out what's going to be coming to a game store

1769
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Near you

1770
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
Saved by the bell collection on blu-ray maybe?

1771
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
I don't know

1772
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
That's not a game

1773
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Thank god

1774
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
That'd be terrible

1775
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Anything saved by the bell in the game would be terrible

1776
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
Unless you had to murder all of them

1777
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
In which case that could be cool

1778
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
So this week actually some pretty cool stuff

1779
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000

1780
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
And Xbox 360

1781
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000

01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000

1793
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
That is kind of

1794
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
A superhero

1795
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
Kinect game that's coming out

1796
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
Red Dead Redemption Game of the Year edition

1797
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Definitely a good buy if you haven't

1798
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
Picked it up yet

1799
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000

01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
And the Wii and you can expect

1815
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
Kinect support there

1816
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
Mahjong Cubed for the 3DS

1817
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
Cause that's what we need is Mahjong games on there

1818
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
Hulk Hogan's

1819
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000

And the

1822
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
Hidden on the 3DS

1823
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Kind of an augmented reality

1824
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Ghost hunting game

1825
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
Marvel Superhero Squad the Infinity Gauntlet

1826
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
On the 3DS this week

1827
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
Kind of a port of the old one

1828
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
As we've been talking a little bit about

1829
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
This game

1830
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
Talking some of the tracks coming out

1831
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Very surprisingly there's actually some really good

1832
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
Tracks in here. Dance Dance Revolution 2

1833
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000

1834
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000

Bundles $50

1838
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
Worth checking out if you're interested in some of the new

1839

Arcade songs cause they're in the game

1840

01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
That's coming out on Xbox 360

01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000

From Namco

1847
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
There's a lot of fucking games this week

1848
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Lots of games

1849
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
Jonah Luma Rugby Challenge on 360

1850
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
Yet another rugby game exclusive to

1851
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
GameStop for some reason

1852
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
And uh

1853
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
1001 Touch Games on

1854
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
Nintendo DS, Might and Magic Heroes

1855
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
Why on earth would you make your game exclusive to GameStop?

1856
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
Rugby games

1857
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
They did that, yeah

1858
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
It's weird. The last rugby game that came out

1859
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
People like rugby? I understand that but

1860
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
People don't like GameStop and I don't want to go

1861
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
There to get my rugby game

1862
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
I mean, let's be real. I'm not gonna buy it

1863
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
505 did it with their last rugby game that came out

1864
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
At the beginning of September and they made it

1865
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
Yeah, nobody has explained to me

1866
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
What the fucking connection between GameStop and

1867
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Rugby is

1868
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
I have no clue. No idea

1869
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
1001 Touch Games

1870
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
For the DS, Might and Magic Heroes

1871
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
6 on PC

1872
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
And god a game

1873
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
I hope tanks so god damn bad

1874
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
Skylanders Spyro's Adventure

1875
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
On Playstation 3, Xbox 360

1876
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
Wii, 3DS and PC

1877
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
May it burn in hell

1878
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
And for the new listeners

1879
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
Why do you want this game to fail?

1880
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
It's because it's a pain in the ass

1881
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
It's Activision's adventure into

1882
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
Toys and games

1883
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
And if you think download content is bad

1884
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
And you think oh Activision they're gonna

1885
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
Whore out download content

1886
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
You ain't seeing shit with

1887
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
Skylanders

1888
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
My god, they have 30 different

1889
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
Toys you can buy

1890
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Little figurines, and I hardly even call them toys

1891
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
They do not move whatsoever

1892
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
They're statues, they're basically

1893
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
Download content, they cost $8 each

1894
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Cause they're trying to get kids

1895
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
To buy the shit

1896
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
And you know how twisted this is?

1897
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
They got in bed with Toys R Us

1898
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
So that they can get on their top

1899
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
Hot 15 games

1900
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
Or Hot 15 toys list

1901
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
Which they did, and they have an exclusive pack

1902
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Over at Toys R Us, a 3 pack of their figures

1903
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
Yeah, cause that hot

1904
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
Hot games list, yeah that's not manipulated

1905
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
At all to get people to buy shit

1906
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
Right

1907
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
So, hope it tanks

1908
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
So don't follow the hot games list

1909
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
Yes, don't follow it, and it's not

1910
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
It's rigged, it's not Spyro

1911
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
Spyro, it's not what it used to be

1912
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
Shenanigans, it's just like us getting nominated

1913
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
For a podcast award, shenanigans

1914
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
It's just, it's really not worth it

1915
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
I mean seriously, it's $70

1916
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
To buy this game, on a 3DS

1917
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
By the way, it's $70 for the 3DS

1918
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
Wow, oh my god

1919
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
And $70 on every other platform except PC

1920
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
Which is $60

1921
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
Do you really want to spend $70 for a happy square game?

1922
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
Will the little toys do my laundry?

1923
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Nope, they do nothing, they do not move at all

1924
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
Alright, I'm just saying

1925
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
This will be the next

1926
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
Tony Hawk ride game

1927
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
I mean, it's

1928
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
I will be surprised if this takes off

1929
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Alright, we'll see what happens

1930
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
If that's it for your releases, then let's go to Japan

1931
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
And check out what's coming out in Japan

1932
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
On the Xbox 360 this week in Japan

1933
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
Dead Rising 2 off the record

1934
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Forza Motorsport 4 gets its release in Japan

1935
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
As well as Ace Combat, Assault Horizon

1936
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
Call of Juarez, the Cartel

1937
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
Halo Reach gets a price reduction

1938
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
In the Platinum Collection in Japan this week

1939
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
And Connectimals gets a release

1940
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
Is this the one that has bears in it?

1941
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
Plus bears, yeah

1942
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
It's Connectimals

1943
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
Yes, that's right

1944
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
Connectimals and bears

1945
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
By the way, when I was at Disneyland

1946
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
I went in the Innovations building

1947
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
They have a lot of Kinect stuff there

1948
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
In the Innovations building

1949
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
You can play like Child of Eden and stuff

1950
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
But they have a little room, and I thought this was neat

1951
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
They had a little room set up for kids

1952
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
And they were actually people working for Disney

1953
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
Helping these kids play Connectimals

1954
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
And they had it on a giant TV

1955
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
I'm talking like the size of the wall in this house

1956
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
They had a giant TV playing Connectimals

1957
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
My friend Victoria played it for a little bit

1958
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
It was kind of fun

1959
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
It's nice to see some love in the Innovations building

1960
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
I thought it was closed

1961
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
I think it kind of closes

1962
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
It's been remodeled since the last time

1963
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
I was there, and you don't

1964
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
Enter the same way you used to

1965
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
There's no little show when you go in

1966
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
They figured that was kind of dry

1967
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
Well, we made it a point

1968
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
We said we each need to do something we've never

1969
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
Done at Disneyland before, and my friend Victoria

1970
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
Had never been to the Innovations building

1971
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
So we went in

1972
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
And believe it or not, there's some neat stuff in there

1973
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
They still have some Microsoft Surfaces

1974
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
Remember those? The tables?

1975
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
Those were fun

1976
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
So what did you not do before Disneyland?

1977
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
What did I not do before that we did?

1978
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
I don't remember

1979
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
Did you go on the boat?

1980
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
I think there was a ride we went on

1981
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
That I just hadn't been on before

1982
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
For whatever reason

1983
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
I can't remember off the top of my head

1984
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
Did you sneak onto the PeopleMover?

1985
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
We went to the Carnation Plaza grounds

1986
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
And we ate lunch there

1987
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
I don't think that was the official thing

1988
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
But we did eat our lunch there

1989
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
Because that's going away because they're making the new

1990
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
Tangled area there

1991
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
And the Fantasyland expansion

1992
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
We just sat and ate and enjoyed it

1993
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
For the last time

1994
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
I liked where we ate last time

1995
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
In New Orleans Square

1996
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
That was great

1997
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
Carnation Plaza Gardens

1998
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
It's been there since the 50s

1999
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
And it's where they used to do some live shows

2000
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
And events but now it's like

2001
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
Hardly anybody's there and it's right smack in the middle

2002
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
That's another little restaurant that's at the end of Main Street isn't it?

2003
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
There's no restaurant there anymore

2004
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
I mean but it was a restaurant at the end of Main Street

2005
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
That's across from where the buffet is

2006
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
On the opposite side

2007
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
Yes it is

2008
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
So you can name something in Disneyland and I can pretty much figure out where it is

2009
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
Alright

2010
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
Moving on to

2011
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
I want to make sure

2012
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
I caught everything on the 360

2013
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
Let me go on to the

2014
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
PlayStation 3

2015
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
Which this week will get

2016
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
Ace Combat, Assault Horizon, Dead Rising 2

2017
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
Off the record

2018
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
As well as Call of Juarez, the Cartel

2019
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
And Medal of Honor gets a price reduction going into the Best Hits series

2020
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
And that is again PlayStation 3

2021
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
In Japan

2022
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
Trying to quickly look and see if there's anything

2023
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
On 3DS this week

2024
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
Or

2025
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
The Wii even

2026
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
Let's see the 3DS

2027
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
Nope not this week

2028
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
There's a game called Izito 3D

2029
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
That's it

2030
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
But the Misty Pink 3DS has come out next week

2031
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
And I know Loki already has his preordered

2032
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
On the Wii though Just Dance Wii

2033
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
Gets a Japanese release this week

2034
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
I guess that's notable

2035
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
Especially for music game fans

2036
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
I don't know if the song list has been localized or what have you

2037
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
You know I was going to mention something real quick

2038
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
Cause I noticed this last night when I was checking

2039
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
Dead Rising 2 had any download content

2040
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
Just Dance 3

2041
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
What they have is they have it where you can download trials

2042
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
So you can check out the songs before you buy them

2043
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
I think that's a great idea

2044
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
And I know they do that with Rock Band

2045
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
But some other music games do not

2046
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
So yeah

2047
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
Just Dance on the Wii makes its way to Japan this week

2048
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
And that's it for Japanese releases

2049
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
How about

2050
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000

2051
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
Well in Europe we have

2052
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000

2053
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000

Coming out on the 11th

2055
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000

2056

On the 12th Guardian Heroes for Xbox 360

01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
Which is awesome

2058
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
Orcs Must Die which is the best name ever

2059
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
And then on the 14th we have

2060
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000

Forza Motorsport 4

2063
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Might and Magic Heroes 6

2064
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
PES 2012

2065

Renegade Ops

2066
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
Sesame Street Once Upon a Monster

Bleh

2070
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
Alright

2071
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
Well let's move on

2072
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
With a couple more news stories

2073
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
And then we'll let Dark Sakura have at the classic

2074
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
Game of the Week

2075
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
By the way I just gotta say

2076
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
Part B tonight's gonna be action packed

2077
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
Usually all the good stuff's in Part A

2078
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
But there's like some awesome stuff coming for Part B

2079
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
So I'm just saying for those of you that sometimes

2080
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
Want to tune out halfway through

2081
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
You wanna stick around tonight

2082
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
So I'll tell you why in just a minute

2083
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
So they announced some cool

2084
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
Stuff this week during the

2085
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
Apple press conference

2086
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
Of course the new thing being the iPhone 4S

2087
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
Sorry not iPhone 5

2088
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
But you know what? It's just a name

2089
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
It's seriously just a name

2090
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
Everyone's like, man I'm so bummed they didn't announce

2091
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
The iPhone 5, it's a fucking new

2092
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
iPhone, who cares if they call it

2093
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
iPhone 5, iPhone

2094
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
Fart, it's still a goddamn iPhone

2095
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
I'd buy an iPhone fart

2096
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
Plus the thing that gets me

2097
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
Is that, well there was the 3G

2098
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
And the 3GS and people

2099
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
Didn't get their panties and a bunch about that

2100
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
And quite frankly I'm kinda

2101
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
Glad they're not putting out the iPhone 5 now

2102
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
Because I'm still under contract on the 4

2103
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
I'm not upgrade eligible until January

2104
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
So if there was like that awesome

2105
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
Of a phone coming I would be kind of upset

2106
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
I get to upgrade next month

2107
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
Do you? Yeah. So you can get a 4S

2108
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
Yeah. Alright do you think you'll get one?

2109
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
Yeah. Okay. Oh the dance continue

2110
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
Are you getting excited about Siri?

2111
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
Siri. Explain to me the meaning of life

2112
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
I really don't give a shit about Siri but I'll try it

2113
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
Yeah. So I mean

2114
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
You can try it now. I've read about

2115
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
The Siri pranking on the internet

2116
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
Like some good phrases that people have thought

2117
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Up to yell at like

2118
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
When your friend activates Siri like things

2119
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
That you would yell

2120
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
Siri text my mom that I'm gay

2121
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
Send

2122
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
You know just prank things to uh

2123
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
Send. That's gonna be a

2124
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
Brand new era of damn you

2125
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
Autocorrect. Yes. Yes.

2126
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
It will be. Oh my gosh. Damn you Siri.

2127
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
Michelle. Michelle are you listening? Michelle you better

2128
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
Get that thing registered right now

2129
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
Damn you Siri. Damn you Siri

2130
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
Dot com

2131
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
Alright

2132
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
Um

2133
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
So anyways iPhone 4S is

2134
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
Coming October 14th

2135
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
It adds a brand new processor the A5

2136
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
Processor which is apparently

2137
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Dual core. Up to seven

2138
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
Times the graphics capability

2139
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
And uh enhanced

2140
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
You know camera

2141
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
More RAM

2142
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
All sorts of new features

2143
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
Siri of course as you mentioned

2144
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
Um

2145
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
You know new antenna design

2146
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
GCM or GSM

2147
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
And CDMA radios in the device

2148
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
It's gonna be

2149
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
Available in three different

2150
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
Flavors if you will. 16 gigabyte

2151
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
32 gigabyte and 64 gigabyte

2152
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
Ranging from 199

2153
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
And of course

2154
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
In white or black

2155
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
And of course they're dropping the iPhone 4 down

2156
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
To $99 for the 8

2157
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
Gig model and the 3GS

2158
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
Will apparently be free

2159
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
If you know you have

2160
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
With a plan obviously

2161
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
And that would be the 8 gigabyte model

2162
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
As well

2163
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
Some other fun stuff

2164
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
Of course iOS 5 is coming October 12th

2165
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
And with that they're gonna be bringing

2166
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
iCloud and Airplay

2167
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
To gaming

2168
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
So you'll be able to

2169
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
Play with multiple devices streaming to TVs

2170
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
In fact one of the first games

2171
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
To support that Real Racing 2

2172
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
Will allow you to stream I believe

2173
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
Up to four devices to your TV

2174
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
And do split screen gaming

2175
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
With you know it being on your iPhone

2176
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
I had no idea that this was a feature

2177
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
In it. Did they even talk about this at the press conference?

2178
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
Uh I think they did

2179
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
I slept through it

2180
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
Well I was reading live blogs too

2181
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
Kinda just on my break look

2182
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
And it was like you know showing

2183
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
Was it you can run

2184
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
It of course on your iPhone 4s

2185
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
Or on your iPad 2

2186
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
And stream wirelessly

2187
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
Because before they had it where you can link it up to your TV

2188
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
But you have to hook up an HDMI cable

2189
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
And stuff so

2190
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
And of course along with that you know since the

2191
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
Phone can

2192
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
Have a little bit more horsepower

2193
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
Infinity Blade 2 is coming to

2194
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
And since Apple is the king

2195
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
Of handheld gaming as so they claim

2196
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
This week which is

2197
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
You know the way they spin the numbers

2198
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
Is interesting and I don't doubt it at all

2199
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
But it's uh it's

2200
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
It's interesting

2201
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
Infinity Blade 2 becoming the iOS

2202
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
December 1st of course

2203
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
Is gonna look extra pretty on the 4s

2204
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
But it will be I believe compatible with

2205
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
Other devices as well

2206
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
Of course why would you shut out your other

2207
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
Exactly

2208
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
So yeah very

2209
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
Interesting though

2210
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
Well I want to go back to Siri for a minute

2211
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
Because I forgot about this little commercial I had seen

2212
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
On Facebook and so far that was floating

2213
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
Around the internet and then Tiger Cloud just linked it in

2214
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
Chat and this does have to do with

2215
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
Gaming a little bit this is a commercial

2216
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
For the new Siri feature

2217
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
On the iPhone 4s take a listen

2218
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:45,000
Read me the message

2219
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
New message from Kay bad news

2220
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
Combustible lemons failed

2221
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
And you meet us at 10

2222
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
Reply definitely I'll see you there

2223
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
Play my running mix

2224
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
Oh joy

2225
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
What's the traffic like around here

2226
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
The traffic will be slow and meaningless

2227
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
Just like your sad little life

2228
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
Text my wife I'm gonna be 30 minutes late

2229
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
She won't mind she doesn't really love you anyway

2230
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
Is it going to be chilly in San Francisco this weekend?

2231
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
Not too cold

2232
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
Your few extra pounds should be suitable insulation

2233
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
To keep you warm

2234
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
What about Napa Valley

2235
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
I hear it's beautiful there

2236
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
Unlike you

2237
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
How many cups are in 12 ounces

2238
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
Let me think

2239
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
Do you really need to make those extra cupcakes

2240
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
Set my timer for 30 minutes

2241
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
Okay 30 minutes and counting

2242
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:37,000
Until I end your sad attempt at a life

2243
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:41,000
New notification from Sandy Chen

2244
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
Are we still on for dinner tonight

2245
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
Perhaps you should have a snack instead

2246
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
You're looking a little heavy

2247
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
Reply sure I'll be there

2248
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
Here's your reply to Sandy Chen

2249
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
Sure I will be there

2250
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
Me and my extra 20 pounds

2251
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
Stand

2252
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
Well tell me what I say

2253
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
Interesting because I remember when Apple announced FaceTime

2254
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
It was a huge thing that they used

2255
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
They used deaf people in the commercial

2256
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
And it really did make you think

2257
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
Wow that's a big advance for deaf folks

2258
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
But this one the Siri thing uses blind people

2259
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
To be sending the text messages

2260
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
Which is very very interesting

2261
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
I think it's very neat

2262
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
You wouldn't know it from that parody commercial

2263
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
Because all the jokes are about weight

2264
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
But I just thought that was neat

2265
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
Definitely gets you thinking about some of these advances in technology

2266
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
Anyhow

2267
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
Let's move on with some more

2268
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
Gaming news and this one

2269
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
Has to do with the French

2270
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
A French court has banned

2271
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
A DS game copier

2272
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
Prosecutors won an appeal

2273
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
This was two years after

2274
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
French courts actually ruled

2275
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
That DS flash cartridge sellers were okay

2276
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
Well the Paris court of appeals

2277
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
Actually has now ruled against

2278
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
The DS flash cartridge sellers

2279
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
These various companies

2280
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
That sell devices like the

2281
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
R4 device which I think you all know

2282
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
What that is

2283
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
Nintendo I guess said that the companies

2284
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
Have been charged 460,000 euros

2285
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
In criminal fines

2286
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
And 4.8 million in damages

2287
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
To Nintendo

2288
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
Yikes

2289
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
So hmm

2290
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
I guess Nintendo has been taking action on piracy

2291
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
All over the globe

2292
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
And they even have a site I love it

2293
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
There was a site with a very

2294
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
Angry looking Mario on it

2295
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
That discusses the piracy

2296
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
Thought it was interesting

2297
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
So there you go

2298
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
It's a thing

2299
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
And you know what?

2300
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
I wonder if there will be an appeal to the appeal

2301
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
That would be what would be next right?

2302
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
It is the French Rob

2303
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
I mean please

2304
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
They'll have to surrender all their copying devices immediately

2305
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
I couldn't resist

2306
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
Don't get mad

2307
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
I'm not mad

2308
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
I see it

2309
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
You look great

2310
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
Whoo

2311
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
What a game of the week

2312
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Are we the throughout guards

2313
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
You have 30 seconds we got a suggestion

2314
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,560
Our hot in

2315
01:20:37,560 --> 01:20:39,560
Come open the video

2316
01:20:39,560 --> 01:20:41,560
I need that

2317
01:20:41,560 --> 01:20:43,560
Come open the video

2318
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:45,420
AB.

2319
01:20:45,420 --> 01:20:55,860
that came out in 1983 when I was years old I love the music in this game a

2320
01:20:55,860 --> 01:21:02,260
little too happy I think well anyway um it was put up by Namco and in the u.s. it

2321
01:21:02,260 --> 01:21:06,900
was manufactured and distributed by Valley Midway it is a side-scrolling

2322
01:21:06,900 --> 01:21:15,580
platformer that has a police mouse and some cats and Mappy basically the game

2323
01:21:15,580 --> 01:21:20,820
runs on Namco's super pac-man hardware so that's and they modified it to have

2324
01:21:20,820 --> 01:21:26,460
the horizontal scrolling and it comes from the bulb at least according to the

2325
01:21:26,460 --> 01:21:30,620
article it says that it's derived from the term mapo which is a slightly

2326
01:21:30,620 --> 01:21:35,500
insulting name for a policeman whoo so anyway basically you run through a

2327
01:21:35,500 --> 01:21:39,260
mansion with all these cats club new keys or in the u.s. they were called

2328
01:21:39,260 --> 01:21:46,180
meow keys and you rescue stolen goods you go left and right and you can jump

2329
01:21:46,180 --> 01:21:52,540
on these trampolines that will bounce you to different floors and you have one

2330
01:21:52,540 --> 01:21:56,300
button that lets you open and close doors so you can get a radio 400 points

2331
01:21:56,300 --> 01:22:01,180
a television for 200 a computer for 300 the Mona Lisa for 400 and a safe for 500

2332
01:22:01,180 --> 01:22:05,220
but they come in pairs wait how many copies of the Mona Lisa exist I have no

2333
01:22:05,220 --> 01:22:11,540
friggin clue not in Mappy land which is another game ha ha there was a Mappy

2334
01:22:11,540 --> 01:22:17,500
land hi there was and it's sitting in my room in the vault so at any rate if you

2335
01:22:17,500 --> 01:22:22,540
get one item and then get its pair you actually get a score multiplier so the

2336
01:22:22,540 --> 01:22:28,460
more of those that you get without dying the bigger the multiplier gets so you

2337
01:22:28,460 --> 01:22:32,140
want to start off at the lowest and go to the highest you can actually get 8500

2338
01:22:32,140 --> 01:22:37,100
points and so moving for yeah he bounces on trampolines that are in the house

2339
01:22:37,100 --> 01:22:42,380
because I don't know why a mansion has trampolines in it but it does and Mappy

2340
01:22:42,380 --> 01:22:48,660
because they're fun Mappy and the cats can only land on a floor on the way up

2341
01:22:48,660 --> 01:22:54,100
not on the way down but if they pass the air the cats won't hurt Mappy but if

2342
01:22:54,100 --> 01:22:57,940
they run into him when he's on the plot on a platform then he will lose a life

2343
01:22:57,940 --> 01:23:02,460
and the trampolines can break if you jump on them four times in a row they'll

2344
01:23:02,460 --> 01:23:11,660
change colors so basically as you go through the game there is a boss in the

2345
01:23:11,660 --> 01:23:19,980
game called nyamco which is basically a play on the word namco and nyanco which

2346
01:23:19,980 --> 01:23:28,060
is like kitty cat but in the u.s. he was named Goro and he's faster but a little

2347
01:23:28,060 --> 01:23:34,180
less aggressive and so you can he'll actually hide behind different objects

2348
01:23:34,180 --> 01:23:39,620
so if you go over the object that he's hiding behind you get a thousand points

2349
01:23:39,620 --> 01:23:44,580
for having caught him so it's kind of cool you've got different hallways like

2350
01:23:44,580 --> 01:23:48,180
I said you can open and shut doors and keep the mukies out and you have

2351
01:23:48,180 --> 01:23:52,380
microwave doors which release sound waves that will sweep the kitty cats

2352
01:23:52,380 --> 01:23:57,620
away did you say microwave doors yeah microwave doors they made popcorn

2353
01:23:57,620 --> 01:24:01,060
sounds wish that they were like I always consider them to be like sound waves

2354
01:24:01,060 --> 01:24:04,540
which makes more sense to me but apparently they're microwaves so good

2355
01:24:04,540 --> 01:24:12,700
thing so um basically after every bonus round you did get bonus rounds after the

2356
01:24:12,700 --> 01:24:16,940
every fourth level so it's a bonus round and so that's basically you running

2357
01:24:16,940 --> 01:24:21,820
around on trampolines popping different balloons and nyamco is hidden somewhere

2358
01:24:21,820 --> 01:24:26,700
in there and after the bonus run you get a new feature in the gameplay after the

2359
01:24:26,700 --> 01:24:32,860
first one you get attics although there's nothing in them you get after

2360
01:24:32,860 --> 01:24:38,100
the seventh bonus level you get bells so you can get bells that freeze the cats

2361
01:24:38,100 --> 01:24:43,660
300 points for each and a thousand points for stunning nyamco you also get

2362
01:24:43,660 --> 01:24:48,340
hurry signs you know that tell you speed the fuck up you get rainbow floors after

2363
01:24:48,340 --> 01:24:53,980
the 11th which basically they're mini floors they vanish and they leave a hole

2364
01:24:53,980 --> 01:24:56,340
in the hallway sorry I didn't mean to interrupt if you guys are doing any

2365
01:24:56,340 --> 01:25:00,220
excess downloading kill it because we're having buffering problems the live

2366
01:25:00,220 --> 01:25:03,940
listeners are anything I'm gonna tell anything that's out of my control then

2367
01:25:03,940 --> 01:25:07,980
yeah our upload will upload and then kind of freeze on a number for a minute

2368
01:25:07,980 --> 01:25:10,620
and then keep going and it's causing the listeners to be all like what's going on

2369
01:25:10,620 --> 01:25:17,020
all right well I closed a few things so maybe that'll help right but anyway you

2370
01:25:17,020 --> 01:25:20,060
just get all these different bonuses including the Rainbow Force and dead ends

2371
01:25:20,060 --> 01:25:27,580
there are 256 rounds just like impact man and the last one is normal but

2372
01:25:27,580 --> 01:25:32,540
harder than usual and if you finish it it's also known as round zero the first

2373
01:25:32,540 --> 01:25:37,140
round starts over again it came out in the Famicom and the nest of course and

2374
01:25:37,140 --> 01:25:44,700
the MSX in 1984 there was a video game console version only I'm sorry console

2375
01:25:44,700 --> 01:25:48,540
only version that was called Mappy land which we've discussed it came out in

2376
01:25:48,540 --> 01:25:55,740
1986 it was also released from Microsoft revenge of the arcade for PC in 1998 and

2377
01:25:55,740 --> 01:26:00,100
then there were Japanese only sequels that were hopping Mappy that came out in

2378
01:26:00,100 --> 01:26:04,740
the arcade and Mappy kids for the Famicom in the late 1980s there's Mappy

2379
01:26:04,740 --> 01:26:09,460
arrangement that came out in the Namco classics volume one which I've got the

2380
01:26:09,460 --> 01:26:12,700
Famicom version of the original Mappy was re-released in Japan as part of the

2381
01:26:12,700 --> 01:26:17,180
Famicom miniseries in 2004 Mappy is included on the miss pac-man collection

2382
01:26:17,180 --> 01:26:22,100
and it's also featured in the Namco Museum 50th anniversary collection that

2383
01:26:22,100 --> 01:26:26,060

2387
01:26:41,180 --> 01:26:47,100

2419
01:29:20,660 --> 01:29:25,740
supposed to do but as you guys know I was at Disneyland Disneyland last week

2420
01:29:25,740 --> 01:29:30,940

want to hear your reaction I love you guys forever

2424
01:29:49,020 --> 01:29:53,380
okay since that's terrible radio because you can't see it's a Duffy hat is what I

2425
01:29:53,380 --> 01:29:57,560
got her it's a little it's a Mickey hat but it's in Duffy so that's from Alan

2426
01:29:57,560 --> 01:30:04,700
and myself what's Duffy Duffy is Duffy is the Disney Bear and actually Dan

2427
01:30:04,700 --> 01:30:08,580
calls him the special the the focused interest group bear now did the other

2428
01:30:08,580 --> 01:30:12,820
thing there's another thing is it's really small did it fall out or no it's

2429
01:30:12,820 --> 01:30:19,820
still in the hat then where did oh I see what he did with it yes it's right there

2430
01:30:23,180 --> 01:30:28,260
so she's screaming into a not into a microphone but it's a Duffy pin that she

2431
01:30:28,260 --> 01:30:32,860
doesn't have so there you go yep that's from Alan and I oh you get your

2432

2433
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:40,320
right now on orange is ready to calm Duffy is the Disney Bear and he's much

2434
01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:43,300
pop he's kind of like build a bear because he has all these different

2435
01:30:43,300 --> 01:30:46,580
outfits and so forth but you don't actually build him he's already kind of

2436
01:30:46,580 --> 01:30:50,700
prearranged and I like the fur the first really kind of a neat texture but he's

2437
01:30:50,700 --> 01:30:56,580
really big in Disney Tokyo I don't know why but they love him there because they

2438
01:30:56,580 --> 01:31:01,420
like everything new and focus group oriented I mean hi so there you go I

2439
01:31:01,420 --> 01:31:06,980
love Duffy so much and I can't wait until we get Shelley May Shelley May is

2440
01:31:06,980 --> 01:31:12,820
like Duffy's little girlfriend and she's cute too all right well there you go

2441
01:31:12,820 --> 01:31:16,260
that's the thank you from us for watching the cats and I suppose a little

2442
01:31:16,260 --> 01:31:22,180
bit taking over you know the administration of the show all right

2443
01:31:22,180 --> 01:31:25,340
let's move on I'm wearing me ears all night read you some rapid-fire news so

2444
01:31:25,340 --> 01:31:29,940
Loki wants to start us off all right well there's a new project headed up by

2445
01:31:29,940 --> 01:31:36,220
Kenji Inafune and it's revealed as a game called king of pirates and that's

2446
01:31:36,220 --> 01:31:42,180
coming to the 3ds in 2012 now not too much has been asked by it's a a pirate

2447
01:31:42,180 --> 01:31:45,860
action game it takes place on a giant ocean it looks very similar to maybe

2448
01:31:45,860 --> 01:31:52,580
like a Zelda type game or something like that and it is I guess published by

2449
01:31:52,580 --> 01:31:58,940
marvelous a a QL the makers of the harvest moon series and right now it's

2450
01:31:58,940 --> 01:32:03,100
only slated for Japan but who knows maybe it'll eventually come out over

2451
01:32:03,100 --> 01:32:08,780
here in North America so that's pretty cool let's see these actually working on

2452
01:32:08,780 --> 01:32:14,140
something other than you know nothing since he got canned from Capcom or he

2453
01:32:14,140 --> 01:32:23,620
left Capcom whatever uh la noir the team behind it team Bondi is shutting down I

2454
01:32:23,620 --> 01:32:27,100
can see why I can see in this that game I think was delayed and delayed and

2455
01:32:27,100 --> 01:32:34,140
delayed and delayed and delayed some more but how that would be the delay

2456
01:32:34,140 --> 01:32:38,420
music here there how's that different from any other freaking video game out

2457
01:32:38,420 --> 01:32:45,580
there it's like years I mean I don't know but anyways um apparently though

2458
01:32:45,580 --> 01:32:52,580
they're seeing that la noir was you know a big hit obviously however though

2459
01:32:52,580 --> 01:32:57,980
because it was in development for seven years it took its toll on the staff in

2460
01:32:57,980 --> 01:33:02,140
the company because of that they're just kind of dissolving that is a long damn

2461
01:33:02,140 --> 01:33:06,540
time for a game to be in the studio entered in administration in August and

2462
01:33:06,540 --> 01:33:14,660
its assets are being sold to an Australian production company Kennedy

2463
01:33:14,660 --> 01:33:22,500
Miller Mitchell so yeah it is being closed and then finally this is kind of

2464
01:33:22,500 --> 01:33:30,660
cool battlefield 3 is gonna ship on multiple this on xbox 360 and you know

2465
01:33:30,660 --> 01:33:35,380
they have one you know disc is dedicated for the single player and then the

2466
01:33:35,380 --> 01:33:40,100
second disc is multiplayer but also on that second disc is something else it is

2467
01:33:40,100 --> 01:33:45,540
an optional install that you can do that only give you high res it will be a

2468
01:33:45,540 --> 01:33:49,300
higher resolution texture pack so make the game look prettier if you want to

2469
01:33:49,300 --> 01:33:52,740
install it to your hard drive that's kind of neat I think that's kind of cool

2470
01:33:52,740 --> 01:33:58,420
that's really smart so maybe that will make things look a little bit better I'm

2471
01:33:58,420 --> 01:34:02,540
assuming it probably pretty much the same as playstation 3 since obviously

2472
01:34:02,540 --> 01:34:09,820
blu-ray discs have a lot more storage space but that is kind of cool if you're

2473
01:34:09,820 --> 01:34:13,700
gonna have to despise utilize all of the space right that's a neat idea wonder

2474
01:34:13,700 --> 01:34:19,380
if other companies will copy that in the future like rage all right well let's

2475
01:34:19,380 --> 01:34:25,860
move on to a story about VVVVVV and this is about the VVVVVV on the 3ds we're

2476
01:34:25,860 --> 01:34:30,180
talking about this earlier yep you heard me VVVVVV on the 3ds and it's supposed

2477
01:34:30,180 --> 01:34:33,900
to be out later this year so we're not talking about something next year it's

2478
01:34:33,900 --> 01:34:38,180
later this year it's supposed to be available on the 3ds e-shop and it will

2479
01:34:38,180 --> 01:34:45,420
have some 3d effects now you have to remember VVVVVV is based off of a it's

2480
01:34:45,420 --> 01:34:49,500
not based off of it it's highly inspired by a Commodore 64 game so that's the

2481
01:34:49,500 --> 01:34:53,500
style of the graphics so I'm very curious what exactly they're gonna 3d

2482
01:34:53,500 --> 01:34:58,700
ties with this I'm assuming the sprites are in front textures and back I don't

2483
01:34:58,700 --> 01:35:03,380
know so we'll see what they do with the 3d effects on this also the way they

2484
01:35:03,380 --> 01:35:06,420
will utilize the double screen is that the bottom touchscreen will always show

2485
01:35:06,420 --> 01:35:10,060
the map and the top screen will show the game that you're used to how do you

2486
01:35:10,060 --> 01:35:13,660
think that'll look on a 3ds I think it'd be cool but I'm worried though because

2487
01:35:13,660 --> 01:35:17,740
being that the game is very frustrating and you may want to throw your controller

2488
01:35:17,740 --> 01:35:22,260
throwing the 3ds is probably not a good idea yeah not a good idea they need to

2489
01:35:22,260 --> 01:35:25,260
put like a little attachment on a 3ds it's like a stress squeeze ball

2490
01:35:25,260 --> 01:35:30,340
something you can squeeze and get really pissed off so all right also information

2491
01:35:30,340 --> 01:35:34,940
about Mario Kart 7 which is exciting coming out on the 3ds soon Mario Kart

2492
01:35:34,940 --> 01:35:42,540
7 the Donkey Kong Returns folks that's right retro studios apparently actually

2493
01:35:42,540 --> 01:35:46,780
helped develop the Donkey Kong Returns themed level in the game which I think

2494
01:35:46,780 --> 01:35:52,420
is really cool so that's yep some of the stuff they helped with on the game so I

2495
01:35:52,420 --> 01:35:55,860
and I like I can see a little bit of the track in here and it looks pretty cool I

2496
01:35:55,860 --> 01:36:00,500
do like the whole like Mario's has a different variety of cars and the

2497
01:36:00,500 --> 01:36:03,140
hang gliders and all that although Loki's not as much of a fan I think

2498
01:36:03,140 --> 01:36:06,820
it'll be kind of cool and I noticed in this one Donkey Kong is riding like this

2499
01:36:06,820 --> 01:36:10,660
giant tractor looking thing which looks funny they've had different types of

2500
01:36:10,660 --> 01:36:16,580
cars before in the other games it's just stupid but never that flies where they

2501
01:36:16,580 --> 01:36:22,740
fly now big deal all right in a fun a cagey in a fun a who of course was the

2502
01:36:22,740 --> 01:36:26,820

2506
01:36:38,340 --> 01:36:43,540

2507
01:36:43,540 --> 01:36:49,300
Genesis game but it was castle illusion starring Mickey Mouse and it is targeted

2508
01:36:49,300 --> 01:36:52,460
at a video game software so maybe they're gonna re-release it who knows

2509
01:36:52,460 --> 01:36:58,220
maybe we get in a virtual console also rock band there is going to be a

2510

01:37:25,020 --> 01:37:31,820
dream theater is that's pretty cool and last but never least Steven Spielberg

2516
01:37:31,820 --> 01:37:41,500
and DreamWorks are backing a halo movie to come out in 2000 false and let me

2517
01:37:41,500 --> 01:37:51,420
finish thank you for getting sorry it was stated to Microsoft denied that it

2518
01:37:51,420 --> 01:37:57,020
was in development they go on record saying that it is inaccurate and they

2519
01:37:57,020 --> 01:38:00,820
have no plan for halo feature right now their focus is developing halo

2520
01:38:00,820 --> 01:38:05,340
anniversary in halo 4 we all know it's gonna happen eventually though well I

2521
01:38:05,340 --> 01:38:11,500
mean someday it'll be terrible but then again you know I've talked a lot about

2522
01:38:11,500 --> 01:38:14,620
the Wow movie before and the World of Warcraft movie I don't think that's ever

2523
01:38:14,620 --> 01:38:18,300
gonna happen at this point like I think they they missed their chance a couple

2524
01:38:18,300 --> 01:38:22,380
years ago that sound like a terrible idea well it could have been good but it

2525
01:38:22,380 --> 01:38:26,980
probably would have been we all know would have been all right guys and we

2526
01:38:26,980 --> 01:38:31,580
have some big stuff to share you ready we're gonna make a phone call to our old

2527
01:38:31,580 --> 01:38:37,580
friend why why are who's gonna talk to us about his upcoming project that he's

2528
01:38:37,580 --> 01:38:43,380
doing on xbox live indie games we're gonna call right now hello zero zero

2529
01:38:43,380 --> 01:38:50,460
one two three four five six what that's what it says on the caller ID I was

2530
01:38:50,460 --> 01:38:54,580
Skype is really funny when it does that it's it's funny things over the call ID

2531
01:38:54,580 --> 01:39:02,340
so why why are how are you doing sir um I think I'll be better once I have time

2532
01:39:02,340 --> 01:39:07,420
to get some sleep but I am kind of excited for New York comic-con later

2533
01:39:07,420 --> 01:39:14,740
this week and I'm just doing doing what I can to you know get get done what I

2534
01:39:14,740 --> 01:39:19,660
need to do on the two games I'm showing you know so that I don't look like

2535
01:39:19,660 --> 01:39:22,980
complete crap when I'm there so yeah you you've been doing a lot of these

2536
01:39:22,980 --> 01:39:26,420
conventions and I I bet that's been a really good kind of exposure and help

2537
01:39:26,420 --> 01:39:29,340
for you because you know I know I knew you were at PAX East a while ago and I

2538
01:39:29,340 --> 01:39:33,340
think you did it again actually twice now yeah now you got the comic-con

2539
01:39:33,340 --> 01:39:37,460
coming up it's it's pretty exciting so it is and I'll tell you honestly I

2540
01:39:37,460 --> 01:39:41,460
haven't gotten a single major gaming site to cover me yet and I'm hoping

2541
01:39:41,460 --> 01:39:45,260
maybe it'll be different this time but to be completely honest I think the

2542
01:39:45,260 --> 01:39:50,140
major reason I'm doing it is just to put my put my stuff in front of gamers and

2543
01:39:50,140 --> 01:39:54,620
to see them you know enjoy playing my stuff like to have a bunch of people

2544
01:39:54,620 --> 01:40:00,060
crowded around snake 360 battle mode you know that that gets me every time like I

2545
01:40:00,060 --> 01:40:03,660
love to see that that's all right even if even if there's no chance that I'll

2546
01:40:03,660 --> 01:40:09,240
be commercially successful just seeing that is enough for me to be honest screw

2547
01:40:09,240 --> 01:40:13,540
the big game sites you don't get any much you got us you got us we got your

2548
01:40:13,540 --> 01:40:17,420
back all right so speaking of which um you you are you said you're gonna be

2549
01:40:17,420 --> 01:40:20,900
showing two games in New York comic-con right so what's what what's the one

2550
01:40:20,900 --> 01:40:24,900
we're already supposed to know about well the first one is the latest

2551
01:40:24,900 --> 01:40:30,780
available build of snake 361 and right obviously the sequel to snake 360 and

2552
01:40:30,780 --> 01:40:35,420
there's a lot of stuff a lot of stuff that's going to be in the new one I mean

2553
01:40:35,420 --> 01:40:40,060
levels that grow in the campaign because I got criticized about well you know

2554
01:40:40,060 --> 01:40:44,180
snake is a game about avoiding yourself and well as soon as you get long enough

2555
01:40:44,180 --> 01:40:49,220
where it's a challenge the levels done and then you start over so in this game

2556
01:40:49,220 --> 01:40:54,180
you know the campaign has levels that grow as you do and then your challenge

2557
01:40:54,180 --> 01:40:58,380
to continue going at the length that you're at through a two three four even

2558
01:40:58,380 --> 01:41:02,820
more part level so that's one thing and then there are other things like

2559
01:41:02,820 --> 01:41:06,680
survival mode there's still the traditional one but then there's a you

2560
01:41:06,680 --> 01:41:10,560
know three and five minute you know score rush where you know you're gonna

2561
01:41:10,560 --> 01:41:14,020
have to take more risks because you only have that much time and then there's

2562
01:41:14,020 --> 01:41:18,460
something that's really unique and really fun called dual survival and the

2563
01:41:18,460 --> 01:41:22,180
way that works is every time you take a target you turn around you reverse

2564
01:41:22,180 --> 01:41:26,140
direction oh god oh you always have to be keeping track of where your head and

2565
01:41:26,140 --> 01:41:30,900
your tail are it's a lot of fun and it's a really really great challenge my I

2566
01:41:30,900 --> 01:41:34,500
love how you've kind of taken the concept of snake from the old-school

2567
01:41:34,500 --> 01:41:39,580
cell phones and just turned it into this just complex game in a way you know it's

2568
01:41:39,580 --> 01:41:43,100
not all actually you know you've given it some more dimensions you know you

2569
01:41:43,100 --> 01:41:46,540
should feel a battle mode now there's there's even more modifiers there's like

2570
01:41:46,540 --> 01:41:52,380
I'm gonna have seven modifiers available at comic-con and you can turn them all

2571
01:41:52,380 --> 01:41:58,180
on if you want and it's just like you know everything from dead players

2572
01:41:58,180 --> 01:42:03,260
remaining on the field when you die to again reversing direction every time you

2573
01:42:03,260 --> 01:42:10,900
take a target to the level continuously shrinking it's it's just got a lot of

2574
01:42:10,900 --> 01:42:15,460
stuff in there and but the one of the new things I'm premiering at comic-con

2575
01:42:15,460 --> 01:42:18,500
is something called the challenge mode eventually they're going to be a hundred

2576
01:42:18,500 --> 01:42:22,340
different challenges but at comic-con they're just ten and it's just you know

2577
01:42:22,340 --> 01:42:27,260
a scenario okay you're here you're in this level you have to do this you have

2578
01:42:27,260 --> 01:42:31,540
this much time you have this many movements here are the restrictions okay

2579
01:42:31,540 --> 01:42:36,740
go and I'm also gonna have a contest if there's anybody who can clear the four

2580
01:42:36,740 --> 01:42:40,580
hardest challenges that I bring with me in five attempts they can win a year of

2581
01:42:40,580 --> 01:42:45,020
lives but to be honest I don't think anyone's going to be able to rule you

2582
01:42:45,020 --> 01:42:50,340
throwing down the gauntlet all right nice someone thinks they can come prove

2583
01:42:50,340 --> 01:42:54,180
me wrong then they're they're quite welcome nice by the way why we are is

2584
01:42:54,180 --> 01:42:57,020
live with us this isn't a pre-recorded thing so if you have questions in our

2585
01:42:57,020 --> 01:43:01,740
chat room go ahead and ask them chat orange launch radio.com I know you're

2586
01:43:01,740 --> 01:43:05,140
really excited about snake 361 and and so are we it's it's looking to be a

2587
01:43:05,140 --> 01:43:11,340
great game but I got to tell you I want to talk about project number two well

2588
01:43:11,340 --> 01:43:16,140
you know what the seeds for project number two were planted a long time

2589
01:43:16,140 --> 01:43:22,980
ago if you can recall shortly after you know sneak 360 came out and I talked

2590
01:43:22,980 --> 01:43:28,380
about it right here on OLR you know what one of the weeks like immediately after

2591
01:43:28,380 --> 01:43:33,300
that you know you guys were throwing around some ideas and it's funny I don't

2592
01:43:33,300 --> 01:43:37,120
have the chat log but I do distinctly remember that someone was like hey why

2593
01:43:37,120 --> 01:43:43,340
why are get on that and at the time I didn't but I was just thinking about it

2594
01:43:43,340 --> 01:43:47,580
and and sometime this summer I said you know what I think I'm going to get on it

2595
01:43:47,580 --> 01:43:57,760
so I threw together a trailer last night that you know kind of brings back brings

2596
01:43:57,760 --> 01:44:02,820
back something about you know that it basically I have your discussion in

2597
01:44:02,820 --> 01:44:08,500
there and yeah it's really the trailer speaks for itself it speaks better than

2598
01:44:08,500 --> 01:44:12,780
I ever could so why don't we take it away then I'm gonna play this year in

2599
01:44:12,780 --> 01:44:15,780
studio the trailer and I think you're gonna link it for our chatters if they

2600
01:44:15,780 --> 01:44:19,100
want to see it and we will also now I know I thought originally this is a

2601
01:44:19,100 --> 01:44:22,120
YouTube but it's not so we'll figure out a way to get it on tumblr for the

2602
01:44:22,120 --> 01:44:28,160
podcast easy just uploaded it's a direct it's a direct link to an mp4 download on

2603
01:44:28,160 --> 01:44:33,500
my site to be honest most people when they click on it either it'll just play

2604
01:44:33,500 --> 01:44:36,860
or they'll be able to download it to their desktop there'll be a very very

2605
01:44:36,860 --> 01:44:40,660
very brief delay while it downloads because it's not very big and then it'll

2606
01:44:40,660 --> 01:44:46,700
play so you know for most people and of course mp4 is a format that pretty much

2607
01:44:46,700 --> 01:44:51,860
everybody can play most phones even should be able to handle it so I'll get

2608
01:44:51,860 --> 01:44:55,280
it on the tumblr and I'm sure people can figure it out we got smart listeners so

2609
01:44:55,280 --> 01:44:59,740
here it is the world premiere of the secret project the yyr has been working

2610
01:44:59,740 --> 01:45:06,260
on that apparently we have had a hand in unknowingly so here we go start off here

2611
01:45:06,260 --> 01:45:10,700
of course now I just have to wait for the buffering I just have to wait for

2612
01:45:10,700 --> 01:45:16,540
the buffering now I should have loaded this in advance yeah shame on me good

2613
01:45:16,540 --> 01:45:19,700
job you'll live you'll learn this is this would have been a great time to

2614
01:45:19,700 --> 01:45:22,940
talk about more are you doing any other live appearances this year besides New

2615
01:45:22,940 --> 01:45:28,180
York comic-con next after this is going to be magfest in January alright which

2616
01:45:28,180 --> 01:45:34,900
is in the DC area and it's just one big orgasm of gaming and music and gaming

2617
01:45:34,900 --> 01:45:38,940
related music and it's just it's amazing hold on loaded it loaded we gotta play

2618
01:45:38,940 --> 01:45:42,300
it I've never seen so many video games in a room before it loaded here we go

2619
01:45:42,300 --> 01:45:52,900
we on the DS there it return the ferret I command II need to put it like on a bungee cord

2620
01:45:52,900 --> 01:45:57,260
you just put it on a bungee cord so every time you throw it you can yank it back it's

2621
01:45:57,260 --> 01:46:01,260
not that I should be encouraging you to do this well wait you know what they

2622
01:46:01,260 --> 01:46:04,940
need to do wait since we've been talking community games and all this stuff and

2623
01:46:04,940 --> 01:46:09,020
and all this good Xbox I think shouldn't they have a game called bungee ferret

2624
01:46:09,020 --> 01:46:12,940
tossing it could be like orange launch radio presents bungee ferret toss add

2625
01:46:12,940 --> 01:46:17,540
this to the list of orange launch radio dream games or no I add this to the

2626
01:46:17,540 --> 01:46:21,060
list of orange launch radio reality games I would like to see about the

2627
01:46:21,060 --> 01:46:24,900
dream game we need to learn how to program or something have a series of

2628
01:46:24,900 --> 01:46:27,900
games that are soccer you're in school helping take a class on programming

2629
01:46:33,620 --> 01:46:38,660
our ferret engineers have created time ferrets with a two-second views this is

2630
01:46:38,660 --> 01:46:45,780
great and you've got a guy dangling from a helicopter and he is throwing ferrets

2631
01:46:45,780 --> 01:46:52,180
that explode that explode in bloody messes on the unsuspecting people below

2632
01:46:52,180 --> 01:46:56,180
who are shooting at you who are shooting missiles at you while you fly around it

2633
01:46:56,180 --> 01:47:01,980
is bungee ferret tossing inspired by olr for better or worse it will be playable

2634
01:47:01,980 --> 01:47:07,020
at New York comic-con coming to Xbox 360 later this year from I guess a new

2635
01:47:07,020 --> 01:47:12,940
division that you're working with MRG yeah well it's you know what I came up

2636
01:47:12,940 --> 01:47:19,540
with an alternate name MRG mostly random games and because basically like my

2637
01:47:19,540 --> 01:47:23,460
label while our games have always been about just straight-up serious arcade

2638
01:47:23,460 --> 01:47:28,340
style games right and well this is anything but serious so I wanted to just

2639
01:47:28,340 --> 01:47:32,620
separated slightly I understand I understand I understand I'm having so

2640
01:47:32,620 --> 01:47:36,060
much fun with this like and everyone who's tried it so far really loves the

2641
01:47:36,060 --> 01:47:40,620
concept and to be completely honest the graphics like they're as with my other

2642
01:47:40,620 --> 01:47:43,820
games they're nothing special and I'm considering having a lot of them

2643
01:47:43,820 --> 01:47:49,100
redrawn by someone a little more professional than me but it's everyone

2644
01:47:49,100 --> 01:47:52,620
who's tried it so far they really like the way it plays because basically the

2645
01:47:52,620 --> 01:48:00,260
thing is you're fighting terrorism of course the ferrets have to fight I want

2646
01:48:00,260 --> 01:48:06,040
to make you a flyer he's got New York comic-con coming up Friday you should

2647
01:48:06,040 --> 01:48:10,820
always probably had I actually have something in the printer and by the way

2648
01:48:10,820 --> 01:48:14,900
there's a big red box on it that says you know the concept of bungee carrot

2649
01:48:14,900 --> 01:48:19,240
tossing is a joke never throw an animal in real life it's good knowing PETA on

2650
01:48:19,240 --> 01:48:23,680
your ass unless you can assure me he'll just land with a splat she's too heavy

2651
01:48:23,680 --> 01:48:27,580
to throw although it could be completely honest I wouldn't be a hundred percent

2652
01:48:27,580 --> 01:48:31,460
sad if PETA was on my ass because they say any publicity is good publicity

2653
01:48:31,460 --> 01:48:34,420
right that's true so what so what are you controlling in the game are you

2654
01:48:34,420 --> 01:48:39,040
controlling the helicopter well this is a great example I think of a game that

2655
01:48:39,040 --> 01:48:43,620
would not be possible in its current form on a smartphone or on something that

2656
01:48:43,620 --> 01:48:47,700
doesn't have you know thumbsticks and buttons this is this is going to be I

2657
01:48:47,700 --> 01:48:53,940
think a great you know piece of ammo in the war on you know oh well cell phones

2658
01:48:53,940 --> 01:48:58,140
can do everything smartphones can do all kinds of games because basically the way

2659
01:48:58,140 --> 01:49:02,300
this game works is using the left thumb stick you control the helicopters

2660
01:49:02,300 --> 01:49:06,500
movement and using the right thumb stick you can control the guy you know the

2661
01:49:06,500 --> 01:49:10,660
dude I call them hanging on the end of the helicopter if you push the right

2662
01:49:10,660 --> 01:49:14,340
stick up and down you can control the cord length doesn't dude name and right

2663
01:49:14,340 --> 01:49:18,660
you can swing wait we need to give dude a name like the hero needs a name

2664
01:49:18,660 --> 01:49:27,540
Fernando Fernando sure okay I don't like the apple song yeah the drums Fernando

2665
01:49:27,540 --> 01:49:32,220
his name is Fernando I guess we named your guy Fernando yes I'm writing it

2666
01:49:32,220 --> 01:49:38,260
down for SSJ 100 Matt here with me actually right if he's a little surprised

2667
01:49:38,260 --> 01:49:41,940
that I'm writing it down but you know what I'm gonna forget it how could you

2668
01:49:41,940 --> 01:49:46,660
forget about a song that's kidding well I got so much stuff I'm actually I

2669
01:49:46,660 --> 01:49:50,940
started the day with no music and sound effects in the game now they're all done

2670
01:49:50,940 --> 01:49:57,820
and I have to put them in so it's been busy but yeah so anyway Fernando here

2671
01:49:57,820 --> 01:50:02,200
he's fighting terrorists we discover the location of their base in the dead

2672
01:50:02,200 --> 01:50:06,980
but the thing is they have advanced stealth radar detection technology so we

2673
01:50:06,980 --> 01:50:10,900
can't send in the army so instead we send in one stealth helicopter and

2674
01:50:10,900 --> 01:50:15,780
Fernando who is armed with the latest in ferret weapons technology now you know

2675
01:50:15,780 --> 01:50:19,580
how they have in movies they have like oh let's show the schematics and you get

2676
01:50:19,580 --> 01:50:23,940
this screen with like a green grid and on top there's some kind of wireframe

2677
01:50:23,940 --> 01:50:29,780
image of some you know complicated technology in in the opening sequence

2678
01:50:29,780 --> 01:50:33,060
when it's eventually done you're gonna see that except it's just going to be

2679
01:50:33,060 --> 01:50:41,720
ferret dynamite that is amazing third weapons technology and then at the end

2680
01:50:41,720 --> 01:50:45,760
of the game you realize that the terrorists have somehow reverse

2681
01:50:45,760 --> 01:50:50,740
engineered the ferret weapons technology and they attempt to use it on you so you

2682
01:50:50,740 --> 01:50:55,100
know that that's an exciting little thing waiting for you at the end of the

2683
01:50:55,100 --> 01:51:00,140
game although there's there may be depending on time an alternate boss at

2684
01:51:00,140 --> 01:51:05,100
the end of hard mode that actually Matt here came up with and it's just as

2685
01:51:05,100 --> 01:51:10,140
ridiculous as the game concept itself and hopefully I can get that in there so

2686
01:51:10,140 --> 01:51:17,580
you all can laugh at it well I gotta say I am just sure me stat but on behalf of

2687
01:51:17,580 --> 01:51:22,340
all of us I'm just like I'm like I'm tickle seriously yeah I think tickled is

2688
01:51:22,340 --> 01:51:28,460

2692
01:51:40,820 --> 01:51:48,100

2693
01:51:48,100 --> 01:51:51,560

why we are in his games he's the guy behind such games like snake 360 and now

2721
01:54:00,540 --> 01:54:09,460
snake 361 falling and now bungee ferret tossing is gonna be awesome looking

2722
01:54:09,460 --> 01:54:13,700
forward to that all right um what'd you guys think isn't that great that's

2723
01:54:13,700 --> 01:54:18,340
that's the most awesome thing of our Loki Loki was convinced it was gonna be

2724
01:54:18,340 --> 01:54:22,020
grandma's got guns I was hoping maybe you know but here's the thing here's the

2725
01:54:22,020 --> 01:54:25,900
thing if this game does really well like like imagine if it's like on the top of

2726
01:54:25,900 --> 01:54:29,100
the sales bar and we I think we have a responsibility to get the word out and

2727
01:54:29,100 --> 01:54:33,020
make sure that this does top the sales charts then what's gonna happen is

2728
01:54:33,020 --> 01:54:36,580
people are gonna be like wow this game is going good wow those people olr like

2729
01:54:36,580 --> 01:54:39,900
full are really good ideas we need to start adapting some of their other games

2730
01:54:39,900 --> 01:54:48,420
and have puzzle sluts blow shit up they're all on the wiki that that's out

2731
01:54:48,420 --> 01:54:53,100
there and and a lot of times inspired by you guys and somebody's update our wiki

2732
01:54:53,100 --> 01:54:56,860
to let you know them know that we've actually got a reality yes if somebody

2733
01:54:56,860 --> 01:55:02,780
has and what's now had a text-based game we did we it's not the first olr

2734
01:55:02,780 --> 01:55:06,420
inspired game but this is gonna be the first one that you it's on our dream

2735
01:55:06,420 --> 01:55:13,820
list you can play on a console that's gonna be awesome and it's so somebody

2736
01:55:13,820 --> 01:55:19,100
just need to put patent-pending yyr on that yeah he has programmed it and we

2737
01:55:19,100 --> 01:55:22,420
have said we will not sue him right we're not gonna sue him over that we

2738
01:55:22,420 --> 01:55:26,980
think it's great that he's uh he's running with it so awesome you know

2739
01:55:26,980 --> 01:55:31,500
since you're mentioning games and making stuff I thought it was kind of cool I

2740
01:55:31,500 --> 01:55:39,060
actually checked out there is this I happen there's a link or an article or

2741
01:55:39,060 --> 01:55:43,300
whatever they got it didn't make our show roll it's about a the new my low

2742
01:55:43,300 --> 01:55:47,260
ponies thing there's a fighting game that someone's making oh yeah I heard

2743
01:55:47,260 --> 01:55:53,220
about this okay okay well they're using a you know the old it's a fighter or 2d

2744
01:55:53,220 --> 01:55:57,340
fighter maker I guess is about the same people did RPG maker anyways in

2745
01:55:57,340 --> 01:56:02,620
searching for 2d fighter maker I came across of this engine it's called engine

2746
01:56:02,620 --> 01:56:07,060
zero zero one and it's actually something similar to that where you can

2747
01:56:07,060 --> 01:56:12,780
make your own games but the other thing that they're also adding is Android and

2748
01:56:12,780 --> 01:56:18,500
iOS support so you'll be able to publish your own games your own iPod games

2749
01:56:18,500 --> 01:56:25,100
without any programming knowledge Wow wouldn't that be fun oh boy Loki's eyes

2750
01:56:25,100 --> 01:56:32,020
are lighting up okay awesome all right well um we'll keep you guys posted on

2751
01:56:32,020 --> 01:56:38,420
that it's I just man I just this show going into its tenth year next year it's

2752
01:56:38,420 --> 01:56:42,100
like now we have we've won a podcast award you know even though some time ago

2753
01:56:42,100 --> 01:56:46,860
we've got nominated again we've had a PC game a text-based adventure written on

2754
01:56:46,860 --> 01:56:50,500
us and now we have like an actual like console graphical thing like a like a

2755
01:56:50,500 --> 01:56:53,360
more for lack of better term like legit thing you're gonna be able to buy on

2756
01:56:53,360 --> 01:56:57,900
your console that's inspired by our show it's just it's amazing like like it's

2757
01:56:57,900 --> 01:57:04,300
like the ultimate compliment for real for real so so excited well I don't know

2758
01:57:04,300 --> 01:57:07,640
how we follow this with more gaming news but that's what we're gonna do so Loki

2759
01:57:07,640 --> 01:57:14,460
good luck all right I will I'll try to make it significant so there's an

2760
01:57:14,460 --> 01:57:19,620
interesting patent that Microsoft is working or has right now that's points

2761
01:57:19,620 --> 01:57:23,820
to a possible connect based parental controls and what it's gonna do is it's

2762
01:57:23,820 --> 01:57:27,720
actually gonna look at your proportion tracking your body skeleton that kind of

2763
01:57:27,720 --> 01:57:34,460
stuff to figure out what age you were probably you know it's gonna take a best

2764
01:57:34,460 --> 01:57:43,460
guess I guess neat idea I guess but I see a ton of flaws with this one

2765
01:57:43,460 --> 01:57:49,260
couldn't a child simply unplug the Kinect and boom problem solved no need

2766
01:57:49,260 --> 01:57:53,100
for parental controls whatsoever and the only way this would really work is if

2767
01:57:53,100 --> 01:57:59,780
it's actually physically built into the console and then the other thing is what

2768
01:57:59,780 --> 01:58:07,100
about the short people or you know midgets if you will you know what about

2769
01:58:07,100 --> 01:58:13,620
them that's not good I don't know I just don't think anything's gonna happen with

2770
01:58:13,620 --> 01:58:20,700
this but it's a neat concept I guess but once again and once again it really it

2771
01:58:20,700 --> 01:58:24,940
comes down to our parents gonna set up these parental controls in the first

2772
01:58:24,940 --> 01:58:31,180
place that's true it's probably gonna be more complex to set up but this

2773
01:58:31,180 --> 01:58:34,820
discriminates against midgets because gonna scan a little person and it's

2774
01:58:34,820 --> 01:58:41,340
gonna think it's a child and say no porn for you that is said I mean this is one

2775
01:58:41,340 --> 01:58:44,700
of those things is like I guess it's an interesting idea but at the end of the

2776
01:58:44,700 --> 01:58:47,520
day it's also kind of dumb because you know what parental control you should

2777
01:58:47,520 --> 01:58:55,220
have in your house at all times apparent it is apparent isn't it yes it is very

2778
01:58:55,220 --> 01:59:02,140
apparent that you should have a parent ha unless you were me as a child moving

2779
01:59:02,140 --> 01:59:07,140
on I want to move on I don't have to move on why do we always have to know

2780
01:59:07,140 --> 01:59:11,700
I've gotten fine how about minecraft shit just gonna stop how's that sound

2781
01:59:11,700 --> 01:59:16,140
we'll just stop no we're not ready for minecraft shit are we yes no we're not

2782
01:59:16,140 --> 01:59:21,820
we haven't done mailbag yet oh damn look at you look at you trying to cheat try

2783
01:59:21,820 --> 01:59:27,900
to reminder did you see the ad for the show where every gamer has a boy yeah

2784
01:59:27,900 --> 01:59:36,340
well well a voice there's no voices in a mailbag it's text all right yeah leave a

2785
01:59:36,340 --> 01:59:41,140
message I want a voice I think this is a little bit like too late I think but I

2786
01:59:41,140 --> 01:59:44,300
don't know I want to share this anyway but okay you guys heard about the whole

2787
01:59:44,300 --> 01:59:51,180
thing where Sony and EA they updated their terms of service so that you can't

2788
01:59:51,180 --> 01:59:53,980
take them to a class-action lawsuit anymore and the only way you could get

2789
01:59:53,980 --> 01:59:59,300
out of the class-action lawsuit was to send a letter well there's a website

2790
01:59:59,300 --> 02:00:03,380
that was created called gamers opt out which was basically a site that you

2791
02:00:03,380 --> 02:00:07,620
could fill in information online and they would send it in for you

2792
02:00:07,620 --> 02:00:15,020
interesting so hmm and I guess there was some concern at first that a legal

2793
02:00:15,020 --> 02:00:19,180
person had registered this website but turned out after some investigation it's

2794
02:00:19,180 --> 02:00:22,780
not at some some dude up in Michigan who's just really mad about this like a

2795
02:00:22,780 --> 02:00:26,160
lot of people are really and it's a pretty interesting concept the only

2796
02:00:26,160 --> 02:00:30,980
bummer is that Sony term of service thing happened already like six weeks

2797
02:00:30,980 --> 02:00:37,540
ago at this point wasn't it hold on yes it happened but that is only if you've

2798
02:00:37,540 --> 02:00:41,820
agreed to it and you can only agree to it if you've updated your system if you

2799
02:00:41,820 --> 02:00:45,500
haven't updated your system you haven't made any sort of agreement yet I would

2800
02:00:45,500 --> 02:00:48,860
just assume that most people have done that by now but I guess if you haven't

2801
02:00:48,860 --> 02:00:52,460
for whatever reason then you could still use this like I haven't because I

2802
02:00:52,460 --> 02:00:59,420
haven't played a PlayStation 3 online for ever so I think it's a neat concept

2803
02:00:59,420 --> 02:01:03,900
you know and I hey if somebody's gonna do the work for me I'm all for it but at

2804
02:01:03,900 --> 02:01:08,980
the end of the day you know why does Sony get to set all the rules in regards

2805
02:01:08,980 --> 02:01:11,820
to what you can and can't do legally like yes I know there's a Supreme Court

2806
02:01:11,820 --> 02:01:16,300
precedent and all that stuff but I don't know it just kind of seems wrong but at

2807
02:01:16,300 --> 02:01:20,580
the same time what do class-action lawsuits really accomplish either like

2808
02:01:20,580 --> 02:01:24,780
everybody gets a coupon or everybody gets like 50 cents you know usually

2809
02:01:24,780 --> 02:01:29,420
class-action lawsuits don't end with with much of anything so that's why I'm

2810
02:01:29,420 --> 02:01:34,620
not as mad about it but it does kind of it's more of a principle it's more the

2811
02:01:34,620 --> 02:01:39,260
principle I think at the end of the day yeah and when you know really how often

2812
02:01:39,260 --> 02:01:46,260
do you know do you or I actually file a lawsuit against a company I mean right

2813
02:01:46,260 --> 02:01:51,180
never right well sometimes you jump in on class-action lawsuits though yeah but

2814
02:01:51,180 --> 02:01:53,860
that's because you don't really have to do anything yeah what's the worst it's

2815
02:01:53,860 --> 02:01:56,940
gonna happen I'm not gonna lose any money so might as well you know see if I

2816
02:01:56,940 --> 02:02:00,340
get something but I think that's really the only reason people jump in on this

2817
02:02:00,340 --> 02:02:05,300
stuff but I mean I would think if Sony did something to piss me off and let's

2818
02:02:05,300 --> 02:02:10,020
say they just you know sold my house underneath me and you know took all my

2819
02:02:10,020 --> 02:02:14,260
assets or something like that for some sort of weird claws or something that

2820
02:02:14,260 --> 02:02:19,060
they had I can't see myself really suing them I'd just be like well I'm just not

2821
02:02:19,060 --> 02:02:26,500
gonna buy your next console or game or whatever you know that you have all

2822
02:02:26,500 --> 02:02:30,540

anyone shut up that's just like you know your challenge radio gods I just wanted

2834
02:03:46,420 --> 02:03:49,620
to chime in on the Final Fantasy 10 remake discussion from last week's show

2835
02:03:49,620 --> 02:03:54,140
personally I'm excited extremely excited about this Final Fantasy 10 is my

2836
02:03:54,140 --> 02:03:59,700
favorite RPG ever not only is the battle system fun and has really awesome

2837
02:03:59,700 --> 02:04:04,420
awesome summons that are actually useful unlike Final Fantasy 13 but the game has

2838
02:04:04,420 --> 02:04:08,540
an emotional musical score and a storyline with compelling character cast

2839
02:04:08,540 --> 02:04:14,460
I don't understand why people complain about the voice of Titus or even the

2840
02:04:14,460 --> 02:04:17,820
character itself for one thing I love hearing his narrations and thoughts on

2841
02:04:17,820 --> 02:04:21,580
how you go through the story which reminds me of kiln and the melancholy of

2842
02:04:21,580 --> 02:04:27,100
Haruhi Suzumiya kind of and for people who have a problem with the character

2843
02:04:27,100 --> 02:04:30,300
itself he's just being realistic people he asks a lot of questions and gets

2844
02:04:30,300 --> 02:04:33,780
emotionally stressed because one he's in a world unknown to him and to the other

2845
02:04:33,780 --> 02:04:37,780
characters do keep a lot from him until later in the story and when something as

2846
02:04:37,780 --> 02:04:42,340
important as a loved one self-sacrifice it can take quite a toll on someone give

2847
02:04:42,340 --> 02:04:45,780
squirts off to break for having a character we can somewhat relate to geez

2848
02:04:45,780 --> 02:04:49,900
and this one's directed to me and Jamie I completely agree with you on Final

2849
02:04:49,900 --> 02:04:54,700
Fantasy 10 to the game is just loads of fun and the gestures make it really

2850
02:04:54,700 --> 02:04:58,220
interesting in all honesty if you were a person who loved Final Fantasy tactics

2851
02:04:58,220 --> 02:05:02,780
with the different classes and Final Fantasy 7 active time battle system then

2852
02:05:02,780 --> 02:05:06,180
there is no reason you shouldn't have fun with this game unless you hate

2853
02:05:06,180 --> 02:05:09,460
Charlie's Angels with all of your being also a thousand words is one of my

2854
02:05:09,460 --> 02:05:15,140
favorite Final Fantasy songs one more note about on the Final Fantasy 10 vs.

2855
02:05:15,140 --> 02:05:18,900
7 remake argument that people keep on having let's look at it this way Final

2856
02:05:18,900 --> 02:05:23,600
Fantasy 7 got a prequel a cell phone game a shooter an anime a movie and a

2857
02:05:23,600 --> 02:05:27,940
special edition of the movie with more scenes Final Fantasy 10 got a sequel and

2858
02:05:27,940 --> 02:05:32,420
that's it let's spread the love around people thanks for reading Oscar ps Rob

2859
02:05:32,420 --> 02:05:37,340
did you ever finish Final Fantasy 13 no I'm like in the last chapter and I never

2860
02:05:37,340 --> 02:05:41,660
finished it cuz I suck but I keep thinking about doing that too I really

2861
02:05:41,660 --> 02:05:45,260
want to play 13 too so I think I need to finish but at least I know I have until

2862
02:05:45,260 --> 02:05:48,940
what like January or February hey you want to hear something funny since I'm

2863
02:05:48,940 --> 02:05:54,980
gonna be real the show right now sure um I'm gonna read a book what yeah you're

2864
02:05:54,980 --> 02:06:03,700
like me we know you can read that was my middle finger going up Wow so in the

2865
02:06:03,700 --> 02:06:07,060
last five minutes dark soccer's finger went up Loki's finger went up now

2866
02:06:07,060 --> 02:06:11,100
everybody in chat room guess when's my finger gonna go up right now no it's uh

2867
02:06:11,100 --> 02:06:16,340
it's something completely appropriate ready player one it's basically kind of

2868
02:06:16,340 --> 02:06:22,980
the way I've I think the story is like is it's very much like Charlie and the

2869
02:06:22,980 --> 02:06:27,700
Chocolate Factory meets a bunch of 80s references and a bunch of sci-fi video

2870
02:06:27,700 --> 02:06:32,740
game references basically this guy has this kind of think of it like Second

2871
02:06:32,740 --> 02:06:39,260
Life this giant universe cyberspace that people go to and he's gonna die but he's

2872
02:06:39,260 --> 02:06:44,460
leaving it for the person that finds this key in the thing and so this kid

2873
02:06:44,460 --> 02:06:48,340
from the ghetto or whatever builds this computer and ends up trying to go in

2874
02:06:48,340 --> 02:06:51,700
there to find the key so it's very much like you know Charlie Chocolate Factory

2875
02:06:51,700 --> 02:06:56,860
but there's you know references to all things like sci-fi and video games and

2876
02:06:56,860 --> 02:07:01,380
stuff like you know they've got the the owl ship from Watchmen in there the

2877
02:07:01,380 --> 02:07:07,020
DeLorean movie out of this like the movie oh they are okay but it's just

2878
02:07:07,020 --> 02:07:14,380
really it sounds cool and that's like part of the plot for spiral yeah my wife

2879
02:07:14,380 --> 02:07:18,700
was very surprised that I would read a book and I don't read but I don't read

2880
02:07:18,700 --> 02:07:22,820
books very often I used to I used to read sci-fi books and like you're like

2881
02:07:22,820 --> 02:07:26,020
me I I used to read books all the time when I was growing up like I used to

2882
02:07:26,020 --> 02:07:30,100
love the scary books like that was what was his name Christopher Pike goosebumps

2883
02:07:30,100 --> 02:07:34,180
is that the guy no it was different well maybe Arl Stein yeah I was a Pike Pike

2884
02:07:34,180 --> 02:07:38,260
the name Arl Stein and yeah his books I used to read a lot of those and I read I

2885
02:07:38,260 --> 02:07:41,260
read some other stuff too you should see the book that I finished in two days

2886
02:07:41,260 --> 02:07:44,540
actually I liked a lot of even though I hear he was a total asshole I liked a

2887
02:07:44,540 --> 02:07:47,620
lot of the rolled all stuff like Charlie Chocolate Factory in glass elevator and

2888
02:07:47,620 --> 02:07:51,420
and James the giant peach and the boy I think the boy who ruled the world

2889
02:07:51,420 --> 02:07:54,580
something like that well maybe if it's good I will loan you the book afterwards

2890
02:07:54,580 --> 02:07:57,820
after my wife reads it cuz she's supposed to read it well hopefully

2891
02:07:57,820 --> 02:08:01,900
somebody will buy me an iPad so I can play with gadgets when I read books it's

2892
02:08:01,900 --> 02:08:04,740
not that I by the way it's not that I'm like reading sucks it's just that the

2893
02:08:04,740 --> 02:08:09,880
internet has kind of like like instead of reading I pull up Wikipedia on my

2894
02:08:09,880 --> 02:08:12,780
phone and I'm just looking at Wikipedia articles like that's kind of what it's

2895
02:08:12,780 --> 02:08:16,100
turned into like my reading is now what attention span theater see the stuff

2896
02:08:16,100 --> 02:08:22,000
that I've actually started reading it again lately is reading anthropology

2897
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:27,740
studies I'm not I've never been a fan of historical fiction so I put down one

2898
02:08:27,740 --> 02:08:34,820
historical fiction I was reading but I like I've been reading cultural books

2899
02:08:34,820 --> 02:08:39,100
and the book I just finished was geisha by Liza Dalby she actually worked as a

2900
02:08:39,100 --> 02:08:44,180
geisha in the 70s it's her doctoral thesis so that's what I've been reading

2901
02:08:44,180 --> 02:08:47,220
lately it's not that I hate reading I just have a really short attention span

2902
02:08:47,220 --> 02:08:51,100
but apparently it's good it is it is actually on the iOS bookstore whatever

2903
02:08:51,100 --> 02:08:55,580
it's actually in what it's on the New York Times bestsellers list right now

2904
02:08:55,580 --> 02:09:01,740
so okay if you like I mean that Kotaku actually was the one that kind of turned

2905
02:09:01,740 --> 02:09:06,940
me on to that they ran an article about the book and with some screen it wasn't

2906
02:09:06,940 --> 02:09:10,220
it was concept art I think for a screenplay because he's wrote a

2907
02:09:10,220 --> 02:09:14,700
screenplay for it as well that will probably become a movie but well and I

2908
02:09:14,700 --> 02:09:17,420
was wrong it's not that it sounds like spiral is that it sounds like the third

2909
02:09:17,420 --> 02:09:23,060
book loop in the virus the ring the ring spiral and loop it sounds kind of like

2910
02:09:23,060 --> 02:09:27,260
loop yeah but with video game references yeah all right let's get back to the

2911
02:09:27,260 --> 02:09:32,900
emails here we go okay um the first one's from Holly we got two from Holly

2912
02:09:32,900 --> 02:09:37,020
but they're short so Molly says you were forgiven PS I ate your Xbox connector

2913
02:09:37,020 --> 02:09:41,380
cables what is that uh it was because Loki was talking about the dog but that

2914
02:09:41,380 --> 02:09:44,820
was like a month ago remember Loki yeah I think about the dog's gonna die soon

2915
02:09:44,820 --> 02:09:49,740
she sent us a picture terrible she sent us a picture of her dog oh I see the

2916
02:09:49,740 --> 02:09:54,020
dog so come on I didn't say the dog would die soon and I hope it doesn't I'm

2917

02:10:38,200 --> 02:10:41,140
the next email I know this is like my fourth email this week but I'm just

2925
02:10:41,140 --> 02:10:44,060
passing this on for your new segment this is a really clever way to get

2926
02:10:44,060 --> 02:10:48,460
people to resub even though I had let my sub lapse because I'm playing Guild Wars

2927
02:10:48,460 --> 02:10:51,900
right now I hopped right on this and reset when I saw it basically it's rift

2928
02:10:51,900 --> 02:10:56,340
offering replies for the long replies rewards for the longer that you say

2929
02:10:56,340 --> 02:11:02,900
subscribe in the form of gear Oh interesting so like here and not like

2930
02:11:02,900 --> 02:11:09,220
pets and things that's interesting so like six months sanctuaries guard which

2931
02:11:09,220 --> 02:11:15,140
is a helm you get a personal vendor which we've got one of those in our

2932
02:11:15,140 --> 02:11:24,900
guild you get like some swords for 18 months you get gauntlets and greaves and

2933
02:11:24,900 --> 02:11:30,020
tricorn of the drowned I'm gonna absolutely know whatever I mean is you

2934
02:11:30,020 --> 02:11:35,060
and you get something called the endless skull helm that's just a cool name so

2935
02:11:35,060 --> 02:11:40,460

moving on well hold on hold on guys say everybody wow does something kind of

2937
02:11:44,620 --> 02:11:47,900
similar with the whole like anniversary gifts I mean but they're not like just

2938
02:11:47,900 --> 02:11:52,380
for longtime subscribers I don't know I gotta talk about MMOs real quick though

2939
02:11:52,380 --> 02:11:55,300
because and I'm just gonna totally publicly talk about a private

2940
02:11:55,300 --> 02:11:59,260
conversation I don't even care me Glatov do you know what game he got for free

2941
02:11:59,260 --> 02:12:05,700
from some little manager thing or whatever yeah Final Fantasy 14 what so

2942
02:12:05,700 --> 02:12:09,060
he got it for free and he's been playing it remember how fun has he 14 like we

2943
02:12:09,060 --> 02:12:13,020
all played it and during the beta we're like this game is shit but they I didn't

2944
02:12:13,020 --> 02:12:17,980
they've tweaked a lot of stuff and he's telling me like it's more like 11 now

2945
02:12:17,980 --> 02:12:26,300
but it's actually really pretty he's like you should play and I'm like but

2946
02:12:26,300 --> 02:12:29,100
this is Shane we're talking about and he's really good at making people do

2947
02:12:29,100 --> 02:12:32,860
things they don't want to do so I don't know maybe I will have to try it well

2948
02:12:32,860 --> 02:12:37,220
hold on I'm just curious because you know it's kind of sucked and I'm

2949
02:12:37,220 --> 02:12:41,900
wondering how much it's going for you know $25 on Amazon if I'm not mistaken

2950
02:12:41,900 --> 02:12:48,700
and there's no monthly fee right now hmm really Oh Loki that Loki just went I

2951

2955
02:13:18,260 --> 02:13:21,860

really light this week not really the latest top 20 list from some of those

2957

2958
02:13:28,940 --> 02:13:33,380
for it yes I'm jealous the headlines are focusing on the top three but I was

2959
02:13:33,380 --> 02:13:37,580
interested by the PlayStation being placed at 13 and intended reaching 16

2960
02:13:37,580 --> 02:13:41,900
with the Xbox not featuring is the Xbox really not cool apparently we don't

2961
02:13:41,900 --> 02:13:47,980

02:15:10,500 --> 02:15:16,460
would be epic all right let's move on yeah we got more emails okay a very

2977
02:15:16,460 --> 02:15:22,980
feminine James Bond okay this comes from zither who zither is actually my new

2978
02:15:22,980 --> 02:15:28,740
buddy now for introducing me to a different PC engine thingy so I listened

2979
02:15:28,740 --> 02:15:32,380
to episode 428 recently and near the end dark soccer was talking about the PC

2980
02:15:32,380 --> 02:15:36,820
engine and turbo graphics 16 emulation and mentioned magic engine I used to use

2981
02:15:36,820 --> 02:15:40,180
magic engine to emulate but later I came across an emulator that's a lot better

2982
02:15:40,180 --> 02:15:45,660
it's called Oh Taki oh it's oh oh ta ke and it was developed by Japanese guy

2983
02:15:45,660 --> 02:15:48,780
from what I remember hearing magic engine has some input lag which is a

2984
02:15:48,780 --> 02:15:53,620
common hindrance in emulators and Oh Taki Oh Taki has practically none at all

2985
02:15:53,620 --> 02:15:56,860
plus it's free as opposed to magic engine where you have to pay I'd say

2986
02:15:56,860 --> 02:16:01,180
it's very worthwhile emulator for the sole reason that it's free also I am

2987
02:16:01,180 --> 02:16:05,300
with dark Sakura and hoping that planet Harriers can get emulated just recently

2988
02:16:05,300 --> 02:16:09,460
someone managed to get Sega's model 3 hardware almost emulated and I hope that

2989
02:16:09,460 --> 02:16:12,500
another James can crack the Hikaru and emulate it too you were gonna say

2990
02:16:12,500 --> 02:16:19,740
something no I'm sorry I'm just Mouse being retarded no keep being one of the

3031
02:19:34,020 --> 02:19:38,460
just murdering after Dead Island um who do I talk to you about purchasing the

3032
02:19:38,460 --> 02:19:44,100
DTR freak domain name it would feel like I would be owning a piece of the past a

3033
02:19:44,100 --> 02:19:47,140
relic from a different time when I was younger anyways at this point all of our

3034
02:19:47,140 --> 02:19:51,300
posts on the form will be lost in time like tears in rain for the record

3035
02:19:51,300 --> 02:19:58,940
probably not because I'm sure Jason still has the the forum logs that would

3036
02:19:58,940 --> 02:20:03,340
be terrible to like troll it and just put like coming back soon and then just

3037
02:20:03,340 --> 02:20:07,820
never ever I don't ever I don't I don't see it being let go of honestly I don't

3038
02:20:07,820 --> 02:20:11,220
see being let go of either but let it be known if they if they are you've got

3039
02:20:11,220 --> 02:20:14,900
competition because if they do put that domain up for sale I want it and I will

3040
02:20:14,900 --> 02:20:19,100
I will put it put it to a legitimate purpose and will not sell it spam

3041
02:20:19,100 --> 02:20:26,540
whatever I I want it absolutely but I have a dog I know other people want it

3042
02:20:26,540 --> 02:20:32,140
too so I'm not holding my breath but if I could get it I would take it so moving

3043
02:20:32,140 --> 02:20:36,980
forward I mentioned this a year ago when a backlog turned into 30-plus titles is

3044
02:20:36,980 --> 02:20:42,420
it no longer a gaming backlog but a back jam and he shows us a picture of his

3045
02:20:42,420 --> 02:20:50,340
plates and says DDR player that's great and my the plates on my car is still

3046
02:20:50,340 --> 02:20:56,900
says DDR plyr but on my newer car 2010 Mazda mx-5 Miata shout out to all of our

3047
02:20:56,900 --> 02:21:02,900
peace and triple-a I hope you have triple-a if you've got a Miata shit get

3048
02:21:02,900 --> 02:21:10,660
some triple-a so yeah all right was that it for emails yes well if you want to

3049
02:21:10,660 --> 02:21:15,100
make Jamie work mailbag at orange lounge radio.com send us more email I will cut

3050
02:21:15,100 --> 02:21:19,740
a bitch if you yes we are reading emails again all right let's move on

3051
02:21:19,740 --> 02:21:26,580
Loki okay look he's already trying to see if the domains available I know I

3052
02:21:26,580 --> 02:21:31,260
know it's not somebody would have snatched up by now if it was there it is

3053
02:21:31,260 --> 02:21:40,340
that's right anyways so let's talk a little bit about Sony and you know they

3054
02:21:40,340 --> 02:21:46,740
have the phone brand Ericsson well they actually may be buying out Ericsson it's

3055
02:21:46,740 --> 02:21:49,980
interesting this is coming from the Wall Street Journal and apparently they're

3056
02:21:49,980 --> 02:21:53,460
gonna be buying out Ericsson the mobile phone company I guess they teamed up

3057
02:21:53,460 --> 02:21:58,220
with back in 2001 and of course they just recently released the Xperia play

3058
02:21:58,220 --> 02:22:06,300
through the Ericsson line and of course they're gonna have you know the new

3059
02:22:06,300 --> 02:22:11,060
PlayStation Vita and the phone stuff and they're gonna have you know the store to

3060
02:22:11,060 --> 02:22:15,820
go along with that well it's interesting because if Sony Ericsson you know

3061
02:22:15,820 --> 02:22:22,460
becomes just Sony mobile then basically the first thing they would do is you

3062
02:22:22,460 --> 02:22:27,380
have a PlayStation phone that's actually a PlayStation phone instead of just this

3063
02:22:27,380 --> 02:22:32,220
experience player some roundabout weird name like that which people still dub it

3064
02:22:32,220 --> 02:22:36,300
the PlayStation phone but if Sony actually has their own true phone company

3065
02:22:36,300 --> 02:22:42,380
then our phone you know hardware manufacturer that'd be kind of neat

3066
02:22:42,380 --> 02:22:47,820
they'd be joining up I guess against you know Apple even taking them on you know

3067
02:22:47,820 --> 02:22:57,500
headfirst be interesting I don't know has it worked for the computers because

3068
02:22:57,500 --> 02:23:04,780
they're damn fucking expensive yeah for real but apples are very expensive as

3069
02:23:04,780 --> 02:23:12,540
well people buy those that's true this is about just having that status well

3070
02:23:12,540 --> 02:23:16,220
there's a lot of games looking to be getting that same status as well you

3071
02:23:16,220 --> 02:23:18,740
know you kind of heard why we are talk about a little bit when he was on the

3072
02:23:18,740 --> 02:23:21,260
phone earlier is it sometimes it's kind of hard to get noticed and get coverage

3073
02:23:21,260 --> 02:23:25,180
on a lot of the big sites well Activision is trying to help some indie

3074
02:23:25,180 --> 02:23:29,340
games get exposure there's an indie games competition that they did before

3075
02:23:29,340 --> 02:23:33,420
and I guess what happened is that the publisher is going to be doing this

3076
02:23:33,420 --> 02:23:39,300
again offering two hundred and fifty thousand dollars to two indie developers

3077
02:23:39,300 --> 02:23:43,620
ownership of submission rights will remain with the creator they're very

3078
02:23:43,620 --> 02:23:48,220
important to put that in the press release and yeah there you go

3079
02:23:48,220 --> 02:23:52,780
Activision is working with IndieCade to actually do the contest and it'll be

3080
02:23:52,780 --> 02:23:58,940
open for submissions from now through December 31st that's awesome

3081
02:23:58,940 --> 02:24:04,980
hopefully can oh maybe yyr should submit bungee ferret tossing as you know the

3082
02:24:04,980 --> 02:24:13,180
future of gaming all right anyhow dark soccer what do you got for us well as I

3083
02:24:13,180 --> 02:24:18,100
brought up earlier when I was trying to skip doing of a mailbag

3084
02:24:18,100 --> 02:24:24,260
Minecraft has something new in it there have been screenshots released from work

3085
02:24:24,260 --> 02:24:35,420
in progress version that has dragons dragons so it's either supposed to go in

3086
02:24:35,420 --> 02:24:42,420
there or maybe not ever but the creator has been tweeting that texturing the

3087
02:24:42,420 --> 02:24:49,100
dragon was interesting so it looks kind of blocky like everything in Minecraft

3088
02:24:49,100 --> 02:24:57,780
does yeah dragons that's it all right it would be needs I guess I mean he keeps

3089
02:24:57,780 --> 02:25:02,740
adding more and more things to kill you in the game so I kind of probably would

3090
02:25:02,740 --> 02:25:11,940
impede on building stuff I would think the constant death my guess at least so

3091
02:25:11,940 --> 02:25:15,140
this is also cool since we were talking a little bit about indie games and stuff

3092
02:25:15,140 --> 02:25:20,340
on live is actually putting on some new indie games this fall and some of these

3093
02:25:20,340 --> 02:25:24,820
actually might recognize because they've been hitting different console platforms

3094
02:25:24,820 --> 02:25:29,620
as well as PC including orcs must die which was just released on Xbox Live

3095
02:25:29,620 --> 02:25:39,380
Arcade limbo magica bastion space chem and Avadon the Black Fortress and those

3096
02:25:39,380 --> 02:25:44,580
are on being added to already existing indie games that are on there including

3097
02:25:44,580 --> 02:25:49,820
braid trying world of goo and the mall so that's kind of cool that there will

3098
02:25:49,820 --> 02:25:57,580
be kind of a showcase of all sorts of games not just you know streaming games

3099
02:25:57,980 --> 02:26:01,660
awesome it's good that on live is actually getting more games because

3100
02:26:01,660 --> 02:26:05,020
that's kind of where they're hurting right now you know what I mean yeah so

3101
02:26:05,020 --> 02:26:08,340
it's always a good thing just a couple more stories for you guys then we're

3102
02:26:08,340 --> 02:26:12,020
going to go to the Twitter with twitter.com slash olr I haven't seen hardly

3103
02:26:12,020 --> 02:26:16,180
anything show up on there so maybe after I say that it will or also there's going

3104
02:26:16,180 --> 02:26:22,260
to be the skype line of course one eight seven seven game olr in just a moment I

3105
02:26:22,260 --> 02:26:30,900
guess this is interesting I a study was done by website bundle who tracks credit

3106
02:26:30,900 --> 02:26:34,620
card spending nice I'm sure that works but I guess they track all the

3107
02:26:34,620 --> 02:26:40,020
transactions or whatever and what the study did is that it looked at it looked

3108
02:26:40,020 --> 02:26:45,300
at games from EB and steam and GameStop and all these sales from July 2010 to

3109
02:26:45,300 --> 02:26:50,740
June 2011 and looked at the top 100 cities in the US by population the city

3110
02:26:50,740 --> 02:26:56,780
that bought the most games Huntington New York kind of random right yeah I

3111
02:26:56,780 --> 02:27:01,860
mean that's I'm assuming that's upstate certainly not you know the big city but

3112
02:27:01,860 --> 02:27:10,100
also in the list here locally at number five Modesto a laugh because like

3113
02:27:10,100 --> 02:27:15,660
Modesto's like it's halfway between here and Fresno like what else can I say

3114
02:27:15,660 --> 02:27:21,780
about Modesto was also on this you know what else was on the list Stockton was

3115
02:27:21,780 --> 02:27:26,100
stocked on list of Fresno's it not like they have much to do there Sacramento's

3116
02:27:26,100 --> 02:27:30,060
not even on the list a lot of these strike me as like suburb II things well

3117
02:27:30,060 --> 02:27:33,780
then again Pittsburgh's like number six so there are Chesapeake Virginia's

3118
02:27:33,780 --> 02:27:39,500
number four so there are some bigger cities that are on there I don't know

3119
02:27:39,500 --> 02:27:43,180
interesting Denver Virginia beaches at ten those are aren't they like right

3120
02:27:43,180 --> 02:27:47,580
near each other Miami think they are so there you go that's your list of game

3121
02:27:47,580 --> 02:27:52,940
oh yeah Stockton number 41 hello Stockton so I guess those are the big

3122
02:27:52,940 --> 02:27:56,700
cities that buy video games probably cuz there's nothing else to do and Rama says

3123
02:27:56,700 --> 02:27:59,820
Huntington is Long Island thank you sorry we're California kids we don't

3124
02:27:59,820 --> 02:28:05,460
know our East Coast geography as well Huntington is Long Island hmm all right

3125
02:28:05,460 --> 02:28:09,100
one more one more story I threw this in here at the last minute because it's

3126
02:28:09,100 --> 02:28:13,500
it's related to to music games and DDR which by the way I did a little research

3127
02:28:13,500 --> 02:28:18,660
on the DDR freak domain it's registered through July 2017 so we won't be getting

3128
02:28:18,660 --> 02:28:23,340
that anytime soon that's not surprising at all though I mean that site probably

3129
02:28:23,340 --> 02:28:26,300
still generates quite a bit of traffic even though it's not there did it ever

3130
02:28:26,300 --> 02:28:31,220
like come back up no or did the server get I know the servers are like getting

3131
02:28:31,220 --> 02:28:35,380
unplugged or whatever yeah it's it's not back up it's still just the demo just

3132
02:28:35,380 --> 02:28:42,420
goes to go daddy Wow and if you you know click on the the register it thing then

3133
02:28:42,420 --> 02:28:48,220
it has you go to one of those buy out a used domain theme was it expiring anyway

3134
02:28:48,220 --> 02:29:01,460
no I don't think so interesting we'll have to figure out what's going on huh

3135
02:29:01,460 --> 02:29:07,020
all right well anyway this story is about a movie that's happening it's a

3136
02:29:07,020 --> 02:29:12,140
3d movie and it's supposed to feature scenes from pump it up or whatever it's

3137
02:29:12,140 --> 02:29:16,860
targeted at tweens and teens and it's supposed to be about dancing game and a

3138
02:29:16,860 --> 02:29:21,500
girl who's bullied by her peers over I guess the lack of skills of the game

3139
02:29:21,500 --> 02:29:25,980
it's gonna have its premiere at the end of October in Burbank California but

3140
02:29:25,980 --> 02:29:30,620
like seriously look at this just look at this you guys based on true events

3141
02:29:30,620 --> 02:29:33,940
you see what she's wearing right now I look so much better than her it's not

3142
02:29:33,940 --> 02:30:02,940
even competition it's nothing personal super jets DX

3143
02:30:04,740 --> 02:30:09,580
this whole thing looks like it was shot in front of a green screen

3144
02:30:10,780 --> 02:30:14,220
you know what that looks like to me to be real like this is the arc music

3145
02:30:14,220 --> 02:30:19,300
factory equivalent of movies is what this is and you just say enjoy your rep

3146
02:30:19,300 --> 02:30:22,780
Rebecca black music on your way to watch this premiere if you go like I don't

3147
02:30:22,780 --> 02:30:31,020
care that it's about a dance game it's only just kind of sad that's all so um

3148
02:30:31,020 --> 02:30:40,900
yeah Alex terrible sure does all right well is it a world premiere if no one

3149
02:30:40,900 --> 02:30:49,140
goes to see it it's a neighborhood premiere it's a street premiere all

3150
02:30:49,140 --> 02:30:55,900

3160
02:31:40,540 --> 02:31:44,500
freak have you heard about this reunion tournament thing they're doing I hope we

3161
02:31:44,500 --> 02:31:49,060
can show support for him somehow uh good question I had heard there was supposed

3162
02:31:49,060 --> 02:31:53,740
to be an event on 20 November is that even a weekend that this is happening

3163
02:31:53,740 --> 02:31:59,900
20 November Thursday so it would have to be like 20 oh no I'm looking at 20

3164
02:31:59,900 --> 02:32:04,820
November is a Sunday I'm all for it if they do a meet up on 20 November but no

3165
02:32:04,820 --> 02:32:08,780
I haven't heard anything since the original Facebook poll so we need to

3166
02:32:08,780 --> 02:32:12,460
look at Facebook and follow up on that I don't know but we'll find out that's a

3167
02:32:12,460 --> 02:32:15,580
good question meanwhile let's go to the phones hire on

3168
02:32:15,580 --> 02:32:20,920
orange launch radio who's this some Shane what's up Shane I didn't know what

3169
02:32:20,920 --> 02:32:25,160
name I was gonna use so I changed it midway so sometimes sometimes we call

3170
02:32:25,160 --> 02:32:31,980
you meekly top and now you're Shane Shane nothing I'm just enjoying Final

3171
02:32:31,980 --> 02:32:35,820
Fantasy 14 right now did you hear did you hear us talking about that earlier

3172
02:32:35,820 --> 02:32:40,020
no because your feed sucks tonight I it's not us I don't know what's going on

3173
02:32:40,020 --> 02:32:44,100
we're trying all games I know but I'm still going but all games you know what

3174
02:32:44,100 --> 02:32:46,980
they give it to us for free so if they have an off night I can't get to well

3175
02:32:46,980 --> 02:32:57,380
you can get AIDS for free to use it Shane now that is a quote it does have a

3176
02:32:57,380 --> 02:33:04,980
point you can get yours for free comparing yours with a pretty accurate I

3177
02:33:04,980 --> 02:33:08,980
like yet you can probably get like Mexican labors for free you don't want

3178
02:33:08,980 --> 02:33:15,420
them either Final Fantasy 14 you can pay 25 bucks for and yet now you say this is

3179
02:33:15,420 --> 02:33:18,580
worth it I think you can actually get a little cheaper than that but yeah all

3180
02:33:18,580 --> 02:33:22,220
right so fine you can get it on eBay or whatever but now you have come around on

3181
02:33:22,220 --> 02:33:26,340
Final Fantasy 14 and you say Final Fantasy 14 is worth it yes it only took

3182
02:33:26,340 --> 02:33:31,060
a year of them completely overhauling the game for it to be playable alright

3183
02:33:31,060 --> 02:33:36,140
so how is this game gone from bad to good in your opinion well I mean it's

3184
02:33:36,140 --> 02:33:42,740
turned into what it looked like from the get-go a Final Fantasy 11 clone and we

3185
02:33:42,740 --> 02:33:49,460
played that for years and years and it it's fun I am enjoying my time I like it

3186
02:33:49,460 --> 02:33:54,060
because it's got like a real story you get invested in and I keep deleting my

3187
02:33:54,060 --> 02:33:58,060
characters and starting them over playing the intro areas because one of

3188
02:33:58,060 --> 02:34:02,260
them is like so depressing at the end because this little girl has her father

3189
02:34:02,260 --> 02:34:07,660
killed by one of these big ugly I forget what they're called like gob use or

3190
02:34:07,660 --> 02:34:12,940
something from Final Fantasy 11 but because 14 had to take everything from

3191
02:34:12,940 --> 02:34:15,860
11 and just change the name and that's how they were making it new and

3192
02:34:15,860 --> 02:34:21,140
exciting right yep and they updated the graphics so it's pretty like I like

3193
02:34:21,140 --> 02:34:24,100
making my character over and over again too because I can't decide on the hair

3194
02:34:24,100 --> 02:34:28,800
color what's wrong with blue I thought you did blue everything nope nope they

3195
02:34:28,800 --> 02:34:32,380
don't have a good color of blue so I went with brown but there's like eight

3196
02:34:32,380 --> 02:34:37,140
different shades of brown so I keep starting and like oh this is good for

3197
02:34:37,140 --> 02:34:44,700
five minutes but I need a different brown color so the game is fun huh yes

3198
02:34:44,700 --> 02:34:48,280
that means they're gonna start charging for it soon probably not because I

3199
02:34:48,280 --> 02:34:52,660
remember reading a quote saying that they would not start charging until the

3200
02:34:52,660 --> 02:34:58,020
game was at the point that they wanted it to be at and recently with this new

3201
02:34:58,020 --> 02:35:02,180
patch that came out this week they said that they feel the game is only halfway

3202
02:35:02,180 --> 02:35:07,300
to that goal of being you know where they would want it to be as a playable

3203
02:35:07,300 --> 02:35:12,820
game and that took a year so I'm hoping for another year free not paying for it

3204
02:35:12,820 --> 02:35:17,980
every month and if it keeps up like that I'll continue to play and maybe if I get

3205
02:35:17,980 --> 02:35:23,140
past level five and they got rid of the physical level so it's only one level

3206
02:35:23,140 --> 02:35:28,300
your class level no longer like class for physical six or something stupid

3207
02:35:28,300 --> 02:35:33,180
like that so maybe if I get past level five and I'll like it even more and I

3208
02:35:33,180 --> 02:35:36,780
want to keep playing it cuz I mean it is technically one of the cheaper MMOs to

3209
02:35:36,780 --> 02:35:43,900
play monthly it's only like 12 I guess but that mean what Wow's 15 most are

3210
02:35:43,900 --> 02:35:47,000
priced in that area right how much is the Star Wars that memo gonna be do we

3211
02:35:47,000 --> 02:35:50,740
know yet 15 they said per month unless you do like the same thing well does

3212
02:35:50,740 --> 02:35:54,140
where if you pay for like six months at a time you get like for a dollar cheaper

3213
02:35:54,140 --> 02:36:02,540
per month technically right isn't worth it live listeners um our feed went down

3214
02:36:02,540 --> 02:36:05,820
but it's back up and that was us when amp crashed I don't know what it's

3215
02:36:05,820 --> 02:36:09,500
probably got sick of all the delay stuff that's going on on the other side I

3216
02:36:09,500 --> 02:36:12,740
don't know so I know you should just like let everybody call into Skype and

3217
02:36:12,740 --> 02:36:19,220
then we could just listen that way party you have a Skype party um but anyway if

3218
02:36:19,220 --> 02:36:23,140
we're done talking about that real quick I also wanted to mention that tap sonic

3219
02:36:23,140 --> 02:36:27,220
has also been taking over for me really um they updated the free songs and they

3220
02:36:27,220 --> 02:36:34,260
added some quote unquote American songs they're actually pretty fun to play like

3221
02:36:34,260 --> 02:36:39,180
passion pits on there Gwen Stefani is on there and then some new kpop got added

3222
02:36:39,180 --> 02:36:42,900
for free because I don't pay for stuff on that yet because I don't like micro

3223
02:36:42,900 --> 02:36:46,740
transactions right and you have to pay like each time you play a song right

3224
02:36:46,740 --> 02:36:53,820
yeah extra don't like that's dumb um and also technica threes soundtrack got

3225
02:36:53,820 --> 02:36:58,660
leaked and it's all over YouTube and I love it is there anything I'd actually

3226
02:36:58,660 --> 02:37:04,460
know huh is there anything I'd actually know in it uh it's got sampling masters

3227
02:37:04,460 --> 02:37:10,140
in it they do a song but I guess one of the people from sampling masters has

3228
02:37:10,140 --> 02:37:13,860
been the past few games and I didn't know that no but they put it like a lot

3229
02:37:13,860 --> 02:37:17,380
of happy hardcore in there like stuff I could see I'm one of the happy to be

3230

crash so try again maybe it's better now who knows doubt it fine bye bye so rude

3235

3236
02:37:46,500 --> 02:37:52,420
our next caller is nicer hi you're on orange launch radio who's this hello

3237

hola bienvenidos a orange lounge radio who's this stunned into silence hang up

3238
02:37:57,380 --> 02:38:01,300
there's a crank collar I guess they knew their connection wasn't working I don't

3239
02:38:01,300 --> 02:38:07,220
know 1 8 7 7 game olr or a username on skype is orange lounge radio and in the

3240
02:38:07,220 --> 02:38:12,180
meantime I'll try to go back to Twitter except I closed Firefox like a genius

3241
02:38:12,180 --> 02:38:17,100
genius I guess we could have kept Shane on that you know be optimistic about

3242
02:38:17,100 --> 02:38:25,260
things a little more I like Shane I like him when he's appropriate no I'm just

3243
02:38:25,260 --> 02:38:28,220
kidding I guess isn't appropriateness is part of what makes him

3244
02:38:28,220 --> 02:38:36,180
Shane right yep yes and you take your friends as they are or yes murder them

3245
02:38:36,180 --> 02:38:41,820
in their sleep I mean you take them as they are all right let's go to our

3246
02:38:41,820 --> 02:38:45,660
Twitter topics because I know we have at least a couple more coming in here now

3247
02:38:45,660 --> 02:38:52,200
Tigerclaw sent us some tweets take down notice against some Battlestar Galactica

3248
02:38:52,200 --> 02:38:58,900
modders this is a tweet a twink a tweet to us from Tigerclaw let's see a

3249
02:38:58,900 --> 02:39:04,520
Battlestar Galactica mod for Nexus and I guess this made the attention of NBC

3250
02:39:04,520 --> 02:39:09,560
Universal who sent a cease and desist letter to mod DB who'd been hosting the

3251
02:39:09,560 --> 02:39:14,260
work on it I don't even wow I don't even know what this is about here but of

3252
02:39:14,260 --> 02:39:20,500
course there is already a Battlestar Galactica online game so I'm sure this

3253
02:39:20,500 --> 02:39:25,020
is definitely a conflict of interest when you put Battlestar Galactica into

3254
02:39:25,020 --> 02:39:30,780
another game well it's also you know if you're doing a mod that's like with

3255
02:39:30,780 --> 02:39:35,740
licensed properties and stuff like that I mean that's kind of to be expected if

3256
02:39:35,740 --> 02:39:41,740
you know if you're doing your own mod or something like that you know and that's

3257
02:39:41,740 --> 02:39:46,060
a little different by the way this game had to remove everything that was

3258
02:39:46,060 --> 02:39:53,340
related to Battlestar Galactica so not just the popular one so bummer all right

3259
02:39:53,340 --> 02:40:01,140
let's see also hold on why are you calling back I don't know you didn't

3260
02:40:01,140 --> 02:40:07,420
have any other callers like I should tell time I just was slow in getting the

3261
02:40:07,420 --> 02:40:12,740
Twitter loaded I don't think so no yes I was sounded like because I had the feed

3262
02:40:12,740 --> 02:40:17,580
up and running and was the fees working now he was calling yeah if he was back

3263
02:40:17,580 --> 02:40:23,940
well then there you go yeah so I called so Battlestar Galactica season to say I

3264
02:40:23,940 --> 02:40:29,900
love that I'll start Galactica I know about that but as it has nothing to do

3265
02:40:29,900 --> 02:40:35,220
with the story did you even hear the story yes okay what was the story

3266
02:40:35,220 --> 02:40:40,140
NVC made them shut down some mod for some game that nobody plays okay good

3267
02:40:40,140 --> 02:40:46,660
job you pass pass the test so are you sad that they had to take down the mods

3268
02:40:46,660 --> 02:40:49,620
or you just I don't know how if you love Battlestar Galactica so much here's my

3269
02:40:49,620 --> 02:40:52,900
real question if you love it so much why aren't you playing the MMO I did for a

3270
02:40:52,900 --> 02:40:57,100
day and it was terrible really so I didn't play it anymore why was it

3271
02:40:57,100 --> 02:41:02,900
terrible I couldn't control my Cylon ship and I was like this isn't realistic

3272
02:41:02,900 --> 02:41:10,420
at all I'd be making out with helo or yeah that's really is awesome that's

3273
02:41:10,420 --> 02:41:15,540
absolutely realistic I'm sure in bow star Galactica it would be because he

3274
02:41:15,540 --> 02:41:22,260
loves Cylons and I was a Cylon all right all right I'm hanging up on you to get

3275
02:41:22,260 --> 02:41:26,760
some other calls you're tying up okay if there are finally people calling by one

3276
02:41:26,760 --> 02:41:32,340
eight seven seven game olr or username on skype is orange lounge radio so

3277
02:41:32,340 --> 02:41:35,780
meletops gone and we do have another call coming in so let's see

3278
02:41:35,780 --> 02:41:41,140
hi you're on orange lounge radio who's this oh it's legend of Zaku hey legend

3279
02:41:41,140 --> 02:41:45,660
of Zaku how you doing pretty good been doing stressful at work but you know

3280
02:41:45,660 --> 02:41:49,580
been hanging in there I hear usual it's been stressful my work too what's on

3281
02:41:49,580 --> 02:41:56,300
your mind buddy just the usual you know grasp of the fact that um even though

3282
02:41:56,300 --> 02:42:02,140
Steve Jobs did pass away it's like he his legacy in terms of how how he's

3283
02:42:02,140 --> 02:42:07,140
actually laid out a plan that might actually impact the way we view you know

3284
02:42:07,140 --> 02:42:11,060
any like portable dedicated gaming systems I'm just saying the fact that

3285
02:42:11,060 --> 02:42:15,420
you know his passing is pretty much you know give me a little bit of time to

3286
02:42:15,420 --> 02:42:19,700
reflect that mobile gaming might actually you know unless unless Nintendo

3287
02:42:19,700 --> 02:42:23,740
gets into the business selling phones well Sony's getting there getting there

3288
02:42:23,740 --> 02:42:26,940
as long as they buy out Erickson then they'll be set well but I'm more

3289
02:42:26,940 --> 02:42:29,980
concerned about Nintendo and the fact that they just like shrug it off with a

3290
02:42:29,980 --> 02:42:33,860
cavalier attitude if Nintendo you know started selling phones and they would

3291
02:42:33,860 --> 02:42:38,500
have to acknowledge the fact that there's online and well exactly you know

3292
02:42:38,500 --> 02:42:43,100
how that and this is and this is where you know these uh these mobile these

3293
02:42:43,100 --> 02:42:47,580
mobile game developers they they target that audience where they're basically

3294
02:42:47,580 --> 02:42:52,580
pissing in the same pool that Nintendo is you know spent hard cultivating ever

3295
02:42:52,580 --> 02:42:56,660
since the game the days of the Gameboy but the idea is that they're going after

3296
02:42:56,660 --> 02:43:02,860
the casuals I know it's a segment of the market that's like it's it's really hard

3297
02:43:02,860 --> 02:43:06,540
to break in because these are people who aren't like you know they're just

3298
02:43:06,540 --> 02:43:10,940
they're just typical folks they're not like your your average gamer you know

3299
02:43:10,940 --> 02:43:15,940
but the idea is that Nintendo it's you know they have such they're just

3300
02:43:15,940 --> 02:43:19,500
shrugging it off and they're good they're being so naive about like not

3301
02:43:19,500 --> 02:43:23,920
adapting like not realizing that the guys who you know the creators of Angry

3302
02:43:23,920 --> 02:43:27,780
Birds at the end of the day they're still gonna make bank while Nintendo is

3303
02:43:27,780 --> 02:43:30,900
gonna be scratching their head as to why they're not innovating why they're not

3304
02:43:30,900 --> 02:43:36,340
staying ahead of the curve and you can see as the Wii U you resolve the Wii U

3305
02:43:36,340 --> 02:43:44,620
is innovative the Wii U it's about you and it's just a Wii with a you know with

3306
02:43:44,620 --> 02:43:48,900
the touch remote and suppose it suppose it better graphics even though it's like

3307
02:43:48,900 --> 02:43:53,060
it's still being worked out hold on hold on hold on hold on cycle hold that

3308
02:43:53,060 --> 02:43:55,500
thought there's something really important I hate to interrupt our Sakura

3309
02:43:55,500 --> 02:44:00,980
are you really reading about Final Fantasy 14 over there yeah I was curious

3310
02:44:00,980 --> 02:44:05,140
oh dear it doesn't mean I'm gonna play it I was just looking you were

3311
02:44:05,140 --> 02:44:08,100
experimenting did I catch you experimenting in the middle of the show

3312
02:44:08,100 --> 02:44:13,740
I was just looking all right I had to give you crap all right sorry yeah it's

3313
02:44:13,740 --> 02:44:18,900
like you know it's if Nintendo were really you know if they were serious

3314
02:44:18,900 --> 02:44:23,300
about like trying to capture the the casuals they would have to like they

3315
02:44:23,300 --> 02:44:27,100
they wouldn't just act like they wouldn't have like an arrogant tone and

3316
02:44:27,100 --> 02:44:31,180
that's what I'm hearing you know that's what I hear from their bosses like they

3317
02:44:31,180 --> 02:44:35,780
they hate the the guy they're hating on the folks who you know on the Angry

3318
02:44:35,780 --> 02:44:40,300
Birds folks so the indie devs because at the end of the day who you know they're

3319
02:44:40,300 --> 02:44:44,120
gonna be pissed when their lunch gets eaten you know by those guys Steve

3320
02:44:44,120 --> 02:44:47,700
Steve Jobs his impact is gonna be felt for a long time and you know you were

3321
02:44:47,700 --> 02:44:49,860
mentioning about kind of his style I think a little bit there at the

3322
02:44:49,860 --> 02:44:52,500
beginning of the call did you hear that news report about that they're gonna

3323
02:44:52,500 --> 02:44:58,540
have executives kind of be taught on his styles well that's the thing you can't

3324
02:44:58,540 --> 02:45:03,900
really teach you can't really teach anyone else that type of style you know

3325
02:45:03,900 --> 02:45:07,940
you're with that ability to be a perfectionist I can I got it you can't

3326
02:45:07,940 --> 02:45:12,260
really teach an artist especially one that's born into it born with that

3327
02:45:12,260 --> 02:45:15,900
talent I mean you're sure they can become artists and they grow to realize

3328
02:45:15,900 --> 02:45:19,580
that they have the talent within them but you can't just force that person to

3329
02:45:19,580 --> 02:45:24,180
be a perfectionist to be as as meticulous as he was I mean you're bad

3330
02:45:24,180 --> 02:45:27,960
for that new guy a little the fact that he managed to change the you know my

3331
02:45:27,960 --> 02:45:32,300
industry which I actually do work in mobile so I was you know I was you know

3332
02:45:32,300 --> 02:45:36,020
the day that the day of the iPhone came out I realized that yeah I was gonna

3333
02:45:36,020 --> 02:45:40,580
history was changing you know with that with that very same blow you never

3334
02:45:40,580 --> 02:45:44,740
thought that we would go all the way from feature phones to high-end you know

3335
02:45:44,740 --> 02:45:47,980
two smartphones that people could buy for the same price as they were paying

3336
02:45:47,980 --> 02:45:51,660
for those shitty phones four years ago I gotta say though I I kind of feel bad

3337
02:45:51,660 --> 02:45:54,580
for that new guy that came in and stepped in as CEO I mean I know Steve

3338
02:45:54,580 --> 02:45:58,060
Jobs hand-picked him and I'm sure he's fine he's been he's probably really been

3339
02:45:58,060 --> 02:46:00,900
doing a lot more of the work for the past couple years but if you think about

3340
02:46:00,900 --> 02:46:05,660
it okay his first big press conference is about the iPhone 4s which is really

3341
02:46:05,660 --> 02:46:09,260
yeah yeah that was shocking I mean it was the fact that they couldn't even

3342
02:46:09,260 --> 02:46:13,900
like announce something greater than the iPhone 4 here's the problem I mean it is

3343
02:46:13,900 --> 02:46:16,900
what it is if Jobs has still been around that would have been his announcement to

3344
02:46:16,900 --> 02:46:21,060
make it I know but but think about this he knew Tim Cook had to know when he was

3345
02:46:21,060 --> 02:46:27,100
up on that stage that the former CEO was I mean he knew I'm sure he knew the

3346
02:46:27,100 --> 02:46:31,540
Steve Jobs was about to die well we actually well that was already known the

3347
02:46:31,540 --> 02:46:35,380
day he stepped down and that was like you know that was months ago I'm talking

3348
02:46:35,380 --> 02:46:43,860
the day tomorrow but the idea is that you know he said he paved the way in the

3349
02:46:43,860 --> 02:46:49,460
in the fact that he that you know mobile mobile gaming has like explode in the

3350
02:46:49,460 --> 02:46:53,900
past four to five years used to be a small niche market that only folks who

3351
02:46:53,900 --> 02:46:58,300
had the money to to pay for those shitty you know games for for those devices

3352
02:46:58,300 --> 02:47:02,180
back then but now it's like the quality is getting to the point where it might

3353
02:47:02,180 --> 02:47:07,460
even rival whatever Sony and Nintendo is actually spitting out I mean if you look

3354
02:47:07,460 --> 02:47:11,700
at the fact that these phones are like it's cheaper than the than the Vita

3355
02:47:11,700 --> 02:47:16,180
itself that they start cheaper than the Vita and they had just about this you

3356
02:47:16,180 --> 02:47:20,660
know just about the same number of games and the fact that the quality is damn

3357
02:47:20,660 --> 02:47:25,980
near almost ps2 level first you know for for a device that you know no greater

3358
02:47:25,980 --> 02:47:30,580
than four inches yeah that's pretty impressive hey hey hey hey all right all

3359
02:47:30,580 --> 02:47:34,740
right Zach we're gonna let you go so we wrap up but um thank you for your call

3360
02:47:34,740 --> 02:47:39,700
yeah anytime take care buddy all right I know he was definitely impacted by that

3361
02:47:39,700 --> 02:47:42,780
because you know if you listen to show before Zach was called in before and he

3362
02:47:42,780 --> 02:47:47,020
does work with mobile gaming and definitely we've seen more intervention

3363
02:47:47,020 --> 02:47:50,700
come out of the mobile world from Apple than anywhere really I think and

3364
02:47:50,700 --> 02:47:55,780
definitely not from Nokia all right that's gonna do it for calls tonight

3365
02:47:55,780 --> 02:47:58,340
sorry to those that didn't get through it but be sure to send us an email for

3366
02:47:58,340 --> 02:48:02,220
next week mailbag at orange laundry new calm or you could always send us a tweet

3367
02:48:02,220 --> 02:48:07,260
twitter.com slash OLR um I want to quickly quickly read one more tweet here

3368
02:48:07,260 --> 02:48:12,100
from Tiger Claw cuz I didn't get to this he sent a story from gamasutra about

3369
02:48:12,100 --> 02:48:16,060
this is kind of a longer article but I guess the headline is game developer

3370
02:48:16,060 --> 02:48:22,300
conference online web wise kids team for game promoting online child safety so

3371
02:48:22,300 --> 02:48:26,220
web wise kids is the game or no as the company then I guess they're just

3372
02:48:26,220 --> 02:48:30,200
promoting children being safe online I would assume like not sharing over

3373
02:48:30,200 --> 02:48:34,580
sharing personal details and so forth I there is a free title that's saying is

3374
02:48:34,580 --> 02:48:38,100
out there it's called passing the ball and it's an action game that follows a

3375
02:48:38,100 --> 02:48:41,700
parent and their child as they learn an important lesson about working together

3376
02:48:41,700 --> 02:48:46,540
I guess that it would be passing a ball which to me sounds a lot like you jump

3377
02:48:46,540 --> 02:48:54,860

3383
02:49:16,180 --> 02:49:22,700
game $1,000 was directly donated to this network to help the programs to promote

3384
02:49:22,700 --> 02:49:26,660
a culture of safety responsibility and respect for youth and families in the

3385
02:49:26,660 --> 02:49:32,260
digital world again watch your damn kids and make sure if they have a Facebook a

3386
02:49:32,260 --> 02:49:37,320
they ought to be at least like 13 or 14 but B if they aren't you're monitoring

3387
02:49:37,320 --> 02:49:40,540
it you know exactly what they're doing I have heard a really young permanently

3388
02:49:40,540 --> 02:49:43,900
blind them I have well I have heard about really young kids with Facebook

3389
02:49:43,900 --> 02:49:47,820
accounts mostly to play the games which is fine as long as the parent is kind of

3390
02:49:47,820 --> 02:49:51,300
you know has watching out the corner of their eye you know what they're doing

3391
02:49:51,300 --> 02:49:56,380
although I think standing there looking over their shoulder well yes and no I

3392
02:49:56,380 --> 02:49:59,760
mean you can't put the child on it I mean at the at the end of the day it's

3393
02:49:59,760 --> 02:50:03,740
up to the parent that's fine but I think and sometimes you should sit there and

3394
02:50:03,740 --> 02:50:06,820
want to play the game with them but maybe there's times where you you kind

3395
02:50:06,820 --> 02:50:10,060
of get it loaded for them and then you can walk away for a couple minutes give

3396
02:50:10,060 --> 02:50:13,140
that child a sense of safety whatever make sure that when you walk back that's

3397
02:50:13,140 --> 02:50:19,340
what they're still doing you know porn friends wanna porn Ville not porn Ville

3398
02:50:19,340 --> 02:50:25,860
forget it all right there you go that's gonna do it for another week here at

3399
02:50:25,860 --> 02:50:29,860
Orange Lounge Radio oh but I did miss one little little thing we got to do thank

3400
02:50:29,860 --> 02:50:32,780
you Loki for pointing this out I totally missed this earlier what can I say I'm

3401
02:50:32,780 --> 02:50:37,820
out of practice so it's time for the FUs of the week

3402
02:50:37,820 --> 02:51:00,140
if you to people who don't do their damn part that's it fucking my crappy crappy

3403
02:51:00,140 --> 02:51:07,140
crappy very very crappy firewall at work that doesn't allow us to play live very

3404
02:51:07,140 --> 02:51:13,620
well because of our strict NAT settings and it's funny our I you know our IT guy

3405
02:51:13,620 --> 02:51:20,580
actually opened the NAT ports for my system made it worse so that's great

3406
02:51:20,580 --> 02:51:23,300
unfortunately they're gonna be installing a new firewall in a couple

3407
02:51:23,300 --> 02:51:27,340
weeks and if that doesn't work he's gonna put our systems outside the

3408
02:51:27,340 --> 02:51:33,980
firewall so that hopefully that won't be a problem all right a few to headaches

3409
02:51:33,980 --> 02:51:37,340
I've been getting some huge ones today and it's just it's not been good I'm

3410
02:51:37,340 --> 02:51:42,980
very sad but I did really wear myself out yesterday so that could be like part

3411
02:51:42,980 --> 02:51:49,460
of the reason why so I don't know that's it for that fuse of the week now we can

3412
02:51:49,460 --> 02:51:54,140
start to wrap up the show actually I got to ask Loki do you have any email last

3413
02:51:54,140 --> 02:51:59,340
minute last minute stories for us no I'm not gonna look anything up fine then

3414
02:51:59,340 --> 02:52:02,460
we'll go around and get everybody's final thought Loki will start with you

3415
02:52:02,460 --> 02:52:09,020
my final thought is opening our opening on the 12th will be voting for the

3416
02:52:09,020 --> 02:52:13,540
podcast awards so don't forget to vote every day every single day tell your

3417
02:52:13,540 --> 02:52:20,060
friends tell your enemies just make sure you vote every single day and especially

3418
02:52:20,060 --> 02:52:28,180
tell your frenemies yes my final thought is tacos if we win the podcast award we

3419
02:52:28,180 --> 02:52:33,940
will celebrate with a taco party that's for sure is that your final thought

3420

3421

3422
02:52:45,020 --> 02:52:48,380
radio show always do it hey if you like the show all we ask tell a friend about

3423
02:52:48,380 --> 02:52:50,980
the show help spread the word remember guys we don't have advertising dollars

3424
02:52:50,980 --> 02:52:54,780
it's part of the reason that we we were hoping we'd get nominated for the

3425
02:52:54,780 --> 02:52:59,100
podcast award is because it's great exposure and you know we can't we don't

3426
02:52:59,100 --> 02:53:03,500
have a big magazine or a giant website that backs us up so thanks again as

3427
