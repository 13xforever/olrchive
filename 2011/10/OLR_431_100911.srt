9
00:01:27,651 --> 00:01:28,991
[SPEAKER_11]: We had such a derpy.

10
00:01:29,111 --> 00:01:31,052
[SPEAKER_04]: I heard about the derp-isodes while I was gone.

11
00:01:31,072 --> 00:01:32,292
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, we called them derp-isodes.

12
00:01:32,372 --> 00:01:41,716
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't heard, just like the podcast listeners, which I apologize for in advance, I haven't heard last week's, but I heard about half of the one from two weeks ago on my commute to work.

13
00:01:42,696 --> 00:01:45,657
[SPEAKER_04]: The one from two weeks ago was like two minutes?

14
00:01:46,117 --> 00:01:47,778
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you guys just flew through the news.

15
00:01:47,998 --> 00:01:50,639
[SPEAKER_11]: And I did like a bajillion hours of Pump Up the Volume.

00:01:51,362 --> 00:02:05,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Not tonight though, we have a huge show tonight We have big announcements, big stuff to talk about tonight Of course I have to introduce the other guy here on the show Say hello to Techmaster Loki And I'll have you know for the record, I'm always questionable What?

00:02:06,488 --> 00:02:07,828
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't wait to hear your last week's show

18
00:02:26,093 --> 00:02:27,174
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been extremely busy.

19
00:02:27,615 --> 00:02:29,036
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I know what you're going to think, though.

20
00:02:29,156 --> 00:02:30,998
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, yeah, the reason why I miss the shows.

21
00:02:31,438 --> 00:02:33,320
[SPEAKER_04]: I went to a rock concert two weeks ago.

22
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,423
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, it's a band I've missed like three times.

23
00:02:36,924 --> 00:02:40,007
[SPEAKER_04]: And I said, I am seeing Lady Tron this time come hell or high water.

24
00:02:40,067 --> 00:02:40,687
[SPEAKER_04]: And it rocked.

25
00:02:41,989 --> 00:02:42,849
[SPEAKER_11]: But they only want you when you're 17.

26
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:45,592
[SPEAKER_04]: And then last week, when you're 21, you're no fun.

27
00:02:46,092 --> 00:02:47,213
[SPEAKER_04]: Last week I went to Disneyland.

28
00:02:47,313 --> 00:02:48,354
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, rough life, right?

29
00:02:48,715 --> 00:02:51,097
[SPEAKER_04]: But I came back to just craziness at work.

30
00:02:51,677 --> 00:02:56,001
[SPEAKER_04]: And I had this performance I was doing last night.

31
00:02:56,181 --> 00:02:59,264
[SPEAKER_04]: I participated in a local production of Repo the Genetic Opera.

32
00:03:00,105 --> 00:03:00,805
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, the movie.

33
00:03:00,905 --> 00:03:03,287
[SPEAKER_04]: They do shadow casting for that now, a la Rocky Horror.

34
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:08,452
[SPEAKER_04]: Which, as you guys may or may not know, Rocky Horror is kind of the reason I got into podcasting in the first place.

35
00:03:08,472 --> 00:03:10,494
[SPEAKER_04]: Because Rocky Horror led to Under Sedation Live.

36
00:03:10,834 --> 00:03:11,114
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

37
00:03:32,867 --> 00:03:44,903
[SPEAKER_04]: and it was a great show man when they did some of like the killing scenes they did that whole thing where like the blood sprays out in the audience over the first five rows it was awesome so big kudos to the folks here in SAC that made that happen

38
00:03:45,801 --> 00:03:47,141
[SPEAKER_09]: And my friend played Blind Mag.

39
00:03:48,022 --> 00:03:49,902
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, she was phenomenal.

40
00:03:50,102 --> 00:03:50,802
[SPEAKER_04]: She's really good.

41
00:03:50,822 --> 00:03:51,643
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my gosh, I loved her.

42
00:03:51,683 --> 00:03:54,223
[SPEAKER_04]: She was, as they would say, fierce.

43
00:03:54,503 --> 00:03:55,503
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't get to go last night.

44
00:03:55,543 --> 00:03:59,004
[SPEAKER_11]: I wanted to, but she has that dramatic quality in life.

45
00:04:00,185 --> 00:04:03,465
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't want to ruin the movie too much, but it's been out a few years now.

46
00:04:03,505 --> 00:04:09,107
[SPEAKER_04]: She has a pretty dramatic death scene that's very over the top and just awesome to watch.

47
00:04:09,587 --> 00:04:11,687
[SPEAKER_04]: So, anyhow.

48
00:04:11,807 --> 00:04:13,328
[SPEAKER_11]: Only good role Sarah Silverman's ever done.

49
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:15,496
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

50
00:04:36,053 --> 00:04:36,794
[SPEAKER_11]: Hater in it.

51
00:04:36,954 --> 00:04:38,055
[SPEAKER_11]: Hater, hater, hater, hater.

52
00:04:38,616 --> 00:04:41,759
[SPEAKER_11]: But she was really, really good as Blind Mag.

53
00:04:41,979 --> 00:04:42,980
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I agree.

54
00:04:44,061 --> 00:04:53,630
[SPEAKER_04]: And to bring this back to games, Repo, even though some people don't really like it as a movie and say it's a terrible movie because it is a little weird.

55
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:56,072
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the guy who did Saw doing a rock opera.

56
00:04:56,773 --> 00:04:58,755
[SPEAKER_04]: And like opera, meaning everything is sung.

57
00:04:59,475 --> 00:05:00,075
[SPEAKER_09]: Tony Head.

58
00:05:00,536 --> 00:05:01,396
[SPEAKER_04]: Anthony Stewart Head.

59
00:05:01,896 --> 00:05:02,236
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.

60
00:05:02,736 --> 00:05:05,918
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's told in that kind of comic book style and it's just neat.

61
00:05:06,058 --> 00:05:06,758
[SPEAKER_04]: It's something you should see.

62
00:05:07,418 --> 00:05:07,699
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow.

63
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,419
[SPEAKER_04]: And they should make a game out of it.

64
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,600
[SPEAKER_04]: Back to video games for a minute.

65
00:05:12,841 --> 00:05:15,862
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously this has been like everywhere this week but we have to mention it.

66
00:05:15,902 --> 00:05:16,342
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to.

67
00:05:17,103 --> 00:05:19,604
[SPEAKER_04]: Steve Jobs passed away this week and it's kind of one of those things.

68
00:05:20,204 --> 00:05:21,184
[SPEAKER_04]: It's insanely sad.

69
00:05:22,025 --> 00:05:26,166
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it's been all over CNN and especially all over Twitter and Facebook and so forth.

70
00:05:26,186 --> 00:05:27,587
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you guys have heard a lot about it but

71
00:05:27,987 --> 00:05:28,648
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

72
00:05:43,966 --> 00:06:12,603
[SPEAKER_04]: and plus you know it was called podcasting in the beginning even before iTunes because and we were actually doing a show back before iTunes that's how long the show's been going on your old RSS would kind of you could get these programs that would actually still sync them to your iPod because they weren't iPhones back then but iPods and you kind of sync it that way and so there were ways to do what iTunes was doing before that but it was always designed with that portable on the go thing in mind

73
00:06:13,443 --> 00:06:13,963
[SPEAKER_04]: In a garage.

74
00:06:32,832 --> 00:06:35,054
[SPEAKER_11]: The original was in the garage.

75
00:06:35,134 --> 00:06:41,057
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, that leads to Apple II, which is what anybody who grew up in the 80s, we all did.

76
00:06:41,137 --> 00:06:45,940
[SPEAKER_11]: How many of us played Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego on one of those rectangular bricks?

77
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:49,482
[SPEAKER_04]: Or Oregon Trail, or Math Blasters.

78
00:06:49,502 --> 00:06:52,224
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a huge part of our education.

79
00:06:52,284 --> 00:06:57,727
[SPEAKER_04]: To me, it was always really looking forward to computer lab day.

80
00:06:58,507 --> 00:07:00,828
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure you other nerds feel the same way, right?

81
00:07:00,888 --> 00:07:04,650
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just like Computer Lab Day was awesome We didn't have computers in Alabama Really?

82
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:20,136
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh No, we had like I actually believed you for a minute We actually had one Apple IIe in the library Which I would just go play all the time And then we had like the tall brick Macs, you know what I mean?

83
00:07:20,516 --> 00:07:25,938
[SPEAKER_11]: Right At a couple of the facilities that I used to do volunteer work at

84
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:34,426
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it wasn't for him, we wouldn't have the MacBook and we wouldn't have been able to upload the virus to the alien mothership to save the world on Independence Day.

85
00:07:34,926 --> 00:07:36,267
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely, absolutely.

86
00:07:36,508 --> 00:07:41,571
[SPEAKER_04]: Very important contribution is that Steve Jobs did contribute to saving us from virus.

87
00:07:42,152 --> 00:07:43,313
[SPEAKER_11]: But I'll tell you something.

88
00:07:43,813 --> 00:07:49,697
[SPEAKER_11]: Even back in the day, the first really good graphics programs were developed on Mac.

89
00:07:50,758 --> 00:07:51,919
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's why, I mean...

90
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,680
[SPEAKER_04]: Max were in schools everywhere.

91
00:07:54,461 --> 00:08:00,044
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially when you and I were growing up and Loki, Max were everywhere in our schools.

92
00:08:00,184 --> 00:08:04,587
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a really smart ploy on Apple's part, but certainly you get attached to it.

93
00:08:05,188 --> 00:08:08,670
[SPEAKER_04]: I was in yearbook, which I know is something very similar to what you do now.

94
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:10,371
[SPEAKER_04]: You might not do yearbook, but you do publishing.

95
00:08:10,731 --> 00:08:13,333
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, we did that shit on PageMaker on a Mac.

96
00:08:13,513 --> 00:08:14,674
[SPEAKER_04]: It was good times.

97
00:08:15,415 --> 00:08:16,876
[SPEAKER_11]: Now we're like, did you use PageMaker?

98
00:08:17,616 --> 00:08:18,517
[SPEAKER_11]: InDesign, hello.

99
00:08:19,217 --> 00:08:20,218
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, but Adobe...

100
00:08:21,699 --> 00:08:28,243
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, even fully supported the Mac platform for ages until they finally realized, oh yeah, PC's caught up.

101
00:08:28,363 --> 00:08:28,644
[SPEAKER_11]: Oops.

102
00:08:29,885 --> 00:08:33,247
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, there was also the gaming connection too on the 2600.

103
00:08:33,687 --> 00:08:36,949
[SPEAKER_04]: Jobs had played a role in Breakout on the Atari 2600.

104
00:08:37,970 --> 00:09:04,696
[SPEAKER_04]: that's one of the more kind of I mean Woz you know talked about how he kind of got shafted on the Atari bonus on that game but regardless of you know all that and how things went down it's you know he did kind of have that more direct impact on the gaming industry and I gotta say this you guys this is the one that people forget about I think or not everybody but you know some people have forgot about CNN stuff I think is the most important in some ways things he did he brought Pixar back and like Pixar

105
00:09:05,956 --> 00:09:06,677
[SPEAKER_04]: is amazing.

106
00:09:06,757 --> 00:09:08,298
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, the movies they make and everything.

107
00:09:08,358 --> 00:09:14,043
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, if you hate every single Pixar movie that's ever been made, I question your taste.

108
00:09:14,103 --> 00:09:15,064
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry to say.

109
00:09:15,444 --> 00:09:19,407
[SPEAKER_04]: But, like, you know, and Pixar has made some that you may not like.

110
00:09:19,467 --> 00:09:22,090
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I know not everybody dug Cars 2 or Ratatouille.

111
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:22,990
[SPEAKER_02]: Or A Bug's Life.

112
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:28,875
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, but seriously, like, Wall-E, Up, Toy Story 1, 2, or 3, take your pick.

113
00:09:28,915 --> 00:09:31,297
[SPEAKER_04]: How often does a movie like that have so many great sequels?

114
00:09:31,698 --> 00:09:31,978
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?

115
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:33,099
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

116
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:38,866
[SPEAKER_11]: I do have to say though, most CG movies today are made in Linux based programs.

117
00:09:52,262 --> 00:09:56,125
[SPEAKER_04]: There's still some today that kind of feel that traditional animation is best.

118
00:09:56,605 --> 00:10:00,067
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we're getting to a place where you get a good mix of the two.

119
00:10:00,387 --> 00:10:02,268
[SPEAKER_04]: There's been some great traditionally animated ones.

120
00:10:02,308 --> 00:10:03,909
[SPEAKER_04]: I like Princess and the Frog an awful lot.

121
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:05,971
[SPEAKER_04]: Boo!

122
00:10:06,511 --> 00:10:06,671
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

123
00:10:06,691 --> 00:10:07,412
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't like that movie?

124
00:10:07,512 --> 00:10:08,072
[SPEAKER_04]: It was terrible.

125
00:10:08,332 --> 00:10:08,952
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't seen it.

126
00:10:09,013 --> 00:10:11,194
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was great.

127
00:10:11,214 --> 00:10:11,834
[SPEAKER_04]: Hater.

128
00:10:11,954 --> 00:10:15,717
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously the stuff Pixar does, even up through Tangled, were really, really good movies.

129
00:10:15,997 --> 00:10:17,658
[SPEAKER_04]: I know Tangled was not technically Pixar, but...

130
00:10:19,098 --> 00:10:46,125
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean you look at DreamWorks look at any of them I mean basically Pixar really innovated the genre so yeah a tip of the hat to a guy who was very sassy too like in the way he ran his company was very unlike other CEOs so a tip of the hat to Steve Jobs and rest in peace sadly I think we all kind of I mean when it happened it was like oh wow but I think we all kind of we all kind of knew

131
00:10:46,565 --> 00:10:47,246
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

132
00:11:04,517 --> 00:11:05,638
[SPEAKER_04]: Pancreas Pancreas Pancreas

133
00:11:25,599 --> 00:11:35,104
[SPEAKER_04]: and it's no joke and I was very scared there for a minute when they had to do the MRI on it because they told me flat out they had to rule out pancreatic cancer because I had a growth on my pancreas.

134
00:11:35,324 --> 00:11:37,346
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank heavens it was just a cyst.

135
00:11:37,866 --> 00:11:41,788
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, I absolutely feel and I know it had to be a great deal of pain.

136
00:11:41,808 --> 00:11:43,069
[SPEAKER_09]: And now it's been stopped and desisted.

137
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:46,911
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, in his case, you know... I meant for you.

138
00:11:47,111 --> 00:11:47,531
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, for me?

139
00:11:47,611 --> 00:11:48,452
[SPEAKER_09]: Stopped and desisted.

140
00:11:49,832 --> 00:11:50,293
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I get it.

141
00:11:50,313 --> 00:11:51,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Desisted.

142
00:11:51,113 --> 00:11:51,693
[SPEAKER_04]: Har, har.

143
00:11:52,154 --> 00:11:53,835
[SPEAKER_04]: But no, at least for him, he's not in pain anymore.

144
00:11:54,075 --> 00:11:57,657
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, you gotta imagine, like, he was up on the stage as late as, what, April?

145
00:11:57,957 --> 00:12:00,118
[SPEAKER_11]: He did that... It was the Stanford thing, too.

146
00:12:00,138 --> 00:12:01,599
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that was back in like, oh, five.

147
00:12:01,899 --> 00:12:03,760
[SPEAKER_04]: But April was the whole iCloud thing.

148
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:04,080
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

149
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,141
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, you know, he was on stage for that.

150
00:12:06,341 --> 00:12:09,943
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you consider that was six months before he ultimately passed away...

151
00:12:12,165 --> 00:12:19,768
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just glad he's not in pain anymore and I hope his family and all that is doing okay.

152
00:12:20,469 --> 00:12:21,889
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just going to turn the car, complete 180.

153
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:25,351
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to go from really, really sad news to really happy news.

154
00:12:26,031 --> 00:12:26,792
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm turning the car around.

155
00:12:27,092 --> 00:12:28,433
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we're going to Disneyland, everybody.

156
00:12:31,974 --> 00:12:37,997
[SPEAKER_04]: We mentioned a couple weeks ago on the show that we would really appreciate it if you guys would nominate us for the podcast award, which we won back in 2005.

157
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:54,259
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even think we've been nominated since, maybe like one time, I don't remember, but it's mostly been, especially in those first couple years, 06, 07, a lot of like the corporate cast, and you know, a nomination in there would go a long way towards exposure for the show and everything, and

158
00:12:54,759 --> 00:12:55,840
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, we got nominated!

159
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:56,560
[SPEAKER_04]: We did!

160
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:57,721
[SPEAKER_04]: It was announced yesterday.

161
00:12:57,841 --> 00:12:58,581
[SPEAKER_04]: We got nominated!

162
00:12:58,941 --> 00:13:00,862
[SPEAKER_04]: PodcastWords.com if you want to check it out.

163
00:13:01,302 --> 00:13:02,063
[SPEAKER_04]: It's amazing.

164
00:13:02,883 --> 00:13:11,208
[SPEAKER_04]: And what's really amazing, I'm going to be honest, the other shows that are nominated, I think all but one or maybe two of them are indie shows.

165
00:13:11,228 --> 00:13:12,148
[SPEAKER_04]: You're talking like ten shows.

166
00:13:12,548 --> 00:13:14,089
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's some awesome indie shows in there.

167
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:19,692
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I feel very confident that some indie is going to walk away with it.

168
00:13:20,613 --> 00:13:21,253
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's great.

169
00:13:21,873 --> 00:13:23,354
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and Indy's going to be getting the exposure.

170
00:13:23,494 --> 00:13:25,475
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I'd rather be our Indy.

171
00:13:26,615 --> 00:13:28,136
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, sure, not going to lie.

172
00:13:28,156 --> 00:13:29,857
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be awfully nice.

173
00:13:29,877 --> 00:13:32,358
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I want us to be nominated just to lose.

174
00:13:33,138 --> 00:13:38,641
[SPEAKER_11]: It would be awfully nice, but... If you don't vote for us, we'll eat wet cigarette butts.

175
00:13:40,522 --> 00:14:00,434
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't care We'll throw a protest No, obviously we would love a vote And voting opens on the 12th at podcastawards.com It's this interesting thing where you have to vote every day So please vote often And yeah, we would really appreciate it That would be great But win or lose, we're going to just keep doing what we always do, right kids?

176
00:14:00,674 --> 00:14:07,718
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, being awesome I'm going to quit if we lose I'm done, stomp Alright

177
00:14:08,975 --> 00:14:11,898
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's move on and talk about, we gotta get back to video games.

178
00:14:12,258 --> 00:14:17,022
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about our gaming weeks and the stuff that we have been playing this week.

179
00:14:17,142 --> 00:14:18,223
[SPEAKER_04]: So DarkSakura, we'll start with you.

180
00:14:18,363 --> 00:14:19,044
[SPEAKER_04]: How was your gaming week?

181
00:14:19,184 --> 00:14:20,525
[SPEAKER_11]: I really haven't played much of anything.

182
00:14:20,765 --> 00:14:23,167
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, just because I've been super busy with school.

183
00:14:23,968 --> 00:14:25,149
[SPEAKER_04]: Excuses, excuses.

184
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:29,332
[SPEAKER_11]: I was on WoW just long enough to do dailies and that's it, really.

185
00:14:29,352 --> 00:14:35,418
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I did like one instance and, you know, but like yesterday was Yom Kippur.

186
00:14:36,098 --> 00:14:36,699
[SPEAKER_04]: Yom Kippur

187
00:14:51,129 --> 00:14:52,470
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

188
00:15:11,381 --> 00:15:29,322
[SPEAKER_11]: but I mean it's it's but for me it was just sort of like stepping away from everything you know I turned off my phone I turned off my computer you know I and yeah the fasting thing is never fun but I spent a lot more time around people

189
00:15:30,855 --> 00:15:34,317
[SPEAKER_04]: I gotta say, you know, my friends, some of my friends and I used to do a trip.

190
00:15:34,397 --> 00:15:35,337
[SPEAKER_04]: Sadly, we don't do it anymore.

191
00:15:35,377 --> 00:15:43,061
[SPEAKER_04]: We used to do a trip every year to Mendocino and we would stay in a house that was quote unquote off the grid because you literally don't have cell service when you're that close to the ocean.

192
00:15:43,622 --> 00:15:46,863
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, just it was actually a really neat, neat trip.

193
00:15:46,883 --> 00:15:50,685
[SPEAKER_04]: And it forced me to get away from all that and just be with people, which was which was great.

194
00:15:51,025 --> 00:15:58,669
[SPEAKER_11]: So I have to say that actually it's been a good week of disconnecting from from the games and the Internet.

195
00:15:58,849 --> 00:16:02,452
[SPEAKER_04]: So your gaming week has consisted of being anti-technology.

196
00:16:03,714 --> 00:16:04,494
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a vacation.

197
00:16:04,634 --> 00:16:05,375
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a vacation.

198
00:16:05,695 --> 00:16:07,737
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I found a game that I totally have to have.

199
00:16:08,378 --> 00:16:11,481
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's that Kirby 10 Kirby game.

200
00:16:13,788 --> 00:16:18,652
[SPEAKER_11]: Kirby's broken up into 10 parts and you have to find all of his parts and then you attack things by throwing a bunch of Kirbys at it.

201
00:16:19,412 --> 00:16:19,952
[SPEAKER_11]: I want that game.

202
00:16:20,953 --> 00:16:21,493
[SPEAKER_11]: Mass Attack.

203
00:16:21,534 --> 00:16:21,794
[SPEAKER_11]: That's it.

204
00:16:21,834 --> 00:16:22,354
[SPEAKER_11]: I want that game.

205
00:16:22,854 --> 00:16:23,335
[SPEAKER_04]: Go get it.

206
00:16:23,895 --> 00:16:24,455
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm broke.

207
00:16:25,936 --> 00:16:34,122
[SPEAKER_04]: I will fill in for your gaming week then since you were on a religious observance and so forth through the week with what some folks in chat have been playing.

208
00:16:35,163 --> 00:16:38,965
[SPEAKER_04]: YYR in our chatroom says, I bought a Turbo Duo with 11 games.

209
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:41,027
[SPEAKER_04]: Not that I have much to explain or anything.

210
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:42,648
[SPEAKER_11]: Because this show is rated TG-16.

211
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:52,875
[SPEAKER_04]: Entitalitis, hope I said that right, said My Gaming Week, Street Fighter 3, Third Strike Online, bought DJ Hero 2 on a whim at Big Lots.

212
00:16:52,955 --> 00:16:57,598
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if they were selling it at Big Lots, that means it was probably $10, hence why he probably got it on a whim.

213
00:16:58,039 --> 00:16:58,579
[SPEAKER_04]: So, awesome.

214
00:16:58,599 --> 00:16:59,139
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a good whim.

215
00:16:59,420 --> 00:16:59,920
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a good whim.

216
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,641
[SPEAKER_04]: I think DJ Hero is a pretty underrated series.

217
00:17:02,661 --> 00:17:03,301
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a lot of fun.

218
00:17:03,581 --> 00:17:06,662
[SPEAKER_02]: It's unfortunately like the other music games that I played.

219
00:17:08,203 --> 00:17:08,943
[SPEAKER_02]: I buy it.

220
00:17:09,043 --> 00:17:09,903
[SPEAKER_02]: I get all excited about it.

221
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:13,364
[SPEAKER_02]: Play it a little bit and then it goes away for a while.

222
00:17:13,524 --> 00:17:17,506
[SPEAKER_02]: But then eventually once I have nothing to do, I'll go back and play it again.

223
00:17:18,326 --> 00:17:21,088
[SPEAKER_04]: It didn't have fabulous longevity.

224
00:17:21,128 --> 00:17:26,271
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think the fact that it has such a large controller that you have to kind of like put away, then get out, plug in.

225
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:30,754
[SPEAKER_04]: I think honestly, when people want to play, sometimes they just want to turn on the system and go.

226
00:17:31,314 --> 00:17:31,995
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know.

227
00:17:33,335 --> 00:17:35,397
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, DJ Hero at least was a great game.

228
00:17:36,177 --> 00:17:37,338
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, Loki, how was your gaming week?

229
00:17:37,705 --> 00:17:38,265
[SPEAKER_02]: It was pretty good.

230
00:17:38,325 --> 00:17:39,446
[SPEAKER_02]: I played a few things.

231
00:17:41,266 --> 00:17:46,088
[SPEAKER_02]: Grand Theft Auto, barely, because our firewall has been absolute shit.

232
00:17:46,448 --> 00:17:57,111
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently Microsoft went down, Live went down for a little bit on Monday, and for some reason after that, our firewall has just been absolute shit.

233
00:17:57,191 --> 00:18:04,794
[SPEAKER_02]: We were lucky to get four out of the five consoles connected to Live in a game together and actually be able to stay in.

234
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:05,954
[SPEAKER_02]: It has been more of like

235
00:18:06,674 --> 00:18:07,695
[SPEAKER_02]: Dead Rising 2 Off The Record

236
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:35,136
[SPEAKER_02]: Which I was really excited about that and it's a pretty awesome game.

237
00:18:36,778 --> 00:18:47,248
[SPEAKER_02]: The only disappointment I have with the game is Dead Rising 2, one of the things I hated was the fact that you had to keep going back to give your stupid daughter Zombrex.

238
00:18:48,143 --> 00:18:55,044
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, cool, Dead Rising 2 off the record is going to be awesome because you don't have to do that anymore.

239
00:18:55,904 --> 00:19:01,165
[SPEAKER_02]: No, this time Frank West is infected and he needs to take Zombrex.

240
00:19:01,245 --> 00:19:04,226
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was like, oh, come on.

241
00:19:04,626 --> 00:19:09,687
[SPEAKER_02]: Thankfully, when I did that, when I got to that point, I was like, oh, come on.

242
00:19:10,167 --> 00:19:13,427
[SPEAKER_02]: I switched right over to sandbox mode and there's none of that shit.

243
00:19:13,588 --> 00:19:16,088
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just killing zombies and that's it.

244
00:19:16,528 --> 00:19:21,109
[SPEAKER_02]: Funny enough, the way the beginning of that... Is this game already out or is it coming out?

245
00:19:21,229 --> 00:19:21,669
[SPEAKER_04]: It's coming out.

246
00:19:21,849 --> 00:19:22,109
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

247
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:28,891
[SPEAKER_02]: So the way it kind of begins in the sandbox mode, he's being dropped out of a helicopter, much like the first game.

248
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:31,072
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're all, so are you covering your next big scoop here?

249
00:19:31,112 --> 00:19:33,112
[SPEAKER_02]: He's all, no, not this time.

250
00:19:33,452 --> 00:19:35,493
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my vacation!

251
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:38,894
[SPEAKER_02]: And does a roll onto the roof and then just starts killing zombies.

252
00:19:39,374 --> 00:19:43,795
[SPEAKER_02]: But everything transfers back and forth, your experience and costumes and crap that you get.

253
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:54,061
[SPEAKER_02]: So right now I went through a sex shop, so I had a bunch of weird village people-esque stuff on.

254
00:19:54,081 --> 00:19:58,664
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, when I think of the village people, I don't necessarily think of sex.

255
00:19:58,944 --> 00:20:01,266
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, chaps, okay.

256
00:20:01,346 --> 00:20:02,747
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe it's a generation thing.

257
00:20:02,907 --> 00:20:04,848
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's more like leather chaps.

258
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:05,793
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

259
00:20:06,773 --> 00:20:07,854
[SPEAKER_02]: Just for whatever reason.

260
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:09,394
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just picking up all the clothes on the way.

261
00:20:09,454 --> 00:20:11,435
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever ends up happening, that's fine.

262
00:20:11,455 --> 00:20:12,315
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's shopping.

263
00:20:12,935 --> 00:20:15,696
[SPEAKER_02]: But now I have this weird mask and bullhorns on my head.

264
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:21,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Not gonna lie, I always got the biggest kick out of playing a furry in Dead Rising and putting on the big furry costume.

265
00:20:21,778 --> 00:20:22,559
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't gotten there yet.

266
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:24,620
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's pretty fun.

267
00:20:26,242 --> 00:20:27,703
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I'm a furry, virtually.

268
00:20:28,664 --> 00:20:33,828
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's nice to be able to do the photography stuff.

269
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:44,016
[SPEAKER_02]: Frank, even in the main story mission, which I'll probably go back to that, it's still pretty funny because the dialogue and stuff is a little bit different.

270
00:20:44,036 --> 00:20:47,259
[SPEAKER_02]: But a lot of the stuff that happens in the game is kind of similar.

271
00:20:48,099 --> 00:20:48,440
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

272
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,862
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be interesting to see how the game plays out.

273
00:20:52,091 --> 00:20:56,592
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, so I'd recommend picking up, especially since it's not even a full price game, it's just $40.

274
00:20:56,632 --> 00:21:00,314
[SPEAKER_02]: Holy!

275
00:21:00,614 --> 00:21:03,335
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like Dead Rising 2, but better, so yeah.

276
00:21:03,355 --> 00:21:07,456
[SPEAKER_04]: It's priced where most games ought to be, in my opinion, but anyway.

277
00:21:07,856 --> 00:21:10,617
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so definitely worth picking up.

278
00:21:11,963 --> 00:21:13,384
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty much all I've played this week.

279
00:21:13,804 --> 00:21:14,164
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

280
00:21:14,905 --> 00:21:16,906
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, hey, let's go to my game of the week.

281
00:21:16,926 --> 00:21:17,507
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no, I'm sorry.

282
00:21:17,807 --> 00:21:18,147
[SPEAKER_02]: Burnout.

283
00:21:18,667 --> 00:21:19,168
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm sorry.

284
00:21:19,568 --> 00:21:19,968
[SPEAKER_02]: One last thing.

285
00:21:20,228 --> 00:21:20,929
[SPEAKER_02]: Burnout Crash.

286
00:21:20,989 --> 00:21:22,590
[SPEAKER_02]: Played that a little bit, and that's actually pretty fun.

287
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:27,133
[SPEAKER_02]: Despite the fact that I really hated the idea of a top-down Burnout, but it's actually a pretty fun game.

288
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:28,910
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, you done?

289
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:29,570
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm done.

290
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:29,951
[SPEAKER_04]: You sure?

291
00:21:30,371 --> 00:21:32,791
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

292
00:21:33,091 --> 00:21:36,952
[SPEAKER_04]: So I haven't played a whole lot of games, especially this week.

293
00:21:36,972 --> 00:21:38,353
[SPEAKER_04]: I already told you guys I've been busy as hell.

294
00:21:39,373 --> 00:21:47,295
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, besides the Disneyland games, because you know whenever I go to Disneyland I gotta go to Flynn's Arcade because Electronica was back and play some classic games there.

295
00:21:47,335 --> 00:21:48,436
[SPEAKER_04]: They did mix them up a little bit.

296
00:21:48,476 --> 00:21:51,897
[SPEAKER_04]: I noticed some games were gone, but I play stuff like Frogger that's always there.

297
00:21:53,377 --> 00:21:57,258
[SPEAKER_04]: And I also, you know, of course Midway Mania, which is a lot of fun.

298
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:58,721
[SPEAKER_04]: GamePricing.com

299
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:35,171
[SPEAKER_04]: and that is where you basically pay what you want for the game Frozen Synapse and it comes with the game Spacechem as well and if you're not familiar with Humble Bundle they just had one of these like not even a month or two ago because I remember that's how I got VVVVVVV

300
00:22:36,251 --> 00:22:37,392
[SPEAKER_04]: was in one of these Humble Bundles.

301
00:22:37,512 --> 00:22:45,176
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a very interesting new way to price games where people can kind of pay what they want.

302
00:22:45,236 --> 00:22:52,460
[SPEAKER_04]: And these games are not necessarily new, but they're good games.

303
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:59,063
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think something a lot of people may not have given another look if they didn't have this whole pay what you want thing going on.

304
00:22:59,783 --> 00:23:01,564
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think they're making pretty good money off of it.

305
00:23:01,844 --> 00:23:03,924
[SPEAKER_04]: And a chunk of it goes to charity, which I think is great.

306
00:23:03,984 --> 00:23:05,465
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not just Spacechem either.

307
00:23:05,545 --> 00:23:07,465
[SPEAKER_02]: You do get a bunch of other free stuff.

308
00:23:07,485 --> 00:23:07,865
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, hold on.

309
00:23:07,885 --> 00:23:08,545
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to put this out.

310
00:23:08,585 --> 00:23:14,587
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you spend more than the average, which right now is $4.75, you get some other games as well.

311
00:23:14,967 --> 00:23:16,467
[SPEAKER_04]: You get Shadowgrounds.

312
00:23:16,487 --> 00:23:18,148
[SPEAKER_04]: You get Shadowground Survivor.

313
00:23:18,668 --> 00:23:22,449
[SPEAKER_04]: I think these other games were only with pre-order.

314
00:23:22,469 --> 00:23:23,549
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think you get them anymore.

315
00:23:24,025 --> 00:23:31,270
[SPEAKER_04]: you get the game Trauma now too I think it's thrown in there and the one other game I want to mention because this is the one I played, Trine was in the bundle as well

316
00:23:32,404 --> 00:23:34,186
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

317
00:23:55,748 --> 00:23:56,208
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

318
00:24:12,695 --> 00:24:35,427
[SPEAKER_04]: and you literally hit one button to switch between because like the story kind of goes that all three of them find this magical item that they get attached to because usually the thief and the warrior would not be getting along and the mage and the thief would be having this weird thing going on so you know the item binds them all together and so now their souls are all shared or whatever so they're going on this adventure to remedy that.

319
00:24:36,027 --> 00:24:39,129
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

320
00:24:59,444 --> 00:25:03,047
[SPEAKER_04]: For the low, low price of whatever, it's great.

321
00:25:03,968 --> 00:25:06,609
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, I would recommend you not be totally cheap.

322
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:10,753
[SPEAKER_04]: Spend the, let's just say, five bucks at least and get the other games as well.

323
00:25:10,793 --> 00:25:12,334
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you're having a good week, give them ten.

324
00:25:12,394 --> 00:25:13,034
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a good cause.

325
00:25:13,695 --> 00:25:16,677
[SPEAKER_04]: Or whatever you think these games are worth.

326
00:25:16,957 --> 00:25:35,994
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, that's at HumbleBundle.com And trying alone was worth it I gotta admit, I tried I was gifted a copy of Frozen Synapse about two weeks ago Because Steam was having like a buy one get one free sale Where like people could give the codes to other people And somebody was kind enough to give me their code for Frozen Synapse I gotta admit

327
00:25:36,714 --> 00:25:38,114
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't get it at all.

328
00:25:38,814 --> 00:25:40,395
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I just need to try again.

329
00:25:41,135 --> 00:25:42,695
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes you have to be in the right mindset.

330
00:25:42,975 --> 00:25:43,935
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you guys ever had that?

331
00:25:44,115 --> 00:25:46,436
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to just be in the right mindset to enjoy a game.

332
00:25:46,936 --> 00:25:49,216
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes you'll sit down and play it once and you're like, I don't get it.

333
00:25:49,656 --> 00:25:53,417
[SPEAKER_04]: But then you go back a month later and play it again and you're like, oh man, what was I missing?

334
00:25:53,457 --> 00:25:59,778
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I just wasn't in the right mindset, which is why I don't think I ever reviewed it on the show because I knew I wasn't really prepared to talk about it.

335
00:26:00,118 --> 00:26:02,079
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, did DarkSakura just buy the Humble Bundle?

336
00:26:02,339 --> 00:26:02,779
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it did.

337
00:26:03,079 --> 00:26:03,619
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

338
00:26:04,379 --> 00:26:06,021
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you'll like trying.

339
00:26:06,181 --> 00:26:10,825
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to buy this one because I haven't even played through more than one game out of the last bundle I bought.

340
00:26:10,865 --> 00:26:13,848
[SPEAKER_04]: But didn't you play VVVVVV until you beat it?

341
00:26:15,549 --> 00:26:26,519
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, until I beat it, but not 100% because I still have one more shiny object to get and I just want to rip my hair out if I'm supposed to get that.

342
00:26:28,021 --> 00:26:28,441
[SPEAKER_02]: It's annoying.

343
00:26:29,622 --> 00:26:30,262
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I get it.

344
00:26:30,362 --> 00:26:35,566
[SPEAKER_02]: It's supposed to be hard, but I don't want to play it anymore because it's so hard.

345
00:26:36,987 --> 00:26:40,049
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to come back to it and try it because I know what happens if I get it.

346
00:26:40,229 --> 00:26:41,950
[SPEAKER_02]: It just flips the damn game upside down.

347
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:42,390
[SPEAKER_02]: Spoiler.

348
00:26:42,871 --> 00:26:43,891
[SPEAKER_02]: And you play the same thing again.

349
00:26:44,211 --> 00:26:47,354
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's still the same fucking game because you flip up and down.

350
00:26:47,434 --> 00:26:48,534
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like Castlevania.

351
00:26:48,795 --> 00:26:54,758
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, but I get what you're saying, but up until you get to that point, it's an amazing game, and the music is amazing.

352
00:26:54,778 --> 00:26:55,779
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's an amazing game.

353
00:26:55,819 --> 00:26:56,119
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.

354
00:26:56,139 --> 00:26:57,180
[SPEAKER_04]: It's such a simple concept.

355
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:57,821
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just great.

356
00:26:59,362 --> 00:27:01,103
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean... I know, alright, alright.

357
00:27:01,824 --> 00:27:04,626
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, I think, you know, maybe... Loki, did you play Trine on 360?

358
00:27:05,287 --> 00:27:07,469
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I think a lot of people may have already played it and I just missed it.

359
00:27:07,489 --> 00:27:08,029
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't played it on 360.

360
00:27:08,129 --> 00:27:13,294
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say that alone makes this set worth it, but, you know, check it out.

361
00:27:13,354 --> 00:27:15,596
[SPEAKER_04]: Frozen Synapse, I think, is a bit more of like a strategy game.

362
00:27:15,796 --> 00:27:17,657
[SPEAKER_11]: Also comes with soundtracks and an editor.

363
00:27:18,438 --> 00:27:18,798
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, really?

364
00:27:18,838 --> 00:27:19,739
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't even pick that up.

365
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:21,801
[SPEAKER_04]: See, I just... You know what?

366
00:27:21,901 --> 00:27:24,183
[SPEAKER_04]: I just picked up my Steam code and went to town.

367
00:27:25,376 --> 00:27:26,376
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

368
00:27:50,147 --> 00:28:07,772
[SPEAKER_04]: it is a really good looking game and very smooth on my computer and I'm playing it in like 1680 by 1050 widescreen in high quality so it's great yeah actually Salacious Pop may not even know I didn't even have the graphics on their highest setting I had it on high not very high so maybe I'll have to try again later with a very high

369
00:28:08,652 --> 00:28:10,453
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyway, that's pretty much my gaming week.

370
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:16,198
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think we will move on to gaming news and talk about all that with you guys in our chat room.

371
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:21,022
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess I could quickly mention once again, please follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.

372
00:28:21,342 --> 00:28:24,264
[SPEAKER_04]: We also have a Facebook at facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

373
00:28:24,605 --> 00:28:29,288
[SPEAKER_04]: This is also the part of the show where I will mention any housekeeping, like upcoming shows that we're missing and what have you.

374
00:28:30,569 --> 00:28:31,850
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm stuck for the rest of the year.

375
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:33,832
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't see myself missing any shows.

376
00:28:33,892 --> 00:28:35,233
[SPEAKER_04]: Something unforeseen may always come up.

377
00:28:35,433 --> 00:28:36,474
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm missing one in a few weeks.

378
00:28:36,494 --> 00:28:39,819
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right, DarkSakura, you are leaving for a week at the end of the month, right?

379
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:41,721
[SPEAKER_11]: I will be gone on the 23rd.

380
00:28:41,921 --> 00:28:42,842
[SPEAKER_04]: But it won't affect the show.

381
00:28:42,882 --> 00:28:46,026
[SPEAKER_04]: We will have a guest host just like you guys had Dan here when I wasn't here.

382
00:28:46,627 --> 00:28:47,748
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll move on.

383
00:28:48,529 --> 00:28:49,431
[SPEAKER_04]: So, all right.

384
00:28:50,572 --> 00:28:51,633
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get into some gaming news.

385
00:28:51,713 --> 00:28:52,595
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, start us off.

386
00:28:52,635 --> 00:28:52,915
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up?

387
00:28:53,155 --> 00:29:02,119
[SPEAKER_02]: So, PlayStation 2 games, as we've kind of thought for a while, are going digital in this new Only on PlayStation Network campaign.

388
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:16,286
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to be doing, I guess every Tuesday this month, they're going to have a new exclusive selection of rare classic games, including God Hand, Grim Grimoire, Maximo and Odin Sphere, and Ring of Red.

389
00:29:19,588 --> 00:29:24,171
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess, of course, their old PlayStation 2 games, they've done nothing to them.

390
00:29:24,291 --> 00:29:25,872
[SPEAKER_02]: No updates whatsoever.

391
00:29:25,932 --> 00:29:28,393
[SPEAKER_02]: They just play now on the PlayStation 3.

392
00:29:29,614 --> 00:29:37,978
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess PlayStation Plus members get them at a 20% off discount during launch week.

393
00:29:39,079 --> 00:29:44,202
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you spend more than $60 in October, you'll get a $10 credit for November.

394
00:29:46,411 --> 00:29:48,893
[SPEAKER_02]: So, interesting.

395
00:29:49,033 --> 00:29:52,756
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess they're saying there's also a lineup of PlayStation Network exclusives.

396
00:29:52,956 --> 00:30:04,065
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, these aren't necessarily, these are actually not PlayStation 2 games, but Euphoria and Rock Hard, that was actually this week on the 4th.

397
00:30:04,706 --> 00:30:09,930
[SPEAKER_02]: Next week on the 11th, Sideway New York on the 13th, Sodium Collection.

398
00:30:11,572 --> 00:30:14,496
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's sodium, might as well forget about it.

399
00:30:14,776 --> 00:30:18,641
[SPEAKER_02]: 18th, Okabu and Rocket Birds.

400
00:30:19,042 --> 00:30:25,731
[SPEAKER_02]: And then on the 25th, the expansion for Infamous 2, Infamous Festival, Blood, and PixelJunk Side Scroller.

401
00:30:27,012 --> 00:30:30,013
[SPEAKER_02]: But all I got to say is, yeah, thanks, Sony.

402
00:30:30,273 --> 00:30:42,037
[SPEAKER_02]: You figured out a way to play PlayStation 2 games on your PS3 systems, but you don't do a free update for everybody so they can, I don't know, take their old games that they have and make everybody happy because they have backwards compatibility.

403
00:30:42,277 --> 00:30:44,218
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you decide to sell them on the marketplace.

404
00:30:45,038 --> 00:30:45,378
[SPEAKER_02]: Figures.

405
00:30:47,621 --> 00:30:47,981
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying

406
00:31:15,615 --> 00:31:16,676
[SPEAKER_02]: Have they emulated that?

407
00:31:46,155 --> 00:31:47,016
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, here's my other question.

408
00:31:47,056 --> 00:31:59,183
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, the whole benefit of the doubt thing is it may be a situation similar to Xbox 360 and original Xbox, or maybe their emulator doesn't emulate everything, and that's why they don't want to open it up, because maybe it can't play the big, big games.

409
00:31:59,543 --> 00:32:04,286
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I mean, you got a lot of neat games in this original launch here, but let's be real.

410
00:32:04,346 --> 00:32:08,468
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not like you have your Final Fantasy X, your Grand Theft Auto Vice City.

411
00:32:08,488 --> 00:32:09,929
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, they're doing... None of that is in there.

412
00:32:09,969 --> 00:32:12,911
[SPEAKER_02]: But see, they're doing just rare...

413
00:32:13,211 --> 00:32:13,772
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

414
00:32:47,213 --> 00:32:52,237
[SPEAKER_02]: It's because they lost a lot of money when the PlayStation Network went down and they need to recoup that.

415
00:32:52,838 --> 00:32:53,979
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why they're selling them.

416
00:32:54,019 --> 00:32:54,439
[SPEAKER_02]: You think?

417
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:56,000
[SPEAKER_02]: That is exactly why they're doing it.

418
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:59,023
[SPEAKER_04]: I did notice that there was very little fanfare about this.

419
00:32:59,103 --> 00:32:59,824
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?

420
00:33:00,204 --> 00:33:01,545
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been building up to this.

421
00:33:01,645 --> 00:33:06,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember about two years ago there were the whole rumors about the Dreamcast things are going to be coming?

422
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:07,330
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

423
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:08,190
[SPEAKER_02]: But those already have.

424
00:33:09,171 --> 00:33:09,251
[SPEAKER_04]: E3 E3

425
00:33:27,066 --> 00:33:28,627
[SPEAKER_04]: or even Tokyo Game Show about this.

426
00:33:28,667 --> 00:33:32,090
[SPEAKER_04]: But no, this just was like, no, yeah, we're going to just put these up in the marketplace.

427
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:32,310
[SPEAKER_04]: Enjoy.

428
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:41,196
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's why you're seeing a lot of these older games that are very niche and stuff because these companies aren't going to necessarily put out these HD remakes or whatever of their old games.

429
00:33:41,616 --> 00:33:45,939
[SPEAKER_02]: So obviously you're not going to find a Grand Theft Auto or something like that as part of this because...

430
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:52,884
[SPEAKER_02]: As we discussed last week, of course they're going to at some point up-res all the Grand Theft Auto games and put it out on a disc.

431
00:33:53,304 --> 00:33:56,046
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's just stupid if they don't.

432
00:33:56,266 --> 00:33:57,567
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, why wouldn't you?

433
00:33:57,587 --> 00:34:00,448
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially if San Andreas, it would be easy.

434
00:34:00,568 --> 00:34:02,990
[SPEAKER_02]: All you would have to do is re-license the music in there.

435
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:05,231
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, that would be a cost.

436
00:34:05,371 --> 00:34:11,035
[SPEAKER_02]: You wouldn't even necessarily have to re-record the audio in the game.

437
00:34:11,095 --> 00:34:14,117
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, you'd have to get the rights from all the voice actors and stuff like that.

438
00:34:14,637 --> 00:34:22,844
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, if you put in the Rage Engine or something like that, and they've already done that on the PC, modders have already taken care of that, it could be done.

439
00:34:23,504 --> 00:34:27,407
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just getting all the rights and all the legal stuff taken care of.

440
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:30,730
[SPEAKER_02]: But once they do that, I mean, it's just going to be amazing.

441
00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:34,053
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to our chat room for some comments at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

442
00:34:34,473 --> 00:34:34,793
[SPEAKER_04]: SSJ100Matt says,

443
00:34:39,897 --> 00:35:08,472
[SPEAKER_02]: YYR says maybe they're just doing software emulation wasn't there a Playstation 3 model that did that already although it didn't support every game I seem to remember that too wasn't it the Europe one or maybe they had one here too but wasn't there one overseas the old 80 gig systems that came out here a long time ago 80 and the 40 I think it was the 80 gig systems like the Metal Gear Solid one was one of the first ones that supported just some of the titles and not all of them like the one sitting in my front room

444
00:35:08,994 --> 00:35:34,763
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the 40 gig systems stopped supporting it And eventually the 80 gig systems also stopped supporting it But yeah, it is software emulation So is the PlayStation 1 games And in fact, the PlayStation 1 games You can take that emulator and basically dump any ISO into it And it'll work just fine That's what they've done on hacked PSPs Is they've taken that same emulator and you can run any PlayStation 1 game

445
00:35:35,363 --> 00:35:45,549
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'm guessing this is probably the same situation with the PlayStation 2 stuff is it's just an emulator that they have and they've found a way to just basically they can dump any ISO in there and done.

446
00:35:45,989 --> 00:35:46,609
[SPEAKER_02]: They're ready to go.

447
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:52,252
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know because I haven't really seen anybody try to hack it apart yet but I'm guessing that's probably what it is.

448
00:35:53,173 --> 00:35:54,854
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think they'll make a lot of money off this, Loki?

449
00:35:55,573 --> 00:35:56,314
[SPEAKER_02]: God Hand Clover Game

450
00:36:11,337 --> 00:36:13,738
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I gotta admit, there's some of those that I kind of want to check out too.

451
00:36:13,758 --> 00:36:17,661
[SPEAKER_04]: But thankfully, Alan has like a couple of these already.

452
00:36:17,761 --> 00:36:19,982
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's just like, oh, we just gotta hook up the PlayStation 2.

453
00:36:20,022 --> 00:36:26,185
[SPEAKER_02]: It's sad though that they aren't even trying to like update these at all.

454
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:30,307
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they're not even smoothing out the graphics or whatever that you would get.

455
00:36:30,508 --> 00:36:32,369
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you can do that with the PlayStation 3.

456
00:36:32,829 --> 00:36:36,771
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, shit, I haven't even tried to run a PlayStation 2 game on my 20 gig.

457
00:36:36,791 --> 00:36:37,331
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, 500 gig now.

458
00:36:40,713 --> 00:36:46,977
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you can do the smoothing stuff like kind of how you were able to with the PlayStation 2 on PlayStation 1 games.

459
00:36:47,417 --> 00:36:48,478
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a little bit better.

460
00:36:50,619 --> 00:36:51,620
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I mean, it's just...

461
00:36:53,576 --> 00:36:54,617
[SPEAKER_02]: and DarkSakura.com.

462
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:15,728
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell, you can't buy new copies of that anymore, so that might be a good way to drive sales.

463
00:37:15,769 --> 00:37:16,969
[SPEAKER_02]: And same with the PlayStation 1 games.

464
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:25,816
[SPEAKER_02]: PS3s are fully backwards compatible with PlayStation 1 games, and I'm pretty sure they sell a lot of PlayStation 1 games on their network, so I don't understand why they don't do it.

465
00:37:27,739 --> 00:37:29,300
[SPEAKER_11]: If I may rewind just a little bit.

466
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:29,960
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, of course.

467
00:37:31,001 --> 00:37:36,604
[SPEAKER_11]: The game Splot that was a pre-order win, they are including it when it's available.

468
00:37:37,364 --> 00:37:37,664
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, okay.

469
00:37:37,684 --> 00:37:38,645
[SPEAKER_11]: For the indie bundle.

470
00:37:38,925 --> 00:37:39,125
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice.

471
00:37:39,425 --> 00:37:40,546
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's a demo of it available.

472
00:37:40,846 --> 00:37:41,246
Woohoo!

473
00:37:42,267 --> 00:37:42,607
[SPEAKER_04]: Good to know.

474
00:37:43,826 --> 00:37:44,146
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

475
00:37:44,446 --> 00:37:45,867
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let's move on with some other news.

476
00:37:46,287 --> 00:37:52,888
[SPEAKER_04]: This is also about Sony and a comment that they have made this week, and it's about the Vita, which a lot of people are looking forward to.

477
00:37:52,928 --> 00:37:54,609
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've got to say, I'm one of them.

478
00:37:54,829 --> 00:37:56,409
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm definitely picking up a Vita at launch.

479
00:37:56,529 --> 00:37:58,049
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, you're getting one of these too, right?

480
00:37:58,149 --> 00:37:58,410
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.

481
00:37:59,390 --> 00:37:59,730
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.

482
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:02,030
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you sitting on the fence with right now?

483
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:05,471
[SPEAKER_04]: I know Dark Sakura has more financial stuff.

484
00:38:05,731 --> 00:38:06,391
[SPEAKER_04]: It's financial.

485
00:38:06,692 --> 00:38:06,892
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it?

486
00:38:06,972 --> 00:38:07,372
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

487
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:08,212
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

488
00:38:08,979 --> 00:38:11,100
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it is a financial investment, I guess, no matter how you look at it.

489
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:15,842
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I guess it's financial for me, too, but I have a real tendency to spend a lot of money on stupid crap.

490
00:38:15,942 --> 00:38:17,282
[SPEAKER_02]: The lineup is looking nice.

491
00:38:17,423 --> 00:38:20,424
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just we'll see what they have at launch.

492
00:38:21,284 --> 00:38:21,504
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

493
00:38:21,704 --> 00:38:27,727
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let's talk about a comment that John Kohler this week, who's the director of hardware marketing, mentioned in an interview with Investor Palace.

494
00:38:28,107 --> 00:38:28,347
[SPEAKER_04]: Quote,

495
00:38:37,731 --> 00:38:37,931
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, um...

496
00:39:03,843 --> 00:39:04,523
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know about that.

497
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:35,362
[SPEAKER_02]: and the fact that it's going to have still the touch sensor, you could pretty much, if you're a developer, you could port this stuff over to the PlayStation Suite or whatever and if it does end up turning out to be pretty viable, you could see a lot of stuff coming out of there and yeah, they could quickly catch up.

498
00:39:36,423 --> 00:39:39,545
[SPEAKER_02]: Beating out Apple right away, I don't know about that.

499
00:39:39,805 --> 00:39:44,629
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, because they're not going to sell more units than there are iPhones or iPods or whatever, iPads.

500
00:39:46,049 --> 00:39:47,390
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like they're two tablets.

501
00:39:47,450 --> 00:39:48,030
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, come on.

502
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:50,651
[SPEAKER_02]: Those things are terrible looking.

503
00:39:51,671 --> 00:39:57,833
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, come on.

504
00:39:57,853 --> 00:40:10,917
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm still looking forward to the Vita, and I think the intricacy of the games on here are not going to be able to... I mean, will be a step higher, certainly, than what you get on the iPhone and so forth, despite everything that iPhone showed this week.

505
00:40:12,738 --> 00:40:36,768
[SPEAKER_04]: but I think the other big thing that sets this apart is just the fact that it's designed as a gaming system first so therefore you have things like I don't know tangible buttons and sort of the features that gamers would want but of course this whole comment like this you know we're better than the mobile games and so forth I think just serves as justification for them to charge way more money for the games and how much weren't you saying the games were like 50 bucks on this thing right now

506
00:40:37,068 --> 00:40:38,550
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's what PSP games are.

507
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:39,871
[SPEAKER_04]: I couldn't remember.

508
00:40:39,891 --> 00:40:41,293
[SPEAKER_02]: I always thought PSP was $40.

509
00:40:41,473 --> 00:40:46,358
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, PSP games are $40 now, but they used to be $50.

510
00:40:46,478 --> 00:40:50,603
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's just now you're not seeing a lot of games sold on there.

511
00:40:50,963 --> 00:40:54,828
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, there's still $50 games on the PSP, and I think that's a great price point.

512
00:40:54,868 --> 00:40:58,352
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, assuming that stays there and doesn't go any higher, because...

513
00:40:59,773 --> 00:41:00,093
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

514
00:41:00,193 --> 00:41:01,654
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think they should be.

515
00:41:01,714 --> 00:41:08,518
[SPEAKER_02]: But I like the fact, though, that the system is going to be very much like the original PSP where it's a gaming system, but it does a lot of other shit.

516
00:41:09,259 --> 00:41:09,859
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, right.

517
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:15,803
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that will be probably ultimately its greatest strength as well is that it's a great college kid system.

518
00:41:16,484 --> 00:41:18,825
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's probably where the PSP sold a lot, too.

519
00:41:19,566 --> 00:41:20,166
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you go.

520
00:41:20,826 --> 00:41:22,968
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, DarkSakura, what do you got for us?

521
00:41:23,405 --> 00:41:50,739
[SPEAKER_11]: I have some stuff and it's more Sony yay basically they've implied that all the first party titles are going to use the online pass basically they're pulling an EA like the $10 deal so they're saying that Uncharted 3 is going to use the online pass system that was introduced earlier with Resistance 3 and saying that online pass will be incorporated into future Sony Computer Entertainment Worldwide Studios games with online functionality

522
00:41:52,282 --> 00:41:53,703
[SPEAKER_11]: They said they're going to announce more on it later.

523
00:41:54,463 --> 00:41:56,265
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, now a first party's on board.

524
00:41:56,305 --> 00:41:58,506
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's time to just accept that this is now the norm.

525
00:41:58,986 --> 00:41:59,206
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

526
00:41:59,426 --> 00:41:59,627
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?

527
00:41:59,907 --> 00:42:00,307
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty much.

528
00:42:01,067 --> 00:42:04,369
[SPEAKER_02]: There's still some people that are... I think you'll see a lot more third parties do it.

529
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:05,850
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not going to see Microsoft do it.

530
00:42:06,451 --> 00:42:06,871
[SPEAKER_02]: They can't.

531
00:42:07,011 --> 00:42:08,632
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that would just look bad.

532
00:42:08,672 --> 00:42:09,673
[SPEAKER_04]: Microsoft can't do it.

533
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:10,073
[SPEAKER_04]: You're right.

534
00:42:10,113 --> 00:42:10,873
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree with you there.

535
00:42:11,594 --> 00:42:13,915
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless they stop charging for gold, which they're not going to do.

536
00:42:14,275 --> 00:42:14,436
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

537
00:42:14,836 --> 00:42:14,976
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

538
00:42:15,416 --> 00:42:18,177
[SPEAKER_04]: So it would be very interesting if they try, though.

539
00:42:19,318 --> 00:42:20,578
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't wait for that episode.

540
00:42:21,018 --> 00:42:22,519
[SPEAKER_04]: And Nintendo, well, you know.

541
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:24,840
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't even know online exists.

542
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:25,560
[SPEAKER_02]: What online?

543
00:42:25,961 --> 00:42:26,641
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

544
00:42:26,901 --> 00:42:27,621
[SPEAKER_11]: That was funny.

545
00:42:27,641 --> 00:42:29,642
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like you have to charge for an online pass.

546
00:42:30,122 --> 00:42:30,342
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

547
00:42:30,523 --> 00:42:32,183
[SPEAKER_02]: There's online?

548
00:42:32,203 --> 00:42:34,464
[SPEAKER_04]: So we can maintain our online system.

549
00:42:34,764 --> 00:42:35,044
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

550
00:42:36,685 --> 00:42:37,425
[SPEAKER_04]: What online?

551
00:42:38,766 --> 00:42:39,767
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?

552
00:42:40,408 --> 00:42:46,173
[SPEAKER_04]: There's still a lot of question marks with the Wii U. Yeah, like what does it do?

553
00:42:46,753 --> 00:42:49,676
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, one of those huge question marks is how's it going to handle online?

554
00:42:49,696 --> 00:42:53,960
[SPEAKER_04]: And they have been purposefully quiet on it because I don't think they know either.

555
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,042
[SPEAKER_02]: But they better know by June.

556
00:42:56,742 --> 00:42:58,104
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, crap.

557
00:42:58,944 --> 00:43:00,506
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to do online as well?

558
00:43:01,386 --> 00:43:03,568
[SPEAKER_02]: Our online system will be significant.

559
00:43:04,629 --> 00:43:05,951
[SPEAKER_11]: Significantly bad.

560
00:43:06,391 --> 00:43:15,459
[SPEAKER_04]: I told you at E3, right, when they brought the EA guy out on stage, I thought he was going to come out to announce that EA was going to just do the online part of the Wii.

561
00:43:15,499 --> 00:43:23,125
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they were talking about a partnership and stuff, and they mentioned online games and stuff, and I thought, oh, they're just going to let EA handle the online part of the Wii.

562
00:43:23,466 --> 00:43:24,166
[SPEAKER_04]: That'll be what it is.

563
00:43:24,787 --> 00:43:25,648
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that wasn't what it is.

564
00:43:26,408 --> 00:43:27,769
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be terrible if they did that.

565
00:43:28,390 --> 00:43:29,411
[SPEAKER_11]: And that would be sad.

566
00:43:31,249 --> 00:43:32,369
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, moving on, Loki.

567
00:43:33,730 --> 00:43:35,430
[SPEAKER_02]: So, it's kind of cool.

568
00:43:35,710 --> 00:43:50,514
[SPEAKER_02]: During the same time as the whole Apple unveil of their new technology devices and stuff like that, there was this whole Flash Adobe conference, Adobe Max conference going on.

569
00:43:51,194 --> 00:43:53,655
[SPEAKER_02]: and some of the new things that they're showing.

570
00:43:53,995 --> 00:43:58,676
[SPEAKER_02]: First off, Unreal Engine support for Flash 11, which is kind of interesting.

571
00:43:58,816 --> 00:44:07,838
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to actually have some really decent looking games now running in the Flash or even in your own web browser, so that's kind of cool.

572
00:44:09,279 --> 00:44:13,800
[SPEAKER_02]: People are saying, hey, maybe this could be a major transition in social gaming.

573
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:15,180
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it won't.

574
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:17,521
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm afraid that's not going to be the case because

575
00:44:18,081 --> 00:44:18,842
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

576
00:44:19,182 --> 00:44:30,387
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, the technology may be out there to do that, but it doesn't necessarily mean that a company is going to do that, seeing as they can develop a game much cheaper that doesn't necessarily need the Unreal 3 engine.

577
00:44:30,928 --> 00:44:38,051
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's neat to see that, hey, someday we may be playing Unreal Tournament in our web browser.

578
00:44:40,953 --> 00:44:57,879
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, of course, not to be outdone by that, Crytek also is investigating Flash for the CryEngine and possibly doing some sort of cross-platform solution, including support with a bunch of other systems.

579
00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:00,360
[SPEAKER_02]: They're even saying maybe looking into iOS and Android.

580
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:01,001
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be kind of cool.

581
00:45:01,421 --> 00:45:06,063
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if that'd be able to... Obviously, not some of the phones out there like mine, but...

582
00:45:08,752 --> 00:45:09,312
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool.

583
00:45:09,513 --> 00:45:13,595
[SPEAKER_02]: And, of course, they're saying Crytek Seal is hard to work at.

584
00:45:13,935 --> 00:45:18,578
[SPEAKER_02]: The first-person shooter, Warface, which is supposed to be coming out in Asian regions.

585
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:21,820
[SPEAKER_02]: But it might be pretty cool.

586
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:35,288
[SPEAKER_02]: If they do some sort of easy cross-platform solution, you may see a lot of these PC games being ported to many other devices other than just Xbox 360 and PS3 in the near future.

587
00:45:35,648 --> 00:45:35,828
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

588
00:45:36,949 --> 00:45:37,590
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.

589
00:45:37,970 --> 00:45:45,358
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be interesting to see if web browsers actually get enough technology where they can support really good looking games.

590
00:45:45,819 --> 00:45:48,742
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be kind of interesting because then you wouldn't necessarily need

591
00:45:50,549 --> 00:45:50,929
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

592
00:46:15,325 --> 00:46:22,027
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if that would be... See, the problem is... I just shot my friend DarkSakura in the face.

593
00:46:22,527 --> 00:46:25,848
[SPEAKER_04]: Click here to post to your wall and try Unreal Gaming now.

594
00:46:25,888 --> 00:46:31,209
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem with that, though, is I just don't see them doing a casual game like that.

595
00:46:31,229 --> 00:46:39,971
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, once again, Facebook kind of tends to skew towards casual gamers, and I don't really see Unreal Tournament...

596
00:46:40,231 --> 00:46:41,512
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

597
00:47:02,192 --> 00:47:06,435
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was surprised to see the Powered by Unreal Technology logo at the beginning.

598
00:47:06,575 --> 00:47:13,220
[SPEAKER_04]: I realize the new game is, but I was like, well, what the hell about the classic emulation needs the fucking Unreal Engine?

599
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:13,980
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, really?

600
00:47:15,001 --> 00:47:20,524
[SPEAKER_04]: The only thing I could possibly think of are the little, like, rotating images of the arcade cabinets.

601
00:47:21,165 --> 00:47:21,985
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, what?! !

602
00:47:23,306 --> 00:47:41,453
[SPEAKER_04]: or maybe there's some maybe I just haven't seen it yet maybe there's like an unlockable demo for the new one or something that shows up but I was kind of surprised to see that I was like okay I know Mortal Kombat 3 and 2 and 1 did not run on the Unreal Engine no I'm pretty sure they did not this is funny to me so

603
00:47:43,183 --> 00:47:56,592
[SPEAKER_02]: Although, if they somehow enabled it to where they took the old mo-cap stuff and made it into actual 3D models with the mo-cap likenesses and stuff, it'd be very interesting to see something like that.

604
00:47:56,612 --> 00:48:01,795
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, oh, hey, look, it's classic Mortal Kombat, but we can turn it in any direction, and it's 3D.

605
00:48:02,056 --> 00:48:02,636
Oh, my God.

606
00:48:02,976 --> 00:48:04,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Some might pay for that.

607
00:48:04,397 --> 00:48:08,960
[SPEAKER_04]: Tigerclaw in our chatroom at chat.orange.com says, an Unreal web-based game is possible.

608
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:10,741
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at Quake Live, for example.

609
00:48:11,162 --> 00:48:11,922
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there's a good example.

610
00:48:11,962 --> 00:48:12,943
[SPEAKER_04]: Quake Live is a good time.

611
00:48:14,645 --> 00:48:17,268
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I'd like to see more stuff like that, certainly.

612
00:48:17,288 --> 00:48:18,449
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be very interesting.

613
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:31,503
[SPEAKER_04]: It would also be interesting to see what MMOs, you know, that's another big thing that web browsers are used for, some of those like free MMOs, and although the quality of some of those is questionable, you know, this could take a lot of that to the next level.

614
00:48:31,523 --> 00:48:32,664
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be interesting to see what happens.

615
00:48:33,125 --> 00:48:33,906
[SPEAKER_02]: Dear Square Enix,

616
00:48:35,293 --> 00:48:37,476
[SPEAKER_02]: Final Fantasy XIV Last Revenant

617
00:48:56,664 --> 00:49:00,988
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I remember that because I think Alan bought it or he had it or played it or something.

618
00:49:01,709 --> 00:49:03,010
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought there was another... No!

619
00:49:03,090 --> 00:49:06,373
[SPEAKER_04]: Final Fantasy XIII uses Unreal.

620
00:49:07,074 --> 00:49:07,394
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, really?

621
00:49:07,614 --> 00:49:08,255
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it does.

622
00:49:08,675 --> 00:49:08,875
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

623
00:49:12,915 --> 00:49:13,555
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I miss?

624
00:49:14,036 --> 00:49:15,056
[SPEAKER_02]: That game of the Bouncer.

625
00:49:15,197 --> 00:49:16,157
[SPEAKER_02]: That was pretty cool.

626
00:49:17,098 --> 00:49:17,298
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

627
00:49:17,318 --> 00:49:18,078
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you talking about?

628
00:49:18,098 --> 00:49:19,960
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember the Square Enix game, The Bouncer?

629
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:21,120
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember that game.

630
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:21,641
[SPEAKER_02]: Their brawler.

631
00:49:21,981 --> 00:49:27,885
[SPEAKER_04]: I do... I remember a brawler called Ergeis, but I don't remember... Oh, Ergeis was awesome.

632
00:49:28,165 --> 00:49:30,086
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a game they need a sequel for right there.

633
00:49:30,326 --> 00:49:32,848
[SPEAKER_11]: The Bouncer was an early PS2 title.

634
00:49:33,268 --> 00:49:34,509
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and it was actually pretty awesome.

635
00:49:34,789 --> 00:49:38,232
[SPEAKER_11]: Where they all looked like Final Fantasy X characters, except they worked in a bar.

636
00:49:40,573 --> 00:49:41,114
[SPEAKER_02]: As bouncers.

637
00:49:41,294 --> 00:49:41,754
[SPEAKER_11]: As bouncers.

638
00:49:43,976 --> 00:49:44,596
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a weird game.

639
00:50:12,521 --> 00:50:14,223
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it looks hot.

640
00:50:14,603 --> 00:50:15,444
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks very hot.

641
00:50:15,824 --> 00:50:18,606
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Final Fantasy, but I have no idea why it's 13.

642
00:50:18,746 --> 00:50:22,570
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it's set in the same universe or whatever, but I didn't see any of the characters.

643
00:50:22,590 --> 00:50:22,870
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really.

644
00:50:22,910 --> 00:50:28,515
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was supposed to be more of a real... Yeah, I don't know what the hell it has to do with 13, but whatever.

645
00:50:28,535 --> 00:50:30,877
[SPEAKER_04]: There'll probably be some obscure little thing when you actually play the game.

646
00:50:30,897 --> 00:50:35,601
[SPEAKER_04]: But dude, the action, the battles kind of look like Kingdom Hearts, but with the hit points showing up on the screen.

647
00:50:35,621 --> 00:50:37,002
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, obviously it's done by the Kingdom Hearts team.

648
00:50:37,302 --> 00:50:38,323
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks sweet, actually.

649
00:50:39,484 --> 00:50:45,650
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to do an awesome radio moment here and I'm going to pull up the trailer here in studio and I'll post this in chat so you guys can see this too.

650
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:54,118
[SPEAKER_04]: For those of you that are on the podcast feed, I'll have DarkSakura posted to our Tumblr at orangeloungeradio.tumblr.com.

651
00:50:58,075 --> 00:50:59,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you not an IRC, DarkSakura?

652
00:50:59,636 --> 00:51:00,497
[SPEAKER_11]: I am an IRC.

653
00:51:00,597 --> 00:51:00,717
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh.

654
00:51:01,297 --> 00:51:03,679
[SPEAKER_11]: I meant, like, privately, so I can copy the URL.

655
00:51:03,799 --> 00:51:05,100
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, I will, I will.

656
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:07,222
[SPEAKER_04]: As soon as I pull it up here, because I can't remember.

657
00:51:07,262 --> 00:51:07,682
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this it?

658
00:51:07,782 --> 00:51:08,803
[SPEAKER_04]: No, this isn't the right one.

659
00:51:09,583 --> 00:51:11,144
[SPEAKER_04]: Where did I see that trailer?

660
00:51:13,426 --> 00:51:14,647
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody in chat will probably...

661
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:17,321
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello, Tigerclaw.

662
00:51:19,362 --> 00:51:19,722
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?

663
00:51:20,302 --> 00:51:21,843
[SPEAKER_04]: Tigerclaw should have posted it by now.

664
00:51:22,343 --> 00:51:23,424
[SPEAKER_04]: Gameplay trailer.

665
00:51:23,484 --> 00:51:24,885
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe it's this.

666
00:51:24,905 --> 00:51:25,565
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's Eidos.

667
00:51:25,585 --> 00:51:26,706
[SPEAKER_04]: That's Deus Ex.

668
00:51:27,987 --> 00:51:29,207
[SPEAKER_04]: Who the hell posted this?

669
00:51:29,448 --> 00:51:30,528
[SPEAKER_04]: And I watched it the other day.

670
00:51:30,548 --> 00:51:32,229
[SPEAKER_04]: I think somebody had posted it on Facebook.

671
00:51:33,630 --> 00:51:34,991
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, so in other news.

672
00:51:35,471 --> 00:51:36,432
[SPEAKER_11]: No, kidding.

673
00:51:37,072 --> 00:51:38,313
[SPEAKER_11]: I have made fantastic nut bread.

674
00:51:40,034 --> 00:51:40,954
[SPEAKER_04]: It was quite delicious.

675
00:51:41,274 --> 00:51:42,195
[SPEAKER_11]: It has no flour.

676
00:51:43,891 --> 00:51:44,731
[SPEAKER_11]: I made it with no flour.

677
00:51:44,811 --> 00:51:45,711
[SPEAKER_11]: It's made with almond meal.

678
00:51:45,751 --> 00:51:48,192
[SPEAKER_02]: Good luck trying to find anything on the new Facebook, by the way.

679
00:51:50,592 --> 00:51:55,093
[SPEAKER_02]: Your mission, if you choose to accept it, find something on Facebook.

680
00:51:55,113 --> 00:51:57,614
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a plug-in for Chrome that makes it run like the old version.

681
00:51:58,374 --> 00:51:58,654
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

682
00:51:58,954 --> 00:52:00,475
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem is I don't want to use Chrome.

683
00:52:01,935 --> 00:52:02,475
[SPEAKER_02]: But, yeah.

684
00:52:04,155 --> 00:52:04,416
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

685
00:52:04,476 --> 00:52:04,816
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

686
00:52:04,836 --> 00:52:06,276
[SPEAKER_02]: They did have The Last Remnant on PC.

687
00:52:08,547 --> 00:52:10,908
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, well, Rob's looking that up.

688
00:52:11,969 --> 00:52:14,190
[SPEAKER_04]: I found one, but it's not the right one.

689
00:52:14,210 --> 00:52:15,371
[SPEAKER_04]: They did like a flip of it.

690
00:52:15,431 --> 00:52:21,033
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to see if I can find the... Holy crap.

691
00:52:21,053 --> 00:52:23,935
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to see if I can find the actual gameplay parts.

692
00:52:28,547 --> 00:52:30,468
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wait, this was uploaded in, like, 2009.

693
00:52:30,848 --> 00:52:31,708
[SPEAKER_04]: This isn't even right.

694
00:52:31,768 --> 00:52:32,829
[SPEAKER_04]: Gosh, darn it.

695
00:52:33,689 --> 00:52:36,430
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody's... I've got to... Tiger Claw, find it for us.

696
00:52:38,131 --> 00:52:39,571
[SPEAKER_04]: I will keep looking for it.

697
00:52:40,612 --> 00:52:41,412
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, guys.

698
00:52:41,772 --> 00:52:43,593
[SPEAKER_04]: Terrible radio, but I know I saw it.

699
00:52:44,193 --> 00:52:44,493
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

700
00:52:46,534 --> 00:52:47,494
[SPEAKER_04]: Shoot, the next story's mine.

701
00:52:47,534 --> 00:52:49,075
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't look for it while I talk about this story.

702
00:52:49,095 --> 00:52:52,496
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll get through this quickly, although maybe not, because this is actually pretty big news.

703
00:52:53,977 --> 00:52:58,279
[SPEAKER_04]: Microsoft has talked a little bit this week about some of the TV updates for the Xbox 360.

704
00:52:58,719 --> 00:53:01,160
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we knew after E3 that they were going to be doing this.

705
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:03,241
[SPEAKER_04]: They were going to be bringing more television to the 360.

706
00:53:04,261 --> 00:53:05,822
[SPEAKER_04]: But we didn't really know how.

707
00:53:06,302 --> 00:53:14,206
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it turns out they've announced some partnerships and some of those include HBO and HBO Go, Comcast, Syfy, and Verizon.

708
00:53:14,246 --> 00:53:18,028
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess there was like an earlier list that had leaked and it turns out a lot of that seems to be correct.

709
00:53:18,728 --> 00:53:23,572
[SPEAKER_04]: They did publish a full list of the partners that will be in the fall dashboard update.

710
00:53:24,052 --> 00:53:30,716
[SPEAKER_04]: Comcast went so far as to make a blog post talking about using the partnership with Microsoft to offer Xfinity content.

711
00:53:31,037 --> 00:53:37,241
[SPEAKER_04]: So it sounds like, and this is of direct relevance to me because I have Comcast at home living where I live.

712
00:53:38,001 --> 00:53:43,625
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like that you will be able to use the on-demand system in Comcast.

713
00:53:44,065 --> 00:53:47,467
[SPEAKER_04]: You can use that in the 360 now.

714
00:53:50,048 --> 00:53:51,069
[SPEAKER_02]: But see, that's the thing.

715
00:53:51,109 --> 00:53:55,690
[SPEAKER_02]: I was hoping it would be more original stuff and not necessarily just everything that's on demand.

716
00:53:55,990 --> 00:54:01,631
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if I want to watch on demand, I can hit one button on my remote and I get on demand content.

717
00:54:01,791 --> 00:54:13,414
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't need to necessarily... Unless you're able to take your console to a friend's house or something like that and then you can access all your on demand content that way.

718
00:54:14,514 --> 00:54:14,814
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

719
00:54:15,215 --> 00:54:17,617
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just hoping for more original stuff.

720
00:54:17,697 --> 00:54:21,420
[SPEAKER_02]: Like an alternative than me having to have cable, you know what I mean?

721
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:24,862
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's already a bajillion alternatives out there anyway.

722
00:54:26,083 --> 00:54:29,146
[SPEAKER_11]: So I mean, this is just adding to the pile.

723
00:54:30,948 --> 00:54:42,437
[SPEAKER_04]: So what I'm also curious of is that if they're announcing all these other partnerships, the weird thing is though, doesn't HBO want to charge you $10 for their service and then these other... Well, HBO I don't think you can access unless you have HBO.

724
00:54:42,477 --> 00:54:45,380
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like how Xfinity and stuff.

725
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:48,582
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't access HBO on demand stuff unless you have HBO.

726
00:54:48,642 --> 00:54:49,023
[SPEAKER_04]: I get it.

727
00:54:49,043 --> 00:54:51,505
[SPEAKER_04]: And isn't it the same with like the mobile app?

728
00:54:51,545 --> 00:54:55,168
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you can't access mobile CNN video unless you have like Comcast or something?

729
00:54:55,188 --> 00:54:59,351
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, see, so that's why I was just kind of like, eh, don't really care.

730
00:54:59,491 --> 00:55:00,192
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, because...

731
00:55:00,612 --> 00:55:09,698
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I gotta say, though, I do like the idea that, you know, because the HBO stuff isn't on Netflix and it's not really on demand either, I like that it'll kind of be all in one place.

732
00:55:10,299 --> 00:55:20,146
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I get what you're saying with the one button on the remote, but, you know, if the Xbox 360 is gonna be this all-in-one entertainment device, it'd be nice to... If you can DVR stuff, that'd be pretty awesome, because then that way I don't have to pay for DVR.

733
00:55:22,147 --> 00:55:24,128
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that's gonna happen, but, you know...

734
00:55:25,790 --> 00:55:32,534
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, it looks like AT&T U-Verse is going to require Xbox Live Gold starting in November.

735
00:55:32,614 --> 00:55:38,679
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a note that was sent by the AT&T folks to their customers, which I'm assuming is lining it up with everything else here, right?

736
00:55:38,699 --> 00:55:41,360
[SPEAKER_02]: The TV service will actually require Xbox Live Gold.

737
00:55:42,501 --> 00:55:43,002
[SPEAKER_02]: All of them.

738
00:55:44,082 --> 00:55:53,489
[SPEAKER_02]: But before their boxes or whatever through AT&T U-Verse, because some of them still already have that, they do not require gold.

739
00:55:55,043 --> 00:55:56,324
[SPEAKER_04]: But they will now come November.

740
00:55:56,504 --> 00:55:56,745
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

741
00:55:57,285 --> 00:55:58,806
[SPEAKER_04]: That might make some people a little bit upset.

742
00:56:01,308 --> 00:56:02,910
[SPEAKER_02]: But not AT&T customers though.

743
00:56:04,311 --> 00:56:04,491
[SPEAKER_09]: Nope.

744
00:56:05,071 --> 00:56:06,773
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they're giving them a $60 credit.

745
00:56:07,473 --> 00:56:07,694
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

746
00:56:08,114 --> 00:56:15,160
[SPEAKER_04]: So yes, they give a $60 credit to existing AT&T U-verse customers for Xbox 360 customers.

747
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:16,821
[SPEAKER_04]: Now is that each year or just one year?

748
00:56:16,921 --> 00:56:18,382
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's just one time probably.

749
00:56:19,123 --> 00:56:20,124
[SPEAKER_11]: That would make sense.

750
00:56:20,663 --> 00:56:20,863
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

751
00:56:21,423 --> 00:56:23,385
[SPEAKER_04]: I want Comcast to give me 60 buck credit.

752
00:56:24,225 --> 00:56:25,366
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so who found this?

753
00:56:25,406 --> 00:56:26,066
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki found this.

754
00:56:26,186 --> 00:56:28,027
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you find this with somebody's help in chat?

755
00:56:28,207 --> 00:56:31,269
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope, I searched Final Fantasy XIII versus sort by date.

756
00:56:31,830 --> 00:56:32,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, good job.

757
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:35,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's what the gameplay looks like in the game.

758
00:56:37,990 --> 00:56:41,751
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can kind of see there's some, like, little live-action things that happen.

759
00:56:41,791 --> 00:56:47,033
[SPEAKER_04]: But definitely the walking around still kind of looks XIII-ish, but there's, like, a lot of lifestyle.

760
00:56:47,053 --> 00:56:47,613
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's some battle.

761
00:56:47,713 --> 00:56:48,633
[SPEAKER_04]: What's he doing in New York?

762
00:56:48,653 --> 00:56:49,153
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?

763
00:56:49,273 --> 00:56:53,054
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of Kingdom Hearts-ish, but with that very Final Fantasy VII, er, VII slash XIII environment, you know what I mean?

764
00:56:53,075 --> 00:56:53,975
[SPEAKER_03]: The swirly bits look like XII.

765
00:57:06,140 --> 00:57:07,262
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I can see that.

766
00:57:07,502 --> 00:57:09,104
[SPEAKER_04]: I can see a little bit of 12 here, too.

767
00:57:09,785 --> 00:57:11,187
[SPEAKER_04]: But I like this, too.

768
00:57:11,247 --> 00:57:16,295
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you notice those little pictures in the corner of the people are actually live rendering what the people are doing?

769
00:57:16,315 --> 00:57:17,456
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty cool.

770
00:57:18,478 --> 00:57:19,159
[SPEAKER_04]: Here, watch here.

771
00:57:19,179 --> 00:57:19,299
[SPEAKER_04]: See?

772
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:20,580
[SPEAKER_10]: That's cool.

773
00:57:20,881 --> 00:57:21,762
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's awesome.

774
00:57:21,782 --> 00:57:22,923
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not just a static picture.

775
00:57:22,963 --> 00:57:24,124
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like what they're doing.

776
00:57:24,144 --> 00:57:29,929
[SPEAKER_11]: That's like that add-on I use in the manual.

777
00:57:29,949 --> 00:57:30,650
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like X-Pearl.

778
00:57:30,710 --> 00:57:31,730
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's X-Pearl.

779
00:57:33,152 --> 00:57:34,333
[SPEAKER_11]: Final Fantasy X-Pearl.

780
00:57:34,553 --> 00:57:34,993
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you go.

781
00:57:35,013 --> 00:57:36,635
[SPEAKER_04]: There's what your Final Fantasy looks like.

782
00:57:36,695 --> 00:57:37,155
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that Cloud?

783
00:57:37,175 --> 00:57:40,098
[SPEAKER_11]: I know, it looks just like Cloud, doesn't it?

784
00:57:40,118 --> 00:57:41,119
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Cloud with a gun.

785
00:57:41,279 --> 00:57:43,141
[SPEAKER_11]: Send me that and I'll put it on our Tumblr.

786
00:57:44,742 --> 00:57:45,562
[SPEAKER_11]: Our tumble bubble.

787
00:57:45,602 --> 00:57:49,764
[SPEAKER_04]: There it is for the chatters, because I know us watching trailers isn't always the best radio, but there you go.

788
00:57:49,804 --> 00:57:51,824
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you have a place you can go look it up if you haven't already seen it.

789
00:57:52,965 --> 00:57:56,146
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I guess let's move on with some other gaming news.

790
00:57:56,586 --> 00:57:56,926
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.

791
00:57:56,946 --> 00:57:58,467
[SPEAKER_11]: Complete with an ad by Queen Latifah.

792
00:58:00,127 --> 00:58:03,308
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, DarkSakura, I got to distract you from the trailer to do your next story.

793
00:58:03,368 --> 00:58:05,489
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, how about some Skyward Sword characters?

794
00:58:06,649 --> 00:58:11,031
[SPEAKER_11]: There's actually a few spoilers, and you'll hear it here first.

795
00:58:13,941 --> 00:58:18,823
[SPEAKER_11]: Link and Zelda are childhood friends and have a special bond.

796
00:58:19,864 --> 00:58:24,546
[SPEAKER_11]: There is a bully at Link's school named Groose, G-R-O-O-S-E.

797
00:58:25,746 --> 00:58:30,408
[SPEAKER_11]: And there is a person named Fi, who is the spirit.

798
00:58:30,428 --> 00:58:31,609
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't worry, Link, it gets better.

799
00:58:32,129 --> 00:58:40,935
[SPEAKER_11]: Spirit of the Goddess Sword, and there's Gaepora, G-A-E-P-O-R-A, or is it Gaepora?

800
00:58:41,395 --> 00:58:44,818
[SPEAKER_11]: Who is Zelda's father and the headmaster of Link's school.

801
00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:50,041
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's another place in the game called Farron Woods.

802
00:58:50,782 --> 00:58:53,804
[SPEAKER_11]: Ooh, and you start off the game in a place called Skyloft.

803
00:58:54,925 --> 00:58:58,788
[SPEAKER_11]: And you can go to Skyview Temple where Zelda was kidnapped and is being held.

804
00:58:59,289 --> 00:58:59,609
[SPEAKER_11]: Again.

805
00:59:00,430 --> 00:59:01,190
[SPEAKER_11]: Yay.

806
00:59:02,151 --> 00:59:07,937
[SPEAKER_11]: As far as attacks that are in there, there's holding down the A button makes Link run faster and gives him acrobatic abilities.

807
00:59:08,397 --> 00:59:09,558
[SPEAKER_11]: He can run up walls.

808
00:59:10,699 --> 00:59:14,102
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess like he's Spider-Man or some shit.

809
00:59:14,523 --> 00:59:15,724
[SPEAKER_04]: Or the fucking Prince of Persia.

810
00:59:16,064 --> 00:59:22,546
[SPEAKER_11]: He can grab onto cliffs, but that uses Link's stamina, but you can replenish his stamina over time.

811
00:59:22,626 --> 00:59:29,088
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a spin attack that gives you stamina, and when your stamina is depleted, you go slowly.

812
00:59:29,208 --> 00:59:30,688
[SPEAKER_11]: You become Old Man Link.

813
00:59:32,509 --> 00:59:33,569
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's all I'm going to talk about it.

814
00:59:34,689 --> 00:59:36,930
[SPEAKER_11]: Although, there is one interesting thing that's in there.

815
00:59:37,070 --> 00:59:37,730
[SPEAKER_11]: You can douse.

816
00:59:40,215 --> 00:59:41,776
[SPEAKER_11]: Link in High School Saved by the Triforce

817
01:00:05,954 --> 01:00:33,216
[SPEAKER_11]: but anyway yes Tiffany Amber Thiessen will be playing the part of Zelda but for dowsing basically you hold out the sword and point it in the direction of the target and it will flash so basically it's to lead you in the right direction it's kind of what Shadow of the Colossus did it first so Bugs Bunny did it back in the you know in the 40s Simpsons did it I'm done

818
01:00:33,706 --> 01:00:34,447
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so excited!

819
01:00:34,667 --> 01:00:35,287
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so excited!

820
01:00:35,347 --> 01:00:36,328
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so scared!

821
01:00:36,468 --> 01:00:38,670
[SPEAKER_04]: You know I never watched that show for a reason.

822
01:01:07,899 --> 01:01:10,261
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the infamous caffeine pills episode.

823
01:01:10,301 --> 01:01:11,542
[SPEAKER_04]: Jesse was addicted to caffeine pills.

824
01:01:11,602 --> 01:01:17,746
[SPEAKER_11]: I understand, but I never watched that show because I can't watch a show with people acting stupid.

825
01:01:18,787 --> 01:01:20,048
[SPEAKER_11]: Seriously, that's why I don't watch Seinfeld.

826
01:01:20,068 --> 01:01:22,090
[SPEAKER_11]: But yet you went with us to watch Showgirls.

827
01:01:22,810 --> 01:01:23,911
[SPEAKER_11]: Because that's different.

828
01:01:23,931 --> 01:01:25,552
[SPEAKER_11]: They weren't being stupid to be funny.

829
01:01:26,793 --> 01:01:28,755
[SPEAKER_11]: It was funny without trying to be funny.

830
01:01:29,437 --> 01:01:33,942
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's travel around the world and check out what's going to be coming to a game store near you.

831
01:01:34,723 --> 01:01:36,324
[SPEAKER_04]: Saved by the Bell Collection on Blu-ray, maybe?

832
01:01:37,005 --> 01:01:37,325
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

833
01:01:37,425 --> 01:01:38,827
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not a game.

834
01:01:39,948 --> 01:01:40,669
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank God.

835
01:01:40,689 --> 01:01:42,150
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be terrible.

836
01:01:42,391 --> 01:01:44,533
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything Saved by the Bell the game would be terrible.

837
01:01:46,195 --> 01:01:46,896
[SPEAKER_02]: Dead Rising 2 Dead Rising 2

838
01:02:07,152 --> 01:02:16,221
[SPEAKER_02]: Forza Motorsports 4 coming out this week on Xbox 360, both the regular and limited edition as well.

839
01:02:17,442 --> 01:02:26,592
[SPEAKER_02]: Some other things you can look forward to, Power Up Heroes, that is kind of a superhero connect game that's coming out.

840
01:02:27,092 --> 01:02:28,893
[SPEAKER_02]: Red Dead Redemption Game of the Year Edition.

841
01:02:29,133 --> 01:02:31,795
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely a good buy if you haven't picked it up yet.

842
01:02:32,455 --> 01:02:35,817
[SPEAKER_02]: Both the regular and Undead Nightmare stuff plus all the download content for $50.

843
01:02:36,618 --> 01:02:38,679
[SPEAKER_02]: That's on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

844
01:02:39,079 --> 01:02:41,901
[SPEAKER_02]: Never come in the PC according to Rockstar Games.

01:04:29,292 --> 01:04:29,852
[SPEAKER_02]: They did that.

855
01:04:29,972 --> 01:04:30,853
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's weird.

856
01:04:30,973 --> 01:04:32,734
[SPEAKER_11]: The last rugby game that came out... People like rugby?

857
01:04:33,515 --> 01:04:38,158
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand that, but people don't like GameStop, and I don't want to go there to get my rugby game.

01:04:39,079 --> 01:04:39,819
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, let's be real.

861

[SPEAKER_04]: Yet nobody has explained to me what the fucking connection between GameStop and rugby is.

862
01:04:51,553 --> 01:04:52,213
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no clue.

863
01:04:52,653 --> 01:04:53,074

865
01:05:11,341 --> 01:05:14,322
[SPEAKER_02]: And for the new listeners, why do you want this game to fail?

866
01:05:14,562 --> 01:05:15,162
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

867
01:05:31,227 --> 01:05:31,907
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

868
01:05:51,756 --> 01:06:01,020
[SPEAKER_02]: so that they can get on their top Hot 15 Toys list, which they did, and they have an exclusive pack over at Toys R Us, a three pack of their figures.

869
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:06,843
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because that Hot Games list, yeah, that's not manipulated at all to get people to buy shit.

870
01:06:07,203 --> 01:06:07,403
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

871
01:06:08,263 --> 01:06:09,324
[SPEAKER_02]: So, hope it tanks.

872
01:06:10,544 --> 01:06:12,545
[SPEAKER_04]: So don't follow the Hot Games list.

873
01:06:13,291 --> 01:06:14,372
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, don't follow it.

874
01:06:14,552 --> 01:06:15,293
[SPEAKER_02]: It's rigged.

875
01:06:15,373 --> 01:06:16,513
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not Spyro.

876
01:06:16,573 --> 01:06:19,415
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, Spyro, it's not what it used to be.

877
01:06:19,616 --> 01:06:21,997
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like us getting nominated for a podcast award.

878
01:06:22,017 --> 01:06:22,738
[SPEAKER_04]: Shenanigans.

879
01:06:25,313 --> 01:06:26,574
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, it's really not worth it.

880
01:06:26,594 --> 01:06:30,778
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, seriously, it's $70 to buy this game on a 3DS.

881
01:06:31,478 --> 01:06:33,680
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, it's $70 for the 3DS.

882
01:06:33,740 --> 01:06:34,561
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god.

883
01:06:34,941 --> 01:06:37,543
[SPEAKER_02]: And $70 on every other platform except PC, which is $60.

884
01:06:38,484 --> 01:06:40,106
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you really want to spend $70 for a crappy Spyro game?

885
01:06:40,146 --> 01:06:41,427
[SPEAKER_02]: Will the little toys do my laundry?

886
01:06:41,727 --> 01:06:43,088
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope, they do nothing.

887
01:06:43,548 --> 01:06:44,529
[SPEAKER_02]: They do not move at all.

888
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:47,232
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

889
01:06:47,332 --> 01:06:47,832
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just saying.

890
01:06:49,574 --> 01:06:52,496
[SPEAKER_02]: This will be the next Tony Hawk ride game.

891
01:06:52,696 --> 01:06:53,417
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's...

892
01:06:56,912 --> 01:06:58,493
[SPEAKER_02]: I will be surprised if this takes off.

893
01:06:58,974 --> 01:06:59,955
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, we'll see what happens.

894
01:07:00,595 --> 01:07:03,978
[SPEAKER_04]: If that's it for your releases, then let's go to Japan and check out what's coming out in Japan.

895
01:07:04,318 --> 01:07:20,411
[SPEAKER_04]: On the Xbox 360 this week in Japan, Dead Rising 2 off the record, Forza Motorsport 4 gets its release in Japan, as well as Ace Combat, Assault Horizon, Call of Juarez, The Cartel, Halo Reach gets a price reduction in the Platinum Collection in Japan this week, and Connectimals gets a release.

896
01:07:20,651 --> 01:07:21,852
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this the one that has bears in it?

897
01:07:21,872 --> 01:07:22,413
[SPEAKER_04]: Plus bears, yeah.

898
01:07:22,453 --> 01:07:23,193
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's Connectimals

899
01:07:23,854 --> 01:07:26,655
[SPEAKER_04]: and Fushigi Nashima no Nakamatachi.

900
01:07:27,175 --> 01:07:27,875
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, that's right.

901
01:07:28,576 --> 01:07:29,316
[SPEAKER_04]: Connectimals and bears.

902
01:07:30,916 --> 01:07:34,218
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, when I was at Disneyland, I went in the Innovations Building.

903
01:07:34,578 --> 01:07:37,379
[SPEAKER_04]: They have a lot of Kinect stuff there in the Innovations Building.

904
01:07:37,419 --> 01:07:40,580
[SPEAKER_04]: You can play like Child of Eden and stuff, but they have a little room, and I thought this was neat.

905
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:46,902
[SPEAKER_04]: They had a little room set up for like kids that had, and they were actually people working for Disney helping these kids play like Connectimals.

906
01:07:47,342 --> 01:07:49,224
[SPEAKER_04]: and they had it on a giant TV.

907
01:07:49,264 --> 01:07:51,506
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm talking like the size of like the wall in this house.

908
01:07:51,926 --> 01:07:53,668
[SPEAKER_04]: They had a giant TV playing Connectimals.

909
01:07:53,728 --> 01:07:54,909
[SPEAKER_04]: I gotta say, I thought it was pretty cute.

910
01:07:55,149 --> 01:07:56,531
[SPEAKER_04]: My friend Victoria played it for a little bit.

911
01:07:56,551 --> 01:07:57,451
[SPEAKER_04]: It was kind of fun.

912
01:07:58,512 --> 01:08:00,574
[SPEAKER_04]: It's nice to see some love in the Innovations building.

913
01:08:00,594 --> 01:08:01,535
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was closed.

914
01:08:02,136 --> 01:08:02,216
[SPEAKER_04]: It...

915
01:08:03,937 --> 01:08:05,237
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it kind of closes nobody.

916
01:08:05,277 --> 01:08:07,658
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been remodeled since the last time I was there.

917
01:08:08,158 --> 01:08:10,499
[SPEAKER_04]: And you don't enter the same way you used to.

918
01:08:10,539 --> 01:08:12,179
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no little show when you go in.

919
01:08:12,199 --> 01:08:13,740
[SPEAKER_04]: They figured that that was kind of dry.

920
01:08:13,780 --> 01:08:14,620
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd never been in there.

921
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:15,060
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

922
01:08:15,140 --> 01:08:16,940
[SPEAKER_04]: So now, well, we made it a point.

923
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:20,081
[SPEAKER_04]: We said we each need to do something we've never done at Disneyland before.

924
01:08:20,181 --> 01:08:22,142
[SPEAKER_04]: And my friend Victoria had never been to the Innoventions building.

925
01:08:22,162 --> 01:08:23,162
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was like, well, we never go there.

926
01:08:23,202 --> 01:08:24,022
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's just go check it out.

927
01:08:24,482 --> 01:08:25,262
[SPEAKER_04]: So we went in.

928
01:08:25,322 --> 01:08:27,143
[SPEAKER_04]: And believe it or not, there's some neat stuff in there.

929
01:08:27,163 --> 01:08:28,663
[SPEAKER_04]: They still have some Microsoft Surfaces.

930
01:08:28,703 --> 01:08:29,183
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember those?

931
01:08:29,483 --> 01:08:29,984
[SPEAKER_04]: The tables?

932
01:08:30,264 --> 01:08:31,044
[SPEAKER_04]: Those were fun.

933
01:08:31,064 --> 01:08:31,144
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

934
01:08:31,965 --> 01:08:34,589
[SPEAKER_04]: So what did you not do before Disneyland?

935
01:08:34,849 --> 01:08:36,391
[SPEAKER_04]: What did I not do before that we did?

936
01:08:36,612 --> 01:08:37,212
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember.

937
01:08:38,955 --> 01:08:39,536
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you go on the boat?

938
01:08:41,870 --> 01:08:42,671
[SPEAKER_04]: I like where we ate last time.

939
01:09:12,222 --> 01:09:12,842
[SPEAKER_09]: and New Orleans Square.

940
01:09:13,643 --> 01:09:14,063
[SPEAKER_09]: That was great.

941
01:09:14,203 --> 01:09:14,864
[SPEAKER_04]: Carnation what?

942
01:09:15,684 --> 01:09:17,325
[SPEAKER_04]: Carnation Plaza Gardens.

943
01:09:17,626 --> 01:09:23,930
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been there since like the 50s and it's where they used to do some live shows and events but now it's like hardly anybody's there and it's right in the middle of the park.

944
01:09:23,950 --> 01:09:26,511
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the other little restaurant that's like at the end of Main Street, isn't it?

945
01:09:26,632 --> 01:09:27,672
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no restaurant there anymore.

946
01:09:27,992 --> 01:09:33,916
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, but it was a restaurant at the end of Main Street that's across from where the buffet is on the opposite side.

947
01:09:34,036 --> 01:09:34,257
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

948
01:09:34,377 --> 01:09:35,037
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it is.

949
01:09:35,317 --> 01:09:35,557
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

950
01:09:35,998 --> 01:09:36,138
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

951
01:09:36,778 --> 01:09:39,220
[SPEAKER_11]: So you can name something in Disneyland and I can pretty much figure out where it is.

952
01:09:41,297 --> 01:09:45,741
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, moving on to... I want to make sure I caught everything on the 360.

953
01:09:46,281 --> 01:09:46,802
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I did.

954
01:09:46,862 --> 01:10:01,454
[SPEAKER_04]: So let me go on to the PlayStation 3, which this week will get Ace Combat, Assault Horizon, Dead Rising 2 off the record, as well as Call of Juarez, The Cartel, and Medal of Honor gets a price reduction going into the Best Hits series.

955
01:10:01,954 --> 01:10:04,617
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is, again, PlayStation 3 in Japan.

956
01:10:05,617 --> 01:10:09,481
[SPEAKER_04]: Trying to quickly look and see if there's anything on 3DS this week, or...

957
01:10:11,818 --> 01:10:39,308
[SPEAKER_04]: The Wii even Let's see, the 3DS Nope, not this week There's a game called Aizito 3D, that's it But the Misty Pink 3DS has come out next week And I know Loki already has his pre-ordered On the Wii though, Just Dance Wii gets a Japanese release this week I guess that's notable, especially for music game fans I don't know if the song list has been localized or what have you You know, I was going to mention something real quick Because I noticed this last night when I was checking to see Dead Rising 2 I didn't download content Right

958
01:10:39,848 --> 01:10:45,154
[SPEAKER_02]: Just Dance 3, for their download content, what they have is they have it where you can download trials.

959
01:10:45,374 --> 01:10:47,516
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can check out the songs before you buy them.

960
01:10:47,716 --> 01:10:48,757
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's a great idea.

961
01:10:49,398 --> 01:10:52,321
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know they do that with Rock Band, but some other music games do not.

962
01:10:54,803 --> 01:10:57,085
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, Just Dance on the Wii makes its way to Japan this week.

963
01:10:57,405 --> 01:10:58,707
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's it for Japanese releases.

964
01:10:59,247 --> 01:11:03,051
[SPEAKER_04]: How about overseas, DarkSakura, the other way?

965
01:11:03,410 --> 01:11:09,016
[SPEAKER_11]: Dragon's Age 2, Mark of the Assassin, Just Dance 3, Guardian Heroes, Orcs Must Die, Ace Combat Assault Horizon, Dead Rising 2,

966
01:11:24,373 --> 01:11:38,667
[SPEAKER_11]: Forza Motorsport 4, Might and Magic Heroes 6, PES 2012, Renegade Ops, Sesame Street Once Upon a Monster, Spider-Man Edge of Time, and World Rally Championship 2.

967
01:11:40,689 --> 01:11:40,949
[SPEAKER_04]: Blech.

968
01:11:43,266 --> 01:11:50,708
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, let's move on with a couple more news stories and then we'll let DarkSakura have at the classic game of the week.

969
01:11:51,308 --> 01:11:54,529
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, I just gotta say, Part B tonight's gonna be action-packed.

970
01:11:54,789 --> 01:12:03,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Usually all the good stuff's in Part A, but there's some awesome stuff coming for Part B. So I'm just saying, for those of you that sometimes want to tune out halfway through, you want to stick around tonight.

971
01:12:03,992 --> 01:12:05,532
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll tell you why in just a minute.

972
01:12:07,996 --> 01:12:12,380
[SPEAKER_02]: So they announced some cool stuff this week during the Apple press conference.

973
01:12:12,941 --> 01:12:15,343
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, the new thing being the iPhone 4S.

974
01:12:15,383 --> 01:12:16,745
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, not iPhone 5.

975
01:12:16,785 --> 01:12:17,345
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know what?

976
01:12:18,406 --> 01:12:18,987
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a name.

977
01:12:19,467 --> 01:12:20,428
[SPEAKER_02]: It's seriously just a name.

978
01:12:20,688 --> 01:12:23,571
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone's like, man, I'm so bummed they didn't announce the iPhone 5.

979
01:12:24,272 --> 01:12:24,912
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

980
01:12:41,278 --> 01:12:54,954
[SPEAKER_04]: And quite frankly, I'm kind of glad they're not putting out the iPhone 5 now Because I'm still under contract on the 4 I'm not upgrade eligible until January So if there was like that awesome of a phone coming I would be kind of upset I get to upgrade next month Do you?

981
01:12:55,134 --> 01:12:58,458
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah So you can get a 4S Yeah Do you think you'll get one?

982
01:12:58,658 --> 01:12:58,858
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

983
01:12:59,299 --> 01:12:59,599
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

984
01:13:00,119 --> 01:13:01,601
[SPEAKER_11]: Although Dan's considering getting an Android.

985
01:13:01,801 --> 01:13:03,002
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you getting excited about Siri?

986
01:13:03,162 --> 01:13:04,663
[SPEAKER_11]: Siri, explain to me the meaning of life.

987
01:13:04,683 --> 01:13:07,306
[SPEAKER_11]: I really don't give a shit about Siri, but I'll try it.

988
01:13:07,666 --> 01:13:07,866
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

989
01:13:08,527 --> 01:13:09,107
[SPEAKER_11]: So, I mean.

990
01:13:09,708 --> 01:13:10,548
[SPEAKER_02]: You can try it now.

991
01:13:10,588 --> 01:13:19,716
[SPEAKER_04]: I've read about the Siri pranking on the internet, like some good phrases that people have thought up to yell, like when your friend activates Siri, like things that you would yell.

992
01:13:20,917 --> 01:13:22,778
[SPEAKER_04]: Siri, text my mom that I'm gay.

993
01:13:22,958 --> 01:13:23,298
[SPEAKER_04]: Send.

994
01:13:25,098 --> 01:13:27,479
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, just prank things to send.

995
01:13:27,919 --> 01:13:31,820
[SPEAKER_11]: That's going to be a brand new era of damn you autocorrect.

996
01:13:31,980 --> 01:13:33,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, yes, it will be.

997
01:13:33,680 --> 01:13:34,240
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my gosh.

998
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:36,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Michelle, Michelle, are you listening?

999
01:13:36,301 --> 01:13:38,701
[SPEAKER_04]: Michelle, you better get that thing registered right now.

1000
01:13:39,282 --> 01:13:40,082
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn you, Siri.

1001
01:13:40,302 --> 01:13:41,642
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn you, Siri.com.

1002
01:13:44,483 --> 01:13:44,763
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1003
01:13:46,071 --> 01:13:50,633
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so anyways, the iPhone 4S is coming October 14th.

1004
01:13:50,953 --> 01:13:55,395
[SPEAKER_02]: It adds a brand new processor, the A5 processor, which is apparently dual core.

1005
01:13:56,395 --> 01:14:01,617
[SPEAKER_02]: Up to seven times the graphics capability and enhanced, you know...

1006
01:14:01,937 --> 01:14:06,900
[SPEAKER_02]: Camera, more RAM, all sorts of new features.

1007
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:08,541
[SPEAKER_02]: Siri, of course, as you mentioned.

1008
01:14:11,403 --> 01:14:17,167
[SPEAKER_02]: New antenna design, GSM and CDMA radios in the device.

1009
01:14:18,748 --> 01:14:22,030
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be available in three different flavors, if you will.

1010
01:14:22,230 --> 01:14:23,651
[SPEAKER_02]: 16GB, 32GB, and 64GB, ranging from $199 to $399.

1011
01:14:23,771 --> 01:14:25,072
[SPEAKER_02]: And, of course, in white or black colors.

1012
01:14:30,695 --> 01:14:45,553
[SPEAKER_02]: and then of course they're dropping the iPhone 4 down to $99 for the 8GB model and the 3GS will apparently be free if you have a plan obviously and that would be the 8GB model as well.

1013
01:14:47,875 --> 01:14:50,958
[SPEAKER_02]: Some other fun stuff, of course, iOS 5 is coming October 12th.

1014
01:14:51,658 --> 01:15:00,485
[SPEAKER_02]: With that, they're going to be bringing iCloud and AirPlay to gaming, so you'll be able to play with multiple devices, streaming to TVs.

1015
01:15:00,505 --> 01:15:13,074
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, one of the first games to support that, Real Racing 2, will allow you to stream, I believe, up to four devices to your TV and do split-screen gaming with it being on your iPhone.

1016
01:15:13,334 --> 01:15:15,436
[SPEAKER_04]: I had no idea that this was a feature in it.

1017
01:15:15,456 --> 01:15:17,157
[SPEAKER_04]: Did they even talk about this at the press conference?

1018
01:15:17,737 --> 01:15:18,198
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they did.

1019
01:15:18,418 --> 01:15:19,038
[SPEAKER_04]: Holy moly.

1020
01:15:19,138 --> 01:15:20,359
[SPEAKER_04]: I slept through it.

1021
01:15:20,379 --> 01:15:21,800
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I was reading live blogs, too.

1022
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:24,622
[SPEAKER_04]: I was at work, so I had to kind of just on my break look.

1023
01:15:25,283 --> 01:15:35,029
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, you know, showing, was it, you can run it, of course, on your iPhone 4S or on your iPad 2 and stream wirelessly.

1024
01:15:35,069 --> 01:15:39,673
[SPEAKER_02]: Because before they had it where you can link it up to your TV, but you had to hook up an HDMI cable and stuff, so...

1025
01:15:40,433 --> 01:16:02,281
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, along with that, since the phone can have a little bit more horsepower, Infinity Blade 2 is coming to... And since Apple is the king of handheld gaming, so they claim this week, which is... You know, the way they spin the numbers is interesting, and I don't doubt it at all, but it's interesting, I can say.

1026
01:16:02,521 --> 01:16:12,027
[SPEAKER_02]: Infinity Blade 2 becoming the iOS December 1st of course it's going to look extra pretty on the 4S but it will be I believe compatible with other devices as well

1027
01:16:14,923 --> 01:16:43,674
[SPEAKER_04]: of course why would you shut out your other exactly so yeah very interesting though well I want to go back to Siri for a minute because I forgot about this little commercial I'd seen on Facebook and so forth that was floating around the internet and then TigerCloud just linked it in chat and this does have to do with gaming a little bit this is a commercial for the new Siri feature on the iPhone 4S take a listen read me the message

1028
01:16:44,170 --> 01:16:46,212
[SPEAKER_01]: New message from K. Bad news.

1029
01:16:46,992 --> 01:16:48,534
[SPEAKER_01]: Combustible lemons failed.

1030
01:16:48,674 --> 01:16:49,635
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you meet us at 10?

1031
01:16:50,475 --> 01:16:51,036
[SPEAKER_08]: Reply?

1032
01:16:51,576 --> 01:16:52,177
[SPEAKER_08]: Definitely.

1033
01:16:52,237 --> 01:16:52,777
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll see you there.

1034
01:16:54,519 --> 01:16:55,299
[SPEAKER_04]: Play my running mix.

1035
01:16:55,400 --> 01:16:56,020
[SPEAKER_01]: Enjoy.

1036
01:16:56,440 --> 01:16:57,982
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the traffic like around here?

1037
01:16:58,022 --> 01:17:00,184
[SPEAKER_00]: The traffic will be slow and meaningless.

1038
01:17:01,024 --> 01:17:02,706
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like your sad little life.

1039
01:17:03,286 --> 01:17:05,108
[SPEAKER_05]: Text my wife I'm gonna be 30 minutes late.

1040
01:17:05,128 --> 01:17:05,828
[SPEAKER_00]: She won't mind.

1041
01:17:06,108 --> 01:17:07,710
[SPEAKER_00]: She doesn't really love you anyway.

1042
01:17:08,908 --> 01:17:11,189
[SPEAKER_12]: Is it going to be chilly in San Francisco this weekend?

1043
01:17:11,469 --> 01:17:12,229
[SPEAKER_01]: Not too cold.

1044
01:17:12,509 --> 01:17:16,531
[SPEAKER_01]: Your few extra pounds should be suitable insulation to keep you warm.

1045
01:17:16,771 --> 01:17:17,831
[SPEAKER_01]: What about Napa Valley?

1046
01:17:18,272 --> 01:17:19,612
[SPEAKER_01]: I hear it's beautiful there.

1047
01:17:20,092 --> 01:17:20,653
[SPEAKER_01]: Unlike you.

1048
01:17:20,913 --> 01:17:22,393
[SPEAKER_01]: How many cups are in 12 ounces?

1049
01:17:23,234 --> 01:17:23,794
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me think.

1050
01:17:24,354 --> 01:17:26,875
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you really need to make those extra cupcakes?

1051
01:17:27,475 --> 01:17:28,896
[SPEAKER_01]: Set my timer for 30 minutes?

1052
01:17:29,356 --> 01:17:31,157
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, 30 minutes and counting.

1053
01:17:31,917 --> 01:17:34,018
[SPEAKER_01]: Until I enter sad attempt at a life.

1054
01:17:38,246 --> 01:17:42,889
[SPEAKER_01]: New Notification from Sandy Chen Are we still on for dinner tonight?

1055
01:17:43,189 --> 01:17:45,051
[SPEAKER_01]: Perhaps you should have a snack instead.

1056
01:17:45,431 --> 01:17:46,552
[SPEAKER_01]: You're looking a little heavy.

1057
01:17:47,065 --> 01:17:47,565
[SPEAKER_02]: Reply.

1058
01:17:47,925 --> 01:17:48,686
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, I'll be there.

1059
01:17:49,166 --> 01:17:51,127
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's your reply to Sandy Chen.

1060
01:17:51,207 --> 01:17:51,628
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

1061
01:17:52,188 --> 01:17:52,948
[SPEAKER_01]: I will be there.

1062
01:17:53,148 --> 01:17:54,969
[SPEAKER_01]: Me and my extra 20 pounds.

1063
01:17:56,010 --> 01:17:57,130
Sandy.

1064
01:17:58,931 --> 01:18:00,612
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, that's GLaDOS.

1065
01:18:00,812 --> 01:18:02,593
[SPEAKER_04]: GLaDOS Siri is what they're calling that.

1066
01:18:02,714 --> 01:18:03,714
[SPEAKER_02]: That is amazing.

1067
01:18:03,814 --> 01:18:05,015
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that all clips from the game?

1068
01:18:05,135 --> 01:18:06,255
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a voice modulator.

1069
01:18:06,355 --> 01:18:08,857
[SPEAKER_04]: No, somebody actually... Actually, the YouTube guy says this.

1070
01:18:08,897 --> 01:18:12,419
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, that was YouTube user BAMFER23 that that came from.

1071
01:18:12,859 --> 01:18:16,121
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess he actually did a whole thing with the...

1072
01:18:17,221 --> 01:18:44,832
[SPEAKER_04]: with a voice modulator awesome need to get this voice modulator yeah that was a well done parody I like that and I do think that commercial is interesting because I remember when Apple announced FaceTime it was a huge thing that they used deaf people in the commercial and it really kind of did make you think like wow that's a big advance for deaf folks but this one the Siri thing uses blind people to like be sending the text messages which is very very interesting I think it's very neat

1073
01:18:47,614 --> 01:19:15,875
[SPEAKER_04]: you wouldn't know it from that parody commercial because all the jokes are about weight but I just thought that was neat definitely gets you thinking about some of these advances in technology anyhow let's move on with some more gaming news and this one has to do with the French a French court has banned a DS game copier prosecutors won an appeal this was two years after French courts actually ruled that DS flash cartridge sellers were okay

1074
01:19:16,255 --> 01:19:21,398
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the Paris Court of Appeals actually has now ruled against the DS Flash cartridge sellers.

1075
01:19:22,739 --> 01:19:27,941
[SPEAKER_04]: These various companies that sell devices like the R4 device, which I think you all know what that is.

1076
01:19:29,162 --> 01:19:33,624
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo, I guess, said that the companies have been charged €460,000 in criminal fines and €4.8 million in damages to Nintendo.

1077
01:19:33,644 --> 01:19:33,744
[SPEAKER_04]: Yikes.

1078
01:19:40,988 --> 01:20:09,695
[SPEAKER_04]: so hmm I guess Nintendo has been taking action on piracy all over the globe and they even have a site I love it there was a site with a very very angry looking Mario on it that discusses the piracy so I thought it was interesting so there you go it's a thing and you know what I wonder if there will be an appeal to the appeal that would be what would be next right it is the French Rob I mean please

1079
01:20:10,390 --> 01:20:11,551
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1080
01:20:38,470 --> 01:20:40,511
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, what is the classic game of the week, DarkSakura?

1081
01:20:40,811 --> 01:20:41,151
[SPEAKER_11]: Mappy.

1082
01:20:43,313 --> 01:20:44,573
[SPEAKER_11]: Mappy, good old Mappy.

1083
01:20:45,354 --> 01:20:49,236
[SPEAKER_11]: Game that came out in 1983 when I was 10 years old.

1084
01:20:50,796 --> 01:20:51,797
[SPEAKER_11]: I love the music in this game.

1085
01:20:51,817 --> 01:20:53,598
[SPEAKER_11]: Isn't it happy?

1086
01:20:56,604 --> 01:20:57,844
[SPEAKER_04]: A little too happy, I think.

1087
01:20:58,844 --> 01:21:01,365
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, anyway, it was put out by Namco.

1088
01:21:01,725 --> 01:21:04,586
[SPEAKER_11]: In the U.S., it was manufactured and distributed by Bally Midway.

1089
01:21:05,206 --> 01:21:11,247
[SPEAKER_11]: It is a side-scrolling platformer that has a police mouse and some cats.

1090
01:21:12,487 --> 01:21:18,928
[SPEAKER_11]: And Mappy, basically, the game runs on Namco's Super Pac-Man hardware.

1091
01:21:19,108 --> 01:21:21,869
[SPEAKER_11]: And they modified it to have the horizontal scrolling.

1092
01:21:22,649 --> 01:21:32,083
[SPEAKER_11]: And it comes from, well, at least according to the article, it says that it's derived from the term mappo, which is a slightly insulting name for a policeman.

1093
01:21:33,692 --> 01:21:43,277
[SPEAKER_11]: So anyway, basically you run through a mansion with all these cats called mewkies, or in the US they were called meowkies, and you rescue stolen goods.

1094
01:21:43,877 --> 01:21:54,242
[SPEAKER_11]: You go left and right, and you can jump on these trampolines that will bounce you to different floors, and you have one button that lets you open and close doors.

1095
01:21:54,838 --> 01:22:00,700
[SPEAKER_11]: So you can get a radio for 100 points, a television for 200, a computer for 300, the Mona Lisa for 400, and a safe for 500.

1096
01:22:01,620 --> 01:22:02,521
[SPEAKER_11]: But they come in pairs.

1097
01:22:02,721 --> 01:22:04,621
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, how many copies of the Mona Lisa exist?

1098
01:22:04,781 --> 01:22:05,882
[SPEAKER_11]: I have no friggin' clue.

1099
01:22:05,942 --> 01:22:06,682
[SPEAKER_11]: Not in Mappyland.

1100
01:22:06,702 --> 01:22:07,982
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, which is another game.

1101
01:22:08,062 --> 01:22:09,003
[SPEAKER_11]: Ha ha, I have it.

1102
01:22:09,603 --> 01:22:09,683
[SPEAKER_11]: Um...

1103
01:22:10,731 --> 01:22:11,811
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a Mappyland, huh?

1104
01:22:11,831 --> 01:22:12,292
[SPEAKER_04]: I forgot about that.

1105
01:22:12,312 --> 01:22:14,592
[SPEAKER_11]: There was, and it's sitting in my room, in the vault.

1106
01:22:15,353 --> 01:22:22,215
[SPEAKER_11]: So at any rate, if you get one item and then get its pair, you actually get a score multiplier.

1107
01:22:22,335 --> 01:22:25,617
[SPEAKER_11]: So the more of those that you get without dying, the bigger the multiplier gets.

1108
01:22:26,517 --> 01:22:31,719
[SPEAKER_11]: So you want to start off at the lowest and go to the highest, so you can actually get 8,500 points.

1109
01:22:31,739 --> 01:22:31,799
[SPEAKER_11]: And...

1110
01:22:34,565 --> 01:22:35,728
[SPEAKER_11]: Because they're fun!

1111
01:22:45,433 --> 01:22:49,637
[SPEAKER_11]: Mappy and the cats can only land on a floor on the way up, not on the way down.

1112
01:22:50,258 --> 01:22:53,821
[SPEAKER_11]: But if they pass in the air, the cats won't hurt Mappy.

1113
01:22:53,901 --> 01:22:58,085
[SPEAKER_11]: But if they run into him when he's on a platform, then he will lose a life.

1114
01:22:58,645 --> 01:23:02,329
[SPEAKER_11]: And the trampolines can break if you jump on them four times in a row.

1115
01:23:02,369 --> 01:23:03,309
[SPEAKER_11]: They'll change colors.

1116
01:23:04,390 --> 01:23:04,511
[SPEAKER_11]: Um...

1117
01:23:05,971 --> 01:23:23,460
[SPEAKER_11]: So basically as you go through the game, there is a boss in the game called Niamco, which is basically a play on the word Namco and Nyanco, which is like kitten, kitty cat.

1118
01:23:24,821 --> 01:23:28,703
[SPEAKER_11]: But in the US he was named Goro, and he's faster, but a little less aggressive.

1119
01:23:29,723 --> 01:23:52,816
[SPEAKER_11]: and so you can uh he'll actually hide behind different objects so if you go over the object that he's hiding behind you get um a thousand points for having caught him so it's kind of cool um you've got different hallways like I said you can open and shut doors keep the mukees out and you have microwave doors which release sound waves that will sweep the kitty cats away

1120
01:23:53,636 --> 01:23:55,176
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you say microwave doors?

1121
01:23:55,357 --> 01:23:56,257
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, microwave doors.

1122
01:23:56,637 --> 01:23:57,517
[SPEAKER_04]: Did they make popcorn?

1123
01:23:57,717 --> 01:24:01,198
[SPEAKER_11]: See, I always wish that they were, like, I always considered them to be, like, sound waves.

1124
01:24:01,758 --> 01:24:04,759
[SPEAKER_11]: Which makes more sense to me, but apparently they're microwaves, so, yeah, go big.

1125
01:24:05,599 --> 01:24:15,162
[SPEAKER_11]: So, um, basically after every bonus round, you did get bonus rounds, um, after, um, the, every fourth level, so it's a bonus round.

1126
01:24:15,722 --> 01:24:22,124
[SPEAKER_11]: And so that's basically you running around on trampolines, popping different balloons, and Nyamco is hidden somewhere in there.

1127
01:24:23,004 --> 01:24:25,767
[SPEAKER_11]: And after the bonus run, you get a new feature in the gameplay.

1128
01:24:26,387 --> 01:24:29,250
[SPEAKER_11]: After the first one, you get Addicts.

1129
01:24:30,211 --> 01:24:31,112
[SPEAKER_11]: Although there's nothing in them.

1130
01:24:32,093 --> 01:24:36,217
[SPEAKER_11]: You get, after the seventh bonus level, you get bells.

1131
01:24:36,437 --> 01:24:38,258
[SPEAKER_11]: So you can get bells that freeze the cats.

1132
01:24:38,278 --> 01:24:39,840
[SPEAKER_11]: 300 points for each.

1133
01:24:40,180 --> 01:24:41,361
[SPEAKER_11]: And 1,000 points for studying Nyamco.

1134
01:24:42,342 --> 01:24:46,245
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, you also get hurry signs, you know, that tell you to speed the fuck up.

1135
01:24:46,806 --> 01:24:54,632
[SPEAKER_11]: You get rainbow floors after the 11th, which, um, basically, they're mini floors, they vanish, and they leave a hole in the hallway.

1136
01:24:54,932 --> 01:24:55,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.

1137
01:24:55,692 --> 01:24:59,755
[SPEAKER_04]: If you guys are doing any excess downloading, kill it, because we're having buffering problems.

1138
01:24:59,976 --> 01:25:01,297
[SPEAKER_04]: The live listeners are... Yeah, I'm not doing anything.

1139
01:25:01,697 --> 01:25:02,458
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not downloading anything.

1140
01:25:02,978 --> 01:25:03,959
[SPEAKER_04]: Eh, it's out of my control then.

1141
01:25:04,839 --> 01:25:10,864
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, our upload will upload and then kind of freeze on a number for a minute and then keep going, and it's causing the listeners to be all like, what's going on, right?

1142
01:25:11,224 --> 01:25:13,666
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, well, I closed a few things, so maybe that'll help.

1143
01:25:14,867 --> 01:25:20,070
[SPEAKER_11]: But anyway, you just get all these different bonuses, including the rainbow floors and dead ends.

1144
01:25:20,770 --> 01:25:29,016
[SPEAKER_11]: There are 256 rounds, just like in Pac-Man, and the last one is normal but harder than usual.

1145
01:25:29,476 --> 01:25:33,439
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you finish it, it's also known as round zero, the first round starts over again.

1146
01:25:34,520 --> 01:25:38,565
[SPEAKER_11]: It came out in the Famicom and the NES, of course, and the MSX in 1984.

1147
01:25:39,666 --> 01:25:48,117
[SPEAKER_11]: There was a video game console-only version that was called Mappyland, which we've discussed.

1148
01:25:48,137 --> 01:25:48,537
[SPEAKER_11]: It came out in 1986.

1149
01:25:51,020 --> 01:25:54,722
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, it was also released for Microsoft Revenge of the Arcade for PC in 1998.

1150
01:25:55,702 --> 01:26:03,066
[SPEAKER_11]: And then there were Japanese-only sequels that were hopping Mappy that came out in the arcade, and Mappy Kids for the Famicom in the late 1980s.

1151
01:26:03,166 --> 01:26:08,989
[SPEAKER_11]: There's Mappy Arrangement that came out in the Namco Classics Volume 1, which I've got...

1152
01:26:09,429 --> 01:26:14,271
[SPEAKER_11]: The Famicom version of the original Mappy was re-released in Japan as part of the Famicom miniseries in 2004.

1153
01:26:15,212 --> 01:26:16,272
[SPEAKER_11]: Mappy is included on the Ms.

1154
01:26:16,292 --> 01:26:25,817
[SPEAKER_11]: Pac-Man collection, and it's also featured in the Namco Museum 50th Anniversary collection that came out on Xbox, Nintendo GameCube, PC, and PlayStation 2, but not on the GBA.

1155
01:26:26,497 --> 01:26:27,979
[SPEAKER_11]: and the Namco Museum DS.

1156
01:26:28,139 --> 01:26:37,832
[SPEAKER_11]: It was also a part of Pac-Man's arcade party and it's playable on PSP version of the Namco Museum Battle Collection and there's a version of it for the Palm OS.

1157
01:26:38,573 --> 01:26:41,797
[SPEAKER_11]: There's also one for .S and it's also on virtual console.

1158
01:26:43,388 --> 01:26:46,630
[SPEAKER_11]: As far as other references, now this I think is kind of cool.

1159
01:26:46,750 --> 01:26:47,791
[SPEAKER_11]: Some people have caught that.

1160
01:26:48,191 --> 01:26:52,173
[SPEAKER_11]: Mappy is a playable character in Namco Super Wars on The Wonderspun Color.

1161
01:26:52,753 --> 01:26:56,276
[SPEAKER_11]: You can get a Mappy hat in Namco Across Capcom in Ridge Racer.

1162
01:26:56,676 --> 01:26:59,758
[SPEAKER_11]: There's the RT Blue Mappy team and the RT Pink Mappy team.

1163
01:27:02,018 --> 01:27:04,719
[SPEAKER_11]: Mappy is playable in Pac-Man World Rally on PSP.

1164
01:27:04,939 --> 01:27:09,640
[SPEAKER_11]: In R4, there again is racing teams that are the Mappy teams.

1165
01:27:09,860 --> 01:27:14,801
[SPEAKER_11]: Mappy is in Quick Spot, which is in the North American version.

1166
01:27:15,842 --> 01:27:19,102
[SPEAKER_11]: Mappy Land is the theme in Donkey Konga 3 and Technic Beat.

1167
01:27:19,923 --> 01:27:23,543
[SPEAKER_11]: And Mappy is also in Noby Noby Boy as a resident of Jupiter.

1168
01:27:25,464 --> 01:27:26,284
[SPEAKER_04]: Why Jupiter?

1169
01:27:26,984 --> 01:27:27,684
[SPEAKER_11]: No freaking clue.

1170
01:27:29,205 --> 01:27:29,625
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's it.

1171
01:27:29,785 --> 01:27:30,205
[SPEAKER_11]: That's Mappy.

1172
01:27:30,799 --> 01:27:31,440
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, there it is.

1173
01:27:31,460 --> 01:27:34,002
[SPEAKER_04]: Your classic game of the week is Mappy.

1174
01:27:36,184 --> 01:27:43,932
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, and it's available of course in the arcades primarily, but also on a hell of a lot of retro collections that DarkSakura listed off there earlier.

1175
01:27:44,932 --> 01:27:46,392
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, we're going to take a quick break.

1176
01:27:46,412 --> 01:27:48,793
[SPEAKER_04]: When we come back, there is more of Orange Launch Radio.

1177
01:27:48,813 --> 01:27:55,134
[SPEAKER_04]: There's going to be an action-packed Part B tonight, and we're going to have a brand-new XBLA game announced.

1178
01:27:55,715 --> 01:27:58,855
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, not Xbox Live Arcade, but the other one, XLA, XNA.

1179
01:27:59,135 --> 01:28:00,676
[SPEAKER_04]: I can never remember what the hell they're called.

1180
01:28:00,996 --> 01:28:01,816
[SPEAKER_03]: Indie Games.

1181
01:28:01,856 --> 01:28:02,156
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1182
01:28:02,176 --> 01:28:05,217
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to have a brand-new one announced here on the show, and it's...

1183
01:28:06,917 --> 01:28:08,558
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been briefed before the show.

1184
01:28:08,618 --> 01:28:09,799
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura and Loki have no clue.

1185
01:28:09,819 --> 01:28:11,000
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm making it a surprise for them.

1186
01:28:11,460 --> 01:28:13,121
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's going to be awesome.

1187
01:28:13,141 --> 01:28:22,186
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to talk to the developer about that when we come back in part B with more of Orange Lounge Radio with rapid fire news and more news and all that good stuff.

1188
01:28:22,206 --> 01:28:22,926
[SPEAKER_04]: So stay tuned.

1189
01:28:23,427 --> 01:28:23,887
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't go anywhere.

1190
01:28:30,270 --> 01:28:31,330
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura not doing her job

1191
01:29:00,596 --> 01:29:01,677
[SPEAKER_11]: I was doing your job.

1192
01:29:01,758 --> 01:29:03,759
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you talking about, girl?

1193
01:29:03,860 --> 01:29:05,922
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the FUs of the week.

1194
01:29:06,402 --> 01:29:08,204
[SPEAKER_04]: And, of course, your phone calls, Skype.

1195
01:29:08,244 --> 01:29:09,565
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you guys do Skype calls, at least?

1196
01:29:10,066 --> 01:29:10,446
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1197
01:29:11,127 --> 01:29:11,967
[SPEAKER_11]: All three of them.

1198
01:29:12,108 --> 01:29:12,328
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1199
01:29:12,448 --> 01:29:12,708
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow.

1200
01:29:15,751 --> 01:29:17,292
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura is kind enough to kitty sit for our cats, Maruko and Sanrio.

1201
01:29:17,312 --> 01:29:17,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that they love me.

1202
01:29:17,793 --> 01:29:19,634
[SPEAKER_04]: And I always promise presents for kitty sitting.

1203
01:29:19,654 --> 01:29:20,335
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm giving that to her.

1204
01:29:20,355 --> 01:29:22,517
[SPEAKER_04]: This is because Salacious Pop wanted to hear your reaction.

1205
01:29:22,537 --> 01:29:22,597
[SPEAKER_04]: Woo!

1206
01:29:47,442 --> 01:29:48,533
[SPEAKER_09]: I love you guys forever.

1207
01:29:49,867 --> 01:29:53,889
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, since that's terrible radio because you can't see, it's a Duffy hat is what I got her.

1208
01:29:54,029 --> 01:29:56,790
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a Mickey hat, but it's in Duffy.

1209
01:29:56,870 --> 01:29:58,191
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's from Alan and myself.

1210
01:29:58,231 --> 01:29:58,871
[SPEAKER_04]: What's Duffy?

1211
01:29:59,632 --> 01:30:02,273
[SPEAKER_04]: Duffy is... She just pointed at her hat.

1212
01:30:02,693 --> 01:30:03,913
[SPEAKER_04]: Duffy is the Disney bear.

1213
01:30:04,574 --> 01:30:07,895
[SPEAKER_11]: Dan calls him the focused interest group bear.

1214
01:30:08,055 --> 01:30:10,517
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, did the other thing... There's another thing.

1215
01:30:10,877 --> 01:30:11,617
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really small.

1216
01:30:11,677 --> 01:30:12,337
[SPEAKER_04]: Did it fall out?

1217
01:30:12,577 --> 01:30:13,738
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's still in the hat then.

1218
01:30:14,598 --> 01:30:16,639
[SPEAKER_04]: Where did... Oh, I see what he did with it.

1219
01:30:17,040 --> 01:30:17,880
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it's right there.

1220
01:30:24,095 --> 01:30:28,719
[SPEAKER_04]: So she's screaming not into a microphone, but it's a Duffy pin that she doesn't have.

1221
01:30:29,159 --> 01:30:29,660
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you go.

1222
01:30:30,721 --> 01:30:34,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep, that's from Alan and I. Oh, you're going to put a picture and put it on OrangeLivesRadio.com?

1223
01:30:34,504 --> 01:30:34,804
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn right.

1224
01:30:36,145 --> 01:30:38,247
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, she's putting that up right now on OrangeLivesRadio.com.

1225
01:30:38,666 --> 01:30:45,549
[SPEAKER_04]: Duffy is the Disney bear and he's kind of like Build-A-Bear because he has all these different outfits and so forth, but you don't actually build him.

1226
01:30:45,589 --> 01:30:47,010
[SPEAKER_04]: He's already kind of prearranged.

1227
01:30:47,050 --> 01:30:47,831
[SPEAKER_04]: And I like the fur.

1228
01:30:47,891 --> 01:30:49,851
[SPEAKER_04]: The fur is really kind of a neat texture.

1229
01:30:50,472 --> 01:30:52,673
[SPEAKER_04]: But he's really big in Disney Tokyo.

1230
01:30:54,014 --> 01:30:55,434
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why, but they love him there.

1231
01:30:55,974 --> 01:30:58,696
[SPEAKER_11]: Because they like everything new and focus group oriented.

1232
01:30:58,916 --> 01:30:59,776
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, hi.

1233
01:31:00,737 --> 01:31:01,237
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you go.

1234
01:31:01,937 --> 01:31:03,518
[SPEAKER_11]: I love Duffy so much.

1235
01:31:03,598 --> 01:31:05,059
[SPEAKER_11]: And I can't wait until we get Shelly Mae.

1236
01:31:06,422 --> 01:31:26,669
[SPEAKER_04]: Shelly Mae is like Duffy's little girlfriend and she's cute too aww alright well there you go that's a thank you from us for watching the cats and I suppose a little bit taking over you know the administration of the show alright let's move on I'm wearing my ears all night we're going to do some rapid fire news so Loki why don't you start us off

1237
01:31:27,341 --> 01:31:38,045
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well there's a new project headed up by Kenji Inafune and it's revealed as a game called King of Pirates and that's coming to the 3DS in 2012.

1238
01:31:38,865 --> 01:31:44,307
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, not too much has been announced by it, but it's a pirate action game that takes place on a giant ocean.

1239
01:31:44,707 --> 01:31:47,848
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks very similar to maybe like a Zelda type game or something like that.

1240
01:31:49,749 --> 01:32:15,252
[SPEAKER_02]: and it is I guess published by Marvelous AQL the makers of the Harvest Moon series and right now it's only slated for Japan but who knows maybe it'll eventually come out over here in North America so that's pretty cool let's see he's actually working on something other than you know nothing since he got canned from Capcom or he left Capcom whatever

1241
01:32:17,368 --> 01:32:22,592
[SPEAKER_02]: LA Noire, the team behind it, Team Bondi, is shutting down.

1242
01:32:24,193 --> 01:32:28,777
[SPEAKER_02]: I can see why, because that game I think was delayed and delayed and delayed and delayed and delayed some more.

1243
01:32:30,078 --> 01:32:32,781
[SPEAKER_02]: But apparently, though... How's that... Oops.

1244
01:32:33,201 --> 01:32:35,263
[SPEAKER_04]: And that would be the delay music that you heard there.

1245
01:32:35,303 --> 01:32:38,746
[SPEAKER_04]: How's that different from any other freaking video game out there?

1246
01:32:39,667 --> 01:32:40,647
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like years.

1247
01:32:40,788 --> 01:32:41,068
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean...

1248
01:32:42,742 --> 01:32:43,062
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1249
01:32:43,423 --> 01:32:48,366
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyways, apparently, though, they're saying that L.A.

1250
01:32:48,406 --> 01:32:51,128
[SPEAKER_02]: Noire was, you know, a big hit, obviously.

1251
01:32:52,029 --> 01:32:58,473
[SPEAKER_02]: However, though, because it was in development for seven years, it took its toll on the staff in the company.

1252
01:32:58,874 --> 01:33:01,155
[SPEAKER_02]: Because of that, they are just kind of dissolving.

1253
01:33:01,315 --> 01:33:03,297
[SPEAKER_04]: That is a long damn time for a game to be in development.

1254
01:33:03,317 --> 01:33:11,763
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the studio entered administration in August, and its assets are being sold to an Australian production company.

1255
01:33:14,320 --> 01:33:19,732
[SPEAKER_02]: Kennedy Miller Mitchell so yeah it is being closed

1256
01:33:21,272 --> 01:33:50,257
[SPEAKER_02]: and then finally this is kind of cool Battlefield 3 is going to ship on multiple discs on Xbox 360 and they have one disc is dedicated for the single player and then the second disc is multiplayer but also on that second disc is something else it is an optional install that you can do that will give you high res it will be a higher resolution texture pack so it will make the game look prettier if you want to install it to your hard drive

1257
01:33:50,797 --> 01:33:51,738
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's kind of neat, actually.

1258
01:33:51,778 --> 01:33:52,519
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's kind of cool.

1259
01:33:52,659 --> 01:33:53,680
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really smart.

1260
01:33:54,401 --> 01:33:57,083
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe that'll make things look a little bit better.

1261
01:33:58,305 --> 01:34:07,454
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm assuming it'll probably be pretty much the same as PlayStation 3, since obviously blue-gray discs have a lot more storage space, but that is kind of cool.

1262
01:34:09,491 --> 01:34:10,332
[SPEAKER_02]: VVVVVV on the 3DS VVVVVV on the 3DS

1263
01:34:37,789 --> 01:35:06,896
[SPEAKER_04]: and it will have some 3D effects now you have to remember VVVVVV is based off of a it's not based off of but it's highly inspired by a Commodore 64 game so that's the style of the graphics so I'm very curious what exactly they're going to 3D ties with this I'm assuming the sprites are in front textures in back I don't know so we'll see what they do with the 3D effects on this also the way they will utilize the double screen is that the bottom touch screen will always show the map

1264
01:35:07,376 --> 01:35:09,458
[SPEAKER_04]: and the top screen will show the game that you're used to.

1265
01:35:09,879 --> 01:35:11,180
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you think that'll look on a 3DS?

1266
01:35:11,661 --> 01:35:20,630
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it'll be cool, but I'm worried though because being that the game is very frustrating and you may want to throw your controller, throwing a 3DS is probably not recommended.

1267
01:35:20,690 --> 01:35:21,411
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a good idea.

1268
01:35:21,951 --> 01:35:25,755
[SPEAKER_04]: They need to put a little attachment on a 3DS that's like a stress squeeze ball.

1269
01:35:25,775 --> 01:35:27,477
[SPEAKER_04]: Something you can squeeze when you get really pissed off.

1270
01:35:29,378 --> 01:35:47,385
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, information about Mario Kart 7, which is exciting, coming out on the 3DS soon Mario Kart 7, the Donkey Kong Returns folks, that's right, Retro Studios Apparently actually helped develop the Donkey Kong Returns themed level in the game, which I think is really cool

1271
01:35:48,326 --> 01:36:08,967
[SPEAKER_04]: so that's some of the stuff they helped with on the game I can see a little bit of the track in here and it looks pretty cool I do like the whole Mario has a different variety of cars and the hang gliders and all that although Loki's not as much of a fan I think it would be kind of cool and I noticed in this one Donkey Kong is riding this giant tractor looking thing which looks funny

1272
01:36:09,571 --> 01:36:10,551
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakra How did that happen?

1273
01:36:39,250 --> 01:36:44,315
[SPEAKER_11]: Disney Trademarks Castle of Illusion, which was an old Genesis game.

1274
01:36:44,976 --> 01:36:46,937
[SPEAKER_11]: But it was Castle of Illusion starring Mickey Mouse.

1275
01:36:47,398 --> 01:36:50,441
[SPEAKER_11]: And it is targeted at the video game software.

1276
01:36:50,521 --> 01:36:52,042
[SPEAKER_11]: So maybe they're going to re-release it.

1277
01:36:52,242 --> 01:36:52,563
[SPEAKER_11]: Who knows?

1278
01:36:52,603 --> 01:36:53,784
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe we get it on a virtual console.

1279
01:36:55,766 --> 01:36:56,967
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, Rock Band.

1280
01:36:57,047 --> 01:37:01,251
[SPEAKER_11]: There is going to be a Facebook milestone celebration with Stevie Wonder.

1281
01:37:01,491 --> 01:37:01,711
[SPEAKER_11]: Ooh.

1282
01:37:02,472 --> 01:37:21,886
[SPEAKER_11]: It's actually since their Facebook page topped 2 million likes, Harmonix is letting the news out and saying the Rock Band 3's DLC is going to be going into... Let's see, we have Stevie Wonder, Coldplay, Breaking Benjamin, and Dream Theater, which having some Dream Theater on there, that's pretty awesome.

1283
01:37:22,526 --> 01:37:26,389
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I know five people who know who Dream Theater is, so that's pretty cool.

1284
01:37:27,390 --> 01:37:28,571
[SPEAKER_11]: And last but never least...

1285
01:37:30,712 --> 01:37:37,480
[SPEAKER_11]: Steven Spielberg and DreamWorks are backing a Halo movie to come out in 2012.

1286
01:37:37,640 --> 01:37:39,222
[SPEAKER_02]: That is false.

1287
01:37:40,723 --> 01:37:41,985
[SPEAKER_11]: And let me finish.

1288
01:37:43,466 --> 01:37:45,448
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for getting in on my damn story.

1289
01:37:47,725 --> 01:37:53,052
[SPEAKER_11]: It was stated to Microsoft denied that it was in development.

1290
01:37:53,132 --> 01:37:59,160
[SPEAKER_11]: They go on record saying that it is inaccurate and they have no plan for Halo feature right now.

1291
01:37:59,281 --> 01:38:02,124
[SPEAKER_11]: Their focus is developing Halo Anniversary and Halo 4.

1292
01:38:02,685 --> 01:38:04,027
[SPEAKER_04]: We all know it's going to happen eventually though.

1293
01:38:04,963 --> 01:38:06,584
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean... Someday!

1294
01:38:06,944 --> 01:38:07,584
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be terrible.

1295
01:38:08,264 --> 01:38:15,587
[SPEAKER_04]: But then again, you know, I've talked a lot about the WoW movie before, and the World of Warcraft movie, I don't think that's ever going to happen at this point.

1296
01:38:16,227 --> 01:38:18,728
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they missed their chance a couple years ago.

1297
01:38:18,748 --> 01:38:20,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank God, because that sounds like a terrible idea.

1298
01:38:20,628 --> 01:38:23,089
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it could have been good, but it probably wouldn't have been.

1299
01:38:23,349 --> 01:38:23,769
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1300
01:38:23,889 --> 01:38:24,730
[SPEAKER_04]: We all know it wouldn't have been.

1301
01:38:25,450 --> 01:38:26,451
[SPEAKER_04]: It would have been terrible.

1302
01:38:26,691 --> 01:38:26,911
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, 000-123456?

1303
01:38:26,931 --> 01:38:27,031
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1304
01:38:27,052 --> 01:38:27,152
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1305
01:38:47,897 --> 01:38:49,637
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what it says on the caller ID.

1306
01:38:50,338 --> 01:38:52,278
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Skype is really funny when it does that.

1307
01:38:52,618 --> 01:38:54,699
[SPEAKER_04]: It shows funny things show up on the caller ID.

1308
01:38:55,139 --> 01:38:56,779
[SPEAKER_04]: So, YYR, how are you doing, sir?

1309
01:38:56,799 --> 01:39:03,140
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I'll be better once I have time to get some sleep.

1310
01:39:03,360 --> 01:39:07,941
[SPEAKER_05]: But I am kind of excited for New York Comic Con later this week.

1311
01:39:08,281 --> 01:39:10,602
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm just...

1312
01:39:11,300 --> 01:39:16,558
[SPEAKER_05]: Doing what I can to get done what I need to do on the two games I'm showing.

1313
01:39:17,119 --> 01:39:18,022
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, so that...

1314
01:39:19,170 --> 01:39:20,771
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't look like complete crap when I'm there.

1315
01:39:21,071 --> 01:39:30,378
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, you've been doing a lot of these conventions and I bet that's been a really good kind of exposure and help for you because, you know, I know you were at PAX East a while ago and I think you did it again.

1316
01:39:30,398 --> 01:39:31,438
[SPEAKER_05]: I've gone to PAX East twice now.

1317
01:39:31,578 --> 01:39:33,860
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and now you've got the Comic Con coming up.

1318
01:39:34,180 --> 01:39:34,961
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty exciting.

1319
01:39:35,821 --> 01:39:47,269
[SPEAKER_05]: It is, and I'll tell you honestly, I haven't gotten a single major gaming site to cover me yet and I'm hoping maybe it'll be different this time, but to be completely honest, I think the major reason I'm doing it is just to

1320
01:39:47,849 --> 01:39:48,569
[SPEAKER_05]: and so on.

1321
01:40:06,517 --> 01:40:08,879
[SPEAKER_05]: Just seeing that is enough for me, to be honest.

1322
01:40:09,079 --> 01:40:10,400
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, pretty much.

1323
01:40:10,740 --> 01:40:13,782
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the first one is the latest available build of Snake 361.

1324
01:40:13,822 --> 01:40:14,102
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1325
01:40:28,698 --> 01:40:30,078
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously the sequel to Snake 360.

1326
01:40:30,899 --> 01:40:34,940
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's a lot of stuff, a lot of stuff that's going to be in the new one.

1327
01:40:35,180 --> 01:40:41,921
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, levels that grow in the campaign, because I got criticized about, well, you know, Snake is a game about avoiding yourself.

1328
01:40:42,041 --> 01:40:47,443
[SPEAKER_05]: And, well, as soon as you get long enough where it's a challenge, the level's done, and then you start over.

1329
01:40:47,703 --> 01:40:52,684
[SPEAKER_05]: So in this game, you know, the campaign has levels that grow as you do.

1330
01:40:53,214 --> 01:40:59,477
[SPEAKER_05]: and then you're challenged to continue going at the length that you're at through a two, three, four, or even more part level.

1331
01:41:00,317 --> 01:41:01,378
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's one thing.

1332
01:41:01,718 --> 01:41:03,999
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there are other things like survival mode.

1333
01:41:04,299 --> 01:41:13,223
[SPEAKER_05]: There's still the traditional one, but then there's a three and five minute score rush where you're going to have to take more risks because you only have that much time.

1334
01:41:13,603 --> 01:41:17,305
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there's something that's really unique and really fun called dual survival.

1335
01:41:17,505 --> 01:41:21,546
[SPEAKER_05]: And the way that works is every time you take a target, you turn around.

1336
01:41:21,746 --> 01:41:22,767
[SPEAKER_05]: You reverse direction.

1337
01:41:23,095 --> 01:41:23,495
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, God.

1338
01:41:23,515 --> 01:41:27,156
[SPEAKER_05]: So you always have to be keeping track of where your head and your tail are.

1339
01:41:27,556 --> 01:41:30,517
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a lot of fun, and it's a really, really great challenge.

1340
01:41:31,298 --> 01:41:39,000
[SPEAKER_04]: I love how you've kind of taken the concept of Snake from the old school cell phones and just turned it into this just complex game in a way.

1341
01:41:39,460 --> 01:41:42,261
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not complex, but you've given it so many more dimensions.

1342
01:41:42,981 --> 01:41:44,302
[SPEAKER_05]: You should see the battle mode now.

1343
01:41:44,322 --> 01:41:46,042
[SPEAKER_05]: There's even more modifiers.

1344
01:41:46,182 --> 01:41:48,623
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to have seven modifiers now.

1345
01:41:49,318 --> 01:41:53,301
[SPEAKER_05]: are available at Comic-Con, and you can turn them all on if you want.

1346
01:41:54,502 --> 01:42:08,433
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just like everything from dead players remaining on the field when you die to, again, reversing direction every time you take a target to the level continuously shrinking.

1347
01:42:09,593 --> 01:42:11,595
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just got a lot of stuff in there.

1348
01:42:12,856 --> 01:42:16,959
[SPEAKER_05]: But one of the new things I'm premiering at Comic-Con is something called the Challenge Mode.

1349
01:42:17,478 --> 01:42:21,021
[SPEAKER_05]: Eventually there are going to be a hundred different challenges, but at Comic-Con there are just ten.

1350
01:42:21,642 --> 01:42:23,484
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just, you know, a scenario.

1351
01:42:23,884 --> 01:42:31,951
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, you're here, you're in this level, you have to do this, you have this much time, you have this many movements, here are the restrictions, okay, go.

1352
01:42:32,632 --> 01:42:34,453
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm also going to have a contest.

1353
01:42:34,513 --> 01:42:41,019
[SPEAKER_05]: If there's anybody who can clear the four hardest challenges that I bring with me in five attempts, they can win a year of live.

1354
01:42:41,400 --> 01:42:42,541
[SPEAKER_05]: But to be completely honest...

1355
01:42:43,203 --> 01:42:44,764
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think anyone's going to be able to do it.

1356
01:42:44,784 --> 01:42:46,125
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, you're throwing down the gauntlet.

1357
01:42:46,385 --> 01:42:47,025
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1358
01:42:47,145 --> 01:42:47,486
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

1359
01:42:47,746 --> 01:42:52,508
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if someone thinks they can come prove me wrong, then they're quite welcome.

1360
01:42:52,789 --> 01:42:53,029
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

1361
01:42:53,249 --> 01:42:54,930
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, YYR is live with us.

1362
01:42:54,970 --> 01:43:01,273
[SPEAKER_04]: This isn't a prerecorded thing, so if you have questions in our chat room, go ahead and ask them, chat.orangelongeradio.com.

1363
01:43:01,474 --> 01:43:04,395
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you're really excited about Snake 361, and so are we.

1364
01:43:04,675 --> 01:43:08,858
[SPEAKER_04]: It's looking to be a great game, but I got to tell you, I want to talk about project number two.

1365
01:43:08,878 --> 01:43:09,778
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1366
01:43:11,239 --> 01:43:13,701
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know what, the seeds for Project No.

1367
01:43:13,901 --> 01:43:16,502
[SPEAKER_05]: 2 were planted a long time ago.

1368
01:43:18,463 --> 01:43:38,295
[SPEAKER_05]: If you can recall, shortly after Sneak360 came out, and I talked about it right here on OLR, one of the weeks immediately after that, you guys were throwing around some ideas, and it's funny, I don't have the chat log, but I do distinctly remember that someone was like, hey, YYR, get on that.

1369
01:43:39,015 --> 01:43:40,096
[SPEAKER_05]: And at the time, I didn't.

1370
01:43:40,712 --> 01:43:45,773
[SPEAKER_05]: But I was just thinking about it, and sometime this summer I said, you know what?

1371
01:43:46,433 --> 01:43:47,513
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I'm going to get on it.

1372
01:43:48,394 --> 01:44:03,817
[SPEAKER_05]: So I threw together a trailer last night that kind of brings back something about... Basically, I have your discussion in there, and...

1373
01:44:05,006 --> 01:44:07,707
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, really the trailer speaks for itself.

1374
01:44:07,767 --> 01:44:09,188
[SPEAKER_05]: It speaks better than I ever could.

1375
01:44:10,589 --> 01:44:11,689
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't we take it away then?

1376
01:44:11,949 --> 01:44:17,612
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to play this here in studio, the trailer, and I think you're going to link it for our chatters if they want to see it.

1377
01:44:17,792 --> 01:44:22,734
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought originally this was YouTube, but it's not, so we'll figure out a way to get it on Tumblr for the podcast.

1378
01:44:22,774 --> 01:44:28,697
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll tell you something, it's a direct link to an MP4 download on my site.

1379
01:44:28,837 --> 01:44:30,038
[SPEAKER_05]: To be honest...

1380
01:44:30,851 --> 01:44:36,034
[SPEAKER_05]: Most people, when they click on it, either it'll just play or they'll be able to download it to their desktop.

1381
01:44:36,054 --> 01:44:40,977
[SPEAKER_05]: There'll be a very, very, very brief delay while it downloads because it's not very big, and then it'll play.

1382
01:44:42,898 --> 01:44:47,661
[SPEAKER_05]: For most people, and of course MP4 is a format that pretty much everybody can play.

1383
01:44:49,077 --> 01:45:15,227
[SPEAKER_04]: Most phones even should be able to handle it Alright, we'll get it on the Tumblr And I'm sure people can figure it out We got smart listeners So here it is The world premiere of the secret project That YYR has been working on That apparently we have had a hand in unknowingly So here we go Let's start off here Of course now I just have to wait for the buffering I just put the link in chat I just have to wait for the buffering now I should have loaded this in advance Yeah, Rob Shame on me

1384
01:45:16,462 --> 01:45:16,902
[SPEAKER_04]: Good job.

1385
01:45:17,543 --> 01:45:18,303
[SPEAKER_04]: You live, you learn.

1386
01:45:18,323 --> 01:45:20,645
[SPEAKER_04]: This would have been a great time to talk about more.

1387
01:45:20,685 --> 01:45:23,487
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you doing any other live appearances this year besides New York Comic Con?

1388
01:45:24,408 --> 01:45:26,970
[SPEAKER_05]: Next after this is going to be MAGFest in January.

1389
01:45:27,631 --> 01:45:27,951
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1390
01:45:28,071 --> 01:45:28,932
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is in the D.C.

1391
01:45:29,032 --> 01:45:29,372
[SPEAKER_05]: area.

1392
01:45:29,612 --> 01:45:35,757
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just one big orgasm of gaming and music and gaming-related music.

1393
01:45:35,817 --> 01:45:37,038
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just amazing.

1394
01:45:37,338 --> 01:45:37,618
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on.

1395
01:45:37,698 --> 01:45:38,059
[SPEAKER_04]: It loaded.

1396
01:45:38,139 --> 01:45:38,479
[SPEAKER_04]: It loaded.

1397
01:45:38,499 --> 01:45:39,059
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got to play it.

1398
01:45:39,099 --> 01:45:41,261
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never seen so many video games in a room before.

1399
01:45:41,481 --> 01:45:41,902
[SPEAKER_04]: It loaded.

1400
01:45:41,942 --> 01:45:42,362
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.

1401
01:45:42,382 --> 01:45:42,942
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1402
01:45:46,089 --> 01:45:46,529
[SPEAKER_04]: on the DS.

1403
01:45:47,130 --> 01:45:47,530
[SPEAKER_11]: Ferret!

1404
01:45:49,051 --> 01:45:51,192
[SPEAKER_11]: Return the ferret, I command thee.

1405
01:45:51,272 --> 01:45:52,893
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to put it like on a bungee cord.

1406
01:45:52,913 --> 01:45:56,455
[SPEAKER_04]: You do need to put it on a bungee cord so every time you throw it, you can yank it back.

1407
01:45:57,216 --> 01:45:57,856
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a bungee ferret.

1408
01:45:57,876 --> 01:45:59,577
[SPEAKER_04]: Not that I should be encouraging you to do this.

1409
01:46:00,258 --> 01:46:01,658
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, you know what they need to do?

1410
01:46:02,179 --> 01:46:09,523
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, since we've been talking community games and all this stuff and all this good Xbox Live thing, shouldn't they have a game called Bungee Ferret Tossing?

1411
01:46:10,324 --> 01:46:12,745
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be like Orange Lounge Radio presents Bungee Ferret Tossing.

1412
01:46:12,825 --> 01:46:15,467
[SPEAKER_11]: Add this to the list of Orange Lounge Radio dream games.

1413
01:46:15,687 --> 01:46:15,747
[SPEAKER_11]: Or...

1414
01:46:16,107 --> 01:46:19,349
[SPEAKER_04]: No, add this to the list of Orange Launch Radio reality games.

1415
01:46:19,489 --> 01:46:21,470
[SPEAKER_11]: We need to tell Becky about the dream games.

1416
01:46:21,490 --> 01:46:23,811
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to learn how to program or something.

1417
01:46:23,851 --> 01:46:26,012
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a series of games that we're developing.

1418
01:46:26,032 --> 01:46:26,873
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, you're in school.

1419
01:46:26,913 --> 01:46:27,933
[SPEAKER_04]: Take a class on programming.

1420
01:46:34,096 --> 01:46:38,018
[SPEAKER_04]: Our ferret engineers have created time ferrets with a two-second fuse.

1421
01:46:38,339 --> 01:46:39,059
[SPEAKER_11]: This is great.

1422
01:46:41,727 --> 01:47:09,241
[SPEAKER_04]: and you've got a guy dangling from a helicopter and he is throwing ferrets that explode that explode in bloody messes on the unsuspecting people below who are shooting at you who are shooting missiles at you while you fly around it is bungee ferret tossing inspired by OLR for better or worse it will be playable at New York Comic Con coming to Xbox 360 later this year from I guess a new division that you're working with MRG

1423
01:47:10,757 --> 01:47:29,403
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, well, it's, you know what, I came up with an alternate name, MRG, Mostly Random Games, and, because basically, like, my label, YYR Games, has always been about just straight-up serious arcade-style games, and, well, this is anything but serious, so, I wanted to just separate it slightly.

1424
01:47:29,663 --> 01:47:30,984
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand, I understand.

1425
01:47:32,096 --> 01:47:33,437
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm having so much fun with this.

1426
01:47:33,917 --> 01:47:36,559
[SPEAKER_05]: And everyone who's tried it so far really loves the concept.

1427
01:47:36,619 --> 01:47:41,902
[SPEAKER_05]: And to be completely honest, the graphics, as with my other games, they're nothing special.

1428
01:47:42,022 --> 01:47:46,805
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm considering having a lot of them redrawn by someone a little more professional than me.

1429
01:47:46,905 --> 01:47:51,727
[SPEAKER_05]: But everyone who's tried it so far, they really like the way it plays.

1430
01:47:51,747 --> 01:47:57,010
[SPEAKER_05]: Because basically the thing is, you're fighting terrorism, as we all should be doing.

1431
01:47:57,871 --> 01:47:59,872
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course the terrorists have to fight terrorism.

1432
01:47:59,932 --> 01:48:01,233
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to make you a flyer.

1433
01:48:04,177 --> 01:48:06,079
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got New York Comic Con coming up Friday, you should.

1434
01:48:07,881 --> 01:48:17,552
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually have something in the printer, and by the way, there's a big red box on it that says, you know, the concept of bungee-throwing is a joke, never throw an animal in real life.

1435
01:48:18,233 --> 01:48:19,735
[SPEAKER_04]: That's good, you don't want PETA on your ass.

1436
01:48:19,815 --> 01:48:22,318
[SPEAKER_11]: Unless you throw Shermie, who'll just land with a splat.

1437
01:48:23,239 --> 01:48:24,220
[SPEAKER_11]: She's too heavy to throw.

1438
01:48:25,069 --> 01:48:32,034
[SPEAKER_05]: Although, to be completely honest, I wouldn't be 100% sad if PETA was on my ass because they say any publicity is good publicity, right?

1439
01:48:32,094 --> 01:48:32,595
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.

1440
01:48:32,795 --> 01:48:34,256
[SPEAKER_04]: So what are you controlling in the game?

1441
01:48:34,296 --> 01:48:35,637
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you controlling the helicopter?

1442
01:48:36,498 --> 01:48:46,305
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, this is a great example, I think, of a game that would not be possible in its current form on a smartphone or on something that doesn't have, you know, thumbsticks and buttons.

1443
01:48:46,646 --> 01:48:49,348
[SPEAKER_05]: This is going to be, I think, a great, you know...

1444
01:48:50,089 --> 01:48:54,891
[SPEAKER_05]: Peace of Ammo in the War on, you know, oh, well, cell phones can do everything.

1445
01:48:54,991 --> 01:48:56,631
[SPEAKER_05]: Smart phones can do all kinds of games.

1446
01:48:56,971 --> 01:49:07,295
[SPEAKER_05]: Because basically, the way this game works is using the left thumbstick, you control the helicopter's movement, and using the right thumbstick, you can control the guy, you know, the dude, I call him,

1447
01:49:07,694 --> 01:49:09,195
[SPEAKER_05]: Hang on the end of the helicopter.

1448
01:49:09,576 --> 01:49:12,779
[SPEAKER_05]: If you push the right stick up and down, you can control the chord length.

1449
01:49:12,859 --> 01:49:13,619
[SPEAKER_05]: Doesn't Dude need a name?

1450
01:49:13,639 --> 01:49:15,101
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you push left and right, you can swing.

1451
01:49:15,301 --> 01:49:16,722
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, we need to give Dude a name.

1452
01:49:17,223 --> 01:49:18,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, the hero needs a name.

1453
01:49:18,924 --> 01:49:19,405
[SPEAKER_09]: Fernando.

1454
01:49:20,906 --> 01:49:22,147
[SPEAKER_04]: Fernando, sure, okay.

1455
01:49:22,167 --> 01:49:23,729
[SPEAKER_04]: Fernando, like the ABBA song?

1456
01:49:23,889 --> 01:49:24,169
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1457
01:49:26,011 --> 01:49:27,612
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you hear the drums, Fernando?

1458
01:49:27,752 --> 01:49:29,133
[SPEAKER_04]: His name is Fernando ABBA.

1459
01:49:29,434 --> 01:49:30,935
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess we named your guy Fernando.

1460
01:49:31,496 --> 01:49:32,516
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I'm writing it down.

1461
01:49:33,617 --> 01:49:36,338
[SPEAKER_05]: I have SSJ100 Matt here with me, actually.

1462
01:49:37,298 --> 01:49:39,539
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a little surprised that I'm writing it down, but you know what?

1463
01:49:39,559 --> 01:49:40,259
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to forget it.

1464
01:49:41,579 --> 01:49:43,040
[SPEAKER_04]: How could you forget an ABBA song?

1465
01:49:43,280 --> 01:49:43,920
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just kidding.

1466
01:49:44,320 --> 01:49:46,521
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I got so much stuff.

1467
01:49:46,681 --> 01:49:50,322
[SPEAKER_05]: I started the day with no music and sound effects in the game.

1468
01:49:50,362 --> 01:49:51,922
[SPEAKER_05]: Now they're all done and I have to put them in.

1469
01:49:54,643 --> 01:49:55,823
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been busy.

1470
01:49:56,103 --> 01:49:59,904
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyway, Fernando here, he's fighting terrorists.

1471
01:50:00,164 --> 01:50:02,485
[SPEAKER_05]: We discover the location of their base in the desert.

1472
01:50:02,918 --> 01:50:07,983
[SPEAKER_05]: but the thing is they have advanced stealth radar detection technology so we can't send in the army.

1473
01:50:08,363 --> 01:50:15,110
[SPEAKER_05]: So instead we send in one stealth helicopter and Fernando, who is armed with the latest in ferret weapons technology.

1474
01:50:15,450 --> 01:50:18,914
[SPEAKER_05]: Now you know how they have in movies, they have like, oh let's show the schematics.

1475
01:50:19,294 --> 01:50:27,402
[SPEAKER_05]: And you get this screen with like a green grid and on top there's some kind of wireframe image of some, you know, complicated technology.

1476
01:50:28,425 --> 01:50:34,828
[SPEAKER_05]: In the opening sequence, when it's eventually done, you're going to see that, except it's just going to be ferret dynamite.

1477
01:50:38,290 --> 01:50:38,770
[SPEAKER_10]: That is amazing.

1478
01:50:38,790 --> 01:50:40,391
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the ferret weapons technology.

1479
01:50:41,031 --> 01:50:49,575
[SPEAKER_05]: And then at the end of the game, you realize that the terrorists have somehow reverse-engineered the ferret weapons technology in their attempt to use it on you.

1480
01:50:49,815 --> 01:50:55,318
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's an exciting little thing waiting for you at the end of the game.

1481
01:50:55,876 --> 01:51:11,148
[SPEAKER_05]: Although there may be, depending on time, an alternate boss at the end of hard mode that actually Matt here came up with, and it's just as ridiculous as the game concept itself, and hopefully I can get that in there so you all can laugh at it.

1482
01:51:11,434 --> 01:51:16,099
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I gotta say, I am just like... Is it Shermie's fat butt?

1483
01:51:16,960 --> 01:51:20,143
[SPEAKER_04]: On behalf of all of us, I'm just like, I'm like... I'm tickled.

1484
01:51:20,163 --> 01:51:20,884
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously.

1485
01:51:21,284 --> 01:51:23,106
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think tickled is the right word.

1486
01:51:23,206 --> 01:51:29,152
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, just tickled that one of our dream game ideas is fucking happening!

1487
01:51:29,352 --> 01:51:29,873
[SPEAKER_13]: I know!

1488
01:51:31,494 --> 01:51:32,415
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's all you, buddy.

1489
01:51:32,455 --> 01:51:34,736
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not going to sue you over using our ID or whatever.

1490
01:51:34,776 --> 01:51:36,457
[SPEAKER_04]: We say you earned the money, so keep it.

1491
01:51:36,517 --> 01:51:38,138
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not going to chase after you.

1492
01:51:38,178 --> 01:51:41,580
[SPEAKER_04]: We know you're going to plug us somewhere, and it's all good.

1493
01:51:42,020 --> 01:51:44,361
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to share it with Dynamite.

1494
01:51:44,701 --> 01:51:45,542
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be your biggest game yet.

1495
01:51:45,562 --> 01:51:52,785
[SPEAKER_05]: So far, I haven't really seen a whole lot of money from the dollar games I put out, but if I do see any volume of money, at the very least, I'll make a trip out there, and I'll buy you guys a beer.

1496
01:51:54,186 --> 01:51:54,527
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes!

1497
01:51:54,607 --> 01:51:55,708
[SPEAKER_04]: Now hold on.

1498
01:51:55,988 --> 01:51:56,910
[SPEAKER_10]: I love beer.

1499
01:51:56,990 --> 01:51:58,151
[SPEAKER_04]: We only drink hard liquor.

1500
01:51:58,171 --> 01:51:59,933
[SPEAKER_04]: At least I... I drink good beer.

1501
01:52:00,193 --> 01:52:01,354
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't drank in six months.

1502
01:52:01,414 --> 01:52:02,315
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll buy Jamie a beer.

1503
01:52:02,356 --> 01:52:03,497
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll get you something harder.

1504
01:52:05,415 --> 01:52:08,076
[SPEAKER_11]: Rob would like a root beer float.

1505
01:52:08,616 --> 01:52:09,556
[SPEAKER_04]: Virgin pina colada.

1506
01:52:10,357 --> 01:52:11,877
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki would like ten shots of tequila.

1507
01:52:11,917 --> 01:52:13,158
[SPEAKER_04]: The trailer is out there.

1508
01:52:13,338 --> 01:52:15,559
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to post the link to our Tumblr as well.

1509
01:52:16,479 --> 01:52:20,501
[SPEAKER_04]: Our chatters are just do want OMG XD.

1510
01:52:20,941 --> 01:52:22,241
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd buy that for a dollar.

1511
01:52:22,501 --> 01:52:23,662
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you determined the price yet?

1512
01:52:25,218 --> 01:52:52,855
[SPEAKER_04]: it will be a dollar a dollar okay so like seriously guys it's a whole dollar and you always have those leftover points anyway for when you buy the big points and buy rock band songs I have a dollar left over actually alright I can pay a dollar for Bungie Ferrets so I am legit excited any idea on a release time frame or too soon to tell you're just kind of demoing it right now I am going to be rushing my butt off to have it out by the end of the year beyond that

1513
01:52:53,804 --> 01:52:56,165
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have an absolute clue.

1514
01:52:56,245 --> 01:53:02,167
[SPEAKER_05]: However, you can know for certain that I will be here letting you know when that is.

1515
01:53:02,707 --> 01:53:03,267
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

1516
01:53:03,307 --> 01:53:07,129
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I feel like, you know, OLR and this game are kind of tied together.

1517
01:53:10,210 --> 01:53:10,750
[SPEAKER_04]: We're tickled.

1518
01:53:11,110 --> 01:53:14,331
[SPEAKER_05]: If you listen to OLR, you will know first when it's coming out.

1519
01:53:15,080 --> 01:53:15,380
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1520
01:53:15,600 --> 01:53:16,321
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I like that.

1521
01:53:16,721 --> 01:53:17,022
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

1522
01:53:17,042 --> 01:53:20,945
[SPEAKER_04]: We will take you up on that deal, and we will absolutely be following up with you in future weeks.

1523
01:53:21,285 --> 01:53:25,388
[SPEAKER_04]: Best of luck on programming with the project and all the tireless nights you put in.

1524
01:53:25,648 --> 01:53:27,429
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a kick-ass time in New York Comic Con.

1525
01:53:27,469 --> 01:53:34,695
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish I was going to be there, but I won't, sadly, because I didn't know there was going to be a bunch of fair tossing in there.

1526
01:53:34,995 --> 01:53:36,856
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be at New York Comic Con, definitely.

1527
01:53:36,897 --> 01:53:42,301
[SPEAKER_05]: Stop by and give it a shot and tell me what you think, and give me all your feedback, good, bad, ugly, whatever.

1528
01:53:43,087 --> 01:53:47,737
[SPEAKER_04]: awesome YYR thanks again for coming on the show tonight and we'll be talking to you again soon

1529
01:53:48,513 --> 01:53:49,594
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much for having me.

1530
01:53:49,654 --> 01:53:49,954
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1531
01:53:49,994 --> 01:53:50,815
[SPEAKER_05]: Take care, buddy.

1532
01:53:51,055 --> 01:53:51,355
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1533
01:53:51,515 --> 01:53:51,916
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1534
01:53:52,656 --> 01:53:53,057
[SPEAKER_05]: Take care.

1535
01:53:53,277 --> 01:53:53,637
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye-bye.

1536
01:53:55,319 --> 01:53:57,320
[SPEAKER_04]: YYR and his games.

1537
01:53:57,400 --> 01:54:08,209
[SPEAKER_04]: He's the guy behind such games like Snake 360 and now Snake 361, Falling, and now Bungie Ferret Tossing is going to be awesome.

1538
01:54:09,290 --> 01:54:09,911
[SPEAKER_04]: Looking forward to that.

1539
01:54:10,291 --> 01:54:10,551
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1540
01:54:10,571 --> 01:54:12,473
[SPEAKER_04]: What did you guys think?

1541
01:54:12,893 --> 01:54:13,493
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't that great?

1542
01:54:13,614 --> 01:54:15,375
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the most awesome thing ever.

1543
01:54:17,136 --> 01:54:19,238
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki was convinced it was going to be Grandma's Got Guns.

1544
01:54:19,638 --> 01:54:20,219
[SPEAKER_02]: I was hoping.

1545
01:54:20,399 --> 01:54:22,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe, but here's the thing.

1546
01:54:22,220 --> 01:54:26,584
[SPEAKER_04]: If this game does really well, imagine if it's on the top of the sales board.

1547
01:54:26,664 --> 01:54:31,828
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we have a responsibility to get the word out and make sure that this does top the sales charts.

1548
01:54:32,168 --> 01:54:34,911
[SPEAKER_04]: Then what's going to happen is people are going to be like, wow, this game's going good.

1549
01:54:35,211 --> 01:54:37,993
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, those people at OLR are full of really good ideas.

1550
01:54:38,273 --> 01:54:39,995
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to start adapting some of their other games.

1551
01:54:40,015 --> 01:54:41,856
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to have puzzle sluts.

1552
01:54:42,256 --> 01:54:42,837
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to have...

1553
01:54:44,673 --> 01:54:51,719
[SPEAKER_04]: BlowShitUp, they're all on the wiki that's out there and a lot of times inspired by you guys in chat.

1554
01:54:51,739 --> 01:54:56,903
[SPEAKER_11]: So somebody's updated our wiki to let them know that we've actually got a reality.

1555
01:54:58,084 --> 01:54:59,885
[SPEAKER_11]: We've now had a text-based game.

1556
01:55:00,646 --> 01:55:01,046
[SPEAKER_04]: We did.

1557
01:55:01,306 --> 01:55:06,210
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not the first OLR-inspired game, but this is going to be the first one that you can play on a console.

1558
01:55:08,772 --> 01:55:08,992
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that?

1559
01:55:09,012 --> 01:55:09,753
[SPEAKER_11]: It's going to be awesome.

1560
01:55:09,793 --> 01:55:10,994
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's the first one from our dream list.

1561
01:55:11,014 --> 01:55:12,014
[SPEAKER_04]: It is the first one from our dream list.

1562
01:55:12,435 --> 01:55:16,998
[SPEAKER_04]: So somebody does need to put patent pending YYR on that.

1563
01:55:17,098 --> 01:55:17,218
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1564
01:55:17,238 --> 01:55:21,141
[SPEAKER_04]: Because he has programmed it and we have said we will not sue him, right?

1565
01:55:21,161 --> 01:55:22,302
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not going to sue him over that.

1566
01:55:22,362 --> 01:55:24,783
[SPEAKER_04]: We think it's great that he's running with it.

1567
01:55:26,244 --> 01:55:26,605
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

1568
01:55:26,785 --> 01:55:31,428
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, since you were mentioning games and making stuff, I thought it was kind of cool.

1569
01:55:31,528 --> 01:55:33,289
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually checked out there is this –

1570
01:55:35,504 --> 01:55:39,625
[SPEAKER_02]: I happen... There was a link or an article or whatever they got.

1571
01:55:39,905 --> 01:55:40,886
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't make our show roll.

1572
01:55:41,206 --> 01:55:44,627
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about the new Milo Pony thing.

1573
01:55:44,987 --> 01:55:46,467
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a fighting game that someone's making.

1574
01:55:46,627 --> 01:55:46,967
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

1575
01:55:47,027 --> 01:55:47,567
[SPEAKER_04]: I heard about this.

1576
01:55:47,627 --> 01:55:47,908
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1577
01:55:48,128 --> 01:55:48,368
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1578
01:55:48,628 --> 01:55:54,629
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they're using the old... It's a 2D fighter maker, I guess.

1579
01:55:54,990 --> 01:55:56,450
[SPEAKER_02]: By the same people that did RPG Maker.

1580
01:55:56,810 --> 01:55:57,651
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1581
01:56:12,205 --> 01:56:20,075
[SPEAKER_02]: Android and iOS support, so you'll be able to publish your own games, your own iPod games without any programming knowledge.

1582
01:56:21,336 --> 01:56:21,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

1583
01:56:22,518 --> 01:56:23,218
[SPEAKER_02]: Wouldn't that be fun?

1584
01:56:23,799 --> 01:56:24,260
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, boy.

1585
01:56:24,620 --> 01:56:25,902
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki's eyes are lighting up.

1586
01:56:26,583 --> 01:56:27,163
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1587
01:56:28,404 --> 01:56:28,804
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

1588
01:56:29,504 --> 01:56:29,764
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1589
01:56:29,804 --> 01:56:32,305
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we'll keep you guys posted on that.

1590
01:56:32,765 --> 01:56:43,347
[SPEAKER_04]: I just, man, I just, this show going into its 10th year next year, it's like now we have, we've won a podcast award, you know, even though it was some time ago, we've got nominated again.

1591
01:56:43,948 --> 01:56:47,048
[SPEAKER_04]: We've had a PC game, a text-based adventure written on us.

1592
01:56:47,088 --> 01:56:49,689
[SPEAKER_04]: And now we have like an actual like console graphical thing, like a

1593
01:56:51,090 --> 01:56:55,877
[SPEAKER_04]: for lack of a better term, a legit thing you're going to be able to buy on your console that's inspired by our show.

1594
01:56:55,957 --> 01:56:57,118
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just amazing.

1595
01:56:57,258 --> 01:56:59,101
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like the ultimate compliment.

1596
01:56:59,742 --> 01:57:00,783
[SPEAKER_04]: For real.

1597
01:57:01,844 --> 01:57:02,345
[SPEAKER_04]: So excited.

1598
01:57:03,587 --> 01:57:07,011
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I don't know how we follow this with more gaming news, but that's what we're going to do.

1599
01:57:07,131 --> 01:57:08,113
[SPEAKER_04]: So Loki, good luck.

1600
01:57:08,693 --> 01:57:12,375
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, I'll try to make it significant.

1601
01:57:13,015 --> 01:57:22,200
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's an interesting patent that Microsoft is working or has right now that points to possible Kinect-based parental controls.

1602
01:57:22,821 --> 01:57:32,546
[SPEAKER_02]: And what it's going to do is it's actually going to look at your proportion, tracking your body skeleton, that kind of stuff, to figure out what age you were probably.

1603
01:57:33,506 --> 01:57:35,187
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to take a best guess, I guess.

1604
01:57:35,207 --> 01:57:36,048
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1605
01:57:37,229 --> 01:58:03,623
[SPEAKER_02]: um neat idea i guess but i see a ton of flaws with this one uh couldn't a child simply unplug the connect and boom problem solved no need for uh parental controls whatsoever and the only way this would really work is if it's actually physically built into the console um and then the other thing is what about the short people or you know

1606
01:58:05,146 --> 01:58:06,167
[SPEAKER_02]: Midgets, if you will.

1607
01:58:06,808 --> 01:58:07,469
[SPEAKER_02]: What about them?

1608
01:58:07,990 --> 01:58:08,751
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not good.

1609
01:58:09,832 --> 01:58:11,775
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1610
01:58:11,815 --> 01:58:16,080
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't think anything's going to happen with this, but it's a neat concept, I guess.

1611
01:58:18,038 --> 01:58:25,324
[SPEAKER_02]: And once again, it really comes down to are parents going to set up these parental controls in the first place?

1612
01:58:26,505 --> 01:58:26,885
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably not.

1613
01:58:28,286 --> 01:58:28,746
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.

1614
01:58:28,786 --> 01:58:30,568
[SPEAKER_04]: It's probably going to be more complex to set up.

1615
01:58:30,608 --> 01:58:37,533
[SPEAKER_04]: But this discriminates against midgets because it's going to scan a little person and it's going to think it's a child and say, no porn for you.

1616
01:58:40,154 --> 01:58:40,755
[SPEAKER_02]: That is sad.

1617
01:58:40,835 --> 01:58:48,802
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, this is one of those things that's like, I guess it's an interesting idea, but at the end of the day, it's also kind of dumb because you know what parental control you should have in your house at all times?

1618
01:58:49,302 --> 01:58:49,943
[SPEAKER_04]: A parent!

1619
01:58:51,785 --> 01:58:52,686
[SPEAKER_11]: It is a parent, isn't it?

1620
01:58:54,467 --> 01:58:56,529
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it is very apparent that you should have a parent.

1621
01:58:57,370 --> 01:58:57,810
[SPEAKER_11]: Ha!

1622
01:58:59,532 --> 01:59:00,873
[SPEAKER_11]: Unless you were me as a child.

1623
01:59:01,353 --> 01:59:02,374
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, moving on.

1624
01:59:03,396 --> 01:59:04,256
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want to move on.

1625
01:59:05,177 --> 01:59:05,917
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't have to move on.

1626
01:59:05,937 --> 01:59:08,338
[SPEAKER_11]: Why do we always have to... Fine!

1627
01:59:08,798 --> 01:59:09,699
[SPEAKER_04]: How about Minecraft shit?

1628
01:59:09,719 --> 01:59:10,759
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just going to stop.

1629
01:59:11,019 --> 01:59:11,740
[SPEAKER_04]: How's that sound?

1630
01:59:11,980 --> 01:59:12,960
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll just stop.

1631
01:59:13,080 --> 01:59:14,901
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we're not ready for Minecraft shit, are we?

1632
01:59:15,221 --> 01:59:15,481
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1633
01:59:15,721 --> 01:59:16,242
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we're not.

1634
01:59:16,262 --> 01:59:17,482
[SPEAKER_04]: We haven't even done Mailbag yet.

1635
01:59:18,082 --> 01:59:18,703
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, damn.

1636
01:59:19,703 --> 01:59:20,223
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at you.

1637
01:59:20,504 --> 01:59:21,584
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at you trying to cheat.

1638
01:59:21,684 --> 01:59:24,105
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, a reminder.

1639
01:59:24,125 --> 01:59:27,647
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you see the ad for the show where every gamer has a voice?

1640
01:59:27,727 --> 01:59:28,287
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, well...

1641
01:59:31,360 --> 01:59:32,200
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, a voice.

1642
01:59:32,461 --> 01:59:34,361
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no voices in a mailbag.

1643
01:59:34,421 --> 01:59:35,222
[SPEAKER_02]: It's text.

1644
01:59:35,622 --> 01:59:37,703
[SPEAKER_02]: You gotta leave a message if you want a voice.

1645
01:59:37,883 --> 01:59:40,804
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this is a little bit too late, I think.

1646
01:59:40,884 --> 01:59:41,424
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't know.

1647
01:59:41,444 --> 01:59:42,405
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to share this anyway.

1648
01:59:42,745 --> 01:59:53,169
[SPEAKER_04]: But, okay, you guys heard about the whole thing where Sony and EA, they updated their terms of service so that you can't take them to a class action lawsuit anymore.

1649
01:59:53,189 --> 01:59:57,031
[SPEAKER_04]: And the only way you could get out of the class action lawsuit was to send a letter.

1650
01:59:57,751 --> 02:00:06,611
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there's a website that was created called Gamers Opt Out which was basically a site that you could fill in information online and they would send it in for you.

1651
02:00:08,197 --> 02:00:08,677
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

1652
02:00:09,338 --> 02:00:11,499
[SPEAKER_04]: So, hmm.

1653
02:00:11,919 --> 02:00:19,524
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess there was some concern at first that a legal person had registered this website, but it turned out after some investigation it's not.

1654
02:00:19,564 --> 02:00:24,007
[SPEAKER_04]: It's some dude up in Michigan who's just really mad about this, like a lot of people are, really.

1655
02:00:24,387 --> 02:00:25,908
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a pretty interesting concept.

1656
02:00:25,948 --> 02:00:32,211
[SPEAKER_04]: The only bummer is that Sony term of service thing happened already like six weeks ago at this point, wasn't it?

1657
02:00:32,492 --> 02:00:33,372
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on.

1658
02:00:34,953 --> 02:00:38,396
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it happened, but that is only if you've agreed to it.

1659
02:00:38,536 --> 02:00:41,578
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can only agree to it if you've updated your system.

1660
02:00:41,658 --> 02:00:45,020
[SPEAKER_02]: If you haven't updated your system, you haven't made any sort of agreement yet.

1661
02:00:45,280 --> 02:00:47,842
[SPEAKER_04]: I would just assume that most people have done that by now.

1662
02:00:47,882 --> 02:00:51,605
[SPEAKER_04]: But I guess if you haven't, for whatever reason, then you could still use this.

1663
02:00:51,685 --> 02:00:54,166
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I haven't because I haven't played my PlayStation 3 online for ever.

1664
02:00:58,358 --> 02:00:59,499
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's a neat concept.

1665
02:01:00,920 --> 02:01:03,522
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, if somebody's going to do the work for me, I'm all for it.

1666
02:01:03,582 --> 02:01:10,426
[SPEAKER_04]: But at the end of the day, why does Sony get to set all the rules in regards to what you can and can't do legally?

1667
02:01:10,646 --> 02:01:13,908
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I know there's a Supreme Court precedent and all that stuff, but I don't know.

1668
02:01:13,928 --> 02:01:16,010
[SPEAKER_04]: It just kind of seems wrong.

1669
02:01:16,110 --> 02:01:19,852
[SPEAKER_04]: But at the same time, what do class action lawsuits really accomplish either?

1670
02:01:20,472 --> 02:01:24,495
[SPEAKER_04]: Like everybody gets a coupon or everybody gets like 50 cents.

1671
02:01:24,595 --> 02:01:27,377
[SPEAKER_04]: Usually class action lawsuits don't end with much of anything.

1672
02:01:27,992 --> 02:01:36,040
[SPEAKER_04]: So, that's why I'm not as mad about it, but it does kind of... It's more of a principle, I think, at the end of the day.

1673
02:01:36,080 --> 02:01:45,069
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and when does, you know, really, how often do you or I actually file a lawsuit against a company?

1674
02:01:45,109 --> 02:01:45,329
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean...

1675
02:01:46,089 --> 02:01:46,349
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

1676
02:01:46,609 --> 02:01:46,989
[SPEAKER_02]: Never.

1677
02:01:47,529 --> 02:01:47,809
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

1678
02:01:48,070 --> 02:01:50,370
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, sometimes you jump in on class action lawsuits, though.

1679
02:01:50,430 --> 02:01:52,670
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, but that's because you don't really have to do anything.

1680
02:01:52,690 --> 02:01:54,331
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, eh, what's the worst that's going to happen?

1681
02:01:54,351 --> 02:01:57,571
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to lose any money, so might as well, you know, see if I get something.

1682
02:01:58,072 --> 02:02:00,652
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that's really the only reason people jump in on this stuff.

1683
02:02:00,712 --> 02:02:14,535
[SPEAKER_02]: But, I mean, I would think if Sony did something to piss me off, unless they just, you know, sold my house underneath me and, you know, took all my assets or something like that for some sort of weird clause or something that they had.

1684
02:02:15,215 --> 02:02:16,916
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't see myself really suing them.

1685
02:02:16,956 --> 02:02:22,879
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd just be like, well, I'm just not going to buy your next console or game or whatever, you know, that you have.

1686
02:02:26,501 --> 02:02:26,821
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1687
02:02:27,141 --> 02:02:30,003
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we're going to move on to DarkSakura's favorite part of the show.

1688
02:02:30,463 --> 02:02:32,964
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me get her properly riled up for the mailbag.

1689
02:02:34,065 --> 02:02:36,146
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to see this, this picture, DarkSakura.

1690
02:02:37,026 --> 02:02:38,427
[SPEAKER_04]: Miklatov, so you know who to blame.

1691
02:02:38,547 --> 02:02:42,429
[SPEAKER_04]: He sent this to me from Facebook and it was labeled girls version of an Xbox.

1692
02:02:42,489 --> 02:02:42,869
[SPEAKER_04]: You ready?

1693
02:02:42,889 --> 02:02:42,969
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1694
02:02:46,957 --> 02:02:47,857
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a picture of an oven.

1695
02:02:50,838 --> 02:02:51,818
[SPEAKER_04]: She has her finger up.

1696
02:02:57,059 --> 02:03:00,180
[SPEAKER_11]: I only forgive him because he introduced me to that band that I like now.

1697
02:03:00,700 --> 02:03:01,180
[SPEAKER_04]: You mad?

1698
02:03:01,740 --> 02:03:07,722
[SPEAKER_04]: There actually is, I never knew this, on Facebook, there actually is a page called The Girl Version of an Xbox.

1699
02:03:08,602 --> 02:03:09,262
[SPEAKER_11]: That's redonk.

1700
02:03:10,811 --> 02:03:11,671
[SPEAKER_04]: So, email.

1701
02:03:11,771 --> 02:03:12,472
[SPEAKER_04]: First email.

1702
02:03:12,612 --> 02:03:13,172
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on.

1703
02:03:13,192 --> 02:03:14,232
[SPEAKER_04]: We need your theme music.

1704
02:03:15,013 --> 02:03:23,936
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that I have her properly riled up to read your emails at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com Men suck.

1705
02:03:24,916 --> 02:03:26,017
[SPEAKER_04]: It's totally sexist.

1706
02:03:26,057 --> 02:03:26,497
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

1707
02:03:26,797 --> 02:03:27,317
[SPEAKER_04]: It's wrong.

1708
02:03:28,177 --> 02:03:28,878
[SPEAKER_04]: But really funny.

1709
02:03:28,918 --> 02:03:29,138
[SPEAKER_11]: Rob.

1710
02:03:29,498 --> 02:03:29,698
[SPEAKER_11]: Rob.

1711
02:03:29,718 --> 02:03:29,818
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

1712
02:03:29,858 --> 02:03:29,998
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1713
02:03:33,937 --> 02:03:36,478
[SPEAKER_04]: Go play your Xbox in the kitchen

1714
02:03:56,787 --> 02:04:07,636
[SPEAKER_11]: Not only is the battle system fun and has really awesome summons that are actually useful, unlike Final Fantasy XIII, but the game has an emotional musical score and a storyline with compelling character cast.

1715
02:04:08,577 --> 02:04:15,182
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't understand why people complain about the voice of Titus, or even the character itself.

1716
02:04:15,322 --> 02:04:22,568
[SPEAKER_11]: For one thing, I love hearing his narrations and thoughts on how you go through the story, which reminds me of Kion in the Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya.

1717
02:04:23,469 --> 02:04:23,929
[SPEAKER_11]: Kind of.

1718
02:04:24,850 --> 02:04:47,643
[SPEAKER_11]: and for people who have a problem with the character itself he's just being realistic people he asks a lot of questions and gets emotionally stressed because one, he's in a world unknown to him and two, the other characters do keep a lot from him until later in the story and when something as important as a loved one's self-sacrifice it can take quite a toll on someone give Squaresoft a break for having a character we can somewhat relate to geez and this one's directed to me

1719
02:04:48,263 --> 02:04:50,744
[SPEAKER_11]: And Jamie, I completely agree with you on Final Fantasy X too.

1720
02:04:51,105 --> 02:04:55,187
[SPEAKER_11]: The game is just loads of fun and the dress spheres make it really interesting.

1721
02:04:55,547 --> 02:05:07,774
[SPEAKER_11]: In all honesty, if you were a person who loved Final Fantasy Tactics with the different classes and Final Fantasy VII Active Time Battle System, then there is no reason you shouldn't have fun with this game unless you hate Charlie's Angels with all of your being.

1722
02:05:08,254 --> 02:05:10,776
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, A Thousand Words is one of my favorite Final Fantasy songs.

1723
02:05:12,096 --> 02:05:17,420
[SPEAKER_11]: One more note about the Final Fantasy X vs. VII remake argument that people keep on having.

1724
02:05:17,500 --> 02:05:18,261
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's look at it this way.

1725
02:05:18,681 --> 02:05:26,226
[SPEAKER_11]: Final Fantasy VII got a prequel, a cell phone game, a shooter, an anime, a movie, and a special edition of the movie with more scenes.

1726
02:05:26,286 --> 02:05:28,687
[SPEAKER_11]: Final Fantasy X got a sequel, and that's it.

1727
02:05:29,488 --> 02:05:30,689
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's spread the love around, people.

1728
02:05:30,769 --> 02:05:31,890
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for reading, Osfer.

1729
02:05:31,990 --> 02:05:32,290
[SPEAKER_11]: P.S.

1730
02:05:32,330 --> 02:05:33,631
[SPEAKER_11]: Rob, did you ever finish Final Fantasy XIII?

1731
02:05:34,827 --> 02:05:39,231
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm like in the last chapter and I never finished it because I suck.

1732
02:05:39,431 --> 02:05:41,213
[SPEAKER_02]: I keep thinking about doing that too.

1733
02:05:41,293 --> 02:05:44,015
[SPEAKER_04]: I really want to play XIII too, so I think I need to finish.

1734
02:05:44,135 --> 02:05:46,617
[SPEAKER_04]: But at least I know I have until what, like January or February?

1735
02:05:47,238 --> 02:05:50,060
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to hear something funny since I'm going to derail the show right now?

1736
02:05:50,160 --> 02:05:50,340
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

1737
02:05:51,682 --> 02:05:52,782
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to read a book.

1738
02:05:53,443 --> 02:05:53,803
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1739
02:05:54,304 --> 02:05:54,804
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1740
02:05:54,884 --> 02:05:56,325
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like me, we never read books.

1741
02:05:56,366 --> 02:05:59,008
[SPEAKER_02]: What, you can read?

1742
02:05:59,208 --> 02:06:01,450
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, that was my middle finger going up.

1743
02:06:02,579 --> 02:06:02,919
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow!

1744
02:06:03,219 --> 02:06:06,581
[SPEAKER_04]: So in the last five minutes, DarkSakura's finger went up, Loki's finger went up.

1745
02:06:06,982 --> 02:06:09,803
[SPEAKER_04]: Now everybody in chatroom, guess, when's my finger gonna go up?

1746
02:06:09,944 --> 02:06:10,364
[SPEAKER_11]: Right now.

1747
02:06:10,504 --> 02:06:13,226
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's completely appropriate.

1748
02:06:13,246 --> 02:06:14,366
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Ready Player One.

1749
02:06:15,047 --> 02:06:28,636
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically kind of... The way I've... I think the story is like... It's very much like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory meets a bunch of 80s references and a bunch of sci-fi video game references.

1750
02:06:29,036 --> 02:06:31,378
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, this guy has this...

1751
02:06:31,658 --> 02:06:43,082
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of think of it like Second Life, this giant universe cyberspace that people go to and he's going to die, but he's leaving it for the person that finds this key in the thing.

1752
02:06:43,102 --> 02:06:49,204
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this kid from the ghetto or whatever builds this computer and ends up trying to go in there to find the key.

1753
02:06:49,264 --> 02:06:58,727
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's very much like Charlie and the Talking Factory, but there's references to all things like sci-fi and video games and stuff like they've got the

1754
02:06:59,207 --> 02:07:01,148
[SPEAKER_02]: The Owl Ship from Watchmen in there.

1755
02:07:01,268 --> 02:07:02,109
[SPEAKER_02]: The DeLorean.

1756
02:07:02,149 --> 02:07:04,490
[SPEAKER_04]: Could they make a movie out of this?

1757
02:07:04,510 --> 02:07:07,351
[SPEAKER_02]: They are making a movie out of this, I think.

1758
02:07:07,611 --> 02:07:08,192
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds cool.

1759
02:07:08,212 --> 02:07:09,712
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I'm reading it.

1760
02:07:09,732 --> 02:07:13,194
[SPEAKER_10]: It sounds like part of the plot for Spiral.

1761
02:07:14,034 --> 02:07:16,996
[SPEAKER_02]: My wife was very surprised that I would read a book.

1762
02:07:17,296 --> 02:07:19,417
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't read books very often.

1763
02:07:19,497 --> 02:07:22,559
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to read sci-fi books in high school.

1764
02:07:22,579 --> 02:07:22,959
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like me.

1765
02:07:23,460 --> 02:07:25,681
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to read books all the time when I was growing up.

1766
02:07:25,701 --> 02:07:27,182
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to love the scary books.

1767
02:07:28,302 --> 02:07:28,783
[SPEAKER_04]: What was his name?

1768
02:07:28,823 --> 02:07:29,463
[SPEAKER_04]: Christopher Pike?

1769
02:07:29,483 --> 02:07:30,023
[SPEAKER_04]: Goosebumps?

1770
02:07:30,043 --> 02:07:30,624
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that the guy?

1771
02:07:30,764 --> 02:07:31,484
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it was different.

1772
02:07:31,584 --> 02:07:32,305
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, maybe R.L.

1773
02:07:32,325 --> 02:07:32,645
[SPEAKER_04]: Stine?

1774
02:07:32,665 --> 02:07:33,806
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to say Pike.

1775
02:07:34,006 --> 02:07:34,226
[SPEAKER_04]: Pike.

1776
02:07:34,266 --> 02:07:35,767
[SPEAKER_04]: The name Pike is sticking out.

1777
02:07:35,787 --> 02:07:36,607
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, his books.

1778
02:07:36,627 --> 02:07:37,648
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to read a lot of those.

1779
02:07:37,688 --> 02:07:39,449
[SPEAKER_04]: And I read some other stuff too.

1780
02:07:39,629 --> 02:07:41,330
[SPEAKER_11]: You should see the book that I finished in two days.

1781
02:07:41,630 --> 02:07:52,207
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I liked a lot of, even though I hear he was a total asshole, I liked a lot of the Roald Dahl stuff, like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Glass Elevator and James and the Giant Peach and the Boy Who Ruled the World, something like that.

1782
02:07:52,352 --> 02:07:54,573
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, maybe if it's good, I will loan you the book afterwards.

1783
02:07:54,753 --> 02:07:56,935
[SPEAKER_02]: After my wife reads it, because she's supposed to read it.

1784
02:07:57,115 --> 02:08:01,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, hopefully somebody will buy me an iPad so I can play with gadgets when I read books.

1785
02:08:02,438 --> 02:08:04,079
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, it's not that I'm like, reading sucks.

1786
02:08:04,139 --> 02:08:12,063
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just that the internet has kind of like, instead of reading, I pull up Wikipanion on my phone and I'm just looking at Wikipedia articles.

1787
02:08:12,083 --> 02:08:13,224
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of what it's turned into.

1788
02:08:13,804 --> 02:08:15,805
[SPEAKER_04]: My reading is now short attention span theater.

1789
02:08:15,845 --> 02:08:22,528
[SPEAKER_11]: The stuff that I've actually started reading again lately is reading anthropology studies.

1790
02:08:24,829 --> 02:08:28,970
[SPEAKER_11]: I've never been a fan of historical fiction, so I put down one historical fiction I was reading.

1791
02:08:29,951 --> 02:08:34,913
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been reading cultural books.

1792
02:08:35,453 --> 02:08:38,114
[SPEAKER_11]: The book I just finished was Geisha by Liza Dalby.

1793
02:08:38,214 --> 02:08:40,095
[SPEAKER_11]: She actually worked as a geisha in the 70s.

1794
02:08:40,895 --> 02:08:41,776
[SPEAKER_11]: It's her doctoral thesis.

1795
02:08:42,856 --> 02:08:44,657
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's what I've been reading lately.

1796
02:08:44,877 --> 02:08:47,298
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not that I hate reading, I just have a really short attention span.

1797
02:08:47,378 --> 02:08:48,159
[SPEAKER_02]: But apparently it's good.

1798
02:08:48,539 --> 02:08:51,140
[SPEAKER_02]: It is actually on the iOS bookstore or whatever.

1799
02:08:51,280 --> 02:08:55,662
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually on the New York Times bestsellers list right now.

1800
02:08:55,782 --> 02:08:56,703
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

1801
02:08:57,783 --> 02:09:02,486
[SPEAKER_02]: If you like... Kotaku actually was the one that kind of turned me on to that.

1802
02:09:02,806 --> 02:09:02,966
[SPEAKER_02]: They...

1803
02:09:03,426 --> 02:09:06,909
[SPEAKER_02]: Ran an article about the book and with some screen.

1804
02:09:06,929 --> 02:09:13,374
[SPEAKER_02]: It was concept art, I think, for a screenplay because he wrote a screenplay for it as well that will probably become a movie.

1805
02:09:14,093 --> 02:09:15,113
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, and I was wrong.

1806
02:09:15,254 --> 02:09:21,236
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not that it sounds like Spiral, it's that it sounds like the third book, Loop, in the virus, the ring, the ring, Spiral, and Loop.

1807
02:09:21,616 --> 02:09:23,797
[SPEAKER_11]: It sounds kind of like Loop.

1808
02:09:23,917 --> 02:09:25,158
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, but with video game references.

1809
02:09:25,378 --> 02:09:25,598
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1810
02:09:26,338 --> 02:09:26,578
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1811
02:09:26,779 --> 02:09:27,699
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get back to the emails.

1812
02:09:29,460 --> 02:09:29,840
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.

1813
02:09:30,160 --> 02:09:30,420
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1814
02:09:31,321 --> 02:09:32,121
[SPEAKER_11]: The first one's from Holly.

1815
02:09:32,141 --> 02:09:33,782
[SPEAKER_11]: We got two from Holly, but they're short.

1816
02:09:34,402 --> 02:09:35,883
[SPEAKER_11]: Molly says, you were forgiven, PS.

1817
02:09:35,963 --> 02:09:37,463
[SPEAKER_11]: I ate your Xbox connector cables.

1818
02:09:38,324 --> 02:09:38,724
[SPEAKER_11]: What is that?

1819
02:09:39,701 --> 02:09:42,183
[SPEAKER_04]: It was because Loki was talking about the dog, but that was like a month ago.

1820
02:09:42,303 --> 02:09:45,325
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember Loki said something about the dog's gonna die soon or something?

1821
02:09:45,345 --> 02:09:46,446
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, she sent us a picture.

1822
02:09:46,466 --> 02:09:46,966
[SPEAKER_04]: It was really terrible.

1823
02:09:47,126 --> 02:09:48,507
[SPEAKER_11]: She sent us a picture of her dog.

1824
02:09:49,208 --> 02:09:49,968
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I wanna see the dog.

1825
02:09:50,428 --> 02:09:51,249
[SPEAKER_11]: So come on, load.

1826
02:09:51,309 --> 02:09:53,951
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't say the dog would die soon, and I hope it doesn't.

1827
02:09:53,971 --> 02:09:54,611
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just saying.

1828
02:09:55,031 --> 02:09:56,032
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's adorable.

1829
02:09:56,052 --> 02:09:56,853
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's a corgi!

1830
02:09:57,433 --> 02:09:58,694
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, it is adorable.

1831
02:09:58,714 --> 02:09:59,854
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a freaking corgi.

1832
02:09:59,955 --> 02:10:01,856
[SPEAKER_11]: Molly, I'm gonna put your dog on our Tumblr.

1833
02:10:02,416 --> 02:10:04,176
[SPEAKER_04]: That is... I love corgis.

1834
02:10:04,196 --> 02:10:05,217
[SPEAKER_02]: The dog's name is Molly.

1835
02:10:05,997 --> 02:10:06,617
[SPEAKER_11]: I said Holly.

1836
02:10:06,737 --> 02:10:07,337
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay, sorry.

1837
02:10:07,357 --> 02:10:08,157
[SPEAKER_11]: Her name is Molly.

1838
02:10:08,537 --> 02:10:09,417
[SPEAKER_11]: The dog's name is Molly.

1839
02:10:09,877 --> 02:10:10,778
[SPEAKER_11]: I was speaking to Holly.

1840
02:10:10,838 --> 02:10:13,058
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait a minute, it's Holly and... Wait, wait, wait.

1841
02:10:13,098 --> 02:10:14,478
[SPEAKER_04]: For real, it's Holly and Molly?

1842
02:10:15,558 --> 02:10:15,899
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1843
02:10:18,919 --> 02:10:20,379
[SPEAKER_04]: Molly's a good name.

1844
02:10:20,399 --> 02:10:24,800
[SPEAKER_11]: That is the cutest dog ever, so shut the... Corgis are awesome.

1845
02:10:25,020 --> 02:10:26,761
[SPEAKER_04]: No, if I owned a dog, I'd own a corgi.

1846
02:10:27,161 --> 02:10:29,081
[SPEAKER_11]: My favorite gift ever is the army of corgis.

1847
02:10:31,010 --> 02:10:32,531
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, interesting.

1848
02:11:01,546 --> 02:11:03,940
[SPEAKER_04]: Gear and not like pets and things?

1849
02:11:03,980 --> 02:11:04,705
[SPEAKER_04]: That's interesting.

1850
02:11:05,117 --> 02:11:09,859
[SPEAKER_11]: So like six months Sanctuary's Guard, which is a helm.

1851
02:11:11,439 --> 02:11:15,641
[SPEAKER_11]: You get a personal vendor, which we've got one of those in our guild.

1852
02:11:17,621 --> 02:11:19,622
[SPEAKER_11]: You get like some swords.

1853
02:11:19,722 --> 02:11:26,844
[SPEAKER_11]: For 18 months you get gauntlets and greaves and Tricorn of the Drowned.

1854
02:11:27,385 --> 02:11:28,345
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to add to it.

1855
02:11:28,425 --> 02:11:29,005
[SPEAKER_11]: No, whatever.

1856
02:11:29,665 --> 02:11:32,646
[SPEAKER_11]: And you get something called the Endless Skull Helm.

1857
02:11:33,587 --> 02:11:34,427
[SPEAKER_11]: That's just a cool name.

1858
02:11:34,987 --> 02:11:36,307
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, it's like basically all this stuff.

1859
02:11:36,327 --> 02:11:36,768
[SPEAKER_02]: There's an end to it.

1860
02:11:36,788 --> 02:11:38,108
[SPEAKER_02]: That is false advertising.

1861
02:11:38,948 --> 02:11:39,428
Stop.

1862
02:11:41,189 --> 02:11:41,909
[SPEAKER_11]: Moving on.

1863
02:11:42,169 --> 02:11:42,829
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, hold on, hold on.

1864
02:11:42,869 --> 02:11:43,530
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I say this real quick?

1865
02:11:43,810 --> 02:11:46,611
[SPEAKER_04]: WoW does something kind of similar with the whole like anniversary gifts.

1866
02:11:46,731 --> 02:11:49,191
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, but they're not like just for long time subscribers.

1867
02:11:49,371 --> 02:11:49,631
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1868
02:11:50,792 --> 02:11:55,793
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to talk about MMOs real quick though because, and I'm just going to totally publicly talk about a private conversation.

1869
02:11:55,813 --> 02:11:56,293
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even care.

1870
02:11:56,774 --> 02:12:02,175
[SPEAKER_04]: Miklatov, do you know what game he got for free from some little manager thing or whatever?

1871
02:12:02,195 --> 02:12:02,655
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1872
02:12:03,196 --> 02:12:03,916
[SPEAKER_04]: Final Fantasy XIV.

1873
02:12:05,016 --> 02:12:05,256
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

1874
02:12:26,195 --> 02:12:29,999
[SPEAKER_04]: But this is Shane we're talking about and he's really good at making people do things they don't want to do.

1875
02:12:30,159 --> 02:12:30,840
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know.

1876
02:12:30,900 --> 02:12:32,201
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I will have to try it.

1877
02:12:32,741 --> 02:12:33,422
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, hold on.

1878
02:12:33,602 --> 02:12:38,867
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just curious because it's kind of sucked and I'm wondering how much it's going for.

1879
02:12:39,648 --> 02:12:41,870
[SPEAKER_04]: $25 on Amazon if I'm not mistaken.

1880
02:12:42,091 --> 02:12:43,412
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's no monthly fee right now.

1881
02:12:44,491 --> 02:12:44,751
[SPEAKER_09]: Really?

1882
02:12:45,571 --> 02:12:46,032
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Loki.

1883
02:12:46,052 --> 02:12:46,752
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you hear that?

1884
02:12:46,792 --> 02:12:49,112
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki just went, hmm.

1885
02:12:49,232 --> 02:12:49,812
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't.

1886
02:12:49,952 --> 02:12:51,133
[SPEAKER_02]: I seriously, I can't even.

1887
02:12:51,153 --> 02:12:52,573
[SPEAKER_04]: Nikol Tov, you might have won somebody.

1888
02:12:53,053 --> 02:12:54,874
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't even fit in enough game.

1889
02:12:55,194 --> 02:12:56,034
[SPEAKER_11]: This is on eBay.

1890
02:12:56,154 --> 02:12:56,514
[SPEAKER_02]: Shit.

1891
02:12:56,954 --> 02:12:57,974
[SPEAKER_02]: I am looking on eBay.

1892
02:12:58,355 --> 02:12:59,055
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just saying, $12.98.

1893
02:13:00,675 --> 02:13:02,476
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, used.

1894
02:13:02,516 --> 02:13:05,416
[SPEAKER_02]: Why would I buy a used copy of Final Fantasy XIV?

1895
02:13:06,076 --> 02:13:07,077
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just stupid.

1896
02:13:07,757 --> 02:13:08,497
[SPEAKER_02]: But, I mean...

1897
02:13:11,145 --> 02:13:12,268
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I read the next email?

1898
02:13:12,308 --> 02:13:12,991
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, you can.

1899
02:13:13,031 --> 02:13:14,335
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, you brought up MMOs.

1900
02:13:14,395 --> 02:13:14,736
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to.

1901
02:13:17,250 --> 02:13:18,830
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, this one's to me, actually.

1902
02:13:19,150 --> 02:13:20,291
[SPEAKER_11]: I saw this thought of you.

1903
02:13:20,331 --> 02:13:22,772
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe a point for discussion if things are really light this week.

1904
02:13:22,912 --> 02:13:23,272
[SPEAKER_11]: Not really.

1905
02:13:23,712 --> 02:13:29,274
[SPEAKER_11]: The latest top 20 list from some of those lucky people who get paid to sit around all day talking PR crap and getting paid for it.

1906
02:13:29,614 --> 02:13:30,354
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I'm jealous.

1907
02:13:31,014 --> 02:13:39,077
[SPEAKER_11]: The headlines are focusing on the top three, but I was interested by the PlayStation being placed at 13 and Nintendo reaching 16 with the Xbox not featuring.

1908
02:13:39,537 --> 02:13:41,158
[SPEAKER_11]: Is the Xbox really not cool?

1909
02:13:41,258 --> 02:13:42,938
[SPEAKER_11]: Apparently we don't think so in the UK.

1910
02:13:44,199 --> 02:13:44,279
[SPEAKER_11]: Um...

1911
02:13:45,740 --> 02:13:48,624
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, it's never going to stand up to the coolest levels of an Aston.

1912
02:13:48,804 --> 02:13:49,465
[SPEAKER_11]: Haha, true.

1913
02:13:50,046 --> 02:13:50,867
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks, care guys.

1914
02:13:50,927 --> 02:13:51,408
[SPEAKER_11]: Love your work.

1915
02:13:51,568 --> 02:13:51,788
[SPEAKER_11]: Lee.

1916
02:13:52,048 --> 02:13:57,495
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's because they hate the United States so much and Microsoft being a US company and the other two being Japan.

1917
02:13:57,715 --> 02:14:00,719
[SPEAKER_11]: These are the top 20 cool brands and yeah, the Aston Martin is number one.

1918
02:14:01,500 --> 02:14:06,364
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so I'm just going to fly through the list in order, and I can understand these, okay?

1919
02:14:06,884 --> 02:14:21,755
[SPEAKER_11]: So we have Aston Martin as number one, Apple, Harley-Davidson, Rolex, Bang & Olufsen, BlackBerry, Google, Ferrari, Nike, YouTube, Alexander McQueen, the designer, Dom Perignon, PlayStation, Ray-Ban, Chanel.

1920
02:14:21,935 --> 02:14:24,077
[SPEAKER_11]: Why is PlayStation ranked higher than Chanel, fuckers?

1921
02:14:25,458 --> 02:14:26,699
[SPEAKER_11]: Nintendo, Vivian Westwood.

1922
02:14:26,719 --> 02:14:28,020
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes you're a real girl.

1923
02:14:33,495 --> 02:14:44,108
[SPEAKER_11]: Agent Provocateur, Tate Modern, Maserati Maserati's are butt ugly, so yeah Aston Martin number one, Maserati should be like 42 So yeah

1924
02:14:46,755 --> 02:14:47,115
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1925
02:14:47,235 --> 02:14:48,255
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, why?

1926
02:14:48,495 --> 02:14:49,156
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool story.

1927
02:14:49,296 --> 02:14:49,856
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

1928
02:14:50,456 --> 02:14:51,216
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool story, bro.

1929
02:14:51,236 --> 02:14:52,376
[SPEAKER_11]: Maseratis aren't cool.

1930
02:14:52,856 --> 02:14:55,017
[SPEAKER_11]: You want cool on there, put a fucking Bugatti on there.

1931
02:14:55,177 --> 02:14:55,857
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what's cool.

1932
02:14:57,017 --> 02:14:59,078
[SPEAKER_11]: And Chanel should be right behind Aston Martin.

1933
02:14:59,538 --> 02:15:03,199
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I'm sorry, imagine decked out in Chanel driving an Aston Martin.

1934
02:15:05,920 --> 02:15:06,560
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to do that.

1935
02:15:06,580 --> 02:15:06,860
[SPEAKER_02]: With an iPad.

1936
02:15:07,560 --> 02:15:08,340
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm talking me.

1937
02:15:10,401 --> 02:15:10,981
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be epic.

1938
02:15:12,393 --> 02:15:13,514
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's move on.

1939
02:15:13,534 --> 02:15:14,355
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, we got more emails.

1940
02:15:15,356 --> 02:15:16,296
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1941
02:15:16,336 --> 02:15:17,718
[SPEAKER_02]: Very feminine James Bond.

1942
02:15:19,819 --> 02:15:20,820
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, this comes from Zether.

1943
02:15:21,941 --> 02:15:27,826
[SPEAKER_11]: Zether is actually my new buddy now for introducing me to a different PC Engine thingy.

1944
02:15:28,328 --> 02:15:36,032
[SPEAKER_11]: So I listened to episode 428 recently, and near the end DarkSakura was talking about the PC Engine and TurboGrafx-16 emulation, and mentioned Magic Engine.

1945
02:15:36,472 --> 02:15:40,274
[SPEAKER_11]: I used to use Magic Engine to emulate, but later I came across an emulator that's a lot better.

1946
02:15:40,334 --> 02:15:41,334
[SPEAKER_11]: It's called Ootake.

1947
02:15:42,495 --> 02:15:43,996
[SPEAKER_11]: It's O-O-T-A-K-E.

1948
02:15:44,336 --> 02:15:45,777
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was developed by a Japanese guy.

1949
02:15:45,897 --> 02:15:53,721
[SPEAKER_11]: From what I remember hearing, Magic Engine has some input lag, which is a common hindrance in emulators, and Ootake has practically none at all.

1950
02:15:53,981 --> 02:15:56,142
[SPEAKER_11]: Plus it's free as opposed to Magic Engine where you have to pay.

1951
02:15:56,662 --> 02:15:59,766
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd say it's a very worthwhile emulator for the sole reason that it's free.

1952
02:16:00,727 --> 02:16:04,111
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, I am with DarkSakura in hoping that Planet Harriers can get emulated.

1953
02:16:04,672 --> 02:16:11,680
[SPEAKER_11]: Just recently, someone managed to get Sega's Model 3 hardware almost emulated and I hope that another genius can crack the Hikaru and emulate it too.

1954
02:16:12,100 --> 02:16:12,781
[SPEAKER_11]: You were going to say something?

1955
02:16:13,809 --> 02:16:14,570
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm sorry.

1956
02:16:14,610 --> 02:16:17,071
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just mouse being retarded.

1957
02:16:17,772 --> 02:16:17,952
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1958
02:16:19,112 --> 02:16:21,234
[SPEAKER_11]: Keep being one of the best gaming podcasts out there.

1959
02:16:21,554 --> 02:16:23,095
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm so glad I came across you guys.

1960
02:16:23,135 --> 02:16:25,536
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been listening to past shows where you discuss Bimani stuff.

1961
02:16:25,957 --> 02:16:29,479
[SPEAKER_11]: Also makes me want to pick up Step Mania again, even though I sucked at it back in high school.

1962
02:16:31,471 --> 02:16:32,472
[SPEAKER_11]: Zether's my buddy now.

1963
02:16:33,693 --> 02:16:36,354
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, we have two more to go.

1964
02:16:37,815 --> 02:16:40,938
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello, OLR, long-time listener, first-time writer-inner.

1965
02:16:42,719 --> 02:16:46,621
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that OLR is a family, and while gaming is our main passion, we like to help people out.

1966
02:16:46,661 --> 02:16:54,527
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, this one I decided I was going to read because it's for extra life.

1967
02:16:55,047 --> 02:16:55,287
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1968
02:16:55,447 --> 02:16:55,628
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1969
02:16:57,649 --> 02:17:00,050
[SPEAKER_11]: This is an opportunity for OL Army to combine the two.

1970
02:17:00,150 --> 02:17:03,272
[SPEAKER_11]: Today I'm writing in to help out sick kids who don't have the lives we do.

1971
02:17:03,773 --> 02:17:07,295
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll be participating in the Extra Life Gaming Marathon on October 15th.

1972
02:17:07,775 --> 02:17:11,818
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll attempt to game for 24 hours to raise money for Children's Miracle Network Hospitals.

1973
02:17:12,238 --> 02:17:12,598
[SPEAKER_11]: My goal is $500.

1974
02:17:12,658 --> 02:17:13,139
[SPEAKER_11]: So far I'm at zero.

1975
02:17:15,240 --> 02:17:15,880
[SPEAKER_11]: I need your help.

1976
02:17:16,041 --> 02:17:20,783
[SPEAKER_11]: If you can please post this link into live chat forums, Twitter, Facebook, I would greatly appreciate it.

1977
02:17:20,823 --> 02:17:22,224
[SPEAKER_11]: And I will be linking that shortly.

1978
02:17:22,664 --> 02:17:25,486
[SPEAKER_11]: The donation is safe and 100% tax deductible.

1979
02:17:25,926 --> 02:17:29,668
[SPEAKER_11]: In addition, I'll attempt to tweet my gaming process on October 15th.

1980
02:17:30,128 --> 02:17:38,853
[SPEAKER_11]: Those who are interested may follow Ionotropic, that's capital I, I-O-N-O-T-R-O-P-I-C, and that's on Twitter.

1981
02:17:39,513 --> 02:17:41,935
[SPEAKER_11]: I know the economy is bad and money is tight, but this is important.

1982
02:17:42,095 --> 02:17:44,416
[SPEAKER_11]: Even the smallest contribution will be greatly appreciated.

1983
02:17:44,756 --> 02:17:46,396
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's join together to help kids in need.

1984
02:17:46,496 --> 02:17:48,437
[SPEAKER_11]: With deepest gratitude, Ionotropic.

1985
02:17:48,557 --> 02:17:52,858
[SPEAKER_11]: And I will be doing the copy-paste real quick.

1986
02:17:54,858 --> 02:18:02,260
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know there's actually a few people that listen to OLR because I've seen it show up on Twitter and Facebook and so forth that are doing this Extra Life thing that's coming out next weekend.

1987
02:18:02,300 --> 02:18:08,321
[SPEAKER_04]: I think even Irene, who has gone by Rice Princess on this show previously, is doing this too.

1988
02:18:08,441 --> 02:18:10,422
[SPEAKER_04]: So good luck to everybody participating.

1989
02:18:10,882 --> 02:18:11,162
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

1990
02:18:11,222 --> 02:18:11,682
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll do it too.

1991
02:18:11,922 --> 02:18:12,462
[SPEAKER_09]: Why don't we do it too?

1992
02:18:13,044 --> 02:18:13,684
[SPEAKER_04]: It's too soon.

1993
02:18:13,864 --> 02:18:18,687
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like to do something for charity, but this particular one is too soon.

1994
02:18:18,847 --> 02:18:20,427
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't do it on that short notice.

1995
02:18:20,708 --> 02:18:25,150
[SPEAKER_02]: As much as I'd love to play video games for 24 hours, the wife would not let me.

1996
02:18:25,210 --> 02:18:27,651
[SPEAKER_02]: She would take care of the baby for 24 hours.

1997
02:18:27,751 --> 02:18:29,872
[SPEAKER_04]: I would happily support other people in their effort, though.

1998
02:18:30,092 --> 02:18:30,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

1999
02:18:31,012 --> 02:18:34,274
[SPEAKER_04]: As far as us, maybe on a three-day weekend at some point soon.

2000
02:18:34,614 --> 02:18:35,835
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love to play a game.

2001
02:18:37,015 --> 02:18:37,855
[SPEAKER_02]: Screw 24 hours.

2002
02:18:37,915 --> 02:18:38,856
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd go as long as I could.

2003
02:18:39,592 --> 02:18:59,439
[SPEAKER_11]: aww well maybe maybe what I'll do is I'll just play all day and for every hour that I play you're just looking for an excuse to play video games all day shut up well maybe we'll do something along the lines of whatever I happen to pull out of it I'll just send a dude cool

2004
02:19:01,108 --> 02:19:01,449
[SPEAKER_03]: Good deal.

2005
02:19:01,749 --> 02:19:02,009
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

2006
02:19:02,990 --> 02:19:05,793
[SPEAKER_11]: So, moving forward, last email.

2007
02:19:06,433 --> 02:19:09,616
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening, OLR, and also guest hosts who didn't show up.

2008
02:19:10,157 --> 02:19:12,399
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm being plain.

2009
02:19:12,439 --> 02:19:12,979
[SPEAKER_11]: She couldn't make it.

2010
02:19:13,300 --> 02:19:14,641
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, we ended up not having Tiara.

2011
02:19:15,542 --> 02:19:15,982
[SPEAKER_11]: She couldn't make it.

2012
02:19:16,002 --> 02:19:16,543
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that's too bad.

2013
02:19:16,823 --> 02:19:16,963
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

2014
02:19:18,104 --> 02:19:19,525
[SPEAKER_11]: But I'll go ahead and read the email.

2015
02:19:19,565 --> 02:19:21,426
[SPEAKER_11]: Gaming Week, Gears of War 3, wow.

2016
02:19:21,566 --> 02:19:25,329
[SPEAKER_11]: Next week, wow, Dark Souls, Rage, Backup, Homefront, Newt, Duke, I don't know.

2017
02:19:26,810 --> 02:19:27,410
[SPEAKER_09]: Why do I... What?

2018
02:19:29,351 --> 02:19:30,652
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, why do we need to know you're Gaming Week?

2019
02:19:30,732 --> 02:19:31,192
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I'm kidding.

2020
02:19:31,393 --> 02:19:32,653
[SPEAKER_11]: Every gamer has a voice.

2021
02:19:33,874 --> 02:19:35,575
[SPEAKER_11]: I was just murmuring after Dead Island.

2022
02:19:36,916 --> 02:19:40,318
[SPEAKER_11]: Who do I talk to about purchasing the DDR Freak domain name?

2023
02:19:41,639 --> 02:19:55,597
[SPEAKER_11]: it would feel like I would be owning a piece of the past a relic from a different time when I was younger anyways at this point all of our posts on the forum will be lost in time like tears in rain for the record probably not because I'm sure Jason still has the um

2024
02:19:56,958 --> 02:20:22,002
[SPEAKER_04]: the uh forum logs that would be terrible to like troll it and just put like coming back soon and then just never ever ever update I don't see it being let go of honestly I don't see it being let go of either but let it be known if they are you've got competition because if they do put that domain up for sale I want it and I will put it to a legitimate purpose and will not um sell it spam whatever I want it absolutely

2025
02:20:24,070 --> 02:20:25,351
[SPEAKER_04]: Talk to J-Dog

2026
02:20:48,095 --> 02:21:03,588
[SPEAKER_11]: And the plates on my car, it still says DDRPLYR But on my newer car, 2010 Mazda MX-5 Miata Shoutout to all of OLR, Peace, and AAA I hope you have AAA if you've got a Miata shit Get some AAA!

2027
02:21:03,648 --> 02:21:04,409
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah

2028
02:21:07,142 --> 02:21:07,622
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

2029
02:21:08,542 --> 02:21:09,342
[SPEAKER_04]: Was that it for emails?

2030
02:21:09,702 --> 02:21:09,983
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes!

2031
02:21:10,203 --> 02:21:14,903
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if you want to make Jamie work, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com Send us more emails for next week.

2032
02:21:14,923 --> 02:21:15,843
[SPEAKER_04]: I will cut a bitch if you make me work.

2033
02:21:15,863 --> 02:21:17,044
[SPEAKER_04]: And yes, we are reading emails again.

2034
02:21:17,524 --> 02:21:17,844
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

2035
02:21:18,904 --> 02:21:19,644
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's move on.

2036
02:21:19,804 --> 02:21:20,364
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki!

2037
02:21:21,624 --> 02:21:22,185
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

2038
02:21:22,605 --> 02:21:25,305
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki's already trying to see if the domain's available.

2039
02:21:26,965 --> 02:21:27,665
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it's not.

2040
02:21:27,866 --> 02:21:30,006
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody would have snatched it up by now if it was.

2041
02:21:30,646 --> 02:21:31,286
[SPEAKER_04]: It already is.

2042
02:21:31,766 --> 02:21:32,046
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

2043
02:21:32,906 --> 02:21:35,607
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, so let's talk a little bit about...

2044
02:21:37,859 --> 02:21:42,021
[SPEAKER_02]: Sony, and you know they have the phone brand Ericsson.

2045
02:21:42,521 --> 02:21:45,222
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they actually may be buying out Ericsson.

2046
02:21:46,643 --> 02:21:47,143
[SPEAKER_02]: It's interesting.

2047
02:21:47,163 --> 02:21:48,624
[SPEAKER_02]: This is coming from the Wall Street Journal.

2048
02:21:49,324 --> 02:21:53,886
[SPEAKER_02]: And apparently they're going to be buying out Ericsson, the mobile phone company, I guess they teamed up with back in 2001.

2049
02:21:54,186 --> 02:21:59,369
[SPEAKER_02]: And, of course, they just recently released the Xperia Play through the Ericsson line.

2050
02:22:01,970 --> 02:22:03,611
[SPEAKER_02]: And, of course, they're going to have, you know...

2051
02:22:06,022 --> 02:22:06,762
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2052
02:22:19,495 --> 02:22:46,648
[SPEAKER_02]: then basically the first thing they would do is have a Playstation phone that's actually a Playstation phone instead of just this Xperia Play or some roundabout weird name like that which people still dub it the Playstation phone but if Sony actually has their own true phone company then or phone hardware manufacturer that'd be kind of neat they'd be joining up I guess against Apple even taking them on

2053
02:22:47,668 --> 02:22:48,649
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, head first.

2054
02:22:50,810 --> 02:22:51,410
[SPEAKER_02]: Be interesting.

2055
02:22:53,672 --> 02:22:54,012
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

2056
02:22:55,713 --> 02:22:56,773
[SPEAKER_02]: Has it worked for the computers?

2057
02:22:57,274 --> 02:22:59,555
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the files are damn fucking expensive.

2058
02:22:59,795 --> 02:23:01,296
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, for real.

2059
02:23:02,935 --> 02:23:05,097
[SPEAKER_02]: But apples are very expensive as well.

2060
02:23:05,637 --> 02:23:06,498
[SPEAKER_02]: People buy those.

2061
02:23:06,878 --> 02:23:07,438
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.

2062
02:23:07,839 --> 02:23:10,621
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes it's about just having that status.

2063
02:23:12,442 --> 02:23:16,085
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there's a lot of games looking to be getting that same status as well.

2064
02:23:16,145 --> 02:23:19,467
[SPEAKER_04]: You kind of heard YYR talk about it a little bit when he was on the phone earlier.

2065
02:23:19,487 --> 02:23:22,550
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes it's kind of hard to get noticed and get coverage on a lot of the big sites.

2066
02:23:23,130 --> 02:23:26,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Activision is trying to help some indie games get exposure.

2067
02:23:26,611 --> 02:23:29,853
[SPEAKER_04]: There's an indie games competition that they did before.

2068
02:23:30,473 --> 02:23:38,536
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess what happened is that the publisher is going to be doing this again, offering $250,000 to two indie developers.

2069
02:23:39,937 --> 02:23:43,298
[SPEAKER_04]: Ownership of submission rights will remain with the creator.

2070
02:23:43,338 --> 02:23:44,959
[SPEAKER_04]: They're very important to put that in the press release.

2071
02:23:45,639 --> 02:24:09,549
[SPEAKER_04]: and um yeah there you go Activision is working with IndieCade to uh actually do the contest and it'll be open for submissions from now through December 31st that's awesome hopefully you can uh oh maybe YYR should uh submit Bungie Ferret Tossing as you know the the future of gaming all right anyhow uh DarkSakura what do you got for us

2072
02:24:11,548 --> 02:24:20,579
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, as I brought up earlier when I was trying to skip doing the mailbag... Minecraft has something new in it.

2073
02:24:21,300 --> 02:24:27,447
[SPEAKER_11]: There have been screenshots released from a work-in-progress version that has dragons...

2074
02:24:29,268 --> 02:24:30,449
[SPEAKER_11]: Ooh, dragons.

2075
02:24:32,609 --> 02:24:38,471
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's either supposed to go in there or maybe not ever.

2076
02:24:38,631 --> 02:24:43,752
[SPEAKER_11]: But the creator has been tweeting that texturing the dragon was interesting.

2077
02:24:45,973 --> 02:24:49,413
[SPEAKER_11]: So it looks kind of blocky like everything in Minecraft does.

2078
02:24:51,754 --> 02:24:52,434
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, dragons.

2079
02:24:54,035 --> 02:24:54,315
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it.

2080
02:24:55,015 --> 02:24:55,415
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2081
02:24:55,748 --> 02:24:56,690
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

2082
02:25:08,772 --> 02:25:09,532
[SPEAKER_02]: My guess at least.

2083
02:25:11,834 --> 02:25:15,156
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is also cool since we were talking a little bit about indie games and stuff.

2084
02:25:15,676 --> 02:25:19,238
[SPEAKER_02]: OnLive is actually putting on some new indie games this fall.

2085
02:25:19,798 --> 02:25:25,742
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of these actually you might recognize because they've been hitting different console platforms as well as PC.

2086
02:25:26,562 --> 02:25:30,064
[SPEAKER_02]: Including Orcs Must Die, which was just released on Xbox Live Arcade.

2087
02:25:30,284 --> 02:25:33,386
[SPEAKER_02]: Limbo, Magicka, Bastion.

2088
02:25:33,986 --> 02:25:55,622
[SPEAKER_02]: Space Chem, and Avadon the Black Fortress and those are being added to already existing indie games that are on there including Braid, Trine, World of Goo, and The Maw so that's kind of cool that there will be kind of a showcase of all sorts of games not just you know streaming games

2089
02:25:58,681 --> 02:25:59,001
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

2090
02:25:59,442 --> 02:26:03,126
[SPEAKER_04]: It's good that OnLive is actually getting more games because that's kind of where they're hurting right now.

2091
02:26:03,146 --> 02:26:04,167
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?

2092
02:26:04,407 --> 02:26:04,587
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

2093
02:26:04,887 --> 02:26:05,728
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's always a good thing.

2094
02:26:06,809 --> 02:26:08,091
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a couple more stories for you guys.

2095
02:26:08,111 --> 02:26:11,274
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we're going to go to the Twitter with twitter.com slash OLR.

2096
02:26:11,314 --> 02:26:14,297
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't seen hardly anything show up on there, so maybe after I say that it will.

2097
02:26:15,238 --> 02:26:18,881
[SPEAKER_04]: Or also there's going to be the Skype line, of course, 1-877-GAME-OLR in just a moment.

2098
02:26:22,445 --> 02:26:24,006
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess this is interesting.

2099
02:26:25,147 --> 02:26:31,752
[SPEAKER_04]: A study was done by Website Bundle who tracks credit card spending.

2100
02:26:32,233 --> 02:26:35,896
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not exactly sure how that works, but I guess they track all the transactions or whatever.

2101
02:26:36,597 --> 02:26:38,818
[SPEAKER_04]: And what the study did is that it looked at...

2102
02:26:39,679 --> 02:26:40,200
[SPEAKER_04]: HUNNINGTON, NEW YORK

2103
02:26:55,424 --> 02:26:56,165
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2104
02:27:12,365 --> 02:27:14,647
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, it's halfway between here and Fresno.

2105
02:27:14,687 --> 02:27:16,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, what else can I say about Modesto?

2106
02:27:16,988 --> 02:27:18,409
[SPEAKER_04]: Fresno's also on the list.

2107
02:27:18,489 --> 02:27:19,770
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what else was on the list?

2108
02:27:20,371 --> 02:27:21,271
[SPEAKER_04]: Stockton.

2109
02:27:21,712 --> 02:27:22,532
[SPEAKER_04]: Was Stockton on the list?

2110
02:27:22,892 --> 02:27:23,553
[SPEAKER_04]: Fresno's at number 19.

2111
02:27:23,593 --> 02:27:25,074
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it's not like they have much to do there.

2112
02:27:25,574 --> 02:27:26,795
[SPEAKER_04]: Sacramento's not even on the list.

2113
02:27:26,875 --> 02:27:29,577
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of these strike me as, like, suburb-y things.

2114
02:27:29,957 --> 02:27:31,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, then again, Pittsburgh's, like, number six.

2115
02:27:32,379 --> 02:27:34,460
[SPEAKER_04]: So there are some... Chesapeake, Virginia's number four.

2116
02:27:35,661 --> 02:27:38,083
[SPEAKER_04]: So there are some bigger cities that are on there.

2117
02:27:38,123 --> 02:27:38,483
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

2118
02:27:40,177 --> 02:27:41,617
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting, then Virginia Beach is at 10.

2119
02:27:42,598 --> 02:27:43,698
[SPEAKER_04]: Aren't they right near each other?

2120
02:27:44,058 --> 02:27:44,398
[SPEAKER_04]: Miami.

2121
02:27:44,418 --> 02:27:44,878
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they are.

2122
02:27:45,998 --> 02:27:46,539
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you go.

2123
02:27:46,599 --> 02:27:47,639
[SPEAKER_04]: That's your list of games.

2124
02:27:47,679 --> 02:27:49,199
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, Stockton, number 41.

2125
02:27:50,059 --> 02:27:51,200
[SPEAKER_04]: Hell, well, Stockton.

2126
02:27:51,680 --> 02:27:55,681
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess those are the big cities that buy video games probably because there's nothing else to do.

2127
02:27:56,041 --> 02:27:58,081
[SPEAKER_04]: And Rama says, Huntington is Long Island.

2128
02:27:58,121 --> 02:27:58,421
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2129
02:27:58,461 --> 02:27:59,582
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, we're California kids.

2130
02:27:59,622 --> 02:28:01,082
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't know our East Coast geography as well.

2131
02:28:01,122 --> 02:28:02,202
[SPEAKER_04]: Huntington is Long Island.

2132
02:28:03,803 --> 02:28:03,963
Hmm.

2133
02:28:05,225 --> 02:28:07,108
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, one more story.

2134
02:28:07,288 --> 02:28:14,721
[SPEAKER_04]: I threw this in here at the last minute because it's related to music games and DDR, which by the way, I did a little research on the DDR Freak domain.

2135
02:28:15,061 --> 02:28:16,263
[SPEAKER_04]: It's registered through July 2017.

2136
02:28:16,784 --> 02:28:19,548
[SPEAKER_04]: So we won't be getting that anytime soon.

2137
02:28:21,266 --> 02:28:22,547
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not surprising at all, though.

2138
02:28:22,567 --> 02:28:25,910
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that site probably still generates quite a bit of traffic, even though it's not there.

2139
02:28:25,970 --> 02:28:27,211
[SPEAKER_04]: Did it ever, like, come back up?

2140
02:28:28,132 --> 02:28:28,332
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

2141
02:28:28,772 --> 02:28:32,055
[SPEAKER_04]: Or did the server get... I know the servers were, like, getting unplugged or whatever.

2142
02:28:32,075 --> 02:28:33,496
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's not back up.

2143
02:28:33,556 --> 02:28:35,058
[SPEAKER_09]: It's still just the demo part.

2144
02:28:35,078 --> 02:28:37,540
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it just goes to... GoDaddy.

2145
02:28:38,040 --> 02:28:38,360
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

2146
02:28:39,001 --> 02:28:45,126
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you, you know, click on the register thing, then it has you go to one of those buy out a used domain theme.

2147
02:28:46,027 --> 02:28:47,028
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah.

2148
02:28:47,168 --> 02:28:48,329
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it expiring anyway?

2149
02:28:48,909 --> 02:28:49,510
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I don't think so.

2150
02:28:52,617 --> 02:28:53,179
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

2151
02:28:55,425 --> 02:28:56,930
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll have to figure out what's going on.

2152
02:29:01,380 --> 02:29:02,701
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at this, you guys.

2153
02:29:02,721 --> 02:29:03,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Based on true events.

2154
02:29:30,660 --> 02:29:31,001
[SPEAKER_12]: Who knows?

2155
02:29:31,121 --> 02:29:32,284
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you see what she's wearing right now?

2156
02:29:32,404 --> 02:29:33,587
[SPEAKER_12]: I look so much better than her.

2157
02:29:33,627 --> 02:29:34,910
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not even a competition.

2158
02:29:35,010 --> 02:29:35,892
[SPEAKER_12]: No one can beat me.

2159
02:29:57,694 --> 02:29:58,834
[SPEAKER_12]: It's nothing personal.

2160
02:29:59,614 --> 02:30:01,175
[SPEAKER_02]: Super Jets DX.

2161
02:30:05,156 --> 02:30:07,756
[SPEAKER_04]: This whole thing looks like it was shot in front of a green screen.

2162
02:30:11,217 --> 02:30:12,997
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what that looks like to me, to be real?

2163
02:30:13,277 --> 02:30:18,378
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the Ark Music Factory equivalent of movies, is what this is.

2164
02:30:18,678 --> 02:30:22,299
[SPEAKER_04]: Enjoy your Rebecca Black music on your way to watch this premiere if you go.

2165
02:30:22,419 --> 02:30:24,419
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care that it's about a dance game.

2166
02:30:24,860 --> 02:30:26,820
[SPEAKER_04]: It's only just kind of sad, that's all.

2167
02:30:29,255 --> 02:30:47,588
[SPEAKER_02]: so um yeah that looks terrible sure does alright well is it a world premiere if no one goes to see it it's a neighborhood premiere it's a street premiere

2168
02:30:49,116 --> 02:30:54,079
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, moving on to our phone lines.

2169
02:30:54,099 --> 02:30:58,582
[SPEAKER_04]: 1-877-GAME-OLR is the number to call and I'm opening those up right now.

2170
02:30:59,262 --> 02:31:01,023
[SPEAKER_04]: Making sure we're online and available.

2171
02:31:03,805 --> 02:31:05,266
[SPEAKER_04]: I am, I'm like out of practice.

2172
02:31:05,326 --> 02:31:08,768
[SPEAKER_04]: I only miss like two weeks of show and I forget how to multitask.

2173
02:31:09,068 --> 02:31:09,708
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of sad.

2174
02:31:10,429 --> 02:31:12,850
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you have this many problems when I was gone, DarkSakura?

2175
02:31:13,131 --> 02:31:13,271
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

2176
02:31:14,211 --> 02:31:14,852
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I had a few.

2177
02:31:15,072 --> 02:31:15,392
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

2178
02:31:16,292 --> 02:31:16,953
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel better then.

2179
02:31:18,860 --> 02:31:19,140
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2180
02:31:19,741 --> 02:31:22,523
[SPEAKER_04]: We are up and available on Skype.

2181
02:31:22,543 --> 02:31:23,424
[SPEAKER_04]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2182
02:31:23,504 --> 02:31:26,126
[SPEAKER_04]: Our username on Skype, of course, is Orange Lounge Radio.

2183
02:31:26,547 --> 02:31:32,572
[SPEAKER_04]: In the meantime, we're going to get to some of our Twitter topics that you guys send us every week at twitter.com slash OLR.

2184
02:31:33,173 --> 02:31:37,316
[SPEAKER_04]: And the first and only tweet so far comes to us from Dark Tetsuya.

2185
02:31:37,376 --> 02:31:38,037
[SPEAKER_04]: Not Dark Sakura.

2186
02:31:38,077 --> 02:31:38,417
[SPEAKER_04]: She's here.

2187
02:31:38,757 --> 02:31:43,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Dark Tetsuya says, On the topic of DDR Freak, have you heard about this reunion tournament thing they're doing?

2188
02:31:44,182 --> 02:31:46,805
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope we can show support for him somehow.

2189
02:31:46,986 --> 02:31:47,987
[SPEAKER_04]: Good question.

2190
02:31:48,147 --> 02:31:50,710
[SPEAKER_04]: I had heard there was supposed to be an event on 20 November.

2191
02:31:50,830 --> 02:31:51,691
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that even a weekend?

2192
02:31:53,053 --> 02:31:54,415
[SPEAKER_04]: That this is happening 20 November?

2193
02:31:56,057 --> 02:31:56,918
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's a Thursday.

2194
02:31:57,579 --> 02:31:59,821
[SPEAKER_04]: So it would have to be like 20... Oh no, I'm looking at October.

2195
02:31:59,881 --> 02:32:00,923
[SPEAKER_11]: No, 20 November is a Sunday.

2196
02:32:02,095 --> 02:32:04,578
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm all for it if they do a meetup on 20 November.

2197
02:32:04,618 --> 02:32:07,622
[SPEAKER_04]: But no, I haven't heard anything since the original Facebook poll.

2198
02:32:08,002 --> 02:32:10,265
[SPEAKER_04]: So we need to look at Facebook and follow up on that.

2199
02:32:10,345 --> 02:32:10,705
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

2200
02:32:11,106 --> 02:32:12,067
[SPEAKER_04]: But we'll find out.

2201
02:32:12,287 --> 02:32:12,988
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good question.

2202
02:32:13,568 --> 02:32:15,230
[SPEAKER_04]: Meanwhile, let's go to the phones.

2203
02:32:15,290 --> 02:32:16,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2204
02:32:16,271 --> 02:32:16,572
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

2205
02:32:17,287 --> 02:32:18,227
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Shane.

2206
02:32:18,708 --> 02:32:19,728
[SPEAKER_08]: What's up, Shane?

2207
02:32:20,328 --> 02:32:23,750
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't know what name I was going to use, so I changed it midway.

2208
02:32:23,870 --> 02:32:24,550
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

2209
02:32:24,590 --> 02:32:26,391
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes we call you Mikla Toph, but now you're Shane.

2210
02:32:26,891 --> 02:32:27,671
[SPEAKER_04]: How about Mikla Shane?

2211
02:32:27,691 --> 02:32:30,052
[SPEAKER_08]: Mikla Shane.

2212
02:32:30,352 --> 02:32:30,672
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing.

2213
02:32:30,732 --> 02:32:33,633
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just enjoying Final Fantasy XIV right now.

2214
02:32:33,773 --> 02:32:35,894
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you hear us talking about that earlier?

2215
02:32:36,054 --> 02:32:37,895
[SPEAKER_08]: No, because your feed sucks tonight.

2216
02:32:38,395 --> 02:32:39,135
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not us.

2217
02:32:39,235 --> 02:32:40,216
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what's going on.

2218
02:32:40,256 --> 02:32:40,776
[SPEAKER_04]: We're trying.

2219
02:32:40,796 --> 02:32:43,137
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all games, I know, but I'm still blaming you.

2220
02:32:43,197 --> 02:32:46,858
[SPEAKER_04]: All games, you know what, they give it to us for free, so if they have an off night, I can't get to it.

2221
02:32:46,878 --> 02:32:49,819
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you can get aids for free, too, but it doesn't mean you should use it.

2222
02:32:50,300 --> 02:32:50,840
[SPEAKER_08]: Shine!

2223
02:32:52,200 --> 02:32:53,241
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that is a quote.

2224
02:32:56,862 --> 02:32:57,882
[SPEAKER_11]: He does have a point.

2225
02:33:00,263 --> 02:33:01,404
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get yours for free.

2226
02:33:03,228 --> 02:33:05,429
[SPEAKER_11]: Comparing Yaris with AIDS is pretty accurate, I would say.

2227
02:33:05,469 --> 02:33:09,651
[SPEAKER_08]: You can probably get Mexican labors for free, but you don't want them either.

2228
02:33:11,172 --> 02:33:16,074
[SPEAKER_04]: Final Fantasy XIV you can pay $25 for, and yet now you say this is worth it.

2229
02:33:16,355 --> 02:33:18,436
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you can actually get it cheaper than that, but yeah.

2230
02:33:18,596 --> 02:33:19,316
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so fine.

2231
02:33:19,336 --> 02:33:20,697
[SPEAKER_04]: You can get it on eBay or whatever.

2232
02:33:20,757 --> 02:33:25,219
[SPEAKER_04]: But now you have come around on Final Fantasy XIV and you say Final Fantasy XIV is worth it.

2233
02:33:25,618 --> 02:33:30,879
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, it only took a year of them completely overhauling the game for it to be playable.

2234
02:33:30,899 --> 02:33:34,060
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so how has this game gone from bad to good, in your opinion?

2235
02:33:34,680 --> 02:33:45,843
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I mean, it's turned into what it looked like from the get-go, a Final Fantasy XI clone, and we played that for years and years, and it...

2236
02:33:46,503 --> 02:33:47,804
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching!

2237
02:34:04,577 --> 02:34:06,198
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2238
02:34:28,047 --> 02:34:46,577
[SPEAKER_08]: nope nope they don't have a good color of blue so I went with brown but there's like eight different shades of brown so I keep starting and like oh this is good for five minutes but I need a different brown color so the game is fun huh yes does that mean they're gonna start charging for it soon

2239
02:34:47,216 --> 02:35:03,511
[SPEAKER_08]: probably not because I remember reading a quote saying that they would not start charging until the game was at the point that they wanted it to be at and recently with this new patch that came out this week they said that they feel the game is only halfway to that goal

2240
02:35:04,211 --> 02:35:07,634
[SPEAKER_08]: of being where they would want it to be as a playable game.

2241
02:35:08,574 --> 02:35:13,598
[SPEAKER_08]: And that took a year, so I'm hoping for another year of free not paying for it every month.

2242
02:35:14,138 --> 02:35:16,700
[SPEAKER_08]: And if it keeps up like that, I'll continue to play.

2243
02:35:17,161 --> 02:35:28,749
[SPEAKER_08]: And maybe if I get past level five, and they got rid of the physical level, so it's only one level, your class level, no longer like class four, physical six, or something stupid like that.

2244
02:35:29,330 --> 02:35:30,931
[SPEAKER_08]: So maybe if I get past level five,

2245
02:35:32,132 --> 02:35:37,817
[SPEAKER_08]: I like it even more and I want to keep playing it because it is technically one of the cheaper MMOs to play monthly.

2246
02:35:38,017 --> 02:35:38,417
[SPEAKER_08]: It's only like $12.

2247
02:35:40,843 --> 02:35:41,263
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess.

2248
02:35:41,323 --> 02:35:42,784
[SPEAKER_04]: But I mean, WoW's 15.

2249
02:35:43,544 --> 02:35:45,024
[SPEAKER_04]: Most are priced in that area, right?

2250
02:35:45,064 --> 02:35:46,845
[SPEAKER_04]: How much is the Star Wars MMO going to be?

2251
02:35:46,865 --> 02:35:47,325
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we know yet?

2252
02:35:47,345 --> 02:35:55,268
[SPEAKER_08]: 15, they said, per month, unless you do the same thing WoW does, where if you pay for six months at a time, you get for a dollar cheaper per month, technically.

2253
02:35:55,488 --> 02:35:55,688
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

2254
02:35:55,988 --> 02:35:56,148
[SPEAKER_08]: Gotcha.

2255
02:35:56,168 --> 02:35:56,808
[SPEAKER_08]: Which isn't worth it.

2256
02:35:57,969 --> 02:36:03,391
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, for the live listeners, our feed went down, but it's back up.

2257
02:36:03,471 --> 02:36:04,111
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was us.

2258
02:36:04,211 --> 02:36:04,971
[SPEAKER_04]: Winamp crashed.

2259
02:36:05,191 --> 02:36:05,531
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

2260
02:36:05,751 --> 02:36:09,373
[SPEAKER_04]: It's probably got sick of all the delay stuff that's going on on the other side.

2261
02:36:09,533 --> 02:36:09,853
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

2262
02:36:10,033 --> 02:36:10,213
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2263
02:36:10,512 --> 02:36:13,874
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, you should just let everybody call into Skype and then we could just listen that way.

2264
02:36:15,215 --> 02:36:16,696
[SPEAKER_08]: Have a Skype party.

2265
02:36:18,537 --> 02:36:24,942
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyway, if we're done talking about that real quick, I also wanted to mention that Tapsonic has also been taking over for me.

2266
02:36:25,582 --> 02:36:32,147
[SPEAKER_08]: They updated the free songs and they added some quote-unquote American songs that are actually pretty fun to play.

2267
02:36:33,858 --> 02:37:02,263
[SPEAKER_08]: uh like Passion Pit's on there Gwen Stefani's on there and then some new K-pop got added for free because I don't pay for stuff on that yet because I don't like microtransactions right and you have to pay like each time you play a song right yeah I extra don't like that that's dumb um and also Technica 3's soundtrack got leaked and it's all over YouTube and I love it is there anything I'd actually know huh is there anything I'd actually know in it

2268
02:37:03,292 --> 02:37:04,854
[SPEAKER_08]: It's got Sampling Masters in it.

2269
02:37:06,116 --> 02:37:06,897
[SPEAKER_08]: They do a song.

2270
02:37:08,018 --> 02:37:11,943
[SPEAKER_08]: But I guess one of the people from Sampling Masters has been in the past few games and I didn't know that.

2271
02:37:12,884 --> 02:37:15,307
[SPEAKER_08]: No, but they put a lot of happy hardcore in there.

2272
02:37:15,727 --> 02:37:18,410
[SPEAKER_08]: Stuff I could see on one of the happy-to-be-hardcore CDs.

2273
02:37:18,490 --> 02:37:19,812
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's really good and I love it.

2274
02:37:21,750 --> 02:37:49,064
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well we're gonna let you go My keyboard lights up, I got a new keyboard and it's changing colors a lot Alright, we're gonna let you go so we can get some more calls here That's fine, I just won't be able to listen to what you guys say after this Well, we had the crash, so try again, maybe it's better now, who knows I doubt it Fine, bye Bye He's so rude He's so optimistic He really is What an ass Let's go to the phones and see if our next caller's nicer Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

2275
02:37:52,202 --> 02:37:54,643
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, hola, bienvenidos a Orange Lounge Radio.

2276
02:37:55,043 --> 02:37:55,503
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

2277
02:37:55,883 --> 02:37:57,043
[SPEAKER_10]: Stand in the silence.

2278
02:37:57,083 --> 02:37:57,463
[SPEAKER_04]: Hang up.

2279
02:37:57,523 --> 02:37:58,524
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a crank caller.

2280
02:37:59,424 --> 02:38:01,064
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess they knew their connection wasn't working.

2281
02:38:01,104 --> 02:38:02,065
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

2282
02:38:02,085 --> 02:38:05,406
[SPEAKER_04]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2283
02:38:06,946 --> 02:38:08,586
[SPEAKER_04]: And in the meantime, I'll try to go back to Twitter.

2284
02:38:09,387 --> 02:38:11,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Except I closed Firefox like a genius.

2285
02:38:12,727 --> 02:38:13,288
[SPEAKER_04]: Genius.

2286
02:38:13,428 --> 02:38:18,089
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess we could have kept Shane on to, you know, be optimistic about things a little more.

2287
02:38:20,970 --> 02:38:21,890
[SPEAKER_09]: I like Shane.

2288
02:38:23,502 --> 02:38:24,883
[SPEAKER_04]: I like him when he's appropriate.

2289
02:38:24,923 --> 02:38:25,544
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm just kidding.

2290
02:38:25,564 --> 02:38:29,048
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess his inappropriateness is part of what makes him Shane, right?

2291
02:38:30,249 --> 02:38:30,449
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

2292
02:38:30,589 --> 02:38:32,771
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, and you take your friends as they are.

2293
02:38:32,791 --> 02:38:34,733
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess.

2294
02:38:34,753 --> 02:38:36,915
[SPEAKER_11]: Or you murder them in their sleep.

2295
02:38:37,055 --> 02:38:38,237
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, you take them as they are.

2296
02:38:39,642 --> 02:38:45,105
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's go to our Twitter topics, because I know we have at least a couple more coming in here.

2297
02:38:45,925 --> 02:38:47,466
[SPEAKER_04]: TigerClaw sent us some tweets.

2298
02:38:48,226 --> 02:38:52,649
[SPEAKER_04]: Take down notice against some Battlestar Galactica modders.

2299
02:38:52,689 --> 02:38:54,449
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a tweet to us from TigerClaw.

2300
02:38:58,271 --> 02:39:26,404
[SPEAKER_04]: uh let's see a Battlestar Galactica mod for Nexus and I guess this uh made the attention of NBC Universal who sent a cease and desist letter to ModDB who'd been hosting the work on it I don't even wow I don't even know what this is about here uh but of course there is already a Battlestar Galactica online game um so I'm sure this is definitely a conflict of interest when you put Battlestar Galactica into uh another game

2301
02:39:28,154 --> 02:39:55,705
[SPEAKER_02]: well it's also you know if you're doing a mod that's like with licensed properties and stuff like that I mean that's kind of to be expected if you know if you're doing your own mod or something like that you know and that's a little different by the way this game had to remove everything that was related to Battlestar Galactica so not just the popular one so bummer alright let's see also hold on

2302
02:39:57,731 --> 02:39:58,551
[SPEAKER_04]: Why are you calling back?

2303
02:40:00,351 --> 02:40:00,792
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

2304
02:40:00,852 --> 02:40:02,192
[SPEAKER_08]: You didn't have any other callers.

2305
02:40:02,212 --> 02:40:04,972
[SPEAKER_08]: I felt like I should fill time.

2306
02:40:06,252 --> 02:40:08,233
[SPEAKER_08]: I just was slow in getting the Twitter loaded.

2307
02:40:09,053 --> 02:40:09,853
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think so.

2308
02:40:10,573 --> 02:40:11,093
[SPEAKER_04]: No, yes, I was.

2309
02:40:11,113 --> 02:40:13,494
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not what it sounded like because I had the feed up and running.

2310
02:40:14,194 --> 02:40:15,434
[SPEAKER_04]: Was the feed working now?

2311
02:40:15,454 --> 02:40:16,054
[SPEAKER_08]: Nobody was calling.

2312
02:40:16,834 --> 02:40:17,734
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, the feed was back.

2313
02:40:17,854 --> 02:40:19,015
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, then there you go.

2314
02:40:20,615 --> 02:40:21,635
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so I called.

2315
02:40:21,955 --> 02:40:23,955
[SPEAKER_08]: So Battlestar Galactica cease and desist.

2316
02:40:24,055 --> 02:40:25,836
[SPEAKER_08]: I love Battlestar Galactica.

2317
02:40:25,856 --> 02:40:26,816
[SPEAKER_08]: I can talk about that.

2318
02:40:29,104 --> 02:40:30,566
[SPEAKER_04]: It has nothing to do with the story.

2319
02:40:30,606 --> 02:40:31,667
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you even hear the story?

2320
02:40:32,288 --> 02:40:32,628
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

2321
02:40:33,529 --> 02:40:34,530
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, what was the story?

2322
02:40:35,772 --> 02:40:39,736
[SPEAKER_08]: NVC made them shut down some mod for some game that nobody plays.

2323
02:40:39,916 --> 02:40:40,417
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, good job.

2324
02:40:40,437 --> 02:40:41,098
[SPEAKER_08]: You passed the test.

2325
02:40:44,423 --> 02:40:47,124
[SPEAKER_04]: So are you sad that they had to take down the mods?

2326
02:40:47,384 --> 02:40:50,124
[SPEAKER_04]: If you love Battlestar Galactica so much, here's my real question.

2327
02:40:50,144 --> 02:40:51,845
[SPEAKER_04]: If you love it so much, why aren't you playing the MMO?

2328
02:40:52,425 --> 02:40:54,165
[SPEAKER_08]: I did for a day and it was terrible.

2329
02:40:54,345 --> 02:40:54,665
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

2330
02:40:54,705 --> 02:40:56,165
[SPEAKER_08]: So I didn't play it anymore.

2331
02:40:56,766 --> 02:40:57,646
[SPEAKER_08]: Why was it terrible?

2332
02:40:58,206 --> 02:41:00,046
[SPEAKER_08]: I couldn't control my Cylon ship.

2333
02:41:01,147 --> 02:41:03,887
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was like, this isn't realistic at all.

2334
02:41:04,327 --> 02:41:09,888
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd be making out with Helo or something equally as awesome.

2335
02:41:10,088 --> 02:41:12,569
[SPEAKER_08]: That's absolutely realistic, I'm sure.

2336
02:41:13,482 --> 02:41:38,000
[SPEAKER_04]: and Battlestar Galactica it would be because he loves Cylons and I was a Cylon alright alright, I'm hanging up on you to get some other calls, you've tied up the line okay, if there are finally people calling, that's fine bye, 1877 game OLR, or use name on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio so Miklatov's gone and we do have another call coming in, so let's see hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

2337
02:41:38,841 --> 02:41:42,304
[SPEAKER_04]: oh, it's Legend of Zaku hey, Legend of Zaku, how you doing?

2338
02:41:43,044 --> 02:41:43,464
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty good.

2339
02:41:43,484 --> 02:41:46,605
[SPEAKER_06]: Been doing stressful at work, but, you know, been hanging in there.

2340
02:41:47,205 --> 02:41:47,525
[SPEAKER_06]: I hear you.

2341
02:41:47,545 --> 02:41:48,025
[SPEAKER_06]: As usual.

2342
02:41:48,145 --> 02:41:49,326
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been stressful at my work, too.

2343
02:41:49,346 --> 02:41:50,046
[SPEAKER_04]: What's on your mind, buddy?

2344
02:41:51,646 --> 02:42:09,491
[SPEAKER_06]: Just the usual, you know, grasp of the fact that even though Steve Jobs did pass away, it's like his legacy in terms of how he's actually laid out a plan that might actually impact the way we view, you know, any, like, portable, dedicated gaming systems.

2345
02:42:10,011 --> 02:42:11,792
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just saying the fact that, you know,

2346
02:42:12,748 --> 02:42:15,971
[SPEAKER_06]: His passing has pretty much, you know, given me a little bit of time to reflect that.

2347
02:42:16,091 --> 02:42:25,800
[SPEAKER_06]: Mobile gaming might actually, you know, unless Nintendo gets into the business of selling phones, well, Sony's getting there, getting there, as long as they buy out Ericsson, then they'll be set.

2348
02:42:26,400 --> 02:42:31,085
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm more concerned about Nintendo and the fact that they just, like, shrug it off with a cavalier attitude.

2349
02:42:31,505 --> 02:42:37,130
[SPEAKER_02]: If Nintendo, you know, started selling phones, then they would have to acknowledge the fact that there's online and, well...

2350
02:42:39,046 --> 02:43:00,244
[SPEAKER_06]: and this is where these mobile game developers they target that audience where they're basically pissing in the same pool that Nintendo has spent hard cultivating ever since the days of the Game Boy but the idea is that they're going after the casuals I know it's a segment of the market that's like

2351
02:43:02,232 --> 02:43:08,319
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really hard to break in because these are people who aren't like, they're just typical folks.

2352
02:43:08,339 --> 02:43:10,842
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not like your average gamer.

2353
02:43:11,163 --> 02:43:16,749
[SPEAKER_06]: But the idea is that Nintendo, they're just shrugging it off.

2354
02:43:17,450 --> 02:43:20,173
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're being so naive about not adapting.

2355
02:43:20,794 --> 02:43:26,205
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, not realizing that the guys, you know, the creators of Angry Birds, at the end of the day, they're still going to make bank.

2356
02:43:26,986 --> 02:43:30,232
[SPEAKER_06]: While Nintendo's going to be scratching their head as to why they're not innovating.

2357
02:43:30,493 --> 02:43:31,816
[SPEAKER_06]: Why they're not staying ahead of the curve.

2358
02:43:34,019 --> 02:43:35,640
[SPEAKER_04]: But the Wii U!

2359
02:43:35,680 --> 02:43:37,601
[SPEAKER_04]: The Wii U is innovative!

2360
02:43:37,661 --> 02:43:39,242
[SPEAKER_04]: The Wii U, it's about you!

2361
02:43:39,703 --> 02:43:40,643
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's innovation.

2362
02:43:40,684 --> 02:43:41,044
[SPEAKER_04]: You!

2363
02:43:41,184 --> 02:43:42,285
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got the letter U!

2364
02:43:42,465 --> 02:43:52,232
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a Wii with a touch remote and supposed better graphics even though it's still being worked out Hold on, Zaku, hold on.

2365
02:43:52,852 --> 02:43:53,352
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold that thought.

2366
02:43:53,392 --> 02:43:54,373
[SPEAKER_04]: There's something really important.

2367
02:43:54,413 --> 02:43:54,974
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate to interrupt.

2368
02:43:55,014 --> 02:43:58,296
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, what are you really reading about Final Fantasy XIV over there?

2369
02:43:59,119 --> 02:44:00,279
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I was just curious.

2370
02:44:01,380 --> 02:44:01,880
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, dear.

2371
02:44:02,220 --> 02:44:03,160
[SPEAKER_11]: It doesn't mean I'm going to play it.

2372
02:44:03,200 --> 02:44:03,780
[SPEAKER_11]: I was just looking.

2373
02:44:04,920 --> 02:44:05,941
[SPEAKER_04]: You were experimenting?

2374
02:44:06,141 --> 02:44:08,241
[SPEAKER_04]: Did I catch you experimenting in the middle of the show?

2375
02:44:08,261 --> 02:44:09,242
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I was just looking.

2376
02:44:09,422 --> 02:44:09,762
[SPEAKER_11]: Shit.

2377
02:44:11,122 --> 02:44:12,002
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to give you crap.

2378
02:44:12,422 --> 02:44:12,722
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2379
02:44:13,163 --> 02:44:15,283
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, Zanku.

2380
02:44:15,343 --> 02:44:23,405
[SPEAKER_06]: If Nintendo were serious about trying to capture the casuals, they wouldn't have an arrogant tone.

2381
02:44:28,004 --> 02:44:30,726
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I hear from their bosses.

2382
02:44:31,066 --> 02:44:37,551
[SPEAKER_06]: They're hating on the Angry Birds folks, the indie devs.

2383
02:44:38,291 --> 02:44:43,575
[SPEAKER_06]: Because at the end of the day, they're going to be pissed when their lunch gets eaten by those guys.

2384
02:44:43,955 --> 02:44:47,057
[SPEAKER_04]: Steve Jobs' impact is going to be felt for a long time.

2385
02:44:47,177 --> 02:44:50,559
[SPEAKER_04]: You were mentioning about his style a little bit there at the beginning of the call.

2386
02:44:50,840 --> 02:44:56,524
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you hear that news report about that they're going to have executives be taught on his styles?

2387
02:44:57,364 --> 02:44:58,124
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's the thing.

2388
02:44:58,164 --> 02:45:06,546
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't really teach anyone else that type of style because you're born with that ability to be a perfectionist.

2389
02:45:07,666 --> 02:45:12,748
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't really teach an artist, especially one that's born into it, born with that talent.

2390
02:45:12,788 --> 02:45:23,010
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, sure, they can become artists and they grow to realize that they have the talent within them, but you can't just force that person to be a perfectionist, to be as meticulous as he was.

2391
02:45:23,630 --> 02:45:25,191
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel bad for that new guy a little bit.

2392
02:45:25,211 --> 02:45:32,397
[SPEAKER_06]: The fact that he managed to change my industry, which I actually do work in mobile.

2393
02:45:32,617 --> 02:45:39,362
[SPEAKER_06]: The day the iPhone came out, I realized that history was changing with that very same bloke.

2394
02:45:40,223 --> 02:45:41,244
[SPEAKER_06]: Who would have ever thought that

2395
02:45:41,974 --> 02:45:42,394
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

2396
02:46:01,921 --> 02:46:06,282
[SPEAKER_04]: His first big press conference is about the iPhone 4S, which is really more of an upgrade.

2397
02:46:06,302 --> 02:46:07,102
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that was shocking.

2398
02:46:07,142 --> 02:46:12,464
[SPEAKER_06]: The fact that they couldn't even announce something greater than the iPhone 4.

2399
02:46:12,524 --> 02:46:13,684
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, here's the problem.

2400
02:46:13,744 --> 02:46:14,444
[SPEAKER_04]: It is what it is.

2401
02:46:14,624 --> 02:46:17,905
[SPEAKER_04]: If Jobs had still been around, that would have been his announcement to make anyway.

2402
02:46:18,025 --> 02:46:18,565
[SPEAKER_04]: But think about this.

2403
02:46:18,965 --> 02:46:19,486
[SPEAKER_04]: He knew.

2404
02:46:19,786 --> 02:46:24,727
[SPEAKER_04]: Tim Cook had to know when he was up on that stage that the former CEO was... I mean, he knew.

2405
02:46:24,967 --> 02:46:26,127
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure he was being up there.

2406
02:46:26,727 --> 02:46:28,288
[SPEAKER_04]: He knew that Steve Jobs was about to die.

2407
02:46:29,249 --> 02:46:33,195
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that was already known the day he stepped down.

2408
02:46:33,255 --> 02:46:34,838
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was months ago.

2409
02:46:34,858 --> 02:46:38,483
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm talking the difference between in a couple months and today or tomorrow.

2410
02:46:40,441 --> 02:46:50,728
[SPEAKER_06]: But the idea is that he paved the way in the fact that mobile gaming has exploded in the past four to five years.

2411
02:46:51,228 --> 02:46:58,974
[SPEAKER_06]: It used to be a small niche market that only folks who had the money to pay for those shitty games for those devices back then.

2412
02:46:59,014 --> 02:47:05,858
[SPEAKER_06]: But now it's like the quality is getting to the point where it might even rival whatever Sony and Nintendo is actually spitting out.

2413
02:47:06,619 --> 02:47:09,061
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, if you look at the fact that these phones are like...

2414
02:47:09,841 --> 02:47:34,789
[SPEAKER_06]: it's cheaper than the Vita itself they start cheaper than the Vita and they have just about the same number of games and the fact that the quality is damn near almost PS2 level for a device no greater than 4 inches yeah that's pretty impressive alright Zach I gotta let you go so we can wrap up but thank you for your call

2415
02:47:35,939 --> 02:47:36,860
[SPEAKER_04]: Take care, buddy.

2416
02:47:37,380 --> 02:47:37,600
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye.

2417
02:47:53,698 --> 02:47:55,979
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, that's going to do it for calls tonight.

2418
02:47:56,019 --> 02:47:58,860
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry to those that didn't get through, but be sure to send us an email for next week.

2419
02:47:58,900 --> 02:48:02,301
[SPEAKER_04]: Mailbag at orangelaundry.com Or you could always send us a tweet.

2420
02:48:02,381 --> 02:48:08,783
[SPEAKER_04]: Twitter.com slash OLR I want to quickly, quickly read one more tweet here from TigerClaw because I didn't get to this.

2421
02:48:09,544 --> 02:48:21,668
[SPEAKER_04]: He sent a story from Gamasutra about this is kind of a longer article, but I guess the headline is Game Developer Conference Online WebWise Kids Team for Game Promoting Online Child Safety

2422
02:48:22,228 --> 02:48:28,091
[SPEAKER_04]: So Webwise Kids is the game, or no, is the company, and I guess they're just promoting children being safe online.

2423
02:48:28,251 --> 02:48:31,893
[SPEAKER_04]: I would assume like not sharing, oversharing personal details and so forth.

2424
02:48:33,074 --> 02:48:34,895
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a free title that the saying is out there.

2425
02:48:34,935 --> 02:48:42,038
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called Passing the Ball, and it's an action game that follows a parent and their child as they learn an important lesson about working together.

2426
02:48:42,098 --> 02:48:48,582
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that would be passing a ball, which to me sounds a lot like you jump to a conclusion.

2427
02:48:53,114 --> 02:49:00,539
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a donation link within Passing the Ball so you can make a donation to Webwise Kids.

2428
02:49:01,740 --> 02:49:05,342
[SPEAKER_04]: They will be doing something with the Game Developers Conference event in San Francisco.

2429
02:49:06,102 --> 02:49:12,006
[SPEAKER_04]: The initiative will include a one-day Gamers for Change event created by the same non-profit team.

2430
02:49:12,786 --> 02:49:27,393
[SPEAKER_04]: In addition to commissioning the game for web-wide kids and adding the donate link to the game, $1,000 was directly donated to this network to help the programs to promote a culture of safety, responsibility, and respect for youth and families in the digital world.

2431
02:49:28,573 --> 02:49:37,637
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, watch your damn kids and make sure if they have a Facebook, A, they ought to be at least like 13 or 14, but B, if they aren't, you're monitoring it.

2432
02:49:37,677 --> 02:49:38,938
[SPEAKER_04]: You know exactly what they're doing.

2433
02:49:39,038 --> 02:49:40,098
[SPEAKER_04]: I have heard of really young kids.

2434
02:49:40,118 --> 02:49:41,059
[SPEAKER_11]: Permanently blind them.

2435
02:49:41,639 --> 02:49:51,528
[SPEAKER_04]: I have, well, I have heard about really young kids with Facebook accounts mostly to play the games, which is fine as long as the parent is kind of, you know, has, has watching out of the corner of their eye, you know, what they're doing.

2436
02:49:51,588 --> 02:49:53,710
[SPEAKER_04]: Although I think... They should be standing there looking over their shoulder.

2437
02:49:54,488 --> 02:49:56,189
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yes and no.

2438
02:49:56,710 --> 02:49:58,391
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you can't put the child on it.

2439
02:49:58,491 --> 02:50:00,353
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, at the end of the day, it's up to the parent.

2440
02:50:00,373 --> 02:50:00,793
[SPEAKER_04]: That's fine.

2441
02:50:01,274 --> 02:50:04,797
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think, and sometimes you should sit there and play the game with them.

2442
02:50:04,857 --> 02:50:07,819
[SPEAKER_04]: But maybe there's times where you kind of get it loaded for them.

2443
02:50:07,839 --> 02:50:09,581
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you can walk away for a couple minutes.

2444
02:50:09,961 --> 02:50:11,762
[SPEAKER_04]: Give that child a sense of safety or whatever.

2445
02:50:11,823 --> 02:50:14,064
[SPEAKER_04]: Make sure that when you walk back, that's what they're still doing.

2446
02:50:14,965 --> 02:50:15,325
[SPEAKER_04]: You know.

2447
02:50:15,886 --> 02:50:16,707
[SPEAKER_11]: Porn friends.

2448
02:50:17,407 --> 02:50:17,948
[SPEAKER_11]: Pornville.

2449
02:50:18,348 --> 02:50:19,169
[SPEAKER_04]: Not Pornville.

2450
02:50:20,049 --> 02:50:20,510
[SPEAKER_04]: Forget it.

2451
02:50:21,491 --> 02:50:21,871
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2452
02:50:23,854 --> 02:50:24,355
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

2453
02:50:24,455 --> 02:50:26,837
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to do it for another week here at Orange Lounge Radio.

2454
02:50:26,897 --> 02:50:29,640
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, but I did miss one little thing we got to do.

2455
02:50:29,740 --> 02:50:31,082
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Loki, for pointing this out.

2456
02:50:31,122 --> 02:50:32,123
[SPEAKER_04]: I totally missed this earlier.

2457
02:50:32,223 --> 02:50:32,703
[SPEAKER_04]: What can I say?

2458
02:50:32,723 --> 02:50:33,484
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm out of practice.

2459
02:50:34,185 --> 02:50:35,887
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's time for the FUs of the week.

2460
02:50:52,000 --> 02:50:55,085
[SPEAKER_11]: F you to people who don't do their damn part.

2461
02:50:56,386 --> 02:50:56,747
[SPEAKER_11]: That's it.

2462
02:51:02,711 --> 02:51:30,696
[SPEAKER_02]: Firewall at work that doesn't allow us to play live very well because of our strict NAT settings and it's funny our IT guy actually opened the NAT ports for my system made it worse so that's great fortunately they're going to be installing a new firewall in a couple weeks and if that doesn't work he's going to put our systems outside the firewall so that hopefully that won't be a problem

2463
02:51:32,276 --> 02:51:34,058
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, FU to Headaches.

2464
02:51:34,238 --> 02:51:37,162
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been getting some huge ones today and it's not been good.

2465
02:51:37,402 --> 02:51:38,744
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm very sad.

2466
02:51:39,765 --> 02:51:43,710
[SPEAKER_04]: But I did really wear myself out yesterday so that could be part of the reason why.

2467
02:51:44,491 --> 02:51:45,852
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I don't know.

2468
02:51:46,813 --> 02:51:47,875
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it for the FU's of the week.

2469
02:51:49,076 --> 02:51:50,537
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we can start to wrap up the show.

2470
02:51:51,017 --> 02:51:55,618
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I gotta ask Loki, do you have any last minute stories for us?

2471
02:51:55,778 --> 02:51:56,018
[SPEAKER_02]: No?

2472
02:51:56,898 --> 02:51:57,799
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not gonna look anything up.

2473
02:51:58,179 --> 02:51:58,439
[SPEAKER_04]: Fine.

2474
02:51:59,239 --> 02:52:01,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we'll go around and get everybody's final thought.

2475
02:52:01,740 --> 02:52:02,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, we'll start with you.

2476
02:52:03,100 --> 02:52:10,303
[SPEAKER_02]: My final thought is opening on the 12th, we'll be voting for the podcast awards.

2477
02:52:10,503 --> 02:52:11,843
[SPEAKER_02]: So don't forget to vote every day.

2478
02:52:12,663 --> 02:52:13,264
[SPEAKER_02]: Every single day.

2479
02:52:13,324 --> 02:52:14,004
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell your friends.

2480
02:52:16,045 --> 02:52:16,665
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell your enemies.

2481
02:52:17,166 --> 02:52:19,268
[SPEAKER_02]: Just make sure you vote every single day.

2482
02:52:19,548 --> 02:52:20,869
[SPEAKER_11]: And especially tell your frenemies.

2483
02:52:21,650 --> 02:52:23,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

2484
02:52:23,411 --> 02:52:25,152
[SPEAKER_04]: My final thought is tacos.

2485
02:52:26,613 --> 02:52:29,676
[SPEAKER_04]: If we win the podcast award, we will celebrate with a taco party.

2486
02:52:29,736 --> 02:52:30,316
[SPEAKER_04]: That's for sure.

2487
02:52:32,118 --> 02:52:32,378
[SPEAKER_04]: Shit.

2488
02:52:33,179 --> 02:52:34,780
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that your final thought tonight, DarkSakura?

2489
02:52:34,800 --> 02:52:35,981
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that's my final thought.

2490
02:52:37,362 --> 02:52:37,923
[SPEAKER_11]: Fuck shit.

2491
02:52:40,734 --> 02:52:41,354
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

2492
02:52:41,455 --> 02:52:42,675
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a wonderful night everybody.

2493
02:52:42,735 --> 02:52:45,998
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for tuning in and supporting Orange Launch Radio as you always do.

2494
02:52:46,118 --> 02:52:47,799
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, if you like the show, always ask.

2495
02:52:47,879 --> 02:52:48,820
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell a friend about the show.

2496
02:52:48,860 --> 02:52:49,520
[SPEAKER_04]: Help spread the word.

2497
02:52:49,540 --> 02:52:51,021
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember guys, we don't have advertising dollars.

2498
02:52:51,361 --> 02:53:02,189
[SPEAKER_04]: It's part of the reason that we were hoping we'd get nominated for the podcast award is because it's great exposure and we don't have a big magazine or a giant website that backs us up.

2499
02:53:02,569 --> 02:53:05,751
[SPEAKER_04]: So thanks again as always for your help in helping us spread the word.

2500
02:53:06,191 --> 02:53:07,072
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll see you next week.

2501
02:53:07,112 --> 02:53:09,334
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll do it all again with another week of Orange Launch Radio.

2502
02:53:09,374 --> 02:53:09,814
[SPEAKER_04]: Until then...

2503
02:53:10,995 --> 02:53:35,896
