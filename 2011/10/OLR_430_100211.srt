1
00:00:14,983 --> 00:00:18,585
[SPEAKER_05]: More lies, more lies, more lies.

2
00:00:18,605 --> 00:00:20,406
[SPEAKER_03]: This will be edited out later.

3
00:00:20,446 --> 00:00:20,566
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.

4
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:38,523
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, welcome to episode 430 of Orange Lounge Radio.

[SPEAKER_03]: And Rob's not here.

00:00:42,966 --> 00:00:48,069
[SPEAKER_03]: No, actually, we are the show that tells gamers what they really want to know.

10
00:00:53,353 --> 00:00:53,573
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi.

11
00:00:54,394 --> 00:01:00,338
[SPEAKER_03]: And our special guest tonight is some dude that I picked up on the internet, Dan.

12
00:01:02,019 --> 00:01:02,459
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a hobo.

13
00:01:03,464 --> 00:01:08,550
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so again, it's Sunday night, 6 o'clock Pacific time.

[SPEAKER_03]: And you can join us on allgames.com and listen to us live and hang out in our chat room at allgames.com.

15
00:01:15,958 --> 00:01:16,999
[SPEAKER_03]: Why am I not allgames.com?

16
00:01:17,019 --> 00:01:17,760
[SPEAKER_03]: That's Bobby's chat room.

17
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,703
[SPEAKER_03]: At Orange Lounge, in Pound Orange Lounge.

[SPEAKER_03]: And you can also follow the chat at orangeloungeradio.com.

19
00:01:25,268 --> 00:01:39,140
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, it's another derpisode because Rob's not here and I'm kind of ill-prepared So why don't we just go ahead and skip the formalities and go to how was our gaming week And mine, I played WoW for 20 minutes a day every day, that's it Loki?

20
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:40,041
[SPEAKER_00]: Just 20 minutes?

21
00:01:40,561 --> 00:01:47,287
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty much, except for the other night when I was doing the pet hunt How do you even play WoW for 20 minutes?

22
00:01:47,788 --> 00:01:50,230
[SPEAKER_02]: I just go on to do dailies Wow

23
00:01:53,174 --> 00:02:05,965
[SPEAKER_00]: I played quite a few things actually this week besides the usual stuff more Grand Theft Auto, more Earth Defense Force Insect Armageddon I did play a few things including some stuff I should be playing

24
00:02:08,888 --> 00:02:25,765
[SPEAKER_00]: Tiny Tower, I played a little bit of that just because I realized that there is an update to it and I did the update and bought the two extra shops of each kind and a few extra residential floors and added those all in there and my tower is super huge.

25
00:02:26,105 --> 00:02:26,986
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching!

26
00:02:43,397 --> 00:02:43,617
[SPEAKER_00]: I did.

27
00:02:44,358 --> 00:02:53,160
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also on iOS, I checked out Katamari Amore, which is the new Katamari game for the iPod, iPad, iPhone.

28
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,141
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's alright.

29
00:02:55,201 --> 00:03:03,383
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, I don't really care too much for touchscreen controls for a lot of stuff, especially when it comes to virtual thumbsticks, but

30
00:03:04,004 --> 00:03:05,386
[SPEAKER_00]: It's alright, it works pretty good.

31
00:03:06,127 --> 00:03:15,360
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can check out the free version, which is basically just a time trial level that's only two minutes long.

32
00:03:16,001 --> 00:03:18,886
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want the rest of it, you can buy the download pack, which is $3.99.

33
00:03:20,785 --> 00:03:25,488
[SPEAKER_00]: It's alright, but definitely if you're thinking about picking it up, try the demo first.

34
00:03:26,188 --> 00:03:29,910
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you like it, then go ahead and pay for the full thing.

35
00:03:31,171 --> 00:03:36,514
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, the other thing I really shouldn't have been playing is a leaked game that came out.

36
00:03:37,535 --> 00:03:41,437
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a leaked Xbox Live arcade game called Saints Row Money Shot.

37
00:03:41,557 --> 00:03:43,278
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm not sure if this is actually a game that got...

38
00:03:43,618 --> 00:03:44,940
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching!

39
00:03:54,145 --> 00:03:57,068
[SPEAKER_00]: Unlocks for Saints Row the Third in the game itself.

40
00:03:57,188 --> 00:04:02,373
[SPEAKER_00]: You can unlock the hover bike and this sniper outfit and one of the sniper rifles.

41
00:04:03,033 --> 00:04:19,769
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically the whole game's premise is very similar to the movie Wanted or at least a section of it where you're firing the sniper rifle and actually controlling the trajectory of the bullet as you're flying to your intended target.

42
00:04:20,869 --> 00:04:24,250
[SPEAKER_00]: You can hit different things that interact with the environment.

43
00:04:25,011 --> 00:04:33,134
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have different goals like kill three pigeons, get a bunch of close calls, and that kind of thing.

44
00:04:33,274 --> 00:04:40,476
[SPEAKER_00]: You unlock different bullets to have more speed, more turning ability, that kind of stuff.

45
00:04:40,556 --> 00:04:44,898
[SPEAKER_00]: Seriously, when they're moving faster, it's a lot harder to actually play the game, but

46
00:04:45,998 --> 00:05:03,183
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, some of the cool stuff you can do, you know, there's one part where you hit a wine bottle of this couple that's, you know, sitting there having a nice dinner in their, you know, condo or apartment and that unfortunately causes the bottle to shatter and hit the candle that's on the table and they both catch on fire.

47
00:05:03,863 --> 00:05:12,386
[SPEAKER_00]: Or another one where it knocks out the cane of an old woman and there's implied, you know, oral sex there and funny stuff like that.

48
00:05:12,546 --> 00:05:12,886
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh,

49
00:05:13,993 --> 00:05:14,534
[SPEAKER_00]: Rated E for Everyone

50
00:05:23,945 --> 00:05:29,587
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely not the Saints Row drive-by game that was supposed to become an Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network.

51
00:05:30,027 --> 00:05:34,889
[SPEAKER_00]: That was going to be kind of like its own thing, and that was the one that was supposed to become the 3DS.

52
00:05:35,829 --> 00:05:40,490
[SPEAKER_00]: But this game may very well come to Xbox Live Arcade.

53
00:05:41,431 --> 00:05:44,652
[SPEAKER_00]: I would imagine this month, if it's going to come at all.

54
00:05:47,054 --> 00:06:14,215
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, it was alright it was a little bit boring because there's only really three story levels the rest are kind of practice training levels but then again this isn't really a finished build of the game it's something that came out back in June but I don't know it'll be cool, I definitely would want to check out the full version if it did come out just at the very least for the unlocks and that's pretty much it, that's all I've been playing

55
00:06:17,981 --> 00:06:19,022
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, sweetie?

56
00:06:20,062 --> 00:06:20,382
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes?

57
00:06:20,763 --> 00:06:21,563
[SPEAKER_03]: What have you been playing?

58
00:06:23,924 --> 00:06:25,185
[SPEAKER_07]: I played some Tetris DS.

59
00:06:25,705 --> 00:06:26,426
[SPEAKER_07]: Woo!

60
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:27,866
[SPEAKER_03]: You've been watching a lot of videos.

61
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:32,369
[SPEAKER_07]: I spent a little time in the vault last week and played some Genesis stuff.

62
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:35,310
[SPEAKER_07]: Besides that, nothing really current.

63
00:06:36,711 --> 00:06:38,332
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but you have been watching a lot of videos.

64
00:06:38,932 --> 00:06:39,633
[SPEAKER_07]: I watched a couple.

65
00:06:40,493 --> 00:06:41,874
[SPEAKER_07]: I watched a playthrough of Sapphire today.

66
00:06:42,034 --> 00:06:42,954
[SPEAKER_07]: That was kind of a cool game.

67
00:06:43,395 --> 00:06:43,995
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that game.

68
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:45,881
[SPEAKER_07]: You didn't even know what it was.

69
00:06:45,941 --> 00:06:46,401
[SPEAKER_07]: What's this?

70
00:06:46,681 --> 00:06:49,762
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, no, I just walked in and it looked like a tank game for a minute.

71
00:06:49,782 --> 00:06:50,682
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, wait, that's not a tank game.

72
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:51,643
[SPEAKER_07]: It didn't look like a tank game at all.

73
00:06:51,663 --> 00:06:53,843
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a big skull and I forgot that level, so shut up.

74
00:06:54,043 --> 00:06:55,564
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what you're talking about.

75
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:57,344
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, you're fired.

76
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:58,244
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah.

77
00:07:00,245 --> 00:07:01,445
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone, Dan's kicked off the show.

78
00:07:01,965 --> 00:07:02,465
[SPEAKER_07]: Damn it.

79
00:07:03,485 --> 00:07:04,346
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, you're rehired.

80
00:07:05,126 --> 00:07:06,266
[SPEAKER_03]: If you go get me something to drink.

81
00:07:07,526 --> 00:07:07,666
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

82
00:07:08,847 --> 00:07:09,607
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, you're fired again.

83
00:07:11,357 --> 00:07:15,040
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway, a little bit of housekeeping.

84
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,982
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, Rob's at Disneyland.

85
00:07:17,782 --> 00:07:18,903
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're all super jealous.

86
00:07:19,704 --> 00:07:20,464
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, at least I am.

87
00:07:21,825 --> 00:07:22,746
[SPEAKER_03]: Dan, are you super jealous?

88
00:07:23,687 --> 00:07:26,309
[SPEAKER_07]: I really want to see Space Mountain Ghost Galaxy.

89
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:30,272
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if all plans out, we're going.

90
00:07:30,693 --> 00:07:31,153
[SPEAKER_03]: But not now.

91
00:07:32,214 --> 00:07:32,354
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe.

92
00:07:32,374 --> 00:07:32,474
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe.

93
00:07:32,922 --> 00:07:33,223
[SPEAKER_03]: Never.

94
00:07:34,104 --> 00:07:41,276
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway, let's go ahead and move on from, let's move past Rob's absence and I'm over it.

95
00:07:41,376 --> 00:07:41,857
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm over it.

96
00:07:41,977 --> 00:07:43,740
[SPEAKER_03]: I was a little upset for a while, but now I'm over it.

97
00:07:44,461 --> 00:07:46,464
[SPEAKER_03]: So how about we launch into the first story?

98
00:07:46,957 --> 00:07:47,317
[SPEAKER_00]: XBOX 360 DASHBOARD

99
00:08:05,053 --> 00:08:27,402
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is going to be part of the new dashboard, they're going to be adding PayPal payments It's listed the release of this as November 15th And of course the dashboard update kind of refreshes the whole look of it Kind of gives it the Windows Phone, Windows 8 kind of look to the whole thing Which I kind of hate, but whatever Um

100
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:30,871
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching!

101
00:08:47,594 --> 00:08:48,214
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have that.

102
00:08:48,374 --> 00:08:57,017
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, some more information regarding the supposed Xbox TV service they're going to be having.

103
00:08:57,978 --> 00:09:02,159
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the content providers that they're going to be featuring on this, according to Bloomberg.

104
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:12,903
[SPEAKER_00]: Comcast, Verizon, they're also expecting to get HBO, Crackle, Bravo, SyFy, Love Film, and a lot more.

105
00:09:16,341 --> 00:09:20,084
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess also some stuff from Amazon as well.

106
00:09:20,445 --> 00:09:28,090
[SPEAKER_00]: So it looks like they're going to be trying to source content from, I think not only just cable providers, but actual cable content providers.

107
00:09:30,345 --> 00:09:53,733
[SPEAKER_00]: on top of just actual the cable companies so maybe for example if you don't have cable you may not be just locked out of all this which would be nice because I would prefer not to have cable but getting a somewhat okay deal right now but in the years time that may change and it'd be nice to have some extra sources of content other than the internet.

108
00:09:55,313 --> 00:10:12,199
[SPEAKER_00]: and of course I'll probably get a nice little peek of this pretty soon considering that the dev kit dashboard update that's the preview for this fall thing also leaked to the internet and been taken down pretty quickly but

109
00:10:13,739 --> 00:10:19,765
[SPEAKER_00]: Happened to snag a copy for my dev kit before it did get taken down, so I will get a chance to check that out.

110
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:26,852
[SPEAKER_00]: Although, based on the YouTube videos I've seen, it's still rather boring because it's basically what you see in the screenshots.

111
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:29,896
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it's an Xbox menu.

112
00:10:30,716 --> 00:10:35,401
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's like, I don't understand, with each update, they kind of make it worse.

113
00:10:35,761 --> 00:10:37,283
[SPEAKER_07]: Bring back the blades, damn it.

114
00:10:38,106 --> 00:10:40,068
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's what I use pretty much now anyways.

115
00:10:40,128 --> 00:10:40,889
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the blades.

116
00:10:40,949 --> 00:10:42,751
[SPEAKER_00]: Just hit the guide button, the blades come up.

117
00:10:42,811 --> 00:10:49,598
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm hoping that's still the case with this because I just really don't care for the new update.

118
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:50,960
[SPEAKER_00]: And I understand why they're doing it.

119
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:54,524
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because they can say, hey, look at all this ad space we've got.

120
00:10:54,644 --> 00:10:56,106
[SPEAKER_00]: We can advertise games.

121
00:10:56,146 --> 00:10:57,387
[SPEAKER_00]: We can advertise services.

122
00:10:57,427 --> 00:10:58,828
[SPEAKER_00]: We can have third-party ads.

123
00:10:59,609 --> 00:11:01,951
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really what it's come down to.

124
00:11:02,731 --> 00:11:06,393
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of scary if you think about it because they're going to do the same thing with Windows 8.

125
00:11:06,773 --> 00:11:10,676
[SPEAKER_00]: Thankfully, Windows 8, you can turn that off, kind of like you can turn off Media Center.

126
00:11:12,497 --> 00:11:12,897
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

127
00:11:12,977 --> 00:11:16,359
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish it was optional like Media Center.

128
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:22,543
[SPEAKER_00]: I would think by now we have the technology to where we can customize the way that the dashboard looks.

129
00:11:23,123 --> 00:11:25,424
[SPEAKER_00]: If I want the Windows 8 look, cool, I can do that.

130
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:27,906
[SPEAKER_00]: If I want the old one, cool, I should be able to do that as well.

131
00:11:28,353 --> 00:11:38,122
[SPEAKER_07]: you know what I like about the updates to the dashboard and it's not really even specific to the dashboard but just part of the whole update package I like the fact that they stopped making the avatars look retarded

132
00:11:39,042 --> 00:11:45,464
[SPEAKER_07]: They're like reproportioned a little bit so their heads aren't all stupidly huge and they look a little bit more like people but they still look like avatars.

133
00:11:46,084 --> 00:11:46,704
[SPEAKER_07]: That's awesome.

134
00:11:47,544 --> 00:11:48,885
[SPEAKER_03]: The Miis still look like bobbleheads.

135
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:50,865
[SPEAKER_03]: They're supposed to look like bobbleheads.

136
00:11:50,905 --> 00:11:51,845
[SPEAKER_07]: Miis always sucked.

137
00:11:52,225 --> 00:11:56,367
[SPEAKER_03]: The Xbox ones I thought weren't supposed to have that bobbleheaded look so I like it too.

138
00:11:56,607 --> 00:11:56,787
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

139
00:11:56,887 --> 00:12:01,848
[SPEAKER_07]: The avatars are like kind of neat but the Miis, yeah, were always just sort of creepy looking.

140
00:12:02,495 --> 00:12:02,695
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

141
00:12:03,575 --> 00:12:03,756
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

142
00:12:05,596 --> 00:12:06,957
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I don't know.

143
00:12:07,277 --> 00:12:10,258
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll just... It's only, what, a month away?

144
00:12:10,498 --> 00:12:13,400
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean... Whatever.

145
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:18,562
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just glad I'm not participating in the fall preview because I fucking hated that.

146
00:12:18,902 --> 00:12:21,683
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like, oh, hey, look, we're pushing another dashboard update to you.

147
00:12:22,383 --> 00:12:23,104
[SPEAKER_00]: Every day.

148
00:12:23,444 --> 00:12:24,204
[SPEAKER_00]: Twice a day.

149
00:12:24,304 --> 00:12:28,426
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, oh, I have to sit here for another ten minutes while this shit downloads.

150
00:12:29,955 --> 00:12:54,823
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't worth it And I didn't even get anything free out of it Like the people that tested Was it the last dashboard thing with the XGT 3 stuff Where you got a free copy of Reach That didn't even work Well at least when they updated it Well you still get a games on demand version Sweet Yeah it's not too bad If you don't like hard drive space It's great

151
00:12:56,888 --> 00:12:57,248
[SPEAKER_07]: My turn?

152
00:12:57,809 --> 00:12:58,069
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

153
00:12:58,269 --> 00:12:58,749
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

154
00:12:59,170 --> 00:12:59,990
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, guess what?

155
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:03,572
[SPEAKER_07]: Microsoft's coming out with a new Windows phone that nobody's going to buy.

156
00:13:03,912 --> 00:13:04,653
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's surprised?

157
00:13:04,773 --> 00:13:11,596
[SPEAKER_07]: It has swappable controller pads so you can have a keyboard, a touchscreen, an extended battery, or a game controller.

158
00:13:12,097 --> 00:13:15,859
[SPEAKER_07]: The problem is it's a Windows phone and everybody hates Windows phones.

159
00:13:16,659 --> 00:13:17,880
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally hate Windows phones.

160
00:13:18,191 --> 00:13:19,652
[SPEAKER_00]: Microsoft doesn't hate Windows phones.

161
00:13:19,692 --> 00:13:25,057
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, after all, they're redesigning Windows to look like they're Windows phones.

162
00:13:25,798 --> 00:13:28,000
[SPEAKER_07]: They're just redesigning Windows to work on tablets.

163
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,142
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the future for Microsoft.

164
00:13:30,162 --> 00:13:32,284
[SPEAKER_07]: They want to get into the tablet business.

165
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:33,806
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can turn it off.

166
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:35,581
[SPEAKER_07]: What, the phone?

167
00:13:35,801 --> 00:13:36,862
[SPEAKER_03]: No, with the PC version.

168
00:13:37,723 --> 00:13:38,224
[SPEAKER_00]: Turn what off?

169
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:41,608
[SPEAKER_03]: You can turn off that tablet interface and go back to a classic interface on Windows 8.

170
00:13:41,648 --> 00:13:46,114
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I understand that, but the damages are even done as far as... You mean you can make Windows look like Windows?

171
00:13:46,775 --> 00:13:47,696
[SPEAKER_07]: Score!

172
00:13:49,867 --> 00:13:53,288
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really sad that they took out the support to make Windows look like Windows 3.1.

173
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,390
[SPEAKER_07]: You can make Windows look like old Windows?

174
00:13:58,890 --> 00:13:59,391
[SPEAKER_07]: Score!

175
00:13:59,751 --> 00:14:02,772
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, I am so ready for Windows to be radically different.

176
00:14:03,392 --> 00:14:04,353
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's fine.

177
00:14:04,413 --> 00:14:06,954
[SPEAKER_07]: Windows is Windows, and you're used to Windows being what it is.

178
00:14:07,034 --> 00:14:13,376
[SPEAKER_07]: But it is sort of like, man, I sure would like to see Windows do something different.

179
00:14:14,042 --> 00:14:22,510
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't really think Windows now, I mean, there's not anything I've done and said, you know, I really wish Windows 7 did this.

180
00:14:23,952 --> 00:14:25,073
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fine with Windows 7.

181
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:27,075
[SPEAKER_00]: Windows 7 does everything I need it to do.

182
00:14:27,275 --> 00:14:31,059
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need to interact with social networks any more than I already am.

183
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,242
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need them to post an update.

184
00:14:34,962 --> 00:14:36,264
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt just opened Calculator.

185
00:14:37,602 --> 00:15:03,637
[SPEAKER_07]: no one fucking cares you know what's gonna happen is they're gonna get this whole thing with perfect social network integration and right then the whole world's gonna be like we're done with social networks let's move on to something else that's lame you know what when I looked at your article that top attachment I swear looked like a Wiimote that's right it's the new Wii Microsoft phone Mike I got nothing

186
00:15:04,471 --> 00:15:05,012
[SPEAKER_03]: Microwee.

187
00:15:06,674 --> 00:15:06,995
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.

188
00:15:07,736 --> 00:15:08,156
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

189
00:15:09,378 --> 00:15:09,999
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I don't know.

190
00:15:10,039 --> 00:15:12,743
[SPEAKER_03]: That kind of goes with what our friend used to call Microsoft Microflacid.

191
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:19,512
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, how about some news that makes everybody happy because it has to do with Portal.

192
00:15:20,612 --> 00:15:31,176
[SPEAKER_03]: There is new download content for Portal 2 which is called Peer Review and it is a free download for PC, PS3, and Xbox 360 available on October 4th.

193
00:15:32,217 --> 00:15:42,361
[SPEAKER_03]: It has more of the co-op modes for Atlas and Peabody who are the cutie little robots that like to hug so much and hey, this article has my desktop wallpaper on it.

194
00:15:43,081 --> 00:15:45,903
[SPEAKER_03]: Gladass will be there, so that's going to be cool.

195
00:15:46,043 --> 00:15:49,926
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's also a challenge mode for co-op and single player that has leaderboard support.

196
00:15:50,847 --> 00:16:03,055
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you want some more free stuff, the third and fourth group of tracks from the Portal 2 soundtrack, Music to Test By, is on Valve's site right now, which I need to download them.

197
00:16:03,176 --> 00:16:06,658
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably some more ringtones and message sounds, I bet.

198
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:08,920
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.

199
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,982
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually have the Turret Symphony as one of my ringtones.

200
00:16:14,622 --> 00:16:18,980
[SPEAKER_03]: The little one that you hear the four little turrets practicing in the little level.

201
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,265
[SPEAKER_07]: You must be so proud.

202
00:16:21,155 --> 00:16:22,076
[SPEAKER_03]: I am, shut up.

203
00:16:22,096 --> 00:16:24,518
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not proud of your face.

204
00:16:26,779 --> 00:16:28,421
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, well that's it for that one.

205
00:16:29,161 --> 00:16:43,312
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is a little bit interesting and a little bit disappointing because I kind of, I read this and you know, I was craving Subway anyways because I had a coupon for it and although it wasn't for the store I went to.

206
00:16:43,332 --> 00:16:44,733
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, why do you need a coupon for Subway?

207
00:16:44,793 --> 00:16:45,273
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all $5 anyway.

208
00:16:46,437 --> 00:16:47,318
[SPEAKER_00]: Uncharted 3 Uncharted 3

209
00:17:15,675 --> 00:17:16,216
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, I saw that.

210
00:17:16,236 --> 00:17:16,958
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have got a drink.

211
00:17:20,543 --> 00:17:22,663
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a 30 ounce drink.

212
00:17:23,063 --> 00:17:38,966
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, not only do you get a PlayStation Network code for that to play the multiplayer portion of the game, but you also get an exclusive item which earns you the ability to do the subway footlong taunt.

213
00:17:39,146 --> 00:17:42,087
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the $5 footlong thing that they do in the commercials?

214
00:17:42,287 --> 00:17:42,667
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.

215
00:17:43,067 --> 00:17:48,148
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have that taunt as well that you can earn from getting a drink.

216
00:17:48,502 --> 00:17:50,623
[SPEAKER_00]: And here I was all ready to get a drink.

217
00:17:50,763 --> 00:17:53,465
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact... You even got a drink.

218
00:17:53,705 --> 00:17:54,325
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, no.

219
00:17:54,606 --> 00:18:03,911
[SPEAKER_00]: To go back to what I was talking about earlier before the show started, how the person at Subway was really stupid, I asked for a large drink, and she rang me up for a small drink.

220
00:18:04,431 --> 00:18:05,752
[SPEAKER_00]: Because she is stupid.

221
00:18:06,632 --> 00:18:08,653
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you reach across the counter and pimp-slop her?

222
00:18:08,934 --> 00:18:14,857
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have, but once again, though, I looked at their cups, and their cups did not have the new stuff on them.

223
00:18:15,307 --> 00:18:23,273
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure that participation will vary by location based on whether they're phasing out their old inventory or not.

224
00:18:23,573 --> 00:18:26,015
[SPEAKER_07]: Often those promotions are even no purchase required.

225
00:18:26,055 --> 00:18:28,677
[SPEAKER_07]: You can probably just ask for a code and they have to give it to you.

226
00:18:31,494 --> 00:18:35,136
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe, but I'm sure this woman would have not known what the hell I was talking about.

227
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:36,716
[SPEAKER_07]: Should have been like, footlongs are $5!

228
00:18:36,756 --> 00:18:37,377
[SPEAKER_07]: Woo!

229
00:18:38,517 --> 00:18:39,438
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.

230
00:18:39,478 --> 00:18:41,539
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay, footlongs $5, yay.

231
00:18:42,339 --> 00:18:41,539
$5.

232
00:18:42,459 --> 00:18:46,681
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm probably trying to get you really psyched up about the online portion of Uncharted.

233
00:18:46,741 --> 00:18:46,981
[SPEAKER_00]: Uncharted 3

234
00:19:11,755 --> 00:19:12,136
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura.com

235
00:19:30,592 --> 00:19:37,840
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, this is to combat piracy, but really it's just, you know, make a little money on the back end from used copies.

236
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:40,183
[SPEAKER_07]: It's what you call a shameless cash grab.

237
00:19:41,204 --> 00:19:43,066
[SPEAKER_07]: And a way to put the screws to GameStop.

238
00:19:43,446 --> 00:19:46,269
[SPEAKER_07]: And which I'm kind of down with, because fuck GameStop!

239
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:48,812
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I don't have any problem with GameStop, really.

240
00:19:48,852 --> 00:19:49,973
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a problem with GameStop.

241
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:53,811
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, me too.

242
00:19:54,131 --> 00:19:55,572
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, you like movies?

243
00:19:55,932 --> 00:19:56,092
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

244
00:19:56,452 --> 00:19:57,273
[SPEAKER_07]: You like zombies?

245
00:19:57,493 --> 00:19:57,733
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

246
00:19:58,253 --> 00:19:59,594
[SPEAKER_07]: You like movies about zombies?

247
00:19:59,774 --> 00:20:00,054
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

248
00:20:00,194 --> 00:20:01,975
[SPEAKER_07]: You like movies based on video games?

249
00:20:02,515 --> 00:20:02,735
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

250
00:20:04,082 --> 00:20:04,842
[SPEAKER_07]: I like Wild Zero.

251
00:20:33,277 --> 00:20:34,478
[SPEAKER_07]: Good.

252
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:38,021
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.

253
00:20:38,501 --> 00:20:40,883
[SPEAKER_07]: If you like zombie movies, there's more coming.

254
00:20:41,103 --> 00:20:43,945
[SPEAKER_07]: If you like Dead Island, watch the big screen.

255
00:20:45,706 --> 00:20:49,249
[SPEAKER_00]: And, I mean, they're trying to make it an emotional zombie movie.

256
00:20:49,269 --> 00:20:54,753
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're basing it off a trailer, which is great because the trailer had nothing to do with the actual game.

257
00:20:55,233 --> 00:20:57,015
[SPEAKER_07]: Aren't zombie movies always pretty emotional?

258
00:20:58,975 --> 00:21:01,136
[SPEAKER_07]: Zombies are into the pursuit of brains.

259
00:21:01,516 --> 00:21:03,136
[SPEAKER_07]: That's heartfelt right there.

260
00:21:03,836 --> 00:21:04,436
[SPEAKER_07]: They're like, brain.

261
00:21:04,456 --> 00:21:06,317
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel for their play.

262
00:21:06,377 --> 00:21:08,177
[SPEAKER_03]: And people run in fear with great passion.

263
00:21:09,997 --> 00:21:10,418
[SPEAKER_07]: People?

264
00:21:10,678 --> 00:21:11,698
[SPEAKER_07]: There's people in these movies?

265
00:21:12,158 --> 00:21:13,718
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the people that end up being food.

266
00:21:13,798 --> 00:21:15,019
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought people were just food.

267
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:20,020
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know what's kind of annoying, though, is all these zombie movies nowadays, especially starting after, what was it, 28 Days?

268
00:21:22,335 --> 00:21:24,537
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, they all have the smart killer zombies.

269
00:21:24,777 --> 00:21:25,838
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the ones that run.

270
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:30,001
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't have the shuffling undead because the shuffling undead aren't interesting anymore.

271
00:21:30,301 --> 00:21:35,685
[SPEAKER_07]: But the funny thing about zombie movies was it was always just about the fact that they were slow but unstoppable.

272
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:38,227
[SPEAKER_07]: Now they're all fast and unstoppable.

273
00:21:38,608 --> 00:21:40,449
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're fast and unstoppable when they think.

274
00:21:40,729 --> 00:21:42,111
[SPEAKER_07]: Which, you know what that really makes them?

275
00:21:42,531 --> 00:21:44,312
[SPEAKER_07]: Not fucking zombies.

276
00:21:45,673 --> 00:21:46,474
[SPEAKER_07]: Really, guys.

277
00:21:47,174 --> 00:21:51,498
[SPEAKER_03]: I want them to do a zombie movie where the people aren't zombies but all the animals are.

278
00:21:52,332 --> 00:21:53,152
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what would be great?

279
00:21:53,433 --> 00:21:53,793
[SPEAKER_07]: Like zombie cows.

280
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:55,414
[SPEAKER_07]: They did a movie about Resident Evil.

281
00:21:55,954 --> 00:21:59,536
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, kind of like Pet Sematary, yeah, but they're all like church and the people don't come back.

282
00:22:00,316 --> 00:22:01,397
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're attacking all the people.

283
00:22:02,597 --> 00:22:03,217
[SPEAKER_03]: Zombie animals.

284
00:22:03,698 --> 00:22:05,459
[SPEAKER_00]: But would they turn the people into zombies?

285
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:06,599
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they'd just eat them.

286
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,080
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd watch that.

287
00:22:09,441 --> 00:22:10,121
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be a good movie.

288
00:22:10,981 --> 00:22:13,863
[SPEAKER_03]: Copyright, Dark Sakura, 2011, blah, blah, blah, blah.

289
00:22:13,883 --> 00:22:15,364
[SPEAKER_07]: That movie sounds really stupid.

290
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:15,984
[SPEAKER_03]: So do you.

291
00:22:16,604 --> 00:22:17,405
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, next story.

292
00:22:17,565 --> 00:22:18,145
[SPEAKER_07]: You got me there.

293
00:22:18,973 --> 00:22:19,653
[SPEAKER_03]: I love you, mean it.

294
00:22:50,234 --> 00:22:52,995
[SPEAKER_03]: They are being distributed.

295
00:22:53,115 --> 00:22:54,415
[SPEAKER_03]: It's distributed in the U.S.

296
00:22:54,495 --> 00:23:00,697
[SPEAKER_03]: by the same people that do PlayStation, the official magazine, official Xbox magazine, and of course there's Nintendo Power.

297
00:23:01,137 --> 00:23:03,678
[SPEAKER_03]: They do Best Buys at Gamer and PC Gamer.

298
00:23:04,518 --> 00:23:16,181
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're actually saying that since people are, you know, first of all, poor, broke, you can't see the magazine very well at the newsstand.

299
00:23:16,201 --> 00:23:18,262
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's really not getting a big order anymore.

300
00:23:18,802 --> 00:23:21,624
[SPEAKER_03]: And the digital revenues are where the money is.

301
00:23:22,044 --> 00:23:28,248
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, they're thinking about changing how they do Nintendo Power in the U.S.

302
00:23:29,069 --> 00:23:33,391
[SPEAKER_03]: They are thinking about doing it digital only instead of doing it in print.

303
00:23:33,511 --> 00:23:38,274
[SPEAKER_03]: But then again, as someone pointed out earlier in chat, EGM went away and they came back.

304
00:23:42,097 --> 00:23:47,460
[SPEAKER_07]: In my world, when Nintendo quit publishing Nintendo Power, it quit being Nintendo Power.

305
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:50,015
[SPEAKER_07]: It just did.

306
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:52,957
[SPEAKER_07]: It was the end of an era then.

307
00:23:53,117 --> 00:23:56,479
[SPEAKER_07]: Now if it goes away, it's just another magazine going away.

308
00:23:56,819 --> 00:24:00,722
[SPEAKER_07]: But when Nintendo published it, it was the official Nintendo propaganda magazine.

309
00:24:00,742 --> 00:24:02,583
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be like Napster going away now.

310
00:24:02,963 --> 00:24:05,585
[SPEAKER_00]: Who cares?

311
00:24:05,705 --> 00:24:08,587
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, when you said Napster, I'm like, is Napster still around?

312
00:24:08,627 --> 00:24:09,067
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it is.

313
00:24:09,227 --> 00:24:11,068
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a legit music service now.

314
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:13,690
[SPEAKER_00]: No one cared.

315
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:16,572
[SPEAKER_00]: When they're like, we're going legit, everyone's like, we're going elsewhere.

316
00:24:16,592 --> 00:24:16,672
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

317
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:17,751
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

318
00:24:18,171 --> 00:24:20,253
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, wait a minute, I can't steal music for free?

319
00:24:20,653 --> 00:24:21,514
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck this.

320
00:24:21,974 --> 00:24:22,535
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm out.

321
00:24:23,055 --> 00:24:35,566
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, according to Gamasutra, Future is going to be doing their update for their plan starting on, I believe, they're going to show what the plan is for November 24th and later through 2012.

322
00:24:37,067 --> 00:24:37,648
[SPEAKER_03]: If anyone cares.

323
00:24:38,629 --> 00:24:39,390
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people care.

324
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:40,030
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn it.

325
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:40,891
[SPEAKER_03]: I care.

326
00:24:41,071 --> 00:24:41,391
[SPEAKER_03]: A little.

327
00:24:44,014 --> 00:24:44,294
[SPEAKER_02]: Next.

328
00:24:44,892 --> 00:24:45,253
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, cool.

329
00:24:45,273 --> 00:24:50,480
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk a little bit about what's coming out soon, starting with October in the US.

330
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:50,721
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wait.

331
00:24:50,781 --> 00:24:51,722
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't this hard music?

332
00:24:52,463 --> 00:24:54,206
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we don't have music for this section.

333
00:24:54,386 --> 00:24:55,648
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I did it anyway.

334
00:24:55,888 --> 00:24:56,890
[SPEAKER_00]: We have music.

335
00:24:57,751 --> 00:24:58,632
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so what's coming out?

336
00:24:58,652 --> 00:24:59,794
[SPEAKER_00]: I refuse to have music.

337
00:25:00,094 --> 00:25:00,395
[SPEAKER_03]: Fine.

338
00:25:03,291 --> 00:25:09,374
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways, today actually Tetris Axis came out on Nintendo 3DS and it was great.

339
00:25:09,874 --> 00:25:20,279
[SPEAKER_00]: Earlier this week Kotaku had actually run a little bit of they do this stupid video blogging crap for some of the games that they get to test and stuff like, oh look, we got the test!

340
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:26,781
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were showing off the augmented reality portions of Tetris Axis and man, that looks retarded.

341
00:25:27,822 --> 00:25:32,784
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so glad that I'm not a big Tetris fan because it's just like, hey look, I put

342
00:25:33,004 --> 00:25:34,885
[SPEAKER_00]: Dark Souls on PS3 and Xbox 360 Sometimes you're clever

343
00:26:02,399 --> 00:26:13,371
[SPEAKER_00]: Gunslingers coming out on the Wii and this is kind of an on-rails western shooter game NBA 2K12 coming out on PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii and PSP

344
00:26:17,795 --> 00:26:47,132
[SPEAKER_00]: Rage coming out on PS3, Xbox 360, and PC Age of Enigma, The Secret of the Sixth Ghost on PC No idea what that is Spider-Man Edge of Time on PS3, Xbox 360, Wii, 3DS, and NDS Hopefully it's not as terrible as X-Men Destiny because that game has gotten some pretty terrible reviews That game got murdered in the reviews

345
00:26:47,813 --> 00:26:51,314
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really nice that you put this unfinished game out.

346
00:26:51,615 --> 00:26:53,115
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what's sad about that game too?

347
00:26:53,615 --> 00:27:01,439
[SPEAKER_07]: It's made by Silicon Knights who at one time was a really decent publisher and now they're just bootsy.

348
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:07,441
[SPEAKER_00]: Girls Only coming out on Nintendo DS.

349
00:27:08,441 --> 00:27:09,522
[SPEAKER_00]: It is for girls only.

350
00:27:10,662 --> 00:27:14,784
[SPEAKER_00]: They will shoot you on sight if you try to buy that and you're not a girl.

351
00:27:14,984 --> 00:27:16,905
[SPEAKER_02]: I was hoping it would be like Boobalicious or something.

352
00:27:17,989 --> 00:27:19,192
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's not that good.

353
00:27:19,252 --> 00:27:19,813
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.

354
00:27:19,873 --> 00:27:24,405
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just some crappy girl-targeted game.

355
00:27:24,866 --> 00:27:25,948
[SPEAKER_03]: How to knit and shop.

356
00:27:31,457 --> 00:27:48,489
[SPEAKER_00]: Face Raiders Photo Finish 3DS It's an awesome kart racing game where you can take a picture and put your face on the kart or the person driving the kart because everybody really wants to do that in a stupid kart racing game You know you can do that on the arcade version of Mario Kart?

357
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:56,575
[SPEAKER_00]: Completely unaware of that I'm so unaware of that I'm glad I have no memory of doing that at my bachelor party

358
00:27:56,875 --> 00:27:57,255
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, good.

359
00:28:01,199 --> 00:28:01,999
[SPEAKER_00]: That wasn't your face.

360
00:28:03,601 --> 00:28:07,564
[SPEAKER_00]: Sid Meier's Civilization V Game of the Year Edition on PC.

361
00:28:07,904 --> 00:28:09,826
[SPEAKER_00]: And they made me drive as Luigi.

362
00:28:10,066 --> 00:28:11,727
[SPEAKER_00]: That is just a crime right there.

363
00:28:12,348 --> 00:28:13,068
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was Luigi.

364
00:28:13,969 --> 00:28:15,390
[SPEAKER_07]: I was so messed up.

365
00:28:16,431 --> 00:28:18,532
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no memory of it until I saw the video.

[SPEAKER_07]: Payday the High, Sega Bass Fishing Space Channel 5 Part 2 all that crap comes out on the 5th it's like really?

375
00:29:31,419 --> 00:29:32,600
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually next week, I believe.

376
00:29:34,902 --> 00:29:39,425
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I played it on PC and it was pretty fun up until the end where the game decided, hey, you know what?

[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to do it.

379
00:29:41,926 --> 00:29:44,848
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm interested to see it from a technological standpoint.

380
00:29:45,308 --> 00:29:48,911
[SPEAKER_07]: Crysis, you know, was a real system killer.

381
00:29:49,651 --> 00:29:52,293
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was a really unoptimized piece of shit.

382
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:58,757
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't wait to see if they've managed to make it run well on the 360 and PS3, or if it's going to run like Crysis.

383
00:29:59,058 --> 00:30:00,118
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they did with Warhead.

384
00:30:00,138 --> 00:30:02,320
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, they totally revamped the whole engine.

385
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:05,422
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, oh, hey, yeah, by the way, remember that game that killed all your PCs?

386
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:09,345
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we finally got around to optimizing that, and now I can run in pretty much everything.

387
00:30:09,738 --> 00:30:10,378
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's what I'm saying.

388
00:30:10,398 --> 00:30:15,600
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to see if it will run on the 360 and whatnot.

389
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:20,822
[SPEAKER_07]: My understanding is that happens a lot, and I'll ask you about this later, but I was talking to someone about GTA for the PC.

390
00:30:20,942 --> 00:30:21,302
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.

391
00:30:21,422 --> 00:30:24,263
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a terrible, very unoptimized.

392
00:30:24,323 --> 00:30:28,525
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, oh, it takes such a PC to run it.

393
00:30:28,565 --> 00:30:33,647
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you see the link that I posted to the Vice City mod that somebody did?

394
00:30:33,707 --> 00:30:35,727
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think I've seen those mods before.

395
00:30:35,767 --> 00:30:36,868
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got to play that.

396
00:30:37,808 --> 00:30:38,770
[SPEAKER_07]: It's gonna be so good.

397
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:42,959
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyways, so there's the releases for the UK.

398
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:45,545

00:32:52,604 --> 00:32:54,345

[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably just sometime in October.

427
00:32:59,607 --> 00:33:01,008
[SPEAKER_00]: I doubt that they're getting it that early.

428
00:33:01,328 --> 00:33:04,230
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but it gives our friends overseas something to look forward to.

429
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:08,031
[SPEAKER_00]: Something you can look forward to, but when you go to the store this week, you're not going to find it there.

430
00:33:09,832 --> 00:33:11,013
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't say it was this week.

431
00:33:11,033 --> 00:33:11,853
[SPEAKER_03]: I said it was this month.

432
00:33:11,873 --> 00:33:13,074
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

433
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:16,100
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of strange.

434
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:20,745
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got this game coming out for iOS called Life of George.

435
00:33:20,885 --> 00:33:26,431
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you might be thinking, is this like some sort of documentary game based on George Washington?

436
00:33:26,451 --> 00:33:27,031
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

437
00:33:27,431 --> 00:33:31,435
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a Lego game, actually, where you're challenged to build...

438
00:33:32,256 --> 00:33:38,540
[SPEAKER_00]: Different things that you see in this photo album using actual bricks.

439
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:41,602
[SPEAKER_00]: You buy a $30 kit from the Lego store.

440
00:33:42,102 --> 00:33:44,404
[SPEAKER_00]: You've already kind of lost me there because it's a $30 kit.

441
00:33:44,844 --> 00:33:46,545
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm assuming it comes with like 10 pieces.

442
00:33:48,847 --> 00:33:49,927
[SPEAKER_00]: And you apparently...

443
00:33:52,142 --> 00:33:52,762
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching!

444
00:34:12,105 --> 00:34:35,811
[SPEAKER_00]: Really a $30 iOS game, and I mean, and I have not actually seen what this LEGO kit is, but I'm going to be willing to bet that it's probably, considering the price of LEGOs, which is really ridiculous, it's probably like 20 pieces, so it wouldn't be that difficult to recreate everything.

445
00:34:36,531 --> 00:34:38,451
[SPEAKER_00]: But just out of curiosity, let's see.

446
00:34:38,912 --> 00:34:40,192
[SPEAKER_00]: Life of George.

447
00:34:40,952 --> 00:34:43,073
[SPEAKER_07]: That actually does sound kind of cool.

448
00:34:43,814 --> 00:34:44,934
[SPEAKER_07]: Because you're a Lego addict.

449
00:34:45,054 --> 00:34:48,076
[SPEAKER_07]: And at the same time, devastatingly stupid.

450
00:34:48,896 --> 00:34:50,717
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoa, I am surprised.

451
00:34:50,837 --> 00:34:52,578
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually 146 pieces.

452
00:34:52,758 --> 00:34:56,220
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually not bad for Legos.

453
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,261
[SPEAKER_07]: But from that picture, they're like really basic pieces.

454
00:34:59,582 --> 00:35:01,342
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, I'd imagine.

455
00:35:02,863 --> 00:35:06,285
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I would probably just play with the Legos separately anyway and not care.

456
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:09,071
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I just go buy Legos.

457
00:35:09,151 --> 00:35:11,893
[SPEAKER_00]: That game better be free once you buy that stupid kit.

458
00:35:11,993 --> 00:35:12,894
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I gotta say.

459
00:35:13,895 --> 00:35:14,595
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's $44.99.

460
00:35:17,157 --> 00:35:20,020
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds to me like, was it TomTom or whatever like that?

461
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,261
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, hey, you gotta buy this GPS thing, $70.

462
00:35:23,122 --> 00:35:25,124
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, did we mention the software's in there, $40.

463
00:35:25,844 --> 00:35:27,205
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we hate you.

464
00:35:27,946 --> 00:35:31,349
[SPEAKER_03]: We want your money and you are gullible, so give it to us.

465
00:35:32,249 --> 00:35:32,950
[SPEAKER_03]: How's that, like that?

466
00:35:34,211 --> 00:35:34,351
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

467
00:35:34,807 --> 00:35:35,768
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

468
00:35:55,667 --> 00:36:04,836
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's apparently super popular, but it's not getting a fall update, but it's not going away.

469
00:36:04,876 --> 00:36:09,320
[SPEAKER_03]: They just said that they plan to refresh the Texas heat season in the future.

470
00:36:09,661 --> 00:36:10,782
[SPEAKER_03]: So what does that mean?

471
00:36:11,963 --> 00:36:14,505
[SPEAKER_03]: That means that, oh, we're not going to change anything.

472
00:36:14,525 --> 00:36:16,327
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just going to say, oh, new tournament start.

473
00:36:16,387 --> 00:36:16,988
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the same thing.

474
00:36:19,585 --> 00:36:20,226
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

475
00:36:40,285 --> 00:36:54,598
[SPEAKER_00]: This, I can see, you know, being able to play a lot more without actual structure in a season versus 1 vs. 100, which is more of like a trivia game that's kind of, you know, host-driven and it'd be a little difficult.

476
00:36:54,738 --> 00:36:58,441
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I can see how they're able to carry it on beyond, you know, like a season.

477
00:36:59,522 --> 00:37:05,127
[SPEAKER_07]: Even the 1 vs. 100 extended play, though, just the practice rounds were fun just to pop on there and play.

478
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,981
[SPEAKER_00]: I never played them, and I'm disappointed.

479
00:37:09,241 --> 00:37:14,904
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually very disappointed that Bob Saget was not the host on the online version.

480
00:37:15,205 --> 00:37:17,046
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Bob Saget's a gangster.

481
00:37:17,886 --> 00:37:18,466
[SPEAKER_03]: He's so cool.

482
00:37:20,067 --> 00:37:26,151
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, actually there's been one poker game that's come out that I like, and that's Poker Night at the Inventory.

483
00:37:26,711 --> 00:37:28,512
[SPEAKER_07]: I still have got to download that.

484
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,621
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I watched Jamie play.

485
00:37:31,641 --> 00:37:32,661
[SPEAKER_07]: See, I don't want to pay $4 for it, though.

486
00:37:32,701 --> 00:37:33,142
[SPEAKER_07]: You paid $4 for it.

487
00:37:33,162 --> 00:37:34,462
[SPEAKER_07]: You can play it on my computer.

488
00:37:34,863 --> 00:37:35,663
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't like your computer.

489
00:37:35,683 --> 00:37:35,983
[SPEAKER_03]: Cheapo.

490
00:37:36,363 --> 00:37:38,985
[SPEAKER_03]: Then put a copy of my account on your computer.

491
00:37:39,225 --> 00:37:40,526
[SPEAKER_07]: See, that's what I'm talking about.

492
00:37:40,546 --> 00:37:40,526
$4.

493
00:37:42,387 --> 00:37:43,687
[SPEAKER_07]: You're so Dutch.

494
00:37:43,707 --> 00:37:44,808
[SPEAKER_07]: Do I look like I'm made of money?

495
00:37:45,268 --> 00:37:46,029
[SPEAKER_03]: You're so Dutch.

496
00:37:46,069 --> 00:37:46,809
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever, Jew.

497
00:37:47,549 --> 00:37:47,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Dutch.

498
00:37:50,331 --> 00:37:51,171
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so anyway.

499
00:37:53,499 --> 00:38:03,401
[SPEAKER_03]: How about you talk about something that actually matters to people instead of just throwing out religious and ancestry-related comments?

500
00:38:04,241 --> 00:38:05,962
[SPEAKER_07]: What in the crap are you talking about?

501
00:38:06,482 --> 00:38:07,782
[SPEAKER_03]: Classic Game, duh.

502
00:38:08,722 --> 00:38:09,723
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Classic Game.

503
00:38:10,243 --> 00:38:11,663
[SPEAKER_03]: This isn't music for Classic Game.

504
00:38:12,663 --> 00:38:14,904
[SPEAKER_07]: This music is entirely too happy for Classic Game.

505
00:38:17,674 --> 00:38:18,495
[SPEAKER_03]: Start talking about it.

506
00:38:18,795 --> 00:38:20,496
[SPEAKER_07]: Is this really the music for classic games?

507
00:38:20,516 --> 00:38:21,877
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the intro music, dumbass.

508
00:38:21,917 --> 00:38:27,041
[SPEAKER_07]: I need something cool like the black hole music from one of the Advance Wars games.

509
00:38:27,061 --> 00:38:28,042
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be amazing.

510
00:38:29,003 --> 00:38:32,926
[SPEAKER_07]: How about this?

511
00:38:33,126 --> 00:38:33,987
[SPEAKER_07]: Pause that for a second.

512
00:38:34,266 --> 00:38:35,086
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got to play it in the background.

513
00:38:36,027 --> 00:38:40,489
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, before we get into this whole classic game of the week thing, I want to just throw this out there.

514
00:38:40,809 --> 00:38:45,131
[SPEAKER_07]: The whole reason Jamie's been doing this thing for years is because it was stolen from me.

515
00:38:45,651 --> 00:38:47,532
[SPEAKER_07]: I know everything about classic games.

516
00:38:47,572 --> 00:38:50,314
[SPEAKER_07]: La, la, la, la, la, la.

517
00:38:50,374 --> 00:38:50,854
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you're not.

518
00:38:51,334 --> 00:38:52,415
[SPEAKER_03]: I know everything about classic games.

519
00:38:52,475 --> 00:38:52,975
[SPEAKER_07]: I am the boss.

520
00:38:53,115 --> 00:38:54,576
[SPEAKER_07]: And everybody knows this, right?

521
00:38:55,456 --> 00:38:56,659
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm the master of the vault.

522
00:38:57,039 --> 00:38:59,103
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm the one who keeps and maintains the collection.

523
00:38:59,724 --> 00:39:03,511
[SPEAKER_07]: When Jamie comes to give you guys classic games, you know who she asks for them?

524
00:39:04,052 --> 00:39:04,313
[SPEAKER_07]: Me.

525
00:39:05,034 --> 00:39:07,679
[SPEAKER_07]: So anyways, if you like Classic Game of the Week, thank you.

526
00:39:09,068 --> 00:39:10,309
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate your work.

527
00:39:10,529 --> 00:39:14,170
[SPEAKER_07]: And I appreciate Jamie's work in bringing you so many classic games.

528
00:39:14,210 --> 00:39:15,310
[SPEAKER_03]: Dan's not getting laid tonight.

529
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:16,351
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever.

530
00:39:16,571 --> 00:39:17,491
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to get laid anyway.

531
00:39:17,771 --> 00:39:21,072
[SPEAKER_07]: You can flip me the bird for like an hour if you really, really want to.

532
00:39:21,512 --> 00:39:23,273
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyways, okay.

533
00:39:23,813 --> 00:39:24,873
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I play the music again?

534
00:39:24,954 --> 00:39:25,614
[SPEAKER_07]: Start the music.

535
00:39:25,754 --> 00:39:26,114
[SPEAKER_07]: Shut up.

536
00:39:29,682 --> 00:39:30,663
[SPEAKER_07]: Tell them about the damn game.

537
00:39:47,202 --> 00:39:47,702
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

538
00:40:06,272 --> 00:40:06,973
[SPEAKER_07]: and DarkSakura.

539
00:40:29,875 --> 00:40:36,537
[SPEAKER_07]: The basic idea is that this giant computer, get this, you'll never have seen this coming, has taken over the galaxy.

540
00:40:36,777 --> 00:40:37,277
[SPEAKER_07]: Who knows?

541
00:40:37,697 --> 00:40:38,337
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I know.

542
00:40:38,918 --> 00:40:42,759
[SPEAKER_07]: And the irony is that humanity created the giant computer.

543
00:40:42,839 --> 00:40:44,739
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you haven't beaten the game, sorry about that.

544
00:40:44,759 --> 00:40:45,880
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a big spoiler.

545
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:53,922
[SPEAKER_07]: And so they dispatch you to go in there with your ship, one ship, and annihilate like jillions of enemies and wipe them all out.

546
00:40:54,827 --> 00:41:02,212
[SPEAKER_07]: The levels scroll every which way, the backgrounds move, you face ships that make the giant ship in R-Type look like a tinker toy.

547
00:41:02,272 --> 00:41:02,813
[SPEAKER_02]: Giant flowers.

548
00:41:04,094 --> 00:41:06,075
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah, you shoot some giant flowers too.

549
00:41:06,435 --> 00:41:07,396
[SPEAKER_07]: Robot fish.

550
00:41:08,517 --> 00:41:09,797
[SPEAKER_07]: Just, it's awesome.

551
00:41:09,978 --> 00:41:12,219
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really hard to describe how great this game is.

552
00:41:12,459 --> 00:41:18,964
[SPEAKER_07]: If you can throw down an emulator or if you have a Sega Genesis, like I'm sure some of you do, you really need to play this game.

553
00:41:20,970 --> 00:41:21,971
[SPEAKER_07]: What else should I say about it?

554
00:41:21,991 --> 00:41:23,732
[SPEAKER_03]: What else should I say about it?

555
00:41:45,031 --> 00:41:48,614
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember you trying to play this on the Nomad and yelling at it.

556
00:42:08,012 --> 00:42:08,613
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

557
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:29,282
[SPEAKER_07]: And when you die, you lose the weapon that you collected.

558
00:42:29,742 --> 00:42:33,304
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's not as big a disaster as it is in, like, Gradius when you die.

559
00:42:33,504 --> 00:42:34,945
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, you don't start from zero.

560
00:42:35,365 --> 00:42:44,771
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you really like the hunter or wave weapons and you get hit and lose them, then you have to, you know, soldier through without them until you get another wave weapon.

561
00:42:45,171 --> 00:42:46,212
[SPEAKER_03]: This level pisses me off.

562
00:42:46,232 --> 00:42:49,394
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys should be able to see this because this level is totally sweet.

563
00:42:49,798 --> 00:42:55,602
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, how about if someone reminds me, I will repost it to our Tumblr.

564
00:42:55,862 --> 00:42:56,222
[SPEAKER_03]: Your thing.

565
00:42:56,242 --> 00:42:57,023
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll put it on our Tumblr.

566
00:42:57,203 --> 00:42:57,863
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll tumble it.

567
00:42:58,063 --> 00:42:58,423
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll tumble.

568
00:42:58,443 --> 00:43:10,591
[SPEAKER_07]: Like they're flying through the first level of Castlevania X. Yeah, except for like this game came out like four years before Castlevania Dracula XX, the Rondo of Blood.

569
00:43:12,066 --> 00:43:14,747
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty cool though, but yeah, I completely suck at this game.

570
00:43:14,807 --> 00:43:15,287
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll admit it.

571
00:43:15,587 --> 00:43:15,887
[SPEAKER_03]: I've tried.

572
00:43:16,107 --> 00:43:17,528
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really not that hard.

573
00:43:17,548 --> 00:43:19,949
[SPEAKER_07]: There's way, way more difficult cheaters.

574
00:43:20,669 --> 00:43:24,090
[SPEAKER_07]: I can definitely one-credit it, if not one-life it.

575
00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:27,251
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think our type is harder.

576
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:30,960
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, our type is blisteringly difficult compared to Thunder Force.

577
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:37,101
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, the first time you play Thunder Force 3, you think, oh, it's fast and difficult, but the weapons are awesome.

578
00:43:37,141 --> 00:43:40,842
[SPEAKER_07]: When you get a powered-up ship, if you're not really lame, you know, it's hard to die.

579
00:43:41,003 --> 00:43:43,103
[SPEAKER_07]: Our type, it's just really easy to die.

580
00:43:43,643 --> 00:43:43,883
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

581
00:43:44,223 --> 00:43:46,304
[SPEAKER_07]: The difference is our type is like a thinking man shooter.

582
00:43:46,364 --> 00:43:51,725
[SPEAKER_07]: It's slow, and it's all about positioning the ship and, you know, handling the obstacles correctly.

583
00:43:52,045 --> 00:43:54,006
[SPEAKER_07]: Thunder Force is much more of a twitch shooter.

584
00:43:54,497 --> 00:43:55,458
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I see that.

585
00:43:55,578 --> 00:44:00,544
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well, how about some boss music before we go to break?

586
00:44:00,965 --> 00:44:01,426
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't care.

587
00:44:01,626 --> 00:44:02,267
[SPEAKER_07]: Play whatever you want.

588
00:44:04,449 --> 00:44:05,831
[SPEAKER_03]: Shoot, shoot, bang, bang.

589
00:44:06,031 --> 00:44:07,473
[SPEAKER_03]: Pew, pew, pew, pew.

590
00:44:07,533 --> 00:44:07,853
[SPEAKER_03]: Lasers.

591
00:44:09,996 --> 00:44:12,779
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is our classic game of the week.

592
00:44:12,919 --> 00:44:13,961
[SPEAKER_07]: My classic game of the week.

593
00:44:14,451 --> 00:44:39,703
[SPEAKER_03]: Thunder Force 3 on Genesis slash Mega Drive slash Genesis it was on the Genesis and the SNES and the Arcade and you could also play it on the Saturn yeah all that too alright well guess what that's the end of part A and I'm going to do the ritual saving of part A now so stay tuned I will keep you occupied with Mega Man music this is the part where we sacrifice a goat

594
00:44:40,825 --> 00:44:41,206
[SPEAKER_03]: No!

595
00:44:41,426 --> 00:44:43,329
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, as long as we get to make some curry out of it later.

596
00:44:43,770 --> 00:44:44,551
[SPEAKER_03]: Take that, goat!

597
00:44:45,393 --> 00:44:48,498
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, everyone, stay tuned.

598
00:44:55,159 --> 00:44:57,120
[SPEAKER_03]: And we are back from our break.

599
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:58,420
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for sticking with us.

600
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:00,981
[SPEAKER_03]: This is, of course, Orange Lounge Radio.

601
00:45:01,801 --> 00:45:06,443
[SPEAKER_03]: And as I said before at the beginning of Part A, Rob is gone.

602
00:45:06,783 --> 00:45:07,583
[SPEAKER_03]: He's at Disneyland.

603
00:45:07,763 --> 00:45:10,824
[SPEAKER_03]: We locked him in the firehouse in Walt's bedroom.

604
00:45:11,364 --> 00:45:12,225
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've taken over.

605
00:45:12,585 --> 00:45:18,927
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is me tonight, DarkSakura, Loki, and that dude that I picked up on the internet, Dan.

606
00:45:19,087 --> 00:45:20,747
[SPEAKER_07]: The notorious D-A-N.

607
00:45:22,508 --> 00:45:23,028
[SPEAKER_07]: What what?

608
00:45:24,076 --> 00:45:24,396
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

609
00:45:24,837 --> 00:45:25,097
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

610
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:28,079
[SPEAKER_03]: Hearts.

611
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:28,820
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

612
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:29,440
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi.

613
00:45:29,901 --> 00:45:30,581
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's Dan.

614
00:45:30,621 --> 00:45:31,102
[SPEAKER_03]: I married him.

615
00:45:31,122 --> 00:45:31,802
[SPEAKER_03]: I get to live with that.

616
00:45:32,743 --> 00:45:33,183
[SPEAKER_03]: I love you.

617
00:45:34,044 --> 00:45:34,284
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

618
00:45:34,304 --> 00:45:34,685
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, sure.

619
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:35,665
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, sure.

620
00:45:36,166 --> 00:45:38,828
[SPEAKER_03]: So how about we just go ahead and get into Rapid Fire News?

621

625
00:47:10,612 --> 00:47:14,735
[SPEAKER_00]: I might actually have to check that out, I mean, with all the songs that they're putting in there.

626
00:47:14,915 --> 00:47:17,077
[SPEAKER_07]: It's amazing, considering it's from Japan.

627
00:47:17,737 --> 00:47:19,478
[SPEAKER_02]: But they don't always get licenses.

628
00:47:19,918 --> 00:47:25,803
[SPEAKER_00]: These games, they're coming out, they usually tend to put a lot of licensed stuff and weird old shit.

629
00:47:27,844 --> 00:47:28,745
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's very surprising.

630
00:47:29,985 --> 00:47:31,827
[SPEAKER_07]: Also... Does it have Boom Boom Dollar?

631
00:47:33,008 --> 00:47:34,869
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, I haven't looked at the other ones.

632
00:47:35,069 --> 00:47:36,330
[SPEAKER_07]: If it doesn't, then fuck it.

633
00:47:38,303 --> 00:47:41,886
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, of course, also, Dance Dance Revolution X2 Max.

634
00:47:42,126 --> 00:47:46,330
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got the unlocked code, which is unintentionally released, apparently.

635
00:47:47,888 --> 00:47:48,469
[SPEAKER_00]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft

636
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:38,488
[SPEAKER_00]: Dazzlin' Darlin', the AKBK mix, remixed by DJ Command, also from Dance Dance Revolution 2 there If You Were Here, the LEDG style remix by Jennifer Kimono Princess by Jun Looks like Roppongi Evolved by Tag Underground Antimatter by Orbit1 and Milo

638
00:49:04,304 --> 00:49:08,267
[SPEAKER_07]: Something called Valkyrie Dimension by Spriggan actually just sounds kind of cool.

639
00:49:09,974 --> 00:49:11,455
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to say, what, no dropout?

640
00:49:11,515 --> 00:49:15,216
[SPEAKER_07]: But now I'm just wanting to see what Valkyrie Dimension by Spriggan is.

641
00:49:16,717 --> 00:49:17,517
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, lots of cool songs.

642
00:49:17,877 --> 00:49:23,160
[SPEAKER_00]: And, of course, based on the last list we just read there, a lot of these are going to be featured in Dance Dance Revolution, too.

643
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:26,061
[SPEAKER_00]: So it might be worth checking out.

644
00:49:26,241 --> 00:49:28,062
[SPEAKER_00]: And, I mean, let's just put it this way.

645
00:49:28,162 --> 00:49:32,643
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't check it out right away, I can guarantee that the game will probably price drop pretty quick anyways.

646
00:49:32,784 --> 00:49:35,185
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's actually not that expensive going into it.

647
00:49:35,545 --> 00:49:35,725
[SPEAKER_00]: So...

648
00:49:36,565 --> 00:49:38,447
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it might not hurt to check it out.

649
00:49:38,868 --> 00:49:44,394
[SPEAKER_00]: After all these bundles nowadays on the Wii, like the same price as a PlayStation 2 DDR game back in the day.

650
00:49:44,474 --> 00:49:49,780
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, 50 bucks will get you a dance pad for the Wii and the game.

651
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:54,745
[SPEAKER_03]: Zether pointed out that Soda Fujimori also did an awesome Gradius Trance mix.

652
00:49:56,327 --> 00:49:56,487
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

653
00:49:57,188 --> 00:49:59,550
[SPEAKER_03]: Step Up Evolution's Kyle Ward and Chris Foy

654
00:50:20,068 --> 00:50:22,809
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it is now heading to the arcades.

655
00:50:23,329 --> 00:50:33,272
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, in fact, the original design, and you can actually see this in the YouTube video that they first put up, um, actually did call for some sort of, like, dance mat control type thing.

656
00:50:34,152 --> 00:50:46,376
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, not sure if that's actually gonna be included with it, but it's gonna include a 42-inch multiplayer touchscreen, um, with a global interactive, uh, ranking network, according to the press release.

657
00:50:47,056 --> 00:50:47,556
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um,

658
00:50:48,939 --> 00:50:54,122
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be interesting to see if that actually is going to include the dance pad or whatever stage.

659
00:50:55,123 --> 00:50:57,044
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is coming to arcades rather soon.

660
00:50:57,224 --> 00:51:07,930
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, Song Pack 15 is out on iOS, including Pegasus by When Machines Dream and also Rock Robotic by When Dreams Machine.

661
00:51:08,451 --> 00:51:09,592
[SPEAKER_00]: Or When Machines Dream.

662
00:51:09,952 --> 00:51:10,792
[SPEAKER_00]: When Dreams Machine.

663
00:51:12,974 --> 00:51:13,774
[SPEAKER_00]: But those are coming out.

664
00:51:13,894 --> 00:51:15,935
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, you can get those right now on the iOS.

665
00:51:15,995 --> 00:51:17,116
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, 15 song packs.

666
00:51:17,536 --> 00:51:19,337
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just ridiculous.

667
00:51:19,377 --> 00:51:24,981
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot more than Konami ever did on any of their Dance Dance Revolution mixes recently.

668
00:51:27,242 --> 00:51:27,542
[SPEAKER_02]: Alas.

669
00:51:28,623 --> 00:51:28,803
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

670
00:51:29,423 --> 00:51:31,364
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, how about something that has nothing to do with DDR?

671
00:51:32,205 --> 00:51:37,348
[SPEAKER_07]: So, remember back in 2008, Ubisoft announced that they were going to make a game called I Am Alive.

672
00:51:38,049 --> 00:51:38,590
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

673
00:51:54,062 --> 00:51:55,463
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that game isn't dead.

674
00:51:55,983 --> 00:51:58,444
[SPEAKER_07]: They're actually just about to release it.

675
00:51:58,484 --> 00:51:59,764
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to come out this winter.

676
00:52:00,404 --> 00:52:00,664
[SPEAKER_07]: Really?

677
00:52:01,365 --> 00:52:01,725
[SPEAKER_07]: Really.

678
00:52:02,245 --> 00:52:03,045
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, you don't say.

679
00:52:03,425 --> 00:52:05,426
[SPEAKER_07]: I was amazed when I saw the story.

680
00:52:05,506 --> 00:52:06,646
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, really?

681
00:52:07,107 --> 00:52:09,067
[SPEAKER_07]: Isn't this like three or four years old?

682
00:52:09,347 --> 00:52:12,208
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought that it was, for some reason I remember that being like a PS1 game.

683
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:13,609
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not even that old.

684
00:52:13,629 --> 00:52:15,710
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was probably a couple years ago.

685
00:52:15,810 --> 00:52:15,990
[SPEAKER_00]: It was 2008.

686
00:52:16,050 --> 00:52:16,330
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?

687
00:52:16,350 --> 00:52:16,570
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought.

688
00:52:19,972 --> 00:52:27,381
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it was 09 because I thought that originally it was supposed to be coming out in March and then it got pushed back again.

689
00:52:28,603 --> 00:52:30,365
[SPEAKER_00]: But maybe that's March of last year.

690
00:52:30,385 --> 00:52:36,774
[SPEAKER_07]: I just remember that every time they started talking about that game, there was some sort of catastrophe in the world and they were like, oh...

691
00:52:37,114 --> 00:52:37,874
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

692
00:52:53,021 --> 00:52:55,462
[SPEAKER_07]: and just, it's been backburnered this whole time.

693
00:52:55,602 --> 00:53:04,766
[SPEAKER_07]: So, if you really want to play like a three and a half year old survival horror game, because you know how great that's going to be, watch for it to be hitting shelves before Christmas.

694
00:53:05,167 --> 00:53:07,608
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, not shelves at all.

695
00:53:08,108 --> 00:53:08,908
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, is it a download?

696
00:53:09,088 --> 00:53:10,069
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a downloadable game.

697
00:53:10,089 --> 00:53:12,370
[SPEAKER_07]: Download it off the internet before Christmas.

698
00:53:12,390 --> 00:53:17,012
[SPEAKER_00]: But see, that's great though, because it's not going to be like, you know, 50 bucks or 30 bucks.

699
00:53:17,072 --> 00:53:17,612
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be 15.

700
00:53:18,053 --> 00:53:19,593
[SPEAKER_00]: I can deal with 15.

701
00:53:19,633 --> 00:53:19,653
[SPEAKER_00]: I...

702
00:53:21,877 --> 00:53:22,177
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

703
00:53:22,938 --> 00:53:24,259
[SPEAKER_07]: They should just give it away at this point.

704
00:53:24,479 --> 00:53:24,719
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?

705
00:53:24,759 --> 00:53:25,639
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I agree.

706
00:53:25,679 --> 00:53:26,520
[SPEAKER_00]: Free would be perfect.

707
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:29,221
[SPEAKER_07]: They'd probably sell a few copies.

708
00:53:30,982 --> 00:53:31,782
[SPEAKER_07]: It might be awesome.

709
00:53:31,882 --> 00:53:33,743
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I'll reserve judgment on this awesomeness.

710
00:53:33,763 --> 00:53:35,204
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what they need to do because it's Ubisoft?

711
00:53:36,025 --> 00:53:37,465
[SPEAKER_00]: The cause of the disaster was the Rabbids.

712
00:53:37,485 --> 00:53:38,386
[SPEAKER_07]: Release Beyond Good and Evil 2?

713
00:53:48,068 --> 00:54:07,692
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that was actually supposed to be a series that was like a primetime like comedy series with the Rabbids but they haven't done it yet they're kind of you know a one joke character who cares there's a lot of one joke characters that still have like movie after movie after movie

714
00:54:09,415 --> 00:54:09,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah?

715
00:54:10,636 --> 00:54:18,439
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, if you're talking about, like, well, let's see, any of the dog movies that they have, like, was it Beethoven that they made?

716
00:54:18,459 --> 00:54:21,541
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's true, because they keep making fucking penguin movies.

717
00:54:22,141 --> 00:54:23,021
[SPEAKER_00]: Penguins, yes.

718
00:54:23,181 --> 00:54:24,722
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, oh, dear God.

719
00:54:24,922 --> 00:54:27,543
[SPEAKER_07]: Disclaimer, this was supposed to be rapid-fire news, everybody.

720
00:54:27,703 --> 00:54:27,923
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

721
00:54:29,464 --> 00:54:29,904
[SPEAKER_07]: Shut up.

722
00:54:30,425 --> 00:54:31,585
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, you shut up.

723
00:54:31,725 --> 00:54:32,506
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm the boss tonight.

724
00:54:32,786 --> 00:54:33,126
[SPEAKER_07]: No, you're not.

725
00:54:33,326 --> 00:54:36,688
[SPEAKER_07]: To rapid fire on to the next news story.

726
00:54:36,728 --> 00:54:37,049
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

727
00:54:37,349 --> 00:54:38,349
[SPEAKER_07]: You like rock band?

728
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:39,770
[SPEAKER_07]: You like Limp Bizkit?

729
00:54:40,391 --> 00:54:42,092
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, nobody likes Limp Bizkit.

730
00:54:42,532 --> 00:54:51,497
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, if you want to spend $10, you can get, I guess $7 if you want to do it as a package, you can get four Limp Bizkit songs in your rock band.

731
00:54:51,837 --> 00:54:56,040
[SPEAKER_07]: Gold Cobra, Nookie, My Way, and Rearranged.

732
00:54:56,380 --> 00:55:00,931
[SPEAKER_07]: Plus, they're going to get you for an extra buck if you want pro guitar or bass.

733
00:55:01,993 --> 00:55:03,096
[SPEAKER_07]: Goody, goody gumdrops.

734
00:55:05,619 --> 00:55:10,685
[SPEAKER_07]: In some actually valuable news, the PS3 plays Blu-rays, plays games.

735
00:55:11,646 --> 00:55:12,166
[SPEAKER_07]: It's okay.

736
00:55:12,487 --> 00:55:17,051
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, it's going to validate its existence because now you can get Chrono Trigger on PSN.

737
00:55:17,652 --> 00:55:19,734
[SPEAKER_07]: There's nothing wrong with another version of Chrono Trigger.

738
00:55:19,834 --> 00:55:24,199
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't think of one bad thing about being able to get Chrono Trigger on the PS3.

739
00:55:24,539 --> 00:55:27,663
[SPEAKER_07]: They could charge $50 for it and it would still be worth the money.

740
00:55:28,203 --> 00:55:32,866
[SPEAKER_07]: I ain't saying you should spend 50 bucks on Chrono Trigger, but if you did, I wouldn't be like, you're high.

741
00:55:32,966 --> 00:55:34,247
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd be like, high five.

742
00:55:34,447 --> 00:55:35,567
[SPEAKER_07]: Chrono Trigger kicks ass.

743
00:55:36,448 --> 00:55:38,129
[SPEAKER_03]: We should actually play our SNES one again.

744
00:55:39,310 --> 00:55:39,650
Yes.

745
00:55:40,350 --> 00:55:40,570
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

746
00:55:41,251 --> 00:55:42,672
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, here's some news.

747
00:55:42,692 --> 00:55:48,895
[SPEAKER_03]: This is kind of no one curve, but Harvest Moon is going to have a partner with a farm.

748
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:51,217
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually the Surrey Docks Farm.

749
00:55:52,834 --> 00:56:00,962
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're basically going to actually link the virtual environment to the real Surrey Docs farm.

750
00:56:01,483 --> 00:56:07,669
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's official and that's coming from Gary Jones who is the farm manager there.

751
00:56:08,549 --> 00:56:37,518
[SPEAKER_03]: he said we got along really well with the team and were very impressed with the Harvest Moon games since then we stayed in touch and will be looking to work together on future titles so they are merging real farming with virtual farming so when you go to milk your cute little cow somebody is going to be milking a not so cute little but cute cow I guess so yeah farm twinning and when they run into that tainted beef you will also get that tainted beef

752
00:56:39,310 --> 00:56:51,239
[SPEAKER_03]: and Frozen Synapse is a, has a new, you know, I would like to be able to speak English without going bleh.

753
00:56:51,839 --> 00:56:52,820
[SPEAKER_02]: Shut up.

754
00:56:52,860 --> 00:56:53,600
[SPEAKER_03]: You are not the count.

755
00:56:54,941 --> 00:56:55,882
[SPEAKER_03]: One, one mistake.

756
00:56:58,220 --> 00:57:01,643
[SPEAKER_03]: Frozen Synapse is going to star in a new Humble Indie Bundle.

757
00:57:02,244 --> 00:57:03,005
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

758
00:57:03,185 --> 00:57:05,207
[SPEAKER_03]: We know what the Humble Indie Bundle is, don't we, Dan?

759
00:57:05,567 --> 00:57:06,849
[SPEAKER_07]: I have no idea what you're talking about.

760
00:57:07,149 --> 00:57:10,753
[SPEAKER_03]: That where you pay what you want and the money gets donated.

761
00:57:11,013 --> 00:57:12,154
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember reading about that.

762
00:57:12,214 --> 00:57:15,858
[SPEAKER_07]: Didn't like the first time they did that like 70% of the people just stole the game anyway?

763
00:57:17,111 --> 00:57:18,232
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't think so.

764
00:57:18,272 --> 00:57:19,954
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they can pay a lot of money off of it.

765
00:57:20,575 --> 00:57:23,959
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's all gone to good causes.

766
00:57:24,019 --> 00:57:28,724
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway, Frozen Synapse is going to be included in the bundle.

767
00:57:29,525 --> 00:57:33,450
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you pay more than the average price, which is more than $4.27...

768
00:57:35,752 --> 00:57:44,856
[SPEAKER_03]: You also can get Humble Frozen Byte Bundle, which actually includes Trine, Shadowground, Shadowground Survivor, and the cancelled Jackclaw prototype.

769
00:57:45,536 --> 00:57:47,137
[SPEAKER_03]: And pre-order the coming Splat.

770
00:57:48,658 --> 00:57:52,960
[SPEAKER_03]: The money will go to Child's Play and the Electronic Frontier Foundation as you choose.

771
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:54,500
[SPEAKER_03]: So pretty cool, huh?

772
00:57:55,601 --> 00:57:55,921
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty cool.

773
00:57:56,463 --> 00:58:00,587
[SPEAKER_03]: and also Frozen Synapse is included on Linux.

774
00:58:00,767 --> 00:58:01,427
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's pretty neat.

775
00:58:01,808 --> 00:58:03,689
[SPEAKER_03]: And last but never least, Persona 4!

776
00:58:03,749 --> 00:58:10,715
[SPEAKER_03]: For all you people who like that weird game, there's going to be an anime version that's coming out in the US.

777
00:58:12,036 --> 00:58:18,221
[SPEAKER_03]: And it is going to be released in North America and have digital distribution.

778
00:58:18,821 --> 00:58:23,926
[SPEAKER_03]: The DVD and Blu-ray version are going to be out next year and it premieres in Japan on October 6th.

779
00:58:24,406 --> 00:58:31,770
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I was completely unaware until I was actually doing a search for, I was looking up an item for the new Professor Layton game coming out.

780
00:58:32,390 --> 00:58:36,092
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Professor Layton anime movie is actually coming out over here in November.

781
00:58:36,473 --> 00:58:36,713
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

782
00:58:36,873 --> 00:58:37,113
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cool.

783
00:58:37,133 --> 00:58:37,913
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is kind of interesting.

784
00:58:38,374 --> 00:58:47,298
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, something that fans of the series should be interested in too is it's actually got the same art director and the composer, Shigenori Soejima and Shouji Meguro.

785
00:58:47,579 --> 00:58:48,259
[SPEAKER_03]: So, pretty cool.

786
00:58:49,110 --> 00:58:53,034
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you seen that Konami has like a really blatant ripoff of Professor Layton?

787
00:58:53,634 --> 00:58:57,818
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, Dr. Loric and the something or other, I don't remember what it was.

788
00:58:58,218 --> 00:58:58,919
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to try to find it.

789
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:07,567
[SPEAKER_07]: When I first saw it, I was really excited because I thought it was a sequel to that Dr. Lortrek, whatever.

790
00:59:07,867 --> 00:59:09,368
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought it was a sequel to that...

791
00:59:10,989 --> 00:59:11,410
[SPEAKER_07]: What was it called?

792
00:59:11,430 --> 00:59:12,670
[SPEAKER_07]: It was like Henry Hatsworth.

793
00:59:12,870 --> 00:59:13,511
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

794
00:59:13,531 --> 00:59:16,392
[SPEAKER_07]: It was like a side-scrolling game that, you know, I played it in the store.

795
00:59:16,432 --> 00:59:19,553
[SPEAKER_07]: The guys, everyone was playing it in the store and they were just like, you gotta try this game when I try this game.

796
00:59:19,593 --> 00:59:20,834
[SPEAKER_03]: Your copy is sitting over there on my desk.

797
00:59:20,854 --> 00:59:22,655
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, this game is fucking amazing.

798
00:59:23,595 --> 00:59:30,038
[SPEAKER_07]: And I saw that and I saw this Professor of Lautrec and I was like, oh my god, is it a sequel to that?

799
00:59:30,198 --> 00:59:31,979
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, it's a Professor Layton rip-off.

800
00:59:31,999 --> 00:59:33,219
[SPEAKER_07]: A really obvious one, too.

801
00:59:33,259 --> 00:59:36,841
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, the guy looks like if he walked up to Professor Layton they would just be like, what up?

802
00:59:36,901 --> 00:59:37,561
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, what's going on?

803
00:59:37,581 --> 00:59:39,462
[SPEAKER_07]: And the guy would like twirl his mustache because he's evil.

804
00:59:41,311 --> 00:59:42,072
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuckin' Konami.

805
00:59:44,274 --> 00:59:46,217
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember when they made, like, cool original games?

806
00:59:46,897 --> 00:59:47,158
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

807
00:59:48,259 --> 00:59:51,603
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't they make Frogger one time?

808
00:59:52,003 --> 00:59:52,864
[SPEAKER_07]: They made Frogger.

809
00:59:53,144 --> 00:59:54,046
[SPEAKER_07]: They made Gradius.

810
00:59:55,067 --> 00:59:56,749
[SPEAKER_03]: They made Castle Freakin'vania.

811
00:59:56,969 --> 00:59:57,790
[SPEAKER_00]: Castlevania.

812
00:59:58,110 --> 00:59:58,851
[SPEAKER_00]: What the hell, okay?

813
01:00:00,233 --> 01:00:01,894
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do another Frogger game for the 3DS.

814
01:00:02,714 --> 01:00:03,374
[SPEAKER_07]: Whoa, hold on.

815
01:00:04,094 --> 01:00:05,875
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are you doing Frogger for the 3DS first?

816
01:00:06,035 --> 01:00:08,115
[SPEAKER_00]: Gradius for the 3DS would be perfect.

817
01:00:08,696 --> 01:00:11,056
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, they should do Solar Assault for the 3DS.

818
01:00:11,516 --> 01:00:13,657
[SPEAKER_07]: Solar Assault was a 3D Gradius.

819
01:00:14,597 --> 01:00:15,997
[SPEAKER_03]: How about YY Konami World?

820
01:00:17,118 --> 01:00:17,378
[SPEAKER_07]: Why?

821
01:00:18,658 --> 01:00:19,878
[SPEAKER_03]: Why, why?

822
01:00:20,519 --> 01:00:21,899
[SPEAKER_07]: Konami's YY Racing.

823
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:25,060
[SPEAKER_07]: That game was awesome.

824
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:25,460
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

825
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:27,480
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

826
01:00:28,381 --> 01:00:29,601
[SPEAKER_07]: Was that supposed to be the next story anyway?

827
01:00:30,954 --> 01:00:32,716
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that was actually Loki's turn.

828
01:00:33,537 --> 01:00:33,917
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm ready.

829
01:00:35,158 --> 01:00:37,360
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk a little bit about Nielsen ratings.

830
01:00:39,322 --> 01:00:40,123
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't agree with them.

831
01:00:40,943 --> 01:00:48,510
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, they have tapped what they call the top 10 anticipated games for 2011, for the fourth quarter.

832
01:00:54,095 --> 01:00:56,697
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, but there's a few things missing and a few things I don't agree on.

833
01:00:56,737 --> 01:01:00,320
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go down the list real quick and I can point that stuff out.

834
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:04,723
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, not very obvious, I'm sure.

835
01:01:05,163 --> 01:01:07,024
[SPEAKER_00]: Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 is number one.

836
01:01:07,584 --> 01:01:08,145
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.

837
01:01:08,285 --> 01:01:10,847
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be probably the biggest title this year.

838
01:01:12,528 --> 01:01:16,330
[SPEAKER_00]: Number two, and actually this is the top 20 to watch for the holiday 2011.

839
01:01:16,370 --> 01:01:16,611
[SPEAKER_00]: Gears of War 3.

840
01:01:19,841 --> 01:01:21,403
[SPEAKER_00]: Madden NFL 12 Assassin's Creed Revelations

841
01:01:36,665 --> 01:01:39,647
[SPEAKER_00]: Also kind of a no-brainer, you know, kind of expect that to do pretty well.

842
01:01:40,067 --> 01:01:42,068
[SPEAKER_00]: Batman Arkham City, I could see that.

843
01:01:43,649 --> 01:01:47,131
[SPEAKER_00]: The Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword, yeah, that makes sense.

844
01:01:48,331 --> 01:01:51,733
[SPEAKER_00]: Battlefield 3, of course, it's going to be a pretty big title.

845
01:01:52,954 --> 01:01:56,756
[SPEAKER_00]: Just Dance 3, yeah, on the Wii perhaps, I could see that.

846
01:01:57,896 --> 01:01:58,296
[SPEAKER_00]: NBA 2K12

847
01:02:00,774 --> 01:02:07,679
[SPEAKER_00]: Need for Speed, The Run, Uncharted 3, Mario & Sonic at the London 2012 Olympic Games, Lego Harry Potter Years 5-7, FIFA Soccer 12, The Elder Scrolls Skyrim,

848
01:02:27,632 --> 01:02:29,953
[SPEAKER_00]: That I would see doing a lot better than what they're saying.

849
01:02:30,393 --> 01:02:32,234
[SPEAKER_00]: Dead Island did really well.

850
01:02:32,534 --> 01:02:34,854
[SPEAKER_00]: I could see that maybe being a little higher up the list.

851
01:02:35,255 --> 01:02:36,875
[SPEAKER_00]: Kinect Sports Season 2.

852
01:02:37,595 --> 01:02:38,756
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is where I've got to stop them.

853
01:02:39,236 --> 01:02:42,977
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the first one did well, but I don't think the second one is going to sell that well at all.

854
01:02:43,757 --> 01:02:46,098
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, they have Dance Central 2 on the list.

855
01:02:46,338 --> 01:02:51,160
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I would hope that the second game will do just as well as the first game, but...

856
01:02:52,768 --> 01:03:04,479
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that it's going to Resistance 3, that's a pretty good first party title for Sony and finally, Deus Ex Human Revolution Where the fuck is Saints Row the 3rd on this list?

857
01:03:04,739 --> 01:03:18,612
[SPEAKER_00]: That game is going to do immensely well but it's just sadly missing or there's a bunch of other games that could be on this list that they're completely overlooking No one cares about the Nielsen's anyway

858
01:03:19,349 --> 01:03:21,330
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, they're just guessing what's going to be in the top five.

859
01:03:21,350 --> 01:03:24,473
[SPEAKER_07]: Nilsons don't even want to acknowledge that Saints Row the Third is going to exist.

860
01:03:25,153 --> 01:03:25,954
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's be honest, though.

861
01:03:25,974 --> 01:03:27,055
[SPEAKER_07]: Stick to TV, Nilsons.

862
01:03:27,255 --> 01:03:29,056
[SPEAKER_07]: Where the fuck is Grand Theft Auto V?

863
01:03:30,377 --> 01:03:32,058
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not coming out for a while.

864
01:03:32,358 --> 01:03:32,919
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I know.

865
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:38,503
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I want to play Saints Row the Third because I want to play Grand Theft Auto V. I just...

866
01:03:40,155 --> 01:03:43,317
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Grand Theft Auto V will probably be out by about a year's time.

867
01:03:43,397 --> 01:03:48,019
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, because they've already got their first half of 2012 already kind of spoken for.

868
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:58,224
[SPEAKER_00]: With Max Payne 3 and XCOM, I believe, are going to be the two games that... Well, no, actually XCOM is 2K, but not Rockstar.

869
01:03:58,285 --> 01:04:00,966
[SPEAKER_00]: But Max Payne 3, I know, is their spring title.

870
01:04:02,907 --> 01:04:04,248
[SPEAKER_07]: You've seen the trailer for Max Payne 3.

871
01:04:04,709 --> 01:04:07,391
[SPEAKER_07]: It started off and I was really stoked because he had hair.

872
01:04:08,252 --> 01:04:12,775
[SPEAKER_07]: And then he shaved his head and I was like, God damn it, Max Payne looks stupid bald.

873
01:04:15,017 --> 01:04:16,518
[SPEAKER_07]: It just really bothers me.

874
01:04:16,718 --> 01:04:19,360
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it just because he didn't want to render hair or something like that?

875
01:04:19,380 --> 01:04:21,342
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like when Snake was old in Metal Gear Solid 4.

876
01:04:22,423 --> 01:04:23,583
[SPEAKER_07]: That just pissed me off.

877
01:04:23,864 --> 01:04:26,906
[SPEAKER_07]: But then they made it so I could make him look young and I liked playing with him again.

878
01:04:27,226 --> 01:04:29,308
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate it when they make my game heroes look stupid.

879
01:04:29,963 --> 01:04:31,908
[SPEAKER_03]: He did have the Burt Reynolds stache.

880
01:04:32,209 --> 01:04:33,371
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, the Burt Reynolds stache was cool.

881
01:04:36,810 --> 01:04:52,103
[SPEAKER_00]: but yeah I mean they've got Max Payne 3 I know is coming and Agent is supposed to be the other thing they're working on right now but Agent got cancelled like a long time ago like I am alive ago yeah but L.A.

882
01:04:52,163 --> 01:05:03,473
[SPEAKER_00]: Noire that was also thought to be cancelled for a long time and it eventually came out Grand Theft Auto 5 I could see probably fourth quarter next year Agent could make me wait for Grand Theft Auto 5 if it's good

883
01:05:04,284 --> 01:05:07,051
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm really excited about the possibility of Agent being good.

884
01:05:08,018 --> 01:05:36,962
[SPEAKER_00]: LA Noire was awesome Red Dead Redemption was awesome you know if they keep bringing me other games to keep me busy I could like wait for GTA 5 but it's like seriously I've been dying just to go back and replay The Lost and Damned they don't understand how easy it is for them to in the meantime do something look at this trend that's going on right now with all these HD remakes of older games just take Grand Theft Auto 3 San Andreas San Andreas especially San Andreas

885
01:05:38,617 --> 01:05:41,700
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it some HD graphics, add multiplayer, boom!

886
01:05:41,940 --> 01:05:43,901
[SPEAKER_00]: Who gives a shit about Grand Theft Auto V for a while?

887
01:05:43,981 --> 01:05:47,804
[SPEAKER_07]: I would pay for those two games just to be imported into the Grand Theft Auto IV engine.

888
01:05:48,993 --> 01:06:14,376
[SPEAKER_00]: and they've done that and that's all they would have to do but I mean commercially not as a mod but commercially if they did those games in Grand Theft Auto 4 style I would like I would pay full price for the remakes I would you have a mod team of like maybe 5 people that did it in a couple months what's gonna happen when you have Rockstar that has the fucking tools to make these games they have all the assets to make these games

889
01:06:15,498 --> 01:06:18,361
[SPEAKER_00]: How long is it going to take a team of 30 people?

890
01:06:18,701 --> 01:06:20,502
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like printing fucking money.

891
01:06:21,303 --> 01:06:23,705
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like making your own money for God's sakes.

892
01:06:23,765 --> 01:06:24,726
[SPEAKER_07]: Just release them.

893
01:06:25,527 --> 01:06:27,829
[SPEAKER_07]: Give them to me and I will give you my money.

894
01:06:30,773 --> 01:06:31,773
[SPEAKER_00]: It wouldn't take that much.

895
01:06:31,913 --> 01:06:34,275
[SPEAKER_00]: And seriously, they could just piggyback it on the Rage Engine.

896
01:06:34,775 --> 01:06:36,036
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't even have to really tweak anything.

897
01:06:36,076 --> 01:06:39,759
[SPEAKER_00]: Just piggyback it on what it is now, and people would eat that shit.

898
01:06:39,939 --> 01:06:41,260
[SPEAKER_00]: You're talking like Game of the Year shit.

899
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:52,388
[SPEAKER_07]: Getting to the point where these games, I mean, not that it's ever going to be irrelevant in the video game world, but GTA is kind of losing its relevance because Call of Duty has taken over so big.

900
01:06:53,288 --> 01:07:06,175
[SPEAKER_07]: and and people are playing other things and you haven't heard from Grand Theft Auto which was at one time the dominator of the game world and it's just like where is it at god damn it

901
01:07:08,311 --> 01:07:08,771
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't wait.

902
01:07:09,192 --> 01:07:09,812
[SPEAKER_00]: Me either.

903
01:07:09,872 --> 01:07:11,213
[SPEAKER_00]: It's starting to piss me off.

904
01:07:11,233 --> 01:07:13,975
[SPEAKER_00]: I could absolutely see them do an HD San Andreas.

905
01:07:14,096 --> 01:07:14,896
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would make sense.

906
01:07:14,996 --> 01:07:17,518
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be amazing just to do that.

907
01:07:17,638 --> 01:07:20,240
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it's great, but it's really hard for me to go backwards.

908
01:07:20,601 --> 01:07:22,462
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I had a hard time going back.

909
01:07:22,482 --> 01:07:29,468
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I played through San Andreas after I played through GTA 4 while I was waiting for the episodes from Liberty City Pack.

910
01:07:29,688 --> 01:07:30,949
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I was like, well, screw this.

911
01:07:31,209 --> 01:07:33,090
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll go back now and I'll play Vice City.

912
01:07:33,250 --> 01:07:34,151
[SPEAKER_07]: And I couldn't do it.

913
01:07:34,572 --> 01:07:36,233
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just too funky.

914
01:07:38,467 --> 01:07:42,651
[SPEAKER_07]: The old Grand Theft Auto games were great games for their moment, but now they don't look very good.

915
01:07:42,671 --> 01:07:43,972
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't control very good.

916
01:07:44,432 --> 01:07:49,877
[SPEAKER_07]: Other than using cheat codes and running around and just doing messed up stuff, they're not really cool.

917
01:07:50,077 --> 01:07:55,042
[SPEAKER_07]: But you can still go back and play GTA 4 because GTA 4's got a really good physics engine.

918
01:07:55,062 --> 01:08:00,346
[SPEAKER_07]: The driving controls are... It's more fun to run around in.

919
01:08:00,546 --> 01:08:03,309
[SPEAKER_07]: But there's just not as much shit to do as there was in San Andreas.

920
01:08:03,489 --> 01:08:03,649
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

921
01:08:05,711 --> 01:08:07,652
[SPEAKER_07]: GTA V. It's like printing money.

922
01:08:08,952 --> 01:08:09,212
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it?

923
01:08:09,692 --> 01:08:09,872
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

924
01:08:10,733 --> 01:08:12,533
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I believe you, sort of.

925
01:08:14,774 --> 01:08:15,194
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there more?

926
01:08:17,535 --> 01:08:19,335
[SPEAKER_00]: Battlefield 3, that's almost like printing money.

927
01:08:19,876 --> 01:08:20,236
[SPEAKER_00]: Huh, Dan?

928
01:08:20,936 --> 01:08:21,676
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, is that my story?

929
01:08:22,316 --> 01:08:22,536
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

930
01:08:22,636 --> 01:08:23,457
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay, Battlefield 3!

931
01:08:24,608 --> 01:08:28,691
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, speaking of printing money, man, everyone is losing their minds for Battlefield 3.

932
01:08:29,672 --> 01:08:32,754
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, I'm not even following games that close and I keep hearing about it.

933
01:08:33,595 --> 01:08:45,624
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, apparently EA, in addition to just paying an assload of money to once again take a shot at knocking off Call of Duty, has decided that it's going to have a Battlefield 3 worldwide conquest tournament in early 2012 with $1.6 million in prizes.

934
01:08:51,741 --> 01:08:53,042
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

935
01:09:10,865 --> 01:09:14,609
[SPEAKER_07]: I always want to check out the battlefields, but they never hook me, honestly.

936
01:09:14,649 --> 01:09:20,415
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I hate to admit this, but I've played through the first two Modern Warfares, and I want to play through the third Modern Warfare.

937
01:09:20,756 --> 01:09:31,267
[SPEAKER_07]: I just don't want to pay for it, because I think Activision needs to be beat to death with a bag of rocks for how hard they fucked Infinity Ward.

938
01:09:31,807 --> 01:09:32,087
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

939
01:09:33,817 --> 01:09:34,277
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

940
01:09:34,397 --> 01:09:36,719
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm caught between a rock and a hard place.

941
01:09:36,739 --> 01:09:38,360
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd rather give Microsoft my money.

942
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:41,021
[SPEAKER_07]: So buy that Halo remake.

943
01:09:41,881 --> 01:09:42,882
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll see what happens.

944
01:09:42,962 --> 01:09:45,463
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure I'll get my hands on it somehow.

945
01:09:46,944 --> 01:09:47,505
[SPEAKER_07]: Possibly.

946
01:09:48,305 --> 01:09:48,745
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.

947
01:09:49,145 --> 01:09:55,509
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, if you kick ass at Battlefield 3, enter this tournament, win some money, and hook me up for money, you know about it.

948
01:09:56,809 --> 01:09:58,971
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, how about some frivolous lawsuits, huh?

949
01:09:59,352 --> 01:09:59,852
[SPEAKER_07]: And how?

950
01:10:00,833 --> 01:10:18,350
[SPEAKER_03]: Ultimate Pointer has filed patent lawsuits against Nintendo and a damn near bunch of everybody else for its, and I quote, easy deployable interactive direct-to-pointing system and presentation control system and calibration method, therefore.

951
01:10:18,891 --> 01:10:19,752
[SPEAKER_00]: I call it my finger.

952
01:10:22,738 --> 01:10:48,852
[SPEAKER_03]: but they filed their patent in May of 2005 although it didn't receive an official status until June 2010 which is four years after the Wii came out in the US anyway and they're also suing basically everyone that works with the Wii like anyone who's done games for the Wii in fact it's included retailers who are also involved too in making, using, importing and or selling of Wii systems, games and related accessories

953
01:10:49,693 --> 01:10:51,617
[SPEAKER_03]: Also called the Accused Products.

954
01:10:52,659 --> 01:10:53,541
[SPEAKER_03]: This will get thrown out.

955
01:10:53,722 --> 01:10:55,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, this is going to get completely pissed on by...

956
01:10:56,394 --> 01:10:57,294
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazon would just squash them.

957
01:11:25,144 --> 01:11:36,635
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Nintendo won't Oh, QVC, I mean, even But they're asking that Nintendo of America pay a reasonable royalty due to the alleged infringement Isn't QVC the home shopping channel?

958
01:11:36,675 --> 01:11:39,998
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, it is You ever see the video where the guy was washing the windows and he fell off the ladder?

959
01:11:41,259 --> 01:11:43,421
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw the one where the guy broke a TV with the Wiimote

960
01:11:43,735 --> 01:11:44,436
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a good one too.

961
01:11:45,156 --> 01:11:45,356
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

962
01:11:45,716 --> 01:11:52,941
[SPEAKER_07]: Watch the QVC video where the guy, he's like up in the background demonstrating like this ladder and he just falls right off it.

963
01:11:53,302 --> 01:11:54,202
[SPEAKER_07]: It's awesome.

964
01:11:55,163 --> 01:11:57,565
[SPEAKER_07]: People hurting themselves on QVC is cool.

965
01:12:00,687 --> 01:12:01,908
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad you think so.

966
01:12:02,628 --> 01:12:05,350
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, how about some FUs of the week, huh?

967
01:12:05,670 --> 01:12:07,392
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I think that we're angsty people.

968
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:28,641
[SPEAKER_03]: My FU of the week goes towards hotels near Disneyland for not being cheaper.

969
01:12:31,502 --> 01:12:31,822
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki?

970
01:12:33,342 --> 01:12:40,383
[SPEAKER_00]: FU goes to the stupid woman at Subway who doesn't understand how to put together a payment properly.

971
01:12:41,344 --> 01:12:42,724
[SPEAKER_00]: Or take instructions.

972
01:12:43,884 --> 01:12:44,404
[SPEAKER_00]: Or turkey.

973
01:12:44,784 --> 01:12:48,665
[SPEAKER_07]: Or give you a cup with Uncharted 3 demo on it.

974
01:12:50,168 --> 01:12:51,649
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to F you to Ultimate Pointer.

975
01:12:52,129 --> 01:12:52,949
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck those guys.

976
01:12:53,470 --> 01:12:54,270
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck them right in the ear.

977
01:12:55,491 --> 01:12:56,371
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, fuck them.

978
01:12:57,471 --> 01:13:00,073
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, we really got our angst up quickly, didn't we?

979
01:13:02,914 --> 01:13:06,976
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess we're all not all that pissed because we don't have Rob's soothing voice here to keep us happy, huh?

980
01:13:07,536 --> 01:13:08,757
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck Rob for that.

981
01:13:09,917 --> 01:13:10,258
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

982
01:13:10,278 --> 01:13:11,098
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck that guy.

983
01:13:12,058 --> 01:13:12,979
[SPEAKER_07]: You like Rob.

984
01:13:13,860 --> 01:13:16,281
[SPEAKER_07]: and fuck the people who keep making Penguin movies too.

985
01:13:17,001 --> 01:13:18,042
[SPEAKER_07]: God damn.

986
01:13:18,362 --> 01:13:27,606
[SPEAKER_07]: I was at the movie theater the other day and I mean I was there to see the Lion King 3D so you'd expect that I'm going to see this but I saw the commercial for Happy Feet 2 fucking twice and once was enough.

987
01:13:28,027 --> 01:13:28,807
[SPEAKER_07]: Dear God.

988
01:13:29,127 --> 01:13:30,648
[SPEAKER_07]: Did it really need a sequel?

989
01:13:32,129 --> 01:13:33,389
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck Penguin movies.

990
01:13:34,009 --> 01:13:35,170
[SPEAKER_03]: So do we have any more news Loki?

991
01:13:35,643 --> 01:13:36,124
[SPEAKER_07]: There's this new...

992
01:13:55,183 --> 01:13:55,964
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

993
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:19,503
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, of course, you know, they've got a few people in there that, you know, they're claiming, oh, I love games and stuff like that.

994
01:14:19,804 --> 01:14:25,766
[SPEAKER_00]: But then they've got actually some hardcore people that have, you know, Zelda tattoos and button tattoos and all crazy shit like that.

995
01:14:26,146 --> 01:14:34,230
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is a little bit more believable, but like, you know, rather than the, I remember one time my boyfriend played a game and it was just fun.

996
01:14:34,810 --> 01:14:35,811
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways, um...

997
01:14:36,491 --> 01:14:42,335
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, if you're interested, it is coming out quite soon from New Sensations.

998
01:14:43,496 --> 01:14:46,057
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's Geek Girls the Gamers.

999
01:14:47,959 --> 01:14:51,621
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, if that's not ridiculous enough like the Playboy spreads that they do.

1000
01:14:52,362 --> 01:15:00,727
[SPEAKER_00]: But this at least has actual people in it instead of, you know, Photoshop, CG, fake characters that are topless.

1001
01:15:02,168 --> 01:15:02,788
[SPEAKER_03]: Kids like boobs.

1002
01:15:04,269 --> 01:15:05,250
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially nursing children.

1003
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:10,240
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember BMX XXX?

1004
01:15:11,441 --> 01:15:20,005
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes That game was awesomely bad It was awesomely bad It was like Dave Mirab Freestyle BMX 2 but you could be naked

1005
01:15:20,543 --> 01:15:39,707
[SPEAKER_00]: but no it was an awesome game because not necessarily because of that because of all the missions that they would give you like you would have to it's like ridiculous shit like okay you're gonna have to pull off some tricks to get this dog horny so they'll go fuck another dog that's literally one of the missions in the first level of the game that is like one of like the first missions

1006
01:15:39,907 --> 01:15:45,832
[SPEAKER_00]: And then another one where you have to deliver hose to their clients using your bike.

1007
01:15:45,872 --> 01:15:46,673
[SPEAKER_02]: On the back of your bike.

1008
01:15:46,713 --> 01:15:47,473
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember that one.

1009
01:15:47,493 --> 01:15:48,915
[SPEAKER_07]: On the back of your BMX bike.

1010
01:15:49,215 --> 01:15:50,196
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what was great about that?

1011
01:15:50,256 --> 01:15:54,459
[SPEAKER_07]: Just go to the cheat code, enter Champagne Room, and then you can watch all the titty videos.

1012
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:55,961
[SPEAKER_07]: It's that simple.

1013
01:15:56,321 --> 01:15:56,941
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

1014
01:15:57,422 --> 01:16:01,185
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you can go play Matt Hoffman because Matt Hoffman was just a better game.

1015
01:16:02,150 --> 01:16:02,730
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that game.

1016
01:16:02,851 --> 01:16:03,751
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it was pretty good.

1017
01:16:04,112 --> 01:16:09,436
[SPEAKER_00]: It was ironic though that the PlayStation 2 and GameCube versions were uncensored.

1018
01:16:10,036 --> 01:16:12,938
[SPEAKER_00]: Or it was like the Xbox and GameCube versions were uncensored.

1019
01:16:13,599 --> 01:16:15,060
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know about the GameCube version.

1020
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:18,022
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that they gave me an Xbox version.

1021
01:16:18,363 --> 01:16:20,845
[SPEAKER_00]: The GameCube one was uncensored because that's what I had it on.

1022
01:16:22,079 --> 01:16:51,097
[SPEAKER_03]: and like didn't some like girl family sue after the fact cause she was under no that was Dave Mira sued no that was the um that was the Girls Gone Wild the guy game oh that was it yeah I don't even remember being sued it was just that some underage girl managed to sneak into it and then they were like you can't sell that game anymore I'm like that's fine we weren't selling it to start with so one more story and then we're gonna open up the skyplane sounds good oh sure

1023
01:16:52,358 --> 01:16:58,222
[SPEAKER_07]: So apparently, Microsoft is looking into auto-mature filtering options.

1024
01:16:58,943 --> 01:17:01,365
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't really understand what I'm reading here.

1025
01:17:01,705 --> 01:17:06,408
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess they did it a while ago where you can go ahead and set the games up so they won't be quite as mature.

1026
01:17:06,889 --> 01:17:09,450
[SPEAKER_07]: Which I think, honestly, is a pretty decent idea.

1027
01:17:09,791 --> 01:17:14,814
[SPEAKER_07]: Because, you know, you really want to make Gears of War a little warmer and more cuddly so your 8-year-old can play it.

1028
01:17:15,435 --> 01:17:15,775
[SPEAKER_07]: Really?

1029
01:17:17,096 --> 01:17:18,757
[SPEAKER_07]: They ought to make that game two ways.

1030
01:17:19,357 --> 01:17:21,339
[SPEAKER_07]: Violent and ultra-violent.

1031
01:17:23,533 --> 01:17:28,756
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is not part of a show role, but did you notice there was a story this week?

1032
01:17:28,836 --> 01:17:33,618
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone had actually built a full-size Lancer out of Legos.

1033
01:17:33,839 --> 01:17:34,819
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, really?

1034
01:17:35,499 --> 01:17:36,760
[SPEAKER_07]: That dude is my hero.

1035
01:17:38,001 --> 01:17:38,681
[SPEAKER_07]: And it works.

1036
01:17:38,841 --> 01:17:40,622
[SPEAKER_03]: We were a two-Lancer family at one time.

1037
01:17:41,122 --> 01:17:43,464
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, not Mitsubishi Lancer, you dork.

1038
01:17:44,784 --> 01:17:46,145
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the gun from Gears of War.

1039
01:17:46,225 --> 01:17:49,567
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, I was being silly.

1040
01:17:51,127 --> 01:17:54,369
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm opening the skyline now because I'm tired of listening to Dan.

1041
01:17:55,810 --> 01:17:56,531
[SPEAKER_07]: You live with me.

1042
01:17:56,551 --> 01:17:58,352
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to listen to me all the time.

1043
01:17:58,432 --> 01:17:59,773
[SPEAKER_03]: I could just go back to Rob's house.

1044
01:18:00,113 --> 01:18:01,954
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to Rob's house.

1045
01:18:02,175 --> 01:18:04,016
[SPEAKER_00]: They were talking about Road Rash real quick.

1046
01:18:04,156 --> 01:18:04,456
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

1047
01:18:04,596 --> 01:18:07,899
[SPEAKER_00]: That was one of those games that, remember, it was the Burnout Team.

1048
01:18:07,959 --> 01:18:10,200
[SPEAKER_00]: Criterion, I think, was actually going to put out a new version.

1049
01:18:10,220 --> 01:18:11,181
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my God.

1050
01:18:11,241 --> 01:18:12,502
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be amazing.

1051
01:18:12,522 --> 01:18:14,383
[SPEAKER_00]: The video was fucking amazing.

1052
01:18:14,403 --> 01:18:15,624
[SPEAKER_00]: You say they were going to or they are going to?

1053
01:18:15,804 --> 01:18:16,504
[SPEAKER_00]: They were going to.

1054
01:18:16,524 --> 01:18:17,105
[SPEAKER_00]: It got canceled.

1055
01:18:17,165 --> 01:18:18,546
[SPEAKER_07]: Why would they not do that?

1056
01:18:18,786 --> 01:18:19,567
[SPEAKER_07]: They work for EA.

1057
01:18:19,607 --> 01:18:19,767
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1058
01:18:20,748 --> 01:18:21,509
[SPEAKER_07]: This needs to happen.

1059
01:18:21,529 --> 01:18:23,212
[SPEAKER_07]: Does anybody know someone at EA?

1060
01:18:23,833 --> 01:18:24,073
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1061
01:18:24,434 --> 01:18:25,135
[SPEAKER_07]: For the record.

1062
01:18:25,175 --> 01:18:27,018
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, don't have a make more need for speeds.

1063
01:18:27,078 --> 01:18:29,622
[SPEAKER_07]: For God's sakes, have Criterion make a road rush.

1064
01:18:29,883 --> 01:18:30,844
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, fuck that noise.

1065
01:18:31,105 --> 01:18:33,348
[SPEAKER_07]: Why isn't Criterion making a new Burnout?

1066
01:18:34,321 --> 01:18:35,802
[SPEAKER_03]: So the skyline is open.

1067
01:18:35,922 --> 01:18:39,104
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, I need to get that.

1068
01:18:39,124 --> 01:18:43,227
[SPEAKER_03]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or see us on Skype at Orange Lounge Radio.

1069
01:18:43,587 --> 01:18:44,668
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we're awesome.

1070
01:18:44,848 --> 01:18:45,889
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see us on Skype.

1071
01:18:46,109 --> 01:18:51,713
[SPEAKER_03]: Until then, I'm going to read some of our very, very few tinky Twitter topics.

1072
01:18:52,793 --> 01:18:56,176
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't want to use whatever song that... Oh, we actually have a caller.

1073
01:18:56,716 --> 01:18:57,697
[SPEAKER_03]: So I will answer this first.

1074
01:18:58,888 --> 01:18:59,709
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, it's CD Thunder.

1075
01:18:59,729 --> 01:18:59,829
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1076
01:18:59,849 --> 01:18:59,929
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1077
01:19:21,903 --> 01:19:30,425
[SPEAKER_06]: I played the first Contra a little bit, but I just wanted to actually get your guys' opinions on Contra.

1078
01:19:31,786 --> 01:19:35,907
[SPEAKER_03]: Contra is if you really hate yourself and want to be defeated at every turn.

1079
01:19:36,907 --> 01:19:43,029
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, it was really hard because I couldn't even get past the first level without dying like five or six times.

1080
01:19:43,769 --> 01:19:44,249
[SPEAKER_06]: Practice.

1081
01:19:45,130 --> 01:19:46,390
[SPEAKER_06]: Contra's not very difficult.

1082
01:19:48,194 --> 01:19:51,075
[SPEAKER_06]: Contra is the kind of game that when you know where everything is going to come from, you'll be fine.

1083
01:19:51,095 --> 01:19:52,395
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not hard if you know how to play it.

1084
01:19:52,695 --> 01:19:53,955
[SPEAKER_07]: I really don't know how.

1085
01:19:54,776 --> 01:19:55,616
[SPEAKER_03]: So what was your other topic?

1086
01:19:56,696 --> 01:19:57,716
[SPEAKER_07]: Play the Contra on the Super NES.

1087
01:19:59,677 --> 01:19:59,997
[SPEAKER_06]: Say what?

1088
01:20:00,157 --> 01:20:01,137
[SPEAKER_03]: What was your second topic?

1089
01:20:02,097 --> 01:20:05,598
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it's about Metal Slug.

1090
01:20:06,658 --> 01:20:07,419
[SPEAKER_03]: I love Metal Slug.

1091
01:20:08,059 --> 01:20:08,899
[SPEAKER_03]: I like Camel Slug.

1092
01:20:10,541 --> 01:20:17,646
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw the Orange Slug Radio YouTube video that showed the inside of your vault.

1093
01:20:18,946 --> 01:20:22,489
[SPEAKER_06]: And I noticed they had a copy of Metal Slug Anthology.

1094
01:20:22,969 --> 01:20:23,389
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, we do.

1095
01:20:23,930 --> 01:20:24,210
[SPEAKER_06]: Indeed.

1096
01:20:25,170 --> 01:20:29,473
[SPEAKER_03]: And a bunch of other different Metal Slugs somewhere on various things.

1097
01:20:29,493 --> 01:20:31,815
[SPEAKER_06]: Ironically enough, I own no Metal Slug for the actual Neo Geo.

1098
01:20:31,835 --> 01:20:33,175
[SPEAKER_06]: Metal Slug, I really like that.

1099
01:20:33,235 --> 01:20:33,496
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean...

1100
01:20:35,549 --> 01:20:36,890
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really basic.

1101
01:20:36,950 --> 01:20:40,492
[SPEAKER_06]: All you do is you have a character and you go around killing people.

1102
01:20:40,652 --> 01:20:43,413
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, how can it get any more basic?

1103
01:20:44,233 --> 01:20:46,094
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have a copy of Metal Slug Anthology?

1104
01:20:47,355 --> 01:20:48,175
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I don't actually.

1105
01:20:48,195 --> 01:20:49,016
[SPEAKER_07]: You should get one.

1106
01:20:51,897 --> 01:20:52,678
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really epic.

1107
01:20:52,818 --> 01:20:55,259
[SPEAKER_07]: It's worth owning if you're a fan of run-and-gun games.

1108
01:20:57,079 --> 01:21:01,203
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically all the Contras, all the Metal Slugs are just the best run and gun games you can get.

1109
01:21:02,365 --> 01:21:05,108
[SPEAKER_07]: If you go out and buy them and play them, you will be happy.

1110
01:21:05,348 --> 01:21:06,950
[SPEAKER_07]: And happiness is what you want, right?

1111
01:21:07,650 --> 01:21:09,132
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, pretty much.

1112
01:21:09,412 --> 01:21:10,433
[SPEAKER_03]: Happiness in game form.

1113
01:21:10,493 --> 01:21:12,235
[SPEAKER_06]: Kill all who oppose you.

1114
01:21:13,296 --> 01:21:13,997
[SPEAKER_03]: Words to live by.

1115
01:21:14,778 --> 01:21:15,679
[SPEAKER_03]: Got anything else for us tonight?

1116
01:21:16,345 --> 01:21:18,706
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, a couple last minute things.

1117
01:21:19,086 --> 01:21:19,386
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1118
01:21:20,706 --> 01:21:24,507
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to talk about two of my favorite games to play in the arcade.

1119
01:21:24,567 --> 01:21:25,787
[SPEAKER_03]: How about one of your favorite games?

1120
01:21:25,807 --> 01:21:27,388
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we've got to let other callers come in.

1121
01:21:28,188 --> 01:21:28,508
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1122
01:21:29,428 --> 01:21:34,069
[SPEAKER_06]: One of my favorite arcade games to play was, I'm not sure if you've heard of this one, it's called CarnEvil.

1123
01:21:34,749 --> 01:21:36,130
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I know CarnEvil.

1124
01:21:36,170 --> 01:21:37,030
[SPEAKER_03]: That game was awful.

1125
01:21:39,355 --> 01:21:40,216
[SPEAKER_06]: Why don't you like it?

1126
01:21:40,316 --> 01:21:40,716
[SPEAKER_06]: I liked it.

1127
01:21:40,756 --> 01:21:41,617
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it was awful.

1128
01:21:41,977 --> 01:21:43,758
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a gun game.

1129
01:21:43,818 --> 01:21:45,098
[SPEAKER_07]: It wasn't very challenging either.

1130
01:21:45,119 --> 01:21:46,799
[SPEAKER_07]: It wasn't a good gun game.

1131
01:21:46,879 --> 01:21:48,380
[SPEAKER_06]: And I hate clowns.

1132
01:21:48,420 --> 01:21:50,101
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm glad that you like it.

1133
01:21:50,461 --> 01:21:52,623
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very popular.

1134
01:21:52,663 --> 01:21:54,203
[SPEAKER_06]: You see those machines everywhere.

1135
01:21:54,644 --> 01:21:57,645
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that I hate clowns so much that I didn't even enjoy shooting them.

1136
01:21:58,546 --> 01:21:59,426
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

1137
01:21:59,626 --> 01:22:00,627
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I can understand that.

1138
01:22:01,215 --> 01:22:03,636
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well thanks for giving us a call today, CD Thunder.

1139
01:22:04,217 --> 01:22:05,377
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, thank you.

1140
01:22:05,958 --> 01:22:07,639
[SPEAKER_00]: We all float down here at Georgie.

1141
01:22:07,699 --> 01:22:16,744
[SPEAKER_00]: I sent Jamie, real quick, because I know this is going to make amazing radio, that trailer for the new Road Rash game.

1142
01:22:16,824 --> 01:22:20,686
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pre-visual thing that this guy is working on.

1143
01:22:20,886 --> 01:22:21,066
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude.

1144
01:22:21,226 --> 01:22:24,128
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude.

1145
01:22:26,738 --> 01:22:32,863
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have a bike, and the life bar is a chain going to a deformed skull.

1146
01:22:32,923 --> 01:22:34,164
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, that dude kicked a van.

1147
01:22:35,325 --> 01:22:35,845
[SPEAKER_07]: Now kick him.

1148
01:22:36,125 --> 01:22:36,506
[SPEAKER_07]: Kick him!

1149
01:22:36,806 --> 01:22:37,486
[SPEAKER_07]: In the face!

1150
01:22:38,167 --> 01:22:39,748
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, oh, dude, he's grappling him.

1151
01:22:42,410 --> 01:22:43,871
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you should have pushed him into that car.

1152
01:22:44,071 --> 01:22:45,813
[SPEAKER_07]: I would buy, like, five copies of this.

1153
01:22:49,956 --> 01:22:50,116
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh!

1154
01:22:50,196 --> 01:22:51,177
[SPEAKER_03]: Got told.

1155
01:22:52,338 --> 01:22:55,040
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you can see that some of the cars are untextured, so, yeah.

1156
01:22:55,080 --> 01:22:56,301
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, yeah, it's all pre-biz, so...

1157
01:23:00,174 --> 01:23:03,935
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty cool.

1158
01:23:03,955 --> 01:23:08,256
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well hey, we got another caller coming in, so we're going to put this up on our Tumblr.

1159
01:23:08,296 --> 01:23:09,077
[SPEAKER_03]: How does that sound?

1160
01:23:09,097 --> 01:23:11,197
[SPEAKER_03]: I detect so much hotness.

1161
01:23:14,538 --> 01:23:15,839
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, this is Orange Jones Radio.

1162
01:23:15,899 --> 01:23:16,259
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this?

1163
01:23:16,919 --> 01:23:18,239
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, it's the one and only Ranma.

1164
01:23:18,380 --> 01:23:20,060
[SPEAKER_03]: Ranchan, hi.

1165
01:23:20,220 --> 01:23:20,840
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you?

1166
01:23:20,860 --> 01:23:20,940
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.

1167
01:23:21,621 --> 01:23:22,141
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing good.

1168
01:23:22,161 --> 01:23:22,621
[SPEAKER_01]: How about you?

1169
01:23:23,141 --> 01:23:25,262
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kind of wishing Rob was here.

1170
01:23:25,722 --> 01:23:26,322
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.

1171
01:23:26,966 --> 01:23:30,430
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, before I continue, I have to tell everyone in the chat room, take two drinks.

1172
01:23:31,472 --> 01:23:31,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

1173
01:23:33,775 --> 01:23:37,660
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there is a drinking game where everyone has to do like one or two shots when I call in, so.

1174
01:23:38,020 --> 01:23:38,360
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

1175
01:23:38,481 --> 01:23:39,542
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we've got apple wine.

1176
01:23:39,562 --> 01:23:40,043
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that count?

1177
01:23:41,304 --> 01:23:41,785
[SPEAKER_01]: Good enough.

1178
01:23:42,065 --> 01:23:42,305
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

1179
01:23:42,726 --> 01:23:45,529
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, no, I think I've got like some vodka left over from three years ago.

1180
01:23:46,614 --> 01:23:51,177
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a bottle of root beer flavored vodka in my cabinet.

1181
01:23:51,217 --> 01:23:57,661
[SPEAKER_01]: Went looking for it the other day and it was empty and I realized my other friend who was the local Jack Daniels guy drank it.

1182
01:23:59,862 --> 01:24:04,545
[SPEAKER_03]: For the record, we do have that vanilla vodka on top of the fridge that I got for the party and no one ever opened.

1183
01:24:05,465 --> 01:24:06,566
[SPEAKER_03]: Like my birthday three years ago.

1184
01:24:06,946 --> 01:24:07,206
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

1185
01:24:07,226 --> 01:24:07,486
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

1186
01:24:07,626 --> 01:24:08,166
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still there?

1187
01:24:08,466 --> 01:24:08,627
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1188
01:24:08,827 --> 01:24:09,207
[SPEAKER_03]: So, hi.

1189
01:24:09,227 --> 01:24:10,547
[SPEAKER_03]: So, what's up?

1190
01:24:10,627 --> 01:24:11,827
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I drank that when you weren't looking.

1191
01:24:11,847 --> 01:24:12,548
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't drink.

1192
01:24:12,868 --> 01:24:14,548
[SPEAKER_07]: I drank the shit out of that vodka.

1193
01:24:14,608 --> 01:24:15,629
[SPEAKER_03]: You cannot hold your liquor.

1194
01:24:15,669 --> 01:24:16,529
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, clang!

1195
01:24:17,089 --> 01:24:23,031
[SPEAKER_03]: He has, if he did one shot, he would be red in the face and sitting on the couch falling asleep.

1196
01:24:23,331 --> 01:24:24,171
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not true.

1197
01:24:24,211 --> 01:24:25,371
[SPEAKER_03]: That is, okay, two shots.

1198
01:24:25,671 --> 01:24:26,972
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, it probably wouldn't even take one.

1199
01:24:27,852 --> 01:24:28,132
[SPEAKER_03]: See?

1200
01:24:28,152 --> 01:24:31,453
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Dan's a lush?

1201
01:24:31,753 --> 01:24:31,953
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

1202
01:24:31,973 --> 01:24:32,653
[SPEAKER_07]: No, Dan's not.

1203
01:24:32,693 --> 01:24:33,414
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie's a lush.

1204
01:24:33,434 --> 01:24:34,834
[SPEAKER_07]: Dan's not a very good alcoholic.

1205
01:24:36,141 --> 01:24:39,084
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Jamie, you and Patty would have fun together.

1206
01:24:39,904 --> 01:24:43,487
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to come out to your neck of the woods and go drinking with you and Patty.

1207
01:24:45,209 --> 01:24:47,130
[SPEAKER_01]: That means y'all would be raiding my liquor cabinet.

1208
01:24:47,170 --> 01:24:48,191
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that I would be complaining.

1209
01:24:48,211 --> 01:24:51,014
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd be contributing to your liquor cabinet and getting you good beer.

1210
01:24:52,435 --> 01:24:55,397
[SPEAKER_01]: See, that's why I have parties to get rid of the alcohol.

1211
01:24:55,437 --> 01:24:58,500
[SPEAKER_01]: At the end of the night, I open up the cabinet and I'm like, where did all of this come from?

1212
01:24:58,837 --> 01:25:00,638
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's why for my birthday I have the beer potluck.

1213
01:25:01,759 --> 01:25:01,859
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah.

1214
01:25:03,280 --> 01:25:06,903
[SPEAKER_03]: So, how about the show so far, huh?

1215
01:25:07,643 --> 01:25:08,804
[SPEAKER_01]: So far, so good.

1216
01:25:08,964 --> 01:25:11,746
[SPEAKER_01]: I give it three out of four train wrecks.

1217
01:25:12,167 --> 01:25:14,108
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so we're not a derp-isode fully?

1218
01:25:14,728 --> 01:25:15,469
[SPEAKER_03]: We're a minor derp?

1219
01:25:16,970 --> 01:25:17,931
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you talking about?

1220
01:25:18,691 --> 01:25:19,672
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my podcast.

1221
01:25:19,712 --> 01:25:20,973
[SPEAKER_01]: We're the derpy ones.

1222
01:25:21,013 --> 01:25:22,514
[SPEAKER_01]: We derail under five minutes.

1223
01:25:23,154 --> 01:25:26,697
[SPEAKER_07]: Any show that I appear on for the whole show is immediately awesome.

1224
01:25:27,443 --> 01:25:30,605
[SPEAKER_03]: I've just been letting them get out their testosterone-ing, so it's been cool.

1225
01:25:32,065 --> 01:25:32,625
[SPEAKER_01]: Fair enough.

1226
01:25:34,086 --> 01:25:35,107
[SPEAKER_01]: So what else is on your mind?

1227
01:25:35,807 --> 01:25:39,369
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think it was last weekend, I believe.

1228
01:25:39,569 --> 01:25:41,370
[SPEAKER_01]: It was me, Patty, and Zeeba.

1229
01:25:41,410 --> 01:25:46,712
[SPEAKER_01]: We went down to the Jersey Shore, and Zeeba pointed us to a classic arcade.

1230
01:25:47,673 --> 01:25:47,993
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

1231
01:25:48,173 --> 01:25:49,053
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, so cool.

1232
01:25:49,213 --> 01:25:51,394
[SPEAKER_03]: So what else did they have at the classic arcade?

1233
01:25:51,935 --> 01:25:52,635
[SPEAKER_03]: Were there tons of pins?

1234
01:25:53,595 --> 01:25:54,236
[SPEAKER_01]: Super Mario Bros.

1235
01:25:54,496 --> 01:25:55,237
[SPEAKER_01]: and Ninja Turtles

1236
01:26:13,857 --> 01:26:15,138
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, those are both really good.

1237
01:26:39,312 --> 01:26:41,633
[SPEAKER_07]: Ninja Turtles, though, got harder when you had more people.

1238
01:26:41,973 --> 01:26:42,614
[SPEAKER_07]: It was great.

1239
01:26:42,634 --> 01:26:44,154
[SPEAKER_07]: Gauntlet actually got easier.

1240
01:26:44,214 --> 01:26:45,295
[SPEAKER_07]: You could last longer.

1241
01:26:47,156 --> 01:26:49,557
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you got me thinking of Gauntlet 2 for Nintendo.

1242
01:26:49,597 --> 01:26:50,817
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought I'd beat that game.

1243
01:26:51,098 --> 01:26:53,839
[SPEAKER_01]: After 150 levels, I set the hell with it and walked away.

1244
01:26:54,019 --> 01:26:56,080
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I never got Gauntlet 2 on the NES.

1245
01:26:57,026 --> 01:27:18,637
[SPEAKER_07]: and I really wish that I had because it's actually kind of a cool little version I do have Gauntlet 4 for the Genesis which is basically Gauntlet 1 for the Genesis and it's got a quest mode and it's actually four players if you have a multi-tap but I've never managed to get four people on it at once it's one of the failures of my life well I can get you a copy of Gauntlet 2 that's not too hard

1246
01:27:19,219 --> 01:27:20,760
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't really need one at this point.

1247
01:27:20,981 --> 01:27:21,521
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just saying.

1248
01:27:21,541 --> 01:27:22,962
[SPEAKER_07]: I never picked it up back in the day.

1249
01:27:23,442 --> 01:27:26,164
[SPEAKER_07]: And watching videos and stuff of it later on, I kind of wish that I had.

1250
01:27:26,445 --> 01:27:28,106
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it looks like it was pretty choice.

1251
01:27:30,848 --> 01:27:31,468
[SPEAKER_01]: Indeed it was.

1252
01:27:31,488 --> 01:27:33,149
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish I had picked up the strategy guide for it.

1253
01:27:33,450 --> 01:27:33,750
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh well.

1254
01:27:34,050 --> 01:27:34,651
[SPEAKER_01]: It is what it is.

1255
01:27:35,891 --> 01:27:38,273
[SPEAKER_03]: So there were pinball tables there though, right?

1256
01:27:38,633 --> 01:27:38,854
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

1257
01:27:40,075 --> 01:27:44,798
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my friends, Ari, he was playing pinball while I was chucking quarters into a theater of magic machines.

1258
01:27:46,054 --> 01:27:48,017
[SPEAKER_03]: Theater Magic is awesome.

1259
01:27:49,378 --> 01:27:54,584
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I left that and I went to play this large old school Atari pinball machine.

1260
01:27:56,387 --> 01:27:57,188
[SPEAKER_07]: Was it Hercules?

1261
01:27:57,668 --> 01:27:58,169
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it was.

1262
01:27:58,609 --> 01:28:01,693
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone in chat mentioned Hercules.

1263
01:28:01,713 --> 01:28:03,395
[SPEAKER_07]: I've never played a Hercules machine.

1264
01:28:03,435 --> 01:28:04,937
[SPEAKER_07]: I've seen the back glass for once.

1265
01:28:05,894 --> 01:28:12,879
[SPEAKER_01]: It took me five minutes, like five tries to figure out how to play this stupid thing because I'm pulling it back thinking all I gotta do is send it forward.

1266
01:28:12,939 --> 01:28:17,462
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I gotta push back and shove it forth like a plunger and send the ball rolling.

1267
01:28:20,606 --> 01:28:28,228
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that sounds like, you know, something just makes me think that I have seen one before, though, at one of the pinball.

1268
01:28:28,808 --> 01:28:31,349
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't they have one at one of the pinball things we went to, Dan?

1269
01:28:32,089 --> 01:28:32,709
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought that they did.

1270
01:28:32,729 --> 01:28:35,110
[SPEAKER_07]: They didn't have a Hercules, I don't think.

1271
01:28:35,310 --> 01:28:36,710
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they just had that giant size old one.

1272
01:28:36,730 --> 01:28:37,971
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just a giant mock-up.

1273
01:28:38,371 --> 01:28:45,693
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that used a pool cue, a cue ball for the pin, for the pinball.

1274
01:28:48,031 --> 01:28:48,831
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds pretty cool.

1275
01:28:49,112 --> 01:28:59,254
[SPEAKER_03]: It was pretty cool, but it got boring after five minutes because I could not reach from one side to the other very easily because of my short arms.

1276
01:28:59,494 --> 01:29:02,175
[SPEAKER_03]: How classic was classic?

1277
01:29:02,215 --> 01:29:09,957
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it just like that 80s era or did it get into the later 90s or was it just like early 80s to mid 90s?

1278
01:29:10,957 --> 01:29:15,918
[SPEAKER_01]: The only machine in this one section that was current was a DDR Max 2 machine.

1279
01:29:16,206 --> 01:29:16,386
[SPEAKER_03]: Fragile

1280
01:29:45,356 --> 01:29:46,616
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'll think about it.

1281
01:29:46,816 --> 01:29:49,877
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me wait until the semester's over and then I'll see if I can be shipped.

1282
01:29:51,277 --> 01:29:51,797
[SPEAKER_01]: Fair enough.

1283
01:29:52,217 --> 01:29:55,998
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Patty would love that because she's about to spaz at her job, so.

1284
01:29:57,959 --> 01:29:59,099
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been hearing.

1285
01:30:00,279 --> 01:30:01,880
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, she's now an assistant manager.

1286
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:03,480
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel very sorry for her.

1287
01:30:05,960 --> 01:30:06,981
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes two of us.

1288
01:30:07,281 --> 01:30:07,541
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1289
01:30:08,521 --> 01:30:10,641
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you got anything else for us tonight?

1290
01:30:12,362 --> 01:30:12,502
[SPEAKER_01]: Um...

1291
01:30:14,597 --> 01:30:15,597
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, no, that's it.

1292
01:30:15,997 --> 01:30:16,358
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1293
01:30:17,738 --> 01:30:19,839
[SPEAKER_07]: Ranma, before you go, I want you to do something for me.

1294
01:30:20,659 --> 01:30:21,199
[SPEAKER_01]: That being?

1295
01:30:21,459 --> 01:30:21,979
[SPEAKER_07]: Stay black.

1296
01:30:23,920 --> 01:30:24,400
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no.

1297
01:30:24,480 --> 01:30:25,600
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't stay black anymore.

1298
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:26,621
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not my style.

1299
01:30:26,641 --> 01:30:27,461
[SPEAKER_07]: What the fuck did I say?

1300
01:30:27,681 --> 01:30:28,321
[SPEAKER_07]: Stay black.

1301
01:30:28,701 --> 01:30:30,002
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I stay nerdy, man.

1302
01:30:30,182 --> 01:30:30,822
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay nerdy.

1303
01:30:30,942 --> 01:30:31,422
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay that too.

1304
01:30:31,462 --> 01:30:32,382
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep it nerdy, motherfucker.

1305
01:30:32,422 --> 01:30:33,022
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep it nerdy.

1306
01:30:33,663 --> 01:30:34,023
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1307
01:30:34,523 --> 01:30:34,803
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

1308
01:30:35,123 --> 01:30:36,123
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for calling in.

1309
01:30:36,503 --> 01:30:36,844
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1310
01:30:36,944 --> 01:30:37,584
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye, Ronton.

1311
01:30:37,864 --> 01:30:38,224
[SPEAKER_07]: Stay black.

1312
01:30:38,244 --> 01:30:38,344
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye.

1313
01:30:40,279 --> 01:30:42,121
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, we will take a couple more calls.

1314
01:30:42,381 --> 01:30:44,724
[SPEAKER_03]: It's 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1315
01:30:44,784 --> 01:30:51,691
[SPEAKER_03]: In the interim, I will go ahead and see what is on our Twitter.

1316
01:30:52,112 --> 01:30:57,157
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a mention from Nico Nico-chan.

1317
01:30:57,197 --> 01:30:58,338
[SPEAKER_03]: This is tweet heart.

1318
01:30:59,619 --> 01:31:02,522
[SPEAKER_03]: Tiger Claw sends us a story about...

1319
01:31:04,503 --> 01:31:06,184
[SPEAKER_03]: Dota 2 wants you.

1320
01:31:06,345 --> 01:31:06,985
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you ready?

1321
01:31:07,345 --> 01:31:14,271
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a big fan wanting a beta key that they put up a sign.

1322
01:31:14,651 --> 01:31:15,992
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's kind of interesting.

1323
01:31:16,833 --> 01:31:19,295
[SPEAKER_03]: You paid $3,000 for an electronic billboard.

1324
01:31:19,315 --> 01:31:20,116
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty crazy.

1325
01:31:20,136 --> 01:31:21,017
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't actually pay $3,000.

1326
01:31:21,137 --> 01:31:21,937
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just photoshopped?

1327
01:31:22,218 --> 01:31:22,658
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.

1328
01:31:22,758 --> 01:31:27,542
[SPEAKER_00]: What ended up happening is it would have cost him $3,000 to normally rent one of those signs for a month.

1329
01:31:27,842 --> 01:31:28,183
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura.com

1330
01:31:44,432 --> 01:31:44,852
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I see.

1331
01:31:45,172 --> 01:31:45,873
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's pretty cool.

1332
01:31:46,673 --> 01:31:47,753
[SPEAKER_03]: The links people will go to.

1333
01:31:48,894 --> 01:31:53,075
[SPEAKER_03]: Guys, we're taking one more call, so that's 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1334
01:31:53,395 --> 01:31:59,598
[SPEAKER_03]: We also have another one from Tigerclaw about Gotham City Impostors beta beginning on October 5th.

1335
01:32:01,478 --> 01:32:03,419
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a PC game.

1336
01:32:04,019 --> 01:32:04,440
[SPEAKER_03]: Weird.

1337
01:32:05,780 --> 01:32:12,162
[SPEAKER_03]: And Steam codes have already been mailed out to those who are accepted, and the client can be downloaded now, but the beta will not begin until next week.

1338
01:32:12,483 --> 01:32:13,463
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yay.

1339
01:32:13,483 --> 01:32:13,563
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1340
01:32:15,117 --> 01:32:15,617
[SPEAKER_03]: Any more calls?

1341
01:32:18,360 --> 01:32:19,020
[SPEAKER_03]: They're afraid of you.

1342
01:32:19,060 --> 01:32:20,462
[SPEAKER_03]: They're intimidated by your awesomeness.

1343
01:32:23,044 --> 01:32:29,610
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone call Dan so I don't have to... Now you should extra call him.

1344
01:32:31,151 --> 01:32:32,532
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well I'm closing the Skype line.

1345
01:32:35,935 --> 01:32:37,256
[SPEAKER_03]: They're intimidated by you, I swear.

1346
01:32:40,579 --> 01:32:41,660
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not intimidated by you.

1347
01:32:44,752 --> 01:32:46,913
[SPEAKER_07]: When I roll into the OLR, like, what?

1348
01:32:48,594 --> 01:32:49,334
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1349
01:32:50,255 --> 01:32:54,217
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I guess since that's it, that's pretty much the show.

1350
01:32:54,437 --> 01:33:01,661
[SPEAKER_03]: So, how about... And I'm not going to do a fortune cookie tonight either, so... No fortune cookie?

1351
01:33:01,861 --> 01:33:02,241
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1352
01:33:03,261 --> 01:33:04,802
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's a derp-isode and I don't care.

1353
01:33:04,822 --> 01:33:08,264
[SPEAKER_07]: You should just play the quartet song again.

1354
01:33:12,051 --> 01:33:14,112
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I'll play the quartet song again.

1355
01:33:14,132 --> 01:33:14,572
[SPEAKER_03]: How's that sound?

1356
01:33:16,572 --> 01:33:22,494
[SPEAKER_03]: But because you have all asked for it, I will be doing about 30 minutes to an hour of pump up the volume.

1357
01:33:22,554 --> 01:33:24,555
[SPEAKER_03]: So stay tuned after the show.

1358
01:33:24,575 --> 01:33:25,515
[SPEAKER_07]: Nobody asked for that.

1359
01:33:25,635 --> 01:33:26,315
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, they did.

1360
01:33:26,415 --> 01:33:26,795
[SPEAKER_03]: Shut up.

1361
01:33:26,955 --> 01:33:28,776
[SPEAKER_07]: That's like torture on the radio.

1362
01:33:28,976 --> 01:33:29,716
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it is not.

1363
01:33:29,796 --> 01:33:31,176
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone thinks it's completely awesome.

1364
01:33:31,236 --> 01:33:34,397
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't help it if you are torture on the damn radio.

1365
01:33:36,178 --> 01:33:37,658
[SPEAKER_03]: You are punishment.

1366
01:33:37,678 --> 01:33:39,219
[SPEAKER_03]: I love you.

1367
01:33:40,925 --> 01:33:42,666
[SPEAKER_00]: Rob's back next week, just reminding everybody.

1368
01:33:44,007 --> 01:33:45,989
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you guys are excited that Rob will be back.

1369
01:33:46,229 --> 01:33:47,830
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I love having you on the show.

1370
01:33:48,090 --> 01:33:48,550
[SPEAKER_07]: It's great.

1371
01:33:48,651 --> 01:33:49,171
[SPEAKER_07]: It sucks.

1372
01:33:49,351 --> 01:33:50,992
[SPEAKER_07]: Wouldn't you guys rather have me here than Jamie?

1373
01:33:51,292 --> 01:33:53,014
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob does not suck on the air.

1374
01:33:53,174 --> 01:33:54,315
[SPEAKER_03]: He doesn't even really talk.

1375
01:33:54,635 --> 01:33:55,195
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I do.

1376
01:33:55,856 --> 01:34:01,320
[SPEAKER_07]: You have been fucking... I could totally be on the show and you guys would almost not even notice that Jamie was gone.

1377
01:34:03,281 --> 01:34:07,124
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to manage... She looks so mad she can barely talk.

1378
01:34:07,944 --> 01:34:10,226
[SPEAKER_07]: I wish I would have had a picture of the look on her face a minute ago.

1379
01:34:11,647 --> 01:34:13,087
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone has to watch the chat room.

1380
01:34:13,587 --> 01:34:22,109
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's usually me, because I'm the only one that can keep all of these rowdy people under some semblance of not kicking each other all over the place with trouts.

1381
01:34:22,869 --> 01:34:24,229
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, all the people are, like, cool.

1382
01:34:24,529 --> 01:34:24,909
[SPEAKER_07]: They are cool.

1383
01:34:24,929 --> 01:34:26,310
[SPEAKER_07]: They ain't having no problem in there.

1384
01:34:26,350 --> 01:34:27,510
[SPEAKER_07]: You're just playing Warcraft.

1385
01:34:28,630 --> 01:34:29,970
[SPEAKER_03]: I do not play Warcraft during the show, Dan.

1386
01:34:30,130 --> 01:34:31,771
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why the band is going to suck.

1387
01:34:31,791 --> 01:34:34,911
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I can stream video while you guys do the show.

1388
01:34:35,571 --> 01:34:37,772
[SPEAKER_07]: But it was really hard to play Warcraft.

1389
01:34:38,052 --> 01:34:38,532
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

1390
01:34:38,852 --> 01:34:39,032
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

1391
01:34:40,054 --> 01:34:40,577
[SPEAKER_07]: End of the show.

1392
01:34:40,717 --> 01:34:41,320
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye everybody.

1393
01:34:42,345 --> 01:34:42,928
[SPEAKER_07]: Good night.

1394
01:34:43,089 --> 01:34:43,671
[SPEAKER_07]: Stay black.

1395
01:34:44,853 --> 01:34:47,575
[SPEAKER_05]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1396
01:35:16,026 --> 01:35:16,791
Thanks for watching!
