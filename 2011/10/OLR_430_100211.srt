1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,720
More lies, more lies, more lies, this will be edited out later.

2
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:21,720
Lies.

3
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:36,940
And the last of the game is a new section to the PSN Terms of Service.

4
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:37,940
Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:38,940
Hello, welcome to episode 430 of Orange Lounge Radio.

6
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,320
We are awesome.

7
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,520
And Rob's not here.

8
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:48,980
No, actually we are the show that tells gamers what they really want to know.

9
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:50,280
And I am your host for tonight.

10
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,320
I am DarkSakura and with us is Loki.

11
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,520
Hi.

12
00:00:54,520 --> 00:01:01,920
And our special guest tonight is some dude that I picked up on the internet, Dan.

13
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,920
I'm a hobo.

14
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:03,920
Yeah.

15
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:11,480
Um, so again, it's a Sunday night, six o'clock Pacific time, and you can join us on allgames.com

16
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:15,960
and listen to us live and hang out in our chat room at allgames.com.

17
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:16,960
Why am I not allgames.com?

18
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,360
That's Bobby's chat room at Orange Lounge and pound Orange Lounge.

19
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,300
And you can also, uh, follow the chat at orangeloungeradio.com.

20
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:29,880
So yeah, it's another derpisode because Rob's not here and I'm kind of ill prepared.

21
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:35,240
So why don't we just go ahead and skip the formalities and go to how was our gaming week.

22
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:38,040
And mine, uh, I played WoW for 20 minutes a day every day.

23
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,040
That's it.

24
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,040
Loki?

25
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,040
Just 20 minutes?

26
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,040
Pretty much.

27
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,600
Except for the other night when I was doing, uh, the pet hunt.

28
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,520
How do you even play WoW for 20 minutes?

29
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,400
Uh, just go on to do dailies.

30
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,400
Wow.

31
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:57,840
Anyways, um, I played, uh, quite a few things actually this week besides the usual stuff.

32
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,920
More Grand Theft Auto, more Earth Defense Force, Insect Armageddon.

33
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:09,040
Um, I did play a few things, including some stuff I should be playing, like, um, Tiny

34
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,040
Tower.

35
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:13,880
I played a little bit of that just because I realized that there is an update to it and

36
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:20,280
I did the update and bought the two extra shops of each kind and a few extra residential

37
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:27,160
floors and, uh, added those all in there and my tower is super huge even though it technically

38
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:33,000
isn't cheating anymore because, uh, the credits and stuff aren't locked but, yeah, it's still

39
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
cheating.

40
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,040
Um, and, yeah, the game is still pointless.

41
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,840
And there's no extra achievements so there's really no reason for me to actually play it

42
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,400
but I did.

43
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:50,040
And then also on iOS I checked out Katamari Amore which is the new Katamari game for,

44
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:54,120
you know, the iPod, iPad, iPhone.

45
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,120
And it's alright.

46
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,120
I mean, once again, I don't really care too much for touch screen controls for a lot of

47
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,400
stuff, especially, you know, when it comes to virtual thumb sticks but it's alright.

48
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:10,920
It works pretty good and, um, you could check out the free version which is basically just

49
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:17,520
a time trial, um, level that's only two minutes long and if you want the rest of it you can

50
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:20,800
buy the download pack which is $3.99.

51
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,080
It's alright but, uh, definitely if you're thinking about picking it up try the demo

52
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:30,360
first and then if you like it then go ahead and, uh, you know, pay for the full thing.

53
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:35,040
Uh, and then finally the other thing I really shouldn't have been playing is a leaked game

54
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:41,560
that came out, um, it's a leaked Xbox Live arcade game called Saints Row Money Shot.

55
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:46,060
Now I'm not sure if this is actually a game that got cancelled or if it's a game that's

56
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,060
coming out.

57
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:51,560
I mean, it's possible it may be coming slightly before the launch of the game because there

58
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:57,200
are some, uh, unlocks for Saints Row the Third in the game itself.

59
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:02,600
You can unlock the hover bike and this, uh, sniper outfit and one of the sniper rifles.

60
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:08,040
Uh, but basically the whole game's premise is very similar to, like, the movie Wanted

61
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:14,120
or at least a section of it where you're firing the sniper rifle, um, and actually controlling

62
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:20,400
the trajectory of the bullet as you're, you know, flying to your intended target.

63
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:25,080
And so you can hit different things that will interact with the environment, um, like you'll

64
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:30,720
have different goals like, you know, kill three pigeons, um, you know, get a bunch of

65
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,520
close calls and that kind of thing and you unlock different bullets that have, you know,

66
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,120
uh, more speed, more, uh, turning ability, that kind of stuff.

67
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:44,380
But I mean, seriously, when they're moving faster, it's a lot harder to actually play

68
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,380
the game.

69
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:50,080
But, um, some of the cool stuff you can do, you know, there's one part where you hit a

70
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,160
wine bottle of this couple that's, you know, sitting there having a nice dinner in their,

71
00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:00,600
you know, condo or apartment and that unfortunately causes the bottle to shatter and hit the candle

72
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:05,720
that's on the table and they both catch it on fire, or another one where it knocks out

73
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:12,360
the cane of an old woman and there's implied, you know, oral sex there and funny stuff like

74
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,360
that.

75
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,600
But, uh, you know, kind of the Saints Row over the top humor to go along with it.

76
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,400
Rated E for Everyone.

77
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,400
Of course.

78
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:25,960
Um, so it may be something that's still coming, um, it's definitely not the, uh, Saints Row

79
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:30,080
drive-by game that was supposed to become an Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network.

80
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,000
That was gonna be kind of like its own thing and that was the one that was supposed to

81
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,280
come to the 3DS.

82
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:43,520
Uh, but this game may very well come to Xbox Live Arcade, um, I would imagine this month

83
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,480
if it's gonna come at all, um, I don't know.

84
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,480
It was alright.

85
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:52,760
It was a little bit boring because there's only really three story levels.

86
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:58,240
The rest are kind of practice training levels, but then again, this isn't really a finished

87
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,240
build of the game.

88
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,760
It's something that came out back in June, but I don't know.

89
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,760
It'll be cool.

90
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:07,560
I definitely would want to check out the full version if it did come out just at the very

91
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,760
least for the unlocks.

92
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:13,440
Um, and that's pretty much it.

93
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,440
That's all I've been playing.

94
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,040
Well, sweetie?

95
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,040
Yes.

96
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:23,000
What have you been playing?

97
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,560
I played some Tetris DS.

98
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,560
Woo!

99
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,720
You've been watching a lot of videos.

100
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:33,320
Yeah, I spent a little time in the vault last week and, uh, played some Genesis stuff.

101
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,320
Besides that, nothing really current.

102
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:38,320
No, but you have been watching a lot of videos.

103
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,320
I watched a couple.

104
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:43,280
I watched a playthrough of Sapphire today, now it's kind of a cool game.

105
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,280
I love that game.

106
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,280
You didn't even know what it was.

107
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,280
What's this?

108
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,440
Well, no, I just walked in and it looked like a tank game for a minute and I was like, wait,

109
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,440
that's not a tank game.

110
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,440
It doesn't look like a tank game at all.

111
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,120
This is a big skull and I forgot that level, so shut up.

112
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,120
You know, you know what?

113
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,120
Here we're talking about.

114
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,120
Okay, you're fired.

115
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,120
Ah.

116
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,120
Everyone, Dan's kicked off the show.

117
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,120
Damn it.

118
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,120
Okay, you're rehired.

119
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,120
If you go get me something to drink.

120
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,120
No.

121
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,400
Okay, you're fired again.

122
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:15,120
So anyway, a little bit of housekeeping.

123
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,120
Basically, Rob's at Disneyland and we're all super jealous.

124
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,120
Well, at least I am.

125
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,560
Dan, are you super jealous?

126
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,400
I really want to see Space Mountain Ghost Galaxy.

127
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:32,120
Well, if all plans out, we're going, but not now.

128
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,120
Maybe.

129
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,120
Maybe.

130
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:41,080
So anyway, let's go ahead and move on from, let's move past Rob's absence and I'm over

131
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,080
it.

132
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,080
I'm over it.

133
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,520
I was a little upset for a while, but now I'm over it.

134
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,840
So how about we launch into the first story?

135
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:52,840
Sure, let's talk about the new Xbox 360 dashboard that's going to be coming out later this year.

136
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,800
Of course, it's assumed to be coming out sometime in the fall.

137
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:02,000
That's usually when their fall dashboards come out and yes, it's actually been leaked

138
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,920
according to an internal memo from PayPal, which is going to be part of the new dashboard.

139
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:11,040
They're going to be adding PayPal payments.

140
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:18,040
It's listed the release of this as November 15th and of course the dashboard update kind

141
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:22,840
of refreshes the whole look of it, kind of gives it the Windows phone, Windows 8 kind

142
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:26,960
of looked to the whole thing, which I kind of hate, but whatever.

143
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:34,240
But yeah, it's right now, November 15th is kind of the target date.

144
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,760
I mean, it's not a big surprise.

145
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:42,320
It's usually around between the end of October to the second week of November.

146
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:47,620
In fact, I think last year is about the same time anyways.

147
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:48,620
So we have that.

148
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:56,120
Of course, some more information regarding the supposed Xbox TV service they're going

149
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:00,760
to be having, some of the content providers that they're going to be featuring on this

150
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:05,720
according to Bloomberg, Comcast, Verizon.

151
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:16,280
They're also expecting the HBO, Crackle, Bravo, Syfy, LoveFilm and a lot more.

152
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:20,480
I guess also some stuff from Amazon as well.

153
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,480
So it looks like they're going to be trying to source content from, now I think not only

154
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:31,440
just cable providers, but actual cable content providers on top of just actually the cable

155
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,440
companies.

156
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:39,400
So maybe, for example, if you don't have cable, you may not be just locked out of all this,

157
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:45,140
which would be nice because I would prefer not to have cable, but getting a somewhat

158
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:50,920
okay deal right now, but in a year's time that may change and it'd be nice to have some

159
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:55,380
extra sources of content other than the internet.

160
00:09:55,380 --> 00:10:00,520
And of course, I'll probably get a nice little peek of this pretty soon considering that

161
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:08,360
the dev kit dashboard update that's the preview for this fall thing also leaked to the internet

162
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:16,440
and been taken down pretty quickly, but it happened to snag a copy for my dev kit before

163
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:20,160
I did get taken down, so I will get a chance to check that out.

164
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:25,200
Although based on the YouTube videos I've seen, it's still rather boring because it's

165
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,560
basically what you see in the screenshots.

166
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,240
Because it's an Xbox menu.

167
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:35,840
Well, it's like I don't understand with each update, they kind of make it worse.

168
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,040
Bring back the blades, dammit.

169
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:41,040
I mean, that's what I use pretty much now anyways, it's just the blades.

170
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,280
Just hit the guide button, blades come up, and I'm hoping that's still the case with

171
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:49,640
this because I just really don't care for the new update.

172
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:53,340
And I understand why they're doing it, it's because they can say, hey, look at all this

173
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,640
ad space we've got.

174
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,960
We can advertise games, we can advertise services, we can have third party ads.

175
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:04,200
I mean, that's really what it's come down to and that's kind of scary if you think about

176
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,880
it because they're gonna do the same thing with Windows 8.

177
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,880
Thankfully with Windows 8 you can turn that off, kind of like you can turn off Media Center,

178
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,280
but I don't know.

179
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:17,760
I wish it was optional like Media Center.

180
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,640
I would think by now we have the technology to where we can customize the way that the

181
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,640
dashboard looks.

182
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,440
If I want the Windows 8 look, cool, I can do that.

183
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,380
If I want the old one, cool, I should be able to do that as well.

184
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:31,960
You know what I like about the updates to the dashboard, and it's not really even specific

185
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:36,060
to the dashboard but just part of the whole update package, I like the fact that they

186
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:39,060
stopped making the avatars look retarded.

187
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:42,360
They like re-proportioned them a little bit so their heads aren't all stupidly huge and

188
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:46,240
they look a little bit more like people but they still look like avatars.

189
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,520
That's awesome.

190
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,720
The Miis still look like bobbleheads.

191
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,720
Yeah, but Miis...

192
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,720
They're supposed to look like bobbleheads.

193
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,220
Miis always sucked.

194
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:56,160
The Xbox ones, I thought, weren't supposed to have that bobbleheaded look so I like it

195
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,160
too.

196
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,160
Right.

197
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,680
The avatars are like kind of neat but the Miis, yeah, were always just sort of creepy

198
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,680
looking.

199
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,680
Yeah.

200
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,680
Yeah.

201
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:09,040
So, I don't know, we'll just...

202
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:13,860
It's only, what, a month away so, I mean, whatever.

203
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:18,640
I'm just glad I'm not participating in the fall preview because I fucking hated that.

204
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:22,560
It's just like, oh hey look, we're pushing another dashboard update to you.

205
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,560
Every day.

206
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,560
Twice a day.

207
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:29,920
It's like, ugh, I have to sit here for another ten minutes while this shit downloads.

208
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,920
It wasn't worth it.

209
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:34,740
And I didn't even get anything free out of it like the people that tested, was it the

210
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:42,680
last dashboard thing with the XGT3 stuff where you got a free copy of Reach.

211
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,680
That didn't even work.

212
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,680
Well, at least when they updated it.

213
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,680
Well, you still get a games on demand version so it's...

214
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,680
Sweet.

215
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,680
Yeah, it's not too bad.

216
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:55,320
If you don't like hard drive space, it's great.

217
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,880
My turn?

218
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,880
Yes.

219
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:58,880
Okay.

220
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,440
Hey, guess what?

221
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:03,800
Microsoft's coming out with a new Windows phone that nobody's gonna buy.

222
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,800
Who's surprised?

223
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:09,840
It has swappable controller pads so you can have a keyboard, a touch screen, an extended

224
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,100
battery or a game controller.

225
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:16,960
The problem is, it's a Windows phone and everybody hates Windows phones.

226
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,640
Totally hate Windows phones.

227
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,640
Microsoft doesn't hate Windows phones.

228
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:25,900
I mean, after all, they're redesigning Windows to look like they're Windows phones.

229
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,720
They're just redesigning Windows to work on tablets.

230
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,200
That's the future for Microsoft.

231
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,200
They wanna...

232
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,200
They wanna get into the tablet business.

233
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,200
Well, and you can turn it off.

234
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,200
The phone business would be...

235
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,200
What, the phone?

236
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,200
No, with the PC version.

237
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,440
Turn what off?

238
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:41,520
You can turn off that tablet interface and go back to a classic interface on Windows

239
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,520
8.

240
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,520
Yeah, I understand that, but the damages are even done as far as I know.

241
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:47,520
You mean you can make Windows look like Windows?

242
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,800
Score!

243
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:56,760
I'm really sad that they took out the support to make Windows look like Windows 3.1.

244
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,040
You can make Windows look like old Windows?

245
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,040
Score!

246
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,040
Really?

247
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,280
I am so ready for Windows to be radically different.

248
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,720
I mean, it's fine.

249
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,960
Windows is Windows and you're used to Windows being what it is, but it is sort of like,

250
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:14,120
man, I sure would like to see Windows do something different.

251
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,600
I don't really think Windows now.

252
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:23,840
There's not anything I've done and said, you know, I really wish Windows 7 did this.

253
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,520
I'm fine with Windows 7.

254
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,120
Windows 7 does everything I need to do.

255
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:32,140
I don't need to interact with social networks any more than I already am.

256
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:34,960
I don't need them to post an update.

257
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,560
Matt just opened calculator.

258
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,560
Yeah.

259
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,880
No one fucking cares.

260
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,180
You know what's going to happen is they're going to get this whole thing with perfect

261
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:46,480
social network integration and right then the whole world's going to be like, eh, we're

262
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,160
done with social networks.

263
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,720
Let's move on to something else that's lame.

264
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,720
You know what?

265
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,620
Your article, that top attachment, I swear, looked like a Wiimote.

266
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:58,760
That's right.

267
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:01,160
It's the new Wii Microsoft phone.

268
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:04,720
Mic, Wii, I got nothing.

269
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,720
Micro Wii.

270
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,720
Nice.

271
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,720
Yeah.

272
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,720
Well, I don't know.

273
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:13,920
That kind of goes with what our friend used to call Microsoft, microflacid.

274
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:20,720
Anyway, how about some news that makes everybody happy because it has to do with portal.

275
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:25,920
There is new download content for portal 2, which is called Peer Review, and it is a free

276
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:32,240
download for PC, PS3, and Xbox 360, available on October 4th.

277
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:39,320
It has more of the co-op modes for Atlas and Peabody, who are the cutie little robots that

278
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:43,160
like to hug so much, and hey, this article has my desktop wallpaper on it.

279
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:47,500
GLaDOS will be there, so that's going to be cool, and there's also a challenge mode for

280
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:53,920
co-op and single player that has leaderboard support, and if you want some more free stuff,

281
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:59,680
the third and fourth group of tracks from the portal 2 soundtrack, Music to Test by,

282
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,460
is on Valve's site right now, which I need to download them.

283
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:08,280
Probably some more ringtones and message sounds, I bet.

284
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,280
Cool.

285
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:14,640
I actually have the Turret Symphony as one of my ringtones.

286
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:19,240
The little one that you hear, the four little turrets practicing in the little level.

287
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,000
You must be so proud.

288
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I am!

289
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Shut up!

290
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I'm not proud of your face.

291
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,600
Wah wah.

292
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,600
Okay.

293
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,360
Well that's it for that one.

294
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:35,960
Well, this is a little bit interesting, and a little bit disappointing, because I kind

295
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:40,720
of, I read this, and you know, I was craving Subway anyways because I had a coupon for

296
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,320
it, and although it wasn't before the store went to.

297
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,800
Yeah, why do you need a coupon for Subway?

298
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,800
It's all $5 anyway.

299
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:49,760
Well yeah, I understand that, but you know, I wasn't gonna actually use it right now,

300
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:54,880
and it was for like, you know, get a bunch of like, footlongs for free and that kind

301
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,880
of stuff.

302
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,880
Multiple sandwiches.

303
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,880
That's a pretty good coupon.

304
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:02,800
Um, but, so I went down to Subway because they've got this thing going on right now

305
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:09,840
with Uncharted 3, where if you go down to Subway, you can actually get a code to play

306
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:16,400
in the, I guess the multiplayer beta or multiplayer portion of Uncharted 3 throughout the month

307
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,400
of October.

308
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,400
Dude, I saw that!

309
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,400
I should have got a drink.

310
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:26,680
Yeah, it's a 30 ounce drink, and basically, not only do you get a PlayStation Network

311
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:32,600
code for that, to play the multiplayer portion of the game, but you also get an exclusive

312
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:40,760
item which earns you the ability to do the Subway footlong taunt, you know, the $5 footlong

313
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,240
thing that they do in the commercials.

314
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,240
Nice.

315
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:48,560
So you have that taunt as well, that you can earn from getting a drink.

316
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:52,640
And here I was all ready to get a drink, in fact...

317
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,640
You even got a drink!

318
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:57,760
Yeah, well no, to go back to what I was talking about earlier before the show started, how

319
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:02,920
the person at Subway was really stupid, I asked for a large drink, and she rang me up

320
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:06,640
for a small drink, because she is stupid.

321
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,740
Did you reach her across the counter and pimp-slap her?

322
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:12,760
I should have, but once again though, I looked at their cups, and their cups did not have

323
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,200
the new stuff on them.

324
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:21,760
I'm sure that participation will vary by location based on whether they're phasing out their

325
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,440
old inventory or not, so...

326
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,760
You know, often those promotions are even no purchase required, you can probably just

327
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,880
ask for a code and they have to give it to you.

328
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:34,880
Maybe, but I'm sure that this woman would have not known what the hell I was talking

329
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,880
about.

330
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,520
Should have been like, footlongs are $5!

331
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,520
Woo!

332
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,520
Exactly.

333
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,520
Yay!

334
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,520
Footlongs $5, yay!

335
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:46,840
And they're probably trying to get you really psyched up about the online portion of Uncharted

336
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:50,560
3, because the online portion will require a Playstation Network pass.

337
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:55,840
Yes, Sony has of course jumped on board with the whole online pass thing, starting with

338
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:01,440
Resistance 3, and of course, unsurprisingly, continuing on with Uncharted 3.

339
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:08,240
And it's a one-time use code that will require all players to enter it in, in order to play

340
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,200
the online portion of Uncharted 3.

341
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:17,240
Although, if you're like me, you probably couldn't give two shits about the online portion

342
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,480
of Uncharted 3.

343
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:23,480
So I don't know.

344
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:27,400
But yeah, if you buy the game used, you're gonna have to pay $10 if someone's already

345
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,680
activated the code.

346
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:35,440
And of course, this is to combat piracy, but really it's just, you know, make a little

347
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,080
money on the back end from used copies.

348
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:43,480
It's what you call a shameless cash grab, and a way to put the screws into GameStop,

349
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:46,080
and which I'm kind of down with, because fuck GameStop!

350
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,800
No, I don't have any problem with GameStop, really.

351
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,800
I have a problem with GameStop.

352
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,440
Yeah, me too.

353
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,680
Hey, you like movies?

354
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,680
No.

355
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,680
Yes.

356
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,680
You like zombies?

357
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,680
Yes.

358
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,680
You like movies about zombies?

359
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,680
Yes.

360
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,080
You like movies based on video games?

361
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,200
What?

362
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,880
Looks like Dead Island might already be getting a movie.

363
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,040
People are already looking at it.

364
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:15,400
Looks like Lionsgate and producer Sean Daniel, who apparently was responsible for Tombstone

365
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:22,240
and Dazed and Confused, two very decent movies, is thinking, hey, this looks like it'd be

366
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:27,480
a great movie, but seriously, all zombie movies are the goddamn same anyway, except for, you

367
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:30,200
know, Shaun of the Dead, which was hilarious.

368
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,680
So guess what?

369
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,680
I like Wild Zero.

370
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,680
Good.

371
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,680
Which I still have your copy.

372
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,680
Great.

373
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,680
Huh?

374
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,680
Nothing.

375
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,680
Wild Zero?

376
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,680
Yeah.

377
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,680
If you like zombie movies, there's more coming.

378
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:45,840
If you like Dead Island, watch the big screen.

379
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:51,080
And I mean, they're trying to make it an emotional zombie movie, so they're basing it off a trailer,

380
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:55,320
which, which is great because the trailer had nothing to do with the actual game.

381
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:59,320
Aren't zombie movies always pretty emotional?

382
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,720
Zombies are into the pursuit of brains.

383
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,920
That's heartfelt right there.

384
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,440
They're like, I feel for their play.

385
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,680
And people run in fear with great passion.

386
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,680
People?

387
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,960
There's people in these movies?

388
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,760
Yeah, the people that end up being food.

389
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,440
I thought those people were just food.

390
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,720
And you know, what's kind of annoying though is all these zombie movies nowadays, especially

391
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,640
starting after, what was it, 28 days.

392
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:24,880
Yeah, they all have the smart killer zombies.

393
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,880
Like the ones that run.

394
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,880
I mean, come on.

395
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,360
They don't have the shuffling undead because the shuffling undead aren't interesting anymore.

396
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:33,800
But the funny thing about zombie movies was it was always just about the fact that they

397
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,200
were slow but unstoppable.

398
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,680
Now they're all fast and unstoppable.

399
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,800
And they're fast and unstoppable and they think.

400
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,860
Which you know what that really makes them?

401
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:45,960
Not fucking zombies.

402
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,080
Really guys.

403
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:51,400
I want them to do a zombie movie where the people aren't zombies but all the animals

404
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,400
are.

405
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,520
You know what would be great?

406
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,520
Like zombie cows.

407
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,520
They did a movie about Resident Evil.

408
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:59,000
Yeah, well kind of like Pet Sematary, yeah, but they're all like church and the people

409
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
don't come back.

410
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,780
But they're attacking all the people.

411
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:03,780
Zombie animals.

412
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,520
But would they turn the people into zombies?

413
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,480
No, they just eat them.

414
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,480
I'd watch that.

415
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,000
That'd be a good movie.

416
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,160
Copyright Dark Sakura 2011 blah blah blah blah.

417
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,600
That movie sounds really stupid.

418
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,600
So do you.

419
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,600
Okay, next story.

420
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,600
You got me there.

421
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,600
I love you.

422
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,760
You mean it.

423
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,760
Next story.

424
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,760
How about Nintendo Power?

425
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,320
Who of us grew up with Nintendo Power?

426
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,320
All of us.

427
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,320
Get the power.

428
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,320
Nintendo Power.

429
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,040
I was published in Nintendo Power once.

430
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,040
What?

431
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,040
You're lying.

432
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,040
I'm not lying.

433
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,040
Prove it.

434
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:39,120
I'll have to find the issue but it was the one doing the immortality thing for Mega Man

435
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,120
3.

436
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:45,240
Well I happen to know a guy who has almost every issue of Nintendo Power so we're gonna

437
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,240
find out.

438
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,240
Okay.

439
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,240
Fine.

440
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,240
So anyway.

441
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,140
They are being distributed.

442
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:59,380
It's distributed in the US by the same people that do Playstation, the official Xbox magazine,

443
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:01,160
and of course there's Nintendo Power.

444
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:04,680
They do Best Spies at Gamer and PC Gamer.

445
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:14,240
And they're actually saying that since people are, you know, first of all, poor, broke,

446
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,240
you can't see the magazine very well at the newsstand, I mean it's really not getting

447
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:23,520
a big order, and the digital revenues are where the money is, that basically they're

448
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:29,040
thinking about changing how they do Nintendo Power in the US.

449
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:34,200
They are thinking about doing it digital only instead of doing it in print, but then again

450
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:39,640
as someone pointed out earlier in chat, EGM went away and they came back.

451
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,080
So nice.

452
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:49,440
In my world, when Nintendo quit publishing Nintendo Power, it quit being Nintendo Power.

453
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,440
It just did.

454
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,120
It was the end of an era then.

455
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:58,060
Now if it goes away, it's just another magazine going away, but when Nintendo published it,

456
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:00,520
it was the official Nintendo propaganda magazine.

457
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,800
That would be like Napster going away now.

458
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,680
It's like, who cares.

459
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:08,440
In fact, when he said Napster, I'm like, is Napster still around?

460
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,440
Yeah it is.

461
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,040
It's a legit music service now.

462
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,040
No one cared.

463
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,560
When they're like, we're going legit, everyone's like, we're going elsewhere.

464
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,560
Exactly.

465
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:20,880
I was like, wait a minute, I can't steal music for free?

466
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,880
Fuck this.

467
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,880
I'm out.

468
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:28,480
Well according to Gamasutra, Future is going to be doing their update for their plan starting

469
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:36,160
on I believe, they're going to show what the plan is for November 24th and later, through

470
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,160
2012.

471
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,760
If anyone cares.

472
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,760
Some people care.

473
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,760
Damn it.

474
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,760
I care.

475
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,760
A little.

476
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,760
Next.

477
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:48,920
Well cool, let's talk a little bit about what's coming out soon.

478
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,920
Starting with October.

479
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,920
In the U.S.

480
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:51,920
Oh wait, isn't this our music?

481
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,480
No, we don't have music for this section of the show.

482
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,920
Well, I did it anyway.

483
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:56,920
We have music.

484
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,560
Okay, so what's coming out?

485
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,920
I refuse to have music.

486
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,920
Fine.

487
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,920
Anyways.

488
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:10,040
Today, actually, Tetris Axis came out on Nintendo 3DS, and it was great.

489
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:14,800
Earlier this week, Kotaku had actually run a little bit of a, they do this stupid video

490
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:19,640
blogging crap for some of the games that they get to test and stuff, like, ooh look, we

491
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,640
got the test.

492
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:26,280
And they were showing off the augmented reality portions of Tetris Axis, and man, that looks

493
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,660
retarded.

494
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:33,240
I'm so glad that I'm not a big Tetris fan, because it's just like, hey, look, I gotta

495
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:37,600
put a card down on a table and I gotta walk around the table while I play Tetris.

496
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,600
What's the point to that?

497
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,440
I mean, seriously.

498
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:43,360
So that's coming out this week on the 3DS.

499
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:48,240
On Xbox 360, Motion Explosion by Majesco.

500
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,320
It's just a weird mini-game collection for the Kinect.

501
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,160
What do you expect?

502
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:56,840
Dark Souls on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

503
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:59,040
Yes, I tend to rhyme sometimes.

504
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:02,520
Sometimes you're clever.

505
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:08,480
Gunslingers coming out on the Wii, and this is kind of an on-rails, western shooter game.

506
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:17,840
NBA 2K12 coming out on PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, and PSP.

507
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:23,200
Rage coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.

508
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:28,620
Age of Enigma, The Secret of the Sixth Ghost on PC.

509
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,280
No idea what that is.

510
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:37,680
Spider-Man Edge of Time on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, 3DS, and NDS.

511
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:42,640
And hopefully it's not as terrible as X-Men Destiny, because that game has gotten some

512
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,120
pretty terrible reviews.

513
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:47,400
That game got murdered in the reviews.

514
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:51,680
Oh yeah, it's really nice that you put this unfinished game out.

515
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,680
You know what's sad about that game, too?

516
00:26:53,680 --> 00:27:00,840
It's made by Silicon Knights, who at one time was a really decent publisher, and now they're

517
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:05,240
just bootsy.

518
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:08,440
Girls Only coming out on Nintendo DS.

519
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,080
It is for girls only.

520
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:14,920
They will shoot you on sight if you try to buy that and you're not a girl.

521
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,560
I was hoping it would be like Boobalicious or something.

522
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,960
No, it's not that good, I'm sorry.

523
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:24,920
It's just some crappy girl-targeted game.

524
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:27,680
How to knit and shop.

525
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,040
Umm, yeah.

526
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,040
And makeup.

527
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:34,400
Face Raiders Photo Finish 3DS.

528
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:38,840
It's an awesome kart racing game where you can take a picture and put your face on the

529
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:44,960
kart or the person driving the kart, because everybody really wants to do that in a stupid

530
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:45,960
kart racing game.

531
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:49,560
You know you can do that on the arcade version of Mario Kart?

532
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,160
Really unaware of that.

533
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,160
Yes.

534
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,160
I'm so unaware of that.

535
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:57,280
Glad I have no memory of doing that at my bachelor party.

536
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:01,280
Oh, good.

537
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,680
That wasn't your face.

538
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:10,200
Sid Meier's Civilization V Game of the Year Edition on PC, and they made me drive as Luigi.

539
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,280
That is just a crime right there.

540
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,440
I think it was Luigi.

541
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,200
I was so messed up.

542
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:20,400
I have no memory of it until I saw the video.

543
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:26,920
Gabrielle's Ghostly Groove on the 3DS, it's a rhythm music game.

544
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:31,520
And then finally, one week from today, Just Dance 3 coming out on Xbox 360, and Wii, PlayStation

545
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:37,240
3, who the hell knows when that's coming out because it's been delayed.

546
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,800
That is it.

547
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:44,600
Alright, so for everyone in, I guess this is the UK, is this all of Europe?

548
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,600
This is UK.

549
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:49,360
For everyone in the UK, here's some releases this week.

550
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:55,320
Really the only one that matters, Chrono Trigger hits PSN on the 4th, Crysis for the Xbox 360

551
00:28:55,320 --> 00:29:03,960
and the PlayStation 3, NBA Jam on Fire Edition, which is a download, Orcs Must Die, I gotta

552
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,360
believe that's a download, I'm not really sure.

553
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,080
I think all those are downloads so far.

554
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:12,200
Payday of the High, Sega Bass Fishing, Space Channel 5 Part 2, all that crap comes out

555
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,340
on the 5th.

556
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:16,040
It's like, really?

557
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:23,340
Dark Souls for the 360 and PS3 on the 7th, NBA 2K12, Power Up Heroes and Rage, as well

558
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:27,520
as the Cursed Crusade, all land on the 7th as well.

559
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:31,360
I'm actually really interested to check out Crysis on 360 when that comes out, I think

560
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:37,380
that's actually next week I believe, because I played it on PC and it was pretty fun up

561
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:41,800
until the end where the game decided, hey, you know what, work, I don't want to do it.

562
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:48,640
I'm interested to see it from a technological standpoint, Crysis, you know, was a real system

563
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,640
killer.

564
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:52,320
Yeah, it was a really unoptimized piece of shit.

565
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:57,640
I can't wait to see if they manage to make it run well on the 360 and PS3, or if it's

566
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,640
going to run like Crysis.

567
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:02,680
Well, they did with Warhead, remember, they totally revamped the whole engine, it's like,

568
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:06,540
oh hey, yeah, by the way, remember that game that killed all your PCs, yeah, we finally

569
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:09,160
got around to optimizing it, now that could run in pretty much everything.

570
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:14,600
Well, that's what I'm saying, I just want to see if it will run on the 360 and what

571
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,600
not.

572
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,920
I hear that, you know, my understanding is that happens a lot, and I'll ask you about

573
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,880
this later, but I was talking to someone about GTA for the PC.

574
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,960
Oh yeah, it's a terrible, very unoptimized, I mean.

575
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:29,240
It's like, oh, it takes such a PC to run it, you know, because I saw, did you see the link

576
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:33,960
that I posted to the Vice City mod that somebody did?

577
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,680
I think I've seen those mods before.

578
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,880
I've got to play that.

579
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,260
That's going to be so good.

580
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:43,320
But anyways, so there's the releases for the UK.

581
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:46,680
I wonder what's coming out in Japan.

582
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,760
How about Child of Eden?

583
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:49,760
Coming out on the 6th.

584
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,760
How about it?

585
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:53,360
Well, this is the Xbox 360 list.

586
00:30:53,360 --> 00:31:02,360
F1 2011, Oga Mosokoku X, no sorry, Kyoku X, my bad, Rage, and the Gun Stringer.

587
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:11,960
And then moving forward to Playstation 3, we have Major League Baseball 2K11, Child

588
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:18,800
of Eden as well, and F1 2011, what, what did you say?

589
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,800
Sorry.

590
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:20,800
Oh.

591
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:29,680
God of War, Chains of Olympus, and Ghost of Sparta HD, Rage, World Soccer winning 11 2012,

592
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:34,640
Ace Combat, that's getting a little bit further past, my bad.

593
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:40,160
On the Vita, we have nothing, because it's on the list for some stupid reason.

594
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:46,840
On the PSP,.hack link, for PSP the best, it's a re-released, AKB 148, that's idled

595
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:53,800
to Guam to Koshitara, and that's going to be a bunch of limited editions too.

596
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:58,560
Okashi Nashima no Peter Pan, Sweet Neverland is also going to be out in a regular limited

597
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:02,960
edition, and Phantom Kingdom Portable will be out on the 6th, with a limited edition

598
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:03,960
as well.

599
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:12,640
Tsugi no Giseisha o Oshirase Shimasu, Kimitoko no Hateru Kotanai Kurayami O is going to

600
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,960
be out on the 6th by Booston.

601
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:21,840
And let's see what else we have on the Wii, Just Dance Wii, but that's not until next

602
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,140
week.

603
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:30,820
On the 3DS we have Super Black Bass 3D Fight, which makes fishing sound cool, I guess.

604
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:35,040
On the PS2, nothing, because no one care.

605
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:39,400
And on the DS, nothing, although Super Scribblenuts will be coming out next week, which is kind

606
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,760
of cool.

607
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:47,360
And for Japanese PC gamers, Batman Arkham City, Battlefield 3, that's about it.

608
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,360
Really?

609
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,480
There's some other stuff, but they're not giving us dates.

610
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,960
I'm surprised they're getting that so early.

611
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:52,960
No one care.

612
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,800
Arkham City is going to be awesome.

613
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,440
Just as October is at the top of the list, so I'll set it.

614
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:01,320
That's probably just sometime in October, I doubt that they're getting it that early.

615
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:04,320
No, but it gives our friends overseas something to look forward to.

616
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,400
Something you can look forward to, but when you go to the store this week, you're not

617
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,400
going to find it there.

618
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:15,160
I didn't say it was this week, I said it was this month.

619
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:22,240
This is kind of strange, they've got this game coming out for iOS called Life of George.

620
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:26,280
You might be thinking, is this some sort of documentary game based on George Washington?

621
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,280
No.

622
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:34,760
It's a Lego game, actually, where you're challenged to build different things that you see in

623
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:39,120
this photo album using actual bricks.

624
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:42,200
You buy a $30 kit from the Lego store.

625
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:45,480
You've already kind of lost me there because it's a $30 kit, and I'm assuming it comes

626
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:48,880
with like 10 pieces.

627
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:56,440
Apparently, it comes with this green screen like a building mat, and so you're challenged

628
00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:01,240
to recreate 120 different models, or build your own models and then have them scanned

629
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:04,040
into the game.

630
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:10,680
You're awarded based on accuracy and how quick you put everything together.

631
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:21,200
But really, a $30 iOS game, and I have not actually seen what this Lego kit is, but I'm

632
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:26,920
going to be willing to bet that it's probably, considering the price of Legos, which is really

633
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:35,520
ridiculous, it's probably like 20 pieces, so it wouldn't be that difficult to recreate

634
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,520
everything.

635
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:41,040
But just out of curiosity, let's see, Life of George.

636
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,240
That actually does sound kind of cool.

637
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:45,100
Because you're a Lego addict.

638
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:48,360
And at the same time, devastatingly stupid.

639
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,360
Whoa!

640
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,360
Yes.

641
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,360
I am surprised.

642
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,920
It's actually 146 pieces.

643
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:56,400
That's actually not bad for Legos.

644
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:59,360
But from that picture, they're like really basic pieces.

645
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:02,920
Well, yeah, I'd imagine.

646
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:07,920
You know, I would probably just play with the Legos separately anyway and not care.

647
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,220
So I'd just go buy Legos.

648
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:12,120
That game better be free once you buy that stupid kit.

649
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:14,120
That's all I gotta say.

650
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:17,280
No, it's $44.99.

651
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,040
That sounds to me like, was it TomTom or whatever like that?

652
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:22,840
Oh hey, you gotta buy this GPS thing, 70 bucks.

653
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:25,680
Oh, dude, we mentioned the software's another 40.

654
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,960
Yeah, we hate you.

655
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:32,320
We want your money and you are gullible, so give it to us.

656
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,320
How's that?

657
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,320
Like that?

658
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,320
Yeah.

659
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:38,640
Well, how about something, you know, you could gamble on that game or you could gamble for

660
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:39,640
reals.

661
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:40,640
Ew.

662
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,640
Full House Poker.

663
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,800
Which, I actually know people who are playing this.

664
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,640
And me, I don't like poker.

665
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:49,600
I really don't like gambling games, but oh well.

666
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:55,840
But the Texas Heat tournament is on day 119 on Xbox Live.

667
00:35:55,840 --> 00:36:04,520
And it's apparently super popular, but it's not getting a fall update, but it's not going

668
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,520
away.

669
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:09,720
They just said that they plan to refresh the Texas Heat season in the future.

670
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:12,040
So what does that mean?

671
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,580
That means that, oh, we're not gonna change anything.

672
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:19,600
We're just gonna say, oh, new tournament start, here's the same thing.

673
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,000
But it's still there if you like it.

674
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,660
At least it's not going the way of 1 versus 100.

675
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:25,660
As in, away.

676
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:29,120
1 versus 100 was, like, really, really cool.

677
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,760
Yes it was.

678
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:35,520
But I would think that 1 versus 100 versus, like, I mean, this is kind of like, you know,

679
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:40,400
the World Series of Poker almost, but on a very, very small scale.

680
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:47,160
This I can see, you know, being able to play a lot more without actual structure in a season

681
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:52,080
versus 1 versus 100, which is more of like a trivia game that's kind of, you know, host-driven

682
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,880
and it'd be a little difficult.

683
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:59,640
You know, I can see how they're able to carry it on beyond, you know, like a season.

684
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:04,040
Even the 1 versus 100 extended play, though, just the practice rounds, were fun just to

685
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:06,940
pop on there and play.

686
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:09,120
I never played them, and I'm disappointed.

687
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:14,420
I'm actually very disappointed that Bob Saget was not the host on, you know, the online

688
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:15,420
version.

689
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:16,420
Yeah.

690
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:17,960
Bob Saget's a gangster.

691
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,960
He's so cool.

692
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:24,240
I mean, you know, actually, there's been one poker game that's come out that I like, and

693
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,640
that's Poker Night at the Inventory.

694
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,040
I still have got to download that.

695
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,040
$4.

696
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:33,200
Like, I watched Jamie play, see, I don't want to pay $4 for it, though.

697
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,200
You paid $4 for it.

698
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,200
You played it on my computer, G.

699
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,200
I don't like your computer.

700
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,200
Cheapo.

701
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,000
Then put a copy of my account on your computer.

702
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,560
See, that's what I'm talking about.

703
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,560
Four fucking dollars.

704
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,560
You're so Dutch.

705
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,560
What do I look like?

706
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,560
I'm made of money.

707
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,560
You're so Dutch.

708
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,560
Whatever, Jew.

709
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:57,500
Okay, so anyway, how about you talk about something that actually matters to people

710
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:04,360
instead of just throwing out, you know, religious and ancestry-related comments.

711
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,840
What in the crap are you talking about?

712
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,840
Classic game, duh.

713
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,840
Oh, classic game.

714
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:09,840
This is music for classic games.

715
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:16,840
This music is entirely too happy for classic games.

716
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,720
So start talking about it.

717
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,520
Is this really the music for classic games?

718
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,720
It's the intro music, dumbass.

719
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:27,480
I need something cool like the black hole music from one of the Advance Wars games.

720
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,480
That'd be amazing.

721
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,480
How about this?

722
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,480
All right.

723
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,480
Anyways.

724
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,480
Pause that for a second.

725
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,840
I've got to play it in the background.

726
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:39,280
Anyways, before we get into this whole classic game of the week thing, you know, I want to

727
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,840
just throw this out there.

728
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:45,360
The whole reason Jamie's been doing this thing for years is because it was stolen from me.

729
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,240
I know everything about classic games.

730
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,240
La, la, la, la, la, la, la.

731
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,240
So just shut up.

732
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,240
I'm going to unplug your mic.

733
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,240
No, you're not.

734
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,240
I know everything about classic games.

735
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,240
I am the boss.

736
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,360
And everybody knows this, right?

737
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,920
I'm the master of the vault.

738
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:59,800
I'm the one who keeps and maintains the collection.

739
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:04,160
When Jamie comes to give you guys classic games, you know who she asks for them?

740
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,160
Me.

741
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:08,840
So anyways, if you like classic game of the week, thank you.

742
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:14,120
I appreciate your work and I appreciate Jamie's work in bringing you so many classic games.

743
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,600
Dance is not getting late tonight.

744
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,600
Whatever.

745
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,840
I was going to get late anyway.

746
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:21,840
You can flip me the bird for like an hour if you really, really want to.

747
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:22,840
But anyways.

748
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:23,840
Okay.

749
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:24,840
Can I play the music again?

750
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:25,840
Start the music.

751
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:26,840
Shut up.

752
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:30,840
Still without the damn game.

753
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:34,840
So anyone who recognizes this music is automatically awesome because this is the first level theme

754
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,380
from Thunder Force 3.

755
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:37,380
Thank you, Zeta.

756
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:38,380
You win a cookie.

757
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:43,240
Thunder Force 3 is one of the absolute best side scrolling shooters on the Genesis.

758
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,840
I bought it when it first came out.

759
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:48,040
It came out in 1990.

760
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:50,880
We don't get an exact date because Wikipedia sucks rocks.

761
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,320
It came out in 1990.

762
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:57,420
I know one of the first nights it was out, I went over to software, etc. and bought it.

763
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:01,920
Took it home and proceeded to have it blow my mind for like months on end.

764
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,360
It was one of the first games to have line scrolling.

765
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,280
It had selectable levels.

766
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:09,560
It just made Thunder Force 2 look like a pile of crap.

767
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,280
It was really that much better.

768
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:16,840
In fact, Thunder Force 3 for the Genesis was so good that they took it and they made an

769
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:19,640
arcade version out of the Genesis game.

770
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:23,160
And then when they put it on SNES, they ported the arcade version.

771
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:26,520
And it still wasn't as good, although it is a damn good SNES game.

772
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:29,920
Nothing beats the original Genesis version.

773
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:35,000
The basic idea is that this giant computer, get this, you'll never have seen this coming,

774
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,600
has taken over the galaxy.

775
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,600
Who knows?

776
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,040
Yeah, I know.

777
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:42,920
And the irony is that humanity created the giant computer.

778
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:46,380
So if you haven't beaten the game, sorry about that, that was a big spoiler.

779
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:51,900
And so they dispatched you to go in there with your ship, one ship, and annihilate like

780
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:54,880
jillions of enemies and wipe them all out.

781
00:40:54,880 --> 00:41:00,200
The levels scroll every which way, the backgrounds move, you face ships that make the giant ship

782
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,480
in R-type look like a tinker toy.

783
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,480
Giant flowers.

784
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:06,840
Yeah, yeah, you shoot some giant flowers too.

785
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:09,400
Giant fish.

786
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,400
It's awesome.

787
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,480
It's really hard to describe how great this game is.

788
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:16,320
If you can throw down an emulator or if you have to take a Genesis, like I'm sure some

789
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:19,600
of you do, you really need to play this game.

790
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:22,700
What else should I say about it?

791
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:28,040
How about the differences between the different versions maybe?

792
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:30,420
All ports of the same game.

793
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:31,680
So they're essentially the same.

794
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,720
I guess when you go to Thunder Spirits in the arcade or Thunder Spirits on the SNES

795
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:38,860
or Thunder Force arcade, you lose the level select, they add in some levels from Thunder

796
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:42,320
Force 2, they take out some levels from Thunder Force 3.

797
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:45,140
The Genesis version is really the one to play.

798
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:48,600
But if you don't happen to own a Genesis, you suck.

799
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:52,280
If you don't happen to own a Genesis and you do have a SNES, you can go ahead and just

800
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,280
get on SNES.

801
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:57,400
Or if you have a Saturn, especially a Japanese Saturn, they released two collections called

802
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:02,160
Thunder Force Gold Pack 1 and Thunder Force Gold Pack 2 that had all the various Thunder

803
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,640
Force games on them.

804
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:07,360
I remember you trying to play this on the Nomad and yelling at it.

805
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:09,480
I beat the crap out of this game on the Nomad.

806
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,840
I know, but you were like, the bullets are small!

807
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:17,640
Well, the problem with any shooter on a handheld system is that bullets are extremely small.

808
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:23,080
And in Thunder Force, even on a full-sized screen, the backgrounds move so much that

809
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:26,560
you tend to lose the bullets and then you just have these phantom decks.

810
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:29,000
And when you die, you lose the weapon that you collected.

811
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:33,920
And it's not as big a disaster as it is in like Gradius when you die, you know, you don't

812
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:39,400
start from zero, but if you really like the Hunter or Wave weapons and you get hit and

813
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:44,280
lose them, then you have to, you know, soldier through without them until you get another

814
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,280
Wave weapon.

815
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,280
This level pisses me off.

816
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:49,600
You guys should be able to see this, because this level is totally sweet.

817
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:53,960
Well, how about if someone reminds me, I will repost it to our Tumblr.

818
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:54,960
To your thing.

819
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:57,280
I'll put it on our Tumblr.

820
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,280
You'll tumble it.

821
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:02,120
I feel like they're flying through the first level of Castlevania X.

822
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:09,640
Yeah, except for like this game came out like four years before Castlevania Dracula XX,

823
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:12,160
the Rondo of Blood.

824
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:15,520
That's pretty cool though, but yeah, I completely suck at this game by one minute.

825
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:16,520
I've tried.

826
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:20,560
It's really not that hard of, there's way, way more difficult shooters.

827
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:25,240
I can definitely one credit it, if not one life at any rate.

828
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:27,440
Well, I think our type is harder.

829
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:31,360
Oh, our type is blisteringly difficult compared to Thunder Force.

830
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:34,800
Like the first time you play Thunder Force III, you think, oh, it's fast and difficult,

831
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,400
but the weapons are awesome.

832
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:41,040
When you get a powered up ship, if you're not really lame, you know, it's hard to die.

833
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,760
Our type is just really easy to die.

834
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:44,760
Yeah.

835
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:46,440
The difference is our type is like a thinking man shooter.

836
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:51,360
It's slow and it's all about positioning the ship and, you know, handling the obstacles

837
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:52,360
correctly.

838
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:54,240
Thunder Force is much more of a twitch shooter.

839
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:57,160
Yeah, I see that.

840
00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:00,760
Well, how about some boss music before we go to break?

841
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:01,760
I don't care.

842
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:02,760
Play whatever you want.

843
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:10,040
Shoot, shoot, bang, bang, pew, pew, lasers, pew, pew.

844
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:12,920
And that is our classic game of the week.

845
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:14,440
My classic game of the week.

846
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:24,840
Thunder Force III on Genesis slash micro drive slash Genesis and the SNES and the arcade.

847
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:27,200
And you could also play it on the Saturn.

848
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,760
Yeah, all that too.

849
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:29,760
All right.

850
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:30,760
Well, guess what?

851
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:35,200
That's the end of part A and I'm going to do the ritual saving of part A now so stay

852
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,200
tuned.

853
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:37,960
I will keep you occupied with Mega Man music.

854
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:39,960
This is the part where we sacrifice a goat.

855
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:40,960
No.

856
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:43,400
Well, as long as we get to make some curry out of it later.

857
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:44,400
Take that, goat.

858
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:45,400
Okay.

859
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:48,400
Everyone, stay tuned.

860
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:57,240
And we are back from our break.

861
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:58,480
Thank you for sticking with us.

862
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:05,840
This is of course Orange Lounge Radio and as I said before at beginning of part A, Rob

863
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:06,840
is gone.

864
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:07,840
He's at Disneyland.

865
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:12,580
We locked him in the firehouse in Walt's bedroom and we've taken over.

866
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:18,640
So it is me tonight, DarkSakura, Loki, and that dude that I picked up on the internet,

867
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:19,640
Dan.

868
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:22,640
The notorious D-A-N.

869
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:23,640
What what?

870
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:24,640
What?

871
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:25,640
What?

872
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:26,640
Hearts.

873
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:27,640
What?

874
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:28,640
Hi.

875
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:29,640
Hi.

876
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:30,640
Yeah, that's Dan.

877
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:31,640
I married him.

878
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:32,640
I get to live with that.

879
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:33,640
I love you.

880
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:34,640
Anyway.

881
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:35,640
Oh, sure.

882
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:36,640
Yeah, sure.

883
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:39,280
So how about we just go ahead and get into rapid fire news?

884
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:40,280
Yes, let's.

885
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:42,280
Let's talk about some of the money stuff.

886
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:43,280
Yeah.

887
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,280
Yes.

888
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:45,280
Dance Dance Revolution is not gone.

889
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:49,800
Surprisingly, actually, they keep announcing more tracks for Dance Dance Revolution 2, a

890
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:53,760
game that's coming out on the Wii, actually in a couple weeks here.

891
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:58,840
So the fourth song reveal set here, let's go down the list.

892
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:01,760
We've got Dazzlin Darlin by HHH.

893
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:07,960
Also the Dazzlin Darlin AKBK mix, remix by DJ Command, whoever the hell that is.

894
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:13,720
Pop by DJ Taka featuring Kanako Hoshino.

895
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:17,240
Fire Fire by Stripe Gold- That's an awesome name.

896
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:18,560
Fire Fire.

897
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,280
Fire Fire.

898
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:28,520
Gold Rush by DJ Yoshitaka-G featuring Michael Alamode.

899
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:34,200
May by Amuro vs. Killer.

900
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:36,720
Second Heaven by Ryustar.

901
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:42,160
She is My Wife by Superstar Mitsuro.

902
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:45,040
Smooch by Korskay.

903
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:48,720
Vanessa by Suzaku.

904
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:55,020
And Yellow Candy by Wrist Junk and Zetta- I love the name of this one- Zetta, The World

905
00:46:55,020 --> 00:47:02,120
of Prime Numbers and Transcendental Being by Zettbach.

906
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:08,480
And I'm very surprised to see actually a lot of Japanese tracks in Dance Dance Revolution

907
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:09,480
too.

908
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:14,160
I mean, you might actually have to check that out, I mean with all the songs that they're

909
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:15,160
putting in there.

910
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:17,000
It's amazing considering it's from Japan.

911
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:21,440
But they don't always get licensed in- Not the US version, so see these games, they're

912
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:27,920
coming out, they usually tend to put a lot of licensed stuff in weird old shit.

913
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:30,200
But it's very surprising.

914
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:32,880
Also- Does it have Boom Boom Dollar?

915
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:35,080
I don't know, I haven't looked at the other ones.

916
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:38,400
If it doesn't, then fuck it.

917
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:44,200
Then of course also Dance Dance Revolution X2 Max, they've got the unlocked code, which

918
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:50,760
is unintentionally released, apparently when you name your web pages sequentially, people

919
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:54,800
are gonna figure out, hey, maybe if I change that two to a three, I'm gonna figure out

920
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,200
what the next code is.

921
00:47:56,200 --> 00:48:00,040
And that's exactly what happened.

922
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:06,880
So apparently the code unlocks the last few songs, which include Poseidon Chorus K Mix

923
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:14,080
by Niope Underground, Kiss Kiss Kiss the AKBK Mix, remixed by DJ Command, Dazzlin Darlin

924
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:20,680
the AKBK Mix, remixed by DJ Command, also from Dance Dance Revolution 2 there.

925
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:31,640
If you were here, the LED G style remix by Jennifer, Kimono Princess by Jun, looks like

926
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:42,200
Roppongi Evolved by Tag Underground, Antimatter by Orbit 1 and Milo, New Decade by Soda F,

927
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:50,960
Possession by Tag Underground, Valkyrie Dimension by Spriggan, May by Amuro vs. the Killer,

928
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:58,420
Pluto the First by Whitewall, and also the weirdly titled Zetta, The World of Prime Numbers

929
00:48:58,420 --> 00:49:04,520
and Transcendental Beans by Zetbach and Vanessa by Suzaku.

930
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:09,920
Something called Valkyrie Dimension by Spriggan actually just sounds kinda cool.

931
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:14,240
I was gonna say what, no dropout, but now I'm just wanting to see what Valkyrie Dimension

932
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:15,560
by Spriggan is.

933
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:21,120
Yeah, lots of cool songs, and of course, based on the last list we just read there, a lot

934
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:26,320
of these can be featured in Dance Dance Revolution 2, so it might be worth checking out.

935
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:30,220
And I mean, let's just put it this way, if you don't check it out right away, I can guarantee

936
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:33,880
that the game will probably price drop pretty quick anyways, and it's actually not that

937
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:39,000
expensive going into it, so you know, it might not hurt to check it out.

938
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:43,640
After all these bundles nowadays on the Wii, like the same price as a Playstation 2 DDR

939
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:49,720
game back in the day, so, you know, 50 bucks will get you a dance pad for the Wii and the

940
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:50,720
game.

941
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:55,320
Zeta pointed out that Soda Fujimori also did an awesome Gradius Chance Mix.

942
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:56,320
Yeah.

943
00:49:56,320 --> 00:50:00,000
So, just thought that was interesting.

944
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
That is interesting.

945
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:06,080
All right, and then a little bit of music news here, ReRave, you may remember that game

946
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:13,200
as a pretty awesome iOS game, rhythm music stuff, a little bit of Elite Beat Agents in

947
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:18,080
there with some other stuff, of course being put together by Step Evolution's Kyle Ward

948
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:20,880
and Chris Foy.

949
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:26,400
It is now heading to the arcades, and in fact, the original design, and you can actually

950
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:30,840
see this in the YouTube video that they first put up, actually did call for some sort of

951
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:37,360
like dance mat control type thing, not sure if that's actually going to be included with

952
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:44,200
it, but it's going to include a 42-inch multiplayer touchscreen with a global interactive ranking

953
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:50,480
network according to the press release, and it'd be interesting to see if that actually

954
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:56,440
is going to include, you know, the dance pad or whatever stage, but it is coming to arcades

955
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:57,440
rather soon.

956
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:05,620
Also, Song Pack 15 is out on iOS, including Pegasus by When Machines Dream, and also Rock

957
00:51:05,620 --> 00:51:13,240
Robotic by When Dreams Machine, or When Machines Dream, When Dreams Machine, but those are

958
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:15,640
coming out, actually you can get those right now on the iOS.

959
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:19,440
Now, 15 Song Packs, that's just ridiculous.

960
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:24,000
That's a lot more than Konami ever did on any of their Dance Dance Revolution, you know,

961
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
mixes recently.

962
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:32,240
Alas, well how about something that has nothing to do with DDR?

963
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:36,400
So remember back in 2008, Ubisoft announced that they were going to make a game called

964
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:41,160
I Am Alive, which was like a survival horror game where you're in like a city where there'd

965
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:45,760
been a giant earthquake or a tsunami or something that just obliterated it, and you're trying

966
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:52,200
to survive both against, you know, other people and, you know, a hostile environment and save

967
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:53,840
people and survive.

968
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:56,080
Yeah, that game isn't dead.

969
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:58,560
They're actually just about to release it.

970
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:00,240
It's going to come out this winter.

971
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:01,240
Really?

972
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:02,240
Really.

973
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:03,240
Wow, you don't say.

974
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:05,440
I was amazed when I saw the story.

975
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,240
I was like, really?

976
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:09,240
Isn't this like three or four years old?

977
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:12,680
I thought that it was, for some reason I remember that being like a PS1 game.

978
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:13,680
It's not even that old.

979
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:16,960
I mean, it was probably a couple of years ago, because originally it was-

980
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:17,960
It was 2008.

981
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:18,960
Really?

982
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:24,480
I thought it was 2009, because I thought that originally it was supposed to be coming out

983
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:28,680
in March, and then it got pushed back again.

984
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:30,280
But maybe that's March of last year.

985
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:33,400
I just remember that it's like every time they started talking about that game, there

986
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:37,960
was some sort of catastrophe in the world, and they were like, oh, you'd be insensitive

987
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:39,280
to release this game now.

988
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:40,280
Oh, come on.

989
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:42,000
But I guess that- let me finish.

990
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,360
But I guess that really what it comes down to is just that the developer couldn't get

991
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:50,320
the game finished, and Ubisoft was like, okay, we'll give you more time.

992
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:53,160
Okay, work on something else instead.

993
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:55,680
And just, it's been back-burnered this whole time.

994
00:52:55,680 --> 00:53:00,000
So, if you really want to play like a three and a half year old survival horror game,

995
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:04,120
because you know how great that's going to be, watch for it to be hitting shelves before

996
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:05,120
Christmas.

997
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:07,760
Actually, not shelves at all.

998
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:09,160
Oh, is it a download?

999
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:10,160
It's going to be a downloadable game.

1000
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:12,120
Download it off the internet before Christmas.

1001
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:16,080
But see, that's great though, because it's not going to be like, you know, fifty bucks

1002
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:17,080
or thirty bucks.

1003
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:18,920
It's going to be fifteen.

1004
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:20,400
I can deal with fifteen.

1005
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:21,400
Okay.

1006
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:24,360
They should just give it away at this point.

1007
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:25,360
Really?

1008
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:26,360
Yes.

1009
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:27,360
I agree.

1010
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:28,360
Free would be perfect.

1011
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:30,960
They'd probably sell a few copies.

1012
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:31,960
It might be awesome.

1013
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:33,600
You know, I'll reserve judgement on this awesomeness.

1014
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:36,000
You know what they need to do because of Ubisoft?

1015
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,520
The cause of the disaster was the Rabbids.

1016
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:39,520
Released Beyond Good and Evil 2?

1017
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:42,200
The Rabbids.

1018
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:45,080
Like you pick up a rock and it's like, AHHH!

1019
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:47,080
You're like, oh my god!

1020
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:48,080
Look out!

1021
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:49,080
It's going to kill me!

1022
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:51,000
The zombie Rabbid.

1023
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:54,080
And then they'll make a movie out of it and Ubisoft will get out of some of the financial

1024
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:55,080
trouble.

1025
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:56,080
I'm surprised.

1026
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:58,660
I thought that was actually supposed to be a series that was like a primetime comedy

1027
00:53:58,660 --> 00:54:01,040
series with the Rabbids, but they haven't done it yet.

1028
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:03,120
They're kind of, you know, a one-joke character.

1029
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:04,120
Who cares?

1030
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:08,640
There's a lot of one-joke characters that still have movie after movie after movie.

1031
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:09,640
Yeah?

1032
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:16,200
I mean, you know, if you're talking about like, well, let's see, any of the dog movies

1033
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:18,640
that they have, like Beethoven and they made 8,000-

1034
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:21,760
Yeah, yeah, that's true, because they keep making fucking penguin movies.

1035
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:22,760
Penguins, yes.

1036
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:24,960
It's like, oh dear god!

1037
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:28,360
Disclaimer, this was supposed to be rapid fire news, everybody.

1038
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:30,240
Okay, uh, shut up.

1039
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:31,240
Hey!

1040
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:32,240
You shut up.

1041
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:33,240
I'm the boss tonight.

1042
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:34,240
No you're not.

1043
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:37,400
To rapid fire onto the next news story, yeah.

1044
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:42,440
You like Rock Band, you like Limp Bizkit, oh, nobody likes Limp Bizkit.

1045
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:47,160
Well, if you want to spend ten bucks, you can get, I guess seven bucks if you want to

1046
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:51,880
do it as a package, you can get four Limp Bizkit songs in your Rock Band.

1047
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:56,200
Gold Cobra, Nookie, My Way, and Rearranged.

1048
00:54:56,200 --> 00:55:02,160
Plus, they're going to get you for an extra buck if you want pro guitar or bass.

1049
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:04,600
Goody goody gumdrops.

1050
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:12,920
And in some actually valuable news, the PS3 plays Blu-rays, plays games, it's okay, wait,

1051
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:17,760
it's going to validate its existence, because now you can get Chrono Trigger on PSN.

1052
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:19,720
There's nothing wrong with another version of Chrono Trigger.

1053
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:24,560
I can't think of one bad thing about being able to get Chrono Trigger on the PS3.

1054
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:28,160
They could charge 50 bucks for it, and it would still be worth the money.

1055
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:31,760
I ain't saying you should spend 50 bucks on Chrono Trigger, but if you did, I wouldn't

1056
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:32,760
be like, you're high!

1057
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:36,480
I'd be like, high five, Chrono Trigger kicks ass.

1058
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:38,880
We should actually play our SNES one again.

1059
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:39,880
Yes.

1060
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:40,880
Yes.

1061
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:47,520
Well, here's some news, this kind of no one cur, but Harvest Moon is going to have a partner

1062
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:49,680
with a farm.

1063
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:52,920
It's actually the Surrey Docks Farm.

1064
00:55:52,920 --> 00:56:00,160
So they're basically going to actually link the virtual environment to the real Surrey

1065
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:01,520
Docks Farm.

1066
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:08,560
So it's official, and that's coming from Gary Jones, who is the farm manager there.

1067
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:12,240
He said, we got along really well with the team, and we're very impressed with the Harvest

1068
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:16,080
Moon games, since then we stayed in touch and will be looking to work together on future

1069
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:17,080
titles.

1070
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:21,140
So they are merging real farming with virtual farming.

1071
00:56:21,140 --> 00:56:27,480
So when you go to milk your cute little cow, somebody's going to be milking a not so cute

1072
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:31,640
little, not so little, but cute cow, I guess.

1073
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:32,640
So yeah.

1074
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:33,640
Farm twinning.

1075
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:39,440
And when they run into that tainted beef, you will also get that tainted beef.

1076
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:46,560
And Frozen Synapse is a, has a new ha- is bluh bluh bluh, and you know, I would like

1077
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:49,760
to be able to speak English without going bluh.

1078
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:50,760
Bluh!

1079
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:51,760
Shut up.

1080
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:52,760
Bluh!

1081
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:53,760
Bluh!

1082
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:54,760
Bluh!

1083
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:55,760
You are not the count.

1084
00:56:55,760 --> 00:57:02,240
Frozen Synapse is going to star in a new Humble Indie Bundle.

1085
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:03,240
Yay!

1086
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:05,480
We know what the Humble Indie Bundle is, don't we, Dan?

1087
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:07,400
I have no idea what you're talking about.

1088
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:10,520
That where you pay what you want, and the money gets donated.

1089
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:12,380
I remember reading about that.

1090
00:57:12,380 --> 00:57:15,600
Didn't like the first time they did that, like 70% of the people just stole the game

1091
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:16,600
anyway?

1092
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:17,600
No.

1093
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:18,600
I don't think so.

1094
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:20,480
I think that they can pay a lot of money off of it.

1095
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:21,480
Yeah.

1096
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:24,040
And it's all, it's all gone to, you know, good causes.

1097
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:25,040
So anyway.

1098
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:32,200
Um, Frozen Synapse is going to be included in the bundle, and uh, if you pay more than

1099
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:38,880
the average price, which is more than $4.27, you also can get, um, Humble Frozen Bite Bundle,

1100
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:43,920
which actually includes, uh, Trine Shadowground, Shadowground Survivor, and the cancelled Jack

1101
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:48,720
Claw prototype, and pre-order the coming Splott.

1102
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:53,920
The money will go to Child's Play and the Electronic Frontier Foundation as you choose.

1103
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:54,920
So pretty cool, huh?

1104
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:55,920
Pretty cool.

1105
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:56,920
Pretty cool.

1106
00:57:56,920 --> 00:58:01,920
And also, uh, Frozen Synapse is, uh, included on Linux, so that's pretty neat.

1107
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:04,720
And last but never least, Persona 4!

1108
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:09,120
For all you people who like that weird game, um, there's going to be an anime version that's

1109
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:12,120
coming out in the US.

1110
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:18,840
And it is, uh, going to be, uh, released in North America and have digital distribution.

1111
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:23,440
The DVD and Blu-ray version are going to be out next year, and it premieres in Japan on

1112
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:24,440
October 6th.

1113
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:28,160
You know, I was completely unaware until I was actually doing a search for, um, I was

1114
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:33,640
looking up an item for the new Professor Layton game coming out, and the Professor Layton

1115
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:36,280
anime movie is actually coming out over here in November.

1116
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:37,280
Really?

1117
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:38,280
That's cool.

1118
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:39,280
Which is kind of interesting.

1119
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:42,040
Well, something that, uh, fans of the series should be interested in too is it's actually

1120
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:47,600
got the same art director and the composer, um, Shigenori Soijima and Shouji Meguro.

1121
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:49,160
So pretty cool.

1122
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:53,360
Have you seen that Konami has, like, a really blatant ripoff of Professor Layton?

1123
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:54,360
Yes.

1124
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:57,080
Uh, Dr. Lorick and the something or other.

1125
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:58,080
I don't remember what it was.

1126
00:58:58,080 --> 00:58:59,080
I'm going to try to find it.

1127
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:04,400
When I first saw it, I was really excited because I thought it was a, uh, a sequel to

1128
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:05,400
that doctor.

1129
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:06,400
Yeah.

1130
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:07,400
Dr. Lorick.

1131
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:08,400
Whatever.

1132
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:11,560
I thought it was a sequel to that, uh, what was it called?

1133
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:12,560
Like Henry Hatsworth?

1134
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:13,560
Yeah.

1135
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:14,560
Yeah.

1136
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:16,440
It was like a side scrolling game that, you know, I played in the store.

1137
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:18,720
The guys, everyone was playing in the store and they're just like, you got to try this

1138
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:19,720
game when I try this game.

1139
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:21,180
Your copy is sitting over there on my desk.

1140
00:59:21,180 --> 00:59:23,760
This game is fucking amazing.

1141
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:29,160
And uh, I saw that and I saw this, this professor allow track and I was like, oh my God, is

1142
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:30,160
it a sequel to that?

1143
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:31,160
No, no.

1144
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:32,160
It's a Professor Layton ripoff.

1145
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:33,320
A really obvious one too.

1146
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:36,600
Like the guy looks like if he walked up to Professor Layton, they would just be like,

1147
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:37,600
what up?

1148
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:38,600
Hey, what's going on?

1149
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:41,600
And the guy would like twirl his mustache cause he's evil.

1150
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:42,600
Okay.

1151
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:46,720
Remember when they made like cool original games?

1152
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:47,720
No.

1153
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:52,040
Didn't they make Frogger at one time?

1154
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:53,160
They made Frogger.

1155
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:55,080
They made Gradius.

1156
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:58,080
They made Castlevania.

1157
00:59:58,080 --> 00:59:59,080
What the hell?

1158
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:00,320
Okay.

1159
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:02,480
Let's do another Frogger game for the 3DS.

1160
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:04,120
Whoa, hold on.

1161
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:06,040
Why are you doing Frogger for the 3DS first?

1162
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:08,200
Gradius for the 3DS would be perfect.

1163
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:11,520
Dude, they should do Solar Assault for the 3DS.

1164
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:13,800
Solar Assault was a 3D Gradius.

1165
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:17,120
How about Why Why Konami World?

1166
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:18,120
Why?

1167
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:19,120
Why?

1168
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:20,120
Why?

1169
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:23,360
Why Why Konami's Why Why Racing?

1170
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:24,360
Ha ha ha.

1171
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:25,360
That game was awesome.

1172
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:26,360
I know.

1173
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:27,360
I don't know.

1174
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:28,360
They just...

1175
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:30,920
Oh, was that supposed to be the next story anyway?

1176
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:32,840
I think that was actually Loki's turn.

1177
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:33,840
I have no idea.

1178
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:35,240
I'm ready.

1179
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:39,240
So let's talk a little bit about Nielsen ratings.

1180
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:40,640
I don't agree with them.

1181
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:52,240
In fact, they have tapped what they call the top 10 anticipated games for 2011, for the

1182
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:54,000
fourth quarter.

1183
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,800
I'm sorry, but there's a few things missing and a few things I don't agree on.

1184
01:00:56,800 --> 01:01:00,680
So let's go down the list real quick and I can point that stuff out.

1185
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:05,280
Of course, not very obvious, I'm sure.

1186
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:07,640
Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 is number one.

1187
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:08,640
That makes sense.

1188
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:12,680
That's probably the biggest title this year.

1189
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:17,880
Number two, and actually this is the top 20 to watch for the holiday of 2011, Gears of

1190
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:18,880
War 3.

1191
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:21,760
Granted, yes, that's probably a good game.

1192
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:26,680
I'm not sure if it's a hugely anticipated game, and this is what they're guessing are

1193
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:28,920
going to be the top five titles of the year.

1194
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:34,080
Madden NFL 12, that's a no brainer, usually the number one sports game each year.

1195
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:39,360
Assassin's Creed Revelations, also kind of a no brainer, kind of expect that to do pretty

1196
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:40,360
well.

1197
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:43,680
Batman Arkham City, I can see that.

1198
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:48,560
The Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword, yeah, that makes sense.

1199
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:53,240
Battlefield 3, of course, it's going to be a pretty big title.

1200
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:57,920
Just Dance 3, yeah, on the Wii perhaps, I can see that.

1201
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:02,480
NBA 2K12, also another good franchise.

1202
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:04,440
Game for Speed the Run usually does pretty well.

1203
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:11,640
Uncharted 3, Mario and Sonic at the London 2012 Olympic Games, being that that's only

1204
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:16,520
on the Wii, I don't know, it's a pretty good third party title for them.

1205
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:19,840
Lego Harry Potter years five through seven.

1206
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:24,780
FIFA Soccer 12, The Elder Scrolls Skyrim, see that's why I understand, The Elder Scrolls

1207
01:02:24,780 --> 01:02:27,800
Skyrim is so down that list.

1208
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:30,440
That I would see doing a lot better than what they're saying.

1209
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:35,360
Dead Island did really well, I could see that maybe being a little higher up the list.

1210
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:39,320
Kinect Sports Season 2, now this is where I got to stop them.

1211
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:42,560
Yeah the first one did well, but I don't think the second one is going to sell that well

1212
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:43,940
at all.

1213
01:02:43,940 --> 01:02:49,140
Also they have Dance Central 2 on the list, yes, I would hope that the second game will

1214
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:54,720
do just as well as the first game, but I don't think that it's going to.

1215
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:58,320
Resistance 3, that's a pretty good first party title for Sony.

1216
01:02:58,320 --> 01:03:01,960
And finally, Deus Ex Human Revolution.

1217
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:04,840
Where the fuck is Saints Row the Third on this list?

1218
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:10,880
That game is going to do immensely well, but it's just sadly missing.

1219
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:15,400
Or there's like a bunch of other games that could be on this list that they're completely

1220
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:16,400
overlooking.

1221
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:19,480
No one cares about the Nilsons anyway.

1222
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:22,160
Yeah I mean, they're just guessing what's going to be in the top five.

1223
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:25,280
Nilsons don't even want to acknowledge that Saints Row the Third is going to exist.

1224
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:26,280
Let's be honest though.

1225
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:27,400
Stick to TV Nilsons.

1226
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:30,440
Where the fuck is Grand Theft Auto 5?

1227
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:32,440
It's not coming out for a while.

1228
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:34,440
Yeah I know.

1229
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:37,960
I mean I want to play Saints Row the Third because I want to play Grand Theft Auto 5.

1230
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:39,960
I just really really want to.

1231
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:43,360
Well Grand Theft Auto 5 will probably be out by about a year's time.

1232
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:48,640
I mean because they've already got their first half of 2012 already kind of spoken for.

1233
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:55,100
With Max Payne 3 and XCOM I believe are going to be the two games that, well no actually

1234
01:03:55,100 --> 01:04:00,920
XCOM is 2K but not Rockstar but Max Payne 3 I know is their spring title.

1235
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:04,720
Have you seen the trailer for Max Payne 3?

1236
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:08,320
It started off and I was really stoked because he had hair.

1237
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:13,880
And then he shaved his head and I was like god damn it Max Payne looks stupid bald.

1238
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:16,760
It just really bothers me.

1239
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:19,440
Is it just because he didn't want to render hair or something like that?

1240
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:20,440
I don't know.

1241
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:23,920
It's like when Snake was old in Metal Gear Solid 4 that just pissed me off.

1242
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:27,120
But then they made it so I could make him look young and I liked playing with him again.

1243
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:30,000
I hate it when they make my game heroes look stupid.

1244
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,840
He did have the Burt Reynolds stash.

1245
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:36,880
Oh the Burt Reynolds stash was cool.

1246
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:41,800
But yeah I mean they've got Max Payne 3 I know is coming and Agent is supposed to be

1247
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:44,140
the other thing that they're working on right now.

1248
01:04:44,140 --> 01:04:47,920
But Agent got cancelled like a long time ago.

1249
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:49,160
No it's still coming.

1250
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:51,600
Like I am alive ago.

1251
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:56,120
Yeah but L.A. Noire that was also thought to be cancelled for a long time and then eventually

1252
01:04:56,120 --> 01:04:57,280
came out.

1253
01:04:57,280 --> 01:05:00,640
Grand Theft Auto 5 I could see probably fourth quarter next year.

1254
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:04,240
Agent could make me wait for Grand Theft Auto 5 if it's good.

1255
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:07,360
I'm really excited about the possibility of Agent being good.

1256
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:09,360
L.A. Noire was awesome.

1257
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:11,360
Red Dead Redemption was awesome.

1258
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:15,480
You know if they keep bringing me other games to keep me busy I could like wait for GTA

1259
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:16,480
5.

1260
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:19,920
But it's like seriously I've been dying just to go back and replay the lost and damned.

1261
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:26,440
They don't understand how easy it is for them to in the meantime do something.

1262
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:31,680
Look at this trend that's going on right now with all these HD remakes of older games.

1263
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:38,280
Just take Grand Theft Auto 3 San Andreas San Andreas especially San Andreas.

1264
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:41,960
You know give it some HD graphics add multiplayer boom.

1265
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:43,760
Who gives a shit about Grand Theft Auto 5.

1266
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:49,040
I would pay for those two games just to be imported into the Grand Theft Auto 4 engine.

1267
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:50,040
And they've done that.

1268
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:51,440
That and that's all they would have to do.

1269
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:56,780
But I mean commercially not not as a mod but commercially if they did those games in Grand

1270
01:05:56,780 --> 01:05:59,080
Theft Auto 4 style I would die.

1271
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:01,240
But that's I would pay full price for the remake.

1272
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:06,680
I would know you have a mod team of like maybe five people that did it in a couple months.

1273
01:06:06,680 --> 01:06:11,000
What's it going to what's going to happen when you have Rockstar that has the fucking

1274
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,480
tools to make these games.

1275
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:15,540
They have all the assets to make these games.

1276
01:06:15,540 --> 01:06:18,780
How long is it going to take a team of like you know.

1277
01:06:18,780 --> 01:06:21,400
It's like printing fucking money.

1278
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:23,960
It's like making your own money for God's sakes.

1279
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:25,660
Just release them.

1280
01:06:25,660 --> 01:06:30,800
Give them to me and I will give you my money.

1281
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:32,040
It wouldn't take that much.

1282
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:34,400
And seriously they could just piggyback it on the rage engine.

1283
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:38,080
Don't have to really tweak anything just piggybacking on what it is now.

1284
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:40,040
And people would eat that shit.

1285
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:41,040
You're talking like Game of the Year.

1286
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:43,240
You're getting to the point where these games.

1287
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:47,840
I mean not that not that it's ever going to be you know irrelevant in the video game world.

1288
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:54,080
But GTA is kind of losing its relevance because Call of Duty has taken over so big and and

1289
01:06:54,080 --> 01:06:58,720
people are playing other things and you haven't heard from Grand Theft Auto which was at one

1290
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:02,360
time the dominator of the game world.

1291
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:05,540
And it's just like where is it at.

1292
01:07:05,540 --> 01:07:08,280
God damn it.

1293
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:09,280
I can't wait.

1294
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:11,660
But it's starting to piss me off.

1295
01:07:11,660 --> 01:07:15,040
See them do an HD San Andreas and it would make sense.

1296
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:17,800
It would be amazing just to do that.

1297
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:20,680
Because it's great but it's really hard for me to go backwards.

1298
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:22,480
Like I had a hard time going back.

1299
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:26,800
I mean I played through San Andreas after I played through GTA 4 while I was waiting

1300
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:31,680
for the episodes from Liberty City Pack and then I was like well screw this I'll go back

1301
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:34,640
now and I'll play Vice City and I couldn't do it.

1302
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:36,960
It's just too funky.

1303
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:41,040
You know the games the old Grand Theft Auto games were great games for their moment but

1304
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:45,240
now they just they don't look very good they don't control very good other than like using

1305
01:07:45,240 --> 01:07:49,220
cheat codes and running around and just doing messed up stuff.

1306
01:07:49,220 --> 01:07:50,220
They're not really cool.

1307
01:07:50,220 --> 01:07:54,440
But you can still go back and play like GTA 4 because GTA 4's got a really good physics

1308
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:55,440
engine.

1309
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:57,400
You know the driving controls are.

1310
01:07:57,400 --> 01:08:00,480
But you know it's just it's more fun to run around in.

1311
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:05,760
But there's just not as much shit to do as there was in San Andreas.

1312
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:06,760
GTA 5.

1313
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:08,980
It's like printing money.

1314
01:08:08,980 --> 01:08:09,980
Is it?

1315
01:08:09,980 --> 01:08:10,980
Yes.

1316
01:08:10,980 --> 01:08:11,980
Okay.

1317
01:08:11,980 --> 01:08:12,980
I believe you.

1318
01:08:12,980 --> 01:08:14,820
Sort of.

1319
01:08:14,820 --> 01:08:17,560
Is there more?

1320
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:18,560
Battlefield 3.

1321
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:19,560
That's almost like printing money.

1322
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:20,560
Huh Dan?

1323
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:21,560
Oh yeah.

1324
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:22,560
Is that my story?

1325
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:23,560
Yes.

1326
01:08:23,560 --> 01:08:24,560
Yay.

1327
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:25,560
Battlefield 3.

1328
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:26,560
Yeah.

1329
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:27,560
Speaking of printing money.

1330
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:28,560
Man.

1331
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:29,560
Everyone is losing their minds for Battlefield 3.

1332
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:33,680
Honestly I'm not even following games that close and I keep hearing about it.

1333
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:38,380
Well apparently EA in addition to just paying an ass load of money to once again take a

1334
01:08:38,380 --> 01:08:43,560
shot at knocking off Call of Duty has decided that it's going to have a Battlefield 3 worldwide

1335
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:52,000
conquest tournament in early 2012 with 1.6 million dollars in prizes.

1336
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,740
That is a lot of prizes.

1337
01:08:53,740 --> 01:08:54,880
Have you checked out the beta yet?

1338
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:56,080
It's free to download now.

1339
01:08:56,080 --> 01:08:57,960
I have not checked out the beta yet.

1340
01:08:57,960 --> 01:09:00,980
I'm not really that into FPS's.

1341
01:09:00,980 --> 01:09:02,300
It takes a very special FPS.

1342
01:09:02,300 --> 01:09:03,300
I did play.

1343
01:09:03,300 --> 01:09:04,820
Where was the last Battlefield I played?

1344
01:09:04,820 --> 01:09:06,500
Bad Company 2.

1345
01:09:06,500 --> 01:09:09,120
And I actually dug the hell out of that.

1346
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:14,820
So I always want to check out the battlefields but they never hooked me honestly.

1347
01:09:14,820 --> 01:09:18,640
I hate to admit this but I played through the first two Modern Warfares and I want to

1348
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:20,700
play through the third Modern Warfare.

1349
01:09:20,700 --> 01:09:27,300
I just don't want to pay for it because I think Activision needs to be beat to death

1350
01:09:27,300 --> 01:09:31,860
with a bag of rocks for how hard they fucked Infinity Ward.

1351
01:09:31,860 --> 01:09:34,720
So I don't know.

1352
01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:36,700
I'm caught between a rock and a hard place.

1353
01:09:36,700 --> 01:09:41,940
I'd rather give Microsoft my money by that Halo remake.

1354
01:09:41,940 --> 01:09:42,940
So we'll see what happens.

1355
01:09:42,940 --> 01:09:46,940
I'm sure I'll give my hands on it somehow.

1356
01:09:46,940 --> 01:09:48,420
Possibly.

1357
01:09:48,420 --> 01:09:49,420
We'll see.

1358
01:09:49,420 --> 01:09:54,460
Anyways, if you kick ass at Battlefield 3, enter this tournament, win some money, and

1359
01:09:54,460 --> 01:09:57,220
hook me up for nothing.

1360
01:09:57,220 --> 01:09:59,460
How about some frivolous lawsuits, huh?

1361
01:09:59,460 --> 01:10:00,740
And how?

1362
01:10:00,740 --> 01:10:08,500
Ultimate Pointer has filed patent lawsuits against Nintendo and a damn near bunch of

1363
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:15,740
everybody else for its, and I quote, easy deployable interactive direct appointing system

1364
01:10:15,740 --> 01:10:18,820
and presentation control system and calibration method therefore.

1365
01:10:18,820 --> 01:10:20,660
I call it my finger.

1366
01:10:20,660 --> 01:10:21,660
Yeah.

1367
01:10:21,660 --> 01:10:25,860
But they filed their patent in May of 2005.

1368
01:10:25,860 --> 01:10:30,580
Although it didn't receive an official status until June 2010, which is four years after

1369
01:10:30,580 --> 01:10:33,340
the Wii came out, in the US anyway.

1370
01:10:33,340 --> 01:10:37,340
And they're also suing basically everyone that works with the Wii, like anyone who's

1371
01:10:37,340 --> 01:10:40,460
done games for the Wii.

1372
01:10:40,460 --> 01:10:46,000
In fact, it's included retailers who are also involved too in making, using, importing,

1373
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:49,860
and or selling of Wii systems, games, and related accessories.

1374
01:10:49,860 --> 01:10:51,780
Also called the accused products.

1375
01:10:51,780 --> 01:10:52,780
Ooh.

1376
01:10:52,780 --> 01:10:53,780
This'll get thrown out.

1377
01:10:53,780 --> 01:10:56,400
Yeah, this is gonna get completely pissed on by.

1378
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:59,980
Big deal that you submitted your application prior, and why did it take them five years

1379
01:10:59,980 --> 01:11:05,420
is what I want to know, you know, to approve their application for their patent or whatever.

1380
01:11:05,420 --> 01:11:12,220
But regardless of that, they, they didn't get it approved in time and Nintendo had the

1381
01:11:12,220 --> 01:11:13,220
first patent.

1382
01:11:13,220 --> 01:11:14,220
So.

1383
01:11:14,220 --> 01:11:15,220
Yeah.

1384
01:11:15,220 --> 01:11:19,700
Well, they're also including like QVC and Tiger Direct, but not Amazon or Newegg.

1385
01:11:19,700 --> 01:11:21,820
So just pick places at random that sell it.

1386
01:11:21,820 --> 01:11:24,540
Cause I know that Amazon would just squash them.

1387
01:11:24,540 --> 01:11:25,540
Yeah.

1388
01:11:25,540 --> 01:11:26,540
Like Nintendo won't.

1389
01:11:26,540 --> 01:11:27,540
Oh, QVC.

1390
01:11:27,540 --> 01:11:28,540
I mean, even.

1391
01:11:28,540 --> 01:11:33,500
But they're asking, asking that Nintendo of America pay a reasonable royalty due to the

1392
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:34,500
alleged infringement.

1393
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:36,460
Isn't QVC the home shopping channel?

1394
01:11:36,460 --> 01:11:37,460
Yes, it is.

1395
01:11:37,460 --> 01:11:41,140
You ever see the video where the guy was washing the windows and he fell off the ladder?

1396
01:11:41,140 --> 01:11:43,900
I saw the one where the guy broke a TV with the Wiimote.

1397
01:11:43,900 --> 01:11:45,260
That's a good one too.

1398
01:11:45,260 --> 01:11:46,260
Yeah.

1399
01:11:46,260 --> 01:11:49,740
Watch the QVC video where the guy, he's like up in the, up in the background demonstrating

1400
01:11:49,740 --> 01:11:53,380
like this ladder and he just falls right off it.

1401
01:11:53,380 --> 01:11:55,340
It's awesome.

1402
01:11:55,340 --> 01:11:58,100
People hurting themselves on QVC is cool.

1403
01:11:58,100 --> 01:12:02,500
I'm glad you think so.

1404
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:05,940
Well, how about some FUs of the Week, huh?

1405
01:12:05,940 --> 01:12:24,780
Because I think that we're angsty people.

1406
01:12:24,780 --> 01:12:29,860
My FU of the week goes towards hotels near Disneyland for not being cheaper.

1407
01:12:29,860 --> 01:12:40,900
FU goes to the Superwoman at Subway who doesn't understand how to put together a stand-up

1408
01:12:40,900 --> 01:12:41,900
drop.

1409
01:12:41,900 --> 01:12:43,900
Or take instructions.

1410
01:12:43,900 --> 01:12:44,900
Or turkey.

1411
01:12:44,900 --> 01:12:50,180
Or give you a cup of Uncharted 3 demo on it.

1412
01:12:50,180 --> 01:12:52,300
I want an FU to Ultimate Pointer.

1413
01:12:52,300 --> 01:12:53,300
Fuck those guys.

1414
01:12:53,300 --> 01:12:55,300
Fuck them right in the ear.

1415
01:12:55,300 --> 01:12:56,300
Yeah.

1416
01:12:56,300 --> 01:12:57,300
Fuck them.

1417
01:12:57,300 --> 01:12:58,300
Fuck them.

1418
01:12:58,300 --> 01:12:59,300
Okay.

1419
01:12:59,300 --> 01:13:02,860
We really got our angst up quickly, didn't we?

1420
01:13:02,860 --> 01:13:05,980
I guess we're not all that pissed because we don't have Rob's soothing voice here to

1421
01:13:05,980 --> 01:13:07,740
keep us happy, huh?

1422
01:13:07,740 --> 01:13:09,940
Fuck Rob for that.

1423
01:13:09,940 --> 01:13:10,940
You know what?

1424
01:13:10,940 --> 01:13:12,100
Fuck that guy.

1425
01:13:12,100 --> 01:13:13,900
You like Rob.

1426
01:13:13,900 --> 01:13:16,980
And fuck the people who keep making Penguin movies too.

1427
01:13:16,980 --> 01:13:18,220
God damn.

1428
01:13:18,220 --> 01:13:21,760
I was at the movie theater the other day and I mean I was there to see The Lion King 3D

1429
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:25,620
so you'd expect that I'm gonna see this but I saw the commercial for Happy Feet 2 fucking

1430
01:13:25,620 --> 01:13:28,060
twice and once was enough.

1431
01:13:28,060 --> 01:13:29,060
Dear God.

1432
01:13:29,060 --> 01:13:32,400
Did it really need a sequel?

1433
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:33,400
Fuck Penguin movies.

1434
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:35,900
So do we have any more news, Loki?

1435
01:13:35,900 --> 01:13:36,900
Fucking Penguin movies.

1436
01:13:36,900 --> 01:13:37,900
Yes.

1437
01:13:37,900 --> 01:13:41,580
In fact, I'm gonna talk a little bit and since we normally try to put a dirty story towards

1438
01:13:41,580 --> 01:13:45,660
the end of all of our shows or at least I try to put a dirty story at the end of all

1439
01:13:45,660 --> 01:13:50,960
of our shows, we're gonna talk a little bit about pornography because that's fun.

1440
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:59,780
So there's this new video, I guess if you will, called Geek Girls the Gamers and of

1441
01:13:59,780 --> 01:14:05,240
course it is one of these genre porn videos that they're aiming towards people that play

1442
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:10,100
video games because you know, guys that play video games, they like watching pornography.

1443
01:14:10,100 --> 01:14:12,460
I mean that kind of goes hand in hand.

1444
01:14:12,460 --> 01:14:18,220
Of course, you know, they've got a few people in there that they're claiming, oh I love

1445
01:14:18,220 --> 01:14:21,900
games and stuff like that but then they've got actually some hardcore people that have

1446
01:14:21,900 --> 01:14:26,620
you know, the Zelda tattoos and button tattoos and all crazy shit like that which is a little

1447
01:14:26,620 --> 01:14:32,100
bit more believable but like, you know, rather than the one time my boyfriend played a game

1448
01:14:32,100 --> 01:14:34,740
and it was just fun.

1449
01:14:34,740 --> 01:14:43,240
Anyways, so yeah, if you're interested, it is coming out quite soon from New Sensations

1450
01:14:43,240 --> 01:14:51,140
and it's Geek Girls the Gamers, yes if that's not ridiculous enough like the Playboy spreads

1451
01:14:51,140 --> 01:14:52,140
that they do.

1452
01:14:52,140 --> 01:15:00,000
But this at least has actual people in it instead of you know, Photoshop, CG, fake characters

1453
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,260
that are topless.

1454
01:15:02,260 --> 01:15:06,020
Kids like boobs, especially nursing children.

1455
01:15:06,020 --> 01:15:07,020
Yeah.

1456
01:15:07,020 --> 01:15:10,180
Remember BMX Triple X?

1457
01:15:10,180 --> 01:15:11,180
Yes!

1458
01:15:11,180 --> 01:15:13,300
That game was awesomely bad.

1459
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:14,300
It was awesome!

1460
01:15:14,300 --> 01:15:16,780
No, no, no, it was awesomely bad.

1461
01:15:16,780 --> 01:15:20,660
It was like Dave Mira freestyle BMX 2 but you could be naked.

1462
01:15:20,660 --> 01:15:24,620
But no, it was an awesome game because, not necessarily because of that, because of all

1463
01:15:24,620 --> 01:15:29,060
the missions that they would give you like, you would have to, it's like ridiculous shit

1464
01:15:29,060 --> 01:15:33,800
like okay, you're gonna have to pull off some tricks to get this dog horny so they'll go

1465
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:35,320
fuck another dog.

1466
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:37,940
That's literally one of the missions in the first level of the game.

1467
01:15:37,940 --> 01:15:39,980
That is like one of like the first missions.

1468
01:15:39,980 --> 01:15:45,040
And then another one where you have to deliver, you know, hose to, you know, their clients

1469
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:46,040
using your bike.

1470
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:47,040
On the back of your bike.

1471
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:48,040
I remember that one.

1472
01:15:48,040 --> 01:15:49,260
On the back of your BMX bike.

1473
01:15:49,260 --> 01:15:50,360
You know what was great about that?

1474
01:15:50,360 --> 01:15:54,260
Just go to the cheat code, enter champagne room, and then you can watch all the titty

1475
01:15:54,260 --> 01:15:55,360
videos.

1476
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:56,460
It's that simple.

1477
01:15:56,460 --> 01:15:57,460
There you go.

1478
01:15:57,460 --> 01:16:01,980
And then you could go play Matt Hoffman because Matt Hoffman was just a better game.

1479
01:16:01,980 --> 01:16:02,980
I liked that game.

1480
01:16:02,980 --> 01:16:04,120
I thought it was pretty good.

1481
01:16:04,120 --> 01:16:10,060
It was ironic though that the PlayStation 2 and GameCube versions were uncensored but,

1482
01:16:10,060 --> 01:16:12,880
or it was like the Xbox and GameCube versions were uncensored.

1483
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:13,880
But the...

1484
01:16:13,880 --> 01:16:15,040
I don't know about the GameCube version.

1485
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:18,360
I know that they, I know that they gave me like an Xbox version.

1486
01:16:18,360 --> 01:16:22,140
The GameCube one was uncensored because that's what I had it on.

1487
01:16:22,140 --> 01:16:27,940
And they did some like girl family sue after the fact because she was, no that was...

1488
01:16:27,940 --> 01:16:28,940
Dave Mira Sue.

1489
01:16:28,940 --> 01:16:29,940
Girls Gone Wild.

1490
01:16:29,940 --> 01:16:30,940
No, that was the um...

1491
01:16:30,940 --> 01:16:32,380
That was the Girls Gone Wild, wasn't it?

1492
01:16:32,380 --> 01:16:33,380
The guy game.

1493
01:16:33,380 --> 01:16:34,380
What was it?

1494
01:16:34,380 --> 01:16:35,380
Yeah.

1495
01:16:35,380 --> 01:16:36,380
I don't even remember him being sued.

1496
01:16:36,380 --> 01:16:39,180
It was just that some underage girl managed to sneak into it.

1497
01:16:39,180 --> 01:16:41,340
And then they were like, you can't sell that game anymore.

1498
01:16:41,340 --> 01:16:42,700
I'm like, that's fine.

1499
01:16:42,700 --> 01:16:46,740
We weren't selling it to start with.

1500
01:16:46,740 --> 01:16:50,420
So one more story and then we're going to open up the Skyplane.

1501
01:16:50,420 --> 01:16:51,420
Sounds good.

1502
01:16:51,420 --> 01:16:52,420
Oh sure.

1503
01:16:52,420 --> 01:16:58,880
So apparently Microsoft is looking into auto mature filtering options.

1504
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:01,580
I don't really understand what I'm reading here.

1505
01:17:01,580 --> 01:17:04,940
I guess they did it a while ago where you can go ahead and set the games up so they

1506
01:17:04,940 --> 01:17:06,980
won't be quite as mature.

1507
01:17:06,980 --> 01:17:10,000
Which I think honestly is a pretty decent idea.

1508
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:13,280
Because you know, you really want to make Gears of War a little warmer and more cuddly

1509
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:15,700
so your eight year old can play it.

1510
01:17:15,700 --> 01:17:17,120
Really?

1511
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:19,820
They ought to make that game two ways.

1512
01:17:19,820 --> 01:17:23,580
Violent and ultra violent.

1513
01:17:23,580 --> 01:17:29,060
Now this is not part of a show rule but did you notice there was a story this week someone

1514
01:17:29,060 --> 01:17:33,900
that actually built a full size Lancer out of Legos.

1515
01:17:33,900 --> 01:17:35,660
It's like really?

1516
01:17:35,660 --> 01:17:38,060
That dude is my hero.

1517
01:17:38,060 --> 01:17:39,060
And it works.

1518
01:17:39,060 --> 01:17:40,860
We were a two Lancer family at one time.

1519
01:17:40,860 --> 01:17:44,940
No no, not Mitsubishi Lancer you dork.

1520
01:17:44,940 --> 01:17:46,140
The gun from Gears of War.

1521
01:17:46,140 --> 01:17:51,020
I know I was being silly.

1522
01:17:51,020 --> 01:17:55,860
I'm opening the Skyplane now because I'm tired of listening to Dan.

1523
01:17:55,860 --> 01:17:56,860
You live with me.

1524
01:17:56,860 --> 01:17:58,340
You have to listen to me all the time.

1525
01:17:58,340 --> 01:18:00,140
I could just go back to Rob's house.

1526
01:18:00,140 --> 01:18:04,700
Kijuto brings up, they were talking about Road Rash real quick.

1527
01:18:04,700 --> 01:18:09,180
That was one of those games, remember it was the Burnout team, Criterion I think was actually

1528
01:18:09,180 --> 01:18:10,180
going to put out a new version.

1529
01:18:10,180 --> 01:18:12,180
Oh my god, that would be amazing.

1530
01:18:12,180 --> 01:18:14,180
The video was fucking amazing.

1531
01:18:14,180 --> 01:18:17,220
You said they were going to or they are going to.

1532
01:18:17,220 --> 01:18:18,820
Why would they not do that?

1533
01:18:18,820 --> 01:18:20,880
They work for EA.

1534
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:21,880
This needs to happen.

1535
01:18:21,880 --> 01:18:23,460
Does anybody know someone at EA?

1536
01:18:23,460 --> 01:18:24,460
Yes.

1537
01:18:24,460 --> 01:18:25,460
For the record.

1538
01:18:25,460 --> 01:18:27,100
It's like don't have them make more Need for Speeds.

1539
01:18:27,100 --> 01:18:29,740
For god sakes, have Criterion make a Road Rash.

1540
01:18:29,740 --> 01:18:31,140
In fact, fuck that noise.

1541
01:18:31,140 --> 01:18:34,380
Why isn't Criterion making a new Burnout?

1542
01:18:34,380 --> 01:18:42,980
So the Skyplane is open, the number is 1-877-GAME-OLR or see us on Skype at Orange Lounge Radio.

1543
01:18:42,980 --> 01:18:46,060
Because we're awesome.

1544
01:18:46,060 --> 01:18:52,940
Until then, I'm going to read some of our very few tinky Twitter topics.

1545
01:18:52,940 --> 01:18:56,740
But I don't want to use whatever song that, oh we actually have a caller.

1546
01:18:56,740 --> 01:18:57,740
So I will answer this first.

1547
01:18:57,740 --> 01:19:00,940
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

1548
01:19:00,940 --> 01:19:02,540
Hey, it's CD Thunder.

1549
01:19:02,540 --> 01:19:07,100
Hi CD Thunder, what do you have for us today?

1550
01:19:07,100 --> 01:19:10,980
I have a couple things to discuss tonight.

1551
01:19:10,980 --> 01:19:11,980
Okay.

1552
01:19:11,980 --> 01:19:15,540
I, first off, I'd like to talk a little bit about Contra.

1553
01:19:15,540 --> 01:19:16,540
Okay.

1554
01:19:16,540 --> 01:19:19,340
Contra is so awesome.

1555
01:19:19,340 --> 01:19:27,860
I've played the first Contra a little bit, but I just wanted to actually get your guys'

1556
01:19:27,860 --> 01:19:32,140
opinions on Contra.

1557
01:19:32,140 --> 01:19:36,180
Contra is if you really hate yourself and want to be defeated at every turn.

1558
01:19:36,180 --> 01:19:41,140
Yeah, I mean, it was really hard because I couldn't even get past the first level without

1559
01:19:41,140 --> 01:19:43,780
dying like five or six times.

1560
01:19:43,780 --> 01:19:44,780
Practice.

1561
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:46,660
Contra is not very difficult.

1562
01:19:46,660 --> 01:19:52,540
Well, it's only hard, it's not hard if you know how to play it.

1563
01:19:52,540 --> 01:19:54,820
I really don't know how.

1564
01:19:54,820 --> 01:19:56,740
So what was your other topic?

1565
01:19:56,740 --> 01:19:59,740
Play the Contra on the Super NES.

1566
01:19:59,740 --> 01:20:00,740
Say what?

1567
01:20:00,740 --> 01:20:02,140
What was your second topic?

1568
01:20:02,140 --> 01:20:06,580
Oh, it's about Metal Slug.

1569
01:20:06,580 --> 01:20:07,980
I love Metal Slug.

1570
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:11,140
I like Camel Slug.

1571
01:20:11,140 --> 01:20:19,020
Saw the Orange Sons Radio YouTube video that showed the inside of your vault.

1572
01:20:19,020 --> 01:20:22,500
And I noticed they had a copy of Metal Slug Anthology.

1573
01:20:22,500 --> 01:20:24,300
Yes, we do.

1574
01:20:24,300 --> 01:20:25,300
Indeed.

1575
01:20:25,300 --> 01:20:29,420
And a bunch of other different Metal Slugs somewhere on various things.

1576
01:20:29,420 --> 01:20:32,260
Ironically, not my own, no Metal Slug for the actual Neo Geo.

1577
01:20:32,260 --> 01:20:33,260
Metal Slug, I really like that.

1578
01:20:33,260 --> 01:20:36,980
I mean, it's really basic.

1579
01:20:36,980 --> 01:20:40,580
All you do is you have a character and you go around killing people.

1580
01:20:40,580 --> 01:20:43,660
I mean, how can it get any more basic?

1581
01:20:43,660 --> 01:20:46,260
Do you have a copy of Metal Slug Anthology?

1582
01:20:46,260 --> 01:20:48,140
No, I don't actually.

1583
01:20:48,140 --> 01:20:51,940
You shouldn't get one.

1584
01:20:51,940 --> 01:20:52,940
It's really epic.

1585
01:20:52,940 --> 01:20:57,380
It's worth owning if you're a fan of run and gun games.

1586
01:20:57,380 --> 01:21:00,900
Basically all the Contras, all the Metal Slugs are just the best run and gun games you can

1587
01:21:00,900 --> 01:21:01,900
get.

1588
01:21:01,900 --> 01:21:05,380
You know, if you go out and buy them and play them, you will be happy.

1589
01:21:05,380 --> 01:21:07,500
And happiness is what you want, right?

1590
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:09,740
Yeah, pretty much.

1591
01:21:09,740 --> 01:21:10,740
Happiness in game form.

1592
01:21:10,740 --> 01:21:13,300
Kill all who oppose you.

1593
01:21:13,300 --> 01:21:14,300
Words to live by.

1594
01:21:14,300 --> 01:21:15,300
Yeah.

1595
01:21:15,300 --> 01:21:16,300
Got anything else for us tonight?

1596
01:21:16,300 --> 01:21:19,260
Yeah, a couple last minute things.

1597
01:21:19,260 --> 01:21:20,260
Okay.

1598
01:21:20,260 --> 01:21:24,620
I'd like to talk about two of my favorite games to play in the arcade.

1599
01:21:24,620 --> 01:21:27,340
How about one of your favorite games, because we've got to let other callers come in.

1600
01:21:27,340 --> 01:21:33,060
Okay, one of my favorite arcade games to play was, I'm not sure if you've heard of this

1601
01:21:33,060 --> 01:21:34,060
one, it's called CarnEvil.

1602
01:21:34,060 --> 01:21:35,060
Yes, I know CarnEvil.

1603
01:21:35,060 --> 01:21:36,060
That game was awful.

1604
01:21:36,060 --> 01:21:37,060
That game sucks balls.

1605
01:21:37,060 --> 01:21:40,220
Why don't you like it?

1606
01:21:40,220 --> 01:21:41,220
I liked it.

1607
01:21:41,220 --> 01:21:42,220
Because it was awful.

1608
01:21:42,220 --> 01:21:43,220
It's just real.

1609
01:21:43,220 --> 01:21:44,220
It's a gun game.

1610
01:21:44,220 --> 01:21:45,700
It wasn't very challenging either.

1611
01:21:45,700 --> 01:21:46,700
It wasn't a good gun game.

1612
01:21:46,700 --> 01:21:47,700
And I hate clowns.

1613
01:21:47,700 --> 01:21:48,700
Well, for me, it wasn't.

1614
01:21:48,700 --> 01:21:49,700
For other people, it wasn't.

1615
01:21:49,700 --> 01:21:50,700
But I'm glad that you like it.

1616
01:21:50,700 --> 01:21:51,700
But it was very gory.

1617
01:21:51,700 --> 01:21:52,700
It's very popular.

1618
01:21:52,700 --> 01:21:53,700
That's all I really remember.

1619
01:21:53,700 --> 01:21:54,700
You see those machines everywhere.

1620
01:21:54,700 --> 01:21:57,820
I think that I hate clowns so much that I didn't even enjoy shooting them.

1621
01:21:57,820 --> 01:21:58,820
You love clowns.

1622
01:21:58,820 --> 01:21:59,820
Shut up.

1623
01:21:59,820 --> 01:22:00,820
Oh, okay.

1624
01:22:00,820 --> 01:22:01,820
Yeah, I can understand that.

1625
01:22:01,820 --> 01:22:02,820
Yeah.

1626
01:22:02,820 --> 01:22:03,820
All right, well, thanks for giving us a call today, CD Thunder.

1627
01:22:03,820 --> 01:22:04,820
All right, thank you.

1628
01:22:04,820 --> 01:22:05,820
I'm going.

1629
01:22:05,820 --> 01:22:06,820
Thanks for listening.

1630
01:22:06,820 --> 01:22:07,820
Thank you.

1631
01:22:07,820 --> 01:22:08,820
All right.

1632
01:22:08,820 --> 01:22:11,660
So I sent Jamie real quick, because I know this is going to make amazing radio, that

1633
01:22:11,660 --> 01:22:16,900
trailer for the new Road Rash game.

1634
01:22:16,900 --> 01:22:21,540
It's a pre-visual thing that this guy is working on.

1635
01:22:21,540 --> 01:22:32,740
Dude, so we have a bike, and the life bar is a chain going to the deformed skull.

1636
01:22:32,740 --> 01:22:33,740
Dude, that dude kicked a van.

1637
01:22:33,740 --> 01:22:34,740
Now, kick him.

1638
01:22:34,740 --> 01:22:35,740
Kick him.

1639
01:22:35,740 --> 01:22:36,740
Kick him.

1640
01:22:36,740 --> 01:22:37,740
Kick him.

1641
01:22:37,740 --> 01:22:38,740
Kick him.

1642
01:22:38,740 --> 01:22:39,740
In the face.

1643
01:22:39,740 --> 01:22:40,740
Oh, oh, dude, he's grappling him.

1644
01:22:40,740 --> 01:22:41,740
Oh, you should have pushed him into that car.

1645
01:22:41,740 --> 01:22:42,740
I would buy like five copies of this.

1646
01:22:42,740 --> 01:22:43,740
Oh, gato.

1647
01:22:43,740 --> 01:22:44,740
Oh, you can see that some of the cars are untextured, so yeah.

1648
01:22:44,740 --> 01:22:45,740
Well, yeah, it's all free bits.

1649
01:22:45,740 --> 01:22:46,740
Yeah, the whole world's untextured.

1650
01:22:46,740 --> 01:22:47,740
Unless he's riding a bicycle.

1651
01:22:47,740 --> 01:22:48,740
That's pretty cool.

1652
01:22:48,740 --> 01:22:49,740
All right, well, hey, we got another call today.

1653
01:22:49,740 --> 01:23:09,460
So we're going to put this up on our tumbler, how's that sound?

1654
01:23:09,460 --> 01:23:14,620
I detect so much madness.

1655
01:23:14,620 --> 01:23:16,740
Hello, this is Orange Jones Radio, who's this?

1656
01:23:16,740 --> 01:23:18,740
Hey, it's the one and only Ronma.

1657
01:23:18,740 --> 01:23:19,740
Ron.

1658
01:23:19,740 --> 01:23:20,740
Hi.

1659
01:23:20,740 --> 01:23:21,740
How are you?

1660
01:23:21,740 --> 01:23:22,740
Good.

1661
01:23:22,740 --> 01:23:23,740
I'm doing good.

1662
01:23:23,740 --> 01:23:24,740
How about you?

1663
01:23:24,740 --> 01:23:25,740
I'm kind of wishing Rob was here.

1664
01:23:25,740 --> 01:23:30,740
Now, before I continue, I have to tell everyone in the chat room, take two drinks.

1665
01:23:30,740 --> 01:23:31,740
Why?

1666
01:23:31,740 --> 01:23:37,260
Well, there is a drinking game where everyone has to do like one or two shots when I call

1667
01:23:37,260 --> 01:23:38,260
in, so.

1668
01:23:38,260 --> 01:23:39,260
Oh, yeah.

1669
01:23:39,260 --> 01:23:40,260
Well, we've got apple wine.

1670
01:23:40,260 --> 01:23:41,260
Does that count?

1671
01:23:41,260 --> 01:23:42,260
Good enough.

1672
01:23:42,260 --> 01:23:43,260
Okay.

1673
01:23:43,260 --> 01:23:45,740
Well, no, I think I've got like some vodka left over from three years ago.

1674
01:23:45,740 --> 01:23:46,740
I don't think so.

1675
01:23:46,740 --> 01:23:52,100
I had a bottle of root beer flavored vodka in my cabinet, went looking for it the other

1676
01:23:52,100 --> 01:23:57,100
day and it was empty and I realized my other friend who was the local Jack Daniels guy

1677
01:23:57,100 --> 01:23:58,100
drank it.

1678
01:23:58,100 --> 01:23:59,100
Fucking lush.

1679
01:23:59,100 --> 01:24:00,100
Fun.

1680
01:24:00,100 --> 01:24:03,540
And for the record, we do have that vanilla vodka on top of the fridge that I got for

1681
01:24:03,540 --> 01:24:06,780
the party and no one ever opened, like my birthday three years ago.

1682
01:24:06,780 --> 01:24:07,780
What?

1683
01:24:07,780 --> 01:24:08,780
Nice.

1684
01:24:08,780 --> 01:24:09,780
It's still there?

1685
01:24:09,780 --> 01:24:10,780
Okay.

1686
01:24:10,780 --> 01:24:11,780
So, hi.

1687
01:24:11,780 --> 01:24:12,780
What's up?

1688
01:24:12,780 --> 01:24:13,780
I think I drank that when you weren't looking.

1689
01:24:13,780 --> 01:24:14,780
You don't drink.

1690
01:24:14,780 --> 01:24:15,780
I drink the shit out of that vodka.

1691
01:24:15,780 --> 01:24:16,780
I was like, clang.

1692
01:24:16,780 --> 01:24:22,740
He has, if he had one shot, he would be red in the face and sitting on the couch falling

1693
01:24:22,740 --> 01:24:23,740
asleep.

1694
01:24:23,740 --> 01:24:24,740
That's not true.

1695
01:24:24,740 --> 01:24:25,740
That is, okay, two shots.

1696
01:24:25,740 --> 01:24:28,740
Oh, probably wouldn't even take one.

1697
01:24:28,740 --> 01:24:29,740
See?

1698
01:24:29,740 --> 01:24:31,740
So, Dan's a lush?

1699
01:24:31,740 --> 01:24:32,740
No.

1700
01:24:32,740 --> 01:24:33,740
Dan's not.

1701
01:24:33,740 --> 01:24:34,740
Jamie's a lush.

1702
01:24:34,740 --> 01:24:35,740
Dan's not a very good alcoholic.

1703
01:24:35,740 --> 01:24:39,780
Well, Jamie, you and Patty would have fun together.

1704
01:24:39,780 --> 01:24:45,340
I'd like to come out to your neck of the woods and go drinking with you and Patty.

1705
01:24:45,340 --> 01:24:47,220
That means y'all will be raiding my liquor cabinet.

1706
01:24:47,220 --> 01:24:48,220
Not that I would be complaining.

1707
01:24:48,220 --> 01:24:49,220
Oh my God, no.

1708
01:24:49,220 --> 01:24:51,580
You'd be contributing to your liquor cabinet and getting you good beer.

1709
01:24:51,580 --> 01:24:55,220
See, that's why I have parties, to get rid of the alcohol.

1710
01:24:55,220 --> 01:24:58,580
At the end of the night, I open up the cab and I'm like, where did all of this come from?

1711
01:24:58,580 --> 01:25:01,220
Well, that's why for my birthday I have the beer potluck.

1712
01:25:01,220 --> 01:25:02,220
Ah.

1713
01:25:02,220 --> 01:25:03,220
Mm.

1714
01:25:03,220 --> 01:25:07,680
So, so how about the show so far, huh?

1715
01:25:07,680 --> 01:25:08,820
So far, so good.

1716
01:25:08,820 --> 01:25:12,180
I give it three out of four train wrecks.

1717
01:25:12,180 --> 01:25:13,180
Okay.

1718
01:25:13,180 --> 01:25:14,820
So we're not a derpisode fully?

1719
01:25:14,820 --> 01:25:15,820
We're a minor derp.

1720
01:25:15,820 --> 01:25:16,820
Far from derp.

1721
01:25:16,820 --> 01:25:18,860
What are you talking about?

1722
01:25:18,860 --> 01:25:19,860
That's my podcast.

1723
01:25:19,860 --> 01:25:21,060
We're the derpy ones.

1724
01:25:21,060 --> 01:25:22,700
We can derail under five minutes.

1725
01:25:22,700 --> 01:25:27,380
Any show that I appear on for the whole show is immediately awesome.

1726
01:25:27,380 --> 01:25:32,100
I've just been letting them get out there testosteroneing, so it's been cool.

1727
01:25:32,100 --> 01:25:33,100
Fair enough.

1728
01:25:33,100 --> 01:25:35,860
So what else is on your mind?

1729
01:25:35,860 --> 01:25:41,440
Well, I think it was last weekend, I believe, it was me, Patty, and Ziba.

1730
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:46,740
We went down to the Jersey Shore as Ziba played us to a classic arcade.

1731
01:25:46,740 --> 01:25:47,740
Really?

1732
01:25:47,740 --> 01:25:48,740
Oh, so cool.

1733
01:25:48,740 --> 01:25:49,740
Yeah.

1734
01:25:49,740 --> 01:25:51,300
So what all did they have in the classic arcade?

1735
01:25:51,300 --> 01:25:53,700
Like, were there tons of pins?

1736
01:25:53,700 --> 01:25:54,700
Quit acting like you care about classic arcade games.

1737
01:25:54,700 --> 01:25:55,700
There were some.

1738
01:25:55,700 --> 01:25:56,700
I think I sent you a couple of pictures.

1739
01:25:56,700 --> 01:25:57,700
I did.

1740
01:25:57,700 --> 01:25:58,700
They're set up.

1741
01:25:58,700 --> 01:25:59,700
What did you play?

1742
01:25:59,700 --> 01:26:00,700
I...

1743
01:26:00,700 --> 01:26:01,700
Okay, what did you play?

1744
01:26:01,700 --> 01:26:02,700
Okay, I played Super Mario Brothers.

1745
01:26:02,700 --> 01:26:03,700
Oh, nice.

1746
01:26:03,700 --> 01:26:05,660
First, the Super Mario Brothers is a cool machine.

1747
01:26:05,660 --> 01:26:06,980
Yeah.

1748
01:26:06,980 --> 01:26:10,860
I was kind of pissed that there was no gauntlet machine, because I put quarters in it like

1749
01:26:10,860 --> 01:26:11,860
nobody else's business.

1750
01:26:11,860 --> 01:26:13,220
That and Ninja Turtles.

1751
01:26:13,220 --> 01:26:15,500
Yeah, those are both really good.

1752
01:26:15,500 --> 01:26:16,500
Sweet.

1753
01:26:16,500 --> 01:26:18,060
They're much, much better if you have friends, though.

1754
01:26:18,060 --> 01:26:22,460
Four player gauntlet, I could spend like five bucks on without even realizing that I did

1755
01:26:22,460 --> 01:26:23,460
it.

1756
01:26:23,460 --> 01:26:24,460
Yeah.

1757
01:26:24,460 --> 01:26:25,840
You just never wanted to quit playing.

1758
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:27,020
As long as your friends were still in it.

1759
01:26:27,020 --> 01:26:30,540
I would give other people quarters so that they would keep playing.

1760
01:26:30,540 --> 01:26:33,540
That was what it was like playing Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, though.

1761
01:26:33,540 --> 01:26:37,220
You know, when you were close to the end of the game and you really wanted to make it.

1762
01:26:37,220 --> 01:26:38,580
It's like, here, take my tokens.

1763
01:26:38,580 --> 01:26:39,580
Cool.

1764
01:26:39,580 --> 01:26:41,980
Ninja Turtles, though, got harder when you had more people.

1765
01:26:41,980 --> 01:26:42,980
It was great.

1766
01:26:42,980 --> 01:26:44,240
Gauntlet actually got easier.

1767
01:26:44,240 --> 01:26:45,740
You could last longer.

1768
01:26:45,740 --> 01:26:49,540
Oh, you got me thinking of Gauntlet 2 for Nintendo.

1769
01:26:49,540 --> 01:26:51,220
I thought I had beat that game.

1770
01:26:51,220 --> 01:26:54,060
After 150 levels, I said, the hell with it and walked away.

1771
01:26:54,060 --> 01:26:58,420
You know, I never got Gauntlet 2 on the NES, and I really wish that I had, because it's

1772
01:26:58,420 --> 01:27:00,740
actually kind of a cool little version.

1773
01:27:00,740 --> 01:27:06,540
I do have Gauntlet 4 for the Genesis, which is basically Gauntlet 1 for the Genesis, and

1774
01:27:06,540 --> 01:27:11,820
it's got a quest mode, and it's actually four players if you have a multitap, but I've never

1775
01:27:11,820 --> 01:27:13,660
managed to get four people on it at once.

1776
01:27:13,660 --> 01:27:15,380
It's one of the failures of my life.

1777
01:27:15,380 --> 01:27:18,060
Well, I can get you a copy of Gauntlet 2.

1778
01:27:18,060 --> 01:27:19,060
That's not too hard.

1779
01:27:19,060 --> 01:27:20,620
I don't really need one at this point.

1780
01:27:20,620 --> 01:27:24,540
I'm just saying, I never picked it up back in the day, and watching videos and stuff

1781
01:27:24,540 --> 01:27:30,860
of it later on, I kind of wish that I had, because it looks like it was pretty choice.

1782
01:27:30,860 --> 01:27:31,860
Indeed it was.

1783
01:27:31,860 --> 01:27:33,380
I wish I had picked up the strategy guide for it.

1784
01:27:33,380 --> 01:27:34,380
Oh, well.

1785
01:27:34,380 --> 01:27:35,380
It is what it is.

1786
01:27:35,380 --> 01:27:39,140
So, there were pinball tables there, though, right?

1787
01:27:39,140 --> 01:27:40,140
Yes.

1788
01:27:40,140 --> 01:27:43,940
One of my friends, Ari, he was playing pinball while I was chucking quarters into a theater

1789
01:27:43,940 --> 01:27:46,220
of magic machine.

1790
01:27:46,220 --> 01:27:49,460
Theater of magic is awesome.

1791
01:27:49,460 --> 01:27:56,460
And then I left that, and I went to play this large, old-school Atari pinball machine.

1792
01:27:56,460 --> 01:27:57,460
Was it Hercules?

1793
01:27:57,460 --> 01:27:58,460
Yes, it was.

1794
01:27:58,460 --> 01:27:59,460
Yes.

1795
01:27:59,460 --> 01:28:00,460
Ah.

1796
01:28:00,460 --> 01:28:01,660
Someone in chat mentioned Hercules.

1797
01:28:01,660 --> 01:28:03,380
I've never played a Hercules machine.

1798
01:28:03,380 --> 01:28:05,900
I've seen the back glass, for one.

1799
01:28:05,900 --> 01:28:09,780
It took me five minutes, like five tries to figure out how to play this stupid thing,

1800
01:28:09,780 --> 01:28:12,820
because I'm pulling it back thinking all I got to do is send it forward.

1801
01:28:12,820 --> 01:28:18,900
No, I got to push back and shove it forth like a plunger to send the ball rolling.

1802
01:28:18,900 --> 01:28:26,940
Well, that sounds like, you know, something just makes me think that I have seen one before,

1803
01:28:26,940 --> 01:28:27,940
though, at one of the pinball.

1804
01:28:27,940 --> 01:28:32,020
Didn't they have one at one of the pinball things we went to, Dan?

1805
01:28:32,020 --> 01:28:33,020
I thought that they did.

1806
01:28:33,020 --> 01:28:34,420
Did they have a Hercules?

1807
01:28:34,420 --> 01:28:35,420
I don't think.

1808
01:28:35,420 --> 01:28:36,420
No, they just had that giant-

1809
01:28:36,420 --> 01:28:38,220
It was just a giant mockup.

1810
01:28:38,220 --> 01:28:47,060
Yeah, that used a pool cue, a cue ball for the pin, for the pinball.

1811
01:28:47,060 --> 01:28:48,140
It's kind of funny.

1812
01:28:48,140 --> 01:28:49,140
That sounds pretty cool.

1813
01:28:49,140 --> 01:28:52,620
It was pretty cool, but it got boring after five minutes, because I could not reach from

1814
01:28:52,620 --> 01:28:57,500
one side to the other very easily, because my short arms.

1815
01:28:57,500 --> 01:29:04,420
So anything else, like how classic was classic, was it just like that 80s era, or did it get

1816
01:29:04,420 --> 01:29:10,980
into the later 90s, or was it just like early 80s to mid-90s?

1817
01:29:10,980 --> 01:29:15,860
The only machine in this one section that was current was a DDR Max II machine.

1818
01:29:15,860 --> 01:29:19,620
Oh, you can't have an arcade without a DDR, shoved in the summer.

1819
01:29:19,620 --> 01:29:26,500
Everything else was just pure 80s, there was a Tapper machine, there was Frogger, no Super

1820
01:29:26,500 --> 01:29:29,780
Sprint, there was Iron Man off-road floating around there, too.

1821
01:29:29,780 --> 01:29:30,780
Hey, cool.

1822
01:29:30,780 --> 01:29:31,980
Well, that's pretty awesome.

1823
01:29:31,980 --> 01:29:36,140
I'm going to have to check that place out if I can ever get to your neck of the woods.

1824
01:29:36,140 --> 01:29:40,260
Well, I think I have a large enough box to ship you in.

1825
01:29:40,260 --> 01:29:42,200
I'm fragile.

1826
01:29:42,200 --> 01:29:44,100
I will make sure of that.

1827
01:29:44,100 --> 01:29:45,100
Fragile.

1828
01:29:45,100 --> 01:29:46,880
Well, I'll think about it.

1829
01:29:46,880 --> 01:29:51,300
Let me wait until this semester's over, and then I'll see if I can be shipped.

1830
01:29:51,300 --> 01:29:52,300
Fair enough.

1831
01:29:52,300 --> 01:29:57,180
I think Patty would love that, because she's about to spaz at her job, so...

1832
01:29:57,180 --> 01:29:59,620
I've been hearing.

1833
01:29:59,620 --> 01:30:02,300
Yeah, she's now an assistant manager.

1834
01:30:02,300 --> 01:30:06,060
I feel very sorry for her.

1835
01:30:06,060 --> 01:30:07,740
That makes two of us.

1836
01:30:07,740 --> 01:30:08,740
Yeah.

1837
01:30:08,740 --> 01:30:11,620
Well, you got anything else for us tonight?

1838
01:30:11,620 --> 01:30:12,780
Um...

1839
01:30:12,780 --> 01:30:15,940
Actually, no, that's it.

1840
01:30:15,940 --> 01:30:16,940
All right.

1841
01:30:16,940 --> 01:30:17,940
Well...

1842
01:30:17,940 --> 01:30:20,800
Ronma, before you go, I want you to do something for me.

1843
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:21,800
That being?

1844
01:30:21,800 --> 01:30:22,800
That being black.

1845
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:26,060
No, no, no, I don't stay black anymore.

1846
01:30:26,060 --> 01:30:27,060
That's not my style.

1847
01:30:27,060 --> 01:30:28,060
Hey!

1848
01:30:28,060 --> 01:30:29,060
What the fuck did I say?

1849
01:30:29,060 --> 01:30:30,060
Stay black!

1850
01:30:30,060 --> 01:30:31,060
No, I stay nerdy, man!

1851
01:30:31,060 --> 01:30:32,060
Stay nerdy!

1852
01:30:32,060 --> 01:30:33,060
Stay that, too.

1853
01:30:33,060 --> 01:30:34,060
Keep it nerdy, motherfucker.

1854
01:30:34,060 --> 01:30:35,060
Keep it nerdy.

1855
01:30:35,060 --> 01:30:36,060
All right.

1856
01:30:36,060 --> 01:30:37,060
Okay.

1857
01:30:37,060 --> 01:30:38,060
Thanks for calling in.

1858
01:30:38,060 --> 01:30:39,060
All right.

1859
01:30:39,060 --> 01:30:40,060
Bye, Ronchan.

1860
01:30:40,060 --> 01:30:41,060
Bye.

1861
01:30:41,060 --> 01:30:42,060
Stay black.

1862
01:30:42,060 --> 01:30:43,060
Bye.

1863
01:30:43,060 --> 01:30:44,060
All right.

1864
01:30:44,060 --> 01:30:45,060
We will take a couple more calls.

1865
01:30:45,060 --> 01:30:46,060
It's 1-877-AGAMEOLR.

1866
01:30:46,060 --> 01:30:52,140
And then we'll go ahead and see what is on our Twitter.

1867
01:30:52,140 --> 01:30:59,660
We have a mention from Niconicochan that says tweet heart.

1868
01:30:59,660 --> 01:31:06,340
Tigerclaw sends us a story about Dota 2 wants you.

1869
01:31:06,340 --> 01:31:07,420
Are you ready?

1870
01:31:07,420 --> 01:31:14,700
And that's a big fan wanting a beta key that they put up a sign.

1871
01:31:14,700 --> 01:31:16,860
So that's kind of interesting.

1872
01:31:16,860 --> 01:31:19,180
He paid $3,000 for an electronic billboard.

1873
01:31:19,180 --> 01:31:20,180
That's pretty crazy.

1874
01:31:20,180 --> 01:31:21,180
He didn't actually pay $3,000.

1875
01:31:21,180 --> 01:31:22,180
That's just photoshopped?

1876
01:31:22,180 --> 01:31:23,180
No, no.

1877
01:31:23,180 --> 01:31:26,980
What ended up happening is it would have cost him $3,000 to normally rent one of those signs

1878
01:31:26,980 --> 01:31:27,980
for a month.

1879
01:31:27,980 --> 01:31:30,300
He actually called Clear Channel in this case.

1880
01:31:30,300 --> 01:31:31,300
Oh, yeah.

1881
01:31:31,300 --> 01:31:32,300
And got it for free.

1882
01:31:32,300 --> 01:31:33,300
Yeah.

1883
01:31:33,300 --> 01:31:34,300
Got it for free.

1884
01:31:34,300 --> 01:31:35,300
Because they were only running it for an hour.

1885
01:31:35,300 --> 01:31:36,300
It was part of their...

1886
01:31:36,300 --> 01:31:37,300
Because that's one of those digital billboards.

1887
01:31:37,300 --> 01:31:38,540
So you could just take a picture of it.

1888
01:31:38,540 --> 01:31:41,340
So he took a picture of it with his friends.

1889
01:31:41,340 --> 01:31:43,780
Because it's a picture contest to get keys.

1890
01:31:43,780 --> 01:31:44,780
Oh, I see.

1891
01:31:44,780 --> 01:31:46,700
Well, that's pretty cool.

1892
01:31:46,700 --> 01:31:48,140
The links people will go to.

1893
01:31:48,140 --> 01:31:50,740
Guys, we're taking one more call.

1894
01:31:50,740 --> 01:31:53,440
So that's 1877-GAME-OLR.

1895
01:31:53,440 --> 01:31:59,340
We also have another one from Tigerclaw about Gotham City Impostors beta beginning on October

1896
01:31:59,340 --> 01:32:01,540
5th.

1897
01:32:01,540 --> 01:32:04,340
And that's a PC game.

1898
01:32:04,340 --> 01:32:05,900
Weird.

1899
01:32:05,900 --> 01:32:09,020
And Steam codes have already been mailed out to those who are accepted.

1900
01:32:09,020 --> 01:32:12,540
And the client can be downloaded now, but the beta will not begin until next week.

1901
01:32:12,540 --> 01:32:13,540
So yay.

1902
01:32:13,540 --> 01:32:14,540
Any more calls?

1903
01:32:14,540 --> 01:32:18,460
So nobody else wants to call and talk to Dan?

1904
01:32:18,460 --> 01:32:19,460
They're afraid of you.

1905
01:32:19,460 --> 01:32:20,940
They're intimidated by your awesomeness.

1906
01:32:20,940 --> 01:32:23,280
Fuck you guys.

1907
01:32:23,280 --> 01:32:24,900
Someone called Dan so I don't have to...

1908
01:32:24,900 --> 01:32:25,900
No, no, no.

1909
01:32:25,900 --> 01:32:28,180
I don't even want to talk to anyone anymore.

1910
01:32:28,180 --> 01:32:29,780
Now you should extra call him.

1911
01:32:29,780 --> 01:32:33,100
All right, well, I'm closing the Skype line.

1912
01:32:33,100 --> 01:32:36,020
Yeah, fuck the Skype line.

1913
01:32:36,020 --> 01:32:37,860
They're intimidated by you, I swear.

1914
01:32:37,860 --> 01:32:40,460
You know, I can't blame them.

1915
01:32:40,460 --> 01:32:41,780
I'm not intimidated by you.

1916
01:32:41,780 --> 01:32:48,860
I am quite the imposing presence when I roll into the O.L.R. like, what?

1917
01:32:48,860 --> 01:32:49,860
Yeah.

1918
01:32:49,860 --> 01:32:54,500
Well, I guess since that's it, that's pretty much the show.

1919
01:32:54,500 --> 01:32:56,220
So how about...

1920
01:32:56,220 --> 01:33:00,660
And I'm not going to do a fortune cookie tonight either, so...

1921
01:33:00,660 --> 01:33:01,660
No fortune cookie?

1922
01:33:01,660 --> 01:33:02,660
No.

1923
01:33:02,660 --> 01:33:03,660
All I have to do is that.

1924
01:33:03,660 --> 01:33:04,660
Because it's a derpisode and I don't care.

1925
01:33:04,660 --> 01:33:11,940
You should just play the quartet song again.

1926
01:33:11,940 --> 01:33:12,940
Okay.

1927
01:33:12,940 --> 01:33:13,940
I'll play the quartet song again.

1928
01:33:13,940 --> 01:33:14,940
How's that sound?

1929
01:33:14,940 --> 01:33:16,740
The quartet of loop in the future.

1930
01:33:16,740 --> 01:33:21,940
But because you have all asked for it, I will be doing about 30 minutes to an hour of pump

1931
01:33:21,940 --> 01:33:22,940
up volume.

1932
01:33:22,940 --> 01:33:24,500
So stay tuned after the show.

1933
01:33:24,500 --> 01:33:25,500
Nobody asked for that.

1934
01:33:25,500 --> 01:33:26,500
Yes, they did.

1935
01:33:26,500 --> 01:33:27,500
Shut up.

1936
01:33:27,500 --> 01:33:28,500
That's like torture on the radio.

1937
01:33:28,500 --> 01:33:30,020
No, it is not.

1938
01:33:30,020 --> 01:33:31,020
Everyone thinks it's completely awesome.

1939
01:33:31,020 --> 01:33:33,580
I can't help it if you are torture on the damn radio.

1940
01:33:33,580 --> 01:33:36,300
I'm from God.

1941
01:33:36,300 --> 01:33:38,300
You are punishment.

1942
01:33:38,300 --> 01:33:39,300
For you.

1943
01:33:39,300 --> 01:33:40,860
I love you.

1944
01:33:40,860 --> 01:33:43,340
Rob's back next week, just reminding everybody.

1945
01:33:43,340 --> 01:33:46,700
I know you guys are excited that Rob will be back.

1946
01:33:46,700 --> 01:33:48,180
I love having you on the show.

1947
01:33:48,180 --> 01:33:49,180
It's great.

1948
01:33:49,180 --> 01:33:50,180
It sucks.

1949
01:33:50,180 --> 01:33:51,180
Wouldn't you guys rather have me here than Jamie?

1950
01:33:51,180 --> 01:33:53,020
Rob does not suck on the air.

1951
01:33:53,020 --> 01:33:54,580
Jamie doesn't even really talk.

1952
01:33:54,580 --> 01:33:55,900
Yes I do.

1953
01:33:55,900 --> 01:33:57,180
You have been fucking...

1954
01:33:57,180 --> 01:34:00,980
I could totally be on the show and you guys would almost not even notice that Jamie was

1955
01:34:00,980 --> 01:34:03,060
gone.

1956
01:34:03,060 --> 01:34:04,060
I have to...

1957
01:34:04,060 --> 01:34:07,820
She looks so mad she can barely talk.

1958
01:34:07,820 --> 01:34:11,880
I wish I would have had a picture of the look on her face a minute ago.

1959
01:34:11,880 --> 01:34:15,540
Someone has to watch the chat room and it's usually me because I'm the only one that can

1960
01:34:15,540 --> 01:34:21,140
keep all of these rowdy people under some semblance of not kicking each other all over

1961
01:34:21,140 --> 01:34:22,460
the place with trouts.

1962
01:34:22,460 --> 01:34:24,260
Dude, all the people are like cool.

1963
01:34:24,260 --> 01:34:25,260
They are cool.

1964
01:34:25,260 --> 01:34:26,420
They have no problem in there.

1965
01:34:26,420 --> 01:34:28,540
You're just playing Warcraft.

1966
01:34:28,540 --> 01:34:30,380
I do not play Warcraft during the show, Dan.

1967
01:34:30,380 --> 01:34:33,100
That's why the band is going to suck.

1968
01:34:33,100 --> 01:34:35,220
I can stream video while you guys do the show.

1969
01:34:35,220 --> 01:34:38,060
It's really hard to play the board when I play that bitch.

1970
01:34:38,060 --> 01:34:39,060
You know what?

1971
01:34:39,060 --> 01:34:40,060
What?

1972
01:34:40,060 --> 01:34:41,060
End of the show!

1973
01:34:41,060 --> 01:34:42,060
Bye everybody!

1974
01:34:42,060 --> 01:34:43,060
Goodnight!

1975
01:34:43,060 --> 01:34:44,060
Stay black!

1976
01:34:44,060 --> 01:34:48,060
