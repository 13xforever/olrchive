1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,120
The PlayStation Vita has an American launch date.

2
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,680
Blizzard will throw in a free game if you commit to a year of Warcraft.

3
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:31,360
And updates to the 3DS firmware are detailed.

4
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:34,840
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

5
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,840
where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.

6
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:46,800
We are live at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com with the 433rd episode of our show for this

7
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,080
October the 20, what is it today, the 23rd of 2011.

8
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:55,680
We do tape live every Sunday night at All Games Radio right after the Bobby Black Wolf

9
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,680
Show.

10
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,240
6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, about.

11
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:03,080
My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours, not sadly with

12
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,520
my awesome co-host Dark Sakura.

13
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,620
She has the night off.

14
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:09,480
She is en route to Anaheim right now.

15
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,880
She's going to Blizzcon a little too late.

16
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,920
No, obviously what's next door to Blizzcon?

17
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:15,920
Disneyland.

18
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,400
And that is the true destination for her and the hubby.

19
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,600
But joining me tonight is the one and only tech master, Loki.

20
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,600
Hello.

21
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,600
How you doing, Loki?

22
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,600
I'm doing fine.

23
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,600
Awesome.

24
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,360
So what is the perennial question for our chat room?

25
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:31,160
They always want to know what was dinner tonight?

26
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:34,480
Double Western Bacon Cheeseburger from Carl's Jr.

27
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,480
Awesome.

28
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,480
Chat.

29
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:41,800
Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to join us live in our chat room.

30
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:48,000
Joining us tonight, since Dark Sakura is not here, we do have another panelist here tonight.

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,100
So kind to always fill in on all the OLR network shows when there's an opening.

32
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,920
Say hello to the one and only Salacious Pop.

33
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,920
What up?

34
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,360
How you doing, Salacious Pop?

35
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,360
I'm doing alright.

36
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,360
How are you?

37
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,360
Sup?

38
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,360
I am good.

39
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,360
What's new with you?

40
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,880
How's life been treating you?

41
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,880
Fairly boring.

42
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,880
I'm around.

43
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,880
I live with you.

44
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,880
You should know.

45
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,880
You don't have to ask me that.

46
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:15,360
Well, this is what we call Radio Banter, where you entertain the listeners.

47
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,760
You still have a lot to learn, young one.

48
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,760
Alright.

49
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,760
Join our chat room.

50
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,760
Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

51
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:25,360
DDRDollarBill is in our chat room tonight saying it's an all-male review.

52
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,000
Yes, tonight is an all-male review.

53
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,320
Maybe we'll have some female callers.

54
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,320
We'll see.

55
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:34,560
We will take your live calls later on in the show in Part B.

56
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,840
Getting right into the video game chat tonight, Derek H. throws down the gauntlet, so to speak,

57
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,840
in our chat room.

58
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:46,040
OLR, I would like to invite you and your listeners to participate in the big battle racing series

59
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,760
on Forza 4.

60
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,880
Now I have heard about the big battle that's going on.

61
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:54,200
It's this thing that Derek does with a lot of the all-game shows, and I participated

62
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,580
in one a little while ago when it was pinball.

63
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:02,440
The only reservation I have is that it's Forza 4, and I really stink at the Forza series.

64
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,360
I'm usually more into the arcade racers.

65
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:09,680
Like if we were talking like Blur, Burnout, Mario Kart, like that's the stuff up my alley.

66
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,140
The real stuff, like Forza, Gran Turismo, I am terrible at that stuff.

67
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,640
I consistently drive in walls.

68
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,120
Are you a Forza person, Loki?

69
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,880
Would you be able to represent the OL Army?

70
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,080
I don't even have Forza.

71
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:26,640
I need someone to step up in our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com to participate

72
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,760
on behalf of OLR.

73
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,160
We need somebody to do it.

74
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:33,000
Somebody needs to show that we are not all weak when it comes to racing games.

75
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,440
But of course, when Mario Kart 7 comes out, it's on.

76
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,180
You'd play it if it was Initial D, right?

77
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,180
You love that game.

78
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,720
Yeah, as long as it had like Eurobeat in the background.

79
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,720
Or Outrun.

80
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,720
That would be awesome.

81
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,360
But see, Initial D, again, is an arcade racer.

82
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,080
And I love Midnight Maximum Tune in the arcades.

83
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,120
I'd be down with Ridge Racer.

84
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,120
Ridge Racer.

85
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,120
Ridge Racer!

86
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:53,680
Anyway, if you want more information on that, you want to sign up on behalf of Orange Lounge

87
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,680
Radio.

88
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,280
TheBigBattle.net.

89
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,280
So check that out.

90
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:05,400
And yeah, we need some helps representing Forza 4, because lord knows I can't.

91
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:11,680
Alright, before we get into our gaming week, I wanted to talk about this a little bit.

92
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,140
Well first, I gotta throw this out there.

93
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,240
We've been mentioning this the past couple weeks on the show.

94
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,840
I gotta reiterate this.

95
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:23,800
We are nominated in the 2011 Podcast Awards, www.podcastawards.com.

96
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,320
And we need your votes.

97
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,720
You can vote every day between now and the 27th.

98
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,600
We mentioned this last week on the show.

99
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,080
We don't ask a lot here at Orange Lounge Radio.

100
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,160
We don't play advertising on the show.

101
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:37,620
We don't ask for your money or premium subscriptions or sell any apps or anything like that.

102
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:40,640
So you know, if you like what you hear, all we ask is that you spread the word.

103
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,400
We say that at the end of every show.

104
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,320
And winning the award would be great for promotion.

105
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:49,000
And not just us, but the network we're on, it would be terrific.

106
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,140
We won the award back in 2005 when podcasting was like first, first out there.

107
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,680
And it was great promotion then.

108
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,400
But since then, a lot of corporate casts have come in and really just dominated, because

109
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,200
you know, they can put ads in their magazines and they get millions of visitors on their

110
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,200
sites.

111
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:10,080
So us lowly independents, you know, have struggled a lot to promote amongst that.

112
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,980
Now there's a lot of great independent shows nominated.

113
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:12,980
So I'm feeling pretty good.

114
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,840
At least some deserving independent will win.

115
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,860
But of course, we'd like it to be us, I'm not going to lie.

116
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:26,640
So please, if you enjoy Orange Lounge Radio, consider voting for us in the podcast awards.

117
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,360
Dark Sakura will be back next week too.

118
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:32,040
I had a little note to mention that for those that are Dark Sakura fans.

119
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,240
We will still have a classic game of the week and all that fun stuff tonight.

120
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,240
So stay tuned.

121
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:39,600
I want to talk about this story too before we get into the gaming weeks and the news

122
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,600
and all that.

123
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,320
And that is this interesting way that gaming maybe is changing.

124
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,920
This little kind of like blink and you miss it story came up this week and it was about

125
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,920
FIFA 12.

126
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:52,040
And especially for a lot of the people in our audience, I know we don't have as many

127
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:56,240
sports games fans, you know, because I know a lot of you guys, we started with music games,

128
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,560
a lot of you in role playing games, some of that too.

129
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,560
But certainly there's the occasional sports game that we all enjoy.

130
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:08,880
You know, for me, the old NBA Jam, Blades of Steel, a lot of the old school stuff.

131
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,800
But what I think is interesting about this whole FIFA 12 thing is that you can play FIFA

132
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:18,360
12, at least a demo of it, right, via YouTube.

133
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:23,080
And I guess it's like a partnership that this company Gaikai is doing with YouTube where

134
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:27,080
you go on and you can go to this page to visit, you know, information about FIFA 12 and you

135
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,500
can actually stream this demo.

136
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,340
You don't download anything to your computer or what have you.

137
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:33,340
It's like OnLife.

138
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:37,320
This is basically an OnLife competitor but no standalone client.

139
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,560
I guess it's all run through Java or what have you.

140
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:45,600
So you can go on, check out this game, and stream it and all the graphics and everything

141
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,240
through the magic of the cloud gaming and all that stuff so you're not really downloading

142
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,080
a whole lot to your computer.

143
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,640
And while this might not seem like such a big deal at first, I kind of go like, okay,

144
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,360
well, hold on a minute.

145
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:06,520
If this is going on YouTube, which is how we watch a lot of like movies and music videos

146
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,480
now, I mean, does MTV play music videos anymore?

147
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,480
No.

148
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,480
Sometimes.

149
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,480
Where do we get our music videos?

150
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,080
I think they have a show that does that.

151
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,880
Like one show that comes on at midnight?

152
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,880
All right.

153
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,080
Beavis and Butthead is coming back this week.

154
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,720
So that's old school.

155
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,600
That is awesome.

156
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,600
But what does this mean?

157
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,660
Do you think this could mean anything for the future of gaming?

158
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:31,020
Because now we've got two companies that are going into cloud gaming and later on tonight

159
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:35,820
we're going to get into rumors about the Xbox and whatever next is for them and then PlayStation

160
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:36,820
4.

161
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:37,820
What?

162
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:40,480
I mean, could this be technology that we see built into consoles?

163
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:44,280
Is this something that's going to go wider, do you think?

164
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:49,160
This kind of reminds me of that vaporware console that was announced around the time

165
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:53,680
the 360 and the PS3 were, which was, I believe the Phantom, if you remember that, where you

166
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,680
could sign up to sign up to get the preliminary launch announcement.

167
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,680
I do remember that.

168
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,080
And I think that's why a lot of people kind of laughed on live when it first came out.

169
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,080
Yeah.

170
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,080
And then I remember going to that E3.

171
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,640
Were you at that E3 Loki or was that the year after you went?

172
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,640
Yeah.

173
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,640
Okay.

174
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:12,560
Remember when on live was there on the floor and it was like, holy shit, it works.

175
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,600
Like a lot of people were like, okay, wait, where's the box?

176
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,600
What's the trick?

177
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,800
And like, that was really people's reaction to on live is holy shit, it works.

178
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,100
Now on live's biggest challenge is getting the games on the service.

179
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:26,320
You know, they don't really have a lot unfortunately, but it works.

180
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:29,940
But yeah, the Phantom and all that kind of, it wasn't so much skeptical.

181
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:34,480
It wasn't so much a gaming console as it was a gaming appliance, but that didn't really

182
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,960
seem like, you know, there was no way to actually load media onto it.

183
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:41,060
It was all kind of DS DLC or all streaming.

184
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:44,280
And that seems like, well, why can't you just do that on a computer once they can figure

185
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:47,120
out the parity between the bandwidth and the response time?

186
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,360
And it sounds like it's here.

187
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,360
So yeah.

188
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,360
I bet.

189
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,000
Do you think this is something that we could see?

190
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,820
I mean, you know, right now we have X-Box live arcade where you download these little

191
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:58,040
games to the console and your PlayStation network.

192
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:01,720
Do you think there's going to come a time where we stream games services?

193
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,720
Yeah, absolutely.

194
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,160
Because I mean, as bandwidth gets better, it's going to get even easier to stream something

195
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,480
like that.

196
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,280
And I mean, they're only a couple hundred meg at most.

197
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:17,100
I mean, well, some of them are like a couple gig, but you know, they have limits in size

198
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:20,840
and stuff to what they can put on X-Box live arcade.

199
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,320
So it would be possible to stream something like that.

200
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:28,000
Or if they have a way to where they could split the game up, you know, by level or whatever

201
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,400
so that you start streaming the game and as you progress through the game, you have the

202
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,480
rest of the levels are streaming in, then yeah, definitely it's something they could

203
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,480
do.

204
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:42,040
Plus, you know, with all the announcements like a couple weeks ago where, you know, both

205
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:50,840
Unreal's now being supported in web browsers and you know, also Crytek is looking at getting

206
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:54,800
the CryEngine in, you know, to Flash as well.

207
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:59,800
So you know, with that stuff coming about, yeah, I can definitely see them doing a lot

208
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:04,720
more gaming on demand type stuff through web browsers because I mean, that way you don't

209
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,080
even have to sell a console.

210
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,580
So that could be kind of bad news for consoles actually, if you think about it.

211
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:13,200
Could you imagine in the future, I mean, this might be actually a horrible thing, but maybe

212
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,200
we're already there.

213
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,200
I don't know.

214
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,780
But remember how like we would go to arcades?

215
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:21,920
Remember the arcade when they weren't full of ticket machines, we would go there to like

216
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,480
play against people and stuff.

217
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:29,760
I mean, what about a system where you deposit a virtual quarter or a token and play a game

218
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,360
streaming against, you know, play around a SoulCalibur 2 or I guess now it would be 5

219
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,840
against somebody long distance.

220
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,820
I mean, I think we're kind of already there.

221
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:42,520
That will work and here's why, it's because they've tried that already with like the IOS

222
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,520
stuff.

223
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:47,560
You have, you know, the Capcom games where you can pay a quarter to play an arcade game

224
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:52,020
on, you know, a handheld system or something like that and people are like, no, I'm not

225
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,020
going to do that.

226
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:57,860
Yeah, and IOS also sucks for gaming unless the game is built around the touchscreen.

227
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:02,320
Even if it was, you know, on my computer and I had a controller and stuff like that, I

228
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,520
would not pay per game.

229
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,020
No, screw that.

230
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:07,320
I bought the game.

231
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,320
I'm going to play the game.

232
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,480
But you used to play 50 cents per round of DDR.

233
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,120
Yeah, and that's a little bit different.

234
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,120
Or a dollar, shit.

235
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,960
Are they going to ship me some pads and ship me a nice arcade system?

236
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:22,240
Then yeah, well, I'll consider it then, but it's not like that.

237
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:27,280
You're using all my hardware and all you're doing is sending me the code for your game.

238
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:30,400
Well, it's being, it's being rendered offsite though, right?

239
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,560
It's just being streamed to you.

240
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,680
Like you don't need the graphics card or anything, right?

241
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,680
It's in the cloud.

242
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:40,400
It's all in the cloud through the magic of the cloud.

243
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,400
You know, I don't like the cloud.

244
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,400
You know what?

245
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,400
Fuck the cloud.

246
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,400
Is that what you're saying?

247
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,400
Fuck the cloud.

248
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,400
Yeah.

249
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:52,480
He was Final Fantasy's best antagonist and I don't know why, no, I'm kidding.

250
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,720
You know, it's kind of, you know, also kind of this whole discussion about arcades and

251
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:59,540
things makes you think, and it makes me kind of sad is that are we ever going to have anything

252
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:01,120
like DDR ever again?

253
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,720
And I don't mean like the game itself, but I mean kind of like the community that that

254
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:10,360
built, which includes this show, which started nine years ago, guitar hero and rock band,

255
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,360
right?

256
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,360
And that's even, that's kind of came and went.

257
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,360
That's not what I mean though.

258
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,640
I'm talking about we used to go to the arcade to celebrate people's birthdays and sit around

259
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,720
the fourth mix machine and watch people fuck off.

260
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,360
The problem is it's not profitable as much for arcades anymore to have that kind of stuff

261
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,760
in their arcades.

262
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:31,180
So you, what you need to do is you need to have arcades that really just want that there

263
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:34,200
and find a way to become profitable as well.

264
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:38,440
How do you get people to leave the couch when it's so easy now to click button play game?

265
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:42,520
Well, I think it's, I mean, you still can't emulate everything that you can do in the

266
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,520
arcade.

267
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:47,880
I mean, the experiences in the arcade are still going to be vastly superior as far as,

268
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,960
you know, controls go.

269
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:53,400
I mean, arcade sticks and stuff like that, yeah, definitely supplement that, but not

270
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,440
everyone's buying that and it's still, you know, fun to play in the arcade.

271
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:00,640
But the problem is, yeah, a lot of people are playing stuff that they could play in

272
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:04,800
the arcade at home, like fighting games and racing games and stuff like that.

273
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,440
But yeah, dancing games and stuff, I don't think that's really something you can emulate

274
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,440
at home.

275
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,440
Yeah.

276
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,440
You know, they've danced in revolution.

277
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,000
I'm not even necessarily talking about a dancing game or a music game.

278
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,800
I'm just talking about a game that establishes such a sense of community.

279
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,200
The closest thing I can think of that I see now is maybe like some of the racing games.

280
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:23,800
Like, I do still see, like, Initial D has a pretty big contingent in the racing games

281
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,800
in the arcade.

282
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,800
There's, there's...

283
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,760
Fighting, of course fighting games, of course fighting games.

284
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,760
There's still communities.

285
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,760
But it's not as big as it used to be.

286
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,560
Well, there's still communities out there, but they're spread out or they're, you know,

287
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,160
on Facebook or something like that.

288
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:40,480
I mean, go to any, you know, gaming Facebook page and there's tons of people that are fans

289
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,300
of that game on there talking about stuff.

290
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:47,680
You know, if you want to get people excited about something at the arcade, you make it

291
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:53,200
arcade only, you make a reason for people to go there constantly, just, you know, whether

292
00:13:53,200 --> 00:14:01,440
it be, you know, unlocking stuff on the machine or just some unique style of gameplay and

293
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,440
people will go there.

294
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:06,460
People will be, you know, have fun, create communities around it.

295
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:10,960
It's just, unfortunately, you know, like Dance Dance Revolution started really much as an

296
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:16,480
arcade game and yeah, there were some of the Japanese versions, but for a long time, that's

297
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,200
all there was, was the arcade and that's why people would go there and then they formed

298
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,200
a community around it.

299
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,240
But then once they started coming out with a lot more home versions, yeah, you don't

300
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,160
really necessarily need to go to the arcade anymore.

301
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,920
Yeah, but the home versions had crap songs for the longest time.

302
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:29,920
Yes, that's true.

303
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,360
But then also a lot of the people grew up and they just decided.

304
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,360
We all turned 30.

305
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,360
Shit.

306
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,440
They just decided, you know, I've got a lot more things going on.

307
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:42,280
I can't really make it out to the arcade to go play games.

308
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:49,920
I mean, it's just, you know, time, you know, do I go drive, you know, 10 minutes, 15 minutes

309
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:55,000
or whatever to my arcade to go hang out by myself, you know, or.

310
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,340
I think my, my mind was kind of going in this direction because I'd heard something, well,

311
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:03,120
a DDR Freak officially closed this week.

312
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,320
I mean, I know we had the talk a couple of weeks ago about how DDR Freak was closing

313
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,880
and the server was offline, but the server came back up for J-Dog to post a message that

314
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:14,680
said it's over, like the whole epilogue and the forums are locked down because of spam

315
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,680
and everything.

316
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,680
It is officially done.

317
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,680
Game over.

318
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,680
Failed.

319
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,680
You know, that whole thing.

320
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,680
So I don't know.

321
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:21,920
It kind of had me thinking about the whole DDR and the community and all that because,

322
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,920
you know, it was shit.

323
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,400
We've been playing that game like 10 years.

324
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:29,040
Yeah, but there's, that was one site and that's like kind of what it was.

325
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,040
Let's be real.

326
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,040
I get it.

327
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,200
DDR is not dead and you know, it will always be a fitness school type thing, whatever.

328
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,480
But like DDR Freak was the community for a long time.

329
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:42,560
It was a community for a long time and then like 10 years ago it stopped being the community

330
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:48,280
where everyone went and there's other communities out there and those communities are still

331
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,760
live and just doing fine.

332
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,920
You know, I'd heard rumors about speaking of arcades, communities, all that, the rumors

333
00:15:53,920 --> 00:16:00,100
about a DDR get together for the 20th of November, which I think is supposed to be a Sunday,

334
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:03,040
but I haven't heard anything about if that's actually happening or not, but I think it

335
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,040
should.

336
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:07,720
I mean, if they're not going to organize something, I think we should.

337
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,720
I don't know.

338
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,720
I'll just have to, I'll have to find out and find out fast.

339
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,720
That's only what?

340
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,720
Like four weeks away?

341
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,720
Something like that.

342
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,280
So don't have a lot of time.

343
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,280
There's no time.

344
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,280
All right.

345
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,520
Uh, let's move on.

346
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:23,520
Um, let me get a couple more comments from our chat room at chat.orangelandsready.com.

347
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:27,560
Derek H I think is trying to play this FIFA demo online and brings up an interesting point

348
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,040
about just how easy this all is.

349
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,520
Derek H says, this FIFA thing is stalled at starting game.

350
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,700
Please wait a moment.

351
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,800
Now I got to upgrade Java and the download failed.

352
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:39,040
I think it would have been faster if they just let me download the demo.

353
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,360
I don't like guy guy.

354
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,200
And um, that's a pretty good point.

355
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,560
You know, as simple as this all might be, push button play game.

356
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:50,800
Doesn't always work.

357
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,080
It's not always that easy.

358
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:57,240
And really, I mean, yeah, the technology is cool and it might be fun to check it out because

359
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,760
of the technology, but I don't give a crap about FIFA.

360
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,600
I just don't.

361
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,520
And I figure, you know, if I'm going to play a FIFA demo, I have a 360, I can download

362
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,560
the demo for that, but it's FIFA now, but it might be another game later on that you

363
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,560
are interested in.

364
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,560
Right?

365
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,560
Yeah.

366
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:15,860
I think the genre of games that really stands out to me is that could really take advantage

367
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:20,520
of this are free to play MMOs where you don't have to bog down your system with a bunch

368
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,600
of crap to install it.

369
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,800
You just log into a portal and it's all streamed to you because that's a great way to get the

370
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,320
soccer moms or whatever to play because they don't need a graphics card.

371
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,840
It's all rendered off site.

372
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:34,920
So free MMOs and game demos, I could see really taking advantage of this, but for the kind

373
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:38,440
of games that we like to play, I don't know, like Arkham City or whatever, you're going

374
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:43,440
to need an installation on a local device, whether it's a console or PC, but I think

375
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,520
for free, for free MMOs or freemium, this is great technology.

376
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:52,480
All right, well, we're going to move on into our gaming weeks and the stuff that we've

377
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,480
been playing this week.

378
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,480
A couple other quick, quick announcements.

379
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,720
I forgot to get this out there earlier, but I see some of you guys in chat room are like,

380
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,160
I'm voting in the podcast awards.

381
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,160
Okay.

382
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,160
So thank you guys so much for doing that.

383
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:05,200
I did want to mention one of the other members of the OL army, Brad from pod culture has

384
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,000
a show in his network that's nominated and we want to throw our support behind him.

385
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,400
He is with a show called the geek spin and it's nominated in pod safe music.

386
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,280
I think it might just be called music in the awards.

387
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,280
I can't remember.

388
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,840
It's either pod safe, it's pod safe.

389
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,960
Loki's been voting for it every day.

390
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,580
So it's, it's the geek spin.

391
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:23,240
And so, you know, as you're filling out your ballot, cause you can vote in one category,

392
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:27,040
you can vote multiple, we would, you know, unless there's just some other pod safe music

393
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,440
podcasts you just really freaking love.

394
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,080
We'd appreciate if you'd throw your support to a fellow member of the OL army.

395
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,680
If we can't win, maybe he can, that would be pretty cool.

396
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,260
I think that was it.

397
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:40,840
So let's move on to our gaming weeks and the video games that you have been playing this

398
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:41,840
week.

399
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,200
Salacious Pop, we'll start with you.

400
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,800
Mostly world of Warcraft, of course.

401
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,280
And I guessed it on your other podcast to talk about that.

402
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:54,220
So we'll get to it in a minute, but obviously lots of big world of Warcraft news came out.

403
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,520
So I played a lot of that.

404
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,960
It's in the middle of the Halloween holiday.

405
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:03,920
I also had an opportunity to play on the PS3, your Sega Genesis arcade collection.

406
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:08,840
I was playing a lot of Dr. Robotnik's Bean Bean Machine because someone had commented

407
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:14,220
on how fucking hard that game is because I know it's, it's a licensed clone of POPO.

408
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,280
It's not really our Puyo Puyo.

409
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,280
It's not really rip off.

410
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,720
They, they just reskinned it with their permission.

411
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,720
Yeah.

412
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,080
That and Kirby's Avalanche came out at the same time.

413
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,760
So I don't know if the same company had done them or what the deal is, but yeah.

414
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,760
Yeah.

415
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:30,800
And that is, I got to the fourth or fifth stage, you know, with only having to do each

416
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:35,660
retry like once or twice, but yeah, that game is hard and the Streets of Rage 2 and a bunch

417
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:37,660
of other stuff.

418
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:41,380
And uh, isn't that game a really good deal for like 20 bucks because that's what it goes

419
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,620
for now is 20 bucks.

420
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:45,560
Just a little mini rant because I know you like those.

421
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:50,380
What I love about the Genesis, the Sonic's best of Genesis collection is that there is

422
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:55,460
some production and polish in how it looks when you load up the disc, but it's mostly

423
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,420
just a list.

424
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:59,660
Here are the ROMs that are on this.

425
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:03,420
Here's a nice, pretty, you know, background screen to list everything out in.

426
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:07,260
And then you just pick the game that you want and it loads up.

427
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:14,700
Unlike another collection that we had an opportunity to play, which was the Namco, uh, the Namco

428
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:20,540
Museum Megamix, where you load that up and you play a little 3D Pac-Man avatar and you

429
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:24,440
have to jump over little platforms to get to the building that the ROM that you want

430
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,440
to play it in.

431
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,340
By the way, I looked at game FAQs, like you remember how there's all those power pellets

432
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:31,940
everywhere and it's like, Ooh, I wonder what game you unlock if you eat them all, right?

433
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:34,300
I looked on a game FAQ to see what you get.

434
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,300
Nothing.

435
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,300
It's all for show.

436
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,300
It is.

437
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,300
It means nothing.

438
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:42,940
And maybe I'm just an old curmudgeon now, but I know there's a lot of controversy about

439
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:47,820
repackaging retro content for a $40 disc when it's just shit that you played when you were

440
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:53,420
15 or however young, you know, in the nineties on your Sega Genesis, releasing that content

441
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,420
on a disc.

442
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,420
Just give me a menu.

443
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:59,340
Show me that you put some effort into packaging it and just let me, just let me pick it from

444
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:00,340
a list.

445
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:01,340
I'm easy to please.

446
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:04,020
You know, and if they want to do the frou-frou stuff, fine, but they should have like an

447
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,020
easy way.

448
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:09,020
And another thing I liked about the Genesis collection was that versus the Namco Megamix,

449
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:14,060
the Genesis collection has the extra interviews, it has arcade games you can unlock.

450
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:18,340
There's things that you can work towards that aren't like just, you know, too distracting

451
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,340
or terrible.

452
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:20,340
You know what I mean?

453
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:21,340
Yeah.

454
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:22,340
So yeah.

455
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:25,920
So loading up the Namco museum and direct Pac-Man to find the game that you want that's

456
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,600
in one of these candy shaped buildings.

457
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,700
There's also one other big difference between the Megamix and the Sega Genesis collection

458
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:32,700
to be fair.

459
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,660
And that is that they have all these new versions of games.

460
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:40,760
Like one of the ones I played was Rally-X, which has now Pac-Man in the car dodging,

461
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:45,540
not ghosts, but just boogers, just boogers and other cars.

462
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:49,620
And it's kind of like a 3D version of Rally-X, which kind of ruins the charm of the original

463
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:50,620
game.

464
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:56,860
Like old school 2D games from 1983 don't translate well into 3D on the Wii if you don't change

465
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:57,860
a lot.

466
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:58,860
You know what I mean?

467
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:02,020
Like it's just, the whole thing felt derpy to me.

468
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:05,900
And I want to give a shout out to a DDR dollar bill in chat because he said that his gaming

469
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:13,100
week with City of Heroes and they just launched their freemium free to play model, which included

470
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:17,140
the cataclysm like redesign of the starter zones.

471
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:19,000
Maybe a minor graphical upgrade.

472
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,020
So I'm not really in a situation where I can check that out right now, but I'm just City

473
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,020
of Heroes love.

474
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,020
I played that game for years.

475
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,020
I'm surprised.

476
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,020
Why aren't you getting into that?

477
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:28,020
Is it just too much?

478
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,020
Wow.

479
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,020
Or it's free.

480
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,020
It runs on your computer, right?

481
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,020
Yeah.

482
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,860
I'm surprised you're not checking it out.

483
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:37,140
Let me ask you this question too before you wrap up your gaming week because unlike the

484
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:41,060
other show, the people that listen to this show, not everybody's into WoW.

485
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:43,540
In fact, some people quite frankly hate it.

486
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:46,060
So why do you play WoW?

487
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:50,700
Well, what got me onto WoW originally was finding out how many gamer friends that I

488
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:55,120
never really got to see in FaceTime were already playing on a certain server and it was the

489
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,980
social aspect of it.

490
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:02,940
So being able to interact with people that I know and it's very immersive.

491
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:04,580
There's definitely stuff to do.

492
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:07,820
It's the industry leader for subscriptions for a reason even though that's dwindling

493
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:10,940
which we'll get to in a minute with a future story.

494
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:17,500
But I played the hell out of Warcraft 3 and I knew I played the RTS campaign where the

495
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:20,220
Scourge is there and Lich King and blah, blah, blah.

496
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:25,740
So I didn't hop onto the WoW train immediately because I was still playing City of Heroes

497
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,700
to be honest, so.

498
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:28,700
Alright.

499
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:29,700
Loki!

500
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:30,700
Oh, I'm sorry.

501
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,220
I'm assuming that was everything, right?

502
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:33,220
Yes.

503
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:34,220
Okay.

504
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,220
Loki, how was your gaming week?

505
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,220
I only played Grand Theft Auto.

506
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:37,220
That's it?

507
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,580
Yeah, it's pretty much it.

508
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:41,700
I didn't get in time to play much of anything else.

509
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:50,780
I don't think I played any Dead Rising 2 off the record this week.

510
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:53,780
Gosh, you make it sound like you have a baby or something that takes all your time.

511
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:57,420
Uh, no, actually it wasn't the baby that took all my time, it was modding Grand Theft Auto

512
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:58,420
that took all my time.

513
00:23:58,420 --> 00:23:59,420
Modding Grand Theft Auto?

514
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:00,420
What are you doing to Grand Theft Auto right now?

515
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:08,100
Uh, just discovering new stuff, new techniques on how to do things, and uh, that really occupied

516
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,100
all my time.

517
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:11,440
Alright, um, let's see.

518
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:16,780
My gaming week, I was playing Warcraft as well because you guys all know I'm into that.

519
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:20,660
Final Fantasy XIV, I'm still kind of juggling the two games a little bit, you know, and

520
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:23,140
I stand by what I said about the game last week.

521
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:26,140
It's getting better, but there's still a lot of room for improvement and I'm probably not

522
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:30,580
going to pay for it unless some miracle patch makes the game really.

523
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:36,100
And I think a lot of what is ruining Final Fantasy XIV for me the more I play it is that

524
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:42,180
I see how other MMOs, including WoW, like to put in a lot of quality of life improvements,

525
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:47,300
but I feel like the Japanese developers have no concept of what a quality of life improvement

526
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,300
is.

527
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,940
I mean, I'm talking about like games I see developed over there versus games I see developed

528
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:51,940
over here.

529
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:56,140
It is that, you know, in order to do certain quests and stuff, I spend ten minutes running

530
00:24:56,140 --> 00:25:01,260
from point A to point B, and that's just, how is that fun to just run?

531
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:05,020
You know, so I think if they are going to redesign their game, they really need to think

532
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:10,220
about how do we make the game non-stop fun?

533
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:13,940
That's the thing, because when the game's good, it's pretty good.

534
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:17,500
Like you know, the battle systems actually, it's really neat to look at, it's different,

535
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:20,540
you have to think about positioning of your characters as well as what you're doing, you

536
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:24,060
know, it's very much unlike WoW, and I like that, it makes a nice break from WoW, and

537
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:30,940
the storytelling is awesome, and the cutscenes are great, but when the game is in its downtime,

538
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:33,220
it's dead time, it's really dead.

539
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:37,720
You know, if I didn't have a link shell of people to talk to, I would poke my eyes out

540
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:41,500
from boredom, and so I hope the developers are really going to think about how the game

541
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:45,340
can be thrilling for ten minutes as opposed to every ten minutes.

542
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:50,260
It sort of reminds me of the argument of what Japanese gamers want versus American gamers

543
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:55,780
especially with JRPGs and how they're kind of tedious and min-max-y and how they just

544
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:58,940
supposedly love that over there, whereas here we're more...

545
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,540
I kind of think that's a cop-out.

546
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:04,540
Like I don't think people here truly understand what people like over there, and you know,

547
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:05,540
vice versa.

548
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:10,060
Like I think sometimes people make excuses, like, oh it's a cultural thing, it's a cultural

549
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,060
thing.

550
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:12,060
I don't know.

551
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:17,460
Yeah, because I heard that those lineage MMOs, which are huge over in that part of the world,

552
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:22,300
are very kind of dry to play, like the grinding that you have to do.

553
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:24,980
But again, I've never played it, so I'm mostly talking out of my ass, but...

554
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:28,380
And I wonder if it's one of those things again where kind of like you and WoW, you know,

555
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:31,060
your friends are there so you just play it, it's your thing.

556
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:36,060
You know, if all my friends suddenly dropped WoW and went to Final Fantasy XIV, I'd have

557
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:39,820
to reconsider what I'm saying, because at least in my ten minutes of run, run, run,

558
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:43,080
run, run, run, run, run, run, run, all over the place, which is what, when Salacious

559
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,340
Pop sees me playing Final Fantasy XIV, that's what he does.

560
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:49,780
Because you play a little spriteling hobbit halfling little...

561
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:50,780
Lalafell.

562
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:51,780
Lalafell.

563
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:54,540
So it's this cute little munchkin thing, and his little legs kick when he runs, and he

564
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:57,220
does a lot of running to run from town to town.

565
00:26:57,220 --> 00:27:02,860
So I see his little wiggly legs tearing across the countryside, and run, run, run, run, run,

566
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:04,020
run, run, run.

567
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,020
So.

568
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:06,020
Alright.

569
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:07,020
Anyhow.

570
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:10,740
A question from our chat room before I talk about one more game I played this week.

571
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:15,000
Hitstun in our chat room asks, oh yeah, how did Skylander's sales do this week in Dark

572
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Tetsuya?

573
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,260
I was disappointed that Loki didn't play Skylander's this week.

574
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:20,340
So what's up with Skylander's?

575
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:27,420
I don't have any sales data yet, and I was just checking on that, because VG Charts only

576
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:31,480
has up through the 15th, and they came out on the 16th, so there's nothing yet.

577
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,480
So we'll know soon.

578
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:36,700
But based on the report I heard last week from a retail person, I mean, this is one

579
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:39,340
retail person in one store, but it seems to be selling well.

580
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:42,580
But then again, I went to Target, and I saw plenty of copies of the game and all the little

581
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:48,620
dollies, which I gotta admit, there was a moment where I kinda went, oh that might actually

582
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:49,620
be kind of fun.

583
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:55,700
And then I just heard Loki in my brain going, no!

584
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:56,700
Listen.

585
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,860
Uh oh.

586
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:01,740
Do I have to explain to you what this game is?

587
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:06,660
You don't, but for the behalf of the listeners who would love to hear you explain it, please.

588
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:08,420
Okay, well here's how it is.

589
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,740
This whole game is just to sell toys.

590
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:12,620
That's all it is.

591
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:16,820
Yeah, it's a neat concept where, you know, it's kind of a hack and slash, reminds me

592
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:20,580
of Gauntlet Legends, you know, that's kinda cool, you know, I like it.

593
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:21,980
Gauntlet Legends is pretty badass.

594
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:24,660
It's a pretty badass game, you know, that's awesome.

595
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:28,460
I didn't need to buy little toys to play Gauntlet Legends, so I do appreciate that.

596
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:30,620
But you did need a Dreamcast.

597
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:33,460
Or the arcade.

598
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:35,420
But here's the thing.

599
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:38,300
This game is specifically made to sell toys.

600
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:43,100
I mean, if you don't believe it, play the game.

601
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:45,540
Play the game, okay, seriously.

602
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:52,420
You start off with three figures, and it's three different elements, I guess.

603
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:54,460
There's a total of eight different elements in the game.

604
00:28:54,460 --> 00:29:00,540
In order to see everything in the game, you have to buy all eight elements.

605
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:05,100
And so you only have three characters to start off with, so that's, you know, another $40

606
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:07,600
you gotta spend to see everything that's in the game.

607
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:12,020
Of course, then you also have to buy the expansions to see what's in there as well, so that's

608
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:14,780
another, you know, $40 on top of that.

609
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:16,820
So $80 right there.

610
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:17,820
And if you-

611
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:20,780
But to be fair, I mean, there's a lot of video games that have download content, and if you

612
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:24,020
want to see it all, quote unquote, you know, all the levels and stuff-

613
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:27,580
Okay, that's fair, that a lot of games have download content.

614
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:32,900
But to see everything on the disc, I don't have to spend another $40.

615
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:38,360
Which is, you know, $40 on top of a game that's already too expensive as it is.

616
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:44,460
And then, on top of that, you know, to entice kids to beg their parents for more characters,

617
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:47,740
you can unlock abilities for characters you don't own.

618
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:52,460
And then, it basically shows you a preview video of how awesome that character is and

619
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:54,180
how badly you need it.

620
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,820
And so-

621
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:56,820
It's to get kids.

622
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:57,820
It's to get kids.

623
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:58,820
Mommy, mommy, mommy.

624
00:29:58,820 --> 00:29:59,820
I want, I want, I want.

625
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:00,820
Exactly.

626
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:04,620
I want more fucking targets looking for this figurine for Skylanders, and I can't find

627
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:05,620
it.

628
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:06,620
Right?

629
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:07,620
Because you have to find the toy.

630
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:09,300
And, and, you know, and I see a lot of-

631
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:13,380
Thank God Oprah's not still on, because I could just see her going out to her audience,

632
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:15,500
we're giving you Skylanders!

633
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:20,660
And, and I see a lot of these blogging sites or whatever talking about how expensive it

634
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:25,420
would be to buy everything, and how it's like $300 or something like that.

635
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:27,700
Yeah, you're right, up to a point.

636
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,860
That's wave one.

637
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:32,300
That's just the first fucking, you know, stuff that's available right now.

638
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:34,980
We haven't even talked about, like, stuff that's gonna be wave two or three.

639
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:36,980
Series two, coming spring 2012.

640
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:42,900
Seriously, you think that they're only gonna be limited to just 30 characters or whatever?

641
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:46,100
Oh, you know, you are wrong, sir.

642
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,940
Gotta catch them all.

643
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:50,740
Going to our chat room, and I apologize if I'm mispronouncing this name, I think it's

644
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:51,740
Zezby?

645
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:52,740
Zeezby?

646
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:57,060
Uh, in our chat room, uh, says, my mom bought this for my eight-year-old brother for his

647
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:58,060
birthday.

648
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:59,300
I tried to get her to return it.

649
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:02,580
I then cried because she is now a tool and I can't prevent it.

650
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:03,580
Well, here's the thing.

651
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:06,260
I don't have a problem with people buying download content for the game.

652
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:09,940
If this was, say, for example, a game that didn't have any toys whatsoever, and they

653
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:15,020
had a total of 30 characters, but each one cost a buck on, you know, the PlayStation

654
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:19,860
or, yeah, that would still be stupid, but buying a character for a dollar, not that

655
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:20,860
bad.

656
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:26,260
Buying a stupid inanimate object that's $8 and it doesn't do anything, and I saw a lot

657
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:32,340
of, like, you know, Kotaku, gotta love them, but, you know, one of their excuses is, well,

658
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:33,500
see, these toys are awesome!

659
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:37,140
My kids are playing chess with them!

660
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:38,140
Your kids are weird.

661
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:39,700
You can play chess with a Dixie Cup.

662
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:40,700
Exactly!

663
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,300
You can play chess with anything!

664
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,540
You can play chess with the pieces that come with it!

665
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:45,580
Oh my God!

666
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:46,580
That's just amazing!

667
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:53,540
Um, yeah, so, good for you that your kids have found, you know, ways to use your toys

668
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:59,860
that you got for free from Activision anyways, so congratulations, but it's just, it's seriously

669
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:04,260
a cash grab, and if it's successful, you can bet that there's gonna be more of this shit

670
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,260
later on.

671
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:08,940
I don't need another 30 minute opening segment about Skylanders, so can I move on and talk

672
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,260
about the last game of my week?

673
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:14,980
Let's talk about Cash Grab 2, bargain basement game that's pretty good for your value, and

674
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:18,540
it's seriously right up the frickin' alley of the people that listen to this show, at

675
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:21,980
least the ones, you know, that started with us and all that, because it's a music-based

676
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:22,980
game.

677
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:26,740
The game I bought this week on Steam, that just went on sale, I believe, over the weekend,

678
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:34,140
is a game called Sequence, and it is, get this, it's a DDR role-playing game.

679
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:39,380
It's DDR, but not like the actual DDR game, but it's that whole idea, the falling arrows,

680
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:44,120
mixed with a role-playing game, and it's $4.50 right now on Steam, which I think the regular

681
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,120
price is gonna be $5.

682
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:48,540
I also believe, if I remember correctly, it's also an Xbox indie game.

683
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:49,540
It is.

684
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:54,540
It's not live indie game, but once the Cthulhu people went over to Steam and were like, shit,

685
00:32:54,540 --> 00:33:00,740
we made more money in a day on Steam, I'm sure Sequence was probably already in negotiations

686
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:04,940
to get their game on Steam, and fine, because, I don't know, I wanted to play it on my computer,

687
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:05,940
and I just, I did.

688
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:06,940
I bought it there.

689
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:09,340
And so, okay, let me try to explain the setup for you guys.

690
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:16,420
So imagine if you had three Dance Dance Revolution play fields that you had to play all at once,

691
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:19,180
and you would use buttons to switch between the play fields.

692
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:21,500
So Rock Band for the DS or the PSP.

693
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:26,900
Okay, kind of, I guess you could say, except, like, one won't stop just because you get

694
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,500
a perfect note pattern in one.

695
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:31,380
One of them is for defending or preventing damage.

696
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,980
One of them is for casting spells.

697
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:35,440
One of them is for regening mana for your spells.

698
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,940
And the way it all works together, I gotta admit, is really cool.

699
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:43,140
Like, the whole design of the game is, it's something kinda new.

700
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:48,020
It's mixing two genres together that I think people are into, and I think for people that

701
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:52,620
enjoy music games or old playing games, like, you've gotta see what they've done here.

702
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:56,640
It is a $5 game, and so it has the production values of a $5 game.

703
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:01,540
Some of the voice acting is a little, leaves some things to be desired.

704
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,900
But the writing is actually, it's very witty.

705
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:07,700
It's a very witty, you can tell there's a lot of inspiration from, like, GLaDOS.

706
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:11,220
It's very modern, the game.

707
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:13,620
So I like kinda what they've done with that.

708
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:17,140
And it's not that, I'm not, like, criticizing the voice actors, I'm just saying the way

709
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:21,280
the voice acting is delivered, it really sounds like the two were recorded, like, at least

710
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:27,100
in the stages I've played, the intercom gal and the main character that you play, it's

711
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:31,360
kinda obvious the two were recorded separately, because they don't ever talk on top of each

712
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,360
other.

713
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:34,540
They don't have a natural interaction with each other.

714
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:38,180
And maybe I'm just kinda picky when it comes to stuff like that, but I just, you know,

715
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:39,900
I noticed it.

716
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:43,260
But I'm not gonna say, like, oh my god, the game is, like, worthless because the voice

717
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:46,180
acting was not done professionally.

718
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:52,500
No, it's the game itself, it's neat, and it's the kinda thing where I go, I really wanna

719
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:55,580
see what they're gonna do with this sequel.

720
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:59,660
Because you know, again, when I say roleplaying game, unfortunately there's no overworld,

721
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:03,260
there's no map, it's just you kinda choose from a menu.

722
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:05,340
Do you wanna go out and battle another creature?

723
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:09,560
Do you wanna work on synthesis to get more items so you are, you know, better defended

724
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,820
and have more hit points?

725
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:15,940
Or do you wanna work on, you know, what kinda stuff do you wanna do from within this room?

726
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:19,940
So I feel like with this concept, there's so much more that can be done with it if people

727
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:22,220
will just throw money at it.

728
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:27,100
If somebody will invest and get them more help, it'll be great.

729
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:30,400
So like, sequence two I think will be really cool if they end up making one.

730
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,020
But sequence one is worth your time.

731
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:35,220
The only other thing I guess I could say that might be a slight bit of a negative is that

732
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:42,080
the music is not, you know, it's not gonna be DDR style music, but I did like the music.

733
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:47,780
It's kinda, you know, it's not really like pop music or anything like that.

734
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:53,620
It's very like video gamey, you know, kinda indie artist type stuff, but it's not bad

735
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:54,620
by any means.

736
00:35:54,620 --> 00:36:00,420
And you know, because my brain is still preoccupied, I tell you, it takes a lot to like be thinking

737
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:04,380
in the concept of, okay, I'm playing over here and oh shit, I see an arrow coming down

738
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:07,380
here on the damage, so I gotta flip over, hit that one, then I gotta go back and hit

739
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:08,380
my arrows to cast a spell.

740
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:11,140
I mean, your brain is kinda thinking all these things that you're not really absorbing the

741
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:12,860
music like you would in DDR.

742
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:13,860
So I don't know.

743
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:16,940
But yeah, I really like the setup of the game.

744
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:20,660
So it's neat and I would check it out if you have 450 to spare.

745
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:24,500
Sadly, I don't think there's a demo, but there might be on the indie games marketplace.

746
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:29,580
I would assume there's something there on Xbox Live, but again, I played it on PC.

747
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:30,740
So check it out.

748
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:32,660
That's sequence.

749
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:35,920
Alright, that does it for our gaming weeks.

750
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:39,620
So I wanna quickly plug a few Orange Lounge Radio related things and that would be our

751
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:40,620
Facebook.

752
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:43,300
If you're not our friend on Facebook, why not?

753
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:44,660
Don't you wanna have another friend?

754
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:48,860
Orange Lounge Radio, Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio is the place to add us on Facebook.

755
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:52,260
You can also follow us on the Twitters, Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

756
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:56,960
We will be taking your Twitter comments a little later on in the show, Twitter.com slash

757
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:01,340
O-L-R if you wanna send us some app messages with your thoughts on anything, sorry, Loki,

758
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:04,420
anything you're hearing about on tonight's program.

759
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:06,700
Let's get into some news.

760
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:09,240
Loki's gonna start us off tonight.

761
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:14,580
So the PlayStation Vita's got a release date now for Europe and North America and I guess

762
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:17,060
the Middle East and Australia.

763
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:18,060
February 22nd.

764
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:23,620
It's kinda hot, that's a Wednesday on release date, but yeah.

765
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:24,620
It'll be coming out.

766
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:31,940
Of course, they are quick to remind you that it's $249.99 without 3G and $299.99 with 3G.

767
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:39,700
Honestly, I'd just stick without 3G and tether to my phone if I really want 3G, although

768
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:41,020
I don't think I'll ever.

769
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:45,220
But Loki, I must game on the go.

770
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:48,500
I mean, it's a good idea if you want to do 3G.

771
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:54,420
I just don't know what the data plans are with that and 3G stuff, you know, have they

772
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:55,620
really announced?

773
00:37:55,620 --> 00:38:00,860
Is this something where I can take it to any provider that has 3G and say, hey, I want

774
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:09,100
my PlayStation Vita to run on your service, because this isn't like the iPhone or anything

775
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:13,900
where hey, certain places will give it to you.

776
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:16,980
And also, the other thing you might want to wait and see is if they do have some sort

777
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:22,420
of data plan, a lot of times usually with the iPads and phones and stuff like that,

778
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:26,380
they'll offer you some sort of discount on the system, so you might want to wait and

779
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:31,140
see what the providers announce.

780
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:35,660
Some new launch titles have also been announced, coming from Namco, of course.

781
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:42,300
Ridge Racer, Ridge Racer, serving the launches of systems since the beginning of time.

782
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:48,940
Shinobidou and Touch My Katamari.

783
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:51,900
Those will be coming alongside the Vita in North America.

784
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,300
Touch My Katamari, really?

785
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:59,900
Yeah, I believe that's actually coming out already, well, obviously the Vita is launching

786
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:04,780
a little bit earlier in Japan, but I believe it's also with their launch as well.

787
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:07,500
Is that a bowling minigame I see there?

788
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,820
I don't think it's a minigame, I think it's just bowling pins.

789
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:11,140
Part of what you roll up?

790
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,140
Roll up.

791
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:13,140
That's cute.

792
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:14,700
I like Katamari.

793
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:16,340
I play that.

794
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:21,980
Yeah, I mean, the Katamari franchise has been kind of meh ever since the creator left, but

795
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:28,980
I don't know, you never know, there might always be that Renaissance Katamari game that's

796
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:30,180
a lot of fun again.

797
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:33,980
The one on PlayStation 3 wasn't bad, but it was also kind of a rehash of all the old games.

798
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:36,900
It was like a Best Hits of Katamari.

799
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:41,860
Knowing Namco, I wouldn't be surprised if this is a rehash of a rehash of a rehash of

800
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:45,340
a rehash.

801
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:47,140
So who knows?

802
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:51,140
But it's kind of neat.

803
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:52,740
Do you think you're going to get one of these at launch?

804
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:53,740
I know I am.

805
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:55,380
I really don't have a choice.

806
00:39:55,380 --> 00:40:00,140
I'd like to, but it all depends on how much money you got, but I think I could probably

807
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:02,620
scrounge up that kind of dough.

808
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:05,500
I will definitely be setting the money aside to get it.

809
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,020
I gotta have it.

810
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:10,540
I just, you know, the reason I want it is because I think they're going to do a Grand

811
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:15,180
Theft Auto game for it, and I gotta have a Grand Theft Auto game.

812
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:18,660
Grand Theft Auto on PSP, we were kind of talking about it, especially since they've

813
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:23,500
been showing the Grand Theft Auto 3 stuff, it's like, man, it'd be fun to go back and

814
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:30,300
play Liberty City Stories again, but that game is really old, and it would be such a

815
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:31,980
learning curve again.

816
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:36,180
Salacious Pop, how do you feel about the PlayStation Vita?

817
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:40,420
Like, I know you don't exactly probably want to run out and buy one day one, but let's

818
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:43,260
say you had the disposable income.

819
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:45,580
Is this something that calls to you?

820
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:46,580
Absolutely.

821
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:47,580
It's a sexy piece of hardware.

822
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:48,580
I like how it looks.

823
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:52,460
I didn't know you felt so strongly about it.

824
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:53,460
No, it's like...

825
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:56,820
Do you have feelings for the PlayStation Vita?

826
00:40:56,820 --> 00:41:02,420
The PSP for me was, I think it's an underrated piece of hardware, because the DS, of course,

827
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:07,380
just mud stomped everything in the handheld market, and the PSP is a competent little

828
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:10,340
nice device that displays well and is a great system.

829
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:16,820
I think the Vita, again, is going to be a nice piece of technology, but the 3DS hasn't

830
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:19,780
really started to wreck people yet.

831
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:22,660
Here's the thing about the 3DS, too.

832
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:28,140
We don't really know, aside from the ever-delayed Kid Icarus, what's really their plan beyond

833
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:29,380
2011.

834
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:34,300
It's just like, hey, we got Kid Icarus, because that's been delayed forever.

835
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:38,940
They've got the two Mario games that are going to be coming out this holiday, but they haven't

836
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:41,180
really said too much.

837
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:45,940
There was stuff at E3 and some other conference, but I don't remember any of that damn shit.

838
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:49,420
So since they're not keeping it fresh in my mind, that makes me think that they don't

839
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:56,060
really have a plan, and they're really going to need a plan when the Vita comes out, because

840
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:58,980
people may think otherwise by buying a system.

841
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:06,500
We do have expansion firmware-related news coming up later, and it's upgrades.

842
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:08,160
It's upgrades from what's there now.

843
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:12,860
One thing that I think might keep some people from buying a Vita is that, kind of like the

844
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:17,380
PSP, it's almost too nice.

845
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:19,180
Let's say you can afford the price point.

846
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:22,180
It's such a nice piece of hardware, but it's like, I don't want to put this in my pocket

847
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:23,900
or carry this around.

848
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:26,740
This is a nice thing.

849
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:31,300
If I take it out, it might get scratched or screwed up or something.

850
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:36,620
A portable device should, I don't want to say look like a toy, but the DS with the plastic

851
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:40,340
and it's got the clamshell and you close it, it looks like something that you can play

852
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:41,700
on the bus.

853
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:44,660
Whereas with the Vita, it's like, ooh, this is a very...

854
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:46,580
It's begging to get me mugged.

855
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:47,580
Yeah.

856
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:52,620
And it's weird that it almost looks too nice of a piece of thing that you want to take

857
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:53,620
outside the house.

858
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:54,620
I don't know.

859
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:59,040
Right now, the launch games, there's not really much been announced because they didn't really

860
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,500
know when the date of the Vita was.

861
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:04,260
And I know there's maybe four or five games that I actually know that are coming out launch

862
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:05,260
right now.

863
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:07,300
Some, I don't even know if they've been announced yet.

864
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:16,780
But Lego Harry Potter, that's not for me, Army Corps of Hell, that looks pretty cool,

865
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:24,320
Dragon's Crowned, and well, Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3.

866
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:28,220
But at least on a point you brought up with Nintendo, we don't really know what they're

867
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:32,420
doing beyond a year, but with the PlayStation Vita, we know Final Fantasy X is coming at

868
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:34,540
some point.

869
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:39,460
And with the Vita, I gotta say, the launch lineup is looking a hell lot better even with

870
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:44,180
not much announced already than the 3DS launch.

871
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:47,340
And also with the 3DS, they're still, and this is going to come up later in the show,

872
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:53,380
there's still that weirdness with that button, that right analog add-on, which is coming

873
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:56,660
to America, which we're going to bring up later, and does that mean that we're going

874
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:58,860
to get a new device altogether?

875
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:00,020
And they're just so awkward.

876
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:03,380
It's like that awkward friend you don't really want to invite over, but you kind of have

877
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:05,100
to.

878
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:09,700
Yeah, so there's a lot in the air right now for the 3DS.

879
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:13,740
Alright, well let's move on to another big thing that happened this week, of course,

880
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:14,740
BlizzCon!

881
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:18,500
And I know not all of you are into the Blizzard stuff, but they do make three pretty big PC

882
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:21,340
games, I mean, if not the biggest PC games.

883
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:25,780
Collectively they are Warcraft, Starcraft, and Diablo, and there was news about all those

884
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:27,700
games at BlizzCon this week.

885
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:32,820
But of course, the huge huge MMO, World of Warcraft, had a new expansion announced.

886
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:35,540
It's the Mists of Pandaria.

887
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:40,540
This was the name that had earlier been rumored thanks to a trademark filing earlier in the

888
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:44,980
year, but it was confirmed that the Pandarens, yes, that's panda people, will be the new

889
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:48,700
playable race in WoW for both the Alliance and the Horde.

890
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:51,700
You're going to be choosing at level 10 which side you're going to go on.

891
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:52,700
So that's the first race.

892
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:56,660
So they're going to finally add, like, you know, slash Panda Express now?

893
00:44:56,660 --> 00:45:01,280
No, but apparently there's some type of achievement that you get called Panda Express when you

894
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:05,300
do, like, 100 of those rolls, because the rolls make you run faster, and I'm just thinking

895
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:06,300
like...

896
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:07,300
They get a rolly polly tumble.

897
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:10,240
Well, it makes sense, because I know whenever I eat Panda Express I've got to run really

898
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,540
fast to the bathroom, so it makes sense.

899
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:14,260
Womp womp.

900
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:20,900
Also coming in the expansion, the Monk class, the level cap is raised to level 90, some

901
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:25,300
brand new end game things to participate in, a dungeon challenge mode where your item levels

902
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:29,500
will be capped, and you're going to go after gold, silver, and bronze medals in the various

903
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:30,500
dungeons in the game.

904
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:31,500
That actually sounds really cool.

905
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:33,580
I'm going to be very interested in that.

906
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:35,020
PvE scenarios.

907
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:39,980
For people that like the big PvP battlegrounds without their PvP, is basically what it sounds

908
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:44,940
like, and a new pet battle system that is basically Pokemon.

909
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:50,380
Blizzard has realized that a lot of people really like the pet collecting aspect of the

910
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:53,900
game, so they're expanding this whole new mini-game into it now where you're going to

911
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:56,340
have a Pokemon battle system.

912
00:45:56,340 --> 00:46:01,060
Basically you're going to have different talents on your pets, and your pets can use three

913
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:06,020
of them at a time, and they battle each other, and you can even go around the world and fight

914
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:09,100
master trainers to get new abilities.

915
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:12,820
They are not even being shy about what they're riving off here.

916
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:15,140
If Nintendo ain't going to do it, then...

917
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:16,140
Right.

918
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:20,780
And my main has, she's got like 110 little critters on her, so I'm ready to go.

919
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:21,780
I'm excited.

920
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:22,780
I want to check it out.

921
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:26,140
I'm excited to see how some of the critters are going to battle, because for the new

922
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:29,380
Halloween event this year, there's a pet that you can get very easy.

923
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:31,040
It's just a fucking box.

924
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:35,140
It's a cardboard box that follows you, but then once in a while, a little tongue will

925
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:36,620
jump out of the box.

926
00:46:36,620 --> 00:46:39,140
Supposedly it eats one of the other pets.

927
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:43,420
For Stephen King fans, if you've seen the movie Creepshow, and I know you don't like

928
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:45,520
horror, it's the monster in the crate.

929
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:49,100
It's the creepy crate from Creepshow, that 80s movie is what it is.

930
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:50,100
Oh, okay.

931
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:52,100
I got you.

932
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:57,820
Also, apparently there's going to be pets that you can only find out in the world, like

933
00:46:57,820 --> 00:47:01,200
at certain times of day, or during the spring.

934
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:05,020
I mean, wasn't that the kicker in the last Pokemon game on the DS?

935
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:07,420
Like there was Pokemon you can only catch at certain times of day and stuff?

936
00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:08,740
So, I mean...

937
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:11,820
If only there were a way to change the time on my DS.

938
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:13,700
Oh, oh wait.

939
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:18,180
Except, now you can't change the time on the Blizzard server, so it's going to be interesting

940
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:19,180
to see.

941
00:47:19,180 --> 00:47:23,220
I've already seen some people trolling that this is just going to be like the dance studio.

942
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:26,340
They're showing us screen caps now, but it's never going to happen.

943
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:31,500
I think it will, because what I'm liking about this expansion, I could care less about the

944
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:32,500
panda or the...

945
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:36,940
Well, the monk sounds interesting, I'll try a monk, but panda people, whatever, I'm over

946
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:37,940
it.

947
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:42,860
But as somebody who doesn't always get a chance to raid because I'm in more of a social guild

948
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:47,820
where I really just want to be with my friends, but I could see a group of about five people

949
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:51,180
in that guild getting really into this stupid pet battle thing.

950
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:56,700
So I like that it's giving people something else to do besides dungeons and raids.

951
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:58,740
And for that, I give them credit.

952
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:04,980
Yeah, they've really buffed up stuff for casual players and also PVP is getting entirely new

953
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:05,980
game concepts.

954
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:06,980
Murderball.

955
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:08,700
Murderball and a bunch of other stuff.

956
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:13,760
Maybe they should add it to Final Fantasy XIV since there's a lot of waiting for party.

957
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:14,760
You're funny.

958
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:15,760
All right.

959
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:21,060
So anyhow, that's pretty much all the big news with World of Warcraft, except one other

960
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:22,060
thing, right?

961
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:23,060
SalaciousPop?

962
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:25,260
Is that me or is it Loki?

963
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:26,260
No, that's you.

964
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:27,260
All right.

965
00:48:27,260 --> 00:48:28,260
All right.

966
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:29,260
Okay.

967
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:32,840
So World of Warcraft at one time had 12 million subscribers, right?

968
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:34,460
Top MMO in the world.

969
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:39,980
Well, Blizzard has another game coming out called Diablo III and they have this promotion

970
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:44,520
where it's like, all right, how can we do some damage control on the fact that we're

971
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:48,900
hemorrhaging subscriptions and also maybe cross pollinate our WoW audience with Diablo

972
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:49,900
III?

973
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:54,980
And what they've come up with is if you have a WoW license on your battle.net account as

974
00:48:54,980 --> 00:48:59,860
of October 18th, so it's already too late to buy a new WoW license for this.

975
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:02,020
So this is somewhat of a loyalty program.

976
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:05,380
Yeah, it's pretty much damage controlled.

977
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:12,060
You agree to a year of WoW billed at the regular $14.99 every 30 days.

978
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:14,920
You're just saying that you're going to do that for 12 months out.

979
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:19,140
You're going to get a free digital download license of Diablo III.

980
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:24,200
You're going to get access to the Mists of Pandaria beta, probably the very last stage

981
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:26,460
of it after the...

982
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:28,020
Everyone who signs up gets to play anyway.

983
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:32,860
Like after they do friends and family and after the NDA has been lifted.

984
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:37,540
And you get a Diablo themed, pretty badass looking mount for your WoW account in World

985
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:39,660
of Warcraft.

986
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:43,600
So yeah, there are some conditions obviously you need to have WoW on your battle.net account

987
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:45,820
as of last Wednesday.

988
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:48,180
If you...

989
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:53,900
In the terms and conditions of the agreement, if you, for whatever reason, your credit card

990
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:59,740
stops working and you don't make your payments, I believe they can pull the Diablo III license

991
00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:03,820
from your battle.net account simply because you have to log in to battle.net because of

992
00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:06,020
the real ID and stuff when you play Diablo III.

993
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:09,000
And Diablo III is very controversial because it's going to be online only.

994
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:13,940
And now we see another reason why.

995
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:18,080
Which to fuel all that anger that people had before about they can't play Diablo III offline,

996
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:19,700
now here's another reason why.

997
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:22,060
Because these people that are going to get the game for free, they're going to need to

998
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:24,620
connect every time to make sure their credit cards didn't bounce.

999
00:50:24,620 --> 00:50:28,020
And just to reiterate, if you sign up for this loyalty agreement, your cancel button

1000
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:29,060
is greyed out.

1001
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:31,460
You can't cancel.

1002
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:35,560
It's a cell phone contract in video games.

1003
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:40,220
And the timing can't be better because if you do this, because obviously hell yeah people

1004
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:44,900
want Diablo III, it's going to be one of the biggest games of either next year probably.

1005
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:51,300
You know, we've got Star Wars, MMO of the Old Republic coming out, Guild Wars 2, and

1006
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:54,500
whatever else, they're saying you can go play those games if you want but you're paying

1007
00:50:54,500 --> 00:51:00,380
for wow for a year regardless so you can have fun, we got your money.

1008
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:05,000
It's actually, when all is said and done, as kind of evil as it sounds, it's genius.

1009
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:09,060
It's absolute genius on Blizzard's part, is to lock people in.

1010
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:13,220
Lock in your loyal customers that are going to say, shit, I'm going to play wow for the

1011
00:51:13,220 --> 00:51:15,940
next year anyway and you're going to give me Diablo III free?

1012
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:17,220
Fuck yeah, I'm in.

1013
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:22,100
But now you can't make flirty eyes with Star Wars, MMO, and you can't go off and cheat

1014
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:23,100
with Guild Wars 2.

1015
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:24,980
You can, you're paying for both.

1016
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:27,020
But yeah, Blizzard will still have your money.

1017
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:30,240
You're not going to be tempted to cut wow for the other.

1018
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:33,580
And that's I think part of the reason why they're also saying well it's like a loyalty

1019
00:51:33,580 --> 00:51:34,580
thing.

1020
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:35,700
You can't already be a customer.

1021
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:39,100
This is to lock those 11 million people in, best they can.

1022
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:43,580
Yeah, so if you already have a relationship with wow and you're on the fence as to how

1023
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:47,820
long you're going to be with wow, this is to basically say, you know, pony up, we're

1024
00:51:47,820 --> 00:51:50,440
going to keep you and this is how we're going to do it.

1025
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:54,700
This isn't for people that have been thinking about trying out wow.

1026
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:58,140
Like this isn't a way to hop on both trains.

1027
00:51:58,140 --> 00:52:00,980
You know what's interesting about this too is that, and I don't even know if this got

1028
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:04,540
brought up on the other show when we were talking about it, but you know, um, yeah,

1029
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:08,020
you're going to get Diablo 3 free, but what else is going to come out while you're locked

1030
00:52:08,020 --> 00:52:14,140
into this 12 year or 12 month, not 12 year, 12 month, uh, plan Mr. Pandaria.

1031
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:18,180
So if you really want the full wow experience that you've now committed to, you're going

1032
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:20,780
to have to get Mr. Pandaria.

1033
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:23,900
So you may not have to buy Diablo 3, but you're going to have to buy the other game.

1034
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:29,420
I mean, I guess you don't have to, but you know that they're thinking everybody's going

1035
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:32,260
to that's locked in if they're locked into their wow account.

1036
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:36,900
For the previous wow expansion, Wrath of the Lich King, a lot of people killed the Lich

1037
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:40,740
King, which was the end boss supreme raid boss of that expansion.

1038
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:45,400
And then they canceled their wow all through the summer and they didn't sign up for until

1039
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:46,660
Cataclysm came out in December.

1040
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:48,860
So they got to save money by just saying, I'm going to be back.

1041
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:50,240
I'm just taking five months off.

1042
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:52,080
You can't really do that with this, right?

1043
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:55,060
You can't, you know, we killed Deathwing and Cataclysm.

1044
00:52:55,060 --> 00:52:59,500
You can't quit and come back from Mr. Pandaria if you're paying for this promotion.

1045
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:02,780
I want to clarify because some folks in chat are talking about how the payment works.

1046
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:03,880
Here's the deal.

1047
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:07,860
You're not agreeing to any type of payment plan with this.

1048
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:10,800
You're agreeing to keep your account current for 12 months.

1049
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:14,340
You can still pay with the cards, the prepaid cards.

1050
00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:16,940
So if you never want to give Blizzard your credit card, apparently you still don't have

1051
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:17,940
to.

1052
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:19,700
You can use the prepaid cards.

1053
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:23,140
But the other thing is, is that, well, I'm assuming though you have to still have a credit

1054
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:27,980
card on file, but so I don't know if you could really, but my understanding is that it can

1055
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:30,620
use the prepaid cards and when you sign up for it.

1056
00:53:30,620 --> 00:53:35,100
And I, I did it last night because let's do the lump sum.

1057
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:37,620
We can't, you can't do a 12 month lump sum.

1058
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:41,100
I know people are thinking that or that you have to pay that upfront, but you can't do

1059
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:42,100
12.

1060
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:44,660
It's the same payment methods that were always there.

1061
00:53:44,660 --> 00:53:47,520
You can do one month at 1499 a month.

1062
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:52,780
You can do three month lump sum at 1399 a month, or you can do what I did the six month

1063
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:55,300
lump sum at 1299 a month.

1064
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:59,900
And I know, so this month I'll have to pay $77, which is going to be six months a while,

1065
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:02,860
which I know I'm going to be playing anyway because I have the other show.

1066
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:08,200
And then in April, around the time I get my tax refund, I'll have to pay the other $77

1067
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:09,400
and then I'll be good for the year.

1068
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:11,140
So I kind of figure it'll work.

1069
00:54:11,140 --> 00:54:15,060
Yeah, that, that's good because I was on the three month plan cause 40 bucks, you know,

1070
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:19,180
once a quarter is reasonable and it's a dollar off what you'd be paying monthly.

1071
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:23,620
I thought that you had to roll over to 1499 every 30 days with this promotion, so it's

1072
00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:28,200
great to hear that you can, you do not, you can pick what you can still do the three months,

1073
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:32,800
but I think you have to have some type of recurring thing on file, but if you end up

1074
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:35,600
using the prepaid cards, then you're fine.

1075
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:38,700
It'll just keep, you know, you'll never get charged cause you keep stocking up with prepaid

1076
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:43,500
cards, but obviously they're going to, if they're going to give you a $50 game for free,

1077
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:46,400
they want to make sure that you're going to make good on your promise.

1078
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:49,980
You know, because I don't see blizzard sending bill collectors after people if they don't

1079
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:50,980
make good on their payments.

1080
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:54,720
Well, what if you get Diablo three through this promotion and then you make IRL money

1081
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:56,520
with the new Diablo three auction house thing?

1082
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:59,880
We'll shut that shit down if you don't, if you don't make good on your payments and something

1083
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:00,880
you think about.

1084
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:04,040
And what I really want to come to this, like I know some of you could give a shit about

1085
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:09,680
wow and Diablo and all that stuff like, like Loki probably doesn't really, but here's what

1086
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:13,700
I do want to say with this and Loki where I can get your opinion is that now that blizzard

1087
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:19,320
has thrown that idea out there precedent has been set precedent has been set.

1088
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:20,320
Imagine it.

1089
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:31,700
Loki next year, sign up for a year of Xbox live and get free halo maps, woo PlayStation

1090
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:34,160
plus to an extent is somewhat like this.

1091
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:37,920
I give you free games, but the minute you stopped paying for PlayStation plus they're

1092
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:38,920
gone.

1093
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:41,200
Yeah, I could see that.

1094
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:45,620
I mean I already paid for live so I don't really care.

1095
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:49,560
I mean that's just my thing cause I do play online every day.

1096
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:51,520
Well almost every day.

1097
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:55,880
So it's not like you can go without it.

1098
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:59,580
And they already and it's already, I already renew a year or year prepaid every time.

1099
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:04,840
So yeah, that's cool if you want to give me some more free shit on top of that, cool.

1100
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:09,640
I probably don't give a crap about it, especially if it's halo maps or even halo a game.

1101
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:13,080
You know, I don't care.

1102
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:16,460
I got to say though, I mean I know there's a lot of chatter on the internet and a lot

1103
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:21,200
of people and of course a lot of cynical ness about this and I understand it is, you know,

1104
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:26,460
I have to admit I did have a big hesitation about doing this because it's signing a contract

1105
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:27,540
with a video game company.

1106
00:56:27,540 --> 00:56:28,800
That's a little weird to me.

1107
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:29,960
It's really weird.

1108
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:34,500
But at the end of the day I realized, look, I'm going to pay for this game for a year.

1109
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:35,500
I know I'm going to be doing this.

1110
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:38,580
I have the other show and it's not going anywhere anytime soon.

1111
00:56:38,580 --> 00:56:40,320
And I know I'm buying Diablo three.

1112
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:42,060
Like I know I'm buying, I'm in the beta right now.

1113
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:43,060
I love it.

1114
00:56:43,060 --> 00:56:44,280
I, it's, I need more of it.

1115
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:45,720
I'm going to buy Diablo three.

1116
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:47,280
So for me, this is great.

1117
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:48,480
It's not for everybody.

1118
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:50,320
This deal is not for everybody.

1119
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:55,060
In fact, if most people that are probably making fun of this probably aren't even eligible

1120
00:56:55,060 --> 00:56:58,500
for it anyway because you have to be a current wow subscriber.

1121
00:56:58,500 --> 00:56:59,720
So this isn't for everybody.

1122
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:02,640
This is just Blizzard's way of making sure you're going to stay loyal.

1123
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:05,400
And if you dealt, they'll give you a little something extra.

1124
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:08,760
I mean, at the end of the day, I said, you know what, I'm going to end up paying for

1125
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:09,760
a while anyway.

1126
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:12,840
And I know it, I might as well get Diablo three free.

1127
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:15,840
By the way, and there's another, isn't there, isn't there something a little less on this

1128
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:16,840
too?

1129
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:17,840
Yeah.

1130
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:21,520
I was going to mention, um, Blizzard always puts out very sexy collector's editions, whether

1131
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:24,240
it be for a wow expansion or for Starcraft or whatever.

1132
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:28,640
Um, so of course Diablo three collector's edition is going to have some nice swag in

1133
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:29,640
it.

1134
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:34,840
Some bonus stuff, namely a, um, the big one is going to be a USB drive with a little Diablo

1135
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:37,280
skull caddy that you can put the drive in.

1136
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:42,120
And on that drive is Diablo two, and I believe it's expansion, at least I would hope so that

1137
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:45,160
you can then install off the USB drive or play off the USB drive.

1138
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:50,700
Um, you're going to get the wow mount that you would also get for doing this, um, annual

1139
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:53,840
subscription with the free copy if you're an existing well, so you get the mount.

1140
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:58,400
Um, but also if you're thinking, well, I want to do this 12 month promotion and get the

1141
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:00,720
game for free, but that's the standard edition.

1142
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:05,440
If I go to fries or Best Buy and I'm going to drop 80 bucks for this hella Diablo three

1143
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:09,160
box edition, cause it's bad-ass, that's going to screw me over for the promotion.

1144
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:14,280
Um, what's going to happen is, is if you apply that collector's edition code to your battle.net

1145
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:18,920
account with the 12 month promotion thing on it, you're, they're going to add four months

1146
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:20,960
free to your wow subscription.

1147
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:25,840
So you are going to make up that money somehow and in lieu of more wow, more wow, pay 12

1148
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:27,320
months a while, get more wow.

1149
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:28,800
So there you go.

1150
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:29,800
All right.

1151
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:32,520
So anyhow, I don't want to dwell too much on this, but you know, again, I think the

1152
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:40,600
precedent here, don't be surprised if Activision, the parent company, isn't looking at this

1153
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:45,920
going, Hmm, how could we sell more Skylanders dolls by getting people to commit?

1154
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:49,080
How much do you love your Skylanders?

1155
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:50,080
We'll see.

1156
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:54,440
I just, I don't know if it would really work with anything other than a, you know, subscription

1157
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:59,640
service like, you know, cause they kind of already do that with Call of Duty elite.

1158
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:02,460
You would, so either it's a one year fee.

1159
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:07,040
It's not like, Hey, at the sign of contract, it's, yeah, we just have one fee.

1160
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:11,760
So I don't know, it would just, it would have to put out more MMOs over to imagine.

1161
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:12,760
All right.

1162
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:14,840
Well, let's move on with some more gaming news.

1163
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:15,840
Loki.

1164
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:24,920
So, uh, so some non wow related stuff, um, we can talk a little bit about a game.

1165
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:28,720
I used to play a lot in the arcade since we were talking about arcades a little bit ago,

1166
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:29,960
NFL blitz.

1167
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:30,960
It's coming back.

1168
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:31,960
Yeah.

1169
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:36,160
Hey, remember Midway used to put it out and then Midway went under and then, you know,

1170
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:44,600
they tried re, you know, booting it or whatever and then quite work out too well.

1171
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:47,440
So now of course it's called NFL blitz.

1172
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:48,440
So who has it?

1173
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:56,380
Of course, EA, because they have the NFL license and a EA, we'll be putting that out in 2012.

1174
00:59:56,380 --> 01:00:02,240
It's going to be, uh, put out by EA Tiberian and uh, it's kind of neat.

1175
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:07,360
They've got a pretty much the same gameplay style as before, plus a little bit of like

1176
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:10,440
a Madden flare thrown in there.

1177
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:16,720
And um, I guess they also say that you have a currency system called blitz bucks where

1178
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:24,280
you can boost, uh, your teams and modify them in a bunch of different ways as well as, um,

1179
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:28,840
custom modes and loading screens, stat boosting type stuff.

1180
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:32,480
And um, also custom rosters.

1181
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:37,560
You can set up a survival mode, uh, called a blitz gauntlet.

1182
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:42,440
And I guess that's where you take on several teams, um, back to back.

1183
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:45,920
And then also they have a online gameplay as well.

1184
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:47,160
So that should be pretty big.

1185
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:48,160
Yeah.

1186
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:53,760
I have to admit, you know, again, I'm not super into sports games, but if I was into

1187
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:57,600
a game that was like football, it would be NFL blitz.

1188
01:00:57,600 --> 01:01:00,120
And I like the arcade sports games.

1189
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:01,120
It's not too big of a surprise.

1190
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:02,120
I mean, come on.

1191
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:03,120
They have NBA jams.

1192
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:11,460
So yeah, and apparently from another article that I read, um, it actually got leaked out

1193
01:01:11,460 --> 01:01:16,080
by somebody a while back, but it was just kind of one of those, an industry insider

1194
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:21,440
says this and you know, they didn't really have much, you know, to back it up, but it

1195
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:23,920
did leak out a while back.

1196
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:24,920
Yeah.

1197
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:27,840
I was going to say they did a really good job keeping it a secret.

1198
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:34,360
I mean, there was one story I think somewhere, but you know, with a series like NFL blitz,

1199
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:37,940
there's always going to be a rumor, especially, you know, we all know midway shut down.

1200
01:01:37,940 --> 01:01:40,760
We all know their assets were sold off, including the IPs.

1201
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:43,520
It was just a matter of time before it showed up.

1202
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:44,520
Right.

1203
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:45,520
Yeah.

1204
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:50,040
So, so hit stun in chat asks, so the Madden developers are making NFL blitz now.

1205
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:55,480
Kinda, I mean, it's not the same team, but it's same building pretty much.

1206
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:56,480
Right.

1207
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:57,480
Yeah.

1208
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:58,480
Just down the hall from each other.

1209
01:01:58,480 --> 01:01:59,480
Right.

1210
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:00,480
Yeah.

1211
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:03,160
Well, it's not a big surprise cause they've, they've done like some different things before.

1212
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:11,200
Like they've tried that, uh, like there was a, uh, NFL game that they put out a while

1213
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:12,200
back.

1214
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:16,200
Well, they had NFL street and that's kind of been in sore hit and miss.

1215
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:22,320
And then they had, uh, some NFL game, I think it was like, uh, all pro or something like

1216
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:23,320
that.

1217
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:27,880
You know, that was the, uh, uh, two K one, but they had another NFL game that was more

1218
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:31,440
arcadey, a little bit like arena football almost.

1219
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:34,200
And well, they had an arena football game at one time even.

1220
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:40,800
Um, but yeah, they, they, they like to experiment with that type of stuff.

1221
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:44,200
And really, you know, what they should get on the bandwagon for is rugby games because

1222
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:49,680
this year is the year of rugby games and they did have a rugby game back in 06, but it's

1223
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:50,680
been a while.

1224
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:51,680
All right.

1225
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:55,000
Let's move on with some more information about final fantasy 14.

1226
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,440
You know, we've been talking about it a little bit on the show.

1227
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:00,640
There's going to be a lot of change coming to that game next year and it's almost, it's,

1228
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:01,880
it's a little bit unprecedented.

1229
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:06,160
You know, we've never really had a MMO where at least that I can think of, maybe there's

1230
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:10,160
no one, but we never really had one where it landed with such a thud that the developers

1231
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:14,520
are like, we're going to reboot the whole damn game and make it a success.

1232
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:19,840
Well, uh, now Kiyoshita, who is the producer and director of Final Fantasy 14 has come

1233
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:25,400
out and said they are considering Vita and smartphone support for Final Fantasy 14.

1234
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:33,320
Uh, the quote from the, uh, interview, I believe, which was with VG 24 seven, uh, said, quote,

1235
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:35,440
not just the Vita, but also smartphones.

1236
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:37,420
So that kind of access will be allowed.

1237
01:03:37,420 --> 01:03:41,640
That will open the door to things like applications that people can use to check their inventory

1238
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:44,840
or check the market and purchase things from the auctions.

1239
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:48,520
So it kind of sounds like what wow kind of already does, but maybe a little something

1240
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:49,520
extra.

1241
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:53,200
I mean, who knows what could come with this, by the way, they are also still speaking with

1242
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:58,120
Microsoft about an Xbox 360 version, but they are focusing on a PlayStation three version

1243
01:03:58,120 --> 01:04:01,840
right now saying that basically they promised they were going to make a PlayStation three

1244
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:02,980
version version.

1245
01:04:02,980 --> 01:04:05,420
They haven't kept it and they need to fulfill it.

1246
01:04:05,420 --> 01:04:09,240
But I think at this point it's probably a good thing that they wait until 2.0 is done

1247
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:11,220
until they launch it on the PlayStation three.

1248
01:04:11,220 --> 01:04:16,240
And seriously, my God, Microsoft needs to get on the ball with, you know, allowing MMOs

1249
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:19,660
onto their, uh, their service.

1250
01:04:19,660 --> 01:04:25,040
So, um, it'll be interesting to see if that ends up actually happening or maybe who knows

1251
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:29,400
for the next Xbox system, you know, Final Fantasy 11 was one of the early, early titles for

1252
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:30,400
the Xbox 360.

1253
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:31,400
So you never know.

1254
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:33,080
It might end up going onto the next.

1255
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:35,760
And that didn't need, uh, XP gold.

1256
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:36,760
Did it?

1257
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:37,760
No.

1258
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:42,040
11 is really unlike any other 360 game because if you think about it, play online as a joint

1259
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:46,000
venture with Sony, you've got a Sony game on a, and that was their biller rider, their

1260
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,000
membership thing.

1261
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:48,000
Yeah.

1262
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,000
Now 14 doesn't use that.

1263
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:54,360
It's a, it's all kind of separate, but Final Fantasy 11 is really unlike anything else

1264
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:55,400
on the 360.

1265
01:04:55,400 --> 01:05:00,120
And I think Microsoft really bent all the rules to get that game on their console because

1266
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:02,720
you know, it was, it was early on, it was a launch.

1267
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:04,760
And I got to say, cause I did play 11 back in the day.

1268
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:05,760
It was pretty awesome on the 360.

1269
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:09,840
Like if you had the keyboard and everything for it, it was a great way to play the game.

1270
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:14,600
So, and I was talking to you about this last night, but, uh, luckily for Final Fantasy

1271
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:20,580
14, it's a gorgeous enough game that if it takes them another year or two to get their

1272
01:05:20,580 --> 01:05:25,240
shit together, considering how wow is seven years old and is finally starting to show

1273
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:32,240
its age visually, it's a pretty enough a game that it will still be relevant by the time

1274
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:33,600
they fix it.

1275
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:34,600
Yeah.

1276
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:39,000
So, I mean, the other thing I, with the whole PlayStation three launch of 2.0, I wanted

1277
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:43,120
to kind of reiterate is that remember when Final Fantasy 11 came out in America, we got

1278
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:47,160
version 2.0 of the game was the launch of the game to us because the rise of the Zillart

1279
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:49,960
expansion was included when that game launched here.

1280
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:53,720
So we never saw the earliest version of that game, which also I guess was kind of buggy.

1281
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:57,880
So I don't know, it's going to be interesting to see what happens, but don't expect me to

1282
01:05:57,880 --> 01:06:00,080
pay for the game for a year to find out.

1283
01:06:00,080 --> 01:06:02,600
That's, that's my big thing.

1284
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:03,600
So we'll see.

1285
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:10,560
Um, speaking of MMOs, uh, we get another question in our chat room from, uh, did I get away

1286
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:11,560
ZHEB?

1287
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:12,560
Z-H-E?

1288
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:13,560
Z-H-E?

1289
01:06:13,560 --> 01:06:14,560
I can't pronounce this.

1290
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:15,560
ZHSB, I think it is.

1291
01:06:15,560 --> 01:06:19,560
You're going to make them spell it out again.

1292
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:24,960
Yeah, ZHSB in chat says, do you think Guild Wars two will end up being higher quality

1293
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:25,960
than wow?

1294
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:29,720
I know it won't be a wow killer, but I'm still curious to see what you think.

1295
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:35,720
Guild Wars strength will always be its model and the fact that once you buy the game, there

1296
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:37,040
is no monthly fee.

1297
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:41,220
And that is so alluring to a lot of people that don't want to play wow, you know, because

1298
01:06:41,220 --> 01:06:42,220
of that whole thing.

1299
01:06:42,220 --> 01:06:46,120
And that's what makes Final Fantasy 14 good right now is that it's the same model essentially

1300
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:47,720
because they're not charging for monthly fee.

1301
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:51,920
Uh, Guild Wars two looks great, but I can't tell you anything else until I can really

1302
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:53,040
get my hands on it.

1303
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:56,840
It's one thing to see the demos on YouTube and I gotta say it looks sexy as hell.

1304
01:06:56,840 --> 01:06:57,840
The graphics look great.

1305
01:06:57,840 --> 01:07:03,440
I'm really excited, but again, I got to get my hands on it until I can really tell you

1306
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:04,840
if it's going to be worth it or not.

1307
01:07:04,840 --> 01:07:06,240
So next year we'll see.

1308
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:09,880
So, all right, let's move on.

1309
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:13,920
More stories, Slicey Pop.

1310
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:19,080
So of course we all remember back in April when it was the week that Portal two and Mortal

1311
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:23,280
Kombat came out that PlayStation network was hacked and everyone was very sad and it was

1312
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:26,740
very end of the world.

1313
01:07:26,740 --> 01:07:34,960
And as a result, when all these gaming journalism sites were like, well, how can you avoid having

1314
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:39,260
your credit cards saved to these servers if they're going to get compromised so often?

1315
01:07:39,260 --> 01:07:43,560
And one of the solutions was to buy game codes.

1316
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:48,640
I know if you go into GameStop, you'll see a whole wall of basically these kind of look

1317
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:54,080
like gift cards at the supermarket where you're just buying the code.

1318
01:07:54,080 --> 01:07:56,120
You're paying obviously the retailer for that.

1319
01:07:56,120 --> 01:08:00,600
You take the code, you load it into your PS3 and you're downloading the game directly without

1320
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:05,360
having to put a credit card, put points into your PSN bucket and all that stuff.

1321
01:08:05,360 --> 01:08:09,640
One of the ways to get these codes was through Amazon.

1322
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:12,600
You could buy these cards through Amazon directly.

1323
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:17,040
Or I think maybe they just emailed a code to you and it was a way to get around Sony's

1324
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:22,120
shopping cart and if you're worried about having your credit card information stolen

1325
01:08:22,120 --> 01:08:29,400
because Amazon I think is a more reputable retailer, well, those PSN stores, primarily

1326
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:32,600
the ones on Amazon, all that content has been removed.

1327
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:34,400
You cannot do that anymore.

1328
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:38,440
So for all the people that were using Amazon to get around PSN.

1329
01:08:38,440 --> 01:08:41,160
Which was a lot more people after the hacks, I'm sure.

1330
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:42,160
Yeah.

1331
01:08:42,160 --> 01:08:43,160
After that whole end of the world thing.

1332
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:47,520
And we still haven't heard, I don't think, about anybody really getting screwed over.

1333
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:48,520
Meanwhile on Xbox.

1334
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:49,520
Yeah.

1335
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:50,520
Meanwhile on Xbox Live.

1336
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:55,520
Who by the way got hacked this week, another friend of mine, just saying.

1337
01:08:55,520 --> 01:09:00,760
So Amazon has confirmed the removal of the content and they have no announcements regarding

1338
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:04,680
this change in selection so they're being kind of hush-hush about it.

1339
01:09:04,680 --> 01:09:09,080
I believe Sony has been nudged to their PR saying, what's up with Amazon?

1340
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:12,160
Why'd they drop your stuff?

1341
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:13,880
Sony hasn't responded yet.

1342
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:14,880
Interesting.

1343
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:15,880
So.

1344
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:20,040
They could be, they might be just not happy with the fact that, what was it, they found

1345
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:25,600
out that it was like some Amazon servers that were used to hack the Playstation network or

1346
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:26,600
whatever like that.

1347
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:32,160
Oh yeah, it was through like one of their S3 data, like web hosting accounts or something.

1348
01:09:32,160 --> 01:09:33,160
Yeah.

1349
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:37,600
I doubt that has anything to do with it but more of that they want more control over that

1350
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:38,600
stuff.

1351
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:44,280
Yeah, I'm kind of curious as to what's going on there but maybe it's just they just for

1352
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:45,960
whatever reason don't want to do it.

1353
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:49,080
Maybe they just want to try to get more people to tie their credit cards on PSN.

1354
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:50,080
Yeah.

1355
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:51,080
Or maybe.

1356
01:09:51,080 --> 01:09:52,080
Yeah.

1357
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:54,400
It could have, we don't really know if it was Amazon's decision.

1358
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:56,280
Maybe because they just, maybe they just didn't sell well.

1359
01:09:56,280 --> 01:10:01,020
Maybe people just buy those game codes at a retailer like a brick and mortar one.

1360
01:10:01,020 --> 01:10:03,440
Or maybe Sony's got something competing coming up.

1361
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:04,440
Who knows?

1362
01:10:04,440 --> 01:10:05,440
So.

1363
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:08,320
Alright, anyhow, let's travel the world and check out release dates.

1364
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:11,060
What is coming out to a gaming store near you this week?

1365
01:10:11,060 --> 01:10:13,320
And it's starting to ramp up towards the holidays, right Loki?

1366
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:14,680
Ah yeah, it's already ramped up.

1367
01:10:14,680 --> 01:10:15,680
We've got tons of stuff.

1368
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:23,240

1374
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,200
Ew, is that like Kidz Bop?

1375
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:55,160
You know, it used to be kind of like the wheels on the bus go round and round and that kind

1376
01:10:55,160 --> 01:11:00,040
of bullshit, but actually it's not so much that now.

1377
01:11:00,040 --> 01:11:06,280
They do have some songs on there, I'm not really sure if I recognize them.

1378
01:11:06,280 --> 01:11:07,920
Is it just family safe stuff?

1379
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:14,380
Like old disco songs and not like, you know, ooh, pop your pussy girl, ooh, like that kind

1380
01:11:14,380 --> 01:11:15,380
of music.

1381
01:11:15,380 --> 01:11:16,380
Yeah, nothing like that.

1382
01:11:16,380 --> 01:11:20,600
No, like they had some songs listed on here, like I don't even know what, yeah, shake your

1383
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:26,120
groove thing, obviously, uh, Whip My Hair, no idea what that is, Despicable Me.

1384
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:27,720
Wait, wait, you don't know Whip My Hair?

1385
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:29,760
No, what's Whip My Hair?

1386
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:31,400
Willow Smith?

1387
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:32,400
Will Smith's kid?

1388
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:35,280
Oh, no, I don't know his song, sorry, okay.

1389
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:37,800
No, no, it's not his song, it's his kid song.

1390
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:40,200
I whip my hair back and forth, you've never heard that song.

1391
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:42,920
No, I have not heard that song, and I don't wish to hear that song.

1392
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:44,640
Do you live in a cave or something?

1393
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:49,280
I don't listen to fucking radio, okay, oh, I'm sorry, it's not one of the ten songs that

1394
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:53,480
they play on top 40 stations, yes, I know, top 40, that means they play the same ten

1395
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:57,560
songs four times every hour.

1396
01:11:57,560 --> 01:12:02,280
You have to hear how amazing this song is, and by amazing, I mean amazingly terrible,

1397
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:05,920
hold on, I'm trying to bring it up in studio right now, hold on, let's see here if I can

1398
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:06,920
get it going.

1399
01:12:06,920 --> 01:12:21,000
Yeah, props to him, I mean, I hope that he does end up-

1400
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:24,000
Just remember, she's nine.

1401
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:27,640
Come on, Loki, dance.

1402
01:12:27,640 --> 01:12:32,040
Okay, I'll stop torturing the listeners.

1403
01:12:32,040 --> 01:12:34,880
What the hell?

1404
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:39,720
She obviously did not inherit her dad's musical talent, but hey-

1405
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:41,920
She's nine, Loki, give her a break.

1406
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:44,840
Yeah, she's nine, I've seen better, okay, I mean-

1407
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:48,760
You've seen better nine year olds, really, where on Toddlers and Tiaras?

1408
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:53,320
Because I can't think of where else to see nine year olds performing.

1409
01:12:53,320 --> 01:12:58,400
Well on America's Got Talent, on The X Factor, on, you know-

1410
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:00,440
Are you rooting for What's Her Name, that little girl?

1411
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:04,720
No, you see, here's the thing, I watched The X Factor one time.

1412
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:09,880
The first night it was on, and I haven't looked back.

1413
01:13:09,880 --> 01:13:15,920
I think it's catchy, she has great producers, but whatever.

1414
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:20,040
Something That I Want and Love Me, I don't know any of those songs, anyways, so yeah,

1415
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:25,360
they have 40 plus fun songs in there, that's all you need, that's kids stuff.

1416
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:30,880
Centipede Infestation on the Wii and 3DS, this is Atari trying to reboot the Centipede

franchise, good luck with that.

1418
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:40,440
Photo World on the Nintendo DS, this is a game that is going to be, I guess, using the

1419
01:13:40,440 --> 01:13:42,920
DSi.

1420
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:47,680
It's basically a game for taking photos and editing photos or something like that.

1421
01:13:47,680 --> 01:13:49,160
That sounds terrible.

1422
01:13:49,160 --> 01:13:54,280
Nikolai's Pencil Puzzle 3D for the 3DS, the first puzzle game, I think, for the 3DS.

01:14:57,880 --> 01:14:58,880
a surprise.

1443
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:26,440
Yes they did.

1444
01:15:26,440 --> 01:15:27,440
Okay.

1445
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:34,560
Cause they're done with Shrek and they need to, you know, Antonio Banderas needs to eat.

1446
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:39,720
That's on Xbox 360, Playstation 3, DS, Wii, and I think 3DS.

1447
01:15:39,720 --> 01:15:46,040
Disney Universe, this is supposed to be like Kingdom Hearts, sort of, kinda, not really.

1448
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:50,040
I'm curious about Disney Universe, I gotta admit, cause like everybody was like, Rob

1449
01:15:50,040 --> 01:15:54,240
you'd be so into this game, and I haven't heard a lot about it, which is usually a bad

1450
01:15:54,240 --> 01:15:55,240
sign.

1451
01:15:55,240 --> 01:15:59,320
It reminds me of a Ratchet and Clank type game, it's uh, you know, of course you get

1452
01:15:59,320 --> 01:16:02,880
to wear different costumes, you can get abilities from those costumes.

1453
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:05,160
It's on 360, Wii, and PS3.

1454
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:09,480
House of the Dead Overkill, I'm looking, if you hear things in the background, I'm looking

1455
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:11,800
at like a little walkthrough, I guess, of the game.

1456
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:16,680
House of the Dead Overkill extended cut on Playstation 3 with even more swearing.

1457
01:16:16,680 --> 01:16:20,680
Sorry, I don't wanna hear the, I was gonna play the audio, but it's just some douchebag

1458
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:22,260
talking over the gameplay.

1459
01:16:22,260 --> 01:16:23,260
It looks neat.

1460
01:16:23,260 --> 01:16:24,260
Yeah, it looks alright.

1461
01:16:24,260 --> 01:16:26,080
It looks like a little big planet.

1462
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:30,760
I think I remember somebody saying something about like a little big planet-ish Disney

1463
01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:31,760
game.

1464
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:36,080
Yeah, I mean, they look like the little big planet sack boys, but it's obviously not that,

1465
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:37,560
but I mean, it looks alright.

1466
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:39,120
That might be kinda fun, I might check that out.

1467
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:40,120
Definitely a good kid's game.

1468
01:16:40,120 --> 01:16:41,120
Um.

1469
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:42,120
What do you mean kid's game?

1470
01:16:42,120 --> 01:16:43,120
I love Disney.

1471
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:44,120
Alright.

1472
01:16:44,120 --> 01:16:45,120
You hush.

1473
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:52,240
Uh, Dance Central 2 coming out this week on 360, also Kinect Sports Season 2 on 360, uh,

1474
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:59,120
The Invisibles Shadow Zone for PSP, including the camera, uh, Battlefield 3, the big game

1475
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:08,360

Country Dance 2 on the Wii, and Jane's Advanced Strike Fighter for PC.

1477
01:17:15,160 --> 01:17:16,160
That is it.

1478
01:17:16,160 --> 01:17:17,160
That was a lot of games.

1479
01:17:17,160 --> 01:17:20,200
It is a lot of games, and it's only gonna get bigger until it gets to December.

1480
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:24,520
Alright, Japan this week, going to Japan on the 27th of October, Dance Central 2 on the

1481
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:32,200
Xbox 360, Kinect Sports Season 2, Moovloov, Muv Luv, I don't know what this is, Muv Luv,

1482
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:35,760
and a Warhammer 40,000 space ring, I've gotta see what Muv Luv is.

1483
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:36,760
Muv Luv?

1484
01:17:36,760 --> 01:17:37,760
I don't wanna see the peripheral for that.

1485
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:43,600
No, it's, it's not Muv Luv, I think it's an anime, I think it's based off an anime, cause

1486
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:46,680
clearly it's a bunch of anime chicks, I'm looking for, like, gameplay, and I don't see

1487
01:17:46,680 --> 01:17:52,320
any, so, oh, there's one, that's, Muv Luv, looks like Sakura Wars, strategy, maybe?

1488
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:53,520
I don't know.

1489
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:58,620
Big Tittied Cyberbots, uh, let's see, moving on, the best kind, that is an awesome name

1490
01:17:58,620 --> 01:18:01,360
for a game.

1491
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:05,480
Don't push your luck, just because we're getting, uh, bungee ferret tossing, don't push your

1492
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:12,240
luck on Big Tittied Cyberbots, although, if anything was gonna get added to the list,

1493
01:18:12,240 --> 01:18:20,640
the week Jamie's not here, uh, on the Playstation 3 this week, Makai Senki Disgaea 4, that's

1494
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:25,420
right, Disgaea 4 out in Japan this week, as well as Midnight Club Los Angeles, uh, going

1495
01:18:25,420 --> 01:18:31,040
into the Classics Collection, Tears to Tiara Gaiden, Avalon no Nazo, and, a lot of people

1496
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:37,640
very excited about this one, you ready, the Idolmaster 2 on the Playstation 3 this week.

1497
01:18:37,640 --> 01:18:41,840
All I have to say about the Idolmaster is just, just, go look at some gameplay video

1498
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:45,880
on YouTube, that's really all I have to say, um, looking at some of the handhelds this

1499
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:52,480
week, the Sony PSP Arcana Familia, La Storia della Arcana Familia, I don't know what the

1500
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:58,000
heck this game is, uh, I don't know if that's, I'm trying to look again at gameplay, but

1501
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:03,920
it just, again, looks like another anime slash comic manga type of integrated thing there,

1502
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:07,960
uh, Final Fantasy Type Zero, I think there'll be a few people excited about that, that is

1503
01:19:07,960 --> 01:19:14,360
finally out on the PSP this week, Ragnarok Hikari Toyami no Kujo, yes, I believe this

1504
01:19:14,360 --> 01:19:19,200
is another Ragnarok Online, yep, based game, that's what it looks like to me, so, Dark

1505
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:24,200
Sakura, sadly not here to squeak, Soshipop, are you gonna squeak on behalf of Dark Sakura?

01:21:07,320 --> 01:21:08,320
Alright.

1523
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:14,440
And there's a whole bunch of other stuff listed under generically October 2011 and I'm not

1524
01:21:14,440 --> 01:21:15,880
gonna read off all that stuff.

1525
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:16,880
Yeah.

1526
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:17,880
There's a lot.

1527
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:18,880
That's fine.

1528
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:19,880
Alright, let's move on.

1529
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:23,320
Just a couple more stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week, yes, Dark

1530
01:21:23,320 --> 01:21:27,320
Sakura has given her blessing that we could do a game this week without her, and we've

1531
01:21:27,320 --> 01:21:28,480
got a good one tonight.

1532
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:30,560
Uh, meanwhile, couple quick news stories.

1533
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:31,560
Loki.

1534
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:36,680
Hey, I remember a few months back, several months back, there was a guy named Jigohot

1535
01:21:36,680 --> 01:21:43,520
and there was a whole bunch of hub-a-bub about, uh, hub-a-lub, hub-a-loo, about, uh, you know,

1536
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:47,880
PlayStation 3 and jailbreaks and stuff like that and the keys being leaked out and all

1537
01:21:47,880 --> 01:21:48,880
that fun stuff.

1538
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:50,680
Well, we're back to that again.

1539
01:21:50,680 --> 01:21:53,640
Um, there is a new jailbreak that's out now.

1540
01:21:53,640 --> 01:22:01,080
It apparently is for, uh, the firmware version 355 consoles and supports games up to current,

1541
01:22:01,080 --> 01:22:06,080
up to the current firmware, uh, 3.73, so you're able to patch the games and play them on those

1542
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:07,080
consoles.

1543
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:13,760
Finally, the dongle will allow you to play titles burned to Blu-ray discs, uh, via, um,

1544
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:18,960
a hard drive, including FIFA 12, Driver San Francisco, God of War Origins Collection,

1545
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:25,320
Pro Evo 2012, X-Men Destiny, and Sniper Ghost Warrior, and, uh, it's circulating in Indonesia

1546
01:22:25,320 --> 01:22:31,040
right now and will be sold for roughly 45 bucks, and, uh, they have, like, a little

1547
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:35,760
video showing it and it kinda boots up to, like, a developer screen and stuff like that.

1548
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:38,440
So obviously, what's that mean for everybody else?

1549
01:22:38,440 --> 01:22:42,760
Well, it means a lot more patches and a lot more firmware updates, of course, as they

1550
01:22:42,760 --> 01:22:48,240
try to block this thing, so look forward to that, and hopefully the network doesn't go

1551
01:22:48,240 --> 01:22:52,280
down again.

1552
01:22:52,280 --> 01:22:58,660
Like I've said before, I think, uh, crypto hackers that are really into DRM and stuff,

1553
01:22:58,660 --> 01:23:00,480
they may not even care about games that much.

1554
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:04,600
They just love the challenge of breaking really good crypto, and then they put it out and

1555
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:08,680
they make money off of it, so, you know, who knows?

1556
01:23:08,680 --> 01:23:12,520
But it's just gonna, you know, it's just like plugging your thumb into a dam with all these

1557
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:17,280
holes in it, trying to keep the water out, and only do it for so long.

1558
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:23,240
Alright, well, moving on to another story for you guys, this is actually a pretty big

1559
01:23:23,240 --> 01:23:24,240
one.

1560
01:23:24,240 --> 01:23:27,400
Nintendo had a press conference in the middle of the night, well, okay, it was day during

1561
01:23:27,400 --> 01:23:30,760
Japan, but it was the middle of the night for us, about the 3DS, and just detailing

1562
01:23:30,760 --> 01:23:34,280
a ton and ton of new updates coming for the 3DS.

1563
01:23:34,280 --> 01:23:39,180
It's all around one big firmware update coming this November, I don't think we had a specific

1564
01:23:39,180 --> 01:23:40,180
date on this, right?

1565
01:23:40,180 --> 01:23:41,880
Of course not, so they can delay it.

1566
01:23:41,880 --> 01:23:45,040
Right, so it can be the very last day of November and still be on time.

1567
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:48,700
Uh, some of the features that are gonna be in this, 3D video recording, which they've

1568
01:23:48,700 --> 01:23:54,320
said before, um, you're gonna be able to make clips up to 10 minutes long, what also is

1569
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:59,320
part of this, which I admit is kinda cool, stop motion animation, part of the 3D videos.

1570
01:23:59,320 --> 01:24:00,320
That's neat.

1571
01:24:00,320 --> 01:24:04,720
I mean, it's easy, but it's, it's gonna, you know people are gonna get creative with this,

1572
01:24:04,720 --> 01:24:05,720
it'll be fun.

1573
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:11,440
I, it's, it's a neat idea, but, ugh, cameras are just really terrible.

1574
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:14,320
But that's alright, they'll fix that in the next version of the 3DS, so.

1575
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:19,960
Uh, there will be a map overlay to show where Miis you got in StreetPass are from, but,

1576
01:24:19,960 --> 01:24:23,320
I don't, does that mean, like, you'll literally be able to see, like, I got a hundred people

1577
01:24:23,320 --> 01:24:24,320
at Disneyland?

1578
01:24:24,320 --> 01:24:25,760
Well, Rob, it'll be nice to know where you live.

1579
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:29,840
Well, yeah, but when you specify where you live on the 3DS, they don't have GPS in them,

1580
01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:31,800
you just say California.

1581
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:34,680
You know, it'll be interesting, because I get a lot of StreetPasses at Disneyland when

1582
01:24:34,680 --> 01:24:39,080
I go, and I get a lot of people from Mexico, and I get a lot of people, of course, in California,

1583
01:24:39,080 --> 01:24:42,120
but I get all around the U.S., because, of course, Disneyland is a place for everybody

1584
01:24:42,120 --> 01:24:43,120
around the world.

1585
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:47,680
I have a shit-ton of Miis from Japan, thanks to that day we were at E3, and I StreetPass

1586
01:24:47,680 --> 01:24:52,000
with, like, 50 people in, like, five minutes, so, eh.

1587
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:57,280
You will be able to transfer software to other 3DS systems, which is good, because if, uh,

1588
01:24:57,280 --> 01:25:00,360
the inevitable, you know, Game Boy Advance games come out, and then you've got the inevitable

1589
01:25:00,360 --> 01:25:03,600
3DS upgrade that will happen next year, so, of course, you're gonna get suckered into

1590
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:06,920
buying the new 3DS, you won't lose any of the shit you got on the current DS.

1591
01:25:06,920 --> 01:25:09,760
So where's my refund for the, uh, 3DS when that happens?

1592
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:10,840
Keep on dreaming.

1593
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:16,440
And, uh, the Find Me RPG that's built into the 3DS will get a sequel if you've cleared

1594
01:25:16,440 --> 01:25:18,060
the first iteration.

1595
01:25:18,060 --> 01:25:23,640
More hats, Joy, because right now the sequel is Play the Game Again.

1596
01:25:23,640 --> 01:25:27,240
You've got a shit-load of people on that from your trips to Disneyland, and you still

1597
01:25:27,240 --> 01:25:28,240
only have...

1598
01:25:28,240 --> 01:25:32,120
No, I've beat Find Me once, and I'm on the second go-through right now, about halfway

1599
01:25:32,120 --> 01:25:33,120
through go-through number two.

1600
01:25:33,120 --> 01:25:34,120
But do you get more hats?

1601
01:25:34,120 --> 01:25:35,120
You do, actually.

1602
01:25:35,120 --> 01:25:37,840
Well, you've encountered people with these awesome-looking, like, Metroid hats and all

1603
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:40,600
this stuff, that they must have beat the game several times to get that.

1604
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:42,800
No, I have the Metroid hat and I have the crown.

1605
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:46,280
I don't have that demon hat that, like, is changed color.

1606
01:25:46,280 --> 01:25:50,360
I think that's what you get time to, because that's the last boss in Find Me, so I'm thinking

1607
01:25:50,360 --> 01:25:52,680
it's what you get on the second play-through when you beat it.

1608
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:53,680
Okay.

1609
01:25:53,680 --> 01:25:57,680
So, one puzzle piece away from having every single puzzle piece in the puzzle exchange

1610
01:25:57,680 --> 01:25:58,680
game.

1611
01:25:58,680 --> 01:26:02,400
So, I'll have that soon, too.

1612
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:07,560
Does finding every puzzle piece make your 3DS spawn another analog stick?

1613
01:26:07,560 --> 01:26:08,560
Don't think so.

1614
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:12,360
You just get pretty 3D pictures to rotate around, and the one last one I need is those

1615
01:26:12,360 --> 01:26:14,360
stupid pigmen.

1616
01:26:14,360 --> 01:26:19,900
Also, I guess there's supposed to be another new StreetPass game that's not just Find Me,

1617
01:26:19,900 --> 01:26:22,680
so I guess they're adding more for the StreetPass stuff, which is cool.

1618
01:26:22,680 --> 01:26:26,320
A few more details on Mario Kart 7 came out.

1619
01:26:26,320 --> 01:26:30,480
You will be able to do 8 player online at 60 frames a second.

1620
01:26:30,480 --> 01:26:32,880
That's pretty impressive, if true, so that'll be cool.

1621
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:35,420
You can do online or offline racing.

1622
01:26:35,420 --> 01:26:39,280
You will be able to set up communities, so you can have groups of people to race against

1623
01:26:39,280 --> 01:26:41,360
and have criteria for these communities.

1624
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:42,360
That's kind of cool.

1625
01:26:42,360 --> 01:26:45,640
If there's an OLR community way to do that, we will build one, absolutely.

1626
01:26:45,640 --> 01:26:50,760
You're going to be able to get data from other people by using StreetPass, which will be

1627
01:26:50,760 --> 01:26:54,200
win-loss records, coin data, and ghost data.

1628
01:26:54,200 --> 01:26:57,040
That's kind of cool, because that's in Ridge Racer right now, so that'll be cool to have

1629
01:26:57,040 --> 01:26:58,360
that in Mario Kart.

1630
01:26:58,360 --> 01:27:01,620
Also announced, Lakitu and Metal Mario as characters.

1631
01:27:01,620 --> 01:27:04,320
They're really stretching now, aren't they?

1632
01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:08,040
Hulu Plus will be coming to the 3DS, and the Wii.

1633
01:27:08,040 --> 01:27:13,160
Mario Kart, you can put characters from your other franchises in there.

1634
01:27:13,160 --> 01:27:18,800
You don't just have to do Mario and Donkey Kong, because Donkey Kong's not part of the

1635
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:23,840
Yeah, I know he was in the first Donkey Kong game, but the new Donkey Kong Country Crap

1636
01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:27,200
is not part of the Mario series.

1637
01:27:27,200 --> 01:27:35,320
It's its own thing, so you can put Zelda and Samus and stuff like that.

1638
01:27:35,320 --> 01:27:39,000
There's a lot more characters to use other than Metal Mario.

1639
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:40,000
That's true.

1640
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:43,240
They could be put, yeah, they could cross over, or just Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man are

1641
01:27:43,240 --> 01:27:44,240
in the arcade one.

1642
01:27:44,240 --> 01:27:47,880
I mean, I know the arcade one's made by Namco, but still, you've got that agreement.

1643
01:27:47,880 --> 01:27:52,960
Or, you know, some of the Smash Brothers characters, like, you know, some of the F-Zero characters.

1644
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:55,720
Kid Icarus and his car can fly.

1645
01:27:55,720 --> 01:27:57,040
He gets extra hang glider power.

1646
01:27:57,040 --> 01:27:58,040
Alright, anyway.

1647
01:27:58,040 --> 01:28:02,660
Hulu Plus, as I was saying, is also coming to the 3DS and the Wii soon.

1648
01:28:02,660 --> 01:28:06,400
I'm assuming it's with that upgrade, but I guess it could be even sooner.

1649
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:10,440
Hulu Plus, of course, will still cost you money to get all those TV episodes, but some

1650
01:28:10,440 --> 01:28:14,300
people are using it, especially as people are leaving Netflix, they're turning to Hulu

1651
01:28:14,300 --> 01:28:15,300
Plus.

1652
01:28:15,300 --> 01:28:19,960
So let's just pop, you use my 3DS more than I do, and you use it for Netflix a lot.

1653
01:28:19,960 --> 01:28:24,920
So if, hypothetically, if we were paying for Hulu Plus, would you be down with that?

1654
01:28:24,920 --> 01:28:30,080
The Netflix client on the 3DS, in my opinion, is really bad and laggy and awful, and it

1655
01:28:30,080 --> 01:28:34,720
times out all the time, and it's not wireless, so I would need the Hulu Plus client to be

1656
01:28:34,720 --> 01:28:35,720
better than that.

1657
01:28:35,720 --> 01:28:36,720
Interesting.

1658
01:28:36,720 --> 01:28:38,840
I didn't even realize it was that crappy.

1659
01:28:38,840 --> 01:28:42,200
What's important to note, though, is that while you might go, meh, or lol, they're still

1660
01:28:42,200 --> 01:28:46,640
supporting the Wii, Netflix, the Wii is the number one for Netflix, which surprised the

1661
01:28:46,640 --> 01:28:49,000
hell out of me, but they're in enough homes where, yeah.

1662
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:52,480
We'll look at the sales date of how many Wiis were sold, it's not that much of a stretch.

1663
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:55,040
So that's going to be big for them to get Hulu Plus.

1664
01:28:55,040 --> 01:29:00,200
I think this is kind of neat, more so than almost anything else, is that the 3DS is going

1665
01:29:00,200 --> 01:29:03,900
to be getting a messaging system called Nintendo Letterbox.

1666
01:29:03,900 --> 01:29:07,640
You will be able to send notes and photos and sounds to friends.

1667
01:29:07,640 --> 01:29:12,360
I mean, granted, you can kind of do this with what's called a cell phone, with SMS and so

1668
01:29:12,360 --> 01:29:16,080
forth, but it opens it up to younger folks if, you know, the parents are supervising

1669
01:29:16,080 --> 01:29:17,080
it.

1670
01:29:17,080 --> 01:29:20,480
Well, and they had it on the Wii, where you can send messages and photos.

1671
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:24,480
But your Wii didn't really have a camera built in, so like, I could take 3D pictures of Disneyland

1672
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:27,100
and send it to my friends and make them jealous, that'll be kind of cool.

1673
01:29:27,100 --> 01:29:29,300
So I don't know, I think it's neat.

1674
01:29:29,300 --> 01:29:33,400
I'm not like, oh my god, it's the most amazing technology ever to happen, but it seems like

1675
01:29:33,400 --> 01:29:38,240
one of those things where it's like, wow, Nintendo's finally starting to like, catch up with online

1676
01:29:38,240 --> 01:29:41,520
and starting to implement features that we were seeing in other systems like five years

1677
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:42,520
ago.

1678
01:29:42,520 --> 01:29:47,480
But at least it's forward movement, good job.

1679
01:29:47,480 --> 01:29:52,760
So lots of stuff coming out for the 3DS in November, maybe even sooner for some of this

1680
01:29:52,760 --> 01:29:53,760
other stuff.

1681
01:29:53,760 --> 01:29:54,760
So we'll see.

1682
01:29:54,760 --> 01:30:01,080
All right, meanwhile, it is time to open up the gaming vault and take a trip in and find

1683
01:30:01,080 --> 01:30:03,480
a classic video game of the week.

1684
01:30:03,480 --> 01:30:08,560
Now, DarkSakura is not here tonight, but she left a key to her house, and she left the

1685
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:09,900
vault unlocked.

1686
01:30:09,900 --> 01:30:14,040
So we made SalaciousPop go into the vault and find a game that he thinks you should

1687
01:30:14,040 --> 01:30:17,120
be playing this week, so that we wouldn't get in trouble.

1688
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:21,360
SalaciousPop, what did you find in DarkSakura's vault that is worthy of being the classic

1689
01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:22,480
game of the week?

1690
01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:28,000
One of the first and one of the best original Legend of Zelda clones for the NES, a little

1691
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:31,400
SNK RPG known as Crystallis.

1692
01:30:31,400 --> 01:30:32,400
Good pick.

1693
01:30:32,400 --> 01:30:33,400
Very good pick.

1694
01:30:33,400 --> 01:30:36,400
I was really surprised DarkSakura had never done this one, because it seems like one of

1695
01:30:36,400 --> 01:30:40,160
those things is obvious to me.

1696
01:30:40,160 --> 01:30:47,320
Crystallis was released in Japan April 13th of 1990 and came out in the US, translated

1697
01:30:47,320 --> 01:30:53,120
for the NES, three months later in July of 90.

1698
01:30:53,120 --> 01:31:00,440
It was praised for the original 8-bit NES, relatively advanced graphics, very beautiful

1699
01:31:00,440 --> 01:31:04,080
game, and also its fantastic soundtrack.

1700
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:09,920
And I usually would just forget who actually made Crystallis.

1701
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:15,920
I was thinking it was maybe one of Enix's first RPGs, but no, it was SNK, as of King

1702
01:31:15,920 --> 01:31:16,920
of Fighters fame.

1703
01:31:16,920 --> 01:31:22,840
This is an RPG they put out, and I'm sure they've had titles in Japan that may not have

1704
01:31:22,840 --> 01:31:26,480
made it over here, but I can't think of any other SNK RPGs.

1705
01:31:26,480 --> 01:31:30,320
Can you?

1706
01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:32,600
Not really, no I can't actually.

1707
01:31:32,600 --> 01:31:38,800
So yeah, this is kind of just a weird sort of anomaly, but it was a fantastic game.

1708
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:46,280
The title in Japan was God Slayer Haruka Tenku no Sonata, which is a God Slayer Sonata of

1709
01:31:46,280 --> 01:31:48,520
the Faraway Sky.

1710
01:31:48,520 --> 01:31:57,480
Part of the plot is that basically humanity built this huge powerful tower for whatever

1711
01:31:57,480 --> 01:32:03,640
nefarious reason, technology got out of control, and once this tower was built up in the sky,

1712
01:32:03,640 --> 01:32:09,840
there was some big apocalypse, and now the world is overrun with monsters.

1713
01:32:09,840 --> 01:32:17,920
You wake up in a very sort of futuristic sci-fi hibernation chamber where there's a big glass

1714
01:32:17,920 --> 01:32:21,560
door that slides open, and you come out, and you have amnesia, and you don't know what's

1715
01:32:21,560 --> 01:32:28,160
going on or who you are, and you find sort of a little old RPG town, and they're like

1716
01:32:28,160 --> 01:32:31,560
you came out of that cave, and oh my god.

1717
01:32:31,560 --> 01:32:38,040
So you have to figure out who you are, and these four sages basically say that this evil

1718
01:32:38,040 --> 01:32:44,520
dude is trying to get into the tower, the Dragonia Empire is trying to get into the

1719
01:32:44,520 --> 01:32:49,600
tower so they can go blow up the world again, and you have to find these four swords, Earth,

1720
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:55,440
Fire, Wind, Water, and you have to combine them to form Crystallus, and then only then

1721
01:32:55,440 --> 01:32:59,600
once you have that legendary sword, you can then take out the evil dude, and of course

1722
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:05,720
if you're thinking that sounds kind of Zelda-ish, at least Link to the Past and so on, then

1723
01:33:05,720 --> 01:33:11,400
you'd probably be right that the plot lines are sort of similar.

1724
01:33:11,400 --> 01:33:16,800
The water sword you could use if you swung it, you could make little ice bridges over

1725
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:20,760
narrow little streams of water, so there were some puzzle solving elements too on which

1726
01:33:20,760 --> 01:33:22,260
sword you used.

1727
01:33:22,260 --> 01:33:28,000
You also had XP, so you would gain levels and your stats would go up, and it was possible

1728
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:37,480
if you wanted to grind and min-max your way all the way up to level 99 stats with everything.

1729
01:33:37,480 --> 01:33:42,560
It had some kind of janky collision detection, where you would try to avoid a monster and

1730
01:33:42,560 --> 01:33:48,040
you would still hit it anyway, or trying to navigate some of the lava and the paths were

1731
01:33:48,040 --> 01:33:49,040
kind of weird.

1732
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:53,920
I know that it suffered from, you know like in Mega Man games when there were too many

1733
01:33:53,920 --> 01:34:00,120
sprites, it would get kind of stuttery, Crystallus had a lot of that, but otherwise it was a

1734
01:34:00,120 --> 01:34:06,720
very solid action RPG that had a lot of Final Fantasy elements with Legend of Zelda elements

1735
01:34:06,720 --> 01:34:09,420
in it too.

1736
01:34:09,420 --> 01:34:16,680
One thing to note is that two of the four sages that helped guide you in fulfilling

1737
01:34:16,680 --> 01:34:25,280
your destiny is that they were based off of Kensou and Athena, the magical girl pop star

1738
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:28,200
from King of Fighters and Sai Kensou.

1739
01:34:28,200 --> 01:34:34,080
Two of the elders are analogs of them, so that was kind of some meta fan service even

1740
01:34:34,080 --> 01:34:38,280
back then in 1990 that they had done for their previous franchise, and I believe this was

1741
01:34:38,280 --> 01:34:41,720
before King of Fighters was a thing in 1990.

1742
01:34:41,720 --> 01:34:47,760
Fatal Fury I believe was out by then, and the Athena, the platformer with Sai and Athena

1743
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:48,760
in it.

1744
01:34:48,760 --> 01:34:52,440
I was going to say, wasn't that also an NES game, like way, way, way early on?

1745
01:34:52,440 --> 01:34:56,680
Yeah, so those characters were already established and they did some fan service-y things with

1746
01:34:56,680 --> 01:34:57,680
Kensou and Athena and Crystallus.

1747
01:34:57,680 --> 01:35:02,280
Yeah, I remember seeing that in Crystallus and I was like, is that tied to the other

1748
01:35:02,280 --> 01:35:03,280
game?

1749
01:35:03,280 --> 01:35:09,400
Yeah, and there's a female character who you find who seems to have all of her memories

1750
01:35:09,400 --> 01:35:13,840
and you can tell by looking at her character model or her sprite that she's obviously from

1751
01:35:13,840 --> 01:35:18,480
the same time as you and she was hibernated in the past and awoke in the future just like

1752
01:35:18,480 --> 01:35:24,800
you were, and she kind of plays a role like Sheik in Ocarina of Time where she sort of

1753
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:29,880
shows up and gives some expositive, you know, narrative and helps you and then disappears

1754
01:35:29,880 --> 01:35:30,880
again.

1755
01:35:30,880 --> 01:35:36,240
And it turns out that both you and her are scientists that willfully froze yourself so

1756
01:35:36,240 --> 01:35:37,640
that you could reawaken.

1757
01:35:37,640 --> 01:35:41,720
Spoiler, yeah, and help save the world.

1758
01:35:41,720 --> 01:35:43,960
This is a kick-ass game.

1759
01:35:43,960 --> 01:35:44,960
This is a great game.

1760
01:35:44,960 --> 01:35:48,800
I mean, graphical problems aside, it was just so good.

1761
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:52,840
I remember it used to make my friend really sad because his birthday was October 1st and

1762
01:35:52,840 --> 01:35:56,720
when he blew up this game, he goes, October 1st, 1997, the end day.

1763
01:35:56,720 --> 01:35:59,000
That's my birthday.

1764
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:00,000
That's awesome.

1765
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,000
Oh, yeah.

1766
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:02,000
I remember that.

1767
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:05,840
It had that little in-game or cinematic.

1768
01:36:05,840 --> 01:36:06,840
Which we survived.

1769
01:36:06,840 --> 01:36:10,160
We got past the end day and then some.

1770
01:36:10,160 --> 01:36:15,960
And there are a lot of similarities with the plot and the overall styling and art direction

1771
01:36:15,960 --> 01:36:22,640
of the game that makes people think that it was influenced in part by Miyazaki's Nausicaa

1772
01:36:22,640 --> 01:36:24,760
of the Valley of the Wind.

1773
01:36:24,760 --> 01:36:30,520
The floating tower and a lot of the themes are similar.

1774
01:36:30,520 --> 01:36:39,080
And the first village that you find when you wake up from the cave is called Leaf, which

1775
01:36:39,080 --> 01:36:44,160
I believe there is a village in Nausicaa that was named the same thing.

1776
01:36:44,160 --> 01:36:46,680
Or it could just be that Leaf is kind of a common term.

1777
01:36:46,680 --> 01:36:47,680
Yeah.

1778
01:36:47,680 --> 01:36:56,080
Some of the bosses, I don't know if this is a glitch, but basically if you just spam the

1779
01:36:56,080 --> 01:37:00,680
shit out of your sword attack button, you could kind of kill bosses by just button mashing.

1780
01:37:00,680 --> 01:37:05,720
I see here that a lot of people had problems with that when there was supposed to be some

1781
01:37:05,720 --> 01:37:09,880
sort of more styled way on what weapons to use on a boss, but you kind of could ignore

1782
01:37:09,880 --> 01:37:13,960
that and just find its weak spot and beat the hell out of it.

1783
01:37:13,960 --> 01:37:14,960
But yeah, it's a great game.

1784
01:37:14,960 --> 01:37:18,200
If you have a way to play it, you should check it out.

1785
01:37:18,200 --> 01:37:21,840
Alright, your classic game of the week for the Nintendo Entertainment System and then

1786
01:37:21,840 --> 01:37:23,880
later on the Game Boy Color.

1787
01:37:23,880 --> 01:37:24,880
Crystallis.

1788
01:37:24,880 --> 01:37:26,280
Good pick.

1789
01:37:26,280 --> 01:37:28,280
Hopefully Jamie wasn't saving that one.

1790
01:37:28,280 --> 01:37:31,320
I don't know, but it's about time that one came up.

1791
01:37:31,320 --> 01:37:32,320
That's a great pick.

1792
01:37:32,320 --> 01:37:34,200
Alright, we are going to take a break, guys, but don't go anywhere.

1793
01:37:34,200 --> 01:37:38,240
We're going to come back with plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio, including some rapid

1794
01:37:38,240 --> 01:37:45,680
fire news, some early talk about Xbox and PlayStation 4, and can you believe we haven't

1795
01:37:45,680 --> 01:37:47,080
brought this game up yet tonight?

1796
01:37:47,080 --> 01:37:48,440
It's all people have been talking about all week.

1797
01:37:48,440 --> 01:37:51,240
Arkham City, we've got to talk about some things with that.

1798
01:37:51,240 --> 01:37:55,320
The mailbag, the FUs of the week, the Twitter topics, and your calls when we come back with

1799
01:37:55,320 --> 01:38:03,480
more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1800
01:38:03,480 --> 01:38:06,040
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

1801
01:38:06,040 --> 01:38:07,560
We are live tonight.

1802
01:38:07,560 --> 01:38:13,720
The 433rd episode of our show for this October the 23rd of 2011.

1803
01:38:13,720 --> 01:38:17,760
Dark Sakura, not here tonight, sadly, but taking her place and doing a mighty fine job

1804
01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:18,760
so far.

1805
01:38:18,760 --> 01:38:22,880
Salacious Pop, with a good classic game of the week, by the way.

1806
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:23,880
Very good job.

1807
01:38:23,880 --> 01:38:24,880
Thank you.

1808
01:38:24,880 --> 01:38:26,720
One of the games that came up in the last segment that I was reading a little more about

1809
01:38:26,720 --> 01:38:30,080
during the break, because I was just curious about this, Disney Universe.

1810
01:38:30,080 --> 01:38:33,440
It really does look like it's going to be just like Little Big Planet.

1811
01:38:33,440 --> 01:38:35,400
It doesn't even try to hide it.

1812
01:38:35,400 --> 01:38:39,720
But they say, I'm looking up the Wiki on it, and they're saying, well, it also kind of

1813
01:38:39,720 --> 01:38:41,280
looks like the Lego games, I guess.

1814
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:46,160
But you play through six different worlds to beat enemies, get power ups and coins.

1815
01:38:46,160 --> 01:38:50,460
And I guess you can put on costumes resembling characters from 40 classic and contemporary

1816
01:38:50,460 --> 01:38:52,640
Disney and Pixar properties.

1817
01:38:52,640 --> 01:38:55,000
Of course, the first thing I said is, is there Tron?

1818
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:56,000
Is there Tron?

1819
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:57,000
Is there Tron?

1820
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:58,000
Is there Tron?

1821
01:38:58,000 --> 01:38:59,000
There's Tron.

1822
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:00,000
Tron Legacy is one of them.

1823
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:01,560
Sadly, I don't think that's one of the worlds you'll get to fight in.

1824
01:39:01,560 --> 01:39:03,500
That would make me very sad.

1825
01:39:03,500 --> 01:39:04,720
Maybe downloadable later.

1826
01:39:04,720 --> 01:39:06,440
But I love that there's like a WALL-E and stuff too.

1827
01:39:06,440 --> 01:39:07,440
I don't know.

1828
01:39:07,440 --> 01:39:09,040
I might, I might, I might have to check this out.

1829
01:39:09,040 --> 01:39:10,720
I'm kind of a sucker for Disney stuff.

1830
01:39:10,720 --> 01:39:12,920
And Little Big Planet obviously is a great game.

1831
01:39:12,920 --> 01:39:13,920
So we'll see.

1832
01:39:13,920 --> 01:39:15,720
Of course, it's probably a $60 game.

1833
01:39:15,720 --> 01:39:16,720
Huh?

1834
01:39:16,720 --> 01:39:17,720
I don't know.

1835
01:39:17,720 --> 01:39:18,720
Uh, no.

1836
01:39:18,720 --> 01:39:19,720
Oh, it's not?

1837
01:39:19,720 --> 01:39:20,720
I think like 50.

1838
01:39:20,720 --> 01:39:21,720
Oh, well, gee, such a value.

1839
01:39:21,720 --> 01:39:23,560
Such a, it's a bargain basement.

1840
01:39:23,560 --> 01:39:24,560
Oh boy.

1841
01:39:24,560 --> 01:39:25,560
All right.

1842
01:39:25,560 --> 01:39:29,240
Let's go around and do some rapid fire news because, you know, sometimes there's a lot

1843
01:39:29,240 --> 01:39:32,040
of news and we don't have a lot of time to go too in depth, but we want to just make

1844
01:39:32,040 --> 01:39:34,580
sure we cover a few things here.

1845
01:39:34,580 --> 01:39:37,720
Sony's 3D display will be coming out November 13th.

1846
01:39:37,720 --> 01:39:45,240
Of course, it's $499 and it comes with, you know, Motorstorm Apocalypse, uh, unfortunately

1847
01:39:45,240 --> 01:39:49,600
the Resistance 3, unlike promised before, but you know, whatever.

1848
01:39:49,600 --> 01:39:54,840
Um, also of course, you know, a pair of glasses and an HDMI cable that you'll need to use

1849
01:39:54,840 --> 01:39:57,640
that with your PlayStation 3.

1850
01:39:57,640 --> 01:40:03,560
And uh, you can also buy separate sets of glasses for $70 as well.

1851
01:40:03,560 --> 01:40:07,960
And there are games supporting it so far, uh, you know, Motorstorm Apocalypse, Gran

1852
01:40:07,960 --> 01:40:14,800
Turismo 5, and Killzone 3, and Super Stardust HD all support the Simulview, um, right now

1853
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:15,800
at launch.

1854
01:40:15,800 --> 01:40:21,960
And I believe I saw that, um, Ridge Racer is supposed to be getting 3D support as well,

1855
01:40:21,960 --> 01:40:22,960
so that's kind of neat.

1856
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:26,840
Because that's a game that would probably benefit from it quite a bit.

1857
01:40:26,840 --> 01:40:31,200
Um, of course, people have been begging and pleading, you know, Valve, when are you going

1858
01:40:31,200 --> 01:40:37,640
to release some, you know, stuff I can buy for Portal, like, you know, actual Portal

1859
01:40:37,640 --> 01:40:40,840
turrets and cubes and whatnot.

1860
01:40:40,840 --> 01:40:44,440
Well, uh, you will be able to buy a Portal turret very soon.

1861
01:40:44,440 --> 01:40:50,720
Uh, it's going to be plush, which, you know, fine, that's close enough, I guess.

1862
01:40:50,720 --> 01:40:56,260
It does have a glowing red eye with a motion detector and will, of course, spout different

1863
01:40:56,260 --> 01:41:04,240
phrases from the game, and, uh, they will be going on sale mid-December on ThinkGeek,

1864
01:41:04,240 --> 01:41:06,480
is where you can purchase those.

1865
01:41:06,480 --> 01:41:11,600
Of course, also, to go along with that will be the official, um, Portal companion cube.

1866
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:14,480
I thought they already had a cuddly companion cube, or was that-

1867
01:41:14,480 --> 01:41:17,640
I think a lot of those have been, like, you know, people made them on, uh-

1868
01:41:17,640 --> 01:41:18,640
Was that, like, an Etsy ripoff?

1869
01:41:18,640 --> 01:41:23,600
Well, no, weren't there the official- they were, like, dice for your win- for your rear-view

1870
01:41:23,600 --> 01:41:24,600
mirror in your car.

1871
01:41:24,600 --> 01:41:25,600
I remember, okay, maybe it was that.

1872
01:41:25,600 --> 01:41:26,600
They keep dice.

1873
01:41:26,600 --> 01:41:32,960
This one is, uh, it's not huge, it's, like, six inches cubed, obviously, and, um, it'll

1874
01:41:32,960 --> 01:41:38,320
be available, uh, via the NECA shop, um, in November.

1875
01:41:38,320 --> 01:41:40,320
Please don't throw them in the fireplace.

1876
01:41:40,320 --> 01:41:48,240
I guess, um, that'll be, yeah, coming out, so, um, neat, I guess.

1877
01:41:48,240 --> 01:41:53,320
Like I said, I preferred that the Portal turret wasn't exactly a, uh, plush item, it kinda

1878
01:41:53,320 --> 01:41:55,880
looks stupid when it's plush.

1879
01:41:55,880 --> 01:42:02,600
You know, I'd rather a plastic thing that I can shoot bullets out of, you know.

1880
01:42:02,600 --> 01:42:03,600
I don't know.

1881
01:42:03,600 --> 01:42:08,120
Um, and then, of course, you know, to go along with Portal, there's some discussion regarding

1882
01:42:08,120 --> 01:42:15,120
the second DLC, um, expansion, which will be coming, uh, early next year, or late next

1883
01:42:15,120 --> 01:42:20,400
year, depending if it gets delayed, and, uh, it will include an in-game editor.

1884
01:42:20,400 --> 01:42:24,440
You may remember they were talking about, um, something before, saying, wouldn't it

1885
01:42:24,440 --> 01:42:29,040
be kinda cool if we could create some sort of, like, almost like a Photoshop for Portal

1886
01:42:29,040 --> 01:42:34,160
level editing that you can, you know, just very easily create your own levels?

1887
01:42:34,160 --> 01:42:35,360
Well, they're gonna do that.

1888
01:42:35,360 --> 01:42:42,360
Also, they're gonna allow, um, I guess, some additional, uh, view, play, vote on various

1889
01:42:42,360 --> 01:42:46,360
levels, that are gonna be, I think, included in this, and, um, one of the things that they're

1890
01:42:46,360 --> 01:42:52,320
gonna be adding is the ability to actually play, um, levels within the game without having

1891
01:42:52,320 --> 01:42:55,120
to actually go into the console and load up a level.

1892
01:42:55,120 --> 01:42:58,000
You'll be able to actually select user-made levels, because there's a lot of them out

1893
01:42:58,000 --> 01:42:59,000
there.

1894
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:00,000
Wow.

1895
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:01,000
Which would be awesome.

1896
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:02,000
Yeah.

1897
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:06,560
And, of course, no word if that's coming to 360, since 360 doesn't have Steam, so.

1898
01:43:06,560 --> 01:43:11,360
Wasn't Valve supposed to have some big announcement after Portal 2 came out on what their next

1899
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:12,360
project is?

1900
01:43:12,360 --> 01:43:14,360
Because, as I understand it, we don't really know-

1901
01:43:14,360 --> 01:43:15,360
Defense of the Agents.

1902
01:43:15,360 --> 01:43:16,360
Of Dota 2.

1903
01:43:16,360 --> 01:43:17,360
Oh, that's right.

1904
01:43:17,360 --> 01:43:18,360
Okay.

1905
01:43:18,360 --> 01:43:19,360
Yeah.

1906
01:43:19,360 --> 01:43:20,360
Because I was thinking, what is their next big thing that they're working on?

1907
01:43:20,360 --> 01:43:21,360
It's certainly not Half-Life.

1908
01:43:21,360 --> 01:43:22,360
Don't get me started.

1909
01:43:22,360 --> 01:43:23,360
It's still 2.

1910
01:43:23,360 --> 01:43:25,360
I mean, because they've already, you've seen, there's clips of that on YouTube, like, people

1911
01:43:25,360 --> 01:43:29,060
are already playing it at, I guess, conventions or some type of thing.

1912
01:43:29,060 --> 01:43:31,360
But then, after that, who knows?

1913
01:43:31,360 --> 01:43:32,360
So.

1914
01:43:32,360 --> 01:43:35,920
Sorry, Slice2Pop, I don't think it'll be Half-Life 3, but we'll see.

1915
01:43:35,920 --> 01:43:36,920
You never know.

1916
01:43:36,920 --> 01:43:37,920
You never know.

1917
01:43:37,920 --> 01:43:42,840
Christmas may come early this year, Slice2Pop, have you been good?

1918
01:43:42,840 --> 01:43:45,920
I think if it's gonna be anything, they're just gonna update the whole source engine

1919
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:50,880
just to do something brand new, like Half-Life 3 engine or something.

1920
01:43:50,880 --> 01:43:53,280
That's what's probably taking it so long, is they're gonna have to create a new engine

1921
01:43:53,280 --> 01:43:54,280
for it.

1922
01:43:54,280 --> 01:43:59,720
Kaijuto in our chatroom at chat.orangestop.com says, I want Portal PJs.

1923
01:43:59,720 --> 01:44:03,720
Would they be little companion cubes, or little, like, blue and orange portals, or what?

1924
01:44:03,720 --> 01:44:06,880
I saw this girl that had these portal earrings I thought were really cute, where she had

1925
01:44:06,880 --> 01:44:10,400
a blue portal on one ear and an orange one on the other, and, like, a guy running through.

1926
01:44:10,400 --> 01:44:11,920
I thought it was cute.

1927
01:44:11,920 --> 01:44:15,080
So there's a lot of cute little nerdy things out there.

1928
01:44:15,080 --> 01:44:21,040
Anyhow, moving on to some rumored, I guess, holiday-related bundles coming to the PlayStation

1929
01:44:21,040 --> 01:44:22,040
3.

1930
01:44:22,040 --> 01:44:29,240
A Mayhem Edition move bundle that will contain Killzone 3 and Resistance 3 apparently is

1931
01:44:29,240 --> 01:44:30,240
being rumored.

1932
01:44:30,240 --> 01:44:35,280
I guess this is some box factory snapshots that have leaked onto the internet.

1933
01:44:35,280 --> 01:44:39,240
Also a special edition of LittleBigPlanet 2 is supposedly on the way.

1934
01:44:39,240 --> 01:44:40,240
It's about time.

1935
01:44:40,240 --> 01:44:41,240
I've been waiting for one of those.

1936
01:44:41,240 --> 01:44:42,640
It's their Game of the Year edition, obviously.

1937
01:44:42,640 --> 01:44:46,240
Remember I said I wouldn't buy it until the Game of the Year edition came out.

1938
01:44:46,240 --> 01:44:49,160
It's November 22nd.

1939
01:44:49,160 --> 01:44:50,160
Is it cheaper?

1940
01:44:50,160 --> 01:44:51,160
Is it cheaper?

1941
01:44:51,160 --> 01:44:52,160
Is it cheaper?

1942
01:44:52,160 --> 01:44:53,160
It's the same price.

1943
01:44:53,160 --> 01:44:54,160
It's $59.99.

1944
01:44:54,160 --> 01:44:55,160
But it has all the expansions in it.

1945
01:44:55,160 --> 01:44:56,160
I guess it's cool.

1946
01:44:56,160 --> 01:44:59,880
And they're also doing a bundle that's going to have the move controller with it as well.

1947
01:44:59,880 --> 01:45:01,440
Oh, that's cool.

1948
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:06,040
Our last few trips to Target and Best Buy have been you going LittleBigPlanet 2.

1949
01:45:06,040 --> 01:45:07,040
There it is.

1950
01:45:07,040 --> 01:45:08,040
And I don't know.

1951
01:45:08,040 --> 01:45:09,920
I don't think they're doing a Game of the Year, so maybe I should pick it up this time.

1952
01:45:09,920 --> 01:45:11,920
Yeah, you can just borrow mine.

1953
01:45:11,920 --> 01:45:12,920
Really?

1954
01:45:12,920 --> 01:45:13,920
Because I think I will.

1955
01:45:13,920 --> 01:45:15,920
I haven't been playing it.

1956
01:45:15,920 --> 01:45:18,280
Yeah, heck yeah.

1957
01:45:18,280 --> 01:45:19,960
That's even cheaper than $60.

1958
01:45:19,960 --> 01:45:20,960
Alright.

1959
01:45:20,960 --> 01:45:25,880
Also, coming out very soon, like this week, Dance Central 2 is coming out.

1960
01:45:25,880 --> 01:45:27,480
A demo is already out on Xbox Live.

1961
01:45:27,480 --> 01:45:31,280
I forgot to download that and check it out, but you know, if you have a Kinect, you probably

1962
01:45:31,280 --> 01:45:33,920
already know what Dance Central is all about, but if you want to check out the new engine,

1963
01:45:33,920 --> 01:45:37,240
you can shake for free to Club Can't Handle Me.

1964
01:45:37,240 --> 01:45:39,640
That's the David Guetta song, right, with Florida.

1965
01:45:39,640 --> 01:45:43,240
And Bulletproof by LaRue.

1966
01:45:43,240 --> 01:45:47,560
Also, the rest of the songs for the game have been announced.

1967
01:45:47,560 --> 01:45:52,600
Among some of the highlights, or lowlights if you will, Justin Bieber with Somebody to

1968
01:45:52,600 --> 01:45:53,600
Love.

1969
01:45:53,600 --> 01:45:54,600
Yay.

1970
01:45:54,600 --> 01:45:55,600
Lady Gaga with Bad Romance.

1971
01:45:55,600 --> 01:45:56,600
Okay, that's cool.

1972
01:45:56,600 --> 01:45:57,600
Little Boots.

1973
01:45:57,600 --> 01:45:58,600
I like her.

1974
01:45:58,600 --> 01:45:59,600
That song called Metal.

1975
01:45:59,600 --> 01:46:00,600
That's pretty cool.

1976
01:46:00,600 --> 01:46:02,160
Sean Kingston with Fire Burning.

1977
01:46:02,160 --> 01:46:05,000
Tweet featuring Missy Elliott with Oops Oh My.

1978
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:06,440
A cover version of Toxic.

1979
01:46:06,440 --> 01:46:08,640
I guess Britney was too good.

1980
01:46:08,640 --> 01:46:14,640
And coming to Dance Central 2, Willow with Whip My Hair.

1981
01:46:14,640 --> 01:46:20,920
So lowkey, if you're planning on buying Dance Central 2, you'll hear that song once again.

1982
01:46:20,920 --> 01:46:21,920
That's lame.

1983
01:46:21,920 --> 01:46:22,920
Before you think.

1984
01:46:22,920 --> 01:46:25,700
By the way, don't forget you can import all your Dance Central 1 songs into Dance Central

1985
01:46:25,700 --> 01:46:26,700
2.

1986
01:46:26,700 --> 01:46:28,560
I think there is like a, what, five or ten dollar import fee.

1987
01:46:28,560 --> 01:46:29,560
Five bucks.

1988
01:46:29,560 --> 01:46:30,560
That's not too bad, I guess.

1989
01:46:30,560 --> 01:46:31,560
No.

1990
01:46:31,560 --> 01:46:37,440
Lastly, but not leastly, this is of great importance to Orange Lounge Radio in our history.

1991
01:46:37,440 --> 01:46:41,880
The website WhatTheyPlay.com has closed.

1992
01:46:41,880 --> 01:46:48,160
I didn't know IGN owned it, but yeah, IGN owned WhatTheyPlay.com, and it is no more.

1993
01:46:48,160 --> 01:46:51,900
On the Facebook page, I guess it was announced, well no, because they didn't really announce

1994
01:46:51,900 --> 01:46:53,880
it since February, so whatever.

1995
01:46:53,880 --> 01:46:58,360
I guess a closure notice went up or whatever, and now it just redirects to IGN.com.

1996
01:46:58,360 --> 01:47:02,140
Why this is funny, you'll have to go check the Orange Lounge Radio wiki, but one of our

1997
01:47:02,140 --> 01:47:09,040
very first dream games we ever came up with was a game called WhatTheyPlay.com Snap, and

1998
01:47:09,040 --> 01:47:10,480
you know, you'll just kind of have to go read about it.

1999
01:47:10,480 --> 01:47:16,040
It was our own little take on very offensive things in video games, according to this website,

2000
01:47:16,040 --> 01:47:18,260
all in the form of Pokemon Snap.

2001
01:47:18,260 --> 01:47:19,260
What was it?

2002
01:47:19,260 --> 01:47:22,240
Wasn't it like two guys making out with a disembodied head, shouting fuck?

2003
01:47:22,240 --> 01:47:25,700
Like I seem to recall the thing that was like so irritating about that poll was that people

2004
01:47:25,700 --> 01:47:30,500
found two guys kissing more offensive than a severed head.

2005
01:47:30,500 --> 01:47:37,560
So somehow that led to this whole discussion about WhatTheyPlay.com Snap, be it what it

2006
01:47:37,560 --> 01:47:38,560
may.

2007
01:47:38,560 --> 01:47:40,860
I don't even know what episode that was in, but I'm sure it's all on the wiki.

2008
01:47:40,860 --> 01:47:47,080
The folks that update our wiki at OrangeLoungeRadio.wiki.com, they do a fantastic job archiving some of

2009
01:47:47,080 --> 01:47:48,080
the shows and jokes.

2010
01:47:48,080 --> 01:47:49,080
It's great.

2011
01:47:49,080 --> 01:47:52,560
Slice and Pop, what do you have for us?

2012
01:47:52,560 --> 01:47:58,700
Rock Band 3 is getting some new songs, mostly Rob Zombie and White Zombie, his project before

2013
01:47:58,700 --> 01:48:01,520
he started putting stuff out under his own name.

2014
01:48:01,520 --> 01:48:05,880
They're going to be available October 25th for about $2 a song.

2015
01:48:05,880 --> 01:48:08,960
There are four of them in this update.

2016
01:48:08,960 --> 01:48:15,840
For those that remember The Darkness, that kind of retro glam metal sort of kitschy gimmick

2017
01:48:15,840 --> 01:48:20,840
band that was popular a little while ago with that song, I Believe in a Thing Called Love.

2018
01:48:20,840 --> 01:48:24,840
The guy who was in the spandex jumpsuit, that song, it's a lot of fun.

2019
01:48:24,840 --> 01:48:28,040
I can see people getting drunk and playing Rock Band to that.

2020
01:48:28,040 --> 01:48:34,400
For Rob Zombie, Living Dead Girl, and then under the White Zombie name Thunder Kiss 65,

2021
01:48:34,400 --> 01:48:41,320
which I seem to remember was a pretty badass song, and White Zombie's Super Charger Heaven.

2022
01:48:41,320 --> 01:48:45,660
And also, Super Charger Heaven is often referred to as Devil Man, because that's what's in

2023
01:48:45,660 --> 01:48:47,000
the chorus.

2024
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:50,780
I was going to ask where More Human Than Human is, but I'm like almost positive that's already

2025
01:48:50,780 --> 01:48:51,780
in the game.

2026
01:48:51,780 --> 01:48:52,780
Yeah.

2027
01:48:52,780 --> 01:48:55,320
Rock Band has a lot of songs.

2028
01:48:55,320 --> 01:48:56,960
So very cool.

2029
01:48:56,960 --> 01:49:02,760
In Peripheral News, if you remember that, I think it was from Famitsu Magazine a couple

2030
01:49:02,760 --> 01:49:09,560
weeks or months ago, the caddy for the 3DS that you pop it into, and it has an extra

2031
01:49:09,560 --> 01:49:12,640
right side analog thumby thing.

2032
01:49:12,640 --> 01:49:17,020
And people were like, well does this mean that the 3DS is going to get a new version

2033
01:49:17,020 --> 01:49:18,480
that doesn't have this as an add-on?

2034
01:49:18,480 --> 01:49:20,520
It was always going to get a new version.

2035
01:49:20,520 --> 01:49:21,520
Well yeah.

2036
01:49:21,520 --> 01:49:22,980
It's Nintendo after all.

2037
01:49:22,980 --> 01:49:31,440
So it was being bundled with Monster Hunter over in Japan, which is a huge Capcom franchise

2038
01:49:31,440 --> 01:49:32,440
over there.

2039
01:49:32,440 --> 01:49:34,480
I don't think it's nearly as popular over here.

2040
01:49:34,480 --> 01:49:36,900
But we're getting it here in the US.

2041
01:49:36,900 --> 01:49:45,120
They're saying that it's early 2012, whether that's Q1 or Q2 is what Capcom is forecasting.

2042
01:49:45,120 --> 01:49:50,360
It will be available for the Resident Evil Revelations game, which is due out February

2043
01:49:50,360 --> 01:49:51,360
7th of next year.

2044
01:49:51,360 --> 01:49:53,920
So obviously by February 7th we're going to get this thing.

2045
01:49:53,920 --> 01:49:55,880
Will a AAA battery be included?

2046
01:49:55,880 --> 01:49:58,160
Because that's what this thing runs off of apparently.

2047
01:49:58,160 --> 01:50:00,760
It doesn't know how to plug into your DS.

2048
01:50:00,760 --> 01:50:05,060
The battery life on the 3DS is already pretty bad, especially if you have something open

2049
01:50:05,060 --> 01:50:11,640
and then you just close the clamshell for sleep mode, your DS will die within an hour.

2050
01:50:11,640 --> 01:50:17,920
So my understanding is that for whether it be Resident Evil Revelations or Monster Hunter,

2051
01:50:17,920 --> 01:50:23,200
well it's nice to have this caddy thing with the extra right thumb analog thing that is

2052
01:50:23,200 --> 01:50:25,240
not mandatory.

2053
01:50:25,240 --> 01:50:31,680
So you can still play these games without the extra right side thing.

2054
01:50:31,680 --> 01:50:35,040
And if you're thinking about getting a 3DS at this point you might want to wait because

2055
01:50:35,040 --> 01:50:39,440
there's going to be I'm sure a redo next year that just has all this shit included.

2056
01:50:39,440 --> 01:50:44,280
Unless you must play Mario Kart 7 or one of the other games that's coming out soon, which

2057
01:50:44,280 --> 01:50:45,600
I can't say I blame you.

2058
01:50:45,600 --> 01:50:47,760
I'm really excited about that Mario game to be honest.

2059
01:50:47,760 --> 01:50:51,240
So for those of us that were, for the early adopters who thought that it was just a horrible

2060
01:50:51,240 --> 01:50:53,640
nightmare and you were hallucinating, no it's real.

2061
01:50:53,640 --> 01:50:55,520
It's real and we're getting it.

2062
01:50:55,520 --> 01:50:59,400
And that's what you get, I'm kidding.

2063
01:50:59,400 --> 01:51:05,680
Finally and I have maybe a little resentment that Rob gave me this story to report on,

2064
01:51:05,680 --> 01:51:11,240
but Karaoke Revolution Glee Volume 3, it's the best show ever, oh my god what's going

2065
01:51:11,240 --> 01:51:17,320
to happen with Mercedes, is coming out on the Xbox 360 and Wii November 22nd.

2066
01:51:17,320 --> 01:51:19,760
Glee, glee, glee.

2067
01:51:19,760 --> 01:51:21,760
Haven't the ratings for that show really dipped though?

2068
01:51:21,760 --> 01:51:23,360
Like people are kind of getting over it.

2069
01:51:23,360 --> 01:51:28,720
Like I heard that other Fox show, the Fox show with that one girl who just looks surprised,

2070
01:51:28,720 --> 01:51:30,560
like she looks like a deer in the headlights all that.

2071
01:51:30,560 --> 01:51:31,560
What's her name?

2072
01:51:31,560 --> 01:51:32,560
Zoe?

2073
01:51:32,560 --> 01:51:33,560
Zoe Deschanel.

2074
01:51:33,560 --> 01:51:34,560
Yes, her.

2075
01:51:34,560 --> 01:51:37,840
Her show is like beating glee and it comes on like after it or something.

2076
01:51:37,840 --> 01:51:41,640
So like glee is like it's fading fast.

2077
01:51:41,640 --> 01:51:44,000
It's one of those flash in the pan shows probably.

2078
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:48,440
Yeah and of course Konami is putting this out obviously because it's Karaoke Revolution

2079
01:51:48,440 --> 01:51:54,720
and the glee merchandise I think now is, and all the licensing and the glee brand and all

2080
01:51:54,720 --> 01:51:59,240
the CDs and the shit that they put out is a bigger, probably it's a bigger brand than

2081
01:51:59,240 --> 01:52:00,920
the actual series.

2082
01:52:00,920 --> 01:52:04,040
All the crap that they're slapping the franchise onto.

2083
01:52:04,040 --> 01:52:06,320
How many Sue Silvestres are you going to see this Halloween?

2084
01:52:06,320 --> 01:52:11,280
And that's how Sue sees, I have to admit she was the only funny thing on that show as much

2085
01:52:11,280 --> 01:52:14,140
of a cartoon as that character is.

2086
01:52:14,140 --> 01:52:16,640
It's like the only reason to watch it.

2087
01:52:16,640 --> 01:52:22,320
I could care less about white kids with problems.

2088
01:52:22,320 --> 01:52:24,240
It was all about Sue Silvestre to me.

2089
01:52:24,240 --> 01:52:27,600
So yeah, glee, Karaoke Revolution, whoop to shit.

2090
01:52:27,600 --> 01:52:28,600
That's my last story.

2091
01:52:28,600 --> 01:52:29,600
All right.

2092
01:52:29,600 --> 01:52:33,400
And by the way, that's like the only way Karaoke Revolution lives on right now.

2093
01:52:33,400 --> 01:52:38,040
I think that's the funniest thing out of all of it is that Karaoke Revolution, remember

2094
01:52:38,040 --> 01:52:44,440
when Harmonix co-did the first Karaoke Revolution game and it was really this whole new thing?

2095
01:52:44,440 --> 01:52:47,640
This is what your series turned into.

2096
01:52:47,640 --> 01:52:51,360
Don't stop believin'.

2097
01:52:51,360 --> 01:52:56,540
Hey, let's travel around and get some more news.

2098
01:52:56,540 --> 01:52:59,280
We are also going to be coming up to the mailbag very soon.

2099
01:52:59,280 --> 01:53:03,880
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us your emails and Twitter topics

2100
01:53:03,880 --> 01:53:08,900
coming later as well as your last chance to get those in at Twitter.com slash O-L-R. So

2101
01:53:08,900 --> 01:53:11,440
at O-L-R on Twitter.

2102
01:53:11,440 --> 01:53:12,440
All right, Loki.

2103
01:53:12,440 --> 01:53:18,120
Well, of course, everyone's always talking about what's going to be next for the Xbox

2104
01:53:18,120 --> 01:53:19,120
and PlayStation.

2105
01:53:19,120 --> 01:53:27,200
Well, of course, the rumor is that the next Xbox system is going to be slated for 2013.

2106
01:53:27,200 --> 01:53:34,720
And they're saying with Nintendo revealing its Wii U console at E3, it's kind of pushed

2107
01:53:34,720 --> 01:53:38,160
them to release their system faster.

2108
01:53:38,160 --> 01:53:48,080
And apparently the site, well, the site develop is saying, their source is saying that apparently

2109
01:53:48,080 --> 01:53:53,320
they have a source from the processor chip manufacturers to middleware firms that they're

2110
01:53:53,320 --> 01:54:02,180
expecting an E3 2013 reveal of the console, followed by a launch later in the year.

2111
01:54:02,180 --> 01:54:09,800
And it could be as far away as early 2014, which that's almost a 10-year life cycle.

2112
01:54:09,800 --> 01:54:12,360
I mean, that's like eight, nine years.

2113
01:54:12,360 --> 01:54:15,440
Yeah, it can't really get too fussy about eight years.

2114
01:54:15,440 --> 01:54:16,440
That's a good run for me.

2115
01:54:16,440 --> 01:54:21,560
Yeah, I mean, what, the PlayStation 1 was out in two, or the PlayStation, well, the

2116
01:54:21,560 --> 01:54:23,440
PlayStation 1 was what, 96, 95?

2117
01:54:23,440 --> 01:54:24,440
Yeah, I think 95.

2118
01:54:24,440 --> 01:54:25,920
That was when Toshinden hit.

2119
01:54:25,920 --> 01:54:28,120
And then PlayStation 2 was 2001.

2120
01:54:28,120 --> 01:54:29,120
So that was...

2121
01:54:29,120 --> 01:54:30,120
No, 2000.

2122
01:54:30,120 --> 01:54:31,120
2000.

2123
01:54:31,120 --> 01:54:32,120
Okay.

2124
01:54:32,120 --> 01:54:33,120
It was nine...

2125
01:54:33,120 --> 01:54:34,120
A five-year.

2126
01:54:34,120 --> 01:54:35,120
Yeah.

2127
01:54:35,120 --> 01:54:36,120
And then to the PlayStation 2 was 2006.

2128
01:54:36,120 --> 01:54:37,120
God, I can't count.

2129
01:54:37,120 --> 01:54:38,960
PlayStation 3 was 2006.

2130
01:54:38,960 --> 01:54:40,320
So that was a six-year.

2131
01:54:40,320 --> 01:54:44,160
So if this pushes, what, seven or eight, that's pretty good.

2132
01:54:44,160 --> 01:54:48,200
The hardware is finally plateauing to the point where you can have sustainable graphics for

2133
01:54:48,200 --> 01:54:49,200
eight years.

2134
01:54:49,200 --> 01:54:50,200
That's great.

2135
01:54:50,200 --> 01:54:54,640
I think, though, that the Xbox needs it more than the PlayStation.

2136
01:54:54,640 --> 01:54:58,920
I still feel like the PlayStation's power hasn't been fully realized because a lot of

2137
01:54:58,920 --> 01:54:59,920
people have to...

2138
01:54:59,920 --> 01:55:02,800
I know this sounds so fanboyish, but hear me out, you guys.

2139
01:55:02,800 --> 01:55:03,800
Let's be real.

2140
01:55:03,800 --> 01:55:06,680
At the end of the day, the Blu-ray can hold more than the DVDs can.

2141
01:55:06,680 --> 01:55:09,440
So I think that...

2142
01:55:09,440 --> 01:55:12,680
I know it's slower and all that, but all those games install anyway.

2143
01:55:12,680 --> 01:55:19,920
But I think that once the new Xbox comes out, then the PlayStation 3 is gonna be that bottom

2144
01:55:19,920 --> 01:55:20,920
bar.

2145
01:55:20,920 --> 01:55:23,440
But I think people will be able to really fill up those discs with textures and high

2146
01:55:23,440 --> 01:55:25,160
resolutions and so forth.

2147
01:55:25,160 --> 01:55:28,840
I kind of just think the PlayStation 3 hasn't fully been realized yet.

2148
01:55:28,840 --> 01:55:29,840
So we'll see.

2149
01:55:29,840 --> 01:55:34,540
And usually the renaissance of a certain system is usually the latter three or four years

2150
01:55:34,540 --> 01:55:37,300
of its cycle rather than the first four.

2151
01:55:37,300 --> 01:55:41,160
And it's not necessarily the end of the life cycle, because they could still be considering

2152
01:55:41,160 --> 01:55:42,160
doing their 10-year life cycle.

2153
01:55:42,160 --> 01:55:43,160
It can go...

2154
01:55:43,160 --> 01:55:44,160
Oh, yeah.

2155
01:55:44,160 --> 01:55:45,160
Because it's a thing of the PS2.

2156
01:55:45,160 --> 01:55:46,160
Games came out for the PS2 forever.

2157
01:55:46,160 --> 01:55:49,200
There's still games coming out for the PS2.

2158
01:55:49,200 --> 01:55:52,360
So it could coexist with it for a few years after.

2159
01:55:52,360 --> 01:55:56,240
I wouldn't be surprised to be able to push it over 10 years.

2160
01:55:56,240 --> 01:55:57,240
So that's interesting.

2161
01:55:57,240 --> 01:55:59,080
Well, that's the theory, at least.

2162
01:55:59,080 --> 01:56:03,760
So I guess we'll have to wait and see, only a couple of years away before an announcement.

2163
01:56:03,760 --> 01:56:06,880
I would imagine we'd get an announcement sooner than later anyways.

2164
01:56:06,880 --> 01:56:11,360
Microsoft established with the 360 that you can actually come out first with a whole year

2165
01:56:11,360 --> 01:56:13,120
of head time and still win.

2166
01:56:13,120 --> 01:56:14,740
Well, what am I...

2167
01:56:14,740 --> 01:56:19,240
Why am I thinking it's between the 360 and the PS3 when the Wii has outsold both of them?

2168
01:56:19,240 --> 01:56:23,840
I was going to say, because usually the console that came out first was the one that fell

2169
01:56:23,840 --> 01:56:24,880
on its ass.

2170
01:56:24,880 --> 01:56:28,780
Because we're all looking at the Wii U going, you know, maybe lightning's not going to strike

2171
01:56:28,780 --> 01:56:31,120
twice this time.

2172
01:56:31,120 --> 01:56:32,120
That's why.

2173
01:56:32,120 --> 01:56:33,120
You know what?

2174
01:56:33,120 --> 01:56:38,320
Seriously, the Wii U, I'm kind of disappointed with the fact that they aren't going to try

2175
01:56:38,320 --> 01:56:44,000
to up the graphics to, yeah, okay, it's slightly better than 360.

2176
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:48,040
It's going to have to be slightly better than that because the 360's going to be done with

2177
01:56:48,040 --> 01:56:50,000
by the time that it comes out.

2178
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:55,880
So if it's a good system, Microsoft can have a year head star on everyone and win, ultimately,

2179
01:56:55,880 --> 01:56:57,440
the market.

2180
01:56:57,440 --> 01:57:02,600
I mean, Nintendo will have a chance, though, at next year's E3 to really wow the shit out

2181
01:57:02,600 --> 01:57:03,600
of us.

2182
01:57:03,600 --> 01:57:07,560
I mean, the nice thing about where Nintendo's going, they get a second chance.

2183
01:57:07,560 --> 01:57:12,240
So next year, if they can do it, they can put out games that have fucking sweet graphics

2184
01:57:12,240 --> 01:57:14,880
that use this whole tablet thing that just blow our fucking mind.

2185
01:57:14,880 --> 01:57:15,880
Like, they have a chance.

2186
01:57:15,880 --> 01:57:18,160
I've got a prediction for you.

2187
01:57:18,160 --> 01:57:20,460
It's not going to be ready for next year.

2188
01:57:20,460 --> 01:57:21,460
It's not going to be ready.

2189
01:57:21,460 --> 01:57:22,460
You think.

2190
01:57:22,460 --> 01:57:23,460
You're calling the Wii U delay already.

2191
01:57:23,460 --> 01:57:25,540
Wii U is not coming out in 2012.

2192
01:57:25,540 --> 01:57:26,540
You think.

2193
01:57:26,540 --> 01:57:28,440
And do you think it's because of its cold reception?

2194
01:57:28,440 --> 01:57:29,860
I think it's because they got nothing.

2195
01:57:29,860 --> 01:57:30,860
They have nothing.

2196
01:57:30,860 --> 01:57:33,080
They have a bunch of tech demos and that's it.

2197
01:57:33,080 --> 01:57:34,200
Proof of concept, that's it.

2198
01:57:34,200 --> 01:57:35,260
Here's the problem.

2199
01:57:35,260 --> 01:57:40,240
If the 3DS doesn't make a recovery this holiday, and I don't know, I still think it's too early

2200
01:57:40,240 --> 01:57:41,240
to say.

2201
01:57:41,240 --> 01:57:43,840
The Wii U, the Mario Kart, and the Mario games are going to go a long way in putting these

2202
01:57:43,840 --> 01:57:46,000
things under kids' Christmas trees this year.

2203
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:51,200
But if the 3DS doesn't gain a lot of steam quickly, what are they going to have next

2204
01:57:51,200 --> 01:57:53,200
year?

2205
01:57:53,200 --> 01:57:55,140
Nothing.

2206
01:57:55,140 --> 01:57:58,640
It's going to really put pressure on to get the Wii U out or they're going to have to

2207
01:57:58,640 --> 01:58:00,440
give in to investors and start making iPhone games.

2208
01:58:00,440 --> 01:58:01,440
Yeah.

2209
01:58:01,440 --> 01:58:02,440
But see, when they're going to be...

2210
01:58:02,440 --> 01:58:03,440
Yeah, but that's the thing.

2211
01:58:03,440 --> 01:58:07,780
If they're going to rush the Wii U, come on.

2212
01:58:07,780 --> 01:58:11,080
We're going to see these games that, oh, we were developing this for the Wii, but we decided

2213
01:58:11,080 --> 01:58:15,360
to put it on the Wii U type situation.

2214
01:58:15,360 --> 01:58:16,360
And I know that...

2215
01:58:16,360 --> 01:58:17,360
Like the last story.

2216
01:58:17,360 --> 01:58:24,040
Nintendo has been the more family-friendly, affordable model since, really, the N64.

2217
01:58:24,040 --> 01:58:27,520
I don't like the fact that the tablet controller is a terminal.

2218
01:58:27,520 --> 01:58:29,320
It doesn't have any processor in it.

2219
01:58:29,320 --> 01:58:31,280
It's simply a screen.

2220
01:58:31,280 --> 01:58:35,000
I think Nintendo needs to realize that people are fucking buying iPads for their goddamn

2221
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:37,560
kids and iPads aren't fucking cheap.

2222
01:58:37,560 --> 01:58:41,120
You can make your console more expensive and people will still buy it.

2223
01:58:41,120 --> 01:58:42,680
They're not going to go, oh my god.

2224
01:58:42,680 --> 01:58:43,680
Don't give them too many ideas.

2225
01:58:43,680 --> 01:58:48,760
Well, I understand that, but I'm just saying, you know, if you're buying a fucking $200

2226
01:58:48,760 --> 01:58:56,680
piece of equipment for your child, I mean, shit, I think they will spend $300 on a console.

2227
01:58:56,680 --> 01:59:01,960
Brad from PotCulture's in our chat room and wants me to make a bet with Loki.

2228
01:59:01,960 --> 01:59:02,960
Stop it.

2229
01:59:02,960 --> 01:59:03,960
Stop it, okay?

2230
01:59:03,960 --> 01:59:07,280
You had your chance and you blew it.

2231
01:59:07,280 --> 01:59:14,240
All you had to do was generate a few sales, a few hundred thousand sales of, you know,

2232
01:59:14,240 --> 01:59:18,200
I have judgment, and that was it, and then you would have had it.

2233
01:59:18,200 --> 01:59:24,880
But see, the Wii U does sound ridiculous, but once again, it's something like, all these

2234
01:59:24,880 --> 01:59:26,480
developers are so excited.

2235
01:59:26,480 --> 01:59:31,640
I think that these developers seriously don't get enough sun because it's, oh wow, it's

2236
01:59:31,640 --> 01:59:32,640
a tablet that interacts-

2237
01:59:32,640 --> 01:59:34,480
Do you think they all have vitamin D deficiencies?

2238
01:59:34,480 --> 01:59:37,520
It's like it's a tablet that interacts with this console.

2239
01:59:37,520 --> 01:59:39,640
Dude, they've got like tablets-

2240
01:59:39,640 --> 01:59:41,560
And the tablet does shit by itself.

2241
01:59:41,560 --> 01:59:44,560
You need the console tethered to it.

2242
01:59:44,560 --> 01:59:45,840
But you know what, though?

2243
01:59:45,840 --> 01:59:51,960
It's not, you say that like it's a bad thing, but look at like, you know, the on-live stuff.

2244
01:59:51,960 --> 01:59:57,920
It's a console that interacts with a server that basically streams the gaming to it.

2245
01:59:57,920 --> 01:59:58,920
True.

2246
01:59:58,920 --> 02:00:00,180
That's the same thing.

2247
02:00:00,180 --> 02:00:05,000
But once again, I'm like, that tablet looks stupid.

2248
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:09,520
And yeah, ooh goody, we can put my, you know, my inventory down on this.

2249
02:00:09,520 --> 02:00:13,380
You know what, you could do that also with the 3, you know, the DS or something.

2250
02:00:13,380 --> 02:00:17,640
You can have it where it interacts with the actual consoles on, you know, the DS could

2251
02:00:17,640 --> 02:00:18,640
do that.

2252
02:00:18,640 --> 02:00:20,520
Same with the 3DS could do that.

2253
02:00:20,520 --> 02:00:22,440
But they didn't fucking do that.

2254
02:00:22,440 --> 02:00:29,200
I don't know, it's just, they're gonna need a lot more than what they've got.

2255
02:00:29,200 --> 02:00:34,480
Alright, let's move on to a game that's supposed to be on the Wii U when it comes out.

2256
02:00:34,480 --> 02:00:35,480
Arkham City.

2257
02:00:35,480 --> 02:00:38,280
Now, people have been going apeshit for this game.

2258
02:00:38,280 --> 02:00:42,440
I haven't played it, but I've watched Dan play a little bit of it.

2259
02:00:42,440 --> 02:00:44,560
And it did look pretty fucking sweet, I gotta say.

2260
02:00:44,560 --> 02:00:46,160
And like, you know, I like Batman.

2261
02:00:46,160 --> 02:00:50,360
I don't know why I didn't buy this game at launch, but I guess I'm just not, I'm not

2262
02:00:50,360 --> 02:00:54,120
usually very good at the 3D action games, I think that's kind of part of it.

2263
02:00:54,120 --> 02:00:59,000
But there's a part of me that's going kind of want with this game.

2264
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:03,960
But then I read this crap, and I go, maybe I shouldn't buy it right away.

2265
02:01:03,960 --> 02:01:07,840
Remember how we've been talking about Project $10 applies to this game, and it's not even

2266
02:01:07,840 --> 02:01:08,840
multiplayer.

2267
02:01:08,840 --> 02:01:09,840
No, they've done the Catwoman.

2268
02:01:09,840 --> 02:01:11,900
Well, they have to run the servers!

2269
02:01:11,900 --> 02:01:14,560
You understand, they have to run the servers!

2270
02:01:14,560 --> 02:01:15,560
Think of the servers!

2271
02:01:15,560 --> 02:01:18,720
You know what really, the only thing that ticks me off about the whole thing is that

2272
02:01:18,720 --> 02:01:23,160
they really made Catwoman sound like she was an integral part of the game, and like it's

2273
02:01:23,160 --> 02:01:24,160
all part of it.

2274
02:01:24,160 --> 02:01:25,760
And now it's DLC.

2275
02:01:25,760 --> 02:01:27,000
You know, essentially.

2276
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:31,120
Which I'm fine, you know, it's not like it's the first time we've seen a game come with

2277
02:01:31,120 --> 02:01:32,380
DLC in it.

2278
02:01:32,380 --> 02:01:33,880
That happens a lot now.

2279
02:01:33,880 --> 02:01:39,240
You know, it's just the whole, you know, buy the game new incentive, whatever.

2280
02:01:39,240 --> 02:01:42,240
But paid unlocked content, because that was a key.

2281
02:01:42,240 --> 02:01:46,800
No, I don't, I think it's like a, I was listening to Bobby show earlier, and one of his callers

2282
02:01:46,800 --> 02:01:48,720
said it was a 200 megabyte download.

2283
02:01:48,720 --> 02:01:49,720
Really?

2284
02:01:49,720 --> 02:01:50,720
Yeah.

2285
02:01:50,720 --> 02:01:52,080
So it must come with others, alright.

2286
02:01:52,080 --> 02:01:54,160
Do some investigative reporting, Loki.

2287
02:01:54,160 --> 02:01:56,260
Meanwhile, okay, here's the deal.

2288
02:01:56,260 --> 02:01:59,200
The thing that kind of, you know, ticked me off and made me go, maybe I shouldn't have

2289
02:01:59,200 --> 02:02:00,200
rushed into this.

2290
02:02:00,200 --> 02:02:04,080
Apparently, those download codes are showing up, and they don't work.

2291
02:02:04,080 --> 02:02:06,840
Some of them don't work, some of them are just fucking blank.

2292
02:02:06,840 --> 02:02:10,780
And there's a picture circulating around the internet of cards that went into boxes with

2293
02:02:10,780 --> 02:02:12,280
no codes on them.

2294
02:02:12,280 --> 02:02:16,160
And actually, from a factory production standpoint, this makes a lot of sense.

2295
02:02:16,160 --> 02:02:19,560
They probably have an assembly line and a machine that picks up these cards and runs

2296
02:02:19,560 --> 02:02:23,640
them through a printer, and the machine probably, if it picks up two at a time on accident,

2297
02:02:23,640 --> 02:02:24,960
which is bound to happen.

2298
02:02:24,960 --> 02:02:27,880
Why this ever can't happen to me at the ATM machine, I don't know.

2299
02:02:27,880 --> 02:02:31,840
But in the factory, it picks up two at a time, and then one of them doesn't get a code, yet

2300
02:02:31,840 --> 02:02:33,440
still goes in the game.

2301
02:02:33,440 --> 02:02:34,800
So yeah.

2302
02:02:34,800 --> 02:02:38,280
So it was going out there, and these people that were looking forward to playing as Catwoman

2303
02:02:38,280 --> 02:02:39,680
were kind of screwed.

2304
02:02:39,680 --> 02:02:43,960
However, Warner does have a five-step process to get this fixed.

2305
02:02:43,960 --> 02:02:45,120
Alright, fair enough.

2306
02:02:45,120 --> 02:02:46,880
It was a couple hundred meg download.

2307
02:02:46,880 --> 02:02:47,880
Alright.

2308
02:02:47,880 --> 02:02:48,880
So be it.

2309
02:02:48,880 --> 02:02:52,880
Alright, so apparently you call customer service, and you give them a dated proof of purchase,

2310
02:02:52,880 --> 02:02:57,680
like a receipt, that shows a new copy of the game, not eBay or not rented.

2311
02:02:57,680 --> 02:03:02,920
You have to give your gamer tag for Xbox Live or PSN, you have to give your email address,

2312
02:03:02,920 --> 02:03:07,840
a scan or digital picture of the package and game disk, and the scan or digital picture

2313
02:03:07,840 --> 02:03:08,840
of the code sheet.

2314
02:03:08,840 --> 02:03:11,280
Once you send all that in, they'll give you the code.

2315
02:03:11,280 --> 02:03:13,480
That's a lot of work for their mistake.

2316
02:03:13,480 --> 02:03:14,880
I know, right?

2317
02:03:14,880 --> 02:03:17,320
I seem to recall last time a developer fucked up.

2318
02:03:17,320 --> 02:03:19,480
Wasn't it Deus Ex that had this problem?

2319
02:03:19,480 --> 02:03:24,520
One of those had a code, and it got fucked up, so they just ended up having to give it

2320
02:03:24,520 --> 02:03:25,520
to everybody.

2321
02:03:25,520 --> 02:03:26,520
It was Driver.

2322
02:03:26,520 --> 02:03:27,520
It was Driver.

2323
02:03:27,520 --> 02:03:28,520
It was Driver.

2324
02:03:28,520 --> 02:03:30,520
Driver, they forgot to put the code in one of the packages.

2325
02:03:30,520 --> 02:03:35,080
I think it was 360 or PS3, I can't remember, it was one of those two.

2326
02:03:35,080 --> 02:03:39,880
They forgot to put in the Uplay code.

2327
02:03:39,880 --> 02:03:44,360
But this is apparently like, people, this is going back to the days of when people would

2328
02:03:44,360 --> 02:03:48,320
call in sick to work and stay up all night to play a video game.

2329
02:03:48,320 --> 02:03:50,680
This game is having that effect on people.

2330
02:03:50,680 --> 02:03:55,880
People that I know that aren't even that into video games are just going apeshit crazy over

2331
02:03:55,880 --> 02:03:56,880
this.

2332
02:03:56,880 --> 02:04:02,360
And trust me, people, if you really want to get this free code and maybe purchase a used

2333
02:04:02,360 --> 02:04:08,840
copy already, I mean, come on, you need a picture of the packed shot and a receipt?

2334
02:04:08,840 --> 02:04:12,240
I think we can find one on Google Image Search.

2335
02:04:12,240 --> 02:04:13,720
I love this.

2336
02:04:13,720 --> 02:04:18,600
Tigerclaw linked a picture in chatroom of a midnight launch at his local Evil G, and

2337
02:04:18,600 --> 02:04:23,320
one of the employees is dressed up as the Joker with the why so serious makeup.

2338
02:04:23,320 --> 02:04:27,160
At least people are getting into it.

2339
02:04:27,160 --> 02:04:28,160
Lol.

2340
02:04:28,160 --> 02:04:30,240
Shame on you for giving that place your business.

2341
02:04:30,240 --> 02:04:31,800
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

2342
02:04:31,800 --> 02:04:36,260
This is where I'm going to get in my sandbox once again about this whole code crap.

2343
02:04:36,260 --> 02:04:42,160
So I would like to pose this question, and I'm sure no developers of these types of games

2344
02:04:42,160 --> 02:04:46,540
actually listen to this show, but maybe after we hopefully win the podcast awards, someone

2345
02:04:46,540 --> 02:04:50,800
will go back in the archives and hear my rant.

2346
02:04:50,800 --> 02:04:58,200
So I always hear the complaint, or I should say the argument from people in favor of these

2347
02:04:58,200 --> 02:05:05,240
$10 codes and online passes and stuff, well, the developers don't get any money from used

2348
02:05:05,240 --> 02:05:06,240
sales.

2349
02:05:06,240 --> 02:05:10,760
They just don't get any money, and those servers cost money to maintain blah blah blah blah

2350
02:05:10,760 --> 02:05:11,760
blah.

2351
02:05:11,760 --> 02:05:15,520
Okay, developers, how much of that $10 do you actually get?

2352
02:05:15,520 --> 02:05:21,800
Because I'm going to be willing to bet that you get nothing from those $10 vouchers that

2353
02:05:21,800 --> 02:05:24,340
get redeemed or whatever.

2354
02:05:24,340 --> 02:05:30,760
I'm betting it's $0 is what you get, and it all goes to the publisher to pad their numbers,

2355
02:05:30,760 --> 02:05:35,060
and yeah, some of that I'm sure will go to running their servers, because hey, if you

2356
02:05:35,060 --> 02:05:40,280
can run your servers cheaper than you are now, then why not?

2357
02:05:40,280 --> 02:05:46,920
But I mean, it's just an excuse, and no, I'm sure buying these games used is not going

2358
02:05:46,920 --> 02:05:53,240
to make or break a publisher as far as that goes, because I'm being willing to bet that

2359
02:05:53,240 --> 02:05:57,520
none of that money goes to the developers, all probably to the publishers.

2360
02:05:57,520 --> 02:05:58,520
You want proof.

2361
02:05:58,520 --> 02:06:00,560
I want to see the receipts.

2362
02:06:00,560 --> 02:06:05,400
I want someone to say, hey, we get a buck for each time someone buys this thing.

2363
02:06:05,400 --> 02:06:07,960
That's what I'd like to see, but I doubt it.

2364
02:06:07,960 --> 02:06:11,000
I doubt that they get very much money from that.

2365
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:12,720
All right.

2366
02:06:12,720 --> 02:06:15,220
Let's move on to the mailbag.

2367
02:06:15,220 --> 02:06:19,780
Every week you guys send us emails at mailbag at orangelauncheradio.com.

2368
02:06:19,780 --> 02:06:24,000
Now normally DarkSakura will dive into the email bag head first and pull out some of

2369
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:25,840
her favorite emails to read on air.

2370
02:06:25,840 --> 02:06:31,000
However, as you guys are aware, she's not here tonight, so she has asked SalaciousPop

2371
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:35,040
to put on the biohazard suit and jump in there on her behalf.

2372
02:06:35,040 --> 02:06:38,280
So SalaciousPop, what's in the emails tonight?

2373
02:06:38,280 --> 02:06:43,260
First email tonight is from Robert M and he writes, evening, you probably already got

2374
02:06:43,260 --> 02:06:48,680
feedback about this, but the free downloadable Zelda Four Swords is not a 3DS exclusive,

2375
02:06:48,680 --> 02:06:51,800
but it's available on the DSI models as well.

2376
02:06:51,800 --> 02:06:56,040
I am very glad to see that they added a single player mode, allowing the player to have a

2377
02:06:56,040 --> 02:06:59,880
second link, follow him around and switch control to either character.

2378
02:06:59,880 --> 02:07:04,020
Overall this is the kind of effort Nintendo should be putting into its rereleases.

2379
02:07:04,020 --> 02:07:07,440
Now onto toys!

2380
02:07:07,440 --> 02:07:14,560
I have had and not had an interest in Spyro since the Insomniac days, and while I sympathize

2381
02:07:14,560 --> 02:07:20,480
with the storage issues and definitely the high buy-in, the concept of Skylander seems

2382
02:07:20,480 --> 02:07:25,800
kind of cool, even though I'm sure the game itself would probably be fairly simplistic.

2383
02:07:25,800 --> 02:07:30,980
I've seen other game-slash-toys like this, although those were probably an in-package

2384
02:07:30,980 --> 02:07:35,560
code rather than direct peripheral transfer of memory.

2385
02:07:35,560 --> 02:07:40,240
Some online racing games with toy cars, and some MMO called Freaky Creatures whose action

2386
02:07:40,240 --> 02:07:42,200
figures I've seen at Best Buy.

2387
02:07:42,200 --> 02:07:45,480
I haven't seen either of these in stores for a while though.

2388
02:07:45,480 --> 02:07:49,840
I haven't seen as much integration with my Transformers action figures, a line here and

2389
02:07:49,840 --> 02:07:54,880
there may have a catalog with a code for an unlockable in one of the games, but these

2390
02:07:54,880 --> 02:07:57,880
are rare and all the catalogs have the same code.

2391
02:07:57,880 --> 02:08:03,440
My question is, have you seen a more successful toy game integration?

2392
02:08:03,440 --> 02:08:08,920
Would you call those music games toys, like the plastic guitars, are those toys?

2393
02:08:08,920 --> 02:08:10,920
It kind of depends on your definition of toy.

2394
02:08:10,920 --> 02:08:17,880
Well I think what he's asking is, what was that card game for the Sony that bombed that

2395
02:08:17,880 --> 02:08:18,880
never came out?

2396
02:08:18,880 --> 02:08:19,880
Eye of Judgment?

2397
02:08:19,880 --> 02:08:21,460
Yeah, Eye of Judgment.

2398
02:08:21,460 --> 02:08:25,640
That's where you're kind of buying a physical thing to bring into the game.

2399
02:08:25,640 --> 02:08:28,560
With the Skylanders you have to find these little action figures to play that character

2400
02:08:28,560 --> 02:08:29,560
in the game.

2401
02:08:29,560 --> 02:08:31,560
So what have there been that's similar to that?

2402
02:08:31,560 --> 02:08:36,780
Well you have to go from the disc generations forward because obviously with the cartridge

2403
02:08:36,780 --> 02:08:39,000
scenario that just didn't happen.

2404
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:45,500
I remember old school VCR games that tied in with toys, but that stuff didn't work very

2405
02:08:45,500 --> 02:08:49,560
well and it was all just for show in the commercials and stuff.

2406
02:08:49,560 --> 02:08:54,160
But as far as toys with games, I'm not sure.

2407
02:08:54,160 --> 02:08:58,520
And Loki, can you think of anything, any type of, like where they sold toys that integrated

2408
02:08:58,520 --> 02:09:00,040
with the game like this does?

2409
02:09:00,040 --> 02:09:01,040
That integrated the game?

2410
02:09:01,040 --> 02:09:02,040
Yeah.

2411
02:09:02,040 --> 02:09:08,640
Connectimals, they had little scans where you can basically interact with different,

2412
02:09:08,640 --> 02:09:12,240
you know, you can buy toys, or they had collector's editions that came with stuffed animals they

2413
02:09:12,240 --> 02:09:14,840
could play with the actual game with.

2414
02:09:14,840 --> 02:09:18,040
Viva Pinata had some stuff.

2415
02:09:18,040 --> 02:09:19,040
Did Viva Pinata have that?

2416
02:09:19,040 --> 02:09:21,320
Yeah, they had a little thing where you could scan your...

2417
02:09:21,320 --> 02:09:25,200
Yeah, they so tried to make Viva Pinata happen.

2418
02:09:25,200 --> 02:09:27,380
They tried, it wasn't going to happen.

2419
02:09:27,380 --> 02:09:30,520
Some people enjoyed it, some people really did, but like remember they had the cartoon,

2420
02:09:30,520 --> 02:09:33,960
they were really trying to make an empire out of that and it just...

2421
02:09:33,960 --> 02:09:38,320
If you want to count Babysitting Mama, because Babysitting Mama had the doll that you shoved

2422
02:09:38,320 --> 02:09:43,640
the Wii remote up into its nether regions and would interact that way.

2423
02:09:43,640 --> 02:09:47,120
Don't worry, Mama will fix it.

2424
02:09:47,120 --> 02:09:48,600
Let's see, what else?

2425
02:09:48,600 --> 02:09:49,600
There was...

2426
02:09:49,600 --> 02:09:53,280
Cat rooms yelling Captain Power, I think that's what they're thinking of the VCR stuff I'm

2427
02:09:53,280 --> 02:09:54,280
talking about.

2428
02:09:54,280 --> 02:09:55,280
Oh, wow.

2429
02:09:55,280 --> 02:09:56,280
Right?

2430
02:09:56,280 --> 02:09:57,940
Yeah, I remember that.

2431
02:09:57,940 --> 02:09:59,640
That was kind of like a rich kid's toy.

2432
02:09:59,640 --> 02:10:01,760
That shit was, well that shit was cheap as hell, though.

2433
02:10:01,760 --> 02:10:10,320
I didn't ever own one, but you know, I had the rich friends, and so, you know, they did.

2434
02:10:10,320 --> 02:10:14,460
That's what you do when you're poor, you make friends with rich people.

2435
02:10:14,460 --> 02:10:16,400
Through your sass and wit.

2436
02:10:16,400 --> 02:10:21,640
Alright, Salacious Pop, what's next?

2437
02:10:21,640 --> 02:10:29,080
Chiggers writes asking, rather, asking Dark Sakura, who's not here, an update on her PlayStation

2438
02:10:29,080 --> 02:10:30,320
tester application.

2439
02:10:30,320 --> 02:10:33,880
I can actually give you that, even though Dark Sakura's not here tonight.

2440
02:10:33,880 --> 02:10:37,680
She decided not to go through with it, and it was a discussion between her and Dan about

2441
02:10:37,680 --> 02:10:40,900
the whole, like, if I actually got it, I have to relocate.

2442
02:10:40,900 --> 02:10:43,600
Keep in mind, Dan just recently got employed again.

2443
02:10:43,600 --> 02:10:47,760
He was working a game crazy up until they all went under, and he's employed again, so

2444
02:10:47,760 --> 02:10:51,800
they made a personal decision that it's just not the right time for Dark Sakura to do that.

2445
02:10:51,800 --> 02:10:56,040
As funny as it would have been, she has to think not just for herself.

2446
02:10:56,040 --> 02:11:01,720
You know, she has a husband, so they didn't go through with it, which is too bad.

2447
02:11:01,720 --> 02:11:04,800
Unfortunately, Salacious Pop's application got in too late, right?

2448
02:11:04,800 --> 02:11:06,680
No, I'm just kidding.

2449
02:11:06,680 --> 02:11:07,680
Just messing.

2450
02:11:07,680 --> 02:11:11,440
I just want to see you go on that show and claw some 21-year-old's eyes out for being

2451
02:11:11,440 --> 02:11:12,440
a bitch.

2452
02:11:12,440 --> 02:11:14,240
Yeah, I'm probably too old.

2453
02:11:14,240 --> 02:11:15,240
I'm sure it's like on...

2454
02:11:15,240 --> 02:11:16,240
You'd be Grandpa on that show.

2455
02:11:16,240 --> 02:11:17,240
Because on the...

2456
02:11:17,240 --> 02:11:22,480
There's usually one or two people in their 30s that are in the cast somehow, but yeah.

2457
02:11:22,480 --> 02:11:29,480
They have one that I watched just because, and it was just the part of it, because Freddie

2458
02:11:29,480 --> 02:11:33,120
Wong is in it briefly.

2459
02:11:33,120 --> 02:11:36,480
He posted it on his Facebook page, but it's like some battlefield thing called the Controller.

2460
02:11:36,480 --> 02:11:41,240
It's a bunch of these noobs team up with, like, these pro gamers, and they have to play

2461
02:11:41,240 --> 02:11:42,560
Battlefield 3.

2462
02:11:42,560 --> 02:11:45,000
It's basically a big advertisement for Battlefield 3.

2463
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:49,960
But yeah, all those shows are dumb.

2464
02:11:49,960 --> 02:11:52,520
Tester.

2465
02:11:52,520 --> 02:11:54,680
You can test games for the PlayStation 4!

2466
02:11:54,680 --> 02:11:57,200
No, remember, the next one had a different prize.

2467
02:11:57,200 --> 02:11:59,840
It's not about just the game testing now.

2468
02:11:59,840 --> 02:12:01,780
They sweetened the deal a little bit.

2469
02:12:01,780 --> 02:12:03,280
The prize sounds a lot better.

2470
02:12:03,280 --> 02:12:06,520
And we'll kick you in the nuts!

2471
02:12:06,520 --> 02:12:09,240
I don't know what happened to the second guy that won.

2472
02:12:09,240 --> 02:12:10,840
I know a gay guy won the second season.

2473
02:12:10,840 --> 02:12:12,960
His handle was, like, gamer.

2474
02:12:12,960 --> 02:12:16,000
And I haven't heard a lot about what happened to him, but I knew the guy that won the first

2475
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:20,760
season actually only tested for, like, six months, and he moved into the part at Sony

2476
02:12:20,760 --> 02:12:22,920
that he really wanted to do.

2477
02:12:22,920 --> 02:12:25,660
That whole thing was really about just getting your foot in the damn door.

2478
02:12:25,660 --> 02:12:28,800
But I'd be curious about did they hire anyone else from the shows.

2479
02:12:28,800 --> 02:12:31,960
You know how sometimes, like, American Idol, right?

2480
02:12:31,960 --> 02:12:33,160
Chris Daughtry didn't win.

2481
02:12:33,160 --> 02:12:35,800
If you're in the top three, you're getting a record deal.

2482
02:12:35,800 --> 02:12:36,800
Exactly.

2483
02:12:36,800 --> 02:12:37,800
Exactly.

2484
02:12:37,800 --> 02:12:38,800
Yeah.

2485
02:12:38,800 --> 02:12:44,040
Uh, next email is from Jam J. Jam J writes, Holy shit, I haven't heard that name in forever.

2486
02:12:44,040 --> 02:12:47,080
That guy used to show up live a lot.

2487
02:12:47,080 --> 02:12:56,080
This week, I picked up Rocksmith for the 360, a, uh, I'm not sure, a 14 to USB connector

2488
02:12:56,080 --> 02:12:58,080
for the guitar was included.

2489
02:12:58,080 --> 02:13:03,440
My thoughts on the game itself is that it is more of a training slash drill tool than

2490
02:13:03,440 --> 02:13:07,280
game, and then parentheses, number cruncher, or number munchers.

2491
02:13:07,280 --> 02:13:12,220
For many, this would be a turnoff, but as an extreme novice at guitar, I found it was

2492
02:13:12,220 --> 02:13:16,120
decent and made otherwise boring practice a bit better.

2493
02:13:16,120 --> 02:13:20,660
The game functions as an amplifier for the guitar and has a free mode where you can just

2494
02:13:20,660 --> 02:13:22,280
free play your guitar.

2495
02:13:22,280 --> 02:13:26,120
I would recommend Rocksmith for those that want to learn a bit of guitar, but aren't

2496
02:13:26,120 --> 02:13:30,520
taking normal lessons or excuse me, aren't taking formal lessons.

2497
02:13:30,520 --> 02:13:34,700
One of the drawbacks is that you have to grind songs repetitively, repetitively in order

2498
02:13:34,700 --> 02:13:36,360
to open up new modes.

2499
02:13:36,360 --> 02:13:39,840
However, it does make you practice.

2500
02:13:39,840 --> 02:13:44,180
After the 30 minutes of, after the 30 minutes of starting the game, I found I was able to

2501
02:13:44,180 --> 02:13:49,120
play a simplified version of Satisfaction, which wasn't bad at all.

2502
02:13:49,120 --> 02:13:52,320
I used a basic Strat style electric guitar.

2503
02:13:52,320 --> 02:13:55,920
Rocksmith will work with any electric guitar with a quarter, oh, that's probably a quarter

2504
02:13:55,920 --> 02:13:58,120
inch, with a quarter inch jack.

2505
02:13:58,120 --> 02:14:02,720
I give this game the Tomato Frog stamp of approval for learning basic guitar.

2506
02:14:02,720 --> 02:14:03,720
GMJ.

2507
02:14:03,720 --> 02:14:05,640
Well, that actually is not a bad review.

2508
02:14:05,640 --> 02:14:10,240
You know, I like that he says it's more of a tool than a game.

2509
02:14:10,240 --> 02:14:15,280
And I'd be curious to see how much this catches on, if at all.

2510
02:14:15,280 --> 02:14:19,840
I mean, I think people are like, they're just too ready to throw it into the rock band and

2511
02:14:19,840 --> 02:14:22,680
guitar hero pile than to see what it really is.

2512
02:14:22,680 --> 02:14:26,840
But I appreciate the review because this was something that I don't, I gotta admit, I don't

2513
02:14:26,840 --> 02:14:30,880
really have a super duper interest in learning to play the guitar, but it sounds like a neat

2514
02:14:30,880 --> 02:14:32,120
way to learn.

2515
02:14:32,120 --> 02:14:37,480
I'm more of a keyboard person, keep in mind, piano, that stuff.

2516
02:14:37,480 --> 02:14:43,760
And our last email of the evening is from Fabrice in Belgium and he writes, hello, OLR.

2517
02:14:43,760 --> 02:14:47,160
I love international emails, just saying.

2518
02:14:47,160 --> 02:14:51,720
I went to my very first sci-fi convention last Saturday and it was simply amazing.

2519
02:14:51,720 --> 02:14:54,340
The people cosplaying just blew my mind away.

2520
02:14:54,340 --> 02:14:59,080
Most of their costumes were made that well and they played their part with so much conviction.

2521
02:14:59,080 --> 02:15:02,000
Wow, it really made a big impression on me.

2522
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:06,880
The overall atmosphere and friendship between cosplayers made me, made me consider to cosplay

2523
02:15:06,880 --> 02:15:07,880
myself.

2524
02:15:07,880 --> 02:15:12,520
I didn't see anyone cosplaying Pyramid Head, I'm thinking about filling up that gap next

2525
02:15:12,520 --> 02:15:14,560
year on this convention.

2526
02:15:14,560 --> 02:15:18,640
Although I don't know too much about him, I've never had a chance, I've never had a

2527
02:15:18,640 --> 02:15:20,040
chance to play Silent Hill.

2528
02:15:20,040 --> 02:15:22,920
He looks like such a badass character.

2529
02:15:22,920 --> 02:15:24,760
And then I have Halloween's coming.

2530
02:15:24,760 --> 02:15:26,680
You really should check out Silent Hill, just saying.

2531
02:15:26,680 --> 02:15:28,700
I have something to whine about too.

2532
02:15:28,700 --> 02:15:32,500
It seems that every single game has downloadable content nowadays.

2533
02:15:32,500 --> 02:15:37,640
As I was randomly going through the Xbox Live Marketplace, I saw there was even downloadable

2534
02:15:37,640 --> 02:15:41,720
content for such a small and simple game as Fruit Ninja Connect.

2535
02:15:41,720 --> 02:15:45,720
I do get that developers and publishers want to make some more extra money, but it's just

2536
02:15:45,720 --> 02:15:46,720
crazy.

2537
02:15:46,720 --> 02:15:50,080
It feels more and more like content that should be included in the game when you first buy

2538
02:15:50,080 --> 02:15:52,280
it.

2539
02:15:52,280 --> 02:15:56,400
In two years time, if this trend continues, we will only buy half games for the full price.

2540
02:15:56,400 --> 02:16:00,160
I hate to say it, this trend's already been going for a long time, and a lot of this is,

2541
02:16:00,160 --> 02:16:02,640
you know, IOS has a lot of this too.

2542
02:16:02,640 --> 02:16:06,040
This is just kind of the world we live in right now, and you really have to vote with

2543
02:16:06,040 --> 02:16:07,080
your dollars.

2544
02:16:07,080 --> 02:16:09,040
Don't buy half-assed games.

2545
02:16:09,040 --> 02:16:10,040
Don't.

2546
02:16:10,040 --> 02:16:11,040
Do your research.

2547
02:16:11,040 --> 02:16:14,220
Well, as always, thanks a lot for making the show every week.

2548
02:16:14,220 --> 02:16:15,480
You guys really are awesome.

2549
02:16:15,480 --> 02:16:18,640
I'm voting almost every day for you guys for the podcast awards.

2550
02:16:18,640 --> 02:16:20,320
That's the least I can do for you.

2551
02:16:20,320 --> 02:16:21,680
Aw, shucks.

2552
02:16:21,680 --> 02:16:22,680
Shucks.

2553
02:16:22,680 --> 02:16:23,680
Thanks so much.

2554
02:16:23,680 --> 02:16:24,680
Fabrice in Belgium.

2555
02:16:24,680 --> 02:16:25,720
Really appreciate it, Fabrice.

2556
02:16:25,720 --> 02:16:29,160
You know, his story about the sci-fi convention and all the excitement that kind of went with

2557
02:16:29,160 --> 02:16:30,160
that and kind of...

2558
02:16:30,160 --> 02:16:32,780
I bet a lot of that excitement is just being with other nerds.

2559
02:16:32,780 --> 02:16:37,560
I know that, like, my first E3 was a lot like that, was, like, all these professional people

2560
02:16:37,560 --> 02:16:39,960
that really happen to be, like, big fucking nerds like me.

2561
02:16:39,960 --> 02:16:40,960
Like, I just...

2562
02:16:40,960 --> 02:16:44,800
I loved my first E3, and I don't think I'll ever go to one as good as that because of

2563
02:16:44,800 --> 02:16:45,800
that.

2564
02:16:45,800 --> 02:16:48,360
But, like, it just reminded me of some other thing I read this week.

2565
02:16:48,360 --> 02:16:49,360
Did you see...

2566
02:16:49,360 --> 02:16:50,360
Here I go.

2567
02:16:50,360 --> 02:16:51,360
Opening Pandora's box.

2568
02:16:51,360 --> 02:16:52,360
Woo!

2569
02:16:52,360 --> 02:16:53,360
There was some magazine.

2570
02:16:53,360 --> 02:16:57,560
It was Men's Health that did this piece on New York Comic-Con, and they just basically

2571
02:16:57,560 --> 02:17:01,200
sent a photographer there to take pictures of fat cosplayers to put it on their website

2572
02:17:01,200 --> 02:17:02,200
and make fun of them.

2573
02:17:02,200 --> 02:17:07,040
Like, you know, guys dressed as Captain America or something like that that have, like, the

2574
02:17:07,040 --> 02:17:10,400
beer bellies and things like that, and I was just like...

2575
02:17:10,400 --> 02:17:12,880
It's obviously Men's Health, so I don't know if they're just trying to make people feel

2576
02:17:12,880 --> 02:17:16,560
bad about themselves, so they'll subscribe to the magazine to, I don't know, get health

2577
02:17:16,560 --> 02:17:19,660
tips, but the whole thing just came off as hella fucking rude.

2578
02:17:19,660 --> 02:17:23,960
And like, you know, obviously Twitter and the internet, rightfully so, is pissed and

2579
02:17:23,960 --> 02:17:24,960
demanding an apology.

2580
02:17:24,960 --> 02:17:26,080
I don't know if they ever got one.

2581
02:17:26,080 --> 02:17:34,000
I didn't follow the story that much, but it's just, ugh, just so classless, like, but it's

2582
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:37,800
just all reason not to get that magazine, I suppose, that they're just gonna be rude

2583
02:17:37,800 --> 02:17:38,800
like that.

2584
02:17:38,800 --> 02:17:44,240
Like, who even in a boardroom, I mean, office, or a story editor, thinks that's funny.

2585
02:17:44,240 --> 02:17:49,000
Let's go to New York Comic-Con and take pictures of fat people, and we'll put them in the magazine.

2586
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:51,920
That's like what the bullies did in high school.

2587
02:17:51,920 --> 02:17:55,400
Let's go pick on the fags and put them in the trash can, huh huh.

2588
02:17:55,400 --> 02:17:58,580
It's just ridiculous.

2589
02:17:58,580 --> 02:18:01,560
Shame on everybody involved with that.

2590
02:18:01,560 --> 02:18:06,840
And to the people that have the guts to dress up like in tights when they may not have perfect

2591
02:18:06,840 --> 02:18:09,320
bodies, I say props to you.

2592
02:18:09,320 --> 02:18:12,680
Props to you for having the guts to get out there and do that, because those people that

2593
02:18:12,680 --> 02:18:15,800
write for the magazines often won't even put their fucking pictures in the mag.

2594
02:18:15,800 --> 02:18:18,160
Let's see a picture of the guy that wrote that article, see what he looks like.

2595
02:18:18,160 --> 02:18:21,480
I bet he's not perfect.

2596
02:18:21,480 --> 02:18:22,800
And then one last thing.

2597
02:18:22,800 --> 02:18:29,480
We did get your email, DKPopman, and also a shout out for The Doctor 90125, but what

2598
02:18:29,480 --> 02:18:32,720
you talked about is actually coming up in just a few minutes, but we got your email.

2599
02:18:32,720 --> 02:18:33,720
Hello, DKPopman.

2600
02:18:33,720 --> 02:18:35,560
Well, hello and thank you.

2601
02:18:35,560 --> 02:18:41,520
We always don't have time to write, do every email either, and I think that's important

2602
02:18:41,520 --> 02:18:42,520
to keep in mind.

2603
02:18:42,520 --> 02:18:43,520
That's it for mailbag.

2604
02:18:43,520 --> 02:18:44,520
But we do read them all.

2605
02:18:44,520 --> 02:18:45,520
Thank you.

2606
02:18:45,520 --> 02:18:50,320
I just posted that actually his show, Anime Jam Session, a friend of ours, actually wrote

2607
02:18:50,320 --> 02:18:52,940
this whole counter article to it.

2608
02:18:52,940 --> 02:18:54,240
I'm not going to reread the whole thing.

2609
02:18:54,240 --> 02:18:55,720
He's posted it in chat.

2610
02:18:55,720 --> 02:18:59,040
The whole thing is infuriating enough where I really don't want to spend any more time

2611
02:18:59,040 --> 02:19:05,000
talking about it, but if you just want to see reasons why you should be mad, go read

2612
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:07,040
it.

2613
02:19:07,040 --> 02:19:14,960
You don't have to be fat to support fat rights, because how does that old saying go?

2614
02:19:14,960 --> 02:19:20,680
At first they didn't come for me, and I said nothing, and then they came for me and no

2615
02:19:20,680 --> 02:19:21,680
one said anything.

2616
02:19:21,680 --> 02:19:22,680
Something like that.

2617
02:19:22,680 --> 02:19:24,800
Somebody in chat will remind me what that is.

2618
02:19:24,800 --> 02:19:29,480
Alright, anyhow, let's move on with some more news.

2619
02:19:29,480 --> 02:19:38,080
It's hard to believe that this damn thing is so popular, but Angry Birds.

2620
02:19:38,080 --> 02:19:43,600
They're getting a film, and why?

2621
02:19:43,600 --> 02:19:49,040
Did they really run out of that many ideas that they have to create a movie based on

2622
02:19:49,040 --> 02:19:50,040
this game?

2623
02:19:50,040 --> 02:19:53,640
It doesn't make any sense, but anyways, the game's been downloaded over 400 million times,

2624
02:19:53,640 --> 02:19:59,680
so they probably think, hey, you know what, let me make some money off that movie.

2625
02:19:59,680 --> 02:20:06,760
And of course, their revenue, Rovio was currently valued at 1.2 billion dollars, which is ridiculous.

2626
02:20:06,760 --> 02:20:10,120
Ridiculous, I say.

2627
02:20:10,120 --> 02:20:17,120
And to kind of go along with that, Ubisoft, they have a wonderful franchise called Assassin's

2628
02:20:17,120 --> 02:20:22,280
Creed, and Sony has apparently bought the rights to make a movie based on it, and this

2629
02:20:22,280 --> 02:20:30,480
is coming from also the fact that Sony has just recently started registering a bunch

2630
02:20:30,480 --> 02:20:38,120
of websites for an Assassin's Creed movie, so that's a good indicator.

2631
02:20:38,120 --> 02:20:39,680
Assassin's Creed might make a pretty good movie.

2632
02:20:39,680 --> 02:20:42,760
I think it could, because it actually has a pretty decent storyline to go along with

2633
02:20:42,760 --> 02:20:44,640
it, so I can see that.

2634
02:20:44,640 --> 02:20:47,080
I see it more so than Angry Birds, that's for sure.

2635
02:20:47,080 --> 02:20:49,960
Angry Birds has no plot, other than, you know, it's just-

2636
02:20:49,960 --> 02:20:51,200
They're mad at pigs.

2637
02:20:51,200 --> 02:20:57,400
There's pigs, and they did something that angered the birds, and so you launch, I mean,

2638
02:20:57,400 --> 02:21:00,680
I don't want to watch a movie where it's just birds flinging themselves at walls all

2639
02:21:00,680 --> 02:21:01,680
movie long.

2640
02:21:01,680 --> 02:21:06,560
I remember growing up in the 80s when Saturday morning cartoons were a thing, and you had

2641
02:21:06,560 --> 02:21:11,200
these really awful Saturday morning cartoons that were only on for a season that promoted

2642
02:21:11,200 --> 02:21:14,480
the toys, and the toys were there to promote the cartoon.

2643
02:21:14,480 --> 02:21:18,400
Why not just have an Angry Birds cartoon, right?

2644
02:21:18,400 --> 02:21:19,840
I mean-

2645
02:21:19,840 --> 02:21:21,720
Makes sense.

2646
02:21:21,720 --> 02:21:28,000
But again, little kids don't have $400 smartphones to play the damn game on, but yeah, it's like,

2647
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:29,000
why can't you just-

2648
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:31,360
But you can play the game on almost everything now.

2649
02:21:31,360 --> 02:21:35,080
Well yeah, it's on Google Plus, and the port on Google Plus is actually pretty good, but

2650
02:21:35,080 --> 02:21:38,680
it's like, I just remember, why can't you just make a cartoon series to sell some plastic

2651
02:21:38,680 --> 02:21:40,240
shit and be done with it?

2652
02:21:40,240 --> 02:21:43,240
I don't know why it needs a movie.

2653
02:21:43,240 --> 02:21:44,240
That's all.

2654
02:21:44,240 --> 02:21:50,000
Well, hearing about Angry Birds movies make me angry, and when we get angry, we rage,

2655
02:21:50,000 --> 02:22:06,320
and it's the F-You's of the Week.

2656
02:22:06,320 --> 02:22:20,080
Sure, I guess, um, F-You to waking up with headaches, which is weird, because it's like

2657
02:22:20,080 --> 02:22:21,080
I was asleep, I should feel awesome if I have a headache.

2658
02:22:21,080 --> 02:22:24,080
It got better, though, after once I got to brunch and ate, so just headaches are annoying.

2659
02:22:24,080 --> 02:22:25,640
They make me sad.

2660
02:22:25,640 --> 02:22:26,640
Headaches suck.

2661
02:22:26,640 --> 02:22:27,640
I agree.

2662
02:22:27,640 --> 02:22:28,640
Yeah.

2663
02:22:28,640 --> 02:22:29,640
Loki!

2664
02:22:29,640 --> 02:22:33,440
F-You to waiting.

2665
02:22:33,440 --> 02:22:34,440
Wait longer.

2666
02:22:34,440 --> 02:22:35,440
No!

2667
02:22:35,440 --> 02:22:40,160
He wants to get home right now and go hunting for some stuff.

2668
02:22:40,160 --> 02:22:45,560
Alright, uh, my F-You of the Week goes to the fact that, um, well look, here's the deal.

2669
02:22:45,560 --> 02:22:47,760
I'm never gonna pay to go to BlizzCon.

2670
02:22:47,760 --> 02:22:52,640
Like, let's be real, I'm not gonna pay to go play a couple of demos.

2671
02:22:52,640 --> 02:22:53,640
Like, what do they want?

2672
02:22:53,640 --> 02:22:58,120
About 150 bucks and sit on panels that I can read live blogs on the internet for free.

2673
02:22:58,120 --> 02:23:02,360
However, F-You to the fact that I wasn't smart enough to take the time off anyway to drive

2674
02:23:02,360 --> 02:23:08,400
down to Anaheim and go to DizCon, which was today, and, uh, just go to the parties.

2675
02:23:08,400 --> 02:23:09,400
Like, seriously.

2676
02:23:09,400 --> 02:23:10,960
Like, slices pop, am I right?

2677
02:23:10,960 --> 02:23:15,000
We should've just gone to Disneyland Friday, Saturday, and then went to the BlizzCon parties

2678
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:16,000
at night, right?

2679
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:17,000
Yeah.

2680
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:18,000
Totally.

2681
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:19,000
We're so stupid!

2682
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:24,680
Oops, I'm so mad that the frickin' outro's playing now.

2683
02:23:24,680 --> 02:23:27,760
Alright.

2684
02:23:27,760 --> 02:23:31,240
Let's move on with some more gaming news and then of course Twitter topics and the Skype

2685
02:23:31,240 --> 02:23:33,200
line coming very soon.

2686
02:23:33,200 --> 02:23:36,600
Uh, 3D Classics is this thing on the 3DS.

2687
02:23:36,600 --> 02:23:40,320
You know, they redid Excitebike and, like, Urban Champion for some weird reason and there's

2688
02:23:40,320 --> 02:23:42,440
been some other things in there as well, like Twinbee.

2689
02:23:42,440 --> 02:23:45,920
Uh, apparently the next game that will be out for 3D Classics, this is kind of a big

2690
02:23:45,920 --> 02:23:46,920
one.

2691
02:23:46,920 --> 02:23:47,920
Kid Icarus.

2692
02:23:47,920 --> 02:23:49,760
The old school classic, that's right.

2693
02:23:49,760 --> 02:23:52,560
This one is being, uh, done in 3D.

2694
02:23:52,560 --> 02:23:55,640
Now of course that just means, you know, some of the sprites will be on different layers

2695
02:23:55,640 --> 02:24:00,060
and eh, I don't think it'll be that big of a deal, but it's probably just being re-released

2696
02:24:00,060 --> 02:24:04,320
to kind of raise awareness because of course they do have the Kid Icarus game coming out

2697
02:24:04,320 --> 02:24:06,640
next year, so there you go.

2698
02:24:06,640 --> 02:24:10,120
Nintendo has also pledged that they will be increasing the amount of 3D Classics that

2699
02:24:10,120 --> 02:24:11,160
we see.

2700
02:24:11,160 --> 02:24:12,860
Why not?

2701
02:24:12,860 --> 02:24:16,960
It's super easy to program these, I'm sure, and it's a way to get you to buy virtual console

2702
02:24:16,960 --> 02:24:18,320
games all over again.

2703
02:24:18,320 --> 02:24:22,640
It's like, do I really need to be reminded how bloody hard that game was?

2704
02:24:22,640 --> 02:24:24,320
But seriously, that game is so fucking good.

2705
02:24:24,320 --> 02:24:28,280
Like I know some people say you remember it through rose-colored glasses and it's not

2706
02:24:28,280 --> 02:24:31,200
that good, but like, the music is amazing.

2707
02:24:31,200 --> 02:24:34,360
The dungeon levels are hard as hell and they're fun.

2708
02:24:34,360 --> 02:24:37,040
Like, I'm just worried that- I had to use the codes out in Nintendo Power

2709
02:24:37,040 --> 02:24:38,960
Magazine to get any progress in that game.

2710
02:24:38,960 --> 02:24:41,920
Icarus fights Medusa Angels, or whatever it is.

2711
02:24:41,920 --> 02:24:45,360
Medusa fights Icarus Angels, you get the reverse.

2712
02:24:45,360 --> 02:24:48,240
My whole thing is that I'm really worried that if I were to purchase this, that the

2713
02:24:48,240 --> 02:24:52,360
first time I get fucked over by an eggplant wizard, I'm gonna throw my 3DS against the

2714
02:24:52,360 --> 02:24:55,200
wall like I used to throw my Nintendo controllers.

2715
02:24:55,200 --> 02:24:58,840
Because those eggplant wizards are fucking bastards.

2716
02:24:58,840 --> 02:25:06,120
And that music that plays when they get mad and they're like, you trolled me, yeah!

2717
02:25:06,120 --> 02:25:07,120
Oh my god.

2718
02:25:07,120 --> 02:25:09,280
Did you play a lot of Kid Icarus when you were younger?

2719
02:25:09,280 --> 02:25:10,280
Oh yeah.

2720
02:25:10,280 --> 02:25:11,280
Flash's Pop?

2721
02:25:11,280 --> 02:25:12,280
Yeah.

2722
02:25:12,280 --> 02:25:13,280
Oh god, it's one of my favorites.

2723
02:25:13,280 --> 02:25:14,280
That's what I played.

2724
02:25:14,280 --> 02:25:16,600
I completely missed the original Metroid train for the NES and I was playing Kid Icarus instead.

2725
02:25:16,600 --> 02:25:17,640
Wait, here you go.

2726
02:25:17,640 --> 02:25:19,800
Let's see if this music makes you think of the eggplant wizards.

2727
02:25:19,800 --> 02:25:20,800
Oh god.

2728
02:25:20,800 --> 02:25:21,800
You ready?

2729
02:25:21,800 --> 02:25:25,360
I'm ready.

2730
02:25:25,360 --> 02:25:33,000
That little sound they made, right?

2731
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:37,600
Yeah, when they saw you, they were very animated and upset and they squeaked at you.

2732
02:25:37,600 --> 02:25:39,040
And the little babies flew out.

2733
02:25:39,040 --> 02:25:41,920
And then you had to go see that nurse who kind of looked like a trapezoid.

2734
02:25:41,920 --> 02:25:46,400
Like what was up with that?

2735
02:25:46,400 --> 02:25:47,400
Nurse trapezoid.

2736
02:25:47,400 --> 02:25:50,040
I need the eggplant curse removed.

2737
02:25:50,040 --> 02:25:55,400
Alright, anyhow, Flash's Pop, what do you have for us?

2738
02:25:55,400 --> 02:26:02,560
Soulcalibur V is getting a crossover franchise tie-in that makes sense and it's not Star

2739
02:26:02,560 --> 02:26:05,560
Wars with Vader and Yoda and it's so good.

2740
02:26:05,560 --> 02:26:08,360
I gotta say, Starkiller was awesome though in the game.

2741
02:26:08,360 --> 02:26:10,840
Yeah, well, he's a nice looking gentleman.

2742
02:26:10,840 --> 02:26:12,640
He's based off a real person, isn't he?

2743
02:26:12,640 --> 02:26:15,880
Sam Witwer, the actor, yeah, is Starkiller.

2744
02:26:15,880 --> 02:26:17,880
But anyway.

2745
02:26:17,880 --> 02:26:21,600
How often are you thinking about this guy?

2746
02:26:21,600 --> 02:26:23,200
Tapping my fingers on the desk.

2747
02:26:23,200 --> 02:26:30,280
Enzo from Assassin's Creed, the last few Assassin's Creed games, is in Soulcalibur V and it looks

2748
02:26:30,280 --> 02:26:35,440
super badass and he fits in stylistically with everyone.

2749
02:26:35,440 --> 02:26:39,160
It was one of those things when they announced that, I was like, oh, I didn't think of that.

2750
02:26:39,160 --> 02:26:40,160
But it makes sense.

2751
02:26:40,160 --> 02:26:45,600
It's better than Kratos in Mortal Kombat and even that was reasonable.

2752
02:26:45,600 --> 02:26:50,920
So yeah, Enzo is in Soulcalibur V, it's confirmed, I believe there are screenshots.

2753
02:26:50,920 --> 02:26:56,000
And there's another little promotional tidbit that they've released for us.

2754
02:26:56,000 --> 02:27:04,480
There is a special pre-order bonus character named Dump here and he is very wacky and silly.

2755
02:27:04,480 --> 02:27:12,920
He's kind of a vaudeville circus MC with a hat and sort of like a villainous, the curly

2756
02:27:12,920 --> 02:27:19,040
mustache that ties the damsel in distress on the railroad tracks.

2757
02:27:19,040 --> 02:27:23,920
And he's got striped pants and he's very nutty.

2758
02:27:23,920 --> 02:27:27,720
And you should watch the gameplay trailer of him doing his moves and it's like, this

2759
02:27:27,720 --> 02:27:29,520
guy is nuts.

2760
02:27:29,520 --> 02:27:31,520
But you get to make your own characters again, right?

2761
02:27:31,520 --> 02:27:32,520
I believe so.

2762
02:27:32,520 --> 02:27:34,320
Because I remember, was it Soulcalibur III or IV?

2763
02:27:34,320 --> 02:27:35,320
I think it was you, Loki.

2764
02:27:35,320 --> 02:27:37,760
It must have been III because it must have been back when we were living together when

2765
02:27:37,760 --> 02:27:41,760
Soulcalibur III came out and you made that character named Benedict that looked like

2766
02:27:41,760 --> 02:27:42,760
the poet.

2767
02:27:42,760 --> 02:27:43,760
Well, that wasn't you.

2768
02:27:43,760 --> 02:27:44,760
I thought that was.

2769
02:27:44,760 --> 02:27:45,760
Was that X-Defer?

2770
02:27:45,760 --> 02:27:46,760
It must have been X-Defer then.

2771
02:27:46,760 --> 02:27:47,760
Why did I think it was you, Loki?

2772
02:27:47,760 --> 02:27:48,760
I get you and X-Defer confused.

2773
02:27:48,760 --> 02:27:52,720
I don't know how that's even possible.

2774
02:27:52,720 --> 02:27:54,080
Good times.

2775
02:27:54,080 --> 02:28:00,760
And he kind of reminds me of a silly character from Street Fighter IV who I hate, the big

2776
02:28:00,760 --> 02:28:05,260
giant large guy with Rufus Rufus with the balloon belly.

2777
02:28:05,260 --> 02:28:06,260
He's the American character.

2778
02:28:06,260 --> 02:28:08,320
Like this is just Capcom being silly.

2779
02:28:08,320 --> 02:28:14,040
This guy to me is that but done in a way that isn't totally stupid.

2780
02:28:14,040 --> 02:28:15,040
Rufus has fans though.

2781
02:28:15,040 --> 02:28:18,920
Rufus is going to be in the Street Fighter X Tekken game.

2782
02:28:18,920 --> 02:28:24,800
Well that makes sense, I think, but yeah, so Enzo, awesome, and this weird wacky circus

2783
02:28:24,800 --> 02:28:28,120
vaudeville guy, Dampier, if you pre-order the game.

2784
02:28:28,120 --> 02:28:32,080
And that, when is, I think I had a release date here for when that game was coming out.

2785
02:28:32,080 --> 02:28:33,080
Next year.

2786
02:28:33,080 --> 02:28:34,080
Yeah, next year.

2787
02:28:34,080 --> 02:28:35,080
January 31st.

2788
02:28:35,080 --> 02:28:36,080
Don't want to say.

2789
02:28:36,080 --> 02:28:37,080
Near the beginning of the year.

2790
02:28:37,080 --> 02:28:40,240
So Soul Calibur fans rejoice.

2791
02:28:40,240 --> 02:28:41,720
We'll be buying that, just so you know.

2792
02:28:41,720 --> 02:28:42,720
Yeah.

2793
02:28:42,720 --> 02:28:43,720
I played the hell out of IV.

2794
02:28:43,720 --> 02:28:46,520
Soul Calibur is like my favorite fighting game franchise, so that's going to be awesome.

2795
02:28:46,520 --> 02:28:47,520
I can't wait.

2796
02:28:47,520 --> 02:28:50,240
In fact, we should start playing Soul Calibur IV again in anticipation.

2797
02:28:50,240 --> 02:28:51,720
I have it on 360.

2798
02:28:51,720 --> 02:28:52,720
Good times.

2799
02:28:52,720 --> 02:28:56,000
I never did buy Vader though.

2800
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:59,680
For modded consoles, they have a topless version available.

2801
02:28:59,680 --> 02:29:00,680
Of course.

2802
02:29:00,680 --> 02:29:01,680
Of course.

2803
02:29:01,680 --> 02:29:02,680
Yeah, I have-

2804
02:29:02,680 --> 02:29:04,160
Ivy's like two pixels away from being topless.

2805
02:29:04,160 --> 02:29:07,920
I have Yoda and Vader on my 360 account, so.

2806
02:29:07,920 --> 02:29:08,920
Nice.

2807
02:29:08,920 --> 02:29:10,920
Through me, you have it.

2808
02:29:10,920 --> 02:29:11,920
Woohoo.

2809
02:29:11,920 --> 02:29:14,920
Alright, couple more stories for you guys, then we'll get to the Twitters.

2810
02:29:14,920 --> 02:29:16,280
Loki.

2811
02:29:16,280 --> 02:29:24,360
So there's a lot of high concept stuff that Microsoft's doing, especially since, you know,

2812
02:29:24,360 --> 02:29:31,040
they just, you know, had the Sesame Street Once Upon a Monster game come out on Xbox

2813
02:29:31,040 --> 02:29:37,560
360 for Kinect just last week, and so now they're kind of showing, you know, what they

2814
02:29:37,560 --> 02:29:40,480
could possibly do for, you know, new things.

2815
02:29:40,480 --> 02:29:46,560
So next year, they're talking already, there's going to be a game called Pixar's Rush, and

2816
02:29:46,560 --> 02:29:52,720
what this will allow you to do is, you know, actually go into the games as, you know, some

2817
02:29:52,720 --> 02:29:54,560
of your favorite Pixar characters.

2818
02:29:54,560 --> 02:29:58,560
They're going to have, you know, five different worlds, including The Incredibles, Ratatouille,

2819
02:29:58,560 --> 02:30:02,840
Up, Toy Story, and Cars.

2820
02:30:02,840 --> 02:30:10,360
And then, of course, going with that, they're going to also do Kinect Sesame Street TV,

2821
02:30:10,360 --> 02:30:12,920
which is kind of neat.

2822
02:30:12,920 --> 02:30:17,480
What it is, is it's going to be something that you watch actual TV shows, or like, almost

2823
02:30:17,480 --> 02:30:22,000
like episodes, and you can interact with them using Kinect.

2824
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:28,640
So like, they showed one that showed kind of an almost live-action feed of, you know,

2825
02:30:28,640 --> 02:30:29,640
Grover, whatever, trying to...

2826
02:30:29,640 --> 02:30:31,120
Can I choke Elmo?

2827
02:30:31,120 --> 02:30:33,040
I don't know about that.

2828
02:30:33,040 --> 02:30:37,160
Trying to, like, catch stuff that you throw at him and stuff.

2829
02:30:37,160 --> 02:30:43,720
And then they also had another kind of, going along with this new Family Vision video that

2830
02:30:43,720 --> 02:30:48,960
they put out, showing a Kinect National Geographic TV.

2831
02:30:48,960 --> 02:30:54,680
And with that, you can know, they have, like, people going, okay, you know, who can spot,

2832
02:30:54,680 --> 02:30:56,480
you know, whatever.

2833
02:30:56,480 --> 02:31:00,500
So you're like, you know, kind of have like a punch card almost that you're, okay, I see

2834
02:31:00,500 --> 02:31:01,500
a moose.

2835
02:31:01,500 --> 02:31:04,720
And, you know, whoever shouts it out first, you know, gets a point and that kind of stuff.

2836
02:31:04,720 --> 02:31:08,020
Or you can ask about more information on certain things.

2837
02:31:08,020 --> 02:31:09,800
It's like interactive TV almost.

2838
02:31:09,800 --> 02:31:11,280
That's kind of neat.

2839
02:31:11,280 --> 02:31:12,280
If it works.

2840
02:31:12,280 --> 02:31:14,020
See, now that's going to be something if...

2841
02:31:14,020 --> 02:31:16,320
That makes the Kinect very useful, actually.

2842
02:31:16,320 --> 02:31:22,920
That to me seems like something that would be more useful for, like, their TV service.

2843
02:31:22,920 --> 02:31:26,320
Especially since I would hope that something like that would be kind of free, since PBS

2844
02:31:26,320 --> 02:31:29,760
is free, for the most part.

2845
02:31:29,760 --> 02:31:32,720
So that'd be kind of cool if they had, you know, Sesame Street and stuff.

2846
02:31:32,720 --> 02:31:34,840
You could download episodes.

2847
02:31:34,840 --> 02:31:37,200
Why can't they do this with adult shows?

2848
02:31:37,200 --> 02:31:39,920
Like can I vote for American Idol through my Kinect?

2849
02:31:39,920 --> 02:31:42,060
That'd be kind of cool.

2850
02:31:42,060 --> 02:31:46,480
You know, or yell, fuck this guy, and it'll, like, be a negative vote or something.

2851
02:31:46,480 --> 02:31:47,480
Maybe.

2852
02:31:47,480 --> 02:31:51,920
Going to our chat room, the chat is a little bit behind because of the live delay.

2853
02:31:51,920 --> 02:31:54,200
They're commenting on the Soul Calibur story a little bit here.

2854
02:31:54,200 --> 02:31:58,640
Hitstun wanted to throw out there that Dom Pierre debuted in Soul Calibur IV PSP.

2855
02:31:58,640 --> 02:32:02,320
I guess sometimes the Soul Calibur series kind of does these previews.

2856
02:32:02,320 --> 02:32:06,360
Hitstun says, just like Amy's moveset debuted in Soul Calibur III Arcade Edition before

2857
02:32:06,360 --> 02:32:08,100
showing up in Soul Calibur IV.

2858
02:32:08,100 --> 02:32:10,680
So sometimes you get a little sneak peek.

2859
02:32:10,680 --> 02:32:13,200
I did not, I didn't play the Soul Calibur PSP.

2860
02:32:13,200 --> 02:32:14,200
I don't know, I don't know why.

2861
02:32:14,200 --> 02:32:15,480
I just didn't think it would transfer very well.

2862
02:32:15,480 --> 02:32:18,920
It's like an action RPG, I think, right, where it's fighting matches but also a story mode.

2863
02:32:18,920 --> 02:32:21,680
I think it's a lot more fighting.

2864
02:32:21,680 --> 02:32:24,200
And I believe, if I'm not mistaken, Kratos was on that.

2865
02:32:24,200 --> 02:32:27,520
So yeah, funny enough, Kratos is in everything!

2866
02:32:27,520 --> 02:32:32,160
All right, what'll he be in next, Angry Birds?

2867
02:32:32,160 --> 02:32:37,840
All right, last but not least tonight before we get to the Skype line is a story about

2868
02:32:37,840 --> 02:32:39,080
toilet gaming.

2869
02:32:39,080 --> 02:32:43,000
Yes, we've heard about this before, but no seriously, it's like going on to the next

2870
02:32:43,000 --> 02:32:44,120
level now.

2871
02:32:44,120 --> 02:32:49,400
Sega Toys is making these toilets where you can actually game with pee.

2872
02:32:49,400 --> 02:32:53,480
There's all sorts of mini games like erasing graffiti with a hose.

2873
02:32:53,480 --> 02:32:55,640
You can guess what the hose is.

2874
02:32:55,640 --> 02:32:58,540
You can use wind to blow under a woman's skirt.

2875
02:32:58,540 --> 02:33:00,000
Somehow your pee is wind.

2876
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:01,840
I don't know.

2877
02:33:01,840 --> 02:33:05,240
And do I even want to read this?

2878
02:33:05,240 --> 02:33:09,040
A bukkake battle where you shoot milk from your nose.

2879
02:33:09,040 --> 02:33:10,040
No!

2880
02:33:10,040 --> 02:33:16,480
Yes, in fact, you can actually see some pictures here at mycom.co.jp.

2881
02:33:16,480 --> 02:33:23,480
You can actually see pictures of the little urinals here with the little TV monitors in

2882
02:33:23,480 --> 02:33:24,480
them.

2883
02:33:24,480 --> 02:33:25,480
See, look at that.

2884
02:33:25,480 --> 02:33:26,480
See, that creeps me out though.

2885
02:33:26,480 --> 02:33:28,600
Doesn't that look like a little webcam at the top?

2886
02:33:28,600 --> 02:33:33,240
Like who knows what images are being transmitted to Sega headquarters on that thing?

2887
02:33:33,240 --> 02:33:35,040
Like you sick pervos.

2888
02:33:35,040 --> 02:33:39,760
And for this screenshot here with the little angry cloud of wind that's trying to blow

2889
02:33:39,760 --> 02:33:45,240
up the girl's dress so that we can see her underwear, I'm just thinking of some dude

2890
02:33:45,240 --> 02:33:49,560
totally dunking his ass over this thing and letting him want to rip and then sharding.

2891
02:33:49,560 --> 02:33:54,520
And it's like, dear Sega, your game made me shit my pants and I'm very upset that the

2892
02:33:54,520 --> 02:33:57,640
little fart cloud panty game made me do this.

2893
02:33:57,640 --> 02:33:58,640
Sorry.

2894
02:33:58,640 --> 02:33:59,640
Got problems.

2895
02:33:59,640 --> 02:34:04,720
Do you have to insert a quarter to make this work or is it just like, are we going back

2896
02:34:04,720 --> 02:34:06,480
to pay toilets or what's the deal?

2897
02:34:06,480 --> 02:34:07,840
Oh, you got to enter.

2898
02:34:07,840 --> 02:34:11,840
Insert something stop.

2899
02:34:11,840 --> 02:34:14,200
Just think of, you know, people drunk.

2900
02:34:14,200 --> 02:34:15,320
They can't aim.

2901
02:34:15,320 --> 02:34:16,360
You work in an arcade.

2902
02:34:16,360 --> 02:34:18,160
You're like, I, I'm not cleaning this up.

2903
02:34:18,160 --> 02:34:23,960
Hilarious thing to have at a bar, but let's, let's just, let's just all form a prayer circle

2904
02:34:23,960 --> 02:34:28,560
right now and hope that this never shows up in the U S let's just bow our heads.

2905
02:34:28,560 --> 02:34:33,260
All right, we're going to open up the Skype line.

2906
02:34:33,260 --> 02:34:37,600
It's about time one eight seven seven game O L R or our username on Skype is orange lounge

2907
02:34:37,600 --> 02:34:38,600
radio.

2908
02:34:38,600 --> 02:34:41,080
We will take your calls about anything you want to talk about tonight, whether it be

2909
02:34:41,080 --> 02:34:44,760
a story that we've talked about or something that maybe we didn't get to.

2910
02:34:44,760 --> 02:34:47,640
Maybe you want to talk about how you've had yourself barricaded in your room all week

2911
02:34:47,640 --> 02:34:48,640
playing Arkham city.

2912
02:34:48,640 --> 02:34:50,900
I'd love to hear about it cause sadly none of us did that.

2913
02:34:50,900 --> 02:34:53,040
So there you go.

2914
02:34:53,040 --> 02:34:57,320
One eight seven seven game O L R or our username on Skype is orange lounge radio.

2915
02:34:57,320 --> 02:35:00,960
It is a toll free number in the U S and Canada, but I can't speak for other countries.

2916
02:35:00,960 --> 02:35:04,560
I would suggest if you're in another country, you get Skype for free orange lounge radio,

2917
02:35:04,560 --> 02:35:07,160
all one word on Skype.

2918
02:35:07,160 --> 02:35:12,120
Meanwhile while we wait for calls, we're going to go to the Twitters, uh, dark to see a tweets

2919
02:35:12,120 --> 02:35:13,120
us.

2920
02:35:13,120 --> 02:35:16,400
If the DDR freak thing doesn't wind up happening, we should totally organize a tournament of

2921
02:35:16,400 --> 02:35:19,040
some sort for our 10th next year.

2922
02:35:19,040 --> 02:35:20,640
That's kind of what I want to do anyway.

2923
02:35:20,640 --> 02:35:25,560
In fact, I've, I've kind of put dark soccer in charge of putting the 10th thing together,

2924
02:35:25,560 --> 02:35:32,120
um, because she knows people that do stuff at places that we want to be involved with.

2925
02:35:32,120 --> 02:35:35,440
And I can't say much more than that, but we are trying to make the 10th a big deal, but

2926
02:35:35,440 --> 02:35:40,400
I want to warn you guys, it may not be on the exact anniversary of the show, but we're

2927
02:35:40,400 --> 02:35:42,020
trying to get close.

2928
02:35:42,020 --> 02:35:46,280
So for those that are trying to be prepared, shut up.

2929
02:35:46,280 --> 02:35:48,200
We can celebrate a little early if we want.

2930
02:35:48,200 --> 02:35:51,240
In the meantime, we're going to go to the calls and Skypline, all that stuff higher

2931
02:35:51,240 --> 02:35:52,240
on orange launch radio.

2932
02:35:52,240 --> 02:35:53,240
Who's this?

2933
02:35:53,240 --> 02:35:54,240
It's death wishings.

2934
02:35:54,240 --> 02:35:55,480
Hey, haven't heard from you in a while.

2935
02:35:55,480 --> 02:35:56,480
What's up?

2936
02:35:56,480 --> 02:35:57,480
Nothing much.

2937
02:35:57,480 --> 02:36:00,760
I'm surprised you didn't make it to Dave gruel con.

2938
02:36:00,760 --> 02:36:04,320
I'm not going to pay 130 bucks to play demos of betas.

2939
02:36:04,320 --> 02:36:06,040
I'm going to sell my soul to blizzard.

2940
02:36:06,040 --> 02:36:08,320
You can see all those cool pandas.

2941
02:36:08,320 --> 02:36:12,280
I can see all that cool shit on DirecTV and I've got this thing called the internet is

2942
02:36:12,280 --> 02:36:15,960
panda continent, panda class, panda games, and Pokemon.

2943
02:36:15,960 --> 02:36:24,680
So actually I want to talk to Loki about, uh, grant the photo mods.

2944
02:36:24,680 --> 02:36:25,680
All right.

2945
02:36:25,680 --> 02:36:26,680
That'll cost a dollar.

2946
02:36:26,680 --> 02:36:27,680
Interesting.

2947
02:36:27,680 --> 02:36:28,680
Mod is, have you heard?

2948
02:36:28,680 --> 02:36:29,680
Look, have you heard of that ice?

2949
02:36:29,680 --> 02:36:32,240
It's, I think it's like icy enhancer.

2950
02:36:32,240 --> 02:36:33,240
Yeah.

2951
02:36:33,240 --> 02:36:36,400
And it's, uh, the, uh, Ian, it's EMB stuff.

2952
02:36:36,400 --> 02:36:39,880
It like, it does like a crazy texture, like mods and all that.

2953
02:36:39,880 --> 02:36:43,000
It makes the game look just like ungodly beautiful.

2954
02:36:43,000 --> 02:36:44,000
Yeah.

2955
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:47,800
A lot of, a lot of the EMB stuff, uh, looks pretty good.

2956
02:36:47,800 --> 02:36:48,960
And I mean, do you use it?

2957
02:36:48,960 --> 02:36:49,960
Like, can you run it?

2958
02:36:49,960 --> 02:36:53,780
Cause my, my, me, my friend, we're trying to, we're worried that he wants to install it,

2959
02:36:53,780 --> 02:36:56,040
but he's afraid that he can't run it.

2960
02:36:56,040 --> 02:36:57,840
And I'm, cause he doesn't have a core i7.

2961
02:36:57,840 --> 02:37:02,000
He, I think he only has like a i3.

2962
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:08,480
I haven't tried to run it and really don't feel like trying to run it either because

2963
02:37:08,480 --> 02:37:10,680
you can break your toaster.

2964
02:37:10,680 --> 02:37:15,820
Well, because you know, on my laptop, um, you know, it runs all right.

2965
02:37:15,820 --> 02:37:21,640
I have everything turned up pretty high, but, um, I just don't really care for it to look

2966
02:37:21,640 --> 02:37:26,720
any better than it already does cause really I just use this laptop for working on map

2967
02:37:26,720 --> 02:37:28,080
mods and stuff like that.

2968
02:37:28,080 --> 02:37:34,400
And, you know, just trying to put stuff together that way.

2969
02:37:34,400 --> 02:37:38,520
You know, I, I was working on something today and the frame rate's crawling because I have

2970
02:37:38,520 --> 02:37:42,600
so many objects spawning, I have to work on, you know, trimming stuff down.

2971
02:37:42,600 --> 02:37:46,960
So yeah, I don't really need any more graphical enhancements added onto it.

2972
02:37:46,960 --> 02:37:47,960
Hmm.

2973
02:37:47,960 --> 02:37:49,480
Oh, anyways, back to Sky.

2974
02:37:49,480 --> 02:37:53,360
So what, honestly, since you played WoW, I believe you played a lot of WoW, right?

2975
02:37:53,360 --> 02:37:55,760
I have played a lot of WoW, yes.

2976
02:37:55,760 --> 02:37:58,800
What is, honestly, what is your whole opinion on this expansion?

2977
02:37:58,800 --> 02:38:02,260
Um, I, I'm whatever about the panda thing.

2978
02:38:02,260 --> 02:38:07,400
I think it's a little silly that they're bi-factional, but you know, I, I think it'll be good in

2979
02:38:07,400 --> 02:38:08,400
the long run.

2980
02:38:08,400 --> 02:38:09,600
I love the art style.

2981
02:38:09,600 --> 02:38:14,080
Like even though I'm meh on the pandas, I would have been like 100% totally okay with

2982
02:38:14,080 --> 02:38:16,720
this at the panda, panda, and been NPCs.

2983
02:38:16,720 --> 02:38:18,560
Like I kind of think they should have stayed.

2984
02:38:18,560 --> 02:38:20,960
I would have rather seen the Tuskar be playable.

2985
02:38:20,960 --> 02:38:28,440
Well, of course I just want a Tuskar named Diabetus, but the Tuskar or the Tonka, what

2986
02:38:28,440 --> 02:38:30,720
are those, what are the Torrin like people called?

2987
02:38:30,720 --> 02:38:31,720
The Bison.

2988
02:38:31,720 --> 02:38:32,720
They're Tonka.

2989
02:38:32,720 --> 02:38:33,720
Yeah.

2990
02:38:33,720 --> 02:38:34,720
They could have been a great playable class.

2991
02:38:34,720 --> 02:38:37,400
The Naga, everybody thinks is inevitable at some point.

2992
02:38:37,400 --> 02:38:39,800
It just seems like there's a lot of other stuff they could have chose from, but fine.

2993
02:38:39,800 --> 02:38:40,800
They went cute.

2994
02:38:40,800 --> 02:38:45,400
I mean, I understand, I guess pandas allegedly are a part of a lore, my friend said, but

2995
02:38:45,400 --> 02:38:50,840
they're always joke lore, but it's like, honestly, I mean, every update I've seen,

2996
02:38:50,840 --> 02:38:52,640
you know, and wow, like that, it's so funny.

2997
02:38:52,640 --> 02:38:56,840
The ones that have added like big segments were, this is part of the segment and then

2998
02:38:56,840 --> 02:38:57,840
there's all this shit to do.

2999
02:38:57,840 --> 02:39:01,520
And then it was like cataclysm, oh, it changes map, but there's all this shit to do.

3000
02:39:01,520 --> 02:39:05,640
And then this one's just like fucking pandas everywhere.

3001
02:39:05,640 --> 02:39:06,640
Look at us.

3002
02:39:06,640 --> 02:39:07,640
We're so cool.

3003
02:39:07,640 --> 02:39:08,640
Weaboo now.

3004
02:39:08,640 --> 02:39:10,200
Well, look, here's the thing though.

3005
02:39:10,200 --> 02:39:13,520
At the end of the day, like I probably will not be rolling a panda monk.

3006
02:39:13,520 --> 02:39:16,640
I will have to roll a gnome monk, cause that's going to be awesome.

3007
02:39:16,640 --> 02:39:17,640
Cause gnomes are hilarious.

3008
02:39:17,640 --> 02:39:18,640
Oh, you can be a gnome monk?

3009
02:39:18,640 --> 02:39:20,080
I thought it was only pandas could be monks.

3010
02:39:20,080 --> 02:39:24,600
No, anybody can be not monks, except funny enough, Worgen and Goblin, who were the additions

3011
02:39:24,600 --> 02:39:26,320
in the last expansion.

3012
02:39:26,320 --> 02:39:29,920
Every other race in the game can be, I'm just waiting to see a bunch of pandas with a variation

3013
02:39:29,920 --> 02:39:31,040
of the name, Jack Black.

3014
02:39:31,040 --> 02:39:32,040
Yeah, I know.

3015
02:39:32,040 --> 02:39:33,040
Right.

3016
02:39:33,040 --> 02:39:34,040
Reserve the names.

3017
02:39:34,040 --> 02:39:37,960
Now, Slace's Pop told a funny joke on Horde House about, what was it you said about female

3018
02:39:37,960 --> 02:39:38,960
pandarins?

3019
02:39:38,960 --> 02:39:44,080
Their slash dance emote is they're just going to sit in a chair and move their hand around

3020
02:39:44,080 --> 02:39:46,640
like Adele and rolling in the deep.

3021
02:39:46,640 --> 02:39:47,720
They're just going to sit in a chair.

3022
02:39:47,720 --> 02:39:51,640
I was trying to get, I was trying to get a panda named Adele, but the name was already

3023
02:39:51,640 --> 02:39:52,640
taken.

3024
02:39:52,640 --> 02:39:53,640
Like somebody beat us to it.

3025
02:39:53,640 --> 02:39:56,520
So, uh, but, uh, here's the thing, Death Wishing.

3026
02:39:56,520 --> 02:40:00,000
And I kind of said this at the top of the show, but I'm more excited about the fact

3027
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:05,040
that they're giving players at level 90, so much more to do than just dungeon rating and

3028
02:40:05,040 --> 02:40:07,440
PVP, which is already a lot as it is, but now,

3029
02:40:07,440 --> 02:40:09,040
They're giving us Pokemon.

3030
02:40:09,040 --> 02:40:10,040
Pokemon.

3031
02:40:10,040 --> 02:40:11,040
Believe it or not.

3032
02:40:11,040 --> 02:40:12,040
It's a thing.

3033
02:40:12,040 --> 02:40:13,040
People will be into it.

3034
02:40:13,040 --> 02:40:14,040
Uh, challenge dungeons.

3035
02:40:14,040 --> 02:40:15,040
Sounds like I'm really excited.

3036
02:40:15,040 --> 02:40:18,640
I think they're just scared because of the older public.

3037
02:40:18,640 --> 02:40:19,640
Of course they are.

3038
02:40:19,640 --> 02:40:20,640
Of course they are.

3039
02:40:20,640 --> 02:40:21,640
They're just business.

3040
02:40:21,640 --> 02:40:23,640
I stopped playing Eve Online just because of that.

3041
02:40:23,640 --> 02:40:25,200
I'm going to be playing that.

3042
02:40:25,200 --> 02:40:29,000
Here's the thing, you know, and I have no doubt that the game will be good.

3043
02:40:29,000 --> 02:40:31,120
However, we have gone through this.

3044
02:40:31,120 --> 02:40:32,480
How many times?

3045
02:40:32,480 --> 02:40:34,560
Age of Conan was going to be the killer.

3046
02:40:34,560 --> 02:40:36,640
Then EverQuest II and then War Hammer.

3047
02:40:36,640 --> 02:40:39,240
You don't understand man, it's Star Wars.

3048
02:40:39,240 --> 02:40:40,240
I know.

3049
02:40:40,240 --> 02:40:41,240
I know.

3050
02:40:41,240 --> 02:40:44,160
It's going to be all the people, I'm telling you, all the people from Star Wars Galaxies

3051
02:40:44,160 --> 02:40:48,440
will play it because of the remorse of Star Wars Galaxies shutting down.

3052
02:40:48,440 --> 02:40:51,600
They may not like it, but they'll just cry themselves while playing it.

3053
02:40:51,600 --> 02:40:55,120
I miss you.

3054
02:40:55,120 --> 02:40:56,120
That's all I can say.

3055
02:40:56,120 --> 02:41:00,200
I, I, I, obviously Blizzard is going to lose some people to Star Wars.

3056
02:41:00,200 --> 02:41:03,440
That's why they've come up with this whole annual pass thing to lock you in anyway.

3057
02:41:03,440 --> 02:41:05,000
I mean that's no, no.

3058
02:41:05,000 --> 02:41:09,440
I mean, I heard that buying a year pass now you can get Diablo 3 for free, that's from

3059
02:41:09,440 --> 02:41:11,480
what I heard.

3060
02:41:11,480 --> 02:41:16,560
And that's just kind of solidifying that they, Activision Blizzard has too much money.

3061
02:41:16,560 --> 02:41:18,880
Well we'll give you the game that we know we're going to make shitloads of money on

3062
02:41:18,880 --> 02:41:19,880
for free.

3063
02:41:19,880 --> 02:41:20,880
Not really.

3064
02:41:20,880 --> 02:41:21,880
Because we have too much money.

3065
02:41:21,880 --> 02:41:25,200
I know, they're going to make money on Diablo anyway, and like I said earlier, if you're

3066
02:41:25,200 --> 02:41:29,800
contracted for a year of wow, you pretty much are guaranteed to get Mists of Pandaria, which

3067
02:41:29,800 --> 02:41:32,800
they're not giving you for free, so.

3068
02:41:32,800 --> 02:41:33,800
Mists of Pandaria.

3069
02:41:33,800 --> 02:41:34,800
Yep.

3070
02:41:34,800 --> 02:41:40,760
Alright, any other BlizzCon or what have you thoughts before we let you go, buddy?

3071
02:41:40,760 --> 02:41:43,360
Did anything cool happen with the whole Foo Fighters thing?

3072
02:41:43,360 --> 02:41:45,040
Any reports on that, or was it just Foo Fighters?

3073
02:41:45,040 --> 02:41:47,720
Dave Roll played the guitar in the audience, that's what I heard.

3074
02:41:47,720 --> 02:41:49,120
So like, you might have got to touch him.

3075
02:41:49,120 --> 02:41:50,760
Oh okay, so I already seen that live.

3076
02:41:50,760 --> 02:41:51,760
Oh okay, cool.

3077
02:41:51,760 --> 02:41:52,760
Alright, cool story bro.

3078
02:41:52,760 --> 02:41:53,760
Alright.

3079
02:41:53,760 --> 02:41:54,760
Alright.

3080
02:41:54,760 --> 02:41:55,760
Take care, buddy.

3081
02:41:55,760 --> 02:41:56,760
Later.

3082
02:41:56,760 --> 02:41:57,760
Bye.

3083
02:41:57,760 --> 02:42:03,400
I still want the WoW expansion, Mists of Panera Bread, so I can play a, get a turkey feta

3084
02:42:03,400 --> 02:42:05,360
panini with side salad.

3085
02:42:05,360 --> 02:42:07,920
Kaijuto in chat says, back off Adele, she's hot.

3086
02:42:07,920 --> 02:42:12,160
Hey, I never said she wasn't hot, like you know, everybody's into whatever, but I'm just,

3087
02:42:12,160 --> 02:42:16,480
I'm sorry, it's just, the joke was too good, you had to, I had to be there.

3088
02:42:16,480 --> 02:42:19,000
Alright, let's see, moving on with some more tweets.

3089
02:42:19,000 --> 02:42:22,600
MNZeba tweets us saying, Loki, is this what you do when you play Grand Theft Auto?

3090
02:42:22,600 --> 02:42:26,240
Usually I don't click on YouTubes that I don't know what they are, but I'm going to take

3091
02:42:26,240 --> 02:42:27,240
a chance on this one.

3092
02:42:27,240 --> 02:42:28,240
Let's see.

3093
02:42:28,240 --> 02:42:31,240
No, but I feel like that's pretty funny.

3094
02:42:31,240 --> 02:42:33,960
It's like, what, throwing cars at people?

3095
02:42:33,960 --> 02:42:39,800
No, it's not throwing cars, the cars just never exist, so they fly around.

3096
02:42:39,800 --> 02:42:40,800
That's funny.

3097
02:42:40,800 --> 02:42:44,040
It looks like Nightmeto's just throwing cars around.

3098
02:42:44,040 --> 02:42:51,080
It is very hard to play that, I once contemplated doing that as part of the mod, but I was quickly

3099
02:42:51,080 --> 02:42:53,800
vetoed on that, because, so like, uh, yeah.

3100
02:42:53,800 --> 02:42:57,920
So you're trying to do the campaign stuff, or is this for Deathmatch, or are you trying

3101
02:42:57,920 --> 02:42:58,920
to run around?

3102
02:42:58,920 --> 02:43:01,400
I gotta take this call, it's a very appropriate time.

3103
02:43:01,400 --> 02:43:03,400
Hi, you're on Warner Brothers Radio, who's this?

3104
02:43:03,400 --> 02:43:04,400
Hi, this is Zeba.

3105
02:43:04,400 --> 02:43:08,640
Zeba, we're watching this video, I am cracking the hell up at this Grand Theft Auto stuff,

3106
02:43:08,640 --> 02:43:09,640
this is great.

3107
02:43:09,640 --> 02:43:14,200
Yeah, I found that on my Twitter, I was like, oh god, I just thought of Loki just right

3108
02:43:14,200 --> 02:43:15,200
when I watched it.

3109
02:43:15,200 --> 02:43:18,840
And I love that they used the Benny Hill theme, A+, thumbs up.

3110
02:43:18,840 --> 02:43:19,840
Thanks.

3111
02:43:19,840 --> 02:43:22,120
So what's on your mind tonight, Zeba?

3112
02:43:22,120 --> 02:43:24,360
I just want to let you know, you jinxed my iPhone.

3113
02:43:24,360 --> 02:43:27,680
Oh shit, what did I do?

3114
02:43:27,680 --> 02:43:33,640
A couple days later, that you announced that your iPhone's power button went, um, mine

3115
02:43:33,640 --> 02:43:34,640
went.

3116
02:43:34,640 --> 02:43:38,120
Oh no, I'm sorry, is it the sleep button, or is it the...

3117
02:43:38,120 --> 02:43:41,880
Yes, the sleep button, the sleep power button, whatever you want to call it, on the top.

3118
02:43:41,880 --> 02:43:48,400
They're faulty, I want a refund, I'm suing Apple, I'm suing Steve Jobs, wait, can't do

3119
02:43:48,400 --> 02:43:52,200
that, I'm suing Tim Cook, I'm suing everybody.

3120
02:43:52,200 --> 02:43:59,040
Well, thank god that my iPhone is not a year old yet, so I still had warranty, so they

3121
02:43:59,040 --> 02:44:01,120
were able to give me a whole new phone.

3122
02:44:01,120 --> 02:44:02,120
Nice!

3123
02:44:02,120 --> 02:44:03,120
You know what's funny?

3124
02:44:03,120 --> 02:44:07,120
My very first iPhone 4, the little ringer button, the little thing on the side next

3125
02:44:07,120 --> 02:44:11,520
to the volume that turns the ringer on and off, that was broken.

3126
02:44:11,520 --> 02:44:15,840
But that was like day one, a break, so they gave me a new phone for free, but it was still,

3127
02:44:15,840 --> 02:44:18,280
I had to re-sync everything, blah blah blah blah.

3128
02:44:18,280 --> 02:44:21,940
I'm gonna get a new phone, but probably in January, and I've got to decide between now

3129
02:44:21,940 --> 02:44:26,320
and then if I'm just gonna say, you know what, forget the iPhone, I'm done with it, and go

3130
02:44:26,320 --> 02:44:31,600
to the iPad, or if I'm gonna get suckered in and buy the iPhone 4S anyway, of which

3131
02:44:31,600 --> 02:44:36,440
everybody's just raving about Siri, oh, I love Siri, I love Siri, so.

3132
02:44:36,440 --> 02:44:40,360
How are you liking your iPhone, though, otherwise, do you do any gaming on it?

3133
02:44:40,360 --> 02:44:49,440
I have some games, I have like Secret of Mana, and Final Fantasy Tactics, and Katamari Damacy,

3134
02:44:49,440 --> 02:44:51,480
and you know, Infinity Blade.

3135
02:44:51,480 --> 02:44:54,360
Do you think, is it just me, or do a lot of them play like poop?

3136
02:44:54,360 --> 02:44:58,760
Yeah, especially Secret of Mana is really hard to move around.

3137
02:44:58,760 --> 02:44:59,760
Yeah, it's unfortunate.

3138
02:44:59,760 --> 02:45:03,600
They made it a little better, but it still is pretty hard.

3139
02:45:03,600 --> 02:45:09,920
I will say, though, the Final Fantasy 3 remake, it's probably still like 15 bucks, which is

3140
02:45:09,920 --> 02:45:16,080
like 15 times as much, what most games cost, but it's actually done really well, and it's

3141
02:45:16,080 --> 02:45:21,940
easy to control, so I gotta say, the Final Fantasy 3 remake from the DS is really good

3142
02:45:21,940 --> 02:45:28,320
on iPhone, or iPad, whatever it is, you're gonna game on out there in the audience, so.

3143
02:45:28,320 --> 02:45:32,960
I did have the DS version, so I'm not really into, you know, getting it on my phone.

3144
02:45:32,960 --> 02:45:35,160
Yeah, you don't need to buy the same thing twice, that's true.

3145
02:45:35,160 --> 02:45:36,160
No.

3146
02:45:36,160 --> 02:45:38,920
So what else have you been playing, any console or PC games?

3147
02:45:38,920 --> 02:45:45,880
I did get a new DS game, I can't really pronounce the name, it's like Sola do Robo, the Red

3148
02:45:45,880 --> 02:45:46,880
Hunter.

3149
02:45:46,880 --> 02:45:47,880
Okay.

3150
02:45:47,880 --> 02:45:50,000
What's this game about?

3151
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:54,360
All the furries are getting it, but that's not why I got it.

3152
02:45:54,360 --> 02:45:59,200
But it's, I just kind of just started playing it, so I really don't know too much about

3153
02:45:59,200 --> 02:46:06,120
the story, but you are this fox, and you're just trying to save the world, but I really

3154
02:46:06,120 --> 02:46:10,160
don't know too much about the story, like I said, I have to keep going at it, but I

3155
02:46:10,160 --> 02:46:11,160
like it so far.

3156
02:46:11,160 --> 02:46:12,160
Nice.

3157
02:46:12,160 --> 02:46:15,200
And why are the furries into it?

3158
02:46:15,200 --> 02:46:21,440
Because it's all, you know, anthropomorphic characters in it.

3159
02:46:21,440 --> 02:46:22,440
That sounds like fun.

3160
02:46:22,440 --> 02:46:26,320
Slice just popped, did I see your eyes just perk up a little bit?

3161
02:46:26,320 --> 02:46:27,320
Yes.

3162
02:46:27,320 --> 02:46:30,600
Oh god, please don't go there.

3163
02:46:30,600 --> 02:46:31,600
Alright.

3164
02:46:31,600 --> 02:46:36,220
Ziba, I hope you enjoy the game, and enjoy your phone now that it works again, and I'm

3165
02:46:36,220 --> 02:46:37,920
sorry to curse you, but I'm really happy.

3166
02:46:37,920 --> 02:46:39,240
I'm really just joking.

3167
02:46:39,240 --> 02:46:43,080
I know, I know, but I'm glad you at least got a replacement for free.

3168
02:46:43,080 --> 02:46:45,960
To be fair, I still need to take mine to the store and see if there's anything they can

3169
02:46:45,960 --> 02:46:49,360
do with it, but I just, I don't have my hopes up because I didn't buy AppleCare, so.

3170
02:46:49,360 --> 02:46:52,840
Alright, well Ziba, I'm going to let you go, okay?

3171
02:46:52,840 --> 02:46:53,840
Okay, thank you.

3172
02:46:53,840 --> 02:46:55,800
Alright, take care, thanks for calling in, and thanks again for the video.

3173
02:46:55,800 --> 02:46:56,800
No problem.

3174
02:46:56,800 --> 02:46:57,800
Later.

3175
02:46:57,800 --> 02:47:01,400
1877 Game OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

3176
02:47:01,400 --> 02:47:05,640
Going to some other tweets, Zither77 tweets us saying, you guys may want to see this,

3177
02:47:05,640 --> 02:47:09,880
it's probably going to be the pinball video game to end all pinball video games, and gives

3178
02:47:09,880 --> 02:47:16,440
this cheap plug for pinball arcade, which I guess is for the phones and so forth.

3179
02:47:16,440 --> 02:47:19,120
Is this like something you're working on or something?

3180
02:47:19,120 --> 02:47:20,120
I don't know.

3181
02:47:20,120 --> 02:47:24,920
Oh shit, it has Arabian Nights, I'm there.

3182
02:47:24,920 --> 02:47:26,920
Fucking love the Arabian Nights table.

3183
02:47:26,920 --> 02:47:28,760
Isn't this just...

3184
02:47:28,760 --> 02:47:35,800
Oh, it looks like they have an arrangement with various pinball table folks.

3185
02:47:35,800 --> 02:47:39,040
There's Black Hole, because it's got Ballystern.

3186
02:47:39,040 --> 02:47:44,440
Oh my god, Theater of Magic, I'm so in, this is like the best table ever.

3187
02:47:44,440 --> 02:47:47,440
You remember this, did you ever play that?

3188
02:47:47,440 --> 02:47:48,440
Yeah.

3189
02:47:48,440 --> 02:47:54,600
Alright, I don't know if you work for the developer or what, but good job, I'm sold.

3190
02:47:54,600 --> 02:47:59,440
Let's see, Ericcarr18 on Twitter tweets us saying, hey guys, what if someone made a Red

3191
02:47:59,440 --> 02:48:01,960
Dead Redemption-esque game for the Kinect?

3192
02:48:01,960 --> 02:48:04,420
I think that might be cool.

3193
02:48:04,420 --> 02:48:06,200
Would you play Red Dead Redemption on Kinect?

3194
02:48:06,200 --> 02:48:07,200
No.

3195
02:48:07,200 --> 02:48:10,960
I think Red Dead Redemption on Kinect would not be as good as just Red Dead Redemption.

3196
02:48:10,960 --> 02:48:16,200
Like, I don't know, I don't think people should feel forced to pigeonhole an existing game

3197
02:48:16,200 --> 02:48:17,200
into the Kinect.

3198
02:48:17,200 --> 02:48:19,280
Like, that Fable game really has me worried.

3199
02:48:19,280 --> 02:48:23,320
What are you talking about, it has you worried?

3200
02:48:23,320 --> 02:48:26,480
It's gonna suck, like all the other ones have sucked.

3201
02:48:26,480 --> 02:48:27,600
I know.

3202
02:48:27,600 --> 02:48:30,520
Because Peter Molyneux is full of crap.

3203
02:48:30,520 --> 02:48:31,960
But he's new and cutting edge.

3204
02:48:31,960 --> 02:48:34,160
No, he's not new and cutting edge, he's stupid.

3205
02:48:34,160 --> 02:48:35,160
Hey, ah!

3206
02:48:35,160 --> 02:48:36,160
What's up in here?

3207
02:48:36,160 --> 02:48:37,160
Hey, Zaku.

3208
02:48:37,160 --> 02:48:38,160
Welcome to the show.

3209
02:48:38,160 --> 02:48:39,160
What's on your mind, buddy?

3210
02:48:39,160 --> 02:48:44,760
Oh, nothing much, just trying to like absorb all the gaming news that's, you know, or lack

3211
02:48:44,760 --> 02:48:45,760
thereof maybe.

3212
02:48:45,760 --> 02:48:47,560
It was just happening this weekend.

3213
02:48:47,560 --> 02:48:50,040
Well, if you're not into Blizzard, it has been kind of a dry week.

3214
02:48:50,040 --> 02:48:57,400
You know, Blizzcon happened, and you know, aside from like, Starcraft, the new expansion

3215
02:48:57,400 --> 02:49:03,680
pack, not really like phased in, but I am hyped for Battlefield 3, which is like this

3216
02:49:03,680 --> 02:49:06,400
Tuesday, even though I don't have my new computer ready.

3217
02:49:06,400 --> 02:49:08,440
Oh, I didn't realize it was that soon.

3218
02:49:08,440 --> 02:49:09,440
It's this Tuesday, huh?

3219
02:49:09,440 --> 02:49:10,440
Yeah.

3220
02:49:10,440 --> 02:49:11,440
Now, you've been talking, you've talked.

3221
02:49:11,440 --> 02:49:14,520
I just, like, because of work and everything, I didn't have the time to like start speccing

3222
02:49:14,520 --> 02:49:17,800
on a new computer, so I'm gonna have to play catch up.

3223
02:49:17,800 --> 02:49:21,840
You've called in to talk about this game before, are you excited about this?

3224
02:49:21,840 --> 02:49:22,840
Are you buying it?

3225
02:49:22,840 --> 02:49:28,200
Yes, I mean, I've seen footage of the beta so far, and it's like, it's a lot better than,

3226
02:49:28,200 --> 02:49:31,520
it's pretty much a lot better than Bad Company 2 at the very least.

3227
02:49:31,520 --> 02:49:38,440
More importantly, it does step it up as being the most realistic first person shooter this

3228
02:49:38,440 --> 02:49:39,440
year.

3229
02:49:39,440 --> 02:49:41,560
Did you decide to go PC, Xbox?

3230
02:49:41,560 --> 02:49:42,560
PC.

3231
02:49:42,560 --> 02:49:43,560
Okay.

3232
02:49:43,560 --> 02:49:47,000
Why do you think I just said that I'm trying to specc out a new PC for you?

3233
02:49:47,000 --> 02:49:48,000
Oh, derp.

3234
02:49:48,000 --> 02:49:49,000
Okay.

3235
02:49:49,000 --> 02:49:50,000
So I don't listen very well, my bad.

3236
02:49:50,000 --> 02:49:55,920
But it's just like, I mean, I've already made my decision between that and Modern Warfare

3237
02:49:55,920 --> 02:49:56,920
3.

3238
02:49:56,920 --> 02:50:01,280
I mean, at this point, it's like, even with Modern Warfare 3, even the fact they have

3239
02:50:01,280 --> 02:50:04,000
dedicated servers, they're only for unranked.

3240
02:50:04,000 --> 02:50:08,300
So it's like, if I wanted to level up in that game, I would have to put up with the peer

3241
02:50:08,300 --> 02:50:11,000
to peer crap, which is like not good on the PC.

3242
02:50:11,000 --> 02:50:12,000
It's a horrible experience.

3243
02:50:12,000 --> 02:50:13,760
It's only meant for consoles.

3244
02:50:13,760 --> 02:50:19,840
I think the way I see it is like Activision giving us like half, it's like going halfway

3245
02:50:19,840 --> 02:50:24,840
instead of actually like, you know, doing what they did before, like with the first

3246
02:50:24,840 --> 02:50:25,920
Modern Warfare.

3247
02:50:25,920 --> 02:50:31,960
What about if you can set up these controlled, super easy environments where somebody could

3248
02:50:31,960 --> 02:50:35,920
just have a server that's for nothing but ranking up quickly and it would kind of ruin

3249
02:50:35,920 --> 02:50:36,920
things?

3250
02:50:36,920 --> 02:50:37,920
Like I can kind of see that side of it.

3251
02:50:37,920 --> 02:50:38,920
Well, that's the thing.

3252
02:50:38,920 --> 02:50:49,040
I mean, I played Modern Warfare on PC with the servers and I was able to rank up easily.

3253
02:50:49,040 --> 02:50:53,640
Then again, I have like skill with the keyboard and mouse, but the point is that it didn't

3254
02:50:53,640 --> 02:50:56,040
really impact cheating as much.

3255
02:50:56,040 --> 02:51:02,160
Because either way, once they spotted you as a cheater, you automatically get kicked

3256
02:51:02,160 --> 02:51:04,000
and banned from that server.

3257
02:51:04,000 --> 02:51:06,600
You know, Punkbuster works pretty well.

3258
02:51:06,600 --> 02:51:07,600
It's a pretty good hammer.

3259
02:51:07,600 --> 02:51:10,880
Yeah, but it's leveling up quickly cheating?

3260
02:51:10,880 --> 02:51:16,080
Well, cheating in the sense of like when they find people hacking or cheating in that particular

3261
02:51:16,080 --> 02:51:19,880
server, you know, the admins boot them really fast.

3262
02:51:19,880 --> 02:51:27,680
But I could see why Activision is trying to like release their half-baked solution for

3263
02:51:27,680 --> 02:51:32,720
the lack of any servers in Modern Warfare 2.

3264
02:51:32,720 --> 02:51:37,340
They still want to push Elite, that whole Elite thing.

3265
02:51:37,340 --> 02:51:44,400
And the fact that I guess having a dedicated server ranked, they believe that they will

3266
02:51:44,400 --> 02:51:47,040
probably game the system that way.

3267
02:51:47,040 --> 02:51:51,480
You know, you have folks that find exploits that aren't really patched or more importantly

3268
02:51:51,480 --> 02:51:55,760
you set up a server just for like the sake of ranking really fast.

3269
02:51:55,760 --> 02:52:00,680
I know Team Fortress 2 had this issue back in the day where it's just like people just

3270
02:52:00,680 --> 02:52:05,760
idling in order to get like unlocks.

3271
02:52:05,760 --> 02:52:07,640
But yeah, I could see why they did that.

3272
02:52:07,640 --> 02:52:13,180
I mean, Battlefield 3 has dedicated servers, but it's like, I know they're, it's almost

3273
02:52:13,180 --> 02:52:19,280
like Bad Company 2 where everything's going to be like from their third-party providers.

3274
02:52:19,280 --> 02:52:21,520
But it's still a good solution though.

3275
02:52:21,520 --> 02:52:28,320
Well, I mean, at the end of the day, you're going to buy both games no matter what, right?

3276
02:52:28,320 --> 02:52:30,380
I'm probably going to just stick with Battlefield 3.

3277
02:52:30,380 --> 02:52:31,880
I've already made my decision.

3278
02:52:31,880 --> 02:52:36,240
I'm not going to touch Modern Warfare 3 unless I can pick it up for dirt cheap.

3279
02:52:36,240 --> 02:52:40,240
Otherwise I'm just going to stick with Battlefield 3.

3280
02:52:40,240 --> 02:52:44,240
I know it's not on Steam and I'm going to, you know, I'm going to have to bite the bullet

3281
02:52:44,240 --> 02:52:45,720
and give Origin a shot.

3282
02:52:45,720 --> 02:52:49,240
Well, props to you sticking by your guns and voting with your dollars.

3283
02:52:49,240 --> 02:52:50,240
You know, that's what we always say.

3284
02:52:50,240 --> 02:52:51,240
Exactly.

3285
02:52:51,240 --> 02:52:52,240
If you feel strongly enough, vote with your dollars.

3286
02:52:52,240 --> 02:52:53,240
All right, Zach.

3287
02:52:53,240 --> 02:52:56,680
We're going to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but have fun and hopefully see you

3288
02:52:56,680 --> 02:52:57,680
in next week's show.

3289
02:52:57,680 --> 02:52:58,680
You're not too busy playing Battlefield.

3290
02:52:58,680 --> 02:52:59,680
Well, that's the thing.

3291
02:52:59,680 --> 02:53:04,320
If I can get a computer in like a week, which I doubt, it's going to take a few more weeks

3292
02:53:04,320 --> 02:53:05,920
for me to spec out everything.

3293
02:53:05,920 --> 02:53:09,600
All right, then we know when you disappear what happened.

3294
02:53:09,600 --> 02:53:10,600
Exactly.

3295
02:53:10,600 --> 02:53:11,600
All right.

3296
02:53:11,600 --> 02:53:12,600
Take care, buddy.

3297
02:53:12,600 --> 02:53:13,600
All right.

3298
02:53:13,600 --> 02:53:14,600
Bye.

3299
02:53:14,600 --> 02:53:15,600
All right.

3300
02:53:15,600 --> 02:53:16,600
That's going to do it for Skype calls tonight.

3301
02:53:16,600 --> 02:53:20,240
For those who didn't get through, sorry, but try writing us an email, Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

3302
02:53:20,240 --> 02:53:23,600
I want to quickly wrap up the rest of these tweets, though, real quick.

3303
02:53:23,600 --> 02:53:26,360
Osfer tweets us saying a couple things.

3304
02:53:26,360 --> 02:53:29,000
First, I'm watching people play the new Spyro.

3305
02:53:29,000 --> 02:53:31,760
It doesn't look nearly as bad as Loki describes.

3306
02:53:31,760 --> 02:53:35,260
Loki, it's just you're too harsh on him.

3307
02:53:35,260 --> 02:53:41,400
It's all about, not necessarily the gameplay, but the message behind it.

3308
02:53:41,400 --> 02:53:43,160
It sets precedent.

3309
02:53:43,160 --> 02:53:46,880
And Osfer also asks, random question for the staff.

3310
02:53:46,880 --> 02:53:48,560
Who is your favorite Pokemon?

3311
02:53:48,560 --> 02:53:50,720
Mine is Mewtwo.

3312
02:53:50,720 --> 02:53:51,720
I have an answer for this.

3313
02:53:51,720 --> 02:53:54,320
Does anyone else on staff have a way to answer for this?

3314
02:53:54,320 --> 02:53:55,320
SalaciousPop?

3315
02:53:55,320 --> 02:53:57,440
You watch or play Pokemon?

3316
02:53:57,440 --> 02:53:58,440
Bidoof.

3317
02:53:58,440 --> 02:53:59,440
What's Bidoof?

3318
02:53:59,440 --> 02:54:02,120
I've never heard of Bidoof, or did you make that up?

3319
02:54:02,120 --> 02:54:07,520
No, I need to Google it, but he's the little squirrel that's stupid, and he's like the

3320
02:54:07,520 --> 02:54:09,560
worst Pokemon ever.

3321
02:54:09,560 --> 02:54:13,640
My favorite Pokemon by far is Jigglypuff, the one that gets really pissed off when she

3322
02:54:13,640 --> 02:54:17,160
sings and puts everyone to sleep, that she draws on their face with a marker.

3323
02:54:17,160 --> 02:54:19,120
Those are always my favorite episodes of the old show.

3324
02:54:19,120 --> 02:54:20,760
Loki, do you have a favorite Pokemon?

3325
02:54:20,760 --> 02:54:25,280
I don't know any of the Pokemon.

3326
02:54:25,280 --> 02:54:27,400
One of these days, I want to convince Loki to a bet.

3327
02:54:27,400 --> 02:54:29,940
I mean, obviously, we're never going to get him to dress up as the Tingle outfit, but

3328
02:54:29,940 --> 02:54:32,000
we have to think of other things that would be awesome.

3329
02:54:32,000 --> 02:54:36,600
And I think one of them would be that Loki would have to sing the Pokemon rap on air.

3330
02:54:36,600 --> 02:54:41,040
Aww, that's a cute little derpy mon.

3331
02:54:41,040 --> 02:54:42,040
I like that.

3332
02:54:42,040 --> 02:54:43,040
Is that the one you...

3333
02:54:43,040 --> 02:54:44,040
That's Bidoof.

3334
02:54:44,040 --> 02:54:45,600
Bidoof?

3335
02:54:45,600 --> 02:54:47,400
On YouTube, everyone should Google.

3336
02:54:47,400 --> 02:54:51,860
It was UPN's Cartoon Afternoons.

3337
02:54:51,860 --> 02:54:56,760
It was one of the bumpers they made between Batman, the animated series, and Pokemon.

3338
02:54:56,760 --> 02:55:00,400
And it's Batman Sings Jigglypuff, and if you find it, you should just pull it up right

3339
02:55:00,400 --> 02:55:01,400
now.

3340
02:55:01,400 --> 02:55:02,400
It's super awesome.

3341
02:55:02,400 --> 02:55:05,080
It's a bumper that UPN made.

3342
02:55:05,080 --> 02:55:07,760
Could it be this right here?

3343
02:55:07,760 --> 02:55:10,680
Jigglypuff, a balloon Pokemon.

3344
02:55:10,680 --> 02:55:12,120
Time for bed.

3345
02:55:12,120 --> 02:55:14,440
All right, but a deal's a deal.

3346
02:55:14,440 --> 02:55:15,440
No way.

3347
02:55:15,440 --> 02:55:16,440
You promised.

3348
02:55:16,440 --> 02:55:17,440
Jigglypuff, Jigglypuff.

3349
02:55:17,440 --> 02:55:18,920
All right, good night.

3350
02:55:18,920 --> 02:55:20,920
The whole thing.

3351
02:55:20,920 --> 02:55:32,000
Jigglypuff, Jigglypuff, Jigglypuff.

3352
02:55:32,000 --> 02:55:36,200
Pokemon, next on Kids WB.

3353
02:55:36,200 --> 02:55:39,280
WB, not UPN, my bad.

3354
02:55:39,280 --> 02:55:42,200
Ah, same thing now, it doesn't matter.

3355
02:55:42,200 --> 02:55:43,200
Good times.

3356
02:55:43,200 --> 02:55:45,200
I love Jigglypuff.

3357
02:55:45,200 --> 02:55:48,520
Some tweets from Tigerclaw305, since it's a couple tweets.

3358
02:55:48,520 --> 02:55:51,360
I thought you hit on this one earlier in the show, Loki.

3359
02:55:51,360 --> 02:55:55,160
Was it the Portal 2 DLC that will have an in-game map editor with it?

3360
02:55:55,160 --> 02:55:56,160
Yeah.

3361
02:55:56,160 --> 02:55:57,280
I thought you'd mention something about that.

3362
02:55:57,280 --> 02:56:00,880
Well, it does come with an in-game map editor as well, if you didn't already know.

3363
02:56:00,880 --> 02:56:03,200
And that's cool.

3364
02:56:03,200 --> 02:56:07,320
Because some of the best levels are gonna come from the users that make their own crazy

3365
02:56:07,320 --> 02:56:08,320
shit.

3366
02:56:08,320 --> 02:56:11,840
So I'm always happy to see level editors come to games.

3367
02:56:11,840 --> 02:56:16,240
It seems like it's a little late, but I guess if it extends the life of the game, then yay,

3368
02:56:16,240 --> 02:56:17,240
right?

3369
02:56:17,240 --> 02:56:18,240
Yeah.

3370
02:56:18,240 --> 02:56:24,640
This is another tweet about Mass Effect 3's demo will be out early for Battlefield 3 buyers

3371
02:56:24,640 --> 02:56:27,280
if you get it new.

3372
02:56:27,280 --> 02:56:30,920
Yet another spin on the Project $10, but at least this one isn't as bad.

3373
02:56:30,920 --> 02:56:35,480
I mean, an early demo, that's more of a reasonable kind of perk, right?

3374
02:56:35,480 --> 02:56:40,460
So there's gonna be a demo for Mass Effect 3 in January, and it was announced by BioWare.

3375
02:56:40,460 --> 02:56:42,920
More information will be on BioWare's forums.

3376
02:56:42,920 --> 02:56:48,680
But if you redeem the online pass for Battlefield 3, it will be available earlier to you.

3377
02:56:48,680 --> 02:56:51,320
Mass Effect 3, by the way, is supposed to have multiplayer support.

3378
02:56:51,320 --> 02:56:53,280
That was confirmed earlier this month.

3379
02:56:53,280 --> 02:56:57,000
And it's gonna have an online co-op mode that can affect the single-player game.

3380
02:56:57,000 --> 02:56:58,000
Interesting.

3381
02:56:58,000 --> 02:57:03,560
So yep, if you activate a Battlefield 3 online pass on any of the platforms, I guess the

3382
02:57:03,560 --> 02:57:09,080
EA account, your account will just be enabled with this access to get the demo.

3383
02:57:09,080 --> 02:57:12,840
So that's kinda cool on whatever system the code was redeemed on.

3384
02:57:12,840 --> 02:57:13,840
So...

3385
02:57:13,840 --> 02:57:16,200
Or actually, no, I take that back.

3386
02:57:16,200 --> 02:57:18,660
It doesn't have to be for the account that you bought it on.

3387
02:57:18,660 --> 02:57:23,560
It says that the access is applied to the EA account, so meaning if you buy Battlefield

3388
02:57:23,560 --> 02:57:27,200
3 on the PC, you can get the demo on the PlayStation 3, or whatever you wanna do.

3389
02:57:27,200 --> 02:57:30,200
So it's kind of tradeable amongst those.

3390
02:57:30,200 --> 02:57:31,960
That's kinda neat.

3391
02:57:31,960 --> 02:57:35,040
There will be other ways for the rest of us to get in there if you're not buying Battlefield

3392
02:57:35,040 --> 02:57:38,680
3, so don't cry.

3393
02:57:38,680 --> 02:57:43,920
Lastly but not leastly, a couple of tweets from Ramaditya Knight sends us some tweets.

3394
02:57:43,920 --> 02:57:44,920
Hey, OLR!

3395
02:57:44,920 --> 02:57:50,000
The Sonic 1 and 2 soundtrack to celebrate his 20th birthday has been released this month,

3396
02:57:50,000 --> 02:57:51,560
so if you're a Sonic fan, you should go get it.

3397
02:57:51,560 --> 02:57:54,720
I seem to remember a story on that coming up before, like when it was first announced,

3398
02:57:54,720 --> 02:57:56,600
but it's good to know that it's out.

3399
02:57:56,600 --> 02:58:02,320
And you might remember that name, Ramaditya Knight does a lot of these tin whistle or

3400
02:58:02,320 --> 02:58:03,680
the recorder.

3401
02:58:03,680 --> 02:58:07,640
He does a lot of these songs, and he sent us a new YouTube at his account, which is

3402
02:58:07,640 --> 02:58:16,440
Ramaditya Skywalker, and he's actually playing the Green Hill Zone theme.

3403
02:58:16,440 --> 02:58:23,440
Obviously he's using the background, but that might not be the best part, where he's playing

3404
02:58:23,440 --> 02:58:26,440
the same three notes over and over.

3405
02:58:26,440 --> 02:58:29,600
That's a little better.

3406
02:58:29,600 --> 02:58:31,440
Still irritating.

3407
02:58:31,440 --> 02:58:36,520
Hey, hey, hey, I don't see you playing a musical instrument, I don't think you should be making

3408
02:58:36,520 --> 02:58:37,520
fun.

3409
02:58:37,520 --> 02:58:39,120
I don't think you should be making fun.

3410
02:58:39,120 --> 02:58:42,520
I think you're talented, don't listen to Loki.

3411
02:58:42,520 --> 02:58:44,880
I played the clarinet when I was younger.

3412
02:58:44,880 --> 02:58:45,880
You sure did.

3413
02:58:45,880 --> 02:58:47,280
I sure did.

3414
02:58:47,280 --> 02:58:50,520
I probably couldn't play that on the clarinet anymore, I could probably play the squeak

3415
02:58:50,520 --> 02:58:53,280
song, that's probably about all I could play on the clarinet these days.

3416
02:58:53,280 --> 02:58:54,280
Band geek.

3417
02:58:54,280 --> 02:58:57,360
Shut up, what's wrong with being a band geek?

3418
02:58:57,360 --> 02:59:01,000
I tried to be a band geek, but I was too weak to carry my instrument and I was picked on.

3419
02:59:01,000 --> 02:59:03,520
That's because you tried to play the fucking tuba, and you were-

3420
02:59:03,520 --> 02:59:04,520
No, trombone.

3421
02:59:04,520 --> 02:59:05,520
Oh, my bad.

3422
02:59:05,520 --> 02:59:07,600
You were like this, weren't you like a really scrawny kid?

3423
02:59:07,600 --> 02:59:08,600
Oh, yeah.

3424
02:59:08,600 --> 02:59:11,600
And now you're like six foot four, like you just-

3425
02:59:11,600 --> 02:59:16,640
I'm still weak as hell, but I'm six foot four-ish, so there's at least a lot of me, yeah.

3426
02:59:16,640 --> 02:59:23,040
All right, and the chat room is asking for a link of Ramaditya Knight's performance there,

3427
02:59:23,040 --> 02:59:28,400
and stupid me forgot to link that, so let me do that right now for the chatters in the

3428
02:59:28,400 --> 02:59:33,960
chat room at chat.orangelaungeradio.com, there you go.

3429
02:59:33,960 --> 02:59:39,240
There it is, and Rama says in chat room, chat.orangelaungeradio.com, and now Skye plays the skin flute.

3430
02:59:39,240 --> 02:59:41,360
Yeah, screw you.

3431
02:59:41,360 --> 02:59:43,840
All right.

3432
02:59:43,840 --> 02:59:45,200
That's it, we're done.

3433
02:59:45,200 --> 02:59:46,960
We're wrapping up another episode of Orange Lawns Radio.

3434
02:59:46,960 --> 02:59:50,400
I gotta ask first if there's any last minute stories, Loki?

3435
02:59:50,400 --> 02:59:52,600
Yeah, there's just one.

3436
02:59:52,600 --> 03:00:01,840
It was basically, they announced that in Sonic Generations, you can unlock the original Sonic

3437
03:00:01,840 --> 03:00:04,080
the Hedgehog game.

3438
03:00:04,080 --> 03:00:05,080
Again?

3439
03:00:05,080 --> 03:00:06,720
Yeah, that's totally new news.

3440
03:00:06,720 --> 03:00:09,440
How many times did they release the first Sonic game for real?

3441
03:00:09,440 --> 03:00:14,040
Absolutely, brand new news, unless you listened to our show back in August, in which I actually

3442
03:00:14,040 --> 03:00:15,680
revealed that same thing.

3443
03:00:15,680 --> 03:00:18,640
So yeah, totally new.

3444
03:00:18,640 --> 03:00:24,920
Well, if you somehow missed out on your nine other opportunities to re-buy Sonic the Hedgehog,

3445
03:00:24,920 --> 03:00:26,960
the original, here you go.

3446
03:00:26,960 --> 03:00:31,080
Sonic Generations is a bet, and they have a couple dev ones now if you wanna check them

3447
03:00:31,080 --> 03:00:32,080
out.

3448
03:00:32,080 --> 03:00:33,080
All right.

3449
03:00:33,080 --> 03:00:35,360
Well, that's gonna wrap up another episode of Orange Lawns Radio.

3450
03:00:35,360 --> 03:00:38,080
We're gonna go around first and get everybody's final thought.

3451
03:00:38,080 --> 03:00:42,160
And my final thought tonight is skinny fries.

3452
03:00:42,160 --> 03:00:43,160
I am full of them.

3453
03:00:43,160 --> 03:00:44,160
We ate that whole bag.

3454
03:00:44,160 --> 03:00:45,160
I know, we're fat.

3455
03:00:45,160 --> 03:00:46,160
Actually, you know what though?

3456
03:00:46,160 --> 03:00:47,800
In that entire bag, there's only six grams of fat.

3457
03:00:47,800 --> 03:00:48,800
That's not that bad.

3458
03:00:48,800 --> 03:00:50,800
There's more grams of fat in a muffin.

3459
03:00:50,800 --> 03:00:51,800
All right.

3460
03:00:51,800 --> 03:00:53,000
So let's just pop.

3461
03:00:53,000 --> 03:00:54,000
What's your final thought tonight?

3462
03:00:54,000 --> 03:00:56,880
Thank you for being here, by the way, and filling in.

3463
03:00:56,880 --> 03:00:57,880
Always appreciate it.

3464
03:00:57,880 --> 03:00:58,880
You're welcome.

3465
03:00:58,880 --> 03:00:59,880
Always a pleasure.

3466
03:00:59,880 --> 03:01:00,880
Thank you.

3467
03:01:00,880 --> 03:01:01,880
Thank you for the food.

3468
03:01:01,880 --> 03:01:02,880
Because I'm hungry.

3469
03:01:02,880 --> 03:01:05,440
Are you getting a headache again?

3470
03:01:05,440 --> 03:01:06,440
Kind of.

3471
03:01:06,440 --> 03:01:07,440
My stomach's been kickin'.

3472
03:01:07,440 --> 03:01:08,440
Poor thing.

3473
03:01:08,440 --> 03:01:10,000
And low-key, last but not least, your final thought tonight.

3474
03:01:10,000 --> 03:01:12,120
Crackers need to get crackin'.

3475
03:01:12,120 --> 03:01:14,000
All right.

3476
03:01:14,000 --> 03:01:16,200
That's gonna do it for another episode of Orange Lawns Radio.

3477
03:01:16,200 --> 03:01:21,040
If you liked our show, you know all we ask you guys, tell a friend or two about the show.

3478
03:01:21,040 --> 03:01:25,040
We don't have advertising, big dollars, you know, we're not a huge operation.

3479
03:01:25,040 --> 03:01:27,280
Word of mouth is really what keeps our show alive.

3480
03:01:27,280 --> 03:01:29,080
Leave us a nice review on iTunes if you could.

3481
03:01:29,080 --> 03:01:30,760
We haven't gotten any of those in a long time.

3482
03:01:30,760 --> 03:01:32,320
It's been about a month or two.

3483
03:01:32,320 --> 03:01:34,560
So we really appreciate those.

3484
03:01:34,560 --> 03:01:39,020
Listen to Hoard House, if you like World of Warcraft or Blizzard stuff, HoardHouse.com.

3485
03:01:39,020 --> 03:01:43,160
And of course, this is the last time we can ask you to do this, so please, please write

3486
03:01:43,160 --> 03:01:44,260
yourself a reminder.

3487
03:01:44,260 --> 03:01:48,800
Ask Siri to remind you every day, vote in the podcast awards for Orange Lawns Radio.

3488
03:01:48,800 --> 03:01:50,400
Best gaming podcast.

3489
03:01:50,400 --> 03:01:54,280
Really appreciate a vote for our friends over at the Geek Spin and Pod Safe Music as well.

3490
03:01:54,280 --> 03:01:55,280
You know, help us win.

3491
03:01:55,280 --> 03:01:56,580
That'll go a long way in promoting.

3492
03:01:56,580 --> 03:01:59,000
We really, really appreciate every single vote.

3493
03:01:59,000 --> 03:02:02,200
Even if we don't win, we have really felt a lot of love from the community, which has

3494
03:02:02,200 --> 03:02:03,200
been great.

3495
03:02:03,200 --> 03:02:06,980
Like, you know, I've seen like other podcasters like retweeting and like supporting us, especially

3496
03:02:06,980 --> 03:02:07,980
the All Games family.

3497
03:02:07,980 --> 03:02:12,320
So I really, before we sign off tonight, want to give a heartfelt thank you to all the All

3498
03:02:12,320 --> 03:02:16,520
Games people who have really rallied behind us and in helping us to win.

3499
03:02:16,520 --> 03:02:24,600
And if, if, if, if, if we do win, it will be in large part thanks to that and all of

3500
03:02:24,600 --> 03:02:25,600
their efforts.

3501
03:02:25,600 --> 03:02:28,320
So really, really, really appreciate it.

3502
03:02:28,320 --> 03:02:30,560
So I guess that's going to do it.

3503
03:02:30,560 --> 03:02:31,560
We'll be back next week.

3504
03:02:31,560 --> 03:02:33,080
Dark Sakura will be back from Disneyland.

3505
03:02:33,080 --> 03:02:36,740
I'm sure to tell us all about her adventures on Space Mountain, maybe at Electronica or

3506
03:02:36,740 --> 03:02:38,200
whatever else she's been doing there.

3507
03:02:38,200 --> 03:02:44,800
And we'll talk about whatever else comes up in gaming with our bit of wit and sassy commentary.

3508
03:02:44,800 --> 03:02:47,740
Until then, be safe.

3509
03:02:47,740 --> 03:02:48,740
Don't be a dick.

3510
03:02:48,740 --> 03:02:49,740
We'll see you next week.

3511
03:02:49,740 --> 03:02:53,740
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
