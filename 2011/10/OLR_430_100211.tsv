14983	18585	More lies, more lies, more lies.
18605	20406	This will be edited out later.
20446	20566	Bye.
33700	38523	Hello, welcome to episode 430 of Orange Lounge Radio.
38843	40504	We are awesome!
41265	42126	And Rob's not here.
42966	48069	No, actually, we are the show that tells gamers what they really want to know.
48830	50251	And I am your host for tonight.
50411	52753	I am DarkSakura, and with us is Loki.
53353	53573	Hi.
54394	60338	And our special guest tonight is some dude that I picked up on the internet, Dan.
62019	62459	I'm a hobo.
63464	68550	Yeah, so again, it's Sunday night, 6 o'clock Pacific time.
69090	75597	And you can join us on allgames.com and listen to us live and hang out in our chat room at allgames.com.
75958	76999	Why am I not allgames.com?
77019	77760	That's Bobby's chat room.
78100	80703	At Orange Lounge, in Pound Orange Lounge.
81324	84808	And you can also follow the chat at orangeloungeradio.com.
85268	99140	So yeah, it's another derpisode because Rob's not here and I'm kind of ill-prepared So why don't we just go ahead and skip the formalities and go to how was our gaming week And mine, I played WoW for 20 minutes a day every day, that's it Loki?
99340	100041	Just 20 minutes?
100561	107287	Pretty much, except for the other night when I was doing the pet hunt How do you even play WoW for 20 minutes?
107788	110230	I just go on to do dailies Wow
113174	125965	I played quite a few things actually this week besides the usual stuff more Grand Theft Auto, more Earth Defense Force Insect Armageddon I did play a few things including some stuff I should be playing
128888	145765	Tiny Tower, I played a little bit of that just because I realized that there is an update to it and I did the update and bought the two extra shops of each kind and a few extra residential floors and added those all in there and my tower is super huge.
146105	146986	Thanks for watching!
163397	163617	I did.
164358	173160	And then also on iOS, I checked out Katamari Amore, which is the new Katamari game for the iPod, iPad, iPhone.
174040	175141	And it's alright.
175201	183383	Once again, I don't really care too much for touchscreen controls for a lot of stuff, especially when it comes to virtual thumbsticks, but
184004	185386	It's alright, it works pretty good.
186127	195360	And you can check out the free version, which is basically just a time trial level that's only two minutes long.
196001	198886	And if you want the rest of it, you can buy the download pack, which is $3.99.
200785	205488	It's alright, but definitely if you're thinking about picking it up, try the demo first.
206188	209910	And then if you like it, then go ahead and pay for the full thing.
211171	216514	And then finally, the other thing I really shouldn't have been playing is a leaked game that came out.
217535	221437	It's a leaked Xbox Live arcade game called Saints Row Money Shot.
221557	223278	Now I'm not sure if this is actually a game that got...
223618	224940	Thanks for watching!
234145	237068	Unlocks for Saints Row the Third in the game itself.
237188	242373	You can unlock the hover bike and this sniper outfit and one of the sniper rifles.
243033	259769	But basically the whole game's premise is very similar to the movie Wanted or at least a section of it where you're firing the sniper rifle and actually controlling the trajectory of the bullet as you're flying to your intended target.
260869	264250	You can hit different things that interact with the environment.
265011	273134	You'll have different goals like kill three pigeons, get a bunch of close calls, and that kind of thing.
273274	280476	You unlock different bullets to have more speed, more turning ability, that kind of stuff.
280556	284898	Seriously, when they're moving faster, it's a lot harder to actually play the game, but
285998	303183	Um, some of the cool stuff you can do, you know, there's one part where you hit a wine bottle of this couple that's, you know, sitting there having a nice dinner in their, you know, condo or apartment and that unfortunately causes the bottle to shatter and hit the candle that's on the table and they both catch on fire.
303863	312386	Or another one where it knocks out the cane of an old woman and there's implied, you know, oral sex there and funny stuff like that.
312546	312886	But, uh,
313993	314534	Rated E for Everyone
323945	329587	It's definitely not the Saints Row drive-by game that was supposed to become an Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network.
330027	334889	That was going to be kind of like its own thing, and that was the one that was supposed to become the 3DS.
335829	340490	But this game may very well come to Xbox Live Arcade.
341431	344652	I would imagine this month, if it's going to come at all.
347054	374215	I don't know, it was alright it was a little bit boring because there's only really three story levels the rest are kind of practice training levels but then again this isn't really a finished build of the game it's something that came out back in June but I don't know it'll be cool, I definitely would want to check out the full version if it did come out just at the very least for the unlocks and that's pretty much it, that's all I've been playing
377981	379022	Well, sweetie?
380062	380382	Yes?
380763	381563	What have you been playing?
383924	385185	I played some Tetris DS.
385705	386426	Woo!
386686	387866	You've been watching a lot of videos.
388166	392369	I spent a little time in the vault last week and played some Genesis stuff.
393309	395310	Besides that, nothing really current.
396711	398332	No, but you have been watching a lot of videos.
398932	399633	I watched a couple.
400493	401874	I watched a playthrough of Sapphire today.
402034	402954	That was kind of a cool game.
403395	403995	I love that game.
404821	405881	You didn't even know what it was.
405941	406401	What's this?
406681	409762	Well, no, I just walked in and it looked like a tank game for a minute.
409782	410682	And I was like, wait, that's not a tank game.
410702	411643	It didn't look like a tank game at all.
411663	413843	This is a big skull and I forgot that level, so shut up.
414043	415564	You know what you're talking about.
416624	417344	Okay, you're fired.
418084	418244	Ah.
420245	421445	Everyone, Dan's kicked off the show.
421965	422465	Damn it.
423485	424346	Okay, you're rehired.
425126	426266	If you go get me something to drink.
427526	427666	No.
428847	429607	Okay, you're fired again.
431357	435040	So anyway, a little bit of housekeeping.
435160	436982	Basically, Rob's at Disneyland.
437782	438903	And we're all super jealous.
439704	440464	Well, at least I am.
441825	442746	Dan, are you super jealous?
443687	446309	I really want to see Space Mountain Ghost Galaxy.
447030	450272	Well, if all plans out, we're going.
450693	451153	But not now.
452214	452354	Maybe.
452374	452474	Maybe.
452922	453223	Never.
454104	461276	So anyway, let's go ahead and move on from, let's move past Rob's absence and I'm over it.
461376	461857	I'm over it.
461977	463740	I was a little upset for a while, but now I'm over it.
464461	466464	So how about we launch into the first story?
466957	467317	XBOX 360 DASHBOARD
485053	507402	Which is going to be part of the new dashboard, they're going to be adding PayPal payments It's listed the release of this as November 15th And of course the dashboard update kind of refreshes the whole look of it Kind of gives it the Windows Phone, Windows 8 kind of look to the whole thing Which I kind of hate, but whatever Um
509790	510871	Thanks for watching!
527594	528214	So we have that.
528374	537017	And then, of course, some more information regarding the supposed Xbox TV service they're going to be having.
537978	542159	Some of the content providers that they're going to be featuring on this, according to Bloomberg.
543160	552903	Comcast, Verizon, they're also expecting to get HBO, Crackle, Bravo, SyFy, Love Film, and a lot more.
556341	560084	I guess also some stuff from Amazon as well.
560445	568090	So it looks like they're going to be trying to source content from, I think not only just cable providers, but actual cable content providers.
570345	593733	on top of just actual the cable companies so maybe for example if you don't have cable you may not be just locked out of all this which would be nice because I would prefer not to have cable but getting a somewhat okay deal right now but in the years time that may change and it'd be nice to have some extra sources of content other than the internet.
595313	612199	and of course I'll probably get a nice little peek of this pretty soon considering that the dev kit dashboard update that's the preview for this fall thing also leaked to the internet and been taken down pretty quickly but
613739	619765	Happened to snag a copy for my dev kit before it did get taken down, so I will get a chance to check that out.
620166	626852	Although, based on the YouTube videos I've seen, it's still rather boring because it's basically what you see in the screenshots.
628194	629896	Because it's an Xbox menu.
630716	635401	Well, it's like, I don't understand, with each update, they kind of make it worse.
635761	637283	Bring back the blades, damn it.
638106	640068	I mean, that's what I use pretty much now anyways.
640128	640889	It's just the blades.
640949	642751	Just hit the guide button, the blades come up.
642811	649598	And I'm hoping that's still the case with this because I just really don't care for the new update.
649639	650960	And I understand why they're doing it.
650980	654524	It's because they can say, hey, look at all this ad space we've got.
654644	656106	We can advertise games.
656146	657387	We can advertise services.
657427	658828	We can have third-party ads.
659609	661951	That's really what it's come down to.
662731	666393	That's kind of scary if you think about it because they're going to do the same thing with Windows 8.
666773	670676	Thankfully, Windows 8, you can turn that off, kind of like you can turn off Media Center.
672497	672897	I don't know.
672977	676359	I wish it was optional like Media Center.
677900	682543	I would think by now we have the technology to where we can customize the way that the dashboard looks.
683123	685424	If I want the Windows 8 look, cool, I can do that.
685484	687906	If I want the old one, cool, I should be able to do that as well.
688353	698122	you know what I like about the updates to the dashboard and it's not really even specific to the dashboard but just part of the whole update package I like the fact that they stopped making the avatars look retarded
699042	705464	They're like reproportioned a little bit so their heads aren't all stupidly huge and they look a little bit more like people but they still look like avatars.
706084	706704	That's awesome.
707544	708885	The Miis still look like bobbleheads.
709625	710865	They're supposed to look like bobbleheads.
710905	711845	Miis always sucked.
712225	716367	The Xbox ones I thought weren't supposed to have that bobbleheaded look so I like it too.
716607	716787	Right.
716887	721848	The avatars are like kind of neat but the Miis, yeah, were always just sort of creepy looking.
722495	722695	Yeah.
723575	723756	Yeah.
725596	726957	So, I don't know.
727277	730258	We'll just... It's only, what, a month away?
730498	733400	So, I mean... Whatever.
733980	738562	I'm just glad I'm not participating in the fall preview because I fucking hated that.
738902	741683	It's just like, oh, hey, look, we're pushing another dashboard update to you.
742383	743104	Every day.
743444	744204	Twice a day.
744304	748426	It's like, oh, I have to sit here for another ten minutes while this shit downloads.
749955	774823	It wasn't worth it And I didn't even get anything free out of it Like the people that tested Was it the last dashboard thing with the XGT 3 stuff Where you got a free copy of Reach That didn't even work Well at least when they updated it Well you still get a games on demand version Sweet Yeah it's not too bad If you don't like hard drive space It's great
776888	777248	My turn?
777809	778069	Yes.
778269	778749	Okay.
779170	779990	Hey, guess what?
780090	783572	Microsoft's coming out with a new Windows phone that nobody's going to buy.
783912	784653	Who's surprised?
784773	791596	It has swappable controller pads so you can have a keyboard, a touchscreen, an extended battery, or a game controller.
792097	795859	The problem is it's a Windows phone and everybody hates Windows phones.
796659	797880	Totally hate Windows phones.
798191	799652	Microsoft doesn't hate Windows phones.
799692	805057	I mean, after all, they're redesigning Windows to look like they're Windows phones.
805798	808000	They're just redesigning Windows to work on tablets.
808541	810142	That's the future for Microsoft.
810162	812284	They want to get into the tablet business.
812645	813806	And you can turn it off.
815000	815581	What, the phone?
815801	816862	No, with the PC version.
817723	818224	Turn what off?
818384	821608	You can turn off that tablet interface and go back to a classic interface on Windows 8.
821648	826114	Yeah, I understand that, but the damages are even done as far as... You mean you can make Windows look like Windows?
826775	827696	Score!
829867	833288	I'm really sad that they took out the support to make Windows look like Windows 3.1.
836710	838390	You can make Windows look like old Windows?
838890	839391	Score!
839751	842772	Honestly, I am so ready for Windows to be radically different.
843392	844353	I mean, it's fine.
844413	846954	Windows is Windows, and you're used to Windows being what it is.
847034	853376	But it is sort of like, man, I sure would like to see Windows do something different.
854042	862510	And I don't really think Windows now, I mean, there's not anything I've done and said, you know, I really wish Windows 7 did this.
863952	865073	I'm fine with Windows 7.
865333	867075	Windows 7 does everything I need it to do.
867275	871059	I don't need to interact with social networks any more than I already am.
872220	874242	I don't need them to post an update.
874962	876264	Matt just opened Calculator.
877602	903637	no one fucking cares you know what's gonna happen is they're gonna get this whole thing with perfect social network integration and right then the whole world's gonna be like we're done with social networks let's move on to something else that's lame you know what when I looked at your article that top attachment I swear looked like a Wiimote that's right it's the new Wii Microsoft phone Mike I got nothing
904471	905012	Microwee.
906674	906995	Nice.
907736	908156	Yeah.
909378	909999	Well, I don't know.
910039	912743	That kind of goes with what our friend used to call Microsoft Microflacid.
914770	919512	Anyway, how about some news that makes everybody happy because it has to do with Portal.
920612	931176	There is new download content for Portal 2 which is called Peer Review and it is a free download for PC, PS3, and Xbox 360 available on October 4th.
932217	942361	It has more of the co-op modes for Atlas and Peabody who are the cutie little robots that like to hug so much and hey, this article has my desktop wallpaper on it.
943081	945903	Gladass will be there, so that's going to be cool.
946043	949926	And there's also a challenge mode for co-op and single player that has leaderboard support.
950847	963055	And if you want some more free stuff, the third and fourth group of tracks from the Portal 2 soundtrack, Music to Test By, is on Valve's site right now, which I need to download them.
963176	966658	Probably some more ringtones and message sounds, I bet.
968700	968920	Cool.
969360	971982	I actually have the Turret Symphony as one of my ringtones.
974622	978980	The little one that you hear the four little turrets practicing in the little level.
979220	980265	You must be so proud.
981155	982076	I am, shut up.
982096	984518	I'm not proud of your face.
986779	988421	Okay, well that's it for that one.
989161	1003312	Well, this is a little bit interesting and a little bit disappointing because I kind of, I read this and you know, I was craving Subway anyways because I had a coupon for it and although it wasn't for the store I went to.
1003332	1004733	Yeah, why do you need a coupon for Subway?
1004793	1005273	It's all $5 anyway.
1006437	1007318	Uncharted 3 Uncharted 3
1035675	1036216	Dude, I saw that.
1036236	1036958	I should have got a drink.
1040543	1042663	Yeah, it's a 30 ounce drink.
1043063	1058966	And basically, not only do you get a PlayStation Network code for that to play the multiplayer portion of the game, but you also get an exclusive item which earns you the ability to do the subway footlong taunt.
1059146	1062087	You know, the $5 footlong thing that they do in the commercials?
1062287	1062667	Nice.
1063067	1068148	So you have that taunt as well that you can earn from getting a drink.
1068502	1070623	And here I was all ready to get a drink.
1070763	1073465	In fact... You even got a drink.
1073705	1074325	Yeah, well, no.
1074606	1083911	To go back to what I was talking about earlier before the show started, how the person at Subway was really stupid, I asked for a large drink, and she rang me up for a small drink.
1084431	1085752	Because she is stupid.
1086632	1088653	Did you reach across the counter and pimp-slop her?
1088934	1094857	I should have, but once again, though, I looked at their cups, and their cups did not have the new stuff on them.
1095307	1103273	I'm sure that participation will vary by location based on whether they're phasing out their old inventory or not.
1103573	1106015	Often those promotions are even no purchase required.
1106055	1108677	You can probably just ask for a code and they have to give it to you.
1111494	1115136	Maybe, but I'm sure this woman would have not known what the hell I was talking about.
1115156	1116716	Should have been like, footlongs are $5!
1116756	1117377	Woo!
1118517	1119438	Exactly.
1119478	1121539	Yay, footlongs $5, yay.
1122339	1121539	$5.
1122459	1126681	And I'm probably trying to get you really psyched up about the online portion of Uncharted.
1126741	1126981	Uncharted 3
1151755	1152136	DarkSakura.com
1170592	1177840	And of course, this is to combat piracy, but really it's just, you know, make a little money on the back end from used copies.
1178020	1180183	It's what you call a shameless cash grab.
1181204	1183066	And a way to put the screws to GameStop.
1183446	1186269	And which I'm kind of down with, because fuck GameStop!
1187150	1188812	No, I don't have any problem with GameStop, really.
1188852	1189973	I have a problem with GameStop.
1190970	1193811	Yeah, me too.
1194131	1195572	Hey, you like movies?
1195932	1196092	No.
1196452	1197273	You like zombies?
1197493	1197733	Yes.
1198253	1199594	You like movies about zombies?
1199774	1200054	Yes.
1200194	1201975	You like movies based on video games?
1202515	1202735	What?
1204082	1204842	I like Wild Zero.
1233277	1234478	Good.
1235359	1238021	Great.
1238501	1240883	If you like zombie movies, there's more coming.
1241103	1243945	If you like Dead Island, watch the big screen.
1245706	1249249	And, I mean, they're trying to make it an emotional zombie movie.
1249269	1254753	So they're basing it off a trailer, which is great because the trailer had nothing to do with the actual game.
1255233	1257015	Aren't zombie movies always pretty emotional?
1258975	1261136	Zombies are into the pursuit of brains.
1261516	1263136	That's heartfelt right there.
1263836	1264436	They're like, brain.
1264456	1266317	I feel for their play.
1266377	1268177	And people run in fear with great passion.
1269997	1270418	People?
1270678	1271698	There's people in these movies?
1272158	1273718	Yeah, the people that end up being food.
1273798	1275019	I thought people were just food.
1275399	1280020	And you know what's kind of annoying, though, is all these zombie movies nowadays, especially starting after, what was it, 28 Days?
1282335	1284537	Yeah, they all have the smart killer zombies.
1284777	1285838	Like the ones that run.
1286118	1290001	They don't have the shuffling undead because the shuffling undead aren't interesting anymore.
1290301	1295685	But the funny thing about zombie movies was it was always just about the fact that they were slow but unstoppable.
1296166	1298227	Now they're all fast and unstoppable.
1298608	1300449	And they're fast and unstoppable when they think.
1300729	1302111	Which, you know what that really makes them?
1302531	1304312	Not fucking zombies.
1305673	1306474	Really, guys.
1307174	1311498	I want them to do a zombie movie where the people aren't zombies but all the animals are.
1312332	1313152	You know what would be great?
1313433	1313793	Like zombie cows.
1313813	1315414	They did a movie about Resident Evil.
1315954	1319536	Yeah, well, kind of like Pet Sematary, yeah, but they're all like church and the people don't come back.
1320316	1321397	But they're attacking all the people.
1322597	1323217	Zombie animals.
1323698	1325459	But would they turn the people into zombies?
1325839	1326599	No, they'd just eat them.
1328520	1329080	I'd watch that.
1329441	1330121	That'd be a good movie.
1330981	1333863	Copyright, Dark Sakura, 2011, blah, blah, blah, blah.
1333883	1335364	That movie sounds really stupid.
1335584	1335984	So do you.
1336604	1337405	Okay, next story.
1337565	1338145	You got me there.
1338973	1339653	I love you, mean it.
1370234	1372995	They are being distributed.
1373115	1374415	It's distributed in the U.S.
1374495	1380697	by the same people that do PlayStation, the official magazine, official Xbox magazine, and of course there's Nintendo Power.
1381137	1383678	They do Best Buys at Gamer and PC Gamer.
1384518	1396181	And they're actually saying that since people are, you know, first of all, poor, broke, you can't see the magazine very well at the newsstand.
1396201	1398262	I mean, it's really not getting a big order anymore.
1398802	1401624	And the digital revenues are where the money is.
1402044	1408248	Basically, they're thinking about changing how they do Nintendo Power in the U.S.
1409069	1413391	They are thinking about doing it digital only instead of doing it in print.
1413511	1418274	But then again, as someone pointed out earlier in chat, EGM went away and they came back.
1422097	1427460	In my world, when Nintendo quit publishing Nintendo Power, it quit being Nintendo Power.
1428894	1430015	It just did.
1430595	1432957	It was the end of an era then.
1433117	1436479	Now if it goes away, it's just another magazine going away.
1436819	1440722	But when Nintendo published it, it was the official Nintendo propaganda magazine.
1440742	1442583	That would be like Napster going away now.
1442963	1445585	Who cares?
1445705	1448587	In fact, when you said Napster, I'm like, is Napster still around?
1448627	1449067	Yeah, it is.
1449227	1451068	It's a legit music service now.
1453010	1453690	No one cared.
1453870	1456572	When they're like, we're going legit, everyone's like, we're going elsewhere.
1456592	1456672	Yeah.
1457190	1457751	Exactly.
1458171	1460253	I was like, wait a minute, I can't steal music for free?
1460653	1461514	Fuck this.
1461974	1462535	I'm out.
1463055	1475566	Well, according to Gamasutra, Future is going to be doing their update for their plan starting on, I believe, they're going to show what the plan is for November 24th and later through 2012.
1477067	1477648	If anyone cares.
1478629	1479390	Some people care.
1479670	1480030	Damn it.
1480490	1480891	I care.
1481071	1481391	A little.
1484014	1484294	Next.
1484892	1485253	Well, cool.
1485273	1490480	Let's talk a little bit about what's coming out soon, starting with October in the US.
1490500	1490721	Oh, wait.
1490781	1491722	Isn't this hard music?
1492463	1494206	No, we don't have music for this section.
1494386	1495648	Well, I did it anyway.
1495888	1496890	We have music.
1497751	1498632	Okay, so what's coming out?
1498652	1499794	I refuse to have music.
1500094	1500395	Fine.
1503291	1509374	Anyways, today actually Tetris Axis came out on Nintendo 3DS and it was great.
1509874	1520279	Earlier this week Kotaku had actually run a little bit of they do this stupid video blogging crap for some of the games that they get to test and stuff like, oh look, we got the test!
1520559	1526781	And they were showing off the augmented reality portions of Tetris Axis and man, that looks retarded.
1527822	1532784	I'm so glad that I'm not a big Tetris fan because it's just like, hey look, I put
1533004	1534885	Dark Souls on PS3 and Xbox 360 Sometimes you're clever
1562399	1573371	Gunslingers coming out on the Wii and this is kind of an on-rails western shooter game NBA 2K12 coming out on PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii and PSP
1577795	1607132	Rage coming out on PS3, Xbox 360, and PC Age of Enigma, The Secret of the Sixth Ghost on PC No idea what that is Spider-Man Edge of Time on PS3, Xbox 360, Wii, 3DS, and NDS Hopefully it's not as terrible as X-Men Destiny because that game has gotten some pretty terrible reviews That game got murdered in the reviews
1607813	1611314	It's really nice that you put this unfinished game out.
1611615	1613115	You know what's sad about that game too?
1613615	1621439	It's made by Silicon Knights who at one time was a really decent publisher and now they're just bootsy.
1624900	1627441	Girls Only coming out on Nintendo DS.
1628441	1629522	It is for girls only.
1630662	1634784	They will shoot you on sight if you try to buy that and you're not a girl.
1634984	1636905	I was hoping it would be like Boobalicious or something.
1637989	1639192	No, it's not that good.
1639252	1639813	I'm sorry.
1639873	1644405	It's just some crappy girl-targeted game.
1644866	1645948	How to knit and shop.
1651457	1668489	Face Raiders Photo Finish 3DS It's an awesome kart racing game where you can take a picture and put your face on the kart or the person driving the kart because everybody really wants to do that in a stupid kart racing game You know you can do that on the arcade version of Mario Kart?
1669190	1676575	Completely unaware of that I'm so unaware of that I'm glad I have no memory of doing that at my bachelor party
1676875	1677255	Oh, good.
1681199	1681999	That wasn't your face.
1683601	1687564	Sid Meier's Civilization V Game of the Year Edition on PC.
1687904	1689826	And they made me drive as Luigi.
1690066	1691727	That is just a crime right there.
1692348	1693068	I think it was Luigi.
1693969	1695390	I was so messed up.
1696431	1698532	I have no memory of it until I saw the video.
1700334	1702716	Gabrielle's Ghostly Groove on the 3DS.
1702796	1703917	It's a rhythm music game.
1704878	1705038	Um...
1706730	1717643	and then finally one week from today Just Dance 3 coming out on Xbox 360 and Wii, Playstation 3 who the hell knows when that's coming out because it's been delayed that is it
1719762	1724345	Alright, so for everyone in, I guess this is the UK, is this all of Europe?
1724505	1746720	This is UK Hey, for everyone in the UK, here's some releases this week Really the only one that matters, Chrono Trigger hits PSN on the 4th Crisis for the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3 NBA Jam on Fire Edition, which is a download Orcs Must Die That sounds fun I gotta believe that's a download, I'm not really sure I think all those are downloads so far
1747062	1754506	Payday the High, Sega Bass Fishing Space Channel 5 Part 2 all that crap comes out on the 5th it's like really?
1755867	1766953	Dark Souls for the 360 and PS3 on the 7th NBA 2K12, Power Up Heroes and Rage as well as the Cursed Crusade all land on the 7th as well
1767537	1771339	I'm actually really interested to check out Crysis on 360 when that comes out.
1771419	1772600	That's actually next week, I believe.
1774902	1779425	Because I played it on PC and it was pretty fun up until the end where the game decided, hey, you know what?
1780205	1780445	Work?
1780725	1781286	I don't want to do it.
1781926	1784848	I'm interested to see it from a technological standpoint.
1785308	1788911	Crysis, you know, was a real system killer.
1789651	1792293	Yeah, it was a really unoptimized piece of shit.
1792373	1798757	I can't wait to see if they've managed to make it run well on the 360 and PS3, or if it's going to run like Crysis.
1799058	1800118	Well, they did with Warhead.
1800138	1802320	Remember, they totally revamped the whole engine.
1802340	1805422	It's like, oh, hey, yeah, by the way, remember that game that killed all your PCs?
1805762	1809345	Yeah, we finally got around to optimizing that, and now I can run in pretty much everything.
1809738	1810378	Well, that's what I'm saying.
1810398	1815600	I just want to see if it will run on the 360 and whatnot.
1815660	1820822	My understanding is that happens a lot, and I'll ask you about this later, but I was talking to someone about GTA for the PC.
1820942	1821302	Oh, yeah.
1821422	1824263	It's a terrible, very unoptimized.
1824323	1828525	It's like, oh, it takes such a PC to run it.
1828565	1833647	Did you see the link that I posted to the Vice City mod that somebody did?
1833707	1835727	Yeah, I think I've seen those mods before.
1835767	1836868	I've got to play that.
1837808	1838770	It's gonna be so good.
1839171	1842959	But anyways, so there's the releases for the UK.
1843460	1845545	I wonder what's coming out in Japan.
1846621	1847801	How about Child of Eden?
1848542	1849562	Coming out on the 6th.
1849642	1850142	How about it?
1850643	1852283	Well, this is the Xbox 360 list.
1853364	1861166	F1 2011, Ogumosukoku X, no, sorry, Kyoku X, my bad, Rage, and the Gun Stringer.
1862187	1873291	And moving forward to PlayStation 3, we have Major League Baseball 2K11, Child of Eden as well, and F1 2011.
1873391	1873531	What?
1877765	1878265	What did you say?
1878726	1879106	Sorry.
1879626	1879727	Oh.
1881948	1892216	God of War, Chains of Olympus, Ghost of Sparta, HD, Rage, World Soccer, Winning 11, 2012, Ace Combat, that's getting a little bit further past.
1892356	1892776	My bad.
1894598	1912936	on the Vita we have nothing because it's on the list for some stupid reason on the PSP .hack link for PSP the best it's a re-released AKB 148 that's idle to Guam to Koshitara and that's going to be a bunch of limited editions too
1913736	1934502	Okashina Shima no Peter Pan Sweet Neverland is also going to be out in a regular and limited edition and Phantom Kingdom Portable will be out on the 6th with a limited edition as well Tsugi no Giseisha o Oshirase Shimasu Kimitoko no Hateru Kotonai Kurayami o is going to be out on the 6th by BoostOn
1935782	1939245	and let's see what else we have on the Wii.
1939806	1942027	Just Dance Wii but that's not until next week.
1943128	1949834	On the 3DS we have Super Black Bass 3D Fight which makes fishing sound cool, I guess.
1950815	1954237	On the PS2, nothing because no one care.
1954998	1959702	And on the DS, nothing although Super Scribblenuts will be coming out next week which is kind of cool.
1960663	1964606	And for Japanese PC gamers, Batman Arkham City, Battlefield 3
1966361	1966761	That's about it.
1967381	1967661	Really?
1968382	1970022	There's some other stuff, but they're not giving us dates.
1970523	1971823	I'm surprised they're getting that so early.
1971863	1972364	No one cares.
1972604	1974345	Dude, Arkham City is going to be awesome.
1974665	1976846	Just says October and it's at the top of the list, so I said it.
1977226	1979547	That's probably just sometime in October.
1979607	1981008	I doubt that they're getting it that early.
1981328	1984230	No, but it gives our friends overseas something to look forward to.
1984750	1988031	Something you can look forward to, but when you go to the store this week, you're not going to find it there.
1989832	1991013	I didn't say it was this week.
1991033	1991853	I said it was this month.
1991873	1993074	Okay.
1995059	1996100	This is kind of strange.
1996161	2000745	They've got this game coming out for iOS called Life of George.
2000885	2006431	Now, you might be thinking, is this like some sort of documentary game based on George Washington?
2006451	2007031	No.
2007431	2011435	It's a Lego game, actually, where you're challenged to build...
2012256	2018540	Different things that you see in this photo album using actual bricks.
2019060	2021602	You buy a $30 kit from the Lego store.
2022102	2024404	You've already kind of lost me there because it's a $30 kit.
2024844	2026545	And I'm assuming it comes with like 10 pieces.
2028847	2029927	And you apparently...
2032142	2032762	Thanks for watching!
2052105	2075811	Really a $30 iOS game, and I mean, and I have not actually seen what this LEGO kit is, but I'm going to be willing to bet that it's probably, considering the price of LEGOs, which is really ridiculous, it's probably like 20 pieces, so it wouldn't be that difficult to recreate everything.
2076531	2078451	But just out of curiosity, let's see.
2078912	2080192	Life of George.
2080952	2083073	That actually does sound kind of cool.
2083814	2084934	Because you're a Lego addict.
2085054	2088076	And at the same time, devastatingly stupid.
2088896	2090717	Whoa, I am surprised.
2090837	2092578	It's actually 146 pieces.
2092758	2096220	That's actually not bad for Legos.
2096320	2099261	But from that picture, they're like really basic pieces.
2099582	2101342	Well, yeah, I'd imagine.
2102863	2106285	You know, I would probably just play with the Legos separately anyway and not care.
2107890	2109071	So, I just go buy Legos.
2109151	2111893	That game better be free once you buy that stupid kit.
2111993	2112894	That's all I gotta say.
2113895	2114595	No, it's $44.99.
2117157	2120020	That sounds to me like, was it TomTom or whatever like that?
2120120	2122261	Oh, hey, you gotta buy this GPS thing, $70.
2123122	2125124	Oh, did we mention the software's in there, $40.
2125844	2127205	Yeah, we hate you.
2127946	2131349	We want your money and you are gullible, so give it to us.
2132249	2132950	How's that, like that?
2134211	2134351	Yeah.
2134807	2135768	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2155667	2164836	And it's apparently super popular, but it's not getting a fall update, but it's not going away.
2164876	2169320	They just said that they plan to refresh the Texas heat season in the future.
2169661	2170782	So what does that mean?
2171963	2174505	That means that, oh, we're not going to change anything.
2174525	2176327	We're just going to say, oh, new tournament start.
2176387	2176988	Here's the same thing.
2179585	2180226	Thanks for watching!
2200285	2214598	This, I can see, you know, being able to play a lot more without actual structure in a season versus 1 vs. 100, which is more of like a trivia game that's kind of, you know, host-driven and it'd be a little difficult.
2214738	2218441	You know, I can see how they're able to carry it on beyond, you know, like a season.
2219522	2225127	Even the 1 vs. 100 extended play, though, just the practice rounds were fun just to pop on there and play.
2227040	2228981	I never played them, and I'm disappointed.
2229241	2234904	I'm actually very disappointed that Bob Saget was not the host on the online version.
2235205	2237046	Yeah, Bob Saget's a gangster.
2237886	2238466	He's so cool.
2240067	2246151	I mean, you know, actually there's been one poker game that's come out that I like, and that's Poker Night at the Inventory.
2246711	2248512	I still have got to download that.
2250640	2251621	Like I watched Jamie play.
2251641	2252661	See, I don't want to pay $4 for it, though.
2252701	2253142	You paid $4 for it.
2253162	2254462	You can play it on my computer.
2254863	2255663	I don't like your computer.
2255683	2255983	Cheapo.
2256363	2258985	Then put a copy of my account on your computer.
2259225	2260526	See, that's what I'm talking about.
2260546	2260526	$4.
2262387	2263687	You're so Dutch.
2263707	2264808	Do I look like I'm made of money?
2265268	2266029	You're so Dutch.
2266069	2266809	Whatever, Jew.
2267549	2267870	Dutch.
2270331	2271171	Okay, so anyway.
2273499	2283401	How about you talk about something that actually matters to people instead of just throwing out religious and ancestry-related comments?
2284241	2285962	What in the crap are you talking about?
2286482	2287782	Classic Game, duh.
2288722	2289723	Oh, Classic Game.
2290243	2291663	This isn't music for Classic Game.
2292663	2294904	This music is entirely too happy for Classic Game.
2297674	2298495	Start talking about it.
2298795	2300496	Is this really the music for classic games?
2300516	2301877	It's the intro music, dumbass.
2301917	2307041	I need something cool like the black hole music from one of the Advance Wars games.
2307061	2308042	That would be amazing.
2309003	2312926	How about this?
2313126	2313987	Pause that for a second.
2314266	2315086	I've got to play it in the background.
2316027	2320489	Anyways, before we get into this whole classic game of the week thing, I want to just throw this out there.
2320809	2325131	The whole reason Jamie's been doing this thing for years is because it was stolen from me.
2325651	2327532	I know everything about classic games.
2327572	2330314	La, la, la, la, la, la.
2330374	2330854	No, you're not.
2331334	2332415	I know everything about classic games.
2332475	2332975	I am the boss.
2333115	2334576	And everybody knows this, right?
2335456	2336659	I'm the master of the vault.
2337039	2339103	I'm the one who keeps and maintains the collection.
2339724	2343511	When Jamie comes to give you guys classic games, you know who she asks for them?
2344052	2344313	Me.
2345034	2347679	So anyways, if you like Classic Game of the Week, thank you.
2349068	2350309	I appreciate your work.
2350529	2354170	And I appreciate Jamie's work in bringing you so many classic games.
2354210	2355310	Dan's not getting laid tonight.
2355990	2356351	Whatever.
2356571	2357491	I was going to get laid anyway.
2357771	2361072	You can flip me the bird for like an hour if you really, really want to.
2361512	2363273	But anyways, okay.
2363813	2364873	Can I play the music again?
2364954	2365614	Start the music.
2365754	2366114	Shut up.
2369682	2370663	Tell them about the damn game.
2387202	2387702	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2406272	2406973	and DarkSakura.
2429875	2436537	The basic idea is that this giant computer, get this, you'll never have seen this coming, has taken over the galaxy.
2436777	2437277	Who knows?
2437697	2438337	Yeah, I know.
2438918	2442759	And the irony is that humanity created the giant computer.
2442839	2444739	So if you haven't beaten the game, sorry about that.
2444759	2445880	That was a big spoiler.
2446300	2453922	And so they dispatch you to go in there with your ship, one ship, and annihilate like jillions of enemies and wipe them all out.
2454827	2462212	The levels scroll every which way, the backgrounds move, you face ships that make the giant ship in R-Type look like a tinker toy.
2462272	2462813	Giant flowers.
2464094	2466075	Yeah, yeah, you shoot some giant flowers too.
2466435	2467396	Robot fish.
2468517	2469797	Just, it's awesome.
2469978	2472219	It's really hard to describe how great this game is.
2472459	2478964	If you can throw down an emulator or if you have a Sega Genesis, like I'm sure some of you do, you really need to play this game.
2480970	2481971	What else should I say about it?
2481991	2483732	What else should I say about it?
2505031	2508614	I remember you trying to play this on the Nomad and yelling at it.
2528012	2528613	Thanks for watching!
2546820	2549282	And when you die, you lose the weapon that you collected.
2549742	2553304	And it's not as big a disaster as it is in, like, Gradius when you die.
2553504	2554945	You know, you don't start from zero.
2555365	2564771	But if you really like the hunter or wave weapons and you get hit and lose them, then you have to, you know, soldier through without them until you get another wave weapon.
2565171	2566212	This level pisses me off.
2566232	2569394	You guys should be able to see this because this level is totally sweet.
2569798	2575602	Well, how about if someone reminds me, I will repost it to our Tumblr.
2575862	2576222	Your thing.
2576242	2577023	I'll put it on our Tumblr.
2577203	2577863	You'll tumble it.
2578063	2578423	I'll tumble.
2578443	2590591	Like they're flying through the first level of Castlevania X. Yeah, except for like this game came out like four years before Castlevania Dracula XX, the Rondo of Blood.
2592066	2594747	It's pretty cool though, but yeah, I completely suck at this game.
2594807	2595287	I'll admit it.
2595587	2595887	I've tried.
2596107	2597528	It's really not that hard.
2597548	2599949	There's way, way more difficult cheaters.
2600669	2604090	I can definitely one-credit it, if not one-life it.
2604950	2607251	Yeah, I think our type is harder.
2607839	2610960	Oh, our type is blisteringly difficult compared to Thunder Force.
2611260	2617101	Like, the first time you play Thunder Force 3, you think, oh, it's fast and difficult, but the weapons are awesome.
2617141	2620842	When you get a powered-up ship, if you're not really lame, you know, it's hard to die.
2621003	2623103	Our type, it's just really easy to die.
2623643	2623883	Yeah.
2624223	2626304	The difference is our type is like a thinking man shooter.
2626364	2631725	It's slow, and it's all about positioning the ship and, you know, handling the obstacles correctly.
2632045	2634006	Thunder Force is much more of a twitch shooter.
2634497	2635458	Yeah, I see that.
2635578	2640544	Alright, well, how about some boss music before we go to break?
2640965	2641426	I don't care.
2641626	2642267	Play whatever you want.
2644449	2645831	Shoot, shoot, bang, bang.
2646031	2647473	Pew, pew, pew, pew.
2647533	2647853	Lasers.
2649996	2652779	And that is our classic game of the week.
2652919	2653961	My classic game of the week.
2654451	2679703	Thunder Force 3 on Genesis slash Mega Drive slash Genesis it was on the Genesis and the SNES and the Arcade and you could also play it on the Saturn yeah all that too alright well guess what that's the end of part A and I'm going to do the ritual saving of part A now so stay tuned I will keep you occupied with Mega Man music this is the part where we sacrifice a goat
2680825	2681206	No!
2681426	2683329	Well, as long as we get to make some curry out of it later.
2683770	2684551	Take that, goat!
2685393	2688498	Okay, everyone, stay tuned.
2695159	2697120	And we are back from our break.
2697160	2698420	Thank you for sticking with us.
2698460	2700981	This is, of course, Orange Lounge Radio.
2701801	2706443	And as I said before at the beginning of Part A, Rob is gone.
2706783	2707583	He's at Disneyland.
2707763	2710824	We locked him in the firehouse in Walt's bedroom.
2711364	2712225	And we've taken over.
2712585	2718927	So it is me tonight, DarkSakura, Loki, and that dude that I picked up on the internet, Dan.
2719087	2720747	The notorious D-A-N.
2722508	2723028	What what?
2724076	2724396	What?
2724837	2725097	What?
2727679	2728079	Hearts.
2728660	2728820	Hi.
2729240	2729440	Hi.
2729901	2730581	Yeah, that's Dan.
2730621	2731102	I married him.
2731122	2731802	I get to live with that.
2732743	2733183	I love you.
2734044	2734284	Anyway.
2734304	2734685	Oh, sure.
2735065	2735665	Yeah, sure.
2736166	2738828	So how about we just go ahead and get into Rapid Fire News?
2739212	2740253	Dazzling Darling by HHH
2761633	2777666	Also the Dazzlin' Darlin' AKBK Mix Remix by DJ Command Whoever the hell that is Drop by DJ Taka featuring Kanako Hoshino Firefire by Stripe That's an awesome name, Firefire
2778386	2807506	Firefire, Gold Rush by DJ Yoshitaka-G featuring Michael Alamode, May by Amuro vs. Killer, Second Heaven by Ryu Star, She is My Wife by Superstar Mitsuru, Smooch by Kors K, Vanessa by Suzaku,
2808586	2829220	and Yellow Candy by Risk Junk and Zeta the I love the name of this one Zeta the world of prime numbers and transcendental being by Zetbok and I'm very surprised to see actually a lot of Japanese tracks in Dance Dance Revolution 2 I mean it
2830612	2834735	I might actually have to check that out, I mean, with all the songs that they're putting in there.
2834915	2837077	It's amazing, considering it's from Japan.
2837737	2839478	But they don't always get licenses.
2839918	2845803	These games, they're coming out, they usually tend to put a lot of licensed stuff and weird old shit.
2847844	2848745	But it's very surprising.
2849985	2851827	Also... Does it have Boom Boom Dollar?
2853008	2854869	I don't know, I haven't looked at the other ones.
2855069	2856330	If it doesn't, then fuck it.
2858303	2861886	Then, of course, also, Dance Dance Revolution X2 Max.
2862126	2866330	They've got the unlocked code, which is unintentionally released, apparently.
2867888	2868469	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft
2893311	2918488	Dazzlin' Darlin', the AKBK mix, remixed by DJ Command, also from Dance Dance Revolution 2 there If You Were Here, the LEDG style remix by Jennifer Kimono Princess by Jun Looks like Roppongi Evolved by Tag Underground Antimatter by Orbit1 and Milo
2919468	2943504	New Decay by Soda F, Possession by Tag Underground, Valkyrie Dimension by Spriggan, May by Omoro vs. the Killer, Pluto the First by Whitewall, and also the weirdly titled Zeta, The World of Prime Numbers and Transcendental Beings by Zetbok, and Vanessa by Suzaku.
2944304	2948267	Something called Valkyrie Dimension by Spriggan actually just sounds kind of cool.
2949974	2951455	I was going to say, what, no dropout?
2951515	2955216	But now I'm just wanting to see what Valkyrie Dimension by Spriggan is.
2956717	2957517	Yeah, lots of cool songs.
2957877	2963160	And, of course, based on the last list we just read there, a lot of these are going to be featured in Dance Dance Revolution, too.
2963300	2966061	So it might be worth checking out.
2966241	2968062	And, I mean, let's just put it this way.
2968162	2972643	If you don't check it out right away, I can guarantee that the game will probably price drop pretty quick anyways.
2972784	2975185	And it's actually not that expensive going into it.
2975545	2975725	So...
2976565	2978447	You know, it might not hurt to check it out.
2978868	2984394	After all these bundles nowadays on the Wii, like the same price as a PlayStation 2 DDR game back in the day.
2984474	2989780	So, you know, 50 bucks will get you a dance pad for the Wii and the game.
2990100	2994745	Zether pointed out that Soda Fujimori also did an awesome Gradius Trance mix.
2996327	2996487	Yeah.
2997188	2999550	Step Up Evolution's Kyle Ward and Chris Foy
3020068	3022809	Um, it is now heading to the arcades.
3023329	3033272	And, uh, in fact, the original design, and you can actually see this in the YouTube video that they first put up, um, actually did call for some sort of, like, dance mat control type thing.
3034152	3046376	Um, not sure if that's actually gonna be included with it, but it's gonna include a 42-inch multiplayer touchscreen, um, with a global interactive, uh, ranking network, according to the press release.
3047056	3047556	And, um,
3048939	3054122	It'd be interesting to see if that actually is going to include the dance pad or whatever stage.
3055123	3057044	But it is coming to arcades rather soon.
3057224	3067930	Also, Song Pack 15 is out on iOS, including Pegasus by When Machines Dream and also Rock Robotic by When Dreams Machine.
3068451	3069592	Or When Machines Dream.
3069952	3070792	When Dreams Machine.
3072974	3073774	But those are coming out.
3073894	3075935	Actually, you can get those right now on the iOS.
3075995	3077116	Wow, 15 song packs.
3077536	3079337	That's just ridiculous.
3079377	3084981	That's a lot more than Konami ever did on any of their Dance Dance Revolution mixes recently.
3087242	3087542	Alas.
3088623	3088803	Yeah.
3089423	3091364	Well, how about something that has nothing to do with DDR?
3092205	3097348	So, remember back in 2008, Ubisoft announced that they were going to make a game called I Am Alive.
3098049	3098590	Thank you for watching!
3114062	3115463	Yeah, that game isn't dead.
3115983	3118444	They're actually just about to release it.
3118484	3119764	It's going to come out this winter.
3120404	3120664	Really?
3121365	3121725	Really.
3122245	3123045	Wow, you don't say.
3123425	3125426	I was amazed when I saw the story.
3125506	3126646	I was like, really?
3127107	3129067	Isn't this like three or four years old?
3129347	3132208	I thought that it was, for some reason I remember that being like a PS1 game.
3132629	3133609	It's not even that old.
3133629	3135710	I mean, it was probably a couple years ago.
3135810	3135990	It was 2008.
3136050	3136330	Really?
3136350	3136570	I thought.
3139972	3147381	I thought it was 09 because I thought that originally it was supposed to be coming out in March and then it got pushed back again.
3148603	3150365	But maybe that's March of last year.
3150385	3156774	I just remember that every time they started talking about that game, there was some sort of catastrophe in the world and they were like, oh...
3157114	3157874	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3173021	3175462	and just, it's been backburnered this whole time.
3175602	3184766	So, if you really want to play like a three and a half year old survival horror game, because you know how great that's going to be, watch for it to be hitting shelves before Christmas.
3185167	3187608	Actually, not shelves at all.
3188108	3188908	Oh, is it a download?
3189088	3190069	It's going to be a downloadable game.
3190089	3192370	Download it off the internet before Christmas.
3192390	3197012	But see, that's great though, because it's not going to be like, you know, 50 bucks or 30 bucks.
3197072	3197612	It's going to be 15.
3198053	3199593	I can deal with 15.
3199633	3199653	I...
3201877	3202177	Okay.
3202938	3204259	They should just give it away at this point.
3204479	3204719	Really?
3204759	3205639	Yes, I agree.
3205679	3206520	Free would be perfect.
3206560	3209221	They'd probably sell a few copies.
3210982	3211782	It might be awesome.
3211882	3213743	You know, I'll reserve judgment on this awesomeness.
3213763	3215204	You know what they need to do because it's Ubisoft?
3216025	3217465	The cause of the disaster was the Rabbids.
3217485	3218386	Release Beyond Good and Evil 2?
3228068	3247692	I thought that was actually supposed to be a series that was like a primetime like comedy series with the Rabbids but they haven't done it yet they're kind of you know a one joke character who cares there's a lot of one joke characters that still have like movie after movie after movie
3249415	3249736	Yeah?
3250636	3258439	I mean, you know, if you're talking about, like, well, let's see, any of the dog movies that they have, like, was it Beethoven that they made?
3258459	3261541	Yeah, that's true, because they keep making fucking penguin movies.
3262141	3263021	Penguins, yes.
3263181	3264722	It's like, oh, dear God.
3264922	3267543	Disclaimer, this was supposed to be rapid-fire news, everybody.
3267703	3267923	Okay.
3269464	3269904	Shut up.
3270425	3271585	Hey, you shut up.
3271725	3272506	I'm the boss tonight.
3272786	3273126	No, you're not.
3273326	3276688	To rapid fire on to the next news story.
3276728	3277049	Yeah.
3277349	3278349	You like rock band?
3278650	3279770	You like Limp Bizkit?
3280391	3282092	Oh, nobody likes Limp Bizkit.
3282532	3291497	Well, if you want to spend $10, you can get, I guess $7 if you want to do it as a package, you can get four Limp Bizkit songs in your rock band.
3291837	3296040	Gold Cobra, Nookie, My Way, and Rearranged.
3296380	3300931	Plus, they're going to get you for an extra buck if you want pro guitar or bass.
3301993	3303096	Goody, goody gumdrops.
3305619	3310685	In some actually valuable news, the PS3 plays Blu-rays, plays games.
3311646	3312166	It's okay.
3312487	3317051	Wait, it's going to validate its existence because now you can get Chrono Trigger on PSN.
3317652	3319734	There's nothing wrong with another version of Chrono Trigger.
3319834	3324199	I can't think of one bad thing about being able to get Chrono Trigger on the PS3.
3324539	3327663	They could charge $50 for it and it would still be worth the money.
3328203	3332866	I ain't saying you should spend 50 bucks on Chrono Trigger, but if you did, I wouldn't be like, you're high.
3332966	3334247	I'd be like, high five.
3334447	3335567	Chrono Trigger kicks ass.
3336448	3338129	We should actually play our SNES one again.
3339310	3339650	Yes.
3340350	3340570	Yes.
3341251	3342672	Well, here's some news.
3342692	3348895	This is kind of no one curve, but Harvest Moon is going to have a partner with a farm.
3349596	3351217	It's actually the Surrey Docks Farm.
3352834	3360962	So they're basically going to actually link the virtual environment to the real Surrey Docs farm.
3361483	3367669	So it's official and that's coming from Gary Jones who is the farm manager there.
3368549	3397518	he said we got along really well with the team and were very impressed with the Harvest Moon games since then we stayed in touch and will be looking to work together on future titles so they are merging real farming with virtual farming so when you go to milk your cute little cow somebody is going to be milking a not so cute little but cute cow I guess so yeah farm twinning and when they run into that tainted beef you will also get that tainted beef
3399310	3411239	and Frozen Synapse is a, has a new, you know, I would like to be able to speak English without going bleh.
3411839	3412820	Shut up.
3412860	3413600	You are not the count.
3414941	3415882	One, one mistake.
3418220	3421643	Frozen Synapse is going to star in a new Humble Indie Bundle.
3422244	3423005	Yay!
3423185	3425207	We know what the Humble Indie Bundle is, don't we, Dan?
3425567	3426849	I have no idea what you're talking about.
3427149	3430753	That where you pay what you want and the money gets donated.
3431013	3432154	I remember reading about that.
3432214	3435858	Didn't like the first time they did that like 70% of the people just stole the game anyway?
3437111	3438232	No, I don't think so.
3438272	3439954	I think they can pay a lot of money off of it.
3440575	3443959	And it's all gone to good causes.
3444019	3448724	So anyway, Frozen Synapse is going to be included in the bundle.
3449525	3453450	And if you pay more than the average price, which is more than $4.27...
3455752	3464856	You also can get Humble Frozen Byte Bundle, which actually includes Trine, Shadowground, Shadowground Survivor, and the cancelled Jackclaw prototype.
3465536	3467137	And pre-order the coming Splat.
3468658	3472960	The money will go to Child's Play and the Electronic Frontier Foundation as you choose.
3473840	3474500	So pretty cool, huh?
3475601	3475921	Pretty cool.
3476463	3480587	and also Frozen Synapse is included on Linux.
3480767	3481427	So that's pretty neat.
3481808	3483689	And last but never least, Persona 4!
3483749	3490715	For all you people who like that weird game, there's going to be an anime version that's coming out in the US.
3492036	3498221	And it is going to be released in North America and have digital distribution.
3498821	3503926	The DVD and Blu-ray version are going to be out next year and it premieres in Japan on October 6th.
3504406	3511770	No, I was completely unaware until I was actually doing a search for, I was looking up an item for the new Professor Layton game coming out.
3512390	3516092	And the Professor Layton anime movie is actually coming out over here in November.
3516473	3516713	Really?
3516873	3517113	That's cool.
3517133	3517913	Which is kind of interesting.
3518374	3527298	Well, something that fans of the series should be interested in too is it's actually got the same art director and the composer, Shigenori Soejima and Shouji Meguro.
3527579	3528259	So, pretty cool.
3529110	3533034	Have you seen that Konami has like a really blatant ripoff of Professor Layton?
3533634	3537818	Yes, Dr. Loric and the something or other, I don't remember what it was.
3538218	3538919	I'm going to try to find it.
3539119	3547567	When I first saw it, I was really excited because I thought it was a sequel to that Dr. Lortrek, whatever.
3547867	3549368	I thought it was a sequel to that...
3550989	3551410	What was it called?
3551430	3552670	It was like Henry Hatsworth.
3552870	3553511	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3553531	3556392	It was like a side-scrolling game that, you know, I played it in the store.
3556432	3559553	The guys, everyone was playing it in the store and they were just like, you gotta try this game when I try this game.
3559593	3560834	Your copy is sitting over there on my desk.
3560854	3562655	I was like, this game is fucking amazing.
3563595	3570038	And I saw that and I saw this Professor of Lautrec and I was like, oh my god, is it a sequel to that?
3570198	3571979	No, no, it's a Professor Layton rip-off.
3571999	3573219	A really obvious one, too.
3573259	3576841	Like, the guy looks like if he walked up to Professor Layton they would just be like, what up?
3576901	3577561	Hey, what's going on?
3577581	3579462	And the guy would like twirl his mustache because he's evil.
3581311	3582072	Fuckin' Konami.
3584274	3586217	Remember when they made, like, cool original games?
3586897	3587158	No.
3588259	3591603	Didn't they make Frogger one time?
3592003	3592864	They made Frogger.
3593144	3594046	They made Gradius.
3595067	3596749	They made Castle Freakin'vania.
3596969	3597790	Castlevania.
3598110	3598851	What the hell, okay?
3600233	3601894	Let's do another Frogger game for the 3DS.
3602714	3603374	Whoa, hold on.
3604094	3605875	Why are you doing Frogger for the 3DS first?
3606035	3608115	Gradius for the 3DS would be perfect.
3608696	3611056	Dude, they should do Solar Assault for the 3DS.
3611516	3613657	Solar Assault was a 3D Gradius.
3614597	3615997	How about YY Konami World?
3617118	3617378	Why?
3618658	3619878	Why, why?
3620519	3621899	Konami's YY Racing.
3624280	3625060	That game was awesome.
3625240	3625460	I know.
3626640	3627480	I don't know.
3628381	3629601	Was that supposed to be the next story anyway?
3630954	3632716	I think that was actually Loki's turn.
3633537	3633917	I'm ready.
3635158	3637360	So let's talk a little bit about Nielsen ratings.
3639322	3640123	I don't agree with them.
3640943	3648510	In fact, they have tapped what they call the top 10 anticipated games for 2011, for the fourth quarter.
3654095	3656697	I'm sorry, but there's a few things missing and a few things I don't agree on.
3656737	3660320	So let's go down the list real quick and I can point that stuff out.
3660680	3664723	Of course, not very obvious, I'm sure.
3665163	3667024	Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 is number one.
3667584	3668145	That makes sense.
3668285	3670847	It's going to be probably the biggest title this year.
3672528	3676330	Number two, and actually this is the top 20 to watch for the holiday 2011.
3676370	3676611	Gears of War 3.
3679841	3681403	Madden NFL 12 Assassin's Creed Revelations
3696665	3699647	Also kind of a no-brainer, you know, kind of expect that to do pretty well.
3700067	3702068	Batman Arkham City, I could see that.
3703649	3707131	The Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword, yeah, that makes sense.
3708331	3711733	Battlefield 3, of course, it's going to be a pretty big title.
3712954	3716756	Just Dance 3, yeah, on the Wii perhaps, I could see that.
3717896	3718296	NBA 2K12
3720774	3727679	Need for Speed, The Run, Uncharted 3, Mario & Sonic at the London 2012 Olympic Games, Lego Harry Potter Years 5-7, FIFA Soccer 12, The Elder Scrolls Skyrim,
3747632	3749953	That I would see doing a lot better than what they're saying.
3750393	3752234	Dead Island did really well.
3752534	3754854	I could see that maybe being a little higher up the list.
3755255	3756875	Kinect Sports Season 2.
3757595	3758756	Now this is where I've got to stop them.
3759236	3762977	Yeah, the first one did well, but I don't think the second one is going to sell that well at all.
3763757	3766098	Also, they have Dance Central 2 on the list.
3766338	3771160	Yes, I would hope that the second game will do just as well as the first game, but...
3772768	3784479	I don't think that it's going to Resistance 3, that's a pretty good first party title for Sony and finally, Deus Ex Human Revolution Where the fuck is Saints Row the 3rd on this list?
3784739	3798612	That game is going to do immensely well but it's just sadly missing or there's a bunch of other games that could be on this list that they're completely overlooking No one cares about the Nielsen's anyway
3799349	3801330	Yeah, I mean, they're just guessing what's going to be in the top five.
3801350	3804473	Nilsons don't even want to acknowledge that Saints Row the Third is going to exist.
3805153	3805954	Let's be honest, though.
3805974	3807055	Stick to TV, Nilsons.
3807255	3809056	Where the fuck is Grand Theft Auto V?
3810377	3812058	It's not coming out for a while.
3812358	3812919	Yeah, I know.
3814480	3818503	I mean, I want to play Saints Row the Third because I want to play Grand Theft Auto V. I just...
3820155	3823317	Well, Grand Theft Auto V will probably be out by about a year's time.
3823397	3828019	I mean, because they've already got their first half of 2012 already kind of spoken for.
3828520	3838224	With Max Payne 3 and XCOM, I believe, are going to be the two games that... Well, no, actually XCOM is 2K, but not Rockstar.
3838285	3840966	But Max Payne 3, I know, is their spring title.
3842907	3844248	You've seen the trailer for Max Payne 3.
3844709	3847391	It started off and I was really stoked because he had hair.
3848252	3852775	And then he shaved his head and I was like, God damn it, Max Payne looks stupid bald.
3855017	3856518	It just really bothers me.
3856718	3859360	Is it just because he didn't want to render hair or something like that?
3859380	3861342	It's like when Snake was old in Metal Gear Solid 4.
3862423	3863583	That just pissed me off.
3863864	3866906	But then they made it so I could make him look young and I liked playing with him again.
3867226	3869308	I hate it when they make my game heroes look stupid.
3869963	3871908	He did have the Burt Reynolds stache.
3872209	3873371	Oh, the Burt Reynolds stache was cool.
3876810	3892103	but yeah I mean they've got Max Payne 3 I know is coming and Agent is supposed to be the other thing they're working on right now but Agent got cancelled like a long time ago like I am alive ago yeah but L.A.
3892163	3903473	Noire that was also thought to be cancelled for a long time and it eventually came out Grand Theft Auto 5 I could see probably fourth quarter next year Agent could make me wait for Grand Theft Auto 5 if it's good
3904284	3907051	I'm really excited about the possibility of Agent being good.
3908018	3936962	LA Noire was awesome Red Dead Redemption was awesome you know if they keep bringing me other games to keep me busy I could like wait for GTA 5 but it's like seriously I've been dying just to go back and replay The Lost and Damned they don't understand how easy it is for them to in the meantime do something look at this trend that's going on right now with all these HD remakes of older games just take Grand Theft Auto 3 San Andreas San Andreas especially San Andreas
3938617	3941700	Give it some HD graphics, add multiplayer, boom!
3941940	3943901	Who gives a shit about Grand Theft Auto V for a while?
3943981	3947804	I would pay for those two games just to be imported into the Grand Theft Auto IV engine.
3948993	3974376	and they've done that and that's all they would have to do but I mean commercially not as a mod but commercially if they did those games in Grand Theft Auto 4 style I would like I would pay full price for the remakes I would you have a mod team of like maybe 5 people that did it in a couple months what's gonna happen when you have Rockstar that has the fucking tools to make these games they have all the assets to make these games
3975498	3978361	How long is it going to take a team of 30 people?
3978701	3980502	It's like printing fucking money.
3981303	3983705	It's like making your own money for God's sakes.
3983765	3984726	Just release them.
3985527	3987829	Give them to me and I will give you my money.
3990773	3991773	It wouldn't take that much.
3991913	3994275	And seriously, they could just piggyback it on the Rage Engine.
3994775	3996036	Don't even have to really tweak anything.
3996076	3999759	Just piggyback it on what it is now, and people would eat that shit.
3999939	4001260	You're talking like Game of the Year shit.
4001280	4012388	Getting to the point where these games, I mean, not that it's ever going to be irrelevant in the video game world, but GTA is kind of losing its relevance because Call of Duty has taken over so big.
4013288	4026175	and and people are playing other things and you haven't heard from Grand Theft Auto which was at one time the dominator of the game world and it's just like where is it at god damn it
4028311	4028771	I can't wait.
4029192	4029812	Me either.
4029872	4031213	It's starting to piss me off.
4031233	4033975	I could absolutely see them do an HD San Andreas.
4034096	4034896	And it would make sense.
4034996	4037518	It would be amazing just to do that.
4037638	4040240	Because it's great, but it's really hard for me to go backwards.
4040601	4042462	Like, I had a hard time going back.
4042482	4049468	I mean, I played through San Andreas after I played through GTA 4 while I was waiting for the episodes from Liberty City Pack.
4049688	4050949	And then I was like, well, screw this.
4051209	4053090	I'll go back now and I'll play Vice City.
4053250	4054151	And I couldn't do it.
4054572	4056233	It's just too funky.
4058467	4062651	The old Grand Theft Auto games were great games for their moment, but now they don't look very good.
4062671	4063972	They don't control very good.
4064432	4069877	Other than using cheat codes and running around and just doing messed up stuff, they're not really cool.
4070077	4075042	But you can still go back and play GTA 4 because GTA 4's got a really good physics engine.
4075062	4080346	The driving controls are... It's more fun to run around in.
4080546	4083309	But there's just not as much shit to do as there was in San Andreas.
4083489	4083649	Yeah.
4085711	4087652	GTA V. It's like printing money.
4088952	4089212	Is it?
4089692	4089872	Yes.
4090733	4092533	Okay, I believe you, sort of.
4094774	4095194	Is there more?
4097535	4099335	Battlefield 3, that's almost like printing money.
4099876	4100236	Huh, Dan?
4100936	4101676	Oh yeah, is that my story?
4102316	4102536	Yes.
4102636	4103457	Yay, Battlefield 3!
4104608	4108691	Yeah, speaking of printing money, man, everyone is losing their minds for Battlefield 3.
4109672	4112754	Honestly, I'm not even following games that close and I keep hearing about it.
4113595	4125624	Well, apparently EA, in addition to just paying an assload of money to once again take a shot at knocking off Call of Duty, has decided that it's going to have a Battlefield 3 worldwide conquest tournament in early 2012 with $1.6 million in prizes.
4131741	4133042	Thanks for watching!
4150865	4154609	I always want to check out the battlefields, but they never hook me, honestly.
4154649	4160415	I mean, I hate to admit this, but I've played through the first two Modern Warfares, and I want to play through the third Modern Warfare.
4160756	4171267	I just don't want to pay for it, because I think Activision needs to be beat to death with a bag of rocks for how hard they fucked Infinity Ward.
4171807	4172087	So...
4173817	4174277	I don't know.
4174397	4176719	I'm caught between a rock and a hard place.
4176739	4178360	I'd rather give Microsoft my money.
4178920	4181021	So buy that Halo remake.
4181881	4182882	So we'll see what happens.
4182962	4185463	I'm sure I'll get my hands on it somehow.
4186944	4187505	Possibly.
4188305	4188745	We'll see.
4189145	4195509	Anyways, if you kick ass at Battlefield 3, enter this tournament, win some money, and hook me up for money, you know about it.
4196809	4198971	Well, how about some frivolous lawsuits, huh?
4199352	4199852	And how?
4200833	4218350	Ultimate Pointer has filed patent lawsuits against Nintendo and a damn near bunch of everybody else for its, and I quote, easy deployable interactive direct-to-pointing system and presentation control system and calibration method, therefore.
4218891	4219752	I call it my finger.
4222738	4248852	but they filed their patent in May of 2005 although it didn't receive an official status until June 2010 which is four years after the Wii came out in the US anyway and they're also suing basically everyone that works with the Wii like anyone who's done games for the Wii in fact it's included retailers who are also involved too in making, using, importing and or selling of Wii systems, games and related accessories
4249693	4251617	Also called the Accused Products.
4252659	4253541	This will get thrown out.
4253722	4255806	Yeah, this is going to get completely pissed on by...
4256394	4257294	Amazon would just squash them.
4285144	4296635	Like Nintendo won't Oh, QVC, I mean, even But they're asking that Nintendo of America pay a reasonable royalty due to the alleged infringement Isn't QVC the home shopping channel?
4296675	4299998	Yes, it is You ever see the video where the guy was washing the windows and he fell off the ladder?
4301259	4303421	I saw the one where the guy broke a TV with the Wiimote
4303735	4304436	That's a good one too.
4305156	4305356	Yeah.
4305716	4312941	Watch the QVC video where the guy, he's like up in the background demonstrating like this ladder and he just falls right off it.
4313302	4314202	It's awesome.
4315163	4317565	People hurting themselves on QVC is cool.
4320687	4321908	I'm glad you think so.
4322628	4325350	Well, how about some FUs of the week, huh?
4325670	4327392	Because I think that we're angsty people.
4344760	4348641	My FU of the week goes towards hotels near Disneyland for not being cheaper.
4351502	4351822	Loki?
4353342	4360383	FU goes to the stupid woman at Subway who doesn't understand how to put together a payment properly.
4361344	4362724	Or take instructions.
4363884	4364404	Or turkey.
4364784	4368665	Or give you a cup with Uncharted 3 demo on it.
4370168	4371649	I want to F you to Ultimate Pointer.
4372129	4372949	Fuck those guys.
4373470	4374270	Fuck them right in the ear.
4375491	4376371	Yeah, fuck them.
4377471	4380073	Okay, we really got our angst up quickly, didn't we?
4382914	4386976	I guess we're all not all that pissed because we don't have Rob's soothing voice here to keep us happy, huh?
4387536	4388757	Fuck Rob for that.
4389917	4390258	You know what?
4390278	4391098	Fuck that guy.
4392058	4392979	You like Rob.
4393860	4396281	and fuck the people who keep making Penguin movies too.
4397001	4398042	God damn.
4398362	4407606	I was at the movie theater the other day and I mean I was there to see the Lion King 3D so you'd expect that I'm going to see this but I saw the commercial for Happy Feet 2 fucking twice and once was enough.
4408027	4408807	Dear God.
4409127	4410648	Did it really need a sequel?
4412129	4413389	Fuck Penguin movies.
4414009	4415170	So do we have any more news Loki?
4415643	4416124	There's this new...
4435183	4435964	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4452160	4459503	Um, of course, you know, they've got a few people in there that, you know, they're claiming, oh, I love games and stuff like that.
4459804	4465766	But then they've got actually some hardcore people that have, you know, Zelda tattoos and button tattoos and all crazy shit like that.
4466146	4474230	Which is a little bit more believable, but like, you know, rather than the, I remember one time my boyfriend played a game and it was just fun.
4474810	4475811	Anyways, um...
4476491	4482335	So yeah, if you're interested, it is coming out quite soon from New Sensations.
4483496	4486057	And it's Geek Girls the Gamers.
4487959	4491621	Yes, if that's not ridiculous enough like the Playboy spreads that they do.
4492362	4500727	But this at least has actual people in it instead of, you know, Photoshop, CG, fake characters that are topless.
4502168	4502788	Kids like boobs.
4504269	4505250	Especially nursing children.
4509000	4510240	Remember BMX XXX?
4511441	4520005	Yes That game was awesomely bad It was awesomely bad It was like Dave Mirab Freestyle BMX 2 but you could be naked
4520543	4539707	but no it was an awesome game because not necessarily because of that because of all the missions that they would give you like you would have to it's like ridiculous shit like okay you're gonna have to pull off some tricks to get this dog horny so they'll go fuck another dog that's literally one of the missions in the first level of the game that is like one of like the first missions
4539907	4545832	And then another one where you have to deliver hose to their clients using your bike.
4545872	4546673	On the back of your bike.
4546713	4547473	I remember that one.
4547493	4548915	On the back of your BMX bike.
4549215	4550196	You know what was great about that?
4550256	4554459	Just go to the cheat code, enter Champagne Room, and then you can watch all the titty videos.
4555300	4555961	It's that simple.
4556321	4556941	There you go.
4557422	4561185	And then you can go play Matt Hoffman because Matt Hoffman was just a better game.
4562150	4562730	I like that game.
4562851	4563751	I thought it was pretty good.
4564112	4569436	It was ironic though that the PlayStation 2 and GameCube versions were uncensored.
4570036	4572938	Or it was like the Xbox and GameCube versions were uncensored.
4573599	4575060	I don't know about the GameCube version.
4575120	4578022	I know that they gave me an Xbox version.
4578363	4580845	The GameCube one was uncensored because that's what I had it on.
4582079	4611097	and like didn't some like girl family sue after the fact cause she was under no that was Dave Mira sued no that was the um that was the Girls Gone Wild the guy game oh that was it yeah I don't even remember being sued it was just that some underage girl managed to sneak into it and then they were like you can't sell that game anymore I'm like that's fine we weren't selling it to start with so one more story and then we're gonna open up the skyplane sounds good oh sure
4612358	4618222	So apparently, Microsoft is looking into auto-mature filtering options.
4618943	4621365	I don't really understand what I'm reading here.
4621705	4626408	I guess they did it a while ago where you can go ahead and set the games up so they won't be quite as mature.
4626889	4629450	Which I think, honestly, is a pretty decent idea.
4629791	4634814	Because, you know, you really want to make Gears of War a little warmer and more cuddly so your 8-year-old can play it.
4635435	4635775	Really?
4637096	4638757	They ought to make that game two ways.
4639357	4641339	Violent and ultra-violent.
4643533	4648756	Now, this is not part of a show role, but did you notice there was a story this week?
4648836	4653618	Someone had actually built a full-size Lancer out of Legos.
4653839	4654819	It's like, really?
4655499	4656760	That dude is my hero.
4658001	4658681	And it works.
4658841	4660622	We were a two-Lancer family at one time.
4661122	4663464	No, no, not Mitsubishi Lancer, you dork.
4664784	4666145	It's the gun from Gears of War.
4666225	4669567	I know, I was being silly.
4671127	4674369	I'm opening the skyline now because I'm tired of listening to Dan.
4675810	4676531	You live with me.
4676551	4678352	You have to listen to me all the time.
4678432	4679773	I could just go back to Rob's house.
4680113	4681954	Go to Rob's house.
4682175	4684016	They were talking about Road Rash real quick.
4684156	4684456	Yeah.
4684596	4687899	That was one of those games that, remember, it was the Burnout Team.
4687959	4690200	Criterion, I think, was actually going to put out a new version.
4690220	4691181	Oh, my God.
4691241	4692502	That would be amazing.
4692522	4694383	The video was fucking amazing.
4694403	4695624	You say they were going to or they are going to?
4695804	4696504	They were going to.
4696524	4697105	It got canceled.
4697165	4698546	Why would they not do that?
4698786	4699567	They work for EA.
4699607	4699767	Yeah.
4700748	4701509	This needs to happen.
4701529	4703212	Does anybody know someone at EA?
4703833	4704073	Yes.
4704434	4705135	For the record.
4705175	4707018	It's like, don't have a make more need for speeds.
4707078	4709622	For God's sakes, have Criterion make a road rush.
4709883	4710844	In fact, fuck that noise.
4711105	4713348	Why isn't Criterion making a new Burnout?
4714321	4715802	So the skyline is open.
4715922	4719104	Dude, I need to get that.
4719124	4723227	1-877-GAME-OLR or see us on Skype at Orange Lounge Radio.
4723587	4724668	Because we're awesome.
4724848	4725889	You can see us on Skype.
4726109	4731713	Until then, I'm going to read some of our very, very few tinky Twitter topics.
4732793	4736176	But I don't want to use whatever song that... Oh, we actually have a caller.
4736716	4737697	So I will answer this first.
4738888	4739709	Hey, it's CD Thunder.
4739729	4739829	Okay.
4739849	4739929	Okay.
4761903	4770425	I played the first Contra a little bit, but I just wanted to actually get your guys' opinions on Contra.
4771786	4775907	Contra is if you really hate yourself and want to be defeated at every turn.
4776907	4783029	Yeah, I mean, it was really hard because I couldn't even get past the first level without dying like five or six times.
4783769	4784249	Practice.
4785130	4786390	Contra's not very difficult.
4788194	4791075	Contra is the kind of game that when you know where everything is going to come from, you'll be fine.
4791095	4792395	It's not hard if you know how to play it.
4792695	4793955	I really don't know how.
4794776	4795616	So what was your other topic?
4796696	4797716	Play the Contra on the Super NES.
4799677	4799997	Say what?
4800157	4801137	What was your second topic?
4802097	4805598	Oh, it's about Metal Slug.
4806658	4807419	I love Metal Slug.
4808059	4808899	I like Camel Slug.
4810541	4817646	I saw the Orange Slug Radio YouTube video that showed the inside of your vault.
4818946	4822489	And I noticed they had a copy of Metal Slug Anthology.
4822969	4823389	Yes, we do.
4823930	4824210	Indeed.
4825170	4829473	And a bunch of other different Metal Slugs somewhere on various things.
4829493	4831815	Ironically enough, I own no Metal Slug for the actual Neo Geo.
4831835	4833175	Metal Slug, I really like that.
4833235	4833496	I mean...
4835549	4836890	It's really basic.
4836950	4840492	All you do is you have a character and you go around killing people.
4840652	4843413	I mean, how can it get any more basic?
4844233	4846094	Do you have a copy of Metal Slug Anthology?
4847355	4848175	No, I don't actually.
4848195	4849016	You should get one.
4851897	4852678	It's really epic.
4852818	4855259	It's worth owning if you're a fan of run-and-gun games.
4857079	4861203	Basically all the Contras, all the Metal Slugs are just the best run and gun games you can get.
4862365	4865108	If you go out and buy them and play them, you will be happy.
4865348	4866950	And happiness is what you want, right?
4867650	4869132	Yeah, pretty much.
4869412	4870433	Happiness in game form.
4870493	4872235	Kill all who oppose you.
4873296	4873997	Words to live by.
4874778	4875679	Got anything else for us tonight?
4876345	4878706	Yeah, a couple last minute things.
4879086	4879386	Okay.
4880706	4884507	I'd like to talk about two of my favorite games to play in the arcade.
4884567	4885787	How about one of your favorite games?
4885807	4887388	Because we've got to let other callers come in.
4888188	4888508	Okay.
4889428	4894069	One of my favorite arcade games to play was, I'm not sure if you've heard of this one, it's called CarnEvil.
4894749	4896130	Yes, I know CarnEvil.
4896170	4897030	That game was awful.
4899355	4900216	Why don't you like it?
4900316	4900716	I liked it.
4900756	4901617	Because it was awful.
4901977	4903758	It's a gun game.
4903818	4905098	It wasn't very challenging either.
4905119	4906799	It wasn't a good gun game.
4906879	4908380	And I hate clowns.
4908420	4910101	But I'm glad that you like it.
4910461	4912623	It's very popular.
4912663	4914203	You see those machines everywhere.
4914644	4917645	I think that I hate clowns so much that I didn't even enjoy shooting them.
4918546	4919426	Oh, okay.
4919626	4920627	Yeah, I can understand that.
4921215	4923636	Alright, well thanks for giving us a call today, CD Thunder.
4924217	4925377	Alright, thank you.
4925958	4927639	We all float down here at Georgie.
4927699	4936744	I sent Jamie, real quick, because I know this is going to make amazing radio, that trailer for the new Road Rash game.
4936824	4940686	It's a pre-visual thing that this guy is working on.
4940886	4941066	Dude.
4941226	4944128	Dude.
4946738	4952863	So we have a bike, and the life bar is a chain going to a deformed skull.
4952923	4954164	Dude, that dude kicked a van.
4955325	4955845	Now kick him.
4956125	4956506	Kick him!
4956806	4957486	In the face!
4958167	4959748	Oh, oh, dude, he's grappling him.
4962410	4963871	Oh, you should have pushed him into that car.
4964071	4965813	I would buy, like, five copies of this.
4969956	4970116	Oh!
4970196	4971177	Got told.
4972338	4975040	Oh, you can see that some of the cars are untextured, so, yeah.
4975080	4976301	Well, yeah, it's all pre-biz, so...
4980174	4983935	That's pretty cool.
4983955	4988256	Alright, well hey, we got another caller coming in, so we're going to put this up on our Tumblr.
4988296	4989077	How does that sound?
4989097	4991197	I detect so much hotness.
4994538	4995839	Hello, this is Orange Jones Radio.
4995899	4996259	Who's this?
4996919	4998239	Hey, it's the one and only Ranma.
4998380	5000060	Ranchan, hi.
5000220	5000840	How are you?
5000860	5000940	Good.
5001621	5002141	I'm doing good.
5002161	5002621	How about you?
5003141	5005262	I'm kind of wishing Rob was here.
5005722	5006322	Hmm.
5006966	5010430	Now, before I continue, I have to tell everyone in the chat room, take two drinks.
5011472	5011692	Why?
5013775	5017660	Well, there is a drinking game where everyone has to do like one or two shots when I call in, so.
5018020	5018360	Oh, yeah.
5018481	5019542	Well, we've got apple wine.
5019562	5020043	Does that count?
5021304	5021785	Good enough.
5022065	5022305	Okay.
5022726	5025529	Well, no, I think I've got like some vodka left over from three years ago.
5026614	5031177	I had a bottle of root beer flavored vodka in my cabinet.
5031217	5037661	Went looking for it the other day and it was empty and I realized my other friend who was the local Jack Daniels guy drank it.
5039862	5044545	For the record, we do have that vanilla vodka on top of the fridge that I got for the party and no one ever opened.
5045465	5046566	Like my birthday three years ago.
5046946	5047206	What?
5047226	5047486	Nice.
5047626	5048166	It's still there?
5048466	5048627	Okay.
5048827	5049207	So, hi.
5049227	5050547	So, what's up?
5050627	5051827	I think I drank that when you weren't looking.
5051847	5052548	You don't drink.
5052868	5054548	I drank the shit out of that vodka.
5054608	5055629	You cannot hold your liquor.
5055669	5056529	I was like, clang!
5057089	5063031	He has, if he did one shot, he would be red in the face and sitting on the couch falling asleep.
5063331	5064171	That's not true.
5064211	5065371	That is, okay, two shots.
5065671	5066972	Oh, it probably wouldn't even take one.
5067852	5068132	See?
5068152	5071453	So, Dan's a lush?
5071753	5071953	No.
5071973	5072653	No, Dan's not.
5072693	5073414	Jamie's a lush.
5073434	5074834	Dan's not a very good alcoholic.
5076141	5079084	Well, Jamie, you and Patty would have fun together.
5079904	5083487	I'd like to come out to your neck of the woods and go drinking with you and Patty.
5085209	5087130	That means y'all would be raiding my liquor cabinet.
5087170	5088191	Not that I would be complaining.
5088211	5091014	We'd be contributing to your liquor cabinet and getting you good beer.
5092435	5095397	See, that's why I have parties to get rid of the alcohol.
5095437	5098500	At the end of the night, I open up the cabinet and I'm like, where did all of this come from?
5098837	5100638	Well, that's why for my birthday I have the beer potluck.
5101759	5101859	Ah.
5103280	5106903	So, how about the show so far, huh?
5107643	5108804	So far, so good.
5108964	5111746	I give it three out of four train wrecks.
5112167	5114108	Okay, so we're not a derp-isode fully?
5114728	5115469	We're a minor derp?
5116970	5117931	What are you talking about?
5118691	5119672	That's my podcast.
5119712	5120973	We're the derpy ones.
5121013	5122514	We derail under five minutes.
5123154	5126697	Any show that I appear on for the whole show is immediately awesome.
5127443	5130605	I've just been letting them get out their testosterone-ing, so it's been cool.
5132065	5132625	Fair enough.
5134086	5135107	So what else is on your mind?
5135807	5139369	Well, I think it was last weekend, I believe.
5139569	5141370	It was me, Patty, and Zeeba.
5141410	5146712	We went down to the Jersey Shore, and Zeeba pointed us to a classic arcade.
5147673	5147993	Really?
5148173	5149053	Oh, so cool.
5149213	5151394	So what else did they have at the classic arcade?
5151935	5152635	Were there tons of pins?
5153595	5154236	Super Mario Bros.
5154496	5155237	and Ninja Turtles
5173857	5175138	Yeah, those are both really good.
5199312	5201633	Ninja Turtles, though, got harder when you had more people.
5201973	5202614	It was great.
5202634	5204154	Gauntlet actually got easier.
5204214	5205295	You could last longer.
5207156	5209557	Oh, you got me thinking of Gauntlet 2 for Nintendo.
5209597	5210817	I thought I'd beat that game.
5211098	5213839	After 150 levels, I set the hell with it and walked away.
5214019	5216080	You know, I never got Gauntlet 2 on the NES.
5217026	5238637	and I really wish that I had because it's actually kind of a cool little version I do have Gauntlet 4 for the Genesis which is basically Gauntlet 1 for the Genesis and it's got a quest mode and it's actually four players if you have a multi-tap but I've never managed to get four people on it at once it's one of the failures of my life well I can get you a copy of Gauntlet 2 that's not too hard
5239219	5240760	I don't really need one at this point.
5240981	5241521	I'm just saying.
5241541	5242962	I never picked it up back in the day.
5243442	5246164	And watching videos and stuff of it later on, I kind of wish that I had.
5246445	5248106	Because it looks like it was pretty choice.
5250848	5251468	Indeed it was.
5251488	5253149	I wish I had picked up the strategy guide for it.
5253450	5253750	Oh well.
5254050	5254651	It is what it is.
5255891	5258273	So there were pinball tables there though, right?
5258633	5258854	Yes.
5260075	5264798	One of my friends, Ari, he was playing pinball while I was chucking quarters into a theater of magic machines.
5266054	5268017	Theater Magic is awesome.
5269378	5274584	And then I left that and I went to play this large old school Atari pinball machine.
5276387	5277188	Was it Hercules?
5277668	5278169	Yes, it was.
5278609	5281693	Someone in chat mentioned Hercules.
5281713	5283395	I've never played a Hercules machine.
5283435	5284937	I've seen the back glass for once.
5285894	5292879	It took me five minutes, like five tries to figure out how to play this stupid thing because I'm pulling it back thinking all I gotta do is send it forward.
5292939	5297462	No, I gotta push back and shove it forth like a plunger and send the ball rolling.
5300606	5308228	Well, that sounds like, you know, something just makes me think that I have seen one before, though, at one of the pinball.
5308808	5311349	Didn't they have one at one of the pinball things we went to, Dan?
5312089	5312709	I thought that they did.
5312729	5315110	They didn't have a Hercules, I don't think.
5315310	5316710	No, they just had that giant size old one.
5316730	5317971	It was just a giant mock-up.
5318371	5325693	Yeah, that used a pool cue, a cue ball for the pin, for the pinball.
5328031	5328831	That sounds pretty cool.
5329112	5339254	It was pretty cool, but it got boring after five minutes because I could not reach from one side to the other very easily because of my short arms.
5339494	5342175	How classic was classic?
5342215	5349957	Was it just like that 80s era or did it get into the later 90s or was it just like early 80s to mid 90s?
5350957	5355918	The only machine in this one section that was current was a DDR Max 2 machine.
5356206	5356386	Fragile
5385356	5386616	Well, I'll think about it.
5386816	5389877	Let me wait until the semester's over and then I'll see if I can be shipped.
5391277	5391797	Fair enough.
5392217	5395998	I think Patty would love that because she's about to spaz at her job, so.
5397959	5399099	I've been hearing.
5400279	5401880	Yeah, she's now an assistant manager.
5402480	5403480	I feel very sorry for her.
5405960	5406981	That makes two of us.
5407281	5407541	Yeah.
5408521	5410641	Well, you got anything else for us tonight?
5412362	5412502	Um...
5414597	5415597	Actually, no, that's it.
5415997	5416358	All right.
5417738	5419839	Ranma, before you go, I want you to do something for me.
5420659	5421199	That being?
5421459	5421979	Stay black.
5423920	5424400	No, no, no.
5424480	5425600	I don't stay black anymore.
5425920	5426621	That's not my style.
5426641	5427461	What the fuck did I say?
5427681	5428321	Stay black.
5428701	5430002	No, I stay nerdy, man.
5430182	5430822	Stay nerdy.
5430942	5431422	Stay that too.
5431462	5432382	Keep it nerdy, motherfucker.
5432422	5433022	Keep it nerdy.
5433663	5434023	All right.
5434523	5434803	Okay.
5435123	5436123	Thanks for calling in.
5436503	5436844	All right.
5436944	5437584	Bye, Ronton.
5437864	5438224	Stay black.
5438244	5438344	Bye.
5440279	5442121	Alright, we will take a couple more calls.
5442381	5444724	It's 1-877-GAME-OLR.
5444784	5451691	In the interim, I will go ahead and see what is on our Twitter.
5452112	5457157	We have a mention from Nico Nico-chan.
5457197	5458338	This is tweet heart.
5459619	5462522	Tiger Claw sends us a story about...
5464503	5466184	Dota 2 wants you.
5466345	5466985	Are you ready?
5467345	5474271	And that's a big fan wanting a beta key that they put up a sign.
5474651	5475992	So that's kind of interesting.
5476833	5479295	You paid $3,000 for an electronic billboard.
5479315	5480116	That's pretty crazy.
5480136	5481017	He didn't actually pay $3,000.
5481137	5481937	That's just photoshopped?
5482218	5482658	No, no.
5482758	5487542	What ended up happening is it would have cost him $3,000 to normally rent one of those signs for a month.
5487842	5488183	DarkSakura.com
5504432	5504852	Oh, I see.
5505172	5505873	Well, that's pretty cool.
5506673	5507753	The links people will go to.
5508894	5513075	Guys, we're taking one more call, so that's 1-877-GAME-OLR.
5513395	5519598	We also have another one from Tigerclaw about Gotham City Impostors beta beginning on October 5th.
5521478	5523419	And that's a PC game.
5524019	5524440	Weird.
5525780	5532162	And Steam codes have already been mailed out to those who are accepted, and the client can be downloaded now, but the beta will not begin until next week.
5532483	5533463	So, yay.
5533483	5533563	Okay.
5535117	5535617	Any more calls?
5538360	5539020	They're afraid of you.
5539060	5540462	They're intimidated by your awesomeness.
5543044	5549610	Someone call Dan so I don't have to... Now you should extra call him.
5551151	5552532	Alright, well I'm closing the Skype line.
5555935	5557256	They're intimidated by you, I swear.
5560579	5561660	I'm not intimidated by you.
5564752	5566913	When I roll into the OLR, like, what?
5568594	5569334	Yeah.
5570255	5574217	Well, I guess since that's it, that's pretty much the show.
5574437	5581661	So, how about... And I'm not going to do a fortune cookie tonight either, so... No fortune cookie?
5581861	5582241	No.
5583261	5584802	Because it's a derp-isode and I don't care.
5584822	5588264	You should just play the quartet song again.
5592051	5594112	Okay, I'll play the quartet song again.
5594132	5594572	How's that sound?
5596572	5602494	But because you have all asked for it, I will be doing about 30 minutes to an hour of pump up the volume.
5602554	5604555	So stay tuned after the show.
5604575	5605515	Nobody asked for that.
5605635	5606315	Yes, they did.
5606415	5606795	Shut up.
5606955	5608776	That's like torture on the radio.
5608976	5609716	No, it is not.
5609796	5611176	Everyone thinks it's completely awesome.
5611236	5614397	I can't help it if you are torture on the damn radio.
5616178	5617658	You are punishment.
5617678	5619219	I love you.
5620925	5622666	Rob's back next week, just reminding everybody.
5624007	5625989	I know you guys are excited that Rob will be back.
5626229	5627830	No, I love having you on the show.
5628090	5628550	It's great.
5628651	5629171	It sucks.
5629351	5630992	Wouldn't you guys rather have me here than Jamie?
5631292	5633014	Rob does not suck on the air.
5633174	5634315	He doesn't even really talk.
5634635	5635195	Yes, I do.
5635856	5641320	You have been fucking... I could totally be on the show and you guys would almost not even notice that Jamie was gone.
5643281	5647124	I have to manage... She looks so mad she can barely talk.
5647944	5650226	I wish I would have had a picture of the look on her face a minute ago.
5651647	5653087	Someone has to watch the chat room.
5653587	5662109	And it's usually me, because I'm the only one that can keep all of these rowdy people under some semblance of not kicking each other all over the place with trouts.
5662869	5664229	Dude, all the people are, like, cool.
5664529	5664909	They are cool.
5664929	5666310	They ain't having no problem in there.
5666350	5667510	You're just playing Warcraft.
5668630	5669970	I do not play Warcraft during the show, Dan.
5670130	5671771	That's why the band is going to suck.
5671791	5674911	Actually, I can stream video while you guys do the show.
5675571	5677772	But it was really hard to play Warcraft.
5678052	5678532	You know what?
5678852	5679032	What?
5680054	5680577	End of the show.
5680717	5681320	Bye everybody.
5682345	5682928	Good night.
5683089	5683671	Stay black.
5684853	5687575	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
5716026	5716791	Thanks for watching!
