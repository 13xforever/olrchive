20720	21720	Lies.
21720	36940	And the last of the game is a new section to the PSN Terms of Service.
36940	37940	Orange Lounge Radio.
37940	38940	Hello, welcome to episode 430 of Orange Lounge Radio.
38940	41320	We are awesome.
41320	42520	And Rob's not here.
42520	48980	No, actually we are the show that tells gamers what they really want to know.
48980	50280	And I am your host for tonight.
50280	53320	I am DarkSakura and with us is Loki.
53320	54520	Hi.
54520	61920	And our special guest tonight is some dude that I picked up on the internet, Dan.
61920	62920	I'm a hobo.
62920	63920	Yeah.
63920	71480	Um, so again, it's a Sunday night, six o'clock Pacific time, and you can join us on allgames.com
71480	75960	and listen to us live and hang out in our chat room at allgames.com.
75960	76960	Why am I not allgames.com?
76960	81360	That's Bobby's chat room at Orange Lounge and pound Orange Lounge.
81360	85300	And you can also, uh, follow the chat at orangeloungeradio.com.
85300	89880	So yeah, it's another derpisode because Rob's not here and I'm kind of ill prepared.
89880	95240	So why don't we just go ahead and skip the formalities and go to how was our gaming week.
95240	98040	And mine, uh, I played WoW for 20 minutes a day every day.
98040	99040	That's it.
99040	100040	Loki?
100040	101040	Just 20 minutes?
101040	102040	Pretty much.
102040	104600	Except for the other night when I was doing, uh, the pet hunt.
104600	107520	How do you even play WoW for 20 minutes?
107520	110400	Uh, just go on to do dailies.
110400	111400	Wow.
111400	117840	Anyways, um, I played, uh, quite a few things actually this week besides the usual stuff.
117840	121920	More Grand Theft Auto, more Earth Defense Force, Insect Armageddon.
121920	129040	Um, I did play a few things, including some stuff I should be playing, like, um, Tiny
129040	130040	Tower.
130040	133880	I played a little bit of that just because I realized that there is an update to it and
133880	140280	I did the update and bought the two extra shops of each kind and a few extra residential
140280	147160	floors and, uh, added those all in there and my tower is super huge even though it technically
147160	153000	isn't cheating anymore because, uh, the credits and stuff aren't locked but, yeah, it's still
153000	154000	cheating.
154000	158040	Um, and, yeah, the game is still pointless.
158040	161840	And there's no extra achievements so there's really no reason for me to actually play it
161840	164400	but I did.
164400	170040	And then also on iOS I checked out Katamari Amore which is the new Katamari game for,
170040	174120	you know, the iPod, iPad, iPhone.
174120	175120	And it's alright.
175120	180120	I mean, once again, I don't really care too much for touch screen controls for a lot of
180120	184400	stuff, especially, you know, when it comes to virtual thumb sticks but it's alright.
184400	190920	It works pretty good and, um, you could check out the free version which is basically just
190920	197520	a time trial, um, level that's only two minutes long and if you want the rest of it you can
197520	200800	buy the download pack which is $3.99.
200800	205080	It's alright but, uh, definitely if you're thinking about picking it up try the demo
205080	210360	first and then if you like it then go ahead and, uh, you know, pay for the full thing.
210360	215040	Uh, and then finally the other thing I really shouldn't have been playing is a leaked game
215040	221560	that came out, um, it's a leaked Xbox Live arcade game called Saints Row Money Shot.
221560	226060	Now I'm not sure if this is actually a game that got cancelled or if it's a game that's
226060	227060	coming out.
227060	231560	I mean, it's possible it may be coming slightly before the launch of the game because there
231560	237200	are some, uh, unlocks for Saints Row the Third in the game itself.
237200	242600	You can unlock the hover bike and this, uh, sniper outfit and one of the sniper rifles.
242600	248040	Uh, but basically the whole game's premise is very similar to, like, the movie Wanted
248040	254120	or at least a section of it where you're firing the sniper rifle, um, and actually controlling
254120	260400	the trajectory of the bullet as you're, you know, flying to your intended target.
260400	265080	And so you can hit different things that will interact with the environment, um, like you'll
265080	270720	have different goals like, you know, kill three pigeons, um, you know, get a bunch of
270720	275520	close calls and that kind of thing and you unlock different bullets that have, you know,
275520	280120	uh, more speed, more, uh, turning ability, that kind of stuff.
280120	284380	But I mean, seriously, when they're moving faster, it's a lot harder to actually play
284380	285380	the game.
285380	290080	But, um, some of the cool stuff you can do, you know, there's one part where you hit a
290080	294160	wine bottle of this couple that's, you know, sitting there having a nice dinner in their,
294160	300600	you know, condo or apartment and that unfortunately causes the bottle to shatter and hit the candle
300600	305720	that's on the table and they both catch it on fire, or another one where it knocks out
305720	312360	the cane of an old woman and there's implied, you know, oral sex there and funny stuff like
312360	313360	that.
313360	316600	But, uh, you know, kind of the Saints Row over the top humor to go along with it.
316600	318400	Rated E for Everyone.
318400	319400	Of course.
319400	325960	Um, so it may be something that's still coming, um, it's definitely not the, uh, Saints Row
325960	330080	drive-by game that was supposed to become an Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network.
330080	334000	That was gonna be kind of like its own thing and that was the one that was supposed to
334000	335280	come to the 3DS.
335280	343520	Uh, but this game may very well come to Xbox Live Arcade, um, I would imagine this month
343520	347480	if it's gonna come at all, um, I don't know.
347480	348480	It was alright.
348480	352760	It was a little bit boring because there's only really three story levels.
352760	358240	The rest are kind of practice training levels, but then again, this isn't really a finished
358240	359240	build of the game.
359240	362760	It's something that came out back in June, but I don't know.
362760	363760	It'll be cool.
363760	367560	I definitely would want to check out the full version if it did come out just at the very
367560	369760	least for the unlocks.
369760	373440	Um, and that's pretty much it.
373440	375440	That's all I've been playing.
375440	378040	Well, sweetie?
378040	379040	Yes.
379040	383000	What have you been playing?
383000	385560	I played some Tetris DS.
385560	386560	Woo!
386560	387720	You've been watching a lot of videos.
387720	393320	Yeah, I spent a little time in the vault last week and, uh, played some Genesis stuff.
393320	395320	Besides that, nothing really current.
395320	398320	No, but you have been watching a lot of videos.
398320	399320	I watched a couple.
399320	403280	I watched a playthrough of Sapphire today, now it's kind of a cool game.
403280	404280	I love that game.
404280	406280	You didn't even know what it was.
406280	407280	What's this?
407280	410440	Well, no, I just walked in and it looked like a tank game for a minute and I was like, wait,
410440	411440	that's not a tank game.
411440	412440	It doesn't look like a tank game at all.
412440	414120	This is a big skull and I forgot that level, so shut up.
414120	415120	You know, you know what?
415120	416120	Here we're talking about.
416120	417120	Okay, you're fired.
417120	418120	Ah.
418120	421120	Everyone, Dan's kicked off the show.
421120	422120	Damn it.
422120	425120	Okay, you're rehired.
425120	427120	If you go get me something to drink.
427120	428120	No.
428120	431400	Okay, you're fired again.
431400	435120	So anyway, a little bit of housekeeping.
435120	439120	Basically, Rob's at Disneyland and we're all super jealous.
439120	441120	Well, at least I am.
441120	443560	Dan, are you super jealous?
443560	446400	I really want to see Space Mountain Ghost Galaxy.
446400	452120	Well, if all plans out, we're going, but not now.
452120	453120	Maybe.
453120	454120	Maybe.
454120	461080	So anyway, let's go ahead and move on from, let's move past Rob's absence and I'm over
461080	462080	it.
462080	463080	I'm over it.
463080	464520	I was a little upset for a while, but now I'm over it.
464520	466840	So how about we launch into the first story?
466840	472840	Sure, let's talk about the new Xbox 360 dashboard that's going to be coming out later this year.
472840	475800	Of course, it's assumed to be coming out sometime in the fall.
475800	482000	That's usually when their fall dashboards come out and yes, it's actually been leaked
482000	487920	according to an internal memo from PayPal, which is going to be part of the new dashboard.
487920	491040	They're going to be adding PayPal payments.
491040	498040	It's listed the release of this as November 15th and of course the dashboard update kind
498040	502840	of refreshes the whole look of it, kind of gives it the Windows phone, Windows 8 kind
502840	506960	of looked to the whole thing, which I kind of hate, but whatever.
506960	514240	But yeah, it's right now, November 15th is kind of the target date.
514240	515760	I mean, it's not a big surprise.
515760	522320	It's usually around between the end of October to the second week of November.
522320	527620	In fact, I think last year is about the same time anyways.
527620	528620	So we have that.
528620	536120	Of course, some more information regarding the supposed Xbox TV service they're going
536120	540760	to be having, some of the content providers that they're going to be featuring on this
540760	545720	according to Bloomberg, Comcast, Verizon.
545720	556280	They're also expecting the HBO, Crackle, Bravo, Syfy, LoveFilm and a lot more.
556280	560480	I guess also some stuff from Amazon as well.
560480	564480	So it looks like they're going to be trying to source content from, now I think not only
564480	571440	just cable providers, but actual cable content providers on top of just actually the cable
571440	572440	companies.
572440	579400	So maybe, for example, if you don't have cable, you may not be just locked out of all this,
579400	585140	which would be nice because I would prefer not to have cable, but getting a somewhat
585140	590920	okay deal right now, but in a year's time that may change and it'd be nice to have some
590920	595380	extra sources of content other than the internet.
595380	600520	And of course, I'll probably get a nice little peek of this pretty soon considering that
600520	608360	the dev kit dashboard update that's the preview for this fall thing also leaked to the internet
608360	616440	and been taken down pretty quickly, but it happened to snag a copy for my dev kit before
616440	620160	I did get taken down, so I will get a chance to check that out.
620160	625200	Although based on the YouTube videos I've seen, it's still rather boring because it's
625200	627560	basically what you see in the screenshots.
627560	630240	Because it's an Xbox menu.
630240	635840	Well, it's like I don't understand with each update, they kind of make it worse.
635840	638040	Bring back the blades, dammit.
638040	641040	I mean, that's what I use pretty much now anyways, it's just the blades.
641040	644280	Just hit the guide button, blades come up, and I'm hoping that's still the case with
644280	649640	this because I just really don't care for the new update.
649640	653340	And I understand why they're doing it, it's because they can say, hey, look at all this
653340	654640	ad space we've got.
654640	658960	We can advertise games, we can advertise services, we can have third party ads.
658960	664200	I mean, that's really what it's come down to and that's kind of scary if you think about
664200	666880	it because they're gonna do the same thing with Windows 8.
666880	670880	Thankfully with Windows 8 you can turn that off, kind of like you can turn off Media Center,
670880	673280	but I don't know.
673280	677760	I wish it was optional like Media Center.
677760	681640	I would think by now we have the technology to where we can customize the way that the
681640	682640	dashboard looks.
682640	685440	If I want the Windows 8 look, cool, I can do that.
685440	688380	If I want the old one, cool, I should be able to do that as well.
688380	691960	You know what I like about the updates to the dashboard, and it's not really even specific
691960	696060	to the dashboard but just part of the whole update package, I like the fact that they
696060	699060	stopped making the avatars look retarded.
699060	702360	They like re-proportioned them a little bit so their heads aren't all stupidly huge and
702360	706240	they look a little bit more like people but they still look like avatars.
706240	707520	That's awesome.
707520	708720	The Miis still look like bobbleheads.
708720	709720	Yeah, but Miis...
709720	710720	They're supposed to look like bobbleheads.
710720	712220	Miis always sucked.
712220	716160	The Xbox ones, I thought, weren't supposed to have that bobbleheaded look so I like it
716160	717160	too.
717160	718160	Right.
718160	721680	The avatars are like kind of neat but the Miis, yeah, were always just sort of creepy
721680	722680	looking.
722680	723680	Yeah.
723680	724680	Yeah.
724680	729040	So, I don't know, we'll just...
729040	733860	It's only, what, a month away so, I mean, whatever.
733860	738640	I'm just glad I'm not participating in the fall preview because I fucking hated that.
738640	742560	It's just like, oh hey look, we're pushing another dashboard update to you.
742560	743560	Every day.
743560	744560	Twice a day.
744560	749920	It's like, ugh, I have to sit here for another ten minutes while this shit downloads.
749920	750920	It wasn't worth it.
750920	754740	And I didn't even get anything free out of it like the people that tested, was it the
754740	762680	last dashboard thing with the XGT3 stuff where you got a free copy of Reach.
762680	763680	That didn't even work.
763680	765680	Well, at least when they updated it.
765680	769680	Well, you still get a games on demand version so it's...
769680	770680	Sweet.
770680	772680	Yeah, it's not too bad.
772680	775320	If you don't like hard drive space, it's great.
775320	776880	My turn?
776880	777880	Yes.
777880	778880	Okay.
778880	780440	Hey, guess what?
780440	783800	Microsoft's coming out with a new Windows phone that nobody's gonna buy.
783800	784800	Who's surprised?
784800	789840	It has swappable controller pads so you can have a keyboard, a touch screen, an extended
789840	792100	battery or a game controller.
792100	796960	The problem is, it's a Windows phone and everybody hates Windows phones.
796960	798640	Totally hate Windows phones.
798640	799640	Microsoft doesn't hate Windows phones.
799640	805900	I mean, after all, they're redesigning Windows to look like they're Windows phones.
805900	808720	They're just redesigning Windows to work on tablets.
808720	810200	That's the future for Microsoft.
810200	811200	They wanna...
811200	812200	They wanna get into the tablet business.
812200	814200	Well, and you can turn it off.
814200	815200	The phone business would be...
815200	816200	What, the phone?
816200	817200	No, with the PC version.
817200	818440	Turn what off?
818440	821520	You can turn off that tablet interface and go back to a classic interface on Windows
821520	822520	8.
822520	824520	Yeah, I understand that, but the damages are even done as far as I know.
824520	827520	You mean you can make Windows look like Windows?
827520	829800	Score!
829800	836760	I'm really sad that they took out the support to make Windows look like Windows 3.1.
836760	839040	You can make Windows look like old Windows?
839040	840040	Score!
840040	841040	Really?
841040	843280	I am so ready for Windows to be radically different.
843280	844720	I mean, it's fine.
844720	848960	Windows is Windows and you're used to Windows being what it is, but it is sort of like,
848960	854120	man, I sure would like to see Windows do something different.
854120	856600	I don't really think Windows now.
856600	863840	There's not anything I've done and said, you know, I really wish Windows 7 did this.
863840	865520	I'm fine with Windows 7.
865520	867120	Windows 7 does everything I need to do.
867120	872140	I don't need to interact with social networks any more than I already am.
872140	874960	I don't need them to post an update.
874960	876560	Matt just opened calculator.
876560	877560	Yeah.
877560	879880	No one fucking cares.
879880	882180	You know what's going to happen is they're going to get this whole thing with perfect
882180	886480	social network integration and right then the whole world's going to be like, eh, we're
886480	888160	done with social networks.
888160	891720	Let's move on to something else that's lame.
891720	892720	You know what?
892720	897620	Your article, that top attachment, I swear, looked like a Wiimote.
897620	898760	That's right.
898760	901160	It's the new Wii Microsoft phone.
901160	904720	Mic, Wii, I got nothing.
904720	905720	Micro Wii.
905720	906720	Nice.
906720	907720	Yeah.
907720	908720	Well, I don't know.
908720	913920	That kind of goes with what our friend used to call Microsoft, microflacid.
913920	920720	Anyway, how about some news that makes everybody happy because it has to do with portal.
920720	925920	There is new download content for portal 2, which is called Peer Review, and it is a free
925920	932240	download for PC, PS3, and Xbox 360, available on October 4th.
932240	939320	It has more of the co-op modes for Atlas and Peabody, who are the cutie little robots that
939320	943160	like to hug so much, and hey, this article has my desktop wallpaper on it.
943160	947500	GLaDOS will be there, so that's going to be cool, and there's also a challenge mode for
947500	953920	co-op and single player that has leaderboard support, and if you want some more free stuff,
953920	959680	the third and fourth group of tracks from the portal 2 soundtrack, Music to Test by,
959680	963460	is on Valve's site right now, which I need to download them.
963460	968280	Probably some more ringtones and message sounds, I bet.
968280	969280	Cool.
969280	974640	I actually have the Turret Symphony as one of my ringtones.
974640	979240	The little one that you hear, the four little turrets practicing in the little level.
979240	981000	You must be so proud.
981000	982000	I am!
982000	983000	Shut up!
983000	985000	I'm not proud of your face.
985000	986600	Wah wah.
986600	987600	Okay.
987600	989360	Well that's it for that one.
989360	995960	Well, this is a little bit interesting, and a little bit disappointing, because I kind
995960	1000720	of, I read this, and you know, I was craving Subway anyways because I had a coupon for
1000720	1003320	it, and although it wasn't before the store went to.
1003320	1004800	Yeah, why do you need a coupon for Subway?
1004800	1005800	It's all $5 anyway.
1005800	1009760	Well yeah, I understand that, but you know, I wasn't gonna actually use it right now,
1009760	1014880	and it was for like, you know, get a bunch of like, footlongs for free and that kind
1014880	1015880	of stuff.
1015880	1016880	Multiple sandwiches.
1016880	1017880	That's a pretty good coupon.
1017880	1022800	Um, but, so I went down to Subway because they've got this thing going on right now
1022800	1029840	with Uncharted 3, where if you go down to Subway, you can actually get a code to play
1029840	1036400	in the, I guess the multiplayer beta or multiplayer portion of Uncharted 3 throughout the month
1036400	1037400	of October.
1037400	1038400	Dude, I saw that!
1038400	1040400	I should have got a drink.
1040400	1046680	Yeah, it's a 30 ounce drink, and basically, not only do you get a PlayStation Network
1046680	1052600	code for that, to play the multiplayer portion of the game, but you also get an exclusive
1052600	1060760	item which earns you the ability to do the Subway footlong taunt, you know, the $5 footlong
1060760	1062240	thing that they do in the commercials.
1062240	1063240	Nice.
1063240	1068560	So you have that taunt as well, that you can earn from getting a drink.
1068560	1072640	And here I was all ready to get a drink, in fact...
1072640	1073640	You even got a drink!
1073640	1077760	Yeah, well no, to go back to what I was talking about earlier before the show started, how
1077760	1082920	the person at Subway was really stupid, I asked for a large drink, and she rang me up
1082920	1086640	for a small drink, because she is stupid.
1086640	1088740	Did you reach her across the counter and pimp-slap her?
1088740	1092760	I should have, but once again though, I looked at their cups, and their cups did not have
1092760	1095200	the new stuff on them.
1095200	1101760	I'm sure that participation will vary by location based on whether they're phasing out their
1101760	1103440	old inventory or not, so...
1103440	1106760	You know, often those promotions are even no purchase required, you can probably just
1106760	1109880	ask for a code and they have to give it to you.
1109880	1114880	Maybe, but I'm sure that this woman would have not known what the hell I was talking
1114880	1115880	about.
1115880	1117520	Should have been like, footlongs are $5!
1117520	1118520	Woo!
1118520	1119520	Exactly.
1119520	1120520	Yay!
1120520	1121520	Footlongs $5, yay!
1121520	1126840	And they're probably trying to get you really psyched up about the online portion of Uncharted
1126840	1130560	3, because the online portion will require a Playstation Network pass.
1130560	1135840	Yes, Sony has of course jumped on board with the whole online pass thing, starting with
1135840	1141440	Resistance 3, and of course, unsurprisingly, continuing on with Uncharted 3.
1141440	1148240	And it's a one-time use code that will require all players to enter it in, in order to play
1148240	1151200	the online portion of Uncharted 3.
1151200	1157240	Although, if you're like me, you probably couldn't give two shits about the online portion
1157240	1159480	of Uncharted 3.
1159480	1163480	So I don't know.
1163480	1167400	But yeah, if you buy the game used, you're gonna have to pay $10 if someone's already
1167400	1170680	activated the code.
1170680	1175440	And of course, this is to combat piracy, but really it's just, you know, make a little
1175440	1178080	money on the back end from used copies.
1178080	1183480	It's what you call a shameless cash grab, and a way to put the screws into GameStop,
1183480	1186080	and which I'm kind of down with, because fuck GameStop!
1186080	1188800	No, I don't have any problem with GameStop, really.
1188800	1190800	I have a problem with GameStop.
1190800	1193440	Yeah, me too.
1193440	1195680	Hey, you like movies?
1195680	1196680	No.
1196680	1197680	Yes.
1197680	1198680	You like zombies?
1198680	1199680	Yes.
1199680	1200680	You like movies about zombies?
1200680	1201680	Yes.
1201680	1203080	You like movies based on video games?
1203080	1204200	What?
1204200	1207880	Looks like Dead Island might already be getting a movie.
1207880	1209040	People are already looking at it.
1209040	1215400	Looks like Lionsgate and producer Sean Daniel, who apparently was responsible for Tombstone
1215400	1222240	and Dazed and Confused, two very decent movies, is thinking, hey, this looks like it'd be
1222240	1227480	a great movie, but seriously, all zombie movies are the goddamn same anyway, except for, you
1227480	1230200	know, Shaun of the Dead, which was hilarious.
1230200	1231680	So guess what?
1231680	1232680	I like Wild Zero.
1232680	1233680	Good.
1233680	1235680	Which I still have your copy.
1235680	1236680	Great.
1236680	1237680	Huh?
1237680	1238680	Nothing.
1238680	1239680	Wild Zero?
1239680	1240680	Yeah.
1240680	1241680	If you like zombie movies, there's more coming.
1241680	1245840	If you like Dead Island, watch the big screen.
1245840	1251080	And I mean, they're trying to make it an emotional zombie movie, so they're basing it off a trailer,
1251080	1255320	which, which is great because the trailer had nothing to do with the actual game.
1255320	1259320	Aren't zombie movies always pretty emotional?
1259320	1261720	Zombies are into the pursuit of brains.
1261720	1263920	That's heartfelt right there.
1263920	1266440	They're like, I feel for their play.
1266440	1268680	And people run in fear with great passion.
1268680	1269680	People?
1269680	1271960	There's people in these movies?
1271960	1273760	Yeah, the people that end up being food.
1273760	1275440	I thought those people were just food.
1275440	1278720	And you know, what's kind of annoying though is all these zombie movies nowadays, especially
1278720	1281640	starting after, what was it, 28 days.
1281640	1284880	Yeah, they all have the smart killer zombies.
1284880	1285880	Like the ones that run.
1285880	1286880	I mean, come on.
1286880	1290360	They don't have the shuffling undead because the shuffling undead aren't interesting anymore.
1290360	1293800	But the funny thing about zombie movies was it was always just about the fact that they
1293800	1296200	were slow but unstoppable.
1296200	1298680	Now they're all fast and unstoppable.
1298680	1300800	And they're fast and unstoppable and they think.
1300800	1302860	Which you know what that really makes them?
1302860	1305960	Not fucking zombies.
1305960	1307080	Really guys.
1307080	1311400	I want them to do a zombie movie where the people aren't zombies but all the animals
1311400	1312400	are.
1312400	1313520	You know what would be great?
1313520	1314520	Like zombie cows.
1314520	1315520	They did a movie about Resident Evil.
1315520	1319000	Yeah, well kind of like Pet Sematary, yeah, but they're all like church and the people
1319000	1320000	don't come back.
1320000	1322780	But they're attacking all the people.
1322780	1323780	Zombie animals.
1323780	1325520	But would they turn the people into zombies?
1325520	1328480	No, they just eat them.
1328480	1329480	I'd watch that.
1329480	1331000	That'd be a good movie.
1331000	1334160	Copyright Dark Sakura 2011 blah blah blah blah.
1334160	1335600	That movie sounds really stupid.
1335600	1336600	So do you.
1336600	1337600	Okay, next story.
1337600	1338600	You got me there.
1338600	1339600	I love you.
1339600	1340760	You mean it.
1340760	1341760	Next story.
1341760	1342760	How about Nintendo Power?
1342760	1345320	Who of us grew up with Nintendo Power?
1345320	1346320	All of us.
1346320	1347320	Get the power.
1347320	1348320	Nintendo Power.
1348320	1350040	I was published in Nintendo Power once.
1350040	1351040	What?
1351040	1352040	You're lying.
1352040	1353040	I'm not lying.
1353040	1354040	Prove it.
1354040	1359120	I'll have to find the issue but it was the one doing the immortality thing for Mega Man
1359120	1360120	3.
1360120	1365240	Well I happen to know a guy who has almost every issue of Nintendo Power so we're gonna
1365240	1366240	find out.
1366240	1367240	Okay.
1367240	1368240	Fine.
1368240	1370240	So anyway.
1370240	1373140	They are being distributed.
1373140	1379380	It's distributed in the US by the same people that do Playstation, the official Xbox magazine,
1379380	1381160	and of course there's Nintendo Power.
1381160	1384680	They do Best Spies at Gamer and PC Gamer.
1384680	1394240	And they're actually saying that since people are, you know, first of all, poor, broke,
1394240	1397240	you can't see the magazine very well at the newsstand, I mean it's really not getting
1397240	1403520	a big order, and the digital revenues are where the money is, that basically they're
1403520	1409040	thinking about changing how they do Nintendo Power in the US.
1409040	1414200	They are thinking about doing it digital only instead of doing it in print, but then again
1414200	1419640	as someone pointed out earlier in chat, EGM went away and they came back.
1419640	1422080	So nice.
1422080	1429440	In my world, when Nintendo quit publishing Nintendo Power, it quit being Nintendo Power.
1429440	1431440	It just did.
1431440	1433120	It was the end of an era then.
1433120	1438060	Now if it goes away, it's just another magazine going away, but when Nintendo published it,
1438060	1440520	it was the official Nintendo propaganda magazine.
1440520	1442800	That would be like Napster going away now.
1442800	1444680	It's like, who cares.
1444680	1448440	In fact, when he said Napster, I'm like, is Napster still around?
1448440	1449440	Yeah it is.
1449440	1453040	It's a legit music service now.
1453040	1454040	No one cared.
1454040	1456560	When they're like, we're going legit, everyone's like, we're going elsewhere.
1456560	1457560	Exactly.
1457560	1460880	I was like, wait a minute, I can't steal music for free?
1460880	1461880	Fuck this.
1461880	1462880	I'm out.
1462880	1468480	Well according to Gamasutra, Future is going to be doing their update for their plan starting
1468480	1476160	on I believe, they're going to show what the plan is for November 24th and later, through
1476160	1477160	2012.
1477160	1478760	If anyone cares.
1478760	1479760	Some people care.
1479760	1480760	Damn it.
1480760	1481760	I care.
1481760	1482760	A little.
1482760	1483760	Next.
1483760	1488920	Well cool, let's talk a little bit about what's coming out soon.
1488920	1489920	Starting with October.
1489920	1490920	In the U.S.
1490920	1491920	Oh wait, isn't this our music?
1491920	1494480	No, we don't have music for this section of the show.
1494480	1495920	Well, I did it anyway.
1495920	1496920	We have music.
1496920	1498560	Okay, so what's coming out?
1498560	1500920	I refuse to have music.
1500920	1501920	Fine.
1501920	1502920	Anyways.
1502920	1510040	Today, actually, Tetris Axis came out on Nintendo 3DS, and it was great.
1510040	1514800	Earlier this week, Kotaku had actually run a little bit of a, they do this stupid video
1514800	1519640	blogging crap for some of the games that they get to test and stuff, like, ooh look, we
1519640	1520640	got the test.
1520640	1526280	And they were showing off the augmented reality portions of Tetris Axis, and man, that looks
1526280	1527660	retarded.
1527660	1533240	I'm so glad that I'm not a big Tetris fan, because it's just like, hey, look, I gotta
1533240	1537600	put a card down on a table and I gotta walk around the table while I play Tetris.
1537600	1538600	What's the point to that?
1538600	1540440	I mean, seriously.
1540440	1543360	So that's coming out this week on the 3DS.
1543360	1548240	On Xbox 360, Motion Explosion by Majesco.
1548240	1551320	It's just a weird mini-game collection for the Kinect.
1551320	1553160	What do you expect?
1553160	1556840	Dark Souls on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
1556840	1559040	Yes, I tend to rhyme sometimes.
1559040	1562520	Sometimes you're clever.
1562520	1568480	Gunslingers coming out on the Wii, and this is kind of an on-rails, western shooter game.
1568480	1577840	NBA 2K12 coming out on PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, and PSP.
1577840	1583200	Rage coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.
1583200	1588620	Age of Enigma, The Secret of the Sixth Ghost on PC.
1588620	1590280	No idea what that is.
1590280	1597680	Spider-Man Edge of Time on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, 3DS, and NDS.
1597680	1602640	And hopefully it's not as terrible as X-Men Destiny, because that game has gotten some
1602640	1604120	pretty terrible reviews.
1604120	1607400	That game got murdered in the reviews.
1607400	1611680	Oh yeah, it's really nice that you put this unfinished game out.
1611680	1613680	You know what's sad about that game, too?
1613680	1620840	It's made by Silicon Knights, who at one time was a really decent publisher, and now they're
1620840	1625240	just bootsy.
1625240	1628440	Girls Only coming out on Nintendo DS.
1628440	1630080	It is for girls only.
1630080	1634920	They will shoot you on sight if you try to buy that and you're not a girl.
1634920	1637560	I was hoping it would be like Boobalicious or something.
1637560	1639960	No, it's not that good, I'm sorry.
1639960	1644920	It's just some crappy girl-targeted game.
1644920	1647680	How to knit and shop.
1647680	1650040	Umm, yeah.
1650040	1651040	And makeup.
1651040	1654400	Face Raiders Photo Finish 3DS.
1654400	1658840	It's an awesome kart racing game where you can take a picture and put your face on the
1658840	1664960	kart or the person driving the kart, because everybody really wants to do that in a stupid
1664960	1665960	kart racing game.
1665960	1669560	You know you can do that on the arcade version of Mario Kart?
1669560	1671160	Really unaware of that.
1671160	1672160	Yes.
1672160	1674160	I'm so unaware of that.
1674160	1677280	Glad I have no memory of doing that at my bachelor party.
1677280	1681280	Oh, good.
1681280	1683680	That wasn't your face.
1683680	1690200	Sid Meier's Civilization V Game of the Year Edition on PC, and they made me drive as Luigi.
1690200	1692280	That is just a crime right there.
1692280	1694440	I think it was Luigi.
1694440	1696200	I was so messed up.
1696200	1700400	I have no memory of it until I saw the video.
1700400	1706920	Gabrielle's Ghostly Groove on the 3DS, it's a rhythm music game.
1706920	1711520	And then finally, one week from today, Just Dance 3 coming out on Xbox 360, and Wii, PlayStation
1711520	1717240	3, who the hell knows when that's coming out because it's been delayed.
1717240	1718800	That is it.
1718800	1724600	Alright, so for everyone in, I guess this is the UK, is this all of Europe?
1724600	1725600	This is UK.
1725600	1729360	For everyone in the UK, here's some releases this week.
1729360	1735320	Really the only one that matters, Chrono Trigger hits PSN on the 4th, Crysis for the Xbox 360
1735320	1743960	and the PlayStation 3, NBA Jam on Fire Edition, which is a download, Orcs Must Die, I gotta
1743960	1745360	believe that's a download, I'm not really sure.
1745360	1747080	I think all those are downloads so far.
1747080	1752200	Payday of the High, Sega Bass Fishing, Space Channel 5 Part 2, all that crap comes out
1752200	1753340	on the 5th.
1753340	1756040	It's like, really?
1756040	1763340	Dark Souls for the 360 and PS3 on the 7th, NBA 2K12, Power Up Heroes and Rage, as well
1763340	1767520	as the Cursed Crusade, all land on the 7th as well.
1767520	1771360	I'm actually really interested to check out Crysis on 360 when that comes out, I think
1771360	1777380	that's actually next week I believe, because I played it on PC and it was pretty fun up
1777380	1781800	until the end where the game decided, hey, you know what, work, I don't want to do it.
1781800	1788640	I'm interested to see it from a technological standpoint, Crysis, you know, was a real system
1788640	1789640	killer.
1789640	1792320	Yeah, it was a really unoptimized piece of shit.
1792320	1797640	I can't wait to see if they manage to make it run well on the 360 and PS3, or if it's
1797640	1798640	going to run like Crysis.
1798640	1802680	Well, they did with Warhead, remember, they totally revamped the whole engine, it's like,
1802680	1806540	oh hey, yeah, by the way, remember that game that killed all your PCs, yeah, we finally
1806540	1809160	got around to optimizing it, now that could run in pretty much everything.
1809160	1814600	Well, that's what I'm saying, I just want to see if it will run on the 360 and what
1814600	1815600	not.
1815600	1817920	I hear that, you know, my understanding is that happens a lot, and I'll ask you about
1817920	1820880	this later, but I was talking to someone about GTA for the PC.
1820880	1824960	Oh yeah, it's a terrible, very unoptimized, I mean.
1824960	1829240	It's like, oh, it takes such a PC to run it, you know, because I saw, did you see the link
1829240	1833960	that I posted to the Vice City mod that somebody did?
1833960	1835680	I think I've seen those mods before.
1835680	1837880	I've got to play that.
1837880	1839260	That's going to be so good.
1839260	1843320	But anyways, so there's the releases for the UK.
1843320	1846680	I wonder what's coming out in Japan.
1846680	1848760	How about Child of Eden?
1848760	1849760	Coming out on the 6th.
1849760	1850760	How about it?
1850760	1853360	Well, this is the Xbox 360 list.
1853360	1862360	F1 2011, Oga Mosokoku X, no sorry, Kyoku X, my bad, Rage, and the Gun Stringer.
1862360	1871960	And then moving forward to Playstation 3, we have Major League Baseball 2K11, Child
1871960	1878800	of Eden as well, and F1 2011, what, what did you say?
1878800	1879800	Sorry.
1879800	1880800	Oh.
1880800	1889680	God of War, Chains of Olympus, and Ghost of Sparta HD, Rage, World Soccer winning 11 2012,
1889680	1894640	Ace Combat, that's getting a little bit further past, my bad.
1894640	1900160	On the Vita, we have nothing, because it's on the list for some stupid reason.
1900160	1906840	On the PSP,.hack link, for PSP the best, it's a re-released, AKB 148, that's idled
1906840	1913800	to Guam to Koshitara, and that's going to be a bunch of limited editions too.
1913800	1918560	Okashi Nashima no Peter Pan, Sweet Neverland is also going to be out in a regular limited
1918560	1922960	edition, and Phantom Kingdom Portable will be out on the 6th, with a limited edition
1922960	1923960	as well.
1923960	1932640	Tsugi no Giseisha o Oshirase Shimasu, Kimitoko no Hateru Kotanai Kurayami O is going to
1932640	1935960	be out on the 6th by Booston.
1935960	1941840	And let's see what else we have on the Wii, Just Dance Wii, but that's not until next
1941840	1943140	week.
1943140	1950820	On the 3DS we have Super Black Bass 3D Fight, which makes fishing sound cool, I guess.
1950820	1955040	On the PS2, nothing, because no one care.
1955040	1959400	And on the DS, nothing, although Super Scribblenuts will be coming out next week, which is kind
1959400	1960760	of cool.
1960760	1967360	And for Japanese PC gamers, Batman Arkham City, Battlefield 3, that's about it.
1967360	1968360	Really?
1968360	1970480	There's some other stuff, but they're not giving us dates.
1970480	1971960	I'm surprised they're getting that so early.
1971960	1972960	No one care.
1972960	1974800	Arkham City is going to be awesome.
1974800	1977440	Just as October is at the top of the list, so I'll set it.
1977440	1981320	That's probably just sometime in October, I doubt that they're getting it that early.
1981320	1984320	No, but it gives our friends overseas something to look forward to.
1984320	1987400	Something you can look forward to, but when you go to the store this week, you're not
1987400	1988400	going to find it there.
1988400	1995160	I didn't say it was this week, I said it was this month.
1995160	2002240	This is kind of strange, they've got this game coming out for iOS called Life of George.
2002240	2006280	You might be thinking, is this some sort of documentary game based on George Washington?
2006280	2007280	No.
2007280	2014760	It's a Lego game, actually, where you're challenged to build different things that you see in
2014760	2019120	this photo album using actual bricks.
2019120	2022200	You buy a $30 kit from the Lego store.
2022200	2025480	You've already kind of lost me there because it's a $30 kit, and I'm assuming it comes
2025480	2028880	with like 10 pieces.
2028880	2036440	Apparently, it comes with this green screen like a building mat, and so you're challenged
2036440	2041240	to recreate 120 different models, or build your own models and then have them scanned
2041240	2044040	into the game.
2044040	2050680	You're awarded based on accuracy and how quick you put everything together.
2050680	2061200	But really, a $30 iOS game, and I have not actually seen what this Lego kit is, but I'm
2061200	2066920	going to be willing to bet that it's probably, considering the price of Legos, which is really
2066920	2075520	ridiculous, it's probably like 20 pieces, so it wouldn't be that difficult to recreate
2075520	2076520	everything.
2076520	2081040	But just out of curiosity, let's see, Life of George.
2081040	2083240	That actually does sound kind of cool.
2083240	2085100	Because you're a Lego addict.
2085100	2088360	And at the same time, devastatingly stupid.
2088360	2089360	Whoa!
2089360	2090360	Yes.
2090360	2091360	I am surprised.
2091360	2092920	It's actually 146 pieces.
2092920	2096400	That's actually not bad for Legos.
2096400	2099360	But from that picture, they're like really basic pieces.
2099360	2102920	Well, yeah, I'd imagine.
2102920	2107920	You know, I would probably just play with the Legos separately anyway and not care.
2107920	2109220	So I'd just go buy Legos.
2109220	2112120	That game better be free once you buy that stupid kit.
2112120	2114120	That's all I gotta say.
2114120	2117280	No, it's $44.99.
2117280	2120040	That sounds to me like, was it TomTom or whatever like that?
2120040	2122840	Oh hey, you gotta buy this GPS thing, 70 bucks.
2122840	2125680	Oh, dude, we mentioned the software's another 40.
2125680	2127960	Yeah, we hate you.
2127960	2132320	We want your money and you are gullible, so give it to us.
2132320	2133320	How's that?
2133320	2134320	Like that?
2134320	2135320	Yeah.
2135320	2138640	Well, how about something, you know, you could gamble on that game or you could gamble for
2138640	2139640	reals.
2139640	2140640	Ew.
2140640	2141640	Full House Poker.
2141640	2143800	Which, I actually know people who are playing this.
2143800	2145640	And me, I don't like poker.
2145640	2149600	I really don't like gambling games, but oh well.
2149600	2155840	But the Texas Heat tournament is on day 119 on Xbox Live.
2155840	2164520	And it's apparently super popular, but it's not getting a fall update, but it's not going
2164520	2165520	away.
2165520	2169720	They just said that they plan to refresh the Texas Heat season in the future.
2169720	2172040	So what does that mean?
2172040	2174580	That means that, oh, we're not gonna change anything.
2174580	2179600	We're just gonna say, oh, new tournament start, here's the same thing.
2179600	2181000	But it's still there if you like it.
2181000	2184660	At least it's not going the way of 1 versus 100.
2184660	2185660	As in, away.
2185660	2189120	1 versus 100 was, like, really, really cool.
2189120	2190760	Yes it was.
2190760	2195520	But I would think that 1 versus 100 versus, like, I mean, this is kind of like, you know,
2195520	2200400	the World Series of Poker almost, but on a very, very small scale.
2200400	2207160	This I can see, you know, being able to play a lot more without actual structure in a season
2207160	2212080	versus 1 versus 100, which is more of like a trivia game that's kind of, you know, host-driven
2212080	2214880	and it'd be a little difficult.
2214880	2219640	You know, I can see how they're able to carry it on beyond, you know, like a season.
2219640	2224040	Even the 1 versus 100 extended play, though, just the practice rounds, were fun just to
2224040	2226940	pop on there and play.
2226940	2229120	I never played them, and I'm disappointed.
2229120	2234420	I'm actually very disappointed that Bob Saget was not the host on, you know, the online
2234420	2235420	version.
2235420	2236420	Yeah.
2236420	2237960	Bob Saget's a gangster.
2237960	2239960	He's so cool.
2239960	2244240	I mean, you know, actually, there's been one poker game that's come out that I like, and
2244240	2246640	that's Poker Night at the Inventory.
2246640	2249040	I still have got to download that.
2249040	2250040	$4.
2250040	2253200	Like, I watched Jamie play, see, I don't want to pay $4 for it, though.
2253200	2254200	You paid $4 for it.
2254200	2255200	You played it on my computer, G.
2255200	2256200	I don't like your computer.
2256200	2257200	Cheapo.
2257200	2259000	Then put a copy of my account on your computer.
2259000	2262560	See, that's what I'm talking about.
2262560	2263560	Four fucking dollars.
2263560	2264560	You're so Dutch.
2264560	2265560	What do I look like?
2265560	2266560	I'm made of money.
2266560	2267560	You're so Dutch.
2267560	2268560	Whatever, Jew.
2268560	2277500	Okay, so anyway, how about you talk about something that actually matters to people
2277500	2284360	instead of just throwing out, you know, religious and ancestry-related comments.
2284360	2286840	What in the crap are you talking about?
2286840	2287840	Classic game, duh.
2287840	2288840	Oh, classic game.
2288840	2289840	This is music for classic games.
2289840	2296840	This music is entirely too happy for classic games.
2296840	2298720	So start talking about it.
2298720	2300520	Is this really the music for classic games?
2300520	2301720	It's the intro music, dumbass.
2301720	2307480	I need something cool like the black hole music from one of the Advance Wars games.
2307480	2308480	That'd be amazing.
2308480	2309480	How about this?
2309480	2310480	All right.
2310480	2311480	Anyways.
2311480	2312480	Pause that for a second.
2312480	2315840	I've got to play it in the background.
2315840	2319280	Anyways, before we get into this whole classic game of the week thing, you know, I want to
2319280	2320840	just throw this out there.
2320840	2325360	The whole reason Jamie's been doing this thing for years is because it was stolen from me.
2325360	2327240	I know everything about classic games.
2327240	2328240	La, la, la, la, la, la, la.
2328240	2329240	So just shut up.
2329240	2330240	I'm going to unplug your mic.
2330240	2331240	No, you're not.
2331240	2332240	I know everything about classic games.
2332240	2333240	I am the boss.
2333240	2335360	And everybody knows this, right?
2335360	2336920	I'm the master of the vault.
2336920	2339800	I'm the one who keeps and maintains the collection.
2339800	2344160	When Jamie comes to give you guys classic games, you know who she asks for them?
2344160	2345160	Me.
2345160	2348840	So anyways, if you like classic game of the week, thank you.
2348840	2354120	I appreciate your work and I appreciate Jamie's work in bringing you so many classic games.
2354120	2355600	Dance is not getting late tonight.
2355600	2356600	Whatever.
2356600	2357840	I was going to get late anyway.
2357840	2361840	You can flip me the bird for like an hour if you really, really want to.
2361840	2362840	But anyways.
2362840	2363840	Okay.
2363840	2364840	Can I play the music again?
2364840	2365840	Start the music.
2365840	2366840	Shut up.
2366840	2370840	Still without the damn game.
2370840	2374840	So anyone who recognizes this music is automatically awesome because this is the first level theme
2374840	2376380	from Thunder Force 3.
2376380	2377380	Thank you, Zeta.
2377380	2378380	You win a cookie.
2378380	2383240	Thunder Force 3 is one of the absolute best side scrolling shooters on the Genesis.
2383240	2385840	I bought it when it first came out.
2385840	2388040	It came out in 1990.
2388040	2390880	We don't get an exact date because Wikipedia sucks rocks.
2390880	2392320	It came out in 1990.
2392320	2397420	I know one of the first nights it was out, I went over to software, etc. and bought it.
2397420	2401920	Took it home and proceeded to have it blow my mind for like months on end.
2401920	2404360	It was one of the first games to have line scrolling.
2404360	2406280	It had selectable levels.
2406280	2409560	It just made Thunder Force 2 look like a pile of crap.
2409560	2411280	It was really that much better.
2411280	2416840	In fact, Thunder Force 3 for the Genesis was so good that they took it and they made an
2416840	2419640	arcade version out of the Genesis game.
2419640	2423160	And then when they put it on SNES, they ported the arcade version.
2423160	2426520	And it still wasn't as good, although it is a damn good SNES game.
2426520	2429920	Nothing beats the original Genesis version.
2429920	2435000	The basic idea is that this giant computer, get this, you'll never have seen this coming,
2435000	2436600	has taken over the galaxy.
2436600	2437600	Who knows?
2437600	2439040	Yeah, I know.
2439040	2442920	And the irony is that humanity created the giant computer.
2442920	2446380	So if you haven't beaten the game, sorry about that, that was a big spoiler.
2446380	2451900	And so they dispatched you to go in there with your ship, one ship, and annihilate like
2451900	2454880	jillions of enemies and wipe them all out.
2454880	2460200	The levels scroll every which way, the backgrounds move, you face ships that make the giant ship
2460200	2462480	in R-type look like a tinker toy.
2462480	2463480	Giant flowers.
2463480	2466840	Yeah, yeah, you shoot some giant flowers too.
2466840	2469400	Giant fish.
2469400	2470400	It's awesome.
2470400	2472480	It's really hard to describe how great this game is.
2472480	2476320	If you can throw down an emulator or if you have to take a Genesis, like I'm sure some
2476320	2479600	of you do, you really need to play this game.
2479600	2482700	What else should I say about it?
2482700	2488040	How about the differences between the different versions maybe?
2488040	2490420	All ports of the same game.
2490420	2491680	So they're essentially the same.
2491680	2494720	I guess when you go to Thunder Spirits in the arcade or Thunder Spirits on the SNES
2494720	2498860	or Thunder Force arcade, you lose the level select, they add in some levels from Thunder
2498860	2502320	Force 2, they take out some levels from Thunder Force 3.
2502320	2505140	The Genesis version is really the one to play.
2505140	2508600	But if you don't happen to own a Genesis, you suck.
2508600	2512280	If you don't happen to own a Genesis and you do have a SNES, you can go ahead and just
2512280	2513280	get on SNES.
2513280	2517400	Or if you have a Saturn, especially a Japanese Saturn, they released two collections called
2517400	2522160	Thunder Force Gold Pack 1 and Thunder Force Gold Pack 2 that had all the various Thunder
2522160	2524640	Force games on them.
2524640	2527360	I remember you trying to play this on the Nomad and yelling at it.
2527360	2529480	I beat the crap out of this game on the Nomad.
2529480	2531840	I know, but you were like, the bullets are small!
2531840	2537640	Well, the problem with any shooter on a handheld system is that bullets are extremely small.
2537640	2543080	And in Thunder Force, even on a full-sized screen, the backgrounds move so much that
2543080	2546560	you tend to lose the bullets and then you just have these phantom decks.
2546560	2549000	And when you die, you lose the weapon that you collected.
2549000	2553920	And it's not as big a disaster as it is in like Gradius when you die, you know, you don't
2553920	2559400	start from zero, but if you really like the Hunter or Wave weapons and you get hit and
2559400	2564280	lose them, then you have to, you know, soldier through without them until you get another
2564280	2565280	Wave weapon.
2565280	2566280	This level pisses me off.
2566280	2569600	You guys should be able to see this, because this level is totally sweet.
2569600	2573960	Well, how about if someone reminds me, I will repost it to our Tumblr.
2573960	2574960	To your thing.
2574960	2577280	I'll put it on our Tumblr.
2577280	2578280	You'll tumble it.
2578280	2582120	I feel like they're flying through the first level of Castlevania X.
2582120	2589640	Yeah, except for like this game came out like four years before Castlevania Dracula XX,
2589640	2592160	the Rondo of Blood.
2592160	2595520	That's pretty cool though, but yeah, I completely suck at this game by one minute.
2595520	2596520	I've tried.
2596520	2600560	It's really not that hard of, there's way, way more difficult shooters.
2600560	2605240	I can definitely one credit it, if not one life at any rate.
2605240	2607440	Well, I think our type is harder.
2607440	2611360	Oh, our type is blisteringly difficult compared to Thunder Force.
2611360	2614800	Like the first time you play Thunder Force III, you think, oh, it's fast and difficult,
2614800	2616400	but the weapons are awesome.
2616400	2621040	When you get a powered up ship, if you're not really lame, you know, it's hard to die.
2621040	2623760	Our type is just really easy to die.
2623760	2624760	Yeah.
2624760	2626440	The difference is our type is like a thinking man shooter.
2626440	2631360	It's slow and it's all about positioning the ship and, you know, handling the obstacles
2631360	2632360	correctly.
2632360	2634240	Thunder Force is much more of a twitch shooter.
2634240	2637160	Yeah, I see that.
2637160	2640760	Well, how about some boss music before we go to break?
2640760	2641760	I don't care.
2641760	2642760	Play whatever you want.
2642760	2650040	Shoot, shoot, bang, bang, pew, pew, lasers, pew, pew.
2650040	2652920	And that is our classic game of the week.
2652920	2654440	My classic game of the week.
2654440	2664840	Thunder Force III on Genesis slash micro drive slash Genesis and the SNES and the arcade.
2664840	2667200	And you could also play it on the Saturn.
2667200	2668760	Yeah, all that too.
2668760	2669760	All right.
2669760	2670760	Well, guess what?
2670760	2675200	That's the end of part A and I'm going to do the ritual saving of part A now so stay
2675200	2676200	tuned.
2676200	2677960	I will keep you occupied with Mega Man music.
2677960	2679960	This is the part where we sacrifice a goat.
2679960	2680960	No.
2680960	2683400	Well, as long as we get to make some curry out of it later.
2683400	2684400	Take that, goat.
2684400	2685400	Okay.
2685400	2688400	Everyone, stay tuned.
2688400	2697240	And we are back from our break.
2697240	2698480	Thank you for sticking with us.
2698480	2705840	This is of course Orange Lounge Radio and as I said before at beginning of part A, Rob
2705840	2706840	is gone.
2706840	2707840	He's at Disneyland.
2707840	2712580	We locked him in the firehouse in Walt's bedroom and we've taken over.
2712580	2718640	So it is me tonight, DarkSakura, Loki, and that dude that I picked up on the internet,
2718640	2719640	Dan.
2719640	2722640	The notorious D-A-N.
2722640	2723640	What what?
2723640	2724640	What?
2724640	2725640	What?
2725640	2726640	Hearts.
2726640	2727640	What?
2727640	2728640	Hi.
2728640	2729640	Hi.
2729640	2730640	Yeah, that's Dan.
2730640	2731640	I married him.
2731640	2732640	I get to live with that.
2732640	2733640	I love you.
2733640	2734640	Anyway.
2734640	2735640	Oh, sure.
2735640	2736640	Yeah, sure.
2736640	2739280	So how about we just go ahead and get into rapid fire news?
2739280	2740280	Yes, let's.
2740280	2742280	Let's talk about some of the money stuff.
2742280	2743280	Yeah.
2743280	2744280	Yes.
2744280	2745280	Dance Dance Revolution is not gone.
2745280	2749800	Surprisingly, actually, they keep announcing more tracks for Dance Dance Revolution 2, a
2749800	2753760	game that's coming out on the Wii, actually in a couple weeks here.
2753760	2758840	So the fourth song reveal set here, let's go down the list.
2758840	2761760	We've got Dazzlin Darlin by HHH.
2761760	2767960	Also the Dazzlin Darlin AKBK mix, remix by DJ Command, whoever the hell that is.
2767960	2773720	Pop by DJ Taka featuring Kanako Hoshino.
2773720	2777240	Fire Fire by Stripe Gold- That's an awesome name.
2777240	2778560	Fire Fire.
2778560	2780280	Fire Fire.
2780280	2788520	Gold Rush by DJ Yoshitaka-G featuring Michael Alamode.
2788520	2794200	May by Amuro vs. Killer.
2794200	2796720	Second Heaven by Ryustar.
2796720	2802160	She is My Wife by Superstar Mitsuro.
2802160	2805040	Smooch by Korskay.
2805040	2808720	Vanessa by Suzaku.
2808720	2815020	And Yellow Candy by Wrist Junk and Zetta- I love the name of this one- Zetta, The World
2815020	2822120	of Prime Numbers and Transcendental Being by Zettbach.
2822120	2828480	And I'm very surprised to see actually a lot of Japanese tracks in Dance Dance Revolution
2828480	2829480	too.
2829480	2834160	I mean, you might actually have to check that out, I mean with all the songs that they're
2834160	2835160	putting in there.
2835160	2837000	It's amazing considering it's from Japan.
2837000	2841440	But they don't always get licensed in- Not the US version, so see these games, they're
2841440	2847920	coming out, they usually tend to put a lot of licensed stuff in weird old shit.
2847920	2850200	But it's very surprising.
2850200	2852880	Also- Does it have Boom Boom Dollar?
2852880	2855080	I don't know, I haven't looked at the other ones.
2855080	2858400	If it doesn't, then fuck it.
2858400	2864200	Then of course also Dance Dance Revolution X2 Max, they've got the unlocked code, which
2864200	2870760	is unintentionally released, apparently when you name your web pages sequentially, people
2870760	2874800	are gonna figure out, hey, maybe if I change that two to a three, I'm gonna figure out
2874800	2876200	what the next code is.
2876200	2880040	And that's exactly what happened.
2880040	2886880	So apparently the code unlocks the last few songs, which include Poseidon Chorus K Mix
2886880	2894080	by Niope Underground, Kiss Kiss Kiss the AKBK Mix, remixed by DJ Command, Dazzlin Darlin
2894080	2900680	the AKBK Mix, remixed by DJ Command, also from Dance Dance Revolution 2 there.
2900680	2911640	If you were here, the LED G style remix by Jennifer, Kimono Princess by Jun, looks like
2911640	2922200	Roppongi Evolved by Tag Underground, Antimatter by Orbit 1 and Milo, New Decade by Soda F,
2922200	2930960	Possession by Tag Underground, Valkyrie Dimension by Spriggan, May by Amuro vs. the Killer,
2930960	2938420	Pluto the First by Whitewall, and also the weirdly titled Zetta, The World of Prime Numbers
2938420	2944520	and Transcendental Beans by Zetbach and Vanessa by Suzaku.
2944520	2949920	Something called Valkyrie Dimension by Spriggan actually just sounds kinda cool.
2949920	2954240	I was gonna say what, no dropout, but now I'm just wanting to see what Valkyrie Dimension
2954240	2955560	by Spriggan is.
2955560	2961120	Yeah, lots of cool songs, and of course, based on the last list we just read there, a lot
2961120	2966320	of these can be featured in Dance Dance Revolution 2, so it might be worth checking out.
2966320	2970220	And I mean, let's just put it this way, if you don't check it out right away, I can guarantee
2970220	2973880	that the game will probably price drop pretty quick anyways, and it's actually not that
2973880	2979000	expensive going into it, so you know, it might not hurt to check it out.
2979000	2983640	After all these bundles nowadays on the Wii, like the same price as a Playstation 2 DDR
2983640	2989720	game back in the day, so, you know, 50 bucks will get you a dance pad for the Wii and the
2989720	2990720	game.
2990720	2995320	Zeta pointed out that Soda Fujimori also did an awesome Gradius Chance Mix.
2995320	2996320	Yeah.
2996320	3000000	So, just thought that was interesting.
3000000	3001000	That is interesting.
3001000	3006080	All right, and then a little bit of music news here, ReRave, you may remember that game
3006080	3013200	as a pretty awesome iOS game, rhythm music stuff, a little bit of Elite Beat Agents in
3013200	3018080	there with some other stuff, of course being put together by Step Evolution's Kyle Ward
3018080	3020880	and Chris Foy.
3020880	3026400	It is now heading to the arcades, and in fact, the original design, and you can actually
3026400	3030840	see this in the YouTube video that they first put up, actually did call for some sort of
3030840	3037360	like dance mat control type thing, not sure if that's actually going to be included with
3037360	3044200	it, but it's going to include a 42-inch multiplayer touchscreen with a global interactive ranking
3044200	3050480	network according to the press release, and it'd be interesting to see if that actually
3050480	3056440	is going to include, you know, the dance pad or whatever stage, but it is coming to arcades
3056440	3057440	rather soon.
3057440	3065620	Also, Song Pack 15 is out on iOS, including Pegasus by When Machines Dream, and also Rock
3065620	3073240	Robotic by When Dreams Machine, or When Machines Dream, When Dreams Machine, but those are
3073240	3075640	coming out, actually you can get those right now on the iOS.
3075640	3079440	Now, 15 Song Packs, that's just ridiculous.
3079440	3084000	That's a lot more than Konami ever did on any of their Dance Dance Revolution, you know,
3084000	3086000	mixes recently.
3086000	3092240	Alas, well how about something that has nothing to do with DDR?
3092240	3096400	So remember back in 2008, Ubisoft announced that they were going to make a game called
3096400	3101160	I Am Alive, which was like a survival horror game where you're in like a city where there'd
3101160	3105760	been a giant earthquake or a tsunami or something that just obliterated it, and you're trying
3105760	3112200	to survive both against, you know, other people and, you know, a hostile environment and save
3112200	3113840	people and survive.
3113840	3116080	Yeah, that game isn't dead.
3116080	3118560	They're actually just about to release it.
3118560	3120240	It's going to come out this winter.
3120240	3121240	Really?
3121240	3122240	Really.
3122240	3123240	Wow, you don't say.
3123240	3125440	I was amazed when I saw the story.
3125440	3127240	I was like, really?
3127240	3129240	Isn't this like three or four years old?
3129240	3132680	I thought that it was, for some reason I remember that being like a PS1 game.
3132680	3133680	It's not even that old.
3133680	3136960	I mean, it was probably a couple of years ago, because originally it was-
3136960	3137960	It was 2008.
3137960	3138960	Really?
3138960	3144480	I thought it was 2009, because I thought that originally it was supposed to be coming out
3144480	3148680	in March, and then it got pushed back again.
3148680	3150280	But maybe that's March of last year.
3150280	3153400	I just remember that it's like every time they started talking about that game, there
3153400	3157960	was some sort of catastrophe in the world, and they were like, oh, you'd be insensitive
3157960	3159280	to release this game now.
3159280	3160280	Oh, come on.
3160280	3162000	But I guess that- let me finish.
3162000	3165360	But I guess that really what it comes down to is just that the developer couldn't get
3165360	3170320	the game finished, and Ubisoft was like, okay, we'll give you more time.
3170320	3173160	Okay, work on something else instead.
3173160	3175680	And just, it's been back-burnered this whole time.
3175680	3180000	So, if you really want to play like a three and a half year old survival horror game,
3180000	3184120	because you know how great that's going to be, watch for it to be hitting shelves before
3184120	3185120	Christmas.
3185120	3187760	Actually, not shelves at all.
3187760	3189160	Oh, is it a download?
3189160	3190160	It's going to be a downloadable game.
3190160	3192120	Download it off the internet before Christmas.
3192120	3196080	But see, that's great though, because it's not going to be like, you know, fifty bucks
3196080	3197080	or thirty bucks.
3197080	3198920	It's going to be fifteen.
3198920	3200400	I can deal with fifteen.
3200400	3201400	Okay.
3201400	3204360	They should just give it away at this point.
3204360	3205360	Really?
3205360	3206360	Yes.
3206360	3207360	I agree.
3207360	3208360	Free would be perfect.
3208360	3210960	They'd probably sell a few copies.
3210960	3211960	It might be awesome.
3211960	3213600	You know, I'll reserve judgement on this awesomeness.
3213600	3216000	You know what they need to do because of Ubisoft?
3216000	3217520	The cause of the disaster was the Rabbids.
3217520	3219520	Released Beyond Good and Evil 2?
3219520	3222200	The Rabbids.
3222200	3225080	Like you pick up a rock and it's like, AHHH!
3225080	3227080	You're like, oh my god!
3227080	3228080	Look out!
3228080	3229080	It's going to kill me!
3229080	3231000	The zombie Rabbid.
3231000	3234080	And then they'll make a movie out of it and Ubisoft will get out of some of the financial
3234080	3235080	trouble.
3235080	3236080	I'm surprised.
3236080	3238660	I thought that was actually supposed to be a series that was like a primetime comedy
3238660	3241040	series with the Rabbids, but they haven't done it yet.
3241040	3243120	They're kind of, you know, a one-joke character.
3243120	3244120	Who cares?
3244120	3248640	There's a lot of one-joke characters that still have movie after movie after movie.
3248640	3249640	Yeah?
3249640	3256200	I mean, you know, if you're talking about like, well, let's see, any of the dog movies
3256200	3258640	that they have, like Beethoven and they made 8,000-
3258640	3261760	Yeah, yeah, that's true, because they keep making fucking penguin movies.
3261760	3262760	Penguins, yes.
3262760	3264960	It's like, oh dear god!
3264960	3268360	Disclaimer, this was supposed to be rapid fire news, everybody.
3268360	3270240	Okay, uh, shut up.
3270240	3271240	Hey!
3271240	3272240	You shut up.
3272240	3273240	I'm the boss tonight.
3273240	3274240	No you're not.
3274240	3277400	To rapid fire onto the next news story, yeah.
3277400	3282440	You like Rock Band, you like Limp Bizkit, oh, nobody likes Limp Bizkit.
3282440	3287160	Well, if you want to spend ten bucks, you can get, I guess seven bucks if you want to
3287160	3291880	do it as a package, you can get four Limp Bizkit songs in your Rock Band.
3291880	3296200	Gold Cobra, Nookie, My Way, and Rearranged.
3296200	3302160	Plus, they're going to get you for an extra buck if you want pro guitar or bass.
3302160	3304600	Goody goody gumdrops.
3304600	3312920	And in some actually valuable news, the PS3 plays Blu-rays, plays games, it's okay, wait,
3312920	3317760	it's going to validate its existence, because now you can get Chrono Trigger on PSN.
3317760	3319720	There's nothing wrong with another version of Chrono Trigger.
3319720	3324560	I can't think of one bad thing about being able to get Chrono Trigger on the PS3.
3324560	3328160	They could charge 50 bucks for it, and it would still be worth the money.
3328160	3331760	I ain't saying you should spend 50 bucks on Chrono Trigger, but if you did, I wouldn't
3331760	3332760	be like, you're high!
3332760	3336480	I'd be like, high five, Chrono Trigger kicks ass.
3336480	3338880	We should actually play our SNES one again.
3338880	3339880	Yes.
3339880	3340880	Yes.
3340880	3347520	Well, here's some news, this kind of no one cur, but Harvest Moon is going to have a partner
3347520	3349680	with a farm.
3349680	3352920	It's actually the Surrey Docks Farm.
3352920	3360160	So they're basically going to actually link the virtual environment to the real Surrey
3360160	3361520	Docks Farm.
3361520	3368560	So it's official, and that's coming from Gary Jones, who is the farm manager there.
3368560	3372240	He said, we got along really well with the team, and we're very impressed with the Harvest
3372240	3376080	Moon games, since then we stayed in touch and will be looking to work together on future
3376080	3377080	titles.
3377080	3381140	So they are merging real farming with virtual farming.
3381140	3387480	So when you go to milk your cute little cow, somebody's going to be milking a not so cute
3387480	3391640	little, not so little, but cute cow, I guess.
3391640	3392640	So yeah.
3392640	3393640	Farm twinning.
3393640	3399440	And when they run into that tainted beef, you will also get that tainted beef.
3399440	3406560	And Frozen Synapse is a, has a new ha- is bluh bluh bluh, and you know, I would like
3406560	3409760	to be able to speak English without going bluh.
3409760	3410760	Bluh!
3410760	3411760	Shut up.
3411760	3412760	Bluh!
3412760	3413760	Bluh!
3413760	3414760	Bluh!
3414760	3415760	You are not the count.
3415760	3422240	Frozen Synapse is going to star in a new Humble Indie Bundle.
3422240	3423240	Yay!
3423240	3425480	We know what the Humble Indie Bundle is, don't we, Dan?
3425480	3427400	I have no idea what you're talking about.
3427400	3430520	That where you pay what you want, and the money gets donated.
3430520	3432380	I remember reading about that.
3432380	3435600	Didn't like the first time they did that, like 70% of the people just stole the game
3435600	3436600	anyway?
3436600	3437600	No.
3437600	3438600	I don't think so.
3438600	3440480	I think that they can pay a lot of money off of it.
3440480	3441480	Yeah.
3441480	3444040	And it's all, it's all gone to, you know, good causes.
3444040	3445040	So anyway.
3445040	3452200	Um, Frozen Synapse is going to be included in the bundle, and uh, if you pay more than
3452200	3458880	the average price, which is more than $4.27, you also can get, um, Humble Frozen Bite Bundle,
3458880	3463920	which actually includes, uh, Trine Shadowground, Shadowground Survivor, and the cancelled Jack
3463920	3468720	Claw prototype, and pre-order the coming Splott.
3468720	3473920	The money will go to Child's Play and the Electronic Frontier Foundation as you choose.
3473920	3474920	So pretty cool, huh?
3474920	3475920	Pretty cool.
3475920	3476920	Pretty cool.
3476920	3481920	And also, uh, Frozen Synapse is, uh, included on Linux, so that's pretty neat.
3481920	3484720	And last but never least, Persona 4!
3484720	3489120	For all you people who like that weird game, um, there's going to be an anime version that's
3489120	3492120	coming out in the US.
3492120	3498840	And it is, uh, going to be, uh, released in North America and have digital distribution.
3498840	3503440	The DVD and Blu-ray version are going to be out next year, and it premieres in Japan on
3503440	3504440	October 6th.
3504440	3508160	You know, I was completely unaware until I was actually doing a search for, um, I was
3508160	3513640	looking up an item for the new Professor Layton game coming out, and the Professor Layton
3513640	3516280	anime movie is actually coming out over here in November.
3516280	3517280	Really?
3517280	3518280	That's cool.
3518280	3519280	Which is kind of interesting.
3519280	3522040	Well, something that, uh, fans of the series should be interested in too is it's actually
3522040	3527600	got the same art director and the composer, um, Shigenori Soijima and Shouji Meguro.
3527600	3529160	So pretty cool.
3529160	3533360	Have you seen that Konami has, like, a really blatant ripoff of Professor Layton?
3533360	3534360	Yes.
3534360	3537080	Uh, Dr. Lorick and the something or other.
3537080	3538080	I don't remember what it was.
3538080	3539080	I'm going to try to find it.
3539080	3544400	When I first saw it, I was really excited because I thought it was a, uh, a sequel to
3544400	3545400	that doctor.
3545400	3546400	Yeah.
3546400	3547400	Dr. Lorick.
3547400	3548400	Whatever.
3548400	3551560	I thought it was a sequel to that, uh, what was it called?
3551560	3552560	Like Henry Hatsworth?
3552560	3553560	Yeah.
3553560	3554560	Yeah.
3554560	3556440	It was like a side scrolling game that, you know, I played in the store.
3556440	3558720	The guys, everyone was playing in the store and they're just like, you got to try this
3558720	3559720	game when I try this game.
3559720	3561180	Your copy is sitting over there on my desk.
3561180	3563760	This game is fucking amazing.
3563760	3569160	And uh, I saw that and I saw this, this professor allow track and I was like, oh my God, is
3569160	3570160	it a sequel to that?
3570160	3571160	No, no.
3571160	3572160	It's a Professor Layton ripoff.
3572160	3573320	A really obvious one too.
3573320	3576600	Like the guy looks like if he walked up to Professor Layton, they would just be like,
3576600	3577600	what up?
3577600	3578600	Hey, what's going on?
3578600	3581600	And the guy would like twirl his mustache cause he's evil.
3581600	3582600	Okay.
3582600	3586720	Remember when they made like cool original games?
3586720	3587720	No.
3587720	3592040	Didn't they make Frogger at one time?
3592040	3593160	They made Frogger.
3593160	3595080	They made Gradius.
3595080	3598080	They made Castlevania.
3598080	3599080	What the hell?
3599080	3600320	Okay.
3600320	3602480	Let's do another Frogger game for the 3DS.
3602480	3604120	Whoa, hold on.
3604120	3606040	Why are you doing Frogger for the 3DS first?
3606040	3608200	Gradius for the 3DS would be perfect.
3608200	3611520	Dude, they should do Solar Assault for the 3DS.
3611520	3613800	Solar Assault was a 3D Gradius.
3613800	3617120	How about Why Why Konami World?
3617120	3618120	Why?
3618120	3619120	Why?
3619120	3620120	Why?
3620120	3623360	Why Why Konami's Why Why Racing?
3623360	3624360	Ha ha ha.
3624360	3625360	That game was awesome.
3625360	3626360	I know.
3626360	3627360	I don't know.
3627360	3628360	They just...
3628360	3630920	Oh, was that supposed to be the next story anyway?
3630920	3632840	I think that was actually Loki's turn.
3632840	3633840	I have no idea.
3633840	3635240	I'm ready.
3635240	3639240	So let's talk a little bit about Nielsen ratings.
3639240	3640640	I don't agree with them.
3640640	3652240	In fact, they have tapped what they call the top 10 anticipated games for 2011, for the
3652240	3654000	fourth quarter.
3654000	3656800	I'm sorry, but there's a few things missing and a few things I don't agree on.
3656800	3660680	So let's go down the list real quick and I can point that stuff out.
3660680	3665280	Of course, not very obvious, I'm sure.
3665280	3667640	Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 is number one.
3667640	3668640	That makes sense.
3668640	3672680	That's probably the biggest title this year.
3672680	3677880	Number two, and actually this is the top 20 to watch for the holiday of 2011, Gears of
3677880	3678880	War 3.
3678880	3681760	Granted, yes, that's probably a good game.
3681760	3686680	I'm not sure if it's a hugely anticipated game, and this is what they're guessing are
3686680	3688920	going to be the top five titles of the year.
3688920	3694080	Madden NFL 12, that's a no brainer, usually the number one sports game each year.
3694080	3699360	Assassin's Creed Revelations, also kind of a no brainer, kind of expect that to do pretty
3699360	3700360	well.
3700360	3703680	Batman Arkham City, I can see that.
3703680	3708560	The Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword, yeah, that makes sense.
3708560	3713240	Battlefield 3, of course, it's going to be a pretty big title.
3713240	3717920	Just Dance 3, yeah, on the Wii perhaps, I can see that.
3717920	3722480	NBA 2K12, also another good franchise.
3722480	3724440	Game for Speed the Run usually does pretty well.
3724440	3731640	Uncharted 3, Mario and Sonic at the London 2012 Olympic Games, being that that's only
3731640	3736520	on the Wii, I don't know, it's a pretty good third party title for them.
3736520	3739840	Lego Harry Potter years five through seven.
3739840	3744780	FIFA Soccer 12, The Elder Scrolls Skyrim, see that's why I understand, The Elder Scrolls
3744780	3747800	Skyrim is so down that list.
3747800	3750440	That I would see doing a lot better than what they're saying.
3750440	3755360	Dead Island did really well, I could see that maybe being a little higher up the list.
3755360	3759320	Kinect Sports Season 2, now this is where I got to stop them.
3759320	3762560	Yeah the first one did well, but I don't think the second one is going to sell that well
3762560	3763940	at all.
3763940	3769140	Also they have Dance Central 2 on the list, yes, I would hope that the second game will
3769140	3774720	do just as well as the first game, but I don't think that it's going to.
3774720	3778320	Resistance 3, that's a pretty good first party title for Sony.
3778320	3781960	And finally, Deus Ex Human Revolution.
3781960	3784840	Where the fuck is Saints Row the Third on this list?
3784840	3790880	That game is going to do immensely well, but it's just sadly missing.
3790880	3795400	Or there's like a bunch of other games that could be on this list that they're completely
3795400	3796400	overlooking.
3796400	3799480	No one cares about the Nilsons anyway.
3799480	3802160	Yeah I mean, they're just guessing what's going to be in the top five.
3802160	3805280	Nilsons don't even want to acknowledge that Saints Row the Third is going to exist.
3805280	3806280	Let's be honest though.
3806280	3807400	Stick to TV Nilsons.
3807400	3810440	Where the fuck is Grand Theft Auto 5?
3810440	3812440	It's not coming out for a while.
3812440	3814440	Yeah I know.
3814440	3817960	I mean I want to play Saints Row the Third because I want to play Grand Theft Auto 5.
3817960	3819960	I just really really want to.
3819960	3823360	Well Grand Theft Auto 5 will probably be out by about a year's time.
3823360	3828640	I mean because they've already got their first half of 2012 already kind of spoken for.
3828640	3835100	With Max Payne 3 and XCOM I believe are going to be the two games that, well no actually
3835100	3840920	XCOM is 2K but not Rockstar but Max Payne 3 I know is their spring title.
3840920	3844720	Have you seen the trailer for Max Payne 3?
3844720	3848320	It started off and I was really stoked because he had hair.
3848320	3853880	And then he shaved his head and I was like god damn it Max Payne looks stupid bald.
3853880	3856760	It just really bothers me.
3856760	3859440	Is it just because he didn't want to render hair or something like that?
3859440	3860440	I don't know.
3860440	3863920	It's like when Snake was old in Metal Gear Solid 4 that just pissed me off.
3863920	3867120	But then they made it so I could make him look young and I liked playing with him again.
3867120	3870000	I hate it when they make my game heroes look stupid.
3870000	3871840	He did have the Burt Reynolds stash.
3871840	3876880	Oh the Burt Reynolds stash was cool.
3876880	3881800	But yeah I mean they've got Max Payne 3 I know is coming and Agent is supposed to be
3881800	3884140	the other thing that they're working on right now.
3884140	3887920	But Agent got cancelled like a long time ago.
3887920	3889160	No it's still coming.
3889160	3891600	Like I am alive ago.
3891600	3896120	Yeah but L.A. Noire that was also thought to be cancelled for a long time and then eventually
3896120	3897280	came out.
3897280	3900640	Grand Theft Auto 5 I could see probably fourth quarter next year.
3900640	3904240	Agent could make me wait for Grand Theft Auto 5 if it's good.
3904240	3907360	I'm really excited about the possibility of Agent being good.
3907360	3909360	L.A. Noire was awesome.
3909360	3911360	Red Dead Redemption was awesome.
3911360	3915480	You know if they keep bringing me other games to keep me busy I could like wait for GTA
3915480	3916480	5.
3916480	3919920	But it's like seriously I've been dying just to go back and replay the lost and damned.
3919920	3926440	They don't understand how easy it is for them to in the meantime do something.
3926440	3931680	Look at this trend that's going on right now with all these HD remakes of older games.
3931680	3938280	Just take Grand Theft Auto 3 San Andreas San Andreas especially San Andreas.
3938280	3941960	You know give it some HD graphics add multiplayer boom.
3941960	3943760	Who gives a shit about Grand Theft Auto 5.
3943760	3949040	I would pay for those two games just to be imported into the Grand Theft Auto 4 engine.
3949040	3950040	And they've done that.
3950040	3951440	That and that's all they would have to do.
3951440	3956780	But I mean commercially not not as a mod but commercially if they did those games in Grand
3956780	3959080	Theft Auto 4 style I would die.
3959080	3961240	But that's I would pay full price for the remake.
3961240	3966680	I would know you have a mod team of like maybe five people that did it in a couple months.
3966680	3971000	What's it going to what's going to happen when you have Rockstar that has the fucking
3971000	3972480	tools to make these games.
3972480	3975540	They have all the assets to make these games.
3975540	3978780	How long is it going to take a team of like you know.
3978780	3981400	It's like printing fucking money.
3981400	3983960	It's like making your own money for God's sakes.
3983960	3985660	Just release them.
3985660	3990800	Give them to me and I will give you my money.
3990800	3992040	It wouldn't take that much.
3992040	3994400	And seriously they could just piggyback it on the rage engine.
3994400	3998080	Don't have to really tweak anything just piggybacking on what it is now.
3998080	4000040	And people would eat that shit.
4000040	4001040	You're talking like Game of the Year.
4001040	4003240	You're getting to the point where these games.
4003240	4007840	I mean not that not that it's ever going to be you know irrelevant in the video game world.
4007840	4014080	But GTA is kind of losing its relevance because Call of Duty has taken over so big and and
4014080	4018720	people are playing other things and you haven't heard from Grand Theft Auto which was at one
4018720	4022360	time the dominator of the game world.
4022360	4025540	And it's just like where is it at.
4025540	4028280	God damn it.
4028280	4029280	I can't wait.
4029280	4031660	But it's starting to piss me off.
4031660	4035040	See them do an HD San Andreas and it would make sense.
4035040	4037800	It would be amazing just to do that.
4037800	4040680	Because it's great but it's really hard for me to go backwards.
4040680	4042480	Like I had a hard time going back.
4042480	4046800	I mean I played through San Andreas after I played through GTA 4 while I was waiting
4046800	4051680	for the episodes from Liberty City Pack and then I was like well screw this I'll go back
4051680	4054640	now and I'll play Vice City and I couldn't do it.
4054640	4056960	It's just too funky.
4056960	4061040	You know the games the old Grand Theft Auto games were great games for their moment but
4061040	4065240	now they just they don't look very good they don't control very good other than like using
4065240	4069220	cheat codes and running around and just doing messed up stuff.
4069220	4070220	They're not really cool.
4070220	4074440	But you can still go back and play like GTA 4 because GTA 4's got a really good physics
4074440	4075440	engine.
4075440	4077400	You know the driving controls are.
4077400	4080480	But you know it's just it's more fun to run around in.
4080480	4085760	But there's just not as much shit to do as there was in San Andreas.
4085760	4086760	GTA 5.
4086760	4088980	It's like printing money.
4088980	4089980	Is it?
4089980	4090980	Yes.
4090980	4091980	Okay.
4091980	4092980	I believe you.
4092980	4094820	Sort of.
4094820	4097560	Is there more?
4097560	4098560	Battlefield 3.
4098560	4099560	That's almost like printing money.
4099560	4100560	Huh Dan?
4100560	4101560	Oh yeah.
4101560	4102560	Is that my story?
4102560	4103560	Yes.
4103560	4104560	Yay.
4104560	4105560	Battlefield 3.
4105560	4106560	Yeah.
4106560	4107560	Speaking of printing money.
4107560	4108560	Man.
4108560	4109560	Everyone is losing their minds for Battlefield 3.
4109560	4113680	Honestly I'm not even following games that close and I keep hearing about it.
4113680	4118380	Well apparently EA in addition to just paying an ass load of money to once again take a
4118380	4123560	shot at knocking off Call of Duty has decided that it's going to have a Battlefield 3 worldwide
4123560	4132000	conquest tournament in early 2012 with 1.6 million dollars in prizes.
4132000	4133740	That is a lot of prizes.
4133740	4134880	Have you checked out the beta yet?
4134880	4136080	It's free to download now.
4136080	4137960	I have not checked out the beta yet.
4137960	4140980	I'm not really that into FPS's.
4140980	4142300	It takes a very special FPS.
4142300	4143300	I did play.
4143300	4144820	Where was the last Battlefield I played?
4144820	4146500	Bad Company 2.
4146500	4149120	And I actually dug the hell out of that.
4149120	4154820	So I always want to check out the battlefields but they never hooked me honestly.
4154820	4158640	I hate to admit this but I played through the first two Modern Warfares and I want to
4158640	4160700	play through the third Modern Warfare.
4160700	4167300	I just don't want to pay for it because I think Activision needs to be beat to death
4167300	4171860	with a bag of rocks for how hard they fucked Infinity Ward.
4171860	4174720	So I don't know.
4174720	4176700	I'm caught between a rock and a hard place.
4176700	4181940	I'd rather give Microsoft my money by that Halo remake.
4181940	4182940	So we'll see what happens.
4182940	4186940	I'm sure I'll give my hands on it somehow.
4186940	4188420	Possibly.
4188420	4189420	We'll see.
4189420	4194460	Anyways, if you kick ass at Battlefield 3, enter this tournament, win some money, and
4194460	4197220	hook me up for nothing.
4197220	4199460	How about some frivolous lawsuits, huh?
4199460	4200740	And how?
4200740	4208500	Ultimate Pointer has filed patent lawsuits against Nintendo and a damn near bunch of
4208500	4215740	everybody else for its, and I quote, easy deployable interactive direct appointing system
4215740	4218820	and presentation control system and calibration method therefore.
4218820	4220660	I call it my finger.
4220660	4221660	Yeah.
4221660	4225860	But they filed their patent in May of 2005.
4225860	4230580	Although it didn't receive an official status until June 2010, which is four years after
4230580	4233340	the Wii came out, in the US anyway.
4233340	4237340	And they're also suing basically everyone that works with the Wii, like anyone who's
4237340	4240460	done games for the Wii.
4240460	4246000	In fact, it's included retailers who are also involved too in making, using, importing,
4246000	4249860	and or selling of Wii systems, games, and related accessories.
4249860	4251780	Also called the accused products.
4251780	4252780	Ooh.
4252780	4253780	This'll get thrown out.
4253780	4256400	Yeah, this is gonna get completely pissed on by.
4256400	4259980	Big deal that you submitted your application prior, and why did it take them five years
4259980	4265420	is what I want to know, you know, to approve their application for their patent or whatever.
4265420	4272220	But regardless of that, they, they didn't get it approved in time and Nintendo had the
4272220	4273220	first patent.
4273220	4274220	So.
4274220	4275220	Yeah.
4275220	4279700	Well, they're also including like QVC and Tiger Direct, but not Amazon or Newegg.
4279700	4281820	So just pick places at random that sell it.
4281820	4284540	Cause I know that Amazon would just squash them.
4284540	4285540	Yeah.
4285540	4286540	Like Nintendo won't.
4286540	4287540	Oh, QVC.
4287540	4288540	I mean, even.
4288540	4293500	But they're asking, asking that Nintendo of America pay a reasonable royalty due to the
4293500	4294500	alleged infringement.
4294500	4296460	Isn't QVC the home shopping channel?
4296460	4297460	Yes, it is.
4297460	4301140	You ever see the video where the guy was washing the windows and he fell off the ladder?
4301140	4303900	I saw the one where the guy broke a TV with the Wiimote.
4303900	4305260	That's a good one too.
4305260	4306260	Yeah.
4306260	4309740	Watch the QVC video where the guy, he's like up in the, up in the background demonstrating
4309740	4313380	like this ladder and he just falls right off it.
4313380	4315340	It's awesome.
4315340	4318100	People hurting themselves on QVC is cool.
4318100	4322500	I'm glad you think so.
4322500	4325940	Well, how about some FUs of the Week, huh?
4325940	4344780	Because I think that we're angsty people.
4344780	4349860	My FU of the week goes towards hotels near Disneyland for not being cheaper.
4349860	4360900	FU goes to the Superwoman at Subway who doesn't understand how to put together a stand-up
4360900	4361900	drop.
4361900	4363900	Or take instructions.
4363900	4364900	Or turkey.
4364900	4370180	Or give you a cup of Uncharted 3 demo on it.
4370180	4372300	I want an FU to Ultimate Pointer.
4372300	4373300	Fuck those guys.
4373300	4375300	Fuck them right in the ear.
4375300	4376300	Yeah.
4376300	4377300	Fuck them.
4377300	4378300	Fuck them.
4378300	4379300	Okay.
4379300	4382860	We really got our angst up quickly, didn't we?
4382860	4385980	I guess we're not all that pissed because we don't have Rob's soothing voice here to
4385980	4387740	keep us happy, huh?
4387740	4389940	Fuck Rob for that.
4389940	4390940	You know what?
4390940	4392100	Fuck that guy.
4392100	4393900	You like Rob.
4393900	4396980	And fuck the people who keep making Penguin movies too.
4396980	4398220	God damn.
4398220	4401760	I was at the movie theater the other day and I mean I was there to see The Lion King 3D
4401760	4405620	so you'd expect that I'm gonna see this but I saw the commercial for Happy Feet 2 fucking
4405620	4408060	twice and once was enough.
4408060	4409060	Dear God.
4409060	4412400	Did it really need a sequel?
4412400	4413400	Fuck Penguin movies.
4413400	4415900	So do we have any more news, Loki?
4415900	4416900	Fucking Penguin movies.
4416900	4417900	Yes.
4417900	4421580	In fact, I'm gonna talk a little bit and since we normally try to put a dirty story towards
4421580	4425660	the end of all of our shows or at least I try to put a dirty story at the end of all
4425660	4430960	of our shows, we're gonna talk a little bit about pornography because that's fun.
4430960	4439780	So there's this new video, I guess if you will, called Geek Girls the Gamers and of
4439780	4445240	course it is one of these genre porn videos that they're aiming towards people that play
4445240	4450100	video games because you know, guys that play video games, they like watching pornography.
4450100	4452460	I mean that kind of goes hand in hand.
4452460	4458220	Of course, you know, they've got a few people in there that they're claiming, oh I love
4458220	4461900	games and stuff like that but then they've got actually some hardcore people that have
4461900	4466620	you know, the Zelda tattoos and button tattoos and all crazy shit like that which is a little
4466620	4472100	bit more believable but like, you know, rather than the one time my boyfriend played a game
4472100	4474740	and it was just fun.
4474740	4483240	Anyways, so yeah, if you're interested, it is coming out quite soon from New Sensations
4483240	4491140	and it's Geek Girls the Gamers, yes if that's not ridiculous enough like the Playboy spreads
4491140	4492140	that they do.
4492140	4500000	But this at least has actual people in it instead of you know, Photoshop, CG, fake characters
4500000	4502260	that are topless.
4502260	4506020	Kids like boobs, especially nursing children.
4506020	4507020	Yeah.
4507020	4510180	Remember BMX Triple X?
4510180	4511180	Yes!
4511180	4513300	That game was awesomely bad.
4513300	4514300	It was awesome!
4514300	4516780	No, no, no, it was awesomely bad.
4516780	4520660	It was like Dave Mira freestyle BMX 2 but you could be naked.
4520660	4524620	But no, it was an awesome game because, not necessarily because of that, because of all
4524620	4529060	the missions that they would give you like, you would have to, it's like ridiculous shit
4529060	4533800	like okay, you're gonna have to pull off some tricks to get this dog horny so they'll go
4533800	4535320	fuck another dog.
4535320	4537940	That's literally one of the missions in the first level of the game.
4537940	4539980	That is like one of like the first missions.
4539980	4545040	And then another one where you have to deliver, you know, hose to, you know, their clients
4545040	4546040	using your bike.
4546040	4547040	On the back of your bike.
4547040	4548040	I remember that one.
4548040	4549260	On the back of your BMX bike.
4549260	4550360	You know what was great about that?
4550360	4554260	Just go to the cheat code, enter champagne room, and then you can watch all the titty
4554260	4555360	videos.
4555360	4556460	It's that simple.
4556460	4557460	There you go.
4557460	4561980	And then you could go play Matt Hoffman because Matt Hoffman was just a better game.
4561980	4562980	I liked that game.
4562980	4564120	I thought it was pretty good.
4564120	4570060	It was ironic though that the PlayStation 2 and GameCube versions were uncensored but,
4570060	4572880	or it was like the Xbox and GameCube versions were uncensored.
4572880	4573880	But the...
4573880	4575040	I don't know about the GameCube version.
4575040	4578360	I know that they, I know that they gave me like an Xbox version.
4578360	4582140	The GameCube one was uncensored because that's what I had it on.
4582140	4587940	And they did some like girl family sue after the fact because she was, no that was...
4587940	4588940	Dave Mira Sue.
4588940	4589940	Girls Gone Wild.
4589940	4590940	No, that was the um...
4590940	4592380	That was the Girls Gone Wild, wasn't it?
4592380	4593380	The guy game.
4593380	4594380	What was it?
4594380	4595380	Yeah.
4595380	4596380	I don't even remember him being sued.
4596380	4599180	It was just that some underage girl managed to sneak into it.
4599180	4601340	And then they were like, you can't sell that game anymore.
4601340	4602700	I'm like, that's fine.
4602700	4606740	We weren't selling it to start with.
4606740	4610420	So one more story and then we're going to open up the Skyplane.
4610420	4611420	Sounds good.
4611420	4612420	Oh sure.
4612420	4618880	So apparently Microsoft is looking into auto mature filtering options.
4618880	4621580	I don't really understand what I'm reading here.
4621580	4624940	I guess they did it a while ago where you can go ahead and set the games up so they
4624940	4626980	won't be quite as mature.
4626980	4630000	Which I think honestly is a pretty decent idea.
4630000	4633280	Because you know, you really want to make Gears of War a little warmer and more cuddly
4633280	4635700	so your eight year old can play it.
4635700	4637120	Really?
4637120	4639820	They ought to make that game two ways.
4639820	4643580	Violent and ultra violent.
4643580	4649060	Now this is not part of a show rule but did you notice there was a story this week someone
4649060	4653900	that actually built a full size Lancer out of Legos.
4653900	4655660	It's like really?
4655660	4658060	That dude is my hero.
4658060	4659060	And it works.
4659060	4660860	We were a two Lancer family at one time.
4660860	4664940	No no, not Mitsubishi Lancer you dork.
4664940	4666140	The gun from Gears of War.
4666140	4671020	I know I was being silly.
4671020	4675860	I'm opening the Skyplane now because I'm tired of listening to Dan.
4675860	4676860	You live with me.
4676860	4678340	You have to listen to me all the time.
4678340	4680140	I could just go back to Rob's house.
4680140	4684700	Kijuto brings up, they were talking about Road Rash real quick.
4684700	4689180	That was one of those games, remember it was the Burnout team, Criterion I think was actually
4689180	4690180	going to put out a new version.
4690180	4692180	Oh my god, that would be amazing.
4692180	4694180	The video was fucking amazing.
4694180	4697220	You said they were going to or they are going to.
4697220	4698820	Why would they not do that?
4698820	4700880	They work for EA.
4700880	4701880	This needs to happen.
4701880	4703460	Does anybody know someone at EA?
4703460	4704460	Yes.
4704460	4705460	For the record.
4705460	4707100	It's like don't have them make more Need for Speeds.
4707100	4709740	For god sakes, have Criterion make a Road Rash.
4709740	4711140	In fact, fuck that noise.
4711140	4714380	Why isn't Criterion making a new Burnout?
4714380	4722980	So the Skyplane is open, the number is 1-877-GAME-OLR or see us on Skype at Orange Lounge Radio.
4722980	4726060	Because we're awesome.
4726060	4732940	Until then, I'm going to read some of our very few tinky Twitter topics.
4732940	4736740	But I don't want to use whatever song that, oh we actually have a caller.
4736740	4737740	So I will answer this first.
4737740	4740940	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
4740940	4742540	Hey, it's CD Thunder.
4742540	4747100	Hi CD Thunder, what do you have for us today?
4747100	4750980	I have a couple things to discuss tonight.
4750980	4751980	Okay.
4751980	4755540	I, first off, I'd like to talk a little bit about Contra.
4755540	4756540	Okay.
4756540	4759340	Contra is so awesome.
4759340	4767860	I've played the first Contra a little bit, but I just wanted to actually get your guys'
4767860	4772140	opinions on Contra.
4772140	4776180	Contra is if you really hate yourself and want to be defeated at every turn.
4776180	4781140	Yeah, I mean, it was really hard because I couldn't even get past the first level without
4781140	4783780	dying like five or six times.
4783780	4784780	Practice.
4784780	4786660	Contra is not very difficult.
4786660	4792540	Well, it's only hard, it's not hard if you know how to play it.
4792540	4794820	I really don't know how.
4794820	4796740	So what was your other topic?
4796740	4799740	Play the Contra on the Super NES.
4799740	4800740	Say what?
4800740	4802140	What was your second topic?
4802140	4806580	Oh, it's about Metal Slug.
4806580	4807980	I love Metal Slug.
4807980	4811140	I like Camel Slug.
4811140	4819020	Saw the Orange Sons Radio YouTube video that showed the inside of your vault.
4819020	4822500	And I noticed they had a copy of Metal Slug Anthology.
4822500	4824300	Yes, we do.
4824300	4825300	Indeed.
4825300	4829420	And a bunch of other different Metal Slugs somewhere on various things.
4829420	4832260	Ironically, not my own, no Metal Slug for the actual Neo Geo.
4832260	4833260	Metal Slug, I really like that.
4833260	4836980	I mean, it's really basic.
4836980	4840580	All you do is you have a character and you go around killing people.
4840580	4843660	I mean, how can it get any more basic?
4843660	4846260	Do you have a copy of Metal Slug Anthology?
4846260	4848140	No, I don't actually.
4848140	4851940	You shouldn't get one.
4851940	4852940	It's really epic.
4852940	4857380	It's worth owning if you're a fan of run and gun games.
4857380	4860900	Basically all the Contras, all the Metal Slugs are just the best run and gun games you can
4860900	4861900	get.
4861900	4865380	You know, if you go out and buy them and play them, you will be happy.
4865380	4867500	And happiness is what you want, right?
4867500	4869740	Yeah, pretty much.
4869740	4870740	Happiness in game form.
4870740	4873300	Kill all who oppose you.
4873300	4874300	Words to live by.
4874300	4875300	Yeah.
4875300	4876300	Got anything else for us tonight?
4876300	4879260	Yeah, a couple last minute things.
4879260	4880260	Okay.
4880260	4884620	I'd like to talk about two of my favorite games to play in the arcade.
4884620	4887340	How about one of your favorite games, because we've got to let other callers come in.
4887340	4893060	Okay, one of my favorite arcade games to play was, I'm not sure if you've heard of this
4893060	4894060	one, it's called CarnEvil.
4894060	4895060	Yes, I know CarnEvil.
4895060	4896060	That game was awful.
4896060	4897060	That game sucks balls.
4897060	4900220	Why don't you like it?
4900220	4901220	I liked it.
4901220	4902220	Because it was awful.
4902220	4903220	It's just real.
4903220	4904220	It's a gun game.
4904220	4905700	It wasn't very challenging either.
4905700	4906700	It wasn't a good gun game.
4906700	4907700	And I hate clowns.
4907700	4908700	Well, for me, it wasn't.
4908700	4909700	For other people, it wasn't.
4909700	4910700	But I'm glad that you like it.
4910700	4911700	But it was very gory.
4911700	4912700	It's very popular.
4912700	4913700	That's all I really remember.
4913700	4914700	You see those machines everywhere.
4914700	4917820	I think that I hate clowns so much that I didn't even enjoy shooting them.
4917820	4918820	You love clowns.
4918820	4919820	Shut up.
4919820	4920820	Oh, okay.
4920820	4921820	Yeah, I can understand that.
4921820	4922820	Yeah.
4922820	4923820	All right, well, thanks for giving us a call today, CD Thunder.
4923820	4924820	All right, thank you.
4924820	4925820	I'm going.
4925820	4926820	Thanks for listening.
4926820	4927820	Thank you.
4927820	4928820	All right.
4928820	4931660	So I sent Jamie real quick, because I know this is going to make amazing radio, that
4931660	4936900	trailer for the new Road Rash game.
4936900	4941540	It's a pre-visual thing that this guy is working on.
4941540	4952740	Dude, so we have a bike, and the life bar is a chain going to the deformed skull.
4952740	4953740	Dude, that dude kicked a van.
4953740	4954740	Now, kick him.
4954740	4955740	Kick him.
4955740	4956740	Kick him.
4956740	4957740	Kick him.
4957740	4958740	Kick him.
4958740	4959740	In the face.
4959740	4960740	Oh, oh, dude, he's grappling him.
4960740	4961740	Oh, you should have pushed him into that car.
4961740	4962740	I would buy like five copies of this.
4962740	4963740	Oh, gato.
4963740	4964740	Oh, you can see that some of the cars are untextured, so yeah.
4964740	4965740	Well, yeah, it's all free bits.
4965740	4966740	Yeah, the whole world's untextured.
4966740	4967740	Unless he's riding a bicycle.
4967740	4968740	That's pretty cool.
4968740	4969740	All right, well, hey, we got another call today.
4969740	4989460	So we're going to put this up on our tumbler, how's that sound?
4989460	4994620	I detect so much madness.
4994620	4996740	Hello, this is Orange Jones Radio, who's this?
4996740	4998740	Hey, it's the one and only Ronma.
4998740	4999740	Ron.
4999740	5000740	Hi.
5000740	5001740	How are you?
5001740	5002740	Good.
5002740	5003740	I'm doing good.
5003740	5004740	How about you?
5004740	5005740	I'm kind of wishing Rob was here.
5005740	5010740	Now, before I continue, I have to tell everyone in the chat room, take two drinks.
5010740	5011740	Why?
5011740	5017260	Well, there is a drinking game where everyone has to do like one or two shots when I call
5017260	5018260	in, so.
5018260	5019260	Oh, yeah.
5019260	5020260	Well, we've got apple wine.
5020260	5021260	Does that count?
5021260	5022260	Good enough.
5022260	5023260	Okay.
5023260	5025740	Well, no, I think I've got like some vodka left over from three years ago.
5025740	5026740	I don't think so.
5026740	5032100	I had a bottle of root beer flavored vodka in my cabinet, went looking for it the other
5032100	5037100	day and it was empty and I realized my other friend who was the local Jack Daniels guy
5037100	5038100	drank it.
5038100	5039100	Fucking lush.
5039100	5040100	Fun.
5040100	5043540	And for the record, we do have that vanilla vodka on top of the fridge that I got for
5043540	5046780	the party and no one ever opened, like my birthday three years ago.
5046780	5047780	What?
5047780	5048780	Nice.
5048780	5049780	It's still there?
5049780	5050780	Okay.
5050780	5051780	So, hi.
5051780	5052780	What's up?
5052780	5053780	I think I drank that when you weren't looking.
5053780	5054780	You don't drink.
5054780	5055780	I drink the shit out of that vodka.
5055780	5056780	I was like, clang.
5056780	5062740	He has, if he had one shot, he would be red in the face and sitting on the couch falling
5062740	5063740	asleep.
5063740	5064740	That's not true.
5064740	5065740	That is, okay, two shots.
5065740	5068740	Oh, probably wouldn't even take one.
5068740	5069740	See?
5069740	5071740	So, Dan's a lush?
5071740	5072740	No.
5072740	5073740	Dan's not.
5073740	5074740	Jamie's a lush.
5074740	5075740	Dan's not a very good alcoholic.
5075740	5079780	Well, Jamie, you and Patty would have fun together.
5079780	5085340	I'd like to come out to your neck of the woods and go drinking with you and Patty.
5085340	5087220	That means y'all will be raiding my liquor cabinet.
5087220	5088220	Not that I would be complaining.
5088220	5089220	Oh my God, no.
5089220	5091580	You'd be contributing to your liquor cabinet and getting you good beer.
5091580	5095220	See, that's why I have parties, to get rid of the alcohol.
5095220	5098580	At the end of the night, I open up the cab and I'm like, where did all of this come from?
5098580	5101220	Well, that's why for my birthday I have the beer potluck.
5101220	5102220	Ah.
5102220	5103220	Mm.
5103220	5107680	So, so how about the show so far, huh?
5107680	5108820	So far, so good.
5108820	5112180	I give it three out of four train wrecks.
5112180	5113180	Okay.
5113180	5114820	So we're not a derpisode fully?
5114820	5115820	We're a minor derp.
5115820	5116820	Far from derp.
5116820	5118860	What are you talking about?
5118860	5119860	That's my podcast.
5119860	5121060	We're the derpy ones.
5121060	5122700	We can derail under five minutes.
5122700	5127380	Any show that I appear on for the whole show is immediately awesome.
5127380	5132100	I've just been letting them get out there testosteroneing, so it's been cool.
5132100	5133100	Fair enough.
5133100	5135860	So what else is on your mind?
5135860	5141440	Well, I think it was last weekend, I believe, it was me, Patty, and Ziba.
5141440	5146740	We went down to the Jersey Shore as Ziba played us to a classic arcade.
5146740	5147740	Really?
5147740	5148740	Oh, so cool.
5148740	5149740	Yeah.
5149740	5151300	So what all did they have in the classic arcade?
5151300	5153700	Like, were there tons of pins?
5153700	5154700	Quit acting like you care about classic arcade games.
5154700	5155700	There were some.
5155700	5156700	I think I sent you a couple of pictures.
5156700	5157700	I did.
5157700	5158700	They're set up.
5158700	5159700	What did you play?
5159700	5160700	I...
5160700	5161700	Okay, what did you play?
5161700	5162700	Okay, I played Super Mario Brothers.
5162700	5163700	Oh, nice.
5163700	5165660	First, the Super Mario Brothers is a cool machine.
5165660	5166980	Yeah.
5166980	5170860	I was kind of pissed that there was no gauntlet machine, because I put quarters in it like
5170860	5171860	nobody else's business.
5171860	5173220	That and Ninja Turtles.
5173220	5175500	Yeah, those are both really good.
5175500	5176500	Sweet.
5176500	5178060	They're much, much better if you have friends, though.
5178060	5182460	Four player gauntlet, I could spend like five bucks on without even realizing that I did
5182460	5183460	it.
5183460	5184460	Yeah.
5184460	5185840	You just never wanted to quit playing.
5185840	5187020	As long as your friends were still in it.
5187020	5190540	I would give other people quarters so that they would keep playing.
5190540	5193540	That was what it was like playing Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, though.
5193540	5197220	You know, when you were close to the end of the game and you really wanted to make it.
5197220	5198580	It's like, here, take my tokens.
5198580	5199580	Cool.
5199580	5201980	Ninja Turtles, though, got harder when you had more people.
5201980	5202980	It was great.
5202980	5204240	Gauntlet actually got easier.
5204240	5205740	You could last longer.
5205740	5209540	Oh, you got me thinking of Gauntlet 2 for Nintendo.
5209540	5211220	I thought I had beat that game.
5211220	5214060	After 150 levels, I said, the hell with it and walked away.
5214060	5218420	You know, I never got Gauntlet 2 on the NES, and I really wish that I had, because it's
5218420	5220740	actually kind of a cool little version.
5220740	5226540	I do have Gauntlet 4 for the Genesis, which is basically Gauntlet 1 for the Genesis, and
5226540	5231820	it's got a quest mode, and it's actually four players if you have a multitap, but I've never
5231820	5233660	managed to get four people on it at once.
5233660	5235380	It's one of the failures of my life.
5235380	5238060	Well, I can get you a copy of Gauntlet 2.
5238060	5239060	That's not too hard.
5239060	5240620	I don't really need one at this point.
5240620	5244540	I'm just saying, I never picked it up back in the day, and watching videos and stuff
5244540	5250860	of it later on, I kind of wish that I had, because it looks like it was pretty choice.
5250860	5251860	Indeed it was.
5251860	5253380	I wish I had picked up the strategy guide for it.
5253380	5254380	Oh, well.
5254380	5255380	It is what it is.
5255380	5259140	So, there were pinball tables there, though, right?
5259140	5260140	Yes.
5260140	5263940	One of my friends, Ari, he was playing pinball while I was chucking quarters into a theater
5263940	5266220	of magic machine.
5266220	5269460	Theater of magic is awesome.
5269460	5276460	And then I left that, and I went to play this large, old-school Atari pinball machine.
5276460	5277460	Was it Hercules?
5277460	5278460	Yes, it was.
5278460	5279460	Yes.
5279460	5280460	Ah.
5280460	5281660	Someone in chat mentioned Hercules.
5281660	5283380	I've never played a Hercules machine.
5283380	5285900	I've seen the back glass, for one.
5285900	5289780	It took me five minutes, like five tries to figure out how to play this stupid thing,
5289780	5292820	because I'm pulling it back thinking all I got to do is send it forward.
5292820	5298900	No, I got to push back and shove it forth like a plunger to send the ball rolling.
5298900	5306940	Well, that sounds like, you know, something just makes me think that I have seen one before,
5306940	5307940	though, at one of the pinball.
5307940	5312020	Didn't they have one at one of the pinball things we went to, Dan?
5312020	5313020	I thought that they did.
5313020	5314420	Did they have a Hercules?
5314420	5315420	I don't think.
5315420	5316420	No, they just had that giant-
5316420	5318220	It was just a giant mockup.
5318220	5327060	Yeah, that used a pool cue, a cue ball for the pin, for the pinball.
5327060	5328140	It's kind of funny.
5328140	5329140	That sounds pretty cool.
5329140	5332620	It was pretty cool, but it got boring after five minutes, because I could not reach from
5332620	5337500	one side to the other very easily, because my short arms.
5337500	5344420	So anything else, like how classic was classic, was it just like that 80s era, or did it get
5344420	5350980	into the later 90s, or was it just like early 80s to mid-90s?
5350980	5355860	The only machine in this one section that was current was a DDR Max II machine.
5355860	5359620	Oh, you can't have an arcade without a DDR, shoved in the summer.
5359620	5366500	Everything else was just pure 80s, there was a Tapper machine, there was Frogger, no Super
5366500	5369780	Sprint, there was Iron Man off-road floating around there, too.
5369780	5370780	Hey, cool.
5370780	5371980	Well, that's pretty awesome.
5371980	5376140	I'm going to have to check that place out if I can ever get to your neck of the woods.
5376140	5380260	Well, I think I have a large enough box to ship you in.
5380260	5382200	I'm fragile.
5382200	5384100	I will make sure of that.
5384100	5385100	Fragile.
5385100	5386880	Well, I'll think about it.
5386880	5391300	Let me wait until this semester's over, and then I'll see if I can be shipped.
5391300	5392300	Fair enough.
5392300	5397180	I think Patty would love that, because she's about to spaz at her job, so...
5397180	5399620	I've been hearing.
5399620	5402300	Yeah, she's now an assistant manager.
5402300	5406060	I feel very sorry for her.
5406060	5407740	That makes two of us.
5407740	5408740	Yeah.
5408740	5411620	Well, you got anything else for us tonight?
5411620	5412780	Um...
5412780	5415940	Actually, no, that's it.
5415940	5416940	All right.
5416940	5417940	Well...
5417940	5420800	Ronma, before you go, I want you to do something for me.
5420800	5421800	That being?
5421800	5422800	That being black.
5422800	5426060	No, no, no, I don't stay black anymore.
5426060	5427060	That's not my style.
5427060	5428060	Hey!
5428060	5429060	What the fuck did I say?
5429060	5430060	Stay black!
5430060	5431060	No, I stay nerdy, man!
5431060	5432060	Stay nerdy!
5432060	5433060	Stay that, too.
5433060	5434060	Keep it nerdy, motherfucker.
5434060	5435060	Keep it nerdy.
5435060	5436060	All right.
5436060	5437060	Okay.
5437060	5438060	Thanks for calling in.
5438060	5439060	All right.
5439060	5440060	Bye, Ronchan.
5440060	5441060	Bye.
5441060	5442060	Stay black.
5442060	5443060	Bye.
5443060	5444060	All right.
5444060	5445060	We will take a couple more calls.
5445060	5446060	It's 1-877-AGAMEOLR.
5446060	5452140	And then we'll go ahead and see what is on our Twitter.
5452140	5459660	We have a mention from Niconicochan that says tweet heart.
5459660	5466340	Tigerclaw sends us a story about Dota 2 wants you.
5466340	5467420	Are you ready?
5467420	5474700	And that's a big fan wanting a beta key that they put up a sign.
5474700	5476860	So that's kind of interesting.
5476860	5479180	He paid $3,000 for an electronic billboard.
5479180	5480180	That's pretty crazy.
5480180	5481180	He didn't actually pay $3,000.
5481180	5482180	That's just photoshopped?
5482180	5483180	No, no.
5483180	5486980	What ended up happening is it would have cost him $3,000 to normally rent one of those signs
5486980	5487980	for a month.
5487980	5490300	He actually called Clear Channel in this case.
5490300	5491300	Oh, yeah.
5491300	5492300	And got it for free.
5492300	5493300	Yeah.
5493300	5494300	Got it for free.
5494300	5495300	Because they were only running it for an hour.
5495300	5496300	It was part of their...
5496300	5497300	Because that's one of those digital billboards.
5497300	5498540	So you could just take a picture of it.
5498540	5501340	So he took a picture of it with his friends.
5501340	5503780	Because it's a picture contest to get keys.
5503780	5504780	Oh, I see.
5504780	5506700	Well, that's pretty cool.
5506700	5508140	The links people will go to.
5508140	5510740	Guys, we're taking one more call.
5510740	5513440	So that's 1877-GAME-OLR.
5513440	5519340	We also have another one from Tigerclaw about Gotham City Impostors beta beginning on October
5519340	5521540	5th.
5521540	5524340	And that's a PC game.
5524340	5525900	Weird.
5525900	5529020	And Steam codes have already been mailed out to those who are accepted.
5529020	5532540	And the client can be downloaded now, but the beta will not begin until next week.
5532540	5533540	So yay.
5533540	5534540	Any more calls?
5534540	5538460	So nobody else wants to call and talk to Dan?
5538460	5539460	They're afraid of you.
5539460	5540940	They're intimidated by your awesomeness.
5540940	5543280	Fuck you guys.
5543280	5544900	Someone called Dan so I don't have to...
5544900	5545900	No, no, no.
5545900	5548180	I don't even want to talk to anyone anymore.
5548180	5549780	Now you should extra call him.
5549780	5553100	All right, well, I'm closing the Skype line.
5553100	5556020	Yeah, fuck the Skype line.
5556020	5557860	They're intimidated by you, I swear.
5557860	5560460	You know, I can't blame them.
5560460	5561780	I'm not intimidated by you.
5561780	5568860	I am quite the imposing presence when I roll into the O.L.R. like, what?
5568860	5569860	Yeah.
5569860	5574500	Well, I guess since that's it, that's pretty much the show.
5574500	5576220	So how about...
5576220	5580660	And I'm not going to do a fortune cookie tonight either, so...
5580660	5581660	No fortune cookie?
5581660	5582660	No.
5582660	5583660	All I have to do is that.
5583660	5584660	Because it's a derpisode and I don't care.
5584660	5591940	You should just play the quartet song again.
5591940	5592940	Okay.
5592940	5593940	I'll play the quartet song again.
5593940	5594940	How's that sound?
5594940	5596740	The quartet of loop in the future.
5596740	5601940	But because you have all asked for it, I will be doing about 30 minutes to an hour of pump
5601940	5602940	up volume.
5602940	5604500	So stay tuned after the show.
5604500	5605500	Nobody asked for that.
5605500	5606500	Yes, they did.
5606500	5607500	Shut up.
5607500	5608500	That's like torture on the radio.
5608500	5610020	No, it is not.
5610020	5611020	Everyone thinks it's completely awesome.
5611020	5613580	I can't help it if you are torture on the damn radio.
5613580	5616300	I'm from God.
5616300	5618300	You are punishment.
5618300	5619300	For you.
5619300	5620860	I love you.
5620860	5623340	Rob's back next week, just reminding everybody.
5623340	5626700	I know you guys are excited that Rob will be back.
5626700	5628180	I love having you on the show.
5628180	5629180	It's great.
5629180	5630180	It sucks.
5630180	5631180	Wouldn't you guys rather have me here than Jamie?
5631180	5633020	Rob does not suck on the air.
5633020	5634580	Jamie doesn't even really talk.
5634580	5635900	Yes I do.
5635900	5637180	You have been fucking...
5637180	5640980	I could totally be on the show and you guys would almost not even notice that Jamie was
5640980	5643060	gone.
5643060	5644060	I have to...
5644060	5647820	She looks so mad she can barely talk.
5647820	5651880	I wish I would have had a picture of the look on her face a minute ago.
5651880	5655540	Someone has to watch the chat room and it's usually me because I'm the only one that can
5655540	5661140	keep all of these rowdy people under some semblance of not kicking each other all over
5661140	5662460	the place with trouts.
5662460	5664260	Dude, all the people are like cool.
5664260	5665260	They are cool.
5665260	5666420	They have no problem in there.
5666420	5668540	You're just playing Warcraft.
5668540	5670380	I do not play Warcraft during the show, Dan.
5670380	5673100	That's why the band is going to suck.
5673100	5675220	I can stream video while you guys do the show.
5675220	5678060	It's really hard to play the board when I play that bitch.
5678060	5679060	You know what?
5679060	5680060	What?
5680060	5681060	End of the show!
5681060	5682060	Bye everybody!
5682060	5683060	Goodnight!
5683060	5684060	Stay black!
