I'm back after a little bit of a vacation
Joy
My name is
Stop trying to sound so hurt about it
My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining over the next few hours with my sometimes questionable co-host
Hi
Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers
You know, it's almost as if you never left, we had such a derpy
I heard about the derpisodes while I was gone
Yes, we called them derpisodes
I haven't heard, just like the podcast listeners which I apologize for in advance, I haven't heard last week's
But I heard about half of the one from two weeks ago on the commute to work
The one from two weeks ago was like two minutes
Yeah, you guys just flew through the news
And I did like a bajillion hours to pump up the volume
Not tonight though, oh my god we have a huge show tonight
We have like big announcements, big stuff to talk about tonight
Of course I have to introduce the other guy here on the show, say hello to tech master Loki
And I'll have you know for the record, I'm always questionable
What?
I can't wait to hear your last one
Oh you can be questionable, I'll just be questioning
Huh?
What?
Huh?
Why?
Why?
Why?
Okay, so yeah, I've been gone for a couple weeks
And I gotta say, at first I apologize, especially the podcast folks
Because the podcast feed is behind a week right now and that's pretty much my fault
I've been extremely busy
Now I know what you're gonna think though, like yeah, the reason why I miss the shows
I went to a rock concert two weeks ago
Look, it's a band I've missed like three times
And I said I am seeing Lady Tron this time come hell or high water
And it rocked
But they only want you when you're 17
And then last week, when you're 21 you're no fun
Last week I went to Disneyland, I know rough life right
But I came back to just craziness at work
And I had this performance I was doing last night
I participated in a local production of Repo the genetic opera
Yes the movie, they do shadow casting for that now a la Rocky Horror
Which as you guys may or may not know, Rocky Horror is kind of the reason
I got into podcasting in the first place
Because Rocky Horror led to Undersedation Live
The show I used to be on led to this show
So I still support actively the Rocky Horror community
And this show leads to neurosis
I can talk about this now
There actually was a surprise cameo of the song Sweet Transvestite in Repo
So I played Riff Raff on stage but I had to keep it a secret
I wanted to tell people I couldn't because it was all a surprise
And the crowd went wild and it was a great show man
When they did some of the killing scenes
They did that whole thing where the blood sprays out in the audience
Over the first five rows, it was awesome
So big kudos to the folks here in SAC that made that happen
And my friend played Blind Mag
Yes, she was phenomenal
She was really good
Oh my gosh, I loved her, she was as they would say, fierce
I didn't get to go last night, I wanted to
But she has that dramatic quality in life
And I don't want to ruin the movie too much
But it's been out a few years now
She has a pretty dramatic death scene that's very over the top
And just awesome to watch
So, anyhow
Only good role Sarah Silverman has ever done
Wait, you mean Sarah Brightman?
Sarah Brightman, why does it say Silverman?
Sarah Brightman
Keep in mind
Were you thinking of your fellow Jews? Is that what it was?
I guess so
Yom Kippur has taken over your life
But Sarah Brightman, I've made no secret of this
I think she's way too brassy as a soprano
And I know that Christine was for her for Phantom of the Opera
But you know what?
Hate her in it, hate her, hate her, hate her, hate her
But she was really, really good as Blind Mag
Yes, I agree
And to bring this back to games
Repo, even though some people don't really like it as a movie
And say it's a terrible movie, because it is a little weird
It's the guy who did Saw doing a rock opera
And like opera, meaning everything is a song
But Tony Head
Anthony's to her head
Hello
And it's told in that kind of comic book style
And it's just neat, it's something you should see
Anyhow
And they should make a game out of it
Back to video games for a minute
Obviously this has been like everywhere this week
But we have to mention it, we have to
Steve Jobs passed away this week
And it's kind of one of those things, it's insanely sad
I know it's all been all over CNN
And especially all over Twitter and Facebook and so forth
I know you guys have heard a lot about it
But how could we not tip our hat to Steve Jobs
And obviously, he did a lot for podcasting
He didn't invent podcasting
But definitely what happened with iTunes
Propelled it into the stratosphere
And we have a lot to thank for that, for the exposure
And plus, it was called podcasting in the beginning
Even before iTunes, because
And we were actually doing a show back before iTunes
That's how long the show's been going on
Your old RSS would kind of
You could get these programs that would actually
Still sync them to your iPod
Because they weren't iPhones back then, but iPods
And you kind of sync it that way
And so there were ways to do what iTunes was doing before that
But it was always designed with that portable
On the go thing in mind
I think it's important to mention, Steve Jobs contributed a lot
To things that don't even start with an eye
So regardless to how you feel about Apple
Well, okay, I got one Apple thing I gotta say though
Is that him and Woz did the Apple IIe
That was a huge thing
And that was like, hello childhood school
In the garage
Well, the original Apple was in the garage
But yeah, that leads to Apple II
Which is what we all, like anybody who grew up in the 80s
We all did
How many of us played Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego
On one of those rectangular bricks?
Or Oregon Trail
Or Math Blasters
You know, that was a huge part of our education
And I think, you know, to me it was always like
Really looking forward to Computer Lab Day
I'm sure you other nerds feel the same way, right?
It was just like, Computer Lab Day was awesome
We didn't have computers in Alabama
Really? Oh
No, we had like
I actually believed you for a minute
We actually had one Apple IIe in the library
Which I would just go play all the time
And then we had like the tall brick Macs
You know what I mean?
Right
At a couple of the facilities that I used to do volunteer work at
And if it wasn't for him, we wouldn't have the MacBook
And we wouldn't have been able to upload the virus to the alien mothership
To save the world on Independence Day
Absolutely, absolutely
Very important contribution is that Steve Jobs
Did contribute to saving us from virus
Virus, Mac OS, same thing
Even back in the day
The first really good graphics programs were developed on Mac
And that's why, I mean
And Macs were in schools everywhere
Especially when you and I were growing up
And Loki, Macs were everywhere
In our schools
And that was a really smart ploy on Apple's part
But certainly you get attached
I was in yearbook
Which I know is something very similar to what you do now
You might not do yearbook, but you do publishing
And we did that shit on PageMaker on a Mac
It was good times
And now we're like, did you use PageMaker?
InDesign, hello
But yeah, but Adobe
Even fully supported the Mac platform
For ages until they finally realized
Oh yeah, PC's caught up, oops
And there was also the gaming connection too on the 2600
Jobs had played a role in
Breakout on the Atari 2600
That's one of the more kind of, I mean
Woz talked about how he kind of got shafted
On the Atari bonus on that game
But regardless of all that
And how things went down
He did kind of have that more direct impact on the gaming industry
And I gotta say this you guys
This is the one that people forget about
Not everybody, but some people have forgot about
CNN stuff, I think is the most important
In some ways, things that he did
He brought Pixar
Back, and like, Pixar
Is amazing
The movies they make and everything
If you hate every single Pixar movie that's ever been made
I question your taste, I'm sorry to say
But like, you know, and I
Pixar has made some that you may not like
Like I know not everybody dug Cars 2 or Ratatouille
Or A Bug's Life
But seriously, like, Wall-E
Up, Toy Story
1, 2, or 3, take your pick
How often does a movie like that have so many great sequels?
Right?
I do have to say though
Most CG movies today
Are made in Linux-based programs
Well, you know, but
Whether it was Apple PC or what
Jobs bought that company in the 80s
And had that vision of making
An animated movie out of computers
And, you know, a lot of people kind of pass that off
And there's still some today
That kind of feel that, well, traditional animation is best
And, you know, I think
I think we're getting to a place where you get
A good mix of the two, like there's been some great
Traditionally animated ones, like I like Princess and the Frog
An awful lot, but
Boo!
What, you don't like that movie? It was terrible
I haven't seen it. I thought it was great. Hater.
Alright, but then there's some, you know, obviously the stuff
Pixar does, even up through like Tangled
Were really, really good movies, even though I know Tangled
Was not technically Pixar, but
I mean, you look at DreamWorks
Look at any of them, I mean, basically
Pixar really innovated the
The genre
So, um, so yeah
A tip of the hat to a guy
Who, um, was very sassy
Too, like in the way he ran his company
Was very unlike other CEOs
So, a tip of the hat to Steve Jobs
And rest in peace
Sadly, I think we all kind of, I mean
When it happened, it was like, oh wow, but I think we all
Kind of, you know, we all kind of knew
When it happened, I was like
Oh, it finally did, because he had been
Very holistic in his approach
Towards his cancer treatment
And while I'm a big fan
Of holistic treatments
For something like that
I don't condone it
Well, and he had issues
No matter what you believe in
He had issues with his pancreas
And you just, the pancreas is like your heart
If it gets damaged, you can't live without it
And, you know
In some ways, this kind of new strikes
Close to home, because you guys may or may not remember
If you've been listening long enough, back in 2008
I had a pretty serious medical issue that
Took me out of the show for a few weeks, and it was pancreatitis
And it's no joke
And I was very scared there for a minute
When they had to do the MRI on it
Because they told me flat out they had to rule out
Pancreatic cancer, because I had a growth on my pancreas
Thank heavens it was just a cyst
So, you know, I
Absolutely feel, and I know it had to be
A great deal of pain
And now it's been stopped and desisted
Well, in his case, you know
I meant for you. Oh, for me?
Stopped and desisted
Oh, I get it, desisted, har har
But no, at least for him, he's not in pain anymore
Like, he was up on the stage as late as
What, April? He did that?
The Stanford thing too
That was before, but yeah
But April was the whole iCloud thing
And so, you know, he was on stage for that
So when you consider that was six months before
He ultimately passed away
You know, I'm just glad he's not in pain anymore
And I hope his family and all that
Is doing
Okay
Alright, so on to
I'm just gonna turn the car, complete 180
Like really, really sad news to really
Alright, we're going back
Now we're going to Disneyland, everybody
So
We mentioned a couple weeks ago
On the show that we really appreciated
If you guys would nominate us for the podcast award
Which we won back in like 2005
But I don't even think we've been nominated since
Maybe like one time, I don't remember
But it's mostly been, especially in those first
Couple years, 06, 07
A lot of like the corporate cast
And you know, a
nomination in there would go a long way towards
Exposure for the show and everything and
Oh my god, we got nominated, we did
It was announced yesterday, we got nominated
Podcastwords.com if you want to check it out
It's amazing
And what's really amazing, I'm gonna be honest
You know, the other shows that are nominated
Like, I think all but one
Or maybe two of them are indie shows
You're talking like ten shows
And there's some awesome indie shows in there
And so I feel very confident
That some indie is gonna
Walk away with it
And that's great, you know
And indie's gonna be getting the exposure
Although I'd rather be our indie show
Well sure, not gonna lie
It would be awfully nice
No, I want us to be nominated just to lose
It would be awfully nice
But, you know
If you don't vote for us, we'll eat wet cigarette butts
Don't care
We'll throw a protest, no
Obviously we would love a vote
And voting opens on the 12th
Podcastwords.com
It's this interesting thing where you have to vote every day
So please vote often
And yeah
We would really appreciate it
That would be great
But win or lose, we're gonna just keep doing what we always do, right kids?
Yeah, being awesome
I'm gonna quit if we lose
I'm done, stomp
Alright
Let's move on and talk about
We gotta get back to video games
Let's talk about our gaming weeks
And the stuff that we have been playing this week
So DarkStalker, we'll start with you
How was your gaming week?
I really haven't played much of anything
I mean, just because I've been super busy with school
Excuses, excuses
I was on, well, just long enough to do dailies
And that's it, really
I mean, I did like one instance
But like, yesterday
It was Yom Kippur
Oh yeah
Honestly, I have to say that it was
You know, people complain
About fasting
And oh, I'm so tired
But for me, it was actually kind of good to step away from everything
Is Yom Kippur like no technology, either?
Well, on top of that, it was on a Shabbat, regardless
So that means that
Technically, if you're gonna observe it, then yeah, no
Nothing creative
No Facebook, no games, nothing creative
No writing
You read Torah, you read commentaries
Oh, okay, I was like, are you allowed to read on the Kindle?
Only if it's a Torah?
Oh yeah, I guess if I was reading Torah, commentary on the Kindle, I could do that, yeah
But I mean, it's
But for me, it was just sort of like
Stepping away from everything
You know, I turned off my phone
I turned off my computer
You know, I
And yeah, the fasting thing is never fun
But
I spent a lot more time around people
I gotta say
You know, my friends, some of my friends
And I used to do a trip
Sadly, we don't do it anymore
We used to do a trip every year to Mendocino
Off the grid
Because you literally don't have cell service when you're that close to the ocean
And you know, just
It was actually a really neat trip
And it forced me to get away from all that and just be with people
Which was great
So I have to say that actually
It's been a good week of disconnecting
From
The games and the internet
So your gaming week has consisted of
Being anti-technology
It was a vacation
And then I found a game that I totally
Have to have
And that's that Kirby
10 Kirby game
Where it's like Kirby's broken up into 10 parts
And you have to find all of his parts
And then you attack things by throwing a bunch of Kirby's at it
I want that game
Mass attack, that's it, I want that game
Go get it!
I broke
I will fill in for your gaming week then
Since you were on a religious observance
And so forth through the week
What some folks in chat have been playing
YYR in our chatroom says
I bought a Turbo Duo with 11 games
Not that I have much less played or anything
Because this show is rated TG-16
Um
And Tidalitis
Hope I said that right, said my gaming week
Street Fighter III Third Strike Online
Bought DJ Hero 2 on a whim at Big Lots
Well if they were selling it at Big Lots
That means it was probably 10 bucks
Hence why he probably got it on a whim
It's a good whim
I think DJ Hero is a pretty underrated series
It's unfortunately like
The other music games that I played
I buy it
I get all excited about it, play it a little bit
And then it goes away for a while
But then eventually once I have
Nothing to do
I'll go back and play it again
It didn't have fabulous longevity
And I think the fact that it has such a large controller
That you have to kind of like put away
Then get out, plug in
I think honestly when people want to play
Sometimes they just want to turn on the system and go
So I don't know
But yeah, DJ Hero at least was a great game
Alright Loki, how was your gaming week?
Uh, it was pretty good
I played a few things
Grand Theft Auto, barely
Because our firewall has been
Absolute shit
Apparently Microsoft went down
Live went down for a little bit
On Monday
And for some reason after that
Our firewall has been just absolute shit
We were lucky to get 4 out of the 5
Consoles connected to live
In a game together
And actually be able to stay in
It has been more of like
Oh, let's see whose console stays online
Long enough for us to fish the game
And sometimes only two of them
So it kind of sucked
But it's still
Sorry, we played a little bit of that
And then played a little bit of Earth Defense Force
Just doing some farming for my
Jet Trooper guy
And then the new game that I played this week
Was Dead Rising 2 Off the Record
Which I was really excited about that
And it's a pretty awesome game
The only disappointment I have with the game is
Dead Rising 2, one of the things I hated
Was the fact that you have to keep going back
To give your stupid daughter zombrex
I was like, cool!
Dead Rising 2 Off the Record is gonna be
Dead Rising 2 is gonna be awesome
Because you don't have to do that anymore
No, this time
Frank West is infected
And he needs to take zombrex
So I was like
Aw, come on!
Thankfully, when I did that
When I got to that point
I was like, aw, come on!
I switched right over to sandbox mode
And there's none of that shit
So it's just killing zombies and that's it
Funny enough, the way the beginning of that
Is this game already out or is it coming out?
It's coming out
So the way it kind of begins in the sandbox mode
He's being dropped out of a helicopter
Much like the first game
And they're all, so are you covering your next big scoop here?
He's all, no, not this time
This is my vacation!
And doesn't roll onto the roof
And then just starts killing zombies
But everything transfers back and forth
Your experience and costumes
And crap that you get
So right now I went through a sex shop
So I had a bunch of
Weird
Village people-esque
Stuff on
You know, when I think of the village people
I don't necessarily think of sex
Well chaps, okay
Maybe it's a generation thing
Nah, it's more like leather chaps
Alright
Just for whatever reason
I was just picking up all the clothes on the way
Whatever ends up happening, that's fine
But now I have this weird mask and bull horns
On my head, so
Not gonna lie, I always got the biggest kick out of playing a furry
And moisturizing and putting on the big furry costume
Haven't gotten there yet
But it is pretty fun
Yes, I'm a furry
Virtually
But it's nice to be able to do
The photography stuff
And Frank
Even in the main story mission
Which I'll probably go back to that
It's still pretty funny
Because the dialogue
And stuff's a little bit different
But a lot of the stuff that happens in the game
Is similar
It'll be interesting to see how the game plays out
So I'd recommend picking up
Especially since it's not even a full price game
It's just 40 bucks
Only?
It's like Dead Rising 2
But better
It's priced where most games ought to be in my opinion
But anyway
Definitely worth picking up
That's pretty much all I've played this week
Alright
Well hey, let's go to my game of the week
No I'm sorry
One last thing
Burnout Crash played that a little bit
And that's actually pretty fun
Despite the fact that I really hated the idea of a top down burnout
But it's actually a pretty fun game
Alright, you done?
I'm done
You sure?
So I haven't played a whole lot of games
Especially this week
I already told you guys I've been busy as hell
Besides the Disneyland games
I gotta go to Flynn's Arcade because Electronico is back
And play some classic games there
They didn't mix them up a little bit
I noticed some games were gone
But I play stuff like Frogger that's always there
And I also, you know, of course
Midway Mania
Which is a lot of fun
Came back and I've played, of course, a lot of Warcraft this week
As far as other games
That are not things I've already talked about on the show before
I took an opportunity
Since we were just talking about game pricing
I took an opportunity to pick up the latest
Humble Bundle
And if you didn't know
There is the Humble Frozen Synapse Bundle
Going on right now
And that is where you basically pay
What you want for the game Frozen Synapse
And it comes with
The game Spacechem as well
And if you're not familiar with Humble Bundle
They just had one of these
Not even a month or two ago
Because I remember that's how I got VVVVV
Was in one of these Humble Bundles
It's a very interesting
New way to price
Games
Where people can kind of pay what they want
And these games are not necessarily
New, but
They're, you know
Good games
And I think something a lot of people
May not have given another look
If they didn't have this whole pay what you want thing going on
And I think they're making pretty good money
Off of it and a chunk of it goes to charity
Which I think is great
And it's not just Spacechem either
If, well hold on I want to put this out
So if you spend more than the average
Which right now is $4.75
You get some other games as well
You get Shadow Grounds
You get Shadow Grounds Survivor
I think these other games were
Only with pre-order
I don't think you get them anymore
You get the game Trauma now too I think is thrown in there
And the one other game I want to mention
Because this is the one I played, Trine
Was in the bundle as well
I think Trine was on Xbox Live Arcade
I overlooked it, I never played it
So I'm playing it now on PC for the first time
Because I paid more than the average so I could check it out
It's pretty cool, I like it
When I was reading the description of it
I didn't quite understand it
But now that I'm playing it I'm like oh okay
So it's like a puzzle game
But you can automatically switch between a warrior type
A thief type and a wizard type
But when I say a puzzle game
I'm talking like a side scroller
So it's like Mario-esque I guess you want to say
But when you switch to the wizard
The warrior can draw blocks or he can levitate blocks
The thief has a long range attack
And can use a grappling hook
The warrior has a short range attack
And can use a shield
And you literally hit one button to switch between
Because the story kind of goes that all three of them
Find this magical item
That they get attached to
Because usually the thief and the warrior
Would not be getting along
And the mage and the thief would be having this weird
Thing going on
So the item binds them all together
And so now their souls are all shared or whatever
So they're going on this adventure to remedy that
And find treasure along the way
So that's basically the premise of the game
So you hit one button to switch between all these different types
So I think it's cool
And the other thing I love about these Humble Bundles
Is that they come with a key
So you can play them in Steam
So you buy the thing loaded in Steam
Now you have all the Steam achievements
People know what I'm playing
Can compete against me and all that good stuff
So
For the low low price of whatever
It's great
But again I would recommend you
Not be totally cheap
Spend let's just say five bucks at least
And get the other games as well
And if you're having a good week give them ten
It's a good cause
Or whatever you think these games are worth
So yeah that's at HumbleBundle.com
And trying alone was worth it
I gotta admit I tried
I was gifted a copy of Frozen Synapse
About two weeks ago
And Steam was having
A buy one get one free sale
Where people could give the codes to other people
And somebody was kind enough to give me their code for Frozen Synapse
I gotta admit
I didn't get it at all
I think I just need to try again
Sometimes you have to be in the right mindset
Have you guys ever had that?
You have to just be in the right mindset to enjoy a game
Sometimes you'll sit down and play it once
And you're like I don't get it
But then you go back a month later and play it again
And you're like oh man what was I missing
Which is why I don't think I ever reviewed it on the show
Cause I knew I wasn't really prepared to talk about it
Oh did Dark Soccer just buy the HumbleBundle?
Yes it did
Alright
I think you'll like trying
I'm not gonna buy this one because I haven't even played through more than one game
Out of the last bundle I bought
But didn't you play VVVVV until you beat it?
Yes
Until I beat it but not 100%
Because I still have one more
Shiny object to get
And I just want to rip my hair out
If I'm supposed to get that
It's annoying
I mean I get it
It's supposed to be hard
But I don't want to play it anymore
Because it's so hard
I'm not gonna come back to it
Cause I know what happens if I get it
It just flips the damn game upside down
Spoiler
And you play the same thing again
No it's still the same fucking game because you flip up and down
It's not like Castlevania
I get what you're saying
But up until you get to that point
It's an amazing game and the music is amazing
No it's an amazing game I love it
It's such a simple concept
It's just like
I know alright alright
But anyway I think
You should play Trion on 360
Cause I think a lot of people may have already played it
I would say that alone makes the set worth it
But you know
Check it out
Frozen Synapse I think is a bit more of a strategy game
Also comes with soundtracks in the editor
I haven't even picked that up
See you know what I just picked up my steam code
And went to town
Yeah
There you go
Salacious Pop is reminding me in our chatroom
Trion is also gorgeous
I'm doing this in the name of Orange Jones Radio
Even though I just put 10 bucks
Well still
Let's see
Trion is very gorgeous at least on the PC
I haven't seen it on 360 so I can't compare
But it is a very good looking game
Very cartoony lush lighting effects
It is a really good looking game
And very smooth on my computer
And I'm playing it in like 1680 by 1050
Widescreen
In high quality so
It's great
Yeah actually Salacious Pop may not even know
I didn't even have the graphics on their highest setting
I had it on high not very high
So maybe I'll have to try again later with the very high
So anyway that's pretty much my gaming week
So I think we will move on
To gaming news and talk about all that
With you guys in our chatroom
I guess I can quickly mention once again
Please follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash o-l-r
We also have a Facebook at facebook.com
Slash orange launch radio
This is also the part of the show where I will mention
Any housekeeping like upcoming shows that we're missing
And what have you
I'm stuck for the rest of the year
I don't see myself missing any shows
You know something unforeseen may always come up
I'm missing one in a few weeks
That's right Dark Soccer you are leaving for a week at the end of the month right?
I will be gone on the 23rd
So hopefully we'll have a guest host
Just like you guys had Dan here when I wasn't here
And we'll move on
Alright let's get into some gaming news
Loki start us off what's up
So PlayStation 2 games
As we've kind of thought for a while
Are going digital
In this new only on PlayStation Network campaign
They're going to be doing
Every Tuesday this month
They're going to have a new
Exclusive selection of rare
Classic games
God Hand, Grim Grimoire, Maximo
And Odin Sphere
And Ring of Red
Um
And I guess you know of course they
They're old PlayStation 2 games
They've done nothing to them no updates
Or whatsoever they just play now
On the PlayStation 3
And um
I guess um
PlayStation Plus members get them at
A 20% off discount
During the launch week
And if you spend more than $60
In October you'll get a $10
Credit for November
So um
Interesting
I guess they're saying there's also
A lineup of PlayStation Network exclusives
Now these aren't necessarily
These are actually not
PlayStation 2 games but
Euphoria and
Rock Hard that was actually
This week on the 4th
Next week on the 11th Sideway
New York on the 13th
Sodium Collection
If it's sodium
Might as well forget about it
18th Okabu
And Rocketbirds
And then on the 25th the expansion for
Infamous 2, Infamous Festival Blood
And Pixel Junk
Side Scroller
But all I gotta say is
Yeah thanks Sony you figured out a way
To play PlayStation 2 games on your PS
On your PS3 systems
But you don't do a free update
For everybody so they can I don't know take their old games
That they have and make everybody happy
Because they have backwards compatibility
No you decide to sell them on the marketplace
Figures
I'm trying to give Sony the
The
Whatever you call it I have a headache
Thank you the benefit of the doubt
I'm trying to give Sony the benefit of the doubt right now
And the whole
Backwards compatibility thing and I'm trying to think
Ok what is the reason why
You couldn't just put a disc into the PlayStation 3
It's because they had an entire PlayStation 2
In the PlayStation 3 originals
Right?
That emotion chip or whatever it was called in the PlayStation 2
Right?
Then eventually they got rid of it
Have they emulated that?
Well then they got rid of one of the chips
Remember that's why the backwards compatibility got cut a little bit
But then they also were able to cut the price by a hundred bucks
Yes and then they got rid of both chips
But now they have
Obviously an emulator because this is the way
That the PlayStation 1 games work
Because it's all emulation
So now they have an emulator that works
Or some way obviously that's able to do this stuff
And
They just
I know what you're doing
Here's my other question
Ok the whole benefit of the doubt thing
Is it maybe a situation similar to
Xbox 360 and original Xbox
Or maybe their emulator doesn't emulate
Everything and that's why they don't want to open it up
Because maybe it can't play the big big games
Like I mean you got a lot of neat games
In this original launch here
But let's be real it's not like you have
Your Final Fantasy X
Your Grand Theft Auto Vice City
Well yeah they're doing
Just rare
Classic games right now like God Hand
Like real niche stuff
That nobody maybe bought the first time
These I can guarantee aren't
All in the same engine
That's kind of how the Xbox backwards compatibility
Worked is they were trying to get
Everything to work correctly and you'd see
Like a big lot of games that were
All you know part of the same
You know engine game engine
They were running on that's why all these games
All of a sudden became available
That's why you got the Barbie Horse Adventures and you know some other
Good games
It
It's because they lost
It's because they lost a lot of money
When the Playstation Network went down
And they need to recoup that
That's why they're selling them
I did notice
That there was very little fanfare about this
You know what I mean like we've been building
Up to this for a long time remember about two years ago
There were the whole rumors about the Dreamcast
Things were going to be coming and
I don't know but those already have
No but there was something else about like
Around that same time like Playstation 2
Games were supposed to be opened up
Like there was a whole thing in that memo or whatever
Like I just seem to remember hearing that something with
Sega and it kind of never came to fruition
But we've been like waiting a long time
And thought there would be a big announcement
Like I thought there would be something at E3
Or even Tokyo Game Show about this
But no this just was like no yeah we're gonna
Just put these up in the marketplace enjoy
Well that's why you're seeing a lot of these older games that are
Very niche and stuff because these companies aren't gonna
Necessarily put out like these HD
Remakes or whatever of their old games
So like obviously you're not gonna
Find a Grand Theft Auto or something like that
Is part of this because
You know as we discussed last week of course
They're going to at some point up res all the
Grand Theft Auto games and put it out on a disc
I mean it's just
Stupid that if they don't I mean
Why wouldn't you especially if you know San Andreas
It would be easy all you would have to do
Is re-license the music in there
Obviously that would be a cost
And maybe re-record you wouldn't even
Necessarily have to re-record the
Audio in the game
Obviously you'd have to get the rights from all the
Voice actors and stuff like that but
You know if you put it in the
Rage Engine or something like that and they've already
Done that on the PC modders have already taken care of that
It could be done
And it's just getting all the
Rights and all the legal stuff taken
Care of but once they do that I mean
It's just gonna be amazing
Going to our chatroom for some comments at chat.orangelauncherady.com
SSJ100Matt
Says it's tactics like this that make
People want to hack their PlayStation 3
YYR says maybe
They're just doing software emulation
Wasn't there a PlayStation 3 model that did that already
Although it didn't support every game?
I remember that too wasn't it the Europe one?
Or maybe they had one here too but wasn't there
One overseas?
The old 80 gig systems that came
Out here a long time ago
80 and the 40
I think it was the 80 gig systems like the
Melger Solid one it was one of the first ones that
Supported just some of
The titles and not all of them
You mean like the one sitting in my front room?
Maybe. And then the 40 gig
Systems stopped supporting it and eventually
The 80 gig systems also stopped supporting it
But yeah it is
Software emulation so
Is the PlayStation 1 games
And in fact the PlayStation 1
Games you can take that
Emulator and basically dump any ISO
Into it and it'll work just fine
That's what they've done on hacked PSPs
Is they've taken that same emulator and you
Can run any PlayStation 1 game
And I'm guessing this is probably the same
Situation with the PlayStation 2 stuff
Is it's just an emulator that they have
And they've found a way to just
Basically they can dump any ISO in there
And done. They're ready to go
I don't know cause I haven't really seen anybody
Try to hack it apart yet but
I'm guessing that's probably what it is
Do you think they'll make a lot of money off this Loki?
Um yeah cause especially the games
That they're putting up like Odin Sphere you know
That's a game that was out there for just a
Little bit and it's a pretty awesome game
And a lot of people probably missed it and same with
God Hand. God Hand was another one that was just
You know clover game that's just
Amazing
Yeah I gotta admit there's some of those that I kinda
Want to check out too but thankfully
Alan has like a couple of these
Already so it's just like oh we just
Gotta hook up the PlayStation 2
It's sad though that they aren't even
Trying to like
Update these at all I mean they're not even
Smoothing out the graphics
Or whatever that you would get I think you can
Do that with the PlayStation 3
Well shit I haven't even tried to run
A PlayStation 2 game on my 20
Gig well 500 gig now
But um
I know you can do the smoothing stuff
Like kind of how you were able to with the
PlayStation 2 on PlayStation 1 games
You know it was a little bit better
Um
But yeah I mean it's just
It's kinda sad
That they're selling them and now I understand
Yeah I need to make money but
I think it would make a lot of people happy
If they you know brought that out there
So people can do that and then you can
Sell the games as well cause not everybody has
Got hand or Odin Sphere
And hell you can't
Buy new copies of that anymore so
That might be a good way to
You know drive sales and same with the PlayStation 1 games
PS3's are fully
Backwards compatible with PlayStation 1 games
And I'm pretty sure they sell a lot of PlayStation 1
Games on their network so
I don't understand why they don't do it
Um if I may rewind just a little bit
Sure of course
The game's plot that was a
Pre-order one
Um are including it when it's available
Oh okay
Nice
Woohoo
Good to know
Alright well let's move on with some other news
This is also about Sony and a comment
That they have made this week and it's about
The Vita which a lot of people are looking forward to
And I gotta say I'm one of them
I'm definitely picking up a Vita at launch
Loki you're getting one of these too right?
Maybe
What are you sitting on the fence with right now
That has more financial
Stuff it's financial
Is it? Okay
Well it is a financial investment I guess no matter how you look at it
I mean I guess it's financial for me too
But I just I have a real tendency to spend a lot of money
On stupid crap
The lineup is looking nice it's just
We'll see what they have at launch I mean
Alright well let's talk about a comment
That Jon Culler this week who's the director
Of hardware marketing mentioned in an interview with
Investor Palace
Quote we firmly believe that PlayStation Vita
Will supersede the mobile market when launched
And have grand ambitions for a product
That is really at the forefront of innovation
The mobile market in the US
Offers consumers extremely light gaming
Options
So in other words
They seem to think that
Despite the fact that the iPhone
Is out there with their mobile gaming and all that
That the Vita
Can kind of give mobile gaming
A run for its money
Even though it's not a phone
Yeah
Um
I don't know about that
I do like the fact that
They're opening up to developers
And the fact that it has controllers
I mean buttons
It's important and it's definitely
Something that's sorely missed on a lot of these
You know iPhone games and stuff and
The fact that it's gonna have
Still the touch sensor you could
Pretty much if you're a developer you could port this
Stuff over to the PlayStation
Or whatever
And you know if it does
End up turning out to be pretty viable
You could see a lot of stuff coming out of there
And yeah they could quickly catch up
Beating out Apple right away
I don't know about that
I mean cause they're not gonna sell more units
Than there are iPhones or iPods or whatever
iPads
Just like their two tablets I mean come on
Yeah those things are terrible looking
I mean come on
No
I
Well you know I'm still looking forward to the Vita
And I think the intricacy of the games
On here are not gonna be able to
I mean I will be
A step higher certainly than what you get
On the iPhone and so forth despite everything
That you know iPhone showed this week
But
I think the other big thing that sets this apart
Is just the fact that it's designed as a gaming system
First so therefore you have things like
I don't know tangible buttons
And sort of the features that gamers
Would want but of course
This whole comment like this you know
We're better than
The mobile games and so forth I think it just serves
As justification for them to charge way more money
For the games and how much weren't you saying the games
Were like 50 bucks on this thing right now
Yeah that's what the PSP games are
I just I couldn't I always thought
PSP games are
$40 now
But they're they used to be 50 bucks
I mean it's just now
You're not seeing a lot of games sold on there
But yeah there's still $50 games on the PSP
And I think that's a great price point
I mean assuming that stays there
And doesn't go any higher cause
I don't know I just
Don't think they should be but I like the fact though
That the system is gonna be very much like the original
PSP where it's a gaming system
But it does a lot of other shit
Right right and I think
That will be probably ultimately its greatest
Strength as well is that it's a great college
Kids system and I think that's
Probably where the PSP sold a lot too
So there you go
Alright well DarkSakura what do you got for us?
I have some stuff and it's more
Sony yay
Basically they've implied that
All the first party titles are going to use the online pass
Basically they're
Pulling an EA like the $10
Deal so they're
Saying that Uncharted 3 is gonna use
The online pass system
That was introduced earlier with Resistance 3
And saying that
Online pass will be incorporated into future Sony
Computer Entertainment Worldwide Studios
Games with online functionality
Let me say they're gonna
Announce more on it later
Well now a first party is on board I think it's time to
Just accept that this is now the norm
Yeah right? Pretty much
There's still some people that are
I think you'll see a lot more third parties do it
You're not gonna see Microsoft do it
They can't I mean that would just look good
Microsoft can't do it you're right I agree with you there
Unless they stop charging for gold
Which they're not gonna do
So it would be very interesting
If they try though
I can't wait for that episode
And Nintendo well you know
They don't even know online exists
What online? Exactly
That was funny you made a story
It's like you have to charge for an online pass
What? There's online? There's online?
So we can maintain our online system
What?
What online?
Well who knows?
There's still a lot of question marks
Like what does it do?
Well one of those huge question marks is
How's it gonna handle online?
And they have been purposefully quiet on it
Because they don't fucking know
They better know by June
Like crap
We have to do online as well
Our online system will be significant
Significantly bad
I told you at E3 right
When they brought the EA guy out on stage
I thought he was gonna come out to announce
The EA guy
That EA was gonna just do the online part of the Wii
Like I seriously thought
Cause they were talking about a partnership and stuff
And they mentioned like online games and stuff
And I thought oh they're just gonna let EA
Handle the online part of the Wii
That'll be what it is
No that wasn't what it is
That would be terrible if they did that
And that would be sad
Alright moving on Loki
So
It's kinda cool during the same time as
The Apple
And Vail of their new
Technology devices and stuff like that
There was this whole
Kind of like Flash
Adobe conference
Adobe Max conference going on
And some of the new things
That they're showing first off
Unreal Engine support for Flash 11
Which is kind of interesting
You're gonna actually have some really decent looking games now
Running in the Flash
Or even in your own
Web browser so
That's kinda cool
People are saying hey maybe
This could be a major transition in social gaming
No it won't
I'm afraid that's not gonna be the case
Cause you know what
Yes the technology may be out there
To do that
But doesn't necessarily mean that a company
Is going to do that seeing as they can develop a game
Much cheaper that doesn't necessarily
Need the Unreal 3 engine
But it's neat to see that
Hey someday we may be playing
Unreal Tournament
In our web browser
And then
Of course not to be outdone by that
Crytek also is
Investigating Flash for the
Cry engine and possibly
Doing some sort of cross platform
Solution including
Support with
A bunch of other
Systems. They're even saying maybe
Looking into iOS and Android that'd be kinda cool
I don't know if that'd be able to
Obviously not some of the phones
Out there like mine but
Very cool
And of course they're saying
Crytek Seal is hard
To work at. The first person shooter
Warface which is supposed to be coming out in
Asian regions
But
It might be pretty cool if they do some
Sort of easy
Cross platform solution you may see a lot of these
PC games being ported to
Many other devices other than just
Xbox 360 and PS3
In the near future
So
That's cool and it'll be interesting to see
If web browsers actually get
Enough technology where
They can support really good looking
Games that would be kind of interesting
Because then you wouldn't necessarily need
You know like
A tablet device or game
Console or whatever you just
Play the game. Well web based
Game also makes me think about
Facebook games and Google Plus
Games of which I wish more stuff was
There on Google Plus but whatever
You know and whether you love or hate
Facebook games you gotta think
If this technology is gonna be available
Soon like could you imagine if
Unreal was a Facebook game?
I don't know if that would be
I see the problem is
I just shot my friend DarkSakura
In the face! Click here
To post to your wall and try Unreal
Games now. The problem with that though is
I just don't see them
Doing like a casual game
Like that because once again you know Facebook
Kind of tends to
Skew towards casual gamers
And I don't really see
Unreal Tournament you know
Appealing to my mom or something
Unreal Engine shows up in really weird
Stuff. Yes that's true. Like you wouldn't expect
A game I completely neglected to mention
In my game week probably because I
Played it like three weeks ago
When I was on hiatus from the show
Was the Mortal Kombat collection
The classic Mortal Kombats
I downloaded that on Playstation Network
And played that a little bit
And I was surprised to see the powered by
Unreal technology logo at the beginning
I realized the new game is
But I was like well what the hell about the classic
Emulation needs the fucking Unreal
Engine? Like really?
The only thing I could possibly think of
Are the little like rotating
Images of the arcade cabinets
I'm like what?
Or maybe there's some maybe I just
Haven't seen it yet maybe there's like an unlockable demo
For the new one or something that shows up
But I was kind of surprised to see that
I was like okay I know
Mortal Kombat 3 and 2 and 1
Did not run on the Unreal Engine
No I'm pretty sure they did not
This is funny to me
So
Although if they somehow you know
Enabled it to where they took the old
MoCap stuff and made it into actual
3D models with the
MoCap license
You know likenesses and stuff
It would be very interesting to see something like that
It's like oh hey look it's classic Mortal Kombat
But we can turn it in any direction
And it's 3D
Some might pay for that
Tigerclaw in our chatroom at chat.orangetontrader.com says
An Unreal web based game is possible
Look at Quake Live for example
Well there's a good example Quake Live is a good time
So
I'd like to see more stuff like that
Certainly it would be very interesting
It would also be interesting to see what MMOs
That's another big thing that web browsers are used for
Some of those free MMOs
Although the quality of some of those is
Questionable
This could take a lot of that to the next level
It would be interesting to see what happens
Dear Square Enix
Final Fantasy XIV
Do Square Enix already uses Unreal Engine
For some of their projects?
Well I know they used it for one game that no one ever bought
It was Infinite Undiscovery right?
Haven't they used it on Unreal Engine?
Infinite Undiscovery was the other one that came out around the same time
Yes that no one bought
I can't remember the name of it
Last Remnant
No one bought it
No I remember that because I think Alan bought it
Or he had it
Or played it or something
I thought there was another
Final Fantasy XIII uses Unreal
Oh really?
I think it does
Hmm
You know what I miss?
That was pretty cool
What? What are you talking about?
Do you remember the Square Enix game The Bouncer?
I remember that game
I remember a brawler called Ergeist
But I don't remember
Oh Ergeist was awesome
That's a game you need a sequel for right there
The Bouncer was an early PS2 title
Yeah it was actually pretty awesome
Were they all Final Fantasy X characters?
Except they worked in a bar?
As bouncers
As bouncers
It was a weird game
It was awesome
Alright
I tried to look at the Wikipedia article for Final Fantasy XIII
When I need to do research quickly
There's always Wikipedia
Where people have done the research for me
I tried to do a search on Unreal and didn't find it
But I thought I saw that logo in the beginning of the game
Or heard something about it
Speaking of Final Fantasy
It's not on our show roll tonight
Since I brought up XIII it just triggered it for me
Did you guys see the full trailer for XIII Versus?
At the web this week?
It looks hot
It looks very hot
It's Final Fantasy, but I have no idea why it's XIII
I know it's set in the same universe
But I didn't see any of the characters
Not really, I thought it was supposed to set more of a real
I don't know what the hell it has to do with XIII
But whatever
There will probably be some obscure little thing when you actually play the game
But the action, the battles
Kind of look like Kingdom Hearts
With the hit points showing up on the screen
It looks sweet actually
We're going to do an awesome radio moment here
And I'm going to pull up the trailer here in studio
And I'll post this in chat so you guys can see this too
For those of you that are on the podcast feed
I'll have DarkSakura posted to our Tumblr
At orangeloungeradio.tumblr.com
Are you not an IRC DarkSakura?
I am an IRC
I meant like privately so I can copy the URL
Oh yeah I will
As soon as I pull it up here
I remember, is this it? No this isn't the right one
Where did I see that trailer?
Somebody in chat will probably
Hello Tigerclaw
Right?
Tigerclaw should have posted it by now
Gameplay trailer
Maybe it's
No that's Eidos, that's Deus Ex
Who the hell posted this
And I watched it the other day
I think somebody had posted it on Facebook
Oh so in other news
No kidding
I have made Fantastic Nut Bread
It was quite delicious
It has no flour
I made it with no flour
It's made with almond meal
You're not trying to find anything on the new Facebook by the way
Your mission
If you choose to accept it
Find something on Facebook
There's a plugin for Chrome that makes it run like the old version
Yes
The problem is I don't want to use Chrome
But yeah
Oh yeah that's right
They did have the last remnant on PC
Anyway
Well Rob's looking that up
I found one
But it's not the right one
They did a flip of it
I'm trying to see if I can find the
Holy crap
I'm trying to see if I can find the actual gameplay parts
Oh wait
This was uploaded in like 2009
This isn't even right
Gosh darn it
Tigerclaw find it for us
I will keep looking for it
Sorry guys
Terrible radio
But I know I saw it
Shoot the next story is mine
I can't look for it while I talk about this story
So I'll get through this quickly
Although maybe not because this is actually pretty big news
Microsoft has talked a little bit this week
About some of the TV updates
For the Xbox 360
We knew after E3 that they were going to be doing this
They were going to be bringing more television to the 360
But we didn't really know how
Well it turns out
They've announced some partnerships
And some of those include HBO
And HBO Go, Comcast, Syfy
And Verizon
I guess there was an earlier list that had leaked
And it turns out a lot of that seems to be correct
They did publish a full list of the
Partners that will be in the fall dashboard update
Comcast went so far
As to make a blog post talking about
Using the partnership with Microsoft to
Offer Xfinity content
So it sounds like, and this is
Of direct relevance to me because
I have Comcast at home living where I live
It sounds like
That you will be able to
Use the on demand system
In Comcast, you can use that
In
The 360 now
But see that's the thing
I was hoping it would be more original stuff
And not necessarily just everything that's on
Demand, because if I want to watch on demand
I can hit one
Button on my remote and I get on demand
Content, I don't need to necessarily
You know, unless
Unless you're able to like say
Take your console to
Friends house or something like that and then you can
Access all your on demand content
That way
I don't know, I was just hoping for more
Original stuff, like an alternative
That me having to have cable
You know what I mean?
Bajillion alternatives out there anyway
So I mean
This is just adding to the pile
So
What I'm also curious of is that if
They're announcing all these other partnerships
The weird thing is though, doesn't HBO want to
Charge you 10 bucks for their service and then
These other, well HBO I don't think you can
Access unless you have HBO, it's kind of like
How Xfinity
And stuff, you can't access HBO
On demand stuff unless you have HBO
And isn't it the same with like
A mobile app, like you can't access
Mobile CNN video unless you have like
Comcast or something? Yeah, see so
That's why I was just kind of like
Eh, don't really care, I mean cause
Well, I gotta say though, I do like
The idea that you know, because the HBO
Stuff isn't on Netflix and it's not really on
Demand either, I like that it'll kind of be
All in one place, like I get what you're
Saying with the one button on the remote, but
You know, if the Xbox 360 is gonna be this
All in one entertainment device, it'd be nice
If you can DVR stuff, that'd be pretty awesome
If you don't want to pay for DVR
I don't think that's gonna
Happen, but you know
Also, it looks like
AT&T U-verse is gonna
Require Xbox Live Gold
Starting in November, that was a note
That was sent by the AT&T folks
To their customers, which I'm assuming
Is lining it up with everything else here, right?
The TV service will actually require Xbox Live Gold
All of them
But before
Their boxes or whatever
Through AT&T U-verse, because some of them
Still already have that
You know, they do not require
Gold
But they will now come November
That might make some people a little bit upset
But not AT&T customers, though
Nope
Because they're giving them a $60 credit
Right, so yes, they give
A $60 credit
To existing AT&T U-verse customers
For Xbox 360 customers
Now is that each year or just one year?
I think it's just one time, probably
That would make sense
I want Comcast to give me a $60 credit
Alright, so
Who found this? Loki found this
Did you find this with somebody's help in chat?
Nope, I searched Final Fantasy 13
Versus sort by date
Alright, well good job
Here's what the gameplay looks like in the game
So you can kind of see
There's some live action
Things that happen
The final round still kind of looks
13-ish, but there's a lot of life
So here's some battle
What's he doing in New York?
Right, it's kind of Kingdom Hearts-ish
But with that very
Final Fantasy 7
Or 7 slash 13
Environment, you know what I mean
The swirly bits look like 12
Yeah, I can see that
I can see a little bit of 12 here, too
But I like this, too
Did you notice those little pictures in the corner
That the people are actually
Live rendering what the people are doing
That's pretty cool
Here, watch your safety
It's cool, yeah, it's awesome
It's not just a static picture, it's what they're doing
That's like that add-on I use in WoW
It's like X-Pearl
Yeah, it's X-Pearl
Final Fantasy X-Pearl
So there you go, there's what your Final Fantasy looks like
Is that Cloud?
It's Cloud with a gun
Send me that and I'll put it on our
Tumble bubble blubber
There it is for the chatters
Because I know us watching trailers isn't always the best radio
But there you go, now you have a place you can go look it up
If you haven't already seen it
So, I guess let's move on
With some other gaming news
Dark Sakura
Complete with an ad by Queen Latifah
Sorry, Dark Sakura, I've got to distract you from the trailer
Well, how about some Skyward Sword characters
There's actually
A few spoilers
And you'll hear it here first
So there is
Link and Zelda
Are childhood friends
And have a special bond
There is a bully
At Link's school named Groose
G-R-O-O-S-E
And there is
A person named Fe
Who is the spirit
Don't worry, Link, it gets better
Spirit of the Goddess Sword
And there is
Gaepora
Who is
Zelda's father
And the headmaster of Link's school
So
There is another place in the game called
Faron Woods
And you start off the game in a place called
Skyloft
And you can go to Skyview Temple
Where Zelda was kidnapped and is being held
Again, yay
As far as attacks
That are in there, there's holding down the A button
Makes Link run faster and gives him acrobatic
Abilities, he can run up
Walls
I guess like he's Spider-Man or some shit
Or the fucking
Prince of Persia
He can grab onto cliffs
But that uses Link's stamina
But you can replenish his stamina over time
There's a spin attack that gives you stamina
And when your stamina is depleted
You go slowly
You become old man Link
And that's all I'm going to talk about it
Although
There is one interesting thing that's in there
You can douse
You know what dousing is right?
You know the old thing where people would have
The forked stick and look for water
That's dousing
I thought there was another name for that
A diving rod?
Divining rod
Because I've known
Hippy people that do like
Dowsing on your aura and stuff
I know hippies
Rama in our chat room says
Link in high school, what is this? Saved by the Triforce?
But anyway
Tiffany Amber Thiessen will be playing
The part of Zelda
But for dousing basically you hold out
The sword and point it in the direction of the target
And it will flash
So basically it's to lead you in the right direction
It's kind of
Hmm
Shadow Colossus did it first
So
Bunny did it back in the
40's
Simpsons did it
I'm done
Well just for
Rama
Since Rama brought it up
I was going to play this for you
This was Dark Sakura's reaction
To actually hearing about the Zelda game
Yes I can
I'm so excited
I'm so excited
I'm so
Scared
You know I never watched that show for a reason
That was the infamous
Caffeine Pills episode
I understand
But I never
Watched that show because I can't watch a show with people
Acting stupid
Seriously that's why I don't watch Seinfeld
But yet you went with us to watch Showgirls
Because that's different
They weren't being stupid to be funny
It was funny without trying to be funny
Let's travel around the world
And check out what's going to be coming to a game store
Near you
Saved by the bell collection on blu-ray maybe?
I don't know
That's not a game
Thank god
That'd be terrible
Anything saved by the bell in the game would be terrible
Unless you had to murder all of them
In which case that could be cool
So this week actually some pretty cool stuff

Lots of games
Jonah Luma Rugby Challenge on 360
Yet another rugby game exclusive to
GameStop for some reason
And uh
1001 Touch Games on
Nintendo DS, Might and Magic Heroes
Why on earth would you make your game exclusive to GameStop?
Rugby games
They did that, yeah
It's weird. The last rugby game that came out
People like rugby? I understand that but
People don't like GameStop and I don't want to go
There to get my rugby game
I mean, let's be real. I'm not gonna buy it
505 did it with their last rugby game that came out
At the beginning of September and they made it
Yeah, nobody has explained to me
What the fucking connection between GameStop and
Rugby is
I have no clue. No idea
1001 Touch Games
For the DS, Might and Magic Heroes
6 on PC
And god a game
I hope tanks so god damn bad
Skylanders Spyro's Adventure
On Playstation 3, Xbox 360
Wii, 3DS and PC
May it burn in hell
And for the new listeners
Why do you want this game to fail?
It's because it's a pain in the ass
It's Activision's adventure into
Toys and games
And if you think download content is bad
And you think oh Activision they're gonna
Whore out download content
You ain't seeing shit with
Skylanders
My god, they have 30 different
Toys you can buy
Little figurines, and I hardly even call them toys
They do not move whatsoever
They're statues, they're basically
Download content, they cost $8 each
Cause they're trying to get kids
To buy the shit
And you know how twisted this is?
They got in bed with Toys R Us
So that they can get on their top
Hot 15 games
Or Hot 15 toys list
Which they did, and they have an exclusive pack
Over at Toys R Us, a 3 pack of their figures
Yeah, cause that hot
Hot games list, yeah that's not manipulated
At all to get people to buy shit
Right
So, hope it tanks
So don't follow the hot games list
Yes, don't follow it, and it's not
It's rigged, it's not Spyro
Spyro, it's not what it used to be
Shenanigans, it's just like us getting nominated
For a podcast award, shenanigans
It's just, it's really not worth it
I mean seriously, it's $70
To buy this game, on a 3DS
By the way, it's $70 for the 3DS
Wow, oh my god
And $70 on every other platform except PC
Which is $60
Do you really want to spend $70 for a happy square game?
Will the little toys do my laundry?
Nope, they do nothing, they do not move at all
Alright, I'm just saying
This will be the next
Tony Hawk ride game
I mean, it's
I will be surprised if this takes off
Alright, we'll see what happens
If that's it for your releases, then let's go to Japan
And check out what's coming out in Japan
On the Xbox 360 this week in Japan
Dead Rising 2 off the record
Forza Motorsport 4 gets its release in Japan
As well as Ace Combat, Assault Horizon
Call of Juarez, the Cartel
Halo Reach gets a price reduction
In the Platinum Collection in Japan this week
And Connectimals gets a release
Is this the one that has bears in it?
Plus bears, yeah
It's Connectimals
Yes, that's right
Connectimals and bears
By the way, when I was at Disneyland
I went in the Innovations building
They have a lot of Kinect stuff there
In the Innovations building
You can play like Child of Eden and stuff
But they have a little room, and I thought this was neat
They had a little room set up for kids
And they were actually people working for Disney
Helping these kids play Connectimals
And they had it on a giant TV
I'm talking like the size of the wall in this house
They had a giant TV playing Connectimals
My friend Victoria played it for a little bit
It was kind of fun
It's nice to see some love in the Innovations building
I thought it was closed
I think it kind of closes
It's been remodeled since the last time
I was there, and you don't
Enter the same way you used to
There's no little show when you go in
They figured that was kind of dry
Well, we made it a point
We said we each need to do something we've never
Done at Disneyland before, and my friend Victoria
Had never been to the Innovations building
So we went in
And believe it or not, there's some neat stuff in there
They still have some Microsoft Surfaces
Remember those? The tables?
Those were fun
So what did you not do before Disneyland?
What did I not do before that we did?
I don't remember
Did you go on the boat?
I think there was a ride we went on
That I just hadn't been on before
For whatever reason
I can't remember off the top of my head
Did you sneak onto the PeopleMover?
We went to the Carnation Plaza grounds
And we ate lunch there
I don't think that was the official thing
But we did eat our lunch there
Because that's going away because they're making the new
Tangled area there
And the Fantasyland expansion
We just sat and ate and enjoyed it
For the last time
I liked where we ate last time
In New Orleans Square
That was great
Carnation Plaza Gardens
It's been there since the 50s
And it's where they used to do some live shows
And events but now it's like
Hardly anybody's there and it's right smack in the middle
That's another little restaurant that's at the end of Main Street isn't it?
There's no restaurant there anymore
I mean but it was a restaurant at the end of Main Street
That's across from where the buffet is
On the opposite side
Yes it is
So you can name something in Disneyland and I can pretty much figure out where it is
Alright
Moving on to
I want to make sure
I caught everything on the 360
Let me go on to the
PlayStation 3
Which this week will get
Ace Combat, Assault Horizon, Dead Rising 2
Off the record
As well as Call of Juarez, the Cartel
And Medal of Honor gets a price reduction going into the Best Hits series
And that is again PlayStation 3
In Japan
Trying to quickly look and see if there's anything
On 3DS this week
Or
The Wii even
Let's see the 3DS
Nope not this week
There's a game called Izito 3D
That's it
But the Misty Pink 3DS has come out next week
And I know Loki already has his preordered
On the Wii though Just Dance Wii
Gets a Japanese release this week
I guess that's notable
Especially for music game fans
I don't know if the song list has been localized or what have you
You know I was going to mention something real quick
Cause I noticed this last night when I was checking
Dead Rising 2 had any download content
Just Dance 3
What they have is they have it where you can download trials
So you can check out the songs before you buy them
I think that's a great idea
And I know they do that with Rock Band
But some other music games do not
So yeah
Just Dance on the Wii makes its way to Japan this week
And that's it for Japanese releases
How about
Overseas Dark Soccer the other way
Well in Europe we have
Well I just said the UK we have
Dragon's Age 2 Mark of the Assassin
Coming out on the 11th
Just Dance 3 on the 11th
On the 12th Guardian Heroes for Xbox 360
Which is awesome
Orcs Must Die which is the best name ever
And then on the 14th we have
Ace Combat Assault Horizon Dead Rising 2
Off the record
Forza Motorsport 4
Might and Magic Heroes 6
PES 2012
Renegade Ops
Sesame Street Once Upon a Monster
Spiderman Edge of Time
And World Rally Championship 2
Bleh
Alright
Well let's move on
With a couple more news stories
And then we'll let Dark Sakura have at the classic
Game of the Week
By the way I just gotta say
Part B tonight's gonna be action packed
Usually all the good stuff's in Part A
But there's like some awesome stuff coming for Part B
So I'm just saying for those of you that sometimes
Want to tune out halfway through
You wanna stick around tonight
So I'll tell you why in just a minute
So they announced some cool
Stuff this week during the
Apple press conference
Of course the new thing being the iPhone 4S
Sorry not iPhone 5
But you know what? It's just a name
It's seriously just a name
Everyone's like, man I'm so bummed they didn't announce
The iPhone 5, it's a fucking new
iPhone, who cares if they call it
iPhone 5, iPhone
Fart, it's still a goddamn iPhone
I'd buy an iPhone fart
Plus the thing that gets me
Is that, well there was the 3G
And the 3GS and people
Didn't get their panties and a bunch about that
And quite frankly I'm kinda
Glad they're not putting out the iPhone 5 now
Because I'm still under contract on the 4
I'm not upgrade eligible until January
So if there was like that awesome
Of a phone coming I would be kind of upset
I get to upgrade next month
Do you? Yeah. So you can get a 4S
Yeah. Alright do you think you'll get one?
Yeah. Okay. Oh the dance continue
Are you getting excited about Siri?
Siri. Explain to me the meaning of life
I really don't give a shit about Siri but I'll try it
Yeah. So I mean
You can try it now. I've read about
The Siri pranking on the internet
Like some good phrases that people have thought
Up to yell at like
When your friend activates Siri like things
That you would yell
Siri text my mom that I'm gay
Send
You know just prank things to uh
Send. That's gonna be a
Brand new era of damn you
Autocorrect. Yes. Yes.
It will be. Oh my gosh. Damn you Siri.
Michelle. Michelle are you listening? Michelle you better
Get that thing registered right now
Damn you Siri. Damn you Siri
Dot com
Alright
Um
So anyways iPhone 4S is
Coming October 14th
It adds a brand new processor the A5
Processor which is apparently
Dual core. Up to seven
Times the graphics capability
And uh enhanced
You know camera
More RAM
All sorts of new features
Siri of course as you mentioned
Um
You know new antenna design
GCM or GSM
And CDMA radios in the device
It's gonna be
Available in three different
Flavors if you will. 16 gigabyte
32 gigabyte and 64 gigabyte
Ranging from 199
And of course
In white or black
And of course they're dropping the iPhone 4 down
To $99 for the 8
Gig model and the 3GS
Will apparently be free
If you know you have
With a plan obviously
And that would be the 8 gigabyte model
As well
Some other fun stuff
Of course iOS 5 is coming October 12th
And with that they're gonna be bringing
iCloud and Airplay
To gaming
So you'll be able to
Play with multiple devices streaming to TVs
In fact one of the first games
To support that Real Racing 2
Will allow you to stream I believe
Up to four devices to your TV
And do split screen gaming
With you know it being on your iPhone
I had no idea that this was a feature
In it. Did they even talk about this at the press conference?
Uh I think they did
I slept through it
Well I was reading live blogs too
Kinda just on my break look
And it was like you know showing
Was it you can run
It of course on your iPhone 4s
Or on your iPad 2
And stream wirelessly
Because before they had it where you can link it up to your TV
But you have to hook up an HDMI cable
And stuff so
And of course along with that you know since the
Phone can
Have a little bit more horsepower
Infinity Blade 2 is coming to
And since Apple is the king
Of handheld gaming as so they claim
This week which is
You know the way they spin the numbers
Is interesting and I don't doubt it at all
But it's uh it's
It's interesting
Infinity Blade 2 becoming the iOS
December 1st of course
Is gonna look extra pretty on the 4s
But it will be I believe compatible with
Other devices as well
Of course why would you shut out your other
Exactly
So yeah very
Interesting though
Well I want to go back to Siri for a minute
Because I forgot about this little commercial I had seen
On Facebook and so far that was floating
Around the internet and then Tiger Cloud just linked it in
Chat and this does have to do with
Gaming a little bit this is a commercial
For the new Siri feature
On the iPhone 4s take a listen
Read me the message
New message from Kay bad news
Combustible lemons failed
And you meet us at 10
Reply definitely I'll see you there
Play my running mix
Oh joy
What's the traffic like around here
The traffic will be slow and meaningless
Just like your sad little life
Text my wife I'm gonna be 30 minutes late
She won't mind she doesn't really love you anyway
Is it going to be chilly in San Francisco this weekend?
Not too cold
Your few extra pounds should be suitable insulation
To keep you warm
What about Napa Valley
I hear it's beautiful there
Unlike you
How many cups are in 12 ounces
Let me think
Do you really need to make those extra cupcakes
Set my timer for 30 minutes
Okay 30 minutes and counting
Until I end your sad attempt at a life
New notification from Sandy Chen
Are we still on for dinner tonight
Perhaps you should have a snack instead
You're looking a little heavy
Reply sure I'll be there
Here's your reply to Sandy Chen
Sure I will be there
Me and my extra 20 pounds
Stand
Well tell me what I say
Interesting because I remember when Apple announced FaceTime
It was a huge thing that they used
They used deaf people in the commercial
And it really did make you think
Wow that's a big advance for deaf folks
But this one the Siri thing uses blind people
To be sending the text messages
Which is very very interesting
I think it's very neat
You wouldn't know it from that parody commercial
Because all the jokes are about weight
But I just thought that was neat
Definitely gets you thinking about some of these advances in technology
Anyhow
Let's move on with some more
Gaming news and this one
Has to do with the French
A French court has banned
A DS game copier
Prosecutors won an appeal
This was two years after
French courts actually ruled
That DS flash cartridge sellers were okay
Well the Paris court of appeals
Actually has now ruled against
The DS flash cartridge sellers
These various companies
That sell devices like the
R4 device which I think you all know
What that is
Nintendo I guess said that the companies
Have been charged 460,000 euros
In criminal fines
And 4.8 million in damages
To Nintendo
Yikes
So hmm
I guess Nintendo has been taking action on piracy
All over the globe
And they even have a site I love it
There was a site with a very
Angry looking Mario on it
That discusses the piracy
Thought it was interesting
So there you go
It's a thing
And you know what?
I wonder if there will be an appeal to the appeal
That would be what would be next right?
It is the French Rob
I mean please
They'll have to surrender all their copying devices immediately
I couldn't resist
Don't get mad
I'm not mad
I see it
You look great
Whoo
What a game of the week
Are we the throughout guards
You have 30 seconds we got a suggestion
Our hot in
Come open the video
I need that
Come open the video
AB.
that came out in 1983 when I was years old I love the music in this game a
little too happy I think well anyway um it was put up by Namco and in the u.s. it
was manufactured and distributed by Valley Midway it is a side-scrolling
platformer that has a police mouse and some cats and Mappy basically the game
runs on Namco's super pac-man hardware so that's and they modified it to have
the horizontal scrolling and it comes from the bulb at least according to the
article it says that it's derived from the term mapo which is a slightly
insulting name for a policeman whoo so anyway basically you run through a
mansion with all these cats club new keys or in the u.s. they were called
meow keys and you rescue stolen goods you go left and right and you can jump
on these trampolines that will bounce you to different floors and you have one
button that lets you open and close doors so you can get a radio 400 points
a television for 200 a computer for 300 the Mona Lisa for 400 and a safe for 500
but they come in pairs wait how many copies of the Mona Lisa exist I have no
friggin clue not in Mappy land which is another game ha ha there was a Mappy
land hi there was and it's sitting in my room in the vault so at any rate if you
get one item and then get its pair you actually get a score multiplier so the
more of those that you get without dying the bigger the multiplier gets so you
want to start off at the lowest and go to the highest you can actually get 8500
points and so moving for yeah he bounces on trampolines that are in the house
because I don't know why a mansion has trampolines in it but it does and Mappy
because they're fun Mappy and the cats can only land on a floor on the way up
not on the way down but if they pass the air the cats won't hurt Mappy but if
they run into him when he's on the plot on a platform then he will lose a life
and the trampolines can break if you jump on them four times in a row they'll
change colors so basically as you go through the game there is a boss in the
game called nyamco which is basically a play on the word namco and nyanco which
is like kitty cat but in the u.s. he was named Goro and he's faster but a little
less aggressive and so you can he'll actually hide behind different objects
so if you go over the object that he's hiding behind you get a thousand points
for having caught him so it's kind of cool you've got different hallways like
I said you can open and shut doors and keep the mukies out and you have
microwave doors which release sound waves that will sweep the kitty cats
away did you say microwave doors yeah microwave doors they made popcorn
sounds wish that they were like I always consider them to be like sound waves
which makes more sense to me but apparently they're microwaves so good
thing so um basically after every bonus round you did get bonus rounds after the
every fourth level so it's a bonus round and so that's basically you running
around on trampolines popping different balloons and nyamco is hidden somewhere
in there and after the bonus run you get a new feature in the gameplay after the
first one you get attics although there's nothing in them you get after
the seventh bonus level you get bells so you can get bells that freeze the cats
300 points for each and a thousand points for stunning nyamco you also get
hurry signs you know that tell you speed the fuck up you get rainbow floors after
the 11th which basically they're mini floors they vanish and they leave a hole
in the hallway sorry I didn't mean to interrupt if you guys are doing any
excess downloading kill it because we're having buffering problems the live
listeners are anything I'm gonna tell anything that's out of my control then
yeah our upload will upload and then kind of freeze on a number for a minute
and then keep going and it's causing the listeners to be all like what's going on
all right well I closed a few things so maybe that'll help right but anyway you
just get all these different bonuses including the Rainbow Force and dead ends
there are 256 rounds just like impact man and the last one is normal but
harder than usual and if you finish it it's also known as round zero the first
round starts over again it came out in the Famicom and the nest of course and
the MSX in 1984 there was a video game console version only I'm sorry console
only version that was called Mappy land which we've discussed it came out in
1986 it was also released from Microsoft revenge of the arcade for PC in 1998 and
then there were Japanese only sequels that were hopping Mappy that came out in
the arcade and Mappy kids for the Famicom in the late 1980s there's Mappy
arrangement that came out in the Namco classics volume one which I've got the
Famicom version of the original Mappy was re-released in Japan as part of the
Famicom miniseries in 2004 Mappy is included on the miss pac-man collection
and it's also featured in the Namco Museum 50th anniversary collection that
came out on Xbox and on the GameCube PC and PlayStation 2 but not on the GBA and
the Namco Museum DS it was also a part of Pacman's arcade party and it's
playable on PSP version of Namco Museum battle collection and there's a version
of it for the Palm OS there's also one for dot s and it's also on virtual
console as far as other references now this I think is kind of cool some people
have caught that it's actually Mappy is a playable character in Namco Super Wars
on the wonders one color you can get a Mappy hat and Namco cross Capcom in Ridge
Racer there's the RT blue Mappy team and the RT peak Mappy team there Mappy is
playable in Pac-Man World Rally on PSP in r4 there again is racing teams that
are the Mappy teams Mappy is in quick spot which is a North American in the
North American version Mappy land is the theme in Donkey Konga 3 and Technic
Beat and Mappy is also in no B no B boy as a resident of Jupiter why Jupiter no
freaking clue and that's it that's Mappy all right there it is your classic game
of the week is Mappy yeah all right and it's available of course in the arcades
primarily but also on a hell of a lot of retro collections that dark soccer

Loki wants to start us off all right well there's a new project headed up by
Kenji Inafune and it's revealed as a game called king of pirates and that's
coming to the 3ds in 2012 now not too much has been asked by it's a a pirate
action game it takes place on a giant ocean it looks very similar to maybe
like a Zelda type game or something like that and it is I guess published by
marvelous a a QL the makers of the harvest moon series and right now it's
only slated for Japan but who knows maybe it'll eventually come out over
here in North America so that's pretty cool let's see these actually working on
something other than you know nothing since he got canned from Capcom or he
left Capcom whatever uh la noir the team behind it team Bondi is shutting down I
can see why I can see in this that game I think was delayed and delayed and
delayed and delayed and delayed some more but how that would be the delay
music here there how's that different from any other freaking video game out
there it's like years I mean I don't know but anyways um apparently though
they're seeing that la noir was you know a big hit obviously however though
because it was in development for seven years it took its toll on the staff in
the company because of that they're just kind of dissolving that is a long damn
time for a game to be in the studio entered in administration in August and
its assets are being sold to an Australian production company Kennedy
Miller Mitchell so yeah it is being closed and then finally this is kind of
cool battlefield 3 is gonna ship on multiple this on xbox 360 and you know
they have one you know disc is dedicated for the single player and then the
second disc is multiplayer but also on that second disc is something else it is
an optional install that you can do that only give you high res it will be a
higher resolution texture pack so make the game look prettier if you want to
install it to your hard drive that's kind of neat I think that's kind of cool
that's really smart so maybe that will make things look a little bit better I'm
assuming it probably pretty much the same as playstation 3 since obviously
blu-ray discs have a lot more storage space but that is kind of cool if you're
gonna have to despise utilize all of the space right that's a neat idea wonder
if other companies will copy that in the future like rage all right well let's
move on to a story about VVVVVV and this is about the VVVVVV on the 3ds we're
talking about this earlier yep you heard me VVVVVV on the 3ds and it's supposed
to be out later this year so we're not talking about something next year it's
later this year it's supposed to be available on the 3ds e-shop and it will
have some 3d effects now you have to remember VVVVVV is based off of a it's
not based off of it it's highly inspired by a Commodore 64 game so that's the
style of the graphics so I'm very curious what exactly they're gonna 3d
ties with this I'm assuming the sprites are in front textures and back I don't
know so we'll see what they do with the 3d effects on this also the way they
will utilize the double screen is that the bottom touchscreen will always show
the map and the top screen will show the game that you're used to how do you
think that'll look on a 3ds I think it'd be cool but I'm worried though because
being that the game is very frustrating and you may want to throw your controller
throwing the 3ds is probably not a good idea yeah not a good idea they need to
put like a little attachment on a 3ds it's like a stress squeeze ball
something you can squeeze and get really pissed off so all right also information
about Mario Kart 7 which is exciting coming out on the 3ds soon Mario Kart
7 the Donkey Kong Returns folks that's right retro studios apparently actually
helped develop the Donkey Kong Returns themed level in the game which I think
is really cool so that's yep some of the stuff they helped with on the game so I
and I like I can see a little bit of the track in here and it looks pretty cool I
do like the whole like Mario's has a different variety of cars and the
hang gliders and all that although Loki's not as much of a fan I think
it'll be kind of cool and I noticed in this one Donkey Kong is riding like this
giant tractor looking thing which looks funny they've had different types of
cars before in the other games it's just stupid but never that flies where they
fly now big deal all right in a fun a cagey in a fun a who of course was the
producer of Megaman and he's also done dead rising he doesn't work at Capcom
anymore but he's wait are we am I am I double repeating a story that you
already did I believe you are I believe I am Rob you way out of practice shame
on me all right well then I'll just skip that we'll go to Dark Sakura how did
that happen Disney trademarks castle of illusion which was an old you know
Genesis game but it was castle illusion starring Mickey Mouse and it is targeted
at a video game software so maybe they're gonna re-release it who knows
maybe we get in a virtual console also rock band there is going to be a
Facebook milestone celebration with Stevie Wonder who it's actually since
their Facebook page tops 2 million likes harmonics is letting the news out and
saying the rock band 3s DLC is going to be going into let's see we have Stevie
Wonder Coldplay Breaking Benjamin and dream theater which having some dream
theater on there that's pretty awesome cuz like I know five people who know who
dream theater is that's pretty cool and last but never least Steven Spielberg
and DreamWorks are backing a halo movie to come out in 2000 false and let me
finish thank you for getting sorry it was stated to Microsoft denied that it
was in development they go on record saying that it is inaccurate and they
have no plan for halo feature right now their focus is developing halo
anniversary in halo 4 we all know it's gonna happen eventually though well I
mean someday it'll be terrible but then again you know I've talked a lot about
the Wow movie before and the World of Warcraft movie I don't think that's ever
gonna happen at this point like I think they they missed their chance a couple
years ago that sound like a terrible idea well it could have been good but it
probably would have been we all know would have been all right guys and we
have some big stuff to share you ready we're gonna make a phone call to our old
friend why why are who's gonna talk to us about his upcoming project that he's
doing on xbox live indie games we're gonna call right now hello zero zero
one two three four five six what that's what it says on the caller ID I was
Skype is really funny when it does that it's it's funny things over the call ID
so why why are how are you doing sir um I think I'll be better once I have time
to get some sleep but I am kind of excited for New York comic-con later
this week and I'm just doing doing what I can to you know get get done what I
need to do on the two games I'm showing you know so that I don't look like
complete crap when I'm there so yeah you you've been doing a lot of these
conventions and I I bet that's been a really good kind of exposure and help
for you because you know I know I knew you were at PAX East a while ago and I
think you did it again actually twice now yeah now you got the comic-con
coming up it's it's pretty exciting so it is and I'll tell you honestly I
haven't gotten a single major gaming site to cover me yet and I'm hoping
maybe it'll be different this time but to be completely honest I think the
major reason I'm doing it is just to put my put my stuff in front of gamers and
to see them you know enjoy playing my stuff like to have a bunch of people
crowded around snake 360 battle mode you know that that gets me every time like I
love to see that that's all right even if even if there's no chance that I'll
be commercially successful just seeing that is enough for me to be honest screw
the big game sites you don't get any much you got us you got us we got your
back all right so speaking of which um you you are you said you're gonna be
showing two games in New York comic-con right so what's what what's the one
we're already supposed to know about well the first one is the latest
available build of snake 361 and right obviously the sequel to snake 360 and
there's a lot of stuff a lot of stuff that's going to be in the new one I mean
levels that grow in the campaign because I got criticized about well you know
snake is a game about avoiding yourself and well as soon as you get long enough
where it's a challenge the levels done and then you start over so in this game
you know the campaign has levels that grow as you do and then your challenge
to continue going at the length that you're at through a two three four even
more part level so that's one thing and then there are other things like
survival mode there's still the traditional one but then there's a you
know three and five minute you know score rush where you know you're gonna
have to take more risks because you only have that much time and then there's
something that's really unique and really fun called dual survival and the
way that works is every time you take a target you turn around you reverse
direction oh god oh you always have to be keeping track of where your head and
your tail are it's a lot of fun and it's a really really great challenge my I
love how you've kind of taken the concept of snake from the old-school
cell phones and just turned it into this just complex game in a way you know it's
not all actually you know you've given it some more dimensions you know you
should feel a battle mode now there's there's even more modifiers there's like
I'm gonna have seven modifiers available at comic-con and you can turn them all
on if you want and it's just like you know everything from dead players
remaining on the field when you die to again reversing direction every time you
take a target to the level continuously shrinking it's it's just got a lot of
stuff in there and but the one of the new things I'm premiering at comic-con
is something called the challenge mode eventually they're going to be a hundred
different challenges but at comic-con they're just ten and it's just you know
a scenario okay you're here you're in this level you have to do this you have
this much time you have this many movements here are the restrictions okay
go and I'm also gonna have a contest if there's anybody who can clear the four
hardest challenges that I bring with me in five attempts they can win a year of
lives but to be honest I don't think anyone's going to be able to rule you
throwing down the gauntlet all right nice someone thinks they can come prove
me wrong then they're they're quite welcome nice by the way why we are is
live with us this isn't a pre-recorded thing so if you have questions in our
chat room go ahead and ask them chat orange launch radio.com I know you're
really excited about snake 361 and and so are we it's it's looking to be a
great game but I got to tell you I want to talk about project number two well
you know what the seeds for project number two were planted a long time
ago if you can recall shortly after you know sneak 360 came out and I talked
about it right here on OLR you know what one of the weeks like immediately after
that you know you guys were throwing around some ideas and it's funny I don't
have the chat log but I do distinctly remember that someone was like hey why
why are get on that and at the time I didn't but I was just thinking about it
and and sometime this summer I said you know what I think I'm going to get on it
so I threw together a trailer last night that you know kind of brings back brings
back something about you know that it basically I have your discussion in
there and yeah it's really the trailer speaks for itself it speaks better than
I ever could so why don't we take it away then I'm gonna play this year in
studio the trailer and I think you're gonna link it for our chatters if they
want to see it and we will also now I know I thought originally this is a
YouTube but it's not so we'll figure out a way to get it on tumblr for the
podcast easy just uploaded it's a direct it's a direct link to an mp4 download on
my site to be honest most people when they click on it either it'll just play
or they'll be able to download it to their desktop there'll be a very very
very brief delay while it downloads because it's not very big and then it'll
play so you know for most people and of course mp4 is a format that pretty much
everybody can play most phones even should be able to handle it so I'll get
it on the tumblr and I'm sure people can figure it out we got smart listeners so
here it is the world premiere of the secret project the yyr has been working
on that apparently we have had a hand in unknowingly so here we go start off here
of course now I just have to wait for the buffering I just have to wait for
the buffering now I should have loaded this in advance yeah shame on me good
job you'll live you'll learn this is this would have been a great time to
talk about more are you doing any other live appearances this year besides New
York comic-con next after this is going to be magfest in January alright which
is in the DC area and it's just one big orgasm of gaming and music and gaming
related music and it's just it's amazing hold on loaded it loaded we gotta play
it I've never seen so many video games in a room before it loaded here we go
we on the DS there it return the ferret I command II need to put it like on a bungee cord
you just put it on a bungee cord so every time you throw it you can yank it back it's
not that I should be encouraging you to do this well wait you know what they
need to do wait since we've been talking community games and all this stuff and
and all this good Xbox I think shouldn't they have a game called bungee ferret
tossing it could be like orange launch radio presents bungee ferret toss add
this to the list of orange launch radio dream games or no I add this to the
list of orange launch radio reality games I would like to see about the
dream game we need to learn how to program or something have a series of
games that are soccer you're in school helping take a class on programming
our ferret engineers have created time ferrets with a two-second views this is
great and you've got a guy dangling from a helicopter and he is throwing ferrets
that explode that explode in bloody messes on the unsuspecting people below
who are shooting at you who are shooting missiles at you while you fly around it
is bungee ferret tossing inspired by olr for better or worse it will be playable
at New York comic-con coming to Xbox 360 later this year from I guess a new
division that you're working with MRG yeah well it's you know what I came up
with an alternate name MRG mostly random games and because basically like my
label while our games have always been about just straight-up serious arcade
style games right and well this is anything but serious so I wanted to just
separated slightly I understand I understand I understand I'm having so
much fun with this like and everyone who's tried it so far really loves the
concept and to be completely honest the graphics like they're as with my other
games they're nothing special and I'm considering having a lot of them
redrawn by someone a little more professional than me but it's everyone
who's tried it so far they really like the way it plays because basically the
thing is you're fighting terrorism of course the ferrets have to fight I want
to make you a flyer he's got New York comic-con coming up Friday you should
always probably had I actually have something in the printer and by the way
there's a big red box on it that says you know the concept of bungee carrot
tossing is a joke never throw an animal in real life it's good knowing PETA on
your ass unless you can assure me he'll just land with a splat she's too heavy
to throw although it could be completely honest I wouldn't be a hundred percent
sad if PETA was on my ass because they say any publicity is good publicity
right that's true so what so what are you controlling in the game are you
controlling the helicopter well this is a great example I think of a game that
would not be possible in its current form on a smartphone or on something that
doesn't have you know thumbsticks and buttons this is this is going to be I
think a great you know piece of ammo in the war on you know oh well cell phones
can do everything smartphones can do all kinds of games because basically the way
this game works is using the left thumb stick you control the helicopters
movement and using the right thumb stick you can control the guy you know the
dude I call them hanging on the end of the helicopter if you push the right
stick up and down you can control the cord length doesn't dude name and right
you can swing wait we need to give dude a name like the hero needs a name
Fernando Fernando sure okay I don't like the apple song yeah the drums Fernando
his name is Fernando I guess we named your guy Fernando yes I'm writing it
down for SSJ 100 Matt here with me actually right if he's a little surprised
that I'm writing it down but you know what I'm gonna forget it how could you
forget about a song that's kidding well I got so much stuff I'm actually I
started the day with no music and sound effects in the game now they're all done
and I have to put them in so it's been busy but yeah so anyway Fernando here
he's fighting terrorists we discover the location of their base in the dead
but the thing is they have advanced stealth radar detection technology so we
can't send in the army so instead we send in one stealth helicopter and
Fernando who is armed with the latest in ferret weapons technology now you know
how they have in movies they have like oh let's show the schematics and you get
this screen with like a green grid and on top there's some kind of wireframe
image of some you know complicated technology in in the opening sequence
when it's eventually done you're gonna see that except it's just going to be
ferret dynamite that is amazing third weapons technology and then at the end
of the game you realize that the terrorists have somehow reverse
engineered the ferret weapons technology and they attempt to use it on you so you
know that that's an exciting little thing waiting for you at the end of the
game although there's there may be depending on time an alternate boss at
the end of hard mode that actually Matt here came up with and it's just as
ridiculous as the game concept itself and hopefully I can get that in there so
you all can laugh at it well I gotta say I am just sure me stat but on behalf of
all of us I'm just like I'm like I'm tickle seriously yeah I think tickled is
the right word like just tickled that one of our dream game ideas is fucking
happening I know and it's all you buddy we're not gonna sue you over using our
idea or whatever we say you are in the money so keep it we're not gonna chase
after you we know we know you're gonna you're gonna plug us somewhere and it's
it's all good it's gonna be a whole lot of money from the dollar games I put out
but if I do see any volume of money at the very least I'll make a trip out
there and I'll buy you guys a beer ha ha ha ha yes hold around hold on I love
beer we only drink hard liquor at least I know I just I haven't tried on six
months to buy Jamie a beer I'll get you something harder just give me a just give
me a rob would like to be a fruity drink virgin pina colada all right look you
would like ten shots of tequila the trailer is out there we're gonna post
the link to our tumblr as well our chatters are like just do want OMG XD I'd
buy that for a dollar have you determined that price yet it will be a
dollar a dollar okay so like seriously guys it's a whole dollar and you always
have those leftover points anyway for when you buy the big points and buy
rock band songs I have a dollar left over actually I could pay a dollar for
bungee ferrets so I am I am legit excited any idea on a release timeframe
or too soon to tell you're just kind of demoing it right now I am going to be
rushing my butt off to have it out by the end of the year beyond that I don't
have an absolute clue however you can know for certain that I will be here
letting you know what that is absolutely because I feel like you know
all our in this game are kind of tied together so I know I were tickled you
will listen to or you will know first when it's coming out all right oh I like
that now awesome we will take you up on that deal and we will absolutely be
following up with you in future weeks best of luck on programming with the
project and all the tireless nights you put in have a kick-ass time in New York
Comic Con I wish I was going to be there but I I won't sadly because I I didn't
know it's gonna be a bunch of it's gonna be in New York Comic Con definitely
stop by and give it a shot and tell me what you think and give me all your
feedback good bad ugly whatever awesome while I are thanks again for coming on
the show tonight and we'll be talking to you again soon thank you so much for
having me all right everybody pleasure all right thank you take care bye bye
why we are in his games he's the guy behind such games like snake 360 and now
snake 361 falling and now bungee ferret tossing is gonna be awesome looking
forward to that all right um what'd you guys think isn't that great that's
that's the most awesome thing of our Loki Loki was convinced it was gonna be
grandma's got guns I was hoping maybe you know but here's the thing here's the
thing if this game does really well like like imagine if it's like on the top of
the sales bar and we I think we have a responsibility to get the word out and
make sure that this does top the sales charts then what's gonna happen is
people are gonna be like wow this game is going good wow those people olr like
full are really good ideas we need to start adapting some of their other games
and have puzzle sluts blow shit up they're all on the wiki that that's out
there and and a lot of times inspired by you guys and somebody's update our wiki
to let you know them know that we've actually got a reality yes if somebody
has and what's now had a text-based game we did we it's not the first olr
inspired game but this is gonna be the first one that you it's on our dream
list you can play on a console that's gonna be awesome and it's so somebody
just need to put patent-pending yyr on that yeah he has programmed it and we
have said we will not sue him right we're not gonna sue him over that we
think it's great that he's uh he's running with it so awesome you know
since you're mentioning games and making stuff I thought it was kind of cool I
actually checked out there is this I happen there's a link or an article or
whatever they got it didn't make our show roll it's about a the new my low
ponies thing there's a fighting game that someone's making oh yeah I heard
about this okay okay well they're using a you know the old it's a fighter or 2d
fighter maker I guess is about the same people did RPG maker anyways in
searching for 2d fighter maker I came across of this engine it's called engine
zero zero one and it's actually something similar to that where you can
make your own games but the other thing that they're also adding is Android and
iOS support so you'll be able to publish your own games your own iPod games
without any programming knowledge Wow wouldn't that be fun oh boy Loki's eyes
are lighting up okay awesome all right well um we'll keep you guys posted on
that it's I just man I just this show going into its tenth year next year it's
like now we have we've won a podcast award you know even though some time ago
we've got nominated again we've had a PC game a text-based adventure written on
us and now we have like an actual like console graphical thing like a like a
more for lack of better term like legit thing you're gonna be able to buy on
your console that's inspired by our show it's just it's amazing like like it's
like the ultimate compliment for real for real so so excited well I don't know
how we follow this with more gaming news but that's what we're gonna do so Loki
good luck all right I will I'll try to make it significant so there's an
interesting patent that Microsoft is working or has right now that's points
to a possible connect based parental controls and what it's gonna do is it's
actually gonna look at your proportion tracking your body skeleton that kind of
stuff to figure out what age you were probably you know it's gonna take a best
guess I guess neat idea I guess but I see a ton of flaws with this one
couldn't a child simply unplug the Kinect and boom problem solved no need
for parental controls whatsoever and the only way this would really work is if
it's actually physically built into the console and then the other thing is what
about the short people or you know midgets if you will you know what about
them that's not good I don't know I just don't think anything's gonna happen with
this but it's a neat concept I guess but once again and once again it really it
comes down to our parents gonna set up these parental controls in the first
place that's true it's probably gonna be more complex to set up but this
discriminates against midgets because gonna scan a little person and it's
gonna think it's a child and say no porn for you that is said I mean this is one
of those things is like I guess it's an interesting idea but at the end of the
day it's also kind of dumb because you know what parental control you should
have in your house at all times apparent it is apparent isn't it yes it is very
apparent that you should have a parent ha unless you were me as a child moving
on I want to move on I don't have to move on why do we always have to know
I've gotten fine how about minecraft shit just gonna stop how's that sound
we'll just stop no we're not ready for minecraft shit are we yes no we're not
we haven't done mailbag yet oh damn look at you look at you trying to cheat try
to reminder did you see the ad for the show where every gamer has a boy yeah
well well a voice there's no voices in a mailbag it's text all right yeah leave a
message I want a voice I think this is a little bit like too late I think but I
don't know I want to share this anyway but okay you guys heard about the whole
thing where Sony and EA they updated their terms of service so that you can't
take them to a class-action lawsuit anymore and the only way you could get
out of the class-action lawsuit was to send a letter well there's a website
that was created called gamers opt out which was basically a site that you
could fill in information online and they would send it in for you
interesting so hmm and I guess there was some concern at first that a legal
person had registered this website but turned out after some investigation it's
not at some some dude up in Michigan who's just really mad about this like a
lot of people are really and it's a pretty interesting concept the only
bummer is that Sony term of service thing happened already like six weeks
ago at this point wasn't it hold on yes it happened but that is only if you've
agreed to it and you can only agree to it if you've updated your system if you
haven't updated your system you haven't made any sort of agreement yet I would
just assume that most people have done that by now but I guess if you haven't
for whatever reason then you could still use this like I haven't because I
haven't played a PlayStation 3 online for ever so I think it's a neat concept
you know and I hey if somebody's gonna do the work for me I'm all for it but at
the end of the day you know why does Sony get to set all the rules in regards
to what you can and can't do legally like yes I know there's a Supreme Court
precedent and all that stuff but I don't know it just kind of seems wrong but at
the same time what do class-action lawsuits really accomplish either like
everybody gets a coupon or everybody gets like 50 cents you know usually
class-action lawsuits don't end with with much of anything so that's why I'm
not as mad about it but it does kind of it's more of a principle it's more the
principle I think at the end of the day yeah and when you know really how often
do you know do you or I actually file a lawsuit against a company I mean right
never right well sometimes you jump in on class-action lawsuits though yeah but
that's because you don't really have to do anything yeah what's the worst it's
gonna happen I'm not gonna lose any money so might as well you know see if I
get something but I think that's really the only reason people jump in on this
stuff but I mean I would think if Sony did something to piss me off and let's
say they just you know sold my house underneath me and you know took all my
assets or something like that for some sort of weird claws or something that
they had I can't see myself really suing them I'd just be like well I'm just not
gonna buy your next console or game or whatever you know that you have all
right well we're gonna move on to dark soccer's favorite part of the show let
me get her properly riled up for the mailbag you got to see this this picture
dark soccer meekly top so you know who to blame he sent this to me from
Facebook and it was labeled girls version of an Xbox you ready it's a
picture of an oven she has her finger up I only forgive him because he introduced
me to that band that I like now you mad there actually is I never knew this on
Facebook there actually is a page called the girl version of an Xbox that's for
donk so email first email hold on now that I ever properly riled up to reach
your emails at mailbag at orange lounge radio.com men suck it's totally sexist
I'm sorry it's it's wrong and really funny shut up and read the email well
you know what you know how long ago was the fucking movie I mean seriously does
anyone shut up that's just like you know your challenge radio gods I just wanted
to chime in on the Final Fantasy 10 remake discussion from last week's show
personally I'm excited extremely excited about this Final Fantasy 10 is my
favorite RPG ever not only is the battle system fun and has really awesome
awesome summons that are actually useful unlike Final Fantasy 13 but the game has
an emotional musical score and a storyline with compelling character cast
I don't understand why people complain about the voice of Titus or even the
character itself for one thing I love hearing his narrations and thoughts on
how you go through the story which reminds me of kiln and the melancholy of
Haruhi Suzumiya kind of and for people who have a problem with the character
itself he's just being realistic people he asks a lot of questions and gets
emotionally stressed because one he's in a world unknown to him and to the other
characters do keep a lot from him until later in the story and when something as
important as a loved one self-sacrifice it can take quite a toll on someone give
squirts off to break for having a character we can somewhat relate to geez
and this one's directed to me and Jamie I completely agree with you on Final
Fantasy 10 to the game is just loads of fun and the gestures make it really
interesting in all honesty if you were a person who loved Final Fantasy tactics
with the different classes and Final Fantasy 7 active time battle system then
there is no reason you shouldn't have fun with this game unless you hate
Charlie's Angels with all of your being also a thousand words is one of my
favorite Final Fantasy songs one more note about on the Final Fantasy 10 vs.
7 remake argument that people keep on having let's look at it this way Final
Fantasy 7 got a prequel a cell phone game a shooter an anime a movie and a
special edition of the movie with more scenes Final Fantasy 10 got a sequel and
that's it let's spread the love around people thanks for reading Oscar ps Rob
did you ever finish Final Fantasy 13 no I'm like in the last chapter and I never
finished it cuz I suck but I keep thinking about doing that too I really
want to play 13 too so I think I need to finish but at least I know I have until
what like January or February hey you want to hear something funny since I'm
gonna be real the show right now sure um I'm gonna read a book what yeah you're
like me we know you can read that was my middle finger going up Wow so in the
last five minutes dark soccer's finger went up Loki's finger went up now
everybody in chat room guess when's my finger gonna go up right now no it's uh
it's something completely appropriate ready player one it's basically kind of
the way I've I think the story is like is it's very much like Charlie and the
Chocolate Factory meets a bunch of 80s references and a bunch of sci-fi video
game references basically this guy has this kind of think of it like Second
Life this giant universe cyberspace that people go to and he's gonna die but he's
leaving it for the person that finds this key in the thing and so this kid
from the ghetto or whatever builds this computer and ends up trying to go in
there to find the key so it's very much like you know Charlie Chocolate Factory
but there's you know references to all things like sci-fi and video games and
stuff like you know they've got the the owl ship from Watchmen in there the
DeLorean movie out of this like the movie oh they are okay but it's just
really it sounds cool and that's like part of the plot for spiral yeah my wife
was very surprised that I would read a book and I don't read but I don't read
books very often I used to I used to read sci-fi books and like you're like
me I I used to read books all the time when I was growing up like I used to
love the scary books like that was what was his name Christopher Pike goosebumps
is that the guy no it was different well maybe Arl Stein yeah I was a Pike Pike
the name Arl Stein and yeah his books I used to read a lot of those and I read I
read some other stuff too you should see the book that I finished in two days
actually I liked a lot of even though I hear he was a total asshole I liked a
lot of the rolled all stuff like Charlie Chocolate Factory in glass elevator and
and James the giant peach and the boy I think the boy who ruled the world
something like that well maybe if it's good I will loan you the book afterwards
after my wife reads it cuz she's supposed to read it well hopefully
somebody will buy me an iPad so I can play with gadgets when I read books it's
not that I by the way it's not that I'm like reading sucks it's just that the
internet has kind of like like instead of reading I pull up Wikipedia on my
phone and I'm just looking at Wikipedia articles like that's kind of what it's
turned into like my reading is now what attention span theater see the stuff
that I've actually started reading it again lately is reading anthropology
studies I'm not I've never been a fan of historical fiction so I put down one
historical fiction I was reading but I like I've been reading cultural books
and the book I just finished was geisha by Liza Dalby she actually worked as a
geisha in the 70s it's her doctoral thesis so that's what I've been reading
lately it's not that I hate reading I just have a really short attention span
but apparently it's good it is it is actually on the iOS bookstore whatever
it's actually in what it's on the New York Times bestsellers list right now
so okay if you like I mean that Kotaku actually was the one that kind of turned
me on to that they ran an article about the book and with some screen it wasn't
it was concept art I think for a screenplay because he's wrote a
screenplay for it as well that will probably become a movie but well and I
was wrong it's not that it sounds like spiral is that it sounds like the third
book loop in the virus the ring the ring spiral and loop it sounds kind of like
loop yeah but with video game references yeah all right let's get back to the
emails here we go okay um the first one's from Holly we got two from Holly
but they're short so Molly says you were forgiven PS I ate your Xbox connector
cables what is that uh it was because Loki was talking about the dog but that
was like a month ago remember Loki yeah I think about the dog's gonna die soon
she sent us a picture terrible she sent us a picture of her dog oh I see the
dog so come on I didn't say the dog would die soon and I hope it doesn't I'm
just saying oh oh my god is it or a freaking corgi Molly I'm gonna put your
dog on our tumbler that is I love the dogs name is Molly I meant I said Holly
oh okay sorry name is Molly the dog's name is Molly I was speaking to Holly
wait him it's Holly for real it's Holly and Molly yeah Molly's a good name from
the cuteness dog ever sue shut orgies are awesome no court if I own a dog I
don't a corgi my favorite gift ever is the army of corgis okay so then I love
the little corgi that jumps in the water have you seen it the court yes okay so
the next email I know this is like my fourth email this week but I'm just
passing this on for your new segment this is a really clever way to get
people to resub even though I had let my sub lapse because I'm playing Guild Wars
right now I hopped right on this and reset when I saw it basically it's rift
offering replies for the long replies rewards for the longer that you say
subscribe in the form of gear Oh interesting so like here and not like
pets and things that's interesting so like six months sanctuaries guard which
is a helm you get a personal vendor which we've got one of those in our
guild you get like some swords for 18 months you get gauntlets and greaves and
tricorn of the drowned I'm gonna absolutely know whatever I mean is you
and you get something called the endless skull helm that's just a cool name so
yeah it's like basically there's an end to it that is false advertising stop
moving on well hold on hold on guys say everybody wow does something kind of
similar with the whole like anniversary gifts I mean but they're not like just
for longtime subscribers I don't know I gotta talk about MMOs real quick though
because and I'm just gonna totally publicly talk about a private
conversation I don't even care me Glatov do you know what game he got for free
from some little manager thing or whatever yeah Final Fantasy 14 what so
he got it for free and he's been playing it remember how fun has he 14 like we
all played it and during the beta we're like this game is shit but they I didn't
they've tweaked a lot of stuff and he's telling me like it's more like 11 now
but it's actually really pretty he's like you should play and I'm like but
this is Shane we're talking about and he's really good at making people do
things they don't want to do so I don't know maybe I will have to try it well
hold on I'm just curious because you know it's kind of sucked and I'm
wondering how much it's going for you know $25 on Amazon if I'm not mistaken
and there's no monthly fee right now hmm really Oh Loki that Loki just went I
can't I seriously I can't even talk you might have won somebody I can't even fit
in enough game yes on eBay there's I am looking on eBay I'm just saying 1298
what used why would I buy a used copy of Final Fantasy 14 that's just stupid but
I mean sorry you brought up MMO as I had to almost so oh this one's to me
actually saw this thought of you may be a point for discussion if things are
really light this week not really the latest top 20 list from some of those
lucky people who get paid to sit around all day talking PR crap and getting paid
for it yes I'm jealous the headlines are focusing on the top three but I was
interested by the PlayStation being placed at 13 and intended reaching 16
with the Xbox not featuring is the Xbox really not cool apparently we don't
think so in the UK but yeah it's never going to stand up to the coolest levels
of an Aston haha true thanks care guys love your work Lee
everything cuz I hate the United States so much and you know Microsoft being a
US company and the other two being Japan these are the top 20 cool brands and
yeah the Aston Martin is number one okay so I'm just gonna fly through the list
in order and I can understand these okay so we have Aston Martin is number one
Apple Harley Davidson Rolex banging Olafson Blackberry Google Ferrari Nike
YouTube Alexander McQueen the designer Dom Perignon PlayStation Ray-Ban Chanel
why is PlayStation retired than Chanel fuckers
Nintendo Vivian times you're a real girl just saying Asian provocateur tape
modern Maserati Maseratis are butt ugly so yeah Aston Martin number one Maserati
should be like 42 so yeah all right cool story why cool story bodies aren't cool
you look cool in there put a fucking Bugatti on there that's what's cool and
Chanel should be right behind us to Martin cuz I'm sorry imagine decked out
and Chanel driving an Aston Martin I don't with an iPad I'm talking me that
would be epic all right let's move on yeah we got more emails okay a very
feminine James Bond okay this comes from zither who zither is actually my new
buddy now for introducing me to a different PC engine thingy so I listened
to episode 428 recently and near the end dark soccer was talking about the PC
engine and turbo graphics 16 emulation and mentioned magic engine I used to use
magic engine to emulate but later I came across an emulator that's a lot better
it's called Oh Taki oh it's oh oh ta ke and it was developed by Japanese guy
from what I remember hearing magic engine has some input lag which is a
common hindrance in emulators and Oh Taki Oh Taki has practically none at all
plus it's free as opposed to magic engine where you have to pay I'd say
it's very worthwhile emulator for the sole reason that it's free also I am
with dark Sakura and hoping that planet Harriers can get emulated just recently
someone managed to get Sega's model 3 hardware almost emulated and I hope that
another James can crack the Hikaru and emulate it too you were gonna say
something no I'm sorry I'm just Mouse being retarded no keep being one of the
best gaming podcasts out there I'm so glad I came across you guys I've been
listening to past shows where you discussed the money stuff also makes me
want to pick up step mania again even though I sucked at it back in high
school see there's my buddy now okay we have two more to go
hello our long-time listener first-time writer inner I know that all our is a
family and while gaming is our main passion we like to help people out okay
this one I decided I was gonna read because it's for extra life okay this is
an opportunity for o alarm me to combine the two today I'm writing in to help out
sick kids who don't have the lives we do I'll be participating in the extra life
gaming marathon on October 15th I'll attempt to gain for 24 hours to raise

with deepest gratitude I on a tropic and I will be doing the copy paste real
quick yeah I know there's actually a few people that listen to OLR because I've

life thing that's coming up next weekend I think even Irene who has gone by Rice
Princess on this show previously is doing this too so good luck to everybody
participating you know I'll do it too why don't we do it too it's too soon I
can't I'd like I like I would like to do something for charity but this
particular one is too soon I can't do it like this done that short notice as much
as I'd love to play video games for 24 hours the wife would not let me seen as
she would take care of the baby for 24 hours I would happily support other
people in their effort though absolutely as far as us maybe on a three-day
weekend at some point soon I would love to play game I screwed 24 hours I'd go

I'll just play all day and for every hour that I play you're just looking for
an excuse to play video games shut up well maybe maybe we'll do something
along the lines of whatever I happen to pull out of it I'll just send a dude
cool good good deal okay so moving forward last email good evening olr and
also guest hosts who didn't show up I'm being played she couldn't make it yeah
we ended up not having Tara she could make it's too bad yeah but I'll go
hurry the email um gaming week at Gears of War 3 Wow next week Wow Dark Souls
Rage back up home front new dick I'm done why do I why do I what like why do
we need to know you're gaming me now I'm kidding every gamer has a voice I was
just murdering after Dead Island um who do I talk to you about purchasing the
DTR freak domain name it would feel like I would be owning a piece of the past a
relic from a different time when I was younger anyways at this point all of our
posts on the form will be lost in time like tears in rain for the record
probably not because I'm sure Jason still has the the forum logs that would
be terrible to like troll it and just put like coming back soon and then just
never ever I don't ever I don't I don't see it being let go of honestly I don't
see being let go of either but let it be known if they if they are you've got
competition because if they do put that domain up for sale I want it and I will
I will put it put it to a legitimate purpose and will not sell it spam
whatever I I want it absolutely but I have a dog I know other people want it
too so I'm not holding my breath but if I could get it I would take it so moving
forward I mentioned this a year ago when a backlog turned into 30-plus titles is
it no longer a gaming backlog but a back jam and he shows us a picture of his
plates and says DDR player that's great and my the plates on my car is still
says DDR plyr but on my newer car 2010 Mazda mx-5 Miata shout out to all of our
peace and triple-a I hope you have triple-a if you've got a Miata shit get
some triple-a so yeah all right was that it for emails yes well if you want to
make Jamie work mailbag at orange lounge radio.com send us more email I will cut
a bitch if you yes we are reading emails again all right let's move on
Loki okay look he's already trying to see if the domains available I know I
know it's not somebody would have snatched up by now if it was there it is
that's right anyways so let's talk a little bit about Sony and you know they
have the phone brand Ericsson well they actually may be buying out Ericsson it's
interesting this is coming from the Wall Street Journal and apparently they're
gonna be buying out Ericsson the mobile phone company I guess they teamed up
with back in 2001 and of course they just recently released the Xperia play
through the Ericsson line and of course they're gonna have you know the new
PlayStation Vita and the phone stuff and they're gonna have you know the store to
go along with that well it's interesting because if Sony Ericsson you know
becomes just Sony mobile then basically the first thing they would do is you
have a PlayStation phone that's actually a PlayStation phone instead of just this
experience player some roundabout weird name like that which people still dub it
the PlayStation phone but if Sony actually has their own true phone company
then our phone you know hardware manufacturer that'd be kind of neat
they'd be joining up I guess against you know Apple even taking them on you know
headfirst be interesting I don't know has it worked for the computers because
they're damn fucking expensive yeah for real but apples are very expensive as
well people buy those that's true this is about just having that status well
there's a lot of games looking to be getting that same status as well you
know you kind of heard why we are talk about a little bit when he was on the
phone earlier is it sometimes it's kind of hard to get noticed and get coverage
on a lot of the big sites well Activision is trying to help some indie
games get exposure there's an indie games competition that they did before
and I guess what happened is that the publisher is going to be doing this
again offering two hundred and fifty thousand dollars to two indie developers
ownership of submission rights will remain with the creator they're very
important to put that in the press release and yeah there you go
Activision is working with IndieCade to actually do the contest and it'll be
open for submissions from now through December 31st that's awesome
hopefully can oh maybe yyr should submit bungee ferret tossing as you know the
future of gaming all right anyhow dark soccer what do you got for us well as I
brought up earlier when I was trying to skip doing of a mailbag
Minecraft has something new in it there have been screenshots released from work
in progress version that has dragons dragons so it's either supposed to go in
there or maybe not ever but the creator has been tweeting that texturing the
dragon was interesting so it looks kind of blocky like everything in Minecraft
does yeah dragons that's it all right it would be needs I guess I mean he keeps
adding more and more things to kill you in the game so I kind of probably would
impede on building stuff I would think the constant death my guess at least so
this is also cool since we were talking a little bit about indie games and stuff
on live is actually putting on some new indie games this fall and some of these
actually might recognize because they've been hitting different console platforms
as well as PC including orcs must die which was just released on Xbox Live
Arcade limbo magica bastion space chem and Avadon the Black Fortress and those
are on being added to already existing indie games that are on there including
braid trying world of goo and the mall so that's kind of cool that there will
be kind of a showcase of all sorts of games not just you know streaming games
awesome it's good that on live is actually getting more games because
that's kind of where they're hurting right now you know what I mean yeah so
it's always a good thing just a couple more stories for you guys then we're
going to go to the Twitter with twitter.com slash olr I haven't seen hardly
anything show up on there so maybe after I say that it will or also there's going
to be the skype line of course one eight seven seven game olr in just a moment I
guess this is interesting I a study was done by website bundle who tracks credit
card spending nice I'm sure that works but I guess they track all the
transactions or whatever and what the study did is that it looked at it looked
at games from EB and steam and GameStop and all these sales from July 2010 to
June 2011 and looked at the top 100 cities in the US by population the city
that bought the most games Huntington New York kind of random right yeah I
mean that's I'm assuming that's upstate certainly not you know the big city but
also in the list here locally at number five Modesto a laugh because like
Modesto's like it's halfway between here and Fresno like what else can I say
about Modesto was also on this you know what else was on the list Stockton was
stocked on list of Fresno's it not like they have much to do there Sacramento's
not even on the list a lot of these strike me as like suburb II things well
then again Pittsburgh's like number six so there are Chesapeake Virginia's
number four so there are some bigger cities that are on there I don't know
interesting Denver Virginia beaches at ten those are aren't they like right
near each other Miami think they are so there you go that's your list of game
oh yeah Stockton number 41 hello Stockton so I guess those are the big
cities that buy video games probably cuz there's nothing else to do and Rama says
Huntington is Long Island thank you sorry we're California kids we don't
know our East Coast geography as well Huntington is Long Island hmm all right
one more one more story I threw this in here at the last minute because it's
it's related to to music games and DDR which by the way I did a little research
on the DDR freak domain it's registered through July 2017 so we won't be getting
that anytime soon that's not surprising at all though I mean that site probably
still generates quite a bit of traffic even though it's not there did it ever
like come back up no or did the server get I know the servers are like getting
unplugged or whatever yeah it's it's not back up it's still just the demo just
goes to go daddy Wow and if you you know click on the the register it thing then
it has you go to one of those buy out a used domain theme was it expiring anyway
no I don't think so interesting we'll have to figure out what's going on huh
all right well anyway this story is about a movie that's happening it's a
3d movie and it's supposed to feature scenes from pump it up or whatever it's
targeted at tweens and teens and it's supposed to be about dancing game and a
girl who's bullied by her peers over I guess the lack of skills of the game
it's gonna have its premiere at the end of October in Burbank California but
like seriously look at this just look at this you guys based on true events
you see what she's wearing right now I look so much better than her it's not
even competition it's nothing personal super jets DX
this whole thing looks like it was shot in front of a green screen
you know what that looks like to me to be real like this is the arc music
factory equivalent of movies is what this is and you just say enjoy your rep
Rebecca black music on your way to watch this premiere if you go like I don't
care that it's about a dance game it's only just kind of sad that's all so um
yeah Alex terrible sure does all right well is it a world premiere if no one
goes to see it it's a neighborhood premiere it's a street premiere all
right moving on to our phone lines one eight seven seven game olr is the number
to call and I'm opening those up right now making sure we're online and
available I am I'm like out of practice I only miss like two weeks of show and I
forget how to multitask it's kind of sad did you have this many problems when I
was gone to our Sakura no yeah I had a few all right I feel better then all
right we are up and available on Skype one eight seven seven game olr or a
username on Skype of course is orange lounge radio in the meantime we're gonna
get to some of our Twitter topics that you guys send us every week at twitter
com slash olr and the first and only tweet so far comes to us from dark or
dark Tetsuya not our Sakura she's here dark Tetsuya says on the topic of DDR
freak have you heard about this reunion tournament thing they're doing I hope we
can show support for him somehow uh good question I had heard there was supposed
to be an event on 20 November is that even a weekend that this is happening
20 November Thursday so it would have to be like 20 oh no I'm looking at 20
November is a Sunday I'm all for it if they do a meet up on 20 November but no
I haven't heard anything since the original Facebook poll so we need to
look at Facebook and follow up on that I don't know but we'll find out that's a
good question meanwhile let's go to the phones hire on
orange launch radio who's this some Shane what's up Shane I didn't know what
name I was gonna use so I changed it midway so sometimes sometimes we call
you meekly top and now you're Shane Shane nothing I'm just enjoying Final
Fantasy 14 right now did you hear did you hear us talking about that earlier
no because your feed sucks tonight I it's not us I don't know what's going on
we're trying all games I know but I'm still going but all games you know what
they give it to us for free so if they have an off night I can't get to well
you can get AIDS for free to use it Shane now that is a quote it does have a
point you can get yours for free comparing yours with a pretty accurate I
like yet you can probably get like Mexican labors for free you don't want
them either Final Fantasy 14 you can pay 25 bucks for and yet now you say this is
worth it I think you can actually get a little cheaper than that but yeah all
right so fine you can get it on eBay or whatever but now you have come around on
Final Fantasy 14 and you say Final Fantasy 14 is worth it yes it only took
a year of them completely overhauling the game for it to be playable alright
so how is this game gone from bad to good in your opinion well I mean it's
turned into what it looked like from the get-go a Final Fantasy 11 clone and we
played that for years and years and it it's fun I am enjoying my time I like it
because it's got like a real story you get invested in and I keep deleting my
characters and starting them over playing the intro areas because one of
them is like so depressing at the end because this little girl has her father
killed by one of these big ugly I forget what they're called like gob use or
something from Final Fantasy 11 but because 14 had to take everything from
11 and just change the name and that's how they were making it new and
exciting right yep and they updated the graphics so it's pretty like I like
making my character over and over again too because I can't decide on the hair
color what's wrong with blue I thought you did blue everything nope nope they
don't have a good color of blue so I went with brown but there's like eight
different shades of brown so I keep starting and like oh this is good for
five minutes but I need a different brown color so the game is fun huh yes
that means they're gonna start charging for it soon probably not because I
remember reading a quote saying that they would not start charging until the
game was at the point that they wanted it to be at and recently with this new
patch that came out this week they said that they feel the game is only halfway
to that goal of being you know where they would want it to be as a playable
game and that took a year so I'm hoping for another year free not paying for it
every month and if it keeps up like that I'll continue to play and maybe if I get
past level five and they got rid of the physical level so it's only one level
your class level no longer like class for physical six or something stupid
like that so maybe if I get past level five and I'll like it even more and I
want to keep playing it cuz I mean it is technically one of the cheaper MMOs to
play monthly it's only like 12 I guess but that mean what Wow's 15 most are
priced in that area right how much is the Star Wars that memo gonna be do we
know yet 15 they said per month unless you do like the same thing well does
where if you pay for like six months at a time you get like for a dollar cheaper
per month technically right isn't worth it live listeners um our feed went down
but it's back up and that was us when amp crashed I don't know what it's
probably got sick of all the delay stuff that's going on on the other side I
don't know so I know you should just like let everybody call into Skype and
then we could just listen that way party you have a Skype party um but anyway if
we're done talking about that real quick I also wanted to mention that tap sonic
has also been taking over for me really um they updated the free songs and they
added some quote unquote American songs they're actually pretty fun to play like
passion pits on there Gwen Stefani is on there and then some new kpop got added
for free because I don't pay for stuff on that yet because I don't like micro
transactions right and you have to pay like each time you play a song right
yeah extra don't like that's dumb um and also technica threes soundtrack got
leaked and it's all over YouTube and I love it is there anything I'd actually
know huh is there anything I'd actually know in it uh it's got sampling masters
in it they do a song but I guess one of the people from sampling masters has
been the past few games and I didn't know that no but they put it like a lot
of happy hardcore in there like stuff I could see I'm one of the happy to be
hardcore CDs and it's really good and I love it all right well we're gonna
invite keyboard lights up I got a new keyboard and it's changing colors a lot
all right we're gonna let you go so we get some more calls here that's fine I
just won't be able to listen to what you guys say after this well we had the
crash so try again maybe it's better now who knows doubt it fine bye bye so rude
he's so optimistic he really is what an ass let's go to the phones and see if
our next caller is nicer hi you're on orange launch radio who's this hello
hola bienvenidos a orange lounge radio who's this stunned into silence hang up
there's a crank collar I guess they knew their connection wasn't working I don't
know 1 8 7 7 game olr or a username on skype is orange lounge radio and in the
meantime I'll try to go back to Twitter except I closed Firefox like a genius
genius I guess we could have kept Shane on that you know be optimistic about
things a little more I like Shane I like him when he's appropriate no I'm just
kidding I guess isn't appropriateness is part of what makes him
Shane right yep yes and you take your friends as they are or yes murder them
in their sleep I mean you take them as they are all right let's go to our
Twitter topics because I know we have at least a couple more coming in here now
Tigerclaw sent us some tweets take down notice against some Battlestar Galactica
modders this is a tweet a twink a tweet to us from Tigerclaw let's see a
Battlestar Galactica mod for Nexus and I guess this made the attention of NBC
Universal who sent a cease and desist letter to mod DB who'd been hosting the
work on it I don't even wow I don't even know what this is about here but of
course there is already a Battlestar Galactica online game so I'm sure this
is definitely a conflict of interest when you put Battlestar Galactica into
another game well it's also you know if you're doing a mod that's like with
licensed properties and stuff like that I mean that's kind of to be expected if
you know if you're doing your own mod or something like that you know and that's
a little different by the way this game had to remove everything that was
related to Battlestar Galactica so not just the popular one so bummer all right
let's see also hold on why are you calling back I don't know you didn't
have any other callers like I should tell time I just was slow in getting the
Twitter loaded I don't think so no yes I was sounded like because I had the feed
up and running and was the fees working now he was calling yeah if he was back
well then there you go yeah so I called so Battlestar Galactica season to say I
love that I'll start Galactica I know about that but as it has nothing to do
with the story did you even hear the story yes okay what was the story
NVC made them shut down some mod for some game that nobody plays okay good
job you pass pass the test so are you sad that they had to take down the mods
or you just I don't know how if you love Battlestar Galactica so much here's my
real question if you love it so much why aren't you playing the MMO I did for a
day and it was terrible really so I didn't play it anymore why was it
terrible I couldn't control my Cylon ship and I was like this isn't realistic
at all I'd be making out with helo or yeah that's really is awesome that's
absolutely realistic I'm sure in bow star Galactica it would be because he
loves Cylons and I was a Cylon all right all right I'm hanging up on you to get
some other calls you're tying up okay if there are finally people calling by one
eight seven seven game olr or username on skype is orange lounge radio so
meletops gone and we do have another call coming in so let's see
hi you're on orange lounge radio who's this oh it's legend of Zaku hey legend
of Zaku how you doing pretty good been doing stressful at work but you know
been hanging in there I hear usual it's been stressful my work too what's on
your mind buddy just the usual you know grasp of the fact that um even though
Steve Jobs did pass away it's like he his legacy in terms of how how he's
actually laid out a plan that might actually impact the way we view you know
any like portable dedicated gaming systems I'm just saying the fact that
you know his passing is pretty much you know give me a little bit of time to
reflect that mobile gaming might actually you know unless unless Nintendo
gets into the business selling phones well Sony's getting there getting there
as long as they buy out Erickson then they'll be set well but I'm more
concerned about Nintendo and the fact that they just like shrug it off with a
cavalier attitude if Nintendo you know started selling phones and they would
have to acknowledge the fact that there's online and well exactly you know
how that and this is and this is where you know these uh these mobile these
mobile game developers they they target that audience where they're basically
pissing in the same pool that Nintendo is you know spent hard cultivating ever
since the game the days of the Gameboy but the idea is that they're going after
the casuals I know it's a segment of the market that's like it's it's really hard
to break in because these are people who aren't like you know they're just
they're just typical folks they're not like your your average gamer you know
but the idea is that Nintendo it's you know they have such they're just
shrugging it off and they're good they're being so naive about like not
adapting like not realizing that the guys who you know the creators of Angry
Birds at the end of the day they're still gonna make bank while Nintendo is
gonna be scratching their head as to why they're not innovating why they're not
staying ahead of the curve and you can see as the Wii U you resolve the Wii U
is innovative the Wii U it's about you and it's just a Wii with a you know with
the touch remote and suppose it suppose it better graphics even though it's like
it's still being worked out hold on hold on hold on hold on cycle hold that
thought there's something really important I hate to interrupt our Sakura
are you really reading about Final Fantasy 14 over there yeah I was curious
oh dear it doesn't mean I'm gonna play it I was just looking you were
experimenting did I catch you experimenting in the middle of the show
I was just looking all right I had to give you crap all right sorry yeah it's
like you know it's if Nintendo were really you know if they were serious
about like trying to capture the the casuals they would have to like they
they wouldn't just act like they wouldn't have like an arrogant tone and
that's what I'm hearing you know that's what I hear from their bosses like they
they hate the the guy they're hating on the folks who you know on the Angry
Birds folks so the indie devs because at the end of the day who you know they're
gonna be pissed when their lunch gets eaten you know by those guys Steve
Steve Jobs his impact is gonna be felt for a long time and you know you were
mentioning about kind of his style I think a little bit there at the
beginning of the call did you hear that news report about that they're gonna
have executives kind of be taught on his styles well that's the thing you can't
really teach you can't really teach anyone else that type of style you know
you're with that ability to be a perfectionist I can I got it you can't
really teach an artist especially one that's born into it born with that
talent I mean you're sure they can become artists and they grow to realize
that they have the talent within them but you can't just force that person to
be a perfectionist to be as as meticulous as he was I mean you're bad
for that new guy a little the fact that he managed to change the you know my
industry which I actually do work in mobile so I was you know I was you know
the day that the day of the iPhone came out I realized that yeah I was gonna
history was changing you know with that with that very same blow you never
thought that we would go all the way from feature phones to high-end you know
two smartphones that people could buy for the same price as they were paying
for those shitty phones four years ago I gotta say though I I kind of feel bad
for that new guy that came in and stepped in as CEO I mean I know Steve
Jobs hand-picked him and I'm sure he's fine he's been he's probably really been
doing a lot more of the work for the past couple years but if you think about
it okay his first big press conference is about the iPhone 4s which is really
yeah yeah that was shocking I mean it was the fact that they couldn't even
like announce something greater than the iPhone 4 here's the problem I mean it is
what it is if Jobs has still been around that would have been his announcement to
make it I know but but think about this he knew Tim Cook had to know when he was
up on that stage that the former CEO was I mean he knew I'm sure he knew the
Steve Jobs was about to die well we actually well that was already known the
day he stepped down and that was like you know that was months ago I'm talking
the day tomorrow but the idea is that you know he said he paved the way in the
in the fact that he that you know mobile mobile gaming has like explode in the
past four to five years used to be a small niche market that only folks who
had the money to to pay for those shitty you know games for for those devices
back then but now it's like the quality is getting to the point where it might
even rival whatever Sony and Nintendo is actually spitting out I mean if you look
at the fact that these phones are like it's cheaper than the than the Vita
itself that they start cheaper than the Vita and they had just about this you
know just about the same number of games and the fact that the quality is damn
near almost ps2 level first you know for for a device that you know no greater
than four inches yeah that's pretty impressive hey hey hey hey all right all
right Zach we're gonna let you go so we wrap up but um thank you for your call
yeah anytime take care buddy all right I know he was definitely impacted by that
because you know if you listen to show before Zach was called in before and he
does work with mobile gaming and definitely we've seen more intervention
come out of the mobile world from Apple than anywhere really I think and
definitely not from Nokia all right that's gonna do it for calls tonight
sorry to those that didn't get through it but be sure to send us an email for
next week mailbag at orange laundry new calm or you could always send us a tweet
twitter.com slash OLR um I want to quickly quickly read one more tweet here
from Tiger Claw cuz I didn't get to this he sent a story from gamasutra about
this is kind of a longer article but I guess the headline is game developer
conference online web wise kids team for game promoting online child safety so
web wise kids is the game or no as the company then I guess they're just
promoting children being safe online I would assume like not sharing over
sharing personal details and so forth I there is a free title that's saying is
out there it's called passing the ball and it's an action game that follows a
parent and their child as they learn an important lesson about working together
I guess that it would be passing a ball which to me sounds a lot like you jump
to a conclusion somebody will get the reference all right the reference all
right thank you there is a donation link within passing the ball so you can make
a donation to web wise kids and they will be doing something with the game
developers conference event in San Francisco the initiative will include a
one-day gamers for change event created by the same nonprofit team in addition
to commissioning the game for web wide kids and adding the donate link to the
game $1,000 was directly donated to this network to help the programs to promote
a culture of safety responsibility and respect for youth and families in the
digital world again watch your damn kids and make sure if they have a Facebook a
they ought to be at least like 13 or 14 but B if they aren't you're monitoring
it you know exactly what they're doing I have heard a really young permanently
blind them I have well I have heard about really young kids with Facebook
accounts mostly to play the games which is fine as long as the parent is kind of
you know has watching out the corner of their eye you know what they're doing
although I think standing there looking over their shoulder well yes and no I
mean you can't put the child on it I mean at the at the end of the day it's
up to the parent that's fine but I think and sometimes you should sit there and
want to play the game with them but maybe there's times where you you kind
of get it loaded for them and then you can walk away for a couple minutes give
that child a sense of safety whatever make sure that when you walk back that's
what they're still doing you know porn friends wanna porn Ville not porn Ville
forget it all right there you go that's gonna do it for another week here at
Orange Lounge Radio oh but I did miss one little little thing we got to do thank
you Loki for pointing this out I totally missed this earlier what can I say I'm
out of practice so it's time for the FUs of the week
if you to people who don't do their damn part that's it fucking my crappy crappy
crappy very very crappy firewall at work that doesn't allow us to play live very
well because of our strict NAT settings and it's funny our I you know our IT guy
actually opened the NAT ports for my system made it worse so that's great
unfortunately they're gonna be installing a new firewall in a couple
weeks and if that doesn't work he's gonna put our systems outside the
firewall so that hopefully that won't be a problem all right a few to headaches
I've been getting some huge ones today and it's just it's not been good I'm
very sad but I did really wear myself out yesterday so that could be like part
of the reason why so I don't know that's it for that fuse of the week now we can
start to wrap up the show actually I got to ask Loki do you have any email last
minute last minute stories for us no I'm not gonna look anything up fine then
we'll go around and get everybody's final thought Loki will start with you
my final thought is opening our opening on the 12th will be voting for the
podcast awards so don't forget to vote every day every single day tell your
friends tell your enemies just make sure you vote every single day and especially
tell your frenemies yes my final thought is tacos if we win the podcast award we
will celebrate with a taco party that's for sure is that your final thought
tonight dark side yeah that's my final thought fuck shit that's it have a
wonderful night everybody thanks for tuning in and supporting orange launch
radio show always do it hey if you like the show all we ask tell a friend about
the show help spread the word remember guys we don't have advertising dollars
it's part of the reason that we we were hoping we'd get nominated for the
podcast award is because it's great exposure and you know we can't we don't
have a big magazine or a giant website that backs us up so thanks again as
always for your help and helping us spread the word so we'll see you next
week we'll do it all again with another week of orange lounge radio until then
