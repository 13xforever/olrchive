73000	75000	Stop trying to sound so hurt about it
75000	82000	My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining over the next few hours with my sometimes questionable co-host
82000	83000	Hi
83000	85000	Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers
85000	89000	You know, it's almost as if you never left, we had such a derpy
89000	91000	I heard about the derpisodes while I was gone
91000	92000	Yes, we called them derpisodes
92000	97000	I haven't heard, just like the podcast listeners which I apologize for in advance, I haven't heard last week's
97000	101000	But I heard about half of the one from two weeks ago on the commute to work
101000	106000	The one from two weeks ago was like two minutes
106000	108000	Yeah, you guys just flew through the news
108000	111000	And I did like a bajillion hours to pump up the volume
111000	114000	Not tonight though, oh my god we have a huge show tonight
114000	116000	We have like big announcements, big stuff to talk about tonight
116000	121000	Of course I have to introduce the other guy here on the show, say hello to tech master Loki
121000	124000	And I'll have you know for the record, I'm always questionable
124000	126000	What?
126000	128000	I can't wait to hear your last one
128000	130000	Oh you can be questionable, I'll just be questioning
130000	131000	Huh?
131000	132000	What?
132000	133000	Huh?
133000	134000	Why?
134000	135000	Why?
135000	136000	Why?
136000	138000	Okay, so yeah, I've been gone for a couple weeks
138000	142000	And I gotta say, at first I apologize, especially the podcast folks
142000	146000	Because the podcast feed is behind a week right now and that's pretty much my fault
146000	148000	I've been extremely busy
148000	151000	Now I know what you're gonna think though, like yeah, the reason why I miss the shows
151000	153000	I went to a rock concert two weeks ago
153000	157000	Look, it's a band I've missed like three times
157000	160000	And I said I am seeing Lady Tron this time come hell or high water
160000	162000	And it rocked
162000	164000	But they only want you when you're 17
164000	166000	And then last week, when you're 21 you're no fun
166000	169000	Last week I went to Disneyland, I know rough life right
169000	172000	But I came back to just craziness at work
172000	176000	And I had this performance I was doing last night
176000	180000	I participated in a local production of Repo the genetic opera
180000	184000	Yes the movie, they do shadow casting for that now a la Rocky Horror
184000	187000	Which as you guys may or may not know, Rocky Horror is kind of the reason
187000	189000	I got into podcasting in the first place
189000	191000	Because Rocky Horror led to Undersedation Live
191000	193000	The show I used to be on led to this show
193000	197000	So I still support actively the Rocky Horror community
197000	199000	And this show leads to neurosis
199000	201000	I can talk about this now
201000	206000	There actually was a surprise cameo of the song Sweet Transvestite in Repo
206000	208000	So I played Riff Raff on stage but I had to keep it a secret
208000	211000	I wanted to tell people I couldn't because it was all a surprise
211000	214000	And the crowd went wild and it was a great show man
214000	216000	When they did some of the killing scenes
216000	219000	They did that whole thing where the blood sprays out in the audience
219000	221000	Over the first five rows, it was awesome
221000	225000	So big kudos to the folks here in SAC that made that happen
225000	227000	And my friend played Blind Mag
227000	230000	Yes, she was phenomenal
230000	231000	She was really good
231000	234000	Oh my gosh, I loved her, she was as they would say, fierce
234000	236000	I didn't get to go last night, I wanted to
236000	239000	But she has that dramatic quality in life
239000	242000	And I don't want to ruin the movie too much
242000	244000	But it's been out a few years now
244000	247000	She has a pretty dramatic death scene that's very over the top
247000	249000	And just awesome to watch
249000	251000	So, anyhow
251000	254000	Only good role Sarah Silverman has ever done
254000	256000	Wait, you mean Sarah Brightman?
256000	258000	Sarah Brightman, why does it say Silverman?
258000	259000	Sarah Brightman
259000	260000	Keep in mind
260000	262000	Were you thinking of your fellow Jews? Is that what it was?
262000	264000	I guess so
264000	266000	Yom Kippur has taken over your life
266000	269000	But Sarah Brightman, I've made no secret of this
269000	271000	I think she's way too brassy as a soprano
271000	275000	And I know that Christine was for her for Phantom of the Opera
275000	276000	But you know what?
276000	278000	Hate her in it, hate her, hate her, hate her, hate her
278000	282000	But she was really, really good as Blind Mag
282000	284000	Yes, I agree
284000	286000	And to bring this back to games
286000	291000	Repo, even though some people don't really like it as a movie
291000	294000	And say it's a terrible movie, because it is a little weird
294000	296000	It's the guy who did Saw doing a rock opera
296000	299000	And like opera, meaning everything is a song
299000	300000	But Tony Head
300000	302000	Anthony's to her head
302000	303000	Hello
303000	305000	And it's told in that kind of comic book style
305000	307000	And it's just neat, it's something you should see
307000	308000	Anyhow
308000	310000	And they should make a game out of it
310000	312000	Back to video games for a minute
312000	315000	Obviously this has been like everywhere this week
315000	317000	But we have to mention it, we have to
317000	319000	Steve Jobs passed away this week
319000	322000	And it's kind of one of those things, it's insanely sad
322000	324000	I know it's all been all over CNN
324000	326000	And especially all over Twitter and Facebook and so forth
326000	328000	I know you guys have heard a lot about it
328000	331000	But how could we not tip our hat to Steve Jobs
331000	334000	And obviously, he did a lot for podcasting
334000	336000	He didn't invent podcasting
336000	339000	But definitely what happened with iTunes
339000	341000	Propelled it into the stratosphere
341000	344000	And we have a lot to thank for that, for the exposure
344000	347000	And plus, it was called podcasting in the beginning
347000	349000	Even before iTunes, because
349000	351000	And we were actually doing a show back before iTunes
351000	353000	That's how long the show's been going on
353000	357000	Your old RSS would kind of
357000	359000	You could get these programs that would actually
359000	361000	Still sync them to your iPod
361000	363000	Because they weren't iPhones back then, but iPods
363000	365000	And you kind of sync it that way
365000	368000	And so there were ways to do what iTunes was doing before that
368000	371000	But it was always designed with that portable
371000	373000	On the go thing in mind
373000	376000	I think it's important to mention, Steve Jobs contributed a lot
376000	378000	To things that don't even start with an eye
378000	380000	So regardless to how you feel about Apple
380000	382000	Well, okay, I got one Apple thing I gotta say though
382000	386000	Is that him and Woz did the Apple IIe
386000	388000	That was a huge thing
388000	391000	And that was like, hello childhood school
391000	392000	In the garage
392000	394000	Well, the original Apple was in the garage
394000	397000	But yeah, that leads to Apple II
397000	400000	Which is what we all, like anybody who grew up in the 80s
400000	401000	We all did
401000	403000	How many of us played Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego
403000	405000	On one of those rectangular bricks?
405000	407000	Or Oregon Trail
407000	409000	Or Math Blasters
409000	412000	You know, that was a huge part of our education
412000	416000	And I think, you know, to me it was always like
416000	418000	Really looking forward to Computer Lab Day
418000	421000	I'm sure you other nerds feel the same way, right?
421000	422000	It was just like, Computer Lab Day was awesome
422000	424000	We didn't have computers in Alabama
424000	426000	Really? Oh
429000	430000	No, we had like
430000	431000	I actually believed you for a minute
431000	434000	We actually had one Apple IIe in the library
434000	437000	Which I would just go play all the time
437000	439000	And then we had like the tall brick Macs
439000	440000	You know what I mean?
440000	441000	Right
441000	446000	At a couple of the facilities that I used to do volunteer work at
446000	449000	And if it wasn't for him, we wouldn't have the MacBook
449000	452000	And we wouldn't have been able to upload the virus to the alien mothership
452000	454000	To save the world on Independence Day
454000	456000	Absolutely, absolutely
456000	459000	Very important contribution is that Steve Jobs
459000	461000	Did contribute to saving us from virus
461000	463000	Virus, Mac OS, same thing
463000	465000	Even back in the day
465000	470000	The first really good graphics programs were developed on Mac
470000	472000	And that's why, I mean
472000	474000	And Macs were in schools everywhere
474000	476000	Especially when you and I were growing up
476000	478000	And Loki, Macs were everywhere
478000	480000	In our schools
480000	482000	And that was a really smart ploy on Apple's part
482000	484000	But certainly you get attached
484000	486000	I was in yearbook
486000	489000	Which I know is something very similar to what you do now
489000	491000	You might not do yearbook, but you do publishing
491000	493000	And we did that shit on PageMaker on a Mac
493000	495000	It was good times
495000	497000	And now we're like, did you use PageMaker?
497000	499000	InDesign, hello
499000	501000	But yeah, but Adobe
501000	505000	Even fully supported the Mac platform
505000	507000	For ages until they finally realized
507000	509000	Oh yeah, PC's caught up, oops
509000	513000	And there was also the gaming connection too on the 2600
513000	515000	Jobs had played a role in
515000	517000	Breakout on the Atari 2600
517000	519000	That's one of the more kind of, I mean
519000	523000	Woz talked about how he kind of got shafted
523000	525000	On the Atari bonus on that game
525000	527000	But regardless of all that
527000	529000	And how things went down
529000	531000	He did kind of have that more direct impact on the gaming industry
531000	533000	And I gotta say this you guys
533000	535000	This is the one that people forget about
535000	537000	Not everybody, but some people have forgot about
537000	539000	CNN stuff, I think is the most important
539000	541000	In some ways, things that he did
541000	543000	He brought Pixar
543000	545000	Back, and like, Pixar
545000	547000	Is amazing
547000	549000	The movies they make and everything
549000	551000	If you hate every single Pixar movie that's ever been made
551000	555000	I question your taste, I'm sorry to say
555000	557000	But like, you know, and I
557000	559000	Pixar has made some that you may not like
559000	561000	Like I know not everybody dug Cars 2 or Ratatouille
561000	563000	Or A Bug's Life
563000	565000	But seriously, like, Wall-E
565000	567000	Up, Toy Story
567000	569000	1, 2, or 3, take your pick
569000	571000	How often does a movie like that have so many great sequels?
571000	573000	Right?
573000	575000	I do have to say though
575000	577000	Most CG movies today
577000	579000	Are made in Linux-based programs
579000	581000	Well, you know, but
581000	583000	Whether it was Apple PC or what
583000	585000	Jobs bought that company in the 80s
585000	587000	And had that vision of making
587000	589000	An animated movie out of computers
589000	591000	And, you know, a lot of people kind of pass that off
591000	593000	And there's still some today
593000	595000	That kind of feel that, well, traditional animation is best
595000	597000	And, you know, I think
597000	599000	I think we're getting to a place where you get
599000	601000	A good mix of the two, like there's been some great
601000	603000	Traditionally animated ones, like I like Princess and the Frog
603000	605000	An awful lot, but
605000	607000	Boo!
607000	609000	What, you don't like that movie? It was terrible
609000	611000	I haven't seen it. I thought it was great. Hater.
611000	613000	Alright, but then there's some, you know, obviously the stuff
613000	615000	Pixar does, even up through like Tangled
615000	617000	Were really, really good movies, even though I know Tangled
617000	619000	Was not technically Pixar, but
619000	621000	I mean, you look at DreamWorks
621000	623000	Look at any of them, I mean, basically
623000	625000	Pixar really innovated the
625000	627000	The genre
627000	629000	So, um, so yeah
629000	631000	A tip of the hat to a guy
631000	633000	Who, um, was very sassy
633000	635000	Too, like in the way he ran his company
635000	637000	Was very unlike other CEOs
637000	639000	So, a tip of the hat to Steve Jobs
639000	641000	And rest in peace
641000	643000	Sadly, I think we all kind of, I mean
643000	645000	When it happened, it was like, oh wow, but I think we all
645000	647000	Kind of, you know, we all kind of knew
647000	649000	When it happened, I was like
649000	651000	Oh, it finally did, because he had been
651000	653000	Very holistic in his approach
653000	655000	Towards his cancer treatment
655000	657000	And while I'm a big fan
657000	659000	Of holistic treatments
659000	661000	For something like that
661000	663000	I don't condone it
663000	665000	Well, and he had issues
665000	667000	No matter what you believe in
667000	669000	He had issues with his pancreas
669000	671000	And you just, the pancreas is like your heart
671000	673000	If it gets damaged, you can't live without it
673000	675000	And, you know
675000	677000	In some ways, this kind of new strikes
677000	679000	Close to home, because you guys may or may not remember
679000	681000	If you've been listening long enough, back in 2008
681000	683000	I had a pretty serious medical issue that
683000	685000	Took me out of the show for a few weeks, and it was pancreatitis
685000	687000	And it's no joke
687000	689000	And I was very scared there for a minute
689000	691000	When they had to do the MRI on it
691000	693000	Because they told me flat out they had to rule out
693000	695000	Pancreatic cancer, because I had a growth on my pancreas
695000	697000	Thank heavens it was just a cyst
697000	699000	So, you know, I
699000	701000	Absolutely feel, and I know it had to be
701000	703000	A great deal of pain
703000	705000	And now it's been stopped and desisted
705000	707000	Well, in his case, you know
707000	709000	I meant for you. Oh, for me?
709000	711000	Stopped and desisted
711000	713000	Oh, I get it, desisted, har har
713000	715000	But no, at least for him, he's not in pain anymore
715000	717000	Like, he was up on the stage as late as
717000	719000	What, April? He did that?
719000	721000	The Stanford thing too
721000	723000	That was before, but yeah
723000	725000	But April was the whole iCloud thing
725000	727000	And so, you know, he was on stage for that
727000	729000	So when you consider that was six months before
729000	731000	He ultimately passed away
731000	733000	You know, I'm just glad he's not in pain anymore
733000	735000	And I hope his family and all that
735000	737000	Is doing
737000	739000	Okay
739000	741000	Alright, so on to
741000	743000	I'm just gonna turn the car, complete 180
743000	745000	Like really, really sad news to really
745000	747000	Alright, we're going back
747000	749000	Now we're going to Disneyland, everybody
749000	751000	So
751000	753000	We mentioned a couple weeks ago
753000	755000	On the show that we really appreciated
755000	757000	If you guys would nominate us for the podcast award
757000	759000	Which we won back in like 2005
759000	761000	But I don't even think we've been nominated since
761000	763000	Maybe like one time, I don't remember
763000	765000	But it's mostly been, especially in those first
765000	767000	Couple years, 06, 07
767000	769000	A lot of like the corporate cast
769000	771000	And you know, a
771000	773000	nomination in there would go a long way towards
773000	775000	Exposure for the show and everything and
775000	777000	Oh my god, we got nominated, we did
777000	779000	It was announced yesterday, we got nominated
779000	781000	Podcastwords.com if you want to check it out
781000	783000	It's amazing
783000	785000	And what's really amazing, I'm gonna be honest
785000	787000	You know, the other shows that are nominated
787000	789000	Like, I think all but one
789000	791000	Or maybe two of them are indie shows
791000	793000	You're talking like ten shows
793000	795000	And there's some awesome indie shows in there
795000	797000	And so I feel very confident
797000	799000	That some indie is gonna
799000	801000	Walk away with it
801000	803000	And that's great, you know
803000	805000	And indie's gonna be getting the exposure
805000	807000	Although I'd rather be our indie show
807000	809000	Well sure, not gonna lie
809000	811000	It would be awfully nice
811000	813000	No, I want us to be nominated just to lose
813000	815000	It would be awfully nice
815000	817000	But, you know
817000	819000	If you don't vote for us, we'll eat wet cigarette butts
819000	821000	Don't care
821000	823000	We'll throw a protest, no
823000	825000	Obviously we would love a vote
825000	827000	And voting opens on the 12th
827000	829000	Podcastwords.com
829000	831000	It's this interesting thing where you have to vote every day
831000	833000	So please vote often
833000	835000	And yeah
835000	837000	We would really appreciate it
837000	839000	That would be great
839000	841000	But win or lose, we're gonna just keep doing what we always do, right kids?
841000	843000	Yeah, being awesome
843000	845000	I'm gonna quit if we lose
845000	847000	I'm done, stomp
847000	849000	Alright
849000	851000	Let's move on and talk about
851000	853000	We gotta get back to video games
853000	855000	Let's talk about our gaming weeks
855000	857000	And the stuff that we have been playing this week
857000	859000	So DarkStalker, we'll start with you
859000	861000	How was your gaming week?
861000	863000	I really haven't played much of anything
863000	865000	I mean, just because I've been super busy with school
865000	867000	Excuses, excuses
867000	869000	I was on, well, just long enough to do dailies
869000	871000	And that's it, really
871000	873000	I mean, I did like one instance
873000	875000	But like, yesterday
875000	877000	It was Yom Kippur
877000	879000	Oh yeah
879000	881000	Honestly, I have to say that it was
881000	883000	You know, people complain
883000	885000	About fasting
885000	887000	And oh, I'm so tired
887000	889000	But for me, it was actually kind of good to step away from everything
889000	891000	Is Yom Kippur like no technology, either?
891000	893000	Well, on top of that, it was on a Shabbat, regardless
893000	895000	So that means that
895000	897000	Technically, if you're gonna observe it, then yeah, no
897000	899000	Nothing creative
899000	901000	No Facebook, no games, nothing creative
901000	903000	No writing
903000	905000	You read Torah, you read commentaries
905000	907000	Oh, okay, I was like, are you allowed to read on the Kindle?
907000	909000	Only if it's a Torah?
909000	911000	Oh yeah, I guess if I was reading Torah, commentary on the Kindle, I could do that, yeah
911000	913000	But I mean, it's
913000	915000	But for me, it was just sort of like
915000	917000	Stepping away from everything
917000	919000	You know, I turned off my phone
919000	921000	I turned off my computer
921000	923000	You know, I
923000	925000	And yeah, the fasting thing is never fun
925000	927000	But
927000	929000	I spent a lot more time around people
929000	931000	I gotta say
931000	933000	You know, my friends, some of my friends
933000	935000	And I used to do a trip
935000	937000	Sadly, we don't do it anymore
937000	939000	We used to do a trip every year to Mendocino
939000	941000	Off the grid
941000	943000	Because you literally don't have cell service when you're that close to the ocean
943000	945000	And you know, just
945000	947000	It was actually a really neat trip
947000	949000	And it forced me to get away from all that and just be with people
949000	951000	Which was great
951000	953000	So I have to say that actually
953000	955000	It's been a good week of disconnecting
955000	957000	From
957000	959000	The games and the internet
959000	961000	So your gaming week has consisted of
961000	963000	Being anti-technology
963000	965000	It was a vacation
965000	967000	And then I found a game that I totally
967000	969000	Have to have
969000	971000	And that's that Kirby
971000	973000	10 Kirby game
973000	975000	Where it's like Kirby's broken up into 10 parts
975000	977000	And you have to find all of his parts
977000	979000	And then you attack things by throwing a bunch of Kirby's at it
979000	981000	I want that game
981000	983000	Mass attack, that's it, I want that game
983000	985000	Go get it!
985000	987000	I broke
987000	989000	I will fill in for your gaming week then
989000	991000	Since you were on a religious observance
991000	993000	And so forth through the week
993000	995000	What some folks in chat have been playing
995000	997000	YYR in our chatroom says
997000	999000	I bought a Turbo Duo with 11 games
999000	1001000	Not that I have much less played or anything
1001000	1003000	Because this show is rated TG-16
1003000	1005000	Um
1005000	1007000	And Tidalitis
1007000	1009000	Hope I said that right, said my gaming week
1009000	1011000	Street Fighter III Third Strike Online
1011000	1013000	Bought DJ Hero 2 on a whim at Big Lots
1013000	1015000	Well if they were selling it at Big Lots
1015000	1017000	That means it was probably 10 bucks
1017000	1019000	Hence why he probably got it on a whim
1019000	1021000	It's a good whim
1021000	1023000	I think DJ Hero is a pretty underrated series
1023000	1025000	It's unfortunately like
1025000	1027000	The other music games that I played
1027000	1029000	I buy it
1029000	1031000	I get all excited about it, play it a little bit
1031000	1033000	And then it goes away for a while
1033000	1035000	But then eventually once I have
1035000	1037000	Nothing to do
1037000	1039000	I'll go back and play it again
1039000	1041000	It didn't have fabulous longevity
1041000	1043000	And I think the fact that it has such a large controller
1043000	1045000	That you have to kind of like put away
1045000	1047000	Then get out, plug in
1047000	1049000	I think honestly when people want to play
1049000	1051000	Sometimes they just want to turn on the system and go
1051000	1053000	So I don't know
1053000	1055000	But yeah, DJ Hero at least was a great game
1055000	1057000	Alright Loki, how was your gaming week?
1057000	1059000	Uh, it was pretty good
1059000	1061000	I played a few things
1061000	1063000	Grand Theft Auto, barely
1063000	1065000	Because our firewall has been
1065000	1067000	Absolute shit
1067000	1069000	Apparently Microsoft went down
1069000	1071000	Live went down for a little bit
1071000	1073000	On Monday
1073000	1075000	And for some reason after that
1075000	1077000	Our firewall has been just absolute shit
1077000	1079000	We were lucky to get 4 out of the 5
1079000	1081000	Consoles connected to live
1081000	1083000	In a game together
1083000	1085000	And actually be able to stay in
1085000	1087000	It has been more of like
1087000	1089000	Oh, let's see whose console stays online
1089000	1091000	Long enough for us to fish the game
1091000	1093000	And sometimes only two of them
1093000	1095000	So it kind of sucked
1095000	1097000	But it's still
1097000	1099000	Sorry, we played a little bit of that
1099000	1101000	And then played a little bit of Earth Defense Force
1101000	1103000	Just doing some farming for my
1103000	1105000	Jet Trooper guy
1105000	1107000	And then the new game that I played this week
1107000	1111000	Was Dead Rising 2 Off the Record
1111000	1113000	Which I was really excited about that
1113000	1115000	And it's a pretty awesome game
1115000	1121000	The only disappointment I have with the game is
1121000	1123000	Dead Rising 2, one of the things I hated
1123000	1125000	Was the fact that you have to keep going back
1125000	1127000	To give your stupid daughter zombrex
1127000	1129000	I was like, cool!
1129000	1131000	Dead Rising 2 Off the Record is gonna be
1131000	1133000	Dead Rising 2 is gonna be awesome
1133000	1135000	Because you don't have to do that anymore
1135000	1137000	No, this time
1137000	1139000	Frank West is infected
1139000	1141000	And he needs to take zombrex
1141000	1143000	So I was like
1143000	1145000	Aw, come on!
1145000	1147000	Thankfully, when I did that
1147000	1149000	When I got to that point
1149000	1151000	I was like, aw, come on!
1151000	1153000	I switched right over to sandbox mode
1153000	1155000	And there's none of that shit
1155000	1157000	So it's just killing zombies and that's it
1157000	1159000	Funny enough, the way the beginning of that
1159000	1161000	Is this game already out or is it coming out?
1161000	1163000	It's coming out
1163000	1165000	So the way it kind of begins in the sandbox mode
1165000	1167000	He's being dropped out of a helicopter
1167000	1169000	Much like the first game
1169000	1171000	And they're all, so are you covering your next big scoop here?
1171000	1173000	He's all, no, not this time
1173000	1175000	This is my vacation!
1175000	1177000	And doesn't roll onto the roof
1177000	1179000	And then just starts killing zombies
1179000	1181000	But everything transfers back and forth
1181000	1183000	Your experience and costumes
1183000	1185000	And crap that you get
1185000	1187000	So right now I went through a sex shop
1187000	1189000	So I had a bunch of
1189000	1191000	Weird
1191000	1193000	Village people-esque
1193000	1195000	Stuff on
1195000	1197000	You know, when I think of the village people
1197000	1199000	I don't necessarily think of sex
1199000	1201000	Well chaps, okay
1201000	1203000	Maybe it's a generation thing
1203000	1205000	Nah, it's more like leather chaps
1205000	1207000	Alright
1207000	1209000	Just for whatever reason
1209000	1211000	I was just picking up all the clothes on the way
1211000	1213000	Whatever ends up happening, that's fine
1213000	1215000	But now I have this weird mask and bull horns
1215000	1217000	On my head, so
1217000	1219000	Not gonna lie, I always got the biggest kick out of playing a furry
1219000	1221000	And moisturizing and putting on the big furry costume
1221000	1223000	Haven't gotten there yet
1223000	1225000	But it is pretty fun
1225000	1227000	Yes, I'm a furry
1227000	1229000	Virtually
1229000	1231000	But it's nice to be able to do
1231000	1233000	The photography stuff
1233000	1235000	And Frank
1235000	1237000	Even in the main story mission
1237000	1239000	Which I'll probably go back to that
1239000	1241000	It's still pretty funny
1241000	1243000	Because the dialogue
1243000	1245000	And stuff's a little bit different
1245000	1247000	But a lot of the stuff that happens in the game
1247000	1249000	Is similar
1249000	1251000	It'll be interesting to see how the game plays out
1253000	1255000	So I'd recommend picking up
1255000	1257000	Especially since it's not even a full price game
1257000	1259000	It's just 40 bucks
1259000	1261000	Only?
1261000	1263000	It's like Dead Rising 2
1263000	1265000	But better
1265000	1267000	It's priced where most games ought to be in my opinion
1267000	1269000	But anyway
1269000	1271000	Definitely worth picking up
1271000	1273000	That's pretty much all I've played this week
1273000	1275000	Alright
1275000	1277000	Well hey, let's go to my game of the week
1277000	1279000	No I'm sorry
1279000	1281000	One last thing
1281000	1283000	Burnout Crash played that a little bit
1283000	1285000	And that's actually pretty fun
1285000	1287000	Despite the fact that I really hated the idea of a top down burnout
1287000	1289000	But it's actually a pretty fun game
1289000	1291000	Alright, you done?
1291000	1293000	I'm done
1293000	1295000	You sure?
1295000	1297000	So I haven't played a whole lot of games
1297000	1299000	Especially this week
1299000	1301000	I already told you guys I've been busy as hell
1301000	1303000	Besides the Disneyland games
1303000	1305000	I gotta go to Flynn's Arcade because Electronico is back
1305000	1307000	And play some classic games there
1307000	1309000	They didn't mix them up a little bit
1309000	1311000	I noticed some games were gone
1311000	1313000	But I play stuff like Frogger that's always there
1313000	1315000	And I also, you know, of course
1315000	1317000	Midway Mania
1317000	1319000	Which is a lot of fun
1319000	1321000	Came back and I've played, of course, a lot of Warcraft this week
1321000	1323000	As far as other games
1323000	1325000	That are not things I've already talked about on the show before
1325000	1327000	I took an opportunity
1327000	1329000	Since we were just talking about game pricing
1329000	1331000	I took an opportunity to pick up the latest
1331000	1333000	Humble Bundle
1333000	1335000	And if you didn't know
1335000	1337000	There is the Humble Frozen Synapse Bundle
1337000	1339000	Going on right now
1339000	1341000	And that is where you basically pay
1341000	1343000	What you want for the game Frozen Synapse
1343000	1345000	And it comes with
1345000	1347000	The game Spacechem as well
1347000	1349000	And if you're not familiar with Humble Bundle
1349000	1351000	They just had one of these
1351000	1353000	Not even a month or two ago
1353000	1355000	Because I remember that's how I got VVVVV
1355000	1357000	Was in one of these Humble Bundles
1357000	1359000	It's a very interesting
1359000	1361000	New way to price
1361000	1363000	Games
1363000	1365000	Where people can kind of pay what they want
1365000	1367000	And these games are not necessarily
1367000	1369000	New, but
1369000	1371000	They're, you know
1371000	1373000	Good games
1373000	1375000	And I think something a lot of people
1375000	1377000	May not have given another look
1377000	1379000	If they didn't have this whole pay what you want thing going on
1379000	1381000	And I think they're making pretty good money
1381000	1383000	Off of it and a chunk of it goes to charity
1383000	1385000	Which I think is great
1385000	1387000	And it's not just Spacechem either
1387000	1389000	If, well hold on I want to put this out
1389000	1391000	So if you spend more than the average
1391000	1393000	Which right now is $4.75
1393000	1395000	You get some other games as well
1395000	1397000	You get Shadow Grounds
1397000	1399000	You get Shadow Grounds Survivor
1399000	1401000	I think these other games were
1401000	1403000	Only with pre-order
1403000	1405000	I don't think you get them anymore
1405000	1407000	You get the game Trauma now too I think is thrown in there
1407000	1409000	And the one other game I want to mention
1409000	1411000	Because this is the one I played, Trine
1411000	1413000	Was in the bundle as well
1413000	1415000	I think Trine was on Xbox Live Arcade
1415000	1417000	I overlooked it, I never played it
1417000	1419000	So I'm playing it now on PC for the first time
1419000	1421000	Because I paid more than the average so I could check it out
1421000	1423000	It's pretty cool, I like it
1423000	1425000	When I was reading the description of it
1425000	1427000	I didn't quite understand it
1427000	1429000	But now that I'm playing it I'm like oh okay
1429000	1431000	So it's like a puzzle game
1431000	1433000	But you can automatically switch between a warrior type
1433000	1435000	A thief type and a wizard type
1435000	1437000	But when I say a puzzle game
1437000	1439000	I'm talking like a side scroller
1439000	1441000	So it's like Mario-esque I guess you want to say
1441000	1443000	But when you switch to the wizard
1443000	1445000	The warrior can draw blocks or he can levitate blocks
1445000	1447000	The thief has a long range attack
1447000	1449000	And can use a grappling hook
1449000	1451000	The warrior has a short range attack
1451000	1453000	And can use a shield
1453000	1455000	And you literally hit one button to switch between
1455000	1457000	Because the story kind of goes that all three of them
1457000	1459000	Find this magical item
1459000	1461000	That they get attached to
1461000	1463000	Because usually the thief and the warrior
1463000	1465000	Would not be getting along
1465000	1467000	And the mage and the thief would be having this weird
1467000	1469000	Thing going on
1469000	1471000	So the item binds them all together
1471000	1473000	And so now their souls are all shared or whatever
1473000	1475000	So they're going on this adventure to remedy that
1475000	1477000	And find treasure along the way
1477000	1479000	So that's basically the premise of the game
1479000	1481000	So you hit one button to switch between all these different types
1481000	1483000	So I think it's cool
1483000	1485000	And the other thing I love about these Humble Bundles
1485000	1487000	Is that they come with a key
1487000	1489000	So you can play them in Steam
1489000	1491000	So you buy the thing loaded in Steam
1491000	1493000	Now you have all the Steam achievements
1493000	1495000	People know what I'm playing
1495000	1497000	Can compete against me and all that good stuff
1497000	1499000	So
1499000	1501000	For the low low price of whatever
1501000	1503000	It's great
1503000	1505000	But again I would recommend you
1505000	1507000	Not be totally cheap
1507000	1509000	Spend let's just say five bucks at least
1509000	1511000	And get the other games as well
1511000	1513000	And if you're having a good week give them ten
1513000	1515000	It's a good cause
1515000	1517000	Or whatever you think these games are worth
1517000	1519000	So yeah that's at HumbleBundle.com
1519000	1521000	And trying alone was worth it
1521000	1523000	I gotta admit I tried
1523000	1525000	I was gifted a copy of Frozen Synapse
1525000	1527000	About two weeks ago
1527000	1529000	And Steam was having
1529000	1531000	A buy one get one free sale
1531000	1533000	Where people could give the codes to other people
1533000	1535000	And somebody was kind enough to give me their code for Frozen Synapse
1535000	1537000	I gotta admit
1537000	1539000	I didn't get it at all
1539000	1541000	I think I just need to try again
1541000	1543000	Sometimes you have to be in the right mindset
1543000	1545000	Have you guys ever had that?
1545000	1547000	You have to just be in the right mindset to enjoy a game
1547000	1549000	Sometimes you'll sit down and play it once
1549000	1551000	And you're like I don't get it
1551000	1553000	But then you go back a month later and play it again
1553000	1555000	And you're like oh man what was I missing
1555000	1557000	Which is why I don't think I ever reviewed it on the show
1557000	1559000	Cause I knew I wasn't really prepared to talk about it
1559000	1561000	Oh did Dark Soccer just buy the HumbleBundle?
1561000	1563000	Yes it did
1563000	1565000	Alright
1565000	1567000	I think you'll like trying
1567000	1569000	I'm not gonna buy this one because I haven't even played through more than one game
1569000	1571000	Out of the last bundle I bought
1571000	1573000	But didn't you play VVVVV until you beat it?
1573000	1575000	Yes
1575000	1577000	Until I beat it but not 100%
1577000	1579000	Because I still have one more
1579000	1581000	Shiny object to get
1581000	1583000	And I just want to rip my hair out
1583000	1585000	If I'm supposed to get that
1585000	1587000	It's annoying
1587000	1589000	I mean I get it
1589000	1591000	It's supposed to be hard
1591000	1593000	But I don't want to play it anymore
1593000	1595000	Because it's so hard
1595000	1597000	I'm not gonna come back to it
1597000	1599000	Cause I know what happens if I get it
1599000	1601000	It just flips the damn game upside down
1601000	1603000	Spoiler
1603000	1605000	And you play the same thing again
1605000	1607000	No it's still the same fucking game because you flip up and down
1607000	1609000	It's not like Castlevania
1609000	1611000	I get what you're saying
1611000	1613000	But up until you get to that point
1613000	1615000	It's an amazing game and the music is amazing
1615000	1617000	No it's an amazing game I love it
1617000	1619000	It's such a simple concept
1619000	1621000	It's just like
1621000	1623000	I know alright alright
1623000	1625000	But anyway I think
1625000	1627000	You should play Trion on 360
1627000	1629000	Cause I think a lot of people may have already played it
1629000	1631000	I would say that alone makes the set worth it
1631000	1633000	But you know
1633000	1635000	Check it out
1635000	1637000	Frozen Synapse I think is a bit more of a strategy game
1637000	1639000	Also comes with soundtracks in the editor
1639000	1641000	I haven't even picked that up
1641000	1643000	See you know what I just picked up my steam code
1643000	1645000	And went to town
1645000	1647000	Yeah
1647000	1649000	There you go
1649000	1651000	Salacious Pop is reminding me in our chatroom
1651000	1653000	Trion is also gorgeous
1653000	1655000	I'm doing this in the name of Orange Jones Radio
1655000	1657000	Even though I just put 10 bucks
1657000	1659000	Well still
1659000	1661000	Let's see
1661000	1663000	Trion is very gorgeous at least on the PC
1663000	1665000	I haven't seen it on 360 so I can't compare
1665000	1667000	But it is a very good looking game
1667000	1669000	Very cartoony lush lighting effects
1669000	1671000	It is a really good looking game
1671000	1673000	And very smooth on my computer
1673000	1675000	And I'm playing it in like 1680 by 1050
1675000	1677000	Widescreen
1677000	1679000	In high quality so
1679000	1681000	It's great
1681000	1683000	Yeah actually Salacious Pop may not even know
1683000	1685000	I didn't even have the graphics on their highest setting
1685000	1687000	I had it on high not very high
1687000	1689000	So maybe I'll have to try again later with the very high
1689000	1691000	So anyway that's pretty much my gaming week
1691000	1693000	So I think we will move on
1693000	1695000	To gaming news and talk about all that
1695000	1697000	With you guys in our chatroom
1697000	1699000	I guess I can quickly mention once again
1699000	1701000	Please follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash o-l-r
1701000	1703000	We also have a Facebook at facebook.com
1703000	1705000	Slash orange launch radio
1705000	1707000	This is also the part of the show where I will mention
1707000	1709000	Any housekeeping like upcoming shows that we're missing
1709000	1711000	And what have you
1711000	1713000	I'm stuck for the rest of the year
1713000	1715000	I don't see myself missing any shows
1715000	1717000	You know something unforeseen may always come up
1717000	1719000	I'm missing one in a few weeks
1719000	1721000	That's right Dark Soccer you are leaving for a week at the end of the month right?
1721000	1723000	I will be gone on the 23rd
1723000	1725000	So hopefully we'll have a guest host
1725000	1727000	Just like you guys had Dan here when I wasn't here
1727000	1729000	And we'll move on
1729000	1731000	Alright let's get into some gaming news
1731000	1733000	Loki start us off what's up
1733000	1735000	So PlayStation 2 games
1735000	1737000	As we've kind of thought for a while
1737000	1739000	Are going digital
1739000	1741000	In this new only on PlayStation Network campaign
1741000	1743000	They're going to be doing
1743000	1745000	Every Tuesday this month
1745000	1747000	They're going to have a new
1747000	1749000	Exclusive selection of rare
1749000	1751000	Classic games
1751000	1753000	God Hand, Grim Grimoire, Maximo
1753000	1755000	And Odin Sphere
1755000	1757000	And Ring of Red
1757000	1759000	Um
1759000	1761000	And I guess you know of course they
1761000	1763000	They're old PlayStation 2 games
1763000	1765000	They've done nothing to them no updates
1765000	1767000	Or whatsoever they just play now
1767000	1769000	On the PlayStation 3
1769000	1771000	And um
1771000	1773000	I guess um
1773000	1775000	PlayStation Plus members get them at
1775000	1777000	A 20% off discount
1777000	1779000	During the launch week
1779000	1781000	And if you spend more than $60
1781000	1783000	In October you'll get a $10
1783000	1785000	Credit for November
1785000	1787000	So um
1787000	1789000	Interesting
1789000	1791000	I guess they're saying there's also
1791000	1793000	A lineup of PlayStation Network exclusives
1793000	1795000	Now these aren't necessarily
1795000	1797000	These are actually not
1797000	1799000	PlayStation 2 games but
1799000	1801000	Euphoria and
1801000	1803000	Rock Hard that was actually
1803000	1805000	This week on the 4th
1805000	1807000	Next week on the 11th Sideway
1807000	1809000	New York on the 13th
1809000	1811000	Sodium Collection
1811000	1813000	If it's sodium
1813000	1815000	Might as well forget about it
1815000	1817000	18th Okabu
1817000	1819000	And Rocketbirds
1819000	1821000	And then on the 25th the expansion for
1821000	1823000	Infamous 2, Infamous Festival Blood
1823000	1825000	And Pixel Junk
1825000	1827000	Side Scroller
1827000	1829000	But all I gotta say is
1829000	1831000	Yeah thanks Sony you figured out a way
1831000	1833000	To play PlayStation 2 games on your PS
1833000	1835000	On your PS3 systems
1835000	1837000	But you don't do a free update
1837000	1839000	For everybody so they can I don't know take their old games
1839000	1841000	That they have and make everybody happy
1841000	1843000	Because they have backwards compatibility
1843000	1845000	No you decide to sell them on the marketplace
1845000	1847000	Figures
1847000	1849000	I'm trying to give Sony the
1849000	1851000	The
1851000	1853000	Whatever you call it I have a headache
1853000	1855000	Thank you the benefit of the doubt
1855000	1857000	I'm trying to give Sony the benefit of the doubt right now
1857000	1859000	And the whole
1859000	1861000	Backwards compatibility thing and I'm trying to think
1861000	1863000	Ok what is the reason why
1863000	1865000	You couldn't just put a disc into the PlayStation 3
1865000	1867000	It's because they had an entire PlayStation 2
1867000	1869000	In the PlayStation 3 originals
1869000	1871000	Right?
1871000	1873000	That emotion chip or whatever it was called in the PlayStation 2
1873000	1875000	Right?
1875000	1877000	Then eventually they got rid of it
1877000	1879000	Have they emulated that?
1879000	1881000	Well then they got rid of one of the chips
1881000	1883000	Remember that's why the backwards compatibility got cut a little bit
1883000	1885000	But then they also were able to cut the price by a hundred bucks
1885000	1887000	Yes and then they got rid of both chips
1887000	1889000	But now they have
1889000	1891000	Obviously an emulator because this is the way
1891000	1893000	That the PlayStation 1 games work
1893000	1895000	Because it's all emulation
1895000	1897000	So now they have an emulator that works
1897000	1899000	Or some way obviously that's able to do this stuff
1899000	1901000	And
1901000	1903000	They just
1903000	1905000	I know what you're doing
1905000	1907000	Here's my other question
1907000	1909000	Ok the whole benefit of the doubt thing
1909000	1911000	Is it maybe a situation similar to
1911000	1913000	Xbox 360 and original Xbox
1913000	1915000	Or maybe their emulator doesn't emulate
1915000	1917000	Everything and that's why they don't want to open it up
1917000	1919000	Because maybe it can't play the big big games
1919000	1921000	Like I mean you got a lot of neat games
1921000	1923000	In this original launch here
1923000	1925000	But let's be real it's not like you have
1925000	1927000	Your Final Fantasy X
1927000	1929000	Your Grand Theft Auto Vice City
1929000	1931000	Well yeah they're doing
1931000	1933000	Just rare
1933000	1935000	Classic games right now like God Hand
1935000	1937000	Like real niche stuff
1937000	1939000	That nobody maybe bought the first time
1939000	1941000	These I can guarantee aren't
1941000	1943000	All in the same engine
1943000	1945000	That's kind of how the Xbox backwards compatibility
1945000	1947000	Worked is they were trying to get
1947000	1949000	Everything to work correctly and you'd see
1949000	1951000	Like a big lot of games that were
1951000	1953000	All you know part of the same
1953000	1955000	You know engine game engine
1955000	1957000	They were running on that's why all these games
1957000	1959000	All of a sudden became available
1959000	1961000	That's why you got the Barbie Horse Adventures and you know some other
1961000	1963000	Good games
1963000	1965000	It
1965000	1967000	It's because they lost
1967000	1969000	It's because they lost a lot of money
1969000	1971000	When the Playstation Network went down
1971000	1973000	And they need to recoup that
1973000	1975000	That's why they're selling them
1975000	1977000	I did notice
1977000	1979000	That there was very little fanfare about this
1979000	1981000	You know what I mean like we've been building
1981000	1983000	Up to this for a long time remember about two years ago
1983000	1985000	There were the whole rumors about the Dreamcast
1985000	1987000	Things were going to be coming and
1987000	1989000	I don't know but those already have
1989000	1991000	No but there was something else about like
1991000	1993000	Around that same time like Playstation 2
1993000	1995000	Games were supposed to be opened up
1995000	1997000	Like there was a whole thing in that memo or whatever
1997000	1999000	Like I just seem to remember hearing that something with
1999000	2001000	Sega and it kind of never came to fruition
2001000	2003000	But we've been like waiting a long time
2003000	2005000	And thought there would be a big announcement
2005000	2007000	Like I thought there would be something at E3
2007000	2009000	Or even Tokyo Game Show about this
2009000	2011000	But no this just was like no yeah we're gonna
2011000	2013000	Just put these up in the marketplace enjoy
2013000	2015000	Well that's why you're seeing a lot of these older games that are
2015000	2017000	Very niche and stuff because these companies aren't gonna
2017000	2019000	Necessarily put out like these HD
2019000	2021000	Remakes or whatever of their old games
2021000	2023000	So like obviously you're not gonna
2023000	2025000	Find a Grand Theft Auto or something like that
2025000	2027000	Is part of this because
2027000	2029000	You know as we discussed last week of course
2029000	2031000	They're going to at some point up res all the
2031000	2033000	Grand Theft Auto games and put it out on a disc
2033000	2035000	I mean it's just
2035000	2037000	Stupid that if they don't I mean
2037000	2039000	Why wouldn't you especially if you know San Andreas
2039000	2041000	It would be easy all you would have to do
2041000	2043000	Is re-license the music in there
2043000	2045000	Obviously that would be a cost
2045000	2047000	And maybe re-record you wouldn't even
2047000	2049000	Necessarily have to re-record the
2049000	2051000	Audio in the game
2051000	2053000	Obviously you'd have to get the rights from all the
2053000	2055000	Voice actors and stuff like that but
2055000	2057000	You know if you put it in the
2057000	2059000	Rage Engine or something like that and they've already
2059000	2061000	Done that on the PC modders have already taken care of that
2061000	2063000	It could be done
2063000	2065000	And it's just getting all the
2065000	2067000	Rights and all the legal stuff taken
2067000	2069000	Care of but once they do that I mean
2069000	2071000	It's just gonna be amazing
2071000	2073000	Going to our chatroom for some comments at chat.orangelauncherady.com
2073000	2075000	SSJ100Matt
2075000	2077000	Says it's tactics like this that make
2077000	2079000	People want to hack their PlayStation 3
2079000	2081000	YYR says maybe
2081000	2083000	They're just doing software emulation
2083000	2085000	Wasn't there a PlayStation 3 model that did that already
2085000	2087000	Although it didn't support every game?
2087000	2089000	I remember that too wasn't it the Europe one?
2089000	2091000	Or maybe they had one here too but wasn't there
2091000	2093000	One overseas?
2093000	2095000	The old 80 gig systems that came
2095000	2097000	Out here a long time ago
2097000	2099000	80 and the 40
2099000	2101000	I think it was the 80 gig systems like the
2101000	2103000	Melger Solid one it was one of the first ones that
2103000	2105000	Supported just some of
2105000	2107000	The titles and not all of them
2107000	2109000	You mean like the one sitting in my front room?
2109000	2111000	Maybe. And then the 40 gig
2111000	2113000	Systems stopped supporting it and eventually
2113000	2115000	The 80 gig systems also stopped supporting it
2115000	2117000	But yeah it is
2117000	2119000	Software emulation so
2119000	2121000	Is the PlayStation 1 games
2121000	2123000	And in fact the PlayStation 1
2123000	2125000	Games you can take that
2125000	2127000	Emulator and basically dump any ISO
2127000	2129000	Into it and it'll work just fine
2129000	2131000	That's what they've done on hacked PSPs
2131000	2133000	Is they've taken that same emulator and you
2133000	2135000	Can run any PlayStation 1 game
2135000	2137000	And I'm guessing this is probably the same
2137000	2139000	Situation with the PlayStation 2 stuff
2139000	2141000	Is it's just an emulator that they have
2141000	2143000	And they've found a way to just
2143000	2145000	Basically they can dump any ISO in there
2145000	2147000	And done. They're ready to go
2147000	2149000	I don't know cause I haven't really seen anybody
2149000	2151000	Try to hack it apart yet but
2151000	2153000	I'm guessing that's probably what it is
2153000	2155000	Do you think they'll make a lot of money off this Loki?
2155000	2157000	Um yeah cause especially the games
2157000	2159000	That they're putting up like Odin Sphere you know
2159000	2161000	That's a game that was out there for just a
2161000	2163000	Little bit and it's a pretty awesome game
2163000	2165000	And a lot of people probably missed it and same with
2165000	2167000	God Hand. God Hand was another one that was just
2167000	2169000	You know clover game that's just
2169000	2171000	Amazing
2171000	2173000	Yeah I gotta admit there's some of those that I kinda
2173000	2175000	Want to check out too but thankfully
2175000	2177000	Alan has like a couple of these
2177000	2179000	Already so it's just like oh we just
2179000	2181000	Gotta hook up the PlayStation 2
2181000	2183000	It's sad though that they aren't even
2183000	2185000	Trying to like
2185000	2187000	Update these at all I mean they're not even
2187000	2189000	Smoothing out the graphics
2189000	2191000	Or whatever that you would get I think you can
2191000	2193000	Do that with the PlayStation 3
2193000	2195000	Well shit I haven't even tried to run
2195000	2197000	A PlayStation 2 game on my 20
2197000	2199000	Gig well 500 gig now
2199000	2201000	But um
2201000	2203000	I know you can do the smoothing stuff
2203000	2205000	Like kind of how you were able to with the
2205000	2207000	PlayStation 2 on PlayStation 1 games
2207000	2209000	You know it was a little bit better
2209000	2211000	Um
2211000	2213000	But yeah I mean it's just
2213000	2215000	It's kinda sad
2215000	2217000	That they're selling them and now I understand
2217000	2219000	Yeah I need to make money but
2219000	2221000	I think it would make a lot of people happy
2221000	2223000	If they you know brought that out there
2223000	2225000	So people can do that and then you can
2225000	2227000	Sell the games as well cause not everybody has
2227000	2229000	Got hand or Odin Sphere
2229000	2231000	And hell you can't
2231000	2233000	Buy new copies of that anymore so
2233000	2235000	That might be a good way to
2235000	2237000	You know drive sales and same with the PlayStation 1 games
2237000	2239000	PS3's are fully
2239000	2241000	Backwards compatible with PlayStation 1 games
2241000	2243000	And I'm pretty sure they sell a lot of PlayStation 1
2243000	2245000	Games on their network so
2245000	2247000	I don't understand why they don't do it
2247000	2249000	Um if I may rewind just a little bit
2249000	2251000	Sure of course
2251000	2253000	The game's plot that was a
2253000	2255000	Pre-order one
2255000	2257000	Um are including it when it's available
2257000	2259000	Oh okay
2259000	2261000	Nice
2261000	2263000	Woohoo
2263000	2265000	Good to know
2265000	2267000	Alright well let's move on with some other news
2267000	2269000	This is also about Sony and a comment
2269000	2271000	That they have made this week and it's about
2271000	2273000	The Vita which a lot of people are looking forward to
2273000	2275000	And I gotta say I'm one of them
2275000	2277000	I'm definitely picking up a Vita at launch
2277000	2279000	Loki you're getting one of these too right?
2279000	2281000	Maybe
2281000	2283000	What are you sitting on the fence with right now
2283000	2285000	That has more financial
2285000	2287000	Stuff it's financial
2287000	2289000	Is it? Okay
2289000	2291000	Well it is a financial investment I guess no matter how you look at it
2291000	2293000	I mean I guess it's financial for me too
2293000	2295000	But I just I have a real tendency to spend a lot of money
2295000	2297000	On stupid crap
2297000	2299000	The lineup is looking nice it's just
2299000	2301000	We'll see what they have at launch I mean
2301000	2303000	Alright well let's talk about a comment
2303000	2305000	That Jon Culler this week who's the director
2305000	2307000	Of hardware marketing mentioned in an interview with
2307000	2309000	Investor Palace
2309000	2311000	Quote we firmly believe that PlayStation Vita
2311000	2313000	Will supersede the mobile market when launched
2313000	2315000	And have grand ambitions for a product
2315000	2317000	That is really at the forefront of innovation
2317000	2319000	The mobile market in the US
2319000	2321000	Offers consumers extremely light gaming
2321000	2323000	Options
2323000	2325000	So in other words
2325000	2327000	They seem to think that
2327000	2329000	Despite the fact that the iPhone
2329000	2331000	Is out there with their mobile gaming and all that
2331000	2333000	That the Vita
2333000	2335000	Can kind of give mobile gaming
2335000	2337000	A run for its money
2337000	2339000	Even though it's not a phone
2339000	2341000	Yeah
2341000	2343000	Um
2343000	2345000	I don't know about that
2345000	2347000	I do like the fact that
2347000	2349000	They're opening up to developers
2349000	2351000	And the fact that it has controllers
2351000	2353000	I mean buttons
2353000	2355000	It's important and it's definitely
2355000	2357000	Something that's sorely missed on a lot of these
2357000	2359000	You know iPhone games and stuff and
2359000	2361000	The fact that it's gonna have
2361000	2363000	Still the touch sensor you could
2363000	2365000	Pretty much if you're a developer you could port this
2365000	2367000	Stuff over to the PlayStation
2367000	2369000	Or whatever
2369000	2371000	And you know if it does
2371000	2373000	End up turning out to be pretty viable
2373000	2375000	You could see a lot of stuff coming out of there
2375000	2377000	And yeah they could quickly catch up
2377000	2379000	Beating out Apple right away
2379000	2381000	I don't know about that
2381000	2383000	I mean cause they're not gonna sell more units
2383000	2385000	Than there are iPhones or iPods or whatever
2385000	2387000	iPads
2387000	2389000	Just like their two tablets I mean come on
2389000	2391000	Yeah those things are terrible looking
2391000	2393000	I mean come on
2393000	2395000	No
2395000	2397000	I
2397000	2399000	Well you know I'm still looking forward to the Vita
2399000	2401000	And I think the intricacy of the games
2401000	2403000	On here are not gonna be able to
2403000	2405000	I mean I will be
2405000	2407000	A step higher certainly than what you get
2407000	2409000	On the iPhone and so forth despite everything
2409000	2411000	That you know iPhone showed this week
2411000	2413000	But
2413000	2415000	I think the other big thing that sets this apart
2415000	2417000	Is just the fact that it's designed as a gaming system
2417000	2419000	First so therefore you have things like
2419000	2421000	I don't know tangible buttons
2421000	2423000	And sort of the features that gamers
2423000	2425000	Would want but of course
2425000	2427000	This whole comment like this you know
2427000	2429000	We're better than
2429000	2431000	The mobile games and so forth I think it just serves
2431000	2433000	As justification for them to charge way more money
2433000	2435000	For the games and how much weren't you saying the games
2435000	2437000	Were like 50 bucks on this thing right now
2437000	2439000	Yeah that's what the PSP games are
2439000	2441000	I just I couldn't I always thought
2441000	2443000	PSP games are
2443000	2445000	$40 now
2445000	2447000	But they're they used to be 50 bucks
2447000	2449000	I mean it's just now
2449000	2451000	You're not seeing a lot of games sold on there
2451000	2453000	But yeah there's still $50 games on the PSP
2453000	2455000	And I think that's a great price point
2455000	2457000	I mean assuming that stays there
2457000	2459000	And doesn't go any higher cause
2459000	2461000	I don't know I just
2461000	2463000	Don't think they should be but I like the fact though
2463000	2465000	That the system is gonna be very much like the original
2465000	2467000	PSP where it's a gaming system
2467000	2469000	But it does a lot of other shit
2469000	2471000	Right right and I think
2471000	2473000	That will be probably ultimately its greatest
2473000	2475000	Strength as well is that it's a great college
2475000	2477000	Kids system and I think that's
2477000	2479000	Probably where the PSP sold a lot too
2479000	2481000	So there you go
2481000	2483000	Alright well DarkSakura what do you got for us?
2483000	2485000	I have some stuff and it's more
2485000	2487000	Sony yay
2487000	2489000	Basically they've implied that
2489000	2491000	All the first party titles are going to use the online pass
2491000	2493000	Basically they're
2493000	2495000	Pulling an EA like the $10
2495000	2497000	Deal so they're
2497000	2499000	Saying that Uncharted 3 is gonna use
2499000	2501000	The online pass system
2501000	2503000	That was introduced earlier with Resistance 3
2503000	2505000	And saying that
2505000	2507000	Online pass will be incorporated into future Sony
2507000	2509000	Computer Entertainment Worldwide Studios
2509000	2511000	Games with online functionality
2511000	2513000	Let me say they're gonna
2513000	2515000	Announce more on it later
2515000	2517000	Well now a first party is on board I think it's time to
2517000	2519000	Just accept that this is now the norm
2519000	2521000	Yeah right? Pretty much
2521000	2523000	There's still some people that are
2523000	2525000	I think you'll see a lot more third parties do it
2525000	2527000	You're not gonna see Microsoft do it
2527000	2529000	They can't I mean that would just look good
2529000	2531000	Microsoft can't do it you're right I agree with you there
2531000	2533000	Unless they stop charging for gold
2533000	2535000	Which they're not gonna do
2535000	2537000	So it would be very interesting
2537000	2539000	If they try though
2539000	2541000	I can't wait for that episode
2541000	2543000	And Nintendo well you know
2543000	2545000	They don't even know online exists
2545000	2547000	What online? Exactly
2547000	2549000	That was funny you made a story
2549000	2551000	It's like you have to charge for an online pass
2551000	2553000	What? There's online? There's online?
2553000	2555000	So we can maintain our online system
2555000	2557000	What?
2557000	2559000	What online?
2559000	2561000	Well who knows?
2561000	2563000	There's still a lot of question marks
2563000	2565000	Like what does it do?
2565000	2567000	Well one of those huge question marks is
2567000	2569000	How's it gonna handle online?
2569000	2571000	And they have been purposefully quiet on it
2571000	2573000	Because they don't fucking know
2573000	2575000	They better know by June
2575000	2577000	Like crap
2577000	2579000	We have to do online as well
2579000	2581000	Our online system will be significant
2581000	2583000	Significantly bad
2583000	2585000	I told you at E3 right
2585000	2587000	When they brought the EA guy out on stage
2587000	2589000	I thought he was gonna come out to announce
2589000	2591000	The EA guy
2591000	2593000	That EA was gonna just do the online part of the Wii
2593000	2595000	Like I seriously thought
2595000	2597000	Cause they were talking about a partnership and stuff
2597000	2599000	And they mentioned like online games and stuff
2599000	2601000	And I thought oh they're just gonna let EA
2601000	2603000	Handle the online part of the Wii
2603000	2605000	That'll be what it is
2605000	2607000	No that wasn't what it is
2607000	2609000	That would be terrible if they did that
2609000	2611000	And that would be sad
2611000	2613000	Alright moving on Loki
2613000	2615000	So
2615000	2617000	It's kinda cool during the same time as
2617000	2619000	The Apple
2619000	2621000	And Vail of their new
2621000	2623000	Technology devices and stuff like that
2623000	2625000	There was this whole
2625000	2627000	Kind of like Flash
2627000	2629000	Adobe conference
2629000	2631000	Adobe Max conference going on
2631000	2633000	And some of the new things
2633000	2635000	That they're showing first off
2635000	2637000	Unreal Engine support for Flash 11
2637000	2639000	Which is kind of interesting
2639000	2641000	You're gonna actually have some really decent looking games now
2641000	2643000	Running in the Flash
2643000	2645000	Or even in your own
2645000	2647000	Web browser so
2647000	2649000	That's kinda cool
2649000	2651000	People are saying hey maybe
2651000	2653000	This could be a major transition in social gaming
2653000	2655000	No it won't
2655000	2657000	I'm afraid that's not gonna be the case
2657000	2659000	Cause you know what
2659000	2661000	Yes the technology may be out there
2661000	2663000	To do that
2663000	2665000	But doesn't necessarily mean that a company
2665000	2667000	Is going to do that seeing as they can develop a game
2667000	2669000	Much cheaper that doesn't necessarily
2669000	2671000	Need the Unreal 3 engine
2671000	2673000	But it's neat to see that
2673000	2675000	Hey someday we may be playing
2675000	2677000	Unreal Tournament
2677000	2679000	In our web browser
2679000	2681000	And then
2681000	2683000	Of course not to be outdone by that
2683000	2685000	Crytek also is
2685000	2687000	Investigating Flash for the
2687000	2689000	Cry engine and possibly
2689000	2691000	Doing some sort of cross platform
2691000	2693000	Solution including
2693000	2695000	Support with
2695000	2697000	A bunch of other
2697000	2699000	Systems. They're even saying maybe
2699000	2701000	Looking into iOS and Android that'd be kinda cool
2701000	2703000	I don't know if that'd be able to
2703000	2705000	Obviously not some of the phones
2705000	2707000	Out there like mine but
2707000	2709000	Very cool
2709000	2711000	And of course they're saying
2711000	2713000	Crytek Seal is hard
2713000	2715000	To work at. The first person shooter
2715000	2717000	Warface which is supposed to be coming out in
2717000	2719000	Asian regions
2719000	2721000	But
2721000	2723000	It might be pretty cool if they do some
2723000	2725000	Sort of easy
2725000	2727000	Cross platform solution you may see a lot of these
2727000	2729000	PC games being ported to
2729000	2731000	Many other devices other than just
2731000	2733000	Xbox 360 and PS3
2733000	2735000	In the near future
2735000	2737000	So
2737000	2739000	That's cool and it'll be interesting to see
2739000	2741000	If web browsers actually get
2741000	2743000	Enough technology where
2743000	2745000	They can support really good looking
2745000	2747000	Games that would be kind of interesting
2747000	2749000	Because then you wouldn't necessarily need
2749000	2751000	You know like
2751000	2753000	A tablet device or game
2753000	2755000	Console or whatever you just
2755000	2757000	Play the game. Well web based
2757000	2759000	Game also makes me think about
2759000	2761000	Facebook games and Google Plus
2761000	2763000	Games of which I wish more stuff was
2763000	2765000	There on Google Plus but whatever
2765000	2767000	You know and whether you love or hate
2767000	2769000	Facebook games you gotta think
2769000	2771000	If this technology is gonna be available
2771000	2773000	Soon like could you imagine if
2773000	2775000	Unreal was a Facebook game?
2775000	2777000	I don't know if that would be
2777000	2779000	I see the problem is
2779000	2781000	I just shot my friend DarkSakura
2781000	2783000	In the face! Click here
2783000	2785000	To post to your wall and try Unreal
2785000	2787000	Games now. The problem with that though is
2787000	2789000	I just don't see them
2789000	2791000	Doing like a casual game
2791000	2793000	Like that because once again you know Facebook
2793000	2795000	Kind of tends to
2795000	2797000	Skew towards casual gamers
2797000	2799000	And I don't really see
2799000	2801000	Unreal Tournament you know
2801000	2803000	Appealing to my mom or something
2803000	2805000	Unreal Engine shows up in really weird
2805000	2807000	Stuff. Yes that's true. Like you wouldn't expect
2807000	2809000	A game I completely neglected to mention
2809000	2811000	In my game week probably because I
2811000	2813000	Played it like three weeks ago
2813000	2815000	When I was on hiatus from the show
2815000	2817000	Was the Mortal Kombat collection
2817000	2819000	The classic Mortal Kombats
2819000	2821000	I downloaded that on Playstation Network
2821000	2823000	And played that a little bit
2823000	2825000	And I was surprised to see the powered by
2825000	2827000	Unreal technology logo at the beginning
2827000	2829000	I realized the new game is
2829000	2831000	But I was like well what the hell about the classic
2831000	2833000	Emulation needs the fucking Unreal
2833000	2835000	Engine? Like really?
2835000	2837000	The only thing I could possibly think of
2837000	2839000	Are the little like rotating
2839000	2841000	Images of the arcade cabinets
2841000	2843000	I'm like what?
2843000	2845000	Or maybe there's some maybe I just
2845000	2847000	Haven't seen it yet maybe there's like an unlockable demo
2847000	2849000	For the new one or something that shows up
2849000	2851000	But I was kind of surprised to see that
2851000	2853000	I was like okay I know
2853000	2855000	Mortal Kombat 3 and 2 and 1
2855000	2857000	Did not run on the Unreal Engine
2857000	2859000	No I'm pretty sure they did not
2859000	2861000	This is funny to me
2861000	2863000	So
2863000	2865000	Although if they somehow you know
2865000	2867000	Enabled it to where they took the old
2867000	2869000	MoCap stuff and made it into actual
2869000	2871000	3D models with the
2871000	2873000	MoCap license
2873000	2875000	You know likenesses and stuff
2875000	2877000	It would be very interesting to see something like that
2877000	2879000	It's like oh hey look it's classic Mortal Kombat
2879000	2881000	But we can turn it in any direction
2881000	2883000	And it's 3D
2883000	2885000	Some might pay for that
2885000	2887000	Tigerclaw in our chatroom at chat.orangetontrader.com says
2887000	2889000	An Unreal web based game is possible
2889000	2891000	Look at Quake Live for example
2891000	2893000	Well there's a good example Quake Live is a good time
2893000	2895000	So
2895000	2897000	I'd like to see more stuff like that
2897000	2899000	Certainly it would be very interesting
2899000	2901000	It would also be interesting to see what MMOs
2901000	2903000	That's another big thing that web browsers are used for
2903000	2905000	Some of those free MMOs
2905000	2907000	Although the quality of some of those is
2907000	2909000	Questionable
2909000	2911000	This could take a lot of that to the next level
2911000	2913000	It would be interesting to see what happens
2913000	2915000	Dear Square Enix
2915000	2917000	Final Fantasy XIV
2917000	2919000	Do Square Enix already uses Unreal Engine
2919000	2921000	For some of their projects?
2921000	2923000	Well I know they used it for one game that no one ever bought
2923000	2925000	It was Infinite Undiscovery right?
2925000	2927000	Haven't they used it on Unreal Engine?
2927000	2929000	Infinite Undiscovery was the other one that came out around the same time
2929000	2931000	Yes that no one bought
2931000	2933000	I can't remember the name of it
2933000	2935000	Last Remnant
2935000	2937000	No one bought it
2937000	2939000	No I remember that because I think Alan bought it
2939000	2941000	Or he had it
2941000	2943000	Or played it or something
2943000	2945000	I thought there was another
2945000	2947000	Final Fantasy XIII uses Unreal
2947000	2949000	Oh really?
2949000	2951000	I think it does
2951000	2953000	Hmm
2953000	2955000	You know what I miss?
2955000	2957000	That was pretty cool
2957000	2959000	What? What are you talking about?
2959000	2961000	Do you remember the Square Enix game The Bouncer?
2961000	2963000	I remember that game
2963000	2965000	I remember a brawler called Ergeist
2965000	2967000	But I don't remember
2967000	2969000	Oh Ergeist was awesome
2969000	2971000	That's a game you need a sequel for right there
2971000	2973000	The Bouncer was an early PS2 title
2973000	2975000	Yeah it was actually pretty awesome
2975000	2977000	Were they all Final Fantasy X characters?
2977000	2979000	Except they worked in a bar?
2979000	2981000	As bouncers
2981000	2983000	As bouncers
2983000	2985000	It was a weird game
2985000	2987000	It was awesome
2987000	2989000	Alright
2989000	2991000	I tried to look at the Wikipedia article for Final Fantasy XIII
2991000	2993000	When I need to do research quickly
2993000	2995000	There's always Wikipedia
2995000	2997000	Where people have done the research for me
2997000	2999000	I tried to do a search on Unreal and didn't find it
2999000	3001000	But I thought I saw that logo in the beginning of the game
3001000	3003000	Or heard something about it
3003000	3005000	Speaking of Final Fantasy
3005000	3007000	It's not on our show roll tonight
3007000	3009000	Since I brought up XIII it just triggered it for me
3009000	3011000	Did you guys see the full trailer for XIII Versus?
3011000	3013000	At the web this week?
3013000	3015000	It looks hot
3015000	3017000	It looks very hot
3017000	3019000	It's Final Fantasy, but I have no idea why it's XIII
3019000	3021000	I know it's set in the same universe
3021000	3023000	But I didn't see any of the characters
3023000	3025000	Not really, I thought it was supposed to set more of a real
3025000	3027000	I don't know what the hell it has to do with XIII
3027000	3029000	But whatever
3029000	3031000	There will probably be some obscure little thing when you actually play the game
3031000	3033000	But the action, the battles
3033000	3035000	Kind of look like Kingdom Hearts
3035000	3037000	With the hit points showing up on the screen
3037000	3039000	It looks sweet actually
3039000	3041000	We're going to do an awesome radio moment here
3041000	3043000	And I'm going to pull up the trailer here in studio
3043000	3045000	And I'll post this in chat so you guys can see this too
3045000	3047000	For those of you that are on the podcast feed
3047000	3049000	I'll have DarkSakura posted to our Tumblr
3049000	3051000	At orangeloungeradio.tumblr.com
3057000	3059000	Are you not an IRC DarkSakura?
3059000	3061000	I am an IRC
3061000	3063000	I meant like privately so I can copy the URL
3063000	3065000	Oh yeah I will
3065000	3067000	As soon as I pull it up here
3067000	3069000	I remember, is this it? No this isn't the right one
3069000	3071000	Where did I see that trailer?
3073000	3075000	Somebody in chat will probably
3075000	3077000	Hello Tigerclaw
3077000	3079000	Right?
3079000	3081000	Tigerclaw should have posted it by now
3081000	3083000	Gameplay trailer
3083000	3085000	Maybe it's
3085000	3087000	No that's Eidos, that's Deus Ex
3087000	3089000	Who the hell posted this
3089000	3091000	And I watched it the other day
3091000	3093000	I think somebody had posted it on Facebook
3093000	3095000	Oh so in other news
3095000	3097000	No kidding
3097000	3099000	I have made Fantastic Nut Bread
3099000	3101000	It was quite delicious
3101000	3103000	It has no flour
3103000	3105000	I made it with no flour
3105000	3107000	It's made with almond meal
3107000	3109000	You're not trying to find anything on the new Facebook by the way
3109000	3111000	Your mission
3111000	3113000	If you choose to accept it
3113000	3115000	Find something on Facebook
3115000	3117000	There's a plugin for Chrome that makes it run like the old version
3117000	3119000	Yes
3119000	3121000	The problem is I don't want to use Chrome
3121000	3123000	But yeah
3123000	3125000	Oh yeah that's right
3125000	3127000	They did have the last remnant on PC
3127000	3129000	Anyway
3129000	3131000	Well Rob's looking that up
3131000	3133000	I found one
3133000	3135000	But it's not the right one
3135000	3137000	They did a flip of it
3137000	3139000	I'm trying to see if I can find the
3139000	3141000	Holy crap
3141000	3143000	I'm trying to see if I can find the actual gameplay parts
3147000	3149000	Oh wait
3149000	3151000	This was uploaded in like 2009
3151000	3153000	This isn't even right
3153000	3155000	Gosh darn it
3155000	3157000	Tigerclaw find it for us
3157000	3159000	I will keep looking for it
3159000	3161000	Sorry guys
3161000	3163000	Terrible radio
3163000	3165000	But I know I saw it
3165000	3167000	Shoot the next story is mine
3167000	3169000	I can't look for it while I talk about this story
3169000	3171000	So I'll get through this quickly
3171000	3173000	Although maybe not because this is actually pretty big news
3173000	3175000	Microsoft has talked a little bit this week
3175000	3177000	About some of the TV updates
3177000	3179000	For the Xbox 360
3179000	3181000	We knew after E3 that they were going to be doing this
3181000	3183000	They were going to be bringing more television to the 360
3183000	3185000	But we didn't really know how
3185000	3187000	Well it turns out
3187000	3189000	They've announced some partnerships
3189000	3191000	And some of those include HBO
3191000	3193000	And HBO Go, Comcast, Syfy
3193000	3195000	And Verizon
3195000	3197000	I guess there was an earlier list that had leaked
3197000	3199000	And it turns out a lot of that seems to be correct
3199000	3201000	They did publish a full list of the
3201000	3203000	Partners that will be in the fall dashboard update
3203000	3205000	Comcast went so far
3205000	3207000	As to make a blog post talking about
3207000	3209000	Using the partnership with Microsoft to
3209000	3211000	Offer Xfinity content
3211000	3213000	So it sounds like, and this is
3213000	3215000	Of direct relevance to me because
3215000	3217000	I have Comcast at home living where I live
3217000	3219000	It sounds like
3219000	3221000	That you will be able to
3221000	3223000	Use the on demand system
3223000	3225000	In Comcast, you can use that
3225000	3227000	In
3227000	3229000	The 360 now
3229000	3231000	But see that's the thing
3231000	3233000	I was hoping it would be more original stuff
3233000	3235000	And not necessarily just everything that's on
3235000	3237000	Demand, because if I want to watch on demand
3237000	3239000	I can hit one
3239000	3241000	Button on my remote and I get on demand
3241000	3243000	Content, I don't need to necessarily
3243000	3245000	You know, unless
3245000	3247000	Unless you're able to like say
3247000	3249000	Take your console to
3249000	3251000	Friends house or something like that and then you can
3251000	3253000	Access all your on demand content
3253000	3255000	That way
3255000	3257000	I don't know, I was just hoping for more
3257000	3259000	Original stuff, like an alternative
3259000	3261000	That me having to have cable
3261000	3263000	You know what I mean?
3263000	3265000	Bajillion alternatives out there anyway
3265000	3267000	So I mean
3267000	3269000	This is just adding to the pile
3269000	3271000	So
3271000	3273000	What I'm also curious of is that if
3273000	3275000	They're announcing all these other partnerships
3275000	3277000	The weird thing is though, doesn't HBO want to
3277000	3279000	Charge you 10 bucks for their service and then
3279000	3281000	These other, well HBO I don't think you can
3281000	3283000	Access unless you have HBO, it's kind of like
3283000	3285000	How Xfinity
3285000	3287000	And stuff, you can't access HBO
3287000	3289000	On demand stuff unless you have HBO
3289000	3291000	And isn't it the same with like
3291000	3293000	A mobile app, like you can't access
3293000	3295000	Mobile CNN video unless you have like
3295000	3297000	Comcast or something? Yeah, see so
3297000	3299000	That's why I was just kind of like
3299000	3301000	Eh, don't really care, I mean cause
3301000	3303000	Well, I gotta say though, I do like
3303000	3305000	The idea that you know, because the HBO
3305000	3307000	Stuff isn't on Netflix and it's not really on
3307000	3309000	Demand either, I like that it'll kind of be
3309000	3311000	All in one place, like I get what you're
3311000	3313000	Saying with the one button on the remote, but
3313000	3315000	You know, if the Xbox 360 is gonna be this
3315000	3317000	All in one entertainment device, it'd be nice
3317000	3319000	If you can DVR stuff, that'd be pretty awesome
3319000	3321000	If you don't want to pay for DVR
3321000	3323000	I don't think that's gonna
3323000	3325000	Happen, but you know
3325000	3327000	Also, it looks like
3327000	3329000	AT&T U-verse is gonna
3329000	3331000	Require Xbox Live Gold
3331000	3333000	Starting in November, that was a note
3333000	3335000	That was sent by the AT&T folks
3335000	3337000	To their customers, which I'm assuming
3337000	3339000	Is lining it up with everything else here, right?
3339000	3341000	The TV service will actually require Xbox Live Gold
3341000	3343000	All of them
3343000	3345000	But before
3345000	3347000	Their boxes or whatever
3347000	3349000	Through AT&T U-verse, because some of them
3349000	3351000	Still already have that
3351000	3353000	You know, they do not require
3353000	3355000	Gold
3355000	3357000	But they will now come November
3357000	3359000	That might make some people a little bit upset
3361000	3363000	But not AT&T customers, though
3363000	3365000	Nope
3365000	3367000	Because they're giving them a $60 credit
3367000	3369000	Right, so yes, they give
3369000	3371000	A $60 credit
3371000	3373000	To existing AT&T U-verse customers
3373000	3375000	For Xbox 360 customers
3375000	3377000	Now is that each year or just one year?
3377000	3379000	I think it's just one time, probably
3379000	3381000	That would make sense
3381000	3383000	I want Comcast to give me a $60 credit
3383000	3385000	Alright, so
3385000	3387000	Who found this? Loki found this
3387000	3389000	Did you find this with somebody's help in chat?
3389000	3391000	Nope, I searched Final Fantasy 13
3391000	3393000	Versus sort by date
3393000	3395000	Alright, well good job
3395000	3397000	Here's what the gameplay looks like in the game
3397000	3399000	So you can kind of see
3399000	3401000	There's some live action
3401000	3403000	Things that happen
3403000	3405000	The final round still kind of looks
3405000	3407000	13-ish, but there's a lot of life
3407000	3409000	So here's some battle
3409000	3411000	What's he doing in New York?
3413000	3415000	Right, it's kind of Kingdom Hearts-ish
3415000	3417000	But with that very
3417000	3419000	Final Fantasy 7
3419000	3421000	Or 7 slash 13
3421000	3423000	Environment, you know what I mean
3423000	3425000	The swirly bits look like 12
3425000	3427000	Yeah, I can see that
3427000	3429000	I can see a little bit of 12 here, too
3429000	3431000	But I like this, too
3431000	3433000	Did you notice those little pictures in the corner
3433000	3435000	That the people are actually
3435000	3437000	Live rendering what the people are doing
3437000	3439000	That's pretty cool
3439000	3441000	Here, watch your safety
3441000	3443000	It's cool, yeah, it's awesome
3443000	3445000	It's not just a static picture, it's what they're doing
3445000	3447000	That's like that add-on I use in WoW
3449000	3451000	It's like X-Pearl
3451000	3453000	Yeah, it's X-Pearl
3453000	3455000	Final Fantasy X-Pearl
3455000	3457000	So there you go, there's what your Final Fantasy looks like
3457000	3459000	Is that Cloud?
3459000	3461000	It's Cloud with a gun
3461000	3463000	Send me that and I'll put it on our
3463000	3465000	Tumble bubble blubber
3465000	3467000	There it is for the chatters
3467000	3469000	Because I know us watching trailers isn't always the best radio
3469000	3471000	But there you go, now you have a place you can go look it up
3471000	3473000	If you haven't already seen it
3473000	3475000	So, I guess let's move on
3475000	3477000	With some other gaming news
3477000	3479000	Dark Sakura
3479000	3481000	Complete with an ad by Queen Latifah
3481000	3483000	Sorry, Dark Sakura, I've got to distract you from the trailer
3483000	3485000	Well, how about some Skyward Sword characters
3485000	3487000	There's actually
3487000	3489000	A few spoilers
3489000	3491000	And you'll hear it here first
3491000	3493000	So there is
3493000	3495000	Link and Zelda
3495000	3497000	Are childhood friends
3497000	3499000	And have a special bond
3499000	3501000	There is a bully
3501000	3503000	At Link's school named Groose
3503000	3505000	G-R-O-O-S-E
3505000	3507000	And there is
3507000	3509000	A person named Fe
3509000	3511000	Who is the spirit
3511000	3513000	Don't worry, Link, it gets better
3513000	3515000	Spirit of the Goddess Sword
3515000	3517000	And there is
3517000	3519000	Gaepora
3519000	3521000	Who is
3521000	3523000	Zelda's father
3523000	3525000	And the headmaster of Link's school
3525000	3527000	So
3527000	3529000	There is another place in the game called
3529000	3531000	Faron Woods
3531000	3533000	And you start off the game in a place called
3533000	3535000	Skyloft
3535000	3537000	And you can go to Skyview Temple
3537000	3539000	Where Zelda was kidnapped and is being held
3539000	3541000	Again, yay
3541000	3543000	As far as attacks
3543000	3545000	That are in there, there's holding down the A button
3545000	3547000	Makes Link run faster and gives him acrobatic
3547000	3549000	Abilities, he can run up
3549000	3551000	Walls
3551000	3553000	I guess like he's Spider-Man or some shit
3553000	3555000	Or the fucking
3555000	3557000	Prince of Persia
3557000	3559000	He can grab onto cliffs
3559000	3561000	But that uses Link's stamina
3561000	3563000	But you can replenish his stamina over time
3563000	3565000	There's a spin attack that gives you stamina
3565000	3567000	And when your stamina is depleted
3567000	3569000	You go slowly
3569000	3571000	You become old man Link
3571000	3573000	And that's all I'm going to talk about it
3573000	3575000	Although
3575000	3577000	There is one interesting thing that's in there
3577000	3579000	You can douse
3579000	3581000	You know what dousing is right?
3581000	3583000	You know the old thing where people would have
3583000	3585000	The forked stick and look for water
3585000	3587000	That's dousing
3587000	3589000	I thought there was another name for that
3589000	3591000	A diving rod?
3591000	3593000	Divining rod
3593000	3595000	Because I've known
3595000	3597000	Hippy people that do like
3597000	3599000	Dowsing on your aura and stuff
3599000	3601000	I know hippies
3601000	3603000	Rama in our chat room says
3603000	3605000	Link in high school, what is this? Saved by the Triforce?
3605000	3607000	But anyway
3607000	3609000	Tiffany Amber Thiessen will be playing
3609000	3611000	The part of Zelda
3611000	3613000	But for dousing basically you hold out
3613000	3615000	The sword and point it in the direction of the target
3615000	3617000	And it will flash
3617000	3619000	So basically it's to lead you in the right direction
3619000	3621000	It's kind of
3621000	3623000	Hmm
3623000	3625000	Shadow Colossus did it first
3625000	3627000	So
3627000	3629000	Bunny did it back in the
3629000	3631000	40's
3631000	3633000	Simpsons did it
3633000	3635000	I'm done
3635000	3637000	Well just for
3637000	3639000	Rama
3639000	3641000	Since Rama brought it up
3641000	3643000	I was going to play this for you
3643000	3645000	This was Dark Sakura's reaction
3645000	3647000	To actually hearing about the Zelda game
3647000	3649000	Yes I can
3649000	3651000	I'm so excited
3651000	3653000	I'm so excited
3653000	3655000	I'm so
3655000	3657000	Scared
3661000	3663000	You know I never watched that show for a reason
3667000	3669000	That was the infamous
3669000	3671000	Caffeine Pills episode
3671000	3673000	I understand
3673000	3675000	But I never
3675000	3677000	Watched that show because I can't watch a show with people
3677000	3679000	Acting stupid
3679000	3681000	Seriously that's why I don't watch Seinfeld
3681000	3683000	But yet you went with us to watch Showgirls
3683000	3685000	Because that's different
3685000	3687000	They weren't being stupid to be funny
3687000	3689000	It was funny without trying to be funny
3689000	3691000	Let's travel around the world
3691000	3693000	And check out what's going to be coming to a game store
3693000	3695000	Near you
3695000	3697000	Saved by the bell collection on blu-ray maybe?
3697000	3699000	I don't know
3699000	3701000	That's not a game
3701000	3703000	Thank god
3703000	3705000	That'd be terrible
3705000	3707000	Anything saved by the bell in the game would be terrible
3707000	3709000	Unless you had to murder all of them
3709000	3711000	In which case that could be cool
3711000	3713000	So this week actually some pretty cool stuff
3713000	3715000	As I mentioned on Playstation 3
3715000	3717000	And Xbox 360
3717000	3719000	We're getting the
3719000	3721000	Re-release

3739000	3741000	Power Up Heroes
3741000	3743000	That is kind of
3743000	3745000	A superhero
3745000	3747000	Kinect game that's coming out
3747000	3749000	Red Dead Redemption Game of the Year edition

3815000	3817000	Talking some of the tracks coming out

3851000	3853000	Lots of games
3853000	3855000	Jonah Luma Rugby Challenge on 360
3855000	3857000	Yet another rugby game exclusive to
3857000	3859000	GameStop for some reason
3859000	3861000	And uh
3861000	3863000	1001 Touch Games on
3863000	3865000	Nintendo DS, Might and Magic Heroes
3865000	3867000	Why on earth would you make your game exclusive to GameStop?
3867000	3869000	Rugby games
3869000	3871000	They did that, yeah
3871000	3873000	It's weird. The last rugby game that came out
3873000	3875000	People like rugby? I understand that but
3875000	3877000	People don't like GameStop and I don't want to go
3877000	3879000	There to get my rugby game
3879000	3881000	I mean, let's be real. I'm not gonna buy it
3881000	3883000	505 did it with their last rugby game that came out
3883000	3885000	At the beginning of September and they made it
3885000	3887000	Yeah, nobody has explained to me
3887000	3889000	What the fucking connection between GameStop and
3889000	3891000	Rugby is
3891000	3893000	I have no clue. No idea

3911000	3913000	And for the new listeners
3913000	3915000	Why do you want this game to fail?
3915000	3917000	It's because it's a pain in the ass
3917000	3919000	It's Activision's adventure into
3919000	3921000	Toys and games
3921000	3923000	And if you think download content is bad
3923000	3925000	And you think oh Activision they're gonna
3925000	3927000	Whore out download content
3927000	3929000	You ain't seeing shit with
3929000	3931000	Skylanders
3931000	3933000	My god, they have 30 different
3933000	3935000	Toys you can buy
3935000	3937000	Little figurines, and I hardly even call them toys
3937000	3939000	They do not move whatsoever
3939000	3941000	They're statues, they're basically
3941000	3943000	Download content, they cost $8 each
3943000	3945000	Cause they're trying to get kids
3945000	3947000	To buy the shit
3947000	3949000	And you know how twisted this is?
3949000	3951000	They got in bed with Toys R Us
3951000	3953000	So that they can get on their top
3953000	3955000	Hot 15 games
3955000	3957000	Or Hot 15 toys list
3957000	3959000	Which they did, and they have an exclusive pack
3959000	3961000	Over at Toys R Us, a 3 pack of their figures
3961000	3963000	Yeah, cause that hot
3963000	3965000	Hot games list, yeah that's not manipulated
3965000	3967000	At all to get people to buy shit
3967000	3969000	Right
3969000	3971000	So, hope it tanks
3971000	3973000	So don't follow the hot games list
3973000	3975000	Yes, don't follow it, and it's not
3975000	3977000	It's rigged, it's not Spyro
3977000	3979000	Spyro, it's not what it used to be
3979000	3981000	Shenanigans, it's just like us getting nominated
3981000	3983000	For a podcast award, shenanigans
3985000	3987000	It's just, it's really not worth it
3987000	3989000	I mean seriously, it's $70
3989000	3991000	To buy this game, on a 3DS
3991000	3993000	By the way, it's $70 for the 3DS
3993000	3995000	Wow, oh my god
3995000	3997000	And $70 on every other platform except PC
3997000	3999000	Which is $60
3999000	4001000	Do you really want to spend $70 for a happy square game?
4001000	4003000	Will the little toys do my laundry?
4003000	4005000	Nope, they do nothing, they do not move at all
4007000	4009000	Alright, I'm just saying
4009000	4011000	This will be the next
4011000	4013000	Tony Hawk ride game
4013000	4015000	I mean, it's
4017000	4019000	I will be surprised if this takes off
4019000	4021000	Alright, we'll see what happens
4021000	4023000	If that's it for your releases, then let's go to Japan
4023000	4025000	And check out what's coming out in Japan
4025000	4027000	On the Xbox 360 this week in Japan
4027000	4029000	Dead Rising 2 off the record
4029000	4031000	Forza Motorsport 4 gets its release in Japan
4031000	4033000	As well as Ace Combat, Assault Horizon
4033000	4035000	Call of Juarez, the Cartel
4035000	4037000	Halo Reach gets a price reduction
4037000	4039000	In the Platinum Collection in Japan this week
4039000	4041000	And Connectimals gets a release
4041000	4043000	Is this the one that has bears in it?
4043000	4045000	Plus bears, yeah
4045000	4047000	It's Connectimals
4047000	4049000	Yes, that's right
4049000	4051000	Connectimals and bears
4051000	4053000	By the way, when I was at Disneyland
4053000	4055000	I went in the Innovations building
4055000	4057000	They have a lot of Kinect stuff there
4057000	4059000	In the Innovations building
4059000	4061000	You can play like Child of Eden and stuff
4061000	4063000	But they have a little room, and I thought this was neat
4063000	4065000	They had a little room set up for kids
4065000	4067000	And they were actually people working for Disney
4067000	4069000	Helping these kids play Connectimals
4069000	4071000	And they had it on a giant TV
4071000	4073000	I'm talking like the size of the wall in this house
4073000	4075000	They had a giant TV playing Connectimals
4075000	4077000	My friend Victoria played it for a little bit
4077000	4079000	It was kind of fun
4079000	4081000	It's nice to see some love in the Innovations building
4081000	4083000	I thought it was closed
4083000	4085000	I think it kind of closes
4085000	4087000	It's been remodeled since the last time
4087000	4089000	I was there, and you don't
4089000	4091000	Enter the same way you used to
4091000	4093000	There's no little show when you go in
4093000	4095000	They figured that was kind of dry
4095000	4097000	Well, we made it a point
4097000	4099000	We said we each need to do something we've never
4099000	4101000	Done at Disneyland before, and my friend Victoria
4101000	4103000	Had never been to the Innovations building
4103000	4105000	So we went in
4105000	4107000	And believe it or not, there's some neat stuff in there
4107000	4109000	They still have some Microsoft Surfaces
4109000	4111000	Remember those? The tables?
4111000	4113000	Those were fun
4113000	4115000	So what did you not do before Disneyland?
4115000	4117000	What did I not do before that we did?
4117000	4119000	I don't remember
4119000	4121000	Did you go on the boat?
4121000	4123000	I think there was a ride we went on
4123000	4125000	That I just hadn't been on before
4125000	4127000	For whatever reason
4127000	4129000	I can't remember off the top of my head
4129000	4131000	Did you sneak onto the PeopleMover?
4131000	4133000	We went to the Carnation Plaza grounds
4133000	4135000	And we ate lunch there
4135000	4137000	I don't think that was the official thing
4137000	4139000	But we did eat our lunch there
4139000	4141000	Because that's going away because they're making the new
4141000	4143000	Tangled area there
4143000	4145000	And the Fantasyland expansion
4145000	4147000	We just sat and ate and enjoyed it
4147000	4149000	For the last time
4149000	4151000	I liked where we ate last time
4151000	4153000	In New Orleans Square
4153000	4155000	That was great
4155000	4157000	Carnation Plaza Gardens
4157000	4159000	It's been there since the 50s
4159000	4161000	And it's where they used to do some live shows
4161000	4163000	And events but now it's like
4163000	4165000	Hardly anybody's there and it's right smack in the middle
4165000	4167000	That's another little restaurant that's at the end of Main Street isn't it?
4167000	4169000	There's no restaurant there anymore
4169000	4171000	I mean but it was a restaurant at the end of Main Street
4171000	4173000	That's across from where the buffet is
4173000	4175000	On the opposite side
4175000	4177000	Yes it is
4177000	4179000	So you can name something in Disneyland and I can pretty much figure out where it is
4179000	4181000	Alright
4181000	4183000	Moving on to
4183000	4185000	I want to make sure
4185000	4187000	I caught everything on the 360
4187000	4189000	Let me go on to the
4189000	4191000	PlayStation 3
4191000	4193000	Which this week will get
4193000	4195000	Ace Combat, Assault Horizon, Dead Rising 2
4195000	4197000	Off the record
4197000	4199000	As well as Call of Juarez, the Cartel
4199000	4201000	And Medal of Honor gets a price reduction going into the Best Hits series
4201000	4203000	And that is again PlayStation 3
4203000	4205000	In Japan
4205000	4207000	Trying to quickly look and see if there's anything
4207000	4209000	On 3DS this week
4209000	4211000	Or
4211000	4213000	The Wii even
4213000	4215000	Let's see the 3DS
4215000	4217000	Nope not this week
4217000	4219000	There's a game called Izito 3D
4219000	4221000	That's it
4221000	4223000	But the Misty Pink 3DS has come out next week
4223000	4225000	And I know Loki already has his preordered
4225000	4227000	On the Wii though Just Dance Wii
4227000	4229000	Gets a Japanese release this week
4229000	4231000	I guess that's notable
4231000	4233000	Especially for music game fans
4233000	4235000	I don't know if the song list has been localized or what have you
4235000	4237000	You know I was going to mention something real quick
4237000	4239000	Cause I noticed this last night when I was checking
4239000	4241000	Dead Rising 2 had any download content
4241000	4243000	Just Dance 3
4243000	4245000	What they have is they have it where you can download trials
4245000	4247000	So you can check out the songs before you buy them
4247000	4249000	I think that's a great idea
4249000	4251000	And I know they do that with Rock Band
4251000	4253000	But some other music games do not
4253000	4255000	So yeah
4255000	4257000	Just Dance on the Wii makes its way to Japan this week
4257000	4259000	And that's it for Japanese releases
4259000	4261000	How about
4261000	4263000	Overseas Dark Soccer the other way
4263000	4265000	Well in Europe we have
4265000	4267000	Well I just said the UK we have
4267000	4269000	Dragon's Age 2 Mark of the Assassin
4269000	4271000	Coming out on the 11th
4271000	4273000	Just Dance 3 on the 11th
4273000	4275000	On the 12th Guardian Heroes for Xbox 360
4275000	4277000	Which is awesome
4277000	4279000	Orcs Must Die which is the best name ever
4279000	4281000	And then on the 14th we have
4281000	4283000	Ace Combat Assault Horizon Dead Rising 2
4283000	4285000	Off the record
4285000	4287000	Forza Motorsport 4
4287000	4289000	Might and Magic Heroes 6
4289000	4291000	PES 2012
4291000	4293000	Renegade Ops
4293000	4295000	Sesame Street Once Upon a Monster
4295000	4297000	Spiderman Edge of Time
4297000	4299000	And World Rally Championship 2
4299000	4301000	Bleh
4301000	4303000	Alright
4303000	4305000	Well let's move on
4305000	4307000	With a couple more news stories
4307000	4309000	And then we'll let Dark Sakura have at the classic
4309000	4311000	Game of the Week
4311000	4313000	By the way I just gotta say
4313000	4315000	Part B tonight's gonna be action packed
4315000	4317000	Usually all the good stuff's in Part A
4317000	4319000	But there's like some awesome stuff coming for Part B
4319000	4321000	So I'm just saying for those of you that sometimes
4321000	4323000	Want to tune out halfway through
4323000	4325000	You wanna stick around tonight
4325000	4327000	So I'll tell you why in just a minute
4327000	4329000	So they announced some cool
4329000	4331000	Stuff this week during the
4331000	4333000	Apple press conference
4333000	4335000	Of course the new thing being the iPhone 4S
4335000	4337000	Sorry not iPhone 5
4337000	4339000	But you know what? It's just a name
4339000	4341000	It's seriously just a name
4341000	4343000	Everyone's like, man I'm so bummed they didn't announce
4343000	4345000	The iPhone 5, it's a fucking new
4345000	4347000	iPhone, who cares if they call it
4347000	4349000	iPhone 5, iPhone
4349000	4351000	Fart, it's still a goddamn iPhone
4351000	4353000	I'd buy an iPhone fart
4353000	4355000	Plus the thing that gets me
4355000	4357000	Is that, well there was the 3G
4357000	4359000	And the 3GS and people
4359000	4361000	Didn't get their panties and a bunch about that
4361000	4363000	And quite frankly I'm kinda
4363000	4365000	Glad they're not putting out the iPhone 5 now
4365000	4367000	Because I'm still under contract on the 4
4367000	4369000	I'm not upgrade eligible until January
4369000	4371000	So if there was like that awesome
4371000	4373000	Of a phone coming I would be kind of upset
4373000	4375000	I get to upgrade next month
4375000	4377000	Do you? Yeah. So you can get a 4S
4377000	4379000	Yeah. Alright do you think you'll get one?
4379000	4381000	Yeah. Okay. Oh the dance continue
4381000	4383000	Are you getting excited about Siri?
4383000	4385000	Siri. Explain to me the meaning of life
4385000	4387000	I really don't give a shit about Siri but I'll try it
4387000	4389000	Yeah. So I mean
4389000	4391000	You can try it now. I've read about
4391000	4393000	The Siri pranking on the internet
4393000	4395000	Like some good phrases that people have thought
4395000	4397000	Up to yell at like
4397000	4399000	When your friend activates Siri like things
4399000	4401000	That you would yell
4401000	4403000	Siri text my mom that I'm gay
4403000	4405000	Send
4405000	4407000	You know just prank things to uh
4407000	4409000	Send. That's gonna be a
4409000	4411000	Brand new era of damn you
4411000	4413000	Autocorrect. Yes. Yes.
4413000	4415000	It will be. Oh my gosh. Damn you Siri.
4415000	4417000	Michelle. Michelle are you listening? Michelle you better
4417000	4419000	Get that thing registered right now
4419000	4421000	Damn you Siri. Damn you Siri
4421000	4423000	Dot com
4423000	4425000	Alright
4425000	4427000	Um
4427000	4429000	So anyways iPhone 4S is
4429000	4431000	Coming October 14th
4431000	4433000	It adds a brand new processor the A5
4433000	4435000	Processor which is apparently
4435000	4437000	Dual core. Up to seven
4437000	4439000	Times the graphics capability
4439000	4441000	And uh enhanced
4441000	4443000	You know camera
4443000	4445000	More RAM
4445000	4447000	All sorts of new features
4447000	4449000	Siri of course as you mentioned
4449000	4451000	Um
4451000	4453000	You know new antenna design
4453000	4455000	GCM or GSM
4455000	4457000	And CDMA radios in the device
4457000	4459000	It's gonna be
4459000	4461000	Available in three different
4461000	4463000	Flavors if you will. 16 gigabyte
4463000	4465000	32 gigabyte and 64 gigabyte
4465000	4467000	Ranging from 199
4467000	4469000	And of course
4469000	4471000	In white or black
4471000	4473000	And of course they're dropping the iPhone 4 down
4473000	4475000	To $99 for the 8
4475000	4477000	Gig model and the 3GS
4477000	4479000	Will apparently be free
4479000	4481000	If you know you have
4481000	4483000	With a plan obviously
4483000	4485000	And that would be the 8 gigabyte model
4485000	4487000	As well
4487000	4489000	Some other fun stuff
4489000	4491000	Of course iOS 5 is coming October 12th
4491000	4493000	And with that they're gonna be bringing
4493000	4495000	iCloud and Airplay
4495000	4497000	To gaming
4497000	4499000	So you'll be able to
4499000	4501000	Play with multiple devices streaming to TVs
4501000	4503000	In fact one of the first games
4503000	4505000	To support that Real Racing 2
4505000	4507000	Will allow you to stream I believe
4507000	4509000	Up to four devices to your TV
4509000	4511000	And do split screen gaming
4511000	4513000	With you know it being on your iPhone
4513000	4515000	I had no idea that this was a feature
4515000	4517000	In it. Did they even talk about this at the press conference?
4517000	4519000	Uh I think they did
4519000	4521000	I slept through it
4521000	4523000	Well I was reading live blogs too
4523000	4525000	Kinda just on my break look
4525000	4527000	And it was like you know showing
4527000	4529000	Was it you can run
4529000	4531000	It of course on your iPhone 4s
4531000	4533000	Or on your iPad 2
4533000	4535000	And stream wirelessly
4535000	4537000	Because before they had it where you can link it up to your TV
4537000	4539000	But you have to hook up an HDMI cable
4539000	4541000	And stuff so
4541000	4543000	And of course along with that you know since the
4543000	4545000	Phone can
4545000	4547000	Have a little bit more horsepower
4547000	4549000	Infinity Blade 2 is coming to
4549000	4551000	And since Apple is the king
4551000	4553000	Of handheld gaming as so they claim
4553000	4555000	This week which is
4555000	4557000	You know the way they spin the numbers
4557000	4559000	Is interesting and I don't doubt it at all
4559000	4561000	But it's uh it's
4561000	4563000	It's interesting
4563000	4565000	Infinity Blade 2 becoming the iOS
4565000	4567000	December 1st of course
4567000	4569000	Is gonna look extra pretty on the 4s
4569000	4571000	But it will be I believe compatible with
4571000	4573000	Other devices as well
4575000	4577000	Of course why would you shut out your other
4577000	4579000	Exactly
4579000	4581000	So yeah very
4581000	4583000	Interesting though
4583000	4585000	Well I want to go back to Siri for a minute
4585000	4587000	Because I forgot about this little commercial I had seen
4587000	4589000	On Facebook and so far that was floating
4589000	4591000	Around the internet and then Tiger Cloud just linked it in
4591000	4593000	Chat and this does have to do with
4593000	4595000	Gaming a little bit this is a commercial
4595000	4597000	For the new Siri feature
4597000	4599000	On the iPhone 4s take a listen
4599000	4605000	Read me the message
4605000	4607000	New message from Kay bad news
4607000	4609000	Combustible lemons failed
4609000	4611000	And you meet us at 10
4611000	4613000	Reply definitely I'll see you there
4613000	4615000	Play my running mix
4615000	4617000	Oh joy
4617000	4619000	What's the traffic like around here
4619000	4621000	The traffic will be slow and meaningless
4621000	4623000	Just like your sad little life
4623000	4625000	Text my wife I'm gonna be 30 minutes late
4625000	4627000	She won't mind she doesn't really love you anyway
4627000	4629000	Is it going to be chilly in San Francisco this weekend?
4629000	4631000	Not too cold
4631000	4633000	Your few extra pounds should be suitable insulation
4633000	4635000	To keep you warm
4635000	4637000	What about Napa Valley
4637000	4639000	I hear it's beautiful there
4639000	4641000	Unlike you
4641000	4643000	How many cups are in 12 ounces
4643000	4645000	Let me think
4645000	4647000	Do you really need to make those extra cupcakes
4647000	4649000	Set my timer for 30 minutes
4649000	4651000	Okay 30 minutes and counting
4651000	4657000	Until I end your sad attempt at a life
4657000	4661000	New notification from Sandy Chen
4661000	4663000	Are we still on for dinner tonight
4663000	4665000	Perhaps you should have a snack instead
4665000	4667000	You're looking a little heavy
4667000	4669000	Reply sure I'll be there
4669000	4671000	Here's your reply to Sandy Chen
4671000	4673000	Sure I will be there
4673000	4675000	Me and my extra 20 pounds
4675000	4677000	Stand
4677000	4679000	Well tell me what I say
4707000	4709000	Interesting because I remember when Apple announced FaceTime
4709000	4711000	It was a huge thing that they used
4711000	4713000	They used deaf people in the commercial
4713000	4715000	And it really did make you think
4715000	4717000	Wow that's a big advance for deaf folks
4717000	4719000	But this one the Siri thing uses blind people
4719000	4721000	To be sending the text messages
4721000	4723000	Which is very very interesting
4723000	4725000	I think it's very neat
4727000	4729000	You wouldn't know it from that parody commercial
4729000	4731000	Because all the jokes are about weight
4731000	4733000	But I just thought that was neat
4733000	4735000	Definitely gets you thinking about some of these advances in technology
4735000	4737000	Anyhow
4737000	4739000	Let's move on with some more
4739000	4741000	Gaming news and this one
4741000	4743000	Has to do with the French
4743000	4745000	A French court has banned
4745000	4747000	A DS game copier
4747000	4749000	Prosecutors won an appeal
4749000	4751000	This was two years after
4751000	4753000	French courts actually ruled
4753000	4755000	That DS flash cartridge sellers were okay
4755000	4757000	Well the Paris court of appeals
4757000	4759000	Actually has now ruled against
4759000	4761000	The DS flash cartridge sellers
4761000	4763000	These various companies
4763000	4765000	That sell devices like the
4765000	4767000	R4 device which I think you all know
4767000	4769000	What that is
4769000	4771000	Nintendo I guess said that the companies
4771000	4773000	Have been charged 460,000 euros
4773000	4775000	In criminal fines
4775000	4777000	And 4.8 million in damages
4777000	4779000	To Nintendo
4779000	4781000	Yikes
4781000	4783000	So hmm
4783000	4785000	I guess Nintendo has been taking action on piracy
4785000	4787000	All over the globe
4787000	4789000	And they even have a site I love it
4789000	4791000	There was a site with a very
4791000	4793000	Angry looking Mario on it
4793000	4795000	That discusses the piracy
4795000	4797000	Thought it was interesting
4797000	4799000	So there you go
4799000	4801000	It's a thing
4801000	4803000	And you know what?
4803000	4805000	I wonder if there will be an appeal to the appeal
4805000	4807000	That would be what would be next right?
4807000	4809000	It is the French Rob
4809000	4811000	I mean please
4811000	4813000	They'll have to surrender all their copying devices immediately
4813000	4815000	I couldn't resist
4815000	4817000	Don't get mad
4817000	4819000	I'm not mad
4819000	4821000	I see it
4821000	4823000	You look great
4827000	4829000	Whoo
4829000	4831000	What a game of the week
4831000	4833000	Are we the throughout guards
4833000	4835000	You have 30 seconds we got a suggestion
4835000	4837560	Our hot in
4837560	4839560	Come open the video
4839560	4841560	I need that
4841560	4843560	Come open the video
4843560	4845420	AB.
4845420	4855860	that came out in 1983 when I was years old I love the music in this game a
4855860	4862260	little too happy I think well anyway um it was put up by Namco and in the u.s. it
4862260	4866900	was manufactured and distributed by Valley Midway it is a side-scrolling
4866900	4875580	platformer that has a police mouse and some cats and Mappy basically the game
4875580	4880820	runs on Namco's super pac-man hardware so that's and they modified it to have
4880820	4886460	the horizontal scrolling and it comes from the bulb at least according to the
4886460	4890620	article it says that it's derived from the term mapo which is a slightly
4890620	4895500	insulting name for a policeman whoo so anyway basically you run through a
4895500	4899260	mansion with all these cats club new keys or in the u.s. they were called
4899260	4906180	meow keys and you rescue stolen goods you go left and right and you can jump
4906180	4912540	on these trampolines that will bounce you to different floors and you have one
4912540	4916300	button that lets you open and close doors so you can get a radio 400 points
4916300	4921180	a television for 200 a computer for 300 the Mona Lisa for 400 and a safe for 500
4921180	4925220	but they come in pairs wait how many copies of the Mona Lisa exist I have no
4925220	4931540	friggin clue not in Mappy land which is another game ha ha there was a Mappy
4931540	4937500	land hi there was and it's sitting in my room in the vault so at any rate if you
4937500	4942540	get one item and then get its pair you actually get a score multiplier so the
4942540	4948460	more of those that you get without dying the bigger the multiplier gets so you
4948460	4952140	want to start off at the lowest and go to the highest you can actually get 8500
4952140	4957100	points and so moving for yeah he bounces on trampolines that are in the house
4957100	4962380	because I don't know why a mansion has trampolines in it but it does and Mappy
4962380	4968660	because they're fun Mappy and the cats can only land on a floor on the way up
4968660	4974100	not on the way down but if they pass the air the cats won't hurt Mappy but if
4974100	4977940	they run into him when he's on the plot on a platform then he will lose a life
4977940	4982460	and the trampolines can break if you jump on them four times in a row they'll
4982460	4991660	change colors so basically as you go through the game there is a boss in the
4991660	4999980	game called nyamco which is basically a play on the word namco and nyanco which
4999980	5008060	is like kitty cat but in the u.s. he was named Goro and he's faster but a little
5008060	5014180	less aggressive and so you can he'll actually hide behind different objects
5014180	5019620	so if you go over the object that he's hiding behind you get a thousand points
5019620	5024580	for having caught him so it's kind of cool you've got different hallways like
5024580	5028180	I said you can open and shut doors and keep the mukies out and you have
5028180	5032380	microwave doors which release sound waves that will sweep the kitty cats
5032380	5037620	away did you say microwave doors yeah microwave doors they made popcorn
5037620	5041060	sounds wish that they were like I always consider them to be like sound waves
5041060	5044540	which makes more sense to me but apparently they're microwaves so good
5044540	5052700	thing so um basically after every bonus round you did get bonus rounds after the
5052700	5056940	every fourth level so it's a bonus round and so that's basically you running
5056940	5061820	around on trampolines popping different balloons and nyamco is hidden somewhere
5061820	5066700	in there and after the bonus run you get a new feature in the gameplay after the
5066700	5072860	first one you get attics although there's nothing in them you get after
5072860	5078100	the seventh bonus level you get bells so you can get bells that freeze the cats
5078100	5083660	300 points for each and a thousand points for stunning nyamco you also get
5083660	5088340	hurry signs you know that tell you speed the fuck up you get rainbow floors after
5088340	5093980	the 11th which basically they're mini floors they vanish and they leave a hole
5093980	5096340	in the hallway sorry I didn't mean to interrupt if you guys are doing any
5096340	5100220	excess downloading kill it because we're having buffering problems the live
5100220	5103940	listeners are anything I'm gonna tell anything that's out of my control then
5103940	5107980	yeah our upload will upload and then kind of freeze on a number for a minute
5107980	5110620	and then keep going and it's causing the listeners to be all like what's going on
5110620	5117020	all right well I closed a few things so maybe that'll help right but anyway you
5117020	5120060	just get all these different bonuses including the Rainbow Force and dead ends
5120060	5127580	there are 256 rounds just like impact man and the last one is normal but
5127580	5132540	harder than usual and if you finish it it's also known as round zero the first
5132540	5137140	round starts over again it came out in the Famicom and the nest of course and
5137140	5144700	the MSX in 1984 there was a video game console version only I'm sorry console
5144700	5148540	only version that was called Mappy land which we've discussed it came out in
5148540	5155740	1986 it was also released from Microsoft revenge of the arcade for PC in 1998 and
5155740	5160100	then there were Japanese only sequels that were hopping Mappy that came out in
5160100	5164740	the arcade and Mappy kids for the Famicom in the late 1980s there's Mappy
5164740	5169460	arrangement that came out in the Namco classics volume one which I've got the
5169460	5172700	Famicom version of the original Mappy was re-released in Japan as part of the
5172700	5177180	Famicom miniseries in 2004 Mappy is included on the miss pac-man collection
5177180	5182100	and it's also featured in the Namco Museum 50th anniversary collection that
5182100	5186060	came out on Xbox and on the GameCube PC and PlayStation 2 but not on the GBA and
5186060	5191100	the Namco Museum DS it was also a part of Pacman's arcade party and it's

5201180	5207100	console as far as other references now this I think is kind of cool some people
5207100	5210900	have caught that it's actually Mappy is a playable character in Namco Super Wars
5210900	5215620	on the wonders one color you can get a Mappy hat and Namco cross Capcom in Ridge

5476260	5482180	bit taking over you know the administration of the show all right
5482180	5485340	let's move on I'm wearing me ears all night read you some rapid-fire news so
5485340	5489940	Loki wants to start us off all right well there's a new project headed up by
5489940	5496220	Kenji Inafune and it's revealed as a game called king of pirates and that's
5496220	5502180	coming to the 3ds in 2012 now not too much has been asked by it's a a pirate
5502180	5505860	action game it takes place on a giant ocean it looks very similar to maybe
5505860	5512580	like a Zelda type game or something like that and it is I guess published by
5512580	5518940	marvelous a a QL the makers of the harvest moon series and right now it's
5518940	5523100	only slated for Japan but who knows maybe it'll eventually come out over
5523100	5528780	here in North America so that's pretty cool let's see these actually working on
5528780	5534140	something other than you know nothing since he got canned from Capcom or he
5534140	5543620	left Capcom whatever uh la noir the team behind it team Bondi is shutting down I
5543620	5547100	can see why I can see in this that game I think was delayed and delayed and
5547100	5554140	delayed and delayed and delayed some more but how that would be the delay
5554140	5558420	music here there how's that different from any other freaking video game out
5558420	5565580	there it's like years I mean I don't know but anyways um apparently though
5565580	5572580	they're seeing that la noir was you know a big hit obviously however though
5572580	5577980	because it was in development for seven years it took its toll on the staff in
5577980	5582140	the company because of that they're just kind of dissolving that is a long damn
5582140	5586540	time for a game to be in the studio entered in administration in August and
5586540	5594660	its assets are being sold to an Australian production company Kennedy
5594660	5602500	Miller Mitchell so yeah it is being closed and then finally this is kind of
5602500	5610660	cool battlefield 3 is gonna ship on multiple this on xbox 360 and you know
5610660	5615380	they have one you know disc is dedicated for the single player and then the
5615380	5620100	second disc is multiplayer but also on that second disc is something else it is
5620100	5625540	an optional install that you can do that only give you high res it will be a
5625540	5629300	higher resolution texture pack so make the game look prettier if you want to
5629300	5632740	install it to your hard drive that's kind of neat I think that's kind of cool
5632740	5638420	that's really smart so maybe that will make things look a little bit better I'm
5638420	5642540	assuming it probably pretty much the same as playstation 3 since obviously
5642540	5649820	blu-ray discs have a lot more storage space but that is kind of cool if you're
5649820	5653700	gonna have to despise utilize all of the space right that's a neat idea wonder
5653700	5659380	if other companies will copy that in the future like rage all right well let's
5659380	5665860	move on to a story about VVVVVV and this is about the VVVVVV on the 3ds we're
5665860	5670180	talking about this earlier yep you heard me VVVVVV on the 3ds and it's supposed
5670180	5673900	to be out later this year so we're not talking about something next year it's
5673900	5678180	later this year it's supposed to be available on the 3ds e-shop and it will
5678180	5685420	have some 3d effects now you have to remember VVVVVV is based off of a it's
5685420	5689500	not based off of it it's highly inspired by a Commodore 64 game so that's the
5689500	5693500	style of the graphics so I'm very curious what exactly they're gonna 3d
5693500	5698700	ties with this I'm assuming the sprites are in front textures and back I don't
5698700	5703380	know so we'll see what they do with the 3d effects on this also the way they
5703380	5706420	will utilize the double screen is that the bottom touchscreen will always show
5706420	5710060	the map and the top screen will show the game that you're used to how do you
5710060	5713660	think that'll look on a 3ds I think it'd be cool but I'm worried though because
5713660	5717740	being that the game is very frustrating and you may want to throw your controller
5717740	5722260	throwing the 3ds is probably not a good idea yeah not a good idea they need to
5722260	5725260	put like a little attachment on a 3ds it's like a stress squeeze ball
5725260	5730340	something you can squeeze and get really pissed off so all right also information
5730340	5734940	about Mario Kart 7 which is exciting coming out on the 3ds soon Mario Kart
5734940	5742540	7 the Donkey Kong Returns folks that's right retro studios apparently actually
5742540	5746780	helped develop the Donkey Kong Returns themed level in the game which I think
5746780	5752420	is really cool so that's yep some of the stuff they helped with on the game so I
5752420	5755860	and I like I can see a little bit of the track in here and it looks pretty cool I
5755860	5760500	do like the whole like Mario's has a different variety of cars and the
5760500	5763140	hang gliders and all that although Loki's not as much of a fan I think
5763140	5766820	it'll be kind of cool and I noticed in this one Donkey Kong is riding like this
5766820	5770660	giant tractor looking thing which looks funny they've had different types of
5770660	5776580	cars before in the other games it's just stupid but never that flies where they
5776580	5782740	fly now big deal all right in a fun a cagey in a fun a who of course was the
5782740	5786820	producer of Megaman and he's also done dead rising he doesn't work at Capcom
5786820	5789980	anymore but he's wait are we am I am I double repeating a story that you
5789980	5794460	already did I believe you are I believe I am Rob you way out of practice shame
5794460	5798340	on me all right well then I'll just skip that we'll go to Dark Sakura how did
5798340	5803540	that happen Disney trademarks castle of illusion which was an old you know
5803540	5809300	Genesis game but it was castle illusion starring Mickey Mouse and it is targeted
5809300	5812460	at a video game software so maybe they're gonna re-release it who knows
5812460	5818220	maybe we get in a virtual console also rock band there is going to be a
5818220	5823900	Facebook milestone celebration with Stevie Wonder who it's actually since
5823900	5829100	their Facebook page tops 2 million likes harmonics is letting the news out and
5829100	5836380	saying the rock band 3s DLC is going to be going into let's see we have Stevie
5836380	5840180	Wonder Coldplay Breaking Benjamin and dream theater which having some dream
5840180	5845020	theater on there that's pretty awesome cuz like I know five people who know who
5845020	5851820	dream theater is that's pretty cool and last but never least Steven Spielberg
5851820	5861500	and DreamWorks are backing a halo movie to come out in 2000 false and let me
5861500	5871420	finish thank you for getting sorry it was stated to Microsoft denied that it
5871420	5877020	was in development they go on record saying that it is inaccurate and they
5877020	5880820	have no plan for halo feature right now their focus is developing halo
5880820	5885340	anniversary in halo 4 we all know it's gonna happen eventually though well I
5885340	5891500	mean someday it'll be terrible but then again you know I've talked a lot about
5891500	5894620	the Wow movie before and the World of Warcraft movie I don't think that's ever
5894620	5898300	gonna happen at this point like I think they they missed their chance a couple
5898300	5902380	years ago that sound like a terrible idea well it could have been good but it
5902380	5906980	probably would have been we all know would have been all right guys and we
5906980	5911580	have some big stuff to share you ready we're gonna make a phone call to our old
5911580	5917580	friend why why are who's gonna talk to us about his upcoming project that he's
5917580	5923380	doing on xbox live indie games we're gonna call right now hello zero zero
5923380	5930460	one two three four five six what that's what it says on the caller ID I was
5930460	5934580	Skype is really funny when it does that it's it's funny things over the call ID
5934580	5942340	so why why are how are you doing sir um I think I'll be better once I have time
5942340	5947420	to get some sleep but I am kind of excited for New York comic-con later
5947420	5954740	this week and I'm just doing doing what I can to you know get get done what I
5954740	5959660	need to do on the two games I'm showing you know so that I don't look like
5959660	5962980	complete crap when I'm there so yeah you you've been doing a lot of these
5962980	5966420	conventions and I I bet that's been a really good kind of exposure and help
5966420	5969340	for you because you know I know I knew you were at PAX East a while ago and I
5969340	5973340	think you did it again actually twice now yeah now you got the comic-con
5973340	5977460	coming up it's it's pretty exciting so it is and I'll tell you honestly I
5977460	5981460	haven't gotten a single major gaming site to cover me yet and I'm hoping
5981460	5985260	maybe it'll be different this time but to be completely honest I think the
5985260	5990140	major reason I'm doing it is just to put my put my stuff in front of gamers and
5990140	5994620	to see them you know enjoy playing my stuff like to have a bunch of people
5994620	6000060	crowded around snake 360 battle mode you know that that gets me every time like I
6000060	6003660	love to see that that's all right even if even if there's no chance that I'll
6003660	6009240	be commercially successful just seeing that is enough for me to be honest screw
6009240	6013540	the big game sites you don't get any much you got us you got us we got your
6013540	6017420	back all right so speaking of which um you you are you said you're gonna be
6017420	6020900	showing two games in New York comic-con right so what's what what's the one
6020900	6024900	we're already supposed to know about well the first one is the latest
6024900	6030780	available build of snake 361 and right obviously the sequel to snake 360 and
6030780	6035420	there's a lot of stuff a lot of stuff that's going to be in the new one I mean
6035420	6040060	levels that grow in the campaign because I got criticized about well you know
6040060	6044180	snake is a game about avoiding yourself and well as soon as you get long enough
6044180	6049220	where it's a challenge the levels done and then you start over so in this game
6049220	6054180	you know the campaign has levels that grow as you do and then your challenge
6054180	6058380	to continue going at the length that you're at through a two three four even
6058380	6062820	more part level so that's one thing and then there are other things like
6062820	6066680	survival mode there's still the traditional one but then there's a you
6066680	6070560	know three and five minute you know score rush where you know you're gonna
6070560	6074020	have to take more risks because you only have that much time and then there's
6074020	6078460	something that's really unique and really fun called dual survival and the
6078460	6082180	way that works is every time you take a target you turn around you reverse
6082180	6086140	direction oh god oh you always have to be keeping track of where your head and
6086140	6090900	your tail are it's a lot of fun and it's a really really great challenge my I
6090900	6094500	love how you've kind of taken the concept of snake from the old-school
6094500	6099580	cell phones and just turned it into this just complex game in a way you know it's
6099580	6103100	not all actually you know you've given it some more dimensions you know you
6103100	6106540	should feel a battle mode now there's there's even more modifiers there's like
6106540	6112380	I'm gonna have seven modifiers available at comic-con and you can turn them all
6112380	6118180	on if you want and it's just like you know everything from dead players
6118180	6123260	remaining on the field when you die to again reversing direction every time you
6123260	6130900	take a target to the level continuously shrinking it's it's just got a lot of
6130900	6135460	stuff in there and but the one of the new things I'm premiering at comic-con
6135460	6138500	is something called the challenge mode eventually they're going to be a hundred
6138500	6142340	different challenges but at comic-con they're just ten and it's just you know
6142340	6147260	a scenario okay you're here you're in this level you have to do this you have
6147260	6151540	this much time you have this many movements here are the restrictions okay
6151540	6156740	go and I'm also gonna have a contest if there's anybody who can clear the four
6156740	6160580	hardest challenges that I bring with me in five attempts they can win a year of
6160580	6165020	lives but to be honest I don't think anyone's going to be able to rule you
6165020	6170340	throwing down the gauntlet all right nice someone thinks they can come prove
6170340	6174180	me wrong then they're they're quite welcome nice by the way why we are is
6174180	6177020	live with us this isn't a pre-recorded thing so if you have questions in our
6177020	6181740	chat room go ahead and ask them chat orange launch radio.com I know you're
6181740	6185140	really excited about snake 361 and and so are we it's it's looking to be a
6185140	6191340	great game but I got to tell you I want to talk about project number two well
6191340	6196140	you know what the seeds for project number two were planted a long time
6196140	6202980	ago if you can recall shortly after you know sneak 360 came out and I talked
6202980	6208380	about it right here on OLR you know what one of the weeks like immediately after
6208380	6213300	that you know you guys were throwing around some ideas and it's funny I don't
6213300	6217120	have the chat log but I do distinctly remember that someone was like hey why
6217120	6223340	why are get on that and at the time I didn't but I was just thinking about it
6223340	6227580	and and sometime this summer I said you know what I think I'm going to get on it
6227580	6237760	so I threw together a trailer last night that you know kind of brings back brings
6237760	6242820	back something about you know that it basically I have your discussion in
6242820	6248500	there and yeah it's really the trailer speaks for itself it speaks better than
6248500	6252780	I ever could so why don't we take it away then I'm gonna play this year in
6252780	6255780	studio the trailer and I think you're gonna link it for our chatters if they
6255780	6259100	want to see it and we will also now I know I thought originally this is a
6259100	6262120	YouTube but it's not so we'll figure out a way to get it on tumblr for the
6262120	6268160	podcast easy just uploaded it's a direct it's a direct link to an mp4 download on
6268160	6273500	my site to be honest most people when they click on it either it'll just play
6273500	6276860	or they'll be able to download it to their desktop there'll be a very very
6276860	6280660	very brief delay while it downloads because it's not very big and then it'll
6280660	6286700	play so you know for most people and of course mp4 is a format that pretty much
6286700	6291860	everybody can play most phones even should be able to handle it so I'll get
6291860	6295280	it on the tumblr and I'm sure people can figure it out we got smart listeners so
6295280	6299740	here it is the world premiere of the secret project the yyr has been working
6299740	6306260	on that apparently we have had a hand in unknowingly so here we go start off here
6306260	6310700	of course now I just have to wait for the buffering I just have to wait for
6310700	6316540	the buffering now I should have loaded this in advance yeah shame on me good
6316540	6319700	job you'll live you'll learn this is this would have been a great time to
6319700	6322940	talk about more are you doing any other live appearances this year besides New
6322940	6328180	York comic-con next after this is going to be magfest in January alright which
6328180	6334900	is in the DC area and it's just one big orgasm of gaming and music and gaming
6334900	6338940	related music and it's just it's amazing hold on loaded it loaded we gotta play
6338940	6342300	it I've never seen so many video games in a room before it loaded here we go
6342300	6352900	we on the DS there it return the ferret I command II need to put it like on a bungee cord
6352900	6357260	you just put it on a bungee cord so every time you throw it you can yank it back it's
6357260	6361260	not that I should be encouraging you to do this well wait you know what they
6361260	6364940	need to do wait since we've been talking community games and all this stuff and
6364940	6369020	and all this good Xbox I think shouldn't they have a game called bungee ferret
6369020	6372940	tossing it could be like orange launch radio presents bungee ferret toss add
6372940	6377540	this to the list of orange launch radio dream games or no I add this to the
6377540	6381060	list of orange launch radio reality games I would like to see about the
6381060	6384900	dream game we need to learn how to program or something have a series of
6384900	6387900	games that are soccer you're in school helping take a class on programming
6393620	6398660	our ferret engineers have created time ferrets with a two-second views this is
6398660	6405780	great and you've got a guy dangling from a helicopter and he is throwing ferrets
6405780	6412180	that explode that explode in bloody messes on the unsuspecting people below
6412180	6416180	who are shooting at you who are shooting missiles at you while you fly around it
6416180	6421980	is bungee ferret tossing inspired by olr for better or worse it will be playable
6421980	6427020	at New York comic-con coming to Xbox 360 later this year from I guess a new
6427020	6432940	division that you're working with MRG yeah well it's you know what I came up
6432940	6439540	with an alternate name MRG mostly random games and because basically like my
6439540	6443460	label while our games have always been about just straight-up serious arcade
6443460	6448340	style games right and well this is anything but serious so I wanted to just
6448340	6452620	separated slightly I understand I understand I understand I'm having so
6452620	6456060	much fun with this like and everyone who's tried it so far really loves the
6456060	6460620	concept and to be completely honest the graphics like they're as with my other
6460620	6463820	games they're nothing special and I'm considering having a lot of them
6463820	6469100	redrawn by someone a little more professional than me but it's everyone
6469100	6472620	who's tried it so far they really like the way it plays because basically the
6472620	6480260	thing is you're fighting terrorism of course the ferrets have to fight I want
6480260	6486040	to make you a flyer he's got New York comic-con coming up Friday you should
6486040	6490820	always probably had I actually have something in the printer and by the way
6490820	6494900	there's a big red box on it that says you know the concept of bungee carrot
6494900	6499240	tossing is a joke never throw an animal in real life it's good knowing PETA on
6499240	6503680	your ass unless you can assure me he'll just land with a splat she's too heavy
6503680	6507580	to throw although it could be completely honest I wouldn't be a hundred percent
6507580	6511460	sad if PETA was on my ass because they say any publicity is good publicity
6511460	6514420	right that's true so what so what are you controlling in the game are you
6514420	6519040	controlling the helicopter well this is a great example I think of a game that
6519040	6523620	would not be possible in its current form on a smartphone or on something that
6523620	6527700	doesn't have you know thumbsticks and buttons this is this is going to be I
6527700	6533940	think a great you know piece of ammo in the war on you know oh well cell phones
6533940	6538140	can do everything smartphones can do all kinds of games because basically the way
6538140	6542300	this game works is using the left thumb stick you control the helicopters
6542300	6546500	movement and using the right thumb stick you can control the guy you know the
6546500	6550660	dude I call them hanging on the end of the helicopter if you push the right
6550660	6554340	stick up and down you can control the cord length doesn't dude name and right
6554340	6558660	you can swing wait we need to give dude a name like the hero needs a name
6558660	6567540	Fernando Fernando sure okay I don't like the apple song yeah the drums Fernando
6567540	6572220	his name is Fernando I guess we named your guy Fernando yes I'm writing it
6572220	6578260	down for SSJ 100 Matt here with me actually right if he's a little surprised
6578260	6581940	that I'm writing it down but you know what I'm gonna forget it how could you
6581940	6586660	forget about a song that's kidding well I got so much stuff I'm actually I
6586660	6590940	started the day with no music and sound effects in the game now they're all done
6590940	6597820	and I have to put them in so it's been busy but yeah so anyway Fernando here
6597820	6602200	he's fighting terrorists we discover the location of their base in the dead
6602200	6606980	but the thing is they have advanced stealth radar detection technology so we
6606980	6610900	can't send in the army so instead we send in one stealth helicopter and
6610900	6615780	Fernando who is armed with the latest in ferret weapons technology now you know
6615780	6619580	how they have in movies they have like oh let's show the schematics and you get
6619580	6623940	this screen with like a green grid and on top there's some kind of wireframe
6623940	6629780	image of some you know complicated technology in in the opening sequence
6629780	6633060	when it's eventually done you're gonna see that except it's just going to be
6633060	6641720	ferret dynamite that is amazing third weapons technology and then at the end
6641720	6645760	of the game you realize that the terrorists have somehow reverse
6645760	6650740	engineered the ferret weapons technology and they attempt to use it on you so you
6650740	6655100	know that that's an exciting little thing waiting for you at the end of the
6655100	6660140	game although there's there may be depending on time an alternate boss at
6660140	6665100	the end of hard mode that actually Matt here came up with and it's just as
6665100	6670140	ridiculous as the game concept itself and hopefully I can get that in there so
6670140	6677580	you all can laugh at it well I gotta say I am just sure me stat but on behalf of
6677580	6682340	all of us I'm just like I'm like I'm tickle seriously yeah I think tickled is

6853700	6858340	that's the most awesome thing of our Loki Loki was convinced it was gonna be
6858340	6862020	grandma's got guns I was hoping maybe you know but here's the thing here's the
6862020	6865900	thing if this game does really well like like imagine if it's like on the top of
6865900	6869100	the sales bar and we I think we have a responsibility to get the word out and
6869100	6873020	make sure that this does top the sales charts then what's gonna happen is
6873020	6876580	people are gonna be like wow this game is going good wow those people olr like
6876580	6879900	full are really good ideas we need to start adapting some of their other games
6879900	6888420	and have puzzle sluts blow shit up they're all on the wiki that that's out
6888420	6893100	there and and a lot of times inspired by you guys and somebody's update our wiki
6893100	6896860	to let you know them know that we've actually got a reality yes if somebody
6896860	6902780	has and what's now had a text-based game we did we it's not the first olr
6902780	6906420	inspired game but this is gonna be the first one that you it's on our dream
6906420	6913820	list you can play on a console that's gonna be awesome and it's so somebody
6913820	6919100	just need to put patent-pending yyr on that yeah he has programmed it and we
6919100	6922420	have said we will not sue him right we're not gonna sue him over that we
6922420	6926980	think it's great that he's uh he's running with it so awesome you know
6926980	6931500	since you're mentioning games and making stuff I thought it was kind of cool I
6931500	6939060	actually checked out there is this I happen there's a link or an article or
6939060	6943300	whatever they got it didn't make our show roll it's about a the new my low
6943300	6947260	ponies thing there's a fighting game that someone's making oh yeah I heard
6947260	6953220	about this okay okay well they're using a you know the old it's a fighter or 2d
6953220	6957340	fighter maker I guess is about the same people did RPG maker anyways in
6957340	6962620	searching for 2d fighter maker I came across of this engine it's called engine
6962620	6967060	zero zero one and it's actually something similar to that where you can
6967060	6972780	make your own games but the other thing that they're also adding is Android and
6972780	6978500	iOS support so you'll be able to publish your own games your own iPod games
6978500	6985100	without any programming knowledge Wow wouldn't that be fun oh boy Loki's eyes
6985100	6992020	are lighting up okay awesome all right well um we'll keep you guys posted on
6992020	6998420	that it's I just man I just this show going into its tenth year next year it's
6998420	7002100	like now we have we've won a podcast award you know even though some time ago
7002100	7006860	we've got nominated again we've had a PC game a text-based adventure written on
7006860	7010500	us and now we have like an actual like console graphical thing like a like a
7010500	7013360	more for lack of better term like legit thing you're gonna be able to buy on
7013360	7017900	your console that's inspired by our show it's just it's amazing like like it's
7017900	7024300	like the ultimate compliment for real for real so so excited well I don't know
7024300	7027640	how we follow this with more gaming news but that's what we're gonna do so Loki
7027640	7034460	good luck all right I will I'll try to make it significant so there's an
7034460	7039620	interesting patent that Microsoft is working or has right now that's points
7039620	7043820	to a possible connect based parental controls and what it's gonna do is it's
7043820	7047720	actually gonna look at your proportion tracking your body skeleton that kind of
7047720	7054460	stuff to figure out what age you were probably you know it's gonna take a best
7054460	7063460	guess I guess neat idea I guess but I see a ton of flaws with this one
7063460	7069260	couldn't a child simply unplug the Kinect and boom problem solved no need
7069260	7073100	for parental controls whatsoever and the only way this would really work is if
7073100	7079780	it's actually physically built into the console and then the other thing is what
7079780	7087100	about the short people or you know midgets if you will you know what about
7087100	7093620	them that's not good I don't know I just don't think anything's gonna happen with
7093620	7100700	this but it's a neat concept I guess but once again and once again it really it
7100700	7104940	comes down to our parents gonna set up these parental controls in the first
7104940	7111180	place that's true it's probably gonna be more complex to set up but this
7111180	7114820	discriminates against midgets because gonna scan a little person and it's
7114820	7121340	gonna think it's a child and say no porn for you that is said I mean this is one
7121340	7124700	of those things is like I guess it's an interesting idea but at the end of the
7124700	7127520	day it's also kind of dumb because you know what parental control you should
7127520	7135220	have in your house at all times apparent it is apparent isn't it yes it is very
7135220	7142140	apparent that you should have a parent ha unless you were me as a child moving
7142140	7147140	on I want to move on I don't have to move on why do we always have to know
7147140	7151700	I've gotten fine how about minecraft shit just gonna stop how's that sound
7151700	7156140	we'll just stop no we're not ready for minecraft shit are we yes no we're not
7156140	7161820	we haven't done mailbag yet oh damn look at you look at you trying to cheat try
7161820	7167900	to reminder did you see the ad for the show where every gamer has a boy yeah
7167900	7176340	well well a voice there's no voices in a mailbag it's text all right yeah leave a
7176340	7181140	message I want a voice I think this is a little bit like too late I think but I
7181140	7184300	don't know I want to share this anyway but okay you guys heard about the whole
7184300	7191180	thing where Sony and EA they updated their terms of service so that you can't
7191180	7193980	take them to a class-action lawsuit anymore and the only way you could get
7193980	7199300	out of the class-action lawsuit was to send a letter well there's a website
7199300	7203380	that was created called gamers opt out which was basically a site that you
7203380	7207620	could fill in information online and they would send it in for you
7207620	7215020	interesting so hmm and I guess there was some concern at first that a legal
7215020	7219180	person had registered this website but turned out after some investigation it's
7219180	7222780	not at some some dude up in Michigan who's just really mad about this like a
7222780	7226160	lot of people are really and it's a pretty interesting concept the only
7226160	7230980	bummer is that Sony term of service thing happened already like six weeks
7230980	7237540	ago at this point wasn't it hold on yes it happened but that is only if you've
7237540	7241820	agreed to it and you can only agree to it if you've updated your system if you
7241820	7245500	haven't updated your system you haven't made any sort of agreement yet I would
7245500	7248860	just assume that most people have done that by now but I guess if you haven't
7248860	7252460	for whatever reason then you could still use this like I haven't because I
7252460	7259420	haven't played a PlayStation 3 online for ever so I think it's a neat concept
7259420	7263900	you know and I hey if somebody's gonna do the work for me I'm all for it but at
7263900	7268980	the end of the day you know why does Sony get to set all the rules in regards
7268980	7271820	to what you can and can't do legally like yes I know there's a Supreme Court
7271820	7276300	precedent and all that stuff but I don't know it just kind of seems wrong but at
7276300	7280580	the same time what do class-action lawsuits really accomplish either like
7280580	7284780	everybody gets a coupon or everybody gets like 50 cents you know usually
7284780	7289420	class-action lawsuits don't end with with much of anything so that's why I'm
7289420	7294620	not as mad about it but it does kind of it's more of a principle it's more the
7294620	7299260	principle I think at the end of the day yeah and when you know really how often
7299260	7306260	do you know do you or I actually file a lawsuit against a company I mean right
7306260	7311180	never right well sometimes you jump in on class-action lawsuits though yeah but
7311180	7313860	that's because you don't really have to do anything yeah what's the worst it's
7313860	7316940	gonna happen I'm not gonna lose any money so might as well you know see if I
7316940	7320340	get something but I think that's really the only reason people jump in on this
7320340	7325300	stuff but I mean I would think if Sony did something to piss me off and let's
7325300	7330020	say they just you know sold my house underneath me and you know took all my
7330020	7334260	assets or something like that for some sort of weird claws or something that
7334260	7339060	they had I can't see myself really suing them I'd just be like well I'm just not
7339060	7346500	gonna buy your next console or game or whatever you know that you have all
7346500	7350540	right well we're gonna move on to dark soccer's favorite part of the show let
7350540	7355420	me get her properly riled up for the mailbag you got to see this this picture
7355420	7359220	dark soccer meekly top so you know who to blame he sent this to me from
7359220	7367060	Facebook and it was labeled girls version of an Xbox you ready it's a
7367060	7378500	picture of an oven she has her finger up I only forgive him because he introduced
7378500	7383620	me to that band that I like now you mad there actually is I never knew this on
7383620	7388940	Facebook there actually is a page called the girl version of an Xbox that's for
7388940	7397580	donk so email first email hold on now that I ever properly riled up to reach
7397580	7405940	your emails at mailbag at orange lounge radio.com men suck it's totally sexist
7405940	7418260	I'm sorry it's it's wrong and really funny shut up and read the email well
7418260	7423020	you know what you know how long ago was the fucking movie I mean seriously does
7423020	7426420	anyone shut up that's just like you know your challenge radio gods I just wanted
7426420	7429620	to chime in on the Final Fantasy 10 remake discussion from last week's show
7429620	7434140	personally I'm excited extremely excited about this Final Fantasy 10 is my
7434140	7439700	favorite RPG ever not only is the battle system fun and has really awesome
7439700	7444420	awesome summons that are actually useful unlike Final Fantasy 13 but the game has
7444420	7448540	an emotional musical score and a storyline with compelling character cast
7448540	7454460	I don't understand why people complain about the voice of Titus or even the
7454460	7457820	character itself for one thing I love hearing his narrations and thoughts on
7457820	7461580	how you go through the story which reminds me of kiln and the melancholy of
7461580	7467100	Haruhi Suzumiya kind of and for people who have a problem with the character
7467100	7470300	itself he's just being realistic people he asks a lot of questions and gets
7470300	7473780	emotionally stressed because one he's in a world unknown to him and to the other
7473780	7477780	characters do keep a lot from him until later in the story and when something as
7477780	7482340	important as a loved one self-sacrifice it can take quite a toll on someone give
7482340	7485780	squirts off to break for having a character we can somewhat relate to geez
7485780	7489900	and this one's directed to me and Jamie I completely agree with you on Final
7489900	7494700	Fantasy 10 to the game is just loads of fun and the gestures make it really
7494700	7498220	interesting in all honesty if you were a person who loved Final Fantasy tactics
7498220	7502780	with the different classes and Final Fantasy 7 active time battle system then
7502780	7506180	there is no reason you shouldn't have fun with this game unless you hate
7506180	7509460	Charlie's Angels with all of your being also a thousand words is one of my
7509460	7515140	favorite Final Fantasy songs one more note about on the Final Fantasy 10 vs.
7515140	7518900	7 remake argument that people keep on having let's look at it this way Final
7518900	7523600	Fantasy 7 got a prequel a cell phone game a shooter an anime a movie and a
7523600	7527940	special edition of the movie with more scenes Final Fantasy 10 got a sequel and
7527940	7532420	that's it let's spread the love around people thanks for reading Oscar ps Rob
7532420	7537340	did you ever finish Final Fantasy 13 no I'm like in the last chapter and I never
7537340	7541660	finished it cuz I suck but I keep thinking about doing that too I really
7541660	7545260	want to play 13 too so I think I need to finish but at least I know I have until
7545260	7548940	what like January or February hey you want to hear something funny since I'm
7548940	7554980	gonna be real the show right now sure um I'm gonna read a book what yeah you're
7554980	7563700	like me we know you can read that was my middle finger going up Wow so in the
7563700	7567060	last five minutes dark soccer's finger went up Loki's finger went up now
7567060	7571100	everybody in chat room guess when's my finger gonna go up right now no it's uh
7571100	7576340	it's something completely appropriate ready player one it's basically kind of
7576340	7582980	the way I've I think the story is like is it's very much like Charlie and the
7582980	7587700	Chocolate Factory meets a bunch of 80s references and a bunch of sci-fi video
7587700	7592740	game references basically this guy has this kind of think of it like Second
7592740	7599260	Life this giant universe cyberspace that people go to and he's gonna die but he's
7599260	7604460	leaving it for the person that finds this key in the thing and so this kid
7604460	7608340	from the ghetto or whatever builds this computer and ends up trying to go in
7608340	7611700	there to find the key so it's very much like you know Charlie Chocolate Factory
7611700	7616860	but there's you know references to all things like sci-fi and video games and
7616860	7621380	stuff like you know they've got the the owl ship from Watchmen in there the
7621380	7627020	DeLorean movie out of this like the movie oh they are okay but it's just
7627020	7634380	really it sounds cool and that's like part of the plot for spiral yeah my wife
7634380	7638700	was very surprised that I would read a book and I don't read but I don't read
7638700	7642820	books very often I used to I used to read sci-fi books and like you're like
7642820	7646020	me I I used to read books all the time when I was growing up like I used to
7646020	7650100	love the scary books like that was what was his name Christopher Pike goosebumps
7650100	7654180	is that the guy no it was different well maybe Arl Stein yeah I was a Pike Pike
7654180	7658260	the name Arl Stein and yeah his books I used to read a lot of those and I read I
7658260	7661260	read some other stuff too you should see the book that I finished in two days
7661260	7664540	actually I liked a lot of even though I hear he was a total asshole I liked a
7664540	7667620	lot of the rolled all stuff like Charlie Chocolate Factory in glass elevator and
7667620	7671420	and James the giant peach and the boy I think the boy who ruled the world
7671420	7674580	something like that well maybe if it's good I will loan you the book afterwards
7674580	7677820	after my wife reads it cuz she's supposed to read it well hopefully
7677820	7681900	somebody will buy me an iPad so I can play with gadgets when I read books it's
7681900	7684740	not that I by the way it's not that I'm like reading sucks it's just that the
7684740	7689880	internet has kind of like like instead of reading I pull up Wikipedia on my
7689880	7692780	phone and I'm just looking at Wikipedia articles like that's kind of what it's
7692780	7696100	turned into like my reading is now what attention span theater see the stuff
7696100	7702000	that I've actually started reading it again lately is reading anthropology
7702000	7707740	studies I'm not I've never been a fan of historical fiction so I put down one
7707740	7714820	historical fiction I was reading but I like I've been reading cultural books
7714820	7719100	and the book I just finished was geisha by Liza Dalby she actually worked as a
7719100	7724180	geisha in the 70s it's her doctoral thesis so that's what I've been reading
7724180	7727220	lately it's not that I hate reading I just have a really short attention span
7727220	7731100	but apparently it's good it is it is actually on the iOS bookstore whatever
7731100	7735580	it's actually in what it's on the New York Times bestsellers list right now
7735580	7741740	so okay if you like I mean that Kotaku actually was the one that kind of turned
7741740	7746940	me on to that they ran an article about the book and with some screen it wasn't
7746940	7750220	it was concept art I think for a screenplay because he's wrote a
7750220	7754700	screenplay for it as well that will probably become a movie but well and I
7754700	7757420	was wrong it's not that it sounds like spiral is that it sounds like the third
7757420	7763060	book loop in the virus the ring the ring spiral and loop it sounds kind of like
7763060	7767260	loop yeah but with video game references yeah all right let's get back to the
7767260	7772900	emails here we go okay um the first one's from Holly we got two from Holly
7772900	7777020	but they're short so Molly says you were forgiven PS I ate your Xbox connector
7777020	7781380	cables what is that uh it was because Loki was talking about the dog but that

7929060	7933020	all played it and during the beta we're like this game is shit but they I didn't
7933020	7937980	they've tweaked a lot of stuff and he's telling me like it's more like 11 now

7946300	7949100	this is Shane we're talking about and he's really good at making people do
7949100	7952860	things they don't want to do so I don't know maybe I will have to try it well
7952860	7957220	hold on I'm just curious because you know it's kind of sucked and I'm
7957220	7961900	wondering how much it's going for you know $25 on Amazon if I'm not mistaken

8013380	8017580	interested by the PlayStation being placed at 13 and intended reaching 16
8017580	8021900	with the Xbox not featuring is the Xbox really not cool apparently we don't
8021900	8027980	think so in the UK but yeah it's never going to stand up to the coolest levels
8027980	8031660	of an Aston haha true thanks care guys love your work Lee

8039060	8043900	yeah the Aston Martin is number one okay so I'm just gonna fly through the list
8043900	8048500	in order and I can understand these okay so we have Aston Martin is number one
8048500	8054660	Apple Harley Davidson Rolex banging Olafson Blackberry Google Ferrari Nike

8110500	8116460	would be epic all right let's move on yeah we got more emails okay a very
8116460	8122980	feminine James Bond okay this comes from zither who zither is actually my new
8122980	8128740	buddy now for introducing me to a different PC engine thingy so I listened
8128740	8132380	to episode 428 recently and near the end dark soccer was talking about the PC
8132380	8136820	engine and turbo graphics 16 emulation and mentioned magic engine I used to use
8136820	8140180	magic engine to emulate but later I came across an emulator that's a lot better
8140180	8145660	it's called Oh Taki oh it's oh oh ta ke and it was developed by Japanese guy
8145660	8148780	from what I remember hearing magic engine has some input lag which is a
8148780	8153620	common hindrance in emulators and Oh Taki Oh Taki has practically none at all
8153620	8156860	plus it's free as opposed to magic engine where you have to pay I'd say
8156860	8161180	it's very worthwhile emulator for the sole reason that it's free also I am
8161180	8165300	with dark Sakura and hoping that planet Harriers can get emulated just recently
8165300	8169460	someone managed to get Sega's model 3 hardware almost emulated and I hope that
8169460	8172500	another James can crack the Hikaru and emulate it too you were gonna say
8172500	8179740	something no I'm sorry I'm just Mouse being retarded no keep being one of the
8179740	8183340	best gaming podcasts out there I'm so glad I came across you guys I've been

8374020	8378460	just murdering after Dead Island um who do I talk to you about purchasing the
8378460	8384100	DTR freak domain name it would feel like I would be owning a piece of the past a
8384100	8387140	relic from a different time when I was younger anyways at this point all of our
8387140	8391300	posts on the form will be lost in time like tears in rain for the record
8391300	8398940	probably not because I'm sure Jason still has the the forum logs that would
8398940	8403340	be terrible to like troll it and just put like coming back soon and then just
8403340	8407820	never ever I don't ever I don't I don't see it being let go of honestly I don't
8407820	8411220	see being let go of either but let it be known if they if they are you've got
8411220	8414900	competition because if they do put that domain up for sale I want it and I will
8414900	8419100	I will put it put it to a legitimate purpose and will not sell it spam
8419100	8426540	whatever I I want it absolutely but I have a dog I know other people want it
8426540	8432140	too so I'm not holding my breath but if I could get it I would take it so moving
8432140	8436980	forward I mentioned this a year ago when a backlog turned into 30-plus titles is
8436980	8442420	it no longer a gaming backlog but a back jam and he shows us a picture of his
8442420	8450340	plates and says DDR player that's great and my the plates on my car is still
8450340	8456900	says DDR plyr but on my newer car 2010 Mazda mx-5 Miata shout out to all of our
8456900	8462900	peace and triple-a I hope you have triple-a if you've got a Miata shit get
8462900	8470660	some triple-a so yeah all right was that it for emails yes well if you want to
8470660	8475100	make Jamie work mailbag at orange lounge radio.com send us more email I will cut
8475100	8479740	a bitch if you yes we are reading emails again all right let's move on
8479740	8486580	Loki okay look he's already trying to see if the domains available I know I
8486580	8491260	know it's not somebody would have snatched up by now if it was there it is
8491260	8500340	that's right anyways so let's talk a little bit about Sony and you know they
8500340	8506740	have the phone brand Ericsson well they actually may be buying out Ericsson it's
8506740	8509980	interesting this is coming from the Wall Street Journal and apparently they're
8509980	8513460	gonna be buying out Ericsson the mobile phone company I guess they teamed up
8513460	8518220	with back in 2001 and of course they just recently released the Xperia play
8518220	8526300	through the Ericsson line and of course they're gonna have you know the new
8526300	8531060	PlayStation Vita and the phone stuff and they're gonna have you know the store to
8531060	8535820	go along with that well it's interesting because if Sony Ericsson you know
8535820	8542460	becomes just Sony mobile then basically the first thing they would do is you
8542460	8547380	have a PlayStation phone that's actually a PlayStation phone instead of just this
8547380	8552220	experience player some roundabout weird name like that which people still dub it
8552220	8556300	the PlayStation phone but if Sony actually has their own true phone company
8556300	8562380	then our phone you know hardware manufacturer that'd be kind of neat
8562380	8567820	they'd be joining up I guess against you know Apple even taking them on you know
8567820	8577500	headfirst be interesting I don't know has it worked for the computers because
8577500	8584780	they're damn fucking expensive yeah for real but apples are very expensive as
8584780	8592540	well people buy those that's true this is about just having that status well
8592540	8596220	there's a lot of games looking to be getting that same status as well you
8596220	8598740	know you kind of heard why we are talk about a little bit when he was on the
8598740	8601260	phone earlier is it sometimes it's kind of hard to get noticed and get coverage
8601260	8605180	on a lot of the big sites well Activision is trying to help some indie
8605180	8609340	games get exposure there's an indie games competition that they did before
8609340	8613420	and I guess what happened is that the publisher is going to be doing this
8613420	8619300	again offering two hundred and fifty thousand dollars to two indie developers
8619300	8623620	ownership of submission rights will remain with the creator they're very
8623620	8628220	important to put that in the press release and yeah there you go
8628220	8632780	Activision is working with IndieCade to actually do the contest and it'll be
8632780	8638940	open for submissions from now through December 31st that's awesome
8638940	8644980	hopefully can oh maybe yyr should submit bungee ferret tossing as you know the
8644980	8653180	future of gaming all right anyhow dark soccer what do you got for us well as I
8653180	8658100	brought up earlier when I was trying to skip doing of a mailbag
8658100	8664260	Minecraft has something new in it there have been screenshots released from work
8664260	8675420	in progress version that has dragons dragons so it's either supposed to go in
8675420	8682420	there or maybe not ever but the creator has been tweeting that texturing the
8682420	8689100	dragon was interesting so it looks kind of blocky like everything in Minecraft
8689100	8697780	does yeah dragons that's it all right it would be needs I guess I mean he keeps
8697780	8702740	adding more and more things to kill you in the game so I kind of probably would
8702740	8711940	impede on building stuff I would think the constant death my guess at least so
8711940	8715140	this is also cool since we were talking a little bit about indie games and stuff
8715140	8720340	on live is actually putting on some new indie games this fall and some of these
8720340	8724820	actually might recognize because they've been hitting different console platforms
8724820	8729620	as well as PC including orcs must die which was just released on Xbox Live
8729620	8739380	Arcade limbo magica bastion space chem and Avadon the Black Fortress and those
8739380	8744580	are on being added to already existing indie games that are on there including
8744580	8749820	braid trying world of goo and the mall so that's kind of cool that there will
8749820	8757580	be kind of a showcase of all sorts of games not just you know streaming games
8757980	8761660	awesome it's good that on live is actually getting more games because
8761660	8765020	that's kind of where they're hurting right now you know what I mean yeah so
8765020	8768340	it's always a good thing just a couple more stories for you guys then we're
8768340	8772020	going to go to the Twitter with twitter.com slash olr I haven't seen hardly
8772020	8776180	anything show up on there so maybe after I say that it will or also there's going
8776180	8782260	to be the skype line of course one eight seven seven game olr in just a moment I
8782260	8790900	guess this is interesting I a study was done by website bundle who tracks credit
8790900	8794620	card spending nice I'm sure that works but I guess they track all the
8794620	8800020	transactions or whatever and what the study did is that it looked at it looked
8800020	8805300	at games from EB and steam and GameStop and all these sales from July 2010 to
8805300	8810740	June 2011 and looked at the top 100 cities in the US by population the city
8810740	8816780	that bought the most games Huntington New York kind of random right yeah I
8816780	8821860	mean that's I'm assuming that's upstate certainly not you know the big city but
8821860	8830100	also in the list here locally at number five Modesto a laugh because like
8830100	8835660	Modesto's like it's halfway between here and Fresno like what else can I say
8835660	8841780	about Modesto was also on this you know what else was on the list Stockton was
8841780	8846100	stocked on list of Fresno's it not like they have much to do there Sacramento's
8846100	8850060	not even on the list a lot of these strike me as like suburb II things well
8850060	8853780	then again Pittsburgh's like number six so there are Chesapeake Virginia's
8853780	8859500	number four so there are some bigger cities that are on there I don't know
8859500	8863180	interesting Denver Virginia beaches at ten those are aren't they like right
8863180	8867580	near each other Miami think they are so there you go that's your list of game
8867580	8872940	oh yeah Stockton number 41 hello Stockton so I guess those are the big
8872940	8876700	cities that buy video games probably cuz there's nothing else to do and Rama says
8876700	8879820	Huntington is Long Island thank you sorry we're California kids we don't
8879820	8885460	know our East Coast geography as well Huntington is Long Island hmm all right
8885460	8889100	one more one more story I threw this in here at the last minute because it's
8889100	8893500	it's related to to music games and DDR which by the way I did a little research
8893500	8898660	on the DDR freak domain it's registered through July 2017 so we won't be getting
8898660	8903340	that anytime soon that's not surprising at all though I mean that site probably
8903340	8906300	still generates quite a bit of traffic even though it's not there did it ever
8906300	8911220	like come back up no or did the server get I know the servers are like getting
8911220	8915380	unplugged or whatever yeah it's it's not back up it's still just the demo just
8915380	8922420	goes to go daddy Wow and if you you know click on the the register it thing then
8922420	8928220	it has you go to one of those buy out a used domain theme was it expiring anyway
8928220	8941460	no I don't think so interesting we'll have to figure out what's going on huh
8941460	8947020	all right well anyway this story is about a movie that's happening it's a
8947020	8952140	3d movie and it's supposed to feature scenes from pump it up or whatever it's
8952140	8956860	targeted at tweens and teens and it's supposed to be about dancing game and a
8956860	8961500	girl who's bullied by her peers over I guess the lack of skills of the game
8961500	8965980	it's gonna have its premiere at the end of October in Burbank California but
8965980	8970620	like seriously look at this just look at this you guys based on true events
8970620	8973940	you see what she's wearing right now I look so much better than her it's not
8973940	9002940	even competition it's nothing personal super jets DX
9004740	9009580	this whole thing looks like it was shot in front of a green screen
9010780	9014220	you know what that looks like to me to be real like this is the arc music
9014220	9019300	factory equivalent of movies is what this is and you just say enjoy your rep
9019300	9022780	Rebecca black music on your way to watch this premiere if you go like I don't
9022780	9031020	care that it's about a dance game it's only just kind of sad that's all so um
9031020	9040900	yeah Alex terrible sure does all right well is it a world premiere if no one
9040900	9049140	goes to see it it's a neighborhood premiere it's a street premiere all

9096420	9100540	dark Tetsuya not our Sakura she's here dark Tetsuya says on the topic of DDR
9100540	9104500	freak have you heard about this reunion tournament thing they're doing I hope we
9104500	9109060	can show support for him somehow uh good question I had heard there was supposed
9109060	9113740	to be an event on 20 November is that even a weekend that this is happening
9113740	9119900	20 November Thursday so it would have to be like 20 oh no I'm looking at 20
9119900	9124820	November is a Sunday I'm all for it if they do a meet up on 20 November but no
9124820	9128780	I haven't heard anything since the original Facebook poll so we need to
9128780	9132460	look at Facebook and follow up on that I don't know but we'll find out that's a
9132460	9135580	good question meanwhile let's go to the phones hire on
9135580	9140920	orange launch radio who's this some Shane what's up Shane I didn't know what
9140920	9145160	name I was gonna use so I changed it midway so sometimes sometimes we call
9145160	9151980	you meekly top and now you're Shane Shane nothing I'm just enjoying Final
9151980	9155820	Fantasy 14 right now did you hear did you hear us talking about that earlier
9155820	9160020	no because your feed sucks tonight I it's not us I don't know what's going on
9160020	9164100	we're trying all games I know but I'm still going but all games you know what
9164100	9166980	they give it to us for free so if they have an off night I can't get to well
9166980	9177380	you can get AIDS for free to use it Shane now that is a quote it does have a
9177380	9184980	point you can get yours for free comparing yours with a pretty accurate I
9184980	9188980	like yet you can probably get like Mexican labors for free you don't want
9188980	9195420	them either Final Fantasy 14 you can pay 25 bucks for and yet now you say this is
9195420	9198580	worth it I think you can actually get a little cheaper than that but yeah all
9198580	9202220	right so fine you can get it on eBay or whatever but now you have come around on
9202220	9206340	Final Fantasy 14 and you say Final Fantasy 14 is worth it yes it only took
9206340	9211060	a year of them completely overhauling the game for it to be playable alright
9211060	9216140	so how is this game gone from bad to good in your opinion well I mean it's
9216140	9222740	turned into what it looked like from the get-go a Final Fantasy 11 clone and we
9222740	9229460	played that for years and years and it it's fun I am enjoying my time I like it
9229460	9234060	because it's got like a real story you get invested in and I keep deleting my
9234060	9238060	characters and starting them over playing the intro areas because one of
9238060	9242260	them is like so depressing at the end because this little girl has her father
9242260	9247660	killed by one of these big ugly I forget what they're called like gob use or
9247660	9252940	something from Final Fantasy 11 but because 14 had to take everything from
9252940	9255860	11 and just change the name and that's how they were making it new and
9255860	9261140	exciting right yep and they updated the graphics so it's pretty like I like
9261140	9264100	making my character over and over again too because I can't decide on the hair
9264100	9268800	color what's wrong with blue I thought you did blue everything nope nope they
9268800	9272380	don't have a good color of blue so I went with brown but there's like eight
9272380	9277140	different shades of brown so I keep starting and like oh this is good for
9277140	9284700	five minutes but I need a different brown color so the game is fun huh yes
9284700	9288280	that means they're gonna start charging for it soon probably not because I
9288280	9292660	remember reading a quote saying that they would not start charging until the
9292660	9298020	game was at the point that they wanted it to be at and recently with this new
9298020	9302180	patch that came out this week they said that they feel the game is only halfway
9302180	9307300	to that goal of being you know where they would want it to be as a playable
9307300	9312820	game and that took a year so I'm hoping for another year free not paying for it
9312820	9317980	every month and if it keeps up like that I'll continue to play and maybe if I get
9317980	9323140	past level five and they got rid of the physical level so it's only one level
9323140	9328300	your class level no longer like class for physical six or something stupid
9328300	9333180	like that so maybe if I get past level five and I'll like it even more and I
9333180	9336780	want to keep playing it cuz I mean it is technically one of the cheaper MMOs to
9336780	9343900	play monthly it's only like 12 I guess but that mean what Wow's 15 most are
9343900	9347000	priced in that area right how much is the Star Wars that memo gonna be do we
9347000	9350740	know yet 15 they said per month unless you do like the same thing well does
9350740	9354140	where if you pay for like six months at a time you get like for a dollar cheaper
9354140	9362540	per month technically right isn't worth it live listeners um our feed went down
9362540	9365820	but it's back up and that was us when amp crashed I don't know what it's
9365820	9369500	probably got sick of all the delay stuff that's going on on the other side I
9369500	9372740	don't know so I know you should just like let everybody call into Skype and
9372740	9379220	then we could just listen that way party you have a Skype party um but anyway if
9379220	9383140	we're done talking about that real quick I also wanted to mention that tap sonic
9383140	9387220	has also been taking over for me really um they updated the free songs and they
9387220	9394260	added some quote unquote American songs they're actually pretty fun to play like
9394260	9399180	passion pits on there Gwen Stefani is on there and then some new kpop got added
9399180	9402900	for free because I don't pay for stuff on that yet because I don't like micro
9402900	9406740	transactions right and you have to pay like each time you play a song right
9406740	9413820	yeah extra don't like that's dumb um and also technica threes soundtrack got
9413820	9418660	leaked and it's all over YouTube and I love it is there anything I'd actually
9418660	9424460	know huh is there anything I'd actually know in it uh it's got sampling masters
9424460	9430140	in it they do a song but I guess one of the people from sampling masters has
9430140	9433860	been the past few games and I didn't know that no but they put it like a lot
9433860	9437380	of happy hardcore in there like stuff I could see I'm one of the happy to be
9437380	9442940	hardcore CDs and it's really good and I love it all right well we're gonna
9442940	9446780	invite keyboard lights up I got a new keyboard and it's changing colors a lot
9446780	9450460	all right we're gonna let you go so we get some more calls here that's fine I
9450460	9454140	just won't be able to listen to what you guys say after this well we had the
9454140	9460780	crash so try again maybe it's better now who knows doubt it fine bye bye so rude
9460780	9466500	he's so optimistic he really is what an ass let's go to the phones and see if
9466500	9472420	our next caller is nicer hi you're on orange launch radio who's this hello
9472420	9477380	hola bienvenidos a orange lounge radio who's this stunned into silence hang up
9477380	9481300	there's a crank collar I guess they knew their connection wasn't working I don't
9481300	9487220	know 1 8 7 7 game olr or a username on skype is orange lounge radio and in the
9487220	9492180	meantime I'll try to go back to Twitter except I closed Firefox like a genius
9492180	9497100	genius I guess we could have kept Shane on that you know be optimistic about
9497100	9505260	things a little more I like Shane I like him when he's appropriate no I'm just
9505260	9508220	kidding I guess isn't appropriateness is part of what makes him
9508220	9516180	Shane right yep yes and you take your friends as they are or yes murder them
9516180	9521820	in their sleep I mean you take them as they are all right let's go to our
9521820	9525660	Twitter topics because I know we have at least a couple more coming in here now
9525660	9532200	Tigerclaw sent us some tweets take down notice against some Battlestar Galactica
9532200	9538900	modders this is a tweet a twink a tweet to us from Tigerclaw let's see a
9538900	9544520	Battlestar Galactica mod for Nexus and I guess this made the attention of NBC
9544520	9549560	Universal who sent a cease and desist letter to mod DB who'd been hosting the
9549560	9554260	work on it I don't even wow I don't even know what this is about here but of
9554260	9560500	course there is already a Battlestar Galactica online game so I'm sure this
9560500	9565020	is definitely a conflict of interest when you put Battlestar Galactica into
9565020	9570780	another game well it's also you know if you're doing a mod that's like with
9570780	9575740	licensed properties and stuff like that I mean that's kind of to be expected if
9575740	9581740	you know if you're doing your own mod or something like that you know and that's
9581740	9586060	a little different by the way this game had to remove everything that was
9586060	9593340	related to Battlestar Galactica so not just the popular one so bummer all right
9593340	9601140	let's see also hold on why are you calling back I don't know you didn't
9601140	9607420	have any other callers like I should tell time I just was slow in getting the
9607420	9612740	Twitter loaded I don't think so no yes I was sounded like because I had the feed
9612740	9617580	up and running and was the fees working now he was calling yeah if he was back
9617580	9623940	well then there you go yeah so I called so Battlestar Galactica season to say I
9623940	9629900	love that I'll start Galactica I know about that but as it has nothing to do
9629900	9635220	with the story did you even hear the story yes okay what was the story
9635220	9640140	NVC made them shut down some mod for some game that nobody plays okay good
9640140	9646660	job you pass pass the test so are you sad that they had to take down the mods
9646660	9649620	or you just I don't know how if you love Battlestar Galactica so much here's my
9649620	9652900	real question if you love it so much why aren't you playing the MMO I did for a
9652900	9657100	day and it was terrible really so I didn't play it anymore why was it
9657100	9662900	terrible I couldn't control my Cylon ship and I was like this isn't realistic
9662900	9670420	at all I'd be making out with helo or yeah that's really is awesome that's
9670420	9675540	absolutely realistic I'm sure in bow star Galactica it would be because he
9675540	9682260	loves Cylons and I was a Cylon all right all right I'm hanging up on you to get
9682260	9686760	some other calls you're tying up okay if there are finally people calling by one
9686760	9692340	eight seven seven game olr or username on skype is orange lounge radio so
9692340	9695780	meletops gone and we do have another call coming in so let's see
9695780	9701140	hi you're on orange lounge radio who's this oh it's legend of Zaku hey legend
9701140	9705660	of Zaku how you doing pretty good been doing stressful at work but you know
9705660	9709580	been hanging in there I hear usual it's been stressful my work too what's on
9709580	9716300	your mind buddy just the usual you know grasp of the fact that um even though
9716300	9722140	Steve Jobs did pass away it's like he his legacy in terms of how how he's
9722140	9727140	actually laid out a plan that might actually impact the way we view you know
9727140	9731060	any like portable dedicated gaming systems I'm just saying the fact that
9731060	9735420	you know his passing is pretty much you know give me a little bit of time to
9735420	9739700	reflect that mobile gaming might actually you know unless unless Nintendo
9739700	9743740	gets into the business selling phones well Sony's getting there getting there
9743740	9746940	as long as they buy out Erickson then they'll be set well but I'm more
9746940	9749980	concerned about Nintendo and the fact that they just like shrug it off with a
9749980	9753860	cavalier attitude if Nintendo you know started selling phones and they would
9753860	9758500	have to acknowledge the fact that there's online and well exactly you know
9758500	9763100	how that and this is and this is where you know these uh these mobile these
9763100	9767580	mobile game developers they they target that audience where they're basically
9767580	9772580	pissing in the same pool that Nintendo is you know spent hard cultivating ever
9772580	9776660	since the game the days of the Gameboy but the idea is that they're going after
9776660	9782860	the casuals I know it's a segment of the market that's like it's it's really hard
9782860	9786540	to break in because these are people who aren't like you know they're just
9786540	9790940	they're just typical folks they're not like your your average gamer you know
9790940	9795940	but the idea is that Nintendo it's you know they have such they're just
9795940	9799500	shrugging it off and they're good they're being so naive about like not
9799500	9803920	adapting like not realizing that the guys who you know the creators of Angry
9803920	9807780	Birds at the end of the day they're still gonna make bank while Nintendo is
9807780	9810900	gonna be scratching their head as to why they're not innovating why they're not
9810900	9816340	staying ahead of the curve and you can see as the Wii U you resolve the Wii U
9816340	9824620	is innovative the Wii U it's about you and it's just a Wii with a you know with
9824620	9828900	the touch remote and suppose it suppose it better graphics even though it's like
9828900	9833060	it's still being worked out hold on hold on hold on hold on cycle hold that
9833060	9835500	thought there's something really important I hate to interrupt our Sakura
9835500	9840980	are you really reading about Final Fantasy 14 over there yeah I was curious
9840980	9845140	oh dear it doesn't mean I'm gonna play it I was just looking you were
9845140	9848100	experimenting did I catch you experimenting in the middle of the show
9848100	9853740	I was just looking all right I had to give you crap all right sorry yeah it's
9853740	9858900	like you know it's if Nintendo were really you know if they were serious
9858900	9863300	about like trying to capture the the casuals they would have to like they
9863300	9867100	they wouldn't just act like they wouldn't have like an arrogant tone and
9867100	9871180	that's what I'm hearing you know that's what I hear from their bosses like they
9871180	9875780	they hate the the guy they're hating on the folks who you know on the Angry
9875780	9880300	Birds folks so the indie devs because at the end of the day who you know they're
9880300	9884120	gonna be pissed when their lunch gets eaten you know by those guys Steve
9884120	9887700	Steve Jobs his impact is gonna be felt for a long time and you know you were
9887700	9889860	mentioning about kind of his style I think a little bit there at the
9889860	9892500	beginning of the call did you hear that news report about that they're gonna
9892500	9898540	have executives kind of be taught on his styles well that's the thing you can't
9898540	9903900	really teach you can't really teach anyone else that type of style you know
9903900	9907940	you're with that ability to be a perfectionist I can I got it you can't
9907940	9912260	really teach an artist especially one that's born into it born with that
9912260	9915900	talent I mean you're sure they can become artists and they grow to realize
9915900	9919580	that they have the talent within them but you can't just force that person to
9919580	9924180	be a perfectionist to be as as meticulous as he was I mean you're bad
9924180	9927960	for that new guy a little the fact that he managed to change the you know my
9927960	9932300	industry which I actually do work in mobile so I was you know I was you know
9932300	9936020	the day that the day of the iPhone came out I realized that yeah I was gonna
9936020	9940580	history was changing you know with that with that very same blow you never
9940580	9944740	thought that we would go all the way from feature phones to high-end you know
9944740	9947980	two smartphones that people could buy for the same price as they were paying
9947980	9951660	for those shitty phones four years ago I gotta say though I I kind of feel bad
9951660	9954580	for that new guy that came in and stepped in as CEO I mean I know Steve
9954580	9958060	Jobs hand-picked him and I'm sure he's fine he's been he's probably really been
9958060	9960900	doing a lot more of the work for the past couple years but if you think about
9960900	9965660	it okay his first big press conference is about the iPhone 4s which is really
9965660	9969260	yeah yeah that was shocking I mean it was the fact that they couldn't even
9969260	9973900	like announce something greater than the iPhone 4 here's the problem I mean it is
9973900	9976900	what it is if Jobs has still been around that would have been his announcement to
9976900	9981060	make it I know but but think about this he knew Tim Cook had to know when he was
9981060	9987100	up on that stage that the former CEO was I mean he knew I'm sure he knew the
9987100	9991540	Steve Jobs was about to die well we actually well that was already known the
9991540	9995380	day he stepped down and that was like you know that was months ago I'm talking
9995380	10003860	the day tomorrow but the idea is that you know he said he paved the way in the
10003860	10009460	in the fact that he that you know mobile mobile gaming has like explode in the
10009460	10013900	past four to five years used to be a small niche market that only folks who
10013900	10018300	had the money to to pay for those shitty you know games for for those devices
10018300	10022180	back then but now it's like the quality is getting to the point where it might
10022180	10027460	even rival whatever Sony and Nintendo is actually spitting out I mean if you look
10027460	10031700	at the fact that these phones are like it's cheaper than the than the Vita
10031700	10036180	itself that they start cheaper than the Vita and they had just about this you
10036180	10040660	know just about the same number of games and the fact that the quality is damn
10040660	10045980	near almost ps2 level first you know for for a device that you know no greater
10045980	10050580	than four inches yeah that's pretty impressive hey hey hey hey all right all
10050580	10054740	right Zach we're gonna let you go so we wrap up but um thank you for your call
10054740	10059700	yeah anytime take care buddy all right I know he was definitely impacted by that
10059700	10062780	because you know if you listen to show before Zach was called in before and he
10062780	10067020	does work with mobile gaming and definitely we've seen more intervention
10067020	10070700	come out of the mobile world from Apple than anywhere really I think and
10070700	10075780	definitely not from Nokia all right that's gonna do it for calls tonight
10075780	10078340	sorry to those that didn't get through it but be sure to send us an email for
10078340	10082220	next week mailbag at orange laundry new calm or you could always send us a tweet
10082220	10087260	twitter.com slash OLR um I want to quickly quickly read one more tweet here
10087260	10092100	from Tiger Claw cuz I didn't get to this he sent a story from gamasutra about
10092100	10096060	this is kind of a longer article but I guess the headline is game developer
10096060	10102300	conference online web wise kids team for game promoting online child safety so
10102300	10106220	web wise kids is the game or no as the company then I guess they're just
10106220	10110200	promoting children being safe online I would assume like not sharing over
10110200	10114580	sharing personal details and so forth I there is a free title that's saying is
10114580	10118100	out there it's called passing the ball and it's an action game that follows a
10118100	10121700	parent and their child as they learn an important lesson about working together
10121700	10126540	I guess that it would be passing a ball which to me sounds a lot like you jump
10126540	10134860	to a conclusion somebody will get the reference all right the reference all
10134860	10138900	right thank you there is a donation link within passing the ball so you can make
10138900	10143120	a donation to web wise kids and they will be doing something with the game
10143120	10147380	developers conference event in San Francisco the initiative will include a
10147380	10153200	one-day gamers for change event created by the same nonprofit team in addition
10153200	10156180	to commissioning the game for web wide kids and adding the donate link to the
10156180	10162700	game $1,000 was directly donated to this network to help the programs to promote
10162700	10166660	a culture of safety responsibility and respect for youth and families in the
10166660	10172260	digital world again watch your damn kids and make sure if they have a Facebook a
10172260	10177320	they ought to be at least like 13 or 14 but B if they aren't you're monitoring
10177320	10180540	it you know exactly what they're doing I have heard a really young permanently
10180540	10183900	blind them I have well I have heard about really young kids with Facebook
10183900	10187820	accounts mostly to play the games which is fine as long as the parent is kind of
10187820	10191300	you know has watching out the corner of their eye you know what they're doing
10191300	10196380	although I think standing there looking over their shoulder well yes and no I
10196380	10199760	mean you can't put the child on it I mean at the at the end of the day it's
10199760	10203740	up to the parent that's fine but I think and sometimes you should sit there and
10203740	10206820	want to play the game with them but maybe there's times where you you kind
10206820	10210060	of get it loaded for them and then you can walk away for a couple minutes give
10210060	10213140	that child a sense of safety whatever make sure that when you walk back that's
10213140	10219340	what they're still doing you know porn friends wanna porn Ville not porn Ville
10219340	10225860	forget it all right there you go that's gonna do it for another week here at
10225860	10229860	Orange Lounge Radio oh but I did miss one little little thing we got to do thank
10229860	10232780	you Loki for pointing this out I totally missed this earlier what can I say I'm
10232780	10237820	out of practice so it's time for the FUs of the week
10237820	10260140	if you to people who don't do their damn part that's it fucking my crappy crappy
10260140	10267140	crappy very very crappy firewall at work that doesn't allow us to play live very
10267140	10273620	well because of our strict NAT settings and it's funny our I you know our IT guy
10273620	10280580	actually opened the NAT ports for my system made it worse so that's great
10280580	10283300	unfortunately they're gonna be installing a new firewall in a couple
10283300	10287340	weeks and if that doesn't work he's gonna put our systems outside the
10287340	10293980	firewall so that hopefully that won't be a problem all right a few to headaches
10293980	10297340	I've been getting some huge ones today and it's just it's not been good I'm
10297340	10302980	very sad but I did really wear myself out yesterday so that could be like part
10302980	10309460	of the reason why so I don't know that's it for that fuse of the week now we can
10309460	10314140	start to wrap up the show actually I got to ask Loki do you have any email last
10314140	10319340	minute last minute stories for us no I'm not gonna look anything up fine then
10319340	10322460	we'll go around and get everybody's final thought Loki will start with you
10322460	10329020	my final thought is opening our opening on the 12th will be voting for the
10329020	10333540	podcast awards so don't forget to vote every day every single day tell your
10333540	10340060	friends tell your enemies just make sure you vote every single day and especially

10370980	10374780	it's part of the reason that we we were hoping we'd get nominated for the
10374780	10379100	podcast award is because it's great exposure and you know we can't we don't
