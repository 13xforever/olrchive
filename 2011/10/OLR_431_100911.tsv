60530	61631	DarkSakura, Jamie Summers
85430	87471	You know, it's almost as if you never left.
87651	88991	We had such a derpy.
89111	91052	I heard about the derp-isodes while I was gone.
91072	92292	Yes, we called them derp-isodes.
92372	101716	I haven't heard, just like the podcast listeners, which I apologize for in advance, I haven't heard last week's, but I heard about half of the one from two weeks ago on my commute to work.
102696	105657	The one from two weeks ago was like two minutes?
106117	107778	Yeah, you guys just flew through the news.
107998	110639	And I did like a bajillion hours of Pump Up the Volume.
111362	125564	Not tonight though, we have a huge show tonight We have big announcements, big stuff to talk about tonight Of course I have to introduce the other guy here on the show Say hello to Techmaster Loki And I'll have you know for the record, I'm always questionable What?
126488	127828	I can't wait to hear your last week's show
146093	147174	I've been extremely busy.
147615	149036	Now, I know what you're going to think, though.
149156	150998	Like, yeah, the reason why I miss the shows.
151438	153320	I went to a rock concert two weeks ago.
153420	156423	Look, it's a band I've missed like three times.
156924	160007	And I said, I am seeing Lady Tron this time come hell or high water.
160067	160687	And it rocked.
161989	162849	But they only want you when you're 17.
163450	165592	And then last week, when you're 21, you're no fun.
166092	167213	Last week I went to Disneyland.
167313	168354	I know, rough life, right?
168715	171097	But I came back to just craziness at work.
171677	176001	And I had this performance I was doing last night.
176181	179264	I participated in a local production of Repo the Genetic Opera.
180105	180805	Yes, the movie.
180905	183287	They do shadow casting for that now, a la Rocky Horror.
183808	188452	Which, as you guys may or may not know, Rocky Horror is kind of the reason I got into podcasting in the first place.
188472	190494	Because Rocky Horror led to Under Sedation Live.
190834	191114	DarkSakura.com
212867	224903	and it was a great show man when they did some of like the killing scenes they did that whole thing where like the blood sprays out in the audience over the first five rows it was awesome so big kudos to the folks here in SAC that made that happen
225801	227141	And my friend played Blind Mag.
228022	229902	Yes, she was phenomenal.
230102	230802	She's really good.
230822	231643	Oh my gosh, I loved her.
231683	234223	She was, as they would say, fierce.
234503	235503	I didn't get to go last night.
235543	239004	I wanted to, but she has that dramatic quality in life.
240185	243465	And I don't want to ruin the movie too much, but it's been out a few years now.
243505	249107	She has a pretty dramatic death scene that's very over the top and just awesome to watch.
249587	251687	So, anyhow.
251807	253328	Only good role Sarah Silverman's ever done.
254875	255496	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
276053	276794	Hater in it.
276954	278055	Hater, hater, hater, hater.
278616	281759	But she was really, really good as Blind Mag.
281979	282980	Yes, I agree.
284061	293630	And to bring this back to games, Repo, even though some people don't really like it as a movie and say it's a terrible movie because it is a little weird.
293930	296072	It's the guy who did Saw doing a rock opera.
296773	298755	And like opera, meaning everything is sung.
299475	300075	Tony Head.
300536	301396	Anthony Stewart Head.
301896	302236	Hello.
302736	305918	And it's told in that kind of comic book style and it's just neat.
306058	306758	It's something you should see.
307418	307699	Anyhow.
308479	309419	And they should make a game out of it.
310320	311600	Back to video games for a minute.
312841	315862	Obviously this has been like everywhere this week but we have to mention it.
315902	316342	We have to.
317103	319604	Steve Jobs passed away this week and it's kind of one of those things.
320204	321184	It's insanely sad.
322025	326166	I know it's been all over CNN and especially all over Twitter and Facebook and so forth.
326186	327587	I know you guys have heard a lot about it but
327987	328648	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
343966	372603	and plus you know it was called podcasting in the beginning even before iTunes because and we were actually doing a show back before iTunes that's how long the show's been going on your old RSS would kind of you could get these programs that would actually still sync them to your iPod because they weren't iPhones back then but iPods and you kind of sync it that way and so there were ways to do what iTunes was doing before that but it was always designed with that portable on the go thing in mind
373443	373963	In a garage.
392832	395054	The original was in the garage.
395134	401057	Obviously, that leads to Apple II, which is what anybody who grew up in the 80s, we all did.
401137	405940	How many of us played Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego on one of those rectangular bricks?
405980	409482	Or Oregon Trail, or Math Blasters.
409502	412224	That was a huge part of our education.
412284	417727	To me, it was always really looking forward to computer lab day.
418507	420828	I'm sure you other nerds feel the same way, right?
420888	424650	It was just like Computer Lab Day was awesome We didn't have computers in Alabama Really?
424830	440136	Oh No, we had like I actually believed you for a minute We actually had one Apple IIe in the library Which I would just go play all the time And then we had like the tall brick Macs, you know what I mean?
440516	445938	Right At a couple of the facilities that I used to do volunteer work at
446580	454426	And if it wasn't for him, we wouldn't have the MacBook and we wouldn't have been able to upload the virus to the alien mothership to save the world on Independence Day.
454926	456267	Absolutely, absolutely.
456508	461571	Very important contribution is that Steve Jobs did contribute to saving us from virus.
462152	463313	But I'll tell you something.
463813	469697	Even back in the day, the first really good graphics programs were developed on Mac.
470758	471919	And that's why, I mean...
472319	473680	Max were in schools everywhere.
474461	480044	Especially when you and I were growing up and Loki, Max were everywhere in our schools.
480184	484587	That was a really smart ploy on Apple's part, but certainly you get attached to it.
485188	488670	I was in yearbook, which I know is something very similar to what you do now.
488830	490371	You might not do yearbook, but you do publishing.
490731	493333	Dude, we did that shit on PageMaker on a Mac.
493513	494674	It was good times.
495415	496876	Now we're like, did you use PageMaker?
497616	498517	InDesign, hello.
499217	500218	But yeah, but Adobe...
501699	508243	You know, even fully supported the Mac platform for ages until they finally realized, oh yeah, PC's caught up.
508363	508644	Oops.
509885	513247	And, you know, there was also the gaming connection too on the 2600.
513687	516949	Jobs had played a role in Breakout on the Atari 2600.
517970	544696	that's one of the more kind of I mean Woz you know talked about how he kind of got shafted on the Atari bonus on that game but regardless of you know all that and how things went down it's you know he did kind of have that more direct impact on the gaming industry and I gotta say this you guys this is the one that people forget about I think or not everybody but you know some people have forgot about CNN stuff I think is the most important in some ways things he did he brought Pixar back and like Pixar
545956	546677	is amazing.
546757	548298	Like, the movies they make and everything.
548358	554043	Like, if you hate every single Pixar movie that's ever been made, I question your taste.
554103	555064	I'm sorry to say.
555444	559407	But, like, you know, and Pixar has made some that you may not like.
559467	562090	Like, I know not everybody dug Cars 2 or Ratatouille.
562130	562990	Or A Bug's Life.
563070	568875	Okay, but seriously, like, Wall-E, Up, Toy Story 1, 2, or 3, take your pick.
568915	571297	How often does a movie like that have so many great sequels?
571698	571978	Right?
572939	573099	So...
573639	578866	I do have to say though, most CG movies today are made in Linux based programs.
592262	596125	There's still some today that kind of feel that traditional animation is best.
596605	600067	I think we're getting to a place where you get a good mix of the two.
600387	602268	There's been some great traditionally animated ones.
602308	603909	I like Princess and the Frog an awful lot.
604470	605971	Boo!
606511	606671	What?
606691	607412	You don't like that movie?
607512	608072	It was terrible.
608332	608952	I haven't seen it.
609013	611194	I thought it was great.
611214	611834	Hater.
611954	615717	Obviously the stuff Pixar does, even up through Tangled, were really, really good movies.
615997	617658	I know Tangled was not technically Pixar, but...
619098	646125	I mean you look at DreamWorks look at any of them I mean basically Pixar really innovated the genre so yeah a tip of the hat to a guy who was very sassy too like in the way he ran his company was very unlike other CEOs so a tip of the hat to Steve Jobs and rest in peace sadly I think we all kind of I mean when it happened it was like oh wow but I think we all kind of we all kind of knew
646565	647246	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
664517	665638	Pancreas Pancreas Pancreas
685599	695104	and it's no joke and I was very scared there for a minute when they had to do the MRI on it because they told me flat out they had to rule out pancreatic cancer because I had a growth on my pancreas.
695324	697346	Thank heavens it was just a cyst.
697866	701788	So, you know, I absolutely feel and I know it had to be a great deal of pain.
701808	703069	And now it's been stopped and desisted.
703769	706911	Well, in his case, you know... I meant for you.
707111	707531	Oh, for me?
707611	708452	Stopped and desisted.
709832	710293	Oh, I get it.
710313	711093	Desisted.
711113	711693	Har, har.
712154	713835	But no, at least for him, he's not in pain anymore.
714075	717657	And, you know, you gotta imagine, like, he was up on the stage as late as, what, April?
717957	720118	He did that... It was the Stanford thing, too.
720138	721599	No, that was back in like, oh, five.
721899	723760	But April was the whole iCloud thing.
723820	724080	Yeah.
724140	726141	And so, you know, he was on stage for that.
726341	729943	So when you consider that was six months before he ultimately passed away...
732165	739768	I'm just glad he's not in pain anymore and I hope his family and all that is doing okay.
740469	741889	I'm just going to turn the car, complete 180.
742070	745351	I'm going to go from really, really sad news to really happy news.
746031	746792	I'm turning the car around.
747092	748433	Now we're going to Disneyland, everybody.
751974	757997	We mentioned a couple weeks ago on the show that we would really appreciate it if you guys would nominate us for the podcast award, which we won back in 2005.
759639	774259	I don't even think we've been nominated since, maybe like one time, I don't remember, but it's mostly been, especially in those first couple years, 06, 07, a lot of like the corporate cast, and you know, a nomination in there would go a long way towards exposure for the show and everything, and
774759	775840	Oh my god, we got nominated!
776220	776560	We did!
776820	777721	It was announced yesterday.
777841	778581	We got nominated!
778941	780862	PodcastWords.com if you want to check it out.
781302	782063	It's amazing.
782883	791208	And what's really amazing, I'm going to be honest, the other shows that are nominated, I think all but one or maybe two of them are indie shows.
791228	792148	You're talking like ten shows.
792548	794089	And there's some awesome indie shows in there.
794990	799692	And so I feel very confident that some indie is going to walk away with it.
800613	801253	And that's great.
801873	803354	You know, and Indy's going to be getting the exposure.
803494	805475	Although I'd rather be our Indy.
806615	808136	Well, sure, not going to lie.
808156	809857	It would be awfully nice.
809877	812358	No, I want us to be nominated just to lose.
813138	818641	It would be awfully nice, but... If you don't vote for us, we'll eat wet cigarette butts.
820522	840434	Don't care We'll throw a protest No, obviously we would love a vote And voting opens on the 12th at podcastawards.com It's this interesting thing where you have to vote every day So please vote often And yeah, we would really appreciate it That would be great But win or lose, we're going to just keep doing what we always do, right kids?
840674	847718	Yeah, being awesome I'm going to quit if we lose I'm done, stomp Alright
848975	851898	Let's move on and talk about, we gotta get back to video games.
852258	857022	Let's talk about our gaming weeks and the stuff that we have been playing this week.
857142	858223	So DarkSakura, we'll start with you.
858363	859044	How was your gaming week?
859184	860525	I really haven't played much of anything.
860765	863167	I mean, just because I've been super busy with school.
863968	865149	Excuses, excuses.
865489	869332	I was on WoW just long enough to do dailies and that's it, really.
869352	875418	I mean, I did like one instance and, you know, but like yesterday was Yom Kippur.
876098	876699	Yom Kippur
891129	892470	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
911381	929322	but I mean it's it's but for me it was just sort of like stepping away from everything you know I turned off my phone I turned off my computer you know I and yeah the fasting thing is never fun but I spent a lot more time around people
930855	934317	I gotta say, you know, my friends, some of my friends and I used to do a trip.
934397	935337	Sadly, we don't do it anymore.
935377	943061	We used to do a trip every year to Mendocino and we would stay in a house that was quote unquote off the grid because you literally don't have cell service when you're that close to the ocean.
943622	946863	And, you know, just it was actually a really neat, neat trip.
946883	950685	And it forced me to get away from all that and just be with people, which was which was great.
951025	958669	So I have to say that actually it's been a good week of disconnecting from from the games and the Internet.
958849	962452	So your gaming week has consisted of being anti-technology.
963714	964494	It was a vacation.
964634	965375	It was a vacation.
965695	967737	And then I found a game that I totally have to have.
968378	971481	And that's that Kirby 10 Kirby game.
973788	978652	Kirby's broken up into 10 parts and you have to find all of his parts and then you attack things by throwing a bunch of Kirbys at it.
979412	979952	I want that game.
980953	981493	Mass Attack.
981534	981794	That's it.
981834	982354	I want that game.
982854	983335	Go get it.
983895	984455	I'm broke.
985936	994122	I will fill in for your gaming week then since you were on a religious observance and so forth through the week with what some folks in chat have been playing.
995163	998965	YYR in our chatroom says, I bought a Turbo Duo with 11 games.
999465	1001027	Not that I have much to explain or anything.
1001567	1002648	Because this show is rated TG-16.
1005810	1012875	Entitalitis, hope I said that right, said My Gaming Week, Street Fighter 3, Third Strike Online, bought DJ Hero 2 on a whim at Big Lots.
1012955	1017598	Well, if they were selling it at Big Lots, that means it was probably $10, hence why he probably got it on a whim.
1018039	1018579	So, awesome.
1018599	1019139	It's a good whim.
1019420	1019920	It's a good whim.
1020200	1022641	I think DJ Hero is a pretty underrated series.
1022661	1023301	It's a lot of fun.
1023581	1026662	It's unfortunately like the other music games that I played.
1028203	1028943	I buy it.
1029043	1029903	I get all excited about it.
1030143	1033364	Play it a little bit and then it goes away for a while.
1033524	1037506	But then eventually once I have nothing to do, I'll go back and play it again.
1038326	1041088	It didn't have fabulous longevity.
1041128	1046271	And I think the fact that it has such a large controller that you have to kind of like put away, then get out, plug in.
1046311	1050754	I think honestly, when people want to play, sometimes they just want to turn on the system and go.
1051314	1051995	So I don't know.
1053335	1055397	But yeah, DJ Hero at least was a great game.
1056177	1057338	All right, Loki, how was your gaming week?
1057705	1058265	It was pretty good.
1058325	1059446	I played a few things.
1061266	1066088	Grand Theft Auto, barely, because our firewall has been absolute shit.
1066448	1077111	Apparently Microsoft went down, Live went down for a little bit on Monday, and for some reason after that, our firewall has just been absolute shit.
1077191	1084794	We were lucky to get four out of the five consoles connected to Live in a game together and actually be able to stay in.
1084834	1085954	It has been more of like
1086674	1087695	Dead Rising 2 Off The Record
1111152	1115136	Which I was really excited about that and it's a pretty awesome game.
1116778	1127248	The only disappointment I have with the game is Dead Rising 2, one of the things I hated was the fact that you had to keep going back to give your stupid daughter Zombrex.
1128143	1135044	I was like, cool, Dead Rising 2 off the record is going to be awesome because you don't have to do that anymore.
1135904	1141165	No, this time Frank West is infected and he needs to take Zombrex.
1141245	1144226	So I was like, oh, come on.
1144626	1149687	Thankfully, when I did that, when I got to that point, I was like, oh, come on.
1150167	1153427	I switched right over to sandbox mode and there's none of that shit.
1153588	1156088	So it's just killing zombies and that's it.
1156528	1161109	Funny enough, the way the beginning of that... Is this game already out or is it coming out?
1161229	1161669	It's coming out.
1161849	1162109	Okay.
1163170	1168891	So the way it kind of begins in the sandbox mode, he's being dropped out of a helicopter, much like the first game.
1169251	1171072	And they're all, so are you covering your next big scoop here?
1171112	1173112	He's all, no, not this time.
1173452	1175493	This is my vacation!
1175633	1178894	And does a roll onto the roof and then just starts killing zombies.
1179374	1183795	But everything transfers back and forth, your experience and costumes and crap that you get.
1184255	1194061	So right now I went through a sex shop, so I had a bunch of weird village people-esque stuff on.
1194081	1198664	You know, when I think of the village people, I don't necessarily think of sex.
1198944	1201266	Well, chaps, okay.
1201346	1202747	Maybe it's a generation thing.
1202907	1204848	No, it's more like leather chaps.
1205413	1205793	Alright.
1206773	1207854	Just for whatever reason.
1207874	1209394	I'm just picking up all the clothes on the way.
1209454	1211435	Whatever ends up happening, that's fine.
1211455	1212315	Because it's shopping.
1212935	1215696	But now I have this weird mask and bullhorns on my head.
1215756	1221338	Not gonna lie, I always got the biggest kick out of playing a furry in Dead Rising and putting on the big furry costume.
1221778	1222559	I haven't gotten there yet.
1223079	1224620	But it's pretty fun.
1226242	1227703	Yes, I'm a furry, virtually.
1228664	1233828	But it's nice to be able to do the photography stuff.
1234708	1244016	Frank, even in the main story mission, which I'll probably go back to that, it's still pretty funny because the dialogue and stuff is a little bit different.
1244036	1247259	But a lot of the stuff that happens in the game is kind of similar.
1248099	1248440	I don't know.
1248580	1250862	It'll be interesting to see how the game plays out.
1252091	1256592	But yeah, so I'd recommend picking up, especially since it's not even a full price game, it's just $40.
1256632	1260314	Holy!
1260614	1263335	It's like Dead Rising 2, but better, so yeah.
1263355	1267456	It's priced where most games ought to be, in my opinion, but anyway.
1267856	1270617	Yeah, so definitely worth picking up.
1271963	1273384	That's pretty much all I've played this week.
1273804	1274164	All right.
1274905	1276906	Well, hey, let's go to my game of the week.
1276926	1277507	Oh, no, I'm sorry.
1277807	1278147	Burnout.
1278667	1279168	No, I'm sorry.
1279568	1279968	One last thing.
1280228	1280929	Burnout Crash.
1280989	1282590	Played that a little bit, and that's actually pretty fun.
1283070	1287133	Despite the fact that I really hated the idea of a top-down Burnout, but it's actually a pretty fun game.
1288010	1288910	Alright, you done?
1289310	1289570	I'm done.
1289650	1289951	You sure?
1290371	1292791	Yeah.
1293091	1296952	So I haven't played a whole lot of games, especially this week.
1296972	1298353	I already told you guys I've been busy as hell.
1299373	1307295	So, you know, besides the Disneyland games, because you know whenever I go to Disneyland I gotta go to Flynn's Arcade because Electronica was back and play some classic games there.
1307335	1308436	They did mix them up a little bit.
1308476	1311897	I noticed some games were gone, but I play stuff like Frogger that's always there.
1313377	1317258	And I also, you know, of course Midway Mania, which is a lot of fun.
1318140	1318721	GamePricing.com
1339040	1355171	and that is where you basically pay what you want for the game Frozen Synapse and it comes with the game Spacechem as well and if you're not familiar with Humble Bundle they just had one of these like not even a month or two ago because I remember that's how I got VVVVVVV
1356251	1357392	was in one of these Humble Bundles.
1357512	1365176	It's a very interesting new way to price games where people can kind of pay what they want.
1365236	1372460	And these games are not necessarily new, but they're good games.
1373040	1379063	And I think something a lot of people may not have given another look if they didn't have this whole pay what you want thing going on.
1379783	1381564	And I think they're making pretty good money off of it.
1381844	1383924	And a chunk of it goes to charity, which I think is great.
1383984	1385465	And it's not just Spacechem either.
1385545	1387465	You do get a bunch of other free stuff.
1387485	1387865	Well, hold on.
1387885	1388545	I want to put this out.
1388585	1394587	So if you spend more than the average, which right now is $4.75, you get some other games as well.
1394967	1396467	You get Shadowgrounds.
1396487	1398148	You get Shadowground Survivor.
1398668	1402449	I think these other games were only with pre-order.
1402469	1403549	I don't think you get them anymore.
1404025	1411270	you get the game Trauma now too I think it's thrown in there and the one other game I want to mention because this is the one I played, Trine was in the bundle as well
1412404	1414186	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1435748	1436208	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1452695	1475427	and you literally hit one button to switch between because like the story kind of goes that all three of them find this magical item that they get attached to because usually the thief and the warrior would not be getting along and the mage and the thief would be having this weird thing going on so you know the item binds them all together and so now their souls are all shared or whatever so they're going on this adventure to remedy that.
1476027	1479129	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1499444	1503047	For the low, low price of whatever, it's great.
1503968	1506609	But again, I would recommend you not be totally cheap.
1506730	1510753	Spend the, let's just say, five bucks at least and get the other games as well.
1510793	1512334	And if you're having a good week, give them ten.
1512394	1513034	It's a good cause.
1513695	1516677	Or whatever you think these games are worth.
1516957	1535994	So yeah, that's at HumbleBundle.com And trying alone was worth it I gotta admit, I tried I was gifted a copy of Frozen Synapse about two weeks ago Because Steam was having like a buy one get one free sale Where like people could give the codes to other people And somebody was kind enough to give me their code for Frozen Synapse I gotta admit
1536714	1538114	I didn't get it at all.
1538814	1540395	I think I just need to try again.
1541135	1542695	Sometimes you have to be in the right mindset.
1542975	1543935	Have you guys ever had that?
1544115	1546436	You have to just be in the right mindset to enjoy a game.
1546936	1549216	Sometimes you'll sit down and play it once and you're like, I don't get it.
1549656	1553417	But then you go back a month later and play it again and you're like, oh man, what was I missing?
1553457	1559778	I think I just wasn't in the right mindset, which is why I don't think I ever reviewed it on the show because I knew I wasn't really prepared to talk about it.
1560118	1562079	Oh, did DarkSakura just buy the Humble Bundle?
1562339	1562779	Yes, it did.
1563079	1563619	Alright.
1564379	1566021	I think you'll like trying.
1566181	1570825	I'm not going to buy this one because I haven't even played through more than one game out of the last bundle I bought.
1570865	1573848	But didn't you play VVVVVV until you beat it?
1575549	1586519	Yes, until I beat it, but not 100% because I still have one more shiny object to get and I just want to rip my hair out if I'm supposed to get that.
1588021	1588441	It's annoying.
1589622	1590262	I mean, I get it.
1590362	1595566	It's supposed to be hard, but I don't want to play it anymore because it's so hard.
1596987	1600049	I'm not going to come back to it and try it because I know what happens if I get it.
1600229	1601950	It just flips the damn game upside down.
1601990	1602390	Spoiler.
1602871	1603891	And you play the same thing again.
1604211	1607354	No, it's still the same fucking game because you flip up and down.
1607434	1608534	It's not like Castlevania.
1608795	1614758	I'm sorry, but I get what you're saying, but up until you get to that point, it's an amazing game, and the music is amazing.
1614778	1615779	No, it's an amazing game.
1615819	1616119	I love it.
1616139	1617180	It's such a simple concept.
1617260	1617821	It's just great.
1619362	1621103	I mean... I know, alright, alright.
1621824	1624626	But anyway, I think, you know, maybe... Loki, did you play Trine on 360?
1625287	1627469	Because I think a lot of people may have already played it and I just missed it.
1627489	1628029	I haven't played it on 360.
1628129	1633294	I would say that alone makes this set worth it, but, you know, check it out.
1633354	1635596	Frozen Synapse, I think, is a bit more of like a strategy game.
1635796	1637657	Also comes with soundtracks and an editor.
1638438	1638798	Oh, really?
1638838	1639739	I didn't even pick that up.
1640840	1641801	See, I just... You know what?
1641901	1644183	I just picked up my Steam code and went to town.
1645376	1646376	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1670147	1687772	it is a really good looking game and very smooth on my computer and I'm playing it in like 1680 by 1050 widescreen in high quality so it's great yeah actually Salacious Pop may not even know I didn't even have the graphics on their highest setting I had it on high not very high so maybe I'll have to try again later with a very high
1688652	1690453	So anyway, that's pretty much my gaming week.
1690814	1696198	So I think we will move on to gaming news and talk about all that with you guys in our chat room.
1697159	1701022	I guess I could quickly mention once again, please follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.
1701342	1704264	We also have a Facebook at facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
1704605	1709288	This is also the part of the show where I will mention any housekeeping, like upcoming shows that we're missing and what have you.
1710569	1711850	I'm stuck for the rest of the year.
1711890	1713832	I don't see myself missing any shows.
1713892	1715233	Something unforeseen may always come up.
1715433	1716474	I'm missing one in a few weeks.
1716494	1719819	That's right, DarkSakura, you are leaving for a week at the end of the month, right?
1720159	1721721	I will be gone on the 23rd.
1721921	1722842	But it won't affect the show.
1722882	1726026	We will have a guest host just like you guys had Dan here when I wasn't here.
1726627	1727748	And we'll move on.
1728529	1729431	So, all right.
1730572	1731633	Let's get into some gaming news.
1731713	1732595	Loki, start us off.
1732635	1732915	What's up?
1733155	1742119	So, PlayStation 2 games, as we've kind of thought for a while, are going digital in this new Only on PlayStation Network campaign.
1743120	1756286	They're going to be doing, I guess every Tuesday this month, they're going to have a new exclusive selection of rare classic games, including God Hand, Grim Grimoire, Maximo and Odin Sphere, and Ring of Red.
1759588	1764171	And I guess, of course, their old PlayStation 2 games, they've done nothing to them.
1764291	1765872	No updates whatsoever.
1765932	1768393	They just play now on the PlayStation 3.
1769614	1777978	And I guess PlayStation Plus members get them at a 20% off discount during launch week.
1779079	1784202	And if you spend more than $60 in October, you'll get a $10 credit for November.
1786411	1788893	So, interesting.
1789033	1792756	I guess they're saying there's also a lineup of PlayStation Network exclusives.
1792956	1804065	Now, these aren't necessarily, these are actually not PlayStation 2 games, but Euphoria and Rock Hard, that was actually this week on the 4th.
1804706	1809930	Next week on the 11th, Sideway New York on the 13th, Sodium Collection.
1811572	1814496	If it's sodium, might as well forget about it.
1814776	1818641	18th, Okabu and Rocket Birds.
1819042	1825731	And then on the 25th, the expansion for Infamous 2, Infamous Festival, Blood, and PixelJunk Side Scroller.
1827012	1830013	But all I got to say is, yeah, thanks, Sony.
1830273	1842037	You figured out a way to play PlayStation 2 games on your PS3 systems, but you don't do a free update for everybody so they can, I don't know, take their old games that they have and make everybody happy because they have backwards compatibility.
1842277	1844218	No, you decide to sell them on the marketplace.
1845038	1845378	Figures.
1847621	1847981	I'm trying
1875615	1876676	Have they emulated that?
1906155	1907016	Well, here's my other question.
1907056	1919183	Okay, the whole benefit of the doubt thing is it may be a situation similar to Xbox 360 and original Xbox, or maybe their emulator doesn't emulate everything, and that's why they don't want to open it up, because maybe it can't play the big, big games.
1919543	1924286	Like, I mean, you got a lot of neat games in this original launch here, but let's be real.
1924346	1928468	It's not like you have your Final Fantasy X, your Grand Theft Auto Vice City.
1928488	1929929	Well, yeah, they're doing... None of that is in there.
1929969	1932911	But see, they're doing just rare...
1933211	1933772	DarkSakura.com
1967213	1972237	It's because they lost a lot of money when the PlayStation Network went down and they need to recoup that.
1972838	1973979	That's why they're selling them.
1974019	1974439	You think?
1974639	1976000	That is exactly why they're doing it.
1976040	1979023	I did notice that there was very little fanfare about this.
1979103	1979824	You know what I mean?
1980204	1981545	We've been building up to this.
1981645	1986309	Remember about two years ago there were the whole rumors about the Dreamcast things are going to be coming?
1987030	1987330	I don't know.
1987350	1988190	But those already have.
1989171	1989251	E3 E3
2007066	2008627	or even Tokyo Game Show about this.
2008667	2012090	But no, this just was like, no, yeah, we're going to just put these up in the marketplace.
2012130	2012310	Enjoy.
2012330	2021196	Well, that's why you're seeing a lot of these older games that are very niche and stuff because these companies aren't going to necessarily put out these HD remakes or whatever of their old games.
2021616	2025939	So obviously you're not going to find a Grand Theft Auto or something like that as part of this because...
2027240	2032884	As we discussed last week, of course they're going to at some point up-res all the Grand Theft Auto games and put it out on a disc.
2033304	2036046	I mean, it's just stupid if they don't.
2036266	2037567	I mean, why wouldn't you?
2037587	2040448	Especially if San Andreas, it would be easy.
2040568	2042990	All you would have to do is re-license the music in there.
2043110	2045231	Obviously, that would be a cost.
2045371	2051035	You wouldn't even necessarily have to re-record the audio in the game.
2051095	2054117	Obviously, you'd have to get the rights from all the voice actors and stuff like that.
2054637	2062844	But, you know, if you put in the Rage Engine or something like that, and they've already done that on the PC, modders have already taken care of that, it could be done.
2063504	2067407	It's just getting all the rights and all the legal stuff taken care of.
2067968	2070730	But once they do that, I mean, it's just going to be amazing.
2071090	2074053	I'm going to our chat room for some comments at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
2074473	2074793	SSJ100Matt says,
2079897	2108472	YYR says maybe they're just doing software emulation wasn't there a Playstation 3 model that did that already although it didn't support every game I seem to remember that too wasn't it the Europe one or maybe they had one here too but wasn't there one overseas the old 80 gig systems that came out here a long time ago 80 and the 40 I think it was the 80 gig systems like the Metal Gear Solid one was one of the first ones that supported just some of the titles and not all of them like the one sitting in my front room
2108994	2134763	And then the 40 gig systems stopped supporting it And eventually the 80 gig systems also stopped supporting it But yeah, it is software emulation So is the PlayStation 1 games And in fact, the PlayStation 1 games You can take that emulator and basically dump any ISO into it And it'll work just fine That's what they've done on hacked PSPs Is they've taken that same emulator and you can run any PlayStation 1 game
2135363	2145549	and I'm guessing this is probably the same situation with the PlayStation 2 stuff is it's just an emulator that they have and they've found a way to just basically they can dump any ISO in there and done.
2145989	2146609	They're ready to go.
2147470	2152252	I don't know because I haven't really seen anybody try to hack it apart yet but I'm guessing that's probably what it is.
2153173	2154854	Do you think they'll make a lot of money off this, Loki?
2155573	2156314	God Hand Clover Game
2171337	2173738	Yeah, I gotta admit, there's some of those that I kind of want to check out too.
2173758	2177661	But thankfully, Alan has like a couple of these already.
2177761	2179982	So it's just like, oh, we just gotta hook up the PlayStation 2.
2180022	2186185	It's sad though that they aren't even trying to like update these at all.
2186225	2190307	I mean, they're not even smoothing out the graphics or whatever that you would get.
2190508	2192369	I think you can do that with the PlayStation 3.
2192829	2196771	Well, shit, I haven't even tried to run a PlayStation 2 game on my 20 gig.
2196791	2197331	Well, 500 gig now.
2200713	2206977	I know you can do the smoothing stuff like kind of how you were able to with the PlayStation 2 on PlayStation 1 games.
2207417	2208478	It was a little bit better.
2210619	2211620	But yeah, I mean, it's just...
2213576	2214617	and DarkSakura.com.
2230144	2235728	Hell, you can't buy new copies of that anymore, so that might be a good way to drive sales.
2235769	2236969	And same with the PlayStation 1 games.
2237390	2245816	PS3s are fully backwards compatible with PlayStation 1 games, and I'm pretty sure they sell a lot of PlayStation 1 games on their network, so I don't understand why they don't do it.
2247739	2249300	If I may rewind just a little bit.
2249440	2249960	Sure, of course.
2251001	2256604	The game Splot that was a pre-order win, they are including it when it's available.
2257364	2257664	Oh, okay.
2257684	2258645	For the indie bundle.
2258925	2259125	Nice.
2259425	2260546	And there's a demo of it available.
2260846	2261246	Woohoo!
2262267	2262607	Good to know.
2263826	2264146	All right.
2264446	2265867	Well, let's move on with some other news.
2266287	2272888	This is also about Sony and a comment that they have made this week, and it's about the Vita, which a lot of people are looking forward to.
2272928	2274609	And I've got to say, I'm one of them.
2274829	2276409	I'm definitely picking up a Vita at launch.
2276529	2278049	Loki, you're getting one of these too, right?
2278149	2278410	Maybe.
2279390	2279730	Maybe.
2280230	2282030	What are you sitting on the fence with right now?
2282070	2285471	I know Dark Sakura has more financial stuff.
2285731	2286391	It's financial.
2286692	2286892	Is it?
2286972	2287372	Okay.
2287952	2288212	All right.
2288979	2291100	Well, it is a financial investment, I guess, no matter how you look at it.
2291120	2295842	I mean, I guess it's financial for me, too, but I have a real tendency to spend a lot of money on stupid crap.
2295942	2297282	The lineup is looking nice.
2297423	2300424	It's just we'll see what they have at launch.
2301284	2301504	All right.
2301704	2307727	Well, let's talk about a comment that John Kohler this week, who's the director of hardware marketing, mentioned in an interview with Investor Palace.
2308107	2308347	Quote,
2317731	2317931	Yeah, um...
2343843	2344523	I don't know about that.
2359470	2375362	and the fact that it's going to have still the touch sensor, you could pretty much, if you're a developer, you could port this stuff over to the PlayStation Suite or whatever and if it does end up turning out to be pretty viable, you could see a lot of stuff coming out of there and yeah, they could quickly catch up.
2376423	2379545	Beating out Apple right away, I don't know about that.
2379805	2384629	I mean, because they're not going to sell more units than there are iPhones or iPods or whatever, iPads.
2386049	2387390	Just like they're two tablets.
2387450	2388030	I mean, come on.
2389550	2390651	Those things are terrible looking.
2391671	2397833	I mean, come on.
2397853	2410917	I'm still looking forward to the Vita, and I think the intricacy of the games on here are not going to be able to... I mean, will be a step higher, certainly, than what you get on the iPhone and so forth, despite everything that iPhone showed this week.
2412738	2436768	but I think the other big thing that sets this apart is just the fact that it's designed as a gaming system first so therefore you have things like I don't know tangible buttons and sort of the features that gamers would want but of course this whole comment like this you know we're better than the mobile games and so forth I think just serves as justification for them to charge way more money for the games and how much weren't you saying the games were like 50 bucks on this thing right now
2437068	2438550	Yeah, that's what PSP games are.
2438630	2439871	I couldn't remember.
2439891	2441293	I always thought PSP was $40.
2441473	2446358	Well, PSP games are $40 now, but they used to be $50.
2446478	2450603	I mean, it's just now you're not seeing a lot of games sold on there.
2450963	2454828	But yeah, there's still $50 games on the PSP, and I think that's a great price point.
2454868	2458352	I mean, assuming that stays there and doesn't go any higher, because...
2459773	2460093	I don't know.
2460193	2461654	I don't think they should be.
2461714	2468518	But I like the fact, though, that the system is going to be very much like the original PSP where it's a gaming system, but it does a lot of other shit.
2469259	2469859	Right, right.
2470620	2475803	And I think that will be probably ultimately its greatest strength as well is that it's a great college kid system.
2476484	2478825	And I think that's probably where the PSP sold a lot, too.
2479566	2480166	So there you go.
2480826	2482968	All right, well, DarkSakura, what do you got for us?
2483405	2510739	I have some stuff and it's more Sony yay basically they've implied that all the first party titles are going to use the online pass basically they're pulling an EA like the $10 deal so they're saying that Uncharted 3 is going to use the online pass system that was introduced earlier with Resistance 3 and saying that online pass will be incorporated into future Sony Computer Entertainment Worldwide Studios games with online functionality
2512282	2513703	They said they're going to announce more on it later.
2514463	2516265	Well, now a first party's on board.
2516305	2518506	I think it's time to just accept that this is now the norm.
2518986	2519206	Yeah.
2519426	2519627	Right?
2519907	2520307	Pretty much.
2521067	2524369	There's still some people that are... I think you'll see a lot more third parties do it.
2524610	2525850	You're not going to see Microsoft do it.
2526451	2526871	They can't.
2527011	2528632	I mean, that would just look bad.
2528672	2529673	Microsoft can't do it.
2529693	2530073	You're right.
2530113	2530873	I agree with you there.
2531594	2533915	Unless they stop charging for gold, which they're not going to do.
2534275	2534436	No.
2534836	2534976	Yeah.
2535416	2538177	So it would be very interesting if they try, though.
2539318	2540578	I can't wait for that episode.
2541018	2542519	And Nintendo, well, you know.
2543460	2544840	They don't even know online exists.
2544860	2545560	What online?
2545961	2546641	Exactly.
2546901	2547621	That was funny.
2547641	2549642	It's like you have to charge for an online pass.
2550122	2550342	What?
2550523	2552183	There's online?
2552203	2554464	So we can maintain our online system.
2554764	2555044	What?
2556685	2557425	What online?
2558766	2559767	Who knows?
2560408	2566173	There's still a lot of question marks with the Wii U. Yeah, like what does it do?
2566753	2569676	Well, one of those huge question marks is how's it going to handle online?
2569696	2573960	And they have been purposefully quiet on it because I don't think they know either.
2574480	2576042	But they better know by June.
2576742	2578104	Like, crap.
2578944	2580506	We have to do online as well?
2581386	2583568	Our online system will be significant.
2584629	2585951	Significantly bad.
2586391	2595459	I told you at E3, right, when they brought the EA guy out on stage, I thought he was going to come out to announce that EA was going to just do the online part of the Wii.
2595499	2603125	Because they were talking about a partnership and stuff, and they mentioned online games and stuff, and I thought, oh, they're just going to let EA handle the online part of the Wii.
2603466	2604166	That'll be what it is.
2604787	2605648	No, that wasn't what it is.
2606408	2607769	That would be terrible if they did that.
2608390	2609411	And that would be sad.
2611249	2612369	Alright, moving on, Loki.
2613730	2615430	So, it's kind of cool.
2615710	2630514	During the same time as the whole Apple unveil of their new technology devices and stuff like that, there was this whole Flash Adobe conference, Adobe Max conference going on.
2631194	2633655	and some of the new things that they're showing.
2633995	2638676	First off, Unreal Engine support for Flash 11, which is kind of interesting.
2638816	2647838	You're going to actually have some really decent looking games now running in the Flash or even in your own web browser, so that's kind of cool.
2649279	2653800	People are saying, hey, maybe this could be a major transition in social gaming.
2654440	2655180	No, it won't.
2655240	2657521	I'm afraid that's not going to be the case because
2658081	2658842	You know what?
2659182	2670387	Yes, the technology may be out there to do that, but it doesn't necessarily mean that a company is going to do that, seeing as they can develop a game much cheaper that doesn't necessarily need the Unreal 3 engine.
2670928	2678051	But it's neat to see that, hey, someday we may be playing Unreal Tournament in our web browser.
2680953	2697879	And then, of course, not to be outdone by that, Crytek also is investigating Flash for the CryEngine and possibly doing some sort of cross-platform solution, including support with a bunch of other systems.
2698140	2700360	They're even saying maybe looking into iOS and Android.
2700380	2701001	That'd be kind of cool.
2701421	2706063	I don't know if that'd be able to... Obviously, not some of the phones out there like mine, but...
2708752	2709312	Very cool.
2709513	2713595	And, of course, they're saying Crytek Seal is hard to work at.
2713935	2718578	The first-person shooter, Warface, which is supposed to be coming out in Asian regions.
2719258	2721820	But it might be pretty cool.
2721840	2735288	If they do some sort of easy cross-platform solution, you may see a lot of these PC games being ported to many other devices other than just Xbox 360 and PS3 in the near future.
2735648	2735828	So...
2736949	2737590	That's cool.
2737970	2745358	It'll be interesting to see if web browsers actually get enough technology where they can support really good looking games.
2745819	2748742	That would be kind of interesting because then you wouldn't necessarily need
2750549	2750929	DarkSakura.com
2775325	2782027	I don't know if that would be... See, the problem is... I just shot my friend DarkSakura in the face.
2782527	2785848	Click here to post to your wall and try Unreal Gaming now.
2785888	2791209	The problem with that, though, is I just don't see them doing a casual game like that.
2791229	2799971	Because, once again, Facebook kind of tends to skew towards casual gamers, and I don't really see Unreal Tournament...
2800231	2801512	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2822192	2826435	And I was surprised to see the Powered by Unreal Technology logo at the beginning.
2826575	2833220	I realize the new game is, but I was like, well, what the hell about the classic emulation needs the fucking Unreal Engine?
2833280	2833980	Like, really?
2835001	2840524	The only thing I could possibly think of are the little, like, rotating images of the arcade cabinets.
2841165	2841985	I'm like, what? !
2843306	2861453	or maybe there's some maybe I just haven't seen it yet maybe there's like an unlockable demo for the new one or something that shows up but I was kind of surprised to see that I was like okay I know Mortal Kombat 3 and 2 and 1 did not run on the Unreal Engine no I'm pretty sure they did not this is funny to me so
2863183	2876592	Although, if they somehow enabled it to where they took the old mo-cap stuff and made it into actual 3D models with the mo-cap likenesses and stuff, it'd be very interesting to see something like that.
2876612	2881795	It's like, oh, hey, look, it's classic Mortal Kombat, but we can turn it in any direction, and it's 3D.
2882056	2882636	Oh, my God.
2882976	2884357	Some might pay for that.
2884397	2888960	Tigerclaw in our chatroom at chat.orange.com says, an Unreal web-based game is possible.
2889020	2890741	Look at Quake Live, for example.
2891162	2891922	Well, there's a good example.
2891962	2892943	Quake Live is a good time.
2894645	2897268	So, I'd like to see more stuff like that, certainly.
2897288	2898449	It would be very interesting.
2898729	2911503	It would also be interesting to see what MMOs, you know, that's another big thing that web browsers are used for, some of those like free MMOs, and although the quality of some of those is questionable, you know, this could take a lot of that to the next level.
2911523	2912664	It would be interesting to see what happens.
2913125	2913906	Dear Square Enix,
2915293	2917476	Final Fantasy XIV Last Revenant
2936664	2940988	No, I remember that because I think Alan bought it or he had it or played it or something.
2941709	2943010	I thought there was another... No!
2943090	2946373	Final Fantasy XIII uses Unreal.
2947074	2947394	Oh, really?
2947614	2948255	I think it does.
2948675	2948875	Yes.
2952915	2953555	You know what I miss?
2954036	2955056	That game of the Bouncer.
2955197	2956157	That was pretty cool.
2957098	2957298	What?
2957318	2958078	What are you talking about?
2958098	2959960	Remember the Square Enix game, The Bouncer?
2960560	2961120	I remember that game.
2961140	2961641	Their brawler.
2961981	2967885	I do... I remember a brawler called Ergeis, but I don't remember... Oh, Ergeis was awesome.
2968165	2970086	That's a game they need a sequel for right there.
2970326	2972848	The Bouncer was an early PS2 title.
2973268	2974509	Yeah, and it was actually pretty awesome.
2974789	2978232	Where they all looked like Final Fantasy X characters, except they worked in a bar.
2980573	2981114	As bouncers.
2981294	2981754	As bouncers.
2983976	2984596	It was a weird game.
3012521	3014223	Oh, it looks hot.
3014603	3015444	It looks very hot.
3015824	3018606	It's Final Fantasy, but I have no idea why it's 13.
3018746	3022570	I know it's set in the same universe or whatever, but I didn't see any of the characters.
3022590	3022870	Not really.
3022910	3028515	I thought it was supposed to be more of a real... Yeah, I don't know what the hell it has to do with 13, but whatever.
3028535	3030877	There'll probably be some obscure little thing when you actually play the game.
3030897	3035601	But dude, the action, the battles kind of look like Kingdom Hearts, but with the hit points showing up on the screen.
3035621	3037002	I mean, obviously it's done by the Kingdom Hearts team.
3037302	3038323	It looks sweet, actually.
3039484	3045650	We're going to do an awesome radio moment here and I'm going to pull up the trailer here in studio and I'll post this in chat so you guys can see this too.
3045710	3054118	For those of you that are on the podcast feed, I'll have DarkSakura posted to our Tumblr at orangeloungeradio.tumblr.com.
3058075	3059496	Are you not an IRC, DarkSakura?
3059636	3060497	I am an IRC.
3060597	3060717	Oh.
3061297	3063679	I meant, like, privately, so I can copy the URL.
3063799	3065100	Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, I will, I will.
3065120	3067222	As soon as I pull it up here, because I can't remember.
3067262	3067682	Is this it?
3067782	3068803	No, this isn't the right one.
3069583	3071144	Where did I see that trailer?
3073426	3074647	Somebody in chat will probably...
3076380	3077321	Hello, Tigerclaw.
3079362	3079722	Right?
3080302	3081843	Tigerclaw should have posted it by now.
3082343	3083424	Gameplay trailer.
3083484	3084885	Maybe it's this.
3084905	3085565	No, that's Eidos.
3085585	3086706	That's Deus Ex.
3087987	3089207	Who the hell posted this?
3089448	3090528	And I watched it the other day.
3090548	3092229	I think somebody had posted it on Facebook.
3093630	3094991	Oh, so in other news.
3095471	3096432	No, kidding.
3097072	3098313	I have made fantastic nut bread.
3100034	3100954	It was quite delicious.
3101274	3102195	It has no flour.
3103891	3104731	I made it with no flour.
3104811	3105711	It's made with almond meal.
3105751	3108192	Good luck trying to find anything on the new Facebook, by the way.
3110592	3115093	Your mission, if you choose to accept it, find something on Facebook.
3115113	3117614	There's a plug-in for Chrome that makes it run like the old version.
3118374	3118654	Yes.
3118954	3120475	The problem is I don't want to use Chrome.
3121935	3122475	But, yeah.
3124155	3124416	Oh, yeah.
3124476	3124816	That's right.
3124836	3126276	They did have The Last Remnant on PC.
3128547	3130908	Anyway, well, Rob's looking that up.
3131969	3134190	I found one, but it's not the right one.
3134210	3135371	They did like a flip of it.
3135431	3141033	I'm trying to see if I can find the... Holy crap.
3141053	3143935	I'm trying to see if I can find the actual gameplay parts.
3148547	3150468	Oh, wait, this was uploaded in, like, 2009.
3150848	3151708	This isn't even right.
3151768	3152829	Gosh, darn it.
3153689	3156430	Somebody's... I've got to... Tiger Claw, find it for us.
3158131	3159571	I will keep looking for it.
3160612	3161412	Sorry, guys.
3161772	3163593	Terrible radio, but I know I saw it.
3164193	3164493	All right.
3166534	3167494	Shoot, the next story's mine.
3167534	3169075	I can't look for it while I talk about this story.
3169095	3172496	So I'll get through this quickly, although maybe not, because this is actually pretty big news.
3173977	3178279	Microsoft has talked a little bit this week about some of the TV updates for the Xbox 360.
3178719	3181160	Now we knew after E3 that they were going to be doing this.
3181180	3183241	They were going to be bringing more television to the 360.
3184261	3185822	But we didn't really know how.
3186302	3194206	Well, it turns out they've announced some partnerships and some of those include HBO and HBO Go, Comcast, Syfy, and Verizon.
3194246	3198028	I guess there was like an earlier list that had leaked and it turns out a lot of that seems to be correct.
3198728	3203572	They did publish a full list of the partners that will be in the fall dashboard update.
3204052	3210716	Comcast went so far as to make a blog post talking about using the partnership with Microsoft to offer Xfinity content.
3211037	3217241	So it sounds like, and this is of direct relevance to me because I have Comcast at home living where I live.
3218001	3223625	It sounds like that you will be able to use the on-demand system in Comcast.
3224065	3227467	You can use that in the 360 now.
3230048	3231069	But see, that's the thing.
3231109	3235690	I was hoping it would be more original stuff and not necessarily just everything that's on demand.
3235990	3241631	Because if I want to watch on demand, I can hit one button on my remote and I get on demand content.
3241791	3253414	I don't need to necessarily... Unless you're able to take your console to a friend's house or something like that and then you can access all your on demand content that way.
3254514	3254814	I don't know.
3255215	3257617	I was just hoping for more original stuff.
3257697	3261420	Like an alternative than me having to have cable, you know what I mean?
3262280	3264862	And there's already a bajillion alternatives out there anyway.
3266083	3269146	So I mean, this is just adding to the pile.
3270948	3282437	So what I'm also curious of is that if they're announcing all these other partnerships, the weird thing is though, doesn't HBO want to charge you $10 for their service and then these other... Well, HBO I don't think you can access unless you have HBO.
3282477	3285380	It's kind of like how Xfinity and stuff.
3285780	3288582	You can't access HBO on demand stuff unless you have HBO.
3288642	3289023	I get it.
3289043	3291505	And isn't it the same with like the mobile app?
3291545	3295168	Like you can't access mobile CNN video unless you have like Comcast or something?
3295188	3299351	Yeah, see, so that's why I was just kind of like, eh, don't really care.
3299491	3300192	I mean, because...
3300612	3309698	Well, I gotta say, though, I do like the idea that, you know, because the HBO stuff isn't on Netflix and it's not really on demand either, I like that it'll kind of be all in one place.
3310299	3320146	Like, I get what you're saying with the one button on the remote, but, you know, if the Xbox 360 is gonna be this all-in-one entertainment device, it'd be nice to... If you can DVR stuff, that'd be pretty awesome, because then that way I don't have to pay for DVR.
3322147	3324128	I don't think that's gonna happen, but, you know...
3325790	3332534	Also, it looks like AT&T U-Verse is going to require Xbox Live Gold starting in November.
3332614	3338679	That was a note that was sent by the AT&T folks to their customers, which I'm assuming is lining it up with everything else here, right?
3338699	3341360	The TV service will actually require Xbox Live Gold.
3342501	3343002	All of them.
3344082	3353489	But before their boxes or whatever through AT&T U-Verse, because some of them still already have that, they do not require gold.
3355043	3356324	But they will now come November.
3356504	3356745	Yes.
3357285	3358806	That might make some people a little bit upset.
3361308	3362910	But not AT&T customers though.
3364311	3364491	Nope.
3365071	3366773	Because they're giving them a $60 credit.
3367473	3367694	Right.
3368114	3375160	So yes, they give a $60 credit to existing AT&T U-verse customers for Xbox 360 customers.
3375200	3376821	Now is that each year or just one year?
3376921	3378382	I think it's just one time probably.
3379123	3380124	That would make sense.
3380663	3380863	Yep.
3381423	3383385	I want Comcast to give me 60 buck credit.
3384225	3385366	Alright, so who found this?
3385406	3386066	Loki found this.
3386186	3388027	Did you find this with somebody's help in chat?
3388207	3391269	Nope, I searched Final Fantasy XIII versus sort by date.
3391830	3392810	Alright, well, good job.
3392890	3395792	Here's what the gameplay looks like in the game.
3397990	3401751	So you can kind of see there's some, like, little live-action things that happen.
3401791	3407033	But definitely the walking around still kind of looks XIII-ish, but there's, like, a lot of lifestyle.
3407053	3407613	Here's some battle.
3407713	3408633	What's he doing in New York?
3408653	3409153	Right?
3409273	3413054	It's kind of Kingdom Hearts-ish, but with that very Final Fantasy VII, er, VII slash XIII environment, you know what I mean?
3413075	3413975	The swirly bits look like XII.
3426140	3427262	Yeah, I can see that.
3427502	3429104	I can see a little bit of 12 here, too.
3429785	3431187	But I like this, too.
3431247	3436295	Did you notice those little pictures in the corner of the people are actually live rendering what the people are doing?
3436315	3437456	That's pretty cool.
3438478	3439159	Here, watch here.
3439179	3439299	See?
3440140	3440580	That's cool.
3440881	3441762	Yeah, it's awesome.
3441782	3442923	It's not just a static picture.
3442963	3444124	It's like what they're doing.
3444144	3449929	That's like that add-on I use in the manual.
3449949	3450650	It's like X-Pearl.
3450710	3451730	Yeah, it's X-Pearl.
3453152	3454333	Final Fantasy X-Pearl.
3454553	3454993	So there you go.
3455013	3456635	There's what your Final Fantasy looks like.
3456695	3457155	Is that Cloud?
3457175	3460098	I know, it looks just like Cloud, doesn't it?
3460118	3461119	It's Cloud with a gun.
3461279	3463141	Send me that and I'll put it on our Tumblr.
3464742	3465562	Our tumble bubble.
3465602	3469764	There it is for the chatters, because I know us watching trailers isn't always the best radio, but there you go.
3469804	3471824	Now you have a place you can go look it up if you haven't already seen it.
3472965	3476146	So, I guess let's move on with some other gaming news.
3476586	3476926	DarkSakura.
3476946	3478467	Complete with an ad by Queen Latifah.
3480127	3483308	Sorry, DarkSakura, I got to distract you from the trailer to do your next story.
3483368	3485489	Well, how about some Skyward Sword characters?
3486649	3491031	There's actually a few spoilers, and you'll hear it here first.
3493941	3498823	Link and Zelda are childhood friends and have a special bond.
3499864	3504546	There is a bully at Link's school named Groose, G-R-O-O-S-E.
3505746	3510408	And there is a person named Fi, who is the spirit.
3510428	3511609	Don't worry, Link, it gets better.
3512129	3520935	Spirit of the Goddess Sword, and there's Gaepora, G-A-E-P-O-R-A, or is it Gaepora?
3521395	3524818	Who is Zelda's father and the headmaster of Link's school.
3526319	3530041	So there's another place in the game called Farron Woods.
3530782	3533804	Ooh, and you start off the game in a place called Skyloft.
3534925	3538788	And you can go to Skyview Temple where Zelda was kidnapped and is being held.
3539289	3539609	Again.
3540430	3541190	Yay.
3542151	3547937	As far as attacks that are in there, there's holding down the A button makes Link run faster and gives him acrobatic abilities.
3548397	3549558	He can run up walls.
3550699	3554102	I guess like he's Spider-Man or some shit.
3554523	3555724	Or the fucking Prince of Persia.
3556064	3562546	He can grab onto cliffs, but that uses Link's stamina, but you can replenish his stamina over time.
3562626	3569088	There's a spin attack that gives you stamina, and when your stamina is depleted, you go slowly.
3569208	3570688	You become Old Man Link.
3572509	3573569	And that's all I'm going to talk about it.
3574689	3576930	Although, there is one interesting thing that's in there.
3577070	3577730	You can douse.
3580215	3581776	Link in High School Saved by the Triforce
3605954	3633216	but anyway yes Tiffany Amber Thiessen will be playing the part of Zelda but for dowsing basically you hold out the sword and point it in the direction of the target and it will flash so basically it's to lead you in the right direction it's kind of what Shadow of the Colossus did it first so Bugs Bunny did it back in the you know in the 40s Simpsons did it I'm done
3633706	3634447	I'm so excited!
3634667	3635287	I'm so excited!
3635347	3636328	I'm so scared!
3636468	3638670	You know I never watched that show for a reason.
3667899	3670261	That was the infamous caffeine pills episode.
3670301	3671542	Jesse was addicted to caffeine pills.
3671602	3677746	I understand, but I never watched that show because I can't watch a show with people acting stupid.
3678787	3680048	Seriously, that's why I don't watch Seinfeld.
3680068	3682090	But yet you went with us to watch Showgirls.
3682810	3683911	Because that's different.
3683931	3685552	They weren't being stupid to be funny.
3686793	3688755	It was funny without trying to be funny.
3689437	3693942	Let's travel around the world and check out what's going to be coming to a game store near you.
3694723	3696324	Saved by the Bell Collection on Blu-ray, maybe?
3697005	3697325	I don't know.
3697425	3698827	That's not a game.
3699948	3700669	Thank God.
3700689	3702150	That'd be terrible.
3702391	3704533	Anything Saved by the Bell the game would be terrible.
3706195	3706896	Dead Rising 2 Dead Rising 2
3727152	3736221	Forza Motorsports 4 coming out this week on Xbox 360, both the regular and limited edition as well.
3737442	3746592	Some other things you can look forward to, Power Up Heroes, that is kind of a superhero connect game that's coming out.
3747092	3748893	Red Dead Redemption Game of the Year Edition.
3749133	3751795	Definitely a good buy if you haven't picked it up yet.

3756618	3758679	That's on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

3791774	3797697	Hulk Hogan's main event for Kinect on Xbox 360 this week.
3798797	3803759	The Hidden on the 3DS, kind of an augmented reality ghost hunting game.
3804420	3809942	Marvel's superhero squad, the Infinity Gauntlet on the 3DS this week, kind of a port of the old one.
3811042	3834768	as we've been talking a little bit about this game talking some of the tracks coming out and very surprisingly there's actually some really good tracks in here Dance Dance Revolution 2 for the Wii coming out game only and bundle and dirt cheap $29.99 for the game by itself bundles $50 and worth checking out if you're interested in some of the new arcade songs because they're in the game

3842562	3843665	I have my pre-order in

3868211	3868711	Rugby games.
3869292	3869852	They did that.
3869972	3870853	Yeah, it's weird.
3870973	3872734	The last rugby game that came out... People like rugby?
3873515	3878158	I understand that, but people don't like GameStop, and I don't want to go there to get my rugby game.
3879079	3879819	I mean, let's be real.
3879859	3881020	I'm not going to buy it.
3881281	3885123	505 did it with their last rugby game that came out at the beginning of September, and they made it inclusive of GameStop.
3885283	3890007	Yet nobody has explained to me what the fucking connection between GameStop and rugby is.
3891553	3892213	I have no clue.
3892653	3893074	No idea.
3894214	3911221	But 1,001 touch games for the DS, Might and Magic Heroes 6 on PC, and God, a game I hope tanks so goddamn bad, Skylanders Spyro's Adventure on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, 3DS, and PC may burn in hell.
3911341	3914322	And for the new listeners, why do you want this game to fail?
3914562	3915162	Thanks for watching!
3931227	3931907	Thanks for watching!
3951756	3961020	so that they can get on their top Hot 15 Toys list, which they did, and they have an exclusive pack over at Toys R Us, a three pack of their figures.
3961480	3966843	Yeah, because that Hot Games list, yeah, that's not manipulated at all to get people to buy shit.
3967203	3967403	Right.
3968263	3969324	So, hope it tanks.
3970544	3972545	So don't follow the Hot Games list.
3973291	3974372	Yes, don't follow it.
3974552	3975293	It's rigged.
3975373	3976513	It's not Spyro.
3976573	3979415	Okay, Spyro, it's not what it used to be.
3979616	3981997	It's just like us getting nominated for a podcast award.
3982017	3982738	Shenanigans.
3985313	3986574	It's just, it's really not worth it.
3986594	3990778	I mean, seriously, it's $70 to buy this game on a 3DS.
3991478	3993680	By the way, it's $70 for the 3DS.
3993740	3994561	Oh my god.
3994941	3997543	And $70 on every other platform except PC, which is $60.
3998484	4000106	Do you really want to spend $70 for a crappy Spyro game?
4000146	4001427	Will the little toys do my laundry?
4001727	4003088	Nope, they do nothing.
4003548	4004529	They do not move at all.
4006911	4007232	Alright.
4007332	4007832	I'm just saying.
4009574	4012496	This will be the next Tony Hawk ride game.
4012696	4013417	I mean, it's...
4016912	4018493	I will be surprised if this takes off.
4018974	4019955	Alright, we'll see what happens.
4020595	4023978	If that's it for your releases, then let's go to Japan and check out what's coming out in Japan.
4024318	4040411	On the Xbox 360 this week in Japan, Dead Rising 2 off the record, Forza Motorsport 4 gets its release in Japan, as well as Ace Combat, Assault Horizon, Call of Juarez, The Cartel, Halo Reach gets a price reduction in the Platinum Collection in Japan this week, and Connectimals gets a release.
4040651	4041852	Is this the one that has bears in it?
4041872	4042413	Plus bears, yeah.
4042453	4043193	Yeah, it's Connectimals
4043854	4046655	and Fushigi Nashima no Nakamatachi.
4047175	4047875	Yes, that's right.
4048576	4049316	Connectimals and bears.
4050916	4054218	By the way, when I was at Disneyland, I went in the Innovations Building.
4054578	4057379	They have a lot of Kinect stuff there in the Innovations Building.
4057419	4060580	You can play like Child of Eden and stuff, but they have a little room, and I thought this was neat.
4060600	4066902	They had a little room set up for like kids that had, and they were actually people working for Disney helping these kids play like Connectimals.
4067342	4069224	and they had it on a giant TV.
4069264	4071506	I'm talking like the size of like the wall in this house.
4071926	4073668	They had a giant TV playing Connectimals.
4073728	4074909	I gotta say, I thought it was pretty cute.
4075149	4076531	My friend Victoria played it for a little bit.
4076551	4077451	It was kind of fun.
4078512	4080574	It's nice to see some love in the Innovations building.
4080594	4081535	I thought it was closed.
4082136	4082216	It...
4083937	4085237	I think it kind of closes nobody.
4085277	4087658	It's been remodeled since the last time I was there.
4088158	4090499	And you don't enter the same way you used to.
4090539	4092179	There's no little show when you go in.
4092199	4093740	They figured that that was kind of dry.
4093780	4094620	I'd never been in there.
4094800	4095060	Yeah.
4095140	4096940	So now, well, we made it a point.
4097040	4100081	We said we each need to do something we've never done at Disneyland before.
4100181	4102142	And my friend Victoria had never been to the Innoventions building.
4102162	4103162	So I was like, well, we never go there.
4103202	4104022	Let's just go check it out.
4104482	4105262	So we went in.
4105322	4107143	And believe it or not, there's some neat stuff in there.
4107163	4108663	They still have some Microsoft Surfaces.
4108703	4109183	Remember those?
4109483	4109984	The tables?
4110264	4111044	Those were fun.
4111064	4111144	Yeah.
4111965	4114589	So what did you not do before Disneyland?
4114849	4116391	What did I not do before that we did?
4116612	4117212	I don't remember.
4118955	4119536	Did you go on the boat?
4121870	4122671	I like where we ate last time.
4152222	4152842	and New Orleans Square.
4153643	4154063	That was great.
4154203	4154864	Carnation what?
4155684	4157325	Carnation Plaza Gardens.
4157626	4163930	It's been there since like the 50s and it's where they used to do some live shows and events but now it's like hardly anybody's there and it's right in the middle of the park.
4163950	4166511	That's the other little restaurant that's like at the end of Main Street, isn't it?
4166632	4167672	There's no restaurant there anymore.
4167992	4173916	I mean, but it was a restaurant at the end of Main Street that's across from where the buffet is on the opposite side.
4174036	4174257	Right.
4174377	4175037	Yes, it is.
4175317	4175557	Okay.
4175998	4176138	Yeah.
4176778	4179220	So you can name something in Disneyland and I can pretty much figure out where it is.
4181297	4185741	Alright, moving on to... I want to make sure I caught everything on the 360.
4186281	4186802	Yes, I did.
4186862	4201454	So let me go on to the PlayStation 3, which this week will get Ace Combat, Assault Horizon, Dead Rising 2 off the record, as well as Call of Juarez, The Cartel, and Medal of Honor gets a price reduction going into the Best Hits series.
4201954	4204617	And that is, again, PlayStation 3 in Japan.
4205617	4209481	Trying to quickly look and see if there's anything on 3DS this week, or...
4211818	4239308	The Wii even Let's see, the 3DS Nope, not this week There's a game called Aizito 3D, that's it But the Misty Pink 3DS has come out next week And I know Loki already has his pre-ordered On the Wii though, Just Dance Wii gets a Japanese release this week I guess that's notable, especially for music game fans I don't know if the song list has been localized or what have you You know, I was going to mention something real quick Because I noticed this last night when I was checking to see Dead Rising 2 I didn't download content Right
4239848	4245154	Just Dance 3, for their download content, what they have is they have it where you can download trials.
4245374	4247516	So you can check out the songs before you buy them.
4247716	4248757	I think that's a great idea.
4249398	4252321	And I know they do that with Rock Band, but some other music games do not.
4254803	4257085	So yeah, Just Dance on the Wii makes its way to Japan this week.
4257405	4258707	And that's it for Japanese releases.
4259247	4263051	How about overseas, DarkSakura, the other way?
4263410	4269016	Dragon's Age 2, Mark of the Assassin, Just Dance 3, Guardian Heroes, Orcs Must Die, Ace Combat Assault Horizon, Dead Rising 2,
4284373	4298667	Forza Motorsport 4, Might and Magic Heroes 6, PES 2012, Renegade Ops, Sesame Street Once Upon a Monster, Spider-Man Edge of Time, and World Rally Championship 2.
4300689	4300949	Blech.
4303266	4310708	Alright, well, let's move on with a couple more news stories and then we'll let DarkSakura have at the classic game of the week.
4311308	4314529	By the way, I just gotta say, Part B tonight's gonna be action-packed.
4314789	4323251	Usually all the good stuff's in Part A, but there's some awesome stuff coming for Part B. So I'm just saying, for those of you that sometimes want to tune out halfway through, you want to stick around tonight.
4323992	4325532	So I'll tell you why in just a minute.
4327996	4332380	So they announced some cool stuff this week during the Apple press conference.
4332941	4335343	Of course, the new thing being the iPhone 4S.
4335383	4336745	Sorry, not iPhone 5.
4336785	4337345	But you know what?
4338406	4338987	It's just a name.
4339467	4340428	It's seriously just a name.
4340688	4343571	Everyone's like, man, I'm so bummed they didn't announce the iPhone 5.
4344272	4344912	Thanks for watching!
4361278	4374954	And quite frankly, I'm kind of glad they're not putting out the iPhone 5 now Because I'm still under contract on the 4 I'm not upgrade eligible until January So if there was like that awesome of a phone coming I would be kind of upset I get to upgrade next month Do you?
4375134	4378458	Yeah So you can get a 4S Yeah Do you think you'll get one?
4378658	4378858	Yeah.
4379299	4379599	Okay.
4380119	4381601	Although Dan's considering getting an Android.
4381801	4383002	Are you getting excited about Siri?
4383162	4384663	Siri, explain to me the meaning of life.
4384683	4387306	I really don't give a shit about Siri, but I'll try it.
4387666	4387866	Yeah.
4388527	4389107	So, I mean.
4389708	4390548	You can try it now.
4390588	4399716	I've read about the Siri pranking on the internet, like some good phrases that people have thought up to yell, like when your friend activates Siri, like things that you would yell.
4400917	4402778	Siri, text my mom that I'm gay.
4402958	4403298	Send.
4405098	4407479	You know, just prank things to send.
4407919	4411820	That's going to be a brand new era of damn you autocorrect.
4411980	4413480	Yes, yes, it will be.
4413680	4414240	Oh my gosh.
4414480	4416261	Michelle, Michelle, are you listening?
4416301	4418701	Michelle, you better get that thing registered right now.
4419282	4420082	Damn you, Siri.
4420302	4421642	Damn you, Siri.com.
4424483	4424763	All right.
4426071	4430633	Um, so anyways, the iPhone 4S is coming October 14th.
4430953	4435395	It adds a brand new processor, the A5 processor, which is apparently dual core.
4436395	4441617	Up to seven times the graphics capability and enhanced, you know...
4441937	4446900	Camera, more RAM, all sorts of new features.
4447040	4448541	Siri, of course, as you mentioned.
4451403	4457167	New antenna design, GSM and CDMA radios in the device.
4458748	4462030	It's going to be available in three different flavors, if you will.
4462230	4463651	16GB, 32GB, and 64GB, ranging from $199 to $399.
4463771	4465072	And, of course, in white or black colors.
4470695	4485553	and then of course they're dropping the iPhone 4 down to $99 for the 8GB model and the 3GS will apparently be free if you have a plan obviously and that would be the 8GB model as well.
4487875	4490958	Some other fun stuff, of course, iOS 5 is coming October 12th.
4491658	4500485	With that, they're going to be bringing iCloud and AirPlay to gaming, so you'll be able to play with multiple devices, streaming to TVs.
4500505	4513074	In fact, one of the first games to support that, Real Racing 2, will allow you to stream, I believe, up to four devices to your TV and do split-screen gaming with it being on your iPhone.
4513334	4515436	I had no idea that this was a feature in it.
4515456	4517157	Did they even talk about this at the press conference?
4517737	4518198	I think they did.
4518418	4519038	Holy moly.
4519138	4520359	I slept through it.
4520379	4521800	Well, I was reading live blogs, too.
4521840	4524622	I was at work, so I had to kind of just on my break look.
4525283	4535029	And it's like, you know, showing, was it, you can run it, of course, on your iPhone 4S or on your iPad 2 and stream wirelessly.
4535069	4539673	Because before they had it where you can link it up to your TV, but you had to hook up an HDMI cable and stuff, so...
4540433	4562281	And of course, along with that, since the phone can have a little bit more horsepower, Infinity Blade 2 is coming to... And since Apple is the king of handheld gaming, so they claim this week, which is... You know, the way they spin the numbers is interesting, and I don't doubt it at all, but it's interesting, I can say.
4562521	4572027	Infinity Blade 2 becoming the iOS December 1st of course it's going to look extra pretty on the 4S but it will be I believe compatible with other devices as well
4574923	4603674	of course why would you shut out your other exactly so yeah very interesting though well I want to go back to Siri for a minute because I forgot about this little commercial I'd seen on Facebook and so forth that was floating around the internet and then TigerCloud just linked it in chat and this does have to do with gaming a little bit this is a commercial for the new Siri feature on the iPhone 4S take a listen read me the message
4604170	4606212	New message from K. Bad news.
4606992	4608534	Combustible lemons failed.
4608674	4609635	Can you meet us at 10?
4610475	4611036	Reply?
4611576	4612177	Definitely.

4615400	4616020	Enjoy.
4616440	4617982	What's the traffic like around here?
4618022	4620184	The traffic will be slow and meaningless.
4621024	4622706	Just like your sad little life.
4623286	4625108	Text my wife I'm gonna be 30 minutes late.
4625128	4625828	She won't mind.
4626108	4627710	She doesn't really love you anyway.
4628908	4631189	Is it going to be chilly in San Francisco this weekend?
4631469	4632229	Not too cold.
4632509	4636531	Your few extra pounds should be suitable insulation to keep you warm.
4636771	4637831	What about Napa Valley?
4638272	4639612	I hear it's beautiful there.
4640092	4640653	Unlike you.
4640913	4642393	How many cups are in 12 ounces?
4643234	4643794	Let me think.
4644354	4646875	Do you really need to make those extra cupcakes?
4647475	4648896	Set my timer for 30 minutes?
4649356	4651157	Okay, 30 minutes and counting.
4651917	4654018	Until I enter sad attempt at a life.
4658246	4662889	New Notification from Sandy Chen Are we still on for dinner tonight?
4663189	4665051	Perhaps you should have a snack instead.
4665431	4666552	You're looking a little heavy.
4667065	4667565	Reply.
4667925	4668686	Sure, I'll be there.
4669166	4671127	Here's your reply to Sandy Chen.
4671207	4671628	Sure.
4672188	4672948	I will be there.
4673148	4674969	Me and my extra 20 pounds.
4676010	4677130	Sandy.
4678931	4680612	Yes, that's GLaDOS.
4680812	4682593	GLaDOS Siri is what they're calling that.
4682714	4683714	That is amazing.
4683814	4685015	Is that all clips from the game?
4685135	4686255	That's a voice modulator.
4686355	4688857	No, somebody actually... Actually, the YouTube guy says this.
4688897	4692419	By the way, that was YouTube user BAMFER23 that that came from.
4692859	4696121	And I guess he actually did a whole thing with the...
4697221	4724832	with a voice modulator awesome need to get this voice modulator yeah that was a well done parody I like that and I do think that commercial is interesting because I remember when Apple announced FaceTime it was a huge thing that they used deaf people in the commercial and it really kind of did make you think like wow that's a big advance for deaf folks but this one the Siri thing uses blind people to like be sending the text messages which is very very interesting I think it's very neat
4727614	4755875	you wouldn't know it from that parody commercial because all the jokes are about weight but I just thought that was neat definitely gets you thinking about some of these advances in technology anyhow let's move on with some more gaming news and this one has to do with the French a French court has banned a DS game copier prosecutors won an appeal this was two years after French courts actually ruled that DS flash cartridge sellers were okay
4756255	4761398	Well, the Paris Court of Appeals actually has now ruled against the DS Flash cartridge sellers.
4762739	4767941	These various companies that sell devices like the R4 device, which I think you all know what that is.
4769162	4773624	Nintendo, I guess, said that the companies have been charged €460,000 in criminal fines and €4.8 million in damages to Nintendo.
4773644	4773744	Yikes.
4780988	4809695	so hmm I guess Nintendo has been taking action on piracy all over the globe and they even have a site I love it there was a site with a very very angry looking Mario on it that discusses the piracy so I thought it was interesting so there you go it's a thing and you know what I wonder if there will be an appeal to the appeal that would be what would be next right it is the French Rob I mean please
4810390	4811551	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4838470	4840511	All right, what is the classic game of the week, DarkSakura?
4840811	4841151	Mappy.
4843313	4844573	Mappy, good old Mappy.
4845354	4849236	Game that came out in 1983 when I was 10 years old.
4850796	4851797	I love the music in this game.
4851817	4853598	Isn't it happy?
4856604	4857844	A little too happy, I think.
4858844	4861365	Well, anyway, it was put out by Namco.
4861725	4864586	In the U.S., it was manufactured and distributed by Bally Midway.
4865206	4871247	It is a side-scrolling platformer that has a police mouse and some cats.
4872487	4878928	And Mappy, basically, the game runs on Namco's Super Pac-Man hardware.
4879108	4881869	And they modified it to have the horizontal scrolling.
4882649	4892083	And it comes from, well, at least according to the article, it says that it's derived from the term mappo, which is a slightly insulting name for a policeman.
4893692	4903277	So anyway, basically you run through a mansion with all these cats called mewkies, or in the US they were called meowkies, and you rescue stolen goods.
4903877	4914242	You go left and right, and you can jump on these trampolines that will bounce you to different floors, and you have one button that lets you open and close doors.
4914838	4920700	So you can get a radio for 100 points, a television for 200, a computer for 300, the Mona Lisa for 400, and a safe for 500.
4921620	4922521	But they come in pairs.
4922721	4924621	Wait, how many copies of the Mona Lisa exist?
4924781	4925882	I have no friggin' clue.
4925942	4926682	Not in Mappyland.
4926702	4927982	Uh, which is another game.
4928062	4929003	Ha ha, I have it.
4929603	4929683	Um...
4930731	4931811	There was a Mappyland, huh?
4931831	4932292	I forgot about that.
4932312	4934592	There was, and it's sitting in my room, in the vault.
4935353	4942215	So at any rate, if you get one item and then get its pair, you actually get a score multiplier.
4942335	4945617	So the more of those that you get without dying, the bigger the multiplier gets.
4946517	4951719	So you want to start off at the lowest and go to the highest, so you can actually get 8,500 points.
4951739	4951799	And...
4954565	4955728	Because they're fun!
4965433	4969637	Mappy and the cats can only land on a floor on the way up, not on the way down.
4970258	4973821	But if they pass in the air, the cats won't hurt Mappy.
4973901	4978085	But if they run into him when he's on a platform, then he will lose a life.
4978645	4982329	And the trampolines can break if you jump on them four times in a row.
4982369	4983309	They'll change colors.
4984390	4984511	Um...
4985971	5003460	So basically as you go through the game, there is a boss in the game called Niamco, which is basically a play on the word Namco and Nyanco, which is like kitten, kitty cat.
5004821	5008703	But in the US he was named Goro, and he's faster, but a little less aggressive.
5009723	5032816	and so you can uh he'll actually hide behind different objects so if you go over the object that he's hiding behind you get um a thousand points for having caught him so it's kind of cool um you've got different hallways like I said you can open and shut doors keep the mukees out and you have microwave doors which release sound waves that will sweep the kitty cats away
5033636	5035176	Did you say microwave doors?
5035357	5036257	Yeah, microwave doors.
5036637	5037517	Did they make popcorn?
5037717	5041198	See, I always wish that they were, like, I always considered them to be, like, sound waves.
5041758	5044759	Which makes more sense to me, but apparently they're microwaves, so, yeah, go big.
5045599	5055162	So, um, basically after every bonus round, you did get bonus rounds, um, after, um, the, every fourth level, so it's a bonus round.
5055722	5062124	And so that's basically you running around on trampolines, popping different balloons, and Nyamco is hidden somewhere in there.
5063004	5065767	And after the bonus run, you get a new feature in the gameplay.
5066387	5069250	After the first one, you get Addicts.
5070211	5071112	Although there's nothing in them.
5072093	5076217	You get, after the seventh bonus level, you get bells.
5076437	5078258	So you can get bells that freeze the cats.
5078278	5079840	300 points for each.
5080180	5081361	And 1,000 points for studying Nyamco.
5082342	5086245	Uh, you also get hurry signs, you know, that tell you to speed the fuck up.
5086806	5094632	You get rainbow floors after the 11th, which, um, basically, they're mini floors, they vanish, and they leave a hole in the hallway.
5094932	5095652	Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.
5095692	5099755	If you guys are doing any excess downloading, kill it, because we're having buffering problems.
5099976	5101297	The live listeners are... Yeah, I'm not doing anything.
5101697	5102458	I'm not downloading anything.
5102978	5103959	Eh, it's out of my control then.
5104839	5110864	Yeah, our upload will upload and then kind of freeze on a number for a minute and then keep going, and it's causing the listeners to be all like, what's going on, right?
5111224	5113666	Alright, well, I closed a few things, so maybe that'll help.
5114867	5120070	But anyway, you just get all these different bonuses, including the rainbow floors and dead ends.
5120770	5129016	There are 256 rounds, just like in Pac-Man, and the last one is normal but harder than usual.
5129476	5133439	And if you finish it, it's also known as round zero, the first round starts over again.
5134520	5138565	It came out in the Famicom and the NES, of course, and the MSX in 1984.
5139666	5148117	There was a video game console-only version that was called Mappyland, which we've discussed.
5148137	5148537	It came out in 1986.
5151020	5154722	Um, it was also released for Microsoft Revenge of the Arcade for PC in 1998.
5155702	5163066	And then there were Japanese-only sequels that were hopping Mappy that came out in the arcade, and Mappy Kids for the Famicom in the late 1980s.
5163166	5168989	There's Mappy Arrangement that came out in the Namco Classics Volume 1, which I've got...
5169429	5174271	The Famicom version of the original Mappy was re-released in Japan as part of the Famicom miniseries in 2004.
5175212	5176272	Mappy is included on the Ms.
5176292	5185817	Pac-Man collection, and it's also featured in the Namco Museum 50th Anniversary collection that came out on Xbox, Nintendo GameCube, PC, and PlayStation 2, but not on the GBA.
5186497	5187979	and the Namco Museum DS.
5188139	5197832	It was also a part of Pac-Man's arcade party and it's playable on PSP version of the Namco Museum Battle Collection and there's a version of it for the Palm OS.
5198573	5201797	There's also one for .S and it's also on virtual console.
5203388	5206630	As far as other references, now this I think is kind of cool.
5206750	5207791	Some people have caught that.
5208191	5212173	Mappy is a playable character in Namco Super Wars on The Wonderspun Color.
5212753	5216276	You can get a Mappy hat in Namco Across Capcom in Ridge Racer.
5216676	5219758	There's the RT Blue Mappy team and the RT Pink Mappy team.
5222018	5224719	Mappy is playable in Pac-Man World Rally on PSP.
5224939	5229640	In R4, there again is racing teams that are the Mappy teams.
5229860	5234801	Mappy is in Quick Spot, which is in the North American version.
5235842	5239102	Mappy Land is the theme in Donkey Konga 3 and Technic Beat.
5239923	5243543	And Mappy is also in Noby Noby Boy as a resident of Jupiter.
5245464	5246284	Why Jupiter?
5246984	5247684	No freaking clue.
5249205	5249625	And that's it.
5249785	5250205	That's Mappy.
5250799	5251440	Alright, there it is.
5251460	5254002	Your classic game of the week is Mappy.
5256184	5263932	Alright, and it's available of course in the arcades primarily, but also on a hell of a lot of retro collections that DarkSakura listed off there earlier.
5264932	5266392	All right, well, we're going to take a quick break.
5266412	5268793	When we come back, there is more of Orange Launch Radio.
5268813	5275134	There's going to be an action-packed Part B tonight, and we're going to have a brand-new XBLA game announced.
5275715	5278855	I'm sorry, not Xbox Live Arcade, but the other one, XLA, XNA.
5279135	5280676	I can never remember what the hell they're called.
5280996	5281816	Indie Games.
5281856	5282156	Thank you.
5282176	5285217	We're going to have a brand-new one announced here on the show, and it's...
5286917	5288558	I've been briefed before the show.
5288618	5289799	DarkSakura and Loki have no clue.
5289819	5291000	I'm making it a surprise for them.
5291460	5293121	But it's going to be awesome.
5293141	5302186	So we're going to talk to the developer about that when we come back in part B with more of Orange Lounge Radio with rapid fire news and more news and all that good stuff.
5302206	5302926	So stay tuned.
5303427	5303887	Don't go anywhere.
5310270	5311330	DarkSakura not doing her job
5340596	5341677	I was doing your job.
5341758	5343759	What are you talking about, girl?
5343860	5345922	And then the FUs of the week.
5346402	5348204	And, of course, your phone calls, Skype.
5348244	5349565	Did you guys do Skype calls, at least?
5350066	5350446	Yes.
5351127	5351967	All three of them.
5352108	5352328	All right.
5352448	5352708	Anyhow.
5355751	5357292	DarkSakura is kind enough to kitty sit for our cats, Maruko and Sanrio.
5357312	5357773	Now that they love me.
5357793	5359634	And I always promise presents for kitty sitting.
5359654	5360335	So I'm giving that to her.
5360355	5362517	This is because Salacious Pop wanted to hear your reaction.
5362537	5362597	Woo!
5387442	5388533	I love you guys forever.
5389867	5393889	Okay, since that's terrible radio because you can't see, it's a Duffy hat is what I got her.
5394029	5396790	It's a Mickey hat, but it's in Duffy.
5396870	5398191	So that's from Alan and myself.
5398231	5398871	What's Duffy?
5399632	5402273	Duffy is... She just pointed at her hat.
5402693	5403913	Duffy is the Disney bear.
5404574	5407895	Dan calls him the focused interest group bear.
5408055	5410517	Now, did the other thing... There's another thing.
5410877	5411617	It's really small.
5411677	5412337	Did it fall out?
5412577	5413738	No, it's still in the hat then.
5414598	5416639	Where did... Oh, I see what he did with it.
5417040	5417880	Yes, it's right there.
5424095	5428719	So she's screaming not into a microphone, but it's a Duffy pin that she doesn't have.
5429159	5429660	So there you go.
5430721	5434484	Yep, that's from Alan and I. Oh, you're going to put a picture and put it on OrangeLivesRadio.com?
5434504	5434804	Damn right.
5436145	5438247	All right, she's putting that up right now on OrangeLivesRadio.com.
5438666	5445549	Duffy is the Disney bear and he's kind of like Build-A-Bear because he has all these different outfits and so forth, but you don't actually build him.
5445589	5447010	He's already kind of prearranged.
5447050	5447831	And I like the fur.
5447891	5449851	The fur is really kind of a neat texture.
5450472	5452673	But he's really big in Disney Tokyo.
5454014	5455434	I don't know why, but they love him there.
5455974	5458696	Because they like everything new and focus group oriented.
5458916	5459776	I mean, hi.
5460737	5461237	So there you go.
5461937	5463518	I love Duffy so much.
5463598	5465059	And I can't wait until we get Shelly Mae.
5466422	5486669	Shelly Mae is like Duffy's little girlfriend and she's cute too aww alright well there you go that's a thank you from us for watching the cats and I suppose a little bit taking over you know the administration of the show alright let's move on I'm wearing my ears all night we're going to do some rapid fire news so Loki why don't you start us off
5487341	5498045	Alright, well there's a new project headed up by Kenji Inafune and it's revealed as a game called King of Pirates and that's coming to the 3DS in 2012.
5498865	5504307	Now, not too much has been announced by it, but it's a pirate action game that takes place on a giant ocean.
5504707	5507848	It looks very similar to maybe like a Zelda type game or something like that.
5509749	5535252	and it is I guess published by Marvelous AQL the makers of the Harvest Moon series and right now it's only slated for Japan but who knows maybe it'll eventually come out over here in North America so that's pretty cool let's see he's actually working on something other than you know nothing since he got canned from Capcom or he left Capcom whatever
5537368	5542592	LA Noire, the team behind it, Team Bondi, is shutting down.
5544193	5548777	I can see why, because that game I think was delayed and delayed and delayed and delayed and delayed some more.
5550078	5552781	But apparently, though... How's that... Oops.
5553201	5555263	And that would be the delay music that you heard there.
5555303	5558746	How's that different from any other freaking video game out there?
5559667	5560647	It's like years.
5560788	5561068	I mean...
5562742	5563062	I don't know.
5563423	5568366	But anyways, apparently, though, they're saying that L.A.
5568406	5571128	Noire was, you know, a big hit, obviously.
5572029	5578473	However, though, because it was in development for seven years, it took its toll on the staff in the company.
5578874	5581155	Because of that, they are just kind of dissolving.
5581315	5583297	That is a long damn time for a game to be in development.
5583317	5591763	Yeah, the studio entered administration in August, and its assets are being sold to an Australian production company.
5594320	5599732	Kennedy Miller Mitchell so yeah it is being closed
5601272	5630257	and then finally this is kind of cool Battlefield 3 is going to ship on multiple discs on Xbox 360 and they have one disc is dedicated for the single player and then the second disc is multiplayer but also on that second disc is something else it is an optional install that you can do that will give you high res it will be a higher resolution texture pack so it will make the game look prettier if you want to install it to your hard drive
5630797	5631738	Oh, that's kind of neat, actually.
5631778	5632519	I think that's kind of cool.
5632659	5633680	That's really smart.
5634401	5637083	So maybe that'll make things look a little bit better.
5638305	5647454	I'm assuming it'll probably be pretty much the same as PlayStation 3, since obviously blue-gray discs have a lot more storage space, but that is kind of cool.
5649491	5650332	VVVVVV on the 3DS VVVVVV on the 3DS
5677789	5706896	and it will have some 3D effects now you have to remember VVVVVV is based off of a it's not based off of but it's highly inspired by a Commodore 64 game so that's the style of the graphics so I'm very curious what exactly they're going to 3D ties with this I'm assuming the sprites are in front textures in back I don't know so we'll see what they do with the 3D effects on this also the way they will utilize the double screen is that the bottom touch screen will always show the map
5707376	5709458	and the top screen will show the game that you're used to.
5709879	5711180	How do you think that'll look on a 3DS?
5711661	5720630	I think it'll be cool, but I'm worried though because being that the game is very frustrating and you may want to throw your controller, throwing a 3DS is probably not recommended.
5720690	5721411	Not a good idea.
5721951	5725755	They need to put a little attachment on a 3DS that's like a stress squeeze ball.
5725775	5727477	Something you can squeeze when you get really pissed off.
5729378	5747385	Also, information about Mario Kart 7, which is exciting, coming out on the 3DS soon Mario Kart 7, the Donkey Kong Returns folks, that's right, Retro Studios Apparently actually helped develop the Donkey Kong Returns themed level in the game, which I think is really cool
5748326	5768967	so that's some of the stuff they helped with on the game I can see a little bit of the track in here and it looks pretty cool I do like the whole Mario has a different variety of cars and the hang gliders and all that although Loki's not as much of a fan I think it would be kind of cool and I noticed in this one Donkey Kong is riding this giant tractor looking thing which looks funny
5769571	5770551	DarkSakra How did that happen?
5799250	5804315	Disney Trademarks Castle of Illusion, which was an old Genesis game.
5804976	5806937	But it was Castle of Illusion starring Mickey Mouse.
5807398	5810441	And it is targeted at the video game software.
5810521	5812042	So maybe they're going to re-release it.
5812242	5812563	Who knows?
5812603	5813784	Maybe we get it on a virtual console.
5815766	5816967	Also, Rock Band.
5817047	5821251	There is going to be a Facebook milestone celebration with Stevie Wonder.
5821491	5821711	Ooh.
5822472	5841886	It's actually since their Facebook page topped 2 million likes, Harmonix is letting the news out and saying the Rock Band 3's DLC is going to be going into... Let's see, we have Stevie Wonder, Coldplay, Breaking Benjamin, and Dream Theater, which having some Dream Theater on there, that's pretty awesome.
5842526	5846389	Because I know five people who know who Dream Theater is, so that's pretty cool.
5847390	5848571	And last but never least...
5850712	5857480	Steven Spielberg and DreamWorks are backing a Halo movie to come out in 2012.
5857640	5859222	That is false.
5860723	5861985	And let me finish.
5863466	5865448	Thank you for getting in on my damn story.
5867725	5873052	It was stated to Microsoft denied that it was in development.
5873132	5879160	They go on record saying that it is inaccurate and they have no plan for Halo feature right now.
5879281	5882124	Their focus is developing Halo Anniversary and Halo 4.
5882685	5884027	We all know it's going to happen eventually though.
5884963	5886584	Well, I mean... Someday!
5886944	5887584	It'll be terrible.
5888264	5895587	But then again, you know, I've talked a lot about the WoW movie before, and the World of Warcraft movie, I don't think that's ever going to happen at this point.
5896227	5898728	I think they missed their chance a couple years ago.
5898748	5900468	Thank God, because that sounds like a terrible idea.
5900628	5903089	Well, it could have been good, but it probably wouldn't have been.
5903349	5903769	No.
5903889	5904730	We all know it wouldn't have been.
5905450	5906451	It would have been terrible.
5906691	5906911	Hello, 000-123456?
5906931	5907031	What?
5907052	5907152	What?
5927897	5929637	That's what it says on the caller ID.
5930338	5932278	Well, Skype is really funny when it does that.
5932618	5934699	It shows funny things show up on the caller ID.
5935139	5936779	So, YYR, how are you doing, sir?
5936799	5943140	I think I'll be better once I have time to get some sleep.
5943360	5947941	But I am kind of excited for New York Comic Con later this week.
5948281	5950602	And I'm just...
5951300	5956558	Doing what I can to get done what I need to do on the two games I'm showing.
5957119	5958022	You know, so that...
5959170	5960771	I don't look like complete crap when I'm there.
5961071	5970378	So, yeah, you've been doing a lot of these conventions and I bet that's been a really good kind of exposure and help for you because, you know, I know you were at PAX East a while ago and I think you did it again.
5970398	5971438	I've gone to PAX East twice now.
5971578	5973860	Yeah, and now you've got the Comic Con coming up.
5974180	5974961	It's pretty exciting.
5975821	5987269	It is, and I'll tell you honestly, I haven't gotten a single major gaming site to cover me yet and I'm hoping maybe it'll be different this time, but to be completely honest, I think the major reason I'm doing it is just to
5987849	5988569	and so on.
6006517	6008879	Just seeing that is enough for me, to be honest.
6009079	6010400	Yeah, pretty much.
6010740	6013782	Well, the first one is the latest available build of Snake 361.
6013822	6014102	All right.
6028698	6030078	Obviously the sequel to Snake 360.
6030899	6034940	And there's a lot of stuff, a lot of stuff that's going to be in the new one.
6035180	6041921	I mean, levels that grow in the campaign, because I got criticized about, well, you know, Snake is a game about avoiding yourself.
6042041	6047443	And, well, as soon as you get long enough where it's a challenge, the level's done, and then you start over.
6047703	6052684	So in this game, you know, the campaign has levels that grow as you do.
6053214	6059477	and then you're challenged to continue going at the length that you're at through a two, three, four, or even more part level.
6060317	6061378	So that's one thing.
6061718	6063999	And then there are other things like survival mode.
6064299	6073223	There's still the traditional one, but then there's a three and five minute score rush where you're going to have to take more risks because you only have that much time.
6073603	6077305	And then there's something that's really unique and really fun called dual survival.
6077505	6081546	And the way that works is every time you take a target, you turn around.
6081746	6082767	You reverse direction.
6083095	6083495	Oh, God.
6083515	6087156	So you always have to be keeping track of where your head and your tail are.
6087556	6090517	It's a lot of fun, and it's a really, really great challenge.
6091298	6099000	I love how you've kind of taken the concept of Snake from the old school cell phones and just turned it into this just complex game in a way.
6099460	6102261	It's not complex, but you've given it so many more dimensions.
6102981	6104302	You should see the battle mode now.
6104322	6106042	There's even more modifiers.
6106182	6108623	I'm going to have seven modifiers now.
6109318	6113301	are available at Comic-Con, and you can turn them all on if you want.
6114502	6128433	It's just like everything from dead players remaining on the field when you die to, again, reversing direction every time you take a target to the level continuously shrinking.
6129593	6131595	It's just got a lot of stuff in there.
6132856	6136959	But one of the new things I'm premiering at Comic-Con is something called the Challenge Mode.
6137478	6141021	Eventually there are going to be a hundred different challenges, but at Comic-Con there are just ten.
6141642	6143484	And it's just, you know, a scenario.
6143884	6151951	Okay, you're here, you're in this level, you have to do this, you have this much time, you have this many movements, here are the restrictions, okay, go.
6152632	6154453	And I'm also going to have a contest.
6154513	6161019	If there's anybody who can clear the four hardest challenges that I bring with me in five attempts, they can win a year of live.
6161400	6162541	But to be completely honest...
6163203	6164764	I don't think anyone's going to be able to do it.
6164784	6166125	Ooh, you're throwing down the gauntlet.
6166385	6167025	All right.
6167145	6167486	Nice.
6167746	6172508	I mean, if someone thinks they can come prove me wrong, then they're quite welcome.
6172789	6173029	Nice.
6173249	6174930	By the way, YYR is live with us.
6174970	6181273	This isn't a prerecorded thing, so if you have questions in our chat room, go ahead and ask them, chat.orangelongeradio.com.
6181474	6184395	I know you're really excited about Snake 361, and so are we.
6184675	6188858	It's looking to be a great game, but I got to tell you, I want to talk about project number two.
6188878	6189778	Okay.
6191239	6193701	Well, you know what, the seeds for Project No.
6193901	6196502	2 were planted a long time ago.
6198463	6218295	If you can recall, shortly after Sneak360 came out, and I talked about it right here on OLR, one of the weeks immediately after that, you guys were throwing around some ideas, and it's funny, I don't have the chat log, but I do distinctly remember that someone was like, hey, YYR, get on that.
6219015	6220096	And at the time, I didn't.
6220712	6225773	But I was just thinking about it, and sometime this summer I said, you know what?
6226433	6227513	I think I'm going to get on it.
6228394	6243817	So I threw together a trailer last night that kind of brings back something about... Basically, I have your discussion in there, and...
6245006	6247707	Yeah, really the trailer speaks for itself.
6247767	6249188	It speaks better than I ever could.
6250589	6251689	Why don't we take it away then?
6251949	6257612	I'm going to play this here in studio, the trailer, and I think you're going to link it for our chatters if they want to see it.
6257792	6262734	I thought originally this was YouTube, but it's not, so we'll figure out a way to get it on Tumblr for the podcast.
6262774	6268697	I'll tell you something, it's a direct link to an MP4 download on my site.
6268837	6270038	To be honest...
6270851	6276034	Most people, when they click on it, either it'll just play or they'll be able to download it to their desktop.
6276054	6280977	There'll be a very, very, very brief delay while it downloads because it's not very big, and then it'll play.
6282898	6287661	For most people, and of course MP4 is a format that pretty much everybody can play.
6289077	6315227	Most phones even should be able to handle it Alright, we'll get it on the Tumblr And I'm sure people can figure it out We got smart listeners So here it is The world premiere of the secret project That YYR has been working on That apparently we have had a hand in unknowingly So here we go Let's start off here Of course now I just have to wait for the buffering I just put the link in chat I just have to wait for the buffering now I should have loaded this in advance Yeah, Rob Shame on me
6316462	6316902	Good job.
6317543	6318303	You live, you learn.
6318323	6320645	This would have been a great time to talk about more.
6320685	6323487	Are you doing any other live appearances this year besides New York Comic Con?
6324408	6326970	Next after this is going to be MAGFest in January.
6327631	6327951	All right.
6328071	6328932	Which is in the D.C.
6329032	6329372	area.
6329612	6335757	And it's just one big orgasm of gaming and music and gaming-related music.
6335817	6337038	And it's just amazing.
6337338	6337618	Hold on.
6337698	6338059	It loaded.
6338139	6338479	It loaded.
6338499	6339059	We've got to play it.
6339099	6341261	I've never seen so many video games in a room before.
6341481	6341902	It loaded.
6341942	6342362	Here we go.
6342382	6342942	All right.
6346089	6346529	on the DS.
6347130	6347530	Ferret!
6349051	6351192	Return the ferret, I command thee.
6351272	6352893	I need to put it like on a bungee cord.
6352913	6356455	You do need to put it on a bungee cord so every time you throw it, you can yank it back.
6357216	6357856	It's a bungee ferret.
6357876	6359577	Not that I should be encouraging you to do this.
6360258	6361658	Wait, you know what they need to do?
6362179	6369523	Wait, since we've been talking community games and all this stuff and all this good Xbox Live thing, shouldn't they have a game called Bungee Ferret Tossing?
6370324	6372745	It could be like Orange Lounge Radio presents Bungee Ferret Tossing.
6372825	6375467	Add this to the list of Orange Lounge Radio dream games.
6375687	6375747	Or...
6376107	6379349	No, add this to the list of Orange Launch Radio reality games.
6379489	6381470	We need to tell Becky about the dream games.
6381490	6383811	We need to learn how to program or something.
6383851	6386012	We have a series of games that we're developing.
6386032	6386873	DarkSakura, you're in school.
6386913	6387933	Take a class on programming.
6394096	6398018	Our ferret engineers have created time ferrets with a two-second fuse.
6398339	6399059	This is great.
6401727	6429241	and you've got a guy dangling from a helicopter and he is throwing ferrets that explode that explode in bloody messes on the unsuspecting people below who are shooting at you who are shooting missiles at you while you fly around it is bungee ferret tossing inspired by OLR for better or worse it will be playable at New York Comic Con coming to Xbox 360 later this year from I guess a new division that you're working with MRG
6430757	6449403	Yeah, well, it's, you know what, I came up with an alternate name, MRG, Mostly Random Games, and, because basically, like, my label, YYR Games, has always been about just straight-up serious arcade-style games, and, well, this is anything but serious, so, I wanted to just separate it slightly.
6449663	6450984	I understand, I understand.
6452096	6453437	I'm having so much fun with this.
6453917	6456559	And everyone who's tried it so far really loves the concept.
6456619	6461902	And to be completely honest, the graphics, as with my other games, they're nothing special.
6462022	6466805	And I'm considering having a lot of them redrawn by someone a little more professional than me.
6466905	6471727	But everyone who's tried it so far, they really like the way it plays.
6471747	6477010	Because basically the thing is, you're fighting terrorism, as we all should be doing.
6477871	6479872	Of course the terrorists have to fight terrorism.
6479932	6481233	I want to make you a flyer.
6484177	6486079	He's got New York Comic Con coming up Friday, you should.
6487881	6497552	I actually have something in the printer, and by the way, there's a big red box on it that says, you know, the concept of bungee-throwing is a joke, never throw an animal in real life.
6498233	6499735	That's good, you don't want PETA on your ass.
6499815	6502318	Unless you throw Shermie, who'll just land with a splat.
6503239	6504220	She's too heavy to throw.
6505069	6512034	Although, to be completely honest, I wouldn't be 100% sad if PETA was on my ass because they say any publicity is good publicity, right?
6512094	6512595	That's true.
6512795	6514256	So what are you controlling in the game?
6514296	6515637	Are you controlling the helicopter?
6516498	6526305	Well, this is a great example, I think, of a game that would not be possible in its current form on a smartphone or on something that doesn't have, you know, thumbsticks and buttons.
6526646	6529348	This is going to be, I think, a great, you know...
6530089	6534891	Peace of Ammo in the War on, you know, oh, well, cell phones can do everything.
6534991	6536631	Smart phones can do all kinds of games.
6536971	6547295	Because basically, the way this game works is using the left thumbstick, you control the helicopter's movement, and using the right thumbstick, you can control the guy, you know, the dude, I call him,
6547694	6549195	Hang on the end of the helicopter.
6549576	6552779	If you push the right stick up and down, you can control the chord length.
6552859	6553619	Doesn't Dude need a name?
6553639	6555101	And if you push left and right, you can swing.
6555301	6556722	Wait, we need to give Dude a name.
6557223	6558484	Like, the hero needs a name.
6558924	6559405	Fernando.
6560906	6562147	Fernando, sure, okay.
6562167	6563729	Fernando, like the ABBA song?
6563889	6564169	Yeah.
6566011	6567612	Can you hear the drums, Fernando?
6567752	6569133	His name is Fernando ABBA.
6569434	6570935	I guess we named your guy Fernando.
6571496	6572516	Yes, I'm writing it down.
6573617	6576338	I have SSJ100 Matt here with me, actually.
6577298	6579539	He's a little surprised that I'm writing it down, but you know what?
6579559	6580259	I'm going to forget it.
6581579	6583040	How could you forget an ABBA song?
6583280	6583920	I'm just kidding.
6584320	6586521	Well, I got so much stuff.
6586681	6590322	I started the day with no music and sound effects in the game.
6590362	6591922	Now they're all done and I have to put them in.
6594643	6595823	It's been busy.
6596103	6599904	So anyway, Fernando here, he's fighting terrorists.
6600164	6602485	We discover the location of their base in the desert.
6602918	6607983	but the thing is they have advanced stealth radar detection technology so we can't send in the army.
6608363	6615110	So instead we send in one stealth helicopter and Fernando, who is armed with the latest in ferret weapons technology.
6615450	6618914	Now you know how they have in movies, they have like, oh let's show the schematics.
6619294	6627402	And you get this screen with like a green grid and on top there's some kind of wireframe image of some, you know, complicated technology.
6628425	6634828	In the opening sequence, when it's eventually done, you're going to see that, except it's just going to be ferret dynamite.
6638290	6638770	That is amazing.
6638790	6640391	That's the ferret weapons technology.
6641031	6649575	And then at the end of the game, you realize that the terrorists have somehow reverse-engineered the ferret weapons technology in their attempt to use it on you.
6649815	6655318	So that's an exciting little thing waiting for you at the end of the game.
6655876	6671148	Although there may be, depending on time, an alternate boss at the end of hard mode that actually Matt here came up with, and it's just as ridiculous as the game concept itself, and hopefully I can get that in there so you all can laugh at it.
6671434	6676099	Well, I gotta say, I am just like... Is it Shermie's fat butt?
6676960	6680143	On behalf of all of us, I'm just like, I'm like... I'm tickled.
6680163	6680884	Seriously.
6681284	6683106	Yeah, I think tickled is the right word.
6683206	6689152	Like, just tickled that one of our dream game ideas is fucking happening!
6689352	6689873	I know!
6691494	6692415	And it's all you, buddy.
6692455	6694736	We're not going to sue you over using our ID or whatever.
6694776	6696457	We say you earned the money, so keep it.
6696517	6698138	We're not going to chase after you.
6698178	6701580	We know you're going to plug us somewhere, and it's all good.
6702020	6704361	I want to share it with Dynamite.
6704701	6705542	It's going to be your biggest game yet.
6705562	6712785	So far, I haven't really seen a whole lot of money from the dollar games I put out, but if I do see any volume of money, at the very least, I'll make a trip out there, and I'll buy you guys a beer.
6714186	6714527	Yes!
6714607	6715708	Now hold on.
6715988	6716910	I love beer.
6716990	6718151	We only drink hard liquor.
6718171	6719933	At least I... I drink good beer.
6720193	6721354	I haven't drank in six months.
6721414	6722315	I'll buy Jamie a beer.
6722356	6723497	I'll get you something harder.
6725415	6728076	Rob would like a root beer float.
6728616	6729556	Virgin pina colada.
6730357	6731877	Loki would like ten shots of tequila.
6731917	6733158	The trailer is out there.
6733338	6735559	We're going to post the link to our Tumblr as well.
6736479	6740501	Our chatters are just do want OMG XD.
6740941	6742241	I'd buy that for a dollar.
6742501	6743662	Have you determined the price yet?
6745218	6772855	it will be a dollar a dollar okay so like seriously guys it's a whole dollar and you always have those leftover points anyway for when you buy the big points and buy rock band songs I have a dollar left over actually alright I can pay a dollar for Bungie Ferrets so I am legit excited any idea on a release time frame or too soon to tell you're just kind of demoing it right now I am going to be rushing my butt off to have it out by the end of the year beyond that
6773804	6776165	I don't have an absolute clue.
6776245	6782167	However, you can know for certain that I will be here letting you know when that is.
6782707	6783267	Absolutely.
6783307	6787129	Because I feel like, you know, OLR and this game are kind of tied together.
6790210	6790750	We're tickled.
6791110	6794331	If you listen to OLR, you will know first when it's coming out.
6795080	6795380	All right.
6795600	6796321	Oh, I like that.
6796721	6797022	Awesome.
6797042	6800945	We will take you up on that deal, and we will absolutely be following up with you in future weeks.
6801285	6805388	Best of luck on programming with the project and all the tireless nights you put in.
6805648	6807429	Have a kick-ass time in New York Comic Con.
6807469	6814695	I wish I was going to be there, but I won't, sadly, because I didn't know there was going to be a bunch of fair tossing in there.
6814995	6816856	It's going to be at New York Comic Con, definitely.
6816897	6822301	Stop by and give it a shot and tell me what you think, and give me all your feedback, good, bad, ugly, whatever.
6823087	6827737	awesome YYR thanks again for coming on the show tonight and we'll be talking to you again soon
6828513	6829594	Thank you so much for having me.
6829654	6829954	All right.
6829994	6830815	Take care, buddy.
6831055	6831355	All right.
6831515	6831916	Thank you.
6832656	6833057	Take care.
6833277	6833637	Bye-bye.
6835319	6837320	YYR and his games.
6837400	6848209	He's the guy behind such games like Snake 360 and now Snake 361, Falling, and now Bungie Ferret Tossing is going to be awesome.
6849290	6849911	Looking forward to that.
6850291	6850551	All right.
6850571	6852473	What did you guys think?
6852893	6853493	Isn't that great?
6853614	6855375	That's the most awesome thing ever.
6857136	6859238	Loki was convinced it was going to be Grandma's Got Guns.
6859638	6860219	I was hoping.
6860399	6862180	Maybe, but here's the thing.
6862220	6866584	If this game does really well, imagine if it's on the top of the sales board.
6866664	6871828	I think we have a responsibility to get the word out and make sure that this does top the sales charts.
6872168	6874911	Then what's going to happen is people are going to be like, wow, this game's going good.
6875211	6877993	Wow, those people at OLR are full of really good ideas.
6878273	6879995	We need to start adapting some of their other games.
6880015	6881856	We're going to have puzzle sluts.
6882256	6882837	We're going to have...
6884673	6891719	BlowShitUp, they're all on the wiki that's out there and a lot of times inspired by you guys in chat.
6891739	6896903	So somebody's updated our wiki to let them know that we've actually got a reality.
6898084	6899885	We've now had a text-based game.
6900646	6901046	We did.
6901306	6906210	It's not the first OLR-inspired game, but this is going to be the first one that you can play on a console.
6908772	6908992	What's that?
6909012	6909753	It's going to be awesome.
6909793	6910994	And it's the first one from our dream list.
6911014	6912014	It is the first one from our dream list.
6912435	6916998	So somebody does need to put patent pending YYR on that.
6917098	6917218	Yeah.
6917238	6921141	Because he has programmed it and we have said we will not sue him, right?
6921161	6922302	We're not going to sue him over that.
6922362	6924783	We think it's great that he's running with it.
6926244	6926605	Awesome.
6926785	6931428	You know, since you were mentioning games and making stuff, I thought it was kind of cool.
6931528	6933289	I actually checked out there is this –
6935504	6939625	I happen... There was a link or an article or whatever they got.
6939905	6940886	It didn't make our show roll.
6941206	6944627	It's about the new Milo Pony thing.
6944987	6946467	There's a fighting game that someone's making.
6946627	6946967	Oh, yeah.
6947027	6947567	I heard about this.
6947627	6947908	Okay.
6948128	6948368	Okay.
6948628	6954629	Well, they're using the old... It's a 2D fighter maker, I guess.
6954990	6956450	By the same people that did RPG Maker.
6956810	6957651	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6972205	6980075	Android and iOS support, so you'll be able to publish your own games, your own iPod games without any programming knowledge.
6981336	6981857	Wow.
6982518	6983218	Wouldn't that be fun?
6983799	6984260	Oh, boy.
6984620	6985902	Loki's eyes are lighting up.
6986583	6987163	All right.
6988404	6988804	Awesome.
6989504	6989764	All right.
6989804	6992305	Well, we'll keep you guys posted on that.
6992765	7003347	I just, man, I just, this show going into its 10th year next year, it's like now we have, we've won a podcast award, you know, even though it was some time ago, we've got nominated again.
7003948	7007048	We've had a PC game, a text-based adventure written on us.
7007088	7009689	And now we have like an actual like console graphical thing, like a
7011090	7015877	for lack of a better term, a legit thing you're going to be able to buy on your console that's inspired by our show.
7015957	7017118	It's just amazing.
7017258	7019101	It's like the ultimate compliment.
7019742	7020783	For real.
7021844	7022345	So excited.
7023587	7027011	Well, I don't know how we follow this with more gaming news, but that's what we're going to do.
7027131	7028113	So Loki, good luck.
7028693	7032375	All right, I'll try to make it significant.
7033015	7042200	So there's an interesting patent that Microsoft is working or has right now that points to possible Kinect-based parental controls.
7042821	7052546	And what it's going to do is it's actually going to look at your proportion, tracking your body skeleton, that kind of stuff, to figure out what age you were probably.
7053506	7055187	It's going to take a best guess, I guess.
7055207	7056048	Okay.
7057229	7083623	um neat idea i guess but i see a ton of flaws with this one uh couldn't a child simply unplug the connect and boom problem solved no need for uh parental controls whatsoever and the only way this would really work is if it's actually physically built into the console um and then the other thing is what about the short people or you know
7085146	7086167	Midgets, if you will.
7086808	7087469	What about them?
7087990	7088751	That's not good.
7089832	7091775	I don't know.
7091815	7096080	I just don't think anything's going to happen with this, but it's a neat concept, I guess.
7098038	7105324	And once again, it really comes down to are parents going to set up these parental controls in the first place?
7106505	7106885	Probably not.
7108286	7108746	That's true.
7108786	7110568	It's probably going to be more complex to set up.
7110608	7117533	But this discriminates against midgets because it's going to scan a little person and it's going to think it's a child and say, no porn for you.
7120154	7120755	That is sad.
7120835	7128802	I mean, this is one of those things that's like, I guess it's an interesting idea, but at the end of the day, it's also kind of dumb because you know what parental control you should have in your house at all times?
7129302	7129943	A parent!
7131785	7132686	It is a parent, isn't it?
7134467	7136529	Yes, it is very apparent that you should have a parent.
7137370	7137810	Ha!
7139532	7140873	Unless you were me as a child.
7141353	7142374	Alright, moving on.
7143396	7144256	I don't want to move on.
7145177	7145917	I don't have to move on.
7145937	7148338	Why do we always have to... Fine!
7148798	7149699	How about Minecraft shit?
7149719	7150759	We're just going to stop.
7151019	7151740	How's that sound?
7151980	7152960	We'll just stop.
7153080	7154901	No, we're not ready for Minecraft shit, are we?
7155221	7155481	Yes.
7155721	7156242	No, we're not.
7156262	7157482	We haven't even done Mailbag yet.
7158082	7158703	Oh, damn.
7159703	7160223	Look at you.
7160504	7161584	Look at you trying to cheat.
7161684	7164105	Hey, a reminder.
7164125	7167647	Did you see the ad for the show where every gamer has a voice?
7167727	7168287	Yeah, well...
7171360	7172200	Well, a voice.
7172461	7174361	There's no voices in a mailbag.
7174421	7175222	It's text.
7175622	7177703	You gotta leave a message if you want a voice.
7177883	7180804	I think this is a little bit too late, I think.
7180884	7181424	But I don't know.
7181444	7182405	I want to share this anyway.
7182745	7193169	But, okay, you guys heard about the whole thing where Sony and EA, they updated their terms of service so that you can't take them to a class action lawsuit anymore.
7193189	7197031	And the only way you could get out of the class action lawsuit was to send a letter.
7197751	7206611	Well, there's a website that was created called Gamers Opt Out which was basically a site that you could fill in information online and they would send it in for you.
7208197	7208677	Interesting.
7209338	7211499	So, hmm.
7211919	7219524	And I guess there was some concern at first that a legal person had registered this website, but it turned out after some investigation it's not.
7219564	7224007	It's some dude up in Michigan who's just really mad about this, like a lot of people are, really.
7224387	7225908	And it's a pretty interesting concept.
7225948	7232211	The only bummer is that Sony term of service thing happened already like six weeks ago at this point, wasn't it?
7232492	7233372	Hold on.
7234953	7238396	Yes, it happened, but that is only if you've agreed to it.
7238536	7241578	And you can only agree to it if you've updated your system.
7241658	7245020	If you haven't updated your system, you haven't made any sort of agreement yet.
7245280	7247842	I would just assume that most people have done that by now.
7247882	7251605	But I guess if you haven't, for whatever reason, then you could still use this.
7251685	7254166	Like I haven't because I haven't played my PlayStation 3 online for ever.
7258358	7259499	I think it's a neat concept.
7260920	7263522	Hey, if somebody's going to do the work for me, I'm all for it.
7263582	7270426	But at the end of the day, why does Sony get to set all the rules in regards to what you can and can't do legally?
7270646	7273908	Yes, I know there's a Supreme Court precedent and all that stuff, but I don't know.
7273928	7276010	It just kind of seems wrong.
7276110	7279852	But at the same time, what do class action lawsuits really accomplish either?
7280472	7284495	Like everybody gets a coupon or everybody gets like 50 cents.
7284595	7287377	Usually class action lawsuits don't end with much of anything.
7287992	7296040	So, that's why I'm not as mad about it, but it does kind of... It's more of a principle, I think, at the end of the day.
7296080	7305069	Yeah, and when does, you know, really, how often do you or I actually file a lawsuit against a company?
7305109	7305329	I mean...
7306089	7306349	Right.
7306609	7306989	Never.
7307529	7307809	Right.
7308070	7310370	Well, sometimes you jump in on class action lawsuits, though.
7310430	7312670	Well, yeah, but that's because you don't really have to do anything.
7312690	7314331	You're like, eh, what's the worst that's going to happen?
7314351	7317571	I'm not going to lose any money, so might as well, you know, see if I get something.
7318072	7320652	But I think that's really the only reason people jump in on this stuff.
7320712	7334535	But, I mean, I would think if Sony did something to piss me off, unless they just, you know, sold my house underneath me and, you know, took all my assets or something like that for some sort of weird clause or something that they had.
7335215	7336916	I can't see myself really suing them.
7336956	7342879	I'd just be like, well, I'm just not going to buy your next console or game or whatever, you know, that you have.
7346501	7346821	All right.
7347141	7350003	Well, we're going to move on to DarkSakura's favorite part of the show.
7350463	7352964	Let me get her properly riled up for the mailbag.
7354065	7356146	You got to see this, this picture, DarkSakura.
7357026	7358427	Miklatov, so you know who to blame.
7358547	7362429	He sent this to me from Facebook and it was labeled girls version of an Xbox.
7362489	7362869	You ready?
7362889	7362969	Yeah.
7366957	7367857	It's a picture of an oven.
7370838	7371818	She has her finger up.
7377059	7380180	I only forgive him because he introduced me to that band that I like now.
7380700	7381180	You mad?
7381740	7387722	There actually is, I never knew this, on Facebook, there actually is a page called The Girl Version of an Xbox.
7388602	7389262	That's redonk.
7390811	7391671	So, email.
7391771	7392472	First email.
7392612	7393172	Hold on.
7393192	7394232	We need your theme music.
7395013	7403936	Now that I have her properly riled up to read your emails at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com Men suck.
7404916	7406017	It's totally sexist.
7406057	7406497	I'm sorry.
7406797	7407317	It's wrong.
7408177	7408878	But really funny.
7408918	7409138	Rob.
7409498	7409698	Rob.
7409718	7409818	What?
7409858	7409998	What?
7413937	7416478	Go play your Xbox in the kitchen
7436787	7447636	Not only is the battle system fun and has really awesome summons that are actually useful, unlike Final Fantasy XIII, but the game has an emotional musical score and a storyline with compelling character cast.
7448577	7455182	I don't understand why people complain about the voice of Titus, or even the character itself.
7455322	7462568	For one thing, I love hearing his narrations and thoughts on how you go through the story, which reminds me of Kion in the Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya.
7463469	7463929	Kind of.
7464850	7487643	and for people who have a problem with the character itself he's just being realistic people he asks a lot of questions and gets emotionally stressed because one, he's in a world unknown to him and two, the other characters do keep a lot from him until later in the story and when something as important as a loved one's self-sacrifice it can take quite a toll on someone give Squaresoft a break for having a character we can somewhat relate to geez and this one's directed to me
7488263	7490744	And Jamie, I completely agree with you on Final Fantasy X too.
7491105	7495187	The game is just loads of fun and the dress spheres make it really interesting.
7495547	7507774	In all honesty, if you were a person who loved Final Fantasy Tactics with the different classes and Final Fantasy VII Active Time Battle System, then there is no reason you shouldn't have fun with this game unless you hate Charlie's Angels with all of your being.
7508254	7510776	Also, A Thousand Words is one of my favorite Final Fantasy songs.
7512096	7517420	One more note about the Final Fantasy X vs. VII remake argument that people keep on having.
7517500	7518261	Let's look at it this way.
7518681	7526226	Final Fantasy VII got a prequel, a cell phone game, a shooter, an anime, a movie, and a special edition of the movie with more scenes.
7526286	7528687	Final Fantasy X got a sequel, and that's it.
7529488	7530689	Let's spread the love around, people.
7530769	7531890	Thanks for reading, Osfer.
7531990	7532290	P.S.
7532330	7533631	Rob, did you ever finish Final Fantasy XIII?
7534827	7539231	No, I'm like in the last chapter and I never finished it because I suck.
7539431	7541213	I keep thinking about doing that too.
7541293	7544015	I really want to play XIII too, so I think I need to finish.
7544135	7546617	But at least I know I have until what, like January or February?
7547238	7550060	You want to hear something funny since I'm going to derail the show right now?
7550160	7550340	Sure.
7551682	7552782	I'm going to read a book.
7553443	7553803	What?
7554304	7554804	Yeah.
7554884	7556325	You're like me, we never read books.
7556366	7559008	What, you can read?
7559208	7561450	Anyways, that was my middle finger going up.
7562579	7562919	Wow!
7563219	7566581	So in the last five minutes, DarkSakura's finger went up, Loki's finger went up.
7566982	7569803	Now everybody in chatroom, guess, when's my finger gonna go up?
7569944	7570364	Right now.
7570504	7573226	No, it's completely appropriate.
7573246	7574366	It's Ready Player One.
7575047	7588636	It's basically kind of... The way I've... I think the story is like... It's very much like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory meets a bunch of 80s references and a bunch of sci-fi video game references.
7589036	7591378	Basically, this guy has this...
7591658	7603082	Kind of think of it like Second Life, this giant universe cyberspace that people go to and he's going to die, but he's leaving it for the person that finds this key in the thing.
7603102	7609204	And so this kid from the ghetto or whatever builds this computer and ends up trying to go in there to find the key.
7609264	7618727	So it's very much like Charlie and the Talking Factory, but there's references to all things like sci-fi and video games and stuff like they've got the
7619207	7621148	The Owl Ship from Watchmen in there.
7621268	7622109	The DeLorean.
7622149	7624490	Could they make a movie out of this?
7624510	7627351	They are making a movie out of this, I think.
7627611	7628192	It sounds cool.
7628212	7629712	That's why I'm reading it.
7629732	7633194	It sounds like part of the plot for Spiral.
7634034	7636996	My wife was very surprised that I would read a book.
7637296	7639417	And I don't read books very often.
7639497	7642559	I used to read sci-fi books in high school.
7642579	7642959	You're like me.
7643460	7645681	I used to read books all the time when I was growing up.
7645701	7647182	I used to love the scary books.
7648302	7648783	What was his name?
7648823	7649463	Christopher Pike?
7649483	7650023	Goosebumps?
7650043	7650624	Is that the guy?
7650764	7651484	No, it was different.
7651584	7652305	Well, maybe R.L.
7652325	7652645	Stine?
7652665	7653806	I want to say Pike.
7654006	7654226	Pike.
7654266	7655767	The name Pike is sticking out.
7655787	7656607	And yeah, his books.
7656627	7657648	I used to read a lot of those.
7657688	7659449	And I read some other stuff too.
7659629	7661330	You should see the book that I finished in two days.
7661630	7672207	Actually, I liked a lot of, even though I hear he was a total asshole, I liked a lot of the Roald Dahl stuff, like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Glass Elevator and James and the Giant Peach and the Boy Who Ruled the World, something like that.
7672352	7674573	Well, maybe if it's good, I will loan you the book afterwards.
7674753	7676935	After my wife reads it, because she's supposed to read it.
7677115	7681977	Well, hopefully somebody will buy me an iPad so I can play with gadgets when I read books.
7682438	7684079	By the way, it's not that I'm like, reading sucks.
7684139	7692063	It's just that the internet has kind of like, instead of reading, I pull up Wikipanion on my phone and I'm just looking at Wikipedia articles.
7692083	7693224	That's kind of what it's turned into.
7693804	7695805	My reading is now short attention span theater.
7695845	7702528	The stuff that I've actually started reading again lately is reading anthropology studies.
7704829	7708970	I've never been a fan of historical fiction, so I put down one historical fiction I was reading.
7709951	7714913	I've been reading cultural books.
7715453	7718114	The book I just finished was Geisha by Liza Dalby.
7718214	7720095	She actually worked as a geisha in the 70s.
7720895	7721776	It's her doctoral thesis.
7722856	7724657	So that's what I've been reading lately.
7724877	7727298	It's not that I hate reading, I just have a really short attention span.
7727378	7728159	But apparently it's good.
7728539	7731140	It is actually on the iOS bookstore or whatever.
7731280	7735662	It's actually on the New York Times bestsellers list right now.
7735782	7736703	Oh, okay.
7737783	7742486	If you like... Kotaku actually was the one that kind of turned me on to that.
7742806	7742966	They...
7743426	7746909	Ran an article about the book and with some screen.
7746929	7753374	It was concept art, I think, for a screenplay because he wrote a screenplay for it as well that will probably become a movie.
7754093	7755113	Well, and I was wrong.
7755254	7761236	It's not that it sounds like Spiral, it's that it sounds like the third book, Loop, in the virus, the ring, the ring, Spiral, and Loop.
7761616	7763797	It sounds kind of like Loop.
7763917	7765158	Yeah, but with video game references.
7765378	7765598	Yeah.
7766338	7766578	All right.
7766779	7767699	Let's get back to the emails.
7769460	7769840	Here we go.
7770160	7770420	Okay.
7771321	7772121	The first one's from Holly.
7772141	7773782	We got two from Holly, but they're short.
7774402	7775883	Molly says, you were forgiven, PS.
7775963	7777463	I ate your Xbox connector cables.
7778324	7778724	What is that?
7779701	7782183	It was because Loki was talking about the dog, but that was like a month ago.
7782303	7785325	Remember Loki said something about the dog's gonna die soon or something?
7785345	7786446	Well, she sent us a picture.
7786466	7786966	It was really terrible.
7787126	7788507	She sent us a picture of her dog.
7789208	7789968	Oh, I wanna see the dog.
7790428	7791249	So come on, load.
7791309	7793951	I didn't say the dog would die soon, and I hope it doesn't.
7793971	7794611	I'm just saying.
7795031	7796032	Oh, it's adorable.
7796052	7796853	Oh, it's a corgi!
7797433	7798694	Oh my god, it is adorable.
7798714	7799854	It's a freaking corgi.
7799955	7801856	Molly, I'm gonna put your dog on our Tumblr.
7802416	7804176	That is... I love corgis.
7804196	7805217	The dog's name is Molly.
7805997	7806617	I said Holly.
7806737	7807337	Oh, okay, sorry.
7807357	7808157	Her name is Molly.
7808537	7809417	The dog's name is Molly.
7809877	7810778	I was speaking to Holly.
7810838	7813058	Wait a minute, it's Holly and... Wait, wait, wait.
7813098	7814478	For real, it's Holly and Molly?
7815558	7815899	Yeah.
7818919	7820379	Molly's a good name.
7820399	7824800	That is the cutest dog ever, so shut the... Corgis are awesome.
7825020	7826761	No, if I owned a dog, I'd own a corgi.
7827161	7829081	My favorite gift ever is the army of corgis.
7831010	7832531	Oh, interesting.
7861546	7863940	Gear and not like pets and things?
7863980	7864705	That's interesting.
7865117	7869859	So like six months Sanctuary's Guard, which is a helm.
7871439	7875641	You get a personal vendor, which we've got one of those in our guild.
7877621	7879622	You get like some swords.
7879722	7886844	For 18 months you get gauntlets and greaves and Tricorn of the Drowned.
7887385	7888345	I'm going to add to it.
7888425	7889005	No, whatever.
7889665	7892646	And you get something called the Endless Skull Helm.
7893587	7894427	That's just a cool name.
7894987	7896307	So yeah, it's like basically all this stuff.
7896327	7896768	There's an end to it.
7896788	7898108	That is false advertising.
7898948	7899428	Stop.
7901189	7901909	Moving on.
7902169	7902829	Well, hold on, hold on.
7902869	7903530	Can I say this real quick?
7903810	7906611	WoW does something kind of similar with the whole like anniversary gifts.
7906731	7909191	I mean, but they're not like just for long time subscribers.
7909371	7909631	I don't know.
7910792	7915793	I got to talk about MMOs real quick though because, and I'm just going to totally publicly talk about a private conversation.
7915813	7916293	I don't even care.
7916774	7922175	Miklatov, do you know what game he got for free from some little manager thing or whatever?
7922195	7922655	Yeah.
7923196	7923916	Final Fantasy XIV.
7925016	7925256	What?
7946195	7949999	But this is Shane we're talking about and he's really good at making people do things they don't want to do.
7950159	7950840	So I don't know.
7950900	7952201	Maybe I will have to try it.
7952741	7953422	Well, hold on.
7953602	7958867	I'm just curious because it's kind of sucked and I'm wondering how much it's going for.
7959648	7961870	$25 on Amazon if I'm not mistaken.
7962091	7963412	And there's no monthly fee right now.
7964491	7964751	Really?
7965571	7966032	Oh, Loki.
7966052	7966752	Did you hear that?
7966792	7969112	Loki just went, hmm.
7969232	7969812	I can't.
7969952	7971133	I seriously, I can't even.
7971153	7972573	Nikol Tov, you might have won somebody.
7973053	7974874	I can't even fit in enough game.
7975194	7976034	This is on eBay.
7976154	7976514	Shit.
7976954	7977974	I am looking on eBay.
7978355	7979055	I'm just saying, $12.98.
7980675	7982476	Well, used.
7982516	7985416	Why would I buy a used copy of Final Fantasy XIV?
7986076	7987077	That's just stupid.
7987757	7988497	But, I mean...
7991145	7992268	Can I read the next email?
7992308	7992991	Yes, you can.
7993031	7994335	Sorry, you brought up MMOs.
7994395	7994736	I had to.
7997250	7998830	Oh, this one's to me, actually.
7999150	8000291	I saw this thought of you.
8000331	8002772	Maybe a point for discussion if things are really light this week.
8002912	8003272	Not really.
8003712	8009274	The latest top 20 list from some of those lucky people who get paid to sit around all day talking PR crap and getting paid for it.
8009614	8010354	Yes, I'm jealous.
8011014	8019077	The headlines are focusing on the top three, but I was interested by the PlayStation being placed at 13 and Nintendo reaching 16 with the Xbox not featuring.
8019537	8021158	Is the Xbox really not cool?
8021258	8022938	Apparently we don't think so in the UK.
8024199	8024279	Um...
8025740	8028624	But yeah, it's never going to stand up to the coolest levels of an Aston.
8028804	8029465	Haha, true.
8030046	8030867	Thanks, care guys.
8030927	8031408	Love your work.
8031568	8031788	Lee.
8032048	8037495	Maybe it's because they hate the United States so much and Microsoft being a US company and the other two being Japan.
8037715	8040719	These are the top 20 cool brands and yeah, the Aston Martin is number one.
8041500	8046364	Okay, so I'm just going to fly through the list in order, and I can understand these, okay?
8046884	8061755	So we have Aston Martin as number one, Apple, Harley-Davidson, Rolex, Bang & Olufsen, BlackBerry, Google, Ferrari, Nike, YouTube, Alexander McQueen, the designer, Dom Perignon, PlayStation, Ray-Ban, Chanel.
8061935	8064077	Why is PlayStation ranked higher than Chanel, fuckers?
8065458	8066699	Nintendo, Vivian Westwood.
8066719	8068020	Sometimes you're a real girl.
8073495	8084108	Agent Provocateur, Tate Modern, Maserati Maserati's are butt ugly, so yeah Aston Martin number one, Maserati should be like 42 So yeah
8086755	8087115	All right.
8087235	8088255	Dude, why?
8088495	8089156	Cool story.
8089296	8089856	Why?
8090456	8091216	Cool story, bro.
8091236	8092376	Maseratis aren't cool.
8092856	8095017	You want cool on there, put a fucking Bugatti on there.
8095177	8095857	That's what's cool.
8097017	8099078	And Chanel should be right behind Aston Martin.
8099538	8103199	Because I'm sorry, imagine decked out in Chanel driving an Aston Martin.
8105920	8106560	I don't want to do that.
8106580	8106860	With an iPad.
8107560	8108340	I'm talking me.
8110401	8110981	That would be epic.
8112393	8113514	Alright, let's move on.
8113534	8114355	Yeah, we got more emails.
8115356	8116296	Okay.
8116336	8117718	Very feminine James Bond.
8119819	8120820	Okay, this comes from Zether.
8121941	8127826	Zether is actually my new buddy now for introducing me to a different PC Engine thingy.
8128328	8136032	So I listened to episode 428 recently, and near the end DarkSakura was talking about the PC Engine and TurboGrafx-16 emulation, and mentioned Magic Engine.
8136472	8140274	I used to use Magic Engine to emulate, but later I came across an emulator that's a lot better.
8140334	8141334	It's called Ootake.
8142495	8143996	It's O-O-T-A-K-E.
8144336	8145777	And it was developed by a Japanese guy.
8145897	8153721	From what I remember hearing, Magic Engine has some input lag, which is a common hindrance in emulators, and Ootake has practically none at all.
8153981	8156142	Plus it's free as opposed to Magic Engine where you have to pay.
8156662	8159766	I'd say it's a very worthwhile emulator for the sole reason that it's free.
8160727	8164111	Also, I am with DarkSakura in hoping that Planet Harriers can get emulated.
8164672	8171680	Just recently, someone managed to get Sega's Model 3 hardware almost emulated and I hope that another genius can crack the Hikaru and emulate it too.
8172100	8172781	You were going to say something?
8173809	8174570	No, I'm sorry.
8174610	8177071	I'm just mouse being retarded.
8177772	8177952	No.
8179112	8181234	Keep being one of the best gaming podcasts out there.
8181554	8183095	I'm so glad I came across you guys.
8183135	8185536	I've been listening to past shows where you discuss Bimani stuff.
8185957	8189479	Also makes me want to pick up Step Mania again, even though I sucked at it back in high school.
8191471	8192472	Zether's my buddy now.
8193693	8196354	Okay, we have two more to go.
8197815	8200938	Hello, OLR, long-time listener, first-time writer-inner.
8202719	8206621	I know that OLR is a family, and while gaming is our main passion, we like to help people out.
8206661	8214527	Okay, this one I decided I was going to read because it's for extra life.
8215047	8215287	Okay.
8215447	8215628	Okay.
8217649	8220050	This is an opportunity for OL Army to combine the two.
8220150	8223272	Today I'm writing in to help out sick kids who don't have the lives we do.
8223773	8227295	I'll be participating in the Extra Life Gaming Marathon on October 15th.
8227775	8231818	I'll attempt to game for 24 hours to raise money for Children's Miracle Network Hospitals.
8232238	8232598	My goal is $500.
8232658	8233139	So far I'm at zero.
8235240	8235880	I need your help.
8236041	8240783	If you can please post this link into live chat forums, Twitter, Facebook, I would greatly appreciate it.
8240823	8242224	And I will be linking that shortly.
8242664	8245486	The donation is safe and 100% tax deductible.
8245926	8249668	In addition, I'll attempt to tweet my gaming process on October 15th.
8250128	8258853	Those who are interested may follow Ionotropic, that's capital I, I-O-N-O-T-R-O-P-I-C, and that's on Twitter.
8259513	8261935	I know the economy is bad and money is tight, but this is important.
8262095	8264416	Even the smallest contribution will be greatly appreciated.
8264756	8266396	Let's join together to help kids in need.
8266496	8268437	With deepest gratitude, Ionotropic.
8268557	8272858	And I will be doing the copy-paste real quick.
8274858	8282260	Yeah, I know there's actually a few people that listen to OLR because I've seen it show up on Twitter and Facebook and so forth that are doing this Extra Life thing that's coming out next weekend.
8282300	8288321	I think even Irene, who has gone by Rice Princess on this show previously, is doing this too.
8288441	8290422	So good luck to everybody participating.
8290882	8291162	You know what?
8291222	8291682	I'll do it too.
8291922	8292462	Why don't we do it too?
8293044	8293684	It's too soon.
8293864	8298687	I would like to do something for charity, but this particular one is too soon.
8298847	8300427	I can't do it on that short notice.
8300708	8305150	As much as I'd love to play video games for 24 hours, the wife would not let me.
8305210	8307651	She would take care of the baby for 24 hours.
8307751	8309872	I would happily support other people in their effort, though.
8310092	8310652	Absolutely.
8311012	8314274	As far as us, maybe on a three-day weekend at some point soon.
8314614	8315835	I would love to play a game.
8317015	8317855	Screw 24 hours.
8317915	8318856	I'd go as long as I could.
8319592	8339439	aww well maybe maybe what I'll do is I'll just play all day and for every hour that I play you're just looking for an excuse to play video games all day shut up well maybe we'll do something along the lines of whatever I happen to pull out of it I'll just send a dude cool
8341108	8341449	Good deal.
8341749	8342009	Okay.
8342990	8345793	So, moving forward, last email.
8346433	8349616	Good evening, OLR, and also guest hosts who didn't show up.
8350157	8352399	I'm being plain.
8352439	8352979	She couldn't make it.
8353300	8354641	Yeah, we ended up not having Tiara.
8355542	8355982	She couldn't make it.
8356002	8356543	Oh, that's too bad.
8356823	8356963	Yeah.
8358104	8359525	But I'll go ahead and read the email.
8359565	8361426	Gaming Week, Gears of War 3, wow.
8361566	8365329	Next week, wow, Dark Souls, Rage, Backup, Homefront, Newt, Duke, I don't know.
8366810	8367410	Why do I... What?
8369351	8370652	Like, why do we need to know you're Gaming Week?
8370732	8371192	No, I'm kidding.
8371393	8372653	Every gamer has a voice.
8373874	8375575	I was just murmuring after Dead Island.
8376916	8380318	Who do I talk to about purchasing the DDR Freak domain name?
8381639	8395597	it would feel like I would be owning a piece of the past a relic from a different time when I was younger anyways at this point all of our posts on the forum will be lost in time like tears in rain for the record probably not because I'm sure Jason still has the um
8396958	8422002	the uh forum logs that would be terrible to like troll it and just put like coming back soon and then just never ever ever update I don't see it being let go of honestly I don't see it being let go of either but let it be known if they are you've got competition because if they do put that domain up for sale I want it and I will put it to a legitimate purpose and will not um sell it spam whatever I want it absolutely
8424070	8425351	Talk to J-Dog
8448095	8463588	And the plates on my car, it still says DDRPLYR But on my newer car, 2010 Mazda MX-5 Miata Shoutout to all of OLR, Peace, and AAA I hope you have AAA if you've got a Miata shit Get some AAA!
8463648	8464409	So yeah
8467142	8467622	Alright.
8468542	8469342	Was that it for emails?
8469702	8469983	Yes!
8470203	8474903	Well, if you want to make Jamie work, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com Send us more emails for next week.
8474923	8475843	I will cut a bitch if you make me work.
8475863	8477044	And yes, we are reading emails again.
8477524	8477844	Alright.
8478904	8479644	Let's move on.
8479804	8480364	Loki!
8481624	8482185	Okay.
8482605	8485305	Loki's already trying to see if the domain's available.
8486965	8487665	I know it's not.
8487866	8490006	Somebody would have snatched it up by now if it was.
8490646	8491286	It already is.
8491766	8492046	That's right.
8492906	8495607	Anyways, so let's talk a little bit about...
8497859	8502021	Sony, and you know they have the phone brand Ericsson.
8502521	8505222	Well, they actually may be buying out Ericsson.
8506643	8507143	It's interesting.
8507163	8508624	This is coming from the Wall Street Journal.
8509324	8513886	And apparently they're going to be buying out Ericsson, the mobile phone company, I guess they teamed up with back in 2001.
8514186	8519369	And, of course, they just recently released the Xperia Play through the Ericsson line.
8521970	8523611	And, of course, they're going to have, you know...
8526022	8526762	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8539495	8566648	then basically the first thing they would do is have a Playstation phone that's actually a Playstation phone instead of just this Xperia Play or some roundabout weird name like that which people still dub it the Playstation phone but if Sony actually has their own true phone company then or phone hardware manufacturer that'd be kind of neat they'd be joining up I guess against Apple even taking them on
8567668	8568649	You know, head first.
8570810	8571410	Be interesting.
8573672	8574012	I don't know.
8575713	8576773	Has it worked for the computers?
8577274	8579555	Because the files are damn fucking expensive.
8579795	8581296	Yeah, for real.
8582935	8585097	But apples are very expensive as well.
8585637	8586498	People buy those.
8586878	8587438	That's true.
8587839	8590621	Sometimes it's about just having that status.
8592442	8596085	Well, there's a lot of games looking to be getting that same status as well.
8596145	8599467	You kind of heard YYR talk about it a little bit when he was on the phone earlier.
8599487	8602550	Sometimes it's kind of hard to get noticed and get coverage on a lot of the big sites.
8603130	8606251	Well, Activision is trying to help some indie games get exposure.
8606611	8609853	There's an indie games competition that they did before.
8610473	8618536	And I guess what happened is that the publisher is going to be doing this again, offering $250,000 to two indie developers.
8619937	8623298	Ownership of submission rights will remain with the creator.
8623338	8624959	They're very important to put that in the press release.
8625639	8649549	and um yeah there you go Activision is working with IndieCade to uh actually do the contest and it'll be open for submissions from now through December 31st that's awesome hopefully you can uh oh maybe YYR should uh submit Bungie Ferret Tossing as you know the the future of gaming all right anyhow uh DarkSakura what do you got for us
8651548	8660579	Well, as I brought up earlier when I was trying to skip doing the mailbag... Minecraft has something new in it.
8661300	8667447	There have been screenshots released from a work-in-progress version that has dragons...
8669268	8670449	Ooh, dragons.
8672609	8678471	So it's either supposed to go in there or maybe not ever.
8678631	8683752	But the creator has been tweeting that texturing the dragon was interesting.
8685973	8689413	So it looks kind of blocky like everything in Minecraft does.
8691754	8692434	Yeah, dragons.
8694035	8694315	That's it.
8695015	8695415	All right.
8695748	8696690	Thanks for watching!
8708772	8709532	My guess at least.
8711834	8715156	So this is also cool since we were talking a little bit about indie games and stuff.
8715676	8719238	OnLive is actually putting on some new indie games this fall.
8719798	8725742	And some of these actually you might recognize because they've been hitting different console platforms as well as PC.
8726562	8730064	Including Orcs Must Die, which was just released on Xbox Live Arcade.
8730284	8733386	Limbo, Magicka, Bastion.
8733986	8755622	Space Chem, and Avadon the Black Fortress and those are being added to already existing indie games that are on there including Braid, Trine, World of Goo, and The Maw so that's kind of cool that there will be kind of a showcase of all sorts of games not just you know streaming games
8758681	8759001	Awesome.
8759442	8763126	It's good that OnLive is actually getting more games because that's kind of where they're hurting right now.
8763146	8764167	You know what I mean?
8764407	8764587	Yeah.
8764887	8765728	So that's always a good thing.
8766809	8768091	Just a couple more stories for you guys.
8768111	8771274	Then we're going to go to the Twitter with twitter.com slash OLR.
8771314	8774297	I haven't seen hardly anything show up on there, so maybe after I say that it will.
8775238	8778881	Or also there's going to be the Skype line, of course, 1-877-GAME-OLR in just a moment.
8782445	8784006	I guess this is interesting.
8785147	8791752	A study was done by Website Bundle who tracks credit card spending.
8792233	8795896	I'm not exactly sure how that works, but I guess they track all the transactions or whatever.
8796597	8798818	And what the study did is that it looked at...
8799679	8800200	HUNNINGTON, NEW YORK
8815424	8816165	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8832365	8834647	Like, it's halfway between here and Fresno.
8834687	8836968	Like, what else can I say about Modesto?
8836988	8838409	Fresno's also on the list.
8838489	8839770	You know what else was on the list?
8840371	8841271	Stockton.
8841712	8842532	Was Stockton on the list?
8842892	8843553	Fresno's at number 19.
8843593	8845074	Well, it's not like they have much to do there.
8845574	8846795	Sacramento's not even on the list.
8846875	8849577	A lot of these strike me as, like, suburb-y things.
8849957	8851878	Well, then again, Pittsburgh's, like, number six.
8852379	8854460	So there are some... Chesapeake, Virginia's number four.
8855661	8858083	So there are some bigger cities that are on there.
8858123	8858483	I don't know.
8860177	8861617	Interesting, then Virginia Beach is at 10.
8862598	8863698	Aren't they right near each other?
8864058	8864398	Miami.
8864418	8864878	I think they are.
8865998	8866539	So there you go.
8866599	8867639	That's your list of games.
8867679	8869199	Oh, yeah, Stockton, number 41.
8870059	8871200	Hell, well, Stockton.
8871680	8875681	So I guess those are the big cities that buy video games probably because there's nothing else to do.
8876041	8878081	And Rama says, Huntington is Long Island.
8878121	8878421	Thank you.
8878461	8879582	Sorry, we're California kids.
8879622	8881082	We don't know our East Coast geography as well.
8881122	8882202	Huntington is Long Island.
8883803	8883963	Hmm.
8885225	8887108	Alright, one more story.
8887288	8894721	I threw this in here at the last minute because it's related to music games and DDR, which by the way, I did a little research on the DDR Freak domain.
8895061	8896263	It's registered through July 2017.
8896784	8899548	So we won't be getting that anytime soon.
8901266	8902547	That's not surprising at all, though.
8902567	8905910	I mean, that site probably still generates quite a bit of traffic, even though it's not there.
8905970	8907211	Did it ever, like, come back up?
8908132	8908332	No.
8908772	8912055	Or did the server get... I know the servers were, like, getting unplugged or whatever.
8912075	8913496	Yeah, it's not back up.
8913556	8915058	It's still just the demo part.
8915078	8917540	Oh, it just goes to... GoDaddy.
8918040	8918360	Wow.
8919001	8925126	And if you, you know, click on the register thing, then it has you go to one of those buy out a used domain theme.
8926027	8927028	So, yeah.
8927168	8928329	Was it expiring anyway?
8928909	8929510	No, I don't think so.
8932617	8933179	Interesting.
8935425	8936930	We'll have to figure out what's going on.
8941380	8942701	Look at this, you guys.
8942721	8943882	Based on true events.
8970660	8971001	Who knows?
8971121	8972284	Do you see what she's wearing right now?
8972404	8973587	I look so much better than her.
8973627	8974910	It's not even a competition.
8975010	8975892	No one can beat me.
8997694	8998834	It's nothing personal.
8999614	9001175	Super Jets DX.
9005156	9007756	This whole thing looks like it was shot in front of a green screen.
9011217	9012997	You know what that looks like to me, to be real?
9013277	9018378	This is the Ark Music Factory equivalent of movies, is what this is.
9018678	9022299	Enjoy your Rebecca Black music on your way to watch this premiere if you go.
9022419	9024419	I don't care that it's about a dance game.
9024860	9026820	It's only just kind of sad, that's all.
9029255	9047588	so um yeah that looks terrible sure does alright well is it a world premiere if no one goes to see it it's a neighborhood premiere it's a street premiere
9049116	9054079	Alright, moving on to our phone lines.
9054099	9058582	1-877-GAME-OLR is the number to call and I'm opening those up right now.
9059262	9061023	Making sure we're online and available.
9063805	9065266	I am, I'm like out of practice.
9065326	9068768	I only miss like two weeks of show and I forget how to multitask.
9069068	9069708	It's kind of sad.
9070429	9072850	Did you have this many problems when I was gone, DarkSakura?
9073131	9073271	No.
9074211	9074852	Yeah, I had a few.
9075072	9075392	Alright.
9076292	9076953	I feel better then.
9078860	9079140	All right.
9079741	9082523	We are up and available on Skype.
9082543	9083424	1-877-GAME-OLR.
9083504	9086126	Our username on Skype, of course, is Orange Lounge Radio.
9086547	9092572	In the meantime, we're going to get to some of our Twitter topics that you guys send us every week at twitter.com slash OLR.
9093173	9097316	And the first and only tweet so far comes to us from Dark Tetsuya.
9097376	9098037	Not Dark Sakura.
9098077	9098417	She's here.
9098757	9103842	Dark Tetsuya says, On the topic of DDR Freak, have you heard about this reunion tournament thing they're doing?
9104182	9106805	I hope we can show support for him somehow.
9106986	9107987	Good question.
9108147	9110710	I had heard there was supposed to be an event on 20 November.
9110830	9111691	Is that even a weekend?
9113053	9114415	That this is happening 20 November?
9116057	9116918	No, it's a Thursday.
9117579	9119821	So it would have to be like 20... Oh no, I'm looking at October.
9119881	9120923	No, 20 November is a Sunday.
9122095	9124578	I'm all for it if they do a meetup on 20 November.
9124618	9127622	But no, I haven't heard anything since the original Facebook poll.
9128002	9130265	So we need to look at Facebook and follow up on that.
9130345	9130705	I don't know.
9131106	9132067	But we'll find out.
9132287	9132988	That's a good question.
9133568	9135230	Meanwhile, let's go to the phones.
9135290	9136251	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9136271	9136572	Who's this?
9137287	9138227	It's Shane.
9138708	9139728	What's up, Shane?
9140328	9143750	I didn't know what name I was going to use, so I changed it midway.
9143870	9144550	I'm sorry.
9144590	9146391	Sometimes we call you Mikla Toph, but now you're Shane.
9146891	9147671	How about Mikla Shane?
9147691	9150052	Mikla Shane.
9150352	9150672	Nothing.
9150732	9153633	I'm just enjoying Final Fantasy XIV right now.
9153773	9155894	Did you hear us talking about that earlier?
9156054	9157895	No, because your feed sucks tonight.
9158395	9159135	It's not us.
9159235	9160216	I don't know what's going on.
9160256	9160776	We're trying.
9160796	9163137	It's all games, I know, but I'm still blaming you.
9163197	9166858	All games, you know what, they give it to us for free, so if they have an off night, I can't get to it.
9166878	9169819	Well, you can get aids for free, too, but it doesn't mean you should use it.
9170300	9170840	Shine!
9172200	9173241	Now that is a quote.
9176862	9177882	He does have a point.
9180263	9181404	You can get yours for free.
9183228	9185429	Comparing Yaris with AIDS is pretty accurate, I would say.
9185469	9189651	You can probably get Mexican labors for free, but you don't want them either.
9191172	9196074	Final Fantasy XIV you can pay $25 for, and yet now you say this is worth it.
9196355	9198436	I think you can actually get it cheaper than that, but yeah.
9198596	9199316	Alright, so fine.
9199336	9200697	You can get it on eBay or whatever.
9200757	9205219	But now you have come around on Final Fantasy XIV and you say Final Fantasy XIV is worth it.
9205618	9210879	Yes, it only took a year of them completely overhauling the game for it to be playable.
9210899	9214060	Alright, so how has this game gone from bad to good, in your opinion?
9214680	9225843	Well, I mean, it's turned into what it looked like from the get-go, a Final Fantasy XI clone, and we played that for years and years, and it...
9226503	9227804	Thank you for watching!
9244577	9246198	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9268047	9286577	nope nope they don't have a good color of blue so I went with brown but there's like eight different shades of brown so I keep starting and like oh this is good for five minutes but I need a different brown color so the game is fun huh yes does that mean they're gonna start charging for it soon
9287216	9303511	probably not because I remember reading a quote saying that they would not start charging until the game was at the point that they wanted it to be at and recently with this new patch that came out this week they said that they feel the game is only halfway to that goal
9304211	9307634	of being where they would want it to be as a playable game.
9308574	9313598	And that took a year, so I'm hoping for another year of free not paying for it every month.
9314138	9316700	And if it keeps up like that, I'll continue to play.
9317161	9328749	And maybe if I get past level five, and they got rid of the physical level, so it's only one level, your class level, no longer like class four, physical six, or something stupid like that.
9329330	9330931	So maybe if I get past level five,
9332132	9337817	I like it even more and I want to keep playing it because it is technically one of the cheaper MMOs to play monthly.
9338017	9338417	It's only like $12.
9340843	9341263	I guess.
9341323	9342784	But I mean, WoW's 15.
9343544	9345024	Most are priced in that area, right?
9345064	9346845	How much is the Star Wars MMO going to be?
9346865	9347325	Do we know yet?
9347345	9355268	15, they said, per month, unless you do the same thing WoW does, where if you pay for six months at a time, you get for a dollar cheaper per month, technically.
9355488	9355688	Right.
9355988	9356148	Gotcha.
9356168	9356808	Which isn't worth it.
9357969	9363391	By the way, for the live listeners, our feed went down, but it's back up.
9363471	9364111	And that was us.
9364211	9364971	Winamp crashed.
9365191	9365531	I don't know.
9365751	9369373	It's probably got sick of all the delay stuff that's going on on the other side.
9369533	9369853	I don't know.
9370033	9370213	Yeah.
9370512	9373874	I know, you should just let everybody call into Skype and then we could just listen that way.
9375215	9376696	Have a Skype party.
9378537	9384942	But anyway, if we're done talking about that real quick, I also wanted to mention that Tapsonic has also been taking over for me.
9385582	9392147	They updated the free songs and they added some quote-unquote American songs that are actually pretty fun to play.
9393858	9422263	uh like Passion Pit's on there Gwen Stefani's on there and then some new K-pop got added for free because I don't pay for stuff on that yet because I don't like microtransactions right and you have to pay like each time you play a song right yeah I extra don't like that that's dumb um and also Technica 3's soundtrack got leaked and it's all over YouTube and I love it is there anything I'd actually know huh is there anything I'd actually know in it
9423292	9424854	It's got Sampling Masters in it.
9426116	9426897	They do a song.
9428018	9431943	But I guess one of the people from Sampling Masters has been in the past few games and I didn't know that.
9432884	9435307	No, but they put a lot of happy hardcore in there.
9435727	9438410	Stuff I could see on one of the happy-to-be-hardcore CDs.
9438490	9439812	And it's really good and I love it.
9441750	9469064	Alright, well we're gonna let you go My keyboard lights up, I got a new keyboard and it's changing colors a lot Alright, we're gonna let you go so we can get some more calls here That's fine, I just won't be able to listen to what you guys say after this Well, we had the crash, so try again, maybe it's better now, who knows I doubt it Fine, bye Bye He's so rude He's so optimistic He really is What an ass Let's go to the phones and see if our next caller's nicer Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
9472202	9474643	Hello, hola, bienvenidos a Orange Lounge Radio.
9475043	9475503	Who's this?
9475883	9477043	Stand in the silence.
9477083	9477463	Hang up.
9477523	9478524	It was a crank caller.
9479424	9481064	I guess they knew their connection wasn't working.
9481104	9482065	I don't know.
9482085	9485406	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9486946	9488586	And in the meantime, I'll try to go back to Twitter.
9489387	9491407	Except I closed Firefox like a genius.
9492727	9493288	Genius.
9493428	9498089	I guess we could have kept Shane on to, you know, be optimistic about things a little more.
9500970	9501890	I like Shane.
9503502	9504883	I like him when he's appropriate.
9504923	9505544	No, I'm just kidding.
9505564	9509048	I guess his inappropriateness is part of what makes him Shane, right?
9510249	9510449	Yep.
9510589	9512771	Yes, and you take your friends as they are.
9512791	9514733	I guess.
9514753	9516915	Or you murder them in their sleep.
9517055	9518237	I mean, you take them as they are.
9519642	9525105	Alright, let's go to our Twitter topics, because I know we have at least a couple more coming in here.
9525925	9527466	TigerClaw sent us some tweets.
9528226	9532649	Take down notice against some Battlestar Galactica modders.
9532689	9534449	This is a tweet to us from TigerClaw.
9538271	9566404	uh let's see a Battlestar Galactica mod for Nexus and I guess this uh made the attention of NBC Universal who sent a cease and desist letter to ModDB who'd been hosting the work on it I don't even wow I don't even know what this is about here uh but of course there is already a Battlestar Galactica online game um so I'm sure this is definitely a conflict of interest when you put Battlestar Galactica into uh another game
9568154	9595705	well it's also you know if you're doing a mod that's like with licensed properties and stuff like that I mean that's kind of to be expected if you know if you're doing your own mod or something like that you know and that's a little different by the way this game had to remove everything that was related to Battlestar Galactica so not just the popular one so bummer alright let's see also hold on
9597731	9598551	Why are you calling back?
9600351	9600792	I don't know.
9600852	9602192	You didn't have any other callers.
9602212	9604972	I felt like I should fill time.
9606252	9608233	I just was slow in getting the Twitter loaded.
9609053	9609853	I don't think so.
9610573	9611093	No, yes, I was.
9611113	9613494	That's not what it sounded like because I had the feed up and running.
9614194	9615434	Was the feed working now?
9615454	9616054	Nobody was calling.
9616834	9617734	Yeah, the feed was back.
9617854	9619015	Well, then there you go.
9620615	9621635	Yeah, so I called.
9621955	9623955	So Battlestar Galactica cease and desist.
9624055	9625836	I love Battlestar Galactica.
9625856	9626816	I can talk about that.
9629104	9630566	It has nothing to do with the story.
9630606	9631667	Did you even hear the story?
9632288	9632628	Yes.
9633529	9634530	Okay, what was the story?
9635772	9639736	NVC made them shut down some mod for some game that nobody plays.
9639916	9640417	Okay, good job.
9640437	9641098	You passed the test.
9644423	9647124	So are you sad that they had to take down the mods?
9647384	9650124	If you love Battlestar Galactica so much, here's my real question.
9650144	9651845	If you love it so much, why aren't you playing the MMO?
9652425	9654165	I did for a day and it was terrible.
9654345	9654665	Really?
9654705	9656165	So I didn't play it anymore.
9656766	9657646	Why was it terrible?
9658206	9660046	I couldn't control my Cylon ship.
9661147	9663887	And I was like, this isn't realistic at all.
9664327	9669888	I'd be making out with Helo or something equally as awesome.
9670088	9672569	That's absolutely realistic, I'm sure.
9673482	9698000	and Battlestar Galactica it would be because he loves Cylons and I was a Cylon alright alright, I'm hanging up on you to get some other calls, you've tied up the line okay, if there are finally people calling, that's fine bye, 1877 game OLR, or use name on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio so Miklatov's gone and we do have another call coming in, so let's see hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
9698841	9702304	oh, it's Legend of Zaku hey, Legend of Zaku, how you doing?
9703044	9703464	Pretty good.
9703484	9706605	Been doing stressful at work, but, you know, been hanging in there.
9707205	9707525	I hear you.
9707545	9708025	As usual.
9708145	9709326	It's been stressful at my work, too.
9709346	9710046	What's on your mind, buddy?
9711646	9729491	Just the usual, you know, grasp of the fact that even though Steve Jobs did pass away, it's like his legacy in terms of how he's actually laid out a plan that might actually impact the way we view, you know, any, like, portable, dedicated gaming systems.
9730011	9731792	I'm just saying the fact that, you know,
9732748	9735971	His passing has pretty much, you know, given me a little bit of time to reflect that.
9736091	9745800	Mobile gaming might actually, you know, unless Nintendo gets into the business of selling phones, well, Sony's getting there, getting there, as long as they buy out Ericsson, then they'll be set.
9746400	9751085	But I'm more concerned about Nintendo and the fact that they just, like, shrug it off with a cavalier attitude.
9751505	9757130	If Nintendo, you know, started selling phones, then they would have to acknowledge the fact that there's online and, well...
9759046	9780244	and this is where these mobile game developers they target that audience where they're basically pissing in the same pool that Nintendo has spent hard cultivating ever since the days of the Game Boy but the idea is that they're going after the casuals I know it's a segment of the market that's like
9782232	9788319	It's really hard to break in because these are people who aren't like, they're just typical folks.
9788339	9790842	They're not like your average gamer.
9791163	9796749	But the idea is that Nintendo, they're just shrugging it off.
9797450	9800173	And they're being so naive about not adapting.
9800794	9806205	Like, not realizing that the guys, you know, the creators of Angry Birds, at the end of the day, they're still going to make bank.
9806986	9810232	While Nintendo's going to be scratching their head as to why they're not innovating.
9810493	9811816	Why they're not staying ahead of the curve.
9814019	9815640	But the Wii U!
9815680	9817601	The Wii U is innovative!
9817661	9819242	The Wii U, it's about you!
9819703	9820643	And it's innovation.
9820684	9821044	You!
9821184	9822285	It's got the letter U!
9822465	9832232	Just a Wii with a touch remote and supposed better graphics even though it's still being worked out Hold on, Zaku, hold on.
9832852	9833352	Hold that thought.
9833392	9834373	There's something really important.
9834413	9834974	I hate to interrupt.
9835014	9838296	DarkSakura, what are you really reading about Final Fantasy XIV over there?
9839119	9840279	Yeah, I was just curious.
9841380	9841880	Oh, dear.
9842220	9843160	It doesn't mean I'm going to play it.
9843200	9843780	I was just looking.
9844920	9845941	You were experimenting?
9846141	9848241	Did I catch you experimenting in the middle of the show?
9848261	9849242	No, I was just looking.
9849422	9849762	Shit.
9851122	9852002	I had to give you crap.
9852422	9852722	All right.
9853163	9855283	Sorry, Zanku.
9855343	9863405	If Nintendo were serious about trying to capture the casuals, they wouldn't have an arrogant tone.
9868004	9870726	That's what I hear from their bosses.
9871066	9877551	They're hating on the Angry Birds folks, the indie devs.
9878291	9883575	Because at the end of the day, they're going to be pissed when their lunch gets eaten by those guys.
9883955	9887057	Steve Jobs' impact is going to be felt for a long time.
9887177	9890559	You were mentioning about his style a little bit there at the beginning of the call.
9890840	9896524	Did you hear that news report about that they're going to have executives be taught on his styles?
9897364	9898124	Well, that's the thing.
9898164	9906546	You can't really teach anyone else that type of style because you're born with that ability to be a perfectionist.
9907666	9912748	You can't really teach an artist, especially one that's born into it, born with that talent.
9912788	9923010	I mean, sure, they can become artists and they grow to realize that they have the talent within them, but you can't just force that person to be a perfectionist, to be as meticulous as he was.
9923630	9925191	I feel bad for that new guy a little bit.
9925211	9932397	The fact that he managed to change my industry, which I actually do work in mobile.
9932617	9939362	The day the iPhone came out, I realized that history was changing with that very same bloke.
9940223	9941244	Who would have ever thought that
9941974	9942394	DarkSakura.com
9961921	9966282	His first big press conference is about the iPhone 4S, which is really more of an upgrade.
9966302	9967102	Yeah, that was shocking.
9967142	9972464	The fact that they couldn't even announce something greater than the iPhone 4.
9972524	9973684	Well, here's the problem.
9973744	9974444	It is what it is.
9974624	9977905	If Jobs had still been around, that would have been his announcement to make anyway.
9978025	9978565	But think about this.
9978965	9979486	He knew.
9979786	9984727	Tim Cook had to know when he was up on that stage that the former CEO was... I mean, he knew.
9984967	9986127	I'm sure he was being up there.
9986727	9988288	He knew that Steve Jobs was about to die.
9989249	9993195	Well, that was already known the day he stepped down.
9993255	9994838	And that was months ago.
9994858	9998483	But I'm talking the difference between in a couple months and today or tomorrow.
10000441	10010728	But the idea is that he paved the way in the fact that mobile gaming has exploded in the past four to five years.
10011228	10018974	It used to be a small niche market that only folks who had the money to pay for those shitty games for those devices back then.
10019014	10025858	But now it's like the quality is getting to the point where it might even rival whatever Sony and Nintendo is actually spitting out.
10026619	10029061	I mean, if you look at the fact that these phones are like...
10029841	10054789	it's cheaper than the Vita itself they start cheaper than the Vita and they have just about the same number of games and the fact that the quality is damn near almost PS2 level for a device no greater than 4 inches yeah that's pretty impressive alright Zach I gotta let you go so we can wrap up but thank you for your call
10055939	10056860	Take care, buddy.
10057380	10057600	Bye.
10073698	10075979	Alright, that's going to do it for calls tonight.
10076019	10078860	Sorry to those that didn't get through, but be sure to send us an email for next week.
10078900	10082301	Mailbag at orangelaundry.com Or you could always send us a tweet.
10082381	10088783	Twitter.com slash OLR I want to quickly, quickly read one more tweet here from TigerClaw because I didn't get to this.
10089544	10101668	He sent a story from Gamasutra about this is kind of a longer article, but I guess the headline is Game Developer Conference Online WebWise Kids Team for Game Promoting Online Child Safety
10102228	10108091	So Webwise Kids is the game, or no, is the company, and I guess they're just promoting children being safe online.
10108251	10111893	I would assume like not sharing, oversharing personal details and so forth.
10113074	10114895	There is a free title that the saying is out there.
10114935	10122038	It's called Passing the Ball, and it's an action game that follows a parent and their child as they learn an important lesson about working together.
10122098	10128582	I guess that would be passing a ball, which to me sounds a lot like you jump to a conclusion.
10133114	10140539	There is a donation link within Passing the Ball so you can make a donation to Webwise Kids.
10141740	10145342	They will be doing something with the Game Developers Conference event in San Francisco.
10146102	10152006	The initiative will include a one-day Gamers for Change event created by the same non-profit team.
10152786	10167393	In addition to commissioning the game for web-wide kids and adding the donate link to the game, $1,000 was directly donated to this network to help the programs to promote a culture of safety, responsibility, and respect for youth and families in the digital world.
10168573	10177637	Again, watch your damn kids and make sure if they have a Facebook, A, they ought to be at least like 13 or 14, but B, if they aren't, you're monitoring it.
10177677	10178938	You know exactly what they're doing.
10179038	10180098	I have heard of really young kids.
10180118	10181059	Permanently blind them.
10181639	10191528	I have, well, I have heard about really young kids with Facebook accounts mostly to play the games, which is fine as long as the parent is kind of, you know, has, has watching out of the corner of their eye, you know, what they're doing.
10191588	10193710	Although I think... They should be standing there looking over their shoulder.
10194488	10196189	Well, yes and no.
10196710	10198391	I mean, you can't put the child on it.
10198491	10200353	I mean, at the end of the day, it's up to the parent.
10200373	10200793	That's fine.
10201274	10204797	But I think, and sometimes you should sit there and play the game with them.
10204857	10207819	But maybe there's times where you kind of get it loaded for them.
10207839	10209581	And then you can walk away for a couple minutes.
10209961	10211762	Give that child a sense of safety or whatever.
10211823	10214064	Make sure that when you walk back, that's what they're still doing.
10214965	10215325	You know.
10215886	10216707	Porn friends.
10217407	10217948	Pornville.
10218348	10219169	Not Pornville.
10220049	10220510	Forget it.
10221491	10221871	All right.
10223854	10224355	There you go.
10224455	10226837	That's going to do it for another week here at Orange Lounge Radio.
10226897	10229640	Oh, but I did miss one little thing we got to do.
10229740	10231082	Thank you, Loki, for pointing this out.
10231122	10232123	I totally missed this earlier.
10232223	10232703	What can I say?
10232723	10233484	I'm out of practice.
10234185	10235887	So it's time for the FUs of the week.
10252000	10255085	F you to people who don't do their damn part.
10256386	10256747	That's it.
10262711	10290696	Firewall at work that doesn't allow us to play live very well because of our strict NAT settings and it's funny our IT guy actually opened the NAT ports for my system made it worse so that's great fortunately they're going to be installing a new firewall in a couple weeks and if that doesn't work he's going to put our systems outside the firewall so that hopefully that won't be a problem
10292276	10294058	Alright, FU to Headaches.
10294238	10297162	I've been getting some huge ones today and it's not been good.
10297402	10298744	I'm very sad.
10299765	10303710	But I did really wear myself out yesterday so that could be part of the reason why.
10304491	10305852	So, I don't know.
10306813	10307875	That's it for the FU's of the week.
10309076	10310537	Now we can start to wrap up the show.
10311017	10315618	Actually, I gotta ask Loki, do you have any last minute stories for us?
10315778	10316018	No?
10316898	10317799	I'm not gonna look anything up.
10318179	10318439	Fine.
10319239	10321180	Then we'll go around and get everybody's final thought.
10321740	10322480	Loki, we'll start with you.
10323100	10330303	My final thought is opening on the 12th, we'll be voting for the podcast awards.
10330503	10331843	So don't forget to vote every day.
10332663	10333264	Every single day.
10333324	10334004	Tell your friends.
10336045	10336665	Tell your enemies.
10337166	10339268	Just make sure you vote every single day.
10339548	10340869	And especially tell your frenemies.
10341650	10343231	Yes.
10343411	10345152	My final thought is tacos.
10346613	10349676	If we win the podcast award, we will celebrate with a taco party.
10349736	10350316	That's for sure.
10352118	10352378	Shit.
10353179	10354780	Is that your final thought tonight, DarkSakura?
10354800	10355981	Yeah, that's my final thought.
10357362	10357923	Fuck shit.
10360734	10361354	That's it.
10361455	10362675	Have a wonderful night everybody.
10362735	10365998	Thanks for tuning in and supporting Orange Launch Radio as you always do.
10366118	10367799	Hey, if you like the show, always ask.
10367879	10368820	Tell a friend about the show.
10368860	10369520	Help spread the word.
10369540	10371021	Remember guys, we don't have advertising dollars.
10371361	10382189	It's part of the reason that we were hoping we'd get nominated for the podcast award is because it's great exposure and we don't have a big magazine or a giant website that backs us up.
10382569	10385751	So thanks again as always for your help in helping us spread the word.
10386191	10387072	So we'll see you next week.
10387112	10389334	We'll do it all again with another week of Orange Launch Radio.
10389374	10389814	Until then...
