00:07.000 --> 00:08.000
Who's your hosts?

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
DarkSakura

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
Sky and the Low Crew

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
Tonight, October 16th, 2011

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
Street Fighter X Tekken gets a release date

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
has Sony Playstation Network information been compromised again

00:22.000 --> 00:26.000
and a date is set for the new Xbox Dashboard

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
and welcome back to another week of the show

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
where every gamer has a voice

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
It is episode number 432

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
for this October 16th, 2011

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
My name is Rob Roberts

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
and I'll be joining you over the next few hours

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
with my awesome co-hosts

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
First off, the one and the only DarkSakura

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
Jamie Summers

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
Hi

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
How are you Miss Summers?

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
Caffeinated

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
Mildly caffeinated

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
as opposed to extremely caffeinated

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
Yeah, because I had to decaf coffee

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
but there's some caffeine in it

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
Yes, a little bit

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
It's decaffeinated but not uncaffeinated

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
Enough to bounce the headache

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
Say hello as well to tech master Loki

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
Hello

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
Who I notice has brought dinner of choice tonight

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
an entire pizza

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
Is this triple bacon? Quadruple bacon?

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
Triple bacon with Red Bull

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
What a very nerd powered dinner

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
I love it

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
Alright, we do tape live every Sunday night

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at All Games Radio

01:28.000 --> 01:32.000
www.allgames.com

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
Join us in our chat room if you are listening live

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
chat.orangelaunchradio.com

01:36.000 --> 01:40.000
After all, we are the show where every gamer has a voice

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
By the way, speaking of Bobby

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
who comes on, of course, before us live every week

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
he had a great interview tonight

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
and if you don't listen to his show

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
you really should check it out

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
go look at it on iTunes or whatever

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
because he had an interview with some of the famous voices at Valve

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
including Dark Soccer, one of your favorites

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
GLaDOS was on the show tonight

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
so it was a fun listen

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
so I guess he ran into them at an Atlanta based convention

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
Does that mean he's going to have new bumpers?

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
I would think so

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
I would hope so man

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
He's not going to have new bumpers because of that

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
I hope he did get something out of that

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
He better

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
Can you record a bumper for my show?

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
What I liked

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
I will be 100% honest

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
I didn't hear the entire interview

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
because we used Bobby's time to get some set up

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
and some stuff of our own done

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
but I heard about half of it

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
and one of the questions that I liked was that

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
he asked them if they'd heard the

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
commercial for the iPhone 4s

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
that had GLaDOS' voice over it

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
we played it on the show last week

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
and he had heard

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
because they're a husband and wife

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
and the husband had heard it, but she hadn't

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
but he was trying to explain it to her

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
and it was kind of funny

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
He had that voice modulation program

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
because that was dead on

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
I'm sure it's doable in Adobe Audition

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
not too difficult

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
He'd probably just Google GLaDOS Adobe Audition

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
I don't know, probably a way to do it

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
Bobby, by the way, is in our chat

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
He says two new bumpers

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
Not one, but two

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
Alright

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
Let's see what else is going on

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
in our worlds today

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
I want to mention this

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
Usually we have a little chatter here at the top of the show

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
before we get into our gaming weeks

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
and I was specifically asked

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
to mention this to you, Loki, tonight

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
I've been waiting to tell you about this

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
Miklotov gave me a call about

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
two hours before we went live tonight

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
and he works in gaming retail

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
and he sells video games

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
He wanted me to tell you about

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
a game that came out today

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
Skylander Spyro Adventure

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
I saw the ads for that on YouTube

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
Apparently

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
if you've been listening to the show for a few weeks

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
I know Loki is a huge fan

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
I love it

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
Alright, quickly reiterate for us

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
What is this game and why do you hate it?

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
This game is basically

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
everything that's wrong about Activision

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
all lumped up into one game

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
It's basically Activision taking

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
Spyro, a franchise that was beloved

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
years ago

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
turning it on its edge and basically

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
making it this thing where

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
instead of having download content for the game

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
you're going to have actual physical

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
add-ons that you buy

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
as in the little

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
I wouldn't even call them toys or figurines

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
that interact with this thing they call a portal

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
so you basically stick these little figurines

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
on this little portal device and you get to play

04:25.000 --> 04:47.000
I'm playing this trailer here that I'm not exactly sure what I'm going to see here because I know very little about this game but I guess this is something like

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
I would buy that for a child

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
That's more like a morning star

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
It's a character

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
It's basically a character

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
You get these characters

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
that you can play as

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
It comes with three including Spyro

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
Spyro by the way looks like he's

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
extremely angsty and emo now

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
He's just ridiculous

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
Doesn't look anything like the old Spyro

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
It's just basically a platform hack and slash game

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
but the game requires you

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
to switch between these different types

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
of characters based on different elemental

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
powers that they have

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
so like fire characters can't go underwater

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
and vice versa

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
so you have to keep switching characters

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
in order to finish parts of the game

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
but there's thirty fucking characters that you can buy

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
for this and might I add

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
they're all eight dollars

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
can you imagine if DLC out there

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
for your favorite game and hell

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
even Marvel vs. Capcom 3

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
which had really expensive DLC

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
it was like five bucks a character

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
I think

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
eight dollars for each individual character

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
or you can get like a three pack I think

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
maybe twenty bucks or something like that

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
it's just, it's ridiculous

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
but they're aiming this at

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
kids because they did really well with

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
their stupid toy titles like

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
Zuzu Pets and

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
Squinkies and they have a whole

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
bunch of them coming out this November

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
but I hate it because one

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
it's difficult

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
to sell

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
kind of on the back side you don't really see any of this

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
but the way they had us set

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
up the items and

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
buy it and stuff is retarded

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
and um

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
honestly this looks like another Tony Hawk

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
ride or you know

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
something like that

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
it's just, it's a peripheral game

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
that's just not going to work and on top of that

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
you know because they're really trying to attract everybody

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
it's eighty dollars to buy

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
it on any platform

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
including 3DS, eighty dollars

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
well Mieglatov

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
wanted me to tell you it's selling

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
like crazy

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
apparently they are already sold out

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
of all, like it just came out today I think

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
they're already sold out of it on like every

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
platform but the Wii, most of the

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
characters are already gone, it's selling

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
like crazy apparently

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
well fantastic

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
and I know that was my reaction

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
too I was like great, that means

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
it's going to end up maybe, maybe

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
still too early to tell being the must have toy

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
this Christmas, oh well they've already, they're already

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
in bed with Toys R Us and they

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
worked a deal with them where they get an

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
exclusive three character pack for

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
you know that title being placed on their

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
hot fifteen toy

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
titles of the holiday, so yeah

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
that list is trusting

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
whatever, you know what

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
cool, if it does well for them

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
awesome, but I just

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
I've asked first off

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
how many did they bring in because

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
you know, selling out, trust me

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
with the quantities that my

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
customers are buying, selling out

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
wouldn't be that many titles

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
alright, I've got to go to our chatroom

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
at chat.orangelaunchy.com, after all we are the

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
show where every gamer has a voice and not every gamer

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
necessarily agrees, going to our chat

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
rooms, ShadowNextGen says

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
Skylander Spyro Adventure is the first good

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
Spyro game in a while, I'm reviewing it right

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
now and it's a lot of fun

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
you can beat the new Spyro game

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
with the three included characters

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
you are not required to buy anything else

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
and he also says

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
Spyro is seventy dollars not eighty dollars

08:07.000 --> 08:11.000
sixty nine ninety nine

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
you're wrong Loki, you're very

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
wrong, oh I'm sorry

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
alright

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
and DarkTetsuya says I'd be willing

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
to bet that it sells a million copies

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
invoking an old

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
OLR joke from yesteryear

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
so there you go

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
I don't know, like that little clip

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
I looked at didn't look terrible but

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
I can see where

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
especially on the back end point

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
it's probably really annoying where you have

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
like all these different peripherals

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
that are going out there for this game

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
I'm sure this is very uninteresting but let me tell you

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
how they have it so that you have to order this

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
yes please start off our show tonight with something completely

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
uninteresting, ok well anyways

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
so they sell these twelve characters

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
this is their first wave of characters that they have

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
out right now, ok so twelve

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
different SKUs that you have

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
but then there's this generic

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
SKU that represents the full case

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
but you have to order that generic

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
SKU by how many characters you want

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
so it comes twelve to

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
a case, so you have to order twelve

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
so it makes it look like, in our system

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
that you're receiving twelve cases

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
instead of one case with twelve characters

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
in it, because it's fucking back asswords

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
so

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
I just, I hate that

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
so it sounds like a lot of your frustration with this game

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
really has nothing to do with the game itself

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
it looks terrible, ok, they showed it to me

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
they showed it to me, I actually got to

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
play a little bit of the Wii version

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
and I was just unimpressed, I was just like

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
big fucking whoop, oh good

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
why do I need this stupid portal thing

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
why couldn't this have easily been done

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
in game without any of these extra characters

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
oh I know why, because Activision

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
wants to get in the toy business, because they think

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
hey, if we can convince stupid parents to

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
buy these eight dollar pieces of crap

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
for their kids

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
then we're in the money

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
to be fair, it's a good idea

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
I mean isn't that every Christmas

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
trying to convince parents to buy an eight dollar piece of

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
crap for their kids? Yeah, pretty much

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
but I'm just saying

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
you're a parent now, would you consider

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
buying it? No, I would not

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
you already knew what I was gonna ask

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
I would not, and you know why? Because it's not a fucking toy

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
a toy does something

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
a toy would be something that you could play with

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
outside of the game, like

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
ok, if they were action figures or something

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
like that, like a GI Joe

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
or Ninja Turtles or whatever, they actually moved

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
did something, then that's fine

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
then that's cool if they, you know, worked with the game

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
and you could play with them outside of it

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
I could see that worth eight dollars, but they don't do anything

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
will Josh only be allowed to play with toys

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
from the 80's? No, he will not

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
be allowed to just play with toys from the 80's

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
but I'm just, I'm not gonna buy him something

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
that doesn't, like

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
a statue that has no articulation

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
ok, maybe a little bit of

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
articulation with these, I don't really know if

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
maybe their arms move a little bit, but

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
they're stuck to a base

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
and

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
yeah, I know, you know, back in the days

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
you know, there was the green plastic

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
army men, and those were also stuck to a base

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
but you know what, they weren't fucking seventy dollars

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
either

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
or eight dollars

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
alright, is he allowed to have, uh, Tron

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
toys? Cause maybe I'll, uh

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
well he's probably too young right now, but maybe in a couple years

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
right now he just likes books

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
he likes books, he likes books

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
uh, we, uh, brought down

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
out of the attic, uh, Teddy Ruxpin

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
and uh, Grubby

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
and um, I actually, we popped

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
in a tape last night, man, it still

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
works? It still works! Wow!

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
Oh, it's, it's in great condition

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
I kept that in great condition, and we also have

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
Grubby, and I just had to find a

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
cable to run to, uh

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
it just needs an audio cable so that they both

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
talk, but he thought it was cool for a few

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
minutes, and then he went and

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
I don't know, was trying to steal

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
the iPod. Well, a kid his age

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
is supposed to have a short detention span, that's what happens

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
but yeah, I still, you know what

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
despite the fact that they sold well

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
in Miklotov's store, I still hope

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
it fails. Why?

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
Because I, I hate Activision and their

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
experiments to try to capitalize on

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
I mean, seriously, they're trying to run

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
this franchise into the ground, they've already tried

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
with a few games already, and

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
now it's just like, whoring this thing out

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
it's Spyro and friends, I mean

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
take Spyro out of it

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
I mean, seriously, just take him

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
out of it, I mean, he's not a draw anymore to these

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
games. I, I do want to move on past the subject

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
but I gotta say this one other comment from Shadow

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
Next Gen in our chatroom at chat.com

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
because I gotta say this does sound pretty cool

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
Shadow Next Gen says, Skylanders

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
Spyro's adventure is also cross-console

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
kids who have a 360 can bring the character

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
to their friend's house and play on the Wii version

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
with all the progress that they had on the 360

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
version, and I gotta admit, that sounds kinda cool

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
Loki's giving me a

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
blank stare, he doesn't care

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
I don't care, I really

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
don't. Alright,

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
fine, alright, and Tigerclaw

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
suggests, put a tape of OLR recorded

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
on it and watch Teddy Ruxpin talk

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
like everyone. I don't know if

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
daddy would necessarily want

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
Josh hearing him, some of the rants

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
he does on this program. And also

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
I don't fucking have a tape recorder anymore

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
so how would I do that?

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
I mean, seriously, I'd have to go to my

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
sister's house and she has

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
my old, like, stereo system

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
I think it has a tape player, I'm not sure if it works

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
anymore because that's usually the first thing to break

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
I actually, I had a huge old

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
boombox when I moved this last time

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
that had tape recorders in it and everything

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
I fucking threw it away

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
like, I didn't even try to sell it on

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
Craig's system, I can't. She uses it for like

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
a little, you know, cheap ass surround sound

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
system or whatever, but you know, those

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
the tape recorders are always the first things that break

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
on those, it's like the door falls off

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
or, you know, just something doesn't work

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
it eats tapes, you know

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
I saw a great

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
picture on Facebook

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
earlier in the week, or maybe it was last week

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
it had a little picture of a cassette tape

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
pencil and it said, if you don't know what

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
these two items have in common

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
then you're too young

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
thought it was funny

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
it was an old people joke, alright

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
moving on

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
not so light-hearted news, in fact this is

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
kind of sad, and it sucks that I'm having

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
to do a eulogy two weeks in a row

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
but that's just unfortunately the tech world

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
has lost a lot of great people in the past couple weeks

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
and this week we lost Dennis Ritchie

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
and you may not recognize

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
the name as readily as you might

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
say Steve Jobs, who we were talking about last week

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
but Dennis Ritchie

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
obviously had a direct impact

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
on pretty much everything

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
in the video game world. Why?

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
Well, if you didn't know, he only

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
like wrote the C programming

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
language

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
that's kind of important because like

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
every programming language out there is

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
just about, anyway, like some type of

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
derivative

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
derivative, thank you

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
I don't know why the words gave me, of C

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
so I even learned

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
a little bit of C++ when I was in college

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
I actually originally studied to be a computer programmer

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
but

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
it wasn't really free

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
it worked out terribly and I actually

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
this is the ironic thing, I actually blame my teacher

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
I had a horrible, horrible

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
professor and I don't think

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
I went to a very good university either

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
you know

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
and granted there was some things going on in my personal life

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
I can't scapegoat everything, a lot of it is

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
my fault too, but let's

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
be real, computer science was just not for me

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
ironically what do I end up doing now for a living

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
not this show, that's not my day job

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
trust me, but the job I had that pays

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
the bills, I'm a teacher

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
in a corporate environment so I teach

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
adults much like the professor did so it's

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
just kind of ironic that that's where I ended up

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
but anyway

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
I don't want to get too far away from the topic at hand

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
obviously we have to tip the hat to Dennis Ritchie

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
who created C programming language

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
also was a

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
co-creator of the Unix operating

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
system, which is a huge deal

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
he passed away this week at 70

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
years old, CAUSE is

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
undisclosed at this time

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
so

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
I think we're ready to move on to our gaming week

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
I think CAUSE was sadness from hearing that Skylanders

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
is coming out, stop it, stop it right

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
now, it's terrible, don't joke, alright

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
moving on, Dark Sakura

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
how was your gaming week?

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
I played stuff other than WoW

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
oh my god, congratulations

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
everybody give Dark Sakura a round of applause

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
yay, woo

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
well when you came in I was playing Castlevania Symphony of the Night

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
because we finally got it working on the system

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
you sure were

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
and of course I was screaming because

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
dammit it's not, you know, playing it on the Playstation

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
and I walked in the house and I said

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
what is a man? and I threw a glass on the ground

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
and Dan got very angry

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
especially since it was our glass

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
and I called him a miserable

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
little pile of secrets

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
he just said, bitch, clean that up

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
pretty much, yeah

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
we also played

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
Guardian Heroes today, we got the demo

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
and then Dan proceeded to go

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
wait I want to play Radiant Silvergun

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
and decided to play Radiant Silvergun and the demo was like

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
half a level, it's not even

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
worth

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
doing, at least, you know, the first

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
stage is what you can play in Guardian Heroes

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
so

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
we kind of got our Saturn

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
on, I guess, on the Xbox

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
and then he played through a whole bunch of After Burner Climax

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
and that was it

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
good times, so it sounds like you had an Xbox Live arcade party

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
kind of, yeah

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
kind of, yeah, alright, moving on, Loki

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
how was your gaming week?

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
um, playing more Grand Theft Auto

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
and um

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
I'm playing Earth Defense Force

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
this week, more Dead Rising 2

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
off the record though, are you feeling okay?

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
no, I just didn't get

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
around to playing more

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
Earth Defense Force because I was

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
playing Dead Rising off the record

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
and it's alright, it's

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
you know, I know a lot of the

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
complaints that other people have because I didn't really

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
play through Dead Rising 2

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
playing through sandbox mode, it's kind of relaxing

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
actually, although I still don't

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
understand why zombies are easily

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
killed by guns

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
but people are not

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
for some reason, there is like

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
it was great because there was a part in the sandbox

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
mode where this bride's like, help, help

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
so you go up to her and then she starts shooting with

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
a gun, so I pull out

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
a shotgun, you know, because what wins in a gunfight?

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
a bigger gun

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
so the shotgun

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
to a zombie will literally cut it in half

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
it will just sever the body

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
in half and make it explode

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
whereas this woman, who is

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
a bride, can take like eight

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
rounds of a shotgun to the face

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
that doesn't make

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
any sense to me, out of all

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
the game, I mean, completely unrealistic whatsoever

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
I just don't get it, why are the crazies

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
you know, more armored than

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
zombies? I think, granted, the zombies

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
are dead already, but

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
I mean, shit, it should only take a couple

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
of shotgun rounds, and I understand you want to make it

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
difficult because they're like boss characters

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
or whatever, but

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
I don't know, just put more of them on

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
the screen or something

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
but it's a fun game

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
my character is currently dressed up like a cowboy now

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
because I'm still

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
going through every single piece of clothing I find

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
I pick it up

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
is this the game that has the protoman costume I was

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
reading about this week too?

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
even though Capcom hates

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
Mega Man

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
that's why it's protoman, not Mega Man

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
oh, touche

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
alright, well if that's it for your gaming week

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
my gaming week was a lot of

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
games you would not be expecting me to play

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
I played a demo

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
I hate basing

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
my assumptions of games off the demo

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
but let's be real, it's what a lot of us are doing

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
in this day and age of digital download

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
and I downloaded the demo for a game

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
I was interested in at first because I love

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
this series, Burnout Crash

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
is the game I downloaded

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
and I like Burnout an awful lot, the whole series

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
is really fun

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
and the crash mode in

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
Burnout Takedown 3

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
that was fun, it's awesome

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
and when I heard they were making a whole game

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
based on that mode, I was really excited

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
and so I downloaded the demo, I played it

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
and it was the most uninteresting game

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
I think I've played in a very long time

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
I'm sorry to say

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
but the whole switch to 2D

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
was just really boring

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
and how can a game

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
about explosions and crashes

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
and everything be boring

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
but it's like, I don't know, suddenly I feel like it's

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
this really slow moving

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
puzzle based game

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
and for those that haven't

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
played Burnout or know what the crash mode

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
is, basically it's all about creating

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
these huge explosions

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
and you can press a button to blow

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
up your car, essentially

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
and as you fill up a meter, you can blow up your car

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
again and again, you're causing these big

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
chain reactions and pile ups, and I know that sounds

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
really exciting, but in a 2D

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
Xbox Live Arcade title, it was just

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
it was really boring

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
I was so not interested in the game

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
after just, and I tried

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
I played through the whole first little demo and everything

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
I just, I don't want to drop

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
$15 on this, sorry, so

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
sorry Burnout, just not a fan

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
of the crash arcade, sorry

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
I would love to play a game

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
that was like actual racing

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
crash mode though, because that was a lot of fun

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
in Burnout 3, and I can see where maybe

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
somebody thought on paper it was a good idea, but it's

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
not, sorry

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
I also played

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
NBA Jam on Fire edition

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
which, you know what

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
I miss about the original NBA

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
Jam, the fact that it only had three buttons

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
and I don't know, like I tried to play

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
this new NBA Jam and I was just like

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
my characters were not doing anything I wanted them to

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
do, and you know, granted

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
you do not associate me

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
with sports games titles often

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
I'm not really an expert on them

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
but there are a few sports game titles I do

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
enjoy, and most of them have to do from when I was

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
younger and so forth, like

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
things like Blades of Steel and the original

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
NBA Jam, so when I heard there was a new one I wanted to play it

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
I damn near bought the one that was on the Wii

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
I'm so glad I didn't now, because I don't know, I just

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
didn't have a lot of fun, but I think

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
that would be a game that would be more interesting

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
when you're actually in the room with other people

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
because that was the other great thing about NBA Jam

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
that's the game we all played, you know, at

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
sleepovers and stuff growing up

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
when we were at the arcade, so

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
I think to sit there and play it by myself was

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
a little bit of a snore fest, especially when I was just

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
getting frustrated with my characters, and I was just like

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
eh, I'd like to go play something

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
else now, thanks

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
so, um

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
then the other game I played this week

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
so

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
I spent quite a bit of time

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
this week with

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
Final Fantasy XIV

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
I, after the phone call

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
last week, Mikolatov

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
pestered me and pestered me, and

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
finally I decided to buy the game on Amazon

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
because I found it for like 25 bucks

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
new, because you know it's pretty easy to find right now

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
and I got

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
the game, it took me

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
a while to install, that was the first

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
thing that pissed me off about it, because my

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
DVD was borked or something where my drive

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
wouldn't even read it, I had to dump all the

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
files to Alan's computer, because his drive

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
could read it, transfer it to my USB

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
drive, then install it off the USB drive

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
then it had to patch

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
so four hours later, I'm finally in this game

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
and I'm playing it, and

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
I will say this, you know, obviously we've

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
razzed the game quite a bit on the show before

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
because it was a dreadful launch, and nothing

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
is ever gonna change that, it's always gonna

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
be looked at as one of the most

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
horrific, horrible launches in gaming

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
the question I think that's on everybody's mind

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
now is, is the game any better now?

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
and I would say the answer is, yes

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
actually, the game is a lot better now

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
it's, the combat

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
mode makes a lot more sense

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
the game itself

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
graphically is really good looking

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
just

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
really gorgeous looking

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
sceneries, and some of the cutscenes

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
are really good, especially in the beginning

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
here's where the game suffers most now

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
at this point, is that I think

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
the game's biggest problem is that

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
like 11, it is really

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
not friendly to new players

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
and I think they've tried to

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
improve the tutorial a little bit

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
because I sense that there's been some things added

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
with that, but there's still a lot of

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
what the hell do I do now

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
going on in that game? it doesn't

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
really quite handhold you the way

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
that WoW does for the first few levels

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
and I had to take a lot on myself

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
to go research wikis

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
and fan sites devoted to the game to figure

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
out like, how do I get better

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
armor?

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
or where is the damn

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
auction house? you know, like these are things

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
that the game doesn't really help you with

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
and I realize that a lot of people

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
that are gonna defend Final Fantasy 11

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
and Final Fantasy 14 are gonna say, well that's

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
part of the game, these games are not WoW

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
you're supposed to figure these things out, that's the challenge

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
and I'm here to tell you, most people aren't

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
gonna fucking have the patience for that

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
that's fine

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
if, you know, the select elite

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
smart few wanna, you know, go ahead and

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
be all into it or whatever

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
but without a significant

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
amount of people supporting the MMO, the MMO

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
is not really gonna last

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
I definitely notice

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
there's a lot less people playing this game than there was

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
Final Fantasy 11 when I was playing it, I noticed that

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
right off the bat too, the server seems

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
a lot more empty than 11

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
but to the game's credit, again

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
it's gorgeous, the battle system's

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
interesting, I like what the

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
I really like how they've handled

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
the mixture of jobs now

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
like if you level one class

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
like a conjurer and then you level another class

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
like a Thermaturge, you can take

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
the spells you've learned as a Thermaturge and apply

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
it to when you're a conjurer, so it's like

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
you're building, everything is like your own

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
custom class that you've built of spells

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
and abilities mixed together from the other classes

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
that's cool, I mean, so

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
there are things I do like

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
about the game and where it's going

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
that reminds me a little bit of

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
7, remember with 7 you, you know

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
you'd get the different spells

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
from the

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
what was it, Espers? Is that what they

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
called them? I don't remember

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
Espers or whatever and you would

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
apply those in there and then

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
you can transfer those out and learn something else

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
it's kind of like that and you can

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
basically at the end, everybody had everything

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
the guild levs

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
or the little questing thing that they put

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
into it, you really can

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
do a lot with a very limited

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
amount of time, like I have noticed

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
you can get in there, do some levs and you know

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
you've gained some experience and you feel like you've done

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
something for the day and that's kind of

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
nice, like that's something 11 never really had

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
is that you had to sit around

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
find a party

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
okay, maybe we'll gain some experience

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
hopefully somebody does that, I mean

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
even as a white mage

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
sometimes you'd struggle a little bit

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
but the nice thing is there are things you

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
can do by yourself and the things that

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
they've done, especially with the crafting

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
the whole fact that crafting is its own

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
job system with its own quest even

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
I thought I was

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
going to really hate that at first, but I realized

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
it gives you so much to do

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
playing alone

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
that 11 never really had, at least back in

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
its heyday, keep in mind my frame of reference for Final Fantasy

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
11 is up until about

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
Treasures of Aurgon, I never played after

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
the Wings of the Goddess, well I played a little bit

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
of that expansion but never the

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
Abyssia or any of this stuff, like level sinking

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
I was already gone by the time that came out, so

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
keep in mind my frame of reference is a few years dated

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
in the game

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
now here's the other thing, and I know you guys

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
are probably waiting for me to mention this because there's been a lot

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
of talk about this this week, Final Fantasy

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
14 had a lot of major announcements to it

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
this week, one of them being, of course

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
the day the game shows up in the mail

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
for me, what's the big announcement?

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
We're going to start charging monthly for this game

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
hahaha

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
alright

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
and then they were previewing a lot of what they plan

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
to do in 2.0, and granted, a lot

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
of it sounds really cool, it looks sexy

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
as far as, the screenshots look great

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
they're incorporating the old school

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
Final Fantasy more into it, which I

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
think is great, I really like what they've

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
got planned out for Final Fantasy 14

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
2.0, it's going to be very

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
interesting and almost something unprecedented in

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
gaming, where can this game be

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
rescued? And it's going to be

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
really interesting to see if they're successful or not

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
but the fact that they're

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
going to start charging people when the game

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
is admittedly halfway done

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
is a little weird to me, and I'm going to be honest

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
right now

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
at this moment, in my point of mind, if they were to

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
start charging for this game tomorrow, probably not going to

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
pay for it, I'll enjoy my 30 day trial

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
period, and then be done with it. I got a lot going

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
on in Warcraft and other MMOs that I play

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
But, and it's not even

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
going to be done until what, 2013?

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
The end of 2012 I think is when the

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
big, big expansion is supposed to hit. Okay, 2013

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
But, well, here's the other thing too

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
you have to remember Final Fantasy 11

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
it didn't come out in America at first, it was only out in

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
Japan, and when it came out in America

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
we essentially got Final Fantasy 11

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
2.0, because we had Rise of the Ziller

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
included with our release

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
when it came out, so it gave them time to work out the

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
kinks, but now that that didn't

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
happen this time, and everything was kind of released

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
at once, it does make me feel like I'm still playing

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
this big alpha or beta test of a game that's not

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
done, and now they want to charge me for it?

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
Like, I realize they're trying to

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
recoup on some massive losses

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
on this game, but

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
Not my problem. I kind of

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
think they're in for a rude awakening

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
Like,

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
the amount

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
of failure of this game

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
is just

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
whew

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
It is epic fail

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
in every sense of the term

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
Now, I think it's going to be really neat if the game

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
can salvage itself, and I gotta

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
be honest, a lot of what I'm seeing online

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
and a lot of this plan, and I

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
like that now they're being

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
open with their customer base

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
Now they're talking more, now they're laying out a plan

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
Like, I think they realize they've fucked up in a

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
big, big way

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
I mean, for the president of Square Enix to say

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
this game tarnished the Final Fantasy

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
brand, one of the biggest

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
and longest running franchises in gaming

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
history, that is like

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
not something to just blink at

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
That's huge

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
Especially a Japanese company to say that

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
So

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
But I think if the game

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
kind of keeps moving on this path

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
I mean, it's definitely gone in the right

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
direction

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
Real quick, sorry, I listened

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
I went back and listened to how I first

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
described my Final Fantasy XIV experience

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
and I called it fucking garbage

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
That was exactly how I reviewed this game when I played the beta

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
It is no longer fucking garbage

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
But it's not an amazing

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
game that I want to pay money to play

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
every month. It's

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
It's pretty good. It's alright

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
It's on its way. It's getting better

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
But, see, what's the point if, like

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
why would I start paying for

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
this game when they're like, oh, it's not

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
really going to be done until next November

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
or, you know, the end of

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
the next year? Okay, well fine

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
I'm not going to pay for it until the end of next year

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
That's when I'll pick it up. It's like

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
why even announce that and then start charging?

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
All you're going to do is just get people to

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
quit. I mean, you may get a few people

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
that are die hard that are just going to

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
I'm going to level up my characters while we're doing this and stuff

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
while you're working on it

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
But I think a lot of people that were just like

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
oh, well, it's free right now. I'm just not

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
going to pay for it. But now that they're going to start charging

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
I'll just wait

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
and play something else and then I'll come back to it

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
in a year or so

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
But at that time, who the hell

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
knows what Blizzard is going to have at that

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
time? I mean, fuck, how many more

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
MMOs are going to come about

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
by the time that they're ready to launch 2.0

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
It's not going to matter

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
And a really good one is going free to play

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
And we've got

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
Swartar on the horizon

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
at the end of December. We've got

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
Guild Wars 2 next year that has a lot of people

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
riled up. There will

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
be a WoW expansion. By that point

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
Blizzard will have announced their next

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
MMO

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
Yeah, you're right. It's getting a little crowded in the MMO space

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
I think what's going to end up happening is it's just going to go

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
free to play. It's got to. I mean,

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
that's the trend right now and a lot of these

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
suffering MMOs end up going that way

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
But then again, they're Square Enix and they're fucking

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
stubborn, so maybe just

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
let it rot and die

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
I would love to read

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
a behind the scenes book on Final

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
Fantasy XIV. Like, this is a

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
this is a game for

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
better or for worse, this is a game that will go down in history

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
Absolutely. Absolutely.

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
And we're watching it unfold right now

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
Alright, let's move on

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
to some quick housekeeping

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
before we get into the gaming news for the week

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
Quick, quick housekeeping. Please add us on Facebook

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
be our friend. Facebook.com slash

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
Orange Lounge Radio. We're also on Twitter at

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R and

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
got to say this, don't forget to

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
vote for us in the podcast award. We are a

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
finalist for best gaming podcast

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
at www.podcastawards.com

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
We won this award

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
the very, very first year

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
which was 2005 and

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
Dark Sakura now has her duffy hat

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
sitting on the trophy. Yes, I do.

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
I'll take a picture.

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
Yeah, we've got that and

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
we would be honored to win it again

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
but there are a lot of great shows

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
in the finals but the promotion

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
that we could get for winning would be

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
great and as you know

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
we don't have a lot of big dollars

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
or ways to advertise our program

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
We don't have any big dollars. Yeah, actually

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
we have no money whatsoever so we really

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
rely on word of mouth as we say at the end of every show

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
so please, please, please take

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
a moment to go vote for us in the podcast

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
awards and don't forget you can

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
vote every day between now and the

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
24th? 27th.

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
27th, thank you. And the winners

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
will be announced what, early November probably.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
I don't think there's actually an award

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
ceremony this time though. I remember the first year

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
Dark Sakura went to an award ceremony where she sat

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
behind him. I was so sick too.

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
But um,

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
yeah, we would be honored to win again

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
and it would be pretty cool. I think we would be the only show

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
to have won the award like what, six years apart?

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
But, you know,

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
it's been an honor just to be

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
nominated. Alright.

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
That being said, we fucking

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
want to win. And also on

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
Facebook you can check out

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
we've got a little banner

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
art thing that you can put in your signature

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
on whatever forms

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
you happen to visit and stuff to help

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
promote, you know, voting.

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
Don't, don't spam people, but

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
at the same time, like, please, people you know

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
like, tell them, like, we, we really

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
do need every vote because

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
every show, and you probably,

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
you probably have a couple of the podcasts that are finalists

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
in your listening rotation, as you should.

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
There's a lot of great shows that were nominated.

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
Um, and there, you're probably gonna be hearing

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
this to death throughout the next couple weeks.

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
But, you know, it's, it's really

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
um, promotion from winning

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
it can't be beat. So,

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
it'd be great. Alright, uh,

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
let's move on and talk about the

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
gaming news. So,

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
Loki, why don't you start us off.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
Um, of course you know there's a new fall

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
dashboard update coming to the Xbox 360

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
to kind of make it look a little bit like, uh,

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
Windows 8 or, um, you know,

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
the Windows phone and that kind of stuff. Personally

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
I think it looks stupid, but, you know, whatever, that's

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
I don't really have a say in it. I got an

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
update, you know, on the 25th of November

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
when this actually goes live.

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
Apparently it's gonna be using a modified

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
version of Silverlight

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
if you care to know how it works.

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
Honestly, I don't really

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
care myself, but it's supposed

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
to, you know, do a lot of integration. Obviously

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
they're gonna have, you know, more Kinect support

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
and, um, you know, the live TV

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
stuff. Also, you're gonna be able to

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
do the, um,

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
you know, the, uh,

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
Bing searches and all

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
sorts of stuff to find different content on there.

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
And, um, I believe there is also

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
a, uh,

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
if you wanted to, I decided to

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
opt out of it this year. Um,

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
a beta participation to,

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
you know, test the dashboard early.

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
Uh, honestly wasn't a big fan of

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
having to update twice a day every single

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
day until the launch of the actual dashboard, so

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
I passed on that.

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
But, uh, that was available shortly

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
and I believe, uh, the

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
submission, uh, for the beta program

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
has been closed already. And,

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
um, yeah.

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
And of course, you know, for those keeping

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
track, 25th also is Black Friday.

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
So.

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
Busy, busy, busy.

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
Oh my gosh, that's rolling out on Black Friday?

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
Yup. That's a recipe

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
for disaster.

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
Maybe. That sucks for those employees.

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
Cause you know Microsoft's gotta be fully

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
staffed for a day that something like that goes live.

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
They'll have to work on Black Friday.

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
Well, they will at least have

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
their stomach full of turkey.

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
And, uh, they will be, uh,

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
be ready to take those. Loki always looking

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
at the bright side. You know what,

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
you know what an awesome thing to do is on Black Friday?

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
Go to a theme park.

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
Cause they're empty. I don't know about Disneyland.

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
Disneyland's always kind of the exception of the rule, but I will say, like,

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
I went to Magic Mountain a couple years ago, it was empty

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
on Black Friday. Black Friday and Super Bowl Sunday.

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
Best days to do that stuff.

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
Anyway.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
Uh, as far as the fall dashboard goes, are you

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
excited for this? No. That's about to roll. No?

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
No, I hate the way it looks. You don't like

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
it? I, I dislike it.

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
Windows 8, you know what, when that comes

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
out, I am fucking turning this shit off.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
So it looks like back, you know, back to

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
Windows 7, 95

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
XP, whatever you want to call it.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
You know, I don't like this crappy,

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
oh look at all these panes of information.

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
Yeah, you know what panes of information are?

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
It's more advertising space.

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
That's all this fucking is. And I

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
don't care about the ads that are on there already.

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
So why would I want to see more of them?

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
There are things I like and things I

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
don't like. Um, but as far as the

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
dashboard goes, I, I, I

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
have not been a fan of NXC

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
or whatever this current one we're on is called.

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
I just, I hate the way it's laid out.

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
And I like the fact that this new one is

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
going to have all the searching built into it for

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
like, hopefully it works for like options

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
and things like that too. Like, change

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
my gamer pic. I hope I can

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
yell that at my Kinect and it'll understand me.

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
Um, because like honestly

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
part of the NXC and part of the frustrating

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
stuff in that is that you

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
sometimes like honestly can't find

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
the one simple thing you're trying to change in your settings

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
because they're like all over the place. So

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
hopefully this has that a little more

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
streamlined. But as far as like being like a

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
streamlined entertainment box,

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
well shit, that's where they're all going now anyway.

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
But I think the next, the next

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
generation of consoles, just

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
you wait how streamlined

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
those things are going to be with your other

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
entertainment stuff. You know, but see, I'm, I'm cool

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
with the fact that they're going to have content on there

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
and I would, I would like to

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
believe that it's going to be free, but I don't like the fact

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
that it's tied in with like my cable provider

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
because I mean granted

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
right now with Comcast I have the most basic

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
basic basic cable possible. I don't

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
think I even have on demand or anything like

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
that, but I don't want

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
to have to have Comcast cable

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
in order to access, I mean I would love to get rid of

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
cable period. Keep the

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
internet of course, but and just have

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
access to this stuff.

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
Maybe not necessarily the stuff that's on

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
Comcast because if I want to watch on demand

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
Comcast stuff, I'll just

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
go to Comcast

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
and watch on demand. I mean there's a ton of

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
different ways to do that. I don't need to actually

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
hook up my console to do the same thing you're going to do on my

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
TV. It just doesn't make any sense.

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
I've actually really given thought to just cutting

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
my cable loose because I just,

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
I barely watch any TV.

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
Ours is linked to our internet so

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
Well yeah, so is ours, but I mean

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
still if we could even save 20 bucks a month

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
shutting it off. That's the thing though is as we did that

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
we cut out phone and we also cut out

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
cable, well we were going to

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
cut out cable and just keep the internet, but they had a plan

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
that was $2 more for cable.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
It included, so I was like okay fine

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
we'll do cable too. It's a good thing

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
too because my plan was, oh I'm just going to get one of

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
those antennas and hook it up. Yeah I bought one of those

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
antennas last night, they fucking suck.

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
They do not tune in shit. And so

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
I got nothing and the only time I did get to

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
tune in the channel it was so messed up.

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
When you have cable internet you kind of have to

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
have at least basic cable, right?

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
I don't think any of the companies will sell you.

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
No, you can get just the internet.

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
Really? I always thought you had to have at least

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
It's more expensive, but

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
Like local channels plus CNN, bare minimum.

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
No, you don't have to, but

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
like I said there is a deal that they have right now

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
and you can get it for I think

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
they gave it to us for about $2

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
more a month and I was like

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
you know what I can do that and

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
since Comcast doesn't have any

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
contracts it's like well fuck at the end

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
of the year just cancel so

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
or at the end of one year it's time

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
we can just cancel so who cares.

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
Ron's 006 in our chatroom at

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
chat.orangestop.com says they know

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
people don't want cable much and so

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
they will bundle it to force people to buy cable

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
to get internet. Yeah, I think that's exactly

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
what's happening.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
I'm sure these companies know. Well all they're doing is

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
raising the prices of, you watch

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
they're going to start raising the prices of a lot of

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
internet. Alright, well let's

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
move on to some other gaming related stories and

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
speaking of rising prices

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
these next little few stories

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
have to do with the online pass. Yes, that's

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
right. What once was Project

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
$10 is now becoming the standard

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
and if you don't believe me look at what they're doing in some

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
big releases coming out.

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
Catwoman in Batman Arkham

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
City, obviously this is a huge release

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
that's out, what, this week? Is this week?

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
Tuesday. Tuesday.

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
It's actually on my friend's birthday. Big week.

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
Well Arkham City is coming out and

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
here's the deal, if you want to play as Catwoman

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
you need to have an online pass.

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
One of them will come with

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
the game of course and you buy it new

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
that's the whole deal is that you always do get it

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
included new but if you end up

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
buying the game used you will have to

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
purchase the VIP pass for

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
800 Microsoft points or

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
$9.99 on PlayStation Network so

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
you know 10 bucks or however you slice it there.

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
They are quick to say that

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
playing as Catwoman is not required

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
to complete the game but

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
come on we all want to see Catwoman in

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
that outfit. Not entirely true.

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
Well there's more, hold on, hold on.

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
There is something else going on there too

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
and that is a deal with

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
a company called

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
the Evil G

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
which is a major major major

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
gaming retailer in America.

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
Yes. We call the Evil G

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
and apparently there is an agreement

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
with Evil G where

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
supposedly, this is an internal memo

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
that all customers that will purchase

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
the game used there

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
will be given a free code that will be

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
on the receipt. So

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
in other words Project $10

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
won't apply if you buy the game

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
used at this one retailer

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
who has their hand

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
firmly on the balls of all gaming

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
publishers around the world. I bet you

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
you're going to see there's a lot more titles because they have

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
they have the strength and buying power

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
to say listen bitches you're going to

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
give us codes for all these games.

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
And that's how they're going to get around it.

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
Does that hurt?

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
Everybody else.

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
Or if you're like me

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
who gives a fuck

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
about Catwoman. But here's the gross part about it.

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
It's already on the god damn

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
disk. It's just locked away behind

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
a code because they're assholes

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
is what it is. So you know what?

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
Fuck them. Don't buy the game.

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
Either don't buy the game

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
or just don't fucking play as Catwoman.

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
Who gives a shit? Tigerclaw in the chat

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
room points out there are Riddler trophies

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
that you can only get with Catwoman. Exactly.

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
That was the part I was going to bring up.

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
Yeah. So if you want 100% complete.

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
You gotta play as Catwoman.

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
Now granted if you buy the game

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
new you're not losing any of this.

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
You're not going to lose it. It's that but

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
you know this is just

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
that trend and by the

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
way speaking of trend

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
Electronic Arts

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
mentioned this week that Battlefield 3

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
will also have an online pass.

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
Battlefield 3 kind of a big game coming

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
out pretty soon. Just a little

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
title you might have heard of it. Battlefield 3

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
right? And this was all confirmed on

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
Twitter.

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
A user tweeted a guy working

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
for EA. Do you need to buy a

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
new Battlefield 3 to pay on Xbox

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
Live? And the response was you can

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
purchase an online pass for a used

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
copy. So I mean as if it wasn't

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
confirmed that this shit is now the norm.

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
And it's the first game that they've done

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
that it's not a sports game either.

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
Oh. I did not pick up on

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
that so. And

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
obviously going to be a huge huge

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
title no matter how you slice it. Yeah. I'm not surprised

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
and I think that mainly is just to stop

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
piracy because it's going to be a big game

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
that's going to be pirated. It's also and to be fair

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
you know for what it's worth this is also going to be

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
a big title because you're going to have

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
tons of people who buy it new

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
and they will not this will all be

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
transparent to them it won't matter they get the code with

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
the game. So

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
it's only for those people that are waiting to save a few

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
bucks by buying a used copy that won't really

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
be saving any money. Well just wait a little longer and I'm sure

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
by then GameStop will have the code for

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
you for free you know.

43:33.000 --> 43:37.000
Because they've worked out some sort of deal.

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
All right. Shadownext

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
in chat says buy a game new and support

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
the industry if you do that the online passcodes

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
are not an issue. I'm sorry once again

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
yeah I understand buying new and stuff it

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
supports the industry and stuff and I hear

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
people saying well if you buy used

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
the developer doesn't get any money

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
listen you stupid idiots

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
okay. The developer gets paid

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
when they fucking press the goddamn disc

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
it can sit on a goddamn warehouse shelf

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
in EA, Activision, you name it

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
and the developer is still getting

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
fucking paid for that shit. So the

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
fact that they're complaining that

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
we didn't sell another

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
new copy now our servers

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
gonna go down because we have less people

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
paying for it. No listen there's

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
exactly the same amount of people playing on those goddamn

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
servers as new copies that were sold.

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
You can't magically create two copies

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
out of one without you know some sort

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
of piracy. So I'm just so

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
and I think we all agree that

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
piracy is a no no. Yeah piracy

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
is bad but that is really the only thing

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
I'm sorry used games do not eat

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
into that.

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
It's just it's so stupid.

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
I'm with you and I'm not.

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
Here's my whole thing and again it's

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
the movie industry and I think what's good enough for the movie

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
industry is good enough for gaming and the movie industry

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
hasn't like died because of used games.

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
And you know there's always gonna

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
be game rental services and things like this

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
and I think there's just there's enough people

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
that want these games new the day they

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
come out. Yeah but see there's a lot of stuff

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
you don't understand preordered Skyrim

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
you know there's a lot of things that you don't

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
know about the movie industry too. They don't like

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
used product. In fact red box used

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
to have to you know they used

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
to sell off their used movies when they were done

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
renting them and then you know those would get

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
in turn sold to stores or whatever to

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
be bought. And now through the

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
exclusive deals in order to get the product into

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
those machines even though a lot of them are really terrible

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
deals they have to destroy all that product

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
because they're afraid of the used sales

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
eating into their new sales. And the same thing actually

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
happened with the original runs of Hummers.

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
It's just like... No seriously

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
not the Hummers but the Humvees through the military

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
the first run of them you could

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
convert them into Hummers for sale.

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
Wow. But then they actually

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
when they decommissioned them they had to destroy them.

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
So that they wouldn't be sold.

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
Same thing goes with

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
Warner Brothers for example Warner Brothers

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
they just instilled a 60 day

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
rental window on all titles.

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
That's for everybody.

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
You know before they used to have it

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
where it was just Redbox

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
and stuff now it's everybody and I heard

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
something I think they may even do at some

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
point it's going to be six months once

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
the rumors is going to be

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
turned into six months once

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
all these contracts are up.

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
Yeah they hate

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
the used industry but they're the only ones

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
so far that are kind of going to the

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
extreme. But once

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
again though I'm sorry I don't

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
yeah I understand that people

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
buying used or whatever

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
are going to be

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
affecting the amount of new copies that a store

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
brings in because if you have like 60 used

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
copies you're not going to be bringing in a lot of

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
new copies and so yes that would eat at your

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
bottom line a little bit. But

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
the people that sell back those used copies

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
take that money to buy new fucking

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
games that you may be producing.

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
So the fact that you're just

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
stopping people from buying new games

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
there's only a finite

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
amount of money these gamers are going to have

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
and if you're taking away that avenue for them

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
to sell it back used and

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
trade in to get a new game that you might be

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
making so that you can get your fucking commission

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
check then people are going to

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
buy less games overall so

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
you're just hurting yourselves. That's really all it's

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
going to end up being. I guess

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
at the end of the day most of the

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
games I buy I buy new so it really

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
doesn't end up affecting me but she kind of

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
can't help but go

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
they're going to make a buck wherever they can.

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
But am myself directly

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
is this going to change my game buying habits?

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
Probably not. But I will

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
say that there's like I kind of

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
noticed that this year I really am cutting

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
back and maybe it's just the economy or what have you

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
I really am kind of cutting back on

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
the games I plan on buying new. Like

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
I go back a couple years and

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
there you know I probably would have bought a lot of games

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
over the holiday

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
season but this year I really can't

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
think of a lot that I'm going to buy. I'm not even sure

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
I'm going to buy Dance Central 2.

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
Like because I'm really questioning like am I really

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
going to play it that much? Probably not.

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
So I'm only buying those games

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
I know I'm going to play a lot.

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
And that would be Skyrim

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
this year. Final Fantasy 13 2

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
next year. You know kind of a lot

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
of the big RPGs.

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
So I don't know.

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
Saints Row the Third.

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
That will probably have enough. See that's one of those

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
games where I might want to check it out used.

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
That will have a pass I'm sure but here's the best

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
part about Saints Row the Third.

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
Welcome they've got system link. I don't need to go

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
on your fucking internets.

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
I'll just play it local.

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
I don't need your internets.

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
Alright let's move on we've got lots more stories to tackle

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
Dark Saga.

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
There's actually something on my oh there we go.

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
Something on my microphone.

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
How about Wii stuff? The new

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
Wii bundle. Wii!

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
It's going to have new Super Mario Brothers

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
but it's going to lose something very important

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
to a lot of people. GameCube support.

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
No more GameCube. Sorry.

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
We're pulling a Playstation.

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
So this is like our version

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
of what Europe got

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
at the Gamescom or whatever right?

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
Pretty much.

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
It is going to have though

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
actually the system itself

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
is black.

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
It has a black Wiimote Plus

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
and a nunchuck and

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
a Super Mario Galaxy soundtrack.

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
And it's going to be out on October

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
23rd for $150 bucks.

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
Isn't $150 bucks

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
what a Wii cost right now?

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
Yes it is.

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
Alright. And they say that

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
the Mario Kart bundle is going to

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
still be available along with the new one.

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
Is that true Loki?

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
You're like half shaking

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
half not. Yes it's true.

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
I think they're going to sell the old ones until they run out of stock.

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
I'm not doubting what Dark

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
Sakura is saying but I'm like okay really? Is that really

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
the long term plan? Is that really?

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
Dan and I back in the day

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
went through the entire

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
supply of

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
PlayStations, DualShock Systems

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
at KB Toys

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
by where I worked

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
so that we could find the one with the port in the back

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
because our old one was dying.

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
People are that anal

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
and will try to find the ones

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
that have got what they want in it.

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
People still want a Playstation 3 that will play PS2 games.

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
I've got one. I have one

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
that will play PS1.

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
Well they all play PS1. I know but mine will play PS1

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
PS2. It's

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
the whole thing.

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
Which one of the games I didn't mention I played this week

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
I actually put in old school PS1

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
games on my Playstation 3.

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
One of the random games I played this week was like

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
the 30 Activision game collection.

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
Oh my god. Like going back and

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
playing it now I'm like god this is some sloppy

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
ass packaging and like what are these like

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
LSD influenced title menu graphics?

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
Like I can't even. You know what

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
I've had the urge to go back and play? What?

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
Jumping Flash. Like

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
plug it in and go play it like in the front room.

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
Awesome. And give myself a seizure.

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
But yeah. So

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
people will

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
they want the old one look at the old one. They don't care

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
then. I mean it really doesn't matter to me

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
I've got a GameCube. But

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
it's nice you know having it all in one.

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
I hope at this point

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
everybody who is interested in this

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
kinda already got

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
a Wii. Like I can't imagine there's gonna be

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
lots of people that are like left out in the cold

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
so to speak.

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
But it's still weird

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
like the math behind it is what's weird

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
to me. If it's cheaper it'd make like

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
$129 or something or $125.

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
Even a $20

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
cut in the price tag would have

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
helped you know like make this

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
make sense. Or like

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
new Super Mario Brothers and maybe

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
like Super Mario All-Stars or

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
something like that. You know that limited run game or something.

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
Well there's a little bit more and actually this is

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
for Europe specifically.

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
In November there's gonna be a bundle

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
that's Mario and Sonic at the London 2012

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
Olympic Games and it's

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
blue. But it's the same

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
GameCube free

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
edition.

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
The horizontal. The vertically challenged

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
Wii. Yeah. Essentially.

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
The

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
Wii.

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
The not so Wii. I just I don't

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
understand

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
it's the PSP Go again.

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
It's like hey we got this new

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
system that's coming out and it's got less

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
feature. No it's not that bad. It's not that bad.

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
Again I think most people

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
that give a hoot about GameCube compatibility

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
already got one. Like

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
but still the math just doesn't

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
make sense. If you're a gamer

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
they're literally cutting it out for no

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
reason than maybe they plan to sell

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
the games on the Wii U.

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
Which I'm sure is the that's really

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
the long term thing we're looking at.

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
That's why they're cutting it now. Because they know on the Wii U

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
they want to sell the GameCube games. Just wait.

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
Just wait. Oh it's gonna happen.

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
But

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
it's still though. I mean if you're looking for

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
you could probably just get the Mario

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
Car thing. And hell I'm sure you could probably

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
if you really didn't want Mario

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
Car you could probably trade it in someplace and

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
get New Super Mario Brothers. I mean

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
I'm sure a lot of stores have it. It's

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
a popular game and I'm sure

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
a lot of people have traded it in. But

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
just

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
I don't understand.

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
You might need the GameCube controller for something else

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
later on. Here's a

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
crazy random question. Do you think these new

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
Wii's are being done to combat a lot of

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
the modding that people are doing to their Wii's?

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
I think so. Because I think a lot of that modding

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
stuff runs off of files

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
that were part of the GameCube.

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
Like the Dole files or

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
whatever. Now

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
I'm understanding why

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
they just are slowly taking that out. Like

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
if that's part of it. That

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
makes a lot more sense now why they've removed it.

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
It's akin to

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
PlayStation 3 deleting the other OS

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
support but without all the hubbub. Because

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
you know

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
this is a physical thing. Nintendo can't

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
come to my house and take the GameCube compatibility

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
out of my existing Wii.

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
Yeah. Or they couldn't but that wouldn't be

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
good for them. Yeah. Not a good idea.

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
That would require

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
releasing

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
like an online patch which

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
Wii is very limited in what they're able to do.

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
Yeah.

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
Alright. Anyhow. Let's move on

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
with some more news, Loki.

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
So they're gonna have some new

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
as you may remember the Halo

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
HD remake. The Halo

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
Combat Evolved Anniversary Edition.

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
They're gonna be doing some sort of

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
like. Oh I'm sorry.

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
I'm reading the wrong story. Stupid me.

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
I was like what the hell are you doing Loki?

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
Let's talk a little bit about

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
the PlayStation Network.

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
The OLR host compatibility has been

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
removed out of Loki in the most recent

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
upgrade apparently. Yes. Exactly.

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
So there's

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
not really

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
the PlayStation Network hasn't really been compromised

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
but some of the data or

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
whatever that was grabbed from

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
the PlayStation Network the last time

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
has been used to try to compromise

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
the PlayStation Network again I guess.

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
So basically a lot of user accounts

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
I wanna say it was like 75,000

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
or something like that

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
were locked out because

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
people have been trying to attempt

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
or attempting to sign in using

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
login and password information that were

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
obtained of one or

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
more compromised lists

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
from other companies sites or sources

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
so I guess they're like trying

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
to login using your

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
Hotmail, Google or whatever

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
sites happened to leak

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
out some information

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
and I'm wondering if maybe that has

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
something to do with also

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
the Xbox Live users

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
which we're still getting a lot more of those now

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
finally being reported.

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
Much like

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
Sky had a problem with

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
people breaking into his account

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
and spending money on FIFA shit

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
there's been a lot more people

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
talking about it and

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
Thank you Gaming Press for covering this a month

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
after it was news. Yes

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
Ars Technica actually started

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
reporting a lot of people

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
actually

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
telling them that say hey

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
my game account was hacked and

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
they bought

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
FIFA 11 and also

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
the Gold Pass or whatever

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
spent $100 on my account

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
and there's been a lot of

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
other things people are starting to see

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
FIFA 12 and

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
purchases are kind of related to that

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
and

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
of course sure enough

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
all of my Microsoft points that were stored on my

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
Xbox Live account had been spent on

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
in game items for FIFA 11

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
I don't own that game, hell I don't even like

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
soccer games and whoever spent

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
my Microsoft points had tried to purchase more

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
presumably when the purchase failed

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
they abandoned my account and went to steal from some

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
other unsuspecting gamer

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
and yeah I think that's kind of the case so

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
of course you know change passwords

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
hopefully that's enough

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
and of course Microsoft

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
when pressed for a statement

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
they were saying we do not have any evidence

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
of the Xbox Live

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
service that has been compromised

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
we take our security of our

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
service seriously and work on an ongoing

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
basis to improve it against

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
any evolving threats

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
however a limited number of members have contacted us

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
regarding unauthorized access to

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
their accounts by outside individuals

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
we are working with our impacted members

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
directly to resolve any unauthorized

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
charges to their

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
accounts as always we highly recommend

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
our members follow the Xbox Live

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
account security guidance provided

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
at Xbox.com slash security

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
What a lovely sanitized response

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
from the Xbox media relations

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
department what a lovely

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
sanitized response because some

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
could mean a million

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
I mean I get it Microsoft does not

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
want to panic on their hands like what Sony had to

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
go through but you know they're trying to

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
poo poo this and make it sound like it's not that many people

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
when I've known at least

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
at least 12 people that this has happened to

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
And you just read the comments and like

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
Do you know how many people I've known that have had their PlayStation accounts hacked?

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
Zero

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
And I mean hacked for like money

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
or false charges

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
And you know on this story there's

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
109 comments and a lot of them

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
are saying

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
yeah hey are any

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
let's see here

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
um

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
where we go here

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
my account was hacked yesterday I'm getting the standard

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
25 day lockout treatment I'm also

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
disputing the charges on my

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
credit card

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
see here on July

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
10th the same thing happened to me

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
um

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
let's see here

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
a couple of people I know

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
have had this happen

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
so there's a lot of people that are like saying

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
hey this has happened to me and stuff and that's why

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
you know they even kind of made a comment on the story

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
hey uh

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
you know there's been a lot of people that have been writing us saying

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
hey the same thing has happened to me

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
so yeah it's a little bit of a pattern there

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
a little bit gotta figure it out

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
cause

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
and why is it FIFA players?

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
And why is it 30 days that your account

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
remember guys I didn't play my Xbox for a month

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
and I made some purchases

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
on Playstation 3 instead during that time of things

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
I might have bought on the Xbox 360 instead

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
you know so just

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
I think their whole process

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
needs to be fixed that's another big problem

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
Microsoft does some very shady

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
online things that they do you know not just

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
there's the whole credit card removal thing too

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
anyhow

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
as a pain in the ass I refuse to give them my new

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
card I will not give them my new card

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
info cause my last one just expired they will

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
not get my new one they'll still try to charge it though

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
and then when

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
they will still try to charge it good luck

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
they will

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
they will lock out your account until you

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
give them a new card so you need to cancel

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
I will close my Xbox account if it

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
comes to that I'm going on record

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
saying that they are not

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
getting my new credit card number if they

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
were able to

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
I will turn in my seven year

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
whatever it is Xbox Live membership

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
I'm done if that's the

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
case let it be known

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
there's a lot of stuff I see where people will

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
change their credit card and then

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
they'll cause they'll try to renew

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
and then it doesn't auto renew and so

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
they give them a new card to charge it and then

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
they'll charge another year on there and they get two

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
years instead of one

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
see that shit's shady like there's

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
there's a lot of shady shit going on right now

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
in all this Xbox

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
Live stuff and I think we need some answers

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
and stop with this

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
corporate speak

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
you should be able to get out of that stuff

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
this is why people are fucking mad at corporations right now

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
by the way not to go on a tangent that I

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
really don't want to go on on this program but

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
this shit is why people are mad

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
this is why people are mad

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
yeah because you can't take out your credit card you have to call

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
their customer service to remove your credit

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
card information off your account I don't

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
think that should be I think you should be able to do it

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
right away just delete it right out

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
oh boo hoo you can't get the

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
can't auto renew because it's so fucking hard to

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
remove your you know account information

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
alright moving on to a story that you didn't

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
hear anything about just 10 minutes ago on this program

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
some changes are coming to Halo

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
Anniversary talking

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
about the Kinect functionality some of the details

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
came out this week at New York Comic Con

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
there's going to be the feature to

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
analyze enemies

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
meaning that you can like actually talk to your

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
Kinect and go into the library

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
or something like that and look at I don't know

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
your enemies I guess

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
lore or something I don't know

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
what do you need to know about Halo enemies

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
shoot to kill, shoot to kill

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
enhance, enhance

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
and now you're going to be able to shout grenade

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
and your character will

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
throw a grenade

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
amazing and reload weapon

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
we'll also do that too oh that's so much quicker than

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
pushing a button how many times can you shout

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
grenade versus how many times can I

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
push the button this is just all

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
showy shit that you'll

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
never use well it's just like the past showing

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
your friend like look at this grenade

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
oh and this is only

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
possible through Kinect

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
they even said oh you can't do this

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
with like a headset this is only possible

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
through Kinect who gives a fuck

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
and also you know

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
before this the

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
only other thing that they said that you could use your Kinect for

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
was switching between classic

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
and HD mode I want

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
to play classic I want to play HD

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
why would I need to do that on the fly

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
who cares

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
that's not a full price game

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
so

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
alright that's

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
again Halo anniversary edition

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
like in another year probably would have bought

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
the game new but this year just not

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
not enough into it

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
to really want to buy it sorry

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
maybe I'll rent it

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
there won't be an online pass

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
because it's Microsoft huh

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
and if they try to do the online pass they're

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
going to get really they're

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
in a tricky spot

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
they're already charging for an online pass

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
and have been for years

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
alright anyhow Dark Soccer what do you got

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
for us how about something

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
that makes me particularly giddy

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
a release date for Street Fighter

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
cross Tekken

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
it's going to be

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
as far as other

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000

it will be out in March

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
this game's coming out sooner than I thought it would

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
like I don't know like I just kind of assumed

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
this was going to be like holiday next year

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
I don't know just kind of

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000

since he was in the cut scene

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
I mean come on there's like

a million Street Fighter characters I can think of before

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
Rufus but I guess he has his fans

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
whatever

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
that sounds terrible on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
Wii and DS

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
Jane's Advanced Strike Fighter

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
that's on Xbox 360

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
PC and PS3

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
Holy crap

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
why is there so many damn rugby games

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
coming out and this one also again

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
exclusive to GameStop for some reason

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
Jonah Lomo

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
or Lomu Rugby Challenge

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
I mean seriously, is that like the third

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
or fourth rugby game that's coming out on

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
Xbox 360? Wasn't one of them like exclusive

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
to Evil G2? Yeah, the last

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
one from 505 was

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
they were exclusive to

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
Don't get your own, rugby's cool, but

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
It's cool, but that's a lot of games

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
I bet there's more games than there are football games

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
or basketball games

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
Let's see, Pokémon Rumble Blast

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
on the 3DS

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
The Haunted, The Hell's Reach

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
Wait, what do you do in Pokémon Rumble Blast?

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
Is that just

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
I think it's like the Pokémon

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
Wasn't there a Pokémon Rumble or Arena

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
game or something like that in the Nintendo 64

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
GameCube? I think it's just like a fighting

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
game, sort of

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
with Pokémon characters

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
I don't know, I don't play Pokémon

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
What?

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
It doesn't matter

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
Just curious

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
It's the only 3DS Pokémon game that's coming out

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
There can be a lot of Pokémon

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
It's like saying, you know, Mario Tennis

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
is the only Mario game available this holiday

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
And that's it

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
That's everything

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
Let me travel to Japan and talk about some of the stuff

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
that's coming out in Japan this week

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
Starting off on the Xbox 360

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000

Excuse me, all out on Xbox 360

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
Moving on to the Playstation 3

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
I imagine you'll see a lot of that same stuff

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
Just on the Playstation 3

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
Yep, Dead Island, Deus Ex, FIFA 12

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
NBA 2K12

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
There are a couple others though

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
Hybrid Pack

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
That is coming out this week

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
What is this? Is this like a

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
Oh, it's the movie and the game

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
That's why it's a Hybrid Pack

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
Yeah, it's the movie and PlayStation Network game

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
Yeah, it's like a Blu-Ray

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
So it comes with the Blu-Ray and it comes with the game

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
It goes with it, so it's like an all-in-one pack

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
That is out on the Playstation 3

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
this week

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
Going to some other systems

Cause you know it's just not a week without a Naruto game

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
coming out in some form or another

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
Also a brand new type of memory stick

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
I guess a 4GB one

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
Is this with branding on it?

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
Yeah, this has some branding for Uminico no Nakakoro

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
Lastly

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
Trying to go to the 3DS real quick

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000

That's it

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
Busy week over there

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
Just a few more stories for you guys

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
and then the classic game of the week

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
But first, Loki

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
Microsoft has bought Twisted Pixel

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
Of course they just recently put out

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
a few games for the Xbox 360

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
including Explosion Man

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
and The Gun Stringer

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
also Ms. Explosion Man

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
and

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
basically Microsoft is a very big company

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
Twisted Pixel, a relatively

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
small developer

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
We're very interested that they get to stay

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
who they are and they get to retain the

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
magic that they have as a

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
small indie and also we'd like to

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
leave the golden goose alone so to speak

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
So basically they're going to

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
be able to do kind of what they

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
want but still have some financial

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
backing to go with that, maybe some

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
better projects because they'll have a little bit more to

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
work with

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
So that's kind of cool because they're definitely a unique

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
developer

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
I mean it's not too surprising, I kind of

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
already thought they were in bed with Microsoft

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
because hasn't all their shit been exclusive anyway?

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
Um

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
I don't know about that

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
I think they had some stuff that was

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
on PC but

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
yeah, I think for the most

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
part it's been exclusive to

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
Microsoft, probably the Microsoft

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
Well PC still counts if it's for Windows

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
Yeah, that's true

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
So they can still develop for that

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
Um, I'm wondering

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
if they're about to be trusted with some big

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
Microsoft franchise to make a game for that

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
Or I don't know, maybe Microsoft

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
just wants a piece of it You just don't have a lot of big franchises

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
anymore though, I mean

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
the thing about it is just Halo

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
and Forza

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
and Fable I guess

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
but they're not touching Fable I know that

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
Um, who knows

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
there could be something new in the works They could make anything

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
better than Fable 3, that'd be great

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
A new cameo game

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
It could be something new for the new system too

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
you know, there's got to be

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
stuff under development for the new Xbox

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
and we've heard a lot of rumblings about that

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
you know, whatever it may be, so maybe

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
because these guys did

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
you know, Explosion Man and all that

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
they're tasked with making some

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
must have game on the new system

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
who knows, who knows, just throwing it out there

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
I mean there's always new franchises, they can come up with

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
something unique and brand new

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
so sequels

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
Alright, let's see

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
one more story for you guys

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
for this half of the show and that is about

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
Ubisoft delaying a game

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
called Rocksmith

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
You familiar with Rocksmith?

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
That's alright, a lot of people aren't

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
Rocksmith is the game that like, it has like the real

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
guitar with it, which I kind of thought

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
Rock Band 3 was supposed to kind of cover that

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
but I guess Rocksmith

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
is supposed to be more like you actually

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
see the frets on the screen, it's a lot

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
lot different kind of the way it's presented

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
Oh, I think this is the game my friend was working on

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
Oh really? Well, it's been delayed

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
and now it's going to be launched in 2012

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
in Europe, and I guess

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
this is because of some complaint

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
that was against

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
Ubisoft

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
Yeah, filed by a band named Rocksmith

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
Oh, how funny

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
So I guess now there's a whole ugly thing that's got to be

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
settled around that

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
Court documents say that the dispute could

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
go through February 2012

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
so until that's resolved

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
this game is delayed

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
Unless you happen to buy a PS3 version

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
which is region free

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
Oh, okay

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
I mean, if you're really in a hurry, but

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
Is the game not coming out here in America?

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
Yeah, it comes out next week

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
It's just, you know, we don't have a band named

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
Rocksmith over here, and they're over in Europe

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
There you go

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
Alright, well, let's stop talking about

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
these newfangled games

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
and let's go back to the classics

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
Every week on this show, Darkstalker

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
dives into the gaming vault and finds a game

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
that she thinks, hey, listen

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
you kids and your Rocksmith

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
you need to go back and study

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
this classic game from the archives

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
the way games used to be

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
Darkstalker, what's the classic

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
game of the week?

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
Castle of Illusion starring Mickey Mouse

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
because we talked about it last week and I started

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
thinking about it, so it's this

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
In Japan it was known as

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
Castle of Illusion I Love Mickey Mouse

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
Great Wonderland Castle Adventure

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
Really long name, huh?

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
And it came out in 1990, and it was on

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
the Mega Drive slash

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
Genesis, developed by Sega of Japan

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
and it was

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
one of the

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
parts of the games that were released

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
right before Sonic Hedgehog came out

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
And I love this game, so

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
shut up. It's a side-scrolling

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
game, and you play as Mickey Mouse

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
and he has to save Minnie from

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
this evil witch named Mizrebel

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
who wants to steal Minnie's youth

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
because Minnie apparently is

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
young and pretty

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
And who I believe was not actually

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
a Disney villain otherwise though, right?

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
I don't think so

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
This is interesting that they didn't use

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
a quote-unquote real villain, but anyway

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
You know what?

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
No villain is as awesome as Maleficent

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
the damn diva

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
So, moving forward

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
You play in the castle, and you have to

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
defeat different enemies and bosses by jumping

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
on them, which makes you jump higher

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
And you get apples and marbles to use as

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
projectiles, and you get health

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
boosts and extra lives or

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
bonus points, and then after you beat the

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
boss, you're given a gem. When you get all

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
of the gems, you build a rainbow bridge

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
that lets Mickey walk into the castle

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
so you can fight the witch in the tower

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
And her, uh

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
Now, I need to double check this

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
reference because it says that her younger version

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
looks like the evil queen

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
from Snow White

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
It does kinda look like

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
Yeah

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
Who knows? Maybe it is her

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
It also did come out on the Master System

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
but they redid it

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
And so the Game Gear version is actually exactly

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
like the Master System version because it's one

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
of the ones that ran in Game Gear

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
One of the Game Gear games that ran

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
in Master System compatibility mode

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
So, um

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
I mean, there's not really a whole lot to say about it

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
It's a cute game. It's got some good challenge

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
to it. It's fun

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
Um

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
I mean, Rob, you're looking

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
at it, right? Yeah, it's a fun little platformer

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
You know, I didn't own a Genesis when I was younger

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
But I do remember, I remember there was kind of

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
a stink because this came out around

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
maybe a year or two after the NES

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
had Mickey Mousecapade

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
Which was kind of their big game

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
And Capcom had the Disney license for Nintendo

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
though. They weren't really putting stuff out on

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
Genesis at the time. In fact, wasn't Capcom's

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
first Genesis game, the Street Fighter

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
Championship Edition? I think it was

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
I think so. I seem to remember that

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
from my gaming history

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
Well, the Street Fighter 2 came out before

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
Championship Edition

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
Well, no, but remember the Genesis one

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
The Genesis got the Championship Edition

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
It was like a big freaking deal

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
But then the Super Nintendo got Turbo Championship Edition

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
So it kind of went back and forth

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
But anyway, my point is that I do remember

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
this game. I never played it when I was younger

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
because I didn't own a Genesis

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
But I remember wanting to because I thought

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
Gosh, this game looks a lot better than Mickey Mousecapade

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
Which actually was a pretty sweet

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
NES game. Yeah. I don't know if you've done

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
that as a classic game of the week before, but if you haven't

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
it should be someday. Well, this one

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
actually, I don't know if I've ever told you about

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
the week I traded my SNES for my friend's

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
Genesis and

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
Master System Converter

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
This is one of the games I borrowed

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
Oh, nice. And I had

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
a field day with this game

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
I loved it so much. I mean, there's

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
so much more to do. I mean, not just

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
you had the, you know, the

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
jumping boosts and you had swinging

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
from vines. Just graphically

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
this game was really pretty to look

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
at. You have to remember again, guys, this was a long

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
time ago this game came out. But some of these

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
environments, like this level that we're watching

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
Mickey in here on the YouTube right now, in

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
this like spider web

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
where he's floating on leaves

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
Like for a game of this era, it looks

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
fantastic. It's like paintings

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
You know? And that was the first thing

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
that really got me is just like, oh it's

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
so pretty and look how rich the colors

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
are and blah blah blah blah blah

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
You're climbing up a tree

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
I think this is a very important Genesis game. It really is

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
Well, um

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
There was a sequel

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
Sorry, I was just going to say weird that it's never shown up on

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
any collection. I mean, I understand probably the Disney

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
licensing probably has a lot to do with that

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
Well, now they've licensed, though

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
Disney took the license for Castle Illusion

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
Oh, that's right. That was recent

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
I remember that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, okay

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
And we don't know what they're doing with it. Right, right

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
Right. Probably just sitting on it for a while

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
I hope there's like maybe like a

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
newer version of this coming out. That'd be awesome

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
Well, let me go a little bit

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
further then. Sure, sure. Okay, well

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
first of all, there was a sequel named Land of Illusion

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
that came out of the Master System into Game Gear

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
and then Castle Evolution was re-released

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
in 1998 in Japan as

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
the Sega Ages Mickey Mouse and Donald

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
Duck on Saturn

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
and that also included Quack Shot

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
which is a very

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
interesting game on its own, too

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
So, uh, there you go

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
It did have a re-release in Japan

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
Alright

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
Very cool

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
There it is, your classic game of the week

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
Castle of Illusion starring Mickey Mouse

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
for the Sega Genesis. Nice pick

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
Thank you. Alright, that's gonna do it

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
for part A of our big show tonight

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
but don't go anywhere. We're not done

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
We've still got half a show to go. We've got a lot of news

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000

twitter topics and hopefully, I'm hoping

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
some people will call us that went to

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
people that went cause I wanna hear about

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
did you see the art on twitter?

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
I don't know if you've seen this. Sorry. No. Some art was

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
released of the main character

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000

Canadian Army. Yes. So

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
I will, uh, you haven't seen that fan art?

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
I'm gonna look. I'm gonna go to

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000

YYR underscore or maybe the other way

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
around, underscore YYR. It's one of the two

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
and he has the artwork in one of his previous tweets.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
It's awesome. So anyhow, we'll talk

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000

Welcome back everybody to Orange

Lounge Radio. We are

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
live on this Sunday evening.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
October the 16th of 2011.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
I'm out of breath. That was such a fast

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
break. Where we're

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
of course taping another episode of our show. Episode

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
number 432 to

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
be exact. I was showing

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
Dark Soccer the picture of Fernando

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
during the break from Bungee Ferret Tossing which

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
I guess we're gonna get some calls during part B.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
Some people are already private messaging

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
me in chat wanting

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
to talk about the game. So we're gonna hear more about it

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
later. But. Awesome.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
Do you approve of Fernando?

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
I do. I do too. I'm gonna have to draw.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
My favorite is the ferret with the tongue

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
hanging out of his mouth like ahh dead ferret.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
I feel like drawing the ferret.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
The question is when's Ronma gonna

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
cosplay that?

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
It's just

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
a matter of time.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
Alright look. You're gonna have to bulk up

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
for it though cause Fernando looks pretty ripped.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
So I'm just saying. I don't think

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
it's gonna be that hard for Ronchon. He was a

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
marine.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
Alright. Let's move on to some

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
rapid fire news. Every night we like

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
to or every night that we do a show anyway we like to

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
go through some news quickly cause we don't have

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
a whole lot of time. It's not a six hour show.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
But we do want to bring to your attention

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
a few other things going on in the gaming world.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
We do need another marathon show. Speaking of marathons

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
I gotta mention this. I can't believe I didn't show all this

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
somewhere else. I need to mention this. Need to need to need to.

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
Extra Life happened this past weekend

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
and congratulations. They

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
broke a million dollars. That is outstanding.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
And I know we had some members of the

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
OL army that participated in Extra Life.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
So. The moment you announced that Shermie started

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
licking her bed in excitement. At least

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
she didn't shit the bed. That's good. So she approves.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
Like licking is like shitting is for the tester.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
Now she's licking her pond.

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
Well she was until you decided to look.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
So she approves of the fact that Extra Life

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
raised that money. That is flippin

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
fantastic. And I'm sorry we couldn't participate

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
ourselves but you know we are

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
thinking about charity in the back of our mind

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
and maybe what we can do later on.

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
Also speaking of charity

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
the date for the new Umlaut I think

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
was announced previously but

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
just to reiterate it's December 8th this

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
year and it's gonna be flippin

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
huge. Like I

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
can't say too much. I may or

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
may not know some things

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
but it is on Thursday December 8th and

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
it's gonna be awesome.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
Awesome.

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
So if you are like anywhere remotely near

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
the San Francisco Bay Area you need to make plans

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
to attend. If you are

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
nowhere near the San Francisco Bay Area

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
you still should keep the day open.

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
Just saying. Moving on.

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
Let's go through some

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
quick quick news. Loki.

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
This is quite appropriate and I'm actually kind of

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
psyched to play it cause this is more of a puzzle game

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
than it is a crashing game.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
But Burnout Crash is gonna be

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
coming to the IOS both on

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
iPad and

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
iPod or iPhone

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
or whatever. So you can

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
check that out. I think that's actually

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
a pretty good fit for it because

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
yeah like you said it's more of a puzzle game

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
and kind of disappointing.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
But still fun. Still fun.

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
So check that out.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
No word yet on when it's coming.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
This holiday season they say.

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
Anytime between now and the end of the year.

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
This is kind of cool.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
There's gonna be a free to replace

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
Shadowrun game coming.

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
And it's an online

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
MMO. I guess originally

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
you know I guess

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
the game was supposed to be inspired by Counter Strike

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
but now it kind of

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
I don't know it's more top down. It looks to me

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
like one of the old

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
Fallout games or something like that.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
They're calling it kind of

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
Baldur's Gate with

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
Jagged Alliance but

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
I think it's awesome because honestly

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
the last Shadowrun game that came out in 360

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
was terrible so this

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
this is more like it.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
And it's free to play so

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
cool. And it's being made by

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
Sixth World I guess.

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
I don't know if they're

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
no Sixth World was the last one

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
I'm sorry. Cliffhanger is the one that's

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
putting this together now.

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
Oh god. That's gonna be awesome.

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
No word yet on what's coming out but

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
Shadowrun definitely has its fans.

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
And you know there's been some hit and miss games

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
in the Shadowrun universe so this sounds neat.

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
It looks cool. I mean it could be a franchise

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
if done well. It would be

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
successful so. Neat.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
And then last but not least of course

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
PopCap. They're always

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
putting out gamer

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
crack if you will. They have a new

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
game coming out

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
called Popcorn Dragon.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
And in Popcorn Dragon you

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
shoot fireballs to make popcorn

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
that a dragon then attempts to eat.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
They're saying it's kind of like a popcorn

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
fruit ninja with a cute mythical beast.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
That sounds so PopCap.

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
Like when you describe it I'm like god

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
that just sounds like a PopCap game.

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
To be fair I don't think we've really

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
heard of anything that that studio has done for a while.

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
I mean their last big big game was Plants vs.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
Zombies. That was some time ago.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
Well they have to port it to every single platform.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
Bejeweled 3.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
Oh yeah shit I forgot about Bejeweled 3.

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
You're right you're right you're right.

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
And then it wasn't technically PopCap.

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
The spinoff studio.

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
I really wish they'd do more stuff because

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
unpleasant horse is fucking amazing.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
But

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
yeah they had a few things.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
This looks alright. It looks like it could be cool.

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
And I do like

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
Popcorn and dragons.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
So it'll be worth checking out.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
That's the quote they're gonna put on the box.

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
If you like popcorn.

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
I do love popcorn and dragons.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
It just made me think about having

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
a little pet dragon and watching a movie

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
and going dammit I want to pop

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
this popcorn.

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
Who doesn't love popcorn

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
and dragons? Terrorists that's who.

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
You know what I don't like popcorn.

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
Really? Because the corn kernels get stuck

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
up under my gums and it hurts.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
Without fail.

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
I guess that's a fair but you like dragons.

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
Yes.

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
Because dragons will smite my enemies for me.

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
So you're not completely evil.

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
I guess I can see that in Popcorn.

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
I do get annoyed with popcorn kernels too.

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
Would it be my weakness?

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
And people at work who can't cook popcorn

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
with dam.

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
And end up making the whole building smell like

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
burp popcorn.

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
I love burnt popcorn.

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
I purposefully burn my popcorn.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
Just say her.

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
You are the office asshole.

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
My desk was like

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
two rows from the break room.

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
So it would smell like this burnt shit all the time.

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
Whereas I was perfect.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
And I had

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
our crappy microwaves.

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
You were perfect?

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
As for popping popcorn at work.

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
I had our crappy microwaves timed

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
that I could always do the perfect

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
container of popcorn with only a couple

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
of kernels left at the bottom and nothing burnt.

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
The end.

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
I follow the directions

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
completely but I know when to pull

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
it out so that it has...

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
You know when to pull out?

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
Yes. I know when to pull the popcorn out

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
of the microwave.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
Oh you.

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
You adolescent

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
children. You know how to pull it out when the explosion

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
is just right.

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
Hey I don't want to singe anything

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
in there so.

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
I have to make sure. With that dragon of yours.

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
Cause you know.

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
Cause if you leave it in too long

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
it's just gonna be waffen smoke

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
all over the building so.

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
You just have to know when to take it out.

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
And then it stinks all day.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
Exactly.

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
This is the clip I want them to play

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
at the podcast awards.

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
But yeah.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
What started it was

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
I had bags of

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
non buttered popcorn that people gave me

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
and it was just nasty.

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
You have to burn it a little bit to give it a little bit of a

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
smokey taste to it.

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
Just enough.

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
It doesn't smell too bad.

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
Okay as gross as the story is

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
and as non-video gaming related as the story is

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
I have to tell it. I'm like kind of the opposite

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
of you Loki. Burnt popcorn

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
not really a fan. But what I'm a

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
total fan of and can't get enough of

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
are like the barely popped kernels.

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
Like the kernels that have popped a little bit

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
but are like

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
not all the way popped.

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
I will pull a microwave. I'll pull out

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
early.

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
Just to get a bag full of those

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
because those are the

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
delicious kernels in my opinion

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
are the ones that are like barely popped. Of course they're also the worst

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
for your teeth but whatever.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
So. Alright.

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
Moving on to non

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
dragon related things.

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
Only us can you know

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
take a pop cap game and turn it into

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
pulling out.

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
Alright moving on.

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
Do you hear these sounds in the background?

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
This is the sound

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
of BurgerTime on Xbox Live

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
Arcade.

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
That's right. BurgerTime Xbox Live Arcade

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
it has a release. It is November

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
2nd is when this is coming out.

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
And look it's kind of an old

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
OLR in joke. It hasn't come up a lot lately

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
but I really defend the old

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
arcade classic BurgerTime

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
is vastly underrated. It's a great

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
game. I actually

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
contrary to popular belief I don't really believe

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
it's like the best arcade game ever made.

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
But it's a fun one. And it's underrated.

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
And I have to admit this looks pretty cool

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
what they're doing with the whole like round

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
platforms and the graphical upgrades.

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
Hopefully it retains some of that charm of the original

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
and I'm really excited to try multiplayer.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
So I will get to do all that

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
on November 2nd because that's what

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
the release date is according to Monkeypaw Games.

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
Who's making it?

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
Infinity Blade of course very popular game

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
on the iOS platform. I have yet to play it.

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
I don't know why I've been dodging it.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
But very popular.

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
It is actually going to be coming to arcades.

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
That struck me as very interesting.

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
But Infinity Blade FX

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
is making its way to

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
I guess Dave and Busters

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
and other

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
types of facilities

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
like that. So it's kind of cool.

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
Apparently though they have other games that they've

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000
ported with us like Fruit Ninja.

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
Flight Control is the other one.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
Any game that has a big old

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
touch screen they say 46 inches

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
is going to have this.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
They're saying it's going to be in all

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
57 Dave and Busters locations

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
of which we have a brand new one here in Roseville

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
not too far away. So Dark

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
Sakura we might have to go to Dave and

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
Busters on assignment for the show.

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
Ok let's do it.

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
We'll make that sacrifice. By October

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
28th so we'll have to go just after that to

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
make sure that the game is there. And then I can finally

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
play Infinity Blade be it in arcade form.

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
One other story before

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
I turn it over to Dark Sakura and that has to do with

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
Leisure Suit Larry. Ok look before

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000
they ruined it like 5 years ago

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
with the versions that were on the regular Xbox

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
and Playstation 2. Leisure Suit Larry

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
was kind of an epic game like

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
back in the day. Not actually by Epic

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
it was by Sierra. But anyway it was a great

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
adventure game back in the day. Well Leisure Suit Larry

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
in the land of the lounge lizards

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
is being remade.

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
That is the original game in the series.

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
They're remaking it with an HD

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
upgrade for the series 25th

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
anniversary which is coming up at the

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
end of 2012. Surprisingly

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
enough it's not Telltale doing

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
it. Which I would have thought

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
point and click adventure game surely this is

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
Telltale is doing. No it's actually being done by somebody

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000
else. It's being done by Replay Games

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
and this is very important. Al

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
Lowe who did the original

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
series this has his blessing

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
and he's working with them on it.

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
It should be noted the games

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
that came out within the past 5 years

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
he had nothing to do with. And in fact

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
he was kind of a bitter

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
betty about them and I can't say I blame him.

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
In fact listen to this quote

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
to EGM that he said

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
quote I'm overjoyed to see Larry released

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
from his digital dungeon after all this

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
time and be placed in the hands

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
of someone who understands him and

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
wants to see him brought back to

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
the forefront by people who love him and

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
understand him. That's what we call

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
subtly throwing shade.

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
That's also a little redundant.

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
A little bit but. Well you may remember

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
that Leisure Suit Larry before was released

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
by Venvedi

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
Universal who put out wonderful

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
franchise killing games

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
like the Spyro series, the Crash

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
series and of course the Leisure Suit Larry

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
series.

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
Thank you and guess who bought Venvedi

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
Universal? Activision.

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
See where we're going

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
here? Well they must have not optioned to

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
continue this series and after the last couple games

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
I can't imagine why. So now Replay Games

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
picked it up. What's cool about this, Replay

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
has said that if they're successful they're

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
going to keep doing these HD updates

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
through all the original games.

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
So that's kind of rad.

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
They're also planning on some new games.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
So let's just hope it

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
doesn't suck.

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000
Moving on, DarkSakura.

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
Well, how

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
about some stuff about the Nintendo DS?

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
No, I don't want to hear it.

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
Okay. There has

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
been over 50 million

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
units sold in the US.

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
And this was

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
numbers presented by Nintendo.

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
That's 7 years

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
post launch, still selling, and

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
like I said, 50 million

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
units. I wonder if that includes 3 DS's

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
because technically it's kind of part of the DS

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
family. It says and its variants.

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
Okay, there you go.

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
Also, for Ultimate Marvel

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
vs. Capcom 3, there

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
is going to be a playable Galactus mode.

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
That's pretty cool.

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
You can just have him

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
smack people with his bitch slap and

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
his flick attack, I guess.

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
You know who else I saw on there, by the way?

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
Phoenix Wright. Yeah, I heard about that too.

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
Phoenix Wright's in it.

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
Pretty cool.

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
Is it bad that I thought he was in the original one?

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
I did not play the original one.

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
They put in Frank West.

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
That's awesome. Frank West is

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
awesome. I love that character.

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
I mean, that's kind of a why, except

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
I guess he's pretty cool, you know.

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
And then last but not least, Star Wars

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
The Old Republic has a European

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
release date. It will be out on the 20th of December.

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
Two days earlier than

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
it was announced. Yeah, I was going to say they bumped it up a little bit

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
because it was supposed to be a

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
variance. Just a teens.

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
In MMO speak, three days

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
is a big deal, so it's nice that

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
Europe got parity with that.

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
In fact, the 20th for

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
them starts earlier than it

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
will for us, so now we're getting shafted.

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
Oh, Rob.

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
Alright, it's just one day.

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
It's not a big deal.

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
Alright, so

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
let's get back into some more long

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
form news. Of course, coming up

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
later in the show, the mailbag at

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com is where you can always send us

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
emails. And the FUs of the week coming

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
up as well as Twitter topics. Make sure you

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
get those in because we will read Twitters

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
while we're waiting for calls

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
at Twitter.com slash

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
O-L-R. So get those all in right now.

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
Loki. Unfortunately,

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
you know, when you're a game

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
studio that produces

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
all the Harry Potter games

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
for the movies, and then the movie series ends,

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
what's

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
left for you than

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
to just, you know, go under?

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
I actually have an answer to that, but I'll let you

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
finish the story. Yes.

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
Apparently, the

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
Bright Light Studios is now

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
under a formal

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
under the formal

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
consultation process

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
and they basically

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
the employees that are impacted

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
will be considered for other positions

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
at other EA studios

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
including those in the UK.

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
The UK is a vital center for

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
of game development

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000
for EA and we intend to maintain

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
a strong presence there. And of course

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
you know

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
the last few games that they put out and kind of

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
ehhh. But you know

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
the movie tie-in games weren't really

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
they don't have a high bar to hit

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
but even then they missed those. So

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
maybe it's

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
for the best. I mean it sucks

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
that people are out of work, but come on man

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
maybe they'll reform

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
with some better hands

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
leading the brigade. You know sometimes

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
sometimes that's the silver lining that comes out of

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
these studio closures is that you know

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
they'll reform with different

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
direction and that could be a good thing.

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
The one thing I do want to say about this though

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
to answer the question, what could they be doing now?

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
A Harry Potter MMO?

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
Like. I would not want them

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
doing that. Well yeah and maybe this is

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
for the best. Like it sounds like based on

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
the games that they've made and I've played some of these games

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
they're not that great.

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
They should

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
put it in more capable hands if they're going to do a

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
Harry Potter MMO but seriously I'm not even

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
that into the Harry Potter universe. I still haven't

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
seen a single movie past the third movie

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
and I really haven't read the books.

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
I would

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
try this game in a heartbeat because

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
that universe would just be fun.

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
It's meant for a video game. Another game

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
that they created that

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
also was terrible. Create.

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
What the hell is that? It was supposed

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
to be a thing that was going to take on Little Big

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
Planet. Came out last year. No one gave

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
a shit about it. Was that the Xbox thing? It was

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
Xbox, Playstation 3 and Wii.

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
Terrible! What was

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
Microsoft's answer to that? Didn't they have something?

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
Oh that was also terrible. That ended up being an

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
indie games thing didn't it?

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
It was not Zubo.

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
Was it Zubo? I don't remember. I don't know. They also did a game

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
called Zubo on the DS but

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000
yeah I don't remember.

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
The other thing I want to say about

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
Harry Potter. Pottermore.

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
There could be game material in there.

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
I don't know. I just

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
I don't know. I would really like to

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
see an MMO come out of the Harry Potter universe

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000
but it does need to be done right. Don't

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000
do a shitty MMO or people are going to be upset.

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
So.

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
Alright. Anything else before I move on?

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
Yeah but it's a tangent so I'm not going to go there

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
right now. Alright why not? I'm going to start another story

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
so go ahead. Go for the tangent. I forgot to mention

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
since it wasn't really my gaming week

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
and one of the reasons why I didn't play a lot of games

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
this week because I was reading Ready Player

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
One. It's fucking amazing.

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
Oh yeah that was the book you were talking about last week.

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
I'm serious. Any of our listeners

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
for the show this book is for you. I mean

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
it's absolutely without a doubt

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
for you. Can I get it on Kindle?

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
Yes. Maybe I'll check it out.

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
Dude I mean

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
not the spoil stuff but like

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
be careful.

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
Okay I'm going to spoil one thing but it is kind of cool.

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
The very first challenge

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
that this guy has to go through to get this

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000
because you have to find three keys and unlock

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
the gates to find an easter egg

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
that basically gets you the

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000
assets of this company. This guy

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
is like a multi-billion dollar thing.

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000
So it's a little bit like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000
with the treasure hunt and stuff like that.

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000
He has to fight a lich.

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000
Is it the lich king?

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
He has to joust the lich

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000
and the uh

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000
it's like I forget the dungeon

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000
it's some dungeon from Dungeons and Dragons.

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
Is it the lich from Shadowgate?

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000
Not the lich from Shadowgate. But he has to fight him

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000
he has to joust him

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000
on the old arcade game

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
joust.

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
I knew something was coming with that.

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
Seriously it's a fucking amazing

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
book. You said this has been optioned for a movie right?

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
It has been optioned for a movie.

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
Warner Brother bought the rights last year.

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000
I'm serious. Go check this book out

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000
now. It's great.

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
Speaking of movies and all that stuff

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000
I have to get this out there.

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
You know how like I talked a lot last week about the

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
various shadow casting stuff that's going on in town

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
you know I did Repo last week

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
and there's Rocky Horror of course is the king

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
of shadow cast movies and I think there's people

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000
that shadow cast other movies too. Do you know what

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
shadow cast I believe

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000
I have heard rumblings of this and I think it was on a

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000
website somewhere and it was in the paper

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000
in an article on the group here that does

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000
a lot of shadow casts. Do you know what movie they're planning

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000
to shadow cast next year here in Sacramento?

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000
What? Scott Pilgrim vs. The World.

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
Awesome!

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000
And now you know the movie

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000
when I first saw it was only kind of eh

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000
but thinking about seeing

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000
that movie in a group of very

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000
like minded individuals who are going to be there

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000
for the sheer cheese factor of it I actually think

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000
it's going to be pretty fucking awesome.

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000
So. But I'm serious.

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
Go. I don't read books

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000
a lot. I mean hardly ever.

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000
And I couldn't put the book

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000
down. I had to read the whole thing straight through

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000
until I finished it. And it's just

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000
it's seriously

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000
if you're a fan of the 80's stuff, if you're a fan of

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000
classic video games, if you're a fan of

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000
just cool like kind of

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
where's the internet going to go? That type

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000
of thing. And you got to read

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000
this. It's just amazing. Anyways.

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000
So that's my tangent there.

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000
Moving on to some other news.

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000
Oh let me play this way. No you're done.

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000
No no this is cool. The

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000
writer of this. He did a movie of

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000
Fanboys. He wrote the script and everything

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000
for that. Oh god I've heard about. Okay.

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000
I haven't seen that movie but I know what it is.

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000
The guy. He drives around

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
in one of the cars

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000
the avatar in this game

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000
or this universe drives

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000
around. It's not like a blue avatar.

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000
No like he hits this

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
avatar in a virtual world type thing.

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
He drives around or flies

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000
around I should say. And DeLorean

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
that has

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000
something from Buckaroo Banzai where it allows

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000
them to travel through matter. Also

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000
has the Ecto-1

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000
logos and stuff on it. Also has a light

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000
bar from Knight Rider and Kittencider.

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000
And this guy fucking drives around in

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000
a goddamn DeLorean that has all that shit

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000
on it. Well obviously not the time traveling

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000
and the matter thing. But

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000
he drives around a fucking DeLorean

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000
with the kit and the light

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000
bar and everything.

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000
An actual car to all the book signings he goes to.

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000
It's amazing. ActDeft once again wants to know

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000
the name of the book. Ready Player One.

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000
Alright just for you Loki. I will

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000
try to get the author on the show. Why not?

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000
Sure it's

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
amazing. It's a great book. Why not?

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000
Alright. Moving on

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000
I want to talk quickly

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000
about this. A video game

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000
soundtrack. But not your typical video game

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
soundtrack. It's a video game soundtrack by

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000
the London Philharmonic Orchestra.

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000
So this is pretty cool.

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000
They're actually going to be putting out a

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000
CD called The Greatest

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000
Video Game Music. It will be

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000
21 tracks with music that

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000
encompasses like 30 years

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000
worth of games. Super Mario,

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000
Angry Birds, Metal Gear

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000
Solid Sons of Liberty, Fallout 3.

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000
Awesome. There's a

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000
sample available online. It's

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000
Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000
theme. And they actually have a clip of it

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000
available on SoundCloud

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000
that you can check out under username

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000
kwahl. Let me play a quick little

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000
clip here of

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000
this. If I can kind of skip ahead in the song here a little bit.

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
I can't change the volume on this but usually these

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000
classical songs are a little

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
quieter anyway.

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000
You kind of get the feeling, right?

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000
Here we go.

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
That's the London Philharmonic Orchestra doing that.

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000
So that's going to be awesome.

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
Available wherever

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000
you buy CDs. You know, Amazon, iTunes

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000
what have you. Alright. Let's go

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000
to the mailbag. Every week you guys send us

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000
emails at mailbag at orangeloungelaunge

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
radio.com

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000
Dark Soccer is going to read some of her favorites

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
right now. Mailbag at orangeloungelaunge radio.

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000
All two of them. Two?

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000
Yep. First one comes... I'm firing the

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000
listeners. First one

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000
comes from Ian. Hey guys, long

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000
time listener, first time, I don't know, emailer

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000
whatever. I'm not sure if

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000
you guys knew about this or not but

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000
over the DSiWare store

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000
you can

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000
I guess you can get, the word get was left

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000
out. Legend of Zelda Four Swords Anniversary

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000
Edition for free. Hells yes.

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000
I'm not sure when it runs out but you better

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000
act fast. Actually, I have an answer for that.

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000
I was aware of that.

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.000
It's pretty big news in the DS world if you're a

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000
3DS owner. And absolutely it's free.

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000
You literally have no

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
reason not to get it. I haven't done it yet.

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
Unless you don't have the 3DS.

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000
February is when it will not be

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000
free anymore. So it won't be free forever.

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000
I don't have a 3DS.

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000
The good news is those of you that get them at the holidays

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000
will, you know, which I imagine

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
a lot of people are going to find 3DS's

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000
you know, under their Hanukkah tree or whatever it is

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.000
they will

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000
you'll be able to still get it through February.

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000
Next email?

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000
Why not?

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
Hello peoples.

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000
And this comes from Retertainment.

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000
There's a story that broke

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000
this week that just seemed to stick out my mind.

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000
Why men are in trouble.

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000
Okay, I'm going to click this.

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000
Men are always in trouble.

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000
Because we won't man up.

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000
The reason that this story sticks in my mind

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000
is because we pull out the popcorn too soon.

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000
I don't know about you, but

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000
I tend to tune out people who nag me to do things.

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000
It seems that no matter who it is

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000
or what it is about, whether they

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000
or it is substantial or not

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000
if you nag me, I tend not to pay attention.

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000
I tend not to pay attention

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000
to what you are currently saying

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
or what you have said and will say in the future.

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000
So when William Bennett, President Obama

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000
or my mom tells me to get off the video games

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000
five hours a week, get yourself together

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.000
get a challenging job, or get married

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000
I tend to put that in the bottom of my to-do list.

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000
Stay black, Retertainment. This message was crafted

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000
while watching a news podcast on my Apple TV.

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
That's just called having a rebellious nature.

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000
You don't want to do

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.000
what someone tells you to do. Someone says

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000
do it, you want to do something else.

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000
That's actually very common. A lot of people

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000
kind of have that rebellious nature.

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000
Right? Well, I'm just

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000
kind of glancing this over and...

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.000
Is this an opinion piece?

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000
I noticed this on CNN. Yeah, I think it's an opinion piece.

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000
By a dude.

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000
It is. It's by a guy here.

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.000
Eh. Don't care.

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000
Thank you. Thanks for your email.

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000
I was trying to read over your shoulder.

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000
Oh, you can get in the email and read it yourself.

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000
I'll read it and be more educated.

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000
Do I look like your correspondent?

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000
Now who's nagging?

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000
I'm not nagging.

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000
It's written by a guy who's literally from the middle ages.

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000
Oh, you read it?

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000
Yeah, he's like, he's super duper...

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000
Thank God someone's educated on this program.

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000
He's so fucking old and he just like

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000
he complains about all this stuff.

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000
Back in my day!

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000
No, I actually put a comment on my Facebook

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.000
if you want to link the article. I'm like, yeah, this article

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000
is missing a lot of, back in my day

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000
and get off my lawn. I mean, because seriously

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000
that is what this is complaining about.

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000
They need a medal. Those people need

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000
to go to the military and fight for their

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000
country and blah, blah, blah. This is the

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000
problem with people. They sit at home and play

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000
their Xbox instead of getting a job.

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000
It's like, oh my

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000
God. I mean, seriously.

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000
Okay, well, how about this?

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000
Okay, I'm going to put it this way. This is a military angle.

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000
Now, would you go to work

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
for a place that you knew was in

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
debt and charging more debt?

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000
This

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000
is going to get political. I already know where you're going.

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000
But I'm just saying, would you?

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000
If they offered a great retirement plan, I might.

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000
Touché.

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000
Gotcha!

01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.000
However, if the company was in

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000
debt and started laying off people

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000
before you could retire.

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000
I think, logically,

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000
any profession you go into, you would think

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000
about the longevity of your job, absolutely.

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000
So then why would it be a good idea

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000
then to go into the military when

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.000
the entire, the last

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000
couple of wars have been waged on

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000
a visa?

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000
He's

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000
one of the people that's wrong with the problem.

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000
He's probably one of the 1% too.

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000
I don't want to say anything negative about people

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000
that choose to go into the military because

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
it's a thankless job that

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000
not everybody's brave enough to do.

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000
No, that wasn't my point. I'm saying in response to this guy.

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000
What makes it attractive

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000
if, now I understand

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.000
going in for patriotic, that's one thing.

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000
Or going in because, you know, it's a good option

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000
right now. It's kind of a good,

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000
to be fair, it's

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000
a really good substitute for

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000
school. I mean,

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000
I know that sounds like really fucked up, but like

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000
that real world experience, because people

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000
do a lot in the military. Well, I even

01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000
considered going into the reserves

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.000
for the Air Force.

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000
But the whole, the whole

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.000
thing is, is that he's bringing this up

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000
but what he's not looking at is that

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000
is there really going to be a future

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000
for more people involved if they can't afford

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000
to pay the people involved?

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000
If we're just charging up more debt.

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000
I think that this guy's one of the old schools

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000
who's part of the problem.

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000
You make it sound like though that we're paying back

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000
the debt.

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000
We can borrow as fucking much

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000
money as we want. That's the problem.

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000
That's the problem. They're not paying for

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000
the debt because we're not having a raise in taxes.

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000
We're not rationing,

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000
we're not doing any of the stuff that they've done in past wars.

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000
This world's going to hell in a

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000
handbasket. I bet you anything would have

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000
more jobs if there were, um,

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000
if we were actually working to fund this stuff ourselves,

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000
not outsourcing everything. Well,

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
that's a whole nother Oprah. I wasn't literally

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000
saying though that he was telling people to go into the

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000
military. I was just saying that he's, you know,

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000
of the mind of like

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000
old, old, old people. I know that mindset

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000
though. Just like very stubborn.

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
He thinks, oh, it's a new thing. Therefore,

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000
it's the cause of all problems. If it wasn't the comic books,

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000
the rock music, the

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000
drugs and more rock music,

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000
I mean, or maybe rap music.

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000
Um, yeah.

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000
Wasn't it, and I'm

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000
going to horribly misappropriate this

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000
quote and hopefully not disrespect

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000
somebody who recently deceased, but

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000
wasn't even Steve Jobs who said

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000
something about like drugs was

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000
one of something that really like

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000
the, like, like the one time he did it

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000
was kind of like a life changing thing.

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000
Not necessarily in like a negative way, but that

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000
it was something that

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000
I shouldn't have opened this box.

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000
I tell you what, we would be missing

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000
several classes. Not that I'm

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000
condoning drugs. I'm not condoning drugs.

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000
But I'm just saying, you know.

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000
Keep in mind, think of how many

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000
classic masterpieces would be missing if

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000
not for Ebsynth. Sometimes

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000
people who are a little rebellious

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
cause us to think a little

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000
bit differently. I guess that's really my point.

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
That's, that's exactly it.

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000
Think different, right? Touche.

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000
Except that's bad grammar, and I can't

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000
quote that. Shush. Alright.

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000
Moving on. Uh,

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000
that's it for the mailbag, huh? That's it. I said

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000
this too. I guess that, this would be a, well, I

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000
wasn't listening, because all I was hearing was

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000
nagging.

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000
Rob. Rob. Rob.

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000
What a good opportunity to go to the FUs

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000
of the week.

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000
What?

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000
And the whole market

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000
thing is really coming back

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000
to, it's really, and I told you

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000
guys before the show, but it's really

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000
playing a personal role in my life

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
and it's

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000
ridiculous. And, uh,

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000
I really want to

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000
give a big FU to people

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000
who try to argue

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000
against

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000
something that they don't believe in

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000
by using, um,

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000
fallacious arguments.

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000
Like, number one. But using

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000
fallacious is okay. That's fine.

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000
But you know what I mean.

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000
Like, trying to discredit the person

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.000
talking about something by saying that,

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.000
you know, by trying to insult

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.000
them, or by using

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000
you know, sensationalist

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000
words or trying to show that

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000
you know, an issue is

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.000
skyrocketing, or throwing

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000
someone off the path to try

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000
to make themselves seem like they know what the hell they're talking

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000
about when they really don't.

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000
You know, if you don't know

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000
if you feel a certain way just

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000
because you feel that way

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000
or, you know, you have

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.000
an opinion based on a feeling,

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000
just say that. But if you don't have facts to support

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000
it, don't inject your shit where

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000
you don't know what the fuck you're talking about.

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000
The end.

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.000
Loki!

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000
Fuck you to, uh,

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.000
being invited to

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000
the Saintsboro Hollywood

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000
pre-launch event the day before

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:13.000
it happens, and yeah, it's

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.000
just kind of hard to

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.000
justify paying $400 for a

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000
goddamn ticket or driving, you know, a total

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.000
of like 12 hours to and back

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.000
from LA to go play Saintsboro

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000
for three hours. I would have been in the car.

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.000
I don't know, Loki.

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000
Yeah, but see, I have a wife to contend with

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000
as well. Yeah, that's true, that's true. Um, but, you know,

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000
hey, if they were going to fly me down or something like that,

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.000
that's cool. But see, here's the thing, it's like

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.000
not that I would really want to rub elbows with

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.000
you know, Lindsay Lohan or anything like that

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.000
down there, but they had

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000
a bunch of people, you know,

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.000
all the photos are people, you know,

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:47.000
taking in the free alcohol and

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.000
taking pictures and dancing and stuff like that, but no one

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000
fucking playing the goddamn game was like

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000
God damn it, they're playing the game!

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000
I was like

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000
all you people don't give a shit. Lindsay Lohan

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000
doesn't even fucking know what Saintsboro is.

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000
She was really there.

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000
Was that the one where they got the picture? Yes, it was the one

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:05.000
right there. That is the one.

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.000
That is the event that she was at.

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.000
I don't know what the fuck Saintsboro is.

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.000
They're paying her to be there. She's just like, somebody gives a shit

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.000
about me? I'm so there.

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.000
They had, what was it, they had one of the

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.000
Kardashians or something there, but not

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.000
any of the famous ones or something.

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:21.000
I don't remember who it was, like Rob Kardashian

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:23.000
or something. Isn't he the one

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.000
that's on Dancing with the Stars? Yeah. Who was?

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.000
I don't know who the fuck he is. But, uh,

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000
you know, it's just like all these people, like, I wouldn't

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:31.000
know who the hell they are. And then they're like,

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:33.000
so, but, my guy at KHQ

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.000
is awesome though, for at least sending me the invite,

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000
you know, I was like, he's like, I just found out about this

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:39.000
yesterday, and I'm like,

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:41.000
yep, pretty much can't go there, so,

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:43.000
well, but I keep

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.000
tabs with them to see if there's something in San Francisco.

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.000
I gotta say, I'm fortunate in that,

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.000
you know, if something were to come up,

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.000
like, let's say, BlizzCon's coming up

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.000
this weekend, and like, if I could somehow swing it

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.000
with my work, or even if I couldn't, like,

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:57.000
if the event was on a Saturday, I'd be in the

01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:59.000
car Friday night. No, I

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.000
would've- Allen would be like, can you take me with you?

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000
I, I seriously, well, the only

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.000
reason I know is $400, because I looked at prices

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.000
and tickets, and it just, it was not gonna happen

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.000
even, even if I was able

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000
to pay for that, the flights just went-

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:13.000
You got a family to think about now. And the flights just didn't

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:15.000
jive, and you would've had to, I would've

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:17.000
had to drive 12 hours for the playoff, 3 hours

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:19.000
worth of a game is coming out in a few weeks, I mean,

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:21.000
I would normally

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:23.000
do that, if, you know, I had no restrictions,

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:25.000
but, I, you know,

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:27.000
I'm not, I don't make

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000
enough for $400, I can just

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000
blow away.

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.000
Alright, fair enough. Um, my FU of the week,

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.000
I, I don't have a lot of serious stuff.

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:37.000
Things are going relatively well, all things considered.

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.000
So, FU to, um,

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.000
I would say FU to the traffic up in Apple

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000
Hill yesterday. Like,

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.000
in the fact that all of the roads up there are only one lane

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.000
with stop signs. I mean, I get that it's supposed to be

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.000
all rural and country, but, there comes a

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:51.000
point where you just admit you need to build

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:53.000
a better off-ramp.

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.000
That's it.

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:57.000
Uh, moving on to a couple more

01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:59.000
news stories for you guys, and then, of course, Twitter

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.000
topics in the Skype line very, very soon.

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.000
Loki. Uh, this is kind of exciting.

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.000
Not in the way you probably think, though.

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:07.000
Um, Grand Theft Auto 3 is

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:09.000
having its 10th anniversary.

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:11.000
So, Rockstar is celebrating

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:13.000
by porting it to the iOS

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:15.000
platform. Uh, this would actually

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.000
be the new iOS stuff.

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000
The iPad 2 and iPhone 4S

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:21.000
are gonna be the only devices that are

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:23.000
supporting it, at least on the Apple end. Android

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:25.000
phones are also getting it, uh, Droid X2

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.000
HTC Evo 2.

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:29.000
LG Optimus 2X, uh,

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.000
Motorola Atrix, and Samsung

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.000
Galaxy S2, as well as

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.000
Android tablets, Acer, uh, Icona,

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.000
um, the Asus E Pad,

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.000
Motorola XOOM, and Samsung Galaxy

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.000
Tab 10.1.

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:43.000
Um, so, that game's

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.000
gonna be ported there in HD graphics

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:47.000
and stuff like that, of course, you know, some

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000
unique gameplay stuff there, but,

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.000
I don't know, I think it'd be pretty hard to play

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:53.000
on a, uh, system. I'm just excited

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:55.000
about the fact that they're doing that, cause that means

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:57.000
that, you know,

01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:59.000
sooner or later this is coming to

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:01.000
Xbox Live Arcade and Playstation Network, I mean,

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.000
come on, they're putting in the work to do it now,

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:05.000
they're gonna do it. And,

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.000
once this comes, then Vice City and then

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:09.000
San Andreas, and that's just gonna be amazing.

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.000
Um, one other ridiculous

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:13.000
thing though that they're having is they're having a 1-6

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:15.000
scale, uh, action figure you can

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.000
buy, uh, Claude

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.000
from the, uh, hero, I guess

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:21.000
of the first game, and of course,

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:23.000
comes with outfits and guns and stuff like that,

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.000
for a hundred and fucking fifty dollars.

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:27.000
Not worth it, but, uh,

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:29.000
if you're a really big fan, and I'm a huge

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:31.000
fan of Grand Theft Auto, but I'm not paying

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:33.000
a hundred and fifty dollars for a fucking toy.

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:35.000
No.

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:37.000
So.

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:39.000
Oh well. It looks neat though.

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:43.000
Uh, yeah.

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:45.000
I, I guess, uh,

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:47.000
any extra money they can get out of that

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:49.000
franchise, they will, right?

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:51.000
Uh, exactly. Um, I, I would

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:53.000
be, I would love to play the game. Apparently

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:55.000
though, they're gonna be porting the game later on to

01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:57.000
other, um, platforms, you know, like the

01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:59.000
just the regular iPhone 4 and stuff like that,

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:01.000
but it's not gonna be as pretty.

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:03.000
Um,

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:05.000
and it, I do think that, uh, it does

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.000
support some of the blue, uh,

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:09.000
maybe some of the Bluetooth controllers and stuff like that,

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000
so that'd be kinda cool to actually play with buttons, but

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.000
I really just want it to come to

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:15.000
Xbox Live Arcade. Really, I would just say

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:17.000
skip 3 and Vice City, just,

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:19.000
just bring San Andreas. San Andreas

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:21.000
multiplayer, you don't even need to put out a grand theft of

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:23.000
five anytime soon. People would eat

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:25.000
that up. Alright.

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:27.000
Uh, moving on to Apple

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:29.000
related news, other iOS news,

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:31.000
uh, this has to do with Game Center,

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.000
which got some minor upgrades in the whole

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:35.000
iOS 5 thing, uh, but nothing

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.000
really to scream about. I mean, yay, it

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.000
shows you your total achievement points now in comparison

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.000
to others, and you can have your own little

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.000
picture. Whoopee. But

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:45.000
you gotta wonder if maybe there was other

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:47.000
stuff that was supposed to come, because some patents

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:49.000
that Apple had filed, uh, was talking about

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:51.000
avatars, uh, little avatars

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:53.000
on Game Centers, you know, where you could, like, have little hats

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:55.000
and hair, pretty much the exact same thing,

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:57.000
you know, with the, uh, Xbox avatars, and the,

01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:59.000
the me's on the Wii.

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:01.000
Uh, that is apparently something that Apple

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:03.000
was, or is looking at

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:05.000
for Game Center. Uh, the patents were originally

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:07.000
filed in April,

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:09.000
but obviously we didn't see this in

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:11.000
iOS 5, so either it was scrapped, or

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.000
who knows. Uh... You know what those remind me of?

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:15.000
They remind me of the little figures,

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:17.000
or the characters from, uh, Tiny Tower.

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:19.000
Oh, kinda,

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.000
yeah, cause Tiny Tower kinda has that thing going on

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.000
with it, but, um, I, I gotta say

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.000
honestly, this is just, okay,

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000
it's just another version of the me, you know,

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:29.000
avatar somewhere else, woohoo.

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.000
So, whatever. Game Center's

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:33.000
kind of, uh, I don't know, there's

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:35.000
just not, not a lot to get excited about

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:37.000
with Game Center. I mean, I get that Apple's

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:39.000
kinda trying to, like, like, standardize

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:41.000
things, but you look at what's going on with things

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:43.000
like Open Feint, and you're kinda like, wow,

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:45.000
there's, they seem to be pushing the envelope a lot

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:47.000
faster, and doing other, you know,

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.000
exciting things with it, but the problem with Open Feint

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:51.000
is that, because it's not

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:53.000
tied into the iOS, it kinda

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:55.000
sometimes can get in the way, and is distracting,

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:57.000
and a lot of games really push it, when you're like,

01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:59.000
you know what, I'm just, I'm not interested in all that.

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.000
So, I don't know.

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:03.000
This is something I've noticed amongst my iOS gaming.

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:05.000
Alright,

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.000
DarkSakura, what do you got for us?

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:09.000
We have a few things, well,

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:11.000
really just one thing, but it has to do with, uh,

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:13.000
Eve Online. There is, um,

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:15.000
an offer going out

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:17.000
for lapsed Eve Online

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:19.000
users to save money.

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:21.000
So basically, if they reactivate

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:23.000
their account, um,

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:25.000
they pay $4.95 for 30 days

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:27.000
instead of $14.95.

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:29.000
So, I guess

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:31.000
it's just to get people back in for

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:33.000
that month and see if it keeps them hooked.

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:37.000
It's very interesting.

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:39.000
Well, I'm sure when

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:41.000
there's all these other MMOs going on,

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:43.000
you know, and of course, launches coming up

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:45.000
like Star Wars and so forth,

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:47.000
you know, these aging

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:49.000
MMOs have to do everything they can to kind of get

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:51.000
people to look at it again,

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:53.000
you know. Yeah. But of course, Eve has

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:55.000
that whole spin-off coming to the PlayStation 3

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:57.000
they were talking about at E3. That's true.

01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:59.000
So, that is right there. It's probably gonna get

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:01.000
a lot of people kind of looking back at Eve, I'm sure.

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:03.000
Possibly.

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:05.000
So, Sony is apparently looking for,

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:07.000
um, or possibly

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:09.000
mulling around, if you will,

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:11.000
an idea where people

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:13.000
can actually

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:15.000
get a discount on purchasing

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:17.000
UMD games

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:19.000
on the Vita

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:21.000
if you currently own the actual

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:23.000
UMD game.

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:25.000
This is coming from the Japanese language fact

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:27.000
that's posted, I guess,

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:29.000
on Sony's PlayStation website.

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:31.000
They're saying that the fact

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:33.000
notes that they're considering a service to offer

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:35.000
PSN versions of UMD games

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:37.000
users

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:39.000
own for a special price. This is in

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:41.000
the confirmation, obviously, but

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:43.000
it's something that they're considering details

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:45.000
of the service will be announced later.

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:47.000
I don't know how the hell they're gonna be able to do that, but

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:49.000
maybe you have to pop it in your

01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:51.000
PSP and it

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:53.000
recognizes it's there or something like that.

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:55.000
I don't know how that really

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:57.000
works, but, uh,

01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:59.000
yeah. It says, I guess,

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:01.000
also it says that the Vita will

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:03.000
play all downloadable PSP games

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:05.000
except for game

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:07.000
archives, which I guess

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:09.000
is, um, the

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:11.000
Japanese label for the PlayStation

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:13.000
1 classics, Neo Geo games,

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:15.000
and retro downloads.

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:17.000
So, you're not gonna be able to

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:19.000
play your PlayStation 1 games, I guess.

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:21.000
But maybe they're gonna have a

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:23.000
different way to play them later on or something.

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:27.000
Oh well. That's too bad.

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.000
Uh, not surprising,

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:31.000
though. Well, it's hard to

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:33.000
port out the backwards, you know.

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:35.000
It's akin to the whole PlayStation 2 games that are now

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:37.000
showing up on PlayStation 3. You know, I don't know.

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:39.000
It's kinda what it reminds me of.

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:41.000
Alright, one more story for you guys.

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:43.000
Then we're gonna open up the Skype line at

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:45.000
1877 Game OLR or a username on Skype,

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:47.000
Orange Lounge Radio, and this has to do with

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:49.000
the game in the world of South

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:51.000
Park. You know, South Park gets these games

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:53.000
once in a while. In fact, they had an Xbox Live arcade

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:55.000
game. It was the Tower Defense game, and I

02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:57.000
can't remember the name of it. Let's Go Tower Defense

02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:59.000
Play. That was it. Uh, that was out,

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:01.000
what, about two years ago? Well, a

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:03.000
new South Park game was announced for Xbox

02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:05.000
Live Arcade. It's supposed to be coming out next spring.

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:07.000
It's called South Park, Tenorman's

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:09.000
Revenge. Do you remember

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:11.000
Scott Tenorman? That was the character

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:13.000
where his parents were chopped up, and

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:15.000
Cartman fed the parents

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:17.000
in the chili to Scott Tenorman. That was one of

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:19.000
the most fucked up episodes of

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:21.000
South Park that there was. What was the play on

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:23.000
Titus, right? One of

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:25.000
those movies that had come out around

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:27.000
the same time, and it was

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:29.000
one of those so sick

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:31.000
it was funny. Yeah.

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:33.000
Anyhow,

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:35.000
I guess it was being shown

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:37.000
at Comic Con, and some

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:39.000
screenshots have come out of it.

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:41.000
It looks like it might be a little more of a platformer.

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:43.000
They have a trailer for it. It's actually

02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:45.000
pretty cool looking. And ManBearPig is in it.

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:47.000
Oh, is there a trailer? There is a trailer for it.

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:49.000
Let me find it.

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:51.000
It was pretty

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:53.000
cool looking. It looks like a

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:55.000
four player side-scroller

02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:57.000
game. Okay, here we go.

02:01:57.000 --> 02:01:59.000
Got a trailer here. Let's take a look.

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:09.000
Is he building a robot? Oh, I see.

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:23.000
Begin ginger vacation.

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:25.000
Nice.

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:33.000
There's some gameplay.

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:35.000
It looks like it might be four player simultaneous.

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:37.000
Yeah. It's kind of what it looks like.

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:39.000
You can play as the goon.

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:43.000
That might be cute. A lot of those

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:45.000
South Park games are kind of dopey.

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:47.000
God, there was one that was especially

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:49.000
terrible. What was it on? I want to

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:51.000
say it was on the Nintendo 64.

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:53.000
It was some South Park kart racing game.

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:55.000
Not even that. That was pretty bad too.

02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:57.000
There was like a first person shooter game.

02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:59.000
It wasn't a kart racing game. It was a first person shooter.

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:01.000
It was really, it was a special kind of terrible.

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:03.000
Like, it was

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:05.000
really bad.

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:07.000
So yeah, hopefully it's better than that.

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:09.000
Alright.

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:11.000
Oh, even TigerClaw in our chatroom at chat.ornsauceready.com

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:13.000
just brought that game up.

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:15.000
The N64 game and Rama's like, I remember that.

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:17.000
Yeah, I'd like to forget that that ever happened.

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:19.000
Thanks.

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:21.000
Alright, Skype line is open. 1-877-GAME-OLR

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:23.000
or our username on Skype is

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:25.000
OrangeLoungeRadio if you want to give us a call.

02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:27.000
Talk about anything that we've talked about tonight

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:29.000
so far on the show or maybe something that we

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:31.000
missed that you were hoping we would talk about.

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:33.000
I don't know. Meanwhile, going to

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:35.000
some Twitter topics.

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:37.000
Which I'm signed into the wrong account.

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:39.000
I was about to read tweets that were sent to me.

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:41.000
Not to the show.

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:43.000
Oh Rob, you're being a diva.

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:45.000
Are you reading my mother's Twitter?

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:49.000
No.

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:51.000
Alright.

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:53.000
Going to some tweets. We have a couple tweets here

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:55.000
from TigerClaw305. He always likes to

02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:57.000
tweet us some stories that

02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:59.000
otherwise might slip through the cracks.

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:01.000
The first one that he tweeted us is about a

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:03.000
Spider-Man video game. The Amazing Spider-Man

02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:05.000
video game coming in 2012.

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:07.000
It's supposed to be open world.

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:09.000
And I guess there's teaser posters all over New York Comic-Con

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:11.000
about it. Obviously the new movie

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:13.000
because they're rebooting the franchise

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:15.000
that wasn't that dead. But whatever.

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:17.000
They're rebooting it in 2012.

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:19.000
So that's on it's way. They also have a trailer for that too.

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:21.000
Is there really? Let me see if we can

02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:23.000
find. Well, hold on. Because we're getting a call.

02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:25.000
I'll look for a trailer for this

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:27.000
while we take our call. But we do have

02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:29.000
a call coming in. So let's go do it. Hi, you're on

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:31.000
Orange Launch Radio. Who's this? Hey, it's DJ

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:33.000
Ron Mess from Anime Jam Session. How are you

02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:35.000
guys doing tonight? I am Fantastic Rama.

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:37.000
How are you doing?

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:39.000
I am tired. I am sitting

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:41.000
here pouring over photos,

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:43.000
pouring over videos, and sipping

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:45.000
my spiked apple juice.

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:47.000
Now you were at New York Comic-Con

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:49.000
this weekend, right? Yes, I was.

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:51.000
All four days. And are you working on your Fernando

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:53.000
cosplay?

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:55.000
No. And screw you

02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:57.000
Loki. No. No.

02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:59.000
No. No.

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:01.000
Alright. You know we

02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:03.000
just gotta give you a hard time.

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:05.000
Besides, I have a Buddha belly so that ain't

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:07.000
happening anytime soon. Alright.

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:09.000
Well, how was the con? Tell us about

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:11.000
it. Okay, first, I gotta ask. Did you play

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:13.000
Bungee Ferret Tossing? Yes.

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:15.000
Yes, I did. And, um, we do

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:17.000
have a demo video

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:19.000
up. Woohoo!

02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:21.000
And I just posted it in the chat

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:23.000
room. Was this blessed by YYR?

02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:25.000
Yes. Yes, it was.

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:27.000
Okay, just making sure. Alright. Plus, I am

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:29.000
also press so, you know.

02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:31.000
Oh, I see. Oh, you're a press.

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:33.000
Oh yeah, because you're Anime Jam Session.

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:35.000
Alright, let's see what this is.

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:37.000
Action.

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:39.000
Okay, first off, you wanna cut out

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:41.000
the guy that says action. You do know that, right?

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:43.000
You do realize I'm up

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:45.000
here rushing trying to get the video

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:47.000
online. Alright, alright,

02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:49.000
alright. I love the poster in the background

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:51.000
too. How long is your snake?

02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:53.000
That's also, he also

02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:55.000
has it as a shirt. Clever.

02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:57.000
Clever. We're going to check

02:05:57.000 --> 02:05:59.000
out OLR's exclusive game

02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:01.000
Bungee Ferret Tossing.

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:03.000
Were

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:05.000
you playing this in a hardboat?

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:07.000
Oh, we're watching it.

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:13.000
And so you're

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:15.000
kind of moving around on the helicopter. It doesn't look like

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:17.000
things are going too crazy on the ground right now.

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:19.000
Oh, there are the ferrets.

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:21.000
It's kind of interesting

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:23.000
this strikes me as like a

02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:25.000
mix between like a twin stick shooter

02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:27.000
like Geometry Wars where you're trying to dodge

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:29.000
all the bullets. But yet

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:31.000
it's a whole different

02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:33.000
element. Like you don't shoot the same way.

02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:35.000
It's like this mixture of

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:37.000
defender and Geometry Wars.

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:43.000
We can't fix the chopper in battle

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:45.000
so be careful. Now the blood

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:47.000
splats aren't really coming through very well on this

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:49.000
video but still.

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:53.000
Nice. Triple.

02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:57.000
Very cool. Tell us

02:06:57.000 --> 02:06:59.000
a little more. You can see the ground is all bloody. That's awesome.

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:01.000
Tell us a little more while we

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:03.000
watch the rest of this game play

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:05.000
video here.

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:07.000
I have to say that is one of the most bloodiest

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:09.000
8-bit style video games I

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:11.000
have played in a very long

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:13.000
time. Which is a good thing. If it has our

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:15.000
name on it, it better.

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:19.000
Awesome.

02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:21.000
What else did you see in New York Comic Con?

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:23.000
Some other stuff but before I continue

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:25.000
if you notice

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:27.000
the ferret that

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:29.000
Fernando is tossing looks familiar

02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:31.000
if you follow Naruto.

02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:33.000
Really? Oh is it?

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:35.000
That is hers isn't it?

02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:37.000
Yes it is. Awesome.

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:39.000
Well of course

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:41.000
it's a video game.

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:43.000
There's got to be a Naruto reference in it at someplace.

02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:45.000
But there's a kill counter.

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:47.000
You killed

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:49.000
21 terrorists. Oh 22.

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:51.000
Nice.

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:53.000
And a few ninjas. What else did you

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:55.000
see at the con over 4 days?

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:57.000
Final Fantasy 13 2.

02:07:57.000 --> 02:07:59.000
Oh nice. How was that?

02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:01.000
You can jump in this game.

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:03.000
It's about freaking

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:05.000
time.

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:07.000
I thought Square Enix didn't know how

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:09.000
to handle jumping.

02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:11.000
I played the

02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:13.000
demo. It was pretty fun

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:15.000
and I hate to say it

02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:17.000
I am not saying this as a

02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:19.000
360 fanboy. But they did

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:21.000
have the 360 and the

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:23.000
PS3 versions both sitting

02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:25.000
on display. Same model

02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:27.000
TVs. And looks like

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:29.000
the graphics in the 360 version

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:31.000
looks a little bit sharper. A little bit crisper.

02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:33.000
Interesting. Because usually

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:35.000
you would think with the whole Blu-ray stuff that it

02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:37.000
would look a little better on the Playstation 3.

02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:39.000
Pretty much. And I was kind of shocked

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:41.000
by that. Very interesting.

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:43.000
What else?

02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:45.000
Any other games that you got your hands on while you were

02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:47.000
out there? Like maybe Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom

02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:49.000
or whatever else they were showing there?

02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:51.000
I could not get on the line for that.

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:53.000
And one of my staffers who was covering

02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:55.000
games, he got sick over the weekend

02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:57.000
so he could not finish up all the game coverage.

02:08:57.000 --> 02:08:59.000
Oh no.

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:01.000
But here's something interesting.

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:03.000
Now, I've

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:05.000
ran into some friends of mine and they're

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:07.000
all dressed as characters from

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:09.000
Mega Man Legends. Right. Oh boy.

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:11.000
They actually went to the Capcom

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:13.000
booth and protested them

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:15.000
canceling Mega Man Legends 3.

02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:17.000
They should have

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:19.000
occupied Capcom. Yeah, occupied

02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:21.000
Capcom. Is that what was going

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:23.000
on? One of them

02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:25.000
actually had a sign. I might have taken a picture

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:27.000
of it. Occupied Capcom. Nice.

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:29.000
We are the 99%

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:31.000
of gamers that want a new Mega Man game.

02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:33.000
Nice.

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:35.000
And they're all walking around

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:37.000
the convention center trying to

02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:39.000
get people to follow

02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:41.000
with them. And I saw one of them

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:43.000
and I said, you do realize

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:45.000
it's not going to happen, right?

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:47.000
And they're like, you shut up, it'll

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:49.000
happen! And I'm like, sure it will.

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:51.000
Sure it will.

02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:53.000
It's going to be a lot harder once

02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:55.000
certain individuals have left

02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:57.000
Capcom, but okay, okay.

02:09:57.000 --> 02:09:59.000
Yeah, pretty much. Nice.

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:01.000
But they didn't get thrown out of the booth?

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:03.000
No, not at all. That's good.

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:05.000
I was thinking maybe there was going to be some drama,

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:07.000
some throw down, some cops called.

02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:09.000
No, no, no.

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:11.000
We were too far away

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:13.000
from that. I see, I see.

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:15.000
Alright.

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:17.000
Well, I don't know what else to ask you about the con.

02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:19.000
Anything else you want to share with us tonight?

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:21.000
Uh, let's see.

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:23.000
Well,

02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:25.000
I would say

02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:27.000
cosplays. The most popular

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:29.000
gaming cosplay I saw this weekend

02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:31.000
was pretty much

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:33.000
Link, Mario,

02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:35.000
and Peach.

02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:37.000
So just kind of your traditional Nintendo

02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:39.000
characters. Very traditional.

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:41.000
Yeah.

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:43.000
Also, there's this one guy, he cosplays

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:45.000
the red trainer from

02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:47.000
Pokemon. He actually was walking

02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:49.000
around the convention center with his

02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:51.000
bike playing the Pokemon theme

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:53.000
as you're walking through as you're playing the game.

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:55.000
That background music. Oh my god.

02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:57.000
Nice. I thought that was pretty

02:10:57.000 --> 02:10:59.000
cool. Sounds pretty intricate to me.

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:01.000
Eh, he's one step

02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:03.000
up. I would be too lazy to do something

02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:05.000
like that.

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:07.000
At least you're honest.

02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:09.000
Pretty much. Alright my friend, well do you have anything else

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:11.000
you want to share with us tonight before I let you go?

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:13.000
Uh, not now,

02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:15.000
but I think I'm waiting

02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:17.000
on a response from somebody

02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:19.000
to hear some other interesting information. As soon as I hear it,

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:21.000
you'll be the first to know. Alright.

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:23.000
Hmm. Interesting. Alright. Keep me posted.

02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:25.000
Will do. Alright. Later buddy.

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:27.000
You got it bro.

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:29.000
1877 Game OLR. Our username

02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:31.000
on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio if you

02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:33.000
want to give us a call. I'm very appreciative of

02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:35.000
the video of Bungee Ferret Tossing since we weren't

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:37.000
there to play it. I'm excited that

02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:39.000
it's only going to be a dollar.

02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:41.000
That's a bargain price for a game.

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:43.000
I love that YYR is doing that.

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:45.000
Really is a labor of love for the craft

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:47.000
of creating games. That's awesome.

02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:49.000
Back to the Twitter at Twitter.com

02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:51.000
slash OLR. Another tweet

02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:53.000
coming to us from Tigerclaw

02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:55.000
who links us to this article on

02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:57.000
Gamasutra

02:11:57.000 --> 02:11:59.000
about a mobile game

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:01.000
that promotes social network safety

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:03.000
for children. I thought we had something similar

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:05.000
to this last week, but I don't think it's quite the same thing.

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:07.000
Because I think this one is now an iOS

02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:09.000
game that's coming out and it's

02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:11.000
about Be Seen, which is like a

02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:13.000
network. And I guess it's like telling people

02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:15.000
not to share all their personal

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:17.000
shit online.

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:19.000
You know what I mean?

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:21.000
You know, because some kids don't really know better.

02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:23.000
Right? So

02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:25.000
you got to teach them how to handle

02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:27.000
social networking appropriately.

02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:29.000
So.

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:31.000
Alright. Let's go to another call.

02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:33.000
We're getting more calls on the line here, so we'll go to another one.

02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:35.000
Hi, you're on Orange Challenge Radio. Who's this?

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:37.000
Hey, it's CD Thunder. Hey, CD Thunder.

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:39.000
What's on your mind, buddy?

02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:41.000
Not much. I have a couple of things I'd like to talk about.

02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:43.000
Alright. What's up?

02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:45.000
Well, I went to the

02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:47.000
mall today and there's an arcade

02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:49.000
game that I just couldn't stop playing. I was like,

02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:51.000
oh, man, this is so good.

02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:53.000
I got to keep playing. You know what I mean?

02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:55.000
Yeah, of course. What game is that?

02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:57.000
I'm not sure if you've heard of it. It's called Paradise

02:12:57.000 --> 02:12:59.000
Lost.

02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:01.000
I don't think I have heard of that. Tell me the

02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:03.000
set up for this.

02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:05.000
It's basically you're

02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:07.000
the survivor on an island

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:09.000
and you go from gun to gun

02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:11.000
and just mowing down all these guys.

02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:13.000
That's

02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:15.000
all you pretty much do. And then you

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:17.000
get these different bosses, like helicopters

02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:19.000
and stuff.

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:21.000
So it's

02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:23.000
pretty basic. But there's one

02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:25.000
boss that's called the Chucker and it's this

02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:27.000
mutant looking thing that

02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:29.000
just throws

02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:31.000
exploding barrels at you. I'm finding

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:33.000
that this is apparently Paradise Lost

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:35.000
is a arcade version

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:37.000
of the series Far Cry

02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:39.000
and specifically Far Cry Instincts.

02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:41.000
So now the way you're describing the game kind of

02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:43.000
makes a lot of sense. So this is some type

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:45.000
of like port to it, I guess.

02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:47.000
It's a rail shooter arcade game port

02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:49.000
of Far Cry Instincts and

02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:51.000
it was made in 2007

02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:53.000
and I guess it uses hardware very similar

02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:55.000
to Aliens Extermination. So

02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:57.000
kind of neat.

02:13:57.000 --> 02:13:59.000
Well, it would be kind of cool if

02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:01.000
they actually put Paradise Lost on the Wii

02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:03.000
or some other system because

02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:05.000
it's just a lot of fun.

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:07.000
It's very addicting. Well, just so you know,

02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:09.000
if you do really like the game, you might want to check out the

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:11.000
Far Cry series. Far Cry Instincts was on

02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:13.000
the original Xbox, not the 360

02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:15.000
but the old, old Xbox.

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:17.000
It was actually made in like 2005.

02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:19.000
So if you like those type of games, you know, you

02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:21.000
like that, you might enjoy the Far Cry series

02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:23.000
which, you know, they're still making

02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:25.000
those games. Like Far Cry 3 is

02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:27.000
coming out

02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:29.000
next year. I don't think it's out

02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:31.000
yet. No, it's definitely not out yet but it's coming

02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:33.000
out soon. Wasn't that the one they were showing the

02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:35.000
big trailer for and it was like really

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:37.000
creepster looking. They kicked the guy down the

02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:39.000
cave. Was that Far Cry? Or am I mixing it up

02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:41.000
with another series? I think it was.

02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:43.000
I think it was.

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:45.000
I don't know off hand. Anyway, sorry

02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:47.000
CD Thunder, don't mean to digress. What else did you

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:49.000
check out?

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:51.000
That was the only arcade game that

02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:53.000
I want to talk about but

02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:55.000
the next thing I'd like to discuss is what

02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:57.000
I think would make a really good game.

02:14:57.000 --> 02:14:59.000
Alrighty.

02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:01.000
I'm not sure if you agree with me on this but

02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:03.000
what if somebody combined House of the

02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:05.000
Dead and CarnEvil and put, and made

02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:07.000
them, made it just one game.

02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:09.000
That would already be House of the

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:11.000
Dead. House of the Dead.

02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:13.000
How so Dark Sakura? Because it's kind

02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:15.000
of like the shooter and everything.

02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:17.000
Or maybe I'm picturing in what

02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:19.000
CD Thunder is describing like an

02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:21.000
evil carnival maybe. Like a

02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:23.000
possessed, I guess that is carnival

02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:25.000
isn't it?

02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:27.000
Well the thing is

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:29.000
I think carnival just needs more zombies.

02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:31.000
The thing is

02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:33.000
you go through the House of the Dead

02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:35.000
and along the way you find this girl

02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:37.000
and

02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:39.000
you rescue her and she'd be

02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:41.000
tag along with you throughout the

02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:43.000
entire rest

02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:45.000
of the game and then you think you're done

02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:47.000
and then one of the evil

02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:49.000
characters from the CarnEvil

02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:51.000
game comes out and

02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:53.000
kidnaps her and then you have to go

02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:55.000
in there and rescue her.

02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:57.000
So it'd be one long game instead of just

02:15:57.000 --> 02:15:59.000
two separate ones. Well you should

02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:01.000
tweet the idea to Sega because

02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:03.000
anything is possible through Twitter. That's something we've

02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:05.000
learned very recently.

02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:07.000
Alright.

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:09.000
Well, CD Thunder buddy I'm gonna let you

02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:11.000
go so we can get more calls. Do you have any final thoughts?

02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:15.000
Um

02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:17.000
Is it, can I plug something?

02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:19.000
Okay.

02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:21.000
It's another gaming

02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:23.000
podcast. It's called 4 Player Podcast.

02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:25.000
It's really

02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:27.000
good, not that I'm saying that

02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:29.000
I'm not saying that this one isn't really good

02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:31.000
but it's another really good one.

02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:33.000
No, I'm familiar with

02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:35.000
that show. It is a fine show

02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:37.000
and I think some of their folks follow me

02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:39.000
on Twitter and vice versa so

02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:41.000
they do a lot with the Justin TV

02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:43.000
integration which is something

02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:45.000
we kinda used to do but our radio

02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:47.000
show is not that exciting to watch

02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:49.000
so getting a webcam back here hasn't exactly

02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:51.000
been a high priority for us but they're a little

02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:53.000
better at integrating all the video, the actual

02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:55.000
gameplay and all of that so

02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:57.000
Well if you had a webcam everybody could see

02:16:57.000 --> 02:16:59.000
Shermie.

02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:01.000
Maybe we just need a Shermie cam. We'll put

02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:03.000
a camera under the table and you can see

02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:05.000
my feet and Shermie. We'll think about that.

02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:07.000
That's a good suggestion. Alright, later buddy.

02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:09.000
Bye. Bye.

02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:11.000
1877 game OLR or a username

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:13.000
on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio if you

02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:15.000
wanna give us a call and

02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:17.000
I think we're out of tweets.

02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:19.000
Not a lot of people tweeting us this week.

02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:21.000
Although I will say this. This actually came in earlier

02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:23.000
in the week. Zushi13

02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:25.000
had tweeted us saying, I got to play some bungee

02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:27.000
ferret toss. It's a really fun game.

02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:29.000
Oh,

02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:31.000
13forever tweeted us

02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:33.000
saying, Sweet! Scribblenuts for iOS

02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:35.000
Scribblenuts. Scribblenuts

02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:37.000
for iOS is real and ready

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:39.000
for install and tweets us that yeah

02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:41.000
Scribblenuts came out on the iOS this week. I remember

02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:43.000
seeing that in the app store. Now my

02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:45.000
iPhone broke this week.

02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:47.000
My sleep button no longer works

02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:49.000
and it's really

02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:51.000
killed my desire to spend a lot of money

02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:53.000
on iOS products right now

02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:55.000
especially when I can't get a new iPhone until January.

02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:57.000
And I was talking about this a little bit on

02:17:57.000 --> 02:17:59.000
Bobby's show but

02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:01.000
you know I'm not exactly in a

02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:03.000
rush to replace my iPhone. In fact

02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:05.000
now I'm thinking maybe I want a different phone.

02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:07.000
But yet I've spent all that money on apps.

02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:09.000
I don't know what to do.

02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:11.000
I guess we'll just

02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:13.000
take another call. Hi you're on Orange Lawns Radio. Who's this?

02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:15.000
This is Shane. Hey

02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:17.000
Shane, what's up?

02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:19.000
Not a whole lot. I just wanted to

02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:21.000
say the word Skylanders so I could

02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:23.000
hear the rant that Loki went on earlier

02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:25.000
than I missed. That's your fault for not being here at

02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:27.000
6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.

02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:29.000
I had a work thing

02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:31.000
I had to go to. It was pizza.

02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:33.000
Like I was going to pass up pizza.

02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:37.000
Well, Loki?

02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:39.000
Heard he made a rant.

02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:41.000
I'm just saying, you know

02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:43.000
yeah it's cool that your store sold out

02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:45.000
of them or whatever.

02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:47.000
I hope those four copies

02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:49.000
went pretty fast.

02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:51.000
I had more than four copies. I had like

02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:53.000
eight on PS3

02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:55.000
eight on 360, eight on Wii and four on

02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:57.000
3DS and then all the little

02:18:57.000 --> 02:18:59.000
freaking boxes of the single

02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:01.000
figurines. Do you have games?

02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:03.000
I mean that eight doesn't sound like a lot.

02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:05.000
Of course granted you're in Kansas but

02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:07.000
I'm just saying it's six because they came

02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:09.000
in case slots of six so

02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:11.000
that's only one

02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:13.000
case of each. That's not a lot.

02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:15.000
I'm curious if there's other games

02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:17.000
that maybe have the potential to sell eight copies

02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:19.000
in a day. I mean that doesn't sound like that many.

02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:21.000
Well across multiple

02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:23.000
systems on a Sunday release

02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:25.000
that's not a Nintendo game is

02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:27.000
pretty significant. I'm optimistic

02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:29.000
that they're going to fail still.

02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:31.000
Although I did see a review

02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:33.000
from some site. It's the

02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:35.000
only review that they have right now that's like eight

02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:37.000
out of ten.

02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:39.000
Like Kotaku for example

02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:41.000
they're like, I think this concept is pretty awesome.

02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:43.000
Yeah, you think it's pretty awesome because they sent

02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:45.000
you five fucking copies of the game and all the

02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:47.000
toys. Well this looks like fun.

02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:49.000
The kid in me wants to open

02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:51.000
this up.

02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:53.000
Okay, fine, whatever.

02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:55.000
But reading the feedback from

02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:57.000
people that are looking at the trailers and stuff

02:19:57.000 --> 02:19:59.000
they're like, what the fuck happened to Spyro?

02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:01.000
What have they done to this guy?

02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:03.000
It's pretty mean now and like the

02:20:03.000 --> 02:20:05.000
3DS one comes with a black version like

02:20:05.000 --> 02:20:07.000
an evil Spyro or something.

02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:09.000
And that was kind of

02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:11.000
cool looking but he still didn't look like Spyro.

02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:13.000
Let me kind of

02:20:13.000 --> 02:20:15.000
turn this on you and ask you about something that we

02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:17.000
also talked about in the beginning of the show. No, yes.

02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:19.000
Because last week on the show you were here defending Final Fantasy

02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:21.000
XIV and saying I should play it again.

02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:23.000
And I did. And I talked about that

02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:25.000
at the top of the show. Which you said was pretty

02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:27.000
negative sounding. Well, it mixed.

02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:29.000
I would say I gave it a mixed review because there are

02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:31.000
things I like about it. Like the

02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:33.000
whole way you can mix and match

02:20:33.000 --> 02:20:35.000
your talents. And I thought there's so much

02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:37.000
more to do for a single player now.

02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:39.000
And I realized that a lot of the crafting

02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:41.000
jobs are really there for the single player

02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:43.000
experience. Like you're not exactly going to party up

02:20:43.000 --> 02:20:45.000
to go do botany together.

02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:47.000
Like that's really part of the single player game.

02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:49.000
Ooh, but we should because that would be hilarious.

02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:51.000
But my

02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:53.000
real question for you is

02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:55.000
and then just so you know the bottom line is it's

02:20:55.000 --> 02:20:57.000
better and it's much better than fucking garbage

02:20:57.000 --> 02:20:59.000
which is what I called it last time. But

02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:01.000
I'm not going to pay the monthly fee.

02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:03.000
And that was the news that came out this week is that

02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:05.000
now they're charging a monthly fee for Final Fantasy XIV.

02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:07.000
You didn't know that last week. What's

02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:09.000
your reaction to all the news about Final Fantasy

02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:11.000
XIV this week?

02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:13.000
In regards to the monthly fee

02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:15.000
I feel like it's way too early

02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:17.000
and I also feel like that's

02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:19.000
not what the dev team

02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:21.000
was going for

02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:23.000
because recently in a post

02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:25.000
they said that the game's

02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:27.000
only like halfway to where they want it to be

02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:29.000
and they weren't going to start charging a fee till it was

02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:31.000
100% that way. So clearly that came

02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:33.000
from the top down.

02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:35.000
I don't feel like

02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:37.000
it's really ready for a monthly fee

02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:39.000
but I will pay it because I am

02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:41.000
having fun. And

02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:43.000
in terms of like the other things

02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:45.000
they announced like completely rebooting the game

02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:47.000
again, I'm actually kind of

02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:49.000
excited for that because the one fake little

02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:51.000
screenshot they made looked really cool

02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:53.000
and they're adding classes I care about

02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:55.000
and it's more Final Fantasy now.

02:21:55.000 --> 02:21:57.000
It sounds like

02:21:57.000 --> 02:21:59.000
really Final Fantasy XI

02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:01.000
II with all the changes

02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:03.000
they're doing. You know I got to admit from that

02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:05.000
screenshot I don't know why but I was thinking

02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:07.000
like it looked like Phantasy Star Online

02:22:07.000 --> 02:22:09.000
with Final Fantasy characters. That would be

02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:11.000
amazing especially since we

02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:13.000
probably aren't getting Phantasy Star Online 2.

02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:15.000
It was one sexy looking screenshot.

02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:17.000
It is a concept

02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:19.000
I mean it's not until

02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:21.000
it's in my hot little hands.

02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:23.000
And it seems weird to me that they're going to make the graphics

02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:25.000
look better yet allow the game to run

02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:27.000
on lower end PCs. It's just about

02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:29.000
optimization though from what I understand.

02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:31.000
This game is horribly optimized for

02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:33.000
anything. Once again though

02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:35.000
we're talking like a year's time

02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:37.000
that this thing is going to be

02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:39.000
fully rebooted. I mean

02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:41.000
I just can only imagine

02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:43.000
the games are going to look still even

02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:45.000
better than they are now.

02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:47.000
To me it's almost

02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:49.000
like the

02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:51.000
Wii U I guess. You know how they're kind of late

02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:53.000
to the game with everything and it's like

02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:55.000
oh look we're pushing these HD graphics

02:22:55.000 --> 02:22:57.000
that everyone else has been putting out for like

02:22:57.000 --> 02:22:59.000
years now.

02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:01.000
It kind of seems like to me.

02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:03.000
But it still looks sexy.

02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:05.000
Will it be good enough for me to play?

02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:07.000
Well it does have the uniqueness of being a Japanese MMO

02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:09.000
that's pretty big here in the states.

02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:11.000
You know at least Final Fantasy 11 is.

02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:13.000
You know and there's not a lot of

02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:15.000
Asian in general no matter what

02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:17.000
country MMOs that do

02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:19.000
very well here. Most of the MMOs that are doing

02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:21.000
well here are developed by

02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:23.000
studios that are here. Like WoW

02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:25.000
of course is the big one developed by Blizzard.

02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:27.000
So you know I don't know.

02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:29.000
I guess

02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:31.000
that was really all I wanted to ask you was about

02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:33.000
Final Fantasy 14 and where you're at with that.

02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:35.000
So are you going to be paying for WoW and Final Fantasy

02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:37.000
14 or are you saying you're like

02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:39.000
into 14 so much you might cancel WoW?

02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:41.000
Yeah I might.

02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:43.000
It depends on what Blizzcon says this week.

02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:45.000
And

02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:47.000
how fun 4.3 is.

02:23:47.000 --> 02:23:49.000
Also when it comes out

02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:51.000
because who knows how long that is. But I'm just sick of

02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:53.000
you know grinding rep in

02:23:53.000 --> 02:23:55.000
Firelands and

02:23:55.000 --> 02:23:57.000
jumping. So Final Fantasy

02:23:57.000 --> 02:23:59.000
14 is something pretty and distracting right now right?

02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:01.000
Yes. And it's still free

02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:03.000
because they said they'll give us ample

02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:05.000
notice of when it actually goes to pay.

02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:07.000
And I'm guessing it's more

02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:09.000
like early December instead of

02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:11.000
late November. So I still have like

02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:13.000
two months. I'm wondering

02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:15.000
how my 30 day trial is going to play into it.

02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:17.000
I totally am going to get screwed with that.

02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:19.000
Like my 30 day trial will be up and then the

02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:21.000
fee kicks in. It's like I didn't get

02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:23.000
shit. I didn't get shit

02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:25.000
like everybody else got. Oh well.

02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:27.000
Oh well I'm part of that too. I mean I've only been

02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:29.000
playing for what a week longer than you? You didn't

02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:31.000
even buy the damn game. It was conked to you.

02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:33.000
That's true. So shut up.

02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:35.000
I didn't get it for free.

02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:37.000
I paid 25 bucks for it.

02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:39.000
I paid half what most people

02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:41.000
paid for it new but I still paid 25 bucks

02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:43.000
for it. And then my DVD

02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:45.000
was damaged. And screw that.

02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:47.000
Square needs to learn

02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:49.000
how to make a PC game for fuck's sake.

02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:51.000
Alright. I do think the game

02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:53.000
is going to be pretty neat on Playstation 3.

02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:55.000
Yeah. I think I might

02:24:55.000 --> 02:24:57.000
jump to that when it comes out.

02:24:57.000 --> 02:24:59.000
Do you think the game can save itself?

02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:01.000
Like do you think a game can actually

02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:03.000
relaunch and

02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:05.000
be credible? I think

02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:07.000
I think it can.

02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:09.000
But probably not to the extent

02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:11.000
that they're hoping for.

02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:13.000
Like I think it'll bring in a few more

02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:15.000
people. It'll probably keep

02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:17.000
the current players. But it's not

02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:19.000
going to be a huge

02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:21.000
relaunch. Despite what they

02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:23.000
want. You're not going to get thousands

02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:25.000
and thousands of more people playing.

02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:27.000
I think honestly the smart thing for them to do is

02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:29.000
to go to the Guild Wars model where you're not totally

02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:31.000
free to play. But once you buy the game

02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:33.000
you get to play online for free. And they

02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:35.000
should look at doing expansions for money.

02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:37.000
Or just you know more regular content

02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:39.000
updates like what they're doing with Final Fantasy 11

02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:41.000
that cost money. And that

02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:43.000
that's how they should do it. They did that. I'd buy it.

02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:45.000
For sure. The monthly fee is not

02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:47.000
going to work for this game anymore. Except for Final Fantasy 11

02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:49.000
does those little

02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:51.000
baby expansions and still charges you

02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:53.000
a monthly fee. But Final Fantasy 11 is also

02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:55.000
a better game. Ooh

02:25:55.000 --> 02:25:57.000
that's true.

02:25:57.000 --> 02:25:59.000
It's not as pretty.

02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:01.000
Alright on that note I'm going to let you go alright?

02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:03.000
Alright. Alright take care. Bye.

02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:05.000
Alright I guess that's

02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:07.000
all I'm going to do over the Skype line tonight.

02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:09.000
Sorry to those of you that didn't get through.

02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:11.000
But why don't you think about writing us an email.

02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:13.000
Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com

02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:15.000
is the place to send us an email if you'd like.

02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:17.000
Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com or of course

02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:19.000
Twitter. We had a very empty Twitter tonight. I'm very

02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:21.000
sad. Twitter.com slash

02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:23.000
O-L-R. Alright.

02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:25.000
Well that's going to wrap up another show. I've got to

02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:27.000
ask though Dark Soccer and Loki if they have any last minute

02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:29.000
stories they want to throw out here. I've

02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:31.000
started a political social blog.

02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:33.000
Oh dear.

02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:35.000
Wait a minute. Women think independently now?

02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:37.000
I'm teasing.

02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:41.000
Girl.

02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:43.000
She's trying very hard not

02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:45.000
to laugh. Like she wants to give me that stern

02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:47.000
I hate you look but she can't do it. Rob's going to take

02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:49.000
me to Pinkberry to appease me.

02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:51.000
Whatever. Alright.

02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:53.000
Vote no on that.

02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:55.000
That's my political blog.

02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:57.000
Alright. You know I'm just giving you a hard

02:26:57.000 --> 02:26:59.000
time. Yeah I know. Good luck with that. That's what

02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:01.000
you're. I was going to

02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:03.000
do another joke but I can't.

02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:05.000
No it's my second blog. Alright.

02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:07.000
Cause my other blog's like about

02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:09.000
girly shit. Okay. Alright.

02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:11.000
Alright. Loki

02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:13.000
any last minute news you want to get into?

02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:15.000
They're supposed to be doing a

02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:17.000
Layton Brothers game for iPhone

02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:19.000
sometime soon. I'm assuming this is

02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:21.000
only going to be on the Japanese IS so.

02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:23.000
It's neat though if you

02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:25.000
want to play you know Layton.

02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:27.000
Yeah Layton's a good series. It'll be fun on the iPhone.

02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:29.000
Let me go to the chat room cause we

02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:31.000
haven't read enough of chat tonight and I apologize.

02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:33.000
I'm watching you guys but we just haven't had a whole lot

02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:35.000
of stuff I've been able to work into the show.

02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:37.000
Plus live listeners are really behind tonight.

02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:39.000
Not of any fault of your guyses. Like I just

02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:41.000
noticed the delay is like several minutes tonight

02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:43.000
so I don't know what's up. But anyway.

02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:45.000
I want to read this cause this guy said

02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:47.000
after five years listening he's finally listening to

02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:49.000
a live show. It's Swongtong

02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:51.000
his name in chat and Swongtong asks

02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:53.000
how come MMOs on Playstation

02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:55.000
3 don't use the mouse and keyboard?

02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:57.000
Actually some

02:27:57.000 --> 02:27:59.000
do and I believe Final Fantasy 14

02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:01.000
is still they're going to plan on using a keyboard

02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:03.000
even when it rolls out to the Playstation 3.

02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:05.000
And everything on

02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:07.000
Playstation 3 is all Bluetooth

02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:09.000
and USB anyway right? Like I know

02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:11.000
on Xbox 360 you can hook in a keyboard

02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:13.000
you can play Final Fantasy 11 on 360

02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:15.000
with a keyboard. I used to do that

02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:17.000
when it first came out. So

02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:19.000
as far as Playstation 3 goes you can

02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:21.000
put in a keyboard. You can

02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:23.000
type messages and so forth.

02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:25.000
As far as MMOs embracing it

02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:27.000
well maybe the keyboard adoption policy isn't

02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:29.000
maybe high enough to do that but I think for a game like

02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:31.000
Final Fantasy 14 like if I were to play that on

02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:33.000
the Playstation 3 I definitely would have to have

02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:35.000
a keyboard. Luckily I already

02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:37.000
have one that's specifically for

02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:39.000
the gaming consoles. It lights up blue it's really

02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:41.000
pretty. Alright.

02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:43.000
Loki any other stories for

02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:45.000
us tonight?

02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:47.000
No

02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:49.000
the only other story I have is not really gaming

02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:51.000
related but my wife is trying to

02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:53.000
download the version

02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:55.000
of Firefox that is British

02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:57.000
English so that all of her

02:28:57.000 --> 02:28:59.000
stuff will be spell checked into

02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:01.000
the Queen's English because she's

02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:03.000
obsessed with Game

02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:05.000
of Thrones and I don't know why.

02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:07.000
Tell her

02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:09.000
she better start learning to use more vowels.

02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:11.000
I would have put that on Dark Soccer to do

02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:13.000
something like that before Nelly.

02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:15.000
I've done it before. Okay

02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:17.000
never mind I stand clear. Well no I've actually

02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:19.000
got a British

02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:21.000
grammar checker. Okay.

02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:23.000
Because well every so

02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:25.000
okay here's a true story. Use less z's

02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:27.000
and more u's there you go.

02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:29.000
In college I actually had this whole thing

02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:31.000
where I was doing nothing but writing everything in British English

02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:33.000
and my teacher let me do it he just said pick one

02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:35.000
and write in it.

02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:37.000
So every so often

02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:39.000
less z's. Excuse me.

02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:41.000
Fewer z's.

02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:43.000
Alright.

02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:45.000
Don't use that.

02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:47.000
What? The z word.

02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:49.000
I guess that's it.

02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:51.000
So we're going around and getting everybody's final thought

02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:53.000
and wrapping up another week here at Orange Laundry.

02:29:53.000 --> 02:29:55.000
Before we do that I really want to thank you guys again

02:29:55.000 --> 02:29:57.000
for tuning in and spending another week with us.

02:29:57.000 --> 02:29:59.000
Thank you so much. You know all we ask we do this

02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:01.000
for free. You'll notice there's no advertising or

02:30:01.000 --> 02:30:03.000
anything like that except for our own other side

02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:05.000
projects. Which by the way include

02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:07.000
the best little Horde house in Azeroth at Hordehouse.com

02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:09.000
if you like your Warcraft. We had a fun show

02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:11.000
tonight. In fact we taped earlier today. This is my second

02:30:11.000 --> 02:30:13.000
podcast of the day. But other than

02:30:13.000 --> 02:30:15.000
ads for our own side projects. And you know

02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:17.000
someone has not been putting album art

02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:19.000
on Facebook. Because I like to see

02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:21.000
which ones get put up. Because they're

02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:23.000
funny. I've been putting them on Facebook.

02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:25.000
Oh I haven't upgraded the gallery. You're right.

02:30:25.000 --> 02:30:27.000
But if you go in and look at the posts they're there.

02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:29.000
But they're teeny.

02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:31.000
Then go to Hordehouse.com. Alright.

02:30:31.000 --> 02:30:33.000
Because they're teeny. Alright I'll get the big ones

02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:35.000
on Facebook. But anyway.

02:30:35.000 --> 02:30:37.000
What I really want to say is thank you guys very

02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:39.000
much for tuning in. Thank you for supporting our show.

02:30:39.000 --> 02:30:41.000
The OL Army which is what we call

02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:43.000
our fans make this all worth it. And

02:30:43.000 --> 02:30:45.000
keep us motivated to do this for years and years.

02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:47.000
If you like the show all

02:30:47.000 --> 02:30:49.000
we ask. Tell a friend. Tell

02:30:49.000 --> 02:30:51.000
somebody about the show. Word of mouth is all we

02:30:51.000 --> 02:30:53.000
got. We're not funded by a million dollar magazine.

02:30:53.000 --> 02:30:55.000
So please. Please help us spread the

02:30:55.000 --> 02:30:57.000
word. And again I'll just say the podcast

02:30:57.000 --> 02:30:59.000
awards. Great way to help spread the word. So

02:30:59.000 --> 02:31:01.000
please consider throwing us your vote over

02:31:01.000 --> 02:31:03.000
in that contest at podcastawards.com.

02:31:03.000 --> 02:31:05.000
And one more

02:31:05.000 --> 02:31:07.000
shout out to our buddies at The Geek Spin who are

02:31:07.000 --> 02:31:09.000
also nominated. And we hope that even

02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:11.000
if we can't win we hope they do.

02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:13.000
They're in best pod safe music.

02:31:13.000 --> 02:31:15.000
In a perfect world we both win. But you know

02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:17.000
we don't always get what we want.

02:31:17.000 --> 02:31:19.000
We don't always get what we want. Alright.

02:31:19.000 --> 02:31:21.000
Anyhow. Let's go

02:31:21.000 --> 02:31:23.000
around and get everybody's final thought.

02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:25.000
Loki. What's your final thought tonight?

02:31:25.000 --> 02:31:27.000
I am

02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:29.000
now telling my wife how to

02:31:29.000 --> 02:31:31.000
add a British

02:31:31.000 --> 02:31:33.000
English spell check

02:31:33.000 --> 02:31:35.000
to it. And I unfortunately had to add it

02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:37.000
to mine in order to figure out how to do it. So now I

02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:39.000
can talk in the Queen's English if I really wanted

02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:41.000
to. But

02:31:41.000 --> 02:31:43.000
I don't want to.

02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:45.000
Congratulations. You'll have to start

02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:47.000
tweeting in the Queen's English.

02:31:47.000 --> 02:31:49.000
Speaking of the Queen. Dark Soccer. Your final thought

02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:51.000
tonight.

02:31:51.000 --> 02:31:53.000
I am disillusioned with this country.

02:31:53.000 --> 02:31:55.000
My final

02:31:55.000 --> 02:31:57.000
thought tonight is Pretty Rainbow.

02:31:57.000 --> 02:31:59.000
Pretty Rainbow.

02:31:59.000 --> 02:32:01.000
Where? Your dresser's

02:32:01.000 --> 02:32:03.000
little drawers there. Oh yeah.

02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:05.000
Actually that is why I bought it. Alright.

02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:07.000
That's it. Thank you guys for tuning

02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:09.000
in and listening to us. We'll do it again

02:32:09.000 --> 02:32:11.000
next week. Dark Soccer is next week your week

02:32:11.000 --> 02:32:13.000
off or is that two weeks? No it's not the week after.

02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:15.000
Alright so we'll all be back here then

02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:17.000
next week. So until then

02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:19.000
have a wonderful night. Be safe.

02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:21.000
And please when you're gaming online

02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:43.000
don't be a dick. Good night.

02:32:51.000 --> 02:32:53.000
See you next week.
