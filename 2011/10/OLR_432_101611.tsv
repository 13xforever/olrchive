13908	25442	Tonight, October 16th, 2011, Street Fighter X Tekken gets a release date, has Sony PlayStation Network information been compromised again, and a date is set for the new Xbox Dashboard.
31618	38402	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.
38842	42985	It is episode number 432 for this October the 16th of 2011.
43805	47868	My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my awesome co-hosts.
48188	51330	First off, the one and the only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
51570	51790	Hi.
51990	52651	How are you, Ms.
52691	52991	Summers?
54573	81689	mildly caffeinated mildly caffeinated as opposed to extremely caffeinated yeah because I had to decaf coffee but there's some caffeine in it yes little bits it's decaffeinated but not uncaffeinated enough to bounce the headache say hello as well to Tech Master Loki hello who I notice has brought dinner of choice tonight an entire pizza what is this triple bacon quadruple bacon triple bacon with Red Bull what a very nerd powered dinner I love it yes
82071	99723	Alright, we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Blackwolf show at All Games Radio www.allgames.com Join us in our chat room if you are listening live chat.orangelaunchradio.com After all, we are the show where every gamer has a voice
102044	103866	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft
127321	128442	I would think so.
128662	129663	I would hope so, man.
129723	132245	If he's not going to have new bumpers because of that.
132405	133587	I hope he did get something out of that.
133807	135308	He better.
135628	137270	Can you record a bumper for my show?
137570	148279	What I liked, I will be 100% honest, I'm an honest radio host, I didn't hear the entire interview because we use Bobby's time to kind of get some set up and some stuff of our own done, but I heard about half of it.
148660	152984	And one of the questions that I liked was that he asked them if they'd heard the
153484	156086	I'm sure it's doable in Adobe Audition, not too difficultly.
156126	157727	Probably just Google, like, GLaDOS Adobe Audition.
157787	158167	I don't know.
158187	159508	Probably a way to do it.
159528	161029	Bobby, by the way, is in our chat.
161149	161649	He says two new bumpers.
183624	184005	Awesome!
185866	187488	Not one, but two.
190311	192613	Let's see, what else is going on in our worlds today?
193354	194114	I want to mention this.
195135	198559	Usually we have a little chatter here at the top of the show before we get into our gaming weeks.
198579	202502	I was specifically asked to mention this to you, Loki, tonight.
202743	203884	I've been waiting to tell you about this.
204484	233386	Miklatov gave me a call about two hours before we went live tonight and you know he works in gaming retail right and he sells video games and all that good stuff he wanted me to tell you about a game that came out today Skylanders Spyro Adventure I saw the ads for that on YouTube that apparently if you've been listening to the show for a few weeks you know Loki's a huge fan huge fan I love it quickly reiterate for us what is this game and why do you hate it
233985	238607	This game is basically everything that's wrong about Activision all lumped up into one game.
238687	261096	It's basically Activision taking Spyro, a franchise that was beloved years ago, turning it on its edge and basically making it this thing where instead of having download content for the game, you're going to have actual physical add-ons that you buy, as in little, I wouldn't even call them toys, they're figurines that interact with this thing they call a portal.
261156	262997	So you basically stick these little figurines...
263497	265860	on this little portal device and you get to play as those figures.
265940	271926	I'm playing this trailer here that I'm not exactly sure what I'm going to see here because I know very little about this game.
272827	275329	I guess this is something like... Yeah, it's one of the toys.
275609	276911	It's one of the toys.
276991	278332	I would not give that to a child.
278412	279653	It's like a big skull.
281395	282276	Ghost Roshan.
282376	285880	He's a scary-looking demon thing with a mace for a tail.
287352	288373	I would buy that part, Sean.
288513	289794	That's more like a Morningstar.
289854	292497	Okay, so basically, though, it's a character.
294699	295820	It's basically a character.
297141	298902	You get these characters that you can play as.
298942	302385	It comes with three, including Spyro, which Spyro, by the way, looks like he's...
303286	304687	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
329782	331903	And, might I add, they're all $8.
332164	343751	Can you imagine if DLC out there for your favorite game, and hell, even Marvel vs. Capcom 3, which had really expensive DLC, it was like $5 a character, I think.
345027	367015	8 dollars for each individual character or you can get like a three pack I think for maybe 20 bucks or something like that it's just it's ridiculous but they're aiming this at kids because they did really well with their stupid toy titles like Zuzu Pets and Squinkies and they have a whole bunch of them coming out this November but I hate it because one
368136	369717	It's difficult to sell.
371238	373220	Kind of on the back side, you don't really see any of this.
373600	378545	But the way they had us set up the items and buy it and stuff is retarded.
381307	386732	Honestly, this looks like another Tony Hawk ride or something like that.
386852	389975	It's a peripheral game that's just not going to work.
390175	390275	And...
390615	398158	On top of that, because they're really trying to attract everybody, it's $80 to buy it on any platform, including 3DS.
399179	398158	$80.
400319	404981	Well, Miklatov wanted me to tell you, it's selling like crazy.
405501	407222	Apparently, they are already sold out.
407822	409023	It just came out today, I think.
409403	414225	They're already sold out of it on every platform, but the Wii, most of the characters are already gone.
414705	416506	It's selling like crazy, apparently.
416526	416726	Yeah.
418206	419107	Well, fantastic.
419828	421249	And I know that was my reaction, too.
421269	422010	I was like, great.
422370	427715	That means it's going to end up maybe, maybe, still too early to tell, being the must-have toy this Christmas.
427875	439987	Oh, well, they're already in bed with Toys R Us, and they worked a deal with them where they get an exclusive three-character pack for that title being placed on their Hot 15 toy titles of the holiday.
440007	440267	So, yeah.
441628	442829	That list is trusting.
444169	444489	Whatever.
444509	445070	You know what?
445210	445490	Cool.
445530	448031	If it does well for them, awesome.
448051	452273	But I just... I'd ask, first off, how many did they bring in?
452333	460777	Because, you know, selling out, trust me, with the quantities that my customers are buying, selling out wouldn't be that many titles.
460937	461097	So...
461471	485800	Alright, I gotta go to our chatroom at chat.orangelongery.com After all, we are the show where every gamer has a voice And not every gamer necessarily agrees Going to our chatroom, ShadowNextGen says Skylanders Spyro Adventure is the first good Spyro game in a while I'm reviewing it right now and it's a lot of fun You can beat the new Spyro game with the three included characters You are not required to buy anything else And he also says Spyro is $70, not $80, $69.99
491718	492519	You're wrong, Loki.
492719	493480	You're very wrong.
493680	494381	Oh, I'm sorry.
496623	496963	All right.
497224	501067	And DarkTetsuya says, I'd be willing to bet that it sells a million copies.
502389	504611	Invoking an old OLR joke from yesteryear.
505211	505932	So there you go.
507193	507554	I don't know.
508174	512499	That little clip I looked at didn't look terrible, but I can see where...
512819	514199	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
541428	542069	Thanks for watching!
559163	560404	I just, I hate that.
560604	564645	So it sounds like a lot of your frustration with this game really has nothing to do with the game itself.
564665	565746	It looks terrible, okay?
565886	566986	They showed it to me.
567446	568307	They showed it to me.
568447	572508	I actually got to play a little bit of the Wii version, and I was just unimpressed.
572568	574189	I was just like, big fucking whoop.
574329	574669	Oh, good.
575129	576850	Why do I need this stupid portal thing?
576970	580731	Why couldn't this have easily been done in-game without any of these extra characters?
580911	581652	Oh, I know why, because...
582492	592156	Activision wants to get in the toy business because they think, hey, if we can convince stupid parents to buy these $8 pieces of crap for their kids, then we're in the money.
592296	594257	To be fair, it's a good idea.
595318	596738	I mean, isn't that every Christmas?
597098	599700	Trying to convince parents to buy an $8 piece of crap for their kids?
599720	600380	Yeah, pretty much.
602944	605326	You're a parent now, would you consider buying it?
605346	606147	No, I would not.
607047	608228	You already knew what I was going to ask.
608709	609829	I would not, and you know why?
609889	611110	Because it's not a fucking toy.
611791	612911	A toy does something.
612971	616634	A toy would be something that you could play with outside of the game.
617355	620437	If they were action figures or something like that, like a G.I.
620477	625100	Joe or Ninja Turtles or whatever, they actually moved, did something, then that's fine.
625220	628742	Then that's cool if they worked with the game and you could play with them outside of it.
628843	630264	I could see that worth $8, but they don't do that.
630964	631624	Do anything!
652958	659630	And yeah, I know, back in the days, there was the Green Plastic Army Men, and those were also stuck to a base, but you know what?
659650	660451	They weren't fucking $70 either.
660471	660812	Or $8, right?
665054	665354	All right.
665474	667316	Is he allowed to have Tron toys?
667536	668957	Because maybe I'll have to.
668997	670118	Well, he's probably too young right now.
670258	671138	He's young for anything.
671198	672179	Right now he just likes books.
672659	673360	He likes books.
674161	674741	He likes books.
675421	680565	We brought down out of the attic Teddy Ruxpin and Grubby.
681626	684108	And I actually popped in a tape last night.
684128	684288	Man.
684648	685409	It still works?
685569	686250	It still works.
686290	686710	Wow.
687331	688853	Oh, it's in great condition.
688973	689453	Holy moly.
689473	694218	I kept that in great condition, and we also have Grubby, and I just had to find a cable to run to.
695019	703348	It just needs an audio cable so they both talk, but he thought it was cool for a few minutes, and then he went and, I don't know, was trying to steal the iPod.
703408	706431	Well, a kid his age is supposed to have a short attention span.
706471	707012	That's what happens.
707412	713577	But yeah, I still, you know what, despite the fact that they sold well in Miklatov's store, I still hope it fails.
714338	714618	Why?
714919	722305	Because I hate Activision and their experiments to try to capitalize on... I mean, seriously, they're trying to run this franchise into the ground.
722325	727069	They've already tried with a few games already, and now it's just like whoring this thing out.
727389	728831	It's Spyro and Friends.
728931	731053	I mean, take Spyro out of it.
731713	733494	I mean, seriously, just take him out of it.
733514	735395	I mean, he's not a draw anymore to these games.
735656	742400	I do want to move on past this subject, but I gotta say this one other comment from ShadowNextGen in our chatroom at chat.orange.com because I gotta say this does sound pretty cool.
743240	747003	ShadowNextGen says, Skylanders Spyro's adventure is also cross-console.
747343	753487	Kids who have a 360 can bring the character to their friend's house and play on the Wii version with all the progress that they had on the 360 version.
753647	754768	I gotta admit, that sounds kind of cool.
756417	757578	Loki's giving me a blank stare.
758359	759140	He doesn't care.
759901	760382	I don't care.
760682	761243	I really don't.
762645	762985	All right.
763045	763305	Fine.
763746	764287	All right.
764387	769633	And Tiger Claw suggests put a tape of OLR recorded on it and watch Teddy Ruxpin talk like everyone.
770394	775901	I don't know if Daddy would necessarily want Josh hearing some of the rants he does on this program.
776321	779082	And also, I don't fucking have a tape recorder anymore.
779622	780582	So how would I do that?
781442	786883	I mean, seriously, I'd have to go to my sister's house and she has my old, like, stereo system.
786923	787944	I think it has a tape player.
787984	790524	I'm not sure if it works anymore because that's usually the first thing to break.
790804	796805	I actually, I had a huge old boombox when I moved this last time that had tape recorders in it and everything.
796825	798026	I fucking threw it away.
798046	799066	Like...
799546	807429	I saw a great picture on Facebook earlier in the week or maybe it was last week it had a little picture of a cassette tape and a pencil and it said if you don't know what these two items have in common then you're too young
829753	830394	I thought it was funny.
830994	832096	It was an old people joke.
832316	834439	All right, moving on.
834939	836181	Not so lighthearted news.
836201	837642	In fact, this is kind of sad.
837682	840826	And it sucks that I'm having to do a eulogy two weeks in a row.
841307	845031	But that's just unfortunately the tech world has lost a lot of great people in the past couple weeks.
845452	847174	And this week we lost Dennis Ritchie.
848194	852798	You may not recognize the name as readily as you might say Steve Jobs, who we were talking about last week.
853719	860003	But Dennis Ritchie obviously had a direct impact on pretty much everything in the video game world.
860404	860704	Why?
861264	865627	Well, if you didn't know, he only wrote the C programming language.
866928	874074	That's kind of important because every programming language out there is just about some type of derivative.
876055	899793	Derivative, thank you, I don't know why the words just gave me, of C So, you know, I even learned a little bit of C++ when I was in college I actually originally studied to be a computer programmer But it wasn't really free It worked out terribly, and I actually, this is the ironic thing I actually blame my teacher I had a horrible, horrible professor And I don't think I went to a very good university either Yeah
900453	903295	You know, and granted, there were some things going on in my personal life.
903335	904476	I can't scapegoat everything.
904596	905697	A lot of it is my fault, too.
906118	907439	But let's be real.
907479	908780	Computer science was just not for me.
909200	911222	Ironically, what do I end up doing now for a living?
911362	912122	Not this show.
912202	913183	That's not my day job.
913223	913563	Trust me.
914144	915505	But the job I had to pay the bills.
915585	916005	I'm a teacher.
917706	943038	in a corporate environment so I teach adults much like the professor did so it's just kind of ironic that that's where I ended up but anyway I don't want to get too far away from the topic at hand obviously we have to tip the hat to Dennis Ritchie who created C programming language also was a co-creator of the Unix operating system which is a huge deal he passed away this week at 70 years old causes undisclosed at this time so
945038	946439	I think we're ready to move on to our gaming week.
946459	949600	I think cause was sadness from hearing that Skylanders is coming out.
949760	950220	Stop it.
950581	951401	Stop it right now.
951461	951981	It's terrible.
952021	952461	Don't joke.
952521	952841	Alright.
953182	953682	Moving on.
953902	954802	DarkSakura.
956143	957163	How was your gaming week?
957563	958584	I played stuff other than WoW.
959372	961254	Oh my god, congratulations!
961334	963096	Everybody give DarkSakura a round of applause.
964297	968522	Well, when you came in, I was playing Castlevania Symphony of the Night because we finally got it working on the system.
968542	969143	You sure were.
970084	974609	And, of course, I was screaming because, damn it, it's not playing on the PlayStation.
974889	977352	And I walked in the house and I said, what is a man?
977392	979374	And I threw a glass on the ground and Dan got very angry.
979614	981596	Yeah, especially since it was our class.
981676	981876	Yes.
984077	986399	And I called him a miserable little pile of secrets.
986719	988040	He just said, bitch, clean that up.
989001	989621	Pretty much, yeah.
989982	994025	No, we also played Guardian Heroes today.
994385	995205	We got the demo.
995826	1000029	And then Dan proceeded to go, wait, I want to play Radiant Silvergun and decided to play Radiant Silvergun.
1000069	1002291	And the demo was like half a level.
1002591	1003431	It's not even worth it.
1005232	1006272	Play more Grand Theft Auto.
1006292	1006452	And, um...
1032256	1033917	I didn't play any Earth Defense Force this week.
1034377	1035858	More Dead Rising 2 off the record though.
1036058	1036979	Are you feeling okay?
1037999	1044643	No, I just didn't get around to playing more Earth Defense Force because I was playing Dead Rising off the record.
1046104	1046564	It's alright.
1046704	1052027	I know a lot of the complaints that other people have because I didn't really play through Dead Rising 2.
1053148	1055389	Playing through sandbox mode is kind of relaxing actually.
1056469	1060332	Although I still don't understand why zombies are easily killed by guns.
1061618	1062638	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1092543	1093584	That doesn't make any sense to me.
1094664	1097146	Out of all the games, I mean, completely unrealistic whatsoever.
1099787	1100287	I just don't get it.
1100507	1103409	Why are the crazies, you know, more armored than zombies?
1104329	1107531	I think, granted, the zombies are dead already, but... I mean, shit.
1108152	1109893	It should only take a couple of shotgun rounds.
1110073	1115756	And I understand you want to make it difficult because they're, like, boss characters or whatever, but... I don't know.
1115816	1117917	Just put more of them on the screen or something.
1119133	1119654	It's a fun game.
1120937	1122880	My character is currently dressed up like a cowboy now.
1124744	1127209	I'm still going through every single piece of clothing I find.
1127249	1127670	I pick it up.
1128542	1131903	Is this the game that has the Proto Man costume I was reading about this week too?
1131923	1132024	Yes.
1132264	1132904	That's awesome.
1134004	1135365	Even though Capcom hates Mega Man.
1136385	1137606	That's why it's Proto Man, not Mega Man.
1138746	1139647	Oh, touche.
1141127	1146530	Alright, well if that's it for your gaming week, my gaming week was a lot of games you would not be expecting me to play.
1147770	1156694	I played a demo, and you know, I hate basing my assumptions of games off the demo, but let's be real, it's what a lot of us are doing in this day and age of digital download.
1157534	1161575	And I downloaded the demo for a game I was interested in at first because I love this series.
1161815	1163856	Burnout Crash is the game I downloaded.
1164656	1166116	And I like Burnout an awful lot.
1166156	1167637	The whole series is really fun.
1168437	1173518	And the crash mode in, what was it, Burnout Takedown 3 or whatever?
1173979	1174699	That was fun.
1174759	1175439	It's awesome.
1175499	1178680	And when I heard they were making a whole game based around that mode, I was really excited.
1179080	1184802	And so I downloaded the demo, I played it, and it was like the most uninteresting game I think I've played in a very long time.
1184922	1186122	Like, I'm sorry to say, like...
1186642	1187663	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
1203918	1211063	And for those that haven't played Burnout or know what the crash mode is, basically it's all about creating these huge explosions.
1211623	1214265	And you can press a button to blow up your car, essentially.
1214866	1217587	And as you fill up a meter, you can blow up your car again and again.
1217607	1220329	You're causing these big chain reactions and pileups.
1220389	1226553	And I know that sounds really exciting, but in a 2D Xbox Live Arcade title, it was really boring.
1227794	1229235	I was so not interested in the game.
1229295	1230996	And I tried.
1231016	1233158	I played through the whole first little demo and everything.
1234279	1235740	I don't want to drop $15 on this.
1235780	1236080	Sorry.
1237261	1238062	Sorry, Burnout.
1238702	1240203	Not a fan of the Crash Arcade.
1240444	1240744	Sorry.
1241044	1247549	I would love to play a game that was like actual racing Crash mode, though, because that was a lot of fun in Burnout 3.
1248230	1251493	And I can see where maybe somebody thought on paper it was a good idea, but it's not.
1252333	1252594	Sorry.
1253414	1261318	Um, I also played NBA Jam on Fire Edition, which, um, you know what I miss about the original NBA Jam?
1261398	1263079	The fact that it only had three buttons.
1263499	1269322	And, I don't know, like, I tried to play this new NBA Jam, and I was just like, my characters were not doing anything I wanted them to do.
1269943	1274925	And, you know, granted, I, you do not associate me with sports games titles often.
1274985	1276486	I'm not really an expert on them.
1276826	1282249	But there are a few sports game titles I do enjoy, and most of them have to do from when I was younger, and you know, and so forth.
1282269	1282309	Um,
1282589	1283030	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1297911	1298531	Final Fantasy XIV
1328638	1339105	After the phone call last week, Miklatov pestered me and pestered me and finally I decided to buy the game on Amazon because I found it for like 25 bucks new because it's pretty easy to find right now.
1339905	1341706	And I got the game.
1342687	1344228	It took me a while to install.
1344448	1349912	That was the first thing that pissed me off about it because my DVD was borked or something where my drive wouldn't even read it.
1350252	1357337	I had to dump all the files to Alan's computer because his drive could read it, transfer it to my USB drive, then install it off the USB drive.
1357797	1358557	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1375504	1378906	The question I think that's on everybody's mind now is, is the game any better now?
1379426	1381347	And I would say the answer is yes, actually.
1381387	1382988	The game is a lot better now.
1383408	1386690	The combat mode makes a lot more sense.
1387971	1390953	The game itself, graphically, is really good looking.
1391873	1392894	Thanks for watching!
1409444	1420392	and I think they've tried to improve the tutorial a little bit because I sense that there's been some things added with that but there's still a lot of what the hell do I do now going on in that game.
1420512	1433782	It doesn't really quite handhold you the way that WoW does for the first few levels and I had to take a lot on myself to go research wikis and fan sites devoted to the game to figure out like how do I get better armor and
1435669	1454662	or where is the damn auction house you know like these are things that the game doesn't really help you with and I realize that a lot of people that are going to defend Final Fantasy XI and Final Fantasy XIV are going to say well that's just that's part of the game these games are not wow you're supposed to figure these things out that's the challenge and I'm here to tell you most people aren't going to fucking have the patience for that
1455582	1462947	Um, that's fine if, you know, the select elite smart few want to, you know, go ahead and be all into it or whatever.
1463047	1467810	But without a significant amount of people supporting the MMO, the MMO is not really going to last.
1468610	1474274	Um, I definitely notice there's a lot less people playing this game than there was Final Fantasy XI when I was playing it.
1474314	1475735	I noticed that right off the bat too.
1476175	1478897	The server seems a lot more empty than XI.
1480001	1481942	To the game's credit, again, it's gorgeous.
1482242	1483462	The battle system's interesting.
1484082	1488824	I really like how they've handled the mixture of jobs now.
1489824	1499088	If you level one class like a Conjurer and then you level another class like a Thermiturge, you can take the spells you've learned as a Thermiturge and apply it to when you're a Conjurer.
1499868	1505350	Everything is like your own custom class that you've built of spells and abilities mixed together from the other classes.
1505490	1506090	That's cool.
1506290	1507170	There are things I do like
1509511	1510071	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
1533783	1562159	the guild levs or the little questing thing that they put into it you really can do a lot with a very limited amount of time like I have noticed you can get in there do some levs and you know you've gained some experience and you feel like you've done something for the day and that's kind of nice like that's something Eleven never really had is that you had to sit around find a party okay maybe we'll gain some experience unless you were a white mage hopefully somebody does I mean you know even as white mage he's a white mage yeah sometimes you'd struggle a little bit
1562779	1580142	but the nice thing is there are things you can do by yourself and the things that they've done especially with the crafting the whole fact that crafting is its own job system with its own quests even I thought I was going to really hate that at first but I realize it gives you so much to do playing alone
1580743	1583405	that XI never really had, at least back in its heyday.
1583425	1587948	Keep in mind, my frame of reference for Final Fantasy XI is up until about Treasures of Argon.
1587988	1589989	I never played after the Wings of the Goddess.
1590249	1594052	Well, I played a little bit of that expansion, but never the Abyssia or any of this stuff.
1594072	1596734	Like, level syncing, I was already gone by the time that came out.
1596774	1599696	So keep in mind, my frame of reference is a few years dated in the game.
1600456	1606103	Um, now here's the other thing, and I know you guys are probably waiting for me to mention this, because there's been a lot of talk about this this week.
1606583	1614773	Final Fantasy XIV had a lot of major announcements to it this week, one of them being, of course, the day the game shows up in the mail for me, what's the big announcement?
1615073	1617215	We're gonna start charging monthly for this game.
1617235	1617275	Ha!
1620080	1620420	All right.
1621161	1623802	And then they were previewing a lot of what they plan to do in 2.0.
1624162	1626083	And granted, a lot of it sounds really cool.
1626323	1629084	It looks sexy as far as... The screenshots look great.
1629344	1633686	They're incorporating the old school Final Fantasy more into it, which I think is great.
1633826	1637268	I really like what they've got planned out for Final Fantasy 14 2.0.
1638308	1643571	It's going to be very interesting and almost something unprecedented in gaming where can this game be rescued?
1644291	1667091	and it's going to be really interesting to see if they're successful or not but the fact that they're going to start charging people when the game is admittedly halfway done is a little weird to me and I'm going to be honest right now at this moment in my point of mind if they were to start charging for this game tomorrow probably not going to pay for it I'll enjoy my 30 day trial period and then be done with it I got a lot going on in Warcraft and other MMOs that I play
1668291	1670652	And it's not even going to be done until what, 2013?
1671312	1674513	The end of 2012, I think, is when the big, big expansion is supposed to hit.
1674553	1675413	Okay, 2013.
1675473	1677113	But here's the other thing, too.
1677133	1680534	You have to remember Final Fantasy XI, it didn't come out in America at first.
1680554	1681454	It was only out in Japan.
1681474	1689636	And when it came out in America, we essentially got Final Fantasy XI 2.0 because we had Rise of the Ziller included with our release when it came out.
1689696	1691337	So it gave them time to work out the kinks.
1691937	1699342	But now that that didn't happen this time and everything was kind of released at once, it does make me feel like I'm still playing this big alpha or beta test of a game that's not done.
1699603	1700844	And now they want to charge me for it?
1701224	1707869	Like, I realize they're trying to recoup on some massive losses on this game, but... Not my problem.
1708669	1710330	I kind of think they're in for a rude awakening.
1711131	1711411	Like...
1713593	1720817	The amount of failure of this game is just... Epic?
1721237	1723879	It is epic fail in every sense of the term.
1724720	1728002	Now, I think it's going to be really neat if the game can salvage itself.
1728082	1736387	And I got to be honest, a lot of what I'm seeing online and a lot of this plan... And I like that now they're being open with their customer base.
1736827	1758831	now they're talking more now they're laying out a plan like I think they realize they've fucked up in a big big way I mean for the president of Square Enix to say this game tarnished the Final Fantasy brand one of the biggest and longest running franchises in gaming history that is like not something to just blink at that's huge especially a Japanese company to say that
1761966	1789298	so but I think if the game kind of keeps moving on this path I mean it's definitely gone in the right direction I listened real quick sorry I listened I went back and listened to how I first described my Final Fantasy 14 experience and I called it fucking garbage that was exactly how I reviewed this game when I played the beta it is no longer fucking garbage but it's not a amazing game that I want to pay money to play every month it's pretty good
1790236	1790596	It's alright.
1791057	1791637	It's on its way.
1791977	1792538	It's getting better.
1793038	1803625	But see, what's the point if, like, why would I start paying for this game when they're like, oh, it's not really gonna be done until next November or, you know, the end of next year.
1804205	1804866	Okay, well, fine.
1804946	1806847	I'm not gonna pay for it until the end of next year.
1806967	1807808	That's when I'll pick it up.
1808268	1810570	It's like, why even announce that and then start charging?
1810630	1813051	All you're gonna do is just get people to quit.
1813772	1815353	I mean, you may get a few people that are diehard.
1815393	1819976	They're just gonna, I'm gonna level up my characters while we're doing this and stuff, you know, while you're working on it.
1820456	1846386	but I think a lot of people that were just like oh well it's free right now I'm just not gonna pay for it but now that they're gonna start charging I'll just wait and play something else and then I'll come back to it you know in a year or so but at that time who the hell knows what like Blizzard's gonna have at that time or I mean fuck how many more MMOs are gonna come about by the time that they're ready to launch 2.0 it's not gonna matter and a really good one's going free to play
1846926	1851970	We've got Swarder on the horizon at the end of December.
1852390	1856453	We've got Guild Wars 2 next year that has a lot of people really riled up.
1856753	1858134	There will be a WoW expansion.
1858274	1861436	By that point, Blizzard will have announced their next MMO.
1863097	1863678	Yeah, you're right.
1863818	1865059	It's getting a little crowded in the MMO space.
1865099	1867500	I think what's going to end up happening is it's just going to go free-to-play.
1867600	1868081	It's got to.
1868141	1872664	I mean, that's the trend right now, and a lot of these suffering MMOs end up going that way.
1872924	1878090	But then again, they're Square Enix and they're fucking stubborn, so they may just let it rot and die.
1879933	1885720	I would love to read a behind-the-scenes book on Final Fantasy XIV.
1886401	1889084	For better or for worse, this is a game that will go down in history.
1889785	1890345	Absolutely.
1891026	1891487	Absolutely.
1891786	1893106	And we're watching it unfold right now
1917240	1924470	We won this award the very, very first year, which was 2005, and DarkSakura now has her Duffy hat sitting on the trophy.
1924610	1925050	Yes, I do.
1926292	1926853	I'll take a picture.
1926993	1929556	But yeah, we've got that, and we would...
1930537	1931919	and be honored to win it again.
1932119	1938705	But there are a lot of great shows in the finals, but the promotion that we could get for winning would be great.
1939145	1943689	And as you know, we don't have a lot of big dollars or ways to advertise our program.
1943709	1944630	Don't have any big dollars.
1944650	1946252	Yeah, actually we have no money whatsoever.
1946332	1949034	So we really rely on word of mouth as we say at the end of every show.
1949074	1949515	So please...
1950075	1950916	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1972159	1987548	but um yeah we would be honored to win again and it would be pretty cool I think we would be the only show to have won the award like what six years apart but you know it it's been an honor just to be nominated all right that being said we fucking want to win
1988488	2016603	and also on Facebook you can check out we've got a little banner art thing that you can put in your signature on whatever forums you happen to visit and stuff to help promote voting don't spam people but at the same time please people you know tell them we really do need every vote because every show and you probably have a couple of the podcasts that are finalists in your listening rotation as you should there's a lot of great shows that were nominated
2017664	2034587	and you're probably going to be hearing this to death throughout the next couple weeks but you know it's really promotion from winning it can't be beat so it'd be great alright let's move on and talk about the gaming news so Loki why don't you start us off
2035246	2044252	Of course, you know there's a new fall dashboard update coming to the Xbox 360 to kind of make it look a little bit like Windows 8 or the Windows Phone and that kind of stuff.
2044532	2046593	Personally, I think it looks stupid, but whatever.
2047794	2048635	I don't really have a say in it.
2048655	2052237	I've got to update on the 25th of November when this actually goes live.
2053318	2059081	Apparently, it's going to be using a modified version of Silverlight, if you care to know how it works.
2059802	2064505	Honestly, I don't really care myself, but it's supposed to do a lot of integration.
2064585	2069709	Obviously, they're going to have more Kinect support and the live TV stuff.
2069909	2078855	Also, you're going to be able to do the Bing searches and all sorts of stuff to find different content on there.
2079675	2107268	and I believe there is also a if you wanted to I decided to opt out of it this year a beta participation to test the dashboard early honestly wasn't a big fan of having to update twice a day every single day until the launch of the actual dashboard so I passed on that but that was available shortly and I believe the submission for the beta program has been closed already and
2108709	2113147	Yeah, and of course, for those keeping track, 25th also is Black Friday.
2117195	2119376	Oh my gosh, that's rolling out on Black Friday?
2119896	2120116	Yep.
2120276	2121657	That's a recipe for disaster.
2123277	2123557	Maybe.
2123597	2125218	That sucks for those employees.
2125318	2129099	Because you know Microsoft's got to be fully staffed for a day that something like that goes live.
2129920	2131260	They don't have to work on Black Friday.
2131340	2134321	Well, they will at least have their stomach full of turkey.
2134761	2138182	And they will be ready to take those.
2138202	2139743	Loki always looking at the bright side.
2139983	2140263	You know what?
2141024	2154860	you know what an awesome thing to do is on Black Friday go to a theme park because they're empty I don't know about Disneyland Disneyland's always kind of the exception to the rule but I will say like I went to Magic Mountain a couple years ago it was empty on Black Friday Black Friday and Super Bowl Sunday best days to do that stuff
2156246	2159810	Anyway, as far as the fall dashboard goes, are you excited for this?
2160330	2160690	No.
2160750	2160971	No?
2161411	2162412	No, I hate the way it looks.
2162672	2163233	You don't like it?
2163473	2164754	I dislike it.
2165115	2170260	Windows 8, you know what, when that comes out, I am fucking turning this shit off so it looks like back to Windows 7.
2173523	2188964	95 XP whatever you want to call it you know I don't like this crappy oh look at all these panes of information yeah you know panes of information are it's more advertising space that's all this fucking is and I don't care about the ads that are on there already so why would I want to see more of them
2189324	2190025	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2210422	2232968	I hope I can yell that at my connect and it'll understand me because like honestly part of the NXE and part of the frustrating stuff in that is that you sometimes like honestly can't find the one simple thing you're trying to change in your settings because they're like all over the place so hopefully this has that a little more streamlined but as far as like being like a streamlined entertainment box well shit that's where they're all going now anyway
2233308	2251373	and I think the next generation of consoles just you wait how streamlined those things are going to be with your other entertainment stuff I'm cool with the fact that they're going to have content on there and I would like to believe that it's going to be free but I don't like the fact that it's tied in with my cable provider because
2252353	2256817	I mean, granted, right now with Comcast, I have the most basic, basic, basic cable possible.
2256837	2259240	I don't think I even have on-demand or anything like that.
2259720	2266346	But I don't want to have to have Comcast cable in order to access... I mean, I would love to get rid of cable, period.
2266627	2267668	Keep the internet, of course.
2268448	2270851	And just have access to this stuff.
2270911	2273233	Maybe not necessarily the stuff that's on Comcast.
2273253	2275815	Because if I want to watch on-demand Comcast stuff...
2276716	2279783	I'll just go to Comcast and watch on demand.
2280084	2281828	There's a ton of different ways to do that.
2282149	2285377	I don't need to actually hook up my console to do the same thing I do on my TV.
2285697	2286700	It just doesn't make any sense.
2289082	2294504	I've actually really given thought to just cutting my cable loose because I just, I barely watch any TV.
2294524	2296905	Well, ours is linked to our internet, so.
2297005	2301347	Well, yeah, so is ours, but I mean, still, if we could even save 20 bucks a month shutting it off.
2301367	2305509	But that's the thing, though, is as we did that, we cut out phone and we also cut out cable.
2306269	2312231	Well, we were going to cut out cable and just keep the internet, but they had a plan that was $2 more for cable included.
2312251	2313972	So I was like, okay, fine, we'll do cable too.
2314392	2318053	It's a good thing, too, because my plan was, oh, I'm just going to get one of those antennas and hook it up.
2318233	2319693	Yeah, I bought one of those antennas last night.
2319833	2320673	They fucking suck.
2321054	2322474	They do not tune in shit.
2322754	2323734	So I got nothing.
2323754	2327215	And the only time I did get to tune in a channel, it was so messed up.
2327235	2330876	When you have cable internet, you kind of have to have at least basic cable, right?
2330916	2332756	Like, I don't think any of the companies will sell you.
2332816	2335137	No, you can get just the internet.
2335217	2335537	Really?
2335697	2340958	I always thought you had to have at least... It's more expensive, but... Like local channels plus CNN, bare minimum.
2341358	2349668	No, you don't have to, but like I said, there's a deal that they have right now, and you can get it for, I think, they gave it to us for about $2 more a month.
2350248	2352091	And I was like, you know what, I can do that.
2352491	2358177	And since Comcast doesn't have any contracts, it's like, well, fuck, at the end of the year, just cancel.
2358418	2361782	Or end of one year's time, we can just cancel.
2361822	2362002	Yeah.
2362222	2362462	Who cares?
2362482	2363843	Yeah, I think that's exactly what's happening.
2363864	2365045	I'm sure these companies know.
2365065	2369128	Well, all they're doing is just raising the prices of... You watch, they're going to start raising the prices of a lot of internet...
2382099	2390482	Alright, well let's move on to some other gaming related stories, and speaking of rising prices, these next little few stories have to do with the online pass.
2390682	2398065	Yes, that's right, what once was Project $10 is now becoming the standard, and if you don't believe me, look at what they're doing in some big releases coming out.
2398985	2404407	Catwoman in Batman Arkham City, obviously this is a huge release that's out, what, this week?
2404487	2405408	Is this week Arkham City?
2405688	2405988	Tuesday.
2406688	2407949	It's actually on my friend's birthday.
2408210	2408690	Big week.
2409110	2411693	Well, Arkham City is coming out and here's the deal.
2411733	2415276	If you want to play as Catwoman, you need to have an online pass.
2416077	2418839	One of them will come with the game, of course, and you buy it new.
2419220	2422002	That's the whole deal is that you always do get it included new.
2422362	2430750	But if you end up buying the game used, you will have to purchase the VIP pass for 800 Microsoft points or $9.99 on PlayStation Network.
2430790	2432812	So, you know, $10 or however you slice it there.
2433512	2438273	They are quick to say that playing as Catwoman is not required to complete the game.
2438813	2441514	But come on, we all want to see Catwoman in that outfit.
2441534	2442514	Not entirely true.
2443034	2444215	Well, there's more.
2444295	2445055	Hold on, hold on.
2445435	2451817	There is something else going on there too, and that is a deal with a company called the Evil Cheat.
2453317	2453858	Evil G Evil G Evil G
2472834	2484325	So in other words, Project $10 won't apply if you buy the game used at this one retailer who has their hand firmly on the balls of all gaming publishers around the world.
2484345	2492412	I bet you're going to see a lot more titles because they have the strength and buying power to say, listen, bitches, you're going to fucking give us codes for all these games.
2492913	2494134	And that's how they're going to get around it.
2496016	2496556	Who's that hurt?
2496736	2497317	Everybody else.
2498949	2519954	or gross or gross if you're like me who gives a fuck about Catwoman but here's the gross part about it it's already on the goddamn disc it's just locked away behind a code because they're assholes is what it is so you know what fuck them don't buy the game or don't either don't buy the game or just don't fucking play as Catwoman who gives a shit
2520225	2524527	TigerClaw in the chatroom points out there are Riddler trophies that you can only get with Catwoman.
2524567	2526208	Exactly, that was the part I was going to bring up.
2527228	2530970	Yeah, so if you want 100% complete, you gotta play as Catwoman.
2531470	2534571	No, but granted, if you buy the game new, you're not losing any of this.
2534991	2536012	You're not going to lose it.
2536152	2536732	It's that, but...
2537335	2540617	You know, this is just that trend.
2540677	2548680	And by the way, speaking of trend, Electronic Arts mentioned this week that Battlefield 3 will also have an online pass.
2548700	2551882	You know, Battlefield 3, kind of a big game coming out pretty soon.
2552522	2554023	Just a little title you might have heard of it.
2554323	2555324	Battlefield 3, right?
2555724	2557565	And this was all confirmed on Twitter.
2559246	2565352	A user tweeted a guy working for EA, do you need to buy a new Battlefield 3 to play on Xbox Live?
2565613	2569236	And the response was, you can purchase an online pass for a used copy.
2569677	2573140	So, I mean, as if it wasn't confirmed that this shit is now the norm.
2573341	2576544	And it's the first game that they've done that's not a sports game either.
2577214	2579235	Oh, I did not pick up on that.
2580396	2584097	And obviously going to be a huge, huge title no matter how you slice it.
2584117	2585158	Yeah, I'm not surprised.
2585278	2589860	And I think that mainly is just to stop piracy because it's going to be a big game that's going to be pirated.
2589960	2596724	And to be fair, for what it's worth, this is also going to be a big title because you're going to have tons of people who buy it new.
2597164	2599685	And this will all be transparent to them.
2599705	2600185	It won't matter.
2600205	2601206	They get the code with the game.
2602714	2607822	So it's only for those people that are waiting to save a few bucks by buying a used copy that won't really be saving any money at all.
2607842	2614613	Well, just wait a little longer and I'm sure by then GameStop will have the code for you for free, you know, because they've worked out some sort of deal.
2618686	2632724	ShadowNextGen in chat says buy a game new and support the industry if you do that the online passcodes are not an issue I'm sorry once again okay yeah I understand buying new and stuff it supports the industry and stuff and I hear people saying well if you buy used the developer doesn't get any money
2633405	2635709	Listen, you stupid idiots, okay?
2636029	2639014	The developer gets paid when they fucking press a goddamn disc.
2639234	2646345	It can sit on a goddamn warehouse shelf in EA, Activision, you name it, and the developer's still getting fucking paid for that shit.
2646666	2648429	So the fact that they're complaining that...
2649610	2651931	We didn't sell another new copy.
2652271	2655473	Now our servers are going to go down because we have less people paying for it.
2655713	2656293	No, listen.
2656673	2661096	There's exactly the same amount of people playing on those goddamn servers as new copies that were sold.
2661336	2665758	You can't magically create two copies out of one without some sort of piracy.
2666519	2670121	I think we all agree that piracy is a no-no.
2670461	2673102	Yeah, piracy is bad, but that is really the only thing.
2673303	2673763	I'm sorry.
2673963	2675384	Used games do not eat into that.
2675424	2675584	Yeah.
2677245	2678546	It's just so stupid.
2679787	2680587	I'm with you and I'm not.
2681508	2683790	Here's my whole thing, and again, it's the movie industry.
2683910	2686231	And I think what's good enough for the movie industry is good enough for gaming.
2686291	2689153	And the movie industry hasn't died because of used games.
2690194	2692976	And there's always going to be game rental services and things like this.
2693476	2697499	I think there's enough people that want these games new the day they come out.
2697879	2698419	I pre-ordered Skyrim
2715829	2726197	And now, through exclusive deals, in order to get the product into those machines, even though a lot of them are really terrible deals, they have to destroy all that product because they're afraid of the used sales eating into their new sales.
2726217	2728678	And the same thing actually happened with the original runs of Hummers.
2729259	2736964	It's just like... No, seriously, not the Hummers, but the Humvees through the military, the first run of them, you could convert them into Hummers for sale.
2737364	2737645	Wow.
2737705	2743689	But then they actually, when they decommissioned them, they had to destroy them so that they wouldn't be sold and compete.
2743929	2746431	The same thing goes with Warner Brothers, for example.
2746451	2750795	Warner Brothers, they just instilled a 60-day rental window on all titles.
2753216	2754137	That's for everybody.
2754157	2757720	You know, before they used to have it where it was just Redbox and stuff.
2757760	2758421	Now it's everybody.
2758441	2761203	And I heard something I think they may even do at some point.
2761223	2768188	It's going to be six months once this all... The rumor is it's going to be turned into six months once all these contracts are up.
2768689	2768829	So...
2769591	2772173	Yeah, they hate the used industry.
2772213	2775595	But they're the only ones, though, so far that are kind of going to the extreme.
2776095	2778217	But once again, though, I'm sorry.
2779618	2787423	Yeah, I understand that people buying used or whatever are going to be affecting the amount of new copies that a store brings in.
2787463	2791605	Because if you have like 60 used copies, you're not going to be bringing in a lot of new copies.
2791665	2793847	And so, yes, that would eat at your bottom line a little bit.
2794347	2823727	but the people that sell back those used copies take that money to buy new fucking games that you may be producing so the fact that you're just stopping people from buying new games there's only a finite amount of money these gamers are going to have and if you're taking away that avenue for them to sell it back used and trade in to get a new game that you might be making so that you can get your fucking commission check then people are going to buy less games overall so you're just hurting yourselves that's really all it's going to end up being
2824668	2834619	I guess at the end of the day, most of the games I buy, I buy new, so it really doesn't end up affecting me, but you kind of can't help but go, they're going to make a buck wherever they can.
2835540	2838944	But myself directly, is this going to change my game buying habits?
2839024	2839645	Probably not.
2840886	2850533	I will say that I kind of noticed that this year I really am cutting back, and maybe it's just the economy or what have you, I really am kind of cutting back on the games I plan on buying new.
2850974	2860280	I go back a couple years and I probably would have bought a lot of games over the holiday season, but this year I really can't think of a lot that I'm going to buy.
2860420	2861962	I'm not even sure I'm going to buy Dance Central 2.
2862922	2863663	Sains over the third.
2863683	2863783	Yeah.
2883820	2886941	See, that's one of those games where I might want to check it out used.
2887161	2890202	That will have a pass, I'm sure, but here's the best part about Saints Row III.
2890922	2891302	Fuck them.
2891442	2892482	They've got system link.
2892622	2894063	I don't need to go on your fucking internets.
2896023	2897063	I'll just play it local.
2897343	2898384	I don't need your internets.
2898924	2899644	All right, let's move on.
2899664	2900944	We've got lots more stories to tackle.
2900984	2901524	DarkSakura.
2902885	2904345	There's actually something on my microphone.
2904385	2905205	How about WiiStuff?
2908553	2910073	The new Wii Bundle.
2910313	2911094	Wii!
2911274	2915955	It's going to have new Super Mario Brothers, but it's going to lose something very important to a lot of people.
2916575	2917295	GameCube support.
2918016	2918696	No more GameCube.
2918976	2919316	Sorry.
2920636	2921636	We're pulling a PlayStation.
2921937	2926918	So this is like our version of what Europe got at the Gamescom or whatever, right?
2927438	2927859	Pretty much.
2929260	2933524	It is going to have though, actually the system itself is black.
2934444	2940510	It has a black Wiimote Plus and a Nunchuck and a Super Mario Galaxy soundtrack.
2941851	2943252	And it's going to be out on October 23rd for $150.
2943392	2944593	Isn't $150 what a Wii costs right now?
2946315	2946595	Yes it is.
2952077	2957000	and they say that the Mario Kart bundle is going to still be available along with the new one.
2957720	2958421	Is that true, Loki?
2959942	2961663	You're like half shaking, half nodding.
2961683	2962883	No, yes, it's true.
2962943	2965105	I think they're going to sell the old ones until they run out of stock.
2965125	2968447	Yeah, I'm not doubting what DarkSakura is saying, but I'm like, okay, really?
2968487	2969827	Is that really the long-term plan?
2969888	2970428	Is that really?
2971380	2986726	Dan and I, back in the day, went through the entire supply of PlayStations, DualShock systems, at KB Toys, by where I worked, so that we could find the one with the port in the back because our old one was dying.
2987486	2991988	People are that anal and will try to find the ones that's got what they want in it.
2992208	2994889	People still want a PlayStation 3 that'll play PS2 games.
2995129	2995849	I've got one.
2996249	2997430	I have one that'll play PS1.
2998795	2999696	They all play PS1.
2999836	3003718	I know, but mine will play PS1, PS2, it's the whole thing.
3005059	3010222	Which one of the games I didn't mention I played this week, I actually put in old school PS1 games on my PlayStation 3.
3011003	3015205	One of the random games I played this week was like the 30 Activision game collection.
3015766	3020048	Oh my god, like going back and playing it now, I'm like, god, this is some sloppy ass packaging.
3020088	3023410	And like, what are these like LSD influenced title menu graphics?
3023430	3024171	Like, I can't even...
3024656	3026297	You know what I've had the urge to go back and play?
3026417	3026617	What?
3026838	3027418	Jumping Flash.
3028719	3031060	Like, plug it in and go play it in the front room.
3031401	3031701	Awesome.
3032261	3033282	And give myself a seizure.
3033922	3037704	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3056471	3058212	Super Mario All-Stars Limited Run Game
3079517	3079978	GameCube Free Edition
3095481	3097782	The Horizontal, the vertically challenged we.
3097902	3098202	Yeah.
3098422	3098902	Essentially.
3100342	3101743	The we.
3103043	3104023	The not so we.
3104263	3105584	I just, I don't understand.
3107364	3109164	It's the PSP Go again.
3109224	3112705	It's like, hey, we got this new system that's coming out and it's got less features.
3112725	3113906	No, it's not that bad.
3113946	3115046	It's not that bad.
3115906	3120772	Again, I think most people that give a hoot about GameCube compatibility already got one.
3121352	3124155	But still, the math just doesn't make sense.
3124295	3130002	They're literally cutting it out for no reason than maybe they plan to sell the games on the Wii U.
3131403	3134845	Which I'm sure is the... That's really the long-term thing we're looking at.
3134945	3136086	That's why they're cutting it now.
3136106	3138508	Because they know on the Wii U they want to sell the GameCube games.
3138568	3138948	Just wait.
3139308	3139648	Just wait.
3139869	3140589	Oh, it's going to happen.
3141209	3147233	But... Still though, I mean, if you're looking for... You could probably just get the Mario Kart thing.
3147574	3154498	And hell, I'm sure you could probably... If you really didn't want Mario Kart, you could probably trade it in someplace and get New Super Mario Bros.
3154538	3156800	I mean, I'm sure a lot of stores have it.
3156940	3157040	It's...
3157760	3160022	A popular game, and I'm sure a lot of people have traded it in.
3160503	3164426	But just... I don't understand.
3165127	3167329	You might need the GameCube controller for something else later on.
3168450	3170171	Here's a crazy random question.
3170271	3174835	Do you think these new Wii's are being done to combat a lot of the modding that people are doing to their Wii's?
3175296	3175676	I think so.
3175816	3180760	Because I think a lot of that modding stuff runs off of files that were part of the GameCube.
3182042	3183363	Like the dull files or whatever.
3183383	3183543	Yeah.
3184163	3188766	Now I'm understanding why they just are slowly taking that out.
3188786	3193069	Like if that's part of it, that makes a lot more sense now why they've removed it.
3193610	3202315	It's akin to PlayStation 3 deleting the other OS support but without all the hubbub because, you know, this is a physical thing.
3202415	3206418	Nintendo can't come to my house and take the GameCube compatibility out of my existing Wii, you know?
3206878	3224066	yeah or they couldn't but that wouldn't be good for them yeah not a good idea that would require that would require uh releasing like an online patch which the Wii is very limited in what they're able to do yeah all right anyhow let's move on with some more news Loki
3224976	3233124	So they're going to have some new, as you may remember, the Halo HD remake, the Halo Combat Evolved Anniversary Edition.
3233264	3238028	They're going to be doing some sort of like, I'm sorry, I'm reading the wrong story.
3238428	3238989	Stupid me.
3239009	3240811	I was like, what the hell are you doing, Loki?
3241671	3244254	Let's talk a little bit about the PlayStation Network.
3245094	3250139	The OLR host compatibility has been removed out of Loki in the most recent upgrade, apparently.
3250339	3251100	Yes, exactly.
3252601	3266273	The PlayStation Network hasn't really been compromised, but some of the data or whatever that was grabbed from the PlayStation Network the last time has been used to try to compromise the PlayStation Network again, I guess.
3266633	3281797	So basically a lot of user accounts, I want to say it was like 75,000 or something like that, were locked out because people have been attempting to sign in using login and password information that were obtained from
3282878	3286961	One or more compromised lists from other companies' sites or sources.
3297590	3306155	and I'm wondering if maybe that has something to do with also the Xbox Live users which we're still getting a lot more of those now finally being reported.
3307836	3314780	Much like Sky had a problem with people breaking into his account and spending money on FIFA shit.
3316101	3318262	There's been a lot more people talking about it.
3318682	3321904	Thank you Gaming Press for covering this a month after it was news.
3322384	3339692	Yes, Ars Technica actually started reporting a lot of people actually telling them that say, hey, you know, my game account was hacked and people were, they bought, you know, FIFA 11 and also like the gold pass or whatever, spent $100 on my account.
3341133	3361759	and there's been a lot of other things people are starting to see FIFA 12 and purchases are kind of related to that and of course you know sure enough all of my Microsoft points that were stored on my Xbox Live account had been spent on in-game items for FIFA 11 I don't own that game hell I don't even like soccer games
3362359	3364921	and whoever spent my Microsoft points had tried to purchase more.
3365001	3370525	Presumably, when the purchase failed, they abandoned my account and went to steal from some other unsuspecting gamer.
3371206	3372607	And yeah, I think that's kind of the case.
3372687	3374728	So, of course, you know, change passwords.
3376329	3377110	Hopefully, that's enough.
3377830	3381313	And, of course, Microsoft went, you know, went pressed for a statement.
3382173	3387355	We do not have any evidence that the Xbox Live service has been compromised.
3387835	3394777	We take the security of our service seriously and work on an ongoing basis to improve it against any evolving threats.
3395077	3401319	However, a limited number of members have contacted us regarding unauthorized access to their accounts by outside individuals.
3401379	3405821	We are working with our impacted members directly to resolve any unauthorized charges.
3406742	3424000	to their accounts as always we highly recommend our members follow the Xbox Live account security guidance provided at xbox.com security what a lovely sanitized response from the Xbox Media Relations Department what a lovely sanitized response because some could mean a million
3424878	3425639	I mean, I get it.
3426080	3429484	Microsoft does not want to panic on their hands like what Sony had to go through.
3429584	3437154	But, you know, they're trying to poo-poo this and make it sound like it's not that many people when I've known at least, at least 12 people that this has happened to.
3437174	3441299	And you just read the comments and like... Do you know how many people I've known that have had their PlayStation accounts hacked?
3442293	3442773	Zero.
3443573	3446054	And I mean hacked for, like, money or false charges.
3446614	3455897	And, you know, on this story, there's 109 comments, and a lot of them are saying, yeah, hey, are there any... Let's see here.
3457498	3457678	Um...
3461164	3462265	My account was hacked yesterday.
3462285	3464569	I'm getting the standard 25-day lockout treatment.
3464609	3467675	I'm also disputing the charges on my credit card.
3470720	3472283	On July 10th, the same thing happened to me.
3476403	3477324	Let's see here.
3477364	3480046	A couple people I know have had this happen.
3481166	3484309	So there's a lot of people that are saying, hey, this has happened to me and stuff.
3484349	3486891	And that's why they even kind of made a comment on the story.
3486931	3492334	Hey, there's been a lot of people that have been writing us saying, hey, the same thing has happened to me.
3492675	3494176	So yeah, it's a little bit of a pattern there.
3494716	3495136	A little bit.
3495437	3497058	Got to figure it out because...
3498447	3499548	And why is it FIFA players?
3499928	3502629	And why is it 30 days that your account gets locked?
3502669	3504450	Remember, guys, I didn't play my Xbox for a month.
3506011	3511214	And I made some purchases on PlayStation 3 instead during that time of things I might have bought on the Xbox 360 instead.
3512915	3515837	I think their whole process needs to be fixed.
3515897	3517058	That's another big problem.
3517418	3520320	Microsoft does some very shady online things that they do.
3521040	3522941	There's the whole credit card removal thing too.
3523982	3524282	Anyhow.
3525903	3527383	I refuse to give them my new card.
3527583	3530705	I will not give them my new card info because my last one just expired.
3530765	3531905	They will not get my new one.
3531925	3534306	They'll still try to charge it though.
3535167	3536307	They will still try to charge it.
3536547	3538308	Good luck.
3538468	3542150	They will lock out your account until you give them a new card.
3543270	3546531	I will close my Xbox account if it comes to that.
3546551	3547952	I'm going on record saying that.
3548352	3550153	They are not getting my new credit card number.
3550453	3579021	if they were able to I will turn in my seven year whatever it is Xbox Live membership I'm done if that's the case let it be known there's a lot of stuff I see where people will change their credit card and then they'll because they'll try to renew and then it doesn't auto renew and so they give them a new card to charge it and then they'll charge another year on there and they get two years instead of one see that shit's shady like there's a lot of shady shit going on right now
3580222	3581543	in all this Xbox Live stuff.
3581563	3582665	And I think we need some answers.
3583085	3587171	And stop with this corporate speak.
3587291	3588673	You should be able to get out of that stuff.
3588693	3591316	This is why people are fucking mad at corporations right now, by the way.
3591616	3596603	Not to go on a tangent that I really don't want to go on on this program, but this shit is why people are mad.
3596903	3598025	This is why people are mad.
3598485	3599005	Thanks for watching!
3616877	3621359	Alright, moving on to a story that you didn't hear anything about just 10 minutes ago on this program.
3621820	3626182	Some changes are coming to Halo Anniversary, talking about the Kinect functionality.
3626222	3628523	Some of the details came out this week at New York Comic Con.
3629223	3639889	There's going to be the feature to analyze enemies, meaning that you can actually talk to your Kinect and go into the library or something like that and look at, I don't know, your enemies, I guess.
3640849	3641269	Outro Music
3659955	3660496	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3680333	3681254	Who gives a fuck?
3681814	3689819	And also, you know, before this, the only other thing that they said that you could use to connect for was switching between Classic and HD mode.
3690739	3691800	I wanna play Classic!
3692200	3693081	I wanna play HD!
3693621	3695202	Why would I need to do that on the fly?
3695902	3696603	Who cares?
3698226	3714255	that's not a full price game so alright that's that's again Halo Anniversary Edition like in another year probably would have bought the game new but this year just not not enough into it to really want to buy it sorry maybe I'll rent it
3715436	3717537	How about something that makes me particularly giddy?
3717557	3719297	A release date for Street Fighter X Tekken.
3739548	3739788	Ooh.
3740488	3744631	It's going to be on PS3 and Xbox 360 on March 9th.
3745612	3747913	And they revealed that at New York Comic Con.
3748994	3750255	So that's pretty cool information.
3750855	3755518	As far as other stuff that's going to be... It was actually just confirmed for the US.
3755538	3759281	It's the Build-It-Yourself Arcade Cabinet Bank.
3760322	3761803	A prequel comic by Udon.
3762983	3779354	36 pre-order packs and a bunch of other stuff 9 exclusive gems only available for pre-ordering and 45 gems when you pre-order a bunch of stuff so yeah
3781698	3782799	It will be out in March.
3813001	3813722	Yes, he does.
3814342	3815043	All three of them.
3816685	3817005	That's it.

3822911	3825934	Today, Skylanders Spyro's Adventure came out.
3826855	3830819	PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, 3DS, and PC.

3834342	3835664	Thrilled that the game's coming out.

3948450	3951633	Holy crap, why is there so many damn rugby games coming out?
3951813	3955096	And this one also, again, exclusive to GameStop for some reason.
3955596	3959239	Jonah Lomo Rugby Challenge.
3959820	3963843	I mean, seriously, is that like the third or fourth rugby game that's coming out on Xbox 360?
3963923	3966265	Wasn't one of them exclusive to Evil G2?
3966405	3967726	Yeah, the last one from 505 was.
3967746	3968927	Don't get me wrong, rugby's cool.
3969007	3970028	It's cool, but it's not that cool.
3975032	3977853	I think there's more games than there are football games or basketball games.
3977873	3982135	Let's see, Pokemon Rumble Blast on the 3DS.
3983255	3984896	The Haunted, The Hell's Reach.
3985196	3987237	Wait, what do you do in Pokemon Rumble Blast?
3987317	3995440	Is that just... I think it's like the Pokemon... Wasn't there a Pokemon Rumble or Arena game or something like that in the Nintendo 64 GameCube?
3995820	3999922	I think it's just like a fighting game, sort of, with Pokemon characters.
4001812	4002172	I don't know.
4002312	4003233	I don't play Pokemon.
4004714	4005274	It doesn't matter.
4007015	4007516	Just curious.
4008216	4010197	It's the only 3DS Pokemon game that's coming out.
4010337	4013299	Yeah, but there can be a lot of Pokemon.
4013339	4017122	It's like saying Mario Tennis is the only Mario game available this holiday.
4018448	4039054	and that's it, that's everything alright, let me travel to Japan and talk about some of the stuff that's coming out in Japan this week starting off on the Xbox 360 Dead Island gets a Japanese release this week as well as Deus Ex Human Revolution FIFA 12 World Class Soccer Hacking Extreme NBA 2K12 all out on Xbox 360 in Japan this week
4044596	4045917	Moving on to the PlayStation 3.
4046657	4049759	I imagine you'll see a lot of that same stuff just on the PlayStation 3.
4050479	4054341	Yep, Dead Island, Deus Ex, FIFA 12, NBA 2K12.
4054381	4055282	There are a couple others, though.
4055342	4057003	Ratchet and Clank, all 4-1.
4057643	4064047	And Gekke Juban Macross F, Sayonara no Tsubasa, Hybrid Pack.
4064887	4066248	That is coming out this week.
4066288	4067348	I guess this... What is this?
4067428	4070730	Is this like a... Oh, it's the movie and the game.
4070790	4071691	That's why it's a hybrid pack.
4071711	4074232	Yeah, it's the movie and probably a PlayStation Network game.
4074672	4075493	Yeah, it's like a Blu-ray.
4075593	4076373	Oh, because it's a Blu-ray.
4076573	4079275	So it comes with the Blu-ray and it comes with the game that goes with it.
4079415	4080415	So it's like an all-in-one pack.
4081516	4083697	That is out on PlayStation 3 this week.
4084478	4086819	Going to some other systems...
4089665	4095191	On the Sony PSP, we have FIFA 12 is there as well.
4095731	4102718	And Naruto Shippuden, Naruto Impact, because you know it's just not a week without a Naruto game coming out in some form or another.
4103579	4106943	Also a brand new type of memory stick, I guess a 4GB one.
4107003	4108404	Is this with branding on it?
4108885	4111968	Yeah, this has some branding for Uminiko no Naku Koro.
4114887	4118409	Lastly, trying to go to the 3DS real quick and see if we have anything over there.
4120090	4122291	Note the 3DS in Misty Pink is this week.
4122331	4124993	Remember the DS for girls is this week.
4125573	4130196	And the Japanese version of Tetris on the 3DS is out this week.
4132097	4132477	That's it.
4133618	4135159	How about the UK, DarkSakura?
4135837	4163127	on the 19th we have Beat Hazard Ultra and Dungeon Defenders Ratchet and Clank all for one on PS3 Worms Crazy Golf The Sims 3 Pets so looking forward to that that was actually on the 20th my bad on the 21st we have Adventures of Tintin The Secret of the Unicorn and Captain America Super Soldier on 3DS FIFA Manager 12 Football Manager 2012 which of course is real football and not the crap that they call football over here
4164047	4180212	Jacket Alliance Back in Action, Jonah Lomu Rugby Challenge, Naruto Shippuden 3D, The New Era on 3DS, and Naruto Shippuden Ultimate Ninja Impact, Tetris Axis, Naruto for everyone, Tropico 4, and Batman Arkham City.
4181273	4181553	That's it.
4181973	4182673	Busy week over there.
4183427	4184348	DarkSakura.com
4202869	4209955	and basically Microsoft's a very big company and you've got Twisted Pixel, a relatively small developer.
4210376	4221104	We're very interested that they get to stay who they are and they get to retain the magic that they have as a small indie and also we'd like to leave the golden goose alone so to speak.
4221505	4228070	So basically they're going to be able to do kind of what they want but still have some financial backing to go with that.
4228110	4231413	Maybe some better projects because they'll have a little bit more to work with.
4232773	4244925	so that's kind of cool because they're definitely a unique developer I mean it's not too surprising I kind of already thought they were in bed with Microsoft because hasn't all their shit been exclusive anyway?
4244945	4246046	um
4247845	4271057	I don't know about that I think they had some stuff that was on PC but yeah I think for the most part it's been exclusive to Microsoft probably the Microsoft well PC still counts if it's for Windows yeah that's true so they can still develop for that I'm wondering if they're about to be trusted with some big Microsoft franchise to make a game for that
4271997	4273718	or, I don't know, maybe Microsoft just wants a piece of it.
4273738	4275860	They just don't have a lot of big franchises anymore, though.
4275880	4283024	I mean, if you think about it, it's just Halo and Forza and Fable, I guess.
4283625	4285086	They're not touching Fable, I know that.
4286867	4287127	Who knows?
4287167	4288448	There could be something new in the works.
4288468	4290929	If they can make anything better than Fable 3, that'd be great.
4290949	4291910	A new cameo game.
4292250	4295431	It could be something new for the new system, too.
4296212	4298793	There's got to be stuff under development for the new Xbox.
4298813	4301974	We've heard a lot of rumblings about that, whatever it may be.
4302094	4310678	So maybe because these guys did Explosion Man and all that, they're tasked with making some must-have game on the new system.
4310958	4311278	Who knows?
4312098	4312839	Just throwing it out there.
4312859	4316580	There's always new franchises that can come up with something unique and brand new.
4316720	4317441	It's a sequel.
4317901	4318401	Absolutely.
4319679	4321260	Alright, let's see.
4321621	4328566	One more story for you guys for this half of the show, and that is about Ubisoft delaying a game called Rocksmith.
4329327	4330508	You familiar with Rocksmith?
4331208	4332489	That's alright, a lot of people aren't.
4332849	4344559	Rocksmith is the game that has the real guitar with it, which I kind of thought Rock Band 3 was supposed to kind of cover that, but I guess Rocksmith is supposed to be more like you actually see the frets on the screen.
4344599	4345699	It's a lot different.
4345779	4346760	It's a lot easier to learn.
4346800	4348702	I think this is the game my friend was working on.
4349182	4349522	Oh, really?
4349702	4349902	Yeah.
4350122	4350963	Well, it's been delayed.
4351783	4354124	And now it's going to be launched in 2012 in Europe.
4354564	4359525	And I guess this is because of some complaint that was against Ubisoft.
4360126	4362266	Yeah, filed by a band named Rocksmith.
4362586	4363427	Oh, how funny.
4364547	4368348	So I guess now there's a whole ugly thing that's got to be settled around that.
4369269	4372150	Court documents say that the dispute could go through February 2012.
4372930	4375711	So until that's resolved, this game is delayed.
4376511	4379954	Unless you happen to buy a PS3 version, which is region free.
4382356	4382937	Oh, okay.
4382997	4384378	I mean, if you're really in a hurry.
4384738	4385999	Is the game not coming out here in America?
4386280	4387120	Yeah, it comes out next week.
4387321	4387681	Oh, okay.
4388542	4391644	It's just, you know, we don't have a band named Rocksmith over here.
4391784	4392545	They're over in Europe.
4392825	4393266	There you go.
4394507	4394787	All right.
4395167	4400012	Well, let's stop talking about these newfangled games and let's go back to the classics.
4400352	4400532	Let's go.
4401827	4403869	DarkSakura, what's a classic game of the week?
4418143	4446458	Castle of Illusion starring Mickey Mouse because we talked about it last week and I started thinking about it so it's this in Japan it was known as Castle of Illusion I Love Mickey Mouse Great Wonderland Castle Adventure really long name huh and it came out in 1990 and it was on the Mega Drive slash Genesis developed by Sega of Japan and it was one of the parts of the games that were released right before Sonic the Hedgehog came out
4447818	4449380	And I love this game, so shut up.
4450401	4452723	It's a side-scrolling game, and you play as Mickey Mouse.
4453223	4459228	And he has to save Minnie from this evil witch named Miserabelle, who wants to steal Minnie's youth.
4459628	4461810	Because Minnie apparently is young and pretty.
4462891	4466915	Who I believe was not actually a Disney villain otherwise, though, right?
4467415	4468096	I don't think so.
4468396	4472259	It's interesting that they didn't use a quote-unquote real villain.
4472299	4472640	But anyway...
4474389	4474809	You know what?
4474949	4477892	No villain is as awesome as Maleficent, the damn diva.
4478692	4479453	So, moving forward.
4481214	4486838	You play in the castle and you have to defeat different enemies and bosses by jumping on them, which makes you jump higher.
4487219	4489440	And you get apples and marbles to use as projectiles.
4490141	4493724	And you get health boosts and extra lives or bonus points.
4493984	4496005	And then after you beat the boss, you're given a gem.
4496406	4500749	When you get all of the gems, you build a rainbow bridge that lets Mickey walk into the castle.
4501269	4501630	DarkSakura.com
4519373	4522454	It also did come out on the Master System, but they redid it.
4522894	4533017	And so the Game Gear version is actually exactly like the Master System version because it's one of the ones that ran in Game Gear, one of the Game Gear games that ran in Master System compatibility mode.
4533978	4536798	So, I mean, there's not really a whole lot to say about it.
4536899	4537899	It's a cute game.
4538019	4539559	It's got some good challenge to it.
4540180	4540720	It's fun.
4544184	4545705	I mean, Rob, you're looking at it, right?
4545745	4546725	Yeah, it's a fun little platformer.
4546745	4561493	You know, I didn't own a Genesis when I was younger, but I do remember I remember there was kind of a stink because this came out around maybe a year or two after the NES had Mickey Mousecapade which was kind of their big game and Capcom had the Disney license for Nintendo, though.
4561593	4563654	They weren't really putting stuff out on Genesis at the time.
4564014	4568096	In fact, wasn't Capcom's first Genesis game the Street Fighter Championship Edition?
4568536	4569117	I think it was.
4570037	4570417	I think so.
4570457	4572238	I seem to remember that from my gaming history.
4572679	4573139	So, um...
4573579	4575683	Street Fighter 2 came out before Championship Edition.
4576536	4578197	Well, no, but remember the Genesis one?
4578357	4580338	The Genesis got the Championship Edition.
4580378	4581579	It was like a big freaking deal.
4581879	4585061	But then the Super Nintendo got Turbo Championship Edition, so it kind of went back and forth.
4585582	4589084	But anyway, my point is that I do remember this game.
4589104	4591485	I never played it when I was younger because I didn't own a Genesis.
4591886	4599911	But I remember wanting to because I thought, gosh, this game looks a lot better than Mickey Mouse Capade, which actually was a pretty sweet NES game.
4600551	4603773	I don't know if you've done that as a classic Game of the Week before, but if you haven't, it should be someday.
4604013	4612457	Well, this one, actually, I don't know if I've ever told you about the week I traded my SNES for my friend's Genesis and Master System converter.
4613538	4614658	This was one of the games I borrowed.
4615218	4615579	Oh, nice.
4615979	4618940	And I had a field day with this game.
4619040	4620061	I loved it so much.
4620541	4621942	I mean, there's so much more to do.
4622022	4627824	I mean, not just, you had the, you know, the jumping boosts and you had swinging from vines.
4627964	4631166	Just graphically, this game was really pretty to look at.
4631186	4634027	You have to remember again, guys, this was a long time ago this game came out.
4634347	4638449	But some of these environments, like this level that we're swatching Mickey in here on the YouTube right now.
4638849	4639510	Thanks for watching!
4659842	4662484	Well, um, there was a sequel.
4663084	4665706	Sorry, I was just going to say, weird that it's never shown up on any collection.
4665746	4668628	I mean, I understand probably the Disney licensing probably has a lot to do with that.
4668929	4670630	Well, now they've licensed, though.
4671390	4673051	Disney took the license for Castle of Illusion.
4673612	4674252	Oh, that's right.
4674272	4675553	We covered it last week.
4675573	4676134	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4676154	4676574	Okay, okay.
4677475	4678495	And we don't know what they're doing with it.
4678555	4678996	Right, right.
4679856	4681057	Probably just sitting on it for a while.
4681078	4684360	I hope there's maybe a newer version of this coming out.
4684380	4684941	That would be awesome.
4685161	4687543	Well, let me go a little bit further then.
4687603	4687943	Sure, sure.
4688223	4692567	Okay, well, first of all, there was a sequel named Land of Illusion that came out of the Master System into Game Gear.
4693208	4700153	And then Castle of Illusion was re-released in 1998 in Japan as the Sega Ages Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck on Saturn.
4701134	4703216	And that also included Quackshot.
4704645	4706266	There's a very interesting game on its own too.
4707567	4708848	So there you go.
4709288	4710929	It did have a re-release in Japan.
4712570	4712910	All right.
4713931	4714511	Very cool.
4714952	4719375	There it is, your classic game of the week, Castle of Illusion starring Mickey Mouse for the Sega Genesis.
4720135	4720555	Nice pick.
4721076	4721356	Thank you.
4722048	4724651	Alright, that's going to do it for part A of our big show tonight.
4724691	4725171	But don't go anywhere.
4725211	4725752	We're not done.
4726032	4727434	We still got half a show to go.
4727714	4730177	We got a lot of news coming out in the next half of the show.
4730657	4735242	And I'm going to get to your emails as well at mailbag at orangelaundry.com and Twitter topics.
4735722	4737764	And hopefully, I'm hoping some people will call us.
4738305	4738565	Frenando Yes
4755905	4758806	So, you haven't seen that fan art?
4759046	4761767	I'm going to go to YYR's Twitter.
4762647	4766048	It's like YYR underscore, or maybe the other way around, underscore YYR.
4766068	4766568	It's one of the two.
4767028	4768909	And he has the artwork in one of his previous tweets.
4768969	4769389	It's awesome.
4769969	4776231	So anyhow, we'll talk with you guys in the Skype line as well as plenty more news when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4776271	4776711	Don't go anywhere.
4783487	4786311	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.
4786371	4791098	We are live on this Sunday evening, October the 16th of 2011.
4791778	4792379	I'm out of breath.
4792419	4793441	That was such a fast break.
4794763	4797747	Where we're of course taping another episode of our show, episode number 432 to be exact.
4800490	4801010	DarkSakura.com
4817077	4817337	I do.
4817677	4818478	I'm going to have to draw.
4818938	4821760	My favorite is the ferret with the tongue hanging out of his mouth.
4822360	4822920	Dead ferret.
4823440	4824541	I feel like drawing the ferret.
4824561	4830304	The question is, when's Ranma going to cosplay that?
4830664	4831805	It's just a matter of time.
4831865	4833005	It's just a matter of time.
4833446	4833886	All right, look.
4833906	4837928	You're going to have to bulk up for it, though, because Fernando looks pretty ripped, so I'm just saying.
4838528	4840629	I don't think it's going to be that hard for Ranchan.
4840669	4841350	He was a Marine.
4843075	4844016	Thanks for watching!
4858593	4859874	Speaking of marathons, I gotta mention this.
4859934	4861436	I can't believe I didn't show roll this somewhere else.
4861636	4862277	I need to mention this.
4862317	4863097	Need to, need to, need to.
4863578	4866681	Extra Life happened this past weekend and congratulations.
4867041	4867982	They broke a million dollars.
4868282	4869503	That is outstanding.
4869603	4870104	Yay!
4870124	4872887	And I know we had some members of the OL Army that participated in Extra Life.
4873727	4876530	The moment you announced that, Shermie started licking her bed in excitement.
4876910	4877631	Thanks for watching!
4899065	4907491	The date for the new Umlaut I think was announced previously, but just to reiterate, it's December 8th this year, and it's going to be flipping huge.
4907851	4910233	Like, I can't say too much.
4910814	4916798	I may or may not know some things, but it is on Thursday, December 8th, and it's going to be awesome.
4917979	4918279	Awesome.
4919240	4930981	so if you are like anywhere remotely near the San Francisco Bay Area you need to make plans to attend if you are nowhere near the San Francisco Bay Area you still should keep the day open just saying moving on
4932432	4934214	Let's go through some quick, quick news.
4934274	4934514	Loki.
4935134	4940838	This is quite appropriate, and I'm actually kind of psyched to play it because this is more of a puzzle game than it is a crashing game.
4941219	4949725	But Burnout Crash is going to be coming to the iOS, both on iPad and iPod or iPhone or whatever.
4950845	4951666	So you can check that out.
4952346	4958731	I think that's actually a pretty good fit for it because, yeah, like you said, it's more of a puzzle game and kind of disappointing.
4959448	4960890	Thank you for watching!
4976312	4977453	And it's an online MMO.
4977833	4986239	I guess originally, you know, I guess the game was supposed to be inspired by Counter-Strike, but now it kind of... I don't know, it's more top-down.
4986259	4990842	It looks to me like one of the old Fallout games or something like that.
4992303	4996146	They're calling it kind of Baldur's Gate with Jagged Alliance, but...
4997427	5004332	I think it's awesome because honestly the last Shadowrun game that came out on the 360 was terrible, so this is more like it.
5004892	5007194	And it's free to play, so cool.
5007714	5010596	And it's being made by Sixth World, I guess.
5013197	5017380	I don't know if they're... No, Sixth World was the last one, I'm sorry.
5017480	5020042	Cliffhanger is the one that's putting this together now.
5021841	5022981	Oh god, that's going to be awesome.
5023361	5024742	No word yet on what's coming out.
5025182	5026542	Shadowrun definitely has its fans.
5027742	5030723	There's been some hit and miss games in the Shadowrun universe, so this sounds neat.
5030863	5031923	It looks cool.
5032003	5035644	It could be a franchise, if done well, it would be successful.
5037024	5040365	And then, last but not least, of course, PopCap.
5040585	5044046	They're always putting out gamer crack, if you will.
5044446	5048330	They have a new game coming out called Popcorn Dragon.
5049131	5054516	And in Popcorn Dragon, you shoot fireballs to make popcorn that a dragon then attempts to eat.
5055177	5059080	They're saying it's kind of like a popcorn fruit ninja with a cute mythical beast.
5059140	5060802	That sounds so PopCap.
5060922	5064125	Like, when you describe it, I'm like, God, that just sounds like a PopCap game.
5064385	5064566	To me...
5065546	5069089	To be fair, I don't think we've really heard of anything that that studio's done for a while.
5069109	5071531	I mean, their last big, big game was Plants vs. Zombies.
5071551	5072351	That was some time ago.
5073152	5075073	Well, they have to port it to every single platform.
5075093	5075793	They had Bejeweled 3.
5076134	5077395	Oh, yeah, shit.
5077415	5078255	I forgot about Bejeweled 3.
5078295	5079476	You're right, you're right, you're right.
5079656	5082098	And then, you know, it wasn't technically PopCap.
5082118	5083559	The spinoff studio, yeah.
5083579	5088782	But they had that, which I really wish they'd do more stuff because, you know, Unpleasant Horse is fucking amazing.
5090283	5092425	But, yeah, they had a few things.
5092990	5101160	this looks alright, it looks like it could be cool and I do like popcorn and dragons so it'd be worth checking out
5103860	5105601	That's the quote they're going to put on the box.
5106542	5110345	Loki from Orange Lounge Radio, I do love popcorn and dragons.
5110965	5117130	It just made me think about having a little pet dragon and watching a movie and going, damn it, I want to pop this popcorn.
5118971	5121033	Who doesn't love popcorn and dragons?
5121133	5122014	Terrorists, that's who.
5122034	5122474	You know what?
5122594	5123395	I don't like popcorn.
5123915	5124195	Really?
5124295	5127678	Because the corn kernels get stuck up under my gums and it hurts.
5128499	5129359	Without fail.
5129519	5131141	I guess that's a fair, but you like dragons.
5131781	5132001	Yes.
5132262	5132502	Okay.
5132962	5134664	Because dragons will smite my enemies for me.
5134684	5136105	So you're not completely evil.
5137126	5138367	I guess I can see that in that part.
5138447	5141770	I do get annoyed with popcorn kernels too, but I'll say, what is it, my weakness?
5141810	5148095	And people at work who can't cook popcorn with a dam and end up making the whole building smell like burp popcorn.
5148115	5149677	There's always, I love burnt popcorn.
5149697	5150517	There's always the burnt.
5150538	5152239	I purposefully burn my popcorn.
5152479	5152860	Just a hair.
5153120	5154481	See, you are the office apple, sir.
5154501	5155502	No, no, no, no, no.
5155522	5156683	No, no, at my old, at my job.
5156703	5157684	It's just a tear, you know.
5158084	5160346	My desk was like two rows from the break room.
5160767	5163269	So it would smell like this burnt shit all the time.
5163630	5164951	Whereas I was perfect.
5167053	5168995	And I had our crappy microwaves.
5169276	5170096	You were perfect?
5171278	5172459	As for popping popcorn at work.
5172799	5180988	I had our crappy microwaves timed that I could always do the perfect container of popcorn with only a couple of kernels left at the bottom and nothing burnt.
5181428	5201654	you have to understand that I follow the directions completely but I know when to pull it out so that it has you know when to pull out yes I know when to pull the popcorn out of the microwave oh you you adolescent you know how to pull it out when the explosion's just right
5203123	5208986	Hey, I don't want to singe anything in there, so... I have to make sure... With that dragon of yours.
5209587	5215830	Because if you leave it in too long, it's just going to be waffle smoke all over the building.
5216871	5218472	You just have to know when to take it out.
5218512	5220233	And then it stinks all day.
5220673	5221173	Exactly.
5221934	5225416	This is the clip I want them to play at the podcast awards.
5225876	5228838	Thanks for watching!
5242566	5244947	You know, it doesn't smell too bad.
5245288	5249790	Okay, as gross as the story is and as non-video gaming related as the story is, I have to tell it.
5249910	5251591	I'm like kind of the opposite of you, Loki.
5251631	5254252	Like, burnt popcorn, nah, not really a fan.
5254532	5258554	But what I'm a total fan of and can't get enough of are like the barely popped kernels.
5259055	5264617	Like the kernels that have popped a little bit, but are like not all the way popped.
5264797	5267419	Like, I will pull a microwave, I'll pull out early.
5267439	5267519	Okay.
5269136	5276104	Just to get a bag full of those because those are the delicious kernels, in my opinion, are the ones that are barely popped.
5276144	5278006	Of course, they're also the worst for your teeth, but whatever.
5281509	5284613	Moving on to non-dragon related things.
5284713	5289217	Only us can take a PopCap game and turn it into...
5291929	5292469	Pulling out.
5293890	5295111	All right, moving on.
5295711	5297673	Do you hear these sounds in the background?
5298353	5302656	This is the sounds of BurgerTime on Xbox Live Arcade.
5303796	5305677	That's right, BurgerTime, Xbox Live Arcade.
5305697	5306378	It has a release.
5306498	5309320	It is November 2nd is when this is coming out.
5309440	5311921	And look, it's kind of an old OLR in-joke.
5312061	5316464	It hasn't come up a lot lately, but I really defend the old arcade classic.
5316504	5318505	BurgerTime is vastly underrated.
5318585	5319226	It's a great game.
5320126	5332050	I actually, contrary to popular belief, I don't really believe it's the best arcade game ever made, but it's a fun one, and it's underrated, and I have to admit, this looks pretty cool, what they're doing with it, with the whole round platforms and the graphical upgrades.
5332410	5335791	Hopefully it retains some of that charm of the original, and I'm really excited to try multiplayer.
5336331	5342113	So I will get to do all that on November 2nd, because that's what the release date is, according to Monkeypaw Games, who's making it.
5343573	5346835	Infinity Blade, of course, very popular game on the iOS platform.
5346935	5347735	I have yet to play it.
5348475	5349596	I don't know why I've been dodging it.
5349616	5349976	It's all right.
5350316	5351277	But very popular.
5352157	5354278	It is actually going to be coming to arcades.
5355058	5356399	That struck me as very interesting.
5356439	5366163	But Infinity Blade FX is making its way to, I guess, Dave and Buster's and other types of facilities like that.
5366244	5367084	So it's kind of cool.
5367104	5367164	Yep.
5367304	5367544	DarkSakura
5391064	5391705	Okay, let's do it.
5392866	5393786	We'll make that sacrifice.
5394267	5398050	By October 28th, so we'll have to go just after that to make sure that the game is there.
5398330	5401172	And then I can finally play Infinity Blade, be it in arcade form.
5402073	5405896	One other story before I turn it over to DarkSakura, and that has to do with Leisure Suit Larry.
5406237	5407678	Okay, look, before they ruined it,
5407978	5411400	Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards is being remade.
5411440	5412681	That is the original game in the series.
5412701	5417244	They're remaking it with an HD upgrade for the series' 25th anniversary, which is coming up at the end of 2012.
5434574	5435094	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5453590	5482272	it should be noted the games that came out within the past five years he had nothing to do with and in fact he was kind of a bitter Betty about him and I can't say I blame him in fact listen to this quote to EGM that he said quote I'm overjoyed to see Larry released from his digital dungeon after all this time and be placed in the hands of someone who understands him and wants to see him brought back to the forefront by people who love him and understand him that's that's what we call subtly throwing shade
5483280	5484422	That's also a little redundant.
5485042	5499501	A little bit, but... Well, you may remember that Legion Suit Larry before was released by Vividi Universal, who put out wonderful franchise-killing games like the Spyro series, the Crash series, and of course, the Legion Suit Larry series.
5501089	5501709	Thank you.
5501789	5503529	And guess who bought Vividi Universal?
5504230	5504790	Activision.
5505910	5507270	See where we're going here?
5507430	5509850	Well, they must have not optioned to continue this series.
5509890	5511871	And after the last couple games, I can't imagine why.
5512191	5513431	So now Replay Games picked it up.
5513831	5521152	What's cool about this, Replay has said that if they're successful, they're going to keep doing these HD updates through all the original games.
5521352	5522833	So that's kind of rad.
5523153	5524693	They're also planning on some new games.
5525033	5527573	So let's just hope it doesn't suck.
5529694	5530494	Moving on, DarkSakra.
5531750	5535332	Well, how about some stuff about the Nintendo DS?
5535692	5536652	No, I don't want to hear it.
5537933	5538293	Okay.
5538693	5546897	There has been over 50 million units sold in the US, and this was numbers presented by Nintendo.
5547677	5553419	That's seven years post-launch, still selling, and like I said, 50 million units.
5553439	5557461	I wonder if that includes three DSs, because technically it's kind of part of the DS family.
5557481	5558582	It says, and it's variants.
5558742	5559262	Okay, there you go.
5561043	5567088	Also, for Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3, there is going to be a playable Galactus mode.
5568229	5569209	That's pretty cool.
5569950	5574213	You can just have him smack people with his bitch slap and his flick attack, I guess.
5574834	5576115	You know who else I saw in there, by the way?
5576835	5577356	Phoenix Wright.
5577656	5578917	Yeah, I heard about that too.
5578977	5579737	Phoenix Wright's in it.
5580458	5581078	Pretty cool.
5582900	5585101	Is it bad that I thought he was in the original one?
5585222	5586943	I did not play the original one.
5586963	5588044	They put in Frank West.
5589008	5590488	Frank West, Star Wars, The Old Republic
5609674	5610615	Oh, Rob Oh, Rob
5629352	5633835	Alright, so let's get back into some more long-form news.
5634256	5639319	Of course, coming up later in the show, the mailbag at mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com is where you can always send us emails.
5639900	5642582	And the FUs of the week coming up as well as Twitter topics.
5642622	5649887	Make sure you get those in because we will read Twitters while we're waiting for calls at twitter.com slash OLR.
5649987	5650928	So get those all in right now.
5651048	5651208	Loki.
5652274	5666423	Unfortunately, you know, when you're a game studio that produces all the Harry Potter games for the movies and then the movie series ends, what's left for you than to just, you know, go under?
5667243	5669685	I actually have an answer to that, but I'll let you finish the story.
5669805	5670045	Yes.
5671666	5680352	Apparently, Bright Light Studios is now under the formal consultation process and
5681372	5690577	and basically the employees that are impacted will be considered for other positions at other EA studios including those in the UK.
5691058	5697842	The UK is a vital center of game development for EA and we intend to maintain a strong presence there.
5698602	5702964	And of course, you know, the last few games that they put out kind of...
5704693	5713407	But, you know, movie tie-in games don't have a high bar to hit, but even then they miss those, so maybe it's for the best.
5714588	5714968	Harry Potter MMO
5737864	5739284	I would not want them doing that.
5739304	5741725	Well, yeah, and maybe this is for the best.
5741905	5746508	It sounds like based on the games that they've made, and I've played some of these games, they're not that great.
5748549	5754391	They should put it in more capable hands if they're going to do a Harry Potter MMO, but seriously, I'm not even that into the Harry Potter universe.
5754551	5759234	I still haven't seen a single movie past the third movie, and I really haven't read the books.
5760154	5764496	I would try this game in a heartbeat because that universe would just be fun.
5764916	5766237	It's meant for a video game.
5766717	5771018	Another game that they created that also was terrible, Create.
5771779	5772479	What the hell is that?
5772579	5775380	It was supposed to be a thing that was going to take on LittleBigPlanet.
5775400	5776200	It came out last year.
5776580	5777461	No one gave a shit.
5777481	5778541	Was that the Xbox thing?
5778681	5780762	It was Xbox, PlayStation 3, and Wii.
5780782	5782242	It was terrible.
5782562	5783863	What was Microsoft's answer to that?
5783923	5784743	Didn't they have something?
5784883	5786063	Oh, that was also terrible.
5786123	5788084	That ended up being an indie game thing, didn't it?
5789085	5792107	I would really like to see an MMO come out of the Harry Potter universe, but it does need to be done right.
5792127	5793469	Don't do a shitty MMO or people are going to be upset.
5815157	5815417	All right.
5816158	5817119	Anything else before I move on?
5817279	5819381	Yeah, but it's a tangent, so I'm not going to go there right now.
5819481	5819722	All right.
5819762	5820082	Why not?
5820142	5821504	I'm going to start another story, so go ahead.
5821544	5822144	Go for the tangent.
5822485	5829351	I forgot to mention, since it wasn't really my gaming week, and one of the reasons why I didn't play a lot of games this week, because I was reading Ready Player One.
5829712	5830773	It's fucking amazing.
5831053	5833174	Oh yeah, that was the book you were talking about last week, right?
5833535	5834055	I'm serious.
5834215	5836216	Any of our listeners for this show, this book is for you.
5836396	5839278	I mean, it's absolutely, without a doubt, for you.
5839418	5840259	Can I get it on Kindle?
5840879	5841079	Yes.
5841520	5843021	Maybe I'll check it out.
5843041	5847664	Dude, I mean, not to spoil stuff, but like... Be careful.
5848672	5850993	I'm going to spoil one thing, but it's kind of cool.
5851113	5862376	The very first challenge that this guy has to go through to get this, because you have to find three keys and unlock three gates to find an Easter egg that basically gets you the assets of this company.
5862497	5864717	This guy is like a multi-billion dollar thing.
5864737	5867598	So it's a little bit like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory with the treasure hunt and stuff like that.
5869059	5869919	He has to fight a lich.
5872583	5873844	Is it the Lich King?
5873884	5878571	He has to joust the Lich in the dungeon.
5878952	5880494	It's some dungeon from Dungeons & Dragons.
5880514	5881656	Is it the Lich from Shadowgate?
5882277	5883598	Not the Lich from Shadowgate.
5883919	5884780	But he has to fight him.
5885241	5886663	He has to joust him.
5888320	5889701	on the old arcade game Joust.
5889901	5892102	I knew something was coming with that.
5892302	5895483	It's just... Seriously, it's a fucking amazing book.
5895523	5897244	You said this has been optioned for a movie, right?
5897364	5898504	It has been optioned for a movie.
5898584	5899005	Warner Bros.
5899025	5900005	bought the rights last year.
5900625	5901166	I'm serious.
5901546	5903587	Go check this book out now.
5903707	5904487	It's great.
5904747	5904887	What?
5905007	5905167	What?
5933701	5934803	Scott Pilgrim vs. The World
5952226	5952786	But I'm serious.
5954227	5955688	I don't read books a lot.
5955828	5957089	I mean, hardly ever.
5957789	5959310	And I couldn't put the book down.
5959370	5961672	I had to read the whole thing straight through until I finished it.
5961932	5975180	And it's seriously, if you're a fan of the 80s stuff, if you're a fan of classic video games, if you're a fan of just cool, like kind of where's the internet going to go, that type of thing, you've got to read this.
5975240	5975921	It's just amazing.
5976801	5978142	So that's my tangent there.
5978504	5978784	All right.
5979505	5980726	Moving on to some other news.
5981306	5982107	Oh, let me put it this way.
5982447	5982988	No, you're done.
5983068	5984109	No, no, this is cool.
5984870	5987432	The writer of this, he did a movie, Fanboys.
5987792	5989574	He wrote the script and everything for that.
5989634	5990414	Oh, God, I've heard about it.
5990434	5992476	Okay, I haven't seen that movie, but I know what it is.
5992576	5994518	The guy, he drives around.
5995838	6001821	And one of the cars, the avatar in this game, or this universe, drives around.
6001881	6003402	It's not like a blue avatar.
6003502	6006344	No, it's this avatar in a virtual world type thing.
6007244	6010846	He drives around, or flies around, I should say, and DeLorean...
6011286	6014609	Night Rider, Night Rider, Night Rider, Night Rider
6036966	6040388	Actdeft wants to know the name of the book Ready Player One The London Philharmonic Orchestra
6064085	6066546	Super Mario, Angry Birds, Metal Gear Solid, Sons of Liberty, Fallout 3
6082015	6082335	Awesome.
6082795	6084516	There's a sample available online.
6084656	6093760	It's Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 theme, and they actually have a clip of it available on SoundCloud that you can check out under username kwall.
6094060	6099102	Let me play a quick little clip here of this, if I can kind of skip ahead in the song here a little bit.
6104485	6109507	I can't change the volume on this, but usually these classical songs are a little quieter anyway.
6111300	6112520	You kind of get the feeling, right?
6112560	6114101	Here we go.
6120443	6122624	That's the London Philharmonic Orchestra doing that.
6122644	6123404	So that's going to be awesome.
6125745	6127565	Available wherever, like, you buy CDs.
6127665	6129446	You know, Amazon, iTunes, what have you.
6130106	6130326	All right.
6130726	6131807	Let's go to the mailbag.
6131887	6135428	Every week you guys send us emails at mailbag at orange lounge radio dot com.
6137066	6139327	DarkSakura is going to read some of her favorites right now.
6139367	6140787	Mailbag at Orange Lounge Radio.
6140987	6141667	All two of them.
6142228	6142728	Two?
6142988	6143248	Yep.
6144008	6145468	I'm firing the listeners.
6146649	6147729	First one comes from Ian.
6148329	6151590	Hey guys, long time listener, first time, I don't know, emailer, whatever.
6152050	6157512	I'm not sure if you guys knew about this or not, but over the DSI Wear store, you can...
6159073	6161214	I guess you can get the word get was left out.
6161354	6164176	Legend of Zelda Four Swords Anniversary Edition for free.
6164657	6165137	Hells yes.
6165597	6167659	I'm not sure when it runs out, but you better act fast.
6167999	6169200	Actually, I have an answer for that.
6170120	6171021	I was aware of that.
6171081	6173583	It's pretty big news in the DS world if you're a 3DS owner.
6174165	6199049	and absolutely, it's free you literally have no reason not to get it I haven't done it yet unless you don't have the 3DS February is when it will not be free anymore so it won't be free forever I don't have a 3DS the good news is, those of you that get them at the holidays which I imagine a lot of people are going to find 3DS's under their Hanukkah tree or whatever it is you'll be able to still get it through February
6201058	6201518	Next email?
6201999	6202339	Why not?
6203499	6204400	Hello, peoples.
6205480	6207622	And this comes from Redertainment.
6208042	6210763	There's a story that broke this week that just seemed to stick out in my mind.
6210843	6212024	Why men are in trouble.
6212564	6213685	Okay, I'm going to click this.
6214425	6215506	Men are always in trouble.
6216246	6217567	They won't man up.
6219349	6219649	DarkSakura.com
6237677	6242700	I tend not to pay attention to what you are currently saying or what you have said or will say in the future.
6242801	6253088	So when William Bennett, President Obama, or my mom tells me to get off the video games five hours a week, get yourself together, get a challenging job, or get married, I tend to put that in the bottom of my to-do list.
6253288	6254309	Stay black, Red Entertainment.
6254349	6256971	This message was crafted while watching a news podcast on my Apple TV.
6257411	6259513	That's just called having a rebellious nature.
6260494	6262295	You don't want to do what someone tells you to do.
6262615	6264356	Someone says do it, you want to do something else.
6264577	6266438	That's actually very common.
6266698	6269401	A lot of people kind of have that rebellious nature, right?
6270462	6274986	Well, I'm just kind of glancing this over and... Is this an opinion piece?
6275026	6275607	I noticed it's on CNN.
6275627	6277549	Yeah, I think it's an opinion piece.
6278050	6278530	By a dude.
6278930	6279231	It is.
6279371	6281153	It's by a guy here.
6282194	6282454	Don't care.
6284420	6284961	Thanks for your email.
6285021	6286702	I was trying to read over your shoulder.
6286782	6288804	Oh, you can get in the email and read it yourself.
6288824	6289825	I'll read it and be more educated.
6289865	6292128	Do I look like your correspondent?
6292168	6293289	Now who's nagging?
6294090	6295151	I'm not nagging.
6296252	6299295	It's written by a guy who's literally from the Middle Ages.
6299755	6300556	Oh, you read it?
6300796	6302198	Yeah, he's super different.
6302238	6304220	Thank God someone's educated on this program.
6304680	6308701	He's so fucking old and he just, like, he complains about all this stuff.
6308841	6310161	Back in my day!
6310901	6313882	No, I actually put a comment on my Facebook when I linked the article.
6313942	6318223	I'm like, yeah, this article's missing a lot of back in my day and get off my lawn.
6318243	6320983	I mean, because seriously, that is what this is complaining about.
6321303	6322064	They need a man up.
6322224	6326444	Those people need to go into the military and fight for their country and blah, blah, blah.
6326484	6331485	That's what the problem with people is they sit at home and play their Xbox instead of getting a job.
6332046	6333446	It's like, oh, my God.
6333526	6334166	I mean, seriously...
6334426	6335847	Okay, well, how about this?
6336187	6337228	Okay, I'm going to put it this way.
6337248	6338469	Let's use a military angle.
6339109	6344492	Now, would you go to work for a place that you knew was in debt and charging more debt?
6346934	6348015	This is going to get political.
6348035	6349335	I already know where you're going with this.
6349355	6350216	But I'm just saying, would you?
6351017	6353118	If they offered a great retirement plan, I might.
6354539	6355179	Touché.
6355199	6356260	Their debt is not out.
6356640	6362064	However, if the company was in debt and started laying off people before you could retire...
6363184	6383598	I would, I think logically any profession you go into you would think about the longevity of your job, absolutely So then why would it be a good idea then to go into the military when the entire, the last couple of wars have been waged on a visa He's one of the people that's wrong with the problem, he's probably one of the 1% too
6385353	6392295	I don't want to say anything negative about people that choose to go into the military because it's a thankless job that not everybody's brave enough to do.
6392315	6393355	No, that wasn't my point.
6393435	6394916	I'm saying in response to this guy.
6395396	6395656	Okay.
6395796	6399957	What makes it attractive... Now, I understand going in for patriarchy.
6399997	6400557	That's one thing.
6401118	6403638	Or going in because it's a good option right now.
6404078	6409380	It's kind of a good... To be fair, it's a really good substitute for school.
6410327	6437793	I know that sounds like really fucked up but it's like that real world experience because people do a lot in the military I even considered going into the reserves for the Air Force but the whole thing is that he's bringing this up but what he's not looking at is that is there really going to be a future for more people involved if they can't afford to pay the people involved if we're charging up more debt I think that this guy is one of the old school who's part of the problem
6439277	6441238	You make it sound like, though, that we're paying back the debt.
6442598	6446959	I mean, we can borrow as much money as we want.
6446979	6447599	That's the problem.
6448120	6450960	They're not paying for the debt because we're not having a raise in taxes.
6452121	6452921	We're not rationing.
6452941	6454941	We're not doing any of the stuff that they've done in past wars.
6455682	6457562	This world's going to hell in a handbasket.
6457922	6464004	I bet you anything would have more jobs if we were actually working to fund the stuff ourselves and not outsourcing everything.
6464437	6466319	Well, that's a whole nother Oprah.
6466339	6469422	I wasn't literally saying though that he was telling people to go into the military.
6469462	6474106	I was just saying that he's, you know, of the mind of like old, old, old people.
6474146	6475267	I know that mindset though.
6475847	6476888	Just like very stubborn.
6476928	6478209	He thinks, oh, it's a new thing.
6478289	6479991	Therefore, it's the cause of all problems.
6480051	6487037	If it wasn't the comic books, the rock music, the drugs and more rock music, I mean, or maybe rap music.
6487057	6487458	Yeah.
6488699	6488839	Yeah.
6490265	6509860	Wasn't it, and I'm going to horribly misappropriate this quote and hopefully not disrespect somebody who recently deceased, but wasn't it even Steve Jobs who said something about like drugs was one of something that really like the one time he did it was kind of like a life changing thing, not necessarily in like a negative way, but that it was something that
6511790	6513071	I should have opened this box.
6513591	6517794	I tell you what, we would be missing several classic... Not that I'm condoning drugs.
6517914	6518014	No.
6518054	6520536	I'm not condoning drugs, but I'm just saying, you know.
6520756	6525659	But keep in mind, think of how many classic masterpieces would be missing if not for Absinthe.
6526209	6531713	Sometimes people who are a little rebellious cause us to think a little bit differently.
6531893	6533114	I guess that's really my point.
6534315	6534996	That's exactly it.
6535036	6535996	Think different, right?
6536377	6536737	Touche.
6536957	6539679	Except that's bad grammar and I can't quote that.
6540019	6540400	Shush.
6540480	6540780	All right.
6541440	6541901	Moving on.
6543104	6543985	That's it for the mailbag, huh?
6544426	6544726	That's it.
6544807	6545367	I said just two.
6545608	6549353	I guess this will be a... Well, I wasn't listening because all I was hearing was nagging.
6551056	6551336	Rob!
6551857	6552037	Rob!
6552538	6552738	Rob!
6553179	6555522	What a good opportunity to go to the F-U's of the week.
6555542	6555622	What?
6575760	6597334	I think that my FU of the week is going to be something a little bit less, I don't know, it's the whole job thing, you know, it's kind of getting on me and the whole marketing is really coming back to, it's really, and I told you guys before the show, but it's really playing a personal role in my life and
6598920	6616139	It's ridiculous, and I really want to give a big F you to people who try to argue against something that they don't believe in by using fallacious arguments, like number one.
6616620	6618162	But using fallatio is okay.
6618262	6618762	That's fine.
6619983	6620783	But you know what I mean.
6621104	6627246	Like, trying to discredit the person talking about something by saying that, you know, by trying to insult them.
6627906	6636229	Or by using, you know, sensationalist words or trying to show that, you know, an issue is skyrocketing.
6636269	6642331	Or throwing someone off the path to try to make themselves seem like they know what the hell they're talking about when they really don't.
6643924	6653671	If you feel a certain way just because you feel that way, or you have an opinion based on a feeling, just say that.
6653731	6658855	But if you don't have facts to support it, don't inject your shit where you don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
6659636	6659956	The end.
6662037	6662418	Loki!
6663570	6672018	Fuck you to being invited to the Saints Row Hollywood pre-launch event the day before it happens.
6672199	6681588	And yeah, it's just kind of hard to justify paying $400 for a goddamn ticket or driving a total of like 12 hours to and back from L.A.
6681948	6683650	to go play Saints Row for three hours.
6683670	6684551	I would have been in the car.
6686278	6687099	I don't know, Loki.
6687299	6689120	Yeah, but see, I have a wife to contend with as well.
6689140	6690241	Yeah, that's true, that's true.
6690521	6693363	But, you know, hey, if they were going to fly me down or something like that, that's cool.
6693623	6694543	But, see, here's the thing.
6694603	6708512	It's like, not that I would really want to rub elbows with, you know, Lindsay Lohan or anything like that down there, but they had a bunch of people, you know, all the photos are people, you know, taking in the free alcohol and taking pictures and dancing and stuff like that.
6708532	6710354	But no one fucking playing the goddamn game.
6710454	6713155	It was like, goddammit, they're playing the game.
6714856	6715096	Outro Music
6733622	6738785	They had one of the Kardashians or something there, but not any of the famous ones or something.
6739205	6741967	I don't remember who it was, like Rob Kardashian or something.
6741987	6744008	Isn't he the one that's on Dancing with the Stars?
6744208	6744888	Yeah, who was?
6744928	6745949	I don't know who the fuck he is.
6746369	6750031	But, you know, it's just like all these people, like, I wouldn't know who the hell they are.
6750411	6754973	And then they're like, so, but my guy at THQ is awesome, though, for at least sending me the invite.
6755013	6757434	You know, I was like, he's like, I just found out about this yesterday.
6757454	6757935	I'm like...
6759127	6759928	Thank you for watching!
6778471	6781072	No, I would have... Alan would be like, can you take me with you?
6781892	6787374	I seriously... Well, the only reason I know it's $400 is because I looked at the prices and tickets and it just... It was not going to happen.
6787934	6791695	Even if I was able to pay for that, the flights just wouldn't... You got a family to think about now.
6791715	6798577	And the flights just didn't jive and you would have had... I would have to drive 12 hours to play out three hours worth of a game that's coming out in a few weeks.
6798697	6798937	I mean...
6800457	6805023	I would normally do that if I had no restrictions, but I don't make enough for $400.
6805224	6806565	I can just blow away.
6810896	6811457	Alright, fair enough.
6812177	6814760	My FU of the week, I don't have a lot of serious stuff.
6814860	6817002	Things are going relatively well, all things considered.
6817102	6821827	So, FU to, I would say FU to the traffic up in Apple Hill yesterday.
6822888	6825971	Like, and the fact that all of the roads up there are only one lane with stop signs.
6826031	6831817	I mean, I get that it's supposed to be all rural and country, but there comes a point where you just admit you need to build a better off-ramp.
6833991	6834412	That's it.
6835314	6838180	Moving on to a couple more news stories for you guys.
6838200	6841166	And then, of course, Twitter topics and the Skype line very, very soon.
6841226	6841447	Loki.
6842057	6843137	This is kind of exciting.
6843498	6844858	Not in the way you probably think, though.
6845418	6848860	Grand Theft Auto 3 is having its 10th anniversary.
6849400	6853901	So Rockstar is celebrating by porting it to the iOS platform.
6854522	6857143	This would actually be the new iOS stuff.
6857203	6862544	The iPad 2 and iPhone 4S are going to be the only devices that are supporting it, at least on the Apple end.
6862705	6864285	Android phones are also getting it.
6864565	6866266	DroidX 2, HTC, Evo 2.
6867106	6879891	LG Optimus 2X, Motorola Atrix, and Samsung Galaxy S2, as well as Android tablets Acer, Icona, the Asus E-Pad, Motorola Zoom, and Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1.
6882492	6885554	So that game's going to be ported there in HD graphics and stuff like that.
6885574	6890056	Of course, some unique gameplay stuff there, but I don't know.
6890096	6892336	I think it'd be pretty hard to play on a system.
6892557	6895458	I'm just excited about the fact that they're doing that because that means that
6896338	6900460	You know, sooner or later this is coming to Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation.
6900520	6901840	I mean, come on.
6901860	6903081	They're putting in the work to do it now.
6903421	6904181	They're going to do it.
6904521	6907583	And once this comes, then Vice City and then San Andreas.
6907623	6908703	And that's just going to be amazing.
6910064	6919948	One other ridiculous thing, though, that they're having is they're having a 1.6 scale action figure you can buy of Claude from the hero, I guess, of the first game.
6920428	6923309	And, of course, comes with outfits and guns and stuff like that for $150.
6923349	6923409	Wow.
6925710	6932860	Not worth it, but if you're a really big fan, and I'm a huge fan of Grand Theft Auto, but I'm not paying $150 for a fucking toy.
6933741	6933881	No.
6936504	6936684	So.
6937806	6938046	Oh well.
6938787	6939348	It looks neat though.
6941995	6942736	Uh, yeah.
6944317	6948119	I guess any extra money they can get out of that franchise, they will, right?
6949160	6949660	Exactly.
6950841	6952742	I would love to play the game.
6952782	6960627	Apparently, though, they're going to be porting the game later on to other platforms, you know, like just the regular iPhone 4 and stuff like that, but it's not going to be as pretty.
6963008	6970653	And I do think that it does support some of the Bluetooth controllers and stuff like that, so that would be kind of cool to actually play with buttons, but
6971254	6973758	I really just wanted to come to Xbox Live Arcade.
6973898	6976121	Really, I would just say skip 3 and Vice City.
6977183	6978245	Just bring San Andreas.
6978565	6979547	San Andreas is multiplayer.
6979707	6981971	You don't even need to put out Grand Theft Auto 5 anytime soon.
6982572	6983453	People would eat that up.
6984775	6985076	Alright.
6986076	6989057	Moving on to Apple-related news, other iOS news.
6989537	6996180	This has to do with Game Center, which got some minor upgrades in the whole iOS 5 thing, but nothing really to scream about.
6996260	7001602	I mean, yay, it shows you your total achievement points now in comparison to others, and you can have your own little picture.
7001702	7002022	Whoopee!
7002702	7026452	But you gotta wonder if maybe there was other stuff that was supposed to come Because some patents that Apple had filed was talking about avatars Little avatars on game centers, you know, where you could have little hats and hair Pretty much the exact same thing, you know, with the Xbox avatars and the Miis on the Wii That is apparently something that Apple was or is looking at for game center The patents were originally filed in April
7027412	7029434	But obviously we didn't see this in iOS 5.
7029494	7031715	So either it was scrapped or who knows.
7032416	7036899	Don't those remind me of the little figures or the characters from Tiny Tower?
7038360	7039000	Oh, kind of.
7039040	7041382	Yeah, because Tiny Tower kind of has that thing going on with it.
7041442	7046486	But I got to say, honestly, this is just, okay, it's just another version of the me.
7046966	7047947	Avatar is somewhere else.
7047987	7048327	Woo-hoo.
7049008	7050209	So whatever.
7050269	7051329	Game Center is kind of a...
7052489	7055812	I don't know, there's just not a lot to get excited about with Game Center.
7055912	7068022	I mean, I get that Apple's kind of trying to standardize things, but you look at what's going on with things like OpenFaint, and you're kind of like, wow, they seem to be pushing the envelope a lot faster and doing other exciting things with it.
7068062	7078872	But the problem with OpenFaint is that because it's not tied into the iOS, it kind of sometimes can get in the way and is distracting, and a lot of games really push it when you're like, you know what, I'm not interested in all that.
7079412	7086198	so, I don't know this is something I've noticed amongst my iOS gaming alright, DarkSakura, what do you got for us?
7087321	7088381	We have a few things.
7088481	7091683	Well, really just one thing, but it has to do with EVE Online.
7092523	7099105	There is an offer going out for lapsed EVE Online users to save money.
7099165	7106508	So basically, if they reactivate their account, they pay $4.95 for 30 days instead of $14.95.
7108409	7112650	So I guess it's just to get people back in for that month and see if it keeps them hooked.
7115552	7116512	It's very interesting.
7117881	7131308	Well, I'm sure when there's all these other MMOs going on, you know, and of course launches coming up like Star Wars and so forth, you know, these aging MMOs have to do everything they can to kind of get people to look at it again, you know?
7131748	7131988	Yeah.
7132128	7136330	But of course, EVE has that whole spinoff coming to the PlayStation 3 they were talking about at E3.
7136431	7136911	That's true.
7137091	7141013	So that right there is probably going to get a lot of people kind of looking back at EVE, I'm sure.
7141373	7141753	Possibly.
7142113	7142274	Yeah.
7142794	7142874	So...
7143464	7161947	So Sony is apparently looking for, or possibly mulling around if you will, an idea where people can actually get a discount on purchasing UMD games on the Vita if you currently own the actual UMD game.
7162667	7169313	And this is coming from the Japanese language fact that's posted, I guess, on Sony's PlayStation website.
7169753	7178460	They're saying that the fact notes that they're considering a service to offer PSN versions of UMD games users own for a special price.
7178500	7182823	This isn't a confirmation, obviously, but it's something that they're considering.
7182883	7184845	Details of the service will be announced later.
7185185	7190109	I don't know how the hell they're going to be able to do that, but maybe you have to pop it in your PSP and...
7190726	7192695	It recognizes it's there, something like that.
7193799	7195406	I don't know how that really works.
7197133	7226476	yeah it says I guess also it says that the Vita will play all downloadable PSP games except for game archives which I guess is the Japanese label for the PlayStation 1 classics Neo Geo games and retro downloads so you're not going to be able to play your PlayStation 1 games I guess but maybe they're going to have a different way to play them later on or something oh well that's too bad
7228431	7229474	Not surprising, though.
7229955	7232481	Well, it's hard to support all this backwards, you know?
7232601	7235889	It's akin to the whole PlayStation 2 games that are now showing up on PlayStation 3.
7236370	7237051	You know, I don't know.
7237172	7238154	It's kind of what it reminds me of.
7239414	7240435	South Park, Tenorman's Revenge
7268530	7269850	Do you remember Scott Tenorman?
7270110	7276392	That was the character where his parents were chopped up and Cartman fed the parents into chili to Scott Tenorman.
7276412	7280193	That was one of the most fucked up episodes of South Park that there was.
7280233	7282353	Well, it was a play on Titus, right?
7282933	7285754	One of those movies that had come out around the same time.
7286334	7289715	And it was one of those so sick it was funny.
7289955	7290195	Yeah.
7290415	7290575	So...
7291895	7298580	Anyhow, I guess it was being shown at Comic-Con and some screenshots have come out of it.
7299541	7301382	It looks like it might be a little more of a platformer.
7301402	7302483	They have a trailer for it.
7302523	7303624	It's actually pretty cool looking.
7303744	7304945	And ManBearPig is in it.
7305185	7305846	Oh, is there a trailer?
7305966	7306866	There is a trailer for it.
7307026	7310929	Let me find it.
7310949	7311830	It is pretty cool looking.
7311890	7315253	It looks like a four-player side-scroller game.
7315713	7316333	Okay, here we go.
7316934	7317774	I've got a trailer here.
7317915	7318495	Let's take a look.
7327065	7328406	Is he building a robot?
7328466	7328986	Oh, I get it.
7329066	7332328	Begin ginger-vacation.
7332408	7332628	Nice.
7351348	7352229	There's some gameplay.
7353210	7355233	It looks like it might be like four players simultaneous.
7355593	7355753	Yeah.
7355773	7356975	It's kind of what it looks like.
7356995	7358016	You can play as the goon.
7358036	7359398	I've been waiting a long time for this.
7361127	7362648	That might be cute.
7363088	7364809	A lot of those South Park games are kind of dopey.
7365590	7367771	God, there was one that was especially terrible.
7367832	7368592	What was it on?
7368632	7370453	I want to say it was on the Nintendo 64.
7371034	7372875	The South Park kart racing game?
7373515	7374096	Not even that.
7374116	7375036	That was pretty bad too.
7375096	7376597	There was a first person shooter game.
7376737	7377678	It wasn't a kart racing game.
7377778	7379619	It was a first person shooter.
7379779	7381060	It was a special kind of terrible.
7382561	7383422	I remember that.
7383482	7385383	I played that.
7385423	7386244	Hopefully it's better than that.
7388806	7389086	All right.
7389186	7393687	Oh, even TigerClaw in our chatroom at chat.orange.com just brought that game up, the N64 game.
7393727	7394967	And Ranma's like, I remember that.
7395388	7397228	Yeah, I'd like to forget that that ever happened.
7397288	7397628	Thanks.
7398928	7399188	All right.
7399248	7400129	Skyplane is open.
7400149	7411271	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio if you want to give us a call and talk about anything that we have talked about tonight so far on the show or maybe something that we missed that you were hoping we would talk about.
7411571	7411891	I don't know.
7412251	7414172	Meanwhile, going to some Twitter topics.
7415432	7426140	Which I'm signed into the wrong account I was about to read tweets that were sent to me Not to the show Oh Rob, you're being a diva Are you reading my mother's Twitter?
7426160	7426200	No
7431286	7432087	Going to some tweets.
7432107	7433988	We have a couple tweets here from Tigerclaw305.
7434048	7438871	He always likes to tweet us some stories that otherwise might slip through the cracks.
7439232	7442033	The first one that he tweeted us is about a Spider-Man video game.
7442093	7444375	The amazing Spider-Man video game coming in 2012.
7445276	7446536	It's supposed to be open world.
7446917	7449438	And I guess there's teaser posters all over New York Comic Con about it.
7450099	7454642	Obviously the new movie, because they're rebooting the franchise that wasn't that dead.
7454682	7456243	But whatever, they're rebooting it in 2012.
7457063	7457944	So that's on its way.
7458064	7459265	They also have a trailer for that too.
7459825	7460325	Is there really?
7460385	7462906	Let me see if we can find... Well, hold on, because we're getting a call.
7463126	7468247	I'll look for a trailer for this while we take our call, but we do have a call coming in, so let's go do it.
7468567	7469487	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
7469507	7469827	Who's this?
7470407	7472608	Hey, it's DJ Ranma S from Anime Jam Session.
7472708	7473788	How are you guys doing tonight?
7473808	7475408	I am fantastic, Ranma.
7475488	7476169	How are you doing?
7477429	7478409	I am tired.
7478609	7484750	I am sitting here pouring over photos, pouring over videos, and sipping my spiked apple juice.
7485371	7487511	Now, you were at New York Comic Con this weekend, right?
7488055	7488655	Yes, I was.
7488795	7489456	All four days.
7489536	7491177	And are you working on your Fernando cosplay?
7492858	7493298	No.
7494058	7495459	And screw you, Loki.
7495779	7496039	No.
7496420	7496760	No.
7497080	7497380	No.
7497760	7498040	No.
7499361	7499721	All right.
7500722	7501842	You know we just got to give you a hard time.
7502863	7506065	Besides, I have a Buddha belly, so that ain't happening anytime soon.
7506525	7506865	All right.
7506885	7507125	All right.
7507165	7508466	Well, how was the con?
7508506	7508986	Tell us about it.
7509006	7509967	Okay, first, I got to ask.
7509987	7510387	I got to ask.
7510487	7511808	Did you play Bungie Ferret Tossing?
7512608	7512828	Yes.
7512868	7513509	Yes, I did.
7513529	7517271	And we do have a demo video up.
7518140	7518800	Woohoo!
7519221	7521242	And I just posted it in the chat room.
7521302	7523243	Was this blessed by YYR?
7524124	7524984	Yes, yes it was.
7525005	7525805	Okay, just making sure.
7526205	7528827	Plus, I am also press, so you know.
7529607	7530028	Oh, I see.
7530068	7530668	Oh, you're a press.
7530748	7532009	Oh yeah, because you're out of my jam session.
7533050	7534010	Alright, let's see what this is.
7535342	7535642	Action.
7536043	7537044	DJ Ranma S in.
7537164	7540046	Okay, first off, you want to cut out the guy that says action.
7540086	7541227	You do know that, right?
7541807	7545510	You do realize I'm up here rushing, trying to get the video online.
7545771	7547312	All right, all right, all right.
7547372	7549273	I love the poster in the background, too.
7549334	7550394	How long is your snake?
7552056	7553897	That's also, he also has it as a shirt.
7554097	7555599	Clever, clever.
7556339	7560843	We're going to check out OLR's exclusive game, Bunget Ferret Tossin'.
7563973	7564914	Are you playing this in hard mode?
7565034	7565775	Oh, we're watching it.
7572621	7574522	And so you're kind of moving around on the helicopter.
7574542	7576844	It doesn't look like things are going too crazy on the ground right now.
7577585	7578346	Oh, there go the ferrets.
7579867	7580968	It's kind of interesting.
7581708	7587554	This strikes me as like a mix between like a twin stick shooter, like Geometry Wars, where you're trying to dodge all the bullets.
7588454	7588895	But yet...
7590131	7619214	It's a whole different element, like you don't shoot the same way It's like this mixture of Defender and Geometry Worms We can't fix the chopper in battle, so be careful Now the blood splats aren't really coming through very well on this video, but still Very cool Tell us a little more You can see the ground's all bloody, that's awesome
7619881	7624506	Tell us a little more while we watch the rest of this gameplay video here.
7625147	7631614	I have to say that is one of the most bloodiest 8-bit style video games I have played in a very long time.
7631634	7632535	Which is a good thing.
7632595	7634097	If it has our name on it, it better.
7637819	7638199	Awesome.
7638840	7640461	Well, what else did you see in New York Comic Con?
7641361	7649906	Some other stuff, but before I continue, if you notice, the ferret that Fernando is tossing looks familiar if you follow Naruto.
7650846	7651267	Really?
7651667	7652287	Oh, is it?
7652888	7654588	Oh, that is hers, isn't it?
7655029	7655729	Yes, it is.
7656229	7656570	Awesome.
7656710	7657030	Awesome.
7658331	7660732	Well, of course, it's a video game.
7660752	7662893	There's got to be a Naruto reference in it someplace.
7663333	7664234	But there's a kill counter.
7666764	7673991	Final Fantasy XIII 2 You can jump in this game It's about freaking time I thought Square Enix didn't know how to handle jumping
7690529	7719433	I played the demo it was pretty fun and I hate to say it I am not saying this as a 360 fanboy but they did have the 360 and the PS3 versions both sitting on display same model TVs and looks like the graphics in the 360 version looks a little bit sharper a little bit crisper interesting because usually you would think with the whole Blu-ray stuff that it would look a little better on the PlayStation 3 pretty much and I was kind of shocked by that
7719960	7720380	Mega Man Legends
7748881	7761329	They actually went to the Capcom booth and protested them canceling Mega Man Legends 3 They should have done an Occupy Capcom booth Occupy Capcom, is that what was going on?
7762950	7772596	One of them actually had a sign, I might have taken a picture, Occupy Capcom Nice, we are the 99% of gamers that want a new Mega Man game Nice
7773667	7784773	and they're all walking around the convention center trying to get people to follow with them and I saw one of them and I said, you do realize it's not going to happen, right?
7784793	7787415	They're like, you shut up, it'll happen!
7787435	7788956	And I'm like, sure it will.
7791437	7795900	It's going to be a lot harder once certain individuals have left Capcom, but okay.
7795920	7797641	Yeah, pretty much.
7798340	7800162	Nice, but they didn't get thrown out of the booth?
7800783	7818201	No, not at all That's good, I was thinking maybe there was going to be some drama, some throwdown, some cops called No, no, no, we were too far away from that I see, I see Alright, well, I don't know what else to ask you about the con, anything else you want to share with us tonight?
7819783	7820704	Uh, let's see
7823222	7825704	I would say the cosplays.
7825764	7833850	The most popular gaming cosplay I saw this weekend was pretty much Link, Mario, and Peach.
7835110	7837532	So just kind of your traditional Nintendo characters.
7837572	7838693	Very traditional.
7839332	7845558	Yeah, and also there's this one guy, he cosplays the Red Trainer from Pokemon.
7845838	7852844	He actually was walking around the convention center with his bike, playing the Pokemon theme as you're walking through, as you're playing the game.
7853165	7854145	That background music.
7854946	7855286	Nice.
7856247	7857308	I thought that was pretty cool.
7857368	7858649	Sounds pretty intricate to me.
7860551	7861332	He's one step up.
7861512	7863474	I would be too lazy to do something like that.
7864875	7865616	At least you're honest.
7866854	7867274	Pretty much.
7867535	7868175	All right, my friend.
7868195	7871839	Well, do you have anything else you want to share with us tonight before I let you go?
7871999	7876524	Not now, but I think I'm waiting on a response from somebody.
7876604	7878245	Here's some other interesting information.
7878265	7879867	As soon as I hear it, you'll be the first to know.
7880448	7880868	All right.
7880968	7881529	Hmm.
7881669	7882069	Interesting.
7882129	7882410	All right.
7882570	7883150	Keep me posted.
7883631	7884051	Will do.
7884251	7884512	All right.
7884552	7884912	Later, buddy.
7885372	7885733	You got it, bro.
7887694	7891656	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.
7891996	7895498	I'm very appreciative of the video of Bungee Ferret Tossing since we weren't there to play it.
7896239	7898019	I'm excited that it's only going to be a dollar.
7899200	7900741	That's a bargain price for a game.
7901241	7902702	I love that YYR is doing that.
7902722	7906324	It really is a labor of love for the craft of creating games.
7906424	7906864	It's awesome.
7907544	7910305	Back to the Twitter at twitter.com slash OLR.
7910365	7921588	Another tweet coming to us from Tigerclaw who links us to this article on Gamasutra about a mobile game that promotes social network safety for children.
7921668	7924989	I thought we had something similar to this last week, but I don't think it's quite the same thing.
7925290	7931331	Because I think this one is now an iOS game that's coming out and it's about Be Seen, which is like a network.
7931371	7936213	And I guess it's like telling people not to share all their personal shit online.
7937711	7938251	You know what I mean?
7938931	7941532	You know, because some kids don't really know better, right?
7942672	7947493	So you've got to teach them how to handle social networking appropriately.
7949534	7951054	All right, let's go to another call.
7951074	7953135	We're getting more calls on the line here, so we'll go to another one.
7953175	7954055	Hi, you're on Orange Challenge Radio.
7954075	7954415	Who's this?
7955155	7956136	Hey, it's CD Thunder.
7956296	7956956	Hey, CD Thunder.
7956976	7957636	What's on your mind, buddy?
7958876	7959236	Not much.
7959296	7961017	I have a couple things I'd like to talk about.
7961157	7961757	All right, what's up?
7963171	7968693	Well, I went to the mall today and there's an arcade game that I just couldn't stop playing.
7968753	7971114	I was like, oh, man, this is so good.
7971134	7971995	I gotta keep playing.
7972075	7972715	You know what I mean?
7972875	7973355	Yeah, of course.
7973375	7973855	What game's that?
7974876	7975876	I'm not sure if you've heard of it.
7975896	7977597	It's called Paradise Lost.
7979278	7980518	I don't think I have heard of that.
7980558	7981539	Tell me the setup for this.
7983359	7991263	It's basically you're this survivor on an island and you go from gun to gun and just mowing down all these guys.
7991843	7992063	That's...
7992981	7994442	That's how you pretty much do.
7994482	7997864	And then you get these different bosses like helicopters and stuff.
8000426	8001807	So it's pretty basic.
8002007	8010013	But there's one boss that's called the Chucker, and it's this mutant-looking thing that just throws exploding barrels at you.
8010535	8035699	I'm finding that this is apparently Paradise Lost is an arcade version of the series Far Cry and specifically Far Cry Instincts so now the way you're describing the game kind of makes a lot of sense so this is some type of like port to it I guess it's a rail shooter arcade game port of Far Cry Instincts and it was made in 2007 and I guess it uses hardware very similar to Aliens Extermination so kind of neat
8037694	8045096	Well, it would be kind of cool if they actually put Paradise Lost on the Wii or some other system because it's just a lot of fun.
8045136	8045896	It's very addicting.
8046096	8049897	Well, just so you know, if you do really like the game, you might want to check out the Far Cry series.
8049977	8054238	Far Cry Instincts was on the original Xbox, not the 360, but the old, old Xbox.
8055058	8057079	It was actually made in like 2005.
8057139	8063520	So if you like those type of games, you know, you like that, you might enjoy the Far Cry series, which, you know, they're still making those games.
8063560	8064260	Like Far Cry 3 is...
8066661	8068082	Coming out next year?
8068362	8069323	I don't think it's out yet.
8069603	8071505	No, it's definitely not out yet, but it's coming out soon.
8071825	8075828	Wasn't that the one they were showing the big trailer for and it was like really like creepster looking?
8075868	8077409	They kicked the guy down the cave.
8077469	8078170	Was that Far Cry?
8078510	8079831	Or am I mixing it up with another series?
8080772	8081292	I think it was.
8081652	8082093	I think it was.
8083474	8084214	I don't know offhand.
8084475	8085635	Anyway, sorry, CD Thunder.
8085676	8086476	Don't mean to digress.
8086516	8087497	What else did you check out?
8088966	8096768	That was the only arcade game that I want to talk about, but the next thing I'd like to discuss is what I think would make a really good game.
8097148	8097528	Alrighty.
8099268	8106709	I'm not sure if you agree with me on this, but what if somebody combined House of the Dead and Carnival and made it just one game?
8107870	8109410	That would already be House of the Dead.
8110170	8110830	House of the Dead.
8111050	8112151	How so, DarkSakura?
8112511	8114291	Because it's kind of like the shooter and everything?
8115295	8123477	Or maybe I'm picturing in what CD Thunder is describing like an evil carnival, maybe, like a possessed... I guess that is carnival, isn't it?
8125198	8128439	Well, the thing is... I think carnival just needs more zombies.
8130419	8141362	The thing is you go to the house of the dead, and along the way you find this girl, and you rescue her, and she'd tag along with you throughout the entire...
8142803	8154793	rest of the game and then you think you're done and then one of the evil characters from the current evil game comes out and kidnaps her and then you have to go in there and rescue her.
8154933	8157895	So it would be one long game instead of just two separate ones.
8158356	8162359	Well, you should tweet the idea to Sega because anything is possible through Twitter.
8162399	8164921	That's something we've learned very recently.
8166702	8167043	All right.
8167423	8170926	Well, CD Thunder buddy, I'm going to let you go so we can get more calls if you have any final thoughts.
8175419	8176280	Can I plug something?
8176941	8177221	Okay.
8179524	8181287	It's another gaming podcast.
8181347	8183169	It's called Four Player Podcast.
8184451	8185232	It's really good.
8186493	8190899	I'm not saying that this one isn't really good, but it's another really good one.
8191934	8193494	No, I'm familiar with that show.
8193514	8198235	It is a fine show, and I think some of their folks follow me on Twitter and vice versa.
8198335	8206617	So they do a lot with the Justin TV integration, which is something we kind of used to do, but our radio show is not that exciting to watch.
8206817	8214239	So getting a webcam back here hasn't exactly been a high priority for us, but they're a little better at integrating all the video, the actual gameplay and all of that.
8215119	8217580	Well, if you had a webcam, everybody could see Shermie.
8218120	8218600	Yeah.
8218960	8220600	Maybe we just need a Shermie cam.
8220620	8223981	We'll put a camera under the table and you can see my feet and Shermie.
8224241	8224962	We'll think about that.
8225142	8225982	That's a good suggestion.
8226382	8226602	All right.
8226642	8227982	Later, buddy.
8228182	8229243	Bye.
8229263	8229643	Bye.
8229663	8233644	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio if you want to give us a call.
8234524	8237225	And I think we're out of tweets.
8237365	8238905	Not a lot of people tweeting us this week.
8239345	8240105	Although I will say this.
8240125	8241526	This actually came in earlier in the week.
8241986	8245867	Zushi13 had tweeted us saying, I got to play some Bungie Ferret Toss.
8245987	8246967	It's a really fun game.
8248510	8257874	Oh, 13forever tweeted us saying, sweet, Scribblenauts for iOS is real and ready for install.
8257994	8260595	And tweets us that, yeah, Scribblenauts came out on the iOS this week.
8260615	8261815	I remember seeing that in the App Store.
8262235	8264876	Now, my iPhone broke this week.
8265016	8266657	My sleep button no longer works.
8267457	8275240	And it's really killed my desire to spend a lot of money on iOS products right now, especially when I can't get a new iPhone until January.
8275620	8277341	And I was talking about this a little bit on Bobby's show.
8278001	8282723	But, uh, you know, I'm not exactly in a rush to replace my iPhone.
8282763	8284844	In fact, now I'm thinking maybe I want a different phone.
8285424	8287165	But yet I've spent all that money on apps.
8287825	8288645	I don't know what to do.
8289806	8290246	Wah.
8290746	8291686	I guess we'll just take another call.
8291726	8292587	Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.
8292607	8292967	Who's this?
8293647	8294287	This is Shane.
8294647	8295608	Hey, Shane, what's up?
8296868	8298389	Um, not a whole lot.
8298429	8303271	I just wanted to say the word Skylanders so I could hear the rant that Loki went on earlier.
8303291	8306552	That's your fault for not being here at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.
8308044	8310190	I had a work thing I had to go to.
8310571	8311293	It was pizza.
8311374	8312697	Like, I was gonna pass up pizza.
8315635	8316335	Well, Loki?
8317556	8318337	I already made him a rant.
8318797	8323800	I'm just saying, you know, yeah, it's cool that your store sold out of them or whatever.
8325441	8327902	I hope those four copies went pretty fast.
8329163	8330383	I had more than four copies.
8330464	8339929	I had like eight on PS3, eight on 360, eight on Wii, and four on 3DS, and then all the little freaking boxes of the single figurines.
8340089	8341050	Do you have games?
8341110	8343131	I mean, eight doesn't sound like a lot.
8343191	8344532	Of course, granted, you're in Kansas.
8344732	8348094	I'm guessing it's six because they came in case slots of six.
8350236	8351497	That's only one case of each.
8351597	8352297	That's not a lot.
8353258	8357661	I'm curious if there's other games that maybe have the potential to sell eight copies in a day.
8357721	8359001	I mean, that doesn't sound like that many.
8359762	8366566	Well, across multiple systems, on a Sunday release that's not a Nintendo game is pretty significant.
8366606	8368648	I'm optimistic that they're going to fail still.
8369168	8372210	Although I did see, I saw a review from like some site.
8372610	8375092	It's the only review that they have right now that's like 8 out of 10.
8375572	8381036	But, you know, like Kotaku, for example, they're like, I think this concept is pretty awesome.
8381156	8385499	Yeah, you think it's pretty awesome because they sent you five fucking copies of the game and all the toys.
8385959	8387160	Well, this looks like fun.
8387720	8389742	Are you kidding me whilst I open this up?
8391122	8391783	Okay, fine.
8392130	8392410	Whatever.
8392930	8398353	But reading the feedback from people that are looking at the trailers and stuff, they're like, what the fuck happened to Spyro?
8398794	8399974	What have they done to this guy?
8400715	8402195	He looks pretty mean now.
8402295	8406538	And the 3DS one comes with a black version, like an evil Spyro or something.
8406778	8407058	Yeah.
8407258	8410880	And that was kind of cool looking, but he still didn't look like Spyro.
8412249	8416290	Let me kind of turn this on you and ask you about something that we also talked about in the beginning of the show.
8416370	8420791	No, yes, because last week on the show you were here defending Final Fantasy XIV and saying I should play it again.
8420931	8421511	And I did.
8422072	8423732	And I talked about that at the top of the show.
8423972	8425672	Which you said was pretty negative sounding.
8425712	8428313	Well, I would say I gave it a mixed review.
8428473	8429834	Because there are things I like about it.
8429994	8433594	Like the whole way you can mix and match your talents.
8433955	8436895	And I thought there's so much more to do for a single player now.
8436995	8439396	And I realized that a lot of the crafting jobs...
8439796	8441558	are really there for the single player experience.
8441678	8445381	You're not exactly going to party up to go do botany together.
8445401	8447103	That's really part of the single player game, which is cool.
8447123	8450185	Ooh, but we should, because that'd be hilarious.
8450345	8460815	But my real question for you is, and then just so you know, the bottom line is, it's better, and it's much better than fucking garbage, which is what I called it last time, but I'm not going to pay the monthly fee.
8461335	8469875	and that was the news that came out this week is that now they're charging a monthly fee for Final Fantasy XIV you didn't know that last week what's your reaction to all the news about Final Fantasy XIV this week?
8471195	8499785	in regards to the monthly fee I feel like it's way too early and I also feel like that's not what the dev team was going for because recently in a post they said that the game's only like halfway to where they want it to be and they weren't going to start charging a fee until it was 100% that way so clearly that came from the top down I don't feel like it's really ready for a monthly fee but I will pay it because I am having fun
8500805	8521381	and in terms of like the other things they announced like completely rebooting the game again I'm actually kind of excited for that because the one fake little screenshot they made looked really cool and they're adding classes I care about and it's more Final Fantasy now it sounds like really Final Fantasy 11 2 with all the changes they're doing
8521941	8528367	I gotta admit, from that screenshot, I don't know why, but I was thinking it looked like Phantasy Star Online with Final Fantasy characters.
8528387	8532771	That would be amazing, especially since we probably aren't getting Phantasy Star Online 2.
8533131	8535293	It was one sexy-looking screenshot.
8535373	8537055	It is a concept.
8537415	8540017	Not until it's in my hot little hands.
8541158	8546163	And it seems weird to me that they're going to make the graphics look better, yet allow the game to run on lower-end PCs.
8546183	8546263	Yeah.
8546443	8548904	It's just about optimization, though, from what I understand.
8549204	8551685	This game is horribly optimized for anything.
8551865	8557767	Once again, though, we're talking a year's time that this thing is going to be fully rebooted.
8559768	8564769	I just can only imagine the games are going to look still even better than they are now.
8566090	8569891	To me, it's almost like the Wii U, I guess.
8570211	8572352	How they're kind of late to the game with everything.
8572412	8574493	It's like, oh, look, we're pushing these HD graphics.
8574853	8577393	that everyone else has been putting out for years now.
8579394	8580294	It kind of seems like to me.
8580794	8581574	But it still looks sexy.
8582834	8583995	Will it be good enough for me to play?
8584035	8588696	It does have the uniqueness of being a Japanese MMO that's pretty big here in the States.
8589796	8591076	At least Final Fantasy XI is.
8591436	8597777	And there's not a lot of Asian, in general, no matter what country, MMOs that do very well here.
8597877	8601778	Most of the MMOs that are doing well here are developed by studios that are here.
8602398	8604761	Like WoW, of course, is the big one, developed by Blizzard.
8605122	8606283	So, you know, I don't know.
8609107	8612912	I guess that was really all I wanted to ask you, was about Final Fantasy XIV and where you're at with that.
8613233	8618600	So are you going to be paying for WoW and Final Fantasy XIV, or are you saying you're into XIV so much you might cancel WoW?
8619720	8620942	Um, yeah, I might.
8621022	8626730	It depends on what BlizzCon says this week and how fun 4.3 is.
8627070	8635482	Also, when it comes out, because who knows how long that is, but I'm just sick of, you know, grinding Rep in Firelands and jumping.
8636320	8639122	So Final Fantasy XIV is something pretty and distracting right now, right?
8639722	8649688	Yes, and it's still free because they said they'll give us ample notice of when it actually goes to pay and I'm guessing it's more like early December instead of late November.
8649829	8651730	So I still have like two months.
8652210	8655172	I'm wondering how my 30-day trial is going to play into it.
8655232	8657093	I totally am going to get screwed with that.
8657133	8660035	Like my 30-day trial will be up and then the fee kicks in.
8660075	8661476	It's like I didn't get shit.
8662116	8664258	I didn't get shit like everybody else got.
8664378	8664658	Oh well.
8665234	8666255	Oh, well, I'm part of that, too.
8666295	8668696	I mean, I've only been playing for, what, a week longer than you?
8668776	8670276	You didn't even buy the damn game.
8670316	8672057	It was comped to you, so shut up.
8672637	8673698	I did get it for free.
8673718	8676879	But I still won a free 30-day trial, too.
8677880	8681542	I paid half what most people paid for it new, but I still paid 25 bucks for it.
8681962	8683803	And then my DVD was damaged.
8684483	8685283	And screw that.
8686244	8689505	Square needs to learn how to make a PC game, for fuck's sake.
8690446	8692447	I do think the game is going to be pretty neat on PlayStation 3.
8693707	8696949	Yeah, I think I might jump to that when it comes out.
8697049	8698971	Do you think the game can save itself?
8699351	8703954	Do you think a game can actually relaunch and be credible?
8704854	8710598	I think it can, but probably not to the extent that they're hoping for.
8711178	8713460	I think it'll bring in a few more people.
8714020	8719864	It'll probably keep the current players, but it's not going to be a huge relaunch.
8720444	8724677	Despite what they want You're not going to get thousands and thousands of more people playing
8725026	8742174	I think honestly the smart thing for them to do is to go to the Guild Wars model where you're not totally free to play but once you buy the game you get to play online for free and they should look at doing expansions for money or just more regular content updates like what they're doing with Final Fantasy XI that cost money and that's how they should do it.
8742234	8743594	If they did that I'd buy it.
8743734	8746055	The monthly fee is not going to work for this game anymore.
8746075	8751638	Except for Final Fantasy XI does those little baby expansions and still charges you a monthly fee.
8751798	8753779	But Final Fantasy XI is also a better game.
8754680	8755700	Ooh, that's true.
8756861	8757142	All right.
8757202	8757902	It's not as pretty.
8758923	8759163	All right.
8759223	8760585	On that note, I'm going to let you go, all right?
8761105	8761365	All right.
8761505	8761706	All right.
8761726	8761986	Take care.
8762006	8762506	Bye.
8762546	8762867	Bye.
8764288	8764588	All right.
8764608	8766250	I guess that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
8766570	8770033	Sorry to those of you that didn't get through, but why don't you think about writing us an email?
8770433	8774697	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send us an email if you'd like.
8775357	8777139	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com or, of course, Twitter.
8777239	8778600	We had a very empty Twitter tonight.
8778620	8779341	I'm very sad.
8779421	8781323	Twitter.com slash OLR.
8782023	8784164	Alright, well that's going to wrap up another show.
8784344	8788066	I've got to ask though, DarkSakura and Loki, if they have any last minute stories they want to throw out here?
8788807	8790728	I've started a political social blog.
8791128	8791508	Oh dear.
8792889	8794490	Wait a minute, women think independently now?
8795703	8796604	I'm teasing.
8799905	8800346	Girl.
8802227	8803567	She's trying very hard not to laugh.
8803607	8806369	Like she wants to give me that stern I hate you look, but she can't do it.
8806389	8808670	Rob's going to take me to Pinkberry to appease me.
8808830	8809510	Oh, whatever.
8810011	8810331	All right.
8810891	8811071	No.
8811832	8812752	Vote no on that.
8813192	8814533	That's my political blog.
8815974	8816274	All right.
8816294	8817335	You know I'm just giving you a hard time.
8817355	8817795	Yeah, I know.
8818035	8818675	Good luck with that.
8818715	8822858	That's what you're... I was going to do another joke, but I can't.
8823018	8823958	No, it's my second blog.
8824379	8824679	All right.
8825579	8827320	Cause my other blog's like about girly shit.
8828021	8828721	Okay, alright.
8829822	8833084	Alright, uh, Loki, any last minute news you want to get into?
8833104	8838207	Uh, they're supposed to be doing a Layton Brothers game for iPhone sometime soon.
8838367	8840508	I'm assuming this is only going to be on the Japanese iOS, so.
8842418	8842878	Thanks for watching!
8862965	8867590	I want to read this because this guy said after five years listening, he's finally listening to a live show.
8867630	8869813	It's Swongtong is the name in chat.
8869913	8875258	And Swongtong asks, how come MMOs on PlayStation 3 don't use the mouse and keyboard?
8875859	8877401	Actually, some do.
8877481	8882987	And I believe Final Fantasy 14 is still they're going to plan on using a keyboard even when it rolls out to the PlayStation 3.
8883507	8888348	And everything on PlayStation 3 is all Bluetooth and USB anyway, right?
8888788	8891149	Like I know on Xbox 360, you can hook in a keyboard.
8891189	8893689	You can play Final Fantasy XI on 360 with a keyboard.
8893769	8895950	I used to do that when it first came out.
8896450	8899931	So as far as PlayStation 3 goes, you can put in a keyboard.
8900371	8902691	You can type messages and so forth.
8903032	8904632	As far as MMOs embracing it...
8904972	8908094	Well, maybe the keyboard adoption policy isn't maybe high enough to do that.
8908134	8913739	But I think for a game like Final Fantasy XIV, like if I were to play that on the PlayStation 3, I definitely would have to have a keyboard.
8914439	8917762	Luckily, I already have one that's specifically for the gaming consoles.
8918062	8918722	It lights up blue.
8918762	8919363	It's really pretty.
8920444	8920684	All right.
8921404	8923506	Loki, any other stories for us tonight?
8926255	8944849	Uh, no, the only other story I have is not really gaming related, but my wife is trying to download the version of Firefox that is British English so that all of her stuff will be spellchecked into the Queen's English because she's obsessed with Game of Thrones and I don't know why.
8946850	8966330	so she better start learning to use more vowels I would have put that on DarkSakura to do something like that before Nelly I've done it before okay never mind I stand no I've actually got I've actually got a British grammar checker okay because well every so okay here's a true story use less Z's and more U's there you go
8966670	8970933	In college, I actually had this whole thing where I was doing nothing but writing everything in British English.
8970953	8971974	And my teacher let me do it.
8971994	8973775	He just said, pick one and write in it.
8974856	8978278	So, every so often... Less Zeds.
8978618	8978978	Excuse me.
8979279	8979899	Fewer Zeds.
8982081	8982381	All right.
8983421	8984702	Don't use that.
8985002	8985223	What?
8985503	8986163	The Zed word.
8988164	9011748	I guess that's it that's it we're going around and get everybody's final thought and wrapping up another week here at Orange Launch Radio before we do that I really want to thank you guys again for tuning in and spending another week with us thank you so much you know all we ask we do this for free you'll notice there's no advertising or anything like that except for our own other side projects which by the way include the best little Horde House Nazaroth at HordeHouse.com if you like your Warcraft we had a fun show tonight in fact we taped earlier today this is my second podcast of the day

9079258	9082822	Anyhow, let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
9083122	9084744	Loki, what's your final thought tonight?
9087692	9112647	I'm now telling my wife how to add a British English spell check to it and I unfortunately had to add it to mine in order to figure out how to do it so now I can talk in the Queen's English if I really wanted to but I don't want to congratulations you'll have to start tweeting in the Queen's English speaking of the Queen, DarkSakura, your final thought tonight I am disillusioned with this country
9114682	9118045	My final thought tonight is Pretty Rainbow.
9118345	9119246	Pretty Rainbow.
9119866	9123049	Your dresser's little drawer's there.
9123109	9124210	Actually, that is why I bought it.
9124530	9124790	Alright.
