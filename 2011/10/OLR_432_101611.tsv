26000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	33000	Hello my friends out there on the internet
33000	35000	and welcome back to another week of the show
35000	37000	where every gamer has a voice
37000	39000	Orange Lounge Radio
39000	41000	It is episode number 432
41000	43000	for this October 16th, 2011
43000	45000	My name is Rob Roberts
45000	47000	and I'll be joining you over the next few hours
47000	49000	with my awesome co-hosts
49000	51000	First off, the one and the only DarkSakura
51000	52000	Jamie Summers
52000	53000	Hi
53000	55000	How are you Miss Summers?
55000	56000	Caffeinated
56000	57000	Mildly caffeinated
57000	59000	as opposed to extremely caffeinated
59000	61000	Yeah, because I had to decaf coffee
61000	62000	but there's some caffeine in it
62000	63000	Yes, a little bit
63000	65000	It's decaffeinated but not uncaffeinated
65000	67000	Enough to bounce the headache
67000	69000	Say hello as well to tech master Loki
69000	70000	Hello
70000	72000	Who I notice has brought dinner of choice tonight
72000	74000	an entire pizza
74000	76000	Is this triple bacon? Quadruple bacon?
76000	78000	Triple bacon with Red Bull
79000	81000	What a very nerd powered dinner
81000	82000	I love it
82000	84000	Alright, we do tape live every Sunday night
84000	86000	at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern
86000	88000	right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at All Games Radio
88000	92000	www.allgames.com
92000	94000	Join us in our chat room if you are listening live
94000	96000	chat.orangelaunchradio.com
96000	100000	After all, we are the show where every gamer has a voice
101000	103000	By the way, speaking of Bobby
103000	105000	who comes on, of course, before us live every week
105000	107000	he had a great interview tonight
107000	109000	and if you don't listen to his show
109000	110000	you really should check it out
110000	112000	go look at it on iTunes or whatever
112000	115000	because he had an interview with some of the famous voices at Valve
115000	117000	including Dark Soccer, one of your favorites
117000	119000	GLaDOS was on the show tonight
119000	121000	so it was a fun listen
121000	124000	so I guess he ran into them at an Atlanta based convention
124000	126000	Does that mean he's going to have new bumpers?
126000	128000	I would think so
128000	130000	I would hope so man
130000	132000	He's not going to have new bumpers because of that
132000	134000	I hope he did get something out of that
134000	135000	He better
135000	137000	Can you record a bumper for my show?
137000	139000	What I liked
139000	141000	I will be 100% honest
141000	143000	I didn't hear the entire interview
143000	145000	because we used Bobby's time to get some set up
145000	147000	and some stuff of our own done
147000	149000	but I heard about half of it
149000	151000	and one of the questions that I liked was that
151000	153000	he asked them if they'd heard the
153000	155000	commercial for the iPhone 4s
155000	157000	that had GLaDOS' voice over it
157000	159000	we played it on the show last week
159000	161000	and he had heard
161000	163000	because they're a husband and wife
163000	165000	and the husband had heard it, but she hadn't
165000	167000	but he was trying to explain it to her
167000	169000	and it was kind of funny
169000	171000	He had that voice modulation program
171000	173000	because that was dead on
173000	175000	I'm sure it's doable in Adobe Audition
175000	177000	not too difficult
177000	179000	He'd probably just Google GLaDOS Adobe Audition
179000	181000	I don't know, probably a way to do it
181000	183000	Bobby, by the way, is in our chat
183000	185000	He says two new bumpers
185000	187000	Not one, but two
187000	189000	Alright
189000	191000	Let's see what else is going on
191000	193000	in our worlds today
193000	195000	I want to mention this
195000	197000	Usually we have a little chatter here at the top of the show
197000	199000	before we get into our gaming weeks
199000	201000	and I was specifically asked
201000	203000	to mention this to you, Loki, tonight
203000	205000	I've been waiting to tell you about this
205000	207000	Miklotov gave me a call about
207000	209000	two hours before we went live tonight
209000	211000	and he works in gaming retail
211000	213000	and he sells video games
213000	215000	He wanted me to tell you about
215000	217000	a game that came out today
217000	219000	Skylander Spyro Adventure
219000	221000	I saw the ads for that on YouTube
221000	223000	Apparently
223000	225000	if you've been listening to the show for a few weeks
225000	227000	I know Loki is a huge fan
227000	229000	I love it
229000	231000	Alright, quickly reiterate for us
231000	233000	What is this game and why do you hate it?
233000	235000	This game is basically
235000	237000	everything that's wrong about Activision
237000	239000	all lumped up into one game
239000	241000	It's basically Activision taking
241000	243000	Spyro, a franchise that was beloved
243000	245000	years ago
245000	247000	turning it on its edge and basically
247000	249000	making it this thing where
249000	251000	instead of having download content for the game
251000	253000	you're going to have actual physical
253000	255000	add-ons that you buy
255000	257000	as in the little
257000	259000	I wouldn't even call them toys or figurines
259000	261000	that interact with this thing they call a portal
261000	263000	so you basically stick these little figurines
263000	265000	on this little portal device and you get to play
265000	287000	I'm playing this trailer here that I'm not exactly sure what I'm going to see here because I know very little about this game but I guess this is something like
287000	289000	I would buy that for a child
289000	291000	That's more like a morning star
291000	293000	It's a character
293000	295000	It's basically a character
295000	297000	You get these characters
297000	299000	that you can play as
299000	301000	It comes with three including Spyro
301000	303000	Spyro by the way looks like he's
303000	305000	extremely angsty and emo now
305000	307000	He's just ridiculous
307000	309000	Doesn't look anything like the old Spyro
309000	311000	It's just basically a platform hack and slash game
311000	313000	but the game requires you
313000	315000	to switch between these different types
315000	317000	of characters based on different elemental
317000	319000	powers that they have
319000	321000	so like fire characters can't go underwater
321000	323000	and vice versa
323000	325000	so you have to keep switching characters
325000	327000	in order to finish parts of the game
327000	329000	but there's thirty fucking characters that you can buy
329000	331000	for this and might I add
331000	333000	they're all eight dollars
333000	335000	can you imagine if DLC out there
335000	337000	for your favorite game and hell
337000	339000	even Marvel vs. Capcom 3
339000	341000	which had really expensive DLC
341000	343000	it was like five bucks a character
343000	345000	I think
345000	347000	eight dollars for each individual character
347000	349000	or you can get like a three pack I think
349000	351000	maybe twenty bucks or something like that
351000	353000	it's just, it's ridiculous
353000	355000	but they're aiming this at
355000	357000	kids because they did really well with
357000	359000	their stupid toy titles like
359000	361000	Zuzu Pets and
361000	363000	Squinkies and they have a whole
363000	365000	bunch of them coming out this November
365000	367000	but I hate it because one
367000	369000	it's difficult
369000	371000	to sell
371000	373000	kind of on the back side you don't really see any of this
373000	375000	but the way they had us set
375000	377000	up the items and
377000	379000	buy it and stuff is retarded
379000	381000	and um
381000	383000	honestly this looks like another Tony Hawk
383000	385000	ride or you know
385000	387000	something like that
387000	389000	it's just, it's a peripheral game
389000	391000	that's just not going to work and on top of that
391000	393000	you know because they're really trying to attract everybody
393000	395000	it's eighty dollars to buy
395000	397000	it on any platform
397000	399000	including 3DS, eighty dollars
399000	401000	well Mieglatov
401000	403000	wanted me to tell you it's selling
403000	405000	like crazy
405000	407000	apparently they are already sold out
407000	409000	of all, like it just came out today I think
409000	411000	they're already sold out of it on like every
411000	413000	platform but the Wii, most of the
413000	415000	characters are already gone, it's selling
415000	417000	like crazy apparently
417000	419000	well fantastic
419000	421000	and I know that was my reaction
421000	423000	too I was like great, that means
423000	425000	it's going to end up maybe, maybe
425000	427000	still too early to tell being the must have toy
427000	429000	this Christmas, oh well they've already, they're already
429000	431000	in bed with Toys R Us and they
431000	433000	worked a deal with them where they get an
433000	435000	exclusive three character pack for
435000	437000	you know that title being placed on their
437000	439000	hot fifteen toy
439000	441000	titles of the holiday, so yeah
441000	443000	that list is trusting
443000	445000	whatever, you know what
445000	447000	cool, if it does well for them
447000	449000	awesome, but I just
449000	451000	I've asked first off
451000	453000	how many did they bring in because
453000	455000	you know, selling out, trust me
455000	457000	with the quantities that my
457000	459000	customers are buying, selling out
459000	461000	wouldn't be that many titles
461000	463000	alright, I've got to go to our chatroom
463000	465000	at chat.orangelaunchy.com, after all we are the
465000	467000	show where every gamer has a voice and not every gamer
467000	469000	necessarily agrees, going to our chat
469000	471000	rooms, ShadowNextGen says
471000	473000	Skylander Spyro Adventure is the first good
473000	475000	Spyro game in a while, I'm reviewing it right
475000	477000	now and it's a lot of fun
477000	479000	you can beat the new Spyro game
479000	481000	with the three included characters
481000	483000	you are not required to buy anything else
483000	485000	and he also says
485000	487000	Spyro is seventy dollars not eighty dollars
487000	491000	sixty nine ninety nine
491000	493000	you're wrong Loki, you're very
493000	495000	wrong, oh I'm sorry
495000	497000	alright
497000	499000	and DarkTetsuya says I'd be willing
499000	501000	to bet that it sells a million copies
501000	503000	invoking an old
503000	505000	OLR joke from yesteryear
505000	507000	so there you go
507000	509000	I don't know, like that little clip
509000	511000	I looked at didn't look terrible but
511000	513000	I can see where
513000	515000	especially on the back end point
515000	517000	it's probably really annoying where you have
517000	519000	like all these different peripherals
519000	521000	that are going out there for this game
521000	523000	I'm sure this is very uninteresting but let me tell you
523000	525000	how they have it so that you have to order this
525000	527000	yes please start off our show tonight with something completely
527000	529000	uninteresting, ok well anyways
529000	531000	so they sell these twelve characters
531000	533000	this is their first wave of characters that they have
533000	535000	out right now, ok so twelve
535000	537000	different SKUs that you have
537000	539000	but then there's this generic
539000	541000	SKU that represents the full case
541000	543000	but you have to order that generic
543000	545000	SKU by how many characters you want
545000	547000	so it comes twelve to
547000	549000	a case, so you have to order twelve
549000	551000	so it makes it look like, in our system
551000	553000	that you're receiving twelve cases
553000	555000	instead of one case with twelve characters
555000	557000	in it, because it's fucking back asswords
557000	559000	so
559000	561000	I just, I hate that
561000	563000	so it sounds like a lot of your frustration with this game
563000	565000	really has nothing to do with the game itself
565000	567000	it looks terrible, ok, they showed it to me
567000	569000	they showed it to me, I actually got to
569000	571000	play a little bit of the Wii version
571000	573000	and I was just unimpressed, I was just like
573000	575000	big fucking whoop, oh good
575000	577000	why do I need this stupid portal thing
577000	579000	why couldn't this have easily been done
579000	581000	in game without any of these extra characters
581000	583000	oh I know why, because Activision
583000	585000	wants to get in the toy business, because they think
585000	587000	hey, if we can convince stupid parents to
587000	589000	buy these eight dollar pieces of crap
589000	591000	for their kids
591000	593000	then we're in the money
593000	595000	to be fair, it's a good idea
595000	597000	I mean isn't that every Christmas
597000	599000	trying to convince parents to buy an eight dollar piece of
599000	601000	crap for their kids? Yeah, pretty much
601000	603000	but I'm just saying
603000	605000	you're a parent now, would you consider
605000	607000	buying it? No, I would not
607000	609000	you already knew what I was gonna ask
609000	611000	I would not, and you know why? Because it's not a fucking toy
611000	613000	a toy does something
613000	615000	a toy would be something that you could play with
615000	617000	outside of the game, like
617000	619000	ok, if they were action figures or something
619000	621000	like that, like a GI Joe
621000	623000	or Ninja Turtles or whatever, they actually moved
623000	625000	did something, then that's fine
625000	627000	then that's cool if they, you know, worked with the game
627000	629000	and you could play with them outside of it
629000	631000	I could see that worth eight dollars, but they don't do anything
631000	633000	will Josh only be allowed to play with toys
633000	635000	from the 80's? No, he will not
635000	637000	be allowed to just play with toys from the 80's
637000	639000	but I'm just, I'm not gonna buy him something
639000	641000	that doesn't, like
641000	643000	a statue that has no articulation
643000	645000	ok, maybe a little bit of
645000	647000	articulation with these, I don't really know if
647000	649000	maybe their arms move a little bit, but
649000	651000	they're stuck to a base
651000	653000	and
653000	655000	yeah, I know, you know, back in the days
655000	657000	you know, there was the green plastic
657000	659000	army men, and those were also stuck to a base
659000	661000	but you know what, they weren't fucking seventy dollars
661000	663000	either
663000	665000	or eight dollars
665000	667000	alright, is he allowed to have, uh, Tron
667000	669000	toys? Cause maybe I'll, uh
669000	671000	well he's probably too young right now, but maybe in a couple years
671000	673000	right now he just likes books
673000	675000	he likes books, he likes books
675000	677000	uh, we, uh, brought down
677000	679000	out of the attic, uh, Teddy Ruxpin
679000	681000	and uh, Grubby
681000	683000	and um, I actually, we popped
683000	685000	in a tape last night, man, it still
685000	687000	works? It still works! Wow!
687000	689000	Oh, it's, it's in great condition
689000	691000	I kept that in great condition, and we also have
691000	693000	Grubby, and I just had to find a
693000	695000	cable to run to, uh
695000	697000	it just needs an audio cable so that they both
697000	699000	talk, but he thought it was cool for a few
699000	701000	minutes, and then he went and
701000	703000	I don't know, was trying to steal
703000	705000	the iPod. Well, a kid his age
705000	707000	is supposed to have a short detention span, that's what happens
707000	709000	but yeah, I still, you know what
709000	711000	despite the fact that they sold well
711000	713000	in Miklotov's store, I still hope
713000	715000	it fails. Why?
715000	717000	Because I, I hate Activision and their
717000	719000	experiments to try to capitalize on
719000	721000	I mean, seriously, they're trying to run
721000	723000	this franchise into the ground, they've already tried
723000	725000	with a few games already, and
725000	727000	now it's just like, whoring this thing out
727000	729000	it's Spyro and friends, I mean
729000	731000	take Spyro out of it
731000	733000	I mean, seriously, just take him
733000	735000	out of it, I mean, he's not a draw anymore to these
735000	737000	games. I, I do want to move on past the subject
737000	739000	but I gotta say this one other comment from Shadow
739000	741000	Next Gen in our chatroom at chat.com
741000	743000	because I gotta say this does sound pretty cool
743000	745000	Shadow Next Gen says, Skylanders
745000	747000	Spyro's adventure is also cross-console
747000	749000	kids who have a 360 can bring the character
749000	751000	to their friend's house and play on the Wii version
751000	753000	with all the progress that they had on the 360
753000	755000	version, and I gotta admit, that sounds kinda cool
755000	757000	Loki's giving me a
757000	759000	blank stare, he doesn't care
759000	761000	I don't care, I really
761000	763000	don't. Alright,
763000	765000	fine, alright, and Tigerclaw
765000	767000	suggests, put a tape of OLR recorded
767000	769000	on it and watch Teddy Ruxpin talk
769000	771000	like everyone. I don't know if
771000	773000	daddy would necessarily want
773000	775000	Josh hearing him, some of the rants
775000	777000	he does on this program. And also
777000	779000	I don't fucking have a tape recorder anymore
779000	781000	so how would I do that?
781000	783000	I mean, seriously, I'd have to go to my
783000	785000	sister's house and she has
785000	787000	my old, like, stereo system
787000	789000	I think it has a tape player, I'm not sure if it works
789000	791000	anymore because that's usually the first thing to break
791000	793000	I actually, I had a huge old
793000	795000	boombox when I moved this last time
795000	797000	that had tape recorders in it and everything
797000	799000	I fucking threw it away
799000	801000	like, I didn't even try to sell it on
801000	803000	Craig's system, I can't. She uses it for like
803000	805000	a little, you know, cheap ass surround sound
805000	807000	system or whatever, but you know, those
807000	809000	the tape recorders are always the first things that break
809000	811000	on those, it's like the door falls off
811000	813000	or, you know, just something doesn't work
813000	815000	it eats tapes, you know
815000	817000	I saw a great
817000	819000	picture on Facebook
819000	821000	earlier in the week, or maybe it was last week
821000	823000	it had a little picture of a cassette tape
823000	825000	pencil and it said, if you don't know what
825000	827000	these two items have in common
827000	829000	then you're too young
829000	831000	thought it was funny
831000	833000	it was an old people joke, alright
833000	835000	moving on
835000	837000	not so light-hearted news, in fact this is
837000	839000	kind of sad, and it sucks that I'm having
839000	841000	to do a eulogy two weeks in a row
841000	843000	but that's just unfortunately the tech world
843000	845000	has lost a lot of great people in the past couple weeks
845000	847000	and this week we lost Dennis Ritchie
847000	849000	and you may not recognize
849000	851000	the name as readily as you might
851000	853000	say Steve Jobs, who we were talking about last week
853000	855000	but Dennis Ritchie
855000	857000	obviously had a direct impact
857000	859000	on pretty much everything
859000	861000	in the video game world. Why?
861000	863000	Well, if you didn't know, he only
863000	865000	like wrote the C programming
865000	867000	language
867000	869000	that's kind of important because like
869000	871000	every programming language out there is
871000	873000	just about, anyway, like some type of
873000	875000	derivative
875000	877000	derivative, thank you
877000	879000	I don't know why the words gave me, of C
879000	881000	so I even learned
881000	883000	a little bit of C++ when I was in college
883000	885000	I actually originally studied to be a computer programmer
885000	887000	but
887000	889000	it wasn't really free
889000	891000	it worked out terribly and I actually
891000	893000	this is the ironic thing, I actually blame my teacher
893000	895000	I had a horrible, horrible
895000	897000	professor and I don't think
897000	899000	I went to a very good university either
899000	901000	you know
901000	903000	and granted there was some things going on in my personal life
903000	905000	I can't scapegoat everything, a lot of it is
905000	907000	my fault too, but let's
907000	909000	be real, computer science was just not for me
909000	911000	ironically what do I end up doing now for a living
911000	913000	not this show, that's not my day job
913000	915000	trust me, but the job I had that pays
915000	917000	the bills, I'm a teacher
917000	919000	in a corporate environment so I teach
919000	921000	adults much like the professor did so it's
921000	923000	just kind of ironic that that's where I ended up
923000	925000	but anyway
925000	927000	I don't want to get too far away from the topic at hand
927000	929000	obviously we have to tip the hat to Dennis Ritchie
929000	931000	who created C programming language
931000	933000	also was a
933000	935000	co-creator of the Unix operating
935000	937000	system, which is a huge deal
937000	939000	he passed away this week at 70
939000	941000	years old, CAUSE is
941000	943000	undisclosed at this time
943000	945000	so
945000	947000	I think we're ready to move on to our gaming week
947000	949000	I think CAUSE was sadness from hearing that Skylanders
949000	951000	is coming out, stop it, stop it right
951000	953000	now, it's terrible, don't joke, alright
953000	955000	moving on, Dark Sakura
955000	957000	how was your gaming week?
957000	959000	I played stuff other than WoW
959000	961000	oh my god, congratulations
961000	963000	everybody give Dark Sakura a round of applause
963000	965000	yay, woo
965000	967000	well when you came in I was playing Castlevania Symphony of the Night
967000	969000	because we finally got it working on the system
969000	971000	you sure were
971000	973000	and of course I was screaming because
973000	975000	dammit it's not, you know, playing it on the Playstation
975000	977000	and I walked in the house and I said
977000	979000	what is a man? and I threw a glass on the ground
979000	981000	and Dan got very angry
981000	983000	especially since it was our glass
983000	985000	and I called him a miserable
985000	987000	little pile of secrets
987000	989000	he just said, bitch, clean that up
989000	991000	pretty much, yeah
991000	993000	we also played
993000	995000	Guardian Heroes today, we got the demo
995000	997000	and then Dan proceeded to go
997000	999000	wait I want to play Radiant Silvergun
999000	1001000	and decided to play Radiant Silvergun and the demo was like
1001000	1003000	half a level, it's not even
1003000	1005000	worth
1005000	1007000	doing, at least, you know, the first
1007000	1009000	stage is what you can play in Guardian Heroes
1009000	1011000	so
1011000	1013000	we kind of got our Saturn
1013000	1015000	on, I guess, on the Xbox
1015000	1017000	and then he played through a whole bunch of After Burner Climax
1017000	1019000	and that was it
1019000	1021000	good times, so it sounds like you had an Xbox Live arcade party
1021000	1023000	kind of, yeah
1023000	1025000	kind of, yeah, alright, moving on, Loki
1025000	1027000	how was your gaming week?
1027000	1029000	um, playing more Grand Theft Auto
1029000	1031000	and um
1031000	1033000	I'm playing Earth Defense Force
1033000	1035000	this week, more Dead Rising 2
1035000	1037000	off the record though, are you feeling okay?
1037000	1039000	no, I just didn't get
1039000	1041000	around to playing more
1041000	1043000	Earth Defense Force because I was
1043000	1045000	playing Dead Rising off the record
1045000	1047000	and it's alright, it's
1047000	1049000	you know, I know a lot of the
1049000	1051000	complaints that other people have because I didn't really
1051000	1053000	play through Dead Rising 2
1053000	1055000	playing through sandbox mode, it's kind of relaxing
1055000	1057000	actually, although I still don't
1057000	1059000	understand why zombies are easily
1059000	1061000	killed by guns
1061000	1063000	but people are not
1063000	1065000	for some reason, there is like
1065000	1067000	it was great because there was a part in the sandbox
1067000	1069000	mode where this bride's like, help, help
1069000	1071000	so you go up to her and then she starts shooting with
1071000	1073000	a gun, so I pull out
1073000	1075000	a shotgun, you know, because what wins in a gunfight?
1075000	1077000	a bigger gun
1077000	1079000	so the shotgun
1079000	1081000	to a zombie will literally cut it in half
1081000	1083000	it will just sever the body
1083000	1085000	in half and make it explode
1085000	1087000	whereas this woman, who is
1087000	1089000	a bride, can take like eight
1089000	1091000	rounds of a shotgun to the face
1091000	1093000	that doesn't make
1093000	1095000	any sense to me, out of all
1095000	1097000	the game, I mean, completely unrealistic whatsoever
1099000	1101000	I just don't get it, why are the crazies
1101000	1103000	you know, more armored than
1103000	1105000	zombies? I think, granted, the zombies
1105000	1107000	are dead already, but
1107000	1109000	I mean, shit, it should only take a couple
1109000	1111000	of shotgun rounds, and I understand you want to make it
1111000	1113000	difficult because they're like boss characters
1113000	1115000	or whatever, but
1115000	1117000	I don't know, just put more of them on
1117000	1119000	the screen or something
1119000	1121000	but it's a fun game
1121000	1123000	my character is currently dressed up like a cowboy now
1123000	1125000	because I'm still
1125000	1127000	going through every single piece of clothing I find
1127000	1129000	I pick it up
1129000	1131000	is this the game that has the protoman costume I was
1131000	1133000	reading about this week too?
1133000	1135000	even though Capcom hates
1135000	1137000	Mega Man
1137000	1139000	that's why it's protoman, not Mega Man
1139000	1141000	oh, touche
1141000	1143000	alright, well if that's it for your gaming week
1143000	1145000	my gaming week was a lot of
1145000	1147000	games you would not be expecting me to play
1147000	1149000	I played a demo
1149000	1151000	I hate basing
1151000	1153000	my assumptions of games off the demo
1153000	1155000	but let's be real, it's what a lot of us are doing
1155000	1157000	in this day and age of digital download
1157000	1159000	and I downloaded the demo for a game
1159000	1161000	I was interested in at first because I love
1161000	1163000	this series, Burnout Crash
1163000	1165000	is the game I downloaded
1165000	1167000	and I like Burnout an awful lot, the whole series
1167000	1169000	is really fun
1169000	1171000	and the crash mode in
1171000	1173000	Burnout Takedown 3
1173000	1175000	that was fun, it's awesome
1175000	1177000	and when I heard they were making a whole game
1177000	1179000	based on that mode, I was really excited
1179000	1181000	and so I downloaded the demo, I played it
1181000	1183000	and it was the most uninteresting game
1183000	1185000	I think I've played in a very long time
1185000	1187000	I'm sorry to say
1187000	1189000	but the whole switch to 2D
1189000	1191000	was just really boring
1191000	1193000	and how can a game
1193000	1195000	about explosions and crashes
1195000	1197000	and everything be boring
1197000	1199000	but it's like, I don't know, suddenly I feel like it's
1199000	1201000	this really slow moving
1201000	1203000	puzzle based game
1203000	1205000	and for those that haven't
1205000	1207000	played Burnout or know what the crash mode
1207000	1209000	is, basically it's all about creating
1209000	1211000	these huge explosions
1211000	1213000	and you can press a button to blow
1213000	1215000	up your car, essentially
1215000	1217000	and as you fill up a meter, you can blow up your car
1217000	1219000	again and again, you're causing these big
1219000	1221000	chain reactions and pile ups, and I know that sounds
1221000	1223000	really exciting, but in a 2D
1223000	1225000	Xbox Live Arcade title, it was just
1225000	1227000	it was really boring
1227000	1229000	I was so not interested in the game
1229000	1231000	after just, and I tried
1231000	1233000	I played through the whole first little demo and everything
1233000	1235000	I just, I don't want to drop
1235000	1237000	$15 on this, sorry, so
1237000	1239000	sorry Burnout, just not a fan
1239000	1241000	of the crash arcade, sorry
1241000	1243000	I would love to play a game
1243000	1245000	that was like actual racing
1245000	1247000	crash mode though, because that was a lot of fun
1247000	1249000	in Burnout 3, and I can see where maybe
1249000	1251000	somebody thought on paper it was a good idea, but it's
1251000	1253000	not, sorry
1253000	1255000	I also played
1255000	1257000	NBA Jam on Fire edition
1257000	1259000	which, you know what
1259000	1261000	I miss about the original NBA
1261000	1263000	Jam, the fact that it only had three buttons
1263000	1265000	and I don't know, like I tried to play
1265000	1267000	this new NBA Jam and I was just like
1267000	1269000	my characters were not doing anything I wanted them to
1269000	1271000	do, and you know, granted
1271000	1273000	you do not associate me
1273000	1275000	with sports games titles often
1275000	1277000	I'm not really an expert on them
1277000	1279000	but there are a few sports game titles I do
1279000	1281000	enjoy, and most of them have to do from when I was
1281000	1283000	younger and so forth, like
1283000	1285000	things like Blades of Steel and the original
1285000	1287000	NBA Jam, so when I heard there was a new one I wanted to play it
1287000	1289000	I damn near bought the one that was on the Wii
1289000	1291000	I'm so glad I didn't now, because I don't know, I just
1291000	1293000	didn't have a lot of fun, but I think
1293000	1295000	that would be a game that would be more interesting
1295000	1297000	when you're actually in the room with other people
1297000	1299000	because that was the other great thing about NBA Jam
1299000	1301000	that's the game we all played, you know, at
1301000	1303000	sleepovers and stuff growing up
1303000	1305000	when we were at the arcade, so
1305000	1307000	I think to sit there and play it by myself was
1307000	1309000	a little bit of a snore fest, especially when I was just
1309000	1311000	getting frustrated with my characters, and I was just like
1311000	1313000	eh, I'd like to go play something
1313000	1315000	else now, thanks
1315000	1317000	so, um
1317000	1319000	then the other game I played this week
1319000	1321000	so
1321000	1323000	I spent quite a bit of time
1323000	1325000	this week with
1325000	1327000	Final Fantasy XIV
1327000	1329000	I, after the phone call
1329000	1331000	last week, Mikolatov
1331000	1333000	pestered me and pestered me, and
1333000	1335000	finally I decided to buy the game on Amazon
1335000	1337000	because I found it for like 25 bucks
1337000	1339000	new, because you know it's pretty easy to find right now
1339000	1341000	and I got
1341000	1343000	the game, it took me
1343000	1345000	a while to install, that was the first
1345000	1347000	thing that pissed me off about it, because my
1347000	1349000	DVD was borked or something where my drive
1349000	1351000	wouldn't even read it, I had to dump all the
1351000	1353000	files to Alan's computer, because his drive
1353000	1355000	could read it, transfer it to my USB
1355000	1357000	drive, then install it off the USB drive
1357000	1359000	then it had to patch
1359000	1361000	so four hours later, I'm finally in this game
1361000	1363000	and I'm playing it, and
1363000	1365000	I will say this, you know, obviously we've
1365000	1367000	razzed the game quite a bit on the show before
1367000	1369000	because it was a dreadful launch, and nothing
1369000	1371000	is ever gonna change that, it's always gonna
1371000	1373000	be looked at as one of the most
1373000	1375000	horrific, horrible launches in gaming
1375000	1377000	the question I think that's on everybody's mind
1377000	1379000	now is, is the game any better now?
1379000	1381000	and I would say the answer is, yes
1381000	1383000	actually, the game is a lot better now
1383000	1385000	it's, the combat
1385000	1387000	mode makes a lot more sense
1387000	1389000	the game itself
1389000	1391000	graphically is really good looking
1391000	1393000	just
1393000	1395000	really gorgeous looking
1395000	1397000	sceneries, and some of the cutscenes
1397000	1399000	are really good, especially in the beginning
1399000	1401000	here's where the game suffers most now
1401000	1403000	at this point, is that I think
1403000	1405000	the game's biggest problem is that
1405000	1407000	like 11, it is really
1407000	1409000	not friendly to new players
1409000	1411000	and I think they've tried to
1411000	1413000	improve the tutorial a little bit
1413000	1415000	because I sense that there's been some things added
1415000	1417000	with that, but there's still a lot of
1417000	1419000	what the hell do I do now
1419000	1421000	going on in that game? it doesn't
1421000	1423000	really quite handhold you the way
1423000	1425000	that WoW does for the first few levels
1425000	1427000	and I had to take a lot on myself
1427000	1429000	to go research wikis
1429000	1431000	and fan sites devoted to the game to figure
1431000	1433000	out like, how do I get better
1433000	1435000	armor?
1435000	1437000	or where is the damn
1437000	1439000	auction house? you know, like these are things
1439000	1441000	that the game doesn't really help you with
1441000	1443000	and I realize that a lot of people
1443000	1445000	that are gonna defend Final Fantasy 11
1445000	1447000	and Final Fantasy 14 are gonna say, well that's
1447000	1449000	part of the game, these games are not WoW
1449000	1451000	you're supposed to figure these things out, that's the challenge
1451000	1453000	and I'm here to tell you, most people aren't
1453000	1455000	gonna fucking have the patience for that
1455000	1457000	that's fine
1457000	1459000	if, you know, the select elite
1459000	1461000	smart few wanna, you know, go ahead and
1461000	1463000	be all into it or whatever
1463000	1465000	but without a significant
1465000	1467000	amount of people supporting the MMO, the MMO
1467000	1469000	is not really gonna last
1469000	1471000	I definitely notice
1471000	1473000	there's a lot less people playing this game than there was
1473000	1475000	Final Fantasy 11 when I was playing it, I noticed that
1475000	1477000	right off the bat too, the server seems
1477000	1479000	a lot more empty than 11
1479000	1481000	but to the game's credit, again
1481000	1483000	it's gorgeous, the battle system's
1483000	1485000	interesting, I like what the
1485000	1487000	I really like how they've handled
1487000	1489000	the mixture of jobs now
1489000	1491000	like if you level one class
1491000	1493000	like a conjurer and then you level another class
1493000	1495000	like a Thermaturge, you can take
1495000	1497000	the spells you've learned as a Thermaturge and apply
1497000	1499000	it to when you're a conjurer, so it's like
1499000	1501000	you're building, everything is like your own
1501000	1503000	custom class that you've built of spells
1503000	1505000	and abilities mixed together from the other classes
1505000	1507000	that's cool, I mean, so
1507000	1509000	there are things I do like
1509000	1511000	about the game and where it's going
1511000	1513000	that reminds me a little bit of
1513000	1515000	7, remember with 7 you, you know
1515000	1517000	you'd get the different spells
1517000	1519000	from the
1519000	1521000	what was it, Espers? Is that what they
1521000	1523000	called them? I don't remember
1523000	1525000	Espers or whatever and you would
1525000	1527000	apply those in there and then
1527000	1529000	you can transfer those out and learn something else
1529000	1531000	it's kind of like that and you can
1531000	1533000	basically at the end, everybody had everything
1533000	1535000	the guild levs
1535000	1537000	or the little questing thing that they put
1537000	1539000	into it, you really can
1539000	1541000	do a lot with a very limited
1541000	1543000	amount of time, like I have noticed
1543000	1545000	you can get in there, do some levs and you know
1545000	1547000	you've gained some experience and you feel like you've done
1547000	1549000	something for the day and that's kind of
1549000	1551000	nice, like that's something 11 never really had
1551000	1553000	is that you had to sit around
1553000	1555000	find a party
1555000	1557000	okay, maybe we'll gain some experience
1557000	1559000	hopefully somebody does that, I mean
1559000	1561000	even as a white mage
1561000	1563000	sometimes you'd struggle a little bit
1563000	1565000	but the nice thing is there are things you
1565000	1567000	can do by yourself and the things that
1567000	1569000	they've done, especially with the crafting
1569000	1571000	the whole fact that crafting is its own
1571000	1573000	job system with its own quest even
1573000	1575000	I thought I was
1575000	1577000	going to really hate that at first, but I realized
1577000	1579000	it gives you so much to do
1579000	1581000	playing alone
1581000	1583000	that 11 never really had, at least back in
1583000	1585000	its heyday, keep in mind my frame of reference for Final Fantasy
1585000	1587000	11 is up until about
1587000	1589000	Treasures of Aurgon, I never played after
1589000	1591000	the Wings of the Goddess, well I played a little bit
1591000	1593000	of that expansion but never the
1593000	1595000	Abyssia or any of this stuff, like level sinking
1595000	1597000	I was already gone by the time that came out, so
1597000	1599000	keep in mind my frame of reference is a few years dated
1599000	1601000	in the game
1601000	1603000	now here's the other thing, and I know you guys
1603000	1605000	are probably waiting for me to mention this because there's been a lot
1605000	1607000	of talk about this this week, Final Fantasy
1607000	1609000	14 had a lot of major announcements to it
1609000	1611000	this week, one of them being, of course
1611000	1613000	the day the game shows up in the mail
1613000	1615000	for me, what's the big announcement?
1615000	1617000	We're going to start charging monthly for this game
1617000	1619000	hahaha
1619000	1621000	alright
1621000	1623000	and then they were previewing a lot of what they plan
1623000	1625000	to do in 2.0, and granted, a lot
1625000	1627000	of it sounds really cool, it looks sexy
1627000	1629000	as far as, the screenshots look great
1629000	1631000	they're incorporating the old school
1631000	1633000	Final Fantasy more into it, which I
1633000	1635000	think is great, I really like what they've
1635000	1637000	got planned out for Final Fantasy 14
1637000	1639000	2.0, it's going to be very
1639000	1641000	interesting and almost something unprecedented in
1641000	1643000	gaming, where can this game be
1643000	1645000	rescued? And it's going to be
1645000	1647000	really interesting to see if they're successful or not
1647000	1649000	but the fact that they're
1649000	1651000	going to start charging people when the game
1651000	1653000	is admittedly halfway done
1653000	1655000	is a little weird to me, and I'm going to be honest
1655000	1657000	right now
1657000	1659000	at this moment, in my point of mind, if they were to
1659000	1661000	start charging for this game tomorrow, probably not going to
1661000	1663000	pay for it, I'll enjoy my 30 day trial
1663000	1665000	period, and then be done with it. I got a lot going
1665000	1667000	on in Warcraft and other MMOs that I play
1667000	1669000	But, and it's not even
1669000	1671000	going to be done until what, 2013?
1671000	1673000	The end of 2012 I think is when the
1673000	1675000	big, big expansion is supposed to hit. Okay, 2013
1675000	1677000	But, well, here's the other thing too
1677000	1679000	you have to remember Final Fantasy 11
1679000	1681000	it didn't come out in America at first, it was only out in
1681000	1683000	Japan, and when it came out in America
1683000	1685000	we essentially got Final Fantasy 11
1685000	1687000	2.0, because we had Rise of the Ziller
1687000	1689000	included with our release
1689000	1691000	when it came out, so it gave them time to work out the
1691000	1693000	kinks, but now that that didn't
1693000	1695000	happen this time, and everything was kind of released
1695000	1697000	at once, it does make me feel like I'm still playing
1697000	1699000	this big alpha or beta test of a game that's not
1699000	1701000	done, and now they want to charge me for it?
1701000	1703000	Like, I realize they're trying to
1703000	1705000	recoup on some massive losses
1705000	1707000	on this game, but
1707000	1709000	Not my problem. I kind of
1709000	1711000	think they're in for a rude awakening
1711000	1713000	Like,
1713000	1715000	the amount
1715000	1717000	of failure of this game
1717000	1719000	is just
1719000	1721000	whew
1721000	1723000	It is epic fail
1723000	1725000	in every sense of the term
1725000	1727000	Now, I think it's going to be really neat if the game
1727000	1729000	can salvage itself, and I gotta
1729000	1731000	be honest, a lot of what I'm seeing online
1731000	1733000	and a lot of this plan, and I
1733000	1735000	like that now they're being
1735000	1737000	open with their customer base
1737000	1739000	Now they're talking more, now they're laying out a plan
1739000	1741000	Like, I think they realize they've fucked up in a
1741000	1743000	big, big way
1743000	1745000	I mean, for the president of Square Enix to say
1745000	1747000	this game tarnished the Final Fantasy
1747000	1749000	brand, one of the biggest
1749000	1751000	and longest running franchises in gaming
1751000	1753000	history, that is like
1753000	1755000	not something to just blink at
1755000	1757000	That's huge
1757000	1759000	Especially a Japanese company to say that
1761000	1763000	So
1763000	1765000	But I think if the game
1765000	1767000	kind of keeps moving on this path
1767000	1769000	I mean, it's definitely gone in the right
1769000	1771000	direction
1771000	1773000	Real quick, sorry, I listened
1773000	1775000	I went back and listened to how I first
1775000	1777000	described my Final Fantasy XIV experience
1777000	1779000	and I called it fucking garbage
1779000	1781000	That was exactly how I reviewed this game when I played the beta
1781000	1783000	It is no longer fucking garbage
1783000	1785000	But it's not an amazing
1785000	1787000	game that I want to pay money to play
1787000	1789000	every month. It's
1789000	1791000	It's pretty good. It's alright
1791000	1793000	It's on its way. It's getting better
1793000	1795000	But, see, what's the point if, like
1795000	1797000	why would I start paying for
1797000	1799000	this game when they're like, oh, it's not
1799000	1801000	really going to be done until next November
1801000	1803000	or, you know, the end of
1803000	1805000	the next year? Okay, well fine
1805000	1807000	I'm not going to pay for it until the end of next year
1807000	1809000	That's when I'll pick it up. It's like
1809000	1811000	why even announce that and then start charging?
1811000	1813000	All you're going to do is just get people to
1813000	1815000	quit. I mean, you may get a few people
1815000	1817000	that are die hard that are just going to
1817000	1819000	I'm going to level up my characters while we're doing this and stuff
1819000	1821000	while you're working on it
1821000	1823000	But I think a lot of people that were just like
1823000	1825000	oh, well, it's free right now. I'm just not
1825000	1827000	going to pay for it. But now that they're going to start charging
1827000	1829000	I'll just wait
1829000	1831000	and play something else and then I'll come back to it
1831000	1833000	in a year or so
1833000	1835000	But at that time, who the hell
1835000	1837000	knows what Blizzard is going to have at that
1837000	1839000	time? I mean, fuck, how many more
1839000	1841000	MMOs are going to come about
1841000	1843000	by the time that they're ready to launch 2.0
1843000	1845000	It's not going to matter
1845000	1847000	And a really good one is going free to play
1847000	1849000	And we've got
1849000	1851000	Swartar on the horizon
1851000	1853000	at the end of December. We've got
1853000	1855000	Guild Wars 2 next year that has a lot of people
1855000	1857000	riled up. There will
1857000	1859000	be a WoW expansion. By that point
1859000	1861000	Blizzard will have announced their next
1861000	1863000	MMO
1863000	1865000	Yeah, you're right. It's getting a little crowded in the MMO space
1865000	1867000	I think what's going to end up happening is it's just going to go
1867000	1869000	free to play. It's got to. I mean,
1869000	1871000	that's the trend right now and a lot of these
1871000	1873000	suffering MMOs end up going that way
1873000	1875000	But then again, they're Square Enix and they're fucking
1875000	1877000	stubborn, so maybe just
1877000	1879000	let it rot and die
1879000	1881000	I would love to read
1881000	1883000	a behind the scenes book on Final
1883000	1885000	Fantasy XIV. Like, this is a
1885000	1887000	this is a game for
1887000	1889000	better or for worse, this is a game that will go down in history
1889000	1891000	Absolutely. Absolutely.
1891000	1893000	And we're watching it unfold right now
1893000	1895000	Alright, let's move on
1895000	1897000	to some quick housekeeping

1919000	1921000	which was 2005 and
1921000	1923000	Dark Sakura now has her duffy hat
1923000	1925000	sitting on the trophy. Yes, I do.
1925000	1927000	I'll take a picture.
1927000	1929000	Yeah, we've got that and
1929000	1931000	we would be honored to win it again
1931000	1933000	but there are a lot of great shows
1933000	1935000	in the finals but the promotion
1935000	1937000	that we could get for winning would be
1937000	1939000	great and as you know
1939000	1941000	we don't have a lot of big dollars
1941000	1943000	or ways to advertise our program
1943000	1945000	We don't have any big dollars. Yeah, actually
1945000	1947000	we have no money whatsoever so we really
1947000	1949000	rely on word of mouth as we say at the end of every show
1949000	1951000	so please, please, please take
1951000	1953000	a moment to go vote for us in the podcast
1953000	1955000	awards and don't forget you can
1955000	1957000	vote every day between now and the
1957000	1959000	24th? 27th.
1959000	1961000	27th, thank you. And the winners
1961000	1963000	will be announced what, early November probably.
1963000	1965000	I don't think there's actually an award
1965000	1967000	ceremony this time though. I remember the first year
1967000	1969000	Dark Sakura went to an award ceremony where she sat
1969000	1971000	behind him. I was so sick too.
1971000	1973000	But um,
1973000	1975000	yeah, we would be honored to win again
1975000	1977000	and it would be pretty cool. I think we would be the only show
1977000	1979000	to have won the award like what, six years apart?
1979000	1981000	But, you know,
1981000	1983000	it's been an honor just to be
1983000	1985000	nominated. Alright.
1985000	1987000	That being said, we fucking
1987000	1989000	want to win. And also on
1989000	1991000	Facebook you can check out
1991000	1993000	we've got a little banner
1993000	1995000	art thing that you can put in your signature
1995000	1997000	on whatever forms
1997000	1999000	you happen to visit and stuff to help
1999000	2001000	promote, you know, voting.
2001000	2003000	Don't, don't spam people, but
2003000	2005000	at the same time, like, please, people you know
2005000	2007000	like, tell them, like, we, we really
2007000	2009000	do need every vote because
2009000	2011000	every show, and you probably,
2011000	2013000	you probably have a couple of the podcasts that are finalists
2013000	2015000	in your listening rotation, as you should.
2015000	2017000	There's a lot of great shows that were nominated.
2017000	2019000	Um, and there, you're probably gonna be hearing
2019000	2021000	this to death throughout the next couple weeks.
2021000	2023000	But, you know, it's, it's really
2023000	2025000	um, promotion from winning
2025000	2027000	it can't be beat. So,
2027000	2029000	it'd be great. Alright, uh,
2029000	2031000	let's move on and talk about the
2031000	2033000	gaming news. So,
2033000	2035000	Loki, why don't you start us off.
2035000	2037000	Um, of course you know there's a new fall
2037000	2039000	dashboard update coming to the Xbox 360
2039000	2041000	to kind of make it look a little bit like, uh,
2041000	2043000	Windows 8 or, um, you know,
2043000	2045000	the Windows phone and that kind of stuff. Personally
2045000	2047000	I think it looks stupid, but, you know, whatever, that's
2047000	2049000	I don't really have a say in it. I got an
2049000	2051000	update, you know, on the 25th of November
2051000	2053000	when this actually goes live.
2053000	2055000	Apparently it's gonna be using a modified
2055000	2057000	version of Silverlight
2057000	2059000	if you care to know how it works.
2059000	2061000	Honestly, I don't really
2061000	2063000	care myself, but it's supposed
2063000	2065000	to, you know, do a lot of integration. Obviously
2065000	2067000	they're gonna have, you know, more Kinect support
2067000	2069000	and, um, you know, the live TV
2069000	2071000	stuff. Also, you're gonna be able to
2071000	2073000	do the, um,
2073000	2075000	you know, the, uh,
2075000	2077000	Bing searches and all
2077000	2079000	sorts of stuff to find different content on there.
2079000	2081000	And, um, I believe there is also
2081000	2083000	a, uh,
2083000	2085000	if you wanted to, I decided to
2085000	2087000	opt out of it this year. Um,
2087000	2089000	a beta participation to,
2089000	2091000	you know, test the dashboard early.
2091000	2093000	Uh, honestly wasn't a big fan of
2093000	2095000	having to update twice a day every single
2095000	2097000	day until the launch of the actual dashboard, so
2097000	2099000	I passed on that.
2099000	2101000	But, uh, that was available shortly
2101000	2103000	and I believe, uh, the
2103000	2105000	submission, uh, for the beta program
2105000	2107000	has been closed already. And,
2107000	2109000	um, yeah.
2109000	2111000	And of course, you know, for those keeping
2111000	2113000	track, 25th also is Black Friday.
2113000	2115000	So.
2115000	2117000	Busy, busy, busy.
2117000	2119000	Oh my gosh, that's rolling out on Black Friday?
2119000	2121000	Yup. That's a recipe
2121000	2123000	for disaster.
2123000	2125000	Maybe. That sucks for those employees.
2125000	2127000	Cause you know Microsoft's gotta be fully
2127000	2129000	staffed for a day that something like that goes live.
2129000	2131000	They'll have to work on Black Friday.
2131000	2133000	Well, they will at least have
2133000	2135000	their stomach full of turkey.
2135000	2137000	And, uh, they will be, uh,
2137000	2139000	be ready to take those. Loki always looking
2139000	2141000	at the bright side. You know what,
2141000	2143000	you know what an awesome thing to do is on Black Friday?
2143000	2145000	Go to a theme park.
2145000	2147000	Cause they're empty. I don't know about Disneyland.
2147000	2149000	Disneyland's always kind of the exception of the rule, but I will say, like,
2149000	2151000	I went to Magic Mountain a couple years ago, it was empty
2151000	2153000	on Black Friday. Black Friday and Super Bowl Sunday.
2153000	2155000	Best days to do that stuff.
2155000	2157000	Anyway.
2157000	2159000	Uh, as far as the fall dashboard goes, are you
2159000	2161000	excited for this? No. That's about to roll. No?
2161000	2163000	No, I hate the way it looks. You don't like
2163000	2165000	it? I, I dislike it.
2165000	2167000	Windows 8, you know what, when that comes
2167000	2169000	out, I am fucking turning this shit off.
2169000	2171000	So it looks like back, you know, back to
2171000	2173000	Windows 7, 95
2173000	2175000	XP, whatever you want to call it.
2175000	2177000	You know, I don't like this crappy,
2177000	2179000	oh look at all these panes of information.
2179000	2181000	Yeah, you know what panes of information are?
2181000	2183000	It's more advertising space.
2183000	2185000	That's all this fucking is. And I
2185000	2187000	don't care about the ads that are on there already.
2187000	2189000	So why would I want to see more of them?
2189000	2191000	There are things I like and things I
2191000	2193000	don't like. Um, but as far as the
2193000	2195000	dashboard goes, I, I, I
2195000	2197000	have not been a fan of NXC
2197000	2199000	or whatever this current one we're on is called.
2199000	2201000	I just, I hate the way it's laid out.
2201000	2203000	And I like the fact that this new one is
2203000	2205000	going to have all the searching built into it for
2205000	2207000	like, hopefully it works for like options
2207000	2209000	and things like that too. Like, change
2209000	2211000	my gamer pic. I hope I can
2211000	2213000	yell that at my Kinect and it'll understand me.
2213000	2215000	Um, because like honestly
2215000	2217000	part of the NXC and part of the frustrating
2217000	2219000	stuff in that is that you
2219000	2221000	sometimes like honestly can't find
2221000	2223000	the one simple thing you're trying to change in your settings
2223000	2225000	because they're like all over the place. So
2225000	2227000	hopefully this has that a little more
2227000	2229000	streamlined. But as far as like being like a
2229000	2231000	streamlined entertainment box,
2231000	2233000	well shit, that's where they're all going now anyway.
2233000	2235000	But I think the next, the next
2235000	2237000	generation of consoles, just
2237000	2239000	you wait how streamlined
2239000	2241000	those things are going to be with your other
2241000	2243000	entertainment stuff. You know, but see, I'm, I'm cool
2243000	2245000	with the fact that they're going to have content on there
2245000	2247000	and I would, I would like to
2247000	2249000	believe that it's going to be free, but I don't like the fact
2249000	2251000	that it's tied in with like my cable provider
2251000	2253000	because I mean granted
2253000	2255000	right now with Comcast I have the most basic
2255000	2257000	basic basic cable possible. I don't
2257000	2259000	think I even have on demand or anything like
2259000	2261000	that, but I don't want
2261000	2263000	to have to have Comcast cable
2263000	2265000	in order to access, I mean I would love to get rid of
2265000	2267000	cable period. Keep the
2267000	2269000	internet of course, but and just have
2269000	2271000	access to this stuff.
2271000	2273000	Maybe not necessarily the stuff that's on
2273000	2275000	Comcast because if I want to watch on demand
2275000	2277000	Comcast stuff, I'll just
2277000	2279000	go to Comcast
2279000	2281000	and watch on demand. I mean there's a ton of
2281000	2283000	different ways to do that. I don't need to actually
2283000	2285000	hook up my console to do the same thing you're going to do on my
2285000	2287000	TV. It just doesn't make any sense.
2289000	2291000	I've actually really given thought to just cutting
2291000	2293000	my cable loose because I just,
2293000	2295000	I barely watch any TV.
2295000	2297000	Ours is linked to our internet so
2297000	2299000	Well yeah, so is ours, but I mean
2299000	2301000	still if we could even save 20 bucks a month
2301000	2303000	shutting it off. That's the thing though is as we did that
2303000	2305000	we cut out phone and we also cut out
2305000	2307000	cable, well we were going to
2307000	2309000	cut out cable and just keep the internet, but they had a plan
2309000	2311000	that was $2 more for cable.
2311000	2313000	It included, so I was like okay fine
2313000	2315000	we'll do cable too. It's a good thing
2315000	2317000	too because my plan was, oh I'm just going to get one of
2317000	2319000	those antennas and hook it up. Yeah I bought one of those
2319000	2321000	antennas last night, they fucking suck.
2321000	2323000	They do not tune in shit. And so
2323000	2325000	I got nothing and the only time I did get to
2325000	2327000	tune in the channel it was so messed up.
2327000	2329000	When you have cable internet you kind of have to
2329000	2331000	have at least basic cable, right?
2331000	2333000	I don't think any of the companies will sell you.
2333000	2335000	No, you can get just the internet.
2335000	2337000	Really? I always thought you had to have at least
2337000	2339000	It's more expensive, but
2339000	2341000	Like local channels plus CNN, bare minimum.
2341000	2343000	No, you don't have to, but
2343000	2345000	like I said there is a deal that they have right now
2345000	2347000	and you can get it for I think
2347000	2349000	they gave it to us for about $2
2349000	2351000	more a month and I was like
2351000	2353000	you know what I can do that and
2353000	2355000	since Comcast doesn't have any
2355000	2357000	contracts it's like well fuck at the end
2357000	2359000	of the year just cancel so
2359000	2361000	or at the end of one year it's time
2361000	2363000	we can just cancel so who cares.
2363000	2365000	Ron's 006 in our chatroom at
2365000	2367000	chat.orangestop.com says they know
2367000	2369000	people don't want cable much and so
2369000	2371000	they will bundle it to force people to buy cable
2371000	2373000	to get internet. Yeah, I think that's exactly
2373000	2375000	what's happening.
2375000	2377000	I'm sure these companies know. Well all they're doing is
2377000	2379000	raising the prices of, you watch
2379000	2381000	they're going to start raising the prices of a lot of
2381000	2383000	internet. Alright, well let's
2383000	2385000	move on to some other gaming related stories and
2385000	2387000	speaking of rising prices
2387000	2389000	these next little few stories
2389000	2391000	have to do with the online pass. Yes, that's
2391000	2393000	right. What once was Project
2393000	2395000	$10 is now becoming the standard
2395000	2397000	and if you don't believe me look at what they're doing in some
2397000	2399000	big releases coming out.
2399000	2401000	Catwoman in Batman Arkham
2401000	2403000	City, obviously this is a huge release
2403000	2405000	that's out, what, this week? Is this week?
2405000	2407000	Tuesday. Tuesday.
2407000	2409000	It's actually on my friend's birthday. Big week.
2409000	2411000	Well Arkham City is coming out and
2411000	2413000	here's the deal, if you want to play as Catwoman
2413000	2415000	you need to have an online pass.
2415000	2417000	One of them will come with
2417000	2419000	the game of course and you buy it new
2419000	2421000	that's the whole deal is that you always do get it
2421000	2423000	included new but if you end up
2423000	2425000	buying the game used you will have to
2425000	2427000	purchase the VIP pass for
2427000	2429000	800 Microsoft points or
2429000	2431000	$9.99 on PlayStation Network so
2431000	2433000	you know 10 bucks or however you slice it there.
2433000	2435000	They are quick to say that
2435000	2437000	playing as Catwoman is not required
2437000	2439000	to complete the game but
2439000	2441000	come on we all want to see Catwoman in
2441000	2443000	that outfit. Not entirely true.
2443000	2445000	Well there's more, hold on, hold on.
2445000	2447000	There is something else going on there too
2447000	2449000	and that is a deal with
2449000	2451000	a company called
2451000	2453000	the Evil G
2453000	2455000	which is a major major major
2455000	2457000	gaming retailer in America.
2457000	2459000	Yes. We call the Evil G
2459000	2461000	and apparently there is an agreement
2461000	2463000	with Evil G where
2463000	2465000	supposedly, this is an internal memo
2465000	2467000	that all customers that will purchase
2467000	2469000	the game used there
2469000	2471000	will be given a free code that will be
2471000	2473000	on the receipt. So
2473000	2475000	in other words Project $10
2475000	2477000	won't apply if you buy the game
2477000	2479000	used at this one retailer
2479000	2481000	who has their hand
2481000	2483000	firmly on the balls of all gaming
2483000	2485000	publishers around the world. I bet you
2485000	2487000	you're going to see there's a lot more titles because they have
2487000	2489000	they have the strength and buying power
2489000	2491000	to say listen bitches you're going to
2491000	2493000	give us codes for all these games.
2493000	2495000	And that's how they're going to get around it.
2495000	2497000	Does that hurt?
2497000	2499000	Everybody else.
2499000	2501000	Or if you're like me
2501000	2503000	who gives a fuck
2503000	2505000	about Catwoman. But here's the gross part about it.
2505000	2507000	It's already on the god damn
2507000	2509000	disk. It's just locked away behind
2509000	2511000	a code because they're assholes
2511000	2513000	is what it is. So you know what?
2513000	2515000	Fuck them. Don't buy the game.
2515000	2517000	Either don't buy the game
2517000	2519000	or just don't fucking play as Catwoman.
2519000	2521000	Who gives a shit? Tigerclaw in the chat
2521000	2523000	room points out there are Riddler trophies
2523000	2525000	that you can only get with Catwoman. Exactly.
2525000	2527000	That was the part I was going to bring up.
2527000	2529000	Yeah. So if you want 100% complete.
2529000	2531000	You gotta play as Catwoman.
2531000	2533000	Now granted if you buy the game
2533000	2535000	new you're not losing any of this.
2535000	2537000	You're not going to lose it. It's that but
2537000	2539000	you know this is just
2539000	2541000	that trend and by the
2541000	2543000	way speaking of trend
2543000	2545000	Electronic Arts
2545000	2547000	mentioned this week that Battlefield 3
2547000	2549000	will also have an online pass.
2549000	2551000	Battlefield 3 kind of a big game coming
2551000	2553000	out pretty soon. Just a little
2553000	2555000	title you might have heard of it. Battlefield 3
2555000	2557000	right? And this was all confirmed on
2557000	2559000	Twitter.
2559000	2561000	A user tweeted a guy working
2561000	2563000	for EA. Do you need to buy a
2563000	2565000	new Battlefield 3 to pay on Xbox
2565000	2567000	Live? And the response was you can
2567000	2569000	purchase an online pass for a used
2569000	2571000	copy. So I mean as if it wasn't
2571000	2573000	confirmed that this shit is now the norm.
2573000	2575000	And it's the first game that they've done
2575000	2577000	that it's not a sports game either.
2577000	2579000	Oh. I did not pick up on
2579000	2581000	that so. And
2581000	2583000	obviously going to be a huge huge
2583000	2585000	title no matter how you slice it. Yeah. I'm not surprised
2585000	2587000	and I think that mainly is just to stop
2587000	2589000	piracy because it's going to be a big game
2589000	2591000	that's going to be pirated. It's also and to be fair
2591000	2593000	you know for what it's worth this is also going to be
2593000	2595000	a big title because you're going to have
2595000	2597000	tons of people who buy it new
2597000	2599000	and they will not this will all be
2599000	2601000	transparent to them it won't matter they get the code with
2601000	2603000	the game. So
2603000	2605000	it's only for those people that are waiting to save a few
2605000	2607000	bucks by buying a used copy that won't really
2607000	2609000	be saving any money. Well just wait a little longer and I'm sure
2609000	2611000	by then GameStop will have the code for
2611000	2613000	you for free you know.
2613000	2617000	Because they've worked out some sort of deal.
2617000	2619000	All right. Shadownext
2619000	2621000	in chat says buy a game new and support
2621000	2623000	the industry if you do that the online passcodes
2623000	2625000	are not an issue. I'm sorry once again
2625000	2627000	yeah I understand buying new and stuff it
2627000	2629000	supports the industry and stuff and I hear
2629000	2631000	people saying well if you buy used
2631000	2633000	the developer doesn't get any money
2633000	2635000	listen you stupid idiots
2635000	2637000	okay. The developer gets paid
2637000	2639000	when they fucking press the goddamn disc
2639000	2641000	it can sit on a goddamn warehouse shelf
2641000	2643000	in EA, Activision, you name it
2643000	2645000	and the developer is still getting
2645000	2647000	fucking paid for that shit. So the
2647000	2649000	fact that they're complaining that
2649000	2651000	we didn't sell another
2651000	2653000	new copy now our servers
2653000	2655000	gonna go down because we have less people
2655000	2657000	paying for it. No listen there's
2657000	2659000	exactly the same amount of people playing on those goddamn
2659000	2661000	servers as new copies that were sold.
2661000	2663000	You can't magically create two copies
2663000	2665000	out of one without you know some sort
2665000	2667000	of piracy. So I'm just so
2667000	2669000	and I think we all agree that
2669000	2671000	piracy is a no no. Yeah piracy
2671000	2673000	is bad but that is really the only thing
2673000	2675000	I'm sorry used games do not eat
2675000	2677000	into that.
2677000	2679000	It's just it's so stupid.
2679000	2681000	I'm with you and I'm not.
2681000	2683000	Here's my whole thing and again it's
2683000	2685000	the movie industry and I think what's good enough for the movie
2685000	2687000	industry is good enough for gaming and the movie industry
2687000	2689000	hasn't like died because of used games.
2689000	2691000	And you know there's always gonna
2691000	2693000	be game rental services and things like this
2693000	2695000	and I think there's just there's enough people
2695000	2697000	that want these games new the day they
2697000	2699000	come out. Yeah but see there's a lot of stuff
2699000	2701000	you don't understand preordered Skyrim
2701000	2703000	you know there's a lot of things that you don't
2703000	2705000	know about the movie industry too. They don't like
2705000	2707000	used product. In fact red box used
2707000	2709000	to have to you know they used
2709000	2711000	to sell off their used movies when they were done
2711000	2713000	renting them and then you know those would get
2713000	2715000	in turn sold to stores or whatever to
2715000	2717000	be bought. And now through the
2717000	2719000	exclusive deals in order to get the product into
2719000	2721000	those machines even though a lot of them are really terrible
2721000	2723000	deals they have to destroy all that product
2723000	2725000	because they're afraid of the used sales
2725000	2727000	eating into their new sales. And the same thing actually
2727000	2729000	happened with the original runs of Hummers.
2729000	2731000	It's just like... No seriously
2731000	2733000	not the Hummers but the Humvees through the military
2733000	2735000	the first run of them you could
2735000	2737000	convert them into Hummers for sale.
2737000	2739000	Wow. But then they actually
2739000	2741000	when they decommissioned them they had to destroy them.
2741000	2743000	So that they wouldn't be sold.
2743000	2745000	Same thing goes with
2745000	2747000	Warner Brothers for example Warner Brothers
2747000	2749000	they just instilled a 60 day
2749000	2751000	rental window on all titles.
2751000	2753000	That's for everybody.
2753000	2755000	You know before they used to have it
2755000	2757000	where it was just Redbox
2757000	2759000	and stuff now it's everybody and I heard
2759000	2761000	something I think they may even do at some
2761000	2763000	point it's going to be six months once
2763000	2765000	the rumors is going to be
2765000	2767000	turned into six months once
2767000	2769000	all these contracts are up.
2769000	2771000	Yeah they hate
2771000	2773000	the used industry but they're the only ones
2773000	2775000	so far that are kind of going to the
2775000	2777000	extreme. But once
2777000	2779000	again though I'm sorry I don't
2779000	2781000	yeah I understand that people
2781000	2783000	buying used or whatever
2783000	2785000	are going to be
2785000	2787000	affecting the amount of new copies that a store
2787000	2789000	brings in because if you have like 60 used
2789000	2791000	copies you're not going to be bringing in a lot of
2791000	2793000	new copies and so yes that would eat at your
2793000	2795000	bottom line a little bit. But
2795000	2797000	the people that sell back those used copies
2797000	2799000	take that money to buy new fucking
2799000	2801000	games that you may be producing.
2801000	2803000	So the fact that you're just
2803000	2805000	stopping people from buying new games
2805000	2807000	there's only a finite
2807000	2809000	amount of money these gamers are going to have
2809000	2811000	and if you're taking away that avenue for them
2811000	2813000	to sell it back used and
2813000	2815000	trade in to get a new game that you might be
2815000	2817000	making so that you can get your fucking commission
2817000	2819000	check then people are going to
2819000	2821000	buy less games overall so
2821000	2823000	you're just hurting yourselves. That's really all it's
2823000	2825000	going to end up being. I guess
2825000	2827000	at the end of the day most of the
2827000	2829000	games I buy I buy new so it really
2829000	2831000	doesn't end up affecting me but she kind of
2831000	2833000	can't help but go
2833000	2835000	they're going to make a buck wherever they can.
2835000	2837000	But am myself directly
2837000	2839000	is this going to change my game buying habits?
2839000	2841000	Probably not. But I will
2841000	2843000	say that there's like I kind of
2843000	2845000	noticed that this year I really am cutting
2845000	2847000	back and maybe it's just the economy or what have you
2847000	2849000	I really am kind of cutting back on
2849000	2851000	the games I plan on buying new. Like
2851000	2853000	I go back a couple years and
2853000	2855000	there you know I probably would have bought a lot of games
2855000	2857000	over the holiday
2857000	2859000	season but this year I really can't
2859000	2861000	think of a lot that I'm going to buy. I'm not even sure
2861000	2863000	I'm going to buy Dance Central 2.
2863000	2865000	Like because I'm really questioning like am I really
2865000	2867000	going to play it that much? Probably not.
2867000	2869000	So I'm only buying those games
2869000	2871000	I know I'm going to play a lot.
2871000	2873000	And that would be Skyrim
2873000	2875000	this year. Final Fantasy 13 2
2875000	2877000	next year. You know kind of a lot
2877000	2879000	of the big RPGs.
2879000	2881000	So I don't know.
2881000	2883000	Saints Row the Third.
2883000	2885000	That will probably have enough. See that's one of those
2885000	2887000	games where I might want to check it out used.
2887000	2889000	That will have a pass I'm sure but here's the best
2889000	2891000	part about Saints Row the Third.
2891000	2893000	Welcome they've got system link. I don't need to go
2893000	2895000	on your fucking internets.
2895000	2897000	I'll just play it local.
2897000	2899000	I don't need your internets.
2899000	2901000	Alright let's move on we've got lots more stories to tackle
2901000	2903000	Dark Saga.
2903000	2905000	There's actually something on my oh there we go.
2905000	2907000	Something on my microphone.
2907000	2909000	How about Wii stuff? The new
2909000	2911000	Wii bundle. Wii!
2911000	2913000	It's going to have new Super Mario Brothers
2913000	2915000	but it's going to lose something very important
2915000	2917000	to a lot of people. GameCube support.
2917000	2919000	No more GameCube. Sorry.
2919000	2921000	We're pulling a Playstation.
2921000	2923000	So this is like our version
2923000	2925000	of what Europe got
2925000	2927000	at the Gamescom or whatever right?
2927000	2929000	Pretty much.
2929000	2931000	It is going to have though
2931000	2933000	actually the system itself
2933000	2935000	is black.
2935000	2937000	It has a black Wiimote Plus
2937000	2939000	and a nunchuck and
2939000	2941000	a Super Mario Galaxy soundtrack.
2941000	2943000	And it's going to be out on October
2943000	2945000	23rd for $150 bucks.
2945000	2947000	Isn't $150 bucks
2947000	2949000	what a Wii cost right now?
2949000	2951000	Yes it is.
2951000	2953000	Alright. And they say that
2953000	2955000	the Mario Kart bundle is going to
2955000	2957000	still be available along with the new one.
2957000	2959000	Is that true Loki?
2959000	2961000	You're like half shaking
2961000	2963000	half not. Yes it's true.
2963000	2965000	I think they're going to sell the old ones until they run out of stock.
2965000	2967000	I'm not doubting what Dark
2967000	2969000	Sakura is saying but I'm like okay really? Is that really
2969000	2971000	the long term plan? Is that really?
2971000	2973000	Dan and I back in the day
2973000	2975000	went through the entire
2975000	2977000	supply of
2977000	2979000	PlayStations, DualShock Systems
2979000	2981000	at KB Toys
2981000	2983000	by where I worked
2983000	2985000	so that we could find the one with the port in the back
2985000	2987000	because our old one was dying.
2987000	2989000	People are that anal
2989000	2991000	and will try to find the ones
2991000	2993000	that have got what they want in it.
2993000	2995000	People still want a Playstation 3 that will play PS2 games.
2995000	2997000	I've got one. I have one
2997000	2999000	that will play PS1.
2999000	3001000	Well they all play PS1. I know but mine will play PS1
3001000	3003000	PS2. It's
3003000	3005000	the whole thing.
3005000	3007000	Which one of the games I didn't mention I played this week
3007000	3009000	I actually put in old school PS1
3009000	3011000	games on my Playstation 3.
3011000	3013000	One of the random games I played this week was like
3013000	3015000	the 30 Activision game collection.
3015000	3017000	Oh my god. Like going back and
3017000	3019000	playing it now I'm like god this is some sloppy
3019000	3021000	ass packaging and like what are these like
3021000	3023000	LSD influenced title menu graphics?
3023000	3025000	Like I can't even. You know what
3025000	3027000	I've had the urge to go back and play? What?
3027000	3029000	Jumping Flash. Like
3029000	3031000	plug it in and go play it like in the front room.
3031000	3033000	Awesome. And give myself a seizure.
3033000	3035000	But yeah. So
3035000	3037000	people will
3037000	3039000	they want the old one look at the old one. They don't care
3039000	3041000	then. I mean it really doesn't matter to me
3041000	3043000	I've got a GameCube. But
3043000	3045000	it's nice you know having it all in one.
3045000	3047000	I hope at this point
3047000	3049000	everybody who is interested in this
3049000	3051000	kinda already got
3051000	3053000	a Wii. Like I can't imagine there's gonna be
3053000	3055000	lots of people that are like left out in the cold
3055000	3057000	so to speak.
3057000	3059000	But it's still weird
3059000	3061000	like the math behind it is what's weird
3061000	3063000	to me. If it's cheaper it'd make like
3063000	3065000	$129 or something or $125.
3065000	3067000	Even a $20
3067000	3069000	cut in the price tag would have
3069000	3071000	helped you know like make this
3071000	3073000	make sense. Or like
3073000	3075000	new Super Mario Brothers and maybe
3075000	3077000	like Super Mario All-Stars or
3077000	3079000	something like that. You know that limited run game or something.
3079000	3081000	Well there's a little bit more and actually this is
3081000	3083000	for Europe specifically.
3083000	3085000	In November there's gonna be a bundle
3085000	3087000	that's Mario and Sonic at the London 2012
3087000	3089000	Olympic Games and it's
3089000	3091000	blue. But it's the same
3091000	3093000	GameCube free
3093000	3095000	edition.
3095000	3097000	The horizontal. The vertically challenged
3097000	3099000	Wii. Yeah. Essentially.
3099000	3101000	The
3101000	3103000	Wii.
3103000	3105000	The not so Wii. I just I don't
3105000	3107000	understand
3107000	3109000	it's the PSP Go again.
3109000	3111000	It's like hey we got this new
3111000	3113000	system that's coming out and it's got less
3113000	3115000	feature. No it's not that bad. It's not that bad.
3115000	3117000	Again I think most people
3117000	3119000	that give a hoot about GameCube compatibility
3119000	3121000	already got one. Like
3121000	3123000	but still the math just doesn't
3123000	3125000	make sense. If you're a gamer
3125000	3127000	they're literally cutting it out for no
3127000	3129000	reason than maybe they plan to sell
3129000	3131000	the games on the Wii U.
3131000	3133000	Which I'm sure is the that's really
3133000	3135000	the long term thing we're looking at.
3135000	3137000	That's why they're cutting it now. Because they know on the Wii U
3137000	3139000	they want to sell the GameCube games. Just wait.
3139000	3141000	Just wait. Oh it's gonna happen.
3141000	3143000	But
3143000	3145000	it's still though. I mean if you're looking for
3145000	3147000	you could probably just get the Mario
3147000	3149000	Car thing. And hell I'm sure you could probably
3149000	3151000	if you really didn't want Mario
3151000	3153000	Car you could probably trade it in someplace and
3153000	3155000	get New Super Mario Brothers. I mean
3155000	3157000	I'm sure a lot of stores have it. It's
3157000	3159000	a popular game and I'm sure
3159000	3161000	a lot of people have traded it in. But
3161000	3163000	just
3163000	3165000	I don't understand.
3165000	3167000	You might need the GameCube controller for something else
3167000	3169000	later on. Here's a
3169000	3171000	crazy random question. Do you think these new
3171000	3173000	Wii's are being done to combat a lot of
3173000	3175000	the modding that people are doing to their Wii's?
3175000	3177000	I think so. Because I think a lot of that modding
3177000	3179000	stuff runs off of files
3179000	3181000	that were part of the GameCube.
3181000	3183000	Like the Dole files or
3183000	3185000	whatever. Now
3185000	3187000	I'm understanding why
3187000	3189000	they just are slowly taking that out. Like
3189000	3191000	if that's part of it. That
3191000	3193000	makes a lot more sense now why they've removed it.
3193000	3195000	It's akin to
3195000	3197000	PlayStation 3 deleting the other OS
3197000	3199000	support but without all the hubbub. Because
3199000	3201000	you know
3201000	3203000	this is a physical thing. Nintendo can't
3203000	3205000	come to my house and take the GameCube compatibility
3205000	3207000	out of my existing Wii.
3207000	3209000	Yeah. Or they couldn't but that wouldn't be
3209000	3211000	good for them. Yeah. Not a good idea.
3211000	3213000	That would require
3213000	3215000	releasing
3215000	3217000	like an online patch which
3217000	3219000	Wii is very limited in what they're able to do.
3219000	3221000	Yeah.
3221000	3223000	Alright. Anyhow. Let's move on
3223000	3225000	with some more news, Loki.
3225000	3227000	So they're gonna have some new
3227000	3229000	as you may remember the Halo
3229000	3231000	HD remake. The Halo
3231000	3233000	Combat Evolved Anniversary Edition.
3233000	3235000	They're gonna be doing some sort of
3235000	3237000	like. Oh I'm sorry.
3237000	3239000	I'm reading the wrong story. Stupid me.
3239000	3241000	I was like what the hell are you doing Loki?
3241000	3243000	Let's talk a little bit about
3243000	3245000	the PlayStation Network.
3245000	3247000	The OLR host compatibility has been
3247000	3249000	removed out of Loki in the most recent
3249000	3251000	upgrade apparently. Yes. Exactly.
3251000	3253000	So there's
3253000	3255000	not really
3255000	3257000	the PlayStation Network hasn't really been compromised
3257000	3259000	but some of the data or
3259000	3261000	whatever that was grabbed from
3261000	3263000	the PlayStation Network the last time
3263000	3265000	has been used to try to compromise
3265000	3267000	the PlayStation Network again I guess.
3267000	3269000	So basically a lot of user accounts
3269000	3271000	I wanna say it was like 75,000
3271000	3273000	or something like that
3273000	3275000	were locked out because
3275000	3277000	people have been trying to attempt
3277000	3279000	or attempting to sign in using
3279000	3281000	login and password information that were
3281000	3283000	obtained of one or
3283000	3285000	more compromised lists
3285000	3287000	from other companies sites or sources
3287000	3289000	so I guess they're like trying
3289000	3291000	to login using your
3291000	3293000	Hotmail, Google or whatever
3293000	3295000	sites happened to leak
3295000	3297000	out some information
3297000	3299000	and I'm wondering if maybe that has
3299000	3301000	something to do with also
3301000	3303000	the Xbox Live users
3303000	3305000	which we're still getting a lot more of those now
3305000	3307000	finally being reported.
3307000	3309000	Much like
3309000	3311000	Sky had a problem with
3311000	3313000	people breaking into his account
3313000	3315000	and spending money on FIFA shit
3315000	3317000	there's been a lot more people
3317000	3319000	talking about it and
3319000	3321000	Thank you Gaming Press for covering this a month
3321000	3323000	after it was news. Yes
3323000	3325000	Ars Technica actually started
3325000	3327000	reporting a lot of people
3327000	3329000	actually
3329000	3331000	telling them that say hey
3331000	3333000	my game account was hacked and
3333000	3335000	they bought
3335000	3337000	FIFA 11 and also
3337000	3339000	the Gold Pass or whatever
3339000	3341000	spent $100 on my account
3341000	3343000	and there's been a lot of
3343000	3345000	other things people are starting to see
3345000	3347000	FIFA 12 and
3347000	3349000	purchases are kind of related to that
3349000	3351000	and
3351000	3353000	of course sure enough
3353000	3355000	all of my Microsoft points that were stored on my
3355000	3357000	Xbox Live account had been spent on
3357000	3359000	in game items for FIFA 11
3359000	3361000	I don't own that game, hell I don't even like
3361000	3363000	soccer games and whoever spent
3363000	3365000	my Microsoft points had tried to purchase more
3365000	3367000	presumably when the purchase failed
3367000	3369000	they abandoned my account and went to steal from some
3369000	3371000	other unsuspecting gamer
3371000	3373000	and yeah I think that's kind of the case so
3373000	3375000	of course you know change passwords
3375000	3377000	hopefully that's enough
3377000	3379000	and of course Microsoft
3379000	3381000	when pressed for a statement
3381000	3383000	they were saying we do not have any evidence
3383000	3385000	of the Xbox Live
3385000	3387000	service that has been compromised
3387000	3389000	we take our security of our
3389000	3391000	service seriously and work on an ongoing
3391000	3393000	basis to improve it against
3393000	3395000	any evolving threats
3395000	3397000	however a limited number of members have contacted us
3397000	3399000	regarding unauthorized access to
3399000	3401000	their accounts by outside individuals
3401000	3403000	we are working with our impacted members
3403000	3405000	directly to resolve any unauthorized
3405000	3407000	charges to their
3407000	3409000	accounts as always we highly recommend
3409000	3411000	our members follow the Xbox Live
3411000	3413000	account security guidance provided
3413000	3415000	at Xbox.com slash security
3415000	3417000	What a lovely sanitized response
3417000	3419000	from the Xbox media relations
3419000	3421000	department what a lovely
3421000	3423000	sanitized response because some
3423000	3425000	could mean a million
3425000	3427000	I mean I get it Microsoft does not
3427000	3429000	want to panic on their hands like what Sony had to
3429000	3431000	go through but you know they're trying to
3431000	3433000	poo poo this and make it sound like it's not that many people
3433000	3435000	when I've known at least
3435000	3437000	at least 12 people that this has happened to
3437000	3439000	And you just read the comments and like
3439000	3441000	Do you know how many people I've known that have had their PlayStation accounts hacked?
3441000	3443000	Zero
3443000	3445000	And I mean hacked for like money
3445000	3447000	or false charges
3447000	3449000	And you know on this story there's
3449000	3451000	109 comments and a lot of them
3451000	3453000	are saying
3453000	3455000	yeah hey are any
3455000	3457000	let's see here
3457000	3459000	um
3459000	3461000	where we go here
3461000	3463000	my account was hacked yesterday I'm getting the standard
3463000	3465000	25 day lockout treatment I'm also
3465000	3467000	disputing the charges on my
3467000	3469000	credit card
3469000	3471000	see here on July
3471000	3473000	10th the same thing happened to me
3473000	3475000	um
3475000	3477000	let's see here
3477000	3479000	a couple of people I know
3479000	3481000	have had this happen
3481000	3483000	so there's a lot of people that are like saying
3483000	3485000	hey this has happened to me and stuff and that's why
3485000	3487000	you know they even kind of made a comment on the story
3487000	3489000	hey uh
3489000	3491000	you know there's been a lot of people that have been writing us saying
3491000	3493000	hey the same thing has happened to me
3493000	3495000	so yeah it's a little bit of a pattern there
3495000	3497000	a little bit gotta figure it out
3497000	3499000	cause
3499000	3501000	and why is it FIFA players?
3501000	3503000	And why is it 30 days that your account
3503000	3505000	remember guys I didn't play my Xbox for a month
3505000	3507000	and I made some purchases
3507000	3509000	on Playstation 3 instead during that time of things
3509000	3511000	I might have bought on the Xbox 360 instead
3511000	3513000	you know so just
3513000	3515000	I think their whole process
3515000	3517000	needs to be fixed that's another big problem
3517000	3519000	Microsoft does some very shady
3519000	3521000	online things that they do you know not just
3521000	3523000	there's the whole credit card removal thing too
3523000	3525000	anyhow
3525000	3527000	as a pain in the ass I refuse to give them my new
3527000	3529000	card I will not give them my new card
3529000	3531000	info cause my last one just expired they will
3531000	3533000	not get my new one they'll still try to charge it though
3533000	3535000	and then when
3535000	3537000	they will still try to charge it good luck
3537000	3539000	they will
3539000	3541000	they will lock out your account until you
3541000	3543000	give them a new card so you need to cancel
3543000	3545000	I will close my Xbox account if it
3545000	3547000	comes to that I'm going on record
3547000	3549000	saying that they are not
3549000	3551000	getting my new credit card number if they
3551000	3553000	were able to
3553000	3555000	I will turn in my seven year
3555000	3557000	whatever it is Xbox Live membership
3557000	3559000	I'm done if that's the
3559000	3561000	case let it be known
3561000	3563000	there's a lot of stuff I see where people will
3563000	3565000	change their credit card and then
3565000	3567000	they'll cause they'll try to renew
3567000	3569000	and then it doesn't auto renew and so
3569000	3571000	they give them a new card to charge it and then
3571000	3573000	they'll charge another year on there and they get two
3573000	3575000	years instead of one
3575000	3577000	see that shit's shady like there's
3577000	3579000	there's a lot of shady shit going on right now
3579000	3581000	in all this Xbox
3581000	3583000	Live stuff and I think we need some answers
3583000	3585000	and stop with this
3585000	3587000	corporate speak
3587000	3589000	you should be able to get out of that stuff
3589000	3591000	this is why people are fucking mad at corporations right now
3591000	3593000	by the way not to go on a tangent that I
3593000	3595000	really don't want to go on on this program but
3595000	3597000	this shit is why people are mad
3597000	3599000	this is why people are mad
3599000	3601000	yeah because you can't take out your credit card you have to call
3601000	3603000	their customer service to remove your credit
3603000	3605000	card information off your account I don't
3605000	3607000	think that should be I think you should be able to do it
3607000	3609000	right away just delete it right out
3609000	3611000	oh boo hoo you can't get the
3611000	3613000	can't auto renew because it's so fucking hard to
3613000	3615000	remove your you know account information
3617000	3619000	alright moving on to a story that you didn't
3619000	3621000	hear anything about just 10 minutes ago on this program
3621000	3623000	some changes are coming to Halo
3623000	3625000	Anniversary talking
3625000	3627000	about the Kinect functionality some of the details
3627000	3629000	came out this week at New York Comic Con
3629000	3631000	there's going to be the feature to
3631000	3633000	analyze enemies
3633000	3635000	meaning that you can like actually talk to your
3635000	3637000	Kinect and go into the library
3637000	3639000	or something like that and look at I don't know
3639000	3641000	your enemies I guess
3641000	3643000	lore or something I don't know
3643000	3645000	what do you need to know about Halo enemies
3645000	3647000	shoot to kill, shoot to kill
3647000	3649000	enhance, enhance
3649000	3651000	and now you're going to be able to shout grenade
3651000	3653000	and your character will
3653000	3655000	throw a grenade
3655000	3657000	amazing and reload weapon
3657000	3659000	we'll also do that too oh that's so much quicker than
3659000	3661000	pushing a button how many times can you shout
3661000	3663000	grenade versus how many times can I
3663000	3665000	push the button this is just all
3665000	3667000	showy shit that you'll
3667000	3669000	never use well it's just like the past showing
3669000	3671000	your friend like look at this grenade
3671000	3673000	oh and this is only
3673000	3675000	possible through Kinect
3675000	3677000	they even said oh you can't do this
3677000	3679000	with like a headset this is only possible
3679000	3681000	through Kinect who gives a fuck
3681000	3683000	and also you know
3683000	3685000	before this the
3685000	3687000	only other thing that they said that you could use your Kinect for
3687000	3689000	was switching between classic
3689000	3691000	and HD mode I want
3691000	3693000	to play classic I want to play HD
3693000	3695000	why would I need to do that on the fly
3695000	3697000	who cares
3697000	3699000	that's not a full price game
3699000	3701000	so
3701000	3703000	alright that's
3703000	3705000	again Halo anniversary edition
3705000	3707000	like in another year probably would have bought
3707000	3709000	the game new but this year just not
3709000	3711000	not enough into it
3711000	3713000	to really want to buy it sorry
3713000	3715000	maybe I'll rent it
3715000	3717000	there won't be an online pass

3959000	3961000	I mean seriously, is that like the third
3961000	3963000	or fourth rugby game that's coming out on
3963000	3965000	Xbox 360? Wasn't one of them like exclusive
3965000	3967000	to Evil G2? Yeah, the last
3967000	3969000	one from 505 was
3969000	3971000	they were exclusive to
3971000	3973000	Don't get your own, rugby's cool, but
3973000	3975000	It's cool, but that's a lot of games

3985000	3987000	Wait, what do you do in Pokémon Rumble Blast?
3987000	3989000	Is that just
3989000	3991000	I think it's like the Pokémon
3991000	3993000	Wasn't there a Pokémon Rumble or Arena
3993000	3995000	game or something like that in the Nintendo 64
3995000	3997000	GameCube? I think it's just like a fighting
3997000	3999000	game, sort of
3999000	4001000	with Pokémon characters
4001000	4003000	I don't know, I don't play Pokémon
4003000	4005000	What?
4005000	4007000	It doesn't matter

4067000	4069000	What is this? Is this like a
4069000	4071000	Oh, it's the movie and the game
4071000	4073000	That's why it's a Hybrid Pack
4073000	4075000	Yeah, it's the movie and PlayStation Network game
4075000	4077000	Yeah, it's like a Blu-Ray
4077000	4079000	So it comes with the Blu-Ray and it comes with the game

4181000	4183000	That's it
4183000	4185000	Busy week over there
4185000	4187000	Just a few more stories for you guys
4187000	4189000	and then the classic game of the week
4189000	4191000	But first, Loki
4191000	4193000	Microsoft has bought Twisted Pixel
4193000	4195000	Of course they just recently put out
4195000	4197000	a few games for the Xbox 360
4197000	4199000	including Explosion Man
4199000	4201000	and The Gun Stringer
4201000	4203000	also Ms. Explosion Man
4203000	4205000	and
4205000	4207000	basically Microsoft is a very big company
4207000	4209000	Twisted Pixel, a relatively
4209000	4211000	small developer
4211000	4213000	We're very interested that they get to stay
4213000	4215000	who they are and they get to retain the
4215000	4217000	magic that they have as a
4217000	4219000	small indie and also we'd like to
4219000	4221000	leave the golden goose alone so to speak
4221000	4223000	So basically they're going to
4223000	4225000	be able to do kind of what they
4225000	4227000	want but still have some financial
4227000	4229000	backing to go with that, maybe some
4229000	4231000	better projects because they'll have a little bit more to
4231000	4233000	work with
4233000	4235000	So that's kind of cool because they're definitely a unique
4235000	4237000	developer
4239000	4241000	I mean it's not too surprising, I kind of
4241000	4243000	already thought they were in bed with Microsoft
4243000	4245000	because hasn't all their shit been exclusive anyway?
4245000	4247000	Um
4247000	4249000	I don't know about that
4249000	4251000	I think they had some stuff that was
4251000	4253000	on PC but
4253000	4255000	yeah, I think for the most
4255000	4257000	part it's been exclusive to
4257000	4259000	Microsoft, probably the Microsoft
4259000	4261000	Well PC still counts if it's for Windows
4261000	4263000	Yeah, that's true
4263000	4265000	So they can still develop for that
4265000	4267000	Um, I'm wondering
4267000	4269000	if they're about to be trusted with some big
4269000	4271000	Microsoft franchise to make a game for that
4271000	4273000	Or I don't know, maybe Microsoft
4273000	4275000	just wants a piece of it You just don't have a lot of big franchises
4275000	4277000	anymore though, I mean
4277000	4279000	the thing about it is just Halo
4279000	4281000	and Forza
4281000	4283000	and Fable I guess
4283000	4285000	but they're not touching Fable I know that
4285000	4287000	Um, who knows
4287000	4289000	there could be something new in the works They could make anything
4289000	4291000	better than Fable 3, that'd be great
4291000	4293000	A new cameo game
4293000	4295000	It could be something new for the new system too
4295000	4297000	you know, there's got to be
4297000	4299000	stuff under development for the new Xbox
4299000	4301000	and we've heard a lot of rumblings about that
4301000	4303000	you know, whatever it may be, so maybe
4303000	4305000	because these guys did
4305000	4307000	you know, Explosion Man and all that
4307000	4309000	they're tasked with making some
4309000	4311000	must have game on the new system
4311000	4313000	who knows, who knows, just throwing it out there
4313000	4315000	I mean there's always new franchises, they can come up with
4315000	4317000	something unique and brand new
4317000	4319000	so sequels
4319000	4321000	Alright, let's see
4321000	4323000	one more story for you guys
4323000	4325000	for this half of the show and that is about
4325000	4327000	Ubisoft delaying a game
4327000	4329000	called Rocksmith
4329000	4331000	You familiar with Rocksmith?
4331000	4333000	That's alright, a lot of people aren't
4333000	4335000	Rocksmith is the game that like, it has like the real
4335000	4337000	guitar with it, which I kind of thought
4337000	4339000	Rock Band 3 was supposed to kind of cover that
4339000	4341000	but I guess Rocksmith
4341000	4343000	is supposed to be more like you actually
4343000	4345000	see the frets on the screen, it's a lot
4345000	4347000	lot different kind of the way it's presented
4347000	4349000	Oh, I think this is the game my friend was working on
4349000	4351000	Oh really? Well, it's been delayed
4351000	4353000	and now it's going to be launched in 2012
4353000	4355000	in Europe, and I guess
4355000	4357000	this is because of some complaint
4357000	4359000	that was against
4359000	4361000	Ubisoft
4361000	4363000	Yeah, filed by a band named Rocksmith
4363000	4365000	Oh, how funny
4365000	4367000	So I guess now there's a whole ugly thing that's got to be
4367000	4369000	settled around that
4369000	4371000	Court documents say that the dispute could
4371000	4373000	go through February 2012
4373000	4375000	so until that's resolved
4375000	4377000	this game is delayed
4377000	4379000	Unless you happen to buy a PS3 version
4379000	4381000	which is region free
4381000	4383000	Oh, okay
4383000	4385000	I mean, if you're really in a hurry, but
4385000	4387000	Is the game not coming out here in America?
4387000	4389000	Yeah, it comes out next week
4389000	4391000	It's just, you know, we don't have a band named
4391000	4393000	Rocksmith over here, and they're over in Europe
4393000	4395000	There you go
4395000	4397000	Alright, well, let's stop talking about
4397000	4399000	these newfangled games
4399000	4401000	and let's go back to the classics
4401000	4403000	Every week on this show, Darkstalker
4403000	4405000	dives into the gaming vault and finds a game
4405000	4407000	that she thinks, hey, listen
4407000	4409000	you kids and your Rocksmith
4409000	4411000	you need to go back and study
4411000	4413000	this classic game from the archives
4413000	4415000	the way games used to be
4415000	4417000	Darkstalker, what's the classic
4417000	4419000	game of the week?
4419000	4421000	Castle of Illusion starring Mickey Mouse
4421000	4423000	because we talked about it last week and I started
4423000	4425000	thinking about it, so it's this
4425000	4427000	In Japan it was known as
4427000	4429000	Castle of Illusion I Love Mickey Mouse
4429000	4431000	Great Wonderland Castle Adventure
4431000	4433000	Really long name, huh?
4433000	4435000	And it came out in 1990, and it was on
4435000	4437000	the Mega Drive slash
4437000	4439000	Genesis, developed by Sega of Japan
4439000	4441000	and it was
4441000	4443000	one of the
4443000	4445000	parts of the games that were released
4445000	4447000	right before Sonic Hedgehog came out
4447000	4449000	And I love this game, so
4449000	4451000	shut up. It's a side-scrolling
4451000	4453000	game, and you play as Mickey Mouse
4453000	4455000	and he has to save Minnie from
4455000	4457000	this evil witch named Mizrebel
4457000	4459000	who wants to steal Minnie's youth
4459000	4461000	because Minnie apparently is
4461000	4463000	young and pretty
4463000	4465000	And who I believe was not actually
4465000	4467000	a Disney villain otherwise though, right?
4467000	4469000	I don't think so
4469000	4471000	This is interesting that they didn't use
4471000	4473000	a quote-unquote real villain, but anyway
4473000	4475000	You know what?
4475000	4477000	No villain is as awesome as Maleficent
4477000	4479000	the damn diva
4479000	4481000	So, moving forward
4481000	4483000	You play in the castle, and you have to
4483000	4485000	defeat different enemies and bosses by jumping
4485000	4487000	on them, which makes you jump higher
4487000	4489000	And you get apples and marbles to use as
4489000	4491000	projectiles, and you get health
4491000	4493000	boosts and extra lives or
4493000	4495000	bonus points, and then after you beat the
4495000	4497000	boss, you're given a gem. When you get all
4497000	4499000	of the gems, you build a rainbow bridge
4499000	4501000	that lets Mickey walk into the castle
4501000	4503000	so you can fight the witch in the tower
4503000	4505000	And her, uh
4505000	4507000	Now, I need to double check this
4507000	4509000	reference because it says that her younger version
4509000	4511000	looks like the evil queen
4511000	4513000	from Snow White
4513000	4515000	It does kinda look like
4515000	4517000	Yeah
4517000	4519000	Who knows? Maybe it is her
4519000	4521000	It also did come out on the Master System
4521000	4523000	but they redid it
4523000	4525000	And so the Game Gear version is actually exactly
4525000	4527000	like the Master System version because it's one
4527000	4529000	of the ones that ran in Game Gear
4529000	4531000	One of the Game Gear games that ran
4531000	4533000	in Master System compatibility mode
4533000	4535000	So, um
4535000	4537000	I mean, there's not really a whole lot to say about it
4537000	4539000	It's a cute game. It's got some good challenge
4539000	4541000	to it. It's fun
4541000	4543000	Um
4543000	4545000	I mean, Rob, you're looking
4545000	4547000	at it, right? Yeah, it's a fun little platformer
4547000	4549000	You know, I didn't own a Genesis when I was younger
4549000	4551000	But I do remember, I remember there was kind of
4551000	4553000	a stink because this came out around
4553000	4555000	maybe a year or two after the NES
4555000	4557000	had Mickey Mousecapade
4557000	4559000	Which was kind of their big game
4559000	4561000	And Capcom had the Disney license for Nintendo
4561000	4563000	though. They weren't really putting stuff out on
4563000	4565000	Genesis at the time. In fact, wasn't Capcom's
4565000	4567000	first Genesis game, the Street Fighter
4567000	4569000	Championship Edition? I think it was
4569000	4571000	I think so. I seem to remember that
4571000	4573000	from my gaming history
4573000	4575000	Well, the Street Fighter 2 came out before
4575000	4577000	Championship Edition
4577000	4579000	Well, no, but remember the Genesis one
4579000	4581000	The Genesis got the Championship Edition
4581000	4583000	It was like a big freaking deal
4583000	4585000	But then the Super Nintendo got Turbo Championship Edition
4585000	4587000	So it kind of went back and forth
4587000	4589000	But anyway, my point is that I do remember
4589000	4591000	this game. I never played it when I was younger
4591000	4593000	because I didn't own a Genesis
4593000	4595000	But I remember wanting to because I thought
4595000	4597000	Gosh, this game looks a lot better than Mickey Mousecapade
4597000	4599000	Which actually was a pretty sweet
4599000	4601000	NES game. Yeah. I don't know if you've done
4601000	4603000	that as a classic game of the week before, but if you haven't
4603000	4605000	it should be someday. Well, this one
4605000	4607000	actually, I don't know if I've ever told you about
4607000	4609000	the week I traded my SNES for my friend's
4609000	4611000	Genesis and
4611000	4613000	Master System Converter
4613000	4615000	This is one of the games I borrowed
4615000	4617000	Oh, nice. And I had
4617000	4619000	a field day with this game
4619000	4621000	I loved it so much. I mean, there's
4621000	4623000	so much more to do. I mean, not just
4623000	4625000	you had the, you know, the
4625000	4627000	jumping boosts and you had swinging
4627000	4629000	from vines. Just graphically
4629000	4631000	this game was really pretty to look
4631000	4633000	at. You have to remember again, guys, this was a long
4633000	4635000	time ago this game came out. But some of these
4635000	4637000	environments, like this level that we're watching
4637000	4639000	Mickey in here on the YouTube right now, in
4639000	4641000	this like spider web
4641000	4643000	where he's floating on leaves
4643000	4645000	Like for a game of this era, it looks
4645000	4647000	fantastic. It's like paintings
4647000	4649000	You know? And that was the first thing
4649000	4651000	that really got me is just like, oh it's
4651000	4653000	so pretty and look how rich the colors
4653000	4655000	are and blah blah blah blah blah
4655000	4657000	You're climbing up a tree
4657000	4659000	I think this is a very important Genesis game. It really is
4659000	4661000	Well, um
4661000	4663000	There was a sequel
4663000	4665000	Sorry, I was just going to say weird that it's never shown up on
4665000	4667000	any collection. I mean, I understand probably the Disney
4667000	4669000	licensing probably has a lot to do with that
4669000	4671000	Well, now they've licensed, though
4671000	4673000	Disney took the license for Castle Illusion
4673000	4675000	Oh, that's right. That was recent
4675000	4677000	I remember that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, okay
4677000	4679000	And we don't know what they're doing with it. Right, right
4679000	4681000	Right. Probably just sitting on it for a while
4681000	4683000	I hope there's like maybe like a
4683000	4685000	newer version of this coming out. That'd be awesome
4685000	4687000	Well, let me go a little bit
4687000	4689000	further then. Sure, sure. Okay, well
4689000	4691000	first of all, there was a sequel named Land of Illusion
4691000	4693000	that came out of the Master System into Game Gear
4693000	4695000	and then Castle Evolution was re-released
4695000	4697000	in 1998 in Japan as
4697000	4699000	the Sega Ages Mickey Mouse and Donald
4699000	4701000	Duck on Saturn
4701000	4703000	and that also included Quack Shot
4703000	4705000	which is a very
4705000	4707000	interesting game on its own, too
4707000	4709000	So, uh, there you go
4709000	4711000	It did have a re-release in Japan
4711000	4713000	Alright
4713000	4715000	Very cool
4715000	4717000	There it is, your classic game of the week
4717000	4719000	Castle of Illusion starring Mickey Mouse
4719000	4721000	for the Sega Genesis. Nice pick
4721000	4723000	Thank you. Alright, that's gonna do it
4723000	4725000	for part A of our big show tonight
4725000	4727000	but don't go anywhere. We're not done
4727000	4729000	We've still got half a show to go. We've got a lot of news
4729000	4731000	coming out in the next half of the show
4731000	4733000	and gonna get to your emails as well
4733000	4735000	at mailbagatorangelaundry.com and
4735000	4737000	twitter topics and hopefully, I'm hoping
4737000	4739000	some people will call us that went to
4739000	4741000	our Comic Con cause I know we've got several
4741000	4743000	people that went cause I wanna hear about
4743000	4745000	Bungee Ferret Tossing which by the way, did you
4745000	4747000	did you see the art on twitter?
4747000	4749000	I don't know if you've seen this. Sorry. No. Some art was
4749000	4751000	released of the main character
4751000	4753000	in Bungee Ferret Tossing officially
4753000	4755000	now named Fernando of the French
4755000	4757000	Canadian Army. Yes. So
4757000	4759000	I will, uh, you haven't seen that fan art?
4759000	4761000	I'm gonna look. I'm gonna go to
4761000	4763000	YYR's twitter. He's like, it's like
4763000	4765000	YYR underscore or maybe the other way
4765000	4767000	around, underscore YYR. It's one of the two
4767000	4769000	and he has the artwork in one of his previous tweets.
4769000	4771000	It's awesome. So anyhow, we'll talk
4771000	4773000	with you guys in the skype line as well
4773000	4775000	as plenty more news when we come back with more
4775000	4777000	of Orange Lounge Radio. Don't go anywhere.
4783000	4785000	Welcome back everybody to Orange
4785000	4787000	Lounge Radio. We are
4787000	4789000	live on this Sunday evening.
4789000	4791000	October the 16th of 2011.
4791000	4793000	I'm out of breath. That was such a fast
4793000	4795000	break. Where we're
4795000	4797000	of course taping another episode of our show. Episode
4797000	4799000	number 432 to
4799000	4801000	be exact. I was showing
4801000	4803000	Dark Soccer the picture of Fernando
4803000	4805000	during the break from Bungee Ferret Tossing which
4805000	4807000	I guess we're gonna get some calls during part B.
4807000	4809000	Some people are already private messaging
4809000	4811000	me in chat wanting
4811000	4813000	to talk about the game. So we're gonna hear more about it
4813000	4815000	later. But. Awesome.
4815000	4817000	Do you approve of Fernando?
4817000	4819000	I do. I do too. I'm gonna have to draw.
4819000	4821000	My favorite is the ferret with the tongue
4821000	4823000	hanging out of his mouth like ahh dead ferret.
4823000	4825000	I feel like drawing the ferret.
4825000	4827000	The question is when's Ronma gonna
4827000	4829000	cosplay that?
4829000	4831000	It's just
4831000	4833000	a matter of time.
4833000	4835000	Alright look. You're gonna have to bulk up
4835000	4837000	for it though cause Fernando looks pretty ripped.
4837000	4839000	So I'm just saying. I don't think
4839000	4841000	it's gonna be that hard for Ronchon. He was a
4841000	4843000	marine.
4843000	4845000	Alright. Let's move on to some
4845000	4847000	rapid fire news. Every night we like
4847000	4849000	to or every night that we do a show anyway we like to
4849000	4851000	go through some news quickly cause we don't have
4851000	4853000	a whole lot of time. It's not a six hour show.
4853000	4855000	But we do want to bring to your attention
4855000	4857000	a few other things going on in the gaming world.
4857000	4859000	We do need another marathon show. Speaking of marathons
4859000	4861000	I gotta mention this. I can't believe I didn't show all this
4861000	4863000	somewhere else. I need to mention this. Need to need to need to.
4863000	4865000	Extra Life happened this past weekend
4865000	4867000	and congratulations. They
4867000	4869000	broke a million dollars. That is outstanding.
4869000	4871000	And I know we had some members of the
4871000	4873000	OL army that participated in Extra Life.
4873000	4875000	So. The moment you announced that Shermie started
4875000	4877000	licking her bed in excitement. At least
4877000	4879000	she didn't shit the bed. That's good. So she approves.
4879000	4881000	Like licking is like shitting is for the tester.
4881000	4883000	Now she's licking her pond.
4883000	4885000	Well she was until you decided to look.
4885000	4887000	So she approves of the fact that Extra Life
4887000	4889000	raised that money. That is flippin
4889000	4891000	fantastic. And I'm sorry we couldn't participate
4891000	4893000	ourselves but you know we are
4893000	4895000	thinking about charity in the back of our mind
4895000	4897000	and maybe what we can do later on.
4897000	4899000	Also speaking of charity
4899000	4901000	the date for the new Umlaut I think
4901000	4903000	was announced previously but
4903000	4905000	just to reiterate it's December 8th this
4905000	4907000	year and it's gonna be flippin
4907000	4909000	huge. Like I
4909000	4911000	can't say too much. I may or
4911000	4913000	may not know some things
4913000	4915000	but it is on Thursday December 8th and
4915000	4917000	it's gonna be awesome.
4917000	4919000	Awesome.
4919000	4921000	So if you are like anywhere remotely near
4921000	4923000	the San Francisco Bay Area you need to make plans
4923000	4925000	to attend. If you are
4925000	4927000	nowhere near the San Francisco Bay Area
4927000	4929000	you still should keep the day open.
4929000	4931000	Just saying. Moving on.
4931000	4933000	Let's go through some
4933000	4935000	quick quick news. Loki.
4935000	4937000	This is quite appropriate and I'm actually kind of
4937000	4939000	psyched to play it cause this is more of a puzzle game
4939000	4941000	than it is a crashing game.
4941000	4943000	But Burnout Crash is gonna be
4943000	4945000	coming to the IOS both on
4945000	4947000	iPad and
4947000	4949000	iPod or iPhone
4949000	4951000	or whatever. So you can
4951000	4953000	check that out. I think that's actually
4953000	4955000	a pretty good fit for it because
4955000	4957000	yeah like you said it's more of a puzzle game
4957000	4959000	and kind of disappointing.
4959000	4961000	But still fun. Still fun.
4961000	4963000	So check that out.
4963000	4965000	No word yet on when it's coming.
4965000	4967000	This holiday season they say.
4967000	4969000	Anytime between now and the end of the year.
4969000	4971000	This is kind of cool.
4971000	4973000	There's gonna be a free to replace
4973000	4975000	Shadowrun game coming.
4975000	4977000	And it's an online
4977000	4979000	MMO. I guess originally
4979000	4981000	you know I guess
4981000	4983000	the game was supposed to be inspired by Counter Strike
4983000	4985000	but now it kind of
4985000	4987000	I don't know it's more top down. It looks to me
4987000	4989000	like one of the old
4989000	4991000	Fallout games or something like that.
4991000	4993000	They're calling it kind of
4993000	4995000	Baldur's Gate with
4995000	4997000	Jagged Alliance but
4997000	4999000	I think it's awesome because honestly
4999000	5001000	the last Shadowrun game that came out in 360
5001000	5003000	was terrible so this
5003000	5005000	this is more like it.
5005000	5007000	And it's free to play so
5007000	5009000	cool. And it's being made by
5009000	5011000	Sixth World I guess.
5013000	5015000	I don't know if they're
5015000	5017000	no Sixth World was the last one
5017000	5019000	I'm sorry. Cliffhanger is the one that's
5019000	5021000	putting this together now.
5021000	5023000	Oh god. That's gonna be awesome.
5023000	5025000	No word yet on what's coming out but
5025000	5027000	Shadowrun definitely has its fans.
5027000	5029000	And you know there's been some hit and miss games
5029000	5031000	in the Shadowrun universe so this sounds neat.
5031000	5033000	It looks cool. I mean it could be a franchise
5033000	5035000	if done well. It would be
5035000	5037000	successful so. Neat.
5037000	5039000	And then last but not least of course
5039000	5041000	PopCap. They're always
5041000	5043000	putting out gamer
5043000	5045000	crack if you will. They have a new
5045000	5047000	game coming out
5047000	5049000	called Popcorn Dragon.
5049000	5051000	And in Popcorn Dragon you
5051000	5053000	shoot fireballs to make popcorn
5053000	5055000	that a dragon then attempts to eat.
5055000	5057000	They're saying it's kind of like a popcorn
5057000	5059000	fruit ninja with a cute mythical beast.
5059000	5061000	That sounds so PopCap.
5061000	5063000	Like when you describe it I'm like god
5063000	5065000	that just sounds like a PopCap game.
5065000	5067000	To be fair I don't think we've really
5067000	5069000	heard of anything that that studio has done for a while.
5069000	5071000	I mean their last big big game was Plants vs.
5071000	5073000	Zombies. That was some time ago.
5073000	5075000	Well they have to port it to every single platform.
5075000	5077000	Bejeweled 3.
5077000	5079000	Oh yeah shit I forgot about Bejeweled 3.
5079000	5081000	You're right you're right you're right.
5081000	5083000	And then it wasn't technically PopCap.
5083000	5085000	The spinoff studio.
5085000	5087000	I really wish they'd do more stuff because
5087000	5089000	unpleasant horse is fucking amazing.
5089000	5091000	But
5091000	5093000	yeah they had a few things.
5093000	5095000	This looks alright. It looks like it could be cool.
5095000	5097000	And I do like
5097000	5099000	Popcorn and dragons.
5099000	5101000	So it'll be worth checking out.
5101000	5103000	That's the quote they're gonna put on the box.
5103000	5105000	If you like popcorn.
5105000	5107000	I do love popcorn and dragons.
5107000	5109000	It just made me think about having
5109000	5111000	a little pet dragon and watching a movie
5111000	5113000	and going dammit I want to pop
5113000	5115000	this popcorn.
5115000	5117000	Who doesn't love popcorn
5117000	5119000	and dragons? Terrorists that's who.
5119000	5121000	You know what I don't like popcorn.
5121000	5123000	Really? Because the corn kernels get stuck
5123000	5125000	up under my gums and it hurts.
5125000	5127000	Without fail.
5127000	5129000	I guess that's a fair but you like dragons.
5129000	5131000	Yes.
5131000	5133000	Because dragons will smite my enemies for me.
5133000	5135000	So you're not completely evil.
5135000	5137000	I guess I can see that in Popcorn.
5137000	5139000	I do get annoyed with popcorn kernels too.
5139000	5141000	Would it be my weakness?
5141000	5143000	And people at work who can't cook popcorn
5143000	5145000	with dam.
5145000	5147000	And end up making the whole building smell like
5147000	5149000	burp popcorn.
5149000	5151000	I love burnt popcorn.
5151000	5153000	I purposefully burn my popcorn.
5153000	5155000	Just say her.
5155000	5157000	You are the office asshole.
5157000	5159000	My desk was like
5159000	5161000	two rows from the break room.
5161000	5163000	So it would smell like this burnt shit all the time.
5163000	5165000	Whereas I was perfect.
5165000	5167000	And I had
5167000	5169000	our crappy microwaves.
5169000	5171000	You were perfect?
5171000	5173000	As for popping popcorn at work.
5173000	5175000	I had our crappy microwaves timed
5175000	5177000	that I could always do the perfect
5177000	5179000	container of popcorn with only a couple
5179000	5181000	of kernels left at the bottom and nothing burnt.
5181000	5183000	The end.
5183000	5185000	I follow the directions
5185000	5187000	completely but I know when to pull
5187000	5189000	it out so that it has...
5189000	5191000	You know when to pull out?
5191000	5193000	Yes. I know when to pull the popcorn out
5193000	5195000	of the microwave.
5195000	5197000	Oh you.
5197000	5199000	You adolescent
5199000	5201000	children. You know how to pull it out when the explosion
5201000	5203000	is just right.
5203000	5205000	Hey I don't want to singe anything
5205000	5207000	in there so.
5207000	5209000	I have to make sure. With that dragon of yours.
5209000	5211000	Cause you know.
5211000	5213000	Cause if you leave it in too long
5213000	5215000	it's just gonna be waffen smoke
5215000	5217000	all over the building so.
5217000	5219000	You just have to know when to take it out.
5219000	5221000	And then it stinks all day.
5221000	5223000	Exactly.
5223000	5225000	This is the clip I want them to play
5225000	5227000	at the podcast awards.
5227000	5229000	But yeah.
5229000	5231000	What started it was
5231000	5233000	I had bags of
5233000	5235000	non buttered popcorn that people gave me
5235000	5237000	and it was just nasty.
5237000	5239000	You have to burn it a little bit to give it a little bit of a
5239000	5241000	smokey taste to it.
5241000	5243000	Just enough.
5243000	5245000	It doesn't smell too bad.
5245000	5247000	Okay as gross as the story is
5247000	5249000	and as non-video gaming related as the story is
5249000	5251000	I have to tell it. I'm like kind of the opposite
5251000	5253000	of you Loki. Burnt popcorn
5253000	5255000	not really a fan. But what I'm a
5255000	5257000	total fan of and can't get enough of
5257000	5259000	are like the barely popped kernels.
5259000	5261000	Like the kernels that have popped a little bit
5261000	5263000	but are like
5263000	5265000	not all the way popped.
5265000	5267000	I will pull a microwave. I'll pull out
5267000	5269000	early.
5269000	5271000	Just to get a bag full of those
5271000	5273000	because those are the
5273000	5275000	delicious kernels in my opinion
5275000	5277000	are the ones that are like barely popped. Of course they're also the worst
5277000	5279000	for your teeth but whatever.
5279000	5281000	So. Alright.
5281000	5283000	Moving on to non
5283000	5285000	dragon related things.
5285000	5287000	Only us can you know
5287000	5289000	take a pop cap game and turn it into
5289000	5291000	pulling out.
5291000	5293000	Alright moving on.
5293000	5295000	Do you hear these sounds in the background?
5295000	5297000	This is the sound
5297000	5299000	of BurgerTime on Xbox Live
5299000	5301000	Arcade.
5301000	5303000	That's right. BurgerTime Xbox Live Arcade
5303000	5305000	it has a release. It is November
5305000	5307000	2nd is when this is coming out.
5307000	5309000	And look it's kind of an old
5309000	5311000	OLR in joke. It hasn't come up a lot lately
5311000	5313000	but I really defend the old
5313000	5315000	arcade classic BurgerTime
5315000	5317000	is vastly underrated. It's a great
5317000	5319000	game. I actually
5319000	5321000	contrary to popular belief I don't really believe
5321000	5323000	it's like the best arcade game ever made.
5323000	5325000	But it's a fun one. And it's underrated.
5325000	5327000	And I have to admit this looks pretty cool
5327000	5329000	what they're doing with the whole like round
5329000	5331000	platforms and the graphical upgrades.
5331000	5333000	Hopefully it retains some of that charm of the original
5333000	5335000	and I'm really excited to try multiplayer.
5335000	5337000	So I will get to do all that
5337000	5339000	on November 2nd because that's what
5339000	5341000	the release date is according to Monkeypaw Games.
5341000	5343000	Who's making it?
5343000	5345000	Infinity Blade of course very popular game
5345000	5347000	on the iOS platform. I have yet to play it.
5347000	5349000	I don't know why I've been dodging it.
5349000	5351000	But very popular.
5351000	5353000	It is actually going to be coming to arcades.
5353000	5355000	That struck me as very interesting.
5355000	5357000	But Infinity Blade FX
5357000	5359000	is making its way to
5359000	5361000	I guess Dave and Busters
5361000	5363000	and other
5363000	5365000	types of facilities
5365000	5367000	like that. So it's kind of cool.
5367000	5369000	Apparently though they have other games that they've
5369000	5371000	ported with us like Fruit Ninja.
5371000	5373000	Flight Control is the other one.
5373000	5375000	Any game that has a big old
5375000	5377000	touch screen they say 46 inches
5377000	5379000	is going to have this.
5379000	5381000	They're saying it's going to be in all
5381000	5383000	57 Dave and Busters locations
5383000	5385000	of which we have a brand new one here in Roseville
5385000	5387000	not too far away. So Dark
5387000	5389000	Sakura we might have to go to Dave and
5389000	5391000	Busters on assignment for the show.
5391000	5393000	Ok let's do it.
5393000	5395000	We'll make that sacrifice. By October
5395000	5397000	28th so we'll have to go just after that to
5397000	5399000	make sure that the game is there. And then I can finally
5399000	5401000	play Infinity Blade be it in arcade form.
5401000	5403000	One other story before
5403000	5405000	I turn it over to Dark Sakura and that has to do with
5405000	5407000	Leisure Suit Larry. Ok look before
5407000	5409000	they ruined it like 5 years ago
5409000	5411000	with the versions that were on the regular Xbox
5411000	5413000	and Playstation 2. Leisure Suit Larry
5413000	5415000	was kind of an epic game like
5415000	5417000	back in the day. Not actually by Epic
5417000	5419000	it was by Sierra. But anyway it was a great
5419000	5421000	adventure game back in the day. Well Leisure Suit Larry
5421000	5423000	in the land of the lounge lizards
5423000	5425000	is being remade.
5425000	5427000	That is the original game in the series.
5427000	5429000	They're remaking it with an HD
5429000	5431000	upgrade for the series 25th
5431000	5433000	anniversary which is coming up at the
5433000	5435000	end of 2012. Surprisingly
5435000	5437000	enough it's not Telltale doing
5437000	5439000	it. Which I would have thought
5439000	5441000	point and click adventure game surely this is
5441000	5443000	Telltale is doing. No it's actually being done by somebody
5443000	5445000	else. It's being done by Replay Games
5445000	5447000	and this is very important. Al
5447000	5449000	Lowe who did the original
5449000	5451000	series this has his blessing
5451000	5453000	and he's working with them on it.
5453000	5455000	It should be noted the games
5455000	5457000	that came out within the past 5 years
5457000	5459000	he had nothing to do with. And in fact
5459000	5461000	he was kind of a bitter
5461000	5463000	betty about them and I can't say I blame him.
5463000	5465000	In fact listen to this quote
5465000	5467000	to EGM that he said
5467000	5469000	quote I'm overjoyed to see Larry released
5469000	5471000	from his digital dungeon after all this
5471000	5473000	time and be placed in the hands
5473000	5475000	of someone who understands him and
5475000	5477000	wants to see him brought back to
5477000	5479000	the forefront by people who love him and
5479000	5481000	understand him. That's what we call
5481000	5483000	subtly throwing shade.
5483000	5485000	That's also a little redundant.
5485000	5487000	A little bit but. Well you may remember
5487000	5489000	that Leisure Suit Larry before was released
5489000	5491000	by Venvedi
5491000	5493000	Universal who put out wonderful
5493000	5495000	franchise killing games
5495000	5497000	like the Spyro series, the Crash
5497000	5499000	series and of course the Leisure Suit Larry
5499000	5501000	series.
5501000	5503000	Thank you and guess who bought Venvedi
5503000	5505000	Universal? Activision.
5505000	5507000	See where we're going
5507000	5509000	here? Well they must have not optioned to
5509000	5511000	continue this series and after the last couple games
5511000	5513000	I can't imagine why. So now Replay Games
5513000	5515000	picked it up. What's cool about this, Replay
5515000	5517000	has said that if they're successful they're
5517000	5519000	going to keep doing these HD updates
5519000	5521000	through all the original games.
5521000	5523000	So that's kind of rad.
5523000	5525000	They're also planning on some new games.
5525000	5527000	So let's just hope it
5527000	5529000	doesn't suck.
5529000	5531000	Moving on, DarkSakura.
5531000	5533000	Well, how
5533000	5535000	about some stuff about the Nintendo DS?
5535000	5537000	No, I don't want to hear it.
5537000	5539000	Okay. There has
5539000	5541000	been over 50 million
5541000	5543000	units sold in the US.
5543000	5545000	And this was
5545000	5547000	numbers presented by Nintendo.
5547000	5549000	That's 7 years
5549000	5551000	post launch, still selling, and
5551000	5553000	like I said, 50 million
5553000	5555000	units. I wonder if that includes 3 DS's
5555000	5557000	because technically it's kind of part of the DS
5557000	5559000	family. It says and its variants.
5559000	5561000	Okay, there you go.
5561000	5563000	Also, for Ultimate Marvel
5563000	5565000	vs. Capcom 3, there
5565000	5567000	is going to be a playable Galactus mode.
5567000	5569000	That's pretty cool.
5569000	5571000	You can just have him
5571000	5573000	smack people with his bitch slap and
5573000	5575000	his flick attack, I guess.
5575000	5577000	You know who else I saw on there, by the way?
5577000	5579000	Phoenix Wright. Yeah, I heard about that too.
5579000	5581000	Phoenix Wright's in it.
5581000	5583000	Pretty cool.
5583000	5585000	Is it bad that I thought he was in the original one?
5585000	5587000	I did not play the original one.
5587000	5589000	They put in Frank West.
5589000	5591000	That's awesome. Frank West is
5591000	5593000	awesome. I love that character.
5593000	5595000	I mean, that's kind of a why, except
5595000	5597000	I guess he's pretty cool, you know.
5597000	5599000	And then last but not least, Star Wars
5599000	5601000	The Old Republic has a European
5601000	5603000	release date. It will be out on the 20th of December.
5603000	5605000	Two days earlier than
5605000	5607000	it was announced. Yeah, I was going to say they bumped it up a little bit
5607000	5609000	because it was supposed to be a
5609000	5611000	variance. Just a teens.
5611000	5613000	In MMO speak, three days
5613000	5615000	is a big deal, so it's nice that
5615000	5617000	Europe got parity with that.
5617000	5619000	In fact, the 20th for
5619000	5621000	them starts earlier than it
5621000	5623000	will for us, so now we're getting shafted.
5623000	5625000	Oh, Rob.
5625000	5627000	Alright, it's just one day.
5627000	5629000	It's not a big deal.
5629000	5631000	Alright, so
5631000	5633000	let's get back into some more long
5633000	5635000	form news. Of course, coming up
5635000	5637000	later in the show, the mailbag at
5637000	5639000	mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com is where you can always send us
5639000	5641000	emails. And the FUs of the week coming
5641000	5643000	up as well as Twitter topics. Make sure you
5643000	5645000	get those in because we will read Twitters
5645000	5647000	while we're waiting for calls
5647000	5649000	at Twitter.com slash
5649000	5651000	O-L-R. So get those all in right now.
5651000	5653000	Loki. Unfortunately,
5653000	5655000	you know, when you're a game
5655000	5657000	studio that produces
5657000	5659000	all the Harry Potter games
5659000	5661000	for the movies, and then the movie series ends,
5661000	5663000	what's
5663000	5665000	left for you than
5665000	5667000	to just, you know, go under?
5667000	5669000	I actually have an answer to that, but I'll let you
5669000	5671000	finish the story. Yes.
5671000	5673000	Apparently, the
5673000	5675000	Bright Light Studios is now
5675000	5677000	under a formal
5677000	5679000	under the formal
5679000	5681000	consultation process
5681000	5683000	and they basically
5683000	5685000	the employees that are impacted
5685000	5687000	will be considered for other positions
5687000	5689000	at other EA studios
5689000	5691000	including those in the UK.
5691000	5693000	The UK is a vital center for
5693000	5695000	of game development
5695000	5697000	for EA and we intend to maintain
5697000	5699000	a strong presence there. And of course
5699000	5701000	you know
5701000	5703000	the last few games that they put out and kind of
5703000	5705000	ehhh. But you know
5705000	5707000	the movie tie-in games weren't really
5707000	5709000	they don't have a high bar to hit
5709000	5711000	but even then they missed those. So
5711000	5713000	maybe it's
5713000	5715000	for the best. I mean it sucks
5715000	5717000	that people are out of work, but come on man
5717000	5719000	maybe they'll reform
5719000	5721000	with some better hands
5721000	5723000	leading the brigade. You know sometimes
5723000	5725000	sometimes that's the silver lining that comes out of
5725000	5727000	these studio closures is that you know
5727000	5729000	they'll reform with different
5729000	5731000	direction and that could be a good thing.
5731000	5733000	The one thing I do want to say about this though
5733000	5735000	to answer the question, what could they be doing now?
5735000	5737000	A Harry Potter MMO?
5737000	5739000	Like. I would not want them
5739000	5741000	doing that. Well yeah and maybe this is
5741000	5743000	for the best. Like it sounds like based on
5743000	5745000	the games that they've made and I've played some of these games
5745000	5747000	they're not that great.
5747000	5749000	They should
5749000	5751000	put it in more capable hands if they're going to do a
5751000	5753000	Harry Potter MMO but seriously I'm not even
5753000	5755000	that into the Harry Potter universe. I still haven't
5755000	5757000	seen a single movie past the third movie
5757000	5759000	and I really haven't read the books.
5759000	5761000	I would
5761000	5763000	try this game in a heartbeat because
5763000	5765000	that universe would just be fun.
5765000	5767000	It's meant for a video game. Another game
5767000	5769000	that they created that
5769000	5771000	also was terrible. Create.
5771000	5773000	What the hell is that? It was supposed
5773000	5775000	to be a thing that was going to take on Little Big
5775000	5777000	Planet. Came out last year. No one gave
5777000	5779000	a shit about it. Was that the Xbox thing? It was
5779000	5781000	Xbox, Playstation 3 and Wii.
5781000	5783000	Terrible! What was
5783000	5785000	Microsoft's answer to that? Didn't they have something?
5785000	5787000	Oh that was also terrible. That ended up being an
5787000	5789000	indie games thing didn't it?
5789000	5791000	It was not Zubo.
5791000	5793000	Was it Zubo? I don't remember. I don't know. They also did a game
5793000	5795000	called Zubo on the DS but
5795000	5797000	yeah I don't remember.
5797000	5799000	The other thing I want to say about
5799000	5801000	Harry Potter. Pottermore.
5801000	5803000	There could be game material in there.
5803000	5805000	I don't know. I just
5805000	5807000	I don't know. I would really like to
5807000	5809000	see an MMO come out of the Harry Potter universe
5809000	5811000	but it does need to be done right. Don't
5811000	5813000	do a shitty MMO or people are going to be upset.
5813000	5815000	So.
5815000	5817000	Alright. Anything else before I move on?
5817000	5819000	Yeah but it's a tangent so I'm not going to go there
5819000	5821000	right now. Alright why not? I'm going to start another story
5821000	5823000	so go ahead. Go for the tangent. I forgot to mention
5823000	5825000	since it wasn't really my gaming week
5825000	5827000	and one of the reasons why I didn't play a lot of games
5827000	5829000	this week because I was reading Ready Player
5829000	5831000	One. It's fucking amazing.
5831000	5833000	Oh yeah that was the book you were talking about last week.
5833000	5835000	I'm serious. Any of our listeners
5835000	5837000	for the show this book is for you. I mean
5837000	5839000	it's absolutely without a doubt
5839000	5841000	for you. Can I get it on Kindle?
5841000	5843000	Yes. Maybe I'll check it out.
5843000	5845000	Dude I mean
5845000	5847000	not the spoil stuff but like
5847000	5849000	be careful.
5849000	5851000	Okay I'm going to spoil one thing but it is kind of cool.
5851000	5853000	The very first challenge
5853000	5855000	that this guy has to go through to get this
5855000	5857000	because you have to find three keys and unlock
5857000	5859000	the gates to find an easter egg
5859000	5861000	that basically gets you the
5861000	5863000	assets of this company. This guy
5863000	5865000	is like a multi-billion dollar thing.
5865000	5867000	So it's a little bit like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory
5867000	5869000	with the treasure hunt and stuff like that.
5869000	5871000	He has to fight a lich.
5871000	5873000	Is it the lich king?
5873000	5875000	He has to joust the lich
5875000	5877000	and the uh
5877000	5879000	it's like I forget the dungeon
5879000	5881000	it's some dungeon from Dungeons and Dragons.
5881000	5883000	Is it the lich from Shadowgate?
5883000	5885000	Not the lich from Shadowgate. But he has to fight him
5885000	5887000	he has to joust him
5887000	5889000	on the old arcade game
5889000	5891000	joust.
5891000	5893000	I knew something was coming with that.
5893000	5895000	Seriously it's a fucking amazing
5895000	5897000	book. You said this has been optioned for a movie right?
5897000	5899000	It has been optioned for a movie.
5899000	5901000	Warner Brother bought the rights last year.
5901000	5903000	I'm serious. Go check this book out
5903000	5905000	now. It's great.
5905000	5907000	Speaking of movies and all that stuff
5907000	5909000	I have to get this out there.
5909000	5911000	You know how like I talked a lot last week about the
5911000	5913000	various shadow casting stuff that's going on in town
5913000	5915000	you know I did Repo last week
5915000	5917000	and there's Rocky Horror of course is the king
5917000	5919000	of shadow cast movies and I think there's people
5919000	5921000	that shadow cast other movies too. Do you know what
5921000	5923000	shadow cast I believe
5923000	5925000	I have heard rumblings of this and I think it was on a
5925000	5927000	website somewhere and it was in the paper
5927000	5929000	in an article on the group here that does
5929000	5931000	a lot of shadow casts. Do you know what movie they're planning
5931000	5933000	to shadow cast next year here in Sacramento?
5933000	5935000	What? Scott Pilgrim vs. The World.
5935000	5937000	Awesome!
5937000	5939000	And now you know the movie
5939000	5941000	when I first saw it was only kind of eh
5941000	5943000	but thinking about seeing
5943000	5945000	that movie in a group of very
5945000	5947000	like minded individuals who are going to be there
5947000	5949000	for the sheer cheese factor of it I actually think
5949000	5951000	it's going to be pretty fucking awesome.
5951000	5953000	So. But I'm serious.
5953000	5955000	Go. I don't read books
5955000	5957000	a lot. I mean hardly ever.
5957000	5959000	And I couldn't put the book
5959000	5961000	down. I had to read the whole thing straight through
5961000	5963000	until I finished it. And it's just
5963000	5965000	it's seriously
5965000	5967000	if you're a fan of the 80's stuff, if you're a fan of
5967000	5969000	classic video games, if you're a fan of
5969000	5971000	just cool like kind of
5971000	5973000	where's the internet going to go? That type
5973000	5975000	of thing. And you got to read
5975000	5977000	this. It's just amazing. Anyways.
5977000	5979000	So that's my tangent there.
5979000	5981000	Moving on to some other news.
5981000	5983000	Oh let me play this way. No you're done.
5983000	5985000	No no this is cool. The
5985000	5987000	writer of this. He did a movie of
5987000	5989000	Fanboys. He wrote the script and everything
5989000	5991000	for that. Oh god I've heard about. Okay.
5991000	5993000	I haven't seen that movie but I know what it is.
5993000	5995000	The guy. He drives around
5995000	5997000	in one of the cars
5997000	5999000	the avatar in this game
5999000	6001000	or this universe drives
6001000	6003000	around. It's not like a blue avatar.
6003000	6005000	No like he hits this
6005000	6007000	avatar in a virtual world type thing.
6007000	6009000	He drives around or flies
6009000	6011000	around I should say. And DeLorean
6011000	6013000	that has
6013000	6015000	something from Buckaroo Banzai where it allows
6015000	6017000	them to travel through matter. Also
6017000	6019000	has the Ecto-1
6019000	6021000	logos and stuff on it. Also has a light
6021000	6023000	bar from Knight Rider and Kittencider.
6023000	6025000	And this guy fucking drives around in
6025000	6027000	a goddamn DeLorean that has all that shit
6027000	6029000	on it. Well obviously not the time traveling
6029000	6031000	and the matter thing. But
6031000	6033000	he drives around a fucking DeLorean
6033000	6035000	with the kit and the light
6035000	6037000	bar and everything.
6037000	6039000	An actual car to all the book signings he goes to.
6039000	6041000	It's amazing. ActDeft once again wants to know
6041000	6043000	the name of the book. Ready Player One.
6043000	6045000	Alright just for you Loki. I will
6045000	6047000	try to get the author on the show. Why not?
6047000	6049000	Sure it's
6049000	6051000	amazing. It's a great book. Why not?
6051000	6053000	Alright. Moving on
6053000	6055000	I want to talk quickly
6055000	6057000	about this. A video game
6057000	6059000	soundtrack. But not your typical video game
6059000	6061000	soundtrack. It's a video game soundtrack by
6061000	6063000	the London Philharmonic Orchestra.
6063000	6065000	So this is pretty cool.
6065000	6067000	They're actually going to be putting out a
6067000	6069000	CD called The Greatest
6069000	6071000	Video Game Music. It will be
6071000	6073000	21 tracks with music that
6073000	6075000	encompasses like 30 years
6075000	6077000	worth of games. Super Mario,
6077000	6079000	Angry Birds, Metal Gear
6079000	6081000	Solid Sons of Liberty, Fallout 3.
6081000	6083000	Awesome. There's a
6083000	6085000	sample available online. It's
6085000	6087000	Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2
6087000	6089000	theme. And they actually have a clip of it
6089000	6091000	available on SoundCloud
6091000	6093000	that you can check out under username
6093000	6095000	kwahl. Let me play a quick little
6095000	6097000	clip here of
6097000	6099000	this. If I can kind of skip ahead in the song here a little bit.
6105000	6107000	I can't change the volume on this but usually these
6107000	6109000	classical songs are a little
6109000	6111000	quieter anyway.
6111000	6113000	You kind of get the feeling, right?
6113000	6115000	Here we go.
6121000	6123000	That's the London Philharmonic Orchestra doing that.
6123000	6125000	So that's going to be awesome.
6125000	6127000	Available wherever
6127000	6129000	you buy CDs. You know, Amazon, iTunes
6129000	6131000	what have you. Alright. Let's go
6131000	6133000	to the mailbag. Every week you guys send us
6133000	6135000	emails at mailbag at orangeloungelaunge
6135000	6137000	radio.com
6137000	6139000	Dark Soccer is going to read some of her favorites
6139000	6141000	right now. Mailbag at orangeloungelaunge radio.
6141000	6143000	All two of them. Two?
6143000	6145000	Yep. First one comes... I'm firing the
6145000	6147000	listeners. First one
6147000	6149000	comes from Ian. Hey guys, long
6149000	6151000	time listener, first time, I don't know, emailer
6151000	6153000	whatever. I'm not sure if
6153000	6155000	you guys knew about this or not but
6155000	6157000	over the DSiWare store
6157000	6159000	you can
6159000	6161000	I guess you can get, the word get was left
6161000	6163000	out. Legend of Zelda Four Swords Anniversary
6163000	6165000	Edition for free. Hells yes.
6165000	6167000	I'm not sure when it runs out but you better
6167000	6169000	act fast. Actually, I have an answer for that.
6169000	6171000	I was aware of that.
6171000	6173000	It's pretty big news in the DS world if you're a
6173000	6175000	3DS owner. And absolutely it's free.
6175000	6177000	You literally have no
6177000	6179000	reason not to get it. I haven't done it yet.
6179000	6181000	Unless you don't have the 3DS.
6181000	6183000	February is when it will not be
6183000	6185000	free anymore. So it won't be free forever.
6185000	6187000	I don't have a 3DS.
6187000	6189000	The good news is those of you that get them at the holidays
6189000	6191000	will, you know, which I imagine
6191000	6193000	a lot of people are going to find 3DS's
6193000	6195000	you know, under their Hanukkah tree or whatever it is
6195000	6197000	they will
6197000	6199000	you'll be able to still get it through February.
6199000	6201000	Next email?
6201000	6203000	Why not?
6203000	6205000	Hello peoples.
6205000	6207000	And this comes from Retertainment.
6207000	6209000	There's a story that broke
6209000	6211000	this week that just seemed to stick out my mind.
6211000	6213000	Why men are in trouble.
6213000	6215000	Okay, I'm going to click this.
6215000	6217000	Men are always in trouble.
6217000	6219000	Because we won't man up.
6219000	6221000	The reason that this story sticks in my mind
6221000	6223000	is because we pull out the popcorn too soon.
6223000	6225000	I don't know about you, but
6225000	6227000	I tend to tune out people who nag me to do things.
6227000	6229000	It seems that no matter who it is
6229000	6231000	or what it is about, whether they
6231000	6233000	or it is substantial or not
6233000	6235000	if you nag me, I tend not to pay attention.
6237000	6239000	I tend not to pay attention
6239000	6241000	to what you are currently saying
6241000	6243000	or what you have said and will say in the future.
6243000	6245000	So when William Bennett, President Obama
6245000	6247000	or my mom tells me to get off the video games
6247000	6249000	five hours a week, get yourself together
6249000	6251000	get a challenging job, or get married
6251000	6253000	I tend to put that in the bottom of my to-do list.
6253000	6255000	Stay black, Retertainment. This message was crafted
6255000	6257000	while watching a news podcast on my Apple TV.
6257000	6259000	That's just called having a rebellious nature.
6259000	6261000	You don't want to do
6261000	6263000	what someone tells you to do. Someone says
6263000	6265000	do it, you want to do something else.
6265000	6267000	That's actually very common. A lot of people
6267000	6269000	kind of have that rebellious nature.
6269000	6271000	Right? Well, I'm just
6271000	6273000	kind of glancing this over and...
6273000	6275000	Is this an opinion piece?
6275000	6277000	I noticed this on CNN. Yeah, I think it's an opinion piece.
6277000	6279000	By a dude.
6279000	6281000	It is. It's by a guy here.
6281000	6283000	Eh. Don't care.
6283000	6285000	Thank you. Thanks for your email.
6285000	6287000	I was trying to read over your shoulder.
6287000	6289000	Oh, you can get in the email and read it yourself.
6289000	6291000	I'll read it and be more educated.
6291000	6293000	Do I look like your correspondent?
6293000	6295000	Now who's nagging?
6295000	6297000	I'm not nagging.
6297000	6299000	It's written by a guy who's literally from the middle ages.
6299000	6301000	Oh, you read it?
6301000	6303000	Yeah, he's like, he's super duper...
6303000	6305000	Thank God someone's educated on this program.
6305000	6307000	He's so fucking old and he just like
6307000	6309000	he complains about all this stuff.
6309000	6311000	Back in my day!
6311000	6313000	No, I actually put a comment on my Facebook
6313000	6315000	if you want to link the article. I'm like, yeah, this article
6315000	6317000	is missing a lot of, back in my day
6317000	6319000	and get off my lawn. I mean, because seriously
6319000	6321000	that is what this is complaining about.
6321000	6323000	They need a medal. Those people need
6323000	6325000	to go to the military and fight for their
6325000	6327000	country and blah, blah, blah. This is the
6327000	6329000	problem with people. They sit at home and play
6329000	6331000	their Xbox instead of getting a job.
6331000	6333000	It's like, oh my
6333000	6335000	God. I mean, seriously.
6335000	6337000	Okay, well, how about this?
6337000	6339000	Okay, I'm going to put it this way. This is a military angle.
6339000	6341000	Now, would you go to work
6341000	6343000	for a place that you knew was in
6343000	6345000	debt and charging more debt?
6345000	6347000	This
6347000	6349000	is going to get political. I already know where you're going.
6349000	6351000	But I'm just saying, would you?
6351000	6353000	If they offered a great retirement plan, I might.
6353000	6355000	Touché.
6355000	6357000	Gotcha!
6357000	6359000	However, if the company was in
6359000	6361000	debt and started laying off people
6361000	6363000	before you could retire.
6363000	6365000	I think, logically,
6365000	6367000	any profession you go into, you would think
6367000	6369000	about the longevity of your job, absolutely.
6369000	6371000	So then why would it be a good idea
6371000	6373000	then to go into the military when
6373000	6375000	the entire, the last
6375000	6377000	couple of wars have been waged on
6377000	6379000	a visa?
6379000	6381000	He's
6381000	6383000	one of the people that's wrong with the problem.
6383000	6385000	He's probably one of the 1% too.
6385000	6387000	I don't want to say anything negative about people
6387000	6389000	that choose to go into the military because
6389000	6391000	it's a thankless job that
6391000	6393000	not everybody's brave enough to do.
6393000	6395000	No, that wasn't my point. I'm saying in response to this guy.
6395000	6397000	What makes it attractive
6397000	6399000	if, now I understand
6399000	6401000	going in for patriotic, that's one thing.
6401000	6403000	Or going in because, you know, it's a good option
6403000	6405000	right now. It's kind of a good,
6405000	6407000	to be fair, it's
6407000	6409000	a really good substitute for
6409000	6411000	school. I mean,
6411000	6413000	I know that sounds like really fucked up, but like
6413000	6415000	that real world experience, because people
6415000	6417000	do a lot in the military. Well, I even
6417000	6419000	considered going into the reserves
6419000	6421000	for the Air Force.
6421000	6423000	But the whole, the whole
6423000	6425000	thing is, is that he's bringing this up
6425000	6427000	but what he's not looking at is that
6427000	6429000	is there really going to be a future
6429000	6431000	for more people involved if they can't afford
6431000	6433000	to pay the people involved?
6433000	6435000	If we're just charging up more debt.
6435000	6437000	I think that this guy's one of the old schools
6437000	6439000	who's part of the problem.
6439000	6441000	You make it sound like though that we're paying back
6441000	6443000	the debt.
6443000	6445000	We can borrow as fucking much
6445000	6447000	money as we want. That's the problem.
6447000	6449000	That's the problem. They're not paying for
6449000	6451000	the debt because we're not having a raise in taxes.
6451000	6453000	We're not rationing,
6453000	6455000	we're not doing any of the stuff that they've done in past wars.
6455000	6457000	This world's going to hell in a
6457000	6459000	handbasket. I bet you anything would have
6459000	6461000	more jobs if there were, um,
6461000	6463000	if we were actually working to fund this stuff ourselves,
6463000	6465000	not outsourcing everything. Well,
6465000	6467000	that's a whole nother Oprah. I wasn't literally
6467000	6469000	saying though that he was telling people to go into the
6469000	6471000	military. I was just saying that he's, you know,
6471000	6473000	of the mind of like
6473000	6475000	old, old, old people. I know that mindset
6475000	6477000	though. Just like very stubborn.
6477000	6479000	He thinks, oh, it's a new thing. Therefore,
6479000	6481000	it's the cause of all problems. If it wasn't the comic books,
6481000	6483000	the rock music, the
6483000	6485000	drugs and more rock music,
6485000	6487000	I mean, or maybe rap music.
6487000	6489000	Um, yeah.
6489000	6491000	Wasn't it, and I'm
6491000	6493000	going to horribly misappropriate this
6493000	6495000	quote and hopefully not disrespect
6495000	6497000	somebody who recently deceased, but
6497000	6499000	wasn't even Steve Jobs who said
6499000	6501000	something about like drugs was
6501000	6503000	one of something that really like
6503000	6505000	the, like, like the one time he did it
6505000	6507000	was kind of like a life changing thing.
6507000	6509000	Not necessarily in like a negative way, but that
6509000	6511000	it was something that
6511000	6513000	I shouldn't have opened this box.
6513000	6515000	I tell you what, we would be missing
6515000	6517000	several classes. Not that I'm
6517000	6519000	condoning drugs. I'm not condoning drugs.
6519000	6521000	But I'm just saying, you know.
6521000	6523000	Keep in mind, think of how many
6523000	6525000	classic masterpieces would be missing if
6525000	6527000	not for Ebsynth. Sometimes
6527000	6529000	people who are a little rebellious
6529000	6531000	cause us to think a little
6531000	6533000	bit differently. I guess that's really my point.
6533000	6535000	That's, that's exactly it.
6535000	6537000	Think different, right? Touche.
6537000	6539000	Except that's bad grammar, and I can't
6539000	6541000	quote that. Shush. Alright.
6541000	6543000	Moving on. Uh,
6543000	6545000	that's it for the mailbag, huh? That's it. I said
6545000	6547000	this too. I guess that, this would be a, well, I
6547000	6549000	wasn't listening, because all I was hearing was
6549000	6551000	nagging.
6551000	6553000	Rob. Rob. Rob.
6553000	6555000	What a good opportunity to go to the FUs
6555000	6557000	of the week.
6557000	6559000	What?
6587000	6589000	And the whole market
6589000	6591000	thing is really coming back
6591000	6593000	to, it's really, and I told you
6593000	6595000	guys before the show, but it's really
6595000	6597000	playing a personal role in my life
6597000	6599000	and it's
6599000	6601000	ridiculous. And, uh,
6601000	6603000	I really want to
6603000	6605000	give a big FU to people
6605000	6607000	who try to argue
6607000	6609000	against
6609000	6611000	something that they don't believe in
6611000	6613000	by using, um,
6613000	6615000	fallacious arguments.
6615000	6617000	Like, number one. But using
6617000	6619000	fallacious is okay. That's fine.
6619000	6621000	But you know what I mean.
6621000	6623000	Like, trying to discredit the person
6623000	6625000	talking about something by saying that,
6625000	6627000	you know, by trying to insult
6627000	6629000	them, or by using
6629000	6631000	you know, sensationalist
6631000	6633000	words or trying to show that
6633000	6635000	you know, an issue is
6635000	6637000	skyrocketing, or throwing
6637000	6639000	someone off the path to try
6639000	6641000	to make themselves seem like they know what the hell they're talking
6641000	6643000	about when they really don't.
6643000	6645000	You know, if you don't know
6645000	6647000	if you feel a certain way just
6647000	6649000	because you feel that way
6649000	6651000	or, you know, you have
6651000	6653000	an opinion based on a feeling,
6653000	6655000	just say that. But if you don't have facts to support
6655000	6657000	it, don't inject your shit where
6657000	6659000	you don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
6659000	6661000	The end.
6661000	6663000	Loki!
6663000	6665000	Fuck you to, uh,
6665000	6667000	being invited to
6667000	6669000	the Saintsboro Hollywood
6669000	6671000	pre-launch event the day before
6671000	6673000	it happens, and yeah, it's
6673000	6675000	just kind of hard to
6675000	6677000	justify paying $400 for a
6677000	6679000	goddamn ticket or driving, you know, a total
6679000	6681000	of like 12 hours to and back
6681000	6683000	from LA to go play Saintsboro
6683000	6685000	for three hours. I would have been in the car.
6685000	6687000	I don't know, Loki.
6687000	6689000	Yeah, but see, I have a wife to contend with
6689000	6691000	as well. Yeah, that's true, that's true. Um, but, you know,
6691000	6693000	hey, if they were going to fly me down or something like that,
6693000	6695000	that's cool. But see, here's the thing, it's like
6695000	6697000	not that I would really want to rub elbows with
6697000	6699000	you know, Lindsay Lohan or anything like that
6699000	6701000	down there, but they had
6701000	6703000	a bunch of people, you know,
6703000	6705000	all the photos are people, you know,
6705000	6707000	taking in the free alcohol and
6707000	6709000	taking pictures and dancing and stuff like that, but no one
6709000	6711000	fucking playing the goddamn game was like
6711000	6713000	God damn it, they're playing the game!
6713000	6715000	I was like
6715000	6717000	all you people don't give a shit. Lindsay Lohan
6717000	6719000	doesn't even fucking know what Saintsboro is.
6719000	6721000	She was really there.
6721000	6723000	Was that the one where they got the picture? Yes, it was the one
6723000	6725000	right there. That is the one.
6725000	6727000	That is the event that she was at.
6727000	6729000	I don't know what the fuck Saintsboro is.
6729000	6731000	They're paying her to be there. She's just like, somebody gives a shit
6731000	6733000	about me? I'm so there.
6733000	6735000	They had, what was it, they had one of the
6735000	6737000	Kardashians or something there, but not
6737000	6739000	any of the famous ones or something.
6739000	6741000	I don't remember who it was, like Rob Kardashian
6741000	6743000	or something. Isn't he the one
6743000	6745000	that's on Dancing with the Stars? Yeah. Who was?
6745000	6747000	I don't know who the fuck he is. But, uh,
6747000	6749000	you know, it's just like all these people, like, I wouldn't
6749000	6751000	know who the hell they are. And then they're like,
6751000	6753000	so, but, my guy at KHQ
6753000	6755000	is awesome though, for at least sending me the invite,
6755000	6757000	you know, I was like, he's like, I just found out about this
6757000	6759000	yesterday, and I'm like,
6759000	6761000	yep, pretty much can't go there, so,
6761000	6763000	well, but I keep
6763000	6765000	tabs with them to see if there's something in San Francisco.
6765000	6767000	I gotta say, I'm fortunate in that,
6767000	6769000	you know, if something were to come up,
6769000	6771000	like, let's say, BlizzCon's coming up
6771000	6773000	this weekend, and like, if I could somehow swing it
6773000	6775000	with my work, or even if I couldn't, like,
6775000	6777000	if the event was on a Saturday, I'd be in the
6777000	6779000	car Friday night. No, I
6779000	6781000	would've- Allen would be like, can you take me with you?
6781000	6783000	I, I seriously, well, the only
6783000	6785000	reason I know is $400, because I looked at prices
6785000	6787000	and tickets, and it just, it was not gonna happen
6787000	6789000	even, even if I was able
6789000	6791000	to pay for that, the flights just went-
6791000	6793000	You got a family to think about now. And the flights just didn't
6793000	6795000	jive, and you would've had to, I would've
6795000	6797000	had to drive 12 hours for the playoff, 3 hours
6797000	6799000	worth of a game is coming out in a few weeks, I mean,
6799000	6801000	I would normally
6801000	6803000	do that, if, you know, I had no restrictions,
6803000	6805000	but, I, you know,
6805000	6807000	I'm not, I don't make
6807000	6809000	enough for $400, I can just
6809000	6811000	blow away.
6811000	6813000	Alright, fair enough. Um, my FU of the week,
6813000	6815000	I, I don't have a lot of serious stuff.
6815000	6817000	Things are going relatively well, all things considered.
6817000	6819000	So, FU to, um,
6819000	6821000	I would say FU to the traffic up in Apple
6821000	6823000	Hill yesterday. Like,
6823000	6825000	in the fact that all of the roads up there are only one lane
6825000	6827000	with stop signs. I mean, I get that it's supposed to be
6827000	6829000	all rural and country, but, there comes a
6829000	6831000	point where you just admit you need to build
6831000	6833000	a better off-ramp.
6833000	6835000	That's it.
6835000	6837000	Uh, moving on to a couple more
6837000	6839000	news stories for you guys, and then, of course, Twitter
6839000	6841000	topics in the Skype line very, very soon.
6841000	6843000	Loki. Uh, this is kind of exciting.
6843000	6845000	Not in the way you probably think, though.
6845000	6847000	Um, Grand Theft Auto 3 is
6847000	6849000	having its 10th anniversary.
6849000	6851000	So, Rockstar is celebrating
6851000	6853000	by porting it to the iOS
6853000	6855000	platform. Uh, this would actually
6855000	6857000	be the new iOS stuff.
6857000	6859000	The iPad 2 and iPhone 4S
6859000	6861000	are gonna be the only devices that are
6861000	6863000	supporting it, at least on the Apple end. Android
6863000	6865000	phones are also getting it, uh, Droid X2
6865000	6867000	HTC Evo 2.
6867000	6869000	LG Optimus 2X, uh,
6869000	6871000	Motorola Atrix, and Samsung
6871000	6873000	Galaxy S2, as well as
6873000	6875000	Android tablets, Acer, uh, Icona,
6875000	6877000	um, the Asus E Pad,
6877000	6879000	Motorola XOOM, and Samsung Galaxy
6879000	6881000	Tab 10.1.
6881000	6883000	Um, so, that game's
6883000	6885000	gonna be ported there in HD graphics
6885000	6887000	and stuff like that, of course, you know, some
6887000	6889000	unique gameplay stuff there, but,
6889000	6891000	I don't know, I think it'd be pretty hard to play
6891000	6893000	on a, uh, system. I'm just excited
6893000	6895000	about the fact that they're doing that, cause that means
6895000	6897000	that, you know,
6897000	6899000	sooner or later this is coming to
6899000	6901000	Xbox Live Arcade and Playstation Network, I mean,
6901000	6903000	come on, they're putting in the work to do it now,
6903000	6905000	they're gonna do it. And,
6905000	6907000	once this comes, then Vice City and then
6907000	6909000	San Andreas, and that's just gonna be amazing.
6909000	6911000	Um, one other ridiculous
6911000	6913000	thing though that they're having is they're having a 1-6
6913000	6915000	scale, uh, action figure you can
6915000	6917000	buy, uh, Claude
6917000	6919000	from the, uh, hero, I guess
6919000	6921000	of the first game, and of course,
6921000	6923000	comes with outfits and guns and stuff like that,
6923000	6925000	for a hundred and fucking fifty dollars.
6925000	6927000	Not worth it, but, uh,
6927000	6929000	if you're a really big fan, and I'm a huge
6929000	6931000	fan of Grand Theft Auto, but I'm not paying
6931000	6933000	a hundred and fifty dollars for a fucking toy.
6933000	6935000	No.
6935000	6937000	So.
6937000	6939000	Oh well. It looks neat though.
6941000	6943000	Uh, yeah.
6943000	6945000	I, I guess, uh,
6945000	6947000	any extra money they can get out of that
6947000	6949000	franchise, they will, right?
6949000	6951000	Uh, exactly. Um, I, I would
6951000	6953000	be, I would love to play the game. Apparently
6953000	6955000	though, they're gonna be porting the game later on to
6955000	6957000	other, um, platforms, you know, like the
6957000	6959000	just the regular iPhone 4 and stuff like that,
6959000	6961000	but it's not gonna be as pretty.
6961000	6963000	Um,
6963000	6965000	and it, I do think that, uh, it does
6965000	6967000	support some of the blue, uh,
6967000	6969000	maybe some of the Bluetooth controllers and stuff like that,
6969000	6971000	so that'd be kinda cool to actually play with buttons, but
6971000	6973000	I really just want it to come to
6973000	6975000	Xbox Live Arcade. Really, I would just say
6975000	6977000	skip 3 and Vice City, just,
6977000	6979000	just bring San Andreas. San Andreas
6979000	6981000	multiplayer, you don't even need to put out a grand theft of
6981000	6983000	five anytime soon. People would eat
6983000	6985000	that up. Alright.
6985000	6987000	Uh, moving on to Apple
6987000	6989000	related news, other iOS news,
6989000	6991000	uh, this has to do with Game Center,
6991000	6993000	which got some minor upgrades in the whole
6993000	6995000	iOS 5 thing, uh, but nothing
6995000	6997000	really to scream about. I mean, yay, it
6997000	6999000	shows you your total achievement points now in comparison
6999000	7001000	to others, and you can have your own little
7001000	7003000	picture. Whoopee. But
7003000	7005000	you gotta wonder if maybe there was other
7005000	7007000	stuff that was supposed to come, because some patents
7007000	7009000	that Apple had filed, uh, was talking about
7009000	7011000	avatars, uh, little avatars
7011000	7013000	on Game Centers, you know, where you could, like, have little hats
7013000	7015000	and hair, pretty much the exact same thing,
7015000	7017000	you know, with the, uh, Xbox avatars, and the,
7017000	7019000	the me's on the Wii.
7019000	7021000	Uh, that is apparently something that Apple
7021000	7023000	was, or is looking at
7023000	7025000	for Game Center. Uh, the patents were originally
7025000	7027000	filed in April,
7027000	7029000	but obviously we didn't see this in
7029000	7031000	iOS 5, so either it was scrapped, or
7031000	7033000	who knows. Uh... You know what those remind me of?
7033000	7035000	They remind me of the little figures,
7035000	7037000	or the characters from, uh, Tiny Tower.
7037000	7039000	Oh, kinda,
7039000	7041000	yeah, cause Tiny Tower kinda has that thing going on
7041000	7043000	with it, but, um, I, I gotta say
7043000	7045000	honestly, this is just, okay,
7045000	7047000	it's just another version of the me, you know,
7047000	7049000	avatar somewhere else, woohoo.
7049000	7051000	So, whatever. Game Center's
7051000	7053000	kind of, uh, I don't know, there's
7053000	7055000	just not, not a lot to get excited about
7055000	7057000	with Game Center. I mean, I get that Apple's
7057000	7059000	kinda trying to, like, like, standardize
7059000	7061000	things, but you look at what's going on with things
7061000	7063000	like Open Feint, and you're kinda like, wow,
7063000	7065000	there's, they seem to be pushing the envelope a lot
7065000	7067000	faster, and doing other, you know,
7067000	7069000	exciting things with it, but the problem with Open Feint
7069000	7071000	is that, because it's not
7071000	7073000	tied into the iOS, it kinda
7073000	7075000	sometimes can get in the way, and is distracting,
7075000	7077000	and a lot of games really push it, when you're like,
7077000	7079000	you know what, I'm just, I'm not interested in all that.
7079000	7081000	So, I don't know.
7081000	7083000	This is something I've noticed amongst my iOS gaming.
7083000	7085000	Alright,
7085000	7087000	DarkSakura, what do you got for us?
7087000	7089000	We have a few things, well,
7089000	7091000	really just one thing, but it has to do with, uh,
7091000	7093000	Eve Online. There is, um,
7093000	7095000	an offer going out
7095000	7097000	for lapsed Eve Online
7097000	7099000	users to save money.
7099000	7101000	So basically, if they reactivate
7101000	7103000	their account, um,
7103000	7105000	they pay $4.95 for 30 days
7105000	7107000	instead of $14.95.
7107000	7109000	So, I guess
7109000	7111000	it's just to get people back in for
7111000	7113000	that month and see if it keeps them hooked.
7115000	7117000	It's very interesting.
7117000	7119000	Well, I'm sure when
7119000	7121000	there's all these other MMOs going on,
7121000	7123000	you know, and of course, launches coming up
7123000	7125000	like Star Wars and so forth,
7125000	7127000	you know, these aging
7127000	7129000	MMOs have to do everything they can to kind of get
7129000	7131000	people to look at it again,
7131000	7133000	you know. Yeah. But of course, Eve has
7133000	7135000	that whole spin-off coming to the PlayStation 3
7135000	7137000	they were talking about at E3. That's true.
7137000	7139000	So, that is right there. It's probably gonna get
7139000	7141000	a lot of people kind of looking back at Eve, I'm sure.
7141000	7143000	Possibly.
7143000	7145000	So, Sony is apparently looking for,
7145000	7147000	um, or possibly
7147000	7149000	mulling around, if you will,
7149000	7151000	an idea where people
7151000	7153000	can actually
7153000	7155000	get a discount on purchasing
7155000	7157000	UMD games
7157000	7159000	on the Vita
7159000	7161000	if you currently own the actual
7161000	7163000	UMD game.
7163000	7165000	This is coming from the Japanese language fact
7165000	7167000	that's posted, I guess,
7167000	7169000	on Sony's PlayStation website.
7169000	7171000	They're saying that the fact
7171000	7173000	notes that they're considering a service to offer
7173000	7175000	PSN versions of UMD games
7175000	7177000	users
7177000	7179000	own for a special price. This is in
7179000	7181000	the confirmation, obviously, but
7181000	7183000	it's something that they're considering details
7183000	7185000	of the service will be announced later.
7185000	7187000	I don't know how the hell they're gonna be able to do that, but
7187000	7189000	maybe you have to pop it in your
7189000	7191000	PSP and it
7191000	7193000	recognizes it's there or something like that.
7193000	7195000	I don't know how that really
7195000	7197000	works, but, uh,
7197000	7199000	yeah. It says, I guess,
7199000	7201000	also it says that the Vita will
7201000	7203000	play all downloadable PSP games
7203000	7205000	except for game
7205000	7207000	archives, which I guess
7207000	7209000	is, um, the
7209000	7211000	Japanese label for the PlayStation
7211000	7213000	1 classics, Neo Geo games,
7213000	7215000	and retro downloads.
7215000	7217000	So, you're not gonna be able to
7217000	7219000	play your PlayStation 1 games, I guess.
7219000	7221000	But maybe they're gonna have a
7221000	7223000	different way to play them later on or something.
7225000	7227000	Oh well. That's too bad.
7227000	7229000	Uh, not surprising,
7229000	7231000	though. Well, it's hard to
7231000	7233000	port out the backwards, you know.
7233000	7235000	It's akin to the whole PlayStation 2 games that are now
7235000	7237000	showing up on PlayStation 3. You know, I don't know.
7237000	7239000	It's kinda what it reminds me of.
7239000	7241000	Alright, one more story for you guys.
7241000	7243000	Then we're gonna open up the Skype line at
7243000	7245000	1877 Game OLR or a username on Skype,
7245000	7247000	Orange Lounge Radio, and this has to do with
7247000	7249000	the game in the world of South
7249000	7251000	Park. You know, South Park gets these games
7251000	7253000	once in a while. In fact, they had an Xbox Live arcade
7253000	7255000	game. It was the Tower Defense game, and I
7255000	7257000	can't remember the name of it. Let's Go Tower Defense
7257000	7259000	Play. That was it. Uh, that was out,
7259000	7261000	what, about two years ago? Well, a
7261000	7263000	new South Park game was announced for Xbox
7263000	7265000	Live Arcade. It's supposed to be coming out next spring.
7265000	7267000	It's called South Park, Tenorman's
7267000	7269000	Revenge. Do you remember
7269000	7271000	Scott Tenorman? That was the character
7271000	7273000	where his parents were chopped up, and
7273000	7275000	Cartman fed the parents
7275000	7277000	in the chili to Scott Tenorman. That was one of
7277000	7279000	the most fucked up episodes of
7279000	7281000	South Park that there was. What was the play on
7281000	7283000	Titus, right? One of
7283000	7285000	those movies that had come out around
7285000	7287000	the same time, and it was
7287000	7289000	one of those so sick
7289000	7291000	it was funny. Yeah.
7291000	7293000	Anyhow,
7293000	7295000	I guess it was being shown
7295000	7297000	at Comic Con, and some
7297000	7299000	screenshots have come out of it.
7299000	7301000	It looks like it might be a little more of a platformer.
7301000	7303000	They have a trailer for it. It's actually
7303000	7305000	pretty cool looking. And ManBearPig is in it.
7305000	7307000	Oh, is there a trailer? There is a trailer for it.
7307000	7309000	Let me find it.
7309000	7311000	It was pretty
7311000	7313000	cool looking. It looks like a
7313000	7315000	four player side-scroller
7315000	7317000	game. Okay, here we go.
7317000	7319000	Got a trailer here. Let's take a look.
7327000	7329000	Is he building a robot? Oh, I see.
7341000	7343000	Begin ginger vacation.
7343000	7345000	Nice.
7351000	7353000	There's some gameplay.
7353000	7355000	It looks like it might be four player simultaneous.
7355000	7357000	Yeah. It's kind of what it looks like.
7357000	7359000	You can play as the goon.
7361000	7363000	That might be cute. A lot of those
7363000	7365000	South Park games are kind of dopey.
7365000	7367000	God, there was one that was especially
7367000	7369000	terrible. What was it on? I want to
7369000	7371000	say it was on the Nintendo 64.
7371000	7373000	It was some South Park kart racing game.
7373000	7375000	Not even that. That was pretty bad too.
7375000	7377000	There was like a first person shooter game.
7377000	7379000	It wasn't a kart racing game. It was a first person shooter.
7379000	7381000	It was really, it was a special kind of terrible.
7381000	7383000	Like, it was
7383000	7385000	really bad.
7385000	7387000	So yeah, hopefully it's better than that.
7387000	7389000	Alright.
7389000	7391000	Oh, even TigerClaw in our chatroom at chat.ornsauceready.com
7391000	7393000	just brought that game up.
7393000	7395000	The N64 game and Rama's like, I remember that.
7395000	7397000	Yeah, I'd like to forget that that ever happened.
7397000	7399000	Thanks.
7399000	7401000	Alright, Skype line is open. 1-877-GAME-OLR
7401000	7403000	or our username on Skype is
7403000	7405000	OrangeLoungeRadio if you want to give us a call.
7405000	7407000	Talk about anything that we've talked about tonight
7407000	7409000	so far on the show or maybe something that we
7409000	7411000	missed that you were hoping we would talk about.
7411000	7413000	I don't know. Meanwhile, going to
7413000	7415000	some Twitter topics.
7415000	7417000	Which I'm signed into the wrong account.
7417000	7419000	I was about to read tweets that were sent to me.
7419000	7421000	Not to the show.
7421000	7423000	Oh Rob, you're being a diva.
7423000	7425000	Are you reading my mother's Twitter?
7425000	7429000	No.
7429000	7431000	Alright.
7431000	7433000	Going to some tweets. We have a couple tweets here
7433000	7435000	from TigerClaw305. He always likes to
7435000	7437000	tweet us some stories that
7437000	7439000	otherwise might slip through the cracks.
7439000	7441000	The first one that he tweeted us is about a
7441000	7443000	Spider-Man video game. The Amazing Spider-Man
7443000	7445000	video game coming in 2012.
7445000	7447000	It's supposed to be open world.
7447000	7449000	And I guess there's teaser posters all over New York Comic-Con
7449000	7451000	about it. Obviously the new movie
7451000	7453000	because they're rebooting the franchise
7453000	7455000	that wasn't that dead. But whatever.
7455000	7457000	They're rebooting it in 2012.
7457000	7459000	So that's on it's way. They also have a trailer for that too.
7459000	7461000	Is there really? Let me see if we can
7461000	7463000	find. Well, hold on. Because we're getting a call.
7463000	7465000	I'll look for a trailer for this
7465000	7467000	while we take our call. But we do have
7467000	7469000	a call coming in. So let's go do it. Hi, you're on
7469000	7471000	Orange Launch Radio. Who's this? Hey, it's DJ
7471000	7473000	Ron Mess from Anime Jam Session. How are you
7473000	7475000	guys doing tonight? I am Fantastic Rama.
7475000	7477000	How are you doing?
7477000	7479000	I am tired. I am sitting
7479000	7481000	here pouring over photos,
7481000	7483000	pouring over videos, and sipping
7483000	7485000	my spiked apple juice.
7485000	7487000	Now you were at New York Comic-Con
7487000	7489000	this weekend, right? Yes, I was.
7489000	7491000	All four days. And are you working on your Fernando
7491000	7493000	cosplay?
7493000	7495000	No. And screw you
7495000	7497000	Loki. No. No.
7497000	7499000	No. No.
7499000	7501000	Alright. You know we
7501000	7503000	just gotta give you a hard time.
7503000	7505000	Besides, I have a Buddha belly so that ain't
7505000	7507000	happening anytime soon. Alright.
7507000	7509000	Well, how was the con? Tell us about
7509000	7511000	it. Okay, first, I gotta ask. Did you play
7511000	7513000	Bungee Ferret Tossing? Yes.
7513000	7515000	Yes, I did. And, um, we do
7515000	7517000	have a demo video
7517000	7519000	up. Woohoo!
7519000	7521000	And I just posted it in the chat
7521000	7523000	room. Was this blessed by YYR?
7523000	7525000	Yes. Yes, it was.
7525000	7527000	Okay, just making sure. Alright. Plus, I am
7527000	7529000	also press so, you know.
7529000	7531000	Oh, I see. Oh, you're a press.
7531000	7533000	Oh yeah, because you're Anime Jam Session.
7533000	7535000	Alright, let's see what this is.
7535000	7537000	Action.
7537000	7539000	Okay, first off, you wanna cut out
7539000	7541000	the guy that says action. You do know that, right?
7541000	7543000	You do realize I'm up
7543000	7545000	here rushing trying to get the video
7545000	7547000	online. Alright, alright,
7547000	7549000	alright. I love the poster in the background
7549000	7551000	too. How long is your snake?
7551000	7553000	That's also, he also
7553000	7555000	has it as a shirt. Clever.
7555000	7557000	Clever. We're going to check
7557000	7559000	out OLR's exclusive game
7559000	7561000	Bungee Ferret Tossing.
7561000	7563000	Were
7563000	7565000	you playing this in a hardboat?
7565000	7567000	Oh, we're watching it.
7571000	7573000	And so you're
7573000	7575000	kind of moving around on the helicopter. It doesn't look like
7575000	7577000	things are going too crazy on the ground right now.
7577000	7579000	Oh, there are the ferrets.
7579000	7581000	It's kind of interesting
7581000	7583000	this strikes me as like a
7583000	7585000	mix between like a twin stick shooter
7585000	7587000	like Geometry Wars where you're trying to dodge
7587000	7589000	all the bullets. But yet
7589000	7591000	it's a whole different
7591000	7593000	element. Like you don't shoot the same way.
7593000	7595000	It's like this mixture of
7595000	7597000	defender and Geometry Wars.
7601000	7603000	We can't fix the chopper in battle
7603000	7605000	so be careful. Now the blood
7605000	7607000	splats aren't really coming through very well on this
7607000	7609000	video but still.
7611000	7613000	Nice. Triple.
7615000	7617000	Very cool. Tell us
7617000	7619000	a little more. You can see the ground is all bloody. That's awesome.
7619000	7621000	Tell us a little more while we
7621000	7623000	watch the rest of this game play
7623000	7625000	video here.
7625000	7627000	I have to say that is one of the most bloodiest
7627000	7629000	8-bit style video games I
7629000	7631000	have played in a very long
7631000	7633000	time. Which is a good thing. If it has our
7633000	7635000	name on it, it better.
7637000	7639000	Awesome.
7639000	7641000	What else did you see in New York Comic Con?
7641000	7643000	Some other stuff but before I continue
7643000	7645000	if you notice
7645000	7647000	the ferret that
7647000	7649000	Fernando is tossing looks familiar
7649000	7651000	if you follow Naruto.
7651000	7653000	Really? Oh is it?
7653000	7655000	That is hers isn't it?
7655000	7657000	Yes it is. Awesome.
7657000	7659000	Well of course
7659000	7661000	it's a video game.
7661000	7663000	There's got to be a Naruto reference in it at someplace.
7663000	7665000	But there's a kill counter.
7665000	7667000	You killed
7667000	7669000	21 terrorists. Oh 22.
7669000	7671000	Nice.
7671000	7673000	And a few ninjas. What else did you
7673000	7675000	see at the con over 4 days?
7675000	7677000	Final Fantasy 13 2.
7677000	7679000	Oh nice. How was that?
7679000	7681000	You can jump in this game.
7681000	7683000	It's about freaking
7683000	7685000	time.
7685000	7687000	I thought Square Enix didn't know how
7687000	7689000	to handle jumping.
7689000	7691000	I played the
7691000	7693000	demo. It was pretty fun
7693000	7695000	and I hate to say it
7695000	7697000	I am not saying this as a
7697000	7699000	360 fanboy. But they did
7699000	7701000	have the 360 and the
7701000	7703000	PS3 versions both sitting
7703000	7705000	on display. Same model
7705000	7707000	TVs. And looks like
7707000	7709000	the graphics in the 360 version
7709000	7711000	looks a little bit sharper. A little bit crisper.
7711000	7713000	Interesting. Because usually
7713000	7715000	you would think with the whole Blu-ray stuff that it
7715000	7717000	would look a little better on the Playstation 3.
7717000	7719000	Pretty much. And I was kind of shocked
7719000	7721000	by that. Very interesting.
7721000	7723000	What else?
7723000	7725000	Any other games that you got your hands on while you were
7725000	7727000	out there? Like maybe Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom
7727000	7729000	or whatever else they were showing there?
7729000	7731000	I could not get on the line for that.
7731000	7733000	And one of my staffers who was covering
7733000	7735000	games, he got sick over the weekend
7735000	7737000	so he could not finish up all the game coverage.
7737000	7739000	Oh no.
7739000	7741000	But here's something interesting.
7741000	7743000	Now, I've
7743000	7745000	ran into some friends of mine and they're
7745000	7747000	all dressed as characters from
7747000	7749000	Mega Man Legends. Right. Oh boy.
7749000	7751000	They actually went to the Capcom
7751000	7753000	booth and protested them
7753000	7755000	canceling Mega Man Legends 3.
7755000	7757000	They should have
7757000	7759000	occupied Capcom. Yeah, occupied
7759000	7761000	Capcom. Is that what was going
7761000	7763000	on? One of them
7763000	7765000	actually had a sign. I might have taken a picture
7765000	7767000	of it. Occupied Capcom. Nice.
7767000	7769000	We are the 99%
7769000	7771000	of gamers that want a new Mega Man game.
7771000	7773000	Nice.
7773000	7775000	And they're all walking around
7775000	7777000	the convention center trying to
7777000	7779000	get people to follow
7779000	7781000	with them. And I saw one of them
7781000	7783000	and I said, you do realize
7783000	7785000	it's not going to happen, right?
7785000	7787000	And they're like, you shut up, it'll
7787000	7789000	happen! And I'm like, sure it will.
7789000	7791000	Sure it will.
7791000	7793000	It's going to be a lot harder once
7793000	7795000	certain individuals have left
7795000	7797000	Capcom, but okay, okay.
7797000	7799000	Yeah, pretty much. Nice.
7799000	7801000	But they didn't get thrown out of the booth?
7801000	7803000	No, not at all. That's good.
7803000	7805000	I was thinking maybe there was going to be some drama,
7805000	7807000	some throw down, some cops called.
7807000	7809000	No, no, no.
7809000	7811000	We were too far away
7811000	7813000	from that. I see, I see.
7813000	7815000	Alright.
7815000	7817000	Well, I don't know what else to ask you about the con.
7817000	7819000	Anything else you want to share with us tonight?
7819000	7821000	Uh, let's see.
7821000	7823000	Well,
7823000	7825000	I would say
7825000	7827000	cosplays. The most popular
7827000	7829000	gaming cosplay I saw this weekend
7829000	7831000	was pretty much
7831000	7833000	Link, Mario,
7833000	7835000	and Peach.
7835000	7837000	So just kind of your traditional Nintendo
7837000	7839000	characters. Very traditional.
7839000	7841000	Yeah.
7841000	7843000	Also, there's this one guy, he cosplays
7843000	7845000	the red trainer from
7845000	7847000	Pokemon. He actually was walking
7847000	7849000	around the convention center with his
7849000	7851000	bike playing the Pokemon theme
7851000	7853000	as you're walking through as you're playing the game.
7853000	7855000	That background music. Oh my god.
7855000	7857000	Nice. I thought that was pretty
7857000	7859000	cool. Sounds pretty intricate to me.
7859000	7861000	Eh, he's one step
7861000	7863000	up. I would be too lazy to do something
7863000	7865000	like that.
7865000	7867000	At least you're honest.
7867000	7869000	Pretty much. Alright my friend, well do you have anything else
7869000	7871000	you want to share with us tonight before I let you go?
7871000	7873000	Uh, not now,
7873000	7875000	but I think I'm waiting
7875000	7877000	on a response from somebody
7877000	7879000	to hear some other interesting information. As soon as I hear it,
7879000	7881000	you'll be the first to know. Alright.
7881000	7883000	Hmm. Interesting. Alright. Keep me posted.
7883000	7885000	Will do. Alright. Later buddy.
7885000	7887000	You got it bro.
7887000	7889000	1877 Game OLR. Our username
7889000	7891000	on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio if you
7891000	7893000	want to give us a call. I'm very appreciative of
7893000	7895000	the video of Bungee Ferret Tossing since we weren't
7895000	7897000	there to play it. I'm excited that
7897000	7899000	it's only going to be a dollar.
7899000	7901000	That's a bargain price for a game.
7901000	7903000	I love that YYR is doing that.
7903000	7905000	Really is a labor of love for the craft
7905000	7907000	of creating games. That's awesome.
7907000	7909000	Back to the Twitter at Twitter.com
7909000	7911000	slash OLR. Another tweet
7911000	7913000	coming to us from Tigerclaw
7913000	7915000	who links us to this article on
7915000	7917000	Gamasutra
7917000	7919000	about a mobile game
7919000	7921000	that promotes social network safety
7921000	7923000	for children. I thought we had something similar
7923000	7925000	to this last week, but I don't think it's quite the same thing.
7925000	7927000	Because I think this one is now an iOS
7927000	7929000	game that's coming out and it's
7929000	7931000	about Be Seen, which is like a
7931000	7933000	network. And I guess it's like telling people
7933000	7935000	not to share all their personal
7935000	7937000	shit online.
7937000	7939000	You know what I mean?
7939000	7941000	You know, because some kids don't really know better.
7941000	7943000	Right? So
7943000	7945000	you got to teach them how to handle
7945000	7947000	social networking appropriately.
7947000	7949000	So.
7949000	7951000	Alright. Let's go to another call.
7951000	7953000	We're getting more calls on the line here, so we'll go to another one.
7953000	7955000	Hi, you're on Orange Challenge Radio. Who's this?
7955000	7957000	Hey, it's CD Thunder. Hey, CD Thunder.
7957000	7959000	What's on your mind, buddy?
7959000	7961000	Not much. I have a couple of things I'd like to talk about.
7961000	7963000	Alright. What's up?
7963000	7965000	Well, I went to the
7965000	7967000	mall today and there's an arcade
7967000	7969000	game that I just couldn't stop playing. I was like,
7969000	7971000	oh, man, this is so good.
7971000	7973000	I got to keep playing. You know what I mean?
7973000	7975000	Yeah, of course. What game is that?
7975000	7977000	I'm not sure if you've heard of it. It's called Paradise
7977000	7979000	Lost.
7979000	7981000	I don't think I have heard of that. Tell me the
7981000	7983000	set up for this.
7983000	7985000	It's basically you're
7985000	7987000	the survivor on an island
7987000	7989000	and you go from gun to gun
7989000	7991000	and just mowing down all these guys.
7991000	7993000	That's
7993000	7995000	all you pretty much do. And then you
7995000	7997000	get these different bosses, like helicopters
7997000	7999000	and stuff.
7999000	8001000	So it's
8001000	8003000	pretty basic. But there's one
8003000	8005000	boss that's called the Chucker and it's this
8005000	8007000	mutant looking thing that
8007000	8009000	just throws
8009000	8011000	exploding barrels at you. I'm finding
8011000	8013000	that this is apparently Paradise Lost
8013000	8015000	is a arcade version
8015000	8017000	of the series Far Cry
8017000	8019000	and specifically Far Cry Instincts.
8019000	8021000	So now the way you're describing the game kind of
8021000	8023000	makes a lot of sense. So this is some type
8023000	8025000	of like port to it, I guess.
8025000	8027000	It's a rail shooter arcade game port
8027000	8029000	of Far Cry Instincts and
8029000	8031000	it was made in 2007
8031000	8033000	and I guess it uses hardware very similar
8033000	8035000	to Aliens Extermination. So
8035000	8037000	kind of neat.
8037000	8039000	Well, it would be kind of cool if
8039000	8041000	they actually put Paradise Lost on the Wii
8041000	8043000	or some other system because
8043000	8045000	it's just a lot of fun.
8045000	8047000	It's very addicting. Well, just so you know,
8047000	8049000	if you do really like the game, you might want to check out the
8049000	8051000	Far Cry series. Far Cry Instincts was on
8051000	8053000	the original Xbox, not the 360
8053000	8055000	but the old, old Xbox.
8055000	8057000	It was actually made in like 2005.
8057000	8059000	So if you like those type of games, you know, you
8059000	8061000	like that, you might enjoy the Far Cry series
8061000	8063000	which, you know, they're still making
8063000	8065000	those games. Like Far Cry 3 is
8065000	8067000	coming out
8067000	8069000	next year. I don't think it's out
8069000	8071000	yet. No, it's definitely not out yet but it's coming
8071000	8073000	out soon. Wasn't that the one they were showing the
8073000	8075000	big trailer for and it was like really
8075000	8077000	creepster looking. They kicked the guy down the
8077000	8079000	cave. Was that Far Cry? Or am I mixing it up
8079000	8081000	with another series? I think it was.
8081000	8083000	I think it was.
8083000	8085000	I don't know off hand. Anyway, sorry
8085000	8087000	CD Thunder, don't mean to digress. What else did you
8087000	8089000	check out?
8089000	8091000	That was the only arcade game that
8091000	8093000	I want to talk about but
8093000	8095000	the next thing I'd like to discuss is what
8095000	8097000	I think would make a really good game.
8097000	8099000	Alrighty.
8099000	8101000	I'm not sure if you agree with me on this but
8101000	8103000	what if somebody combined House of the
8103000	8105000	Dead and CarnEvil and put, and made
8105000	8107000	them, made it just one game.
8107000	8109000	That would already be House of the
8109000	8111000	Dead. House of the Dead.
8111000	8113000	How so Dark Sakura? Because it's kind
8113000	8115000	of like the shooter and everything.
8115000	8117000	Or maybe I'm picturing in what
8117000	8119000	CD Thunder is describing like an
8119000	8121000	evil carnival maybe. Like a
8121000	8123000	possessed, I guess that is carnival
8123000	8125000	isn't it?
8125000	8127000	Well the thing is
8127000	8129000	I think carnival just needs more zombies.
8129000	8131000	The thing is
8131000	8133000	you go through the House of the Dead
8133000	8135000	and along the way you find this girl
8135000	8137000	and
8137000	8139000	you rescue her and she'd be
8139000	8141000	tag along with you throughout the
8141000	8143000	entire rest
8143000	8145000	of the game and then you think you're done
8145000	8147000	and then one of the evil
8147000	8149000	characters from the CarnEvil
8149000	8151000	game comes out and
8151000	8153000	kidnaps her and then you have to go
8153000	8155000	in there and rescue her.
8155000	8157000	So it'd be one long game instead of just
8157000	8159000	two separate ones. Well you should
8159000	8161000	tweet the idea to Sega because
8161000	8163000	anything is possible through Twitter. That's something we've
8163000	8165000	learned very recently.
8165000	8167000	Alright.
8167000	8169000	Well, CD Thunder buddy I'm gonna let you
8169000	8171000	go so we can get more calls. Do you have any final thoughts?
8173000	8175000	Um
8175000	8177000	Is it, can I plug something?
8177000	8179000	Okay.
8179000	8181000	It's another gaming
8181000	8183000	podcast. It's called 4 Player Podcast.
8183000	8185000	It's really
8185000	8187000	good, not that I'm saying that
8187000	8189000	I'm not saying that this one isn't really good
8189000	8191000	but it's another really good one.
8191000	8193000	No, I'm familiar with
8193000	8195000	that show. It is a fine show
8195000	8197000	and I think some of their folks follow me
8197000	8199000	on Twitter and vice versa so
8199000	8201000	they do a lot with the Justin TV
8201000	8203000	integration which is something
8203000	8205000	we kinda used to do but our radio
8205000	8207000	show is not that exciting to watch
8207000	8209000	so getting a webcam back here hasn't exactly
8209000	8211000	been a high priority for us but they're a little
8211000	8213000	better at integrating all the video, the actual
8213000	8215000	gameplay and all of that so
8215000	8217000	Well if you had a webcam everybody could see
8217000	8219000	Shermie.
8219000	8221000	Maybe we just need a Shermie cam. We'll put
8221000	8223000	a camera under the table and you can see
8223000	8225000	my feet and Shermie. We'll think about that.
8225000	8227000	That's a good suggestion. Alright, later buddy.
8227000	8229000	Bye. Bye.
8229000	8231000	1877 game OLR or a username
8231000	8233000	on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio if you
8233000	8235000	wanna give us a call and
8235000	8237000	I think we're out of tweets.
8237000	8239000	Not a lot of people tweeting us this week.
8239000	8241000	Although I will say this. This actually came in earlier
8241000	8243000	in the week. Zushi13
8243000	8245000	had tweeted us saying, I got to play some bungee
8245000	8247000	ferret toss. It's a really fun game.
8247000	8249000	Oh,
8249000	8251000	13forever tweeted us
8251000	8253000	saying, Sweet! Scribblenuts for iOS
8253000	8255000	Scribblenuts. Scribblenuts
8255000	8257000	for iOS is real and ready
8257000	8259000	for install and tweets us that yeah
8259000	8261000	Scribblenuts came out on the iOS this week. I remember
8261000	8263000	seeing that in the app store. Now my
8263000	8265000	iPhone broke this week.
8265000	8267000	My sleep button no longer works
8267000	8269000	and it's really
8269000	8271000	killed my desire to spend a lot of money
8271000	8273000	on iOS products right now
8273000	8275000	especially when I can't get a new iPhone until January.
8275000	8277000	And I was talking about this a little bit on
8277000	8279000	Bobby's show but
8279000	8281000	you know I'm not exactly in a
8281000	8283000	rush to replace my iPhone. In fact
8283000	8285000	now I'm thinking maybe I want a different phone.
8285000	8287000	But yet I've spent all that money on apps.
8287000	8289000	I don't know what to do.
8289000	8291000	I guess we'll just
8291000	8293000	take another call. Hi you're on Orange Lawns Radio. Who's this?
8293000	8295000	This is Shane. Hey
8295000	8297000	Shane, what's up?
8297000	8299000	Not a whole lot. I just wanted to
8299000	8301000	say the word Skylanders so I could
8301000	8303000	hear the rant that Loki went on earlier
8303000	8305000	than I missed. That's your fault for not being here at
8305000	8307000	6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.
8307000	8309000	I had a work thing
8309000	8311000	I had to go to. It was pizza.
8311000	8313000	Like I was going to pass up pizza.
8315000	8317000	Well, Loki?
8317000	8319000	Heard he made a rant.
8319000	8321000	I'm just saying, you know
8321000	8323000	yeah it's cool that your store sold out
8323000	8325000	of them or whatever.
8325000	8327000	I hope those four copies
8327000	8329000	went pretty fast.
8329000	8331000	I had more than four copies. I had like
8331000	8333000	eight on PS3
8333000	8335000	eight on 360, eight on Wii and four on
8335000	8337000	3DS and then all the little
8337000	8339000	freaking boxes of the single
8339000	8341000	figurines. Do you have games?
8341000	8343000	I mean that eight doesn't sound like a lot.
8343000	8345000	Of course granted you're in Kansas but
8345000	8347000	I'm just saying it's six because they came
8347000	8349000	in case slots of six so
8349000	8351000	that's only one
8351000	8353000	case of each. That's not a lot.
8353000	8355000	I'm curious if there's other games
8355000	8357000	that maybe have the potential to sell eight copies
8357000	8359000	in a day. I mean that doesn't sound like that many.
8359000	8361000	Well across multiple
8361000	8363000	systems on a Sunday release
8363000	8365000	that's not a Nintendo game is
8365000	8367000	pretty significant. I'm optimistic
8367000	8369000	that they're going to fail still.
8369000	8371000	Although I did see a review
8371000	8373000	from some site. It's the
8373000	8375000	only review that they have right now that's like eight
8375000	8377000	out of ten.
8377000	8379000	Like Kotaku for example
8379000	8381000	they're like, I think this concept is pretty awesome.
8381000	8383000	Yeah, you think it's pretty awesome because they sent
8383000	8385000	you five fucking copies of the game and all the
8385000	8387000	toys. Well this looks like fun.
8387000	8389000	The kid in me wants to open
8389000	8391000	this up.
8391000	8393000	Okay, fine, whatever.
8393000	8395000	But reading the feedback from
8395000	8397000	people that are looking at the trailers and stuff
8397000	8399000	they're like, what the fuck happened to Spyro?
8399000	8401000	What have they done to this guy?
8401000	8403000	It's pretty mean now and like the
8403000	8405000	3DS one comes with a black version like
8405000	8407000	an evil Spyro or something.
8407000	8409000	And that was kind of
8409000	8411000	cool looking but he still didn't look like Spyro.
8411000	8413000	Let me kind of
8413000	8415000	turn this on you and ask you about something that we
8415000	8417000	also talked about in the beginning of the show. No, yes.
8417000	8419000	Because last week on the show you were here defending Final Fantasy
8419000	8421000	XIV and saying I should play it again.
8421000	8423000	And I did. And I talked about that
8423000	8425000	at the top of the show. Which you said was pretty
8425000	8427000	negative sounding. Well, it mixed.
8427000	8429000	I would say I gave it a mixed review because there are
8429000	8431000	things I like about it. Like the
8431000	8433000	whole way you can mix and match
8433000	8435000	your talents. And I thought there's so much
8435000	8437000	more to do for a single player now.
8437000	8439000	And I realized that a lot of the crafting
8439000	8441000	jobs are really there for the single player
8441000	8443000	experience. Like you're not exactly going to party up
8443000	8445000	to go do botany together.
8445000	8447000	Like that's really part of the single player game.
8447000	8449000	Ooh, but we should because that would be hilarious.
8449000	8451000	But my
8451000	8453000	real question for you is
8453000	8455000	and then just so you know the bottom line is it's
8455000	8457000	better and it's much better than fucking garbage
8457000	8459000	which is what I called it last time. But
8459000	8461000	I'm not going to pay the monthly fee.
8461000	8463000	And that was the news that came out this week is that
8463000	8465000	now they're charging a monthly fee for Final Fantasy XIV.
8465000	8467000	You didn't know that last week. What's
8467000	8469000	your reaction to all the news about Final Fantasy
8469000	8471000	XIV this week?
8471000	8473000	In regards to the monthly fee
8473000	8475000	I feel like it's way too early
8475000	8477000	and I also feel like that's
8477000	8479000	not what the dev team
8479000	8481000	was going for
8481000	8483000	because recently in a post
8483000	8485000	they said that the game's
8485000	8487000	only like halfway to where they want it to be
8487000	8489000	and they weren't going to start charging a fee till it was
8489000	8491000	100% that way. So clearly that came
8491000	8493000	from the top down.
8493000	8495000	I don't feel like
8495000	8497000	it's really ready for a monthly fee
8497000	8499000	but I will pay it because I am
8499000	8501000	having fun. And
8501000	8503000	in terms of like the other things
8503000	8505000	they announced like completely rebooting the game
8505000	8507000	again, I'm actually kind of
8507000	8509000	excited for that because the one fake little
8509000	8511000	screenshot they made looked really cool
8511000	8513000	and they're adding classes I care about
8513000	8515000	and it's more Final Fantasy now.
8515000	8517000	It sounds like
8517000	8519000	really Final Fantasy XI
8519000	8521000	II with all the changes
8521000	8523000	they're doing. You know I got to admit from that
8523000	8525000	screenshot I don't know why but I was thinking
8525000	8527000	like it looked like Phantasy Star Online
8527000	8529000	with Final Fantasy characters. That would be
8529000	8531000	amazing especially since we
8531000	8533000	probably aren't getting Phantasy Star Online 2.
8533000	8535000	It was one sexy looking screenshot.
8535000	8537000	It is a concept
8537000	8539000	I mean it's not until
8539000	8541000	it's in my hot little hands.
8541000	8543000	And it seems weird to me that they're going to make the graphics
8543000	8545000	look better yet allow the game to run
8545000	8547000	on lower end PCs. It's just about
8547000	8549000	optimization though from what I understand.
8549000	8551000	This game is horribly optimized for
8551000	8553000	anything. Once again though
8553000	8555000	we're talking like a year's time
8555000	8557000	that this thing is going to be
8557000	8559000	fully rebooted. I mean
8559000	8561000	I just can only imagine
8561000	8563000	the games are going to look still even
8563000	8565000	better than they are now.
8565000	8567000	To me it's almost
8567000	8569000	like the
8569000	8571000	Wii U I guess. You know how they're kind of late
8571000	8573000	to the game with everything and it's like
8573000	8575000	oh look we're pushing these HD graphics
8575000	8577000	that everyone else has been putting out for like
8577000	8579000	years now.
8579000	8581000	It kind of seems like to me.
8581000	8583000	But it still looks sexy.
8583000	8585000	Will it be good enough for me to play?
8585000	8587000	Well it does have the uniqueness of being a Japanese MMO
8587000	8589000	that's pretty big here in the states.
8589000	8591000	You know at least Final Fantasy 11 is.
8591000	8593000	You know and there's not a lot of
8593000	8595000	Asian in general no matter what
8595000	8597000	country MMOs that do
8597000	8599000	very well here. Most of the MMOs that are doing
8599000	8601000	well here are developed by
8601000	8603000	studios that are here. Like WoW
8603000	8605000	of course is the big one developed by Blizzard.
8605000	8607000	So you know I don't know.
8607000	8609000	I guess
8609000	8611000	that was really all I wanted to ask you was about
8611000	8613000	Final Fantasy 14 and where you're at with that.
8613000	8615000	So are you going to be paying for WoW and Final Fantasy
8615000	8617000	14 or are you saying you're like
8617000	8619000	into 14 so much you might cancel WoW?
8619000	8621000	Yeah I might.
8621000	8623000	It depends on what Blizzcon says this week.
8623000	8625000	And
8625000	8627000	how fun 4.3 is.
8627000	8629000	Also when it comes out
8629000	8631000	because who knows how long that is. But I'm just sick of
8631000	8633000	you know grinding rep in
8633000	8635000	Firelands and
8635000	8637000	jumping. So Final Fantasy
8637000	8639000	14 is something pretty and distracting right now right?
8639000	8641000	Yes. And it's still free
8641000	8643000	because they said they'll give us ample
8643000	8645000	notice of when it actually goes to pay.
8645000	8647000	And I'm guessing it's more
8647000	8649000	like early December instead of
8649000	8651000	late November. So I still have like
8651000	8653000	two months. I'm wondering
8653000	8655000	how my 30 day trial is going to play into it.
8655000	8657000	I totally am going to get screwed with that.
8657000	8659000	Like my 30 day trial will be up and then the
8659000	8661000	fee kicks in. It's like I didn't get
8661000	8663000	shit. I didn't get shit
8663000	8665000	like everybody else got. Oh well.
8665000	8667000	Oh well I'm part of that too. I mean I've only been
8667000	8669000	playing for what a week longer than you? You didn't
8669000	8671000	even buy the damn game. It was conked to you.
8671000	8673000	That's true. So shut up.
8673000	8675000	I didn't get it for free.
8675000	8677000	I paid 25 bucks for it.
8677000	8679000	I paid half what most people
8679000	8681000	paid for it new but I still paid 25 bucks
8681000	8683000	for it. And then my DVD
8683000	8685000	was damaged. And screw that.
8685000	8687000	Square needs to learn
8687000	8689000	how to make a PC game for fuck's sake.
8689000	8691000	Alright. I do think the game
8691000	8693000	is going to be pretty neat on Playstation 3.
8693000	8695000	Yeah. I think I might
8695000	8697000	jump to that when it comes out.
8697000	8699000	Do you think the game can save itself?
8699000	8701000	Like do you think a game can actually
8701000	8703000	relaunch and
8703000	8705000	be credible? I think
8705000	8707000	I think it can.
8707000	8709000	But probably not to the extent
8709000	8711000	that they're hoping for.
8711000	8713000	Like I think it'll bring in a few more
8713000	8715000	people. It'll probably keep
8715000	8717000	the current players. But it's not
8717000	8719000	going to be a huge
8719000	8721000	relaunch. Despite what they
8721000	8723000	want. You're not going to get thousands
8723000	8725000	and thousands of more people playing.
8725000	8727000	I think honestly the smart thing for them to do is
8727000	8729000	to go to the Guild Wars model where you're not totally
8729000	8731000	free to play. But once you buy the game
8731000	8733000	you get to play online for free. And they
8733000	8735000	should look at doing expansions for money.
8735000	8737000	Or just you know more regular content
8737000	8739000	updates like what they're doing with Final Fantasy 11
8739000	8741000	that cost money. And that
8741000	8743000	that's how they should do it. They did that. I'd buy it.
8743000	8745000	For sure. The monthly fee is not
8745000	8747000	going to work for this game anymore. Except for Final Fantasy 11
8747000	8749000	does those little
8749000	8751000	baby expansions and still charges you
8751000	8753000	a monthly fee. But Final Fantasy 11 is also
8753000	8755000	a better game. Ooh
8755000	8757000	that's true.
8757000	8759000	It's not as pretty.
8759000	8761000	Alright on that note I'm going to let you go alright?
8761000	8763000	Alright. Alright take care. Bye.
8763000	8765000	Alright I guess that's
8765000	8767000	all I'm going to do over the Skype line tonight.
8767000	8769000	Sorry to those of you that didn't get through.
8769000	8771000	But why don't you think about writing us an email.
8771000	8773000	Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com
8773000	8775000	is the place to send us an email if you'd like.
8775000	8777000	Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com or of course
8777000	8779000	Twitter. We had a very empty Twitter tonight. I'm very
8779000	8781000	sad. Twitter.com slash
8781000	8783000	O-L-R. Alright.
8783000	8785000	Well that's going to wrap up another show. I've got to
8785000	8787000	ask though Dark Soccer and Loki if they have any last minute
8787000	8789000	stories they want to throw out here. I've
8789000	8791000	started a political social blog.
8791000	8793000	Oh dear.
8793000	8795000	Wait a minute. Women think independently now?
8795000	8797000	I'm teasing.
8799000	8801000	Girl.
8801000	8803000	She's trying very hard not
8803000	8805000	to laugh. Like she wants to give me that stern
8805000	8807000	I hate you look but she can't do it. Rob's going to take
8807000	8809000	me to Pinkberry to appease me.
8809000	8811000	Whatever. Alright.
8811000	8813000	Vote no on that.
8813000	8815000	That's my political blog.
8815000	8817000	Alright. You know I'm just giving you a hard
8817000	8819000	time. Yeah I know. Good luck with that. That's what
8819000	8821000	you're. I was going to
8821000	8823000	do another joke but I can't.
8823000	8825000	No it's my second blog. Alright.
8825000	8827000	Cause my other blog's like about
8827000	8829000	girly shit. Okay. Alright.
8829000	8831000	Alright. Loki
8831000	8833000	any last minute news you want to get into?
8833000	8835000	They're supposed to be doing a
8835000	8837000	Layton Brothers game for iPhone
8837000	8839000	sometime soon. I'm assuming this is
8839000	8841000	only going to be on the Japanese IS so.
8841000	8843000	It's neat though if you
8843000	8845000	want to play you know Layton.
8845000	8847000	Yeah Layton's a good series. It'll be fun on the iPhone.
8847000	8849000	Let me go to the chat room cause we
8849000	8851000	haven't read enough of chat tonight and I apologize.
8851000	8853000	I'm watching you guys but we just haven't had a whole lot
8853000	8855000	of stuff I've been able to work into the show.
8855000	8857000	Plus live listeners are really behind tonight.
8857000	8859000	Not of any fault of your guyses. Like I just
8859000	8861000	noticed the delay is like several minutes tonight
8861000	8863000	so I don't know what's up. But anyway.
8863000	8865000	I want to read this cause this guy said
8865000	8867000	after five years listening he's finally listening to
8867000	8869000	a live show. It's Swongtong
8869000	8871000	his name in chat and Swongtong asks
8871000	8873000	how come MMOs on Playstation
8873000	8875000	3 don't use the mouse and keyboard?
8875000	8877000	Actually some
8877000	8879000	do and I believe Final Fantasy 14
8879000	8881000	is still they're going to plan on using a keyboard
8881000	8883000	even when it rolls out to the Playstation 3.
8883000	8885000	And everything on
8885000	8887000	Playstation 3 is all Bluetooth
8887000	8889000	and USB anyway right? Like I know
8889000	8891000	on Xbox 360 you can hook in a keyboard
8891000	8893000	you can play Final Fantasy 11 on 360
8893000	8895000	with a keyboard. I used to do that
8895000	8897000	when it first came out. So
8897000	8899000	as far as Playstation 3 goes you can
8899000	8901000	put in a keyboard. You can
8901000	8903000	type messages and so forth.
8903000	8905000	As far as MMOs embracing it
8905000	8907000	well maybe the keyboard adoption policy isn't
8907000	8909000	maybe high enough to do that but I think for a game like
8909000	8911000	Final Fantasy 14 like if I were to play that on
8911000	8913000	the Playstation 3 I definitely would have to have
8913000	8915000	a keyboard. Luckily I already
8915000	8917000	have one that's specifically for
8917000	8919000	the gaming consoles. It lights up blue it's really
8919000	8921000	pretty. Alright.
8921000	8923000	Loki any other stories for
8923000	8925000	us tonight?
8925000	8927000	No
8927000	8929000	the only other story I have is not really gaming
8929000	8931000	related but my wife is trying to
8931000	8933000	download the version
8933000	8935000	of Firefox that is British
8935000	8937000	English so that all of her
8937000	8939000	stuff will be spell checked into
8939000	8941000	the Queen's English because she's
8941000	8943000	obsessed with Game
8943000	8945000	of Thrones and I don't know why.
8945000	8947000	Tell her
8947000	8949000	she better start learning to use more vowels.
8949000	8951000	I would have put that on Dark Soccer to do
8951000	8953000	something like that before Nelly.
8953000	8955000	I've done it before. Okay
8955000	8957000	never mind I stand clear. Well no I've actually
8957000	8959000	got a British
8959000	8961000	grammar checker. Okay.
8961000	8963000	Because well every so
8963000	8965000	okay here's a true story. Use less z's
8965000	8967000	and more u's there you go.
8967000	8969000	In college I actually had this whole thing
8969000	8971000	where I was doing nothing but writing everything in British English
8971000	8973000	and my teacher let me do it he just said pick one
8973000	8975000	and write in it.
8975000	8977000	So every so often
8977000	8979000	less z's. Excuse me.
8979000	8981000	Fewer z's.
8981000	8983000	Alright.
8983000	8985000	Don't use that.
8985000	8987000	What? The z word.
8987000	8989000	I guess that's it.
8989000	8991000	So we're going around and getting everybody's final thought
8991000	8993000	and wrapping up another week here at Orange Laundry.
8993000	8995000	Before we do that I really want to thank you guys again
8995000	8997000	for tuning in and spending another week with us.
8997000	8999000	Thank you so much. You know all we ask we do this
8999000	9001000	for free. You'll notice there's no advertising or
9001000	9003000	anything like that except for our own other side
9003000	9005000	projects. Which by the way include
9005000	9007000	the best little Horde house in Azeroth at Hordehouse.com
9007000	9009000	if you like your Warcraft. We had a fun show
9009000	9011000	tonight. In fact we taped earlier today. This is my second
9011000	9013000	podcast of the day. But other than
9013000	9015000	ads for our own side projects. And you know
9015000	9017000	someone has not been putting album art
9017000	9019000	on Facebook. Because I like to see
9019000	9021000	which ones get put up. Because they're
9021000	9023000	funny. I've been putting them on Facebook.
9023000	9025000	Oh I haven't upgraded the gallery. You're right.
9025000	9027000	But if you go in and look at the posts they're there.
9027000	9029000	But they're teeny.
9029000	9031000	Then go to Hordehouse.com. Alright.
9031000	9033000	Because they're teeny. Alright I'll get the big ones
9033000	9035000	on Facebook. But anyway.
9035000	9037000	What I really want to say is thank you guys very
9037000	9039000	much for tuning in. Thank you for supporting our show.
9039000	9041000	The OL Army which is what we call
9041000	9043000	our fans make this all worth it. And
9043000	9045000	keep us motivated to do this for years and years.
9045000	9047000	If you like the show all
9047000	9049000	we ask. Tell a friend. Tell
9049000	9051000	somebody about the show. Word of mouth is all we
9051000	9053000	got. We're not funded by a million dollar magazine.
9053000	9055000	So please. Please help us spread the
9055000	9057000	word. And again I'll just say the podcast
9057000	9059000	awards. Great way to help spread the word. So
9059000	9061000	please consider throwing us your vote over
9061000	9063000	in that contest at podcastawards.com.
9063000	9065000	And one more
9065000	9067000	shout out to our buddies at The Geek Spin who are
9067000	9069000	also nominated. And we hope that even
9069000	9071000	if we can't win we hope they do.
9071000	9073000	They're in best pod safe music.
9073000	9075000	In a perfect world we both win. But you know
9075000	9077000	we don't always get what we want.
9077000	9079000	We don't always get what we want. Alright.
9079000	9081000	Anyhow. Let's go
9081000	9083000	around and get everybody's final thought.
9083000	9085000	Loki. What's your final thought tonight?
9085000	9087000	I am
9087000	9089000	now telling my wife how to
9089000	9091000	add a British
9091000	9093000	English spell check
9093000	9095000	to it. And I unfortunately had to add it
9095000	9097000	to mine in order to figure out how to do it. So now I
9097000	9099000	can talk in the Queen's English if I really wanted
9099000	9101000	to. But
9101000	9103000	I don't want to.
9103000	9105000	Congratulations. You'll have to start
9105000	9107000	tweeting in the Queen's English.
9107000	9109000	Speaking of the Queen. Dark Soccer. Your final thought
9109000	9111000	tonight.
9111000	9113000	I am disillusioned with this country.
9113000	9115000	My final
9115000	9117000	thought tonight is Pretty Rainbow.
9117000	9119000	Pretty Rainbow.
9119000	9121000	Where? Your dresser's
9121000	9123000	little drawers there. Oh yeah.
9123000	9125000	Actually that is why I bought it. Alright.
9125000	9127000	That's it. Thank you guys for tuning
9127000	9129000	in and listening to us. We'll do it again
9129000	9131000	next week. Dark Soccer is next week your week
9131000	9133000	off or is that two weeks? No it's not the week after.
9133000	9135000	Alright so we'll all be back here then
9135000	9137000	next week. So until then
9137000	9139000	have a wonderful night. Be safe.
9139000	9141000	And please when you're gaming online
9141000	9163000	don't be a dick. Good night.
9171000	9173000	See you next week.
