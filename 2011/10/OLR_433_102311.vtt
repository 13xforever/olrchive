[SPEAKER_08]: She is en route to Anaheim right now.

01:09.429 --> 01:11.350
[SPEAKER_08]: She's going to BlizzCon a little too late.

01:11.932 --> 01:14.773
[SPEAKER_08]: No, obviously, what's next door to BlizzCon?

01:14.833 --> 01:15.353
[SPEAKER_08]: Disneyland.

01:15.393 --> 01:17.954

[SPEAKER_08]: They always want to know, what was dinner tonight?

01:31.138 --> 01:34.399
[SPEAKER_06]: Double Western Bacon Cheeseburger from Carl's Jr.

01:34.639 --> 01:34.959
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

01:35.019 --> 01:40.700
[SPEAKER_08]: Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to join us live in our chat room.

01:41.580 --> 01:47.621
[SPEAKER_08]: Joining us tonight, since DarkSakura is not here, we do have another panelist here tonight.

01:47.962 --> 01:52.782
[SPEAKER_08]: So kind to always fill in on all the OLR Network shows when there's an opening.

01:53.063 --> 01:55.043
[SPEAKER_08]: Say hello to the one and only Salacious Pop.

01:55.803 --> 01:56.163
[SPEAKER_08]: What up?

01:57.263 --> 01:58.364
[SPEAKER_08]: How you doing, Salacious Pop?

01:58.444 --> 01:59.004
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm doing all right.

01:59.024 --> 01:59.384
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you?

01:59.604 --> 01:59.944
[SPEAKER_08]: Sup?

02:02.483 --> 02:03.163
[SPEAKER_08]: I am good.

02:03.223 --> 02:04.084
[SPEAKER_08]: What's new with you?

02:04.224 --> 02:05.864
[SPEAKER_08]: How's life been treating you?

02:06.845 --> 02:07.445
[SPEAKER_05]: Fairly boring.

02:08.145 --> 02:08.645
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm around.

02:09.306 --> 02:09.806
[SPEAKER_05]: I live with you.

02:09.846 --> 02:10.386
[SPEAKER_05]: You should know.

02:10.446 --> 02:11.286
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't have to ask me that.

02:12.087 --> 02:15.468
[SPEAKER_08]: This is what we call radio banter, where you entertain the listeners.

02:15.868 --> 02:17.349
[SPEAKER_08]: You still have a lot to learn, young one.

02:19.071 --> 02:25.093
[SPEAKER_08]: Join our chatroom, chat.orangeloungeradio.com DDR Dollar Bill is in our chatroom tonight saying it's an all-male review.

02:25.573 --> 02:27.934
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, tonight is an all-male review.

02:29.014 --> 02:30.454
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe we'll have some female callers.

02:30.514 --> 02:30.794
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see.

02:30.834 --> 02:40.457
[SPEAKER_08]: We will take your live calls later on in the show in Part B. Getting right into the video game chat tonight, Derek H throws down the gauntlet, so to speak, in our chatroom.

02:40.797 --> 02:46.839
[SPEAKER_08]: OLR, I would like to invite you and your listeners to participate in the big battle racing series on Forza 4.

02:47.739 --> 02:47.900
[SPEAKER_08]: Pimbal

02:56.621 --> 02:57.362
[SPEAKER_08]: Forza 4, Gran Turismo

03:19.136 --> 03:36.990
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't even have Forza I need someone to step up in our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com to participate on behalf of OLR We need somebody to do it Somebody needs to show that we are not all weak when it comes to racing games But of course, when Mario Kart 7 comes out, it's on You'd play it if it was Initial D, right?

03:37.170 --> 03:47.678
[SPEAKER_08]: You love that game Yeah, as long as it had Eurobeat in the background That would be awesome But see, Initial D, again, is an arcade racer And I love Midnight Maximum Tune in the arcades I'd be down with Ridge Racer

03:48.919 --> 04:04.957
[SPEAKER_08]: Ridge Racer Anyway, if you want more information on that you want to sign up on behalf of Orange Lounge Radio TheBigBattle.net So check that out and yeah, we need some helps representing Forza 4 because Lord knows I can't

04:06.679 --> 04:10.941
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, before we get into our gaming week, so I wanted to talk about this a little bit.

04:11.641 --> 04:13.042
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, first, I gotta throw this out there.

04:13.082 --> 04:14.903
[SPEAKER_08]: We've been mentioning this the past couple weeks on the show.

04:15.283 --> 04:16.244
[SPEAKER_08]: I gotta reiterate this.

04:16.824 --> 04:22.727
[SPEAKER_08]: We are nominated in the 2011 Podcast Awards, www.podcastawards.com.

04:23.867 --> 04:24.568
[SPEAKER_08]: We need your votes.

04:25.288 --> 04:27.609
[SPEAKER_08]: You can vote every day between now and the 27th.

04:27.689 --> 04:28.990
[SPEAKER_08]: We mentioned this last week on the show.

04:29.570 --> 04:31.051
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't ask a lot here at Orange Launch Radio.

04:31.091 --> 04:32.792
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't play advertising on the show.

04:33.132 --> 04:37.194
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't ask for your money or premium subscriptions or sell any apps or anything like that.

04:37.595 --> 04:40.596
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you like what you hear, all we ask is that you spread the word.

04:40.636 --> 04:41.697
[SPEAKER_08]: We say that at the end of every show.

04:42.277 --> 05:09.800
[SPEAKER_08]: and winning the award would be great for promotion and not just us but the network we're on it would be terrific we won the award back in 2005 when podcasting was like first first out there and it was great promotion then but since then a lot of corporate cast have come in and really just dominated because you know they can put ads in their magazines and they get millions of visitors on their sites so us lowly independents you know have a struggle a lot to promote amongst that

05:10.060 --> 05:15.102
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, there's a lot of great independent shows nominated, so I'm feeling pretty good that at least some deserving independent will win.

05:15.642 --> 05:17.883
[SPEAKER_08]: But, of course, we'd like it to be us.

05:17.923 --> 05:18.944
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not gonna lie.

05:19.824 --> 05:24.626
[SPEAKER_08]: So, please, if you enjoy Orange Lounge Radio, consider voting for us in the podcast awards.

05:26.547 --> 05:28.369
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura will be back next week too.

05:28.409 --> 05:31.692
[SPEAKER_08]: I had a little note to mention that for those that are DarkSakura fans.

05:32.012 --> 05:34.794
[SPEAKER_08]: We will still have a classic game of the week and all that fun stuff tonight, so stay tuned.

05:35.535 --> 05:40.139
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to talk about this story too before we get into the gaming weeks and the news and all that.

05:40.499 --> 05:43.641
[SPEAKER_08]: And that is this interesting way that gaming maybe is changing.

05:44.222 --> 05:48.365
[SPEAKER_08]: This little kind of like blink and you miss it story came up this week and it was about FIFA 12.

05:49.306 --> 05:57.908
[SPEAKER_08]: And especially for a lot of the people in our audience, I know we don't have as many sports games fans, you know, because I know a lot of you guys, we started with music games, a lot of you into role-playing games, some of that too.

05:58.369 --> 06:01.509
[SPEAKER_08]: But certainly there's the occasional sports game that we all enjoy.

06:02.490 --> 06:07.531
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, for me, the old NBA Jam, Blades of Steel, a lot of the old school stuff.

06:08.631 --> 06:17.214
[SPEAKER_08]: But what I think is interesting about this whole FIFA 12 thing is that you can play FIFA 12, at least a demo of it, right, via YouTube.

06:18.274 --> 06:28.921
[SPEAKER_08]: and I guess it's like a partnership that this company Gaikai is doing with YouTube where you go on and you can go to this page to visit information about FIFA 12 and you can actually stream this demo.

06:29.421 --> 06:32.163
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't download anything to your computer or what have you.

06:32.243 --> 06:33.024
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like OnLive.

06:33.184 --> 06:37.306
[SPEAKER_08]: This is basically an OnLive competitor but no standalone client.

06:37.326 --> 06:39.048
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess it's all run through Java or what have you.

06:39.528 --> 06:40.308
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can go on

06:41.289 --> 06:49.336
[SPEAKER_08]: Check out this game and stream it and all the graphics and everything through the magic of the cloud gaming and all that stuff.

06:49.356 --> 06:51.437
[SPEAKER_08]: So you're not really downloading a whole lot to your computer.

06:51.998 --> 06:57.763
[SPEAKER_08]: And while this might not seem like such a big deal at first, I kind of go like, okay, well, hold on a minute.

06:59.324 --> 07:01.065
[SPEAKER_08]: If this is...

07:02.046 --> 07:06.712
[SPEAKER_08]: Going on YouTube, which is how we watch a lot of movies and music videos now.

07:06.773 --> 07:09.056
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, does MTV play music videos anymore?

07:09.616 --> 07:09.817
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

07:10.197 --> 07:10.938
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes.

07:11.399 --> 07:12.660
[SPEAKER_08]: Where do we get our music videos?

07:12.700 --> 07:13.982
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they have a show that does that.

07:14.022 --> 07:15.604
[SPEAKER_08]: Like one show that comes on at midnight?

07:16.526 --> 07:16.786
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

07:17.134 --> 07:18.675
[SPEAKER_06]: Beavis and Butthead is coming back this week.

07:19.215 --> 07:20.556
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's old school.

07:20.616 --> 07:21.937
[SPEAKER_08]: That is awesome.

07:23.558 --> 07:24.218
[SPEAKER_08]: But what does this mean?

07:24.498 --> 07:26.539
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you think this could mean anything for the future of gaming?

07:26.559 --> 07:29.541
[SPEAKER_08]: Because now we've got two companies that are going into cloud gaming.

07:30.241 --> 07:34.624
[SPEAKER_08]: And later on tonight we're going to get into rumors about the Xbox and whatever next is for them.

07:34.644 --> 07:35.905
[SPEAKER_08]: And then PlayStation 4.

07:37.866 --> 07:40.447
[SPEAKER_08]: Could this be technology that we see built into consoles?

07:40.507 --> 07:42.288
[SPEAKER_08]: Is this something that's going to go wider?

07:43.089 --> 07:43.449
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you think?

07:44.150 --> 07:52.536
[SPEAKER_05]: This kind of reminds me of that Vaporware console that was announced around the time the 360 and the PS3 were, which was, I believe, the Phantom.

07:52.916 --> 07:58.720
[SPEAKER_05]: If you remember that, where you could sign up to sign up to get the preliminary launch announcement.

07:58.801 --> 08:03.084
[SPEAKER_08]: I do remember that, and I think that's why a lot of people kind of laughed at OnLive when it first came out.

08:03.424 --> 08:04.985
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I remember going to that E3.

08:05.245 --> 08:07.207
[SPEAKER_08]: Were you at that E3, Loki, or was that the year after you went?

08:07.467 --> 08:10.049
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, remember when OnLive was there on the floor, and it was like...

08:10.689 --> 08:12.030
[SPEAKER_08]: Holy shit, it works!

08:12.450 --> 08:15.273
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, a lot of people were like, okay, wait, where's the box?

08:15.433 --> 08:16.193
[SPEAKER_08]: What's the trick?

08:16.534 --> 08:19.436
[SPEAKER_08]: And like, that was really people's reaction to OnLive is, holy shit, it works.

08:19.776 --> 08:24.940
[SPEAKER_08]: Now OnLive's biggest challenge is getting the games on the service, you know, they don't really have a lot, unfortunately.

08:25.561 --> 08:26.381
[SPEAKER_08]: But it works.

08:26.602 --> 08:29.764
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, the Phantom and all that kind of made people skeptical.

08:29.964 --> 08:32.887
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't so much a gaming console as it was a gaming appliance.

08:33.607 --> 08:48.515
[SPEAKER_05]: but that didn't really seem like you know there was no way to actually load media onto it it was all kind of DLC or all streaming and that seems like well why can't you just do that on a computer once they can figure out the parity between the bandwidth and the response time and it sounds like it's here so

08:49.315 --> 08:51.977
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but do you think this is something that we could see?

08:52.017 --> 08:57.782
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, you know, right now we have Xbox Live Arcade where you download these little games to the console, you know, PlayStation Network.

08:58.042 --> 09:02.065
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you think there's going to come a time where we stream games through these services?

09:02.565 --> 09:07.609
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely, because, I mean, as bandwidth gets better, it's going to get even easier to stream something like that.

09:08.410 --> 09:11.953
[SPEAKER_06]: And, I mean, they're only a couple hundred meg at most.

09:12.033 --> 09:14.595
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, well, some are like a couple gig, but...

09:15.295 --> 09:20.218
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, they have limits in size and stuff to what they can put on Xbox Live Arcade.

09:20.798 --> 09:36.686
[SPEAKER_06]: So, it would be possible to stream something like that, or if they have a way to where they can split the game up, you know, by level or whatever, so that you start streaming the beginning, and as you progress through the game, you know, the rest of the levels are streaming in, then, yeah, definitely, it's something they could do.

09:36.726 --> 09:39.908
[SPEAKER_06]: Plus, you know, with all the announcements, like, a couple weeks ago, where...

09:40.989 --> 09:54.640
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, both Unreal's now being supported in web browsers and, you know, also Crytek is looking at getting the CryEngine in, you know, to Flash as well.

09:54.760 --> 09:56.902
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, with that stuff coming about.

09:58.024 --> 10:02.767
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I can definitely see them doing a lot more gaming on demand type stuff through web browsers.

10:02.907 --> 10:05.869
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, I mean, that way you don't even have to sell a console.

10:06.069 --> 10:08.910
[SPEAKER_06]: So that could be kind of bad news for consoles, actually, if you think about it.

10:09.511 --> 10:14.734
[SPEAKER_08]: Could you imagine in the future, I mean, this might be actually a horrible thing, or maybe we're already there, I don't know.

10:15.114 --> 10:17.335
[SPEAKER_08]: But remember how we would go to arcades?

10:18.596 --> 10:21.138
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember the arcade when they weren't full of ticket machines?

10:21.198 --> 10:23.239
[SPEAKER_08]: We would go there to, like, play against people and stuff?

10:23.599 --> 10:35.867
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, what about a system where you deposit a virtual quarter or a token and play a game streaming against, you know, play around a Soul Calibur 2, or I guess now it would be 5, against somebody long distance?

10:35.967 --> 10:38.389
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I think we're kind of already there.

10:38.789 --> 10:40.050
[SPEAKER_06]: That won't work, and here's why.

10:40.070 --> 10:42.972
[SPEAKER_06]: It's because they've tried that already with, like, the iOS stuff.

10:42.992 --> 10:45.113
[SPEAKER_06]: You have, you know, the Capcom games where you can...

10:45.733 --> 10:50.516
[SPEAKER_06]: Pay a quarter to play an arcade game on a handheld system or something like that.

10:50.556 --> 10:52.698
[SPEAKER_06]: And people are like, no, I'm not going to do that.

10:52.718 --> 10:57.501
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and iOS also sucks for gaming unless the game is built around the touchscreen.

10:57.741 --> 11:04.226
[SPEAKER_06]: Even if it was on my computer and I had a controller and stuff like that, I would not pay per game.

11:04.766 --> 11:05.566
[SPEAKER_06]: No, screw that.

11:06.167 --> 11:06.827
[SPEAKER_06]: I bought the game.

11:07.468 --> 11:08.709
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to play the game like that.

11:08.729 --> 11:10.890
[SPEAKER_08]: But you used to play 50 cents per round of DDR, right?

11:11.755 --> 11:13.216
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and that's a little bit different.

11:13.256 --> 11:17.077
[SPEAKER_06]: Are they going to ship me some pads and ship me a nice arcade system?

11:17.117 --> 11:22.019
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, well, I'll consider it then, but it's not like that.

11:22.199 --> 11:26.781
[SPEAKER_06]: You're using all my hardware, and all you're doing is sending me the code for your game.

11:28.762 --> 11:30.362
[SPEAKER_05]: It's being rendered off-site, though, right?

11:30.402 --> 11:31.483
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just being streamed to you.

11:33.444 --> 11:35.525
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you don't need the graphics card or anything, right?

11:35.645 --> 11:36.485
[SPEAKER_08]: It's in the cloud.

11:36.765 --> 11:37.825
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all in the cloud.

11:37.885 --> 11:39.046
[SPEAKER_08]: Through the magic of the cloud.

11:40.487 --> 11:41.388
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't like the cloud.

11:42.489 --> 11:43.790
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck the cloud, is that what you're saying?

11:44.050 --> 11:44.851
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck the cloud, yeah.

11:45.351 --> 11:52.537
[SPEAKER_05]: He was Final Fantasy's best antagonist, and I don't know why.

11:52.577 --> 11:53.218
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm kidding.

11:53.238 --> 12:01.004
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what also this whole discussion about arcades and things makes me think, and it makes me kind of sad, is that are we ever going to have anything like DDR ever again?

12:01.104 --> 12:06.008
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't mean like the game itself, but I mean kind of like the community that that built, which includes this show.

12:06.969 --> 12:11.092
[SPEAKER_05]: Guitar Hero and Rock Band, right?

12:11.112 --> 12:12.672
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not what I mean, though.

12:12.713 --> 12:20.437
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm talking about, we used to go to the arcade to celebrate people's birthdays and sit around the fourth mix machine and watch people fuck off.

12:20.797 --> 12:26.280
[SPEAKER_06]: The problem is, it's not profitable as much for arcades anymore to have that kind of stuff in their arcades.

12:26.741 --> 12:33.585
[SPEAKER_06]: So what you need to do is you need to have arcades that really just want that there and find a way to become profitable as well.

12:34.181 --> 12:38.424
[SPEAKER_08]: How do you get people to leave the couch when it's so easy now to click button play game?

12:38.685 --> 12:43.028
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I think it's... I mean, you still can't emulate everything that you can do in the arcade.

12:43.068 --> 12:49.994
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the experiences in the arcade are still going to be vastly superior as far as controls go.

12:50.014 --> 12:52.876
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, arcade sticks and stuff like that, yeah, definitely supplement that.

12:53.217 --> 12:54.478
[SPEAKER_06]: But not everyone's buying that.

12:54.618 --> 12:56.579
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's still fun to play in the arcade.

12:56.599 --> 12:57.160
[SPEAKER_06]: But the problem is...

12:57.640 --> 13:04.184
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, a lot of people are playing stuff that they could play in the arcade at home, like fighting games and racing games and stuff like that.

13:04.685 --> 13:11.289
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, dancing games and stuff, I don't think that's really something you can emulate at home.

13:11.329 --> 13:14.030
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not even necessarily talking about a dancing game or a music game.

13:14.050 --> 13:16.512
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just talking about a game that establishes such a sense of community.

13:16.792 --> 13:20.254
[SPEAKER_08]: The closest thing I can think of that I see now is maybe some of the racing games.

13:20.434 --> 13:24.397
[SPEAKER_08]: I do still see Initial D has a pretty big contingent in the racing games in the arcade.

13:24.537 --> 13:29.362
[SPEAKER_08]: There's fighting, of course fighting games, but it's not as big as it used to be.

13:29.623 --> 13:34.948
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there's still communities out there, but they're spread out or they're on Facebook or something like that.

13:34.968 --> 13:42.857
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, go to any gaming Facebook page and there's tons of people that are fans of that game on there talking about stuff.

13:43.738 --> 13:48.462
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to get people excited about something at the arcade, you make it arcade only.

13:48.522 --> 13:51.885
[SPEAKER_06]: You make a reason for people to go there constantly.

13:53.066 --> 13:59.972
[SPEAKER_06]: Whether it be unlocking stuff on the machine or just some unique style of gameplay.

14:01.534 --> 14:02.255
[SPEAKER_06]: People will go there.

14:02.275 --> 14:05.818
[SPEAKER_06]: People will have fun and create communities around it.

14:06.398 --> 14:33.889
[SPEAKER_06]: it's just unfortunately you know like Dance Dance Revolution started really much as an arcade game and yeah there were some of the Japanese versions but for a long time that's all there was was the arcade and that's why people would go there and then they formed a community around it but then once they started coming out with a lot more home versions yeah you don't really necessarily need to go to the arcade anymore yeah but the home versions had crap songs for the longest time yes that's true but then also a lot of the people grew up and they just decided we all turned 30

14:34.429 --> 14:35.851
[SPEAKER_06]: Shit, Native Society, no.

14:37.032 --> 14:38.473
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got a lot more things going on.

14:38.573 --> 14:42.257
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't really make it out to the arcade to go play games.

14:42.317 --> 14:46.041
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's just, you know, time.

14:46.061 --> 14:54.370
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, do I go drive, you know, 10 minutes, 15 minutes or whatever to my arcade to go hang out by myself, you know, or...

14:55.089 --> 15:03.111
[SPEAKER_08]: I think my mind was kind of going in this direction because I'd heard something... Well, DDR Freak officially closed this week.

15:03.171 --> 15:10.914
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I know we had the talk a couple weeks ago about how DDR Freak was closing and the server was offline, but the server came back up for JDog to post a message that said, it's over.

15:11.194 --> 15:14.835
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, the whole epilogue and the forums are locked down because of spam and everything.

15:15.135 --> 15:16.255
[SPEAKER_08]: It is officially done.

15:16.295 --> 15:16.755
[SPEAKER_08]: Game over.

15:16.815 --> 15:17.095
[SPEAKER_08]: Failed.

15:17.716 --> 15:19.016
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, that whole thing.

15:19.056 --> 15:19.496
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I don't know.

15:19.516 --> 15:22.317
[SPEAKER_08]: It kind of had me thinking about the whole DDR and the community and all that because, you know, it was...

15:22.677 --> 15:22.737
[SPEAKER_08]: D.D.R.

15:22.777 --> 15:23.017
[SPEAKER_08]: Freak

15:50.900 --> 15:59.707
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd heard rumors about, speaking of arcades and communities and all that, the rumors about a DDR get-together for the 20th of November, which I think is supposed to be a Sunday.

16:00.047 --> 16:02.429
[SPEAKER_08]: But I haven't heard anything about if that's actually happening or not.

16:02.689 --> 16:03.429
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think it should.

16:04.050 --> 16:06.111
[SPEAKER_08]: If they're not going to organize something, I think we should.

16:07.812 --> 16:08.233
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

16:08.733 --> 16:11.575
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll just have to find out and find out fast.

16:11.595 --> 16:13.036
[SPEAKER_08]: That's only, what, like four weeks away?

16:13.056 --> 16:13.557
[SPEAKER_08]: Something like that?

16:14.257 --> 16:15.418
[SPEAKER_08]: So, don't have a lot of time.

16:16.155 --> 16:16.875
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no time!

16:17.756 --> 16:19.577
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, let's move on.

16:20.317 --> 16:28.981
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me get a couple more comments from our chatroom at chat.orange.radio.com Derek H. I think is trying to play this FIFA demo online and brings up an interesting point about just how easy this all is.

16:29.041 --> 16:32.282
[SPEAKER_08]: Derek H. says, This FIFA thing is stalled at starting game.

16:32.342 --> 16:33.343
[SPEAKER_08]: Please wait a moment.

16:33.683 --> 16:35.944
[SPEAKER_08]: Now I gotta upgrade Java and the download failed.

16:36.224 --> 16:38.945
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it would have been faster if they just let me download the demo.

16:39.145 --> 16:40.166
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't like Gaikai.

16:42.268 --> 17:11.464
[SPEAKER_06]: and um it's a pretty good point you know as simple as this all might be push button play game doesn't always work it's not always that easy and really I mean yeah the technology is cool and it might be fun to check it out because of the technology but I don't give a crap about FIFA I just don't and I figure you know if I'm gonna play a FIFA demo I have a 360 I can download the demo for that but it's FIFA now but it might be another game later on that you are interested in right yeah I think

17:12.546 --> 17:21.489
[SPEAKER_05]: The genre of games that really stands out to me is that could really take advantage of this are free-to-play MMOs where you don't have to bog down your system with a bunch of crap to install it.

17:21.529 --> 17:28.231
[SPEAKER_05]: You just log into a portal and it's all streamed to you because that's a great way to get the soccer moms or whatever to play because they don't need a graphics card.

17:28.251 --> 17:29.332
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all rendered off-site.

17:29.792 --> 17:32.893
[SPEAKER_05]: So free MMOs and game demos I could see really taking advantage of this.

17:33.013 --> 17:39.435
[SPEAKER_05]: But for the kind of games that we like to play, I don't know, like Arkham City or whatever, you're going to need an installation.

17:40.235 --> 17:42.458
[SPEAKER_05]: on a local device, whether it's a console or PC.

17:43.098 --> 17:47.082
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, I think for free MMOs or freemium, this is great technology.

17:49.844 --> 17:53.225
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we're going to move on into our gaming weeks and the stuff that we've been playing this week.

17:53.265 --> 17:54.646
[SPEAKER_08]: A couple other quick, quick announcements.

17:54.686 --> 17:58.968
[SPEAKER_08]: I forgot to get this out there earlier, but I see some of you guys in chat room are like, I'm voting in the podcast awards.

17:59.008 --> 17:59.208
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay.

17:59.488 --> 18:00.668
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you guys so much for doing that.

18:00.988 --> 18:08.591
[SPEAKER_08]: I did want to mention one of the other members of the OL Army, Brad from PodCulture, has a show in his network that's nominated, and we want to throw our support behind him.

18:08.972 --> 18:13.133
[SPEAKER_08]: He is with a show called The Geek Spin, and it's nominated in PodSafe Music.

18:13.433 --> 18:15.134
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it might just be called Music in the awards.

18:15.154 --> 18:15.554
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't remember.

18:15.574 --> 18:16.375
[SPEAKER_08]: It's either PodSafe.

18:16.415 --> 18:17.015
[SPEAKER_08]: It's PodSafe.

18:17.655 --> 18:18.656
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki's been voting for it every day.

18:18.896 --> 18:20.456
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's the geek spin.

18:20.536 --> 18:24.678
[SPEAKER_08]: And so as you're filling out your ballot, because you can vote in one category, you can vote in multiple.

18:24.959 --> 18:32.022
[SPEAKER_08]: Unless there's just some other pod safe music podcast you just really freaking love, we'd appreciate if you'd throw your support to a fellow member of the OL Army.

18:32.062 --> 18:33.222
[SPEAKER_08]: If we can't win, maybe he can.

18:33.242 --> 18:34.203
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be pretty cool.

18:35.234 --> 18:36.355
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that was it.

18:37.236 --> 18:40.999
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's move on to our gaming weeks and the video games that you have been playing this week.

18:41.359 --> 18:42.460
[SPEAKER_08]: Salacious Pop, we'll start with you.

18:43.901 --> 18:49.105
[SPEAKER_05]: Mostly World of Warcraft, of course, and I guessed it on your other podcast to talk about that.

18:49.245 --> 18:53.889
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll get to it in a minute, but obviously lots of big World of Warcraft news came out.

18:54.189 --> 18:55.170
[SPEAKER_05]: So I played a lot of that.

18:55.470 --> 18:57.532
[SPEAKER_05]: It's in the middle of the Halloween holiday season.

18:58.212 --> 19:03.914
[SPEAKER_05]: I also had an opportunity to play on the PS3 your Sega Genesis arcade collection.

19:03.974 --> 19:10.636
[SPEAKER_05]: I was playing a lot of Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine because someone had commented on how fucking hard that game is.

19:11.517 --> 19:15.238
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I know it's a licensed clone of Puyo Puyo.

19:15.258 --> 19:16.298
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not really Ripoff.

19:16.878 --> 19:18.859
[SPEAKER_05]: They just re-skinned it with their permission.

19:19.059 --> 19:19.780
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

19:37.561 --> 19:40.684
[SPEAKER_05]: and... Isn't that game a really good deal for like 20 bucks?

19:40.804 --> 19:42.325
[SPEAKER_08]: Because that's what it goes for now, is 20 bucks.

19:42.505 --> 19:45.068
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a little mini rant, because I know you like those.

19:45.448 --> 19:55.977
[SPEAKER_05]: What I love about the Genesis, the Sonic's Best of Genesis collection is that there is some production and polish in how it looks when you load up the disc, but it's mostly just...

19:56.417 --> 19:56.918
[SPEAKER_05]: A list.

19:57.298 --> 19:59.500
[SPEAKER_05]: Here are the ROMs that are on this.

19:59.600 --> 20:03.484
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's a nice, pretty, you know, background screen to list everything out in.

20:03.524 --> 20:06.587
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you just pick the game that you want and it loads up.

20:07.268 --> 20:11.432
[SPEAKER_05]: Unlike another collection that we had an opportunity to play

20:11.892 --> 20:13.713
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

20:37.927 --> 20:57.342
[SPEAKER_05]: and maybe I'm just an old curmudgeon now but I know there's a lot of controversy about repackaging retro content for a $40 disc when it's just shit that you played when you were 15 or however young you know in the 90s on your Sega Genesis releasing that content on a disc just give me a menu show me that you put some effort into packaging it

20:57.982 --> 20:59.804
[SPEAKER_05]: and just let me pick it from a list.

21:00.084 --> 21:01.045
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm easy to please.

21:01.225 --> 21:04.447
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, and if they want to do the frou-frou stuff, fine, but they should have an easy way.

21:04.508 --> 21:13.575
[SPEAKER_08]: And another thing I liked about the Genesis Collection versus the Namco Megamix, the Genesis Collection has the extra interviews, it has arcade games you can unlock.

21:13.895 --> 21:18.999
[SPEAKER_08]: There's things that you can work towards that aren't too distracting or terrible.

21:19.040 --> 21:21.121
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?

21:21.161 --> 21:27.887
[SPEAKER_05]: So loading up the Namco Museum and direct Pac-Man to find the game that you want that's in one of these candy-shaped buildings.

21:28.447 --> 21:32.191
[SPEAKER_08]: There's also one other big difference between the Megamix and the Sega Genesis Collection, to be fair.

21:32.551 --> 21:35.253
[SPEAKER_08]: And that is that they have all these new versions of games.

21:35.774 --> 21:41.639
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the ones I played was Rally-X, which has now Pac-Man in the car dodging not ghosts, but just...

21:42.659 --> 21:42.999
[SPEAKER_05]: Boogers.

21:43.260 --> 21:45.101
[SPEAKER_08]: Just boogers and other cars.

21:45.442 --> 21:49.686
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's kind of like a 3D version of Rally X, which kind of ruins the charm of the original game.

21:50.006 --> 21:57.393
[SPEAKER_08]: Like old school 2D games from 1983 don't translate well into 3D on the Wii if you don't change a lot.

21:57.553 --> 21:58.314
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?

21:59.836 --> 22:01.077
[SPEAKER_08]: The whole thing felt derpy to me.

22:01.963 --> 22:10.969
[SPEAKER_05]: And I want to give a shout out to DDR Dollar Bill in chat because he said that his gaming week was City of Heroes and they just launched their freemium free-to-play model.

22:11.230 --> 22:11.990
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, did that happen?

22:12.090 --> 22:18.554
[SPEAKER_05]: Which included a cataclysm-like redesign of the starter zones, maybe a minor graphical upgrade.

22:18.955 --> 22:23.698
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm not really in a situation where I can check that out right now, but I'm just City of Heroes love.

22:23.798 --> 22:24.719
[SPEAKER_05]: I played that game for years.

22:24.739 --> 22:25.259
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm surprised.

22:25.519 --> 22:27.040
[SPEAKER_08]: Why aren't you getting into that?

22:27.080 --> 22:28.181
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it just too much wow?

22:29.021 --> 22:29.422
[SPEAKER_08]: It's free.

22:29.722 --> 22:30.663
[SPEAKER_08]: It runs on your computer, right?

22:30.863 --> 22:31.003
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

22:31.683 --> 22:32.803
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm surprised you're not checking it out.

22:33.784 --> 22:41.106
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me ask you this question too before you wrap up your gaming week because unlike the other show, the people that listen to this show, not everybody's into WoW.

22:41.126 --> 22:43.066
[SPEAKER_08]: In fact, some people quite frankly hate it.

22:43.466 --> 22:44.767
[SPEAKER_08]: So why do you play WoW?

22:47.267 --> 22:56.310
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, what got me onto WoW originally was finding out how many gamer friends that I never really got to see in FaceTime were already playing on a certain server and it was the social aspect of it.

22:56.950 --> 22:57.110
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

22:59.881 --> 23:28.008
[SPEAKER_05]: being able to interact with people that I know and it's very immersive there's definitely stuff to do it's the industry leader for subscriptions for a reason even though that's dwindling which we'll get to in a minute with a future story but I played the hell out of Warcraft 3 and I knew I played the RTS campaign where the Scourge is there and Glitch King and blah blah blah so I didn't hop onto the WoW train immediately because I was still playing City of Heroes to be honest so all right

23:29.419 --> 23:30.741
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

23:30.761 --> 23:31.521
[SPEAKER_08]: I only played Grand Theft Auto.

23:36.144 --> 23:36.604
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it?

23:37.104 --> 23:38.465
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's pretty much it.

23:38.485 --> 23:41.565
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't get in time to play much of anything else.

23:41.785 --> 23:50.648
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think I played any Dead Rising 2 off the record this week.

23:51.048 --> 23:53.768
[SPEAKER_08]: Gosh, you make it sound like you have a baby or something that takes all your time.

23:54.549 --> 23:56.149
[SPEAKER_06]: No, actually it wasn't the baby that took all my time.

23:56.209 --> 23:58.130
[SPEAKER_06]: It was modding Grand Theft Auto that took all my time.

23:58.170 --> 23:58.810
[SPEAKER_08]: Modding Grand Theft Auto?

23:58.830 --> 24:00.090
[SPEAKER_08]: What are you doing to Grand Theft Auto right now?

24:00.690 --> 24:02.171
[SPEAKER_06]: Just discovering new stuff.

24:02.911 --> 24:03.711
[SPEAKER_06]: New texting games.

24:04.071 --> 24:05.391
[SPEAKER_06]: New techniques on how to do things.

24:06.292 --> 24:06.812
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

24:07.192 --> 24:08.532
[SPEAKER_06]: And it really occupied all my time.

24:09.753 --> 24:10.033
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

24:10.873 --> 24:11.313
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

24:11.453 --> 24:12.293
[SPEAKER_08]: My gaming week.

24:13.153 --> 24:16.354
[SPEAKER_08]: I was playing Warcraft as well, because you guys all know I'm into that.

24:16.594 --> 24:19.555
[SPEAKER_08]: Final Fantasy XIV, I'm still kind of juggling the two games a little bit.

24:20.335 --> 24:23.076
[SPEAKER_08]: And I stand by what I said about the game last week.

24:23.116 --> 24:30.238
[SPEAKER_08]: It's getting better, but there's still a lot of room for improvement, and I'm probably not going to pay for it unless some miracle patch makes the game really...

24:30.538 --> 24:47.362
[SPEAKER_08]: and I think a lot of what is ruining Final Fantasy XIV for me the more I play it is that I see how other MMOs including WoW like to put in a lot of quality of life improvements but I feel like the Japanese developers have no concept of what a quality of life improvement is

24:48.022 --> 24:53.026
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm talking about games I see developed over there versus games I see developed over here.

24:53.126 --> 25:01.753
[SPEAKER_08]: In order to do certain quests and stuff, I spend 10 minutes running from point A to point B. How is that fun to just run?

25:01.813 --> 25:08.939
[SPEAKER_08]: I think if they are going to redesign their game, they really need to think about how do we make the game non-stop fun?

25:10.080 --> 25:13.523
[SPEAKER_08]: That's... Because when the game's good, it's pretty good.

25:13.903 --> 25:16.546
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, you know, the battle systems, actually, it's really neat to look at.

25:16.646 --> 25:17.246
[SPEAKER_08]: It's different.

25:17.507 --> 25:20.529
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to think about positioning of your characters as well as what you're doing.

25:20.549 --> 25:22.611
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it's very much unlike WoW, and I like that.

25:22.931 --> 25:24.012
[SPEAKER_08]: It makes a nice break from WoW.

25:24.032 --> 25:26.955
[SPEAKER_08]: And the storytelling is awesome, and the cutscenes are great.

25:27.475 --> 25:27.735
[SPEAKER_08]: But...

25:28.736 --> 25:33.480
[SPEAKER_08]: When the game is in its downtime, its dead time, it's really dead.

25:33.620 --> 25:38.364
[SPEAKER_08]: If I didn't have a link shell of people to talk to, I would poke my eyes out from boredom.

25:38.824 --> 25:44.709
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I hope the developers are really going to think about how the game can be thrilling for 10 minutes as opposed to every 10 minutes.

25:45.353 --> 26:00.657
[SPEAKER_05]: It sort of reminds me of the argument of what Japanese gamers want versus American gamers, especially with JRPGs and how they're kind of tedious and min-maxy and how they just supposedly love that over there, whereas here we're more... I kind of think that's a cop-out.

26:00.737 --> 26:05.179
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think people here truly understand what people like over there and vice versa.

26:05.339 --> 26:09.160
[SPEAKER_08]: I think sometimes people make excuses like, oh, it's a cultural thing.

26:09.520 --> 26:10.480
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a cultural thing.

26:12.421 --> 26:12.761
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

26:13.041 --> 26:22.088
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, because I heard that those lineage MMOs, which are huge over in that part of the world, are very kind of dry to play, like the grinding that you have to do.

26:22.288 --> 26:24.709
[SPEAKER_05]: But again, I've never played it, so I'm mostly talking out of my ass.

26:24.990 --> 26:29.953
[SPEAKER_08]: And I wonder if it's one of those things, again, where kind of like you in WoW, you know, your friends are there, so you just play it.

26:30.013 --> 26:30.554
[SPEAKER_08]: It's your thing.

26:31.074 --> 26:37.418
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, if all my friends suddenly dropped WoW and went to Final Fantasy XIV, I have to reconsider what I'm saying.

26:37.679 --> 26:40.801
[SPEAKER_08]: Because at least in my 10 minutes of run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run,

26:41.121 --> 26:41.762
[SPEAKER_08]: All over the place.

26:42.182 --> 26:45.304
[SPEAKER_08]: Which is what, when Salacious Pop sees me playing Final Fantasy XIV, that's what he does.

26:45.324 --> 26:49.768
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you play a little sprightling hobbit, halfling little... Lalafell.

26:50.028 --> 26:50.528
[SPEAKER_05]: Lalafell.

26:50.548 --> 26:56.853
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's this cute little munchkin thing and his little legs kick when he runs and he does a lot of running to run from town to town.

26:57.214 --> 27:02.398
[SPEAKER_05]: So I see his little wiggly legs tearing across the countryside and run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run.

27:03.996 --> 27:11.125
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkTetsuya was disappointed that Loki didn't play Skylanders this week, so what's up with Skylanders?

27:20.956 --> 27:31.363
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have any sales data yet, and I was just checking on that, because the VG charts only has up through the 15th, and they came out on the 16th, so there's nothing yet.

27:31.483 --> 27:32.163
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll know soon.

27:32.323 --> 27:39.347
[SPEAKER_08]: But I mean, based on the report I heard last week from a retail, I mean, that's just one retail person in one store, but it seems to be selling well.

27:39.367 --> 27:47.052
[SPEAKER_08]: But then again, I went to Target, and I saw plenty of copies of the game and all the little dollies, which I got to admit, there was a moment where I kind of went,

27:49.381 --> 27:53.167
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I just heard Loki in my brain going, No!

27:55.470 --> 27:55.771
[SPEAKER_08]: Listen.

27:55.791 --> 27:56.973
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh-oh.

27:58.875 --> 27:59.716
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

28:19.429 --> 28:20.470
[SPEAKER_06]: And a portal.

28:43.021 --> 28:43.462
[SPEAKER_06]: Play the game.

28:43.522 --> 28:44.162
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, seriously.

28:45.523 --> 28:51.989
[SPEAKER_06]: You start off with three figures, and it's three different elements, I guess.

28:52.330 --> 28:54.431
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a total of eight different elements in the game.

28:54.471 --> 28:59.696
[SPEAKER_06]: In order to see everything in the game, you have to buy all eight elements.

29:00.537 --> 29:07.003
[SPEAKER_06]: And so you only have three characters to start off with, so that's another $40 you've got to spend to see everything that's in the game.

29:07.623 --> 29:11.728
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, then you also have to buy the expansions to see what's in there as well.

29:11.788 --> 29:14.691
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's another, you know, $40 on top of that.

29:14.751 --> 29:15.853
[SPEAKER_06]: So $80 right there.

29:15.873 --> 29:20.558
[SPEAKER_08]: But to be fair, I mean, there's a lot of video games that have download content.

29:20.578 --> 29:23.922
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you want to see it all, quote unquote, you know, all the levels and stuff.

29:24.122 --> 29:27.224
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, that's fair that a lot of games have download content.

29:27.524 --> 29:30.026
[SPEAKER_06]: But to see everything on the disc, I don't have to spend another $40.

29:32.847 --> 29:37.650
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is $40 on top of a game that's already too expensive as it is.

29:38.350 --> 29:47.296
[SPEAKER_06]: And then on top of that, to entice kids to beg their parents for more characters, you can unlock abilities for characters you don't own.

29:47.716 --> 29:49.237
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there's an ability...

29:49.497 --> 29:54.681
[SPEAKER_06]: It basically shows you a preview video of how awesome that character is and how badly you need it.

29:55.962 --> 29:58.905
[SPEAKER_08]: It's to get kids to say, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, I want, I want, I want.

29:59.705 --> 30:04.790
[SPEAKER_05]: I've driven to four fucking targets looking for this figurine for Skylanders and I can't find it.

30:05.717 --> 30:11.138
[SPEAKER_08]: And I see a lot of these blogging sites or whatever talking about how expensive it would be to buy everything and how it's like $300 or something like that.

30:11.158 --> 30:12.319
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you're right up to a point.

30:12.339 --> 30:12.639
[SPEAKER_08]: That's wave one.

30:28.703 --> 30:29.844
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

30:47.825 --> 30:50.429
[SPEAKER_08]: Going to our chat room, and I apologize if I'm mispronouncing this name.

30:50.449 --> 30:57.500
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's Zezbi, Zizbi, in our chat room, says, My mom bought this for my eight-year-old brother for his birthday.

30:57.841 --> 30:59.263
[SPEAKER_08]: I tried to get her to return it.

30:59.463 --> 31:02.348
[SPEAKER_08]: I then cried because she is now a tool and I can't prevent it.

31:02.779 --> 31:03.419
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, here's the thing.

31:03.559 --> 31:06.160
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have a problem with people buying download content for the game.

31:06.260 --> 31:19.922
[SPEAKER_06]: If this was, say, for example, a game that didn't have any toys whatsoever, and they had a total of 30 characters, but each one cost a buck on, you know, the PlayStation Arc, yeah, that would still be stupid, but buying a character for a dollar, not that bad.

31:20.182 --> 31:26.524
[SPEAKER_06]: Buying a stupid inanimate object that's $8 and it doesn't do anything, and I saw a lot of, like...

31:28.297 --> 31:29.920
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, Kotaku, gotta love them.

31:30.020 --> 31:33.467
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, one of their excuses, well, see, these toys are awesome.

31:33.527 --> 31:35.451
[SPEAKER_06]: My kids are playing chess with them.

31:37.145 --> 31:38.025
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

31:59.372 --> 32:00.712
[SPEAKER_06]: It's seriously a cash grab.

32:00.932 --> 32:04.633
[SPEAKER_06]: And if it's successful, you can bet that there's going to be more of this shit later on.

32:04.693 --> 32:07.874
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't need another 30-minute opening segment about Skylanders.

32:08.194 --> 32:09.955
[SPEAKER_08]: So can I move on and talk about the last game of my week?

32:10.215 --> 32:14.816
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's talk about Cash Grab 2, a bargain basement game that's pretty good for your value.

32:14.876 --> 32:22.057
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's seriously right up the frickin' alley of the people that listen to this show, at least the ones that started with us and all that, because it's a music-based game.

32:22.918 --> 32:27.779
[SPEAKER_08]: A game I bought this week on Steam that just went on sale, I believe, over the weekend is a game called Sequence.

32:28.719 --> 32:33.282
[SPEAKER_08]: and it is, get this, it's a DDR role-playing game.

32:34.103 --> 32:40.727
[SPEAKER_08]: It's DDR mixed, but not like the actual DDR game, but it's that whole idea, the Falling Arrows mixed with a role-playing game.

32:41.127 --> 32:44.970
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's $4.50 right now on Steam, which I think the regular price is going to be $5.

32:45.070 --> 32:48.532
[SPEAKER_06]: I also believe, if I remember correctly, it's also an Xbox indie game.

32:48.592 --> 32:48.832
[SPEAKER_06]: It is.

32:48.912 --> 32:56.317
[SPEAKER_08]: It started as an Xbox Live indie game, but once the Cthulhu people went over to Steam and were like, shit, we made more money in a day on Steam.

32:56.337 --> 32:57.818
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, exactly.

32:58.018 --> 32:59.119
[SPEAKER_08]: Rock Band for the DS or the PSP

33:21.477 --> 33:24.499
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, kind of, I guess you could say, except like... It's all you.

33:24.859 --> 33:28.101
[SPEAKER_08]: One won't stop just because you get a perfect note pattern in one.

33:28.502 --> 33:30.983
[SPEAKER_08]: One of them is for defending or preventing damage.

33:31.384 --> 33:32.845
[SPEAKER_08]: One of them is for casting spells.

33:33.005 --> 33:35.006
[SPEAKER_08]: One of them is for regenerating mana for your spells.

33:35.426 --> 33:38.809
[SPEAKER_08]: And the way it all works together, I gotta admit, is really cool.

33:39.209 --> 33:42.691
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, the whole design of the game, it's something kind of new.

33:43.112 --> 33:46.614
[SPEAKER_08]: It's mixing two genres together that I think people are into.

33:46.734 --> 33:51.137
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think for people that enjoy music games or role-playing games, you've gotta see what they've done here.

33:52.659 --> 33:56.184
[SPEAKER_08]: It is a $5 game, and so it has the production values of a $5 game.

33:56.604 --> 34:01.111
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of the voice acting leaves some things to be desired.

34:01.572 --> 34:03.494
[SPEAKER_08]: But the writing is actually very witty.

34:03.895 --> 34:04.656
[SPEAKER_08]: It's very witty.

34:04.736 --> 34:07.139
[SPEAKER_08]: You can tell there's a lot of inspiration from GLaDOS.

34:07.680 --> 34:09.581
[SPEAKER_08]: It's very modern, the game.

34:11.241 --> 34:13.002
[SPEAKER_08]: So I like kind of what they've done with that.

34:13.962 --> 34:16.163
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not criticizing the voice actors.

34:16.183 --> 34:31.668
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just saying the way the voice acting is delivered, it really sounds like the two were recorded, at least in the stages I've played, the intercom gal and the main character that you play, it's kind of obvious the two were recorded separately because they don't ever talk on top of each other.

34:31.708 --> 34:34.029
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't have a natural interaction with each other.

34:34.529 --> 34:54.328
[SPEAKER_08]: and maybe I'm just kind of picky when it comes to stuff like that but I just you know I noticed it but I'm not going to say like oh my god the game is like worthless because the voice acting was not done professionally no it's the game itself it's neat and it's the kind of thing where I go I really want to see what they're going to do with a sequel

34:55.359 --> 34:59.281
[SPEAKER_08]: Because, you know, again, when I say role-playing game, unfortunately, there's no overworld.

34:59.541 --> 35:00.462
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no map.

35:00.822 --> 35:03.183
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just you kind of choose from a menu.

35:03.243 --> 35:05.024
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you want to go out and battle another creature?

35:05.305 --> 35:10.367
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you want to work on synthesis to get more items so you are better defended and have more hit points?

35:10.788 --> 35:15.630
[SPEAKER_08]: Or do you want to work on, you know, what kind of stuff do you want to do from within this room?

35:15.891 --> 35:21.134
[SPEAKER_08]: So I feel like with this concept, there's so much more that can be done with it if people will just throw money at it.

35:22.154 --> 35:22.775
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

35:41.953 --> 35:47.656
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of, you know, it's not really like pop music or anything like that.

35:47.716 --> 35:54.420
[SPEAKER_08]: It's very like video gamey, you know, kind of indie artist type stuff, but it's not bad by any means.

35:54.540 --> 36:02.764
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, because my brain is still preoccupied, I tell you, it takes a lot to like be thinking in the concept of, okay, I'm playing over here.

36:02.964 --> 36:03.484
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

36:32.932 --> 36:35.613
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, that does it for our gaming weeks.

36:35.854 --> 36:39.155
[SPEAKER_08]: So I want to quickly plug a few Orange Lounge Radio related things.

36:39.195 --> 36:40.376
[SPEAKER_08]: And that would be our Facebook.

36:40.416 --> 36:43.057
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're not our friend on Facebook, why not?

36:43.177 --> 36:44.278
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't you want to have another friend?

36:44.658 --> 36:45.298
[SPEAKER_08]: Orange Lounge Radio.

36:45.338 --> 36:48.520
[SPEAKER_08]: Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio is the place to add us on Facebook.

36:48.780 --> 36:50.161
[SPEAKER_08]: You can also follow us on the Twitters.

36:50.621 --> 37:07.963
[SPEAKER_08]: Twitter.com slash OLR We will be taking your Twitter comments a little later on in the show Twitter.com slash OLR If you want to send us some app messages with your thoughts on anything you're hearing about on tonight's program Let's get into some news Loki's going to start us off tonight

37:09.198 --> 37:15.822
[SPEAKER_06]: So the PlayStation Vita's got a release date now for Europe and North America and I guess the Middle East and Australia.

37:17.082 --> 37:17.522
[SPEAKER_06]: February 22nd.

37:17.542 --> 37:20.184
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of odd, that's a Wednesday.

37:21.324 --> 37:24.186
[SPEAKER_06]: Odd release date, but yeah, it'll be coming out.

37:24.206 --> 37:27.607
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, they are quick to remind you that it's $249.99 without 3G and $299.99 with 3G.

37:27.627 --> 37:29.088
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly, I'd just stick without 3G and...

37:36.428 --> 37:38.791
[SPEAKER_06]: Tether to my phone if I really want 3G.

37:39.572 --> 37:40.694
[SPEAKER_06]: Although I don't think I'll ever.

37:40.934 --> 37:42.997
[SPEAKER_08]: But Loki, I must game on the go.

37:45.320 --> 37:50.547
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's a good idea if you want to do 3... I just don't know what the data plans are with that.

37:50.608 --> 37:53.031
[SPEAKER_06]: And 3G stuff, you know, it...

37:54.258 --> 38:06.865
[SPEAKER_06]: Have they really announced... Is this something where I can take it to any provider that has 3G and say, hey, I want my PlayStation Vita to run on your service?

38:06.885 --> 38:10.827
[SPEAKER_06]: Because this isn't like the iPhone or anything where, hey, it's certain...

38:12.128 --> 38:13.669
[SPEAKER_06]: Certain places will give it to you.

38:13.829 --> 38:17.632
[SPEAKER_06]: And also, the other thing you might want to wait and see is if they do have some sort of data plan.

38:18.252 --> 38:24.456
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of times, usually with the iPads and phones and stuff like that, they'll offer you some sort of discount on the system.

38:24.516 --> 38:29.740
[SPEAKER_06]: So you might want to wait and see what the providers announce.

38:31.061 --> 38:33.582
[SPEAKER_06]: Some new launch titles have also been announced.

38:33.662 --> 38:36.204
[SPEAKER_06]: Coming from Namco, of course, Ridge Racer.

38:37.145 --> 38:40.147
[SPEAKER_06]: Ridge Racer, serving the launches of systems since the beginning of time.

38:42.208 --> 38:47.430
[SPEAKER_06]: Shinobito, and Touch My Katamari.

38:48.830 --> 38:51.691
[SPEAKER_06]: Those will be coming alongside the Vita in North America.

38:51.751 --> 38:53.211
[SPEAKER_08]: Touch My Katamari, really?

38:53.651 --> 38:56.072
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I believe that's actually coming out already.

38:56.612 --> 39:03.454
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, obviously the Vita is launching a little bit earlier in Japan, but I believe it's also with their launch as well.

39:04.794 --> 39:06.555
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that a bowling minigame I see there?

39:07.577 --> 39:15.889
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think it's a minigame, I think it's just part of what you roll up I like Katamari I'd play that

39:17.629 --> 39:23.452
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I mean, the Katamari franchise has been kind of meh ever since the creator left, but I don't know.

39:23.492 --> 39:24.012
[SPEAKER_08]: You never know.

39:24.032 --> 39:29.854
[SPEAKER_08]: There might always be that renaissance Katamari game that's a lot of fun again.

39:30.154 --> 39:33.956
[SPEAKER_08]: The one on PlayStation 3 wasn't bad, but it was also kind of a rehash of all the old games.

39:34.396 --> 39:36.257
[SPEAKER_08]: It was like a best hits of Katamari.

39:36.377 --> 39:42.459
[SPEAKER_06]: And knowing Namco, I wouldn't be surprised if this is a rehash of a rehash of a rehash of a rehash.

39:42.480 --> 39:43.440
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

39:45.596 --> 39:45.917
[SPEAKER_06]: Who knows?

39:46.997 --> 39:51.021
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's kind of neat.

39:51.141 --> 39:52.622
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you think you're going to get one of these at launch?

39:52.882 --> 39:53.463
[SPEAKER_08]: I know I am.

39:53.643 --> 39:54.624
[SPEAKER_08]: I really don't have a choice.

39:55.364 --> 39:58.067
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to, but it all depends on how much money I get.

39:59.268 --> 40:02.270
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think I could probably scrounge up that kind of dough.

40:02.731 --> 40:05.533
[SPEAKER_06]: I will definitely be setting the money aside to get it.

40:05.573 --> 40:05.973
[SPEAKER_06]: I got to.

40:06.394 --> 40:06.794
[SPEAKER_06]: Got to have it.

40:07.094 --> 40:14.600
[SPEAKER_06]: I just, you know, the reason I want it is because I think they're going to do a Grand Theft Auto game for it, and I gotta have a Grand Theft Auto game.

40:14.620 --> 40:21.164
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, Grand Theft Auto on PSP, we actually, we were kind of talking about it, especially since they've been showing the, you know, Grand Theft Auto 3 stuff.

40:21.204 --> 40:31.252
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, man, it'd be fun to go back and play Liberty City Stories again, but that game was really old, and it would be such a learning curve again.

40:33.872 --> 40:36.113
[SPEAKER_08]: Salacious Pop, how do you feel about the PlayStation Vita?

40:36.213 --> 40:43.215
[SPEAKER_08]: I know you don't exactly probably want to run out and buy one day one, but let's say you had the disposable income.

40:43.275 --> 40:45.455
[SPEAKER_08]: Is this something that calls to you?

40:45.735 --> 40:46.195
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.

40:46.255 --> 40:47.355
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a sexy piece of hardware.

40:47.555 --> 40:49.816
[SPEAKER_05]: I like how it looks.

40:50.496 --> 40:52.217
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't know you felt so strongly about it.

40:52.577 --> 40:52.857
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's...

40:55.237 --> 40:56.698
[SPEAKER_05]: do you have feelings for the PlayStation Vita?

40:56.718 --> 41:19.687
[SPEAKER_05]: the PSP for me was I think it's an underrated piece of hardware because the DS of course just mud stomped everything in the handheld market and the PSP is a competent little nice device that displays well and is a great system I think the Vita again is going to be a nice piece of technology but the 3DS hasn't really started to wreck people yet

41:19.927 --> 41:21.328
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the thing about the 3DS, too.

41:21.368 --> 41:28.552
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, we don't really know, aside from the ever-delayed Kid Icarus, what's really their plan beyond 2011.

41:28.972 --> 41:33.095
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's just like, hey, we got Kid Icarus, because that's been delayed forever.

41:34.095 --> 41:39.979
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they've got the two Mario games that are going to be coming out this holiday, but they haven't really said too much.

41:41.119 --> 41:45.522
[SPEAKER_06]: There was stuff at E3 and some other conference, but I don't remember any of that damn shit.

41:45.922 --> 41:50.345
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, since they're not keeping it fresh in my mind, that makes me think that they don't really have a plan.

41:50.986 --> 41:58.831
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're really going to need a plan when the Vita comes out because, you know, people may think otherwise.

41:58.851 --> 42:02.534
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we do have expansion firmware related news coming up later.

42:02.594 --> 42:03.294
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, it's...

42:05.535 --> 42:06.056
[SPEAKER_08]: It's upgrades.

42:06.476 --> 42:07.756
[SPEAKER_05]: It's upgrades from what's there now.

42:08.176 --> 42:14.858
[SPEAKER_05]: One thing that I think might keep some people from buying a Vita is that, kind of like the PSP, it's almost too nice.

42:15.659 --> 42:18.740
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's say you can afford the price point.

42:19.120 --> 42:23.181
[SPEAKER_05]: It's such a nice piece of hardware, but it's like, I don't want to put this in my pocket or carry this around.

42:23.201 --> 42:23.561
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a nice...

42:25.782 --> 42:27.003
[SPEAKER_05]: Spaghing to get me mugged.

42:46.491 --> 42:53.257
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and it's weird that it almost looks too nice of a piece of thing that you want to take outside the house.

42:53.377 --> 42:53.698
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

42:53.978 --> 43:00.404
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now, the launch games, there's not really much been announced because they didn't really know when the date of the Vita was.

43:00.464 --> 43:04.688
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know there's maybe four or five games that I actually know that are coming out at launch right now.

43:05.669 --> 43:07.610
[SPEAKER_06]: Some I don't even know if they've been announced yet, but like...

43:09.335 --> 43:12.196
[SPEAKER_06]: Lego Harry Potter, which I... Yippee!

43:12.316 --> 43:13.076
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not for me.

43:13.997 --> 43:16.597
[SPEAKER_06]: Army Corps of Hell, that looks pretty cool.

43:16.757 --> 43:22.779
[SPEAKER_06]: Dragon's Crown, and... Well, Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3.

43:24.280 --> 43:32.943
[SPEAKER_08]: But at least, kind of like a point you brought up with Nintendo, we don't really know what they're doing beyond a year, but with the PlayStation Vita, we know, like, hey, Final Fantasy X is coming at some point.

43:33.183 --> 43:33.263
[SPEAKER_08]: And...

43:34.443 --> 43:42.487
[SPEAKER_06]: And with the Vita, I gotta say, the launch lineup is looking a hell of a lot better, even with not much announced already than the 3DS launch.

43:44.127 --> 43:58.634
[SPEAKER_05]: And also with the 3DS, there's still, and this is gonna come up later in the show, there's still that weirdness with that button, that right analog add-on, which is coming to America, which we're gonna bring up later, and does that mean that we're gonna get a new device altogether?

43:59.974 --> 44:03.496
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like that awkward friend you don't really want to invite over, but you kind of have to.

44:07.112 --> 44:09.133
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so there's a lot in the air right now for the 3DS.

44:29.146 --> 44:32.669
[SPEAKER_08]: The huge, huge MMO World of Warcraft had a new expansion announced.

44:32.729 --> 44:34.811
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the Mists of Pandaria.

44:35.431 --> 44:48.702
[SPEAKER_08]: This was the name that had earlier been rumored thanks to a trademark filing earlier in the year, but it was confirmed that the Pandarans, yes, that's panda people, will be the new playable race in WoW for both the Alliance and the Horde.

44:48.722 --> 44:51.604
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going to be choosing at level 10 which side you're going to go on.

44:51.624 --> 44:52.345
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's the first race.

44:52.365 --> 44:56.168
[SPEAKER_08]: So they're going to finally add, like, you know, slash Panda Express now?

44:56.188 --> 44:56.368
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

44:56.508 --> 44:57.069
[SPEAKER_08]: Womp womp

45:14.065 --> 45:38.320
[SPEAKER_08]: Also coming in the expansion, the Monk class, the level cap is raised to level 90 Some brand new endgame things to participate in, a dungeon challenge mode where your item levels will be capped And you're going to go after gold, silver, and bronze medals in the various dungeons in the game That actually sounds really cool, I'm going to be very interested in that PvE scenarios, for people that like the big PvP battlegrounds without their PvP

45:38.920 --> 45:55.505
[SPEAKER_08]: is basically what it sounds like and a new pet battle system that is basically Pokemon Blizzard has realized that a lot of people really like the pet collecting aspect of the game so they're expanding this whole new mini game into it now where you're going to have a Pokemon battle system

45:55.925 --> 46:08.332
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically, you're going to have different talents on your pets and your pets can use three of them at a time and they battle each other and you can even go around the world and fight master trainers to get new abilities.

46:09.092 --> 46:11.894
[SPEAKER_08]: They are not even being shy about what they're ripping off here.

46:12.834 --> 46:14.475
[SPEAKER_05]: If Nintendo ain't gonna do it, then...

46:36.644 --> 46:38.606
[SPEAKER_08]: Supposedly it eats one of the other pets.

46:38.946 --> 46:45.472
[SPEAKER_05]: For Stephen King fans, if you've seen the movie Creepshow, and I know you don't like horror, it's the monster in the crate.

46:45.512 --> 46:46.914
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the creepy crate from Creepshow.

46:47.254 --> 46:47.995
[SPEAKER_05]: That 80s movie.

46:48.095 --> 46:48.755
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what it is.

46:49.596 --> 46:50.477
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I gotcha.

46:51.638 --> 46:51.678
[SPEAKER_08]: Um...

46:53.079 --> 47:00.902
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, apparently there's going to be pets that you can only find out in the world, like at certain times of day or during the spring.

47:01.302 --> 47:04.924
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, wasn't that the kicker in the last Pokemon game on the DS?

47:05.004 --> 47:07.105
[SPEAKER_08]: Like there was Pokemon you can only catch at certain times of day and stuff?

47:08.765 --> 47:11.986
[SPEAKER_06]: If only there were a way to change the time on my DS.

47:13.307 --> 47:14.127
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, wait.

47:14.207 --> 47:18.569
[SPEAKER_08]: Except now you can't change the time on the Blizzard server, so it's going to be interesting to see.

47:19.209 --> 47:23.011
[SPEAKER_05]: I've already seen some people trolling that this is just going to be like the dance studio.

47:23.111 --> 47:25.572
[SPEAKER_05]: They're showing us green caps now, but it's never going to happen.

47:26.693 --> 47:31.995
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it will because what I'm liking about this expansion, I could care less about the panda.

47:32.436 --> 47:33.816
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, the monk sounds interesting.

47:33.836 --> 47:36.398
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll try a monk, but panda people, whatever.

47:36.478 --> 47:36.958
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm over it.

47:37.492 --> 47:57.867
[SPEAKER_08]: but as somebody who doesn't always get a chance to raid because I'm in more of a social guild where I really just want to be with my friends but I could see like a group of about five people in that guild getting really into this stupid pet battle thing so I like that it's giving people something else to do besides dungeons and raids and for that I give them credit

47:58.208 --> 48:06.791
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they've really buffed up stuff for casual players, and also PvP is getting new, entirely new game concepts.

48:06.811 --> 48:07.331
[SPEAKER_05]: Murderball.

48:07.371 --> 48:08.752
[SPEAKER_05]: Murderball and a bunch of other stuff.

48:08.792 --> 48:12.853
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe they should add it to Final Fantasy XIV since there's a lot of waiting for party.

48:13.674 --> 48:14.134
[SPEAKER_08]: You're funny.

48:14.714 --> 48:15.534
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

48:16.095 --> 48:22.077
[SPEAKER_08]: So anyhow, that's pretty much all the big news with World of Warcraft, except one other thing, right, SalaciousPop?

48:22.097 --> 48:22.377
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

48:23.973 --> 48:24.934
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that me or is it Loki?

48:25.254 --> 48:25.734
[SPEAKER_08]: No, that's you.

48:25.935 --> 48:26.255
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

48:27.376 --> 48:27.656
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

48:27.736 --> 48:32.280
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so World of Warcraft at one time had 12 million subscribers, right?

48:32.660 --> 48:33.761
[SPEAKER_05]: Top MMO in the world.

48:34.362 --> 48:38.185
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Blizzard has another game coming out called Diablo 3.

48:39.046 --> 48:49.174
[SPEAKER_05]: And they have this promotion where it's like, all right, how can we do some damage control on the fact that we're hemorrhaging subscriptions and also maybe cross-pollinate our WoW audience with Diablo 3?

48:49.714 --> 48:50.975
[SPEAKER_05]: And what they've come up with is...

48:51.816 --> 48:59.762
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have a WoW license on your Battle.net account as of October 18th, so it's already too late to buy a new WoW license for this.

48:59.842 --> 49:01.923
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is somewhat of a loyalty program.

49:02.023 --> 49:04.265
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's pretty much damage controlled.

49:05.286 --> 49:11.990
[SPEAKER_05]: You agree to a year of WoW billed at the regular $14.99 every 30 days.

49:12.010 --> 49:14.272
[SPEAKER_05]: You're just saying that you're going to do that for 12 months out.

49:14.792 --> 49:17.754
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to get a free digital download license of Diablo 3.

49:19.055 --> 49:38.166
[SPEAKER_05]: you're going to get access to the Mists of Pandaria beta probably the very last stage of it after the everyone who signs up gets to play anyway like after they do friends and family and after the NDA whatever has been lifted so that and you get a Diablo themed pretty badass looking mount for your WoW account in World of Warcraft

49:39.607 --> 49:41.268
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, there are some conditions.

49:41.368 --> 49:44.950
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, you need to have WoW on your Battle.net account as of last Wednesday.

49:45.810 --> 50:05.500
[SPEAKER_05]: In the terms and conditions of the agreement, if you, for whatever reason, your credit card stops working and you don't make your payments, I believe they can pull the Diablo 3 license from your Battle.net account simply because you have to log in to Battle.net because of the real ID and stuff when you play Diablo 3.

50:05.960 --> 50:33.978
[SPEAKER_08]: and Diablo 3 is very controversial because it's going to be online only and now we have now we really we see another reason why which to fuel all that anger that people had before about they can't play Diablo 3 offline now here's another reason why because these people that are going to get the game for free they're going to need to connect every time to make sure their credit cards didn't bounce and just to reiterate if you sign up for this loyalty agreement your cancel button is grayed out you can't cancel it's a cell phone contract in video games it's a

50:35.451 --> 50:58.278
[SPEAKER_05]: and the timing can't be better because if you do this because obviously hell yeah people want Diablo 3 it's going to be one of the biggest games of either next year probably you know we've got Star Wars MMO of the Old Republic coming out Guild Wars 2 and whatever else they're saying you can go play those games if you want but you're paying for WoW for a year regardless so you can have fun we got your money

51:02.581 --> 51:04.703
[SPEAKER_08]: It's genius.

51:04.943 --> 51:08.887
[SPEAKER_08]: It's absolute genius on Blizzard's part is to lock people in.

51:09.267 --> 51:15.573
[SPEAKER_08]: Lock in your loyal customers that are going to say, shit, I'm going to play WoW for the next year anyway and you're going to give me Diablo 3 free?

51:15.773 --> 51:16.754
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck yeah, I'm in.

51:17.154 --> 51:22.639
[SPEAKER_08]: But now you can't make flirty eyes with Star Wars MMO and you can't go off and cheat with Guild Wars 2.

51:22.859 --> 51:24.561
[SPEAKER_05]: You can, you're just paying for both.

51:24.801 --> 51:38.998
[SPEAKER_08]: Blizzard will still have your money you're not going to be tempted to cut WoW for the other and that's I think part of the reason why they're also saying well it's like a loyalty thing you have to already be a customer this is to lock those 11 million people in best they can

51:39.624 --> 51:49.947
[SPEAKER_05]: If you already have a relationship with WoW and you're on the fence as to how long you're going to be with WoW, this is to basically say, pony up, we're going to keep you and this is how we're going to do it.

51:50.388 --> 51:53.949
[SPEAKER_05]: This isn't for people that have been thinking about trying out WoW.

51:54.849 --> 51:57.510
[SPEAKER_05]: This isn't a way to hop on both trains.

51:58.126 --> 51:59.507
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what's interesting about this too?

51:59.567 --> 52:12.275
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't even know if this got brought up on the other show when we were talking about it, but yeah, you're going to get Diablo 3 free, but what else is going to come out while you're locked into this 12-month plan?

52:12.735 --> 52:13.536
[SPEAKER_08]: Mists of Pandaria.

52:14.156 --> 52:19.699
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you really want the full WoW experience that you've now committed to, you're going to have to get Mists of Pandaria.

52:20.800 --> 52:23.802
[SPEAKER_08]: So you may not have to buy Diablo 3, but you're going to have to buy the other game.

52:25.100 --> 52:31.676
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I guess you don't have to, but you know that they're thinking everybody's going to that's locked in if they're locked into their WoW account.

52:32.225 --> 52:40.370
[SPEAKER_05]: For the previous WoW expansion, Wrath of the Lich King, a lot of people killed the Lich King, which was the end boss, supreme raid boss of that expansion.

52:40.710 --> 52:46.734
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they canceled their WoW all through the summer and they didn't sign up until Cataclysm came out in December.

52:46.774 --> 52:48.876
[SPEAKER_05]: So they got to save money by just saying, I'm going to be back.

52:48.916 --> 52:49.896
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just taking five months off.

52:50.256 --> 52:51.517
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't really do that with this.

52:52.098 --> 52:55.019
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't, you know, we killed Deathwing in Cataclysm.

52:55.060 --> 52:58.682
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't quit and come back for Mists of Pandaria if you're paying for this promotion.

52:58.702 --> 52:58.802
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

52:59.582 --> 53:02.603
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to clarify because some folks in chat are talking about how the payment works.

53:02.703 --> 53:03.283
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's the deal.

53:03.783 --> 53:07.384
[SPEAKER_08]: You're not agreeing to any type of payment plan with this.

53:07.745 --> 53:10.365
[SPEAKER_08]: You're agreeing to keep your account current for 12 months.

53:10.745 --> 53:13.966
[SPEAKER_08]: You can still pay with the cards, the prepaid cards.

53:14.286 --> 53:17.167
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you never want to give Blizzard your credit card, apparently you still don't have to.

53:17.207 --> 53:18.388
[SPEAKER_08]: You can use the prepaid cards.

53:19.548 --> 53:19.988
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

53:35.084 --> 53:37.446
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you can't do a 12-month lump sum.

53:37.686 --> 53:40.768
[SPEAKER_08]: I know people are thinking that or that you have to pay that up front, but you can't do 12.

53:41.569 --> 53:44.271
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the same payment methods that were always there.

53:44.611 --> 53:47.153
[SPEAKER_08]: You can do one month at $14.99 a month.

53:47.493 --> 53:50.775
[SPEAKER_08]: You can do three-month lump sum at $13.99 a month.

53:51.175 --> 53:55.718
[SPEAKER_08]: Or you can do what I did, the six-month lump sum at $12.99 a month.

53:55.899 --> 54:01.983
[SPEAKER_08]: So this month I'll have to pay $77, which is going to be six months of WoW, which I know I'm going to be playing anyway because I have the other show.

54:02.764 --> 54:07.156
[SPEAKER_08]: And then in April, around the time I get my tax refund, I'll have to pay the other $77.

54:07.517 --> 54:09.162
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I'll be good for the year.

54:09.383 --> 54:10.847
[SPEAKER_08]: So I kind of figure it'll work.

54:11.109 --> 54:18.772
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's good because I was on the three-month plan because $40 once a quarter is reasonable and it's a dollar off what you'd be paying monthly.

54:19.272 --> 54:22.994
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought that you had to roll over to $14.99 every 30 days with this promotion.

54:23.014 --> 54:23.434
[SPEAKER_05]: No, you do not.

54:23.454 --> 54:24.694
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's great to hear that you can.

54:24.714 --> 54:25.275
[SPEAKER_05]: No, you do not.

54:25.715 --> 54:26.795
[SPEAKER_08]: You can pick.

54:26.835 --> 54:31.737
[SPEAKER_08]: You can still do the three-month, but I think you have to have some type of recurring thing on file.

54:32.177 --> 54:35.699
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you end up using the prepaid cards, then you're fine.

54:36.319 --> 54:39.100
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll never get charged because you keep stocking up with prepaid cards.

54:39.540 --> 54:45.861
[SPEAKER_08]: But obviously, if they're going to give you a $50 game for free, they want to make sure that you're going to make good on your promise.

54:46.681 --> 54:50.882
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I don't see Blizzard sending bill collectors after people if they don't make good on their payments.

54:51.062 --> 54:56.303
[SPEAKER_05]: What if you get Diablo 3 through this promotion and then you make IRL money with the new Diablo 3 Auction House thing?

54:56.323 --> 54:59.523
[SPEAKER_08]: Blizzard will shut that shit down if you don't make good on your payments.

54:59.563 --> 55:00.344
[SPEAKER_08]: That's something to think about.

55:00.784 --> 55:08.365
[SPEAKER_08]: And what I really want to come to with this, I know some of you could give a shit about WoW and Diablo and all that stuff, like Loki probably doesn't really give a shit about this.

55:08.385 --> 55:08.805
[SPEAKER_10]: That is correct.

55:08.985 --> 55:38.205
[SPEAKER_08]: but here's what I do want to say with this and Loki where I can get your opinion is that now that Blizzard has thrown that idea out there precedent has been set precedent has been set imagine it Loki next year sign up for a year of Xbox Live and get free Halo maps PlayStation Plus to an extent is somewhat like this we'll give you free games but the minute you stop paying for PlayStation Plus they're gone

55:39.662 --> 55:41.003
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I could see that.

55:41.264 --> 55:44.847
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I already pay for live, so I don't really care.

55:45.708 --> 55:48.711
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's just my thing, because I do play online every day.

55:49.492 --> 55:50.814
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, almost every day.

55:51.474 --> 55:53.376
[SPEAKER_06]: So, it's not like I can go without it.

55:55.819 --> 55:59.743
[SPEAKER_06]: And I already renew a year prepaid every time, so...

56:01.590 --> 56:02.471
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's cool.

56:02.491 --> 56:04.752
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to give me some more free shit on top of that, cool.

56:04.952 --> 56:09.415
[SPEAKER_06]: I probably don't give a crap about it, especially if it's Halo maps or even Halo a game.

56:09.555 --> 56:11.296
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I don't care.

56:13.197 --> 56:18.901
[SPEAKER_08]: I got to say, though, I mean, I know there's a lot of chatter on the Internet and a lot of people and, of course, a lot of cynicalness about this.

56:19.181 --> 56:21.903
[SPEAKER_08]: And I understand it is, you know, I have to admit.

56:23.123 --> 56:50.776
[SPEAKER_08]: I did have a big hesitation about doing this because it's signing a contract with a video game company that's a little weird to me it's really weird but at the end of the day I realized look I'm gonna pay for this game for a year I know I'm gonna be doing this I have the other show that's not going anywhere anytime soon and I know I'm buying Diablo 3 like I know I'm buying I'm in the beta right now I love it I need more of it I'm gonna buy Diablo 3 so for me this is great it's not for everybody this deal is not for everybody in fact

56:52.256 --> 56:55.757
[SPEAKER_08]: Most people that are probably making fun of this probably aren't even eligible for it anyway.

56:56.097 --> 56:58.118
[SPEAKER_08]: Because you have to be a current WoW subscriber.

56:58.458 --> 56:59.618
[SPEAKER_08]: So this isn't for everybody.

56:59.658 --> 57:02.199
[SPEAKER_08]: This is just Blizzard's way of making sure you're going to stay loyal.

57:02.579 --> 57:05.080
[SPEAKER_08]: And they'll give you a little something extra.

57:05.500 --> 57:07.661
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, at the end of the day, I said, you know what?

57:07.861 --> 57:09.921
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to end up paying for WoW anyway, and I know it.

57:10.241 --> 57:11.442
[SPEAKER_08]: I might as well get Diablo 3 free.

57:12.813 --> 57:15.975
[SPEAKER_08]: By the way, and there's another... Isn't there something a little less on this too?

57:16.215 --> 57:23.980
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I was going to mention Blizzard always puts out very sexy collector's editions, whether it be for a WoW expansion or for StarCraft or whatever.

57:24.720 --> 57:29.543
[SPEAKER_05]: So, of course, Diablo 3 collector's edition is going to have some nice swag in it, some bonus stuff.

57:30.103 --> 57:36.907
[SPEAKER_05]: Namely, the big one is going to be a USB drive with a little Diablo skull caddy that you can put the drive in.

57:37.407 --> 57:39.449
[SPEAKER_05]: And on that drive is Diablo 2, and I believe...

57:40.169 --> 57:41.949
[SPEAKER_05]: It's expansion, at least I would hope so.

57:42.069 --> 57:45.010
[SPEAKER_05]: You can then install off the USB drive or play off the USB drive.

57:45.670 --> 57:52.611
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to get the WoW mount that you would also get for doing this annual subscription with the free copy if you're an existing WoW.

57:52.831 --> 57:53.511
[SPEAKER_05]: So you get the mount.

57:54.291 --> 58:00.292
[SPEAKER_05]: But also, if you're thinking, well, I want to do this 12-month promotion and get the game for free, but that's the standard edition.

58:00.673 --> 58:08.974
[SPEAKER_05]: If I go to Fry's or Best Buy and I'm going to drop $80 for this hella Diablo 3 box edition because it's badass, that's going to screw me over for the promotion.

58:09.855 --> 58:20.347
[SPEAKER_05]: What's going to happen is if you apply that collector's edition code to your Battle.net account with the 12-month promotion thing on it, they're going to add four months free to your WoW subscription.

58:20.908 --> 58:24.132
[SPEAKER_05]: So you are going to make up that money somehow.

58:24.192 --> 58:24.713
[SPEAKER_05]: More WoW!

58:24.753 --> 58:25.414
[SPEAKER_05]: More WoW!

58:25.654 --> 58:27.136
[SPEAKER_08]: Pay 12 months of WoW, get more WoW.

58:27.196 --> 58:28.097
[SPEAKER_08]: So there you go.

58:29.566 --> 58:45.200
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to dwell too much on this, but again, I think the precedent here, don't be surprised if Activision, the parent company, isn't looking at this going, hmm, how could we sell more Skylanders dolls by getting people to commit?

58:45.900 --> 58:47.542
[SPEAKER_08]: How much do you love your Skylanders?

58:49.025 --> 58:49.425
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

58:49.706 --> 58:54.970
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if it would really work with anything other than a subscription service.

58:55.130 --> 59:00.634
[SPEAKER_06]: Because they kind of already do that with Call of Duty Elite.

59:01.054 --> 59:01.975
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a one-year fee.

59:02.375 --> 59:04.557
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not like, hey, you have to sign a contract.

59:05.377 --> 59:06.038
[SPEAKER_06]: We just have one fee.

59:07.199 --> 59:08.800
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

59:08.900 --> 59:11.322
[SPEAKER_06]: They would have to put out more MMOs, I would imagine.

59:12.731 --> 59:14.496
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well let's move on with some more gaming news.

59:14.576 --> 59:14.857
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki.

59:16.983 --> 59:19.169
[SPEAKER_06]: So some non-WOW related stuff.

59:22.133 --> 59:22.933
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

59:52.412 --> 59:59.889
[SPEAKER_06]: and EA we'll be putting that out in 2012 it's going to be put out by EA Tiberian and uh

01:00:01.482 --> 01:00:02.023
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of neat.

01:00:02.103 --> 01:00:09.009
[SPEAKER_06]: They've got pretty much the same gameplay style as before, plus a little bit of Madden Flare thrown in there.

01:00:12.392 --> 01:00:27.445
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess they also say that you have a currency system called Blitz Bucks, where you can boost your teams and modify them in a bunch of different ways, as well as custom modes and loading screens, stat boosting type stuff.

01:00:28.647 --> 01:00:32.350
[SPEAKER_06]: and also custom rosters.

01:00:32.450 --> 01:00:36.574
[SPEAKER_06]: You can set up a survival mode called Blitz Gauntlet.

01:00:37.495 --> 01:00:41.539
[SPEAKER_06]: And I guess that's where you take on several teams back to back.

01:00:42.379 --> 01:00:45.102
[SPEAKER_06]: And then also they have online gameplay as well.

01:00:45.883 --> 01:00:46.884
[SPEAKER_06]: So that should be pretty big.

01:00:48.010 --> 01:00:57.300
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I have to admit, you know, again, I'm not super into sports games, but if I was into a game that was like football, it would be NFL Blitz.

01:00:57.560 --> 01:00:59.462
[SPEAKER_08]: And I like the arcade-y sports games.

01:00:59.502 --> 01:01:01.204
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and it's not too big of a surprise.

01:01:01.224 --> 01:01:03.747
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, come on, they have NBA Jam, so, you know.

01:01:04.848 --> 01:01:08.952
[SPEAKER_06]: And apparently from another article that I read, um...

01:01:10.294 --> 01:01:23.054
[SPEAKER_06]: it actually got leaked out by somebody a while back but it was just kind of one of those an industry insider says this and they didn't really have much to back it up but it did leak out a while back

01:01:25.475 --> 01:01:26.676
[SPEAKER_08]: So the Madden developers are making NFL Blitz now?

01:01:50.565 --> 01:01:50.946
[SPEAKER_08]: Kind of.

01:01:51.406 --> 01:01:55.691
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's not the same team, but it's the same building, pretty much, right?

01:01:55.711 --> 01:01:56.072
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

01:01:56.112 --> 01:01:57.593
[SPEAKER_08]: Kind of just down the hall from each other, right?

01:01:58.254 --> 01:01:58.454
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

01:01:58.975 --> 01:02:03.020
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's not a big surprise, because they've done some different things before.

01:02:03.100 --> 01:02:06.964
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, they've tried that... Like, there was...

01:02:09.834 --> 01:02:38.773
[SPEAKER_06]: NFL game that they put out a while back well they had NFL Street and that's kind of been sore hit and miss and then they had some NFL game I think it was like All Pro or something like that that was the 2K one but they had another NFL game that was more arcadey a little bit like arena football almost and well they had an arena football game at one time even but yeah they like to experiment with that type of stuff

01:02:40.737 --> 01:02:46.321
[SPEAKER_06]: And really, you know, what they should get on the bandwagon for is rugby games because this year is the year of rugby games.

01:02:46.722 --> 01:02:50.124
[SPEAKER_06]: And they did have a rugby game back in 06, but it's been a while.

01:02:51.365 --> 01:02:54.988
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, let's move on with some more information about Final Fantasy XIV.

01:02:55.008 --> 01:02:56.889
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we've been talking about it a little bit on the show.

01:02:57.369 --> 01:03:01.873
[SPEAKER_08]: There's going to be a lot of change coming to that game next year, and it's a little bit unprecedented.

01:03:01.893 --> 01:03:04.495
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we've never really had a MMO where...

01:03:04.835 --> 01:03:05.395
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:03:26.250 --> 01:03:37.003
[SPEAKER_08]: The quote from the interview I believe which was with VG247 said quote not just the Vita but also smartphones so that kind of access will be allowed.

01:03:37.384 --> 01:03:44.373
[SPEAKER_08]: That will open the door to things like applications that people can use to check their inventory or check the market and purchase things from the auctions.

01:03:44.833 --> 01:03:48.977
[SPEAKER_08]: So it kind of sounds like what WoW kind of already does, but maybe a little something extra.

01:03:49.017 --> 01:03:50.758
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, who knows what could come with this.

01:03:51.218 --> 01:04:02.988
[SPEAKER_08]: By the way, they are also still speaking with Microsoft about an Xbox 360 version, but they are focusing on a PlayStation 3 version right now, saying that basically they promised they were going to make a PlayStation 3 version.

01:04:03.028 --> 01:04:05.130
[SPEAKER_08]: They haven't kept it, and they need to fulfill it.

01:04:05.430 --> 01:04:10.755
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think at this point it's probably a good thing that they wait until 2.0 is done, until they launch it on the PlayStation 3.

01:04:11.235 --> 01:04:18.717
[SPEAKER_06]: And seriously, my God, Microsoft needs to get on the ball with allowing MMOs onto their service.

01:04:19.657 --> 01:04:24.458
[SPEAKER_08]: So it'll be interesting to see if that ends up actually happening.

01:04:24.498 --> 01:04:26.558
[SPEAKER_08]: Or maybe, who knows, for the next Xbox system.

01:04:26.858 --> 01:04:30.399
[SPEAKER_08]: Final Fantasy XI was one of the early, early titles for the Xbox 360.

01:04:30.739 --> 01:04:33.039
[SPEAKER_08]: So you never know, it might end up going onto the next console.

01:04:33.059 --> 01:04:36.000
[SPEAKER_05]: And that didn't need XP Gold, did it?

01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:40.182
[SPEAKER_08]: No, 11 is really unlike any other 360 game.

01:04:40.242 --> 01:04:42.943
[SPEAKER_08]: Because if you think about it, Play Online is a joint venture with Sony.

01:04:43.343 --> 01:04:44.564
[SPEAKER_08]: You've got a Sony game on a 360.

01:04:44.864 --> 01:04:45.844
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was their biller, right?

01:04:45.884 --> 01:04:46.745
[SPEAKER_05]: Or their membership thing.

01:04:46.805 --> 01:04:47.105
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

01:04:47.525 --> 01:04:49.346
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, 14 doesn't use that.

01:04:49.486 --> 01:04:50.427
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all kind of separate.

01:04:50.447 --> 01:04:54.688
[SPEAKER_08]: But Final Fantasy 11 is really unlike anything else on the 360.

01:04:55.409 --> 01:04:59.951
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think Microsoft really bent all the rules to get that game on their console.

01:04:59.991 --> 01:05:01.512
[SPEAKER_08]: Because, you know, it was early on.

01:05:01.552 --> 01:05:02.092
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a launch.

01:05:02.672 --> 01:05:05.633
[SPEAKER_08]: And I gotta say, because I did play XI back in the day, it was pretty awesome on the 360.

01:05:05.893 --> 01:05:09.153
[SPEAKER_08]: If you had the keyboard and everything for it, it was a great way to play the game.

01:05:10.514 --> 01:05:26.397
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was talking to you about this last night, but luckily for Final Fantasy XIV, it's a gorgeous enough game that if it takes them another year or two to get their shit together, considering how WoW is seven years old and is finally starting to show its age visually...

01:05:26.957 --> 01:05:33.080
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty enough a game that it will still be relevant by the time they fix it.

01:05:34.061 --> 01:05:34.221
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

01:05:34.721 --> 01:05:44.447
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I mean, the other thing with the whole PlayStation 3 launch of 2.0 I wanted to kind of reiterate is that remember when Final Fantasy XI came out, in America we got version 2.0 of the game.

01:05:44.607 --> 01:05:49.569
[SPEAKER_08]: It was the launch of the game to us because the Rise of the Zillow expansion was included when that game launched here.

01:05:49.970 --> 01:05:53.452
[SPEAKER_08]: So we never saw the earliest version of that game, which also I guess was kind of buggy.

01:05:53.752 --> 01:05:53.972
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

01:05:54.352 --> 01:05:54.692
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

01:05:55.053 --> 01:05:59.875
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be interesting to see what happens, but don't expect me to pay for the game for a year to find out.

01:06:00.796 --> 01:06:01.736
[SPEAKER_08]: That's my big thing.

01:06:02.577 --> 01:06:03.057
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll see.

01:06:04.718 --> 01:06:10.762
[SPEAKER_08]: Speaking of MMOs, we get another question in our chat room from... Did I get away?

01:06:11.182 --> 01:06:11.902
[SPEAKER_08]: ZHEB?

01:06:12.703 --> 01:06:16.025
[SPEAKER_08]: ZHE... I can't pronounce this.

01:06:16.485 --> 01:06:17.626
[SPEAKER_08]: ZHSB, I think it is.

01:06:17.666 --> 01:06:17.846
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

01:06:18.567 --> 01:06:25.657
[SPEAKER_08]: ZHSB in chat says, Do you think Guild Wars 2 will end up being higher quality than WoW?

01:06:26.098 --> 01:06:29.823
[SPEAKER_08]: I know it won't be a WoW killer, but I'm still curious to see what you think.

01:06:30.024 --> 01:06:33.268
[SPEAKER_08]: Guild Wars' strength will always be its model.

01:06:33.789 --> 01:06:58.542
[SPEAKER_08]: and the fact that once you buy the game there is no monthly fee and that is so alluring to a lot of people that don't want to play WoW you know because of that whole thing and that's what makes Final Fantasy 14 good right now is that it's the same model essentially because they're not charging for monthly fee uh Guild Wars 2 looks great but I can't tell you anything else until I can really get my hands on it it's one thing to see the demos on YouTube and I gotta say it looks sexy as hell the graphics look great I'm really excited

01:06:59.282 --> 01:07:25.314
[SPEAKER_08]: but again, I gotta get my hands on it until I can really tell you if it's gonna be worth it or not so next year, we'll see alright, let's move on more stories Salacious Pop so of course we all remember back in April when it was the week that Portal 2 and Mortal Kombat came out that PlayStation Network was hacked and everyone was very sad and it was very end of the world

01:07:26.634 --> 01:07:39.063
[SPEAKER_05]: And as a result, when all these gaming journalism sites were like, well, how can you avoid having your credit card saved to these servers if they're going to get compromised so often?

01:07:39.183 --> 01:07:42.745
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of the solutions was to buy game codes.

01:07:43.606 --> 01:07:50.971
[SPEAKER_05]: I know if you go into GameStop, you'll see a whole wall of basically these... They kind of look like gift cards at the supermarket where you're just buying...

01:07:52.532 --> 01:07:56.034
[SPEAKER_05]: The code, you're paying, obviously, the retailer for that.

01:07:56.074 --> 01:08:04.097
[SPEAKER_05]: You take the code, you load it into your PS3, and you're downloading the game directly without having to put a credit card, put points into your PSN bucket and all that stuff.

01:08:05.318 --> 01:08:09.219
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the ways to get these codes was through Amazon.

01:08:09.580 --> 01:08:11.801
[SPEAKER_05]: You could buy these cards through Amazon directly.

01:08:12.541 --> 01:08:14.302
[SPEAKER_05]: Or I think maybe they just emailed the code to you.

01:08:14.742 --> 01:08:17.803
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was a way to get around Sony's shopping cart.

01:08:18.023 --> 01:08:21.665
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you're worried about having your credit card information stolen,

01:08:22.085 --> 01:08:27.208
[SPEAKER_05]: because Amazon, I think, is a more reputable retailer.

01:08:27.468 --> 01:08:32.031
[SPEAKER_05]: Those PSN stores, primarily the ones on Amazon, all that content has been removed.

01:08:32.591 --> 01:08:33.611
[SPEAKER_05]: You cannot do that anymore.

01:08:34.352 --> 01:08:37.854
[SPEAKER_05]: So for all the people that were using Amazon to get around PSN,

01:08:38.374 --> 01:08:40.658
[SPEAKER_08]: Which was a lot more people after the hacks, I'm sure.

01:08:40.758 --> 01:08:40.998
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

01:08:41.599 --> 01:08:43.001
[SPEAKER_05]: After that whole end of the world thing.

01:08:43.021 --> 01:08:47.267
[SPEAKER_05]: And we still haven't heard, I don't think, about anybody really getting screwed over.

01:08:47.467 --> 01:08:48.509
[SPEAKER_05]: Meanwhile on Xbox.

01:08:48.529 --> 01:08:49.530
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, meanwhile on Xbox Live.

01:08:49.571 --> 01:08:51.854
[SPEAKER_08]: Another friend of mine, by the way, got hacked this week.

01:08:52.094 --> 01:08:52.675
[SPEAKER_08]: Another friend of mine.

01:08:52.915 --> 01:08:53.276
[SPEAKER_08]: Just saying.

01:08:55.504 --> 01:09:03.828
[SPEAKER_05]: So Amazon has confirmed the removal of the content, and they have no announcements regarding this change in selection, so they're being kind of hush-hush about it.

01:09:04.849 --> 01:09:06.850
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe Sony has been nudged.

01:09:06.930 --> 01:09:09.091
[SPEAKER_05]: They're PR saying, what's up with Amazon?

01:09:09.131 --> 01:09:11.793
[SPEAKER_05]: Why'd they drop your stuff?

01:09:12.153 --> 01:09:13.393
[SPEAKER_05]: Sony hasn't responded yet.

01:09:14.514 --> 01:09:19.878
[SPEAKER_06]: I doubt that has anything to do with it, but more of that they want more control over that stuff.

01:09:38.433 --> 01:09:42.175
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I'm kind of curious as to what's going on there.

01:09:42.255 --> 01:09:45.717
[SPEAKER_08]: But maybe it's just they just, for whatever reason, don't want to do it.

01:09:45.797 --> 01:09:49.319
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe they just want to try to get more people to tie their credit cards on PSN.

01:09:49.499 --> 01:09:49.899
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

01:09:49.919 --> 01:09:50.299
[SPEAKER_05]: Who knows?

01:09:50.539 --> 01:09:52.140
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

01:09:52.320 --> 01:09:54.141
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't really know if it was Amazon's decision.

01:09:54.301 --> 01:09:56.162
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe because they just didn't sell well.

01:09:56.202 --> 01:10:00.665
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe people just buy those game codes at a retailer, like a brick-and-mortar one.

01:10:01.065 --> 01:10:03.226
[SPEAKER_08]: Or maybe Sony's got something competing coming up.

01:10:03.486 --> 01:10:03.826
[SPEAKER_08]: Who knows?

01:10:04.827 --> 01:10:05.007
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

01:10:05.575 --> 01:10:06.155
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

[SPEAKER_06]: Kirby's Return to Dreamland for Nintendo Wii, Dragon Ball Z Ultimate Tenkaichi on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, Stronghold 3 on PC, and you can actually catapult cows in that game.

01:10:37.695 --> 01:10:38.516
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty awesome.

01:10:39.516 --> 01:10:43.957
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, Motion Explosion for Xbox 360, another generic party game.

01:10:44.917 --> 01:10:48.978
[SPEAKER_06]: Just Dance Kids 2 on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii.

01:10:49.158 --> 01:10:50.359
[SPEAKER_06]: Ew, is that like Kidz Bop?

01:10:51.139 --> 01:10:56.040
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it used to be like, kind of like the wheels on the bus go round and round and that kind of bullshit.

01:10:56.340 --> 01:10:59.641
[SPEAKER_06]: But, um, actually it's not so much that now.

01:10:59.661 --> 01:11:00.701
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, they do have...

01:11:01.361 --> 01:11:06.203
[SPEAKER_06]: Some songs on there, I'm not really sure if I recognize them.

01:11:06.243 --> 01:11:09.164
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it just family safe stuff, like old disco songs?

01:11:09.564 --> 01:11:10.705
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, like some of that.

01:11:11.145 --> 01:11:12.625
[SPEAKER_08]: Ooh, pop your pussy, girl.

01:11:13.846 --> 01:11:14.906
[SPEAKER_08]: Like that kind of music.

01:11:14.926 --> 01:11:15.887
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, nothing like that.

01:11:16.287 --> 01:11:18.247
[SPEAKER_06]: No, they had some songs listed on here.

[SPEAKER_08]: Will Smith's kid?

[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, no, I don't know his song.

01:11:34.822 --> 01:11:35.143
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

01:11:35.703 --> 01:11:36.584
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, it's not his song.

01:11:36.644 --> 01:11:37.365
[SPEAKER_08]: It's his kid's song.

01:11:37.885 --> 01:11:38.766
[SPEAKER_06]: I whip my hair back and forth.

01:11:38.786 --> 01:11:40.167
[SPEAKER_08]: You've never heard that song.

01:11:40.507 --> 01:11:42.989
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I have not heard that song, and I don't wish to hear that song.

01:11:43.009 --> 01:11:44.490
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you live in a cave or something?

01:11:44.731 --> 01:11:46.652
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't listen to fucking radio, okay?

01:11:47.213 --> 01:11:50.795
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, it's not one of the ten songs that they play on Top 40 stations.

01:11:50.855 --> 01:11:51.476
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I know.

01:11:51.796 --> 01:11:55.039
[SPEAKER_06]: Top 40, that means they play the same ten songs four times every hour.

01:11:57.472 --> 01:12:11.597
[SPEAKER_08]: you have to hear how amazing this song is and by amazing I mean amazingly terrible hold on I'm trying to bring it up in studio right now hold on let's see here if I can get it going props to him I mean I hope that he does just remember she's nine

[SPEAKER_00]: What the hell?

01:12:34.787 --> 01:12:38.689
[SPEAKER_06]: She obviously did not inherit her dad's musical talent.

01:12:38.709 --> 01:12:41.010
[SPEAKER_08]: She's nine, Loki!

01:12:41.090 --> 01:12:41.750

[SPEAKER_08]: Where, on Toddlers and Tiaras?

01:12:48.634 --> 01:12:51.455
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I can't think of where else to see nine-year-olds performing.

[SPEAKER_06]: It's basically a game for taking photos and editing photos or something like that.

01:13:47.455 --> 01:13:48.275

[SPEAKER_08]: Which is usually a bad sign.

01:15:54.616 --> 01:15:57.397

01:16:18.748 --> 01:16:21.870
[SPEAKER_08]: I was going to play the audio, but it's just some douchebag talking over the gameplay.

01:16:22.270 --> 01:16:23.851
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks neat.

01:16:24.111 --> 01:16:25.831
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks like LittleBigPlanet.

01:16:27.092 --> 01:16:30.853
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I remember somebody saying something about a LittleBigPlanet-ish Disney game.

01:16:30.973 --> 01:16:35.855
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they look like the LittleBigPlanet sack boys, but it's obviously not that.

[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it looks alright.

01:16:37.676 --> 01:16:38.236

[SPEAKER_06]: It is a lot of games, and it's only going to get bigger until it gets to December.

01:17:20.198 --> 01:17:21.279
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, Japan this week.

[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what this is.

01:17:31.167 --> 01:17:34.490
[SPEAKER_08]: Muv Love and Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine.

01:17:34.510 --> 01:17:35.711
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got to see what Muv Love is.

01:17:35.811 --> 01:17:36.351
[SPEAKER_05]: Muff Love?

01:17:36.411 --> 01:17:37.692
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to see the peripheral for that.

01:17:37.732 --> 01:17:39.414
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's not Muff Love.

01:17:39.434 --> 01:17:40.255
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's an anime.

01:17:40.275 --> 01:17:41.916
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's based off an anime.

01:17:43.514 --> 01:17:44.875
[SPEAKER_08]: That is an awesome name for a game

01:18:01.161 --> 01:18:01.962
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't push your luck.

01:18:02.242 --> 01:18:07.185
[SPEAKER_08]: Just because we're getting bungee ferret tossing, don't push your luck on big titty cyberbots.

01:18:09.046 --> 01:18:13.189

[SPEAKER_08]: That is finally out on the PSP this week.

01:19:09.865 --> 01:19:12.866
[SPEAKER_08]: Ragnarok, Hikari, Toyami, No Kujo.

01:19:13.506 --> 01:19:17.287
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I believe this is another Ragnarok Online-based game.

01:19:17.307 --> 01:19:18.207
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what it looks like to me.

01:19:18.587 --> 01:19:21.028
[SPEAKER_08]: So, DarkSakura, sadly not here to squee.

01:19:21.768 --> 01:19:23.689
[SPEAKER_08]: SalaciousPop, are you going to squee on behalf of DarkSakura?

01:19:23.709 --> 01:19:23.869
[SPEAKER_08]: Eee!

01:19:24.890 --> 01:19:25.290

[SPEAKER_08]: Woo Alright And there's a whole bunch of other stuff listed under Generically October 2011 And I'm not going to read off all that stuff Yeah, there's a lot Alright, let's move on Just a couple more stories for you guys And then the classic game of the week Yes, DarkSakura has given her blessing That we could do a game this week without her And we've got a good one tonight Meanwhile, a couple quick news stories Loki Hey, remember a few months back Several months back

01:21:35.267 --> 01:21:36.769
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:21:51.190 --> 01:21:53.492
[SPEAKER_06]: There is a new jailbreak that's out now.

01:21:53.632 --> 01:22:03.562
[SPEAKER_06]: It apparently is for the firmware version 3.55 consoles and supports games up to the current firmware 3.73.

01:22:04.143 --> 01:22:06.185
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're able to patch the games and play them on those consoles.

01:22:06.625 --> 01:22:22.273
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently the dongle will allow you to play titles burned to Blu-ray discs via hard drive, including FIFA 12, Driver San Francisco, God of War Origins Collection, Pro Evo 2012, X-Men Destiny, and Sniper Ghost Warrior.

01:22:23.054 --> 01:22:25.815
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's circulating in Indonesia right now.

01:22:25.855 --> 01:22:27.516
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be sold for roughly $45.

01:22:30.117 --> 01:22:31.938
[SPEAKER_06]: And they have a little video showing it.

01:22:31.958 --> 01:22:35.100
[SPEAKER_06]: It kind of boots up to a developer screen and stuff like that.

01:22:35.720 --> 01:22:38.204
[SPEAKER_06]: So obviously, what's that mean for everybody else?

01:22:38.344 --> 01:22:44.332
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it means a lot more patches and a lot more firmware updates, of course, as they try to block this thing.

01:22:44.412 --> 01:22:46.895
[SPEAKER_06]: So look forward to that.

01:22:47.115 --> 01:22:48.958
[SPEAKER_06]: And hopefully the network doesn't go down again.

01:22:52.241 --> 01:23:15.793
[SPEAKER_05]: like I've said before I think crypto hackers that are really into DRM and stuff they may not even care about games that much they just love the challenge of breaking really good crypto and then they put it out and make money off of it so you know who knows but it's just gonna you know it's like plugging your thumb into a dam with all these holes in it trying to keep the water out you can only do it for so long

01:23:18.985 --> 01:23:19.365
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

01:23:20.105 --> 01:23:22.246
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, moving on to another story for you guys.

01:23:22.286 --> 01:23:23.326
[SPEAKER_08]: This is actually a pretty big one.

01:23:23.346 --> 01:23:25.967
[SPEAKER_08]: Nintendo had a press conference in the middle of the night.

01:23:26.047 --> 01:23:33.668
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, okay, it was day during Japan, but it was the middle of the night for us about the 3DS and just detailing a ton and ton of new updates coming for the 3DS.

01:23:34.229 --> 01:23:37.789
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all around one big firmware update coming this November.

01:23:38.129 --> 01:23:40.130
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think we had a specific date on this, right?

01:23:40.690 --> 01:23:41.790
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course not, so they can delay it.

01:23:42.070 --> 01:23:44.951
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, so it can be the very last day of November and it'd still be on time.

01:23:45.591 --> 01:23:46.832
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of the features that are going to be in this.

01:23:47.452 --> 01:23:49.352
[SPEAKER_08]: 3D video recording, which they've said before.

01:23:49.872 --> 01:23:53.234
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going to be able to make clips up to 10 minutes long.

01:23:53.574 --> 01:23:57.415
[SPEAKER_08]: What also is part of this, which I gotta admit is kind of cool, stop motion animation.

01:23:57.835 --> 01:23:58.935
[SPEAKER_08]: Part of the 3D videos.

01:23:59.215 --> 01:23:59.656
[SPEAKER_08]: That's neat.

01:24:01.116 --> 01:24:04.617
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's easy, but you know people are going to get creative with this.

01:24:04.697 --> 01:24:05.177
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll be fun.

01:24:06.338 --> 01:24:10.679
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a neat idea, but the cameras are just really terrible.

01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:31.010
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's alright, they'll fix that in the next version of the 3DS There will be a map overlay to show where Miis you got in StreetPass are from Does that mean you'll literally be able to see I got 100 people Well Rob, it'll be nice to know where you live Well yeah, but when you specify where you live on the 3DS They don't have GPS in them, you just say California

01:24:31.790 --> 01:24:42.623
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it'll be interesting, because I get a lot of street passes at Disneyland when I go, and I get a lot of people from Mexico, and I get a lot of people, of course, in California, but I get all around the U.S., because, of course, Disneyland is a place for everybody around the world.

01:24:42.983 --> 01:24:49.631
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a shit ton of memes from Japan, thanks to that day we were at E3, and I street passed, like, 50 people in, like, five minutes.

01:24:50.232 --> 01:24:50.952
[SPEAKER_08]: So, eh.

01:24:51.973 --> 01:25:06.560
[SPEAKER_08]: you will be able to transfer software to other 3DS systems which is good because if the inevitable Game Boy Advance games come out and then you've got the inevitable 3DS upgrade that will happen next year so of course you're going to get suckered into buying the new 3DS you won't lose any of the shit you got on the current DS

01:25:06.946 --> 01:25:07.487
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:25:23.557 --> 01:25:31.663
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got a shitload of people on that from your trips to Disneyland, and you still only have... No, I've beat Find Me once, and I'm on the second go-through right now.

01:25:31.683 --> 01:25:32.904
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm about halfway through go-through number two.

01:25:32.924 --> 01:25:33.584
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you get more hats?

01:25:34.085 --> 01:25:34.765
[SPEAKER_08]: You do, actually.

01:25:35.145 --> 01:25:38.448
[SPEAKER_05]: You've encountered people with these awesome-looking Metroid hats and all this stuff.

01:25:38.468 --> 01:25:40.629
[SPEAKER_05]: They must have beat the game several times to get that.

01:25:40.689 --> 01:25:42.851
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I have the Metroid hat and I have the crown.

01:25:42.991 --> 01:25:46.393
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't have that demon hat that is changed color.

01:25:46.413 --> 01:25:47.414
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's what you get...

01:25:47.694 --> 01:25:52.456
[SPEAKER_08]: Time 2, because that's the last boss in Find Me, so I'm thinking it's what you get on the second playthrough when you beat it.

01:25:53.216 --> 01:25:57.918
[SPEAKER_08]: And I am one puzzle piece away from having every single puzzle piece in the puzzle exchange game.

01:25:58.738 --> 01:26:00.418
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I'll have that soon too.

01:26:02.319 --> 01:26:06.320
[SPEAKER_06]: Does finding every puzzle piece make your 3DS spawn another analog stick?

01:26:07.401 --> 01:26:08.081
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't think so.

01:26:08.201 --> 01:26:10.422
[SPEAKER_08]: You just get pretty 3D pictures to rotate around.

01:26:10.842 --> 01:26:13.263
[SPEAKER_08]: And the one last one I need is those stupid Pikmin.

01:26:15.724 --> 01:26:19.486
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, I guess there's supposed to be another new StreetPass game that's not just Find Me.

01:26:19.867 --> 01:26:22.208
[SPEAKER_08]: So I guess they're adding more for the StreetPass stuff, which is cool.

01:26:22.949 --> 01:26:25.650
[SPEAKER_08]: A few more details on Mario Kart 7 came out.

01:26:26.311 --> 01:26:30.353
[SPEAKER_08]: You will be able to do a player online at 60 frames a second.

01:26:30.393 --> 01:26:31.734
[SPEAKER_08]: That's pretty impressive if true.

01:26:32.174 --> 01:26:32.875
[SPEAKER_08]: So that'll be cool.

01:26:32.915 --> 01:26:34.996
[SPEAKER_08]: You can do online or offline racing.

01:26:35.436 --> 01:26:41.200
[SPEAKER_08]: You will be able to set up communities so you can have groups of people to race against and have criteria for these communities.

01:26:41.260 --> 01:26:41.780
[SPEAKER_08]: That's kind of cool.

01:26:42.060 --> 01:26:45.663
[SPEAKER_08]: If there's an OLR community way to do that, we will build one, absolutely.

01:26:46.965 --> 01:26:53.711
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going to be able to get data from other people by using StreetPass, which will be win-loss records, coin data, and ghost data.

01:26:53.811 --> 01:26:55.673
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's kind of cool because that's in Ridge Racer right now.

01:26:55.693 --> 01:26:57.835
[SPEAKER_08]: So that would be cool to have that in Mario Kart.

01:26:58.217 --> 01:27:01.501
[SPEAKER_08]: Also announced, Lakitu and Metal Mario as characters.

01:27:01.561 --> 01:27:03.003
[SPEAKER_08]: They're really stretching now, aren't they?

01:27:04.364 --> 01:27:07.508
[SPEAKER_08]: Hulu Plus will be coming to the 3DS and the Wii.

01:27:07.768 --> 01:27:12.974
[SPEAKER_06]: Mario Kart, you know, you can put characters from your other franchises in there.

01:27:12.994 --> 01:27:16.638
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you don't just have to do Mario and Donkey Kong.

01:27:17.199 --> 01:27:18.660
[SPEAKER_06]: Donkey Kong's not part of... I mean...

01:27:19.441 --> 01:27:26.826
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I know he was in the first Donkey Kong game, but the new Donkey Kong Country crap is not part of the Mario series.

01:27:27.106 --> 01:27:28.407
[SPEAKER_06]: It's its own thing.

01:27:28.587 --> 01:27:34.791
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can put Zelda and Samus and stuff like that.

01:27:35.211 --> 01:27:37.533
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot more characters to use other than Metal Mario.

01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:39.340
[SPEAKER_08]: That's true.

01:27:39.400 --> 01:27:41.001
[SPEAKER_08]: They could be put... Yeah, they could cross over.

01:27:41.081 --> 01:27:42.762
[SPEAKER_08]: Or just Pac-Man and Ms.

01:27:42.802 --> 01:27:44.102
[SPEAKER_08]: Pac-Man are in the arcade one.

01:27:44.122 --> 01:27:47.104
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I know the arcade one's made by Namco, but still, you've got that agreement.

01:27:47.904 --> 01:27:50.225
[SPEAKER_06]: Although... Or, you know, some of the Smash Bros.

01:27:50.265 --> 01:27:54.507
[SPEAKER_06]: characters, like, you know, some of the F-Zero characters... Kid Icarus and his car can fly.

01:27:55.707 --> 01:27:56.247
[SPEAKER_08]: Hulu Plus Hulu Plus

01:28:20.894 --> 01:28:24.297
[SPEAKER_08]: If, hypothetically, if we were paying for Hulu Plus, would you be down with that?

01:28:24.897 --> 01:28:29.221
[SPEAKER_05]: The Netflix client on the 3DS, in my opinion, is really bad and laggy and awful.

01:28:29.741 --> 01:28:32.324
[SPEAKER_05]: And it times out all the time and it's not wireless.

01:28:32.604 --> 01:28:36.367
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would need the Hulu Plus client to be better than that.

01:28:36.707 --> 01:28:37.027
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.

01:28:37.047 --> 01:28:38.348
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't even realize it was that crappy.

01:28:38.708 --> 01:28:43.071
[SPEAKER_08]: What's important to note, though, is that while you might go, meh, or LOL, they're still supporting the Wii.

01:28:43.591 --> 01:28:49.014
[SPEAKER_08]: Netflix, the Wii is the number one for Netflix, which surprised the hell out of me, but they're in enough homes where, yeah.

01:28:49.074 --> 01:28:51.015
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, look at the sales data of how many Wiis were sold.

01:28:51.035 --> 01:28:52.356
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not that much of a stretch.

01:28:52.476 --> 01:28:54.217
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's going to be big for them to get Hulu Plus.

01:28:55.178 --> 01:29:03.385
[SPEAKER_08]: I think this is kind of neat more so than almost anything else is that the 3DS is going to be getting a messaging system called Nintendo Letterbox.

01:29:03.886 --> 01:29:07.729
[SPEAKER_08]: You will be able to send notes and photos and sounds to friends.

01:29:08.029 --> 01:29:15.056
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean granted you can kind of do this with what's called a cell phone with SMS and so forth but it opens it up to younger folks if

01:29:15.556 --> 01:29:45.045
[SPEAKER_08]: they had it on the Wii where you can send messages and photos but your Wii didn't really have a camera built in so like I could take 3D pictures of Disneyland and send it to my friends and make them jealous that'll be kind of cool so I don't know I think it's neat I'm not like oh my god it's the most amazing technology ever to happen but it seems like one of those things where it's like wow Nintendo's finally starting to like catch up with online and starting to implement features that we were seeing in other systems like five years ago but at least it's forward movement good job

01:29:47.475 --> 01:30:16.334
[SPEAKER_08]: so lots of stuff coming out for the 3DS in November maybe even sooner for some of this other stuff so we'll see alright meanwhile it is time to open up the gaming vault and take a trip in and find a classic video game of the week now DarkSakura is not here tonight but she left a key to her house and she left the vault unlocked so we made SalaciousPop go into the vault and find a game that he thinks you should be playing this week so that we wouldn't get in trouble

01:30:17.202 --> 01:30:22.267
[SPEAKER_08]: SalaciousPop, what did you find in DarkSakura's vault that is worthy of being the classic game of the week?

01:30:22.507 --> 01:30:30.294
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the first and one of the best Zelda, original Legend of Zelda clones for the NES, a little SNK RPG known as Crystallis.

01:30:31.355 --> 01:30:31.835
[SPEAKER_05]: Good pick.

01:30:31.976 --> 01:30:32.616
[SPEAKER_08]: Very good pick.

01:30:33.017 --> 01:30:34.298
[SPEAKER_08]: I was really surprised, DarkSakura.

01:30:34.318 --> 01:30:37.661
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd never done this one because this seems like one of those things that's obvious to me.

01:30:40.183 --> 01:30:46.668
[SPEAKER_05]: Crystallis was released in Japan April 13th of 1990 and came out in the U.S.

01:30:46.808 --> 01:30:51.851
[SPEAKER_05]: translated for the NES three months later in July of 90.

01:30:53.192 --> 01:31:02.619
[SPEAKER_05]: It was praised for the original 8-bit NES, relatively advanced graphics, very beautiful game, and also its fantastic graphics.

01:31:02.759 --> 01:31:03.299
[SPEAKER_05]: Soundtrack.

01:31:04.059 --> 01:31:10.002
[SPEAKER_05]: And I usually would just forget who actually made Crystalis.

01:31:10.042 --> 01:31:16.724
[SPEAKER_05]: I was thinking it was maybe one of Enix's first RPGs, but no, it was SNK as of a King of Fighters fame.

01:31:17.404 --> 01:31:25.807
[SPEAKER_05]: This is an RPG they put out, and I'm sure they've had titles in Japan that may not have made it over here, but I can't think of any other SNK RPGs.

01:31:27.338 --> 01:31:27.638
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you?

01:31:30.159 --> 01:31:30.859
[SPEAKER_08]: Not really.

01:31:30.979 --> 01:31:32.220
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I can't, actually.

01:31:32.620 --> 01:31:37.422
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, this is kind of just a weird sort of anomaly, but it was a fantastic game.

01:31:38.823 --> 01:31:47.526
[SPEAKER_05]: The title in Japan was God Slayer Haruka Tenku no Sonata, which is God Slayer Sonata of the Faraway Sky.

01:31:48.467 --> 01:31:49.767
[SPEAKER_05]: And the plot is that...

01:31:52.348 --> 01:31:58.575
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, humanity built this huge, powerful tower for whatever nefarious reason.

01:31:58.635 --> 01:32:08.144
[SPEAKER_05]: Technology got out of control, and once this tower was built up in the sky, there was some big apocalypse, and now the world is overrun with monsters.

01:32:09.746 --> 01:32:30.026
[SPEAKER_05]: you wake up in a very sort of futuristic sci-fi hibernation chamber where there's like a big glass door that slides open and you come out and you have amnesia and you don't know what's going on or who you are and you find sort of a little old RPG town and they're like you came out of that cave and

01:32:30.206 --> 01:32:31.127
[SPEAKER_05]: And oh my god.

01:32:31.527 --> 01:32:33.288
[SPEAKER_05]: So you have to figure out who you are.

01:32:34.009 --> 01:32:39.813
[SPEAKER_05]: And these four sages basically say that this evil dude is trying to get into the tower.

01:32:39.973 --> 01:32:46.337
[SPEAKER_05]: The Dragonia Empire is trying to get into the tower so they can go blow up the world again.

01:32:47.197 --> 01:32:50.540
[SPEAKER_05]: And you have to find these four swords, Earth, Fire, Wind, Water.

01:32:51.180 --> 01:32:53.962
[SPEAKER_05]: And you have to combine them to form Crystallis.

01:32:54.702 --> 01:32:59.185
[SPEAKER_05]: And then only then, once you have that legendary sword, you can then take out the evil dude.

01:33:00.426 --> 01:33:09.870
[SPEAKER_05]: Thinking that sounds kind of Zelda-ish, at least Link to the Past and so on, then you'd probably be right, that the plot lines are sort of similar.

01:33:11.390 --> 01:33:21.534
[SPEAKER_05]: The water sword you could use if you swung it, you could make little ice bridges over narrow little streams of water, so there were some puzzle-solving elements too on which sword you used.

01:33:22.234 --> 01:33:33.679
[SPEAKER_05]: You also had XP, so you would gain levels and your stats would go up and it was possible if you wanted to to grind and min-max your way all the way up to level 99 stats with everything.

01:33:37.456 --> 01:33:48.764
[SPEAKER_05]: It had some kind of janky collision detection, where you would try to avoid a monster and you would still hit it anyway, or trying to navigate some of the lava and the paths were kind of weird.

01:33:48.904 --> 01:33:56.590
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that it suffered from... You know like in Mega Man games when there were too many sprites, it would get kind of stuttery?

01:33:57.831 --> 01:33:58.992
[SPEAKER_05]: Crystallis had a lot of that.

01:33:59.432 --> 01:34:02.394
[SPEAKER_05]: But otherwise it was a very solid action RPG that was...

01:34:04.096 --> 01:34:05.897
[SPEAKER_05]: Final Fantasy Legend of Zelda Legend of Zelda

01:34:19.691 --> 01:34:27.995
[SPEAKER_05]: Ken Su and Athena from the magical girl pop star from King of Fighters and Sai Ken Su.

01:34:29.175 --> 01:34:32.016
[SPEAKER_05]: Two of the elders are analogs of them.

01:34:32.257 --> 01:34:37.539
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was kind of some meta fan service even back then in 1990 that they had done for their previous franchise.

01:34:37.559 --> 01:34:41.020
[SPEAKER_05]: And I believe this is before King of Fighters was a thing.

01:34:41.321 --> 01:34:41.020
1990.

01:34:41.741 --> 01:34:43.281
[SPEAKER_05]: Fatal Fury, I believe, was out by then.

01:34:44.162 --> 01:34:48.144
[SPEAKER_05]: And the Athena, the platformer with Sai and Athena in it.

01:34:48.184 --> 01:34:48.364
[SPEAKER_05]: But...

01:34:49.244 --> 01:34:51.006
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to say, wasn't that also an NES game?

01:34:51.046 --> 01:34:52.287
[SPEAKER_05]: Like way, way, way early on?

01:34:52.407 --> 01:35:02.777
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so those characters were already established and they did fan service-y things with Kensou and Athena and Crystallis Yeah, I remember seeing that in Crystallis and I was like, is that tied to the other game?

01:35:02.817 --> 01:35:04.078
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, kind of funny

01:35:04.338 --> 01:35:30.188
[SPEAKER_05]: and there's a female character who you find who seems to have all of her memories and you can tell by looking at her character model or her sprite that she's obviously from the same time as you and she was hibernated in the past and awoke in the future just like you were and she kind of plays a role like Sheik in Ocarina of Time where she sort of shows up and gives some expositive narrative and helps you and then disappears again.

01:35:31.148 --> 01:35:37.770
[SPEAKER_05]: and it turns out that both you and her are scientists that willfully froze yourself so that you could reawaken.

01:35:38.070 --> 01:35:38.610
[SPEAKER_05]: Spoiler!

01:35:38.870 --> 01:35:39.170
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

01:35:39.570 --> 01:35:41.051
[SPEAKER_05]: And help save the world.

01:35:42.811 --> 01:35:43.772
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a kick-ass game.

01:35:43.912 --> 01:35:44.952
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a great game.

01:35:45.352 --> 01:35:48.493
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, graphical problems aside, it was just so good.

01:35:48.853 --> 01:35:56.075
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember it used to make my friend really sad because his birthday was October 1st and when you boot up this game it goes October 1st, 1997, the end day.

01:35:56.595 --> 01:35:57.575
[SPEAKER_05]: That's my birthday!

01:35:58.856 --> 01:35:59.516
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome.

01:36:00.516 --> 01:36:01.617
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, I remember that.

01:36:01.637 --> 01:36:05.758
[SPEAKER_05]: It had that little in-game or cinematic thing.

01:36:05.778 --> 01:36:06.579
[SPEAKER_08]: Which we survived.

01:36:06.799 --> 01:36:08.640
[SPEAKER_08]: We got past the end day and then some.

01:36:10.060 --> 01:36:23.806
[SPEAKER_05]: And there are a lot of similarities with the plot and the overall styling and art direction of the game that makes people think that it was influenced in part by Miyazaki's Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind.

01:36:24.727 --> 01:36:27.208
[SPEAKER_05]: The floating tower and a lot of the themes are similar.

01:36:30.436 --> 01:36:42.843
[SPEAKER_05]: and the first village that you find when you wake up from the cave is called Leaf, which I believe there is a village in Nausicaa that was named the same thing.

01:36:44.123 --> 01:36:46.065
[SPEAKER_08]: Or it could just be that Leaf is kind of a common term.

01:36:49.346 --> 01:36:53.208
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the bosses, I don't know if this is a glitch, but basically...

01:36:54.509 --> 01:37:00.476
[SPEAKER_05]: If you just spammed the shit out of your sword attack button, you could kind of kill bosses by just, you know, button mashing.

01:37:01.717 --> 01:37:13.711
[SPEAKER_05]: I see here that a lot of people had problems with that when there was supposed to be some sort of more styled way on what weapons you use on a boss, but you kind of could ignore that and just find its weak spot and beat the hell out of it.

01:37:13.991 --> 01:37:14.732
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:37:32.210 --> 01:37:34.351
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, we are going to take a break, guys, but don't go anywhere.

01:37:34.371 --> 01:37:46.959
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to come back with plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio, including some rapid-fire news, some early talk about Xbox and next Xbox and PlayStation 4, and can you believe we haven't brought this game up yet tonight?

01:37:46.999 --> 01:37:48.240
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all people have been talking about all week.

01:37:48.380 --> 01:37:50.881
[SPEAKER_08]: Arkham City, we've got to talk about some things with that.

01:37:51.181 --> 01:37:57.285
[SPEAKER_08]: The Mailbag, the FUs of the Week, the Twitter topics, and your calls when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:38:03.357 --> 01:38:05.940
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:38:05.980 --> 01:38:11.926
[SPEAKER_08]: We are live tonight with the 433rd episode of our show for this October the 23rd of 2011.

01:38:13.588 --> 01:38:18.393
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura not here tonight sadly but taking her place and doing a mighty fine job so far.

01:38:18.533 --> 01:38:22.678
[SPEAKER_08]: Salacious Pop with a good classic game of the week by the way.

01:38:22.798 --> 01:38:23.298
[SPEAKER_08]: Very good job.

01:38:23.459 --> 01:38:23.759
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

01:38:24.179 --> 01:38:29.201
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the games that came up in the last segment that I was reading a little more about during the break, because I was just curious about this, Disney Universe.

01:38:30.081 --> 01:38:33.342
[SPEAKER_08]: It really does look like it's going to be just like LittleBigPlanet.

01:38:33.442 --> 01:38:34.983
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't even try to hide it.

01:38:35.363 --> 01:38:40.705
[SPEAKER_08]: But they say, I'm looking up the wiki on it, and they're saying, well, it also kind of looks like the Lego games, I guess.

01:38:41.185 --> 01:38:45.527
[SPEAKER_08]: But you play through six different worlds to beat enemies, get power-ups, and coins.

01:38:46.087 --> 01:38:51.749
[SPEAKER_08]: And I guess you can put on costumes resembling characters from 40 classic and contemporary Disney and Pixar properties.

01:38:52.449 --> 01:38:54.831
[SPEAKER_08]: And of course, the first thing I said is, is there Tron?

01:38:55.011 --> 01:38:55.492
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there Tron?

01:38:55.532 --> 01:38:55.992
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there Tron?

01:38:56.032 --> 01:38:56.633
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there Tron?

01:38:56.853 --> 01:38:57.274
[SPEAKER_08]: There's Tron.

01:38:57.394 --> 01:38:59.235
[SPEAKER_08]: Tron Legacy is one of them.

01:38:59.476 --> 01:39:01.638
[SPEAKER_08]: Sadly, I don't think that's one of the worlds you'll get to fight in.

01:39:01.678 --> 01:39:02.979
[SPEAKER_08]: That would make me very sad.

01:39:03.379 --> 01:39:04.460
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe downloadable later.

01:39:04.700 --> 01:39:06.422
[SPEAKER_08]: But I love that there's like Wall-E and stuff too.

01:39:06.562 --> 01:39:06.862
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

01:39:06.882 --> 01:39:07.423
[SPEAKER_08]: I might, I might.

01:39:07.543 --> 01:39:08.604
[SPEAKER_08]: I might have to check this out.

01:39:09.144 --> 01:39:13.646
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm kind of a sucker for Disney stuff, and LittleBigPlanet obviously is a great game, so we'll see.

01:39:13.666 --> 01:39:15.947
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, this is probably a $60 game, huh?

01:39:15.967 --> 01:39:16.347
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

01:39:17.208 --> 01:39:17.328
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

01:39:17.628 --> 01:39:18.088
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, it's not?

01:39:18.528 --> 01:39:19.269
[SPEAKER_08]: I think like $50.

01:39:20.069 --> 01:39:20.770
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, well, gee.

01:39:21.030 --> 01:39:21.870
[SPEAKER_08]: Such a value.

01:39:22.350 --> 01:39:23.451
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a bargain basement.

01:39:24.111 --> 01:39:24.491
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, boy.

01:39:25.072 --> 01:39:33.556
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, let's go around and do some rapid-fire news, because, you know, sometimes there's a lot of news, and we don't have a lot of time to go too in-depth, but we want to just make sure we cover a few things here.

01:39:34.556 --> 01:39:37.998
[SPEAKER_06]: Sony's 3D display will be coming out November 13th.

01:39:38.038 --> 01:39:43.860
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, it's $499, and it comes with, you know, Motor Store Apocalypse.

01:39:44.861 --> 01:39:49.063
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, there was Resistance 3, unlike promised before, but, you know, whatever.

01:39:50.304 --> 01:39:55.987
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, of course, a pair of glasses and an HDMI cable that you'll need to use that with your PlayStation 3.

01:39:57.508 --> 01:40:03.252
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can also buy separate sets of glasses for $70 as well.

01:40:03.492 --> 01:40:06.054
[SPEAKER_06]: And there are games supporting it so far.

01:40:06.814 --> 01:40:15.300
[SPEAKER_06]: Motorstorm Apocalypse, Gran Turismo 5, Killzone 3, and Super Stardust HD all support the simul view right now at launch.

01:40:15.660 --> 01:40:21.882
[SPEAKER_06]: and I believe I saw that Ridge Racer is supposed to be getting 3D support as well.

01:40:21.922 --> 01:40:22.682
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's kind of neat.

01:40:23.143 --> 01:40:27.644
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that's a game that would probably benefit from it quite a bit.

01:40:27.944 --> 01:40:32.126
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course people have been begging and pleading Valve, when are you going to release some...

01:40:34.047 --> 01:40:40.412
[SPEAKER_06]: and stuff I can buy for Portal, like actual Portal turrets and cubes and whatnot.

01:40:40.872 --> 01:40:44.435
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you will be able to buy a Portal turret very soon.

01:40:45.096 --> 01:40:48.779
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be plush, which is fine.

01:40:49.019 --> 01:40:50.340
[SPEAKER_06]: That's close enough, I guess.

01:40:50.761 --> 01:40:57.887
[SPEAKER_06]: It does have a glowing red eye with a motion detector and will, of course, spout different phrases from the game.

01:40:58.987 --> 01:41:05.749
[SPEAKER_06]: and they will be going on sale mid-December on ThinkGeek is where you can purchase those.

01:41:06.509 --> 01:41:11.831
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, also to go along with that will be the official Portal Companion Cube.

01:41:11.851 --> 01:41:14.192
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought they already had a cuddly Companion Cube.

01:41:14.292 --> 01:41:18.693
[SPEAKER_06]: I think a lot of those have been like people made them on... Is that like an Etsy rip-off?

01:41:18.713 --> 01:41:19.053
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, no.

01:41:19.473 --> 01:41:24.435
[SPEAKER_05]: Weren't they the official... They were like dice for your rear-view mirror in your car.

01:41:24.495 --> 01:41:25.255
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, maybe it was that.

01:41:25.275 --> 01:41:26.095
[SPEAKER_05]: Companion Cube dice.

01:41:26.175 --> 01:41:45.210
[SPEAKER_06]: this one is uh it's not huge it's like six inches cubed obviously and um it'll be available uh via the NECA shop um in November please don't throw them in the fireplace I guess um that'll be yeah coming out so um

01:41:47.054 --> 01:41:47.814
[SPEAKER_06]: Neat, I guess.

01:41:48.175 --> 01:41:53.058
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I said, I preferred that the portal turret wasn't exactly a plush item.

01:41:53.118 --> 01:41:54.899
[SPEAKER_06]: It kind of looks stupid when it's plush.

01:41:56.019 --> 01:42:00.502
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd rather a plastic thing that I can shoot bullets out of.

01:42:02.683 --> 01:42:03.804
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

01:42:03.964 --> 01:42:16.394
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, of course, to go along with Portal, there's some discussion regarding the second DLC expansion, which will be coming early next year, or late next year, depending if it gets delayed.

01:42:17.234 --> 01:42:20.317
[SPEAKER_06]: And it will include an in-game editor.

01:42:20.417 --> 01:42:28.223
[SPEAKER_06]: You may remember they were talking about something before, saying, wouldn't it be kind of cool if we could create some sort of like, almost like a Photoshop for...

01:42:28.783 --> 01:42:34.509
[SPEAKER_06]: Portal level editing that you can very easily create your own levels.

01:42:34.529 --> 01:42:35.150
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to do that.

01:42:35.370 --> 01:42:45.081
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, they're going to allow some additional view, play, vote on various levels that are going to be included in this.

01:42:45.781 --> 01:42:49.405
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the things that they're going to be adding is the ability to actually play

01:42:50.206 --> 01:42:50.546
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

01:43:04.386 --> 01:43:05.546
[SPEAKER_06]: 360 doesn't have Steam.

01:43:06.267 --> 01:43:12.088
[SPEAKER_05]: Wasn't Valve supposed to have some big announcement after Portal 2 came out on what their next project is?

01:43:12.128 --> 01:43:14.309
[SPEAKER_05]: Because as I understand it, we don't really know.

01:43:14.449 --> 01:43:15.149
[SPEAKER_05]: Defense of the Agents.

01:43:15.189 --> 01:43:15.569
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't it Dota?

01:43:15.729 --> 01:43:16.229
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's right.

01:43:16.309 --> 01:43:16.669
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

01:43:17.489 --> 01:43:19.970
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I was thinking, what is their next big thing that they're working on?

01:43:19.990 --> 01:43:21.130
[SPEAKER_05]: It's certainly not Half-Life.

01:43:21.170 --> 01:43:22.171
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't get me started.

01:43:22.351 --> 01:43:24.991
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, because they've already, you've seen, there's clips of that on YouTube.

01:43:25.031 --> 01:43:28.412
[SPEAKER_08]: Like people are already playing it at, I guess, conventions or some type of thing.

01:43:28.992 --> 01:43:30.753
[SPEAKER_08]: But then after that, who knows?

01:43:33.148 --> 01:43:35.872
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, SalaciousPop, I don't think it'll be Half-Life 3, but we'll see.

01:43:35.892 --> 01:43:36.293
[SPEAKER_08]: You never know.

01:43:36.433 --> 01:43:36.854
[SPEAKER_08]: You never know.

01:43:37.595 --> 01:43:39.398
[SPEAKER_08]: Christmas may come early this year, SalaciousPop.

01:43:39.418 --> 01:43:39.978
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you been good?

01:43:42.941 --> 01:43:50.344
[SPEAKER_06]: I think if it's going to be anything, they're just going to update the whole source engine, just do something brand new, like Half-Life 3 engine or something.

01:43:50.744 --> 01:43:53.646
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what's probably taking it so long, is they're going to have to create a new engine for it.

01:43:54.766 --> 01:43:58.748
[SPEAKER_08]: KaiJudo in our chatroom at chat.orange.com says, I want portal PJs.

01:43:59.648 --> 01:44:03.069
[SPEAKER_08]: Would they be little companion cubes, or little blue and orange portals, or what?

01:44:03.810 --> 01:44:10.513
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw this girl that had these portal earrings I thought were really cute, where she had a blue portal on one ear and an orange one on the other, and a guy running through.

01:44:10.533 --> 01:44:11.253
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought it was cute.

01:44:12.454 --> 01:44:14.576
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of cute little nerdy things out there.

01:44:15.637 --> 01:44:21.103
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, moving on to some rumored, I guess holiday-related bundles coming to the PlayStation 3.

01:44:21.924 --> 01:44:24.467
[SPEAKER_08]: A Mayhem Edition Move Bundle.

01:44:25.243 --> 01:44:27.445
[SPEAKER_08]: Killzone 3, Resistance 3 Game of the Year Edition

01:44:42.999 --> 01:44:50.622
[SPEAKER_08]: as you remember I said I wouldn't buy it until the game of the year edition came out it's November is it cheaper?

01:44:50.762 --> 01:45:11.191
[SPEAKER_05]: it's the same price it's $59.99 but it has all the expansions and they're also doing a bundle that's going to have the move controller with it as well oh that's cool our last few trips to Target and Best Buy have been you going LittleBigPlanet 2 there it is and I don't know I don't think they're doing a game of the year so maybe I should pick it up this time you can just borrow mine

01:45:12.571 --> 01:45:13.152
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:45:30.370 --> 01:45:32.631
[SPEAKER_08]: If you have a Kinect, you probably already know what Dance Central is all about.

01:45:32.651 --> 01:45:36.972
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you want to check out the new engine, you can shake for free to Club Can't Handle Me.

01:45:37.092 --> 01:45:39.013
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the David Guetta song, right, with Florida.

01:45:39.533 --> 01:45:42.474
[SPEAKER_08]: And Bulletproof by LaRue.

01:45:43.974 --> 01:45:47.015
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, the rest of the songs for the game have been announced.

01:45:47.575 --> 01:45:50.056
[SPEAKER_08]: Among some of the highlights, or lowlights, if you will.

01:45:51.124 --> 01:46:07.400
[SPEAKER_08]: Justin Bieber with Somebody to Love, Lady Gaga with Bad Romance, Little Boots, Sean Kingston with Fire Burning, Tweet featuring Missy Elliott with Oops Oh My, a cover version of Toxic, and Willow with Whip My Hair.

01:46:14.591 --> 01:46:16.433
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:46:37.429 --> 01:46:41.531
[SPEAKER_08]: The website WhatTheyPlay.com has closed.

01:46:41.971 --> 01:46:47.353
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't know IGN owned it, but yeah, IGN owned WhatTheyPlay.com, and it is no more.

01:46:48.153 --> 01:46:50.714
[SPEAKER_08]: On the Facebook page, I guess it was announced.

01:46:50.834 --> 01:46:53.535
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, no, because they didn't really announce it since February, so whatever.

01:46:53.936 --> 01:46:57.897
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess a closure notice went up or whatever, and now it just redirects to IGN.com.

01:46:58.297 --> 01:46:59.218
[SPEAKER_08]: Why this is funny?

01:46:59.538 --> 01:47:04.860
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll have to go check the Orange Lounge Radio wiki, but one of our very first dream games we ever came up with

01:47:05.200 --> 01:47:05.761
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:47:26.984 --> 01:47:51.034
[SPEAKER_08]: two guys kissing more offensive than a severed head so somehow that led to this whole discussion about whattheyplay.com snap be it what it may I don't even know what episode that was in but I'm sure it's all on the wiki the folks that update our wiki at orangeloungeradio.wikia.com they do a fantastic job archiving some of the shows and jokes it's great Salacious Pop, what do you have for us?

01:47:52.478 --> 01:47:54.100
[SPEAKER_05]: Rock Band 3 is getting some new songs.

01:47:54.781 --> 01:48:00.589
[SPEAKER_05]: Mostly Rob Zombie and White Zombie, his project before he started putting stuff out under his own name.

01:48:01.390 --> 01:48:05.556
[SPEAKER_05]: They're gonna be available October 25th for about $2 a song.

01:48:05.776 --> 01:48:07.478
[SPEAKER_05]: There are four of them in this update.

01:48:08.940 --> 01:48:23.986
[SPEAKER_05]: For those that remember The Darkness, that kind of retro, glam metal, sort of kitschy gimmick band that was popular a little while ago with that song, I Believe in a Thing Called Love, and the guy who's in the spandex jumpsuit, that song is a lot of fun.

01:48:24.927 --> 01:48:27.248
[SPEAKER_05]: I could see, you know, people getting drunk and playing rock band to that.

01:48:28.008 --> 01:48:55.801
[SPEAKER_05]: for Rob Zombie Living Dead Girl and then under the white zombie name Thunderciss65 which I seem to remember was a pretty badass song and white zombies Supercharger Heaven and also Supercharger Heaven is often referred to as Devilman because that's what's in the chorus I was going to ask where more human than human is but I'm like almost positive that's already in the game yeah Rockman has a lot of songs so very cool

01:48:56.945 --> 01:49:12.014
[SPEAKER_05]: In peripheral news, if you remember that, I think it was from Famitsu Magazine a couple weeks or months ago, the caddy for the 3DS that you pop it into and it has an extra right side analog thumbie thing.

01:49:12.574 --> 01:49:18.298
[SPEAKER_05]: And people were like, well, does this mean that the 3DS is going to get a new version that doesn't have this as an add-on?

01:49:18.498 --> 01:49:20.119
[SPEAKER_08]: It was always going to get a new version.

01:49:20.419 --> 01:49:20.879
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah.

01:49:21.119 --> 01:49:22.360
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Nintendo after all.

01:49:22.944 --> 01:49:31.952
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was being bundled with Monster Hunter over in Japan, which is a huge, huge Capcom franchise over there.

01:49:32.052 --> 01:49:35.755
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it's nearly as popular over here, but we're getting it here in the US.

01:49:36.776 --> 01:49:42.481
[SPEAKER_05]: They're saying that it's early 2012, whether that's Q1 or Q2 is what Capcom is forecasting.

01:49:45.103 --> 01:49:51.205
[SPEAKER_05]: It will be available for the Resident Evil Revelations game which is due out February 7th of next year.

01:49:51.305 --> 01:49:53.285
[SPEAKER_05]: So obviously by February 7th we're going to get this thing.

01:49:53.845 --> 01:49:55.506
[SPEAKER_05]: Will a AAA battery be included?

01:49:55.746 --> 01:49:58.227
[SPEAKER_08]: Because that's what this thing runs off of apparently.

01:49:58.427 --> 01:50:00.147
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't know how to plug into your DS.

01:50:00.167 --> 01:50:03.588
[SPEAKER_05]: Well the battery life on the 3DS is already pretty bad.

01:50:03.789 --> 01:50:06.990
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially if you have something open and then you just close the clamshell for sleep mode.

01:50:08.130 --> 01:50:09.690
[SPEAKER_05]: Your DS will die within an hour.

01:50:10.311 --> 01:50:10.411
[SPEAKER_05]: Um

01:50:11.571 --> 01:50:29.585
[SPEAKER_05]: so my understanding is that for whether it be Resident Evil Revelations or Monster Hunter while it's nice to have this catty thing with the extra right thumb analog thing that is not mandatory so you can still play these games without the extra right side thing

01:50:31.626 --> 01:50:57.532
[SPEAKER_08]: and if you're thinking about getting a 3DS at this point you might want to wait because there's going to be I'm sure a redo next year that just has all this shit included unless you must play Mario Kart 7 or one of the other games that's coming out soon which I can't say I blame you I'm really excited about that Mario game to be honest so for those of us that were for the early adopters who thought that it was just a horrible nightmare and you were hallucinating no it's real it's real and we're getting it and that's what you get I'm kidding um

01:50:59.012 --> 01:51:10.335
[SPEAKER_05]: Finally, and I have maybe a little resentment that Rob gave me this story to report on, but Karaoke Revolution Glee Volume 3, it's the best show ever.

01:51:10.395 --> 01:51:12.596
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god, what's going to happen with Mercedes?

01:51:13.216 --> 01:51:16.477
[SPEAKER_05]: It's coming out on the Xbox 360 and Wii November 22nd.

01:51:19.558 --> 01:51:43.819
[SPEAKER_08]: haven't the ratings for that show really dipped though like people are kind of getting over it like I heard that other Fox show the Fox show with that that one girl who just looks surprised like she looks like a deer in the headlights all that what's her name Zoe Zoe Zoe Deschanel yes her her show is like beating Glee and it comes on like after it or something so like Glee is like it's it's fading fast it's one of those flash in the pan shows probably

01:51:44.315 --> 01:51:48.538
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and of course, Konami is putting this out, obviously, because it's Karaoke Revolution.

01:51:48.759 --> 01:52:00.388
[SPEAKER_05]: And the Glee merchandise, I think, now is... And all the licensing and the Glee brand and all the CDs and the shit that they put out is a bigger... Probably, it's a bigger brand than the actual series.

01:52:00.888 --> 01:52:03.650
[SPEAKER_05]: All the crap that they're slapping the franchise onto.

01:52:04.011 --> 01:52:06.152
[SPEAKER_08]: How many Sue Silvesters are you going to see this Halloween?

01:52:07.013 --> 01:52:07.914
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's how Sue...

01:52:08.634 --> 01:52:24.009
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to admit she was the only funny thing on that show as much of a cartoon as that character is it's like the only reason to watch it I could care less about white kids with problems it was all about Sue Sylvester to me

01:52:24.457 --> 01:52:27.019
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, Glee, Karaoke Revolution, whoop the shit.

01:52:27.460 --> 01:52:28.220
[SPEAKER_05]: That's my last story.

01:52:28.541 --> 01:52:28.941
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

01:52:29.522 --> 01:52:33.385
[SPEAKER_08]: And by the way, that's like the only way Karaoke Revolution lives on right now.

01:52:33.445 --> 01:52:43.955
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's the funniest thing out of all of it is that Karaoke Revolution... Remember when Harmonix co-did the first Karaoke Revolution game and it was like really this whole new thing?

01:52:44.375 --> 01:52:46.237
[SPEAKER_08]: This is what your series turned into.

01:52:47.238 --> 01:52:49.800
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't stop believing.

01:52:53.464 --> 01:52:56.466
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, let's travel around and get some more news.

01:52:56.546 --> 01:52:58.828
[SPEAKER_08]: We are also going to be coming up to the mailbag very soon.

01:52:58.868 --> 01:53:02.291
[SPEAKER_08]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us your emails.

01:53:02.831 --> 01:53:04.913
[SPEAKER_08]: And Twitter topics coming later as well.

01:53:04.933 --> 01:53:08.796
[SPEAKER_08]: It's your last chance to get those in at Twitter.com slash OLR.

01:53:08.896 --> 01:53:10.818
[SPEAKER_08]: So at OLR on Twitter.

01:53:11.438 --> 01:53:11.998
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, Loki.

01:53:13.572 --> 01:53:19.074
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, of course, everyone's always talking about what's going to be next for the Xbox and PlayStation.

01:53:19.614 --> 01:53:30.138
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, of course, the rumor is that the next Xbox system is going to be slated for 2013, and they're saying with Nintendo revealing its...

01:53:30.618 --> 01:53:38.022
[SPEAKER_06]: Wii U console at E3, you know, it's kind of pushed them to release their system faster.

01:53:38.122 --> 01:53:59.814
[SPEAKER_06]: And apparently the site, well, the site Develop is saying, there's sources saying that apparently they have a source from the processor chip manufacturers to middleware firms that they're expecting an E3 2013 reveal of the console, followed by a launch later in the year.

01:54:02.097 --> 01:54:03.620
[SPEAKER_06]: and it could be as far away as early 2014.

01:54:07.512 --> 01:54:09.993
[SPEAKER_06]: Which, that's almost a 10 year life cycle.

01:54:10.113 --> 01:54:12.454
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's like 8, 9 years.

01:54:12.614 --> 01:54:15.295
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I can't really get too fussy about 8 years.

01:54:15.355 --> 01:54:16.296
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a good run for me.

01:54:16.536 --> 01:54:21.618
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I mean, what, the PlayStation 1 was out in 2... Well, the PlayStation 1 was what, 96, 95?

01:54:21.738 --> 01:54:22.258
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think 95.

01:54:22.298 --> 01:54:23.599
[SPEAKER_08]: That was when Toshin did it.

01:54:23.619 --> 01:54:24.799
[SPEAKER_05]: And then PlayStation 2 was 2001.

01:54:24.839 --> 01:54:25.099
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was... 2000.

01:54:25.139 --> 01:54:25.239
[SPEAKER_05]: 2000, okay.

01:54:25.259 --> 01:54:25.780
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a 5 year.

01:54:25.880 --> 01:54:26.800
[SPEAKER_08]: And then to the PlayStation 2 was 2006.

01:54:26.860 --> 01:54:26.940
[SPEAKER_08]: Or...

01:54:36.204 --> 01:54:37.066
[SPEAKER_08]: God, I can't count.

01:54:37.106 --> 01:54:37.887
[SPEAKER_08]: PlayStation 3 was 2006.

01:54:38.948 --> 01:54:39.910
[SPEAKER_08]: So that was the sixth year.

01:54:40.331 --> 01:54:44.097
[SPEAKER_08]: So if this pushes, what, seven or eight, that's pretty good.

01:54:44.197 --> 01:54:48.724
[SPEAKER_05]: The hardware is finally plateauing to the point where you can have sustainable graphics for eight years.

01:54:48.744 --> 01:54:49.545
[SPEAKER_05]: That's great.

01:54:49.866 --> 01:54:50.907
[SPEAKER_08]: I would think, though, that the...

01:54:51.508 --> 01:54:52.388
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:55:16.018 --> 01:55:17.239
[SPEAKER_08]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

01:55:37.006 --> 01:56:02.721
[SPEAKER_06]: and it's not necessarily the end of the life cycle because they could still be considering doing their 10 year life cycle it can go it can co-exist there's still games coming out for the PS2 so it could co-exist with it for a few years after I wouldn't be surprised to be able to push over 10 years so that's interesting well that's the theory at least so I guess we'll have to wait and see only a couple years away before an announcement

01:56:03.843 --> 01:56:06.464
[SPEAKER_06]: I would imagine we'd get an announcement sooner than later anyways

01:56:19.808 --> 01:56:24.553
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to say, because usually the console that came out first was the one that fell on its ass.

01:56:24.673 --> 01:56:29.939
[SPEAKER_08]: Because we're all looking at the Wii U going, you know, maybe Lightning's not going to strike twice this time.

01:56:29.959 --> 01:56:31.500
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's why.

01:56:31.801 --> 01:56:32.822
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

01:56:33.763 --> 01:56:41.190
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously, the Wii U, I'm kind of disappointed with the fact that they aren't going to try to up the graphics to, yeah, okay, it's slightly better than 360.

01:56:43.753 --> 01:56:49.157
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's going to have to be slightly better than that because the 360 is going to be done with by the time that it comes out.

01:56:49.798 --> 01:56:57.123
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so if it's a good system, Microsoft can have a year head start on everyone and win ultimately the market.

01:56:57.512 --> 01:57:02.854
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, Nintendo will have a chance, though, at next year's E3 to really wow the shit out of us.

01:57:02.894 --> 01:57:06.915
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, the nice thing about where Nintendo's going, they get a second chance.

01:57:07.495 --> 01:57:14.858
[SPEAKER_08]: So next year, if they can do it, they can put out games that have fucking sweet graphics that use this whole tablet thing that just blow our fucking mind.

01:57:14.898 --> 01:57:15.818
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, they have a chance.

01:57:15.958 --> 01:57:17.079
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got a prediction for you.

01:57:18.099 --> 01:57:19.659
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not gonna be ready for next year.

01:57:20.420 --> 01:57:21.220
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not gonna be ready.

01:57:21.420 --> 01:57:21.800
[SPEAKER_06]: You think?

01:57:21.840 --> 01:57:23.302
[SPEAKER_06]: You're calling a Wii U delay already?

01:57:23.342 --> 01:57:25.003
[SPEAKER_06]: Wii U is not coming out in 2012.

01:57:25.504 --> 01:57:25.964
[SPEAKER_06]: You think?

01:57:26.605 --> 01:57:28.427
[SPEAKER_06]: And do you think it's because of its cold reception?

01:57:28.447 --> 01:57:29.728
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's because they got nothing.

01:57:29.848 --> 01:57:30.809
[SPEAKER_06]: They have nothing.

01:57:31.089 --> 01:57:32.911
[SPEAKER_08]: They have a bunch of tech demos and that's it.

01:57:32.931 --> 01:57:34.112
[SPEAKER_08]: Proof of concept, that's it.

01:57:34.152 --> 01:57:34.873
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's the problem.

01:57:35.253 --> 01:57:40.638
[SPEAKER_08]: If the 3DS doesn't make a recovery this holiday, and I don't know, I still think it's too early to say.

01:57:40.798 --> 01:57:45.343
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the Mario Kart and the Mario games are going to go a long way in putting these things under kids' Christmas trees this year.

01:57:45.963 --> 01:57:51.285
[SPEAKER_08]: But if the 3DS doesn't gain a lot of steam quickly, what are they going to have next year?

01:57:52.245 --> 01:57:52.565
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing.

01:57:55.086 --> 01:58:01.367
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to really put pressure on to get the Wii U out or they're going to have to give in to investors and start making iPhone games.

01:58:01.447 --> 01:58:02.928
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but that's the thing.

01:58:02.988 --> 01:58:07.009
[SPEAKER_06]: If they're going to rush the Wii U, come on.

01:58:07.709 --> 01:58:13.391
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to see these games that, oh, we were developing this for the Wii, but we decided to put it on the Wii type situation.

01:58:14.751 --> 01:58:14.871
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

01:58:16.234 --> 01:58:17.034
[SPEAKER_06]: Like the last story.

01:58:17.334 --> 01:58:23.718
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo has been the more family-friendly, affordable model since, really, the N64.

01:58:24.279 --> 01:58:27.461
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't like the fact that the tablet controller is a terminal.

01:58:27.521 --> 01:58:29.042
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't have any processor in it.

01:58:29.242 --> 01:58:29.862
[SPEAKER_05]: It's simply a...

01:58:31.343 --> 01:58:37.125
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Sprinto needs to realize that people are fucking buying iPads for their goddamn kids and iPads aren't fucking cheap.

01:58:37.525 --> 01:58:40.586
[SPEAKER_06]: You can make your console more expensive and people will still buy it.

01:58:41.047 --> 01:58:42.367
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not going to go, oh my god.

01:58:42.587 --> 01:58:43.688
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't give them too many ideas.

01:58:43.808 --> 01:58:52.871
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I understand that, but I'm just saying, you know, if you're buying a fucking $200 piece of equipment for your child, I mean, shit.

01:58:53.471 --> 01:58:54.892
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they will spend $300 on a console.

01:58:56.637 --> 01:58:59.661
[SPEAKER_08]: Brad from PodCulture is in our chatroom and wants me to make a bet with Loki.

01:59:01.364 --> 01:59:02.265
[SPEAKER_06]: Stop it.

01:59:02.826 --> 01:59:03.727
[SPEAKER_06]: Stop it, okay?

01:59:04.288 --> 01:59:06.470
[SPEAKER_06]: You had your chance, and you blew it.

01:59:07.272 --> 01:59:09.454
[SPEAKER_06]: All you had to do was generate a few sales...

01:59:10.998 --> 01:59:17.002
[SPEAKER_06]: A few hundred thousand sales of Eye of Judgment, and that was it.

01:59:17.122 --> 01:59:17.982
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you would have had it.

01:59:18.122 --> 01:59:26.387
[SPEAKER_06]: But, see, the Wii U does sound ridiculous, but... Once again, it's something like, all these developers are so excited.

01:59:26.667 --> 01:59:34.212
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that these developers seriously don't get enough sun, because it's... Oh, wow, it's a tablet that interacts... Do you think they all have vitamin D deficiencies?

01:59:34.432 --> 01:59:36.854
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like it's a tablet that interacts with this console.

01:59:37.814 --> 01:59:41.456
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, they've got like... And the tablet does shit by itself.

01:59:41.496 --> 01:59:42.957
[SPEAKER_05]: You need the console tethered to it.

01:59:44.477 --> 01:59:45.418
[SPEAKER_06]: But you know what, though?

01:59:45.738 --> 01:59:51.021
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not... You say that like it's a bad thing, but look at the on-live stuff.

01:59:51.861 --> 01:59:57.524
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a console that interacts with a server that basically streams the gaming to it.

01:59:58.064 --> 01:59:58.344
[SPEAKER_06]: True.

01:59:58.464 --> 01:59:59.385
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the same thing.

02:00:00.085 --> 02:00:01.526
[SPEAKER_06]: But once again, I'm like...

02:00:03.078 --> 02:00:04.359
[SPEAKER_06]: That tablet looks stupid.

02:00:04.940 --> 02:00:09.424
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, oh goody, we can put my, you know, my inventory down on this.

02:00:09.485 --> 02:00:13.248
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what, you could do that also with the DS or something.

02:00:13.328 --> 02:00:16.592
[SPEAKER_06]: You can have it where it interacts with the actual consoles.

02:00:16.612 --> 02:00:18.153
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, the DS could do that.

02:00:18.654 --> 02:00:19.975
[SPEAKER_06]: Same with the 3DS could do that.

02:00:20.375 --> 02:00:22.097
[SPEAKER_06]: But they didn't fucking do that.

02:00:24.039 --> 02:00:24.840
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, it's just...

02:00:26.820 --> 02:00:28.362
[SPEAKER_08]: They're gonna need a lot more than what they've got

02:00:42.382 --> 02:00:58.244
[SPEAKER_08]: and it did look pretty fucking sweet I gotta say and like you know I like Batman I don't know why I didn't buy this game at launch but I guess I'm just not I'm not usually very good at the 3D action games I think that's kind of part of it but there's a part of me that's going kind of want with this game

02:00:58.965 --> 02:01:02.886
[SPEAKER_08]: But then I read this crap and I go, maybe I shouldn't buy it right away.

02:01:03.646 --> 02:01:08.367
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember how we've been talking about Project $10 applies to this game and it's not even multiplayer.

02:01:08.767 --> 02:01:09.908
[SPEAKER_08]: No, they've done the Catwoman.

02:01:09.968 --> 02:01:11.468
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, they have to run the servers.

02:01:11.868 --> 02:01:14.109
[SPEAKER_06]: You understand, they have to run the servers.

02:01:14.449 --> 02:01:15.609
[SPEAKER_06]: Think of the servers.

02:01:15.669 --> 02:01:24.311
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what really, the only thing that ticks me off about the whole thing is that they really made Catwoman sound like she was an integral part of the game and like it's all part of it.

02:01:24.331 --> 02:01:26.472
[SPEAKER_08]: And now it's DLC, you know, essentially.

02:01:26.912 --> 02:01:27.833
[SPEAKER_08]: PAY TO UNLOCK CONTENT

02:01:42.609 --> 02:01:48.331
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I don't, I don't, I think it's like a, uh, I was listening to Bobby's show earlier, and one of his callers said that it was a 200 megabyte download.

02:01:48.531 --> 02:01:48.771
[SPEAKER_10]: Really?

02:01:48.951 --> 02:01:49.091
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

02:01:49.972 --> 02:01:50.772
[SPEAKER_08]: So it must come with other stuff.

02:01:50.792 --> 02:01:51.052
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

02:01:52.073 --> 02:01:53.873
[SPEAKER_08]: Do some investigative reporting, Loki.

02:01:54.253 --> 02:01:55.534
[SPEAKER_08]: Meanwhile, okay, here's the deal.

02:01:56.294 --> 02:01:59.795
[SPEAKER_08]: The thing that kind of, you know, ticked me off and made me go, maybe I shouldn't have rushed into this.

02:02:00.216 --> 02:02:03.917
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently, those download codes are showing up, and they don't work.

02:02:04.017 --> 02:02:06.418
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of them don't work, some of them are just fucking blank.

02:02:06.778 --> 02:02:32.737
[SPEAKER_08]: and there's a picture circulating around the internet of cards that went into boxes with no codes on them and actually from a factory production standpoint this makes a lot of sense they probably have an assembly line and a machine that picks up these cards and runs them through a printer and the machine probably if it picks up two at a time on accident which is bound to happen why this ever can't happen to me at the ATM machine I don't know but in the factory it picks up two at a time and then one of them doesn't get a code yet still goes in the game

02:02:33.417 --> 02:02:39.326
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah, so it was going out there and these people that were looking forward to playing as Catwoman were kind of screwed.

02:02:39.667 --> 02:02:44.014
[SPEAKER_08]: However, Warner does have a five-step process to get this fixed.

02:02:44.214 --> 02:02:45.135
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, fair enough.

02:02:45.176 --> 02:02:46.718
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a couple hundred meg download.

02:02:46.738 --> 02:02:47.880
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so be it.

02:02:48.243 --> 02:02:57.308
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so apparently you call customer service and you give them a dated proof of purchase, like a receipt, that shows a new copy of the game, not eBay or not rented.

02:02:57.668 --> 02:03:00.730
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to give your gamer tag for Xbox Live or PSN.

02:03:01.090 --> 02:03:08.494
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to give your email address, a scan or digital picture of the package and game disc, and a scan or digital picture of the code sheet.

02:03:08.835 --> 02:03:10.816
[SPEAKER_08]: Once you send all that in, they'll give you the code.

02:03:11.056 --> 02:03:13.077
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a lot of work for their mistake.

02:03:13.637 --> 02:03:14.338
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, right?

02:03:15.018 --> 02:03:17.240
[SPEAKER_08]: I seem to recall last time a developer fucked up.

02:03:17.280 --> 02:03:19.381
[SPEAKER_08]: Wasn't it Deus Ex that had this problem?

02:03:19.481 --> 02:03:25.025
[SPEAKER_08]: One of those had a code, and it got fucked up, so they just ended up having to give it to everybody.

02:03:25.065 --> 02:03:25.626
[SPEAKER_06]: It was Driver.

02:03:25.806 --> 02:03:26.326
[SPEAKER_06]: It was Driver.

02:03:26.346 --> 02:03:26.666
[SPEAKER_06]: It was Driver.

02:03:26.726 --> 02:03:30.569
[SPEAKER_06]: Driver, they forgot to put the code in one of the packages.

02:03:30.649 --> 02:03:32.290
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it was 360 or PS3.

02:03:32.330 --> 02:03:34.172
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't remember what was one of those two.

02:03:35.092 --> 02:03:37.514
[SPEAKER_06]: They forgot to put in the Uplay code.

02:03:39.835 --> 02:03:47.720
[SPEAKER_08]: But this is apparently like people, this is going back to the days of when people would call in sick to work and stay up all night to play a video game.

02:03:47.740 --> 02:03:49.801
[SPEAKER_08]: Like this game is having that effect on people.

02:03:50.301 --> 02:03:55.925
[SPEAKER_08]: Like people that I know that aren't even that into video games are just going apeshit crazy over this.

02:03:56.305 --> 02:04:04.550
[SPEAKER_06]: And trust me people, I mean if you really want to get this free code and you maybe have purchased a used copy already, I mean come on.

02:04:04.890 --> 02:04:07.711
[SPEAKER_06]: You need a picture of the pack shot and a receipt.

02:04:08.892 --> 02:04:11.253
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we can find one on Google Image Search.

02:04:12.333 --> 02:04:13.053
[SPEAKER_08]: I love this.

02:04:13.694 --> 02:04:23.097
[SPEAKER_08]: Tigerclaw linked a picture in chatroom of a midnight launch at his local Evil G, and one of the employees is dressed up as the Joker with the Why So Serious makeup.

02:04:23.737 --> 02:04:24.957
[SPEAKER_08]: At least people are getting into it.

02:04:26.218 --> 02:04:26.478
[SPEAKER_08]: Lol.

02:04:28.337 --> 02:04:30.458
[SPEAKER_08]: Shame on you for giving that place your business.

02:04:30.838 --> 02:04:31.678
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

02:04:31.758 --> 02:04:35.719
[SPEAKER_06]: This is where I'm going to get in my sandbox once again about this whole code crap.

02:04:36.239 --> 02:04:49.382
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would like to pose this question, and I'm sure no developers of these types of games actually listen to this show, but maybe after we hopefully win the podcast awards, someone will go back in the archives and hear my rant.

02:04:50.791 --> 02:05:00.636
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I always hear the complaint, or I should say the argument from people in favor of these $10 codes and online passes and stuff.

02:05:01.056 --> 02:05:05.598
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the developers don't get any money from used sales.

02:05:05.618 --> 02:05:10.961
[SPEAKER_06]: They just don't get any money, and those servers cost money to maintain, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

02:05:11.741 --> 02:05:15.084
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, developers, how much of that $10 do you actually get?

02:05:15.304 --> 02:05:23.910
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I'm going to be willing to bet that you get nothing from those $10 vouchers that get redeemed or whatever.

02:05:24.451 --> 02:05:30.676
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm betting it's $0 is what you get, and it all goes to the publisher to pad their numbers.

02:05:30.736 --> 02:05:37.681
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, some of that I'm sure will go to running their servers because, hey, if you can run your servers cheaper than you are now, then why not?

02:05:40.086 --> 02:05:41.186
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to see the receipts.

02:06:00.715 --> 02:06:04.782
[SPEAKER_06]: I want someone to say, hey, we get a buck for each time someone buys this thing.

02:06:05.263 --> 02:06:07.487
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I'd like to see, but I doubt it.

02:06:08.088 --> 02:06:10.031
[SPEAKER_06]: I doubt that they get very much money from that.

02:06:11.650 --> 02:06:11.950
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

02:06:12.571 --> 02:06:14.913
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's move on to the mailbag.

02:06:15.074 --> 02:06:19.378
[SPEAKER_08]: Every week, you guys send us emails at mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.

02:06:19.758 --> 02:06:25.464
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, normally, DarkSakura will dive into the email bag headfirst and pull out some of her favorite emails to read on air.

02:06:25.964 --> 02:06:28.587
[SPEAKER_08]: However, as you guys are aware, she's not here tonight.

02:06:29.087 --> 02:06:34.433
[SPEAKER_08]: So she has asked Salacious Pop to put on the biohazard suit and jump in there on her behalf.

02:06:34.993 --> 02:06:37.755
[SPEAKER_08]: So, Salacious Pop, what's in the emails tonight?

02:06:38.075 --> 02:06:51.285
[SPEAKER_05]: First email tonight is from Robert M, and he writes, Evening, you probably already got feedback about this, but the free downloadable Zelda Four Swords is not a 3DS exclusive, but it's available on the DSi models as well.

02:06:51.885 --> 02:06:59.210
[SPEAKER_05]: I am very glad to see that they added a single player mode, allowing the player to have a second link follow him around and switch control to either character.

02:06:59.791 --> 02:07:02.953
[SPEAKER_05]: Overall, this is the kind of effort Nintendo should be putting into its re-releases.

02:07:03.985 --> 02:07:05.005
[SPEAKER_05]: Now on to toys!

02:07:07.667 --> 02:07:25.114
[SPEAKER_05]: I have had and not had an interest in Spyro since the Insomniac days, and while I sympathize with the storage issues and definitely the high buy-in, the concept of Skylander seems kind of cool, even though I'm sure the game itself would probably be fairly simplistic.

02:07:25.874 --> 02:07:34.438
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen other game slash toys like this, although those were probably an in-package code rather than direct peripheral transfer of memory.

02:07:35.419 --> 02:07:41.482
[SPEAKER_05]: Some online racing games with toy cars, and some MMO called Freaky Creatures, whose action figures I've seen at Best Buy.

02:07:42.302 --> 02:07:44.924
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't seen either of these in stores for a while, though.

02:07:45.665 --> 02:07:49.128
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't seen as much integration with my Transformers action figures.

02:07:49.268 --> 02:07:57.395
[SPEAKER_05]: A line here and there may have a catalog with a code for an unlockable in one of the games, but these are rare and all the catalogs have the same code.

02:07:57.875 --> 02:08:01.698
[SPEAKER_05]: My question is, have you seen a more successful toy game integration?

02:08:02.899 --> 02:08:05.179
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, would you call those music games toys?

02:08:05.439 --> 02:08:08.100
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, like the guitar, the plastic guitars, are those toys?

02:08:08.240 --> 02:08:10.920
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it kind of depends on your definition of toy.

02:08:11.261 --> 02:08:19.762
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I think it's, what he's asking is, what was that card game for the Sony that bombed and never came out, Eye of Judgment?

02:08:19.782 --> 02:08:20.502
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Eye of Judgment.

02:08:20.602 --> 02:08:24.823
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where you're kind of buying a physical thing to bring into the game.

02:08:25.563 --> 02:08:28.924
[SPEAKER_05]: With the Skylanders, you have to find these little action figures to play that character in the game.

02:08:28.984 --> 02:08:30.964
[SPEAKER_05]: So what have there been that's similar to that?

02:08:31.425 --> 02:08:38.353
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you have to go from the disc generations forward, because obviously with the cartridge scenario, that just didn't happen.

02:08:38.793 --> 02:08:48.324
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I remember old school VCR games that tied in with toys, but that stuff didn't work very well, and it was all just for show in the commercials and stuff.

02:08:49.526 --> 02:08:50.507
[SPEAKER_08]: But as far as like...

02:08:51.548 --> 02:08:52.769
[SPEAKER_08]: toys with games.

02:08:53.590 --> 02:08:54.130
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure.

02:08:54.210 --> 02:08:55.231
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, can you think of anything?

02:08:55.291 --> 02:08:59.874
[SPEAKER_08]: Any type of, like, where they sold toys that integrated with the game, like this does?

02:08:59.974 --> 02:09:00.875
[SPEAKER_06]: That integrated the game?

02:09:01.035 --> 02:09:02.036
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

02:09:02.096 --> 02:09:02.676
[SPEAKER_06]: Connectimals.

02:09:02.776 --> 02:09:14.745
[SPEAKER_06]: They had little scans where you can basically interact with different, you know, you can buy toys, or they had collector's editions that came with stuffed animals that you could play with the actual game with.

02:09:14.785 --> 02:09:16.246
[SPEAKER_06]: Viva Pinata had some...

02:09:17.915 --> 02:09:19.119
[SPEAKER_06]: Did Viva Pinata have that?

02:09:19.159 --> 02:09:21.325
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they had a little thing where you could scan your...

02:09:25.191 --> 02:09:25.892
[SPEAKER_06]: They tried.

02:09:26.192 --> 02:09:27.272
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't going to happen.

02:09:27.293 --> 02:09:28.073
[SPEAKER_08]: Some people enjoyed it.

02:09:28.173 --> 02:09:28.914
[SPEAKER_08]: Some people really did.

02:09:28.934 --> 02:09:30.335
[SPEAKER_08]: But remember they had the cartoon?

02:09:30.515 --> 02:09:32.116
[SPEAKER_08]: They were really trying to make an empire out of that.

02:09:32.136 --> 02:09:43.424
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to count Babysitting Mama, because Babysitting Mama had the doll that you shoved the Wii Remote up into its nether regions and would interact that way.

02:09:43.444 --> 02:09:45.825
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't worry, Mama will fix it.

02:09:47.006 --> 02:09:47.987
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see, what else?

02:09:48.487 --> 02:09:51.229
[SPEAKER_08]: The chat room is yelling Captain Power.

02:09:51.269 --> 02:09:53.851
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's what they're thinking of the VCR stuff I'm talking about.

02:09:55.499 --> 02:09:56.320
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, wow.

02:09:56.340 --> 02:09:57.761
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I remember that.

02:09:57.841 --> 02:09:59.943
[SPEAKER_05]: That was kind of like a rich kid's toy for me.

02:09:59.963 --> 02:10:01.724
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that shit was cheap as hell, though.

02:10:01.844 --> 02:10:04.206
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't ever own one, but, you know, I had the rich friends.

02:10:04.766 --> 02:10:07.028
[SPEAKER_08]: And so, you know, they did.

02:10:10.158 --> 02:10:11.298
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what you do when you're poor.

02:10:11.358 --> 02:10:12.518
[SPEAKER_08]: You make friends with rich people.

02:10:14.339 --> 02:10:15.459
[SPEAKER_08]: Through your sass and wit.

02:10:16.360 --> 02:10:16.660
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

02:10:19.061 --> 02:10:20.141
[SPEAKER_08]: Salacious Pop, what's next?

02:10:21.702 --> 02:10:30.125
[SPEAKER_05]: Chiggers writes, asking OLR, or rather, asking DarkSakura, who's not here, an update on her PlayStation tester application.

02:10:30.465 --> 02:10:33.087
[SPEAKER_08]: I can actually give you that, even though DarkSakura's not here tonight.

02:10:33.827 --> 02:10:35.188
[SPEAKER_08]: She decided not to go through with it.

02:10:35.688 --> 02:10:40.150
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was a discussion between her and Dan about the whole, like, if I actually got it, I have to relocate.

02:10:40.811 --> 02:10:43.112
[SPEAKER_08]: Keep in mind, Dan just recently got employed again.

02:10:43.592 --> 02:10:47.654
[SPEAKER_08]: He was working a game crazy up until they all went under, and he's employed again.

02:10:47.714 --> 02:10:51.356
[SPEAKER_08]: So they made a personal decision that it's just not the right time for DarkSakura to do that.

02:10:51.797 --> 02:10:55.739
[SPEAKER_08]: As funny as it would have been, she has to think not just for herself.

02:10:55.999 --> 02:10:57.640
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, she has a husband, so they...

02:10:58.340 --> 02:10:59.802
[SPEAKER_08]: They didn't go through with it, which is too bad.

02:11:01.724 --> 02:11:04.306
[SPEAKER_08]: Unfortunately, Salacious Pop's application got in too late, right?

02:11:04.346 --> 02:11:04.927
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm just kidding.

02:11:06.528 --> 02:11:07.109
[SPEAKER_08]: Just messing.

02:11:07.910 --> 02:11:11.914
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to see you go on that show and claw some 21-year-old's eyes out for being a bitch.

02:11:13.195 --> 02:11:14.256
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm probably too old.

02:11:14.316 --> 02:11:14.917
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure it's gone.

02:11:14.937 --> 02:11:17.159
[SPEAKER_08]: You'd be grandpa on that show.

02:11:17.399 --> 02:11:18.761
[SPEAKER_08]: There's usually one or two people in their 30s.

02:11:19.561 --> 02:11:20.562
[SPEAKER_06]: that are in the cast somehow.

02:11:22.463 --> 02:11:32.969
[SPEAKER_06]: They have one that I watched just because it was just the part of it because Freddie Wong is in it briefly.

02:11:33.130 --> 02:11:36.752
[SPEAKER_06]: He posted it on his Facebook page but it's like some Battlefield thing called The Controller.

02:11:37.072 --> 02:11:41.975
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a bunch of these noobs team up with these pro gamers and they have to play Battlefield 3.

02:11:42.535 --> 02:11:44.376
[SPEAKER_06]: It's basically a big advertisement for Battlefield 3.

02:11:46.278 --> 02:11:47.799
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, all those shows are dumb.

02:11:52.513 --> 02:11:54.334
[SPEAKER_08]: You can test games for the PlayStation 4!

02:11:54.374 --> 02:11:55.255
[SPEAKER_08]: And we'll kick in the nuts!

02:12:06.665 --> 02:12:31.050
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what happened to the second guy that won like I know a gay guy won the second season his handle was like gamer and I haven't heard a lot about what happened to him but I knew the guy that won the first season actually like he only tested for like six months and he moved into the part at Sony that he really wanted to do it was it's that whole thing was really about just getting your foot in the damn door but I'd be curious about did they hire anyone else from the shows you know how like sometimes like like American Idol

02:12:31.950 --> 02:12:33.111
[SPEAKER_08]: Chris Daughtry didn't win.

02:12:33.191 --> 02:12:34.952
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're in the top three, you're getting a record deal.

02:12:35.132 --> 02:12:36.112
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

02:12:39.113 --> 02:12:40.574
[SPEAKER_05]: Next email is from Jamjay.

02:12:41.335 --> 02:12:44.176
[SPEAKER_08]: Jamjay writes... Holy shit, I haven't heard that name in forever.

02:12:44.196 --> 02:12:46.097
[SPEAKER_05]: That guy used to show up live a lot.

02:12:46.977 --> 02:12:48.898
[SPEAKER_05]: This week I picked up Rocksmith for the 360, a...

02:12:58.065 --> 02:13:06.247
[SPEAKER_05]: My thoughts on the game itself is that it is more of a training slash drill tool than game.

02:13:07.247 --> 02:13:15.369
[SPEAKER_05]: For many, this would be a turn-off, but as an extreme novice at guitar, I found it was decent and made otherwise boring practice a bit better.

02:13:16.089 --> 02:13:21.571
[SPEAKER_05]: The game functions as an amplifier for the guitar and has a free mode where you can just free play your guitar.

02:13:22.391 --> 02:13:29.236
[SPEAKER_05]: I would recommend Rocksmith for those that want to learn a bit of guitar but aren't taking formal lessons.

02:13:30.497 --> 02:13:35.961
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the drawbacks is that you have to grind songs repetitively in order to open up new modes.

02:13:36.322 --> 02:13:38.443
[SPEAKER_05]: However, it does make you practice.

02:13:39.684 --> 02:13:47.610
[SPEAKER_05]: After the 30 minutes of starting the game, I found I was able to play a simplified version of Satisfaction, which wasn't bad at all.

02:13:49.221 --> 02:13:51.864
[SPEAKER_05]: I used a basic strat style electric guitar.

02:13:51.985 --> 02:13:57.412
[SPEAKER_05]: Rocksmith will work with any electric guitar with a quarter inch jack.

02:13:58.233 --> 02:14:02.578
[SPEAKER_05]: I give this game the tomato frog stamp of approval for learning basic guitar.

02:14:02.798 --> 02:14:03.039
[SPEAKER_05]: GMJ.

02:14:03.971 --> 02:14:05.512
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that actually is not a bad review.

02:14:05.592 --> 02:14:08.974
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I like that he says it's more of a tool than a game.

02:14:10.115 --> 02:14:15.219
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'd be curious to see how much this catches on, if at all.

02:14:15.359 --> 02:14:22.443
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I think people are, like, they're just too ready to throw it into the rock band and guitar hero pile than to see what it really is.

02:14:22.583 --> 02:14:31.469
[SPEAKER_08]: But I appreciate the review because this was something that, I gotta admit, I don't really have a super-duper interest in learning to play the guitar, but it sounds like a neat way to learn.

02:14:32.190 --> 02:14:33.871
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm more of a keyboard person, keep in mind.

02:14:34.431 --> 02:14:46.242
[SPEAKER_05]: Piano, that stuff And our last email of the evening is from Fabrice in Belgium and he writes Hello OLR I love international emails Just saying

02:14:47.222 --> 02:14:49.283
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm thinking about filling up that gap next year on this convention.

02:15:14.560 --> 02:15:21.569
[SPEAKER_05]: although I don't know too much about him I've never had a chance to play Silent Hill he looks like such a badass character

02:15:22.990 --> 02:15:50.369
[SPEAKER_05]: Halloween's coming you really should check out Silent Hill I have something to whine about too it seems that every single game has downloadable content nowadays as I was randomly going through the Xbox Live Marketplace I saw there was even downloadable content for such a small and simple game as Fruit Ninja Connect I do get that developers and publishers want to make some more extra money but it's just crazy it feels more and more like content that should be included in the game when you first buy it

02:15:52.285 --> 02:15:56.528
[SPEAKER_05]: In two years time, if this trend continues, we will only buy half games for the full price.

02:15:56.628 --> 02:15:59.030
[SPEAKER_08]: I hate to say it, this trend's already been going for a long time.

02:15:59.230 --> 02:16:02.132
[SPEAKER_08]: And a lot of this is, you know, iOS has a lot of this too.

02:16:02.553 --> 02:16:06.716
[SPEAKER_08]: This is just kind of the world we live in right now and you really have to vote with your dollars.

02:16:06.876 --> 02:16:08.437
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't buy half-assed games.

02:16:08.757 --> 02:16:09.058
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't.

02:16:09.998 --> 02:16:10.699
[SPEAKER_08]: Do your research.

02:16:11.607 --> 02:16:14.149
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, as always, thanks a lot for making the show every week.

02:16:14.189 --> 02:16:15.230
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys really are awesome.

02:16:15.630 --> 02:16:18.212
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm voting almost every day for you guys for the podcast awards.

02:16:18.472 --> 02:16:19.853
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the least I can do for you.

02:16:20.033 --> 02:16:20.734
[SPEAKER_05]: Aw, shucks.

02:16:21.954 --> 02:16:22.315
[SPEAKER_08]: Shucks.

02:16:22.355 --> 02:16:22.875
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks so much.

02:16:22.895 --> 02:16:23.816
[SPEAKER_08]: Fabrice in Belgium.

02:16:24.056 --> 02:16:25.237
[SPEAKER_08]: Really appreciate it, Fabrice.

02:16:25.677 --> 02:16:29.560
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, his story about the Sci-Fi convention, all the excitement that kind of went with that.

02:16:29.640 --> 02:16:32.422
[SPEAKER_08]: I bet a lot of that excitement is just being with other nerds.

02:16:32.882 --> 02:16:36.106
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that my first E3 was a lot like that.

02:16:36.186 --> 02:16:39.909
[SPEAKER_08]: It was all these professional people that really happened to be big fucking nerds like me.

02:16:40.410 --> 02:16:45.475
[SPEAKER_08]: I loved my first E3 and I don't think I'll ever go to one as good as that because of that.

02:16:45.776 --> 02:16:48.278
[SPEAKER_08]: It just reminded me of some other thing I read this week.

02:16:48.318 --> 02:16:48.799
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you see...

02:16:50.148 --> 02:16:51.349
[SPEAKER_08]: Here I go, opening Pandora's box.

02:16:51.869 --> 02:16:56.491
[SPEAKER_08]: There was some magazine, I want to say it was Men's Health, that did this piece on New York Comic Con.

02:16:56.951 --> 02:17:01.853
[SPEAKER_08]: And they just basically sent a photographer there to take pictures of fat cosplayers to put it on their website and make fun of them.

02:17:01.913 --> 02:17:08.236
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, you know, guys dressed as Captain America or something like that that have the beer bellies and things like that.

02:17:08.276 --> 02:17:08.796
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was just like...

02:17:09.576 --> 02:17:19.219
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it's obviously men's health, so I don't know if they're just trying to make people feel bad about themselves, so they'll subscribe to the magazine to, I don't know, get health tips, but the whole thing just came off as hella fucking rude.

02:17:19.599 --> 02:17:24.941
[SPEAKER_08]: And like, you know, obviously Twitter and the internet, rightfully so, is pissed and demanding an apology.

02:17:24.981 --> 02:17:26.061
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if they ever got one.

02:17:26.081 --> 02:17:28.082
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't follow the story that much, but it's just...

02:17:29.823 --> 02:17:32.804
[SPEAKER_08]: Just so classless.

02:17:33.304 --> 02:17:38.306
[SPEAKER_08]: But just all reason not to get that magazine, I suppose, that they're just going to be rude like that.

02:17:38.826 --> 02:17:44.208
[SPEAKER_08]: Who even in a boardroom, I mean office, or a story editor thinks that's funny?

02:17:44.568 --> 02:17:48.370
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's go to New York Comic Con and take pictures of fat people and we'll put them in the magazine.

02:17:48.830 --> 02:17:50.931
[SPEAKER_08]: That's like what the bullies did in high school.

02:17:51.851 --> 02:17:54.252
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's go pick on the fags and put them in the trash can.

02:17:55.372 --> 02:17:57.033
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just ridiculous.

02:17:58.789 --> 02:18:19.348
[SPEAKER_08]: shame on everybody involved with that and to the people that have the guts to dress up like in tights when they may not have perfect bodies I say props to you props to you for having the guts to get out there and do that cause those people that write for the magazines often won't even put their fucking pictures in the mag let's see a picture of the guy that wrote that article see what he looks like I bet he's not perfect

02:18:21.627 --> 02:18:32.296
[SPEAKER_05]: One last thing, we did get your email, DKPopMan, and also a shout out for TheDoctor90125, but what you talked about is actually coming up in just a few minutes, but we got your email.

02:18:32.616 --> 02:18:33.557
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, DKPopMan.

02:18:34.518 --> 02:18:35.338
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, hello and thank you.

02:18:35.498 --> 02:18:42.043
[SPEAKER_08]: We always don't have time to do every email either, and I think that's important to keep in mind.

02:18:42.204 --> 02:18:42.744
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it for Mailbag.

02:18:42.764 --> 02:18:43.985
[SPEAKER_08]: But we do read them all.

02:18:44.085 --> 02:18:44.345
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

02:18:44.705 --> 02:18:52.127
[SPEAKER_08]: Ranma posted that actually his show, Anime Jam Session, a friend of ours, actually wrote this whole counter article to it.

02:18:53.047 --> 02:18:54.187
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not going to reread the whole thing.

02:18:54.227 --> 02:18:55.247
[SPEAKER_08]: He's posted it in chat.

02:18:55.708 --> 02:18:59.808
[SPEAKER_08]: The whole thing is infuriating enough where I really don't want to spend any more time talking about it.

02:18:59.868 --> 02:19:05.050
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you just want to see reasons why you should be mad, go read it.

02:19:05.550 --> 02:19:10.671
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't have to be fat to support fat rights because, you know...

02:19:11.831 --> 02:19:14.252
[SPEAKER_08]: How's that old saying go?

02:19:14.913 --> 02:19:21.436
[SPEAKER_08]: At first they didn't come for me and I said nothing and then they came for me and no one said anything.

02:19:21.676 --> 02:19:22.196
[SPEAKER_08]: Something like that.

02:19:22.637 --> 02:19:25.318
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody in chat will remind me what that is.

02:19:25.358 --> 02:19:27.679
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, let's move on with some more news.

02:19:29.400 --> 02:19:33.002
[SPEAKER_06]: It's hard to believe that this damn thing is so popular.

02:19:36.003 --> 02:19:36.604
[SPEAKER_06]: Angry Birds.

02:19:38.004 --> 02:19:38.585
[SPEAKER_06]: They're getting...

02:19:40.310 --> 02:19:43.211
[SPEAKER_06]: A film, and why?

02:19:43.311 --> 02:19:49.612
[SPEAKER_06]: Have they really run out of that many ideas that they have to create a movie based on this game?

02:19:49.952 --> 02:19:50.632
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't make any sense.

02:19:50.672 --> 02:19:55.033
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyways, the game's been downloaded over 400 million times, so they probably think, hey, you know what?

02:19:55.053 --> 02:19:57.153
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me make some money off that movie.

02:19:59.534 --> 02:20:04.335
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, their revenue, Rovio is currently valued at $1.2 billion.

02:20:04.435 --> 02:20:06.035
[SPEAKER_06]: It's ridiculous.

02:20:07.035 --> 02:20:08.116
[SPEAKER_06]: Ridiculous, I say.

02:20:09.936 --> 02:20:36.924
[SPEAKER_06]: and to kind of go along with that Ubisoft they have a wonderful franchise called Assassin's Creed and Sony has apparently bought the rights to make a movie based on it and this is coming from also the fact that Sony has just recently started registering a bunch of websites for an Assassin's Creed movie so it's a good indicator and

02:20:38.104 --> 02:21:01.157
[SPEAKER_06]: Assassin's Creed might make a pretty good movie I think it could because it actually has a pretty decent storyline to go along with it so I could see that I see it more so than Angry Birds that's for sure Angry Birds has no plot I mean other than you know they're mad at pigs there's pigs and they did something that angered the birds and so you launch I mean I don't want to watch a movie where it's just birds flinging themselves at walls all movie long

02:21:01.445 --> 02:21:13.893
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember growing up in the 80s when Saturday morning cartoons were a thing and you had these really awful Saturday morning cartoons that were only on for a season that promoted the toys and the toys were there to promote the cartoon.

02:21:14.434 --> 02:21:17.196
[SPEAKER_05]: Why not just have an Angry Birds cartoon?

02:21:17.956 --> 02:21:18.236
[SPEAKER_05]: Right?

02:21:18.496 --> 02:21:20.438
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean... Makes sense.

02:21:21.679 --> 02:21:26.422
[SPEAKER_05]: But again, little kids don't have $400 smartphones to play the damn game on.

02:21:27.302 --> 02:21:31.165
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, it's like, why can't you just... You can play the game on almost everything now.

02:21:31.405 --> 02:21:34.868
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah, it's on Google+, and the port on Google+, is actually pretty good.

02:21:34.968 --> 02:21:39.752
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's like, I just remember, why can't you just make a cartoon series to sell some plastic shit and be done with it?

02:21:39.852 --> 02:21:41.473
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why it needs a movie.

02:21:43.094 --> 02:21:43.435
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all.

02:22:07.637 --> 02:22:09.057
[SPEAKER_05]: SalaciousPop, do you want to start us off today?

02:22:10.238 --> 02:22:10.878
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, I guess.

02:22:11.398 --> 02:22:17.040
[SPEAKER_05]: F you to waking up with headaches, which is weird because it's like I was asleep.

02:22:17.140 --> 02:22:18.960
[SPEAKER_05]: I should feel awesome, but now I have a headache.

02:22:19.340 --> 02:22:21.461
[SPEAKER_05]: It got better, though, after once I got to brunch and ate.

02:22:21.801 --> 02:22:23.181
[SPEAKER_05]: So just headaches are annoying.

02:22:24.161 --> 02:22:24.942
[SPEAKER_05]: They make me sad.

02:22:25.402 --> 02:22:26.022
[SPEAKER_07]: Headaches suck.

02:22:26.142 --> 02:22:26.542
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree.

02:22:26.802 --> 02:22:27.562
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

02:22:27.782 --> 02:22:28.083
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki!

02:22:29.023 --> 02:22:29.763
[SPEAKER_07]: F you to waiting.

02:22:33.388 --> 02:22:34.949
[SPEAKER_05]: and DarkSakura.com

02:22:58.067 --> 02:23:08.293
[SPEAKER_08]: However, F you to the fact that I wasn't smart enough to take the time off anyway to drive down to Anaheim and go to DizCon, which was today, and just go to the parties.

02:23:08.574 --> 02:23:09.374
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, seriously.

02:23:09.534 --> 02:23:10.855
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, Slices Pop, am I right?

02:23:10.955 --> 02:23:15.818
[SPEAKER_08]: We should have just gone to Disneyland Friday, Saturday, and then went to the BlizzCon parties at night, right?

02:23:16.058 --> 02:23:16.298
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

02:23:16.799 --> 02:23:17.239
[SPEAKER_08]: Totally.

02:23:17.739 --> 02:23:18.660
[SPEAKER_08]: We're so stupid!

02:23:18.680 --> 02:23:23.423
[SPEAKER_08]: Oops, I'm so mad that the freaking outro's playing now.

02:23:27.641 --> 02:23:29.142
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's move on with some more gaming news.

02:23:29.182 --> 02:23:32.664
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, of course, Twitter topics and the Skype line coming very soon.

02:23:34.345 --> 02:23:36.566
[SPEAKER_08]: 3D Classics is this thing on the 3DS.

02:23:36.606 --> 02:23:40.168
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, they redid Excitebike and Urban Champion for some weird reason.

02:23:40.188 --> 02:23:42.089
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's been some other things in there as well, like Twinbee.

02:23:42.389 --> 02:23:43.009
[SPEAKER_08]: 3D Classics 3D Classics

02:24:12.822 --> 02:24:14.924
[SPEAKER_08]: It's super easy to program these, I'm sure.

02:24:15.484 --> 02:24:18.447
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's a way to get you to buy virtual console games all over again.

02:24:18.808 --> 02:24:22.211
[SPEAKER_05]: Do I really need to be reminded how bloody hard that game was?

02:24:22.611 --> 02:24:24.253
[SPEAKER_05]: But seriously, that game is so fucking good.

02:24:25.494 --> 02:24:30.900
[SPEAKER_08]: Some people say you remember it through rose-colored glasses and it's not that good, but the music is amazing.

02:24:31.240 --> 02:24:34.143
[SPEAKER_08]: The dungeon levels are hard as hell and they're fun.

02:24:34.663 --> 02:24:35.344
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just

02:24:35.624 --> 02:24:38.807
[SPEAKER_05]: I had to use the codes out of Nintendo Power Magazine to get any progress in that game.

02:24:39.047 --> 02:24:41.269
[SPEAKER_08]: Akaris fights Medusa Angels, or whatever it is.

02:24:41.929 --> 02:24:43.671
[SPEAKER_08]: Medusa fights Akaris Angels, you get the reverse.

02:24:45.412 --> 02:24:52.758
[SPEAKER_08]: My whole thing is that I'm really worried that if I were to purchase this, that the first time I get fucked over by an eggplant wizard, I'm going to throw my 3DS against the wall.

02:24:53.359 --> 02:24:54.920
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I used to throw my Nintendo controllers.

02:24:55.120 --> 02:24:57.102
[SPEAKER_08]: Because those eggplant wizards are fucking bastards.

02:24:57.122 --> 02:25:01.365
[SPEAKER_05]: And that music that plays when they get mad and they're like, you trolled me!

02:25:06.335 --> 02:25:08.616
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god, did you play a lot of Kid Icarus when you were younger?

02:25:09.396 --> 02:25:10.297
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, yeah.

02:25:10.697 --> 02:25:12.057
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh god, it's one of my favorites.

02:25:12.238 --> 02:25:16.599
[SPEAKER_05]: I completely missed the original Metroid train for the NES, and I was playing Kid Icarus instead.

02:25:16.719 --> 02:25:17.340
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait, here you go.

02:25:17.560 --> 02:25:19.861
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see if this music makes you think of the Eggplant Wizards.

02:25:20.041 --> 02:25:20.361
[SPEAKER_08]: You ready?

02:25:30.525 --> 02:25:32.166
[SPEAKER_08]: How's that little sound they made, right?

02:25:33.365 --> 02:25:37.687
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, when they saw you, they were very animated and upset and they squeaked at you.

02:25:37.767 --> 02:25:38.908
[SPEAKER_05]: And the little babies flew out.

02:25:39.008 --> 02:25:41.790
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you had to go see that nurse who kind of looked like a trapezoid.

02:25:41.890 --> 02:25:43.050
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, what was up with that?

02:25:46.292 --> 02:25:47.273
[SPEAKER_08]: Nurse trapezoid.

02:25:47.513 --> 02:25:49.114
[SPEAKER_08]: I need the eggplant curse removed.

02:25:52.291 --> 02:25:55.112
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, Salacious Pop, what do you have for us?

02:25:55.392 --> 02:26:05.597
[SPEAKER_05]: Soul Calibur V is getting a crossover franchise tie-in that makes sense and it's not Star Wars with Vader and Yoda and it's so good.

02:26:05.677 --> 02:26:08.898
[SPEAKER_05]: I gotta say, Starkiller was awesome though in that game.

02:26:09.118 --> 02:26:09.618
[SPEAKER_05]: He was OP.

02:26:09.679 --> 02:26:11.119
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a nice looking gentleman.

02:26:11.299 --> 02:26:12.600
[SPEAKER_05]: He's based off a real person, isn't he?

02:26:12.640 --> 02:26:15.821
[SPEAKER_05]: Sam Witwer, the actor, yeah, is Starkiller.

02:26:15.861 --> 02:26:19.783
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway... How often are you thinking about this guy?

02:26:22.251 --> 02:26:38.705
[SPEAKER_05]: Enzo from Assassin's Creed the last few Assassin's Creed games is in Soul Calibur 5 and it looks super badass and he fits in stylistically with everyone it was one of those things when they announced that I was like oh I didn't think of that

02:26:39.305 --> 02:26:43.387
[SPEAKER_05]: It's better than Kratos in Mortal Kombat, and even that was reasonable.

02:26:45.607 --> 02:26:48.729
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, Enzo is in Soul Calibur V, it's confirmed.

02:26:48.789 --> 02:26:50.109
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe there are screenshots.

02:26:50.889 --> 02:26:55.371
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's another little promotional tidbit that they've released for us.

02:26:55.911 --> 02:26:59.673
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a special pre-order bonus character named Dampir.

02:27:00.513 --> 02:27:03.634
[SPEAKER_05]: and he is very wacky and silly.

02:27:04.314 --> 02:27:17.919
[SPEAKER_05]: He's kind of a vaudeville circus MC with a hat and sort of like a villainous, the curly mustache that ties the damsel in distress on the railroad tracks.

02:27:19.019 --> 02:27:21.760
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's got striped pants and he's very nutty.

02:27:23.901 --> 02:27:28.943
[SPEAKER_05]: And you should watch the gameplay trailer of him doing his moves and it's like, this guy is nuts.

02:27:29.443 --> 02:27:31.305
[SPEAKER_05]: You get to make your own characters again, right?

02:27:31.685 --> 02:27:32.185
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe so.

02:27:32.205 --> 02:27:34.287
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I remember, was it Soul Calibur 3 or 4?

02:27:34.668 --> 02:27:35.488
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it was you, Loki.

02:27:35.508 --> 02:27:36.189
[SPEAKER_08]: It must have been 3.

02:27:36.409 --> 02:27:38.831
[SPEAKER_08]: It must have been back when we were living together when Soul Calibur 3 came out.

02:27:39.131 --> 02:27:42.614
[SPEAKER_08]: And you made that character named Benedict that looked like the Pope.

02:27:42.735 --> 02:27:43.155
[SPEAKER_08]: That wasn't me.

02:27:43.175 --> 02:27:43.795
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought that was.

02:27:44.036 --> 02:27:44.676
[SPEAKER_08]: Was that Extifer?

02:27:44.696 --> 02:27:45.597
[SPEAKER_08]: It must have been Extifer then.

02:27:46.178 --> 02:27:47.279
[SPEAKER_08]: Why did I think it was you, Loki?

02:27:47.819 --> 02:27:49.060
[SPEAKER_08]: I get you and Extifer confused.

02:27:49.080 --> 02:27:50.501
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know how that's even possible.

02:27:50.581 --> 02:27:50.862
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

02:27:52.623 --> 02:27:53.083
[SPEAKER_05]: Good times.

02:27:53.964 --> 02:27:59.987
[SPEAKER_05]: And he kind of reminds me of a silly character from Street Fighter 4 who I hate.

02:28:00.407 --> 02:28:03.048
[SPEAKER_05]: The big, giant, large guy.

02:28:03.088 --> 02:28:03.448
[SPEAKER_05]: Rufus.

02:28:03.608 --> 02:28:05.089
[SPEAKER_05]: Rufus with the balloon belly.

02:28:05.149 --> 02:28:06.090
[SPEAKER_05]: He's the American character.

02:28:06.390 --> 02:28:07.850
[SPEAKER_05]: This is just Capcom being silly.

02:28:08.211 --> 02:28:12.313
[SPEAKER_05]: This guy, to me, is that but done in a way that isn't totally stupid.

02:28:13.853 --> 02:28:17.315
[SPEAKER_08]: Rufus has fans, so Rufus is going to be in the Street Fighter X Tekken game.

02:28:18.851 --> 02:28:20.413
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that makes sense, I think.

02:28:21.094 --> 02:28:27.361
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so Enzo, awesome, and this weird, wacky circus vaudeville guy, Dampier, if you pre-order the game.

02:28:28.042 --> 02:28:31.826
[SPEAKER_05]: And that, when is, I think I had a release date here for when that game was coming out.

02:28:32.106 --> 02:28:32.727
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, next year.

02:28:33.007 --> 02:28:35.210
[SPEAKER_05]: January 31st, I want to say.

02:28:35.510 --> 02:28:36.732
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's near the beginning of the year.

02:28:36.872 --> 02:28:39.335
[SPEAKER_05]: Soul Calibur fans, rejoice.

02:28:40.175 --> 02:28:42.257
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll be buying that, just so you know.

02:28:42.437 --> 02:28:43.397
[SPEAKER_08]: I played the hell out of 4.

02:28:43.538 --> 02:28:46.319
[SPEAKER_08]: Soul Calibur is my favorite fighting game franchise, so that's going to be awesome.

02:28:46.680 --> 02:28:47.060
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't wait.

02:28:47.520 --> 02:28:49.902
[SPEAKER_08]: In fact, we should start playing Soul Calibur 4 again in anticipation.

02:28:50.322 --> 02:28:50.662
[SPEAKER_08]: I have it on 360.

02:28:51.643 --> 02:28:52.023
[SPEAKER_08]: Good times.

02:28:53.424 --> 02:28:54.705
[SPEAKER_07]: I never did buy Vader, though.

02:28:55.926 --> 02:28:59.008
[SPEAKER_07]: For modded consoles, they have a topless version.

02:28:59.548 --> 02:29:01.470
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, of course.

02:29:01.610 --> 02:29:04.052
[SPEAKER_08]: Ivy's like two pixels away from being topless.

02:29:04.392 --> 02:29:06.333
[SPEAKER_05]: I have Yoda and Vader on my 360 account, so...

02:29:08.402 --> 02:29:08.602
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.

02:29:08.822 --> 02:29:09.483
[SPEAKER_08]: Through me, you have it.

02:29:11.124 --> 02:29:13.405
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, a couple more stories for you guys, then we'll get to the Twitters.

02:29:15.246 --> 02:29:15.506
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki.

02:29:16.227 --> 02:29:34.017
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's a lot of high-concept stuff that Microsoft's doing, especially since they just had the Sesame Street Once Upon a Monster game come out on Xbox 360 for Kinect just last week.

02:29:34.798 --> 02:29:40.164
[SPEAKER_06]: And so now they're kind of showing what they could possibly do for new things.

02:29:40.445 --> 02:29:45.411
[SPEAKER_06]: So next year, they're talking already, there's going to be a game called Pixar's Rush.

02:29:46.432 --> 02:29:48.155
[SPEAKER_06]: And what this will allow you to do is...

02:29:50.217 --> 02:29:53.258
[SPEAKER_06]: And then of course, going with that, they're going to also do Connect Sesame Street TV Which is...

02:30:12.182 --> 02:30:12.803
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of neat.

02:30:12.863 --> 02:30:21.471
[SPEAKER_06]: What it is, is it's going to be something that you watch actual TV shows, or almost like episodes, and you can interact with them using Kinect.

02:30:21.972 --> 02:30:30.260
[SPEAKER_06]: So they showed one that showed kind of an almost live-action feed of Grover or whatever trying to... Can I choke Elmo?

02:30:31.301 --> 02:30:32.022
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know about that.

02:30:32.901 --> 02:30:34.062
[SPEAKER_06]: Connect National Geographic TV

02:30:48.909 --> 02:31:09.847
[SPEAKER_06]: and with that you can know they have like people going okay you know who can spot you know whatever so you're like you know kind of have like a punch card almost that you're okay I see a moose and you know whoever shouts it out first you'll get the point and that kind of stuff or you can ask about more information on certain things it's like interactive TV oh that's

02:31:10.347 --> 02:31:12.911
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of neat, if it works.

02:31:13.071 --> 02:31:15.975
[SPEAKER_08]: That makes the Kinect very useful, actually.

02:31:16.135 --> 02:31:21.622
[SPEAKER_06]: That, to me, seems like something that would be more useful for their TV service.

02:31:22.603 --> 02:31:28.151
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially since I would hope that something like that would be kind of free since PBS is free for the most part.

02:31:29.696 --> 02:31:32.678
[SPEAKER_06]: So that'd be kind of cool if they had Sesame Street and stuff.

02:31:32.698 --> 02:31:33.999
[SPEAKER_06]: You could download episodes.

02:31:34.820 --> 02:31:36.421
[SPEAKER_08]: Why can't they do this with adult shows?

02:31:37.082 --> 02:31:39.364
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, can I vote for American Idol through my Kinect?

02:31:39.824 --> 02:31:40.525
[SPEAKER_08]: That'd be kind of cool.

02:31:42.246 --> 02:31:45.429
[SPEAKER_08]: Or yell, fuck this guy, and it'll be a negative vote or something.

02:31:46.330 --> 02:31:46.530
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe.

02:31:48.494 --> 02:32:09.806
[SPEAKER_08]: um going to our chat room the chat is a little bit behind because the live delay they're commenting on the Soul Calibur story a little bit here um HitStun wanted to throw out there that Dom Pierre debuted in Soul Calibur 4 PSP I guess sometimes the Soul Calibur series kind of does these previews uh HitStun says just like Amy's moveset debuted in Soul Calibur 3 Arcade Edition before showing up in Soul Calibur 4 so sometimes you get a little sneak peek

02:32:10.826 --> 02:32:12.788
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't play the Soul Calibur PSP.

02:32:13.608 --> 02:32:14.029
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know why.

02:32:14.069 --> 02:32:15.410
[SPEAKER_08]: I just didn't think it would transfer very well.

02:32:15.430 --> 02:32:16.951
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like an action RPG, I think, right?

02:32:16.991 --> 02:32:19.252
[SPEAKER_05]: Where it's fighting matches, but also a story mode.

02:32:19.593 --> 02:32:21.234
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's a lot more fighting.

02:32:21.654 --> 02:32:23.636
[SPEAKER_08]: And I believe, if I'm not mistaken, Kratos was on that.

02:32:24.496 --> 02:32:24.676
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

02:32:25.217 --> 02:32:25.597
[SPEAKER_08]: Funny enough.

02:32:26.037 --> 02:32:27.198
[SPEAKER_08]: Kratos is in everything!

02:32:27.378 --> 02:32:29.900
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, what'll he be in next?

02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:30.621
[SPEAKER_08]: Angry Birds?

02:32:32.153 --> 02:32:38.817
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, last but not least tonight before we get to the Skype line is a story about toilet gaming.

02:32:39.397 --> 02:32:43.639
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, we've heard about this before, but no, seriously, it's like going on to the next level now.

02:32:44.040 --> 02:32:48.922
[SPEAKER_08]: Sega Toys is making these toilets where you can actually game with pee.

02:32:49.262 --> 02:32:52.925
[SPEAKER_08]: There's all sorts of mini-games, like erasing graffiti with a hose.

02:32:53.445 --> 02:32:54.846
[SPEAKER_08]: You can guess what the hose is.

02:32:55.586 --> 02:32:58.348
[SPEAKER_08]: You can use wind to blow under a woman's skirt.

02:32:58.448 --> 02:32:59.908
[SPEAKER_08]: Somehow your pee is wind.

02:33:00.369 --> 02:33:00.709
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

02:33:01.709 --> 02:33:03.531
[SPEAKER_08]: And do I even want to read this?

02:33:05.292 --> 02:33:08.134
[SPEAKER_08]: A Bukkake battle where you shoot milk from your nose.

02:33:08.994 --> 02:33:09.495
[SPEAKER_05]: No!

02:33:12.577 --> 02:33:17.920
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, in fact, you can actually see some pictures here at mycom.co.jp.

02:33:18.301 --> 02:33:19.722
[SPEAKER_08]: You can actually see pictures of the...

02:33:21.044 --> 02:33:23.606
[SPEAKER_08]: Little urinals here with the little TV monitors in them.

02:33:23.646 --> 02:33:24.226
[SPEAKER_08]: See, look at that.

02:33:24.987 --> 02:33:26.168
[SPEAKER_08]: See, that creeps me out, though.

02:33:26.508 --> 02:33:28.369
[SPEAKER_08]: Doesn't that look like a little webcam at the top?

02:33:28.469 --> 02:33:33.112
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, who knows what images are being transmitted to Sega headquarters on that thing?

02:33:33.172 --> 02:33:34.633
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, you sick pervos.

02:33:34.974 --> 02:33:49.284
[SPEAKER_05]: And for this screenshot here with the little angry cloud of wind that's trying to blow up the girl's dress so that we can, you know, see her underwear, I'm just thinking of some dude totally dunking his ass over this thing and letting one rip and then sharting.

02:33:49.884 --> 02:33:56.907
[SPEAKER_05]: and it's like, dear Sega, your game made me shit my pants and I'm very upset that the little fart cloud panty game made me do this.

02:33:59.848 --> 02:34:00.288
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

02:34:00.428 --> 02:34:06.470
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you have to insert a quarter to make this work or is it just like, are we going back to pay toilets or what's the deal?

02:34:06.610 --> 02:34:08.351
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you gotta insert something.

02:34:08.791 --> 02:34:09.271
[SPEAKER_06]: Stop.

02:34:11.674 --> 02:34:17.778
[SPEAKER_05]: Just think of, you know, people drunk, they can't aim, you work in an arcade, you're like, I'm not cleaning this up.

02:34:17.798 --> 02:34:19.538
[SPEAKER_08]: This would be a hilarious thing to have at a bar.

02:34:20.779 --> 02:34:26.122
[SPEAKER_08]: But let's just all form a prayer circle right now and hope that this never shows up in the US.

02:34:27.482 --> 02:34:28.423
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's just bow our heads.

02:34:31.522 --> 02:34:33.182
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, we're going to open up the Skype line.

02:34:33.222 --> 02:34:33.883
[SPEAKER_08]: It's about time.

02:34:33.903 --> 02:34:37.964
[SPEAKER_08]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

02:34:37.984 --> 02:34:44.065
[SPEAKER_08]: We will take your calls about anything you want to talk about tonight, whether it be a story that we've talked about or something that maybe we didn't get to.

02:34:44.565 --> 02:34:48.506
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe you want to talk about how you've had yourself barricaded in your room all week playing Arkham City.

02:34:48.546 --> 02:34:50.767
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd love to hear about it because sadly none of us did that.

02:34:51.667 --> 02:34:53.069
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

02:34:53.089 --> 02:34:57.173
[SPEAKER_08]: 1877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

02:34:57.313 --> 02:34:58.795
[SPEAKER_08]: It is a toll-free number in the U.S.

02:34:58.835 --> 02:35:00.917
[SPEAKER_08]: and Canada, but I can't speak for other countries.

02:35:01.037 --> 02:35:03.499
[SPEAKER_08]: I would suggest if you're in another country, you get Skype for free.

02:35:03.680 --> 02:35:06.302
[SPEAKER_08]: Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

02:35:07.063 --> 02:35:09.626
[SPEAKER_08]: Meanwhile, while we wait for calls, we're going to go to the Twitters.

02:35:11.156 --> 02:35:18.278
[SPEAKER_08]: Dark Tetsuya tweets us, if the DDR freak thing doesn't wind up happening, we should totally organize a tournament of some sort for our 10th next year.

02:35:18.838 --> 02:35:20.778
[SPEAKER_08]: That's kind of what I want to do anyway.

02:35:20.818 --> 02:35:32.001
[SPEAKER_08]: In fact, I've kind of put DarkSakura in charge of putting the 10th thing together because she knows people that do stuff at places that we want to be involved with.

02:35:32.081 --> 02:35:33.441
[SPEAKER_08]: And I can't say much more than that.

02:35:33.481 --> 02:35:35.322
[SPEAKER_08]: But we are trying to make the 10th a big deal.

02:35:35.362 --> 02:35:39.583
[SPEAKER_08]: But I want to warn you guys, it may not be on the exact anniversary of the show.

02:35:40.183 --> 02:35:41.304
[SPEAKER_08]: Death Wishings Dave Gruelkahn

02:36:00.988 --> 02:36:04.270
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not going to pay $130 to play demos of betas.

02:36:04.330 --> 02:36:05.892
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to sell my soul to Blizzard to get in.

02:36:05.912 --> 02:36:08.273
[SPEAKER_04]: But you can see all those cool pandas.

02:36:08.373 --> 02:36:11.496
[SPEAKER_08]: I can see all that cool shit on DirecTV, and I've got this thing called the internet.

02:36:11.516 --> 02:36:15.959
[SPEAKER_04]: But pandas, Panda Continent, Panda Class, Panda Games, and Pokemon.

02:36:15.979 --> 02:36:17.240
[SPEAKER_04]: Panda, fuck off.

02:36:17.580 --> 02:36:18.420
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't care.

02:36:20.422 --> 02:36:24.685
[SPEAKER_04]: So actually, I want to talk to Loki about Grand Theft Auto mods.

02:36:24.765 --> 02:36:25.746
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, that'll cost a dollar.

02:36:26.522 --> 02:36:27.323
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting mod.

02:36:27.763 --> 02:36:29.344
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you heard of that ice?

02:36:29.524 --> 02:36:31.626
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's like icy enhancer.

02:36:33.027 --> 02:36:37.049
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's EMB stuff.

02:36:37.150 --> 02:36:39.891
[SPEAKER_04]: It does like a crazy texture, like mods and all that.

02:36:39.911 --> 02:36:43.214
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes the game look just like ungodly beautiful.

02:36:44.174 --> 02:36:46.896
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, a lot of the EMB stuff looks pretty good.

02:36:47.717 --> 02:36:48.918
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, do you use it?

02:36:49.098 --> 02:36:49.698
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you run it?

02:36:49.718 --> 02:36:52.921
[SPEAKER_04]: Because me and my friend were worried that he wants to install it.

02:36:53.732 --> 02:36:55.514
[SPEAKER_04]: But he's afraid that he can't run it.

02:36:56.616 --> 02:36:58.098
[SPEAKER_04]: Because he doesn't have a core i7.

02:36:58.458 --> 02:36:59.039
[SPEAKER_04]: I think he only has an i3.

02:37:02.028 --> 02:37:02.468
[SPEAKER_06]: Caramageddon mod.

02:37:29.813 --> 02:37:31.094
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:38:00.346 --> 02:38:02.267
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm whatever about the panda thing.

02:38:02.307 --> 02:38:08.070
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's a little silly that they're bifactional, but I think it'll be good in the long run.

02:38:08.151 --> 02:38:09.712
[SPEAKER_08]: I love the art style.

02:38:09.752 --> 02:38:16.636
[SPEAKER_08]: Even though I'm meh on the pandas, I would have been 100% totally okay with this had the pandaren been NPCs.

02:38:16.716 --> 02:38:17.997
[SPEAKER_08]: I kind of think they should have stayed.

02:38:18.697 --> 02:38:21.060
[SPEAKER_08]: I would have rather seen the Tuskar be playable.

02:38:21.320 --> 02:38:23.222
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, of course, I just want a Tuskar named Diabetes.

02:38:23.762 --> 02:38:30.549
[SPEAKER_08]: But the Tuskar or the Tonka, what are the Tauren-like people called?

02:38:30.689 --> 02:38:31.269
[SPEAKER_05]: The Bison.

02:38:31.449 --> 02:38:33.111
[SPEAKER_05]: They're Tonka, yeah.

02:38:33.191 --> 02:38:34.512
[SPEAKER_08]: They could have been a great playable class.

02:38:34.572 --> 02:38:37.075
[SPEAKER_08]: The Naga, everybody thinks is inevitable at some point.

02:38:37.375 --> 02:38:39.197
[SPEAKER_08]: It just seems like there's a lot of other stuff they could have chosen from.

02:38:39.217 --> 02:38:40.378
[SPEAKER_08]: But fine, they went cute.

02:38:40.686 --> 02:38:41.787
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I understand.

02:38:41.807 --> 02:38:45.088
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess pandas allegedly are a part of the lore, my friend said.

02:38:45.268 --> 02:38:47.229
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but they're always joke lore.

02:38:47.449 --> 02:38:57.775
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, but it's like, honestly, I mean, every update I've seen, and wow, the ones that have added big segments were, this is part of the segment, and then there's all this shit to do.

02:38:57.835 --> 02:39:01.497
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it was like, Cataclysm, oh, it changes the map, but there's all this shit to do.

02:39:01.517 --> 02:39:05.499
[SPEAKER_04]: And then this one's just like, fucking pandas everywhere.

02:39:05.579 --> 02:39:06.039
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at this.

02:39:06.059 --> 02:39:06.879
[SPEAKER_04]: We're so cool.

02:39:06.959 --> 02:39:07.660
[SPEAKER_04]: Weeaboo now.

02:39:09.028 --> 02:39:10.229
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, look, here's the thing, though.

02:39:10.249 --> 02:39:13.231
[SPEAKER_08]: At the end of the day, I probably will not be rolling a panda monk.

02:39:13.851 --> 02:39:17.334
[SPEAKER_08]: I will have to roll a gnome monk, because that's going to be awesome, because gnomes are hilarious.

02:39:17.354 --> 02:39:18.174
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you can be a gnome monk?

02:39:18.294 --> 02:39:19.875
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought only pandas could be monks.

02:39:19.935 --> 02:39:25.559
[SPEAKER_08]: No, anybody can be monks, except, funny enough, Worgen and Goblin, who were the additions in the last expansion.

02:39:26.200 --> 02:39:31.103
[SPEAKER_04]: Every other race in the game can be... I'm just waiting to see a bunch of pandas with a variation of the name Jack Black.

02:39:31.463 --> 02:39:32.184
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I know, right?

02:39:32.364 --> 02:39:33.164
[SPEAKER_08]: Reserve the names now.

02:39:34.385 --> 02:39:38.548
[SPEAKER_08]: Salacious Pop told a funny joke on Horde House about... What was it you said about female pandarins?

02:39:39.693 --> 02:39:45.775
[SPEAKER_05]: Their slash dance emote is they're just going to sit in a chair and move their hand around like Adele and roll in in the deep.

02:39:46.555 --> 02:39:47.556
[SPEAKER_05]: They're just going to sit in a chair.

02:39:47.856 --> 02:39:51.817
[SPEAKER_08]: I was trying to get a panda named Adele, but the name was already taken.

02:39:52.037 --> 02:39:53.158
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody beat us to it.

02:39:54.258 --> 02:40:05.562
[SPEAKER_08]: But here's the thing, Deathwishing, and I kind of said this at the top of the show, but I'm more excited about the fact that they're giving players at level 90 so much more to do than just dungeon, raiding, and PvP.

02:40:05.842 --> 02:40:07.363
[SPEAKER_08]: Which is already a lot as it is, but now...

02:40:08.903 --> 02:40:10.724
[SPEAKER_08]: Pokemon, believe it or not, it's a thing.

02:40:10.965 --> 02:40:11.885
[SPEAKER_08]: People will be into it.

02:40:12.546 --> 02:40:15.127
[SPEAKER_08]: Challenge Dungeons, I'm really excited about Challenge Dungeons.

02:40:15.147 --> 02:40:18.790
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they're just scared because of the older public.

02:40:18.810 --> 02:40:19.570
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course they are.

02:40:21.031 --> 02:40:23.353
[SPEAKER_04]: I stopped playing EVE Online just because of that.

02:40:23.893 --> 02:40:24.834
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to be playing that.

02:40:25.034 --> 02:40:25.735
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's the thing.

02:40:26.575 --> 02:40:28.537
[SPEAKER_08]: I have no doubt that the game will be good.

02:40:28.797 --> 02:40:32.019
[SPEAKER_08]: However, we have gone through this how many times?

02:40:32.657 --> 02:40:34.258
[SPEAKER_08]: Age of Conan was going to be the killer.

02:40:34.398 --> 02:40:36.519
[SPEAKER_08]: Then EverQuest 2, and then Warhammer.

02:40:36.539 --> 02:40:37.700
[SPEAKER_04]: But you don't understand, man.

02:40:37.860 --> 02:40:38.941
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Star Wars.

02:40:39.401 --> 02:40:40.081
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, I know.

02:40:40.902 --> 02:40:47.365
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm telling you, all the people from Star Wars Galaxies will play it because of the remorse of Star Wars Galaxy shutting down.

02:40:48.426 --> 02:40:51.207
[SPEAKER_04]: They may not like it, but they'll just cry themselves while playing it.

02:40:51.788 --> 02:40:52.628
[SPEAKER_04]: I miss you.

02:40:54.969 --> 02:40:55.710
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I can say.

02:40:57.339 --> 02:40:59.880
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously, Blizzard is going to lose some people to Star Wars.

02:41:00.020 --> 02:41:03.402
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why they've come up with this whole annual pass thing to lock you in anyway.

02:41:03.522 --> 02:41:08.905
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's no... I mean, I heard that buying a year pass now, you can get Diablo 3 for free.

02:41:08.925 --> 02:41:10.186
[SPEAKER_04]: That's from what I heard.

02:41:11.347 --> 02:41:15.029
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's just kind of solidifying that Activision Blizzard has too much money.

02:41:16.414 --> 02:41:19.355
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll give you the game that we know we're going to make shitloads of money on for free.

02:41:19.635 --> 02:41:20.215
[SPEAKER_04]: Not really.

02:41:20.315 --> 02:41:21.435
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we have too much money.

02:41:21.775 --> 02:41:22.016
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.

02:41:22.036 --> 02:41:23.876
[SPEAKER_08]: They're going to make money on Diablo anyway.

02:41:24.016 --> 02:41:30.938
[SPEAKER_08]: And like I said earlier, if you're contracted for a year of WoW, you pretty much are guaranteed to get Mists of Pandaria, which they're not giving you for free.

02:41:32.718 --> 02:41:33.599
[SPEAKER_08]: Mists of Pandaria.

02:41:34.519 --> 02:41:34.839
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

02:41:34.919 --> 02:41:38.040
[SPEAKER_08]: Any other BlizzCon or what have you thoughts before we let you go, buddy?

02:41:40.692 --> 02:41:43.294
[SPEAKER_04]: Did anything cool happen with the whole Foo Fighters thing?

02:41:43.334 --> 02:41:45.216
[SPEAKER_04]: Any reports on that, or was it just Foo Fighters?

02:41:45.236 --> 02:41:47.218
[SPEAKER_08]: Dave Grohl played the guitar in the audience, that's what I heard.

02:41:47.819 --> 02:41:50.642
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay, so I already seen that live.

02:41:50.882 --> 02:41:51.623
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, cool.

02:41:51.763 --> 02:41:52.644
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, cool story, bro.

02:41:52.664 --> 02:41:53.264
[SPEAKER_04]: Take care, buddy.

02:41:57.170 --> 02:42:05.257
[SPEAKER_05]: I still want the WoW expansion Myths of Panera Bread so I can get a turkey feta panini with side salad.

02:42:05.377 --> 02:42:08.019
[SPEAKER_08]: Kaijudo in chat says, back off Adele, she's hot.

02:42:08.079 --> 02:42:09.381
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, I never said she wasn't hot.

02:42:10.021 --> 02:42:14.425
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody's into whatever, but I'm sorry, it's just the joke was too good.

02:42:15.646 --> 02:42:16.046
[SPEAKER_08]: Had to be there.

02:42:16.407 --> 02:42:16.647
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

02:42:17.247 --> 02:42:17.548
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

02:42:17.568 --> 02:42:18.548
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving on with some more tweets.

02:42:19.149 --> 02:42:22.551
[SPEAKER_08]: MNZiba tweets us saying, Loki, is this what you do when you play Grand Theft Auto?

02:42:22.671 --> 02:42:27.255
[SPEAKER_08]: Usually I don't click on YouTubes that I don't know what they are, but I'm going to take a chance on this one.

02:42:27.295 --> 02:42:27.735
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

02:42:29.256 --> 02:42:29.877
[SPEAKER_08]: That's funny.

02:42:41.843 --> 02:42:43.985
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks like Night Nito is just throwing cars around.

02:42:44.866 --> 02:42:46.247
[SPEAKER_06]: It is very hard to play that.

02:42:46.808 --> 02:42:54.595
[SPEAKER_06]: I once contemplated doing that as part of the mod, but I was quickly vetoed on that because they're like, uh, yeah.

02:42:54.615 --> 02:42:57.378
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're trying to do the campaign stuff, or is this for Deathmatch?

02:42:57.398 --> 02:42:58.279
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, are you trying to run around?

02:42:58.319 --> 02:42:59.800
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait, I gotta take this call.

02:42:59.840 --> 02:43:00.941
[SPEAKER_08]: It's very appropriate of the time.

02:43:01.101 --> 02:43:02.102
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, you're on Warner Sounds Radio.

02:43:02.122 --> 02:43:02.482
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's this?

02:43:03.203 --> 02:43:20.756
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, this is Ziba Ziba, we're watching this video, I am cracking the hell up at this Grand Theft Auto stuff, this is great Yeah, I found that on my Twitter, I was like, oh god, I just thought of Loki just right when I watched it And I love that they used the Benny Hill theme, A+, thumbs up Thanks So what's on your mind tonight, Ziba?

02:43:21.777 --> 02:43:25.940
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I just want to let you know, you jinxed my iPhone Oh shit, what did I do?

02:43:27.962 --> 02:43:33.745
[SPEAKER_02]: A couple days later that you announced that your iPhone's power button went, mine went.

02:43:34.485 --> 02:43:35.285
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, no.

02:43:35.606 --> 02:43:36.046
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

02:43:36.186 --> 02:43:37.286
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it the sleep button?

02:43:37.526 --> 02:43:38.667
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, the sleep button.

02:43:38.687 --> 02:43:41.208
[SPEAKER_02]: The sleep power button, whatever you want to call it on the top.

02:43:41.808 --> 02:43:42.729
[SPEAKER_02]: They're faulty.

02:43:43.109 --> 02:43:44.149
[SPEAKER_02]: I want a refund.

02:43:44.530 --> 02:43:45.370
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm suing Apple.

02:43:45.390 --> 02:43:45.850
[SPEAKER_02]: Class action.

02:43:45.950 --> 02:43:47.371
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm suing Steve Jobs.

02:43:47.771 --> 02:43:48.491
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait, can't do that.

02:43:48.571 --> 02:43:49.892
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm suing Tim Cook.

02:43:50.472 --> 02:43:51.893
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm suing everybody.

02:43:53.140 --> 02:43:58.726
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thank God that my iPhone is not a year old yet, so I still had warranty.

02:43:58.786 --> 02:44:00.628
[SPEAKER_02]: So they were able to give me a whole new phone.

02:44:01.049 --> 02:44:01.569
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.

02:44:01.870 --> 02:44:02.450
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what's funny?

02:44:02.490 --> 02:44:10.579
[SPEAKER_08]: My very first iPhone 4, the little ringer button, the little thing on the side next to the volume that turns the ringer on and off, that was broken.

02:44:11.320 --> 02:44:39.920
[SPEAKER_08]: but that was like day one a break so they gave me a new phone for free but it was still I had to re-sync everything I'm gonna get a new phone but probably in January and I've got to decide between now and then if I'm just gonna say you know what forget the iPhone I'm done with it and go to the iPad or if I'm gonna get suckered in and buy the iPhone 4S anyway of which everybody's just raving about Siri oh I love Siri I love Siri so how are you liking your iPhone though otherwise do you do any gaming on it

02:44:40.498 --> 02:44:41.399
[SPEAKER_02]: I have some games.

02:44:41.519 --> 02:44:50.985
[SPEAKER_02]: I have like Secret of Mana and Final Fantasy Tactics and Katamari Damacy and Infinity Blade.

02:44:51.986 --> 02:44:53.827
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it just me or do a lot of them play like poop?

02:44:54.850 --> 02:44:58.472
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, especially Secret of Mana is really hard to move around.

02:44:58.712 --> 02:44:59.893
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's unfortunate.

02:45:00.113 --> 02:45:03.315
[SPEAKER_02]: They made it a little better, but it still is pretty hard.

02:45:03.855 --> 02:45:16.902
[SPEAKER_08]: I will say though, the Final Fantasy 3 remake, it's probably still like 15 bucks, which is like 15 times as much what most games cost, but it's actually done really well and it's easy to control.

02:45:17.142 --> 02:45:22.545
[SPEAKER_08]: So I gotta say the Final Fantasy 3 remake from the DS is really good on iPhone.

02:45:23.866 --> 02:45:38.335
[SPEAKER_08]: or iPad whatever it is you're gonna game on out there in the audience so I did have the DS version so I'm not really into you know getting it on my phone yeah you don't need to buy the same thing twice that's true no so what else have you been playing any any console or PC games

02:45:39.187 --> 02:45:40.588
[SPEAKER_02]: I did get a new DS game.

02:45:40.928 --> 02:45:42.649
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't really pronounce the name.

02:45:42.709 --> 02:45:46.311
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like Sola del Robo, The Red Hunter.

02:45:46.611 --> 02:45:46.871
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

02:45:47.271 --> 02:45:49.913
[SPEAKER_02]: What's this game about?

02:45:49.973 --> 02:45:52.394
[SPEAKER_02]: All the furries are getting it, but that's not why I got it.

02:45:54.255 --> 02:45:54.875
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's...

02:45:56.076 --> 02:46:10.752
[SPEAKER_02]: I just kind of just started playing it, so I really don't know too much about the story, but you are this fox, and you're just trying to save the world, but I really don't know too much about the story, like I said, I have to keep going at it, but I like it so far.

02:46:12.034 --> 02:46:13.816
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice, and why are the furries into it?

02:46:14.980 --> 02:46:19.385
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's all anthropomorphic characters in it.

02:46:21.346 --> 02:46:22.207
[SPEAKER_08]: That sounds like fun.

02:46:23.208 --> 02:46:25.751
[SPEAKER_08]: Salacious Pop, did I see your eyes just perk up a little bit?

02:46:25.891 --> 02:46:26.171
[SPEAKER_08]: Yiff.

02:46:28.313 --> 02:46:28.773
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, God.

02:46:28.793 --> 02:46:29.494
[SPEAKER_08]: Please don't go there.

02:46:30.455 --> 02:46:31.035
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

02:46:32.136 --> 02:46:35.957
[SPEAKER_08]: Ziba, I hope you enjoy the game and enjoy your phone now that it works again.

02:46:36.097 --> 02:46:39.018
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm sorry to curse you, but I'm really happy that... Oh, I'm really just joking.

02:46:39.358 --> 02:46:42.399
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, I know, but I'm glad you at least got a replacement for free.

02:46:43.059 --> 02:46:48.601
[SPEAKER_08]: To be fair, I still need to take mine to the store and see if there's anything they can do with it, but I don't have my hopes up because I didn't buy AppleCare.

02:46:50.781 --> 02:46:52.222
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, well, Ziba, I'm going to let you go, okay?

02:46:52.743 --> 02:46:53.183
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, thank you.

02:46:53.203 --> 02:46:53.663
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, take care.

02:46:53.683 --> 02:46:55.124
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for calling in, and thanks again for the video.

02:46:55.765 --> 02:46:56.285
[SPEAKER_02]: No problem.

02:46:56.345 --> 02:46:56.565
[SPEAKER_08]: Later.

02:46:56.585 --> 02:47:00.928
[SPEAKER_08]: 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

02:47:01.248 --> 02:47:05.551
[SPEAKER_08]: Going to some other tweets, Zether77 tweets us saying, You guys may want to see this.

02:47:05.612 --> 02:47:09.234
[SPEAKER_08]: It's probably going to be the pinball video game to end all pinball video games.

02:47:09.654 --> 02:47:16.319
[SPEAKER_08]: And gives this cheap plug for Pinball Arcade, which I guess is for the phones and so forth.

02:47:16.872 --> 02:47:19.073
[SPEAKER_08]: This is like something you're working on or something.

02:47:19.153 --> 02:47:19.553
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

02:47:21.233 --> 02:47:22.734
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh shit, it has Arabian Nights.

02:47:22.794 --> 02:47:23.194
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm there.

02:47:24.695 --> 02:47:25.975
[SPEAKER_08]: Fucking love the Arabian Nights table.

02:47:26.215 --> 02:47:30.557
[SPEAKER_09]: Isn't this just... I feel like Emilia.

02:47:30.677 --> 02:47:35.118
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, it looks like they have an arrangement with various pinball table folks.

02:47:35.678 --> 02:47:39.019
[SPEAKER_08]: There's Black Hole because it's got Bally's Stern.

02:47:39.220 --> 02:47:40.640
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god, Theater of Magic.

02:47:40.700 --> 02:47:41.260
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm so in.

02:47:41.540 --> 02:47:42.921
[SPEAKER_08]: This is like the best table ever.

02:47:44.401 --> 02:47:44.841
[SPEAKER_08]: You remember this?

02:47:44.881 --> 02:47:45.542
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you ever play that?

02:47:45.722 --> 02:47:45.922
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

02:47:46.202 --> 02:47:46.322
Oh.

02:47:48.021 --> 02:47:48.922
[SPEAKER_08]: Red Dead Redemption on Kinect?

02:47:48.962 --> 02:47:49.002
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

02:48:06.963 --> 02:48:11.246
[SPEAKER_08]: I think Red Dead Redemption on Kinect would not be as good as just Red Dead Redemption.

02:48:12.127 --> 02:48:12.407
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

02:48:12.447 --> 02:48:17.271
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think people should feel forced to pigeonhole an existing game into the Kinect.

02:48:17.311 --> 02:48:19.112
[SPEAKER_08]: That Fable game really has me worried.

02:48:19.312 --> 02:48:21.054
[SPEAKER_06]: What are you talking about?

02:48:21.134 --> 02:48:21.914
[SPEAKER_06]: It has you worried?

02:48:23.297 --> 02:48:26.221
[SPEAKER_06]: It's gonna suck, like all the other ones have sucked.

02:48:27.002 --> 02:48:27.342
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.

02:48:27.402 --> 02:48:30.466
[SPEAKER_06]: Because Peter Molyneux is full of crap.

02:48:30.526 --> 02:48:31.927
[SPEAKER_08]: But he's new and cutting edge.

02:48:31.987 --> 02:48:33.349
[SPEAKER_06]: No, he's not new and cutting edge.

02:48:33.369 --> 02:48:34.050
[SPEAKER_06]: He's stupid.

02:48:34.190 --> 02:48:35.912
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, ah!

02:48:35.992 --> 02:48:37.634
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, Zaku, welcome to the show.

02:48:37.995 --> 02:48:38.635
[SPEAKER_08]: What's on your mind, buddy?

02:48:39.536 --> 02:48:40.277
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, nothing much.

02:48:40.357 --> 02:48:42.320
[SPEAKER_01]: Just trying to, like, absorb all the...

02:48:42.796 --> 02:48:45.077
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:49:06.989 --> 02:49:08.330
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I didn't realize it was that soon.

02:49:08.370 --> 02:49:09.451
[SPEAKER_08]: It's this Tuesday, huh?

02:49:09.471 --> 02:49:10.713
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

02:49:11.653 --> 02:49:17.479
[SPEAKER_01]: Because of work and everything, I didn't have the time to start speccing on a new computer, so I'm going to have to play catch-up.

02:49:17.699 --> 02:49:19.401
[SPEAKER_08]: You've called in to talk about this game before.

02:49:19.421 --> 02:49:21.723
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you excited about this?

02:49:22.223 --> 02:49:22.463
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

02:49:22.884 --> 02:49:30.811
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've seen footage of the beta so far, and it's pretty much a lot better than Bad Company 2, at the very least.

02:49:31.372 --> 02:49:32.052
[SPEAKER_01]: More importantly...

02:49:32.913 --> 02:49:38.578
[SPEAKER_01]: It does step it up as being the most realistic first-person shooter this year.

02:49:38.858 --> 02:49:42.001
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you decide to go PC, Xbox?

02:49:42.061 --> 02:49:42.442
[SPEAKER_01]: PC.

02:49:43.182 --> 02:49:46.745
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do you think I just said that I'm trying to spec out a new PC for you?

02:49:46.865 --> 02:49:47.326
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, derp.

02:49:47.446 --> 02:49:47.726
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

02:49:48.147 --> 02:49:49.288
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't listen very well.

02:49:49.368 --> 02:49:49.748
[SPEAKER_08]: My bad.

02:49:49.768 --> 02:49:52.971
[SPEAKER_08]: Doesn't that suck, though, that you have to upgrade your PC to play?

02:49:52.991 --> 02:49:55.993
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've already made my decision between that and Modern Warfare 3.

02:49:56.394 --> 02:49:58.195
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, at this point, it's like...

02:49:59.204 --> 02:50:03.386
[SPEAKER_01]: Even with Modern Warfare 3, even the fact they have dedicated servers, they're only for unranked.

02:50:03.906 --> 02:50:10.868
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, if I wanted to level up in that game, I would have to put up with the peer-to-peer crap, which is not good on the PC.

02:50:10.908 --> 02:50:12.049
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a horrible experience.

02:50:12.089 --> 02:50:13.329
[SPEAKER_01]: It's only meant for consoles.

02:50:13.829 --> 02:50:20.772
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the way I see it is Activision giving us half... It's like going halfway instead of actually...

02:50:22.935 --> 02:50:36.050
[SPEAKER_08]: What about if you can set up these controlled, super easy environments where somebody could just have a server that's for nothing but ranking up quickly and it would kind of ruin things?

02:50:36.130 --> 02:50:37.391
[SPEAKER_08]: I can kind of see that side of it.

02:50:37.611 --> 02:50:38.332
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's the thing.

02:50:38.392 --> 02:50:41.816
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I played Modern Warfare on the...

02:50:44.022 --> 02:50:48.864
[SPEAKER_01]: Played on PC with the servers and I was able to rank up easily.

02:50:48.924 --> 02:50:51.845
[SPEAKER_01]: Then again, I have skill with the keyboard and mouse.

02:50:51.965 --> 02:50:55.226
[SPEAKER_01]: But the point is that it didn't really impact cheating as much.

02:50:55.806 --> 02:51:03.269
[SPEAKER_01]: Because either way, once they spotted you as a cheater, you automatically get kicked and banned from that server.

02:51:04.190 --> 02:51:05.510
[SPEAKER_01]: Punkbuster works pretty well.

02:51:06.491 --> 02:51:07.371
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a pretty good hammer.

02:51:08.131 --> 02:51:10.192
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but is leveling up quickly cheating?

02:51:11.195 --> 02:51:18.599
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, cheating in the sense of when they find people hacking or cheating in that particular server, the admins boot them really fast.

02:51:19.660 --> 02:51:31.627
[SPEAKER_01]: But I could see why Activision is trying to release their half-baked solution for the lack of any servers in Modern Warfare 2.

02:51:32.688 --> 02:51:34.088
[SPEAKER_01]: They still want to push Elite.

02:51:35.629 --> 02:51:36.610
[SPEAKER_01]: That whole elite thing.

02:51:37.210 --> 02:51:45.977
[SPEAKER_01]: And the fact that having a dedicated server ranked, they believe that they will probably game the system that way.

02:51:47.218 --> 02:51:55.324
[SPEAKER_01]: You have folks that find exploits that aren't really patched, or more importantly, you set up a server just for the sake of ranking really fast.

02:51:55.464 --> 02:52:03.190
[SPEAKER_01]: I know Team Fortress 2 had this issue back in the day where it's just people idling in order to get unlocks.

02:52:06.281 --> 02:52:07.882
[SPEAKER_01]: I could see why they did that.

02:52:07.922 --> 02:52:18.652
[SPEAKER_01]: Battlefield 3 has dedicated servers, but it's almost like Bad Company 2 where everything's going to be from third-party providers.

02:52:19.212 --> 02:52:20.994
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's still a good solution, though.

02:52:23.004 --> 02:52:28.048
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I mean, at the end of the day, you're going to buy both games no matter what, right?

02:52:28.468 --> 02:52:30.369
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm probably going to just stick with Battlefield 3.

02:52:30.409 --> 02:52:31.770
[SPEAKER_01]: I've already made my decision.

02:52:31.910 --> 02:52:36.053
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to touch Modern Warfare 3 unless I can pick it up for dirt cheap.

02:52:36.173 --> 02:52:40.036
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, I'm just going to stick with Battlefield 3.

02:52:40.276 --> 02:52:45.380
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's not on Steam and I'm going to have to bite the bullet and give Origin a shot.

02:52:46.018 --> 02:52:49.020
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, props to you sticking by your guns and voting with your dollars.

02:52:49.380 --> 02:52:50.160
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what we always say.

02:52:50.181 --> 02:52:52.342
[SPEAKER_08]: If you feel strongly enough, vote with your dollars.

02:52:52.842 --> 02:52:57.585
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, Sakura, we're going to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but have fun and hopefully see you next week's show.

02:52:57.605 --> 02:52:58.866
[SPEAKER_08]: You're not too busy playing Battlefield.

02:52:59.546 --> 02:53:00.167
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's the thing.

02:53:00.207 --> 02:53:05.590
[SPEAKER_01]: If I can get a computer in a week, which I doubt, it's going to take a few more weeks for me to spec out everything.

02:53:06.490 --> 02:53:08.952
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, then we know when you disappear what happened.

02:53:09.712 --> 02:53:10.193
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

02:53:10.353 --> 02:53:11.133
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, take care, buddy.

02:53:11.693 --> 02:53:11.974
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

02:53:12.374 --> 02:53:12.574
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye.

02:53:14.247 --> 02:53:15.889
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, that's going to do it for Skype calls tonight.

02:53:15.929 --> 02:53:18.453
[SPEAKER_08]: For those that didn't get through, sorry, but try writing us an email.

02:53:18.513 --> 02:53:23.259
[SPEAKER_08]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com I want to quickly wrap up the rest of these tweets though, real quick.

02:53:23.740 --> 02:53:25.822
[SPEAKER_08]: Osfer tweets us saying a couple things.

02:53:26.663 --> 02:53:28.926
[SPEAKER_08]: First, I'm watching people play the new Spyro.

02:53:29.007 --> 02:53:31.430
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't look nearly as bad as Loki describes.

02:53:35.168 --> 02:53:40.630
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all about, not necessarily the gameplay, but the message behind it.

02:53:41.390 --> 02:53:42.271
[SPEAKER_06]: It sets precedent.

02:53:43.051 --> 02:53:46.513
[SPEAKER_08]: And Osfer also asks, random question for the staff.

02:53:46.893 --> 02:53:48.213
[SPEAKER_08]: Who is your favorite Pokemon?

02:53:48.413 --> 02:53:49.234
[SPEAKER_08]: Mine is Mewtwo.

02:53:50.874 --> 02:53:51.635
[SPEAKER_08]: I have an answer for this.

02:53:51.675 --> 02:53:53.856
[SPEAKER_08]: Does anyone else on staff have a way to answer for this?

02:53:53.896 --> 02:53:54.516
[SPEAKER_08]: Salacious Pop?

02:53:55.116 --> 02:53:57.157
[SPEAKER_08]: You watch or play Pokemon?

02:53:57.397 --> 02:53:57.777
[SPEAKER_08]: Bidoof.

02:53:58.358 --> 02:53:59.098
[SPEAKER_08]: What's Bidoof?

02:53:59.538 --> 02:54:00.679
[SPEAKER_08]: I've never heard of Bidoof.

02:54:00.939 --> 02:54:02.139
[SPEAKER_08]: How did you make that up?

02:54:02.199 --> 02:54:08.422
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to Google it, but he's the little squirrel that's stupid and he's like the worst Pokemon ever.

02:54:09.562 --> 02:54:11.684
[SPEAKER_08]: My favorite Pokemon by far is Jigglypuff.

02:54:12.304 --> 02:54:16.467
[SPEAKER_08]: The one that gets really pissed off when she sings and puts everyone to sleep that she draws on their face with a marker.

02:54:17.088 --> 02:54:18.949
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are always my favorite episodes of the old show.

02:54:19.630 --> 02:54:20.950
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, do you have a favorite Pokemon?

02:54:21.211 --> 02:54:22.391
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know any of the Pokemon.

02:54:25.273 --> 02:54:27.375
[SPEAKER_08]: One of these days I want to convince Loki to a bet.

02:54:27.415 --> 02:54:31.618
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, obviously we're never going to get him to dress up as the Tingle outfit, but we have to think of other things that would be awesome.

02:54:31.978 --> 02:54:35.380
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think one of them would be that Loki would have to sing the Pokemon rap on air.

02:54:35.401 --> 02:54:35.481
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

02:54:39.144 --> 02:54:41.065
[SPEAKER_08]: Aw, that's a cute little derpy mon.

02:54:41.085 --> 02:54:41.505
[SPEAKER_08]: I like this.

02:54:41.805 --> 02:54:43.045
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that the one you... That's Bidoof.

02:54:43.085 --> 02:54:43.465
[SPEAKER_05]: Bidoof?

02:54:45.605 --> 02:54:47.346
[SPEAKER_05]: On YouTube, everyone should Google.

02:54:47.426 --> 02:54:51.707
[SPEAKER_05]: It was UPN's Cartoon Afternoons.

02:54:51.907 --> 02:54:55.967
[SPEAKER_05]: It was one of the bumpers they made between Batman, the animated series, and Pokemon.

02:54:56.688 --> 02:54:58.968
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's Batman Sings Jigglypuff.

02:54:59.008 --> 02:55:00.768
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you find it, you should just pull it up right now.

02:55:01.549 --> 02:55:02.169
[SPEAKER_05]: Super awesome.

02:55:02.189 --> 02:55:04.849
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a bumper that UPN made.

02:55:04.889 --> 02:55:07.150
[SPEAKER_05]: Could it be this right here?

02:55:08.530 --> 02:55:10.352
[SPEAKER_09]: Jigglypuff, a balloon Pokemon.

02:55:10.372 --> 02:55:11.472
[SPEAKER_09]: Time for bed.

02:55:12.093 --> 02:55:13.774
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, but a deal's a deal.

02:55:14.375 --> 02:55:14.815
[SPEAKER_09]: No way.

02:55:15.156 --> 02:55:16.136
[SPEAKER_00]: You promised.

02:55:18.118 --> 02:55:25.985
[SPEAKER_09]: Jigglypuff, Jigglypuff.

02:55:27.986 --> 02:55:29.868
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, can I... The whole thing.

02:55:33.775 --> 02:55:38.499
[SPEAKER_09]: Pokemon Next on Kids WB WB, not UPN, my bad.

02:55:39.740 --> 02:55:41.121
[SPEAKER_08]: Ah, same thing now, it doesn't matter.

02:55:42.102 --> 02:55:42.842
[SPEAKER_08]: Good times.

02:55:43.423 --> 02:55:44.243
[SPEAKER_08]: I love Jigglypuff.

02:55:45.124 --> 02:55:48.226
[SPEAKER_08]: Some tweets from TigerClaw305, sends us a couple tweets.

02:55:48.707 --> 02:55:51.169
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought you hit on this one earlier in the show, Loki.

02:55:51.269 --> 02:55:54.912
[SPEAKER_08]: Was it the Portal 2 DLC that will have an in-game map editor with it?

02:55:55.092 --> 02:55:55.292
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

02:55:55.832 --> 02:55:57.253
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought you'd mention something about that.

02:55:57.313 --> 02:56:00.156
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it does come with an in-game map editor as well, if you didn't already know.

02:56:00.756 --> 02:56:01.477
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's cool.

02:56:02.417 --> 02:56:04.518
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'll see you next time.

02:56:27.256 --> 02:56:27.656
[SPEAKER_08]: and DarkSakura.

02:56:53.207 --> 02:56:56.828
[SPEAKER_08]: and it's going to have an online co-op mode that can affect the single player game.

02:56:57.389 --> 02:56:57.809
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.

02:56:58.169 --> 02:57:08.592
[SPEAKER_08]: So yep, if you activate a Battlefield 3 online pass on any of the platforms, I guess the EA account, your account will just be enabled with this access to get the demo.

02:57:09.053 --> 02:57:12.554
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's kind of cool on whatever system the code was redeemed on.

02:57:14.017 --> 02:57:15.918
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, no, I take that back.

02:57:16.198 --> 02:57:18.599
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't have to be for the account that you bought it on.

02:57:18.659 --> 02:57:27.063
[SPEAKER_08]: It says that the access is applied to the EA account, so meaning if you buy Battlefield 3 on the PC, you can get the demo on the PlayStation 3 or whatever you want to do.

02:57:27.083 --> 02:57:29.644
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's kind of tradable amongst those.

02:57:30.105 --> 02:57:30.685
[SPEAKER_08]: That's kind of neat.

02:57:31.926 --> 02:57:36.868
[SPEAKER_08]: There will be other ways for the rest of us to get in there if you're not buying Battlefield 3, so don't cry.

02:57:38.380 --> 02:57:43.785
[SPEAKER_08]: Lastly, but not leastly, a couple of tweets from Ramaditya Knight sends us some tweets.

02:57:44.225 --> 02:57:49.629
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, OLR, the Sonic 1 and 2 soundtrack to celebrate his 20th birthday has been released this month.

02:57:49.970 --> 02:57:51.551
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you're a Sonic fan, you should go get it.

02:57:51.591 --> 02:57:55.795
[SPEAKER_08]: I seem to remember a story on that coming up before, like when it was first announced, but it's good to know that it's out.

02:57:56.435 --> 02:57:58.277
[SPEAKER_08]: And you might remember that name Ramaditya...

02:57:58.817 --> 02:58:24.896
[SPEAKER_08]: Ramaditya Knight does a lot of these tin whistle or the recorder he does like a lot of these songs and he sent us a new YouTube at his account which is Ramaditya Skywalker and he's actually playing the Green Hill Zone theme obviously he's using the background that might not be the best part where he's playing the same three notes over and over

02:58:27.751 --> 02:58:32.132
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a little better.

02:58:32.152 --> 02:58:32.772
[SPEAKER_08]: Still irritating.

02:58:32.812 --> 02:58:35.672
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, hey, hey, I don't see you playing a musical instrument.

02:58:35.732 --> 02:58:36.993
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think you should be making fun.

02:58:37.493 --> 02:58:38.693
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think you should be making fun.

02:58:39.313 --> 02:58:40.173
[SPEAKER_08]: I think you're talented.

02:58:40.213 --> 02:58:40.993
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't listen to Loki.

02:58:42.614 --> 02:58:44.034
[SPEAKER_08]: I played the clarinet when I was younger.

02:58:44.814 --> 02:58:45.534
[SPEAKER_08]: You sure did.

02:58:45.654 --> 02:58:46.294
[SPEAKER_08]: I sure did.

02:58:47.374 --> 02:58:49.255
[SPEAKER_08]: I probably couldn't play that on the clarinet anymore.

02:58:49.375 --> 02:58:51.055
[SPEAKER_08]: I could probably play the squeak song.

02:58:51.095 --> 02:58:52.995
[SPEAKER_08]: That's probably about all I could play on the clarinet these days.

02:58:53.076 --> 02:58:53.676
[SPEAKER_08]: Band geek.

02:58:54.336 --> 02:58:54.716
[SPEAKER_08]: Shut up.

02:58:54.836 --> 02:58:55.796
[SPEAKER_08]: What's wrong with being a band geek?

02:58:57.413 --> 02:59:00.974
[SPEAKER_05]: I would try to be a band geek, but I was too weak to carry my instrument, and I was picked on.

02:59:00.994 --> 02:59:02.875
[SPEAKER_08]: That's because you tried to play the fucking tuba.

02:59:03.035 --> 02:59:04.195
[SPEAKER_08]: No, trombone.

02:59:04.315 --> 02:59:05.075
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, my bad.

02:59:05.375 --> 02:59:07.396
[SPEAKER_08]: But you were like this, weren't you like a really scrawny kid?

02:59:07.576 --> 02:59:07.856
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.

02:59:08.356 --> 02:59:09.756
[SPEAKER_08]: And now you're like six foot four?

02:59:10.157 --> 02:59:15.678
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm still weak as hell, but I'm six foot four-ish, so there's at least a lot of me, yeah.

02:59:17.099 --> 02:59:25.781
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, and the chat room is asking for a link of Ramaditya Knight's performance there, and stupid me forgot to link that, so let me do that right now.

02:59:27.219 --> 02:59:31.780
[SPEAKER_08]: for the chatters in the chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

02:59:31.820 --> 02:59:32.420
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

02:59:33.861 --> 02:59:34.301
[SPEAKER_08]: There it is.

02:59:34.381 --> 02:59:36.922
[SPEAKER_08]: And Ranma says in chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

02:59:37.002 --> 02:59:38.942
[SPEAKER_08]: And now Sky plays the skin flute.

02:59:39.562 --> 02:59:40.283
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, screw you.

02:59:41.043 --> 02:59:42.523
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

02:59:43.683 --> 02:59:44.084
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it.

02:59:44.484 --> 02:59:44.924
[SPEAKER_08]: We're done.

02:59:45.124 --> 02:59:47.004
[SPEAKER_08]: We're wrapping up another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:59:47.044 --> 02:59:49.365
[SPEAKER_08]: I got to ask first if there's any last minute stories, Loki.

02:59:50.700 --> 02:59:52.481
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, there was just one.

02:59:52.641 --> 03:00:03.810
[SPEAKER_06]: It was basically they announced that in Sonic Generations you can unlock the original Sonic the Hedgehog game.

03:00:04.150 --> 03:00:04.690
[SPEAKER_08]: Again?

03:00:05.591 --> 03:00:06.892
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's totally new news.

03:00:06.912 --> 03:00:09.174
[SPEAKER_06]: How many times did they release the first Sonic game for real?

03:00:09.294 --> 03:00:10.935
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely brand new news.

03:00:11.315 --> 03:00:15.058
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless you listened to our show back in August in which I actually revealed that same thing.

03:00:15.678 --> 03:00:17.960
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, totally new.

03:00:19.437 --> 03:00:26.365
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, if you somehow missed out on your nine other opportunities to re-buy Sonic the Hedgehog, the original, here you go.

03:00:26.825 --> 03:00:30.489
[SPEAKER_06]: Sonic Generations is bad, and they have a couple of dev ones out if you want to check them out.

03:00:30.789 --> 03:00:30.989
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.

03:00:31.890 --> 03:00:32.171
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

03:00:32.391 --> 03:00:34.974
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that's going to wrap up another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

03:00:35.294 --> 03:00:37.857
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to go around first and get everybody's final thought.

03:00:38.057 --> 03:00:41.381
[SPEAKER_08]: And my final thought tonight is skinny fries.

03:00:42.293 --> 03:00:42.913
[SPEAKER_08]: I am full of them.

03:00:42.993 --> 03:00:43.894
[SPEAKER_08]: We ate that whole bag.

03:00:44.014 --> 03:00:44.794
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, we're fat.

03:00:44.974 --> 03:00:45.735
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, you know what, though?

03:00:45.895 --> 03:00:47.636
[SPEAKER_08]: In that entire bag, there's only six grams of fat.

03:00:47.676 --> 03:00:48.216
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not that bad.

03:00:48.776 --> 03:00:50.137
[SPEAKER_08]: There's more grams of fat like in a muffin.

03:00:51.438 --> 03:00:51.698
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

03:00:52.478 --> 03:00:53.779
[SPEAKER_08]: Salacious Pop, what's your final thought tonight?

03:00:55.260 --> 03:00:56.680
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for being here, by the way, and filling in.

03:00:56.841 --> 03:00:57.261
[SPEAKER_08]: Always appreciate it.

03:00:57.281 --> 03:00:57.721
[SPEAKER_05]: You're welcome.

03:00:57.741 --> 03:00:58.381
[SPEAKER_05]: Always a pleasure.

03:00:58.621 --> 03:00:58.862
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

03:00:59.102 --> 03:01:02.664
[SPEAKER_05]: My final thought, I guess, is we need to get food because I'm hungry.

03:01:03.644 --> 03:01:04.544
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you getting a headache again?

03:01:05.245 --> 03:01:05.605
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of.

03:01:05.645 --> 03:01:07.246
[SPEAKER_05]: My stomach's been kicking.

03:01:07.786 --> 03:01:09.607
[SPEAKER_08]: And Loki, last but not least, your final thought tonight?

03:01:09.967 --> 03:01:11.188
[SPEAKER_08]: Crackers need to get crackin'.

03:01:13.157 --> 03:01:16.039
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

03:01:16.179 --> 03:01:20.861
[SPEAKER_08]: If you liked our show, you know all we ask you guys, tell a friend or two about the show.

03:01:21.022 --> 03:01:23.103
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't have advertising big dollars.

03:01:23.343 --> 03:01:24.644
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not a huge operation.

03:01:24.964 --> 03:01:26.905
[SPEAKER_08]: Word of mouth is really what keeps our show alive.

03:01:27.205 --> 03:01:29.046
[SPEAKER_08]: Leave us a nice review on iTunes if you could.

03:01:29.086 --> 03:01:30.687
[SPEAKER_08]: We haven't gotten any of those in a long time.

03:01:30.727 --> 03:01:31.888
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been about a month or two.

03:01:32.288 --> 03:01:49.674

[SPEAKER_08]: We really, really appreciate every single vote.

03:01:58.880 --> 03:02:02.702
[SPEAKER_08]: Even if we don't win, we have really felt a lot of love from the community, which has been great.

03:02:02.903 --> 03:02:07.906
[SPEAKER_08]: I've seen other podcasters retweeting and supporting us, especially the All Games family.

03:02:07.926 --> 03:02:16.472
[SPEAKER_08]: So I really, before we sign off tonight, want to give a heartfelt thank you to all the All Games people who have really rallied behind us in helping us to win.

03:02:16.512 --> 03:02:19.434
[SPEAKER_08]: And if, if, if, if, if we do win,

03:02:20.254 --> 03:02:25.137
[SPEAKER_08]: It will be in large part thanks to that and all of their efforts.

03:02:25.338 --> 03:02:27.359
[SPEAKER_08]: So really, really, really appreciate it.

03:02:28.280 --> 03:02:29.480
[SPEAKER_08]: So I guess that's going to do it.

03:02:30.501 --> 03:02:31.442
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll be back next week.

03:02:31.482 --> 03:02:33.063
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura will be back from Disneyland.

03:02:33.103 --> 03:02:38.046
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure to tell us all about her adventures on Space Mountain, maybe at Electronica or whatever else she's been doing there.

03:02:38.366 --> 03:02:44.310
[SPEAKER_08]: And we'll talk about whatever else comes up in gaming with our bit of wit and sassy commentary.

03:02:44.831 --> 03:02:47.352
[SPEAKER_08]: Until then, be safe.

03:02:47.632 --> 03:02:48.253
