WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:19.120
The PlayStation Vita has an American launch date.

00:19.120 --> 00:22.680
Blizzard will throw in a free game if you commit to a year of Warcraft.

00:22.680 --> 00:31.360
And updates to the 3DS firmware are detailed.

00:31.360 --> 00:34.840
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

00:34.840 --> 00:38.840
where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.

00:38.840 --> 00:46.800
We are live at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com with the 433rd episode of our show for this

00:46.800 --> 00:52.080
October the 20, what is it today, the 23rd of 2011.

00:52.080 --> 00:55.680
We do tape live every Sunday night at All Games Radio right after the Bobby Black Wolf

00:55.680 --> 00:56.680
Show.

00:56.680 --> 00:59.240
6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, about.

00:59.240 --> 01:03.080
My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours, not sadly with

01:03.080 --> 01:05.520
my awesome co-host Dark Sakura.

01:05.520 --> 01:06.620
She has the night off.

01:06.620 --> 01:09.480
She is en route to Anaheim right now.

01:09.480 --> 01:11.880
She's going to Blizzcon a little too late.

01:11.880 --> 01:14.920
No, obviously what's next door to Blizzcon?

01:14.920 --> 01:15.920
Disneyland.

01:15.920 --> 01:18.400
And that is the true destination for her and the hubby.

01:18.400 --> 01:21.600
But joining me tonight is the one and only tech master, Loki.

01:21.600 --> 01:22.600
Hello.

01:22.600 --> 01:23.600
How you doing, Loki?

01:23.600 --> 01:24.600
I'm doing fine.

01:24.600 --> 01:25.600
Awesome.

01:25.600 --> 01:28.360
So what is the perennial question for our chat room?

01:28.360 --> 01:31.160
They always want to know what was dinner tonight?

01:31.160 --> 01:34.480
Double Western Bacon Cheeseburger from Carl's Jr.

01:34.480 --> 01:35.480
Awesome.

01:35.480 --> 01:36.480
Chat.

01:36.480 --> 01:41.800
Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to join us live in our chat room.

01:41.800 --> 01:48.000
Joining us tonight, since Dark Sakura is not here, we do have another panelist here tonight.

01:48.000 --> 01:53.100
So kind to always fill in on all the OLR network shows when there's an opening.

01:53.100 --> 01:55.920
Say hello to the one and only Salacious Pop.

01:55.920 --> 01:56.920
What up?

01:56.920 --> 01:58.360
How you doing, Salacious Pop?

01:58.360 --> 01:59.360
I'm doing alright.

01:59.360 --> 02:00.360
How are you?

02:00.360 --> 02:02.360
Sup?

02:02.360 --> 02:03.360
I am good.

02:03.360 --> 02:04.360
What's new with you?

02:04.360 --> 02:06.880
How's life been treating you?

02:06.880 --> 02:07.880
Fairly boring.

02:07.880 --> 02:08.880
I'm around.

02:08.880 --> 02:09.880
I live with you.

02:09.880 --> 02:10.880
You should know.

02:10.880 --> 02:11.880
You don't have to ask me that.

02:11.880 --> 02:15.360
Well, this is what we call Radio Banter, where you entertain the listeners.

02:15.360 --> 02:17.760
You still have a lot to learn, young one.

02:17.760 --> 02:18.760
Alright.

02:18.760 --> 02:19.760
Join our chat room.

02:19.760 --> 02:20.760
Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

02:20.760 --> 02:25.360
DDRDollarBill is in our chat room tonight saying it's an all-male review.

02:25.360 --> 02:29.000
Yes, tonight is an all-male review.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.320
Maybe we'll have some female callers.

02:30.320 --> 02:31.320
We'll see.

02:31.320 --> 02:34.560
We will take your live calls later on in the show in Part B.

02:34.560 --> 02:39.840
Getting right into the video game chat tonight, Derek H. throws down the gauntlet, so to speak,

02:39.840 --> 02:40.840
in our chat room.

02:40.840 --> 02:46.040
OLR, I would like to invite you and your listeners to participate in the big battle racing series

02:46.040 --> 02:47.760
on Forza 4.

02:47.760 --> 02:49.880
Now I have heard about the big battle that's going on.

02:49.880 --> 02:54.200
It's this thing that Derek does with a lot of the all-game shows, and I participated

02:54.200 --> 02:56.580
in one a little while ago when it was pinball.

02:56.580 --> 03:02.440
The only reservation I have is that it's Forza 4, and I really stink at the Forza series.

03:02.440 --> 03:04.360
I'm usually more into the arcade racers.

03:04.360 --> 03:09.680
Like if we were talking like Blur, Burnout, Mario Kart, like that's the stuff up my alley.

03:09.680 --> 03:13.140
The real stuff, like Forza, Gran Turismo, I am terrible at that stuff.

03:13.140 --> 03:14.640
I consistently drive in walls.

03:14.640 --> 03:16.120
Are you a Forza person, Loki?

03:16.120 --> 03:18.880
Would you be able to represent the OL Army?

03:18.880 --> 03:21.080
I don't even have Forza.

03:21.080 --> 03:26.640
I need someone to step up in our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com to participate

03:26.640 --> 03:27.760
on behalf of OLR.

03:27.760 --> 03:29.160
We need somebody to do it.

03:29.160 --> 03:33.000
Somebody needs to show that we are not all weak when it comes to racing games.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.440
But of course, when Mario Kart 7 comes out, it's on.

03:35.440 --> 03:37.180
You'd play it if it was Initial D, right?

03:37.180 --> 03:38.180
You love that game.

03:38.180 --> 03:39.720
Yeah, as long as it had like Eurobeat in the background.

03:39.720 --> 03:40.720
Or Outrun.

03:40.720 --> 03:41.720
That would be awesome.

03:41.720 --> 03:43.360
But see, Initial D, again, is an arcade racer.

03:43.360 --> 03:46.080
And I love Midnight Maximum Tune in the arcades.

03:46.080 --> 03:48.120
I'd be down with Ridge Racer.

03:48.120 --> 03:49.120
Ridge Racer.

03:49.120 --> 03:50.120
Ridge Racer!

03:50.120 --> 03:53.680
Anyway, if you want more information on that, you want to sign up on behalf of Orange Lounge

03:53.680 --> 03:54.680
Radio.

03:54.680 --> 03:57.280
TheBigBattle.net.

03:57.280 --> 03:59.280
So check that out.

03:59.280 --> 04:05.400
And yeah, we need some helps representing Forza 4, because lord knows I can't.

04:05.400 --> 04:11.680
Alright, before we get into our gaming week, I wanted to talk about this a little bit.

04:11.680 --> 04:13.140
Well first, I gotta throw this out there.

04:13.140 --> 04:15.240
We've been mentioning this the past couple weeks on the show.

04:15.240 --> 04:16.840
I gotta reiterate this.

04:16.840 --> 04:23.800
We are nominated in the 2011 Podcast Awards, www.podcastawards.com.

04:23.800 --> 04:25.320
And we need your votes.

04:25.320 --> 04:27.720
You can vote every day between now and the 27th.

04:27.720 --> 04:29.600
We mentioned this last week on the show.

04:29.600 --> 04:31.080
We don't ask a lot here at Orange Lounge Radio.

04:31.080 --> 04:33.160
We don't play advertising on the show.

04:33.160 --> 04:37.620
We don't ask for your money or premium subscriptions or sell any apps or anything like that.

04:37.620 --> 04:40.640
So you know, if you like what you hear, all we ask is that you spread the word.

04:40.640 --> 04:42.400
We say that at the end of every show.

04:42.400 --> 04:45.320
And winning the award would be great for promotion.

04:45.320 --> 04:49.000
And not just us, but the network we're on, it would be terrific.

04:49.000 --> 04:54.140
We won the award back in 2005 when podcasting was like first, first out there.

04:54.140 --> 04:55.680
And it was great promotion then.

04:55.680 --> 05:00.400
But since then, a lot of corporate casts have come in and really just dominated, because

05:00.400 --> 05:04.200
you know, they can put ads in their magazines and they get millions of visitors on their

05:04.200 --> 05:05.200
sites.

05:05.200 --> 05:10.080
So us lowly independents, you know, have struggled a lot to promote amongst that.

05:10.080 --> 05:11.980
Now there's a lot of great independent shows nominated.

05:11.980 --> 05:12.980
So I'm feeling pretty good.

05:12.980 --> 05:15.840
At least some deserving independent will win.

05:15.840 --> 05:19.860
But of course, we'd like it to be us, I'm not going to lie.

05:19.860 --> 05:26.640
So please, if you enjoy Orange Lounge Radio, consider voting for us in the podcast awards.

05:26.640 --> 05:28.360
Dark Sakura will be back next week too.

05:28.360 --> 05:32.040
I had a little note to mention that for those that are Dark Sakura fans.

05:32.040 --> 05:34.240
We will still have a classic game of the week and all that fun stuff tonight.

05:34.240 --> 05:35.240
So stay tuned.

05:35.240 --> 05:39.600
I want to talk about this story too before we get into the gaming weeks and the news

05:39.600 --> 05:40.600
and all that.

05:40.600 --> 05:44.320
And that is this interesting way that gaming maybe is changing.

05:44.320 --> 05:47.920
This little kind of like blink and you miss it story came up this week and it was about

05:47.920 --> 05:48.920
FIFA 12.

05:48.920 --> 05:52.040
And especially for a lot of the people in our audience, I know we don't have as many

05:52.040 --> 05:56.240
sports games fans, you know, because I know a lot of you guys, we started with music games,

05:56.240 --> 05:58.560
a lot of you in role playing games, some of that too.

05:58.560 --> 06:02.560
But certainly there's the occasional sports game that we all enjoy.

06:02.560 --> 06:08.880
You know, for me, the old NBA Jam, Blades of Steel, a lot of the old school stuff.

06:08.880 --> 06:13.800
But what I think is interesting about this whole FIFA 12 thing is that you can play FIFA

06:13.800 --> 06:18.360
12, at least a demo of it, right, via YouTube.

06:18.360 --> 06:23.080
And I guess it's like a partnership that this company Gaikai is doing with YouTube where

06:23.080 --> 06:27.080
you go on and you can go to this page to visit, you know, information about FIFA 12 and you

06:27.080 --> 06:29.500
can actually stream this demo.

06:29.500 --> 06:32.340
You don't download anything to your computer or what have you.

06:32.340 --> 06:33.340
It's like OnLife.

06:33.340 --> 06:37.320
This is basically an OnLife competitor but no standalone client.

06:37.320 --> 06:39.560
I guess it's all run through Java or what have you.

06:39.560 --> 06:45.600
So you can go on, check out this game, and stream it and all the graphics and everything

06:45.600 --> 06:50.240
through the magic of the cloud gaming and all that stuff so you're not really downloading

06:50.240 --> 06:52.080
a whole lot to your computer.

06:52.080 --> 06:56.640
And while this might not seem like such a big deal at first, I kind of go like, okay,

06:56.640 --> 06:59.360
well, hold on a minute.

06:59.360 --> 07:06.520
If this is going on YouTube, which is how we watch a lot of like movies and music videos

07:06.520 --> 07:09.480
now, I mean, does MTV play music videos anymore?

07:09.480 --> 07:10.480
No.

07:10.480 --> 07:11.480
Sometimes.

07:11.480 --> 07:12.480
Where do we get our music videos?

07:12.480 --> 07:14.080
I think they have a show that does that.

07:14.080 --> 07:15.880
Like one show that comes on at midnight?

07:15.880 --> 07:16.880
All right.

07:16.880 --> 07:19.080
Beavis and Butthead is coming back this week.

07:19.080 --> 07:20.720
So that's old school.

07:20.720 --> 07:23.600
That is awesome.

07:23.600 --> 07:24.600
But what does this mean?

07:24.600 --> 07:26.660
Do you think this could mean anything for the future of gaming?

07:26.660 --> 07:31.020
Because now we've got two companies that are going into cloud gaming and later on tonight

07:31.020 --> 07:35.820
we're going to get into rumors about the Xbox and whatever next is for them and then PlayStation

07:35.820 --> 07:36.820
4.

07:36.820 --> 07:37.820
What?

07:37.820 --> 07:40.480
I mean, could this be technology that we see built into consoles?

07:40.480 --> 07:44.280
Is this something that's going to go wider, do you think?

07:44.280 --> 07:49.160
This kind of reminds me of that vaporware console that was announced around the time

07:49.160 --> 07:53.680
the 360 and the PS3 were, which was, I believe the Phantom, if you remember that, where you

07:53.680 --> 07:58.680
could sign up to sign up to get the preliminary launch announcement.

07:58.680 --> 07:59.680
I do remember that.

07:59.680 --> 08:03.080
And I think that's why a lot of people kind of laughed on live when it first came out.

08:03.080 --> 08:04.080
Yeah.

08:04.080 --> 08:05.080
And then I remember going to that E3.

08:05.080 --> 08:07.640
Were you at that E3 Loki or was that the year after you went?

08:07.640 --> 08:08.640
Yeah.

08:08.640 --> 08:09.640
Okay.

08:09.640 --> 08:12.560
Remember when on live was there on the floor and it was like, holy shit, it works.

08:12.560 --> 08:15.600
Like a lot of people were like, okay, wait, where's the box?

08:15.600 --> 08:16.600
What's the trick?

08:16.600 --> 08:19.800
And like, that was really people's reaction to on live is holy shit, it works.

08:19.800 --> 08:23.100
Now on live's biggest challenge is getting the games on the service.

08:23.100 --> 08:26.320
You know, they don't really have a lot unfortunately, but it works.

08:26.320 --> 08:29.940
But yeah, the Phantom and all that kind of, it wasn't so much skeptical.

08:29.940 --> 08:34.480
It wasn't so much a gaming console as it was a gaming appliance, but that didn't really

08:34.480 --> 08:37.960
seem like, you know, there was no way to actually load media onto it.

08:37.960 --> 08:41.060
It was all kind of DS DLC or all streaming.

08:41.060 --> 08:44.280
And that seems like, well, why can't you just do that on a computer once they can figure

08:44.280 --> 08:47.120
out the parity between the bandwidth and the response time?

08:47.120 --> 08:48.360
And it sounds like it's here.

08:48.360 --> 08:49.360
So yeah.

08:49.360 --> 08:50.360
I bet.

08:50.360 --> 08:52.000
Do you think this is something that we could see?

08:52.000 --> 08:55.820
I mean, you know, right now we have X-Box live arcade where you download these little

08:55.820 --> 08:58.040
games to the console and your PlayStation network.

08:58.040 --> 09:01.720
Do you think there's going to come a time where we stream games services?

09:01.720 --> 09:02.720
Yeah, absolutely.

09:02.720 --> 09:07.160
Because I mean, as bandwidth gets better, it's going to get even easier to stream something

09:07.160 --> 09:08.480
like that.

09:08.480 --> 09:11.280
And I mean, they're only a couple hundred meg at most.

09:11.280 --> 09:17.100
I mean, well, some of them are like a couple gig, but you know, they have limits in size

09:17.100 --> 09:20.840
and stuff to what they can put on X-Box live arcade.

09:20.840 --> 09:23.320
So it would be possible to stream something like that.

09:23.320 --> 09:28.000
Or if they have a way to where they could split the game up, you know, by level or whatever

09:28.000 --> 09:32.400
so that you start streaming the game and as you progress through the game, you have the

09:32.400 --> 09:36.480
rest of the levels are streaming in, then yeah, definitely it's something they could

09:36.480 --> 09:37.480
do.

09:37.480 --> 09:42.040
Plus, you know, with all the announcements like a couple weeks ago where, you know, both

09:42.040 --> 09:50.840
Unreal's now being supported in web browsers and you know, also Crytek is looking at getting

09:50.840 --> 09:54.800
the CryEngine in, you know, to Flash as well.

09:54.800 --> 09:59.800
So you know, with that stuff coming about, yeah, I can definitely see them doing a lot

09:59.800 --> 10:04.720
more gaming on demand type stuff through web browsers because I mean, that way you don't

10:04.720 --> 10:06.080
even have to sell a console.

10:06.080 --> 10:09.580
So that could be kind of bad news for consoles actually, if you think about it.

10:09.580 --> 10:13.200
Could you imagine in the future, I mean, this might be actually a horrible thing, but maybe

10:13.200 --> 10:14.200
we're already there.

10:14.200 --> 10:15.200
I don't know.

10:15.200 --> 10:18.780
But remember how like we would go to arcades?

10:18.780 --> 10:21.920
Remember the arcade when they weren't full of ticket machines, we would go there to like

10:21.920 --> 10:23.480
play against people and stuff.

10:23.480 --> 10:29.760
I mean, what about a system where you deposit a virtual quarter or a token and play a game

10:29.760 --> 10:34.360
streaming against, you know, play around a SoulCalibur 2 or I guess now it would be 5

10:34.360 --> 10:35.840
against somebody long distance.

10:35.840 --> 10:38.820
I mean, I think we're kind of already there.

10:38.820 --> 10:42.520
That will work and here's why, it's because they've tried that already with like the IOS

10:42.520 --> 10:43.520
stuff.

10:43.520 --> 10:47.560
You have, you know, the Capcom games where you can pay a quarter to play an arcade game

10:47.560 --> 10:52.020
on, you know, a handheld system or something like that and people are like, no, I'm not

10:52.020 --> 10:53.020
going to do that.

10:53.020 --> 10:57.860
Yeah, and IOS also sucks for gaming unless the game is built around the touchscreen.

10:57.860 --> 11:02.320
Even if it was, you know, on my computer and I had a controller and stuff like that, I

11:02.320 --> 11:04.520
would not pay per game.

11:04.520 --> 11:06.020
No, screw that.

11:06.020 --> 11:07.320
I bought the game.

11:07.320 --> 11:08.320
I'm going to play the game.

11:08.320 --> 11:11.480
But you used to play 50 cents per round of DDR.

11:11.480 --> 11:13.120
Yeah, and that's a little bit different.

11:13.120 --> 11:14.120
Or a dollar, shit.

11:14.120 --> 11:16.960
Are they going to ship me some pads and ship me a nice arcade system?

11:16.960 --> 11:22.240
Then yeah, well, I'll consider it then, but it's not like that.

11:22.240 --> 11:27.280
You're using all my hardware and all you're doing is sending me the code for your game.

11:27.280 --> 11:30.400
Well, it's being, it's being rendered offsite though, right?

11:30.400 --> 11:33.560
It's just being streamed to you.

11:33.560 --> 11:35.680
Like you don't need the graphics card or anything, right?

11:35.680 --> 11:36.680
It's in the cloud.

11:36.680 --> 11:40.400
It's all in the cloud through the magic of the cloud.

11:40.400 --> 11:41.400
You know, I don't like the cloud.

11:41.400 --> 11:42.400
You know what?

11:42.400 --> 11:43.400
Fuck the cloud.

11:43.400 --> 11:44.400
Is that what you're saying?

11:44.400 --> 11:45.400
Fuck the cloud.

11:45.400 --> 11:46.400
Yeah.

11:46.400 --> 11:52.480
He was Final Fantasy's best antagonist and I don't know why, no, I'm kidding.

11:52.480 --> 11:55.720
You know, it's kind of, you know, also kind of this whole discussion about arcades and

11:55.720 --> 11:59.540
things makes you think, and it makes me kind of sad is that are we ever going to have anything

11:59.540 --> 12:01.120
like DDR ever again?

12:01.120 --> 12:04.720
And I don't mean like the game itself, but I mean kind of like the community that that

12:04.720 --> 12:10.360
built, which includes this show, which started nine years ago, guitar hero and rock band,

12:10.360 --> 12:11.360
right?

12:11.360 --> 12:12.360
And that's even, that's kind of came and went.

12:12.360 --> 12:13.360
That's not what I mean though.

12:13.360 --> 12:17.640
I'm talking about we used to go to the arcade to celebrate people's birthdays and sit around

12:17.640 --> 12:20.720
the fourth mix machine and watch people fuck off.

12:20.720 --> 12:25.360
The problem is it's not profitable as much for arcades anymore to have that kind of stuff

12:25.360 --> 12:26.760
in their arcades.

12:26.760 --> 12:31.180
So you, what you need to do is you need to have arcades that really just want that there

12:31.180 --> 12:34.200
and find a way to become profitable as well.

12:34.200 --> 12:38.440
How do you get people to leave the couch when it's so easy now to click button play game?

12:38.440 --> 12:42.520
Well, I think it's, I mean, you still can't emulate everything that you can do in the

12:42.520 --> 12:43.520
arcade.

12:43.520 --> 12:47.880
I mean, the experiences in the arcade are still going to be vastly superior as far as,

12:47.880 --> 12:49.960
you know, controls go.

12:49.960 --> 12:53.400
I mean, arcade sticks and stuff like that, yeah, definitely supplement that, but not

12:53.400 --> 12:56.440
everyone's buying that and it's still, you know, fun to play in the arcade.

12:56.440 --> 13:00.640
But the problem is, yeah, a lot of people are playing stuff that they could play in

13:00.640 --> 13:04.800
the arcade at home, like fighting games and racing games and stuff like that.

13:04.800 --> 13:08.440
But yeah, dancing games and stuff, I don't think that's really something you can emulate

13:08.440 --> 13:09.440
at home.

13:09.440 --> 13:10.440
Yeah.

13:10.440 --> 13:11.440
You know, they've danced in revolution.

13:11.440 --> 13:14.000
I'm not even necessarily talking about a dancing game or a music game.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.800
I'm just talking about a game that establishes such a sense of community.

13:16.800 --> 13:20.200
The closest thing I can think of that I see now is maybe like some of the racing games.

13:20.200 --> 13:23.800
Like, I do still see, like, Initial D has a pretty big contingent in the racing games

13:23.800 --> 13:24.800
in the arcade.

13:24.800 --> 13:25.800
There's, there's...

13:25.800 --> 13:27.760
Fighting, of course fighting games, of course fighting games.

13:27.760 --> 13:28.760
There's still communities.

13:28.760 --> 13:29.760
But it's not as big as it used to be.

13:29.760 --> 13:33.560
Well, there's still communities out there, but they're spread out or they're, you know,

13:33.560 --> 13:35.160
on Facebook or something like that.

13:35.160 --> 13:40.480
I mean, go to any, you know, gaming Facebook page and there's tons of people that are fans

13:40.480 --> 13:43.300
of that game on there talking about stuff.

13:43.300 --> 13:47.680
You know, if you want to get people excited about something at the arcade, you make it

13:47.680 --> 13:53.200
arcade only, you make a reason for people to go there constantly, just, you know, whether

13:53.200 --> 14:01.440
it be, you know, unlocking stuff on the machine or just some unique style of gameplay and

14:01.440 --> 14:02.440
people will go there.

14:02.440 --> 14:06.460
People will be, you know, have fun, create communities around it.

14:06.460 --> 14:10.960
It's just, unfortunately, you know, like Dance Dance Revolution started really much as an

14:10.960 --> 14:16.480
arcade game and yeah, there were some of the Japanese versions, but for a long time, that's

14:16.480 --> 14:20.200
all there was, was the arcade and that's why people would go there and then they formed

14:20.200 --> 14:21.200
a community around it.

14:21.200 --> 14:24.240
But then once they started coming out with a lot more home versions, yeah, you don't

14:24.240 --> 14:26.160
really necessarily need to go to the arcade anymore.

14:26.160 --> 14:28.920
Yeah, but the home versions had crap songs for the longest time.

14:28.920 --> 14:29.920
Yes, that's true.

14:29.920 --> 14:33.360
But then also a lot of the people grew up and they just decided.

14:33.360 --> 14:34.360
We all turned 30.

14:34.360 --> 14:35.360
Shit.

14:35.360 --> 14:38.440
They just decided, you know, I've got a lot more things going on.

14:38.440 --> 14:42.280
I can't really make it out to the arcade to go play games.

14:42.280 --> 14:49.920
I mean, it's just, you know, time, you know, do I go drive, you know, 10 minutes, 15 minutes

14:49.920 --> 14:55.000
or whatever to my arcade to go hang out by myself, you know, or.

14:55.000 --> 15:00.340
I think my, my mind was kind of going in this direction because I'd heard something, well,

15:00.340 --> 15:03.120
a DDR Freak officially closed this week.

15:03.120 --> 15:06.320
I mean, I know we had the talk a couple of weeks ago about how DDR Freak was closing

15:06.320 --> 15:09.880
and the server was offline, but the server came back up for J-Dog to post a message that

15:09.880 --> 15:14.680
said it's over, like the whole epilogue and the forums are locked down because of spam

15:14.680 --> 15:15.680
and everything.

15:15.680 --> 15:16.680
It is officially done.

15:16.680 --> 15:17.680
Game over.

15:17.680 --> 15:18.680
Failed.

15:18.680 --> 15:19.680
You know, that whole thing.

15:19.680 --> 15:20.680
So I don't know.

15:20.680 --> 15:21.920
It kind of had me thinking about the whole DDR and the community and all that because,

15:21.920 --> 15:22.920
you know, it was shit.

15:22.920 --> 15:24.400
We've been playing that game like 10 years.

15:24.400 --> 15:29.040
Yeah, but there's, that was one site and that's like kind of what it was.

15:29.040 --> 15:30.040
Let's be real.

15:30.040 --> 15:31.040
I get it.

15:31.040 --> 15:34.200
DDR is not dead and you know, it will always be a fitness school type thing, whatever.

15:34.200 --> 15:37.480
But like DDR Freak was the community for a long time.

15:37.480 --> 15:42.560
It was a community for a long time and then like 10 years ago it stopped being the community

15:42.560 --> 15:48.280
where everyone went and there's other communities out there and those communities are still

15:48.280 --> 15:50.760
live and just doing fine.

15:50.760 --> 15:53.920
You know, I'd heard rumors about speaking of arcades, communities, all that, the rumors

15:53.920 --> 16:00.100
about a DDR get together for the 20th of November, which I think is supposed to be a Sunday,

16:00.100 --> 16:03.040
but I haven't heard anything about if that's actually happening or not, but I think it

16:03.040 --> 16:04.040
should.

16:04.040 --> 16:07.720
I mean, if they're not going to organize something, I think we should.

16:07.720 --> 16:08.720
I don't know.

16:08.720 --> 16:11.720
I'll just have to, I'll have to find out and find out fast.

16:11.720 --> 16:12.720
That's only what?

16:12.720 --> 16:13.720
Like four weeks away?

16:13.720 --> 16:14.720
Something like that.

16:14.720 --> 16:16.280
So don't have a lot of time.

16:16.280 --> 16:17.280
There's no time.

16:17.280 --> 16:18.280
All right.

16:18.280 --> 16:19.520
Uh, let's move on.

16:19.520 --> 16:23.520
Um, let me get a couple more comments from our chat room at chat.orangelandsready.com.

16:23.520 --> 16:27.560
Derek H I think is trying to play this FIFA demo online and brings up an interesting point

16:27.560 --> 16:29.040
about just how easy this all is.

16:29.040 --> 16:32.520
Derek H says, this FIFA thing is stalled at starting game.

16:32.520 --> 16:33.700
Please wait a moment.

16:33.700 --> 16:35.800
Now I got to upgrade Java and the download failed.

16:35.800 --> 16:39.040
I think it would have been faster if they just let me download the demo.

16:39.040 --> 16:42.360
I don't like guy guy.

16:42.360 --> 16:44.200
And um, that's a pretty good point.

16:44.200 --> 16:47.560
You know, as simple as this all might be, push button play game.

16:47.560 --> 16:50.800
Doesn't always work.

16:50.800 --> 16:53.080
It's not always that easy.

16:53.080 --> 16:57.240
And really, I mean, yeah, the technology is cool and it might be fun to check it out because

16:57.240 --> 16:59.760
of the technology, but I don't give a crap about FIFA.

16:59.760 --> 17:01.600
I just don't.

17:01.600 --> 17:05.520
And I figure, you know, if I'm going to play a FIFA demo, I have a 360, I can download

17:05.520 --> 17:09.560
the demo for that, but it's FIFA now, but it might be another game later on that you

17:09.560 --> 17:10.560
are interested in.

17:10.560 --> 17:11.560
Right?

17:11.560 --> 17:12.560
Yeah.

17:12.560 --> 17:15.860
I think the genre of games that really stands out to me is that could really take advantage

17:15.860 --> 17:20.520
of this are free to play MMOs where you don't have to bog down your system with a bunch

17:20.520 --> 17:21.600
of crap to install it.

17:21.600 --> 17:25.800
You just log into a portal and it's all streamed to you because that's a great way to get the

17:25.800 --> 17:28.320
soccer moms or whatever to play because they don't need a graphics card.

17:28.320 --> 17:29.840
It's all rendered off site.

17:29.840 --> 17:34.920
So free MMOs and game demos, I could see really taking advantage of this, but for the kind

17:34.920 --> 17:38.440
of games that we like to play, I don't know, like Arkham City or whatever, you're going

17:38.440 --> 17:43.440
to need an installation on a local device, whether it's a console or PC, but I think

17:43.440 --> 17:47.520
for free, for free MMOs or freemium, this is great technology.

17:47.520 --> 17:52.480
All right, well, we're going to move on into our gaming weeks and the stuff that we've

17:52.480 --> 17:53.480
been playing this week.

17:53.480 --> 17:54.480
A couple other quick, quick announcements.

17:54.480 --> 17:57.720
I forgot to get this out there earlier, but I see some of you guys in chat room are like,

17:57.720 --> 17:59.160
I'm voting in the podcast awards.

17:59.160 --> 18:00.160
Okay.

18:00.160 --> 18:01.160
So thank you guys so much for doing that.

18:01.160 --> 18:05.200
I did want to mention one of the other members of the OL army, Brad from pod culture has

18:05.200 --> 18:09.000
a show in his network that's nominated and we want to throw our support behind him.

18:09.000 --> 18:13.400
He is with a show called the geek spin and it's nominated in pod safe music.

18:13.400 --> 18:15.280
I think it might just be called music in the awards.

18:15.280 --> 18:16.280
I can't remember.

18:16.280 --> 18:17.840
It's either pod safe, it's pod safe.

18:17.840 --> 18:18.960
Loki's been voting for it every day.

18:18.960 --> 18:20.580
So it's, it's the geek spin.

18:20.580 --> 18:23.240
And so, you know, as you're filling out your ballot, cause you can vote in one category,

18:23.240 --> 18:27.040
you can vote multiple, we would, you know, unless there's just some other pod safe music

18:27.040 --> 18:29.440
podcasts you just really freaking love.

18:29.440 --> 18:32.080
We'd appreciate if you'd throw your support to a fellow member of the OL army.

18:32.080 --> 18:35.680
If we can't win, maybe he can, that would be pretty cool.

18:35.680 --> 18:37.260
I think that was it.

18:37.260 --> 18:40.840
So let's move on to our gaming weeks and the video games that you have been playing this

18:40.840 --> 18:41.840
week.

18:41.840 --> 18:44.200
Salacious Pop, we'll start with you.

18:44.200 --> 18:46.800
Mostly world of Warcraft, of course.

18:46.800 --> 18:49.280
And I guessed it on your other podcast to talk about that.

18:49.280 --> 18:54.220
So we'll get to it in a minute, but obviously lots of big world of Warcraft news came out.

18:54.220 --> 18:55.520
So I played a lot of that.

18:55.520 --> 18:57.960
It's in the middle of the Halloween holiday.

18:57.960 --> 19:03.920
I also had an opportunity to play on the PS3, your Sega Genesis arcade collection.

19:03.920 --> 19:08.840
I was playing a lot of Dr. Robotnik's Bean Bean Machine because someone had commented

19:08.840 --> 19:14.220
on how fucking hard that game is because I know it's, it's a licensed clone of POPO.

19:14.220 --> 19:15.280
It's not really our Puyo Puyo.

19:15.280 --> 19:16.280
It's not really rip off.

19:16.280 --> 19:18.720
They, they just reskinned it with their permission.

19:18.720 --> 19:19.720
Yeah.

19:19.720 --> 19:21.080
That and Kirby's Avalanche came out at the same time.

19:21.080 --> 19:23.760
So I don't know if the same company had done them or what the deal is, but yeah.

19:23.760 --> 19:24.760
Yeah.

19:24.760 --> 19:30.800
And that is, I got to the fourth or fifth stage, you know, with only having to do each

19:30.800 --> 19:35.660
retry like once or twice, but yeah, that game is hard and the Streets of Rage 2 and a bunch

19:35.660 --> 19:37.660
of other stuff.

19:37.660 --> 19:41.380
And uh, isn't that game a really good deal for like 20 bucks because that's what it goes

19:41.380 --> 19:42.620
for now is 20 bucks.

19:42.620 --> 19:45.560
Just a little mini rant because I know you like those.

19:45.560 --> 19:50.380
What I love about the Genesis, the Sonic's best of Genesis collection is that there is

19:50.380 --> 19:55.460
some production and polish in how it looks when you load up the disc, but it's mostly

19:55.460 --> 19:57.420
just a list.

19:57.420 --> 19:59.660
Here are the ROMs that are on this.

19:59.660 --> 20:03.420
Here's a nice, pretty, you know, background screen to list everything out in.

20:03.420 --> 20:07.260
And then you just pick the game that you want and it loads up.

20:07.260 --> 20:14.700
Unlike another collection that we had an opportunity to play, which was the Namco, uh, the Namco

20:14.700 --> 20:20.540
Museum Megamix, where you load that up and you play a little 3D Pac-Man avatar and you

20:20.540 --> 20:24.440
have to jump over little platforms to get to the building that the ROM that you want

20:24.440 --> 20:25.440
to play it in.

20:25.440 --> 20:28.340
By the way, I looked at game FAQs, like you remember how there's all those power pellets

20:28.340 --> 20:31.940
everywhere and it's like, Ooh, I wonder what game you unlock if you eat them all, right?

20:31.940 --> 20:34.300
I looked on a game FAQ to see what you get.

20:34.300 --> 20:35.300
Nothing.

20:35.300 --> 20:36.300
It's all for show.

20:36.300 --> 20:37.300
It is.

20:37.300 --> 20:38.300
It means nothing.

20:38.300 --> 20:42.940
And maybe I'm just an old curmudgeon now, but I know there's a lot of controversy about

20:42.940 --> 20:47.820
repackaging retro content for a $40 disc when it's just shit that you played when you were

20:47.820 --> 20:53.420
15 or however young, you know, in the nineties on your Sega Genesis, releasing that content

20:53.420 --> 20:54.420
on a disc.

20:54.420 --> 20:55.420
Just give me a menu.

20:55.420 --> 20:59.340
Show me that you put some effort into packaging it and just let me, just let me pick it from

20:59.340 --> 21:00.340
a list.

21:00.340 --> 21:01.340
I'm easy to please.

21:01.340 --> 21:04.020
You know, and if they want to do the frou-frou stuff, fine, but they should have like an

21:04.020 --> 21:05.020
easy way.

21:05.020 --> 21:09.020
And another thing I liked about the Genesis collection was that versus the Namco Megamix,

21:09.020 --> 21:14.060
the Genesis collection has the extra interviews, it has arcade games you can unlock.

21:14.060 --> 21:18.340
There's things that you can work towards that aren't like just, you know, too distracting

21:18.340 --> 21:19.340
or terrible.

21:19.340 --> 21:20.340
You know what I mean?

21:20.340 --> 21:21.340
Yeah.

21:21.340 --> 21:22.340
So yeah.

21:22.340 --> 21:25.920
So loading up the Namco museum and direct Pac-Man to find the game that you want that's

21:25.920 --> 21:28.600
in one of these candy shaped buildings.

21:28.600 --> 21:31.700
There's also one other big difference between the Megamix and the Sega Genesis collection

21:31.700 --> 21:32.700
to be fair.

21:32.700 --> 21:35.660
And that is that they have all these new versions of games.

21:35.660 --> 21:40.760
Like one of the ones I played was Rally-X, which has now Pac-Man in the car dodging,

21:40.760 --> 21:45.540
not ghosts, but just boogers, just boogers and other cars.

21:45.540 --> 21:49.620
And it's kind of like a 3D version of Rally-X, which kind of ruins the charm of the original

21:49.620 --> 21:50.620
game.

21:50.620 --> 21:56.860
Like old school 2D games from 1983 don't translate well into 3D on the Wii if you don't change

21:56.860 --> 21:57.860
a lot.

21:57.860 --> 21:58.860
You know what I mean?

21:58.860 --> 22:02.020
Like it's just, the whole thing felt derpy to me.

22:02.020 --> 22:05.900
And I want to give a shout out to a DDR dollar bill in chat because he said that his gaming

22:05.900 --> 22:13.100
week with City of Heroes and they just launched their freemium free to play model, which included

22:13.100 --> 22:17.140
the cataclysm like redesign of the starter zones.

22:17.140 --> 22:19.000
Maybe a minor graphical upgrade.

22:19.000 --> 22:23.020
So I'm not really in a situation where I can check that out right now, but I'm just City

22:23.020 --> 22:24.020
of Heroes love.

22:24.020 --> 22:25.020
I played that game for years.

22:25.020 --> 22:26.020
I'm surprised.

22:26.020 --> 22:27.020
Why aren't you getting into that?

22:27.020 --> 22:28.020
Is it just too much?

22:28.020 --> 22:29.020
Wow.

22:29.020 --> 22:30.020
Or it's free.

22:30.020 --> 22:31.020
It runs on your computer, right?

22:31.020 --> 22:32.020
Yeah.

22:32.020 --> 22:33.860
I'm surprised you're not checking it out.

22:33.860 --> 22:37.140
Let me ask you this question too before you wrap up your gaming week because unlike the

22:37.140 --> 22:41.060
other show, the people that listen to this show, not everybody's into WoW.

22:41.060 --> 22:43.540
In fact, some people quite frankly hate it.

22:43.540 --> 22:46.060
So why do you play WoW?

22:46.060 --> 22:50.700
Well, what got me onto WoW originally was finding out how many gamer friends that I

22:50.700 --> 22:55.120
never really got to see in FaceTime were already playing on a certain server and it was the

22:55.120 --> 22:56.980
social aspect of it.

22:56.980 --> 23:02.940
So being able to interact with people that I know and it's very immersive.

23:02.940 --> 23:04.580
There's definitely stuff to do.

23:04.580 --> 23:07.820
It's the industry leader for subscriptions for a reason even though that's dwindling

23:07.820 --> 23:10.940
which we'll get to in a minute with a future story.

23:10.940 --> 23:17.500
But I played the hell out of Warcraft 3 and I knew I played the RTS campaign where the

23:17.500 --> 23:20.220
Scourge is there and Lich King and blah, blah, blah.

23:20.220 --> 23:25.740
So I didn't hop onto the WoW train immediately because I was still playing City of Heroes

23:25.740 --> 23:27.700
to be honest, so.

23:27.700 --> 23:28.700
Alright.

23:28.700 --> 23:29.700
Loki!

23:29.700 --> 23:30.700
Oh, I'm sorry.

23:30.700 --> 23:32.220
I'm assuming that was everything, right?

23:32.220 --> 23:33.220
Yes.

23:33.220 --> 23:34.220
Okay.

23:34.220 --> 23:35.220
Loki, how was your gaming week?

23:35.220 --> 23:36.220
I only played Grand Theft Auto.

23:36.220 --> 23:37.220
That's it?

23:37.220 --> 23:38.580
Yeah, it's pretty much it.

23:38.580 --> 23:41.700
I didn't get in time to play much of anything else.

23:41.700 --> 23:50.780
I don't think I played any Dead Rising 2 off the record this week.

23:50.780 --> 23:53.780
Gosh, you make it sound like you have a baby or something that takes all your time.

23:53.780 --> 23:57.420
Uh, no, actually it wasn't the baby that took all my time, it was modding Grand Theft Auto

23:57.420 --> 23:58.420
that took all my time.

23:58.420 --> 23:59.420
Modding Grand Theft Auto?

23:59.420 --> 24:00.420
What are you doing to Grand Theft Auto right now?

24:00.420 --> 24:08.100
Uh, just discovering new stuff, new techniques on how to do things, and uh, that really occupied

24:08.100 --> 24:09.100
all my time.

24:09.100 --> 24:11.440
Alright, um, let's see.

24:11.440 --> 24:16.780
My gaming week, I was playing Warcraft as well because you guys all know I'm into that.

24:16.780 --> 24:20.660
Final Fantasy XIV, I'm still kind of juggling the two games a little bit, you know, and

24:20.660 --> 24:23.140
I stand by what I said about the game last week.

24:23.140 --> 24:26.140
It's getting better, but there's still a lot of room for improvement and I'm probably not

24:26.140 --> 24:30.580
going to pay for it unless some miracle patch makes the game really.

24:30.580 --> 24:36.100
And I think a lot of what is ruining Final Fantasy XIV for me the more I play it is that

24:36.100 --> 24:42.180
I see how other MMOs, including WoW, like to put in a lot of quality of life improvements,

24:42.180 --> 24:47.300
but I feel like the Japanese developers have no concept of what a quality of life improvement

24:47.300 --> 24:48.300
is.

24:48.300 --> 24:50.940
I mean, I'm talking about like games I see developed over there versus games I see developed

24:50.940 --> 24:51.940
over here.

24:51.940 --> 24:56.140
It is that, you know, in order to do certain quests and stuff, I spend ten minutes running

24:56.140 --> 25:01.260
from point A to point B, and that's just, how is that fun to just run?

25:01.260 --> 25:05.020
You know, so I think if they are going to redesign their game, they really need to think

25:05.020 --> 25:10.220
about how do we make the game non-stop fun?

25:10.220 --> 25:13.940
That's the thing, because when the game's good, it's pretty good.

25:13.940 --> 25:17.500
Like you know, the battle systems actually, it's really neat to look at, it's different,

25:17.500 --> 25:20.540
you have to think about positioning of your characters as well as what you're doing, you

25:20.540 --> 25:24.060
know, it's very much unlike WoW, and I like that, it makes a nice break from WoW, and

25:24.060 --> 25:30.940
the storytelling is awesome, and the cutscenes are great, but when the game is in its downtime,

25:30.940 --> 25:33.220
it's dead time, it's really dead.

25:33.220 --> 25:37.720
You know, if I didn't have a link shell of people to talk to, I would poke my eyes out

25:37.720 --> 25:41.500
from boredom, and so I hope the developers are really going to think about how the game

25:41.500 --> 25:45.340
can be thrilling for ten minutes as opposed to every ten minutes.

25:45.340 --> 25:50.260
It sort of reminds me of the argument of what Japanese gamers want versus American gamers

25:50.260 --> 25:55.780
especially with JRPGs and how they're kind of tedious and min-max-y and how they just

25:55.780 --> 25:58.940
supposedly love that over there, whereas here we're more...

25:58.940 --> 26:00.540
I kind of think that's a cop-out.

26:00.540 --> 26:04.540
Like I don't think people here truly understand what people like over there, and you know,

26:04.540 --> 26:05.540
vice versa.

26:05.540 --> 26:10.060
Like I think sometimes people make excuses, like, oh it's a cultural thing, it's a cultural

26:10.060 --> 26:11.060
thing.

26:11.060 --> 26:12.060
I don't know.

26:12.060 --> 26:17.460
Yeah, because I heard that those lineage MMOs, which are huge over in that part of the world,

26:17.460 --> 26:22.300
are very kind of dry to play, like the grinding that you have to do.

26:22.300 --> 26:24.980
But again, I've never played it, so I'm mostly talking out of my ass, but...

26:24.980 --> 26:28.380
And I wonder if it's one of those things again where kind of like you and WoW, you know,

26:28.380 --> 26:31.060
your friends are there so you just play it, it's your thing.

26:31.060 --> 26:36.060
You know, if all my friends suddenly dropped WoW and went to Final Fantasy XIV, I'd have

26:36.060 --> 26:39.820
to reconsider what I'm saying, because at least in my ten minutes of run, run, run,

26:39.820 --> 26:43.080
run, run, run, run, run, run, run, all over the place, which is what, when Salacious

26:43.080 --> 26:45.340
Pop sees me playing Final Fantasy XIV, that's what he does.

26:45.340 --> 26:49.780
Because you play a little spriteling hobbit halfling little...

26:49.780 --> 26:50.780
Lalafell.

26:50.780 --> 26:51.780
Lalafell.

26:51.780 --> 26:54.540
So it's this cute little munchkin thing, and his little legs kick when he runs, and he

26:54.540 --> 26:57.220
does a lot of running to run from town to town.

26:57.220 --> 27:02.860
So I see his little wiggly legs tearing across the countryside, and run, run, run, run, run,

27:02.860 --> 27:04.020
run, run, run.

27:04.020 --> 27:05.020
So.

27:05.020 --> 27:06.020
Alright.

27:06.020 --> 27:07.020
Anyhow.

27:07.020 --> 27:10.740
A question from our chat room before I talk about one more game I played this week.

27:10.740 --> 27:15.000
Hitstun in our chat room asks, oh yeah, how did Skylander's sales do this week in Dark

27:15.000 --> 27:16.000
Tetsuya?

27:16.000 --> 27:18.260
I was disappointed that Loki didn't play Skylander's this week.

27:18.260 --> 27:20.340
So what's up with Skylander's?

27:20.340 --> 27:27.420
I don't have any sales data yet, and I was just checking on that, because VG Charts only

27:27.420 --> 27:31.480
has up through the 15th, and they came out on the 16th, so there's nothing yet.

27:31.480 --> 27:32.480
So we'll know soon.

27:32.480 --> 27:36.700
But based on the report I heard last week from a retail person, I mean, this is one

27:36.700 --> 27:39.340
retail person in one store, but it seems to be selling well.

27:39.340 --> 27:42.580
But then again, I went to Target, and I saw plenty of copies of the game and all the little

27:42.580 --> 27:48.620
dollies, which I gotta admit, there was a moment where I kinda went, oh that might actually

27:48.620 --> 27:49.620
be kind of fun.

27:49.620 --> 27:55.700
And then I just heard Loki in my brain going, no!

27:55.700 --> 27:56.700
Listen.

27:56.700 --> 27:58.860
Uh oh.

27:58.860 --> 28:01.740
Do I have to explain to you what this game is?

28:01.740 --> 28:06.660
You don't, but for the behalf of the listeners who would love to hear you explain it, please.

28:06.660 --> 28:08.420
Okay, well here's how it is.

28:08.420 --> 28:10.740
This whole game is just to sell toys.

28:10.740 --> 28:12.620
That's all it is.

28:12.620 --> 28:16.820
Yeah, it's a neat concept where, you know, it's kind of a hack and slash, reminds me

28:16.820 --> 28:20.580
of Gauntlet Legends, you know, that's kinda cool, you know, I like it.

28:20.580 --> 28:21.980
Gauntlet Legends is pretty badass.

28:21.980 --> 28:24.660
It's a pretty badass game, you know, that's awesome.

28:24.660 --> 28:28.460
I didn't need to buy little toys to play Gauntlet Legends, so I do appreciate that.

28:28.460 --> 28:30.620
But you did need a Dreamcast.

28:30.620 --> 28:33.460
Or the arcade.

28:33.460 --> 28:35.420
But here's the thing.

28:35.420 --> 28:38.300
This game is specifically made to sell toys.

28:38.300 --> 28:43.100
I mean, if you don't believe it, play the game.

28:43.100 --> 28:45.540
Play the game, okay, seriously.

28:45.540 --> 28:52.420
You start off with three figures, and it's three different elements, I guess.

28:52.420 --> 28:54.460
There's a total of eight different elements in the game.

28:54.460 --> 29:00.540
In order to see everything in the game, you have to buy all eight elements.

29:00.540 --> 29:05.100
And so you only have three characters to start off with, so that's, you know, another $40

29:05.100 --> 29:07.600
you gotta spend to see everything that's in the game.

29:07.600 --> 29:12.020
Of course, then you also have to buy the expansions to see what's in there as well, so that's

29:12.020 --> 29:14.780
another, you know, $40 on top of that.

29:14.780 --> 29:16.820
So $80 right there.

29:16.820 --> 29:17.820
And if you-

29:17.820 --> 29:20.780
But to be fair, I mean, there's a lot of video games that have download content, and if you

29:20.780 --> 29:24.020
want to see it all, quote unquote, you know, all the levels and stuff-

29:24.020 --> 29:27.580
Okay, that's fair, that a lot of games have download content.

29:27.580 --> 29:32.900
But to see everything on the disc, I don't have to spend another $40.

29:32.900 --> 29:38.360
Which is, you know, $40 on top of a game that's already too expensive as it is.

29:38.360 --> 29:44.460
And then, on top of that, you know, to entice kids to beg their parents for more characters,

29:44.460 --> 29:47.740
you can unlock abilities for characters you don't own.

29:47.740 --> 29:52.460
And then, it basically shows you a preview video of how awesome that character is and

29:52.460 --> 29:54.180
how badly you need it.

29:54.180 --> 29:55.820
And so-

29:55.820 --> 29:56.820
It's to get kids.

29:56.820 --> 29:57.820
It's to get kids.

29:57.820 --> 29:58.820
Mommy, mommy, mommy.

29:58.820 --> 29:59.820
I want, I want, I want.

29:59.820 --> 30:00.820
Exactly.

30:00.820 --> 30:04.620
I want more fucking targets looking for this figurine for Skylanders, and I can't find

30:04.620 --> 30:05.620
it.

30:05.620 --> 30:06.620
Right?

30:06.620 --> 30:07.620
Because you have to find the toy.

30:07.620 --> 30:09.300
And, and, you know, and I see a lot of-

30:09.300 --> 30:13.380
Thank God Oprah's not still on, because I could just see her going out to her audience,

30:13.380 --> 30:15.500
we're giving you Skylanders!

30:15.500 --> 30:20.660
And, and I see a lot of these blogging sites or whatever talking about how expensive it

30:20.660 --> 30:25.420
would be to buy everything, and how it's like $300 or something like that.

30:25.420 --> 30:27.700
Yeah, you're right, up to a point.

30:27.700 --> 30:28.860
That's wave one.

30:28.860 --> 30:32.300
That's just the first fucking, you know, stuff that's available right now.

30:32.300 --> 30:34.980
We haven't even talked about, like, stuff that's gonna be wave two or three.

30:34.980 --> 30:36.980
Series two, coming spring 2012.

30:36.980 --> 30:42.900
Seriously, you think that they're only gonna be limited to just 30 characters or whatever?

30:42.900 --> 30:46.100
Oh, you know, you are wrong, sir.

30:46.100 --> 30:47.940
Gotta catch them all.

30:47.940 --> 30:50.740
Going to our chat room, and I apologize if I'm mispronouncing this name, I think it's

30:50.740 --> 30:51.740
Zezby?

30:51.740 --> 30:52.740
Zeezby?

30:52.740 --> 30:57.060
Uh, in our chat room, uh, says, my mom bought this for my eight-year-old brother for his

30:57.060 --> 30:58.060
birthday.

30:58.060 --> 30:59.300
I tried to get her to return it.

30:59.300 --> 31:02.580
I then cried because she is now a tool and I can't prevent it.

31:02.580 --> 31:03.580
Well, here's the thing.

31:03.580 --> 31:06.260
I don't have a problem with people buying download content for the game.

31:06.260 --> 31:09.940
If this was, say, for example, a game that didn't have any toys whatsoever, and they

31:09.940 --> 31:15.020
had a total of 30 characters, but each one cost a buck on, you know, the PlayStation

31:15.020 --> 31:19.860
or, yeah, that would still be stupid, but buying a character for a dollar, not that

31:19.860 --> 31:20.860
bad.

31:20.860 --> 31:26.260
Buying a stupid inanimate object that's $8 and it doesn't do anything, and I saw a lot

31:26.260 --> 31:32.340
of, like, you know, Kotaku, gotta love them, but, you know, one of their excuses is, well,

31:32.340 --> 31:33.500
see, these toys are awesome!

31:33.500 --> 31:37.140
My kids are playing chess with them!

31:37.140 --> 31:38.140
Your kids are weird.

31:38.140 --> 31:39.700
You can play chess with a Dixie Cup.

31:39.700 --> 31:40.700
Exactly!

31:40.700 --> 31:42.300
You can play chess with anything!

31:42.300 --> 31:44.540
You can play chess with the pieces that come with it!

31:44.540 --> 31:45.580
Oh my God!

31:45.580 --> 31:46.580
That's just amazing!

31:46.580 --> 31:53.540
Um, yeah, so, good for you that your kids have found, you know, ways to use your toys

31:53.540 --> 31:59.860
that you got for free from Activision anyways, so congratulations, but it's just, it's seriously

31:59.860 --> 32:04.260
a cash grab, and if it's successful, you can bet that there's gonna be more of this shit

32:04.260 --> 32:05.260
later on.

32:05.260 --> 32:08.940
I don't need another 30 minute opening segment about Skylanders, so can I move on and talk

32:08.940 --> 32:10.260
about the last game of my week?

32:10.260 --> 32:14.980
Let's talk about Cash Grab 2, bargain basement game that's pretty good for your value, and

32:14.980 --> 32:18.540
it's seriously right up the frickin' alley of the people that listen to this show, at

32:18.540 --> 32:21.980
least the ones, you know, that started with us and all that, because it's a music-based

32:21.980 --> 32:22.980
game.

32:22.980 --> 32:26.740
The game I bought this week on Steam, that just went on sale, I believe, over the weekend,

32:26.740 --> 32:34.140
is a game called Sequence, and it is, get this, it's a DDR role-playing game.

32:34.140 --> 32:39.380
It's DDR, but not like the actual DDR game, but it's that whole idea, the falling arrows,

32:39.380 --> 32:44.120
mixed with a role-playing game, and it's $4.50 right now on Steam, which I think the regular

32:44.120 --> 32:45.120
price is gonna be $5.

32:45.120 --> 32:48.540
I also believe, if I remember correctly, it's also an Xbox indie game.

32:48.540 --> 32:49.540
It is.

32:49.540 --> 32:54.540
It's not live indie game, but once the Cthulhu people went over to Steam and were like, shit,

32:54.540 --> 33:00.740
we made more money in a day on Steam, I'm sure Sequence was probably already in negotiations

33:00.740 --> 33:04.940
to get their game on Steam, and fine, because, I don't know, I wanted to play it on my computer,

33:04.940 --> 33:05.940
and I just, I did.

33:05.940 --> 33:06.940
I bought it there.

33:06.940 --> 33:09.340
And so, okay, let me try to explain the setup for you guys.

33:09.340 --> 33:16.420
So imagine if you had three Dance Dance Revolution play fields that you had to play all at once,

33:16.420 --> 33:19.180
and you would use buttons to switch between the play fields.

33:19.180 --> 33:21.500
So Rock Band for the DS or the PSP.

33:21.500 --> 33:26.900
Okay, kind of, I guess you could say, except, like, one won't stop just because you get

33:26.900 --> 33:28.500
a perfect note pattern in one.

33:28.500 --> 33:31.380
One of them is for defending or preventing damage.

33:31.380 --> 33:32.980
One of them is for casting spells.

33:32.980 --> 33:35.440
One of them is for regening mana for your spells.

33:35.440 --> 33:38.940
And the way it all works together, I gotta admit, is really cool.

33:38.940 --> 33:43.140
Like, the whole design of the game is, it's something kinda new.

33:43.140 --> 33:48.020
It's mixing two genres together that I think people are into, and I think for people that

33:48.020 --> 33:52.620
enjoy music games or old playing games, like, you've gotta see what they've done here.

33:52.620 --> 33:56.640
It is a $5 game, and so it has the production values of a $5 game.

33:56.640 --> 34:01.540
Some of the voice acting is a little, leaves some things to be desired.

34:01.540 --> 34:03.900
But the writing is actually, it's very witty.

34:03.900 --> 34:07.700
It's a very witty, you can tell there's a lot of inspiration from, like, GLaDOS.

34:07.700 --> 34:11.220
It's very modern, the game.

34:11.220 --> 34:13.620
So I like kinda what they've done with that.

34:13.620 --> 34:17.140
And it's not that, I'm not, like, criticizing the voice actors, I'm just saying the way

34:17.140 --> 34:21.280
the voice acting is delivered, it really sounds like the two were recorded, like, at least

34:21.280 --> 34:27.100
in the stages I've played, the intercom gal and the main character that you play, it's

34:27.100 --> 34:31.360
kinda obvious the two were recorded separately, because they don't ever talk on top of each

34:31.360 --> 34:32.360
other.

34:32.360 --> 34:34.540
They don't have a natural interaction with each other.

34:34.540 --> 34:38.180
And maybe I'm just kinda picky when it comes to stuff like that, but I just, you know,

34:38.180 --> 34:39.900
I noticed it.

34:39.900 --> 34:43.260
But I'm not gonna say, like, oh my god, the game is, like, worthless because the voice

34:43.260 --> 34:46.180
acting was not done professionally.

34:46.180 --> 34:52.500
No, it's the game itself, it's neat, and it's the kinda thing where I go, I really wanna

34:52.500 --> 34:55.580
see what they're gonna do with this sequel.

34:55.580 --> 34:59.660
Because you know, again, when I say roleplaying game, unfortunately there's no overworld,

34:59.660 --> 35:03.260
there's no map, it's just you kinda choose from a menu.

35:03.260 --> 35:05.340
Do you wanna go out and battle another creature?

35:05.340 --> 35:09.560
Do you wanna work on synthesis to get more items so you are, you know, better defended

35:09.560 --> 35:10.820
and have more hit points?

35:10.820 --> 35:15.940
Or do you wanna work on, you know, what kinda stuff do you wanna do from within this room?

35:15.940 --> 35:19.940
So I feel like with this concept, there's so much more that can be done with it if people

35:19.940 --> 35:22.220
will just throw money at it.

35:22.220 --> 35:27.100
If somebody will invest and get them more help, it'll be great.

35:27.100 --> 35:30.400
So like, sequence two I think will be really cool if they end up making one.

35:30.400 --> 35:32.020
But sequence one is worth your time.

35:32.020 --> 35:35.220
The only other thing I guess I could say that might be a slight bit of a negative is that

35:35.220 --> 35:42.080
the music is not, you know, it's not gonna be DDR style music, but I did like the music.

35:42.080 --> 35:47.780
It's kinda, you know, it's not really like pop music or anything like that.

35:47.780 --> 35:53.620
It's very like video gamey, you know, kinda indie artist type stuff, but it's not bad

35:53.620 --> 35:54.620
by any means.

35:54.620 --> 36:00.420
And you know, because my brain is still preoccupied, I tell you, it takes a lot to like be thinking

36:00.420 --> 36:04.380
in the concept of, okay, I'm playing over here and oh shit, I see an arrow coming down

36:04.380 --> 36:07.380
here on the damage, so I gotta flip over, hit that one, then I gotta go back and hit

36:07.380 --> 36:08.380
my arrows to cast a spell.

36:08.380 --> 36:11.140
I mean, your brain is kinda thinking all these things that you're not really absorbing the

36:11.140 --> 36:12.860
music like you would in DDR.

36:12.860 --> 36:13.860
So I don't know.

36:13.860 --> 36:16.940
But yeah, I really like the setup of the game.

36:16.940 --> 36:20.660
So it's neat and I would check it out if you have 450 to spare.

36:20.660 --> 36:24.500
Sadly, I don't think there's a demo, but there might be on the indie games marketplace.

36:24.500 --> 36:29.580
I would assume there's something there on Xbox Live, but again, I played it on PC.

36:29.580 --> 36:30.740
So check it out.

36:30.740 --> 36:32.660
That's sequence.

36:32.660 --> 36:35.920
Alright, that does it for our gaming weeks.

36:35.920 --> 36:39.620
So I wanna quickly plug a few Orange Lounge Radio related things and that would be our

36:39.620 --> 36:40.620
Facebook.

36:40.620 --> 36:43.300
If you're not our friend on Facebook, why not?

36:43.300 --> 36:44.660
Don't you wanna have another friend?

36:44.660 --> 36:48.860
Orange Lounge Radio, Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio is the place to add us on Facebook.

36:48.860 --> 36:52.260
You can also follow us on the Twitters, Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

36:52.260 --> 36:56.960
We will be taking your Twitter comments a little later on in the show, Twitter.com slash

36:56.960 --> 37:01.340
O-L-R if you wanna send us some app messages with your thoughts on anything, sorry, Loki,

37:01.340 --> 37:04.420
anything you're hearing about on tonight's program.

37:04.420 --> 37:06.700
Let's get into some news.

37:06.700 --> 37:09.240
Loki's gonna start us off tonight.

37:09.240 --> 37:14.580
So the PlayStation Vita's got a release date now for Europe and North America and I guess

37:14.580 --> 37:17.060
the Middle East and Australia.

37:17.060 --> 37:18.060
February 22nd.

37:18.060 --> 37:23.620
It's kinda hot, that's a Wednesday on release date, but yeah.

37:23.620 --> 37:24.620
It'll be coming out.

37:24.620 --> 37:31.940
Of course, they are quick to remind you that it's $249.99 without 3G and $299.99 with 3G.

37:31.940 --> 37:39.700
Honestly, I'd just stick without 3G and tether to my phone if I really want 3G, although

37:39.700 --> 37:41.020
I don't think I'll ever.

37:41.020 --> 37:45.220
But Loki, I must game on the go.

37:45.220 --> 37:48.500
I mean, it's a good idea if you want to do 3G.

37:48.500 --> 37:54.420
I just don't know what the data plans are with that and 3G stuff, you know, have they

37:54.420 --> 37:55.620
really announced?

37:55.620 --> 38:00.860
Is this something where I can take it to any provider that has 3G and say, hey, I want

38:00.860 --> 38:09.100
my PlayStation Vita to run on your service, because this isn't like the iPhone or anything

38:09.100 --> 38:13.900
where hey, certain places will give it to you.

38:13.900 --> 38:16.980
And also, the other thing you might want to wait and see is if they do have some sort

38:16.980 --> 38:22.420
of data plan, a lot of times usually with the iPads and phones and stuff like that,

38:22.420 --> 38:26.380
they'll offer you some sort of discount on the system, so you might want to wait and

38:26.380 --> 38:31.140
see what the providers announce.

38:31.140 --> 38:35.660
Some new launch titles have also been announced, coming from Namco, of course.

38:35.660 --> 38:42.300
Ridge Racer, Ridge Racer, serving the launches of systems since the beginning of time.

38:42.300 --> 38:48.940
Shinobidou and Touch My Katamari.

38:48.940 --> 38:51.900
Those will be coming alongside the Vita in North America.

38:51.900 --> 38:53.300
Touch My Katamari, really?

38:53.300 --> 38:59.900
Yeah, I believe that's actually coming out already, well, obviously the Vita is launching

38:59.900 --> 39:04.780
a little bit earlier in Japan, but I believe it's also with their launch as well.

39:04.780 --> 39:07.500
Is that a bowling minigame I see there?

39:07.500 --> 39:09.820
I don't think it's a minigame, I think it's just bowling pins.

39:09.820 --> 39:11.140
Part of what you roll up?

39:11.140 --> 39:12.140
Roll up.

39:12.140 --> 39:13.140
That's cute.

39:13.140 --> 39:14.700
I like Katamari.

39:14.700 --> 39:16.340
I play that.

39:16.340 --> 39:21.980
Yeah, I mean, the Katamari franchise has been kind of meh ever since the creator left, but

39:21.980 --> 39:28.980
I don't know, you never know, there might always be that Renaissance Katamari game that's

39:28.980 --> 39:30.180
a lot of fun again.

39:30.180 --> 39:33.980
The one on PlayStation 3 wasn't bad, but it was also kind of a rehash of all the old games.

39:33.980 --> 39:36.900
It was like a Best Hits of Katamari.

39:36.900 --> 39:41.860
Knowing Namco, I wouldn't be surprised if this is a rehash of a rehash of a rehash of

39:41.860 --> 39:45.340
a rehash.

39:45.340 --> 39:47.140
So who knows?

39:47.140 --> 39:51.140
But it's kind of neat.

39:51.140 --> 39:52.740
Do you think you're going to get one of these at launch?

39:52.740 --> 39:53.740
I know I am.

39:53.740 --> 39:55.380
I really don't have a choice.

39:55.380 --> 40:00.140
I'd like to, but it all depends on how much money you got, but I think I could probably

40:00.140 --> 40:02.620
scrounge up that kind of dough.

40:02.620 --> 40:05.500
I will definitely be setting the money aside to get it.

40:05.500 --> 40:07.020
I gotta have it.

40:07.020 --> 40:10.540
I just, you know, the reason I want it is because I think they're going to do a Grand

40:10.540 --> 40:15.180
Theft Auto game for it, and I gotta have a Grand Theft Auto game.

40:15.180 --> 40:18.660
Grand Theft Auto on PSP, we were kind of talking about it, especially since they've

40:18.660 --> 40:23.500
been showing the Grand Theft Auto 3 stuff, it's like, man, it'd be fun to go back and

40:23.500 --> 40:30.300
play Liberty City Stories again, but that game is really old, and it would be such a

40:30.300 --> 40:31.980
learning curve again.

40:31.980 --> 40:36.180
Salacious Pop, how do you feel about the PlayStation Vita?

40:36.180 --> 40:40.420
Like, I know you don't exactly probably want to run out and buy one day one, but let's

40:40.420 --> 40:43.260
say you had the disposable income.

40:43.260 --> 40:45.580
Is this something that calls to you?

40:45.580 --> 40:46.580
Absolutely.

40:46.580 --> 40:47.580
It's a sexy piece of hardware.

40:47.580 --> 40:48.580
I like how it looks.

40:48.580 --> 40:52.460
I didn't know you felt so strongly about it.

40:52.460 --> 40:53.460
No, it's like...

40:53.460 --> 40:56.820
Do you have feelings for the PlayStation Vita?

40:56.820 --> 41:02.420
The PSP for me was, I think it's an underrated piece of hardware, because the DS, of course,

41:02.420 --> 41:07.380
just mud stomped everything in the handheld market, and the PSP is a competent little

41:07.380 --> 41:10.340
nice device that displays well and is a great system.

41:10.340 --> 41:16.820
I think the Vita, again, is going to be a nice piece of technology, but the 3DS hasn't

41:16.820 --> 41:19.780
really started to wreck people yet.

41:19.780 --> 41:22.660
Here's the thing about the 3DS, too.

41:22.660 --> 41:28.140
We don't really know, aside from the ever-delayed Kid Icarus, what's really their plan beyond

41:28.140 --> 41:29.380
2011.

41:29.380 --> 41:34.300
It's just like, hey, we got Kid Icarus, because that's been delayed forever.

41:34.300 --> 41:38.940
They've got the two Mario games that are going to be coming out this holiday, but they haven't

41:38.940 --> 41:41.180
really said too much.

41:41.180 --> 41:45.940
There was stuff at E3 and some other conference, but I don't remember any of that damn shit.

41:45.940 --> 41:49.420
So since they're not keeping it fresh in my mind, that makes me think that they don't

41:49.420 --> 41:56.060
really have a plan, and they're really going to need a plan when the Vita comes out, because

41:56.060 --> 41:58.980
people may think otherwise by buying a system.

41:58.980 --> 42:06.500
We do have expansion firmware-related news coming up later, and it's upgrades.

42:06.500 --> 42:08.160
It's upgrades from what's there now.

42:08.160 --> 42:12.860
One thing that I think might keep some people from buying a Vita is that, kind of like the

42:12.860 --> 42:17.380
PSP, it's almost too nice.

42:17.380 --> 42:19.180
Let's say you can afford the price point.

42:19.180 --> 42:22.180
It's such a nice piece of hardware, but it's like, I don't want to put this in my pocket

42:22.180 --> 42:23.900
or carry this around.

42:23.900 --> 42:26.740
This is a nice thing.

42:26.740 --> 42:31.300
If I take it out, it might get scratched or screwed up or something.

42:31.300 --> 42:36.620
A portable device should, I don't want to say look like a toy, but the DS with the plastic

42:36.620 --> 42:40.340
and it's got the clamshell and you close it, it looks like something that you can play

42:40.340 --> 42:41.700
on the bus.

42:41.700 --> 42:44.660
Whereas with the Vita, it's like, ooh, this is a very...

42:44.660 --> 42:46.580
It's begging to get me mugged.

42:46.580 --> 42:47.580
Yeah.

42:47.580 --> 42:52.620
And it's weird that it almost looks too nice of a piece of thing that you want to take

42:52.620 --> 42:53.620
outside the house.

42:53.620 --> 42:54.620
I don't know.

42:54.620 --> 42:59.040
Right now, the launch games, there's not really much been announced because they didn't really

42:59.040 --> 43:00.500
know when the date of the Vita was.

43:00.500 --> 43:04.260
And I know there's maybe four or five games that I actually know that are coming out launch

43:04.260 --> 43:05.260
right now.

43:05.260 --> 43:07.300
Some, I don't even know if they've been announced yet.

43:07.300 --> 43:16.780
But Lego Harry Potter, that's not for me, Army Corps of Hell, that looks pretty cool,

43:16.780 --> 43:24.320
Dragon's Crowned, and well, Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3.

43:24.320 --> 43:28.220
But at least on a point you brought up with Nintendo, we don't really know what they're

43:28.220 --> 43:32.420
doing beyond a year, but with the PlayStation Vita, we know Final Fantasy X is coming at

43:32.420 --> 43:34.540
some point.

43:34.540 --> 43:39.460
And with the Vita, I gotta say, the launch lineup is looking a hell lot better even with

43:39.460 --> 43:44.180
not much announced already than the 3DS launch.

43:44.180 --> 43:47.340
And also with the 3DS, they're still, and this is going to come up later in the show,

43:47.340 --> 43:53.380
there's still that weirdness with that button, that right analog add-on, which is coming

43:53.380 --> 43:56.660
to America, which we're going to bring up later, and does that mean that we're going

43:56.660 --> 43:58.860
to get a new device altogether?

43:58.860 --> 44:00.020
And they're just so awkward.

44:00.020 --> 44:03.380
It's like that awkward friend you don't really want to invite over, but you kind of have

44:03.380 --> 44:05.100
to.

44:05.100 --> 44:09.700
Yeah, so there's a lot in the air right now for the 3DS.

44:09.700 --> 44:13.740
Alright, well let's move on to another big thing that happened this week, of course,

44:13.740 --> 44:14.740
BlizzCon!

44:14.740 --> 44:18.500
And I know not all of you are into the Blizzard stuff, but they do make three pretty big PC

44:18.500 --> 44:21.340
games, I mean, if not the biggest PC games.

44:21.340 --> 44:25.780
Collectively they are Warcraft, Starcraft, and Diablo, and there was news about all those

44:25.780 --> 44:27.700
games at BlizzCon this week.

44:27.700 --> 44:32.820
But of course, the huge huge MMO, World of Warcraft, had a new expansion announced.

44:32.820 --> 44:35.540
It's the Mists of Pandaria.

44:35.540 --> 44:40.540
This was the name that had earlier been rumored thanks to a trademark filing earlier in the

44:40.540 --> 44:44.980
year, but it was confirmed that the Pandarens, yes, that's panda people, will be the new

44:44.980 --> 44:48.700
playable race in WoW for both the Alliance and the Horde.

44:48.700 --> 44:51.700
You're going to be choosing at level 10 which side you're going to go on.

44:51.700 --> 44:52.700
So that's the first race.

44:52.700 --> 44:56.660
So they're going to finally add, like, you know, slash Panda Express now?

44:56.660 --> 45:01.280
No, but apparently there's some type of achievement that you get called Panda Express when you

45:01.280 --> 45:05.300
do, like, 100 of those rolls, because the rolls make you run faster, and I'm just thinking

45:05.300 --> 45:06.300
like...

45:06.300 --> 45:07.300
They get a rolly polly tumble.

45:07.300 --> 45:10.240
Well, it makes sense, because I know whenever I eat Panda Express I've got to run really

45:10.240 --> 45:12.540
fast to the bathroom, so it makes sense.

45:12.540 --> 45:14.260
Womp womp.

45:14.260 --> 45:20.900
Also coming in the expansion, the Monk class, the level cap is raised to level 90, some

45:20.900 --> 45:25.300
brand new end game things to participate in, a dungeon challenge mode where your item levels

45:25.300 --> 45:29.500
will be capped, and you're going to go after gold, silver, and bronze medals in the various

45:29.500 --> 45:30.500
dungeons in the game.

45:30.500 --> 45:31.500
That actually sounds really cool.

45:31.500 --> 45:33.580
I'm going to be very interested in that.

45:33.580 --> 45:35.020
PvE scenarios.

45:35.020 --> 45:39.980
For people that like the big PvP battlegrounds without their PvP, is basically what it sounds

45:39.980 --> 45:44.940
like, and a new pet battle system that is basically Pokemon.

45:44.940 --> 45:50.380
Blizzard has realized that a lot of people really like the pet collecting aspect of the

45:50.380 --> 45:53.900
game, so they're expanding this whole new mini-game into it now where you're going to

45:53.900 --> 45:56.340
have a Pokemon battle system.

45:56.340 --> 46:01.060
Basically you're going to have different talents on your pets, and your pets can use three

46:01.060 --> 46:06.020
of them at a time, and they battle each other, and you can even go around the world and fight

46:06.020 --> 46:09.100
master trainers to get new abilities.

46:09.100 --> 46:12.820
They are not even being shy about what they're riving off here.

46:12.820 --> 46:15.140
If Nintendo ain't going to do it, then...

46:15.140 --> 46:16.140
Right.

46:16.140 --> 46:20.780
And my main has, she's got like 110 little critters on her, so I'm ready to go.

46:20.780 --> 46:21.780
I'm excited.

46:21.780 --> 46:22.780
I want to check it out.

46:22.780 --> 46:26.140
I'm excited to see how some of the critters are going to battle, because for the new

46:26.140 --> 46:29.380
Halloween event this year, there's a pet that you can get very easy.

46:29.380 --> 46:31.040
It's just a fucking box.

46:31.040 --> 46:35.140
It's a cardboard box that follows you, but then once in a while, a little tongue will

46:35.140 --> 46:36.620
jump out of the box.

46:36.620 --> 46:39.140
Supposedly it eats one of the other pets.

46:39.140 --> 46:43.420
For Stephen King fans, if you've seen the movie Creepshow, and I know you don't like

46:43.420 --> 46:45.520
horror, it's the monster in the crate.

46:45.520 --> 46:49.100
It's the creepy crate from Creepshow, that 80s movie is what it is.

46:49.100 --> 46:50.100
Oh, okay.

46:50.100 --> 46:52.100
I got you.

46:52.100 --> 46:57.820
Also, apparently there's going to be pets that you can only find out in the world, like

46:57.820 --> 47:01.200
at certain times of day, or during the spring.

47:01.200 --> 47:05.020
I mean, wasn't that the kicker in the last Pokemon game on the DS?

47:05.020 --> 47:07.420
Like there was Pokemon you can only catch at certain times of day and stuff?

47:07.420 --> 47:08.740
So, I mean...

47:08.740 --> 47:11.820
If only there were a way to change the time on my DS.

47:11.820 --> 47:13.700
Oh, oh wait.

47:13.700 --> 47:18.180
Except, now you can't change the time on the Blizzard server, so it's going to be interesting

47:18.180 --> 47:19.180
to see.

47:19.180 --> 47:23.220
I've already seen some people trolling that this is just going to be like the dance studio.

47:23.220 --> 47:26.340
They're showing us screen caps now, but it's never going to happen.

47:26.340 --> 47:31.500
I think it will, because what I'm liking about this expansion, I could care less about the

47:31.500 --> 47:32.500
panda or the...

47:32.500 --> 47:36.940
Well, the monk sounds interesting, I'll try a monk, but panda people, whatever, I'm over

47:36.940 --> 47:37.940
it.

47:37.940 --> 47:42.860
But as somebody who doesn't always get a chance to raid because I'm in more of a social guild

47:42.860 --> 47:47.820
where I really just want to be with my friends, but I could see a group of about five people

47:47.820 --> 47:51.180
in that guild getting really into this stupid pet battle thing.

47:51.180 --> 47:56.700
So I like that it's giving people something else to do besides dungeons and raids.

47:56.700 --> 47:58.740
And for that, I give them credit.

47:58.740 --> 48:04.980
Yeah, they've really buffed up stuff for casual players and also PVP is getting entirely new

48:04.980 --> 48:05.980
game concepts.

48:05.980 --> 48:06.980
Murderball.

48:06.980 --> 48:08.700
Murderball and a bunch of other stuff.

48:08.700 --> 48:13.760
Maybe they should add it to Final Fantasy XIV since there's a lot of waiting for party.

48:13.760 --> 48:14.760
You're funny.

48:14.760 --> 48:15.760
All right.

48:15.760 --> 48:21.060
So anyhow, that's pretty much all the big news with World of Warcraft, except one other

48:21.060 --> 48:22.060
thing, right?

48:22.060 --> 48:23.060
SalaciousPop?

48:23.060 --> 48:25.260
Is that me or is it Loki?

48:25.260 --> 48:26.260
No, that's you.

48:26.260 --> 48:27.260
All right.

48:27.260 --> 48:28.260
All right.

48:28.260 --> 48:29.260
Okay.

48:29.260 --> 48:32.840
So World of Warcraft at one time had 12 million subscribers, right?

48:32.840 --> 48:34.460
Top MMO in the world.

48:34.460 --> 48:39.980
Well, Blizzard has another game coming out called Diablo III and they have this promotion

48:39.980 --> 48:44.520
where it's like, all right, how can we do some damage control on the fact that we're

48:44.520 --> 48:48.900
hemorrhaging subscriptions and also maybe cross pollinate our WoW audience with Diablo

48:48.900 --> 48:49.900
III?

48:49.900 --> 48:54.980
And what they've come up with is if you have a WoW license on your battle.net account as

48:54.980 --> 48:59.860
of October 18th, so it's already too late to buy a new WoW license for this.

48:59.860 --> 49:02.020
So this is somewhat of a loyalty program.

49:02.020 --> 49:05.380
Yeah, it's pretty much damage controlled.

49:05.380 --> 49:12.060
You agree to a year of WoW billed at the regular $14.99 every 30 days.

49:12.060 --> 49:14.920
You're just saying that you're going to do that for 12 months out.

49:14.920 --> 49:19.140
You're going to get a free digital download license of Diablo III.

49:19.140 --> 49:24.200
You're going to get access to the Mists of Pandaria beta, probably the very last stage

49:24.200 --> 49:26.460
of it after the...

49:26.460 --> 49:28.020
Everyone who signs up gets to play anyway.

49:28.020 --> 49:32.860
Like after they do friends and family and after the NDA has been lifted.

49:32.860 --> 49:37.540
And you get a Diablo themed, pretty badass looking mount for your WoW account in World

49:37.540 --> 49:39.660
of Warcraft.

49:39.660 --> 49:43.600
So yeah, there are some conditions obviously you need to have WoW on your battle.net account

49:43.600 --> 49:45.820
as of last Wednesday.

49:45.820 --> 49:48.180
If you...

49:48.180 --> 49:53.900
In the terms and conditions of the agreement, if you, for whatever reason, your credit card

49:53.900 --> 49:59.740
stops working and you don't make your payments, I believe they can pull the Diablo III license

49:59.740 --> 50:03.820
from your battle.net account simply because you have to log in to battle.net because of

50:03.820 --> 50:06.020
the real ID and stuff when you play Diablo III.

50:06.020 --> 50:09.000
And Diablo III is very controversial because it's going to be online only.

50:09.000 --> 50:13.940
And now we see another reason why.

50:13.940 --> 50:18.080
Which to fuel all that anger that people had before about they can't play Diablo III offline,

50:18.080 --> 50:19.700
now here's another reason why.

50:19.700 --> 50:22.060
Because these people that are going to get the game for free, they're going to need to

50:22.060 --> 50:24.620
connect every time to make sure their credit cards didn't bounce.

50:24.620 --> 50:28.020
And just to reiterate, if you sign up for this loyalty agreement, your cancel button

50:28.020 --> 50:29.060
is greyed out.

50:29.060 --> 50:31.460
You can't cancel.

50:31.460 --> 50:35.560
It's a cell phone contract in video games.

50:35.560 --> 50:40.220
And the timing can't be better because if you do this, because obviously hell yeah people

50:40.220 --> 50:44.900
want Diablo III, it's going to be one of the biggest games of either next year probably.

50:44.900 --> 50:51.300
You know, we've got Star Wars, MMO of the Old Republic coming out, Guild Wars 2, and

50:51.300 --> 50:54.500
whatever else, they're saying you can go play those games if you want but you're paying

50:54.500 --> 51:00.380
for wow for a year regardless so you can have fun, we got your money.

51:00.380 --> 51:05.000
It's actually, when all is said and done, as kind of evil as it sounds, it's genius.

51:05.000 --> 51:09.060
It's absolute genius on Blizzard's part, is to lock people in.

51:09.060 --> 51:13.220
Lock in your loyal customers that are going to say, shit, I'm going to play wow for the

51:13.220 --> 51:15.940
next year anyway and you're going to give me Diablo III free?

51:15.940 --> 51:17.220
Fuck yeah, I'm in.

51:17.220 --> 51:22.100
But now you can't make flirty eyes with Star Wars, MMO, and you can't go off and cheat

51:22.100 --> 51:23.100
with Guild Wars 2.

51:23.100 --> 51:24.980
You can, you're paying for both.

51:24.980 --> 51:27.020
But yeah, Blizzard will still have your money.

51:27.020 --> 51:30.240
You're not going to be tempted to cut wow for the other.

51:30.240 --> 51:33.580
And that's I think part of the reason why they're also saying well it's like a loyalty

51:33.580 --> 51:34.580
thing.

51:34.580 --> 51:35.700
You can't already be a customer.

51:35.700 --> 51:39.100
This is to lock those 11 million people in, best they can.

51:39.100 --> 51:43.580
Yeah, so if you already have a relationship with wow and you're on the fence as to how

51:43.580 --> 51:47.820
long you're going to be with wow, this is to basically say, you know, pony up, we're

51:47.820 --> 51:50.440
going to keep you and this is how we're going to do it.

51:50.440 --> 51:54.700
This isn't for people that have been thinking about trying out wow.

51:54.700 --> 51:58.140
Like this isn't a way to hop on both trains.

51:58.140 --> 52:00.980
You know what's interesting about this too is that, and I don't even know if this got

52:00.980 --> 52:04.540
brought up on the other show when we were talking about it, but you know, um, yeah,

52:04.540 --> 52:08.020
you're going to get Diablo 3 free, but what else is going to come out while you're locked

52:08.020 --> 52:14.140
into this 12 year or 12 month, not 12 year, 12 month, uh, plan Mr. Pandaria.

52:14.140 --> 52:18.180
So if you really want the full wow experience that you've now committed to, you're going

52:18.180 --> 52:20.780
to have to get Mr. Pandaria.

52:20.780 --> 52:23.900
So you may not have to buy Diablo 3, but you're going to have to buy the other game.

52:23.900 --> 52:29.420
I mean, I guess you don't have to, but you know that they're thinking everybody's going

52:29.420 --> 52:32.260
to that's locked in if they're locked into their wow account.

52:32.260 --> 52:36.900
For the previous wow expansion, Wrath of the Lich King, a lot of people killed the Lich

52:36.900 --> 52:40.740
King, which was the end boss supreme raid boss of that expansion.

52:40.740 --> 52:45.400
And then they canceled their wow all through the summer and they didn't sign up for until

52:45.400 --> 52:46.660
Cataclysm came out in December.

52:46.660 --> 52:48.860
So they got to save money by just saying, I'm going to be back.

52:48.860 --> 52:50.240
I'm just taking five months off.

52:50.240 --> 52:52.080
You can't really do that with this, right?

52:52.080 --> 52:55.060
You can't, you know, we killed Deathwing and Cataclysm.

52:55.060 --> 52:59.500
You can't quit and come back from Mr. Pandaria if you're paying for this promotion.

52:59.500 --> 53:02.780
I want to clarify because some folks in chat are talking about how the payment works.

53:02.780 --> 53:03.880
Here's the deal.

53:03.880 --> 53:07.860
You're not agreeing to any type of payment plan with this.

53:07.860 --> 53:10.800
You're agreeing to keep your account current for 12 months.

53:10.800 --> 53:14.340
You can still pay with the cards, the prepaid cards.

53:14.340 --> 53:16.940
So if you never want to give Blizzard your credit card, apparently you still don't have

53:16.940 --> 53:17.940
to.

53:17.940 --> 53:19.700
You can use the prepaid cards.

53:19.700 --> 53:23.140
But the other thing is, is that, well, I'm assuming though you have to still have a credit

53:23.140 --> 53:27.980
card on file, but so I don't know if you could really, but my understanding is that it can

53:27.980 --> 53:30.620
use the prepaid cards and when you sign up for it.

53:30.620 --> 53:35.100
And I, I did it last night because let's do the lump sum.

53:35.100 --> 53:37.620
We can't, you can't do a 12 month lump sum.

53:37.620 --> 53:41.100
I know people are thinking that or that you have to pay that upfront, but you can't do

53:41.100 --> 53:42.100
12.

53:42.100 --> 53:44.660
It's the same payment methods that were always there.

53:44.660 --> 53:47.520
You can do one month at 1499 a month.

53:47.520 --> 53:52.780
You can do three month lump sum at 1399 a month, or you can do what I did the six month

53:52.780 --> 53:55.300
lump sum at 1299 a month.

53:55.300 --> 53:59.900
And I know, so this month I'll have to pay $77, which is going to be six months a while,

53:59.900 --> 54:02.860
which I know I'm going to be playing anyway because I have the other show.

54:02.860 --> 54:08.200
And then in April, around the time I get my tax refund, I'll have to pay the other $77

54:08.200 --> 54:09.400
and then I'll be good for the year.

54:09.400 --> 54:11.140
So I kind of figure it'll work.

54:11.140 --> 54:15.060
Yeah, that, that's good because I was on the three month plan cause 40 bucks, you know,

54:15.060 --> 54:19.180
once a quarter is reasonable and it's a dollar off what you'd be paying monthly.

54:19.180 --> 54:23.620
I thought that you had to roll over to 1499 every 30 days with this promotion, so it's

54:23.620 --> 54:28.200
great to hear that you can, you do not, you can pick what you can still do the three months,

54:28.200 --> 54:32.800
but I think you have to have some type of recurring thing on file, but if you end up

54:32.800 --> 54:35.600
using the prepaid cards, then you're fine.

54:35.600 --> 54:38.700
It'll just keep, you know, you'll never get charged cause you keep stocking up with prepaid

54:38.700 --> 54:43.500
cards, but obviously they're going to, if they're going to give you a $50 game for free,

54:43.500 --> 54:46.400
they want to make sure that you're going to make good on your promise.

54:46.400 --> 54:49.980
You know, because I don't see blizzard sending bill collectors after people if they don't

54:49.980 --> 54:50.980
make good on their payments.

54:50.980 --> 54:54.720
Well, what if you get Diablo three through this promotion and then you make IRL money

54:54.720 --> 54:56.520
with the new Diablo three auction house thing?

54:56.520 --> 54:59.880
We'll shut that shit down if you don't, if you don't make good on your payments and something

54:59.880 --> 55:00.880
you think about.

55:00.880 --> 55:04.040
And what I really want to come to this, like I know some of you could give a shit about

55:04.040 --> 55:09.680
wow and Diablo and all that stuff like, like Loki probably doesn't really, but here's what

55:09.680 --> 55:13.700
I do want to say with this and Loki where I can get your opinion is that now that blizzard

55:13.700 --> 55:19.320
has thrown that idea out there precedent has been set precedent has been set.

55:19.320 --> 55:20.320
Imagine it.

55:20.320 --> 55:31.700
Loki next year, sign up for a year of Xbox live and get free halo maps, woo PlayStation

55:31.700 --> 55:34.160
plus to an extent is somewhat like this.

55:34.160 --> 55:37.920
I give you free games, but the minute you stopped paying for PlayStation plus they're

55:37.920 --> 55:38.920
gone.

55:38.920 --> 55:41.200
Yeah, I could see that.

55:41.200 --> 55:45.620
I mean I already paid for live so I don't really care.

55:45.620 --> 55:49.560
I mean that's just my thing cause I do play online every day.

55:49.560 --> 55:51.520
Well almost every day.

55:51.520 --> 55:55.880
So it's not like you can go without it.

55:55.880 --> 55:59.580
And they already and it's already, I already renew a year or year prepaid every time.

55:59.580 --> 56:04.840
So yeah, that's cool if you want to give me some more free shit on top of that, cool.

56:04.840 --> 56:09.640
I probably don't give a crap about it, especially if it's halo maps or even halo a game.

56:09.640 --> 56:13.080
You know, I don't care.

56:13.080 --> 56:16.460
I got to say though, I mean I know there's a lot of chatter on the internet and a lot

56:16.460 --> 56:21.200
of people and of course a lot of cynical ness about this and I understand it is, you know,

56:21.200 --> 56:26.460
I have to admit I did have a big hesitation about doing this because it's signing a contract

56:26.460 --> 56:27.540
with a video game company.

56:27.540 --> 56:28.800
That's a little weird to me.

56:28.800 --> 56:29.960
It's really weird.

56:29.960 --> 56:34.500
But at the end of the day I realized, look, I'm going to pay for this game for a year.

56:34.500 --> 56:35.500
I know I'm going to be doing this.

56:35.500 --> 56:38.580
I have the other show and it's not going anywhere anytime soon.

56:38.580 --> 56:40.320
And I know I'm buying Diablo three.

56:40.320 --> 56:42.060
Like I know I'm buying, I'm in the beta right now.

56:42.060 --> 56:43.060
I love it.

56:43.060 --> 56:44.280
I, it's, I need more of it.

56:44.280 --> 56:45.720
I'm going to buy Diablo three.

56:45.720 --> 56:47.280
So for me, this is great.

56:47.280 --> 56:48.480
It's not for everybody.

56:48.480 --> 56:50.320
This deal is not for everybody.

56:50.320 --> 56:55.060
In fact, if most people that are probably making fun of this probably aren't even eligible

56:55.060 --> 56:58.500
for it anyway because you have to be a current wow subscriber.

56:58.500 --> 56:59.720
So this isn't for everybody.

56:59.720 --> 57:02.640
This is just Blizzard's way of making sure you're going to stay loyal.

57:02.640 --> 57:05.400
And if you dealt, they'll give you a little something extra.

57:05.400 --> 57:08.760
I mean, at the end of the day, I said, you know what, I'm going to end up paying for

57:08.760 --> 57:09.760
a while anyway.

57:09.760 --> 57:12.840
And I know it, I might as well get Diablo three free.

57:12.840 --> 57:15.840
By the way, and there's another, isn't there, isn't there something a little less on this

57:15.840 --> 57:16.840
too?

57:16.840 --> 57:17.840
Yeah.

57:17.840 --> 57:21.520
I was going to mention, um, Blizzard always puts out very sexy collector's editions, whether

57:21.520 --> 57:24.240
it be for a wow expansion or for Starcraft or whatever.

57:24.240 --> 57:28.640
Um, so of course Diablo three collector's edition is going to have some nice swag in

57:28.640 --> 57:29.640
it.

57:29.640 --> 57:34.840
Some bonus stuff, namely a, um, the big one is going to be a USB drive with a little Diablo

57:34.840 --> 57:37.280
skull caddy that you can put the drive in.

57:37.280 --> 57:42.120
And on that drive is Diablo two, and I believe it's expansion, at least I would hope so that

57:42.120 --> 57:45.160
you can then install off the USB drive or play off the USB drive.

57:45.160 --> 57:50.700
Um, you're going to get the wow mount that you would also get for doing this, um, annual

57:50.700 --> 57:53.840
subscription with the free copy if you're an existing well, so you get the mount.

57:53.840 --> 57:58.400
Um, but also if you're thinking, well, I want to do this 12 month promotion and get the

57:58.400 --> 58:00.720
game for free, but that's the standard edition.

58:00.720 --> 58:05.440
If I go to fries or Best Buy and I'm going to drop 80 bucks for this hella Diablo three

58:05.440 --> 58:09.160
box edition, cause it's bad-ass, that's going to screw me over for the promotion.

58:09.160 --> 58:14.280
Um, what's going to happen is, is if you apply that collector's edition code to your battle.net

58:14.280 --> 58:18.920
account with the 12 month promotion thing on it, you're, they're going to add four months

58:18.920 --> 58:20.960
free to your wow subscription.

58:20.960 --> 58:25.840
So you are going to make up that money somehow and in lieu of more wow, more wow, pay 12

58:25.840 --> 58:27.320
months a while, get more wow.

58:27.320 --> 58:28.800
So there you go.

58:28.800 --> 58:29.800
All right.

58:29.800 --> 58:32.520
So anyhow, I don't want to dwell too much on this, but you know, again, I think the

58:32.520 --> 58:40.600
precedent here, don't be surprised if Activision, the parent company, isn't looking at this

58:40.600 --> 58:45.920
going, Hmm, how could we sell more Skylanders dolls by getting people to commit?

58:45.920 --> 58:49.080
How much do you love your Skylanders?

58:49.080 --> 58:50.080
We'll see.

58:50.080 --> 58:54.440
I just, I don't know if it would really work with anything other than a, you know, subscription

58:54.440 --> 58:59.640
service like, you know, cause they kind of already do that with Call of Duty elite.

58:59.640 --> 59:02.460
You would, so either it's a one year fee.

59:02.460 --> 59:07.040
It's not like, Hey, at the sign of contract, it's, yeah, we just have one fee.

59:07.040 --> 59:11.760
So I don't know, it would just, it would have to put out more MMOs over to imagine.

59:11.760 --> 59:12.760
All right.

59:12.760 --> 59:14.840
Well, let's move on with some more gaming news.

59:14.840 --> 59:15.840
Loki.

59:15.840 --> 59:24.920
So, uh, so some non wow related stuff, um, we can talk a little bit about a game.

59:24.920 --> 59:28.720
I used to play a lot in the arcade since we were talking about arcades a little bit ago,

59:28.720 --> 59:29.960
NFL blitz.

59:29.960 --> 59:30.960
It's coming back.

59:30.960 --> 59:31.960
Yeah.

59:31.960 --> 59:36.160
Hey, remember Midway used to put it out and then Midway went under and then, you know,

59:36.160 --> 59:44.600
they tried re, you know, booting it or whatever and then quite work out too well.

59:44.600 --> 59:47.440
So now of course it's called NFL blitz.

59:47.440 --> 59:48.440
So who has it?

59:48.440 --> 59:56.380
Of course, EA, because they have the NFL license and a EA, we'll be putting that out in 2012.

59:56.380 --> 01:00:02.240
It's going to be, uh, put out by EA Tiberian and uh, it's kind of neat.

01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:07.360
They've got a pretty much the same gameplay style as before, plus a little bit of like

01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:10.440
a Madden flare thrown in there.

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:16.720
And um, I guess they also say that you have a currency system called blitz bucks where

01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:24.280
you can boost, uh, your teams and modify them in a bunch of different ways as well as, um,

01:00:24.280 --> 01:00:28.840
custom modes and loading screens, stat boosting type stuff.

01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:32.480
And um, also custom rosters.

01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:37.560
You can set up a survival mode, uh, called a blitz gauntlet.

01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:42.440
And I guess that's where you take on several teams, um, back to back.

01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:45.920
And then also they have a online gameplay as well.

01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:47.160
So that should be pretty big.

01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:48.160
Yeah.

01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:53.760
I have to admit, you know, again, I'm not super into sports games, but if I was into

01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:57.600
a game that was like football, it would be NFL blitz.

01:00:57.600 --> 01:01:00.120
And I like the arcade sports games.

01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:01.120
It's not too big of a surprise.

01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:02.120
I mean, come on.

01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:03.120
They have NBA jams.

01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:11.460
So yeah, and apparently from another article that I read, um, it actually got leaked out

01:01:11.460 --> 01:01:16.080
by somebody a while back, but it was just kind of one of those, an industry insider

01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:21.440
says this and you know, they didn't really have much, you know, to back it up, but it

01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:23.920
did leak out a while back.

01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:24.920
Yeah.

01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:27.840
I was going to say they did a really good job keeping it a secret.

01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:34.360
I mean, there was one story I think somewhere, but you know, with a series like NFL blitz,

01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:37.940
there's always going to be a rumor, especially, you know, we all know midway shut down.

01:01:37.940 --> 01:01:40.760
We all know their assets were sold off, including the IPs.

01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:43.520
It was just a matter of time before it showed up.

01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:44.520
Right.

01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:45.520
Yeah.

01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:50.040
So, so hit stun in chat asks, so the Madden developers are making NFL blitz now.

01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:55.480
Kinda, I mean, it's not the same team, but it's same building pretty much.

01:01:55.480 --> 01:01:56.480
Right.

01:01:56.480 --> 01:01:57.480
Yeah.

01:01:57.480 --> 01:01:58.480
Just down the hall from each other.

01:01:58.480 --> 01:01:59.480
Right.

01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:00.480
Yeah.

01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:03.160
Well, it's not a big surprise cause they've, they've done like some different things before.

01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:11.200
Like they've tried that, uh, like there was a, uh, NFL game that they put out a while

01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:12.200
back.

01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:16.200
Well, they had NFL street and that's kind of been in sore hit and miss.

01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:22.320
And then they had, uh, some NFL game, I think it was like, uh, all pro or something like

01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:23.320
that.

01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:27.880
You know, that was the, uh, uh, two K one, but they had another NFL game that was more

01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:31.440
arcadey, a little bit like arena football almost.

01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:34.200
And well, they had an arena football game at one time even.

01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:40.800
Um, but yeah, they, they, they like to experiment with that type of stuff.

01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:44.200
And really, you know, what they should get on the bandwagon for is rugby games because

01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:49.680
this year is the year of rugby games and they did have a rugby game back in 06, but it's

01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:50.680
been a while.

01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:51.680
All right.

01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:55.000
Let's move on with some more information about final fantasy 14.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.440
You know, we've been talking about it a little bit on the show.

01:02:57.440 --> 01:03:00.640
There's going to be a lot of change coming to that game next year and it's almost, it's,

01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:01.880
it's a little bit unprecedented.

01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:06.160
You know, we've never really had a MMO where at least that I can think of, maybe there's

01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:10.160
no one, but we never really had one where it landed with such a thud that the developers

01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:14.520
are like, we're going to reboot the whole damn game and make it a success.

01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:19.840
Well, uh, now Kiyoshita, who is the producer and director of Final Fantasy 14 has come

01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:25.400
out and said they are considering Vita and smartphone support for Final Fantasy 14.

01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:33.320
Uh, the quote from the, uh, interview, I believe, which was with VG 24 seven, uh, said, quote,

01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:35.440
not just the Vita, but also smartphones.

01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:37.420
So that kind of access will be allowed.

01:03:37.420 --> 01:03:41.640
That will open the door to things like applications that people can use to check their inventory

01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:44.840
or check the market and purchase things from the auctions.

01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:48.520
So it kind of sounds like what wow kind of already does, but maybe a little something

01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:49.520
extra.

01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:53.200
I mean, who knows what could come with this, by the way, they are also still speaking with

01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:58.120
Microsoft about an Xbox 360 version, but they are focusing on a PlayStation three version

01:03:58.120 --> 01:04:01.840
right now saying that basically they promised they were going to make a PlayStation three

01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:02.980
version version.

01:04:02.980 --> 01:04:05.420
They haven't kept it and they need to fulfill it.

01:04:05.420 --> 01:04:09.240
But I think at this point it's probably a good thing that they wait until 2.0 is done

01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:11.220
until they launch it on the PlayStation three.

01:04:11.220 --> 01:04:16.240
And seriously, my God, Microsoft needs to get on the ball with, you know, allowing MMOs

01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:19.660
onto their, uh, their service.

01:04:19.660 --> 01:04:25.040
So, um, it'll be interesting to see if that ends up actually happening or maybe who knows

01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:29.400
for the next Xbox system, you know, Final Fantasy 11 was one of the early, early titles for

01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:30.400
the Xbox 360.

01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:31.400
So you never know.

01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:33.080
It might end up going onto the next.

01:04:33.080 --> 01:04:35.760
And that didn't need, uh, XP gold.

01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:36.760
Did it?

01:04:36.760 --> 01:04:37.760
No.

01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:42.040
11 is really unlike any other 360 game because if you think about it, play online as a joint

01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:46.000
venture with Sony, you've got a Sony game on a, and that was their biller rider, their

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.000
membership thing.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:48.000
Yeah.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.000
Now 14 doesn't use that.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:54.360
It's a, it's all kind of separate, but Final Fantasy 11 is really unlike anything else

01:04:54.360 --> 01:04:55.400
on the 360.

01:04:55.400 --> 01:05:00.120
And I think Microsoft really bent all the rules to get that game on their console because

01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:02.720
you know, it was, it was early on, it was a launch.

01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:04.760
And I got to say, cause I did play 11 back in the day.

01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:05.760
It was pretty awesome on the 360.

01:05:05.760 --> 01:05:09.840
Like if you had the keyboard and everything for it, it was a great way to play the game.

01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:14.600
So, and I was talking to you about this last night, but, uh, luckily for Final Fantasy

01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:20.580
14, it's a gorgeous enough game that if it takes them another year or two to get their

01:05:20.580 --> 01:05:25.240
shit together, considering how wow is seven years old and is finally starting to show

01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:32.240
its age visually, it's a pretty enough a game that it will still be relevant by the time

01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:33.600
they fix it.

01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:34.600
Yeah.

01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:39.000
So, I mean, the other thing I, with the whole PlayStation three launch of 2.0, I wanted

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:43.120
to kind of reiterate is that remember when Final Fantasy 11 came out in America, we got

01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:47.160
version 2.0 of the game was the launch of the game to us because the rise of the Zillart

01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:49.960
expansion was included when that game launched here.

01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:53.720
So we never saw the earliest version of that game, which also I guess was kind of buggy.

01:05:53.720 --> 01:05:57.880
So I don't know, it's going to be interesting to see what happens, but don't expect me to

01:05:57.880 --> 01:06:00.080
pay for the game for a year to find out.

01:06:00.080 --> 01:06:02.600
That's, that's my big thing.

01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:03.600
So we'll see.

01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:10.560
Um, speaking of MMOs, uh, we get another question in our chat room from, uh, did I get away

01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:11.560
ZHEB?

01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:12.560
Z-H-E?

01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:13.560
Z-H-E?

01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:14.560
I can't pronounce this.

01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:15.560
ZHSB, I think it is.

01:06:15.560 --> 01:06:19.560
You're going to make them spell it out again.

01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:24.960
Yeah, ZHSB in chat says, do you think Guild Wars two will end up being higher quality

01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:25.960
than wow?

01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:29.720
I know it won't be a wow killer, but I'm still curious to see what you think.

01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:35.720
Guild Wars strength will always be its model and the fact that once you buy the game, there

01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:37.040
is no monthly fee.

01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:41.220
And that is so alluring to a lot of people that don't want to play wow, you know, because

01:06:41.220 --> 01:06:42.220
of that whole thing.

01:06:42.220 --> 01:06:46.120
And that's what makes Final Fantasy 14 good right now is that it's the same model essentially

01:06:46.120 --> 01:06:47.720
because they're not charging for monthly fee.

01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:51.920
Uh, Guild Wars two looks great, but I can't tell you anything else until I can really

01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:53.040
get my hands on it.

01:06:53.040 --> 01:06:56.840
It's one thing to see the demos on YouTube and I gotta say it looks sexy as hell.

01:06:56.840 --> 01:06:57.840
The graphics look great.

01:06:57.840 --> 01:07:03.440
I'm really excited, but again, I got to get my hands on it until I can really tell you

01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:04.840
if it's going to be worth it or not.

01:07:04.840 --> 01:07:06.240
So next year we'll see.

01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:09.880
So, all right, let's move on.

01:07:09.880 --> 01:07:13.920
More stories, Slicey Pop.

01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:19.080
So of course we all remember back in April when it was the week that Portal two and Mortal

01:07:19.080 --> 01:07:23.280
Kombat came out that PlayStation network was hacked and everyone was very sad and it was

01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:26.740
very end of the world.

01:07:26.740 --> 01:07:34.960
And as a result, when all these gaming journalism sites were like, well, how can you avoid having

01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:39.260
your credit cards saved to these servers if they're going to get compromised so often?

01:07:39.260 --> 01:07:43.560
And one of the solutions was to buy game codes.

01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:48.640
I know if you go into GameStop, you'll see a whole wall of basically these kind of look

01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:54.080
like gift cards at the supermarket where you're just buying the code.

01:07:54.080 --> 01:07:56.120
You're paying obviously the retailer for that.

01:07:56.120 --> 01:08:00.600
You take the code, you load it into your PS3 and you're downloading the game directly without

01:08:00.600 --> 01:08:05.360
having to put a credit card, put points into your PSN bucket and all that stuff.

01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:09.640
One of the ways to get these codes was through Amazon.

01:08:09.640 --> 01:08:12.600
You could buy these cards through Amazon directly.

01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:17.040
Or I think maybe they just emailed a code to you and it was a way to get around Sony's

01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:22.120
shopping cart and if you're worried about having your credit card information stolen

01:08:22.120 --> 01:08:29.400
because Amazon I think is a more reputable retailer, well, those PSN stores, primarily

01:08:29.400 --> 01:08:32.600
the ones on Amazon, all that content has been removed.

01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:34.400
You cannot do that anymore.

01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:38.440
So for all the people that were using Amazon to get around PSN.

01:08:38.440 --> 01:08:41.160
Which was a lot more people after the hacks, I'm sure.

01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:42.160
Yeah.

01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:43.160
After that whole end of the world thing.

01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:47.520
And we still haven't heard, I don't think, about anybody really getting screwed over.

01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:48.520
Meanwhile on Xbox.

01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:49.520
Yeah.

01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:50.520
Meanwhile on Xbox Live.

01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:55.520
Who by the way got hacked this week, another friend of mine, just saying.

01:08:55.520 --> 01:09:00.760
So Amazon has confirmed the removal of the content and they have no announcements regarding

01:09:00.760 --> 01:09:04.680
this change in selection so they're being kind of hush-hush about it.

01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:09.080
I believe Sony has been nudged to their PR saying, what's up with Amazon?

01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:12.160
Why'd they drop your stuff?

01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:13.880
Sony hasn't responded yet.

01:09:13.880 --> 01:09:14.880
Interesting.

01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:15.880
So.

01:09:15.880 --> 01:09:20.040
They could be, they might be just not happy with the fact that, what was it, they found

01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:25.600
out that it was like some Amazon servers that were used to hack the Playstation network or

01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:26.600
whatever like that.

01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:32.160
Oh yeah, it was through like one of their S3 data, like web hosting accounts or something.

01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:33.160
Yeah.

01:09:33.160 --> 01:09:37.600
I doubt that has anything to do with it but more of that they want more control over that

01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:38.600
stuff.

01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:44.280
Yeah, I'm kind of curious as to what's going on there but maybe it's just they just for

01:09:44.280 --> 01:09:45.960
whatever reason don't want to do it.

01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:49.080
Maybe they just want to try to get more people to tie their credit cards on PSN.

01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:50.080
Yeah.

01:09:50.080 --> 01:09:51.080
Or maybe.

01:09:51.080 --> 01:09:52.080
Yeah.

01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:54.400
It could have, we don't really know if it was Amazon's decision.

01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:56.280
Maybe because they just, maybe they just didn't sell well.

01:09:56.280 --> 01:10:01.020
Maybe people just buy those game codes at a retailer like a brick and mortar one.

01:10:01.020 --> 01:10:03.440
Or maybe Sony's got something competing coming up.

01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:04.440
Who knows?

01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:05.440
So.

01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:08.320
Alright, anyhow, let's travel the world and check out release dates.

01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:11.060
What is coming out to a gaming store near you this week?

01:10:11.060 --> 01:10:13.320
And it's starting to ramp up towards the holidays, right Loki?

01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:14.680
Ah yeah, it's already ramped up.

01:10:14.680 --> 01:10:15.680

Fast Dance Kids 2 on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.200
Ew, is that like Kidz Bop?

01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:55.160
You know, it used to be kind of like the wheels on the bus go round and round and that kind

01:10:55.160 --> 01:11:00.040
of bullshit, but actually it's not so much that now.

01:11:00.040 --> 01:11:06.280
They do have some songs on there, I'm not really sure if I recognize them.

01:11:06.280 --> 01:11:07.920
Is it just family safe stuff?

01:11:07.920 --> 01:11:14.380
Like old disco songs and not like, you know, ooh, pop your pussy girl, ooh, like that kind

01:11:14.380 --> 01:11:15.380
of music.

01:11:15.380 --> 01:11:16.380
Yeah, nothing like that.

01:11:16.380 --> 01:11:20.600
No, like they had some songs listed on here, like I don't even know what, yeah, shake your

01:11:20.600 --> 01:11:26.120
groove thing, obviously, uh, Whip My Hair, no idea what that is, Despicable Me.

01:11:26.120 --> 01:11:27.720
Wait, wait, you don't know Whip My Hair?

01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:29.760
No, what's Whip My Hair?

01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:31.400
Willow Smith?

01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:32.400
Will Smith's kid?

01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:35.280
Oh, no, I don't know his song, sorry, okay.

01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:37.800
No, no, it's not his song, it's his kid song.

01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:40.200
I whip my hair back and forth, you've never heard that song.

01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:42.920
No, I have not heard that song, and I don't wish to hear that song.

01:11:42.920 --> 01:11:44.640
Do you live in a cave or something?

01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:49.280
I don't listen to fucking radio, okay, oh, I'm sorry, it's not one of the ten songs that

01:11:49.280 --> 01:11:53.480
they play on top 40 stations, yes, I know, top 40, that means they play the same ten

01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:57.560
songs four times every hour.

01:11:57.560 --> 01:12:02.280
You have to hear how amazing this song is, and by amazing, I mean amazingly terrible,

01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:05.920
hold on, I'm trying to bring it up in studio right now, hold on, let's see here if I can

01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:06.920
get it going.

01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:21.000
Yeah, props to him, I mean, I hope that he does end up-

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:24.000
Just remember, she's nine.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:27.640
Come on, Loki, dance.

01:12:27.640 --> 01:12:32.040
Okay, I'll stop torturing the listeners.

01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:34.880
What the hell?

01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:39.720
She obviously did not inherit her dad's musical talent, but hey-

01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:41.920
She's nine, Loki, give her a break.

01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:44.840
Yeah, she's nine, I've seen better, okay, I mean-

01:12:44.840 --> 01:12:48.760
You've seen better nine year olds, really, where on Toddlers and Tiaras?

01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:53.320
Because I can't think of where else to see nine year olds performing.

01:12:53.320 --> 01:12:58.400
Well on America's Got Talent, on The X Factor, on, you know-

01:12:58.400 --> 01:13:00.440
Are you rooting for What's Her Name, that little girl?

01:13:00.440 --> 01:13:04.720
No, you see, here's the thing, I watched The X Factor one time.

01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:09.880
The first night it was on, and I haven't looked back.

01:13:09.880 --> 01:13:15.920
I think it's catchy, she has great producers, but whatever.

01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:20.040
Something That I Want and Love Me, I don't know any of those songs, anyways, so yeah,

DSi.

01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:47.680
It's basically a game for taking photos and editing photos or something like that.

01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:49.160
That sounds terrible.

01:13:49.160 --> 01:13:54.280

01:14:57.880 --> 01:14:58.880
a surprise.

01:14:58.880 --> 01:15:05.440
Grease Dance on Playstation 3 and Xbox 360, yes it's a Grease Dancing game, oh and singing

01:15:05.440 --> 01:15:06.840
of course.

01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:11.640
Monster High Ghoul Spirit, that's on the DS and on the Wii.

01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:15.760
Dead Rising 2 Off the Record on PC, that I actually may pick up so I can play that on

01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:18.760
my PC during the show.

01:15:18.760 --> 01:15:22.120
Puss in Boots on Xbox 360, Playstation 3.

01:15:22.120 --> 01:15:25.440
Oh yeah, they made a movie out of that didn't they?

01:15:25.440 --> 01:15:26.440
Yes they did.

01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:27.440
Okay.

01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:34.560
Cause they're done with Shrek and they need to, you know, Antonio Banderas needs to eat.

01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:39.720
That's on Xbox 360, Playstation 3, DS, Wii, and I think 3DS.

01:15:39.720 --> 01:15:46.040
Disney Universe, this is supposed to be like Kingdom Hearts, sort of, kinda, not really.

01:15:46.040 --> 01:15:50.040
I'm curious about Disney Universe, I gotta admit, cause like everybody was like, Rob

01:15:50.040 --> 01:15:54.240
you'd be so into this game, and I haven't heard a lot about it, which is usually a bad

01:15:54.240 --> 01:15:55.240
sign.

01:15:55.240 --> 01:15:59.320
It reminds me of a Ratchet and Clank type game, it's uh, you know, of course you get

01:15:59.320 --> 01:16:02.880
to wear different costumes, you can get abilities from those costumes.

01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:05.160
It's on 360, Wii, and PS3.

01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:09.480
House of the Dead Overkill, I'm looking, if you hear things in the background, I'm looking

01:16:09.480 --> 01:16:11.800
at like a little walkthrough, I guess, of the game.

01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:16.680
House of the Dead Overkill extended cut on Playstation 3 with even more swearing.

01:16:16.680 --> 01:16:20.680
Sorry, I don't wanna hear the, I was gonna play the audio, but it's just some douchebag

01:16:20.680 --> 01:16:22.260
talking over the gameplay.

01:16:22.260 --> 01:16:23.260
It looks neat.

01:16:23.260 --> 01:16:24.260
Yeah, it looks alright.

01:16:24.260 --> 01:16:26.080
It looks like a little big planet.

01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:30.760
I think I remember somebody saying something about like a little big planet-ish Disney

01:16:30.760 --> 01:16:31.760
game.

01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:36.080
Yeah, I mean, they look like the little big planet sack boys, but it's obviously not that,

01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:37.560
but I mean, it looks alright.

01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:39.120
That might be kinda fun, I might check that out.

01:16:39.120 --> 01:16:40.120
Definitely a good kid's game.

01:16:40.120 --> 01:16:41.120
Um.

01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:42.120
What do you mean kid's game?

01:16:42.120 --> 01:16:43.120
I love Disney.

01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:44.120
Alright.

01:16:44.120 --> 01:16:45.120
You hush.

01:16:45.120 --> 01:16:52.240
Uh, Dance Central 2 coming out this week on 360, also Kinect Sports Season 2 on 360, uh,

01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:59.120
The Invisibles Shadow Zone for PSP, including the camera, uh, Battlefield 3, the big game

01:16:59.120 --> 01:17:08.360

01:17:08.360 --> 01:17:15.160
Country Dance 2 on the Wii, and Jane's Advanced Strike Fighter for PC.

01:17:15.160 --> 01:17:16.160
That is it.

01:17:16.160 --> 01:17:17.160
That was a lot of games.

01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:20.200
It is a lot of games, and it's only gonna get bigger until it gets to December.

01:17:20.200 --> 01:17:24.520
Alright, Japan this week, going to Japan on the 27th of October, Dance Central 2 on the

01:17:24.520 --> 01:17:32.200
Xbox 360, Kinect Sports Season 2, Moovloov, Muv Luv, I don't know what this is, Muv Luv,

01:17:32.200 --> 01:17:35.760
and a Warhammer 40,000 space ring, I've gotta see what Muv Luv is.

01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:36.760
Muv Luv?

01:17:36.760 --> 01:17:37.760
I don't wanna see the peripheral for that.

01:17:37.760 --> 01:17:43.600
No, it's, it's not Muv Luv, I think it's an anime, I think it's based off an anime, cause

01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:46.680
clearly it's a bunch of anime chicks, I'm looking for, like, gameplay, and I don't see

01:17:46.680 --> 01:17:52.320
any, so, oh, there's one, that's, Muv Luv, looks like Sakura Wars, strategy, maybe?

01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:53.520
I don't know.

01:17:53.520 --> 01:17:58.620
Big Tittied Cyberbots, uh, let's see, moving on, the best kind, that is an awesome name

01:17:58.620 --> 01:18:01.360
for a game.

01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:05.480
Don't push your luck, just because we're getting, uh, bungee ferret tossing, don't push your

01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:12.240
luck on Big Tittied Cyberbots, although, if anything was gonna get added to the list,

01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:20.640
the week Jamie's not here, uh, on the Playstation 3 this week, Makai Senki Disgaea 4, that's

01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:25.420
right, Disgaea 4 out in Japan this week, as well as Midnight Club Los Angeles, uh, going

01:18:25.420 --> 01:18:31.040
into the Classics Collection, Tears to Tiara Gaiden, Avalon no Nazo, and, a lot of people

01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:37.640
very excited about this one, you ready, the Idolmaster 2 on the Playstation 3 this week.

01:18:37.640 --> 01:18:41.840
All I have to say about the Idolmaster is just, just, go look at some gameplay video

01:18:41.840 --> 01:18:45.880
on YouTube, that's really all I have to say, um, looking at some of the handhelds this

01:18:45.880 --> 01:18:52.480
week, the Sony PSP Arcana Familia, La Storia della Arcana Familia, I don't know what the

01:18:52.480 --> 01:18:58.000
heck this game is, uh, I don't know if that's, I'm trying to look again at gameplay, but

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:03.920
it just, again, looks like another anime slash comic manga type of integrated thing there,

01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:07.960
uh, Final Fantasy Type Zero, I think there'll be a few people excited about that, that is

01:19:07.960 --> 01:19:14.360
finally out on the PSP this week, Ragnarok Hikari Toyami no Kujo, yes, I believe this

01:19:14.360 --> 01:19:19.200
is another Ragnarok Online, yep, based game, that's what it looks like to me, so, Dark

01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:24.200
Sakura, sadly not here to squeak, Soshipop, are you gonna squeak on behalf of Dark Sakura?

01:19:24.200 --> 01:19:31.120

Woo.

01:21:07.320 --> 01:21:08.320
Alright.

01:21:08.320 --> 01:21:14.440
And there's a whole bunch of other stuff listed under generically October 2011 and I'm not

01:21:14.440 --> 01:21:15.880
gonna read off all that stuff.

01:21:15.880 --> 01:21:16.880
Yeah.

01:21:16.880 --> 01:21:17.880
There's a lot.

01:21:17.880 --> 01:21:18.880
That's fine.

01:21:18.880 --> 01:21:19.880
Alright, let's move on.

01:21:19.880 --> 01:21:23.320
Just a couple more stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week, yes, Dark

01:21:23.320 --> 01:21:27.320
Sakura has given her blessing that we could do a game this week without her, and we've

01:21:27.320 --> 01:21:28.480
got a good one tonight.

01:21:28.480 --> 01:21:30.560
Uh, meanwhile, couple quick news stories.

01:21:30.560 --> 01:21:31.560
Loki.

01:21:31.560 --> 01:21:36.680
Hey, I remember a few months back, several months back, there was a guy named Jigohot

01:21:36.680 --> 01:21:43.520
and there was a whole bunch of hub-a-bub about, uh, hub-a-lub, hub-a-loo, about, uh, you know,

01:21:43.520 --> 01:21:47.880
PlayStation 3 and jailbreaks and stuff like that and the keys being leaked out and all

01:21:47.880 --> 01:21:48.880
that fun stuff.

01:21:48.880 --> 01:21:50.680
Well, we're back to that again.

01:21:50.680 --> 01:21:53.640
Um, there is a new jailbreak that's out now.

01:21:53.640 --> 01:22:01.080
It apparently is for, uh, the firmware version 355 consoles and supports games up to current,

01:22:01.080 --> 01:22:06.080
up to the current firmware, uh, 3.73, so you're able to patch the games and play them on those

01:22:06.080 --> 01:22:07.080
consoles.

01:22:07.080 --> 01:22:13.760
Finally, the dongle will allow you to play titles burned to Blu-ray discs, uh, via, um,

01:22:13.760 --> 01:22:18.960
a hard drive, including FIFA 12, Driver San Francisco, God of War Origins Collection,

01:22:18.960 --> 01:22:25.320
Pro Evo 2012, X-Men Destiny, and Sniper Ghost Warrior, and, uh, it's circulating in Indonesia

01:22:25.320 --> 01:22:31.040
right now and will be sold for roughly 45 bucks, and, uh, they have, like, a little

01:22:31.040 --> 01:22:35.760
video showing it and it kinda boots up to, like, a developer screen and stuff like that.

01:22:35.760 --> 01:22:38.440
So obviously, what's that mean for everybody else?

01:22:38.440 --> 01:22:42.760
Well, it means a lot more patches and a lot more firmware updates, of course, as they

01:22:42.760 --> 01:22:48.240
try to block this thing, so look forward to that, and hopefully the network doesn't go

01:22:48.240 --> 01:22:52.280
down again.

01:22:52.280 --> 01:22:58.660
Like I've said before, I think, uh, crypto hackers that are really into DRM and stuff,

01:22:58.660 --> 01:23:00.480
they may not even care about games that much.

01:23:00.480 --> 01:23:04.600
They just love the challenge of breaking really good crypto, and then they put it out and

01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:08.680
they make money off of it, so, you know, who knows?

01:23:08.680 --> 01:23:12.520
But it's just gonna, you know, it's just like plugging your thumb into a dam with all these

01:23:12.520 --> 01:23:17.280
holes in it, trying to keep the water out, and only do it for so long.

01:23:17.280 --> 01:23:23.240
Alright, well, moving on to another story for you guys, this is actually a pretty big

01:23:23.240 --> 01:23:24.240
one.

01:23:24.240 --> 01:23:27.400
Nintendo had a press conference in the middle of the night, well, okay, it was day during

01:23:27.400 --> 01:23:30.760
Japan, but it was the middle of the night for us, about the 3DS, and just detailing

01:23:30.760 --> 01:23:34.280
a ton and ton of new updates coming for the 3DS.

01:23:34.280 --> 01:23:39.180
It's all around one big firmware update coming this November, I don't think we had a specific

01:23:39.180 --> 01:23:40.180
date on this, right?

01:23:40.180 --> 01:23:41.880
Of course not, so they can delay it.

01:23:41.880 --> 01:23:45.040
Right, so it can be the very last day of November and still be on time.

01:23:45.040 --> 01:23:48.700
Uh, some of the features that are gonna be in this, 3D video recording, which they've

01:23:48.700 --> 01:23:54.320
said before, um, you're gonna be able to make clips up to 10 minutes long, what also is

01:23:54.320 --> 01:23:59.320
part of this, which I admit is kinda cool, stop motion animation, part of the 3D videos.

01:23:59.320 --> 01:24:00.320
That's neat.

01:24:00.320 --> 01:24:04.720
I mean, it's easy, but it's, it's gonna, you know people are gonna get creative with this,

01:24:04.720 --> 01:24:05.720
it'll be fun.

01:24:05.720 --> 01:24:11.440
I, it's, it's a neat idea, but, ugh, cameras are just really terrible.

01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:14.320
But that's alright, they'll fix that in the next version of the 3DS, so.

01:24:14.320 --> 01:24:19.960
Uh, there will be a map overlay to show where Miis you got in StreetPass are from, but,

01:24:19.960 --> 01:24:23.320
I don't, does that mean, like, you'll literally be able to see, like, I got a hundred people

01:24:23.320 --> 01:24:24.320
at Disneyland?

01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:25.760
Well, Rob, it'll be nice to know where you live.

01:24:25.760 --> 01:24:29.840
Well, yeah, but when you specify where you live on the 3DS, they don't have GPS in them,

01:24:29.840 --> 01:24:31.800
you just say California.

01:24:31.800 --> 01:24:34.680
You know, it'll be interesting, because I get a lot of StreetPasses at Disneyland when

01:24:34.680 --> 01:24:39.080
I go, and I get a lot of people from Mexico, and I get a lot of people, of course, in California,

01:24:39.080 --> 01:24:42.120
but I get all around the U.S., because, of course, Disneyland is a place for everybody

01:24:42.120 --> 01:24:43.120
around the world.

01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:47.680
I have a shit-ton of Miis from Japan, thanks to that day we were at E3, and I StreetPass

01:24:47.680 --> 01:24:52.000
with, like, 50 people in, like, five minutes, so, eh.

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:57.280
You will be able to transfer software to other 3DS systems, which is good, because if, uh,

01:24:57.280 --> 01:25:00.360
the inevitable, you know, Game Boy Advance games come out, and then you've got the inevitable

01:25:00.360 --> 01:25:03.600
3DS upgrade that will happen next year, so, of course, you're gonna get suckered into

01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:06.920
buying the new 3DS, you won't lose any of the shit you got on the current DS.

01:25:06.920 --> 01:25:09.760
So where's my refund for the, uh, 3DS when that happens?

01:25:09.760 --> 01:25:10.840
Keep on dreaming.

01:25:10.840 --> 01:25:16.440
And, uh, the Find Me RPG that's built into the 3DS will get a sequel if you've cleared

01:25:16.440 --> 01:25:18.060
the first iteration.

01:25:18.060 --> 01:25:23.640
More hats, Joy, because right now the sequel is Play the Game Again.

01:25:23.640 --> 01:25:27.240
You've got a shit-load of people on that from your trips to Disneyland, and you still

01:25:27.240 --> 01:25:28.240
only have...

01:25:28.240 --> 01:25:32.120
No, I've beat Find Me once, and I'm on the second go-through right now, about halfway

01:25:32.120 --> 01:25:33.120
through go-through number two.

01:25:33.120 --> 01:25:34.120
But do you get more hats?

01:25:34.120 --> 01:25:35.120
You do, actually.

01:25:35.120 --> 01:25:37.840
Well, you've encountered people with these awesome-looking, like, Metroid hats and all

01:25:37.840 --> 01:25:40.600
this stuff, that they must have beat the game several times to get that.

01:25:40.600 --> 01:25:42.800
No, I have the Metroid hat and I have the crown.

01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:46.280
I don't have that demon hat that, like, is changed color.

01:25:46.280 --> 01:25:50.360
I think that's what you get time to, because that's the last boss in Find Me, so I'm thinking

01:25:50.360 --> 01:25:52.680
it's what you get on the second play-through when you beat it.

01:25:52.680 --> 01:25:53.680
Okay.

01:25:53.680 --> 01:25:57.680
So, one puzzle piece away from having every single puzzle piece in the puzzle exchange

01:25:57.680 --> 01:25:58.680
game.

01:25:58.680 --> 01:26:02.400
So, I'll have that soon, too.

01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:07.560
Does finding every puzzle piece make your 3DS spawn another analog stick?

01:26:07.560 --> 01:26:08.560
Don't think so.

01:26:08.560 --> 01:26:12.360
You just get pretty 3D pictures to rotate around, and the one last one I need is those

01:26:12.360 --> 01:26:14.360
stupid pigmen.

01:26:14.360 --> 01:26:19.900
Also, I guess there's supposed to be another new StreetPass game that's not just Find Me,

01:26:19.900 --> 01:26:22.680
so I guess they're adding more for the StreetPass stuff, which is cool.

01:26:22.680 --> 01:26:26.320
A few more details on Mario Kart 7 came out.

01:26:26.320 --> 01:26:30.480
You will be able to do 8 player online at 60 frames a second.

01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:32.880
That's pretty impressive, if true, so that'll be cool.

01:26:32.880 --> 01:26:35.420
You can do online or offline racing.

01:26:35.420 --> 01:26:39.280
You will be able to set up communities, so you can have groups of people to race against

01:26:39.280 --> 01:26:41.360
and have criteria for these communities.

01:26:41.360 --> 01:26:42.360
That's kind of cool.

01:26:42.360 --> 01:26:45.640
If there's an OLR community way to do that, we will build one, absolutely.

01:26:45.640 --> 01:26:50.760
You're going to be able to get data from other people by using StreetPass, which will be

01:26:50.760 --> 01:26:54.200
win-loss records, coin data, and ghost data.

01:26:54.200 --> 01:26:57.040
That's kind of cool, because that's in Ridge Racer right now, so that'll be cool to have

01:26:57.040 --> 01:26:58.360
that in Mario Kart.

01:26:58.360 --> 01:27:01.620
Also announced, Lakitu and Metal Mario as characters.

01:27:01.620 --> 01:27:04.320
They're really stretching now, aren't they?

01:27:04.320 --> 01:27:08.040
Hulu Plus will be coming to the 3DS, and the Wii.

01:27:08.040 --> 01:27:13.160
Mario Kart, you can put characters from your other franchises in there.

01:27:13.160 --> 01:27:18.800
You don't just have to do Mario and Donkey Kong, because Donkey Kong's not part of the

01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:23.840
Yeah, I know he was in the first Donkey Kong game, but the new Donkey Kong Country Crap

01:27:23.840 --> 01:27:27.200
is not part of the Mario series.

01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:35.320
It's its own thing, so you can put Zelda and Samus and stuff like that.

01:27:35.320 --> 01:27:39.000
There's a lot more characters to use other than Metal Mario.

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:40.000
That's true.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:43.240
They could be put, yeah, they could cross over, or just Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man are

01:27:43.240 --> 01:27:44.240
in the arcade one.

01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:47.880
I mean, I know the arcade one's made by Namco, but still, you've got that agreement.

01:27:47.880 --> 01:27:52.960
Or, you know, some of the Smash Brothers characters, like, you know, some of the F-Zero characters.

01:27:52.960 --> 01:27:55.720
Kid Icarus and his car can fly.

01:27:55.720 --> 01:27:57.040
He gets extra hang glider power.

01:27:57.040 --> 01:27:58.040
Alright, anyway.

01:27:58.040 --> 01:28:02.660
Hulu Plus, as I was saying, is also coming to the 3DS and the Wii soon.

01:28:02.660 --> 01:28:06.400
I'm assuming it's with that upgrade, but I guess it could be even sooner.

01:28:06.400 --> 01:28:10.440
Hulu Plus, of course, will still cost you money to get all those TV episodes, but some

01:28:10.440 --> 01:28:14.300
people are using it, especially as people are leaving Netflix, they're turning to Hulu

01:28:14.300 --> 01:28:15.300
Plus.

01:28:15.300 --> 01:28:19.960
So let's just pop, you use my 3DS more than I do, and you use it for Netflix a lot.

01:28:19.960 --> 01:28:24.920
So if, hypothetically, if we were paying for Hulu Plus, would you be down with that?

01:28:24.920 --> 01:28:30.080
The Netflix client on the 3DS, in my opinion, is really bad and laggy and awful, and it

01:28:30.080 --> 01:28:34.720
times out all the time, and it's not wireless, so I would need the Hulu Plus client to be

01:28:34.720 --> 01:28:35.720
better than that.

01:28:35.720 --> 01:28:36.720
Interesting.

01:28:36.720 --> 01:28:38.840
I didn't even realize it was that crappy.

01:28:38.840 --> 01:28:42.200
What's important to note, though, is that while you might go, meh, or lol, they're still

01:28:42.200 --> 01:28:46.640
supporting the Wii, Netflix, the Wii is the number one for Netflix, which surprised the

01:28:46.640 --> 01:28:49.000
hell out of me, but they're in enough homes where, yeah.

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:52.480
We'll look at the sales date of how many Wiis were sold, it's not that much of a stretch.

01:28:52.480 --> 01:28:55.040
So that's going to be big for them to get Hulu Plus.

01:28:55.040 --> 01:29:00.200
I think this is kind of neat, more so than almost anything else, is that the 3DS is going

01:29:00.200 --> 01:29:03.900
to be getting a messaging system called Nintendo Letterbox.

01:29:03.900 --> 01:29:07.640
You will be able to send notes and photos and sounds to friends.

01:29:07.640 --> 01:29:12.360
I mean, granted, you can kind of do this with what's called a cell phone, with SMS and so

01:29:12.360 --> 01:29:16.080
forth, but it opens it up to younger folks if, you know, the parents are supervising

01:29:16.080 --> 01:29:17.080
it.

01:29:17.080 --> 01:29:20.480
Well, and they had it on the Wii, where you can send messages and photos.

01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:24.480
But your Wii didn't really have a camera built in, so like, I could take 3D pictures of Disneyland

01:29:24.480 --> 01:29:27.100
and send it to my friends and make them jealous, that'll be kind of cool.

01:29:27.100 --> 01:29:29.300
So I don't know, I think it's neat.

01:29:29.300 --> 01:29:33.400
I'm not like, oh my god, it's the most amazing technology ever to happen, but it seems like

01:29:33.400 --> 01:29:38.240
one of those things where it's like, wow, Nintendo's finally starting to like, catch up with online

01:29:38.240 --> 01:29:41.520
and starting to implement features that we were seeing in other systems like five years

01:29:41.520 --> 01:29:42.520
ago.

01:29:42.520 --> 01:29:47.480
But at least it's forward movement, good job.

01:29:47.480 --> 01:29:52.760
So lots of stuff coming out for the 3DS in November, maybe even sooner for some of this

01:29:52.760 --> 01:29:53.760
other stuff.

01:29:53.760 --> 01:29:54.760
So we'll see.

01:29:54.760 --> 01:30:01.080
All right, meanwhile, it is time to open up the gaming vault and take a trip in and find

01:30:01.080 --> 01:30:03.480
a classic video game of the week.

01:30:03.480 --> 01:30:08.560
Now, DarkSakura is not here tonight, but she left a key to her house, and she left the

01:30:08.560 --> 01:30:09.900
vault unlocked.

01:30:09.900 --> 01:30:14.040
So we made SalaciousPop go into the vault and find a game that he thinks you should

01:30:14.040 --> 01:30:17.120
be playing this week, so that we wouldn't get in trouble.

01:30:17.120 --> 01:30:21.360
SalaciousPop, what did you find in DarkSakura's vault that is worthy of being the classic

01:30:21.360 --> 01:30:22.480
game of the week?

01:30:22.480 --> 01:30:28.000
One of the first and one of the best original Legend of Zelda clones for the NES, a little

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:31.400
SNK RPG known as Crystallis.

01:30:31.400 --> 01:30:32.400
Good pick.

01:30:32.400 --> 01:30:33.400
Very good pick.

01:30:33.400 --> 01:30:36.400
I was really surprised DarkSakura had never done this one, because it seems like one of

01:30:36.400 --> 01:30:40.160
those things is obvious to me.

01:30:40.160 --> 01:30:47.320
Crystallis was released in Japan April 13th of 1990 and came out in the US, translated

01:30:47.320 --> 01:30:53.120
for the NES, three months later in July of 90.

01:30:53.120 --> 01:31:00.440
It was praised for the original 8-bit NES, relatively advanced graphics, very beautiful

01:31:00.440 --> 01:31:04.080
game, and also its fantastic soundtrack.

01:31:04.080 --> 01:31:09.920
And I usually would just forget who actually made Crystallis.

01:31:09.920 --> 01:31:15.920
I was thinking it was maybe one of Enix's first RPGs, but no, it was SNK, as of King

01:31:15.920 --> 01:31:16.920
of Fighters fame.

01:31:16.920 --> 01:31:22.840
This is an RPG they put out, and I'm sure they've had titles in Japan that may not have

01:31:22.840 --> 01:31:26.480
made it over here, but I can't think of any other SNK RPGs.

01:31:26.480 --> 01:31:30.320
Can you?

01:31:30.320 --> 01:31:32.600
Not really, no I can't actually.

01:31:32.600 --> 01:31:38.800
So yeah, this is kind of just a weird sort of anomaly, but it was a fantastic game.

01:31:38.800 --> 01:31:46.280
The title in Japan was God Slayer Haruka Tenku no Sonata, which is a God Slayer Sonata of

01:31:46.280 --> 01:31:48.520
the Faraway Sky.

01:31:48.520 --> 01:31:57.480
Part of the plot is that basically humanity built this huge powerful tower for whatever

01:31:57.480 --> 01:32:03.640
nefarious reason, technology got out of control, and once this tower was built up in the sky,

01:32:03.640 --> 01:32:09.840
there was some big apocalypse, and now the world is overrun with monsters.

01:32:09.840 --> 01:32:17.920
You wake up in a very sort of futuristic sci-fi hibernation chamber where there's a big glass

01:32:17.920 --> 01:32:21.560
door that slides open, and you come out, and you have amnesia, and you don't know what's

01:32:21.560 --> 01:32:28.160
going on or who you are, and you find sort of a little old RPG town, and they're like

01:32:28.160 --> 01:32:31.560
you came out of that cave, and oh my god.

01:32:31.560 --> 01:32:38.040
So you have to figure out who you are, and these four sages basically say that this evil

01:32:38.040 --> 01:32:44.520
dude is trying to get into the tower, the Dragonia Empire is trying to get into the

01:32:44.520 --> 01:32:49.600
tower so they can go blow up the world again, and you have to find these four swords, Earth,

01:32:49.600 --> 01:32:55.440
Fire, Wind, Water, and you have to combine them to form Crystallus, and then only then

01:32:55.440 --> 01:32:59.600
once you have that legendary sword, you can then take out the evil dude, and of course

01:32:59.600 --> 01:33:05.720
if you're thinking that sounds kind of Zelda-ish, at least Link to the Past and so on, then

01:33:05.720 --> 01:33:11.400
you'd probably be right that the plot lines are sort of similar.

01:33:11.400 --> 01:33:16.800
The water sword you could use if you swung it, you could make little ice bridges over

01:33:16.800 --> 01:33:20.760
narrow little streams of water, so there were some puzzle solving elements too on which

01:33:20.760 --> 01:33:22.260
sword you used.

01:33:22.260 --> 01:33:28.000
You also had XP, so you would gain levels and your stats would go up, and it was possible

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:37.480
if you wanted to grind and min-max your way all the way up to level 99 stats with everything.

01:33:37.480 --> 01:33:42.560
It had some kind of janky collision detection, where you would try to avoid a monster and

01:33:42.560 --> 01:33:48.040
you would still hit it anyway, or trying to navigate some of the lava and the paths were

01:33:48.040 --> 01:33:49.040
kind of weird.

01:33:49.040 --> 01:33:53.920
I know that it suffered from, you know like in Mega Man games when there were too many

01:33:53.920 --> 01:34:00.120
sprites, it would get kind of stuttery, Crystallus had a lot of that, but otherwise it was a

01:34:00.120 --> 01:34:06.720
very solid action RPG that had a lot of Final Fantasy elements with Legend of Zelda elements

01:34:06.720 --> 01:34:09.420
in it too.

01:34:09.420 --> 01:34:16.680
One thing to note is that two of the four sages that helped guide you in fulfilling

01:34:16.680 --> 01:34:25.280
your destiny is that they were based off of Kensou and Athena, the magical girl pop star

01:34:25.280 --> 01:34:28.200
from King of Fighters and Sai Kensou.

01:34:28.200 --> 01:34:34.080
Two of the elders are analogs of them, so that was kind of some meta fan service even

01:34:34.080 --> 01:34:38.280
back then in 1990 that they had done for their previous franchise, and I believe this was

01:34:38.280 --> 01:34:41.720
before King of Fighters was a thing in 1990.

01:34:41.720 --> 01:34:47.760
Fatal Fury I believe was out by then, and the Athena, the platformer with Sai and Athena

01:34:47.760 --> 01:34:48.760
in it.

01:34:48.760 --> 01:34:52.440
I was going to say, wasn't that also an NES game, like way, way, way early on?

01:34:52.440 --> 01:34:56.680
Yeah, so those characters were already established and they did some fan service-y things with

01:34:56.680 --> 01:34:57.680
Kensou and Athena and Crystallus.

01:34:57.680 --> 01:35:02.280
Yeah, I remember seeing that in Crystallus and I was like, is that tied to the other

01:35:02.280 --> 01:35:03.280
game?

01:35:03.280 --> 01:35:09.400
Yeah, and there's a female character who you find who seems to have all of her memories

01:35:09.400 --> 01:35:13.840
and you can tell by looking at her character model or her sprite that she's obviously from

01:35:13.840 --> 01:35:18.480
the same time as you and she was hibernated in the past and awoke in the future just like

01:35:18.480 --> 01:35:24.800
you were, and she kind of plays a role like Sheik in Ocarina of Time where she sort of

01:35:24.800 --> 01:35:29.880
shows up and gives some expositive, you know, narrative and helps you and then disappears

01:35:29.880 --> 01:35:30.880
again.

01:35:30.880 --> 01:35:36.240
And it turns out that both you and her are scientists that willfully froze yourself so

01:35:36.240 --> 01:35:37.640
that you could reawaken.

01:35:37.640 --> 01:35:41.720
Spoiler, yeah, and help save the world.

01:35:41.720 --> 01:35:43.960
This is a kick-ass game.

01:35:43.960 --> 01:35:44.960
This is a great game.

01:35:44.960 --> 01:35:48.800
I mean, graphical problems aside, it was just so good.

01:35:48.800 --> 01:35:52.840
I remember it used to make my friend really sad because his birthday was October 1st and

01:35:52.840 --> 01:35:56.720
when he blew up this game, he goes, October 1st, 1997, the end day.

01:35:56.720 --> 01:35:59.000
That's my birthday.

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:00.000
That's awesome.

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:01.000
Oh, yeah.

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:02.000
I remember that.

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:05.840
It had that little in-game or cinematic.

01:36:05.840 --> 01:36:06.840
Which we survived.

01:36:06.840 --> 01:36:10.160
We got past the end day and then some.

01:36:10.160 --> 01:36:15.960
And there are a lot of similarities with the plot and the overall styling and art direction

01:36:15.960 --> 01:36:22.640
of the game that makes people think that it was influenced in part by Miyazaki's Nausicaa

01:36:22.640 --> 01:36:24.760
of the Valley of the Wind.

01:36:24.760 --> 01:36:30.520
The floating tower and a lot of the themes are similar.

01:36:30.520 --> 01:36:39.080
And the first village that you find when you wake up from the cave is called Leaf, which

01:36:39.080 --> 01:36:44.160
I believe there is a village in Nausicaa that was named the same thing.

01:36:44.160 --> 01:36:46.680
Or it could just be that Leaf is kind of a common term.

01:36:46.680 --> 01:36:47.680
Yeah.

01:36:47.680 --> 01:36:56.080
Some of the bosses, I don't know if this is a glitch, but basically if you just spam the

01:36:56.080 --> 01:37:00.680
shit out of your sword attack button, you could kind of kill bosses by just button mashing.

01:37:00.680 --> 01:37:05.720
I see here that a lot of people had problems with that when there was supposed to be some

01:37:05.720 --> 01:37:09.880
sort of more styled way on what weapons to use on a boss, but you kind of could ignore

01:37:09.880 --> 01:37:13.960
that and just find its weak spot and beat the hell out of it.

01:37:13.960 --> 01:37:14.960
But yeah, it's a great game.

01:37:14.960 --> 01:37:18.200
If you have a way to play it, you should check it out.

01:37:18.200 --> 01:37:21.840
Alright, your classic game of the week for the Nintendo Entertainment System and then

01:37:21.840 --> 01:37:23.880
later on the Game Boy Color.

01:37:23.880 --> 01:37:24.880
Crystallis.

01:37:24.880 --> 01:37:26.280
Good pick.

01:37:26.280 --> 01:37:28.280
Hopefully Jamie wasn't saving that one.

01:37:28.280 --> 01:37:31.320
I don't know, but it's about time that one came up.

01:37:31.320 --> 01:37:32.320
That's a great pick.

01:37:32.320 --> 01:37:34.200
Alright, we are going to take a break, guys, but don't go anywhere.

01:37:34.200 --> 01:37:38.240
We're going to come back with plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio, including some rapid

01:37:38.240 --> 01:37:45.680
fire news, some early talk about Xbox and PlayStation 4, and can you believe we haven't

01:37:45.680 --> 01:37:47.080
brought this game up yet tonight?

01:37:47.080 --> 01:37:48.440
It's all people have been talking about all week.

01:37:48.440 --> 01:37:51.240
Arkham City, we've got to talk about some things with that.

01:37:51.240 --> 01:37:55.320
The mailbag, the FUs of the week, the Twitter topics, and your calls when we come back with

01:37:55.320 --> 01:38:03.480
more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:38:03.480 --> 01:38:06.040
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:38:06.040 --> 01:38:07.560
We are live tonight.

01:38:07.560 --> 01:38:13.720
The 433rd episode of our show for this October the 23rd of 2011.

01:38:13.720 --> 01:38:17.760
Dark Sakura, not here tonight, sadly, but taking her place and doing a mighty fine job

01:38:17.760 --> 01:38:18.760
so far.

01:38:18.760 --> 01:38:22.880
Salacious Pop, with a good classic game of the week, by the way.

01:38:22.880 --> 01:38:23.880
Very good job.

01:38:23.880 --> 01:38:24.880
Thank you.

01:38:24.880 --> 01:38:26.720
One of the games that came up in the last segment that I was reading a little more about

01:38:26.720 --> 01:38:30.080
during the break, because I was just curious about this, Disney Universe.

01:38:30.080 --> 01:38:33.440
It really does look like it's going to be just like Little Big Planet.

01:38:33.440 --> 01:38:35.400
It doesn't even try to hide it.

01:38:35.400 --> 01:38:39.720
But they say, I'm looking up the Wiki on it, and they're saying, well, it also kind of

01:38:39.720 --> 01:38:41.280
looks like the Lego games, I guess.

01:38:41.280 --> 01:38:46.160
But you play through six different worlds to beat enemies, get power ups and coins.

01:38:46.160 --> 01:38:50.460
And I guess you can put on costumes resembling characters from 40 classic and contemporary

01:38:50.460 --> 01:38:52.640
Disney and Pixar properties.

01:38:52.640 --> 01:38:55.000
Of course, the first thing I said is, is there Tron?

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:56.000
Is there Tron?

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:57.000
Is there Tron?

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:58.000
Is there Tron?

01:38:58.000 --> 01:38:59.000
There's Tron.

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:00.000
Tron Legacy is one of them.

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:01.560
Sadly, I don't think that's one of the worlds you'll get to fight in.

01:39:01.560 --> 01:39:03.500
That would make me very sad.

01:39:03.500 --> 01:39:04.720
Maybe downloadable later.

01:39:04.720 --> 01:39:06.440
But I love that there's like a WALL-E and stuff too.

01:39:06.440 --> 01:39:07.440
I don't know.

01:39:07.440 --> 01:39:09.040
I might, I might, I might have to check this out.

01:39:09.040 --> 01:39:10.720
I'm kind of a sucker for Disney stuff.

01:39:10.720 --> 01:39:12.920
And Little Big Planet obviously is a great game.

01:39:12.920 --> 01:39:13.920
So we'll see.

01:39:13.920 --> 01:39:15.720
Of course, it's probably a $60 game.

01:39:15.720 --> 01:39:16.720
Huh?

01:39:16.720 --> 01:39:17.720
I don't know.

01:39:17.720 --> 01:39:18.720
Uh, no.

01:39:18.720 --> 01:39:19.720
Oh, it's not?

01:39:19.720 --> 01:39:20.720
I think like 50.

01:39:20.720 --> 01:39:21.720
Oh, well, gee, such a value.

01:39:21.720 --> 01:39:23.560
Such a, it's a bargain basement.

01:39:23.560 --> 01:39:24.560
Oh boy.

01:39:24.560 --> 01:39:25.560
All right.

01:39:25.560 --> 01:39:29.240
Let's go around and do some rapid fire news because, you know, sometimes there's a lot

01:39:29.240 --> 01:39:32.040
of news and we don't have a lot of time to go too in depth, but we want to just make

01:39:32.040 --> 01:39:34.580
sure we cover a few things here.

01:39:34.580 --> 01:39:37.720
Sony's 3D display will be coming out November 13th.

01:39:37.720 --> 01:39:45.240
Of course, it's $499 and it comes with, you know, Motorstorm Apocalypse, uh, unfortunately

01:39:45.240 --> 01:39:49.600
the Resistance 3, unlike promised before, but you know, whatever.

01:39:49.600 --> 01:39:54.840
Um, also of course, you know, a pair of glasses and an HDMI cable that you'll need to use

01:39:54.840 --> 01:39:57.640
that with your PlayStation 3.

01:39:57.640 --> 01:40:03.560
And uh, you can also buy separate sets of glasses for $70 as well.

01:40:03.560 --> 01:40:07.960
And there are games supporting it so far, uh, you know, Motorstorm Apocalypse, Gran

01:40:07.960 --> 01:40:14.800
Turismo 5, and Killzone 3, and Super Stardust HD all support the Simulview, um, right now

01:40:14.800 --> 01:40:15.800
at launch.

01:40:15.800 --> 01:40:21.960
And I believe I saw that, um, Ridge Racer is supposed to be getting 3D support as well,

01:40:21.960 --> 01:40:22.960
so that's kind of neat.

01:40:22.960 --> 01:40:26.840
Because that's a game that would probably benefit from it quite a bit.

01:40:26.840 --> 01:40:31.200
Um, of course, people have been begging and pleading, you know, Valve, when are you going

01:40:31.200 --> 01:40:37.640
to release some, you know, stuff I can buy for Portal, like, you know, actual Portal

01:40:37.640 --> 01:40:40.840
turrets and cubes and whatnot.

01:40:40.840 --> 01:40:44.440
Well, uh, you will be able to buy a Portal turret very soon.

01:40:44.440 --> 01:40:50.720
Uh, it's going to be plush, which, you know, fine, that's close enough, I guess.

01:40:50.720 --> 01:40:56.260
It does have a glowing red eye with a motion detector and will, of course, spout different

01:40:56.260 --> 01:41:04.240
phrases from the game, and, uh, they will be going on sale mid-December on ThinkGeek,

01:41:04.240 --> 01:41:06.480
is where you can purchase those.

01:41:06.480 --> 01:41:11.600
Of course, also, to go along with that will be the official, um, Portal companion cube.

01:41:11.600 --> 01:41:14.480
I thought they already had a cuddly companion cube, or was that-

01:41:14.480 --> 01:41:17.640
I think a lot of those have been, like, you know, people made them on, uh-

01:41:17.640 --> 01:41:18.640
Was that, like, an Etsy ripoff?

01:41:18.640 --> 01:41:23.600
Well, no, weren't there the official- they were, like, dice for your win- for your rear-view

01:41:23.600 --> 01:41:24.600
mirror in your car.

01:41:24.600 --> 01:41:25.600
I remember, okay, maybe it was that.

01:41:25.600 --> 01:41:26.600
They keep dice.

01:41:26.600 --> 01:41:32.960
This one is, uh, it's not huge, it's, like, six inches cubed, obviously, and, um, it'll

01:41:32.960 --> 01:41:38.320
be available, uh, via the NECA shop, um, in November.

01:41:38.320 --> 01:41:40.320
Please don't throw them in the fireplace.

01:41:40.320 --> 01:41:48.240
I guess, um, that'll be, yeah, coming out, so, um, neat, I guess.

01:41:48.240 --> 01:41:53.320
Like I said, I preferred that the Portal turret wasn't exactly a, uh, plush item, it kinda

01:41:53.320 --> 01:41:55.880
looks stupid when it's plush.

01:41:55.880 --> 01:42:02.600
You know, I'd rather a plastic thing that I can shoot bullets out of, you know.

01:42:02.600 --> 01:42:03.600
I don't know.

01:42:03.600 --> 01:42:08.120
Um, and then, of course, you know, to go along with Portal, there's some discussion regarding

01:42:08.120 --> 01:42:15.120
the second DLC, um, expansion, which will be coming, uh, early next year, or late next

01:42:15.120 --> 01:42:20.400
year, depending if it gets delayed, and, uh, it will include an in-game editor.

01:42:20.400 --> 01:42:24.440
You may remember they were talking about, um, something before, saying, wouldn't it

01:42:24.440 --> 01:42:29.040
be kinda cool if we could create some sort of, like, almost like a Photoshop for Portal

01:42:29.040 --> 01:42:34.160
level editing that you can, you know, just very easily create your own levels?

01:42:34.160 --> 01:42:35.360
Well, they're gonna do that.

01:42:35.360 --> 01:42:42.360
Also, they're gonna allow, um, I guess, some additional, uh, view, play, vote on various

01:42:42.360 --> 01:42:46.360
levels, that are gonna be, I think, included in this, and, um, one of the things that they're

01:42:46.360 --> 01:42:52.320
gonna be adding is the ability to actually play, um, levels within the game without having

01:42:52.320 --> 01:42:55.120
to actually go into the console and load up a level.

01:42:55.120 --> 01:42:58.000
You'll be able to actually select user-made levels, because there's a lot of them out

01:42:58.000 --> 01:42:59.000
there.

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:00.000
Wow.

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:01.000
Which would be awesome.

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:02.000
Yeah.

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:06.560
And, of course, no word if that's coming to 360, since 360 doesn't have Steam, so.

01:43:06.560 --> 01:43:11.360
Wasn't Valve supposed to have some big announcement after Portal 2 came out on what their next

01:43:11.360 --> 01:43:12.360
project is?

01:43:12.360 --> 01:43:14.360
Because, as I understand it, we don't really know-

01:43:14.360 --> 01:43:15.360
Defense of the Agents.

01:43:15.360 --> 01:43:16.360
Of Dota 2.

01:43:16.360 --> 01:43:17.360
Oh, that's right.

01:43:17.360 --> 01:43:18.360
Okay.

01:43:18.360 --> 01:43:19.360
Yeah.

01:43:19.360 --> 01:43:20.360
Because I was thinking, what is their next big thing that they're working on?

01:43:20.360 --> 01:43:21.360
It's certainly not Half-Life.

01:43:21.360 --> 01:43:22.360
Don't get me started.

01:43:22.360 --> 01:43:23.360
It's still 2.

01:43:23.360 --> 01:43:25.360
I mean, because they've already, you've seen, there's clips of that on YouTube, like, people

01:43:25.360 --> 01:43:29.060
are already playing it at, I guess, conventions or some type of thing.

01:43:29.060 --> 01:43:31.360
But then, after that, who knows?

01:43:31.360 --> 01:43:32.360
So.

01:43:32.360 --> 01:43:35.920
Sorry, Slice2Pop, I don't think it'll be Half-Life 3, but we'll see.

01:43:35.920 --> 01:43:36.920
You never know.

01:43:36.920 --> 01:43:37.920
You never know.

01:43:37.920 --> 01:43:42.840
Christmas may come early this year, Slice2Pop, have you been good?

01:43:42.840 --> 01:43:45.920
I think if it's gonna be anything, they're just gonna update the whole source engine

01:43:45.920 --> 01:43:50.880
just to do something brand new, like Half-Life 3 engine or something.

01:43:50.880 --> 01:43:53.280
That's what's probably taking it so long, is they're gonna have to create a new engine

01:43:53.280 --> 01:43:54.280
for it.

01:43:54.280 --> 01:43:59.720
Kaijuto in our chatroom at chat.orangestop.com says, I want Portal PJs.

01:43:59.720 --> 01:44:03.720
Would they be little companion cubes, or little, like, blue and orange portals, or what?

01:44:03.720 --> 01:44:06.880
I saw this girl that had these portal earrings I thought were really cute, where she had

01:44:06.880 --> 01:44:10.400
a blue portal on one ear and an orange one on the other, and, like, a guy running through.

01:44:10.400 --> 01:44:11.920
I thought it was cute.

01:44:11.920 --> 01:44:15.080
So there's a lot of cute little nerdy things out there.

01:44:15.080 --> 01:44:21.040
Anyhow, moving on to some rumored, I guess, holiday-related bundles coming to the PlayStation

01:44:21.040 --> 01:44:22.040
3.

01:44:22.040 --> 01:44:29.240
A Mayhem Edition move bundle that will contain Killzone 3 and Resistance 3 apparently is

01:44:29.240 --> 01:44:30.240
being rumored.

01:44:30.240 --> 01:44:35.280
I guess this is some box factory snapshots that have leaked onto the internet.

01:44:35.280 --> 01:44:39.240
Also a special edition of LittleBigPlanet 2 is supposedly on the way.

01:44:39.240 --> 01:44:40.240
It's about time.

01:44:40.240 --> 01:44:41.240
I've been waiting for one of those.

01:44:41.240 --> 01:44:42.640
It's their Game of the Year edition, obviously.

01:44:42.640 --> 01:44:46.240
Remember I said I wouldn't buy it until the Game of the Year edition came out.

01:44:46.240 --> 01:44:49.160
It's November 22nd.

01:44:49.160 --> 01:44:50.160
Is it cheaper?

01:44:50.160 --> 01:44:51.160
Is it cheaper?

01:44:51.160 --> 01:44:52.160
Is it cheaper?

01:44:52.160 --> 01:44:53.160
It's the same price.

01:44:53.160 --> 01:44:54.160
It's $59.99.

01:44:54.160 --> 01:44:55.160
But it has all the expansions in it.

01:44:55.160 --> 01:44:56.160
I guess it's cool.

01:44:56.160 --> 01:44:59.880
And they're also doing a bundle that's going to have the move controller with it as well.

01:44:59.880 --> 01:45:01.440
Oh, that's cool.

01:45:01.440 --> 01:45:06.040
Our last few trips to Target and Best Buy have been you going LittleBigPlanet 2.

01:45:06.040 --> 01:45:07.040
There it is.

01:45:07.040 --> 01:45:08.040
And I don't know.

01:45:08.040 --> 01:45:09.920
I don't think they're doing a Game of the Year, so maybe I should pick it up this time.

01:45:09.920 --> 01:45:11.920
Yeah, you can just borrow mine.

01:45:11.920 --> 01:45:12.920
Really?

01:45:12.920 --> 01:45:13.920
Because I think I will.

01:45:13.920 --> 01:45:15.920
I haven't been playing it.

01:45:15.920 --> 01:45:18.280
Yeah, heck yeah.

01:45:18.280 --> 01:45:19.960
That's even cheaper than $60.

01:45:19.960 --> 01:45:20.960
Alright.

01:45:20.960 --> 01:45:25.880
Also, coming out very soon, like this week, Dance Central 2 is coming out.

01:45:25.880 --> 01:45:27.480
A demo is already out on Xbox Live.

01:45:27.480 --> 01:45:31.280
I forgot to download that and check it out, but you know, if you have a Kinect, you probably

01:45:31.280 --> 01:45:33.920
already know what Dance Central is all about, but if you want to check out the new engine,

01:45:33.920 --> 01:45:37.240
you can shake for free to Club Can't Handle Me.

01:45:37.240 --> 01:45:39.640
That's the David Guetta song, right, with Florida.

01:45:39.640 --> 01:45:43.240
And Bulletproof by LaRue.

01:45:43.240 --> 01:45:47.560
Also, the rest of the songs for the game have been announced.

01:45:47.560 --> 01:45:52.600
Among some of the highlights, or lowlights if you will, Justin Bieber with Somebody to

01:45:52.600 --> 01:45:53.600
Love.

01:45:53.600 --> 01:45:54.600
Yay.

01:45:54.600 --> 01:45:55.600
Lady Gaga with Bad Romance.

01:45:55.600 --> 01:45:56.600
Okay, that's cool.

01:45:56.600 --> 01:45:57.600
Little Boots.

01:45:57.600 --> 01:45:58.600
I like her.

01:45:58.600 --> 01:45:59.600
That song called Metal.

01:45:59.600 --> 01:46:00.600
That's pretty cool.

01:46:00.600 --> 01:46:02.160
Sean Kingston with Fire Burning.

01:46:02.160 --> 01:46:05.000
Tweet featuring Missy Elliott with Oops Oh My.

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:06.440
A cover version of Toxic.

01:46:06.440 --> 01:46:08.640
I guess Britney was too good.

01:46:08.640 --> 01:46:14.640
And coming to Dance Central 2, Willow with Whip My Hair.

01:46:14.640 --> 01:46:20.920
So lowkey, if you're planning on buying Dance Central 2, you'll hear that song once again.

01:46:20.920 --> 01:46:21.920
That's lame.

01:46:21.920 --> 01:46:22.920
Before you think.

01:46:22.920 --> 01:46:25.700
By the way, don't forget you can import all your Dance Central 1 songs into Dance Central

01:46:25.700 --> 01:46:26.700
2.

01:46:26.700 --> 01:46:28.560
I think there is like a, what, five or ten dollar import fee.

01:46:28.560 --> 01:46:29.560
Five bucks.

01:46:29.560 --> 01:46:30.560
That's not too bad, I guess.

01:46:30.560 --> 01:46:31.560
No.

01:46:31.560 --> 01:46:37.440
Lastly, but not leastly, this is of great importance to Orange Lounge Radio in our history.

01:46:37.440 --> 01:46:41.880
The website WhatTheyPlay.com has closed.

01:46:41.880 --> 01:46:48.160
I didn't know IGN owned it, but yeah, IGN owned WhatTheyPlay.com, and it is no more.

01:46:48.160 --> 01:46:51.900
On the Facebook page, I guess it was announced, well no, because they didn't really announce

01:46:51.900 --> 01:46:53.880
it since February, so whatever.

01:46:53.880 --> 01:46:58.360
I guess a closure notice went up or whatever, and now it just redirects to IGN.com.

01:46:58.360 --> 01:47:02.140
Why this is funny, you'll have to go check the Orange Lounge Radio wiki, but one of our

01:47:02.140 --> 01:47:09.040
very first dream games we ever came up with was a game called WhatTheyPlay.com Snap, and

01:47:09.040 --> 01:47:10.480
you know, you'll just kind of have to go read about it.

01:47:10.480 --> 01:47:16.040
It was our own little take on very offensive things in video games, according to this website,

01:47:16.040 --> 01:47:18.260
all in the form of Pokemon Snap.

01:47:18.260 --> 01:47:19.260
What was it?

01:47:19.260 --> 01:47:22.240
Wasn't it like two guys making out with a disembodied head, shouting fuck?

01:47:22.240 --> 01:47:25.700
Like I seem to recall the thing that was like so irritating about that poll was that people

01:47:25.700 --> 01:47:30.500
found two guys kissing more offensive than a severed head.

01:47:30.500 --> 01:47:37.560
So somehow that led to this whole discussion about WhatTheyPlay.com Snap, be it what it

01:47:37.560 --> 01:47:38.560
may.

01:47:38.560 --> 01:47:40.860
I don't even know what episode that was in, but I'm sure it's all on the wiki.

01:47:40.860 --> 01:47:47.080
The folks that update our wiki at OrangeLoungeRadio.wiki.com, they do a fantastic job archiving some of

01:47:47.080 --> 01:47:48.080
the shows and jokes.

01:47:48.080 --> 01:47:49.080
It's great.

01:47:49.080 --> 01:47:52.560
Slice and Pop, what do you have for us?

01:47:52.560 --> 01:47:58.700
Rock Band 3 is getting some new songs, mostly Rob Zombie and White Zombie, his project before

01:47:58.700 --> 01:48:01.520
he started putting stuff out under his own name.

01:48:01.520 --> 01:48:05.880
They're going to be available October 25th for about $2 a song.

01:48:05.880 --> 01:48:08.960
There are four of them in this update.

01:48:08.960 --> 01:48:15.840
For those that remember The Darkness, that kind of retro glam metal sort of kitschy gimmick

01:48:15.840 --> 01:48:20.840
band that was popular a little while ago with that song, I Believe in a Thing Called Love.

01:48:20.840 --> 01:48:24.840
The guy who was in the spandex jumpsuit, that song, it's a lot of fun.

01:48:24.840 --> 01:48:28.040
I can see people getting drunk and playing Rock Band to that.

01:48:28.040 --> 01:48:34.400
For Rob Zombie, Living Dead Girl, and then under the White Zombie name Thunder Kiss 65,

01:48:34.400 --> 01:48:41.320
which I seem to remember was a pretty badass song, and White Zombie's Super Charger Heaven.

01:48:41.320 --> 01:48:45.660
And also, Super Charger Heaven is often referred to as Devil Man, because that's what's in

01:48:45.660 --> 01:48:47.000
the chorus.

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:50.780
I was going to ask where More Human Than Human is, but I'm like almost positive that's already

01:48:50.780 --> 01:48:51.780
in the game.

01:48:51.780 --> 01:48:52.780
Yeah.

01:48:52.780 --> 01:48:55.320
Rock Band has a lot of songs.

01:48:55.320 --> 01:48:56.960
So very cool.

01:48:56.960 --> 01:49:02.760
In Peripheral News, if you remember that, I think it was from Famitsu Magazine a couple

01:49:02.760 --> 01:49:09.560
weeks or months ago, the caddy for the 3DS that you pop it into, and it has an extra

01:49:09.560 --> 01:49:12.640
right side analog thumby thing.

01:49:12.640 --> 01:49:17.020
And people were like, well does this mean that the 3DS is going to get a new version

01:49:17.020 --> 01:49:18.480
that doesn't have this as an add-on?

01:49:18.480 --> 01:49:20.520
It was always going to get a new version.

01:49:20.520 --> 01:49:21.520
Well yeah.

01:49:21.520 --> 01:49:22.980
It's Nintendo after all.

01:49:22.980 --> 01:49:31.440
So it was being bundled with Monster Hunter over in Japan, which is a huge Capcom franchise

01:49:31.440 --> 01:49:32.440
over there.

01:49:32.440 --> 01:49:34.480
I don't think it's nearly as popular over here.

01:49:34.480 --> 01:49:36.900
But we're getting it here in the US.

01:49:36.900 --> 01:49:45.120
They're saying that it's early 2012, whether that's Q1 or Q2 is what Capcom is forecasting.

01:49:45.120 --> 01:49:50.360
It will be available for the Resident Evil Revelations game, which is due out February

01:49:50.360 --> 01:49:51.360
7th of next year.

01:49:51.360 --> 01:49:53.920
So obviously by February 7th we're going to get this thing.

01:49:53.920 --> 01:49:55.880
Will a AAA battery be included?

01:49:55.880 --> 01:49:58.160
Because that's what this thing runs off of apparently.

01:49:58.160 --> 01:50:00.760
It doesn't know how to plug into your DS.

01:50:00.760 --> 01:50:05.060
The battery life on the 3DS is already pretty bad, especially if you have something open

01:50:05.060 --> 01:50:11.640
and then you just close the clamshell for sleep mode, your DS will die within an hour.

01:50:11.640 --> 01:50:17.920
So my understanding is that for whether it be Resident Evil Revelations or Monster Hunter,

01:50:17.920 --> 01:50:23.200
well it's nice to have this caddy thing with the extra right thumb analog thing that is

01:50:23.200 --> 01:50:25.240
not mandatory.

01:50:25.240 --> 01:50:31.680
So you can still play these games without the extra right side thing.

01:50:31.680 --> 01:50:35.040
And if you're thinking about getting a 3DS at this point you might want to wait because

01:50:35.040 --> 01:50:39.440
there's going to be I'm sure a redo next year that just has all this shit included.

01:50:39.440 --> 01:50:44.280
Unless you must play Mario Kart 7 or one of the other games that's coming out soon, which

01:50:44.280 --> 01:50:45.600
I can't say I blame you.

01:50:45.600 --> 01:50:47.760
I'm really excited about that Mario game to be honest.

01:50:47.760 --> 01:50:51.240
So for those of us that were, for the early adopters who thought that it was just a horrible

01:50:51.240 --> 01:50:53.640
nightmare and you were hallucinating, no it's real.

01:50:53.640 --> 01:50:55.520
It's real and we're getting it.

01:50:55.520 --> 01:50:59.400
And that's what you get, I'm kidding.

01:50:59.400 --> 01:51:05.680
Finally and I have maybe a little resentment that Rob gave me this story to report on,

01:51:05.680 --> 01:51:11.240
but Karaoke Revolution Glee Volume 3, it's the best show ever, oh my god what's going

01:51:11.240 --> 01:51:17.320
to happen with Mercedes, is coming out on the Xbox 360 and Wii November 22nd.

01:51:17.320 --> 01:51:19.760
Glee, glee, glee.

01:51:19.760 --> 01:51:21.760
Haven't the ratings for that show really dipped though?

01:51:21.760 --> 01:51:23.360
Like people are kind of getting over it.

01:51:23.360 --> 01:51:28.720
Like I heard that other Fox show, the Fox show with that one girl who just looks surprised,

01:51:28.720 --> 01:51:30.560
like she looks like a deer in the headlights all that.

01:51:30.560 --> 01:51:31.560
What's her name?

01:51:31.560 --> 01:51:32.560
Zoe?

01:51:32.560 --> 01:51:33.560
Zoe Deschanel.

01:51:33.560 --> 01:51:34.560
Yes, her.

01:51:34.560 --> 01:51:37.840
Her show is like beating glee and it comes on like after it or something.

01:51:37.840 --> 01:51:41.640
So like glee is like it's fading fast.

01:51:41.640 --> 01:51:44.000
It's one of those flash in the pan shows probably.

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:48.440
Yeah and of course Konami is putting this out obviously because it's Karaoke Revolution

01:51:48.440 --> 01:51:54.720
and the glee merchandise I think now is, and all the licensing and the glee brand and all

01:51:54.720 --> 01:51:59.240
the CDs and the shit that they put out is a bigger, probably it's a bigger brand than

01:51:59.240 --> 01:52:00.920
the actual series.

01:52:00.920 --> 01:52:04.040
All the crap that they're slapping the franchise onto.

01:52:04.040 --> 01:52:06.320
How many Sue Silvestres are you going to see this Halloween?

01:52:06.320 --> 01:52:11.280
And that's how Sue sees, I have to admit she was the only funny thing on that show as much

01:52:11.280 --> 01:52:14.140
of a cartoon as that character is.

01:52:14.140 --> 01:52:16.640
It's like the only reason to watch it.

01:52:16.640 --> 01:52:22.320
I could care less about white kids with problems.

01:52:22.320 --> 01:52:24.240
It was all about Sue Silvestre to me.

01:52:24.240 --> 01:52:27.600
So yeah, glee, Karaoke Revolution, whoop to shit.

01:52:27.600 --> 01:52:28.600
That's my last story.

01:52:28.600 --> 01:52:29.600
All right.

01:52:29.600 --> 01:52:33.400
And by the way, that's like the only way Karaoke Revolution lives on right now.

01:52:33.400 --> 01:52:38.040
I think that's the funniest thing out of all of it is that Karaoke Revolution, remember

01:52:38.040 --> 01:52:44.440
when Harmonix co-did the first Karaoke Revolution game and it was really this whole new thing?

01:52:44.440 --> 01:52:47.640
This is what your series turned into.

01:52:47.640 --> 01:52:51.360
Don't stop believin'.

01:52:51.360 --> 01:52:56.540
Hey, let's travel around and get some more news.

01:52:56.540 --> 01:52:59.280
We are also going to be coming up to the mailbag very soon.

01:52:59.280 --> 01:53:03.880
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us your emails and Twitter topics

01:53:03.880 --> 01:53:08.900
coming later as well as your last chance to get those in at Twitter.com slash O-L-R. So

01:53:08.900 --> 01:53:11.440
at O-L-R on Twitter.

01:53:11.440 --> 01:53:12.440
All right, Loki.

01:53:12.440 --> 01:53:18.120
Well, of course, everyone's always talking about what's going to be next for the Xbox

01:53:18.120 --> 01:53:19.120
and PlayStation.

01:53:19.120 --> 01:53:27.200
Well, of course, the rumor is that the next Xbox system is going to be slated for 2013.

01:53:27.200 --> 01:53:34.720
And they're saying with Nintendo revealing its Wii U console at E3, it's kind of pushed

01:53:34.720 --> 01:53:38.160
them to release their system faster.

01:53:38.160 --> 01:53:48.080
And apparently the site, well, the site develop is saying, their source is saying that apparently

01:53:48.080 --> 01:53:53.320
they have a source from the processor chip manufacturers to middleware firms that they're

01:53:53.320 --> 01:54:02.180
expecting an E3 2013 reveal of the console, followed by a launch later in the year.

01:54:02.180 --> 01:54:09.800
And it could be as far away as early 2014, which that's almost a 10-year life cycle.

01:54:09.800 --> 01:54:12.360
I mean, that's like eight, nine years.

01:54:12.360 --> 01:54:15.440
Yeah, it can't really get too fussy about eight years.

01:54:15.440 --> 01:54:16.440
That's a good run for me.

01:54:16.440 --> 01:54:21.560
Yeah, I mean, what, the PlayStation 1 was out in two, or the PlayStation, well, the

01:54:21.560 --> 01:54:23.440
PlayStation 1 was what, 96, 95?

01:54:23.440 --> 01:54:24.440
Yeah, I think 95.

01:54:24.440 --> 01:54:25.920
That was when Toshinden hit.

01:54:25.920 --> 01:54:28.120
And then PlayStation 2 was 2001.

01:54:28.120 --> 01:54:29.120
So that was...

01:54:29.120 --> 01:54:30.120
No, 2000.

01:54:30.120 --> 01:54:31.120
2000.

01:54:31.120 --> 01:54:32.120
Okay.

01:54:32.120 --> 01:54:33.120
It was nine...

01:54:33.120 --> 01:54:34.120
A five-year.

01:54:34.120 --> 01:54:35.120
Yeah.

01:54:35.120 --> 01:54:36.120
And then to the PlayStation 2 was 2006.

01:54:36.120 --> 01:54:37.120
God, I can't count.

01:54:37.120 --> 01:54:38.960
PlayStation 3 was 2006.

01:54:38.960 --> 01:54:40.320
So that was a six-year.

01:54:40.320 --> 01:54:44.160
So if this pushes, what, seven or eight, that's pretty good.

01:54:44.160 --> 01:54:48.200
The hardware is finally plateauing to the point where you can have sustainable graphics for

01:54:48.200 --> 01:54:49.200
eight years.

01:54:49.200 --> 01:54:50.200
That's great.

01:54:50.200 --> 01:54:54.640
I think, though, that the Xbox needs it more than the PlayStation.

01:54:54.640 --> 01:54:58.920
I still feel like the PlayStation's power hasn't been fully realized because a lot of

01:54:58.920 --> 01:54:59.920
people have to...

01:54:59.920 --> 01:55:02.800
I know this sounds so fanboyish, but hear me out, you guys.

01:55:02.800 --> 01:55:03.800
Let's be real.

01:55:03.800 --> 01:55:06.680
At the end of the day, the Blu-ray can hold more than the DVDs can.

01:55:06.680 --> 01:55:09.440
So I think that...

01:55:09.440 --> 01:55:12.680
I know it's slower and all that, but all those games install anyway.

01:55:12.680 --> 01:55:19.920
But I think that once the new Xbox comes out, then the PlayStation 3 is gonna be that bottom

01:55:19.920 --> 01:55:20.920
bar.

01:55:20.920 --> 01:55:23.440
But I think people will be able to really fill up those discs with textures and high

01:55:23.440 --> 01:55:25.160
resolutions and so forth.

01:55:25.160 --> 01:55:28.840
I kind of just think the PlayStation 3 hasn't fully been realized yet.

01:55:28.840 --> 01:55:29.840
So we'll see.

01:55:29.840 --> 01:55:34.540
And usually the renaissance of a certain system is usually the latter three or four years

01:55:34.540 --> 01:55:37.300
of its cycle rather than the first four.

01:55:37.300 --> 01:55:41.160
And it's not necessarily the end of the life cycle, because they could still be considering

01:55:41.160 --> 01:55:42.160
doing their 10-year life cycle.

01:55:42.160 --> 01:55:43.160
It can go...

01:55:43.160 --> 01:55:44.160
Oh, yeah.

01:55:44.160 --> 01:55:45.160
Because it's a thing of the PS2.

01:55:45.160 --> 01:55:46.160
Games came out for the PS2 forever.

01:55:46.160 --> 01:55:49.200
There's still games coming out for the PS2.

01:55:49.200 --> 01:55:52.360
So it could coexist with it for a few years after.

01:55:52.360 --> 01:55:56.240
I wouldn't be surprised to be able to push it over 10 years.

01:55:56.240 --> 01:55:57.240
So that's interesting.

01:55:57.240 --> 01:55:59.080
Well, that's the theory, at least.

01:55:59.080 --> 01:56:03.760
So I guess we'll have to wait and see, only a couple of years away before an announcement.

01:56:03.760 --> 01:56:06.880
I would imagine we'd get an announcement sooner than later anyways.

01:56:06.880 --> 01:56:11.360
Microsoft established with the 360 that you can actually come out first with a whole year

01:56:11.360 --> 01:56:13.120
of head time and still win.

01:56:13.120 --> 01:56:14.740
Well, what am I...

01:56:14.740 --> 01:56:19.240
Why am I thinking it's between the 360 and the PS3 when the Wii has outsold both of them?

01:56:19.240 --> 01:56:23.840
I was going to say, because usually the console that came out first was the one that fell

01:56:23.840 --> 01:56:24.880
on its ass.

01:56:24.880 --> 01:56:28.780
Because we're all looking at the Wii U going, you know, maybe lightning's not going to strike

01:56:28.780 --> 01:56:31.120
twice this time.

01:56:31.120 --> 01:56:32.120
That's why.

01:56:32.120 --> 01:56:33.120
You know what?

01:56:33.120 --> 01:56:38.320
Seriously, the Wii U, I'm kind of disappointed with the fact that they aren't going to try

01:56:38.320 --> 01:56:44.000
to up the graphics to, yeah, okay, it's slightly better than 360.

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:48.040
It's going to have to be slightly better than that because the 360's going to be done with

01:56:48.040 --> 01:56:50.000
by the time that it comes out.

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:55.880
So if it's a good system, Microsoft can have a year head star on everyone and win, ultimately,

01:56:55.880 --> 01:56:57.440
the market.

01:56:57.440 --> 01:57:02.600
I mean, Nintendo will have a chance, though, at next year's E3 to really wow the shit out

01:57:02.600 --> 01:57:03.600
of us.

01:57:03.600 --> 01:57:07.560
I mean, the nice thing about where Nintendo's going, they get a second chance.

01:57:07.560 --> 01:57:12.240
So next year, if they can do it, they can put out games that have fucking sweet graphics

01:57:12.240 --> 01:57:14.880
that use this whole tablet thing that just blow our fucking mind.

01:57:14.880 --> 01:57:15.880
Like, they have a chance.

01:57:15.880 --> 01:57:18.160
I've got a prediction for you.

01:57:18.160 --> 01:57:20.460
It's not going to be ready for next year.

01:57:20.460 --> 01:57:21.460
It's not going to be ready.

01:57:21.460 --> 01:57:22.460
You think.

01:57:22.460 --> 01:57:23.460
You're calling the Wii U delay already.

01:57:23.460 --> 01:57:25.540
Wii U is not coming out in 2012.

01:57:25.540 --> 01:57:26.540
You think.

01:57:26.540 --> 01:57:28.440
And do you think it's because of its cold reception?

01:57:28.440 --> 01:57:29.860
I think it's because they got nothing.

01:57:29.860 --> 01:57:30.860
They have nothing.

01:57:30.860 --> 01:57:33.080
They have a bunch of tech demos and that's it.

01:57:33.080 --> 01:57:34.200
Proof of concept, that's it.

01:57:34.200 --> 01:57:35.260
Here's the problem.

01:57:35.260 --> 01:57:40.240
If the 3DS doesn't make a recovery this holiday, and I don't know, I still think it's too early

01:57:40.240 --> 01:57:41.240
to say.

01:57:41.240 --> 01:57:43.840
The Wii U, the Mario Kart, and the Mario games are going to go a long way in putting these

01:57:43.840 --> 01:57:46.000
things under kids' Christmas trees this year.

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:51.200
But if the 3DS doesn't gain a lot of steam quickly, what are they going to have next

01:57:51.200 --> 01:57:53.200
year?

01:57:53.200 --> 01:57:55.140
Nothing.

01:57:55.140 --> 01:57:58.640
It's going to really put pressure on to get the Wii U out or they're going to have to

01:57:58.640 --> 01:58:00.440
give in to investors and start making iPhone games.

01:58:00.440 --> 01:58:01.440
Yeah.

01:58:01.440 --> 01:58:02.440
But see, when they're going to be...

01:58:02.440 --> 01:58:03.440
Yeah, but that's the thing.

01:58:03.440 --> 01:58:07.780
If they're going to rush the Wii U, come on.

01:58:07.780 --> 01:58:11.080
We're going to see these games that, oh, we were developing this for the Wii, but we decided

01:58:11.080 --> 01:58:15.360
to put it on the Wii U type situation.

01:58:15.360 --> 01:58:16.360
And I know that...

01:58:16.360 --> 01:58:17.360
Like the last story.

01:58:17.360 --> 01:58:24.040
Nintendo has been the more family-friendly, affordable model since, really, the N64.

01:58:24.040 --> 01:58:27.520
I don't like the fact that the tablet controller is a terminal.

01:58:27.520 --> 01:58:29.320
It doesn't have any processor in it.

01:58:29.320 --> 01:58:31.280
It's simply a screen.

01:58:31.280 --> 01:58:35.000
I think Nintendo needs to realize that people are fucking buying iPads for their goddamn

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:37.560
kids and iPads aren't fucking cheap.

01:58:37.560 --> 01:58:41.120
You can make your console more expensive and people will still buy it.

01:58:41.120 --> 01:58:42.680
They're not going to go, oh my god.

01:58:42.680 --> 01:58:43.680
Don't give them too many ideas.

01:58:43.680 --> 01:58:48.760
Well, I understand that, but I'm just saying, you know, if you're buying a fucking $200

01:58:48.760 --> 01:58:56.680
piece of equipment for your child, I mean, shit, I think they will spend $300 on a console.

01:58:56.680 --> 01:59:01.960
Brad from PotCulture's in our chat room and wants me to make a bet with Loki.

01:59:01.960 --> 01:59:02.960
Stop it.

01:59:02.960 --> 01:59:03.960
Stop it, okay?

01:59:03.960 --> 01:59:07.280
You had your chance and you blew it.

01:59:07.280 --> 01:59:14.240
All you had to do was generate a few sales, a few hundred thousand sales of, you know,

01:59:14.240 --> 01:59:18.200
I have judgment, and that was it, and then you would have had it.

01:59:18.200 --> 01:59:24.880
But see, the Wii U does sound ridiculous, but once again, it's something like, all these

01:59:24.880 --> 01:59:26.480
developers are so excited.

01:59:26.480 --> 01:59:31.640
I think that these developers seriously don't get enough sun because it's, oh wow, it's

01:59:31.640 --> 01:59:32.640
a tablet that interacts-

01:59:32.640 --> 01:59:34.480
Do you think they all have vitamin D deficiencies?

01:59:34.480 --> 01:59:37.520
It's like it's a tablet that interacts with this console.

01:59:37.520 --> 01:59:39.640
Dude, they've got like tablets-

01:59:39.640 --> 01:59:41.560
And the tablet does shit by itself.

01:59:41.560 --> 01:59:44.560
You need the console tethered to it.

01:59:44.560 --> 01:59:45.840
But you know what, though?

01:59:45.840 --> 01:59:51.960
It's not, you say that like it's a bad thing, but look at like, you know, the on-live stuff.

01:59:51.960 --> 01:59:57.920
It's a console that interacts with a server that basically streams the gaming to it.

01:59:57.920 --> 01:59:58.920
True.

01:59:58.920 --> 02:00:00.180
That's the same thing.

02:00:00.180 --> 02:00:05.000
But once again, I'm like, that tablet looks stupid.

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:09.520
And yeah, ooh goody, we can put my, you know, my inventory down on this.

02:00:09.520 --> 02:00:13.380
You know what, you could do that also with the 3, you know, the DS or something.

02:00:13.380 --> 02:00:17.640
You can have it where it interacts with the actual consoles on, you know, the DS could

02:00:17.640 --> 02:00:18.640
do that.

02:00:18.640 --> 02:00:20.520
Same with the 3DS could do that.

02:00:20.520 --> 02:00:22.440
But they didn't fucking do that.

02:00:22.440 --> 02:00:29.200
I don't know, it's just, they're gonna need a lot more than what they've got.

02:00:29.200 --> 02:00:34.480
Alright, let's move on to a game that's supposed to be on the Wii U when it comes out.

02:00:34.480 --> 02:00:35.480
Arkham City.

02:00:35.480 --> 02:00:38.280
Now, people have been going apeshit for this game.

02:00:38.280 --> 02:00:42.440
I haven't played it, but I've watched Dan play a little bit of it.

02:00:42.440 --> 02:00:44.560
And it did look pretty fucking sweet, I gotta say.

02:00:44.560 --> 02:00:46.160
And like, you know, I like Batman.

02:00:46.160 --> 02:00:50.360
I don't know why I didn't buy this game at launch, but I guess I'm just not, I'm not

02:00:50.360 --> 02:00:54.120
usually very good at the 3D action games, I think that's kind of part of it.

02:00:54.120 --> 02:00:59.000
But there's a part of me that's going kind of want with this game.

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:03.960
But then I read this crap, and I go, maybe I shouldn't buy it right away.

02:01:03.960 --> 02:01:07.840
Remember how we've been talking about Project $10 applies to this game, and it's not even

02:01:07.840 --> 02:01:08.840
multiplayer.

02:01:08.840 --> 02:01:09.840
No, they've done the Catwoman.

02:01:09.840 --> 02:01:11.900
Well, they have to run the servers!

02:01:11.900 --> 02:01:14.560
You understand, they have to run the servers!

02:01:14.560 --> 02:01:15.560
Think of the servers!

02:01:15.560 --> 02:01:18.720
You know what really, the only thing that ticks me off about the whole thing is that

02:01:18.720 --> 02:01:23.160
they really made Catwoman sound like she was an integral part of the game, and like it's

02:01:23.160 --> 02:01:24.160
all part of it.

02:01:24.160 --> 02:01:25.760
And now it's DLC.

02:01:25.760 --> 02:01:27.000
You know, essentially.

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:31.120
Which I'm fine, you know, it's not like it's the first time we've seen a game come with

02:01:31.120 --> 02:01:32.380
DLC in it.

02:01:32.380 --> 02:01:33.880
That happens a lot now.

02:01:33.880 --> 02:01:39.240
You know, it's just the whole, you know, buy the game new incentive, whatever.

02:01:39.240 --> 02:01:42.240
But paid unlocked content, because that was a key.

02:01:42.240 --> 02:01:46.800
No, I don't, I think it's like a, I was listening to Bobby show earlier, and one of his callers

02:01:46.800 --> 02:01:48.720
said it was a 200 megabyte download.

02:01:48.720 --> 02:01:49.720
Really?

02:01:49.720 --> 02:01:50.720
Yeah.

02:01:50.720 --> 02:01:52.080
So it must come with others, alright.

02:01:52.080 --> 02:01:54.160
Do some investigative reporting, Loki.

02:01:54.160 --> 02:01:56.260
Meanwhile, okay, here's the deal.

02:01:56.260 --> 02:01:59.200
The thing that kind of, you know, ticked me off and made me go, maybe I shouldn't have

02:01:59.200 --> 02:02:00.200
rushed into this.

02:02:00.200 --> 02:02:04.080
Apparently, those download codes are showing up, and they don't work.

02:02:04.080 --> 02:02:06.840
Some of them don't work, some of them are just fucking blank.

02:02:06.840 --> 02:02:10.780
And there's a picture circulating around the internet of cards that went into boxes with

02:02:10.780 --> 02:02:12.280
no codes on them.

02:02:12.280 --> 02:02:16.160
And actually, from a factory production standpoint, this makes a lot of sense.

02:02:16.160 --> 02:02:19.560
They probably have an assembly line and a machine that picks up these cards and runs

02:02:19.560 --> 02:02:23.640
them through a printer, and the machine probably, if it picks up two at a time on accident,

02:02:23.640 --> 02:02:24.960
which is bound to happen.

02:02:24.960 --> 02:02:27.880
Why this ever can't happen to me at the ATM machine, I don't know.

02:02:27.880 --> 02:02:31.840
But in the factory, it picks up two at a time, and then one of them doesn't get a code, yet

02:02:31.840 --> 02:02:33.440
still goes in the game.

02:02:33.440 --> 02:02:34.800
So yeah.

02:02:34.800 --> 02:02:38.280
So it was going out there, and these people that were looking forward to playing as Catwoman

02:02:38.280 --> 02:02:39.680
were kind of screwed.

02:02:39.680 --> 02:02:43.960
However, Warner does have a five-step process to get this fixed.

02:02:43.960 --> 02:02:45.120
Alright, fair enough.

02:02:45.120 --> 02:02:46.880
It was a couple hundred meg download.

02:02:46.880 --> 02:02:47.880
Alright.

02:02:47.880 --> 02:02:48.880
So be it.

02:02:48.880 --> 02:02:52.880
Alright, so apparently you call customer service, and you give them a dated proof of purchase,

02:02:52.880 --> 02:02:57.680
like a receipt, that shows a new copy of the game, not eBay or not rented.

02:02:57.680 --> 02:03:02.920
You have to give your gamer tag for Xbox Live or PSN, you have to give your email address,

02:03:02.920 --> 02:03:07.840
a scan or digital picture of the package and game disk, and the scan or digital picture

02:03:07.840 --> 02:03:08.840
of the code sheet.

02:03:08.840 --> 02:03:11.280
Once you send all that in, they'll give you the code.

02:03:11.280 --> 02:03:13.480
That's a lot of work for their mistake.

02:03:13.480 --> 02:03:14.880
I know, right?

02:03:14.880 --> 02:03:17.320
I seem to recall last time a developer fucked up.

02:03:17.320 --> 02:03:19.480
Wasn't it Deus Ex that had this problem?

02:03:19.480 --> 02:03:24.520
One of those had a code, and it got fucked up, so they just ended up having to give it

02:03:24.520 --> 02:03:25.520
to everybody.

02:03:25.520 --> 02:03:26.520
It was Driver.

02:03:26.520 --> 02:03:27.520
It was Driver.

02:03:27.520 --> 02:03:28.520
It was Driver.

02:03:28.520 --> 02:03:30.520
Driver, they forgot to put the code in one of the packages.

02:03:30.520 --> 02:03:35.080
I think it was 360 or PS3, I can't remember, it was one of those two.

02:03:35.080 --> 02:03:39.880
They forgot to put in the Uplay code.

02:03:39.880 --> 02:03:44.360
But this is apparently like, people, this is going back to the days of when people would

02:03:44.360 --> 02:03:48.320
call in sick to work and stay up all night to play a video game.

02:03:48.320 --> 02:03:50.680
This game is having that effect on people.

02:03:50.680 --> 02:03:55.880
People that I know that aren't even that into video games are just going apeshit crazy over

02:03:55.880 --> 02:03:56.880
this.

02:03:56.880 --> 02:04:02.360
And trust me, people, if you really want to get this free code and maybe purchase a used

02:04:02.360 --> 02:04:08.840
copy already, I mean, come on, you need a picture of the packed shot and a receipt?

02:04:08.840 --> 02:04:12.240
I think we can find one on Google Image Search.

02:04:12.240 --> 02:04:13.720
I love this.

02:04:13.720 --> 02:04:18.600
Tigerclaw linked a picture in chatroom of a midnight launch at his local Evil G, and

02:04:18.600 --> 02:04:23.320
one of the employees is dressed up as the Joker with the why so serious makeup.

02:04:23.320 --> 02:04:27.160
At least people are getting into it.

02:04:27.160 --> 02:04:28.160
Lol.

02:04:28.160 --> 02:04:30.240
Shame on you for giving that place your business.

02:04:30.240 --> 02:04:31.800
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

02:04:31.800 --> 02:04:36.260
This is where I'm going to get in my sandbox once again about this whole code crap.

02:04:36.260 --> 02:04:42.160
So I would like to pose this question, and I'm sure no developers of these types of games

02:04:42.160 --> 02:04:46.540
actually listen to this show, but maybe after we hopefully win the podcast awards, someone

02:04:46.540 --> 02:04:50.800
will go back in the archives and hear my rant.

02:04:50.800 --> 02:04:58.200
So I always hear the complaint, or I should say the argument from people in favor of these

02:04:58.200 --> 02:05:05.240
$10 codes and online passes and stuff, well, the developers don't get any money from used

02:05:05.240 --> 02:05:06.240
sales.

02:05:06.240 --> 02:05:10.760
They just don't get any money, and those servers cost money to maintain blah blah blah blah

02:05:10.760 --> 02:05:11.760
blah.

02:05:11.760 --> 02:05:15.520
Okay, developers, how much of that $10 do you actually get?

02:05:15.520 --> 02:05:21.800
Because I'm going to be willing to bet that you get nothing from those $10 vouchers that

02:05:21.800 --> 02:05:24.340
get redeemed or whatever.

02:05:24.340 --> 02:05:30.760
I'm betting it's $0 is what you get, and it all goes to the publisher to pad their numbers,

02:05:30.760 --> 02:05:35.060
and yeah, some of that I'm sure will go to running their servers, because hey, if you

02:05:35.060 --> 02:05:40.280
can run your servers cheaper than you are now, then why not?

02:05:40.280 --> 02:05:46.920
But I mean, it's just an excuse, and no, I'm sure buying these games used is not going

02:05:46.920 --> 02:05:53.240
to make or break a publisher as far as that goes, because I'm being willing to bet that

02:05:53.240 --> 02:05:57.520
none of that money goes to the developers, all probably to the publishers.

02:05:57.520 --> 02:05:58.520
You want proof.

02:05:58.520 --> 02:06:00.560
I want to see the receipts.

02:06:00.560 --> 02:06:05.400
I want someone to say, hey, we get a buck for each time someone buys this thing.

02:06:05.400 --> 02:06:07.960
That's what I'd like to see, but I doubt it.

02:06:07.960 --> 02:06:11.000
I doubt that they get very much money from that.

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:12.720
All right.

02:06:12.720 --> 02:06:15.220
Let's move on to the mailbag.

02:06:15.220 --> 02:06:19.780
Every week you guys send us emails at mailbag at orangelauncheradio.com.

02:06:19.780 --> 02:06:24.000
Now normally DarkSakura will dive into the email bag head first and pull out some of

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:25.840
her favorite emails to read on air.

02:06:25.840 --> 02:06:31.000
However, as you guys are aware, she's not here tonight, so she has asked SalaciousPop

02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:35.040
to put on the biohazard suit and jump in there on her behalf.

02:06:35.040 --> 02:06:38.280
So SalaciousPop, what's in the emails tonight?

02:06:38.280 --> 02:06:43.260
First email tonight is from Robert M and he writes, evening, you probably already got

02:06:43.260 --> 02:06:48.680
feedback about this, but the free downloadable Zelda Four Swords is not a 3DS exclusive,

02:06:48.680 --> 02:06:51.800
but it's available on the DSI models as well.

02:06:51.800 --> 02:06:56.040
I am very glad to see that they added a single player mode, allowing the player to have a

02:06:56.040 --> 02:06:59.880
second link, follow him around and switch control to either character.

02:06:59.880 --> 02:07:04.020
Overall this is the kind of effort Nintendo should be putting into its rereleases.

02:07:04.020 --> 02:07:07.440
Now onto toys!

02:07:07.440 --> 02:07:14.560
I have had and not had an interest in Spyro since the Insomniac days, and while I sympathize

02:07:14.560 --> 02:07:20.480
with the storage issues and definitely the high buy-in, the concept of Skylander seems

02:07:20.480 --> 02:07:25.800
kind of cool, even though I'm sure the game itself would probably be fairly simplistic.

02:07:25.800 --> 02:07:30.980
I've seen other game-slash-toys like this, although those were probably an in-package

02:07:30.980 --> 02:07:35.560
code rather than direct peripheral transfer of memory.

02:07:35.560 --> 02:07:40.240
Some online racing games with toy cars, and some MMO called Freaky Creatures whose action

02:07:40.240 --> 02:07:42.200
figures I've seen at Best Buy.

02:07:42.200 --> 02:07:45.480
I haven't seen either of these in stores for a while though.

02:07:45.480 --> 02:07:49.840
I haven't seen as much integration with my Transformers action figures, a line here and

02:07:49.840 --> 02:07:54.880
there may have a catalog with a code for an unlockable in one of the games, but these

02:07:54.880 --> 02:07:57.880
are rare and all the catalogs have the same code.

02:07:57.880 --> 02:08:03.440
My question is, have you seen a more successful toy game integration?

02:08:03.440 --> 02:08:08.920
Would you call those music games toys, like the plastic guitars, are those toys?

02:08:08.920 --> 02:08:10.920
It kind of depends on your definition of toy.

02:08:10.920 --> 02:08:17.880
Well I think what he's asking is, what was that card game for the Sony that bombed that

02:08:17.880 --> 02:08:18.880
never came out?

02:08:18.880 --> 02:08:19.880
Eye of Judgment?

02:08:19.880 --> 02:08:21.460
Yeah, Eye of Judgment.

02:08:21.460 --> 02:08:25.640
That's where you're kind of buying a physical thing to bring into the game.

02:08:25.640 --> 02:08:28.560
With the Skylanders you have to find these little action figures to play that character

02:08:28.560 --> 02:08:29.560
in the game.

02:08:29.560 --> 02:08:31.560
So what have there been that's similar to that?

02:08:31.560 --> 02:08:36.780
Well you have to go from the disc generations forward because obviously with the cartridge

02:08:36.780 --> 02:08:39.000
scenario that just didn't happen.

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:45.500
I remember old school VCR games that tied in with toys, but that stuff didn't work very

02:08:45.500 --> 02:08:49.560
well and it was all just for show in the commercials and stuff.

02:08:49.560 --> 02:08:54.160
But as far as toys with games, I'm not sure.

02:08:54.160 --> 02:08:58.520
And Loki, can you think of anything, any type of, like where they sold toys that integrated

02:08:58.520 --> 02:09:00.040
with the game like this does?

02:09:00.040 --> 02:09:01.040
That integrated the game?

02:09:01.040 --> 02:09:02.040
Yeah.

02:09:02.040 --> 02:09:08.640
Connectimals, they had little scans where you can basically interact with different,

02:09:08.640 --> 02:09:12.240
you know, you can buy toys, or they had collector's editions that came with stuffed animals they

02:09:12.240 --> 02:09:14.840
could play with the actual game with.

02:09:14.840 --> 02:09:18.040
Viva Pinata had some stuff.

02:09:18.040 --> 02:09:19.040
Did Viva Pinata have that?

02:09:19.040 --> 02:09:21.320
Yeah, they had a little thing where you could scan your...

02:09:21.320 --> 02:09:25.200
Yeah, they so tried to make Viva Pinata happen.

02:09:25.200 --> 02:09:27.380
They tried, it wasn't going to happen.

02:09:27.380 --> 02:09:30.520
Some people enjoyed it, some people really did, but like remember they had the cartoon,

02:09:30.520 --> 02:09:33.960
they were really trying to make an empire out of that and it just...

02:09:33.960 --> 02:09:38.320
If you want to count Babysitting Mama, because Babysitting Mama had the doll that you shoved

02:09:38.320 --> 02:09:43.640
the Wii remote up into its nether regions and would interact that way.

02:09:43.640 --> 02:09:47.120
Don't worry, Mama will fix it.

02:09:47.120 --> 02:09:48.600
Let's see, what else?

02:09:48.600 --> 02:09:49.600
There was...

02:09:49.600 --> 02:09:53.280
Cat rooms yelling Captain Power, I think that's what they're thinking of the VCR stuff I'm

02:09:53.280 --> 02:09:54.280
talking about.

02:09:54.280 --> 02:09:55.280
Oh, wow.

02:09:55.280 --> 02:09:56.280
Right?

02:09:56.280 --> 02:09:57.940
Yeah, I remember that.

02:09:57.940 --> 02:09:59.640
That was kind of like a rich kid's toy.

02:09:59.640 --> 02:10:01.760
That shit was, well that shit was cheap as hell, though.

02:10:01.760 --> 02:10:10.320
I didn't ever own one, but you know, I had the rich friends, and so, you know, they did.

02:10:10.320 --> 02:10:14.460
That's what you do when you're poor, you make friends with rich people.

02:10:14.460 --> 02:10:16.400
Through your sass and wit.

02:10:16.400 --> 02:10:21.640
Alright, Salacious Pop, what's next?

02:10:21.640 --> 02:10:29.080
Chiggers writes asking, rather, asking Dark Sakura, who's not here, an update on her PlayStation

02:10:29.080 --> 02:10:30.320
tester application.

02:10:30.320 --> 02:10:33.880
I can actually give you that, even though Dark Sakura's not here tonight.

02:10:33.880 --> 02:10:37.680
She decided not to go through with it, and it was a discussion between her and Dan about

02:10:37.680 --> 02:10:40.900
the whole, like, if I actually got it, I have to relocate.

02:10:40.900 --> 02:10:43.600
Keep in mind, Dan just recently got employed again.

02:10:43.600 --> 02:10:47.760
He was working a game crazy up until they all went under, and he's employed again, so

02:10:47.760 --> 02:10:51.800
they made a personal decision that it's just not the right time for Dark Sakura to do that.

02:10:51.800 --> 02:10:56.040
As funny as it would have been, she has to think not just for herself.

02:10:56.040 --> 02:11:01.720
You know, she has a husband, so they didn't go through with it, which is too bad.

02:11:01.720 --> 02:11:04.800
Unfortunately, Salacious Pop's application got in too late, right?

02:11:04.800 --> 02:11:06.680
No, I'm just kidding.

02:11:06.680 --> 02:11:07.680
Just messing.

02:11:07.680 --> 02:11:11.440
I just want to see you go on that show and claw some 21-year-old's eyes out for being

02:11:11.440 --> 02:11:12.440
a bitch.

02:11:12.440 --> 02:11:14.240
Yeah, I'm probably too old.

02:11:14.240 --> 02:11:15.240
I'm sure it's like on...

02:11:15.240 --> 02:11:16.240
You'd be Grandpa on that show.

02:11:16.240 --> 02:11:17.240
Because on the...

02:11:17.240 --> 02:11:22.480
There's usually one or two people in their 30s that are in the cast somehow, but yeah.

02:11:22.480 --> 02:11:29.480
They have one that I watched just because, and it was just the part of it, because Freddie

02:11:29.480 --> 02:11:33.120
Wong is in it briefly.

02:11:33.120 --> 02:11:36.480
He posted it on his Facebook page, but it's like some battlefield thing called the Controller.

02:11:36.480 --> 02:11:41.240
It's a bunch of these noobs team up with, like, these pro gamers, and they have to play

02:11:41.240 --> 02:11:42.560
Battlefield 3.

02:11:42.560 --> 02:11:45.000
It's basically a big advertisement for Battlefield 3.

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:49.960
But yeah, all those shows are dumb.

02:11:49.960 --> 02:11:52.520
Tester.

02:11:52.520 --> 02:11:54.680
You can test games for the PlayStation 4!

02:11:54.680 --> 02:11:57.200
No, remember, the next one had a different prize.

02:11:57.200 --> 02:11:59.840
It's not about just the game testing now.

02:11:59.840 --> 02:12:01.780
They sweetened the deal a little bit.

02:12:01.780 --> 02:12:03.280
The prize sounds a lot better.

02:12:03.280 --> 02:12:06.520
And we'll kick you in the nuts!

02:12:06.520 --> 02:12:09.240
I don't know what happened to the second guy that won.

02:12:09.240 --> 02:12:10.840
I know a gay guy won the second season.

02:12:10.840 --> 02:12:12.960
His handle was, like, gamer.

02:12:12.960 --> 02:12:16.000
And I haven't heard a lot about what happened to him, but I knew the guy that won the first

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:20.760
season actually only tested for, like, six months, and he moved into the part at Sony

02:12:20.760 --> 02:12:22.920
that he really wanted to do.

02:12:22.920 --> 02:12:25.660
That whole thing was really about just getting your foot in the damn door.

02:12:25.660 --> 02:12:28.800
But I'd be curious about did they hire anyone else from the shows.

02:12:28.800 --> 02:12:31.960
You know how sometimes, like, American Idol, right?

02:12:31.960 --> 02:12:33.160
Chris Daughtry didn't win.

02:12:33.160 --> 02:12:35.800
If you're in the top three, you're getting a record deal.

02:12:35.800 --> 02:12:36.800
Exactly.

02:12:36.800 --> 02:12:37.800
Exactly.

02:12:37.800 --> 02:12:38.800
Yeah.

02:12:38.800 --> 02:12:44.040
Uh, next email is from Jam J. Jam J writes, Holy shit, I haven't heard that name in forever.

02:12:44.040 --> 02:12:47.080
That guy used to show up live a lot.

02:12:47.080 --> 02:12:56.080
This week, I picked up Rocksmith for the 360, a, uh, I'm not sure, a 14 to USB connector

02:12:56.080 --> 02:12:58.080
for the guitar was included.

02:12:58.080 --> 02:13:03.440
My thoughts on the game itself is that it is more of a training slash drill tool than

02:13:03.440 --> 02:13:07.280
game, and then parentheses, number cruncher, or number munchers.

02:13:07.280 --> 02:13:12.220
For many, this would be a turnoff, but as an extreme novice at guitar, I found it was

02:13:12.220 --> 02:13:16.120
decent and made otherwise boring practice a bit better.

02:13:16.120 --> 02:13:20.660
The game functions as an amplifier for the guitar and has a free mode where you can just

02:13:20.660 --> 02:13:22.280
free play your guitar.

02:13:22.280 --> 02:13:26.120
I would recommend Rocksmith for those that want to learn a bit of guitar, but aren't

02:13:26.120 --> 02:13:30.520
taking normal lessons or excuse me, aren't taking formal lessons.

02:13:30.520 --> 02:13:34.700
One of the drawbacks is that you have to grind songs repetitively, repetitively in order

02:13:34.700 --> 02:13:36.360
to open up new modes.

02:13:36.360 --> 02:13:39.840
However, it does make you practice.

02:13:39.840 --> 02:13:44.180
After the 30 minutes of, after the 30 minutes of starting the game, I found I was able to

02:13:44.180 --> 02:13:49.120
play a simplified version of Satisfaction, which wasn't bad at all.

02:13:49.120 --> 02:13:52.320
I used a basic Strat style electric guitar.

02:13:52.320 --> 02:13:55.920
Rocksmith will work with any electric guitar with a quarter, oh, that's probably a quarter

02:13:55.920 --> 02:13:58.120
inch, with a quarter inch jack.

02:13:58.120 --> 02:14:02.720
I give this game the Tomato Frog stamp of approval for learning basic guitar.

02:14:02.720 --> 02:14:03.720
GMJ.

02:14:03.720 --> 02:14:05.640
Well, that actually is not a bad review.

02:14:05.640 --> 02:14:10.240
You know, I like that he says it's more of a tool than a game.

02:14:10.240 --> 02:14:15.280
And I'd be curious to see how much this catches on, if at all.

02:14:15.280 --> 02:14:19.840
I mean, I think people are like, they're just too ready to throw it into the rock band and

02:14:19.840 --> 02:14:22.680
guitar hero pile than to see what it really is.

02:14:22.680 --> 02:14:26.840
But I appreciate the review because this was something that I don't, I gotta admit, I don't

02:14:26.840 --> 02:14:30.880
really have a super duper interest in learning to play the guitar, but it sounds like a neat

02:14:30.880 --> 02:14:32.120
way to learn.

02:14:32.120 --> 02:14:37.480
I'm more of a keyboard person, keep in mind, piano, that stuff.

02:14:37.480 --> 02:14:43.760
And our last email of the evening is from Fabrice in Belgium and he writes, hello, OLR.

02:14:43.760 --> 02:14:47.160
I love international emails, just saying.

02:14:47.160 --> 02:14:51.720
I went to my very first sci-fi convention last Saturday and it was simply amazing.

02:14:51.720 --> 02:14:54.340
The people cosplaying just blew my mind away.

02:14:54.340 --> 02:14:59.080
Most of their costumes were made that well and they played their part with so much conviction.

02:14:59.080 --> 02:15:02.000
Wow, it really made a big impression on me.

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:06.880
The overall atmosphere and friendship between cosplayers made me, made me consider to cosplay

02:15:06.880 --> 02:15:07.880
myself.

02:15:07.880 --> 02:15:12.520
I didn't see anyone cosplaying Pyramid Head, I'm thinking about filling up that gap next

02:15:12.520 --> 02:15:14.560
year on this convention.

02:15:14.560 --> 02:15:18.640
Although I don't know too much about him, I've never had a chance, I've never had a

02:15:18.640 --> 02:15:20.040
chance to play Silent Hill.

02:15:20.040 --> 02:15:22.920
He looks like such a badass character.

02:15:22.920 --> 02:15:24.760
And then I have Halloween's coming.

02:15:24.760 --> 02:15:26.680
You really should check out Silent Hill, just saying.

02:15:26.680 --> 02:15:28.700
I have something to whine about too.

02:15:28.700 --> 02:15:32.500
It seems that every single game has downloadable content nowadays.

02:15:32.500 --> 02:15:37.640
As I was randomly going through the Xbox Live Marketplace, I saw there was even downloadable

02:15:37.640 --> 02:15:41.720
content for such a small and simple game as Fruit Ninja Connect.

02:15:41.720 --> 02:15:45.720
I do get that developers and publishers want to make some more extra money, but it's just

02:15:45.720 --> 02:15:46.720
crazy.

02:15:46.720 --> 02:15:50.080
It feels more and more like content that should be included in the game when you first buy

02:15:50.080 --> 02:15:52.280
it.

02:15:52.280 --> 02:15:56.400
In two years time, if this trend continues, we will only buy half games for the full price.

02:15:56.400 --> 02:16:00.160
I hate to say it, this trend's already been going for a long time, and a lot of this is,

02:16:00.160 --> 02:16:02.640
you know, IOS has a lot of this too.

02:16:02.640 --> 02:16:06.040
This is just kind of the world we live in right now, and you really have to vote with

02:16:06.040 --> 02:16:07.080
your dollars.

02:16:07.080 --> 02:16:09.040
Don't buy half-assed games.

02:16:09.040 --> 02:16:10.040
Don't.

02:16:10.040 --> 02:16:11.040
Do your research.

02:16:11.040 --> 02:16:14.220
Well, as always, thanks a lot for making the show every week.

02:16:14.220 --> 02:16:15.480
You guys really are awesome.

02:16:15.480 --> 02:16:18.640
I'm voting almost every day for you guys for the podcast awards.

02:16:18.640 --> 02:16:20.320
That's the least I can do for you.

02:16:20.320 --> 02:16:21.680
Aw, shucks.

02:16:21.680 --> 02:16:22.680
Shucks.

02:16:22.680 --> 02:16:23.680
Thanks so much.

02:16:23.680 --> 02:16:24.680
Fabrice in Belgium.

02:16:24.680 --> 02:16:25.720
Really appreciate it, Fabrice.

02:16:25.720 --> 02:16:29.160
You know, his story about the sci-fi convention and all the excitement that kind of went with

02:16:29.160 --> 02:16:30.160
that and kind of...

02:16:30.160 --> 02:16:32.780
I bet a lot of that excitement is just being with other nerds.

02:16:32.780 --> 02:16:37.560
I know that, like, my first E3 was a lot like that, was, like, all these professional people

02:16:37.560 --> 02:16:39.960
that really happen to be, like, big fucking nerds like me.

02:16:39.960 --> 02:16:40.960
Like, I just...

02:16:40.960 --> 02:16:44.800
I loved my first E3, and I don't think I'll ever go to one as good as that because of

02:16:44.800 --> 02:16:45.800
that.

02:16:45.800 --> 02:16:48.360
But, like, it just reminded me of some other thing I read this week.

02:16:48.360 --> 02:16:49.360
Did you see...

02:16:49.360 --> 02:16:50.360
Here I go.

02:16:50.360 --> 02:16:51.360
Opening Pandora's box.

02:16:51.360 --> 02:16:52.360
Woo!

02:16:52.360 --> 02:16:53.360
There was some magazine.

02:16:53.360 --> 02:16:57.560
It was Men's Health that did this piece on New York Comic-Con, and they just basically

02:16:57.560 --> 02:17:01.200
sent a photographer there to take pictures of fat cosplayers to put it on their website

02:17:01.200 --> 02:17:02.200
and make fun of them.

02:17:02.200 --> 02:17:07.040
Like, you know, guys dressed as Captain America or something like that that have, like, the

02:17:07.040 --> 02:17:10.400
beer bellies and things like that, and I was just like...

02:17:10.400 --> 02:17:12.880
It's obviously Men's Health, so I don't know if they're just trying to make people feel

02:17:12.880 --> 02:17:16.560
bad about themselves, so they'll subscribe to the magazine to, I don't know, get health

02:17:16.560 --> 02:17:19.660
tips, but the whole thing just came off as hella fucking rude.

02:17:19.660 --> 02:17:23.960
And like, you know, obviously Twitter and the internet, rightfully so, is pissed and

02:17:23.960 --> 02:17:24.960
demanding an apology.

02:17:24.960 --> 02:17:26.080
I don't know if they ever got one.

02:17:26.080 --> 02:17:34.000
I didn't follow the story that much, but it's just, ugh, just so classless, like, but it's

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:37.800
just all reason not to get that magazine, I suppose, that they're just gonna be rude

02:17:37.800 --> 02:17:38.800
like that.

02:17:38.800 --> 02:17:44.240
Like, who even in a boardroom, I mean, office, or a story editor, thinks that's funny.

02:17:44.240 --> 02:17:49.000
Let's go to New York Comic-Con and take pictures of fat people, and we'll put them in the magazine.

02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:51.920
That's like what the bullies did in high school.

02:17:51.920 --> 02:17:55.400
Let's go pick on the fags and put them in the trash can, huh huh.

02:17:55.400 --> 02:17:58.580
It's just ridiculous.

02:17:58.580 --> 02:18:01.560
Shame on everybody involved with that.

02:18:01.560 --> 02:18:06.840
And to the people that have the guts to dress up like in tights when they may not have perfect

02:18:06.840 --> 02:18:09.320
bodies, I say props to you.

02:18:09.320 --> 02:18:12.680
Props to you for having the guts to get out there and do that, because those people that

02:18:12.680 --> 02:18:15.800
write for the magazines often won't even put their fucking pictures in the mag.

02:18:15.800 --> 02:18:18.160
Let's see a picture of the guy that wrote that article, see what he looks like.

02:18:18.160 --> 02:18:21.480
I bet he's not perfect.

02:18:21.480 --> 02:18:22.800
And then one last thing.

02:18:22.800 --> 02:18:29.480
We did get your email, DKPopman, and also a shout out for The Doctor 90125, but what

02:18:29.480 --> 02:18:32.720
you talked about is actually coming up in just a few minutes, but we got your email.

02:18:32.720 --> 02:18:33.720
Hello, DKPopman.

02:18:33.720 --> 02:18:35.560
Well, hello and thank you.

02:18:35.560 --> 02:18:41.520
We always don't have time to write, do every email either, and I think that's important

02:18:41.520 --> 02:18:42.520
to keep in mind.

02:18:42.520 --> 02:18:43.520
That's it for mailbag.

02:18:43.520 --> 02:18:44.520
But we do read them all.

02:18:44.520 --> 02:18:45.520
Thank you.

02:18:45.520 --> 02:18:50.320
I just posted that actually his show, Anime Jam Session, a friend of ours, actually wrote

02:18:50.320 --> 02:18:52.940
this whole counter article to it.

02:18:52.940 --> 02:18:54.240
I'm not going to reread the whole thing.

02:18:54.240 --> 02:18:55.720
He's posted it in chat.

02:18:55.720 --> 02:18:59.040
The whole thing is infuriating enough where I really don't want to spend any more time

02:18:59.040 --> 02:19:05.000
talking about it, but if you just want to see reasons why you should be mad, go read

02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:07.040
it.

02:19:07.040 --> 02:19:14.960
You don't have to be fat to support fat rights, because how does that old saying go?

02:19:14.960 --> 02:19:20.680
At first they didn't come for me, and I said nothing, and then they came for me and no

02:19:20.680 --> 02:19:21.680
one said anything.

02:19:21.680 --> 02:19:22.680
Something like that.

02:19:22.680 --> 02:19:24.800
Somebody in chat will remind me what that is.

02:19:24.800 --> 02:19:29.480
Alright, anyhow, let's move on with some more news.

02:19:29.480 --> 02:19:38.080
It's hard to believe that this damn thing is so popular, but Angry Birds.

02:19:38.080 --> 02:19:43.600
They're getting a film, and why?

02:19:43.600 --> 02:19:49.040
Did they really run out of that many ideas that they have to create a movie based on

02:19:49.040 --> 02:19:50.040
this game?

02:19:50.040 --> 02:19:53.640
It doesn't make any sense, but anyways, the game's been downloaded over 400 million times,

02:19:53.640 --> 02:19:59.680
so they probably think, hey, you know what, let me make some money off that movie.

02:19:59.680 --> 02:20:06.760
And of course, their revenue, Rovio was currently valued at 1.2 billion dollars, which is ridiculous.

02:20:06.760 --> 02:20:10.120
Ridiculous, I say.

02:20:10.120 --> 02:20:17.120
And to kind of go along with that, Ubisoft, they have a wonderful franchise called Assassin's

02:20:17.120 --> 02:20:22.280
Creed, and Sony has apparently bought the rights to make a movie based on it, and this

02:20:22.280 --> 02:20:30.480
is coming from also the fact that Sony has just recently started registering a bunch

02:20:30.480 --> 02:20:38.120
of websites for an Assassin's Creed movie, so that's a good indicator.

02:20:38.120 --> 02:20:39.680
Assassin's Creed might make a pretty good movie.

02:20:39.680 --> 02:20:42.760
I think it could, because it actually has a pretty decent storyline to go along with

02:20:42.760 --> 02:20:44.640
it, so I can see that.

02:20:44.640 --> 02:20:47.080
I see it more so than Angry Birds, that's for sure.

02:20:47.080 --> 02:20:49.960
Angry Birds has no plot, other than, you know, it's just-

02:20:49.960 --> 02:20:51.200
They're mad at pigs.

02:20:51.200 --> 02:20:57.400
There's pigs, and they did something that angered the birds, and so you launch, I mean,

02:20:57.400 --> 02:21:00.680
I don't want to watch a movie where it's just birds flinging themselves at walls all

02:21:00.680 --> 02:21:01.680
movie long.

02:21:01.680 --> 02:21:06.560
I remember growing up in the 80s when Saturday morning cartoons were a thing, and you had

02:21:06.560 --> 02:21:11.200
these really awful Saturday morning cartoons that were only on for a season that promoted

02:21:11.200 --> 02:21:14.480
the toys, and the toys were there to promote the cartoon.

02:21:14.480 --> 02:21:18.400
Why not just have an Angry Birds cartoon, right?

02:21:18.400 --> 02:21:19.840
I mean-

02:21:19.840 --> 02:21:21.720
Makes sense.

02:21:21.720 --> 02:21:28.000
But again, little kids don't have $400 smartphones to play the damn game on, but yeah, it's like,

02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:29.000
why can't you just-

02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:31.360
But you can play the game on almost everything now.

02:21:31.360 --> 02:21:35.080
Well yeah, it's on Google Plus, and the port on Google Plus is actually pretty good, but

02:21:35.080 --> 02:21:38.680
it's like, I just remember, why can't you just make a cartoon series to sell some plastic

02:21:38.680 --> 02:21:40.240
shit and be done with it?

02:21:40.240 --> 02:21:43.240
I don't know why it needs a movie.

02:21:43.240 --> 02:21:44.240
That's all.

02:21:44.240 --> 02:21:50.000
Well, hearing about Angry Birds movies make me angry, and when we get angry, we rage,

02:21:50.000 --> 02:22:06.320
and it's the F-You's of the Week.

02:22:06.320 --> 02:22:20.080
Sure, I guess, um, F-You to waking up with headaches, which is weird, because it's like

02:22:20.080 --> 02:22:21.080
I was asleep, I should feel awesome if I have a headache.

02:22:21.080 --> 02:22:24.080
It got better, though, after once I got to brunch and ate, so just headaches are annoying.

02:22:24.080 --> 02:22:25.640
They make me sad.

02:22:25.640 --> 02:22:26.640
Headaches suck.

02:22:26.640 --> 02:22:27.640
I agree.

02:22:27.640 --> 02:22:28.640
Yeah.

02:22:28.640 --> 02:22:29.640
Loki!

02:22:29.640 --> 02:22:33.440
F-You to waiting.

02:22:33.440 --> 02:22:34.440
Wait longer.

02:22:34.440 --> 02:22:35.440
No!

02:22:35.440 --> 02:22:40.160
He wants to get home right now and go hunting for some stuff.

02:22:40.160 --> 02:22:45.560
Alright, uh, my F-You of the Week goes to the fact that, um, well look, here's the deal.

02:22:45.560 --> 02:22:47.760
I'm never gonna pay to go to BlizzCon.

02:22:47.760 --> 02:22:52.640
Like, let's be real, I'm not gonna pay to go play a couple of demos.

02:22:52.640 --> 02:22:53.640
Like, what do they want?

02:22:53.640 --> 02:22:58.120
About 150 bucks and sit on panels that I can read live blogs on the internet for free.

02:22:58.120 --> 02:23:02.360
However, F-You to the fact that I wasn't smart enough to take the time off anyway to drive

02:23:02.360 --> 02:23:08.400
down to Anaheim and go to DizCon, which was today, and, uh, just go to the parties.

02:23:08.400 --> 02:23:09.400
Like, seriously.

02:23:09.400 --> 02:23:10.960
Like, slices pop, am I right?

02:23:10.960 --> 02:23:15.000
We should've just gone to Disneyland Friday, Saturday, and then went to the BlizzCon parties

02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:16.000
at night, right?

02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:17.000
Yeah.

02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:18.000
Totally.

02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:19.000
We're so stupid!

02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:24.680
Oops, I'm so mad that the frickin' outro's playing now.

02:23:24.680 --> 02:23:27.760
Alright.

02:23:27.760 --> 02:23:31.240
Let's move on with some more gaming news and then of course Twitter topics and the Skype

02:23:31.240 --> 02:23:33.200
line coming very soon.

02:23:33.200 --> 02:23:36.600
Uh, 3D Classics is this thing on the 3DS.

02:23:36.600 --> 02:23:40.320
You know, they redid Excitebike and, like, Urban Champion for some weird reason and there's

02:23:40.320 --> 02:23:42.440
been some other things in there as well, like Twinbee.

02:23:42.440 --> 02:23:45.920
Uh, apparently the next game that will be out for 3D Classics, this is kind of a big

02:23:45.920 --> 02:23:46.920
one.

02:23:46.920 --> 02:23:47.920
Kid Icarus.

02:23:47.920 --> 02:23:49.760
The old school classic, that's right.

02:23:49.760 --> 02:23:52.560
This one is being, uh, done in 3D.

02:23:52.560 --> 02:23:55.640
Now of course that just means, you know, some of the sprites will be on different layers

02:23:55.640 --> 02:24:00.060
and eh, I don't think it'll be that big of a deal, but it's probably just being re-released

02:24:00.060 --> 02:24:04.320
to kind of raise awareness because of course they do have the Kid Icarus game coming out

02:24:04.320 --> 02:24:06.640
next year, so there you go.

02:24:06.640 --> 02:24:10.120
Nintendo has also pledged that they will be increasing the amount of 3D Classics that

02:24:10.120 --> 02:24:11.160
we see.

02:24:11.160 --> 02:24:12.860
Why not?

02:24:12.860 --> 02:24:16.960
It's super easy to program these, I'm sure, and it's a way to get you to buy virtual console

02:24:16.960 --> 02:24:18.320
games all over again.

02:24:18.320 --> 02:24:22.640
It's like, do I really need to be reminded how bloody hard that game was?

02:24:22.640 --> 02:24:24.320
But seriously, that game is so fucking good.

02:24:24.320 --> 02:24:28.280
Like I know some people say you remember it through rose-colored glasses and it's not

02:24:28.280 --> 02:24:31.200
that good, but like, the music is amazing.

02:24:31.200 --> 02:24:34.360
The dungeon levels are hard as hell and they're fun.

02:24:34.360 --> 02:24:37.040
Like, I'm just worried that- I had to use the codes out in Nintendo Power

02:24:37.040 --> 02:24:38.960
Magazine to get any progress in that game.

02:24:38.960 --> 02:24:41.920
Icarus fights Medusa Angels, or whatever it is.

02:24:41.920 --> 02:24:45.360
Medusa fights Icarus Angels, you get the reverse.

02:24:45.360 --> 02:24:48.240
My whole thing is that I'm really worried that if I were to purchase this, that the

02:24:48.240 --> 02:24:52.360
first time I get fucked over by an eggplant wizard, I'm gonna throw my 3DS against the

02:24:52.360 --> 02:24:55.200
wall like I used to throw my Nintendo controllers.

02:24:55.200 --> 02:24:58.840
Because those eggplant wizards are fucking bastards.

02:24:58.840 --> 02:25:06.120
And that music that plays when they get mad and they're like, you trolled me, yeah!

02:25:06.120 --> 02:25:07.120
Oh my god.

02:25:07.120 --> 02:25:09.280
Did you play a lot of Kid Icarus when you were younger?

02:25:09.280 --> 02:25:10.280
Oh yeah.

02:25:10.280 --> 02:25:11.280
Flash's Pop?

02:25:11.280 --> 02:25:12.280
Yeah.

02:25:12.280 --> 02:25:13.280
Oh god, it's one of my favorites.

02:25:13.280 --> 02:25:14.280
That's what I played.

02:25:14.280 --> 02:25:16.600
I completely missed the original Metroid train for the NES and I was playing Kid Icarus instead.

02:25:16.600 --> 02:25:17.640
Wait, here you go.

02:25:17.640 --> 02:25:19.800
Let's see if this music makes you think of the eggplant wizards.

02:25:19.800 --> 02:25:20.800
Oh god.

02:25:20.800 --> 02:25:21.800
You ready?

02:25:21.800 --> 02:25:25.360
I'm ready.

02:25:25.360 --> 02:25:33.000
That little sound they made, right?

02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:37.600
Yeah, when they saw you, they were very animated and upset and they squeaked at you.

02:25:37.600 --> 02:25:39.040
And the little babies flew out.

02:25:39.040 --> 02:25:41.920
And then you had to go see that nurse who kind of looked like a trapezoid.

02:25:41.920 --> 02:25:46.400
Like what was up with that?

02:25:46.400 --> 02:25:47.400
Nurse trapezoid.

02:25:47.400 --> 02:25:50.040
I need the eggplant curse removed.

02:25:50.040 --> 02:25:55.400
Alright, anyhow, Flash's Pop, what do you have for us?

02:25:55.400 --> 02:26:02.560
Soulcalibur V is getting a crossover franchise tie-in that makes sense and it's not Star

02:26:02.560 --> 02:26:05.560
Wars with Vader and Yoda and it's so good.

02:26:05.560 --> 02:26:08.360
I gotta say, Starkiller was awesome though in the game.

02:26:08.360 --> 02:26:10.840
Yeah, well, he's a nice looking gentleman.

02:26:10.840 --> 02:26:12.640
He's based off a real person, isn't he?

02:26:12.640 --> 02:26:15.880
Sam Witwer, the actor, yeah, is Starkiller.

02:26:15.880 --> 02:26:17.880
But anyway.

02:26:17.880 --> 02:26:21.600
How often are you thinking about this guy?

02:26:21.600 --> 02:26:23.200
Tapping my fingers on the desk.

02:26:23.200 --> 02:26:30.280
Enzo from Assassin's Creed, the last few Assassin's Creed games, is in Soulcalibur V and it looks

02:26:30.280 --> 02:26:35.440
super badass and he fits in stylistically with everyone.

02:26:35.440 --> 02:26:39.160
It was one of those things when they announced that, I was like, oh, I didn't think of that.

02:26:39.160 --> 02:26:40.160
But it makes sense.

02:26:40.160 --> 02:26:45.600
It's better than Kratos in Mortal Kombat and even that was reasonable.

02:26:45.600 --> 02:26:50.920
So yeah, Enzo is in Soulcalibur V, it's confirmed, I believe there are screenshots.

02:26:50.920 --> 02:26:56.000
And there's another little promotional tidbit that they've released for us.

02:26:56.000 --> 02:27:04.480
There is a special pre-order bonus character named Dump here and he is very wacky and silly.

02:27:04.480 --> 02:27:12.920
He's kind of a vaudeville circus MC with a hat and sort of like a villainous, the curly

02:27:12.920 --> 02:27:19.040
mustache that ties the damsel in distress on the railroad tracks.

02:27:19.040 --> 02:27:23.920
And he's got striped pants and he's very nutty.

02:27:23.920 --> 02:27:27.720
And you should watch the gameplay trailer of him doing his moves and it's like, this

02:27:27.720 --> 02:27:29.520
guy is nuts.

02:27:29.520 --> 02:27:31.520
But you get to make your own characters again, right?

02:27:31.520 --> 02:27:32.520
I believe so.

02:27:32.520 --> 02:27:34.320
Because I remember, was it Soulcalibur III or IV?

02:27:34.320 --> 02:27:35.320
I think it was you, Loki.

02:27:35.320 --> 02:27:37.760
It must have been III because it must have been back when we were living together when

02:27:37.760 --> 02:27:41.760
Soulcalibur III came out and you made that character named Benedict that looked like

02:27:41.760 --> 02:27:42.760
the poet.

02:27:42.760 --> 02:27:43.760
Well, that wasn't you.

02:27:43.760 --> 02:27:44.760
I thought that was.

02:27:44.760 --> 02:27:45.760
Was that X-Defer?

02:27:45.760 --> 02:27:46.760
It must have been X-Defer then.

02:27:46.760 --> 02:27:47.760
Why did I think it was you, Loki?

02:27:47.760 --> 02:27:48.760
I get you and X-Defer confused.

02:27:48.760 --> 02:27:52.720
I don't know how that's even possible.

02:27:52.720 --> 02:27:54.080
Good times.

02:27:54.080 --> 02:28:00.760
And he kind of reminds me of a silly character from Street Fighter IV who I hate, the big

02:28:00.760 --> 02:28:05.260
giant large guy with Rufus Rufus with the balloon belly.

02:28:05.260 --> 02:28:06.260
He's the American character.

02:28:06.260 --> 02:28:08.320
Like this is just Capcom being silly.

02:28:08.320 --> 02:28:14.040
This guy to me is that but done in a way that isn't totally stupid.

02:28:14.040 --> 02:28:15.040
Rufus has fans though.

02:28:15.040 --> 02:28:18.920
Rufus is going to be in the Street Fighter X Tekken game.

02:28:18.920 --> 02:28:24.800
Well that makes sense, I think, but yeah, so Enzo, awesome, and this weird wacky circus

02:28:24.800 --> 02:28:28.120
vaudeville guy, Dampier, if you pre-order the game.

02:28:28.120 --> 02:28:32.080
And that, when is, I think I had a release date here for when that game was coming out.

02:28:32.080 --> 02:28:33.080
Next year.

02:28:33.080 --> 02:28:34.080
Yeah, next year.

02:28:34.080 --> 02:28:35.080
January 31st.

02:28:35.080 --> 02:28:36.080
Don't want to say.

02:28:36.080 --> 02:28:37.080
Near the beginning of the year.

02:28:37.080 --> 02:28:40.240
So Soul Calibur fans rejoice.

02:28:40.240 --> 02:28:41.720
We'll be buying that, just so you know.

02:28:41.720 --> 02:28:42.720
Yeah.

02:28:42.720 --> 02:28:43.720
I played the hell out of IV.

02:28:43.720 --> 02:28:46.520
Soul Calibur is like my favorite fighting game franchise, so that's going to be awesome.

02:28:46.520 --> 02:28:47.520
I can't wait.

02:28:47.520 --> 02:28:50.240
In fact, we should start playing Soul Calibur IV again in anticipation.

02:28:50.240 --> 02:28:51.720
I have it on 360.

02:28:51.720 --> 02:28:52.720
Good times.

02:28:52.720 --> 02:28:56.000
I never did buy Vader though.

02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:59.680
For modded consoles, they have a topless version available.

02:28:59.680 --> 02:29:00.680
Of course.

02:29:00.680 --> 02:29:01.680
Of course.

02:29:01.680 --> 02:29:02.680
Yeah, I have-

02:29:02.680 --> 02:29:04.160
Ivy's like two pixels away from being topless.

02:29:04.160 --> 02:29:07.920
I have Yoda and Vader on my 360 account, so.

02:29:07.920 --> 02:29:08.920
Nice.

02:29:08.920 --> 02:29:10.920
Through me, you have it.

02:29:10.920 --> 02:29:11.920
Woohoo.

02:29:11.920 --> 02:29:14.920
Alright, couple more stories for you guys, then we'll get to the Twitters.

02:29:14.920 --> 02:29:16.280
Loki.

02:29:16.280 --> 02:29:24.360
So there's a lot of high concept stuff that Microsoft's doing, especially since, you know,

02:29:24.360 --> 02:29:31.040
they just, you know, had the Sesame Street Once Upon a Monster game come out on Xbox

02:29:31.040 --> 02:29:37.560
360 for Kinect just last week, and so now they're kind of showing, you know, what they

02:29:37.560 --> 02:29:40.480
could possibly do for, you know, new things.

02:29:40.480 --> 02:29:46.560
So next year, they're talking already, there's going to be a game called Pixar's Rush, and

02:29:46.560 --> 02:29:52.720
what this will allow you to do is, you know, actually go into the games as, you know, some

02:29:52.720 --> 02:29:54.560
of your favorite Pixar characters.

02:29:54.560 --> 02:29:58.560
They're going to have, you know, five different worlds, including The Incredibles, Ratatouille,

02:29:58.560 --> 02:30:02.840
Up, Toy Story, and Cars.

02:30:02.840 --> 02:30:10.360
And then, of course, going with that, they're going to also do Kinect Sesame Street TV,

02:30:10.360 --> 02:30:12.920
which is kind of neat.

02:30:12.920 --> 02:30:17.480
What it is, is it's going to be something that you watch actual TV shows, or like, almost

02:30:17.480 --> 02:30:22.000
like episodes, and you can interact with them using Kinect.

02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:28.640
So like, they showed one that showed kind of an almost live-action feed of, you know,

02:30:28.640 --> 02:30:29.640
Grover, whatever, trying to...

02:30:29.640 --> 02:30:31.120
Can I choke Elmo?

02:30:31.120 --> 02:30:33.040
I don't know about that.

02:30:33.040 --> 02:30:37.160
Trying to, like, catch stuff that you throw at him and stuff.

02:30:37.160 --> 02:30:43.720
And then they also had another kind of, going along with this new Family Vision video that

02:30:43.720 --> 02:30:48.960
they put out, showing a Kinect National Geographic TV.

02:30:48.960 --> 02:30:54.680
And with that, you can know, they have, like, people going, okay, you know, who can spot,

02:30:54.680 --> 02:30:56.480
you know, whatever.

02:30:56.480 --> 02:31:00.500
So you're like, you know, kind of have like a punch card almost that you're, okay, I see

02:31:00.500 --> 02:31:01.500
a moose.

02:31:01.500 --> 02:31:04.720
And, you know, whoever shouts it out first, you know, gets a point and that kind of stuff.

02:31:04.720 --> 02:31:08.020
Or you can ask about more information on certain things.

02:31:08.020 --> 02:31:09.800
It's like interactive TV almost.

02:31:09.800 --> 02:31:11.280
That's kind of neat.

02:31:11.280 --> 02:31:12.280
If it works.

02:31:12.280 --> 02:31:14.020
See, now that's going to be something if...

02:31:14.020 --> 02:31:16.320
That makes the Kinect very useful, actually.

02:31:16.320 --> 02:31:22.920
That to me seems like something that would be more useful for, like, their TV service.

02:31:22.920 --> 02:31:26.320
Especially since I would hope that something like that would be kind of free, since PBS

02:31:26.320 --> 02:31:29.760
is free, for the most part.

02:31:29.760 --> 02:31:32.720
So that'd be kind of cool if they had, you know, Sesame Street and stuff.

02:31:32.720 --> 02:31:34.840
You could download episodes.

02:31:34.840 --> 02:31:37.200
Why can't they do this with adult shows?

02:31:37.200 --> 02:31:39.920
Like can I vote for American Idol through my Kinect?

02:31:39.920 --> 02:31:42.060
That'd be kind of cool.

02:31:42.060 --> 02:31:46.480
You know, or yell, fuck this guy, and it'll, like, be a negative vote or something.

02:31:46.480 --> 02:31:47.480
Maybe.

02:31:47.480 --> 02:31:51.920
Going to our chat room, the chat is a little bit behind because of the live delay.

02:31:51.920 --> 02:31:54.200
They're commenting on the Soul Calibur story a little bit here.

02:31:54.200 --> 02:31:58.640
Hitstun wanted to throw out there that Dom Pierre debuted in Soul Calibur IV PSP.

02:31:58.640 --> 02:32:02.320
I guess sometimes the Soul Calibur series kind of does these previews.

02:32:02.320 --> 02:32:06.360
Hitstun says, just like Amy's moveset debuted in Soul Calibur III Arcade Edition before

02:32:06.360 --> 02:32:08.100
showing up in Soul Calibur IV.

02:32:08.100 --> 02:32:10.680
So sometimes you get a little sneak peek.

02:32:10.680 --> 02:32:13.200
I did not, I didn't play the Soul Calibur PSP.

02:32:13.200 --> 02:32:14.200
I don't know, I don't know why.

02:32:14.200 --> 02:32:15.480
I just didn't think it would transfer very well.

02:32:15.480 --> 02:32:18.920
It's like an action RPG, I think, right, where it's fighting matches but also a story mode.

02:32:18.920 --> 02:32:21.680
I think it's a lot more fighting.

02:32:21.680 --> 02:32:24.200
And I believe, if I'm not mistaken, Kratos was on that.

02:32:24.200 --> 02:32:27.520
So yeah, funny enough, Kratos is in everything!

02:32:27.520 --> 02:32:32.160
All right, what'll he be in next, Angry Birds?

02:32:32.160 --> 02:32:37.840
All right, last but not least tonight before we get to the Skype line is a story about

02:32:37.840 --> 02:32:39.080
toilet gaming.

02:32:39.080 --> 02:32:43.000
Yes, we've heard about this before, but no seriously, it's like going on to the next

02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:44.120
level now.

02:32:44.120 --> 02:32:49.400
Sega Toys is making these toilets where you can actually game with pee.

02:32:49.400 --> 02:32:53.480
There's all sorts of mini games like erasing graffiti with a hose.

02:32:53.480 --> 02:32:55.640
You can guess what the hose is.

02:32:55.640 --> 02:32:58.540
You can use wind to blow under a woman's skirt.

02:32:58.540 --> 02:33:00.000
Somehow your pee is wind.

02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:01.840
I don't know.

02:33:01.840 --> 02:33:05.240
And do I even want to read this?

02:33:05.240 --> 02:33:09.040
A bukkake battle where you shoot milk from your nose.

02:33:09.040 --> 02:33:10.040
No!

02:33:10.040 --> 02:33:16.480
Yes, in fact, you can actually see some pictures here at mycom.co.jp.

02:33:16.480 --> 02:33:23.480
You can actually see pictures of the little urinals here with the little TV monitors in

02:33:23.480 --> 02:33:24.480
them.

02:33:24.480 --> 02:33:25.480
See, look at that.

02:33:25.480 --> 02:33:26.480
See, that creeps me out though.

02:33:26.480 --> 02:33:28.600
Doesn't that look like a little webcam at the top?

02:33:28.600 --> 02:33:33.240
Like who knows what images are being transmitted to Sega headquarters on that thing?

02:33:33.240 --> 02:33:35.040
Like you sick pervos.

02:33:35.040 --> 02:33:39.760
And for this screenshot here with the little angry cloud of wind that's trying to blow

02:33:39.760 --> 02:33:45.240
up the girl's dress so that we can see her underwear, I'm just thinking of some dude

02:33:45.240 --> 02:33:49.560
totally dunking his ass over this thing and letting him want to rip and then sharding.

02:33:49.560 --> 02:33:54.520
And it's like, dear Sega, your game made me shit my pants and I'm very upset that the

02:33:54.520 --> 02:33:57.640
little fart cloud panty game made me do this.

02:33:57.640 --> 02:33:58.640
Sorry.

02:33:58.640 --> 02:33:59.640
Got problems.

02:33:59.640 --> 02:34:04.720
Do you have to insert a quarter to make this work or is it just like, are we going back

02:34:04.720 --> 02:34:06.480
to pay toilets or what's the deal?

02:34:06.480 --> 02:34:07.840
Oh, you got to enter.

02:34:07.840 --> 02:34:11.840
Insert something stop.

02:34:11.840 --> 02:34:14.200
Just think of, you know, people drunk.

02:34:14.200 --> 02:34:15.320
They can't aim.

02:34:15.320 --> 02:34:16.360
You work in an arcade.

02:34:16.360 --> 02:34:18.160
You're like, I, I'm not cleaning this up.

02:34:18.160 --> 02:34:23.960
Hilarious thing to have at a bar, but let's, let's just, let's just all form a prayer circle

02:34:23.960 --> 02:34:28.560
right now and hope that this never shows up in the U S let's just bow our heads.

02:34:28.560 --> 02:34:33.260
All right, we're going to open up the Skype line.

02:34:33.260 --> 02:34:37.600
It's about time one eight seven seven game O L R or our username on Skype is orange lounge

02:34:37.600 --> 02:34:38.600
radio.

02:34:38.600 --> 02:34:41.080
We will take your calls about anything you want to talk about tonight, whether it be

02:34:41.080 --> 02:34:44.760
a story that we've talked about or something that maybe we didn't get to.

02:34:44.760 --> 02:34:47.640
Maybe you want to talk about how you've had yourself barricaded in your room all week

02:34:47.640 --> 02:34:48.640
playing Arkham city.

02:34:48.640 --> 02:34:50.900
I'd love to hear about it cause sadly none of us did that.

02:34:50.900 --> 02:34:53.040
So there you go.

02:34:53.040 --> 02:34:57.320
One eight seven seven game O L R or our username on Skype is orange lounge radio.

02:34:57.320 --> 02:35:00.960
It is a toll free number in the U S and Canada, but I can't speak for other countries.

02:35:00.960 --> 02:35:04.560
I would suggest if you're in another country, you get Skype for free orange lounge radio,

02:35:04.560 --> 02:35:07.160
all one word on Skype.

02:35:07.160 --> 02:35:12.120
Meanwhile while we wait for calls, we're going to go to the Twitters, uh, dark to see a tweets

02:35:12.120 --> 02:35:13.120
us.

02:35:13.120 --> 02:35:16.400
If the DDR freak thing doesn't wind up happening, we should totally organize a tournament of

02:35:16.400 --> 02:35:19.040
some sort for our 10th next year.

02:35:19.040 --> 02:35:20.640
That's kind of what I want to do anyway.

02:35:20.640 --> 02:35:25.560
In fact, I've, I've kind of put dark soccer in charge of putting the 10th thing together,

02:35:25.560 --> 02:35:32.120
um, because she knows people that do stuff at places that we want to be involved with.

02:35:32.120 --> 02:35:35.440
And I can't say much more than that, but we are trying to make the 10th a big deal, but

02:35:35.440 --> 02:35:40.400
I want to warn you guys, it may not be on the exact anniversary of the show, but we're

02:35:40.400 --> 02:35:42.020
trying to get close.

02:35:42.020 --> 02:35:46.280
So for those that are trying to be prepared, shut up.

02:35:46.280 --> 02:35:48.200
We can celebrate a little early if we want.

02:35:48.200 --> 02:35:51.240
In the meantime, we're going to go to the calls and Skypline, all that stuff higher

02:35:51.240 --> 02:35:52.240
on orange launch radio.

02:35:52.240 --> 02:35:53.240
Who's this?

02:35:53.240 --> 02:35:54.240
It's death wishings.

02:35:54.240 --> 02:35:55.480
Hey, haven't heard from you in a while.

02:35:55.480 --> 02:35:56.480
What's up?

02:35:56.480 --> 02:35:57.480
Nothing much.

02:35:57.480 --> 02:36:00.760
I'm surprised you didn't make it to Dave gruel con.

02:36:00.760 --> 02:36:04.320
I'm not going to pay 130 bucks to play demos of betas.

02:36:04.320 --> 02:36:06.040
I'm going to sell my soul to blizzard.

02:36:06.040 --> 02:36:08.320
You can see all those cool pandas.

02:36:08.320 --> 02:36:12.280
I can see all that cool shit on DirecTV and I've got this thing called the internet is

02:36:12.280 --> 02:36:15.960
panda continent, panda class, panda games, and Pokemon.

02:36:15.960 --> 02:36:24.680
So actually I want to talk to Loki about, uh, grant the photo mods.

02:36:24.680 --> 02:36:25.680
All right.

02:36:25.680 --> 02:36:26.680
That'll cost a dollar.

02:36:26.680 --> 02:36:27.680
Interesting.

02:36:27.680 --> 02:36:28.680
Mod is, have you heard?

02:36:28.680 --> 02:36:29.680
Look, have you heard of that ice?

02:36:29.680 --> 02:36:32.240
It's, I think it's like icy enhancer.

02:36:32.240 --> 02:36:33.240
Yeah.

02:36:33.240 --> 02:36:36.400
And it's, uh, the, uh, Ian, it's EMB stuff.

02:36:36.400 --> 02:36:39.880
It like, it does like a crazy texture, like mods and all that.

02:36:39.880 --> 02:36:43.000
It makes the game look just like ungodly beautiful.

02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:44.000
Yeah.

02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:47.800
A lot of, a lot of the EMB stuff, uh, looks pretty good.

02:36:47.800 --> 02:36:48.960
And I mean, do you use it?

02:36:48.960 --> 02:36:49.960
Like, can you run it?

02:36:49.960 --> 02:36:53.780
Cause my, my, me, my friend, we're trying to, we're worried that he wants to install it,

02:36:53.780 --> 02:36:56.040
but he's afraid that he can't run it.

02:36:56.040 --> 02:36:57.840
And I'm, cause he doesn't have a core i7.

02:36:57.840 --> 02:37:02.000
He, I think he only has like a i3.

02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:08.480
I haven't tried to run it and really don't feel like trying to run it either because

02:37:08.480 --> 02:37:10.680
you can break your toaster.

02:37:10.680 --> 02:37:15.820
Well, because you know, on my laptop, um, you know, it runs all right.

02:37:15.820 --> 02:37:21.640
I have everything turned up pretty high, but, um, I just don't really care for it to look

02:37:21.640 --> 02:37:26.720
any better than it already does cause really I just use this laptop for working on map

02:37:26.720 --> 02:37:28.080
mods and stuff like that.

02:37:28.080 --> 02:37:34.400
And, you know, just trying to put stuff together that way.

02:37:34.400 --> 02:37:38.520
You know, I, I was working on something today and the frame rate's crawling because I have

02:37:38.520 --> 02:37:42.600
so many objects spawning, I have to work on, you know, trimming stuff down.

02:37:42.600 --> 02:37:46.960
So yeah, I don't really need any more graphical enhancements added onto it.

02:37:46.960 --> 02:37:47.960
Hmm.

02:37:47.960 --> 02:37:49.480
Oh, anyways, back to Sky.

02:37:49.480 --> 02:37:53.360
So what, honestly, since you played WoW, I believe you played a lot of WoW, right?

02:37:53.360 --> 02:37:55.760
I have played a lot of WoW, yes.

02:37:55.760 --> 02:37:58.800
What is, honestly, what is your whole opinion on this expansion?

02:37:58.800 --> 02:38:02.260
Um, I, I'm whatever about the panda thing.

02:38:02.260 --> 02:38:07.400
I think it's a little silly that they're bi-factional, but you know, I, I think it'll be good in

02:38:07.400 --> 02:38:08.400
the long run.

02:38:08.400 --> 02:38:09.600
I love the art style.

02:38:09.600 --> 02:38:14.080
Like even though I'm meh on the pandas, I would have been like 100% totally okay with

02:38:14.080 --> 02:38:16.720
this at the panda, panda, and been NPCs.

02:38:16.720 --> 02:38:18.560
Like I kind of think they should have stayed.

02:38:18.560 --> 02:38:20.960
I would have rather seen the Tuskar be playable.

02:38:20.960 --> 02:38:28.440
Well, of course I just want a Tuskar named Diabetus, but the Tuskar or the Tonka, what

02:38:28.440 --> 02:38:30.720
are those, what are the Torrin like people called?

02:38:30.720 --> 02:38:31.720
The Bison.

02:38:31.720 --> 02:38:32.720
They're Tonka.

02:38:32.720 --> 02:38:33.720
Yeah.

02:38:33.720 --> 02:38:34.720
They could have been a great playable class.

02:38:34.720 --> 02:38:37.400
The Naga, everybody thinks is inevitable at some point.

02:38:37.400 --> 02:38:39.800
It just seems like there's a lot of other stuff they could have chose from, but fine.

02:38:39.800 --> 02:38:40.800
They went cute.

02:38:40.800 --> 02:38:45.400
I mean, I understand, I guess pandas allegedly are a part of a lore, my friend said, but

02:38:45.400 --> 02:38:50.840
they're always joke lore, but it's like, honestly, I mean, every update I've seen,

02:38:50.840 --> 02:38:52.640
you know, and wow, like that, it's so funny.

02:38:52.640 --> 02:38:56.840
The ones that have added like big segments were, this is part of the segment and then

02:38:56.840 --> 02:38:57.840
there's all this shit to do.

02:38:57.840 --> 02:39:01.520
And then it was like cataclysm, oh, it changes map, but there's all this shit to do.

02:39:01.520 --> 02:39:05.640
And then this one's just like fucking pandas everywhere.

02:39:05.640 --> 02:39:06.640
Look at us.

02:39:06.640 --> 02:39:07.640
We're so cool.

02:39:07.640 --> 02:39:08.640
Weaboo now.

02:39:08.640 --> 02:39:10.200
Well, look, here's the thing though.

02:39:10.200 --> 02:39:13.520
At the end of the day, like I probably will not be rolling a panda monk.

02:39:13.520 --> 02:39:16.640
I will have to roll a gnome monk, cause that's going to be awesome.

02:39:16.640 --> 02:39:17.640
Cause gnomes are hilarious.

02:39:17.640 --> 02:39:18.640
Oh, you can be a gnome monk?

02:39:18.640 --> 02:39:20.080
I thought it was only pandas could be monks.

02:39:20.080 --> 02:39:24.600
No, anybody can be not monks, except funny enough, Worgen and Goblin, who were the additions

02:39:24.600 --> 02:39:26.320
in the last expansion.

02:39:26.320 --> 02:39:29.920
Every other race in the game can be, I'm just waiting to see a bunch of pandas with a variation

02:39:29.920 --> 02:39:31.040
of the name, Jack Black.

02:39:31.040 --> 02:39:32.040
Yeah, I know.

02:39:32.040 --> 02:39:33.040
Right.

02:39:33.040 --> 02:39:34.040
Reserve the names.

02:39:34.040 --> 02:39:37.960
Now, Slace's Pop told a funny joke on Horde House about, what was it you said about female

02:39:37.960 --> 02:39:38.960
pandarins?

02:39:38.960 --> 02:39:44.080
Their slash dance emote is they're just going to sit in a chair and move their hand around

02:39:44.080 --> 02:39:46.640
like Adele and rolling in the deep.

02:39:46.640 --> 02:39:47.720
They're just going to sit in a chair.

02:39:47.720 --> 02:39:51.640
I was trying to get, I was trying to get a panda named Adele, but the name was already

02:39:51.640 --> 02:39:52.640
taken.

02:39:52.640 --> 02:39:53.640
Like somebody beat us to it.

02:39:53.640 --> 02:39:56.520
So, uh, but, uh, here's the thing, Death Wishing.

02:39:56.520 --> 02:40:00.000
And I kind of said this at the top of the show, but I'm more excited about the fact

02:40:00.000 --> 02:40:05.040
that they're giving players at level 90, so much more to do than just dungeon rating and

02:40:05.040 --> 02:40:07.440
PVP, which is already a lot as it is, but now,

02:40:07.440 --> 02:40:09.040
They're giving us Pokemon.

02:40:09.040 --> 02:40:10.040
Pokemon.

02:40:10.040 --> 02:40:11.040
Believe it or not.

02:40:11.040 --> 02:40:12.040
It's a thing.

02:40:12.040 --> 02:40:13.040
People will be into it.

02:40:13.040 --> 02:40:14.040
Uh, challenge dungeons.

02:40:14.040 --> 02:40:15.040
Sounds like I'm really excited.

02:40:15.040 --> 02:40:18.640
I think they're just scared because of the older public.

02:40:18.640 --> 02:40:19.640
Of course they are.

02:40:19.640 --> 02:40:20.640
Of course they are.

02:40:20.640 --> 02:40:21.640
They're just business.

02:40:21.640 --> 02:40:23.640
I stopped playing Eve Online just because of that.

02:40:23.640 --> 02:40:25.200
I'm going to be playing that.

02:40:25.200 --> 02:40:29.000
Here's the thing, you know, and I have no doubt that the game will be good.

02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:31.120
However, we have gone through this.

02:40:31.120 --> 02:40:32.480
How many times?

02:40:32.480 --> 02:40:34.560
Age of Conan was going to be the killer.

02:40:34.560 --> 02:40:36.640
Then EverQuest II and then War Hammer.

02:40:36.640 --> 02:40:39.240
You don't understand man, it's Star Wars.

02:40:39.240 --> 02:40:40.240
I know.

02:40:40.240 --> 02:40:41.240
I know.

02:40:41.240 --> 02:40:44.160
It's going to be all the people, I'm telling you, all the people from Star Wars Galaxies

02:40:44.160 --> 02:40:48.440
will play it because of the remorse of Star Wars Galaxies shutting down.

02:40:48.440 --> 02:40:51.600
They may not like it, but they'll just cry themselves while playing it.

02:40:51.600 --> 02:40:55.120
I miss you.

02:40:55.120 --> 02:40:56.120
That's all I can say.

02:40:56.120 --> 02:41:00.200
I, I, I, obviously Blizzard is going to lose some people to Star Wars.

02:41:00.200 --> 02:41:03.440
That's why they've come up with this whole annual pass thing to lock you in anyway.

02:41:03.440 --> 02:41:05.000
I mean that's no, no.

02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:09.440
I mean, I heard that buying a year pass now you can get Diablo 3 for free, that's from

02:41:09.440 --> 02:41:11.480
what I heard.

02:41:11.480 --> 02:41:16.560
And that's just kind of solidifying that they, Activision Blizzard has too much money.

02:41:16.560 --> 02:41:18.880
Well we'll give you the game that we know we're going to make shitloads of money on

02:41:18.880 --> 02:41:19.880
for free.

02:41:19.880 --> 02:41:20.880
Not really.

02:41:20.880 --> 02:41:21.880
Because we have too much money.

02:41:21.880 --> 02:41:25.200
I know, they're going to make money on Diablo anyway, and like I said earlier, if you're

02:41:25.200 --> 02:41:29.800
contracted for a year of wow, you pretty much are guaranteed to get Mists of Pandaria, which

02:41:29.800 --> 02:41:32.800
they're not giving you for free, so.

02:41:32.800 --> 02:41:33.800
Mists of Pandaria.

02:41:33.800 --> 02:41:34.800
Yep.

02:41:34.800 --> 02:41:40.760
Alright, any other BlizzCon or what have you thoughts before we let you go, buddy?

02:41:40.760 --> 02:41:43.360
Did anything cool happen with the whole Foo Fighters thing?

02:41:43.360 --> 02:41:45.040
Any reports on that, or was it just Foo Fighters?

02:41:45.040 --> 02:41:47.720
Dave Roll played the guitar in the audience, that's what I heard.

02:41:47.720 --> 02:41:49.120
So like, you might have got to touch him.

02:41:49.120 --> 02:41:50.760
Oh okay, so I already seen that live.

02:41:50.760 --> 02:41:51.760
Oh okay, cool.

02:41:51.760 --> 02:41:52.760
Alright, cool story bro.

02:41:52.760 --> 02:41:53.760
Alright.

02:41:53.760 --> 02:41:54.760
Alright.

02:41:54.760 --> 02:41:55.760
Take care, buddy.

02:41:55.760 --> 02:41:56.760
Later.

02:41:56.760 --> 02:41:57.760
Bye.

02:41:57.760 --> 02:42:03.400
I still want the WoW expansion, Mists of Panera Bread, so I can play a, get a turkey feta

02:42:03.400 --> 02:42:05.360
panini with side salad.

02:42:05.360 --> 02:42:07.920
Kaijuto in chat says, back off Adele, she's hot.

02:42:07.920 --> 02:42:12.160
Hey, I never said she wasn't hot, like you know, everybody's into whatever, but I'm just,

02:42:12.160 --> 02:42:16.480
I'm sorry, it's just, the joke was too good, you had to, I had to be there.

02:42:16.480 --> 02:42:19.000
Alright, let's see, moving on with some more tweets.

02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:22.600
MNZeba tweets us saying, Loki, is this what you do when you play Grand Theft Auto?

02:42:22.600 --> 02:42:26.240
Usually I don't click on YouTubes that I don't know what they are, but I'm going to take

02:42:26.240 --> 02:42:27.240
a chance on this one.

02:42:27.240 --> 02:42:28.240
Let's see.

02:42:28.240 --> 02:42:31.240
No, but I feel like that's pretty funny.

02:42:31.240 --> 02:42:33.960
It's like, what, throwing cars at people?

02:42:33.960 --> 02:42:39.800
No, it's not throwing cars, the cars just never exist, so they fly around.

02:42:39.800 --> 02:42:40.800
That's funny.

02:42:40.800 --> 02:42:44.040
It looks like Nightmeto's just throwing cars around.

02:42:44.040 --> 02:42:51.080
It is very hard to play that, I once contemplated doing that as part of the mod, but I was quickly

02:42:51.080 --> 02:42:53.800
vetoed on that, because, so like, uh, yeah.

02:42:53.800 --> 02:42:57.920
So you're trying to do the campaign stuff, or is this for Deathmatch, or are you trying

02:42:57.920 --> 02:42:58.920
to run around?

02:42:58.920 --> 02:43:01.400
I gotta take this call, it's a very appropriate time.

02:43:01.400 --> 02:43:03.400
Hi, you're on Warner Brothers Radio, who's this?

02:43:03.400 --> 02:43:04.400
Hi, this is Zeba.

02:43:04.400 --> 02:43:08.640
Zeba, we're watching this video, I am cracking the hell up at this Grand Theft Auto stuff,

02:43:08.640 --> 02:43:09.640
this is great.

02:43:09.640 --> 02:43:14.200
Yeah, I found that on my Twitter, I was like, oh god, I just thought of Loki just right

02:43:14.200 --> 02:43:15.200
when I watched it.

02:43:15.200 --> 02:43:18.840
And I love that they used the Benny Hill theme, A+, thumbs up.

02:43:18.840 --> 02:43:19.840
Thanks.

02:43:19.840 --> 02:43:22.120
So what's on your mind tonight, Zeba?

02:43:22.120 --> 02:43:24.360
I just want to let you know, you jinxed my iPhone.

02:43:24.360 --> 02:43:27.680
Oh shit, what did I do?

02:43:27.680 --> 02:43:33.640
A couple days later, that you announced that your iPhone's power button went, um, mine

02:43:33.640 --> 02:43:34.640
went.

02:43:34.640 --> 02:43:38.120
Oh no, I'm sorry, is it the sleep button, or is it the...

02:43:38.120 --> 02:43:41.880
Yes, the sleep button, the sleep power button, whatever you want to call it, on the top.

02:43:41.880 --> 02:43:48.400
They're faulty, I want a refund, I'm suing Apple, I'm suing Steve Jobs, wait, can't do

02:43:48.400 --> 02:43:52.200
that, I'm suing Tim Cook, I'm suing everybody.

02:43:52.200 --> 02:43:59.040
Well, thank god that my iPhone is not a year old yet, so I still had warranty, so they

02:43:59.040 --> 02:44:01.120
were able to give me a whole new phone.

02:44:01.120 --> 02:44:02.120
Nice!

02:44:02.120 --> 02:44:03.120
You know what's funny?

02:44:03.120 --> 02:44:07.120
My very first iPhone 4, the little ringer button, the little thing on the side next

02:44:07.120 --> 02:44:11.520
to the volume that turns the ringer on and off, that was broken.

02:44:11.520 --> 02:44:15.840
But that was like day one, a break, so they gave me a new phone for free, but it was still,

02:44:15.840 --> 02:44:18.280
I had to re-sync everything, blah blah blah blah.

02:44:18.280 --> 02:44:21.940
I'm gonna get a new phone, but probably in January, and I've got to decide between now

02:44:21.940 --> 02:44:26.320
and then if I'm just gonna say, you know what, forget the iPhone, I'm done with it, and go

02:44:26.320 --> 02:44:31.600
to the iPad, or if I'm gonna get suckered in and buy the iPhone 4S anyway, of which

02:44:31.600 --> 02:44:36.440
everybody's just raving about Siri, oh, I love Siri, I love Siri, so.

02:44:36.440 --> 02:44:40.360
How are you liking your iPhone, though, otherwise, do you do any gaming on it?

02:44:40.360 --> 02:44:49.440
I have some games, I have like Secret of Mana, and Final Fantasy Tactics, and Katamari Damacy,

02:44:49.440 --> 02:44:51.480
and you know, Infinity Blade.

02:44:51.480 --> 02:44:54.360
Do you think, is it just me, or do a lot of them play like poop?

02:44:54.360 --> 02:44:58.760
Yeah, especially Secret of Mana is really hard to move around.

02:44:58.760 --> 02:44:59.760
Yeah, it's unfortunate.

02:44:59.760 --> 02:45:03.600
They made it a little better, but it still is pretty hard.

02:45:03.600 --> 02:45:09.920
I will say, though, the Final Fantasy 3 remake, it's probably still like 15 bucks, which is

02:45:09.920 --> 02:45:16.080
like 15 times as much, what most games cost, but it's actually done really well, and it's

02:45:16.080 --> 02:45:21.940
easy to control, so I gotta say, the Final Fantasy 3 remake from the DS is really good

02:45:21.940 --> 02:45:28.320
on iPhone, or iPad, whatever it is, you're gonna game on out there in the audience, so.

02:45:28.320 --> 02:45:32.960
I did have the DS version, so I'm not really into, you know, getting it on my phone.

02:45:32.960 --> 02:45:35.160
Yeah, you don't need to buy the same thing twice, that's true.

02:45:35.160 --> 02:45:36.160
No.

02:45:36.160 --> 02:45:38.920
So what else have you been playing, any console or PC games?

02:45:38.920 --> 02:45:45.880
I did get a new DS game, I can't really pronounce the name, it's like Sola do Robo, the Red

02:45:45.880 --> 02:45:46.880
Hunter.

02:45:46.880 --> 02:45:47.880
Okay.

02:45:47.880 --> 02:45:50.000
What's this game about?

02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:54.360
All the furries are getting it, but that's not why I got it.

02:45:54.360 --> 02:45:59.200
But it's, I just kind of just started playing it, so I really don't know too much about

02:45:59.200 --> 02:46:06.120
the story, but you are this fox, and you're just trying to save the world, but I really

02:46:06.120 --> 02:46:10.160
don't know too much about the story, like I said, I have to keep going at it, but I

02:46:10.160 --> 02:46:11.160
like it so far.

02:46:11.160 --> 02:46:12.160
Nice.

02:46:12.160 --> 02:46:15.200
And why are the furries into it?

02:46:15.200 --> 02:46:21.440
Because it's all, you know, anthropomorphic characters in it.

02:46:21.440 --> 02:46:22.440
That sounds like fun.

02:46:22.440 --> 02:46:26.320
Slice just popped, did I see your eyes just perk up a little bit?

02:46:26.320 --> 02:46:27.320
Yes.

02:46:27.320 --> 02:46:30.600
Oh god, please don't go there.

02:46:30.600 --> 02:46:31.600
Alright.

02:46:31.600 --> 02:46:36.220
Ziba, I hope you enjoy the game, and enjoy your phone now that it works again, and I'm

02:46:36.220 --> 02:46:37.920
sorry to curse you, but I'm really happy.

02:46:37.920 --> 02:46:39.240
I'm really just joking.

02:46:39.240 --> 02:46:43.080
I know, I know, but I'm glad you at least got a replacement for free.

02:46:43.080 --> 02:46:45.960
To be fair, I still need to take mine to the store and see if there's anything they can

02:46:45.960 --> 02:46:49.360
do with it, but I just, I don't have my hopes up because I didn't buy AppleCare, so.

02:46:49.360 --> 02:46:52.840
Alright, well Ziba, I'm going to let you go, okay?

02:46:52.840 --> 02:46:53.840
Okay, thank you.

02:46:53.840 --> 02:46:55.800
Alright, take care, thanks for calling in, and thanks again for the video.

02:46:55.800 --> 02:46:56.800
No problem.

02:46:56.800 --> 02:46:57.800
Later.

02:46:57.800 --> 02:47:01.400
1877 Game OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:47:01.400 --> 02:47:05.640
Going to some other tweets, Zither77 tweets us saying, you guys may want to see this,

02:47:05.640 --> 02:47:09.880
it's probably going to be the pinball video game to end all pinball video games, and gives

02:47:09.880 --> 02:47:16.440
this cheap plug for pinball arcade, which I guess is for the phones and so forth.

02:47:16.440 --> 02:47:19.120
Is this like something you're working on or something?

02:47:19.120 --> 02:47:20.120
I don't know.

02:47:20.120 --> 02:47:24.920
Oh shit, it has Arabian Nights, I'm there.

02:47:24.920 --> 02:47:26.920
Fucking love the Arabian Nights table.

02:47:26.920 --> 02:47:28.760
Isn't this just...

02:47:28.760 --> 02:47:35.800
Oh, it looks like they have an arrangement with various pinball table folks.

02:47:35.800 --> 02:47:39.040
There's Black Hole, because it's got Ballystern.

02:47:39.040 --> 02:47:44.440
Oh my god, Theater of Magic, I'm so in, this is like the best table ever.

02:47:44.440 --> 02:47:47.440
You remember this, did you ever play that?

02:47:47.440 --> 02:47:48.440
Yeah.

02:47:48.440 --> 02:47:54.600
Alright, I don't know if you work for the developer or what, but good job, I'm sold.

02:47:54.600 --> 02:47:59.440
Let's see, Ericcarr18 on Twitter tweets us saying, hey guys, what if someone made a Red

02:47:59.440 --> 02:48:01.960
Dead Redemption-esque game for the Kinect?

02:48:01.960 --> 02:48:04.420
I think that might be cool.

02:48:04.420 --> 02:48:06.200
Would you play Red Dead Redemption on Kinect?

02:48:06.200 --> 02:48:07.200
No.

02:48:07.200 --> 02:48:10.960
I think Red Dead Redemption on Kinect would not be as good as just Red Dead Redemption.

02:48:10.960 --> 02:48:16.200
Like, I don't know, I don't think people should feel forced to pigeonhole an existing game

02:48:16.200 --> 02:48:17.200
into the Kinect.

02:48:17.200 --> 02:48:19.280
Like, that Fable game really has me worried.

02:48:19.280 --> 02:48:23.320
What are you talking about, it has you worried?

02:48:23.320 --> 02:48:26.480
It's gonna suck, like all the other ones have sucked.

02:48:26.480 --> 02:48:27.600
I know.

02:48:27.600 --> 02:48:30.520
Because Peter Molyneux is full of crap.

02:48:30.520 --> 02:48:31.960
But he's new and cutting edge.

02:48:31.960 --> 02:48:34.160
No, he's not new and cutting edge, he's stupid.

02:48:34.160 --> 02:48:35.160
Hey, ah!

02:48:35.160 --> 02:48:36.160
What's up in here?

02:48:36.160 --> 02:48:37.160
Hey, Zaku.

02:48:37.160 --> 02:48:38.160
Welcome to the show.

02:48:38.160 --> 02:48:39.160
What's on your mind, buddy?

02:48:39.160 --> 02:48:44.760
Oh, nothing much, just trying to like absorb all the gaming news that's, you know, or lack

02:48:44.760 --> 02:48:45.760
thereof maybe.

02:48:45.760 --> 02:48:47.560
It was just happening this weekend.

02:48:47.560 --> 02:48:50.040
Well, if you're not into Blizzard, it has been kind of a dry week.

02:48:50.040 --> 02:48:57.400
You know, Blizzcon happened, and you know, aside from like, Starcraft, the new expansion

02:48:57.400 --> 02:49:03.680
pack, not really like phased in, but I am hyped for Battlefield 3, which is like this

02:49:03.680 --> 02:49:06.400
Tuesday, even though I don't have my new computer ready.

02:49:06.400 --> 02:49:08.440
Oh, I didn't realize it was that soon.

02:49:08.440 --> 02:49:09.440
It's this Tuesday, huh?

02:49:09.440 --> 02:49:10.440
Yeah.

02:49:10.440 --> 02:49:11.440
Now, you've been talking, you've talked.

02:49:11.440 --> 02:49:14.520
I just, like, because of work and everything, I didn't have the time to like start speccing

02:49:14.520 --> 02:49:17.800
on a new computer, so I'm gonna have to play catch up.

02:49:17.800 --> 02:49:21.840
You've called in to talk about this game before, are you excited about this?

02:49:21.840 --> 02:49:22.840
Are you buying it?

02:49:22.840 --> 02:49:28.200
Yes, I mean, I've seen footage of the beta so far, and it's like, it's a lot better than,

02:49:28.200 --> 02:49:31.520
it's pretty much a lot better than Bad Company 2 at the very least.

02:49:31.520 --> 02:49:38.440
More importantly, it does step it up as being the most realistic first person shooter this

02:49:38.440 --> 02:49:39.440
year.

02:49:39.440 --> 02:49:41.560
Did you decide to go PC, Xbox?

02:49:41.560 --> 02:49:42.560
PC.

02:49:42.560 --> 02:49:43.560
Okay.

02:49:43.560 --> 02:49:47.000
Why do you think I just said that I'm trying to specc out a new PC for you?

02:49:47.000 --> 02:49:48.000
Oh, derp.

02:49:48.000 --> 02:49:49.000
Okay.

02:49:49.000 --> 02:49:50.000
So I don't listen very well, my bad.

02:49:50.000 --> 02:49:55.920
But it's just like, I mean, I've already made my decision between that and Modern Warfare

02:49:55.920 --> 02:49:56.920
3.

02:49:56.920 --> 02:50:01.280
I mean, at this point, it's like, even with Modern Warfare 3, even the fact they have

02:50:01.280 --> 02:50:04.000
dedicated servers, they're only for unranked.

02:50:04.000 --> 02:50:08.300
So it's like, if I wanted to level up in that game, I would have to put up with the peer

02:50:08.300 --> 02:50:11.000
to peer crap, which is like not good on the PC.

02:50:11.000 --> 02:50:12.000
It's a horrible experience.

02:50:12.000 --> 02:50:13.760
It's only meant for consoles.

02:50:13.760 --> 02:50:19.840
I think the way I see it is like Activision giving us like half, it's like going halfway

02:50:19.840 --> 02:50:24.840
instead of actually like, you know, doing what they did before, like with the first

02:50:24.840 --> 02:50:25.920
Modern Warfare.

02:50:25.920 --> 02:50:31.960
What about if you can set up these controlled, super easy environments where somebody could

02:50:31.960 --> 02:50:35.920
just have a server that's for nothing but ranking up quickly and it would kind of ruin

02:50:35.920 --> 02:50:36.920
things?

02:50:36.920 --> 02:50:37.920
Like I can kind of see that side of it.

02:50:37.920 --> 02:50:38.920
Well, that's the thing.

02:50:38.920 --> 02:50:49.040
I mean, I played Modern Warfare on PC with the servers and I was able to rank up easily.

02:50:49.040 --> 02:50:53.640
Then again, I have like skill with the keyboard and mouse, but the point is that it didn't

02:50:53.640 --> 02:50:56.040
really impact cheating as much.

02:50:56.040 --> 02:51:02.160
Because either way, once they spotted you as a cheater, you automatically get kicked

02:51:02.160 --> 02:51:04.000
and banned from that server.

02:51:04.000 --> 02:51:06.600
You know, Punkbuster works pretty well.

02:51:06.600 --> 02:51:07.600
It's a pretty good hammer.

02:51:07.600 --> 02:51:10.880
Yeah, but it's leveling up quickly cheating?

02:51:10.880 --> 02:51:16.080
Well, cheating in the sense of like when they find people hacking or cheating in that particular

02:51:16.080 --> 02:51:19.880
server, you know, the admins boot them really fast.

02:51:19.880 --> 02:51:27.680
But I could see why Activision is trying to like release their half-baked solution for

02:51:27.680 --> 02:51:32.720
the lack of any servers in Modern Warfare 2.

02:51:32.720 --> 02:51:37.340
They still want to push Elite, that whole Elite thing.

02:51:37.340 --> 02:51:44.400
And the fact that I guess having a dedicated server ranked, they believe that they will

02:51:44.400 --> 02:51:47.040
probably game the system that way.

02:51:47.040 --> 02:51:51.480
You know, you have folks that find exploits that aren't really patched or more importantly

02:51:51.480 --> 02:51:55.760
you set up a server just for like the sake of ranking really fast.

02:51:55.760 --> 02:52:00.680
I know Team Fortress 2 had this issue back in the day where it's just like people just

02:52:00.680 --> 02:52:05.760
idling in order to get like unlocks.

02:52:05.760 --> 02:52:07.640
But yeah, I could see why they did that.

02:52:07.640 --> 02:52:13.180
I mean, Battlefield 3 has dedicated servers, but it's like, I know they're, it's almost

02:52:13.180 --> 02:52:19.280
like Bad Company 2 where everything's going to be like from their third-party providers.

02:52:19.280 --> 02:52:21.520
But it's still a good solution though.

02:52:21.520 --> 02:52:28.320
Well, I mean, at the end of the day, you're going to buy both games no matter what, right?

02:52:28.320 --> 02:52:30.380
I'm probably going to just stick with Battlefield 3.

02:52:30.380 --> 02:52:31.880
I've already made my decision.

02:52:31.880 --> 02:52:36.240
I'm not going to touch Modern Warfare 3 unless I can pick it up for dirt cheap.

02:52:36.240 --> 02:52:40.240
Otherwise I'm just going to stick with Battlefield 3.

02:52:40.240 --> 02:52:44.240
I know it's not on Steam and I'm going to, you know, I'm going to have to bite the bullet

02:52:44.240 --> 02:52:45.720
and give Origin a shot.

02:52:45.720 --> 02:52:49.240
Well, props to you sticking by your guns and voting with your dollars.

02:52:49.240 --> 02:52:50.240
You know, that's what we always say.

02:52:50.240 --> 02:52:51.240
Exactly.

02:52:51.240 --> 02:52:52.240
If you feel strongly enough, vote with your dollars.

02:52:52.240 --> 02:52:53.240
All right, Zach.

02:52:53.240 --> 02:52:56.680
We're going to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but have fun and hopefully see you

02:52:56.680 --> 02:52:57.680
in next week's show.

02:52:57.680 --> 02:52:58.680
You're not too busy playing Battlefield.

02:52:58.680 --> 02:52:59.680
Well, that's the thing.

02:52:59.680 --> 02:53:04.320
If I can get a computer in like a week, which I doubt, it's going to take a few more weeks

02:53:04.320 --> 02:53:05.920
for me to spec out everything.

02:53:05.920 --> 02:53:09.600
All right, then we know when you disappear what happened.

02:53:09.600 --> 02:53:10.600
Exactly.

02:53:10.600 --> 02:53:11.600
All right.

02:53:11.600 --> 02:53:12.600
Take care, buddy.

02:53:12.600 --> 02:53:13.600
All right.

02:53:13.600 --> 02:53:14.600
Bye.

02:53:14.600 --> 02:53:15.600
All right.

02:53:15.600 --> 02:53:16.600
That's going to do it for Skype calls tonight.

02:53:16.600 --> 02:53:20.240
For those who didn't get through, sorry, but try writing us an email, Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

02:53:20.240 --> 02:53:23.600
I want to quickly wrap up the rest of these tweets, though, real quick.

02:53:23.600 --> 02:53:26.360
Osfer tweets us saying a couple things.

02:53:26.360 --> 02:53:29.000
First, I'm watching people play the new Spyro.

02:53:29.000 --> 02:53:31.760
It doesn't look nearly as bad as Loki describes.

02:53:31.760 --> 02:53:35.260
Loki, it's just you're too harsh on him.

02:53:35.260 --> 02:53:41.400
It's all about, not necessarily the gameplay, but the message behind it.

02:53:41.400 --> 02:53:43.160
It sets precedent.

02:53:43.160 --> 02:53:46.880
And Osfer also asks, random question for the staff.

02:53:46.880 --> 02:53:48.560
Who is your favorite Pokemon?

02:53:48.560 --> 02:53:50.720
Mine is Mewtwo.

02:53:50.720 --> 02:53:51.720
I have an answer for this.

02:53:51.720 --> 02:53:54.320
Does anyone else on staff have a way to answer for this?

02:53:54.320 --> 02:53:55.320
SalaciousPop?

02:53:55.320 --> 02:53:57.440
You watch or play Pokemon?

02:53:57.440 --> 02:53:58.440
Bidoof.

02:53:58.440 --> 02:53:59.440
What's Bidoof?

02:53:59.440 --> 02:54:02.120
I've never heard of Bidoof, or did you make that up?

02:54:02.120 --> 02:54:07.520
No, I need to Google it, but he's the little squirrel that's stupid, and he's like the

02:54:07.520 --> 02:54:09.560
worst Pokemon ever.

02:54:09.560 --> 02:54:13.640
My favorite Pokemon by far is Jigglypuff, the one that gets really pissed off when she

02:54:13.640 --> 02:54:17.160
sings and puts everyone to sleep, that she draws on their face with a marker.

02:54:17.160 --> 02:54:19.120
Those are always my favorite episodes of the old show.

02:54:19.120 --> 02:54:20.760
Loki, do you have a favorite Pokemon?

02:54:20.760 --> 02:54:25.280
I don't know any of the Pokemon.

02:54:25.280 --> 02:54:27.400
One of these days, I want to convince Loki to a bet.

02:54:27.400 --> 02:54:29.940
I mean, obviously, we're never going to get him to dress up as the Tingle outfit, but

02:54:29.940 --> 02:54:32.000
we have to think of other things that would be awesome.

02:54:32.000 --> 02:54:36.600
And I think one of them would be that Loki would have to sing the Pokemon rap on air.

02:54:36.600 --> 02:54:41.040
Aww, that's a cute little derpy mon.

02:54:41.040 --> 02:54:42.040
I like that.

02:54:42.040 --> 02:54:43.040
Is that the one you...

02:54:43.040 --> 02:54:44.040
That's Bidoof.

02:54:44.040 --> 02:54:45.600
Bidoof?

02:54:45.600 --> 02:54:47.400
On YouTube, everyone should Google.

02:54:47.400 --> 02:54:51.860
It was UPN's Cartoon Afternoons.

02:54:51.860 --> 02:54:56.760
It was one of the bumpers they made between Batman, the animated series, and Pokemon.

02:54:56.760 --> 02:55:00.400
And it's Batman Sings Jigglypuff, and if you find it, you should just pull it up right

02:55:00.400 --> 02:55:01.400
now.

02:55:01.400 --> 02:55:02.400
It's super awesome.

02:55:02.400 --> 02:55:05.080
It's a bumper that UPN made.

02:55:05.080 --> 02:55:07.760
Could it be this right here?

02:55:07.760 --> 02:55:10.680
Jigglypuff, a balloon Pokemon.

02:55:10.680 --> 02:55:12.120
Time for bed.

02:55:12.120 --> 02:55:14.440
All right, but a deal's a deal.

02:55:14.440 --> 02:55:15.440
No way.

02:55:15.440 --> 02:55:16.440
You promised.

02:55:16.440 --> 02:55:17.440
Jigglypuff, Jigglypuff.

02:55:17.440 --> 02:55:18.920
All right, good night.

02:55:18.920 --> 02:55:20.920
The whole thing.

02:55:20.920 --> 02:55:32.000
Jigglypuff, Jigglypuff, Jigglypuff.

02:55:32.000 --> 02:55:36.200
Pokemon, next on Kids WB.

02:55:36.200 --> 02:55:39.280
WB, not UPN, my bad.

02:55:39.280 --> 02:55:42.200
Ah, same thing now, it doesn't matter.

02:55:42.200 --> 02:55:43.200
Good times.

02:55:43.200 --> 02:55:45.200
I love Jigglypuff.

02:55:45.200 --> 02:55:48.520
Some tweets from Tigerclaw305, since it's a couple tweets.

02:55:48.520 --> 02:55:51.360
I thought you hit on this one earlier in the show, Loki.

02:55:51.360 --> 02:55:55.160
Was it the Portal 2 DLC that will have an in-game map editor with it?

02:55:55.160 --> 02:55:56.160
Yeah.

02:55:56.160 --> 02:55:57.280
I thought you'd mention something about that.

02:55:57.280 --> 02:56:00.880
Well, it does come with an in-game map editor as well, if you didn't already know.

02:56:00.880 --> 02:56:03.200
And that's cool.

02:56:03.200 --> 02:56:07.320
Because some of the best levels are gonna come from the users that make their own crazy

02:56:07.320 --> 02:56:08.320
shit.

02:56:08.320 --> 02:56:11.840
So I'm always happy to see level editors come to games.

02:56:11.840 --> 02:56:16.240
It seems like it's a little late, but I guess if it extends the life of the game, then yay,

02:56:16.240 --> 02:56:17.240
right?

02:56:17.240 --> 02:56:18.240
Yeah.

02:56:18.240 --> 02:56:24.640
This is another tweet about Mass Effect 3's demo will be out early for Battlefield 3 buyers

02:56:24.640 --> 02:56:27.280
if you get it new.

02:56:27.280 --> 02:56:30.920
Yet another spin on the Project $10, but at least this one isn't as bad.

02:56:30.920 --> 02:56:35.480
I mean, an early demo, that's more of a reasonable kind of perk, right?

02:56:35.480 --> 02:56:40.460
So there's gonna be a demo for Mass Effect 3 in January, and it was announced by BioWare.

02:56:40.460 --> 02:56:42.920
More information will be on BioWare's forums.

02:56:42.920 --> 02:56:48.680
But if you redeem the online pass for Battlefield 3, it will be available earlier to you.

02:56:48.680 --> 02:56:51.320
Mass Effect 3, by the way, is supposed to have multiplayer support.

02:56:51.320 --> 02:56:53.280
That was confirmed earlier this month.

02:56:53.280 --> 02:56:57.000
And it's gonna have an online co-op mode that can affect the single-player game.

02:56:57.000 --> 02:56:58.000
Interesting.

02:56:58.000 --> 02:57:03.560
So yep, if you activate a Battlefield 3 online pass on any of the platforms, I guess the

02:57:03.560 --> 02:57:09.080
EA account, your account will just be enabled with this access to get the demo.

02:57:09.080 --> 02:57:12.840
So that's kinda cool on whatever system the code was redeemed on.

02:57:12.840 --> 02:57:13.840
So...

02:57:13.840 --> 02:57:16.200
Or actually, no, I take that back.

02:57:16.200 --> 02:57:18.660
It doesn't have to be for the account that you bought it on.

02:57:18.660 --> 02:57:23.560
It says that the access is applied to the EA account, so meaning if you buy Battlefield

02:57:23.560 --> 02:57:27.200
3 on the PC, you can get the demo on the PlayStation 3, or whatever you wanna do.

02:57:27.200 --> 02:57:30.200
So it's kind of tradeable amongst those.

02:57:30.200 --> 02:57:31.960
That's kinda neat.

02:57:31.960 --> 02:57:35.040
There will be other ways for the rest of us to get in there if you're not buying Battlefield

02:57:35.040 --> 02:57:38.680
3, so don't cry.

02:57:38.680 --> 02:57:43.920
Lastly but not leastly, a couple of tweets from Ramaditya Knight sends us some tweets.

02:57:43.920 --> 02:57:44.920
Hey, OLR!

02:57:44.920 --> 02:57:50.000
The Sonic 1 and 2 soundtrack to celebrate his 20th birthday has been released this month,

02:57:50.000 --> 02:57:51.560
so if you're a Sonic fan, you should go get it.

02:57:51.560 --> 02:57:54.720
I seem to remember a story on that coming up before, like when it was first announced,

02:57:54.720 --> 02:57:56.600
but it's good to know that it's out.

02:57:56.600 --> 02:58:02.320
And you might remember that name, Ramaditya Knight does a lot of these tin whistle or

02:58:02.320 --> 02:58:03.680
the recorder.

02:58:03.680 --> 02:58:07.640
He does a lot of these songs, and he sent us a new YouTube at his account, which is

02:58:07.640 --> 02:58:16.440
Ramaditya Skywalker, and he's actually playing the Green Hill Zone theme.

02:58:16.440 --> 02:58:23.440
Obviously he's using the background, but that might not be the best part, where he's playing

02:58:23.440 --> 02:58:26.440
the same three notes over and over.

02:58:26.440 --> 02:58:29.600
That's a little better.

02:58:29.600 --> 02:58:31.440
Still irritating.

02:58:31.440 --> 02:58:36.520
Hey, hey, hey, I don't see you playing a musical instrument, I don't think you should be making

02:58:36.520 --> 02:58:37.520
fun.

02:58:37.520 --> 02:58:39.120
I don't think you should be making fun.

02:58:39.120 --> 02:58:42.520
I think you're talented, don't listen to Loki.

02:58:42.520 --> 02:58:44.880
I played the clarinet when I was younger.

02:58:44.880 --> 02:58:45.880
You sure did.

02:58:45.880 --> 02:58:47.280
I sure did.

02:58:47.280 --> 02:58:50.520
I probably couldn't play that on the clarinet anymore, I could probably play the squeak

02:58:50.520 --> 02:58:53.280
song, that's probably about all I could play on the clarinet these days.

02:58:53.280 --> 02:58:54.280
Band geek.

02:58:54.280 --> 02:58:57.360
Shut up, what's wrong with being a band geek?

02:58:57.360 --> 02:59:01.000
I tried to be a band geek, but I was too weak to carry my instrument and I was picked on.

02:59:01.000 --> 02:59:03.520
That's because you tried to play the fucking tuba, and you were-

02:59:03.520 --> 02:59:04.520
No, trombone.

02:59:04.520 --> 02:59:05.520
Oh, my bad.

02:59:05.520 --> 02:59:07.600
You were like this, weren't you like a really scrawny kid?

02:59:07.600 --> 02:59:08.600
Oh, yeah.

02:59:08.600 --> 02:59:11.600
And now you're like six foot four, like you just-

02:59:11.600 --> 02:59:16.640
I'm still weak as hell, but I'm six foot four-ish, so there's at least a lot of me, yeah.

02:59:16.640 --> 02:59:23.040
All right, and the chat room is asking for a link of Ramaditya Knight's performance there,

02:59:23.040 --> 02:59:28.400
and stupid me forgot to link that, so let me do that right now for the chatters in the

02:59:28.400 --> 02:59:33.960
chat room at chat.orangelaungeradio.com, there you go.

02:59:33.960 --> 02:59:39.240
There it is, and Rama says in chat room, chat.orangelaungeradio.com, and now Skye plays the skin flute.

02:59:39.240 --> 02:59:41.360
Yeah, screw you.

02:59:41.360 --> 02:59:43.840
All right.

02:59:43.840 --> 02:59:45.200
That's it, we're done.

02:59:45.200 --> 02:59:46.960
We're wrapping up another episode of Orange Lawns Radio.

02:59:46.960 --> 02:59:50.400
I gotta ask first if there's any last minute stories, Loki?

02:59:50.400 --> 02:59:52.600
Yeah, there's just one.

02:59:52.600 --> 03:00:01.840
It was basically, they announced that in Sonic Generations, you can unlock the original Sonic

03:00:01.840 --> 03:00:04.080
the Hedgehog game.

03:00:04.080 --> 03:00:05.080
Again?

03:00:05.080 --> 03:00:06.720
Yeah, that's totally new news.

03:00:06.720 --> 03:00:09.440
How many times did they release the first Sonic game for real?

03:00:09.440 --> 03:00:14.040
Absolutely, brand new news, unless you listened to our show back in August, in which I actually

03:00:14.040 --> 03:00:15.680
revealed that same thing.

03:00:15.680 --> 03:00:18.640
So yeah, totally new.

03:00:18.640 --> 03:00:24.920
Well, if you somehow missed out on your nine other opportunities to re-buy Sonic the Hedgehog,

03:00:24.920 --> 03:00:26.960
the original, here you go.

03:00:26.960 --> 03:00:31.080
Sonic Generations is a bet, and they have a couple dev ones now if you wanna check them

03:00:31.080 --> 03:00:32.080
out.

03:00:32.080 --> 03:00:33.080
All right.

03:00:33.080 --> 03:00:35.360
Well, that's gonna wrap up another episode of Orange Lawns Radio.

03:00:35.360 --> 03:00:38.080
We're gonna go around first and get everybody's final thought.

03:00:38.080 --> 03:00:42.160
And my final thought tonight is skinny fries.

03:00:42.160 --> 03:00:43.160
I am full of them.

03:00:43.160 --> 03:00:44.160
We ate that whole bag.

03:00:44.160 --> 03:00:45.160
I know, we're fat.

03:00:45.160 --> 03:00:46.160
Actually, you know what though?

03:00:46.160 --> 03:00:47.800
In that entire bag, there's only six grams of fat.

03:00:47.800 --> 03:00:48.800
That's not that bad.

03:00:48.800 --> 03:00:50.800
There's more grams of fat in a muffin.

03:00:50.800 --> 03:00:51.800
All right.

03:00:51.800 --> 03:00:53.000
So let's just pop.

03:00:53.000 --> 03:00:54.000
What's your final thought tonight?

03:00:54.000 --> 03:00:56.880
Thank you for being here, by the way, and filling in.

03:00:56.880 --> 03:00:57.880
Always appreciate it.

03:00:57.880 --> 03:00:58.880
You're welcome.

03:00:58.880 --> 03:00:59.880
Always a pleasure.

03:00:59.880 --> 03:01:00.880
Thank you.

03:01:00.880 --> 03:01:01.880
Thank you for the food.

03:01:01.880 --> 03:01:02.880
Because I'm hungry.

03:01:02.880 --> 03:01:05.440
Are you getting a headache again?

03:01:05.440 --> 03:01:06.440
Kind of.

03:01:06.440 --> 03:01:07.440
My stomach's been kickin'.

03:01:07.440 --> 03:01:08.440
Poor thing.

03:01:08.440 --> 03:01:10.000
And low-key, last but not least, your final thought tonight.

03:01:10.000 --> 03:01:12.120
Crackers need to get crackin'.

03:01:12.120 --> 03:01:14.000
All right.

03:01:14.000 --> 03:01:16.200
That's gonna do it for another episode of Orange Lawns Radio.

03:01:16.200 --> 03:01:21.040
If you liked our show, you know all we ask you guys, tell a friend or two about the show.

03:01:21.040 --> 03:01:25.040
We don't have advertising, big dollars, you know, we're not a huge operation.

03:01:25.040 --> 03:01:27.280
Word of mouth is really what keeps our show alive.

03:01:27.280 --> 03:01:29.080
Leave us a nice review on iTunes if you could.

03:01:29.080 --> 03:01:30.760
We haven't gotten any of those in a long time.

03:01:30.760 --> 03:01:32.320
It's been about a month or two.

03:01:32.320 --> 03:01:34.560
So we really appreciate those.

03:01:34.560 --> 03:01:39.020
Listen to Hoard House, if you like World of Warcraft or Blizzard stuff, HoardHouse.com.

03:01:39.020 --> 03:01:43.160
And of course, this is the last time we can ask you to do this, so please, please write

03:01:43.160 --> 03:01:44.260
yourself a reminder.

03:01:44.260 --> 03:01:48.800
Ask Siri to remind you every day, vote in the podcast awards for Orange Lawns Radio.

03:01:48.800 --> 03:01:50.400
Best gaming podcast.

03:01:50.400 --> 03:01:54.280
Really appreciate a vote for our friends over at the Geek Spin and Pod Safe Music as well.

03:01:54.280 --> 03:01:55.280
You know, help us win.

03:01:55.280 --> 03:01:56.580
That'll go a long way in promoting.

03:01:56.580 --> 03:01:59.000
We really, really appreciate every single vote.

03:01:59.000 --> 03:02:02.200
Even if we don't win, we have really felt a lot of love from the community, which has

03:02:02.200 --> 03:02:03.200
been great.

03:02:03.200 --> 03:02:06.980
Like, you know, I've seen like other podcasters like retweeting and like supporting us, especially

03:02:06.980 --> 03:02:07.980
the All Games family.

03:02:07.980 --> 03:02:12.320
So I really, before we sign off tonight, want to give a heartfelt thank you to all the All

03:02:12.320 --> 03:02:16.520
Games people who have really rallied behind us and in helping us to win.

03:02:16.520 --> 03:02:24.600
And if, if, if, if, if we do win, it will be in large part thanks to that and all of

03:02:24.600 --> 03:02:25.600
their efforts.

03:02:25.600 --> 03:02:28.320
So really, really, really appreciate it.

03:02:28.320 --> 03:02:30.560
So I guess that's going to do it.

03:02:30.560 --> 03:02:31.560
We'll be back next week.

03:02:31.560 --> 03:02:33.080
Dark Sakura will be back from Disneyland.

03:02:33.080 --> 03:02:36.740
I'm sure to tell us all about her adventures on Space Mountain, maybe at Electronica or

03:02:36.740 --> 03:02:38.200
whatever else she's been doing there.

03:02:38.200 --> 03:02:44.800
And we'll talk about whatever else comes up in gaming with our bit of wit and sassy commentary.

03:02:44.800 --> 03:02:47.740
Until then, be safe.

03:02:47.740 --> 03:02:48.740
Don't be a dick.

03:02:48.740 --> 03:02:49.740
We'll see you next week.

03:02:49.740 --> 03:02:53.740
