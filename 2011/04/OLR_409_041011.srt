Who's your hosts? Dark Sakura, Sky, and Lotu!

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Tonight, April 10th, 2011, has the 3DS sold up to expectations in Japan,

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:27,000
a new Sonic game is revealed, and after many years, a fan Streets of Rage remake is released.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio,

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
the show where every gamer has a voice. We do tape live every Sunday night at All Games Radio,

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
www.allgames.com, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
My name is Rob Roberts, I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-host,

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers!

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Rob has renewed my faith in computing.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
How's that?

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
By giving me a task of revival.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You're gonna CPR on one of my dead computers, yeah.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Because I've needed, I've been going through this dilemma where I can't get Maya working on my computer,

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
and I'm gonna put Windows 7 and Dual Boot Linux on it, but in the meantime it's like, I still really want a Mac.

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
And I have a Mac, it's old, and as far as I know it doesn't work, and I replaced the laptop a long time ago,

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I just ended up getting a PC laptop because it was really cheap and I didn't have a lot of money at the time.

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
So yeah, the PC one's been serving me fine, so if you can revive that Mac one, shit, have fun with it.

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The other thought is I'm gonna put Linux on it.

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Of course. When in doubt, just install Linux on it.

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Hey, also with us tonight, say hello to the one and only tech master, Loki, who's joining us.

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Hello.

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
And at least he has chicken.

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Yes.

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
How you doing, Loki, how are things for you?

27
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Doing fine.

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Yeah?

29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
My hands are sticky so I'm trying to figure out how to hold the microphone without, you know.

30
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Alright, I'll leave you alone so you can finish chicken.

31
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It's just a radio program we do pretty consistently every week here at six o'clock.

32
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You know what? Here's your trivia for the night.

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
What's that?

34
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Sticky Fingers, the Rolling Stones album, had a zipper on the thing and also had a guy with a boner on it.

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
What?

36
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Seriously, the album, it has like a shot of a guy's crotch and it had a zipper on it where you can unzip the jeans.

37
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
But the guy had a big boner when they took the picture, so.

38
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
How nice that is.

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
And it was Sticky Fingers.

40
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Right.

41
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
So, there's your trivia.

42
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
We're going to get into our gaming weeks, but nobody else in the studio tonight, just the three of us here.

43
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You guys, though, are joining us, always the fourth guest with us, our chat room.

44
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Chat.orangelaunchradio.com if you want to chat with us live as you tape live on this Sunday night.

45
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Just kind of like a live note or whatever.

46
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
We're really delayed or what have you on the feed.

47
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I don't know what's up. It's like two to three minutes behind.

48
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
So, when we say something and when you guys see it.

49
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
So, you'll have to forgive us a little bit if we're going back to sort.

50
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Because we want to make sure the chat has a chance to get feedback on stories.

51
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
We may have to go back a little bit to do that.

52
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I don't know why things are so, well, I do know why things are so delayed, but it's nothing we can really fix, sadly.

53
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
So, we're just going to have to deal with it. Yay!

54
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Anyhow, let's get into our gaming weeks, the types of video games you've been playing this week.

55
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Always a nice conversation starter.

56
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Doc Soccer, how was your gaming week?

57
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
For the record, I just posted a picture of the album cover with the boner.

58
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
So.

59
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Thank you.

60
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I played a little Dragon Age 2.

61
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I am finally into the second act and totally enjoying the game.

62
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I've given up on my lesbian love because Fenris showed up.

63
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I see.

64
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Broody elf dude.

65
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
And he's almost like a chick, so that's cool.

66
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
He's a very girly man.

67
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
He whines a lot, so.

68
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
But at least, like, the dwarf makes fun of him for it.

69
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
And so they just bite back and forth.

70
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
They're so much fun.

71
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Although, although, although I'm still building a little bit of relationship with Meryl, so maybe I'll have them both.

72
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
And then I could totally sleep with Isabella anytime I want to because she's a slut.

73
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Um.

74
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Then, um.

75
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I, uh.

76
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
We're actually going to be getting back into playing Final Fantasy, Dan and I are, but we did not start yet because he just got back on Wednesday.

77
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And, um.

78
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Playing, um.

79
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
World of Warcraft, of course.

80
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:16,000
And I am almost at exalted with the stupid drunken dwarves and I don't have to do the stupid motion sickness inducing drunken quest again.

81
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Hopefully soon.

82
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
You know which one I'm talking about, don't you?

83
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Where you have to, like, drink ten things of ale and then you get all the fuzzy effects and everything.

84
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
And I'm like, motion sick, it makes me want to puke every time I do it.

85
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Yeah, it's, it's pretty, you gotta be careful with that because it even messes me up.

86
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I still refuse to do the beer run, for the record, because it's fucking annoying.

87
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
But I finally got exalted with kitty people and have badass shoes.

88
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
And a camel.

89
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Oh my god shoes.

90
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Oh my god shoes.

91
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
And then I got Rebecca Black to twenty.

92
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Yes, you actually have a character named Rebecca Black.

93
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Did you roll her on a Friday?

94
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Yes I did.

95
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Yes I did.

96
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Fun, fun, fun, fun.

97
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
She's actually, it turns out, because I made her a human paladin as a joke.

98
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
And it turns out I really like a human paladin.

99
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
So I've kept the character.

100
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
So, who knew?

101
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
And then I always get, you know, people lull when I go into town, so it's funny.

102
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Done.

103
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Alright, Loki, if you're done with your chicken, tell us about your gaming week.

104
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Um, I'm gonna play a whole lot.

105
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Mainly just Grand Theft Auto, as usual.

106
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Um, other than Grand Theft Auto, I played a little bit of Game Dev Story.

107
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Just very briefly.

108
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Little bit of Rerave.

109
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Um, download the new song packs just for the hell of it.

110
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
And that was kind of fun.

111
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:45,000
And then, um, actually some excitebots last night, until the Wii broke.

112
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
But it was fun, unless...

113
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It'll be fixed soon.

114
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Yeah, you were telling me when you came in here, like, well I broke my Wii last night, and I said, well the good news is it's just a Wii.

115
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Yeah, it's true, and we haven't played that in a long time.

116
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
It's kind of sad though, because I was looking forward to, like, playing some more stuff on there.

117
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
But, um, it'll be fixed soon. It's not a big deal.

118
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
It's just inconvenient right now.

119
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
That I have to lose my progress.

120
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
This is only a flesh wound.

121
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Well, we've been so much out of excitebots for the longest time.

122
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I mean, it's kind of a learning curve to get back in and remember, like, how to be so kickass at it.

123
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
But, it's still fun.

124
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,000
So there's a question for Dark Soccer in our chat room from, and I know this person has this name just to get me to read it.

125
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
But it's from iFarTed.

126
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It says, StarSakura question in our chat room.

127
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:41,000
At chat.orangestonesmedia.com, would you recommend Dragon Age Origins and Dragon Age 2 to someone that's moderately into MMOs?

128
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Well, my answer was, I like DA too. I haven't played DAO, honestly.

129
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Um, I, it doesn't really have a feel of an MMO. It just has a feel of a fun kind of adventure game.

130
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
So, I've recommended anybody. It's pretty fun.

131
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I mean, if the type of running around and picking up clues and doing quests in different parts of towns is not your cup of tea, then go get your coffee elsewhere.

132
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:18,000
And MMOs are so diverse too. Like, it's really hard to say, you know, people that are into WoW may not necessarily be into, I don't know, DC Universe online.

133
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
You know, and the people into that might not be into the same, you know, MMOs are a pretty vast market now.

134
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Well, every time I start to get just a little bit bored with Dragon Age 2, one of the characters will say something so hilarious that I keep laughing.

135
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:37,000
And then I found, um, the, uh, uh, experience cheat. Well, it's more like a glitch in the game where you can get an experience in gold.

136
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Which really helped. So now I really like the game.

137
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
There you go.

138
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Well, I didn't find it. Tiara told me about it, but then I did it by accident.

139
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Because I wasn't really gonna do it, except I managed to get in the right spot, so I was like, maybe I will!

140
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop A button.

141
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Um, we also have a blast from the past in our chat room tonight. Check this out, DDR Angel's in chat.

142
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I don't think I've seen her in chat since like episode 130? Maybe? No, it's probably later than that, but still.

143
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Uh, so DDR Angel's in chat saying, you can turn the drunk effect off. I actually never knew that. I don't doubt that that's not true.

144
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
You can set down your graphic settings to do it.

145
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
You, yeah.

146
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I think.

147
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
There's probably a way you can just go in and turn it off.

148
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I'm lazy, and honestly...

149
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I never knew either. I just always thought the way to not get the effects to do that, don't drink.

150
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
It's just like real life.

151
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Well, yeah, but you have to drink till you finish the class. You have to drink ten things of ale.

152
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Oh, yeah. I forgot about that.

153
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
But you know what? I'll tell you how long it takes me to do the Warhammer crap now.

154
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Wildhammer. No, I was talking about Warhammer because my friend Gary and I were talking and we were talking about how annoying Warhammer is.

155
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I hate Warhammer. Anyway.

156
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Um, Wildhammer. I can do it in like ten minutes now. It's like super fast and easy.

157
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Oh, all the dailies?

158
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Yeah.

159
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Yeah.

160
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
It's like a beer run. Because I hate that one. So I just refuse to do it.

161
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I hate the Wildhammer quest. But that's a talk for another show.

162
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Yes.

163
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
All right. Sorry, Loki. I don't think you were quite done with your gaming week because I see you've opened up this little...

164
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
You've opened up your package that you brought with you.

165
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Of course. No, this week as kind of a random thing, we had guests. Celebrity guests at my work.

166
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:16,000
So out of, I don't know, just trying to be funny, I guess, I had them sign my 360.

167
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
So I have my JTAG 360, by the way.

168
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I have it signed by Orlando Bloom, Mark Ruffalo, and Christopher...

169
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
What was it? I'm trying to remember his last name now.

170
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
That was the lowest build of the three.

171
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Yeah.

172
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
But yeah, it's pretty awesome.

173
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Oh, Christopher Thornton.

174
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
It's going up on the OLR thing now.

175
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Yeah, somebody posted the video. We had a little video stumble on our site.

176
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I think somebody found the, one of our authors found the video that you posted on YouTube where you're like, hi.

177
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Well, we have guests here today and I didn't have anything for them to sign. So I brought my Xbox 360.

178
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I could have used it.

179
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
See if they actually sign it.

180
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
But why do that? That's not as cool.

181
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
And by the way...

182
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
My favorite is what the guy says. Hold on. I'm just walking up.

183
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I feel embarrassed.

184
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
It's a hard drive.

185
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Oh, an Xbox 360.

186
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I don't have anything to sign other than this, so...

187
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
That's cool.

188
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Let's do it, dude.

189
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I've never signed an Xbox.

190
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Awesome.

191
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
That's Orlando Bloom, by the way, that doesn't know what the thing is.

192
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I've never signed an Xbox.

193
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Yeah.

194
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Who to?

195
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Uh, Matt.

196
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Matt?

197
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Yeah.

198
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Matt, play hard.

199
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
That's what he signed it as. Matt, play hard.

200
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Yeah, that's good.

201
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
That's awesome.

202
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Thank you, Matt.

203
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
It's poorly filmed because I had to hold the Xbox in.

204
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Wait, wait. My favorite is the part coming out.

205
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Nice.

206
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Is that the one with the blue light?

207
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Is that the one with the blue light?

208
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
No, just DVDs.

209
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I don't know.

210
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
HD DVDs?

211
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Do you think that'll play out?

212
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I don't know what it was.

213
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Aww, actors are real people, too. They don't know what they're...

214
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
It's cool. He's busy. I mean, he doesn't have time to play games.

215
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Well, if you like, I have spray fixative.

216
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
So it won't come off.

217
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I don't think it's gonna come off anyways.

218
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Well, I've had stuff come off of plastic before, so...

219
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Wait, but this way.

220
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Well, don't wash it. You'll be fine.

221
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I'm not gonna wash it.

222
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
No, I have a ton of signed posters and stuff by different celebrities coming in.

223
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Not big celebrities. A couple.

224
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
We've had, like, um...

225
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I'm trying to think of some of the people we had.

226
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Uh...

227
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Yeah, none of them are really big celebrities.

228
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
But my posters are sitting under a sack of magazines at my desk.

229
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
And this goes with me to and from work all the time.

230
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
All the more reason to have some fixative.

231
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
That is a higher honor for them, yeah.

232
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
All the more reason to have some fixative.

233
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Um, I'm moving this week. It's something big I'm doing right now, obviously.

234
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
And I found some of my autographed pictures.

235
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
And one of the autographed pictures I found the other day was the autographed picture of Scott Wolf.

236
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
From Party of Five that you got me.

237
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
That's right. I remember that now.

238
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Ah, Scott Wolf. He is a tiny...

239
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Now he's on V.

240
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
He is so tiny.

241
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
No, but, um...

242
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
But so dreamy.

243
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
No, they were actually really cool.

244
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Because, you know, most of the celebrity guests we have, you know, don't really...

245
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
They kind of just make their appearance and go.

246
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
They're just, like, all chilling in the audience with different people.

247
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Um, and just, you know, chatting up people and talking about movies and that kind of stuff.

248
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
So, it was really cool.

249
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:23,000
It was for a movie called, uh, Sympathy for Delicious, I think is what it was.

250
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Or something like that.

251
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Sounds yummy.

252
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
It... It's... It's kind of cool.

253
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Um...

254
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
So...

255
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Yeah, it was... I don't know. It was just kind of funny.

256
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,000
So this must be worth three million dollars if the Sarah Palin one's worth one million dollars.

257
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
There was a Sarah Palin Xbox worth a million dollars?

258
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Well, it's not worth a million dollars.

259
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
It's put up on eBay for a million dollars.

260
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I see.

261
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
No one's gonna buy it.

262
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
But you're not gonna put this on eBay.

263
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I'm not gonna put it on eBay.

264
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
You're gonna treasure this forever.

265
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Yes.

266
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
What did the wife say?

267
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
She thought it was funny.

268
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
She's like, nerd!

269
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Nerd!

270
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Alright, anything else for your gaming week?

271
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
That's it.

272
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Besides random celebrities signing your Xbox?

273
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Actually, you know what my coolest autographs are?

274
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Huh?

275
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I have three autographed Wil Wheaton books.

276
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Mm-hmm.

277
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
And I have, um, an autographed Jonathan Coulton CD.

278
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
And then I have my Facebook-style photo with him.

279
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Mm-hmm.

280
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
That he thought was hilarious.

281
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I think my most treasured autograph is my Paula Abdul autograph.

282
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
From the Under My Spell Tour.

283
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Oh, wow.

284
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
This is way before she was crazy on pills on American Idol.

285
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Actually, I take that back.

286
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,000
My greatest, like, legitimate autograph is, um, Yoko Kanno.

287
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Oh.

288
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Who did Macross Plus and, uh, Escaflowne and all that.

289
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Mm-hmm.

290
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Um, we've got her, uh, signing one of our Macross Plus CDs.

291
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Well, I'm gonna keep having people sign it.

292
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
To dance on.

293
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Are you gonna get more celebrities to sign it?

294
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Well, I was intending, I was hoping that they'd sign smaller, but they took up the whole

295
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
side of three people.

296
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I was gonna say, you should've told Orlando Bloom to write a little fuckin' smaller.

297
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Like, he took up half the...

298
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
That's like that dick that signed the entire page in my yearbook.

299
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
True story.

300
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
This one little jackass.

301
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Kids are such assholes.

302
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Especially the ones in high school.

303
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
This high school jackass signed in my yearbook.

304
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
It took up the entire page.

305
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
To Rob.

306
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
If you wanna get laid, climb up a chicken's ass and wait.

307
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Love, asshole.

308
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
But his real name.

309
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
And it took up the entire page.

310
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
What an ass.

311
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
You should scan that in and post it on his Facebook.

312
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I don't like I talk to the guy.

313
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Fuck him.

314
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Deceasing.

315
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Anyway.

316
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Anyways.

317
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
It's cool.

318
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I dig it.

319
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
So.

320
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Alright.

321
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I have to give a public thank you, by the way, to the lovely Marissa for the gift she

322
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
sent me of amber oil perfume from Solstice Scents.

323
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Very nice of her.

324
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
It smells pretty.

325
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
It smells like amber.

326
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Alright.

327
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
My gaming week.

328
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I gotta be honest.

329
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I've been moving, so I haven't had a lot in my gaming week, and I hate coming on here

330
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
on the show and saying, yeah, I have a video game podcast, so I haven't really been playing

331
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
any video games.

332
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
But I think I have a pretty legitimate excuse.

333
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I watched Alan play the Mortal Kombat demo, and, you know, nothing new there, although,

334
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,000
you know, I keep laughing at the horrible, horrible Molina fatality, because it's funny.

335
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
And then he was playing some other game, too, and you know this game, Dark Soccer, the minute

336
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I say it, it's the Strider dude did this on PlayStation 3.

337
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Moon Diver.

338
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Moon Diver.

339
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I've got it.

340
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I watched him play that.

341
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Super cool.

342
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
And I was, it's so funny, because he fired it up.

343
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I didn't know what it was.

344
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
He's like, oh, it's Moon Diver.

345
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
And I'm like, this fucking looks like Strider.

346
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
And then I thought, I'm like, oh, this must be the game that Jamie was telling me about

347
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
that it's by the guy who did Strider.

348
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Yeah, it's on PlayStation Network for like 15 bucks.

349
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Yeah.

350
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
It's kind of one of those things, I bet a lot of people don't know it's out there, but

351
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
if you like Strider, to be fair, I didn't play it.

352
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I just watched Alan play it, because literally, that was about all the gaming I did this week.

353
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
But I was like, wow, this looks just like Strider.

354
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I should check this out.

355
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
But it's four players simultaneous.

356
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Yes.

357
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
So I would love to do a full four player game on that.

358
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I bet it's a lot of fun.

359
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Lots of little sword.

360
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
But the thing I don't get is like in every one of his games in Japanese versions, you

361
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
get ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha every time the guy slashes his sword.

362
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
So I'm like, they took that out for the American Strider.

363
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Oh, that's good.

364
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Because he'd just go ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha the whole time.

365
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
But anyway.

366
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Alright, going to our chat room with some comments on our gaming weeks.

367
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

368
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Bobby Blackwolf wants to know, how many autographs has OLR signed for others?

369
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
That's a good question.

370
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
One or two.

371
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:33,000
We had one of the in the groove discs that we gave away that remember we fucked up the

372
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
cover of it.

373
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
The turbo graphics, I think there was something we signed, right?

374
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Yeah.

375
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Oh, we sent the turbo graphics to the winner and we all signed it in silver paint pen.

376
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,000
And there was, I think we sent like a thank you note or something to somebody who did

377
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
something for us and we included the ferret.

378
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I remember that.

379
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I got, I got pulled aside at Fonomy.

380
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Remember the last time I went?

381
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
To sign somebody's like costume prop.

382
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Like, okay.

383
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I might have signed one thing at PAX East.

384
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
You didn't give away the orange bat or something like that.

385
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
No.

386
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
We had, we did a new orange bat and gave that away.

387
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Yes.

388
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Because the original orange bat's in the closet behind you.

389
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
It's in the closet.

390
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Yeah.

391
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I don't have delusions that were like actually famous or whatever, but once in a while.

392
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I do.

393
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I'm delusional enough for all of us.

394
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
A random listener I just run into in an event.

395
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Of course.

396
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I have another autograph.

397
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I have an autograph screener from Rob Schneider, which is kind of odd.

398
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
He is, he is also very short.

399
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
A lot of actors, very short.

400
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
None of those people, not short.

401
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
God, I can't remember any actors' names today.

402
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
What the hell is wrong with me?

403
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
What was he in?

404
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
What'd he do?

405
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Jurassic Park.

406
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
He's now in Law and Order, Criminal Intent.

407
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Earth Girls Are Easy.

408
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Blank, blank, blank.

409
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Independence Day.

410
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Blank.

411
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Was it the dude that played the old guy?

412
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
No, not the old guy.

413
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
He was the smart guy who figured out the pattern.

414
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Oh.

415
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Oh, I know.

416
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Jeff Goldblum?

417
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Yes, Jeff Goldblum.

418
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I had Jeff Goldblum's autograph, and I such, I missed out on such an opportunity.

419
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I actually had from some random lots of records I bought, the soundtrack of Earth Girls Are

420
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Easy on vinyl.

421
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I could have had him sign it.

422
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I was like, ugh.

423
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
That would have been hilarious.

424
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
He probably would have laughed.

425
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
He probably would have thought that was really funny.

426
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I'm trying to think of some of the other ones.

427
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:42,000
We've had the son of the guy from on Three's Company.

428
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
John Ritter's son?

429
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Yeah, Jason Ritter.

430
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
He came out.

431
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
He was pretty cool.

432
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Just a lot of people.

433
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
That guy from Fargo.

434
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Now, when I worked at GNC, I met a lot of famous people, like the remaining members

435
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
of Sublime, and a bunch of wrestlers.

436
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Well, we're going to get into video game chat, right?

437
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Yeah.

438
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Hollywood chat.

439
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Gene Siskel out before he had his whole cancer thing.

440
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Just a couple quick comments from chat, because again, they're behind a little bit.

441
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
TigerKlaas says, Loki, you better cherish that 360 for as long as you can, because soon

442
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
you will see Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner and the Hulk in the Avengers movie.

443
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
That's right, I forgot about that.

444
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Oh, awesome.

445
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
He's going to be big time soon.

446
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I mean, he directed this movie, the movie that he came in to promote, and it was him

447
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:40,000
and the Christopher Thornton, because they were kind of roommates and stuff, and Christopher

448
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Thornton, he got in an accident, like a climbing accident, where he became paralyzed, and this

449
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
was kind of all about him and learning to deal with that.

450
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:56,000
And the movie's about him realizing he has the gift of healing, kind of like one of those

451
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,000
spiritual healers or something like that, and what he ends up doing with it, and it's

452
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
kind of interesting.

453
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
More comments from our chatroom at chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

454
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Who was saying about the DSI was Defective Candy said, my greatest autograph is my DSI

455
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
signed by Nobuo Uematsu.

456
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
That's a pretty good one, too.

457
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Oh, I know who else I have that actually made me super giddy to get.

458
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Koji Kondo.

459
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Ah, there you go.

460
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
When he was doing the Wii Orchestra thing.

461
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
And sj100matt says, I signed a shoe for Electric Sisterhood at PAX East.

462
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
See, I don't even remember that.

463
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I was drunk.

464
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
That's what I always say when I don't remember something that probably happened.

465
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I was drunk.

466
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Hey, I remember where one of the other ferrets went.

467
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I actually found one when I was moving.

468
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
You did?

469
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
You didn't bring it?

470
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
No.

471
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I'll bring it.

472
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Remember when one of the other ferrets got attached to the Katamari ball?

473
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
That's right.

474
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
At E3 one year.

475
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Alright, enough reminiscing, enough Hollywood chat.

476
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Let's get into a little bit of housekeeping.

477
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
No show next week.

478
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
We will not be here live next week.

479
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I gotta watch the kitty.

480
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Loki and myself have some other things we have to take care of.

481
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Dark Sakura would be a one-woman show otherwise.

482
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
And I don't think anyone wants to be subjected to that.

483
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Oh, I could totally go live.

484
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
It's gonna be called Bitches Listen.

485
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
That's what my new show's gonna be called.

486
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Wouldn't it be Listen to Bitches?

487
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Hee hee.

488
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Rob, you see what our listeners can't see?

489
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Heart!

490
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Only half of one.

491
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
So yeah, we won't be here next week, but we'll be back in two weeks.

492
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
So bear with us.

493
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Yep, that's really it.

494
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Otherwise, visit our website at orangelaunchradio.com, our Facebook at facebook.com slash orangelaunchradio,

495
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
twitter.com slash orangelaunchradio.

496
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
We're on all those sites.

497
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
All the social networking stuff.

498
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Alright, let's get into some actual gaming news.

499
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I don't know, it felt like after last week, this is kind of a slow news week, but there's

500
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
been some things worth mentioning.

501
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
A few things.

502
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:49,000
So, of course, it's coming out now, reports of just how well the 3DS sold in different

503
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:56,000
regions, and it says, you know, Nintendo said 1.5 million of the 4 million shipped handhelds

504
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
were headed for Japan by the end of March.

505
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:06,000
And I guess, according to the Japanese sales tracker, kind of like the MPD group over here,

506
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Mediacrate, there are still plenty of leftovers.

507
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:15,000
They're saying that they've only sold about 836,000 units, meaning that they're still

508
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:24,000
unbroken the 1 million mark in Japan, and still have about 664,000 units left.

509
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Yeah, I know from purchasing my Japanese system originally, yeah, it was pretty easy to get.

510
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
It was not, there were not shortages on this stuff.

511
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Now, I don't know, for me, I think under a million units at launch is kind of, for

512
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Nintendo, isn't good.

513
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I mean, it's, you would kind of expect them to sell well with their handhelds, because

514
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I mean, they have a pretty good market share over there, and people are kind of gung-ho

515
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:58,000
about that stuff, but I really think what hurt them was the lack of, you know, must

516
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
have titles at launch.

517
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Well, could it also be, I don't know, the earthquake and the tsunamis making people

518
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
think of other things over there than, you know, just 3D stuff?

519
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Yeah, okay, but the earthquake stuff happened, what, a couple weeks ago?

520
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Is that right?

521
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Yeah, I mean, okay, I get it, but, you know, there might have been some people that were

522
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
waiting a little bit, I don't know.

523
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Uh, no.

524
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
You can't deny that cut into sales, potential sales.

525
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I mean, okay, yeah, I mean, the launch day should have probably been bigger, but, you

526
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,000
know, the month totals are smaller because of the tragedy.

527
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Okay, well that's fine, I'll give you that, but I guarantee, and, you know, it's not gonna

528
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
catch up as quickly.

529
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I think what the thing is, is it's not enough, I mean, the 3D, and from what I've found,

530
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:54,000
just playing stuff, the 3D's cool, but there's no real must-have titles yet.

531
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I mean, like the stuff I bought, like Pilot Wings and Ridge Racer, it's kind of like,

532
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
okay, out of the stuff that's coming out, this is what I kind of think are the best

533
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
ones, you know, and that's it, it's not like, oh my god, I've got to have Ridge Racer

534
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
again, or oh my god, I've got to have Pilot Wings, it was just kind of, eh, okay, well,

535
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
this is what I've got to choose from, so I'm gonna pick this.

536
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:17,000
I don't think anyone's really super excited about a new Nintendogs, I mean, or Steel Diver.

537
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
That's true, I mean, it definitely hurt them to not have a Mario game, or a Zelda game,

538
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
or hell, the Kid Icarus game at launch.

539
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Or a new IP, for god's sake, I mean, you know, how about let's create something new?

540
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Well, Steel Diver, which I hear is kind of not all of that, but they definitely, you

541
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:40,000
know, somebody at Nintendo feels like it's a thing, so you know, there's that, that's

542
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
new.

543
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Yeah, but it's not something that they're really promoting, it's not like, you know,

544
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
a Kirby or Mario or something like that, it's just a game that they put out.

545
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
The Wii had the Zelda game, which was like a must-have, I mean, it was just a great game.

546
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,000
The Nintendo 64 had Mario 64, which many will argue is one of the greatest games of all

547
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
time, period.

548
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Right?

549
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Mario 64 was a launch game?

550
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Yeah.

551
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
I think, yeah.

552
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
GameCube, I don't recall having anything big.

553
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
I think it had, what, Luigi's Mansion.

554
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Yeah, Luigi's Mansion was the big one.

555
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Well, the first one, I guess.

556
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
So, but the GameCube also was challenged with sales to some regards, so.

557
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:23,000
And then I remember Mario 64 for the DS, and you know, Super Mario World for the Super

558
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Nintendo, and you know, Mario Brothers for the Nintendo.

559
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
So, it's just, I don't know.

560
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,000
And then also, once again, you know, people are kind of looking at the 3D as kind of gimmicky,

561
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:40,000
and also knowing, you know, their track record with just, not even really peripherals with

562
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
like, their hardware, it's like, eh, well, you know what?

563
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I'm not gonna buy one right away, because I know in like, a few months they're gonna

564
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
announce that they're gonna have a slimmer one, they're gonna mark this down or something

565
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:54,000
like that, or they're gonna add something or tweak something, and I don't really wanna

566
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:00,000
wait, or I'm gonna wait for, you know, a new stuff to come out.

567
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Or, you know, for the actual good games to come out.

568
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Just real quick, the GameCube launched with 12 games, and some of the highlights of those

569
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:15,000
12 games of what came out, Luigi's Mansion, Madden NFL 2002, Star Wars Rogue Squadron 2,

570
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Rogue Leader, I remember that being a really cool game, Super Monkey Ball, and Wave Race

571
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Bluestorm was probably, and see, see, there's nothing in there save maybe the Star Wars

572
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
game and maybe Luigi's Mansion or Wave Race, there's nothing that really like, jumps at

573
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
you, right?

574
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:34,000
But the GameCube, of course, was also pegged for not selling nearly as well as the 64 had.

575
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
So.

576
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Yeah.

577
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Maybe launch titles are way more important.

578
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
But I don't know, like, is the launch that important?

579
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,000
See, I sort of see this as Nintendo trying to set the stage for the holidays.

580
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I don't think Nintendo is really concerned with how this thing sells until the holidays.

581
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Yeah, I think that's correct, but at the same time, though, they've got to try to get

582
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
people, I mean, they don't want it to fail at any part.

583
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,000
You know, they may not be as concerned with the numbers not being quite where they want

584
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
them to be, but it is saying something, though, when your system's not selling out.

585
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,000
And it's not necessarily a bad thing, because it's good that people can find it when they

586
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
want it.

587
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
It's not like the WiiWare, it's just impossible to find.

588
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,000
But, it's, at the same time, it's, you look at what their release schedule is for the

589
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
3DS stuff, there's not a lot coming out.

590
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:30,000
I mean, it's pretty slim pickins for forever right now, because they haven't really announced

591
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
a lot of stuff.

592
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Okay, both GameGuru and Act F'd in our chatroom were chiming in saying Super Smash Brothers

593
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Melee was about three months after their release.

594
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Well, but, that's, three months later is still three months later, and, you know, who's to

595
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
say we're not going to get some of these big 3DS games three months later?

596
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,000
We're not, because they've already announced what the launch window stuff is, and that's

597
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
from Launch Window.

598
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
I love that, Launch Window.

599
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:58,000
I'm sorry, Launch Window may be the week that it comes out, or maybe the day it comes out.

600
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Not three months.

601
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,000
I don't call, you know, if you want to use that, let's say, okay, well, Xbox 360's had

602
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:08,000
a really awesome launch window this past five years, or six years.

603
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Yeah.

604
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,000
I really think you can't really judge this thing until the holidays, because I think,

605
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
you know, the Kid Icarus will obviously be out by the holidays.

606
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
It better be.

607
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I think Nintendo's going to have that stealth title that comes out at E3, which I don't

608
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
think is very stealth at all.

609
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,000
I'm pretty sure it's going to be Mario Brothers on the 3DS, and I think that'll be out by

610
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
the holidays.

611
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
That'll be New Super Mario Brothers 2, or something.

612
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
New Super Mario Brothers 3D, or something, you know.

613
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
That'll be their big thing that they come out and announce at the very end that's playable

614
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
on the show floor, because it's coming out this holiday.

615
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
They have some good stuff.

616
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
I mean, they have, like, well, actually...

617
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
And that thing's going to sell a shit ton of 3Ds.

618
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,000
And then by that time, you're going to be having 3D Netflix, you're going to be, you

619
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
know, I really think it's just so early to tell.

620
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:56,000
I don't think this system was really designed to have a huge launch.

621
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
So.

622
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
We'll see.

623
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
We'll see.

624
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Absolutely.

625
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
All right.

626
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Moving on to some more news.

627
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
This also has to do with handhelds and the tragedy and possibly the impact it had with

628
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
it.

629
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
The NGP.

630
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Now, there's been a lot of back and forth with this this week, so hear me out here.

631
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
The NGP might...

632
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
They were saying earlier in the week it might not have happened this year because of the

633
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
big earthquake that happened.

634
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:25,000
And there was a report where Jack Trenton, who is the Sony Computer Entertainment America

635
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:30,000
president talking to Bloomberg saying that Sony may have to launch the next generation

636
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,000
portable in just one market by the end of the year, which, you know, originally they

637
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
were going to be doing it everywhere.

638
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
And, of course, a lot of people said, well, that makes sense.

639
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
You know, it's really unfortunate what happened.

640
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
But yeah, that would probably be the case.

641
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
But then it came out a little later in the week.

642
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Wait a minute.

643
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Jack Trenton actually said they may have to delay the release of the next generation portable.

644
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:59,000
And the bosses in Japan, namely Satoshi Furuka, who is the representative of Sony Computer

645
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Entertainment over in Japan, said, so far we see no impact from the quake on our launch

646
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
plan, saying that the original Bloomberg report was wrong.

647
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Period.

648
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,000
So, it may not be delayed after all.

649
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Of course, this is one of those things where it's like, well, you don't really know until

650
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
E3.

651
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:22,000
So, if Sony products in the past or any history, it'll be out in Japan, then it'll be out in

652
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
the U.S. and Europe.

653
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
So, you're going to see some bit of a delay.

654
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:32,000
But, you know, I think you're going to see something where it comes out in Japan September,

655
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,000
October, and it comes out in the U.S. and Europe just in time for Black Friday here

656
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
in the U.S., like last week of November-ish.

657
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Sounds likely.

658
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:45,000
And by, you know, putting out rumors of delay, it probably just raised a little bit more

659
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
of the want.

660
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,000
So, I still feel like that we don't know enough about really what the system is going to bring

661
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
to the table.

662
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Yes, we had the press event before.

663
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
But, you know, a lot of stuff changes, too.

664
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:01,000
You know, and a lot of times, the things that they advertise don't really make the launch,

665
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
right?

666
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Going back into our last story a little bit, eh?

667
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
So, anyhow.

668
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:13,000
But with the PSP, though, I don't think there's really anything they announced that didn't

669
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
make the launch.

670
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
They just added stuff later on.

671
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Whereas Nintendo, oh yeah, all this stuff is, you know, going to be there.

672
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Oh yeah, but it's going to be, don't worry, it's coming out in the launch window.

673
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
It won't be long.

674
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
It'll just be a couple months.

675
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Launch window, my ass.

676
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Come on.

677
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Just say, listen, okay?

678
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
We put this out.

679
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
We wanted to get this out earlier.

680
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
You know, some of this stuff's not done, so.

681
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Still a lot of DS chitter chatter in our chat room.

682
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
ActDef saying the DS launch titles were pretty bad, too.

683
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:49,000
There were some pretty bad games at launch, but it also had the Mario 64 conversion, which

684
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,000
had a lot of people excited, because, you know, they had changed a few things with it,

685
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
made the extra characters or something.

686
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:00,000
So, I still remember Mario 64 being a pretty big deal when that first came out on the DS.

687
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
SSG100Matt says, there needs to be a buzz for when they go into the holidays.

688
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,000
If there is no buzz for it, then kids won't be begging their parents to buy it for them.

689
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
That's right.

690
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,000
UnfoldedRaptor says, what about Super Mario Sunshine or Star Fox Adventures?

691
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Again, both those games came way later, didn't they?

692
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Yeah.

693
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Especially Mario Sunshine was way later.

694
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
That was at least a year after.

695
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
So, those aren't even, you know.

696
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
And Star Fox Adventures, I think people like to forget about.

697
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Yeah, I don't think that was considered a big hit.

698
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:31,000
DDRAngel saying, I can't remember if Animal Crossing was a late release or not.

699
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
It was.

700
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Yeah.

701
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
I don't know if it was late, but it was more like mid.

702
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
It definitely wasn't early.

703
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,000
GameGuru says, besides the PlayStation 2's big title, Grand Theft Auto 3 came out a year

704
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
after the PlayStation 2's launch.

705
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Here's the thing, though.

706
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,000
The PlayStation 2 had a way different thing going for it at the time.

707
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
And the big thing was, it was a DVD player.

708
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
And that was right at the time when DVDs were starting to crack.

709
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:03,000
And a lot of people were buying PlayStation 2s because, hey, it plays DVDs and it can play games.

710
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
It's the same thing that Sony was hoping would sell the PlayStation 3.

711
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
It plays Blu-rays and games.

712
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
And, you know, now it's all about this.

713
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
It plays 3D Blu-rays as well.

714
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,000
In fact, you know, I don't know how many of you ran out and got Tron this week,

715
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
but some of the box sets, they have stickers right on them.

716
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Blu-ray also plays on PlayStation 3.

717
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,000
And it says right there on the back, to watch a Blu-ray 3D movie,

718
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,000
you will need a Blu-ray 3D player or a PlayStation 3.

719
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:36,000
So, you know, they're really setting up a PlayStation 3 as, like, you know, not just a game machine.

720
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,000
And that was the same deal with the PlayStation 2 and why it sold very well.

721
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:46,000
And it is a really good Blu-ray player because it's one that keeps itself up to date with, you know, over the networks.

722
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,000
And, yeah, you can with normal, like, Blu-ray players as well,

723
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,000
but it's a little more cumbersome than just an automatic update.

724
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:57,000
I don't know, it's just, it's good for that.

725
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:01,000
I mean, I use it for a Blu-ray player more than I use it for a game system.

726
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Remember all the shit that people gave Xbox to when it came out because it did not play DVDs?

727
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Unless you bought a $50 remote, the DVD playback kit.

728
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Yeah.

729
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Yeah.

730
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,000
I think a lot of people forgot how horrible that went over.

731
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Anyhow, let's move on with some more gaming news.

732
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?

733
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
I'm completely mesmerized by the sexiness.

734
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
What's that?

735
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Well, it's a game coming out called Galaga Legion's DX.

736
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Ooh, I want to take a look at this too.

737
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Uh, they-

738
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Are you playing the video?

739
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Yes, I'm looking at the video too. I want to see this here.

740
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Ah, pretty.

741
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:48,000
It's basically, um, tons and tons and tons of the, the Galaga Armada going against you.

742
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
You have to shoot lots and lots and lots and lots of them.

743
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,000
This isn't bullet hell, this is ship hell.

744
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,000
And it's done by the same, uh, people who did Pac-Man Championship Edition.

745
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
So, very cool.

746
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:07,000
It's got a new feature called Focus Fire, where it gives you, um, control for secondary aiming.

747
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
And, uh, it looks like it's pretty awesome.

748
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
It's got lots of pretty colors and swirlies and things.

749
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Yeah, it almost looks like it's like, I don't know, like, Galaga meets Geometry Wars meets-

750
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Res or some type of Q Entertainment game?

751
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Is pretty.

752
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Do want.

753
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
There's the Focus Fire option.

754
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Interesting.

755
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:35,000
But it looks like one of the things is you sort of cut through them like you're making a path.

756
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:42,000
And then can, uh, sort of send out something that would destroy, like, them en masse.

757
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
So it looks pretty cool.

758
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Very neat.

759
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:49,000
And I can, um, link the, uh, YouTube video in the chatroom.

760
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Very cool.

761
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:55,000
I'm glad to see the Pac-Man Championship Edition team is kind of continuing forward with reimagining some other titles.

762
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:00,000
This looks a little weird, but I would definitely check out, you know, like a demo at least to see if it's something I would be into.

763
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
But, you know, I love Pac-Man Championship Edition.

764
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,000
And even the reimagined one, you know, they put out the second one not that long ago.

765
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
It's great too.

766
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
So, uh, that's a good team.

767
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Reimagining some of the classics.

768
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
I wonder what other Namco classics they should revisit.

769
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
I think we should get, like, Dig Dug Hardcore.

770
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Ah, that would be crazy.

771
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,000
I don't even know how that would work, but it just, in my head, it's really funny.

772
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:29,000
But it also looks like you get another one where you can get all sorts of, uh, you know how you can get your bonus ship when it takes the ship and you free it?

773
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Mm-hmm.

774
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,000
It looks like you have an option similar to that, except it's got a bunch of bonus ships.

775
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:39,000
So, but it's gonna be, um, on Xbox 360 and PS3.

776
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Of course.

777
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Alright. Awesome.

778
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Let's move on.

779
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Loki.

780
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Yeah.

781
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Um, so there's, uh, some new announcements made by EA regarding their, uh, basketball franchises.

782
00:36:52,000 --> 00:37:02,000
You may remember NBA Elite 11, uh, got cancelled last year, uh, when it was apparently revealed that it's crap.

783
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Um, so they didn't release it.

784
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Well, a few leaked out, but they didn't release it.

785
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Um, well, the next simulation basketball game won't be coming this year.

786
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:18,000
It'll actually be next year, um, in fall of 2012 is when you can expect the next EA game.

787
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
They're really going back to the drawing board with that stuff.

788
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:28,000
So, um, they're saying, you know, we have top talent on the game and we're giving the new development team time to deliver a superior experience.

789
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:33,000
We're making great strides and looking forward to launching a new game next year.

790
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:43,000
And it says, uh, that lesson's, uh, that lesson about giving the team plenty of time was learned the hard way through the near release and scrapping of NBA 11.

791
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:58,000
And then, of course, uh, to fill the void for not having a new NBA, you know, simulation game, there is the NBA Jam On Fire edition that's coming to PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade this October.

792
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:04,000
And apparently it is a follow-up, of course, to NBA Jam that was released last year.

793
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Um, and then it's going download only just like it was originally supposed to, uh, with the release of NBA Elite 11.

794
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,000
It was supposed to be a pack-in bonus, I guess, if you bought the game.

795
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:31,000
The On Fire edition will be getting, uh, new opponent AI, uh, revamped visuals, and I guess a host of new online features as well as an online, uh, road trip campaign mode and roster updates.

796
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:38,000
And, um, apparently the new AI's, um, gonna learn your tendencies and throw them back in your face.

797
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:48,000
And, uh, apparently the game will be $15 to $20, not $50 like it was released last year.

798
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:53,000
And really, if you ask me, it was way too expensive for a game that was originally gonna be free.

799
00:38:53,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Exactly. And that, I didn't even really think of this in terms of, oh, EA needs a basketball game this year since their other one's gonna get delayed till next year.

800
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Um, now I always thought this was kind of like, oh, I guess NBA Jam didn't really do well, so this is their way to try to make money from it by delivering it the way everybody said they thought it should have been in the first place.

801
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:26,000
It's very interesting because this whole value of a game thing has been a big theme the past year or so, you know, or at least especially since Game Developers Conference this year where they were, you know, talking about it.

802
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Uh, you know, when they were kind of getting into that whole argument about, um, the Angry Birds developer sells their game for 99 cents, Nintendo says it devalues games as a whole, blah, blah, blah, blah.

803
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:47,000
It's very interesting where the public is kind of setting the bar for some things. Like, you talk to a lot of people and everybody's like, $50, $60, way too much to pay for NBA Jam, but I pay $15 for it.

804
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
It's like, how do you value a game? How do you price a game?

805
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:58,000
I think the reason why that they're willing to pay $15 or $20 for the game is because it was originally announced that it was going to be an Xbox Live Arcade game.

806
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:14,000
So, what that sounds like when, you know, the consumer hears, okay, it was going to be a packing game that was going to be released on Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network later on after NBA Elite comes out and you can purchase that separately if you didn't buy NBA Elite, you know, for $15 to $20.

807
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Oh, but now NBA Elite gets cancelled and now it's a $50 game because they're claiming that they added some other stuff in.

808
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Well, I'm sorry, but what did they add in that raised the price up $30? Because I can tell you this much, I've seen the Xbox Live Arcade game, back out on PartnerNet, and they didn't add much.

809
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Definitely not $30 much. So, that's a load of bullshit right there and the fact that they're now re- I would call it a re-release, okay, so they're tweaking it a little bit and then selling it to you again.

810
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Well, if you think about it, that is EA for you. They tweak things a little bit and then they sell it to you again. That's their sports games franchises.

811
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:04,000
I mean, I don't know, it's whatever. I mean, if you're going to buy it, cool. Honestly, last NBA Jam game didn't look that great.

812
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:11,000
I mean, it looked all- I guess it was alright, but I did without it and I can do without this next one.

813
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:18,000
But, good news I guess for 2K, at least they get another year where they have no competition whatsoever.

814
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:28,000
And there's other developers out there that are kind of taking the whole pricing structure thing and turning it on its nose, like THQ is trying with MX vs ATV Alive.

815
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,000
They're putting out the game for $40 new and then they're going to support it with download content.

816
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:41,000
And they're saying that's the way they're going to do things. They're going to keep adding download content on a regular basis and then make additional money that way.

817
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Which is fine as long as it's actually new content and not just crap that they're just removed out of the game and then added back in later on.

818
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Or like, God, I can't wait for that role-playing game to come out that costs $40.

819
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:58,000
But to beat the final boss, you need the final boss pack, which you can download for $20 on Xbox Live.

820
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Or to finish the story, you need the epilogue pack. You know what I mean?

821
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Yeah.

822
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:11,000
I'd be a little worried about that. Alright, we'll see what happens when this game's released. If it goes over as well as everybody thinks, it will.

823
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Anyhow, moving on to news about Sonic the Hedgehog.

824
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Apparently, there is a new Sonic the Hedgehog game on its way out. It's coming out for the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3.

825
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,000
This was announced via Sonic's Facebook page.

826
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:30,000
There was a little teaser trailer released where Sonic is running through little colored sequences of loops and so forth.

827
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Classic Sonic is back in the game. Let's take a look. Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in 2011.

828
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Taking a look here at the, excuse me, the little teaser video here in studio.

829
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Let's see if we can get it to load.

830
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Sega!

831
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Of course. Every Sega game has to load.

832
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,000
I'm curious if Arasaka's got this because I know she's a big Sonic fangirl.

833
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Oh yeah, watch this.

834
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:03,000
The graphics look pretty cool. Like, it's in high depth. Very well rendered.

835
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Running through ramps and ice.

836
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
I think that's just a trailer.

837
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Oh yeah, this is just a trailer. Yeah, of course, I'm sure it's pre-rendered, but...

838
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,000
It's weird to me how they do this whole, like, two Sonic thing.

839
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
It's new Sonic and classic Sonic.

840
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Yeah. It's still a little weird.

841
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
It doesn't really tell me enough about the game, so...

842
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,000
I'm sure we'll be seeing more about it at E3, but you know what the first thing that went through my head was?

843
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Whatever happened to Sonic the Hedgehog 4 Part 2? Remember how they had that Sonic the Hedgehog 4 Part 1?

844
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Somebody linked me to a story earlier because I said the same thing on Bobby's show and I got a link to a story where I guess they say it is still in development.

845
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
As late as late February they were saying that the game is still in development, but...

846
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
How do we make it not suck?

847
00:43:51,000 --> 00:44:00,000
I know, I'm kinda sitting here going, well, usually when you have an episodic game, you plan on releasing one episode a month, not one episode a year, you know?

848
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Oh, weird.

849
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Yeah, very odd.

850
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
What they're doing.

851
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:10,000
So, I guess there's still a Sonic the Hedgehog 4 Part 2 coming as well, but I'm also required to care about this.

852
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:16,000
But we'll see when there's some actual gameplay footage to come out, hopefully around E3. We'll see about that, though.

853
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Yeah, but here's my question with the whole Sonic the Hedgehog 4 stuff, is who really cares?

854
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Because the reviews on it weren't that great, and most of the industry reviewers and the user reviews have been pretty terrible, so who cares?

855
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:44,000
I mean, that's gotta suck when you're like, okay, I gotta put out a bunch of episodes now for a game that no one gives a shit about. Damn.

856
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Um, you know, it's also one of the things where I feel like they're always trying to reboot Sonic. Like, let's just reboot Sonic.

857
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Oh, we should try rebooting Sonic again. It's like Sega's perennial answer. Maybe it's time to retire, Sonic.

858
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Hate to go there, but I don't know, Sonic games have been very, very hip to us lately.

859
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:12,000
It's not that difficult to fix Sonic. You make it like it was before. The old Sonic. Don't try to add werewolves into it. Don't try to make it all weird.

860
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Don't give him a sword. You know, just make it Sonic. Now, I know that you tried that with Sonic the Hedgehog 4, and it failed terribly, but you know what?

861
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:35,000
We can only help you so far, so just make it like that, but not suck. That's all you gotta do.

862
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Alright, let's move on with another story here before we get into the release dates where we travel around the world and see what's coming out soon. DarkSakura?

863
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Well, actually, PopCap has decided to make a new label called 4th & Battery, and you can actually check this out at 4thandbattery.com.

864
00:45:51,000 --> 00:46:06,000
As all one word, number 4thandbattery.com. It is a new label to bring out experimental ideas to customer so they can be more creative, get stuff out that's a little bit, as they say, off the beaten path.

865
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:16,000
So, it's pretty cool, and looks like the first thing out is gonna be called Unpleasant Horse. And watching the trailer for this, it's very silly.

866
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
This horse is definitely not feeling pleasant.

867
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:28,000
You start off with a bird and a pegasus, and everything's happy, and then here comes a dark horse with a little skull on its butt like the evil My Little Pony.

868
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,000
This horse is just at the Chinese buffet, and now it's feeling very unpleasant.

869
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Pooping lightning.

870
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:43,000
It makes me think, though, of the bad horse from Dr. Horrible. But yeah, it looks pretty interesting. Apparently, this was an idea they had before 4th and Battery came out.

871
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:50,000
But, um, they're calling this, uh, and I quote, it's a sandbox for PopCap's inner child.

872
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Well, I'm playing some of the audio here in the studio.

873
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Aw, it's a little birdie. No horse.

874
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:03,000
This definitely doesn't look like other PopCap games. You're like, where's the jewels to switch? Or, you know.

875
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,000
He farted lightning.

876
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:12,000
It's like a bad horse.

877
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Random hard rock.

878
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:22,000
I hope it's gonna be fun. I mean, PopCap puts out, you know, pretty high quality stuff.

879
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:30,000
It was something that I thought that it got rejected because of some sort of, like, throwing horses through meat grinders or something like that.

880
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Just, like, weird, weird stuff.

881
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Sounds a little bit like Super Meat Boy, if that's the case.

882
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Well, I think it was only rejected because they said it was, they classified it as, like, a family game, but it, you know, not a family game.

883
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Horses going through meat grinders are probably not very family friendly.

884
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Depends what kind of family you have.

885
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:54,000
I just like in this interview on the page, it says, much like Honey Badger, unpleasant horse just don't give a shit.

886
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
I'm glad for the reference to Honey Badger.

887
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Yes, I love Honey Badger.

888
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:05,000
And unpleasant horse, his name is Bubbles. And is female.

889
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Bubbles?

890
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,000
I'm looking through the interview. Her name is Bubbles.

891
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Sorry, I just have to look at this a little bit here.

892
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,000
This is the Honey Badger. Watch it run in slow motion.

893
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:20,000
It's pretty badass. Look, it runs all over the place.

894
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Whoa, watch out, says that bird. Ew, it's got a snake. Oh, it's chasing a jackal. Oh my gosh.

895
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Oh, the Honey Badgers are just crazy.

896
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:35,000
The Honey Badger has been referred to by the Guinness Book of World Records as the most fearless animal in all of the animal kingdom.

897
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
It really doesn't give a shit.

898
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:44,000
I love that they brought Charles Nelson Reilly back from the grave to narrate that video.

899
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Anyhow, the over 30 listeners will understand that joke.

900
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Alright, let's move on. Let's travel the world and look at some release dates and what's coming out to a video game store near you.

901
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Charles Nelson Reilly, rise from your grave.

902
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Yeah, that'd be awesome.

903
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Now this week, there's a few things coming out.

904
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Actually, today there was a couple 3DS games. Rabbids Travel in Time for 3DS.

905
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:11,000
I'll have you know this is one of the reasons why people aren't picking up games on the 3DS,

906
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:16,000
because this game is just a port of the one that was on the DS, now with some 3D in it.

907
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell for the 3DS looked like a game that was made for the DS.

908
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,000
That's also out on the 3DS this week.

909
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Spongebob Squiggle Pants for uDraw.

910
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:32,000
It's kind of like WarioWare, but it requires the THQ uDraw tablet.

911
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:36,000
So, WarioWare for like Mario Paint.

912
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,000
That's out on the Wii.

913
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:44,000
A re-release of Attack of the Movies 3D, bundled with four blaster controllers.

914
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Trying to hit up the budget game market there.

915
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
That's on the Wii.

916
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Lego Battle Ninja Go on the Nintendo DS.

917
00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Karaoke Revolution Glee being re-released to put the game by itself without the microphones.

918
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
That's coming out this week.

919
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,000
As well as, I believe, let's see here.

920
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Oh, Fantastic Pets.

921
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,000
This is a game from THQ.

922
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:17,000
It's supposed to kind of cash in on that wonderful franchise created by Connectamals.

923
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Except, you know, instead of raising tigers and whatnot, you get to raise unicorns and lizards that turn into dragons and cats that turn into purple cats.

924
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:35,000
That's on the 360 for Kinect.

925
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Dance Dance Revolution.

926
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Might have forgotten about that game for the other systems.

927
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Now it's finally coming out on 360.

928
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
The bundle for 40 bucks.

929
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
That's a great price for the bundle.

930
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Elements of War on PC.

931
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Trackmania Turbo Build to Race on the Nintendo DS.

932
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Divinity II the Dragon Knight Saga.

933
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Kind of a redone version of Divinity II for Xbox 360 being released this week.

934
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Rio, the game tie-in for the upcoming animated movie.

935
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Coming out on DS, Xbox 360, Playstation 3, and Wii.

936
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Squinkies.

937
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:23,000
This is what Activision's decided to spend their time on.

938
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:30,000
It is like those little toys that you find in the 25 cent bubble machines or whatever.

939
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Yeah, something I don't understand.

940
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
That's coming out on DS.

941
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,000
And Potapon 3 on PSP this week.

942
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Michael Jackson the Experience coming out on Xbox 360 and Playstation 3.

943
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Are you going to buy that?

944
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,000
You know what, actually I am looking forward to picking it up on 360.

945
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
So I will check that out.

946
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,000
What is it about the Michael Jackson experience that you're looking forward to?

947
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Oh, I just like the dancing games.

948
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Did you ever buy that one dancing game that came out?

949
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:02,000
It's not Dance Masters, it's not Dance Central.

950
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Dance Paradise? Is that what it's called?

951
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,000
No.

952
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Really? I was looking at it.

953
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
No, it looked terrible.

954
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
I got it and then I put it back on the shelf.

955
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Yeah, it looks terrible.

956
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
But it has Lady Gaga!

957
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
That doesn't make me buy things though, Rob.

958
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
It makes me buy things.

959
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:19,000
It just looked terrible.

960
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:25,000
And then let's see what else we've got here.

961
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Not much else really this week.

962
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:33,000
I was looking, I actually saw some of these things that made me kind of scratch my head.

963
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,000
They had like this Rocco game capture device.

964
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:40,000
It didn't really say what resolution it captured in it, so I could not buy that.

965
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Yeah, that's pretty much it.

966
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,000
Pretty much it for this week.

967
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Good stuff though in two weeks though.

968
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Mortal Kombat and Portal 2.

969
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
I know, it's a big week.

970
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Squeeze.

971
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Damn, there went all my money.

972
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,000
Lots of Squeeze.

973
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,000
It's going to be a shopping spree at Fry's.

974
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,000
I'm still looking forward to hearing that.

975
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,000
And a shopping Squeeze.

976
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Alright, moving on to Japan. Let's see what you can Squeeze about for the release dates over there.

977
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Cross Channel in memory of all people coming out on the Xbox 360 as well as Homefront.

978
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Both getting their Japanese releases this week.

979
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Lost Planet 2 moves into the Platinum Collection this week over there as well.

980
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Trying to look up this Cross Channel in memory of all people and see what this is about.

981
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
I want to see if this is a game that's out over here.

982
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:29,000
It's from Cyberfront and I'm not seeing a whole lot with it except a scene where the characters are in swimsuits.

983
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,000
So this is definitely some type of anime.

984
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:36,000
It's one of those anime games that's just not going to come over here because we don't get games like that here.

985
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Interactive stories is what they look like to me.

986
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Why don't we have, and this is a total random topic here, why don't we have like a telenovela game?

987
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Because that would be just so random.

988
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,000
A Telemundo game?

989
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Yes, a Telemundo game.

990
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Sabado Higante the game.

991
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
A bunch of little mini games on the Wii.

992
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
It would be different.

993
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
There's been nothing.

994
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
It would be awesome.

995
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:05,000
I would like to see them go back and take the old Sentos franchises.

996
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,000
The Mexican wrestler superhero.

997
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,000
That would be awesome.

998
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Well they did have the Mexican wrestling game.

999
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Yeah, and it sucked.

1000
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:16,000
But I'm talking about something ridiculous.

1001
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Like Italian Spiderman.

1002
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Even though that's not real.

1003
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:26,000
It would still be awesome to take that fake character and make an Italian Spiderman game.

1004
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:33,000
I'm trying to see what type of shows are on Telemundo these days that they could make a show out of.

1005
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Of course this thing is trying to...

1006
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Let's see, what are the...

1007
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
I don't know what the big shows on Telemundo are.

1008
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
I don't really watch it.

1009
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
There's Shakira.

1010
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Alright, this is a terrible segment. Let me move on with the releases.

1011
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
PlayStation 3.

1012
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Lost Planet 2 also gets a price reduction there.

1013
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Homefront comes out on there as well.

1014
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,000
There's also a game called Pro Yaku Spirits 2011.

1015
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Baseball.

1016
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
From Konami. Yep, it's a baseball sim.

1017
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Trying to see...

1018
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,000
It looked, from the cover for a minute, it looked like it was kind of like chibi basketball.

1019
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
But no, this is like real-deal Japanese...

1020
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
I'm sorry, basketball.

1021
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Japanese baseball.

1022
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
So this is Japanese baseball.

1023
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Actually it looks really good.

1024
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Yeah.

1025
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
I have a friend on LiveJournal who will be really into that.

1026
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
She loves her Japanese baseball.

1027
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Let's see, also coming out, WRC Fia World Rally Championship.

1028
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
That's a racing game if you didn't know.

1029
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,000
From Deep Silver.

1030
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Moving on to the Nintendo Wii.

1031
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Trying to see if they have anything coming out on there this week.

1032
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,000
They don't.

1033
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
But next week you can get Billy's Bootcamp.

1034
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Wii Day Enjoy Diet.

1035
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Yet another game there.

1036
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Coming out this week on the 3DS in Japan.

1037
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Pilotwings Resort.

1038
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
They didn't get it at launch, but they're getting it now.

1039
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Pilotwings Resort comes out this week in Japan.

1040
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Also Pro Yaku Spirits 2011, so the baseball sim comes out on the 3DS this week as well.

1041
00:55:54,000 --> 00:56:00,000
And lastly on the PSP this week, we have Last Rancor gets a price reduction.

1042
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:06,000
We have Dai Tu Zhi Super Robot Taisen Zee Hakai Hen comes out this week as well.

1043
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
That's Robot Wars series.

1044
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,000
And that's coming out.

1045
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:13,000
It's a strategy game on the PSP if you like those games.

1046
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:18,000
And lastly, Persona 2 Sumi, Innocent Sin comes out this week.

1047
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:23,000
So if you're a fan of the Persona series, I think this is like a spinoff series that's on the portable.

1048
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
It might be like a remake or something.

1049
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
Yeah, that's available this week on the PSP.

1050
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,000
So check it out.

1051
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Sounds fun.

1052
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,000
Well we have just a few things coming out in Europe.

1053
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:37,000
On 12th we have World of Tanks for the PC.

1054
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:42,000
On the 15th, Lego Ninja Go, the video game on the DS.

1055
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:46,000
And also Michael Jackson, the experience on PS3 and Xbox 360.

1056
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:50,000
They don't get the Mortal Kombat joy until after we do.

1057
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
So, just saying.

1058
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Those poor guys always have to wait.

1059
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Portal 2 is out on my birthday, hint, hint.

1060
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Everybody.

1061
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,000
I have a Steam account.

1062
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Alright.

1063
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:07,000
I want to get the PlayStation 3 one so I get the PS3 game and the Steam game, right?

1064
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
I have a PS3.

1065
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
That's what I plan to do.

1066
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Alright, moving on.

1067
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:18,000
So this week, a hacking group named Anonymous.

1068
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:22,000
Oh, I had a feeling it was Anonymous.

1069
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Yeah.

1070
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Anonymous.

1071
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:35,000
They are now apparently, I guess, battling Sony now because they're saying,

1072
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:43,000
We are currently investigating including the possibility of targeted behavior from an outside party.

1073
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Yes, they were getting hacked.

1074
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
They already said.

1075
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Apparently, the group said they declare loyalty to GeoHot and Raph Chocolo.

1076
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:06,000
Two hackers, well, GeoHot, obviously, the one, has the keys that people want.

1077
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:11,000
Release some of them so that people can actually start doing homebrew stuff.

1078
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:18,000
And Raph Chocolo was behind bringing Linux back to the PS3 and he's a big part of that.

1079
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:22,000
In fact, he's still actually doing hacking stuff based on that.

1080
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Basically, they're saying they're attacking Sony's private property because we disagree with their actions.

1081
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:39,000
And they're going to keep on doing that.

1082
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:46,000
So they were attacking the PlayStation Network and Sony's websites and stuff like that.

1083
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Of course, I guess, they realize that attacking the PlayStation Network kind of hurts the people that they're trying to fight for.

1084
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:59,000
So they're saying, OK, we decided that we're not going to attack the PlayStation Network at this time,

1085
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:06,000
but they're going to find different ways to attack Sony, I guess.

1086
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:13,000
One of them being that they're going to, I guess, reveal a bunch of information about Sony's upper management,

1087
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:27,000
including crazy stuff like all their personal information, email addresses, addresses, phone numbers, pictures of their family, where they live, all sorts of crazy stuff.

1088
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:30,000
See, some of that stuff gets a little cray cray.

1089
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:40,000
The DOS attack is one thing, but the whole pictures of family, when you start involving kids, I don't think anybody's comfortable with that.

1090
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:44,000
But then you've got to wonder, maybe that's just a smear campaign. I don't know.

1091
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:47,000
The whole point is just to make them feel uncomfortable, I think.

1092
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Anonymous, I mean, I'm going to plead a little bit ignorance here because I don't really fully understand what's going on there.

1093
00:59:54,000 --> 01:00:02,000
I know it's a big group. I know there's a lot of people. I know about the in-person stuff they do with Scientology, and I know it's kind of a spin off of 4chan.

1094
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:06,000
I love the logo. The logo is fucking awesome.

1095
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:10,000
So nobody's really in charge there because it's Anonymous?

1096
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,000
No, no one's really in charge.

1097
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
They actually grew on 4chan.

1098
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:17,000
So it's like a Borg thing. It's a group collective, right?

1099
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Is that how it works?

1100
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
I'm sure there's people behind it, but...

1101
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:24,000
It all runs on groupthink? Because it's...

1102
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:41,000
Surely somebody in Anonymous says, dude, pictures of families, not okay. It's one thing to order illegitimate pizzas and send them to Sony headquarters, but when you start posting pictures of people's kids, that's too much.

1103
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:48,000
And then... Sony, Sony, Sony.

1104
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:59,000
And this is the thing too, especially with any kind of radical type group, it's that if they don't follow through on the threat, no one's going to take them seriously.

1105
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:04,000
Oh, they won't do that. But the thing is, I'm pretty damn sure they will.

1106
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:18,000
And it's that sort of, I hate to put it this way, but sort of like integrity, if you know what I mean? The fact that if they say they're going to do it, they're going to do it.

1107
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:23,000
That gets people, you know, listening to them.

1108
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Well, the other thing they were too pissed off about was the fact that Sony was collecting the IP addresses for everybody that visited GeoHot's site.

1109
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Well, that was ridiculous.

1110
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:42,000
And they're saying, no, if you do anything with that, you go after anybody, you're going to have hell to pay.

1111
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:49,000
So, the other thing is, okay, I don't understand these companies.

1112
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Basically, Sony hired this outside company to help protect them during this DDOS attack.

1113
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:09,000
So, they have the hosting provider for Sony, they're belittling Anonymous' cyber attack, calling it medium strength, and something that's only annoyed our network engineers.

1114
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:16,000
Why would you say something like that? That's just going to piss them off and make them try harder.

1115
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Do people not learn? Oh, our system's unhackable! It's the most secure system ever!

1116
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Oh, your attack was pathetic! I've seen worse from my ground!

1117
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:31,000
It's like, seriously, why would you do that?

1118
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
Yeah, I'm kind of surprised they acknowledged it at all.

1119
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:38,000
It's like, oh great, thank you dumbass that had to open your mouth. Now you're going to...

1120
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:44,000
It's just going to piss them off. That's all you're doing. You're just going to piss them off now.

1121
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Great. Can't wait to see what happens this week.

1122
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
Piss who off?

1123
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:54,000
See, that's just the part, you know...

1124
01:02:54,000 --> 01:03:06,000
I don't know. There's definitely got to be a lot of varying opinions within that group, such as like, how far do you go?

1125
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:12,000
So, you know. I don't know. We'll see what happens.

1126
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Well, we know what this one guy did. There's one individual that did something in it. Had to do a little bit with hacking and so forth.

1127
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:24,000
It has to do with Xbox. Since we talked about Sony, let's talk about Xbox.

1128
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:29,000
This was an Xbox Live user who'd been banned from the service over 35 times.

1129
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:35,000
He went out and did some bad things to Steven Toulouse. I think I'm saying that right. It might be Toulouse.

1130
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:43,000
Sorry if I'm saying that wrong. But he's one of the executives and this guy is big up on Xbox Live. Like, he's pretty much the head of Xbox Live.

1131
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:47,000
And this guy actually ended up essentially hacking the Xbox Live account.

1132
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:51,000
But I want to point out, he didn't hack through Xbox Live.

1133
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:57,000
He hacked the computer that sent the email for the password reset to get to the Xbox Live account.

1134
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:00,000
So, you know, your Xbox Live account is fine for now.

1135
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:04,000
This guy did this to kind of get his point across.

1136
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Obviously, the guy is the director of policy and enforcement for Xbox Live. So, it's not like he couldn't get his own account back.

1137
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:16,000
The hacker is named Predator and he basically made a whole little boasting thing on YouTube.

1138
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:24,000
And, I don't know, it was kind of like talking a lot about how he's doing them a favor and so forth. I don't know. Kind of weird.

1139
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:28,000
I think he's trying to be one of those hackers that really wants to get hired by the company.

1140
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
But I don't know if that's really the best way to go about doing it.

1141
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:34,000
But you know how companies will hire hackers to help improve the integrity of the system?

1142
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:38,000
I think maybe that's what this guy is trying to do, but he's going about it the wrong way.

1143
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:43,000
Especially if you get banned from Xbox Live 35 times, you're probably just a dick, dude.

1144
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
It means they probably don't want to deal with you at all.

1145
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:49,000
Yeah. So, this probably wasn't the best way to get your point across.

1146
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:53,000
Maybe a nice little heartfelt, I'm sorry. Be better. I don't know.

1147
01:04:53,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Alright, anyhow, we're going to now walk through Classic Game Archives and... what's that?

1148
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,000
You should start with the old music first.

1149
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Okay, yeah. The Classic Game of the Week is the next segment. Thank you for totally derailing me.

1150
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
Sorry!

1151
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:16,000
Every week on the show we have a segment where DarkSakura looks in the Classic Gaming vault and picks out one game that she says,

1152
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:21,000
Hey! You kids ought to be checking this out this week. It's the Classic Game of the Week.

1153
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,000
DarkSakura, what is the Classic Game of the Week?

1154
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:27,000
It's actually two games. It's Killer Instinct, both one and two, because I had to put them together.

1155
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
Alright.

1156
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
But the first one's really the best.

1157
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:36,000
Let's check out some of this music. The ambience from Killer Instinct 1.

1158
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:41,000
This used to be my favorite music in the game, was killer music.

1159
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:49,000
Anyway, Killer Instinct was developed by Rare and published by Midway and Nintendo and was in the arcades in 1994.

1160
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:54,000
And it was rumored to use the Ultra 64 hardware engine.

1161
01:05:54,000 --> 01:06:02,000
In fact, there was actually this teaser for it being on Nintendo Ultra 64, if anyone remembers that.

1162
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:07,000
But this game had a pretty unique system for it.

1163
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:15,000
It had some moves that were very similar to how Street Fighter worked, but also had Mortal Kombat style finishing moves.

1164
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:24,000
And a few other kind of neat things. It had a double energy bar, so that instead of winning two rounds, you actually just had two bars of energy.

1165
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:29,000
When you finished one up, the fight would pause and your new bar would fill up, so that's how it worked.

1166
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:34,000
You had combos that if you pressed the buttons in a certain order, they would just auto combo.

1167
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:43,000
And then you had your finishers that are called No Mercy, although other versions called it a danger move.

1168
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:49,000
And it was basically, you know, violent finishers, like an orchid would flash your boobs and the other person would die of a heart attack.

1169
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Unless it was another orchid, then she'd just stomp her feet and be jealous. That was cute.

1170
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:59,000
And then you also had humiliations where it would make people dance, and they had different dance styles.

1171
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:06,000
You had the Ultra combo that was, basically they'd just go into this huge ass auto combo.

1172
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:13,000
But with some of the characters you could actually keep re-juggling with extra hits at the end of the combo, so you could get over 80 hits.

1173
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:17,000
I was always really good at the 44 hit combo with orchid.

1174
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:29,000
Anyway, you also had combo breakers where if you either hit in the double digits or were in the combo link stage, you could do this little move and it would break the combo.

1175
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:38,000
A combo breaker! Anyway, so it was pretty neat. You also could do these advanced moves right after you did a combo breaker.

1176
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:42,000
Like, Jago for example would have a red fireball instead of the green one.

1177
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:49,000
So your characters in the first one were Fulgore, Cinder, Glaceous, Jago, Riptor, Saberwolf, Spinal, who was actually the second to last.

1178
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:54,000
No, the third to- the second to last. Because I think Fulgore was after him and then it was idle.

1179
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:59,000
Anyway, TJ combo, Chief Thunder, orchid, well it says B orchid I guess it's supposed to be black orchid, and idle.

1180
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Who didn't have any special moves at all, except he could refill his life by stomping on the ground.

1181
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:11,000
It was also the first arcade game that had an internal hard drive.

1182
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:16,000
And the game was actually done in pre-rendered sprites that was done by Silicon Graphics.

1183
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:23,000
And the backgrounds were pre-rendered as a movie, but the frames would adjust based on where the characters were.

1184
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:31,000
So it was pretty cool. It also used the R4600 processor. It's pretty cool.

1185
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
And, oh you film?

1186
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:36,000
I'm just jumping to random ones, playing a little bit before you get to the second game.

1187
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:40,000
There was a SNES version, it had a lot of stuff cut out and way panned out.

1188
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:48,000
But it came with Killer Cuts, which was a 16 track remix version of all the songs.

1189
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:54,000
And you could actually order it through Nintendo Power, or you could get the CD if you bought the game.

1190
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
I got mine because I bought the game.

1191
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:04,000
And it was in a black case. There was a Game Boy version, but if you played it on the Super Game Boy, it had actually limited color added to it.

1192
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:09,000
And you could play it two player, and they actually really toned down a lot of the characters' moves.

1193
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:17,000
For the Nintendo 64, there was not a Killer Instinct or Killer Instinct 2, but you had Killer Instinct Gold that was based off of Killer Instinct 2.

1194
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:23,000
And that leads us to Killer Instinct 2! Yay!

1195
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
How about some new music, Rob?

1196
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,000
Working on it.

1197
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
Okay.

1198
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:33,000
Killer Instinct 2 is the sequel, and they changed moves.

1199
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
Annoying.

1200
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
Which one is this?

1201
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
Working.

1202
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:45,000
Yeah, that was the CD version.

1203
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:54,000
But it was really cool. This was my favorite music in the game.

1204
01:09:54,000 --> 01:10:01,000
Now, I'll tell you, when Dan got Killer Instinct Gold, I had him, because you had to keep starting the game over to get the right music.

1205
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:06,000
And he actually recorded an MP3 of this for me, because I wanted it that badly.

1206
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,000
I was a big nerd.

1207
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:11,000
This is when we were first friends on the interwebs.

1208
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:27,000
But KI2 basically had similar control, and it had the whole life bar thing the way that Killer Instinct was.

1209
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:32,000
And I had auto combos, but they changed a few things.

1210
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:41,000
Some of the normal moves, though, were toned down, and then you also had different blocking moves that were thrown in.

1211
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
You also had throws, too.

1212
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:48,000
And then there were ways to glitch a combo and do different moves along with that.

1213
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:56,000
It basically had sort of a rock-paper-scissors system with how certain moves could be tied to certain moves.

1214
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
And it was really bizarre.

1215
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:01,000
Killer Instinct 2, for me, was a lot harder of a game.

1216
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:05,000
And then you had a super bar where you could fill it up when you take damage.

1217
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:11,000
And then you could do a huge super move, which was an extended version of the regular move.

1218
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:21,000
And it had actually a parry system, so you could counter-attack after a block, and all kinds of different stuff.

1219
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:27,000
It was new finishing moves, all kinds of new stuff, and no humiliations, though.

1220
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:30,000
But every character had two ultimate combos.

1221
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
And you could still do ultra combos.

1222
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:40,000
So, with the characters in this one, the ones that came back were Full Gore-Jago's final TJ combo, Glaceous Saberwolf, and Orchid.

1223
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:43,000
And all of her moves changed. It was so weird.

1224
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:47,000
And then the new characters were Maya, who was the one that I used the most.

1225
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:51,000
And according to Nintendo Power, she was the worst dress of 1996.

1226
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
She had nice boobies.

1227
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:56,000
And Tusk, who was, like, her dude.

1228
01:11:56,000 --> 01:12:03,000
Kim Wu, who was actually pretty fun. And Gargos, who was a demon lord, who was the rival of Eidol.

1229
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:06,000
Ooh. And you could only use him with a cheat code.

1230
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:12,000
So, they had different endings based on how you beat the game.

1231
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:21,000
So, like, Jago's was different based on if he kills Orchid or if he kills Full Gore.

1232
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:24,000
It's weird stuff, but they had all kinds of different stuff.

1233
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:31,000
With Kill Instinct Gold, which is the Nintendo 64 version that I said before, it was a near-launch title.

1234
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:35,000
And it did downgrade a few things, but it was pretty darn faithful.

1235
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:39,000
You had team battles where you could fight with up to 11 characters.

1236
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:45,000
You had elimination battles, training and advanced training, and a full option menu where you could modify stuff.

1237
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:53,000
Like, how fast the game went, the color of the blood button configuration, and your controller pack data and unlockable content, like different colors.

1238
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:58,000
And different scenarios and faster speeds of the game. You could make it, like, super fast.

1239
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:07,000
And most of the full motion video scenes were pretty much removed because, hi, it was a Nintendo 64, it was a cartridge.

1240
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:13,000
And so they did simple animations instead.

1241
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:20,000
And the game was fully rendered in 3D instead of the whole scaling full motion video.

1242
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:26,000
So it was pretty close to being good.

1243
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:31,000
And there actually was some censorship about that around Orchid.

1244
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:46,000
In the full version, there was a scene with Orchid in the introduction, and they actually played it on a UK show called Game Master,

1245
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:51,000
but it was cut when the arcade release came out, so maybe someone can fight it on YouTube. Who knows?

1246
01:13:51,000 --> 01:14:02,000
But it won four Nintendo Power Awards, and has a really good soundtrack called the Killer Instinct Gold Cuts soundtrack.

1247
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:06,000
And that's it.

1248
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:10,000
Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week, Killer Instincts 1 and 2.

1249
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
I guess 2 will have to share the stage this week.

1250
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,000
Let's just say gold.

1251
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:14,000
Fine, Killer Instinct Gold.

1252
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
But with major nods to the arcade versions.

1253
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:17,000
You got it.

1254
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:23,000
Alright, that's going to do it for part A of our show, but don't go anywhere. We've got plenty more to cover when we come back.

1255
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:29,000
When we come back, we're going to get into some things such as some rapid fire news, including news on Ninja Gaiden 3.

1256
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:32,000
Not the old one on the NES, but for new consoles.

1257
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:37,000
Talk a little bit more about Michael Jackson The Experience, some new tracks coming out for Rock Band,

1258
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:42,000
some changes going on at GameStop, and Atari reboots on iOS devices.

1259
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:47,000
We're going to talk about all that and more when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1260
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:53,000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, live on this Sunday evening, April the 10th of 2011,

1261
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:58,000
as we do tape live on Sunday nights at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.

1262
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:03,000
Now, we can't play the music on the podcast feed, but I have to mention this.

1263
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:06,000
That last song cut off rather awkwardly, didn't it?

1264
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
It was kind of suddenly like, and we're live.

1265
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:11,000
I can play clips. You can get away with playing clips on podcasts.

1266
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:15,000
We were playing a track called Work It Out from, what is this, Sonic R, right?

1267
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:18,000
So let me just play, let me play the last like 10 seconds of the MP3 here,

1268
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:21,000
and you get to see how awkwardly this cut off.

1269
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:26,000
I'm jamming, I'm jamming, I'm jamming, and it's done.

1270
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:29,000
You just kind of cut off.

1271
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
I hate how video game soundtracks kind of do that sometimes,

1272
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:35,000
but they're usually set up that way because they loop over and over again, so they don't like really fade out.

1273
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:38,000
So that's how usually you can tell the song that was kind of ripped from the game,

1274
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:41,000
or if it was for a CD, usually it will fade out on a CD

1275
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:45,000
because they don't want those awkward transitions like that, so.

1276
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:50,000
Anyhow, let's get into some rapid fire news, and then we'll get into Twitter topics.

1277
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:55,000
Of course, this is the last call for tweets at, at OLR on Twitter, so we're getting those in.

1278
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:58,000
We have a few, I like more random questions on the Twitter tonight.

1279
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
You know, video game questions are cool too.

1280
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
If you want to talk about news, that's fine. Link us to stories.

1281
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:05,000
I want some random questions, random gaming questions.

1282
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:09,000
Also, we always like to plug our other projects that we work on.

1283
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:12,000
Dark Soccer has another podcast if you like OLR you might like.

1284
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:18,000
It is called Comic Insanity, and it is me, Maren Marvel, and Dan Shadow, and we talk about comics.

1285
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:22,000
And we did not have a show this week, but next week.

1286
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:23,000
Frown.

1287
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:24,000
We will have a show.

1288
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,000
Smile.

1289
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
Grin. Happy face.

1290
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:28,000
Any more bigs?

1291
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:31,000
You can check us at infamous.net, N-F-A-M-O-U-S.

1292
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
Any more big celebrities planned for your show?

1293
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,000
You had some guy that was on Heroes.

1294
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
He was really cool. Todd Stashwick.

1295
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:37,000
Really nice guy.

1296
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:38,000
Who is he?

1297
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:39,000
Todd Stashwick.

1298
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:44,000
He was in season 4, so unfortunately it was after I stopped watching.

1299
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:47,000
He's been in Buffy and Supernatural.

1300
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:50,000
Fine. What was his power?

1301
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
He was the multiple man.

1302
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:55,000
Oh. Multiplicity sucked.

1303
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
The power to make you listen to any podcast.

1304
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:00,000
But he's a really cool guy. Really, really nice.

1305
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:05,000
And, uh, there's more coming.

1306
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
It's hard being an actor in Hollywood, too.

1307
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:11,000
Like, if I had been offered the role of a hero that just made people defecate on command.

1308
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:14,000
That would be awesome!

1309
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:19,000
They call me the Brown Note.

1310
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:23,000
If Rob thought of his nickname, it would be Poopy Pants.

1311
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
There you go.

1312
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
Well, excuse me, Mr. Poopy Pants.

1313
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:30,000
Defecating on command? Where do I sign?

1314
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
The Defecator.

1315
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:33,000
Nice.

1316
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:34,000
The Defecatrix.

1317
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:38,000
Well, now that I've brought defecation and your show in the same sentence, I apologize for that.

1318
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:41,000
But anything else you want to say about Comic Insanity?

1319
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:42,000
We're awesome. Listen to us.

1320
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:49,000
Alright. My Side Project is a show with the one and only X Tufur called The Best Lil' Horde House in Azeroth.

1321
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:52,000
Called Horde House for short. Visit us at www.hordehouse.com.

1322
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:56,000
If you like World of Warcraft, or even if you don't, you just like digging fart jokes, join us every week.

1323
01:17:56,000 --> 01:18:00,000
We put new shows up about Friday. We don't tape live right now. Maybe someday.

1324
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,000
We definitely want to get back into that at some point.

1325
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:07,000
I do want to throw this out there. Hordehouse.com is the website behind it.

1326
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:11,000
And we've been having more and more people kind of write for the site.

1327
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:14,000
And by more I mean one other person, but we have another one planned too.

1328
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:20,000
And one of the articles you just posted about How to Closet Your Dragon was the article.

1329
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:27,000
It's about how Blizzard has kind of deflamboyantized one of the monsters that was in Warcraft.

1330
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
It's been getting a ton of hits through Reddit.

1331
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:34,000
It's like a controversial article and I'm very excited because it's only like the third blog post on our site.

1332
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
So, big things in the future at Horde House.

1333
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:39,000
Lots of hordes to talk about.

1334
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:43,000
Alright. That's it. Let's move into some rapid fire news.

1335
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
And then we'll get to your tweets.

1336
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:48,000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R one more time.

1337
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:55,000
Loki. The latest issue of the official PlayStation Magazine had some neat little tidbits regarding the new Ninja Gaiden game.

1338
01:18:55,000 --> 01:19:01,000
Ninja Gaiden 3, which is going to be 3. Not Sigma 3. Just 3. Both systems.

1339
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:04,000
You know, all playing around harmoniously.

1340
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:10,000
There is some info. They're saying that there's going to be a complex multiplayer mode.

1341
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:15,000
They're not really drawing comparisons with Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2.

1342
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:20,000
But, you know, that sounds neat.

1343
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:23,000
I mean, everybody has multiplayer nowadays, so why not?

1344
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:29,000
They're saying that also Ryu is going to be the only playable character in the game this time around.

1345
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:37,000
None of these all, you know, bonus characters from Dead or Alive or, you know, the DS or whatever.

1346
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:44,000
They're also saying that there are going to be, you know, many difficulty levels, I guess.

1347
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:55,000
They're not necessarily making the game easier, but they're going to try to make the game more exciting and being able to be enjoyed by everybody, as well as hardcore gamers.

1348
01:19:55,000 --> 01:20:01,000
So, I'm assuming you'll probably hear more at E3 about this game, because it sounds like a pretty big one.

1349
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:06,000
Then, of course, Japan. Japan, Japan, Japan.

1350
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:13,000
They put out a lot of weird games in Japan, and there's a couple highlights that were on blogs this week.

1351
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:24,000
One comes from Famitsu. It's a cell phone game that's called I Love Woman's Body Climber.

1352
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:31,000
Basically, the premise is you climb up girls, and you are climbing them.

1353
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:40,000
For example, it's kind of like Shadow of the Colossus, but with schoolgirl anime chicks, and you're this tiny little dude.

1354
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:50,000
So, you have to, for example, it's harder to climb up bare skin than, say, pull yourself up on one of their sailor suits or whatever.

1355
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:59,000
Weird shit, but it's interesting. It sells for, I guess, 315 yen, which is relatively cheap.

1356
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:02,000
Does the little song play while you're climbing the woman?

1357
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:12,000
It should, though.

1358
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:20,000
You know what, people? Since the big thing is to now knock off games on Xbox Live Indie Marketplace.

1359
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:24,000
There you go. That's a niche that's not being filled with weird shit like that.

1360
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:32,000
Scale woman's bodies to yodel music. That'd be awesome. Seriously, that would be just amazing.

1361
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:37,000
That was inspired by the cliffhangers game on The Price is Right, by the way, when a little dude climbs the mountain.

1362
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:42,000
Yodels? Forget it. Lots of old-school game show references on tonight's show.

1363
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:59,000
Okay, let's see. The next game, which I'm going to try to pronounce here, but I probably will do a bad job of it. It's Gachi Tora, Abrarenbo, Kyoshi in High School.

1364
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:16,000
And basically, this looks like a weird high school game with a system called the Soul Nude Battle System. And what the Soul Nude Battle System is, apparently you can...

1365
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
I hope this isn't a Kinect game.

1366
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:31,000
You can break a wall. It says you can break a wall the student has placed around her heart by screaming at them or something, using soul words.

1367
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:39,000
So why do I have a feeling like, you know, a chef being in there, you know? Chef's Soul Nude Battle System.

1368
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:46,000
Basically, you scream at people and they take off their clothes, or their clothes come off. So that's what that's about, and that's on the PSP.

1369
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:59,000
What's also weird though, on top of all that, I guess you also can play baseball and do some other weird minigames in there, but it just looks very oddball.

1370
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:03,000
Screaming at someone and makes them naked. If only that worked.

1371
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:16,000
It's almost like Pee Wee's secret word of the day. When someone says the word of the day, scream real loud.

1372
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:19,000
And then last but not least...

1373
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
Clothes fly off like the Minnie Hill Show.

1374
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:35,000
Little bit of a disappointment. Come on, Nintendo. Why? Why? Why? DSiWare. I guess, you know, the DSi shop, although not available yet, much like the Wii Shop originally worked.

1375
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:41,000
Games from the DSi shop cannot be run off of an SD memory card.

1376
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:53,000
And while the Wii had a patch later on that allowed you to do that, the DSi does not allow you that. You have to put the game on the internal memory and that's where it's going to stay.

1377
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:56,000
And that's it.

1378
01:23:56,000 --> 01:24:05,000
It says apparently though, of course, the 3DSWare and Virtual Console games will be able to directly play off an SD card.

1379
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:14,000
DSiWare that you buy new or transfer over on the 3DS still requires you to store it to the internal memory of the 3DS.

1380
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:18,000
It's kind of a step backwards, I guess.

1381
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
Is that like their copy protection?

1382
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:29,000
No, it doesn't make any sense. DSiWare is the only thing that's stuck like that. 3DSWare or Virtual Console stuff? Oh, you can put that back and forth.

1383
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
DSiWare? No.

1384
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
That's weird.

1385
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:38,000
Must be something about the, I don't know, emulating or something, I don't know.

1386
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:43,000
Something that they have running on there probably is limiting it, but I mean, come on. Just patch that shit.

1387
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:48,000
Well, but I mean, let's be real, Loki. Is there anything on DSiWare that you really have to play that bad?

1388
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:51,000
Yes, actually there is something now that you mentioned it.

1389
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,000
Uh oh.

1390
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
It was something that didn't make our show roll, but it's pretty awesome.

1391
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:59,000
It's a DSiWare application, not even really a game. It's called Inchworm Animation.

1392
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:13,000
And this thing is just fucking crazy. Basically, it's an animation program developed by Bob Sebastian from Flat Black Films, the company responsible for rotoscoping in The Waking Life and in the Scanner Darkly.

1393
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:19,000
And apparently this game or program or whatever you want to do, you can do all sorts of crazy stuff.

1394
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:25,000
You can do rotoscoping, you can do green screen, you can do time lapse photography using this.

1395
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:33,000
You can make your own animations, all sorts of crazy stuff for five dollars. Five dollars.

1396
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:38,000
Seriously, they could have sold this shit for, you know, thirty dollars and been able to sell a ton of it.

1397
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
But yeah, that's coming out April 25th.

1398
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:44,000
Nice. Alright. Well, let's move on.

1399
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:50,000
Of course, I can't play it on April 25th because they haven't released a damn store yet for, you know, the 3DS.

1400
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:54,000
Oh, sorry, we didn't finish that part of the 3DS.

1401
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:58,000
Well, something you will be able to buy whenever it does come out, you don't know Jack.

1402
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:03,000
Of course, the revival just came out on the 360 and the PlayStation 3 and it's pretty damn good.

1403
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:09,000
You'll be able to now buy this on the iPhone or your whatever iOS device, iTouch, iPad.

1404
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:13,000
We don't know exactly when, but it has been announced that you don't know Jack is coming out on these systems.

1405
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:18,000
It kind of strikes me as a duh because, you know, you don't know Jack. It comes out on every system.

1406
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
So I'm not surprised it's coming out on iOS as well.

1407
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:28,000
Now, it's not going to support multiplayer, however. It will have Game Center support and it will have 20 full episodes.

1408
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:33,000
Now, I don't know if these are 20 recycled episodes in the console games or 20 all new episodes.

1409
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:39,000
I really hope it's all new. But yeah, the game is on its way at some point.

1410
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:45,000
Battlefield 3, some people are very exciting about this and it's going to have a lot of ads.

1411
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:49,000
I hope you like your ads in your game because Battlefield 3 is going to have a lot of them.

1412
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:54,000
That's right because, let's see, John Riccitello, who of course is the Electronic Arts CEO,

1413
01:26:54,000 --> 01:27:03,000
he was talking to advertisers saying, quote, expect a couple hundred million dollars in marketing against, you know, the Call of Duty and so forth.

1414
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
It's designed to take Call of Duty down.

1415
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:12,000
Now, Riccitello said, kind of in a follow-up to that, that in-game advertising doesn't necessarily mean billboards.

1416
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:18,000
Half of online multiplayer time is spent in lobbies and that's where folks are expecting advertising.

1417
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:21,000
So you might be seeing ads in the lobbies, you should wait for games.

1418
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:27,000
No, people are expecting advertising on TV, not on a multiplayer lobby.

1419
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,000
That's kind of just an asshole thing to do.

1420
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:33,000
So not only are there going to be ads on TV for the game, for them to try and beat Call of Duty,

1421
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:38,000
but there's going to be plenty of ads in the game as well. That should be lots of fun.

1422
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:43,000
Hey, Michael Jackson, the experience, the game that Loki's looking forward to next week on the Xbox 360,

1423
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:47,000
it's already sold 3 million units globally because, you know, the game has been out on the Wii.

1424
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:51,000
It's basically just dance, but it's all Michael Jackson songs.

1425
01:27:51,000 --> 01:28:01,000
Yeah, the Wii, the DS and PSP versions, they've sold 319,000 units in the UK, 11%, they said, of the global sales.

1426
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:04,000
So that means it's sold about 3 million worldwide.

1427
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:07,000
I'm not too surprised that this is probably sold a lot, especially in the US.

1428
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
You know, people love their Michael Jackson.

1429
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
So, there you go.

1430
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:14,000
But so much for the music genre being dead.

1431
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
Yeah, that's true, that's true.

1432
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
Alright, DarkSakura.

1433
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:23,000
Well, we definitely have other news.

1434
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:29,000
Going into Rock Band, we have Fleetwood Mac and, of course, a solo member, Stevie Nicks.

1435
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:33,000
This is the Fleetwood Mac slash Stevie Nicks Pack 1.

1436
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:37,000
It has Dreams by Fleetwood Mac, Gold Dust Woman, Landslide, and Rhiannon.

1437
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:41,000
And then from Stevie Nicks, there's Edge of Seventeen and Stand Back.

1438
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:50,000
And it looks like Dreams and Edge of Seventeen both have Pro Guitar bass expansions available for another 99 cents.

1439
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
God, I love Stevie Nicks. She's a fierce bitch.

1440
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:53,000
She is.

1441
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:59,000
And then, ooh, Silent Hill Revelation, which is gonna be the next movie based off of Silent Hill 3.

1442
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:05,000
And Carrie-Anne Moss is gonna be in it as Claudia Wolf, who may or may not be evil.

1443
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:13,000
And we also have in there Malcolm McDowell, who's going to be Leonard Wolf, who may or may not be evil.

1444
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:17,000
Who knows? We've played the game we know.

1445
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:21,000
And then Mass Effect 3 is not going to be multiplayer.

1446
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:25,000
They may do multiplayer in later games, but not Mass Effect 3.

1447
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,000
Confirmed Mass Effect 4.

1448
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:35,000
They are going to expand the RPG elements with larger skill trees and different power evolutions.

1449
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:44,000
And they are not going to make the weapons as customizable as they were, but they're going to have different behavioral changes and appearance changes.

1450
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:48,000
And all weapons can be used by all classes.

1451
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:52,000
So, cool. But not as cool.

1452
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
Is it?

1453
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:55,000
I don't know.

1454
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:58,000
Alright, let's get to the Twitter topics.

1455
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:02,000
Every week we invite you guys to tweet us at twitter.com slash OLR.

1456
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:03,000
Let's read some of the tweets tonight.

1457
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:07,000
Defective Candy tweets us and says, forgot my MP3 player the other day.

1458
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:11,000
Was so happy I remembered about OLR's Podlines.

1459
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:14,000
Phone plus OLR equals awesome.

1460
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
And I had to rack my brain for a minute after reading this tweet.

1461
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:19,000
I was like, what the hell is Podlines?

1462
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:26,000
And then I remembered, there's this service online called Podlines where apparently you can like call and listen to podcasts on the phone.

1463
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:29,000
Like you don't even need an iPhone or whatever to do it.

1464
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:35,000
So, I don't really officially endorse this site, but I guess it's kind of cool what they're doing.

1465
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:39,000
Apparently you can call this number and, you know, I'm going to call it and see what happens actually right now.

1466
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:46,000
You can call this number, it's area code 650, so please notice that is not an 800 number, so there is a charge with that.

1467
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:50,000
It's area code 650-523-6855.

1468
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:55,000
And this is from the website Podlines, L-I-N-E-Z dot com.

1469
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:58,000
And let's see what happens when we give it a call.

1470
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
Am I going to hear myself? I guess so.

1471
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:04,000
New music from independent artists. Call song numbers radio.

1472
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:07,000
Well, I don't know, I don't care about these independent artists.

1473
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:08,000
Don't you hear me?

1474
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:09,000
Quadruple zero.

1475
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
I don't want to hear the ad, I want to hear me.

1476
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:19,000
Wow, it's last week's show in really crappy quality.

1477
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:26,000
Wow, it's last week's show.

1478
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:29,000
You can listen on the phone, call on your cell phone.

1479
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:32,000
Interesting.

1480
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:37,000
I guess that's a neat idea for a service though, and obviously they're making money off those little ads in the beginning.

1481
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:40,000
A lot of people have like damn limited minutes plan or, you know, stuff like that.

1482
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:43,000
True, especially night time minutes like if you're working a graveyard shift.

1483
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
Too cheap for an iPhone, there's a way to do it.

1484
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:50,000
Alright, let's see. Ronnie Bailey is saying at OLR, listening to OLR.

1485
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:53,000
I want an OLR autograph.

1486
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
Okay, I've got a tissue, I've got a pen.

1487
01:31:55,000 --> 01:32:01,000
Alright, Ronnie Bailey just needs to DM us his address and we will autograph something and send it to him.

1488
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
How about an empty CD case?

1489
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
We'll find something. I might have something in.

1490
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:06,000
There's my coffee cup.

1491
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
You would give away your coffee cup?

1492
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:09,000
It's in the trash can right now.

1493
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:10,000
Oh, it's a Starbucks coffee cup.

1494
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
Alright, we'll find something for Ronnie Bailey.

1495
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:13,000
We'll find something that isn't trash.

1496
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
DM us your address and we will send you something.

1497
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:16,000
Yeah.

1498
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:19,000
Alright, just because you asked.

1499
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:22,000
And I don't want everybody else jumping in there and saying, I want free shit, I want free shit.

1500
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:25,000
No, Ronnie Bailey gets it because he has it nicely first.

1501
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:29,000
Alright, let's see. Tiger Claw says his tweet, oh I heard about this.

1502
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:32,000
This is 1 versus 100. It's coming back y'all. 1 versus 100 is coming back.

1503
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:33,000
Yay.

1504
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
Not on Xbox Live though.

1505
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:36,000
Boo.

1506
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:39,000
1 versus 100 is coming back as a Facebook game.

1507
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
Double Boo.

1508
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
Where's my fail horn for that one?

1509
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:47,000
1 versus 100 is coming back as a Facebook game.

1510
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:51,000
I guess the version on Game Show Network didn't do too hot, just so you know.

1511
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:55,000
It's being developed by iWin. It is being licensed by NML USA.

1512
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:58,000
And it will be the mob versus the one structure.

1513
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:04,000
Individual players will be inviting their friends to join the mob to answer questions.

1514
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:08,000
And I guess either knock off them or the user. I don't really know how this works.

1515
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:11,000
So there's also Facebook different modes there.

1516
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:15,000
It will not just be the Xbox version ported. It's being remade by iWin.

1517
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:19,000
But if you want to play 1 versus 100, I guess you'll have to go to Facebooks.

1518
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:24,000
You can put that in between your farm and your Knights of the Clicky.

1519
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:28,000
Another tweet from Tiger Claw 305.

1520
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:33,000
Apparently Kojima has been teasing a new Snatcher game.

1521
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:39,000
Didn't we have a rumor a couple weeks ago that Kojima was working on something new and didn't really say what it was yet?

1522
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:44,000
Stop working on new stuff and finish the damn game that you have in progress.

1523
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:47,000
Well hey, a new Snatcher game could be pretty cool.

1524
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:50,000
So Snatcher was a text based adventure game.

1525
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:58,000
I remember something about a year ago, maybe a few months ago, where folks were translating the second game in the series.

1526
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:04,000
So yeah, Snatcher I guess has been dormant for a long time.

1527
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:12,000
But I guess he tweeted something like, quote, I've readied a complete Snatcher set for some reason.

1528
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:16,000
So I don't know, maybe people are taking that tweet very far.

1529
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:22,000
And I also hate that Twitter is now becoming a respectable news source, but there you go.

1530
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:25,000
Alright, anyhow, so that could be coming soon.

1531
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:30,000
It would be kind of neat. I do remember the whole Kojima is working on something and maybe Snatcher would be it.

1532
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:34,000
So we'll see.

1533
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:38,000
Let's see, I guess ActDeft is tweeting us this.

1534
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:42,000
Game Boy music video is exactly what it sounds like.

1535
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:47,000
It's an article on Joystiq here that has a Game Boy, a bunch of Game Boys.

1536
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:53,000
Let's see this.

1537
01:34:53,000 --> 01:35:00,000
Oh, see, the reason why you're hearing all these hammering sounds and things is somebody actually clicking their Game Boy

1538
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:04,000
and putting headphones into the slot, getting that humming noise and things like that.

1539
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:08,000
I was thinking it was actually going to be like chiptunes.

1540
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:13,000
But no, this is somebody doing random things with an old-ass Game Boy.

1541
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:16,000
That's pretty cool. It takes talent to put something like that together.

1542
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
Neato.

1543
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:23,000
Sonic has linked us to this. I believe this is also from Joystiq.

1544
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:28,000
Except he just linked us to the picture. It has something to do with Child of Eden.

1545
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
We didn't get actually linked to the article.

1546
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:35,000
Yeah, Child of Eden seems cool. I'm actually really looking forward to that game.

1547
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:40,000
Some folks that were playing it at PAX were really enjoying it too.

1548
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:48,000
Remember, I don't know, they said it's going to support up to four controllers vibrating or something like that.

1549
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
This is the corset, isn't it? Something about a corset.

1550
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:51,000
Yes.

1551
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:56,000
Oh, yes. I do remember reading about that. Awesome.

1552
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:59,000
Let's get some more tweets. Gamer Girl tweets us saying,

1553
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:04,000
Which do you think is better, Japanese versions of games or American versions of games?

1554
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:05,000
That depends on the game.

1555
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:10,000
Yeah, it's so wide open. It really depends on the game.

1556
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:14,000
I mean, usually I like American versions of games because I can understand them,

1557
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
because I don't speak Japanese.

1558
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:21,000
But a lot of the old music games, especially back in the PlayStation 1 era, were way better in Japan.

1559
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:24,000
Like, the Bust-A-Move series was better in Japan.

1560
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:27,000
Most of the old DDR games were way better in Japan.

1561
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:30,000
Like, DDR Third Mix on PlayStation 1 was the bomb.

1562
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:35,000
But over here, we got, like, DDR USA Mix. Not so hot.

1563
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:38,000
So yeah, it really depends on what game you're talking about.

1564
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
So it's really wide open.

1565
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:44,000
Blue Swim sends us some random tweets. I like these random tweets.

1566
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:50,000
What was the first music album and first game soundtrack you bought?

1567
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:55,000
The first game soundtrack I bought?

1568
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
Uh...

1569
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,000
That's a good question.

1570
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:05,000
Ironically enough, it was probably DDR Third Mix for me.

1571
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:12,000
Because, you know, I remember trying to get soundtracks online of, like, Final Fantasy VI,

1572
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:15,000
and, like, the old school Final Fantasy games. Like, I was really into those musics.

1573
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:19,000
But, you know, it was really hard to get music on CD back then over here.

1574
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:22,000
So I would say you probably have to go back to when we first, you know,

1575
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:26,000
were really starting to see more game soundtracks come out on CD in the CD gaming era.

1576
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:30,000
And probably something like DDR Third Mix for me.

1577
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:34,000
Well, I had, um, we had a bunch of, like, when I first moved in with Dan,

1578
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:37,000
we had the TurboGrafx games that we could just, you know, play the CD.

1579
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
Because they were Redbook Audio.

1580
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:44,000
So, but, and I'll tell you what, actually I know the first one that I personally bought

1581
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:49,000
that was not a bootleg.

1582
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,000
Because, you know, we used to get those all the time.

1583
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:55,000
And this was, like, me personally buying it with my own money by myself going out,

1584
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:58,000
not people sending me copies or anything or all that.

1585
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:02,000
Is, um, I went out and bought the Bust A Move soundtrack right when it came out.

1586
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:03,000
Oh nice.

1587
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:07,000
They had the screensaver and everything built in with it and all the cool stuff.

1588
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:13,000
And then, I actually, that's the first one that I personally went out to buy.

1589
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:18,000
I mean, we found other ones. We've been given other ones, you know.

1590
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:22,000
But that was the one I went out first on a mission to get.

1591
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:26,000
Others, you know, we just sort of looked into or found or, you know, said,

1592
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
Oh, that's neat. Let's get it. You know.

1593
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:29,000
Awesome.

1594
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:35,000
And actually, there's been other, two others that I've bought the actual Japanese soundtracks for.

1595
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:40,000
And that is Bust A Move 2, the dancing game, guys.

1596
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:43,000
And Two Mix's Greatest Hits.

1597
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:44,000
Nice.

1598
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:48,000
Going to our chat room. I'm catching up on chat comments because I've been reading Twitter's.

1599
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:51,000
SalaciousPop reminded me of something we saw the other day saying,

1600
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:54,000
Zinga is now in the old Sega building in San Francisco.

1601
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:57,000
True facts. Driving back from San Francisco the other day on Friday.

1602
01:38:57,000 --> 01:39:00,000
Driving by the old Sega building. You know, you'd see that.

1603
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
Like, drive coming off 280, going back onto 80.

1604
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:05,000
You drive by that old Sega building. Yeah, Zinga's in there now.

1605
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:06,000
Doesn't that make you sad?

1606
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:07,000
That's crazy sad.

1607
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:08,000
That's very sad.

1608
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:11,000
Sj100Matt in our chat room says, No offense, but F-Snatcher.

1609
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,000
Zone of the Enders, please.

1610
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,000
NacDeft follows up with that.

1611
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:19,000
Where's my third Zone of the Enders, dammit?

1612
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:20,000
Absolutely right.

1613
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:25,000
Tigerclaw says, My first video game soundtrack, if you can call it that, is the Mortal Kombat CD.

1614
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:29,000
And I'm not talking about the movie soundtrack, but the one by the Immortals.

1615
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,000
Oh god, I forgot about that disc.

1616
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:34,000
Oh yeah, I had that too. I did have that.

1617
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:37,000
That might have been my first one too.

1618
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:38,000
I did have that.

1619
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:41,000
I had the movie soundtrack too. The movie soundtrack was so awesome.

1620
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:42,000
It was sick!

1621
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:49,000
I think my first soundtrack was Gran Turismo and then I remember DDR Fourth Mix.

1622
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:54,000
This is the other one I bought. I bought that at a con.

1623
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:55,000
Awesome.

1624
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,000
Last tweet from Blue Swim.

1625
01:39:57,000 --> 01:40:01,000
If you could deep fry any candy bar, which one would it be?

1626
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:05,000
Mmm, deep fried Milky Ways and Twix bars and Hershey's bars.

1627
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:08,000
I've never had a deep fried candy bar, so I'm not sure how they taste.

1628
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:09,000
I've had deep fried Snickers.

1629
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:10,000
Is it good?

1630
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
I could only eat half of it. It made me sick.

1631
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
I know, it just sounds like too much.

1632
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:17,000
I don't want any candy bar deep fried. I want them frozen.

1633
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:21,000
I would say Almond Joy, because I like the Almond Joy a lot.

1634
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:24,000
I like almond coconut stuff.

1635
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:31,000
Not a big fan of candy bars, but if we got to pick something,

1636
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:36,000
it's not really a candy bar, but it's what happens when you leave a bag of,

1637
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:39,000
or I should say, let me correct this,

1638
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:43,000
a three pound bag of gummy bears in your car during the hot summer.

1639
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:46,000
It forms into a giant gummy pillow.

1640
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:47,000
Mecha gummy.

1641
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,000
Mecha gummy, if you will.

1642
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:56,000
Sort of a Tetsuo gone crazy mecha gummy or ultra gummy.

1643
01:40:56,000 --> 01:41:03,000
Take that, bread that, and dip it in so you have a nice gooey pillow of fried gummy.

1644
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
Oh god, that sounds terrible.

1645
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:09,000
And it's extremely dangerous because you'd be hot molten inside.

1646
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,000
You'd have to let that cool off a bit.

1647
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,000
Oh my god.

1648
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:17,000
One time I remember Alan got these little, they were like those strawberry candies.

1649
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:21,000
You ever those little strawberry puffy, strawberry puffs I think they're called.

1650
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:25,000
But they were like Hello Kitty brand and they were so good.

1651
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,000
I want to deep fry those.

1652
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:28,000
Deep fried Hello Kitty.

1653
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:31,000
So much to deep fry nerds.

1654
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,000
Alright, that's it for Twitter topics.

1655
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,000
Bread every single one of them.

1656
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:39,000
That's right, we're getting way off topic, but twitter.com slash o-l-r.

1657
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,000
Let's get back into some other gaming news.

1658
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,000
Loki.

1659
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:49,000
Speaking of abominations coming to Facebook.

1660
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:54,000
GameStop has decided, hey you know what, Facebook people are there.

1661
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:58,000
So we're going to put a storefront there and we're going to sell shit there.

1662
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:02,000
Because, you know, that's what we do.

1663
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:08,000
Honestly, and this kind of even goes back to just Facebook as it is.

1664
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:13,000
Liking stuff, you have to understand what liking something means.

1665
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:16,000
Liking something means you're going to get spammed by them.

1666
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:19,000
So, not us of course, we don't spam a lot.

1667
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,000
I don't think we post a lot on Facebook anyways.

1668
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:28,000
But, you know, when it comes to companies, you can guarantee that they're going to be spamming you with a bunch of shit.

1669
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:35,000
So, liking GameStop, you better believe that they're going to be letting you know, hey, hey, there's a game pre-booking.

1670
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:37,000
You want to buy it?

1671
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:42,000
Hey, hey, hey, listen, hey, maybe you should pre-order something.

1672
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:46,000
You know, we got pre-orders. Come on in, pre-order things.

1673
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:50,000
I hate going in there every time they're like, so what game are you looking forward to?

1674
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:53,000
Because I know that's, so what game can I pre-order for you?

1675
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:54,000
No.

1676
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:57,000
And I tell them, I'm like, I'm not looking forward to anything.

1677
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
I hate it all.

1678
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:02,000
Why are you in here, dude?

1679
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
Because I'm buying something to come out.

1680
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:12,000
I'm really at that point where, yeah, I just like to go to Best Buy or Fry's or some huge store that happens to have video games.

1681
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
You know what I mean?

1682
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:17,000
Unless it's like some collector's edition that's super exclusive.

1683
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,000
You do not need to pre-order anything.

1684
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
You can find them in stores.

1685
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:26,000
It's just like, you know, oh, you better pre-order that 3DS because you'll never be able to find it.

1686
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
No, they're all over the fucking place.

1687
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:32,000
It's just, just wait.

1688
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
Be a little patient.

1689
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:39,000
I know that sounds really ridiculous coming from me, but seriously.

1690
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:44,000
You, mister, I'm gonna pay 200 bucks for Motorstorm Apocalypse?

1691
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:45,000
No.

1692
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:46,000
Be patient?

1693
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:49,000
No.

1694
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:50,000
Huh?

1695
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
It's a collector's item, okay?

1696
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:53,000
Mm-hmm.

1697
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:57,000
Mister, I'm gonna import my 3DS.

1698
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:58,000
You know what?

1699
01:43:58,000 --> 01:43:59,000
I actually-

1700
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:00,000
I sold that, okay?

1701
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:01,000
Oh, okay.

1702
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:02,000
Did you make your money back?

1703
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:03,000
Yes.

1704
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:04,000
Wow, nice.

1705
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
So, I would say that that was awesome.

1706
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:09,000
It was like renting a 3DS for a month.

1707
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:12,000
Yeah, it worked out.

1708
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:17,000
But yeah, I mean, so yeah, it's not a big surprise.

1709
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:21,000
And of course, you know, they recently acquired Impulse and Spawn Labs.

1710
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:30,000
So, they're trying to make, I guess, as much of, make themselves as much in your face as possible.

1711
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:39,000
And I guess, yeah, you'll be able to purchase, reserve titles, view trailers, screenshots, and all that stuff.

1712
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,000
So, yeah.

1713
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:42,000
Alright.

1714
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:45,000
Well, Atari games are new all over again.

1715
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:51,000
It seems like we have a story like this every year, because Atari games always seem to get re-released for some freaking console.

1716
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:56,000
And this week, it's the iOS systems, the iPhone, the iPad, and so forth.

1717
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:59,000
Atari's Greatest Hits was released this week.

1718
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:03,000
And apparently, 100 games are available through this.

1719
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,000
Here's the deal.

1720
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:09,000
You get a free shell of the game that comes with Pong for free just for downloading it,

1721
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:14,000
which obviously is one of the big Atari games ever, although it hasn't aged well at all.

1722
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:21,000
But you can pick up a variety of edition packs for 99 cents each.

1723
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:24,000
And you can get extra games that come with them.

1724
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:29,000
You can just buy all 100 freaking games for $14.99 if you want the old games.

1725
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:35,000
Some of the games you can get, Tempest, Crystal Castles, Yars Revenge, Combat, and so forth.

1726
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:40,000
Now, usually you kind of look at this and go, great, yay, it's the same thing all over again.

1727
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:46,000
But one of the cool things that it does have, you can do multiplayer over Bluetooth connections.

1728
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:47,000
So that's kind of cool.

1729
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,000
For some games.

1730
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:50,000
Yeah, not everything.

1731
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:53,000
But for some of the games, it has multiplayer over Bluetooth.

1732
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:54,000
So that's kind of cool.

1733
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:57,000
It's already more useful than Game Room.

1734
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,000
Sad.

1735
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:05,000
Game Room could have been so good, but it's dead now.

1736
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:10,000
They haven't officially canceled Game Room, but they also haven't put anything out for it since the end of last year.

1737
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
It's left as a graveyard.

1738
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:17,000
I know. Sad face.

1739
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:20,000
Well, how about something that's a little bit less than sad?

1740
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:21,000
Okay.

1741
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:22,000
Is it my turn?

1742
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:27,000
Streets of Rage, also known as Bare Knuckle.

1743
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,000
It's getting a remake after eight years.

1744
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:34,000
And it's, well, it was actually started by Bomber Games.

1745
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:38,000
They started doing something called Streets of Rage remake in 2003.

1746
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:42,000
And now they put out the final version as freeware on PC.

1747
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:47,000
So maybe Sega's not upset about that.

1748
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:52,000
But it's really not so much of a remake as much as a new game.

1749
01:46:52,000 --> 01:47:02,000
It's using new code, has 103 stages, and playable characters from 1, 2, and 3 with new abilities and new characters.

1750
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:09,000
There's new enemies based off of the Game Gear ones and cover illustrations are added on there.

1751
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:17,000
There is boss rush, volleyball, AI partner mode, and other modes and a level editor.

1752
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:23,000
So I'm watching a little bit of this and it just looks pretty neat.

1753
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:28,000
There's a scene where you're outrunning a bulldozer and you have to fight walls.

1754
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:31,000
And you can actually fight the bulldozer too.

1755
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,000
That's pretty funny.

1756
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,000
I want to fight a bulldozer, but not really.

1757
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:40,000
You just kick the bulldozer and it goes backwards and then you go back to kicking the wall some more.

1758
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
And then the bulldozer knocks you over.

1759
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
Man vs. Bulldozer.

1760
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
Film 11.

1761
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
Awesome.

1762
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:49,000
Kind of cool.

1763
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:52,000
Damn those knee-high walls.

1764
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:55,000
Oh, he's getting my way.

1765
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:58,000
Someone driving a bulldozer through a building is what I want to know.

1766
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
I guess I'll have to play the game to find out.

1767
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:03,000
Oh, I remembered a game I did play this week because it was on sale.

1768
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:04,000
It was the X-Men arcade game.

1769
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
I don't think I talked about this last week.

1770
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:07,000
No, go ahead.

1771
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
Yeah, the X-Men arcade game.

1772
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,000
You know, better in my memories.

1773
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:14,000
As sadly a lot of the retro classics end up being.

1774
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:15,000
Not all of them though.

1775
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,000
Pitfall 2, still as awesome as I remember.

1776
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:18,000
Just saying.

1777
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:21,000
But some of the games were better in my memory.

1778
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:22,000
Anyhow.

1779
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:27,000
I'm kind of, well, actually I'm not too excited about Mortal Kombat.

1780
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:32,000
But it is neat to see that there's some stuff coming to the 360 since the PlayStation 3 version

1781
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,000
does get, you know, Kratos.

1782
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:39,000
The 360 though, and this is all considered to be rumor, although they do have some screenshots

1783
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:42,000
that kind of confirm that.

1784
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:49,000
It's supposed to be getting some exclusives, including a puzzle combat mode.

1785
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:54,000
Also, a King of the Hill mode, which I guess will feature Avatar support.

1786
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:57,000
How that works is beyond me.

1787
01:48:57,000 --> 01:49:03,000
Also, an arena called the Pit 360, which is a remake of Mortal Kombat 3's The Pit 3.

1788
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:08,000
And additionally, I guess they're saying that the DLC character Lady in Red will be offered

1789
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:12,000
as a free download for Xbox Live users for a limited time.

1790
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:20,000
Also, Mortal Kombat themed Avatar gear available for purchase on Xbox Live as well.

1791
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:24,000
No confirmation on everything, but there are some screenshots that kind of show, you know,

1792
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:28,000
the Pit and these Avatars watching the fight.

1793
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:31,000
So it's a little interesting, I guess.

1794
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:38,000
And then on top of that, you may remember the Mortal Kombat kind of pitch for, you know,

1795
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:44,000
a new reimagining of the movie series, which I really wish would have happened, but it didn't.

1796
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:48,000
But instead it became this now web series that's going to be going on.

1797
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:52,000
And apparently the premiere of this web series is going to be on the 12th.

1798
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
That's right, on Tuesday.

1799
01:49:54,000 --> 01:50:00,000
And you can check it out, the first episode of that, including, you know,

1800
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:03,000
Michael Jai White's supposed to be in that still.

1801
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:08,000
And it's going to have eight episodes, I guess, leading up to the April 19th launch day.

1802
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:12,000
And yeah, you can check that out.

1803
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:16,000
It's going to be on Makima.com at 4 p.m.

1804
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
It's probably going to be really gross.

1805
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
I should show it to my mom so she can watch it.

1806
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:23,000
This is gross, Rob. What are you making me watch? This is sick.

1807
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:26,000
I think I would definitely want to check it out. It looked pretty cool.

1808
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
Yeah, it does look pretty cool.

1809
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:32,000
Again, can't explain it. I hate the Saw movies, yet I love Mortal Kombat even when it's gross.

1810
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:36,000
But there'll probably be nothing as over-the-top as what you see in the game in these movies.

1811
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:37,000
No.

1812
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:40,000
I don't think I'm going to see Melina eating, like, ripping off someone's face and eating their tongue

1813
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
and then spiking the head on the ground.

1814
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:43,000
That'd be awesome.

1815
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:46,000
I did get to see the subway fatality.

1816
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:47,000
Oh yeah?

1817
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:48,000
That's awesome.

1818
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:53,000
It's like he holds her head on the subway so that their heads go through all the windows.

1819
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:54,000
Oh yeah.

1820
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,000
And then he throws them in front of another train. It's awesome.

1821
01:50:56,000 --> 01:51:02,000
You know what they should have done, which have been kind of fun as a parody of some of the other fighting game series?

1822
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:08,000
Do Mortal Kombat Xtreme Beach Volleyball and actually have that where they take someone's head and spike it on the ground

1823
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:12,000
and make it really ridiculously bloody.

1824
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:15,000
Let's see. Let me look at this here real quick. Let's see if this is it.

1825
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,000
Here we go. Here we go.

1826
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:22,000
There you go.

1827
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:25,000
And there it goes. Oncoming train.

1828
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:28,000
That's awesome.

1829
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:33,000
They showed a lot of... What I was looking at was the x-ray vision in the moves.

1830
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:36,000
Yeah, those are like the special moves that you can do. It's pretty cool.

1831
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:40,000
I don't know. I didn't like the demo at first, but it really started growing on me.

1832
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:43,000
And I think the final game is going to do that too. So we'll see.

1833
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:47,000
I'm going to definitely check that out when it comes out. Very cool.

1834
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:51,000
Portal news. Because Portal 2 is on the way.

1835
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:55,000
I was really shocked to see that this game is literally around the corner.

1836
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:59,000
Speaking of this whole driving through San Francisco thing, they have a lot of video game billboards in San Francisco.

1837
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:03,000
I don't know if you know this. I saw a Marvel vs. Capcom 3 billboard.

1838
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:07,000
I saw a Super Street Fighter 3D... Super Street... Excuse me.

1839
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:10,000
Street Fighter 4 3D.

1840
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
Super Street Fighter 4 3D.

1841
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:15,000
Damn it. Whatever the fuck that game is. I saw a billboard for that too.

1842
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:19,000
And then I saw a billboard for Portal 2 and it said the release date was April 9th.

1843
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:22,000
And I kind of did that... Oh, holy shit. Or April 19th, excuse me.

1844
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:25,000
I kind of did that whole, holy shit, that game is coming out really soon.

1845
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:27,000
So I guess the billboard accomplished what it's supposed to do.

1846
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:30,000
My birthday is April 19th, everybody.

1847
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:36,000
Well, anyhow, to wrap up for your birthday dark soccer in anticipation of Portal 2,

1848
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:40,000
there is a comic that's out now. Portal 2 Lab Rat.

1849
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
That's right. It's a comic that you can read through.

1850
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:48,000
It's on IGN Comics at comics.ign.com and you can check that out.

1851
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
It's a free comic, so if you want to read that.

1852
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
Maybe that's something you can talk about on Comic Insanity.

1853
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:56,000
I don't know if you do the whole virtual comics, but Portal 2 might be a good excuse.

1854
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:57,000
Yeah.

1855
01:52:57,000 --> 01:53:04,000
Also of note, Joko, Jonathan Coulton, of course doing the music for Portal 2, I believe.

1856
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
He's contributing to that as well, right?

1857
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
Didn't I use something? He's doing some of that.

1858
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:14,000
Well, there is a new version of Portals Still Alive that's going to be coming out.

1859
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:20,000
I don't know if this is with regards to Portal 2 or what, but this is coming out through Twitter.

1860
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:28,000
I guess it's Jonathan Coulton and They Might Be Giants because John Flassenburg from They Might Be Giants,

1861
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:31,000
he's producing Jonathan Coulton's upcoming album.

1862
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:35,000
And I guess one of the tracks they're doing for this album is a new version of Still Alive.

1863
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:40,000
And it's going to feature Sarah Quinn. She's from Tegan and Sarah, so she'll be in this new one.

1864
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
That's pretty cool. I really like Tegan and Sarah.

1865
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:45,000
They do a great live show because they like to tell stories.

1866
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:49,000
I like going to concerts where they actually talk and interact with the audience.

1867
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,000
And Tegan and Sarah do this better than anyone else I've seen.

1868
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:57,000
Like Britney Spears, I don't get her concerts because all she does, she just comes out from the stage,

1869
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:59,000
parades around and lip syncs for two hours.

1870
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:02,000
She might say, hey, Sacramento, and then that's it.

1871
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
She parades back to her five-star hotel.

1872
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
There's something else super cool in this, Rob.

1873
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:07,000
What else do you want to say?

1874
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:08,000
Theremin!

1875
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
That's right. There's a Theremin solo on the new album.

1876
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
Woo! Theremin!

1877
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:16,000
Unfortunately, the new album isn't due out until 2013.

1878
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
So this will be a little bit of a wait.

1879
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:21,000
So I guess maybe this new track isn't for Portal 2.

1880
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:23,000
Sad face.

1881
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:26,000
I'm sure there'll be some new song from the game, though. Everybody's all crazy. Over.

1882
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:29,000
Theremin!

1883
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:30,000
Awesome.

1884
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:36,000
Maybe something with Cave Johnson singing the new character that's in the game.

1885
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:40,000
The CEO of Aperture Science or something like that.

1886
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:45,000
Which, by the way, speaking of your rant earlier, did you notice there's some bonus from getting it at GameStop?

1887
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,000
There's some unlockable character.

1888
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:52,000
Yeah, no, I've seen the commercials. It's not even an unlockable character. It's a skin for your character.

1889
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:59,000
Seriously, people, if you're all getting raging boners over a fucking skin, I'm sorry.

1890
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:03,000
But the pre-order bonuses for stuff nowadays are really kind of terrible.

1891
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:09,000
Like, you know, oh, you get this. Instead of the gun being silver, it's gold now.

1892
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,000
Whoa!

1893
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:15,000
Gold. That way all my friends know I'm a consumer whore.

1894
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,000
It's an E-peen something. I have something you don't have.

1895
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:22,000
No, it's not something that you don't have, because everybody's ordering at the same place, so they're all gonna have it.

1896
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:25,000
Okay, so I was watching South Park the other day randomly.

1897
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:28,000
It was on TV, and there was a commercial for the new Mortal Kombat.

1898
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:35,000
And it was a commercial for people at GameStop to get the new Mortal Kombat because you get the Scorpion skin, the classic Scorpion skin with it.

1899
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:38,000
And they did this whole Mashima thing with it, which was kind of funny.

1900
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
Yeah, they've been doing that now.

1901
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:46,000
But what I thought was interesting about it is that Mileena was not wearing the costume that she has in the demo.

1902
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:49,000
She was wearing classic Mileena outfits.

1903
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:53,000
So classic Scorpion outfit is not gonna be the only classic outfit that shows up in the game.

1904
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:55,000
Yes, there's a ton of them.

1905
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:57,000
Are they all gonna be download content, though?

1906
01:55:57,000 --> 01:56:03,000
No, some of them I think actually came with the... I think some come with the game.

1907
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:06,000
Like, there may be, like, a code to download one of them.

1908
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:11,000
But they're gonna be offered later on as, you know, from what I've seen in places.

1909
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:12,000
That's cool, yes.

1910
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,000
Yes, there's plenty of skins coming.

1911
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:19,000
But the new Mileena shows way more boobies than the old one did.

1912
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:23,000
And with all the gross stuff that goes on in the game, she's, like, smearing blood on her boobies.

1913
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:28,000
That's gross, but funny. That's Mortal Kombat. Mortal Kombat is funny.

1914
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:31,000
Speaking of hilarious, let's go to the email bag.

1915
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:33,000
Every week, you guys send us emails.

1916
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:37,000
Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and the hilarity ensues.

1917
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:40,000
DarkSakura, stop shopping on Steam.

1918
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,000
I'm not stopping.

1919
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
I'll never stop.

1920
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
I'll never stop shopping.

1921
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,000
Shopping's actually good for you. Did you know that?

1922
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:49,000
It's very therapeutic.

1923
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:50,000
No, it's not.

1924
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:54,000
Whenever I get pissed off, I go to the outlets. It's been $300. I feel much better.

1925
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,000
First email.

1926
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:59,000
It says, hello, O.L.R. Great show.

1927
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:01,000
I wanted to give you guys a heads up on the following.

1928
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:04,000
The Streets of Rage remake project.

1929
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,000
Yeah, we just covered this.

1930
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:09,000
It is an 8-year-old fan project by some very talented guys from Spain.

1931
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:13,000
The graphics are all redrawn, levels were upgraded or extended, and music got remixed.

1932
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:16,000
The remake is free. I'm not affiliated with these people.

1933
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:20,000
But he sent the link to it, so I figured I would link it in the chatroom.

1934
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000
Thank you, Carlos.

1935
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:27,000
Well, there you go. Another endorsement for that project that folks have been eagerly anticipating.

1936
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:30,000
Yep. And I just linked it.

1937
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:34,000
So, we only got one other email.

1938
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:38,000
Hi, O.L.R. I think this is from Spazinator.

1939
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:42,000
Since he's banned from Twitter, he's turned to the email bag.

1940
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:49,000
I just wanted to point out a couple of relatively minor stories for the three of you.

1941
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:55,000
First, there are four new free TV shows, all of which are available on both PSN as well as Xbox Live's Zune Marketplace.

1942
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:59,000
Finding them is just a matter of looking under the free TV tabs on their respective systems.

1943
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:05,000
The second story, or should I say non-story, I don't know, is that the PlayStation Network has been relatively severe-

1944
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:11,000
was having relatively severe issues this past Tuesday, while Sony has indeed acknowledged that there was an issue

1945
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:14,000
by issuing a statement via the U.S. PlayStation blog.

1946
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:17,000
They have remained rather tight-lipped about the cause of the issue.

1947
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:23,000
However, it's commonly believed that the issues with PSN were caused by a DDoS attack by a group called Anonymous, which we covered.

1948
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:30,000
I don't think that's- well, you know, to be fair, these emails come in during the week, but I don't think it's really, like, rumor.

1949
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:33,000
I'm pretty sure it's been confirmed. They did it. They took credit.

1950
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:37,000
Supposedly they're upset over the fact that Sony is taking GeoHot to court. Yes.

1951
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:41,000
If I know Loki as well as I think I do, I'll beat him to the proverbial punch and say this,

1952
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:48,000
Somebody call the WAM-bulance. Oh no, Sony is protecting their interest in suing a hacker. Waaah, I show them.

1953
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:53,000
Okay, that wasn't quite a Loki rant, but it was a reasonable approximation. I don't think so.

1954
01:58:53,000 --> 01:59:01,000
Uh, well, there's a problem with your argument, the problem being that he's not- he's hacking hardware that he owns.

1955
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:10,000
He's basically, you know, allowing himself to be able to run Linux again, or allowing himself to, you know, hack stuff.

1956
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:16,000
He's not hacking the PlayStation Network. It would be like, for example, I guess you could use the same argument that,

1957
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:26,000
Say you made a custom wallpaper or something like that for your Xbox 360, and then you popped it, you, you know, hacked it into your system so that you have a custom wallpaper,

1958
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:33,000
And then Sony- or Microsoft comes and sues you because you did that. It's basically that. The whole argument is that,

1959
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:41,000
Sony's coming after him for hacking his own hardware that he had, because they're saying that they own the system still.

1960
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:50,000
Yeah. Um, to continue, side note, I have no way to verify this either way, but supposedly anonymous has issued a statement,

1961
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:58,000
Which I will paraphrase. We wholeheartedly believe in Geohot's cause and believe he is unjustly be persecuted.

1962
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:03,000
We will fight for you until Sony relents. We will never give you up. We will never let you down. We will never run around and desert you.

1963
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:10,000
Okay, last part was BS. That was a variation of a 4chan joke, where a discussion morphs from one topic to quoting Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,

1964
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:17,000
Just that I submitted Rick Astley for Fresh Prince. This email was brought to you by Old Ass Jokes. That's it.

1965
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:25,000
Alright. That does it for emails. Unfortunately, both about topics we already covered on the show tonight,

1966
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:30,000
But hey, it's where every gamer has a voice, so send in your voices. Chances are though, if it's a big news story,

1967
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:34,000
We're probably gonna hit it at some point. You know, it is a 3 hour show. Just for the record.

1968
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:39,000
So if you're gonna email us, and that's okay, don't let that discourage you from emailing us about a big topic, a news story,

1969
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:43,000
But just tell us, what are your thoughts? Are you excited? Are you happy? Are you sad? Are you mad?

1970
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:50,000
You know, tell us what you think about it. Alright. Let's see. Let's go on to the FUs of the week.

1971
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:53,000
Every week we like to get angsty. So let's do that right now.

1972
02:00:53,000 --> 02:01:17,000
FU to my semi OCD habit of every time I get a harebrained idea, I research the crap out of it to make sure it's possible.

1973
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:29,000
And then probably don't end up doing it. This I will do. It will be done. And also an FU to lack of communication. Done.

1974
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:48,000
I hate doing this. I'm so sad about it. But FU to the squeeze in. And the reason why is because I've been looking forward to for years trying to squeeze with cheese,

1975
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:55,000
And just, you know, it looks so delicious on TV and stuff like that. I finally went to the one that they just put in in Roseville.

1976
02:01:55,000 --> 02:02:08,000
And I gotta say, that burger was fucking terrible. The cheese tasted awful. The burger had no flavor to it. It was kind of burnt tasting, the cheese.

1977
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:18,000
It was like basically having the most beautiful woman that you've ever seen describe how she's just going to make you, and you would be a virgin of course,

1978
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:25,000
Have the most amazing orgasm possible, and basically describing in great detail what she's going to do.

1979
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:26,000
Good luck with that, Hunter.

1980
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:35,000
Has you close your eyes, and then you get knocked out, left in the desert to die without any legs. That's basically what this was about.

1981
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:42,000
It's like, huh, I wasn't expecting that. That's basically, uh, Smash, or not Smash Bros.

1982
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:45,000
Oops, why is the outro to the show playing? My bad.

1983
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:51,000
It's basically, I mean, it was such a disappointment. I don't understand the draw to it at all.

1984
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:57,000
Maybe it was a bad burr or something, but, you know, everybody else seemed happy about it.

1985
02:02:57,000 --> 02:03:06,000
I could do better myself, man. I mean, if all it is is putting a lot of cheese on something. Fuck, dude, I can put a lot of cheese on something.

1986
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:17,000
Uh, my FU of the Week, wait, where'd the FU music go? There we go, thank you. Uh, my FU of the Week would go to, um, probably moving.

1987
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:23,000
I mean, like, don't get me wrong, I'm really happy to be moving, and the new place has so much more space than my old place did, so that's really good.

1988
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:30,000
Because I have a lot of shit, but my FU goes to having to move that shit is really a pain in the big fat ass.

1989
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,000
You still have to move far.

1990
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:38,000
Yeah, but it's, you still have to load up a truck and take it to the other end of the complex, so, it's not that bad.

1991
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:44,000
It's just that you have to clean the old place, and that's just a pain. It's a pain, and I'm lazy.

1992
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:45,000
Close it with fire.

1993
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:51,000
Lazy people don't like moving. I'm gonna do what I did next time I'm hiring movers again.

1994
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:58,000
When I hired movers last time, it was great. Except for the whole stuff that they weren't able to move, but, anyhow.

1995
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:06,000
Let's move on, shall we? Couple more news stories for you guys, and then, oh god, it's the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1996
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:15,000
Uh, yes, another week, another class action lawsuit. This time, it's towards EA, and I could've sworn that this hasn't been the first one, but,

1997
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:24,000
apparently there is the, um, Madden lawsuit, and it's, um, this time, it's not even necessarily just Madden, but it's EA Sports.

1998
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:35,000
Madden NCAA and Arena Football. Um, apparently that there is a case, uh, Pickover vs. Electronic Arts, Inc.

1999
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:41,000
saying that EA's exclusive licenses foreclosed competition in an alleged football video game market.

2000
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:47,000
Because of the lack of competition, the plaintiffs in the case claimed that this monopoly allowed EA to overcharge for its games,

2001
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:52,000
even though EA Sports games, of course, cost as much as, you know, all the other console games out there.

2002
02:04:52,000 --> 02:05:04,000
Um, so, if you're interested in possibly participating in this, you can go to easportslitigation.com, and check out the information regarding that.

2003
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:12,000
Apparently, this would qualify if you bought a game between, or an EA Sports football game, uh, between 2005 and now.

2004
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:22,000
Yeah, XLink was telling me about this, because I guess he got an email about it on WoW, and there was a part of me that was kind of like,

2005
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,000
is this like a phishing thing, or is this, now I guess it is a real deal.

2006
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:25,000
No, it's real.

2007
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:26,000
Class action lawsuit.

2008
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:33,000
You know, they give the options, you know, you can remain a class member, and it says you need, you do not need to take any further action at this time,

2009
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:40,000
you'll automatically remain a class member, and, uh, or you can exclude yourself, and do all that stuff.

2010
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:47,000
It's, I've seen this a lot, like, I got one from 24 Hour Fitness one time, and I got like, it was crap, it was like,

2011
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:50,000
ooh, you get three weeks free, it's like, I don't want to go back there.

2012
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
Whoops, excuse me.

2013
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:58,000
I'm having a lot of technical fail tonight, I apologize for that.

2014
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:03,000
Well, I'm surprised, Rob, this episode's supposed to be squeaky clean.

2015
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:06,000
I know, it's 4-9, it's really broken and dirty.

2016
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:09,000
Alright, well since I already played a part of it, let me play it here.

2017
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:14,000
I had no idea this was, uh, in the DVD, is this in the Tron Legacy DVD?

2018
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:21,000
There's an ad for the new Commodore 64, I guess, that is coming out, because it's this whole Tron thing,

2019
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:28,000
it talks about, you know, more colors and better sound and so forth, and then all of a sudden...

2020
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,000
I didn't see that.

2021
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:33,000
And we watched, like, a bunch of stuff.

2022
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:37,000
And there's a whole Commodore computer coming out.

2023
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:43,000
Now, we talked about this on the show before, that the Commodore 64 is being rebooted.

2024
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:46,000
Maybe that was something special they did for you, I don't know.

2025
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:48,000
It's probably like a TV commercial or something.

2026
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:50,000
Perhaps, but this is still awesome.

2027
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:52,000
CommodoreUSA.net, if you want to get it.

2028
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:54,000
They are Commodore PCs.

2029
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:58,000
The Commodore 64, the pricing is announced, that's what's made these big.

2030
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:01,000
The Commodore 64 is going to start at $595 US dollars,

2031
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:08,000
the VIC Pro will be $895 US dollars, and the VIC Slim will be $395 US dollars.

2032
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:11,000
Now, it doesn't quite say exactly what all is coming with these.

2033
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:13,000
Let me see if the website has more details on this.

2034
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:18,000
It's an Intel Atom processor, so think Netbook.

2035
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:21,000
Aw, that kind of sucks, if that's the case.

2036
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:23,000
Okay, yay, you're showing me the damn preview again.

2037
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:25,000
Let me see here, let me go to the site.

2038
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:32,000
Think Netbook and think, you know, it's going to have an emulator for Commodore games on there.

2039
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:37,000
Let's see, the classic recreated Commodore 64, one 12 volt DC jack,

2040
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:44,000
one PS2 keyboard mouse connectors, one HDMI, one DVI-D, one VGA, four USB slots.

2041
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,000
Go to the tech configurations.

2042
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:51,000
Let's see, technology, processor, Intel Atom, oh boy.

2043
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:53,000
What's 1.8 gigahertz?

2044
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:58,000
I can guarantee you right there, those boards, because they're all integrated boards,

2045
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:03,000
they go for about maybe $200 at the most.

2046
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:06,000
That sucks, because I'll tell you what, I'm not even going to lie,

2047
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:09,000
I really want one of these, because I love my Commodore 64,

2048
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:12,000
and this is what they're selling it on to.

2049
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:14,000
You can seriously build one of those cheaper than that.

2050
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:16,000
I know, I know.

2051
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:22,000
Yeah, the Realtek audio that's built in, the Ethernet's all built into the stupid board.

2052
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:29,000
Do they even include anything else other than how much RAM was in it again?

2053
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:33,000
Two DDR2s up to four gigs.

2054
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:36,000
Two single channel slots, yeah.

2055
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:42,000
DDR2, old slow ass RAM compared to nowadays stuff.

2056
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:47,000
Let me see what's in that VIC Pro, because I guess there's the VIC Pro that's coming out as well.

2057
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:49,000
See, but this doesn't have that same nostalgia factor for me.

2058
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:54,000
See, that's a little bit different though. See, this one actually has a dual or quad core processor built into it.

2059
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:57,000
So, that's a little bit better.

2060
02:08:57,000 --> 02:08:59,000
Intel dual or quad.

2061
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:03,000
How big was the Commodore 64 keyboard? Was that pretty big?

2062
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:07,000
Well, they were monsters because the computer was inside the keyboard.

2063
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:09,000
So they were pretty big keyboards.

2064
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:12,000
I don't understand why they can't fit a bigger, better computer in there.

2065
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:14,000
Well, it's probably the price.

2066
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:18,000
They're trying to, obviously they want to profit off these.

2067
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:22,000
Yeah, but I mean, hell, when I was building my MAME cabinet stuff,

2068
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:25,000
I mean, they're like dual core Intel chips.

2069
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:33,000
It's like dual core 2.8 gigahertz chips with 2 gigs of RAM and decent hard drive and stuff.

2070
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:35,000
And I built those under $200.

2071
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:38,000
So, they can't do that?

2072
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:43,000
I mean, and that's, you know, hell, you could probably find that stuff even cheaper.

2073
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:49,000
Especially if you're like Commodore or somebody making a massive amount of computers.

2074
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:53,000
I mean, you're not just a consumer like myself.

2075
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:55,000
I don't know.

2076
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:58,000
But, yeah, whatever. You're paying for nostalgia.

2077
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:01,000
Maybe licensing for Commodore.

2078
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:02,000
Alright.

2079
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:05,000
Maybe having to remake those computers.

2080
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:07,000
Well, probably it's nostalgia.

2081
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:09,000
It's the original emulator.

2082
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:11,000
They're trying to get some value out of that too.

2083
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:13,000
You know, obviously they want to make a profit off it,

2084
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:22,000
but they want to cash in on old folks like me who have the nostalgia going with the Commodore 64.

2085
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:23,000
That's what it is.

2086
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:24,000
Alright, let's go to the Skype line.

2087
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:26,000
Every week we open up the Skype line.

2088
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:32,000
Take your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR or use the name on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2089
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:34,000
The Skype line is open now.

2090
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:37,000
We're going to have to wait a minute and a half for the chat room to hear that.

2091
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:40,000
Well, we could also post in the chat room.

2092
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:41,000
I'm going to do that right now.

2093
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:42,000
Send call now.

2094
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:43,000
Yeah.

2095
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:46,000
Loki, go ahead and read us some last minute stories while I post that.

2096
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:50,000
Sony has thought of a great idea for the PlayStation Move.

2097
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:52,000
Hey, you know what sells more Move?

2098
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:53,000
More iPad.

2099
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:54,000
That's right.

2100
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:57,000
There's an iPad sequel coming out because, you know, the first one wasn't terrible enough.

2101
02:10:57,000 --> 02:11:01,000
So this iPad sequel comes with Friends.

2102
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:05,000
That's where you'll be able to have two players and two iPads at the same time.

2103
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:08,000
You can be able to create your own content as well.

2104
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:13,000
They're saying that, I guess, you can either raise one up by itself or raise them as a pair.

2105
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:15,000
I mean, I'm sorry.

2106
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:21,000
It was a neat idea at first when it was supposed to be for the PlayStation Eye, but it was pretty terrible when it came out.

2107
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:25,000
I can't be too excited about that, unfortunately.

2108
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:28,000
And then this is kind of interesting.

2109
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:34,000
Remember how the PlayStation 1 emulator got removed from the Android Marketplace?

2110
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:37,000
Well, not to be outdone by that.

2111
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:45,000
The PSX for Droid application is back, and actually it's available now from the developer's website.

2112
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:52,000
It says the original Sony complaint only had to do with the trademark logo that he had put on the app's icon.

2113
02:11:52,000 --> 02:12:02,000
But since then, I guess, Google has closed both his Android Market and Checkout accounts, so he's leaving him unable to publish any apps.

2114
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:04,000
So he's self-publishing the app now.

2115
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:15,000
So if you want to download the free app and then go find your ISOs, you can do that and avoid paying $7 per PlayStation 1 game.

2116
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:18,000
God, I love that stuff.

2117
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,000
And then finally, this is kind of cool.

2118
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:24,000
Well, Evil Dead, they're making a game now for the iPhone and iPad.

2119
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:28,000
It's going to be a 3D action shooter.

2120
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:35,000
It's supposed to be coming out very soon, and it kind of features these chibi characters.

2121
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:49,000
Chibi, Bruce Campbell, and it's supposed to be out for, I guess, $2.99 on the iPhone, $4.99 on the iPad, and 30 chapters, and I guess lots of stuff.

2122
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:53,000
It looked like the movie, but very chibi.

2123
02:12:53,000 --> 02:13:07,000
And then I guess it's being developed by Trigger Apps, who's made a bunch of different movie-based games for the iPhone and Android, including The Karate Kid, Green Hornet, G.I. Joe, and Couples Retreat.

2124
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:10,000
That Couples Retreat looked like a terrible movie.

2125
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:11,000
No, it looks really terrible.

2126
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:12,000
What's that?

2127
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:13,000
The Guvenator.

2128
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:15,000
Oh, God.

2129
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:16,000
Seriously.

2130
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:19,000
I saw you post that story, and I was like, no, we're not covering that.

2131
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:21,000
I guess we are now, but that's alright.

2132
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:23,000
It looks so terrible.

2133
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:25,000
Why would you, why would they do this?

2134
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:27,000
Apparently, Stan Lee is putting out a comic.

2135
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:31,000
I guess Stan Lee has no cred anymore, because he's putting out the Guvenator now.

2136
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:33,000
Way to ruin your reputation there, bud.

2137
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:43,000
So they put out a comic, and of course they're doing a cartoon series, and apparently that cartoon series is going to become a movie, and possibly a game.

2138
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:49,000
And Arnold Schwarzenegger is doing The Voice, and I don't get it.

2139
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:50,000
It looks stupid.

2140
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:52,000
It looks so cheesy.

2141
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:56,000
But that's what they're doing.

2142
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:59,000
That's the best idea.

2143
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:05,000
Gosh, our Skype line is really lagged tonight, and it's making me sad, but we're talking in the chat room about Commodore 64.

2144
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:12,000
Because Ziba in our chat room is saying, you know, it just emulates the games, and there's nothing like having an original Commodore 64 play the games.

2145
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:13,000
I'm like, you know what, you're right.

2146
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:16,000
I need to just go find an original Commodore 64 that still works.

2147
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,000
There might be one in my parents' garage, actually.

2148
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,000
I don't know if the damn thing would still work.

2149
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:24,000
But yeah, it just had me reminiscing.

2150
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:29,000
Seriously, I want to go back and play Dragon's Lair 2 on the Commodore 64 so bad.

2151
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:32,000
It's one of my favorite soundtracks ever, and I know I've brought this up on the show before.

2152
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:36,000
But it was not the actual Dragon's Lair 2 that was the arcade game.

2153
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:38,000
This was called Escape from Singe's Castle.

2154
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:45,000
I think I brought this up when Dark Sakura did this as the classic game of the week once, but one of my favorite soundtracks ever on the Commodore 64.

2155
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:49,000
It was Escape from Singe's Castle. It was like the second half of the scenes.

2156
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:56,000
But the thing about the Commodore 64 version of Dragon's Lair is that it wasn't, like they couldn't make the laserdisc, obviously.

2157
02:14:56,000 --> 02:15:00,000
So they had to make little mini-games out of all the scenes.

2158
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:07,000
So like this one was a rowing game where you had to push the joystick in the direction that the tide was going.

2159
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:09,000
So it was like a reaction type thing.

2160
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:15,000
But then one of the coolest stages, the coolest music is the, um, yes, this one with the balls in the tunnel.

2161
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,000
And he had to jump over the holes in the floor.

2162
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,000
And he had to, it was a very tricky balance.

2163
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:28,000
You can see how he keeps moving forward slightly.

2164
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:31,000
It's because if you let it keep going, he'll just fall off the back.

2165
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:33,000
And he slips and falls.

2166
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:38,000
And then there's some random scenes that are inspired by the actual arcade game.

2167
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,000
Let me see if I can get to one of those.

2168
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:45,000
See like this is, the hand's coming up so he has to jump left. Things like that.

2169
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:50,000
This arcade, this was like one of my favorite Commodore 64 games. It was so awesome.

2170
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:54,000
Anyhow, just taking a trip down memory lane. That's all.

2171
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:56,000
Any other last minute stories while no one calls?

2172
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:57,000
Um, yeah.

2173
02:15:57,000 --> 02:15:58,000
I like to party.

2174
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:05,000
There's a new, um, new indie game coming out on the Xbox marketplace called Avatar Legends.

2175
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:10,000
It's going to be a role playing game, I guess by the developer Barker's Crest.

2176
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:13,000
And it actually looks kind of cool.

2177
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:17,000
It's going to be a 10 hour single player game. Co-op and multiplayer for up to six people.

2178
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:19,000
A level and quest editor.

2179
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:21,000
And you can create missions to share with your friends.

2180
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:24,000
But you also, you play as your avatar.

2181
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:26,000
And you actually get full control over them and stuff.

2182
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:27,000
So that kind of looks neat.

2183
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:38,000
And, um, I guess this says you can even drop people from your friends list into the game's NPC and set up, I guess, like different multiplayer and stuff.

2184
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:42,000
Who the hell's calling me? Who's calling you? Don't they know you have a show?

2185
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:43,000
Unless it's the wife.

2186
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:44,000
My wife.

2187
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:45,000
Uh oh.

2188
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:50,000
Alright, so Loki's taking a phone call. And we're not. So...

2189
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:53,000
I'm going to the Mii festival on Saturday.

2190
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:54,000
What's the Mii festival?

2191
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:55,000
Sakura Matsuri.

2192
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:57,000
Ah, what goes on at the Sakura Matsuri festival?

2193
02:16:57,000 --> 02:16:59,000
It's where everyone has a parade in my honor.

2194
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:00,000
Oh really?

2195
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:01,000
Yeah, not really.

2196
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:02,000
No, I don't think that's why they're doing the parade.

2197
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:07,000
It's because the cherry blossoms are in bloom.

2198
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:09,000
Okay, is everything okay?

2199
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:11,000
Yeah, apparently. She's like, I'm going to call you back and leave a message.

2200
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:13,000
Oh, okay. Phew.

2201
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:18,000
I thought, she's never called during the show before. And I was like, oh, emergency. So, but I guess it's not that bad.

2202
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:21,000
Oh no, the baby have started to move.

2203
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:25,000
That could be it. Maybe the baby's getting a little more mobile. Who knows?

2204
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:27,000
How are things going with the baby?

2205
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:32,000
Uh, he's doing okay. He's wiggly.

2206
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:41,000
Wants to roll around and not sleep. And he acts like he's teething, but there's nothing really coming in.

2207
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:44,000
So, I don't know. We took him to the park today.

2208
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:48,000
And uh, that's pretty much it.

2209
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:53,000
Alright, we're finally getting some calls. Let's go to the phone and take them. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

2210
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:55,000
Hi, guys. This is DDR.Bill.

2211
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:59,000
Wow, he's really quiet. Is it just, let me check your levels. I don't know if it's just here in the studio.

2212
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:01,000
How are you doing, DDR.Bill?

2213
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:04,000
Oh, doing alright. Just figured I'd give a call and say hi.

2214
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:10,000
Hi. You are kind of quiet, but I think we can deal. You're not like, unhearable. What's up? What's on your mind?

2215
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:20,000
Uh, nothing. I was trying to find a topic to talk about because I didn't want to call and turn into a bitchfest about Killer Instinct because I absolutely hated that game with that furious passion.

2216
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:26,000
Hey, you know what? It's where every gamer has a voice, so some of us like Killer Instinct. Why do you hate Killer Instinct?

2217
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:42,000
This was back when I started developing a real hatred of fighting games, especially with something like Killer Instinct where it was just memorizing bullshit amount of combos to the point of where my physics exam was easier than Killer Instinct.

2218
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:57,000
But what about the whole, and I don't know if this is just Killer Instinct 2, but I thought Killer Instinct 1 had this too, where if you kind of just knew like the basics, like you know, the cross, the X pattern, and you know, you could do some pretty decent combos just knowing the patterns.

2219
02:18:57,000 --> 02:19:04,000
Like it wasn't like Mortal Kombat, dude. Like Mortal Kombat 3, you really had to memorize combos in order to get through that game. You know what I mean?

2220
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:15,000
Like it was to the point where when I fired up Mortal Kombat 3 on Xbox last week, I still remembered like a seven-hit cabal combo just because I had to memorize it like 10 years ago, you know?

2221
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:22,000
Yeah, for Mortal Kombat 3, I'll agree with that because I've only memorized one character, and that was Sindel.

2222
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:31,000
Dude, Sindel was awesome. Yes, it was like low kick, low kick, high punch, high punch, uppercut. Yeah, I used to know all the stuff for Sindel too. She was awesome.

2223
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:35,000
Yeah, and that was the only count I played. I was like, eh, whatever.

2224
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:44,000
They had some really dopey fatalities in Mortal Kombat 3 though. Like it wasn't one of her fatalities where like she whips them in her, like she literally whips her hair back and forth.

2225
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:54,000
Like she whips them up in a little like ice cream cone looking thing and then whips her hair back and it just, it unravels the body and all the bones go flying. Like it's really stupid.

2226
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:57,000
Like Mortal Kombat 3 was when it got really cartoony, you know what I mean?

2227
02:19:57,000 --> 02:20:03,000
Yeah, especially when her second one was when she screamed and your skin just came off. I was like, okay.

2228
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:05,000
Yeah, yeah.

2229
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:11,000
Yeah, but there's also, the thing also was that this came out also the same time around as the Virtua Fighter series coming out.

2230
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:22,000
And Virtua Fighter, what I loved about that over things like Killer Instinct and even Street Fighter was it just felt more natural to play. Like it just, everything felt better at the time.

2231
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:33,000
Like I really felt like I was actually, for the time I felt like, oh wow, my moves actually carried out. It made sense, not just memorizing combos and X, Y, Z, magic pattern, whatever.

2232
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:34,000
Right.

2233
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:38,000
You know, that's why I kind of had a really big dislike for it.

2234
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:47,000
That and I got into a fistfight over some jackass in my college who, there was a whole stupid argument about it and I ended up punching him.

2235
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:49,000
You got into a fistfight over this?

2236
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:56,000
Yeah, cause he was like, he got to remember also that this kid was acting all bullshit gangster.

2237
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:58,000
In other words, he had it coming.

2238
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:03,000
I was like shut up and back and forth and then she just like punched him and walked away.

2239
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:09,000
Wow, have you ever gotten in a physical altercation over a video game? Dark Soccer, have you ever punched some bitch over a video game?

2240
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:11,000
I punched my brother.

2241
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:12,000
Did you really?

2242
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:17,000
Yeah, cause we were playing Super Street Fighter IV, not four, why am I saying four, Super Street Fighter II.

2243
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:24,000
When my brothers were still younger and he totally, totally, totally tried to grab my controller so I punched him.

2244
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:25,000
Wow.

2245
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:26,000
Oh damn.

2246
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:29,000
Well you know, it's the bitch let go of my controller.

2247
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:33,000
But you've never punched another girl over a video game?

2248
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:35,000
I didn't know any other girls that played.

2249
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:38,000
And then you hit them with pillows and then rub your boobies together.

2250
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:41,000
No, I always played with dudes.

2251
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:42,000
Oh okay.

2252
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:43,000
But I punched them too.

2253
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:45,000
And they thought it was funny.

2254
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:51,000
I've always thought my coworkers are gonna do that to me during Grand Theft Auto cause I really piss them off when I play with them.

2255
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:52,000
But uh, no.

2256
02:21:52,000 --> 02:22:00,000
Yeah, I don't think I've ever gotten in a physical altercation over a video game. Like I think, you know, I've thrown controllers and I've probably thrown controllers at people.

2257
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:02,000
Well my mother tried to take away my Nintendo once.

2258
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:03,000
Oh god, I love this story.

2259
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:10,000
And then she was gonna, gonna spank me because I uh, I got it out of the closet until I reminded her that she didn't buy it for me and that it was theft.

2260
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:11,000
Whoops.

2261
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:14,000
I was, no, I was seriously a little hellion.

2262
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:16,000
Mother, there is condensation on the window.

2263
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:18,000
That's my favorite story your mother told.

2264
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:20,000
When I was three.

2265
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:23,000
I just had a good vocabulary.

2266
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:24,000
Okay.

2267
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:26,000
So did I. I don't feel bad.

2268
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:28,000
Sorry, I think we got off track a little bit DDR dollar bill.

2269
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:32,000
Somehow we went to fist fight to condensation on the windows. That's okay.

2270
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:33,000
It's alright.

2271
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:40,000
And then the second thing also what got me, what I also wanted to talk about was that you were talking about the love of Commodore 64 games.

2272
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:41,000
Yes.

2273
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:51,000
That actually what got me started into emulation because I never actually played a Commodore until they actually started emulating the games, you know, I'd say the mid 90s.

2274
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:52,000
Mmhmm.

2275
02:22:52,000 --> 02:23:01,000
And that's when I really started getting into it and the strangest thing was I actually was collecting magazines from England about Commodore games.

2276
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:08,000
Well cause the Commodore 64 was huge over there. I mean I would like to think it was pretty big in the US but it was huge in the UK. Huge.

2277
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:14,000
Oh definitely. The two magazines were The Games Machine and Zzap! 64.

2278
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:15,000
Mmhmm.

2279
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:25,000
And it was through those magazines that I actually downloaded a few games and that's when I found two of my all time favorite freaking soundtracks as you were saying.

2280
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:32,000
Like you said Dragon Slayer Escape Ninja Slave was a good soundtrack and I'm agreeing with that one. It was really cool.

2281
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:33,000
Uh huh. What else though?

2282
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:36,000
But my favorite all time? Last Ninja 2.

2283
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:41,000
Dude the last Ninja, those were some awesome games. Yeah.

2284
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:42,000
Yeah.

2285
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:43,000
Absolutely.

2286
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:45,000
The second one though the music was just oh my god phenomenal.

2287
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:54,000
Let's see if we can get some of the music here from this game. I don't know if we, this is some game play video so I don't know how much, I can't remember how much soundtrack was in the actual game. Let's see if we can get to here.

2288
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:58,000
The first one was my favorite, Central Park, the first level. That was really good.

2289
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:01,000
Okay let's see what we can do here.

2290
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:05,000
Trying to play some of the music here from it.

2291
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:09,000
Nah this thing's like muted or something.

2292
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:10,000
Oh damn.

2293
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:14,000
Well there's Amiga, let's see this Amiga version here. Let's see.

2294
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:23,000
That's a different, that sounds a lot different.

2295
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:27,000
Yeah that's the Amiga version. Hold on let me see if we have the Commodore 64 one.

2296
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:29,000
Commodore 64 long play part one.

2297
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:31,000
Here we go.

2298
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:37,000
Ah yes, this is what I remember too.

2299
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:40,000
Let's fast forward a little bit.

2300
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:48,000
There's like a whole cinematic opening.

2301
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:50,000
Oh this is The Last Ninja 3. My bad.

2302
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:55,000
Oh, I'm trying to be actually. I'm trying one too.

2303
02:24:55,000 --> 02:24:58,000
Same type of thing though. Yeah they all had epic soundtracks though.

2304
02:24:58,000 --> 02:24:59,000
Oh definitely.

2305
02:24:59,000 --> 02:25:00,000
Awesome.

2306
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:04,000
I actually grabbed someone, there was a group, I think it was Puffy64.

2307
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:10,000
That actually remixed the soundtrack from the second one and added some rock in it.

2308
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:13,000
I was like, I used that as my wrestling theme now for SmackDown vs Raw.

2309
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:18,000
So you said there's one other Commodore 64 game you had a great soundtrack?

2310
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:20,000
Usagi Yojimbo.

2311
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:22,000
I don't even know this one.

2312
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:27,000
That's like from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles right?

2313
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:29,000
Yes, they actually had a game for it.

2314
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:35,000
Cool. I liked that character. I liked that he actually did a separate comic for him.

2315
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:41,000
Let's see, there actually is a video here on the YouTubes.

2316
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:44,000
Oh, this is the rabbit samurai thing.

2317
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:46,000
Yeah, Usagi Yojimbo.

2318
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:52,000
Oh, got it.

2319
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:55,000
I love this song.

2320
02:25:55,000 --> 02:25:58,000
There you go. Alright, very cool.

2321
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:02,000
People are still using Commodore 64s to make music, it's awesome.

2322
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:14,000
I know, and it's like when you think about the way, the fact that it has about, it's supposedly about the same hardware I'm going to say as Nintendo, but they did a lot more than music, it just blows my mind apart.

2323
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:15,000
Absolutely.

2324
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:21,000
Alright, well, DDR Dollar Bill, we're going to let you go to try to take at least one more call here, but have a good one, okay buddy?

2325
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:22,000
You too, thanks a lot guys.

2326
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:27,000
Alright, thanks for the reminiscing of the Commodore 64 classics, and don't get into any more fistfights over a game.

2327
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:29,000
I'll try not to.

2328
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:31,000
Alright, later.

2329
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:37,000
Wow, you know, I believe that the kids fought over video games a long time ago, but I don't remember.

2330
02:26:37,000 --> 02:26:42,000
You know, I played a lot of Street Fighter in the arcade, but I don't remember ever getting into a fistfight over it.

2331
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:44,000
I remember a lot of trash talking.

2332
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:48,000
Alright, any other last minute stories that we got going on tonight?

2333
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:49,000
No.

2334
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:52,000
Oh shit. Uh oh.

2335
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:53,000
Huh?

2336
02:26:53,000 --> 02:26:54,000
I'm out of things to talk about.

2337
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:56,000
Call us people, dammit!

2338
02:26:56,000 --> 02:27:03,000
Well, it's a minute and a half delay, so I posted it in chat, but it's going to take time before somebody gets through here.

2339
02:27:03,000 --> 02:27:08,000
We're going to need to have like a list of things to talk about when the phones are dead, or something.

2340
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:12,000
Well, I've been doing a little bit of research, Rob, while we've been waiting for calls.

2341
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:15,000
And if, did we get a call yesterday?

2342
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:18,000
Yes, we got a call, so thank god. We'll come back to your thought, though, after this.

2343
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:20,000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

2344
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:21,000
Ziba!

2345
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:23,000
Ziba! How are you, my friend?

2346
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:27,000
I'm doing good. I heard you guys talk about Commodore 64 a lot. I just wanted to give an update.

2347
02:27:27,000 --> 02:27:30,000
Of course we were, because it's awesome.

2348
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:38,000
Remember when I called, I think it was before Christmas, or after Christmas or something, and I said I bought my boyfriend a Commodore 64?

2349
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:44,000
Yes, yes I do, because I remember telling you you were like the best girlfriend ever for doing that. Yes, I do.

2350
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:54,000
And then you guys told me I should look for something that will allow me to kind of use a flash card almost to play some games and do some stuff, but I actually did find something.

2351
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:56,000
Oh, what did you find?

2352
02:27:56,000 --> 02:28:12,000
It's called UIEC. It's actually a, I guess this little SD card holder, and you actually hook it up to where the floppy drive hooks up to in the back of the Commodore.

2353
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:18,000
And then you're actually able to put an SD card in it and save, just like a floppy drive.

2354
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:20,000
Oh my god, that sounds awesome!

2355
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:32,000
And it actually comes with its own firmware and all this stuff, and you can go online and get the hacked ROMs or whatever, the games, and you actually can put it on there and play them.

2356
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:47,000
But it's really hard because it's really hard to find ones that actually work, because like you said, the Commodore 64 was really big in the UK and all those places in Europe, because it still is.

2357
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:50,000
It still is? You know, I believe it.

2358
02:28:50,000 --> 02:29:04,000
There's actually conventions in Europe that actually, there's a lot of demo scenes now that people are still coding on this thing and making their own little demo scenes.

2359
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:16,000
And some people do some really awesome stuff, and I've been trying to download some and play them, because you can do that too, but you can't play PAL demo scenes on a US Commodore.

2360
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:32,000
So I'm actually thinking about getting a PAL Commodore 64 just so I can play games in the right speed, because you can still play PAL games, but they play really fast because of the Hertz difference and stuff, whatever.

2361
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:44,000
But we're really enjoying it. My boyfriend has been coding and experimenting, and I just bought a joystick and I've been trying to play some games.

2362
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:46,000
But we're still loving it, even today.

2363
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:49,000
So what's one of the games on the Commodore 64 that you enjoy right now?

2364
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:51,000
Cybernoid 2.

2365
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:58,000
I remember Cybernoid. They made an NES port of the original one, and it's not as good as the Commodore 64 one, to be honest.

2366
02:29:58,000 --> 02:30:10,000
I really like the music and just, you know, shooting little, like, I don't even know what the monsters are called, because they're just like these little, I don't know, blobs.

2367
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:12,000
But it's really fun. I really like it.

2368
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:16,000
Let's see, I got a little bit of the gameplay here of Cybernoid 2.

2369
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:19,000
This game was hard, too.

2370
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:27,000
But there's lots of cheats that it came with, so you can still play with it, but it's really fun.

2371
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:33,000
You know why the Commodore 64 was so awesome is because it was a little bit ahead of its time in the fact that you could hook it up to a TV.

2372
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:41,000
And so a lot of you didn't have to buy a separate monitor for it, and I think that was part of what really drove it, is that it was kind of like a gaming console computer.

2373
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:48,000
I mean, oh god, whenever I think of the 80s, I think of my Commodore 64, and just like, having that made me the nerd I am.

2374
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:50,000
It really did.

2375
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:54,000
We actually did have a hard time hooking up to TVs in here.

2376
02:30:54,000 --> 02:31:00,000
First, I was trying to use a Nintendo RF adapter, which didn't work very well.

2377
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:05,000
So then I went online and I bought some cables, and it worked, but it was all black and white.

2378
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:08,000
So I was going crazy trying to find something.

2379
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:18,000
Finally, I went to Radio Shack and I got this adapter, and this little small adapter that allowed me to put a cable wire in it, and then hook it up to the TV that way.

2380
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:27,000
But even, I was reading online, people were having lots of trouble putting it on a LCD TV because of the difference.

2381
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:28,000
Oh sure.

2382
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:30,000
I guess, yeah, since the TVs are new.

2383
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:31,000
Oh sure, I bet.

2384
02:31:31,000 --> 02:31:44,000
You know, and the old, from what I remember, I actually had a Commodore 64 monitor, and what I remember of those cables, they were a little different because there were two video cable inputs and one audio.

2385
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:48,000
And most RCA, the red, yellow, white, are two audio and one video.

2386
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:53,000
And I think that's why a lot of people get black and white when they try to hook it up, is because of that.

2387
02:31:53,000 --> 02:32:01,000
So, yeah, but I guess, I'm sure with this still being popular to develop today, people are figuring it out, you know?

2388
02:32:01,000 --> 02:32:04,000
So, alright.

2389
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:06,000
Alright, well thank you so much for the call, Ziba.

2390
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:07,000
No problem.

2391
02:32:07,000 --> 02:32:10,000
Is there anything else you want to get out there before we let you go so we can get more calls?

2392
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:11,000
No, that's it.

2393
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:13,000
Alright, take care my friend.

2394
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:14,000
Alright, bye bye.

2395
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:15,000
Bye.

2396
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:21,000
Alright, I guess we'll let there be one more call here before we wrap things up.

2397
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:23,000
I'm excited to chat again to see if that will work.

2398
02:32:23,000 --> 02:32:28,000
Meanwhile, while we wait for that to come in, DarkSakura, what were we talking about a minute ago?

2399
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:29,000
You were gonna...

2400
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:30,000
I'm actually...

2401
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:31,000
Oh, your project.

2402
02:32:31,000 --> 02:32:34,000
Yeah, I'm actually looking into logic board replacement.

2403
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:35,000
Really?

2404
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:43,000
Yeah, because you can't replace the processor because it's soldered into the logic board.

2405
02:32:43,000 --> 02:32:46,000
But you can replace the logic board with the processor on it.

2406
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:56,000
So, I'm actually now... my goal is to still get the, you know, OSX working and everything.

2407
02:32:56,000 --> 02:33:00,000
But this is actually turning out to be a little bit more fun than I thought it was gonna be.

2408
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:06,000
Because I can actually get a new logic board for about 100 bucks.

2409
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:08,000
Alright, let's go to the phones. We have another call coming in.

2410
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:10,000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

2411
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:11,000
Hey guys.

2412
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:12,000
Hey.

2413
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:13,000
I just know who it is.

2414
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:14,000
This is DDR Angel, isn't it?

2415
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:15,000
Hi.

2416
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:18,000
Holy moly, I haven't heard from you in forever.

2417
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:21,000
Well, I mean, I've seen you on Twitter and all that, some Facebook and all that.

2418
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:25,000
But I mean, having you on OLR, this is like old school.

2419
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:31,000
I remember, wasn't the first episode you ever came to of OLR episode 20?

2420
02:33:31,000 --> 02:33:32,000
I think it was.

2421
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:33,000
Something like that.

2422
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:34,000
Or like 22.

2423
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:38,000
It was really... it was when OLR expanded from a two-hour show to a three-hour show officially.

2424
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:39,000
I remember that.

2425
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:41,000
Actually, it was when you were in that big house. I don't remember.

2426
02:33:41,000 --> 02:33:42,000
That was like 2003 or something.

2427
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:43,000
It was a long time ago.

2428
02:33:43,000 --> 02:33:45,000
I think we've had like seven different studios since then.

2429
02:33:45,000 --> 02:33:48,000
Yeah, that was when I lived with a guy named Brian.

2430
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:49,000
That was many years ago.

2431
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:50,000
Yes.

2432
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:51,000
Ten years ago.

2433
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:52,000
Yep.

2434
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:53,000
Crazy stuff.

2435
02:33:53,000 --> 02:33:55,000
I just called because the Skype line was open.

2436
02:33:55,000 --> 02:33:57,000
I didn't really have anything I wanted to say.

2437
02:33:57,000 --> 02:33:58,000
Well, you're lucky.

2438
02:33:58,000 --> 02:34:07,000
It's funny because now that people realize it's open, we're getting hammered with like five people all at once.

2439
02:34:07,000 --> 02:34:09,000
And I feel bad because some people can't get through.

2440
02:34:09,000 --> 02:34:10,000
But we'll see.

2441
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:14,000
Well, DDR Angel, I know you didn't have a whole lot. You just want to kind of say hi.

2442
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:19,000
But for those that are new to OLR, believe it or not, we're still here, as you can hear.

2443
02:34:19,000 --> 02:34:23,000
And we have a lot of people that we've picked up since the podcasting era.

2444
02:34:23,000 --> 02:34:29,000
When we switched to podcasting, we gained a whole lot of new listeners because you didn't have to be here live Sunday every week to listen.

2445
02:34:29,000 --> 02:34:31,000
But I know you've been listening to tonight's show.

2446
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:35,000
What's kind of different about OLR than the way it used to be?

2447
02:34:35,000 --> 02:34:41,000
Well, to me, there's a lot of old stuff that's still there.

2448
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:43,000
So, you know, the main part of the show is still there.

2449
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:46,000
And I didn't see too much of a difference.

2450
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:50,000
But, I mean, you guys do have, you know, a lot of other segments and stuff that you add in.

2451
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:54,000
So it's just old LRR still being there.

2452
02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:57,000
But, you know, you just have your new segments too, which I like.

2453
02:34:57,000 --> 02:35:00,000
So it's all good. I mean, I don't know.

2454
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:01,000
Awesome.

2455
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:06,000
Well, anything else about the olden OLR days you want to enlighten these new kids with?

2456
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:10,000
Cake pie. No, wait. You guys already did that.

2457
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:12,000
Old school jokes.

2458
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:14,000
We were joking about all that old stuff earlier.

2459
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:15,000
Yeah.

2460
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:20,000
So now, for those that are kind of catching up on lost time, you know, you used to come to the show as a guest quite often.

2461
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:21,000
Yes.

2462
02:35:21,000 --> 02:35:27,000
Now, I remember you used to play a game called Here? Was that what it was called?

2463
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:28,000
Oh, There.

2464
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:29,000
There.

2465
02:35:29,000 --> 02:35:30,000
Yeah.

2466
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:31,000
Very close.

2467
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:32,000
Close. Very close.

2468
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:33,000
Are you still involved?

2469
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:34,000
They had to shut down.

2470
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:36,000
Yeah, they had to shut down. Right. I remember that.

2471
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:39,000
So sadly you're not. But you were with them right up until the very end, right?

2472
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:40,000
Yes.

2473
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:41,000
Awesome.

2474
02:35:41,000 --> 02:35:42,000
Gotcha. Gotcha.

2475
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:46,000
And I believe you got married since the last time you were here?

2476
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:49,000
Yeah, I did actually.

2477
02:35:49,000 --> 02:36:00,000
Somebody from the Balmany community a long time ago that used to come into the chat room by the name of Ohio BRP Balmany or whatever.

2478
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:01,000
Uh-huh.

2479
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:02,000
Yeah.

2480
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:04,000
I don't remember his name actually.

2481
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:05,000
Big Red Pimp?

2482
02:36:05,000 --> 02:36:06,000
Yes, Big Red Pimp.

2483
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:08,000
It was a long time ago. There you go.

2484
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:10,000
So you guys actually ended up getting married?

2485
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:11,000
Yep.

2486
02:36:11,000 --> 02:36:12,000
Congratulations.

2487
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:13,000
Thank you.

2488
02:36:13,000 --> 02:36:15,000
Are you still here in California? You moved out to Ohio, didn't you?

2489
02:36:15,000 --> 02:36:17,000
No, I didn't. No, no. I'm still in California.

2490
02:36:17,000 --> 02:36:18,000
No, he moved here.

2491
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:20,000
I'm in Sonoma County actually.

2492
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:21,000
Oh, you're still there?

2493
02:36:21,000 --> 02:36:25,000
Yeah, I'm still here. You can come by anytime, guys.

2494
02:36:25,000 --> 02:36:30,000
I might have to. That's awesome. I thought for some reason you went to Ohio for a bit.

2495
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:33,000
Oh, no, no, no, no. He's just from here. He moved here.

2496
02:36:33,000 --> 02:36:36,000
Oh, okay. Got it. See, I'm a little bit behind on the times too.

2497
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:37,000
No, it's all good.

2498
02:36:37,000 --> 02:36:39,000
All right, but you have a blog. I know you have a blog.

2499
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:40,000
I do.

2500
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:41,000
Do you want to pimp it real quick?

2501
02:36:41,000 --> 02:36:42,000
It has nothing to do with gaming.

2502
02:36:42,000 --> 02:36:46,000
That's all right. Why don't you go ahead and pimp your blog and I'll try to get one more call.

2503
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:50,000
Sure. You guys can check it out at theecomaker.com.

2504
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:57,000
I can type it in the chat room so that you guys can put it on the site or the notes or whatever you want to do.

2505
02:36:57,000 --> 02:37:00,000
And what will people find at theecomaker.com?

2506
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:09,000
Pretty much anything to do with making your own cleaning products to making dinner for dinner ideas and such too.

2507
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:11,000
It's a very homely site.

2508
02:37:11,000 --> 02:37:13,000
Yes, yes, it is.

2509
02:37:13,000 --> 02:37:14,000
All right. Welcome back.

2510
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:16,000
But it also saves you money as well, so it kind of works out.

2511
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:20,000
Welcome back and I'm really glad you decided to stop by tonight. It's always nice to see Blast From the Past.

2512
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:25,000
Yeah, no problem. And hopefully I can check out our show at some point. I don't know. We'll have to talk about that.

2513
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:30,000
Awesome. All right, well you take care and all the best to the hubby as well and you guys take care.

2514
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:31,000
Definitely. You guys take care too.

2515
02:37:31,000 --> 02:37:33,000
All right. Bye.

2516
02:37:33,000 --> 02:37:34,000
Bye.

2517
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:36,000
That was nice to hear from Blast From the Past.

2518
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:37,000
Yep.

2519
02:37:37,000 --> 02:37:39,000
We've been doing this show a long fucking time, you know that?

2520
02:37:39,000 --> 02:37:41,000
Yeah, a long time.

2521
02:37:41,000 --> 02:37:43,000
But hey, we're going to make it to ten.

2522
02:37:43,000 --> 02:37:48,000
You know what? What the hell? One more call. Why not? We had a short news segment tonight.

2523
02:37:48,000 --> 02:37:51,000
We'll open up one more time. Just because our phones were getting slammed there a minute ago.

2524
02:37:51,000 --> 02:37:57,000
So we'll open it up one more time for you guys. 1877 Game OLR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2525
02:37:57,000 --> 02:37:59,000
The phone lines are open.

2526
02:37:59,000 --> 02:38:06,000
But of course this means while I wait for the little delay there, I have to think of another banter topic with Dark Sakura.

2527
02:38:06,000 --> 02:38:10,000
I'm nearly... I'm excited, Rob.

2528
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:12,000
How so? With your project?

2529
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:15,000
Yeah. Thank you for making this possible.

2530
02:38:15,000 --> 02:38:17,000
You're welcome.

2531
02:38:17,000 --> 02:38:19,000
Well, I was just collecting dust at your place anyway.

2532
02:38:19,000 --> 02:38:21,000
Yeah, it's true. No, the old laptop.

2533
02:38:21,000 --> 02:38:24,000
You know, it's amazing the stuff I'm finding while I'm going through and unpacking this.

2534
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:26,000
I found an old picture of you.

2535
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:27,000
Of me.

2536
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:33,000
And Melody taping an episode of Under Sedation Live in Travis's old backyard.

2537
02:38:33,000 --> 02:38:37,000
Oh.

2538
02:38:37,000 --> 02:38:39,000
An old, old picture.

2539
02:38:39,000 --> 02:38:43,000
Melody all huddled together looking cute during... I remember this too. Travis did.

2540
02:38:43,000 --> 02:38:44,000
Yeah.

2541
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:47,000
He did like a backyard episode of Under Sedation Live. I don't remember what the shtick was.

2542
02:38:47,000 --> 02:38:48,000
You'll have to bring it over.

2543
02:38:48,000 --> 02:38:52,000
There's always some shtick with Travis. I love him, but there's always some shtick.

2544
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:54,000
And this is the backyard episode shtick.

2545
02:38:54,000 --> 02:38:55,000
Yeah.

2546
02:38:55,000 --> 02:38:58,000
Oh yeah, I found that. I found one of all of us on a DDR machine.

2547
02:38:58,000 --> 02:39:04,000
It was me, you, Irene. The guy Irene was dating at the time.

2548
02:39:04,000 --> 02:39:06,000
So she probably don't want to see that picture.

2549
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:09,000
You and I... Who else was in it? I think one other person was all in the picture.

2550
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:12,000
Maybe Brad?

2551
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:13,000
Oh, Bradley? No.

2552
02:39:13,000 --> 02:39:15,000
Not Bradley. Brad.

2553
02:39:15,000 --> 02:39:18,000
Yeah, I think he's in it. Hence the crazy person that Irene was dating at the time.

2554
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:19,000
Yeah.

2555
02:39:19,000 --> 02:39:23,000
I don't know. I don't know. I don't remember what else. Somebody else I think was in that picture.

2556
02:39:23,000 --> 02:39:27,000
He was our Mighty Mormon Power Ranger.

2557
02:39:27,000 --> 02:39:30,000
Let's see. What else did I find when I was moving?

2558
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:33,000
Let me know if you find the install disks.

2559
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:34,000
For what? The laptop?

2560
02:39:34,000 --> 02:39:35,000
Yeah.

2561
02:39:35,000 --> 02:39:38,000
I doubt I'll find that.

2562
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:39,000
You know I'm being silly.

2563
02:39:39,000 --> 02:39:41,000
I know.

2564
02:39:41,000 --> 02:39:43,000
I want to see the old pictures.

2565
02:39:43,000 --> 02:39:45,000
I will find those pictures and I will get them to you.

2566
02:39:45,000 --> 02:39:48,000
All right, finally the calls are coming in. The delay caught up.

2567
02:39:48,000 --> 02:39:50,000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

2568
02:39:50,000 --> 02:39:56,000
I made it in. Wow, you guys are like trying to call Britney Spears on a Friday night or something.

2569
02:39:56,000 --> 02:39:58,000
It's great. It feels special.

2570
02:39:58,000 --> 02:40:03,000
This is Derek H. Derek from Virginia Beach, Virginia.

2571
02:40:03,000 --> 02:40:07,000
Derek, how are you? Of course I recognize your voice the minute I picked up. How are you, my friend?

2572
02:40:07,000 --> 02:40:10,000
Eh, you know, it's this and that.

2573
02:40:10,000 --> 02:40:17,000
The important thing is the Commodore 64, I had one. I loved it.

2574
02:40:17,000 --> 02:40:20,000
I started with a VIC-20, went all the way up to an Amiga 1200.

2575
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:26,000
0306060 for those in the know. I'm sorry, 0304040.

2576
02:40:26,000 --> 02:40:30,000
You stuck with Commodore for a very long time because the Amigas were like the last big hurrahs for them.

2577
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:37,000
Yeah, that was sad because if you had an Amiga, you were the type of person that believed.

2578
02:40:37,000 --> 02:40:46,000
And I mean like you believed that one day everybody else would wake up and everybody would be using Amigas.

2579
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:52,000
And you will be vindicated for all your years of, yeah, that never happened.

2580
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:57,000
Amigas were kind of the max of their time, which is ironic because max were out at the same time.

2581
02:40:57,000 --> 02:41:01,000
But you know how people pay the premiums for the Apple products these days?

2582
02:41:01,000 --> 02:41:04,000
Amiga was kind of like that back in the day, in a way.

2583
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:10,000
You know what has happened to Mac? That's what Amiga people thought were going to happen for Amiga.

2584
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:13,000
It had it all.

2585
02:41:13,000 --> 02:41:19,000
If only they had cellular phones when Commodore was big. Maybe they could have been the ones to think of it first.

2586
02:41:19,000 --> 02:41:23,000
That Amiga was so great. But the Commodore 64, I guess, is what we're talking about.

2587
02:41:23,000 --> 02:41:30,000
The Amiga was kick-ass. You said you were thinking about going to get one. Yeah, don't do that.

2588
02:41:30,000 --> 02:41:33,000
Why? Are they all in terrible shape?

2589
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:41,000
Stick with the emulation because once you get one, it's like all of a sudden everything rushes back to you.

2590
02:41:41,000 --> 02:41:50,000
Except it rushes back to you in present day because computers now are literally two to three thousand times faster than the Commodore 64.

2591
02:41:50,000 --> 02:41:55,000
That's not even an exaggeration. Like, a thousand times faster than that thing.

2592
02:41:55,000 --> 02:42:00,000
Yeah, the 64 was for what? 64K of memory that was in that thing?

2593
02:42:00,000 --> 02:42:05,000
64K. I have more memory on one web page.

2594
02:42:05,000 --> 02:42:07,000
Exactly. Yep.

2595
02:42:07,000 --> 02:42:09,000
Good Lord.

2596
02:42:09,000 --> 02:42:21,000
Games, you think they're going to play right, but they don't because back then you expected the lag.

2597
02:42:21,000 --> 02:42:26,000
When you move the joystick, you expected a half second or second thing before something moved on the screen.

2598
02:42:26,000 --> 02:42:31,000
Nowadays, if that happens, you're like, what the hell is wrong with this thing? What's wrong?

2599
02:42:31,000 --> 02:42:38,000
And then you'll fall out of love with the Commodore. Remember the Commodore 64 as it is. As it was, not as it is.

2600
02:42:38,000 --> 02:42:43,000
This happens a lot in gaming. You know, things are better through those retro colored glasses.

2601
02:42:43,000 --> 02:42:49,000
Or, you know, they say the rose colored glasses, but the retro colored glasses, sometimes I think we remember gaming better that way.

2602
02:42:49,000 --> 02:42:53,000
And I just mentioned this earlier in the show, the X-Men arcade game that's on Xbox Live.

2603
02:42:53,000 --> 02:43:00,000
I love the X-Men arcade game, but then when I downloaded it on Xbox Live, I was like, what is this crap that I used to love? You know?

2604
02:43:00,000 --> 02:43:03,000
What the hell is going on here?

2605
02:43:03,000 --> 02:43:08,000
And my favorite game of all time, you guys are talking about favorite games too.

2606
02:43:08,000 --> 02:43:16,000
My favorite game of all time is not just my favorite game of all time, it is the greatest game of all time. Period. End of story.

2607
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:18,000
And that is Elite.

2608
02:43:18,000 --> 02:43:19,000
Elite?

2609
02:43:19,000 --> 02:43:33,000
Elite is insanely good. And for what they stuck on that 64K and that floppy disk, which I think held like 150K or something, some stupid low number.

2610
02:43:33,000 --> 02:43:44,000
It had more worlds on Elite than Mass Effect 1, Mass Effect 2, all of the Wing Commanders combined.

2611
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:51,000
You got Jamie's husband, Dan, up from the couch to come in here to say and agree with you that Elite was awesome, just so you know.

2612
02:43:51,000 --> 02:43:58,000
All the stuff that people say you can do is like, oh, it's an open world. If you want to do this, if you want to be a rogue, be a rogue.

2613
02:43:58,000 --> 02:44:09,000
Elite had that, except it was 25 years ago on a Commodore 64. You can literally say, I'm just gonna spend the rest of my life just moving corn back and forth between these two planets.

2614
02:44:09,000 --> 02:44:14,000
Or I'm just gonna be a policeman and hang out and just kill bad guys while they're trying to run.

2615
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:24,000
Or you can beat anything in that game thousands of years before Grand Theft Auto 4 came around.

2616
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:30,000
Or Star Wars Galaxies Old School of the Jedis thing.

2617
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:37,000
You know, I think the Mass Effect comparison is a pretty good one with Elite. It was like a space game, right?

2618
02:44:37,000 --> 02:44:44,000
Yeah, you could pick your own ship, you could outfit your ship, they had tribbles in it.

2619
02:44:44,000 --> 02:44:50,000
I don't want to play the game, but I can't play it because it's on the freaking Commodore 64 and it's gonna suck if I play it now.

2620
02:44:50,000 --> 02:44:54,000
You have to remember it how it was, Derek. You have to remember it how it was.

2621
02:44:54,000 --> 02:45:00,000
The original SimCity was on the Commodore 64, and of course that game's blown up a million times over.

2622
02:45:00,000 --> 02:45:05,000
What was another great Commodore 64 game? I remember Spy vs. Spy was one of my favorites.

2623
02:45:05,000 --> 02:45:07,000
Little Computer People is The Sims.

2624
02:45:07,000 --> 02:45:13,000
Oh yes, Little Computer People. Oh god, Mule, M-U-L-E, was a huge game.

2625
02:45:13,000 --> 02:45:17,000
That's just a lot of economics in games kind of gets its cue from Mule.

2626
02:45:17,000 --> 02:45:19,000
Good times, Derek, good times.

2627
02:45:19,000 --> 02:45:23,000
Hey, I have to ask you this because, you know, if we both kind of grew up on Commodore,

2628
02:45:23,000 --> 02:45:26,000
did you ever used to type in the programs that were in the back of magazines?

2629
02:45:26,000 --> 02:45:33,000
Of course. Video games and computer entertainment had a little thing I would sit there and type it in.

2630
02:45:33,000 --> 02:45:43,000
And here's the sad part. I did not get a break of 1541 for like a year because we were poor.

2631
02:45:43,000 --> 02:45:50,000
And I still thank my mom because now I don't know how she got me that Commodore 64 because we were poor and she got me one.

2632
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:53,000
So I thank her every day for getting me started on this.

2633
02:45:53,000 --> 02:45:56,000
But it took her a while before I got to 1541.

2634
02:45:56,000 --> 02:46:02,000
So I would sit there and type those programs in and tell everybody not to come near my computer

2635
02:46:02,000 --> 02:46:09,000
and I'll put a pillow over top of it and hide it so nobody would turn it off because once you turn it off, it's gone.

2636
02:46:09,000 --> 02:46:12,000
There's no flash ram saving stuff.

2637
02:46:12,000 --> 02:46:15,000
You didn't have a drive to save on?

2638
02:46:15,000 --> 02:46:20,000
Save. And plus when I first got it, I typed load and load didn't work.

2639
02:46:20,000 --> 02:46:22,000
You had to type load comma eight comma one.

2640
02:46:22,000 --> 02:46:23,000
Yeah.

2641
02:46:23,000 --> 02:46:26,000
It took me a while to figure it out. I was like, this thing is broke, mom.

2642
02:46:26,000 --> 02:46:28,000
It don't work.

2643
02:46:28,000 --> 02:46:33,000
And I knew she wasn't, but I knew if she took it back, she wasn't replacing it.

2644
02:46:33,000 --> 02:46:35,000
She was taking it back and getting her money and I would never see that again.

2645
02:46:35,000 --> 02:46:39,000
So I would just, I would cry without getting it working.

2646
02:46:39,000 --> 02:46:43,000
But you know what? You stuck with it and maybe it taught you a lesson.

2647
02:46:43,000 --> 02:46:44,000
Yeah.

2648
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:50,000
It taught me not to believe in miracles.

2649
02:46:50,000 --> 02:46:52,000
Speaking of believing in miracles, I have to ask this.

2650
02:46:52,000 --> 02:46:57,000
Obviously, a lot of people on the All Games Network know you from your show, Dead Pixel Live.

2651
02:46:57,000 --> 02:47:00,000
I know you're on a little bit of a siesta right now,

2652
02:47:00,000 --> 02:47:05,000
enjoying your Mai Tais on the beach while you're taking a break from Dead Pixel Live.

2653
02:47:05,000 --> 02:47:11,000
But any chance of a revival in the future?

2654
02:47:11,000 --> 02:47:15,000
All I can say now is Dead Pixel Live is currently on hiatus.

2655
02:47:15,000 --> 02:47:20,000
I have found out, as you guys may or may not know, I'm sure you do know,

2656
02:47:20,000 --> 02:47:23,000
this thing kind of fills a hole in your life.

2657
02:47:23,000 --> 02:47:24,000
Yeah.

2658
02:47:24,000 --> 02:47:29,000
And without it, all of a sudden you realize, like, I miss a lot of,

2659
02:47:29,000 --> 02:47:33,000
I kind of want to do my show again, but I guess that maybe I should get out more.

2660
02:47:33,000 --> 02:47:35,000
But I really want to do my show.

2661
02:47:35,000 --> 02:47:39,000
It's like, it's good that it was there, but the fact, I don't know,

2662
02:47:39,000 --> 02:47:42,000
it's all psychological stuff done working.

2663
02:47:42,000 --> 02:47:46,000
I really don't know what I'd do with my Sunday nights without OLR.

2664
02:47:46,000 --> 02:47:48,000
I'd probably be watching Desperate Housewives and that's just sad.

2665
02:47:48,000 --> 02:47:52,000
I know what I would do. I would play more Dragon Age 2.

2666
02:47:52,000 --> 02:47:54,000
Not now, but all right.

2667
02:47:54,000 --> 02:47:57,000
Then you'd be like, I want to tell somebody about Dragon Age 2.

2668
02:47:57,000 --> 02:48:00,000
I remember when I had a show and it was a lot of fun.

2669
02:48:00,000 --> 02:48:03,000
Actually, I'd probably just do another show.

2670
02:48:03,000 --> 02:48:08,000
Oh, listen to how she is. I would just do a show without you guys.

2671
02:48:08,000 --> 02:48:12,000
No, I couldn't do it without you guys.

2672
02:48:12,000 --> 02:48:14,000
Maybe with Tiara.

2673
02:48:14,000 --> 02:48:17,000
All right. Well, Derek, best of luck in whatever it is you do.

2674
02:48:17,000 --> 02:48:20,000
And thanks so much for the call and taking a trip down memory lane with us.

2675
02:48:20,000 --> 02:48:22,000
Hey, thanks. Hey, Amiga forever.

2676
02:48:22,000 --> 02:48:25,000
That's right. Take care, buddy.

2677
02:48:25,000 --> 02:48:27,000
All right. That's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

2678
02:48:27,000 --> 02:48:31,000
Those are some good calls. See, it was worth waiting for.

2679
02:48:31,000 --> 02:48:33,000
Even though, and some folks still didn't get through.

2680
02:48:33,000 --> 02:48:35,000
I'm so sorry. We had more people beeping us.

2681
02:48:35,000 --> 02:48:37,000
The phones were lighting up. Send us an email.

2682
02:48:37,000 --> 02:48:40,000
We had two emails and a lit up phone line.

2683
02:48:40,000 --> 02:48:41,000
What's wrong with this picture?

2684
02:48:41,000 --> 02:48:43,000
Not one, but two.

2685
02:48:43,000 --> 02:48:46,000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com. Send us your thoughts in email.

2686
02:48:46,000 --> 02:48:48,000
That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio,

2687
02:48:48,000 --> 02:48:51,000
but not until we go around and get everybody's final thought.

2688
02:48:51,000 --> 02:48:55,000
Loki, we'll start with you tonight. Your final thought?

2689
02:48:55,000 --> 02:48:59,000
Designing a free-running course is hard.

2690
02:48:59,000 --> 02:49:03,000
My final thought is I still have kitchenware to pack. Joy.

2691
02:49:03,000 --> 02:49:05,000
Dark Sakura, your final thought?

2692
02:49:05,000 --> 02:49:09,000
I wonder what my hair was like in that picture.

2693
02:49:09,000 --> 02:49:10,000
Was it long?

2694
02:49:10,000 --> 02:49:11,000
I think so.

2695
02:49:11,000 --> 02:49:14,000
It was when I had long, really kind of crabby, bushy hair that was five to six shades of red.

2696
02:49:14,000 --> 02:49:15,000
Yes.

2697
02:49:15,000 --> 02:49:16,000
Yeah.

2698
02:49:16,000 --> 02:49:17,000
Good times.

2699
02:49:17,000 --> 02:49:19,000
But I have much better hair these days.

2700
02:49:19,000 --> 02:49:23,000
If you guys like what you hear here at Orange Lounge Radio, tell some friends about the show.

2701
02:49:23,000 --> 02:49:25,000
Word of mouth is all we got to promote the show.

2702
02:49:25,000 --> 02:49:27,000
Leave us a nice reveal on iTunes. That always works as well.

2703
02:49:27,000 --> 02:49:30,000
Or wherever it is that you choose to check out your podcast.

2704
02:49:30,000 --> 02:49:32,000
We really appreciate you guys sticking with us every week.

2705
02:49:32,000 --> 02:49:35,000
We'll be back to do it all again next week. Sound good?

2706
02:49:35,000 --> 02:49:36,000
Yeah.

2707
02:49:36,000 --> 02:49:40,000
And we will see you next time here at Orange Lounge Radio for episode 410 in two weeks.

2708
02:49:40,000 --> 02:49:42,000
I'm sorry, not next week. We are off next week.

2709
02:49:42,000 --> 02:49:44,000
So, we'll be back in two weeks.

2710
02:49:44,000 --> 02:49:48,000
But remember, Jamie wants Portal 2 for PS3.

2711
02:49:48,000 --> 02:49:51,000
And when we come back in two weeks, Portal will be out.

2712
02:49:51,000 --> 02:49:53,000
Mortal Kombat will be out. We'll have tons of stuff to talk about.

2713
02:49:53,000 --> 02:49:55,000
And I'll thank whoever got me Portal 2.

2714
02:49:55,000 --> 02:49:57,000
It's going to be a busy show in a couple weeks.

2715
02:49:57,000 --> 02:49:59,000
So, enjoy the week off, everybody.

2716
02:49:59,000 --> 02:50:02,000
We'll be back in two weeks with another edition of Orange Lounge Radio.

2717
