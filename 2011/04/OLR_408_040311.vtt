Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:08.000
Who's the host?

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
Dark Sakura

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
Sky and the Low Crew

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
Tonight, April 3rd, 2011

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
Two high profile games are outright canceled

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
The 3DS breaks records in its first week

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
And is the Xbox Live Indie Game Store being manipulated?

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
And welcome back to another week of the show

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
Where every gamer has a voice

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
It is episode number 408

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
For this April 3rd, 2011

00:43.000 --> 00:44.000
My name is Rob Roberts

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
I'll be joining you over the next few hours

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
With my co-host, the one and only

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
Fwee

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
How are you?

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
Fwee

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
I'm actually full

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
I'm actually full

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
Full?

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
I made a delicious

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
Full of crap?

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
Uh uh, no that's Shermie

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
I had a delicious meal that I cooked myself

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
Alright

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
By myself

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
Now bake me a pie

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
I don't know how to bake

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
Anything that I've ever baked

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
Except for my failure cake that I told you about last night

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
Has been a disaster

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
And can you tell the listeners what a failure cake is briefly

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
Failure cake

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
Before we get into video game time

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
Was me making chocolate pancakes

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
And then getting bored with the rest of the batter

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
Because I didn't want any more pancakes

01:22.000 --> 01:26.000
So I poured the chocolate batter into a cake pan

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
And then put some giant chocolate chips on it

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
And then baked the whole thing

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
And it tasted delicious

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
I don't know about you guys, I'd still eat that

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
Even though it's a cake of failure

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
It was delicious, delicious fail

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
Alright

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
A host not full of fail

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
Say hello to the one and only tech master, Loki

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
Hello, how's it going?

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
I am good, how are you, Loki?

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
I am doing fine

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
Alright, except we are

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
Why are we not hearing you very well tonight?

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
I don't know

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
Why aren't you hearing me tonight?

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
I think we're hearing you, you're just really quiet

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
I'm really quiet?

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
Yeah, you're good now

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
Sorry

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
I think we have to keep you kind of low

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
Because when the Nintendo topics come up

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
Oh yeah

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
You'll get a little louder!

02:01.000 --> 02:05.000
I'm not louder, I'm more opinionated

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
You're passionate

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
I am passionate, come on

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
It's like, I don't know

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
It's just stupid people doing stupid things

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
Alright, we've got a lot of interesting news stories tonight

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
Kind of along those lines

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
We'll get to those in just a little bit

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
But first let's say hello to a guest here in studio tonight

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
Back again this week

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
Say hello to Salacious Pop

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
What up

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
How you doing Salacious Pop?

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
Good

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
Good, how has life been treating you lately?

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
Um, been really busy

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
Yeah?

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
What's been going on?

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
Preparing for a move

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
Yeah?

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
You moving?

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
Yeah

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
You moving in with Jamie?

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
She's really lonely this week

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
Yeah

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
Alright

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
It's the vault, I'm just going to stay in the vault

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
Awesome

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
I don't even get to play anything, I just get to look at stuff

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
It's awesome

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
Now, we missed April Fools this year

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
Because the show tonight is on the third

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
But you were mentioning a really good April Fools joke

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
You thought we should have done

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
Well I can't talk about it or else I can't do it next year

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
Oh yeah, we got to do it next year I guess

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
Okay, it's really good y'all

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
It was basically like

02:55.000 --> 03:01.000
OLR Episode 3 coming like from the vault of 1982

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
Where with the news stories you're like

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
Yeah, I'm really looking forward to that ET game on the Atari 2600

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
It's going to be great

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
The only thing about that is it's kind of close to what YouTube did

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
So it'll be better next year

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
Yeah

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
Next year y'all forget

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
It's a little too close to Flugelhorn feline

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
Which by the way was the best April Fools joke on the web

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
Just so you know

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
Alright, anyhow

03:19.000 --> 03:22.000
Well, by the way, Rob, it's not a rumor

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
Now, see, oh

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
Okay, before we went live tonight

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
See, now I have to talk about all this because you brought it up

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
Okay, before we went live tonight

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
Bobby was abbreviated tonight

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
So we went live a little bit early

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
Just kind of BSing with the live listeners and doing some music

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
And one of the topics that came up before the show was

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
The Wachowski Brothers and they did The Matrix

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
And there's these rumors or something going around

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
That one of them had a sex change

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
Larry is now Lana

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
But now, see, the chat room, Tiger Closener chat room

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
Which by the way, hi chat room, chat.orangelsauce.com

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
Saying that's not true

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
It's on IMDB

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
Is it?

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
Yeah

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
Credited on IMDB

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
I thought some producer said it wasn't true, IDK

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
Well, I mean, you know

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
Alright, there you go

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
Well, if it's on IMDB, I guess it's true

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
You know what?

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
The Matrix 2 and 3 still sucked

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
Boy or girl directing

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
Yes

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
Alright, let's talk about video games

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
Of course, we do that here on the show

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
Chat.orangelsauceradio.com

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
If you're listening to us live on this Sunday night at All Games Radio

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
We do tape live at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at allgames.com

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
So join us in our chat room

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
To get to the chat room, chat.orangelsauceradio.com

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
Have I plugged all the websites?

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
I believe so

04:32.000 --> 04:36.000
Twitter, OLR, Facebook, Orangelsauce Radio, etc, etc

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
Now we can talk about games

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
Hi Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
Hi

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
I played a lot of Dragon Age 2

04:40.000 --> 04:45.000
I borrowed it from my friend's husband

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
Well, he's my friend too

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
But I borrowed his game

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
And it's really fun

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
And I'm kind of hooked

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
And I played some WoW

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
And some Final Fantasy 3

04:55.000 --> 05:00.000
And then I looked at games at Fry's with U2

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
Yes

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
That was it

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
We went shopping last night and not for shoes

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
I didn't buy anything

05:05.000 --> 05:09.000
I know, it's kind of sad to go to a huge electronics store like Fry's

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
Which, I don't think they have those everywhere

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
I think just on the west coast

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
So Fry's is just like, it's an uber electronics store

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
I think they're spread around

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
Yeah, there might be a few in other places

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
But yeah, it's an uber electronics store

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
Huge games section, huge computer section

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
We went in there, looked around

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
Didn't buy anything

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
It's kind of sad

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
Their PSP section amazed me

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
They do have a lot

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
That still exists

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
Well, there's still a lot of good stuff coming on the PSP

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
The UMD's

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
Yeah, the UMD's were what impressed me too

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
That they're still really supporting them

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
$10 for most of them

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
Because they got them really cheap, I'm sure

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
I guess so, I don't know

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
You know, there's only one company still supporting UMD

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
And that's Sony

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
Of course

05:49.000 --> 05:52.000
I don't remember the last movie

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
I want to say 2012 was one of the last movies to come out for it

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
Zira, they are kick-ass

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
Whatever came out last

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
No, I know I was looking and I was like

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
Oh, Charlie's Angels Full Throttle is only $4

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
And they have like 40 copies of it sitting on the shelf

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
That's kind of the sad thing is that sometimes Fry's just way over stocks

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
A certain game or something

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
I'll tell you what else they had just hundreds

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
I'm not even lying

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
Hundreds of copies of just trying to get rid of them

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
Castlevania Lords of Shadow

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
Because it sucks

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
The new God of War-y Castlevania

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
Because they're fucking cutthroat with their goddamn vendors

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
Every time the vendors come out and stuff

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
And we get to talking about different customers

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
They're talking about visiting Fry's

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
They fucking hate visiting Fry's

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
Because Fry's, they're just cutthroat

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
They want everything

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
And it's just, it's ridiculous

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
They're like, I hate fucking going and visiting Fry's

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
SolarFlare's in our chatroom at chat.org.com saying

06:43.000 --> 06:46.000
I've lived on the west coast for over 20 years and have never seen a Fry's

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
Maybe they don't have them in Oregon

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
I don't think they do, Oregon or Washington

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
I'm not sure where SolarFlare's is

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
But I think they're mostly like

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
I know there's a few in the bay, some in SoCal

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
There are some in Texas, I know that

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
I think they dip into Arizona and the southwest a little bit

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
So I think they go south and west, not north and west, sadly

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
So, alright, anyhow

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
Uh, Loki

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
Wait, wait, I want to go back to Dark Soccer and talk more about Dragon Age 2

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
Because I haven't played the game

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
So you're enjoying Dragon Age 2?

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
Yes, it has Eve Miles doing a voice

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
For anyone who does not know, she was Gwen on Torchwood

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
Now you didn't really play the first game, right?

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
No

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
And you're doing okay with the second game?

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
Yeah, just fine

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
What is it that you like so much about it?

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
Lesbians

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
Have you...

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
Did you draw that?

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
Not really

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
Have you actually gotten to the part where they, you know

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
Well, right now Meryl the elf

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
Is gushing over my character

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
Which is kind of cute and funny

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
Because my character is all like face tats

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
And red eyeshadows, she's really fierce looking

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
And she's a rogue

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
And, uh

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
But they've already had, like, love chat

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
And then there's this one guy who was hitting on my character

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
I was like, no you're gross

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
But he was apparently from an earlier game

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
He's the one that you give him a cat called Sir Pouncealot

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
I guess

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
He was talking about his cat

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
And then there's Isabella

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
Who's, according to Tiara

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
She's a slut

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
She can sleep with her a bunch

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
And then she's like, oh, it's just sex

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
So, I'm like, I haven't gotten to any fun part though

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
I mean, I've done a lot of

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
I really like this game, but it's not fun

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
No

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
It's kind of what I just heard, it's just me

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
I've done a lot of killing

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
Which is great

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
And I've got it in extra gore mode

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
So, like, they're covered in blood

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
When you're done with a fight

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
And they're battered on their face

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
And then I was like, that's awesome

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
Okay, gore and lesbians, got it

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
This game really isn't fun

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
I'm just here for the pussy

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
And gore

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
It actually is really fun

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
I'm still in the first act

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
Okay, you're like in the grind or something, right?

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
Yeah

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
Trying to grind out that pussy

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
Well, some elven cooch

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
Say no more

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
What's the battle system like?

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
It's like you run down

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
The stairs, oh no, there's people there

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
And one of your party comments

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
About how there shouldn't be people on the street after dark

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
And then you have to kill them

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
And there's blood everywhere

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
And you occasionally

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
No, they're like highwaymen

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
And you can go outside of the town

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
To certain areas

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
And you'll find piles of bones

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
And you can dig through them for loot

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
I see

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
It's really great though

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
And, okay, I guess

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
So now you're talking about touching bones

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
In your quest for pussy

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
My quest for pussy

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
No, it's

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
There's also, you know, you can go through people's stuff

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
And right now I'm actually trying to build up my character

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
So I can get the lock picking

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
So I can open locked

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
Trunks and stuff and steal people's stuff

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
And

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
What else was I doing?

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
There's just, I'm doing

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
A lot of the side quests too

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
So I can level up before I get to the

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
The big thing

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
But there's somewhere else that I need

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
To go to get some dude named Fenris

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
Who was, I think, in one of the last games

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
Now it's gonna be a three way

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
Well, no, I don't

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
Okay, Meryl

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
Is my fangirlism because

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
I adore Eve Miles

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
She's very cool

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
And Welsh accents to me are hot

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
Really hot

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
Alright

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
And I don't

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
The elves that live outside

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
Are all Welsh

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
The elves and humans that live in the town

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
Are all British

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
And dwarves are American

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
Is what I'm getting so far

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
Whereas, you know, don't we usually

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
Have dwarves being Scottish?

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
Well, if you play WoW a lot, yeah, dwarves are Scottish

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
Or, you know, Lord of the Rings

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
Well, no, he sounded vaguely

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
He didn't, he sounded Welsh

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
Alright, well, you think you'll play Dragon Age 2

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
Through to completion?

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
Yeah. Alright, that's good

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
It's always good to finish. I'll take pictures

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
Of the lesbian scene. Alright, please do

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
Alright, let's move on over to Loki

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
Loki, how was your gaming week? Um, it was okay

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
I played Motorstorm Apocalypse

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
Through rookie mode now

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
And I think most of the way through

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
Pro mode

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
Although, it's like, all the races have been

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
Somewhat difficult up until now

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
And it's just like

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
And now it's really, really hard

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
So, I'm actually stuck on one

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
Race right now

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
But, really enjoying it still

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
Storyline's still really cheesy

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
But, still

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
Pretty fun game

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
And then, I've been playing

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
On my 3DS

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
Really only pilot wings right now

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
And I haven't really played any of the

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
Like, I don't know

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
The missions or whatever you have to do

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
Different challenges

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
Mainly the free-flying

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
Which is kind of annoying a little bit

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
Because you can only fly around for like

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
A few minutes at a time

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
Which is so

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
Stupid

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
It's like 3 minutes at a time

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
Fun!

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
Well, I mean, you do only have a limited amount of fuel, right?

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
Well, okay

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
If you want to go by that route

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
Then why can't I have it

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
Where I refuel, or

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
Gas is expensive, you know

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
Or, like, when I'm using the rocket belt

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
I never get low on fuel

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
I could hold that fuel

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
You know, the throttle down the whole way

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
And it just never would run out of fuel

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
But, um

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
I'm basically collecting these markers

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
Or whatever they're in the game

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
And I have 74 of 75 of them

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
So, I'm still trying to find the last one

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
But, it's just like

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
You know, the Wuhu Island thing

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
It's like

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
Oh, hey, look at this

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
This is from Wii Sports Resort

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
Oh, this is the part where you can, uh

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
Here's the bowling alley, here's all this stuff from the game

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
I'm like, okay, well none of this has to do with

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
Flying

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
Can you, like, crash through the roof of the bowling alley?

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
No, you can't

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
How boring!

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
You can fly through tunnels and stuff

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
You know, it's kind of cool jogging around

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
I guess in Wii Sports Resort or something

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
Well, actually, no it wouldn't be

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
Because you'd be jogging in place and that's really boring

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
But, um, I could see

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
If you're into jogging in place, what the appeal

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
Might be, um

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
But, it's just

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
It seems really lazy to me

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
I mean, they could have just easily created

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
A new island, it's not that damn

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
Detailed at all, I mean

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
Somebody could easily create an island within

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
A day

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
I mean, there's no animations

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
Whatsoever going around, there's no

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
Cars moving around, no people running around

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
It's just all

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
Not doing anything

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
It seems to be like a dark pilot wings

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
Where you can, like, rocket belt into the bowling alley

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
And steal a baby and, like, run away with it

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
Or, you know

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
Yeah, see, once again

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
And this is unfortunate

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
This goes back to Nintendo

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
What they do with new games

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
Or, I should say, games that they put out again

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
They basically take them

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
They don't add any features to it

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
And they strip it down to what the bare essentials

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
That they need to do another release for

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
It's just like all the Animal Crossing games

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
And here's the problem

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
People like us keep buying them

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
And so it teaches them

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
Actually, you're the only one that's bought a 3DS in this room

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
No, I'm talking about Animal Crossing

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
Oh, okay

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
No, I'm just saying, uh, it's people like us

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
That keep buying those crappy games

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
And it just gives them the impression

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
Okay, so we don't really do anything

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
People just still buy our games

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
It's just like the whole Tron thing

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
What's different this year?

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
We put a 12 on the box

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
I mean, it's okay

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
It's somewhat fun

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
I haven't played through everything yet

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
But, you know, you're looking at

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
What was on the original Super Nintendo

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
Version, it's just

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
I'm sorry, it's even less content than that

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
I mean, you really couldn't

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
You know, bother to

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
Put the extra content in there

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
They don't even remove the landing pads

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
And stuff like that, they're in the different missions and stuff

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
They're in the free mode, they're just all sitting there

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
Still, because they didn't bother to

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
Even say, okay, well, during this mode

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
This isn't here, or whatever

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
It's just, it's always there

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
Let me get you some questions from our chat room

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
At chat.orangesonshooter.com

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
Robert M. is asking, Loki, Loki, can you shoot in pilot wings?

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
No balloon popping, at least?

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
There's a few levels in the mission mode

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
Where you can do that

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
Shooting or balloon popping? Or both?

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
Both

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
Let's see, TigerClaw is asking, what they should have done

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
Is recreated that helicopter mission from the first pilot wings

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
Most people never even saw those missions

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
The first pilot wings was hard

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
Well, they've got some stuff that's

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
Undocumented

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
Or whatever, it's not on the box

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
Where they have the squirrel suit

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
Or whatever, you could do skydiving in there

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
Wait, the squirrel suit?

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
Yeah, like a flying squirrel suit

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
It's not really a squirrel suit

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
It's like, have you seen those

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
Skydiving things that they've got the webbing

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
Between your arm and your body

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
And the leg and your body

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
So it provides more drag so you can fly around

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
When we're talking about a flying squirrel

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
I'm thinking of Rocky from the Rocky and Bowling Cool show

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
No, it's not like some stupid Mario

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
Thing where you're in a tanooki suit

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
Or some crap like that

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
I'm literally imagining a

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
Skydiving squirrel

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
That trick never works

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
I'd pay to play that

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
But it's just

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
I don't know

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
It's a fun game

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
I guess, it's what I've been playing

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
Just because I just wanted to play

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
Through some of that

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
I've played Ridge Racer a ton

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
Street Fighter, it's alright

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
I saw a question about the battery life

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
Earlier in chat

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
And that's a bitch I've heard

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
The battery life isn't really that great

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
On these things

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
I haven't really had a problem with it

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
Because I keep charging it all the time

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
I've never had it run out on me

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
But then again, I also

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
Don't leave it in sleep mode

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
Because I figured that the battery would go dead

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
And I kind of want to play the game

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
That's the thing, they have all these things that rely on sleep mode

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
And I know that doesn't suck

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
As much battery as playing a game would

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
But, you know, if it's

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
Running out of battery that fast

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
Why rely on sleep mode for all this stuff?

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
Let me go to another

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
Question from chat, and I think this is a good one

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
Savalas in our chat room is asking

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
At chat.org.com

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
Loki, do you have buyer's remorse with buying the

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
Nintendo 3DS now that we're a week in?

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
No, not really

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
I mean, I got the few games that I wanted to get

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
And that's it, and that's what I'm gonna plan on

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
Getting until

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
You know, whenever the next best game comes out

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
I mean, there's the

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
Dream Trigger game that I'm thinking about getting

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
Whenever the hell that comes out, and

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
That's pretty much it, I mean

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
Everything else is gonna be fourth quarter, so

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
I'm perfectly fine with what I have right now

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
That's why I didn't purposely go

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
And just buy all the stuff that came out launched

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
Because a lot of it's crap

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
And a lot of it, you know, even the reviewers go

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
This is basically the game that

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
Came up before, but now it's in 3D

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
And it doesn't really utilize 3D that much

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
And you're gonna get a lot of that stuff

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
Because people don't know how to utilize it

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
Or they're gonna try to cash in real quick

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
Especially putting out a budget game

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
Because all the games are $40

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
So a $20 game stands out because, hey, that's much cheaper

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
But

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
You get what you pay for? Exactly, yeah

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
Alright

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
And then what else did I play? Oh, Game Dev Story

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
But still playing a little bit of that

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
That's kind of mindless because

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
My team is so good at developing

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
Stuff that

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
I mean, we beat out everybody in the awards

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
And all that stuff, it's kind of fun

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
Even the fictional company

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
That's the game publisher

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
Of the actual game

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
Their

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
Toilet system is not

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
Doing well compared to

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
Compared to my glory hole system

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
Yes, that's what it's called, the glory hole

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
Kay

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
Everybody loves the glory hole

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
Alright

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
And then Cry Theft Auto

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
That's what I played this week

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
Alright, let me go over to SalaciousPop

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
How was your gaming week? It was alright

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
Pretty slow

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
Played some Pac-Man Championship Edition DX

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
Some Super Street Fighter IV

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
A lot of the

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
Mortal Kombat

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
PS3 demo

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
And I finally got to play Marvel vs. Capcom 3

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
What did you think of MVC 3?

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
I really liked what I saw of it

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
Definitely want to get it at some point

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
It has the sort of hybrid

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
Four button controls that

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
The Dreamcast used for

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
Marvel vs. Capcom 2

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
And then I guess also Tatsunoko vs. Capcom

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
For the Wii uses something similar

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
And I didn't realize that it played like that

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
So when I was using a six button

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
Fight pad

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
I wasn't quite landing the combos

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
That I thought I was because I realized

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
Oh, well not all the buttons are mapped the way I thought they were

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
There's no low, medium, strong

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
Punch, low, medium, strong kick

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
They're kind of combined

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
Some of them

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
So yeah, I loved it

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
Was there a particular character you really enjoyed?

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
I don't

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
Really care for her

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
In the context that she appears

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
In the Marvel universe

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
The female Wolverine

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
Clone, X-23 I think her name is

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
She was fun to use

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
Cool

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
Anything else you want to share about your game a week?

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
Um

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
The fatalities in the

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
Mortal Kombat demo

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
Are really gory but they're all kind of stupid

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
And they're all kind of the same

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
You think? Yeah

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
See, here's my whole thing

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
You know I hate the Saw movies and all that stuff

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
And I talk about this on the show

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
But yet I giggle so much at Mortal Kombat

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
And all the fatalities

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
And some of them are really bad

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
Like the Melina one, what does Melina do?

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
She walks up to you like she's going to kiss you

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
And then she

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
Sucks you up and spits you out

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
No it's not like you think that's what's going to happen

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
But she like rips off your face

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
She throws her thighs at you

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
So they're out of your rib cage

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
So you're all spiked

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
And then she makes like this

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
I guess Melina's always horny or whatever

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
She's always moaning and cooing

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
So it looks like she's going to kiss you

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
And then she rips your head off at the jawline

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
So that your chin and jaw

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
Is still attached and your body falls over

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
Then she eats your tongue

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
Out of the head that she has in her hand

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
She doesn't just eat it, she goes

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
Like it's sushi

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
She's got Baraka face

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
And then so she eats your tongue out of your

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
Sort of severed head and then she just chucks it to the ground

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
Like a football, like eh

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
And then she jumps on the camera

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
And like kind of tries to dry hump it

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
Right? Well that's if you're

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
That's her non, like if you don't do a fatality

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
You just let them fall down

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
And then she like smears blood on her boobs

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
Because again she's always horny

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
Like I don't know what her problem is

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
I bet yet the whole time I see this

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
For the first time I'm giggling maniacally

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
And like Alan's like what's wrong with you

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
And as soon as, I know I don't really appreciate

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
The whole TNA fighter game thing at all

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
Because as soon as I saw her buck naked outfit

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
I'm like she's going to get a yeast infection

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
In that onesie

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
She has a naked outfit?

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
She's not really naked

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
She's wearing floss

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
She's wearing floss

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
And the best part

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
Is that this new Mortal Kombat

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
Game, the blood kind of seems to stay

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
On the characters and it stays like

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
In kind of natural looking ways

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
So after she's fighting or whatever, her boobs will be like

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
Covered in blood and she's like rubbing her boobs

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
It's all like, it's really

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
Disgusting but funny

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
It's just a PS3 demo

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
It's not the game yet

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
Because the demo has four characters in it

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
And the fatality for Scorpion

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
If you look it up in the off menu

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
Is wrong

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
The fatality for Scorpion was just backwards

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
That was funny

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
Actually wait, hold on

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
You know what I should do here

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
Is I should actually just pull this up real quick

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
It is a three hour show, we have time to do some fun things here

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
Describe Scorpion's fatality for us real quick

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
Because that was pretty funny too

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
He takes his katana

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
And he slices your head off

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
And then again at the waist

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
But he does it so fast

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
Obviously it's going through you but you're still upright

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
And then he kicks

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
Your stomach

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
So your middle piece flies back

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
So then your legs fall

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
And your head goes up in the air and then he cuts your head

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
In half like a cantaloupe

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
Well I love the

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
Fruit ninja reference there

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
Okay, here you go Dark Soccer, you ready?

23:18.000 --> 23:26.000
Here you go, enjoy!

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
See she's all sexy walking

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
And then give me a kiss boy

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
Sike

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
See and then she's all like rubbing her boobs

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
She's all mmm I just ate that guy's tongue

23:42.000 --> 23:48.000
That's the best fatality ever

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
There you go

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
See, I gotta admit

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
I gave the demo an unfavorable review a couple weeks ago

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
It is growing on me a little bit

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
It's growing on me just a little bit

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
I think having seen some more of the fatalities

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
And getting to do

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
Like kind of getting more comfortable with the fighting system

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
Because you know they took out the whole weapon thing

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
And all that's gone now

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
So it's a little bit back to old school

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
And you know kind of getting used to that again

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
It's growing on me, I think I will get the full version

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
So I can do more fatalities

24:16.000 --> 24:20.000
And Salacious Pop can be very disappointed with me

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
And I have one other thing to add to my gaming week

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
So when I was

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
After I downloaded the Mortal Kombat demo for PS3

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
I noticed there was a new Castlevania

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
And there have been so many Castlevania releases in the last two years

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
I was just like oh I'll get this whatever it is

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
And it's the one that just came out within the last month

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
What's it, we were just talking about it

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
What's the name, it's Castlevania

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
Lords of Shadow

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
Yeah, I played maybe ten minutes of it

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
And I was like okay well this is just them

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
Trying to be God of War

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
And for some reason

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
I don't want to say that it hurt to look at

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
Like it didn't give me a headache

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
But just running around

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
Something was off about the graphics visually

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
It was hard to look at, I don't know

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
But I was like okay this is God of War, Castlevania

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
And I just deleted it

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
It originally wasn't a Castlevania game

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
Oh yeah that's right it wasn't supposed to be a Castlevania game originally

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
It's a new IP when we can just slap Castlevania on it

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
There you go

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
sj100matt is in our chat room talking about the Mortal Kombat demo

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
And the fatality is saying

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
Rob you should show your mom the game

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
Rob that's gross, Rob

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
Actually that's a great idea for a future

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
OLR YouTube

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
She looks cold, she needs a jacket

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
We will get right on that

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
That sounds like a great future OLR YouTube

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
Is Rob's mom plays Mortal Kombat

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
It'll be fine, good times

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
Alright let's see my gaming week

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
There was some stuff that Salacious Pop did

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
But there was some different things

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
One night randomly we were having You Don't Know Jack

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
Which has kind of become this strange Friday tradition

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
All of a sudden which I'm kind of liking

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
Friday night playing You Don't Know Jack and drinking wine

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
I think you need stronger booze

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
But yeah the booze in You Don't Know Jack is good

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
Wine keeps it classy

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
Yes wine keeps it very classy

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
With the fart jokes in You Don't Know Jack

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
Which is always hilarious

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
But then we just started playing old school games

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
And when I say old school I mean like

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
Old school on the Xbox Live Arcade

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
And some things they don't even sell anymore

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
We were playing Smash TV

26:08.000 --> 26:12.000
We were playing the Mortal Kombat 3 Ultimate

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
The arcade one that's on

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
Or was on Xbox Live that's not there anymore

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
So we were kind of having fun just playing some of those old games

26:18.000 --> 26:22.000
And it's neat because you can kind of see how far along

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
The Xbox Live Arcade really has come

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
I mean it really was just a bunch of ports in the beginning

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
And some of them weren't done very well

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
Looking back, now going back and playing

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
The Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 I'm kind of like

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
Well where's the move list in the game?

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
Or where's you know anything

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
It's just literally the ROM

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
Just dumped and sold on Xbox Live Arcade

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
So they have come a ways

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
A little bit since then

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
And you know I think back to some of the episodes

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
We were doing back then and I seem to remember

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
We were complaining about that a lot

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
That a lot of the releases were just ROMs being dumped

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
On Xbox Live Arcade and I think Microsoft tried to fix that

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
After the first year or two

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
They said okay no more of that

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
That's a feature

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
Well excuse me princess

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
Not entirely the arcade

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
No I get what you're saying though

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
Yeah well remember we were playing Mortal Kombat 3

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
And for some reason

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
I could remember Kabal combos

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
Kabal was the character I used to use in Mortal Kombat all the time

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
And I remember how to make him do the spinny thing

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
And then punch punch uppercut

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
Little laser purple pew pew beam

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
I could do all that still

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
Yet when it came to fatality time I couldn't remember how to do it

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
So I'm like well let me pause and go to the move list

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
Let's just pause and reconfigure the buttons

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
Or quit

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
So we had to go on GameFAQs to get the fatality

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
But then we were like too lazy to do it

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
Let's just play something else

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
Let's play Smash GV

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
I will say one new game I played this week

27:40.000 --> 27:44.000
I played a free game that's now available on the Playstation 3

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
Called Free Realms

27:46.000 --> 27:50.000
Free Realms is a free MMO

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
That is available on the Playstation 3

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
And that's what they're calling it

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
It's a what?

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
A freemium MMO

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
And you download this 25 meg file

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
And first I was like oh shit this thing's small

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
This is a small game

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
Alright so I launch the game

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
Only to wait and download 700 more megabytes

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
So I'm like fine

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
It's Playstation home

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
So I'll go in the other room and play WoW and then come back in an hour

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
So finally I get in there and it's like choose your character

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
And you can do little character customizations

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
You chose this character

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
And I don't need to download that character

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
No that was the last time I downloaded

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
But you can either be a male or female

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
And you can be a human or you can be a fairy

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
So of course I rolled a man fairy

28:30.000 --> 28:34.000
Because I figured nobody was going to be playing those in the game

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
So it would be kind of funny

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
And don't you dare be making jokes

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
Because I'll beat you

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
Alright so anyway

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
I rolled the character

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
You can do a custom name

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
But if you do a custom name then it has to go to be approved

28:48.000 --> 28:52.000
So you have to choose a name from this slot machine thing

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
They have all these pre-approved names

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
A first name like a middle name and a last name

28:56.000 --> 29:02.000
I think my name ended up being like Rob like Forest Tree or something

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
I don't remember something really dumb

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
So I went in there whatever

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
And then it's just okay

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
Now you're in free realms have fun

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
No tutorial no setup

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
No nothing just

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
Okay here you are

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
No tutorial? What is this?

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
A paid game?

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
So I was like okay well I kind of figured it out I think

29:22.000 --> 29:26.000
Like I went around and figured out how to start mining

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
And I was like okay I'm going to mine

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
So the mining game is kind of like

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
I don't know it's like

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
Bejeweled but not really

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
Imagine if the point of Bejeweled was not to swap tiles

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
But instead you drew lines

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
That matched all the colors that were in a row

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
And you had to do like three or more

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
There's a game like that on Gaia

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
That's the mining game

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
It sounds like puzzle quest 2 when you have to pick lock a chest

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
Or bash open a door there's a sort of

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
Jewel game

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
It's different

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
I guess they just put out puzzle pirates on consoles

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
I mean seriously

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
That's an old school game I miss that game

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
That was actually a really rad MMO I want to go back and check that out

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
Anyway this is about free realms you be quiet

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
So I did that and whatever

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
So I was doing the quests

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
And I noticed that in the quests

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
If you did not want to try to find

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
The NPC that's the next step of the quest

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
You could just hit R2

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
And your character would just auto fly there

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
I fly because I'm a fairy

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
You just auto fly there or whatever

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
And okay so I made it really easy

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
So I kind of figured it out

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
This MMO is really for kids

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
It's a kids MMO

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
How many people were wandering around like

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
LOL want to buy gold or whatever

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
Nobody was really talking

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
You could see other real people

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
Yeah I guess

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
Do you have a player or do you have pre-determined things

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
That you have to say because it is

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
I don't know I didn't try to chat

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
I don't want to talk to these people

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
I just want to figure out what the game is

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
So I gathered

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
It is a bunch of minigames

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
Thrown together to make an MMO

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
I don't know if you saw

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
There's something called penguin defense

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
I love penguins it's like a tower defense game

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
And then there's basically every

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
Facebook-y puzzle game

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
99 cent iPhone game is somewhere in here

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
Which is one of the crafting types

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
I don't know if you saw but the guy

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
That you know I guess is

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
The head of

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
The team that made this game or whatever

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
Is like saying well our game is actually

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
Really really similar to

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
Minecraft I'm like

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
What? No it was nothing like Minecraft

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
Really? But apparently like the house building

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
Or some crap in there is

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
Similar to Minecraft but not

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
You can customize your house but it

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
Struck me a little more Animal Crossing than it is in Minecraft

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
It's not Minecraft he's just stupid

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
Well and here's the other thing folks

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
Once I got to like the 4th

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
Level of mining it was like

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
Do you want to play more mining?

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
Become a member today of free realm

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
So that was it

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
So essentially this MMO is just all these

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
Little minigames but you can play all the minigames

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
Up to level 4 and then it's like

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
Oh you gotta be a member

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
So it's sodium 1? Yeah basically

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
So I'm sorry that's not a

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
Free MMO

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
A demo of a pay MMO

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
This is another

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
Instance of a game company using deceptive

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
Terms to market their product

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
Because a lot of people are probably going to check this out because it's a free MMO

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
And I'm here to tell you it is not a free MMO

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
It is a demo

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
Of an MMO and I know what their defense

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
Would be is that well

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
Once you capital you can still

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
Be in the world and you can still talk to

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
People and you can still customize your fairy

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
And to their defense

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
And I hate going to their defense but

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
Their defense is actually

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
A pretty cheap MMO

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
$35 for a lifetime membership

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
But once again

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
Why would you want to do that?

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
Pay 99 cents and get the same games

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
On the iPhone it's really the same deal

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
$35 for a lifetime membership but there's no reason

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
To believe the longevity would be

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
More than 2 years before they shut the servers

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
Down because no one's going to play it

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
Here's the thing

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
I will give it this credit

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
I thought it was kind of dopey

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
Maybe twice and I was like okay I think I've done

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
Everything there is to do in this game

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
I see it more like a kids MMO

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
I think that's where they've obviously

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
Taken a lot of safety precautions

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
A lot of it's kind of watered down

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
I think this is something more for kids

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
But here is where they screwed it royally

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
There's no tutorial

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
There's nothing to kind of help you

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
Understand what you're supposed to do in this game

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
And I think a lot of kids

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
Would get really frustrated with it

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
I think this would really have to be

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
I think there's a very specific age range

33:30.000 --> 33:33.000
It's probably like 10 to 13 year old girls

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
I think would enjoy Free Realms

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
And maybe some boys but I don't know

33:37.000 --> 33:40.000
It just strikes me as more of a girly game

33:40.000 --> 33:41.000
Because there's not a lot of violence

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
And yes I'm being totally sexist right now

33:43.000 --> 33:44.000
But that's really it

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
It's more of a tween game

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
Like I could see the Jonas Brothers

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
And Justin Bieber showing up here

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
That's what Free Realms struck me as

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
So that was it

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
That was Free Realms

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
It's free so I guess if you want to check it out

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
Go for it but I think you'll get bored of it

34:00.000 --> 34:03.000
You just totally made me think of a good porn star name

34:03.000 --> 34:04.000
What's that?

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
Justine Beaver

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
Probably already

34:08.000 --> 34:09.000
There probably is one

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
Because I thought you said Justin Beaver

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
And I knew you said Bieber

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
But then it made me think of how I was calling him Justine

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
And then Justine Beaver

34:17.000 --> 34:20.000
Going to our chatroom at chat.orangelaungeradio.com

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
Robert M in our chat says

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
I assume Free Realms is the same on the PC

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
As far as the Freemium model

34:26.000 --> 34:27.000
I think so

34:27.000 --> 34:28.000
Yes

34:28.000 --> 34:29.000
Okay

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
I wasn't really motivated to go check

34:31.000 --> 34:32.000
You'll have to excuse me

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
I think this is not necessarily

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
Granted it's a way

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
I think it's going to get a lot of exposure to people

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
That might not normally try it

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
Because it's integrated with the PlayStation Network

34:42.000 --> 34:46.000
And it's technically free to start playing it

34:46.000 --> 34:50.000
But it can also be used as kind of data for them

34:50.000 --> 34:53.000
Because they're working on a new EverQuest

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
They're working on some other

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
I forget what else

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
There's another IP that they're working on

34:59.000 --> 35:00.000
A sequel for

35:00.000 --> 35:01.000
That's also an MMO

35:01.000 --> 35:04.000
But it'll work on this to see what works

35:04.000 --> 35:05.000
What doesn't work

35:05.000 --> 35:06.000
And it's a good way

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
Imagine if EverQuest came out the next one

35:08.000 --> 35:12.000
As a free to play type of game

35:12.000 --> 35:13.000
Or something like that

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
That might have a lot of appeal

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
Here's the other kind of interesting thing

35:17.000 --> 35:18.000
I just want to throw out there

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
As long as we're talking about MMOs on consoles

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
Because there really haven't been a lot of successful ones

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
DC Universe to be determined

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
Obviously that one's kind of still new

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
Home

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
Despite all the smack

35:30.000 --> 35:31.000
I'm talking about Free Realms

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
I felt there was more to do in Free Realms

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
Than there was to do in Home

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
I kind of felt like the effort that was spent

35:37.000 --> 35:38.000
Making Free Realms

35:38.000 --> 35:39.000
Would have been better spent

35:39.000 --> 35:40.000
Putting minigames into Home

35:40.000 --> 35:41.000
Or making Home

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
Have more of a game element to it

35:43.000 --> 35:44.000
I get that Home

35:44.000 --> 35:47.000
I guess is supposed to be a little more about multimedia

35:47.000 --> 35:48.000
And I don't know

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
Maybe more about the chatting and so forth

35:50.000 --> 35:51.000
Whatever

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
I kind of felt like

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
There was at least some point to Free Realms

35:55.000 --> 35:58.000
Even if it was one I did not care to delve into further

35:58.000 --> 35:59.000
Than Home

35:59.000 --> 36:00.000
Where you log in and it's kind of like

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
If there's not a new world to go explore for five minutes

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
You're kind of like LOL bored by

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
You know?

36:06.000 --> 36:07.000
So I don't know

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
It strikes me as odd that

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
And I realize it's a different development team

36:11.000 --> 36:12.000
Sony's a huge company

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
And Free Realms already existed in some regard on the PC

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
So I mean

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
It just seems weird to me that Home

36:18.000 --> 36:19.000
After all these years

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
Still I don't see the point of logging in

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
To Home regularly

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
There's nothing for me to really check every day

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
I don't know

36:27.000 --> 36:28.000
Anyhow

36:28.000 --> 36:29.000
That was my gaming week

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
Talked a lot about Free Realms

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
And some of the other minigames

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
Are there plans or something like that in Free Realms?

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
I think they have guilds

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
But I wouldn't know the first thing

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
Can you invite the people to your house?

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
Your guild members to your house?

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
Honestly Loki I didn't play that far

36:45.000 --> 36:46.000
You probably can

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
And that's more people that can come to your house

36:48.000 --> 36:49.000
And fucking Home!

36:49.000 --> 36:50.000
Awesome!

36:50.000 --> 36:51.000
Way to go Sony!

36:51.000 --> 36:52.000
Bravo!

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
I am confident in saying though

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
That if there are TVs in Free Realms

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
You can't put videos or pictures on them

36:58.000 --> 36:59.000
Just like Home

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
I'm pretty confident in saying that

37:01.000 --> 37:02.000
So

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
That still doesn't matter

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
If no one can see them

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
Only so many people can come to your house

37:08.000 --> 37:09.000
Sorry sorry

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
If we have any more people in this house

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
It's gonna violate the fire code

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
And the marshal's gonna come down here

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
We don't want any of that stuff

37:17.000 --> 37:18.000
You know what I mean?

37:18.000 --> 37:19.000
Just

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
Don't want to mess with that

37:21.000 --> 37:22.000
Alright let's move on

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
We're gonna get into some actual video game news here

37:24.000 --> 37:25.000
Of course our chatroom

37:25.000 --> 37:26.000
chat.orangelaunchy.com

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
If you want to join us live on this Sunday evening

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
Real quick housekeeping

37:30.000 --> 37:33.000
I may not be here in a couple weeks

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
So we may have a guest host in a couple weeks

37:35.000 --> 37:36.000
I don't know I've talked to the other hosts about that

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
I'm not gonna be here in a couple weeks

37:38.000 --> 37:39.000
Which week's that?

37:39.000 --> 37:40.000
Is that the 17th?

37:40.000 --> 37:41.000
Yes

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
Maybe we're not gonna be here at all that week

37:43.000 --> 37:44.000
Where are you gonna be?

37:44.000 --> 37:45.000
I'm not gonna be anywhere

37:45.000 --> 37:46.000
But my wife's gonna be somewhere

37:46.000 --> 37:47.000
Okay gotcha

37:47.000 --> 37:48.000
She's going to a wedding

37:48.000 --> 37:52.000
Well then I'm gonna safely say we are probably not gonna be here at all on the 17th

37:52.000 --> 37:53.000
Which is in two weeks

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
Because that is also the night I need to be out

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
I am going in for Mensa testing though on the 16th

37:57.000 --> 37:58.000
Which is pretty awesome

37:58.000 --> 37:59.000
Mensa testing?

37:59.000 --> 38:00.000
Yes Mensa testing

38:00.000 --> 38:01.000
What?

38:01.000 --> 38:02.000
Okay I have to know more about this

38:02.000 --> 38:03.000
Why are you taking the Mensa test?

38:03.000 --> 38:04.000
It's fun

38:04.000 --> 38:08.000
Did you just sit there and you were just kind of like watching the Food Network

38:08.000 --> 38:09.000
And then suddenly it just dawns on you?

38:09.000 --> 38:10.000
I should take the Mensa test

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
I don't even remember what it was

38:12.000 --> 38:15.000
Somehow I got directed to the test that's on their website

38:15.000 --> 38:16.000
And I did really well on that

38:16.000 --> 38:19.000
And I've been playing around with their iPhone app

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
And I was just like eh you know this is all good and all

38:21.000 --> 38:24.000
But I want to actually try the real test

38:24.000 --> 38:28.000
And I mean even just looking at what questions

38:28.000 --> 38:31.000
I mean obviously the questions in the app aren't necessarily the same questions

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
But they have the similar types of questions

38:33.000 --> 38:36.000
I don't see how it's really a valid IQ test

38:36.000 --> 38:41.000
Because you really only have to be good at answering certain types of questions

38:41.000 --> 38:42.000
And that's it

38:42.000 --> 38:43.000
Only you Loki

38:43.000 --> 38:44.000
This is so typical of you on the show

38:44.000 --> 38:47.000
You're openly questioning why anyone would want to become a Mensa member

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
Yet you're scheduled to take the test

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
No I just want it I just want you know hey

38:51.000 --> 38:54.000
Listen I just want to try it just for the hell of it

38:54.000 --> 38:57.000
And you know hey if I if I'm accepted into it

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
Great that's something else to put on my resume

38:59.000 --> 39:03.000
Whatever it doesn't matter

39:03.000 --> 39:04.000
I want to take the Mensa test

39:04.000 --> 39:05.000
You should

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
It's 40 bucks

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
40 bucks you got to go to a there's a guy

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
That's how much brain age costs right?

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
There's a guy does it once a month down in Dixon

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
And you just go down there and you go take the test

39:15.000 --> 39:18.000
It's an hour and a half and that's it

39:18.000 --> 39:21.000
I don't think Rob should take it

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
Why? Because then I'm gonna fail and I'm gonna cry

39:23.000 --> 39:24.000
Is that why?

39:24.000 --> 39:31.000
If you pass whatever sort of weird totally irrational opinion you ever have in your life

39:31.000 --> 39:32.000
Politically or for anything else

39:32.000 --> 39:36.000
Well I'm a member of Mensa so I think maybe that my opinion

39:36.000 --> 39:37.000
Listen all you got to be

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
Is a bit more important than yours

39:39.000 --> 39:40.000
All you have to be good at

39:40.000 --> 39:43.000
I mean it's seriously it's mostly math and it's mostly pattern finding

39:43.000 --> 39:48.000
So if you can find patterns and kind of think little you know a little bit out of the box I guess

39:48.000 --> 39:51.000
That's it you'll be fine

39:51.000 --> 39:56.000
And once again I still don't understand how it's really a valid

39:56.000 --> 39:59.000
Whatever though I'll take it I'll take the test

39:59.000 --> 40:04.000
I probably won't you know quality because you have to be in the 98th percentile of the United States

40:04.000 --> 40:07.000
In order to you know be accepted in there

40:07.000 --> 40:10.000
So I'd assume that's probably close to getting everything correctly

40:10.000 --> 40:15.000
Many years ago I went on a date with a guy who was in Mensa and he had the magazine on his table

40:15.000 --> 40:19.000
Like you know it was one of those like you know coffee table discussion pieces

40:19.000 --> 40:20.000
I always thought

40:20.000 --> 40:25.000
Well okay let me put it this way like if you join Mensa and stuff they have a bunch of different functions to get out

40:25.000 --> 40:26.000
Nothing sounded interesting at all

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
Is there like a Mensa prom?

40:28.000 --> 40:33.000
I don't know about that they have dating though like a dating thing you can date other Mensa members

40:33.000 --> 40:41.000
It's stupid but it'd be cool to put on like you know to get the little you know award or whatever the hell they have

40:41.000 --> 40:46.000
They're all hey you've been accepted in you know that'd be kind of cool but you know beyond

40:46.000 --> 40:50.000
Do I really want to be like a functioning member? Fuck that

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
I want to be a member of that society

40:52.000 --> 40:55.000
Well now are you gonna get excommunicated from Mensa if any of the members here at this program?

40:55.000 --> 40:58.000
Eh no

40:58.000 --> 41:03.000
Well I've had um I've used to get letters all the time to go take the test

41:03.000 --> 41:07.000
I never wanted to do it because I thought it was stupid and pretentious

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
All these fucking smart people I'm just sitting here going

41:09.000 --> 41:14.000
If you can bring your Mensa card to like Coldstone and get a buck off it's like yeah hell yeah

41:14.000 --> 41:19.000
Free side of pancakes at Denny's because fucking Mensa card hell yeah

41:19.000 --> 41:20.000
Smart people got it going on

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
Yeah is Mensa like AAA will they come change my tire?

41:22.000 --> 41:26.000
I think it's like AAA

41:26.000 --> 41:29.000
I don't know so we'll see we'll see what ends up happening there

41:29.000 --> 41:37.000
I probably won't pass it I mean because there's there's a certain type of question from from playing the game

41:37.000 --> 41:40.000
There's a certain type of question that stumps me usually

41:40.000 --> 41:43.000
It's because it's a lot of it and they only do certain types

41:43.000 --> 41:49.000
It's a few rows of numbers and at the very end there's you know there's four rows of four

41:49.000 --> 41:53.000
And you're supposed to figure out what the pattern is between all of them

41:53.000 --> 41:58.000
And a lot of it has to do okay well it's this number times this number with the digits reversed added together

41:58.000 --> 42:03.000
You know minus this times this and you're supposed to figure it out basically you have a minute of questions

42:03.000 --> 42:08.000
So you have to figure out this really ridiculous you know pattern in that time

42:08.000 --> 42:13.000
And a lot of times I'm unable to do it really quickly

42:13.000 --> 42:17.000
Although I've gone back though and actually looked at some of these and go okay so that's how they're doing it

42:17.000 --> 42:21.000
And you find you know I don't know if it's breaking the test or anything

42:21.000 --> 42:24.000
And you find there's certain patterns to the way they ask questions and stuff

42:24.000 --> 42:29.000
And okay I got to look for these types of things up there it is and way you go

42:29.000 --> 42:35.000
So I don't know it's it just sounds interesting a challenge or something I don't know

42:35.000 --> 42:38.000
Well I'm busy this month but if you if you go next month let me know I'll go

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
Yeah it's on the 16th this month

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
Wow that's a horrible day I can't do that day

42:42.000 --> 42:43.000
Okay

42:43.000 --> 42:46.000
Maybe next month all right Randy's in our chat room at chat.orangelandraday.com

42:46.000 --> 42:51.000
And says sky at the Mensa test this is like brain age right this is me at the Mensa test

42:51.000 --> 42:54.000
Red, yellow, blue

42:54.000 --> 42:55.000
It's really

42:55.000 --> 42:56.000
Blue

42:56.000 --> 42:57.000
A big

42:57.000 --> 42:58.000
Bro

42:58.000 --> 42:59.000
It's really a big IQ test

42:59.000 --> 43:00.000
Yeah

43:00.000 --> 43:01.000
That's all it is

43:01.000 --> 43:04.000
I know I wasn't gifted and talented when I was a kid that counts for something right

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
Right

43:06.000 --> 43:07.000
Yeah

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
I can get a dollar off at Coldstone right all right

43:09.000 --> 43:13.000
Akuma JP in our chat room says just show them your boobs and that's it pass

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
I don't I don't know if that would work

43:15.000 --> 43:16.000
Yeah

43:16.000 --> 43:22.000
I don't think that's how it works all right anyhow let's move on actually get into some gaming news tonight

43:22.000 --> 43:23.000
All right

43:23.000 --> 43:28.000
Mensa talk was way better than talking about the Twitter and the Facebook and all that

43:28.000 --> 43:33.000
I can just picture our mailbag now though filling up with emails you don't understand Mensa you're very rude

43:33.000 --> 43:40.000
No I understand it completely I'm just you know I want to become a member but I want to become a

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
You just want a gold star next to your name

43:42.000 --> 43:48.000
Okay I want to become a non-participating member of Mensa is that is that too much to ask

43:48.000 --> 43:54.000
I just want to be on the roster I don't necessarily want to go to the meetings I don't want to attend some Mensa conference

43:54.000 --> 44:00.000
Don't care I don't care about talking about political issues I just want the damn you know badge or whatever

44:00.000 --> 44:01.000
Just put it on your resume

44:01.000 --> 44:02.000
Exactly

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
All right how about gaming news video games hello

44:04.000 --> 44:12.000
All right well I guess I should be sad about this but uh Mega Man universe has been canceled

44:12.000 --> 44:20.000
That's right it's the game that was basically kind of a remade Mega Man 2 with some customizable characters

44:20.000 --> 44:28.000
And user created levels and really didn't look that great in my opinion but some people were really gung-ho about it

44:28.000 --> 44:38.000
It's canceled too bad so sad their decision I guess was caused by various circumstances that's such a detailed explanation

44:38.000 --> 44:48.000
And of course they're saying that maybe that has to do with the departure of the Mega Man creator and you know the universe lead designer Kenji Inafune

44:48.000 --> 45:04.000
So I don't know it it just looked like Mega Man powered up just you know on PC or whatever Xbox Live Arcade now with like ooh it's character Mega Man you know

45:04.000 --> 45:08.000
Interesting idea but I mean they could

45:08.000 --> 45:17.000
It looked interesting to me so of course I'm a little bit disappointed that it got canceled but at the same time if the game really did suck then they did the right thing

45:17.000 --> 45:25.000
You know and it's tough to say that because you know I'm excited about the prospect of a new Mega Man game but even I have to admit it was a little weird when they had that trailer with Ryu in it

45:25.000 --> 45:30.000
And like you know suddenly the other Capcom characters are in Mega Man universe it's like what the fuck is this game

45:30.000 --> 45:38.000
No it would have been cool though if they had all that stuff but see here's my problem is it's basically remade Mega Man they had remade Mega Man 2 levels

45:38.000 --> 45:47.000
If it's Mega Man universe it should be all the fucking games all of the levels all of the bosses you know something like that where you can have your customized character but you're fighting

45:47.000 --> 45:55.000
You know how I don't even know how many you know boss characters it would be but just like you know almost a hundred you know different characters

45:55.000 --> 46:03.000
Well remember when we only knew the title and nothing else that's what most people were speculating it was is that oh Mega Man universe is finally gonna be that clusterfuck game

46:03.000 --> 46:11.000
Yeah it would be really awesome like okay well let's see what you know this weapon does to this character from a different game you know and stuff like that

46:11.000 --> 46:21.000
I mean it actually if I remember correctly I think Mega Man 2 did have that kind of in when you're going through the Wily stages where they have the old you know one characters and you have to figure out what weapons did what

46:21.000 --> 46:30.000
I don't believe the one character's ever showed up in two it's the two characters showed up in three you had to replay the stages in the corner stages in three I remember that it's weird

46:30.000 --> 46:42.000
Got it okay I was close anyways but yeah something like that it's just they're not gonna do that because because he just it's like giving away too much I guess

46:42.000 --> 46:52.000
Oh well too bad not coming out but we're still getting Mega Man Legends 3 right yeah it's still be supposed to be coming out of that 3DS at some point

46:52.000 --> 46:59.000
One reason to own a 3DS I suppose I am very looking forward to that Legends was awesome

46:59.000 --> 47:06.000
Alright well some news going on with the Xbox there is a new dashboard apparently on the way and there's a preview that was being rolled out

47:06.000 --> 47:15.000
Major Nelson had put out the call on his blog that there is going to be another Xbox 360 I guess beta test if you will they call it a preview program it's basically a beta test

47:15.000 --> 47:21.000
Where you know they did this a little while ago with the new experience I think they did it again with the new Netflix and all that

47:21.000 --> 47:33.000
Yeah I did it last time when they have that and I didn't do it this time for a couple reasons well mainly because I hated having to update my system all the damn time

47:33.000 --> 47:40.000
Because it would be like oh you got another update oh you got another update and you know all these updates rolling out a few times a day and it was annoying

47:40.000 --> 47:49.000
And seriously not worth my getting a copy of Halo Reach even if it is in this new format and I am kind of curious to see what the new format is

47:49.000 --> 47:52.000
I don't know it's just not really worth it

47:52.000 --> 47:59.000
Well what's also interesting about this beta test program everybody is getting a free copy of Halo Reach with it so you know there is definitely something in it for folks here

47:59.000 --> 48:05.000
And the reason why it's coming with Halo Reach is because there is a new disk format that's basically being beta tested with this whole thing

48:05.000 --> 48:15.000
And that you know a lot of people are kind of assuming oh well this is to basically prevent copy you know don't copy that floppy and the piracy all that stuff this is there to update that

48:15.000 --> 48:21.000
And that is probably true that's a big part of this as well but apparently there is something else going on

48:21.000 --> 48:29.000
This is from a website called Digital Foundry apparently saying that the new disk format that Microsoft is going to put in this new Xbox update

48:29.000 --> 48:36.000
It's going to give an extra gigabyte of the disk back so they are basically creating a new gig of space on the disk

48:36.000 --> 48:41.000
I don't know if that's like maybe using the outside layer or maybe some type of copy protection they were using

48:41.000 --> 48:45.000
They had a video partition or something like that or a certain partition that was in there

48:45.000 --> 48:52.000
Actually it was kind of weird I think it was either the security partition or like the video partition

48:52.000 --> 48:59.000
Here it is there was over a gigabyte dedicated to a DVD video partition that also contained anti-piracy security sectors

48:59.000 --> 49:05.000
So that is going to be drastically reduced or admitted completely so it will free up more space on the disk

49:05.000 --> 49:11.000
What this will mean in the immediate future I don't know but it does mean an extra gig can be packed in

49:11.000 --> 49:17.000
That would only seem to really affect I mean I don't know like a lot of RPGs that go beyond a disk have just gone multi-disk

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
Like Lost Odyssey had fucking four disks

49:19.000 --> 49:25.000
Yeah but there is certain games that maybe because it is really expensive to put out multi-disk games

49:25.000 --> 49:32.000
For games that are getting close to that and they have to compress all their stuff or they have to cut out things because there is not room on a single disk

49:32.000 --> 49:37.000
Or whatever it is that they are trying to put out this way it gives them at least an extra gig of space to work with

49:37.000 --> 49:44.000
And not every company fills up at this completely so it would make sense and really they could get rid of that stupid video partition

49:44.000 --> 49:55.000
Because who cares? Okay so I pop this in my DVD player because I am an idiot and it comes up with some Xbox logo

49:55.000 --> 49:56.000
That doesn't say that this is

49:56.000 --> 50:01.000
Oh is that what happens? I have never thought to put an Xbox 360 disk in a regular DVD player

50:01.000 --> 50:07.000
So it is that video partition and so it will go oh this is an Xbox disk you have to play it in your Xbox 360

50:07.000 --> 50:10.000
Well how about you just don't do that and then all it will do is it can't re-disk

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
Or just have a picture

50:12.000 --> 50:15.000
Hey idiot this is for an Xbox 360, bye

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
It could just be a static picture

50:17.000 --> 50:21.000
Well it pretty much is a picture I am surprised that it takes a gigabyte of space for that

50:21.000 --> 50:25.000
I mean it seems like an awful lot for just a little picture

50:25.000 --> 50:33.000
SSJ100Matt in our chatroom at chat.orangelandradi.com is asking so will these free copies of Halo Reach go towards its overall sales numbers

50:33.000 --> 50:39.000
Think maybe throwing back a little bit to when they were giving Guitar Hero Van Halen free with Guitar Hero 5 remember that

50:39.000 --> 50:44.000
Yes but it doesn't really matter at this point anyways because I mean the sales of it has probably dropped quite a bit

50:44.000 --> 50:48.000
SolarFlare in our chatroom says it will still be behind Blu-Ray though, interesting point

50:48.000 --> 50:56.000
You know that is one thing that holds the Xbox 360 back a little bit you know we do have a lot of companies that want to port their games to both systems

50:56.000 --> 51:03.000
So I bet there's a lot of games out there on the PS3 that aren't really realizing their full potential of Blu-Ray

51:03.000 --> 51:08.000
And this will not just help the 360 games expand but I think it will help the PS3 ports expand too right

51:08.000 --> 51:20.000
No I mean a little bit maybe but I don't really think it's going to make a huge difference because if those companies are holding back their ports just because of space issues

51:20.000 --> 51:28.000
Or if they're porting it to multiple systems using the same assets then it's not a huge deal I don't think

51:28.000 --> 51:35.000
If they really wanted to they could just uncompress everything for the Blu-Ray but with Blu-Ray the whole problem was that it's slow

51:35.000 --> 51:45.000
Especially that data on the inside is really slow compared to the stuff on the edge of the disk

51:45.000 --> 51:54.000
So it's just I don't know I don't think it's going to make a huge difference there's not a lot of games that utilize all the space on there as well

51:54.000 --> 52:02.000
Let me close on this question here for this story, SolarFlare in our chatroom asks are they trying to make time to having to break out the next gen console

52:02.000 --> 52:07.000
You know we have noticed a lot of in this generation of games and you know part of it you can blame on the recession

52:07.000 --> 52:13.000
Part of it is this whole 10 year cycle or whatever they're talking about but you have noticed that especially the 360 has had its life extended

52:13.000 --> 52:19.000
A couple times here with Kinect and now maybe this is another step to try and breathe another year or two into it

52:19.000 --> 52:25.000
It probably is just to help the developers out a little bit because you know there's space issues with you know what's on the disk

52:25.000 --> 52:32.000
And it's it's just probably something they looked at and go do we really need this no okay let's get rid of it then we can free up all the space for our developers

52:32.000 --> 52:37.000
I'm sure they would dig that so you know that's probably what it's all about

52:37.000 --> 52:43.000
Alright well let's move on with some more news I think DarkSakura has some more Xbox news for us

52:43.000 --> 52:51.000
I do if I don't drop my mic this actually has to do with the live indie games issue on Xbox live about the ratings

52:51.000 --> 52:57.000
You know we had said that we had a feeling of the ratings were kind of fixed you know that they might have been manipulated

52:57.000 --> 53:08.000
And it turns out that it actually might be the XNA creators club excuse me actually tweeted that and I quote

53:08.000 --> 53:15.000
We are investigating a possible misuse of ratings on XBLG titles will announce more information here as it develops

53:15.000 --> 53:24.000
So basically it's been coming to people's attention that ratings have gone from you know really high to just dropping drastically

53:24.000 --> 53:27.000
And so they're fairly certain that there's manipulation behind it

53:27.000 --> 53:38.000
So is the most so if the fraud is true is it being used to bolster the ratings of games that maybe are terrible or to lower stuff that competitors don't get by

53:38.000 --> 53:46.000
It wasn't necessarily that they were being well they were being manipulated but it wasn't by the whim of a certain publisher

53:46.000 --> 53:52.000
Basically it was that one lacrosse game that was on there they tweeted their fellows hey give us a five star rating

53:52.000 --> 53:58.000
Well the people that are fans of the game also took it upon themselves to rate the other games one star that were in the area

53:58.000 --> 54:11.000
So they you know inadvertently created like you know ratings fixing almost but it's just because there's no real system in place to where you have to purchase the game in order to rate it

54:11.000 --> 54:12.000
And that kind of stuff

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
Oh yeah I guess that's true

54:14.000 --> 54:15.000
So you can just rate it regardless

54:15.000 --> 54:21.000
Yeah it seems to be highly unfair that someone should be able to rate something that they haven't played so

54:21.000 --> 54:29.000
Yeah because I thought that you you know spent your one to three bucks or your two to four hundred whatever microsoft space bucks

54:29.000 --> 54:36.000
I'm like wow this is terrible and then you can give it two stars after you've at least played the demo or bought it but I guess not

54:36.000 --> 54:37.000
Yeah

54:37.000 --> 54:38.000
You can just do what you want

54:38.000 --> 54:43.000
Well they're looking into it apparently so maybe they'll realize that was one big oversight

54:43.000 --> 54:50.000
To be honest doesn't iTunes have that same problem I mean I could go in and rate podcasts to one that I've never listened to

54:50.000 --> 54:56.000
Well not with the apps I think that you're given I think you can only rate them after you've used them

54:56.000 --> 54:57.000
Perhaps

54:57.000 --> 55:00.000
I know that if you delete an app it asks you to rate it

55:00.000 --> 55:01.000
Yeah

55:01.000 --> 55:02.000
So

55:02.000 --> 55:05.000
Which by the way you should leave Orange Knobs Radio a five star review on iTunes

55:05.000 --> 55:06.000
Do it

55:06.000 --> 55:11.000
Yes we actually had a couple nice ones this past week so thank you guys for doing that really appreciate it

55:11.000 --> 55:18.000
That kind of stuff does help because when we get more five star reviews on iTunes it kind of like bumps you up in the listing and you know just helps us get more exposure

55:18.000 --> 55:21.000
Add more people to our chat room and make it a bigger party on Sunday nights

55:21.000 --> 55:24.000
We need to be as exposed as Malina's boobs

55:24.000 --> 55:25.000
If not more so

55:25.000 --> 55:26.000
Yeah

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
That's right alright moving on Loki

55:28.000 --> 55:29.000
Yeah

55:29.000 --> 55:34.000
Oh by the way the people doing this total dicks I forgot to say that earlier

55:34.000 --> 55:43.000
Another cancellation story this isn't a big surprise because this has been delayed forever and I remember playing it back a couple

55:43.000 --> 55:52.000
God how many E3's ago was that that I actually played this but Sony online entertainment has confirmed that they have cancelled the agency

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
It will not be coming out

55:57.000 --> 56:05.000
You know it was delayed forever it was a spy MMO kind of a cool little game but oh well

56:05.000 --> 56:11.000
Man I'm just keeping sad trombone open in a window tonight because there's a lot of just cancellation news

56:11.000 --> 56:27.000
Kind of alluding to what I was talking about before when we were talking about Free Realms they're also saying that the company is discontinuing production of the title to focus on developing resources on delivering two new MMOs based on its renowned PlanetSide and EverQuest properties

56:27.000 --> 56:38.000
Which while also maintaining its current portfolio of online games so you know maybe a new free to play you know EverQuest because

56:38.000 --> 56:43.000
I'm surprised just a straight up port of the first EverQuest game hasn't shown up on PS3 yet

56:43.000 --> 56:48.000
Because there's still shit tons of people playing old school EverQuest there's what like 20 something expansions it's crazy

56:48.000 --> 56:51.000
But you know people invested a lot in that game

56:51.000 --> 56:59.000
It's the same reason that it's so important what Blizzard does next with their next MMO because you know this titan thing or whatever it is they're doing

56:59.000 --> 57:06.000
They have to be very careful because they don't want to cannibalize wow but they might you know it's weird

57:06.000 --> 57:11.000
I got an email a couple weeks ago from Ultima Online which I think I demoed way back in the day

57:11.000 --> 57:20.000
So you know yeah new loyalty mount for like as if you have a concurrent subscription like City of Heroes does that for how long you've been paying for the game

57:20.000 --> 57:23.000
For Ultima Online when did that come out?

57:23.000 --> 57:26.000
I was one of the first MMOs period

57:26.000 --> 57:30.000
It was probably like 99 it was a long time ago

57:30.000 --> 57:35.000
Yeah it was like 12 or 13 year loyalty mount

57:35.000 --> 57:42.000
Okay yeah so if they're still around then so is the EverQuest people yeah

57:42.000 --> 57:50.000
Boy oh boy that is and yeah I think it's when you invest so much time into something it's hard to walk away from it

57:50.000 --> 57:58.000
And for me that's a lot of wow it's hard for me I was really interested in DC Universe but I've been having a hard time saying I'm gonna really invest this time in DC Universe

57:58.000 --> 58:02.000
Because all my friends are on wow this is tough

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
Just type a slash played and see

58:04.000 --> 58:13.000
Oh cry all right Spassinator in our chat room says the agency being canceled how the flying fuck can anyone not see that coming

58:13.000 --> 58:20.000
Well I don't know I don't know if I would say I saw it coming I did notice it was an awfully long development cycle

58:20.000 --> 58:27.000
But MMOs on consoles have just become so unpredictable like and most of the news is really bad

58:27.000 --> 58:34.000
And I don't like what are they doing wrong why why do consoles just seem to not be able to get MMOs

58:34.000 --> 58:41.000
The lone exception being probably DC Universe maybe Final Fantasy 11 but that game is a little old now

58:41.000 --> 58:46.000
So what is it about consoles that MMOs just aren't fucking working

58:46.000 --> 58:56.000
I think that games on consoles are more serialized that they have a beginning and an end even if it's a God of War or an RPG that takes 80 hours to beat

58:56.000 --> 59:02.000
You get to the ending you play it again you get the alternate ending and you're done and you move on to the next title

59:02.000 --> 59:09.000
Console games is all about how much I want to say like it like it's an assembly line of just how many games you can churn through in a certain amount of time

59:09.000 --> 59:13.000
But you know you you buy certain amount of games in a year and you want to get through them all

59:13.000 --> 59:18.000
Whereas an MMO is really open-ended you never get to the end of wow

59:18.000 --> 59:25.000
And that's sort of the culture or the attitude that piece that more is more appropriate for PCs if that makes sense

59:25.000 --> 59:36.000
I'm with you to a point but then I ask what about Halo where it thrives on it's at least you know the older games especially to thrived on online

59:36.000 --> 59:40.000
Which didn't really have a beginning in the end maybe maybe a match had a beginning and an end I don't know

59:40.000 --> 59:43.000
Well yeah those are broken up into matches

59:43.000 --> 59:50.000
Because I guess sports are somehow different and Halo is kind of like a sport IDK

59:50.000 --> 59:57.000
Yeah I don't know Game Guru in our chat room flat out says because it is not wow

59:57.000 --> 01:00:04.000
I don't know you know as much you know I'm a big supporter of wow although I don't always agree with everything Blizzard does

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:11.000
But you know I think there's room for more than one you know a game like DC Universe I don't think it's a failure

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:14.000
I don't know how that game has been selling I think it's been doing okay

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:20.000
But right now okay in the console universe is better than anything else right now

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:21.000
Than nokay?

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Yeah than nokay

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:27.000
Eve Online is still kicking doesn't have wow's numbers but it's definitely got its market share

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.000
There's people still doing Perfect World

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
Final Fantasy 11 still has supporters

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:31.000
Guild Wars

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:37.000
Shit Ultima Online and EverQuest still have lots of people to play

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
Lineage 2 still a fucking huge game

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
That's really big in Korea

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:42.000
Yeah just not here in the US

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:51.000
So let's see going to our chat room again Brad from Pod Culture says wouldn't Phantasy Star Online count kinda

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:58.000
Well I thought it was cool that Sega actually let people transfer their characters to private servers

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:05.000
That was cool and so it was like well we have to close it but I know there's still people doing it

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:08.000
And there was Phantasy Star Universe was going on

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Yeah true but Phantasy Star Universe I don't think was ever

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:13.000
I know people who are still playing it

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:14.000
Really? I just wouldn't think

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
Although by people I mean Julie

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.000
One person

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:23.000
Phantasy Star Online back in the Dreamcast especially and don't get me wrong I love Phantasy Star Online my god

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:30.000
It really just kinda like set the tone I think in a way for MMOs and I think a lot of MMOs wouldn't exist today if it wasn't for PSO

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
I love PSO

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:36.000
I don't know like in a way PSO isn't even really an MMO to me

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:40.000
No it's more like you run these rooms okay you're done

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:41.000
Yeah

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
You hang out with your friends making weird emoticons

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Yeah

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:45.000
And then you dance

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:49.000
PSO always felt a lot like Diablo to me for some weird reason

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
The whole random dungeon crawling

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:56.000
I actually I really started liking PSO when I started playing online

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
I'm sorry on the computer

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:04.000
You know what I think really hurt PSO you know what really really hurt that franchise more than anything I think

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:05.000
PSU

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:09.000
No I would say it was before that I would say it was the GameCube game

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:15.000
Because Nintendo just aborted online support

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:25.000
Literally told Sega sure we'll help you out with this you know MMO thing and put out this broadband adapter or anything and then Nintendo just basically said ah fuck it

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:26.000
LOLJK

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:32.000
No here's what I think was even worse the Dreamcast version in the US no online play

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:36.000
You had to do this little thing to manipulate it to get it to play online

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:39.000
Because it wouldn't support the broadband adapter

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Yeah I imported that or I did something where

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
Yeah I could play the Dreamcast one online

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:45.000
I had the ethernet

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.000
I had the modem though

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:52.000
Well no we had that too it was it was like it was something that you had to manipulate in the menu

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:58.000
The DNS I think or that your IP you had to put in something to force it to go out through the ethernet

01:02:58.000 --> 01:02:59.000
Yeah

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:00.000
You had to do something to it to get it to work

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:05.000
I don't remember having that problem I just remember it working ah whatever it's been so long

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:15.000
Well I guess and also going back to the agency thematically a spy MMO I don't know something about MMOs is you have to even in fantasy star online you're not killing literal dragons

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:21.000
But it's whimsical fantasy sci-fi you know no one wants to get together with their five friends and smuggle microfiche

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:27.000
Matrix online ended anything that I've noticed well the city of heroes is still going Star Trek online is still going strong

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:31.000
I love Star Trek online in fact I need to pay for a month but

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:35.000
Yeah I don't I don't think MMO has to be swords and dragons and mystical stuff

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:36.000
It has to be fantasy

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:44.000
Yeah it's just I think the other that's a tried and true method that's an established formula that's a formula that's working right now

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:47.000
That's WoW's formula in a way I think

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
But now they have goblins with motorcycles

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:57.000
I think we haven't really seen the other type but then again Eve online is not is a space game DC Universe not really dragons

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:04.000
Star Trek online totally different thing but Star Trek's a whole separate fandom too you know like

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:14.000
Well and the fact that they're getting so much right in Star Trek online they're really playing to continuity fans and sort of getting

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:20.000
I mean I hated enterprise but they are incorporating the better parts of enterprise into the game

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:28.000
And it's got something for the fans that's the big thing is that the people that are playing Star Trek online are Star Trek fans

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:34.000
Alright let's move on from MMO chat we're running a little long because of MMO chat let's do some other quick stories here

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:40.000
I got a story about GameStop and GameStop apparently has bought absorbed some more companies

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:47.000
They bought spawn labs and they've also bought a company called impulse now what the hell did these things do

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:58.000
Okay spawn labs they did this high def box set that apparently I guess it sounds to me a lot like the whole online system

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:03.000
It's kind of similar to that so that's you know one thing they've absorbed and then they also got impulse

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:10.000
Which apparently is going to have three parts to it which is the client the impulse client which you can use to download games

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:15.000
The reactor which is like DRM management and copy protection and all of that

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:20.000
Letting the developers do achievement friends list and all the kind of like steam xbox

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:21.000
Sounds like a steam clone

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:26.000
And then impulse publisher which is real time reporting and management tools

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:33.000
GameStop has bought these companies so in a way I sort of see this as them thinking ahead a little bit

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:40.000
Because these companies have more to do with online distribution and something that isn't so much the stores

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:45.000
You know they did not buy stores in this acquisition well they did but it's a different type you know

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:50.000
So I have a feeling they are thinking ahead as to this whole how do we counter digital distribution

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
They're absorbing more and more into their collective

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:58.000
A little bit yes but you know it doesn't mean all the mall stores are going to shut down next week

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:04.000
But I don't know this digital distribution thing if I was kind of in this GameStop industry I'd be a little freaked out right now

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:09.000
Well maybe not right this second but you know five years from now this could be

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:13.000
Just makes me think of Blockbuster and Netflix when Netflix first came out

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:18.000
Is this you know Johnny come lately by mail oh who's going to use that

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:25.000
Blockbuster hopped on that bandwagon but they did it too late but I think they hopped on it early enough to save them past Hollywood's demise

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:30.000
Right so I feel like GameStop you know and again I don't mean to like panic people or whatever this is years away

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:35.000
You know these things happening but GameStop buying this I think they're trying to kind of put themselves in a position

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:40.000
Where they are like Blockbuster got in on it early that's what this seems like to me

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:41.000
They're setting up a safety net

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:42.000
Yeah

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:49.000
That we know because if I don't have any details because I really don't think I know any more store managers

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:55.000
But from what I've noticed I'll go into a GameStop you know and it'll be dead empty

01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:00.000
There'll be no one in there and I think that it's just first of all a sign of the economy and another thing

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:06.000
And this this is actually I'm not going to go into it because it's a little bit more on the cycle psychology level

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:13.000
But I think that people are becoming more isolated wanting to do more things from home

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:17.000
Not wanting to go out amongst people you know what I mean

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:24.000
That that's why online services have become so popular you know people need to get out of the house

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:29.000
See I have to play devil's advocate here though a little bit the one by his house in South San Francisco always packed

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
The one in that mall what is that mall called?

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:32.000
Well yeah but that's in the mall

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:33.000
ceremony

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:34.000
I'm talking about strip mall places

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:35.000
Oh okay

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:36.000
They're dead

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
I don't really go to a lot of those yeah

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:42.000
Well Dan will randomly let's go buy this store number because he knows all the store numbers

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:43.000
Uh-huh

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:48.000
I'll be like okay well which one's that oh it's the one over here then why didn't you just say that was the one over there

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:49.000
So

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:53.000
Let's see go into our chat I'm going to chat on orangeontraday.com

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:56.000
SolarFlare says they're going to have to do some good stuff to compete with steam

01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:01.000
I think that's what part of all this is is to really align themselves in a way where they can

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:09.000
Maybe they'll start doing this thing in the store where you know buy the copy in the store and get some type of digital download thing

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:13.000
The free costume or you know something extra maybe that's kind of where they're going

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:14.000
We'll see

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:17.000
All right moving on dark soccer what do you got for us

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:20.000
Well we have some news out of Japan

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:23.000
Oh which is where video games come from

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:32.000
Oh and it's a new Super Mario Brothers Wii arcade cabinet that's being developed by Capcom

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:37.000
Yeah it's Super Mario Brothers Wii Coin World

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:42.000
It's a four player game where you earn medals by participating in mini games so kind of

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:43.000
It's Mario Party

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:47.000
Kind of Mario Party-ish I say ish

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
Not too much running and jumping

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:56.000
And it actually is on Capcom of Japan's website there's a trailer and everything

01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:01.000
And I'm just like why is Capcom doing it but then again Capcom is

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:06.000
Nintendo hasn't ever really been much in the arcade scene except for the play choice

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
Oh that was years ago though

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
Arcades are not even the same thing now

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:15.000
In fact I more think this is news worthy as oh arcade games are still popular somewhere in the world

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:19.000
But I think it's actually neat that they've got that relationship with Capcom to do it

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:22.000
Because Capcom does put out good quality

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:26.000
Who did the Mario Kart sit down driver game that's at

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:30.000
Namco because you can play as Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man in that

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:31.000
All right yes I thought

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
So yeah Namco did that

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:36.000
So yeah it's not totally unheard of that's a good example

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:40.000
It's not totally unheard of that other companies might get to do Nintendo stuff in the arcade

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:45.000
One of my favorite and most underrated arcade machines ever F-Zero

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:48.000
Which is a fucking amazing game

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:53.000
Actually the arcade machine's biggest problem was it only had six freaking tracks in it

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
And you could unlock them all at home

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:59.000
There's one of the guys that's in the Playstation hacking scene or whatever

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:02.000
He's kind of gotten out of it now but know what his thing is now

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:05.000
He's dumping the stuff for the Triforce system

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:06.000
Nice

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:09.000
Yeah of course the Triforce system was the F-Zero game

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
Because that was Nintendo, Sega, and Namco

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:12.000
This looks really fun

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:13.000
All on one

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:18.000
It's like you take a different corner and everyone's got different minigames

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
But it looks really cool

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:23.000
I'll link the website to everyone in the chatroom

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:26.000
You know how that would make millions here in the US

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:27.000
Tickets

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:28.000
Is have it spit tickets

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:29.000
Yeah

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:35.000
Gee I wonder if this will be part of New Super Mario Brothers Wii Dose

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:36.000
Maybe

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
You never know

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:45.000
Alright let's move on, travel the world, look at some release dates of actual stuff coming to a store near you

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:51.000
We're in April now so now that we've passed the fiscal end of years for a lot of companies

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:54.000
There's not a lot of companies putting out stuff

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:55.000
So here's what we've got

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:59.000
Carnival Games, Monkey See Monkey Do for the Xbox 360 and Kinect

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
That's coming out this week

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:05.000
Karaoke Revolution Glee volume 2

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:08.000
Coming out game only and with a mic

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
Sorry I just burped

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
Sorry

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:16.000
Remington Super Slam Hunting Alaska on the Wii

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
Starring Sarah Palin

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
Except not really

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:24.000
And then on the 3DS a week from today

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:28.000
Tom Clancy Splinter Cell 3D

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:34.000
And I believe Raven Grab is travel through time 3D is also coming out at the same time

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
That's it

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:37.000
Wow

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:38.000
Yeah

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
Short week

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:41.000
Alright

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
As will be much of April

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:44.000
Well

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
SSJ100 Matt says needs more bacon

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:49.000
Let's go to Japan real quick and look at the games coming out there

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:55.000
We have Bullet Soul comes out in Japan this week on the Xbox 360 and Dragon Age Origins Awakening

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:58.000
I imagine it seems like they're behind a little bit

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:02.000
Keep in mind they've got to translate that stuff into Japanese so it is a little bit behind

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
On the Playstation 3 this week

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:05.000
Nada

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
Going over to some other systems then

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
Taking a look at the Wii

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
Nothing there either

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
In fact not a lot on the horizon for the Wii

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
How about the 3DS in Japan?

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:18.000
Well you got a game called Cubic Ninja comes out this week in Japan

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:23.000
It looks like you move little boxes that have ninja looking graphics on them

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:27.000
And you, I don't know, move them around these stages and make them fall down holes

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
It looks like a puzzle game

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:35.000
Let's say it's a puzzle game, it uses the tilt controls on the 3DS and it is a 3DS game without 3D

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
Is that coming, oh really

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
It's coming out over here in June

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
Just the screenshots that I just so briefly saw

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:46.000
It kind of looked like the yellow blob on the PSP port of the Loco

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:47.000
Loco Loco?

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
Loco Loco, yeah, looked like that

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:52.000
On the PSP this week, Earth Defense Force 2 portable

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
That might be an interesting lookie

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:55.000
Awesome

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
Princess Frontier portable, awesome

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:01.000
And then a game called Are You Alice? comes out this week on the PSP

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:07.000
Hello, are you Alice? No, okay, are you Alice? No, are you Alice?

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
Regular and limited edition

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
This looks to be, it's kind of like based off an anime it looks like

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:17.000
Kind of like these chapters, looks like kind of like one of those interactive novel type things

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
Because there's regular and limited edition

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:20.000
It's a dating sim

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:21.000
Is it really?

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:22.000
I think it is

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
No, this looks too like

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:29.000
If this is a dating sim, no, the woman would not have a sword in a dating sim

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:33.000
Look at it, it's got all that text

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:34.000
Oh boy, alright

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:40.000
And there's some pretty fun, funny hentai ones out there that involve swords and dragons and tentacles

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:43.000
Coming next year from Quadratic Dream

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:44.000
Are you Jason?

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
The side story for Heavy Rain

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:49.000
Are you Jason? No, okay

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:52.000
Are you Jason? Have you seen Jason? Do you know Jason?

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:55.000
That's it for Japanese release dates

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:59.000
Well in the UK, Jack and Squat really

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:03.000
On the 5th is Red Faction Battlegrounds for Xbox 360

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:07.000
And the same thing a day later on the 6th for Playstation 3

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:12.000
And also the Dishwasher Vampire Smile on Xbox 360

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
What the crap is that?

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:20.000
Sounds like the sequel to the Dishwasher, the indie game that ended up being a real arcade release

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:21.000
Oh yeah

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
Sounds like a sequel

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:28.000
There's people in cages and a dude with a big sword

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
That is a sequel to the game

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:31.000
I would play that

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:34.000
Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
And then the classic game of the week

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:39.000
And we have a pretty big one this week

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
So we'll get to that in just a moment, but first, Loki

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:45.000
I don't know if I can report this story without fear of being sued by Namco

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:46.000
But I'm gonna do it anyways

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:51.000
Namco Bandai has filed for a couple trademarks in the Katamari franchise

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:59.000
Katamari Amore, which is filed under Katamari Amore and Katamari Amore Rolling Whopper

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:03.000
Hopefully nothing to do with Burger King

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:08.000
And I guess hints obviously that they're gonna put out another game in that series

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:13.000
And then of course there's two additional trademark applications for Time Trip and Have a Nice Trip

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:18.000
Not necessarily in the Katamari series, perhaps

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:23.000
But I guess Trip was one of the characters in Enslaved

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
So maybe it's something to do better

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:28.000
Or maybe, heaven forbid, a new IP altogether

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:29.000
I don't know

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:32.000
Maybe, or it's another Katamari game, who knows

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:35.000
Didn't the guy from Namco or whatever

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:36.000
Yeah, he left to make

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
Yeah, he made a pretty

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:41.000
The subtext was pretty clear that he was sick of the franchise after the second one

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:42.000
And he just didn't care anymore

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:45.000
They kept making them anyways, or I should say they kept rehashing them

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:48.000
Oh, I'm still playing Noby Noby Boy

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
Yeah, because that's what he did after Katamari

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:53.000
It's actually fun, people are still doing stuff on Noby Noby Boy

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:57.000
On the phone, and uploading everything to Facebook so that girl will grow

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:08.000
I hope if it's a new Katamari game it is not part of this whole jump the shark that's kind of dominated this last generation of the games

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:13.000
I'm sure we'll have a Katamari game that'll be in 3D that'll be basically the rehash levels again

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
And it's going to be on the 3DS

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
I'm sure that's going to happen eventually because

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:18.000
If it's in 3D I'll throw up

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:22.000
Because that's what they do, and whatever

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:25.000
I don't know, I can't really get excited about this stuff because

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:28.000
Even I bought the last Katamari game that was on 360

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:29.000
It was just kind of, eh

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:30.000
The 360 one was bad

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
The PS3 one's alright

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:37.000
The PS3 one's okay, but the problem with the PS3 one is that it's basically the same stuff from the first two games

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:38.000
Mixed together

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:39.000
It's kind of like

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:43.000
The Katamari game on the PS3 is like the Wilson Phillips greatest hits album

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:46.000
They only fucking had two CDs, right?

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:50.000
So there's not a lot to compile a greatest hits album from

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:54.000
Daft Punk has the greatest hits and I think they only had what, three albums?

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:55.000
Yeah

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:59.000
I guess it's kind of like that then, I don't know

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:04.000
You know, surely you've seen those one hit wonders that have these greatest hits CDs

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:08.000
When I'm discovered and released an album, I'm just gonna call it Greatest Hits

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
Like your first album will just be called Greatest Hits?

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:11.000
My first album will be Greatest Hits

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:14.000
My second one will be, well these are better than the last ones

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:18.000
You know the DDR band Erotic, which of course

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:19.000
Greatest Tits

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
Yeah, they had an album called Greatest Tits

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
I like that name

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:27.000
Moving on, one more story for me for this part of the show

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
PlayStation Rewards

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:30.000
Remember this?

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:33.000
It was a beta program that happened last year

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
And the beta is now ending

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:41.000
And this PlayStation Rewards program was supposed to be launching for all the PlayStation folks in the next month

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:45.000
But I guess Sony has decided based on what they've learned throughout the beta test

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:48.000
They do not want to roll this program out to the public yet

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:53.000
So yeah, they're gonna say, well we thank loyal and devoted customers with innovative offerings

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
But yeah, it's not happening right now

01:17:55.000 --> 01:18:00.000
In fact, they're thinking it's been delayed indefinitely

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:04.000
Now the PlayStation Rewards program was supposed to have these quests

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:07.000
And other things that go with it

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:08.000
It was supposed to be quests

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
Did you get real tangible stuff from this I think?

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:14.000
You could get pro or legendary status from this

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:17.000
And I think you got free PlayStation Pulse

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
Or move things, I don't know

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
You get little trinkets from it

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:24.000
Yeah, they've decided to delay this indefinitely so far

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:28.000
So I don't know, maybe they'll come out and say they changed their mind at E3

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:32.000
But a quote from a PlayStation representative

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:36.000
After careful consideration and evaluation following the PlayStation Rewards beta

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:39.000
We have decided not to roll out the program to the public at this time

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:43.000
We remain committed to providing the best overall consumer experience for our users

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:47.000
And we will be refocusing our efforts in the near future to further developing PlayStation Plus

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
And our other network services

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:54.000
So maybe becoming a PlayStation Plus member is all the reward they want to give you

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
That's what it sounds like anyway

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:59.000
So if you want rewards, you gotta pay for them

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:03.000
They're like, wait, we can charge people for these rewards

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:04.000
Awesome

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:07.000
Yeah, that's not a reward really, that's a sale

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
That's buying something

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:10.000
Yeah

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
Alright, well let's get to the part of the show

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:16.000
And you shouldn't really have to bribe somebody to use the different services on there

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
That's what I'm saying

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:23.000
Okay, now let's get to the part of the show where we take a stroll down memory lane

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:28.000
And revisit a classic video game from the archives in Dark Sakura

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
This one's really classic, it's kinda moldy

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:33.000
Yeah, in her quest to find the classic game of the week

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:37.000
That she thinks, hey you ungrateful bastard kids, you need to play this game right away

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:38.000
And get off my lawn

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:41.000
Alright, or mow my lawn if you're gonna stand on it

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
Yeah, mow my lawn, seriously, it frickin' needs it

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
Then get off it

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
Alright, Dark Sakura, what is the classic game of the week?

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:51.000
I think there's only one way to introduce that, and that's to play some of the dialogue off

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
Alright, let's see what I can do here

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:56.000
I think I have to fast forward a wee bit in this video to get to the dialogue

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:57.000
Here you go

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
Wow, what a mansion

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:14.000
I hope this is not Chris's blood

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:18.000
Okay, this is Resident Evil

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:23.000
And I actually did put up a sample of the redone dialogue in the GameCube version

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:26.000
That's so much better, so much better

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
I can probably get to a little bit of that here, let's see

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
What is this place?

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:36.000
Not quite your ordinary house, that's for sure

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
Hey, Wesker, where's Chris?

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:41.000
I bought the GameCube for that

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:42.000
Jill, no

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
You don't wanna go back out there

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
But we've got to be saying the same stuff

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:48.000
What was that?

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:50.000
Chris?

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:51.000
Anyway

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:52.000
No

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
I hope this is not Chris's blood

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
Master of Unlocking

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:59.000
Maybe you, the Master of Unlocking, can use this

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:00.000
Yeah

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:03.000
Let's see, so it was known as Biohazard in Japan

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:08.000
Which actually, I've got a PlayStation version of Biohazard and I have it on Saturn

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:11.000
But this one is put out by Capcom

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:16.000
And it spawned a legacy still going on today

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:19.000
It was developed by Shinji Mikami

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:24.000
And as of May 2009, it sold 40 million copies

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:29.000
So this was one of the early ones into the survival horror series

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:35.000
And you, it had a full motion intro

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:39.000
But they cut part of the intro for the American one

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:42.000
Because there is a scene where Chris pulls out his Zippo

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:45.000
Lights a cigarette and takes a drag

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:49.000
And then there's another scene where this zombie's head falls off and it looks like Michael Jordan

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
They cut that too

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
Honestly, it didn't look like Michael Jordan, guys

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
It didn't, it was stupid

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:56.000
But yeah

01:21:56.000 --> 01:22:00.000
So with this one, basically you are S.T.A.R.S. member

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:04.000
Jill Valentine or Chris Redfield

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:08.000
And you are exploring this mansion and unlocking its secrets

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
And Chris is helped by Claire

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
Was it Claire? Yeah, it was Claire

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
And she was young and perky and a medic

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:17.000
Rebecca, that was it, Claire was his sister

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
It was Rebecca

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:23.000
And Barry helps Jill

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:26.000
He also has the best line in the game

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
You are almost a Jill sandwich

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:32.000
And I hope this is not Chris's blood

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:33.000
So yeah

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:38.000
It was really, really ahead of its time when it came out

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:43.000
And there's actually other versions out

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:47.000
They did the, I think it was called

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:51.000
I'm trying to find the name of it

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:55.000
They did a redone version of it that was

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:59.000
Like a remix

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
I believe it was like a remix version

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:04.000
And they had different outfits and the items in the house were in different places

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
And the graphics were touched up a little bit

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:09.000
And then there was the GameCube version

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
Which we just heard a little bit of

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:14.000
That was completely redone, better dialogue

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:17.000
I think it still had the same voice cast though

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:21.000
But it's pretty much the original game

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:24.000
Just really, really cleaned up

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
Some of the story elements

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:29.000
They added a little bit more references to the sequel

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:32.000
And Code of Veronica, I think they fixed some of the continuity issues

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:35.000
But otherwise it was the same game

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:39.000
But even in the very first one they had a reference to Ada

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:42.000
Who was in Resident Evil 2

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
And she was really cool

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:47.000
And it also has my favorite thing in here

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
Is the diary

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
Ugly face so ate him

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:54.000
Itchy, tasty

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:57.000
Yeah, so that's where itchy tasty comes from

01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:01.000
So this one, I mean it spawned all kinds of sequels

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
You know, we had Code Veronica

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:06.000
We had Resident Evil 2 and 3, 4 and 5

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:10.000
Who remembers Dino Crisis?

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:13.000
Dino Crisis is actually pretty neat

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:20.000
It actually just announced Resident Evil Revelations for the 3DS

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:25.000
And that they had Resident Evil Portable

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
There's all kinds of versions out there

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:28.000
There's mobile games

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
I even had this on the game.com

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:34.000
I'm reminded of a

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:37.000
I'm not sure if it was the advance

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:41.000
But there was a Resident Evil novel guidance side story

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:44.000
Where it's Leon and Barry on a cruise ship, I think

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:45.000
I think you were right

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
I don't think it's canon

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:50.000
Because that's some obscure stuff

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:53.000
There were the Umbrella Chronicles, the Dark Side Chronicles

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
Resident Evil Outbreak

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:58.000
It was a mobile one, you said?

01:24:58.000 --> 01:24:59.000
Or handheld?

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:00.000
Handheld

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:05.000
There was Biohazard Eye Survivor

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:08.000
And Resident Evil Assault the Nightmare

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:12.000
You know, actually one of my favorites in the series was Gun Survivor

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
Which I got to play in the arcade

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
No, Gun Con was Namco

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
The accessory

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:21.000
Well, in Japan you could play it with the gun

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
But in the US it

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
Oh yeah, because you can't use those here

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:26.000
They're taboo

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:29.000
Which I always thought it would have been perfect to do it on the Dreamcast

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
Maybe Gun Con in the US

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:34.000
But you couldn't play Gun Survivor, you just navigated through

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:38.000
But I thought that with the D-pad that was on the gun

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
You should have been able to control with that

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:43.000
Although the arcade version was really cool because you

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
Walked by pressing forward with the gun

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:48.000
And you could back up with the gun, it was really fun

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:52.000
But the first Gun Survivor one I think was Code Veronica

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
Or was it the second one?

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
I think that was the second one

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
But that's the one I played

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:02.000
And there was also Resident Evil Operation Raccoon City

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
That was another one

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:10.000
It's supposed to be coming out on Playstation 3, Xbox 360, and on Windows

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:13.000
And Resident Evil 6 is also coming out

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:16.000
So yeah, all kinds of stuff going on

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:20.000
And then there's movies, which the movies don't really have a lot to do with the game

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
Not anymore really

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:25.000
Just a few things that are in common

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:28.000
And there were all kinds of comics that went out

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:32.000
They did a manhua, which the Code Veronica one was actually really good

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:33.000
I liked it

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
All kinds of cool stuff

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
So yeah, Resident Evil

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
Worst voice acting ever in the first one

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
But it's laughable, it's fantastic

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:45.000
And I think Resident Evil of the 3D generation of consoles

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
The Playstation 1 was the first game

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:51.000
That really spawned an entirely new genre

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
Which was survival horror

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
And we have Resident Evil to thank for Silent Hill

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
And that whole franchise

01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:01.000
I think Silent Hill took a different turn in survival horror

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
Well yeah, but just the whole dark

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
You against monsters

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
The whole scary thing

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
I think Resident Evil sort of laid down the foundation

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
I don't know, I always thought Friday the 13th

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
On the Nintendo spawn

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
No way, no way

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
It was Nightmare on Elm Street

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:21.000
Or maybe it was the Metal Gear

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
Which I think was always kind of

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
I don't know, it's not necessarily survival horror

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
It's survival tactics

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
Survival, tactical, dodging

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
Well that's always stealth

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
Yeah, that'd be stealth action

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
Whatever, shut up

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
But did any of those games have zombie dogs?

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
They did not

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
Okay then, zombie dogs

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
So is that it? That's it

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
Classic game of the week, Resident Evil

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
Oh, there's actually one more thing

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
Make it quick

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
That was a beta

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
Of Resident Evil 2

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
That had a different character named

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
Elza Walker and Leon

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
And she was like a motorcycle chick

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
Wearing the red and white leathers

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:05.000
And they actually ended up scrapping it

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
When it was about 60% done

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
I'm trying to get my hands on one of those

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:13.000
I think my N64 box, the console system

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
When the N64 first came out

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
You know how they have

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
On the side of the box

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
The game, like if you buy this console

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
Here are the games that are coming out

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
I have one that has a Resident Evil 1.5

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
Or 2, because it was supposed to be an N64 game

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
It was supposed to be Resident Evil 2

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
Yeah, that's on that and it never came out

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
I guess for that system

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
Because I said the backgrounds weren't interesting enough

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
But it had a lot of the same mechanics

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
From the first one

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
But they saved a few things to what eventually became the second one

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
And lost a kind of cool looking character

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
Sad face

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
That's it

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
Well that's it for your classic game of the week

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
We'll see what she picks next week

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
But for now we're going to take a quick break guys

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
We will be back in just a little bit

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
With more of Orange Lounge Radio

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
Don't go anywhere though guys

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
We've got plenty more coming up in tonight's Part B

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
We're going to talk about the 3DS

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
A little more about the launch

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
A lawsuit against EA

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
And a game called Xenoblade and its localization

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
We're going to come back to the Ultima topic

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
Because there's some really interesting news

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
So that could be very interesting

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
We're going to talk about all that right after this

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
When we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
Welcome back everybody

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
To more of Orange Lounge Radio

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000
Live on this Sunday

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
April the 3rd of 2011

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
With a 408th episode of our show

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:39.000
Let's talk quickly about our side projects that we do

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
If you like OLR

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
You might also like these shows

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
Dark Zakra

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
Comic Insanity

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
We go live on Tuesday

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
You can download the podcast at

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
Infamous.net

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
That's N-F-A-M-O-U-S dot net

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
And you can also find us on iTunes

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
It's a comic book podcast done with

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
You've heard her on the show Tiara, Mara & Marvel

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
And Dan Shadow

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
And we are very very fun

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
Listen to us

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000
Very fun

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
Also pretty fun

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
The best little Hoard House in Azeroth

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
It's a little side project

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
Xtfer and I have all about the world

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
Of Warcraft

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
www.hoardhouse.com for more information

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
That's H-O-R-D-E-H-O-U-S-E

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
Up to 20 episodes this week

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
We hit 30

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
Nice you're old

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
Oh wait we're on 408 of this show

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
I know right

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
Quickly going to go to

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
The rapid fire news

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
And the tweets and all that stuff

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
I wanted to ask you

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
Speaking of Twitter and all that

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000
Some folks saw that you were doing a little bit of fundraising this week

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
By selling off some of your

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
Video game collection

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
Which I know is probably not an easy thing to do

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
But what was some of the stuff you sold this week

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
And how did it do?

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
My most coveted title

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
That I got rid of was

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
Magic Knight Rayearth

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
By Working Designs for the Sega Saturn

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
It was the last game put out in the US

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
Months after the Saturn was already

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
Dead and buried

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
They put this out

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
Even more rare I think than Panzer Dragoon Saga

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
I want to say

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
It's up there

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
Panzer Dragoon RPG

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
I don't know

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
The two of them are pretty much rivals

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
For hardest to find

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
So Rayearth was a top down

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
Basically it was a Legend of Zelda

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
A Link to the Past clone

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
As far as visually how it looked

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
The RPG

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
Anime cutscenes

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
The clamp anime

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
Beautiful show

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
They did such a good job with translating it

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
Especially since they don't talk every time you touch something

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
Like in a Japanese one

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
It saved so much memory

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
It was so much better

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
So that went for

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
I've seen it go for over $100

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
But I got about $80 for it

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
That's not too bad

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
I never played it

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
Never touched it

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
We've beaten it

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
Bust a Move

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
Not the puzzle bobble thing

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000
But it was released in the US as Bust a Groove

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
The soundtrack

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
I think in the JP

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
Edition was a lot better

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
Paper Mario 64

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
Ogre Battle 64

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
And a bunch of Saturn import stuff

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
Darkstalkers

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
X-Men vs Street Fighter

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
I'm going to have a round 2 of stuff

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
Going up next week

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
One of which will include

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
The PS2 edition of Rez

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
I'm getting rid of that

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
Because I have it at Rez HD on Xbox 360

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
And I think some DDR games

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
You're going to get rid of too right?

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
Yeah I'm selling my PS1

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
3rd Mix and Best Hits

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
Which I think came out after

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
4th and before 5th

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
Let me talk to you about Rez

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
Ok

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
So check that out, that'll be up soon

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
The reason I'm getting rid of these

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
Is because they're in great shape

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
I know I'm never going to play them again

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
But actually having them in my hand

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
I wanted to hook my Saturn up

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
To play some Vampire Savior

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
Even though if it wasn't for me selling them

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
I never would have had the Inkling

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
To ever touch the game again

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
Even though it's a great game

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
So it's just weird how you're attached to something

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
But you know you'd never play it

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
Unless you're confronted with getting rid of it

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
It's just weird how nostalgia works

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
That's kind of how our vault is

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
Except we sometimes do get the wild hair

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
To break out one of the systems and play it

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
I mean the whole reason we have

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
So many systems is because nothing quite

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
Mimics having the controller

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
In your hand

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
You can play Vampire Savior with us

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
I'll hook up the Saturn

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
Alright, well let's get to some rapid

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
Fire news before we get into

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
Doing the tweets tonight

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
Last call for tweets at twitter.com slash o-l-r

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
Meanwhile Loki hates to tear you

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
Away from whatever it is you're doing over there

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
That involves a lot of numbers

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
I don't think that's porn

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
But yeah we gotta do some rapid news

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
I'm crunching in numbers

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
Yeah there's some cool announcements

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
Chopped Lifter HD

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
It's a remake of the classic game

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
Supposed to be coming out on the Playstation

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
Network and PC this fall

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
And based on some of the screenshots

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
Here

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
Looks

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
A little

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
Much like the classic game just you know

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
With the 3D HD visuals

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
Kinda cool looking

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
I don't know, hopefully it turns out well

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
And then

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
Another remake also in the works

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
Warlords

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
The old Atari game is being remade

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
That one's coming to Xbox Live Arcade

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
And Playstation Network this summer

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
You probably can expect that as part of the

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
Summer of gaming or whatever the hell they call it

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
On the Xbox Live

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
They're saying that it's gonna also

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
I guess have the classic version

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
As well as an

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000
Evolved version

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
I guess which was found

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
Or they had the evolved version

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
Which was in a previous Xbox Live Arcade release

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
But this

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
I guess is gonna be

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
Something different

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
Never really played

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
The original Warlords game so

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
I don't know, looks neat

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
And then finally

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
Minecraft

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
Goes into beta 1.4

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
And they added

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
The wolves, cookies

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
And some other stuff

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
Yeah tameable wolves

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
Cookies, sleeping in a bed

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
Resets your spawn position

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
A new logo holding shift while

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
Climbing will hang onto the ladder

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
Spiders no longer

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
Trample crops and

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
Lots and lots of infrastructure

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
And statistical

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
achievements

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
Alright

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
Neat, let's

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
Have you played Minecraft yet?

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
No I have not either

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
I watched a funny video today though

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
Of some girl's Minecraft house

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
And she was just really funny

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
Oh my god there's like 400 pounds of bacon right here

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
And there were like pigs everywhere in front of her house

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
It was really funny

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
I haven't played Minecraft

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
But yet I've played SingStar

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
And SingStar is adding 40 new songs to the store

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
This week

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
Now you can sing along with such karaoke classics

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
As Cryin' by Aerosmith

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
Who Let the Dogs Out by The Baja Men

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
Crocodile Rock by Elton John

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
Let's see

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
I'm Good I'm Gone by Leaky Lee

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
Likey Lee?

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
I don't even know how to say her name

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
She's crazier than Bjork

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
I don't know how you would sing along to that

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000
But you can now

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
Grace Kelly by Mika

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
A bunch of songs by the band Razorlight

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
Oh, Just for Salacious Pop

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
I know you love the Pussycat Dolls

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
So you can do Hush Hush now

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
On SingStar

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000
Also some dance add-ons have been sold as well

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000
And then most interesting in a way

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
Classical song packs

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
I'm not sure how exactly you sing

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
I guess maybe it's old opera style

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
I don't know but you can do

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
O Sole Mio by Di Capua

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
Mozart with Queen of the Night Aria

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
La Donna y Mobile

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
by Verdi

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
I don't know why but yeah

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
now classic songs are available

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
I know classical singers

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
That's a series that's like Boohoo Crazy in Europe

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
Yeah, it's pretty big over there

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
There are okay games here

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
They had the SingStar Queen

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
and the SingStar Abba

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
Probably the biggest thing about this is that

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
the actual music videos, if available, play

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
behind the song when you're singing it

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
So that's pretty cool

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
Can't wait to see the music video for the Mozart stuff

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000
I know, I'm kind of wondering how that's gonna work

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
I have some generic video in the background there

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
I don't know

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000
Well, some more information following unfortunately

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
the tragedy in Japan

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000
It has some folks asking a little bit forward

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000
What's gonna happen to Tokyo Game Show 2011?

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000
Well, now there's no plans to

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000
cancel the Tokyo Game Show just yet

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
But they are saying it could happen in a reduced state

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000
This was in an interview

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000
that the Tokyo Game Show officials did with Kotaku

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000
They didn't say anything yet

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
But they did say

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000
Depending on the situation from here on out

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000
It's possible that the show

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000
is reduced

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
The show is scheduled to take place in September

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
I'm sure it'll still be a

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
pretty big thing and they haven't said

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
it's closed off to the public or any of that yet

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
But they are treading a little bit

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
carefully with a lot of uncertainty

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000
still happening in the world

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000
after the really unfortunate

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
earthquake and subsequent

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000
tsunami and subsequent issues with the reactor

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
and all that stuff

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
Hopefully they're able to get all that sorted out

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
in the 2021 show in September

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
Speaking of the tragedy in Japan

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
A real favorite here of

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000
Orange Lounge Radio is spearing up a new

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
effort to raise money

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000
Akira Yamaoka, who of course was

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000
one of the minds behind Silent Hill

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000
and so forth, he is doing a benefit

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000
album for tsunami survivors

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000
It's called Play for Japan

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000
Kind of a play on words of the

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
Pray for Japan Twitter hashtag that was going on at the time

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000
It's gonna be a benefit album

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000
and it's gonna have some of these

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000
participants will be involved

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000
Akira Yamaoka, Nobuo Uematsu

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000
who did of course Final Fantasy and a lot of those

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000
Yasunori Mitsuda, Chrono Trigger

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000
hello, need I say more

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000
Bear McCreery, if you don't recognize that

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
Battlestar Galactica

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000
and which, god that had a great

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000
soundtrack that show

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000
and Woody Jackson who did Red Dead Redemption

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000
so some western influence

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000
as well as from Japan

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000
so that's pretty awesome

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000
Akira Yamaoka also posted a letter at

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000
playforjapan.org

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
available in several languages

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000
so that's pretty cool, it's supposed to come out in May 2011

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000
on iTunes

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000
so you don't even have to leave the house to do your

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000
little bit to help support

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000
the Japanese relief, I think that's a great idea

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000
Alright, let's move on

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000
Dr. Sakura

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000
Well, we have some

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000
Street Fighter news actually coming out of

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000
the UK

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000
there was

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
registered for the BBFC

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000
Super Street Fighter 4 Arcade Edition

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000
to be coming out in June

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000
that's the British Board of Film Classification

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000
which also is in charge of

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
video games for some reason

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
why can't they do that here?

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000
anyway

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
Capcom hasn't

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000
necessarily confirmed

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000
but they're putting out that there's

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000
that it could be

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000
download content

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000
or you can buy an expansion, they're still

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000
speculating

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000
also in other news

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000
Music Unlimited, the platform is coming

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000
to PSP, NGP

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000
and Xperia Play

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000
this was actually stated

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000
by the CEO of Sony Network

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000
Entertainment, Sean Layden

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000
saying that it's going to be coming

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000
to the PSP in a matter of weeks

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000
so that will be later on this year

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000
and

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000
this is

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
as far as I can tell

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000
I think this is a music sharing

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000
program

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000
from what it looks like

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000
but like a legal way of doing it

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
instead of like you know

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000
LimeWire or whatever the kids use these days

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000
BitTorrent I guess

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000
and then in Rock Band 3

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000
news we have Joy Division download content

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000
which I like Joy Division

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000
but not just them, we have Grand Funk Railroad

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000
the Locomotion and we're an American band

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000
and J Gal's band Freeze Frame

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000
and Joy Division Love Will Tear Us Apart

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000
That's it

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000
Alright, let's go to the Twitter

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000
but first I want to read a comment here from our chatroom

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000
at chat.orangelandtrady.com

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000
Kossin in our chatroom says

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000
I do not want the MPAA

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000
in charge of video game ratings

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000
those guys are idiots

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000
yeah actually that's a really good point, those guys are idiots

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000
you know the way they rate some of those movies

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000
is unbelievable

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000
I like the idea of a unified system

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000
between movies and

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
video games but don't fucking put the MPAA

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000
in charge of that, dismantle the MPAA

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
and put a new board in charge

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000
that would be a wonderful idea

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000
so a good point from that person in our chatroom

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000
Let's go to the Twitter

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
twitter.com

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000
slash o-l-r is where you can send us

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
tweets every week

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000
we read your tweets here on the show and we'll respond to them

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
Fun ET Man sent us a tweet

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000
saying I wonder if you will talk about this

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000
and sent us to an article on

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000
thelostlevels.org

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000
this is a website that likes to kind of find

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
old prototypes and things that have

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000
changed in games, they've done some

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
stories on Zelda or whatever

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000
well this article happens to be on the game

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000
Bio Force Ape

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000
and I guess this is a game that was kind of recently

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000
finally dumped into a ROM

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000
here's the deal, this game never actually

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000
came out, it was teased in

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000
Nintendo Power in the early 90's

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000
it was an NES game and in this game

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000
you take control of Bio Force Ape

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000
a genetically altered super chimpanzee

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000
as he tries to make his way through a high-tech

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000
maze to rescue his adopted human family

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000
what? yeah right?

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000
apparently one of the best parts of the game

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000
is when Bio Force Ape takes a wild out of

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.000
control ride on one of the speeding platforms

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000
or coal cars

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000
animation is humorous and so on and so on

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
and yeah so I guess there was

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
this whole debacle, somebody had

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000
the game, it came out in

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000
2005 that the game was out

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000
there and that there was photographic evidence

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000
taken and I guess

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000
you know obviously the thing was

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
it had bugs in it and so forth

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000
the guy was urged to

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.000
sell the prototype but he was

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000
really scared about the ROM getting out there

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000
more

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000
stuff came out including this

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
humorous punching of a slime

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000
it's like a monkey made out of

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000
butter, what is that? I don't even know what that is

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000
but then apparently he smashed the

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000
cartridge, he said screw you guys

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000
I'm going home and smashed the cartridge

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000
well apparently the real deal was finally

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000
sold and

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000
dumped and there's actually a whole little

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000
thing available on YouTube

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000
where you can actually kind of see some of this game in progress

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000
it's fast moving for an NES game at the

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000
time, it looks like it has blast processing

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000
it looks like it is made by Sega

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000
no it's not Sega, it's close

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000
it's uh, SETA

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000
SETA made the game

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
it looks like a Ninja Gaiden ROM hack

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000
or something, a little bit doesn't it

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000
it's very fast moving

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000
see there's a little minecart

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.000
it looks kind of cool

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000
go monkey go, go monkey go

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000
alright

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000
let's see moving on to some more

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
tweets here

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000
SSA100Matt sent us a tweet saying

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.000
our old pal YYR has released

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000
a press kit for Snake

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000
361, it's the sequel

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000
to Snake 360

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000
Snake 361 is supposed to be coming out for

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000
the holidays this year

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.000
and let's see what is some new stuff

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000
teleporters and traps

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000
so now you get teleporters in the game

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000
of course Snake 360 had the

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.000
four player battles, it was very

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000
multiplayer, they really should let this

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000
they really should just let him put it out on Xbox Live

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000
it would be really cool if you could actually play it

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000
through the interwebs, but right now

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000
it's more of a local multiplayer game

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000
and I think he had YouTubes of people playing the game

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000
and having fun, battle mode

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000
will, I mean those teleporters are going to drive you

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000
bonkers in battle mode, so that'll be fun

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000
and there's some 1080p screenshots

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000
available now and some music

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000
is all there, so all the information is

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000
available at snake360.com

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000
Spazinator

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000
tweets us a story, it's a Sony

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.000
story here, let me see what this is all about

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000
I've got to load this, it's not loading

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000
God dammit he's trying to rickroll us

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000
you little bastard, I cut it off

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000
before he could, was that real?

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000
yeah it started coming, it said Rick Astley

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000
nope, nope, done with that

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000
so congratulations Spazinator

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000
you have banned yourself from

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000
Twitter for one whole month, we will not be reading

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000
your tweets for one whole month

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000
that's what's going to happen to people that try to

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000
rickroll us, you are banned from Twitter for a month

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000
congratulations, alright

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
let's move on to Tiger Claw

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
sends us a couple links here, one of them

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000
is about Burnout Crash

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000
Burnout Crash is coming to the

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000
Xbox 360 and the Playstation 3

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000
I guess EA hasn't

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000
announced a new Burnout game

01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.000
but Australia actually released

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000
a classification for

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000
Burnout Crash

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000
and I guess surfing some LinkedIn profiles

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000
has found out that this is happening

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000
it's an Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 title

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000
no official announcement yet

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000
seems logical there would be another Burnout game

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.000
at some point, hopefully it's a little more like

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000
the older games, I know the Burnout Paradise

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000
or whatever was really well supported

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000
but that franchise

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000
still sells really well, right?

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000
as far as I know, yeah

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000
Paradise was awesome

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000
alright, I mean

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
come on, you gotta love, it's like

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000
oh, any moment I want to go in the crash mode, ok

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000
crash mode, it was awesome

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000
alright, and

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000
moving on, let's see, Tiger Claw

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.000
sends us one more link here, I'll read

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000
the other one he sent us

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000
is coming up later, let's see

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000
Americans average 13 minutes

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000
playing video games on TV

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000
daily

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000
only 13 minutes?

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000
I think that's the people who play for 4 hours at a time

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000
balancing out those that don't play at all

01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000
I don't know how that works, but yeah

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.000
adults spend an average of 13 minutes

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000
a day using a TV to play video games

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.000
that's from Nielsen's state of the media

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000
US TV trends

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000
by ethnicity

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000
I guess, because now it breaks it all down

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000
by ethnic as well

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000
African Americans spend slightly more time

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000
playing video games on TV averaging

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000
16 minutes a day across the population

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000
Hispanics spend an average of 10 minutes a day

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000
you know, they're all

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000
less than 20 minutes

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000
which most people I know that play video games spend

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000
hours and hours, so

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000
this is just this weird law of averages thing

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000
coming into play

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000
Nielsen got paid probably millions of dollars to do that study

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000
that really didn't tell me anything

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000
ironically enough though, you have to admit this is a little bit ironic

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000
according to their little graph here

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000
the smallest ethnicity

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000
or I should say the smallest playtime

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
by any ethnicity, 9 minutes

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000
Asians, who knew?

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000
there you go

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000
because they have

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000
the tiger mom

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000
I guess, I don't know

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
let's move on

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000
something a little less racial please

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000
a little less racial?

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000
alright, fine

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000
so we're gonna talk a little bit about

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000
the 3DS, obviously

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000
3DS probably did pretty well

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000
I'd assume

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000
Nintendo's saying it's the best first day

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000
handheld sales

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000
launch ever

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000
so

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000
there's no real numbers yet

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000
but they're saying they did pretty well

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000
and I guess the numbers will be made public on April 14th

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000
when the NPD numbers actually

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000
come out

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000
so it'll be interesting to see how well they did

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000
I'm assuming they sold everything

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000
or at least pretty close to everything within the last

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000
probably week it came out

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000
so

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000
good for them, I suppose

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000
unfortunately though

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000
it wasn't without problems

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000
there are some issues with the 3DS

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
including some crashes

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000
apparently people have been running into

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
some software crashes

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000
that require the system

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000
to be shut off and then turned back on

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000
to get it playing right

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000
apparently this was fixed in

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000
the latest firmware

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000
the one you download to get your little 3D video

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000
from OKGO

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000
so that's kind of cool

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000
at least that's been fixed

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000
however something that's not really gonna be able to be fixed

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000
some sort of patching system

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000
is the fact that the hinges once again

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000
are loose or at least some people are

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000
reporting loose hinges which require

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000
you to actually send your system back in to get it repaired

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.000
what a slut that 3DS

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000
must be, totally loose I heard

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000
I haven't had that problem with the loose hinge

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000
yet, but I know it was something that

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
plagued a lot of systems before

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000
especially on the DS Lite

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000
kind of sucks

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000
but thankfully

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000
not a problem for me

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000
well hopefully they'll fix a lot of these

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000
hardware problems in the 3DS Lite

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000
which will come out next year inevitably

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000
or the 3DS XL

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000
or the 3DS I

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000
or the 3DS bigger peen

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000
whatever they're gonna call it that comes out next year

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
yeah, so

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000
you can bet on that, and then colors of course

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000
there'll be colors

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000
alright, moving on

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000
lawsuit!

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000
somebody is suing EA

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000
there might be some weight to this one though

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000
if you're in law suits or somebody mad about something a little frivolous

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000
this could have some actual weight to it

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000
you know the game John Madden

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000
Football? Well you ought to because

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000
this is the series that became Madden

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000
NFL like what, oh

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.000
7, oh 8, oh 9, 11, 10

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.000
an annual sequel for like 20 years or something

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.000
yeah, every year there's a damn Madden game

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000
well it started as a game called John Madden Football

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000
and it was originally what?

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000
it was on the Commodore 64

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.000
the Apple II, it was on DOS systems

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000
all the way back in 1988

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000
it was the first John Madden Football

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000
and you can kind of tell because like in this little like

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000
horrible pixelated screenshot

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000
that was the extent of the Commodore 64 graphics

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000
back in the day, like look how pixelated he is

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000
and also his hair is not totally

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.000
grey, I mean clearly that's toupee

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000
but it's not like totally freaking grey

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000
so you know this is a long

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000
old game, well my point with

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000
this here is that Robin

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.000
Antonick who created the very

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000
first game, and you see his name there in the programming

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.000
there, in Madden

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000
apparently

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000
23 years after this very first game

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:13.000
he is not seeing

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.000
any revenue from it

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.000
now he has filed suit against

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000
Electronic Arts for tens of millions in royalties

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.000
and apparently

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.000
he was responsible for the development of

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000
virtually all the groundbreaking technology

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.000
at the heart of the game, that's at least

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000
what he claims in his suit

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000
EA has not paid this guy

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000
any royalties since

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.000
1992

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.000
was the last time he got royalties

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.000
interesting, I mean

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.000
he did make the original game, it was

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000
kinda his baby, I mean I'm

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.000
sure the game has changed many times since

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:47.000
then, something you may not know, John

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.000
Madden football did not have actual NFL

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000
teams, they didn't have the NFL license at the time

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000
EA got that years later

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000
so you know you could say

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000
the game's changed a whole fuck ton since

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000
the beginning, so maybe this guy doesn't deserve

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000
anything, well yeah I mean it's

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000
John Madden's namesake

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:05.000
that's the brand, you know

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.000
the actual announcer guy

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.000
but this person

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.000
Robin

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.000
sounds like he might have signed a bad contract

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.000
when they took the license from

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.000
him where he was paid up front for the

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.000
concept

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:21.000
of what it is, but I'd have to read more

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:23.000
about what the actual

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.000
the complaint that was filed in court

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.000
I would need to read that to know

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000
how reasonable this is

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:31.000
yeah, but

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:33.000
it's gonna be interesting, I mean especially

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.000
with such a huge franchise to see

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000
kinda what happens with this, but you know

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:39.000
a lot of times, especially back in the day

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:41.000
I mean back in the 80's, you know this was

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:43.000
always a huge thing where programmers

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.000
really weren't getting the credit they deserved

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.000
I mean that was why Activision was kinda

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.000
formed in the first place, it was a bunch of

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.000
people really upset that programmers didn't

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.000
get more credit in Atari games

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.000
the very first Easter egg

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:57.000
in a video game was where

01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:59.000
the dude's initials were in Adventure

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.000
that was so that the guy could kinda sneak

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000
his credit in there, because Atari never

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.000
credited their programmers and game designers

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.000
but Activision, remember the names like

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.000
David Crane and so forth, these guys would make the games

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000
and get to put their names on them, because a lot of

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:13.000
these Atari games were by like one guy

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:15.000
or two guys

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:17.000
and they're cool guys

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:19.000
ET, worst Atari 2600

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:21.000
game of all time, according to some people

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:23.000
was done by a guy called Howard Scott Warshaw

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:25.000
you know why else he's famous?

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:27.000
He also made Yara's Revenge, made one of the best games

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000
he's one of the worst games, go figure

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000
you should read about how he was

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.000
under all that pressure to make ET, it really makes

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.000
a lot of sense as to why that game didn't come out so well

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:37.000
Pac-Man was

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.000
one guy too that wanted

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.000
to put it on a bigger cartridge, but Atari wouldn't let him

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000
because it would cost too much, that's why it sucked

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.000
so

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.000
that's so bad, it's like the worst port ever

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.000
but it's so funny because you play the old school

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:51.000
Pac-Man on the 2600 and it really

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:53.000
is garbage, but then they had a Miss Pac-Man

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.000
later, it was great

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:57.000
for an Atari game, it was great

01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:59.000
well the reason why is because the

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.000
Miss Pac-Man was on like a 4K cart

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.000
whereas the Pac-Man was on like half that

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.000
maybe a quarter of that, I don't know

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:07.000
so like, the whole drawing one

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:09.000
ghost every frame, why the ghost

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:11.000
flickered so terribly, that was a restriction

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:13.000
of the cartridge, I mean think about it

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:15.000
those programmers had 2K

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.000
to design an entire

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000
game, 2K

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:21.000
is how long an SA is, you know, it's

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:23.000
crazy

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:25.000
anyhow

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.000
boy, we

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:29.000
should get into classic gaming discussion a lot on this

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.000
show, it's pretty good, alright, it's cause we love it

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.000
we do, uh, and we're old

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.000
um, Dark

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.000
Sakura, Wii, what do you mean

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.000
Wii, I'm sorry, especially Dark

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.000
Sakura, hey, don't make me break

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:43.000
out the vuvuzela

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.000
how about I break out another new story

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:47.000
well, Monolith

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000
Soft's putting out the Wii

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.000
RPG Xenoblade, and it's being

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:53.000
localized, for

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:55.000
Europe, yay

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:57.000
um,

01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:59.000
it's actually going up for

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:01.000
Xenoblade Chronicles, that

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.000
um, although the trailer itself is

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:05.000
untranslated

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.000
it shows basically all of the imagery

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:09.000
going out, um, Nintendo

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.000
of Europe put out a press release

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:13.000
and then removed it

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:15.000
um, but somebody

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.000
actually managed to get it out and get the information

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.000
out, and it's supposed to, uh, have

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:21.000
English and Japanese voice action

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:23.000
uh, voice, uh, options

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.000
so

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:27.000
maybe we'll get it

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:29.000
here too? I'm assuming if they're gonna

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:31.000
spend the time to translate into English that they're

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:33.000
gonna release it in not

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:35.000
more than one region, I mean, they gotta

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:37.000
what if there's like an elevator in the game

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:39.000
and they call it a lift? Americans

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:41.000
might not understand, oh my god, where will they

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:43.000
find that one employee to type

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:45.000
elevator?

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:47.000
Woo, that was a day's work, there

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:49.000
what if somebody in the

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:51.000
game, maybe there's a smoking scene and the guy

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:53.000
says he's gonna go out and have a fag

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:55.000
and that could never go over here in the

01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:57.000
US, because like, you know, Glatt will sue

01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:59.000
once again, you know, that same employee

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:01.000
on day two could easily type

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:03.000
cigarette

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:05.000
this looks pretty good though, or maybe they're gonna

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.000
go out and have a crumpet and people will be like

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:09.000
they don't know what the fuck that is over in the United

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000
States, pants versus trousers, people

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.000
will just burst into tears, exactly

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:15.000
my favorite one is the word fanny

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:17.000
it's not just a pack anymore

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:19.000
no, fanny

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:21.000
here is your butt, there, the vag

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:23.000
oh my, is that why

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:25.000
a fanny pack is really in the front?

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:27.000
a friend of mine explained that

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:29.000
to me, of course, well, you know why I always

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:31.000
giggle when I pass the catering place, because

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.000
it's called Randy Peters?

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:35.000
because Randy is like horny

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.000
oh, I get it, oh

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.000
you're a nerd, alright

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.000
I wanna get to

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.000
some old comments from our chat room, it was on

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:45.000
the last story, but my bad, we

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:47.000
didn't get around to this here

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:49.000
let's see, GameGuru

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:51.000
in response to the whole Madden lawsuit

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:53.000
thing said, all EA has to do is prove

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:55.000
that his code was not used after 1992

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:57.000
or that the contract

01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:59.000
with them was only valid until 1992

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:01.000
Spazernator

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:03.000
says, yet Activision no longer gives

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:05.000
credits and manuals anymore, oh the irony

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:07.000
and DarkToaGak follows that up

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:09.000
with what the fuck is a game manual

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:11.000
I thought they did have

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.000
credits and game manuals, they're just like all the way in the back

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:15.000
they do, and then EA

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:17.000
EA doesn't have manuals anymore

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:19.000
from what I remember, really, they're all

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.000
digital, it's all online now, digital manuals

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.000
it's all on the disc, I think you just have to make

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.000
the information available

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000
this game looks super pretty by the way

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:29.000
oh, the Xenoblade, yeah, yeah it looks

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.000
pretty cool, it doesn't look like a Wii game

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:33.000
that's for sure, alright

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:35.000
just a couple more stories before we get to the mailbag

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:37.000
mailbag.orangelaungeradio.com is where

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:39.000
we invite you guys to email us every week

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:41.000
we talked a little bit about how there was a

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:43.000
PlayStation 1 emulator for Android

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:45.000
and how, you know, that may

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:47.000
interfere with the PlayStation phone

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.000
since, you know, anybody could just download ROMs

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:51.000
and play them on there

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:53.000
yeah, except that, you know, Sony decided

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:55.000
hey, you know what, we got this PlayStation

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:57.000
phone coming out, so

01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:59.000
ahhhh, let's get it removed

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.000
so PSX4Droid

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:03.000
was removed from the Android marketplace

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:05.000
without warning due to

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.000
a content policy violation

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:09.000
um, he's

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:11.000
I guess, are, you know, saying

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:13.000
what the hell, he's expecting, he

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:15.000
figured it was from the, you know,

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:17.000
Xperia Play coming out, but also

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:19.000
that it's a little weird seeing as

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:21.000
there's other, um

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:23.000
another emulator already

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:25.000
on there, FPSC

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:27.000
that's still on the marketplace

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:29.000
so he's like, what the hell

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:31.000
um, and he couldn't be more right

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:33.000
that that was pretty much the reason

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:35.000
why they removed it, because the day after

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:37.000
it was removed, PlayStation 1

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:39.000
games started appearing on the Android marketplace

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:41.000
and of course, they were limited to the

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:43.000
Xperia Play

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:45.000
and the initial offerings, of course, were

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:47.000
Cool Borders 2, Destruction

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:49.000
Derby, Jumping Flash

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:51.000
Medieval 2, and Siphon Filter

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:53.000
and, uh,

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:55.000
all those are available for

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:57.000
$6 or $3.99

01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:59.000
and, uh, I guess it's the same

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:01.000
price that they're going on the

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:03.000
PlayStation ork right now

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:05.000
um,

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:07.000
it is kind of, uh, funny that I

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:09.000
guess they're saying that, um

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:11.000
I don't

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:13.000
know, I would think

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:17.000
I thought the marketplace for Android was

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:19.000
open, I mean, if you can't get your app

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:21.000
on the Android marketplace, I mean, there's other

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:23.000
marketplaces out there where you can

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:25.000
I don't know

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:27.000
upload it somewhere else and someone can download it from

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:29.000
that website, am I correct, I think?

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:31.000
Because I know they have the Amazon marketplace

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:33.000
now, and obviously that's not on the Android

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:35.000
marketplace

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:37.000
I don't know, iPhone's

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:39.000
all different. They're all, oh yeah, everyone in here

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:41.000
is an iPhone already. Yeah, I know, so sorry

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:43.000
don't mean to be ignorant, but it's how it is

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:45.000
Well, I mean, that sucks

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:47.000
I guess, but, you know, it makes sense because

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:49.000
obviously, you know, if there's a free PlayStation

01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:51.000
or even a PlayStation emulator

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:53.000
that you can buy and then download the ROMs

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:55.000
for, that would kind of defeat

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:57.000
the point of having to buy

01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:59.000
you know, all

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:01.000
these different games

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:03.000
and, you know, if it is anything

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:05.000
like a normal Android phone

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:07.000
people really want to, since it is

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:09.000
legal to jailbreak your phone

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:11.000
you could jailbreak or root your phone

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:13.000
and download this anyways

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:15.000
and... But really, why play a PlayStation

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:17.000
game on your phone?

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:19.000
Well, why buy a phone that's meant

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:21.000
for playing PlayStation games

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:23.000
if you're not going to play PlayStation games

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:25.000
better yet, why buy a phone

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:27.000
to play PlayStation games? I'm not sure

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.000
I don't know, I guess it's really not that different

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:31.000
than the PSP when all is said and done, but I don't know

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:33.000
I know, but... I guess that

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:35.000
when I think playing games on my phone

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:37.000
I think that the horrible

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:39.000
horrible touchscreen

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:41.000
controls on the iPod

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:43.000
iPhone, that only very few

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:45.000
games get right, like, I hate

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:47.000
the whole, like, static button

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:49.000
like, trying to put a layer of button thing

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:51.000
on the screen, expect that to work, because it doesn't

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:53.000
like, games like Mega Man 2 and stuff are just fucking

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:55.000
terrible, you know, and I think of like

02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:57.000
how the fuck are you supposed to play a PlayStation game

02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:59.000
with that type of setup, but then I forget

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:01.000
oh yeah, these Xperia plays and stuff, they actually have buttons

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:03.000
they're meant, they're like PSPs

02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:05.000
but they actually work as phones, so that makes a lot more

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:07.000
sense to me. But

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:09.000
I don't know, I mean, it's not like this thing

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:11.000
plays PSP games

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:13.000
it plays PlayStation 1 games, I mean

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:15.000
really, who's really... Your PSP

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:17.000
will play PlayStation 1 games too. Exactly, I mean

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:19.000
if you really want something to play

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:21.000
PlayStation 1 games on, seriously

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:23.000
go find a generation 1

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:25.000
PSP, oh my god

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:27.000
that would probably be pretty dirt cheap

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:29.000
or go to a

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:31.000
farmer's market

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:33.000
auction thing that has the, you know

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:35.000
I'm thinking like, Denio is here locally, but

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:37.000
PlayStation's everywhere

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:39.000
there are PSPs everywhere, and if you

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:41.000
really... Even the actual PlayStation 1s

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:43.000
I wouldn't, yeah

02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:45.000
yeah, PlayStation 1s, but I mean

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:47.000
on the go, I mean PlayStation 1's not very

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:49.000
you know, portable

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:51.000
I mean, you could technically do it

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:53.000
with a battery pack and stuff, but it's

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:55.000
I seem to remember some little screen

02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:57.000
they have the screen, no, they do have

02:01:57.000 --> 02:01:59.000
the screen, and they're used for hacking

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:01.000
stuff quite a bit, they're definitely

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:03.000
used for portable consoles

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:05.000
more than the actual, you know

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:07.000
PlayStation 1, but I mean seriously

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:09.000
you just buy a PSP and just play your

02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:11.000
PlayStation 1 games on there if you really want to do it

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:13.000
and that way you don't get locked into a contract and you don't

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:15.000
need to buy this expensive phone for it

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:17.000
but I mean, people like gaming on the

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:19.000
phone, and here's my

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:21.000
thing, it's like, you know, it's good

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:23.000
that they have these buttons, but are all

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:25.000
the developers really using it? No, they

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:27.000
are not, so, you know, don't expect

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:29.000
to buy this and go all of a sudden, oh hey, now I can

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:31.000
play Mega Man 2 or something like that

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:33.000
really easily

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:35.000
using the buttons, because you're

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:37.000
not going to be able to

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:39.000
I don't know, it's

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:41.000
whatever, I mean

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:43.000
if you want to do this, this is something for you

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:45.000
just, you know, know it's out there now

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:47.000
Misty in our chatroom says, speaking of

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:49.000
iPhones, someone needs to get theirs away from a mic

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:51.000
Jamie

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:53.000
I'm dealing something with Dan

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:55.000
oh, well still, it's

02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:57.000
I moved it, look, it's over here

02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:59.000
and you know, whenever

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:01.000
anybody hears that doo doo doo tone

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:03.000
like everybody looks at their, any iPhone owner

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:05.000
whenever that, there's some commercial on the radio

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:07.000
that uses that tone and it's terrible

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:09.000
I don't do that because my volume on my

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:11.000
iPod is turned off, and also

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:13.000
my iPod is turned off

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:15.000
like a normal person would

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:17.000
iPhone people

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:19.000
crazy

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:21.000
well, maybe my mommy needs to contact me

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:23.000
in an emergency

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:25.000
my husband's two states away, so

02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:27.000
I'm trying to keep in touch with him

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:29.000
no, I understand that, that's no problem, but I'm just saying, you know

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:33.000
yeah, I don't know what you're saying, alright

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:37.000
alright, let's move on to another story about

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:39.000
Ultima, I mentioned earlier in the show

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:41.000
Ultima Online randomly got brought up

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:43.000
well, there are some rumors going around

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:45.000
that Ultima could quite possibly be coming back

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:47.000
but I don't know, this is stretching a little bit guys

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:49.000
here's the deal, Ultima 4

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:51.000
has been available online

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:53.000
through these various websites

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:55.000
Abandonware or Flash

02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:57.000
emulators and so forth, GOG maybe

02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:59.000
yeah, well no, not even GOG, I'm talking like

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:01.000
illegal means to play

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:03.000
Ultima 4, but you know how like a lot of that

02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:05.000
Abandonware, the whole theory behind it is

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:07.000
well, after so many, even though it's like total

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:09.000
BS, after so many years you lose the right

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:11.000
no, companies don't ever lose the rights to them

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:13.000
it's just that they just bank on

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:15.000
people are going to stop caring after

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:17.000
7 or 8 years or whatever the Abandonware sites say

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:19.000
well, I guess these sites were hosting

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:21.000
Ultima 4, and sites have been

02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:23.000
giving away that game

02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:25.000
since like the late 90's

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:27.000
this game dates all the way back to 1985

02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:29.000
there was a version of it on the NES

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:31.000
and that was one of the later releases

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:33.000
Ultima 4 is an old ass game

02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:35.000
well, apparently what happened

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:37.000
is that some of these sites that were hosting the game

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:39.000
EA had them take

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:41.000
down, there was like some

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:43.000
cease and desist that went out there

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:45.000
now, some people are thinking

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:47.000
it's tied into this whole

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:49.000
thing that Paul Barnett

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:51.000
who is a creative director

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:53.000
at BioWare and Mythic, he's a very

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:55.000
RPG centered guy, he's been talking about a

02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:57.000
secret project which includes

02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:59.000
an all new MMO from EA

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:01.000
so could it be that

02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:03.000
EA is trying to protect this old IP

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:05.000
all of a sudden because

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:07.000
they're about to announce a new Ultima MMO

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:09.000
at E3, who knows

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:11.000
so of course

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:13.000
as brought up earlier in the show, Ultima Online

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:15.000
has been out since 1997

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:17.000
so it is a 14 year old game

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:19.000
so maybe it's going to get an update

02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:21.000
and that could also explain this whole loyalty program thing

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:23.000
coming out of the blue it seems like

02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:25.000
maybe like a last hurrah for Ultima Online

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:27.000
before they're about to announce something big

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:29.000
at E3, who knows

02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:31.000
and the last time that we heard something

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:33.000
about this happening

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:35.000
was the Sarian games

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:37.000
that had all the Space Quest and King's Quest

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:39.000
for Sierra Online available to play

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:41.000
and then the

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:43.000
the fandom game

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:45.000
I'm blanking on the name

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:47.000
Silver Lining, they got a C&D

02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:49.000
and we thought oh it's just you know

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:51.000
Activision being horrible

02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:53.000
but no the Telltale

02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:55.000
Telltale got the King's Quest

02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:57.000
revamp license

02:05:57.000 --> 02:05:59.000
and it's like oh well maybe they weren't just being

02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:01.000
total assholes, there's actually a relevant reason

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:03.000
for them to do those C&Ds

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:05.000
because that happened just one or two months ago

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:07.000
that gives me reason to believe

02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:09.000
this Ultima story can hold water

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:11.000
very good point

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:13.000
well we'll see what happens, I think E3 will be very telling

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:15.000
this could be one of the big things they announce

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:17.000
would there be interest in Ultima?

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:19.000
Ultima was, that was a big Richard Garriott thing too

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:21.000
remember that was like his baby

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:25.000
I didn't actually own my own gaming PC

02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:27.000
or a PC period until like

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:29.000
95, 96

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:31.000
so all the Ultima stuff that came before

02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:33.000
I personally missed out on all of the Ultima stuff

02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:35.000
during the 80s

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:37.000
see I owned 3 and 4 on the NES

02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:39.000
I owned both of them on the NES

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:41.000
and they were great games

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:43.000
well they were really hardcore

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:45.000
they were not like Final Fantasy

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:47.000
they were pretty in depth

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:49.000
I think 3 had an amazing soundtrack too

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:51.000
weren't they off a model of Dungeons and Dragons?

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:53.000
Ultima Exodus

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:55.000
was 3

02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:57.000
yeah because I tried playing that one

02:06:57.000 --> 02:06:59.000
I had it on Ness

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:01.000
like the Cleric or the Druid

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:03.000
there was like a million classes in it

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:05.000
yeah that was Ultima and then there was Ultima Quest of the Avatar

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:07.000
which was a little more

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:09.000
but see those games are really not like their PC counterparts

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:11.000
they were really

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:13.000
I don't want to say dumbed down but they were really changed

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:15.000
for the NES

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:17.000
mine ended up under a lawn mower

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:19.000
not my fault

02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:21.000
poor game

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:23.000
I found it in my front yard after

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:25.000
trying to find it and it was under a lawn mower

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:27.000
there was Ultima 5

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:29.000
on the NES as well

02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:31.000
and I think Ultima 7 I played on the PC

02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:33.000
that was Pagan right?

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:35.000
there was one big one that

02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:37.000
7, 8 or 9 I don't know had a lot of hype

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:39.000
to it

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:41.000
well they all had some hype to them

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:43.000
but now Richard Garriott is long gone

02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:45.000
he's not dead or anything

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:47.000
but he went off and did Tabula Rasa

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:49.000
which tanked unfortunately for him

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:51.000
that was the whole space MMO

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:53.000
it was not free

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:55.000
it was an NCSoft pay game

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:57.000
I played it once

02:07:57.000 --> 02:07:59.000
it was alright but it was more like a shooter type game

02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:01.000
and yeah that didn't go over so well

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:03.000
well maybe after that whole debacle

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:05.000
failed maybe he's coming back and doing this

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:07.000
who knows?

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:09.000
could be a variety of things

02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:11.000
alright let's get to the mailbag

02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:13.000
every week we invite your emails at

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:15.000
mailbag.orangelaungeradio.com

02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:17.000
and our soccer is going to dive into the email bag head first

02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:19.000
and pull out a couple emails that she thinks are worth

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:21.000
sharing with us tonight

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:23.000
I found some sticky ones

02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:25.000
first email

02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:27.000
last week you mentioned Sony changing over divisions

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:29.000
for their network services

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:31.000
I oddly got an email regarding this change

02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:33.000
but the contents of the email smelled of a phishing scam

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:35.000
the sender appears to be from

02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:37.000
playstation underscore network

02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:39.000
at playstation dot

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:41.000
enovix dot net

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:43.000
I haven't followed the links in the email

02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:45.000
which simply mentions the change

02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:47.000
the need to enter into new terms of service

02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:49.000
and the link where my Sony online services settings

02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:51.000
can be updated

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:53.000
the change has been confirmed as being legitimate

02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:55.000
am I simply being paranoid about this email

02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:57.000
Robert M

02:08:57.000 --> 02:08:59.000
no I think you have a right to question those types of emails

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:01.000
exactly and also I don't think

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:03.000
that they are actually having you agree to those terms

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:05.000
of services through

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:07.000
through that I got an email

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:09.000
I think I just ignored it

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:11.000
because I did get an email but the

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:13.000
minute I went back into the PS3 I played PS3

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:15.000
just a couple days ago I think after the first

02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:17.000
because this is when we were playing Mortal Combat

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:19.000
it was Friday right? and it made me

02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:21.000
accept the terms of service when I signed in

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:23.000
so that will all happen through your

02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:25.000
playstation so don't do anything with

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:27.000
email I was watching Supernatural on

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:29.000
Friday night and it didn't have

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:31.000
me do anything

02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:33.000
maybe you weren't connecting

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:35.000
to the interwebs idk

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:37.000
might be

02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:39.000
ok next email

02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:41.000
note

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:43.000
the following letter has been mirrored posted to the

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:45.000
Sims 3 online forums

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:47.000
and this is also titled by the way

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:49.000
empirical response to the Dragon Age 2 protest letter

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:51.000
dear sirs

02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:53.000
in the past week I've been playing a lot of the game

02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:55.000
The Sims 3 on my iPad

02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:57.000
I like most of the game however there is one element of the game

02:09:57.000 --> 02:09:59.000
that absolutely offends me

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:01.000
in the game you can make different meals for yourself

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:03.000
and whoever you happen to be living with

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:05.000
at the point in the game

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:07.000
among the meal options you can choose from

02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:09.000
is vegetable soup

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:11.000
this option deeply offends me

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:13.000
as an ardent carnivore I eat meat with every meal

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:15.000
every! I eat meat with breakfast

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:17.000
meat with lunch, meat with afternoon snack, meat with dinner

02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:19.000
meat with my late night snack

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:21.000
I eat meat like it's going out of style which after

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:23.000
going to my local whole foods it just might be

02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:25.000
the option of eating vegetable soup

02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:27.000
offends me as I feel meat should be not

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:29.000
only an option of what to eat at meals

02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:31.000
it should be THE option

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:33.000
now why should you listen to me? what does my opinion matter?

02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:35.000
my opinion matters because as a ginger

02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:37.000
mere asthmatic pudgy impotent male

02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:39.000
I represent the majority of gamers

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:41.000
and if I don't fuck it my opinion

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:43.000
is sacrosanct and my mommy

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:45.000
says I'm special

02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:47.000
I make this promise, if The Sims 3 is not updated

02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:49.000
to take the portion of eating vegetable soup

02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:51.000
out of the game I will post an online petition

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:53.000
that will surely be signed by many of the gamers

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:55.000
who identify and agree with me

02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:57.000
online petitions are no joke, think of all the things

02:10:57.000 --> 02:10:59.000
that have changed because of online petitions

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:01.000
think of it, you're truly redertainment

02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:03.000
satire over

02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:05.000
this message has been brought to you by the tachymeter

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:07.000
that collection of numbers

02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:09.000
on the outside of your

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:11.000
tachometer

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:13.000
that you have no idea what the fuck it's there for

02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:15.000
tachymeter is on your car

02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:17.000
to show you your rpms, right?

02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:19.000
so

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:21.000
yeah, I thought the parody though

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:23.000
was pretty funny, I mean it's

02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:25.000
pretty right on

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:27.000
I lulled

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:29.000
so what's the name of the guy from Bioware that did that old

02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:31.000
the David

02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:33.000
David something

02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:35.000
Spader?

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:37.000
no, that's an actor

02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:39.000
yeah, he's an actor

02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:41.000
there's an online petition

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:43.000
to get him fired because

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:45.000
I guess the same

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:47.000
sex options the NPCs in Dragon

02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:49.000
Age 2, whether it be the female

02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:51.000
what's her name, the Meryl?

02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:53.000
yeah, well the

02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:55.000
elf girl Meryl, yeah

02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:57.000
and then also the male equivalent which I guess are the easier

02:11:57.000 --> 02:11:59.000
options to hit on if you want to do

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:01.000
well I guess the person that put up this

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:03.000
petition is like, oh well this is just

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:05.000
stereotyping

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:07.000
gay and lesbian men and women as

02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:09.000
aggressive sex

02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:11.000
fiends but I think Meryl

02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:13.000
will hit on you no matter what gender you

02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:15.000
are okay, but just

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:17.000
and so will, I think

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:19.000
is Varick the dwarf

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:21.000
guy? yeah, I think they're just

02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:23.000
set to be attracted to

02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:25.000
the main person yeah

02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:27.000
but I just thought it was funny that

02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:29.000
he had put out that response to that

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:31.000
one idiot guy who wrote in

02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:33.000
but there's also just a petition to get him

02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:35.000
fired because I guess the gay and lesbian characters are

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:37.000
horny that's butt-tarded

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:39.000
if anyone's horny

02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:41.000
it's Isabella I found it

02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:43.000
here's the petition, it's on petition

02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:45.000
spot.com please don't visit it

02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:47.000
it says fire David Gator for

02:12:47.000 --> 02:13:09.000
stereotyping gays

02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:19.000
at me when I never found any interest

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:21.000
or even flirted with him this sort of thing shows

02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:23.000
that gays are unable to be normal people

02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:25.000
think nothing about sex

02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:27.000
this is the type of garbage that has people

02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:29.000
believe gays shouldn't serve in the military

02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:31.000
we are human beings that

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:33.000
are the same as everyone else please sign

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:35.000
this petition if you wish that Dragon Age

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:37.000
senior writer David Gator should be fired

02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:39.000

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:45.000
say we have, I'm just gonna use

02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:47.000
Meryl for example and she's

02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:49.000
hitting on my female rogue

02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:51.000
but in the male scenario she hits on

02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:53.000
the male rogue too and you

02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:55.000
reject her is that going to make her like

02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:57.000
you anymore is it gonna make her a little bit upset with you

02:13:57.000 --> 02:13:59.000
it doesn't matter

02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:01.000
gender she's still hitting on whoever

I don't know I brought that up to say that that

02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:41.000
Sims parody letter is awesome and that you can't

02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:43.000

have a problem with what you're doing

02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:49.000
this is people looking for drama where there is none

02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:51.000
it's like what is so boring

02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:53.000
in your life that you have to make drama to be upset

02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:55.000
about seriously

02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:57.000
the world is not about you

02:15:57.000 --> 02:15:59.000
my favorite though is that there are totally people

02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:01.000
trolling that particular like half of the signatures

02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:03.000
well there was one that I wanted you to read but it was obviously

02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:05.000
a troll one it was like some gay dude

02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:07.000
that wants to get

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:09.000
boned every day or something it was I don't know

02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:15.000

02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:17.000
hello olr first off I want to let you know that I'm typing

02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:19.000
this on my iphone so if there are any weird

02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:21.000
words it's probably autocorrect

02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:23.000
ok

02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:25.000
a while ago I emailed asking

02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:27.000
if either the olr crew or

02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:29.000
anyone in the chat room knew of any video game

02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:31.000
characters who wear knitted clothing like

02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:33.000
riku scarf in final fantasy 10 2

02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:35.000
or nora estheim's

02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:37.000
sweater in final fantasy 13

02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:39.000
I'm still looking for suggestions

02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:41.000
but I found another character

02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:43.000
final fantasy 3's lunath some purple sweater

02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:45.000
under his jacket that's true

02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:47.000
sky requested that I send some

02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:49.000
pics of past projects I've included some of

02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:51.000
my past works the gray afghan I'm working

02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:53.000
on now and that green scarf

02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:55.000
also doubled as a shawl for this

02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:57.000
petite model I'm looking forward

02:16:57.000 --> 02:16:59.000
for suggestions on video

02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:01.000
game characters knitted attire so let me know you should

02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:03.000
totally knit me stuff

02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:05.000
can you knit a mobius scarf?

02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:07.000
cause I totally want one anyway

02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:09.000
on a completely random note the other night I had

02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:11.000
a really screwed up dream where the three olr

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:13.000
hosts were included oh I don't know

02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:15.000
I'm afraid for some reason we were

02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:17.000
in some everglades slash marsh looking

02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:19.000
place and me and dark sakura

02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:21.000
were in one dune buggy and loki and sky were

02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:23.000
in another following us a building

02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:25.000
to our left exploded like a balloon filled with

02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:27.000
water as we drove by it for some

02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:29.000
reason they veered off the path and were following

02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:31.000
a higher path that swerved in and out of the main

02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:33.000
that we were on

02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:35.000
there was a small ditch in the path

02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:37.000
and we fell a little and hit a curb

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:39.000
and achieved some air time like we were in

02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:41.000
some dukes of hazard chase

02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:43.000
all four of us eventually reached our path

02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:45.000
which was my parents home

02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:47.000
which was bizarre cause they were white and I'm filipino

02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:49.000
we started

02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:51.000
getting chewed up by mosquitoes which

02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:53.000
woke I guess which means

02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:55.000
I woke up all itchy for some reason

02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:57.000
yeah I know totally random thanks

02:17:57.000 --> 02:17:59.000
for humoring me stan

02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:01.000
don't eat

02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:03.000
before you go to bed

02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:05.000
they make you dream

02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:07.000
weird shit or don't take night

02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:09.000
don't sleep with night quilt

02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:11.000
tonight on the

02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:13.000
orange lounge radio knitting and crocheting

02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:15.000
video game show we're gonna

02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:17.000
talk about how to knit

02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:19.000
a nice little scarf no I think this stuff is

02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:21.000
kinda neat actually

02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:23.000
we're there taking this

02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:25.000
one step further into the

02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:27.000
whole you know

02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:29.000
making tangible

02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:31.000
goods from video game inspired

02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:33.000
stuff and I know dark soccer you're really into

02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:35.000
this I'm surprised there aren't more people

02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:37.000
that kinda like crochet the whole like

02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:39.000
8 bit patterns using the

02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:41.000
old sprite graphics to like

02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:43.000
make those what are those things the

02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:45.000
needle point or whatever this is gonna be a

02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:47.000
beret yeah but I'm

02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:49.000
talking about like can't you like stitch a

02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:51.000
like sprite into those

02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:53.000
um you theoretically

02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:55.000
could on a crocheted item you just need

02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:57.000
the grid but um Becky does

02:18:57.000 --> 02:18:59.000
um needle point

02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:01.000
and then there's cross stitch

02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:03.000
I think in a recent issue

02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:05.000
of the official World of Warcraft

02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:07.000
magazine they feature a fan

02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:09.000
who does handmade plushies

02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:11.000
that are very intricate and exquisitely

02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:13.000
done she's not allowed to sell

02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:15.000
them but because they're so good

02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:17.000
they gave her a pictorial in the

02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:19.000
magazine so she makes like moonkin plushies

02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:21.000
and oh cute she cuts out the

02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:23.000
fabric and does it all I want a walrus

02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:25.000
person whatever they're called

02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:27.000
kolok or whatever

02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:29.000
these should be playable

02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:31.000
you never know alright

02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:33.000
and oh let's see the pictures

02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:35.000
oh I closed it hold on

02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:37.000
hold on

my chair has decided

02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:33.000

this red eye is from the camera Rob

02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:01.000
dun dun dun

02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:03.000
hi OLR seeing as the mailbag

02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:05.000
has been rather light as of late I thought I'd send

02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:07.000
an email for the upcoming show

02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:09.000
I just wanted to touch on a few subjects but I'll try to

02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:11.000
keep this email from going on too long

02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:13.000
you failed

02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:15.000
wall of words from back here

02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:17.000
wall of words

02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:19.000
wall of words crits you for 9,000 hit points

02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:21.000
hush hush hush

02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:23.000
first off

02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:25.000
as of the time I typed this on Thursday afternoon

02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:27.000
there's no notable free videos on the

02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:29.000
PSN video store

02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:31.000
if something were to be added between now and when

02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:33.000
the OLR airs

02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:35.000
or the OLR now

02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:37.000
I'll mention it either in chat or via Twitter topics

02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:39.000
although there's nothing good

02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:41.000
that's free so far I should mention

02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:43.000
that the PSN video store does have

02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:45.000
a petty decent

02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:47.000
I'm sure you meant pretty decent

02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:49.000
sale going on for the outright

02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:51.000
purchase of

02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:53.000
SD versions of miscellaneous comedy

02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:55.000
movies such as Airplane, Disaster Movie

02:21:55.000 --> 02:21:57.000
Joe Dirt, RV, Team America

02:21:57.000 --> 02:21:59.000
several MST3K titles, etc.

02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:01.000
as well as three stand-up

02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:03.000
comedy specials and select seasons of Super

02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:05.000
Jail, Aqua Teen Hunger Force

02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:07.000
and the anime series called

02:22:07.000 --> 02:22:09.000
Durarara the Complete Series

02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:11.000
excuse you

02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:13.000
the movies and stand-up specials are normally

02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:15.000
$10 while the other stuff is normally

02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:17.000
$2 but during the sale they're half

02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:19.000
off

02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:21.000
touch you

02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:23.000
on the subject of video stores I've noticed that the

02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:25.000
XBL-Zune video marketplace has been updated

02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:27.000
to include a new tab specifically

02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:29.000
for free TV shows, sneak previews, etc.

02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:31.000
this should be very helpful

02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:33.000
that stuff has been gooped

02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:35.000
grouped together

02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:37.000
in one place

02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:39.000
rather than having to hunt around

02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:41.000
for it at all

02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:43.000
lastly I want to

02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:45.000
touch on the PS3 version of Free Realms

02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:47.000
which has been released via PSN this past

02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:49.000
Tuesday although I haven't put enough time

02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:51.000
into it to give a full fair review

02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:53.000
of it I'd at least would like to give my

02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:55.000
early impressions of it which are mixed

02:22:55.000 --> 02:22:57.000
frankly there's a few couple

02:22:57.000 --> 02:22:59.000
a few a couple things hurting it

02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:01.000
was it a few or a couple?

02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:03.000
the game seriously needs a manual be it

02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:05.000
a PDF printed one or

02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:07.000
in-game which isn't included

02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:09.000
some things are easy to figure out while others are

02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:11.000
bigger pain in the ass than an appointment with

02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:13.000
one's proctologist

02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:15.000
while the game is a

02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:17.000
freemium title and trophies are supported

02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:19.000
you must have a subscription to unlock any trophies

02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:21.000
Sony kinda neglected to mention

02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:23.000
that early on and the only time they really

02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:25.000
said anything was in response to a question

02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:27.000
in the comment section to a

02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:29.000
post on the Playstation blog

02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:31.000
in terms of the

02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:33.000
game's overall appearance it can

02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:35.000
best be described as if Mr. Rogers

02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:37.000
had made a stew out of Barney the

02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:39.000
Teletubbies most Nickelodeon cartoons and the Power Rangers

02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:41.000
ate said stew then vomited

02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:43.000
all over a unicorn a bunny

02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:45.000
infested World of Warcraft

02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:47.000
whether this is a positive or negative

02:23:47.000 --> 02:23:49.000
is purely subjective and impersonal preference

02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:51.000
this email has been brought to you

02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:53.000
by Nyquil capital N small y big

02:23:53.000 --> 02:23:55.000
fucking Q Nyquil Nyquil Nyquil

02:23:55.000 --> 02:23:57.000
we love you you giant fucking Q

02:23:57.000 --> 02:23:59.000
see Dark Sakura I can quote

02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:01.000
Dennis Leary too

02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:03.000
that's it

02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:05.000
well

02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:07.000
I guess somebody kind of agrees with me on

02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:09.000
free realms

02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:11.000
that it's a horrible

02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:13.000
piece of crap game that makes

02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:15.000
no sense that you have no

02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:17.000
idea what to do not that there's anything wrong with that

02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:19.000
no I'm kidding I call it the

02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:21.000
sphincter of MMOs it's not the worst game

02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:23.000
I've ever played but it's just not good

02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:25.000
the sphincter of MMOs it's not

02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:27.000
the crap that comes out I don't know if it's the sphincter

02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:29.000
but it's definitely like the upper

02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:31.000
intestine

02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:33.000
well my reason for saying the sphincter

02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:35.000
is because it's not the crap

02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:37.000
it's just where the crap comes from

02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:39.000
okay you win

02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:41.000
let's get angsty

02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:43.000
do some angry rawr

02:24:43.000 --> 02:25:01.000
FUs of the week

02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:03.000
my FU goes towards the

02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:05.000
repaving of the sidewalk

02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:07.000
the street outside of my house

02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:09.000
because they're closing the street tomorrow

02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:11.000
and Tuesday from

02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:13.000
I wanna say 7 in the morning

02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:15.000
until 5 in the afternoon

02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:17.000
and

02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:19.000
I really shouldn't have to leave my house

02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:21.000
until like 9 to get to school

02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:23.000
because I'm making up time at school

02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:25.000
and instead I have to

02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:27.000
park my house a block away at

02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:29.000
my friend's house so that I could

02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:31.000
walk to my car in the morning and then go to school

02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:33.000
which is not that far I'm not complaining about walking

02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:35.000
but I complain about

02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:37.000
walking that I shouldn't have to do

02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:39.000
they should do this like

02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:41.000
at night

02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:43.000
with sound mufflers around them

02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:47.000
or they should give us money to be in communities

02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:49.000
but I guess we're getting any road out of this whatever

02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:51.000
money rocks

02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:53.000
Loki!

02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:55.000
um

02:25:55.000 --> 02:25:57.000
I don't know there's not a whole lot that I'm really mad about

02:25:57.000 --> 02:25:59.000
just I guess FU to lack of sleep

02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:01.000
because I haven't been getting a lot of sleep

02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:03.000
I have to wake up way early in the morning

02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:05.000
and

02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:07.000
you know one or two days isn't bad

02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:09.000
I've been doing it for 8 months straight now

02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:11.000
uh

02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:13.000
it takes a toll on you it makes you go a little crazy

02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:15.000
oh you were already

02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:17.000
crazy Loki

02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:19.000
I know and just compounded on top of that

02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:21.000
um

02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:23.000
I don't know I think it's been pretty good for me

02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:25.000
I don't really have a lot to say FU to do

02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:27.000
so yes FU to ants

02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:29.000
oh little bastards

02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:31.000
I hate them that's a good one thank you

02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:33.000
how about you?

02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:35.000
even if it's for really good reasons

02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:37.000
like a new job

02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:39.000
or you know

02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:41.000
just a new beginning or whatever

02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:43.000
the process of moving

02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:45.000
as an adult is one of the most

02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:47.000
annoying bullshitty things a grown

02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:49.000
person can do to themselves

02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:51.000
you've got to change your address

02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:53.000
get the stupid postal

02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:55.000
card pack up everything you own

02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:57.000
get friends to help you move

02:26:57.000 --> 02:26:59.000
even if

02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:01.000
it's awesome and nothing goes wrong

02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:03.000
moving is bullshit

02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:05.000
there you go

02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:07.000
moving is hard

02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:09.000
it's for grown ups

02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:11.000
no it stinks I don't like it

02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:13.000
anyhow that's it for the FUs of the week

02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:15.000
let's move on to a couple more stories

02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:17.000
and then your calls at 1877

02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:19.000
game OLR

02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:21.000
as if we didn't need more

02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:23.000
reasons to believe that there's gonna be

02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:25.000
a new Grand Theft Auto announced at E3

02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:27.000
uh

02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:29.000
well there's been a casting call for

02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:31.000
people to

02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:33.000
do some character

02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:35.000
voice over work and one of those

02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:37.000
characters happens to be from the Grand Theft Auto

02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:39.000
universe including

02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:41.000
the guy's name is James

02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:43.000
Pettison

02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:45.000
and he was a

02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:47.000
guess aside character

02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:49.000
at least in San Andreas

02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:51.000
where he openly

02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:53.000
recounted acts of pedophilia

02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:55.000
and in Grand Theft Auto 4

02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:57.000
he was arrested by the Indonesian police

02:27:57.000 --> 02:27:59.000
after being suspected of child molestation

02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:01.000
in Bali

02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:03.000
so

02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:05.000
yeah now apparently

02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:07.000
he's coming back in the next game and

02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:09.000
someone's gonna be doing the voice for him

02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:11.000
some other characters they name

02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:13.000
as well they're pretty generic sounding

02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:15.000
Samantha a young female

02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:17.000
obsessed with sex parties always dreaming

02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:19.000
of being a Hollywood celebrity

02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:21.000
um

02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:23.000
also let's see here

02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:25.000
uh

02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:27.000
uh

02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:29.000
what else there were some other characters

02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:31.000
I thought they were talking about too as well

02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:33.000
um a lot of like weird stuff

02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:35.000
um

02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:37.000
but yeah so probably

02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:39.000
new game coming out I would not be surprised

02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:41.000
next year so

02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:43.000
exciting I love it

02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:45.000
and the rumor is

02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:47.000
that it's supposed to be going back to Los Santos which

02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:49.000
was from San Andreas probably

02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:51.000
one of the best Grand Theft Auto games ever

02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:53.000
so I think a new

02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:55.000
Grand Theft Auto game is kind of a given so

02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:57.000
San Andreas was an analog

02:28:57.000 --> 02:28:59.000
of LA in that game

02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:01.000
Los Santos was

02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:03.000
Las Vegas or no? No, Los Santos

02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:05.000
was part of San Andreas remember cause there's three

02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:07.000
cities in San Andreas it was

02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:09.000
Los Santos, San Friere

02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:11.000
and Las Venturas

02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:13.000
Las Vegas

02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:15.000
yeah Vegas, San Francisco

02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:17.000
and Los Angeles

02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:19.000
yeah

02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:21.000
but that game was massive

02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:23.000
I have to really go back and play it

02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:25.000
get back from my sister

02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:27.000
why not wait for the next one?

02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:29.000
if you have a gaming PC get it on

02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:31.000
Steam for like five bucks and it's a lot better

02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:33.000
I have it on PC the last

02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:35.000
PC I tried running it on was my old laptop

02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:37.000
and that thing is a piece of shit I could probably run it on this

02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:39.000
really well

02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:41.000
but you know I've got it on

02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:43.000
I've got the old

02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:45.000
hot coffee disc

02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:47.000
from the Playstation 2

02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:49.000
my sister's been borrowing it forever

02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:51.000
and you know even though she doesn't need to

02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:53.000
cause there's a rip on the hard drive of that Playstation 2

02:29:53.000 --> 02:29:55.000
she has

02:29:55.000 --> 02:29:57.000
so I just need to get back and play it on my

02:29:57.000 --> 02:29:59.000
generation 1 Playstation 3 full backwards compatibility

02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:01.000
oh yeah

02:30:01.000 --> 02:30:03.000
alright

02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:05.000
well one more story for you guys before we get to the phone calls

02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:07.000
and this is about a man named Phil Fish

02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:09.000
and you might not know that game

02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:11.000
or you might not know that name but he is making the game

02:30:11.000 --> 02:30:13.000
Fez it's an indie game

02:30:13.000 --> 02:30:15.000
and it's going to be coming out on Xbox Live Arcade

02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:17.000
possibly the PC and the Playstation 3

02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:19.000
but probably not the Wii

02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:21.000
in an interview with

02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:23.000
Destructoid he was quoted saying

02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:25.000
quote right now we're only concentrating

02:30:25.000 --> 02:30:27.000
on XBLA which makes the most sense

02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:29.000
for us at the time

02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:31.000
PC and Playstation Network would also make a lot of sense

02:30:31.000 --> 02:30:33.000
but in my opinion WiiWare just wouldn't be worth

02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:35.000
our time and effort

02:30:35.000 --> 02:30:37.000
it's a dismal system that I don't want to deal with

02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:39.000
neither as a customer nor a developer

02:30:39.000 --> 02:30:41.000
no demos? Fuck off

02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:43.000
and that's a quote from this guy

02:30:43.000 --> 02:30:45.000
who told the WiiWare system it can go fuck off

02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:47.000
now granted this guy

02:30:47.000 --> 02:30:49.000
I don't want to say he's a nobody

02:30:49.000 --> 02:30:51.000
but his game hasn't really been proven yet

02:30:51.000 --> 02:30:53.000
he's one of those garage developers

02:30:53.000 --> 02:30:55.000
that Nintendo kind of doesn't want in their house anyway

02:30:55.000 --> 02:30:57.000
so I don't know

02:30:57.000 --> 02:30:59.000
if this story carries a lot of weight

02:30:59.000 --> 02:31:01.000
but I mean the guy did kind of have

02:31:01.000 --> 02:31:03.000
the balls to call out Nintendo

02:31:03.000 --> 02:31:05.000
but I kind of think it's not going to

02:31:05.000 --> 02:31:07.000
really change a goddamn thing in the scope of things

02:31:07.000 --> 02:31:09.000
but he really does have a point

02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:11.000
why do people keep developing for WiiWare when it's kind of shit?

02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:13.000
exactly

02:31:13.000 --> 02:31:15.000
and as I posted on Twitter

02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:17.000
earlier this week

02:31:17.000 --> 02:31:19.000
remember Nintendo was commenting

02:31:19.000 --> 02:31:21.000
on how they wanted to make sure

02:31:21.000 --> 02:31:23.000
they kept the garage developers out

02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:25.000
because in order to make sure

02:31:25.000 --> 02:31:27.000
that there's quality products coming out

02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:29.000
on WiiWare and DSiWare

02:31:29.000 --> 02:31:31.000
and stuff like that

02:31:31.000 --> 02:31:33.000
guess what came out on DSiWare this week?

02:31:33.000 --> 02:31:35.000
it was a program to take pictures of your friends

02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:37.000
and put them in funny Halloween themed

02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:39.000
backgrounds

02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:41.000
it looked like shit

02:31:41.000 --> 02:31:43.000
it looked like something that was on the iOS platform

02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:45.000
yay, clip art

02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:47.000
Halloween themed?

02:31:47.000 --> 02:31:49.000
I'm sorry, monster themed stuff

02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:51.000
I'm sorry, the best one on the iPhone

02:31:51.000 --> 02:31:53.000
was that heroin

02:31:53.000 --> 02:31:55.000
yeah, that was funny

02:31:55.000 --> 02:31:57.000
the make your friends fat application

02:31:57.000 --> 02:31:59.000
is funny too

02:31:59.000 --> 02:32:01.000
it was absolutely terrible

02:32:01.000 --> 02:32:03.000
and perfect week to come out

02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:05.000
right after they said

02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:07.000
oh, we need to make sure quality is on there

02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:09.000
that's some quality shit right there

02:32:09.000 --> 02:32:11.000
you're so much better

02:32:11.000 --> 02:32:13.000
than the iOS platform, what was I thinking

02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:15.000
even, you know, contemplating that you would

02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:17.000
ever allow something that terrible to be on

02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:19.000
your network

02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:21.000
oh, Nintendo, you don't need these garage

02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:23.000
developers at all, you got your Mario games

02:32:23.000 --> 02:32:25.000
that you're rehashing and putting out

02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:27.000
whatever, that's fine, they're better off

02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:29.000
you know, not going to the WiiWare service

02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:31.000
but seriously, I mean, come on

02:32:31.000 --> 02:32:33.000
demos, I mean, demos have been around

02:32:33.000 --> 02:32:35.000
for fucking years now, and you can't

02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:37.000
implement demos on your WiiWare service

02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:39.000
or you just don't want to because a lot of this shit

02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:41.000
is crap on there, and

02:32:41.000 --> 02:32:43.000
it's just terrible games

02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:45.000
oh, haha, you downloaded it too late

02:32:45.000 --> 02:32:47.000
hahaha, Nintendo just kinda doesn't get

02:32:47.000 --> 02:32:49.000
online, I think it's the same story

02:32:49.000 --> 02:32:51.000
every week, ok, they don't get online

02:32:51.000 --> 02:32:53.000
and they don't have any demos

02:32:53.000 --> 02:32:55.000
for Wii games, they don't have any

02:32:55.000 --> 02:32:57.000
demos for any, I mean they had

02:32:57.000 --> 02:32:59.000
demos one time for a select few

02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:01.000
WiiWare games, so it is possible

02:33:01.000 --> 02:33:03.000
they, eh, fuck it, we don't give a shit

02:33:03.000 --> 02:33:05.000
our customers don't need demos

02:33:05.000 --> 02:33:07.000
our quality speaks for itself

02:33:07.000 --> 02:33:09.000
it should be a no brainer, I must buy everything

02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:11.000
Nintendo

02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:13.000
the developers of

02:33:13.000 --> 02:33:15.000
Super Meat Boy, which I think is

02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:17.000
one of the most successful indie games since

02:33:17.000 --> 02:33:19.000
Braid really, the

02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:21.000
two studios that were most willing to work with them

02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:23.000
was XBLA and Steam

02:33:23.000 --> 02:33:25.000
Sony wasn't really interested in the

02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:27.000
game, and when they wanted to put out a

02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:29.000
WiiWare edition of Super Meat Boy

02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:31.000
they were fine with the no demo thing, but just the

02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:33.000
restrictions they had to put on the game

02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:35.000
really crippled it, they just cancelled the whole thing

02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:37.000
because the WiiWare platform and how

02:33:37.000 --> 02:33:39.000
big the game has to be was

02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:41.000
shitty. I mean, this is a company

02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:43.000
that thinks that users

02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:45.000
can't understand megabytes, they

02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:47.000
have to, you know, put it

02:33:47.000 --> 02:33:49.000
down to blocks, yeah, really, how is

02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:51.000
you know, five megabytes and

02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:53.000
five blocks any fucking different, I mean

02:33:53.000 --> 02:33:55.000
other than being really confusing

02:33:55.000 --> 02:33:57.000
to the fact that how many, you know

02:33:57.000 --> 02:33:59.000
When you have 64 and you take

02:33:59.000 --> 02:34:01.000
away two, you're left with

02:34:01.000 --> 02:34:03.000
62. Yeah, but then you have to figure

02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:05.000
out, okay, I have a two gigabyte memory card

02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:07.000
that's in my, you know, 3DS

02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:09.000
or in my Wii system, how many

02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:11.000
fucking blocks is that?

02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:13.000
I don't know.

02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:15.000
No one knows. Is the 3DS still speaking

02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:17.000
blocks? Yes it does. Oh god.

02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:19.000
Yes, it

02:34:19.000 --> 02:34:21.000
does, and because

02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:23.000
I mean, come on, man, everybody's

02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:25.000
using computers nowadays, everybody

02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:27.000
megabyte, the term megabyte's been

02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:29.000
around forever.

02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:31.000
Even if they don't, they have an 8 gig

02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:33.000
iPod, they know what 8 gig means,

02:34:33.000 --> 02:34:35.000
you know, the terminology

02:34:35.000 --> 02:34:37.000
is everywhere now. And even

02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:39.000
still though, why is it so hard to, you

02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:41.000
know, megabyte? Okay,

02:34:41.000 --> 02:34:43.000
well, I don't know what a megabyte

02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:45.000
is, but I know that I have this many

02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:47.000
on this memory card.

02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:49.000
How's that difficult?

02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:51.000
It's not, it really isn't, but

02:34:51.000 --> 02:34:53.000
for whatever reason, they decided, let's

02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:55.000
go ahead and do that again.

02:34:55.000 --> 02:34:57.000
It's just like they make a lot of poor

02:34:57.000 --> 02:34:59.000
decisions when it comes to different

02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:01.000
software and features that they have on

02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:03.000
these systems. Whatever, you know what,

02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:05.000
Nintendo, you can play this game as long

02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:07.000
as you want, and your system will be

02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:09.000
successful for a while, and eventually

02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:11.000
you're gonna hit that slump again.

02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:13.000
You're gonna hit that slump again, and

02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:15.000
then you're gonna be in fucking last

02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:17.000
place, and oh, all that shit, now you

02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:19.000
gotta catch up again. So

02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:21.000
ride the wave while you can, but

02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:23.000
eventually it's gonna come crashing down.

02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:25.000
Alright, well, let's

02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:27.000
get to the Skype line. We're gonna open that

02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:29.000
on up, 1-877-GAME-OLR,

02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:31.000
or our username on Skype is

02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:33.000
OrangeLoungeRadio. Give us a call,

02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:35.000
and we'll talk topics with you, if there's something

02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:37.000
you wanna cover that we've talked about earlier tonight, or

02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:39.000
maybe you wanna talk to us about something completely

02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:41.000
new. While we wait for some calls,

02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:43.000
cause there is a bit of a delay, Loki, do you have any

02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:45.000
last minute stories for us tonight? Yeah, I do have one

02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:47.000
thing. Sony is looking to dismiss

02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:49.000
the other OS lawsuit. Remember,

02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:51.000
there was people suing Sony

02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:53.000
for removing the other OS

02:35:53.000 --> 02:35:55.000
in the Playstation 3. I thought they dismissed that a long time ago.

02:35:55.000 --> 02:35:57.000
Well, no they didn't. It was actually going to courts and stuff.

02:35:57.000 --> 02:35:59.000
But here's the twist now. Sony wants

02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:01.000
access to all those people's hard

02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:03.000
drives that filed for the other

02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:05.000
OS lawsuits, because they're saying

02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:07.000
they may be part of a bigger hacker

02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:09.000
conspiracy. Thank you! So basically

02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:11.000
they're saying everybody that wanted Linux

02:36:11.000 --> 02:36:13.000
on their system, they're a hacker, and they're out to

02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:15.000
destroy Sony. Wasn't the government

02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:17.000
using it? Oh yeah, but they're hackers, and they're out

02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:19.000
to destroy Sony. Why put that in

02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:21.000
your system if you think that everybody's

02:36:21.000 --> 02:36:23.000
hackers out to destroy Sony?

02:36:23.000 --> 02:36:25.000
If Sony made the goddamn

02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:27.000
system, why don't they just make some

02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:29.000
program that lets them see what's in the system?

02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:31.000
I'm sure they could do that remotely, like a whole

02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:33.000
Skynet thing, right? It's just terrible, but here's the thing,

02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:35.000
I mean, well, if you think about it though,

02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:37.000
if they made some sort of program and they had it

02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:39.000
where you connected online to see that kind of stuff,

02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:41.000
that would update their system, and they

02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:43.000
would be unable to have the other OS

02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:45.000
in there, cause you can't update your system

02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:47.000
anymore if you want to keep that.

02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:49.000
But, the real,

02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:51.000
well, one reason they wanted to see the hard drives

02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:53.000
is to make sure that they actually did have other OS on,

02:36:53.000 --> 02:36:55.000
and this is their Playstation 3 hard drives,

02:36:55.000 --> 02:36:57.000
not their PCs. They wanted to make sure

02:36:57.000 --> 02:36:59.000
they had other OS on there, but

02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:01.000
at the same time though, and the judge doesn't understand,

02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:03.000
is when you put other OS on there,

02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:05.000
it's now a computer, and

02:37:05.000 --> 02:37:07.000
you need to go through the protocols

02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:09.000
for, you know, discovery for that kind of

02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:11.000
stuff where you have to have a third party company, look

02:37:11.000 --> 02:37:13.000
at the stuff, not Sony, going through

02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:15.000
and having full access to your

02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:17.000
hard drive of your now computer.

02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:19.000
Alright, let's go to the phones. Hi, you're on Orange

02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:21.000
Launch Radio, who's this? Hey, it's Ronma,

02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:23.000
what's up everyone? Your

02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:25.000
audio, I have to hang up.

02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:27.000
There's some terrible, terrible feedback that you've got

02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:29.000
going on, and he's probably sitting there going

02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:31.000
why did he hang up on us? But you've got some,

02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:33.000
I know you all heard that, right?

02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:35.000
Yeah, ow. So,

02:37:35.000 --> 02:37:37.000
you gotta fix that. Echo 123, buddy.

02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:39.000
He works every other week, I wonder what's wrong with

02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:41.000
tonight, let's see. Alright, let's try to go.

02:37:41.000 --> 02:37:43.000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:45.000
Sledge and Zaku here. Hey Zaku, what's up, buddy?

02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:47.000
Nothing much, just

02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:49.000
trying to recover for, you know, for a

02:37:49.000 --> 02:37:51.000
sleepy Sunday night watching, you know, listening

02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:53.000
to your show. But yeah,

02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:55.000
just going on the debate of how Nintendo's

02:37:55.000 --> 02:37:57.000
basically, like, you know, they're

02:37:57.000 --> 02:37:59.000
basically like, they're basically

02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:01.000
regressive at this point. I mean,

02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:03.000
they're pissing off devs to, you know,

02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:05.000
and it goes back to how

02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:07.000
too much pride they have, like,

02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:09.000
remember how they, like,

02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:11.000
covertly, you know,

02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:13.000
dissed, you know, the developers

02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:15.000
of Angry Birds? Yes, I remember that.

02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:17.000
The CEO actually, like,

02:38:17.000 --> 02:38:19.000
he actually, you know, he didn't mention

02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:21.000
it in a name, but he actually mentioned them

02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:23.000
in, you know, within that same

02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:25.000
aspect that they're just, like, bringing down

02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:27.000
the wages. Kind of like,

02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:29.000
you know, it's kind of like those, uh, you ever

02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:31.000
seen this episode of South Park where

02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:33.000
the, you know, the Goobacks episode

02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:35.000
and you see the guy shouting, they took our

02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:37.000
job. They took our jobs! It's

02:38:37.000 --> 02:38:39.000
pretty much like that. They're complaining about

02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:41.000
how, just because it's a

02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:43.000
zero-sum game, well,

02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:45.000
to them it appears to be a zero-sum game,

02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:47.000
that it's just, like,

02:38:47.000 --> 02:38:49.000
it's not worth, it doesn't pay to be a

02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:51.000
developer anymore. But on the other

02:38:51.000 --> 02:38:53.000
hand,

02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:55.000
Rovio, what their

02:38:55.000 --> 02:38:57.000
strategy is, as long as they get Angry Birds

02:38:57.000 --> 02:38:59.000
for a cheap price with a lot more

02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:01.000
replay value, then

02:39:01.000 --> 02:39:03.000
they've done their job in terms of getting

02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:05.000
people to play that game multiple

02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:07.000
times. And even if you did

02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:09.000
the analytics, if you tracked the number of

02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:11.000
people just, like, launching the game and going

02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:13.000
through levels, you would see

02:39:13.000 --> 02:39:15.000
that it's a pretty, it's a pretty big

02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:17.000
number. Even myself.

02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:19.000
Think of the shit-tons they're making, not just off the game

02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:21.000
itself, but all the license tie-ins

02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:23.000
now. I mean, maybe they have a plan on this thing again.

02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:25.000
They have a free version on the

02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:27.000
Android market that runs on ads alone.

02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:29.000
How many impressions, you know,

02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:31.000
how many impressions are that,

02:39:31.000 --> 02:39:33.000
you know, through AdSense? That's a lot.

02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:35.000
That, you know, they make a

02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:37.000
crap-ton of money instead of, you know, aside

02:39:37.000 --> 02:39:39.000
from selling it for 99 cents,

02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:41.000
which it pays for itself after a few plays.

02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:45.000
So Nintendo's just threatened by that lower

02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:47.000
price point? I mean, Nintendo also, God,

02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:49.000
go in any Hot Topic,

02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:51.000
and next to, like, one Angry Birds shirt,

02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:53.000
you'll see, like, 20 Nintendo

02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:55.000
classic franchise

02:39:55.000 --> 02:39:57.000
shirts, you know? Everybody has a...

02:39:57.000 --> 02:39:59.000
Nintendo lives off nostalgia, man.

02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:01.000
But that's the thing, is, like,

02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:03.000
Nintendo, on the other hand, can't...

02:40:03.000 --> 02:40:05.000
I know they basically are

02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:07.000
marketing... They've marketed the Wii

02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:09.000
as more of a casual gamer system,

02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:11.000
therefore, you know,

02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:13.000
setting aside

02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:15.000
all the, you know, all the

02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:17.000
hardcores that they marketed to in the past.

02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:19.000
I mean, that's pretty

02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:21.000
much it. As long as you're...

02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:23.000
What's happening is that they're getting

02:40:23.000 --> 02:40:25.000
outgunned by other, you know,

02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:27.000
more easily

02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:29.000
available platforms, like an iPhone

02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:31.000
or an Android. Something that most

02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:33.000
people would have in their pocket,

02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:35.000
aside from a DS.

02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:37.000
And it's more than capable of running those games.

02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:41.000
Alright, anything else on your mind tonight, Zaku?

02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:43.000
Um, Back to the

02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:45.000
Future of the Game, the first episode, is

02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:47.000
pretty much free from their

02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:49.000
Telltale Games site.

02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:51.000
Pretty awesome so far. Yeah, you having a good time with that?

02:40:51.000 --> 02:40:53.000
Although, even contrary to what the others are saying,

02:40:53.000 --> 02:40:55.000
it's, like, it's getting better.

02:40:55.000 --> 02:40:57.000
Like, I'm hearing the third episode's actually the best

02:40:57.000 --> 02:40:59.000
so far. I'm really excited

02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:01.000
for their Jurassic Park game. I don't know

02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:03.000
what it is, but, like, you know, they had a new trailer

02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:05.000
come in. It's like an adventure game where you just, like, click

02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:07.000
around to solve puzzles

02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:09.000
based on the storyline of the Back

02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:11.000
to the Future.

02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:13.000
And the guy who basically does

02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:15.000
Marty's voice is very close.

02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:17.000
Does almost a

02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:19.000
spot-on impression of Michael J. Fox.

02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:21.000
Nice. You have to actually listen to it, though.

02:41:21.000 --> 02:41:23.000
I do. I really need to play the Back

02:41:23.000 --> 02:41:25.000
to the Future. I forgot that it was

02:41:25.000 --> 02:41:27.000
the free, you know,

02:41:27.000 --> 02:41:29.000
time for it now that it's out. Because I remember

02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:31.000
the whole stories about the, you know, code

02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:33.000
word being in the Blu-ray and everything. So that's cool

02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:35.000
that it's out there for free now. So I'll definitely have to check that out.

02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:37.000
The first episode's out for free. Right.

02:41:37.000 --> 02:41:39.000
They're gonna get you on the other ones, though.

02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:41.000
Yeah. Alright. Well, Zaku,

02:41:41.000 --> 02:41:43.000
take care, buddy. We'll see you next time.

02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:45.000
Alright, bye.

02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:47.000
1877 Game OLR.

02:41:47.000 --> 02:41:49.000
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:41:49.000 --> 02:41:51.000
Was that it?

02:41:51.000 --> 02:41:53.000
You don't have any other stories for us, Loki?

02:41:53.000 --> 02:41:55.000
Uh, well, that was the only

02:41:55.000 --> 02:41:57.000
new one right now. Let me dig up

02:41:57.000 --> 02:41:59.000
some other stuff here real quick.

02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:01.000
Because, I don't know, it was kind of annoying

02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:03.000
that, uh, I think

02:42:03.000 --> 02:42:05.000
Oh, and the other thing, too,

02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:07.000
that should be noted with that is they're basically

02:42:07.000 --> 02:42:09.000
saying contradictory things

02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:11.000
in both cases, and they're on record saying

02:42:11.000 --> 02:42:13.000
contradictory things in both cases, so

02:42:13.000 --> 02:42:15.000
they're lying somewhere.

02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:17.000
Like, they're saying, oh,

02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:19.000
well, this other OS stuff, that's all

02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:21.000
Sony, Japan's, you know, doing.

02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:23.000
They're behind it. And then

02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:25.000
in the GeoHats case,

02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:27.000
or the GeorgeHats case, they're like,

02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:29.000
oh, that's Sony America. They're behind it.

02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:31.000
Which is it, Sony?

02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:33.000
You're on record saying both, so

02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:35.000
you've perjured yourself one way or another.

02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:39.000
Alright. We're gonna try this call

02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:41.000
again, see if it's better. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:43.000
It's Ranma. Can you hear me better

02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:45.000
now? Yes, and you're not giving that horrible

02:42:45.000 --> 02:42:47.000
feedback. I don't know what that was about.

02:42:47.000 --> 02:42:49.000
I think it's something with my computer.

02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:51.000
I think it's long overdue for a fresh Windows

02:42:51.000 --> 02:42:53.000
installation. Maybe Sony is trying to get

02:42:53.000 --> 02:42:55.000
inside your computer and see what you're really doing with it.

02:42:55.000 --> 02:42:57.000
Either that, maybe because Logitech

02:42:57.000 --> 02:42:59.000
is pissed because I dumped their headset

02:42:59.000 --> 02:43:01.000
for a better Microsoft one. SonyCat

02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:03.000
is watching you masturbate.

02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:05.000
I could give two shits about that. Alright.

02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:07.000
What's on your mind tonight?

02:43:07.000 --> 02:43:09.000
Something a little bit different,

02:43:09.000 --> 02:43:11.000
as, if you remember what we talked about

02:43:11.000 --> 02:43:13.000
in PM last week,

02:43:13.000 --> 02:43:15.000
I upgraded my phone.

02:43:15.000 --> 02:43:17.000
I now have an Android phone, and

02:43:17.000 --> 02:43:19.000
I'm doing something I thought

02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:21.000
I'd never find myself doing. What's that?

02:43:21.000 --> 02:43:23.000
Mobile gaming.

02:43:23.000 --> 02:43:25.000
Oh my gosh, alright.

02:43:25.000 --> 02:43:27.000
Took the plunge and did some mobile gaming.

02:43:27.000 --> 02:43:29.000
Now, do you have a phone that has actual

02:43:29.000 --> 02:43:31.000
tangible controls, or is it an

02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:33.000
all-touchscreen phone, like the iPhone?

02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:35.000
Both. I have the

02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:37.000
Samsung Epic 4G. Touchscreen,

02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:39.000
if I slide it out, I have keyboard

02:43:39.000 --> 02:43:41.000
access. Nice.

02:43:41.000 --> 02:43:43.000
But so far, the games I've played

02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:45.000
is completely in total touchscreen, which is not

02:43:45.000 --> 02:43:47.000
so bad, even with the

02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:49.000
screen protector on it.

02:43:49.000 --> 02:43:51.000
Well, what kind of games have you been playing? Tell us about

02:43:51.000 --> 02:43:53.000
some of the better ones.

02:43:53.000 --> 02:43:55.000
Well, you can probably assume I have

02:43:55.000 --> 02:43:57.000
that game everyone has been talking about,

02:43:57.000 --> 02:43:59.000
Angry Birds. Of course.

02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:01.000
I'm playing it, and I'm like, I can see

02:44:01.000 --> 02:44:03.000
why people are into it. It's like

02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:05.000
the new version of Worms

02:44:05.000 --> 02:44:07.000
or something like that, you know?

02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:09.000
And as

02:44:09.000 --> 02:44:11.000
I was going through the marketplace,

02:44:11.000 --> 02:44:13.000
I came across this one game that was probably

02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:15.000
you probably tickled pink over the name of it.

02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:17.000
Uh oh. It's called

02:44:17.000 --> 02:44:19.000
Pew Pew. Pew Pew!

02:44:19.000 --> 02:44:21.000
What is it?

02:44:21.000 --> 02:44:23.000
It has involved kittens with lasers?

02:44:23.000 --> 02:44:25.000
No, it's

02:44:25.000 --> 02:44:27.000
pretty much Geometry Wars.

02:44:27.000 --> 02:44:29.000
Oh, that's kinda cool. On Android.

02:44:29.000 --> 02:44:31.000
That's cool. And it has

02:44:31.000 --> 02:44:33.000
a couple of controllers on there

02:44:33.000 --> 02:44:35.000
so you can control and play, and I've been

02:44:35.000 --> 02:44:37.000
playing it, and the controlling is not so bad

02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:39.000
on it, and

02:44:39.000 --> 02:44:41.000
see, I picked up another game

02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:43.000
that I got from Joe of Data called

02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:45.000
Unfurry. That's like a block puzzle

02:44:45.000 --> 02:44:47.000
game, but it's pretty good.

02:44:47.000 --> 02:44:49.000
And as I'm going through the marketplace,

02:44:49.000 --> 02:44:51.000
I can understand why

02:44:51.000 --> 02:44:53.000
Nintendo said what they said.

02:44:53.000 --> 02:44:55.000
I think the GDC about these

02:44:55.000 --> 02:44:57.000
games on the 3DS,

02:44:57.000 --> 02:44:59.000
because I looked at them like,

02:44:59.000 --> 02:45:01.000
yeah, a lot of these games are total

02:45:01.000 --> 02:45:03.000
and utter crap. Call me crazy.

02:45:03.000 --> 02:45:05.000
If I'm dropping $250

02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:07.000
on a gaming comp, I'd like

02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:09.000
some quality games, you know?

02:45:09.000 --> 02:45:11.000
Right.

02:45:11.000 --> 02:45:13.000
You just don't want a bunch of free stuff

02:45:13.000 --> 02:45:15.000
that sucks.

02:45:15.000 --> 02:45:17.000
That's pretty much it. Now, if they

02:45:17.000 --> 02:45:19.000
do something along the lines of

02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:21.000
if a bunch of independent

02:45:21.000 --> 02:45:23.000
developers put together a bunch of these

02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:25.000
minigames together, and put together

02:45:25.000 --> 02:45:27.000
some type of collection

02:45:27.000 --> 02:45:29.000
for like $20 or something like that,

02:45:29.000 --> 02:45:31.000
that probably wouldn't be so bad.

02:45:31.000 --> 02:45:33.000
You know, funny enough, there's something like that on Steam, or at least

02:45:33.000 --> 02:45:35.000
there was. It was either April Fool's Day or the day after.

02:45:35.000 --> 02:45:37.000
There was like 13 independent games

02:45:37.000 --> 02:45:39.000
going for like maybe $29

02:45:39.000 --> 02:45:41.000
or $39, and one of them

02:45:41.000 --> 02:45:43.000
was like Super Meat Boy. There was some big titles

02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:45.000
in there. VVV, which I think Act F's

02:45:45.000 --> 02:45:47.000
called in about before it was in there.

02:45:47.000 --> 02:45:49.000
Yeah, I remember that.

02:45:49.000 --> 02:45:51.000
High Profile Indie Games was in this big pack

02:45:51.000 --> 02:45:53.000
lately, so sometimes the indie games will

02:45:53.000 --> 02:45:55.000
band together for big sales like that.

02:45:55.000 --> 02:45:57.000
Definitely.

02:45:57.000 --> 02:45:59.000
And I started to notice that,

02:45:59.000 --> 02:46:01.000
yeah, I'm playing around with

02:46:01.000 --> 02:46:03.000
these games more than my

02:46:03.000 --> 02:46:05.000
DS, because my phone is right there.

02:46:05.000 --> 02:46:07.000
Pull it out, hit the button, the game

02:46:07.000 --> 02:46:09.000
starts. Whereas I gotta pull it out of my

02:46:09.000 --> 02:46:11.000
bag, fire it up, pick the game,

02:46:11.000 --> 02:46:13.000
and start it up, you know? I guess it's like

02:46:13.000 --> 02:46:15.000
convenience. It's a portable system where you don't have

02:46:15.000 --> 02:46:17.000
to think about grabbing the system. You just, you always

02:46:17.000 --> 02:46:19.000
have it on you.

02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:21.000
And definitely, yes.

02:46:21.000 --> 02:46:23.000
There you go. Well, congratulations

02:46:23.000 --> 02:46:25.000
on jumping into mobile gaming.

02:46:25.000 --> 02:46:27.000
Anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?

02:46:27.000 --> 02:46:29.000
Yeah, something that I think

02:46:29.000 --> 02:46:31.000
Jamie would greatly appreciate.

02:46:31.000 --> 02:46:33.000
What is that?

02:46:33.000 --> 02:46:35.000
DDR Dollar Bill went to Megacon, and he

02:46:35.000 --> 02:46:37.000
got me this shirt. It says

02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:39.000
on the back,

02:46:39.000 --> 02:46:41.000
KOKRK,

02:46:41.000 --> 02:46:43.000
King of Kong, Orlando, Florida.

02:46:43.000 --> 02:46:45.000
And on the front it says,

02:46:45.000 --> 02:46:47.000
Never Surrender, Never,

02:46:47.000 --> 02:46:49.000
Billy Mitchell.

02:46:49.000 --> 02:46:51.000
And I just noticed

02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:53.000
that it's a limited

02:46:53.000 --> 02:46:55.000
edition shirt with his signature.

02:46:55.000 --> 02:46:57.000
It says, Billy Mitchell

02:46:57.000 --> 02:46:59.000
Video Game Player of the Century.

02:46:59.000 --> 02:47:01.000
How about Jerkface

02:47:01.000 --> 02:47:03.000
of the Century? I like that

02:47:03.000 --> 02:47:05.000
even better.

02:47:05.000 --> 02:47:07.000
Aw, I'm sure he's a nice guy.

02:47:07.000 --> 02:47:09.000
No, he's not actually.

02:47:09.000 --> 02:47:11.000
He's a big jerk.

02:47:11.000 --> 02:47:13.000
No, I've never talked to the guy.

02:47:13.000 --> 02:47:15.000
But he apparently sells really good barbecue sauce?

02:47:15.000 --> 02:47:17.000
Hey.

02:47:17.000 --> 02:47:19.000
That works. Let me be the judge of that, because I love

02:47:19.000 --> 02:47:21.000
my barbecue sauce. Me too.

02:47:21.000 --> 02:47:23.000
Alright, Rama, we're gonna let you go, try to fit in one more

02:47:23.000 --> 02:47:25.000
call before we end the Skype tonight, so take care, buddy.

02:47:25.000 --> 02:47:27.000
Wonderful. Bye.

02:47:27.000 --> 02:47:29.000
Alright.

02:47:29.000 --> 02:47:31.000
Let's see if we can take one more call

02:47:31.000 --> 02:47:33.000
on the Skype line. 1-877-GAME-OLR

02:47:33.000 --> 02:47:35.000
or our username on Skype is

02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:37.000
OrangeLoungeRadio. Any other

02:47:37.000 --> 02:47:39.000
stories?

02:47:39.000 --> 02:47:41.000
Yeah, there's a new game, I don't know if you've

02:47:41.000 --> 02:47:43.000
ever played the game QWOP.

02:47:43.000 --> 02:47:45.000
Remember QWOP?

02:47:45.000 --> 02:47:47.000
I have not played QWOP. I've played a lot of crap.

02:47:47.000 --> 02:47:49.000
I have.

02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:51.000
Anyways, there's a new game called

02:47:51.000 --> 02:47:53.000
GURP, and it's a rock climbing game

02:47:53.000 --> 02:47:55.000
that requires you to basically

02:47:55.000 --> 02:47:57.000
kind of

02:47:57.000 --> 02:47:59.000
bend your fingers in

02:47:59.000 --> 02:48:01.000
almost a twister type of way

02:48:01.000 --> 02:48:03.000
using the shift keys, the mouse buttons,

02:48:03.000 --> 02:48:05.000
or shift keys are the mouse buttons, and you have to hit

02:48:05.000 --> 02:48:07.000
certain letters

02:48:07.000 --> 02:48:09.000
on your keyboard in order to climb,

02:48:09.000 --> 02:48:11.000
and you have to avoid this rising water.

02:48:11.000 --> 02:48:13.000
And if it's anything like QWOP, it's really

02:48:13.000 --> 02:48:15.000
damn hard. Impossible, yeah.

02:48:15.000 --> 02:48:17.000
Alright, let's take one more

02:48:17.000 --> 02:48:19.000
call here on the Skype line before we call tonight.

02:48:19.000 --> 02:48:21.000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

02:48:21.000 --> 02:48:23.000
This is DT.

02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:25.000
Hey, DarkTets Studio, what's up, buddy?

02:48:25.000 --> 02:48:27.000
Oh, I

02:48:27.000 --> 02:48:29.000
think you can probably guess. I know, I was gonna

02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:31.000
say, this has got to be about

02:48:31.000 --> 02:48:33.000
WonderCon. I know you were really excited

02:48:33.000 --> 02:48:35.000
about your trip out to WonderCon, which happened this week.

02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:37.000
Tell us about some of the games you saw at

02:48:37.000 --> 02:48:39.000
WonderCon.

02:48:39.000 --> 02:48:41.000
Oh, man. Well, Nintendo

02:48:41.000 --> 02:48:43.000
had a huge boost, and they were showing off

02:48:43.000 --> 02:48:45.000
all of the 3DS games they had

02:48:45.000 --> 02:48:47.000
that.

02:48:47.000 --> 02:48:49.000
Did anything

02:48:49.000 --> 02:48:51.000
catch your eyes

02:48:51.000 --> 02:48:53.000
over there? It was pretty cool?

02:48:53.000 --> 02:48:55.000
Well, I like

02:48:55.000 --> 02:48:57.000
that a little bit. Steel Diver.

02:48:57.000 --> 02:48:59.000
Uh-huh.

02:48:59.000 --> 02:49:01.000
It was pretty cool. Was that the first time you ever got to

02:49:01.000 --> 02:49:03.000
touch 3- was that the first time you ever got to get your hands on

02:49:03.000 --> 02:49:05.000
a 3DS? Yeah. What'd you think about

02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:07.000
3D? What'd you think about it when you, like, first

02:49:07.000 --> 02:49:09.000
saw it?

02:49:09.000 --> 02:49:11.000
Oh, yeah, it was pretty neat. Yeah, did you

02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:13.000
do that whole thing, like, cause I know I do

02:49:13.000 --> 02:49:15.000
this the first time. Like, you know, you

02:49:15.000 --> 02:49:17.000
know you're about to play a system that's 3D with

02:49:17.000 --> 02:49:19.000
no glasses, but then you, like, you know, you're kinda

02:49:19.000 --> 02:49:21.000
like, you have that little bit of a doubt where you're like,

02:49:21.000 --> 02:49:23.000
oh, this is gonna be stupid. And then, like, you

02:49:23.000 --> 02:49:25.000
pick it up and you're like, whoa, you kinda have

02:49:25.000 --> 02:49:27.000
that moment of, whoa, it really is 3D.

02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:29.000
Oh, yeah.

02:49:29.000 --> 02:49:31.000
Yeah, so.

02:49:31.000 --> 02:49:33.000
Batman also had, uh, Kate

02:49:33.000 --> 02:49:35.000
Icarus demo. Oh, did they?

02:49:35.000 --> 02:49:37.000
Nice. Was it playable

02:49:37.000 --> 02:49:39.000
or was it just, like, a trailer?

02:49:39.000 --> 02:49:41.000
Yeah, no, it was playable. Oh,

02:49:41.000 --> 02:49:43.000
shit, nice. I felt like, uh, unless you ever played

02:49:43.000 --> 02:49:45.000
Sin and Punishment. Uh-huh.

02:49:45.000 --> 02:49:47.000
Yeah, it kinda

02:49:47.000 --> 02:49:49.000
felt like that. Nice. By the way,

02:49:49.000 --> 02:49:51.000
Sin and Punishment was- Lion with the analog stick

02:49:51.000 --> 02:49:53.000
and the name was the- Sin

02:49:53.000 --> 02:49:55.000
and Punishment was another one of those games that

02:49:55.000 --> 02:49:57.000
Fry's, that they had, like, 20 extra copies of

02:49:57.000 --> 02:49:59.000
that they were trying to get rid of. The, uh, new

02:49:59.000 --> 02:50:01.000
one that was out on the Wii. Mm.

02:50:01.000 --> 02:50:03.000
It's unfortunate. Anyway, sorry about that,

02:50:03.000 --> 02:50:05.000
DT. Yeah, I'm sorry.

02:50:05.000 --> 02:50:07.000
But, uh, okay, well, what other,

02:50:07.000 --> 02:50:09.000
what other, like, did Capcom have anything? I

02:50:09.000 --> 02:50:11.000
know you always try to run over there and look at their booth.

02:50:11.000 --> 02:50:13.000
Oh, yeah, well,

02:50:13.000 --> 02:50:15.000
most of the stuff they had, those stuff was already

02:50:15.000 --> 02:50:17.000
out, but they did have Resident Evil,

02:50:17.000 --> 02:50:19.000
which was, well, it's alright, I guess.

02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:21.000
Oh, cool.

02:50:21.000 --> 02:50:23.000
Mm-hmm.

02:50:23.000 --> 02:50:25.000
Um, what else?

02:50:25.000 --> 02:50:27.000
Any other games?

02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:29.000
Uh, let's

02:50:29.000 --> 02:50:31.000
see, they had the, all the

02:50:31.000 --> 02:50:33.000
big movie, comic book movie games,

02:50:33.000 --> 02:50:35.000
like Thor and Captain America and

02:50:35.000 --> 02:50:37.000
Green Lantern. Oh, yeah, god,

02:50:37.000 --> 02:50:39.000
there's gonna be a ton of those this summer with all the

02:50:39.000 --> 02:50:41.000
comic book movies coming out. Oh, yeah, we have Thor,

02:50:41.000 --> 02:50:43.000
Green Lantern, there's an X-Men movie

02:50:43.000 --> 02:50:45.000
as well, right, the first class? It's crap.

02:50:45.000 --> 02:50:47.000
I know, I so don't wanna see it, I don't care.

02:50:47.000 --> 02:50:49.000
Uh, what else is there?

02:50:49.000 --> 02:50:51.000
I think there's, um,

02:50:51.000 --> 02:50:53.000
I feel like I'm missing some huge ones.

02:50:53.000 --> 02:50:55.000
Oh, well, whatever.

02:50:55.000 --> 02:50:57.000
What, huge? Comic book movies.

02:50:57.000 --> 02:50:59.000
Comic book movies. There's Thor,

02:50:59.000 --> 02:51:01.000
there's Captain America, Green Lantern,

02:51:01.000 --> 02:51:03.000
Green Lantern, there's the big three.

02:51:03.000 --> 02:51:05.000
There's X-Men First Class,

02:51:05.000 --> 02:51:07.000
there's the Spider-Man reboot this year, or is that next year?

02:51:07.000 --> 02:51:09.000
No, that's not for a while.

02:51:09.000 --> 02:51:11.000
And, um,

02:51:11.000 --> 02:51:13.000
but they're also, I think, gonna

02:51:13.000 --> 02:51:15.000
be rebooting Fantastic Four,

02:51:15.000 --> 02:51:17.000
Transformers, if you wanna count that as, uh,

02:51:17.000 --> 02:51:19.000
another Superman,

02:51:19.000 --> 02:51:21.000
and, uh, Batman.

02:51:21.000 --> 02:51:23.000
Oh, yeah, Batman 3 is next year, and that I'm

02:51:23.000 --> 02:51:25.000
excited about, but I don't know how the game would be.

02:51:25.000 --> 02:51:27.000
Well, I did see your write-up,

02:51:27.000 --> 02:51:29.000
uh, is available over at OrangeLoungeRadio.com,

02:51:29.000 --> 02:51:31.000
so it looks like you kept a little dear diary

02:51:31.000 --> 02:51:33.000
while you were there, and saw stuff.

02:51:33.000 --> 02:51:35.000
Now, I have to ask, did you get to see the masquerade at all?

02:51:35.000 --> 02:51:37.000
Uh,

02:51:37.000 --> 02:51:39.000
a little bit, it's a bunch of costumes

02:51:39.000 --> 02:51:41.000
all over. Did you see,

02:51:41.000 --> 02:51:43.000
by chance, the, um,

02:51:43.000 --> 02:51:45.000
Main Street Electronica Parade?

02:51:45.000 --> 02:51:47.000
Oh, no,

02:51:47.000 --> 02:51:49.000
I didn't see that.

02:51:49.000 --> 02:51:51.000
One of my friends was in that, and that, uh,

02:51:51.000 --> 02:51:53.000
she's been on the show before, Victoria, I think,

02:51:53.000 --> 02:51:55.000
filled in one week when Jamie wasn't here.

02:51:55.000 --> 02:51:57.000
She was one of the gals in the, it was a, uh,

02:51:57.000 --> 02:51:59.000
they did the Main Street Electrical Parade, but with

02:51:59.000 --> 02:52:01.000
a Tron theme, like the Tron guy was stuck

02:52:01.000 --> 02:52:03.000
in the Main Street Electric Parade.

02:52:03.000 --> 02:52:05.000
Yeah, it was pretty awesome.

02:52:05.000 --> 02:52:07.000
They didn't win! They were robbed!

02:52:07.000 --> 02:52:09.000
Of course, I didn't see the winning video, but I'm extremely

02:52:09.000 --> 02:52:11.000
biased. Extremely biased.

02:52:11.000 --> 02:52:13.000
So, alright, well, DT, I'm glad you had fun

02:52:13.000 --> 02:52:15.000
at the show. You know, we will actually have to go

02:52:15.000 --> 02:52:17.000
some year. This was just really not a good year

02:52:17.000 --> 02:52:19.000
for me to go, but I am hoping we will go

02:52:19.000 --> 02:52:21.000
to Find Me this year. That is

02:52:21.000 --> 02:52:23.000
something we're trying to do, so we'll see. Alright.

02:52:23.000 --> 02:52:25.000
Oh, we're gonna go back next year, so.

02:52:25.000 --> 02:52:27.000
Awesome. Well, we'll try to make it next year.

02:52:27.000 --> 02:52:29.000
Alright. Alright. Take care and check out

02:52:29.000 --> 02:52:31.000
that article at orangelawnsready.com by DT.

02:52:31.000 --> 02:52:33.000
Alright, bye guys!

02:52:33.000 --> 02:52:35.000
Yep.

02:52:35.000 --> 02:52:37.000
I don't know why I said guys. I was saying bye to you guys.

02:52:37.000 --> 02:52:39.000
Bye to you guys. I'm gonna go read that article. Alright.

02:52:39.000 --> 02:52:41.000
No, it is about time to say bye, guys.

02:52:41.000 --> 02:52:43.000
The show's about over.

02:52:43.000 --> 02:52:45.000
Thanks, you guys, though, for tuning in to us. We're gonna

02:52:45.000 --> 02:52:47.000
close up the Skype line. If you didn't get through tonight,

02:52:47.000 --> 02:52:49.000
sorry. Try sending us an

02:52:49.000 --> 02:52:51.000
email next time. Mailbag

02:52:51.000 --> 02:52:53.000
at orangelawnsready.com is the place where you

02:52:53.000 --> 02:52:55.000
can send us an email.

02:52:55.000 --> 02:52:57.000
Let me ask Loki one more time if there's any last minute

02:52:57.000 --> 02:52:59.000
stories before we wrap it all up. Yeah, there's

02:52:59.000 --> 02:53:01.000
a leaked Forza 4 pitch

02:53:01.000 --> 02:53:03.000
video that was supposed to be, I think, part of their

02:53:03.000 --> 02:53:05.000
E3 presentation, and

02:53:05.000 --> 02:53:07.000
basically confirmed everything that

02:53:07.000 --> 02:53:09.000
was already leaked out regarding

02:53:09.000 --> 02:53:11.000
Forza 4, including the head tracking,

02:53:11.000 --> 02:53:13.000
the Kinect

02:53:13.000 --> 02:53:15.000
integration, that kind of stuff.

02:53:15.000 --> 02:53:17.000
Good stuff.

02:53:17.000 --> 02:53:19.000
Head tracking, pretty awesome. They were saying, yes, you'll

02:53:19.000 --> 02:53:21.000
be able to use head tracking to look into the corners

02:53:21.000 --> 02:53:23.000
when you're driving and stuff. Although, that's a little

02:53:23.000 --> 02:53:25.000
awkward for me.

02:53:25.000 --> 02:53:27.000
I think because if your TV's in front of you,

02:53:27.000 --> 02:53:29.000
you can't really turn your head to the side.

02:53:29.000 --> 02:53:31.000
It's gonna be a little weird, yeah.

02:53:31.000 --> 02:53:33.000
It'd be cool if the multiple

02:53:33.000 --> 02:53:35.000
monitors support or whatever, but

02:53:35.000 --> 02:53:37.000
once again, why would you need

02:53:37.000 --> 02:53:39.000
head tracking if you have multiple monitors?

02:53:39.000 --> 02:53:41.000
But hey,

02:53:41.000 --> 02:53:43.000
glad to see they're using head tracking,

02:53:43.000 --> 02:53:45.000
so that'll be awesome.

02:53:45.000 --> 02:53:47.000
Alright, very cool.

02:53:47.000 --> 02:53:49.000
This might be a little hint of what is to come

02:53:49.000 --> 02:53:51.000
for the next generation of Kinect, and this could be very,

02:53:51.000 --> 02:53:53.000
very good. Yeah. So we'll see.

02:53:53.000 --> 02:53:55.000
Alright, well it's that time of the show where we go around

02:53:55.000 --> 02:53:57.000
and get everybody's final thought as we wrap

02:53:57.000 --> 02:53:59.000
up another week here at Orange Lounge Radio.

02:53:59.000 --> 02:54:01.000
SalaciousPop, thanks again for being here.

02:54:01.000 --> 02:54:03.000
You did a lot of talking this week. I'm very proud of you.

02:54:03.000 --> 02:54:05.000
Alright, so thanks, and do you have

02:54:05.000 --> 02:54:07.000
any final thoughts for our listeners?

02:54:11.000 --> 02:54:13.000
No.

02:54:13.000 --> 02:54:15.000
Alright then, alright.

02:54:15.000 --> 02:54:17.000
Let's see, Dark Soccer, I guess I'll go to you next.

02:54:17.000 --> 02:54:19.000
Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

02:54:19.000 --> 02:54:21.000
I want more pinkberry.

02:54:21.000 --> 02:54:23.000
And my final thought along

02:54:23.000 --> 02:54:25.000
those lines is that the Lychee

02:54:25.000 --> 02:54:27.000
pinkberry can go to hell.

02:54:27.000 --> 02:54:29.000
Blood orange forever. It's not gross.

02:54:29.000 --> 02:54:31.000
It's good. It's not blood orange.

02:54:31.000 --> 02:54:33.000
But the mango is amazing.

02:54:33.000 --> 02:54:35.000
Eh, whatever. It's not blood orange.

02:54:35.000 --> 02:54:37.000
Alright, Loki, your final thoughts tonight?

02:54:37.000 --> 02:54:39.000
Um...

02:54:39.000 --> 02:54:41.000
I don't know.

02:54:41.000 --> 02:54:43.000
I'm down to

02:54:43.000 --> 02:54:45.000
my US 3DS system.

02:54:45.000 --> 02:54:47.000
I got rid of all the rest.

02:54:47.000 --> 02:54:49.000
Aww.

02:54:49.000 --> 02:54:51.000
Aww, that's great.

02:54:51.000 --> 02:54:53.000
Did the wife catch you?

02:54:53.000 --> 02:54:55.000
No.

02:54:55.000 --> 02:54:57.000
He was like, why would she?

02:54:57.000 --> 02:54:59.000
And then you're gonna come home,

02:54:59.000 --> 02:55:01.000
and be like, what?

02:55:01.000 --> 02:55:03.000
No, she doesn't listen to the show.

02:55:03.000 --> 02:55:05.000
I was talking to her last week.

02:55:05.000 --> 02:55:07.000
She listened for just a minute.

02:55:07.000 --> 02:55:09.000
It was like...

02:55:09.000 --> 02:55:11.000
Just long enough for a baby to hear daddy.

02:55:11.000 --> 02:55:13.000
Pretty much, yeah.

02:55:13.000 --> 02:55:15.000
She's trying to get him

02:55:15.000 --> 02:55:17.000
for two naps tonight.

02:55:17.000 --> 02:55:19.000
Last night he woke up

02:55:19.000 --> 02:55:21.000
with me, I woke up with him at five.

02:55:21.000 --> 02:55:23.000
I usually wake up with him at five in the morning.

02:55:23.000 --> 02:55:25.000
Every day.

02:55:25.000 --> 02:55:27.000
On the weekends even.

02:55:27.000 --> 02:55:29.000
And so he wouldn't go

02:55:29.000 --> 02:55:31.000
back down to bed for like about an hour.

02:55:31.000 --> 02:55:33.000
He was just trying to get him to go back down.

02:55:33.000 --> 02:55:35.000
And he finally slept till

02:55:35.000 --> 02:55:37.000
seven forty, but...

02:55:37.000 --> 02:55:39.000
I'm actually now able to be

02:55:39.000 --> 02:55:41.000
wide awake at five in the morning.

02:55:41.000 --> 02:55:43.000
Which works out, because I can work on my PC sometimes.

02:55:43.000 --> 02:55:45.000
You know, and able to work on

02:55:45.000 --> 02:55:47.000
Grand Theft Auto map edits and stuff like that

02:55:47.000 --> 02:55:49.000
really in the morning without being interrupted.

02:55:49.000 --> 02:55:51.000
But, uh...

02:55:51.000 --> 02:55:53.000
It's tough.

02:55:53.000 --> 02:55:55.000
I have to take naps now on the weekends

02:55:55.000 --> 02:55:57.000
sometimes, because

02:55:57.000 --> 02:55:59.000
there's only so many days you can wake up that early

02:55:59.000 --> 02:56:01.000
and not be affected by it.

02:56:01.000 --> 02:56:03.000
Well, Rob naps every day and he doesn't even have a kid.

02:56:03.000 --> 02:56:05.000
So, don't feel too bad.

02:56:05.000 --> 02:56:07.000
Hey, you've earned those naps.

02:56:07.000 --> 02:56:09.000
Ring ring, hi pot, it's kettle on the phone.

02:56:09.000 --> 02:56:11.000
I wanted to say,

02:56:11.000 --> 02:56:13.000
and I know they're not listening obviously,

02:56:13.000 --> 02:56:15.000
and I don't think they listen normally,

02:56:15.000 --> 02:56:17.000
but congratulations to our friends

02:56:17.000 --> 02:56:19.000
Eric and Mel for their brand new baby girl.

02:56:19.000 --> 02:56:21.000
Cute baby!

02:56:21.000 --> 02:56:23.000
Someone finally had a girl.

02:56:23.000 --> 02:56:25.000
I know, it's like a big sausage fest,

02:56:25.000 --> 02:56:27.000
but finally

02:56:27.000 --> 02:56:29.000
finally getting some girls in here.

02:56:29.000 --> 02:56:31.000
Alright.

02:56:31.000 --> 02:56:33.000
Alright, well that does it for another week

02:56:33.000 --> 02:56:35.000
here at Orange Lounge Radio.

02:56:35.000 --> 02:56:37.000
Thank you guys so much for tuning in and supporting independent radio.

02:56:37.000 --> 02:56:39.000
You know, all we ask if you like our show,

02:56:39.000 --> 02:56:41.000
help us spread the word. We don't have big budget

02:56:41.000 --> 02:56:43.000
advertising dollars. Say something nice about us

02:56:43.000 --> 02:56:45.000
on a forum. Tell your friends about the show.

02:56:45.000 --> 02:56:47.000
Leave us a nice review on iTunes. Anything you can do to help

02:56:47.000 --> 02:56:49.000
spread the word of Orange Lounge Radio would be

02:56:49.000 --> 02:56:51.000
much appreciated.

02:56:51.000 --> 02:56:53.000
And next week, we'll be back to do it all again

02:56:53.000 --> 02:56:55.000
one more time, episode 409.

02:56:55.000 --> 02:56:57.000
I guess that means we have to do some cleaning next week

02:56:57.000 --> 02:56:59.000
because it's 409. Hey, I cleaned that desk.

02:56:59.000 --> 02:57:01.000
You did. It better not need cleaning next week.

02:57:01.000 --> 02:57:03.000
I'll dirty it up. It isn't, it's

02:57:03.000 --> 02:57:05.000
dust free, lemony fresh.

02:57:05.000 --> 02:57:07.000
But shirmy tainted.

02:57:07.000 --> 02:57:09.000
Well of course, duh.

02:57:09.000 --> 02:57:11.000
Alright, that does it. Have a wonderful

02:57:11.000 --> 02:57:13.000
week everybody. We'll see you next time here at

02:57:13.000 --> 02:57:15.000
