Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Who's your hosts? Dark Sakura, Sky, and Lotu!

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
Tonight, April 10th, 2011, has the 3DS sold up to expectations in Japan,

00:19.000 --> 00:27.000
a new Sonic game is revealed, and after many years, a fan Streets of Rage remake is released.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio,

00:36.000 --> 00:41.000
the show where every gamer has a voice. We do tape live every Sunday night at All Games Radio,

00:41.000 --> 00:45.000
www.allgames.com, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
My name is Rob Roberts, I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-host,

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers!

00:51.000 --> 00:55.000
Rob has renewed my faith in computing.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
How's that?

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
By giving me a task of revival.

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
You're gonna CPR on one of my dead computers, yeah.

01:02.000 --> 01:08.000
Because I've needed, I've been going through this dilemma where I can't get Maya working on my computer,

01:08.000 --> 01:14.000
and I'm gonna put Windows 7 and Dual Boot Linux on it, but in the meantime it's like, I still really want a Mac.

01:14.000 --> 01:20.000
And I have a Mac, it's old, and as far as I know it doesn't work, and I replaced the laptop a long time ago,

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
I just ended up getting a PC laptop because it was really cheap and I didn't have a lot of money at the time.

01:24.000 --> 01:29.000
So yeah, the PC one's been serving me fine, so if you can revive that Mac one, shit, have fun with it.

01:29.000 --> 01:33.000
The other thought is I'm gonna put Linux on it.

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
Of course. When in doubt, just install Linux on it.

01:36.000 --> 01:42.000
Hey, also with us tonight, say hello to the one and only tech master, Loki, who's joining us.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
Hello.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
And at least he has chicken.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
Yes.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
How you doing, Loki, how are things for you?

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
Doing fine.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
Yeah?

01:49.000 --> 01:53.000
My hands are sticky so I'm trying to figure out how to hold the microphone without, you know.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
Alright, I'll leave you alone so you can finish chicken.

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
It's just a radio program we do pretty consistently every week here at six o'clock.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
You know what? Here's your trivia for the night.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
What's that?

02:01.000 --> 02:06.000
Sticky Fingers, the Rolling Stones album, had a zipper on the thing and also had a guy with a boner on it.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
What?

02:07.000 --> 02:13.000
Seriously, the album, it has like a shot of a guy's crotch and it had a zipper on it where you can unzip the jeans.

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
But the guy had a big boner when they took the picture, so.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
How nice that is.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
And it was Sticky Fingers.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
Right.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
So, there's your trivia.

02:22.000 --> 02:27.000
We're going to get into our gaming weeks, but nobody else in the studio tonight, just the three of us here.

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
You guys, though, are joining us, always the fourth guest with us, our chat room.

02:30.000 --> 02:35.000
Chat.orangelaunchradio.com if you want to chat with us live as you tape live on this Sunday night.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
Just kind of like a live note or whatever.

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
We're really delayed or what have you on the feed.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
I don't know what's up. It's like two to three minutes behind.

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
So, when we say something and when you guys see it.

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
So, you'll have to forgive us a little bit if we're going back to sort.

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
Because we want to make sure the chat has a chance to get feedback on stories.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
We may have to go back a little bit to do that.

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
I don't know why things are so, well, I do know why things are so delayed, but it's nothing we can really fix, sadly.

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
So, we're just going to have to deal with it. Yay!

03:03.000 --> 03:08.000
Anyhow, let's get into our gaming weeks, the types of video games you've been playing this week.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
Always a nice conversation starter.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
Doc Soccer, how was your gaming week?

03:12.000 --> 03:16.000
For the record, I just posted a picture of the album cover with the boner.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
So.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
Thank you.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
I played a little Dragon Age 2.

03:19.000 --> 03:23.000
I am finally into the second act and totally enjoying the game.

03:23.000 --> 03:28.000
I've given up on my lesbian love because Fenris showed up.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
I see.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
Broody elf dude.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
And he's almost like a chick, so that's cool.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
He's a very girly man.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
He whines a lot, so.

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
But at least, like, the dwarf makes fun of him for it.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
And so they just bite back and forth.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
They're so much fun.

03:42.000 --> 03:47.000
Although, although, although I'm still building a little bit of relationship with Meryl, so maybe I'll have them both.

03:47.000 --> 03:51.000
And then I could totally sleep with Isabella anytime I want to because she's a slut.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
Um.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
Then, um.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
I, uh.

03:56.000 --> 04:01.000
We're actually going to be getting back into playing Final Fantasy, Dan and I are, but we did not start yet because he just got back on Wednesday.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
And, um.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
Playing, um.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
World of Warcraft, of course.

04:06.000 --> 04:16.000
And I am almost at exalted with the stupid drunken dwarves and I don't have to do the stupid motion sickness inducing drunken quest again.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
Hopefully soon.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
You know which one I'm talking about, don't you?

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
Where you have to, like, drink ten things of ale and then you get all the fuzzy effects and everything.

04:24.000 --> 04:28.000
And I'm like, motion sick, it makes me want to puke every time I do it.

04:28.000 --> 04:32.000
Yeah, it's, it's pretty, you gotta be careful with that because it even messes me up.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
I still refuse to do the beer run, for the record, because it's fucking annoying.

04:35.000 --> 04:40.000
But I finally got exalted with kitty people and have badass shoes.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
And a camel.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
Oh my god shoes.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
Oh my god shoes.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
And then I got Rebecca Black to twenty.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
Yes, you actually have a character named Rebecca Black.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
Did you roll her on a Friday?

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
Yes I did.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
Yes I did.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
Fun, fun, fun, fun.

04:55.000 --> 04:59.000
She's actually, it turns out, because I made her a human paladin as a joke.

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
And it turns out I really like a human paladin.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
So I've kept the character.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
So, who knew?

05:06.000 --> 05:11.000
And then I always get, you know, people lull when I go into town, so it's funny.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
Done.

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
Alright, Loki, if you're done with your chicken, tell us about your gaming week.

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
Um, I'm gonna play a whole lot.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
Mainly just Grand Theft Auto, as usual.

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
Um, other than Grand Theft Auto, I played a little bit of Game Dev Story.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
Just very briefly.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
Little bit of Rerave.

05:29.000 --> 05:34.000
Um, download the new song packs just for the hell of it.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
And that was kind of fun.

05:36.000 --> 05:45.000
And then, um, actually some excitebots last night, until the Wii broke.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
But it was fun, unless...

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
It'll be fixed soon.

05:48.000 --> 05:53.000
Yeah, you were telling me when you came in here, like, well I broke my Wii last night, and I said, well the good news is it's just a Wii.

05:53.000 --> 05:57.000
Yeah, it's true, and we haven't played that in a long time.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
It's kind of sad though, because I was looking forward to, like, playing some more stuff on there.

06:00.000 --> 06:04.000
But, um, it'll be fixed soon. It's not a big deal.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
It's just inconvenient right now.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
That I have to lose my progress.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
This is only a flesh wound.

06:09.000 --> 06:14.000
Well, we've been so much out of excitebots for the longest time.

06:14.000 --> 06:21.000
I mean, it's kind of a learning curve to get back in and remember, like, how to be so kickass at it.

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
But, it's still fun.

06:24.000 --> 06:30.000
So there's a question for Dark Soccer in our chat room from, and I know this person has this name just to get me to read it.

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
But it's from iFarTed.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
It says, StarSakura question in our chat room.

06:35.000 --> 06:41.000
At chat.orangestonesmedia.com, would you recommend Dragon Age Origins and Dragon Age 2 to someone that's moderately into MMOs?

06:41.000 --> 06:45.000
Well, my answer was, I like DA too. I haven't played DAO, honestly.

06:45.000 --> 06:52.000
Um, I, it doesn't really have a feel of an MMO. It just has a feel of a fun kind of adventure game.

06:52.000 --> 06:56.000
So, I've recommended anybody. It's pretty fun.

06:56.000 --> 07:05.000
I mean, if the type of running around and picking up clues and doing quests in different parts of towns is not your cup of tea, then go get your coffee elsewhere.

07:05.000 --> 07:18.000
And MMOs are so diverse too. Like, it's really hard to say, you know, people that are into WoW may not necessarily be into, I don't know, DC Universe online.

07:18.000 --> 07:22.000
You know, and the people into that might not be into the same, you know, MMOs are a pretty vast market now.

07:22.000 --> 07:29.000
Well, every time I start to get just a little bit bored with Dragon Age 2, one of the characters will say something so hilarious that I keep laughing.

07:29.000 --> 07:37.000
And then I found, um, the, uh, uh, experience cheat. Well, it's more like a glitch in the game where you can get an experience in gold.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
Which really helped. So now I really like the game.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
There you go.

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
Well, I didn't find it. Tiara told me about it, but then I did it by accident.

07:44.000 --> 07:49.000
Because I wasn't really gonna do it, except I managed to get in the right spot, so I was like, maybe I will!

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
Pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop A button.

07:52.000 --> 07:58.000
Um, we also have a blast from the past in our chat room tonight. Check this out, DDR Angel's in chat.

07:58.000 --> 08:02.000
I don't think I've seen her in chat since like episode 130? Maybe? No, it's probably later than that, but still.

08:02.000 --> 08:08.000
Uh, so DDR Angel's in chat saying, you can turn the drunk effect off. I actually never knew that. I don't doubt that that's not true.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
You can set down your graphic settings to do it.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
You, yeah.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
I think.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
There's probably a way you can just go in and turn it off.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
I'm lazy, and honestly...

08:14.000 --> 08:18.000
I never knew either. I just always thought the way to not get the effects to do that, don't drink.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
It's just like real life.

08:19.000 --> 08:23.000
Well, yeah, but you have to drink till you finish the class. You have to drink ten things of ale.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
Oh, yeah. I forgot about that.

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
But you know what? I'll tell you how long it takes me to do the Warhammer crap now.

08:28.000 --> 08:35.000
Wildhammer. No, I was talking about Warhammer because my friend Gary and I were talking and we were talking about how annoying Warhammer is.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
I hate Warhammer. Anyway.

08:37.000 --> 08:43.000
Um, Wildhammer. I can do it in like ten minutes now. It's like super fast and easy.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
Oh, all the dailies?

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
Yeah.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
Yeah.

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
It's like a beer run. Because I hate that one. So I just refuse to do it.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
I hate the Wildhammer quest. But that's a talk for another show.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
Yes.

08:52.000 --> 08:57.000
All right. Sorry, Loki. I don't think you were quite done with your gaming week because I see you've opened up this little...

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
You've opened up your package that you brought with you.

09:00.000 --> 09:08.000
Of course. No, this week as kind of a random thing, we had guests. Celebrity guests at my work.

09:08.000 --> 09:16.000
So out of, I don't know, just trying to be funny, I guess, I had them sign my 360.

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
So I have my JTAG 360, by the way.

09:19.000 --> 09:26.000
I have it signed by Orlando Bloom, Mark Ruffalo, and Christopher...

09:26.000 --> 09:30.000
What was it? I'm trying to remember his last name now.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
That was the lowest build of the three.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
Yeah.

09:33.000 --> 09:37.000
But yeah, it's pretty awesome.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
Oh, Christopher Thornton.

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
It's going up on the OLR thing now.

09:41.000 --> 09:45.000
Yeah, somebody posted the video. We had a little video stumble on our site.

09:45.000 --> 09:52.000
I think somebody found the, one of our authors found the video that you posted on YouTube where you're like, hi.

09:52.000 --> 09:59.000
Well, we have guests here today and I didn't have anything for them to sign. So I brought my Xbox 360.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
I could have used it.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
See if they actually sign it.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
But why do that? That's not as cool.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
And by the way...

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
My favorite is what the guy says. Hold on. I'm just walking up.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
I feel embarrassed.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
It's a hard drive.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
Oh, an Xbox 360.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
I don't have anything to sign other than this, so...

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
That's cool.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
Let's do it, dude.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
I've never signed an Xbox.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
Awesome.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
That's Orlando Bloom, by the way, that doesn't know what the thing is.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
I've never signed an Xbox.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
Yeah.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
Who to?

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
Uh, Matt.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
Matt?

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
Yeah.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
Matt, play hard.

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
That's what he signed it as. Matt, play hard.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
Yeah, that's good.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
That's awesome.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
Thank you, Matt.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
It's poorly filmed because I had to hold the Xbox in.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
Wait, wait. My favorite is the part coming out.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
Nice.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
Is that the one with the blue light?

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
Is that the one with the blue light?

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
No, just DVDs.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
I don't know.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
HD DVDs?

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
Do you think that'll play out?

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
I don't know what it was.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
Aww, actors are real people, too. They don't know what they're...

10:50.000 --> 10:53.000
It's cool. He's busy. I mean, he doesn't have time to play games.

10:53.000 --> 10:57.000
Well, if you like, I have spray fixative.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
So it won't come off.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
I don't think it's gonna come off anyways.

11:01.000 --> 11:04.000
Well, I've had stuff come off of plastic before, so...

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
Wait, but this way.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
Well, don't wash it. You'll be fine.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
I'm not gonna wash it.

11:07.000 --> 11:11.000
No, I have a ton of signed posters and stuff by different celebrities coming in.

11:11.000 --> 11:14.000
Not big celebrities. A couple.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
We've had, like, um...

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
I'm trying to think of some of the people we had.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
Uh...

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
Yeah, none of them are really big celebrities.

11:23.000 --> 11:28.000
But my posters are sitting under a sack of magazines at my desk.

11:28.000 --> 11:32.000
And this goes with me to and from work all the time.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
All the more reason to have some fixative.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
That is a higher honor for them, yeah.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
All the more reason to have some fixative.

11:37.000 --> 11:41.000
Um, I'm moving this week. It's something big I'm doing right now, obviously.

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
And I found some of my autographed pictures.

11:44.000 --> 11:48.000
And one of the autographed pictures I found the other day was the autographed picture of Scott Wolf.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
From Party of Five that you got me.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
That's right. I remember that now.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
Ah, Scott Wolf. He is a tiny...

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
Now he's on V.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
He is so tiny.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
No, but, um...

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
But so dreamy.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
No, they were actually really cool.

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
Because, you know, most of the celebrity guests we have, you know, don't really...

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
They kind of just make their appearance and go.

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
They're just, like, all chilling in the audience with different people.

12:10.000 --> 12:15.000
Um, and just, you know, chatting up people and talking about movies and that kind of stuff.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
So, it was really cool.

12:17.000 --> 12:23.000
It was for a movie called, uh, Sympathy for Delicious, I think is what it was.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
Or something like that.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
Sounds yummy.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
It... It's... It's kind of cool.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
Um...

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
So...

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
Yeah, it was... I don't know. It was just kind of funny.

12:33.000 --> 12:38.000
So this must be worth three million dollars if the Sarah Palin one's worth one million dollars.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
There was a Sarah Palin Xbox worth a million dollars?

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
Well, it's not worth a million dollars.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
It's put up on eBay for a million dollars.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
I see.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
No one's gonna buy it.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
But you're not gonna put this on eBay.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
I'm not gonna put it on eBay.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
You're gonna treasure this forever.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
Yes.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
What did the wife say?

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
She thought it was funny.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
She's like, nerd!

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
Nerd!

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
Alright, anything else for your gaming week?

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
That's it.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
Besides random celebrities signing your Xbox?

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
Actually, you know what my coolest autographs are?

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
Huh?

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
I have three autographed Wil Wheaton books.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
Mm-hmm.

13:05.000 --> 13:09.000
And I have, um, an autographed Jonathan Coulton CD.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
And then I have my Facebook-style photo with him.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
Mm-hmm.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
That he thought was hilarious.

13:13.000 --> 13:17.000
I think my most treasured autograph is my Paula Abdul autograph.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
From the Under My Spell Tour.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
Oh, wow.

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
This is way before she was crazy on pills on American Idol.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
Actually, I take that back.

13:24.000 --> 13:29.000
My greatest, like, legitimate autograph is, um, Yoko Kanno.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
Oh.

13:30.000 --> 13:34.000
Who did Macross Plus and, uh, Escaflowne and all that.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
Mm-hmm.

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
Um, we've got her, uh, signing one of our Macross Plus CDs.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
Well, I'm gonna keep having people sign it.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
To dance on.

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
Are you gonna get more celebrities to sign it?

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
Well, I was intending, I was hoping that they'd sign smaller, but they took up the whole

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
side of three people.

13:48.000 --> 13:51.000
I was gonna say, you should've told Orlando Bloom to write a little fuckin' smaller.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
Like, he took up half the...

13:52.000 --> 13:55.000
That's like that dick that signed the entire page in my yearbook.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
True story.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
This one little jackass.

13:57.000 --> 14:00.000
Kids are such assholes.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
Especially the ones in high school.

14:01.000 --> 14:04.000
This high school jackass signed in my yearbook.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
It took up the entire page.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.000
To Rob.

14:07.000 --> 14:11.000
If you wanna get laid, climb up a chicken's ass and wait.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
Love, asshole.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
But his real name.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
And it took up the entire page.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
What an ass.

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
You should scan that in and post it on his Facebook.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
I don't like I talk to the guy.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
Fuck him.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
Deceasing.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
Anyway.

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
Anyways.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
It's cool.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
I dig it.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
So.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
Alright.

14:31.000 --> 14:36.000
I have to give a public thank you, by the way, to the lovely Marissa for the gift she

14:36.000 --> 14:40.000
sent me of amber oil perfume from Solstice Scents.

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
Very nice of her.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.000
It smells pretty.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
It smells like amber.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
Alright.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
My gaming week.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
I gotta be honest.

14:49.000 --> 14:52.000
I've been moving, so I haven't had a lot in my gaming week, and I hate coming on here

14:52.000 --> 14:55.000
on the show and saying, yeah, I have a video game podcast, so I haven't really been playing

14:55.000 --> 14:56.000
any video games.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
But I think I have a pretty legitimate excuse.

14:58.000 --> 15:04.000
I watched Alan play the Mortal Kombat demo, and, you know, nothing new there, although,

15:04.000 --> 15:09.000
you know, I keep laughing at the horrible, horrible Molina fatality, because it's funny.

15:09.000 --> 15:13.000
And then he was playing some other game, too, and you know this game, Dark Soccer, the minute

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
I say it, it's the Strider dude did this on PlayStation 3.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
Moon Diver.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
Moon Diver.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
I've got it.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
I watched him play that.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
Super cool.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
And I was, it's so funny, because he fired it up.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
I didn't know what it was.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
He's like, oh, it's Moon Diver.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
And I'm like, this fucking looks like Strider.

15:26.000 --> 15:30.000
And then I thought, I'm like, oh, this must be the game that Jamie was telling me about

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
that it's by the guy who did Strider.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
Yeah, it's on PlayStation Network for like 15 bucks.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
Yeah.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
It's kind of one of those things, I bet a lot of people don't know it's out there, but

15:37.000 --> 15:40.000
if you like Strider, to be fair, I didn't play it.

15:40.000 --> 15:44.000
I just watched Alan play it, because literally, that was about all the gaming I did this week.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
But I was like, wow, this looks just like Strider.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
I should check this out.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
But it's four players simultaneous.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
Yes.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
So I would love to do a full four player game on that.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
I bet it's a lot of fun.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
Lots of little sword.

15:56.000 --> 16:00.000
But the thing I don't get is like in every one of his games in Japanese versions, you

16:00.000 --> 16:04.000
get ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha every time the guy slashes his sword.

16:04.000 --> 16:07.000
So I'm like, they took that out for the American Strider.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
Oh, that's good.

16:08.000 --> 16:12.000
Because he'd just go ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha the whole time.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
But anyway.

16:13.000 --> 16:17.000
Alright, going to our chat room with some comments on our gaming weeks.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
Chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

16:18.000 --> 16:22.000
Bobby Blackwolf wants to know, how many autographs has OLR signed for others?

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
That's a good question.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
One or two.

16:25.000 --> 16:33.000
We had one of the in the groove discs that we gave away that remember we fucked up the

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
cover of it.

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
The turbo graphics, I think there was something we signed, right?

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
Yeah.

16:38.000 --> 16:44.000
Oh, we sent the turbo graphics to the winner and we all signed it in silver paint pen.

16:44.000 --> 16:49.000
And there was, I think we sent like a thank you note or something to somebody who did

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
something for us and we included the ferret.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
I remember that.

16:52.000 --> 16:55.000
I got, I got pulled aside at Fonomy.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
Remember the last time I went?

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
To sign somebody's like costume prop.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
Like, okay.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
I might have signed one thing at PAX East.

17:03.000 --> 17:06.000
You didn't give away the orange bat or something like that.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
No.

17:07.000 --> 17:11.000
We had, we did a new orange bat and gave that away.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
Yes.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
Because the original orange bat's in the closet behind you.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
It's in the closet.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
Yeah.

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
I don't have delusions that were like actually famous or whatever, but once in a while.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
I do.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
I'm delusional enough for all of us.

17:21.000 --> 17:24.000
A random listener I just run into in an event.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
Of course.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
I have another autograph.

17:26.000 --> 17:30.000
I have an autograph screener from Rob Schneider, which is kind of odd.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
He is, he is also very short.

17:32.000 --> 17:35.000
A lot of actors, very short.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
None of those people, not short.

17:37.000 --> 17:40.000
God, I can't remember any actors' names today.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
What the hell is wrong with me?

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
What was he in?

17:42.000 --> 17:43.000
What'd he do?

17:43.000 --> 17:44.000
Jurassic Park.

17:44.000 --> 17:48.000
He's now in Law and Order, Criminal Intent.

17:48.000 --> 17:52.000
Earth Girls Are Easy.

17:52.000 --> 17:56.000
Blank, blank, blank.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.000
Independence Day.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
Blank.

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
Was it the dude that played the old guy?

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
No, not the old guy.

18:03.000 --> 18:07.000
He was the smart guy who figured out the pattern.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.000
Oh.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
Oh, I know.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
Jeff Goldblum?

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
Yes, Jeff Goldblum.

18:11.000 --> 18:16.000
I had Jeff Goldblum's autograph, and I such, I missed out on such an opportunity.

18:16.000 --> 18:22.000
I actually had from some random lots of records I bought, the soundtrack of Earth Girls Are

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
Easy on vinyl.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
I could have had him sign it.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
I was like, ugh.

18:26.000 --> 18:29.000
That would have been hilarious.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
He probably would have laughed.

18:31.000 --> 18:34.000
He probably would have thought that was really funny.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
I'm trying to think of some of the other ones.

18:36.000 --> 18:42.000
We've had the son of the guy from on Three's Company.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
John Ritter's son?

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
Yeah, Jason Ritter.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.000
He came out.

18:46.000 --> 18:50.000
He was pretty cool.

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
Just a lot of people.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
That guy from Fargo.

18:53.000 --> 18:57.000
Now, when I worked at GNC, I met a lot of famous people, like the remaining members

18:57.000 --> 19:00.000
of Sublime, and a bunch of wrestlers.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
Well, we're going to get into video game chat, right?

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
Yeah.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
Hollywood chat.

19:04.000 --> 19:08.000
Gene Siskel out before he had his whole cancer thing.

19:08.000 --> 19:12.000
Just a couple quick comments from chat, because again, they're behind a little bit.

19:12.000 --> 19:15.000
TigerKlaas says, Loki, you better cherish that 360 for as long as you can, because soon

19:15.000 --> 19:19.000
you will see Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner and the Hulk in the Avengers movie.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
That's right, I forgot about that.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
Oh, awesome.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
He's going to be big time soon.

19:24.000 --> 19:33.000
I mean, he directed this movie, the movie that he came in to promote, and it was him

19:33.000 --> 19:40.000
and the Christopher Thornton, because they were kind of roommates and stuff, and Christopher

19:40.000 --> 19:46.000
Thornton, he got in an accident, like a climbing accident, where he became paralyzed, and this

19:46.000 --> 19:50.000
was kind of all about him and learning to deal with that.

19:50.000 --> 19:56.000
And the movie's about him realizing he has the gift of healing, kind of like one of those

19:56.000 --> 20:01.000
spiritual healers or something like that, and what he ends up doing with it, and it's

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
kind of interesting.

20:03.000 --> 20:06.000
More comments from our chatroom at chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

20:06.000 --> 20:11.000
Who was saying about the DSI was Defective Candy said, my greatest autograph is my DSI

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
signed by Nobuo Uematsu.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
That's a pretty good one, too.

20:14.000 --> 20:18.000
Oh, I know who else I have that actually made me super giddy to get.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
Koji Kondo.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
Ah, there you go.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
When he was doing the Wii Orchestra thing.

20:22.000 --> 20:26.000
And sj100matt says, I signed a shoe for Electric Sisterhood at PAX East.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
See, I don't even remember that.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.000
I was drunk.

20:28.000 --> 20:31.000
That's what I always say when I don't remember something that probably happened.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
I was drunk.

20:32.000 --> 20:35.000
Hey, I remember where one of the other ferrets went.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
I actually found one when I was moving.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
You did?

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
You didn't bring it?

20:39.000 --> 20:40.000
No.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.000
I'll bring it.

20:41.000 --> 20:44.000
Remember when one of the other ferrets got attached to the Katamari ball?

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
That's right.

20:45.000 --> 20:46.000
At E3 one year.

20:46.000 --> 20:49.000
Alright, enough reminiscing, enough Hollywood chat.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
Let's get into a little bit of housekeeping.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
No show next week.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
We will not be here live next week.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.000
I gotta watch the kitty.

20:54.000 --> 20:57.000
Loki and myself have some other things we have to take care of.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
Dark Sakura would be a one-woman show otherwise.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
And I don't think anyone wants to be subjected to that.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
Oh, I could totally go live.

21:03.000 --> 21:07.000
It's gonna be called Bitches Listen.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
That's what my new show's gonna be called.

21:08.000 --> 21:11.000
Wouldn't it be Listen to Bitches?

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
Hee hee.

21:12.000 --> 21:15.000
Rob, you see what our listeners can't see?

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
Heart!

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
Only half of one.

21:18.000 --> 21:21.000
So yeah, we won't be here next week, but we'll be back in two weeks.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
So bear with us.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
Yep, that's really it.

21:24.000 --> 21:29.000
Otherwise, visit our website at orangelaunchradio.com, our Facebook at facebook.com slash orangelaunchradio,

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000

21:31.000 --> 21:32.000
We're on all those sites.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
All the social networking stuff.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
Alright, let's get into some actual gaming news.

21:35.000 --> 21:38.000
I don't know, it felt like after last week, this is kind of a slow news week, but there's

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
been some things worth mentioning.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
A few things.

21:42.000 --> 21:49.000
So, of course, it's coming out now, reports of just how well the 3DS sold in different

21:49.000 --> 21:56.000
regions, and it says, you know, Nintendo said 1.5 million of the 4 million shipped handhelds

21:56.000 --> 22:00.000
were headed for Japan by the end of March.

22:00.000 --> 22:06.000
And I guess, according to the Japanese sales tracker, kind of like the MPD group over here,

22:06.000 --> 22:09.000
Mediacrate, there are still plenty of leftovers.

22:09.000 --> 22:15.000
They're saying that they've only sold about 836,000 units, meaning that they're still

22:15.000 --> 22:24.000
unbroken the 1 million mark in Japan, and still have about 664,000 units left.

22:24.000 --> 22:33.000
Yeah, I know from purchasing my Japanese system originally, yeah, it was pretty easy to get.

22:33.000 --> 22:36.000
It was not, there were not shortages on this stuff.

22:36.000 --> 22:44.000
Now, I don't know, for me, I think under a million units at launch is kind of, for

22:44.000 --> 22:45.000
Nintendo, isn't good.

22:45.000 --> 22:50.000
I mean, it's, you would kind of expect them to sell well with their handhelds, because

22:50.000 --> 22:53.000
I mean, they have a pretty good market share over there, and people are kind of gung-ho

22:53.000 --> 22:58.000
about that stuff, but I really think what hurt them was the lack of, you know, must

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
have titles at launch.

23:00.000 --> 23:05.000
Well, could it also be, I don't know, the earthquake and the tsunamis making people

23:05.000 --> 23:09.000
think of other things over there than, you know, just 3D stuff?

23:09.000 --> 23:13.000
Yeah, okay, but the earthquake stuff happened, what, a couple weeks ago?

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
Is that right?

23:14.000 --> 23:18.000
Yeah, I mean, okay, I get it, but, you know, there might have been some people that were

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
waiting a little bit, I don't know.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
Uh, no.

23:21.000 --> 23:24.000
You can't deny that cut into sales, potential sales.

23:24.000 --> 23:29.000
I mean, okay, yeah, I mean, the launch day should have probably been bigger, but, you

23:29.000 --> 23:33.000
know, the month totals are smaller because of the tragedy.

23:33.000 --> 23:40.000
Okay, well that's fine, I'll give you that, but I guarantee, and, you know, it's not gonna

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
catch up as quickly.

23:41.000 --> 23:48.000
I think what the thing is, is it's not enough, I mean, the 3D, and from what I've found,

23:48.000 --> 23:54.000
just playing stuff, the 3D's cool, but there's no real must-have titles yet.

23:54.000 --> 23:57.000
I mean, like the stuff I bought, like Pilot Wings and Ridge Racer, it's kind of like,

23:57.000 --> 24:00.000
okay, out of the stuff that's coming out, this is what I kind of think are the best

24:00.000 --> 24:04.000
ones, you know, and that's it, it's not like, oh my god, I've got to have Ridge Racer

24:04.000 --> 24:08.000
again, or oh my god, I've got to have Pilot Wings, it was just kind of, eh, okay, well,

24:08.000 --> 24:11.000
this is what I've got to choose from, so I'm gonna pick this.

24:11.000 --> 24:17.000
I don't think anyone's really super excited about a new Nintendogs, I mean, or Steel Diver.

24:17.000 --> 24:21.000
That's true, I mean, it definitely hurt them to not have a Mario game, or a Zelda game,

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
or hell, the Kid Icarus game at launch.

24:23.000 --> 24:28.000
Or a new IP, for god's sake, I mean, you know, how about let's create something new?

24:28.000 --> 24:35.000
Well, Steel Diver, which I hear is kind of not all of that, but they definitely, you

24:35.000 --> 24:40.000
know, somebody at Nintendo feels like it's a thing, so you know, there's that, that's

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
new.

24:41.000 --> 24:47.000
Yeah, but it's not something that they're really promoting, it's not like, you know,

24:47.000 --> 24:51.000
a Kirby or Mario or something like that, it's just a game that they put out.

24:51.000 --> 24:54.000
The Wii had the Zelda game, which was like a must-have, I mean, it was just a great game.

24:54.000 --> 24:59.000
The Nintendo 64 had Mario 64, which many will argue is one of the greatest games of all

24:59.000 --> 25:00.000
time, period.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.000
Right?

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
Mario 64 was a launch game?

25:02.000 --> 25:03.000
Yeah.

25:03.000 --> 25:04.000
I think, yeah.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
GameCube, I don't recall having anything big.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
I think it had, what, Luigi's Mansion.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
Yeah, Luigi's Mansion was the big one.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
Well, the first one, I guess.

25:12.000 --> 25:16.000
So, but the GameCube also was challenged with sales to some regards, so.

25:16.000 --> 25:23.000
And then I remember Mario 64 for the DS, and you know, Super Mario World for the Super

25:23.000 --> 25:26.000
Nintendo, and you know, Mario Brothers for the Nintendo.

25:26.000 --> 25:29.000
So, it's just, I don't know.

25:29.000 --> 25:33.000
And then also, once again, you know, people are kind of looking at the 3D as kind of gimmicky,

25:33.000 --> 25:40.000
and also knowing, you know, their track record with just, not even really peripherals with

25:40.000 --> 25:43.000
like, their hardware, it's like, eh, well, you know what?

25:43.000 --> 25:46.000
I'm not gonna buy one right away, because I know in like, a few months they're gonna

25:46.000 --> 25:49.000
announce that they're gonna have a slimmer one, they're gonna mark this down or something

25:49.000 --> 25:54.000
like that, or they're gonna add something or tweak something, and I don't really wanna

25:54.000 --> 26:00.000
wait, or I'm gonna wait for, you know, a new stuff to come out.

26:00.000 --> 26:03.000
Or, you know, for the actual good games to come out.

26:03.000 --> 26:08.000
Just real quick, the GameCube launched with 12 games, and some of the highlights of those

26:08.000 --> 26:15.000
12 games of what came out, Luigi's Mansion, Madden NFL 2002, Star Wars Rogue Squadron 2,

26:15.000 --> 26:19.000
Rogue Leader, I remember that being a really cool game, Super Monkey Ball, and Wave Race

26:19.000 --> 26:24.000
Bluestorm was probably, and see, see, there's nothing in there save maybe the Star Wars

26:24.000 --> 26:28.000
game and maybe Luigi's Mansion or Wave Race, there's nothing that really like, jumps at

26:28.000 --> 26:29.000
you, right?

26:29.000 --> 26:34.000
But the GameCube, of course, was also pegged for not selling nearly as well as the 64 had.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.000
So.

26:35.000 --> 26:36.000
Yeah.

26:36.000 --> 26:39.000
Maybe launch titles are way more important.

26:39.000 --> 26:43.000
But I don't know, like, is the launch that important?

26:43.000 --> 26:47.000
See, I sort of see this as Nintendo trying to set the stage for the holidays.

26:47.000 --> 26:51.000
I don't think Nintendo is really concerned with how this thing sells until the holidays.

26:51.000 --> 26:56.000
Yeah, I think that's correct, but at the same time, though, they've got to try to get

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
people, I mean, they don't want it to fail at any part.

26:58.000 --> 27:03.000
You know, they may not be as concerned with the numbers not being quite where they want

27:03.000 --> 27:07.000
them to be, but it is saying something, though, when your system's not selling out.

27:07.000 --> 27:11.000
And it's not necessarily a bad thing, because it's good that people can find it when they

27:11.000 --> 27:12.000
want it.

27:12.000 --> 27:16.000
It's not like the WiiWare, it's just impossible to find.

27:16.000 --> 27:21.000
But, it's, at the same time, it's, you look at what their release schedule is for the

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
3DS stuff, there's not a lot coming out.

27:23.000 --> 27:30.000
I mean, it's pretty slim pickins for forever right now, because they haven't really announced

27:30.000 --> 27:31.000
a lot of stuff.

27:31.000 --> 27:35.000
Okay, both GameGuru and Act F'd in our chatroom were chiming in saying Super Smash Brothers

27:35.000 --> 27:38.000
Melee was about three months after their release.

27:38.000 --> 27:43.000
Well, but, that's, three months later is still three months later, and, you know, who's to

27:43.000 --> 27:46.000
say we're not going to get some of these big 3DS games three months later?

27:46.000 --> 27:50.000
We're not, because they've already announced what the launch window stuff is, and that's

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
from Launch Window.

27:52.000 --> 27:53.000
I love that, Launch Window.

27:53.000 --> 27:58.000
I'm sorry, Launch Window may be the week that it comes out, or maybe the day it comes out.

27:58.000 --> 27:59.000
Not three months.

27:59.000 --> 28:03.000
I don't call, you know, if you want to use that, let's say, okay, well, Xbox 360's had

28:03.000 --> 28:08.000
a really awesome launch window this past five years, or six years.

28:08.000 --> 28:09.000
Yeah.

28:09.000 --> 28:13.000
I really think you can't really judge this thing until the holidays, because I think,

28:13.000 --> 28:16.000
you know, the Kid Icarus will obviously be out by the holidays.

28:16.000 --> 28:17.000
It better be.

28:17.000 --> 28:20.000
I think Nintendo's going to have that stealth title that comes out at E3, which I don't

28:20.000 --> 28:21.000
think is very stealth at all.

28:21.000 --> 28:25.000
I'm pretty sure it's going to be Mario Brothers on the 3DS, and I think that'll be out by

28:25.000 --> 28:26.000
the holidays.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
That'll be New Super Mario Brothers 2, or something.

28:28.000 --> 28:31.000
New Super Mario Brothers 3D, or something, you know.

28:31.000 --> 28:34.000
That'll be their big thing that they come out and announce at the very end that's playable

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
on the show floor, because it's coming out this holiday.

28:36.000 --> 28:37.000
They have some good stuff.

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
I mean, they have, like, well, actually...

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
And that thing's going to sell a shit ton of 3Ds.

28:41.000 --> 28:45.000
And then by that time, you're going to be having 3D Netflix, you're going to be, you

28:45.000 --> 28:48.000
know, I really think it's just so early to tell.

28:48.000 --> 28:56.000
I don't think this system was really designed to have a huge launch.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.000
So.

28:57.000 --> 28:58.000
We'll see.

28:58.000 --> 28:59.000
We'll see.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.000
Absolutely.

29:00.000 --> 29:01.000
All right.

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
Moving on to some more news.

29:03.000 --> 29:06.000
This also has to do with handhelds and the tragedy and possibly the impact it had with

29:06.000 --> 29:07.000
it.

29:07.000 --> 29:08.000
The NGP.

29:08.000 --> 29:12.000
Now, there's been a lot of back and forth with this this week, so hear me out here.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
The NGP might...

29:14.000 --> 29:18.000
They were saying earlier in the week it might not have happened this year because of the

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
big earthquake that happened.

29:20.000 --> 29:25.000
And there was a report where Jack Trenton, who is the Sony Computer Entertainment America

29:25.000 --> 29:30.000
president talking to Bloomberg saying that Sony may have to launch the next generation

29:30.000 --> 29:34.000
portable in just one market by the end of the year, which, you know, originally they

29:34.000 --> 29:35.000
were going to be doing it everywhere.

29:35.000 --> 29:38.000
And, of course, a lot of people said, well, that makes sense.

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
You know, it's really unfortunate what happened.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
But yeah, that would probably be the case.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
But then it came out a little later in the week.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
Wait a minute.

29:46.000 --> 29:51.000
Jack Trenton actually said they may have to delay the release of the next generation portable.

29:51.000 --> 29:59.000
And the bosses in Japan, namely Satoshi Furuka, who is the representative of Sony Computer

29:59.000 --> 30:04.000
Entertainment over in Japan, said, so far we see no impact from the quake on our launch

30:04.000 --> 30:08.000
plan, saying that the original Bloomberg report was wrong.

30:08.000 --> 30:09.000
Period.

30:09.000 --> 30:13.000
So, it may not be delayed after all.

30:13.000 --> 30:16.000
Of course, this is one of those things where it's like, well, you don't really know until

30:16.000 --> 30:17.000
E3.

30:17.000 --> 30:22.000
So, if Sony products in the past or any history, it'll be out in Japan, then it'll be out in

30:22.000 --> 30:23.000
the U.S. and Europe.

30:23.000 --> 30:26.000
So, you're going to see some bit of a delay.

30:26.000 --> 30:32.000
But, you know, I think you're going to see something where it comes out in Japan September,

30:32.000 --> 30:36.000
October, and it comes out in the U.S. and Europe just in time for Black Friday here

30:36.000 --> 30:39.000
in the U.S., like last week of November-ish.

30:39.000 --> 30:40.000
Sounds likely.

30:40.000 --> 30:45.000
And by, you know, putting out rumors of delay, it probably just raised a little bit more

30:45.000 --> 30:46.000
of the want.

30:46.000 --> 30:50.000
So, I still feel like that we don't know enough about really what the system is going to bring

30:50.000 --> 30:51.000
to the table.

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
Yes, we had the press event before.

30:53.000 --> 30:56.000
But, you know, a lot of stuff changes, too.

30:56.000 --> 31:01.000
You know, and a lot of times, the things that they advertise don't really make the launch,

31:01.000 --> 31:02.000
right?

31:02.000 --> 31:05.000
Going back into our last story a little bit, eh?

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
So, anyhow.

31:07.000 --> 31:13.000
But with the PSP, though, I don't think there's really anything they announced that didn't

31:13.000 --> 31:14.000
make the launch.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
They just added stuff later on.

31:16.000 --> 31:22.000
Whereas Nintendo, oh yeah, all this stuff is, you know, going to be there.

31:22.000 --> 31:25.000
Oh yeah, but it's going to be, don't worry, it's coming out in the launch window.

31:25.000 --> 31:26.000
It won't be long.

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
It'll just be a couple months.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
Launch window, my ass.

31:30.000 --> 31:31.000
Come on.

31:31.000 --> 31:32.000
Just say, listen, okay?

31:32.000 --> 31:33.000
We put this out.

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
We wanted to get this out earlier.

31:35.000 --> 31:38.000
You know, some of this stuff's not done, so.

31:38.000 --> 31:41.000
Still a lot of DS chitter chatter in our chat room.

31:41.000 --> 31:44.000
ActDef saying the DS launch titles were pretty bad, too.

31:44.000 --> 31:49.000
There were some pretty bad games at launch, but it also had the Mario 64 conversion, which

31:49.000 --> 31:53.000
had a lot of people excited, because, you know, they had changed a few things with it,

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
made the extra characters or something.

31:55.000 --> 32:00.000
So, I still remember Mario 64 being a pretty big deal when that first came out on the DS.

32:00.000 --> 32:04.000
SSG100Matt says, there needs to be a buzz for when they go into the holidays.

32:04.000 --> 32:08.000
If there is no buzz for it, then kids won't be begging their parents to buy it for them.

32:08.000 --> 32:09.000
That's right.

32:09.000 --> 32:13.000
UnfoldedRaptor says, what about Super Mario Sunshine or Star Fox Adventures?

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
Again, both those games came way later, didn't they?

32:15.000 --> 32:16.000
Yeah.

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
Especially Mario Sunshine was way later.

32:18.000 --> 32:19.000
That was at least a year after.

32:19.000 --> 32:20.000
So, those aren't even, you know.

32:20.000 --> 32:23.000
And Star Fox Adventures, I think people like to forget about.

32:23.000 --> 32:26.000
Yeah, I don't think that was considered a big hit.

32:26.000 --> 32:31.000
DDRAngel saying, I can't remember if Animal Crossing was a late release or not.

32:31.000 --> 32:32.000
It was.

32:32.000 --> 32:33.000
Yeah.

32:33.000 --> 32:34.000
I don't know if it was late, but it was more like mid.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
It definitely wasn't early.

32:36.000 --> 32:41.000
GameGuru says, besides the PlayStation 2's big title, Grand Theft Auto 3 came out a year

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
after the PlayStation 2's launch.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
Here's the thing, though.

32:45.000 --> 32:49.000
The PlayStation 2 had a way different thing going for it at the time.

32:49.000 --> 32:52.000
And the big thing was, it was a DVD player.

32:52.000 --> 32:55.000
And that was right at the time when DVDs were starting to crack.

32:55.000 --> 33:03.000
And a lot of people were buying PlayStation 2s because, hey, it plays DVDs and it can play games.

33:03.000 --> 33:06.000
It's the same thing that Sony was hoping would sell the PlayStation 3.

33:06.000 --> 33:09.000
It plays Blu-rays and games.

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
And, you know, now it's all about this.

33:11.000 --> 33:14.000
It plays 3D Blu-rays as well.

33:14.000 --> 33:17.000
In fact, you know, I don't know how many of you ran out and got Tron this week,

33:17.000 --> 33:20.000
but some of the box sets, they have stickers right on them.

33:20.000 --> 33:23.000
Blu-ray also plays on PlayStation 3.

33:23.000 --> 33:27.000
And it says right there on the back, to watch a Blu-ray 3D movie,

33:27.000 --> 33:31.000
you will need a Blu-ray 3D player or a PlayStation 3.

33:31.000 --> 33:36.000
So, you know, they're really setting up a PlayStation 3 as, like, you know, not just a game machine.

33:36.000 --> 33:40.000
And that was the same deal with the PlayStation 2 and why it sold very well.

33:40.000 --> 33:46.000
And it is a really good Blu-ray player because it's one that keeps itself up to date with, you know, over the networks.

33:46.000 --> 33:49.000
And, yeah, you can with normal, like, Blu-ray players as well,

33:49.000 --> 33:52.000
but it's a little more cumbersome than just an automatic update.

33:52.000 --> 33:57.000
I don't know, it's just, it's good for that.

33:57.000 --> 34:01.000
I mean, I use it for a Blu-ray player more than I use it for a game system.

34:01.000 --> 34:06.000
Remember all the shit that people gave Xbox to when it came out because it did not play DVDs?

34:06.000 --> 34:11.000
Unless you bought a $50 remote, the DVD playback kit.

34:11.000 --> 34:12.000
Yeah.

34:12.000 --> 34:13.000
Yeah.

34:13.000 --> 34:17.000
I think a lot of people forgot how horrible that went over.

34:17.000 --> 34:20.000
Anyhow, let's move on with some more gaming news.

34:20.000 --> 34:21.000
Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
I'm completely mesmerized by the sexiness.

34:23.000 --> 34:24.000
What's that?

34:24.000 --> 34:29.000
Well, it's a game coming out called Galaga Legion's DX.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
Ooh, I want to take a look at this too.

34:31.000 --> 34:32.000
Uh, they-

34:32.000 --> 34:36.000
Are you playing the video?

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
Yes, I'm looking at the video too. I want to see this here.

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
Ah, pretty.

34:40.000 --> 34:48.000
It's basically, um, tons and tons and tons of the, the Galaga Armada going against you.

34:48.000 --> 34:51.000
You have to shoot lots and lots and lots and lots of them.

34:51.000 --> 34:54.000
This isn't bullet hell, this is ship hell.

34:54.000 --> 34:58.000
And it's done by the same, uh, people who did Pac-Man Championship Edition.

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
So, very cool.

35:00.000 --> 35:07.000
It's got a new feature called Focus Fire, where it gives you, um, control for secondary aiming.

35:07.000 --> 35:10.000
And, uh, it looks like it's pretty awesome.

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
It's got lots of pretty colors and swirlies and things.

35:12.000 --> 35:20.000
Yeah, it almost looks like it's like, I don't know, like, Galaga meets Geometry Wars meets-

35:20.000 --> 35:23.000
Res or some type of Q Entertainment game?

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
Is pretty.

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
Do want.

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
There's the Focus Fire option.

35:29.000 --> 35:30.000
Interesting.

35:30.000 --> 35:35.000
But it looks like one of the things is you sort of cut through them like you're making a path.

35:35.000 --> 35:42.000
And then can, uh, sort of send out something that would destroy, like, them en masse.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
So it looks pretty cool.

35:44.000 --> 35:45.000
Very neat.

35:45.000 --> 35:49.000
And I can, um, link the, uh, YouTube video in the chatroom.

35:49.000 --> 35:50.000
Very cool.

35:50.000 --> 35:55.000
I'm glad to see the Pac-Man Championship Edition team is kind of continuing forward with reimagining some other titles.

35:55.000 --> 36:00.000
This looks a little weird, but I would definitely check out, you know, like a demo at least to see if it's something I would be into.

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
But, you know, I love Pac-Man Championship Edition.

36:02.000 --> 36:05.000
And even the reimagined one, you know, they put out the second one not that long ago.

36:05.000 --> 36:06.000
It's great too.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
So, uh, that's a good team.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
Reimagining some of the classics.

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
I wonder what other Namco classics they should revisit.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
I think we should get, like, Dig Dug Hardcore.

36:14.000 --> 36:17.000
Ah, that would be crazy.

36:17.000 --> 36:21.000
I don't even know how that would work, but it just, in my head, it's really funny.

36:21.000 --> 36:29.000
But it also looks like you get another one where you can get all sorts of, uh, you know how you can get your bonus ship when it takes the ship and you free it?

36:29.000 --> 36:30.000
Mm-hmm.

36:30.000 --> 36:34.000
It looks like you have an option similar to that, except it's got a bunch of bonus ships.

36:34.000 --> 36:39.000
So, but it's gonna be, um, on Xbox 360 and PS3.

36:39.000 --> 36:40.000
Of course.

36:40.000 --> 36:41.000
Alright. Awesome.

36:41.000 --> 36:42.000
Let's move on.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.000
Loki.

36:43.000 --> 36:44.000
Yeah.

36:44.000 --> 36:52.000
Um, so there's, uh, some new announcements made by EA regarding their, uh, basketball franchises.

36:52.000 --> 37:02.000
You may remember NBA Elite 11, uh, got cancelled last year, uh, when it was apparently revealed that it's crap.

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
Um, so they didn't release it.

37:04.000 --> 37:07.000
Well, a few leaked out, but they didn't release it.

37:07.000 --> 37:11.000
Um, well, the next simulation basketball game won't be coming this year.

37:11.000 --> 37:18.000
It'll actually be next year, um, in fall of 2012 is when you can expect the next EA game.

37:18.000 --> 37:21.000
They're really going back to the drawing board with that stuff.

37:21.000 --> 37:28.000
So, um, they're saying, you know, we have top talent on the game and we're giving the new development team time to deliver a superior experience.

37:28.000 --> 37:33.000
We're making great strides and looking forward to launching a new game next year.

37:33.000 --> 37:43.000
And it says, uh, that lesson's, uh, that lesson about giving the team plenty of time was learned the hard way through the near release and scrapping of NBA 11.

37:43.000 --> 37:58.000
And then, of course, uh, to fill the void for not having a new NBA, you know, simulation game, there is the NBA Jam On Fire edition that's coming to PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade this October.

37:58.000 --> 38:04.000
And apparently it is a follow-up, of course, to NBA Jam that was released last year.

38:04.000 --> 38:13.000
Um, and then it's going download only just like it was originally supposed to, uh, with the release of NBA Elite 11.

38:13.000 --> 38:17.000
It was supposed to be a pack-in bonus, I guess, if you bought the game.

38:17.000 --> 38:31.000
The On Fire edition will be getting, uh, new opponent AI, uh, revamped visuals, and I guess a host of new online features as well as an online, uh, road trip campaign mode and roster updates.

38:31.000 --> 38:38.000
And, um, apparently the new AI's, um, gonna learn your tendencies and throw them back in your face.

38:38.000 --> 38:48.000
And, uh, apparently the game will be $15 to $20, not $50 like it was released last year.

38:48.000 --> 38:53.000
And really, if you ask me, it was way too expensive for a game that was originally gonna be free.

38:53.000 --> 39:03.000
Exactly. And that, I didn't even really think of this in terms of, oh, EA needs a basketball game this year since their other one's gonna get delayed till next year.

39:03.000 --> 39:15.000
Um, now I always thought this was kind of like, oh, I guess NBA Jam didn't really do well, so this is their way to try to make money from it by delivering it the way everybody said they thought it should have been in the first place.

39:15.000 --> 39:26.000
It's very interesting because this whole value of a game thing has been a big theme the past year or so, you know, or at least especially since Game Developers Conference this year where they were, you know, talking about it.

39:26.000 --> 39:36.000
Uh, you know, when they were kind of getting into that whole argument about, um, the Angry Birds developer sells their game for 99 cents, Nintendo says it devalues games as a whole, blah, blah, blah, blah.

39:36.000 --> 39:47.000
It's very interesting where the public is kind of setting the bar for some things. Like, you talk to a lot of people and everybody's like, $50, $60, way too much to pay for NBA Jam, but I pay $15 for it.

39:47.000 --> 39:50.000
It's like, how do you value a game? How do you price a game?

39:50.000 --> 39:58.000
I think the reason why that they're willing to pay $15 or $20 for the game is because it was originally announced that it was going to be an Xbox Live Arcade game.

39:58.000 --> 40:14.000
So, what that sounds like when, you know, the consumer hears, okay, it was going to be a packing game that was going to be released on Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network later on after NBA Elite comes out and you can purchase that separately if you didn't buy NBA Elite, you know, for $15 to $20.

40:14.000 --> 40:21.000
Oh, but now NBA Elite gets cancelled and now it's a $50 game because they're claiming that they added some other stuff in.

40:21.000 --> 40:34.000
Well, I'm sorry, but what did they add in that raised the price up $30? Because I can tell you this much, I've seen the Xbox Live Arcade game, back out on PartnerNet, and they didn't add much.

40:34.000 --> 40:47.000
Definitely not $30 much. So, that's a load of bullshit right there and the fact that they're now re- I would call it a re-release, okay, so they're tweaking it a little bit and then selling it to you again.

40:47.000 --> 40:56.000
Well, if you think about it, that is EA for you. They tweak things a little bit and then they sell it to you again. That's their sports games franchises.

40:56.000 --> 41:04.000
I mean, I don't know, it's whatever. I mean, if you're going to buy it, cool. Honestly, last NBA Jam game didn't look that great.

41:04.000 --> 41:11.000
I mean, it looked all- I guess it was alright, but I did without it and I can do without this next one.

41:11.000 --> 41:18.000
But, good news I guess for 2K, at least they get another year where they have no competition whatsoever.

41:18.000 --> 41:28.000
And there's other developers out there that are kind of taking the whole pricing structure thing and turning it on its nose, like THQ is trying with MX vs ATV Alive.

41:28.000 --> 41:32.000
They're putting out the game for $40 new and then they're going to support it with download content.

41:32.000 --> 41:41.000
And they're saying that's the way they're going to do things. They're going to keep adding download content on a regular basis and then make additional money that way.

41:41.000 --> 41:48.000
Which is fine as long as it's actually new content and not just crap that they're just removed out of the game and then added back in later on.

41:48.000 --> 41:52.000
Or like, God, I can't wait for that role-playing game to come out that costs $40.

41:52.000 --> 41:58.000
But to beat the final boss, you need the final boss pack, which you can download for $20 on Xbox Live.

41:58.000 --> 42:02.000
Or to finish the story, you need the epilogue pack. You know what I mean?

42:02.000 --> 42:03.000
Yeah.

42:03.000 --> 42:11.000
I'd be a little worried about that. Alright, we'll see what happens when this game's released. If it goes over as well as everybody thinks, it will.

42:11.000 --> 42:16.000
Anyhow, moving on to news about Sonic the Hedgehog.

42:16.000 --> 42:21.000
Apparently, there is a new Sonic the Hedgehog game on its way out. It's coming out for the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3.

42:21.000 --> 42:24.000
This was announced via Sonic's Facebook page.

42:24.000 --> 42:30.000
There was a little teaser trailer released where Sonic is running through little colored sequences of loops and so forth.

42:30.000 --> 42:36.000
Classic Sonic is back in the game. Let's take a look. Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in 2011.

42:36.000 --> 42:42.000
Taking a look here at the, excuse me, the little teaser video here in studio.

42:42.000 --> 42:45.000
Let's see if we can get it to load.

42:45.000 --> 42:46.000
Sega!

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
Of course. Every Sega game has to load.

42:52.000 --> 42:56.000
I'm curious if Arasaka's got this because I know she's a big Sonic fangirl.

42:56.000 --> 42:57.000
Oh yeah, watch this.

42:57.000 --> 43:03.000
The graphics look pretty cool. Like, it's in high depth. Very well rendered.

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
Running through ramps and ice.

43:07.000 --> 43:08.000
I think that's just a trailer.

43:08.000 --> 43:12.000
Oh yeah, this is just a trailer. Yeah, of course, I'm sure it's pre-rendered, but...

43:17.000 --> 43:20.000
It's weird to me how they do this whole, like, two Sonic thing.

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
It's new Sonic and classic Sonic.

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
Yeah. It's still a little weird.

43:27.000 --> 43:30.000
It doesn't really tell me enough about the game, so...

43:30.000 --> 43:34.000
I'm sure we'll be seeing more about it at E3, but you know what the first thing that went through my head was?

43:34.000 --> 43:40.000
Whatever happened to Sonic the Hedgehog 4 Part 2? Remember how they had that Sonic the Hedgehog 4 Part 1?

43:40.000 --> 43:47.000
Somebody linked me to a story earlier because I said the same thing on Bobby's show and I got a link to a story where I guess they say it is still in development.

43:47.000 --> 43:50.000
As late as late February they were saying that the game is still in development, but...

43:50.000 --> 43:51.000
How do we make it not suck?

43:51.000 --> 44:00.000
I know, I'm kinda sitting here going, well, usually when you have an episodic game, you plan on releasing one episode a month, not one episode a year, you know?

44:00.000 --> 44:01.000
Oh, weird.

44:01.000 --> 44:02.000
Yeah, very odd.

44:02.000 --> 44:03.000
What they're doing.

44:03.000 --> 44:10.000
So, I guess there's still a Sonic the Hedgehog 4 Part 2 coming as well, but I'm also required to care about this.

44:10.000 --> 44:16.000
But we'll see when there's some actual gameplay footage to come out, hopefully around E3. We'll see about that, though.

44:16.000 --> 44:24.000
Yeah, but here's my question with the whole Sonic the Hedgehog 4 stuff, is who really cares?

44:24.000 --> 44:36.000
Because the reviews on it weren't that great, and most of the industry reviewers and the user reviews have been pretty terrible, so who cares?

44:36.000 --> 44:44.000
I mean, that's gotta suck when you're like, okay, I gotta put out a bunch of episodes now for a game that no one gives a shit about. Damn.

44:44.000 --> 44:51.000
Um, you know, it's also one of the things where I feel like they're always trying to reboot Sonic. Like, let's just reboot Sonic.

44:51.000 --> 44:57.000
Oh, we should try rebooting Sonic again. It's like Sega's perennial answer. Maybe it's time to retire, Sonic.

44:57.000 --> 45:02.000
Hate to go there, but I don't know, Sonic games have been very, very hip to us lately.

45:02.000 --> 45:12.000
It's not that difficult to fix Sonic. You make it like it was before. The old Sonic. Don't try to add werewolves into it. Don't try to make it all weird.

45:12.000 --> 45:26.000
Don't give him a sword. You know, just make it Sonic. Now, I know that you tried that with Sonic the Hedgehog 4, and it failed terribly, but you know what?

45:26.000 --> 45:35.000
We can only help you so far, so just make it like that, but not suck. That's all you gotta do.

45:35.000 --> 45:42.000
Alright, let's move on with another story here before we get into the release dates where we travel around the world and see what's coming out soon. DarkSakura?

45:42.000 --> 45:51.000
Well, actually, PopCap has decided to make a new label called 4th & Battery, and you can actually check this out at 4thandbattery.com.

45:51.000 --> 46:06.000
As all one word, number 4thandbattery.com. It is a new label to bring out experimental ideas to customer so they can be more creative, get stuff out that's a little bit, as they say, off the beaten path.

46:06.000 --> 46:16.000
So, it's pretty cool, and looks like the first thing out is gonna be called Unpleasant Horse. And watching the trailer for this, it's very silly.

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
This horse is definitely not feeling pleasant.

46:18.000 --> 46:28.000
You start off with a bird and a pegasus, and everything's happy, and then here comes a dark horse with a little skull on its butt like the evil My Little Pony.

46:28.000 --> 46:31.000
This horse is just at the Chinese buffet, and now it's feeling very unpleasant.

46:31.000 --> 46:32.000
Pooping lightning.

46:32.000 --> 46:43.000
It makes me think, though, of the bad horse from Dr. Horrible. But yeah, it looks pretty interesting. Apparently, this was an idea they had before 4th and Battery came out.

46:43.000 --> 46:50.000
But, um, they're calling this, uh, and I quote, it's a sandbox for PopCap's inner child.

46:50.000 --> 46:53.000
Well, I'm playing some of the audio here in the studio.

46:53.000 --> 46:57.000
Aw, it's a little birdie. No horse.

46:57.000 --> 47:03.000
This definitely doesn't look like other PopCap games. You're like, where's the jewels to switch? Or, you know.

47:03.000 --> 47:06.000
He farted lightning.

47:06.000 --> 47:12.000
It's like a bad horse.

47:12.000 --> 47:16.000
Random hard rock.

47:16.000 --> 47:22.000
I hope it's gonna be fun. I mean, PopCap puts out, you know, pretty high quality stuff.

47:22.000 --> 47:30.000
It was something that I thought that it got rejected because of some sort of, like, throwing horses through meat grinders or something like that.

47:30.000 --> 47:33.000
Just, like, weird, weird stuff.

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
Sounds a little bit like Super Meat Boy, if that's the case.

47:35.000 --> 47:41.000
Well, I think it was only rejected because they said it was, they classified it as, like, a family game, but it, you know, not a family game.

47:41.000 --> 47:44.000
Horses going through meat grinders are probably not very family friendly.

47:44.000 --> 47:47.000
Depends what kind of family you have.

47:47.000 --> 47:54.000
I just like in this interview on the page, it says, much like Honey Badger, unpleasant horse just don't give a shit.

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
I'm glad for the reference to Honey Badger.

47:56.000 --> 47:57.000
Yes, I love Honey Badger.

47:57.000 --> 48:05.000
And unpleasant horse, his name is Bubbles. And is female.

48:05.000 --> 48:06.000
Bubbles?

48:06.000 --> 48:10.000
I'm looking through the interview. Her name is Bubbles.

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
Sorry, I just have to look at this a little bit here.

48:12.000 --> 48:16.000
This is the Honey Badger. Watch it run in slow motion.

48:16.000 --> 48:20.000
It's pretty badass. Look, it runs all over the place.

48:20.000 --> 48:26.000
Whoa, watch out, says that bird. Ew, it's got a snake. Oh, it's chasing a jackal. Oh my gosh.

48:26.000 --> 48:29.000
Oh, the Honey Badgers are just crazy.

48:29.000 --> 48:35.000
The Honey Badger has been referred to by the Guinness Book of World Records as the most fearless animal in all of the animal kingdom.

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
It really doesn't give a shit.

48:37.000 --> 48:44.000
I love that they brought Charles Nelson Reilly back from the grave to narrate that video.

48:44.000 --> 48:47.000
Anyhow, the over 30 listeners will understand that joke.

48:47.000 --> 48:53.000
Alright, let's move on. Let's travel the world and look at some release dates and what's coming out to a video game store near you.

48:53.000 --> 48:58.000
Charles Nelson Reilly, rise from your grave.

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
Yeah, that'd be awesome.

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
Now this week, there's a few things coming out.

49:02.000 --> 49:07.000
Actually, today there was a couple 3DS games. Rabbids Travel in Time for 3DS.

49:07.000 --> 49:11.000
I'll have you know this is one of the reasons why people aren't picking up games on the 3DS,

49:11.000 --> 49:16.000
because this game is just a port of the one that was on the DS, now with some 3D in it.

49:16.000 --> 49:22.000
Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell for the 3DS looked like a game that was made for the DS.

49:22.000 --> 49:25.000
That's also out on the 3DS this week.

49:25.000 --> 49:28.000
Spongebob Squiggle Pants for uDraw.

49:28.000 --> 49:32.000
It's kind of like WarioWare, but it requires the THQ uDraw tablet.

49:32.000 --> 49:36.000
So, WarioWare for like Mario Paint.

49:36.000 --> 49:39.000
That's out on the Wii.

49:39.000 --> 49:44.000
A re-release of Attack of the Movies 3D, bundled with four blaster controllers.

49:44.000 --> 49:48.000
Trying to hit up the budget game market there.

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
That's on the Wii.

49:50.000 --> 49:55.000
Lego Battle Ninja Go on the Nintendo DS.

49:55.000 --> 50:00.000
Karaoke Revolution Glee being re-released to put the game by itself without the microphones.

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
That's coming out this week.

50:02.000 --> 50:05.000
As well as, I believe, let's see here.

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
Oh, Fantastic Pets.

50:07.000 --> 50:10.000
This is a game from THQ.

50:10.000 --> 50:17.000
It's supposed to kind of cash in on that wonderful franchise created by Connectamals.

50:17.000 --> 50:31.000
Except, you know, instead of raising tigers and whatnot, you get to raise unicorns and lizards that turn into dragons and cats that turn into purple cats.

50:31.000 --> 50:35.000
That's on the 360 for Kinect.

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
Dance Dance Revolution.

50:37.000 --> 50:40.000
Might have forgotten about that game for the other systems.

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
Now it's finally coming out on 360.

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
The bundle for 40 bucks.

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
That's a great price for the bundle.

50:46.000 --> 50:51.000
Elements of War on PC.

50:51.000 --> 50:55.000
Trackmania Turbo Build to Race on the Nintendo DS.

50:55.000 --> 50:58.000
Divinity II the Dragon Knight Saga.

50:58.000 --> 51:05.000
Kind of a redone version of Divinity II for Xbox 360 being released this week.

51:05.000 --> 51:11.000
Rio, the game tie-in for the upcoming animated movie.

51:11.000 --> 51:16.000
Coming out on DS, Xbox 360, Playstation 3, and Wii.

51:16.000 --> 51:19.000
Squinkies.

51:19.000 --> 51:23.000
This is what Activision's decided to spend their time on.

51:23.000 --> 51:30.000
It is like those little toys that you find in the 25 cent bubble machines or whatever.

51:30.000 --> 51:34.000
Yeah, something I don't understand.

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
That's coming out on DS.

51:36.000 --> 51:39.000
And Potapon 3 on PSP this week.

51:39.000 --> 51:44.000
Michael Jackson the Experience coming out on Xbox 360 and Playstation 3.

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
Are you going to buy that?

51:46.000 --> 51:49.000
You know what, actually I am looking forward to picking it up on 360.

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
So I will check that out.

51:51.000 --> 51:54.000
What is it about the Michael Jackson experience that you're looking forward to?

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
Oh, I just like the dancing games.

51:56.000 --> 51:59.000
Did you ever buy that one dancing game that came out?

51:59.000 --> 52:02.000
It's not Dance Masters, it's not Dance Central.

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
Dance Paradise? Is that what it's called?

52:04.000 --> 52:05.000
No.

52:05.000 --> 52:06.000
Really? I was looking at it.

52:06.000 --> 52:07.000
No, it looked terrible.

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
I got it and then I put it back on the shelf.

52:09.000 --> 52:10.000
Yeah, it looks terrible.

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
But it has Lady Gaga!

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
That doesn't make me buy things though, Rob.

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
It makes me buy things.

52:16.000 --> 52:19.000
It just looked terrible.

52:19.000 --> 52:25.000
And then let's see what else we've got here.

52:25.000 --> 52:28.000
Not much else really this week.

52:28.000 --> 52:33.000
I was looking, I actually saw some of these things that made me kind of scratch my head.

52:33.000 --> 52:36.000
They had like this Rocco game capture device.

52:36.000 --> 52:40.000
It didn't really say what resolution it captured in it, so I could not buy that.

52:40.000 --> 52:45.000
Yeah, that's pretty much it.

52:45.000 --> 52:46.000
Pretty much it for this week.

52:46.000 --> 52:49.000
Good stuff though in two weeks though.

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
Mortal Kombat and Portal 2.

52:51.000 --> 52:52.000
I know, it's a big week.

52:52.000 --> 52:53.000
Squeeze.

52:53.000 --> 52:54.000
Damn, there went all my money.

52:54.000 --> 52:55.000
Lots of Squeeze.

52:55.000 --> 52:58.000
It's going to be a shopping spree at Fry's.

52:58.000 --> 52:59.000
I'm still looking forward to hearing that.

52:59.000 --> 53:02.000
And a shopping Squeeze.

53:02.000 --> 53:07.000
Alright, moving on to Japan. Let's see what you can Squeeze about for the release dates over there.

53:07.000 --> 53:12.000
Cross Channel in memory of all people coming out on the Xbox 360 as well as Homefront.

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
Both getting their Japanese releases this week.

53:14.000 --> 53:17.000
Lost Planet 2 moves into the Platinum Collection this week over there as well.

53:17.000 --> 53:21.000
Trying to look up this Cross Channel in memory of all people and see what this is about.

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
I want to see if this is a game that's out over here.

53:23.000 --> 53:29.000
It's from Cyberfront and I'm not seeing a whole lot with it except a scene where the characters are in swimsuits.

53:29.000 --> 53:32.000
So this is definitely some type of anime.

53:32.000 --> 53:36.000
It's one of those anime games that's just not going to come over here because we don't get games like that here.

53:36.000 --> 53:39.000
Interactive stories is what they look like to me.

53:39.000 --> 53:46.000
Why don't we have, and this is a total random topic here, why don't we have like a telenovela game?

53:46.000 --> 53:49.000
Because that would be just so random.

53:49.000 --> 53:50.000
A Telemundo game?

53:50.000 --> 53:51.000
Yes, a Telemundo game.

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
Sabado Higante the game.

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
A bunch of little mini games on the Wii.

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
It would be different.

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
There's been nothing.

53:59.000 --> 54:00.000
It would be awesome.

54:00.000 --> 54:05.000
I would like to see them go back and take the old Sentos franchises.

54:05.000 --> 54:08.000
The Mexican wrestler superhero.

54:08.000 --> 54:09.000
That would be awesome.

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
Well they did have the Mexican wrestling game.

54:11.000 --> 54:12.000
Yeah, and it sucked.

54:12.000 --> 54:16.000
But I'm talking about something ridiculous.

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
Like Italian Spiderman.

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
Even though that's not real.

54:20.000 --> 54:26.000
It would still be awesome to take that fake character and make an Italian Spiderman game.

54:26.000 --> 54:33.000
I'm trying to see what type of shows are on Telemundo these days that they could make a show out of.

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
Of course this thing is trying to...

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
Let's see, what are the...

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
I don't know what the big shows on Telemundo are.

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
I don't really watch it.

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
There's Shakira.

54:43.000 --> 54:46.000
Alright, this is a terrible segment. Let me move on with the releases.

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
PlayStation 3.

54:48.000 --> 54:51.000
Lost Planet 2 also gets a price reduction there.

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
Homefront comes out on there as well.

54:53.000 --> 54:56.000
There's also a game called Pro Yaku Spirits 2011.

54:56.000 --> 54:57.000
Baseball.

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
From Konami. Yep, it's a baseball sim.

54:59.000 --> 55:00.000
Trying to see...

55:00.000 --> 55:03.000
It looked, from the cover for a minute, it looked like it was kind of like chibi basketball.

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
But no, this is like real-deal Japanese...

55:05.000 --> 55:06.000
I'm sorry, basketball.

55:06.000 --> 55:07.000
Japanese baseball.

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
So this is Japanese baseball.

55:09.000 --> 55:10.000
Actually it looks really good.

55:10.000 --> 55:11.000
Yeah.

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
I have a friend on LiveJournal who will be really into that.

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
She loves her Japanese baseball.

55:15.000 --> 55:22.000
Let's see, also coming out, WRC Fia World Rally Championship.

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
That's a racing game if you didn't know.

55:24.000 --> 55:25.000
From Deep Silver.

55:25.000 --> 55:28.000
Moving on to the Nintendo Wii.

55:28.000 --> 55:31.000
Trying to see if they have anything coming out on there this week.

55:31.000 --> 55:32.000
They don't.

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
But next week you can get Billy's Bootcamp.

55:34.000 --> 55:38.000
Wii Day Enjoy Diet.

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
Yet another game there.

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
Coming out this week on the 3DS in Japan.

55:42.000 --> 55:43.000
Pilotwings Resort.

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
They didn't get it at launch, but they're getting it now.

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
Pilotwings Resort comes out this week in Japan.

55:47.000 --> 55:54.000
Also Pro Yaku Spirits 2011, so the baseball sim comes out on the 3DS this week as well.

55:54.000 --> 56:00.000
And lastly on the PSP this week, we have Last Rancor gets a price reduction.

56:00.000 --> 56:06.000
We have Dai Tu Zhi Super Robot Taisen Zee Hakai Hen comes out this week as well.

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
That's Robot Wars series.

56:08.000 --> 56:09.000
And that's coming out.

56:09.000 --> 56:13.000
It's a strategy game on the PSP if you like those games.

56:13.000 --> 56:18.000
And lastly, Persona 2 Sumi, Innocent Sin comes out this week.

56:18.000 --> 56:23.000
So if you're a fan of the Persona series, I think this is like a spinoff series that's on the portable.

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
It might be like a remake or something.

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
Yeah, that's available this week on the PSP.

56:27.000 --> 56:28.000
So check it out.

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
Sounds fun.

56:30.000 --> 56:33.000
Well we have just a few things coming out in Europe.

56:33.000 --> 56:37.000
On 12th we have World of Tanks for the PC.

56:37.000 --> 56:42.000
On the 15th, Lego Ninja Go, the video game on the DS.

56:42.000 --> 56:46.000
And also Michael Jackson, the experience on PS3 and Xbox 360.

56:46.000 --> 56:50.000
They don't get the Mortal Kombat joy until after we do.

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
So, just saying.

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
Those poor guys always have to wait.

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
Portal 2 is out on my birthday, hint, hint.

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
Everybody.

56:58.000 --> 57:01.000
I have a Steam account.

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
Alright.

57:03.000 --> 57:07.000
I want to get the PlayStation 3 one so I get the PS3 game and the Steam game, right?

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
I have a PS3.

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
That's what I plan to do.

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
Alright, moving on.

57:13.000 --> 57:18.000
So this week, a hacking group named Anonymous.

57:18.000 --> 57:22.000
Oh, I had a feeling it was Anonymous.

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
Yeah.

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
Anonymous.

57:26.000 --> 57:35.000
They are now apparently, I guess, battling Sony now because they're saying,

57:35.000 --> 57:43.000
We are currently investigating including the possibility of targeted behavior from an outside party.

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
Yes, they were getting hacked.

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
They already said.

57:47.000 --> 57:56.000
Apparently, the group said they declare loyalty to GeoHot and Raph Chocolo.

57:56.000 --> 58:06.000
Two hackers, well, GeoHot, obviously, the one, has the keys that people want.

58:06.000 --> 58:11.000
Release some of them so that people can actually start doing homebrew stuff.

58:11.000 --> 58:18.000
And Raph Chocolo was behind bringing Linux back to the PS3 and he's a big part of that.

58:18.000 --> 58:22.000
In fact, he's still actually doing hacking stuff based on that.

58:22.000 --> 58:33.000
Basically, they're saying they're attacking Sony's private property because we disagree with their actions.

58:33.000 --> 58:39.000
And they're going to keep on doing that.

58:39.000 --> 58:46.000
So they were attacking the PlayStation Network and Sony's websites and stuff like that.

58:46.000 --> 58:55.000
Of course, I guess, they realize that attacking the PlayStation Network kind of hurts the people that they're trying to fight for.

58:55.000 --> 58:59.000
So they're saying, OK, we decided that we're not going to attack the PlayStation Network at this time,

58:59.000 --> 59:06.000
but they're going to find different ways to attack Sony, I guess.

59:06.000 --> 59:13.000
One of them being that they're going to, I guess, reveal a bunch of information about Sony's upper management,

59:13.000 --> 59:27.000
including crazy stuff like all their personal information, email addresses, addresses, phone numbers, pictures of their family, where they live, all sorts of crazy stuff.

59:27.000 --> 59:30.000
See, some of that stuff gets a little cray cray.

59:30.000 --> 59:40.000
The DOS attack is one thing, but the whole pictures of family, when you start involving kids, I don't think anybody's comfortable with that.

59:40.000 --> 59:44.000
But then you've got to wonder, maybe that's just a smear campaign. I don't know.

59:44.000 --> 59:47.000
The whole point is just to make them feel uncomfortable, I think.

59:47.000 --> 59:54.000
Anonymous, I mean, I'm going to plead a little bit ignorance here because I don't really fully understand what's going on there.

59:54.000 --> 01:00:02.000
I know it's a big group. I know there's a lot of people. I know about the in-person stuff they do with Scientology, and I know it's kind of a spin off of 4chan.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:06.000
I love the logo. The logo is fucking awesome.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:10.000
So nobody's really in charge there because it's Anonymous?

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.000
No, no one's really in charge.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
They actually grew on 4chan.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:17.000
So it's like a Borg thing. It's a group collective, right?

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
Is that how it works?

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
I'm sure there's people behind it, but...

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:24.000
It all runs on groupthink? Because it's...

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:41.000
Surely somebody in Anonymous says, dude, pictures of families, not okay. It's one thing to order illegitimate pizzas and send them to Sony headquarters, but when you start posting pictures of people's kids, that's too much.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:48.000
And then... Sony, Sony, Sony.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:59.000
And this is the thing too, especially with any kind of radical type group, it's that if they don't follow through on the threat, no one's going to take them seriously.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:04.000
Oh, they won't do that. But the thing is, I'm pretty damn sure they will.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:18.000
And it's that sort of, I hate to put it this way, but sort of like integrity, if you know what I mean? The fact that if they say they're going to do it, they're going to do it.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:23.000
That gets people, you know, listening to them.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:31.000
Well, the other thing they were too pissed off about was the fact that Sony was collecting the IP addresses for everybody that visited GeoHot's site.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
Well, that was ridiculous.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:42.000
And they're saying, no, if you do anything with that, you go after anybody, you're going to have hell to pay.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:49.000
So, the other thing is, okay, I don't understand these companies.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:56.000
Basically, Sony hired this outside company to help protect them during this DDOS attack.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:09.000
So, they have the hosting provider for Sony, they're belittling Anonymous' cyber attack, calling it medium strength, and something that's only annoyed our network engineers.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:16.000
Why would you say something like that? That's just going to piss them off and make them try harder.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:23.000
Do people not learn? Oh, our system's unhackable! It's the most secure system ever!

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:28.000
Oh, your attack was pathetic! I've seen worse from my ground!

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:31.000
It's like, seriously, why would you do that?

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
Yeah, I'm kind of surprised they acknowledged it at all.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:38.000
It's like, oh great, thank you dumbass that had to open your mouth. Now you're going to...

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:44.000
It's just going to piss them off. That's all you're doing. You're just going to piss them off now.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:48.000
Great. Can't wait to see what happens this week.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
Piss who off?

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:54.000
See, that's just the part, you know...

01:02:54.000 --> 01:03:06.000
I don't know. There's definitely got to be a lot of varying opinions within that group, such as like, how far do you go?

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:12.000
So, you know. I don't know. We'll see what happens.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:20.000
Well, we know what this one guy did. There's one individual that did something in it. Had to do a little bit with hacking and so forth.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:24.000
It has to do with Xbox. Since we talked about Sony, let's talk about Xbox.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:29.000
This was an Xbox Live user who'd been banned from the service over 35 times.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:35.000
He went out and did some bad things to Steven Toulouse. I think I'm saying that right. It might be Toulouse.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:43.000
Sorry if I'm saying that wrong. But he's one of the executives and this guy is big up on Xbox Live. Like, he's pretty much the head of Xbox Live.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:47.000
And this guy actually ended up essentially hacking the Xbox Live account.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:51.000
But I want to point out, he didn't hack through Xbox Live.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:57.000
He hacked the computer that sent the email for the password reset to get to the Xbox Live account.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:00.000
So, you know, your Xbox Live account is fine for now.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:04.000
This guy did this to kind of get his point across.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:10.000
Obviously, the guy is the director of policy and enforcement for Xbox Live. So, it's not like he couldn't get his own account back.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:16.000
The hacker is named Predator and he basically made a whole little boasting thing on YouTube.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:24.000
And, I don't know, it was kind of like talking a lot about how he's doing them a favor and so forth. I don't know. Kind of weird.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:28.000
I think he's trying to be one of those hackers that really wants to get hired by the company.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
But I don't know if that's really the best way to go about doing it.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:34.000
But you know how companies will hire hackers to help improve the integrity of the system?

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:38.000
I think maybe that's what this guy is trying to do, but he's going about it the wrong way.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:43.000
Especially if you get banned from Xbox Live 35 times, you're probably just a dick, dude.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
It means they probably don't want to deal with you at all.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:49.000
Yeah. So, this probably wasn't the best way to get your point across.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:53.000
Maybe a nice little heartfelt, I'm sorry. Be better. I don't know.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:05:01.000
Alright, anyhow, we're going to now walk through Classic Game Archives and... what's that?

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:02.000
You should start with the old music first.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:07.000
Okay, yeah. The Classic Game of the Week is the next segment. Thank you for totally derailing me.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
Sorry!

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:16.000
Every week on the show we have a segment where DarkSakura looks in the Classic Gaming vault and picks out one game that she says,

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:21.000
Hey! You kids ought to be checking this out this week. It's the Classic Game of the Week.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:22.000
DarkSakura, what is the Classic Game of the Week?

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:27.000
It's actually two games. It's Killer Instinct, both one and two, because I had to put them together.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
Alright.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
But the first one's really the best.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:36.000
Let's check out some of this music. The ambience from Killer Instinct 1.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:41.000
This used to be my favorite music in the game, was killer music.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:49.000
Anyway, Killer Instinct was developed by Rare and published by Midway and Nintendo and was in the arcades in 1994.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:54.000
And it was rumored to use the Ultra 64 hardware engine.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:06:02.000
In fact, there was actually this teaser for it being on Nintendo Ultra 64, if anyone remembers that.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:07.000
But this game had a pretty unique system for it.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:15.000
It had some moves that were very similar to how Street Fighter worked, but also had Mortal Kombat style finishing moves.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:24.000
And a few other kind of neat things. It had a double energy bar, so that instead of winning two rounds, you actually just had two bars of energy.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:29.000
When you finished one up, the fight would pause and your new bar would fill up, so that's how it worked.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:34.000
You had combos that if you pressed the buttons in a certain order, they would just auto combo.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:43.000
And then you had your finishers that are called No Mercy, although other versions called it a danger move.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:49.000
And it was basically, you know, violent finishers, like an orchid would flash your boobs and the other person would die of a heart attack.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:54.000
Unless it was another orchid, then she'd just stomp her feet and be jealous. That was cute.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:59.000
And then you also had humiliations where it would make people dance, and they had different dance styles.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:06.000
You had the Ultra combo that was, basically they'd just go into this huge ass auto combo.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:13.000
But with some of the characters you could actually keep re-juggling with extra hits at the end of the combo, so you could get over 80 hits.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:17.000
I was always really good at the 44 hit combo with orchid.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:29.000
Anyway, you also had combo breakers where if you either hit in the double digits or were in the combo link stage, you could do this little move and it would break the combo.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:38.000
A combo breaker! Anyway, so it was pretty neat. You also could do these advanced moves right after you did a combo breaker.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:42.000
Like, Jago for example would have a red fireball instead of the green one.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:49.000
So your characters in the first one were Fulgore, Cinder, Glaceous, Jago, Riptor, Saberwolf, Spinal, who was actually the second to last.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:54.000
No, the third to- the second to last. Because I think Fulgore was after him and then it was idle.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:59.000
Anyway, TJ combo, Chief Thunder, orchid, well it says B orchid I guess it's supposed to be black orchid, and idle.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:06.000
Who didn't have any special moves at all, except he could refill his life by stomping on the ground.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:11.000
It was also the first arcade game that had an internal hard drive.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:16.000
And the game was actually done in pre-rendered sprites that was done by Silicon Graphics.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:23.000
And the backgrounds were pre-rendered as a movie, but the frames would adjust based on where the characters were.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:31.000
So it was pretty cool. It also used the R4600 processor. It's pretty cool.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
And, oh you film?

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:36.000
I'm just jumping to random ones, playing a little bit before you get to the second game.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:40.000
There was a SNES version, it had a lot of stuff cut out and way panned out.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:48.000
But it came with Killer Cuts, which was a 16 track remix version of all the songs.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:54.000
And you could actually order it through Nintendo Power, or you could get the CD if you bought the game.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
I got mine because I bought the game.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:04.000
And it was in a black case. There was a Game Boy version, but if you played it on the Super Game Boy, it had actually limited color added to it.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:09.000
And you could play it two player, and they actually really toned down a lot of the characters' moves.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:17.000
For the Nintendo 64, there was not a Killer Instinct or Killer Instinct 2, but you had Killer Instinct Gold that was based off of Killer Instinct 2.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:23.000
And that leads us to Killer Instinct 2! Yay!

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
How about some new music, Rob?

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:26.000
Working on it.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
Okay.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:33.000
Killer Instinct 2 is the sequel, and they changed moves.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
Annoying.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
Which one is this?

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
Working.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:45.000
Yeah, that was the CD version.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:54.000
But it was really cool. This was my favorite music in the game.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:10:01.000
Now, I'll tell you, when Dan got Killer Instinct Gold, I had him, because you had to keep starting the game over to get the right music.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:06.000
And he actually recorded an MP3 of this for me, because I wanted it that badly.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:07.000
I was a big nerd.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:11.000
This is when we were first friends on the interwebs.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:27.000
But KI2 basically had similar control, and it had the whole life bar thing the way that Killer Instinct was.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:32.000
And I had auto combos, but they changed a few things.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:41.000
Some of the normal moves, though, were toned down, and then you also had different blocking moves that were thrown in.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
You also had throws, too.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:48.000
And then there were ways to glitch a combo and do different moves along with that.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:56.000
It basically had sort of a rock-paper-scissors system with how certain moves could be tied to certain moves.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
And it was really bizarre.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:01.000
Killer Instinct 2, for me, was a lot harder of a game.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:05.000
And then you had a super bar where you could fill it up when you take damage.

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:11.000
And then you could do a huge super move, which was an extended version of the regular move.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:21.000
And it had actually a parry system, so you could counter-attack after a block, and all kinds of different stuff.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:27.000
It was new finishing moves, all kinds of new stuff, and no humiliations, though.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:30.000
But every character had two ultimate combos.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
And you could still do ultra combos.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:40.000
So, with the characters in this one, the ones that came back were Full Gore-Jago's final TJ combo, Glaceous Saberwolf, and Orchid.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:43.000
And all of her moves changed. It was so weird.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:47.000
And then the new characters were Maya, who was the one that I used the most.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:51.000
And according to Nintendo Power, she was the worst dress of 1996.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
She had nice boobies.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:56.000
And Tusk, who was, like, her dude.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:03.000
Kim Wu, who was actually pretty fun. And Gargos, who was a demon lord, who was the rival of Eidol.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:06.000
Ooh. And you could only use him with a cheat code.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:12.000
So, they had different endings based on how you beat the game.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:21.000
So, like, Jago's was different based on if he kills Orchid or if he kills Full Gore.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:24.000
It's weird stuff, but they had all kinds of different stuff.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:31.000
With Kill Instinct Gold, which is the Nintendo 64 version that I said before, it was a near-launch title.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:35.000
And it did downgrade a few things, but it was pretty darn faithful.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:39.000
You had team battles where you could fight with up to 11 characters.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:45.000
You had elimination battles, training and advanced training, and a full option menu where you could modify stuff.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:53.000
Like, how fast the game went, the color of the blood button configuration, and your controller pack data and unlockable content, like different colors.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:58.000
And different scenarios and faster speeds of the game. You could make it, like, super fast.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:07.000
And most of the full motion video scenes were pretty much removed because, hi, it was a Nintendo 64, it was a cartridge.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:13.000
And so they did simple animations instead.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:20.000
And the game was fully rendered in 3D instead of the whole scaling full motion video.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:26.000
So it was pretty close to being good.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:31.000
And there actually was some censorship about that around Orchid.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:46.000
In the full version, there was a scene with Orchid in the introduction, and they actually played it on a UK show called Game Master,

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:51.000
but it was cut when the arcade release came out, so maybe someone can fight it on YouTube. Who knows?

01:13:51.000 --> 01:14:02.000
But it won four Nintendo Power Awards, and has a really good soundtrack called the Killer Instinct Gold Cuts soundtrack.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:06.000
And that's it.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:10.000
Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week, Killer Instincts 1 and 2.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
I guess 2 will have to share the stage this week.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:13.000
Let's just say gold.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:14.000
Fine, Killer Instinct Gold.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
But with major nods to the arcade versions.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:17.000
You got it.

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:23.000
Alright, that's going to do it for part A of our show, but don't go anywhere. We've got plenty more to cover when we come back.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:29.000
When we come back, we're going to get into some things such as some rapid fire news, including news on Ninja Gaiden 3.

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:32.000
Not the old one on the NES, but for new consoles.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:37.000
Talk a little bit more about Michael Jackson The Experience, some new tracks coming out for Rock Band,

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:42.000
some changes going on at GameStop, and Atari reboots on iOS devices.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:47.000
We're going to talk about all that and more when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:53.000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, live on this Sunday evening, April the 10th of 2011,

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:58.000
as we do tape live on Sunday nights at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:03.000
Now, we can't play the music on the podcast feed, but I have to mention this.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:06.000
That last song cut off rather awkwardly, didn't it?

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
It was kind of suddenly like, and we're live.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:11.000
I can play clips. You can get away with playing clips on podcasts.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:15.000
We were playing a track called Work It Out from, what is this, Sonic R, right?

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:18.000
So let me just play, let me play the last like 10 seconds of the MP3 here,

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:21.000
and you get to see how awkwardly this cut off.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:26.000
I'm jamming, I'm jamming, I'm jamming, and it's done.

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:29.000
You just kind of cut off.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
I hate how video game soundtracks kind of do that sometimes,

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:35.000
but they're usually set up that way because they loop over and over again, so they don't like really fade out.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:38.000
So that's how usually you can tell the song that was kind of ripped from the game,

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:41.000
or if it was for a CD, usually it will fade out on a CD

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:45.000
because they don't want those awkward transitions like that, so.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:50.000
Anyhow, let's get into some rapid fire news, and then we'll get into Twitter topics.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:55.000
Of course, this is the last call for tweets at, at OLR on Twitter, so we're getting those in.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:58.000
We have a few, I like more random questions on the Twitter tonight.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
You know, video game questions are cool too.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
If you want to talk about news, that's fine. Link us to stories.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:05.000
I want some random questions, random gaming questions.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:09.000
Also, we always like to plug our other projects that we work on.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:12.000
Dark Soccer has another podcast if you like OLR you might like.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:18.000
It is called Comic Insanity, and it is me, Maren Marvel, and Dan Shadow, and we talk about comics.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:22.000
And we did not have a show this week, but next week.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:23.000
Frown.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:24.000
We will have a show.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:25.000
Smile.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
Grin. Happy face.

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:28.000
Any more bigs?

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:31.000
You can check us at infamous.net, N-F-A-M-O-U-S.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
Any more big celebrities planned for your show?

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:34.000
You had some guy that was on Heroes.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
He was really cool. Todd Stashwick.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:37.000
Really nice guy.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:38.000
Who is he?

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:39.000
Todd Stashwick.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:44.000
He was in season 4, so unfortunately it was after I stopped watching.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:47.000
He's been in Buffy and Supernatural.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:50.000
Fine. What was his power?

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
He was the multiple man.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:55.000
Oh. Multiplicity sucked.

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
The power to make you listen to any podcast.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:00.000
But he's a really cool guy. Really, really nice.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:05.000
And, uh, there's more coming.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
It's hard being an actor in Hollywood, too.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:11.000
Like, if I had been offered the role of a hero that just made people defecate on command.

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:14.000
That would be awesome!

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:19.000
They call me the Brown Note.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:23.000
If Rob thought of his nickname, it would be Poopy Pants.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
There you go.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
Well, excuse me, Mr. Poopy Pants.

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:30.000
Defecating on command? Where do I sign?

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
The Defecator.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:33.000
Nice.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:34.000
The Defecatrix.

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:38.000
Well, now that I've brought defecation and your show in the same sentence, I apologize for that.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:41.000
But anything else you want to say about Comic Insanity?

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:42.000
We're awesome. Listen to us.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:49.000
Alright. My Side Project is a show with the one and only X Tufur called The Best Lil' Horde House in Azeroth.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:52.000
Called Horde House for short. Visit us at www.hordehouse.com.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:56.000
If you like World of Warcraft, or even if you don't, you just like digging fart jokes, join us every week.

01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:00.000
We put new shows up about Friday. We don't tape live right now. Maybe someday.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:03.000
We definitely want to get back into that at some point.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:07.000
I do want to throw this out there. Hordehouse.com is the website behind it.

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:11.000
And we've been having more and more people kind of write for the site.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:14.000
And by more I mean one other person, but we have another one planned too.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:20.000
And one of the articles you just posted about How to Closet Your Dragon was the article.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:27.000
It's about how Blizzard has kind of deflamboyantized one of the monsters that was in Warcraft.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
It's been getting a ton of hits through Reddit.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:34.000
It's like a controversial article and I'm very excited because it's only like the third blog post on our site.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
So, big things in the future at Horde House.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:39.000
Lots of hordes to talk about.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:43.000
Alright. That's it. Let's move into some rapid fire news.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
And then we'll get to your tweets.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:48.000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R one more time.

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:55.000
Loki. The latest issue of the official PlayStation Magazine had some neat little tidbits regarding the new Ninja Gaiden game.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:19:01.000
Ninja Gaiden 3, which is going to be 3. Not Sigma 3. Just 3. Both systems.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:04.000
You know, all playing around harmoniously.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:10.000
There is some info. They're saying that there's going to be a complex multiplayer mode.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:15.000
They're not really drawing comparisons with Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:20.000
But, you know, that sounds neat.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:23.000
I mean, everybody has multiplayer nowadays, so why not?

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:29.000
They're saying that also Ryu is going to be the only playable character in the game this time around.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:37.000
None of these all, you know, bonus characters from Dead or Alive or, you know, the DS or whatever.

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:44.000
They're also saying that there are going to be, you know, many difficulty levels, I guess.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:55.000
They're not necessarily making the game easier, but they're going to try to make the game more exciting and being able to be enjoyed by everybody, as well as hardcore gamers.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:20:01.000
So, I'm assuming you'll probably hear more at E3 about this game, because it sounds like a pretty big one.

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:06.000
Then, of course, Japan. Japan, Japan, Japan.

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:13.000
They put out a lot of weird games in Japan, and there's a couple highlights that were on blogs this week.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:24.000
One comes from Famitsu. It's a cell phone game that's called I Love Woman's Body Climber.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:31.000
Basically, the premise is you climb up girls, and you are climbing them.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:40.000
For example, it's kind of like Shadow of the Colossus, but with schoolgirl anime chicks, and you're this tiny little dude.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:50.000
So, you have to, for example, it's harder to climb up bare skin than, say, pull yourself up on one of their sailor suits or whatever.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:59.000
Weird shit, but it's interesting. It sells for, I guess, 315 yen, which is relatively cheap.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:02.000
Does the little song play while you're climbing the woman?

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:12.000
It should, though.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:20.000
You know what, people? Since the big thing is to now knock off games on Xbox Live Indie Marketplace.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:24.000
There you go. That's a niche that's not being filled with weird shit like that.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:32.000
Scale woman's bodies to yodel music. That'd be awesome. Seriously, that would be just amazing.

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:37.000
That was inspired by the cliffhangers game on The Price is Right, by the way, when a little dude climbs the mountain.

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:42.000
Yodels? Forget it. Lots of old-school game show references on tonight's show.

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:59.000
Okay, let's see. The next game, which I'm going to try to pronounce here, but I probably will do a bad job of it. It's Gachi Tora, Abrarenbo, Kyoshi in High School.

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:16.000
And basically, this looks like a weird high school game with a system called the Soul Nude Battle System. And what the Soul Nude Battle System is, apparently you can...

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
I hope this isn't a Kinect game.

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:31.000
You can break a wall. It says you can break a wall the student has placed around her heart by screaming at them or something, using soul words.

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:39.000
So why do I have a feeling like, you know, a chef being in there, you know? Chef's Soul Nude Battle System.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:46.000
Basically, you scream at people and they take off their clothes, or their clothes come off. So that's what that's about, and that's on the PSP.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:59.000
What's also weird though, on top of all that, I guess you also can play baseball and do some other weird minigames in there, but it just looks very oddball.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:03.000
Screaming at someone and makes them naked. If only that worked.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:16.000
It's almost like Pee Wee's secret word of the day. When someone says the word of the day, scream real loud.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:19.000
And then last but not least...

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
Clothes fly off like the Minnie Hill Show.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:35.000
Little bit of a disappointment. Come on, Nintendo. Why? Why? Why? DSiWare. I guess, you know, the DSi shop, although not available yet, much like the Wii Shop originally worked.

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:41.000
Games from the DSi shop cannot be run off of an SD memory card.

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:53.000
And while the Wii had a patch later on that allowed you to do that, the DSi does not allow you that. You have to put the game on the internal memory and that's where it's going to stay.

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:56.000
And that's it.

01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:05.000
It says apparently though, of course, the 3DSWare and Virtual Console games will be able to directly play off an SD card.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:14.000
DSiWare that you buy new or transfer over on the 3DS still requires you to store it to the internal memory of the 3DS.

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:18.000
It's kind of a step backwards, I guess.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
Is that like their copy protection?

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:29.000
No, it doesn't make any sense. DSiWare is the only thing that's stuck like that. 3DSWare or Virtual Console stuff? Oh, you can put that back and forth.

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
DSiWare? No.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
That's weird.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:38.000
Must be something about the, I don't know, emulating or something, I don't know.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:43.000
Something that they have running on there probably is limiting it, but I mean, come on. Just patch that shit.

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:48.000
Well, but I mean, let's be real, Loki. Is there anything on DSiWare that you really have to play that bad?

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:51.000
Yes, actually there is something now that you mentioned it.

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:52.000
Uh oh.

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
It was something that didn't make our show roll, but it's pretty awesome.

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:59.000
It's a DSiWare application, not even really a game. It's called Inchworm Animation.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:13.000
And this thing is just fucking crazy. Basically, it's an animation program developed by Bob Sebastian from Flat Black Films, the company responsible for rotoscoping in The Waking Life and in the Scanner Darkly.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:19.000
And apparently this game or program or whatever you want to do, you can do all sorts of crazy stuff.

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:25.000
You can do rotoscoping, you can do green screen, you can do time lapse photography using this.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:33.000
You can make your own animations, all sorts of crazy stuff for five dollars. Five dollars.

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:38.000
Seriously, they could have sold this shit for, you know, thirty dollars and been able to sell a ton of it.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
But yeah, that's coming out April 25th.

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:44.000
Nice. Alright. Well, let's move on.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:50.000
Of course, I can't play it on April 25th because they haven't released a damn store yet for, you know, the 3DS.

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:54.000
Oh, sorry, we didn't finish that part of the 3DS.

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:58.000
Well, something you will be able to buy whenever it does come out, you don't know Jack.

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:03.000
Of course, the revival just came out on the 360 and the PlayStation 3 and it's pretty damn good.

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:09.000
You'll be able to now buy this on the iPhone or your whatever iOS device, iTouch, iPad.

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:13.000
We don't know exactly when, but it has been announced that you don't know Jack is coming out on these systems.

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:18.000
It kind of strikes me as a duh because, you know, you don't know Jack. It comes out on every system.

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
So I'm not surprised it's coming out on iOS as well.

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:28.000
Now, it's not going to support multiplayer, however. It will have Game Center support and it will have 20 full episodes.

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:33.000
Now, I don't know if these are 20 recycled episodes in the console games or 20 all new episodes.

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:39.000
I really hope it's all new. But yeah, the game is on its way at some point.

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:45.000
Battlefield 3, some people are very exciting about this and it's going to have a lot of ads.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:49.000
I hope you like your ads in your game because Battlefield 3 is going to have a lot of them.

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:54.000
That's right because, let's see, John Riccitello, who of course is the Electronic Arts CEO,

01:26:54.000 --> 01:27:03.000
he was talking to advertisers saying, quote, expect a couple hundred million dollars in marketing against, you know, the Call of Duty and so forth.

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
It's designed to take Call of Duty down.

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:12.000
Now, Riccitello said, kind of in a follow-up to that, that in-game advertising doesn't necessarily mean billboards.

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:18.000
Half of online multiplayer time is spent in lobbies and that's where folks are expecting advertising.

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:21.000
So you might be seeing ads in the lobbies, you should wait for games.

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:27.000
No, people are expecting advertising on TV, not on a multiplayer lobby.

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
That's kind of just an asshole thing to do.

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:33.000
So not only are there going to be ads on TV for the game, for them to try and beat Call of Duty,

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:38.000
but there's going to be plenty of ads in the game as well. That should be lots of fun.

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:43.000
Hey, Michael Jackson, the experience, the game that Loki's looking forward to next week on the Xbox 360,

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:47.000
it's already sold 3 million units globally because, you know, the game has been out on the Wii.

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:51.000
It's basically just dance, but it's all Michael Jackson songs.

01:27:51.000 --> 01:28:01.000
Yeah, the Wii, the DS and PSP versions, they've sold 319,000 units in the UK, 11%, they said, of the global sales.

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:04.000
So that means it's sold about 3 million worldwide.

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:07.000
I'm not too surprised that this is probably sold a lot, especially in the US.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
You know, people love their Michael Jackson.

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
So, there you go.

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:14.000
But so much for the music genre being dead.

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
Yeah, that's true, that's true.

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
Alright, DarkSakura.

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:23.000
Well, we definitely have other news.

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:29.000
Going into Rock Band, we have Fleetwood Mac and, of course, a solo member, Stevie Nicks.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:33.000
This is the Fleetwood Mac slash Stevie Nicks Pack 1.

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:37.000
It has Dreams by Fleetwood Mac, Gold Dust Woman, Landslide, and Rhiannon.

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:41.000
And then from Stevie Nicks, there's Edge of Seventeen and Stand Back.

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:50.000
And it looks like Dreams and Edge of Seventeen both have Pro Guitar bass expansions available for another 99 cents.

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
God, I love Stevie Nicks. She's a fierce bitch.

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:53.000
She is.

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:59.000
And then, ooh, Silent Hill Revelation, which is gonna be the next movie based off of Silent Hill 3.

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:05.000
And Carrie-Anne Moss is gonna be in it as Claudia Wolf, who may or may not be evil.

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:13.000
And we also have in there Malcolm McDowell, who's going to be Leonard Wolf, who may or may not be evil.

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:17.000
Who knows? We've played the game we know.

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:21.000
And then Mass Effect 3 is not going to be multiplayer.

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:25.000
They may do multiplayer in later games, but not Mass Effect 3.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
Confirmed Mass Effect 4.

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:35.000
They are going to expand the RPG elements with larger skill trees and different power evolutions.

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:44.000
And they are not going to make the weapons as customizable as they were, but they're going to have different behavioral changes and appearance changes.

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:48.000
And all weapons can be used by all classes.

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:52.000
So, cool. But not as cool.

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
Is it?

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:55.000
I don't know.

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:58.000
Alright, let's get to the Twitter topics.

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:02.000
Every week we invite you guys to tweet us at twitter.com slash OLR.

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:03.000
Let's read some of the tweets tonight.

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:07.000
Defective Candy tweets us and says, forgot my MP3 player the other day.

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:11.000
Was so happy I remembered about OLR's Podlines.

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:14.000
Phone plus OLR equals awesome.

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
And I had to rack my brain for a minute after reading this tweet.

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:19.000
I was like, what the hell is Podlines?

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:26.000
And then I remembered, there's this service online called Podlines where apparently you can like call and listen to podcasts on the phone.

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:29.000
Like you don't even need an iPhone or whatever to do it.

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:35.000
So, I don't really officially endorse this site, but I guess it's kind of cool what they're doing.

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:39.000
Apparently you can call this number and, you know, I'm going to call it and see what happens actually right now.

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:46.000
You can call this number, it's area code 650, so please notice that is not an 800 number, so there is a charge with that.

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:50.000
It's area code 650-523-6855.

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:55.000
And this is from the website Podlines, L-I-N-E-Z dot com.

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:58.000
And let's see what happens when we give it a call.

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
Am I going to hear myself? I guess so.

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:04.000
New music from independent artists. Call song numbers radio.

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:07.000
Well, I don't know, I don't care about these independent artists.

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:08.000
Don't you hear me?

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:09.000
Quadruple zero.

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
I don't want to hear the ad, I want to hear me.

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:19.000
Wow, it's last week's show in really crappy quality.

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:26.000
Wow, it's last week's show.

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:29.000
You can listen on the phone, call on your cell phone.

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:32.000
Interesting.

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:37.000
I guess that's a neat idea for a service though, and obviously they're making money off those little ads in the beginning.

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:40.000
A lot of people have like damn limited minutes plan or, you know, stuff like that.

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:43.000
True, especially night time minutes like if you're working a graveyard shift.

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
Too cheap for an iPhone, there's a way to do it.

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:50.000
Alright, let's see. Ronnie Bailey is saying at OLR, listening to OLR.

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:53.000
I want an OLR autograph.

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
Okay, I've got a tissue, I've got a pen.

01:31:55.000 --> 01:32:01.000
Alright, Ronnie Bailey just needs to DM us his address and we will autograph something and send it to him.

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
How about an empty CD case?

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
We'll find something. I might have something in.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:06.000
There's my coffee cup.

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
You would give away your coffee cup?

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:09.000
It's in the trash can right now.

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:10.000
Oh, it's a Starbucks coffee cup.

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
Alright, we'll find something for Ronnie Bailey.

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:13.000
We'll find something that isn't trash.

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
DM us your address and we will send you something.

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:16.000
Yeah.

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:19.000
Alright, just because you asked.

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:22.000
And I don't want everybody else jumping in there and saying, I want free shit, I want free shit.

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:25.000
No, Ronnie Bailey gets it because he has it nicely first.

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:29.000
Alright, let's see. Tiger Claw says his tweet, oh I heard about this.

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:32.000
This is 1 versus 100. It's coming back y'all. 1 versus 100 is coming back.

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:33.000
Yay.

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
Not on Xbox Live though.

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:36.000
Boo.

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:39.000
1 versus 100 is coming back as a Facebook game.

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
Double Boo.

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
Where's my fail horn for that one?

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:47.000
1 versus 100 is coming back as a Facebook game.

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:51.000
I guess the version on Game Show Network didn't do too hot, just so you know.

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:55.000
It's being developed by iWin. It is being licensed by NML USA.

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:58.000
And it will be the mob versus the one structure.

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:04.000
Individual players will be inviting their friends to join the mob to answer questions.

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:08.000
And I guess either knock off them or the user. I don't really know how this works.

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:11.000
So there's also Facebook different modes there.

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:15.000
It will not just be the Xbox version ported. It's being remade by iWin.

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:19.000
But if you want to play 1 versus 100, I guess you'll have to go to Facebooks.

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:24.000
You can put that in between your farm and your Knights of the Clicky.

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:28.000
Another tweet from Tiger Claw 305.

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:33.000
Apparently Kojima has been teasing a new Snatcher game.

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:39.000
Didn't we have a rumor a couple weeks ago that Kojima was working on something new and didn't really say what it was yet?

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:44.000
Stop working on new stuff and finish the damn game that you have in progress.

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:47.000
Well hey, a new Snatcher game could be pretty cool.

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:50.000
So Snatcher was a text based adventure game.

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:58.000
I remember something about a year ago, maybe a few months ago, where folks were translating the second game in the series.

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:04.000
So yeah, Snatcher I guess has been dormant for a long time.

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:12.000
But I guess he tweeted something like, quote, I've readied a complete Snatcher set for some reason.

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:16.000
So I don't know, maybe people are taking that tweet very far.

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:22.000
And I also hate that Twitter is now becoming a respectable news source, but there you go.

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:25.000
Alright, anyhow, so that could be coming soon.

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:30.000
It would be kind of neat. I do remember the whole Kojima is working on something and maybe Snatcher would be it.

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:34.000
So we'll see.

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:38.000
Let's see, I guess ActDeft is tweeting us this.

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:42.000
Game Boy music video is exactly what it sounds like.

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:47.000
It's an article on Joystiq here that has a Game Boy, a bunch of Game Boys.

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:53.000
Let's see this.

01:34:53.000 --> 01:35:00.000
Oh, see, the reason why you're hearing all these hammering sounds and things is somebody actually clicking their Game Boy

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:04.000
and putting headphones into the slot, getting that humming noise and things like that.

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:08.000
I was thinking it was actually going to be like chiptunes.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:13.000
But no, this is somebody doing random things with an old-ass Game Boy.

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:16.000
That's pretty cool. It takes talent to put something like that together.

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
Neato.

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:23.000
Sonic has linked us to this. I believe this is also from Joystiq.

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:28.000
Except he just linked us to the picture. It has something to do with Child of Eden.

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
We didn't get actually linked to the article.

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:35.000
Yeah, Child of Eden seems cool. I'm actually really looking forward to that game.

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:40.000
Some folks that were playing it at PAX were really enjoying it too.

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:48.000
Remember, I don't know, they said it's going to support up to four controllers vibrating or something like that.

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
This is the corset, isn't it? Something about a corset.

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:51.000
Yes.

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:56.000
Oh, yes. I do remember reading about that. Awesome.

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:59.000
Let's get some more tweets. Gamer Girl tweets us saying,

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:04.000
Which do you think is better, Japanese versions of games or American versions of games?

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:05.000
That depends on the game.

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:10.000
Yeah, it's so wide open. It really depends on the game.

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:14.000
I mean, usually I like American versions of games because I can understand them,

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
because I don't speak Japanese.

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:21.000
But a lot of the old music games, especially back in the PlayStation 1 era, were way better in Japan.

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:24.000
Like, the Bust-A-Move series was better in Japan.

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:27.000
Most of the old DDR games were way better in Japan.

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:30.000
Like, DDR Third Mix on PlayStation 1 was the bomb.

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:35.000
But over here, we got, like, DDR USA Mix. Not so hot.

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:38.000
So yeah, it really depends on what game you're talking about.

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
So it's really wide open.

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:44.000
Blue Swim sends us some random tweets. I like these random tweets.

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:50.000
What was the first music album and first game soundtrack you bought?

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:55.000
The first game soundtrack I bought?

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
Uh...

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
That's a good question.

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:05.000
Ironically enough, it was probably DDR Third Mix for me.

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:12.000
Because, you know, I remember trying to get soundtracks online of, like, Final Fantasy VI,

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:15.000
and, like, the old school Final Fantasy games. Like, I was really into those musics.

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:19.000
But, you know, it was really hard to get music on CD back then over here.

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:22.000
So I would say you probably have to go back to when we first, you know,

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:26.000
were really starting to see more game soundtracks come out on CD in the CD gaming era.

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:30.000
And probably something like DDR Third Mix for me.

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:34.000
Well, I had, um, we had a bunch of, like, when I first moved in with Dan,

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:37.000
we had the TurboGrafx games that we could just, you know, play the CD.

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
Because they were Redbook Audio.

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:44.000
So, but, and I'll tell you what, actually I know the first one that I personally bought

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:49.000
that was not a bootleg.

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000
Because, you know, we used to get those all the time.

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:55.000
And this was, like, me personally buying it with my own money by myself going out,

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:58.000
not people sending me copies or anything or all that.

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:02.000
Is, um, I went out and bought the Bust A Move soundtrack right when it came out.

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:03.000
Oh nice.

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:07.000
They had the screensaver and everything built in with it and all the cool stuff.

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:13.000
And then, I actually, that's the first one that I personally went out to buy.

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:18.000
I mean, we found other ones. We've been given other ones, you know.

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:22.000
But that was the one I went out first on a mission to get.

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:26.000
Others, you know, we just sort of looked into or found or, you know, said,

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000
Oh, that's neat. Let's get it. You know.

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:29.000
Awesome.

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:35.000
And actually, there's been other, two others that I've bought the actual Japanese soundtracks for.

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:40.000
And that is Bust A Move 2, the dancing game, guys.

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:43.000
And Two Mix's Greatest Hits.

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:44.000
Nice.

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:48.000
Going to our chat room. I'm catching up on chat comments because I've been reading Twitter's.

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:51.000
SalaciousPop reminded me of something we saw the other day saying,

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:54.000
Zinga is now in the old Sega building in San Francisco.

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:57.000
True facts. Driving back from San Francisco the other day on Friday.

01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:00.000
Driving by the old Sega building. You know, you'd see that.

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
Like, drive coming off 280, going back onto 80.

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:05.000
You drive by that old Sega building. Yeah, Zinga's in there now.

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:06.000
Doesn't that make you sad?

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:07.000
That's crazy sad.

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:08.000
That's very sad.

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:11.000
Sj100Matt in our chat room says, No offense, but F-Snatcher.

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000
Zone of the Enders, please.

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
NacDeft follows up with that.

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:19.000
Where's my third Zone of the Enders, dammit?

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:20.000
Absolutely right.

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:25.000
Tigerclaw says, My first video game soundtrack, if you can call it that, is the Mortal Kombat CD.

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:29.000
And I'm not talking about the movie soundtrack, but the one by the Immortals.

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000
Oh god, I forgot about that disc.

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:34.000
Oh yeah, I had that too. I did have that.

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:37.000
That might have been my first one too.

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:38.000
I did have that.

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:41.000
I had the movie soundtrack too. The movie soundtrack was so awesome.

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:42.000
It was sick!

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:49.000
I think my first soundtrack was Gran Turismo and then I remember DDR Fourth Mix.

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:54.000
This is the other one I bought. I bought that at a con.

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:55.000
Awesome.

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
Last tweet from Blue Swim.

01:39:57.000 --> 01:40:01.000
If you could deep fry any candy bar, which one would it be?

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:05.000
Mmm, deep fried Milky Ways and Twix bars and Hershey's bars.

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:08.000
I've never had a deep fried candy bar, so I'm not sure how they taste.

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:09.000
I've had deep fried Snickers.

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:10.000
Is it good?

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
I could only eat half of it. It made me sick.

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
I know, it just sounds like too much.

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:17.000
I don't want any candy bar deep fried. I want them frozen.

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:21.000
I would say Almond Joy, because I like the Almond Joy a lot.

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:24.000
I like almond coconut stuff.

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:31.000
Not a big fan of candy bars, but if we got to pick something,

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:36.000
it's not really a candy bar, but it's what happens when you leave a bag of,

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:39.000
or I should say, let me correct this,

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:43.000
a three pound bag of gummy bears in your car during the hot summer.

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:46.000
It forms into a giant gummy pillow.

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:47.000
Mecha gummy.

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000
Mecha gummy, if you will.

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:56.000
Sort of a Tetsuo gone crazy mecha gummy or ultra gummy.

01:40:56.000 --> 01:41:03.000
Take that, bread that, and dip it in so you have a nice gooey pillow of fried gummy.

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000
Oh god, that sounds terrible.

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:09.000
And it's extremely dangerous because you'd be hot molten inside.

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000
You'd have to let that cool off a bit.

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000
Oh my god.

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:17.000
One time I remember Alan got these little, they were like those strawberry candies.

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:21.000
You ever those little strawberry puffy, strawberry puffs I think they're called.

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:25.000
But they were like Hello Kitty brand and they were so good.

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000
I want to deep fry those.

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:28.000
Deep fried Hello Kitty.

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:31.000
So much to deep fry nerds.

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000
Alright, that's it for Twitter topics.

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000
Bread every single one of them.

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:39.000
That's right, we're getting way off topic, but twitter.com slash o-l-r.

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000
Let's get back into some other gaming news.

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000
Loki.

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:49.000
Speaking of abominations coming to Facebook.

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:54.000
GameStop has decided, hey you know what, Facebook people are there.

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:58.000
So we're going to put a storefront there and we're going to sell shit there.

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:02.000
Because, you know, that's what we do.

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:08.000
Honestly, and this kind of even goes back to just Facebook as it is.

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:13.000
Liking stuff, you have to understand what liking something means.

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:16.000
Liking something means you're going to get spammed by them.

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:19.000
So, not us of course, we don't spam a lot.

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
I don't think we post a lot on Facebook anyways.

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:28.000
But, you know, when it comes to companies, you can guarantee that they're going to be spamming you with a bunch of shit.

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:35.000
So, liking GameStop, you better believe that they're going to be letting you know, hey, hey, there's a game pre-booking.

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000
You want to buy it?

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:42.000
Hey, hey, hey, listen, hey, maybe you should pre-order something.

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:46.000
You know, we got pre-orders. Come on in, pre-order things.

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:50.000
I hate going in there every time they're like, so what game are you looking forward to?

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:53.000
Because I know that's, so what game can I pre-order for you?

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:54.000
No.

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:57.000
And I tell them, I'm like, I'm not looking forward to anything.

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
I hate it all.

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:02.000
Why are you in here, dude?

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000
Because I'm buying something to come out.

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:12.000
I'm really at that point where, yeah, I just like to go to Best Buy or Fry's or some huge store that happens to have video games.

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000
You know what I mean?

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:17.000
Unless it's like some collector's edition that's super exclusive.

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000
You do not need to pre-order anything.

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000
You can find them in stores.

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:26.000
It's just like, you know, oh, you better pre-order that 3DS because you'll never be able to find it.

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
No, they're all over the fucking place.

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:32.000
It's just, just wait.

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000
Be a little patient.

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:39.000
I know that sounds really ridiculous coming from me, but seriously.

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:44.000
You, mister, I'm gonna pay 200 bucks for Motorstorm Apocalypse?

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:45.000
No.

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:46.000
Be patient?

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:49.000
No.

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:50.000
Huh?

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
It's a collector's item, okay?

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:53.000
Mm-hmm.

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:57.000
Mister, I'm gonna import my 3DS.

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:58.000
You know what?

01:43:58.000 --> 01:43:59.000
I actually-

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:00.000
I sold that, okay?

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:01.000
Oh, okay.

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:02.000
Did you make your money back?

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:03.000
Yes.

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:04.000
Wow, nice.

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000
So, I would say that that was awesome.

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:09.000
It was like renting a 3DS for a month.

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:12.000
Yeah, it worked out.

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:17.000
But yeah, I mean, so yeah, it's not a big surprise.

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:21.000
And of course, you know, they recently acquired Impulse and Spawn Labs.

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:30.000
So, they're trying to make, I guess, as much of, make themselves as much in your face as possible.

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:39.000
And I guess, yeah, you'll be able to purchase, reserve titles, view trailers, screenshots, and all that stuff.

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000
So, yeah.

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:42.000
Alright.

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:45.000
Well, Atari games are new all over again.

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:51.000
It seems like we have a story like this every year, because Atari games always seem to get re-released for some freaking console.

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:56.000
And this week, it's the iOS systems, the iPhone, the iPad, and so forth.

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:59.000
Atari's Greatest Hits was released this week.

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:03.000
And apparently, 100 games are available through this.

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000
Here's the deal.

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:09.000
You get a free shell of the game that comes with Pong for free just for downloading it,

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:14.000
which obviously is one of the big Atari games ever, although it hasn't aged well at all.

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:21.000
But you can pick up a variety of edition packs for 99 cents each.

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:24.000
And you can get extra games that come with them.

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:29.000
You can just buy all 100 freaking games for $14.99 if you want the old games.

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:35.000
Some of the games you can get, Tempest, Crystal Castles, Yars Revenge, Combat, and so forth.

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:40.000
Now, usually you kind of look at this and go, great, yay, it's the same thing all over again.

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:46.000
But one of the cool things that it does have, you can do multiplayer over Bluetooth connections.

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:47.000
So that's kind of cool.

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000
For some games.

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:50.000
Yeah, not everything.

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:53.000
But for some of the games, it has multiplayer over Bluetooth.

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:54.000
So that's kind of cool.

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:57.000
It's already more useful than Game Room.

01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.000
Sad.

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:05.000
Game Room could have been so good, but it's dead now.

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:10.000
They haven't officially canceled Game Room, but they also haven't put anything out for it since the end of last year.

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000
It's left as a graveyard.

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:17.000
I know. Sad face.

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:20.000
Well, how about something that's a little bit less than sad?

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:21.000
Okay.

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:22.000
Is it my turn?

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:27.000
Streets of Rage, also known as Bare Knuckle.

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000
It's getting a remake after eight years.

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:34.000
And it's, well, it was actually started by Bomber Games.

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:38.000
They started doing something called Streets of Rage remake in 2003.

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:42.000
And now they put out the final version as freeware on PC.

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:47.000
So maybe Sega's not upset about that.

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:52.000
But it's really not so much of a remake as much as a new game.

01:46:52.000 --> 01:47:02.000
It's using new code, has 103 stages, and playable characters from 1, 2, and 3 with new abilities and new characters.

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:09.000
There's new enemies based off of the Game Gear ones and cover illustrations are added on there.

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:17.000
There is boss rush, volleyball, AI partner mode, and other modes and a level editor.

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:23.000
So I'm watching a little bit of this and it just looks pretty neat.

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:28.000
There's a scene where you're outrunning a bulldozer and you have to fight walls.

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:31.000
And you can actually fight the bulldozer too.

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000
That's pretty funny.

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000
I want to fight a bulldozer, but not really.

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:40.000
You just kick the bulldozer and it goes backwards and then you go back to kicking the wall some more.

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000
And then the bulldozer knocks you over.

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000
Man vs. Bulldozer.

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000
Film 11.

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000
Awesome.

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:49.000
Kind of cool.

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:52.000
Damn those knee-high walls.

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:55.000
Oh, he's getting my way.

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:58.000
Someone driving a bulldozer through a building is what I want to know.

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000
I guess I'll have to play the game to find out.

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:03.000
Oh, I remembered a game I did play this week because it was on sale.

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:04.000
It was the X-Men arcade game.

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.000
I don't think I talked about this last week.

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:07.000
No, go ahead.

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000
Yeah, the X-Men arcade game.

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000
You know, better in my memories.

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:14.000
As sadly a lot of the retro classics end up being.

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:15.000
Not all of them though.

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000
Pitfall 2, still as awesome as I remember.

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:18.000
Just saying.

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:21.000
But some of the games were better in my memory.

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:22.000
Anyhow.

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:27.000
I'm kind of, well, actually I'm not too excited about Mortal Kombat.

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:32.000
But it is neat to see that there's some stuff coming to the 360 since the PlayStation 3 version

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000
does get, you know, Kratos.

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:39.000
The 360 though, and this is all considered to be rumor, although they do have some screenshots

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:42.000
that kind of confirm that.

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:49.000
It's supposed to be getting some exclusives, including a puzzle combat mode.

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:54.000
Also, a King of the Hill mode, which I guess will feature Avatar support.

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:57.000
How that works is beyond me.

01:48:57.000 --> 01:49:03.000
Also, an arena called the Pit 360, which is a remake of Mortal Kombat 3's The Pit 3.

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:08.000
And additionally, I guess they're saying that the DLC character Lady in Red will be offered

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:12.000
as a free download for Xbox Live users for a limited time.

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:20.000
Also, Mortal Kombat themed Avatar gear available for purchase on Xbox Live as well.

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:24.000
No confirmation on everything, but there are some screenshots that kind of show, you know,

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:28.000
the Pit and these Avatars watching the fight.

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:31.000
So it's a little interesting, I guess.

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:38.000
And then on top of that, you may remember the Mortal Kombat kind of pitch for, you know,

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:44.000
a new reimagining of the movie series, which I really wish would have happened, but it didn't.

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:48.000
But instead it became this now web series that's going to be going on.

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:52.000
And apparently the premiere of this web series is going to be on the 12th.

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000
That's right, on Tuesday.

01:49:54.000 --> 01:50:00.000
And you can check it out, the first episode of that, including, you know,

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:03.000
Michael Jai White's supposed to be in that still.

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:08.000
And it's going to have eight episodes, I guess, leading up to the April 19th launch day.

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:12.000
And yeah, you can check that out.

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:16.000
It's going to be on Makima.com at 4 p.m.

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:18.000
It's probably going to be really gross.

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000
I should show it to my mom so she can watch it.

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:23.000
This is gross, Rob. What are you making me watch? This is sick.

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:26.000
I think I would definitely want to check it out. It looked pretty cool.

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.000
Yeah, it does look pretty cool.

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:32.000
Again, can't explain it. I hate the Saw movies, yet I love Mortal Kombat even when it's gross.

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:36.000
But there'll probably be nothing as over-the-top as what you see in the game in these movies.

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:37.000
No.

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:40.000
I don't think I'm going to see Melina eating, like, ripping off someone's face and eating their tongue

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.000
and then spiking the head on the ground.

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:43.000
That'd be awesome.

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:46.000
I did get to see the subway fatality.

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:47.000
Oh yeah?

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:48.000
That's awesome.

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:53.000
It's like he holds her head on the subway so that their heads go through all the windows.

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:54.000
Oh yeah.

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000
And then he throws them in front of another train. It's awesome.

01:50:56.000 --> 01:51:02.000
You know what they should have done, which have been kind of fun as a parody of some of the other fighting game series?

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:08.000
Do Mortal Kombat Xtreme Beach Volleyball and actually have that where they take someone's head and spike it on the ground

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:12.000
and make it really ridiculously bloody.

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:15.000
Let's see. Let me look at this here real quick. Let's see if this is it.

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.000
Here we go. Here we go.

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:22.000
There you go.

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:25.000
And there it goes. Oncoming train.

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:28.000
That's awesome.

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:33.000
They showed a lot of... What I was looking at was the x-ray vision in the moves.

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:36.000
Yeah, those are like the special moves that you can do. It's pretty cool.

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:40.000
I don't know. I didn't like the demo at first, but it really started growing on me.

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:43.000
And I think the final game is going to do that too. So we'll see.

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:47.000
I'm going to definitely check that out when it comes out. Very cool.

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:51.000
Portal news. Because Portal 2 is on the way.

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:55.000
I was really shocked to see that this game is literally around the corner.

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:59.000
Speaking of this whole driving through San Francisco thing, they have a lot of video game billboards in San Francisco.

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:03.000
I don't know if you know this. I saw a Marvel vs. Capcom 3 billboard.

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:07.000
I saw a Super Street Fighter 3D... Super Street... Excuse me.

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:10.000
Street Fighter 4 3D.

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000
Super Street Fighter 4 3D.

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:15.000
Damn it. Whatever the fuck that game is. I saw a billboard for that too.

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:19.000
And then I saw a billboard for Portal 2 and it said the release date was April 9th.

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:22.000
And I kind of did that... Oh, holy shit. Or April 19th, excuse me.

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:25.000
I kind of did that whole, holy shit, that game is coming out really soon.

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.000
So I guess the billboard accomplished what it's supposed to do.

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:30.000
My birthday is April 19th, everybody.

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:36.000
Well, anyhow, to wrap up for your birthday dark soccer in anticipation of Portal 2,

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:40.000
there is a comic that's out now. Portal 2 Lab Rat.

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000
That's right. It's a comic that you can read through.

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:48.000
It's on IGN Comics at comics.ign.com and you can check that out.

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000
It's a free comic, so if you want to read that.

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.000
Maybe that's something you can talk about on Comic Insanity.

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:56.000
I don't know if you do the whole virtual comics, but Portal 2 might be a good excuse.

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:57.000
Yeah.

01:52:57.000 --> 01:53:04.000
Also of note, Joko, Jonathan Coulton, of course doing the music for Portal 2, I believe.

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.000
He's contributing to that as well, right?

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.000
Didn't I use something? He's doing some of that.

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:14.000
Well, there is a new version of Portals Still Alive that's going to be coming out.

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:20.000
I don't know if this is with regards to Portal 2 or what, but this is coming out through Twitter.

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:28.000
I guess it's Jonathan Coulton and They Might Be Giants because John Flassenburg from They Might Be Giants,

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:31.000
he's producing Jonathan Coulton's upcoming album.

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:35.000
And I guess one of the tracks they're doing for this album is a new version of Still Alive.

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:40.000
And it's going to feature Sarah Quinn. She's from Tegan and Sarah, so she'll be in this new one.

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:42.000
That's pretty cool. I really like Tegan and Sarah.

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:45.000
They do a great live show because they like to tell stories.

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:49.000
I like going to concerts where they actually talk and interact with the audience.

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:51.000
And Tegan and Sarah do this better than anyone else I've seen.

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:57.000
Like Britney Spears, I don't get her concerts because all she does, she just comes out from the stage,

01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:59.000
parades around and lip syncs for two hours.

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:02.000
She might say, hey, Sacramento, and then that's it.

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.000
She parades back to her five-star hotel.

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000
There's something else super cool in this, Rob.

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:07.000
What else do you want to say?

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:08.000
Theremin!

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.000
That's right. There's a Theremin solo on the new album.

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:12.000
Woo! Theremin!

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:16.000
Unfortunately, the new album isn't due out until 2013.

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:18.000
So this will be a little bit of a wait.

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:21.000
So I guess maybe this new track isn't for Portal 2.

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:23.000
Sad face.

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:26.000
I'm sure there'll be some new song from the game, though. Everybody's all crazy. Over.

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:29.000
Theremin!

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:30.000
Awesome.

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:36.000
Maybe something with Cave Johnson singing the new character that's in the game.

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:40.000
The CEO of Aperture Science or something like that.

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:45.000
Which, by the way, speaking of your rant earlier, did you notice there's some bonus from getting it at GameStop?

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:47.000
There's some unlockable character.

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:52.000
Yeah, no, I've seen the commercials. It's not even an unlockable character. It's a skin for your character.

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:59.000
Seriously, people, if you're all getting raging boners over a fucking skin, I'm sorry.

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:03.000
But the pre-order bonuses for stuff nowadays are really kind of terrible.

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:09.000
Like, you know, oh, you get this. Instead of the gun being silver, it's gold now.

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.000
Whoa!

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:15.000
Gold. That way all my friends know I'm a consumer whore.

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.000
It's an E-peen something. I have something you don't have.

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:22.000
No, it's not something that you don't have, because everybody's ordering at the same place, so they're all gonna have it.

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:25.000
Okay, so I was watching South Park the other day randomly.

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:28.000
It was on TV, and there was a commercial for the new Mortal Kombat.

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:35.000
And it was a commercial for people at GameStop to get the new Mortal Kombat because you get the Scorpion skin, the classic Scorpion skin with it.

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:38.000
And they did this whole Mashima thing with it, which was kind of funny.

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000
Yeah, they've been doing that now.

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:46.000
But what I thought was interesting about it is that Mileena was not wearing the costume that she has in the demo.

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:49.000
She was wearing classic Mileena outfits.

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:53.000
So classic Scorpion outfit is not gonna be the only classic outfit that shows up in the game.

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:55.000
Yes, there's a ton of them.

01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:57.000
Are they all gonna be download content, though?

01:55:57.000 --> 01:56:03.000
No, some of them I think actually came with the... I think some come with the game.

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:06.000
Like, there may be, like, a code to download one of them.

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:11.000
But they're gonna be offered later on as, you know, from what I've seen in places.

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:12.000
That's cool, yes.

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:14.000
Yes, there's plenty of skins coming.

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:19.000
But the new Mileena shows way more boobies than the old one did.

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:23.000
And with all the gross stuff that goes on in the game, she's, like, smearing blood on her boobies.

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:28.000
That's gross, but funny. That's Mortal Kombat. Mortal Kombat is funny.

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:31.000
Speaking of hilarious, let's go to the email bag.

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.000
Every week, you guys send us emails.

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:37.000
Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and the hilarity ensues.

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:40.000
DarkSakura, stop shopping on Steam.

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:42.000
I'm not stopping.

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:44.000
I'll never stop.

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:46.000
I'll never stop shopping.

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.000
Shopping's actually good for you. Did you know that?

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:49.000
It's very therapeutic.

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:50.000
No, it's not.

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:54.000
Whenever I get pissed off, I go to the outlets. It's been $300. I feel much better.

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.000
First email.

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:59.000
It says, hello, O.L.R. Great show.

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:01.000
I wanted to give you guys a heads up on the following.

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:04.000
The Streets of Rage remake project.

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:06.000
Yeah, we just covered this.

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:09.000
It is an 8-year-old fan project by some very talented guys from Spain.

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:13.000
The graphics are all redrawn, levels were upgraded or extended, and music got remixed.

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:16.000
The remake is free. I'm not affiliated with these people.

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:20.000
But he sent the link to it, so I figured I would link it in the chatroom.

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.000
Thank you, Carlos.

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:27.000
Well, there you go. Another endorsement for that project that folks have been eagerly anticipating.

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:30.000
Yep. And I just linked it.

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:34.000
So, we only got one other email.

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:38.000
Hi, O.L.R. I think this is from Spazinator.

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:42.000
Since he's banned from Twitter, he's turned to the email bag.

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:49.000
I just wanted to point out a couple of relatively minor stories for the three of you.

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:55.000
First, there are four new free TV shows, all of which are available on both PSN as well as Xbox Live's Zune Marketplace.

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:59.000
Finding them is just a matter of looking under the free TV tabs on their respective systems.

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:05.000
The second story, or should I say non-story, I don't know, is that the PlayStation Network has been relatively severe-

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:11.000
was having relatively severe issues this past Tuesday, while Sony has indeed acknowledged that there was an issue

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:14.000
by issuing a statement via the U.S. PlayStation blog.

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:17.000
They have remained rather tight-lipped about the cause of the issue.

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:23.000
However, it's commonly believed that the issues with PSN were caused by a DDoS attack by a group called Anonymous, which we covered.

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:30.000
I don't think that's- well, you know, to be fair, these emails come in during the week, but I don't think it's really, like, rumor.

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:33.000
I'm pretty sure it's been confirmed. They did it. They took credit.

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:37.000
Supposedly they're upset over the fact that Sony is taking GeoHot to court. Yes.

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:41.000
If I know Loki as well as I think I do, I'll beat him to the proverbial punch and say this,

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:48.000
Somebody call the WAM-bulance. Oh no, Sony is protecting their interest in suing a hacker. Waaah, I show them.

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:53.000
Okay, that wasn't quite a Loki rant, but it was a reasonable approximation. I don't think so.

01:58:53.000 --> 01:59:01.000
Uh, well, there's a problem with your argument, the problem being that he's not- he's hacking hardware that he owns.

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:10.000
He's basically, you know, allowing himself to be able to run Linux again, or allowing himself to, you know, hack stuff.

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:16.000
He's not hacking the PlayStation Network. It would be like, for example, I guess you could use the same argument that,

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:26.000
Say you made a custom wallpaper or something like that for your Xbox 360, and then you popped it, you, you know, hacked it into your system so that you have a custom wallpaper,

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:33.000
And then Sony- or Microsoft comes and sues you because you did that. It's basically that. The whole argument is that,

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:41.000
Sony's coming after him for hacking his own hardware that he had, because they're saying that they own the system still.

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:50.000
Yeah. Um, to continue, side note, I have no way to verify this either way, but supposedly anonymous has issued a statement,

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:58.000
Which I will paraphrase. We wholeheartedly believe in Geohot's cause and believe he is unjustly be persecuted.

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:03.000
We will fight for you until Sony relents. We will never give you up. We will never let you down. We will never run around and desert you.

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:10.000
Okay, last part was BS. That was a variation of a 4chan joke, where a discussion morphs from one topic to quoting Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:17.000
Just that I submitted Rick Astley for Fresh Prince. This email was brought to you by Old Ass Jokes. That's it.

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:25.000
Alright. That does it for emails. Unfortunately, both about topics we already covered on the show tonight,

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:30.000
But hey, it's where every gamer has a voice, so send in your voices. Chances are though, if it's a big news story,

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:34.000
We're probably gonna hit it at some point. You know, it is a 3 hour show. Just for the record.

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:39.000
So if you're gonna email us, and that's okay, don't let that discourage you from emailing us about a big topic, a news story,

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:43.000
But just tell us, what are your thoughts? Are you excited? Are you happy? Are you sad? Are you mad?

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:50.000
You know, tell us what you think about it. Alright. Let's see. Let's go on to the FUs of the week.

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:53.000
Every week we like to get angsty. So let's do that right now.

02:00:53.000 --> 02:01:17.000
FU to my semi OCD habit of every time I get a harebrained idea, I research the crap out of it to make sure it's possible.

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:29.000
And then probably don't end up doing it. This I will do. It will be done. And also an FU to lack of communication. Done.

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:48.000
I hate doing this. I'm so sad about it. But FU to the squeeze in. And the reason why is because I've been looking forward to for years trying to squeeze with cheese,

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:55.000
And just, you know, it looks so delicious on TV and stuff like that. I finally went to the one that they just put in in Roseville.

02:01:55.000 --> 02:02:08.000
And I gotta say, that burger was fucking terrible. The cheese tasted awful. The burger had no flavor to it. It was kind of burnt tasting, the cheese.

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:18.000
It was like basically having the most beautiful woman that you've ever seen describe how she's just going to make you, and you would be a virgin of course,

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:25.000
Have the most amazing orgasm possible, and basically describing in great detail what she's going to do.

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:26.000
Good luck with that, Hunter.

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:35.000
Has you close your eyes, and then you get knocked out, left in the desert to die without any legs. That's basically what this was about.

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:42.000
It's like, huh, I wasn't expecting that. That's basically, uh, Smash, or not Smash Bros.

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:45.000
Oops, why is the outro to the show playing? My bad.

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:51.000
It's basically, I mean, it was such a disappointment. I don't understand the draw to it at all.

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:57.000
Maybe it was a bad burr or something, but, you know, everybody else seemed happy about it.

02:02:57.000 --> 02:03:06.000
I could do better myself, man. I mean, if all it is is putting a lot of cheese on something. Fuck, dude, I can put a lot of cheese on something.

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:17.000
Uh, my FU of the Week, wait, where'd the FU music go? There we go, thank you. Uh, my FU of the Week would go to, um, probably moving.

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:23.000
I mean, like, don't get me wrong, I'm really happy to be moving, and the new place has so much more space than my old place did, so that's really good.

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:30.000
Because I have a lot of shit, but my FU goes to having to move that shit is really a pain in the big fat ass.

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:32.000
You still have to move far.

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:38.000
Yeah, but it's, you still have to load up a truck and take it to the other end of the complex, so, it's not that bad.

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:44.000
It's just that you have to clean the old place, and that's just a pain. It's a pain, and I'm lazy.

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:45.000
Close it with fire.

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:51.000
Lazy people don't like moving. I'm gonna do what I did next time I'm hiring movers again.

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:58.000
When I hired movers last time, it was great. Except for the whole stuff that they weren't able to move, but, anyhow.

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:06.000
Let's move on, shall we? Couple more news stories for you guys, and then, oh god, it's the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:15.000
Uh, yes, another week, another class action lawsuit. This time, it's towards EA, and I could've sworn that this hasn't been the first one, but,

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:24.000
apparently there is the, um, Madden lawsuit, and it's, um, this time, it's not even necessarily just Madden, but it's EA Sports.

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:35.000
Madden NCAA and Arena Football. Um, apparently that there is a case, uh, Pickover vs. Electronic Arts, Inc.

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:41.000
saying that EA's exclusive licenses foreclosed competition in an alleged football video game market.

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:47.000
Because of the lack of competition, the plaintiffs in the case claimed that this monopoly allowed EA to overcharge for its games,

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:52.000
even though EA Sports games, of course, cost as much as, you know, all the other console games out there.

02:04:52.000 --> 02:05:04.000
Um, so, if you're interested in possibly participating in this, you can go to easportslitigation.com, and check out the information regarding that.

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:12.000
Apparently, this would qualify if you bought a game between, or an EA Sports football game, uh, between 2005 and now.

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:22.000
Yeah, XLink was telling me about this, because I guess he got an email about it on WoW, and there was a part of me that was kind of like,

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:24.000
is this like a phishing thing, or is this, now I guess it is a real deal.

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:25.000
No, it's real.

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:26.000
Class action lawsuit.

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:33.000
You know, they give the options, you know, you can remain a class member, and it says you need, you do not need to take any further action at this time,

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:40.000
you'll automatically remain a class member, and, uh, or you can exclude yourself, and do all that stuff.

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:47.000
It's, I've seen this a lot, like, I got one from 24 Hour Fitness one time, and I got like, it was crap, it was like,

02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:50.000
ooh, you get three weeks free, it's like, I don't want to go back there.

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:52.000
Whoops, excuse me.

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:58.000
I'm having a lot of technical fail tonight, I apologize for that.

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:03.000
Well, I'm surprised, Rob, this episode's supposed to be squeaky clean.

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:06.000
I know, it's 4-9, it's really broken and dirty.

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:09.000
Alright, well since I already played a part of it, let me play it here.

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:14.000
I had no idea this was, uh, in the DVD, is this in the Tron Legacy DVD?

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:21.000
There's an ad for the new Commodore 64, I guess, that is coming out, because it's this whole Tron thing,

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:28.000
it talks about, you know, more colors and better sound and so forth, and then all of a sudden...

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:30.000
I didn't see that.

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:33.000
And we watched, like, a bunch of stuff.

02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:37.000
And there's a whole Commodore computer coming out.

02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:43.000
Now, we talked about this on the show before, that the Commodore 64 is being rebooted.

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:46.000
Maybe that was something special they did for you, I don't know.

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:48.000
It's probably like a TV commercial or something.

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:50.000
Perhaps, but this is still awesome.

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:52.000
CommodoreUSA.net, if you want to get it.

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:54.000
They are Commodore PCs.

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:58.000
The Commodore 64, the pricing is announced, that's what's made these big.

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:01.000
The Commodore 64 is going to start at $595 US dollars,

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:08.000
the VIC Pro will be $895 US dollars, and the VIC Slim will be $395 US dollars.

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:11.000
Now, it doesn't quite say exactly what all is coming with these.

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:13.000
Let me see if the website has more details on this.

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:18.000
It's an Intel Atom processor, so think Netbook.

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:21.000
Aw, that kind of sucks, if that's the case.

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:23.000
Okay, yay, you're showing me the damn preview again.

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:25.000
Let me see here, let me go to the site.

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:32.000
Think Netbook and think, you know, it's going to have an emulator for Commodore games on there.

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:37.000
Let's see, the classic recreated Commodore 64, one 12 volt DC jack,

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:44.000
one PS2 keyboard mouse connectors, one HDMI, one DVI-D, one VGA, four USB slots.

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:46.000
Go to the tech configurations.

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:51.000
Let's see, technology, processor, Intel Atom, oh boy.

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:53.000
What's 1.8 gigahertz?

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:58.000
I can guarantee you right there, those boards, because they're all integrated boards,

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:03.000
they go for about maybe $200 at the most.

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:06.000
That sucks, because I'll tell you what, I'm not even going to lie,

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:09.000
I really want one of these, because I love my Commodore 64,

02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:12.000
and this is what they're selling it on to.

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:14.000
You can seriously build one of those cheaper than that.

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:16.000
I know, I know.

02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:22.000
Yeah, the Realtek audio that's built in, the Ethernet's all built into the stupid board.

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:29.000
Do they even include anything else other than how much RAM was in it again?

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:33.000
Two DDR2s up to four gigs.

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:36.000
Two single channel slots, yeah.

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:42.000
DDR2, old slow ass RAM compared to nowadays stuff.

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:47.000
Let me see what's in that VIC Pro, because I guess there's the VIC Pro that's coming out as well.

02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:49.000
See, but this doesn't have that same nostalgia factor for me.

02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:54.000
See, that's a little bit different though. See, this one actually has a dual or quad core processor built into it.

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:57.000
So, that's a little bit better.

02:08:57.000 --> 02:08:59.000
Intel dual or quad.

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:03.000
How big was the Commodore 64 keyboard? Was that pretty big?

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:07.000
Well, they were monsters because the computer was inside the keyboard.

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:09.000
So they were pretty big keyboards.

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:12.000
I don't understand why they can't fit a bigger, better computer in there.

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:14.000
Well, it's probably the price.

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:18.000
They're trying to, obviously they want to profit off these.

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:22.000
Yeah, but I mean, hell, when I was building my MAME cabinet stuff,

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:25.000
I mean, they're like dual core Intel chips.

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:33.000
It's like dual core 2.8 gigahertz chips with 2 gigs of RAM and decent hard drive and stuff.

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:35.000
And I built those under $200.

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:38.000
So, they can't do that?

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:43.000
I mean, and that's, you know, hell, you could probably find that stuff even cheaper.

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:49.000
Especially if you're like Commodore or somebody making a massive amount of computers.

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:53.000
I mean, you're not just a consumer like myself.

02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:55.000
I don't know.

02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:58.000
But, yeah, whatever. You're paying for nostalgia.

02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:01.000
Maybe licensing for Commodore.

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:02.000
Alright.

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:05.000
Maybe having to remake those computers.

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:07.000
Well, probably it's nostalgia.

02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:09.000
It's the original emulator.

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:11.000
They're trying to get some value out of that too.

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:13.000
You know, obviously they want to make a profit off it,

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:22.000
but they want to cash in on old folks like me who have the nostalgia going with the Commodore 64.

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:23.000
That's what it is.

02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:24.000
Alright, let's go to the Skype line.

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:26.000
Every week we open up the Skype line.

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:32.000
Take your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR or use the name on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:34.000
The Skype line is open now.

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:37.000
We're going to have to wait a minute and a half for the chat room to hear that.

02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:40.000
Well, we could also post in the chat room.

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:41.000
I'm going to do that right now.

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:42.000
Send call now.

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:43.000
Yeah.

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:46.000
Loki, go ahead and read us some last minute stories while I post that.

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:50.000
Sony has thought of a great idea for the PlayStation Move.

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:52.000
Hey, you know what sells more Move?

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:53.000
More iPad.

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:54.000
That's right.

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:57.000
There's an iPad sequel coming out because, you know, the first one wasn't terrible enough.

02:10:57.000 --> 02:11:01.000
So this iPad sequel comes with Friends.

02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:05.000
That's where you'll be able to have two players and two iPads at the same time.

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:08.000
You can be able to create your own content as well.

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:13.000
They're saying that, I guess, you can either raise one up by itself or raise them as a pair.

02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:15.000
I mean, I'm sorry.

02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:21.000
It was a neat idea at first when it was supposed to be for the PlayStation Eye, but it was pretty terrible when it came out.

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:25.000
I can't be too excited about that, unfortunately.

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:28.000
And then this is kind of interesting.

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:34.000
Remember how the PlayStation 1 emulator got removed from the Android Marketplace?

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:37.000
Well, not to be outdone by that.

02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:45.000
The PSX for Droid application is back, and actually it's available now from the developer's website.

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:52.000
It says the original Sony complaint only had to do with the trademark logo that he had put on the app's icon.

02:11:52.000 --> 02:12:02.000
But since then, I guess, Google has closed both his Android Market and Checkout accounts, so he's leaving him unable to publish any apps.

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:04.000
So he's self-publishing the app now.

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:15.000
So if you want to download the free app and then go find your ISOs, you can do that and avoid paying $7 per PlayStation 1 game.

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:18.000
God, I love that stuff.

02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:20.000
And then finally, this is kind of cool.

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:24.000
Well, Evil Dead, they're making a game now for the iPhone and iPad.

02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:28.000
It's going to be a 3D action shooter.

02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:35.000
It's supposed to be coming out very soon, and it kind of features these chibi characters.

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:49.000
Chibi, Bruce Campbell, and it's supposed to be out for, I guess, $2.99 on the iPhone, $4.99 on the iPad, and 30 chapters, and I guess lots of stuff.

02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:53.000
It looked like the movie, but very chibi.

02:12:53.000 --> 02:13:07.000
And then I guess it's being developed by Trigger Apps, who's made a bunch of different movie-based games for the iPhone and Android, including The Karate Kid, Green Hornet, G.I. Joe, and Couples Retreat.

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:10.000
That Couples Retreat looked like a terrible movie.

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:11.000
No, it looks really terrible.

02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:12.000
What's that?

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:13.000
The Guvenator.

02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:15.000
Oh, God.

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:16.000
Seriously.

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:19.000
I saw you post that story, and I was like, no, we're not covering that.

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:21.000
I guess we are now, but that's alright.

02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:23.000
It looks so terrible.

02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:25.000
Why would you, why would they do this?

02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:27.000
Apparently, Stan Lee is putting out a comic.

02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:31.000
I guess Stan Lee has no cred anymore, because he's putting out the Guvenator now.

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:33.000
Way to ruin your reputation there, bud.

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:43.000
So they put out a comic, and of course they're doing a cartoon series, and apparently that cartoon series is going to become a movie, and possibly a game.

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:49.000
And Arnold Schwarzenegger is doing The Voice, and I don't get it.

02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:50.000
It looks stupid.

02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:52.000
It looks so cheesy.

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:56.000
But that's what they're doing.

02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:59.000
That's the best idea.

02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:05.000
Gosh, our Skype line is really lagged tonight, and it's making me sad, but we're talking in the chat room about Commodore 64.

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:12.000
Because Ziba in our chat room is saying, you know, it just emulates the games, and there's nothing like having an original Commodore 64 play the games.

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:13.000
I'm like, you know what, you're right.

02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:16.000
I need to just go find an original Commodore 64 that still works.

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:18.000
There might be one in my parents' garage, actually.

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:20.000
I don't know if the damn thing would still work.

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:24.000
But yeah, it just had me reminiscing.

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:29.000
Seriously, I want to go back and play Dragon's Lair 2 on the Commodore 64 so bad.

02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:32.000
It's one of my favorite soundtracks ever, and I know I've brought this up on the show before.

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:36.000
But it was not the actual Dragon's Lair 2 that was the arcade game.

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:38.000
This was called Escape from Singe's Castle.

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:45.000
I think I brought this up when Dark Sakura did this as the classic game of the week once, but one of my favorite soundtracks ever on the Commodore 64.

02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:49.000
It was Escape from Singe's Castle. It was like the second half of the scenes.

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:56.000
But the thing about the Commodore 64 version of Dragon's Lair is that it wasn't, like they couldn't make the laserdisc, obviously.

02:14:56.000 --> 02:15:00.000
So they had to make little mini-games out of all the scenes.

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:07.000
So like this one was a rowing game where you had to push the joystick in the direction that the tide was going.

02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:09.000
So it was like a reaction type thing.

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:15.000
But then one of the coolest stages, the coolest music is the, um, yes, this one with the balls in the tunnel.

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:24.000
And he had to jump over the holes in the floor.

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:26.000
And he had to, it was a very tricky balance.

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:28.000
You can see how he keeps moving forward slightly.

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:31.000
It's because if you let it keep going, he'll just fall off the back.

02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:33.000
And he slips and falls.

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:38.000
And then there's some random scenes that are inspired by the actual arcade game.

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:40.000
Let me see if I can get to one of those.

02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:45.000
See like this is, the hand's coming up so he has to jump left. Things like that.

02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:50.000
This arcade, this was like one of my favorite Commodore 64 games. It was so awesome.

02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:54.000
Anyhow, just taking a trip down memory lane. That's all.

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:56.000
Any other last minute stories while no one calls?

02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:57.000
Um, yeah.

02:15:57.000 --> 02:15:58.000
I like to party.

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:05.000
There's a new, um, new indie game coming out on the Xbox marketplace called Avatar Legends.

02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:10.000
It's going to be a role playing game, I guess by the developer Barker's Crest.

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:13.000
And it actually looks kind of cool.

02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:17.000
It's going to be a 10 hour single player game. Co-op and multiplayer for up to six people.

02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:19.000
A level and quest editor.

02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:21.000
And you can create missions to share with your friends.

02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:24.000
But you also, you play as your avatar.

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:26.000
And you actually get full control over them and stuff.

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:27.000
So that kind of looks neat.

02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:38.000
And, um, I guess this says you can even drop people from your friends list into the game's NPC and set up, I guess, like different multiplayer and stuff.

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:42.000
Who the hell's calling me? Who's calling you? Don't they know you have a show?

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:43.000
Unless it's the wife.

02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:44.000
My wife.

02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:45.000
Uh oh.

02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:50.000
Alright, so Loki's taking a phone call. And we're not. So...

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:53.000
I'm going to the Mii festival on Saturday.

02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:54.000
What's the Mii festival?

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:55.000
Sakura Matsuri.

02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:57.000
Ah, what goes on at the Sakura Matsuri festival?

02:16:57.000 --> 02:16:59.000
It's where everyone has a parade in my honor.

02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:00.000
Oh really?

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:01.000
Yeah, not really.

02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:02.000
No, I don't think that's why they're doing the parade.

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:07.000
It's because the cherry blossoms are in bloom.

02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:09.000
Okay, is everything okay?

02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:11.000
Yeah, apparently. She's like, I'm going to call you back and leave a message.

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:13.000
Oh, okay. Phew.

02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:18.000
I thought, she's never called during the show before. And I was like, oh, emergency. So, but I guess it's not that bad.

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:21.000
Oh no, the baby have started to move.

02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:25.000
That could be it. Maybe the baby's getting a little more mobile. Who knows?

02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:27.000
How are things going with the baby?

02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:32.000
Uh, he's doing okay. He's wiggly.

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:41.000
Wants to roll around and not sleep. And he acts like he's teething, but there's nothing really coming in.

02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:44.000
So, I don't know. We took him to the park today.

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:48.000
And uh, that's pretty much it.

02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:53.000
Alright, we're finally getting some calls. Let's go to the phone and take them. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:55.000
Hi, guys. This is DDR.Bill.

02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:59.000
Wow, he's really quiet. Is it just, let me check your levels. I don't know if it's just here in the studio.

02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:01.000
How are you doing, DDR.Bill?

02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:04.000
Oh, doing alright. Just figured I'd give a call and say hi.

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:10.000
Hi. You are kind of quiet, but I think we can deal. You're not like, unhearable. What's up? What's on your mind?

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:20.000
Uh, nothing. I was trying to find a topic to talk about because I didn't want to call and turn into a bitchfest about Killer Instinct because I absolutely hated that game with that furious passion.

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:26.000
Hey, you know what? It's where every gamer has a voice, so some of us like Killer Instinct. Why do you hate Killer Instinct?

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:42.000
This was back when I started developing a real hatred of fighting games, especially with something like Killer Instinct where it was just memorizing bullshit amount of combos to the point of where my physics exam was easier than Killer Instinct.

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:57.000
But what about the whole, and I don't know if this is just Killer Instinct 2, but I thought Killer Instinct 1 had this too, where if you kind of just knew like the basics, like you know, the cross, the X pattern, and you know, you could do some pretty decent combos just knowing the patterns.

02:18:57.000 --> 02:19:04.000
Like it wasn't like Mortal Kombat, dude. Like Mortal Kombat 3, you really had to memorize combos in order to get through that game. You know what I mean?

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:15.000
Like it was to the point where when I fired up Mortal Kombat 3 on Xbox last week, I still remembered like a seven-hit cabal combo just because I had to memorize it like 10 years ago, you know?

02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:22.000
Yeah, for Mortal Kombat 3, I'll agree with that because I've only memorized one character, and that was Sindel.

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:31.000
Dude, Sindel was awesome. Yes, it was like low kick, low kick, high punch, high punch, uppercut. Yeah, I used to know all the stuff for Sindel too. She was awesome.

02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:35.000
Yeah, and that was the only count I played. I was like, eh, whatever.

02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:44.000
They had some really dopey fatalities in Mortal Kombat 3 though. Like it wasn't one of her fatalities where like she whips them in her, like she literally whips her hair back and forth.

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:54.000
Like she whips them up in a little like ice cream cone looking thing and then whips her hair back and it just, it unravels the body and all the bones go flying. Like it's really stupid.

02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:57.000
Like Mortal Kombat 3 was when it got really cartoony, you know what I mean?

02:19:57.000 --> 02:20:03.000
Yeah, especially when her second one was when she screamed and your skin just came off. I was like, okay.

02:20:03.000 --> 02:20:05.000
Yeah, yeah.

02:20:05.000 --> 02:20:11.000
Yeah, but there's also, the thing also was that this came out also the same time around as the Virtua Fighter series coming out.

02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:22.000
And Virtua Fighter, what I loved about that over things like Killer Instinct and even Street Fighter was it just felt more natural to play. Like it just, everything felt better at the time.

02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:33.000
Like I really felt like I was actually, for the time I felt like, oh wow, my moves actually carried out. It made sense, not just memorizing combos and X, Y, Z, magic pattern, whatever.

02:20:33.000 --> 02:20:34.000
Right.

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:38.000
You know, that's why I kind of had a really big dislike for it.

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:47.000
That and I got into a fistfight over some jackass in my college who, there was a whole stupid argument about it and I ended up punching him.

02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:49.000
You got into a fistfight over this?

02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:56.000
Yeah, cause he was like, he got to remember also that this kid was acting all bullshit gangster.

02:20:56.000 --> 02:20:58.000
In other words, he had it coming.

02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:03.000
I was like shut up and back and forth and then she just like punched him and walked away.

02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:09.000
Wow, have you ever gotten in a physical altercation over a video game? Dark Soccer, have you ever punched some bitch over a video game?

02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:11.000
I punched my brother.

02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:12.000
Did you really?

02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:17.000
Yeah, cause we were playing Super Street Fighter IV, not four, why am I saying four, Super Street Fighter II.

02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:24.000
When my brothers were still younger and he totally, totally, totally tried to grab my controller so I punched him.

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:25.000
Wow.

02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:26.000
Oh damn.

02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:29.000
Well you know, it's the bitch let go of my controller.

02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:33.000
But you've never punched another girl over a video game?

02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:35.000
I didn't know any other girls that played.

02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:38.000
And then you hit them with pillows and then rub your boobies together.

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:41.000
No, I always played with dudes.

02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:42.000
Oh okay.

02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:43.000
But I punched them too.

02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:45.000
And they thought it was funny.

02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:51.000
I've always thought my coworkers are gonna do that to me during Grand Theft Auto cause I really piss them off when I play with them.

02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:52.000
But uh, no.

02:21:52.000 --> 02:22:00.000
Yeah, I don't think I've ever gotten in a physical altercation over a video game. Like I think, you know, I've thrown controllers and I've probably thrown controllers at people.

02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:02.000
Well my mother tried to take away my Nintendo once.

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:03.000
Oh god, I love this story.

02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:10.000
And then she was gonna, gonna spank me because I uh, I got it out of the closet until I reminded her that she didn't buy it for me and that it was theft.

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:11.000
Whoops.

02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:14.000
I was, no, I was seriously a little hellion.

02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:16.000
Mother, there is condensation on the window.

02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:18.000
That's my favorite story your mother told.

02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:20.000
When I was three.

02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:23.000
I just had a good vocabulary.

02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:24.000
Okay.

02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:26.000
So did I. I don't feel bad.

02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:28.000
Sorry, I think we got off track a little bit DDR dollar bill.

02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:32.000
Somehow we went to fist fight to condensation on the windows. That's okay.

02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:33.000
It's alright.

02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:40.000
And then the second thing also what got me, what I also wanted to talk about was that you were talking about the love of Commodore 64 games.

02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:41.000
Yes.

02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:51.000
That actually what got me started into emulation because I never actually played a Commodore until they actually started emulating the games, you know, I'd say the mid 90s.

02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:52.000
Mmhmm.

02:22:52.000 --> 02:23:01.000
And that's when I really started getting into it and the strangest thing was I actually was collecting magazines from England about Commodore games.

02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:08.000
Well cause the Commodore 64 was huge over there. I mean I would like to think it was pretty big in the US but it was huge in the UK. Huge.

02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:14.000
Oh definitely. The two magazines were The Games Machine and Zzap! 64.

02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:15.000
Mmhmm.

02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:25.000
And it was through those magazines that I actually downloaded a few games and that's when I found two of my all time favorite freaking soundtracks as you were saying.

02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:32.000
Like you said Dragon Slayer Escape Ninja Slave was a good soundtrack and I'm agreeing with that one. It was really cool.

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:33.000
Uh huh. What else though?

02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:36.000
But my favorite all time? Last Ninja 2.

02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:41.000
Dude the last Ninja, those were some awesome games. Yeah.

02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:42.000
Yeah.

02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:43.000
Absolutely.

02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:45.000
The second one though the music was just oh my god phenomenal.

02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:54.000
Let's see if we can get some of the music here from this game. I don't know if we, this is some game play video so I don't know how much, I can't remember how much soundtrack was in the actual game. Let's see if we can get to here.

02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:58.000
The first one was my favorite, Central Park, the first level. That was really good.

02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:01.000
Okay let's see what we can do here.

02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:05.000
Trying to play some of the music here from it.

02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:09.000
Nah this thing's like muted or something.

02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:10.000
Oh damn.

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:14.000
Well there's Amiga, let's see this Amiga version here. Let's see.

02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:23.000
That's a different, that sounds a lot different.

02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:27.000
Yeah that's the Amiga version. Hold on let me see if we have the Commodore 64 one.

02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:29.000
Commodore 64 long play part one.

02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:31.000
Here we go.

02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:37.000
Ah yes, this is what I remember too.

02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:40.000
Let's fast forward a little bit.

02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:48.000
There's like a whole cinematic opening.

02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:50.000
Oh this is The Last Ninja 3. My bad.

02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:55.000
Oh, I'm trying to be actually. I'm trying one too.

02:24:55.000 --> 02:24:58.000
Same type of thing though. Yeah they all had epic soundtracks though.

02:24:58.000 --> 02:24:59.000
Oh definitely.

02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:00.000
Awesome.

02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:04.000
I actually grabbed someone, there was a group, I think it was Puffy64.

02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:10.000
That actually remixed the soundtrack from the second one and added some rock in it.

02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:13.000
I was like, I used that as my wrestling theme now for SmackDown vs Raw.

02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:18.000
So you said there's one other Commodore 64 game you had a great soundtrack?

02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:20.000
Usagi Yojimbo.

02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:22.000
I don't even know this one.

02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:27.000
That's like from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles right?

02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:29.000
Yes, they actually had a game for it.

02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:35.000
Cool. I liked that character. I liked that he actually did a separate comic for him.

02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:41.000
Let's see, there actually is a video here on the YouTubes.

02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:44.000
Oh, this is the rabbit samurai thing.

02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:46.000
Yeah, Usagi Yojimbo.

02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:52.000
Oh, got it.

02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:55.000
I love this song.

02:25:55.000 --> 02:25:58.000
There you go. Alright, very cool.

02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:02.000
People are still using Commodore 64s to make music, it's awesome.

02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:14.000
I know, and it's like when you think about the way, the fact that it has about, it's supposedly about the same hardware I'm going to say as Nintendo, but they did a lot more than music, it just blows my mind apart.

02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:15.000
Absolutely.

02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:21.000
Alright, well, DDR Dollar Bill, we're going to let you go to try to take at least one more call here, but have a good one, okay buddy?

02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:22.000
You too, thanks a lot guys.

02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:27.000
Alright, thanks for the reminiscing of the Commodore 64 classics, and don't get into any more fistfights over a game.

02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:29.000
I'll try not to.

02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:31.000
Alright, later.

02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:37.000
Wow, you know, I believe that the kids fought over video games a long time ago, but I don't remember.

02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:42.000
You know, I played a lot of Street Fighter in the arcade, but I don't remember ever getting into a fistfight over it.

02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:44.000
I remember a lot of trash talking.

02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:48.000
Alright, any other last minute stories that we got going on tonight?

02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:49.000
No.

02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:52.000
Oh shit. Uh oh.

02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:53.000
Huh?

02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:54.000
I'm out of things to talk about.

02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:56.000
Call us people, dammit!

02:26:56.000 --> 02:27:03.000
Well, it's a minute and a half delay, so I posted it in chat, but it's going to take time before somebody gets through here.

02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:08.000
We're going to need to have like a list of things to talk about when the phones are dead, or something.

02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:12.000
Well, I've been doing a little bit of research, Rob, while we've been waiting for calls.

02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:15.000
And if, did we get a call yesterday?

02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:18.000
Yes, we got a call, so thank god. We'll come back to your thought, though, after this.

02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:20.000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:21.000
Ziba!

02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:23.000
Ziba! How are you, my friend?

02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:27.000
I'm doing good. I heard you guys talk about Commodore 64 a lot. I just wanted to give an update.

02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:30.000
Of course we were, because it's awesome.

02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:38.000
Remember when I called, I think it was before Christmas, or after Christmas or something, and I said I bought my boyfriend a Commodore 64?

02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:44.000
Yes, yes I do, because I remember telling you you were like the best girlfriend ever for doing that. Yes, I do.

02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:54.000
And then you guys told me I should look for something that will allow me to kind of use a flash card almost to play some games and do some stuff, but I actually did find something.

02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:56.000
Oh, what did you find?

02:27:56.000 --> 02:28:12.000
It's called UIEC. It's actually a, I guess this little SD card holder, and you actually hook it up to where the floppy drive hooks up to in the back of the Commodore.

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:18.000
And then you're actually able to put an SD card in it and save, just like a floppy drive.

02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:20.000
Oh my god, that sounds awesome!

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:32.000
And it actually comes with its own firmware and all this stuff, and you can go online and get the hacked ROMs or whatever, the games, and you actually can put it on there and play them.

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:47.000
But it's really hard because it's really hard to find ones that actually work, because like you said, the Commodore 64 was really big in the UK and all those places in Europe, because it still is.

02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:50.000
It still is? You know, I believe it.

02:28:50.000 --> 02:29:04.000
There's actually conventions in Europe that actually, there's a lot of demo scenes now that people are still coding on this thing and making their own little demo scenes.

02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:16.000
And some people do some really awesome stuff, and I've been trying to download some and play them, because you can do that too, but you can't play PAL demo scenes on a US Commodore.

02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:32.000
So I'm actually thinking about getting a PAL Commodore 64 just so I can play games in the right speed, because you can still play PAL games, but they play really fast because of the Hertz difference and stuff, whatever.

02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:44.000
But we're really enjoying it. My boyfriend has been coding and experimenting, and I just bought a joystick and I've been trying to play some games.

02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:46.000
But we're still loving it, even today.

02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:49.000
So what's one of the games on the Commodore 64 that you enjoy right now?

02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:51.000
Cybernoid 2.

02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:58.000
I remember Cybernoid. They made an NES port of the original one, and it's not as good as the Commodore 64 one, to be honest.

02:29:58.000 --> 02:30:10.000
I really like the music and just, you know, shooting little, like, I don't even know what the monsters are called, because they're just like these little, I don't know, blobs.

02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:12.000
But it's really fun. I really like it.

02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:16.000
Let's see, I got a little bit of the gameplay here of Cybernoid 2.

02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:19.000
This game was hard, too.

02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:27.000
But there's lots of cheats that it came with, so you can still play with it, but it's really fun.

02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:33.000
You know why the Commodore 64 was so awesome is because it was a little bit ahead of its time in the fact that you could hook it up to a TV.

02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:41.000
And so a lot of you didn't have to buy a separate monitor for it, and I think that was part of what really drove it, is that it was kind of like a gaming console computer.

02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:48.000
I mean, oh god, whenever I think of the 80s, I think of my Commodore 64, and just like, having that made me the nerd I am.

02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:50.000
It really did.

02:30:50.000 --> 02:30:54.000
We actually did have a hard time hooking up to TVs in here.

02:30:54.000 --> 02:31:00.000
First, I was trying to use a Nintendo RF adapter, which didn't work very well.

02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:05.000
So then I went online and I bought some cables, and it worked, but it was all black and white.

02:31:05.000 --> 02:31:08.000
So I was going crazy trying to find something.

02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:18.000
Finally, I went to Radio Shack and I got this adapter, and this little small adapter that allowed me to put a cable wire in it, and then hook it up to the TV that way.

02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:27.000
But even, I was reading online, people were having lots of trouble putting it on a LCD TV because of the difference.

02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:28.000
Oh sure.

02:31:28.000 --> 02:31:30.000
I guess, yeah, since the TVs are new.

02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:31.000
Oh sure, I bet.

02:31:31.000 --> 02:31:44.000
You know, and the old, from what I remember, I actually had a Commodore 64 monitor, and what I remember of those cables, they were a little different because there were two video cable inputs and one audio.

02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:48.000
And most RCA, the red, yellow, white, are two audio and one video.

02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:53.000
And I think that's why a lot of people get black and white when they try to hook it up, is because of that.

02:31:53.000 --> 02:32:01.000
So, yeah, but I guess, I'm sure with this still being popular to develop today, people are figuring it out, you know?

02:32:01.000 --> 02:32:04.000
So, alright.

02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:06.000
Alright, well thank you so much for the call, Ziba.

02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:07.000
No problem.

02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:10.000
Is there anything else you want to get out there before we let you go so we can get more calls?

02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:11.000
No, that's it.

02:32:11.000 --> 02:32:13.000
Alright, take care my friend.

02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:14.000
Alright, bye bye.

02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:15.000
Bye.

02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:21.000
Alright, I guess we'll let there be one more call here before we wrap things up.

02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:23.000
I'm excited to chat again to see if that will work.

02:32:23.000 --> 02:32:28.000
Meanwhile, while we wait for that to come in, DarkSakura, what were we talking about a minute ago?

02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:29.000
You were gonna...

02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:30.000
I'm actually...

02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:31.000
Oh, your project.

02:32:31.000 --> 02:32:34.000
Yeah, I'm actually looking into logic board replacement.

02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:35.000
Really?

02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:43.000
Yeah, because you can't replace the processor because it's soldered into the logic board.

02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:46.000
But you can replace the logic board with the processor on it.

02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:56.000
So, I'm actually now... my goal is to still get the, you know, OSX working and everything.

02:32:56.000 --> 02:33:00.000
But this is actually turning out to be a little bit more fun than I thought it was gonna be.

02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:06.000
Because I can actually get a new logic board for about 100 bucks.

02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:08.000
Alright, let's go to the phones. We have another call coming in.

02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:10.000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:11.000
Hey guys.

02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:12.000
Hey.

02:33:12.000 --> 02:33:13.000
I just know who it is.

02:33:13.000 --> 02:33:14.000
This is DDR Angel, isn't it?

02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:15.000
Hi.

02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:18.000
Holy moly, I haven't heard from you in forever.

02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:21.000
Well, I mean, I've seen you on Twitter and all that, some Facebook and all that.

02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:25.000
But I mean, having you on OLR, this is like old school.

02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:31.000
I remember, wasn't the first episode you ever came to of OLR episode 20?

02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:32.000
I think it was.

02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:33.000
Something like that.

02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:34.000
Or like 22.

02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:38.000
It was really... it was when OLR expanded from a two-hour show to a three-hour show officially.

02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:39.000
I remember that.

02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:41.000
Actually, it was when you were in that big house. I don't remember.

02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:42.000
That was like 2003 or something.

02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:43.000
It was a long time ago.

02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:45.000
I think we've had like seven different studios since then.

02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:48.000
Yeah, that was when I lived with a guy named Brian.

02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:49.000
That was many years ago.

02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:50.000
Yes.

02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:51.000
Ten years ago.

02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:52.000
Yep.

02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:53.000
Crazy stuff.

02:33:53.000 --> 02:33:55.000
I just called because the Skype line was open.

02:33:55.000 --> 02:33:57.000
I didn't really have anything I wanted to say.

02:33:57.000 --> 02:33:58.000
Well, you're lucky.

02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:07.000
It's funny because now that people realize it's open, we're getting hammered with like five people all at once.

02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:09.000
And I feel bad because some people can't get through.

02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:10.000
But we'll see.

02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:14.000
Well, DDR Angel, I know you didn't have a whole lot. You just want to kind of say hi.

02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:19.000
But for those that are new to OLR, believe it or not, we're still here, as you can hear.

02:34:19.000 --> 02:34:23.000
And we have a lot of people that we've picked up since the podcasting era.

02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:29.000
When we switched to podcasting, we gained a whole lot of new listeners because you didn't have to be here live Sunday every week to listen.

02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:31.000
But I know you've been listening to tonight's show.

02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:35.000
What's kind of different about OLR than the way it used to be?

02:34:35.000 --> 02:34:41.000
Well, to me, there's a lot of old stuff that's still there.

02:34:41.000 --> 02:34:43.000
So, you know, the main part of the show is still there.

02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:46.000
And I didn't see too much of a difference.

02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:50.000
But, I mean, you guys do have, you know, a lot of other segments and stuff that you add in.

02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:54.000
So it's just old LRR still being there.

02:34:54.000 --> 02:34:57.000
But, you know, you just have your new segments too, which I like.

02:34:57.000 --> 02:35:00.000
So it's all good. I mean, I don't know.

02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:01.000
Awesome.

02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:06.000
Well, anything else about the olden OLR days you want to enlighten these new kids with?

02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:10.000
Cake pie. No, wait. You guys already did that.

02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:12.000
Old school jokes.

02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:14.000
We were joking about all that old stuff earlier.

02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:15.000
Yeah.

02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:20.000
So now, for those that are kind of catching up on lost time, you know, you used to come to the show as a guest quite often.

02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:21.000
Yes.

02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:27.000
Now, I remember you used to play a game called Here? Was that what it was called?

02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:28.000
Oh, There.

02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:29.000
There.

02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:30.000
Yeah.

02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:31.000
Very close.

02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:32.000
Close. Very close.

02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:33.000
Are you still involved?

02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:34.000
They had to shut down.

02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:36.000
Yeah, they had to shut down. Right. I remember that.

02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:39.000
So sadly you're not. But you were with them right up until the very end, right?

02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:40.000
Yes.

02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:41.000
Awesome.

02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:42.000
Gotcha. Gotcha.

02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:46.000
And I believe you got married since the last time you were here?

02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:49.000
Yeah, I did actually.

02:35:49.000 --> 02:36:00.000
Somebody from the Balmany community a long time ago that used to come into the chat room by the name of Ohio BRP Balmany or whatever.

02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:01.000
Uh-huh.

02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:02.000
Yeah.

02:36:02.000 --> 02:36:04.000
I don't remember his name actually.

02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:05.000
Big Red Pimp?

02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:06.000
Yes, Big Red Pimp.

02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:08.000
It was a long time ago. There you go.

02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:10.000
So you guys actually ended up getting married?

02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:11.000
Yep.

02:36:11.000 --> 02:36:12.000
Congratulations.

02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:13.000
Thank you.

02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:15.000
Are you still here in California? You moved out to Ohio, didn't you?

02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:17.000
No, I didn't. No, no. I'm still in California.

02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:18.000
No, he moved here.

02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:20.000
I'm in Sonoma County actually.

02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:21.000
Oh, you're still there?

02:36:21.000 --> 02:36:25.000
Yeah, I'm still here. You can come by anytime, guys.

02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:30.000
I might have to. That's awesome. I thought for some reason you went to Ohio for a bit.

02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:33.000
Oh, no, no, no, no. He's just from here. He moved here.

02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:36.000
Oh, okay. Got it. See, I'm a little bit behind on the times too.

02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:37.000
No, it's all good.

02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:39.000
All right, but you have a blog. I know you have a blog.

02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:40.000
I do.

02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:41.000
Do you want to pimp it real quick?

02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:42.000
It has nothing to do with gaming.

02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:46.000
That's all right. Why don't you go ahead and pimp your blog and I'll try to get one more call.

02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:50.000
Sure. You guys can check it out at theecomaker.com.

02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:57.000
I can type it in the chat room so that you guys can put it on the site or the notes or whatever you want to do.

02:36:57.000 --> 02:37:00.000
And what will people find at theecomaker.com?

02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:09.000
Pretty much anything to do with making your own cleaning products to making dinner for dinner ideas and such too.

02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:11.000
It's a very homely site.

02:37:11.000 --> 02:37:13.000
Yes, yes, it is.

02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:14.000
All right. Welcome back.

02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:16.000
But it also saves you money as well, so it kind of works out.

02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:20.000
Welcome back and I'm really glad you decided to stop by tonight. It's always nice to see Blast From the Past.

02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:25.000
Yeah, no problem. And hopefully I can check out our show at some point. I don't know. We'll have to talk about that.

02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:30.000
Awesome. All right, well you take care and all the best to the hubby as well and you guys take care.

02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:31.000
Definitely. You guys take care too.

02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:33.000
All right. Bye.

02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:34.000
Bye.

02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:36.000
That was nice to hear from Blast From the Past.

02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:37.000
Yep.

02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:39.000
We've been doing this show a long fucking time, you know that?

02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:41.000
Yeah, a long time.

02:37:41.000 --> 02:37:43.000
But hey, we're going to make it to ten.

02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:48.000
You know what? What the hell? One more call. Why not? We had a short news segment tonight.

02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:51.000
We'll open up one more time. Just because our phones were getting slammed there a minute ago.

02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:57.000
So we'll open it up one more time for you guys. 1877 Game OLR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:37:57.000 --> 02:37:59.000
The phone lines are open.

02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:06.000
But of course this means while I wait for the little delay there, I have to think of another banter topic with Dark Sakura.

02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:10.000
I'm nearly... I'm excited, Rob.

02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:12.000
How so? With your project?

02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:15.000
Yeah. Thank you for making this possible.

02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:17.000
You're welcome.

02:38:17.000 --> 02:38:19.000
Well, I was just collecting dust at your place anyway.

02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:21.000
Yeah, it's true. No, the old laptop.

02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:24.000
You know, it's amazing the stuff I'm finding while I'm going through and unpacking this.

02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:26.000
I found an old picture of you.

02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:27.000
Of me.

02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:33.000
And Melody taping an episode of Under Sedation Live in Travis's old backyard.

02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:37.000
Oh.

02:38:37.000 --> 02:38:39.000
An old, old picture.

02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:43.000
Melody all huddled together looking cute during... I remember this too. Travis did.

02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:44.000
Yeah.

02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:47.000
He did like a backyard episode of Under Sedation Live. I don't remember what the shtick was.

02:38:47.000 --> 02:38:48.000
You'll have to bring it over.

02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:52.000
There's always some shtick with Travis. I love him, but there's always some shtick.

02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:54.000
And this is the backyard episode shtick.

02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:55.000
Yeah.

02:38:55.000 --> 02:38:58.000
Oh yeah, I found that. I found one of all of us on a DDR machine.

02:38:58.000 --> 02:39:04.000
It was me, you, Irene. The guy Irene was dating at the time.

02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:06.000
So she probably don't want to see that picture.

02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:09.000
You and I... Who else was in it? I think one other person was all in the picture.

02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:12.000
Maybe Brad?

02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:13.000
Oh, Bradley? No.

02:39:13.000 --> 02:39:15.000
Not Bradley. Brad.

02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:18.000
Yeah, I think he's in it. Hence the crazy person that Irene was dating at the time.

02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:19.000
Yeah.

02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:23.000
I don't know. I don't know. I don't remember what else. Somebody else I think was in that picture.

02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:27.000
He was our Mighty Mormon Power Ranger.

02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:30.000
Let's see. What else did I find when I was moving?

02:39:30.000 --> 02:39:33.000
Let me know if you find the install disks.

02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:34.000
For what? The laptop?

02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:35.000
Yeah.

02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:38.000
I doubt I'll find that.

02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:39.000
You know I'm being silly.

02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:41.000
I know.

02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:43.000
I want to see the old pictures.

02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:45.000
I will find those pictures and I will get them to you.

02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:48.000
All right, finally the calls are coming in. The delay caught up.

02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:50.000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:56.000
I made it in. Wow, you guys are like trying to call Britney Spears on a Friday night or something.

02:39:56.000 --> 02:39:58.000
It's great. It feels special.

02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:03.000
This is Derek H. Derek from Virginia Beach, Virginia.

02:40:03.000 --> 02:40:07.000
Derek, how are you? Of course I recognize your voice the minute I picked up. How are you, my friend?

02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:10.000
Eh, you know, it's this and that.

02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:17.000
The important thing is the Commodore 64, I had one. I loved it.

02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:20.000
I started with a VIC-20, went all the way up to an Amiga 1200.

02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:26.000
0306060 for those in the know. I'm sorry, 0304040.

02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:30.000
You stuck with Commodore for a very long time because the Amigas were like the last big hurrahs for them.

02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:37.000
Yeah, that was sad because if you had an Amiga, you were the type of person that believed.

02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:46.000
And I mean like you believed that one day everybody else would wake up and everybody would be using Amigas.

02:40:46.000 --> 02:40:52.000
And you will be vindicated for all your years of, yeah, that never happened.

02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:57.000
Amigas were kind of the max of their time, which is ironic because max were out at the same time.

02:40:57.000 --> 02:41:01.000
But you know how people pay the premiums for the Apple products these days?

02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:04.000
Amiga was kind of like that back in the day, in a way.

02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:10.000
You know what has happened to Mac? That's what Amiga people thought were going to happen for Amiga.

02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:13.000
It had it all.

02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:19.000
If only they had cellular phones when Commodore was big. Maybe they could have been the ones to think of it first.

02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:23.000
That Amiga was so great. But the Commodore 64, I guess, is what we're talking about.

02:41:23.000 --> 02:41:30.000
The Amiga was kick-ass. You said you were thinking about going to get one. Yeah, don't do that.

02:41:30.000 --> 02:41:33.000
Why? Are they all in terrible shape?

02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:41.000
Stick with the emulation because once you get one, it's like all of a sudden everything rushes back to you.

02:41:41.000 --> 02:41:50.000
Except it rushes back to you in present day because computers now are literally two to three thousand times faster than the Commodore 64.

02:41:50.000 --> 02:41:55.000
That's not even an exaggeration. Like, a thousand times faster than that thing.

02:41:55.000 --> 02:42:00.000
Yeah, the 64 was for what? 64K of memory that was in that thing?

02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:05.000
64K. I have more memory on one web page.

02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:07.000
Exactly. Yep.

02:42:07.000 --> 02:42:09.000
Good Lord.

02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:21.000
Games, you think they're going to play right, but they don't because back then you expected the lag.

02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:26.000
When you move the joystick, you expected a half second or second thing before something moved on the screen.

02:42:26.000 --> 02:42:31.000
Nowadays, if that happens, you're like, what the hell is wrong with this thing? What's wrong?

02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:38.000
And then you'll fall out of love with the Commodore. Remember the Commodore 64 as it is. As it was, not as it is.

02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:43.000
This happens a lot in gaming. You know, things are better through those retro colored glasses.

02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:49.000
Or, you know, they say the rose colored glasses, but the retro colored glasses, sometimes I think we remember gaming better that way.

02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:53.000
And I just mentioned this earlier in the show, the X-Men arcade game that's on Xbox Live.

02:42:53.000 --> 02:43:00.000
I love the X-Men arcade game, but then when I downloaded it on Xbox Live, I was like, what is this crap that I used to love? You know?

02:43:00.000 --> 02:43:03.000
What the hell is going on here?

02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:08.000
And my favorite game of all time, you guys are talking about favorite games too.

02:43:08.000 --> 02:43:16.000
My favorite game of all time is not just my favorite game of all time, it is the greatest game of all time. Period. End of story.

02:43:16.000 --> 02:43:18.000
And that is Elite.

02:43:18.000 --> 02:43:19.000
Elite?

02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:33.000
Elite is insanely good. And for what they stuck on that 64K and that floppy disk, which I think held like 150K or something, some stupid low number.

02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:44.000
It had more worlds on Elite than Mass Effect 1, Mass Effect 2, all of the Wing Commanders combined.

02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:51.000
You got Jamie's husband, Dan, up from the couch to come in here to say and agree with you that Elite was awesome, just so you know.

02:43:51.000 --> 02:43:58.000
All the stuff that people say you can do is like, oh, it's an open world. If you want to do this, if you want to be a rogue, be a rogue.

02:43:58.000 --> 02:44:09.000
Elite had that, except it was 25 years ago on a Commodore 64. You can literally say, I'm just gonna spend the rest of my life just moving corn back and forth between these two planets.

02:44:09.000 --> 02:44:14.000
Or I'm just gonna be a policeman and hang out and just kill bad guys while they're trying to run.

02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:24.000
Or you can beat anything in that game thousands of years before Grand Theft Auto 4 came around.

02:44:24.000 --> 02:44:30.000
Or Star Wars Galaxies Old School of the Jedis thing.

02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:37.000
You know, I think the Mass Effect comparison is a pretty good one with Elite. It was like a space game, right?

02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:44.000
Yeah, you could pick your own ship, you could outfit your ship, they had tribbles in it.

02:44:44.000 --> 02:44:50.000
I don't want to play the game, but I can't play it because it's on the freaking Commodore 64 and it's gonna suck if I play it now.

02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:54.000
You have to remember it how it was, Derek. You have to remember it how it was.

02:44:54.000 --> 02:45:00.000
The original SimCity was on the Commodore 64, and of course that game's blown up a million times over.

02:45:00.000 --> 02:45:05.000
What was another great Commodore 64 game? I remember Spy vs. Spy was one of my favorites.

02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:07.000
Little Computer People is The Sims.

02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:13.000
Oh yes, Little Computer People. Oh god, Mule, M-U-L-E, was a huge game.

02:45:13.000 --> 02:45:17.000
That's just a lot of economics in games kind of gets its cue from Mule.

02:45:17.000 --> 02:45:19.000
Good times, Derek, good times.

02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:23.000
Hey, I have to ask you this because, you know, if we both kind of grew up on Commodore,

02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:26.000
did you ever used to type in the programs that were in the back of magazines?

02:45:26.000 --> 02:45:33.000
Of course. Video games and computer entertainment had a little thing I would sit there and type it in.

02:45:33.000 --> 02:45:43.000
And here's the sad part. I did not get a break of 1541 for like a year because we were poor.

02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:50.000
And I still thank my mom because now I don't know how she got me that Commodore 64 because we were poor and she got me one.

02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:53.000
So I thank her every day for getting me started on this.

02:45:53.000 --> 02:45:56.000
But it took her a while before I got to 1541.

02:45:56.000 --> 02:46:02.000
So I would sit there and type those programs in and tell everybody not to come near my computer

02:46:02.000 --> 02:46:09.000
and I'll put a pillow over top of it and hide it so nobody would turn it off because once you turn it off, it's gone.

02:46:09.000 --> 02:46:12.000
There's no flash ram saving stuff.

02:46:12.000 --> 02:46:15.000
You didn't have a drive to save on?

02:46:15.000 --> 02:46:20.000
Save. And plus when I first got it, I typed load and load didn't work.

02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:22.000
You had to type load comma eight comma one.

02:46:22.000 --> 02:46:23.000
Yeah.

02:46:23.000 --> 02:46:26.000
It took me a while to figure it out. I was like, this thing is broke, mom.

02:46:26.000 --> 02:46:28.000
It don't work.

02:46:28.000 --> 02:46:33.000
And I knew she wasn't, but I knew if she took it back, she wasn't replacing it.

02:46:33.000 --> 02:46:35.000
She was taking it back and getting her money and I would never see that again.

02:46:35.000 --> 02:46:39.000
So I would just, I would cry without getting it working.

02:46:39.000 --> 02:46:43.000
But you know what? You stuck with it and maybe it taught you a lesson.

02:46:43.000 --> 02:46:44.000
Yeah.

02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:50.000
It taught me not to believe in miracles.

02:46:50.000 --> 02:46:52.000
Speaking of believing in miracles, I have to ask this.

02:46:52.000 --> 02:46:57.000
Obviously, a lot of people on the All Games Network know you from your show, Dead Pixel Live.

02:46:57.000 --> 02:47:00.000
I know you're on a little bit of a siesta right now,

02:47:00.000 --> 02:47:05.000
enjoying your Mai Tais on the beach while you're taking a break from Dead Pixel Live.

02:47:05.000 --> 02:47:11.000
But any chance of a revival in the future?

02:47:11.000 --> 02:47:15.000
All I can say now is Dead Pixel Live is currently on hiatus.

02:47:15.000 --> 02:47:20.000
I have found out, as you guys may or may not know, I'm sure you do know,

02:47:20.000 --> 02:47:23.000
this thing kind of fills a hole in your life.

02:47:23.000 --> 02:47:24.000
Yeah.

02:47:24.000 --> 02:47:29.000
And without it, all of a sudden you realize, like, I miss a lot of,

02:47:29.000 --> 02:47:33.000
I kind of want to do my show again, but I guess that maybe I should get out more.

02:47:33.000 --> 02:47:35.000
But I really want to do my show.

02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:39.000
It's like, it's good that it was there, but the fact, I don't know,

02:47:39.000 --> 02:47:42.000
it's all psychological stuff done working.

02:47:42.000 --> 02:47:46.000
I really don't know what I'd do with my Sunday nights without OLR.

02:47:46.000 --> 02:47:48.000
I'd probably be watching Desperate Housewives and that's just sad.

02:47:48.000 --> 02:47:52.000
I know what I would do. I would play more Dragon Age 2.

02:47:52.000 --> 02:47:54.000
Not now, but all right.

02:47:54.000 --> 02:47:57.000
Then you'd be like, I want to tell somebody about Dragon Age 2.

02:47:57.000 --> 02:48:00.000
I remember when I had a show and it was a lot of fun.

02:48:00.000 --> 02:48:03.000
Actually, I'd probably just do another show.

02:48:03.000 --> 02:48:08.000
Oh, listen to how she is. I would just do a show without you guys.

02:48:08.000 --> 02:48:12.000
No, I couldn't do it without you guys.

02:48:12.000 --> 02:48:14.000
Maybe with Tiara.

02:48:14.000 --> 02:48:17.000
All right. Well, Derek, best of luck in whatever it is you do.

02:48:17.000 --> 02:48:20.000
And thanks so much for the call and taking a trip down memory lane with us.

02:48:20.000 --> 02:48:22.000
Hey, thanks. Hey, Amiga forever.

02:48:22.000 --> 02:48:25.000
That's right. Take care, buddy.

02:48:25.000 --> 02:48:27.000
All right. That's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

02:48:27.000 --> 02:48:31.000
Those are some good calls. See, it was worth waiting for.

02:48:31.000 --> 02:48:33.000
Even though, and some folks still didn't get through.

02:48:33.000 --> 02:48:35.000
I'm so sorry. We had more people beeping us.

02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:37.000
The phones were lighting up. Send us an email.

02:48:37.000 --> 02:48:40.000
We had two emails and a lit up phone line.

02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:41.000
What's wrong with this picture?

02:48:41.000 --> 02:48:43.000
Not one, but two.

02:48:43.000 --> 02:48:46.000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com. Send us your thoughts in email.

02:48:46.000 --> 02:48:48.000
That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio,

02:48:48.000 --> 02:48:51.000
but not until we go around and get everybody's final thought.

02:48:51.000 --> 02:48:55.000
Loki, we'll start with you tonight. Your final thought?

02:48:55.000 --> 02:48:59.000
Designing a free-running course is hard.

02:48:59.000 --> 02:49:03.000
My final thought is I still have kitchenware to pack. Joy.

02:49:03.000 --> 02:49:05.000
Dark Sakura, your final thought?

02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:09.000
I wonder what my hair was like in that picture.

02:49:09.000 --> 02:49:10.000
Was it long?

02:49:10.000 --> 02:49:11.000
I think so.

02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:14.000
It was when I had long, really kind of crabby, bushy hair that was five to six shades of red.

02:49:14.000 --> 02:49:15.000
Yes.

02:49:15.000 --> 02:49:16.000
Yeah.

02:49:16.000 --> 02:49:17.000
Good times.

02:49:17.000 --> 02:49:19.000
But I have much better hair these days.

02:49:19.000 --> 02:49:23.000
If you guys like what you hear here at Orange Lounge Radio, tell some friends about the show.

02:49:23.000 --> 02:49:25.000
Word of mouth is all we got to promote the show.

02:49:25.000 --> 02:49:27.000
Leave us a nice reveal on iTunes. That always works as well.

02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:30.000
Or wherever it is that you choose to check out your podcast.

02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:32.000
We really appreciate you guys sticking with us every week.

02:49:32.000 --> 02:49:35.000
We'll be back to do it all again next week. Sound good?

02:49:35.000 --> 02:49:36.000
Yeah.

02:49:36.000 --> 02:49:40.000
And we will see you next time here at Orange Lounge Radio for episode 410 in two weeks.

02:49:40.000 --> 02:49:42.000
I'm sorry, not next week. We are off next week.

02:49:42.000 --> 02:49:44.000
So, we'll be back in two weeks.

02:49:44.000 --> 02:49:48.000
But remember, Jamie wants Portal 2 for PS3.

02:49:48.000 --> 02:49:51.000
And when we come back in two weeks, Portal will be out.

02:49:51.000 --> 02:49:53.000
Mortal Kombat will be out. We'll have tons of stuff to talk about.

02:49:53.000 --> 02:49:55.000
And I'll thank whoever got me Portal 2.

02:49:55.000 --> 02:49:57.000
It's going to be a busy show in a couple weeks.

02:49:57.000 --> 02:49:59.000
So, enjoy the week off, everybody.

02:49:59.000 --> 02:50:02.000
We'll be back in two weeks with another edition of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:50:02.000 --> 02:50:03.000
