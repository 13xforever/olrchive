00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:11,291
[SPEAKER_07]: I am Loki!

2
00:00:31,638 --> 00:00:36,702
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:36,802 --> 00:00:39,203
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the show where every gamer has a voice.

4
00:00:39,624 --> 00:00:48,530
[SPEAKER_06]: We tape live at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf Show.

5
00:00:48,991 --> 00:00:49,791
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Rob Roberts.

6
00:00:49,831 --> 00:00:52,233
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-hosts.

7
00:00:52,313 --> 00:00:55,095
[SPEAKER_06]: First up, the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

8
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:55,555
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.

9
00:00:55,795 --> 00:00:56,276
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you?

10
00:00:56,296 --> 00:00:56,376
[SPEAKER_06]: Good.

11
00:00:56,696 --> 00:00:58,477
[SPEAKER_02]: Feeling far better than I did previously.

12
00:00:58,657 --> 00:00:58,857
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

13
00:00:59,918 --> 00:01:00,618
[SPEAKER_02]: I can eat now.

14
00:01:01,058 --> 00:01:02,899
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'm sorry to hear you were sick and all.

15
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:03,620
[SPEAKER_06]: What happened?

16
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,740
[SPEAKER_06]: You just had a... No idea.

17
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:05,621
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was just a bug.

18
00:01:05,641 --> 00:01:06,721
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's too bad.

19
00:01:06,981 --> 00:01:11,223
[SPEAKER_02]: It had to have been a virus because nobody else got sick, so... Do you feel refreshed after a week off?

20
00:01:11,243 --> 00:01:12,144
[SPEAKER_06]: We weren't here last week.

21
00:01:12,904 --> 00:01:21,949
[SPEAKER_06]: Um... And you were really the only one that didn't, like, have anything going... Well, I mean, I don't know if you ended up doing something else, but... I got to spend... It was Loki's and my fault, so... I got to spend a good night with my boy.

22
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:22,909
[SPEAKER_06]: Good, good.

23
00:01:22,929 --> 00:01:23,910
[SPEAKER_06]: A little date night?

24
00:01:25,163 --> 00:01:26,125
[SPEAKER_02]: More of a hanging out.

25
00:01:26,225 --> 00:01:26,886
[SPEAKER_06]: How cute.

26
00:01:27,046 --> 00:01:27,708
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just kidding.

27
00:01:27,748 --> 00:01:30,693
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, I think we actually played some more Final Fantasy that night.

28
00:01:30,833 --> 00:01:33,378
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, your little Final Fantasy megathon or whatever you're doing?

29
00:01:33,398 --> 00:01:34,480
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, whenever we get back to it.

30
00:01:34,721 --> 00:01:35,562
[SPEAKER_02]: We got the level up.

31
00:01:36,224 --> 00:01:36,805
[SPEAKER_02]: The job change.

32
00:01:37,318 --> 00:01:38,159
[SPEAKER_06]: TechMasterLoki.com

33
00:02:00,856 --> 00:02:04,481
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't wait until next year when they're all like, we've done all this, who cares?

34
00:02:05,763 --> 00:02:10,549
[SPEAKER_06]: So sadly, Loki is not here tonight, but filling in for Techmaster Loki, say hello to Salacious Pop.

35
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:10,989
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello.

36
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:11,530
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you?

37
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:12,191
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm great.

38
00:02:12,331 --> 00:02:14,794
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for coming here on kind of a short notice.

39
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:16,416
[SPEAKER_06]: So, appreciate it.

40
00:02:16,817 --> 00:02:17,237
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

41
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,701
[SPEAKER_06]: But I always thought Easter was kind of done in the morning.

42
00:02:43,861 --> 00:02:46,223
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I finished Easter stuff in the morning today.

43
00:02:46,323 --> 00:02:48,665
[SPEAKER_06]: I had family stuff going on, but that was all in the morning.

44
00:02:48,765 --> 00:02:49,345
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I don't know.

45
00:02:49,985 --> 00:02:53,408
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I mean, I think the real Easter experience is you get up and you go to church.

46
00:02:54,308 --> 00:02:57,871
[SPEAKER_09]: So, if you're not going to Mass, then you can make it up as you go along.

47
00:02:57,891 --> 00:02:59,752
[SPEAKER_06]: Mass is like at midnight or something, right?

48
00:02:59,832 --> 00:03:02,194
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you got plenty of time for OLR still, right?

49
00:03:02,234 --> 00:03:02,734
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I don't know.

50
00:03:02,834 --> 00:03:03,494
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, forget it.

51
00:03:04,695 --> 00:03:07,037
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll quit being a heathen or whatever.

52
00:03:07,657 --> 00:03:09,559
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, let's introduce the chat room.

53
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:10,179
[SPEAKER_06]: They're always there.

54
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:12,680
[SPEAKER_02]: because really, Jesus died so you could have chocolate.

55
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,960
[SPEAKER_06]: Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

56
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,201
[SPEAKER_06]: Marshmallow Peeps.

57
00:03:16,241 --> 00:03:16,441
[SPEAKER_06]: Ew!

58
00:03:18,101 --> 00:03:20,542
[SPEAKER_06]: Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

59
00:03:20,722 --> 00:03:27,824
[SPEAKER_06]: You can chat live with us here on tonight's program and get your little piece in, whatever it is you want to say and so forth.

60
00:03:29,024 --> 00:03:31,105
[SPEAKER_06]: A handful of people in chat despite the holiday.

61
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:40,128
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, it's a little less than usual and in part you can blame a week off because I'll tell you what, Horde House inadvertently had a week off as well and I'll tell you what, died.

62
00:03:40,348 --> 00:03:41,228
[SPEAKER_06]: Forums died.

63
00:03:41,548 --> 00:03:48,590
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like if you do a podcast, I'll tell you what, here's the advice because we get emails once in a while saying, you know, how have you guys stuck with doing a podcast for nine years?

64
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:49,590
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have any advice?

65
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:54,112
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, my advice, try never to take weeks off unless you absolutely have to because...

66
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:56,134
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

67
00:04:14,019 --> 00:04:15,580
[SPEAKER_02]: I played a bunch of stuff.

68
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:16,980
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I played a lot of World of Warcraft.

69
00:04:18,061 --> 00:04:20,301
[SPEAKER_02]: And two new games appeared on my Steam account today.

70
00:04:21,382 --> 00:04:30,085
[SPEAKER_02]: The Star Trek DAC and Darwinia, which I have installed, just have not played because I had an epic nap today.

71
00:04:30,385 --> 00:04:30,885
[SPEAKER_02]: I still got it.

72
00:04:50,578 --> 00:04:51,159
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

73
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:37,957
[SPEAKER_02]: and some of that really awesome Terminator gun game and this weird trivia game that I really didn't know much of the answers to because it was like sports and pop culture like the type of pop culture that I don't keep up with and uh what else did I play because I played other stuff I played Droplets when I had my big bad insomnia attack last night except all it really did was make me have to pee and uh

74
00:05:39,873 --> 00:06:07,315
[SPEAKER_02]: some uh Luminous and uh what else did I play I played something else oh yeah um Peggle Extreme and then watched an entire playthrough of Portal 2 you actually watched the whole thing start to finish huh yes I did wow see I didn't want to ruin it for myself I did that with the last one too did you really that means now I'll have some idea so how to play a little bit more seamlessly so that I do not get too motion sick

75
00:06:08,234 --> 00:06:14,938
[SPEAKER_06]: So do you find that if you kind of play the YouTubes in advance or whatever that it helps the experience or hurts it?

76
00:06:15,018 --> 00:06:16,038
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it helps it.

77
00:06:16,719 --> 00:06:18,560
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been trying very hard to dodge spoilers.

78
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,981
[SPEAKER_06]: I have not beaten Portal 2 yet.

79
00:06:20,621 --> 00:06:23,142
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm really like everybody's like, you got to hear the song.

80
00:06:23,162 --> 00:06:24,603
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, doesn't the song have spoilers?

81
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:26,764
[SPEAKER_06]: So not really.

82
00:06:27,545 --> 00:06:29,986
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, yeah, it does really give away the ending.

83
00:06:30,266 --> 00:06:31,827
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm trying really hard to avoid all that.

84
00:06:31,887 --> 00:06:32,547
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know.

85
00:06:32,647 --> 00:06:32,868
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

86
00:06:34,128 --> 00:06:35,389
[SPEAKER_02]: But I love it.

87
00:06:37,582 --> 00:06:40,294
[SPEAKER_02]: My favorite thing so far is Bird Kill It!

88
00:06:42,327 --> 00:06:45,630
[SPEAKER_09]: So do you know that it's Noble Garden Week in WoW?

89
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:46,611
[SPEAKER_09]: She played some WoW.

90
00:06:46,631 --> 00:06:47,091
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Easter.

91
00:06:47,111 --> 00:06:48,152
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Easter holiday.

92
00:06:48,172 --> 00:06:49,033
[SPEAKER_09]: It's one of the easier ones.

93
00:06:49,453 --> 00:06:50,134
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't do that.

94
00:06:50,214 --> 00:06:50,734
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll have to do it.

95
00:06:50,814 --> 00:06:51,435
[SPEAKER_09]: It's all this week.

96
00:06:51,495 --> 00:06:52,236
[SPEAKER_09]: It just started today.

97
00:06:52,776 --> 00:06:53,076
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

98
00:06:53,617 --> 00:06:54,718
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Rob's favorite holiday.

99
00:06:55,979 --> 00:06:58,141
[SPEAKER_06]: No, my favorite holiday is coming up next week in WoW.

100
00:06:58,181 --> 00:06:59,222
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Children's Week.

101
00:06:59,722 --> 00:07:03,105
[SPEAKER_06]: And by favorite, I mean, oh, it's terrible.

102
00:07:03,565 --> 00:07:08,590
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's the one holiday I need for my Violet Drake because literally last year I said, fuck Children's Week.

103
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:09,811
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not putting up with this bullshit.

104
00:07:10,531 --> 00:07:11,051
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you gotta do it.

105
00:07:11,071 --> 00:07:12,272
[SPEAKER_06]: And I had to wait an entire year.

106
00:07:13,292 --> 00:07:13,572
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow.

107
00:07:14,872 --> 00:07:21,034
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's... I found, by the way, a dragon that I want that's blue and has transparent wings, looks kind of aquatic.

108
00:07:22,094 --> 00:07:23,414
[SPEAKER_06]: It might be one of those hard-to-get ones.

109
00:07:23,854 --> 00:07:24,594
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, but I want it.

110
00:07:25,255 --> 00:07:25,495
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

111
00:07:25,535 --> 00:07:26,015
[SPEAKER_06]: It will be mine.

112
00:07:26,415 --> 00:07:28,075
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's move on with some other video games.

113
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:30,736
[SPEAKER_06]: Salacious Pop, what did you play this week?

114
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:38,782
[SPEAKER_09]: I've actually played a lot, considering that usually my schedule is simply WoW, which I'm playing far less of.

115
00:07:39,343 --> 00:07:44,845
[SPEAKER_09]: I played some Toki Tori because it was a part of the Steam potato bag special.

116
00:07:44,885 --> 00:07:52,889
[SPEAKER_09]: I had already owned Toki Tori, so they just patched in the potato Portal 2 content because I wanted to try and unlock Portal 2 early.

117
00:07:54,229 --> 00:07:57,291
[SPEAKER_09]: Even though I didn't really have the means to buy it, I still haven't really played Portal 2 yet.

118
00:07:57,811 --> 00:08:16,475
[SPEAKER_09]: so Toki Tori, Mortal Kombat beat the story mode and did some just regular one person versus PC fighting on that and some Smash TV some Fatal... Going old school, what made you do Smash TV?

119
00:08:16,936 --> 00:08:27,058
[SPEAKER_09]: Just when we were I was putting my Xbox Live account on your Xbox and was trying to sync up all the games that you have on it so I was just going through some old stuff on there um

120
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:31,641
[SPEAKER_09]: and yeah, that's it really.

121
00:08:33,643 --> 00:08:35,024
[SPEAKER_06]: What did you think of Mortal Kombat?

122
00:08:35,784 --> 00:08:37,706
[SPEAKER_09]: I wish the story mode was longer because

123
00:08:39,925 --> 00:08:50,248
[SPEAKER_09]: All the endless fighting, if there's even just a little bit of dialogue in between, it'll hold my attention more than just doing ladder mode and getting up to the boss and starting all over from scratch.

124
00:08:51,068 --> 00:08:51,868
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, I liked it.

125
00:08:51,928 --> 00:09:03,932
[SPEAKER_09]: I found a lot of bugs in it, audio bugs, that hopefully they'll be able to patch and fix once a certain system is back online, which we'll get into, I'm sure, in a minute.

126
00:09:04,572 --> 00:09:30,360
[SPEAKER_09]: um but yeah it's fun it's it's a good uh I mean they pretty much looked at what Street Fighter 4 did and it's like oh that's awesome we should do that for our franchise franchise and it it's working for them so yes and it doesn't hurt that they've had a little bit of a break with Midway having like gone you know under and somebody else had to kind of pick up the series so yeah kind of gave them a little time to think about how to reinvent yeah I think Warner Brothers is I know Warner Brothers published it but um

127
00:09:31,638 --> 00:09:32,378
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

128
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,091
[SPEAKER_06]: But before that, they were cranking them out.

129
00:09:55,192 --> 00:09:57,313
[SPEAKER_06]: I think those games have always sold enough.

130
00:09:57,833 --> 00:09:59,194
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if they've ever sold big.

131
00:09:59,775 --> 00:10:03,497
[SPEAKER_06]: And it really seems like they're trying to get this new one in the series to sell big.

132
00:10:04,157 --> 00:10:04,758
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

133
00:10:04,798 --> 00:10:05,438
[SPEAKER_06]: Because we had what?

134
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:06,579
[SPEAKER_06]: We had Deadly Alliance.

135
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:08,500
[SPEAKER_06]: We had Annihilation.

136
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,801
[SPEAKER_06]: There was another one in the middle there.

137
00:10:09,861 --> 00:10:15,025
[SPEAKER_06]: The one that had the Mortal Kombat mini racing kart game was there too.

138
00:10:15,425 --> 00:10:16,246
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

139
00:10:16,386 --> 00:10:18,947
[SPEAKER_06]: And Annihilation was the one that had literally everybody.

140
00:10:19,568 --> 00:10:21,749
[SPEAKER_06]: And then that was kind of the last Mortal Kombat game.

141
00:10:21,789 --> 00:10:22,650
[SPEAKER_06]: But then they're like, oh.

142
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:45,895
[SPEAKER_09]: how do you save a franchise you do a reboot and you know that's literally what they've done literally like that's the story is built around a reboot yeah this is awesome the story mode if you play it from start to finish does the canon the official canon of the first three games and it sets you up for what Mortal Kombat 4 was lore wise at the end of the story mode

143
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:50,239
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go to our chatroom at chat.orangesoundradio.com for some comments.

144
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:56,240
[SPEAKER_06]: TigerClaw in our chatroom says the MK story mode is long if you take into account how difficult it was to beat Shao Kahn.

145
00:10:57,021 --> 00:11:01,422
[SPEAKER_06]: The best strategy was to teleport, uppercut, repeat that, and stay far away until time expires.

146
00:11:02,462 --> 00:11:04,182
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I did some lightning ball cheese on him.

147
00:11:04,683 --> 00:11:06,963
[SPEAKER_09]: Just get away, pew pew, I'm gonna pew pew you.

148
00:11:07,523 --> 00:11:10,224
[SPEAKER_09]: And then he just hopefully doesn't block enough of them to win.

149
00:11:10,686 --> 00:11:11,827
[SPEAKER_06]: Story Mode Story Mode Story Mode

150
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:57,266
[SPEAKER_06]: and Tiger Claw in our chatroom also fills in here with Rob it's like what they did with Star Trek due to the events of the beginning it creates an alternate timeline yeah I mean I don't think that's very spoilery I think that's pretty common knowledge like in story mode I believe people die I haven't gotten that far in my story mode but I believe like people do die I don't want to spoil that for you but you know there's you know big twists and events I believe characters become characters that didn't exist before yeah kind of interesting

151
00:11:57,426 --> 00:11:58,347
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

152
00:12:14,928 --> 00:12:27,243
[SPEAKER_06]: I really like, and just kind of going into my gaming week, obviously I played Mortal Kombat pretty extensively this week as well, and I do like how they have really brought a lot of the nostalgia.

153
00:12:27,563 --> 00:12:29,706
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I think you commenting like, let's...

154
00:12:30,326 --> 00:12:31,488
[SPEAKER_06]: Street Fighter 4 Street Fighter 2

155
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:49,691
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you bring it?

156
00:13:17,174 --> 00:13:18,257
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't bring it tonight.

157
00:13:18,717 --> 00:13:19,178
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

158
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:21,022
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't know you wanted to play it.

159
00:13:21,162 --> 00:13:25,270
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been watching all of the fatalities in the special, the unlocked characters and everything.

160
00:13:25,831 --> 00:13:28,577
[SPEAKER_02]: And I found out where all of the hidden coins are.

161
00:13:29,147 --> 00:13:33,830
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, there's a little guide online that we use to get every costume and every, yeah.

162
00:13:34,511 --> 00:13:43,497
[SPEAKER_09]: If you don't buy any of the extras in the crypt and you just do story mode from start to finish, you have 130,000 of the MK coins.

163
00:13:44,438 --> 00:13:46,299
[SPEAKER_09]: That's enough to get almost half of the goodies.

164
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,441
[SPEAKER_09]: It's enough to get all the costumes and the fatalities.

165
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:51,283
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool because I think that there's like another hidden 20,000.

166
00:13:51,323 --> 00:13:51,523
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

167
00:13:51,543 --> 00:13:51,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

168
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:56,384
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm being corrected by our chatroom.

169
00:13:56,424 --> 00:13:57,825
[SPEAKER_06]: Annihilation was the movie.

170
00:13:57,945 --> 00:13:59,146
[SPEAKER_06]: Armageddon was the game.

171
00:13:59,186 --> 00:14:00,046
[SPEAKER_06]: My bad, my bad.

172
00:14:00,086 --> 00:14:00,467
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, guys.

173
00:14:00,987 --> 00:14:01,567
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, Spazinator.

174
00:14:02,248 --> 00:14:03,368
[SPEAKER_06]: And Wyland chimed in with that, too.

175
00:14:03,689 --> 00:14:05,350
[SPEAKER_06]: And a comment from Randy in our chatroom.

176
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:08,412
[SPEAKER_06]: I felt like the story mode cleared up the events of the franchise.

177
00:14:08,492 --> 00:14:10,433
[SPEAKER_06]: It was definitely more confusing before.

178
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:16,677
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you know, Mortal Kombat kind of always felt like one of those games where they had to kind of write the story to fit what they wanted to do.

179
00:14:17,358 --> 00:14:19,339
[SPEAKER_06]: And so there were all these weird things going on.

180
00:14:19,739 --> 00:14:21,121
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

181
00:14:37,299 --> 00:14:40,662
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, just goes to show, don't ever base your opinion of a game off the demo.

182
00:14:40,762 --> 00:14:41,843
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't ever, ever, ever do that.

183
00:14:42,143 --> 00:14:43,945
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it was actually really good.

184
00:14:44,325 --> 00:14:45,826
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've been having a good time with it.

185
00:14:46,227 --> 00:14:49,529
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there's such a great variety in characters that they've brought in.

186
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:53,413
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty much every single fighter from 1, 2, and 3 are in it, right?

187
00:14:53,493 --> 00:14:57,016
[SPEAKER_06]: With maybe some very minor, like the boss characters, not all of them are there.

188
00:14:57,356 --> 00:14:59,678
[SPEAKER_06]: But otherwise, I think every single person...

189
00:15:06,127 --> 00:15:07,807
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they all show up in the story.

190
00:15:07,927 --> 00:15:09,728
[SPEAKER_02]: But they had fatalities for him.

191
00:15:09,988 --> 00:15:10,288
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, really?

192
00:15:10,428 --> 00:15:10,668
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

193
00:15:11,428 --> 00:15:18,290
[SPEAKER_09]: The big centaur dude with the big horse, I think he was the boss of MK3, he's in it in a cutscene, but you don't play as him.

194
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:22,010
[SPEAKER_09]: And then Quan Chi from 4 was brought in, so he's playable.

195
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:24,331
[SPEAKER_09]: But otherwise, the people from 4 aren't in it yet.

196
00:15:24,711 --> 00:15:35,093
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, although DLC might change some of that, because a character that was introduced in Deadly Alliance, who's actually one of my favorite characters, Kenshi, is one of the first download characters, the blind ninja guy.

197
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:36,493
[SPEAKER_02]: I was watching the Fatalities for Kratos

198
00:15:53,960 --> 00:16:21,996
[SPEAKER_06]: mm-hmm yeah Kratos is in the game pretty hard he obviously fits right in yeah I gotta say though like you know he just he plays like any other character which I think is a compliment I mean you don't want a character like Kratos to be gimmicky or stick out like a sore thumb but I mean like the whole like painting his body white and everything well Quan Chi does that shit too so he kind of fits right in with everybody else it's a better promotional exclusive thing than I don't know Darth Vader and Yoda and Soul Calibur 4 mm-hmm

199
00:16:22,436 --> 00:16:26,798
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and also, the other thing that... Who was it?

200
00:16:27,678 --> 00:16:28,778
[SPEAKER_02]: I just lost my train of thought.

201
00:16:28,858 --> 00:16:36,041
[SPEAKER_09]: It was somebody else that's in there that... Noob and Ermac were... Ermac's hardcore.

202
00:16:36,081 --> 00:16:40,162
[SPEAKER_09]: ...were fandom rumors that they actually made real characters, yeah.

203
00:16:40,481 --> 00:16:44,443
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that Ermac's fatality with the spikes.

204
00:16:44,884 --> 00:16:45,084
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

205
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:46,084
[SPEAKER_02]: That one's really cool.

206
00:16:46,545 --> 00:16:50,687
[SPEAKER_06]: LeoShed is in our chatroom saying, no Rain, otherwise they would have all of Trilogy.

207
00:16:50,747 --> 00:16:53,669
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Rain is one of the most notable characters that's missing.

208
00:16:53,729 --> 00:17:01,334
[SPEAKER_06]: But to be honest, because they've done so much with the other ninjas, like, you know, Cyrax and Sektor are not just palette swaps.

209
00:17:01,514 --> 00:17:03,635
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, you know, they are fully developed ninjas.

210
00:17:04,496 --> 00:17:08,158
[SPEAKER_06]: They start in story mode as humans and you can unlock their human forms.

211
00:17:08,438 --> 00:17:10,340
[SPEAKER_06]: So they are all very different characters.

212
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:17,465
[SPEAKER_06]: So I can see why they probably cut Rain because while he was a cool character, he was really tacked into Trilogy.

213
00:17:17,765 --> 00:17:18,566
[SPEAKER_06]: He was purple.

214
00:17:18,886 --> 00:17:23,629
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, he was the purple palette swap that had a couple cool moves with a neat name.

215
00:17:23,889 --> 00:17:26,912
[SPEAKER_06]: Otherwise, he was really forced in the story.

216
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:28,813
[SPEAKER_06]: I would bet he's DLC later on though.

217
00:17:29,233 --> 00:17:30,254
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember what I was going to say.

218
00:17:31,234 --> 00:17:44,783
[SPEAKER_02]: One of Shang Tsung's fatalities was actually his DC, his Mortal Kombat versus DC fatality, except it's the whole thing, because they cut it to where you only see him turn into a clown, and then you don't see the other person explode.

219
00:17:44,963 --> 00:17:45,143
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

220
00:17:45,283 --> 00:17:46,544
[SPEAKER_02]: They showed the full fatality.

221
00:17:47,164 --> 00:17:47,604
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

222
00:17:47,624 --> 00:17:49,525
[SPEAKER_02]: So, because people are like, what happened?

223
00:17:49,565 --> 00:17:50,446
[SPEAKER_02]: So they actually put that in there.

224
00:17:50,706 --> 00:17:54,168
[SPEAKER_06]: The fatalities in this game are a little silly as they're supposed to be very over the top.

225
00:17:54,389 --> 00:17:55,569
[SPEAKER_06]: Babalities are in there.

226
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:57,111
[SPEAKER_01]: The babalities are cute!

227
00:17:57,251 --> 00:17:59,892
[SPEAKER_06]: But friendships are not, which kind of surprised me.

228
00:18:00,033 --> 00:18:00,693
[SPEAKER_06]: I was very sad.

229
00:18:00,773 --> 00:18:02,754
[SPEAKER_06]: No animalities or any of the other weird stuff either.

230
00:18:02,774 --> 00:18:04,216
[SPEAKER_06]: I was really sad friendships weren't there.

231
00:18:04,756 --> 00:18:05,937
[SPEAKER_06]: I always loved those in Mortal Kombat 2.

232
00:18:06,577 --> 00:18:08,479
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

233
00:18:27,032 --> 00:18:28,433
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's definitely influence.

234
00:18:28,473 --> 00:18:29,893
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's really cool.

235
00:18:30,113 --> 00:18:33,215
[SPEAKER_06]: It adds to the battle exactly what it does in Street Fighter IV.

236
00:18:33,355 --> 00:18:38,677
[SPEAKER_06]: If you are behind, this gives you a chance to really level the playing field if your opponent has a moment of weakness.

237
00:18:39,017 --> 00:18:42,419
[SPEAKER_06]: And the x-ray attacks look really cool, and it makes the battle flow really well.

238
00:18:42,759 --> 00:18:48,041
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that's where this game really shines, is that the battles flow so well.

239
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:53,784
[SPEAKER_06]: They're fun to play, and the fatalities give that sense of edge to it.

240
00:18:53,804 --> 00:18:54,664
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot at stake.

241
00:18:55,284 --> 00:19:17,806
[SPEAKER_06]: um and then you know where this Mortal Kombat really shines is where a lot of the prior Mortal Kombat games have really shined and that is uh the robustness of what is offered in the title you've got your story mode you've got your challenge ladder with what like 300 challenges you've got the crypt thing which the crypt thing's been done better in other versions of the game I think but whatever it's still there

242
00:19:19,326 --> 00:19:45,093
[SPEAKER_06]: you know you have different modes to play and the tag team thing kind of comes out of nowhere too they kind of took that whole idea from I guess you could say Marvel vs. Capcom or whatever but now you have teams of two and you can do assists and all that stuff so it's pretty cool it's like Mortal Kombat has really been invigorated it's been infused with some of the best parts of other fighters and it's made for a pretty awesome experience one of my favorite Mortal Kombat games in recent memory the best one of all time is

243
00:19:46,033 --> 00:19:46,953
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's still two.

244
00:19:47,473 --> 00:19:48,254
[SPEAKER_06]: Two beta.

245
00:19:48,474 --> 00:19:51,955
[SPEAKER_06]: It's one of those that's going to be hard to top.

246
00:19:52,015 --> 00:19:55,416
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's worth checking out, if nothing else.

247
00:19:56,056 --> 00:20:02,178
[SPEAKER_06]: And a lot of people like to point and laugh at Mortal Kombat in the fighting world, but I think this one shows that there's a lot here to take seriously.

248
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:03,558
[SPEAKER_02]: Two beta was great.

249
00:20:04,018 --> 00:20:04,298
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it?

250
00:20:04,338 --> 00:20:05,919
[SPEAKER_02]: With Katana's infinite combo.

251
00:20:05,939 --> 00:20:05,979
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

252
00:20:10,238 --> 00:20:13,879
[SPEAKER_06]: TigerClaw in our chatroom says, Rob, regarding animalities, at least one of them is in there.

253
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:15,340
[SPEAKER_06]: It's one of Liu Kang's fatalities.

254
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:19,881
[SPEAKER_06]: That's true, but wasn't it also a fatality in Mortal Kombat 2?

255
00:20:20,322 --> 00:20:22,802
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's what inspired it, not necessarily the animalities.

256
00:20:23,483 --> 00:20:25,083
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, other games I played this week.

257
00:20:25,103 --> 00:20:35,167
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to talk just about Mortal Kombat because I haven't had a chance to play Mortal Kombat online because of certain outages, but I have had a chance to check out Portal 2.

258
00:20:36,167 --> 00:20:54,042
[SPEAKER_06]: Portal 2 is, you know, I played the first game and played, you know, that game pretty extensively and it was always a pretty cool concept and, you know, when I heard they were making a sequel, I knew it was going to be pretty interesting and I've been playing through the single player mode and I really don't know what to say.

259
00:20:54,302 --> 00:20:55,303
[SPEAKER_06]: I honestly think...

260
00:20:56,624 --> 00:21:06,147
[SPEAKER_06]: games like Super Mario Brothers, Final Fantasy 7, games that have been like landmark for that generation.

261
00:21:06,647 --> 00:21:09,148
[SPEAKER_06]: I honestly think Portal 2 fits into that for this generation.

262
00:21:09,308 --> 00:21:10,849
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this is like a...

263
00:21:12,029 --> 00:21:13,090
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching!

264
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:37,370
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

265
00:22:01,596 --> 00:22:11,966
[SPEAKER_06]: I was really expecting it to just be kind of a continuation of Portal 1 where you would just have more test chambers and explore the story a little more.

266
00:22:12,026 --> 00:22:16,010
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's much more here than just more test chambers.

267
00:22:16,471 --> 00:22:17,712
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's all I'm really going to say.

268
00:22:18,152 --> 00:22:19,253
[SPEAKER_02]: Although there are a lot of those.

269
00:22:19,433 --> 00:22:22,415
[SPEAKER_06]: There are a lot of those, but there's much more.

270
00:22:22,535 --> 00:22:31,461
[SPEAKER_06]: This game digs beneath the surface, and I don't just mean beneath the surface of the test chambers, which you do get to see as well, which is really cool.

271
00:22:32,362 --> 00:22:38,686
[SPEAKER_06]: GLaDOS as a character is legendary in the world of video games.

272
00:22:40,407 --> 00:22:46,191
[SPEAKER_06]: I have done the blue repulsion gel a couple times.

273
00:22:46,431 --> 00:22:47,872
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've seen Potato?

274
00:22:48,513 --> 00:22:51,575
[SPEAKER_06]: The Big Mutated Potato is Supposed to be Shell's Project

275
00:23:19,948 --> 00:23:20,248
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

276
00:23:20,268 --> 00:23:20,588
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, wow.

277
00:23:21,629 --> 00:23:21,929
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

278
00:23:23,871 --> 00:23:27,514
[SPEAKER_06]: So, anyway, some comments in our chatroom, chat.orange.radio.com.

279
00:23:27,875 --> 00:23:33,920
[SPEAKER_06]: Randy in our chatroom says, Watching Portal for the first time made me think, how does someone have the mental capacity to figure out these puzzles?

280
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,421
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, a lot of it's trial and error.

281
00:23:35,501 --> 00:23:41,867
[SPEAKER_06]: I noticed that the second game really limits where you can put portals more than the first game did, and that's part of the puzzles.

282
00:23:42,207 --> 00:23:42,627
[SPEAKER_06]: But, I mean...

283
00:23:43,528 --> 00:23:50,511
[SPEAKER_06]: They've added all this other stuff into it, like the lasers, the light bridges, the gel is a huge thing.

284
00:23:50,531 --> 00:23:53,072
[SPEAKER_06]: I got stuck on one puzzle because of that stupid gel.

285
00:23:53,112 --> 00:23:59,055
[SPEAKER_06]: I couldn't figure out how to... I didn't figure out that you could actually make gel fly through the walls that destroy things.

286
00:23:59,115 --> 00:24:00,516
[SPEAKER_06]: Otherwise, I would have figured it out a lot sooner.

287
00:24:01,216 --> 00:24:03,177
[SPEAKER_06]: and just crazy stuff.

288
00:24:03,637 --> 00:24:10,100
[SPEAKER_06]: You really have to look around for surfaces that could be a mile high up for you to fling a portal onto.

289
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:14,842
[SPEAKER_06]: It is really an experience to play a game like Portal.

290
00:24:14,862 --> 00:24:17,242
[SPEAKER_06]: I really don't know what else to say.

291
00:24:17,303 --> 00:24:20,284
[SPEAKER_06]: The game is outstanding and it's well worth your money.

292
00:24:21,264 --> 00:24:27,748
[SPEAKER_06]: If you haven't bought it yet, I guess you already know this is probably the type of game that maybe just isn't for you for whatever reason or, you know, obviously economical, whatever stuff.

293
00:24:27,908 --> 00:24:29,609
[SPEAKER_06]: $60 is still a huge investment.

294
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:32,751
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't know what else to say.

295
00:24:32,791 --> 00:24:35,973
[SPEAKER_06]: I think most people who want it already went and got it first day.

296
00:24:36,313 --> 00:24:37,434
[SPEAKER_06]: The Steam integration is great.

297
00:24:37,714 --> 00:24:41,297
[SPEAKER_06]: I was really surprised at how well Steam integrates with the PlayStation 3.

298
00:24:42,117 --> 00:24:46,559
[SPEAKER_06]: But you can hit select, then it brings up the Steam thing, and it's just like being logged into Steam.

299
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,240
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what else to say.

300
00:24:48,601 --> 00:24:49,621
[SPEAKER_06]: It was pretty seamless.

301
00:24:49,641 --> 00:24:55,324
[SPEAKER_06]: You connect your PlayStation Network account to Steam, and then that's it.

302
00:24:55,484 --> 00:25:03,028
[SPEAKER_06]: You can hit select, and I can see all my Steam friends and who's on, and it's just like I'm playing another Steam game, but it's on my PlayStation 3.

303
00:25:03,989 --> 00:25:09,632
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I was wondering, if someone picked this up, used, they wouldn't be able to get the Steam...

304
00:25:12,671 --> 00:25:13,212
[SPEAKER_02]: Link, would they?

305
00:25:14,052 --> 00:25:17,656
[SPEAKER_06]: There is a card that comes with the game that has the code on it.

306
00:25:17,696 --> 00:25:19,778
[SPEAKER_06]: So sadly, no, you wouldn't be able to get it.

307
00:25:20,138 --> 00:25:22,180
[SPEAKER_06]: You'd have to buy it new in order to get to both games.

308
00:25:22,821 --> 00:25:30,027
[SPEAKER_06]: And it says somehow that... It says on the back of the box, you cannot play co-op on your PC and PS3.

309
00:25:31,028 --> 00:25:31,369
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

310
00:25:31,469 --> 00:25:33,070
[SPEAKER_06]: See, I haven't really explored that yet.

311
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:34,131
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe somebody in our chat knows.

312
00:25:34,972 --> 00:25:37,454
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would imagine a lot of that is because of the Steam hookup.

313
00:25:37,935 --> 00:25:42,960
[SPEAKER_06]: If I log into Steam on my PS3, it's not going to let me do it on my PC as well to play the same game.

314
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:46,743
[SPEAKER_06]: But what would happen if I have two PlayStation 3 accounts?

315
00:25:47,003 --> 00:25:49,826
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, for example, Salacious Pop uses my PlayStation...

316
00:25:51,447 --> 00:26:10,124
[SPEAKER_06]: 3 as well what if he connected that to his Steam and then played on my PS3 and then I played Steam on my computer maybe that would work I don't know because I can't imagine that this discs are imprinted with the serial number somehow so unless hooking up Steam hooks up the whole console to that Steam ID I would think you could have that

317
00:26:10,845 --> 00:26:11,146
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

318
00:26:12,668 --> 00:26:15,231
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to be honest.

319
00:26:15,271 --> 00:26:16,773
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't even really played it on Steam.

320
00:26:16,994 --> 00:26:19,177
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been completely satiated with the PS3 version.

321
00:26:19,237 --> 00:26:21,099
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't really need the Steam version.

322
00:26:21,159 --> 00:26:21,960
[SPEAKER_06]: It's nice to have.

323
00:26:22,541 --> 00:26:25,165
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a cool little bonus, but I didn't really need it.

324
00:26:26,564 --> 00:26:29,546
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I'm waiting until I can play it on PC because I'm like that.

325
00:26:30,487 --> 00:26:32,048
[SPEAKER_09]: I need the mouse and WASD.

326
00:26:32,348 --> 00:26:35,931
[SPEAKER_02]: After playing both versions of Portal, it really is a lot easier to play on the PC.

327
00:26:36,371 --> 00:26:40,594
[SPEAKER_06]: See, but see, and this all goes back to joystick versus mouse and keyboard.

328
00:26:40,954 --> 00:26:42,435
[SPEAKER_06]: Some people prefer mouse and keyboard.

329
00:26:42,536 --> 00:26:44,637
[SPEAKER_06]: I love the DualShock controller for playing it.

330
00:26:44,737 --> 00:26:45,298
[SPEAKER_06]: It's awesome.

331
00:26:45,818 --> 00:26:46,358
[SPEAKER_06]: Great for me.

332
00:26:46,739 --> 00:26:46,839
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

333
00:26:49,071 --> 00:26:52,015
[SPEAKER_06]: Spazinator in our chatroom says, is the cake still a lie in Portal 2?

334
00:26:52,876 --> 00:26:57,323
[SPEAKER_06]: No, there is one joke that is blink and you miss it sort of thing.

335
00:26:57,643 --> 00:27:02,990
[SPEAKER_06]: And I like that they did that because they didn't try to keep the same joke going through the whole thing.

336
00:27:03,191 --> 00:27:04,072
[SPEAKER_06]: I really like that.

337
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:27,422
[SPEAKER_06]: GLaDOS has some new insults and some of them are real good like she consistently makes fat jokes about you which are just outstanding I love the GLaDOS cutdowns like some of them are really harsh all I'll say there's one surprise yes the surprise when the confetti blows I was dying dying alright let's see next time there will be real confetti

338
00:27:30,163 --> 00:27:40,372
[SPEAKER_06]: Go to our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com Bonds006 says, Like the Xbox 360 recovery game tag ability from Sony?

339
00:27:40,473 --> 00:27:40,933
[SPEAKER_06]: No, Rob.

340
00:27:40,973 --> 00:27:41,534
[SPEAKER_06]: Stop hoping.

341
00:27:42,114 --> 00:27:43,916
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think that's exactly what I'm talking about.

342
00:27:44,036 --> 00:27:46,859
[SPEAKER_06]: Although, yeah, it is a little weird that you can...

343
00:27:49,738 --> 00:27:53,362
[SPEAKER_06]: We're having this problem now that we have two Xbox 360s in our house.

344
00:27:54,063 --> 00:27:59,289
[SPEAKER_06]: If we put the live on one, we have to migrate the account to play on the other Xbox every time.

345
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:00,711
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a little irritating.

346
00:28:01,632 --> 00:28:02,072
[SPEAKER_06]: It's weird.

347
00:28:03,334 --> 00:28:06,538
[SPEAKER_06]: Frisbee in our chatroom says the console versions should let you use keyboard and mouse.

348
00:28:08,032 --> 00:28:08,512
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

349
00:28:32,362 --> 00:28:33,043
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching!

350
00:28:51,056 --> 00:28:53,056
[SPEAKER_06]: All the little modes they put in that.

351
00:28:53,977 --> 00:28:57,178
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki kind of reviewed the title on the show before, so I'm not going to rehash everything.

352
00:28:57,218 --> 00:29:01,700
[SPEAKER_06]: But I do like that they've put in a street pass feature where you can fight things.

353
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:05,122
[SPEAKER_06]: It gives you incentive to keep playing, so you can collect these little trophies.

354
00:29:05,742 --> 00:29:12,385
[SPEAKER_06]: They're different from achievements, but the little trophies are what you use in street pass mode to help fight other people and so forth.

355
00:29:12,825 --> 00:29:27,853
[SPEAKER_06]: and 3DS as a system I'm liking it so far I feel like there's so much more potential there that we're going to unlock what in May when they do some of the patches there's a lot in the interface where you hit the button and it says this feature is not yet available it will be installed through a system update

356
00:29:28,573 --> 00:29:29,634
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

357
00:29:56,556 --> 00:30:00,279
[SPEAKER_09]: And I had some issues with the facial recognition.

358
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:13,831
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll make your little me avatar by taking a picture of yourself, you square your head in the frame, and it thinks that I have really huge jowls.

359
00:30:15,232 --> 00:30:16,813
[SPEAKER_09]: My head looked like a bell.

360
00:30:16,913 --> 00:30:19,975
[SPEAKER_06]: My 3DS is apparently GLaDOS because it was calling you fat.

361
00:30:20,176 --> 00:30:20,736
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it was.

362
00:30:21,196 --> 00:30:22,877
[SPEAKER_09]: I think because I'm rocking a beard right now.

363
00:30:24,439 --> 00:30:27,240
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think it just thought that my facial hair was face.

364
00:30:27,861 --> 00:30:29,182
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's like, yeah.

365
00:30:29,778 --> 00:30:30,078
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

366
00:30:54,822 --> 00:30:56,983
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so gosh, I think I've covered about everything.

367
00:30:57,223 --> 00:31:00,524
[SPEAKER_06]: I have Final Fantasy 4, the complete edition on order as well.

368
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:06,446
[SPEAKER_06]: I was frugal in my shopping and I went on Amazon.com and bought Mortal Kombat and Portal 2.

369
00:31:06,886 --> 00:31:10,848
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I got like $20 credit for buying one and $10 credit for buying the other.

370
00:31:11,568 --> 00:31:16,551
[SPEAKER_06]: I usually don't give shoutouts to retail chains like that because, you know, we're a commercial free show.

371
00:31:16,871 --> 00:31:19,052
[SPEAKER_06]: But I just got to say, as a gamer, I was pretty impressed.

372
00:31:19,352 --> 00:31:20,953
[SPEAKER_06]: They only charged me four bucks for shipping.

373
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:22,754
[SPEAKER_06]: They had the games there on release day.

374
00:31:23,034 --> 00:31:28,397
[SPEAKER_06]: I got $30 worth of free credit, which I used to buy the Final Fantasy IV Complete Collection, which was the other game I wanted this week.

375
00:31:28,477 --> 00:31:29,337
[SPEAKER_06]: So, win!

376
00:31:30,558 --> 00:31:31,498
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, I'm all for good deals.

377
00:31:31,939 --> 00:31:32,319
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

378
00:31:33,652 --> 00:31:43,981
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's see, going to our chatroom again, chat.orangeloungeradio.com, Bonds006 in our chat agrees, yeah, the me on the 3DDS does make you look not like yourself.

379
00:31:45,362 --> 00:31:59,074
[SPEAKER_06]: Tigerclaw says, regarding the street pass, so far it's been working, I go about four miles from street pass, but the fine me still, oh, I don't know, oh, I think I got about four me's from street pass, but the fine me still won't let me use them.

380
00:31:59,995 --> 00:32:04,218
[SPEAKER_06]: How many StreetPass Miis do you need in order for Find Me to work without buying the heroes?

381
00:32:04,538 --> 00:32:05,098
[SPEAKER_06]: Good question.

382
00:32:05,138 --> 00:32:06,039
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't figured that out yet.

383
00:32:06,079 --> 00:32:09,361
[SPEAKER_06]: I just got the 3DS last night, so I have yet to run into people.

384
00:32:09,401 --> 00:32:14,243
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't gone to the mall or anything or a place where other gamers are where I've had StreetPass.

385
00:32:14,584 --> 00:32:16,605
[SPEAKER_06]: I've just bought the Miis.

386
00:32:16,805 --> 00:32:23,429
[SPEAKER_06]: And what I mean by that, the 3DS has a built-in game called Find Me, and it's a little chibi role-playing game.

387
00:32:23,689 --> 00:32:24,830
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

388
00:32:51,806 --> 00:32:52,307
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

389
00:33:12,712 --> 00:33:14,835
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so let's move on.

390
00:33:15,656 --> 00:33:19,961
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, BlackWolf in our chatroom says, I got one Mii and I used him on Find Mii.

391
00:33:20,301 --> 00:33:23,945
[SPEAKER_06]: So I guess maybe there's something the Tigerclaw missed in that.

392
00:33:24,005 --> 00:33:24,366
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

393
00:33:24,846 --> 00:33:26,728
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, I got to try and get more Mii's.

394
00:33:26,748 --> 00:33:29,892
[SPEAKER_06]: I was hoping Loki would be here so we could street pass the DSs, but oh well.

395
00:33:30,312 --> 00:33:31,574
[SPEAKER_06]: Easter's more important, I suppose.

396
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:38,772
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, we're going to move into some gaming news, but first some quick plugs for where you can find us around the internet.

397
00:33:38,812 --> 00:33:45,495
[SPEAKER_06]: We are on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR, as well as Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

398
00:33:46,035 --> 00:33:50,056
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, once again, we do tape live at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.

399
00:33:50,316 --> 00:33:52,297
[SPEAKER_06]: If you've never joined us for a live show, why not?

400
00:33:53,581 --> 00:33:55,002
[SPEAKER_06]: You should sometime at some point.

401
00:33:55,282 --> 00:33:56,963
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's get into tonight's gaming news.

402
00:33:57,263 --> 00:33:59,764
[SPEAKER_06]: So Pop's going to start us off tonight since he's filling in for Loki.

403
00:34:00,224 --> 00:34:14,571
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a huge story that's been covered most major avenues for gaming news, and that is the fact that on Wednesday night, the PlayStation Network went down like a drunk, vicarious frat boy at a Jack Jansen concert.

404
00:34:14,631 --> 00:34:15,691
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just gone.

405
00:34:16,091 --> 00:34:16,572
[SPEAKER_09]: It's gone.

406
00:34:19,173 --> 00:34:28,038
[SPEAKER_09]: Wednesday night, no PSN, no store, no curiosity store or anything like that.

407
00:34:28,499 --> 00:34:34,562
[SPEAKER_09]: And Sony confirmed that it was because of an external intrusion, which means they got to haxed.

408
00:34:35,503 --> 00:34:40,746
[SPEAKER_09]: Someone got into the system in a bad way and brought the whole thing down.

409
00:34:40,846 --> 00:34:43,408
[SPEAKER_09]: And I guess I'm given the statement that...

410
00:34:45,729 --> 00:34:51,619
[SPEAKER_09]: Sibold put out it sounds like they're completely rebuilding their

411
00:34:52,918 --> 00:34:54,078
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

412
00:35:16,064 --> 00:35:42,594
[SPEAKER_06]: and the Portal 2 obviously you know they the Gabe Newell got up there at E3 and said okay my bad on PlayStation my bad guys it's actually going to be the system you're going to want to own Portal 2 on remember that and so and obviously with the Steam integration it's pretty great and so I kind of wonder how that plays into it like maybe just the fact that now all of a sudden all these folks who maybe own both systems were like opting for the PS3 versions and

413
00:35:42,795 --> 00:35:46,250
[SPEAKER_06]: in conjunction with whatever else is going on behind the scenes brought it down.

414
00:35:47,543 --> 00:35:52,924
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I'm sure you know there are people at Valve that, I don't want to say they're pissed, but it's there.

415
00:35:53,224 --> 00:36:07,807
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a huge release for Valve, and the authoritative console version, you can't do co-op on it right now because of Sony, so I'm sure they've got all these developers, not just Valve, breathing down their neck, going, how did this happen?

416
00:36:08,327 --> 00:36:15,668
[SPEAKER_09]: Consumers are worried that if the hack was this bad that it would bring down their entire network for five days.

417
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:18,130
[SPEAKER_09]: Do they have access to customer records?

418
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:21,493
[SPEAKER_09]: Because a lot of people have their credit cards saved because they like just the one-click purchase.

419
00:36:22,033 --> 00:36:27,198
[SPEAKER_06]: I got to admit, that makes me very nervous because, yeah, all right, mine's on there.

420
00:36:27,538 --> 00:36:33,623
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm a little worried about this because, you know, if that information got out, I want to know.

421
00:36:34,624 --> 00:36:38,868
[SPEAKER_06]: And I need Sony to be communicating a little better than like, yeah, we're down because we got hacked.

422
00:36:38,948 --> 00:36:39,609
[SPEAKER_06]: No shit.

423
00:36:40,209 --> 00:36:41,430
[SPEAKER_06]: We all read the internet.

424
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:45,753
[SPEAKER_06]: Even CNN was reporting about how Anonymous was attacking PlayStation Network.

425
00:36:46,173 --> 00:36:53,538
[SPEAKER_06]: And whether they're responsible for this or not, I mean, Sony has an obligation to tell me exactly what information of mine is out there.

426
00:36:53,718 --> 00:36:59,842
[SPEAKER_09]: California has some pretty strict consumer rights laws involving statements made about their information.

427
00:36:59,862 --> 00:37:02,364
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the federal government has some pretty strict laws on that stuff.

428
00:37:02,404 --> 00:37:03,445
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not just California.

429
00:37:03,485 --> 00:37:05,146
[SPEAKER_06]: Many states do.

430
00:37:05,206 --> 00:37:06,807
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, I mean, obviously.

431
00:37:07,267 --> 00:37:09,349
[SPEAKER_06]: But the bummer is, I think,

432
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:13,373
[SPEAKER_06]: You can report up to 90 days after the incident.

433
00:37:14,154 --> 00:37:15,255
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm sorry, Sony.

434
00:37:15,275 --> 00:37:16,396
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to know now.

435
00:37:16,517 --> 00:37:17,878
[SPEAKER_06]: Stop giving all this fluff.

436
00:37:18,038 --> 00:37:19,720
[SPEAKER_06]: What exactly is happening?

437
00:37:20,061 --> 00:37:21,722
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going on four to five days now.

438
00:37:22,263 --> 00:37:22,804
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, and...

439
00:37:25,426 --> 00:37:32,231
[SPEAKER_06]: We kind of joke about how on this show a lot of times the system will go down for a day or two and it's always like nobody ever remembers.

440
00:37:32,611 --> 00:37:36,474
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody ever remembers that Xbox went down right after Halo 3 came out too.

441
00:37:37,815 --> 00:37:42,137
[SPEAKER_06]: Gamers pretty much overlook this stuff because once it's fixed then they can play their games.

442
00:37:42,558 --> 00:37:47,801
[SPEAKER_06]: But this is starting to go on one of those things where it's getting harder and harder to say you're just going to easily forget this.

443
00:37:48,182 --> 00:37:52,244
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially if we find out that our information was at risk.

444
00:37:52,544 --> 00:37:54,486
[SPEAKER_06]: That is going to be a huge

445
00:37:56,770 --> 00:38:04,046
[SPEAKER_06]: and GameStop will breathe a huge sigh of relief because they'll be open that much longer.

446
00:38:04,716 --> 00:38:34,063
[SPEAKER_09]: I think with the Xbox they've had the gold which is the for pay platform you know for Xbox Live that's been around longer more people depend on that for the co-op play and for Netflix whereas the PSN you know you post your trophies and you do some matching service on it but PSN because it doesn't have I mean if you don't buy the download games from PSN there's really no reason for them to have your credit card information whereas on the Xbox Live service you need a credit card for gold period

447
00:38:35,224 --> 00:38:52,622
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually don't put any of my information in those if I can help it because with Xbox you put it in there they will find a way that even if you unintentionally press something they're still going to charge you so it's best not to have it in there at all just buy the points through the internet

448
00:38:52,842 --> 00:39:03,754
[SPEAKER_09]: For the PlayStation Network, what I would do is I would, I don't know if you can do this anymore, but I would go onto the site, the website, PlayStation Network, put some money in my bucket or whatever, then buy the game through the PS3.

449
00:39:04,174 --> 00:39:07,538
[SPEAKER_09]: That way I can do a one-time transaction and they don't have my credit card saved in there.

450
00:39:08,139 --> 00:39:09,300
[SPEAKER_09]: Because otherwise I don't trust it.

451
00:39:09,502 --> 00:39:09,982
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

452
00:39:27,308 --> 00:39:33,890
[SPEAKER_06]: This is really interesting because this just pulls back this whole other layer of what is anonymous all about?

453
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:42,993
[SPEAKER_06]: Because of the fact that they don't have a face, they are anonymous, so to speak, it is so easy for the media to blame them for this, which is what's happening.

454
00:39:43,013 --> 00:39:47,794
[SPEAKER_06]: They may not be responsible, but they're getting the blame for this because there's no one to defend anonymous because they're anonymous.

455
00:39:48,054 --> 00:39:49,615
[SPEAKER_02]: And that adds actually to their notoriety.

456
00:39:50,885 --> 00:39:53,026
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, as I understand it... They're probably eating it up.

457
00:39:53,567 --> 00:40:01,732
[SPEAKER_09]: As I understand it, a couple weeks ago when the Geohots verdict came down, they did a couple days of DDoS attacks, which is where they flood the system with requests.

458
00:40:02,272 --> 00:40:02,853
[SPEAKER_09]: That was it.

459
00:40:03,353 --> 00:40:12,519
[SPEAKER_09]: So this thing that just brought the whole thing down like a house of cards, they're like, it's not whoever the people that... Yeah, whoever the mouthpiece is, whoever's calling the shots...

460
00:40:12,839 --> 00:40:13,339
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

461
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:30,652
[SPEAKER_06]: This isn't the notoriety that they want.

462
00:40:30,732 --> 00:40:36,175
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't want to be responsible for the consumers because that's who they were trying to defend in the first place with this whole Geohots thing.

463
00:40:36,655 --> 00:40:44,820
[SPEAKER_06]: But unfortunately, how easy is it for the not-as-tech-savvy media, mainstream media, to just say, well, it's Anonymous' fault.

464
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:48,522
[SPEAKER_06]: They said they put out these videos and Anonymous, Anonymous, Anonymous, Anonymous.

465
00:40:48,882 --> 00:40:53,124
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, maybe they like having their name out there, but I don't necessarily think this is what they wanted their name on.

466
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:55,945
[SPEAKER_06]: But because Anonymous has no mouthpiece...

467
00:40:57,046 --> 00:41:00,269
[SPEAKER_06]: This could be a whole subset of the group that's doing this.

468
00:41:00,529 --> 00:41:02,150
[SPEAKER_06]: And we just don't know.

469
00:41:03,111 --> 00:41:03,752
[SPEAKER_06]: It's interesting.

470
00:41:03,872 --> 00:41:08,976
[SPEAKER_06]: That whole politics or whatever you want to call it behind it is fascinating.

471
00:41:09,757 --> 00:41:16,723
[SPEAKER_09]: And just to get to the meat and potatoes of this story, Patrick Sebald, who is the head of PR for Sony, this is his actual statement on it.

472
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:25,030
[SPEAKER_09]: Quote, "...an external intrusion on our system has affected our PlayStation Network and Curiosity Services."

473
00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:42,485
[SPEAKER_09]: in order to conduct a thorough investigation and to verify the smooth and secure operation of our network services going forward we turned off PlayStation Network and Curiosity Services on the evening of Wednesday, April 20th providing quality entertainment services to our customers and partners is our utmost priority

474
00:41:45,074 --> 00:41:59,510
[SPEAKER_06]: that's their that's all they got to say about it part of me is kind of like something really bad happened this is much more than a DDOS attack because if that was the case we would not be sitting down talking about reconstructing the whole fucking thing

475
00:42:00,751 --> 00:42:21,899
[SPEAKER_06]: during Easter weekend which is the start of spring break when you have two of your biggest titles out that is why I'm sitting here going I think private information was breached and I think it's going to come out in the next week that that's what happened and that kind of worries me like otherwise your timing is just ridiculous Sony

476
00:42:22,199 --> 00:42:32,464
[SPEAKER_09]: As someone with a sales analyst background, the fact that their store is offline, like, oh yeah, that's no revenue for a week.

477
00:42:33,724 --> 00:42:40,107
[SPEAKER_09]: Even a company as big as Sony that makes billions of dollars a year, if you don't make a penny for five days, you will feel it.

478
00:42:40,687 --> 00:42:42,188
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, it's pretty serious.

479
00:42:42,748 --> 00:42:45,129
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well let's move on with some more stories.

480
00:42:45,189 --> 00:42:57,856
[SPEAKER_06]: This one kind of came up while we were off last week, but it's just, speaking of demons with multiple heads or whatever you want to call it, this is a story that's just been going on and on over the past couple weeks that, you know, we didn't have a show last week, and that is...

481
00:42:58,536 --> 00:43:01,157
[SPEAKER_06]: The rumored new Nintendo console.

482
00:43:01,257 --> 00:43:07,919
[SPEAKER_06]: A new Nintendo console is rumored to be debuting at E3 this June, supposedly launching in 2012.

483
00:43:08,339 --> 00:43:11,400
[SPEAKER_06]: It's supposed to be more powerful, obviously, than the Wii.

484
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:23,383
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of talk about how it's supposed to be scary similar to the Xbox 360, where if you develop a game for the 360, it's supposed to be just that much easier for you to develop for whatever this new Nintendo console is.

485
00:43:23,903 --> 00:43:41,308
[SPEAKER_06]: um these uh leaks are coming from Game Informer who I believe was sorting a French site in their uh news which was the same French site that I believe broke the story on the PSP Go so it's kind of one of those things where like if the site was true before they're probably right again you know

486
00:43:41,488 --> 00:43:48,313
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm kind of sad Loki's not here because I swear to God, if you go back in the archives and listen to a show in January, I told him,

487
00:44:07,515 --> 00:44:14,781
[SPEAKER_06]: I said, Nintendo's going to announce a new console at E3 this year And he's like, no they're not, the Wii's still printing money I said, what do they have coming out on the Wii?

488
00:44:15,062 --> 00:44:25,310
[SPEAKER_06]: There is no big title on the Wii right now Except Zelda, that is it And now they've pushed Zelda back What's the real reason Zelda just got pushed back everybody?

489
00:44:25,971 --> 00:44:30,074
[SPEAKER_06]: That game was ready to roll, I'll bet you anything But now it's been pushed back, why?

490
00:44:30,795 --> 00:44:33,057
[SPEAKER_06]: It's getting the same treatment that the last Zelda game did

491
00:44:34,474 --> 00:44:35,075
[SPEAKER_06]: Guarantee it.

492
00:44:37,438 --> 00:44:40,323
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be multi-console just like the last one.

493
00:44:40,523 --> 00:44:44,068
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I wanted him to be here so bad so I could point out, I told you so, I told you so.

494
00:44:44,889 --> 00:44:49,155
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, honestly, I kind of see this as kind of a duh.

495
00:44:49,836 --> 00:44:53,918
[SPEAKER_06]: What else did Nintendo have to talk about at E3 this year as far as consoles go?

496
00:44:54,019 --> 00:44:57,040
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I should say living room consoles go.

497
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:07,867
[SPEAKER_06]: The 3DS, obviously, is going to be the... Clearly, they're going to roll out the Mario game and the Kid Icarus game, and those are going to be their big titles that are going to sell more this year as they talk about Netflix and some of the other multimedia.

498
00:45:07,907 --> 00:45:09,127
[SPEAKER_06]: Guaranteed, you're going to see that.

499
00:45:09,788 --> 00:45:16,091
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever way we can make nine-year-olds want to have a 3DS, they're going to try to sell as many of those under the Christmas tree as they can.

500
00:45:16,131 --> 00:45:16,892
[SPEAKER_06]: More Pokemans.

501
00:45:17,612 --> 00:45:21,753
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and rumor is there's going to be a Pokemon announcement at some point as well.

502
00:45:21,853 --> 00:45:27,335
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would peg that a little closer to Tokyo Game Show, but sure, that's inevitable as well.

503
00:45:27,355 --> 00:45:28,775
[SPEAKER_09]: Pokemon Plaid and Polka Dot.

504
00:45:29,935 --> 00:45:30,876
[SPEAKER_06]: Pokemon 3D!

505
00:45:32,996 --> 00:45:37,017
[SPEAKER_06]: But as far as living room consoles go, it's been dead on Nintendo's front.

506
00:45:37,057 --> 00:45:38,658
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, even with the Zelda game...

507
00:45:39,418 --> 00:45:49,931
[SPEAKER_06]: If that game was really coming out soon, we would be flooded with more screenshots and videos and things of that nature.

508
00:45:50,051 --> 00:45:52,434
[SPEAKER_06]: So guarantee it, there's a new console in the works.

509
00:45:52,654 --> 00:45:55,858
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo has to play catch-up in some regards to this.

510
00:45:56,098 --> 00:45:56,719
[SPEAKER_06]: It prints money.

511
00:45:57,319 --> 00:45:58,981
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there's even more rumors that...

512
00:46:01,578 --> 00:46:09,162
[SPEAKER_06]: There's even more rumors that follow up with this, and some of it has to do with the controller, I suppose, that's going to be with this system.

513
00:46:09,982 --> 00:46:18,407
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently, by the way, they're calling this whole thing Project Cafe, which I guess is like Dolphin was for the GameCube, right?

514
00:46:18,467 --> 00:46:19,287
[SPEAKER_06]: Or was that the 64?

515
00:46:19,727 --> 00:46:21,848
[SPEAKER_06]: And then Revolution was the codename for Wii.

516
00:46:21,888 --> 00:46:23,589
[SPEAKER_09]: The Saturn was the Katana, I think.

517
00:46:24,170 --> 00:46:26,871
[SPEAKER_06]: This will not be called Project Cafe when it comes out, guaranteed.

518
00:46:27,992 --> 00:46:32,195
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Saturn was Katana, but then when they were doing pre for Dreamcast, it was Neptune.

519
00:46:32,895 --> 00:46:33,296
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

520
00:46:33,676 --> 00:46:41,041
[SPEAKER_06]: They will do some very weird name that is very one-syllable type of easy thing, just like, you know, Wii was.

521
00:46:41,061 --> 00:46:42,121
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll do something like that.

522
00:46:42,542 --> 00:46:46,805
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, supposedly the controller is supposed to be like an iPad with buttons.

523
00:46:47,385 --> 00:46:51,768
[SPEAKER_06]: Eight buttons, two analog sticks, a camera, a 6.2-inch touchscreen.

524
00:46:52,208 --> 00:46:57,752
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of weird because that means the controllers themselves would cost several hundred dollars.

525
00:46:58,632 --> 00:47:00,653
[SPEAKER_06]: if they're as fancy as everyone thinks they are.

526
00:47:00,733 --> 00:47:07,155
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, see, part of me says I don't necessarily think they're as good as an iPad or an iPod because you know what I think about?

527
00:47:07,255 --> 00:47:16,619
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen these printers for sale at Fry's that have a removable touchscreen type of thing that you can take from the printer and actually look at the devices and the screen.

528
00:47:16,759 --> 00:47:18,559
[SPEAKER_06]: It's okay, but it's kind of cheap.

529
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:25,242
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that is more what this is going to look like if this is even true because the problem with this is that now that you have...

530
00:47:25,842 --> 00:47:30,265
[SPEAKER_06]: These rumors that look like they're going to be true, everybody's sucking on to it.

531
00:47:30,646 --> 00:47:36,310
[SPEAKER_06]: And now you're going to see fake pictures, fake, everybody's going to just have a field day with this.

532
00:47:36,550 --> 00:47:38,051
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just thinking of the VMU now.

533
00:47:38,996 --> 00:47:39,196
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

534
00:47:39,617 --> 00:47:41,958
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's what a lot of people are saying, too.

535
00:47:42,339 --> 00:47:43,159
[SPEAKER_02]: That would make sense.

536
00:47:43,319 --> 00:47:46,282
[SPEAKER_02]: And I honestly, I played little things on my VMU.

537
00:47:47,122 --> 00:47:51,506
[SPEAKER_02]: I was trying to raise my chao in Japanese.

538
00:47:52,527 --> 00:47:54,628
[SPEAKER_09]: And the Final Fantasy... Oh, wait, no.

539
00:47:56,030 --> 00:47:57,491
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the Pocket Station, too.

540
00:47:58,151 --> 00:48:00,613
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I totally just switched up platforms there.

541
00:48:00,633 --> 00:48:03,636
[SPEAKER_02]: That had that really cool thing, integration with the second Rival Schools.

542
00:48:04,096 --> 00:48:04,276
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

543
00:48:04,817 --> 00:48:05,857
[SPEAKER_02]: The Evolution Disc.

544
00:48:06,478 --> 00:48:06,658
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

545
00:48:07,768 --> 00:48:23,031
[SPEAKER_09]: and also Nintendo has kind of ever since the GameCube they've been the more affordable family friendly option so they can't go all high tech and put out you know a $600 system because that's going to go against what their business model has been for like 7 years now

546
00:48:23,391 --> 00:48:23,851
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree.

547
00:48:23,931 --> 00:48:26,113
[SPEAKER_06]: This has to be a cheap system.

548
00:48:26,733 --> 00:48:32,096
[SPEAKER_06]: They could probably get away with selling it for $300, maybe $400 if it's that fucking good.

549
00:48:32,557 --> 00:48:35,038
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's going to have to be cheaper than an iPad.

550
00:48:35,358 --> 00:48:36,959
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, how much was the Wii when it first came out?

551
00:48:37,279 --> 00:48:36,959
$250.

552
00:48:37,319 --> 00:48:38,780
[SPEAKER_06]: But of course, it was supposed to be the budget system.

553
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:39,761
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was a steal, yeah.

554
00:48:41,101 --> 00:49:01,608
[SPEAKER_06]: I honestly don't see them putting out such an expensive piece of technology as a controller I truly think if this is even true I really think you're looking at something like those printers and the portable because those printers are only like $300 and they have that little device you take right off of them so I think we're looking at something more like that they're all going to have Game Boy Micros attached to them

555
00:49:03,018 --> 00:49:07,322
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, whatever will help them sell more virtual console games.

556
00:49:07,742 --> 00:49:12,026
[SPEAKER_06]: I would think your 3DS would be the ideal controller for this system.

557
00:49:13,197 --> 00:49:15,519
[SPEAKER_06]: If they really want to have that synergy.

558
00:49:16,039 --> 00:49:18,261
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, remember back in the day.

559
00:49:19,362 --> 00:49:22,645
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember the Advance had the link cable to the GameCube?

560
00:49:22,905 --> 00:49:25,087
[SPEAKER_02]: We needed it for Animal Crossing to do the island.

561
00:49:25,307 --> 00:49:27,769
[SPEAKER_06]: And sadly, there were three games that used it.

562
00:49:28,109 --> 00:49:28,809
[SPEAKER_06]: Animal Crossing.

563
00:49:28,890 --> 00:49:29,330
[SPEAKER_06]: Pac-Man.

564
00:49:29,690 --> 00:49:30,651
[SPEAKER_06]: The Pac-Man Versus.

565
00:49:30,971 --> 00:49:31,812
[SPEAKER_06]: And Zelda.

566
00:49:31,912 --> 00:49:34,854
[SPEAKER_06]: Sonic Adventure 2 and the Sonic Advance game.

567
00:49:34,934 --> 00:49:35,835
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I forgot about the Sonic games.

568
00:49:35,855 --> 00:49:36,816
[SPEAKER_06]: Did the Chao trading.

569
00:49:36,836 --> 00:49:36,916
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

570
00:49:37,537 --> 00:49:49,129
[SPEAKER_06]: and then you can do weird things like unlock original Metroid but I don't consider that a full feature that's just, you know quick tangent about the Wii real quick it's hooked up now at your place for the first time in like 16 months

571
00:49:49,986 --> 00:49:50,406
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I did.

572
00:49:50,446 --> 00:49:52,408
[SPEAKER_06]: I hooked up the Wii for the first time in 16 months.

573
00:49:52,448 --> 00:49:53,408
[SPEAKER_06]: And what did I play on it?

574
00:49:54,189 --> 00:49:55,049
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Super Metroid.

575
00:49:55,149 --> 00:49:56,290
[SPEAKER_06]: We also hooked up the Super Nintendo.

576
00:49:56,310 --> 00:49:58,272
[SPEAKER_06]: I found my bonafide Super Nintendo.

577
00:49:58,532 --> 00:50:01,614
[SPEAKER_06]: We were playing Mortal Kombat, like the real Mortal Kombat.

578
00:50:01,634 --> 00:50:02,955
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was kind of cool.

579
00:50:04,115 --> 00:50:06,117
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm a little distracted right now.

580
00:50:06,157 --> 00:50:10,640
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to call this breaking news or whatever, but I just have to throw this out here because I know DarkSakura is going to be interested in this.

581
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:16,564
[SPEAKER_06]: And Miglatov, if you're listening, which I know you are, you need to post this link in chat because he's showing me graphics from Phantasy Star Online 2.

582
00:50:16,984 --> 00:50:19,866
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, my friend Krista posted those images today.

583
00:50:20,066 --> 00:50:21,526
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess more information came out on this.

584
00:50:21,687 --> 00:50:23,707
[SPEAKER_06]: I have not seen this at all.

585
00:50:23,727 --> 00:50:25,488
[SPEAKER_02]: Technically, she posted them yesterday from Japan.

586
00:50:25,808 --> 00:50:27,988
[SPEAKER_06]: There's more information on 4gamer.net.

587
00:50:28,568 --> 00:50:36,351
[SPEAKER_06]: This looks like Universe, kind of, but in high def and these cool little screens.

588
00:50:36,491 --> 00:50:39,311
[SPEAKER_02]: I miss Phantasy Star Online.

589
00:50:39,872 --> 00:50:44,353
[SPEAKER_06]: I do, too, and there was just something missing in Phantasy Star Universe, so I hope Sega's figured it out.

590
00:50:46,872 --> 00:50:47,452
[SPEAKER_06]: Who am I kidding?

591
00:50:47,472 --> 00:50:48,753
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to get that game when it comes out.

592
00:50:48,793 --> 00:50:49,574
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not even going to lie.

593
00:50:51,475 --> 00:50:52,695
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Ziba reminded me.

594
00:50:52,755 --> 00:50:55,777
[SPEAKER_06]: Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles 2 for the Game Boy Advance as a controller.

595
00:50:55,797 --> 00:50:56,277
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

596
00:50:56,818 --> 00:50:57,738
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess there were a few.

597
00:50:58,298 --> 00:50:59,539
[SPEAKER_06]: Not just one or two games.

598
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:03,701
[SPEAKER_06]: And Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles was a pretty cool game, too.

599
00:51:04,342 --> 00:51:10,565
[SPEAKER_06]: Those were all games that very few people ever really got to experience because the setup for it was so damn expensive.

600
00:51:11,025 --> 00:51:12,886
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, the Crystal Chronicles thing was so cool.

601
00:51:13,727 --> 00:51:14,968
[SPEAKER_06]: So, all right.

602
00:51:16,288 --> 00:51:19,030
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, one other rumor about the new Nintendo system.

603
00:51:19,110 --> 00:51:25,894
[SPEAKER_06]: Supposedly, Nintendo is trying to make nice nice with Rockstar, trying to get them to develop for the Wii 2.

604
00:51:27,175 --> 00:51:33,739
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is a report from, what is this, Zero One Net, which I think is also GoNintendo.

605
00:51:33,799 --> 00:51:35,320
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, it's all over the internet somewhere.

606
00:51:36,081 --> 00:51:51,802
[SPEAKER_06]: saying that Rockstar apparently is being courted for Grand Theft Auto 5 to release in 2012 2012 is supposed to be when Grand Theft Auto 5 comes out and Nintendo is supposedly courting them to release the game on this new Nintendo system as well

607
00:51:52,162 --> 00:51:53,522
[SPEAKER_06]: Which really, it makes sense.

608
00:51:53,962 --> 00:51:56,103
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's not like Rockstar hates Nintendo.

609
00:51:56,463 --> 00:51:59,444
[SPEAKER_06]: Rockstar put out that mediocre Grand Theft Auto game on the DS.

610
00:51:59,924 --> 00:52:01,524
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember the Chinatown Wars or whatever?

611
00:52:01,864 --> 00:52:05,425
[SPEAKER_06]: So it would not be unheard of for Rockstar to develop for the Nintendo console.

612
00:52:05,765 --> 00:52:12,327
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think if Nintendo wanted to be serious about the whole, hey, we're going back for the hardcore gamer this year...

613
00:52:13,207 --> 00:52:33,409
[SPEAKER_06]: and you know maybe that'll be Reggie's angle when he takes E3 stage we've made a gaming console for everybody we've made a gaming console for those that want to play their Wii games on HD we've made a gaming console for kids we've made a gaming console for the hardcore gamer you want proof we're getting Grand Theft Auto 5 bet you never thought you'd hear me saying that you know that's not gonna happen

614
00:52:33,894 --> 00:52:48,659
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, he won't say it like that, but, oh, I think Grand Theft Auto V, if the rumors are true about that this is as easy to develop for us, the Xbox 360 and so forth, or they have that synergy because of the hardware that both systems are using, I think this is absolutely true.

615
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:54,101
[SPEAKER_06]: But, I think this is also part of fanboy wank.

616
00:52:54,862 --> 00:52:56,082
[SPEAKER_06]: It kind of blurs the line.

617
00:52:56,122 --> 00:52:58,243
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's obvious fanboy wank.

618
00:52:58,743 --> 00:53:02,469
[SPEAKER_06]: You know how sometimes sites will report on things that are kind of obvious?

619
00:53:03,170 --> 00:53:05,594
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this falls in that category, to be honest.

620
00:53:06,679 --> 00:53:24,210
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I kind of wish that more companies would do because it's one of the things that made the Dreamcast easy to develop on is the fact that it would build in a Windows CE environment and every time a Dreamcast game would load that was built in Windows CE it installed the newest version of Windows CE and then played the game.

621
00:53:24,870 --> 00:53:30,534
[SPEAKER_02]: So you always had your system OS tailored to the game that you were playing.

622
00:53:31,755 --> 00:53:35,897
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, again, going to our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com is where you want to be.

623
00:53:35,997 --> 00:53:39,718
[SPEAKER_06]: Or you visit our website at www.orangeloungeradio.com and click on chat.

624
00:53:40,298 --> 00:53:44,600
[SPEAKER_06]: We're on the Game Surge Network on channel Orange Lounge is where you want to be.

625
00:53:44,660 --> 00:53:45,601
[SPEAKER_06]: That's our official chat room.

626
00:53:46,981 --> 00:53:52,703
[SPEAKER_06]: Some comments there saying, Ksan in our chat room says, Chinatown Wars was not mediocre from what I've heard.

627
00:53:52,904 --> 00:53:54,904
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just going off Loki, who's like the biggest scram.

628
00:53:54,924 --> 00:53:55,845
[SPEAKER_06]: That's Auto Addict, I know.

629
00:53:55,905 --> 00:53:56,145
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

630
00:53:57,385 --> 00:54:10,491
[SPEAKER_06]: DDR Dollar Bill says Chinatown Wars was just too dark to play and Randy in our chatroom says Nico Bellic in next Super Smash Brothers now that that could be an interesting set of talks

631
00:54:12,245 --> 00:54:40,779
[SPEAKER_06]: you know what going with the fanboy wank and this whole thing you know obviously the Zelda game will be one of the games that has a hybrid thing going on with the next console but if they really want me to just lose my shit on whatever this new console is how about that new F-Zero game already huh now that you're gonna be all high def and stuff give me a new F-Zero game why not no seriously the original F-Zero was a launch title for Super Nintendo so it's not unheard of that F-Zero could be a launch title oh yeah

632
00:54:42,097 --> 00:54:44,761
[SPEAKER_06]: F-Zero and Pilotwings in Mario World were the original launch titles.

633
00:54:46,624 --> 00:54:48,326
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember because I wanted them all.

634
00:54:50,690 --> 00:54:51,171
[SPEAKER_06]: So there you go.

635
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:54,401
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, how about something else that was on the SNES?

636
00:54:54,601 --> 00:54:54,981
[SPEAKER_02]: How about it?

637
00:54:55,661 --> 00:55:07,125
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've already mentioned Final Fantasy, but Final Fantasy VI, which was released in the US initially as Final Fantasy III, it is coming out on Virtual Console and PlayStation Network.

638
00:55:08,425 --> 00:55:11,746
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is going to be there available to play.

639
00:55:12,786 --> 00:55:16,307
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't, however, see a date attached to this.

640
00:55:17,568 --> 00:55:21,689
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, I am trying to see if there's a date on the article, and it does not

641
00:55:21,969 --> 00:55:24,030
[SPEAKER_06]: The release date is soon.

642
00:55:24,270 --> 00:55:25,030
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's soon.

643
00:55:25,550 --> 00:55:35,934
[SPEAKER_02]: But it is also going to have the full motion video that came with the PlayStation updates with the Chronicles.

644
00:55:36,114 --> 00:55:39,836
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, it's like the opera scene and the Kefkas Tower and a few others.

645
00:55:40,416 --> 00:55:42,417
[SPEAKER_09]: Hopefully it won't have the shitty loading times.

646
00:55:42,904 --> 00:55:49,290
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if it's going to be playing on PlayStation Network, it's probably going to be something you're downloading, so you won't have to worry about that.

647
00:55:49,811 --> 00:55:52,593
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's all off the hard drive, then the load time should be minimal.

648
00:55:52,633 --> 00:55:53,834
[SPEAKER_06]: Depending on the emulator.

649
00:55:53,894 --> 00:55:54,275
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

650
00:55:54,335 --> 00:55:55,636
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how that all fits in.

651
00:55:56,377 --> 00:55:57,898
[SPEAKER_02]: We've also put Flickr in here.

652
00:55:58,599 --> 00:55:58,819
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

653
00:55:59,259 --> 00:56:03,423
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I've already got 50 million copies of this plus the original, so...

654
00:56:04,758 --> 00:56:11,521
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I've got a ROM, the cart, and then the GBA port.

655
00:56:11,741 --> 00:56:13,602
[SPEAKER_06]: I will probably still buy it.

656
00:56:13,742 --> 00:56:15,943
[SPEAKER_06]: I will still buy it because I'm a consumer whore.

657
00:56:16,223 --> 00:56:16,584
[SPEAKER_06]: And how?

658
00:56:16,744 --> 00:56:21,006
[SPEAKER_06]: And Final Fantasy VI is so fucking good.

659
00:56:21,146 --> 00:56:25,128
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so good.

660
00:56:26,248 --> 00:56:29,129
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the game when I was 17, 18 years old.

661
00:56:30,785 --> 00:56:34,766
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I told you about how I stayed home from school for a week to play it.

662
00:56:36,387 --> 00:56:37,527
[SPEAKER_02]: By telling everyone I had the flu.

663
00:56:38,667 --> 00:56:45,129
[SPEAKER_06]: Final Fantasy VII, people hate on Final Fantasy VII because it's not more Final Fantasy VI.

664
00:56:45,789 --> 00:56:46,450
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's be honest.

665
00:56:46,690 --> 00:56:50,351
[SPEAKER_06]: People didn't like the 3D thing, and people didn't like the whole Neo thing.

666
00:56:50,371 --> 00:56:51,291
[SPEAKER_06]: VII was a great game.

667
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:54,732
[SPEAKER_06]: VII was a great game, it was, but people hate on it because it wasn't more of VI.

668
00:56:55,012 --> 00:57:09,433
[SPEAKER_09]: and it was 7 was rushed by Sony so it wasn't really even done but yeah I really wish that 5 and 6 got the DS 3D treatment that 3 and 4 did because those remakes were so good but I guess on the 3DS the same thing could happen

669
00:57:10,023 --> 00:57:11,923
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, oh yeah, absolutely.

670
00:57:12,363 --> 00:57:21,365
[SPEAKER_06]: Going to our chatroom at chat.orangelunchradio.com, lots of people perking up at the idea of F-Zero on the new Nintendo console being possible launch title.

671
00:57:21,645 --> 00:57:24,466
[SPEAKER_06]: BlackWolf says, F-Zero, yes, I agree with F-Zero.

672
00:57:24,526 --> 00:57:26,206
[SPEAKER_06]: Me likey F-Zero, me likey F-Zero.

673
00:57:26,726 --> 00:57:29,807
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh no, I'm sorry, me likey F-Zero was from Flaming Toilet in our chatroom.

674
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:35,248
[SPEAKER_06]: BlackWolf continued up saying, F-Zero GX equals most beautiful GameCube game.

675
00:57:35,388 --> 00:57:35,988
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.

676
00:57:36,488 --> 00:58:00,815
[SPEAKER_06]: I will tell you you could put that game in the Wii and you would not even be able to tell it's a game from last gen F-Zero GX is so good it's like my favorite racing game I think almost ever um let's see uh Kaijudo not much of a fan of F-Zero people love that F-Zero I never liked it it was too fast for me my friend tried to top trade it off to me and I hate it

677
00:58:01,055 --> 00:58:01,475
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

678
00:58:27,221 --> 00:58:32,605
[SPEAKER_06]: Ranma in our chatroom says, people hate On7 because it's the most popular, whored out, and overplayed in the fandoms.

679
00:58:33,125 --> 00:58:34,586
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

680
00:58:35,747 --> 00:58:36,467
[SPEAKER_06]: That's part of it too.

681
00:58:37,068 --> 00:58:38,569
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, moving on with some more gaming news.

682
00:58:40,256 --> 00:58:41,577
[SPEAKER_06]: Salacious Pop, what do you got for us?

683
00:58:42,557 --> 00:59:09,393
[SPEAKER_09]: Microsoft has registered a patent for networked and personalized Kinect profiles so that people can get the Kinect to remember their own unique mannerisms and how to interact with the device and also that profile would follow you if you ever went to a different Xbox and imported your it would be attached to your gamer tag is what I'm trying to say

684
00:59:09,993 --> 00:59:20,639
[SPEAKER_09]: and you can also use it to communicate possibly to other XBLA users that may not speak English or be able to communicate verbally so they might get some

685
00:59:22,793 --> 00:59:24,595
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, like sign language stuff in there.

686
00:59:25,116 --> 00:59:26,958
[SPEAKER_09]: Like a universal sign language type of thing?

687
00:59:26,978 --> 00:59:28,400
[SPEAKER_09]: That's kind of weird.

688
00:59:28,580 --> 00:59:38,132
[SPEAKER_09]: When I was trying to use the Kinect, you know, you lift your hand up and you move it over the tile that you want and you have to hold it there and you wait for the ring to spin around the hand icon.

689
00:59:38,633 --> 00:59:40,676
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanted to, like, punch it.

690
00:59:41,176 --> 00:59:45,438
[SPEAKER_09]: I would move my hand to the tile I wanted and I would go like this and then you were like, no, just hold your hand still.

691
00:59:46,299 --> 00:59:54,602
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think if I could go and say, I don't like how the Kinect wants me to do this particular command.

692
00:59:54,682 --> 00:59:58,264
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's how I want to do it and have it save that and follow my profile around.

693
00:59:58,304 --> 01:00:00,305
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's what this patent is for.

694
01:00:01,045 --> 01:00:01,746
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be really cool.

695
01:00:01,926 --> 01:00:02,286
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

696
01:00:02,586 --> 01:00:05,407
[SPEAKER_06]: But then they throw in this whole, like, phones and computers into it.

697
01:00:05,467 --> 01:00:07,408
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm like, what, the phones are going to have Kinect in them?

698
01:00:07,628 --> 01:00:08,509
[SPEAKER_06]: I hardly think so.

699
01:00:09,029 --> 01:00:11,090
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe the profile comes in somehow.

700
01:00:11,330 --> 01:00:16,713
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I guess Kinect isn't just about the motions, but voice as well.

701
01:00:17,173 --> 01:00:20,294
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe the voice will activate your profile on the phone?

702
01:00:21,035 --> 01:00:22,075
[SPEAKER_06]: Seems a little strange.

703
01:00:22,235 --> 01:00:22,395
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

704
01:00:25,009 --> 01:00:26,690
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, well, I guess we'll see what comes of that.

705
01:00:26,730 --> 01:00:29,711
[SPEAKER_06]: That could be something that Microsoft's planning on unveiling at E3.

706
01:00:29,771 --> 01:00:30,111
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

707
01:00:31,052 --> 01:00:38,355
[SPEAKER_06]: Something else we might find out more on very soon is what is to come of this online survey that EA is doing.

708
01:00:38,475 --> 01:00:43,938
[SPEAKER_06]: As you know, surveys are a popular breeding ground for rumors, and this time it's about EA Sports.

709
01:00:44,258 --> 01:00:56,162
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently EA Sports is investigating the reception to a paid subscription that would deliver paid downloadable content for free and make some full versions of upcoming games available to download before the release date.

710
01:00:56,562 --> 01:01:01,763
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's like you could join the club and then you get to break the embargo on games or something.

711
01:01:02,203 --> 01:01:05,724
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of sounds a little bit like PlayStation Plus, but unique to EA or something.

712
01:01:05,764 --> 01:01:06,065
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

713
01:01:07,725 --> 01:01:26,574
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of the bullet points that were mentioned in the survey Discounts on all downloadable content for participating EA Sports console based titles Let's see, yeah, so that's the kind of stuff they're talking about asking Also, of course, you can get the game on PlayStation Network or Xbox Live before it even comes out

714
01:01:27,314 --> 01:01:48,726
[SPEAKER_06]: that could be indicative of digital distribution and kind of moving more towards that mechanism so you would be able to bypass the store and buy the game from EA directly so they could keep all the profits that apparently is the intent here but you have to pay to join the club to do that you get to pay to join this club so you can pay EA directly and get the game early

715
01:01:51,181 --> 01:01:52,843
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I'm reading out of this, right?

716
01:01:52,863 --> 01:01:53,905
[SPEAKER_02]: Bribe us and you'll get it.

717
01:01:54,546 --> 01:01:55,527
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of what it is.

718
01:01:57,771 --> 01:01:58,151
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

719
01:01:58,572 --> 01:02:05,923
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, one other thing that they're talking about, the ability to transfer paid content from your current participating titles to future title versions.

720
01:02:06,824 --> 01:02:22,821
[SPEAKER_06]: so like if you buy like $50 worth of extra golf courses in Tiger Woods 12 you would get to transport them to future games which a lot of other game series are already doing for free like DJ Hero did that right you had the downloadable thing that would unlock anyway

721
01:02:25,223 --> 01:02:28,086
[SPEAKER_09]: Launch Day DLC, the ability to turn left, five bucks.

722
01:02:28,446 --> 01:02:31,149
[SPEAKER_09]: Launch Day DLC, the ability to turn right, five bucks.

723
01:02:32,190 --> 01:02:33,351
[SPEAKER_09]: That's where I'm worried we're headed.

724
01:02:33,371 --> 01:02:35,273
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's a racing game, so you only need to go forward.

725
01:02:35,693 --> 01:02:37,394
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't have to get left and right if you don't want to.

726
01:02:37,535 --> 01:02:42,439
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the one thing that excites me about what's going on with Sony right now, which I know sounds really messed up.

727
01:02:42,459 --> 01:02:50,947
[SPEAKER_06]: But if it does come out that your personal data was put at risk, digital distribution just got set back four years, guaranteed, if that comes out.

728
01:02:52,399 --> 01:02:53,121
[SPEAKER_09]: On the console level, yes.

729
01:02:53,161 --> 01:02:53,401
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

730
01:03:03,047 --> 01:03:03,447
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

731
01:03:03,948 --> 01:03:04,388
[SPEAKER_06]: Steam?

732
01:03:04,608 --> 01:03:10,851
[SPEAKER_09]: Steam is really just a store where PSN and XBLA is more of an integrated matching process.

733
01:03:10,871 --> 01:03:13,673
[SPEAKER_06]: There's still stores, but they're stores that are built into your console.

734
01:03:13,713 --> 01:03:14,854
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a little different.

735
01:03:14,874 --> 01:03:17,915
[SPEAKER_06]: Whereas the PC isn't so much a console.

736
01:03:18,256 --> 01:03:20,337
[SPEAKER_06]: You have the freedom to do whatever you want on the PC.

737
01:03:20,357 --> 01:03:22,418
[SPEAKER_09]: There are alternatives to Steam for the PC.

738
01:03:22,478 --> 01:03:26,901
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the same platform.

739
01:03:26,961 --> 01:03:30,623
[SPEAKER_06]: We will see what comes of this possible paid subscription in the future.

740
01:03:30,783 --> 01:03:31,123
[SPEAKER_06]: Moving on.

741
01:03:31,687 --> 01:03:34,649
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, since we were on Steam and this is how I bought the game.

742
01:03:36,410 --> 01:03:42,555
[SPEAKER_02]: Super Meat Boy Ultra Edition will be coming out in the UK sometime between July and September this year.

743
01:03:43,496 --> 01:03:54,424
[SPEAKER_02]: It will be published by Lace Mamba Global and it's going to be an actual boxed edition that is going to be coming out.

744
01:03:54,564 --> 01:03:58,687
[SPEAKER_02]: So it will have a 40 page booklet that has never before seen art.

745
01:03:59,287 --> 01:04:07,892
[SPEAKER_02]: and some behind the scenes information, an extended version of Team Meat Comics and the soundtrack and additional audio and a mini poster.

746
01:04:09,053 --> 01:04:10,033
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay, a poster!

747
01:04:11,614 --> 01:04:15,596
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you also get a slab of rotted meat and a band-aid.

748
01:04:16,137 --> 01:04:16,937
[SPEAKER_06]: And you get a meat dress.

749
01:04:17,337 --> 01:04:18,058
[SPEAKER_02]: You get a meat dress.

750
01:04:18,838 --> 01:04:19,439
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, maybe not.

751
01:04:19,719 --> 01:04:19,979
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no.

752
01:04:21,879 --> 01:04:23,319
[SPEAKER_06]: Do they have that as a marketing thing?

753
01:04:23,379 --> 01:04:24,520
[SPEAKER_06]: Little bandages?

754
01:04:24,740 --> 01:04:25,620
[SPEAKER_06]: Super Meat Boy band-aids?

755
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:28,381
[SPEAKER_01]: See, that would be a good idea to have bandage girl bandages.

756
01:04:28,421 --> 01:04:29,041
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.

757
01:04:29,301 --> 01:04:29,841
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.

758
01:04:30,161 --> 01:04:32,702
[SPEAKER_01]: Copyright, Jamie, Orange Island Radio.

759
01:04:32,762 --> 01:04:33,902
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, wait, except it's not your game.

760
01:04:33,942 --> 01:04:34,642
[SPEAKER_01]: Pay, pay, pay.

761
01:04:34,762 --> 01:04:35,103
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

762
01:04:36,743 --> 01:04:41,804
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, let's move on and travel the world with some release dates and see what games are coming out to a store near you.

763
01:04:41,924 --> 01:04:44,625
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be hard to top last week, but we'll see what happens.

764
01:04:44,925 --> 01:04:48,466
[SPEAKER_06]: Salacious Pop, why don't you start us off with what is coming out this week in America?

765
01:04:49,515 --> 01:04:58,363
[SPEAKER_09]: Since we didn't have a show last week, there are a few other titles aside from MK and Portal that came out.

766
01:04:58,763 --> 01:05:02,407
[SPEAKER_09]: Socom 4 was another big one for last week.

767
01:05:02,447 --> 01:05:03,808
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody gets to play it right now.

768
01:05:03,868 --> 01:05:05,069
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, totally.

769
01:05:05,429 --> 01:05:08,792
[SPEAKER_09]: And then Final Fantasy 4, the complete collection on PSP.

770
01:05:09,513 --> 01:05:10,494
[SPEAKER_09]: Huge week for games.

771
01:05:10,814 --> 01:05:11,194
[SPEAKER_06]: Huge.

772
01:05:12,135 --> 01:05:13,836
[SPEAKER_09]: This week, upcoming is...

773
01:05:15,785 --> 01:05:23,327
[SPEAKER_09]: Pretty sparse, considering people's wallets can't really take more gonzo weeks of game releases like last week.

774
01:05:23,367 --> 01:05:24,427
[SPEAKER_09]: So this one's pretty mellow.

775
01:05:25,327 --> 01:05:40,690
[SPEAKER_09]: We have Operation Flashpoint, Red River on PS3 and 360, Haunted for PC, Operation Flashpoint, okay, Red River again on PC, Darkspore on PC, and...

776
01:05:44,301 --> 01:05:52,688
[SPEAKER_09]: IL2, I cannot even pronounce this, Sturmavik, Cliffs of Dover on PC, which sounds like a weird budget army game.

777
01:05:52,808 --> 01:05:53,609
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't even know what that is.

778
01:05:54,009 --> 01:05:54,329
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's it.

779
01:05:54,349 --> 01:05:55,150
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like six titles.

780
01:05:55,891 --> 01:06:02,656
[SPEAKER_06]: Bobby Blackwolf in our chat room is lamenting the non-mention of Conduit 2, which also came out this last week.

781
01:06:04,278 --> 01:06:04,718
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, there it is.

782
01:06:04,758 --> 01:06:04,978
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

783
01:06:05,058 --> 01:06:07,661
[SPEAKER_06]: And poor little Conduit 2 is going to get that a lot.

784
01:06:09,542 --> 01:06:11,823
[SPEAKER_06]: This was not a smart week to release that game.

785
01:06:11,863 --> 01:06:12,403
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, dudes.

786
01:06:12,703 --> 01:06:13,663
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what else to say.

787
01:06:15,204 --> 01:06:19,745
[SPEAKER_06]: I think some companies severely underestimated the power of Portal Combat.

788
01:06:19,805 --> 01:06:22,646
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, on top of SOCOM, too.

789
01:06:22,686 --> 01:06:24,086
[SPEAKER_06]: SOCOM is a huge game, too.

790
01:06:24,446 --> 01:06:27,287
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually think it was a dumb week to release Final Fantasy IV, too.

791
01:06:27,647 --> 01:06:32,808
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially considering that the PSP does a lot through digital distribution now.

792
01:06:32,868 --> 01:06:36,389
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, nobody can buy that game on the PlayStation Network right now.

793
01:06:37,990 --> 01:06:38,310
[SPEAKER_06]: Yikes.

794
01:06:39,076 --> 01:06:39,756
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

795
01:07:03,951 --> 01:07:05,651
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, now I can't even remember the name of it.

796
01:07:05,691 --> 01:07:07,492
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, it has this really unique art style.

797
01:07:07,512 --> 01:07:09,032
[SPEAKER_06]: It reminds me of an old PC game.

798
01:07:09,732 --> 01:07:10,632
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it Alone in the Dark?

799
01:07:10,672 --> 01:07:11,353
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that what it's called?

800
01:07:11,673 --> 01:07:12,293
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't remember that.

801
01:07:12,353 --> 01:07:12,713
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me see.

802
01:07:12,953 --> 01:07:14,993
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a classic game of the week she did not that long ago.

803
01:07:15,494 --> 01:07:17,934
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't know why, but the art style kind of reminds me of that a little bit.

804
01:07:18,294 --> 01:07:19,474
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's kind of an action game.

805
01:07:20,335 --> 01:07:23,355
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe in the same vein as like Bayonetta type of thing where you play a dude with a sword.

806
01:07:23,395 --> 01:07:24,035
[SPEAKER_06]: That is really pretty.

807
01:07:24,055 --> 01:07:25,236
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it is a pretty game.

808
01:07:25,256 --> 01:07:27,836
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, that's El Shaddai Ascension of the Metatron.

809
01:07:28,136 --> 01:07:29,457
[SPEAKER_06]: Comes out this week on the Xbox 360.

810
01:07:30,237 --> 01:07:31,177
[SPEAKER_02]: Very biblically themed.

811
01:07:31,557 --> 01:07:37,000
[SPEAKER_06]: Also this week on the Xbox 360 in Japan, Espegaluda 2 Black Label Platinum Collection.

812
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:38,340
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Espegaluda.

813
01:07:38,620 --> 01:07:39,561
[SPEAKER_06]: Price reduction.

814
01:07:39,761 --> 01:07:40,801
[SPEAKER_06]: That's bullet hell, right?

815
01:07:41,462 --> 01:07:41,722
[SPEAKER_06]: Or no?

816
01:07:41,822 --> 01:07:42,882
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

817
01:07:42,942 --> 01:07:45,624
[SPEAKER_06]: PlayStation 3 also gets El Shaddai this week.

818
01:07:45,744 --> 01:07:48,665
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty much the only big release over there on the PlayStation 3.

819
01:07:49,485 --> 01:07:51,646
[SPEAKER_06]: On the Nintendo Wii this week, nothing.

820
01:07:51,826 --> 01:07:54,828
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to hear that a lot when it comes to the Nintendo Wii because there's nothing coming out.

821
01:07:55,328 --> 01:07:59,351
[SPEAKER_06]: On the Nintendo 3DS, Dekasporta 3D Sports comes out.

822
01:07:59,471 --> 01:08:02,613
[SPEAKER_06]: That, of course, is Dekasports from Hudson in Japan.

823
01:08:03,654 --> 01:08:12,320
[SPEAKER_06]: Coming out on the regular DS, Hakoyuki Yugi Roku DS comes out this week on the Nintendo DS non-3D.

824
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:17,884
[SPEAKER_06]: That's an adventure game with little chibi characters that I'm sure most people don't care about because...

825
01:08:18,544 --> 01:08:19,525
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so last gen.

826
01:08:20,146 --> 01:08:26,552
[SPEAKER_06]: And then lastly, the Sony PSP has a variety of games coming out this week in Japan, including Patapon 3, which I believe came out over here as well.

827
01:08:27,113 --> 01:08:31,498
[SPEAKER_06]: Saigo no Yakusoku no Monogatari comes out as well this week.

828
01:08:31,638 --> 01:08:37,844
[SPEAKER_06]: That is from Epic, and that is a Japanese RPG on the PSP.

829
01:08:39,065 --> 01:08:41,448
[SPEAKER_06]: Looks like kind of a man versus robot type of thing.

830
01:08:42,809 --> 01:09:08,861
[SPEAKER_06]: and lastly Otome wa Onesama no I'm sorry Ni Koi Shiteru Portable 2 Jin no Elder comes out this week as well and that is one more adventure game on the PSP in Japan and this is the one that future features pretty girls and it looks like you play four pretty girls going on these quests they're like looking through telescopes and dressing up it's like the Spice Girls get their own RPG look at that

831
01:09:10,742 --> 01:09:13,264
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a few things for Europe.

832
01:09:15,025 --> 01:09:30,615
[SPEAKER_02]: On the 26th is Mythos, on the 27th there's Outland, on the 28th Darkspore, Shin Megami Tensei Persona 3 Portable, also on the 29th is Thor the video game, and Virtua Tennis 4.

833
01:09:33,156 --> 01:09:41,925
[SPEAKER_06]: yay Virtua Tennis let's move on with another story from Salacious Pot the classic game of the week is coming up in just a little bit stay tuned

834
01:09:43,288 --> 01:09:52,012
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so as of the 16th, which would have been, I guess, last weekend, the Wii console has experienced a price drop.

835
01:09:52,312 --> 01:09:56,434
[SPEAKER_09]: Best Buy got to do it first for about a day before everyone else.

836
01:09:57,114 --> 01:09:57,434
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, $170.

837
01:09:58,535 --> 01:10:05,838
[SPEAKER_09]: And then every other major retailer started selling it at that price, I think, within 48 hours later.

838
01:10:07,118 --> 01:10:09,920
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, as of the 18th, you can get a Wii kit for $170.

839
01:10:10,340 --> 01:10:17,944
[SPEAKER_09]: And also, just more recently announced, Wii Sports Resort and Wii Party, which are the two...

840
01:10:20,262 --> 01:10:22,724
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess they're bundled titles that you can also buy separately.

841
01:10:23,124 --> 01:10:27,967
[SPEAKER_09]: Also got more of the staple titles of the current Wii lineup.

842
01:10:28,147 --> 01:10:30,188
[SPEAKER_09]: If you just can't get enough, Woohoo Island.

843
01:10:30,628 --> 01:10:31,949
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

844
01:10:32,029 --> 01:10:37,753
[SPEAKER_09]: Those prices dropped $10 down to $39.99 per title starting the 25th, which is tomorrow.

845
01:10:42,936 --> 01:10:49,381
[SPEAKER_09]: So Wii Console cheaper, and the two staple games, if you didn't get them bundled, are now $10 off as well.

846
01:10:50,081 --> 01:11:04,632
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I just want to point this out, because this is something you're not really reading in the news, but, you know, Loki has ties when it comes to selling things, and he made this little note in our little thread where we always talk about what stories we're going to talk about on the show, and so I'm going to pass this little tidbit along, do with it what you will.

847
01:11:05,112 --> 01:11:09,075
[SPEAKER_06]: He says, just the top five direct Nintendo retailers...

848
01:11:09,496 --> 01:11:10,881
[SPEAKER_06]: Not all retailers.

849
01:11:11,402 --> 01:11:15,155
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a temporary price drop to clear overstock inventory.

850
01:11:16,657 --> 01:11:43,327
[SPEAKER_06]: I wonder why they'd want to move Wii's well I mean one could hypothesize that the new Nintendo console plays into this but come on that's going to be a year away although I don't know I mean part of me wants to say why would you announce a console at E3 when it's not going to come out until next year but that's exactly what they did with the 3DS so that kind of refutes that but I would think they would try to get it something out console wise this year but we'll see I don't know

851
01:11:44,248 --> 01:11:46,090
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what this price drop should be tried into.

852
01:11:46,130 --> 01:11:47,091
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe a new bundle.

853
01:11:47,171 --> 01:11:48,993
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe that's the route they're going to go.

854
01:11:49,353 --> 01:11:53,478
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe they're clearing overstock so they can do some Uber Wii bundle that's going to come out for the holidays.

855
01:11:53,958 --> 01:11:59,244
[SPEAKER_09]: In these two games, like I just said, if you buy them all a cart, you can also get a bundle with them.

856
01:11:59,744 --> 01:12:00,345
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah, true.

857
01:12:00,785 --> 01:12:02,968
[SPEAKER_09]: So they're just kind of taking up space now.

858
01:12:03,488 --> 01:12:07,193
[SPEAKER_06]: There's got to be some type of Uber Wii coming out towards the end of the year.

859
01:12:07,574 --> 01:12:09,236
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it called the Wii Wii?

860
01:12:11,319 --> 01:12:13,802
[SPEAKER_01]: None.

861
01:12:15,023 --> 01:12:18,428
[SPEAKER_06]: Something you will not be able to play on the Wii, but you'll be able to play it on the Xbox 360.

862
01:12:19,569 --> 01:12:28,736
[SPEAKER_06]: and eventually you'll be able to play it on the PlayStation 3 but news came out this week that Child of Eden from Q Entertainment has been pushed back to September on the PlayStation 3.

863
01:12:29,437 --> 01:12:33,880
[SPEAKER_06]: The game is still coming out on June 14th for the Xbox 360 with Kinect support.

864
01:12:34,321 --> 01:12:36,082
[SPEAKER_06]: So why was it pushed back to September?

865
01:12:36,542 --> 01:12:36,802
[SPEAKER_06]: Well...

866
01:12:37,603 --> 01:12:42,587
[SPEAKER_06]: They haven't really said, but they have said that it will now feature Move support for the PlayStation.

867
01:12:42,947 --> 01:12:47,591
[SPEAKER_06]: So perhaps that is the reason why it was pushed back, was to include the PlayStation Move support.

868
01:12:48,532 --> 01:12:49,813
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know why they bothered.

869
01:12:50,113 --> 01:12:57,198
[SPEAKER_06]: They should have just patched that in later, because I kind of think the PlayStation Move... Is anyone still all about PlayStation Move right now?

870
01:12:57,659 --> 01:13:00,121
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, one could argue, is anyone about Kinect right now?

871
01:13:00,441 --> 01:13:01,301
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

872
01:13:31,704 --> 01:13:34,247
[SPEAKER_06]: and visit Classic Games from Gaming's Past.

873
01:13:34,568 --> 01:13:41,315
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the Classic Game of the Week segment and DarkSakura's going to dive into the vault headfirst and find a game that she says, Hey!

874
01:13:42,417 --> 01:13:43,278
[SPEAKER_06]: You little brats!

875
01:13:43,878 --> 01:13:46,982
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a classic game you should check out right freaking now.

876
01:13:47,423 --> 01:13:48,944
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, what is the Classic Game of the Week?

877
01:13:49,873 --> 01:13:52,255
[SPEAKER_02]: The game of the week is called Narbacular Drop.

878
01:13:53,556 --> 01:13:55,178
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a game I have brought up before.

879
01:13:55,378 --> 01:13:56,439
[SPEAKER_06]: I see what you're doing here.

880
01:13:56,739 --> 01:13:57,220
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

881
01:13:57,260 --> 01:14:00,202
[SPEAKER_02]: I figured with Portal 2 coming out, it's best to get to the root.

882
01:14:00,703 --> 01:14:05,487
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's listen to some of the ambience from Narbacular Drop.

883
01:14:06,088 --> 01:14:06,288
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

884
01:14:08,770 --> 01:14:12,273
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully the... There wasn't a lot of sound in this game, I believe.

885
01:14:12,313 --> 01:14:14,175
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but it had some decent music.

886
01:14:17,079 --> 01:14:22,643
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, at any rate, Narbacular Drop is the precursor to Portal.

887
01:14:23,243 --> 01:14:33,030
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a free game online in 2005 for the PC, ran in DirectX 9, and it was the senior game project of students going to DigiPen.

888
01:14:33,950 --> 01:14:41,456
[SPEAKER_02]: They actually named it Narbacular Drop because Narbacular is not really a word, and so it would help the thing be found on search engines really easily.

889
01:14:42,476 --> 01:14:54,167
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically, the whole premise is that there was a Princess No Knees, as in No-K-N-E-E-S, who is unable to jump.

890
01:14:54,247 --> 01:15:05,317
[SPEAKER_02]: She was captured by a demon and imprisoned, so she found out that since the prison is actually a sentient creature named Wall-E and has a portal-making ability, she could escape through using portals.

891
01:15:06,278 --> 01:15:13,780
[SPEAKER_02]: So it basically, it has the whole first person shooter vibe like Quake, but it has the portals in there too.

892
01:15:13,820 --> 01:15:14,980
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to solve different puzzles.

893
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:18,161
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very, I mean, you can definitely see where this led to portal.

894
01:15:19,081 --> 01:15:21,882
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you create the different interconnected portals.

895
01:15:21,902 --> 01:15:26,363
[SPEAKER_02]: You can actually shoot portals through portals as well, which was very interesting.

896
01:15:27,323 --> 01:15:28,023
[SPEAKER_02]: It really helped.

897
01:15:28,063 --> 01:15:31,925
[SPEAKER_02]: But you'd have boxes and boulders and things to avoid.

898
01:15:31,965 --> 01:15:33,366
[SPEAKER_02]: You have different switches to do.

899
01:15:33,826 --> 01:15:36,387
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't save in the game.

900
01:15:37,267 --> 01:15:39,828
[SPEAKER_02]: And it really is very complex.

901
01:15:40,288 --> 01:15:45,591
[SPEAKER_02]: You only have about six puzzles in that because, again, this was a senior project.

902
01:15:46,531 --> 01:15:48,833
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's super good.

903
01:15:48,853 --> 01:15:50,294
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually pretty, pretty fun.

904
01:15:51,034 --> 01:16:01,742
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, basically, the group that developed it was snatched right up by Valve and said, we like this idea, make us Portal.

905
01:16:02,363 --> 01:16:06,486
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, okay, sure, we'd like to do that.

906
01:16:07,506 --> 01:16:07,666
[SPEAKER_02]: And...

907
01:16:09,628 --> 01:16:10,128
[SPEAKER_02]: So they did.

908
01:16:11,529 --> 01:16:16,132
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, it's actually, you know, you can actually go get this for free.

909
01:16:16,852 --> 01:16:17,753
[SPEAKER_02]: It is online.

910
01:16:18,373 --> 01:16:20,655
[SPEAKER_02]: It will run on just about any PC.

911
01:16:20,855 --> 01:16:23,177
[SPEAKER_02]: And it, you know, it's nothing great to look at.

912
01:16:23,257 --> 01:16:24,617
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like, you know...

913
01:16:25,958 --> 01:16:30,161
[SPEAKER_02]: and Spritely like Quake, like early Quake and Doom and Hexen.

914
01:16:30,721 --> 01:16:34,584
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, it is 3D, but it's 3D with sprite textures.

915
01:16:34,684 --> 01:16:37,286
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think something that's important to mention too, it looks nothing like Portal.

916
01:16:37,506 --> 01:16:38,326
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it looks nothing like Portal.

917
01:16:38,346 --> 01:16:39,727
[SPEAKER_06]: It does not have that test chamber look.

918
01:16:39,747 --> 01:16:41,869
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks more like a medieval castle type of look.

919
01:16:41,889 --> 01:16:46,072
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that's one very common misconception about Immaculate Drop is that it looks like Portal.

920
01:16:46,112 --> 01:16:46,632
[SPEAKER_06]: It really doesn't.

921
01:16:47,009 --> 01:16:53,011
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's set, you're a princess escaping from a dungeon, trapped by a demon, so.

922
01:16:54,852 --> 01:16:57,753
[SPEAKER_02]: The story is different, however, the premise is the same.

923
01:16:57,813 --> 01:17:06,996
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to use your portals, solve puzzles, and get out while not being, you know, jumped on by creatures, and falling in the lava, and having GLaDOS, wait, wrong game.

924
01:17:10,630 --> 01:17:11,772
[SPEAKER_02]: I've gotten our bacular drop.

925
01:17:11,812 --> 01:17:13,315
[SPEAKER_02]: I've gone a few puzzles through it.

926
01:17:13,676 --> 01:17:19,047
[SPEAKER_02]: And honestly, it's a little bit harder for me to get through because early 3D like that kinda...

927
01:17:20,635 --> 01:17:23,637
[SPEAKER_02]: It gives me a headache, if that makes sense.

928
01:17:23,717 --> 01:17:31,302
[SPEAKER_02]: I can do all the sprite-based 3D-like games just fine, but if it's actual 3D with the sprite-based textures, then it makes me kind of sick.

929
01:17:32,203 --> 01:17:34,904
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's still a fun little game.

930
01:17:34,944 --> 01:17:36,225
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's free.

931
01:17:36,325 --> 01:17:36,846
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not?

932
01:17:37,866 --> 01:17:44,390
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've got it attached to... Well, I mean, you can't download it through Steam, but I have it attached to my Steam account, so I can just launch it through that.

933
01:17:44,470 --> 01:17:47,392
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's a fun little game.

934
01:17:47,472 --> 01:17:48,093
[SPEAKER_02]: It really is.

935
01:17:48,253 --> 01:17:48,653
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just...

936
01:17:50,514 --> 01:17:51,795
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a small download.

937
01:17:52,375 --> 01:17:55,076
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really simple.

938
01:17:55,136 --> 01:17:55,996
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just simple and fun.

939
01:17:56,116 --> 01:17:56,456
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all.

940
01:17:56,576 --> 01:18:00,658
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you want to see the origins of Portal, you should definitely try Nebacular Drop.

941
01:18:00,678 --> 01:18:02,079
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

942
01:18:02,099 --> 01:18:06,160
[SPEAKER_02]: With the little horribly drawn story bits at the beginning.

943
01:18:06,380 --> 01:18:11,122
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really neat to see, too, how freaking far this game evolved, too.

944
01:18:12,142 --> 01:18:14,963
[SPEAKER_06]: You go play Nebacular Drop, it's really nothing like Portal.

945
01:18:15,003 --> 01:18:16,204
[SPEAKER_02]: This is six years ago.

946
01:18:16,664 --> 01:18:17,584
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

947
01:18:33,750 --> 01:18:41,937
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I want to say that the original way that this was done was by completely duplicating and re-rendering the room when you threw the portal.

948
01:18:42,637 --> 01:18:53,806
[SPEAKER_02]: But now, with Portal 2, it's just, not with Portal 2, but with the actual portal, they redid those physics to where it actually would just respawn you through a particular point.

949
01:18:54,167 --> 01:18:54,287
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm-hmm.

950
01:18:55,227 --> 01:19:13,752
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember there's something about this on the Portal commentary where they were talking about the difference in programming and what went into, you know, what they changed from Robacular Drop to Portal and how certain things wouldn't carry over and how certain things had to carry over.

951
01:19:14,032 --> 01:19:15,072
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's pretty neat.

952
01:19:16,513 --> 01:19:35,404
[SPEAKER_09]: And Valve is one of the few major studios that are known to do it quite often to hire employees from the community, whether it be the fandom community or to just go to the studio that made Narbacular Drop and just say, we want to buy your shop and bring you in for this project.

953
01:19:35,424 --> 01:19:35,564
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

954
01:19:36,448 --> 01:19:37,629

[SPEAKER_02]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

956
01:20:20,726 --> 01:20:22,167
[SPEAKER_06]: of such a landmark game.

957
01:20:22,567 --> 01:20:28,710
[SPEAKER_02]: I would seriously like at least five of our listeners to download it and send me an email what you think of it.

958
01:20:29,010 --> 01:20:30,551
[SPEAKER_06]: It is super free, right?

959
01:20:30,611 --> 01:20:31,051
[SPEAKER_02]: Super free.

960
01:20:31,231 --> 01:20:31,711
[SPEAKER_02]: Very free.

[SPEAKER_02]: You can download it all over the place.

962
01:20:34,233 --> 01:20:34,553
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

01:20:35,573 --> 01:20:35,973
[SPEAKER_06]: There it is.

964
01:20:36,013 --> 01:20:41,756
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's usually your classic games of the week are like obscure fucking Sega titles that will cost you $100 on eBay.

965
01:20:41,776 --> 01:20:43,157
[SPEAKER_06]: But this one is free.

966
01:20:43,297 --> 01:20:43,657
[SPEAKER_02]: It's free.

967
01:20:43,737 --> 01:20:44,157

[SPEAKER_01]: It's in Space Fantasy Zone.

969
01:20:46,498 --> 01:20:47,459
[SPEAKER_01]: You can download that online.

970
01:20:47,884 --> 01:20:49,786
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week.

971
01:20:49,806 --> 01:20:51,568
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to take a break here live, folks.

972
01:20:51,588 --> 01:20:52,989
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got plenty more show to come.

973
01:20:53,069 --> 01:20:54,651
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been a pretty busy week.

974
01:20:54,691 --> 01:20:55,912
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got to talk about Mega Man Legends 3.

975
01:20:55,972 --> 01:20:57,334
[SPEAKER_06]: There was some news on that this week.

976
01:20:58,155 --> 01:20:59,756
[SPEAKER_06]: Talk about, yet again, Guitar Hero.

977
01:21:00,016 --> 01:21:03,600
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob, before I forget, I am posting the download link in the chat room.

978
01:21:03,780 --> 01:21:09,446
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so go download it ASAP and let DarkSakura know your thoughts, especially if you haven't played before.

979
01:21:10,447 --> 01:21:11,688
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, we're going to take a quick break, guys.

980
01:21:11,708 --> 01:21:12,389
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll be back, though.

981
01:21:12,449 --> 01:21:13,851
[SPEAKER_06]: Plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio.

982
01:21:13,891 --> 01:21:15,032
[SPEAKER_06]: Lots of emails tonight, too.

983
01:21:15,132 --> 01:21:17,314
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking of wanting emails, I was looking at the email bag earlier.

984
01:21:17,695 --> 01:21:19,156
[SPEAKER_06]: It has built up over the past couple weeks.

985
01:21:19,216 --> 01:21:19,857
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay!

986
01:21:19,877 --> 01:21:21,038
[SPEAKER_06]: So we get lots of voices tonight.

987
01:21:21,559 --> 01:21:23,521
[SPEAKER_06]: And phone calls coming up before the night is over.

988
01:21:23,601 --> 01:21:28,746
[SPEAKER_06]: So stay tuned, guys, on this Easter Sunday, episode 410 of Orange Lounge Radio.

989
01:21:29,026 --> 01:21:30,268
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll be right back after this.

990
01:21:36,482 --> 01:21:37,263
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakra, what do you do?

991
01:21:37,303 --> 01:21:38,263
[SPEAKER_06]: You have another little show.

992
01:22:05,202 --> 01:22:05,822
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

993
01:22:34,460 --> 01:22:34,800
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

994
01:22:35,661 --> 01:22:37,042
[SPEAKER_06]: But not always on.

995
01:22:39,164 --> 01:22:40,545
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a hectic month, you know.

996
01:22:40,665 --> 01:22:42,867
[SPEAKER_02]: And besides that, now next month, finals.

997
01:22:43,607 --> 01:22:43,927
[SPEAKER_02]: Yikes.

998
01:22:45,228 --> 01:22:52,774
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we're still doing the side project I've got going on with Extifer, the best little horde house in Azeroth, also known as Horde House for short.

999
01:22:53,115 --> 01:23:01,181
[SPEAKER_06]: If you like World of Warcraft, or even if you hate it, but you just enjoy Extifer talking about his wang, you can download us at hordehouse.com.

1000
01:23:01,221 --> 01:23:02,402
[SPEAKER_06]: We actually have a website and everything.

1001
01:23:02,902 --> 01:23:26,440
[SPEAKER_06]: and uh yeah we were off last week inadvertently we had Comcast go down 30 minutes into the show uh so we had like a jumbo episode this week so there's like two hours of wow talk this week that's a lot of wow it's definitely a lot of wow all right let's get into some rapid fire news some quick news stories uh that we wanted to bring up at some point on tonight's show Loki's gonna start us off oh wait he's not here slash Bob's gonna start us off

1002
01:23:27,697 --> 01:23:28,118
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

1003
01:23:28,238 --> 01:23:32,062
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, when you sit in the chair and... Yeah.

1004
01:23:32,082 --> 01:23:33,924
[SPEAKER_06]: Pop's going to start us off because Loki has the night off.

1005
01:23:34,966 --> 01:23:39,771
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so here's a feel-good human interest story that's going to make you go, aww.

1006
01:23:39,811 --> 01:23:40,252
[SPEAKER_09]: Skip it.

1007
01:23:42,507 --> 01:24:03,145
[SPEAKER_09]: A gamer who goes by the name of Ben, I don't know if that's his handle or his real name, started dating a nice young lady and eventually at some point during the relationship when they were hitting it off, he gave her the gamer talk, you know, if we don't have plans, I'm going to be parked in front of the TV for hours playing my games and you need to be okay with that.

1008
01:24:03,766 --> 01:24:07,109
[SPEAKER_09]: And her response was, you play Borderlands, right?

1009
01:24:07,169 --> 01:24:07,669
[SPEAKER_09]: Fire it up.

1010
01:24:07,990 --> 01:24:08,870
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah.

1011
01:24:08,890 --> 01:24:08,971
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1012
01:24:09,691 --> 01:24:38,614
[SPEAKER_09]: so the two of them played all through Borderlands and all of the DLC and I guess Ben went to Gearbox and told them this lovely story of gamer romance and said that he was going to propose to her and Gearbox made a video called Borderlands Modest Proposal which you can find on YouTube where they have their sassy rude profanity dropping mascot

1013
01:24:39,515 --> 01:24:46,217
[SPEAKER_09]: Clap Trap, he does a wedding proposal, marriage proposal video for this fan.

1014
01:24:46,817 --> 01:24:48,097
[SPEAKER_09]: It took him about a week to make it.

1015
01:24:48,597 --> 01:24:57,279
[SPEAKER_09]: It addresses her by name, so the band was like, hey, I want you to look at... So Borderlands, you know, helped them get to know each other.

1016
01:24:57,299 --> 01:25:00,040
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they got divorced in three months.

1017
01:25:00,060 --> 01:25:01,420
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

1018
01:25:01,620 --> 01:25:02,200
[SPEAKER_09]: Nothing but the best.

1019
01:25:02,220 --> 01:25:04,221
[SPEAKER_09]: See, it's called Borderlands Modest Proposal.

1020
01:25:04,281 --> 01:25:07,222
[SPEAKER_09]: The YouTube channel is Taco Bell Manager.

1021
01:25:07,822 --> 01:25:08,342
[SPEAKER_09]: Laughter

1022
01:25:10,791 --> 01:25:37,465
[SPEAKER_06]: yeah sorry this is really funny Gearbox helped these this loving I hope you like Borderlands and I hope you like Gorditas because you're gonna get a lot of that and I haven't had a chance to watch about a minute and a half and I guess they got their writers to put in some jokes and yeah so took him a week to do that yeah Lord game companies work slow all right I'm just kidding I'm kidding

1023
01:25:38,917 --> 01:25:41,219
[SPEAKER_06]: They got paid in 39 cent tacos.

1024
01:25:42,399 --> 01:25:46,622
[SPEAKER_09]: Next we have a story about YouTube video sensation Freddie Wong.

1025
01:25:47,602 --> 01:25:51,364
[SPEAKER_09]: I looked through his channel and I don't recognize a lot of his stuff.

1026
01:25:51,965 --> 01:25:53,505
[SPEAKER_09]: He put out a character.

1027
01:25:53,966 --> 01:25:59,389
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess he's a computer animator and he does a lot of YouTube mini-movies.

1028
01:26:00,229 --> 01:26:21,425
[SPEAKER_09]: and he put out a character called Mr. Toots Mr. Toots is a tiny knee-high unicorn and this here it's half live action half CGI and Freddie Wong finds Mr. Toots in a cardboard box out on the street and Mr. Toots is a little knee-high unicorn that shoots rainbows out of its ass

1029
01:26:22,806 --> 01:26:29,608
[SPEAKER_09]: So those of you that are into robot unicorn attack or just rainbow unicorn fandom hilariousness.

1030
01:26:30,208 --> 01:26:32,429
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I love rainbow unicorns.

1031
01:26:32,789 --> 01:26:34,530
[SPEAKER_02]: This is that guy that did that Portal video.

1032
01:26:35,290 --> 01:26:35,750
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, is it?

1033
01:26:36,010 --> 01:26:37,050
[SPEAKER_02]: The Portal gun delivery.

1034
01:26:37,070 --> 01:26:37,691
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let me see.

1035
01:26:38,031 --> 01:26:39,631
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm looking at the video here in studio.

1036
01:26:39,831 --> 01:26:43,072
[SPEAKER_09]: So here's the, he lifts up the box and there's the little.

1037
01:26:43,232 --> 01:26:43,512
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, hold on.

1038
01:26:43,532 --> 01:26:44,093
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm watching it here.

1039
01:26:44,133 --> 01:26:45,533
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like two seconds behind you.

1040
01:26:45,553 --> 01:26:47,334
[SPEAKER_06]: That is a creepy looking unicorn.

1041
01:26:47,534 --> 01:26:48,374
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, there's the unicorn.

1042
01:26:48,394 --> 01:26:49,194
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, look at you.

1043
01:26:49,334 --> 01:26:50,895
[SPEAKER_04]: You little horse thing.

1044
01:26:51,535 --> 01:26:52,055
[SPEAKER_04]: What's your name?

1045
01:26:53,191 --> 01:26:58,394
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything okay, huh?

1046
01:26:58,414 --> 01:27:00,515
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, looks like we got a car coming, so let's get out of the road, huh?

1047
01:27:02,536 --> 01:27:07,479
[SPEAKER_04]: Shit, is that a rainbow?

1048
01:27:07,739 --> 01:27:08,400
[SPEAKER_02]: No, dude, look out!

1049
01:27:10,034 --> 01:27:13,095
[SPEAKER_06]: My favorite is the dude exploding and like the Mortal Kombat blood all over it.

1050
01:27:13,155 --> 01:27:14,615
[SPEAKER_09]: And the skeleton.

1051
01:27:15,076 --> 01:27:28,740
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is gaming related because it turns out that Mr. Toots has been copyrighted and registered to Volition Inc., the developer behind THQ's Red Faction and Saints Row series.

1052
01:27:29,760 --> 01:27:42,509
[SPEAKER_09]: So whether the character came first and the THQ snatched it up or he was commissioned for this little dude, we're like, what on earth is Volition going to do with this character?

1053
01:27:42,549 --> 01:27:44,651
[SPEAKER_02]: This guy actually borrowed the model.

1054
01:27:45,611 --> 01:27:46,552
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

1055
01:27:46,612 --> 01:27:47,912
[SPEAKER_02]: He credits him in the end of the video.

1056
01:27:48,112 --> 01:27:49,573
[SPEAKER_02]: He borrowed the model from somebody.

1057
01:27:49,673 --> 01:27:51,634
[SPEAKER_02]: So it could be like some cross promotion.

1058
01:27:51,754 --> 01:27:55,175
[SPEAKER_06]: And see, I love this joke in our chat room from Randy because somebody had to make this joke.

1059
01:27:55,215 --> 01:27:56,416
[SPEAKER_06]: Chat.orange.com.

1060
01:27:56,776 --> 01:27:58,717
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Toots and the pink anus.

1061
01:27:59,377 --> 01:28:02,719
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember the magical unicorn game on Steam with the pink anus?

1062
01:28:03,559 --> 01:28:05,560
[SPEAKER_06]: A-E-N-U-S that you buy as a material.

1063
01:28:05,680 --> 01:28:05,900
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1064
01:28:06,520 --> 01:28:07,881
[SPEAKER_06]: Lots of anus going on in this game.

1065
01:28:08,874 --> 01:28:15,720
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah, so it does look like that Mr. Toots came from THQ first and then this Freddie Wong guy did the promotional thing for it.

1066
01:28:16,280 --> 01:28:17,581
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what's funny about the anus?

1067
01:28:17,741 --> 01:28:18,462
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1068
01:28:18,502 --> 01:28:19,823
[SPEAKER_09]: Everything's funny about anus.

1069
01:28:20,303 --> 01:28:23,986
[SPEAKER_02]: I always get it confused with this candy in Japan called ASSE.

1070
01:28:24,166 --> 01:28:25,988
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess it's assay or ass.

1071
01:28:26,748 --> 01:28:28,710
[SPEAKER_06]: But it looks like ass when you eat it in the box.

1072
01:28:29,150 --> 01:28:30,612
[SPEAKER_06]: Mmm, tastes like ass!

1073
01:28:30,912 --> 01:28:31,012
[SPEAKER_06]: Mmm!

1074
01:28:33,658 --> 01:28:41,323
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, the biggest part of this story is just the whole what factor and the fact that it's from Volition, so where are they going to drop this dude?

1075
01:28:41,403 --> 01:28:43,544
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe he'll be a playable character in Saints Row 3.

1076
01:28:43,785 --> 01:28:50,369
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, you're running... You're on drug missions, and instead of getting an Uzi, you're just shooting rainbows out of your ass at people.

1077
01:28:51,069 --> 01:28:51,470
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1078
01:28:52,250 --> 01:28:52,430
[SPEAKER_09]: Ass.

1079
01:28:54,091 --> 01:28:56,073
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, DarkSakura, for derailing the show with ass.

1080
01:28:57,543 --> 01:29:12,551
[SPEAKER_09]: My last quickfire story is even though Activision has pulled the plug on the XYZ Hero franchises, be it guitar or DJ, it looks like DJ Hero 2 is getting at least one more DLC pack.

1081
01:29:12,611 --> 01:29:14,812
[SPEAKER_09]: Not sure if it's the last, but it's still getting content.

1082
01:29:15,673 --> 01:29:17,754
[SPEAKER_09]: It's an Ultra Mix pack by...

1083
01:29:20,115 --> 01:29:20,776
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm blanking.

1084
01:29:21,036 --> 01:29:21,737
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me just add it up here.

1085
01:29:23,058 --> 01:29:23,518
[SPEAKER_09]: Deadmau5.

1086
01:29:23,698 --> 01:29:23,999
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

1087
01:29:24,059 --> 01:29:29,203
[SPEAKER_09]: Deadmau5 is putting out a three-song track pack for DJ Hero 2.

1088
01:29:29,884 --> 01:29:38,591
[SPEAKER_09]: House Music by Benny Benassi, Sophie Needs a Ladder by Deadmau5, and We Speak No Americano by Yolanda B. Cool and DCUP.

1089
01:29:39,952 --> 01:29:40,593
[SPEAKER_06]: C-U-P.

1090
01:29:40,613 --> 01:29:40,693
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1091
01:29:42,848 --> 01:29:43,688
[SPEAKER_06]: Womp womp.

1092
01:29:44,129 --> 01:29:44,749
[SPEAKER_06]: You're gross.

1093
01:29:45,289 --> 01:29:45,589
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1094
01:29:46,509 --> 01:29:46,990
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything else?

1095
01:29:47,770 --> 01:29:48,270
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it for me.

1096
01:29:48,450 --> 01:29:48,750
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1097
01:29:48,830 --> 01:29:52,532
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go to the other music game that comes up once in a while on this program.

1098
01:29:52,552 --> 01:29:53,792
[SPEAKER_06]: It used to come up a lot on this program.

1099
01:29:54,132 --> 01:29:59,594
[SPEAKER_06]: Beatmania 2DX is having its 19th version being tested.

1100
01:30:00,095 --> 01:30:01,295
[SPEAKER_06]: It's called Linkle.

1101
01:30:02,415 --> 01:30:03,736
[SPEAKER_06]: Not sure what that's supposed to mean.

1102
01:30:03,896 --> 01:30:05,597
[SPEAKER_06]: It's L-I-N-C-L-E, Linkle.

1103
01:30:06,277 --> 01:30:08,538
[SPEAKER_06]: It kind of looks like Uncle, but with the U kind of.

1104
01:30:08,558 --> 01:30:09,738
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that would be a better name.

1105
01:30:10,098 --> 01:30:11,039
[SPEAKER_06]: Beatmania 2DX 19, Uncle.

1106
01:30:12,339 --> 01:30:13,961
[SPEAKER_06]: Uncle, make it stop.

1107
01:30:14,021 --> 01:30:15,622
[SPEAKER_06]: These songs don't sound the same.

1108
01:30:15,682 --> 01:30:16,383
[SPEAKER_09]: What was 17 and 18?

1109
01:30:16,463 --> 01:30:18,124
[SPEAKER_09]: It was like Duchess, Empress.

1110
01:30:18,244 --> 01:30:19,145
[SPEAKER_06]: One was Empress.

1111
01:30:19,225 --> 01:30:19,565
[SPEAKER_06]: You got it.

1112
01:30:19,646 --> 01:30:20,326
[SPEAKER_06]: Empress was one.

1113
01:30:20,366 --> 01:30:21,667
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the other one was Sirius.

1114
01:30:22,148 --> 01:30:23,289
[SPEAKER_06]: But not like the radio.

1115
01:30:23,369 --> 01:30:24,990
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the constellation in the sky.

1116
01:30:25,010 --> 01:30:25,991
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1117
01:30:26,291 --> 01:30:27,292
[SPEAKER_06]: So this one is Linkle.

1118
01:30:27,973 --> 01:30:28,854
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know.

1119
01:30:28,874 --> 01:30:30,935
[SPEAKER_06]: It kind of has like a sci-fi theme going on.

1120
01:30:30,975 --> 01:30:31,296
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever.

1121
01:30:31,836 --> 01:30:34,679
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of the new games, or some of the new songs that are coming out in it.

1122
01:30:34,779 --> 01:30:36,902
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't even recognize these bands anymore.

1123
01:30:36,962 --> 01:30:38,504
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I used to be so into this series.

1124
01:30:38,944 --> 01:30:41,847
[SPEAKER_06]: Soda Fujimori, I remember him, with a song called Lucky Days.

1125
01:30:42,788 --> 01:30:44,851
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see, Coors K, Drive Me Crazy.

1126
01:30:45,972 --> 01:30:46,452
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember...

1127
01:30:48,094 --> 01:30:49,055
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching!

1128
01:31:02,946 --> 01:31:08,331
[SPEAKER_06]: So we get a song called F. Some of the other things that are coming to 2DX 19th style as I will forever call it.

1129
01:31:08,971 --> 01:31:11,033
[SPEAKER_06]: A light blue theme apparently in the game.

1130
01:31:12,694 --> 01:31:15,617
[SPEAKER_06]: Song previews have been added for normal gameplay mode.

1131
01:31:15,657 --> 01:31:16,217
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty cool.

1132
01:31:16,237 --> 01:31:19,940
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can actually hear what the song sounds like finally 19 games later.

1133
01:31:20,981 --> 01:31:23,203
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see a hard EX option added.

1134
01:31:23,603 --> 01:31:25,164
[SPEAKER_06]: It is even harder than hard.

1135
01:31:26,005 --> 01:31:27,226
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a direct quote.

1136
01:31:27,266 --> 01:31:27,986
[SPEAKER_06]: Harder than hard.

1137
01:31:28,906 --> 01:31:35,509
[SPEAKER_06]: And some songs, unfortunately, have been removed from the game because, you know, they have to delete old songs to make room for the new ones.

1138
01:31:35,849 --> 01:31:39,851
[SPEAKER_06]: Luckily, because I don't follow the series anymore, I don't recognize any of these songs that they've removed.

1139
01:31:41,943 --> 01:31:42,523
[SPEAKER_06]: But there you go.

1140
01:31:42,624 --> 01:31:44,405
[SPEAKER_06]: Beatmania 2DX, Linkle.

1141
01:31:44,825 --> 01:31:49,769
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I would care about Beatmania 2DX again if they would put out the home versions.

1142
01:31:49,909 --> 01:31:51,150
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially if they came out on PlayStation 3.

1143
01:31:51,210 --> 01:31:53,211
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, PlayStation 3, because it's not region coded.

1144
01:31:53,651 --> 01:31:54,332
[SPEAKER_09]: Bring it out already!

1145
01:31:54,372 --> 01:31:57,174
[SPEAKER_09]: And you have your controllers that we packed, and I want to play those.

1146
01:31:57,194 --> 01:32:00,396
[SPEAKER_01]: We're already getting Tingle things in the chatroom, by the way.

1147
01:32:00,536 --> 01:32:01,297
[SPEAKER_01]: Tingle and Linkle?

1148
01:32:02,017 --> 01:32:02,298
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

1149
01:32:03,959 --> 01:32:08,342
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Tingle... If Tingle and Link had a baby, it would be Linkle.

1150
01:32:09,640 --> 01:32:12,906
[SPEAKER_06]: BlackWolf in our chatroom says, 2DX lives on where Guitar Hero dies.

1151
01:32:13,908 --> 01:32:17,594
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, in Japan anyway, but you don't really see anything about it here.

1152
01:32:18,396 --> 01:32:21,521
[SPEAKER_09]: They should have an insane 4 controller version where you use your toes.

1153
01:32:22,704 --> 01:32:26,907
[SPEAKER_06]: BVM2DX was a lot of fun, it really was Bring back the effector pedal!

1154
01:32:27,187 --> 01:32:34,852
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, two arcades have it anymore You know, Arcade Infinity is gone You can go to what, Sunnyvale Golf Line or Milpitas?

1155
01:32:34,932 --> 01:32:49,141
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the two still has it And they got rid of ours That's one arcade in the Bay Area They probably have the one that RVGL got rid of Maybe That's so stupid they didn't get rid of 2DX Oh, DarkSakura says they deleted Power Dream I did like that song

1156
01:32:50,339 --> 01:32:50,699
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

1157
01:32:50,739 --> 01:32:52,781
[SPEAKER_02]: We just need to have a Bimani party.

1158
01:32:54,283 --> 01:32:54,883
[SPEAKER_06]: No, we don't.

1159
01:32:55,003 --> 01:32:55,444
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we do.

1160
01:32:56,585 --> 01:32:59,748
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless you're going to kick it like it's, you know, 2002 all over again.

1161
01:32:59,768 --> 01:33:00,208
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

1162
01:33:00,288 --> 01:33:06,914
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, after three songs and we're all covered in sweat because we're not in the shape that we used to be in doing nine-footer songs.

1163
01:33:07,215 --> 01:33:08,676
[SPEAKER_02]: No, and that's just from playing 2DX.

1164
01:33:10,017 --> 01:33:10,277
Nice.

1165
01:33:11,318 --> 01:33:12,259
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, some other things.

1166
01:33:12,739 --> 01:33:22,867
[SPEAKER_06]: An Xbox exclusive Mortal Kombat fighter was discussed, according to Ed Boon, saying, quote, Unfortunately, the circumstances didn't allow us to make a 360 exclusive character.

1167
01:33:23,268 --> 01:33:29,433
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not allowed to talk too much about it, but I can tell you we certainly wanted to do an exclusive for 360, but that's all I can say.

1168
01:33:29,933 --> 01:33:34,897
[SPEAKER_06]: And unfortunately, that's leaving everybody to try and guess what could the character have been?

1169
01:33:35,516 --> 01:33:44,279
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the, well, I can't really think of that many iconic Microsoft licensed only characters they have because Kratos obviously is a Sony only property.

1170
01:33:44,299 --> 01:33:45,360
[SPEAKER_09]: He's very recognizable.

1171
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:47,561
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the Gears of War dudes.

1172
01:33:47,901 --> 01:33:49,221
[SPEAKER_09]: Marcus Fenix.

1173
01:33:49,541 --> 01:33:55,164
[SPEAKER_09]: Master Chief, which would be kind of dumb in that universe because at least Kratos has got the whole medieval and the blades.

1174
01:33:55,584 --> 01:33:55,844
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

1175
01:33:56,624 --> 01:33:58,466
[SPEAKER_06]: How about that chick from Cameo?

1176
01:33:58,506 --> 01:33:59,727
[SPEAKER_06]: What's she doing these days?

1177
01:34:00,528 --> 01:34:01,849
[SPEAKER_06]: That could have been the character.

1178
01:34:01,949 --> 01:34:04,952
[SPEAKER_09]: She's playing Uno with the Cameo Uno pack.

1179
01:34:05,412 --> 01:34:07,594
[SPEAKER_06]: Or a nondescript dude from Fable.

1180
01:34:07,975 --> 01:34:11,097
[SPEAKER_06]: I think probably what Microsoft had a problem with was the fatalities.

1181
01:34:11,878 --> 01:34:27,154
[SPEAKER_09]: and it's, you know, to have your character die a horrible death is something that's hard for some people God of War already had the rendered guts and the eviscerations and the titties for no reason so Kratos is at home in Mortal Kombat Right

1182
01:34:28,075 --> 01:34:49,774
[SPEAKER_06]: Microsoft doesn't really have a character like that unless chat can think of one that we're forgetting unless you know Matt I don't I don't see them splitting Master Chief in half and his little midsection it's gross some of those fatalities are gross which by the way I am gonna try and get that video of my mom playing Mortal Kombat just you know working on that I told her about the project today she's like what

1183
01:34:50,594 --> 01:34:51,655
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah.

1184
01:34:51,715 --> 01:34:53,515
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I don't know what character it could have possibly been.

1185
01:34:53,535 --> 01:34:57,477
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, if it had been Marcus Fenix or something, I think the problem would have been with the fatalities.

1186
01:34:57,917 --> 01:34:59,738
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why they had to change up DC Universe.

1187
01:34:59,798 --> 01:35:03,640
[SPEAKER_06]: But, I mean, it's one thing to do it for a single Xbox character.

1188
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,641
[SPEAKER_06]: It's another to change the game for DC Universe.

1189
01:35:06,681 --> 01:35:11,303
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's why they... I'm sorry, THE DC Universe, not to be confused with the game DC Universe.

1190
01:35:11,743 --> 01:35:12,343
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean, though.

1191
01:35:13,304 --> 01:35:13,424
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

1192
01:35:14,764 --> 01:35:18,207
[SPEAKER_06]: One other quick thing I want to say, it's about the 3DS Ocarina of Time.

1193
01:35:18,227 --> 01:35:19,928
[SPEAKER_06]: We all know that game is coming out on the 3DS.

1194
01:35:19,948 --> 01:35:22,210
[SPEAKER_06]: That's another big thing they're going to pimp for this holiday season.

1195
01:35:22,730 --> 01:35:25,512
[SPEAKER_06]: There's going to be a new feature in the game called the Boss Challenge Mode.

1196
01:35:25,832 --> 01:35:27,113
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an all-fighting mode.

1197
01:35:27,394 --> 01:35:30,256
[SPEAKER_06]: You go up against any of the bosses you've encountered on the main quest.

1198
01:35:30,856 --> 01:35:34,539
[SPEAKER_06]: You can take on the bosses individually or all at once in a continuous battle.

1199
01:35:34,859 --> 01:35:35,580
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all we know.

1200
01:35:35,780 --> 01:35:38,622
[SPEAKER_06]: One little unlock feature that will be in the game, an extra mode.

1201
01:35:39,122 --> 01:35:45,573
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of sounds a little silly to me, but I guess whatever extra crap they can throw in there to make it seem worth it again, they will do.

1202
01:35:46,195 --> 01:35:46,735
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll see.

1203
01:35:47,472 --> 01:35:48,813
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, you got a few stories for us?

1204
01:35:49,213 --> 01:35:49,753
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a few.

1205
01:35:50,254 --> 01:35:55,137
[SPEAKER_02]: Konami Style, which is notable for often having pretty expensive stuff up there.

1206
01:35:55,257 --> 01:35:58,859
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember the arcade style 2DX and poppin' music controllers?

1207
01:36:00,280 --> 01:36:04,562
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they have a $380 Pyramid Head sculpture now.

1208
01:36:05,183 --> 01:36:06,183
[SPEAKER_02]: It's up for pre-order.

1209
01:36:06,824 --> 01:36:13,428
[SPEAKER_02]: Tomopop is basically saying this is the only officially licensed Pyramid Head to date.

1210
01:36:14,368 --> 01:36:19,510
[SPEAKER_02]: The actual price is 31,500 yen, or about 382 bucks.

1211
01:36:20,271 --> 01:36:23,032
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a pretty sick looking figure, I gotta say.

1212
01:36:23,132 --> 01:36:33,616
[SPEAKER_02]: This is, he's all, you know, wearing his skin, you know, outfit with the big pyramid on his head and the great knife.

1213
01:36:33,676 --> 01:36:36,617
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's actually specifically Silent Hill Homecoming.

1214
01:36:37,578 --> 01:36:38,718
[SPEAKER_02]: So it looks pretty cool.

1215
01:36:38,758 --> 01:36:40,999
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to show our chat room what it looks like.

1216
01:36:41,259 --> 01:36:42,140
[SPEAKER_02]: None of you will get to see.

1217
01:36:42,200 --> 01:36:42,980
[SPEAKER_02]: Ha ha ha ha ha.

1218
01:36:45,592 --> 01:36:46,172
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go, chat room.

1219
01:37:15,638 --> 01:37:18,987
[SPEAKER_06]: That could have been the character in the game, because imagine how that fatality would have worked.

1220
01:37:20,134 --> 01:37:23,977
[SPEAKER_06]: The fatality would have been you would have had to run like in Wii Fit.

1221
01:37:24,177 --> 01:37:24,538
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1222
01:37:25,018 --> 01:37:31,683
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm imagining Mario and Luigi in a Mortal Kombat game now where they take a monkey wrench and just shove it through someone's throat.

1223
01:37:32,204 --> 01:37:34,085
[SPEAKER_09]: All these angry parents writing letters.

1224
01:37:34,325 --> 01:37:35,306
[SPEAKER_09]: I love it.

1225
01:37:35,566 --> 01:37:35,967
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1226
01:37:37,248 --> 01:37:37,768
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe someday.

1227
01:37:37,988 --> 01:37:38,469
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, Jamie.

1228
01:37:38,789 --> 01:37:39,610
[SPEAKER_06]: I just had to get that out there.

1229
01:37:39,650 --> 01:37:40,931
[SPEAKER_06]: I love the clippy one too much.

1230
01:37:41,291 --> 01:37:43,353
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good idea for a character.

1231
01:37:43,373 --> 01:37:43,793
[SPEAKER_02]: That's okay.

1232
01:37:43,833 --> 01:37:45,454
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going, Microsoft Bob.

1233
01:37:45,895 --> 01:37:46,775
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome figure.

1234
01:37:46,895 --> 01:37:47,996
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome figure is awesome.

1235
01:37:49,537 --> 01:37:54,159
[SPEAKER_02]: and in Portal 2, the little egg-shaped turrets have an Easter egg.

1236
01:37:54,879 --> 01:38:00,160
[SPEAKER_02]: I have not heard this, so I'm going to have to check it out myself later, but it's on YouTube.

1237
01:38:00,200 --> 01:38:01,121
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys can check it out.

1238
01:38:03,161 --> 01:38:04,242
[SPEAKER_06]: Should I be bringing this up here?

1239
01:38:05,122 --> 01:38:05,662
[SPEAKER_02]: If you like.

1240
01:38:06,062 --> 01:38:08,003
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll go read the next story while you do that.

1241
01:38:08,023 --> 01:38:09,023
[SPEAKER_02]: I got it, I got it, I got it.

1242
01:38:09,963 --> 01:38:11,784
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a little, what, this is a little song they sing?

1243
01:38:11,824 --> 01:38:11,944
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1244
01:38:11,964 --> 01:38:12,244
[SPEAKER_02]: What is this?

1245
01:38:13,464 --> 01:38:14,645
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like around level 16.

1246
01:38:20,856 --> 01:38:22,237
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to see if I recognize this level.

1247
01:38:24,958 --> 01:38:25,858
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me skip ahead a little bit.

1248
01:38:33,202 --> 01:38:38,984
[SPEAKER_09]: The turrets serenading you is an event that happens later in the game.

1249
01:38:39,204 --> 01:38:43,646
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember seeing this part in one of the levels where the turrets were unreachable.

1250
01:38:43,666 --> 01:38:46,688
[SPEAKER_06]: This part looks familiar to me, but I don't remember them singing like this.

1251
01:38:47,208 --> 01:38:47,508
[SPEAKER_06]: Weird.

1252
01:38:49,749 --> 01:38:52,572
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, anyway.

1253
01:38:53,112 --> 01:38:59,478
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be funny if, when you're doing the defective turrets, if you could get one that sings instead of the I'm a turret!

1254
01:39:00,398 --> 01:39:00,779
[SPEAKER_02]: Turret.

1255
01:39:01,199 --> 01:39:06,603
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, all of the lethal functioning turrets are female, but the incompetent dunce turrets are male.

1256
01:39:07,684 --> 01:39:10,527
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's, well, and the same goes with Wheatley.

1257
01:39:11,728 --> 01:39:11,888
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1258
01:39:11,908 --> 01:39:11,988
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1259
01:39:12,628 --> 01:39:25,536
[SPEAKER_02]: But I've noticed that actually something that they pointed out in the first portal is that there's so much female oriented stuff in the game like bring your daughter to work day and GLaDOS being female and the main character being female.

1260
01:39:25,636 --> 01:39:27,357
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're just keeping up with that theme.

1261
01:39:27,577 --> 01:39:27,717
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1262
01:39:28,077 --> 01:39:28,738
[SPEAKER_06]: Go power.

1263
01:39:29,498 --> 01:39:33,981
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like the Silent Hill movie before they added the needless character Sean Bean.

1264
01:39:34,770 --> 01:39:39,016
[SPEAKER_02]: Unrecoverable Black Screen and Elevator Save

1265
01:39:50,310 --> 01:40:16,821
[SPEAKER_02]: fixed infinite loop on Mac OS X server fixed Mac OS X font rendering and glyph corruption fixed GC memory leak various location content improvements support for English subtitles and Turkish builds because people in Turkey love their portal minor string interface glitches, fixes for multiple crashes, improved detection handling for various errors and or crashes activated UI to enable joystick in game, that's pretty cool

1266
01:40:18,242 --> 01:40:25,310
[SPEAKER_02]: However, it did get a 10 out of 10 from Eurogamer, so I think it's pretty sweet.

1267
01:40:26,211 --> 01:40:27,012
[SPEAKER_02]: It's sick!

1268
01:40:28,353 --> 01:40:28,794
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's it.

1269
01:40:30,376 --> 01:40:30,596
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

1270
01:40:34,440 --> 01:40:43,409
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to say part of the reason that they had to give the Turkish language support was that Hakan from Street Fighter 4 threatened to kick their ass if they didn't add that.

1271
01:40:43,649 --> 01:40:46,572
[SPEAKER_02]: He was going to threaten to oil himself up and send nude photos.

1272
01:40:46,592 --> 01:40:49,655
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, he was going to oil himself up and send nude pictures if that didn't happen.

1273
01:40:50,905 --> 01:40:51,765
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go to the Twitter.

1274
01:40:51,905 --> 01:40:52,666
[SPEAKER_06]: Get some Twitter topics.

1275
01:40:52,706 --> 01:40:54,186
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, shit, I forgot to ask for them.

1276
01:40:54,206 --> 01:40:59,088
[SPEAKER_06]: So we may not have anything on Twitter, but let's see what happens if I go to the Twitter at twitter.com slash OLR.

1277
01:40:59,108 --> 01:41:01,769
[SPEAKER_06]: And let's see what happens when Rob forgets to request these things.

1278
01:41:02,570 --> 01:41:03,970
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see if we got anything anyway.

1279
01:41:04,010 --> 01:41:04,410
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

1280
01:41:04,510 --> 01:41:05,311
[SPEAKER_06]: Logging into Twitter.

1281
01:41:06,931 --> 01:41:08,592
[SPEAKER_06]: Clearly I'm prepared for this segment tonight.

1282
01:41:08,612 --> 01:41:09,892
[SPEAKER_06]: Twitter.com slash OLR.

1283
01:41:10,553 --> 01:41:11,913
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, we do have some tweets.

1284
01:41:12,093 --> 01:41:12,433
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at this.

1285
01:41:13,294 --> 01:41:13,574
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

1286
01:41:16,497 --> 01:41:25,268
[SPEAKER_06]: Redertainment says on Twitter, given her biting yet funny insults, how do you think GLaDOS would deliver a Yo Mana joke?

1287
01:41:25,308 --> 01:41:29,173
[SPEAKER_06]: I think he meant to say Yo Mama, but he typed Yo Mana, which is actually really funny.

1288
01:41:29,193 --> 01:41:29,634
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know why.

1289
01:41:29,654 --> 01:41:30,374
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be this.

1290
01:41:30,995 --> 01:41:31,936
[SPEAKER_02]: Your mother is dead.

1291
01:41:35,845 --> 01:41:36,426
[SPEAKER_06]: That's very good.

1292
01:41:36,466 --> 01:41:36,927
[SPEAKER_06]: I like that.

1293
01:41:37,207 --> 01:41:39,030
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a joke in there.

1294
01:41:40,792 --> 01:41:44,237
[SPEAKER_06]: SSJ100Matt is on Twitter saying, Hey, it's Easter.

1295
01:41:44,818 --> 01:41:46,300
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever happened to peep jousting?

1296
01:41:46,881 --> 01:41:51,188
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, what's your favorite totally not kosher for Passover Easter candy?

1297
01:41:52,372 --> 01:41:54,033
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh, good question.

1298
01:41:54,593 --> 01:41:55,213
[SPEAKER_02]: Waffles.

1299
01:41:55,653 --> 01:41:58,595
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't have waffles today.

1300
01:41:58,635 --> 01:41:59,755
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted waffles so bad.

1301
01:42:01,516 --> 01:42:02,517
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever happened to peep jousting?

1302
01:42:02,817 --> 01:42:05,798
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I was trying to explain peep jousting to my mother this morning.

1303
01:42:06,398 --> 01:42:06,618
[SPEAKER_06]: Right?

1304
01:42:06,979 --> 01:42:07,499
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember?

1305
01:42:08,039 --> 01:42:08,719
[SPEAKER_06]: You brought it up.

1306
01:42:09,780 --> 01:42:10,500
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, there's a very...

1307
01:42:13,875 --> 01:42:21,377
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, you're either someone that doesn't mind peeps, or will eat them, or you think they're the most vile fucking candy on the face of the earth.

1308
01:42:21,478 --> 01:42:22,298
[SPEAKER_09]: Vile, vile, vile, vile.

1309
01:42:22,658 --> 01:42:30,761
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, so we brought up peeps at the Easter breakfast, and Rob's mom and I think aunt...

1310
01:42:32,501 --> 01:42:34,462
[SPEAKER_09]: You say the two relatives were like, oh, peeps.

1311
01:42:35,463 --> 01:42:38,664
[SPEAKER_09]: My cousin-in-law.

1312
01:42:39,185 --> 01:42:42,887
[SPEAKER_09]: So they were going through their whole peeps are gross rant, and we mentioned peep jousting.

1313
01:42:43,167 --> 01:42:49,290
[SPEAKER_06]: That was after my cousin's son, who's nine years old, was threatening to look up the show on the internet.

1314
01:42:49,330 --> 01:42:50,631
[SPEAKER_06]: So God, I hope he didn't find it.

1315
01:42:51,992 --> 01:42:53,092
[SPEAKER_06]: If so, you need to turn it off.

1316
01:42:54,773 --> 01:42:56,414
[SPEAKER_06]: Your mother's going to kick your butt.

1317
01:42:59,356 --> 01:43:02,759
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm surprised that there wasn't more bacon at the event.

1318
01:43:02,879 --> 01:43:04,560
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's not get into that.

1319
01:43:06,182 --> 01:43:07,383
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, peep jousting.

1320
01:43:07,443 --> 01:43:07,703
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1321
01:43:07,723 --> 01:43:09,144
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't done peep jousting in a long time.

1322
01:43:09,665 --> 01:43:11,066
[SPEAKER_06]: What about the other part of the question?

1323
01:43:11,126 --> 01:43:14,829
[SPEAKER_06]: What's your favorite totally not kosher for Passover Easter candy?

1324
01:43:15,209 --> 01:43:21,471
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem with that is that candy would be okay as long as it's not made with flour.

1325
01:43:21,491 --> 01:43:24,332
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like something with a crust.

1326
01:43:25,732 --> 01:43:26,032
[SPEAKER_02]: Pocky?

1327
01:43:26,092 --> 01:43:28,213
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you couldn't have Pocky.

1328
01:43:28,733 --> 01:43:30,594
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't really think a Pocky would be strong.

1329
01:43:32,546 --> 01:43:33,247
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

1330
01:43:48,743 --> 01:43:49,103
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

1331
01:44:08,303 --> 01:44:35,508
[SPEAKER_02]: now I'm imagining chocolate covered chicken and that would just be gross go to any state fair in the south well you're from the south, you know it would be chocolate covered chicken deep fried in like bacon fat ew alright we got some other I will tell you one thing my friend made bacon brownies I see that I told her that when all this is over she used to make me some turkey bacon brownies what about you?

[SPEAKER_06]: The Reese's Peanut Butter Cup Eggs Just because it's just a big flat peanut butter cup And those are amazing You know what I don't like are cream eggs I can't People worship those things But they are too much They are too much They have those mini cream eggs now Those I can eat Sells Mars Eggs

1334
01:44:58,931 --> 01:44:59,372
[SPEAKER_02]: Marzipan?

1335
01:44:59,652 --> 01:45:00,873
[SPEAKER_02]: No, Mars Bars eggs.

1336
01:45:01,033 --> 01:45:01,433
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

1337
01:45:01,693 --> 01:45:05,636
[SPEAKER_02]: And they also have these dark chocolate truffle eggs.

1338
01:45:06,516 --> 01:45:12,620
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there are all kinds of cream eggs sold in England, and these are just... They're all Cadbury, the ones that they carry.

1339
01:45:12,640 --> 01:45:13,541
[SPEAKER_02]: They also have the...

1340
01:45:15,914 --> 01:45:18,195
[SPEAKER_02]: The Galaxy ones.

1341
01:45:18,315 --> 01:45:18,995
[SPEAKER_02]: They sell those too.

1342
01:45:19,196 --> 01:45:20,016
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Aero ones.

[SPEAKER_02]: They're all puffed air chocolate eggs.

01:45:22,097 --> 01:45:22,437
[SPEAKER_02]: So good.

1345
01:45:22,517 --> 01:45:22,737
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

1346
01:45:23,498 --> 01:45:24,478
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to go get my Mars egg.

1347
01:45:24,658 --> 01:45:26,039
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me get to some more tweets.

1348
01:45:26,119 --> 01:45:27,459
[SPEAKER_06]: Flaming Toilet is tweeting us.

1349
01:45:27,619 --> 01:45:34,383
[SPEAKER_06]: Upgrading to a new Slim PlayStation 3 and tired of waiting for PSN to come back.

1350
01:45:34,963 --> 01:45:39,285
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it okay to do data transfer utility or do I risk losing data?

1351
01:45:40,649 --> 01:45:41,110
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1352
01:45:41,150 --> 01:45:41,990
[SPEAKER_09]: I have no idea.

1353
01:45:42,491 --> 01:45:45,254
[SPEAKER_09]: Data transfer between his old system and his new one?

1354
01:45:45,334 --> 01:45:46,155
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I'm assuming.

1355
01:45:46,435 --> 01:45:47,536
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1356
01:45:47,556 --> 01:45:48,977
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of like a license transfer, I'm assuming.

1357
01:45:48,997 --> 01:45:50,019
[SPEAKER_06]: Like what you do on 360?

1358
01:45:50,099 --> 01:45:51,140
[SPEAKER_06]: I've never had to do that before.

1359
01:45:52,341 --> 01:45:53,662
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't risk it.

1360
01:45:53,722 --> 01:45:55,584
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly, right now, not a good time to try that.

1361
01:45:55,604 --> 01:45:59,188
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it... Depending on when his slim was...

1362
01:46:00,575 --> 01:46:02,375
[SPEAKER_09]: are manufactured and put on the shelves.

1363
01:46:02,456 --> 01:46:04,856
[SPEAKER_09]: He's probably a few OS updates behind.

1364
01:46:05,556 --> 01:46:09,657
[SPEAKER_09]: And that, once he actually gets the Slim online, it's like, oh, we need to update you to 3.6.

1365
01:46:10,758 --> 01:46:12,018
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what number they're on.

1366
01:46:12,358 --> 01:46:14,119
[SPEAKER_09]: And that might invalidate his certificates.

1367
01:46:14,359 --> 01:46:15,759
[SPEAKER_06]: So just wait.

1368
01:46:16,039 --> 01:46:16,419
[SPEAKER_06]: Good point.

1369
01:46:16,439 --> 01:46:17,620
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you're going to have to wait it out.

1370
01:46:17,720 --> 01:46:18,000
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

1371
01:46:19,640 --> 01:46:20,300
[SPEAKER_06]: And let's see.

1372
01:46:20,440 --> 01:46:23,561
[SPEAKER_06]: One more tweet from TigerClaw305 on Twitter says this tweet.

1373
01:46:23,961 --> 01:46:26,642
[SPEAKER_06]: The DS Lite is going to be discontinued.

1374
01:46:27,442 --> 01:46:37,870
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that was some news that was circulating this week, is that the DS Lite is no more, and he's linking us to a story on 1up.com that apparently references a NeoGAF post where there is documents going out.

1375
01:46:38,631 --> 01:46:46,276
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo is not offering any comment on this right now, but I guess some of the older DSes are being discontinued, which makes sense, I mean.

1376
01:46:46,356 --> 01:46:50,319
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I think every person in the developed world

1377
01:46:51,681 --> 01:46:53,364
[SPEAKER_09]: has one, including their pets.

1378
01:46:53,946 --> 01:46:55,288
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, my cat has a DS light.

1379
01:46:55,329 --> 01:46:55,709
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm kidding.

1380
01:46:56,130 --> 01:46:59,257
[SPEAKER_09]: But no, I think, yeah, that's... They're pretty...

1381
01:47:01,431 --> 01:47:01,811
[SPEAKER_09]: Prevalent.

1382
01:47:02,251 --> 01:47:06,993
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and they're not getting rid of the DSi or the DS XL.

1383
01:47:07,053 --> 01:47:07,593
[SPEAKER_06]: That's important to know.

1384
01:47:07,633 --> 01:47:09,113
[SPEAKER_09]: And I still want one of those too, but yeah.

1385
01:47:09,634 --> 01:47:10,934
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's no... Why?

1386
01:47:10,994 --> 01:47:12,074
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not just get the 3DS?

1387
01:47:12,675 --> 01:47:13,035
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1388
01:47:13,435 --> 01:47:14,215
[SPEAKER_06]: Those screens are big.

1389
01:47:14,815 --> 01:47:17,456
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, the 3DS is backwards compatible with the regular DS, right?

1390
01:47:17,536 --> 01:47:17,676
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

1391
01:47:17,956 --> 01:47:18,196
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1392
01:47:18,216 --> 01:47:19,557
[SPEAKER_06]: But not the advanced games.

1393
01:47:20,037 --> 01:47:22,138
[SPEAKER_06]: So you like must play Game Boy Advance games still?

1394
01:47:22,158 --> 01:47:24,638
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, they haven't had the GBA port on the DS in a while.

1395
01:47:25,359 --> 01:47:25,679
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's right.

1396
01:47:25,699 --> 01:47:26,819
[SPEAKER_06]: They got rid of that with the DSi.

1397
01:47:26,899 --> 01:47:27,059
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1398
01:47:27,479 --> 01:47:29,680
[SPEAKER_06]: So I guess that's the one thing you're losing with the DS Lite.

1399
01:47:30,160 --> 01:47:31,240
[SPEAKER_06]: No more Game Boy Advance games.

1400
01:47:31,881 --> 01:47:33,081
[SPEAKER_06]: So there you go.

1401
01:47:34,281 --> 01:47:34,701
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

1402
01:47:35,162 --> 01:47:35,902
[SPEAKER_06]: One more tweet.

1403
01:47:35,922 --> 01:47:37,422
[SPEAKER_06]: TigerClaw got in one more.

1404
01:47:37,522 --> 01:47:38,183
[SPEAKER_06]: And why not?

1405
01:47:38,203 --> 01:47:39,183
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll go ahead and read this one.

1406
01:47:40,183 --> 01:47:43,124
[SPEAKER_06]: Chrono Trigger apparently is also coming out.

1407
01:47:43,144 --> 01:47:45,965
[SPEAKER_06]: So I guess this is in the same vein as the Final Fantasy VI thing we heard about earlier.

1408
01:47:46,345 --> 01:47:52,307
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently Chrono Trigger for the PlayStation 3 and PSP was outed by an ESRB listing.

1409
01:47:52,567 --> 01:47:58,389
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is probably just right up the same alley as Final Fantasy VI because Chrono Trigger was released for the PlayStation 1.

1410
01:47:59,742 --> 01:48:02,905
[SPEAKER_09]: and yeah, so this is, yeah, the, what was that called?

1411
01:48:02,925 --> 01:48:05,187
[SPEAKER_09]: Was it the Final Fantasy Chronicles that had Chrono Trigger in it?

1412
01:48:05,247 --> 01:48:05,888
[SPEAKER_02]: It was Chronicles.

1413
01:48:05,908 --> 01:48:07,689
[SPEAKER_02]: Chronicles, yeah, the other one was the Anthology.

1414
01:48:07,990 --> 01:48:13,275
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, so it's probably just obviously a port of that because that's already been out on Sony.

1415
01:48:13,395 --> 01:48:22,263
[SPEAKER_09]: The DS port with the extra dungeon and the endings and stuff is probably still the better Chrono Trigger port.

1416
01:48:22,804 --> 01:48:25,107
[SPEAKER_09]: release that you'd want to get rather than this one.

1417
01:48:25,427 --> 01:48:28,231
[SPEAKER_06]: Give us a legit Chrono Trigger sequel already.

1418
01:48:28,311 --> 01:48:31,535
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I know there's Chrono Cross, but I mean, seriously, how long ago was that?

1419
01:48:32,336 --> 01:48:32,937
[SPEAKER_06]: Damn, Square.

1420
01:48:34,765 --> 01:49:03,165
[SPEAKER_06]: everybody loses their shit over that game and yet we still don't have like something in that canon it's weird one of the reasons why I still want a DS XL is because Chrono Trigger port on the DS I can see it fine it's not like I'm blind but just those sprites I want them on a bigger screen so fair enough yeah all right let's move on with some more gaming news and then we're gonna get to your phone calls before too long and emails we have lots of emails tonight can't wait to do that DarkSakura's got to work tonight

1421
01:49:03,536 --> 01:49:04,196
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1422
01:49:04,256 --> 01:49:04,617
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay.

1423
01:49:05,037 --> 01:49:05,317
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1424
01:49:05,817 --> 01:49:06,437
[SPEAKER_06]: Salacious Pop.

1425
01:49:06,778 --> 01:49:07,138
[SPEAKER_06]: More news.

1426
01:49:08,799 --> 01:49:23,786
[SPEAKER_09]: So after that, a couple weeks ago, we announced that the Mega Man project that Capcom was working on was scrapped, but they're still, from what we understand, working on Mega Man Legends 3 that has a huge fandom that really wants that game to come out.

1427
01:49:25,466 --> 01:49:32,590
[SPEAKER_09]: Capcom has announced that they are putting out a Mega Man Legends 3 prototype version, which is sort of a...

1428
01:49:33,470 --> 01:49:34,992
[SPEAKER_09]: Beta slash demo.

1429
01:49:35,132 --> 01:49:42,259
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure if it's going to have a full start to finish or it's a separate episode that may not necessarily be in the full release of the game.

1430
01:49:42,879 --> 01:49:46,443
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's just what they have compiled that runs well.

1431
01:49:46,463 --> 01:49:51,488
[SPEAKER_09]: They're going to put it out for the 3DS and on their eShop.

1432
01:49:52,109 --> 01:49:53,390
[SPEAKER_09]: It's supposed to hit in late May.

1433
01:49:54,731 --> 01:50:22,975
[SPEAKER_09]: and there's a playable character named Barret and it offers a few missions not to be confused with the first person ever to say shit in Final Fantasy just so you know so you play as Barret and it's going to have a few missions though it's probably going to be spammed with loading screen messages that just say this is not a finished product this is a game in progress any bugs blah blah blah so yeah we're going to get something but you're going to have to pay for it right let's see

1434
01:50:25,053 --> 01:50:26,174
[SPEAKER_06]: Quickly, let me throw this out here.

1435
01:50:26,394 --> 01:50:27,314
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going on the eShop.

1436
01:50:27,354 --> 01:50:28,274
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me throw this out here, too.

1437
01:50:28,294 --> 01:50:33,717
[SPEAKER_06]: A little follow-up to that is that I guess Capcom isn't really sold on this whole thing.

1438
01:50:34,777 --> 01:50:40,760
[SPEAKER_06]: They are saying that we need interest, we need participation from fans, or this game could be axed at any second.

1439
01:50:41,500 --> 01:50:44,861
[SPEAKER_06]: For some reason, I'm just reminded of when Tinkerbell is dying.

1440
01:50:45,141 --> 01:50:45,522
[SPEAKER_06]: Clap.

1441
01:50:45,742 --> 01:50:46,842
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to save me, just clap.

1442
01:50:47,102 --> 01:50:47,762
[SPEAKER_06]: Clap louder.

1443
01:50:48,043 --> 01:50:49,823
[SPEAKER_06]: Clap louder and say, I believe in fairies.

1444
01:50:49,983 --> 01:50:50,824
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe in fairies.

1445
01:50:50,884 --> 01:50:52,584
[SPEAKER_06]: That's literally what Capcom is saying.

1446
01:50:52,604 --> 01:50:53,245
[SPEAKER_06]: You need to clap.

1447
01:50:54,125 --> 01:50:55,666
[SPEAKER_06]: and say, I believe in Mega Man!

1448
01:50:55,966 --> 01:50:57,027
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe in Mega Man!

1449
01:50:57,087 --> 01:50:57,847
[SPEAKER_06]: And then give us your money.

1450
01:50:58,287 --> 01:50:59,228
[SPEAKER_06]: Is basically what they're saying.

1451
01:50:59,588 --> 01:51:14,297
[SPEAKER_06]: So they have come out and said in a blog post on Capcom Unity, Masakazu Iguchi, the director of the game, said the prototype version that's coming out on the 3DS is based on the prototype that they made to prove to Capcom that the game could happen.

1452
01:51:14,837 --> 01:51:20,220
[SPEAKER_06]: The heat and excitement surrounding this downloadable title would determine whether or not the full game could be greenlit.

1453
01:51:20,660 --> 01:51:22,802
[SPEAKER_06]: If hype is strong, the full title will be a go."

1454
01:51:23,442 --> 01:51:24,803
[SPEAKER_06]: If not, it's a no-go.

1455
01:51:36,114 --> 01:51:37,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, bunch of surf bots.

1456
01:51:39,216 --> 01:51:45,639
[SPEAKER_09]: If you want Legends 3, if this thing costs money and it's basically a glorified beta, that's kind of lame.

1457
01:51:45,800 --> 01:51:46,680
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, pick it up.

1458
01:51:47,821 --> 01:51:50,422
[SPEAKER_09]: They're tracking heavily the response to this, so get it.

1459
01:51:50,442 --> 01:51:53,744
[SPEAKER_06]: So now not only do we have pay to unlock content, but we have pay demos.

1460
01:51:54,865 --> 01:51:55,925
[SPEAKER_09]: Pay to finish developing.

1461
01:51:58,905 --> 01:52:27,717
[SPEAKER_06]: you want us to fix those clipping issues or you know the game crashes if you try to walk backwards you know just slip a little like a 20 we'll figure it out alright well I guess to be fair the Gran Turismo 5 prologue was kind of the same thing it kind of sounds like where this is going except we always knew there would be a Gran Turismo 5 eventually although was Bobby ever convinced that Gran Turismo 5 came out I'm not sure hopefully he's in chat and can let us know

1462
01:52:28,297 --> 01:52:28,718
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

1463
01:52:45,117 --> 01:52:45,838
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching!

1464
01:53:08,594 --> 01:53:37,672
[SPEAKER_06]: uh now apparently they were kind of asked well didn't you like try to get this cleared with Sega or what's going on uh Bomberlink who's the project leader on the progress said they did contact Sega uh I would like to say this is a quote from him I would like to say that we did actually contact Sega last year through an email message regarding the use of copyrighted material to which they answered asking us to send a formal letter to their legal department so that's what we did we accepted the ESA policies regarding the DMCA as well otherwise this website would not exist anymore so

1465
01:53:38,192 --> 01:53:38,632
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

1466
01:53:39,653 --> 01:53:41,333
[SPEAKER_06]: They had to take it down because Sega didn't like it.

1467
01:53:42,254 --> 01:53:43,674
[SPEAKER_06]: Eight years that thing was in the making.

1468
01:53:43,854 --> 01:53:48,776
[SPEAKER_06]: And Sega is just trying to really utilize that Streets of Rage license right now.

1469
01:53:48,936 --> 01:53:50,057
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a big IP for them.

1470
01:53:50,077 --> 01:53:58,520
[SPEAKER_09]: A part of trademark law is you have to pursue every infraction against your brand even if you're not doing anything with it.

1471
01:53:58,920 --> 01:54:01,642
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1472
01:54:23,877 --> 01:54:29,762
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, this is unfortunate to hear because the community obviously really cares about it and have to take eight years to put this out.

1473
01:54:30,282 --> 01:54:33,765
[SPEAKER_09]: But the fact that they were C&D is sort of, I don't know, seems like a duh.

1474
01:54:35,646 --> 01:54:38,848
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we mention about the whole Sega building in San Francisco now belongs to Zynga?

1475
01:54:38,868 --> 01:54:39,549
[SPEAKER_06]: To Zynga, yeah.

1476
01:54:39,569 --> 01:54:40,750
[SPEAKER_06]: We did bring that up on the show, huh?

1477
01:54:41,090 --> 01:54:45,033
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking of sad stories, sad, sad stories.

1478
01:54:45,053 --> 01:54:45,974
[SPEAKER_02]: We need a sad trombone, Rob.

1479
01:54:46,414 --> 01:54:49,336
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't know Zynga owned Words With Friends now either.

1480
01:54:50,197 --> 01:54:51,058
[SPEAKER_02]: Zynga's the...

1481
01:54:51,778 --> 01:54:53,098
[SPEAKER_06]: I stopped playing Words with Friends.

1482
01:54:53,138 --> 01:54:53,538
[SPEAKER_06]: You know why?

1483
01:54:53,558 --> 01:54:56,179
[SPEAKER_06]: Because everybody wants to fucking play Words with Friends.

1484
01:54:56,239 --> 01:54:58,680
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it's like my phone keeps going off every two seconds.

1485
01:54:59,360 --> 01:55:01,600
[SPEAKER_06]: Your move with DarkSakura.

1486
01:55:01,660 --> 01:55:03,081
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't play.

1487
01:55:03,421 --> 01:55:05,081
[SPEAKER_09]: Random people you didn't know, right?

1488
01:55:05,101 --> 01:55:06,342
[SPEAKER_09]: We're trying to start new games with you.

1489
01:55:06,362 --> 01:55:07,202
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that shit happens too.

1490
01:55:07,622 --> 01:55:08,642
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck Words with Friends.

1491
01:55:08,922 --> 01:55:09,742
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a terrible game.

1492
01:55:10,403 --> 01:55:11,043
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I said it.

1493
01:55:13,450 --> 01:55:14,611
[SPEAKER_06]: I love Scrabble That's not a word!

1494
01:55:30,077 --> 01:55:35,799
[SPEAKER_06]: You can actually take a screenshot of the screen from Words With Friends and then like upload it to this other app and it just cheats.

1495
01:55:36,060 --> 01:55:36,700
[SPEAKER_06]: Tells you the best word.

1496
01:55:36,720 --> 01:55:49,385
[SPEAKER_09]: When I was playing a lot of Yahoo Literati, I would, there was a JavaScript website that was in Anagram Finder where you would put in your Yahoo Literati URL and it would say, oh, here's your word.

1497
01:55:50,105 --> 01:55:51,126
[SPEAKER_09]: You're a cheater.

1498
01:55:51,146 --> 01:55:51,586
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1499
01:55:52,166 --> 01:55:53,547
[SPEAKER_06]: You are a cheater?

1500
01:55:54,067 --> 01:55:56,028
[SPEAKER_06]: You cheated on Yahoo Literati?

1501
01:55:56,128 --> 01:55:56,368
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1502
01:55:56,568 --> 01:55:57,629
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to hell.

1503
01:55:58,029 --> 01:55:58,329
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

1504
01:55:59,269 --> 01:56:02,210
[SPEAKER_02]: I can, however, say that I have not cheated at Scrabulous.

1505
01:56:04,311 --> 01:56:05,231
[SPEAKER_02]: I miss Scrabulous.

1506
01:56:05,311 --> 01:56:06,211
[SPEAKER_02]: What's Scrabulous?

1507
01:56:06,891 --> 01:56:10,752
[SPEAKER_02]: Scrabulous became Lexulous because Scrabble or whatever.

1508
01:56:10,772 --> 01:56:11,733
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that on Facebook?

1509
01:56:12,153 --> 01:56:12,513
[SPEAKER_02]: It is now.

1510
01:56:12,613 --> 01:56:13,673
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah, fuck that game too.

1511
01:56:14,113 --> 01:56:18,775
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't play it on Facebook, but I used to play it when it was Scrabulous and it had Scrabble Solitaire.

1512
01:56:19,535 --> 01:56:23,376
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it's like, it makes you play with people and I hate that because Scrabble Solitaire is super fun.

1513
01:56:24,256 --> 01:56:27,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Where basically you just play until you're out of words and build up your score.

1514
01:56:27,799 --> 01:56:29,704
[SPEAKER_06]: Are there any fun Facebook games right now?

1515
01:56:29,784 --> 01:56:31,228
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I know that's kind of an oxymoron.

1516
01:56:31,328 --> 01:56:33,634
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been going in and deleting just about all of my apps.

1517
01:56:34,373 --> 01:56:36,194
[SPEAKER_06]: There's seriously nothing I play on Facebook.

1518
01:56:36,214 --> 01:56:37,294
[SPEAKER_06]: I got sick of Knights of the Clique.

1519
01:56:37,314 --> 01:56:42,396
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure I have like four trillion blood points in Vampire Wars that I haven't touched in three years.

1520
01:56:42,996 --> 01:56:45,136
[SPEAKER_09]: Knights of the Clique haven't touched in two and a half, three months.

1521
01:56:46,077 --> 01:56:46,637
[SPEAKER_02]: I deleted it.

1522
01:56:46,997 --> 01:56:48,397
[SPEAKER_02]: I deleted almost all of my games.

1523
01:56:48,898 --> 01:56:50,078
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to play the Civ game.

1524
01:56:50,118 --> 01:56:51,338
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the only thing I was interested in.

1525
01:56:51,678 --> 01:56:52,299
[SPEAKER_09]: Did that come out?

1526
01:56:52,499 --> 01:56:53,059
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't even remember.

1527
01:56:53,079 --> 01:56:54,939
[SPEAKER_06]: It was in Alpha for a long time.

1528
01:56:55,460 --> 01:57:02,862
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there's supposedly, and it's a story that didn't make our show roll tonight, but some music game is out on Facebook too that I need to check out for next week.

1529
01:57:03,602 --> 01:57:23,167
[SPEAKER_06]: something that was posted in our thread about like a Facebook game but I wanted to actually play it before bringing it up on the show but apparently there's that too so all right uh Kassan in our chat room says Scrabulous sounds like a Decepticon name I like that all right let's move on uh DarkSakura what do you got for us

1530
01:57:24,945 --> 01:57:30,892
[SPEAKER_02]: There is an Activision memo that was linked that says there is no appetite for Guitar Hero.

1531
01:57:32,073 --> 01:57:36,839
[SPEAKER_02]: But there is an appetite for Destruction.

1532
01:57:38,126 --> 01:57:41,528
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's also an aperitif for destruction, if you like.

1533
01:57:41,948 --> 01:57:42,868
[SPEAKER_02]: Lounge against the machine.

1534
01:57:44,549 --> 01:57:44,849
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

1535
01:57:46,090 --> 01:57:53,953
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, the whole thing is that they're saying is that, yeah, right now it's dead, but it should eventually come back up.

1536
01:57:53,993 --> 01:57:54,313
[SPEAKER_02]: They're asking...

1537
01:57:56,834 --> 01:58:04,237
[SPEAKER_02]: The CEO, Eric Hirschberg, said, why are we walking away from Guitar Hero instead of just trying to reinvent it?

1538
01:58:04,797 --> 01:58:11,079
[SPEAKER_02]: And that basically it's because there are so many high-quality games that are just saturating the market.

1539
01:58:11,159 --> 01:58:13,660
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't this what we were saying before?

1540
01:58:13,780 --> 01:58:15,240
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it the market was just way too saturated?

1541
01:58:16,061 --> 01:58:18,281
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they're like, oh, duh.

1542
01:58:18,722 --> 01:58:19,842
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we were doing wrong.

1543
01:58:20,642 --> 01:58:21,122
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

1544
01:58:23,543 --> 01:58:43,152
[SPEAKER_02]: they're sort of setting it aside for now in fact it actually says that they are quote perhaps after a cooling period we will revisit the franchise with fresh innovation they're gonna wait for people to go remember when Guitar Hero was cool and then Activision will be right there to say hey we still own the rights to this hey there's a whole new Guitar Hero game for you to play haha

1545
01:58:43,931 --> 01:58:45,332
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Retro Guitar Hero.

1546
01:58:46,953 --> 01:58:49,294
[SPEAKER_02]: Meanwhile, Rock Band's like, we've been out here and we're still cool.

1547
01:58:49,514 --> 01:58:49,834
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.

1548
01:58:50,195 --> 01:58:50,795
[SPEAKER_02]: We're still cool.

1549
01:58:51,215 --> 01:58:51,495
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.

1550
01:58:52,036 --> 01:58:52,656
[SPEAKER_02]: We're really cool.

1551
01:58:54,377 --> 01:58:56,658
[SPEAKER_02]: We've attached the clarinet attachment.

1552
01:58:57,019 --> 01:59:00,581
[SPEAKER_06]: Although I do, I even feel like the Rock Band thing has really died down.

1553
01:59:00,641 --> 01:59:02,241
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, it's really died down.

1554
01:59:03,102 --> 01:59:03,722
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of sad.

1555
01:59:03,822 --> 01:59:05,143
[SPEAKER_02]: We were just playing the other day.

1556
01:59:05,483 --> 01:59:05,804
[SPEAKER_06]: Were you?

1557
01:59:06,064 --> 01:59:06,324
Yeah.

1558
01:59:07,768 --> 01:59:09,329
[SPEAKER_02]: The cousins were over when we were playing.

1559
01:59:09,929 --> 01:59:13,750
[SPEAKER_06]: SSJ100 Matt in our chatroom says, Notice how no one ever asked these questions when DDR died.

1560
01:59:14,010 --> 01:59:14,870
[SPEAKER_06]: In Konami, that is.

1561
01:59:15,330 --> 01:59:18,351
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, technically DDR is still not dead.

1562
01:59:18,551 --> 01:59:20,252
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they are still cranking out those games.

1563
01:59:21,012 --> 01:59:21,772
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, wow.

1564
01:59:22,132 --> 01:59:23,893
[SPEAKER_06]: There's Xbox 360 one coming out.

1565
01:59:24,133 --> 01:59:25,773
[SPEAKER_06]: The port of the PlayStation 3 one.

1566
01:59:26,173 --> 01:59:27,434
[SPEAKER_06]: It's coming on the Xbox 360.

1567
01:59:27,534 --> 01:59:30,595
[SPEAKER_06]: And you guys, it uses the Xbox Live Vision camera.

1568
01:59:30,995 --> 01:59:31,755
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how hip.

1569
01:59:32,415 --> 01:59:34,076
[SPEAKER_06]: Konami is to the modern technologies.

1570
01:59:34,116 --> 01:59:35,016
[SPEAKER_06]: The little webcam.

1571
01:59:35,056 --> 01:59:36,237
[SPEAKER_06]: Not the Kinect, but the little.

1572
01:59:36,257 --> 01:59:37,438
[SPEAKER_06]: Not the Kinect, but the little webcam.

1573
01:59:37,558 --> 01:59:38,638
[SPEAKER_06]: AOL looking thing.

1574
01:59:38,658 --> 01:59:39,819
[SPEAKER_06]: And we use that, apparently.

1575
01:59:40,259 --> 01:59:45,382
[SPEAKER_06]: Which I am, I hope to God for Konami's sake, the Kinect will stand in for that.

1576
01:59:45,882 --> 01:59:48,083
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, you know, because the Kinect's basically a camera too, but.

1577
01:59:48,584 --> 01:59:54,047
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I think the 360 only has the one IO USB port in the back for goodies.

1578
01:59:54,507 --> 01:59:57,108
[SPEAKER_09]: So you'd have to unplug your Kinect to plug in the little webcam.

1579
01:59:57,468 --> 01:59:58,169
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not going to happen.

1580
01:59:58,189 --> 01:59:58,729
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not going to happen.

1581
02:00:00,106 --> 02:00:01,748
[SPEAKER_06]: It's next to Walt Disney's head

1582
02:00:21,989 --> 02:00:22,289
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

1583
02:00:23,529 --> 02:00:23,890
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving on.

1584
02:00:23,930 --> 02:00:24,550
[SPEAKER_09]: Salacious Pop.

1585
02:00:25,550 --> 02:00:33,913
[SPEAKER_09]: There was a story that we reported on a few weeks ago about ratings tampering on the indie marketplace on the XBLA.

1586
02:00:34,253 --> 02:00:34,413
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1587
02:00:34,873 --> 02:00:45,456
[SPEAKER_09]: And some indie games that had anywhere from three to five star reviews were getting hundreds of one star reviews within a short amount of time that was throwing their

1588
02:00:45,976 --> 02:00:54,164
[SPEAKER_09]: review their game listing and the rankings down in the toilet so they weren't getting as much exposure as they would otherwise if they had their four-star review.

1589
02:00:55,065 --> 02:01:09,178
[SPEAKER_09]: So Microsoft decided to come up with a fix to this, and they have decided that in order to rate a indie game, you need to have a gold account, which means you are paying Microsoft money.

1590
02:01:09,438 --> 02:01:11,859
[SPEAKER_09]: for the Xbox Gold Live services.

1591
02:01:11,939 --> 02:01:19,041
[SPEAKER_09]: If you are a free or silver member, you cannot give a rating to an indie game.

1592
02:01:19,221 --> 02:01:22,982
[SPEAKER_06]: That's good, because it was probably a bunch of sock-free accounts that were doing this anyway.

1593
02:01:23,362 --> 02:01:35,106
[SPEAKER_09]: This story that I looked up also references a previous story when the manipulation was first discovered about a firm that had posted to a contractor

1594
02:01:37,006 --> 02:01:44,713
[SPEAKER_09]: Job site basically saying we need someone that can write a script that will generate 5,000 free silver accounts.

1595
02:01:44,833 --> 02:01:49,256
[SPEAKER_09]: They were looking for a coder that's like, can we run this overnight and just get the username spit out to us?

1596
02:01:49,757 --> 02:01:58,104
[SPEAKER_09]: Doesn't necessarily say why they wanted those 5,000 accounts or if it's even related to this rating manipulation.

1597
02:01:58,224 --> 02:02:02,247
[SPEAKER_09]: But just as a coincidence, there are firms out there that are like, we want...

1598
02:02:03,288 --> 02:02:09,053
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, if I was Microsoft, I would be fucking bringing the smackdown on these firms for abusing their network.

1599
02:02:09,093 --> 02:02:15,819
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I guess it was a graphic design firm contract script for 5,000 Xbox Live Silver accounts.

1600
02:02:16,339 --> 02:02:24,066
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, don't know for sure, but the fact that the interest for that is there, Microsoft's like, if you have a free account, you don't get to rate on indie games.

1601
02:02:24,966 --> 02:02:26,047
[SPEAKER_06]: Which I guess makes sense.

1602
02:02:26,067 --> 02:02:33,372
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, that sucks that you have to pay, but I mean, it will... If you're online, or if you have a gold account, they can take action against you.

1603
02:02:33,432 --> 02:02:35,294
[SPEAKER_09]: They can ban your credit card.

1604
02:02:35,314 --> 02:02:36,355
[SPEAKER_09]: They could ban your account.

1605
02:02:36,695 --> 02:02:37,816
[SPEAKER_09]: You lose your gamer tag.

1606
02:02:37,856 --> 02:02:39,117
[SPEAKER_09]: You lose your achievement points.

1607
02:02:39,528 --> 02:02:43,589
[SPEAKER_06]: Why didn't they just make it so you have to actually play the game for 10 minutes to rate?

1608
02:02:43,830 --> 02:02:45,370
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, is that so hard?

1609
02:02:45,950 --> 02:02:46,310
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1610
02:02:47,151 --> 02:02:47,971
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess that's hard to do.

1611
02:02:48,251 --> 02:02:51,132
[SPEAKER_06]: It's easy to build something to shut it off after four minutes.

1612
02:02:51,232 --> 02:02:53,693
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, demo over four minutes, clank, buy, or get out.

1613
02:02:53,733 --> 02:02:58,155
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you buy indie games a la carte with a silver, or do you need gold in order to even buy stuff?

1614
02:02:58,275 --> 02:03:00,075
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe you can buy them a la carte with silver.

1615
02:03:00,396 --> 02:03:00,616
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1616
02:03:00,776 --> 02:03:00,996
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1617
02:03:01,296 --> 02:03:02,196
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't see why they would shut it.

1618
02:03:02,236 --> 02:03:02,616
[SPEAKER_06]: It's money.

1619
02:03:03,096 --> 02:03:04,397
[SPEAKER_06]: Why would you shut off a moneymaker?

1620
02:03:05,816 --> 02:03:06,377
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm pretty sure.

1621
02:03:08,620 --> 02:03:11,483
[SPEAKER_06]: And Randy in our chatroom at chat.orange.radio.com agrees with me.

1622
02:03:11,884 --> 02:03:15,108
[SPEAKER_06]: They should make it so that you have to actually play a game for a set amount of time to rate it.

1623
02:03:15,388 --> 02:03:17,391
[SPEAKER_06]: That way people have to go out of their way to be jerks.

1624
02:03:17,768 --> 02:03:46,445
[SPEAKER_09]: at the same time though what's to stop somebody from building a script that signs in 5,000 Xbox Live users into a game I mean it's possible a botting thing could do it sad but true somebody would figure it out yeah I I agree that you should be able to have to play the game before you can rate it but at the same time if I play a demo that is so bad and I want to be able to warn people that this demo was horrible

1625
02:03:47,305 --> 02:03:49,007
[SPEAKER_06]: Like that Maids with Balloons?

1626
02:03:49,087 --> 02:03:50,088
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1627
02:03:50,288 --> 02:03:52,890
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not going to pay the 300 space bucks.

1628
02:03:53,631 --> 02:03:59,596
[SPEAKER_06]: I think people should download Maids with Balloons just to see how freaking bad it is.

1629
02:04:00,778 --> 02:04:02,359
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what Maids with Balloons reminds me of?

1630
02:04:02,739 --> 02:04:06,082
[SPEAKER_06]: An old CD-ROM game from when that technology first came out.

1631
02:04:06,403 --> 02:04:10,166
[SPEAKER_06]: And people were like, let's put softcore porn out and try to make a game out of it.

1632
02:04:11,648 --> 02:04:19,627
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm thinking of the slumber party game that that one girl was in from the Night Trap Yeah, it's like that Exactly

1633
02:04:21,337 --> 02:04:21,917
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, anyhow.

1634
02:04:22,737 --> 02:04:30,119
[SPEAKER_06]: Moving on to one other story, and I've kind of brought this up before, so this is a bit of a duh, but Super Mario 3DS, of course it is going to be announced at E3.

1635
02:04:30,359 --> 02:04:37,240
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I mean, I guess it was announced, quote-unquote, at Game Developers Conference, but we're going to get the official details, I guess you could say, at E3.

1636
02:04:37,720 --> 02:04:42,321
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently, though, according to an interview with Edge, Miyamoto has leaked out a few details on this.

1637
02:04:42,721 --> 02:04:48,962
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to have a combination of Super Mario Galaxy and Super Mario 64, but it's also completely original.

1638
02:04:49,702 --> 02:05:13,959
[SPEAKER_06]: so even though it's a combination of these two games it's still completely original perhaps that's because of the Tanooki or the raccoon suit which we haven't seen in any of those other games that could be part of it as well or maybe it'll just be kind of a mechanic about the story of the game or how it all kind of plays together maybe instead of I would like to see this in a Mario game maybe I'm just maybe a pipe dream but a bump but instead of all these broken up worlds what about one massive world

1639
02:05:14,759 --> 02:05:15,360
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1640
02:05:34,981 --> 02:05:35,261
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

1641
02:05:35,961 --> 02:05:38,282
[SPEAKER_06]: Just like any good Metroidvania type of game.

1642
02:05:38,522 --> 02:05:40,082
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to get an item to get behind the door.

1643
02:05:40,582 --> 02:05:41,982
[SPEAKER_06]: I would like to see that in a Mario game.

1644
02:05:42,102 --> 02:05:43,122
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be pretty awesome.

1645
02:05:43,222 --> 02:05:44,043
[SPEAKER_06]: Be very awesome.

1646
02:05:44,263 --> 02:05:44,903
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see what happens.

1647
02:05:45,363 --> 02:05:45,743
[SPEAKER_06]: Alrighty.

1648
02:05:47,223 --> 02:05:47,663
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

1649
02:05:48,203 --> 02:05:49,123
[SPEAKER_06]: Redertainment in our chatroom.

1650
02:05:49,143 --> 02:05:50,144
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to read this comment too.

1651
02:05:50,204 --> 02:05:51,784
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking of the whole demos and downranking.

1652
02:05:52,364 --> 02:05:54,624
[SPEAKER_06]: Chat.OrangeSoundsRadio.com is of course where our chatroom is.

1653
02:05:54,704 --> 02:06:03,306
[SPEAKER_06]: Redertainment says, if you want to warn people that a demo sucks, I'm sure you have a Twitter account you can bitch on that reaches more people than that downloaded that indie title.

1654
02:06:03,846 --> 02:06:04,066
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.

1655
02:06:05,126 --> 02:06:08,707
[SPEAKER_06]: and Randy says that Grand Theft Mario reminds him of something that happened in Robot Chicken.

1656
02:06:10,108 --> 02:06:13,489
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't seen every episode of Robot Chicken so I guess that went over my head.

1657
02:06:13,649 --> 02:06:13,929
[SPEAKER_06]: Oops.

1658
02:06:14,549 --> 02:06:16,630
[SPEAKER_06]: I did see the Final Fantasy 7 fast food.

1659
02:06:16,930 --> 02:06:17,810
[SPEAKER_06]: That was great.

1660
02:06:17,890 --> 02:06:18,750
[SPEAKER_06]: That I did see.

1661
02:06:19,270 --> 02:06:20,591
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's get to the emails.

1662
02:06:20,771 --> 02:06:29,674
[SPEAKER_06]: Every week you guys send us emails at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com The mailbag's been rather thin the past few weeks so I'm really happy that this week you guys have fucking blown it up.

1663
02:06:29,994 --> 02:06:30,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay!

1664
02:06:31,874 --> 02:06:33,378
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura is going to work tonight.

1665
02:06:33,860 --> 02:06:35,825
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we got a request from...

1666
02:06:38,323 --> 02:06:41,645
[SPEAKER_02]: Ronnie for an autograph with an address.

1667
02:06:41,665 --> 02:06:48,749
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a five-year listener, so I figured I was going to find a postcard that I have, and we could just sign it and then put it in an envelope and send it.

1668
02:06:48,769 --> 02:06:50,049
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have one that says Juicyful.

1669
02:06:50,590 --> 02:06:51,290
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's orange.

1670
02:06:51,530 --> 02:06:51,990
[SPEAKER_02]: It's orange.

1671
02:06:52,070 --> 02:06:52,511
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an orange.

1672
02:06:52,691 --> 02:07:00,335
[SPEAKER_02]: Either that or I was going to use a congratulations on your bar mitzvah card that I got at the dollar store for any upcoming bar mitzvah.

1673
02:07:00,535 --> 02:07:00,835
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1674
02:07:00,855 --> 02:07:02,536
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there's a lot of kids.

1675
02:07:03,437 --> 02:07:05,798
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, no, I better save that for an actual bar mitzvah, so...

1676
02:07:06,710 --> 02:07:09,813
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, I set this aside, and we'll get everyone to sign it.

1677
02:07:09,853 --> 02:07:11,074
[SPEAKER_06]: We gotta get Loki here, though.

1678
02:07:11,134 --> 02:07:19,160
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, Salacious Pop, I'm sure, would not, or his autograph would not go unappreciated, but I'm sure somebody wants a complete trifecta of official OLR hosts.

1679
02:07:19,801 --> 02:07:20,081
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1680
02:07:20,621 --> 02:07:24,064
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I just need to make sure that I mark the right one.

1681
02:07:24,124 --> 02:07:25,005
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, don't click delete.

1682
02:07:25,966 --> 02:07:27,187
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not deleting it.

1683
02:07:28,127 --> 02:07:31,590
[SPEAKER_02]: There, it's this one, so I will do unread.

1684
02:07:31,830 --> 02:07:32,271
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.

1685
02:07:33,231 --> 02:07:34,833
[SPEAKER_02]: And, moving forward, um...

1686
02:07:36,482 --> 02:07:43,291
[SPEAKER_02]: This is from Holly D. Hey guys, I could swear your email was the above, but I recently heard you say mailbag at originalsradio.com.

1687
02:07:44,453 --> 02:07:47,177
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the Gmail one an old email or something?

1688
02:07:47,477 --> 02:07:47,837
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1689
02:07:48,058 --> 02:07:48,979
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have a Gmail at all?

1690
02:07:48,999 --> 02:07:49,940
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we have a Gmail?

1691
02:07:50,040 --> 02:07:51,242
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that we do.

1692
02:07:51,422 --> 02:07:53,405
[SPEAKER_09]: What's the sender's name?

1693
02:07:54,434 --> 02:07:54,754
[SPEAKER_09]: Holly.

1694
02:07:55,315 --> 02:07:56,636
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that the Holly that writes into Horde House?

1695
02:07:56,836 --> 02:07:58,377
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it's probably the same Holly from Horde House.

1696
02:07:58,977 --> 02:07:59,878
[SPEAKER_06]: That is a Gmail account.

1697
02:07:59,898 --> 02:08:01,159
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that is a Gmail account.

1698
02:08:01,539 --> 02:08:06,423
[SPEAKER_06]: The email for Horde House is HordeHousePodcast at Gmail.com.

1699
02:08:06,683 --> 02:08:09,885
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, Orange Lounge Radio is Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

1700
02:08:10,165 --> 02:08:13,167
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to see if maybe somebody's swiped it.

1701
02:08:13,187 --> 02:08:13,488
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1702
02:08:13,528 --> 02:08:13,788
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me look.

1703
02:08:14,740 --> 02:08:19,722
[SPEAKER_02]: Anywho, just wanted to confirm because I sent a couple emails and I thought it was weird that Sakura kept saying you only had one or two emails.

1704
02:08:20,123 --> 02:08:21,763
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe other people are confused like me.

1705
02:08:22,624 --> 02:08:22,904
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.

1706
02:08:23,764 --> 02:08:28,647
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's... You sent it to the right one now, so it's mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

1707
02:08:32,592 --> 02:08:34,394
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, OLR crew, ACHP here.

1708
02:08:34,554 --> 02:08:43,701
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if anyone at OLR has played the PS2 game Shin Megami Tensei Persona 4, but I wanted to share the gaming-related project that I've decided to take upon myself.

1709
02:08:44,141 --> 02:08:47,744
[SPEAKER_02]: Persona 4 takes place in the year 2011, from April 11th through the rest of the year.

1710
02:08:48,184 --> 02:08:52,788
[SPEAKER_02]: That being the case, I've taken it upon myself to tweet the events of Persona 4 roughly as they happen.

1711
02:08:53,428 --> 02:08:59,190
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just very deep game with lots of relationships, drama, mystery, and just lots of things to do in general.

1712
02:08:59,230 --> 02:09:03,031
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll try to make it as interesting and funny to follow along with as possible.

1713
02:09:03,371 --> 02:09:06,012
[SPEAKER_02]: The Twitter account is at NarukamiYu.

1714
02:09:06,472 --> 02:09:10,253
[SPEAKER_02]: That's N-A-R-U-K-M-I-Y-U.

1715
02:09:10,793 --> 02:09:14,334
[SPEAKER_02]: NarukamiYu being the name of... Let me start over.

1716
02:09:14,434 --> 02:09:21,516
[SPEAKER_02]: NarukamiYu being the name that the people developing the new persona for anime have given the originally nameless main character.

1717
02:09:22,316 --> 02:09:29,918
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not looking to become some sort of D-list-y celebrity by doing this, but I do want people who would be appreciated in this sort of project to know about it.

1718
02:09:30,479 --> 02:09:33,079
[SPEAKER_02]: If you would spread the word on your show, I would be deeply honored.

1719
02:09:33,219 --> 02:09:35,460
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, the Twitter account is at NarukamiU.

1720
02:09:36,740 --> 02:09:38,021
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, happy birthday, DarkSakura.

1721
02:09:38,141 --> 02:09:38,581
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1722
02:09:38,941 --> 02:09:43,522
[SPEAKER_02]: Your birthday is just a few days before mine, and mine is the day before Wendell's, so yours was yesterday.

1723
02:09:43,782 --> 02:09:44,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, happy birthday.

1724
02:09:45,723 --> 02:09:49,044
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep up the great work and thanks so much for helping me spread the word AZHP.

1725
02:09:49,144 --> 02:09:51,505
[SPEAKER_02]: And also a very big happy birthday to Mr. Wendell.

1726
02:09:51,585 --> 02:09:52,926
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for reminding me to say so.

1727
02:09:52,986 --> 02:09:54,766
[SPEAKER_02]: Because Wendell is one of our old school buddies.

1728
02:09:55,687 --> 02:09:57,087
[SPEAKER_06]: Happy birthday, all y'all.

1729
02:09:57,547 --> 02:09:59,288
[SPEAKER_06]: And glad you got that plug worked out.

1730
02:09:59,368 --> 02:09:59,988
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, he's old.

1731
02:10:00,148 --> 02:10:00,888
[SPEAKER_06]: He emails us a lot.

1732
02:10:01,269 --> 02:10:02,189
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to follow up.

1733
02:10:02,689 --> 02:10:06,350
[SPEAKER_06]: It does look like there is an Orange Lounge Radio email account at Gmail.

1734
02:10:06,550 --> 02:10:07,231
[SPEAKER_06]: It is not us.

1735
02:10:07,571 --> 02:10:10,892
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, well, I sent a password reset thing.

1736
02:10:11,292 --> 02:10:32,547
[SPEAKER_06]: so if it is one of us we'll get the email but it's not in my email it's not in my orange launch radio it's not the mailbag email so somebody else could have signed up trying to impersonate us i've certainly suppose that's possible uh loki could have it too i he might have done that for the youtube channel or something that's very possible uh so one of us will have the reset email if it's ours but as far as we know right now we don't own it so

1737
02:10:32,927 --> 02:10:37,009
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got about six different emails and none of them are... And we don't write from that address.

1738
02:10:37,189 --> 02:10:45,793
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you do get something from OrangeLaunchRadio at gmail.com, forward it to the official email of OrangeLaunchRadio, which is mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com so we can investigate.

1739
02:10:46,313 --> 02:10:51,315
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and other than that, we're probably going to have to send a notice for them to strike it.

1740
02:10:52,075 --> 02:10:53,016
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it could be Loki.

1741
02:10:53,156 --> 02:10:56,137
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki could have done with the YouTube channel, so we'll have to ask him next week.

1742
02:10:56,577 --> 02:10:57,338
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for letting us know.

1743
02:10:58,559 --> 02:10:59,459
[SPEAKER_02]: Greetings, OLR.

1744
02:10:59,519 --> 02:11:01,300
[SPEAKER_02]: This week was torture without your podcast.

1745
02:11:01,341 --> 02:11:02,982
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't ever take another week off again.

1746
02:11:03,142 --> 02:11:08,225
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if Rob and Jamie have to go somewhere, I'll suck it up and just listen to Loki eat chicken and complain about Nintendo for three hours.

1747
02:11:09,026 --> 02:11:10,247
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is exactly what it would be.

1748
02:11:10,487 --> 02:11:12,088
[SPEAKER_02]: Peace and chicken grease, Serious Turtle.

1749
02:11:13,629 --> 02:11:14,730
[SPEAKER_06]: He's a very serious turtle.

1750
02:11:15,070 --> 02:11:16,111
[SPEAKER_06]: Like seriously, you're not allowed to leave.

1751
02:11:19,292 --> 02:11:23,473
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to point out a lot of your favorite shows take all summer off.

1752
02:11:24,613 --> 02:11:27,494
[SPEAKER_06]: We take one week off every three months or so.

1753
02:11:27,514 --> 02:11:29,194
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's okay if we miss four shows a year.

1754
02:11:29,954 --> 02:11:31,755
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we need a vacation sometimes.

1755
02:11:31,895 --> 02:11:32,275
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

1756
02:11:33,435 --> 02:11:35,156
[SPEAKER_06]: It felt really good to not have a show last week.

1757
02:11:36,096 --> 02:11:40,817
[SPEAKER_06]: I love doing the show, don't get me wrong, but it was kind of nice to have Sunday night to do something else.

1758
02:11:41,397 --> 02:11:56,393
[SPEAKER_02]: well now usually when I take Sunday off if it's you know not for family stuff it's for doing something else for the show I've gone to gaming conventions and stuff called in and reported on it and sometimes honestly I wish I was here instead of there but you know

1759
02:11:58,058 --> 02:11:59,079
[SPEAKER_02]: because this is my house.

1760
02:11:59,539 --> 02:11:59,739
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1761
02:12:00,399 --> 02:12:01,059
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, OLR.

1762
02:12:01,099 --> 02:12:02,399
[SPEAKER_02]: This is from Spazinator, by the way.

1763
02:12:02,920 --> 02:12:10,722
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty sure that the three of you have covered the story about PSN going down this week due to hackers in Part A of this week's show, so I won't bother rehashing the details.

1764
02:12:10,862 --> 02:12:13,623
[SPEAKER_02]: Rather, I'd like to do a Loki-style rant about it, if I may.

1765
02:12:14,243 --> 02:12:18,724
[SPEAKER_02]: While I'm not pissed at Sony, hell, from what I can tell, they did what they needed to do.

1766
02:12:18,904 --> 02:12:20,165
[SPEAKER_02]: I am, however, extremely pissed off.

1767
02:12:20,405 --> 02:12:22,425
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, dude, it's not hackers, okay?

1768
02:12:22,626 --> 02:12:24,046
[SPEAKER_02]: But I will read your rant anyway.

1769
02:12:24,867 --> 02:12:29,769
[SPEAKER_02]: I am, however, extremely pissed off at these fucktards that hacked PSN.

1770
02:12:30,629 --> 02:12:37,331
[SPEAKER_02]: Despite Sony not explicitly saying who it was that did it, I am 100,000% sure it was these anonymous dickwads that did it.

1771
02:12:37,892 --> 02:12:41,413
[SPEAKER_02]: After all, as the old saying goes, if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it must be a duck.

1772
02:12:41,473 --> 02:12:42,813
[SPEAKER_02]: Who the holy hell are they to do this?

1773
02:12:43,194 --> 02:12:44,214
[SPEAKER_02]: What the fuck gives them the right?

1774
02:12:45,413 --> 02:12:49,955
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know I, along with a small minority, have other consoles to play online with.

1775
02:12:50,376 --> 02:12:53,497
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, there are single-player games as well, but that's besides the point.

1776
02:12:53,937 --> 02:12:59,300
[SPEAKER_02]: There are games such as MAG, SOCOM, Confrontation Free Realms, DCUO, etc.

1777
02:12:59,760 --> 02:13:03,022
[SPEAKER_02]: that are multiplayer only, as well as a few Capcom titles, i.e.

1778
02:13:03,102 --> 02:13:08,405
[SPEAKER_02]: Final Fight Double Impact and Bionic Commando Rearm 2, that require one to be logged into PSN to play.

1779
02:13:08,585 --> 02:13:10,046
[SPEAKER_02]: Hence, right now, they're unplayable.

1780
02:13:10,686 --> 02:13:11,487
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1781
02:13:28,247 --> 02:13:40,795
[SPEAKER_02]: At any rate, when Sony finds these torps, and they will, it's just a matter of time, I hope they get the legal system on their punk asses like white on motherfucking rice, and as Samuel L. Jackson so eloquently put it, gets Medieval on their asses.

1782
02:13:41,235 --> 02:13:44,717
[SPEAKER_02]: May the hackers burn in a nuclear fire, then drown in an ocean of piss and acid.

1783
02:13:45,057 --> 02:13:45,938
[SPEAKER_02]: Slash end rant.

1784
02:13:47,759 --> 02:13:49,720
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually did exhales, but I exhaled.

1785
02:13:50,200 --> 02:13:54,683
[SPEAKER_02]: This rant is brought to you by one really pissed off PSN user that wants to lay the smackdown on some punks.

1786
02:13:55,263 --> 02:13:57,865
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, your anger may be a little misdirected.

1787
02:13:58,185 --> 02:14:00,406
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait until it's resolved and official word comes out.

1788
02:14:01,807 --> 02:14:03,588
[SPEAKER_06]: I kind of agree with what you're saying.

1789
02:14:03,608 --> 02:14:05,629
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I read this real quick from Bobby in our chat room too?

1790
02:14:06,029 --> 02:14:09,111
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, yeah, I kept telling him it wasn't anonymous and he told me I was wrong.

1791
02:14:09,151 --> 02:14:10,671
[SPEAKER_06]: He told me that it didn't matter what the truth was.

1792
02:14:10,711 --> 02:14:11,712
[SPEAKER_06]: He was going to blame Anon.

1793
02:14:13,051 --> 02:14:33,705
[SPEAKER_06]: Anon was very proud to take credit for that first Sony attack and that's the problem is that now that this is happening I mean this could be happening from somebody who's trying to get at Anonymous for all we know Anonymous flat out said we understand this tactic only hurts the people we're trying to protect we are not going to do it anymore

1794
02:14:34,625 --> 02:14:41,191
[SPEAKER_06]: But because Anonymous has no leader, you know, it's not like WikiLeaks who has that, whatever his name is.

1795
02:14:41,211 --> 02:14:44,974
[SPEAKER_06]: They've got a group that's... But there's no clear leader out there.

1796
02:14:45,034 --> 02:14:50,399
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's what's causing them to look bad is because it could be a subset that's doing it.

1797
02:14:51,200 --> 02:14:54,643
[SPEAKER_02]: Regardless, I don't think this is Anonymous.

1798
02:14:55,143 --> 02:14:57,465
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they may benefit from the notoriety.

1799
02:14:58,686 --> 02:15:00,407
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't think this is anonymous.

1800
02:15:01,207 --> 02:15:05,869
[SPEAKER_02]: They flat out said, no, this is counterproductive to what we're trying to do.

1801
02:15:06,889 --> 02:15:10,030
[SPEAKER_02]: So don't look for a scapegoat.

1802
02:15:10,050 --> 02:15:11,851
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait until they actually officially say what's going on.

1803
02:15:11,871 --> 02:15:24,615
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I have a feeling that it's actually one of those situations where, like, okay, at my work, we got an email out that said this number of people are affected because a laptop was stolen.

1804
02:15:25,956 --> 02:15:32,099
[SPEAKER_06]: Who hacked the site that does all the email campaigns?

1805
02:15:46,427 --> 02:15:59,599
[SPEAKER_06]: and all these websites that use this email service to maintain their mailing list and so forth had to write people because I got some from a couple companies saying your personal information may have been breached, your email and so forth because we got hacked.

1806
02:15:59,779 --> 02:16:03,002
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, are you talking about the Gawker Network, Kotaku?

1807
02:16:03,642 --> 02:16:04,823
[SPEAKER_06]: No, but there's that too.

1808
02:16:05,784 --> 02:16:06,885
[SPEAKER_02]: That wasn't anonymous either.

1809
02:16:07,065 --> 02:16:07,746
[SPEAKER_06]: That wasn't on his email.

1810
02:16:08,046 --> 02:16:13,190
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody's out there hacking for personal information because maybe somebody in chat will ring a bell.

1811
02:16:13,530 --> 02:16:14,511
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody hacked Gawker.

1812
02:16:14,851 --> 02:16:18,174
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody hacked this email network to get all the emails and so forth.

1813
02:16:18,635 --> 02:16:21,617
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's them that's getting Sony.

1814
02:16:21,857 --> 02:16:24,479
[SPEAKER_06]: I think somebody went after that private information at Sony.

1815
02:16:25,801 --> 02:16:28,463
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, and this is what I have to say too is that

1816
02:16:30,882 --> 02:16:46,714
[SPEAKER_02]: When you have a situation like this where, yeah, you may have an easy person to place blame on, keep in mind that wars have been started over people putting the blame where there was on an innocent party just because of quote circumstantial evidence.

1817
02:16:47,915 --> 02:16:49,176
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't be one of those people.

1818
02:16:49,436 --> 02:16:50,257
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't be a dick like that.

1819
02:16:51,538 --> 02:17:00,344
[SPEAKER_09]: And also with the DDoS attack, you've got hundreds of thousands of computers that have been compromised in some way that are flooding the network with garbage.

1820
02:17:00,384 --> 02:17:05,867
[SPEAKER_09]: It's very hard because you've got all of these compromised computers of just regular PC owners.

1821
02:17:07,148 --> 02:17:12,410
[SPEAKER_09]: It's hard to... As obnoxious as it is, it's very difficult.

1822
02:17:12,610 --> 02:17:16,712
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not an actionable crime is what I'm trying to say because the computers are compromised.

1823
02:17:17,313 --> 02:17:25,136
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're hacking into something and you're getting customer information, which hasn't been confirmed yet, that's like a federal... That's serious shit.

1824
02:17:25,176 --> 02:17:26,156
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's not their M.O.

1825
02:17:26,376 --> 02:17:27,257
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's not what they do.

1826
02:17:27,277 --> 02:17:28,397
[SPEAKER_02]: That's totally not their M.O.

1827
02:17:29,158 --> 02:17:34,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep in mind, all of the stuff that they've been doing is basically forms of vigilantism.

1828
02:17:34,660 --> 02:17:45,703
[SPEAKER_02]: They have gone after people who they have perceived have committed some sort of crime that's not being punished in the proper way and they are going after these people to make their lives miserable.

1829
02:17:45,823 --> 02:17:49,424
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, they'll waste some of your time and some of your money and then that's it.

1830
02:17:49,564 --> 02:17:50,584
[SPEAKER_09]: They'll get their plan across.

1831
02:17:50,824 --> 02:17:56,926
[SPEAKER_02]: But when they've gone after people's information, it's been specific people to have a specific thing happen.

1832
02:17:57,046 --> 02:17:58,507
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got to read some of these comments in chat.

1833
02:17:58,547 --> 02:17:59,367
[SPEAKER_06]: They're piling up here.

1834
02:17:59,487 --> 02:18:02,428
[SPEAKER_06]: In the true Easter spirit, Red Entertainment says the Jews did it.

1835
02:18:02,908 --> 02:18:03,428
[SPEAKER_06]: Happy Easter.

1836
02:18:06,459 --> 02:18:06,920
[SPEAKER_06]: And fuck you.

1837
02:18:07,700 --> 02:18:14,264
[SPEAKER_06]: Defective Candy in our chat room says, the Epsilon email hacking was supposedly accomplished by one rogue individual.

1838
02:18:14,305 --> 02:18:14,585
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1839
02:18:14,625 --> 02:18:15,185
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Epsilon.

1840
02:18:15,265 --> 02:18:16,806
[SPEAKER_06]: Could be a former employee.

1841
02:18:17,106 --> 02:18:17,667
[SPEAKER_06]: It could be.

1842
02:18:17,927 --> 02:18:18,327
[SPEAKER_06]: That's true.

1843
02:18:19,068 --> 02:18:19,428
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

1844
02:18:21,129 --> 02:18:24,271
[SPEAKER_06]: SSJ100 Matt says, whatever happened to just blaming everything on 4chan?

1845
02:18:24,431 --> 02:18:27,093
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought that was anonymous.

1846
02:18:27,133 --> 02:18:28,033
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the home of anonymous.

1847
02:18:28,053 --> 02:18:29,374
[SPEAKER_06]: Slash B. Yeah.

1848
02:18:29,654 --> 02:18:30,355
[SPEAKER_06]: So there you go.

1849
02:18:30,925 --> 02:18:31,866
[SPEAKER_02]: I like what Kajudo said.

1850
02:18:32,366 --> 02:18:33,747
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think Sony was a hack at all.

1851
02:18:33,787 --> 02:18:36,329
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone lost the keys to the big Sony computer room and they can't all get in.

1852
02:18:37,090 --> 02:18:38,150
[SPEAKER_09]: Check the crayon boxes.

1853
02:18:38,971 --> 02:18:39,592
[SPEAKER_02]: Get that leash out.

1854
02:18:39,692 --> 02:18:42,374
[SPEAKER_09]: There's like a cat that unplugged the thing.

1855
02:18:43,855 --> 02:18:45,476
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm in your Sony hacking your store.

1856
02:18:47,057 --> 02:18:51,500
[SPEAKER_02]: But seriously, look at everything.

1857
02:18:51,721 --> 02:18:54,823
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't pick one convenient scapegoat.

1858
02:18:54,903 --> 02:18:57,645
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not very smart, dude.

1859
02:18:59,420 --> 02:18:59,881
[SPEAKER_06]: Next email.

1860
02:19:00,141 --> 02:19:00,581
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, please.

1861
02:19:00,642 --> 02:19:01,823
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay, happy sunshine.

1862
02:19:03,485 --> 02:19:05,147
[SPEAKER_06]: Unicorns that shit rainbows that kill people.

1863
02:19:05,207 --> 02:19:05,668
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay.

1864
02:19:06,609 --> 02:19:07,410
[SPEAKER_06]: Dear peoples.

1865
02:19:07,890 --> 02:19:08,811
[SPEAKER_06]: We're peoples.

1866
02:19:09,673 --> 02:19:10,373
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it's Red Entertainment.

1867
02:19:10,393 --> 02:19:11,375
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we are multiple people.

1868
02:19:12,142 --> 02:19:17,306
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you, I've been following the recent PSN outages since I started popping up on Wednesday night.

1869
02:19:17,727 --> 02:19:20,929
[SPEAKER_02]: When I first discovered these outages, I was frustrated, raged out, and cursed aloud.

1870
02:19:20,969 --> 02:19:22,290
[SPEAKER_02]: My neighbors thought I was killing someone.

1871
02:19:22,330 --> 02:19:22,770
[SPEAKER_02]: Not kidding.

1872
02:19:23,391 --> 02:19:29,055
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, in the process of following the story, I found the story that I'm sure you covered earlier on the show.

1873
02:19:32,398 --> 02:19:34,540
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me see what this is.

1874
02:19:34,580 --> 02:19:38,443
[SPEAKER_06]: Hit by external... Yeah, it's the same story we covered, basically, from another source.

1875
02:19:39,089 --> 02:19:45,156
[SPEAKER_02]: Once I read the story, I became considerably less angry as I can understand that Sony taking actions like this in response to this threat to a point.

1876
02:19:45,537 --> 02:19:47,639
[SPEAKER_02]: However, there is one part of the story that really concerns me.

1877
02:19:48,680 --> 02:19:56,449
[SPEAKER_02]: In order to, quote, verify the smooth and secure operation, end quote, of the services, Sony pulled the plug on both services April 20th.

1878
02:19:57,310 --> 02:19:59,791
[SPEAKER_02]: The sentence gives me an impression that this isn't a simple hacking job.

1879
02:20:00,171 --> 02:20:06,314
[SPEAKER_02]: Given Sony's recent movements in relation to piracy, I believe that this may be the nature of Sony taking down PSN.

1880
02:20:06,974 --> 02:20:14,058
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe someone figured out how to pirate games distributed digitally via PSN.

1881
02:20:14,118 --> 02:20:16,319
[SPEAKER_02]: Feel free to tell me if any of these conclusions are wrong.

1882
02:20:17,239 --> 02:20:21,020
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, why do I have to go through PSN or live to access Hulu Plus or Netflix?

1883
02:20:21,640 --> 02:20:28,682
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, when I want to watch Hulu on my laptop, all I have to do is fire up my browser, go through my ISP to get to what I want to watch.

1884
02:20:29,282 --> 02:20:35,823
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have to go through my laptop's manufacturer-exclusive network to access things, so I don't have to do it on home consoles because they're evil.

1885
02:20:36,424 --> 02:20:37,484
[SPEAKER_02]: Stay Black, Red Entertainment.

1886
02:20:37,804 --> 02:20:44,505
[SPEAKER_02]: This message has been brought to you by the successor to Anonymous, who is actually responsible for PSN being shut down and totally unknown to the public.

1887
02:20:47,242 --> 02:20:48,082
[SPEAKER_02]: Sent from my iPad.

1888
02:20:49,763 --> 02:20:55,345
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, we do have a theory in the chat room on who might be to blame for all of this that's going on on the PlayStation Network.

1889
02:20:56,465 --> 02:20:57,265
[SPEAKER_06]: An interesting theory.

1890
02:21:10,110 --> 02:21:11,270
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep, it's all Canada's fault.

1891
02:21:12,190 --> 02:21:14,071
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, we should blame Skynet.

1892
02:21:15,852 --> 02:21:16,772
[SPEAKER_02]: We did survive Judgment Day.

1893
02:21:17,217 --> 02:21:17,485
[SPEAKER_09]: We did.

1894
02:21:18,640 --> 02:21:46,460
[SPEAKER_09]: in response to that email about why you have to authenticate with the console before you can use Netflix and Hulu for Netflix and Hulu to allow a third party appliance to run their service there needs to be some sort of accountability so that someone doesn't get an $8 Netflix account give their username and password to their 40 friends that have a Playstation 3 and have them all running Netflix off the one account so I think by authenticating into PSN

1895
02:21:48,462 --> 02:21:55,246
[SPEAKER_09]: and it's saying this PSN account with this PlayStation 3 ID is using this Netflix and there's a sync there and that's why they do it.

1896
02:21:55,406 --> 02:21:58,508
[SPEAKER_02]: However, it does not stop people from sharing Netflix accounts over the internet.

1897
02:21:58,769 --> 02:22:00,910
[SPEAKER_06]: Blackwolf says that Netflix will still work.

1898
02:22:00,930 --> 02:22:03,192
[SPEAKER_06]: You just got to keep trying to log in three to five times.

1899
02:22:03,232 --> 02:22:04,292
[SPEAKER_06]: You can get in eventually.

1900
02:22:04,913 --> 02:22:05,333
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

1901
02:22:05,713 --> 02:22:06,654
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't tried on PS3.

1902
02:22:06,674 --> 02:22:10,957
[SPEAKER_06]: I've just been, you know, playing Portal offline.

1903
02:22:12,478 --> 02:22:12,718
[SPEAKER_03]: Addict.

1904
02:22:14,511 --> 02:22:17,092
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it's a bad thing to be addicted to Portal.

1905
02:22:17,172 --> 02:22:18,853
[SPEAKER_06]: You can get down with that one.

1906
02:22:19,213 --> 02:22:19,593
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.

1907
02:22:21,014 --> 02:22:21,254
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1908
02:22:21,934 --> 02:22:22,655
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, OLR.

1909
02:22:22,955 --> 02:22:25,116
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope the move went well for you, Rob.

1910
02:22:25,236 --> 02:22:27,157
[SPEAKER_02]: While you were busy with that, I was busy playing Portal 2.

1911
02:22:28,077 --> 02:22:30,958
[SPEAKER_02]: That game has some of the best writing in anything, period.

1912
02:22:31,238 --> 02:22:31,659
[SPEAKER_06]: Me too.

1913
02:22:31,919 --> 02:22:33,579
[SPEAKER_06]: Salacious Pop, unpack that box.

1914
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:34,880
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to play Portal.

1915
02:22:35,500 --> 02:22:36,481
[SPEAKER_02]: Let alone video games.

1916
02:22:36,921 --> 02:22:40,162
[SPEAKER_02]: It certainly puts out what's out there to shame.

1917
02:22:40,502 --> 02:22:42,563
[SPEAKER_02]: For some reason, I thought of you, Rob, when I saw this article.

1918
02:22:43,043 --> 02:22:44,024
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I have to look at this.

1919
02:22:44,480 --> 02:22:44,801
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh-oh.

1920
02:22:48,726 --> 02:22:49,466
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still loading.

1921
02:22:49,567 --> 02:22:49,767
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on.

1922
02:22:49,787 --> 02:22:51,669
[SPEAKER_09]: There's going to be huge spoilers and you're going to freak out.

1923
02:22:53,612 --> 02:22:57,396
[SPEAKER_02]: Kagura director thought of Nintendo 3DS 3D breast 30 seconds later.

1924
02:22:57,777 --> 02:22:59,139
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, man.

1925
02:23:00,520 --> 02:23:03,184
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a guy who did Half Minute Hero.

1926
02:23:05,267 --> 02:23:05,888
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm telling you.

1927
02:23:06,528 --> 02:23:08,650
[SPEAKER_06]: Didn't I talk about that on the show in the 3DS?

1928
02:23:08,670 --> 02:23:11,331
[SPEAKER_06]: They just need a game that's boobs, boobs, and more boobs.

1929
02:23:12,012 --> 02:23:12,832
[SPEAKER_06]: Boobs in 3D.

1930
02:23:12,872 --> 02:23:13,353
[SPEAKER_06]: Big boobs.

1931
02:23:13,413 --> 02:23:13,953
[SPEAKER_06]: Little boobs.

1932
02:23:14,493 --> 02:23:15,054
[SPEAKER_06]: Black boobs.

1933
02:23:15,114 --> 02:23:15,654
[SPEAKER_06]: White boobs.

1934
02:23:16,154 --> 02:23:16,615
[SPEAKER_06]: All boobs.

1935
02:23:17,115 --> 02:23:18,676
[SPEAKER_06]: Boobs with big nips.

1936
02:23:18,856 --> 02:23:19,837
[SPEAKER_06]: Boobs with small nips.

1937
02:23:19,997 --> 02:23:20,517
[SPEAKER_06]: All types.

1938
02:23:22,539 --> 02:23:23,940
[SPEAKER_06]: United Nations of boobs.

1939
02:23:24,600 --> 02:23:25,421
[SPEAKER_06]: Coming soon on the 3DS.

1940
02:23:26,710 --> 02:23:33,894
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you've ever heard of this before, but for the last few years there's been a convention dedicated to the world's favorite hedgehog held in London, Summer of Sonic.

1941
02:23:34,394 --> 02:23:42,578
[SPEAKER_02]: They usually have early previews of coming games and occasionally panels slash Q&As with developers as well as writers for the old UK comic.

1942
02:23:42,999 --> 02:23:44,980
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hear this year for the US comics too.

1943
02:23:45,340 --> 02:23:47,581
[SPEAKER_02]: This year's is on July 25th if anyone's interested.

1944
02:23:47,841 --> 02:23:48,862
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love to go.

1945
02:23:48,942 --> 02:23:50,202
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody get me to Europe.

1946
02:23:51,543 --> 02:23:53,785
[SPEAKER_02]: hear you later, CatastrophicMagi P.S.

1947
02:23:53,865 --> 02:23:58,109
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really excited about the announcement of the Persona 4 anime P.P.S.

1948
02:23:58,229 --> 02:24:00,551
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey Jamie, have you seen the new episode of Doctor Who yet?

1949
02:24:01,772 --> 02:24:17,104
[SPEAKER_02]: Every time someone does the colon P I do Yes, I saw it and it was amazing and then I was really pissed off at the end and then I saw the preview for next episode so I wasn't as pissed off Okay I actually did pause it one time and go, that is bullshit and then kept watching

1950
02:24:20,989 --> 02:24:22,970
[SPEAKER_02]: As I understand, I'm not the only person that did that.

1951
02:24:23,190 --> 02:24:24,351
[SPEAKER_06]: Do I do that when I watch TV?

1952
02:24:24,671 --> 02:24:25,491
[SPEAKER_06]: Yell back at the TV?

1953
02:24:26,452 --> 02:24:28,033
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think I do that.

1954
02:24:28,453 --> 02:24:29,053
[SPEAKER_02]: I downloaded it.

1955
02:24:29,693 --> 02:24:32,655
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes when I watch Survivor, I go, oh no, he didn't!

1956
02:24:33,215 --> 02:24:34,355
[SPEAKER_06]: That's about as bad as I get.

1957
02:24:34,416 --> 02:24:37,097
[SPEAKER_09]: You talk during WoW when something bad happens.

1958
02:24:37,257 --> 02:24:38,617
[SPEAKER_06]: I do talk during WoW.

1959
02:24:38,738 --> 02:24:39,058
[SPEAKER_06]: I do.

1960
02:24:39,938 --> 02:24:41,659
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank God Ventrilo isn't always on.

1961
02:24:41,679 --> 02:24:42,879
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's just say that much.

1962
02:24:43,520 --> 02:24:45,601
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do you think I don't log into Ventrilo that often?

1963
02:24:46,703 --> 02:24:48,707
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan is usually sitting right where you're sitting, Alan.

1964
02:24:49,929 --> 02:24:54,699
[SPEAKER_02]: Looking over at me like, you really, really get dirty mouth when you play this game.

1965
02:24:54,719 --> 02:24:56,903
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, bitches.

1966
02:24:57,344 --> 02:24:57,605
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.

1967
02:24:58,976 --> 02:25:04,020
[SPEAKER_09]: and sometimes Rob will sign into Vent and just be like, oh, hey, what's going on?

1968
02:25:04,220 --> 02:25:06,461
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'll be sitting right next to him and I'm like, I'm fine.

1969
02:25:06,582 --> 02:25:09,143
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm reading, I'm reading, oh, no, they didn't.

1970
02:25:09,163 --> 02:25:10,444
[SPEAKER_09]: He's like, I'm on Vent, duh.

1971
02:25:10,464 --> 02:25:11,785
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, I don't know your life.

1972
02:25:11,805 --> 02:25:12,646
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1973
02:25:14,948 --> 02:25:16,008
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, is that it for emails?

1974
02:25:17,819 --> 02:25:18,299
[SPEAKER_06]: That is it.

1975
02:25:18,580 --> 02:25:20,381
[SPEAKER_06]: We need more emails for next week.

1976
02:25:20,421 --> 02:25:22,182
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to beat the emails we had this week.

1977
02:25:22,222 --> 02:25:24,984
[SPEAKER_06]: I want DarkSakura's email bag to take like an hour next week.

1978
02:25:25,364 --> 02:25:25,764
[SPEAKER_06]: Mailbag.

1979
02:25:25,784 --> 02:25:32,989
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, if this happens, okay, if we get, okay, if we break 10 emails next week, you have to get me tacos.

1980
02:25:35,219 --> 02:25:36,419
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm gonna get you tacos.

1981
02:25:37,020 --> 02:25:37,380
[SPEAKER_06]: Fine.

1982
02:25:37,920 --> 02:25:38,700
[SPEAKER_06]: You want, fine.

1983
02:25:38,840 --> 02:25:42,062
[SPEAKER_06]: We get more than 10 emails and not all from the same address.

1984
02:25:42,522 --> 02:25:43,662
[SPEAKER_02]: Not all from the same address.

1985
02:25:43,962 --> 02:25:45,103
[SPEAKER_02]: And 10 meaningful emails.

1986
02:25:45,123 --> 02:25:48,884
[SPEAKER_02]: Unique, real emails that are at least a paragraph in length.

1987
02:25:49,124 --> 02:25:50,265
[SPEAKER_06]: And with good grammar.

1988
02:25:50,285 --> 02:25:52,326
[SPEAKER_02]: Three to four sentences with proper grammar.

1989
02:25:52,906 --> 02:25:53,886
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob will buy me tacos.

1990
02:25:54,006 --> 02:25:55,187
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I will buy you tacos.

1991
02:25:56,767 --> 02:25:57,908
[SPEAKER_06]: Taco flavored pink berry.

1992
02:25:57,928 --> 02:25:58,468
[SPEAKER_06]: Ew.

1993
02:25:59,318 --> 02:26:06,812
[SPEAKER_09]: They're gonna be from emails like, you know, ShermieCat, or ThisIsTotallyNotDan Sorry mom, I pooped in the kitchen again!

1994
02:26:08,334 --> 02:26:09,275
[SPEAKER_02]: Love your cat.

1995
02:26:09,535 --> 02:26:11,097
[SPEAKER_09]: Number one Dan fan at Gmail.

1996
02:26:11,117 --> 02:26:12,338
[SPEAKER_09]: You should have Dan on more often.

1997
02:26:12,358 --> 02:26:12,518
[SPEAKER_06]: P.S.

1998
02:26:12,738 --> 02:26:13,139
[SPEAKER_06]: Bart.

1999
02:26:15,301 --> 02:26:21,466
[SPEAKER_06]: We should get like a taco tote board and like show how many emails we've got during the week and then be like, let's see if Jamie's going to get tacos.

2000
02:26:22,227 --> 02:26:24,269
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, we're at seven emails so far this week.

2001
02:26:24,790 --> 02:26:25,891
[SPEAKER_02]: No taco for Jamie.

2002
02:26:25,911 --> 02:26:27,772
[SPEAKER_06]: Can we install that on the website?

2003
02:26:28,954 --> 02:26:29,674
[SPEAKER_02]: The taco meter.

2004
02:26:30,335 --> 02:26:31,316
[SPEAKER_06]: The taco meter.

2005
02:26:31,906 --> 02:26:35,568
[SPEAKER_02]: I've already declared that Taco Tuesday is an official holiday every week.

2006
02:26:36,109 --> 02:26:39,731
[SPEAKER_06]: Black Wolf says, can I write a paragraph about how tasty the tacos would be?

2007
02:26:41,492 --> 02:26:42,212
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, you can.

2008
02:26:42,372 --> 02:26:43,973
[SPEAKER_02]: I will accept emails about tacos.

2009
02:26:43,993 --> 02:26:46,135
[SPEAKER_02]: Because tacos are amazing.

2010
02:26:47,199 --> 02:26:49,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, you know, you can also do it about taco, which is octopus.

2011
02:26:50,181 --> 02:26:50,802
[SPEAKER_02]: I love taco yaki.

2012
02:26:51,082 --> 02:26:55,766
[SPEAKER_06]: Or, you could write a dissertation about the 80s song, Puttin' on the Ritz, by Taco.

2013
02:26:57,127 --> 02:26:57,287
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

2014
02:26:57,807 --> 02:27:02,611
[SPEAKER_02]: It has to be video game related, or actual delicious crispy taco related.

2015
02:27:02,851 --> 02:27:05,053
[SPEAKER_06]: Or, tostadas, I take those too.

2016
02:27:05,193 --> 02:27:07,755
[SPEAKER_06]: For fuck's sake, can we move on to another topic?

2017
02:27:07,775 --> 02:27:08,515
[SPEAKER_02]: Taco!

2018
02:27:08,815 --> 02:27:09,036
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

2019
02:27:10,703 --> 02:27:16,190
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, if you want to send us an email, of course, mailbag.orangeloungeradio.com This is the part of the show where we get angsty.

2020
02:27:16,250 --> 02:27:17,652
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the FUs of the Week segment.

2021
02:27:34,946 --> 02:27:48,302
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura My FU goes to being really hungry right now because over the last whole week I've maybe had at most 400 calories a day because I haven't really been able to keep anything down.

2022
02:27:48,622 --> 02:27:50,164
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, that candle came from the dollar store.

2023
02:27:51,425 --> 02:27:52,246
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2024
02:28:19,324 --> 02:28:20,986
[SPEAKER_02]: I ate matzo when I woke up.

2025
02:28:22,087 --> 02:28:23,628
[SPEAKER_02]: And I normally do not like matzo by itself.

2026
02:28:24,329 --> 02:28:24,829
[SPEAKER_02]: I ate some.

2027
02:28:25,310 --> 02:28:26,952
[SPEAKER_02]: I want food.

2028
02:28:27,452 --> 02:28:28,213
[SPEAKER_02]: I want a salad.

2029
02:28:29,314 --> 02:28:31,236
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, what I want is Pink Fairy, but it probably closed.

2030
02:28:32,146 --> 02:28:34,068
[SPEAKER_06]: The whole Easter thing kind of makes places close.

2031
02:28:34,288 --> 02:28:39,652
[SPEAKER_02]: But a heart to you from my wonderful coffee.

2032
02:28:39,772 --> 02:28:40,292
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you're welcome.

2033
02:28:40,493 --> 02:28:42,754
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is why I have some semblance of alertness.

2034
02:28:42,954 --> 02:28:46,437
[SPEAKER_06]: Folks don't know, but a lot of times before the show I do make a Starbucks run.

2035
02:28:47,138 --> 02:28:48,158
[SPEAKER_06]: There's Starbucks everywhere.

2036
02:28:48,219 --> 02:28:52,942
[SPEAKER_06]: Like saying there's one not far from Jamie's house is like, you know, gee, there's grass in the backyard.

2037
02:28:54,724 --> 02:28:55,784
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, there's a Starbucks nearby.

2038
02:28:55,804 --> 02:28:58,586
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't tend to get coffee a lot.

2039
02:28:58,947 --> 02:29:01,709
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually going to if I have it at night, it's going to be decaf.

2040
02:29:01,969 --> 02:29:03,630
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you did request a decaf.

2041
02:29:03,710 --> 02:29:04,710
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll remember that in the future.

2042
02:29:05,910 --> 02:29:08,671
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, SalaciousPop, do you have any FUs for this week?

2043
02:29:10,072 --> 02:29:14,073
[SPEAKER_09]: Just not being completely 100% done with my old place.

2044
02:29:14,953 --> 02:29:18,334
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm happy for my former roommate because he found someone to move in with him.

2045
02:29:19,375 --> 02:29:25,857
[SPEAKER_09]: But just that, having to go back to San Francisco one last time and just unpacking in general is obnoxious.

2046
02:29:26,677 --> 02:29:28,378
[SPEAKER_09]: But otherwise, that's all.

2047
02:29:29,138 --> 02:29:29,578
[SPEAKER_09]: Pretty minor.

2048
02:29:30,550 --> 02:29:56,480
[SPEAKER_06]: um yeah I don't have a lot to be angsty about I mean there's a lot of really good stuff going on for me right now a lot of like happy news I don't want to make you par for nothing but it's good stuff I will say F you to that freaking headache I had earlier there was almost migraine status I would say I would say like if headaches were on like the terrorism color chart I would say the headache I had was code orange it was pretty bad but it wasn't like really bad so there you go

2049
02:29:58,121 --> 02:30:01,843
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, that does it for the FUs of the week for now.

2050
02:30:01,884 --> 02:30:02,264
[SPEAKER_06]: Moving on.

2051
02:30:02,724 --> 02:30:09,989
[SPEAKER_06]: Blackwolf is pointing out in our chat room that apparently Taco Bell has a lame flash game called Taco Fu at TacoBell.com slash Taco Fu.

2052
02:30:10,009 --> 02:30:10,729
[SPEAKER_02]: That's okay.

2053
02:30:11,009 --> 02:30:13,331
[SPEAKER_06]: Way to merge the worlds of tacos and video games.

2054
02:30:13,551 --> 02:30:15,252
[SPEAKER_06]: Just want to give an A plus to Bobby.

2055
02:30:15,292 --> 02:30:17,253
[SPEAKER_06]: Looks like a... That's why he has his own show, folks.

2056
02:30:17,313 --> 02:30:19,415
[SPEAKER_09]: Burger King's reigning...

2057
02:30:20,075 --> 02:30:23,618
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, Sneak King and shit, those games were awesome.

2058
02:30:23,658 --> 02:30:24,238
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, why?

2059
02:30:24,599 --> 02:30:26,380
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, for five bucks, they were great.

2060
02:30:26,640 --> 02:30:28,742
[SPEAKER_06]: Why didn't they ever do that again?

2061
02:30:28,762 --> 02:30:32,584
[SPEAKER_02]: They should do an update, a new BurgerTime and call it TacoTime.

2062
02:30:33,405 --> 02:30:35,707
[SPEAKER_06]: Weren't they supposed to do something with Kinect, I thought?

2063
02:30:36,107 --> 02:30:36,527
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

2064
02:31:01,781 --> 02:31:06,846
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so Ubisoft is developing a guitar game.

2065
02:31:07,046 --> 02:31:19,778
[SPEAKER_09]: It seems like maybe they'd be a little... That trainer has left the station, perhaps, but they're working on a game called Rocksmith, which sounds a lot like Pro Mode in Rock Band, except with a guitar.

2066
02:31:20,178 --> 02:31:23,441
[SPEAKER_09]: You can play this game with real guitars, and the...

2067
02:31:25,203 --> 02:31:33,428
[SPEAKER_09]: The UI and how the notes, because you know how DJ Hero, Guitar Hero, Rock Band has the note highway that scrolls vertically.

2068
02:31:33,989 --> 02:31:41,854
[SPEAKER_09]: This one uses more of a 3D plane where you're in front and you see the notes coming from the back of the screen moving towards you.

2069
02:31:43,175 --> 02:31:44,395
[SPEAKER_09]: So it looks really complicated.

2070
02:31:44,436 --> 02:31:46,457
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure how much of a market there might be for this.

2071
02:31:47,117 --> 02:31:53,982
[SPEAKER_09]: But anyway, they are demoing the game at South by Southwest in Texas, which is a

2072
02:31:55,836 --> 02:32:24,279
[SPEAKER_09]: it's a music and movies it's kind of like a hipstery I know I was like if you want to find a place where all the hipsters are at at one time like that's not Tumblr yeah but it's not like a Lollapalooza there are a lot of great bands there but it's also movies and art and it's a whole pop culture thing so yeah Rocksmith is going to be at South by Southwest they're going to have musicians play it and just show it off I think they've got a whole Rocksmith tour bus that sets up bass and it's going to be at South by Southwest fun

2073
02:32:25,020 --> 02:32:30,352
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I like the way they've done that where they have like the guitar silhouette in front of the falling stream of notes.

2074
02:32:30,392 --> 02:32:31,735
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of a neat little way to do it.

2075
02:32:32,757 --> 02:32:32,878
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.

2076
02:32:33,496 --> 02:32:37,778
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, we'll see if this game can actually be successful, kind of break the recent curse of music games.

2077
02:32:38,558 --> 02:32:38,938
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

2078
02:32:39,938 --> 02:32:41,759
[SPEAKER_06]: One more story for you guys.

2079
02:32:43,140 --> 02:32:45,240
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody get out your 40s and get ready to pour it.

2080
02:32:46,221 --> 02:32:48,942
[SPEAKER_06]: The PSP Go is officially dead.

2081
02:32:49,102 --> 02:32:50,102
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right, folks.

2082
02:32:50,182 --> 02:32:51,163
[SPEAKER_06]: Pour out the 40s.

2083
02:32:51,903 --> 02:32:52,703
[SPEAKER_09]: Devastated.

2084
02:32:53,023 --> 02:32:53,924
[SPEAKER_09]: How did this happen?

2085
02:32:54,244 --> 02:32:54,804
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

2086
02:32:54,924 --> 02:32:57,205
[SPEAKER_09]: This is... I don't understand.

2087
02:32:57,905 --> 02:33:18,452
[SPEAKER_06]: apparently the whole thing is started by a Sony shop employee saying that the store was not going to get any more shipments and then the PSP Go disappeared from the Sony store page Sony is not confirming the news but in their statement they're kind of trying to say well why are you asking about the Go shouldn't we be talking about the NGP the awesome new system coming out from Sony

2088
02:33:19,429 --> 02:33:24,716
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so although Sony hasn't confirmed it, they haven't really denied it either.

2089
02:33:25,417 --> 02:33:28,301
[SPEAKER_06]: In the UK as well, the PSP Go production has ceased.

2090
02:33:28,341 --> 02:33:29,302
[SPEAKER_06]: That has been proven.

2091
02:33:29,702 --> 02:33:31,925
[SPEAKER_06]: So the PSP Go, it's dead.

2092
02:33:32,606 --> 02:33:34,629
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's basically become the sort of

2093
02:33:36,281 --> 02:33:42,025
[SPEAKER_09]: The cousin that is touched in the head that now lives in the attic that the family doesn't talk about.

2094
02:33:42,765 --> 02:33:44,747
[SPEAKER_09]: Those thuds that you hear, we don't know.

2095
02:33:45,747 --> 02:33:47,348
[SPEAKER_09]: No, he died when he was born.

2096
02:33:47,369 --> 02:33:48,129
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't know who that is.

2097
02:33:48,609 --> 02:33:49,930
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of the comments from our chat room.

2098
02:33:49,970 --> 02:33:53,393
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, the raging comedy club that is the Orange Lounge Radio chat room.

2099
02:33:53,713 --> 02:33:55,814
[SPEAKER_06]: Frisbee calls it the PSP Go Away.

2100
02:33:56,715 --> 02:33:57,075
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

2101
02:33:57,295 --> 02:33:59,997
[SPEAKER_06]: Redertainment says, wait, the PSP Go wasn't already dead?

2102
02:34:01,038 --> 02:34:05,981
[SPEAKER_06]: Alpha Cananigram says, wait, wasn't this debunked saying only Europe isn't going to carry it and US is still going to have them?

2103
02:34:06,601 --> 02:34:10,502
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, shall we open up the Skype line?

2104
02:34:31,351 --> 02:34:32,251
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, do it!

2105
02:34:55,783 --> 02:34:57,004
[SPEAKER_06]: Game OLR

2106
02:35:21,065 --> 02:35:27,109
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing much, just like chilling in my room, fixing other people's PCs, resting up for tomorrow's work day.

2107
02:35:27,510 --> 02:35:28,110
[SPEAKER_06]: What's tomorrow?

2108
02:35:28,190 --> 02:35:28,570
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, work?

2109
02:35:28,630 --> 02:35:29,271
[SPEAKER_06]: Back to the grind?

2110
02:35:29,971 --> 02:35:31,072
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, back to the grind.

2111
02:35:31,412 --> 02:35:32,133
[SPEAKER_00]: Evil grind.

2112
02:35:32,713 --> 02:35:33,954
[SPEAKER_00]: Evil post-Easter grind.

2113
02:35:35,135 --> 02:35:39,138
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to talk about something from our show or some other story we didn't cover?

2114
02:35:39,218 --> 02:35:49,525
[SPEAKER_00]: I've noticed that the folks at Gearbox have been really good sports recently with that proposal that they did, you know, that Borderlands proposal that they did for this fan out in Texas.

2115
02:35:50,625 --> 02:36:00,631
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the video where I think Claptrap actually, the voice of Claptrap, actually they put up a video using that as a way to propose to a girl.

2116
02:36:00,911 --> 02:36:01,151
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

2117
02:36:01,691 --> 02:36:02,752
[SPEAKER_00]: Just pull it up right now.

2118
02:36:02,972 --> 02:36:07,674
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we did cover it at the top of the segment, just so you know if you missed it.

2119
02:36:08,295 --> 02:36:08,995
[SPEAKER_06]: We did talk about it.

2120
02:36:09,615 --> 02:36:10,316
[SPEAKER_06]: What did you think about it?

2121
02:36:11,209 --> 02:36:12,971
[SPEAKER_00]: Gearbox Gearbox is also like

2122
02:36:34,266 --> 02:36:34,506
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.

2123
02:36:56,144 --> 02:37:04,610
[SPEAKER_06]: That is how history will smile upon them fondly, unless the game is the most atrocious piece of shit we've ever played, but I'm hoping it's not that bad.

2124
02:37:04,910 --> 02:37:14,436
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, even though you do mention shit in that sentence, you do know you could actually use excrement as a weapon in that game.

2125
02:37:14,996 --> 02:37:16,137
[SPEAKER_06]: Hooray, I'm so excited.

2126
02:37:16,778 --> 02:37:19,660
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you could actually shit bomb people in that game.

2127
02:37:19,700 --> 02:37:23,843
[SPEAKER_06]: I've always wanted to fling my poo in a video game where I wasn't playing as a monkey.

2128
02:37:25,924 --> 02:37:26,545
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm touched.

2129
02:37:27,665 --> 02:37:29,807
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a while ago, I actually seen the video.

2130
02:37:31,428 --> 02:37:33,209
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I know it's shocking.

2131
02:37:33,269 --> 02:37:41,335
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, right now, I'm just trying to gather up the... Just trying to see what I can get right now in terms of games.

2132
02:37:41,375 --> 02:37:41,535
[SPEAKER_00]: Like...

2133
02:37:42,871 --> 02:37:43,952
[SPEAKER_00]: Mortal Kombat vs. Capcom 3

2134
02:37:57,230 --> 02:38:00,272
[SPEAKER_00]: It's either that or, I mean, it's that and Eleanor and Brink.

2135
02:38:00,852 --> 02:38:04,415
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, it's going to be, we're about, we're approaching some busy times.

2136
02:38:05,015 --> 02:38:06,976
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the busy time was this past week.

2137
02:38:07,036 --> 02:38:14,801
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, something that didn't even freaking occur to me is that this week and the next week, depending on where you live, is spring break.

2138
02:38:15,321 --> 02:38:18,303
[SPEAKER_06]: Usually it's either the week before or the week after Easter is spring break.

2139
02:38:18,343 --> 02:38:19,004
[SPEAKER_06]: Ours just ended.

2140
02:38:19,084 --> 02:38:20,545
[SPEAKER_06]: So these games coming out.

2141
02:38:21,065 --> 02:38:22,646
[SPEAKER_06]: What, in Japan or getting hammered by Anonymous?

2142
02:38:22,706 --> 02:38:25,068
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm pretty sure they cracked open one of their holes.

2143
02:38:48,261 --> 02:38:53,084
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this is somebody who's done something a lot more serious than the DDoS.

2144
02:38:53,505 --> 02:38:55,486
[SPEAKER_06]: I think personal information has been compromised.

2145
02:38:55,846 --> 02:38:57,788
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there's going to be more to develop on this.

2146
02:38:58,148 --> 02:38:59,849
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, I could be talking out of my butt.

2147
02:38:59,889 --> 02:39:00,450
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fine.

2148
02:39:00,490 --> 02:39:02,291
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm some schmo with a podcast on the internet.

2149
02:39:02,551 --> 02:39:05,814
[SPEAKER_06]: But when Sony isn't being up front, I'm left to speculate.

2150
02:39:05,894 --> 02:39:12,779
[SPEAKER_00]: Sony is basically acting like any other Japanese person would by not revealing any damning information at the moment.

2151
02:39:14,180 --> 02:39:18,364
[SPEAKER_00]: They're trying to make it seem not as bad as it is, but it's a lot worse.

2152
02:39:19,084 --> 02:39:28,313
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, as I said, you could draw parallels to the way Japan handled the whole nuclear reactor crisis and the way they were with that power company.

2153
02:39:28,573 --> 02:39:33,336
[SPEAKER_06]: Aren't we getting a little... Okay, isn't this a little tinfoil hat?

2154
02:39:33,856 --> 02:39:35,958
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's like, it's any government.

2155
02:39:36,058 --> 02:39:40,760
[SPEAKER_00]: The Japanese are very, you know, they're open about it, though.

2156
02:39:40,841 --> 02:39:47,705
[SPEAKER_00]: They're basically, they openly lie to people so that way they can look good, or they can not stir any panic.

2157
02:39:48,205 --> 02:39:58,071
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, would you rather hear from Sony that personal information has been compromised now, and then you're going to have people bitching in the forums and everywhere else, and Congress getting involved?

2158
02:39:58,464 --> 02:40:04,490
[SPEAKER_00]: or would you rather have that later on when it's less of a problem and they're actually back online?

2159
02:40:04,630 --> 02:40:07,953
[SPEAKER_06]: I would rather have it now because it's my fucking information.

2160
02:40:09,515 --> 02:40:11,377
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's up to Sony to decide.

2161
02:40:11,837 --> 02:40:13,639
[SPEAKER_00]: They personally have it in their possession.

2162
02:40:14,339 --> 02:40:17,663
[SPEAKER_00]: You gave it to them as a contract to join PSN.

2163
02:40:17,683 --> 02:40:22,788
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not like you can get it back somehow.

2164
02:40:24,127 --> 02:40:31,274
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have to realize that I'm pretty certain it's a lot worse than what they're actually going to say.

2165
02:40:32,054 --> 02:40:37,079
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want to create panic or else that's going to hurt their stock, that's going to hurt their reputation.

2166
02:40:37,369 --> 02:40:39,050
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, and that's all part of the panic.

2167
02:40:55,982 --> 02:41:10,909
[SPEAKER_00]: If they say that now unless they find a way to do damage control then it's going to sink their stock pretty fast unless they find a way to say it in a way where it's not that big of a threat.

2168
02:41:12,839 --> 02:41:14,000
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though it actually is.

2169
02:41:14,120 --> 02:41:25,187
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's the whole point is that they have to, from a PR perspective, they have to release it in a way that it doesn't impact their reputation and whatever else they have on the line.

2170
02:41:25,407 --> 02:41:26,408
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well we will see.

2171
02:41:26,448 --> 02:41:35,674
[SPEAKER_06]: Next week, I think we can both agree that next week is going to be a very interesting week and hopefully we're not sitting here a week from now saying, oh, we're on day 12 of the PSN outage.

2172
02:41:36,075 --> 02:41:37,856
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, Zacco, I gotta let you go to get more calls.

2173
02:41:38,376 --> 02:41:41,578
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't wait to see what emails we get in response to your call tonight, but have a good one, buddy.

2174
02:41:41,818 --> 02:41:42,379
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, have a good one.

2175
02:41:42,399 --> 02:41:42,619
[SPEAKER_06]: Later.

2176
02:41:43,820 --> 02:41:44,140
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

2177
02:41:44,761 --> 02:41:47,463
[SPEAKER_06]: The views and opinions expressed by the callers not necessarily reflect those.

2178
02:41:47,523 --> 02:41:49,364
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

2179
02:41:49,384 --> 02:41:52,367
[SPEAKER_06]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or I use your name on Skype as Orange Lounge Radio.

2180
02:41:52,607 --> 02:41:56,910
[SPEAKER_06]: Salacious Pop doing his due diligence during that call finding some last minute stories.

2181
02:41:57,110 --> 02:41:57,851
[SPEAKER_06]: Gold star for you.

2182
02:41:58,822 --> 02:42:09,492
[SPEAKER_09]: South Korea yesterday voted on a curfew that would prevent children under the age of 15 to play online games from midnight until 6am.

2183
02:42:09,732 --> 02:42:12,214
[SPEAKER_09]: So no more all-nighters for the StarCraft 2.

2184
02:42:12,875 --> 02:42:14,396
[SPEAKER_09]: It's all PC gaming it sounds like.

2185
02:42:14,456 --> 02:42:15,917
[SPEAKER_09]: Instead you need to be studying.

2186
02:42:16,178 --> 02:42:16,258
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

2187
02:42:16,938 --> 02:42:22,443
[SPEAKER_09]: And I guess it's being blocked on the ISP level, the DNS, to the gaming servers.

2188
02:42:22,783 --> 02:42:25,446
[SPEAKER_09]: If the parents register that they have a kid, they get cut off.

2189
02:42:25,506 --> 02:42:27,528
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of scary what the government can do at that level.

2190
02:42:27,588 --> 02:42:28,588
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very interesting.

2191
02:42:28,609 --> 02:42:28,809
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2192
02:42:29,109 --> 02:42:29,770
[SPEAKER_06]: We got a phone call.

2193
02:42:29,930 --> 02:42:30,170
[SPEAKER_06]: Hold on.

2194
02:42:30,190 --> 02:42:31,691
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll revisit this thought in a minute.

2195
02:42:31,751 --> 02:42:32,652
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2196
02:42:32,672 --> 02:42:32,972
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

2197
02:42:33,753 --> 02:42:34,274
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, guys.

2198
02:42:34,294 --> 02:42:35,114
[SPEAKER_06]: This is Blue Swim.

2199
02:42:35,254 --> 02:42:36,155
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, Blue Swim.

2200
02:42:36,255 --> 02:42:37,356
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I love the enthusiasm.

2201
02:42:37,396 --> 02:42:38,077
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you, my friend?

2202
02:42:39,078 --> 02:42:39,858
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm doing just fine.

2203
02:42:39,878 --> 02:42:40,619
[SPEAKER_04]: How about you guys?

2204
02:42:40,739 --> 02:42:41,039
[SPEAKER_06]: Good.

2205
02:42:41,100 --> 02:42:42,321
[SPEAKER_06]: I wish we had more callers calling in.

2206
02:42:42,361 --> 02:42:43,362
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, guys.

2207
02:42:44,673 --> 02:42:47,874
[SPEAKER_06]: First time caller as well.

2208
02:42:48,074 --> 02:42:48,995
[SPEAKER_06]: What's on your mind, Blue Swim?

2209
02:42:50,455 --> 02:42:59,819
[SPEAKER_04]: I was wondering what you guys thought of BlazBlue, Continuum Shift 2, and Dead or Alive Dimensions going practically head-to-head at the end of May.

2210
02:43:01,249 --> 02:43:06,052
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, well, you know, it's not the first time that fighters have really gone against each other, I don't think.

2211
02:43:06,152 --> 02:43:13,736
[SPEAKER_06]: Didn't Street Fighter 4 come out at the same time as... Oh, God, there was something else that came out, I thought, right around the same time.

2212
02:43:13,776 --> 02:43:14,696
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe somebody in Chow will get me.

2213
02:43:14,856 --> 02:43:17,117
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but we ignored it because it was Street Fighter 4 coming out.

2214
02:43:17,718 --> 02:43:18,178
[SPEAKER_06]: For real.

2215
02:43:18,838 --> 02:43:18,918
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

2216
02:43:20,519 --> 02:43:34,305
[SPEAKER_06]: I think these two series are kind of separate enough where they can coexist peacefully because let's face it, BlazBlue, BlazBlue, whatever you want to call it, very heavily Japanese influenced, very anime, very, you know, all that stuff.

2217
02:43:34,645 --> 02:43:42,268
[SPEAKER_06]: Dead or Alive, as much as it's very Japanese as well, don't get me wrong, it's very much more for the T&A audience.

2218
02:43:42,788 --> 02:43:43,609
[SPEAKER_06]: Tickle, tickle.

2219
02:43:44,089 --> 02:43:44,429
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

2220
02:43:44,469 --> 02:43:47,590
[SPEAKER_06]: It's more of the Texas game because everything's bigger in Texas.

2221
02:43:47,610 --> 02:43:48,471
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

2222
02:43:49,899 --> 02:43:55,880
[SPEAKER_06]: and so that's kind of why I'm like I think these two games can coexist they have very different audiences

2223
02:43:57,520 --> 02:44:11,173
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think that with the 3DS having three major fighters in the first two months of its life, it's going to turn it into a portable fighting game, like the portable fighting game platform?

2224
02:44:11,574 --> 02:44:12,334
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes and no.

2225
02:44:12,495 --> 02:44:18,020
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, when those three games are probably the only three games worth owning on the 3DS right now, yes a little bit.

2226
02:44:18,340 --> 02:44:19,281
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I shouldn't say that.

2227
02:44:19,361 --> 02:44:20,422
[SPEAKER_06]: I also bought Pilotwings.

2228
02:44:20,462 --> 02:44:21,143
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't played it yet.

2229
02:44:21,623 --> 02:44:43,427
[SPEAKER_06]: uh it's just it's a little frustrating there wasn't a bigger title um but you know looking at what Street Fighter 4 does I mean it really brings pretty much the whole experience of the Xbox version to the portable console and what's interesting about that is that a lot of times you used to hear this shit right like when Mortal Kombat came out on the Game Boy it was like

2230
02:44:43,887 --> 02:44:50,434
[SPEAKER_06]: experience the arcade experience on the go and it's like, dude, this game fucking blows.

2231
02:44:50,774 --> 02:44:55,139
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I've got two buttons and it's all like boop, boop, boop, boop.

2232
02:44:55,199 --> 02:44:56,881
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got like three frames a second.

2233
02:44:57,141 --> 02:44:58,102
[SPEAKER_06]: This game sucks.

2234
02:44:58,943 --> 02:44:59,964
[SPEAKER_06]: But Street Fighter 4, it

2235
02:45:01,525 --> 02:45:04,447
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty much plays really like the Xbox versions.

2236
02:45:04,787 --> 02:45:07,769
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll tell you my biggest bitch about the game is the controls.

2237
02:45:08,229 --> 02:45:18,035
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I think it's because I'm not a kid and I have fat hands, but the 3DS thing does not feel very good in my fat hands for trying to play a fighter with the L and R buttons and everything.

2238
02:45:18,075 --> 02:45:26,340
[SPEAKER_09]: The analog thumb thing, in my opinion, is too slippery and the D-pad is too small for my giant spindly man hands.

2239
02:45:26,480 --> 02:45:29,962
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't like where the D-pad is positioned as far as like a fighting game goes.

2240
02:45:30,062 --> 02:45:30,843
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a little weird.

2241
02:45:31,533 --> 02:45:37,698
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it cramps the crap out of my hands when I'm playing Bison, trying to do a knee-press nightmare or something like that.

2242
02:45:37,838 --> 02:45:39,039
[SPEAKER_04]: It kills my fingers.

2243
02:45:39,279 --> 02:45:46,004
[SPEAKER_06]: Yet, I decided to go online and do the whole internet match earlier, and I got my ass handed to me by some asshole playing as Cody.

2244
02:45:46,565 --> 02:45:51,529
[SPEAKER_06]: Seems like every asshole on Street Fighter 4 plays Cody, and I call them assholes because they're better than me.

2245
02:45:54,011 --> 02:45:56,733
[SPEAKER_06]: What fighting game are you looking forward to out of those two?

2246
02:45:58,410 --> 02:46:03,434
[SPEAKER_04]: I pretty much bought the 3DS at launch, expecting Dead or Alive to be there.

2247
02:46:03,554 --> 02:46:09,019
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been a hardcore Dead or Alive fan since 2002, I want to say.

2248
02:46:09,359 --> 02:46:17,305
[SPEAKER_04]: It's prevented me from trading in my original Xbox when I discovered the Dead or Alive 3 demo on the demo disc.

2249
02:46:17,465 --> 02:46:17,606
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm-hmm.

2250
02:46:18,646 --> 02:46:23,632
[SPEAKER_04]: and ever since then I've been absolutely hooked on the franchise.

2251
02:46:24,012 --> 02:46:31,019
[SPEAKER_04]: I've put maybe 300 hours into Dead or Alive Ultimate and another 100 plus in Dead or Alive 4.

2252
02:46:31,900 --> 02:46:38,827
[SPEAKER_06]: I find it very interesting how they've talked about this whole it's going to run 30 frames a second in 3D but it'll run 60 frames a second in 2D.

2253
02:46:40,169 --> 02:46:43,311
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a distinction I don't notice as much in like Super Street Fighter 4.

2254
02:46:43,511 --> 02:46:45,413
[SPEAKER_06]: It kind of looks the same no matter what mode you're in.

2255
02:46:46,394 --> 02:46:48,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you turn the 3D off in the options menu?

2256
02:46:48,595 --> 02:46:53,399
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if you turn the slider off, it'll still render the game in 30 frames per second.

2257
02:46:53,419 --> 02:47:01,606
[SPEAKER_04]: But when you turn the 3D option off in the options menu and you're playing like offline, it is absolutely gorgeous.

2258
02:47:02,267 --> 02:47:03,267
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't.

2259
02:47:03,668 --> 02:47:04,629
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to try that.

2260
02:47:04,709 --> 02:47:05,349
[SPEAKER_06]: What a good tip.

2261
02:47:05,429 --> 02:47:06,290
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad we do this show.

2262
02:47:06,310 --> 02:47:07,471
[SPEAKER_06]: See, even I learn shit on this show.

2263
02:47:07,851 --> 02:47:08,351
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I haven't.

2264
02:47:08,372 --> 02:47:09,072
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to try that.

2265
02:47:10,093 --> 02:47:10,393
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

2266
02:47:10,593 --> 02:47:11,554
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe that's what I'm missing.

2267
02:47:12,294 --> 02:47:14,656
[SPEAKER_06]: That's going to run very fluid when I try that.

2268
02:47:14,676 --> 02:47:15,096
[SPEAKER_06]: That's cool.

2269
02:47:16,297 --> 02:47:26,905
[SPEAKER_04]: The 60 frames doesn't carry over to the online portion, unfortunately, but if you're playing the arcade mode or versus mode or whatever, it's just gorgeous.

2270
02:47:27,045 --> 02:47:32,089
[SPEAKER_06]: Real quick, before we let you go, because we've got to fit in at least one more call tonight, have you had any luck with the Street Pass in Super Street Fighter 4?

2271
02:47:32,950 --> 02:47:36,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a bit, and I've been carrying that thing with me almost constantly.

2272
02:47:36,692 --> 02:47:44,035
[SPEAKER_04]: I live near Nashville, and there's a ton of stores around here, Best Buy and GameStop and stuff like that.

2273
02:47:44,055 --> 02:47:46,736
[SPEAKER_04]: I have not had one street pass fight with it.

2274
02:47:46,796 --> 02:47:47,356
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

2275
02:47:47,396 --> 02:47:50,317
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm hearing those things aren't activating very much, and it could be a variety of things.

2276
02:47:50,337 --> 02:47:52,098
[SPEAKER_06]: It could be that the battery life is so eh.

2277
02:47:52,558 --> 02:47:55,820
[SPEAKER_06]: on those things that it's not pulsing the StreetPass very often.

2278
02:47:55,860 --> 02:47:56,881
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of one thing I'm hearing.

2279
02:47:57,201 --> 02:48:01,304
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the other is just, you know, how many people carry their DS in sleep mode with them everywhere they go?

2280
02:48:01,364 --> 02:48:01,944
[SPEAKER_06]: Very few.

2281
02:48:03,045 --> 02:48:03,485
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know.

2282
02:48:03,505 --> 02:48:04,386
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to try this week.

2283
02:48:04,406 --> 02:48:07,448
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to try going to the mall this week and see if I get anybody on StreetPass.

2284
02:48:07,748 --> 02:48:08,929
[SPEAKER_06]: At least walk into GameStop.

2285
02:48:08,949 --> 02:48:10,870
[SPEAKER_06]: You know some of those employees have got to have it going.

2286
02:48:11,291 --> 02:48:11,691
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

2287
02:48:12,111 --> 02:48:19,956
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's where I got one of my StreetPass me's was GameStop and the other was like a demo unit of Best Buy.

2288
02:48:22,478 --> 02:48:24,579
[SPEAKER_06]: I never thought of trying a demo unit at Best Buy.

2289
02:48:24,599 --> 02:48:25,399
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a great idea.

2290
02:48:25,859 --> 02:48:26,280
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

2291
02:48:26,740 --> 02:48:30,201
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, Blue Swim, I've got to let you go so we can get more calls, but thanks for the call.

2292
02:48:30,842 --> 02:48:31,482
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.

2293
02:48:31,602 --> 02:48:32,102
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a good night.

2294
02:48:32,162 --> 02:48:32,562
[SPEAKER_06]: You too.

2295
02:48:32,902 --> 02:48:33,723
[SPEAKER_06]: Happy birthday, Jamie.

2296
02:48:34,183 --> 02:48:34,563
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

2297
02:48:35,884 --> 02:48:38,365
[SPEAKER_06]: See, I like enthusiastic callers.

2298
02:48:39,145 --> 02:48:40,365
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just really happy to be here.

2299
02:48:41,866 --> 02:48:42,366
[SPEAKER_06]: Exciting.

2300
02:48:42,947 --> 02:48:43,207
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

2301
02:48:44,387 --> 02:48:45,728
[SPEAKER_02]: I want more happy people.

2302
02:48:47,944 --> 02:48:49,906
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone, Blue Swim should be your role model.

2303
02:48:50,146 --> 02:48:50,466
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2304
02:48:51,327 --> 02:48:53,668
[SPEAKER_06]: Other stories that you've got, Salacious Popper.

2305
02:48:53,688 --> 02:48:55,570
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if you want to finish your thoughts on that last one.

2306
02:48:56,330 --> 02:49:07,719
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I was just saying that for the South Korea gaming curfew, that's a part of the world, not necessarily just South Korea, where people will just stop peeing when they play StarCraft II and then they die.

2307
02:49:07,859 --> 02:49:09,180
[SPEAKER_09]: Their bladder explodes and they die.

2308
02:49:09,300 --> 02:49:11,782
[SPEAKER_09]: So obviously I think there's a demand for that kind of regulation.

2309
02:49:12,301 --> 02:49:14,362
[SPEAKER_06]: I forgot to mention, I played some more StarCraft 2 this week.

2310
02:49:14,722 --> 02:49:17,663
[SPEAKER_06]: StarJeweled is my new favorite add-on ever for StarCraft.

2311
02:49:18,143 --> 02:49:18,643
[SPEAKER_06]: It's great.

2312
02:49:18,903 --> 02:49:23,144
[SPEAKER_06]: You play Bejeweled, and then you use the points you get in Bejeweled to, like, buy units.

2313
02:49:23,484 --> 02:49:24,705
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's like a tug-of-war match.

2314
02:49:24,925 --> 02:49:25,245
[SPEAKER_06]: Fun.

2315
02:49:25,405 --> 02:49:26,225
[SPEAKER_06]: It's awesome.

2316
02:49:26,425 --> 02:49:30,507
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, Jamie, you might actually like StarCraft 2 if I were to buy that.

2317
02:49:30,947 --> 02:49:31,247
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

2318
02:49:31,267 --> 02:49:33,367
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, I'm here.

2319
02:49:33,988 --> 02:49:34,228
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm here.

2320
02:49:35,268 --> 02:49:35,508
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm here.

2321
02:49:35,948 --> 02:49:37,709
[SPEAKER_06]: You gotta fix that.

2322
02:49:38,089 --> 02:49:40,210
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know why, but I'm hearing myself come through.

2323
02:49:40,410 --> 02:49:41,390
[SPEAKER_06]: You gotta fix your settings.

2324
02:49:42,113 --> 02:49:43,074
[SPEAKER_02]: But thank you for the bags.

2325
02:49:44,955 --> 02:49:47,256
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, we'll see.

2326
02:49:47,316 --> 02:49:48,817
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe he'll fix that and try calling back.

2327
02:49:48,837 --> 02:49:51,298
[SPEAKER_02]: Which nobody else but the people in this room and he will get.

2328
02:49:51,318 --> 02:49:56,300
[SPEAKER_06]: 1-877-GAME-OLR Username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2329
02:49:56,681 --> 02:49:58,602
[SPEAKER_06]: Echo123 is always a good way to text us.

2330
02:49:58,662 --> 02:50:01,063
[SPEAKER_06]: That's somebody who calls us pretty regularly though, so I don't know what's going on.

2331
02:50:01,697 --> 02:50:04,939
[SPEAKER_09]: Quick last minute story, Minecraft has two million paid.

2332
02:50:06,319 --> 02:50:07,960
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck, that's a game I still haven't played.

2333
02:50:08,020 --> 02:50:08,500
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you believe it?

2334
02:50:08,520 --> 02:50:14,943
[SPEAKER_09]: Two million people have paid for the beta access, which is roughly 28, 29% of its entire user base.

2335
02:50:15,784 --> 02:50:24,707
[SPEAKER_09]: So a little under a third of their player base has paid for the game for a little indie sandbox kind of Aspie thing.

2336
02:50:24,728 --> 02:50:25,568
[SPEAKER_09]: That's pretty impressive.

2337
02:50:26,007 --> 02:50:45,582
[SPEAKER_06]: you know some are saying it's too early to call Portal 2 the game of the year when you have something like Minecraft out there it has that same 3D with the weird spritey problem I can't play it for very long I need to check it out we need to play Minecraft we need to have a Minecraft night try to figure out why people lose their shit over this game

2338
02:50:45,822 --> 02:50:52,371
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's 15 euros, which translates to like 20 bucks or 22 bucks US because the euros are worth more than the dollar.

2339
02:50:52,611 --> 02:50:52,851
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2340
02:50:53,532 --> 02:50:54,654
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember being like 19.

2341
02:50:55,274 --> 02:50:56,356
[SPEAKER_06]: They have a demo though, right?

2342
02:50:56,556 --> 02:50:59,480
[SPEAKER_06]: Can't you play it for, isn't there like demo levels?

2343
02:50:59,540 --> 02:51:00,141
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got it.

2344
02:51:00,581 --> 02:51:00,842
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you?

2345
02:51:00,942 --> 02:51:01,723
[SPEAKER_02]: The demo somewhere.

2346
02:51:01,843 --> 02:51:02,083
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2347
02:51:02,184 --> 02:51:02,484
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on.

2348
02:51:02,644 --> 02:51:02,985
[SPEAKER_02]: I want it.

2349
02:51:04,266 --> 02:51:12,111
[SPEAKER_06]: 1-877-GAME-OLR I'm going to try keeping it open one more second, especially if that last guy can get their thing fixed.

2350
02:51:12,151 --> 02:51:12,692
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm so bad.

2351
02:51:12,732 --> 02:51:13,272
[SPEAKER_06]: I always forget.

2352
02:51:13,292 --> 02:51:15,173
[SPEAKER_06]: I still have Ragnarok online.

2353
02:51:15,854 --> 02:51:16,394
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

2354
02:51:16,854 --> 02:51:20,597
[SPEAKER_06]: An obvious spam person out of Bulgaria wants to be our friend.

2355
02:51:21,137 --> 02:51:21,638
[SPEAKER_06]: Block.

2356
02:51:23,679 --> 02:51:24,340
[SPEAKER_06]: That's no fun.

2357
02:51:24,360 --> 02:51:26,321
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, we're going to try this one more time.

2358
02:51:26,381 --> 02:51:27,482
[SPEAKER_06]: Give this guy one more chance here.

2359
02:51:27,842 --> 02:51:28,723
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go back to the phones.

2360
02:51:28,743 --> 02:51:29,984
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's still echoing.

2361
02:51:32,635 --> 02:51:32,895
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello?

2362
02:51:33,436 --> 02:51:33,816
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello?

2363
02:51:34,277 --> 02:51:35,077
[SPEAKER_06]: Now I'm not hearing you.

2364
02:51:35,237 --> 02:51:35,978
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay, you fixed it.

2365
02:51:35,998 --> 02:51:37,499
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I wasn't doing it before.

2366
02:51:37,559 --> 02:51:39,561
[SPEAKER_08]: You hung up, and I was like, okay, that's kind of weird.

2367
02:51:39,581 --> 02:51:41,282
[SPEAKER_08]: And I tried Echo, and Echo came out fine.

2368
02:51:41,502 --> 02:51:41,883
[SPEAKER_06]: That's weird.

2369
02:51:41,903 --> 02:51:42,683
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, it works now.

2370
02:51:42,703 --> 02:51:43,304
[SPEAKER_06]: What's on your mind, buddy?

2371
02:51:44,283 --> 02:51:45,184
[SPEAKER_08]: By the way, this is X-Link.

2372
02:51:45,224 --> 02:51:45,884
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, X-Link.

2373
02:51:46,004 --> 02:51:46,445
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

2374
02:51:47,185 --> 02:51:48,346
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's quite all right.

2375
02:51:48,486 --> 02:51:50,227
[SPEAKER_06]: I recognize your voice at this point.

2376
02:51:50,287 --> 02:51:51,448
[SPEAKER_06]: What's on your mind, buddy?

2377
02:51:51,848 --> 02:51:53,469
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, actually, it was kind of funny.

2378
02:51:53,669 --> 02:52:03,875
[SPEAKER_08]: Another caller kind of talked about this earlier, but the whole Val thing in Portal 2, I was watching the whole thing as it unfolded right before Portal 2 came out, the ARG.

2379
02:52:05,976 --> 02:52:14,303
[SPEAKER_08]: and it's kind of cool reading the stories of how Valve gave pretty much open access to these indie companies.

2380
02:52:14,423 --> 02:52:16,444
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically telling, hey, you wanna be part of this?

2381
02:52:16,564 --> 02:52:25,071
[SPEAKER_08]: Come on in, we'll give you full access, we'll help you any way possible, we'll give you all these materials, we'll do anything we can to make this work.

2382
02:52:25,271 --> 02:52:33,738
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was really cool reading some of the company stories of how everything progressed from day one to the night of,

2383
02:52:34,838 --> 02:52:50,627
[SPEAKER_06]: The release of when everything got completed Is that the whole thing I heard at the tail end of Bobby's show Where there's like an iPad app that Jeff Keighley was involved with Where they've like chronicled the entire last development cycle of Portal Is that what you're talking about?

2384
02:52:50,687 --> 02:53:00,332
[SPEAKER_08]: Most likely yes And I don't know exactly what the app has in it Because I don't have it right now And I don't have the money for it So I can't really tell

2385
02:53:01,592 --> 02:53:20,289
[SPEAKER_06]: The impression that I'm getting from our pal Bobby, who talked about it a little bit more on his show tonight, is that it's basically like, imagine an interactive news article, or I should say magazine feature, because it's more like a 10,000 word article or something like that, that has videos, pictures, behind the scenes stuff.

2386
02:53:21,598 --> 02:53:21,918
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably.

2387
02:53:22,639 --> 02:53:27,122
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it kind of sounds like honestly what more magazines ought to be doing on the iPad.

2388
02:53:27,682 --> 02:53:28,383
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

2389
02:53:29,383 --> 02:53:41,532
[SPEAKER_08]: And how all these people, these groups of people don't know each other and are willing going, hey, I have a free copy of AudioSurf I'm willing to give to you so that way you get your potatoes so that way we can make the multiplier faster so we can

2390
02:53:42,653 --> 02:53:47,576
[SPEAKER_08]: It was very cool seeing everybody come together, the squad going, okay, which game should we play?

2391
02:53:47,616 --> 02:53:51,599
[SPEAKER_08]: We should play this one so this way the timer can go down more and more and more.

2392
02:53:51,759 --> 02:53:55,902
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was just very neat watching the whole thing as it unfolded.

2393
02:53:55,982 --> 02:53:56,743
[SPEAKER_08]: It was very cool.

2394
02:53:57,683 --> 02:54:18,941
[SPEAKER_06]: that is yeah I'm I did I did play I did my part I played audio surf it was fun even though I had no intention of buying it on PC because I knew I'd already had the PS3 one ordered but it was still it was you know it's fun I like those things kind of get the community riled up like that and Valve is a heck of a company that's that's really what it boils down to I mean they does has Valve ever put out a bad game

2395
02:54:19,730 --> 02:54:21,872
[SPEAKER_06]: No, not that I know of.

2396
02:54:22,112 --> 02:54:26,596
[SPEAKER_06]: Valve is in a very elite group of developers that just does not put out bad games.

2397
02:54:26,656 --> 02:54:29,219
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would say Blizzard's probably in there too.

2398
02:54:29,699 --> 02:54:32,361
[SPEAKER_06]: Blizzard I don't think has ever put out a bad game until Cataclysm.

2399
02:54:32,461 --> 02:54:33,222
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

2400
02:54:34,043 --> 02:54:36,825
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, let's see, what else?

2401
02:54:36,845 --> 02:54:38,267
[SPEAKER_06]: There's got to be at least one other.

2402
02:54:38,807 --> 02:54:39,788
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure there's many folks.

2403
02:54:40,108 --> 02:54:44,913
[SPEAKER_09]: BioWare has a pedigree, but that's... Then you're getting to the more...

2404
02:54:45,733 --> 02:54:49,934
[SPEAKER_06]: See, part of me would say, well, Bethesda, because they put out such awesome stuff.

2405
02:54:49,954 --> 02:54:53,215
[SPEAKER_06]: But then I'm like, oh, but they did that Star Trek game that was really not good.

2406
02:54:53,835 --> 02:55:00,517
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, a lot of developers do have little blemishes on their record or bizarre creations before they close.

2407
02:55:00,557 --> 02:55:02,458
[SPEAKER_06]: But they made that Bond game that wasn't so hot.

2408
02:55:02,538 --> 02:55:03,898
[SPEAKER_06]: So unfortunately, they had a blemish, too.

2409
02:55:04,418 --> 02:55:09,120
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, so but there's very rare companies in the mid-market, depending on what the people want at the time.

2410
02:55:09,180 --> 02:55:09,680
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I mean.

2411
02:55:10,560 --> 02:55:11,821
[SPEAKER_08]: and it depends on who does it too.

2412
02:55:11,941 --> 02:55:15,002
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of it depends on how much work they put into it.

2413
02:55:15,022 --> 02:55:21,864
[SPEAKER_08]: If they're gonna put it in work for six months, they throw it out there in the market and expect it to sell and it turns out to be a complete piece of shit.

2414
02:55:21,904 --> 02:55:23,284
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't really get too much from it.

2415
02:55:23,504 --> 02:55:30,286
[SPEAKER_08]: It's obvious they took a lot of time and effort behind what they want and it really paid off.

2416
02:55:30,426 --> 02:55:31,667
[SPEAKER_08]: It paid off in big time.

2417
02:55:33,197 --> 02:55:37,461
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I said before, people were very happy with this whole thing and the way it unfolded at the end.

2418
02:55:37,741 --> 02:55:39,923
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, of course, with Portal 2 being the way it is.

2419
02:55:40,964 --> 02:55:44,007
[SPEAKER_06]: Kaijudo in our chatroom says, Valve put out that shitty poker game.

2420
02:55:44,367 --> 02:55:45,668
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe that was Telltale, wasn't it?

2421
02:55:46,169 --> 02:55:48,230
[SPEAKER_08]: That was Telltale, and it's not really that bad.

2422
02:55:48,371 --> 02:55:49,432
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really fun.

2423
02:55:49,772 --> 02:55:50,913
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a budget title.

2424
02:55:51,013 --> 02:55:53,655
[SPEAKER_08]: The budget title is really short, and I kind of wish they would add...

2425
02:55:57,495 --> 02:56:04,079
[SPEAKER_08]: And telltales about in that pedigree too I mean it kind of depends how into the games they're putting out you are But they put out a lot of quality stuff too

2426
02:56:16,386 --> 02:56:16,586
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

2427
02:56:16,947 --> 02:56:22,153
[SPEAKER_06]: So anyway, sorry, I don't want to turn this into a developer penis size contest, but you know, I thought it would be fun.

2428
02:56:22,173 --> 02:56:33,087
[SPEAKER_08]: And the gearbox and the gearbox is very interesting to that whole story about the proposal to you should watch both the videos first the video of the proposal and then how they all came about because

2429
02:56:33,587 --> 02:56:33,887
[SPEAKER_08]: and so on.

2430
02:56:56,949 --> 02:56:57,849
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, wow, I didn't even know that.

2431
02:56:58,510 --> 02:57:00,971
[SPEAKER_09]: Something Force with the Marine, Adrian Shepard.

2432
02:57:01,011 --> 02:57:04,513
[SPEAKER_09]: But the Half-Life expansions that came out in 98, 99, that was Gearbox.

2433
02:57:05,833 --> 02:57:06,293
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there you go.

2434
02:57:06,774 --> 02:57:10,375
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, X-Link, I got to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but any other quick final thoughts?

2435
02:57:10,916 --> 02:57:11,876
[SPEAKER_08]: No, that's about it.

2436
02:57:11,916 --> 02:57:13,397
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry about the call earlier.

2437
02:57:13,457 --> 02:57:14,177
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry about all that.

2438
02:57:14,197 --> 02:57:15,458
[SPEAKER_08]: I usually don't have any of those problems.

2439
02:57:15,498 --> 02:57:17,579
[SPEAKER_08]: I usually call Echo 1, 2, 3 beforehand.

2440
02:57:17,699 --> 02:57:18,819
[SPEAKER_06]: Minus 50 DKP.

2441
02:57:19,520 --> 02:57:20,620
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, no joke.

2442
02:57:20,780 --> 02:57:21,040
[SPEAKER_06]: Later.

2443
02:57:21,621 --> 02:57:21,861
[SPEAKER_08]: Later.

2444
02:57:22,697 --> 02:57:24,219
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

2445
02:57:24,239 --> 02:57:27,683
[SPEAKER_06]: If you didn't get through, help Jamie get tacos by sending an email instead.

2446
02:57:27,723 --> 02:57:32,228
[SPEAKER_06]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com How did I fucking agree to buy her fucking tacos?

2447
02:57:33,189 --> 02:57:33,930
[SPEAKER_02]: I am awesome.

2448
02:57:34,731 --> 02:57:35,011
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

2449
02:57:35,472 --> 02:57:37,354
[SPEAKER_06]: And Skype crashed right as I closed it.

2450
02:57:37,434 --> 02:57:37,755
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

2451
02:57:38,275 --> 02:57:38,516
[SPEAKER_06]: Heart.

2452
02:57:39,216 --> 02:57:39,436
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

2453
02:57:39,836 --> 02:57:40,096
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2454
02:57:40,356 --> 02:57:42,717
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's a sign that we need to wrap up the show and get on out of here.

2455
02:57:42,757 --> 02:57:46,458
[SPEAKER_06]: So we can't wrap up the show, though, until we go around and get some final thoughts.

2456
02:57:47,418 --> 02:57:50,078
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, actually, I should ask if you have any other quick last minute stories you want to get out.

2457
02:57:50,738 --> 02:57:51,058
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

2458
02:57:51,279 --> 02:57:51,659
[SPEAKER_06]: No, you're good.

2459
02:57:52,079 --> 02:57:52,259
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2460
02:57:52,279 --> 02:57:54,359
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, then I will say thank you very much for being here.

2461
02:57:54,499 --> 02:57:55,459
[SPEAKER_06]: Salacious Pop tonight.

2462
02:57:55,819 --> 02:57:58,640
[SPEAKER_06]: Really appreciate it, especially on short notice and filling in for Loki.

2463
02:57:58,660 --> 02:58:00,420
[SPEAKER_06]: You did a great job with the stories and everything.

2464
02:58:00,480 --> 02:58:01,441
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a very fun show.

2465
02:58:01,781 --> 02:58:04,481
[SPEAKER_06]: Not everybody can just waltz right in here and read the stories.

2466
02:58:04,521 --> 02:58:05,361
[SPEAKER_06]: So really appreciate it.

2467
02:58:05,381 --> 02:58:05,882
[SPEAKER_06]: Hope you had fun.

2468
02:58:05,982 --> 02:58:06,262
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

2469
02:58:06,562 --> 02:58:06,902
[SPEAKER_06]: As always.

2470
02:58:06,922 --> 02:58:08,222
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners?

2471
02:58:11,407 --> 02:58:15,089
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember to go outside and don't play too much Portal 2 and Mortal Kombat back to back.

2472
02:58:15,509 --> 02:58:15,889
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

2473
02:58:17,950 --> 02:58:20,311
[SPEAKER_06]: My final thought is now I want tacos.

2474
02:58:20,791 --> 02:58:21,271
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate you.

2475
02:58:21,791 --> 02:58:22,372
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't.

2476
02:58:22,392 --> 02:58:23,012
[SPEAKER_06]: You're right, I don't.

2477
02:58:24,393 --> 02:58:25,193
[SPEAKER_06]: But right now I do.

2478
02:58:26,253 --> 02:58:27,654
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, your final thought tonight.

2479
02:58:27,894 --> 02:58:28,594
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hungry.

2480
02:58:28,934 --> 02:58:29,975
[SPEAKER_02]: I want a taco.

2481
02:58:30,955 --> 02:58:32,356
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess that seems to be the theme tonight.

2482
02:58:32,856 --> 02:58:40,921
[SPEAKER_06]: Tune in next week when you'll find out where did we get tacos on the very informative episode 411 of Orange Launch Radio next week.

2483
02:58:40,941 --> 02:58:41,561
[SPEAKER_02]: See what I did there?

2484
02:58:41,581 --> 02:58:42,121
[SPEAKER_06]: See what I did there?

2485
02:58:42,141 --> 02:58:42,602
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2486
02:58:42,962 --> 02:58:46,464
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, if you like the show... If that's gonna go, then I hate to see episode 420.

2487
02:58:47,685 --> 02:58:52,087
[SPEAKER_06]: Which was supposed to land on our nine-year anniversary, but apparently they're off by like a week, so we'll see.

2488
02:58:52,107 --> 02:58:52,968
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, anyhow.

2489
02:58:53,729 --> 02:58:54,129
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

2490
02:59:09,328 --> 02:59:13,812
[SPEAKER_06]: All we ask you guys, if you like what you hear on the show, leave us a nice review on iTunes.

2491
02:59:13,912 --> 02:59:14,993
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell a friend about the show.

2492
02:59:15,313 --> 02:59:19,157
[SPEAKER_06]: Help us spread the word because we don't have a giant magazine company behind us.

2493
02:59:19,617 --> 02:59:24,241
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not getting paid $70,000 a year to do journalism or whatever.

2494
02:59:24,701 --> 02:59:25,742
[SPEAKER_06]: Just spread the word.
