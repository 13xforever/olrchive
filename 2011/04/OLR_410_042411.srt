Is EA Sports set to roll out a new paid subscription service?

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Child of Eden is delayed on one platform

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And could an upcoming paid demo determine the fate of Mega Man Legends 3?

Orange Lounge Radio

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet

00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
It's the show where every gamer has a voice

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
We tape live at All Games Radio

Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
My name is Rob Roberts

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-hosts

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
First up, the one and only

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
DarkSakura, Jamie Summers

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Hi

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
How are you?

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Feeling far better than I did previously

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Yes

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I can eat now

26
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm sorry to hear you were sick and all

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
What happened?

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
You just had a

29
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
No idea, I think it was just a bug

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
That's too bad

31
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
It had to have been a virus because nobody else got sick

32
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Do you feel refreshed after a week off?

33
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
We weren't here last week

34
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
And you were really the only one that didn't have anything going

35
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Well, I don't know if you ended up doing something else

36
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
But Lowkey's my fault

37
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I got to spend a good night with my boy

38
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Good, good

39
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Little date night

40
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
More of a hanging out

41
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
How cute

42
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Hey, I think we actually played some more Final Fantasy that night

43
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Oh, your little Final Fantasy megathon or whatever you're doing?

44
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Yeah, whenever we get back to it

45
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
We got the level up, the job change

46
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Okay, there you go

47
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Oh, so you're still on one

48
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
But you're now probably what, halfway through one

49
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Because that's about the halfway point of the game

50
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Little more maybe

51
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Yeah, cool, cool

52
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Well, I'm not here tonight sadly

53
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Techmaster Lowkey is not here

54
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I don't know, there's something about like

55
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Baby's first Easter

56
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
And all this like, I gotta do family stuff

57
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Like, whatever, nice excuse

58
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Alright, no, just kidding, obviously

59
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Understandable

60
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I can't wait until next year when they're all like

61
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
We've done all this, who cares

62
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
So sadly Lowkey is not here tonight

63
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
But filling in for Techmaster Lowkey

64
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Say hello to Salacious Pop

65
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Hello

66
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
How are you?

67
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'm great

68
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Thank you for coming here on kind of a short notice

69
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So, appreciate it

70
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
No, I live with you now

71
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
So you can just drag me out wherever

72
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Exactly, it's pretty easy

73
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I have to be honest, Salacious Pop

74
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It wasn't the first person I tried to get on here

75
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I know that sounds really horrible

76
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It's not, obviously he's a wonderful guest and so forth

77
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
But it's kind of like, you know, you try to bring on

78
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
A variety of folks

79
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
And unfortunately everybody else I asked

80
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Was like, ah, Easter

81
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
And I got Easter stuff going on

82
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Yeah, there's Easter things

83
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
It's like a big holiday or something

84
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
No, I guess it is for a lot of people

85
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
But I always thought Easter was kind of done in the morning

86
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Like, I finished Easter stuff in the morning today

87
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I had family stuff going on

88
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
But that was all in the morning, so

89
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I don't know

90
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Well, I mean, I think the real Easter experience is

91
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You get up and you go to church

92
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
So, if you're not going to mass, then

93
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Yeah, but

94
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You can make it up as you go along

95
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Mass is like at midnight or something, right?

96
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
So, you got plenty of time for OLR still, right?

97
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
No, I don't know

98
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Alright, forget it

99
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I'll quit being a heathen or whatever

100
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Anyway, let's introduce the chat room

101
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
They're always there

102
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Because really, Jesus died so you could have chocolate

103
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
chat.orangelaungeradio.com

104
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Marshmallow Peeps

105
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Eww

106
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
A chat.orangelaungeradio.com

107
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
You can chat live with us

108
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
here on tonight's program

109
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
And get your little piece in

110
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Whatever it is you want to say and so forth

111
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
We do have a handful of people in chat

112
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Despite the holiday

113
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Of course, it's a little less than usual

114
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
And in part, you can blame a week off

115
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Because, I'll tell you what

116
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Hoard House inadvertently had a week off as well

117
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
And I'll tell you what, died

118
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Forums died

119
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
It's like, if you do a podcast

120
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'll tell you what, here's the advice

121
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Because we get emails once in a while

122
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You know, how have you guys stuck with doing a podcast

123
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
For nine years to today?

124
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Do you have any advice?

125
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
You have my advice?

126
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Try never to take weeks off

127
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Unless you absolutely have to

128
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Because, unfortunately, folks will get out of the habit of listening to you

129
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
And it's over like that

130
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Alright, anyhow, we're back

131
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Hopefully you will find room for us

132
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
In your podcasting and listening schedule again

133
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
And we want to talk about video games

134
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Gaming news

135
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
We'll start it off as we always do with our gaming week

136
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

137
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I played a bunch of stuff

138
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Well, I played a lot of World of Warcraft

139
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
And two new games appeared in my steam account today

140
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
The Star Trek DAC

141
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
And Darwinia

142
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Which I have installed

143
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Just have not played

144
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Because I had an epic nap today

145
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
How could that have happened?

146
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I don't know, Rob

147
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Some Sky person sent it to me

148
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
And we had our Final Fantasy go on

149
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It's not like you had a birthday or anything happen during the hiatus

150
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
By the way, happy birthday

151
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Thank you

152
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Old lady

153
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Not old lady

154
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Just kidding

155
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I still got it

156
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Well, Tuesday we went to Dave and Buster's for my birthday

157
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Thank you guys for coming

158
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You're welcome

159
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
And I had a purple people eater

160
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Which I kind of regretted having

161
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Because that was when my stomach was starting to get really bad

162
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
But, um, we, uh

163
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I played some Derby Owners Club

164
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
And Tank Tank Tank

165
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
And some of that really awesome Terminator gun game

166
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
And this weird trivia game

167
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
That I really didn't know much of the answers to

168
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Because it was like sports

169
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
And pop culture

170
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Like, the type of pop culture that I don't keep up with

171
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
And, uh

172
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
What else did I play?

173
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Because I played other stuff

174
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I played Droplets

175
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
When I had my big bad insomnia attack last night

176
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Except all it really did was make me have to pee

177
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
And, uh

178
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Some, uh, Luminesse

179
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
And, uh

180
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
What else did I play?

181
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I played something else

182
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Oh, yeah, um, Peggle Extreme

183
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
And then watched an entire playthrough of Portal 2

184
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
You actually watched the whole thing start to finish, huh?

185
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Yes, I did

186
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Wow

187
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
See, I didn't want to ruin it for myself

188
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I did that with the last one, too

189
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Did you really?

190
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
That means now I'll have some idea

191
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
So how to play a little bit more seamlessly

192
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
So that I do not get too motion sick

193
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
So, um, do you find that if you kind of play the YouTubes in advance or whatever

194
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
That it helps the experience or hurts it?

195
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I think it helps it

196
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I've been trying very hard to dodge spoilers

197
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I have not beaten Portal 2 yet

198
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
And I'm really, like, everybody's like

199
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You gotta hear the song

200
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I'm like, doesn't the song have spoilers?

201
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
So

202
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Not really

203
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I mean, yeah, it does really give away the ending

204
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
But I'm trying really hard to avoid all that, so

205
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
You know

206
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Yeah

207
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
But I love it

208
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
My favorite thing so far is

209
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
BIRD KILL IT

210
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
So, uh, do you know that it's Noble Garden Week in WoW?

211
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Because you played some WoW, it's Easter

212
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Oh

213
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It's Easter holiday, it's one of the easier ones

214
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I didn't do that, I'll have to do it this week

215
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It's all this week, it just started today

216
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Okay

217
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It's Rob's favorite holiday

218
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Ugh

219
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
No, my favorite holiday is coming up next week in WoW

220
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It's Children's Week

221
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
And my favorite, I mean, ugh

222
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It's terrible

223
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
And it's the one holiday I need for my Violet Drake

224
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Because literally last year I said

225
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Fuck Children's Week, I'm not putting up with this bullshit

226
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Ugh, you gotta do it

227
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
And I had to wait an entire year

228
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Anyhow

229
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Well, let's

230
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I found, by the way, a dragon that I want

231
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
That's blue and has transparent wings, looks kind of aquatic

232
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
It might be one of those hard to get ones

233
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I know, but I want it

234
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Alright

235
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
It will be mine

236
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Let's move on with some other video games

237
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Salacious Pop, what'd you play this week?

238
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I've actually played a lot, considering that usually my schedule is simply WoW

239
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Which I'm playing far less of

240
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I played some Toki Tori

241
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Because it was a part of the Steam Potato Bag special

242
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I had already owned Toki Tori

243
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
So they just patched in the Potato Portal 2 content

244
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Because I wanted to try and unlock Portal 2 early

245
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Even though I didn't really have the means to buy it

246
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I still haven't really played Portal 2 yet

247
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
So Toki Tori Mortal Kombat

248
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Beat the story mode

249
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:09,000
And did some just regular one person versus PC fighting on that

250
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
And some Smash TV

251
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Some Fatal

252
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Going old school, what made you do Smash TV?

253
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Just when we were

254
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I was putting my Xbox Live account on your Xbox

255
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
And was trying to sync up all the games that you have on it

256
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
So I was just going through some old stuff on there

257
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,000
And yeah, that's it really

258
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
What did you think of Mortal Kombat?

259
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I wish the story mode was longer

260
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Because all the endless fighting

261
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
If there's even just a little bit of dialogue in between

262
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It'll hold my attention more

263
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Than just doing ladder mode

264
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
And getting up to the boss

265
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
And starting all over from scratch

266
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
But yeah, I liked it

267
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I found a lot of bugs in it

268
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Audio bugs

269
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
That hopefully they'll be able to patch and fix

270
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Once a certain system is back online

271
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Which we'll get into I'm sure in a minute

272
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
But yeah, it's fun

273
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
It's a good

274
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
They pretty much looked at what Street Fighter 4 did

275
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
And it's like, oh that's awesome

276
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
We should do that for our franchise

277
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
And it's working for them

278
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
It doesn't hurt that they've had a little bit of a break

279
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
With Midway having gone under

280
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
And somebody else had to pick up the series

281
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
So it kind of gave them a little time to think about how to reinvent

282
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Yeah, I think Warner Brothers

283
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I know Warner Brothers published it

284
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Well the Mortal Kombat folks I think broke off

285
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
And made this NetherRealm Studios

286
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Is their new little thing

287
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
And then Warner Brothers is their publisher

288
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
So you know, Mortal Kombat's

289
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Been a viable enough franchise

290
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I don't know how well the last few games in the series have sold

291
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Keep in mind the last game that came out

292
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Was the Mortal Kombat in DC Universe game

293
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I don't know how well that sold

294
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
But before that they were

295
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Cranking them out

296
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I think those games have always sold enough

297
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I don't know if they've ever sold big

298
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
And it really seems like they're trying to get this new one

299
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
In the series to sell big

300
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Because we had what?

301
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
We had Deadly Alliance

302
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
We had Annihilation

303
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
There was another one in the middle there

304
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
The one that had the Mortal Kombat mini racing

305
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Kart game was there too

306
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Annihilation was the one that had

307
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Literally everybody

308
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
That was kind of the last Mortal Kombat game

309
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
But then they're like, oh

310
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
How do you save a franchise? You do a reboot

311
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
And you know, that's literally what they've done

312
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Literally, like that's the story

313
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Is built around a reboot

314
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Yeah, the story mode

315
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
If you play it from start to finish

316
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Does the canon

317
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
The official canon of the first three games

318
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
And it sets you up for what

319
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Mortal Kombat 4 was, lore wise

320
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
At the end of the story mode

321
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Let's go to our chatroom

322
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
At chat.orangesonstrader.com for some comments

323
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Tigerclaw in our chatroom says

324
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
The MK story mode is long if you take into account

325
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
How difficult it was to beat Shao Kahn

326
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
The best strategy was to

327
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Teleport, uppercut, repeat that and stay

328
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Far away until time expires

329
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Yeah, I did some lightning ball cheese on him

330
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Just get away, pew pew

331
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I'm gonna pew pew at you

332
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
And then he just hopefully doesn't block enough of him to win

333
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Because the thing about story mode is that you have

334
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
To play as pretty much every character

335
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Or do you play every character?

336
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Only the human side really

337
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
You don't play the outworld

338
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
And netherworld people

339
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
But you still have to play a pretty good mix of people

340
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Yeah, Sonya, Jax

341
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Most of Raiden's little groupies

342
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Are who you control

343
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
And Tigerclaw in our chatroom also fills in here with

344
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Rob, it's like what they did with Star Trek

345
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Due to the events of the beginning

346
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
It creates an alternate timeline

347
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I don't think that's very spoilery

348
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I think that's pretty common knowledge

349
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
In story mode, I believe people die

350
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I haven't gotten that far in my story mode

351
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
But I believe people do die

352
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I don't want to spoil that for you

353
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
But there's big twists and events

354
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I believe characters become characters that didn't exist before

355
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Kind of interesting

356
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Back in the 90s when MK2 and MK3 were out

357
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Baraka wasn't in MK3

358
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Because in the canon

359
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
He died at the end of 2

360
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
They don't show that and obviously you can still play as him

361
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
In this new reboot

362
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
So they left out some of the deaths

363
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
So the official canon is in there

364
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
That's cool

365
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Going into my gaming week

366
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Obviously I played Mortal Kombat

367
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Pretty extensively this week as well

368
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I do like how they have

369
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Really brought a lot of the nostalgia

370
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I think you commenting

371
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
What Street Fighter 2 did

372
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
We should do that

373
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Or Street Fighter 4 did for Street Fighter 2

374
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
We should do that

375
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Is almost exactly what they've done

376
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
A lot of that has the nostalgia of the different stages

377
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
And I really like how in story mode

378
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
The very first part of story mode

379
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Takes place in a stage

380
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
That you see in the original Mortal Kombat

381
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
With Shang Tsung sitting up on the throne

382
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
And all the monks sitting in front of him

383
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
That applaud

384
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
They literally bring that to life

385
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
In this new Mortal Kombat game

386
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
And that's pretty cool to watch

387
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
That's something I don't really remember happening in Street Fighter

388
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
So kind of getting to see all that play out

389
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
With, I hate saying next gen graphics

390
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
But you know

391
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Or ten years later technology

392
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Updated

393
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Graphics and effects is really cool

394
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Kind of watch all that play out

395
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Did you bring it?

396
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I didn't bring it tonight

397
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I'm sorry I didn't know you wanted to play it

398
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I've been watching all of the fatalities

399
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
And the special unlock characters and everything

400
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
And I found out where all of the hidden coins are

401
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Yeah there's a little guide online

402
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
That we use to get every costume

403
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
If you don't

404
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Buy any of the extras

405
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
In the crypt and you just do story mode

406
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
From start to finish

407
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
You have 130,000

408
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Of the MK coins

409
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
That's enough to get almost half of the goodies

410
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
It's enough to get all the costumes and the fatalities

411
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
That's cool because I think that there's like

412
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Another hidden 20,000

413
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Yeah

414
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I'm being corrected by our chat room

415
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Annihilation was the movie

416
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Armageddon was the game

417
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
My bad, my bad, sorry guys

418
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Thanks Spaznator

419
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
A comment from Randy in our chat room

420
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I felt like the story mode cleared up the events of the franchise

421
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
It was definitely more confusing before

422
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Yeah you know Mortal Kombat

423
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Kind of always felt like one of those games

424
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Where they had to kind of write the story

425
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
To fit what they wanted to do

426
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
And so there were all these weird things going on

427
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
But yeah I kind of agree

428
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
That what they've done with this little reboot

429
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I mean granted although they're changing some things

430
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
It kind of makes a lot of stuff make more sense

431
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
All in all as far as for the game itself

432
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
And this is interesting because

433
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
When I did the demo a couple weeks ago

434
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I think I expressed concern

435
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Like I'm not sure I'm going to like this game

436
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Well just goes to show

437
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Don't ever base your opinion of a game off the demo

438
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Don't ever ever ever do that

439
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Because it was actually really good

440
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
And I've been having a good time with it

441
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I think there's such a great variety in characters

442
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
That they've brought in

443
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Pretty much every single fighter from 1, 2, and 3

444
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Are in it right

445
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
With maybe some very minor like the boss characters

446
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Not all of them are there

447
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
When I was going through the list I saw that

448
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Kentaro, Goro

449
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Shiva

450
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I think they all show up in the story

451
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
But they had fatalities for him

452
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Oh really?

453
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
The big centaur dude with the big horse

454
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I think he was the boss of MK3

455
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
He's in it in a cutscene but you don't play as him

456
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
And then Quan Chi from before

457
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Was brought in so he's playable

458
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
But otherwise the people from 4 aren't in it yet

459
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Yeah although

460
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
DLC might change some of that

461
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
There's a character that was introduced in Deadly Alliance

462
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Who's actually one of my favorite characters

463
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Kenshi is one of the first download characters

464
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
The blind ninja guy

465
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
There's a lot of people calling for Tanya to show up

466
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I would love Tanya to be in the game

467
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
She's awesome

468
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
She wasn't a major character though

469
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
She was a bitch

470
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
So I'm not expecting her to show up

471
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
But it would be cool if she would

472
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
And then I was watching the fatalities

473
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
For Kratos

474
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Kratos is in the game

475
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
He obviously fits right in

476
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I gotta say though

477
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
He plays like any other character

478
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Which I think is a compliment

479
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
You don't want a character like Kratos

480
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
To be gimmicky or stick out like a sore thumb

481
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
But I mean the whole

482
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Painting his body white and everything

483
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Well Quan Chi does that shit too

484
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
So he kind of fits right in with everybody else

485
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
It's a better promotional exclusive thing

486
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Than I don't know Darth Vader and Yoda

487
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
And Soul Calibur IV

488
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
And also the other thing

489
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
That

490
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Who was it?

491
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I just lost my train of thought

492
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
It was somebody else that's in there

493
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Well Noob and

494
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Ermac were

495
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Fandom rumors

496
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
That they actually made real characters

497
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I love that

498
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Ermac's fatality with the spikes

499
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
That one's really cool

500
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Leo Shen is in our chat room saying

501
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
No Rain otherwise they would have all of Trilogy

502
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Yeah Rain is one of the most notable

503
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Notable characters that's missing but

504
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
To be honest because they've done so

505
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Much with the other ninjas like

506
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Cyrax and Sektor are not

507
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Just palette swaps

508
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
They are fully developed

509
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
They start in story mode as humans

510
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
And you can unlock their human forms

511
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
So they are all very different characters

512
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
So I can see why they probably cut

513
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Rain because while he was a cool

514
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Character especially he was really

515
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Tacked into Trilogy I think

516
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
He was purple Rain

517
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
He was a palette swap that had a couple cool moves

518
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
With a neat name

519
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Otherwise he was really

520
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Forced in the story

521
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I would bet he's DLC later on though

522
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I remember what I was going to say

523
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
One of Shang Tsung's fatalities was actually

524
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
His mortal combat

525
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Versus DC fatality

526
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Except it's the whole thing

527
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Because they cut it to where you only see him

528
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Turn into a clown

529
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
And then you don't see the other person explode

530
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
They showed the full fatality

531
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Because people were like what happened

532
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
So they actually put that in there

533
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
The fatalities in this game are a little silly

534
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
As they're supposed to be very over the top

535
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Babalities are in there

536
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Babalities are cute

537
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
But friendships are not which kind of surprised me

538
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I was very sad

539
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
No animalities or any of the other weird stuff either

540
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I was really sad friendships weren't there

541
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I always loved those in Mortal Combat 2

542
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Otherwise the game is pretty fast paced

543
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
It's got a great tutorial mode

544
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
That kind of teaches you how to do things like

545
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
The x-ray attacks are a really neat addition

546
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
It does feel a little lifted

547
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
From Street Fighter 4

548
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
It's one of those things where it's like

549
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
It's not a copy

550
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
But it's definitely influenced

551
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
But it's really cool

552
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
It adds to the battle exactly what it does

553
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
In Street Fighter 4

554
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
If you are behind this gives you a chance to level the playing field

555
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
If your opponent has a moment of weakness

556
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
And the x-ray attacks look really cool

557
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
And it makes the battle flow really well

558
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
And I think that's where this game really shines

559
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Is that just the battles

560
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Flow so well

561
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
They're fun to play

562
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
The fatalities give that

563
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Sense of edge to it

564
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
There's a lot at stake

565
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Where this Mortal Combat

566
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Really shines is where a lot of the

567
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Prior Mortal Combat games have really shined

568
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
And that is the

569
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Robustness of what is offered

570
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
In the title

571
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
You've got your story mode

572
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
You've got your challenge ladder

573
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
You've got the crypt thing

574
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Which the crypt thing has been done better

575
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
In other versions of the game I think

576
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
But whatever it's still there

577
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
You have different modes to play

578
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
And the tag team thing

579
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Kind of comes out of nowhere too

580
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
They kind of took that whole idea

581
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I guess you could say Marvel vs Capcom or whatever

582
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
But now you have teams of two

583
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
And you can do assists and all that stuff

584
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
So it's pretty cool

585
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Mortal Combat has really been invigorated

586
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
It's been infused with some of the best parts

587
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
For a pretty awesome experience

588
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
One of my favorite Mortal Combat games in recent memory

589
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
The best one of all time

590
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I think that's still two

591
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
It's one of those that

592
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
That's going to be hard to top

593
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
It's worth

594
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Checking out if nothing else

595
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
A lot of people like to point and laugh at Mortal Combat

596
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
In the fighting world

597
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
But I think this one shows that there's a lot here to take seriously

598
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Two Beta was great

599
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
With Katana's infinite combo

600
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Let's see

601
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Tigerclaw in our chatroom says

602
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Rob regarding animalities at least one of them is in there

603
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
It's one of Liu Kang's fatalities

604
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
That's true

605
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
But wasn't it also a fatality in Mortal Combat 2

606
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I think that's what inspired it

607
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Not necessarily the animalities

608
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Anyhow, other games I played this week

609
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I don't want to talk just about Mortal Combat

610
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Because I haven't had a chance to play Mortal Combat online

611
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Because of certain outages

612
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
But I have had a chance to check out Portal 2

613
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Portal 2 is

614
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I played the first game

615
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
And played that game pretty extensively

616
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
And it was always a pretty cool concept

617
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
And when I heard they were making a sequel

618
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I knew it was going to be pretty interesting

619
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
And I've been playing through the single player mode

620
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
And I really don't know what to say

621
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I honestly think

622
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Games like

623
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Super Mario Brothers

624
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Final Fantasy 7

625
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Games that have been

626
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Landmark for that generation

627
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I honestly think Portal 2 fits into that

628
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
For this generation

629
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I think this is like a

630
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Legendary status of a game

631
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Honestly

632
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
It really just took the first one

633
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
And it's like, wow, people kind of like this idea

634
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
And this concept

635
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
We're just going to, again, infuse all this new stuff into it

636
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
And it's just given it all this energy

637
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
And now a story that's really taken off on its own

638
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
And all these different concepts

639
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I mean, I really think

640
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
This game is going to just stand the test of time

641
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
As this is really a great game

642
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
That's really easy to get into

643
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
It's a first person shooter for people who hate first person shooters

644
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
That's one of the

645
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Really interesting things about it

646
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
And the story is well done, the voice acting is

647
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Phenomenal

648
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
And then there's a co-op mode on top of all of that

649
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
And I think it's just

650
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
A great game

651
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I really try to keep myself spoiler free

652
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
And I've been very happy with some of the twists and turns

653
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
That the story has been taking

654
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I was really expecting it to just be

655
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Kind of a continuation of Portal 1

656
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Where you would just have more test chambers

657
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
And explore the story a little more

658
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
But there's much more here

659
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Than just more test chambers

660
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
And that's all I'm really going to say

661
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Although there are a lot of those

662
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
There are a lot of those

663
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
But there's much more

664
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
This game digs beneath the surface

665
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
And I don't just mean beneath the surface

666
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Of the test chambers

667
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Which you do get to see as well

668
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Which is really cool

669
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
GLaDOS as a character

670
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Is legendary

671
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Where are you right now?

672
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
In the world of video games

673
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I have done the blue repulsion gel

674
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
A couple times

675
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
So you've seen Potato?

676
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I have seen Potato

677
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Okay, I'm trying to figure out where you are

678
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
So I get where the Potato Sack joke comes from now

679
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
That didn't occur to me until later

680
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
But yes, so I get where that all comes from

681
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
My favorite still is

682
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
BIRD KILL IT

683
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
So yeah

684
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
And I have to say I was reading on a few things

685
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
And you know where you see

686
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
All the old potatoes

687
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
The bring your daughter to work

688
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Day science fair

689
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
The big mutated potato

690
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Is supposed to be Shell's project

691
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Interesting

692
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Interesting

693
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Alright

694
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
So anyway

695
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Some comments in our chat room

696
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Randy in our chat room says

697
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Watching Portal for the first time made me think

698
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
How does someone have the mental capacity to figure out these puzzles

699
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
You know a lot of it is trial and error

700
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I noticed that the second game

701
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Really limits where you can put portals

702
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
More than the first game did

703
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
And that's part of the puzzles

704
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
They've added all this other stuff into it

705
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Like the lasers

706
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
The gel is a huge thing

707
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I got stuck on one puzzle

708
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Because of that stupid gel

709
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I couldn't figure out how to

710
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
I didn't figure out that you could actually make gel

711
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Fly through the walls that destroy things

712
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Otherwise I would have figured it out a lot sooner

713
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
And just crazy stuff

714
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
You really have to look around for surfaces

715
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
That could be a mile high up

716
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
For you to fling a portal onto

717
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
It is really an experience

718
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
To play a game like Portal

719
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
And I really don't know what else to say

720
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
The game is outstanding

721
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
And it's well worth your money

722
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
If you haven't bought it yet

723
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
I guess you already know this is probably the type of game

724
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
That maybe just isn't for you for whatever reason

725
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Or you know obviously economical whatever stuff

726
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
60 bucks is still a huge investment

727
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
But I don't know what else to say

728
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I think most people who want it

729
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Already went and got it first day

730
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
The Steam integration is great

731
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
I was really surprised at how well

732
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Steam integrates with the Playstation 3

733
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
But you can hit select

734
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
And it's just like being logged into Steam

735
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
I don't know what else to say

736
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
It was pretty seamless

737
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
You connect your Playstation network account

738
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
To Steam

739
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
And then that's it

740
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
You can hit select and I can see all my Steam friends

741
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
And who's on

742
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
And it's just like I'm playing another Steam game

743
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
But it's on my Playstation 3

744
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Now I was wondering

745
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
If someone picked this up

746
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
They wouldn't be able to get the Steam

747
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Link would they?

748
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
There is a card

749
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
That comes with the game

750
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
That has the code on it

751
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
So sadly no you wouldn't be able to get it

752
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
You'd have to buy it new in order to get to both games

753
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
And it says somehow

754
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
It says on the back of the box

755
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
You cannot play co-op

756
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
On your PC and PS3

757
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
But I don't know

758
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
See I haven't really explored that yet

759
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Maybe somebody in our chat knows

760
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
And I would imagine a lot of that is because of the Steam hookup

761
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
If I log into Steam on my PS3

762
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
It's not going to let me do it on my PC as well

763
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
To play the same game

764
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
But what would happen if I have two

765
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Playstation 3 accounts

766
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Like for example, Salacious Pop uses my Playstation

767
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
3 as well

768
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
What if he connected that to his Steam

769
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
And then played on my PS3

770
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
And then I played Steam on my computer

771
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Maybe that would work? I don't know

772
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Because I can't imagine that the discs are imprinted with the serial numbers somehow

773
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
So unless

774
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Hooking up Steam

775
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
And hooking up the whole console

776
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
To that Steam ID

777
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
I would think you could have that

778
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I don't know

779
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I'm going to be honest

780
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I haven't even really played it on Steam

781
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
I've been completely satiated with the PS3 version

782
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
I don't really need the Steam version

783
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
It's nice to have

784
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
It's a cool little bonus

785
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
But I didn't really need it

786
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
I'm waiting until I can play it on PC

787
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Because I'm like that

788
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I need the mouse in WASD

789
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
It really is a lot easier to play on the PC

790
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
See but see

791
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
This all goes back to joystick vs mouse and keyboard

792
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Some people prefer mouse and keyboard

793
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
I love the DualShock controller

794
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
For playing it, it's awesome

795
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Great for me

796
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Spazzinator in our chat room says

797
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Is the cake still a lie in Portal 2?

798
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
No

799
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
There is one joke that is

800
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Blink and you miss it sort of thing

801
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
And I like that they did that

802
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Because they didn't try to keep the same joke

803
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Going through the whole thing

804
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
I really like that

805
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Glados has some new insults and some of them are real good

806
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
She consistently makes fat jokes about you

807
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Which are just outstanding

808
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
I love the Glados cut downs

809
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Some of them are really harsh

810
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
All I'll say

811
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
The surprise?

812
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
When the confetti blows

813
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
I was dying

814
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Alright

815
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Next time there will be real confetti

816
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Let's see

817
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Go into our chatroom at chat.orangelaungeradio.com

818
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Let's see

819
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Bonds006 says

820
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Like the Xbox 360 recovery game tag ability?

821
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
From Sony?

822
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
No Rob, stop hoping

823
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
I don't think that's exactly what I'm talking about

824
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Although, yeah it is a little weird

825
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
That you can

826
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
You have to

827
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
We're having this problem now that

828
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
We have two Xbox 360's in our house

829
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
If we put the live on one

830
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
We have to migrate the account to play on the other

831
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Xbox every time

832
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
It's a little irritating

833
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
It's weird

834
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Frisbee in our chatroom says

835
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
The console versions should let you use keyboard and mouse

836
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
That would be kind of nice

837
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
You can hook up the USB stuff and then use that

838
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
That would be nice

839
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I guess maybe that's why they give you the PC one free

840
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
I don't know

841
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Other games I've played this week

842
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
It doesn't stop there

843
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Those are the two big ones

844
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I bought a 3DS

845
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Chapter 4 on the 3DS

846
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
I didn't realize

847
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Every single freaking fighter

848
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
From the original

849
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Is in the 3DS version

850
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
That's pretty impressive that they have all that

851
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Obviously the graphics have been scaled down a little bit

852
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
To make it all fit

853
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
But it's 3D

854
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
And there's this cool little mode where you can actually play

855
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Over the shoulder of one of the characters

856
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
That it's very 3D

857
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Kind of neat

858
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
All the little modes that they put in that

859
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Loki kind of reviewed the title on the show before

860
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
So I'm not going to rehash everything

861
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
But I do like that they've put in a street pass feature

862
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Where you can fight things

863
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
It gives you incentive to keep playing

864
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
So you can collect these little trophies

865
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Different from achievements

866
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
But the little trophies are what you use in street pass mode

867
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
To help fight other people and so forth

868
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
And 3DS is a system

869
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
I'm liking it so far

870
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
I feel like there's so much more potential there

871
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
That we're going to unlock in May

872
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
When they do some of the patches

873
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
There's a lot in the interface

874
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Where you hit the button and it says

875
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
This feature is not yet available

876
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
It will be installed through a system update

877
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
But otherwise the online is much easier on this

878
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Than it has been on other systems

879
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I couldn't tell you how much

880
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
I shouldn't say the word impressed

881
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
But the first time I went into the menu

882
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Where I could just see all my friends

883
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
And if they're online or not and what they're playing

884
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
The reaction I had of

885
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
It's about freaking time Nintendo

886
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
It's still code based

887
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
It's still code based

888
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
But it's supposedly one code

889
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
For everything which is nice

890
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
And I had some issues

891
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
With the facial recognition

892
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
It'll make your little

893
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Me avatar

894
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
You take a picture of yourself

895
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
You square your head

896
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
In the frame

897
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
And it thinks that I have

898
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Really huge jowls

899
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
My head looked like a bell

900
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
My 3DS is apparently

901
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
GLaDOS because it was calling you fat

902
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
I think it was

903
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
I'm rocking a beard right now

904
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
And I think it just thought that my

905
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Facial hair was face

906
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
So it's like, yeah

907
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Well the good news is if you don't like the me that it gives you

908
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
You can go in and tweak it

909
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
And I'll tell you what, the first time you take a picture

910
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
And have it do a me based on your picture

911
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
You're not gonna like what comes out

912
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
I'm just convinced nobody's gonna like the thing that comes out

913
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
It's the new technological advance

914
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Of the driver's license photo

915
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Where you get

916
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
It in the mail and you're like, oh was I sick

917
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
That day?

918
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Exactly, that's a very good way of putting it

919
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Alright, so gosh

920
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
I think I've covered about everything

921
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
I have Final Fantasy IV, the complete edition

922
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
On order as well

923
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
I was frugal in my shopping and I went on Amazon.com

924
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
And bought Mortal Kombat

925
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
And Portal 2

926
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
I got like $20 credit for buying one

927
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
And $10 credit for buying the other

928
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
I usually don't give shout outs to retail chains

929
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Or anything like that

930
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Because we're a commercial free show

931
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
But I just gotta say as a gamer, I was pretty impressed

932
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
They only charged me $4 for shipping

933
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
They had the games there on release day

934
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
I got $30 worth of free credit

935
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Which I used to buy the Final Fantasy IV complete collection

936
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Which was the other game I wanted this week

937
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
So, win!

938
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Hey, I'm all for good deals, exactly

939
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Alright

940
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Let's see, going to our chatroom again

941
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Chat.orangeloungeradio.com

942
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Bonds006 in our chat agrees

943
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
It does make you look not like yourself

944
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Tigerclaw says

945
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Regarding the Streetpass, so far it's been working

946
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
I go about 4 miles from Streetpass

947
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
But the fine me still

948
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Oh, I don't know

949
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Oh, I think I got about 4 me's

950
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
From Streetpass, but the fine me

951
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Still won't let me use them

952
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
How many Streetpass me's do you need in order

953
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
For fine me to work without buying the heroes?

954
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Good question, I haven't figured that out yet

955
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
I just got the 3DS last night

956
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
So I have yet to run into people

957
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Or run into the mall or anything

958
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Or a place where other gamers are

959
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Where I've had Streetpass

960
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
I've just bought the me's

961
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
And what I mean by that, the 3DS has a built in game

962
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Called fine me

963
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
And it's a little chibi role playing game

964
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Like very bare bones

965
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Like fight, magic, run type of thing

966
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Very bare bones

967
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
And you can use coins that you get from the pedometer

968
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
The pedometer is built into the 3DS

969
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
And every time you're in sleep mode

970
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Every time you take 100 steps

971
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
You get a maximum 10 coins a day

972
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
So it's pretty cool because it's encouraging people to go out and walk

973
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Or shake their DS repeatedly to get the steps

974
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
It's kind of like that

975
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Walking trainer game that came out

976
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
For the DSi a couple

977
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Years ago

978
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
It's been actually built into the 3DS

979
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
And you get coins for doing it

980
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
And you can buy heroes

981
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
And as you play through this role playing mode

982
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
You unlock hats for your me's

983
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Like the very first thing you get is a little Mario hat

984
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
That you can put on your me

985
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
For your me

986
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
So if you want to be a little kitty

987
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
That sounds awesome

988
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Alright so

989
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Let's move on

990
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Oh BlackWolf in our chatroom says

991
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
I got one me and I used him on fine me

992
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
So I guess maybe there's

993
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Something that Tigerclaw missed in that

994
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
I don't know

995
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Yeah I gotta try and get more me's

996
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
I was hoping Loki would be here so we could street past the DS's

997
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
But oh well

998
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Easter's more important I suppose

999
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
We're going to move into some gaming news

1000
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
But first some quick plugs for where you can find us

1001
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Around the internet we are on Twitter

1002
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Twitter.com slash OLR

1003
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
As well as Facebook, facebook.com

1004
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Slash orange lounge radio

1005
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
And of course once again we do tape live

1006
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
At All Games Radio www.allgames.com

1007
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
If you've never joined us for a live show

1008
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Why not?

1009
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
You should sometime at some point

1010
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Alright let's get into tonight's gaming news

1011
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Pop's going to start us off tonight since he's filling in for Loki

1012
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
This is a huge story that's been

1013
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Covered most major avenues

1014
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
For gaming news and that is

1015
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
The fact that on Wednesday night

1016
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
The Playstation Network

1017
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Went down like a drunk

1018
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Bicurious frat boy at a Jack Jansen concert

1019
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
It's just gone

1020
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
That's yeah

1021
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Wednesday night

1022
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
No PSN, no store

1023
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
No

1024
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Curiosity

1025
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Store or anything like that

1026
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
And Sony confirmed that it was

1027
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Because of an external intrusion

1028
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Which means they got

1029
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Text

1030
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Someone got into the system

1031
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
In a bad way and brought

1032
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
The whole thing down and I guess

1033
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Given the statement that

1034
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Cybold

1035
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Put out

1036
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
It sounds like they're completely

1037
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Rebuilding their

1038
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
The OS or

1039
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Whatever the security patch was so bad

1040
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
That they're willing to take down their entire

1041
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Store for five days now

1042
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Nearly

1043
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
And what a shitty time for this to happen

1044
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
I mean you know this is the

1045
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Week to have a Playstation 3 of all

1046
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Weeks you know Mortal Kombat

1047
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Has the slight edge having one more

1048
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Character on the PS3 and let's face it a better

1049
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Controller sorry

1050
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
And Portal 2 obviously

1051
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
You know they

1052
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Gabe Newell got up there at

1053
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
E3 and said

1054
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
K my bad on Playstation my bad guys

1055
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
It's actually going to be the system you're going to want to

1056
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Own Portal 2 on remember that

1057
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
And obviously with the Steam integration

1058
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
It's pretty great and so

1059
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
I kind of wonder how that plays into it like

1060
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Maybe just the fact that now all of a sudden

1061
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
All these folks who maybe own both

1062
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Systems were like opting for the PS3

1063
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Versions in conjunction with whatever

1064
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Else is going on behind the scenes it brought it

1065
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Down

1066
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Yeah I'm sure you know there are people at Valve that

1067
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
I don't want to say they're you know

1068
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Pissed but it's there

1069
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
It's a huge release for Valve and

1070
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
The

1071
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Authoritative console version

1072
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
You can't do co-op on it right now because

1073
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Of Sony so I'm sure they've got all these

1074
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Developers not just Valve breathing down their neck

1075
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Going how did this happen you know

1076
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Consumers are worried that

1077
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
If the hack was

1078
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
You know this bad that it would bring down their

1079
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Entire network for five days

1080
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Did they have access to customer records

1081
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Because a lot of people have their credit cards saved

1082
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Because they like just the one click purchase

1083
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
I gotta admit that makes me

1084
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Very nervous because

1085
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Yeah alright mine's on there and I'm a

1086
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Little worried about this because

1087
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
You know if that

1088
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Information got out I want to know

1089
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Like and I need Sony to be communicating

1090
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
A little better than like yeah we're down

1091
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Because we got hacked no shit

1092
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Like we all read the internet

1093
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Even CNN was reporting about how

1094
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Anonymous was attacking Playstation Network

1095
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
And whether they're responsible for this or not

1096
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
I mean Sony has an obligation

1097
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
To tell me exactly

1098
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
What information of mine is out there

1099
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
California has some pretty strict consumer rights

1100
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Laws involving

1101
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Statements made about their information

1102
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
I think the federal government has some pretty strict laws on that

1103
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Stuff it's not just California many states

1104
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Do you know but uh

1105
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Yeah I mean obviously but the

1106
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Bummer is I think

1107
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
You can report up to

1108
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
90 days after the incident

1109
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
And I'm sorry Sony I want to know now

1110
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Like stop giving all this fluff

1111
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
What exactly is happening

1112
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
We're going on 4 to 5 days now

1113
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
You know and

1114
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
You know we kind of joke

1115
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
About how on this show like a lot of times

1116
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
The system will go down for a day or two

1117
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
And it's always like nobody ever remembers

1118
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Nobody ever remembers that

1119
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Xbox went down right after Halo 3

1120
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Came out too you know

1121
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Gamers pretty much overlook this stuff

1122
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Because once it's fixed then they can play their games

1123
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
But this is starting to go on one of those

1124
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Things where it's getting harder and harder

1125
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
To say you're just going to easily forget this

1126
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Especially if we find out

1127
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
That our information was at risk

1128
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
That is going to be a huge

1129
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Huge

1130
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Smack in the face of digital distribution

1131
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Is the new model and GameStop

1132
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Will buy breathe a huge sigh of relief

1133
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Because they'll be open that much longer

1134
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
I think with the Xbox

1135
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
They've had the gold which is

1136
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
The 4 pay platform you know

1137
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
For Xbox Live that's been around

1138
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Longer more people depend on that for the

1139
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Co-op playing for Netflix

1140
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Whereas the PSN you know

1141
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
You post your trophies and you do some matching service

1142
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
On it but PSN

1143
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Because it doesn't have I mean if you don't buy

1144
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
The download games

1145
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
From PSN there's really no reason

1146
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
For them to have your credit card information

1147
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Whereas on the Xbox Live service

1148
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
You need a credit card for gold period

1149
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
I actually don't put

1150
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Any of my information in those if I can

1151
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Help it because with

1152
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Xbox you put it in there they will find

1153
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
A way that

1154
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Even if you unintentionally

1155
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Press something they're still going to charge you

1156
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
So it's best not to have it in there

1157
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
At all just buy the points through

1158
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
The internet for the PlayStation Network

1159
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
What I would do is I would I don't know if you can

1160
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Do this anymore but I would go onto the site

1161
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
The website PlayStation Network put

1162
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Some money in my bucket or whatever

1163
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Then buy the game through the PS3

1164
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
That way I can do a one-time transaction

1165
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
And they don't have my credit card saved in there

1166
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Because otherwise I don't trust it well this might

1167
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Be one of those tough lessons learned I mean granted

1168
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
I have a pretty good bank who you know

1169
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Isn't gonna you know if I were to something bad were

1170
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
To happen they're not gonna hold me liable for it

1171
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
But it the whole thing will just piss me off more

1172
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
It'll piss me off more

1173
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Whoever hacked this thing which now

1174
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
We can't figure out if it was anonymous or not

1175
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
And this is

1176
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Really interesting because this just pulls

1177
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Back this whole other layer of

1178
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
What is anonymous all about

1179
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Because because of the fact that they don't

1180
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Have a face they are anonymous

1181
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
So to speak it is so easy

1182
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
For the media to blame them for this

1183
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Which is what's happening they may not be responsible

1184
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
But they're getting the blame for this because

1185
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
There's no one to defend anonymous because they're anonymous

1186
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
And that adds actually to their notoriety

1187
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Yeah as I understand it

1188
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
They're probably eating it up

1189
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
As I understand it a couple weeks ago when the

1190
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
The GeoHats verdict came down

1191
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
They did a couple days of DDOS attacks

1192
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Which is where they flood the system with requests

1193
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
That was it so this thing

1194
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
That just brought you know brought the whole thing down

1195
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Like a house of cards they're like it's not

1196
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Whoever the people that

1197
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Yeah whoever the mouthpiece is whoever is calling

1198
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
The shots which is probably

1199
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
They're like it's not us we did our shit three weeks ago

1200
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Well and also the reason why they

1201
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Stopped was because they realized

1202
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
They were putting the consumers at risk and that's not

1203
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
What they wanted to do so I actually

1204
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
When you mention that you know

1205
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
They're getting more notoriety

1206
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
I actually this isn't the notoriety

1207
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
That they want they don't want to be responsible for the

1208
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Consumers because that's who they were trying to defend

1209
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
In the first place so this whole GeoHats thing

1210
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
But unfortunately how easy

1211
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Is it for the not

1212
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
As tech savvy media mainstream

1213
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Media to just say well it's

1214
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Anonymous' fault you know they said they were gonna

1215
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
They put out these videos and Anonymous Anonymous Anonymous

1216
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Anonymous I mean maybe they like having their name

1217
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Out there but I don't necessarily think this is

1218
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
What they wanted their name on but because

1219
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Anonymous has no mouthpiece

1220
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
This could be a whole

1221
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Subset of the group that's doing

1222
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
This and we just don't know

1223
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
It's interesting

1224
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
That whole

1225
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Politics or whatever you want to call it behind

1226
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
It is fascinating

1227
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
And just to get to the meat and potatoes of this story

1228
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Patrick Sebold who is the head

1229
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Of PR for Sony this is his actual

1230
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Statement on it

1231
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Quote an external

1232
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Intrusion on our system has affected

1233
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Our Playstation network and

1234
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Curiosity services in order to

1235
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Conduct a thorough investigation and

1236
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
To verify the smooth and secure operation

1237
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Of our network services going forward

1238
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
We turned off Playstation network

1239
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
And Curiosity services on the evening

1240
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Of Wednesday April 20th

1241
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Providing quality entertainment services

1242
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
To our customers and partners is our utmost

1243
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Priority

1244
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
That's their

1245
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
See that's all they got to say about it

1246
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Part of me is kinda like something really

1247
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Bad happened this is much

1248
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
More than a DDoS attack

1249
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Because if that was the case

1250
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
We would not be sitting down talking about

1251
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Deconstructing the whole fucking thing

1252
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
During Easter weekend

1253
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Which is the start of

1254
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Spring break when you have

1255
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Two of your biggest titles out

1256
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
That is why I'm sitting here going

1257
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
I think private information was

1258
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Breached and I think it's gonna come out in the next

1259
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Week that that's what happened

1260
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
And that kinda worries me

1261
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Like otherwise your timing

1262
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Is just ridiculous Sony

1263
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
As someone with a

1264
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Sales analyst background

1265
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
The fact that their store

1266
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Is offline

1267
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Like oh yeah that's no revenue for a week

1268
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
That's you know

1269
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Even a company as big as Sony that makes

1270
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
You know billions of dollars a year

1271
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
If you don't make a penny for five days you will feel it

1272
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
So yeah it's pretty serious

1273
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Alright

1274
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Well let's move on with some more stories

1275
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
This one kinda came up while we were off last week

1276
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
But it's just speaking of

1277
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Demons with multiple heads or whatever you want to call it

1278
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
This is a story that's just been going on and on

1279
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Over the past couple weeks that

1280
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
You know we didn't have a show last week and that is

1281
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
The rumored new

1282
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Nintendo console. A new Nintendo

1283
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Console is rumored to be debuting at E3

1284
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
This June

1285
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Supposedly launching in 2012

1286
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
It's supposed to be you know more powerful

1287
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Obviously than the Wii

1288
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
A lot of talk about how it's supposed to be scary

1289
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Similar to the Xbox 360

1290
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Where if you develop a game for the

1291
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
360 it's supposed to be just that much easier

1292
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
For you to develop for whatever this

1293
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
New Nintendo console is

1294
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
These leaks are coming

1295
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
From Game Informer who I believe

1296
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Was sorting a French

1297
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Site in their news which was

1298
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
The same French site that I believe broke

1299
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
The story on the PSP Go

1300
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
So it's kinda one of those things where like

1301
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
If the site was true before they're probably

1302
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Right again you know

1303
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Yeah and Game Informer is the face

1304
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Of GameSpot

1305
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
And did also Forbes run

1306
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Or was it Wall Street Journal that ran a story on this

1307
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Like a really very dry

1308
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
It was enough to break to the mainstream

1309
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Media and that's just making people give this

1310
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Thought that it's probably

1311
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
True which

1312
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
I'm kind of sad Loki's not

1313
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Here because I swear to god if you go back

1314
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
In the archives and listen to a show in January

1315
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
I told him I said

1316
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Nintendo's gonna announce a new console at E3

1317
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
This year and he's like no they're not the Wii's still

1318
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Printing money I said what do they have coming

1319
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Out on the Wii there is no

1320
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Big title on the Wii right now except

1321
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Zelda that is it

1322
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
And now they've pushed Zelda back

1323
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
What's the real reason Zelda just

1324
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Got pushed back everybody

1325
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
That game was ready to roll I'll bet you

1326
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Anything but now it's been pushed back why

1327
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
It's getting the same treatment that the

1328
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Last Zelda game did

1329
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Guarantee it

1330
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
And it's gonna be multi

1331
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Console just like the last one

1332
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
And oh I wanted him to be here so bad

1333
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
So I could point I told you so I told you so

1334
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
But yeah this

1335
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
And honestly I kind of

1336
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
See this as kind of a duh

1337
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
What else did Nintendo have to talk about at E3 this year

1338
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
As far as consoles go

1339
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
I mean I should say

1340
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Living room consoles go the 3DS

1341
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Obviously is gonna be the clearly

1342
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
They're gonna roll out the Mario game and the

1343
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Kid Icarus game and those are gonna be their big titles that are gonna

1344
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Sell more this year as they talk about

1345
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Netflix and some of the other multimedia

1346
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Guaranteed you're gonna see that and whatever

1347
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Way we can make 9 year olds

1348
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Wanna have a 3DS they're gonna

1349
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Try to sell as many of those under the Christmas tree as they can

1350
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
More Pokemans

1351
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Yeah and the rumor is there's gonna be a Pokemon

1352
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Announcement at some point as well

1353
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
So I would take that

1354
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
A little closer to Tokyo Game Show but sure

1355
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
That's an inevitable as well

1356
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Pokemon Plaid and Pokedot

1357
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Pokemon 3D

1358
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
But as far as you know

1359
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Living room consoles go it's been dead

1360
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
On Nintendo's front I mean even with the

1361
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Zelda game if that game

1362
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Was really coming out like soon

1363
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
We would be flooded with more

1364
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
More uh

1365
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
I don't know screenshots

1366
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
And videos and things of that nature

1367
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
So guarantee it there's a new console in the

1368
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Works I mean Nintendo has to play

1369
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Catch up in some regards to this

1370
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
It prints money

1371
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Well there's even more rumors that um

1372
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
There's even more rumors

1373
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
That follow up with this

1374
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
And some of it has to do with the

1375
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Controller I suppose it's gonna be

1376
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
With this system

1377
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Apparently the by the way

1378
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
They're calling this whole thing Project Cafe

1379
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Which I guess is like you know

1380
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Dolphin was for the GameCube

1381
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Right or was that the 64?

1382
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
And then Revolution was the codename for the Wii

1383
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
The Saturn was the Katana I think

1384
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
This will not be called Project Cafe

1385
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
When it comes out guaranteed

1386
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Yeah the Saturn was Katana but then when they

1387
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Were doing Pre for Dreamcast it was Neptune

1388
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
That's right

1389
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
They will do some very

1390
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Weird name that is very

1391
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
One syllable type of easy thing just like

1392
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
You know Wii was they'll do something like that

1393
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
But anyway supposedly the

1394
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Controller is supposed to be like an iPad

1395
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
With buttons 8 buttons

1396
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
2 analog sticks a camera a

1397
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
6.2 inch touch screen

1398
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
That's kind of weird because that

1399
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Means the controllers themselves

1400
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Would cost several hundred dollars

1401
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
If they're as fancy as everyone

1402
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Thinks they are now see part of me says

1403
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
I don't necessarily think they're as good

1404
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
As an iPad or an iPod

1405
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Because you know what I think about I've seen these

1406
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Printers for sale at Fry's

1407
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
That have a removable touch screen type of thing

1408
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
That you can take from the printer

1409
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
And actually look at like the vices

1410
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
And the screen it's okay but it's

1411
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Kind of cheap I think that

1412
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Is more what this is going to look like if this is even

1413
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
True because the problem with this is

1414
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
That now that you have these

1415
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Rumors that look like they're going to be true

1416
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Everybody's sucking onto

1417
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
It and now once you know you're going to see

1418
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Fake pictures fake

1419
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Everybody's going to just have a field day with this

1420
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
I'm just thinking of the VMU now

1421
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
And that's what a lot of people

1422
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Are saying too

1423
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
That would make sense and I honestly

1424
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
I played little things on my VMU

1425
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
I was trying to raise my

1426
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Chow

1427
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
In Japanese

1428
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
And the Final Fantasy

1429
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Oh wait no

1430
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
This is the pocket station too

1431
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Yeah I totally just switched up

1432
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
That had that really cool thing

1433
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
The integration with the second rival schools

1434
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Yeah the evolution disc

1435
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
And also

1436
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Nintendo has kind of

1437
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Ever since they GameCube

1438
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
They've been the more affordable

1439
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Family friendly option

1440
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
So they can't go all high tech and put out

1441
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
You know a $600 system because that's

1442
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Going to go against what their business model

1443
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Has been for like 7 years now

1444
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
I agree this has to be a cheap

1445
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
System and I don't mean like they could probably

1446
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Get away with selling it for $300

1447
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Maybe $400 if it's that fucking good

1448
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
But it's going to have to be cheaper

1449
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Than like an iPad

1450
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
You know how much was the Wii when it first came out? 250

1451
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
But of course it was supposed to be the budget system

1452
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
It was a steal yeah

1453
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
I honestly don't see them putting out such an expensive

1454
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Piece of technology as a controller

1455
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
I truly think if this is even true

1456
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
I really think you're looking at something

1457
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Like those printers

1458
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Because those printers are only like $300

1459
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
And they have that little device that you take

1460
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Right off of them

1461
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
I think we're looking at something more like that

1462
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
They're all going to have Game Boy Micros attached to them

1463
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Well

1464
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Whatever will help them sell

1465
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
More virtual console games

1466
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
I would think your 3DS

1467
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Would be the ideal controller for this system

1468
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
If they really want to

1469
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Have that synergy

1470
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Like remember back in the day

1471
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Remember

1472
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
The Advance had the link cable to the GameCube

1473
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
We needed it for Animal Crossing

1474
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
To do the island

1475
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
There were 3 games that used it

1476
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Animal Crossing, the Pacman

1477
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Versus, and Zelda

1478
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Sonic Adventure 2 and the Sonic

1479
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Advance games

1480
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
The Chao trading

1481
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
And then you can do weird things like unlock original Metroid

1482
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
But I don't consider that a full feature

1483
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
That's just, you know

1484
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Quick tangent about the Wii real quick

1485
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
It's hooked up now at your place

1486
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
For the first time in like 16 months

1487
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Yes I did, I hooked up the Wii for the first time in 16 months

1488
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
And what did I play on it?

1489
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
I think Super Metroid, we also hooked up the Super Nintendo

1490
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
I found my bonafide Super Nintendo

1491
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
And we were playing Mortal Kombat

1492
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Like the real Mortal Kombat

1493
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
That was kind of cool

1494
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
I'm a little distracted right now

1495
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
I don't want to call this breaking news or whatever

1496
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
But I just have to throw this out here because I know Dark Sakura

1497
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Is going to be interested in this

1498
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
And Mikolatov, if you're listening, which I know you are, you need to post his link in chat

1499
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Because he's showing me graphics from Phantasy Star

1500
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Online 2

1501
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Yeah, my friend Krista posted those images today

1502
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
I guess more information came out on this

1503
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
I have not seen this at all

1504
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Technically she posted them yesterday from Japan

1505
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
There's more information on 4gamer.net

1506
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Yeah

1507
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
This looks like Universe

1508
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Kind of

1509
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Like in high def and these cool little screens

1510
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
I miss Phantasy Star Online

1511
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
I do too

1512
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
And there was just something missing in Phantasy Star Universe

1513
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
So I hope Sega has figured it out

1514
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Who am I kidding?

1515
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
I'm going to get that game when it comes out

1516
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
I'm not even going to lie

1517
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Oh, Ziba reminded me

1518
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles 2

1519
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
For the Game Boy Advance controller

1520
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
That's right

1521
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
I guess there were a few, not just one or two games

1522
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
And Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles

1523
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Was a pretty cool game too

1524
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
And those were all games

1525
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
That very few people ever really got to experience

1526
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Because the setup for it was so damn expensive

1527
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
But yeah, the Crystal Chronicles

1528
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Thing was so cool

1529
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Alright

1530
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Anyhow, one other rumor

1531
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
About the new Nintendo system

1532
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Supposedly, Nintendo is

1533
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Trying to make nice nice with Rockstar

1534
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Trying to get them to develop for the Wii 2

1535
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
And

1536
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
This is a report

1537
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
From, what is this, Zero One Net

1538
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Which I think is also Go Nintendo

1539
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
I don't know, it's all over the internet somewhere

1540
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Saying that Rockstar

1541
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Apparently is

1542
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Being courted for Grand Theft Auto 5

1543
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
To release in, well

1544
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
2012 is supposed to be when Grand Theft Auto 5 comes out

1545
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
And Nintendo is supposedly courting them

1546
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
To release the game on

1547
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
This new Nintendo system as well

1548
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Which really, it makes sense

1549
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
And it's not like Rockstar hates Nintendo

1550
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Rockstar put out that mediocre

1551
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Grand Theft Auto game on the DS

1552
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Remember, the Chinatown Wars or whatever

1553
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
So it would not be unheard of

1554
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
For Rockstar to develop for the Nintendo console

1555
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
But I think if Nintendo wanted to be serious

1556
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
About the whole, hey

1557
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
We're going back for the hardcore gamer

1558
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
This year

1559
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Maybe that'll be Reggie Zangle when he takes the E3 stage

1560
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
We've made a gaming console for everybody

1561
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
We've made a gaming console

1562
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
For those that want to play their Wii games on HD

1563
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
We've made a gaming console for kids

1564
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
We've made a gaming console for the hardcore gamer

1565
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
You want proof?

1566
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
We're getting Grand Theft Auto 5

1567
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Bet you never thought you'd hear me saying that

1568
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
You know that's not going to happen

1569
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Well, he won't say it like that

1570
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Oh, I think Grand Theft Auto 5, if the rumors are true

1571
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
About that

1572
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
This is as easy to develop for us

1573
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
With the Xbox 360 and so forth

1574
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
They have that synergy because of the hardware

1575
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
That both systems are using

1576
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
I think this is absolutely true

1577
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
But

1578
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
I think this is also part of fanboy wank

1579
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
It kind of blurs the line

1580
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
I think it's obvious fanboy wank

1581
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
You know how sometimes sites

1582
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Will report on things that are kind of obvious

1583
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
I think this falls in that category

1584
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
To be honest

1585
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
You know what, I kind of wish

1586
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
That more companies would do

1587
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
One of the things that made the Dreamcast

1588
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Easy to develop on

1589
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Is the fact that it would build in a Windows CE

1590
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Environment

1591
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
And every time a Dreamcast game would load

1592
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
That was built in Windows CE

1593
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
It installed the newest version of Windows CE

1594
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
And then played the game

1595
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
So you always had

1596
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Your system OS tailored

1597
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
To the game that you were playing

1598
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Alright, again, going to our chat room

1599
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
At chat.orangeloungeradio.com

1600
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Is where you want to be

1601
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Orangeloungeradio.com and click on chat

1602
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Or on the Game Surge Network

1603
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
On channel Orangelounge

1604
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Is where you want to be, that's our official chat room

1605
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Some comments there

1606
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Saying San in our chat room says

1607
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Chinatown Wars was not mediocre

1608
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
From what I've heard, I'm just going off Loki

1609
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Who's like the biggest gramp, that's auto addict I know, sorry

1610
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
DDR Dollar Bill

1611
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Says Chinatown Wars was just too dark

1612
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
To play, and Randy in our chat room

1613
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Says Niko Bellic and Nex Super

1614
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Smash Brothers

1615
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Now that

1616
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
That could be an interesting set of talks

1617
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
You know what, going with

1618
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
The fanboy wank and this whole thing

1619
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
You know, obviously the Zelda game will be

1620
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
One of the games that has a hybrid thing

1621
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Going on with the next console, but

1622
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
If they really want me to just lose my

1623
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Shit on whatever this new console is

1624
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
How about that new F-Zero game already?

1625
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Huh?

1626
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Now that you're going to be all high def and stuff

1627
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Give me a new F-Zero game, why not?

1628
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
I know seriously

1629
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
The original F-Zero was a launch title for Super Nintendo

1630
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
So it's not unheard of that F-Zero could be a launch title

1631
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Oh yeah

1632
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
F-Zero and Pilotwings in Mario World

1633
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Were the original launch titles

1634
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
I remember because I wanted them all

1635
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
So there you go

1636
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Well how about something else that was on the SNES

1637
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
How about it?

1638
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
And we've already mentioned Final Fantasy

1639
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
But Final Fantasy 6, which was released in the US

1640
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Initially as Final Fantasy 3

1641
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
It is coming

1642
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Out on Virtual Console and

1643
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
PlayStation Network

1644
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
So it is

1645
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Going to be there available to play

1646
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
And I don't

1647
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
However see a date attached to this

1648
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
In fact

1649
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
I am trying to see if there's a date on the

1650
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Article and it does not

1651
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
The release date is soon

1652
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Yeah it's soon

1653
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
But it is also going to have

1654
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
The full motion video

1655
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
That came with

1656
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
The PlayStation

1657
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Updates with the Chronicles

1658
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Oh it's like the opera scene and

1659
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
The Kefka's Tower and a few others

1660
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Hopefully it won't have the shitty loading

1661
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
Times

1662
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
If it's going to be playing on PlayStation Network

1663
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
It's probably going to be something you're downloading

1664
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
So you won't have to worry about that

1665
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
If it's all off the hard drive then the load time

1666
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Should be minimal

1667
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Depending on the emulator, I don't know

1668
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
We've also put Flickr in here

1669
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Yeah, no

1670
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
I've already got 50 million copies of this

1671
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Plus the original, so

1672
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Yeah I've got

1673
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
A ROM, the cart, and then

1674
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
The GBA

1675
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Port

1676
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
I will probably still buy it

1677
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
I will still buy it because I'm a consumer whore

1678
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
And how?

1679
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
And Final Fantasy 6

1680
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Is so fucking good

1681
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
It's

1682
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
So good

1683
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
That was the game

1684
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
When I was like 17, 18 years old

1685
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Now I told you about how I

1686
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Stayed home from school for a week

1687
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
To play it

1688
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
By telling everyone I had the flu

1689
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Final Fantasy 7

1690
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
People hate on Final Fantasy 7

1691
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Because it's not more

1692
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Final Fantasy 6

1693
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Let's be honest, people didn't like the 3D thing

1694
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
And people didn't like the whole Neo

1695
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
7 was a great game

1696
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
It was, but people hate on it because it wasn't

1697
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
More of 6

1698
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
7 was rushed by Sony

1699
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
So it wasn't really even done

1700
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
But yeah, I really wish that

1701
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
5 and 6 got the DS

1702
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
3D treatment that 3 and 4 did

1703
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Because those remakes were so good

1704
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
But I guess on the 3DS the same thing could happen

1705
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Oh yeah, oh yeah, absolutely

1706
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Going to our chatroom at chat.orangelaunchready.com

1707
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Lots of

1708
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
People perking up at the idea

1709
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Of F-Zero on the new Nintendo console

1710
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
Being possible launch title

1711
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
BlackWolf says F-Zero yes

1712
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
I agree with F-Zero, Mieleki F-Zero

1713
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Mieleki F-Zero

1714
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Oh no, I'm sorry, Mieleki F-Zero was from Flaming Toilet

1715
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
In our chatroom

1716
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
BlackWolf continued up saying

1717
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
F-Zero GX equals most beautiful GameCube game

1718
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Absolutely

1719
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
You could put that game in the Wii

1720
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
And you would not even be able to tell

1721
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
It's a game from last gen

1722
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
F-Zero GX is so good

1723
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
It's like my favorite racing game

1724
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
I think almost ever

1725
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Let's see

1726
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Kaijuto, not much of a fan

1727
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Of F-Zero, people love that F-Zero

1728
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
I never liked it, it was too fast for me

1729
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
My friend tried to top trade it off to me

1730
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
And I hate it, well I'm talking about the first

1731
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
F-Zero, that's the only one I saw and knew of

1732
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
It made me sick, never liked it

1733
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
See that's what I liked about F-Zero, was that it was fast

1734
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
It's like

1735
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
I don't know, it's like

1736
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
When I first saw the commercials for

1737
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Blur and everything, I kind of thought it was

1738
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Going to be like F-Zero with real cars

1739
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
I just don't think anything

1740
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Is going to be quite like F-Zero, but F-Zero

1741
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
If that makes any sense

1742
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
It's just such an awesome racing game

1743
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
Rama in our chat room says

1744
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
People hate On7 because it's the most popular

1745
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Hoard out and overplayed in the fandoms

1746
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Yeah

1747
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
Yeah

1748
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
That's part of it too

1749
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
Alright, moving on with some more gaming news

1750
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
SalaciousPop, what do you got for us?

1751
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
Microsoft has registered a patent

1752
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
For networked and

1753
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Personalized Kinect profiles

1754
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
So that

1755
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
People can get

1756
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
The Kinect to remember their own

1757
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Unique mannerisms

1758
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
And how to interact with the device

1759
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
And also

1760
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
That profile would follow you

1761
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
If you ever went to a different

1762
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Xbox and imported your

1763
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
It would be attached to your

1764
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Gamertag, is what I'm trying to say

1765
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
And you can also use it to communicate

1766
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Possibly to other

1767
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
XBLA users that may not speak

1768
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
English

1769
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Or be able to communicate verbally

1770
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
So they might get some

1771
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
I don't know, like sign language

1772
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Stuff in there, but

1773
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Like a universal sign language type of thing?

1774
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
That's kind of weird

1775
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
When I was trying to use the Kinect

1776
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
You know, you lift your hand up and you move it

1777
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Over the tile that you want and you have to hold it there

1778
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
And you wait for the ring to spin around the hand icon

1779
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
I wanted to like

1780
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Punch it

1781
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
To the tile I wanted and I would go like this

1782
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
And then you were like, no, just hold your hand still

1783
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
And

1784
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
I think if I could go and say

1785
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
I don't like how the Kinect wants me to do

1786
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
This particular

1787
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Command, here's how I want to do it

1788
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
And have it save that and follow my profile around

1789
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
I think that's what this patent is for

1790
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
That'd be really cool

1791
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Interesting, but then they throw in this whole

1792
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Phones and computers into it and I'm like

1793
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
What, the phones are going to have Kinect in them?

1794
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
I hardly think so

1795
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
The profile comes in somehow

1796
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
I guess Kinect isn't just about

1797
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
The motions

1798
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
But voice as well

1799
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
So maybe the voice will activate your profile on the phone

1800
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Seems a little strange

1801
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Yeah

1802
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
Anyhow

1803
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Well I guess we'll see what comes to that

1804
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
That could be something that Microsoft's planning on unveiling at E3

1805
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
We'll see

1806
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
Something else we might find out more on very soon

1807
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
Is what is to come of this

1808
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Online survey that EA is doing

1809
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
As you know, surveys are a popular

1810
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
Breeding ground for rumors

1811
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
And this time it's about EA Sports

1812
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Apparently EA Sports is investigating

1813
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
The reception to a paid subscription

1814
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
That would deliver paid

1815
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Downloadable content for free

1816
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
And make some full versions of upcoming games

1817
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
Available to download before the release date

1818
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
So it's like you could join the club

1819
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
And then you get to break the

1820
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Excuse me, the embargo on games or something

1821
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
Kind of sounds a little bit like Playstation Plus

1822
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
But unique to EA or something, I don't know

1823
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
Some of the bullet points

1824
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
That were mentioned in the survey

1825
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Discounts on all downloadable content

1826
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
For participating EA Sports console based

1827
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
Titles

1828
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
Let's see

1829
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
That's the kind of stuff they're talking about asking

1830
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Also

1831
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
Of course you can get the game on Playstation

1832
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Network or Xbox Live before it even

1833
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Comes out

1834
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
That could be indicative of digital distribution

1835
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
And kind of moving more towards that mechanism

1836
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
So you would be able to

1837
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Bypass the store and buy the game

1838
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
From EA directly so they could keep all the

1839
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
Profits

1840
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
That apparently is

1841
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
The intent here, but you have to pay to join the club

1842
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
To do that, you get to pay to join this club

1843
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
So you can pay EA directly

1844
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
And get the game early

1845
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
That's what I'm reading out

1846
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Of this, right?

1847
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
It's kind of what it is

1848
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
So, hmm

1849
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
We'll see, also one other thing that they're talking

1850
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
About, the ability to transfer

1851
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
Paid content from your current participating

1852
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Titles to future title versions

1853
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
So, like, if you buy

1854
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
$50 worth of extra

1855
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
Golf courses in Tiger Woods 12

1856
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
You would get to transport them to future

1857
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
Games, which a lot of other game series

1858
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
Are already doing for free

1859
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Like DJ Hero did that, right?

1860
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
You had the downloadable thing that would

1861
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Unlock, oh, anyway

1862
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
You know, launch day DLC

1863
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
The ability to turn left, five bucks

1864
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
Launch day DLC, the ability to turn right

1865
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Five bucks

1866
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
That's where I'm worried, but it's a racing game

1867
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
So you only need to go forward

1868
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
You don't have to get left and right if you don't want to

1869
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
That's the one thing that excites me about what's

1870
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Going on with Sony right now, which I know sounds really

1871
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Messed up, but if it does come out

1872
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
That your personal data was put at risk

1873
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Digital distribution just got set back

1874
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
Four years, guaranteed

1875
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
If that comes out

1876
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Yeah, but then I think of Steam, and I

1877
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Think not really, but

1878
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
I think

1879
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
Yes and no, but

1880
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
On the console level, yes

1881
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
I don't know, Steam

1882
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
Steam is really just a store

1883
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Where PSN and XBLA is more of an

1884
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
Integrated

1885
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Matching process

1886
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
They're still stores, but they're stores that are built into your console

1887
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
It's a little different, whereas the PC

1888
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Isn't so much a console

1889
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
You have the freedom to do whatever you want on the PC

1890
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Yeah, and there are alternatives to Steam

1891
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
For the PC, it's the same platform

1892
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Right

1893
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
So we will see what comes of

1894
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
This possible paid subscription

1895
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
In the future, moving on

1896
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
Well, since we were on Steam and this is how

1897
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
I bought the game

1898
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Super Meat Boy Ultra

1899
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
Edition will be coming out in the UK

1900
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Sometime between July and September

1901
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
This year

1902
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
It will be published by Lace Mamba

1903
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
Global

1904
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
And it's going to be an actual boxed

1905
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
Edition

1906
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
That is going to be coming

1907
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
Out, so it will have a 40 page

1908
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
Booklet that has never before

1909
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
Seen art, and some behind the scenes

1910
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
Information, an extended version of

1911
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
Team Meat comics, and

1912
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
The soundtrack, and additional audio

1913
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
And a mini poster

1914
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Yay, a poster

1915
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
And

1916
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
Then you also get a slab of rotted meat

1917
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
And a band-aid

1918
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
And you get a meat dress

1919
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
You get a meat dress

1920
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Ok, maybe not

1921
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Maybe they have that as a marketing thing

1922
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Little bandages, Super Meat Boy Band-Aids

1923
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
See, that would be a good idea to have bandage girl

1924
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
Band-Aids

1925
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Absolutely

Copyright, Jamie, Orange Old Radio

1927
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
Pay, pay, pay

1928
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
Anyhow, let's move on

1929
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
And travel the world with some release dates

1930
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
And see what games are coming out to a store near you

1931
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
It's going to be hard to top last week

1932
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
But we'll see what happens

1933
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
SlicesPop, why don't you start us off with what is coming out

1934
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
This week in America

1935
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
We didn't have a

1936
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
Show last week, there are a few other titles

1937
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
Aside from MK

1938
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
And Portal that came out

1939
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
And that was SoCom 4

1940
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Was another big one for last week

1941
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
Nobody gets to play it right now

1942
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Yeah, totally

1943
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
And then Final Fantasy 4, the complete collection

1944
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
On PSP

1945
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Huge week for games, huge

1946
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
This week upcoming is

1947
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
Pretty sparse

1948
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
Considering people's

1949
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Wallets can't really take more

1950
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Gonzo weeks of

1951
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Game releases like last week

1952
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
So this one is pretty mellow

1953
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
We have Operation Flashpoint

1954
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Red River on PS3 and

1955
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
360

1956
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
Haunted for PC

1957
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
Operation Flashpoint

1958
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
Red River again on PC

1959
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
Darkspore on PC

1960
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
And

1961
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
IL-2

1962
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
I cannot even pronounce this

1963
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
Stramovic Cliffs of Dover on PC

1964
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
Which sounds like a weird budget

1965
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Army game, I don't even know what that is

1966
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
But that's it, it's like six titles

1967
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Bobby Blackwolf in our chatroom is lamenting

1968
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
The non-mention of Conduit 2

1969
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
Which also came out this last week

1970
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
This was

1971
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
Oh there it is, yeah, on the week

1972
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
And poor little Conduit 2 is gonna get that a lot

1973
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
This was not

1974
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
A smart week to release that game

1975
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
Sorry dudes, I don't know what else to say

1976
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
I think some

1977
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
Companies severely underestimated

1978
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
The power of portal combat

1979
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
On top of like SOCOM too

1980
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
SOCOM is a huge game too

1981
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
I actually think it was a dumb week to release

1982
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
Final Fantasy 4 too

1983
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Especially considering that

1984
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
The PSP does a lot through digital distribution

1985
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
Now, well, nobody can buy that game

1986
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
On the Playstation Network

1987
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
Right now

1988
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
Yikes. Let's go to Japan

1989
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
And see if it's any different over there

1990
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
This week in Japan on April 28th

1991
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
El Shaddai, Ascension of the Metatron

1992
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Coming out on the Xbox 360

1993
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
This game

1994
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
Is coming out from Ignition

1995
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
It's kind of an action based game

1996
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
Kind of looking at some of the screenshots here

1997
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
It looks kind of cool, looks like

1998
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
The art style to this is kind of interesting

1999
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
It kind of looks like that

2000
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
Oh, what was that game?

2001
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
I don't know, now I can't even remember the name of it

2002
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
But yeah, it has this really unique art style

2003
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
Reminds me of an old PC game

2004
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
Alone in the Dark, is that what it's called?

2005
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
I can't remember that. Let me see

2006
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
It was a classic game of the week she did not that long ago

2007
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
But I don't know why, the art style kind of reminds me of that a little bit

2008
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
But yeah, it's kind of an action game

2009
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
Maybe in the same vein as like Bayonetta

2010
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
Type of thing where you play a dude with a sword

2011
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
That is really pretty, I'm really big on it

2012
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
Again, that's El Shaddai, Ascension of the Metatron

2013
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
Comes out this week on the Xbox 360

2014
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
Very biblically themed

2015
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Also this week on the Xbox 360 in Japan

2016
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Espagluta 2, Black Label

2017
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
Platinum Collection

2018
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
Espagluta

2019
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
Price Reduction

2020
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
That's bullet hell, right?

2021
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
PlayStation 3 also gets El Shaddai this week

2022
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
That's pretty much the only big release over there

2023
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
On the PlayStation 3

2024
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
On the Nintendo Wii this week, nothing

2025
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
You're going to hear that a lot when it comes to the Nintendo Wii

2026
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
Because there's nothing coming out

2027
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
On the Nintendo 3DS, Deca Sporta

2028
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
3D Sports comes out

2029
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
That of course is Deca Sports

2030
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
From Hudson in Japan

2031
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Coming out on the regular DS

2032
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
Hakoyuki, Yugi Roku DS

2033
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
Comes out this week

2034
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
On the Nintendo DS non-3D

2035
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
That's an adventure game

2036
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
With little chibi characters that I'm sure

2037
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
Most people don't care about

2038
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
Because it's so last gen

2039
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
And then lastly, the Sony PSP

2040
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
Has a variety of games coming out this week in Japan

2041
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
Including Patapon 3, which I believe came out over here as well

2042
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Saigo no Yakuzoku no Monogatari

2043
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Comes out as well this week

2044
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
That is from Epic

2045
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
That is a Japanese RPG

2046
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
On the PSP

2047
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
Looks like kind of

2048
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Man vs. Robot type of thing

2049
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
And lastly

2050
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
Otome wa Onesama no

2051
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
I'm sorry, Ni Koi Shitiru

2052
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Portable 2

2053
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
Jin no Elder comes out this week

2054
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
As well and that is

2055
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
One more adventure game on the PSP in Japan

2056
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
And this is the one that features

2057
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
Pretty Girls

2058
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
And it looks like you play four Pretty Girls

2059
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
Going on these quests

2060
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
They're like looking through telescopes and dressing up

2061
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
It's like the Spice Girls get their own RPG

2062
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
Look at that

2063
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
In Japan. How about Europe?

2064
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
We have a few things for Europe

2065
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
On the

2066
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
26th is Mythos

2067
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
And the 27th is Outland

2068
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
And the 28th is Darkspore

2069
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
Shin Megami Tensei Persona 3

2070
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
Portable

2071
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
Also on the 29th is Thor the video game

2072
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
And

2073
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
Virtua Tennis 4

2074
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
That's it

2075
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Yay Virtua Tennis

2076
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
Let's move on with another story

2077
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
From Salacious Pot. The classic game of the week

2078
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
Is coming up in just a little bit. Stay tuned

2079
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
Okay so

2080
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
As of the

2081
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
16th which would have been I guess last

2082
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
Weekend

2083
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
The Wii console has experienced a price drop

2084
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Best Buy got to do it first

2085
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
For about a day

2086
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
Before everyone else

2087
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
$170

2088
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
And then every other major retailer

2089
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
Started selling it at that

2090
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
Price I think within 48 hours

2091
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
Later so yeah that as of the

2092
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
18th you can get a Wii kit for

2093
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
170 bucks and also

2094
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Just more recently announced

2095
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
Wii Sports Resort

2096
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
And Wii Party which are the two

2097
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
I guess they're bundle titles that you can also

2098
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
Buy separately. Also got a

2099
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
More of the staple titles

2100
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
Of the current Wii lineup

2101
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
If you just can't get enough Woohoo Island

2102
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
Yeah

2103
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Those prices dropped

2104
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
$10 down to

2105
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
$39.99

2106
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
Per title starting the

2107
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
25th which is tomorrow

2108
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
So Wii console cheaper

2109
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
And the two staple games

2110
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
If you didn't get them bundled

2111
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
Are now $10 off as well

2112
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
Now I just want to point this out because this is something you're

2113
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Not really reading in the news but you know

2114
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
Loki has ties when it comes to

2115
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
Selling things and he made this little note

2116
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
In our little thread where we always talk

2117
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
About what stories we're going to talk about on the show

2118
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
And so I'm going to pass this little tidbit along

2119
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
Do with it what you will. He says

2120
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
Just the top five direct

2121
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
Nintendo retailers. Not

2122
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
All retailers. This is a

2123
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
Temporary price drop to clear

2124
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
Overstock inventory

2125
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
I wonder why they'd want to

2126
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
Move Wiis

2127
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
Well I mean one

2128
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
Could hypothesize that the new Nintendo console

2129
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
Plays into this but come on

2130
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
That's going to be a year away

2131
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
Although I

2132
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
I don't know. Part of me wants to say why would you

2133
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
Announce a console at E3 when it's not going to come out

2134
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
Till next year but that's exactly what they did with the 3DS

2135
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
So that kind of refutes that

2136
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
But I would think they would try to get it

2137
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
Something out console wise this year

2138
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
But we'll see. I don't know

2139
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
I don't know what this price drop should be tried into

2140
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
Maybe a new bundle. Maybe that's the

2141
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
Route they're going to go. Maybe they're clearing

2142
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
Overstock so they can do some Uber Wii bundle

2143
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
That's going to come out for the holidays

2144
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
In these two games like I just said

2145
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
If you buy them all a cart you can also

2146
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
Get a bundle with them

2147
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
So they're just

2148
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
Kind of taking up space now

2149
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
There's got to be some type of Uber Wii coming out

2150
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
Towards the end of the year

2151
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
Is it called the Wii Wii?

2152
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
None

2153
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
Alright

2154
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
Something you will not be able to play

2155
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
On the Wii but you'll be able to play it on

2156
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
The Xbox 360 and eventually

2157
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
You'll be able to play it on the PlayStation 3

2158
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
But news came out this week that Child of Eden

2159
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
From Q Entertainment has been pushed

2160
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
Back to September on the

2161
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
PlayStation 3. The game is still

2162
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
Coming out on June 14th for the

2163
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
Xbox 360 with Kinect support

2164
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
So why was it pushed back to September?

2165
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
Well they haven't really

2166
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
Said but they have said that it

2167
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
Will now feature move support for the

2168
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
PlayStation so perhaps that is the reason

2169
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
Why it was pushed back was to include the

2170
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
PlayStation Move support

2171
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
I don't know why they bothered

2172
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
They should have just patched that in later because

2173
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
I kind of think the PlayStation Move

2174
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
Is anyone still all about

2175
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
PlayStation Move right now?

2176
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
I mean one could argue is anyone about Kinect right now?

2177
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
But I think there's at least a few people

2178
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
Still dabbling in Dance Central

2179
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
Once in a while at least

2180
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
But as far as the move goes isn't everyone over that?

2181
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
Well maybe Ubisoft was like

2182
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
Yeah Sony so your network

2183
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
Has been down for five days so we're

2184
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
Gonna give you some time to fix that

2185
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
Well to be fair September no I'm kidding

2186
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
I think this news came out before that I know I'm just being an ass

2187
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
Yeah no I know

2188
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
Alright well let's move on

2189
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
To a segment we like to do on the show every

2190
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
Week it's a chance for Dark Soccer to take

2191
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
A trip down memory lane

2192
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
And visit

2193
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
Classic Games from Gaming's Past

2194
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
It's the classic game of

2195
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
The week segment and Dark Soccer

2196
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
Is gonna dive into the vault head first and

2197
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
Find a game that she says hey

2198
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
You little brats

2199
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
This is a classic game you should check out right

2200
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
Freaking now Dark Soccer

2201
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
What is the classic game of the week?

2202
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
The game of the week is called

2203
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
Narbacular Drop

2204
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
And this is a game I have brought up before

2205
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
I see what you're doing here

2206
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
Exactly I figured with Portal 2 coming out

2207
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
It's best to get to the root

2208
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
Alright let's listen to some of the ambience

2209
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
From Narbacular Drop

2210
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
Yeah

2211
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
Hopefully

2212
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
There wasn't a lot of sound in this game I believe

2213
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
But it had some decent music

2214
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
Well

2215
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
At any rate Narbacular Drop is

2216
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
The precursor to

2217
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
Portal it was

2218
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
A free game online in 2005

2219
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
For the PC ran in DirectX 9

2220
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
And it was

2221
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
The senior game project of students

2222
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
Going to DigiPen

2223
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
They actually named it Narbacular Drop

2224
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
Because Narbacular is not really a word

2225
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
And so it would help the thing be found

2226
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
On search engines really easily

2227
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
So basically

2228
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
The whole premise is that

2229
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
There was a princess

2230
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
No knees

2231
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
As in no dash K-N-E-E-S

2232
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
Who is unable to jump

2233
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
She was captured by a demon and imprisoned

2234
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
So she found out that since

2235
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
The prison is actually a

2236
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
Ascension creature named Wally

2237
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
And has a portal making ability she could

2238
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
Escape through using portals

2239
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
So basically

2240
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
It has the whole first person

2241
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
Shooter vibe like Quake

2242
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
But it has the portals in there too

2243
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
You have to solve different puzzles

2244
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
You can definitely see where this led to

2245
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
Portal

2246
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
So you create the different interconnected portals

2247
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
You can actually shoot portals through portals as well

2248
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
Which was very interesting

2249
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
It really helped

2250
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
But you'd have boxes and boulders

2251
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
And things to avoid

2252
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
You have different switches to do

2253
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
That you can't save in the game

2254
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
And it really

2255
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
Is very complex

2256
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
You only have about six puzzles

2257
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
In that because

2258
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
Again, this was a senior project

2259
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
But it's super

2260
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
It's super good, it's actually pretty

2261
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
Pretty fun

2262
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
And so basically

2263
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
The group that developed it

2264
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
Was snatched right up

2265
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
By Valve and said

2266
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
We like this idea, make us portal

2267
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
And they're like, okay

2268
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
Sure, we'd like to do that

2269
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
And uh

2270
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
So they did

2271
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
And uh

2272
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
It's actually

2273
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
You can actually go get this for free

2274
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
It is online

2275
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
It will run on just about any

2276
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
PC and it's

2277
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
Nothing great to look at, it looks like

2278
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
You know

2279
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
Sprightly like Quake

2280
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
Like early Quake and Doom and Hexen

2281
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
Well I mean, it is 3D

2282
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
But it's 3D with sprite

2283
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
Textures. And I think something is important to mention too

2284
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
It looks nothing like Portal. No, it looks nothing

2285
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
Like Portal. It does not have that test chamber look

2286
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
It looks more like a medieval castle type of look

2287
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
And I think that's one very common misconception

2288
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
About Immaculate Drop, is that it looks like Portal

2289
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
It really doesn't. No, it's

2290
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
It's set, you're a princess escaping

2291
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
From a dungeon, trapped by

2292
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
A demon, so

2293
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
The story is different

2294
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
However, the premise is the same

2295
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
You have to use your portals

2296
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
Solve puzzles and get out, while not being

2297
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
You know, jumped on by creatures

2298
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
And falling in the lava

2299
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
And having GLaDOS, wait, wrong game

2300
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
Right

2301
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
So, it's, it's, I've gotten Immaculate Drop

2302
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
I've gotten a few puzzles through it

2303
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
And honestly, it's a little bit harder

2304
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
For me to get through, because early 3D

2305
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
Like that kind of

2306
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
It gives me a headache

2307
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
If that makes sense

2308
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
Like, I can do all the sprite based 3D

2309
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
Like games just fine, but if it's

2310
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
Actual 3D with the sprite based textures

2311
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
Then it makes me kind of sick

2312
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
But, um, it's, it's still

2313
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
A fun little game, I mean, it's free

2314
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
Why not? And

2315
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
I've got it attached to, well I mean you can't

2316
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
Download it through Steam, but I have it attached to my

2317
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
Steam account, so, I just launch it

2318
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
Through that, but, it's, it's a

2319
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
A fun little game, it really is

2320
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
It's just

2321
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
It's a small download

2322
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
It's really

2323
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
Simple, it's just simple and fine

2324
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
That's all, and so if you want to see the origins

2325
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
Of Portal, you should definitely try

2326
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
Immaculate Drop

2327
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
With the little, horribly drawn

2328
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
Story bits at the beginning

2329
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
It's really neat to see, too

2330
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
Like, how freaking far this game

2331
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
Evolved, too, like it just, it

2332
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
You go play Immaculate Drop, it's, it's

2333
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:15,000
Really nothing like Portal

2334
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:16,000
This is six years ago

2335
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
But it's, I mean, it's cool, don't get me wrong

2336
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
It's a cool little game, but it's, uh

2337
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
And the whole point is that

2338
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
The other reason why it was only six

2339
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
Levels is because, number one, it was

2340
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
A final project, but number two, they were trying to

2341
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
Demonstrate that they could establish these physics

2342
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
Within a virtual environment that would

2343
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
Work, so

2344
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
I want to say that the original

2345
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
Way that this was done was by

2346
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
Completely duplicating and re-rendering

2347
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
The room when you threw the Portal

2348
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
But now, with Portal 2,

2349
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
It's just, not with Portal 2, but

2350
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
With the actual Portal, they redid

2351
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
Those, um, those

2352
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
Physics to where it actually would just

2353
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
Respawn you through a particular point

2354
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
I remember, um

2355
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
There's a

2356
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
Something about this on the Portal

2357
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
Commentary, where they were

2358
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
Talking about the difference in, um

2359
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
Programming and what went into

2360
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
You know, what they changed

2361
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
From Immaculate Drop to Portal

2362
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
And how certain things wouldn't carry over

2363
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
And how certain things had to carry over

2364
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
So, it's pretty neat

2365
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
Alright, and Valve is one of the few

2366
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
Major studios that are known

2367
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
To do it quite often

2368
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
To, um, hire

2369
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
Employees from the community

2370
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
Whether it be the Phantom community or to just

2371
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
Go to the studio that made Immaculate Drop and just

2372
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
Say, um, we want to

2373
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
You know, buy your shop and

2374
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
Bring you in for this project, and

2375
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
It's clearly smart, and honestly

2376
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
I think that it's for

2377
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
The best for a lot of companies to really

2378
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
Look toward the new generation coming out and they

2379
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
Give the new people a chance

2380
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
Because

2381
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
With so few

2382
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
New ideas

2383
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
This is my thought

2384
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
People are going to eventually run out of new ideas

2385
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
There's not going to be anything new anymore

2386
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
People are going to think of it all

2387
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
So you need to get a fresh source of

2388
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
Information instead of, you know, people

2389
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
Who are maybe a few years stale

2390
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
So I think it's a great idea

2391
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
Alright

2392
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
They totally get kudos

2393
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
There it is, your classic game of the week, an Arbacular Drop

2394
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
A little bit newer of a game, but certainly

2395
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
With all the brouhaha about

2396
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
Portal 2 this week, it's important to know the roots

2397
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
Of such a landmark game

2398
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
I would seriously like

2399
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
At least five of our listeners

2400
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
To download it and send me an email

2401
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
What you think of it

2402
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
And it's super free, right?

2403
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
You can download it all over the place

2404
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
Alright

2405
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
There it is, and that's usually your classic games of the week

2406
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
Are like obscure fucking Sega titles

2407
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
That'll cost you $100 on eBay

2408
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
This one is free

2409
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
It's in Space Fantasy Zone

2410
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
You can download that online

2411
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week

2412
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
We're going to take a break here live, folks

2413
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
We've got plenty more show to come

2414
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
It's been a pretty busy week, we've got to talk about Mega Man Legends 3

2415
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
There was some news on that this week

2416
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
Talk about, yet again, Guitar Hero

2417
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
Rob, before I forget

2418
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
I am posting the download link in the chatroom

2419
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
Alright, so go download it ASAP

2420
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
And let Dark Soccer know your thoughts

2421
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
Especially if you haven't played before

2422
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
Alright, we're going to take a quick break, guys

2423
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
We'll be back, though, plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio

2424
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
Lots of emails tonight, too, speaking of wanting emails

2425
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
I was looking at the email bag earlier

2426
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
It has built up over the past couple weeks, yay

2427
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
So we get lots of voices tonight

2428
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
And phone calls coming up before the night is over

2429
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
So stay tuned, guys

2430
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
On this Easter Sunday, episode 410 of Orange Lounge Radio

2431
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
We'll be right back after this

2432
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio

2433
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
We are live on this Sunday evening

2434
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
April the 24th of 2011

2435
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
With the 410th episode of our show

2436
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
And, uh, yeah

2437
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
We've been talking about a lot of news tonight

2438
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
There's been a lot of gaming

2439
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
Big games that came out in the last week

2440
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
And, of course, a lot of news to go with that

2441
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
We've got plenty more to cover, though

2442
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
But first, we'll do some plugs for our side projects

2443
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
Some of the other shows that we work on

2444
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
On the side, Dark Sakura, what do you do?

2445
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
You have another little show

2446
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
Well, when we do it

2447
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
We have Comic Insanity

2448
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
Have you been off a couple weeks or something?

2449
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
We've been off for a few weeks because of, you know

2450
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
Stuff going on this week, last week, and the week before

2451
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
So, um

2452
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
But it's what I do with

2453
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
Mar and Marvel, Tiara, and Dan Shadow

2454
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
And we typically

2455
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
Have a new podcast up every Tuesday

2456
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000

2457
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000

01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
And you can also follow us on Twitter

2459
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000

2460
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
So check us out

2461
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
And we'll see you next week

2462
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
Bye people!

2463
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
But not always on

2464
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
It's been a hectic month, you know

2465
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
And besides that, now next month, finals

2466
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
Yikes

2467
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
Well, we've

2468
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
We're still doing the side project I've got going on

2469
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
With Extrovert

2470
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
The best little Horde house in Azeroth

2471
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
Also known as Horde house for short

2472
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
If you like World of Warcraft

2473
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
Or even if you hate it, but you just enjoy

2474
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
Extrovert talking about his Wang

2475
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
And everything

2476
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
And yeah, we were off last week inadvertently

2477
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
We had Comcast go down 30 minutes into the show

2478
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
So we had like a jumbo episode

2479
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
This week, so it's like two hours of wow talk

2480
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
This week, that's a lot of wow

2481
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
Definitely a lot of wow

2482
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
Alright, let's get into some rapid fire news

2483
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
Some quick news stories

2484
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
That we wanted to bring up at some point on tonight's show

2485
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
Loki's gonna start us off

2486
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
Oh wait, he's not here

2487
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
Bob's gonna start us off

2488
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
Well, when you sit in the chair

2489
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
Yeah

2490
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
Bob's gonna start us off cause Loki has the night off

2491
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
Okay, so here's a

2492
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
Feel good human interest story

2493
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
That's gonna make you go aww

2494
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
Skip it

2495
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
A gamer

2496
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
Who goes by the name of Ben

2497
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
I don't know if that's his handle or his real name

2498
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
Started dating

2499
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
A nice young lady

2500
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
And eventually at some point during the relationship

2501
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
When they were hitting it off

2502
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
He gave her the gamer talk

2503
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
If we don't have plans, I'm gonna be parked in front of the TV

2504
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
For hours playing my games

2505
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
And you need to be okay with that

2506
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
And her response was

2507
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
You play Borderlands, right? Fire it up

2508
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
So, yeah

2509
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
So the two of them played all through

2510
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
Borderlands

2511
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
And all of the DLC

2512
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
And I guess Ben went to Gearbox

2513
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
And told him this lovely

2514
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
Story of gamer romance

2515
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
And said that he was going to propose to her

2516
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
And Gearbox

2517
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
Made a video

2518
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
Called Borderlands modest proposal

2519
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
Which you can find on YouTube

2520
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
Where they have their sassy

2521
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
Rude

2522
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
Profanity dropping

2523
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
Mascot

2524
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
Claptrap, he does a

2525
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
Wedding proposal

2526
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
Marriage proposal video

2527
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
For this fan

2528
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
It took him about a week to make it

2529
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
It addresses her by name

2530
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
So Ben was like, hey I want you to look

2531
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
You know

2532
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
Help them get to know each other

2533
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
And then they got divorced in three months

2534
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding

2535
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
See, it's called a Borderlands modest proposal

2536
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
The YouTube channel is

2537
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
Taco Bell manager

2538
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
Yeah

2539
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
Sorry, this is really funny

2540
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
Gearbox helped this loving

2541
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
I hope you like Borderlands and I hope you like

2542
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
Gorditas

2543
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
Because you're going to get a lot of that

2544
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
And I haven't had a chance

2545
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
To watch, it's about a minute and a half

2546
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
And I guess they got their writers to put in some jokes

2547
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
Yeah, so

2548
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
Took them a week to do that?

2549
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
Lord, game companies work slow

2550
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
Alright, I'm just kidding, I'm kidding

2551
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
Okay, so then

2552
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
They got paid in 39 cent tacos

2553
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
Next we have a story about

2554
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
YouTube video sensation

2555
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
Freddy Wong

2556
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
And I look through his channel and I don't recognize

2557
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
Stuff, but

2558
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
He put out a character

2559
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
I guess he's a computer animator

2560
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
And he does a lot of, you know

2561
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
YouTube mini movies

2562
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
And he put out a character called

2563
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
Mr. Toots

2564
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
Mr. Toots is a tiny

2565
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
Knee high unicorn

2566
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
And this here, it's half

2567
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
It's half live action, half CGI

2568
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
And Freddy Wong

2569
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
Finds Mr. Toots in a cardboard box

2570
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
Out on the street, and Mr. Toots

2571
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
Is a little knee high unicorn that

2572
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
Shoots rainbows out of its ass

2573
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
So those of you that are in

2574
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
Robot unicorn attack

2575
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
Are just rainbow unicorn

2576
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
Fandom hilariousness

2577
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
Oh, I love rainbow unicorns

2578
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
This is that guy that did that

2579
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
Portal video

2580
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
The portal gun delivery

2581
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
I'm looking at the video here

2582
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
So here's the, he lifts up the box

2583
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
And there's the little

2584
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
I'm like two seconds behind you

2585
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
Creepy looking unicorn

2586
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
Aw, there's the unicorn

2587
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
Hey, looks like we got a car coming

2588
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
So let's get out of the road, huh?

2589
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
My favorite is the dude exploding in like the

2590
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
Mortal Kombat blood all over it

2591
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
The skeleton

2592
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
So this is gaming related

2593
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
Because it turns out that Mr. Toots

2594
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
Has been copyrighted and registered

2595
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
To Volition Inc

2596
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
The developer behind

2597
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
THQ's Red Faction

2598
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
And Saints Row series

2599
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
So whether the character came first

2600
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
And the THQ snatched it up

2601
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
Or he was commissioned for this little dude

2602
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
Um, we're like

2603
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
What on earth

2604
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
Is this, is Volition gonna do with this character?

2605
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
This guy actually

2606
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
Borrowed the model

2607
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
He credits him in the end of the video

2608
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
Borrowed the model from somebody

2609
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
So it could be like some cross promotion

2610
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
And see I love this joke in our chatroom from Randy

2611
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
Cause somebody had to make this joke

2612
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
chat.orangestonshoot.com

2613
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
Mr. Toots and the pink anus

2614
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
Remember the magical unicorn game on Steam with the

2615
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
Pink anus

2616
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
A-E-N-U-S that you buy as a material

2617
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
Yeah, lots of anus going on in this game

2618
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
Oh yeah, so it does look like

2619
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
That Mr. Toots came from THQ first

2620
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
And then this Freddie Wong guy

2621
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
Did the promotional thing for it

2622
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
You know what's funny about the anus?

2623
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
What? Everything's funny about anus

2624
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
I always get it confused with this candy

2625
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
In Japan called A-S-S-E

2626
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
I guess it's A-SE or A-S-ER

2627
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
Uh huh, but it looks like ass

2628
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
When you get it out of the box

2629
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
Mmm, tastes like ass

2630
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
So yeah

2631
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
The biggest part of this story is just the whole

2632
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
What factor and the fact that it's from

2633
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
Volition, so where are they gonna

2634
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
Drop this dude? Maybe he'll be

2635
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
A playable character in Saints Row 3

2636
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
You know, you're running

2637
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
You're on drug missions and instead of

2638
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
Getting an Uzi you're just shooting rainbows out of your ass

2639
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
At people, I don't know

2640
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
Ass

2641
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
Thank you to our soccer for derailing the show with ass

2642
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
And my last

2643
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
Quickfire story is even though

2644
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
Activision has pulled the plug on the

2645
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
XYZ

2646
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
Hero franchises

2647
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
With guitar or DJ

2648
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
It looks like DJ Hero 2 is getting

2649
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
At least one more

2650
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
DLC pack, not sure if it's the last

2651
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
But it's still getting content

2652
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
And it's a UltraMix pack by

2653
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
I'm blanking

2654
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
I just had it up here

2655
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
Deadmau5, sorry

2656
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
Deadmau5 is putting out a

2657
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
Three song

2658
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
Track pack for DJ Hero 2

2659
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
House Music by Benny Benassi

2660
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
Sophie Needs a Ladder by Deadmau5

2661
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
And We Speak No Americano

2662
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
By YolandaBeCool and

2663
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
DCUP

2664
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
CUP

2665
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
Womp womp

2666
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
You're gross

2667
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
Anything else?

2668
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
That's it for me

2669
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
Let's go to the other music game that comes up once in a while

2670
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
On this program, it used to come up a lot on this program

2671
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
BeatMania 2DX

2672
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
Is having its 19th

2673
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
Version being tested

2674
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
It's called Linkle

2675
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
Not sure what that's supposed to mean

2676
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
It's L-I-N-C-L-E, Linkle

2677
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
It kinda looks like Uncle

2678
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
But with the U kinda, I think it'll be a better name

2679
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
BeatMania 2DX 19, Uncle

2680
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
Uncle! Make it stop

2681
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
These songs don't sound the same

2682
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
What was 17 and 18? It was like Duchess, Empress

2683
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
One was Empress, you got it

2684
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
Empress was one, and then the other one was Sirius

2685
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
But not like the radio, it's the

2686
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
Constellation in the sky

2687
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
So this one is Linkle

2688
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
And I don't know, it kinda has like a sci-fi

2689
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
Theme going on, whatever

2690
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
Some of the new games, or some of the new songs

2691
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
That are coming out in it, I don't, I don't even recognize

2692
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
These bands anymore, like I used to be so into

2693
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
This series. Sota Fujimori

2694
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
I remember him with a song called Lucky Days

2695
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
Let's see, Chorus K,

2696
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
Drive Me Crazy

2697
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
I remember

2698
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
Dark Tetsuya was saying something in the

2699
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
Thread about a song called F

2700
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
Or something like that

2701
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
From like, you know, just like, oh there it is

2702
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
DJ Amuro doing F

2703
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
He did the song A

2704
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
Now he's moved on to other letters of the alphabet

2705
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
So we get a song called F

2706
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
Some of the other things that are coming to

2707
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
2DX 19th style, as I will forever call it

2708
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
A light blue theme

2709
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
Apparently in the game

2710
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
Song previews have been added

2711
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
For normal gameplay mode, that's pretty cool

2712
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
So you can actually hear what the song sounds like

2713
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
Finally, 19 games later

2714
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
Let's see, a hard EX

2715
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
Option added

2716
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
It is even harder than hard

2717
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
That's a direct quote, harder than hard

2718
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
And some songs, unfortunately

2719
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
Have been removed from the game

2720
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
Because, you know, they have to delete

2721
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
Old songs to make room for the new ones

2722
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
Luckily, because I don't follow the series anymore

2723
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
I don't recognize any of these songs that they've removed

2724
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
But there you go, Beat Media 2DX

2725
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
Linkle. Now, I would care about

2726
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
Beat Media 2DX again if they would put out the home versions

2727
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
Because, especially if they came out on PlayStation 3

2728
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
Yeah, PlayStation 3

2729
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
Because it's not region coded

2730
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
And you have your controllers that we

2731
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
Packed, and I want to play those

2732
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
We're already getting Tingle things in the chat room

2733
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
By the way

2734
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
Tingle and Linkle? Nice

2735
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
You know, Tingle

2736
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
If Tingle and Link had a baby

2737
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
It would be Linkle

2738
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
BlackWolf in our chat room says

2739
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
2DX lives on where Guitar Hero dies

2740
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
Well, in Japan anyway

2741
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
But you don't really see anything about it here

2742
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
They should have an insane 4 controller

2743
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
Version where you use your toes

2744
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
Beat Media 2DX was a lot of fun

2745
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
It really was, I just, I don't know

2746
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
Bring back the Effector Pedal

2747
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
Like, two arcades have it anymore

2748
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
You know, Arcade Infinity is gone

2749
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
You can go to, what, Sunnyvale Golf Line

2750
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
Or Milpitas? One of the two still has it

2751
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
And they got rid of ours

2752
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
That's one arcade in the Bay Area

2753
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
They probably have the one that RVGL got rid of

2754
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
Maybe

2755
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
That's so stupid, they didn't get rid of 2DX

2756
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
Dr. Suya says they deleted Power Dream

2757
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
I did like that song

2758
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
You know what, we just need to

2759
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
Have a Bimani party

2760
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
No, we don't

2761
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
Unless you're going to kick it like it's, you know

2762
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
2002 all over again

2763
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
Well, after three songs

2764
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
And we're all covered in sweat because we're not in the shape

2765
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
That we used to be in doing 9 footer songs

2766
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
No, and that's just from playing 2DX

2767
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
Nice

2768
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
Alright, some other things

2769
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
An Xbox exclusive

2770
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
Mortal Kombat fighter was discussed

2771
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
According to Ed Boon

2772
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
Saying, quote, unfortunately the circumstances

2773
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
Didn't allow us to make a 360 exclusive

2774
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
Character. I'm not allowed to talk

2775
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
Too much about it, but I can tell you we certainly

2776
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
Wanted to do an exclusive for 360

2777
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
But that's all I can say

2778
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
And unfortunately that's leaving everybody to

2779
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
Try and guess, what could the

2780
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
Character have been?

2781
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
Well, I can't really think of that many

2782
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
Iconic, Microsoft licensed

2783
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
Only characters they have

2784
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
Because Kratos obviously is a Sony only

2785
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
Property, he's very recognizable

2786
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
One of the Gears of War dudes

2787
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
Marcus Fenix

2788
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
Master Chief, which would be kind of dumb

2789
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
In that universe, because at least Kratos has got

2790
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
The whole medieval and the blades

2791
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
Right, how about that chick from

2792
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
Cameo, what's she doing these days?

2793
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
That could have been the character

2794
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
She's playing Uno with the Kameo

2795
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
Uno pack, that's it

2796
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
Or a nondescript dude from Fable

2797
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
I think probably what Microsoft had a problem

2798
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
With was the fatalities

2799
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
And it's, you know, to have your character

2800
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
Die a horrible death

2801
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
Is something that's

2802
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
Hard for some people

2803
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
God of War already had the rendered

2804
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
Guts and the eviscerations and the titties

2805
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
For no reason, so Kratos is at home

2806
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
In Mortal Kombat

2807
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
Microsoft doesn't really have

2808
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
A character like that, unless chat can think

2809
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
Of one that we're forgetting

2810
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
Unless, you know, I don't see them

2811
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
Splitting Master Chief in half

2812
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
And his little midsection

2813
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
It's gross, some of those fatalities are gross

2814
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
Which, by the way, I am gonna try and get that video

2815
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
Of my mom playing Mortal Kombat, just so you know

2816
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
Working on that

2817
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
I told her about the project today

2818
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
She's like, what?

2819
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
So I don't know what character it could have possibly been

2820
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
I mean, if it had been Marcus Fenix or something

2821
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
I think the problem would have been with the fatalities

2822
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
That's why they had to change up DC Universe

2823
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
But, I mean, it's one thing

2824
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
To do it for a single Xbox character

2825
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
It's another to change the game for

2826
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
DC Universe, I mean, that's why they

2827
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
Or, I'm sorry, THE DC Universe

2828
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
I'm gonna be confused with the game DC Universe

2829
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
You know what I mean, though

2830
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
One other quick thing I want to say

2831
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
It's about the 3DS Ocarina of Time

2832
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
We all know that game is coming out on the 3DS

2833
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
That's another big thing they're gonna pimp for this holiday season

2834
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
There's gonna be a new feature in the game

2835
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
Called the Boss Challenge Mode

2836
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
It's an all fighting mode

2837
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
You go up against any of the bosses you've encountered on the main quest

2838
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
You can take on the bosses individually

2839
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
Or all at once in a continuous battle

2840
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
That's all we know

2841
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
One little unlock feature that'll be in the game

2842
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
Is an extra mode

2843
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
Kinda sounds a little silly to me

2844
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
But I guess whatever extra crap they can throw in there

2845
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
To make it seem worth it again

2846
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
They will do, so we'll see

2847
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
DarkSakura, you got a few stories for us?

2848
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
I have a few

2849
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
Konami Style, which is notable for often having

2850
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
Pretty expensive stuff up there

2851
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
Remember the arcade style 2DX

2852
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
And pop and music controllers?

2853
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
Well, they have a

2854
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
$380 Pyramid Head

2855
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
Sculpture now

2856
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
Tomopop

2857
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
Is basically saying this is the only

2858
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
Officially licensed Pyramid Head

2859
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
To date

2860
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
The actual price is

2861
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
31,500 yen

2862
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
Or about 382 bucks

2863
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
And it's a pretty sick looking figure

2864
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
I gotta say

2865
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
He's all wearing his

2866
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
Skin

2867
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
Outfit with the big

2868
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
Pyramid on his head

2869
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
And the great knife

2870
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
Is actually specifically Silent Hill

2871
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
Homecoming

2872
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
So it looks pretty cool, and I'm gonna show

2873
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
Our chat room what it looks like

2874
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
None of you get to see hahahahaha

2875
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
There you go

2876
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
Chat room

2877
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
Can I jump in with some comments real quick

2878
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
About Mortal Kombat specifically

2879
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
Some ideas from the chat room

2880
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
About who that missing Mortal Kombat character

2881
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
Could have been

2882
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
Randy suggests Larry Erb

2883
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
Come on, it's not supposed to be real people

2884
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
Let's see

2885
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
Defective Candy suggests Clippy

2886
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
The Microsoft Help character

2887
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
I like that idea

2888
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
And then Black Wolf says

2889
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
That the Wii character

2890
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
Could have been Woohoo Island

2891
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
Could have been the character in the game

2892
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
Because imagine how that fatality would have worked

2893
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
The fatality would have been you would have had to run

2894
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
Like in Wii Fit

2895
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
I don't know

2896
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
Imagine Mario and Luigi in a Mortal Kombat game now

2897
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
Where they take a monkey wrench and just

2898
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
Show it through someone's throat

2899
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
All these angry parents writing letters

2900
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
Like I just, I love it

2901
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
I don't know

2902
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
Sorry Jamie, I just had to get that out there

2903
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
I love the Clippy one too much

2904
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
That's a good idea for a character

2905
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
Microsoft Bob

2906
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
Awesome figure, awesome figure is awesome

2907
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
And

2908
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
In Portal 2, the little

2909
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
Egg shaped turrets have an easter egg

2910
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
I have not heard this

2911
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
So I'm going to have to check it out

2912
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
Myself later, but it's on YouTube

2913
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
You guys can check it out

2914
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
Should I be bringing this up here?

2915
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
Um, if you like

2916
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
I'll go read the next story while you do that

2917
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
I got it, I got it, I got it

2918
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
What, this is a little song they sing?

2919
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
What is this?

2920
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
It looks like around level 16

2921
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
Trying to see if I recognize this level

2922
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:26,000
Let me skip ahead a little bit

2923
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
The turrets serenading you

2924
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
Is an event that happens later in the game

2925
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
I remember seeing this part

2926
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
In one of the levels

2927
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
Where the turrets were like unreachable

2928
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
This part looks familiar to me

2929
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
But I don't remember them singing like this

2930
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
Weird

2931
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
Alright, anyway

2932
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
It would be funny if

2933
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
When you're doing the defective turrets

2934
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
If you could get one that sings instead of the

2935
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
I'm a turret, huh

2936
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
Turret

2937
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
All of the lethal functioning turrets are female

2938
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
But the incompetent dunce turrets are male

2939
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
But there's

2940
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
Well, and the same goes with Wheatley

2941
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
Yeah

2942
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
But I've noticed that

2943
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
Actually something that they pointed out in the first Portal

2944
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
Is that there's so much

2945
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
Female oriented

2946
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
Stuff in the game like

2947
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
Bring your daughter to work day

2948
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
And GLaDOS being female

2949
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
And the main character being female

2950
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
So they're just keeping up with that theme

2951
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
Yeah, go Pawa

2952
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
It's like the Silent Hill movie

2953
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
Before they added the needless character

2954
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
Sean Bean

2955
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
So

2956
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
More Portal 2 information

2957
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
Is actually for PC and Mac

2958
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
On Steam there are some

2959
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
Fixed patch that will

2960
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
Fix unrecoverable black screen

2961
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
In the elevator save

2962
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
Fixed infinite loop on

2963
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
Mac OS X server

2964
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
Fixed Mac OS X font rendering

2965
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
And glyph corruption

2966
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
Fixed GC memory leak various location

2967
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
Content improvements

2968
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
Support for English subtitles and Turkish builds

2969
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
Because people in Turkey love their Portal

2970
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
Minor string interface glitches

2971
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
Fixes for multiple crashes

2972
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
Improved detection handling

2973
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
Various errors and or crashes

2974
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
Activated UI to enable joystick in game

2975
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
That's pretty cool

2976
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
However it

2977
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
Did get a 10 out of 10

2978
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
From Eurogamer so

2979
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
I think it's pretty sweet

2980
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
It's sick

2981
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
And that's it

2982
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
Nice

2983
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
I was gonna say part of the reason

2984
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
That they had to give the

2985
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
Turkish language support

2986
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
That Hakan from Street Fighter 4 threatened

2987
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
To kick their ass if they didn't add that

2988
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
He was gonna threaten to oil himself up and send nude photos

2989
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
Yes he was gonna oil himself up and send

2990
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
Nude pictures if that didn't happen

2991
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
Let's go to the Twitter

2992
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
Get some Twitter topics, actually shit I forgot to ask

2993
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
For them so we may not have anything on Twitter

2994
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
But let's see what happens if I go to the Twitter

2995
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
Twitter.com slash OLR and let's see what happens

2996
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
When Rob forgets to request these things

2997
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
Let's see if we got anything anyway

2998
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
Let's see, logging into Twitter

2999
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
Clearly I'm prepared for this

3000
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
Segment tonight, Twitter.com slash OLR

3001
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
Oh we do, oh we do have some tweets

3002
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
Look at this, uh let's see

3003
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
Redertainment says

3004
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
On Twitter, given her biting

3005
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
Yet funny insults

3006
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
How do you think GLaDOS would deliver a

3007
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
Yomana joke, I think he meant to say

3008
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
Yo mama, but he typed Yomana

3009
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
Which is actually really funny, I don't know why

3010
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
It would be this, your mother is dead

3011
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
Yeah

3012
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
That's very good

3013
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
I like that, I like that

3014
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
There's a joke in there, alright

3015
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
SSJ100Matt is on

3016
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
Twitter saying

3017
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
Hey it's Easter, what ever happened to Pete

3018
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
Jousting, also what's your

3019
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
favorite totally not kosher for

3020
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
Passover Easter candy

3021
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
Oh good question

3022
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
Waffles

3023
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
I couldn't have waffles

3024
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
I wanted waffles so bad

3025
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
What ever happened to

3026
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
Pete Jousting, actually I was trying to explain

3027
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
Pete Jousting to my mother this morning

3028
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
Right, remember I was explaining

3029
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
You brought it up

3030
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
Yeah there's a very

3031
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
Like

3032
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
You're either

3033
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
Someone that doesn't mind peeps or will eat them

3034
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
Or you think they're the most vile

3035
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
Fucking candy on the base of the earth

3036
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
Yeah so we

3037
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
Brought up peeps at this

3038
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
Easter breakfast and

3039
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
Rob's mom and I think

3040
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
Aunt

3041
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
You say the two relatives were like

3042
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
Peeps

3043
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
Like cousin in law

3044
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
So they were going through their whole

3045
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
Peeps are gross rant and we mentioned

3046
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
Peep Jousting

3047
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
That was after my cousin's son

3048
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
Who's 9 years old was threatening to

3049
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
Look up the show on the internet so God I hope

3050
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
He didn't find it

3051
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
So you need to turn it off

3052
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
Your mother's gonna

3053
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
Mother's gonna kick your butt

3054
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
I'm surprised that there wasn't

3055
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
More bacon at the

3056
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
Event

3057
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
Let's not get into that

3058
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
But yeah Peep Jousting I don't know

3059
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
I haven't done Peep Jousting in a long time

3060
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
What about the other part of the question

3061
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
What's your favorite totally not kosher for passover

3062
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
Easter candy

3063
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
The problem with that is that

3064
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
Candy would be okay as long as it's not

3065
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
Made with flour

3066
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
You know like something with a crust

3067
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
Pocky

3068
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
Yeah you could have Pocky

3069
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
But I don't really think of Pocky as

3070
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
Easter

3071
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
My favorite Easter candy

3072
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
Would be jelly beans that aren't

3073
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
Jelly belly like and I can only

3074
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
Really eat them around Easter because

3075
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
I can't eat them everyday

3076
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
You don't like the gelatin stuff

3077
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
Anyway you can't really eat that stuff but I like

3078
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
Regular jelly beans especially the black ones

3079
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
That are just pure licorice

3080
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
Barf black licorice barf

3081
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
Barf

3082
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
I'll pick the black ones out of whatever

3083
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
You can't have milk chocolate while you're

3084
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
Having fried chicken

3085
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
But I can really only eat them at Easter time

3086
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
I can't eat them other time of the year

3087
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
Jelly belly is the rest of the year

3088
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
Is all I can eat

3089
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
Now I'm imagining chocolate covered

3090
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
Chicken and that would just be gross

3091
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
Go to any state fair in the south

3092
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
Well you're from the south you know

3093
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
It would be chocolate covered chicken deep fried

3094
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
In like bacon fat

3095
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
Ew

3096
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
Alright we got some other uh

3097
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
Oh I will tell you one thing

3098
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
My friend made bacon brownies

3099
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
I see that

3100
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
I told her that when all this is over

3101
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
She used to make me some turkey bacon brownies

3102
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
Uh what about you? So I just popped

3103
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
Favorite Easter candy?

3104
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
Uh the Reese's peanut butter cup eggs

3105
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
Just cause it's just a big flat

3106
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
Peanut butter cup and those are amazing

3107
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
You know what I don't like are cream eggs

3108
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
Gross

3109
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
People worship those things but they are too

3110
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
Much they are too much

3111
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
The mini they have those mini

3112
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
Cream eggs now those I can eat

3113
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
Touch of Britain sells Mars eggs

3114
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
Marzipan?

3115
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
No Mars bars eggs

3116
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
And they also have um these uh

3117
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
Dark chocolate truffle eggs

3118
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
Cause there are all kind of cream eggs

3119
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
Sold you know in England and these

3120
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
Are just they're all Cadbury

3121
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
The ones that they carry they also have the um

3122
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
The

3123
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
Galaxy ones

3124
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
They sell those too and the arrow ones

3125
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
They're all puffed air chocolate eggs

3126
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
So good anyway I need to go get my

3127
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
Mars egg let me get some more tweets

3128
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
Flaming toilet is tweeting us

3129
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
Upgrading to a new swim swim

3130
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
A new slim PlayStation 3

3131
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
And tired of waiting for PSN to come

3132
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
Back is it okay to do

3133
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
Data transfer utility or do I

3134
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
Risk losing data?

3135
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
I don't know I have no idea

3136
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
Data transfer between his old

3137
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
System and his new one? That's what I'm assuming

3138
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
Okay uh like kind of like a license

3139
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
Transfer I'm assuming like what you do on 360

3140
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
I've never had to do that before uh

3141
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
I wouldn't risk it like honestly

3142
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
Right now not a good time to try that cause it

3143
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
Depending on when

3144
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
His slim was

3145
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
Manufactured and put on the shelves

3146
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
He's probably a few OS

3147
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
Updates behind and that

3148
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
Once he actually gets the slim

3149
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
Online it's like oh we need to update you to

3150
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
Point six I don't know what number they're on

3151
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
And that might invalidate his certificates

3152
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
So just wait

3153
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
Good point yeah you're gonna have to wait it out sorry

3154
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
Uh and let's see

3155
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
One more tweet from TigerCloth305

3156
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
On Twitter says it's a tweet

3157
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
The DS Lite is going to be discontinued

3158
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
Uh yeah that was some news

3159
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
That was circulating this week is that the DS Lite

3160
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
Is no more and he's linking

3161
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
Us to a story on oneup.com

3162
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
That apparently references a NeoGaf post

3163
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
Where there is documents going out

3164
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
Uh Nintendo is not offering

3165
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
Any comment on this right now

3166
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
But I guess some of the older DS's are

3167
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
Being discontinued which makes sense I mean

3168
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
Well I think every person

3169
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
In the developed world

3170
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
Has one

3171
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
Including their pets

3172
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,000
Like my cat has a DS Lite I'm kidding

3173
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
But no I think yeah that's

3174
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
They're pretty um

3175
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
Prevalent

3176
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
Yeah and they're not getting

3177
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
Rid of the DSi or the

3178
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
DS XL that's important to know

3179
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,000
And I still want one of those too but yeah

3180
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,000
So there's no why why not just get the 3DS

3181
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
I don't know those screens are big

3182
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
It's well the 3DS is backwards compatible

3183
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
With the regular DS right

3184
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
But not the advanced games

3185
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
So you like must play Game Boy advanced games

3186
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
Well they haven't had the GBA port on the DS

3187
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
In a while oh that's right they got rid of

3188
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
That with the DSi yeah so I guess that's the

3189
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
One thing you're losing with the DS Lite

3190
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
No more Game Boy advanced games

3191
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
So there you go

3192
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
Let's see one more tweet

3193
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
Tigerclaw got in one more and why not

3194
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
I'll go ahead and read this one

3195
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
Chrono Trigger apparently is

3196
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
Also coming out so I guess this is in the same

3197
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
Vain as the Final Fantasy 6 thing we heard about earlier

3198
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
Apparently Chrono Trigger for the

3199
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
PlayStation 3 and PSP

3200
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
Was outed by an ESRB listing

3201
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
So this is probably just right in that

3202
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
Up the same alley as Final Fantasy 6

3203
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
Because Chrono Trigger was released for the

3204
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
PlayStation 1

3205
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
Yeah so this is yeah the

3206
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
What was that called was it the Final Fantasy

3207
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
Chronicles that had Chrono Trigger in it?

3208
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
Chronicles yeah the other one was the Anthology

3209
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
Yeah so um

3210
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
It's probably just obviously a port of that

3211
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
Because that's already been out on Sony the

3212
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
DS port with the extra

3213
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
Dungeon and the endings and stuff

3214
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
Is probably still the better

3215
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
Chrono Trigger

3216
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,000
Release that you'd want to

3217
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
Get rather than this one but

3218
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
Give us a legit Chrono Trigger sequel already

3219
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
Like I know there's Chrono Cross but I mean

3220
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,000
Seriously how long ago was that?

3221
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,000
Damn Square

3222
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
Everybody loses their shit

3223
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
Over that game and yet we still don't have

3224
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
Like something in that canon

3225
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
It's weird one of the reasons why I still

3226
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
Want a DS XL is because

3227
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
Chrono Trigger

3228
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
Port on the DS

3229
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
I can see it fine it's not like I'm blind but

3230
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,000
Just those sprites I want them on a bigger screen

3231
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
So fair enough

3232
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
Alright let's move on with some more

3233
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
Gaming news and then we're gonna get to your

3234
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
Phone calls before too long and emails

3235
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
We have lots of emails tonight can't wait to do that

3236
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
Dark Soccer's gotta work tonight

3237
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
Yay alright

3238
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
Slaces pop more news

3239
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
So after that

3240
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,000
A couple weeks ago we

3241
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
Announced that the Mega Man

3242
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
Project that Capcom was working on

3243
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
Was scrapped but they're still

3244
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
From what we understand working on Mega Man

3245
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
Legends 3 that has a huge

3246
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
Fandom that really wants that game to come out

3247
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
The Capcom

3248
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
Has announced that they are putting out

3249
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
A Mega Man Legends 3

3250
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
Prototype version which is

3251
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
Sort of a beta

3252
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
Slash demo it's

3253
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
I'm not sure if it's gonna have a full

3254
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
Start to finish or it's a separate episode

3255
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
That may not necessarily be in the full release of the game

3256
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
But it's just

3257
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
What they have compiled that runs

3258
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
Well they're gonna put it out

3259
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
For the 3DS

3260
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
And on their eShop

3261
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
It's supposed to hit in late May

3262
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
And there's a playable

3263
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
Character named Barrett

3264
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
And it offers a few missions

3265
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
Not to be confused with the first person ever to

3266
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
Say shit in Final Fantasy

3267
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
Just so you know

3268
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
So you play as Barrett and it's gonna have a few missions

3269
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
Though it's probably gonna be spammed

3270
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,000
With loading screen messages

3271
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
That just say this is not a finished product

3272
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
This is a game in progress any bugs blah blah blah

3273
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
So yeah we're gonna get

3274
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
Something for Legends 3

3275
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
But yet you're gonna have to pay for it right?

3276
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
Let's see

3277
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
Quickly let me throw this out here

3278
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
It's going on the eShop

3279
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
Let me throw this out here to a little follow up to that

3280
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
Is that you know I guess Capcom isn't

3281
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
Really sold on this whole thing

3282
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
So they are saying that we need

3283
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
Interest we need participation

3284
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
From fans or this game could be axed

3285
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
At any second like for some reason

3286
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
I'm just reminded of like when Tinkerbell

3287
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000
Is dying clap if you want

3288
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,000
To save me just clap clap louder

3289
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
Clap louder and say I believe in fairies

3290
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,000
I believe in fairies that's that's literally what

3291
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
Capcom is saying you need to clap

3292
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,000
And say I believe in Mega Man

3293
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
I believe in Mega Man and then give us your money

3294
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
Is basically what they're saying so

3295
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
They have come out and said in a blog post

3296
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,000
On Capcom Unity Masakazu

3297
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
Eguchi the director of the game

3298
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
Said the prototype version that's coming out

3299
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,000
On the 3DS is based

3300
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
On the prototype that they made

3301
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,000
To prove to Capcom that the game could

3302
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,000
Happen the heat and excitement surrounding

3303
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000
This downloadable title would determine

3304
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
Whether or not the full game could be greenlit

3305
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
If hype is strong the full title

3306
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
Will be a go if not

3307
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,000
It's a no go

3308
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,000
Clap clap I'm dying

3309
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,000
I believe in fairies I believe

3310
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
This doesn't mention if there's

3311
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
Going to be MSRP

3312
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
Extra Mega Man costume $2

3313
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
So if you want

3314
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
Legends 3 if this thing

3315
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,000
Costs money and it's basically a glorified

3316
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
Beta that's kind of lame

3317
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
Yeah pick it up

3318
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
They're tracking heavily the response to this

3319
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
So now not only do we have pay to unlock

3320
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
Content but we have pay demos

3321
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000
Pay to finish developing

3322
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
You want us to fix those

3323
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
Clipping issues or you know

3324
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
The game crashes if you try to

3325
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
Walk backwards you know

3326
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
Slip a little

3327
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
Like a 20 we'll figure it out

3328
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
Alright

3329
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
Well I guess to be fair the

3330
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
Gran Turismo 5 prologue

3331
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
Was kind of the same thing

3332
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
It kind of sounds like where this is going except we always knew

3333
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
There would be a Gran Turismo 5 eventually

3334
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
Although was Bobby ever

3335
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,000
Convinced that Gran Turismo 5 came out?

3336
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
I'm not sure hopefully he's in chat and can let us know

3337
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
Anyway a follow up to a story from a couple weeks ago

3338
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
I remember when there was that awesome Streets of Rage

3339
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
Remake that they've been like making for like 8

3340
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,000
Years and they put it out on the internet and we were

3341
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
Talking about it how like hey they finally get

3342
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
To put out the Streets of Rage remake you remember that

3343
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
Dark Sakura? Yeah

3344
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
Dark Sakura updated graphics well guess how long that

3345
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
Lasted? 5 seconds

3346
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
That's right the link

3347
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
Was taken down of course

3348
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
Now that it's out on the internet it's not that hard to

3349
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
Find but the official link was taken down

3350
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
And after some proking and prodding they did

3351
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
Admit Sega has contacted

3352
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
Regarding the download hosted on this site

3353
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
While this issue is being resolved

3354
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
Please do not upload the game for others to download

3355
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
Right any links posted on

3356
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
This site will be removed thank you

3357
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
Now apparently they were kind of

3358
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
Asked well didn't you like try to get this cleared with

3359
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
Sega or what's going on?

3360
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
Bomberlink who's the project leader on the progress

3361
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
Said they did contact Sega

3362
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
I would like to say this is a quote from him

3363
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
I would like to say that we did actually

3364
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
Contact Sega last year through an email message

3365
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
Regarding the use of copyrighted material

3366
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
To which they answered asking us to send

3367
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
A formal letter to their legal department

3368
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
So that's what we did we accepted the ESA

3369
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
Policies regarding the DMCA as well

3370
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
Otherwise this website would not exist

3371
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,000
Anymore

3372
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,000
There you go

3373
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
They had to take it down cause Sega didn't like it

3374
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
Eight years that thing was in the making

3375
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
And you know Sega is just trying to really

3376
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
Utilize that Streets of Rage license

3377
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
Right now it's a big IP for them

3378
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
A part of you know trademark

3379
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
Law is you have to pursue

3380
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
Every infraction against

3381
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
Your brand even if you're not doing anything

3382
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
With it or else you could lose

3383
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
The trademark to be fair

3384
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
Because I'm sure someone in chat will bring it up

3385
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
They have released the Streets of Rage 2

3386
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
Something on the iPhone, iPad

3387
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
So they are still trying to cash in on

3388
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
Genesis nostalgia as they have for the past

3389
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
15 years on various

3390
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
You know consoles and Streets of Rage was in that

3391
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
Awesome like the best Genesis nostalgia

3392
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,000
Of them all that Sonic Omega collection

3393
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
Thing that was on PS3 that's super

3394
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
Cheap and Xbox

3395
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,000
So yeah this isn't unfortunate to hear because

3396
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
The community obviously really cares about it

3397
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
And have to take eight years to put this out

3398
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
But the fact that they were C&D'd is

3399
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
Sort of I know seems like a duh

3400
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
But do we mention

3401
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
About the whole Sega building in San Francisco

3402
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
Now belongs to Zynga

3403
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
We did bring that up on the show huh

3404
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
Speaking of sad stories

3405
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
Sad sad stories

3406
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
I didn't know Zynga owned

3407
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,000
Words With Friends now either

3408
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
Zynga's the

3409
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
I stopped playing Words With Friends you know why

3410
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
Because everybody wants to fucking play Words With Friends

3411
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
And then it's like my phone keeps going off

3412
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
Every two seconds

3413
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
Your move with Dark Sakura

3414
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:05,000
Random people you didn't know right

3415
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:07,000
Were trying to start new games with you

3416
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:09,000
Fuck Words With Friends

3417
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,000
It's a terrible game

3418
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,000
Yeah I said it

3419
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:15,000
Get a Scrabble board you'll have more fun

3420
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,000
Then you can yell at somebody in person

3421
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,000
It's much more satisfying

3422
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:21,000
Rather than Words With Friends play out

3423
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:23,000
Everybody fucking cheats at Words With Friends anyway

3424
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:25,000
You know there's an app that you can actually buy

3425
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:29,000
One of my managers at work was showing me

3426
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,000
How to do this by the way

3427
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:33,000
A screenshot of the screen from Words With Friends

3428
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:35,000
And then upload it to this other app

3429
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:37,000
And it just cheats

3430
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:39,000
When I was playing a lot of Yahoo

3431
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:41,000
Literati

3432
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,000
There was a JavaScript

3433
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:45,000
Website that was in Anagram Finder

3434
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:47,000
Where you would put in your

3435
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:49,000
Yahoo Literati URL and it would say

3436
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:51,000
Oh here's your word

3437
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:53,000
You're a cheater?

3438
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:55,000
You are a cheater?

3439
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:57,000
You cheated on Yahoo Literati?

3440
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,000
You're going to hell

3441
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:01,000
I can however say that

3442
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:03,000
I have not cheated at Scrabulous

3443
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:05,000
I miss Scrabulous

3444
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:07,000
What's Scrabulous?

3445
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:09,000
Scrabulous became Lexulous because

3446
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,000
Scrabble or whatever

3447
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:13,000
Is that on Facebook?

3448
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:15,000
Ah fuck that game too

3449
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,000
Well I don't play it on Facebook

3450
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:19,000
But I used to play it when it was Scrabulous

3451
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:21,000
And it had Scrabble Solitaire

3452
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:23,000
Now it's like it makes you play with people

3453
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,000
And I hate that because Scrabble Solitaire is super fun

3454
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:27,000
Where basically you just play until you're out of words

3455
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:29,000
That's your score

3456
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:31,000
Are there any fun Facebook games right now?

3457
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:33,000
I've been going in and deleting

3458
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:35,000
Just about all of my apps

3459
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:37,000
There's seriously nothing I play on Facebook

3460
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:39,000
I got sick of Knights of the Clicky

3461
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:41,000
I'm sure I have like 4 trillion blood points in Vampire Wars

3462
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:43,000
That I haven't touched in 3 years

3463
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:45,000
Knights of the Clicky haven't touched in 2 and a half, 3 months

3464
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:47,000
I deleted it

3465
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:49,000
I've deleted almost all of my games

3466
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:51,000
I want to play the Civ game

3467
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:53,000
That was the only thing I was interested in

3468
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:55,000
Does that come out? I don't even remember

3469
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:57,000
And then there's some

3470
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:59,000
Supposedly, and it's a story that didn't make our show roll tonight

3471
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:01,000
But some music game is out on Facebook too

3472
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:03,000
That I need to check out for next week

3473
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:05,000
Something that was posted in our thread

3474
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:07,000
About like a Facebook game, but I wanted to actually play it

3475
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:09,000
Before bringing it up on the show

3476
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:11,000
But apparently there's that too

3477
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:13,000
So, alright

3478
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:15,000
Cassandra in our chat room says

3479
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:17,000
Scrabulous sounds like a Decepticon name

3480
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:19,000
I like that

3481
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:21,000
Alright, let's move on

3482
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,000
DarkSakura, what do you got for us?

3483
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:25,000
Well, there is

3484
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:27,000
An Activision memo that was linked

3485
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:29,000
That says there is no

3486
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:31,000
Appetite for Guitar Hero

3487
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:33,000
Aww

3488
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:35,000
It actually was saying is that

3489
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:37,000
But there is an appetite for destruction

3490
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:39,000
And there's also an

3491
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:41,000
Aperitif for destruction

3492
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:43,000
If you like, lounge against the machine

3493
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:45,000
Anyway

3494
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:47,000
Basically

3495
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:49,000
The whole thing that they're saying is that

3496
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:51,000
Yeah, right now it's dead

3497
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:53,000
But it should

3498
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:55,000
Eventually come back up

3499
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:57,000
They're asking

3500
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:59,000
The CEO Eric

3501
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:01,000
Hirschberg said

3502
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:03,000
Why are we walking away from Guitar Hero

3503
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:05,000
Instead of just trying to reinvent it

3504
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,000
And that basically it's because

3505
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:09,000
There are so many

3506
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:11,000
High quality games that are just

3507
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:13,000
Saturating the market

3508
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:15,000
Wasn't this what we were saying before?

3509
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:17,000
Is that the market was just way too saturated?

3510
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:19,000
Well, they're like, oh, duh

3511
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:21,000
That's what we were doing wrong

3512
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:23,000
So

3513
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:25,000
They're sort of

3514
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:27,000
Setting it aside for now

3515
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:29,000
In fact, it actually says that they are

3516
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:31,000
Perhaps after a cooling period

3517
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:33,000
We will revisit the franchise with fresh innovation

3518
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:35,000
They're gonna wait for people to go

3519
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:37,000
Remember when Guitar Hero was cool

3520
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:39,000
And then Activision will be right there

3521
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:41,000
To say, hey, we still own the rights to this

3522
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:43,000
Hey, there's a whole new Guitar Hero game for you to play

3523
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:45,000
Haha

3524
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:47,000
It's retro Guitar Hero

3525
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:49,000
Meanwhile, Rock Band's like, we've been out here and we're still cool

3526
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:51,000
Hi, we're still cool

3527
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:53,000
Hi, we're really cool

3528
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:55,000
We've attached

3529
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:57,000
The clarinet attachment

3530
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:59,000
Although I do, I even feel like the Rock Band

3531
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:01,000
Thing has really died down

3532
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:03,000
It's really died down

3533
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:05,000
It's kinda sad

3534
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:07,000
We were just playing the other day

3535
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:09,000
The cousins were over when we were playing

3536
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:11,000
SSJ100 Matt in our chat room says

3537
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:13,000
Notice how no one ever asked these questions when

3538
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:15,000
DDR died, in Konami that is

3539
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:17,000
Well, technically DDR is

3540
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:19,000
Still not dead

3541
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:21,000
I mean, they are still cranking out those games

3542
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:23,000
Like, wow, there's an Xbox 360

3543
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:25,000
One coming out, the port of the

3544
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:27,000
PlayStation 3 one is coming on the Xbox

3545
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:29,000
360 and you guys, it uses the

3546
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:31,000
Xbox Live Vision camera

3547
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:33,000
That's how hip Konami is

3548
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:35,000
The little webcam

3549
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:37,000
Not the Kinect, but the little

3550
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:39,000
AOL-looking thing

3551
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:41,000
We'll use that, apparently

3552
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:43,000
I hope to God for Konami's

3553
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:45,000
Sake, the Kinect will stand in

3554
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:47,000
For that, because the Kinect's

3555
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:49,000
Basically a camera too, but

3556
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:51,000
I think the 360 only has the

3557
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:53,000
One I.O. USB port in the back

3558
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:55,000
For goodies, so you'd have to

3559
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:57,000
Unplug your Kinect to plug in the little webcam

3560
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:59,000
That's not gonna happen

3561
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:01,000
And if seriously

3562
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:03,000
It only works with that little camera

3563
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:05,000
And it doesn't work with Kinect, then everyone point and laugh

3564
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:07,000
At Konami

3565
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:09,000
Anyhow

3566
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:11,000
Oh yeah, Guitar Hero, yeah

3567
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:13,000
Well, someday it'll come out

3568
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:15,000
It's being cryogenically frozen for a later date

3569
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:17,000
So that they can bust it out in the future

3570
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:19,000
To save humanity

3571
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:21,000
It's next to Walt Disney's head

3572
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:23,000
Alright

3573
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:25,000
Moving on, so let's just pop

3574
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:27,000
There was a story that we reported

3575
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:29,000
On a few weeks ago about

3576
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:31,000
Ratings tampering on the

3577
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:33,000
Indie marketplace on the

3578
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:35,000
XBLA

3579
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:37,000
And some indie games

3580
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:39,000
That had anywhere from three to five star reviews

3581
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:41,000
Were getting hundreds

3582
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:43,000
Of one star reviews

3583
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:45,000
Within a short amount of time that was throwing

3584
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:47,000
Their game listing

3585
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:49,000
And their rankings down

3586
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:51,000
Into the toilet so they weren't getting as much

3587
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:53,000
Exposure as they would otherwise

3588
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:55,000
If they had their four star review

3589
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:57,000
So, Microsoft decided

3590
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:59,000
To come up with a fix to this

3591
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:01,000
And they have decided that

3592
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:03,000
In order to

3593
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:05,000
Rate an indie game, you need to

3594
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:07,000
Have a gold account, which means you are

3595
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:09,000
Paying Microsoft

3596
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:11,000
For the Xbox Gold

3597
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:13,000
Live services, if you are a free or

3598
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:15,000
Silver member, you cannot give

3599
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:17,000
A rating to a game

3600
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:19,000
An indie game

3601
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:21,000
That's good, because it was probably a bunch of

3602
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:23,000
Sock-free accounts that were doing this anyway

3603
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:25,000
This story that I looked up

3604
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:27,000
Also references a previous story

3605
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:29,000
When the manipulation was first discovered

3606
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:31,000
About a

3607
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:33,000
Firm that had posted

3608
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:35,000
To a contractor

3609
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:37,000
Job site

3610
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:39,000
Basically saying, we need someone

3611
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:41,000
That can write a script that will generate

3612
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:43,000
5,000 free silver

3613
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:45,000
Accounts

3614
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:47,000
They were looking for a coder that's like, can we run this

3615
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:49,000
Overnight and just get the username spit out to us

3616
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:51,000
Doesn't necessarily say

3617
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:53,000
Why they wanted those 5,000

3618
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:55,000
Accounts or if it's even related to

3619
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:57,000
This

3620
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:59,000
Rating manipulation, but just as a coincidence

3621
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:01,000
There are firms out there that are like

3622
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:03,000
We want

3623
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:05,000
Wow, if I was Microsoft

3624
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:07,000
I would be bringing the smackdown

3625
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:09,000
On these firms for abusing their network

3626
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:11,000
Yeah, I guess it was a

3627
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:13,000
Graphic design firm contract

3628
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:15,000
Script for 5,000 Xbox Live

3629
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:17,000
Silver accounts

3630
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:19,000
Again, don't know for sure, but the fact that

3631
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:21,000
The interest for that is there

3632
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:23,000
Microsoft's like, if you have a free account

3633
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:25,000
You don't get to rate on indie games

3634
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:27,000
Which, I guess, makes sense

3635
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:29,000
That sucks that you have to pay, but it will

3636
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:31,000
If you have a

3637
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:33,000
Gold account, they can take action

3638
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:35,000
Against you, they can ban your credit

3639
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:37,000
Card, they can ban your account

3640
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:39,000
You lose your gamer tag, you lose your achievement points

3641
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:41,000
Why didn't they just

3642
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:43,000
Make it so you have to actually play the game for 10 minutes

3643
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:45,000
To rate? I mean, is that

3644
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:47,000
So hard? I don't know

3645
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:49,000
I guess that's hard to do

3646
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:51,000
It's easy to build something to shut it off after 4 minutes

3647
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:53,000
Oh, demo over 4 minutes, clank, buy

3648
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:55,000
Or get out

3649
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:57,000
Can you buy indie games a la carte with a silver or do you need gold

3650
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:59,000
In order to even buy stuff on there

3651
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:01,000
You can buy a la carte with silver

3652
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:03,000
Yeah, I don't see why they would shove

3653
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:05,000
It's money, why would you shut off a money maker?

3654
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:07,000
I'm pretty sure

3655
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:09,000
So, uh, and Randy

3656
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:11,000
In our chatroom at chat.orangetonsrated.com

3657
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:13,000
Agrees with me, they should make it so that you have to

3658
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:15,000
Actually play a game for a set amount of time to rate it

3659
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:17,000
That way people have to go out of their way to be jerks

3660
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:19,000
At the same time, though, what's

3661
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:21,000
To stop somebody from building a script that signs

3662
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:23,000
In 5000 Xbox Live users into

3663
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:25,000
A game? I mean, it's possible

3664
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:27,000
A botting thing could do it

3665
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:29,000
Sad but true, somebody would figure it out

3666
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:31,000
Yeah, I

3667
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:33,000
I agree that you should

3668
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:35,000
Be able to

3669
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:37,000
Have to play the game before you can rate it

3670
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:39,000
But at the same time

3671
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:41,000
If I play a demo that is so

3672
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:43,000
Bad

3673
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:45,000
And I want to be able to warn people

3674
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:47,000
That this demo was horrible

3675
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:49,000
Like that maze with balloons?

3676
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:51,000
Yeah, I'm not gonna

3677
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:53,000
Pay the 300 space bucks

3678
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:55,000
I think people should

3679
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:57,000
Download maze with balloons

3680
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:59,000
Just to see how freaking bad it is

3681
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:01,000
It is like an old, you know what

3682
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:03,000
Maze with balloons reminds me of?

3683
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:05,000
An old CD-ROM game from when that technology

3684
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:07,000
First came out and people were like

3685
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:09,000
Let's put softcore porn out

3686
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:11,000
And try to make a game out of it

3687
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:13,000
I'm thinking of the slumber party game

3688
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:15,000
That that one girl was in from the

3689
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:17,000
Night Trap

3690
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:19,000
Yeah, it's like that

3691
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:21,000
Exactly

3692
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:23,000
Alright, anyhow

3693
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:25,000
Let's move on to one other story

3694
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:27,000
And I've kind of brought this up before

3695
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:29,000
So this is a bit of a duh

3696
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:31,000
But Super Mario 3DS, of course it is going to be

3697
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:33,000
Announced at E3

3698
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:35,000
Well, I mean, I guess it was announced

3699
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:37,000
Quote-unquote at Game Developers Conference

3700
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:39,000
But we're gonna get the official details

3701
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:41,000
I guess you could say at E3

3702
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:43,000
Apparently, though, according to an interview with

3703
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:45,000
Edge, Miyamoto has leaked out a few details

3704
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:47,000
On this

3705
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:49,000
It's gonna have a combination of Super Mario Galaxy

3706
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:51,000
And Super Mario 64

3707
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:53,000
Two games that's still completely original

3708
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:55,000
Perhaps that's because of the tanooki

3709
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:57,000
Or the raccoon suit, which we haven't seen in any

3710
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:59,000
Of those other games

3711
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:01,000
That could be part of it as well

3712
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:03,000
Or maybe it'll just be kind of a mechanic about the story

3713
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:05,000
Of the game or how it all kind of plays together

3714
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:07,000
Maybe instead of, I would like to see this

3715
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:09,000
In a Mario game, maybe I'm just, maybe a pipe dream

3716
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:11,000
But a bump

3717
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:13,000
But instead of all these broken up worlds

3718
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:15,000
What about one massive world?

3719
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:17,000
I'd like to see a Mario game like that

3720
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:19,000
Yeah, like a sandbox Mario game

3721
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:21,000
That'd be awesome, actually

3722
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:23,000
Imagine if the warp zones actually took you

3723
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:25,000
Places to other parts of this one giant world

3724
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:27,000
Instead of a heavily fragmented

3725
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:29,000
You know, now you're on Bee Planet

3726
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:31,000
Now you're on Candy Planet

3727
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:33,000
I think that there should be, you know, things you have to do

3728
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:35,000
To unlock different areas

3729
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:37,000
Sure, just like any good Metroidvania

3730
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:39,000
Type of game

3731
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:41,000
You have to get an item to get behind the door

3732
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:43,000
I would like to see that in a Mario game

3733
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:45,000
That would be pretty awesome

3734
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:47,000
That would be very awesome, we'll see what happens

3735
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:49,000
Let's see, Redertainment in our chatroom

3736
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:51,000
I want to read this comment too, speaking of the whole demos

3737
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:53,000
And down ranking, chat.orangetownsradio.com

3738
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:55,000
Is of course where our chatroom is

3739
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:57,000
Redertainment says, if you want to warn people that a demo

3740
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:59,000
Sucks, I'm sure you have a Twitter account

3741
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:01,000
You can bitch on that reaches more people

3742
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:03,000
Than that downloaded that indie title

3743
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:07,000
And Randy says that Grand Theft Mario reminds him

3744
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:09,000
Of something that happened in Robot Chicken

3745
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:11,000
I haven't seen

3746
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:13,000
Every episode of Robot Chicken, so I guess that went over my head

3747
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:15,000
Oops, I did see

3748
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:17,000
The Final Fantasy VII fast food

3749
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:19,000
That was great

3750
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:21,000
Alright, let's get to the emails

3751
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:23,000
Every week you guys send us emails

3752
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:25,000
At mailbag.orangetownsradio.com

3753
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:27,000
The mailbag has been rather thin the past few weeks

3754
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:29,000
So I'm really happy that this week you guys

3755
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:31,000
Have fucking blown it up

3756
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:33,000
Dark Soccer is going to work tonight

3757
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:35,000
Well, we got a request

3758
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:37,000
From

3759
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:39,000
Ronnie

3760
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:41,000
For an autograph

3761
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:43,000
With an address, this is a five year listener

3762
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:45,000
So I figured I was going to find

3763
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:47,000
A postcard that I have

3764
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:49,000
And we could just sign it and then put it in an envelope and send it

3765
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:51,000
So I have one that says Juicyful

3766
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:53,000
And it's orange

3767
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:55,000
Either that or I was going to use the congratulations on your Bar Mitzvah

3768
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:57,000
Card

3769
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:59,000
That I got at the dollar store

3770
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:01,000
For any upcoming Bar Mitzvah

3771
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:03,000
Because there's a lot of kids

3772
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:05,000
And I was like, no I better save that for an actual

3773
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:07,000
Bar Mitzvah

3774
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:09,000
So yeah, I set this aside

3775
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:11,000
And we'll get everyone to sign it

3776
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:13,000
So I mean, SalaciousPop I'm sure

3777
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:15,000
Would not, his autograph would not

3778
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:17,000
Go unappreciated, but I'm sure somebody wants

3779
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:19,000
A complete trifecta of official OLR hosts

3780
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:21,000
Yeah, so

3781
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:23,000
I just need to make sure that

3782
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:25,000
I mark the right one

3783
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:27,000
Yeah, don't click delete

3784
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:29,000
I'm not deleting it

3785
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:31,000
There, it's this one, so I will

3786
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:33,000
Do unread, there we go

3787
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:35,000
And moving forward

3788
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:37,000
This is from

3789
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:39,000
Holly D. Hey guys

3790
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:41,000
I swear your email was the above

3791
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:43,000
But I recently heard you say mailbag at OrangeLaundryRadio.com

3792
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:45,000
Is the Gmail

3793
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:47,000
One an old email or something?

3794
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:49,000
I don't know, do we have a Gmail?

3795
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:51,000
Do we have a Gmail? If we do

3796
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:53,000
What's the

3797
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:55,000
Sender's name? Holly

3798
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:57,000
Is that the Holly that writes it to Hordhouse?

3799
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:59,000
Oh, it's probably the same Holly from Hordhouse

3800
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:01,000
That is a Gmail account

3801
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:03,000
Yeah, that is a Gmail account

3802
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:05,000
The email for Hordhouse is

3803
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:07,000
HordhousePodcast at Gmail.com

3804
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:09,000
OrangeLaundryRadio is mailbag at OrangeLaundryRadio.com

3805
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:11,000
I want to see if

3806
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:13,000
Maybe somebody's swiped it

3807
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:15,000
I don't know, let me look

3808
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:17,000
So anywho, just wanted to confirm because I sent a couple of emails

3809
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:19,000
And I thought it was weird that Sucker kept saying you only had one or two emails

3810
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:21,000
Maybe other people are confused like me

3811
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:23,000
Thanks

3812
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:25,000
Yeah, it's

3813
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:27,000
You sent it to the right one now

3814
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:29,000
So it's mailbag at OrangeLaundryRadio.com

3815
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:31,000
Okay, hey

3816
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:33,000
OLR crew

3817
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:35,000
AZHP here

3818
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:37,000
So if anyone at OLR has played the PS2 game

3819
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:39,000
Shin Megami Tensei Persona 4

3820
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:41,000
But I wanted to share

3821
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:43,000
The gaming related project that I've decided to take upon myself

3822
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:45,000
Persona 4 takes place in the year 2011

3823
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:47,000
From April 11th through the rest of the year

3824
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:49,000
That being the case, I've taken it upon myself

3825
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:51,000
To tweet the events of Persona 4

3826
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:53,000
Roughly as they happen

3827
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:55,000
It's just a very deep game with lots of relationships

3828
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:57,000
Drama, mystery

3829
02:08:57,000 --> 02:08:59,000
And just lots of things to do in general

3830
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:01,000
And I'll try to make it as interesting and funny

3831
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:03,000
To follow along with as possible

3832
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:05,000
The Twitter account is

3833
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:07,000
NarukamiU

3834
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:11,000
That's N-A-R-U-K-M-I-Y-U

3835
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:13,000
NarukamiU being the name of

3836
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:15,000
Being, let me start over

3837
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:17,000
NarukamiU being the name

3838
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:19,000
That the people developing the new Persona 4

3839
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:21,000
Anime have given the originally nameless

3840
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:23,000
Main character

3841
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:25,000
I'm not looking to become some sort of D-list-y

3842
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:27,000
Celebrity by doing this

3843
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:29,000
But I do want people who would be appreciated

3844
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:31,000
In this sort of project to know about it

3845
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:33,000
If you spread the word on your show

3846
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:35,000
I would be deeply honored

3847
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:37,000
Again the Twitter account is at NarukamiU

3848
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:39,000
Also happy birthday DarkSarka, thank you

3849
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:41,000
Your birthday is just a few days before mine

3850
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:43,000
And mine is the day before Wendell's

3851
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:45,000
So yours was yesterday, well happy birthday

3852
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:47,000
Keep up the great work

3853
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:49,000
And thanks so much for helping me spread the word

3854
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:51,000
AZHP, and also a very big happy birthday

3855
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:53,000
To Mr. Wendell, thank you for reminding me to say so

3856
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:55,000
Cause Wendell is one of our old school buddies

3857
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:57,000
Happy birthday all y'all

3858
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:59,000
And glad you got that plug worked out

3859
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:01,000
He's old

3860
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:03,000
I just wanted to follow up

3861
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:05,000
It does look like there is an Orange Lounge Radio

3862
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:07,000
Email account at Gmail

3863
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:09,000
It is not us

3864
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:11,000
I sent a password reset thing

3865
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:13,000
So if it is one of us we'll get the email

3866
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:15,000
But it's not in my email, it's not in my Orange Lounge Radio

3867
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:17,000
It's not in the mailbag email

3868
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:19,000
Somebody else could have signed up trying to impersonate us

3869
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:21,000
I certainly suppose that's possible

3870
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:23,000
Loki could have it too

3871
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:27,000
He might have done that for the YouTube channel or something

3872
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:29,000
But that's very possible

3873
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:31,000
So one of us will have the reset email if it's ours

3874
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:33,000
But as far as we know right now, we don't own it

3875
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:35,000
I've got about six different emails and none of them are

3876
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:37,000
And we don't write from that address

3877
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:39,000
So if you do get something from OrangeLoungeRadio.com

3878
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:43,000
Forward it to the official email of Orange Lounge Radio

3879
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:45,000
Which is mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

3880
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:47,000
So we can investigate

3881
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:49,000
And other than that, we're probably going to have to send a notice

3882
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:51,000
For them to strike it

3883
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:53,000
It could be Loki

3884
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:55,000
Loki could have done with the YouTube channel

3885
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:57,000
So we'll have to ask him next week

3886
02:10:57,000 --> 02:10:59,000
Thanks for letting us know

3887
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:01,000
Greetings, O.L.R. This week was torture without your podcast

3888
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:03,000
Don't ever take another week off again

3889
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:05,000
Even if Rob and Jamie have to go somewhere

3890
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:07,000
I'll suck it up and just listen to Loki eat chicken

3891
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:09,000
And complain about Nintendo for three hours

3892
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:11,000
Which is exactly what it would be

3893
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:13,000
Peace and chicken grease serious turtle

3894
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:15,000
He's a very serious turtle

3895
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:17,000
Seriously, you're not allowed to leave

3896
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:19,000
Long email is long

3897
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:21,000
I just want to point out

3898
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:23,000
A lot of your favorite shows take all summer off

3899
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:27,000
We take one week off every three months or so

3900
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:29,000
I think it's okay if we miss four shows a year

3901
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:31,000
We need a vacation sometimes

3902
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:33,000
That's right

3903
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:35,000
It felt really good to not have a show last week

3904
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:37,000
I love doing the show

3905
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:39,000
Don't get me wrong, but it was kind of nice to have Sunday night

3906
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:41,000
To do something else

3907
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:43,000
Usually when I take Sunday off

3908
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:45,000
If it's not for family stuff

3909
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:47,000
It's for doing something else for the show

3910
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:49,000
I've gone to gaming conventions

3911
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:51,000
And stuff called in and reported on it

3912
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:53,000
And sometimes, honestly, I wish I was here instead of there

3913
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:55,000
But, you know

3914
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:57,000
Because this is my house

3915
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:59,000
Okay

3916
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:01,000
Hi, OLR, this is from Spazznator, by the way

3917
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:03,000
I'm pretty sure that the three of you have covered the story

3918
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:05,000
About PSN going down this week due to hackers

3919
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:07,000
In part A of this week's show

3920
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:09,000
So I won't bother rehashing the details

3921
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:11,000
Rather, I'd like to do a Loki-style rant about it, if I may

3922
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:13,000
While I'm not pissed at Sony

3923
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:15,000
Hell, from what I can tell

3924
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:17,000
They did what they needed to do

3925
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:19,000
I am, however, extremely pissed off

3926
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:21,000
Okay, dude, it's not hackers, okay

3927
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:23,000
But I will read your rant, anyway

3928
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:25,000
I am, however, EXTREMELY

3929
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:27,000
PISSED OFF

3930
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:29,000
At these fucktards that hacked PSN

3931
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:31,000
Despite Sony not explicitly saying

3932
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:33,000
Who it was that did it

3933
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:35,000
I'm 100,000% sure

3934
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:37,000
It was these anonymous dickwads that did it

3935
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:39,000
After all, as the old saying goes

3936
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:41,000
If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck

3937
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:43,000
It must be a duck

3938
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:45,000
Who the holy hell are they to do this

3939
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:47,000
What the fuck gives them the right?

3940
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:49,000
They're a small minority

3941
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:51,000
Have other consoles to play online with

3942
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:53,000
Yes, there are single player games as well

3943
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:55,000
But that's besides the point

3944
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:57,000
There are games such as

3945
02:12:57,000 --> 02:12:59,000
Mags, SOCOM, Confrontation Free Realms, DCUO, etc

3946
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:01,000
That are multiplayer only

3947
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:03,000
As well as a few Capcom titles

3948
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:05,000
I.e. Final Fight Double Impact

3949
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:07,000
And Bionic Commando Rearm 2

3950
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:09,000
That require one to be logged into PSN to play

3951
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:11,000
Hence, right now, they're unplayable

3952
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:13,000
Many of those titles I play on a regular basis

3953
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:15,000
And tend to love

3954
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:17,000
Just over the fact that, for the time being

3955
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:19,000
I can't access the PSN video store

3956
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:21,000
To get either the freebies

3957
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:23,000
And or paid content

3958
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:25,000
And the three of you know how much I love that store

3959
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:27,000
Hell, as is, I will never shut up about it

3960
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:29,000
At any rate

3961
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:31,000
When Sony finds these torps

3962
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:33,000
And they will, it's just a matter of time

3963
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:35,000
I hope they get the legal system on their punk asses

3964
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:37,000
Like white on motherfucking rice

3965
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:39,000
And, as Samuel Jackson so eloquently put it

3966
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:41,000
Gets Medivial on their asses

3967
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:43,000
May the hackers burn in a nuclear fire

3968
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:45,000
Than drown an ocean of piss and acid

3969
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:47,000
Slash end rants

3970
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:49,000
It actually did exhales

3971
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:51,000
But I exhaled

3972
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:53,000
This rant is brought to you by one really pissed off PSN user

3973
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:55,000
That wants to lay the smack down on some punks

3974
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:57,000
By the way, your anger may be a little misdirected

3975
02:13:57,000 --> 02:13:59,000
Wait until it's resolved

3976
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:01,000
An official word comes out

3977
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:03,000
I kind of agree

3978
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:05,000
With what you're saying, can I read this real quick from Bobby

3979
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:07,000
In our chatroom too? DarkSakura

3980
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:09,000
Yeah, I kept telling him it wasn't anonymous and he told me I was wrong

3981
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:11,000
He told me it didn't matter what the truth was

3982
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:13,000
I was going to blame Anon

3983
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:15,000
See, Anon was very proud

3984
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:17,000
To take credit for that first Sony attack

3985
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:19,000
And that's the problem

3986
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:21,000
Is that now that this is happening, I mean

3987
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:23,000
This could be happening from somebody who's trying to get at Anonymous

3988
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:25,000
For all we know

3989
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:27,000
But Anonymous flat out said

3990
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:29,000
We understand that this tactic

3991
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:31,000
Only hurts the people we're trying to protect

3992
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:33,000
We are not going to do it anymore

3993
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:35,000
But

3994
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:37,000
But because Anonymous has no leader

3995
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:39,000
You know, it's not like

3996
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:41,000
WikiLeaks who has that, whatever his name is

3997
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:43,000
They've got a group that's

3998
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:45,000
But there's no clear leader out there

3999
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:47,000
And that's what's causing them

4000
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:49,000
To look bad is because it could be

4001
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:51,000
A subset that's doing it

4002
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:53,000
Regardless

4003
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:55,000
I don't think this is Anonymous

4004
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:57,000
I think they may benefit from the notoriety

4005
02:14:57,000 --> 02:14:59,000
But

4006
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:01,000
I don't think this is Anonymous

4007
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:03,000
They flat out said

4008
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:05,000
No, this is counter productive

4009
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:07,000
To what we're trying to do

4010
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:09,000
So don't

4011
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:11,000
Don't look for a scapegoat, wait until they actually

4012
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:13,000
Officially say what's going on, because I have a feeling

4013
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:15,000
That it's actually one of those situations

4014
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:17,000
Where, like, okay, at my work

4015
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:19,000
We got an email out that said

4016
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:21,000
This number of

4017
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:23,000
People are affected

4018
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:25,000
Because a laptop was stolen

4019
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:27,000
Who hacked

4020
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:29,000
The

4021
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:31,000
Site that does all the

4022
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:33,000
Email campaigns?

4023
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:35,000
That happened about, what, two, three weeks ago

4024
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:37,000
Do you remember the salacious pop? You read a lot of internet news

4025
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:39,000
Somebody hacked, it wasn't Anonymous

4026
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:41,000
It was somebody else hacked some

4027
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:43,000
Spam, no, not spam, I'm sorry

4028
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:45,000
They do, like, the email campaigns for all these various

4029
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:47,000
Websites, and all

4030
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:49,000
These websites that use this email

4031
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:51,000
Service to maintain their mailing list and so forth had to

4032
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:53,000
Write people, because I got some from a couple

4033
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:55,000
Companies saying

4034
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:57,000
Your personal information may have been breached

4035
02:15:57,000 --> 02:15:59,000
Your email and so forth, because we

4036
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:01,000
Got hacked. Oh, are you talking about

4037
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:03,000
The Gawker network, Kotaku?

4038
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:05,000
No, but there's that too

4039
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:07,000
So that wasn't Anonymous either

4040
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:09,000
That wasn't Anonymous either. Somebody's out there

4041
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:11,000
Hacking for personal information

4042
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:13,000
Because maybe somebody in chat will, I'll ring a bell

4043
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:15,000
Somebody hacked Gawker

4044
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:17,000
Somebody hacked this email network to get

4045
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:19,000
All the emails and so forth

4046
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:21,000
I think it's them

4047
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:23,000
That's getting Sony. I think somebody went after

4048
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:25,000
That private information, it's Sony

4049
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:27,000
So, yeah, and this is

4050
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:29,000
What I have to say to you, is that

4051
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:31,000
When

4052
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:33,000
When you have a situation like this

4053
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:35,000
Where, yeah, you may have an easy person

4054
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:37,000
To place blame on

4055
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:39,000
Keep in mind that

4056
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:41,000
Wars have been started

4057
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:43,000
Over people putting the blame where there was

4058
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:45,000
On an innocent party, just because

4059
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:47,000
Of quote, circumstantial evidence

4060
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:49,000
Don't be one of those people

4061
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:51,000
Don't be a dick like that

4062
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:53,000
And also, with the DDS

4063
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:55,000
DDoS attack

4064
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:57,000
You know, you've got hundreds or thousands of computers

4065
02:16:57,000 --> 02:16:59,000
That have been compromised in some way

4066
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:01,000
You're flooding the network with garbage

4067
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:03,000
It's very hard, because you've got all of these compromised

4068
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:05,000
Computers of just regular

4069
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:07,000
PC owners

4070
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:09,000
It's hard to

4071
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:11,000
As obnoxious as it is

4072
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:13,000
It's very difficult

4073
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:15,000
It's not an actionable crime, is what I'm trying to say

4074
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:17,000
Because the computers are compromised

4075
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:19,000
If you're hacking into something

4076
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:21,000
And you're getting customer information

4077
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:23,000
Which hasn't been confirmed yet

4078
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:25,000
That's like a federal, that's serious

4079
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:27,000
And that's not their MO

4080
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:29,000
That's totally not their MO

4081
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:31,000
Keep in mind, all of the stuff that they've

4082
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:33,000
Been doing is basically forms

4083
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:35,000
Of vigilantism

4084
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:37,000
They have gone after people who

4085
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:39,000
They have perceived have committed

4086
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:41,000
Some sort of crime that's

4087
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:43,000
Not being punished in the proper way

4088
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:45,000
And they are going after these people to make their lives

4089
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:47,000
Miserable

4090
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:49,000
Yeah, they'll waste some of your time and some of your money

4091
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:51,000
And then that's it, they'll get their plan across

4092
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:53,000
But when they've gone after people's information

4093
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:55,000
It's been specific people

4094
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:57,000
To have a specific thing happen

4095
02:17:57,000 --> 02:17:59,000
I've got to read some of these comments in chat, they're piling up here

4096
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:01,000
In the true Easter spirit

4097
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:03,000
Redertainment says, the Jews did it

4098
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:05,000
Happy Easter

4099
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:07,000
Fuck that

4100
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:09,000
And fuck you

4101
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:11,000
DefectiveCandy in our chatroom says

4102
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:13,000
The Epsilon email hacking was supposedly

4103
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:15,000
Accomplished by one rogue individual

4104
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:17,000
Thank you, it's Epsilon

4105
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:19,000
Could be a former employee

4106
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:21,000
That's true

4107
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:23,000
SSJ100Matt says

4108
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:25,000
Blaming everything on 4chan

4109
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:27,000
I thought that was anonymous

4110
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:29,000
That's the home of anonymous

4111
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:31,000
So there you go

4112
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:33,000
I like what Cogito said

4113
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:35,000
I don't think Sony was a hack at all

4114
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:37,000
Someone lost the keys to the big Sony computer and they can't all get in

4115
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:39,000
Check the crayon boxes

4116
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:41,000
Get that leash out

4117
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:43,000
There's like a cat that unplugged the thing

4118
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:45,000
Meow

4119
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:47,000
I'm in your Sony hack in your store

4120
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:49,000
But seriously

4121
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:51,000
Look at everything

4122
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:53,000
Don't pick one convenient scapegoat

4123
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:55,000
That's just

4124
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:57,000
That's not very smart

4125
02:18:57,000 --> 02:18:59,000
Next email

4126
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:01,000
Yay, happy sunshine

4127
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:03,000
Unicorns that shit rainbows that kill people

4128
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:05,000
Yay

4129
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:07,000
Dear peoples

4130
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:09,000
We're peoples

4131
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:11,000
Oh, it's Redertainment

4132
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:13,000
Like you, I've been following the recent PSN outages

4133
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:15,000
Since I started popping up on Wednesday night

4134
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:17,000
When I first discovered these outages

4135
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:19,000
I was frustrated

4136
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:21,000
Raged out and cursed to the love my neighbors thought I was killing someone

4137
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:23,000
Not kidding

4138
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:25,000
Anyway, in the process of following the story

4139
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:27,000
I found the story that I'm sure you covered

4140
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:29,000
Earlier on the show

4141
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:31,000
Uh

4142
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:33,000
Let me see what this is

4143
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:35,000
I think that's just

4144
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:37,000
Yeah, it's the same story we covered basically

4145
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:39,000
From another source

4146
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:41,000
Once I read the story, I became considerably less angry

4147
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:43,000
As I can understand that Sony taking actions like this

4148
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:45,000
In response to this threat to a point

4149
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:47,000
However, there is one part of the story that really concerns me

4150
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:49,000
This is

4151
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:51,000
In order to

4152
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:53,000
Verify the smooth and secure operation

4153
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:55,000
Of the services Sony pulled the plug

4154
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:57,000
On both services April 20th

4155
02:19:57,000 --> 02:19:59,000
This sentence gives me an impression that this isn't

4156
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:01,000
A simple hacking job

4157
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:03,000
Given Sony's recent movements in relation to piracy

4158
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:05,000
I believe that this may be the nature of Sony

4159
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:07,000
Taking down PSN

4160
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:09,000
I believe someone figured out how to pirate games

4161
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:11,000
Distributed digitally

4162
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:13,000
Oh, this is a good idea

4163
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:15,000
Distributed digitally via PSN

4164
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:17,000
If any of these conclusions are wrong

4165
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:19,000
Also, why do I have to go through PSN

4166
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:21,000
Or live to access Hulu Plus or Netflix

4167
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:23,000
I mean, when I want to watch Hulu

4168
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:25,000
On my laptop, all I have to do is fire up my browser

4169
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:27,000
Go through my ISP

4170
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:29,000
To get to what I want to watch

4171
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:31,000
I don't have to go through my laptop's manufacturer

4172
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:33,000
Exclusive network to access things

4173
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:35,000
So I don't have to do it on home consoles

4174
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:37,000
Because they're evil

4175
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:39,000
Stay black, redertainment

4176
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:41,000
This message has been brought to you by the successor to Anonymous

4177
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:43,000
Who was actually responsible for PSN

4178
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:45,000
I wrote it down and it's totally unknown to the public

4179
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:47,000
Nyanya

4180
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:49,000
Sent from my iPad

4181
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:51,000
Actually, we do have a theory in the chat room

4182
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:53,000
On who might be to blame

4183
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:55,000
For all of this that's going on on the PlayStation network

4184
02:20:55,000 --> 02:20:57,000
An interesting theory

4185
02:20:57,000 --> 02:20:59,000
We need to know

4186
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:01,000
Play Canada

4187
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:03,000
Play Canada

4188
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:05,000
All their beady little eyes

4189
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:07,000
Clap their heads and roll their lives

4190
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:09,000
Play Canada

4191
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:11,000
Play Canada

4192
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:13,000
We need to form a full assault

4193
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:15,000
Yep, it's all Canada's fault

4194
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:17,000
Actually, we should blame SkyNet

4195
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:19,000
We did survive Judgment Day

4196
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:21,000
We did

4197
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:23,000
In response to that email about why you have to authenticate

4198
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:25,000
With the console before you can use Netflix and Hulu

4199
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:27,000
For Netflix and Hulu

4200
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:29,000
To allow a third party appliance

4201
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:31,000
To run their service

4202
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:33,000
There needs to be some sort of accountability

4203
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:35,000
So that someone doesn't get an $8 Netflix account

4204
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:37,000
Give their username and password to their 40 friends

4205
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:39,000
That have a PlayStation 3

4206
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:41,000
And have them all

4207
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:43,000
Running Netflix off the one account

4208
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:45,000
So I think

4209
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:47,000
By authenticating into PSN

4210
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:49,000
It's saying

4211
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:51,000
This PSN account with this

4212
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:53,000
PlayStation 3 ID is using this Netflix

4213
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:55,000
And there's a sync there

4214
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:57,000
And that's why they do it

4215
02:21:57,000 --> 02:21:59,000
However, it does not stop people from sharing Netflix accounts over the internet

4216
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:01,000
Black Wolf says that Netflix will still work

4217
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:03,000
You just gotta keep trying to log in

4218
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:05,000
Three to five times, you can get in eventually

4219
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:07,000
I haven't tried on PS3

4220
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:09,000
I've just been

4221
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:11,000
Playing Portal

4222
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:13,000
Offline

4223
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:15,000
Addict

4224
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:17,000
Like it's a bad thing to be addicted to Portal

4225
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:19,000
You can get down with that one

4226
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:21,000
Totally

4227
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:23,000
Okay

4228
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:25,000
Hey OLR, I hope the move went well for you Rob

4229
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:27,000
While you were busy with that, I was busy playing Portal 2

4230
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:31,000
That game has some of the best writing in anything, period

4231
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:33,000
Me too, Salacious Pop, unpack that box

4232
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:35,000
I'm gonna play Portal

4233
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:37,000
Let alone video games

4234
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:39,000
It certainly puts out

4235
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:41,000
What's out there to shame

4236
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:43,000
For some reason I thought of you Rob when I saw this article

4237
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:45,000
Okay, I have to look at this

4238
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:47,000
Uh oh

4239
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:49,000
It's still loading

4240
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:51,000
There's gonna be huge spoilers

4241
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:53,000
And you're gonna freak out

4242
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:55,000
Kagura director thought of Nintendo 3DS

4243
02:22:55,000 --> 02:22:57,000
3D brushed 30 seconds later

4244
02:22:57,000 --> 02:22:59,000
Hey man

4245
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:01,000
There's a guy who did

4246
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:03,000
Half minute hero

4247
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:05,000
I'm telling you

4248
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:07,000
Didn't I talk about that on the show

4249
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:09,000
In the 3DS we were talking about

4250
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:11,000
They just need a game that's boobs, boobs and more boobs

4251
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:13,000
Boobs in 3D, big boobs

4252
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:15,000
Little boobs, black boobs, white boobs

4253
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:17,000
All boobs, big

4254
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:19,000
Boobs with big nips

4255
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:21,000
Boobs with small nips, all types

4256
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:24,000
United Nations of boobs

4257
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:26,000
Coming soon on the 3DS

4258
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:28,000
I don't know if you've ever heard of this before

4259
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:30,000
But for the last few years there's been a convention

4260
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:32,000
Dedicated to the world's favorite hedgehog

4261
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:34,000
Held in London, Summer of Sonic

4262
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:36,000
They usually have early previews

4263
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:38,000
Of coming games and occasionally

4264
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:40,000
Panels slash Q&As with developers

4265
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:42,000
As well as writers for the old UK comic

4266
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:45,000
And I hear this year for the US comics too

4267
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:47,000
This year's is on July 25th if anyone's interested

4268
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:49,000
I would love to go

4269
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:51,000
Somebody get me to Europe

4270
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:53,000
Hear you later, Catastrophic Moggy

4271
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:55,000
P.S. I'm really excited

4272
02:23:55,000 --> 02:23:57,000
About the announcement of the Persona 4 anime

4273
02:23:57,000 --> 02:23:59,000
P.P.S. Hey Jamie, have you seen

4274
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:01,000
The new episode of Doctor Who yet?

4275
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:03,000
Every time someone does the colon P

4276
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:05,000
I do, yes I saw it

4277
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:07,000
And it was amazing

4278
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:09,000
And then I was really pissed off at the end

4279
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:11,000
And then I saw the preview for the next episode

4280
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:13,000
So I wasn't just pissed off

4281
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:15,000
I actually did pause it one time and go

4282
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:17,000
That is bullshit!

4283
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:19,000
And then kept watching

4284
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:21,000
As I understand

4285
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:23,000
I'm not the only person that did that

4286
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:25,000
Do I do that when I watch TV?

4287
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:27,000
Yell back at the TV?

4288
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:29,000
I downloaded it

4289
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:31,000
Sometimes when I watch Survivor

4290
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:33,000
I go, oh no he didn't!

4291
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:35,000
That's about as bad as I get

4292
02:24:35,000 --> 02:24:37,000
You talk during WoW when something bad happens

4293
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:39,000
I do talk during WoW

4294
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:41,000
Thank god Ventrilo

4295
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:43,000
Isn't always on, let's just say that much

4296
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:45,000
Why do you think I don't log into Ventrilo

4297
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:47,000
That often?

4298
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:49,000
Because Dan is usually sitting right where you're sitting Alan

4299
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:51,000
Looking over at me like

4300
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:53,000
You really, really get

4301
02:24:53,000 --> 02:24:55,000
Dirty mouth when you play this game

4302
02:24:55,000 --> 02:24:57,000
I was like, bitches

4303
02:24:57,000 --> 02:24:59,000
So yeah

4304
02:24:59,000 --> 02:25:01,000
And sometimes

4305
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:03,000
Rob will sign into Vent and just be like

4306
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:05,000
Oh, hey what's going on?

4307
02:25:05,000 --> 02:25:07,000
And I'll be sitting right next to him and I'm like, I'm fine

4308
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:09,000
I'm reading, oh no they didn't

4309
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:11,000
He's like, I'm on Vent, duh

4310
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:13,000
I don't know your life

4311
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:15,000
Yeah

4312
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:17,000
Alright, is that it for emails?

4313
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:19,000
That is it

4314
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:21,000
We need more emails for next week

4315
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:23,000
We need to beat the emails we had this week

4316
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:25,000
I want Dark Soccer's email bag to take like an hour next week

4317
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:27,000
Mailbag?

4318
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:29,000
Hey, if this happens, okay if we get

4319
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:31,000
If we break 10 emails

4320
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:33,000
Next week, you have to get me tacos

4321
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:35,000
I'm gonna get you tacos?

4322
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:37,000
Fine

4323
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:39,000
Fine

4324
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:41,000
We get more than 10 emails next week

4325
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:43,000
Not all from the same address

4326
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:45,000
Not all from the same address

4327
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:47,000
Unique, real emails

4328
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:49,000
That are at least a paragraph in length

4329
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:51,000
And with good grammar

4330
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:53,000
3-4 sentences with proper grammar

4331
02:25:53,000 --> 02:25:55,000
Rob will buy me tacos

4332
02:25:55,000 --> 02:25:57,000
Or pink berry

4333
02:25:57,000 --> 02:25:59,000
Taco flavored pink berry

4334
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:01,000
They're gonna be from emails

4335
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:03,000
Like, you know, ShermyCat

4336
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:05,000
Or this is totally not Dan

4337
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:07,000
Hey mom, I pooped in the kitchen again

4338
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:09,000
Love your cat

4339
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:11,000
Number one Dan fan at Gmail

4340
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:13,000
You should have Dan on more often

4341
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:15,000
P.S. Bart

4342
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:17,000
We should get like a taco tote board

4343
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:19,000
And like show how many emails we've got during the week

4344
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:21,000
And then be like, let's see if Jamie's gonna get tacos

4345
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:23,000
Oh, we're at seven emails

4346
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:25,000
So far this week

4347
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:27,000
No taco for Jamie

4348
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:29,000
Can we install that on the website?

4349
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:31,000
The taco meter

4350
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:33,000
The taco meter

4351
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:35,000
Taco Tuesday is an official holiday

4352
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:37,000
Every week

4353
02:26:37,000 --> 02:26:39,000
Black Wolf says, can I write a paragraph about how tasty the tacos would be?

4354
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:43,000
Yes, you can

4355
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:45,000
I will accept emails about tacos

4356
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:47,000
Cause tacos are amazing

4357
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:49,000
Or, you know, you can also do it about taco

4358
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:51,000
Which is octopus

4359
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:53,000
I love takoyaki

4360
02:26:53,000 --> 02:26:55,000
Or you could write a dissertation about the 80s song

4361
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:57,000
Putting on the Ritz by Taco

4362
02:26:57,000 --> 02:26:59,000
No

4363
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:01,000
It has to be video game related

4364
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:03,000
Delicious, crispy taco related

4365
02:27:03,000 --> 02:27:05,000
Or tostadas I take those too

4366
02:27:05,000 --> 02:27:07,000
For fuck's sake, can we move on to another topic?

4367
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:09,000
Taco

4368
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:11,000
Okay

4369
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:13,000
Alright, if you want to send us an email, of course, mailbag at orangelaundry.com

4370
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:15,000
This is the part of the show where we get angsty

4371
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:35,000
It's the FUs of the week segment

4372
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:37,000
Dark Sakura

4373
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:39,000
My FU goes to being really hungry right now

4374
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:41,000
Because over the last whole week I've maybe had

4375
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:43,000
At most

4376
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:45,000
100 calories a day

4377
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:47,000
Because I haven't really been able

4378
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:49,000
To keep anything down

4379
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:51,000
By the way, that candle came from the dollar store

4380
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:53,000
Does it? That smells nice

4381
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:55,000
I'm gonna have to raid the dollar tree

4382
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:57,000
It's a pumpkin bread

4383
02:27:57,000 --> 02:27:59,000
Yeah, I love them, anyway

4384
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:01,000
So, I haven't been able to eat anything

4385
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:03,000
So now today is our annual Easter brunch

4386
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:05,000
And my appetite came back with a vengeance

4387
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:07,000
And now I'm super hungry

4388
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:09,000
Like, I think that's why I'm thinking about tacos

4389
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:11,000
Because I seriously haven't eaten

4390
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:13,000
Since 10 this morning

4391
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:15,000
No, about 10.30 this morning

4392
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:17,000
And then I came home and took a nap

4393
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:19,000
And I'm freaking hungry

4394
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:21,000
I ate matzo when I woke up

4395
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:23,000
And I normally do not like matzo by itself

4396
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:25,000
I ate some

4397
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:27,000
I want food

4398
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:29,000
I want a salad

4399
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:31,000
Actually, what I want is pinkberry, but it probably closed

4400
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:33,000
Yeah, the whole Easter thing

4401
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:35,000
Kind of makes places close

4402
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:37,000
But I heart to you

4403
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:39,000
From my wonderful coffee

4404
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:41,000
Oh, you're welcome

4405
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:43,000
Which is why I have someone from Lertness

4406
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:45,000
Folks don't know, but a lot of times before the show

4407
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:47,000
I do make a Starbucks rhyme

4408
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:49,000
There's Starbucks everywhere

4409
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:51,000
Like, saying there's one not far from Jamie's house

4410
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:53,000
Is like, you know, gee, there's grass in the backyard

4411
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:55,000
But yeah, there's a Starbucks nearby

4412
02:28:55,000 --> 02:28:57,000
I tend to get coffee a lot

4413
02:28:57,000 --> 02:28:59,000
I'm actually

4414
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:01,000
I'm actually going to decaf

4415
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:03,000
If I have it at night, it's gonna be decaf

4416
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:05,000
Yeah, I did request a decaf

4417
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:07,000
I'll remember that in the future

4418
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:09,000
Do you have any FUs for this week?

4419
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:11,000
Just, uh

4420
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:13,000
Not being completely 100% done

4421
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:15,000
With my old place

4422
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:17,000
I'm happy for my former roommate

4423
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:19,000
Because he found someone to move in with him

4424
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:21,000
But just that

4425
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:23,000
Having to go back to San Francisco one last time

4426
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:25,000
And just unpacking in general

4427
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:27,000
Is obnoxious

4428
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:29,000
Otherwise, that's all

4429
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:31,000
Pretty minor

4430
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:33,000
Yeah, I don't have a lot to be angsty about

4431
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:35,000
I mean, there's a lot of really good stuff going on for me right now

4432
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:37,000
A lot of, like, happy news

4433
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:39,000
I don't want to make you par for nothing

4434
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:41,000
But it's good stuff

4435
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:43,000
I will say FU to that freakin' headache I had earlier

4436
02:29:43,000 --> 02:29:45,000
That was almost migraine status

4437
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:47,000
I would say, like, if headaches

4438
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:49,000
Were on, like, the terrorism

4439
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:51,000
Color chart

4440
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:53,000
I would say the headache I had was code orange

4441
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:55,000
It was pretty bad

4442
02:29:55,000 --> 02:29:57,000
But it wasn't, like, really bad

4443
02:29:57,000 --> 02:29:59,000
So, there you go

4444
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:01,000
Alright, that does it for the FUs of the week

4445
02:30:01,000 --> 02:30:03,000
For now

4446
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:05,000
I think Wolf is pointing out in our chatroom

4447
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:07,000
That apparently Taco Bell has a lame Flash game

4448
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:09,000
Called Taco Fu

4449
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:11,000
At TacoBell.com slash TacoFu

4450
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:13,000
That's okay

4451
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:15,000
Way to merge the worlds of tacos and video games

4452
02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:17,000
Just want to give an A plus to Bobby

4453
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:19,000
That's why he has his own show, folks

4454
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:21,000
Burger King's, uh, Reigning

4455
02:30:21,000 --> 02:30:23,000
Dude, those, like, Sneak King and shit

4456
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:25,000
Those games were awesome

4457
02:30:25,000 --> 02:30:27,000
Like, why? Like, for five bucks, they were great

4458
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:29,000
Why? Why didn't they ever do that again?

4459
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:31,000
They should do an update

4460
02:30:31,000 --> 02:30:33,000
They should do Burger Time and call it Taco Time

4461
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:35,000
Weren't they supposed to do something with, uh, Kinect, I thought?

4462
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:37,000
I think they are making a new

4463
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:39,000
But they should do Taco Time

4464
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:41,000
They are making a new Burger Time

4465
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:43,000
It should be Taco Time

4466
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:45,000
Okay, how about Choco Taco Time?

4467
02:30:45,000 --> 02:30:47,000
The villain that tries to, um, kill you

4468
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:49,000
In Taco Time is the diarrhea monster

4469
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:51,000
It's Montezuma

4470
02:30:51,000 --> 02:30:53,000
Wow, you guys are mature

4471
02:30:53,000 --> 02:30:55,000
Alright, two more stories

4472
02:30:55,000 --> 02:30:57,000
Then we're gonna get to the phones

4473
02:30:57,000 --> 02:30:59,000
Two more news stories

4474
02:30:59,000 --> 02:31:01,000
So, uh, Salacious Pop

4475
02:31:01,000 --> 02:31:03,000
Okay, so

4476
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:05,000
Ubisoft is developing

4477
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:07,000
A guitar game

4478
02:31:07,000 --> 02:31:09,000
It seems like maybe they'd be a little

4479
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:11,000
That train has left the station

4480
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:13,000
Perhaps, but, uh, they're working on a game

4481
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:15,000
Called Rocksmith

4482
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:17,000
Which sounds a lot like, uh, Pro Mode

4483
02:31:17,000 --> 02:31:19,000
In Rock Band

4484
02:31:19,000 --> 02:31:21,000
Except with a guitar

4485
02:31:21,000 --> 02:31:23,000
You can play this game with real guitars

4486
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:25,000
And the

4487
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:27,000
The UI and how the notes

4488
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:29,000
Because you know how, um, DJ Hero

4489
02:31:29,000 --> 02:31:31,000
Guitar Hero Rock Band has the, uh,

4490
02:31:31,000 --> 02:31:33,000
The note highway that scrolls

4491
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:35,000
Vertically

4492
02:31:35,000 --> 02:31:37,000
This one uses more of a

4493
02:31:37,000 --> 02:31:39,000
3D plane where you're in front

4494
02:31:39,000 --> 02:31:41,000
And you see the notes coming from the back of the screen

4495
02:31:41,000 --> 02:31:43,000
Moving towards you

4496
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:45,000
Um, so it looks really complicated

4497
02:31:45,000 --> 02:31:47,000
I'm not sure how much of a market there might be for this

4498
02:31:47,000 --> 02:31:49,000
But anyway, they are demoing the game

4499
02:31:49,000 --> 02:31:51,000
At South by Southwest

4500
02:31:51,000 --> 02:31:53,000
In Texas

4501
02:31:53,000 --> 02:31:55,000
Which is a

4502
02:31:55,000 --> 02:31:57,000
It's a music and movies

4503
02:31:57,000 --> 02:31:59,000
It's kind of like a hipster-y

4504
02:31:59,000 --> 02:32:01,000
I know, I was like, if you want to find a place where all the hipsters are at

4505
02:32:01,000 --> 02:32:03,000
At one time, like, that's not

4506
02:32:03,000 --> 02:32:05,000
Tumblr

4507
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:07,000
Yeah, but it's not like a Lollapalooza

4508
02:32:07,000 --> 02:32:09,000
There are a lot of great bands there, but it's also

4509
02:32:09,000 --> 02:32:11,000
Movies and art, and it's a whole pop culture thing

4510
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:13,000
So yeah, Rocksmith is going to be

4511
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:15,000
At South by Southwest, they're going to have musicians

4512
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:17,000
Play it, and just show it off

4513
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:19,000
I think they've got a whole Rocksmith tour bus

4514
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:21,000
That sets up

4515
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:23,000
Bass, and it's going to be at

4516
02:32:23,000 --> 02:32:25,000
South by Southwest

4517
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:27,000
Yeah, I like the way they've done that

4518
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:29,000
Where they have the guitar silhouette in front

4519
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:31,000
Of the falling stream of notes

4520
02:32:31,000 --> 02:32:33,000
It's kind of a neat little way to do it

4521
02:32:33,000 --> 02:32:35,000
Alright, we'll see if this game can actually

4522
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:37,000
Be successful, kind of break the recent curse

4523
02:32:37,000 --> 02:32:39,000
Of music games

4524
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:41,000
We'll see

4525
02:32:41,000 --> 02:32:43,000
One more story for you guys

4526
02:32:43,000 --> 02:32:45,000
Everybody get out your 40s and get ready to pour it

4527
02:32:45,000 --> 02:32:47,000
The PSP Go

4528
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:49,000
Is officially dead

4529
02:32:49,000 --> 02:32:51,000
That's right folks, pour out the 40s

4530
02:32:51,000 --> 02:32:53,000
Devastated

4531
02:32:53,000 --> 02:32:55,000
How did this happen?

4532
02:32:55,000 --> 02:32:57,000
This is, I don't understand

4533
02:32:57,000 --> 02:32:59,000
Apparently the whole thing

4534
02:32:59,000 --> 02:33:01,000
Is started by a Sony shop employee

4535
02:33:01,000 --> 02:33:03,000
Saying that the store was not going to get

4536
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:05,000
Any more shipments, and then the PSP

4537
02:33:05,000 --> 02:33:07,000
Go disappeared from the Sony store

4538
02:33:07,000 --> 02:33:09,000
Page, Sony is not confirming

4539
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:11,000
The news, but in their

4540
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:13,000
Statement, they're kind of trying to say, well why

4541
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:15,000
Are you asking about the Go? Shouldn't we be talking

4542
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:17,000
About the NGP? The awesome

4543
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:19,000
News system coming out from Sony?

4544
02:33:19,000 --> 02:33:21,000
Yeah, so

4545
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:23,000
Although Sony hasn't confirmed it

4546
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:25,000
They haven't really denied it either

4547
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:27,000
In the UK as well, the PSP

4548
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:29,000
Go production has ceased, that has been proven

4549
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:31,000
So the PSP Go

4550
02:33:31,000 --> 02:33:33,000
It's dead

4551
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:35,000
So it's basically become the sort of

4552
02:33:35,000 --> 02:33:37,000
The

4553
02:33:37,000 --> 02:33:39,000
The cousin that is

4554
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:41,000
Touched in the head that now lives in the attic

4555
02:33:41,000 --> 02:33:43,000
That the family doesn't talk about

4556
02:33:43,000 --> 02:33:45,000
Those thuds that you hear, we don't know

4557
02:33:45,000 --> 02:33:47,000
No, he died when he was

4558
02:33:47,000 --> 02:33:49,000
Born, we don't know who that is

4559
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:51,000
Some of the comments from our chatroom, of course the

4560
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:53,000
Raging comedy club that is the Orange Lounge Radio

4561
02:33:53,000 --> 02:33:55,000
Chatroom, Frisbee calls it the

4562
02:33:55,000 --> 02:33:57,000
PSP Go away

4563
02:33:57,000 --> 02:33:59,000
Let's see, Redertainment says, wait, the PSP

4564
02:33:59,000 --> 02:34:01,000
Go wasn't already dead?

4565
02:34:01,000 --> 02:34:03,000
AlphaCanandagram says, wait, wasn't this debunked

4566
02:34:03,000 --> 02:34:05,000
Saying only Europe isn't going to carry it and

4567
02:34:05,000 --> 02:34:07,000
US is still going to have them?

4568
02:34:07,000 --> 02:34:09,000
Dude

4569
02:34:09,000 --> 02:34:11,000
It's going to go

4570
02:34:11,000 --> 02:34:13,000
Sorry

4571
02:34:13,000 --> 02:34:15,000
There you go, BlackWolf would like you to know that

4572
02:34:15,000 --> 02:34:17,000
South by Southwest was actually last month

4573
02:34:17,000 --> 02:34:19,000
So we're a little behind on the news apparently

4574
02:34:19,000 --> 02:34:21,000
But that's where all the video was from

4575
02:34:21,000 --> 02:34:23,000
I believe, I think it's just being compiled

4576
02:34:23,000 --> 02:34:25,000
And put on the internet now

4577
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:27,000
So there you go

4578
02:34:27,000 --> 02:34:29,000
Alright

4579
02:34:29,000 --> 02:34:31,000
Shall we open up the Skype line?

4580
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:33,000
Yeah, let's do it

4581
02:34:33,000 --> 02:34:35,000
1877 GameOLR

4582
02:34:35,000 --> 02:34:37,000
Our username in Skype is Orange Lounge Radio

4583
02:34:37,000 --> 02:34:39,000
Now earlier in the evening

4584
02:34:39,000 --> 02:34:41,000
Bobby had a problem seeing us

4585
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:43,000
On Skype, but we assure you we're on

4586
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:45,000
And I see plenty of our regular callers

4587
02:34:45,000 --> 02:34:47,000
Signing into Skype right now, so I'm assuming

4588
02:34:47,000 --> 02:34:49,000
It's fine, but I assure you we

4589
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:51,000
Are on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio

4590
02:34:51,000 --> 02:34:53,000
If you aren't down with that though, you can always call

4591
02:34:53,000 --> 02:34:55,000
Our toll-free number, 1877

4592
02:34:55,000 --> 02:34:57,000
GameOLR

4593
02:34:57,000 --> 02:34:59,000
Of course, this is usually the part of the show where

4594
02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:01,000
I'd ask Loki if he has any last minute stories

4595
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:03,000
He's not here

4596
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:05,000
And I didn't tell anyone else to prep for that

4597
02:35:05,000 --> 02:35:06,000
Way to plan

4598
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:07,000
I have a story

4599
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:08,000
What's that?

4600
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:10,000
Taco

4601
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:12,000
Give me

4602
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:14,000
Alright, let's just go to the phones

4603
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:16,000
They're already ringing, thank god

4604
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:18,000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

4605
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:20,000
It's Legend of Zaku

4606
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:22,000
Hey, Legend of Zaku, what's on your mind buddy?

4607
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:24,000
Nothing much, just like chilling in my room

4608
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:26,000
Fixing other people's PCs

4609
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:28,000
Resting up for tomorrow's work day

4610
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:30,000
What's tomorrow? Oh, work? Back to the grind?

4611
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:32,000
Yeah, back to the grind

4612
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:34,000
The evil grind

4613
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:36,000
Evil post-Easter grind

4614
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:38,000
You want to talk about something from our show?

4615
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:40,000
Or some other stories that didn't come?

4616
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:42,000
Folks at Gearbox have been really good sports recently

4617
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:44,000
With that proposal that they did

4618
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:46,000
You know, that Borderlands proposal

4619
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:48,000
That they did for this fan

4620
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:50,000
Out in Texas

4621
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:52,000
I have the video where

4622
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:54,000
I think Claptrap, actually

4623
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:56,000
The voice of Claptrap

4624
02:35:56,000 --> 02:35:58,000
They put up a video using that

4625
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:00,000
As a way to propose to a girl

4626
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:02,000
Just pull it up right now

4627
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:04,000
Yeah, we did cover it at the top of the

4628
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:06,000
Show, or at the top of the segment

4629
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:08,000
Just so you know, you missed it

4630
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:10,000
We did talk about it

4631
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:12,000
What did you think about it?

4632
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:14,000
It's pretty good that Gearbox of all companies

4633
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:16,000
Is pretty much playing the Valve card

4634
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:18,000
And giving their fans

4635
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:20,000
Pulling all those stops for their fans

4636
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:22,000
Why do you say Gearbox of all companies?

4637
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:24,000
The way you phrase that is very interesting

4638
02:36:24,000 --> 02:36:26,000
Do you think Gearbox is trying to be Valve?

4639
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:28,000
Gearbox, you know

4640
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:30,000
One of many

4641
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:32,000
Of all the other companies out there

4642
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:34,000
Gearbox is also

4643
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:36,000
Using that same

4644
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:38,000
Basically playing that same Valve card

4645
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:40,000
You wouldn't see Sony

4646
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:42,000
Or Activision pull that

4647
02:36:42,000 --> 02:36:44,000
Pull those stunts

4648
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:46,000
You wouldn't even flip over

4649
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:48,000
For any fans that still want

4650
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:50,000
DJ Hero

4651
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:52,000
I would say Gearbox's shining achievement

4652
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:54,000
Is that they are actually going to fucking put out

4653
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:56,000
Duke Nukem forever

4654
02:36:56,000 --> 02:36:58,000
That is how history will smile

4655
02:36:58,000 --> 02:37:00,000
Upon them fondly

4656
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:02,000
Unless the game is the most atrocious piece of shit

4657
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:04,000
We've ever played

4658
02:37:04,000 --> 02:37:06,000
It's not that bad

4659
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:08,000
Even though you do mention

4660
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:10,000
Shit in that sentence

4661
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:12,000
You do know you could actually use

4662
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:14,000
Excrement as a weapon in that game

4663
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:16,000
Hooray, I'm so excited

4664
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:18,000
Yes, you could actually

4665
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:20,000
Shit bomb people in that game

4666
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:22,000
I've always wanted to fling my poo in a video game

4667
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:24,000
Where I wasn't playing as a monkey

4668
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:26,000
I'm

4669
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:28,000
I'm touched

4670
02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:30,000
Just a while ago I actually seen the video

4671
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:32,000
And yeah

4672
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:34,000
I know it's shocking

4673
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:36,000
Right now I'm just trying to gather up

4674
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:38,000
Just trying to see what I can

4675
02:37:38,000 --> 02:37:40,000
What I can get right now

4676
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:42,000
In terms of games

4677
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:44,000
I know Mortal Kombat is on my list right now

4678
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:46,000
Since it was either that or

4679
02:37:46,000 --> 02:37:48,000
Marvel vs. Capcom 3

4680
02:37:48,000 --> 02:37:50,000
But after seeing the fatalities

4681
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:52,000
A week before they got

4682
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:54,000
Before it launched

4683
02:37:54,000 --> 02:37:56,000
That pretty much convinced me at that point

4684
02:37:56,000 --> 02:37:58,000
It's either that

4685
02:37:58,000 --> 02:38:00,000
I mean, it's that and L.A. Noire

4686
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:02,000
Spring

4687
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:04,000
We're approaching some busy times

4688
02:38:04,000 --> 02:38:06,000
I think the busy time

4689
02:38:06,000 --> 02:38:08,000
Was this past week

4690
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:10,000
Something that didn't even freaking occur to me

4691
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:12,000
Is that this week

4692
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:14,000
And the next week depending on where you live

4693
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:16,000
Is Spring Break

4694
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:18,000
Usually it's either the week before or the week after Easter

4695
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:20,000
Is Spring Break

4696
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:22,000
So these games coming out

4697
02:38:22,000 --> 02:38:24,000
Like so many all at once

4698
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:26,000
Is not a surprise

4699
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:28,000
PlayStation 3 Network going down for 5 days

4700
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:30,000
That is a little bit more of a surprise

4701
02:38:30,000 --> 02:38:32,000
Hence why I think what's happening over there

4702
02:38:32,000 --> 02:38:34,000
Is really bad

4703
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:36,000
What in Japan or getting hammered

4704
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:38,000
By Anonymous?

4705
02:38:38,000 --> 02:38:40,000
I don't think this is a simple

4706
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:42,000
DDOS from Anonymous

4707
02:38:42,000 --> 02:38:44,000
Again earlier in the show

4708
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:46,000
I'm pretty sure they cracked open

4709
02:38:46,000 --> 02:38:48,000
One of their holes

4710
02:38:48,000 --> 02:38:50,000
I don't think this is

4711
02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:52,000
I think this is somebody who's done something

4712
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:54,000
A lot more serious than DDOS

4713
02:38:54,000 --> 02:38:56,000
I think personal information has been compromised

4714
02:38:56,000 --> 02:38:58,000
I think there's going to be more to develop on this

4715
02:38:58,000 --> 02:39:00,000
Again I could be talking out my butt

4716
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:02,000
That's fine I'm some schmo with a podcast on the internet

4717
02:39:02,000 --> 02:39:04,000
But when Sony isn't being up front

4718
02:39:04,000 --> 02:39:06,000
I'm left to speculate

4719
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:08,000
Sony is basically acting like any other

4720
02:39:08,000 --> 02:39:10,000
Japanese person would

4721
02:39:10,000 --> 02:39:12,000
By not revealing any damning information

4722
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:14,000
You know at the moment

4723
02:39:14,000 --> 02:39:16,000
They're trying to make it seem

4724
02:39:16,000 --> 02:39:18,000
I don't know if I'd say that but okay

4725
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:20,000
I mean as I said

4726
02:39:20,000 --> 02:39:22,000
You could draw parallels to the way

4727
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:24,000
Japan handled the whole

4728
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:26,000
Nuclear reactor crisis

4729
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:28,000
The way they were with that power company

4730
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:30,000
Aren't we getting a little

4731
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:32,000
Okay isn't this a little

4732
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:34,000
Tinfoil hat

4733
02:39:34,000 --> 02:39:36,000
No it's like any government

4734
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:38,000
The Japanese are very

4735
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:40,000
They're open about it

4736
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:42,000
They're basically

4737
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:44,000
They openly lie to people

4738
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:46,000
So that way they can look good

4739
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:48,000
Not necessarily panic

4740
02:39:48,000 --> 02:39:50,000
Because would you rather

4741
02:39:50,000 --> 02:39:52,000
Hear from Sony that personal information

4742
02:39:52,000 --> 02:39:54,000
Has been compromised now

4743
02:39:54,000 --> 02:39:56,000
And then you're going to have people bitching in the forums

4744
02:39:56,000 --> 02:39:58,000
And everywhere else and congress getting involved

4745
02:39:58,000 --> 02:40:00,000
Or would you rather have that later on

4746
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:02,000
When it's less of a problem

4747
02:40:02,000 --> 02:40:04,000
And they're actually back online

4748
02:40:04,000 --> 02:40:06,000
I would rather have it now

4749
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:08,000
Because it's my fucking information

4750
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:10,000
Well that's up to Sony to decide

4751
02:40:10,000 --> 02:40:12,000
They personally have it in their possession

4752
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:14,000
You gave it to them as a contract

4753
02:40:14,000 --> 02:40:16,000
Of which you know to join PSN

4754
02:40:16,000 --> 02:40:18,000
So it's not like you can get it

4755
02:40:18,000 --> 02:40:22,000
Back somehow

4756
02:40:22,000 --> 02:40:24,000
But you have to realize that

4757
02:40:24,000 --> 02:40:26,000
I'm pretty certain it's a lot worse than

4758
02:40:26,000 --> 02:40:28,000
What they're actually going to say

4759
02:40:28,000 --> 02:40:30,000
They don't want to create panic

4760
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:32,000
Or else that's going to hurt their stock

4761
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:34,000
That's going to hurt their reputation

4762
02:40:34,000 --> 02:40:36,000
What about their legal obligation

4763
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:38,000
From doing business in the state of California

4764
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:40,000
And the United States

4765
02:40:40,000 --> 02:40:42,000
Where they are an entity

4766
02:40:42,000 --> 02:40:44,000
We've already had the whole

4767
02:40:44,000 --> 02:40:46,000
They are a California company

4768
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:48,000
Has been established before

4769
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:50,000
And they are going to have to disclose

4770
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:52,000
If personal information has been compromised

4771
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:54,000
They have to

4772
02:40:54,000 --> 02:40:56,000
And that's all part of the panic

4773
02:40:56,000 --> 02:40:58,000
If they say that

4774
02:40:58,000 --> 02:41:00,000
If they say that now

4775
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:02,000
Unless they find a way to do damage control

4776
02:41:02,000 --> 02:41:04,000
Then it's going to sink

4777
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:06,000
Their stock pretty fast

4778
02:41:06,000 --> 02:41:08,000
Unless they find a way to

4779
02:41:08,000 --> 02:41:10,000
To say it in a way

4780
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:12,000
Where it's not that big of a threat

4781
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:14,000
Even though it actually is

4782
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:16,000
But that's the whole point

4783
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:18,000
They have to, from a PR perspective

4784
02:41:18,000 --> 02:41:20,000
They have to release it

4785
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:22,000
In a way that it doesn't impact

4786
02:41:22,000 --> 02:41:24,000
Their reputation

4787
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:26,000
And whatever else they have on the line

4788
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:28,000
Next week

4789
02:41:28,000 --> 02:41:30,000
I think we can both agree that next week

4790
02:41:30,000 --> 02:41:32,000
Is going to be a very interesting week

4791
02:41:32,000 --> 02:41:34,000
And hopefully we're not sitting here a week from now

4792
02:41:34,000 --> 02:41:36,000
Saying no, we're on day 12 of the PSN outage

4793
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:38,000
Alright, Zacho, I gotta let you go to get more calls

4794
02:41:38,000 --> 02:41:40,000
I can't wait to see what emails we get in response

4795
02:41:40,000 --> 02:41:42,000
To your call tonight, but have a good one, buddy

4796
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:44,000
So I have a good one

4797
02:41:44,000 --> 02:41:46,000
Alright, the views and opinions expressed

4798
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:48,000
By the callers, not necessarily like those

4799
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:50,000
Alright, 1877 Game OLR

4800
02:41:50,000 --> 02:41:52,000
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio

4801
02:41:52,000 --> 02:41:54,000
SalaciousPop doing his due diligence

4802
02:41:54,000 --> 02:41:56,000
During that call finding some last minute stories

4803
02:41:56,000 --> 02:41:58,000
Gold star for you

4804
02:41:58,000 --> 02:42:02,000
South Korea yesterday voted on a curfew

4805
02:42:02,000 --> 02:42:04,000
That would prevent

4806
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:06,000
Children under the age of 15

4807
02:42:06,000 --> 02:42:08,000
To play online games

4808
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:10,000
From midnight until 6 AM

4809
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:12,000
No more all nighters for the Starcraft 2

4810
02:42:12,000 --> 02:42:14,000
It's all PC gaming it sounds like

4811
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:16,000
Instead you need to be studying

4812
02:42:16,000 --> 02:42:18,000
And I guess it's being blocked

4813
02:42:18,000 --> 02:42:20,000
On the ISP level

4814
02:42:20,000 --> 02:42:22,000
The DNS to the gaming servers

4815
02:42:22,000 --> 02:42:24,000
If the parents register that they have a kid

4816
02:42:24,000 --> 02:42:26,000
They get cut off

4817
02:42:26,000 --> 02:42:28,000
Kinda scary what the government can do at that level

4818
02:42:28,000 --> 02:42:30,000
It's very interesting

4819
02:42:30,000 --> 02:42:32,000
Alright, we got a phone call, hold on

4820
02:42:32,000 --> 02:42:34,000
We'll revisit this thought in a minute

4821
02:42:34,000 --> 02:42:36,000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

4822
02:42:36,000 --> 02:42:38,000
Hey guys, this is Blue Swim

4823
02:42:38,000 --> 02:42:40,000
I'm doing just fine, how about you guys?

4824
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:42,000
Good, I wish we had more callers calling

4825
02:42:42,000 --> 02:42:44,000
Hey guys!

4826
02:42:44,000 --> 02:42:46,000
Hey, first time caller as well

4827
02:42:46,000 --> 02:42:48,000
Yes, that's true

4828
02:42:48,000 --> 02:42:50,000
What's on your mind, Blue Swim?

4829
02:42:50,000 --> 02:42:52,000
I was wondering what you guys thought of

4830
02:42:52,000 --> 02:42:54,000
Blaze Blue Continuum Shift 2

4831
02:42:54,000 --> 02:42:56,000
And Dead or Alive Dimensions

4832
02:42:56,000 --> 02:42:58,000
Going practically head to head

4833
02:42:58,000 --> 02:43:00,000
At the end of May

4834
02:43:00,000 --> 02:43:02,000
Well, you know

4835
02:43:02,000 --> 02:43:04,000
It's not the first time that fighters

4836
02:43:04,000 --> 02:43:06,000
Have really gone against each other, I don't think

4837
02:43:06,000 --> 02:43:08,000
Didn't Street Fighter 4 come out

4838
02:43:08,000 --> 02:43:10,000
At the same time as

4839
02:43:10,000 --> 02:43:12,000
Oh god, there was something else

4840
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:14,000
That came out, I thought right around the same time

4841
02:43:14,000 --> 02:43:16,000
Maybe somebody in chat will get me

4842
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:18,000
Yeah, but we ignored it because it was Street Fighter 4 coming out

4843
02:43:18,000 --> 02:43:20,000
For real

4844
02:43:20,000 --> 02:43:22,000
I think these two series

4845
02:43:22,000 --> 02:43:24,000
Are kind of separate enough

4846
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:26,000
Where they can coexist peacefully

4847
02:43:26,000 --> 02:43:28,000
Because let's face it, Blaze Blue, Blazblue

4848
02:43:28,000 --> 02:43:30,000
Whatever you want to call it

4849
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:32,000
Very heavily Japanese influenced

4850
02:43:32,000 --> 02:43:34,000
Very anime, very, you know

4851
02:43:34,000 --> 02:43:36,000
Dead or Alive

4852
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:38,000
As much as it's very Japanese

4853
02:43:38,000 --> 02:43:40,000
As well, don't get me wrong

4854
02:43:40,000 --> 02:43:42,000
It's very much more for the T&A audience

4855
02:43:42,000 --> 02:43:44,000
And it kind of

4856
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:46,000
There you go, it's more of the Texas game

4857
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:48,000
Because everything's bigger in Texas

4858
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:50,000
And

4859
02:43:50,000 --> 02:43:52,000
So that's kind of why I'm like

4860
02:43:52,000 --> 02:43:54,000
I think these two games can coexist

4861
02:43:54,000 --> 02:43:56,000
They have very different audiences

4862
02:43:56,000 --> 02:43:58,000
Do you think that

4863
02:43:58,000 --> 02:44:00,000
You know, with the 3DS

4864
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:02,000
Having three major

4865
02:44:02,000 --> 02:44:04,000
Fighters in the first two months

4866
02:44:04,000 --> 02:44:06,000
Of its life, it's going to turn it into a

4867
02:44:06,000 --> 02:44:08,000
Portable fighting game

4868
02:44:08,000 --> 02:44:10,000
Like the portable gaming

4869
02:44:10,000 --> 02:44:12,000
Fighting game platform

4870
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:14,000
Yes and no, I mean when those three games

4871
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:16,000
Are probably the only three games worth owning

4872
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:18,000
On the 3DS right now

4873
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:20,000
No, I shouldn't say that

4874
02:44:20,000 --> 02:44:22,000
I also bought Pilotwings, I haven't played it yet

4875
02:44:22,000 --> 02:44:24,000
It's just, it's a little frustrating

4876
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:26,000
There wasn't a bigger title

4877
02:44:26,000 --> 02:44:28,000
But you know, looking at what Street Fighter 4

4878
02:44:28,000 --> 02:44:30,000
Does, I mean it really brings

4879
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:32,000
Pretty much the whole experience

4880
02:44:32,000 --> 02:44:34,000
Of the Xbox version

4881
02:44:34,000 --> 02:44:36,000
To the portable console

4882
02:44:36,000 --> 02:44:38,000
And what's interesting about that is that a lot of times

4883
02:44:38,000 --> 02:44:40,000
You used to hear this shit, right

4884
02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:42,000
Like when Mortal Kombat came out on the Game Boy

4885
02:44:42,000 --> 02:44:44,000
It was like

4886
02:44:44,000 --> 02:44:46,000
Experience, the arcade experience

4887
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:48,000
On the go, and it's like

4888
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:50,000
Dude, this game fucking blows

4889
02:44:50,000 --> 02:44:52,000
Like I've got two buttons

4890
02:44:52,000 --> 02:44:54,000
And it's all like

4891
02:44:54,000 --> 02:44:56,000
Like you know, it's got like three frames

4892
02:44:56,000 --> 02:44:58,000
A second, this game sucks

4893
02:44:58,000 --> 02:45:00,000
But Street Fighter 4

4894
02:45:00,000 --> 02:45:02,000
It pretty much

4895
02:45:02,000 --> 02:45:04,000
Plays really like the Xbox

4896
02:45:04,000 --> 02:45:06,000
Versions, I'll tell you my biggest bitch

4897
02:45:06,000 --> 02:45:08,000
About the game is the controls

4898
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:10,000
Like I think it's because I'm not a kid

4899
02:45:10,000 --> 02:45:12,000
And I have fat hands

4900
02:45:12,000 --> 02:45:14,000
But the 3DS thing does not feel

4901
02:45:14,000 --> 02:45:16,000
Very good in my fat hands for trying to play

4902
02:45:16,000 --> 02:45:18,000
A fighter with the L and R buttons and everything

4903
02:45:18,000 --> 02:45:20,000
The analog thumb thing

4904
02:45:20,000 --> 02:45:22,000
In my opinion is too slippery

4905
02:45:22,000 --> 02:45:24,000
And the D-pad is too small

4906
02:45:24,000 --> 02:45:26,000
For my giant spindly man hands

4907
02:45:26,000 --> 02:45:28,000
And I don't like where the D-pad is positioned

4908
02:45:28,000 --> 02:45:30,000
As far as like a fighting game goes

4909
02:45:30,000 --> 02:45:32,000
It's a little weird

4910
02:45:32,000 --> 02:45:34,000
Yeah it cramps the crap out of my hands

4911
02:45:34,000 --> 02:45:36,000
When I'm like playing Bison trying to

4912
02:45:36,000 --> 02:45:38,000
Do like a knee press nightmare or something like that

4913
02:45:38,000 --> 02:45:40,000
It kills my fingers

4914
02:45:40,000 --> 02:45:42,000
Yet I decided to go online and do the whole internet match

4915
02:45:42,000 --> 02:45:44,000
Earlier and I got my ass handed

4916
02:45:44,000 --> 02:45:46,000
To me by some asshole playing as Cody

4917
02:45:46,000 --> 02:45:48,000
Seems like every asshole

4918
02:45:48,000 --> 02:45:50,000
On Street Fighter 4 plays Cody

4919
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:52,000
And I call them assholes because they're better than me

4920
02:45:52,000 --> 02:45:54,000
What are you

4921
02:45:54,000 --> 02:45:56,000
What fighting game are you looking forward to

4922
02:45:56,000 --> 02:45:58,000
Out of those two?

4923
02:45:58,000 --> 02:46:00,000
I pretty much bought the 3DS at launch

4924
02:46:00,000 --> 02:46:02,000
Expecting the Dead or Alive

4925
02:46:02,000 --> 02:46:04,000
To be there

4926
02:46:04,000 --> 02:46:06,000
I've been a hardcore Dead or Alive fan

4927
02:46:06,000 --> 02:46:08,000
Since 2002

4928
02:46:08,000 --> 02:46:10,000
I want to say

4929
02:46:10,000 --> 02:46:12,000
It prevented me from trading in my original

4930
02:46:12,000 --> 02:46:14,000
Xbox when I discovered

4931
02:46:14,000 --> 02:46:16,000
The Dead or Alive 3 demo

4932
02:46:16,000 --> 02:46:18,000
On demo disc

4933
02:46:18,000 --> 02:46:20,000
And ever since then

4934
02:46:20,000 --> 02:46:22,000
I've been absolutely

4935
02:46:22,000 --> 02:46:24,000
Hooked on the franchise

4936
02:46:24,000 --> 02:46:26,000
I've put maybe 300 hours into

4937
02:46:26,000 --> 02:46:28,000
Dead or Alive Ultimate

4938
02:46:28,000 --> 02:46:30,000
And another 100 and

4939
02:46:30,000 --> 02:46:32,000
100 plus in Dead or Alive 4

4940
02:46:32,000 --> 02:46:34,000
I find it very interesting how they've

4941
02:46:34,000 --> 02:46:36,000
Talked about this whole it's gonna run 30 frames a second

4942
02:46:36,000 --> 02:46:38,000
In 3D but it will run 60 frames

4943
02:46:38,000 --> 02:46:40,000
A second in 2D

4944
02:46:40,000 --> 02:46:42,000
That's a distinction I don't notice as much

4945
02:46:42,000 --> 02:46:44,000
In like Super Street Fighter 4

4946
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:46,000
It kind of looks the same no matter what mode you're in

4947
02:46:46,000 --> 02:46:48,000
Did you turn the 3D off in the options

4948
02:46:48,000 --> 02:46:50,000
Menu because if you turn the slider

4949
02:46:50,000 --> 02:46:52,000
Off it will still render the game

4950
02:46:52,000 --> 02:46:54,000
In 30 frames per second

4951
02:46:54,000 --> 02:46:56,000
But when you turn the 3D option

4952
02:46:56,000 --> 02:46:58,000
Off in the options menu

4953
02:46:58,000 --> 02:47:00,000
And you're playing like offline

4954
02:47:00,000 --> 02:47:02,000
It is absolutely gorgeous

4955
02:47:02,000 --> 02:47:04,000
I haven't

4956
02:47:04,000 --> 02:47:06,000
I need to try that what a good tip

4957
02:47:06,000 --> 02:47:08,000
I'm glad we do this show see even I learn shit on this show

4958
02:47:08,000 --> 02:47:10,000
No I haven't I'm gonna try that

4959
02:47:10,000 --> 02:47:12,000
Nice maybe that's what I'm missing

4960
02:47:12,000 --> 02:47:14,000
That's gonna run very fluid

4961
02:47:14,000 --> 02:47:16,000
When I try that that's cool

4962
02:47:16,000 --> 02:47:18,000
The 60 frames doesn't carry over to the online

4963
02:47:18,000 --> 02:47:20,000
Portion unfortunately

4964
02:47:20,000 --> 02:47:22,000
But I mean if you're playing you know the arcade

4965
02:47:22,000 --> 02:47:24,000
Mode or versus mode or whatever I mean

4966
02:47:24,000 --> 02:47:26,000
It's just yeah it's gorgeous

4967
02:47:26,000 --> 02:47:28,000
Have you had any real quick before we let you

4968
02:47:28,000 --> 02:47:30,000
Go cause we gotta fit in at least one more call tonight

4969
02:47:30,000 --> 02:47:32,000
Have you had any luck with the street pass in Super Street Fighter 4?

4970
02:47:32,000 --> 02:47:34,000
Not a bit and I've been carrying

4971
02:47:34,000 --> 02:47:36,000
That thing with me almost constantly

4972
02:47:36,000 --> 02:47:38,000
You know I live near Nashville

4973
02:47:38,000 --> 02:47:40,000
And there's a ton of

4974
02:47:40,000 --> 02:47:42,000
You know ton of stores around here you know

4975
02:47:42,000 --> 02:47:44,000
Best Buy and GameStop and stuff like that

4976
02:47:44,000 --> 02:47:46,000
I have not had one street pass fight with them

4977
02:47:46,000 --> 02:47:48,000
Interesting I mean I'm hearing

4978
02:47:48,000 --> 02:47:50,000
Those things aren't activating very much and it could be a variety

4979
02:47:50,000 --> 02:47:52,000
Of things it could be that the battery life is so

4980
02:47:52,000 --> 02:47:54,000
Eh on those things that it's not pulsing

4981
02:47:54,000 --> 02:47:56,000
The street pass very often

4982
02:47:56,000 --> 02:47:58,000
That's kinda one thing I'm hearing and then the other is just

4983
02:47:58,000 --> 02:48:00,000
You know how many people carry their DS in sleep mode

4984
02:48:00,000 --> 02:48:02,000
With them everywhere they go very few

4985
02:48:02,000 --> 02:48:04,000
So I don't know I'm gonna try

4986
02:48:04,000 --> 02:48:06,000
This week I'm gonna try going to the mall this week

4987
02:48:06,000 --> 02:48:08,000
And see if I get anybody on street pass

4988
02:48:08,000 --> 02:48:10,000
At least walk into GameStop you know some of those employees

4989
02:48:10,000 --> 02:48:12,000
Have gotta have it going we'll see

4990
02:48:12,000 --> 02:48:14,000
I think that's where I got

4991
02:48:14,000 --> 02:48:16,000
Where I got one of my

4992
02:48:16,000 --> 02:48:18,000
Street pass me's was

4993
02:48:18,000 --> 02:48:20,000
GameStop and the other was like a demo unit at Best Buy

4994
02:48:20,000 --> 02:48:22,000
Other than that I haven't had any action

4995
02:48:22,000 --> 02:48:24,000
On it I never thought of trying a demo unit

4996
02:48:24,000 --> 02:48:26,000
At Best Buy that's a great idea

4997
02:48:26,000 --> 02:48:28,000
We'll see alright BlueSwip I've gotta let you

4998
02:48:28,000 --> 02:48:30,000
Go so we can get more calls but thanks for the call

4999
02:48:30,000 --> 02:48:32,000
Thank you very much have a good night

5000
02:48:32,000 --> 02:48:34,000
You too happy birthday Jamie

5001
02:48:34,000 --> 02:48:36,000
Thank you

5002
02:48:36,000 --> 02:48:38,000
See I like enthusiastic

5003
02:48:38,000 --> 02:48:40,000
Callers people that just I'm just really happy to be

5004
02:48:40,000 --> 02:48:42,000
Here

5005
02:48:42,000 --> 02:48:44,000
Exciting alright sorry

5006
02:48:44,000 --> 02:48:46,000
I want more happy people

5007
02:48:46,000 --> 02:48:48,000
Everyone

5008
02:48:48,000 --> 02:48:50,000
BlueSwip should be your role model

5009
02:48:50,000 --> 02:48:52,000
Alright other

5010
02:48:52,000 --> 02:48:54,000
Stories that you've got Salacious Popper I don't know

5011
02:48:54,000 --> 02:48:56,000
If you want to finish your thoughts on that last one

5012
02:48:56,000 --> 02:48:58,000
Well I was just saying that for the

5013
02:48:58,000 --> 02:49:00,000
South Korea gaming curfew that's a

5014
02:49:00,000 --> 02:49:02,000
Part of the world not necessarily

5015
02:49:02,000 --> 02:49:04,000
Just South Korea where people will just

5016
02:49:04,000 --> 02:49:06,000
Stop peeing when they play

5017
02:49:06,000 --> 02:49:08,000
Starcraft 2 and then they die

5018
02:49:08,000 --> 02:49:10,000
Bladder explodes and they die so obviously

5019
02:49:10,000 --> 02:49:12,000
I think there's a demand for that kind of regulation

5020
02:49:12,000 --> 02:49:14,000
I forgot to mention I played some more Starcraft 2

5021
02:49:14,000 --> 02:49:16,000
This week Starjeweled is my new

5022
02:49:16,000 --> 02:49:18,000
Favorite add-on ever for Starcraft

5023
02:49:18,000 --> 02:49:20,000
It's great you play Bejeweled

5024
02:49:20,000 --> 02:49:22,000
And then you use the points you get in Bejeweled

5025
02:49:22,000 --> 02:49:24,000
To like buy units and it's like a tug

5026
02:49:24,000 --> 02:49:26,000
Of war match it's awesome

5027
02:49:26,000 --> 02:49:28,000
Like Jamie you might

5028
02:49:28,000 --> 02:49:30,000
Actually like Starcraft 2 if I were to buy

5029
02:49:30,000 --> 02:49:32,000
That I don't know we'll see

5030
02:49:32,000 --> 02:49:34,000
Hi I'm here

5031
02:49:34,000 --> 02:49:36,000
I'm here

5032
02:49:36,000 --> 02:49:38,000
Echoing you got to fix that

5033
02:49:38,000 --> 02:49:40,000
I don't know why but I'm hearing myself come through

5034
02:49:40,000 --> 02:49:42,000
You got to fix your settings

5035
02:49:42,000 --> 02:49:44,000
But thank you for the bags

5036
02:49:46,000 --> 02:49:48,000
Alright we'll see maybe he'll fix that

5037
02:49:48,000 --> 02:49:50,000
And try calling back

5038
02:49:50,000 --> 02:49:52,000
Which nobody else but the people in this room and he will get

5039
02:49:52,000 --> 02:49:54,000
1877 game

5040
02:49:54,000 --> 02:49:56,000
OLR username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio

5041
02:49:56,000 --> 02:49:58,000
Echo123 is always a good way

5042
02:49:58,000 --> 02:50:00,000
To test this that's somebody who calls us pretty regularly

5043
02:50:00,000 --> 02:50:02,000
Though so I don't know what's going on

5044
02:50:02,000 --> 02:50:04,000
Quick last minute story Minecraft

5045
02:50:04,000 --> 02:50:06,000
2 million paid

5046
02:50:06,000 --> 02:50:08,000
Fuck that's a game I still haven't played

5047
02:50:08,000 --> 02:50:10,000
2 million people have paid for the

5048
02:50:10,000 --> 02:50:12,000
Beta access which is roughly

5049
02:50:12,000 --> 02:50:14,000
28-29% of its

5050
02:50:14,000 --> 02:50:16,000
Entire user base

5051
02:50:16,000 --> 02:50:18,000
So a third so a little under

5052
02:50:18,000 --> 02:50:20,000
A third of their player base is paid for the game

5053
02:50:20,000 --> 02:50:22,000
For a little indie sandbox kind of

5054
02:50:22,000 --> 02:50:24,000
Aspie

5055
02:50:24,000 --> 02:50:26,000
Thing that's pretty impressive

5056
02:50:26,000 --> 02:50:28,000
You know some are saying it's too early to call Portal 2

5057
02:50:28,000 --> 02:50:30,000
The game of the year when you have something like Minecraft

5058
02:50:30,000 --> 02:50:32,000
Out there

5059
02:50:32,000 --> 02:50:34,000
It has that same 3D

5060
02:50:34,000 --> 02:50:36,000
With the weird spritey problem

5061
02:50:36,000 --> 02:50:38,000
I can't play it for very long

5062
02:50:38,000 --> 02:50:40,000
I need to check it out

5063
02:50:40,000 --> 02:50:42,000
We need to play Minecraft

5064
02:50:42,000 --> 02:50:44,000
We need to have Minecraft night

5065
02:50:44,000 --> 02:50:46,000
Try to figure out why people lose their shit over this game

5066
02:50:46,000 --> 02:50:48,000
I think it's 15 euros

5067
02:50:48,000 --> 02:50:50,000
Which translates to like 20 bucks

5068
02:50:50,000 --> 02:50:52,000
Or 22 bucks US because the euros are worth more than the dollar

5069
02:50:52,000 --> 02:50:54,000
Yeah

5070
02:50:54,000 --> 02:50:56,000
I remember it being like $19.99

5071
02:50:56,000 --> 02:50:58,000
They have a demo though right?

5072
02:50:58,000 --> 02:51:00,000
Isn't there like demo levels?

5073
02:51:00,000 --> 02:51:02,000
Do you?

5074
02:51:02,000 --> 02:51:04,000
Yeah hold on I want it

5075
02:51:04,000 --> 02:51:06,000
1877 game OLR username on skype is orange

5076
02:51:06,000 --> 02:51:08,000
I'm going to try keeping it open one more second

5077
02:51:08,000 --> 02:51:10,000
Especially if that last guy can get there

5078
02:51:10,000 --> 02:51:12,000
Oh maybe I deleted it

5079
02:51:12,000 --> 02:51:14,000
I'm so bad I always forget

5080
02:51:14,000 --> 02:51:16,000
I still have Ragnarok online

5081
02:51:16,000 --> 02:51:18,000
Let's see

5082
02:51:18,000 --> 02:51:20,000
An obvious spam person out of Bulgaria wants to be our friend

5083
02:51:20,000 --> 02:51:22,000
Block

5084
02:51:22,000 --> 02:51:24,000
That's no fun

5085
02:51:24,000 --> 02:51:26,000
Alright we're going to try this one more time

5086
02:51:26,000 --> 02:51:28,000
Give this guy one more chance here

5087
02:51:28,000 --> 02:51:30,000
Let's go back to the phones

5088
02:51:30,000 --> 02:51:32,000
No it's still echoing

5089
02:51:32,000 --> 02:51:34,000
Hello?

5090
02:51:34,000 --> 02:51:36,000
Now I'm not hearing it

5091
02:51:36,000 --> 02:51:38,000
Yeah I wasn't doing it before

5092
02:51:38,000 --> 02:51:40,000
You hung up and I was like okay that's kind of weird

5093
02:51:40,000 --> 02:51:42,000
And I tried to echo and the echo came out fine

5094
02:51:42,000 --> 02:51:44,000
That's weird alright well it works now what's on your mind buddy?

5095
02:51:44,000 --> 02:51:46,000
By the way this is xlink

5096
02:51:46,000 --> 02:51:48,000
Hi xlink sorry

5097
02:51:48,000 --> 02:51:50,000
I recognize your voice at this point

5098
02:51:50,000 --> 02:51:52,000
What's on your mind buddy?

5099
02:51:52,000 --> 02:51:54,000
You know actually it was kind of funny

5100
02:51:54,000 --> 02:51:56,000
Another caller kind of talked about this earlier

5101
02:51:56,000 --> 02:51:58,000
The whole Valve thing in Portal 2

5102
02:51:58,000 --> 02:52:04,000
I was watching the whole thing as it unfolded right before Portal 2 came out

5103
02:52:04,000 --> 02:52:06,000
The ARG

5104
02:52:06,000 --> 02:52:14,000
And it's kind of cool reading the stories of how Valve gave pretty much open access to these indie companies

5105
02:52:14,000 --> 02:52:18,000
You know basically telling hey you want to be part of this come on in we'll give you full access

5106
02:52:18,000 --> 02:52:20,000
We'll help you any way possible

5107
02:52:20,000 --> 02:52:22,000
We'll give you all these materials

5108
02:52:22,000 --> 02:52:25,000
We'll do anything we can to make this work

5109
02:52:25,000 --> 02:52:36,000
And it was really cool reading some of the company stories of like how everything progressed from day one to the night of the release

5110
02:52:36,000 --> 02:52:38,000
When everything got completed

5111
02:52:38,000 --> 02:52:45,000
Is that the whole thing I heard at the tail end of Bobby's show where there's like an iPad app that Jeff Keighley was involved with

5112
02:52:45,000 --> 02:52:51,000
Where they've like chronicled the entire last development cycle of Portal is that what you're talking about?

5113
02:52:51,000 --> 02:52:57,000
Likely yes and I don't know exactly what the app has in it because I don't have it right now

5114
02:52:57,000 --> 02:53:01,000
And I don't have the money for it so I can't really tell

5115
02:53:01,000 --> 02:53:06,000
But the impression that I'm getting from our pal Bobby who talked about it a little bit more on his show tonight

5116
02:53:06,000 --> 02:53:10,000
Is that it's basically like imagine like an interactive news article

5117
02:53:10,000 --> 02:53:13,000
And when I say or I should say magazine feature

5118
02:53:13,000 --> 02:53:21,000
Because it's more like what 10,000 word article or something like that that has videos, pictures, behind the scenes stuff

5119
02:53:21,000 --> 02:53:22,000
Probably

5120
02:53:22,000 --> 02:53:27,000
Yeah it kind of sounds like honestly what more magazines ought to be doing on the iPad

5121
02:53:27,000 --> 02:53:28,000
Yeah

5122
02:53:28,000 --> 02:53:32,000
The people and how all these people, these groups of people don't know each other

5123
02:53:32,000 --> 02:53:37,000
And they're willing going hey I have a free copy of like audio surf I'm willing to give to you

5124
02:53:37,000 --> 02:53:41,000
So that way you get your potatoes so that way we can make the multiplier faster

5125
02:53:41,000 --> 02:53:46,000
So we can get you know it was very cool seeing everybody come together the squad going

5126
02:53:46,000 --> 02:53:51,000
Okay which game should we play we should play this one so this way the timer can go down more and more and more

5127
02:53:51,000 --> 02:53:57,000
And it was just very neat watching the whole thing as it unfolded it was very cool

5128
02:53:57,000 --> 02:54:05,000
That is yeah I did play I did my part I played audio surf it was fun even though I had no intention of buying it on PC

5129
02:54:05,000 --> 02:54:09,000
Because I knew I'd already had the PS3 one ordered but it was still it was you know it was fun

5130
02:54:09,000 --> 02:54:14,000
I like those things kind of get the community riled up like that and Valve is a heck of a company

5131
02:54:14,000 --> 02:54:19,000
That's really what it boils down to I mean they just has Valve ever put out a bad game

5132
02:54:19,000 --> 02:54:21,000
No not that I know

5133
02:54:21,000 --> 02:54:26,000
Yeah Valve is in a very elite group of developers that just does not put out bad games

5134
02:54:26,000 --> 02:54:29,000
And I would say Blizzard's probably in there too

5135
02:54:29,000 --> 02:54:33,000
Blizzard I don't think has ever put out a bad game until Cataclysm no I'm kidding I'm kidding

5136
02:54:33,000 --> 02:54:40,000
And then let's see what else there's got to be at least one other I'm sure there's many folks

5137
02:54:40,000 --> 02:54:46,000
Bioware has a pedigree but that's then you're getting to the more you know

5138
02:54:46,000 --> 02:54:50,000
See part of me would say well Bethesda because they put out such awesome stuff

5139
02:54:50,000 --> 02:54:53,000
And then I'm like oh but they did that Star Trek game that was really not good

5140
02:54:53,000 --> 02:54:57,000
So you know a lot of developers do have a little blemishes on their record

5141
02:54:57,000 --> 02:55:04,000
Or bizarre creations before they close but they made that Bond game that wasn't so hot so unfortunately they had a blemish too

5142
02:55:04,000 --> 02:55:06,000
You know so but there's very rare companies

5143
02:55:06,000 --> 02:55:10,000
It's in a myth market depending on what the people want at the time so I mean you know

5144
02:55:10,000 --> 02:55:15,000
And it depends on who does it to a lot of it depends on how much work they put into it you know

5145
02:55:15,000 --> 02:55:18,000
If they're gonna put it in work for six months they throw it out there in the market inspect it to sell

5146
02:55:18,000 --> 02:55:23,000
And it turns out to be a complete piece of shit I mean you know you can't really get too much from it

5147
02:55:23,000 --> 02:55:30,000
But it's obvious they took a lot of time and effort behind what they want and it really paid off

5148
02:55:30,000 --> 02:55:35,000
It paid off in big time so like I said before people were very happy with this whole thing

5149
02:55:35,000 --> 02:55:40,000
And the way it unfolded at the end so and then of course with Portal 2 being the way it is so

5150
02:55:40,000 --> 02:55:46,000
Kaiju in our chat room says Valve put out that shitty poker game I believe that was Telltale wasn't it

5151
02:55:46,000 --> 02:55:49,000
That was Telltale and it's not really that bad unless you really find it

5152
02:55:49,000 --> 02:55:51,000
It's a budget title

5153
02:55:51,000 --> 02:55:57,000
It's a budget title and it's really short and I wish they would I kind of wish they would add

5154
02:55:57,000 --> 02:56:03,000
Maybe a few extra people or extra things to it but for a budget title being ten bucks for poker

5155
02:56:03,000 --> 02:56:05,000
It's not really all that bad

5156
02:56:05,000 --> 02:56:13,000
And Telltale's about in that pedigree too I mean it kind of depends how into the games they're putting out you are

5157
02:56:13,000 --> 02:56:16,000
But they put out a lot of quality stuff too

5158
02:56:16,000 --> 02:56:17,000
Yeah

5159
02:56:17,000 --> 02:56:22,000
So anyway sorry I don't want to turn this into a developer penis size contest but you know I thought it would be fun

5160
02:56:22,000 --> 02:56:27,000
And the gearbox was very interesting too that whole story about the proposal too

5161
02:56:27,000 --> 02:56:32,000
You should watch both the videos first the video of the proposal and then how it all came about

5162
02:56:32,000 --> 02:56:37,000
Because he checked a bunch of his friends saying that he got the exclusive for the

5163
02:56:37,000 --> 02:56:41,000
Because being a big fan they gave him an exclusive for Borderlands 2

5164
02:56:41,000 --> 02:56:46,000
And it turned out to be the proposal video so it's very cute how the whole thing came around

5165
02:56:46,000 --> 02:56:47,000
Wow

5166
02:56:47,000 --> 02:56:54,000
Gearbox got off the ground thanks to Valve because Gearbox got the Half-Life 1 expansion license

5167
02:56:54,000 --> 02:56:56,000
They did Blue Shift and

5168
02:56:56,000 --> 02:56:58,000
Oh wow I didn't even know that

5169
02:56:58,000 --> 02:57:05,000
Something Force with the Marine Adrian Shepard but the Half-Life expansions that came out in 98-99 that was Gearbox

5170
02:57:05,000 --> 02:57:06,000
Well there you go

5171
02:57:06,000 --> 02:57:10,000
Alright well X-Link I got to let you go so we can wrap up the show but any other quick final thoughts

5172
02:57:10,000 --> 02:57:17,000
Nope that's about it sorry about the call earlier sorry about all that usually I don't have any of those problems I usually call Echo 1, 2, 3 beforehand so

5173
02:57:17,000 --> 02:57:19,000
Minus 50 DKP

5174
02:57:19,000 --> 02:57:20,000
Yeah no joke

5175
02:57:20,000 --> 02:57:21,000
Later

5176
02:57:21,000 --> 02:57:22,000
Later

5177
02:57:22,000 --> 02:57:29,000
Alright that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight if you didn't get through help Jamie get tacos by sending an email instead mailbag at orangelawnsradio.com

5178
02:57:29,000 --> 02:57:32,000
Well how did I fucking agree to buy her fucking tacos

5179
02:57:32,000 --> 02:57:34,000
I am awesome

5180
02:57:34,000 --> 02:57:37,000
Alright and Skype crashed right as I closed

5181
02:57:37,000 --> 02:57:39,000
Rob's great heart

5182
02:57:39,000 --> 02:57:46,000
I know alright well that's a sign that we need to wrap up the show and get on out of here so we can't wrap up the show though until we go around and get some final thoughts

5183
02:57:46,000 --> 02:57:50,000
Oh actually I should ask if you have any other quick last minute stories you want to get out

5184
02:57:50,000 --> 02:57:51,000
No

5185
02:57:51,000 --> 02:58:00,000
No you're good alright well then I will say thank you very much for being here Salacious Pop tonight really appreciate it especially on short notice and filling in for Loki you did a great job with the stories and everything

Not everybody can just waltz right in here and read the stories so really appreciate it hope you had fun

5188

Thank you as always

5189

Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners

5190
02:58:08,000 --> 02:58:15,000
Remember to go outside and don't play too much portal 2 in Mortal Kombat back to back

5191
02:58:15,000 --> 02:58:16,000
That's right

5192
02:58:16,000 --> 02:58:21,000
Alright my final thought is now I want tacos I hate you

5193
02:58:21,000 --> 02:58:22,000
You don't

5194
02:58:22,000 --> 02:58:23,000
You're right I don't

5195
02:58:23,000 --> 02:58:25,000
But right now I do

5196
02:58:25,000 --> 02:58:27,000

If that's gonna go then I hate to see episode 420
