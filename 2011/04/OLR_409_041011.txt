Sky, and Loki!
Tonight, April 10th, 2011, has the 3DS sold up to expectations in Japan?
A new Sonic game is revealed, and after many years, a Fan Streets of Rage remake is released.
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice.
We do tape live every Sunday night at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.
My name is Rob Roberts, I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-host, the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
Rob has renewed my faith in computing.
How's that?
By giving me a task of revival.
You're going to CPR on one of my dead computers, yeah.
Because I've needed... I've been going through this dilemma where I can't get Maya working on my computer.
And I'm going to put Windows 7 and dual boot Linux on it.
Right.
But in the meantime, I was like, I still really want a Mac.
So...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Also with us tonight, say hello to the one and only Techmaster Loki, who's joining us.
Hello.
And at least he has chicken.
Yes.
How you doing, Loki?
How are things for you?
I'm doing fine.
Yeah?
Just hands are sticky, so I'm trying to figure out how to hold the microphone without, you know.
All right, I'll leave you alone so you can finish chicken.
It's just a radio program we do pretty consistently every week here at 6 o'clock.
You know what?
Here's your trivia for the night.
What's that?
Sticky Fingers, the Rolling Stones album, had a zipper on the thing and also had a guy with a boner on it.
What?
Seriously, the album, it has like a shot of a guy's crotch and it had a zipper on it where you can unzip the jeans.
But the guy had a big boner when they took the picture.
How nice that is.
And it was sticky fingers.
Right.
So, there's your trivia.
We're going to get into our gaming weeks, but nobody else is in the studio tonight, just the three of us here.
You guys, though, are joining us.
Always the fourth guest with us, our chat room.
Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to chat with us live, as we do tape live on this Sunday night.
Just kind of like a live note or whatever.
We're really delayed or what have you on the feed.
I don't know what's up.
It's like two to three minutes behind when we say something and when you guys see it.
So you'll have to forgive us a little bit if we're going back to story.
Because we want to make sure the chat has a chance to get feedback on stories.
We may have to go back a little bit to do that.
I don't know why things are so – well, I do know why things are so delayed, but it's nothing we can really fix sadly.
So we're just going to have to deal with it.
Yay.
Anyhow, let's get into our gaming weeks, the types of video games you've been playing this week.
Always a nice conversation starter.
DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
For the record, I just posted a picture of the album cover with the boner.
Thank you.
I played a little Dragon Age 2.
I am finally into the second act and totally enjoying the game.
I've given up on my lesbian love because Fenris showed up.
DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
and then I could totally sleep with Isabella anytime I want to because she's a slut.
Then I we're actually going to be getting back into playing Final Fantasy, Dan and I are, but we did not start yet because he just got back on Wednesday and I'm playing World of Warcraft of course and I am almost at Exalted with the stupid drunken dwarves and I don't have to do the stupid motion sickness inducing drunken quest again.
Hopefully soon.
You know which one I'm talking about, don't you?
Where you have to drink ten things of ale and then you get all the fuzzy effects and everything.
And I'm like, motion sick, it makes me want to puke every time I do it.
Yeah, it's pretty... You gotta be careful with that because it even messes me up.
I still refuse to do the beer run for the record because it's fucking annoying.
But I finally got exalted with kiddie people and have badass shoes and a camel.
Oh My God Shoes
Done.
Alright, Loki, if you're done with your chicken, tell us about your gaming week.
I didn't play a whole lot.
Mainly just Grand Theft Auto, as usual.
Other than Grand Theft Auto, I played a little bit of Game Dev Story.
Just very briefly.
A little bit of Reraive.
Downloaded the new song packs just for the hell of it.
And that was kind of fun.
And then...
Actually, some Excitebots last night until the Wii broke.
But it was fun.
It'll be fixed soon.
Yeah, you were telling me when you came in here, like, well, I broke my Wii last night.
And I said, well, the good news is it's just a Wii.
Yeah, it's true.
And we haven't played that in a long time.
It's kind of sad, though, because I was looking forward to playing some more stuff on there.
But it'll be fixed soon.
It's not a big deal.
It's just inconvenient right now that I have to lose my progress.
It's only a flesh wound.
We ain't been so much out of Excitebots for the longest time.
It's kind of a learning curve to get back in and remember how to be so kick-ass at it.
But it's still fun.
So there's a question for DarkSakura in our chatroom from, and I know this person has this name just to get me to read it, but it's from iFarTed.
It says, DarkSakura, a question in our chatroom at chat.orange.com.
Would you recommend Dragon Age Origins and Dragon Age 2 to someone that's moderately into MMOs?
Well, my answer was, I like DA2.
I haven't played DAO, honestly.
It doesn't really have a feel of an MMO.
It just has a feel of a fun kind of adventure game.
So, I'd recommend it to anybody.
It's pretty fun.
I mean, if the type of running around and picking up clues and doing quests in different parts of towns is not your cup of tea, then go get your coffee elsewhere.
MMOs are so diverse too.
It's really hard to say.
People that are into WoW may not necessarily be into DC Universe Online.
MMOs are a pretty vast market now.
Every time I start to get just a little bit bored with Dragon Age 2, one of the characters will say something so hilarious that I keep laughing.
and then I found the experience cheat.
Well, it's more like a glitch in the game where you can get infinite experience and gold which really helped.
So now I really like the game.
There you go.
Well, I didn't find it.
Tiara told me about it but then I did it by accident because I wasn't really going to do it except I managed to get the right spots.
I was like, maybe I will.
A button.
We also have a blast from the past in our chat room tonight.
Check this out, DDR Angels in chat.
I don't think I've seen her in chat since like episode 130?
Maybe no, it's probably later than that, but still.
So DDR Angels in chat saying, you can turn the drunk effect off.
I actually never knew that.
I don't doubt that that's not true.
You can set down your graphic settings to do it.
Yeah, there's probably a way you can just go in and turn it off.
I'm lazy, and honestly... I never knew either.
I just always thought the way to not get the effects to do that, don't drink.
It's just like real life.
Wild Hammer Wild the Dailies
Yeah, but I don't do the beer run because I hate that one.
So I just refuse to do it.
I hate the Wildhammer quest, but that's a talk for another show.
Yes.
All right.
Sorry, Loki.
I don't think you were quite done with your gaming week because I see you've opened up this little... You've opened up your package that you brought with you.
Of course.
No, this week, as kind of a random thing, we had guests, celebrity guests at my work.
So...
Out of, I don't know, just trying to be funny, I guess, I had them sign my 360.
So I have my JTAG 360, by the way.
I have it signed by Orlando Bloom, Mark Ruffalo, and Christopher, what was it?
I'm trying to remember his last name now.
That was the lowest build of the three.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, it's pretty awesome.
Oh, Christopher Thornton.
It's going up on the OLR thing now.
Yeah, somebody posted the video.
We had a little video stumble on our site.
I think somebody found the, one of our authors found the video that you posted on YouTube where you're like, hi.
Well, we have guests here today and I didn't have anything for them to sign.
So I brought my Xbox 360.
I could have used it.
I printed out a picture, but why do that?
That's not as cool.
My favorite is what the guy says.
Hold on.
I feel embarrassed.
It's a hard rhyme.
I don't have anything to sign other than this.
That's cool.
Awesome.
That's Orlando Bloom, by the way, that doesn't know what the thing is.
I've never signed an Xbox.
Yeah.
Who to?
Matt.
Matt?
Yeah.
Matt, play hard.
That's what he signed it as, Matt, play hard.
Yeah, that's good.
That's awesome.
Thank you, Matt.
It's poorly filmed because I had to hold the Xbox.
My favorite is the part coming up.
Nice.
Is that the one with the Blu-ray?
Is that the one with the Blu-ray?
No, just DVDs.
HD DVDs.
Actors are real people too.
It's cool.
He's busy.
If you like, I have Spray Fixative.
So it won't come off?
I don't think it's going to come off anyways.
Well, I've had stuff come off of plastic before.
Don't wash it.
I'm not going to wash it.
No, I have a ton of signed posters and stuff by different celebrities coming in.
Not big celebrities.
A couple.
We've had like, I'm trying to think of some of the people we had.
Yeah, not really big celebrities.
But my posters are sitting under a sack of magazines at my desk.
This goes with me to and from work all the time.
So that is a higher honor for them.
All the more reason to have some fixative.
I'm moving this week.
It's something big I'm doing right now, obviously.
And I found some of my autographed pictures.
And one of the autographed pictures I found the other day was the autographed picture of Scott Wolf from Party of Five.
You got me.
That's right.
I remember that now.
Scott Wolf.
Now he's on V. He is so tiny.
Yeah.
But so dreamy.
No, they were actually really cool because most of the celebrities we have don't really make their appearance and go.
They're just all chilling in the audience with different people and just chatting up people and talking about movies and that kind of stuff.
It was really cool.
It was for a movie called Sympathy for Delicious, I think is what it was.
Something like that.
Sounds yummy.
It's kind of cool.
So, yeah, I don't know.
It's just kind of funny.
So this must be worth $3 million if the Sarah Palin one's worth $1 million.
There was a Sarah Palin Xbox worth $1 million?
Well, it's not worth $1 million.
It's put up on eBay for $1 million.
I see.
No one's going to buy it.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I think my most treasured autograph is my Paula Abdul autograph from the Under My Spell tour.
This is way before she was crazy on pills on American Idol.
Actually, I take that back.
My greatest legitimate autograph is Yoko Kanno who did Macross Plus and Escaflowne and all that.
We've got her signing one of our Macross Plus CDs.
Well, I'm going to keep having people sign it.
To dance on.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
It took up the entire page.
To Rob, if you want to get laid, climb up a chicken's ass and wait.
Love, asshole.
But his real name.
And it took up the entire page.
What an ass.
You should scan that in and post it on his Facebook.
I don't like I talk to the guy.
Fuck him.
Anyway.
It's cool.
I dig it.
Whatever.
I have to give a public thank you, by the way, to the lovely Marissa for the gift she sent me of amber oil perfume from Solstice Scents.
Very nice of her.
It smells pretty.
It smells like amber.
My gaming week.
I gotta be honest.
I've been moving, so I haven't had a lot in my gaming week.
And I hate coming on here on the show and saying, yeah, I have a video game podcast, so I haven't really been playing any video games.
But I think I have a pretty legitimate excuse.
I watched Alan play the Mortal Kombat demo, and nothing new there.
Although I keep laughing at the horrible, horrible Mileena fatality, because it's funny.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Thanks for watching!
Alright, go into our chat room with some comments on our gaming weeks.
Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com Bobby Blackwolf wants to know, how many autographs has OLR signed for others?
That's a good question.
One or two?
We had, was it the In The Groove disc that we gave away that, remember, we
yeah and the um fucked up the cover of it the TurboGrafx I think there was something we signed right and then yeah we sent the TurboGrafx to the winner and we all signed it in silver paint pen and there was um I think we sent like a thank you note or something to somebody who did something for us and we included the ferret I remember that
I got pulled aside at Fonami.
Remember the last time I went?
To sign somebody's costume prop.
Like, okay.
I might have signed one thing at PAX East.
Did you give away the orange bat or something like that?
No.
We did a new orange bat and gave that away.
Yes.
Because the original orange bat's in the closet behind you.
It's in the closet.
Yeah, I don't have delusions that we're actually famous or whatever.
I do.
I'm delusional enough for all of us.
I'm kidding.
A random listener I just ran into in an event.
I have an autographed screener from Rob Schneider.
Which is kind of odd.
He is also very short.
A lot of actors, very short.
One of those people, not short.
God, I can't remember any actors' names today.
What the hell is wrong with me?
Jurassic Park, he's now in Law & Order, Criminal Intent.
Um...
EarthgirlsAreEasy Independence Day
Blink.
Blink.
I could have had him sign it.
I was like, ugh!
That would have been hilarious.
He probably would have laughed.
He probably would have thought that was really funny.
I'm trying to think of some of the other ones.
We've had the son of the guy from on Three's Company.
John Ritter's son?
Yeah, Jason Ritter.
He came out.
He was pretty cool.
Just a lot of people.
The guy from Fargo.
Now, when I worked at GNC, I met a lot of famous people, like the remaining members of Sublime and a bunch of wrestlers.
Well, we're going to get into video game chat, right?
Hollywood chat.
Gene Siskel out before he had his whole cancer thing.
Just a couple quick comments from chat, because again, they're behind a little bit.
TigerClaw says, Loki, you better cherish that 360 for as long as you can, because soon you will see Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner in the Hulk in the Avengers movie.
That's right, I forgot about that.
Oh, awesome.
He's going to be big time soon.
He is pretty big.
I mean, he directed this movie, the movie that he came in to promote.
Oh, really?
And it was him and the...
The Christopher Thornton, because they were kind of roommates and stuff, and Christopher Thornton, he got in an accident, like a climbing accident, where he became paralyzed, and this was kind of all about him and learning to deal with that, and the movie's about him realizing he has the gift of healing, kind of like one of those spiritual healers or something like that, and what he ends up doing with it, and it's kind of interesting.
More comments from our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com Who was saying about the DSI was Defective Candy said, My greatest autograph is my DSI signed by Nobuo Uematsu.
That's a pretty good one, too.
I know who else I have that actually made me super giddy to get.
Koji Kondo.
when he was doing the Wii Orchestra thing.
An SSJ100 Matt says, I signed a shoe for Electric Sisterhood at PAX East.
See, I don't even remember that.
I was drunk.
That's what I always say when I don't remember something that probably happened.
I was drunk.
Hey, I remember where one of the other ferrets went.
I actually found one when I was moving.
You did?
You didn't bring it?
No.
I'll bring it.
Remember when the other ferrets got attached to the Katamari ball?
That's right.
At E3 one year.
All right.
Enough reminiscing.
Enough Hollywood chat.
Let's get into a little bit of housekeeping.
No show next week.
We will not be here live next week.
I gotta watch the kitty.
Loki and myself have some other things we have to take care of.
DarkSakura would be a one-woman show otherwise.
And I don't think anyone wants to be subjected to that.
Oh, I could totally go live.
It's going to be called Bitches Listen.
That's what my new show is going to be called.
Wouldn't it be Listen to Bitches?
Rob, you see what our listeners can't see?
All right.
Heart.
Only half of one.
So, yeah, we won't be here next week, but we'll be back in two weeks.
So bear with us.
Yep, that's really it.
Otherwise, visit our website at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, our Facebook at Facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio, Twitter.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio.
We're on all those sites, all the social networking stuff.
All right, let's get into some actual gaming news.
I don't know, it felt like after last week, this is kind of a slow news week, but there's been some things worth mentioning.
A few things.
So, of course, it's coming out now, reports of just how well the 3DS sold in different regions.
It says, you know, Nintendo said 1.5 million of the 4 million shipped handhelds were headed for Japan by the end of March.
And I guess according to the Japanese sales tracker, kind of like the MPD group over here, Mediacrate, there's still plenty of leftovers.
They're saying that they've only sold about 836,000 units, meaning that there's still...
I still haven't broken the 1 million mark in Japan and still have about 664,000 units left.
Yeah, I know from purchasing my Japanese system originally, yeah, it was pretty easy to get.
There were not shortages on this stuff.
Now...
I don't know.
For me, I think under a million units at launch is kind of... For Nintendo, isn't good.
You would kind of expect them to sell well with their handhelds because they have a pretty good market share over there and people are kind of gung-ho about that stuff.
But I really think what hurt them was the lack of...
You must have titles at launch.
Well, could it also be, I don't know, the earthquake and the tsunamis making people think of other things over there than just 3D stuff?
Yeah, okay, but the earthquake stuff happened, what, a couple weeks ago?
Is that right?
Yeah, I mean, okay, I get it, but, you know, there might have been some people that were waiting a little bit, I don't know Uh, no You can't deny that cut into sales, potential sales I mean, okay, yeah, I mean, the launch day should have probably been bigger But, you know, the month totals are smaller because of the tragedy
Okay, well, that's fine.
I'll give you that.
But I guarantee, you know, it's not going to catch up as quickly.
I think what the thing is, is it's not enough.
I mean, the 3D, from what I've found, just plain stuff, the 3D's cool, but there's no real must-have titles yet.
I mean, like the stuff I bought, like Pilotwings and Ridge Racer, it's kind of like...
Out of the stuff that's coming out, this is what I think are the best ones.
It's not like, oh my god, I've got to have Ridge Racer again, or oh my god, I've got to have Pilotwings.
It was just kind of, eh, okay, this is what I've got to choose from, so I'm going to pick this.
I don't think anyone's really super excited about a new Nintendogs.
That's true.
Steel Diver.
It definitely hurt them to not have a Mario game or a Zelda game or, hell, the Kid Icarus game at launch.
Or a new IP, for God's sake.
I mean, how about let's create something new?
Well, Steel Diver.
Okay.
Which I hear is...
Kind of not all that, but somebody at Nintendo feels like it's a thing.
So, you know, there's that.
That's new.
Yeah.
But it's not something that they're really promoting.
It's not like, you know, a Kirby or Mario or something like that.
It's just a game that they put out.
The Wii had the Zelda game, which was like a must-have.
I mean, it was just a great game.
The Nintendo 64 had Mario 64, which many will argue is one of the greatest games of all time, period.
Right?
Mario 64 was a launch game, I think?
Yeah.
GameCube, I don't recall having anything big.
I think it had, what, Luigi's Mansion.
Yeah, Luigi's Mansion was the big one.
Well, the first one, I guess.
But the GameCube also was challenged with sales in some regards.
And then I remember Mario 64 for the DS, and Super Mario World for the Super Nintendo, and Mario Bros.
for the Nintendo.
So it's just...
I don't know.
And then also, once again, people are kind of looking at the 3D as kind of gimmicky and also knowing their track record with just not even really peripherals with their hardware.
It's like, well, you know what?
I'm not going to buy one right away because I know in a few months they're going to announce that they're going to have a slimmer one.
They're going to mark this down or something like that.
Or they're going to add something or tweak something.
And I don't really want to wait.
Or I'm going to wait for a new...
New stuff to come out.
Or, you know, for the actual good games to come out.
Just real quick, the GameCube launched with 12 games, and some of the highlights of those 12 games of what came out, Luigi's Mansion, Madden NFL 2002, Star Wars Rogue Squadron 2, Rogue Leader, I remember that being a really cool game, Super Monkey Ball, and Wave Race Blue Storm was probably...
See, there's nothing in there save maybe the Star Wars game and maybe Luigi's Mansion or Wave Race.
There's nothing that really jumps at you, right?
But the GameCube, of course, was also pegged for not selling nearly as well as the 64 had.
So... Yeah.
Maybe launch titles are way more important.
But I don't know, like, is the launch that important?
See, I sort of see this as Nintendo trying to set the stage for the holidays.
I don't think Nintendo is really concerned with how this thing sells until the holidays.
Yeah, I think that's correct, but at the same time, though, they've got to try to get people... I mean, they don't want it to fail at any part.
They may not be as concerned with the numbers not being quite where they want them to be, but it is saying something, though, when your system's not selling out.
And it's not necessarily a bad thing, because it's good that people can find it when they want it.
It's not like the Wii where it's just impossible to find.
But at the same time, you look at what their release schedule is for the 3DS, so there's not a lot coming out.
I mean, it's pretty slim pickin's
Forever right now because they haven't really announced a lot of stuff.
Okay, both GameGuru and Actdeft in our chatroom are chiming in saying Super Smash Bros.
Melee was about three months after the release.
Well, but that's three months later, still three months later.
And, you know, who's to say we're not going to get some of these big 3DS games three months later?
We're not, because they've already announced what the launch window stuff is, and that's from... Launch window, I love that.
Launch window.
I'm sorry, launch window may be the week that it comes out, or maybe the day it comes out.
Not three months.
I don't call, you know, if you want to use that, let's say, okay, well Xbox 360's had a really awesome launch window this past five years or six years.
I really think you can't really judge this thing until the holidays because I think the Kid Icarus will obviously be out by the holidays.
I think Nintendo's going to have that stealth title that comes out at E3 which I don't think is very stealth at all.
I'm pretty sure it's going to be Mario Brothers on the 3DS and I think that'll be out by the holidays.
That'll be New Super Mario Bros.
2 or something.
New Super Mario Bros.
3D or something.
That'll be their big thing that they come out and announce at the very end that's playable on the show floor because it's coming out this holiday.
They have some good stuff.
I mean they have like
and that thing's gonna sell a shit ton of 3Ds and then by that time you're gonna be having 3D Netflix you're gonna be, you know I really think it's just so early to tell I don't think this system was really designed to have a huge launch
We'll see.
We'll see.
Absolutely.
Alright.
Moving on to some more news.
This also has to do with handhelds and the tragedy and possibly the impact it had with it.
The NGP.
Now, there's been a lot of back and forth with this this week, so hear me out here.
The NGP might – they were saying earlier in the week it might not have happened this year because of the big earthquake that happened.
And there was a report where Jack Trenton, who is the Sony Computer Entertainment America president, talking to Bloomberg saying that Sony may have to launch the next generation portable in just one market by the end of the year, which originally they were going to be doing it everywhere.
and of course a lot of people said well that makes sense you know it's it's really unfortunate what happened but yeah that would probably be the case but then it came out a little later in the week wait a minute Jack Trenton actually said they may have to delay the release of the next generation portable and the bosses in Japan namely Satoshi Furuoka who is the um
a representative of Sony Computer Entertainment over in Japan said so far we see no impact from the quake on our launch plan saying that the original Bloomberg report was wrong period so it may not be delayed after all of course this is one of those things where it's like well you don't really know until E3 you know if Sony products in the past or any history it'll be out in Japan then it'll be out in the US and Europe so you're gonna see some bit of a delay but um
I think you're going to see something where it comes out in Japan September, October, and it comes out in the U.S.
and Europe just in time for Black Friday here in the U.S., like last week of November-ish.
Sounds likely, and by putting out rumors of delay, it'd probably just raise a little bit more of the want.
Yeah.
I still feel like we don't know enough about what the system is going to bring to the table.
Yes, we had the press event before, but a lot of stuff changes, too.
And a lot of times, the things that they advertise don't really make the launch, right?
Going back into our last story a little bit, eh?
But with the PSP, though, I don't think there's really anything they announced.
I didn't make the launch.
You just add stuff later on.
Whereas, Nintendo... Oh yeah, all this stuff is, you know, gonna be there.
Oh yeah, but it's gonna be... Don't worry, it's coming out in launch window.
It won't be long.
It'll just be a couple months.
Launch window, my ass.
Come on, just say, listen, okay?
We put this out, we wanted to get this out earlier, and you know, some of the stuff's not done, so...
Still a lot of DS chitter chatter in our chat room.
Actdeft saying the DS launch titles were pretty bad too.
There were some pretty bad games at launch, but it also had the Mario 64 conversion, which had a lot of people excited because they had changed a few things with it and made the extra characters or something.
So I seem to remember Mario 64 being a pretty big deal when that first came out on the DS.
SSJ100Matt says, there needs to be a buzz for when they go into the holidays.
If there is no buzz for it, then kids won't be begging their parents to buy it for them.
UnfoldedRaptor says, what about Super Mario Sunshine or Star Fox Adventures?
Again, both those games came way later, didn't they?
Especially Mario Sunshine was way later.
That was at least a year after.
And Star Fox Adventures is something people like to forget about.
GameGuru says, Besides the PlayStation 2's big title, Grand Theft Auto 3 came out a year after the PlayStation 2's launch.
Here's the thing though.
The PlayStation 2 had a way different thing going for it at the time.
And the big thing was, it was a DVD player.
And that was right at the time when DVDs were starting to crack.
And a lot of people were buying PlayStation 2s because...
Hey, it plays DVDs and it can play games.
It's the same thing that Sony was hoping would sell the PlayStation 3.
It plays Blu-rays and games.
And, you know, now it's all about this, it plays 3D Blu-rays as well.
In fact, you know, I don't know how many of you ran out and got Tron this week, but some of the box sets, they have stickers right on them.
Blu-ray also plays on PlayStation 3, and it says right there on the back...
To watch a Blu-ray 3D movie, you will need a Blu-ray 3D player or a PlayStation 3.
So, you know, they're really setting up a PlayStation 3 as like, you know, not just a game machine.
And that was the same deal with the PlayStation 2 and why it sold very well.
And it's a really good Blu-ray player because it's one that keeps itself up to date with, you know, over the networks.
And yeah, you can with normal, like, Blu-ray players as well, but it's a little more cumbersome than just an automatic update.
Um...
I don't know, it's just, it's good for that.
I mean, I use it for a Blu-ray player more than I use it for a game system.
Remember all the shit that people gave Xbox to when it came out because it did not play DVDs unless you bought a $50 remote, the DVD playback kit.
Yeah.
Yeah.
DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
It's basically tons and tons and tons of the Galaga Armada going against you.
You have to shoot lots and lots and lots and lots of them.
This isn't bullet hell, this is ship hell.
And it's done by the same people who did Pac-Man Championship Edition.
So, very cool.
It's got a new feature called Focus Fire that gives you control for secondary aiming.
And it looks like it's pretty awesome.
It's got lots of pretty colors and swirlies and things.
Yeah, it almost looks like it's like, I don't know, like Galaga meets...
Geometry Wars meets Rez or some type of Q Entertainment game is birdie.
Do want.
There's the focus fire option.
Interesting.
But it looks like one of the things is you sort of cut through them like you're making a path and then can sort of send out something that would destroy them en masse.
So it looks pretty cool.
Very neat.
And I can link the YouTube video in the chat room.
Very cool.
I'm glad to see the Pac-Man Championship Edition team is kind of continuing forward with reimagining some other titles.
This looks a little weird, but I would definitely check out a demo at least and see if it's something I would be into.
But I love Pac-Man Championship Edition and even the reimagined one.
They put out the second one not that long ago.
It's great too.
So that's a good team, reimagining some of the classics.
I wonder what other Namco classics they should revisit.
I think we should get Dig Dug Hardcore.
That would be crazy.
I don't even know how that would work, but in my head it's really funny.
XBOX 360 and PS3
So there's some new announcements made by EA regarding their basketball franchises.
You may remember NBA Elite 11 got cancelled last year when it was apparently revealed that it's crap.
So they didn't release it.
Well, a few leaked out, but they didn't release it.
Thanks for watching!
We're making great strides and looking forward to launching a new game next year.
That lesson about giving the team plenty of time was learned the hard way through the near release and scrapping of NBA 11.
And then, of course, to fill the void for not having a new NBA simulation game, there is the NBA Jam On Fire Edition that's coming to PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade this October.
and apparently it is a follow up of course to NBA Jam that was released last year and then it's going download only just like it was originally supposed to with the release of NBA Elite 11 it was supposed to be a pack in bonus I guess if you bought the game
The On Fire Edition will be getting new opponent AI, revamped visuals, and I guess a host of new online features as well as an online road trip campaign mode and roster updates.
And apparently the new AI is going to learn your tendencies and throw them back in your face.
And apparently the game will be $15 to $20, not $50 like it was released last
Last year, and really, if you ask me, it was way too expensive for a game that was originally going to be free.
Exactly, and I didn't even really think of this in terms of, oh, EA needs a basketball game this year since their other one's going to get delayed until next year.
I always thought this was kind of like, oh, I guess NBA Jam didn't really do well, so this is their way to try to make money from it by delivering it the way everybody said they thought it should have been in the first place.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and DarkSakura.com.
So what that sounds like when the consumer hears, okay, it was going to be a packing game that was going to be released on Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network later on after NBA Elite comes out and you can purchase that separately if you didn't buy NBA Elite for $15 to $20.
Oh, but now NBA Elite gets cancelled and now it's a $50 game because they're claiming that they added some other stuff in.
Well, I'm sorry, but what did they add in that raised the price up $30?
Because I can tell you this much.
I've seen the Xbox Live Arcade game...
Back out on PartnerNet.
And they didn't add much.
Definitely not $30 much.
So that's a load of bullshit right there.
And the fact that they're now re... I would call it a re-release.
Okay, so they're tweaking it a little bit and then selling it to you again.
Well, if you think about it, that is EA for you.
They tweak things a little bit and then they sell it to you again.
That's their sports games franchises.
Yeah.
I mean, I don't know.
It's whatever.
I mean, if you're going to buy it, cool.
Honestly, last NBA Jam game didn't look that great.
I mean, it looked all... I guess it was alright, but I did without it, and I can do without this next one.
But good news, I guess, for 2K.
At least they get a...
Thanks for watching!
Which is fine as long as it's actually new content and not just crap that they're just removed out of the game and then added back in later on.
Or like, God, I can't wait for that role-playing game to come out that costs $40.
But to beat the final boss, you need the final boss pack, which you can download for $20 on Xbox Live.
Or to finish the story, you need the epilogue pack.
You know what I mean?
Yeah.
I'd be a little worried about that.
All right, well, we'll see what happens when this game's released.
If it goes over as well as everybody thinks, it will.
Anyhow, moving on to news about Sonic the Hedgehog.
Apparently, there is a new Sonic the Hedgehog game on its way out.
It's coming out for the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3.
This was announced via Sonic's Facebook page.
There was a little teaser trailer released where Sonic is running through little colored sequences of loops and so forth.
Classic Sonic is back in the game.
Let's take a look.
Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in 2011.
Taking a look here at the little teaser video here in studio.
Let's see if we can get it to load.
Of course.
Every Sega game has to have a load.
Curious if DarkSakura can stop this because I know she's a big Sonic fangirl.
Oh yeah, watch this.
The graphics look pretty cool.
I like it.
It's in high def, very well rendered.
Running through ramps and ice.
I think that's just a trailer.
Oh yeah, this is just a trailer.
Yeah, of course, I'm sure it's pre-rendered, but... It's weird to me how they do this whole, like, two Sonic things.
It's new Sonic and classic Sonic.
Yeah.
It's still a little weird.
It doesn't really tell me enough about the game, so...
I'm sure we'll be seeing more about it at E3.
But you know what the first thing that went through my head was?
Whatever happened to Sonic the Hedgehog 4 Part 2?
Remember how they had that Sonic the Hedgehog 4 Part 1?
Somebody linked me to a story earlier because I'd said the same thing on Bobby's show and I got a link to a story where I guess they say it is still in development as late as late February.
They were saying that the game is still in development.
How do we make it not suck?
I know, I'm kind of sitting here going, well, usually when you have an episodic game, you plan on releasing one episode a month, not one episode a year, you know?
Weird.
Yeah, very odd.
So, I guess there's still a Sonic the Hedgehog 4 Part 2 coming as well, but I'm also required to care about this.
But we'll see when there's some actual gameplay footage to come out, hopefully around E3.
We'll see about that, though.
Yeah, but here's my question with the whole Sonic the Hedgehog 4 stuff is who really cares?
Because, you know, the reviews on it weren't that great and most of the, you know, that was the industry reviewers and the user reviews have been pretty terrible.
So, who cares?
I mean, that's gotta suck when you're like, okay, I gotta put out a bunch of episodes now for a game that no one gives a shit about.
Damn.
You know...
It's also one of the scenes where I feel like they're always trying to reboot Sonic.
Like, let's just reboot Sonic.
Oh, we should try rebooting Sonic again.
It's like Sega's perennial answer.
Maybe it's time to retire Sonic.
Hate to go there, but I don't know.
Sonic games have been very, very hit me this early.
It's not that difficult to fix Sonic.
You make it like it was before.
The old Sonic.
Don't try to add werewolves into it.
Don't try to make it all weird.
Don't give him a sword.
Just make it Sonic.
Now, I know that you tried that with Sonic the Hedgehog 4 and it failed terribly, but you know what?
We can only help you so far.
Just make it like that, but not suck.
That's all you gotta do.
Alright, let's move on with another story here before we get into the release dates where we travel around the world and see what's coming out soon.
DarkSakura?
Well, actually, PopCap has decided to make a new label called 4th & Battery.
And you can actually check this out at 4thandbattery.com, as all one word, number 4thandbattery.com.
It is a new label to bring out experimental ideas to customers so they can be more creative, get stuff out that's a little bit, as they say, off the beaten path.
So it's pretty cool, and it looks like the first thing out is going to be called Unpleasant Horse.
and watching the trailer for this, it's very silly.
This horse is definitely not feeling pleasant.
You start off with bird and a pegasus and everything's happy and then here comes a dark horse with a little skull on its butt like this horse is just at the Chinese buffet and now it's feeling very unpleasant.
Pooping lightning.
It makes me think, though, of Bad Horse from Dr. Horrible.
But, yeah, it looks pretty interesting.
Apparently this was an idea they had before Forth and Battery came out.
But they're calling this, and I quote, it's a sandbox for PopCap's inner child.
Well, I'm playing some of the audio here in studio.
Aw, it's a little birdie.
No horse.
This definitely doesn't look like other PopCat games.
You're like, where's the jewels to switch?
Or, you know... You farted lightning.
It's like a bad horse.
Random hard rock.
I hope it's going to be fun.
I mean, PopCat puts out pretty high quality stuff.
It was something that I thought that it got rejected because of some sort of like throwing horses through meat grinders or something like that.
Just like weird stuff.
Sounds a little bit like Super Meat Boy if that's the case.
Well, I think it was only rejected because they said they classified it as like a family game, but not a family game.
Horses going through meat grinders are probably not very family friendly.
Depends what kind of family you have.
I just like in this interview on the page it says much like Honey Badger, Unpleasant Horse just don't give a shit.
I'm glad for the reference to Honey Badger.
Yes, I love Honey Badger.
And Unpleasant Horse, his name is Bubbles and is female.
I'm looking through the interview.
Her name is Bubbles.
Sorry, I just have to look at this a little bit here.
This is the honey badger.
Watch it run in slow motion.
It's pretty badass.
Look, it runs all over the place.
Whoa, watch out, says that bird.
Ew, it's got a snake.
Oh, it's chasing a jackal.
Oh my gosh.
Oh, the honey badgers are just crazy.
The Honey Badger has been referred to by the Guinness Book of World Records as the most fearless animal in all of the animal kingdom It really doesn't give a shit I love that they brought Charles Nelson Reilly back from the grave to narrate that video
Anyhow, the over 30 listeners will understand that joke.
All right, let's move on.
Let's travel the world and look at some release dates and what's coming out to a video game store near you.
Charles Nelson Reilly, rise from your grave.
Yeah, that'd be awesome.
Thanks for watching!

What is it about the Michael Jackson experience that you're looking forward to?
Oh, I just like the dancing games.
Did you ever buy that one dancing game that came out?
It's not Dance Masters.
It's not Dance Santos.
It's another one.
Dance Paradise?
Is that what it's called?
No.
Really?
I was looking at it.
No, that looked terrible.
I looked at it and then I put it back on the shelf.
Yeah, it looks terrible.
But it has Lady Gaga.
that doesn't make me buy things though Rob makes me buy things it's just like terrible and then let's see what else we've got here um not much else really this week I was looking I actually saw some of these things that made me kind of scratch my head they have like this Rock CO game capture device it didn't really say what resolution capture it is so I could not buy that um
Yeah, that's pretty much it.
Pretty much it for this week.
Good stuff, though, in two weeks, though.
Mortal Kombat and Portal 2.
I know, it's a big week.
Squee.
Damn, there went all my money.
Lots of squee.
It's going to be a shopping spree at Fry's.
It's looking far if you're into that.
and a shopping squee.
Alright, moving on to Japan.
Let's see what you can squee about for the release dates over there.
Cross Channel, in memory of all people coming out on the Xbox 360 as well as Homefront, both getting their Japanese releases this week.
Lost Planet 2 moves into the Platinum Collection this week over there as well.
Trying to look up this Cross Channel in memory of all people and see what this is about.
I wanted to see if this is a game that's out over here.
It's from Cyberfront, and I'm not seeing a whole lot with it except a scene where the characters are in swimsuits.
So this is definitely some type of anime.
It's one of those anime games that's just not going to come over here because we don't get games like that here.
Interactive stories is what they look like to me.
Why don't we have, and this is a total random topic here, why don't we have a telenovela game?
Because that would be just so random.
A Telemundo game?
Yes, a Telemundo game.
Sabado Gigante the game?
A bunch of little mini-games on the Wii?
It would be different.
There's been nothing.
It would be awesome.
I would like to see them go back and take the old Santos franchises, the Mexican wrestler superhero franchise,
That'd be awesome.
Well, they did have the Mexican wrestling game.
Yeah, and it sucked.
But, you know, I'm talking about, like, you know, something ridiculous.
You know, like, Italian Spider-Man.
You know, even though that's not real, it would still be awesome to take that fake character and make, you know, an Italian Spider-Man game.
I'm trying to see what type of shows are on Telemundo these days that they could make a show out of.
Of course, this thing's trying to... Let's see, what are the...
I don't know what the big
I'll see you next time.
Let's see, also coming out WRC FIA World Rally Championship It's coming out, that's a racing game if you didn't know From Deep Silver Moving on to the Nintendo Wii Trying to see if they have anything coming out on there this week They don't But next week you can get Billy's Boot Camp Wii Day Enjoy Diet Yet another game there

Well, we have just a few things coming out in Europe.
On 12th, we have World of Tanks for the PC.
On the 15th, LEGO Ninja Go, the video game on the DS.
And also Michael Jackson The Experience on PS3 and Xbox 360.
They don't get the Mortal Kombat joy until after we do.
So, just saying.
Those poor guys always have to wait.
Portal 2 is out on my birthday.
Hint, hint.
Everybody.
I have a Steam account.
Alright.
I want to get the PlayStation 3 one so I get the PS3 game and the Steam game, right?
I have a PS3.
That's what I plan to do.
Alright, moving on.
So this week, a hacking group named Anonymous.
I had a feeling it was Anonymous.
Yes.
Yeah.
Anonymous.
They are now apparently, I guess, battling Sony now because they're saying, we are currently investigating, or Sony is saying, we're currently investigating including the possibility of targeted behavior from an outside party.
Yes, they were getting hacked.
They already said...
Apparently, the group, so they declare loyalty to Geohot and Raph Chocolo, you know, two hackers.
Well, Geohot, obviously, the one who created kind of the...
or has the keys that people want, release some of them so that people can actually start doing homebrew stuff.
And Graf Chocolo was behind bringing Linux back to the PS3 and he's a big part of that.
In fact, he's still actually doing hacking stuff based on that.
um well basically uh you know they're saying that they're attacking um Sony's private property because we disagree with their actions and um
Yeah, and they're going to keep on doing that.
So they were attacking the PlayStation Network and Sony's websites and stuff like that.
Of course, I guess they realized that attacking the PlayStation Network kind of hurts the people that they're trying to fight for.
So they're saying, okay, we decided that we're not going to attack the PlayStation Network at this time, but they're going to find different ways to, you know, attack Sony, I guess.
One of them being that they're going to, I guess, reveal a bunch of information about Sony's upper management, including, you know...
Crazy stuff like all their personal information, email addresses, addresses, phone numbers, pictures of their family, where they live, all sorts of crazy stuff.
See, some of that stuff gets a little cray-cray.
The DOS attack is one thing, but the whole pictures of family.
When you start involving kids, I don't think anybody's comfortable with that.
But then you've got to wonder, maybe that's just a smear campaign?
I don't know.
The whole point is just to make them feel uncomfortable, I think.
Anonymous, I'm going to plead a little bit of ignorance here because I don't really fully understand what's going on there.
I know it's a big group.
I know there's a lot of people.
I know about the in-person stuff they do with Scientology and I know it's kind of a spin-off of 4chan.
I love the logo.
The logo is fucking awesome.
So nobody's really in charge there?
No, no one's really in charge.
They actually grew on 4chan.
So it's like a Borg thing.
It's a group collective, right?
Is that how it works?
I'm sure there's people behind it.
It all runs on groupthink?
Because it's, I, I, yeah, like, I don't, like, surely somebody in Anonymous says, dude, pictures of families, not okay, you know, like, it's one thing to, like, order illegitimate pizzas and send them to Sony headquarters, but when you start posting pictures of people's kids, like, that's, that's too much, you know?
And then, and then, you know...
uh sony sony sony but you know if and this is the thing too especially with any kind of radical type group it's that if they don't follow through on the threat no one's gonna take them seriously the thing oh they won't do that but the thing is i'm pretty damn sure they will and it's that sort of uh i hate to put it this way but sort of like uh
Integrity, if you know what I mean.
The fact that if they say they're gonna do it, they're gonna do it.
That gets people, you know...
Listening to them.
Well, the other thing they were too pissed off about was the fact that Sony was collecting the IP addresses for everybody that visited Geohot's site.
Well, that was ridiculous.
And they're saying, no, if you do anything with that, you go after anybody, you're going to have hell to pay.
So, the other thing...
I don't understand these companies.
Basically, Sony hired this outside company to help protect them during this DDoS attack.
They have the hosting provider for Sony.
They're belittling Anonymous' cyber attack, calling it medium strength and something that's only annoyed our network engineers.
Why would you say something like that?
That's just going to piss them off and make them try harder.
Do people not learn?
Oh, our system's unhackable.
It's the most secure system ever.
Oh, your attack was pathetic.
I've seen worse from my grand... I mean, seriously, why would you do that?
Yeah, I'm kind of surprised they acknowledged it at all.
It's like, oh great, thank you dumbass that had to open your mouth.
Now you're going to...
It's just going to piss them off.
That's all you're doing.
You're just going to piss them off now.
Great.
Can't wait to see what happens this week.
Piss who off?
See, that's just the part.
I don't know.
There's definitely got to be a lot of varying opinions within that group, such as how far do you go.
So, you know.
I don't know, we'll see what happens
and so on and so forth.
sent the email for the password reset to get to the Xbox Live account.
So, you know, your Xbox Live account is fine for now.
But this guy did this to kind of get his point across.
Obviously, the guy is the director of policy and enforcement for Xbox Live, so it's not like he couldn't get his own account back.
The hacker is named Predator, and he basically made a whole little boasting thing on YouTube and, I don't know, was kind of like talking a lot about how he's doing them a favor and so forth.
I don't know, kind of weird.
I think he's trying to be one of those hackers that really wants to get hired by the company.
But I don't know if that's really the best way you go about doing it.
But you know how companies will hire hackers to help improve the integrity of the system?
I think maybe that's what this guy is trying to do, but he's going about it the wrong way.
Especially if you get banned from Xbox Live 35 times, you're probably just a dick, dude.
It means they probably don't want to deal with you at all.
Yeah, so this probably wasn't the best way to get your point across.
Maybe a nice little heartfelt, I'm sorry, be better.
I don't know.
DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?
It's actually two games.
It's Killer Instinct.
Both 1 and 2.
Because I had to put them together.
Alright.
But the first one's really the best.
Let's check out some of this music.
The ambience from Killer Instinct 1.
This used to be my favorite music in the game.
Anyway, Killer Instinct was developed by Rare and published by Midway and Nintendo and was in the arcades in 1994.
And it was rumored to use the Ultra 64 hardware engine.
In fact, there was actually this...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
When you finished one up, the fight would pause and your new bar would fill up.
So that's how it worked.
You had combos that if you pressed the buttons in a certain order, they would just auto-combo.
And then you had your finishers that are called No Mercy.
Although other versions called it a danger move.
And it was basically violent finishers like an orchid would flash your boobs and the other person would die of a heart attack.
Unless it was another orchid.
Then she'd just stomp her feet and be jealous.
That was cute.
And then you also had humiliations where it would make people dance.
And they had different dance style.
You had the ultra combo that was basically they just go into this huge ass auto combo.
But with some of the characters you could actually keep rejuggling with extra hits at the end of the combo.
So you could get over 80 hits.
I was always really good at the 44 hit combo with Orchid.
Anyway, you also had combo breakers where if you either hit in the double digits or were in the combo link stage, you could do this little move and it would break the combo.
Combo breaker!
Anyway, so it was pretty neat.
You also could do these advanced moves right after you did a combo breaker, like Jago, for example, would have a red fireball instead of the green one.
So your characters in the first one were Fulgor, Cinder, Glacius, Jago, Ripter, Sabrewolf, Spinal, who was actually the second to last.
No, the third to last.
The second to last.
Because I think Fulgor was after him and then it was Idle.
Anyway, TJ Combo, Chief Thunder, Orchid, well it says B-Orchid, I guess it's supposed to be Black Orchid, and Idle, who didn't have any special moves at all, except he could refill his life by stomping on the ground.
It was also the first arcade game that had an internal hard drive.
and the game was actually done in pre-rendered sprites that was done by Silicon Graphics and the backgrounds were pre-rendered as a movie but the frames would adjust based on where the characters were so it was pretty cool it also used the R4600 processor it's pretty cool
Oh, you filmed.
I'm just jumping to random ones, playing little bits before you get to the second game.
There was a SNES version that had a lot of stuff cut out and way panned out, but it came with Killer Cuts, which was a 16-track remix version of all the songs.
You could actually order it through Nintendo Power, or you could get the CD if you bought the game.
I got mine because I bought the game.
and it was in a black case.
There was a Game Boy version but if you played on the Super Game Boy it had actually limited color added to it and you could play two player and they actually really toned down a lot of the characters moves.
For the Nintendo 64 there was not a Killer Instinct or Killer Instinct 2 but you had Killer Instinct Gold that was based off of Killer Instinct 2.
And that leads us to Killer Instinct 2!
Yay!
How about some new music Rob?
Working on it.
Okay.
Killer Instinct 2 is the sequel and they changed moves.
Annoying.
Which one is this?
Working.
Yeah, that was the CD version.
But it was really cool.
This is my favorite music in the game.
Now, I'll tell you, when Dan got Killer Instinct Gold, I had him, because you had to keep starting the game over to get the right music, and he actually recorded an mp3 of this for me because I wanted it that badly.
I was a big nerd.
This is when we were first friends on the interwebs.
But KI2...
Thank you for watching!
Some of the normal moves though were toned down and then you also had different blocking moves that were thrown in.
You also had throws too and then there were ways to glitch a combo and do different moves along with that.
It basically had sort of a rock, paper, scissors system with how certain moves could be tied to certain moves.
And it was really bizarre.
Killer Seek 2, for me, was a lot harder of a game.
And then you had a super bar where you could fill it up when you take damage.
And then you could do a huge super move, which was an extended version of the regular move.
And...
It had actually a parry system, so you could counter attack after a block, and all kinds of different stuff.
It was new finishing moves, all kinds of new stuff, and no humiliations though, but every character had two ultimate combos.
and you can still do ultra combos so with the characters in this one the ones that came back were Fulgor, Jago, Spinal, TJ Combo, Glacius, Sabrewolf and Orchid and all of her moves changed it was so weird and then the new characters were Maya who was the one that I used the most and according to Nintendo Power she was the worst dress of 1996 she had nice boobies
and Tusk, who was like her dude.
Kimwoo, who was actually pretty fun.
And Gargos, who was a demon lord, who was the rival of Eidol.
And you could only use them with a cheat code.
So they had different endings based on how you beat the game.
So like Jago's was different based on...
If he kills Orchid, or if he kills Fulgor, it's weird stuff.
But they had all kinds of different stuff.
With Kill Instinct Gold, which is the Nintendo 64 version that I said before, it was a near-launch title.
And it did downgrade a few things, but it was pretty darn faithful.
You had team battles where you could fight with up to 11 characters, you had elimination battles, training and advanced training, and a full option menu where you could modify stuff.
Like how fast the game went, the color of the blood button configuration and your controller pack data and unlockable content like different colors and different scenarios and faster speeds of the game.
You can make it like super fast.
And most of the full motion video scenes were pretty much removed because, hi, it was a Nintendo 64, it was cartridge.
And so they did simple animations instead.
And the game was fully rendered in 3D instead of the whole scaling full motion video.
So it was pretty close to being good.
And there actually was some censorship about that around Orchid.
In the full version, there was a scene with Orchid in the introduction, and they actually...
played it on a UK show called Game Master but it was cut when the arcade release came out so maybe someone can find it on YouTube.
Who knows?
But it won four Nintendo Power Awards and has a really good soundtrack called the Killer Instinct Gold Cuts soundtrack.
And that's it.
All right, there it is, your classic game of the week, Killer Instincts 1 and 2.
I guess 2 will have to share the stage this week.
Let's just say Gold.
Fine, Killer Instinct Gold.
But with major nods to the arcade versions.
You got it.
All right, that's going to do it for Part A of our show.
But don't go anywhere.
We've got plenty more to cover when we come back.
When we come back, we're going to get into some things such as rapid-fire news, including news on Ninja Gaiden 3.
Not the old one on the NES, but for new consoles.
Talk a little bit more about Michael Jackson The Experience, some new tracks coming out for Rock Band, some changes going on at GameStop, and Atari reboots on iOS devices.
We're going to talk about all that and more when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio live on this Sunday evening, April the 10th of 2011 as we do tape live on Sunday nights at AllGamesRadio.com.
Now, we can't play the music on the podcast feed, but I have to mention this.
That last song cut off rather awkwardly, didn't it?
It was kind of sudden.
That it did.
And we're live.
I can play clips.
You can get away with playing clips on podcasts.
We were playing a track called Work It Out from, what is this, Sonic R, right?
So let me just play, let me play the last like 10 seconds of the mp3 here, and you get to see how awkwardly this cut off.
I'm jamming, I'm jamming, and it's done.
Yeah.
DarkSakura has another podcast.
If you like OLR, you might like...
It is called Comic Insanity and it is me, Maren Marvel and Dan Shadow and we talk about comics.
And we did not have a show this week, but next week.
Frown.
We will have a show.
Smile.
Grin.
Happy face.
You can check us at infamous.net N-F-A-M-O-U-S Any more big celebrities planned for your show?
You had some guy that was on Heroes.
He was really cool.
Todd Stashwick.
Really nice guy.
Who is he?
Todd Stashwick.
He was in season four, so unfortunately it was after I stopped.
I had the same reaction.
I was like, ah, I stopped watching.
He's been in Buffy and Supernatural.
What was his power?
He was the multiple man.
Oh.
Multiplicity sucked.
The power to make you listen to any podcast.
But he's a really cool guy.
Really, really nice.
there's more coming it's hard being an actor in Hollywood too like if I had been offered the role of a hero that just made people defecate on command that would be awesome they call me the brown note if Rob thought of his nickname it would be Poopy Pants
There you go.
Well, excuse me, Mr. Poo-Poo Pants.
Where do I sign?
The Defecator.
Nice.
The Defecatrix.
Well, now that I've brought defecation in your show in the same sentence, I apologize for that.
But anything else you want to say about Comic Insanity?
We're awesome.
Listen to us.
My Side Project is a show with the one and only Extifer called The Best Lil Horde House in Azeroth called Horde House for short.
Visit us www.hordehouse.com.
If you like World of Warcraft or even if you don't, you just like digging fart jokes, join us every week.
We put new shows up about Friday.
We don't tape live right now.
Maybe someday.
We definitely want to get back into that at some point.
I do want to throw this out there.
Hordehouse.com is the website behind it.
And we've been having more and more people kind of write for the site.
And by more, I mean one other person, but we have another one planned too.
And one of the articles you just posted about how to closet your dragon was the article.
And it's about how Blizzard has kind of deflamboyantized one of the monsters that was in Warcraft.
It's been getting a ton of hits through Reddit.
It's like a controversial article and I'm very excited because it's only like the third blog post on our site.
So big things in the future at Horde House.
Lots of hordes to talk about.
All right.
That's it.
Let's move into some rapid fire news and then we'll get to your tweets.
Twitter.com slash OLR one more time.
The latest issue of the official PlayStation magazine had some neat little tidbits regarding the new Ninja Gaiden game.
Ninja Gaiden 3, which is going to be 3, not Sigma 3, just 3, both systems, you know, all playing around harmoniously.
There's some info, they're saying that there's going to be a complex multiplayer mode.
They're not really drawing any comparisons with Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2.
But, you know, it sounds neat.
I mean, everybody has multiplayer nowadays, so why not?
They're saying that also Ryo's going to be the only playable character in the game this time around.
None of these all, you know, bonus characters from Dead or Alive or, you know, the DS or whatever.
Um, they're also saying that there are going to be, um, you know, many, uh, difficulty levels, I guess.
They're not necessarily making the game easier, but they're going to try to make the game more exciting and being able to be enjoyed by everybody, um, as well as hardcore gamers.
So, uh, I'm assuming you'll probably hear more at E3 about this game because it sounds like a pretty big one.
Um,
Then of course Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan They put out a lot of weird games in Japan And there's a couple highlights that were on blogs this week One comes from Famitsu It's a cell phone game Um
That's called I Love Woman's Body Climber.
Basically, the premise is you climb up girls.
And you are climbing them.
For example, it's kind of think of like Shadow of the Colossus, but with schoolgirl anime chicks.
And you're this tiny little dude.
So you have to, for example, it's harder to climb up bare skin than, say, pull yourself up like on one of their sailor suits or whatever.
Weird shit, but it's interesting.
It sells for, I guess, 315 yen, which is relatively cheap.
Does a little song play while you're climbing the woman?
It should, though.
You know what, people?
Since the big thing is to now knock off games on Xbox Live Indie Marketplace...
There you go.
That's a niche that's not being filled.
Weird shit like that.
Scale woman's bodies to yodel music.
That'd be awesome.
I'm seriously, that would be just amazing.
That was inspired by the cliffhangers game on The Price is Right, by the way, when a little dude climbs the mountain and yodels.
Forget it.
Yeah.
Lots of old school game show references on tonight's show.
Um, okay, let's see, the next game, which I'm going to try to pronounce here, but I probably will do a bad job of it, it's, uh, Gachi Tora, um, Arem, um, Abarenbo, uh, Kyoshi in High School, and basically, this is, looks like a weird...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Why do I have a feeling like, you know, a chef being in there, you know?
Chef's soul battles, or soul nude battle system.
Basically, you scream at people and they take off their clothes, or their clothes come off, so that's what that's about, and that's on the PSP.
What's also weird, though, on top of all that, I guess you also can play baseball and do some other weird minigames in there, but it just looks very oddball.
Screaming at someone makes them naked.
If only that worked.
It's almost like Pee-wee's secret word of the day.
When someone says the word of the day, scream real loud.
And then last... Last but not least... Clothes fly off like the Benny Hill Show.
Okay.
A little bit of a disappointment.
Come on, Nintendo.
Why, why, why?
DSiWare I guess the DSi shop although not available yet much like the Wii shop games from the DSi shop cannot be run off of an SD memory card and while the Wii had a patch later on that allowed you to do that the DSi does not allow you that you have to put the game on the internal memory and that's where it's going to stay
and that's it it says apparently though of course the 3DS wear in virtual console games will be able to directly play off an SD card DSI wear that you buy new or transfer over on the 3DS still requires you to store it to the internal memory of the 3DS it's kind of a step backwards I guess is that like their copy protection?
No, it doesn't make any sense.
DSiWare is the only thing that's stuck like that.
3DSWare or virtual console stuff, oh, you can put that back and forth.
But DSiWare, no.
That's weird.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
And this thing is just fucking crazy.
Basically, it's an animation program developed by Bob Sebastian from Flat Black Films, the company responsible for rotoscoping in The Waking Life and The Scanner Darkly.
And apparently this game, or program, or whatever you want to do, you can do all sorts of crazy stuff.
You can do rotoscoping, you can do green screen, you can do time-lapse photography using this.
You can make your own animations.
all sorts of crazy stuff for $5 $5 seriously they could have sold this shit for $30 and been able to sell a ton of it but yeah that's coming out April 25th nice
All right.
Well, let's move on.
Of course, I can't play it on April 25th because they haven't released a damn store yet for the 3DS.
Oh, sorry.
We didn't finish that part of the 3DS.
Well, something you will be able to buy whenever it does come out.
You don't know Jack.
Of course, the revival just came out on the 360 and the PlayStation 3, and it's pretty damn good.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Now, it's not going to support multiplayer, however.
It will have Game Center support, and it will have 20 full episodes.
Now, I don't know if these are 20 recycled episodes in the console games or 20 all-new episodes.
I really hope it's all new.
But, yeah, the game is on its way at some point.
Battlefield 3, some people are very exciting about this, and it's going to have a lot of ads.
Hope you like your ads in your game, because Battlefield 3 is going to have a lot of them.
That's right, because, let's see, John Riccatello, who of course is the Electronic Arts CEO, he was talking to advertisers saying, quote,
Expect a couple hundred million dollars in marketing against the Call of Duty and so forth.
It's designed to take Call of Duty down.
Now, Riccatello said, kind of in a follow-up to that, that in-game advertising doesn't necessarily mean billboards.
Half of online multiplayer time is spent in lobbies, and that's where folks are expecting advertising.
So you might be seeing ads in the lobbies.
No, people are expecting advertising on TV, not on a multiplayer lobby.
that's kind of just an asshole thing to do so not only are there going to be ads on TV for the game for them to try and beat Call of Duty but there's going to be plenty of ads in the game as well that should be lots of fun
Hey, Michael Jackson, The Experience, the game that Loki's looking forward to next week on the Xbox 360.
It's already sold 3 million units globally because, you know, the game has been out on the Wii.
It's basically just dance, but it's all Michael Jackson songs.
Yeah, the Wii, the DS and PSP versions, they've sold 319,000 units in the UK.
11%, they said, of the global sales.
So that means it's sold about 3 million worldwide.
DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
And it looks like Dreams and Edge of Seventeen both have pro guitar and bass expansions available for another 99 cents.
God, I love Stevie Nicks.
She's a fierce bitch.
She is.
And then, Silent Hill Revelation, which is going to be the next movie based off of Silent Hill 3.
And Carrie Ann Moss is going to be in it as Claudia Wolfe, who may or may not be evil.
and we also have in there Malcolm McDowell who's going to be Leonard Wolfe who may or not be evil who knows we've played the game we know and then Mass Effect 3 it's not going to be multiplayer
They may do multiplayer in later games, but not Mass Effect 3.
Confirmed Mass Effect 4.
They are going to expand the RPG elements with larger skill trees and different power evolutions.
And they are not going to make the weapons as customizable as they were, but they're going to have different behavioral changes and appearance changes.
And all weapons can be used by all classes.
So, cool.
But not as cool.
Is it?
I don't know.
Alright, let's get to the Twitter topics.
Every week we invite you guys to tweet us at twitter.com slash OLR.
Let's read some of the tweets tonight.
Defective Candy tweets us and says, "...forgot my MP3 player the other day.
Was so happy I remembered about OLR's pod lines.
Phone plus OLR equals awesome."
And I had to rack my brain for a minute after reading this tweet.
I was like, what the hell is Podlines?
And then I remembered, there's this service online called Podlines where apparently you can call and listen to podcasts on the phone.
You don't even need an iPhone or whatever to do it.
So I don't really officially endorse this site, but I guess it's kind of cool what they're doing.
Apparently you can call this number, and I'm going to call it and see what happens actually right now.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Am I going to hear myself?
I guess so.
New music from independent artists.
Call Song Numbers Radio.
Well, now I don't care about these independent artists.
I don't want to hear the ad.
I want to hear me.
Wow.
It's last week's show in really crappy quality.
Tonight, April 3rd, it's last week's show.
You can listen on the phone.
Call on your cell phone.
Interesting.
I guess that's a neat idea for a service, though, and obviously they're making money off those little ads in the beginning.
A lot of people have, like, damn limited minutes plan or, you know, stuff like that.
That's true, especially nighttime minutes.
Like, if you're working a graveyard shift, too cheap for an iPhone, there's a way to do it.
All right, let's see.
Ronnie Bailey is saying, at OLR, listening to OLR.
I want an OLR autograph.
Okay, I've got a tissue.
I've got a pen.
All right.
Ronnie Bailey just needs to DM us his address and we will autograph something and send it to him.
How about an empty CD case?
We'll find something.
I might have something.
There's my coffee cup.
You would give away your coffee cup?
It's in the trash can right now.
It's a Starbucks coffee cup.
We'll find something for Ronnie Bailey.
DM us your address and we will send you something.
Yeah.
All right.
Just because you asked.
And I don't want everybody else jumping in there saying, I want free shit, I want free shit.
No, Ronnie Bailey gets it because he asked nicely first.
All right, let's see.
Tigerclaw says his tweet.
Oh, I heard about this.
This is 1 versus 100.
It's coming back, y'all.
1 versus 100 is coming back.
Yay.
Not on Xbox Live, though.
Boo.
One Versus 100 is coming back as a Facebook game.
Double boo!
Where's my fail horn for that one?
One Versus 100 is coming back as a Facebook game.
I guess the version on Game Show Network didn't do too hot, just so you know.
It's being developed by iWin.
It is being licensed by Animal USA.
And it will be the mob versus the one structure.
Individual players will be inviting their friends to join the mob to answer questions.
And I guess either knock off them or the user.
I don't really know how this works.
So there's also Facebook different modes there.
It will not just be the Xbox version ported.
It's being remade by iWin.
But if you want to play 1 versus 100, I guess you'll have to go to Facebook's.
You can put that in between your farm.
and your Knights of the Clicky.
Another tweet from Tigerclaw305.
Apparently, Kojima has been teasing a new Snatcher game.
Yay!
Now, didn't we have a rumor a couple weeks ago that Kojima was working on something new and didn't really say what it was yet?
I don't know.
Stop working on new stuff and finish the damn game that you have in progress.
Well, hey, this new Snatcher game could be pretty cool.
So, Snatcher was a text-based adventure game.
It, you know...
I remember something, I want to say about a year ago, maybe a few months ago, where folks were translating the second game in the series.
So yeah, Snatcher, I guess, has been dormant for a long time, but I guess he tweeted something like, quote, I've readied a complete Snatcher set for some reason.
So I don't know, maybe people are taking that tweet very far.
And I also hate that Twitter is now becoming a respectable news source, but there you go.
Alright, anyhow, so that could be coming soon.
It would be kind of neat.
I do remember the whole Kojima's working on something and maybe Snatcher would be it.
So we'll see.
Let's see.
I guess Actdeft is tweeting us this.
Game Boy music video is exactly what it sounds like.
It's an article on Joystick here that has a Game Boy bunch of Game Boys.
Let's see this.
Oh, see, the reason why you're hearing all these hammering sounds and things is somebody actually clicking their Game Boy and putting headphones into the slot, getting that humming noise and things like that.
I was thinking it was actually going to be like chiptunes, but no, this is somebody doing random things with an old-ass Game Boy.
That's pretty cool.
It takes talent to put something like that together.
Neato.
SilverSonic has linked us to this.
I believe this is also from Joystick.
Except he just linked us to the picture.
It has something to do with Child of Eden.
We didn't get actually linked to the article.
Yeah, Child of Eden seems cool.
I'm actually really looking forward to that game.
Some folks that were playing it at PAX...
We're really enjoying it too.
The article is about, remember, I don't know if they said that it's going to support up to like four controllers vibrating or something like that.
This is the corset, isn't it?
Something about a corset.
Oh, yes.
I do remember reading about that.
Awesome.
Let's get some more tweets.
Gamer Girl tweets us saying, Which do you think is better, Japanese versions of games or American versions of games?
That depends on the game.
Blue Swim What was the first music album and first game soundtrack you bought?
The first game soundtrack I bought?
That's a good question.
Ironically enough, it was probably DDR3rd Mix for me.
Because, you know...
I remember trying to get soundtracks online of like Final Fantasy 6 and like the old school Final Fantasy games like I was really into those musics but you know it was really hard to get musics on CD back then over here so I would say you probably have to go back to when we first you know we're really starting to see more game soundtracks come out on CD in the CD gaming era and probably something like DDR third mix for me
Well, I had, um, we had a bunch of, like, when I first moved in with Dan, we had the TurboGrafx games that we could just, you know, play the CD, because they were Redbook audio.
So, but, and I'll tell you what, I actually, I know what the first one that I personally bought that was not a, a, uh, bootleg.
We used to get those all the time.
And this was like me personally buying it with my own money by myself going out, not people sending me copies or anything or all that.
I went out and bought the Busted Moves soundtrack right when it came out.
Oh, nice.
It had the screensaver and everything built in with it and all the cool stuff.
And then I actually, that's the first one that I personally went out to buy.
I mean, we found other ones.
We've been given other ones, you know.
Bustin' Move 2, The Dancing Game, Two Mix's Greatest Hits
Nice.
Going to our chat room.
I'm catching up on chat comments because I've been reading Twitters.
Salacious Pop reminded me of something we saw the other day saying Zynga is now in the old Sega building in San Francisco.
True facts.
Driving back from San Francisco the other day on Friday.
Driving by the old Sega building.
You know you'd see that like coming off 280 going back onto 80.
You drive by that old Sega building.
Yeah, Zynga's in there now.
Doesn't that make you sad?
That's crazy sad.
That's very sad.
SJ100 Matt in our chatroom says no offense but F Snatcher Zone of the Enders please.
Actdeft follows up with that.
Where's my third Zone of the Enders dammit?
Tiger Claw says my first video game soundtrack if you can call it that is the Mortal Kombat CD and I'm not talking about the movie soundtrack but the one by the Immortals oh god I forgot about that disc oh yeah I had that too I did have that that might have been my first one too I did have that I had the movie soundtrack too, the movie soundtrack was so awesome it was sick I think my first soundtrack was Gran Turismo and then I remember DDR 4th Mix
The other one I bought.
I bought that at a con.
Awesome.
Last tweet from Blue Swim.
If you could deep fry any candy bar, which one would it be?
Deep fried Milky Ways and Twix bars and Hershey's bars.
I've never had a deep fried candy bar, so I'm not sure how they taste.
I've had deep fried Snickers.
Was it good?
I could only eat half of it.
It made me sick.
I know.
It just sounds like too much.
I don't want any candy bar deep fried.
I want them frozen.
I would say Almond Joy, because I like Almond Joy a lot.
I like almond, coconut stuff.
Not a big fan of candy bars, but if we gotta pick something, it's not really a candy bar, but it's what happens when you leave a bag of, or I should say, let me correct this, a three pound bag of gummy bears in your car during the hot summer.
It forms into a giant gummy pillow.
Mecha gummy.
Yeah.
MechaGummy if you will, sort of a Tetsuo gone crazy MechaGummy or UltraGummy.
Take that, bread that, and dip it in so you have a nice gooey pillow of fried gummy.
Thank you for watching!
I want to deep fry those.
Deep fried Hello Kitties.
So much to deep fry nerds.
All right.
That's it for Twitter topics.
Bread every single one of them.
That's right.
We're getting way off topic, but twitter.com slash OLR.
Let's get back into some other gaming news.
Loki.
Yeah.
You know, speaking of abominations coming to Facebook, GameStop has decided, hey, you know what?
Facebook people are there, yeah?
So we're gonna put a storefront there and we're gonna sell shit there because, you know...
That's what we do.
So, liking GameStop, you better believe that they're going to be letting you know, hey, hey, there's a game pre-booking.
You want to buy it?
Hey, hey.
Hey, listen.
Hey.
Maybe you should pre-order something.
You know, we got pre-orders.
Come on in and pre-order things.
I hate going in there every time they're like, so, what game are you looking forward to?
Because I know that's, so, what game can I pre-order for you?
No.
And I tell them, I'm like, I'm not looking forward to anything.
I hate it all.
Why are you in here, dude?
Because I'm buying stuff that's come out.
I'm really at that point where, yeah, I just like to go to Best Buy or Fry's or some huge store that happens to have video games.
You know what I mean?
Unless it's like some collector's edition that's super exclusive.
You do not need to pre-order anything.
You can find them in stores.
It's just like, you know, oh, you better pre-order that 3DS because you'll never be able to find it.
No, they're all over the fucking place.
It's just... Just wait.
Be a little patient.
I know that sounds really ridiculous coming from me, but seriously.
You, mister, I'm gonna pay 200 bucks for Motorstorm Apocalypse.
No.
Be patient.
No.
Huh?
It's a collector's item, okay?
Mm-hmm.
Mister, I'm gonna import my 3DS.
You know what?
I actually... I sold that, okay?
Did you make your money back?
Yes.
Wow, nice.
I would say that was awesome.
It was like renting a 3DS for a month.
Yeah, it worked out.
But yeah, I mean, so yeah, it's not a big surprise.
And of course, you know, they recently acquired Impulse and Spawn Labs.
So they're trying to make, I guess, as much of, make themselves as much in your face as possible.
And I guess, yeah, you'll be able to purchase reserve titles, view trailers, screenshots, and all that stuff.
So yeah.
Atari Games are new all over again.
Here's the deal.
You get a free shell of the game that comes with Pong for free just for downloading it, which obviously is one of the big Atari games ever, although it hasn't aged well at all.
But you can pick up a variety of addition packs for 99 cents each, and you can get extra games that come with them.
You can just buy all 100 freaking games for $14.99 if you want the old games.
Some of the games you can get, Tempest, Crystal Castles, Yars' Revenge, Combat, and so forth.
Now, usually you kind of look at this and go, great, yay, it's the same thing all over again.
But one of the cool things that it does have, you can do multiplayer over Bluetooth connections.
So that's kind of cool.
For some games.
Yeah, not everything, but for some of the games it has multiplayer over Bluetooth.
So that's kind of cool.
It's already more useful than GameRoom.
Sad.
Game Room could have been so good, but it's dead now.
They haven't officially canceled Game Room, but they also haven't put anything out for it since the end of last year.
It's left as a graveyard.
I know.
Sad face.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
So maybe Sega's not upset about that, but it's really not so much of a remake as much as a new game.
It's using new code, has 103 stages, and playable characters from 1, 2, and 3 with new abilities and new characters.
There's new enemies based off of the Game Gear ones and cover illustrations.
are added on there there is boss rush volleyball AI partner mode and other modes and a level editor so I'm watching a little bit of this and it just looks pretty neat there's a scene where you're out running a bulldozer and you have to fight walls and you can actually fight the bulldozer too that's pretty funny I want to fight a bulldozer but not really
You just like kick the bulldozer and it goes backwards and then you go back to kicking the wall some more.
And then the bulldozer knocks you over.
Man versus bulldozer.
Film at 11.
Awesome.
Kind of cool.
Damn those knee-high walls.
Always getting my way.
Someone driving a bulldozer through a building is what I want to know.
Guess I'll have to play the game to find out.
Oh, I remembered a game I did play this week because it was on sale.
It was the X-Men Arcade game.
I don't think I talked about this last week.
No, go ahead.
Yeah, the X-Men Arcade game.
Yeah, it was, you know, better in my memories as sadly a lot of the retro classics end up being.
Yeah.
Not all of them though.
Pitfall 2, still as awesome as I remember.
Just saying.
But some other games were better in my memory.
Anyhow.
I'm kind of, well, actually I'm not too excited about Mortal Kombat, but it is neat to see that there's some stuff coming to the 360 since the PlayStation 3 version does get Kratos.
The 360 though, and this is all considered to be rumor, although they do have some screenshots that kind of confirm that.
Thanks for watching!
Um, also an arena called the Pit 360, which is a remake of, uh, Mortal Kombat 3's The Pit 3.
And additionally, I guess, uh, they're saying that the DLC character Lady in Red will be offered as a free download for Xbox Live users for a limited time.
Um, also Mortal Kombat themed avatar gear available for purchase on Xbox Live as well.
Um...
No confirmation on everything, but there are some screenshots that kind of show the pit and these avatars watching the fight.
So it's a little interesting, I guess.
And then on top of that, you may remember the Mortal Kombat kind of pitch for a new reimagining movie.
of the movie series, which I really wish would have happened, but it didn't.
But instead, it became this now web series that's going to be going on.
And apparently, the premiere of this web series is going to be on the 12th.
That's right, on Tuesday.
And you can check it out, the first episode of that, including, you know, Michael Jai White's supposed to be in that still.
And it's going to have eight episodes, I guess, leading up to the April 19th launch day.
Yeah, you can check that out.
It's going to be on Machima.com.
It's probably going to be really gross.
I should show it to my mom so she can watch it.
This is gross, Rob.
What are you making me watch?
This is sick.
I think I would definitely want to check it out.
It looked pretty cool.
Yeah, it does look pretty cool.
Again, can't explain it.
I hate the Saw movies, yet I love Mortal Kombat, even when it's gross.
But there'll probably be nothing as over-the-top as what you see in the game in these movies.
I don't think I'm going to see Mileena ripping off someone's face and eating their tongue and then spiking the head on the ground.
It'd be awesome.
I did get to see the subway fatality oh yeah that's awesome it's like he holds her head on the subway so that their heads go through all the windows oh yeah and then he throws them in front of another train it's awesome you know what they should have done which have been kind of fun as like a parody of you know some of the other fighting game series do uh Mortal Kombat Extreme Beach Volleyball and actually have that where they take someone's head and spike in the ground and
Make it really ridiculously bloody.
Let's see.
Let me look at this here real quick.
Let's see if this is it.
Here we go.
Here we go.
There you go.
And there it goes.
Oncoming train.
That's awesome.
They showed a lot of... What I was looking at was the x-ray vision in the moves.
Yeah, those are like the special moves that you can do.
It's pretty cool.
I don't know.
I didn't like the demo at first, but it really started growing on me.
And I think the final game is going to do that too.
So we'll see.
So I'm going to definitely check that out when it comes out.
So, pretty cool.
Portal news.
Because Portal 2 is on the way.
I was really shocked to see that this game is literally around the corner.
Speaking of this whole driving through San Francisco thing, they have a lot of video game billboards in San Francisco.
I don't know if you know this.
I saw a Marvel vs. Capcom 3 billboard.
I saw a Super Street Fighter 2 billboard.
My birthday is April 19th, everybody!
Well, anyhow, to wrap up for your birthday, DarkSakura, in anticipation of Portal 2, there is a comic that's out now, Portal 2 Lab Rat.
That's right, it's a comic that you can read through.
It's on IGN Comics at comics.ign.com, and you can check that out.
It's a free comic, so if you want to read that, maybe that's something you can talk about on Comic Insanity.
I don't know if you do the whole virtual comics, but Portal 2 might be a good excuse.
Yeah.
Also of note, Joko, Jonathan Colton, of course, doing the music for Portal 2, I believe he's contributing to that as well, right?
Wasn't, didn't I use something he's doing, something like that?
Well, there is a new Portal, I'm sorry, a new version of Portals still alive that's going to be coming out.
I don't know if this is with regards to Portal 2 or what, but this is coming out through Twitter.
Jonathan Coulton, Still Alive, Sarah Quinn, Tegan and Sarah
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
There's something else super cool in this, Rob.
What else do you want to say?
Theremin!
That's right, there's a Theremin solo on the new album.
Woo!
Theremin!
Unfortunately, the new album isn't due out until 2013.
So this will be a little bit of a wait.
So I guess maybe this new track isn't for Portal 2.
Sad face.
I'm sure there'll be some new song from the game, though.
Everybody's all crazy over.
Theremin!
Awesome.
Maybe something with Cave Johnson singing.
The new character that's in the game.
The CEO of Aperture Science or something like that.
Which, by the way, speaking of your rant earlier, did you notice there's some bonus from getting it at GameStop?
There's some unlockable character.
I've seen the commercials.
It's not even an unlockable character.
It's a skin for your character.
Seriously, people, if you're all getting raging boners over a fucking skin...
I'm sorry, but like the pre-order bonuses for like stuff nowadays are really kind of terrible.
Like, you know, oh, you get this.
Instead of the gun being silver, it's gold now.
Whoa, gold.
That way all my friends know I'm a consumer whore.
It's an EP and something.
I have something you don't have.
No, it's not something that you don't have because everybody's ordering at the same place, so they're all going to have it.
Okay, so I was watching South Park the other day randomly.
It was on TV, and there was a commercial for the new Mortal Kombat.
And it was a commercial for people at GameStop to get the new Mortal Kombat because you get the scorpion skin, the classic scorpion skin with it.
And they did this whole Mashima thing with it, which was kind of funny.
Yeah, they've been doing that now.
But what I thought was interesting about it is that Mileena was not wearing the costume that she has in the demo.
She was wearing classic Mileena outfits.
Yes.
So, classic Scorpion outfit is not going to be the only classic outfit that shows up in the game.
Yes, there's a ton of them.
Oh, yeah.
Are they all going to be download content, though?
No, some of them, I think, actually came with the... I think some come with the game.
Like, there may be, like, a code to download one of them, but they're going to be offered later on as...
from what I've seen in places.
Yes, there's plenty of skins coming.
But the new Mileena shows way more boobies than the old one did.
And with all the gross stuff that goes on in the game, she's like smearing blood on her boobies.
It's really gross, but funny.
This is Mortal Kombat.
Mortal Kombat is funny.
Speaking of hilarious, let's go to the email bag.
Every week you guys send us emails.
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com and the hilarity ensues.
DarkSakura, stop shopping on Steam.
I'm not stopping.
Shopping.
I'll never stop.
I'll never stop shopping.
Shopping's actually good for you.
Did you know that?
It's very therapeutic.
No, it's not.
Whenever I get pissed off, I go to the outlets and spend $300.
I feel much better.
First email says, Hello, all our great show.
I wanted to give you guys a heads up on the following.
The Streets of Rage remake project.
Yeah, we just covered this.
Oops.
8 year old fan project by some very talented guys from Spain.
The graphics were all redrawn, levels were upgraded or extended, and music got remixed.
The remake is free.
I'm not affiliated with these people.
But he sent the link to it, so I figured I would link it in the chat room.
Thank you, Carlos.
Well, there you go.
Another endorsement for that project that folks have been eagerly anticipating.
Hi, OLR!
I think this is from Spazinator.
Since he's banned from Twitter, he's turned to the email bag.
I just wanted to point out a couple of relatively minor stories for the three of you.
First, there are four new free TV shows, all of which are available on both PSN as well as Xbox Live's Zune Marketplace.
Finding them is just a matter of looking under the free TV tabs on their respective systems.
A second story, or should I say non-story, I don't know, is that the PlayStation Network has been relatively severely...
was having relatively severe issues this past Tuesday.
While Sony has indeed acknowledged that there was an issue by issuing a statement via the US PlayStation blog, they have remained rather tight-lipped about the cause of the issue.
However, it is commonly believed that the issues with PSN were caused by a DDoS attack by a group called Anonymous, which we covered earlier.
I don't think that's... Well, you know, to be fair, these emails come in during the week, but I don't think it's really, like, rumor.
I'm pretty sure it's been confirmed.
They did it.
They took credit.
Supposedly, they're upset over the fact that Sony is taking GeoHot to court.
Yes.
If I know Loki as well as I think I do, I'll beat him to the proverbial punch and say this.
Somebody call the Wambulance.
Oh, no.
Sony is protecting their interest in suing a hacker.
Wah.
I show them.
Okay.
That wasn't quite a Loki rant, but it was a reasonable approximation.
I don't know.
I don't think so.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
To continue, side note, I have no way to verify this either way, but supposedly Anonymous has issued a statement, which I will paraphrase.
We wholeheartedly believe in Geohot's cause and believe he is unjustly be persecuted.
We will fight for you until Sony relents.
We will never give you up.
We will never let you down.
We will never run around and desert you.
Okay, last part was BS.
That was a variation of a 4chan joke where a discussion morphs from one topic to quoting Fresh Prince of Bel-Air just that I submitted Rick Astley for Fresh Prince.
This email was brought to you by Old Ass Jokes.
That's it.
Alright.
That does it for emails.
Unfortunately, both about topics we already covered on the show tonight, but hey, it's wherever a gamer has a voice, so send in your voices.
Chances are, though, if it's a big news story, we probably are going to hit it at some point.
You know, it is a three-hour show, just for the record.
So if you're going to email us, and that's okay, don't let that discourage you from emailing us about a big topic, a news story, but just tell us, what are your thoughts?
Are you excited?
Are you happy?
Are you sad?
Are you mad?
Tell us what you think about it.
Alright, let's see.
Let's go on to the FUs of the week.
Every week we like to get angsty.
So let's do that right now.
Loki.
Loki.
I hate doing this and this I really I'm so sad about it but fuck you to the squeeze in and the reason why is because I've been looking forward to for years trying a squeeze with cheese and just you know it looks so delicious on TV and stuff like that I finally went to the one that they just put in in Roseville and I gotta say that burger was fucking terrible it was it just
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Good luck with that, honey.
As you close your eyes, and then you get knocked out, left in the desert to die without any legs.
That's basically what this was about.
It's like, huh, I wasn't expecting that.
That's basically...
Smash, or not Smash.
Oops, why is the outro to the show playing?
My bad.
Show's over.
It's basically, I mean, it was such a disappointment.
I don't understand the draw to it at all.
Maybe it was a bad burr or something, but, you know, everybody else seemed happy about it.
It's just, I could do better myself, man.
I mean, if all it is is putting a lot of cheese on something, fuck, dude, I can put a lot of cheese on something.
My FU of the week would go to probably moving.
Don't get me wrong, I'm really happy to be moving.
The new place has so much more space than my old place did, so that's really good because I have a lot of shit.
But my FU goes to having to move that shit is really a pain in the big fat ass.
You still have to move far.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I'm gonna do what I did next time I'm hiring movers again.
When I hired movers last time, it was great.
Except for the whole stuff that they weren't able to move.
Anyhow.
Let's move on, shall we?
Couple more news stories for you guys, and then, oh god, it's the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
Uh, yes, another week, another class action lawsuit.
This time, it's towards EA, and I could have sworn that this hasn't been the first one, but apparently there is the, um, Madden lawsuit, and it's, um, this time it's not even necessarily just Madden, but it's EA Sports, Madden NCAA, and Arena Football.
Um, apparently that there is a case, uh, P...
um pickover versus electronic arts inc saying that EA's exclusive licenses foreclose competition in an alleged football video game market because the lack of competition the plaintiffs in the case claimed that this monopoly allowed EA to overcharge for its games even though EA sports games of course cost as much as you know all the other console games out there um
If you're interested in possibly participating in this, you can go to easportslitigation.com and check out the information regarding that.
Apparently, this would qualify if you bought an EA Sports football game between 2005 and now.
Yeah, X-Link was telling me about this because I guess he got an email about it on WoW.
And there was a part of me that was kind of like, is this like a phishing thing?
Or is this, I guess it is a real deal.
No, it's real.
Class action lawsuit.
You know, they give the options, you know, you can remain a class member.
And it says you do not need to take any further action at this time.
You'll automatically remain a class member.
Or you can exclude yourself and do all that stuff.
Yeah.
I've seen this a lot.
I got one from 24 Hour Fitness one time, and it was crap.
It was like, oh, you get three weeks free.
It's like, I don't want to go back there.
Whoops, excuse me.
I'm having a lot of technical fail tonight, I apologize for that.
Well, I'm surprised, Rob.
This episode's supposed to be squeaky clean.
I know, it's 409.
It's really broken and dirty.
Alright, well, since I already played a part of it, let me play it here.
I had no idea this was in the DVD.
Is this in the Tron Legacy DVD?
There's an ad for the new Commodore 64.
I guess that it's coming out because it's this whole Tron thing.
It talks about, you know, more colors and better sound and so forth.
And then all of a sudden... I didn't see that.
And we watched like a bunch of stuff.
And there's a whole Commodore computer coming out.
Now, we talked about this on the show before, that the Commodore 64 is being rebooted.
Maybe that was something special they did for you, I don't know.
I think that's something that's probably like a TV commercial.
Perhaps, but this is still awesome.
CommodoreUSA.net if you want to get it.
They are Commodore PCs.
The Commodore 64, the pricing is announced.
That's what's made these big.
The Commodore 64 is going to start at $595 US dollars.
The VIC Pro will be $895 US dollars.
And the VIC Slim will be $395 US dollars.
Now it doesn't quite say exactly what all is coming with these products.
Let me see if the website has more details on this.
It's an Intel Atom processor, so think Netbook.
Aw, that kind of sucks, if that's the case.
Okay, yay, you're showing me the damn preview again.
Let me see here, let me go to the site.
Yeah, think Netbook and think, you know, it's going to have an emulator for Commodore games on there.
Let's see, the classic recreated Commodore 64, one 12-volt DC jack, one PS2 keyboard mouse connectors, one HDMI, one DVI-D, one VGA, four USB slots.
Go to tech configurations.
Let's see, tech.
I can guarantee you right there, those boards, because they're all integrated boards, they go for about maybe $200 at the most.
That sucks, because I'll tell you, I'm not even going to lie, I really want one of these, because I love my Commodore 64, and this is what they're selling it on, too.
You can seriously build one of those cheaper than that.
I know.
Yeah, the real tech audio that's built in, the Ethernet's all built into the stupid board.
Do they even include anything else other than how much RAM was in it again?
Two DDR2s, up to 4 gigs.
Two single channel slots.
DDR2, old slow ass RAM compared to nowadays stuff.
Let me see what's in that VIC Pro, because I guess there's the VIC Pro that's coming out as well.
See, but this doesn't have that same nostalgia factor for me.
See, that's a little bit different, though.
See, this one, though, actually has a dual or quad-core processor built into it.
So, that's a little bit better.
Now, were the... How big was the Commodore 64 keyboard?
I mean, was that pretty big, or was it...
Well, they were monsters because the computer was inside the keyboard.
Yeah.
So they were pretty big keyboards.
I don't understand why they can't fit a bigger, better computer in there.
Well, it's probably the price.
You know, they're trying to... Obviously, they want to profit off these and, you know... Yeah, but I mean, hell, when I was building my...
main cabinet stuff.
I mean, they're like dual core, you know, Intel chips.
It's like dual core 2.8 gigahertz chips, you know, with two gigs of RAM and a decent hard drive and stuff.
And I built those under $200.
So they can't do that.
I mean, and that's, you know, hell, you could probably find that stuff even cheaper, especially if you're like Commodore or somebody making...
you know, a massive amount of computers I mean, you're not just a consumer like myself I don't know but, yeah, whatever you're paying for nostalgia maybe licensing for Commodore alright maybe having to remake those computers
Well, probably it's nostalgia, it's the original emulator, they're trying to get some value out of that too.
You know, obviously they want to make a profit off it, but they want to cash in on old folks like me who have the nostalgia going with the Commodore 64.
That's what it is.
All right, let's go to the Skype line.
Every week we open up the Skype line.
Excuse me, take your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR or use an email on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
The Skype line is open now.
We're going to have to wait a minute and a half for the chat room to hear that.
Well, we could also post in the chat room.
I'm going to do that right now.
Send call now.
Yeah, Loki, go ahead and read us some last-minute stories while I post that.
Sony has thought of a great idea for the PlayStation Move.
Hey, you know what sells more Move?
More iPad.
That's right, there's an iPad sequel coming out because you know the first one wasn't terrible enough.
So this iPad sequel comes with Friends.
That's right, you'll be able to have two players and two iPads at the same time.
You can be able to create your own content as well.
They're saying that I guess you can either
Thanks for watching!
PSX for Droid
It says the original Sony complaint only had to do with the trademark logo that he had put on the app's icon.
But since then, I guess Google has closed both his Android Market and checkout accounts.
So he's leaving him unable to publish any apps.
So he's self-publishing the app now.
So if you want to download the free app and then go find your ISOs, you can do that and avoid paying $7 per PlayStation 1 game.
God, I love that stuff
And finally, this is kind of cool.
Well, Evil Dead.
They're making a game now for the iPhone and iPad.
It's going to be a 3D action shooter.
It's supposed to be coming out very soon.
It kind of features these chibi characters.
Chibi Bruce Campbell.
It's supposed to be out for, I guess, $2.99 on the iPhone, $4.99 on the iPad.
And 30 chapters.
And I guess...
Lots of stuff.
It looked like the movie, but very chibi.
And then I guess it's being developed by Trigger Apps, who's made a bunch of different movie-based games for the iPhone and Android, including the Karate Kid, Green Hornet, G.I.
Joe, and Couples Retreat.
That Couples Retreat looked like a terrible movie.
The Governator
So he's putting out a comic and of course they're doing a cartoon series and apparently that cartoon series is going to become a movie and possibly a game.
And Arnold Schwarzenegger is doing the voice and I don't get it.
It looks stupid.
It looks so cheesy.
Thanks for watching!
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
One of my favorite soundtracks, like, ever on the Commodore 64.
It was Escape from Sinja's Castle.
It was like the second half of the scenes.
But the thing about the Commodore 64 version of Dragon's Lair is that it wasn't, like, they couldn't make the Laserdisc, obviously, so they had to make little mini-games out of all the scenes.
So, like, this one was a rowing game.
and many more.
And he had to jump over the holes in the floor.
It was a very tricky balancing.
See how he keeps moving forward slightly?
It's because if you let it keep going, he'll just fall off the back.
And he slips and falls.
And then there's some random scenes that are inspired by the actual arcade game.
Let me see if I can get to one of those.
See, like, this is... The hand's coming up, so he has to jump left.
Things like that.
This was, like, one of my favorite 164 games.
It was so awesome.
Anyhow, just taking a trip down memory lane, that's all.
Any other last minute stories while no one calls?
I like to party.
There's a new indie game coming out on the Xbox Marketplace called Avatar Legends.
It's going to be a role-playing game, I guess by the developer Barker's Crest.
and it actually looks kind of cool it's going to be a 10 hour single player game co-op and multiplayer for up to 6 people a level and quest editor and you can create missions to share them with your friends but you also play as your avatar and you actually get full control over them so that kind of looks neat and I guess it says you can even drop people from your friends list into the game's NPC and set up different multiplayer and stuff
Cherry Blossoms are in bloom.
Is everything okay?
Yeah, apparently.
She's like, I'm going to call you back and leave a message.
Oh, okay.
I thought, she's never called during the show before, and I was like, oh, emergency.
But I guess it's not that bad.
Oh, no, the baby has started to move.
That could be it.
Maybe the baby's getting a little more mobile.
Who knows?
How are things going with the baby?
He's doing okay.
He's wiggly.
He wants to...
Roll around and not sleep, and he acts like he's teething, but there's nothing really coming in, so.
I don't know, we took him to the park today, and that's pretty much it.
All right, we're finally getting some calls.
Let's go to the phone and take them.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
Hi, guys.
This is DDR Dollar Bill.
Wow, he's really quiet.
Is it just, let me check your levels.
I don't know if it's just here in studio.
How are you doing, DDR Dollar Bill?
Oh, doing alright.
Just figured I'd give a call and say hi.
Hi, you are kind of quiet, but I think we can deal.
You're not, like, unhearable.
What's up?
What's on your mind?
Oh, nothing.
I was trying to find a topic to talk about because I didn't want to call and turn into a bitchfest about Killer Instinct because I absolutely hated that game with a furious passion.
Hey, you know what?
It's where every gamer has a voice, so some of us like Killer Instinct.
Why do you hate Killer Instinct?
This was back when I started developing a real hatred of fighting games, especially with something like Kill Instinct where it was just memorizing bullshit amount of combos to the point of where my physics exam was easier than Kill Instinct.
But what about the whole, like, and I don't know if this is just Killer Instinct 2, but I thought Killer Instinct 1 had this too, where if you kind of just knew, like, the basics, like, you know, the cross, the X pattern, and, you know, you could do some pretty decent combos just knowing the patterns.
Like, it wasn't like Mortal Kombat, dude.
Like, Mortal Kombat 3, you really had to memorize combos in order to get through that game.
You know what I mean?
It was to the point where when I fired up Mortal Kombat 3 on Xbox last week, I still remembered a seven-hit cabal combo just because I had to memorize it like 10 years ago, you know?
Yeah, for Mortal Kombat 3, I'll agree with that because I've only memorized one character, and that was Sindel.
Dude, Sindel was awesome.
Yes, it was like low kick, low kick, high punch, high punch, uppercut.
Yeah, I used to know all the stuff for Sindel too.
She was awesome.
Yeah, and that was the only count I played, and I was like, eh, whatever.
They had some really dopey fatalities in Mortal Kombat 3, though.
Like, wasn't one of her fatalities where, like, she whips them in her, like, she literally whips her hair back and forth.
Like, she whips them up in a little, like, ice cream cone looking thing and then whips her hair back and it just, it unravels the body and all the bones go flying.
Like, it's really stupid.
Like, Mortal Kombat 3 was when it got really cartoony, you know what I mean?
Yeah, especially when her second one was when she screamed and your skin just came off.
I was like, okay.
yeah but there's also the thing also was that this came out also the same time around as the Virtua Fighter series was coming out and Virtua Fighter what I loved about that over things like Killer Instinct even Street Fighter was it just felt more natural to play like it just everything felt better at the time you know like I really felt like I was actually for a time I felt like oh wow my moves actually carried out it made sense not just memorizing combos and x y z magic pattern whatever right you know
and that's why I kind of had a really big dislike for it.
That and I got into a fist fight over some jackass in my college who was a whole stupid argument about it and I ended up punching him.
You got into a fist fight over this?
Yeah, because he was like, yeah, I remember also that this kid was acting all bullshit gangster.
In other words, he had it coming.
I was like, shut up and back and forth and I just like punched him and walked away.
Wow, have you ever gotten in a physical altercation over a video game?
DarkSakura, have you ever punched some bitch over a video game?
I punched my brother.
Did you really?
Yeah, because we were playing Super Street Fighter 4.
Not 4, why am I saying 4?
Super Street Fighter 2.
When my brothers were still, you know, younger.
And he totally, totally, totally tried to grab my controller, so I punched him.
Wow.
Oh, damn.
Well, you know, it's the bitch let go of my controller.
But you've never punched another girl over a video game?
I didn't know any other girls that played.
And then, you know, hit them with pillows and then rubbed your boobies together.
No, I always played with dudes.
Okay.
But I'd punch them, too.
And they thought it was funny.
I've always thought my coworkers are going to do that to me during Grand Theft Auto because I really piss them off when I play with them.
But, no.
Yeah, I don't think I've ever gotten into physical altercation over a video game.
Like, I think, you know, I've thrown controllers and I've probably thrown controllers at people.
DarkSakura.com
Okay.
So did I. Don't feel bad.
Sorry, I think we got off track a little bit, DDR Dollar Bill.
Somehow we went to fist fight to condensation on the windows.
That's okay.
It's all right.
And then the second thing also what got me, what I also want to talk about was that you were talking about your love of Commodore 64 games.
Yes.
That actually what got me started into emulation because I never actually played a Commodore until they actually started emulating the games, you know, I'd say in the mid-90s.
Mm-hmm.
and that's when I really started getting into it and the strangest thing was I actually was collecting magazines from England about Commodore games well because the Commodore 64 was huge over there I mean I would like to think it was pretty big in the US but it was huge in the UK huge
Oh, definitely.
The two magazines were The Games Machine and Zap64.
And it was through those magazines that I actually downloaded a few games.
And that's when I found two of my all-time favorite freaking soundtracks, as you were saying.
You said Dragon Slayer Escape from the Ninja Slave was a good soundtrack, and I'm agreeing with that one.
It was really cool.
What else, though?
My favorite all-time?
Last Ninja 2.
Dude, the last Ninja, those were some awesome games.
Yeah, absolutely.
The second one though, the music was just, oh my god, phenomenal.
Let's see if we can get some of the music here from this game.
I don't know if we, this is some gameplay video, so I don't know how much, I can't remember how much soundtrack was in the actual game.
Let's see if we can get to here.
The first one was my favorite, Central Park, the first level.
That was really good.
Trying to play some of the music here from it.
No, this thing's like muted or something.
Boring.
Well, there's Amiga.
Let's see this Amiga version here.
Let's see.
Yeah, that's the Amiga version.
Hold on.
Let me see if we have the Commodore 64 one.
Commodore 64 Long Play Part 1.
Here we go.
Ah, yes.
This is what I remember too.
Let's fast forward a little bit.
There's like a whole cinematic opening.
Oh, this is The Last Ninja 3.
My bad.
Oh, I would try it to be, actually.
I would try 1 and 2.
Usagi Yojimbo
Oh, this is the rabbit samurai thing.
Yeah, Usagi Yojimbo.
Oh, got it.
There you go.
Alright, very cool.
Yeah.
People are still using Commodore 64s to make music.
It's awesome.
I know, and it's like, when you think about the way, the fact that it has about, it's supposedly about the same hardware, I'm going to say, as Nintendo, but they did a lot more with the music.
It just blows my mind apart.
Absolutely.
Alright, well, DDR Dollar Bill, we're going to let you go to try to take at least one more call here, but have a good one, okay, buddy?
You too, thanks a lot, guys.
Alright, thanks for the reminiscing of the Commodore 64 classics, and don't get into any more fistfights over a game.
I'll try not to.
Alright, later.
Wow.
You know, I believe that kids fought over video games a long time ago, but I don't remember.
I played a lot of Street Fighter in the arcade, but I don't remember ever getting in a fistfight over it.
I remember a lot of trash-talking.
Any other last-minute stories that we got going on tonight?
No.
Oh, shit.
Uh-oh.
Huh?
I'm out of things to talk about.
Call us, people, damn it!
Well, it's a minute and a half delay.
So I posted it in chat, but it's going to take time before somebody gets through here.
We're going to need to have a list of things to talk about when the phones are dead or something.
Well, I've been doing a little bit of research, Rob, while we've been waiting for calls.
and if... Did we get a call?
Yes, we got a call.
So thank God.
We'll come back to your thought though after this.
Hi, you're on Orange Loss Radio.
Who's this?
Ziba.
Ziba.
How are you, my friend?
I'm doing good.
I heard you guys talk about Commodore 64 a lot.
I just wanted to give an update.
Of course we were because it's awesome.
Remember when I called, I think it was before Christmas or after Christmas or something, and I said I bought my boyfriend a Commodore 64?
Yes, yes, I do, because I remember telling you you were like the best girlfriend ever for doing that.
Yes, I do.
And then you guys told me I should look for something that will allow me to kind of use a flash card almost to play some games and do some stuff, but I actually did find something.
Oh, what'd you find?
It's called UIEC.
It's actually a, I guess this little SD card holder, and you actually hook it up to where the floppy drive hooks up to in the back of the Commodore, and...
And then you're actually able to put an SD card in it and save just like a floppy drive.
Oh my god, that sounds awesome.
And it actually comes with its own firmware and all this stuff.
And you can go online and get the hacked ROMs or whatever, the games, and you actually can put it on there and play them.
It's really hard to find ones that actually work.
Like you said, the Commodore 64 was really big in the UK and all those places in Europe.
Because it still is.
It still is?
I believe it.
There's actually conventions in Europe.
There's a lot of demo scenes.
Now, people are still coding on this thing and making their own little demo scenes.
And some people do some really awesome stuff.
And I've been trying to download some and play them, because you can do that too, but you can't play PAL demo scenes on US Commodore.
I'm actually thinking about getting a PAL Commodore 64 just so I can play games in the right speed because you can still play PAL games, but they play really fast because of the hertz difference and stuff, whatever.
Cybernoid 2
I remember Cybernoid.
They made an NES port of the original one, and it's not as good as the Commodore 64 one, to be honest.
I really like the music and just, you know, shooting little, like, I don't even know what the monsters are called because they're just like these little, I don't know, blobs.
But it's really fun.
I really like it.
Let's see.
I got a little bit of the gameplay here of Cybernoid 2.
This game was hard, too.
but there's lots of cheats that it came with so I still play with it but it's really fun.
you know why the Commodore 64 was so awesome is because it was a little bit ahead of its time in the fact that you could hook it up to a TV and so a lot of you didn't have to buy a separate monitor for it and I think that was part of what really drove it is that it was kind of like a gaming console computer I mean oh god whenever I think of the 80s I think of my Commodore 64 and just like having that made me the nerd I am it really did
We actually did have a hard time hooking up to TVs in here.
First, I was trying to use a Nintendo RF adapter, which didn't work very well.
So then I went online and I bought some cables and it worked, but it was all black and white.
So I was going crazy trying to find something.
Finally I went to Radio Shack and I got this adapter.
This little small adapter that allowed me to put a cable wire in it and then hook it up to the TV that way.
But even I was reading online people were having lots of troubles even putting it on a LCD TV because of the difference.
Oh sure.
Yeah, since the TVs are new.
Oh sure, I bet.
You know, and the old, from what I remember, I actually had a Commodore 64 monitor.
And what I remember of those cables, they were a little different because there were two video cable inputs and one audio.
And most RCA, the red, yellow, white, are two audio and one video.
And I think that's why a lot of people get black and white when they try to hook it up, is because of that.
So, yeah.
But I guess, I'm sure with this still being popular to develop today, people are figuring it out, you know?
So.
Alright.
Alright, well, thank you so much for the call, Ziba.
Is there anything else you want to get out there before we let you go so we can get more calls?
No, that's it.
Alright, take care, my friend.
You too.
Alright, bye-bye.
Bye.
I guess we'll let there be one more call here before we wrap things up.
Posted it to chat again to see if that will work.
Meanwhile, while we wait for that to come in, DarkSakura, what were we talking about a minute ago?
Oh, your project.
Yeah, I'm actually looking into logic board replacement.
Really?
Yeah, because you can't replace the processor because it's soldered into the logic board.
But you can replace the logic board with the processor on it.
So I'm actually now... My goal is to still get the OSX working and everything.
But this is actually turning out to be a little bit more fun than I thought it was going to be.
Because I can actually get a new logic board for about $100.
All right.
Let's go to the phones.
We have another call coming in.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
Hey, guys.
Hey.
This is DDR Angel, isn't it?
Hi.
Hi, guys.
Holy moly.
I haven't heard from you in forever.
Well, I mean, I've seen you on Twitter and all that stuff, Facebook and all that.
But I mean, having you on OLR, this is like old school.
I remember I wasn't the first episode you ever came to of OLR episode 20.
I think it was.
Something like that.
It was when OLR expanded from a two-hour show to a three-hour show officially.
I remember that.
Actually, it was when you were in that big house.
I don't remember.
That was like 2003 or something.
It was a long time ago.
I think we've had like seven different studios since then.
Yeah, that was when I lived with a guy named Brian.
That was many years ago.
Ten years ago.
Crazy stuff.
I just called because the Skype line was open.
I didn't really have anything I wanted to say.
Well, you're lucky.
It's funny because now that people realize it's open, we're getting hammered with like five people all at once.
And I feel bad because some people can't get through, but we'll see.
Well, DDR Angel, I know you didn't have a whole lot.
You just want to kind of say hi, but you know...
For those that are new to OLR, believe it or not, we're still here, as you can hear, and we have a lot of people that we've picked up since the podcasting era.
When we switched to podcasting, we gained a whole lot of new listeners because you didn't have to be here live Sunday every week to listen.
But since I know you've been listening to tonight's show, what's kind of different about OLR than the way it used to be?
Um, well, to me, there's a lot of old stuff that's still there.
So, you know, the main part of the show is still there.
And I didn't see too much of a difference.
But I mean, you guys do have, you know, a lot of other segments and stuff that you add in.
So it's just old LR are still being there.
But, you know, you've got your new segments, too, which I like.
So it's all good.
I mean, I don't know.
Awesome.
Well, anything anything else about the olden OLR days you want to enlighten these new kids with?
Um, cake pie.
No, wait, you guys already did that.
We were joking about all that old stuff earlier.
Yeah.
So now for those for those that are kind of catching up on lost time, you know, you you used to come to the show as a guest quite often.
Now you you I remember you used to play a game called here.
Was that what it was called?
Oh, there.
There.
Yeah.
Close.
Are you still... Close, very close.
Are you still involved?
They shut down.
Yeah, they had to shut down, right.
I remember that.
So sadly you're not... But you were with them right up until the very end, right?
Yes.
Awesome.
Gotcha, gotcha.
And I believe you got married since the last time you were here?
Yeah, I did, actually.
Somebody from the Belwani community a long time ago that used to come into the chat room by the name of...
Ohio BRP Balani or whatever.
Yeah.
I don't remember his name actually.
Big Red Pimp?
Yes, Big Red Pimp.
There you go.
So you guys actually ended up getting married?
Yep.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
Are you still here in California?
You moved out to Ohio, didn't you?
No, I didn't.
No, I'm still in California.
No, he moved here.
I'm in Sonoma County, actually.
Oh, you're still there.
Yeah, I'm still here.
You can come by anytime, guys.
I might have to.
That's awesome.
I thought for some reason you went to Ohio for a bit.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
He's just from here.
He moved here.
Oh, okay.
Got it.
See, I'm a little bit behind on the times, too.
No, it's all good.
All right, but you have a blog.
I know you have a blog.
I do, but it has nothing to do with gaming.
That's all right.
Why don't you go ahead and pimp your blog, and I'll try to get one more call.
Sure, you guys can check it out at TheEcoMaker.com I can type it in the chat room so that you guys can put it on the site or the notes or whatever you want to do And what will people find at TheEcoMaker.com?
Pretty much anything to do with making your own cleaning products to making dinner for dinner ideas and such too It's a very homely site
Yes, yes it is But it also saves you money as well so it kind of works out Welcome back and I'm really glad you decided to stop by tonight It's always nice to see Blast from the Past Hopefully I can check out a show at some point I don't know, we'll have to talk about that Awesome Alright, well you take care and all the best to the hubby as well and you guys take care Definitely, you guys take care too Bye That was nice to hear from Blast from the Past We've been doing this show a long fucking time you know that?
Yeah, a long time.
But hey, we're going to make it to 10.
You know what?
What the hell?
One more call.
Why not?
We had a short news segment tonight.
We'll open up one more time.
Just because our phones were getting slammed there a minute ago.
So we'll open it up one more time for you guys.
1-877-GAME-OLR or use your name on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
The phone lines are open.
But of course this means while I wait for the little delay there, I have to think of another banter topic with Dark Sakura.
I'm nearly... I'm excited, Rob.
How so?
With your project?
Yeah.
Thank you for making this possible.
You're welcome.
Well, I was just collecting dust at your place anyway.
Yeah, it's true.
No, the old laptop.
You know, it's amazing the stuff I'm finding while I'm going through and unpacking things.
I found an old picture of you... Of me.
...and Melody taping an episode of Under Sedation Live in Travis's old backyard.
Oh...
An old, old picture.
Yeah, it was you, me, and Melody all huddled together looking cute.
I remember this, too.
Travis did a backyard episode of Understation Live.
I don't remember what the shtick was.
You'll have to bring it over.
There's always some shtick with Travis.
I love him, but there's always some shtick.
And this was the backyard episode shtick.
Oh, yeah, I found that.
I found one of all of us on a DDR machine.
It was me, you, Irene, the guy Irene was dating at the time.
So she probably don't want to see that picture.
Who else was in it?
I think one other person was all in the picture.
Maybe Brad?
Oh, Bradley?
No.
Not Bradley.
Brad.
Yeah, I think he's in it, hence the crazy person that I read.
Yeah, I don't know.
I don't know.
I remember what else.
Somebody else, I think, was in that picture.
He was our mighty Mormon Power Ranger.
Let's see.
What else did I find when I was moving?
Let me know if you find the install disks.
For what?
The laptop?
Yeah.
I doubt I'll find that.
You know I'm being silly.
I know.
I want to see the old pictures.
I will find those pictures and I will get them to you.
Alright, finally the calls are coming in.
The delay caught up.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
I made it in.
Wow, you guys are like trying to call Britney Spears on a Friday night or something.
It's great.
It feels special.
This is Derek H. Derek from Virginia Beach, Virginia.
Derek, how are you?
Of course I recognize your voice the minute I picked up.
How are you, my friend?
Eh, you know, this and that.
The important thing is, the Commodore 64, I had one, I loved it.
I started with a VIC-20, went all the way up to an Amiga 1200, 030-6060, for those in the know.
I'm sorry, 030-4040.
You stuck with Commodore for a very long time, because the Amigas were like the last big hurrahs for them.
Yeah, that was sad, because...
If you had an Amiga, you were the type of person that believed, and I mean, you believed that one day...
Everybody else would wake up and everybody would be using Amigas and you would be vindicated for all your years of... Yeah, that never happened.
Amigas were kind of the Macs of their time, which is ironic because Macs were out at the same time.
But you know how people pay the premiums for the Apple products these days?
Amiga was kind of like that back in the day, in a way.
You know what has happened to Mac?
That's what Amiga people thought were going to happen for Amiga.
And it's just...
Oh, it had it all.
If only they had cellular phones when Commodore was big.
Maybe, maybe they could have been the ones to think of at first.
That Amiga was so great.
But the Converse before, I guess, is what we're talking about.
But the Amiga was kick-ass.
You say you were thinking about going to get one?
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, don't do that.
Why?
Are they all in terrible shape?
Stick with the emulation because...
Once you get one, it's like all of a sudden everything rushes back to you.
Except it rushes back to you in present day because computers now are literally 2,000 to 3,000 times faster than the Converse 64.
That's not even an exaggeration.
DarkSakura,
and it's uh games they don't play like you think they're gonna play right but they don't because back then the lag was you expected the lag you expected things not when you move the joystick you expected a half second or second thing before something moved on the screen nowadays if that happens you're like what the what the hell is wrong with this thing what's wrong and
And then you'll fall out of love with the Comma Murderer.
Remember the Comma Murderer 64 as it is.
As it was, not as it is.
This happens a lot in gaming.
You know, things are better through those retro-colored glasses.
Or, you know, they say the rose-colored glasses.
But the retro-colored glasses, sometimes I think we remember gaming better that way.
And I just mentioned this earlier in the show.
The X-Men arcade game that's on Xbox Live.
Elite Elite Elite is...
and insanely good.
And for what they stuck on that 64K and that floppy disk, which I think held, what, 100, like 150K or something, some stupid low number.
It had more worlds on Elite than Mass Effect 1, Mass Effect 2, all of the Wing Commanders combined.
You got Jamie's husband, Dan, up from the couch to come in here to say and agree with you that Elite was awesome, just so you know.
All the stuff that people say you can do.
It's an open world.
If you want to do this, if you want to be a rogue, be a rogue.
Elite had that, except it was 25 years ago on a Commodore 64.
You can literally say, I'm going to spend the rest of my life just moving corn back and forth between these two planets.
Or I'm just going to be a policeman and hang out and just kill bad guys as they try to run.
Or you can be anything in that game before...
Thousands of years before Grand Theft Auto 4 came around or Star Wars, Galaxies, old school of the Jedi's thing.
You know, I think the Mass Effect comparison is a pretty good one with Elite.
I mean, because it was like a spacey, space game, right?
Yeah, you could pick your own ship.
You could outfit your ship.
They had shrivels in it.
It was...
I want to play the game, but I can't play it because it's on the friggin' Commodore 64 and it's gonna suck if I play it now.
You have to remember it how it was, Derek.
You have to remember it how it was.
The original SimCity was on the Commodore 64, and of course that game's blown up a million times over.
What were some other great Commodore 64 games?
I remember Spy vs. Spy was one of my favorites.
Little Computer People is The Sims.
of course, Video Games Computer Entertainment had a little thing I would sit there and type it in and here's the sad part I did not get a
for you for once again for people I did not get a break of 1541 for for like a year because we were poor and I still think my mom's I now I don't know how she got me that commerce before because we were poor and she got me one so I thank her every day for getting me started on this but it took me it took her a while before I got to 1541 so I would sit there and type those programs in and tell everybody not to come near my computer and I'll put a pillow over
over top of it and hide it so nobody would turn it off because once you turn it off, it's gone.
There's no flash RAM saving stuff.
You didn't have a drive to save on?
Save.
And plus, when I first got it, I typed load and load didn't work.
You had to type load, comma, eight, comma, one.
Yep.
DarkSakura.com
Yeah, it taught me not to believe in miracles.
Speaking of believing in miracles, I have to ask this.
Obviously, a lot of people on the All Games Network know you from your show, Dead Pixel Live.
I know you're on a little bit of a siesta right now, enjoying your Mai Tais on the beach while you're taking a break from Dead Pixel Live.
But any chance of a re-revival?
All I can say now is that Dead Pigs Alive is currently on hiatus.
I have found out, as you guys may or may not know, I'm sure you do know, this thing kind of fills a hole in your life.
And without it, all of a sudden you realize, I miss a lot of... I kind of want to do my show again, but I guess maybe I should get out more.
But I really want to do my show.
It's good that it was there.
I really don't know what I'd do with my Sunday nights without OLR.
I'd probably be watching Desperate Housewives, and that's just sad.
I know what I would do.
I would play more Dragon Age 2.
For now, but... Then you'd be like, I want to tell somebody about Dragon Age 2.
I remember when I had a show and it was a lot of fun.
Actually, I'd probably just do another show.
Listen to how she is.
I would just do a show without you guys.
No.
I see how it is.
I couldn't do it without you guys.
Maybe with Tiara.
Derek, best of luck in whatever it is you do.
Thanks so much for the call and taking a trip down memory lane with us.
Hey, Amiga forever.
That's right.
Take care, buddy.
That's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
Those were some good calls.
See, it was worth waiting for.
Designing a free running course is hard
My final thought is I still have kitchenware to pack.
Joy.
DarkSakura, your final thought?
I wonder what my hair was like in that picture.
Was it long?
I think so.
Was it when I had long, really kind of crappy, bushy hair that was five different shades of red?
Yes.
Yeah.
Good times.
I'm glad I have much better hair these days.
