8000	10000	DarkSakura
10000	12000	Sky and Lowkey
14000	16000	Tonight, April 24th, 2011
16000	19000	Is EA Sports set to roll out a new paid subscription service?
19000	22000	Child of Eden is delayed on one platform
22000	26000	And could an upcoming paid demo determine the fate of Mega Man Legends 3?
26000	29000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	33000	Hello my friends out there on the internet
33000	36000	And welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio
36000	39000	It's the show where every gamer has a voice
39000	41000	We tape live at All Games Radio
41000	43000	www.allgames.com
43000	46000	Every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern
46000	48000	Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show
48000	49000	My name is Rob Roberts
49000	52000	I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-hosts
52000	53000	First up, the one and only
53000	55000	DarkSakura, Jamie Summers
55000	56000	Hi
56000	57000	How are you?
57000	59000	Feeling far better than I did previously
59000	60000	Yes
60000	61000	I can eat now
61000	63000	I'm sorry to hear you were sick and all
63000	64000	What happened?
64000	65000	You just had a
65000	66000	No idea, I think it was just a bug
66000	67000	That's too bad
67000	69000	It had to have been a virus because nobody else got sick
69000	71000	Do you feel refreshed after a week off?
71000	73000	We weren't here last week
73000	76000	And you were really the only one that didn't have anything going
76000	78000	Well, I don't know if you ended up doing something else
78000	80000	But Lowkey's my fault
80000	82000	I got to spend a good night with my boy
82000	83000	Good, good
83000	84000	Little date night
84000	86000	More of a hanging out
86000	87000	How cute
87000	90000	Hey, I think we actually played some more Final Fantasy that night
90000	93000	Oh, your little Final Fantasy megathon or whatever you're doing?
93000	94000	Yeah, whenever we get back to it
94000	97000	We got the level up, the job change
97000	98000	Okay, there you go
98000	100000	Oh, so you're still on one
100000	102000	But you're now probably what, halfway through one
102000	104000	Because that's about the halfway point of the game
104000	105000	Little more maybe
105000	106000	Yeah, cool, cool
106000	108000	Well, I'm not here tonight sadly
108000	110000	Techmaster Lowkey is not here
110000	112000	I don't know, there's something about like
112000	114000	Baby's first Easter
114000	116000	And all this like, I gotta do family stuff
116000	118000	Like, whatever, nice excuse
118000	120000	Alright, no, just kidding, obviously
120000	121000	Understandable
121000	123000	I can't wait until next year when they're all like
123000	125000	We've done all this, who cares
125000	127000	So sadly Lowkey is not here tonight
127000	129000	But filling in for Techmaster Lowkey
129000	130000	Say hello to Salacious Pop
130000	131000	Hello
131000	132000	How are you?
132000	133000	I'm great
133000	135000	Thank you for coming here on kind of a short notice
135000	136000	So, appreciate it
136000	137000	No, I live with you now
137000	139000	So you can just drag me out wherever
139000	141000	Exactly, it's pretty easy
141000	143000	I have to be honest, Salacious Pop
143000	145000	It wasn't the first person I tried to get on here
145000	147000	I know that sounds really horrible
147000	149000	It's not, obviously he's a wonderful guest and so forth
149000	151000	But it's kind of like, you know, you try to bring on
151000	152000	A variety of folks
152000	154000	And unfortunately everybody else I asked
154000	155000	Was like, ah, Easter
155000	157000	And I got Easter stuff going on
157000	158000	Yeah, there's Easter things
158000	160000	It's like a big holiday or something
160000	162000	No, I guess it is for a lot of people
162000	164000	But I always thought Easter was kind of done in the morning
164000	166000	Like, I finished Easter stuff in the morning today
166000	167000	I had family stuff going on
167000	169000	But that was all in the morning, so
169000	170000	I don't know
170000	172000	Well, I mean, I think the real Easter experience is
172000	174000	You get up and you go to church
174000	176000	So, if you're not going to mass, then
176000	177000	Yeah, but
177000	178000	You can make it up as you go along
178000	180000	Mass is like at midnight or something, right?
180000	182000	So, you got plenty of time for OLR still, right?
182000	183000	No, I don't know
183000	184000	Alright, forget it
184000	187000	I'll quit being a heathen or whatever
187000	189000	Anyway, let's introduce the chat room
189000	190000	They're always there
190000	193000	Because really, Jesus died so you could have chocolate
193000	195000	chat.orangelaungeradio.com
195000	196000	Marshmallow Peeps
196000	197000	Eww
197000	200000	A chat.orangelaungeradio.com
200000	202000	You can chat live with us
202000	204000	here on tonight's program
204000	206000	And get your little piece in
206000	208000	Whatever it is you want to say and so forth
208000	210000	We do have a handful of people in chat
210000	211000	Despite the holiday
211000	213000	Of course, it's a little less than usual
213000	215000	And in part, you can blame a week off
215000	217000	Because, I'll tell you what
217000	219000	Hoard House inadvertently had a week off as well
219000	220000	And I'll tell you what, died
220000	221000	Forums died
221000	223000	It's like, if you do a podcast
223000	224000	I'll tell you what, here's the advice
224000	226000	Because we get emails once in a while
226000	228000	You know, how have you guys stuck with doing a podcast
228000	229000	For nine years to today?
229000	230000	Do you have any advice?
230000	231000	You have my advice?
231000	232000	Try never to take weeks off
232000	234000	Unless you absolutely have to
234000	237000	Because, unfortunately, folks will get out of the habit of listening to you
237000	239000	And it's over like that
239000	241000	Alright, anyhow, we're back
241000	244000	Hopefully you will find room for us
244000	246000	In your podcasting and listening schedule again
246000	248000	And we want to talk about video games
248000	249000	Gaming news
249000	251000	We'll start it off as we always do with our gaming week
251000	253000	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
253000	255000	I played a bunch of stuff
255000	257000	Well, I played a lot of World of Warcraft
257000	260000	And two new games appeared in my steam account today
260000	262000	The Star Trek DAC
262000	264000	And Darwinia
264000	266000	Which I have installed
266000	268000	Just have not played
268000	270000	Because I had an epic nap today
270000	271000	How could that have happened?
271000	272000	I don't know, Rob
272000	275000	Some Sky person sent it to me
275000	279000	And we had our Final Fantasy go on
279000	282000	It's not like you had a birthday or anything happen during the hiatus
282000	284000	By the way, happy birthday
284000	285000	Thank you
285000	286000	Old lady
286000	287000	Not old lady
287000	288000	Just kidding
288000	290000	I still got it
290000	293000	Well, Tuesday we went to Dave and Buster's for my birthday
293000	294000	Thank you guys for coming
294000	295000	You're welcome
295000	297000	And I had a purple people eater
297000	299000	Which I kind of regretted having
299000	302000	Because that was when my stomach was starting to get really bad
302000	305000	But, um, we, uh
305000	308000	I played some Derby Owners Club
308000	310000	And Tank Tank Tank
310000	313000	And some of that really awesome Terminator gun game
313000	315000	And this weird trivia game
315000	317000	That I really didn't know much of the answers to
317000	319000	Because it was like sports
319000	321000	And pop culture
321000	323000	Like, the type of pop culture that I don't keep up with
323000	325000	And, uh
325000	327000	What else did I play?
327000	329000	Because I played other stuff
329000	330000	I played Droplets
330000	333000	When I had my big bad insomnia attack last night
333000	337000	Except all it really did was make me have to pee
337000	339000	And, uh
339000	342000	Some, uh, Luminesse
342000	344000	And, uh
344000	346000	What else did I play?
346000	347000	I played something else
347000	349000	Oh, yeah, um, Peggle Extreme
349000	352000	And then watched an entire playthrough of Portal 2
352000	354000	You actually watched the whole thing start to finish, huh?
354000	355000	Yes, I did
355000	356000	Wow
356000	358000	See, I didn't want to ruin it for myself
358000	360000	I did that with the last one, too
360000	361000	Did you really?
361000	363000	That means now I'll have some idea
363000	365000	So how to play a little bit more seamlessly
365000	367000	So that I do not get too motion sick
367000	372000	So, um, do you find that if you kind of play the YouTubes in advance or whatever
372000	375000	That it helps the experience or hurts it?
375000	376000	I think it helps it
376000	378000	I've been trying very hard to dodge spoilers
378000	380000	I have not beaten Portal 2 yet
380000	382000	And I'm really, like, everybody's like
382000	383000	You gotta hear the song
383000	385000	I'm like, doesn't the song have spoilers?
385000	386000	So
386000	387000	Not really
387000	390000	I mean, yeah, it does really give away the ending
390000	392000	But I'm trying really hard to avoid all that, so
392000	393000	You know
393000	394000	Yeah
394000	396000	But I love it
396000	399000	My favorite thing so far is
399000	401000	BIRD KILL IT
401000	405000	So, uh, do you know that it's Noble Garden Week in WoW?
405000	407000	Because you played some WoW, it's Easter
407000	408000	Oh
408000	409000	It's Easter holiday, it's one of the easier ones
409000	411000	I didn't do that, I'll have to do it this week
411000	412000	It's all this week, it just started today
412000	413000	Okay
413000	415000	It's Rob's favorite holiday
415000	416000	Ugh
416000	418000	No, my favorite holiday is coming up next week in WoW
418000	419000	It's Children's Week
419000	421000	And my favorite, I mean, ugh
421000	423000	It's terrible
423000	425000	And it's the one holiday I need for my Violet Drake
425000	427000	Because literally last year I said
427000	430000	Fuck Children's Week, I'm not putting up with this bullshit
430000	431000	Ugh, you gotta do it
431000	433000	And I had to wait an entire year
433000	434000	Anyhow
434000	435000	Well, let's
435000	438000	I found, by the way, a dragon that I want
438000	441000	That's blue and has transparent wings, looks kind of aquatic
441000	443000	It might be one of those hard to get ones
443000	445000	I know, but I want it
445000	446000	Alright
446000	447000	It will be mine
447000	449000	Let's move on with some other video games
449000	451000	Salacious Pop, what'd you play this week?
451000	457000	I've actually played a lot, considering that usually my schedule is simply WoW
457000	459000	Which I'm playing far less of
459000	461000	I played some Toki Tori
461000	465000	Because it was a part of the Steam Potato Bag special
465000	467000	I had already owned Toki Tori
467000	470000	So they just patched in the Potato Portal 2 content
470000	473000	Because I wanted to try and unlock Portal 2 early
473000	476000	Even though I didn't really have the means to buy it
476000	478000	I still haven't really played Portal 2 yet
478000	480000	So Toki Tori Mortal Kombat
480000	482000	Beat the story mode
482000	489000	And did some just regular one person versus PC fighting on that
489000	492000	And some Smash TV
492000	494000	Some Fatal
494000	496000	Going old school, what made you do Smash TV?
496000	498000	Just when we were
498000	501000	I was putting my Xbox Live account on your Xbox
501000	504000	And was trying to sync up all the games that you have on it
504000	506000	So I was just going through some old stuff on there
506000	512000	And yeah, that's it really
512000	515000	What did you think of Mortal Kombat?
515000	517000	I wish the story mode was longer
517000	521000	Because all the endless fighting
521000	523000	If there's even just a little bit of dialogue in between
523000	525000	It'll hold my attention more
525000	527000	Than just doing ladder mode
527000	529000	And getting up to the boss
529000	531000	And starting all over from scratch
531000	532000	But yeah, I liked it
532000	534000	I found a lot of bugs in it
534000	536000	Audio bugs
536000	538000	That hopefully they'll be able to patch and fix
538000	542000	Once a certain system is back online
542000	544000	Which we'll get into I'm sure in a minute
544000	546000	But yeah, it's fun
546000	548000	It's a good
548000	550000	They pretty much looked at what Street Fighter 4 did
550000	552000	And it's like, oh that's awesome
552000	554000	We should do that for our franchise
554000	556000	And it's working for them
556000	559000	It doesn't hurt that they've had a little bit of a break
559000	561000	With Midway having gone under
561000	563000	And somebody else had to pick up the series
563000	566000	So it kind of gave them a little time to think about how to reinvent
566000	568000	Yeah, I think Warner Brothers
568000	570000	I know Warner Brothers published it
570000	573000	Well the Mortal Kombat folks I think broke off
573000	575000	And made this NetherRealm Studios
575000	577000	Is their new little thing
577000	579000	And then Warner Brothers is their publisher
579000	581000	So you know, Mortal Kombat's
581000	583000	Been a viable enough franchise
583000	586000	I don't know how well the last few games in the series have sold
586000	588000	Keep in mind the last game that came out
588000	590000	Was the Mortal Kombat in DC Universe game
590000	592000	I don't know how well that sold
592000	594000	But before that they were
594000	596000	Cranking them out
596000	598000	I think those games have always sold enough
598000	600000	I don't know if they've ever sold big
600000	602000	And it really seems like they're trying to get this new one
602000	604000	In the series to sell big
604000	606000	Because we had what?
606000	608000	We had Deadly Alliance
608000	610000	We had Annihilation
610000	612000	There was another one in the middle there
612000	614000	The one that had the Mortal Kombat mini racing
614000	616000	Kart game was there too
616000	618000	Annihilation was the one that had
618000	620000	Literally everybody
620000	622000	That was kind of the last Mortal Kombat game
622000	624000	But then they're like, oh
624000	626000	How do you save a franchise? You do a reboot
626000	628000	And you know, that's literally what they've done
628000	630000	Literally, like that's the story
630000	632000	Is built around a reboot
632000	634000	Yeah, the story mode
634000	636000	If you play it from start to finish
636000	638000	Does the canon
638000	640000	The official canon of the first three games
640000	642000	And it sets you up for what
642000	644000	Mortal Kombat 4 was, lore wise
644000	646000	At the end of the story mode
646000	648000	Let's go to our chatroom
648000	650000	At chat.orangesonstrader.com for some comments
650000	652000	Tigerclaw in our chatroom says
652000	654000	The MK story mode is long if you take into account
654000	656000	How difficult it was to beat Shao Kahn
656000	658000	The best strategy was to
658000	660000	Teleport, uppercut, repeat that and stay
660000	662000	Far away until time expires
662000	664000	Yeah, I did some lightning ball cheese on him
664000	666000	Just get away, pew pew
666000	668000	I'm gonna pew pew at you
668000	670000	And then he just hopefully doesn't block enough of him to win
670000	672000	Because the thing about story mode is that you have
672000	674000	To play as pretty much every character
674000	676000	Or do you play every character?
676000	678000	Only the human side really
678000	680000	You don't play the outworld
680000	682000	And netherworld people
682000	684000	But you still have to play a pretty good mix of people
684000	686000	Yeah, Sonya, Jax
686000	688000	Most of Raiden's little groupies
688000	690000	Are who you control
690000	692000	And Tigerclaw in our chatroom also fills in here with
692000	694000	Rob, it's like what they did with Star Trek
694000	696000	Due to the events of the beginning
696000	698000	It creates an alternate timeline
698000	700000	I don't think that's very spoilery
700000	702000	I think that's pretty common knowledge
702000	704000	In story mode, I believe people die
704000	706000	I haven't gotten that far in my story mode
706000	708000	But I believe people do die
708000	710000	I don't want to spoil that for you
710000	712000	But there's big twists and events
712000	716000	I believe characters become characters that didn't exist before
716000	718000	Kind of interesting
718000	720000	Back in the 90s when MK2 and MK3 were out
720000	722000	Baraka wasn't in MK3
722000	724000	Because in the canon
724000	726000	He died at the end of 2
726000	728000	They don't show that and obviously you can still play as him
728000	730000	In this new reboot
730000	732000	So they left out some of the deaths
732000	734000	So the official canon is in there
734000	736000	That's cool
736000	738000	Going into my gaming week
738000	740000	Obviously I played Mortal Kombat
740000	742000	Pretty extensively this week as well
742000	744000	I do like how they have
744000	746000	Really brought a lot of the nostalgia
746000	748000	I think you commenting
748000	750000	What Street Fighter 2 did
750000	752000	We should do that
752000	754000	Or Street Fighter 4 did for Street Fighter 2
754000	756000	We should do that
756000	758000	Is almost exactly what they've done
758000	760000	A lot of that has the nostalgia of the different stages
760000	762000	And I really like how in story mode
762000	764000	The very first part of story mode
764000	766000	Takes place in a stage
766000	768000	That you see in the original Mortal Kombat
768000	770000	With Shang Tsung sitting up on the throne
770000	772000	And all the monks sitting in front of him
772000	774000	That applaud
774000	776000	They literally bring that to life
776000	778000	In this new Mortal Kombat game
778000	780000	And that's pretty cool to watch
780000	782000	That's something I don't really remember happening in Street Fighter
782000	784000	So kind of getting to see all that play out
784000	786000	With, I hate saying next gen graphics
786000	788000	But you know
788000	790000	Or ten years later technology
790000	792000	Updated
792000	794000	Graphics and effects is really cool
794000	796000	Kind of watch all that play out
796000	798000	Did you bring it?
798000	800000	I didn't bring it tonight
800000	802000	I'm sorry I didn't know you wanted to play it
802000	804000	I've been watching all of the fatalities
804000	806000	And the special unlock characters and everything
806000	808000	And I found out where all of the hidden coins are
808000	810000	Yeah there's a little guide online
810000	812000	That we use to get every costume
812000	814000	If you don't
814000	816000	Buy any of the extras
816000	818000	In the crypt and you just do story mode
818000	820000	From start to finish
820000	822000	You have 130,000
822000	824000	Of the MK coins
824000	826000	That's enough to get almost half of the goodies
826000	828000	It's enough to get all the costumes and the fatalities
828000	830000	That's cool because I think that there's like
830000	832000	Another hidden 20,000
832000	834000	Yeah
834000	836000	I'm being corrected by our chat room
836000	838000	Annihilation was the movie
838000	840000	Armageddon was the game
840000	842000	My bad, my bad, sorry guys
842000	844000	Thanks Spaznator
844000	846000	A comment from Randy in our chat room
846000	848000	I felt like the story mode cleared up the events of the franchise
848000	850000	It was definitely more confusing before
850000	852000	Yeah you know Mortal Kombat
852000	854000	Kind of always felt like one of those games
854000	856000	Where they had to kind of write the story
856000	858000	To fit what they wanted to do
858000	860000	And so there were all these weird things going on
860000	862000	But yeah I kind of agree
862000	864000	That what they've done with this little reboot
864000	866000	I mean granted although they're changing some things
866000	868000	It kind of makes a lot of stuff make more sense
868000	870000	All in all as far as for the game itself
870000	872000	And this is interesting because
872000	874000	When I did the demo a couple weeks ago
874000	876000	I think I expressed concern
876000	878000	Like I'm not sure I'm going to like this game
878000	880000	Well just goes to show
880000	882000	Don't ever base your opinion of a game off the demo
882000	884000	Don't ever ever ever do that
884000	886000	Because it was actually really good
886000	888000	And I've been having a good time with it
888000	890000	I think there's such a great variety in characters
890000	892000	That they've brought in
892000	894000	Pretty much every single fighter from 1, 2, and 3
894000	896000	Are in it right
896000	898000	With maybe some very minor like the boss characters
898000	900000	Not all of them are there
900000	902000	When I was going through the list I saw that
902000	904000	Kentaro, Goro
904000	906000	Shiva
906000	908000	I think they all show up in the story
908000	910000	But they had fatalities for him
910000	912000	Oh really?
912000	914000	The big centaur dude with the big horse
914000	916000	I think he was the boss of MK3
916000	918000	He's in it in a cutscene but you don't play as him
918000	920000	And then Quan Chi from before
920000	922000	Was brought in so he's playable
922000	924000	But otherwise the people from 4 aren't in it yet
924000	926000	Yeah although
926000	928000	DLC might change some of that
928000	930000	There's a character that was introduced in Deadly Alliance
930000	932000	Who's actually one of my favorite characters
932000	934000	Kenshi is one of the first download characters
934000	936000	The blind ninja guy
936000	938000	There's a lot of people calling for Tanya to show up
938000	940000	I would love Tanya to be in the game
940000	942000	She's awesome
942000	944000	She wasn't a major character though
944000	946000	She was a bitch
946000	948000	So I'm not expecting her to show up
948000	950000	But it would be cool if she would
950000	952000	And then I was watching the fatalities
952000	954000	For Kratos
954000	956000	Kratos is in the game
956000	958000	He obviously fits right in
958000	960000	I gotta say though
960000	962000	He plays like any other character
962000	964000	Which I think is a compliment
964000	966000	You don't want a character like Kratos
966000	968000	To be gimmicky or stick out like a sore thumb
968000	970000	But I mean the whole
970000	972000	Painting his body white and everything
972000	974000	Well Quan Chi does that shit too
974000	976000	So he kind of fits right in with everybody else
976000	978000	It's a better promotional exclusive thing
978000	980000	Than I don't know Darth Vader and Yoda
980000	982000	And Soul Calibur IV
982000	984000	And also the other thing
984000	986000	That
986000	988000	Who was it?
988000	990000	I just lost my train of thought
990000	992000	It was somebody else that's in there
992000	994000	Well Noob and
994000	996000	Ermac were
996000	998000	Fandom rumors
998000	1000000	That they actually made real characters
1000000	1002000	I love that
1002000	1004000	Ermac's fatality with the spikes
1004000	1006000	That one's really cool
1006000	1008000	Leo Shen is in our chat room saying
1008000	1010000	No Rain otherwise they would have all of Trilogy
1010000	1012000	Yeah Rain is one of the most notable
1012000	1014000	Notable characters that's missing but
1014000	1016000	To be honest because they've done so
1016000	1018000	Much with the other ninjas like
1018000	1020000	Cyrax and Sektor are not
1020000	1022000	Just palette swaps
1022000	1024000	They are fully developed
1024000	1026000	They start in story mode as humans
1026000	1028000	And you can unlock their human forms
1028000	1030000	So they are all very different characters
1030000	1032000	So I can see why they probably cut
1032000	1034000	Rain because while he was a cool
1034000	1036000	Character especially he was really
1036000	1038000	Tacked into Trilogy I think
1038000	1040000	He was purple Rain
1040000	1042000	He was a palette swap that had a couple cool moves
1042000	1044000	With a neat name
1044000	1046000	Otherwise he was really
1046000	1048000	Forced in the story
1048000	1050000	I would bet he's DLC later on though
1050000	1052000	I remember what I was going to say
1052000	1054000	One of Shang Tsung's fatalities was actually
1054000	1056000	His mortal combat
1056000	1058000	Versus DC fatality
1058000	1060000	Except it's the whole thing
1060000	1062000	Because they cut it to where you only see him
1062000	1064000	Turn into a clown
1064000	1066000	And then you don't see the other person explode
1066000	1068000	They showed the full fatality
1068000	1070000	Because people were like what happened
1070000	1072000	So they actually put that in there
1072000	1074000	The fatalities in this game are a little silly
1074000	1076000	As they're supposed to be very over the top
1076000	1078000	Babalities are in there
1078000	1080000	Babalities are cute
1080000	1082000	But friendships are not which kind of surprised me
1082000	1084000	I was very sad
1084000	1086000	No animalities or any of the other weird stuff either
1086000	1088000	I was really sad friendships weren't there
1088000	1090000	I always loved those in Mortal Combat 2
1090000	1092000	Otherwise the game is pretty fast paced
1092000	1094000	It's got a great tutorial mode
1094000	1096000	That kind of teaches you how to do things like
1096000	1098000	The x-ray attacks are a really neat addition
1098000	1100000	It does feel a little lifted
1100000	1102000	From Street Fighter 4
1102000	1104000	It's one of those things where it's like
1104000	1106000	It's not a copy
1106000	1108000	But it's definitely influenced
1108000	1110000	But it's really cool
1110000	1112000	It adds to the battle exactly what it does
1112000	1114000	In Street Fighter 4
1114000	1116000	If you are behind this gives you a chance to level the playing field
1116000	1118000	If your opponent has a moment of weakness
1118000	1120000	And the x-ray attacks look really cool
1120000	1122000	And it makes the battle flow really well
1122000	1124000	And I think that's where this game really shines
1124000	1126000	Is that just the battles
1126000	1128000	Flow so well
1128000	1130000	They're fun to play
1130000	1132000	The fatalities give that
1132000	1134000	Sense of edge to it
1134000	1136000	There's a lot at stake
1136000	1138000	Where this Mortal Combat
1138000	1140000	Really shines is where a lot of the
1140000	1142000	Prior Mortal Combat games have really shined
1142000	1144000	And that is the
1144000	1146000	Robustness of what is offered
1146000	1148000	In the title
1148000	1150000	You've got your story mode
1150000	1152000	You've got your challenge ladder
1152000	1154000	You've got the crypt thing
1154000	1156000	Which the crypt thing has been done better
1156000	1158000	In other versions of the game I think
1158000	1160000	But whatever it's still there
1160000	1162000	You have different modes to play
1162000	1164000	And the tag team thing
1164000	1166000	Kind of comes out of nowhere too
1166000	1168000	They kind of took that whole idea
1168000	1170000	I guess you could say Marvel vs Capcom or whatever
1170000	1172000	But now you have teams of two
1172000	1174000	And you can do assists and all that stuff
1174000	1176000	So it's pretty cool
1176000	1178000	Mortal Combat has really been invigorated
1178000	1180000	It's been infused with some of the best parts
1180000	1182000	For a pretty awesome experience
1182000	1184000	One of my favorite Mortal Combat games in recent memory
1184000	1186000	The best one of all time
1186000	1188000	I think that's still two
1188000	1190000	It's one of those that
1190000	1192000	That's going to be hard to top
1192000	1194000	It's worth
1194000	1196000	Checking out if nothing else
1196000	1198000	A lot of people like to point and laugh at Mortal Combat
1198000	1200000	In the fighting world
1200000	1202000	But I think this one shows that there's a lot here to take seriously
1202000	1204000	Two Beta was great
1204000	1206000	With Katana's infinite combo
1206000	1210000	Let's see
1210000	1212000	Tigerclaw in our chatroom says
1212000	1214000	Rob regarding animalities at least one of them is in there
1214000	1216000	It's one of Liu Kang's fatalities
1216000	1218000	That's true
1218000	1220000	But wasn't it also a fatality in Mortal Combat 2
1220000	1222000	I think that's what inspired it
1222000	1224000	Not necessarily the animalities
1224000	1226000	Anyhow, other games I played this week
1226000	1228000	I don't want to talk just about Mortal Combat
1228000	1230000	Because I haven't had a chance to play Mortal Combat online
1230000	1232000	Because of certain outages
1232000	1236000	But I have had a chance to check out Portal 2
1236000	1238000	Portal 2 is
1238000	1240000	I played the first game
1240000	1242000	And played that game pretty extensively
1242000	1244000	And it was always a pretty cool concept
1244000	1246000	And when I heard they were making a sequel
1246000	1248000	I knew it was going to be pretty interesting
1248000	1250000	And I've been playing through the single player mode
1250000	1254000	And I really don't know what to say
1254000	1256000	I honestly think
1256000	1258000	Games like
1258000	1260000	Super Mario Brothers
1260000	1262000	Final Fantasy 7
1262000	1264000	Games that have been
1264000	1266000	Landmark for that generation
1266000	1268000	I honestly think Portal 2 fits into that
1268000	1270000	For this generation
1270000	1272000	I think this is like a
1272000	1274000	Legendary status of a game
1274000	1276000	Honestly
1276000	1278000	It really just took the first one
1278000	1280000	And it's like, wow, people kind of like this idea
1280000	1282000	And this concept
1282000	1284000	We're just going to, again, infuse all this new stuff into it
1284000	1286000	And it's just given it all this energy
1286000	1288000	And now a story that's really taken off on its own
1288000	1290000	And all these different concepts
1290000	1292000	I mean, I really think
1292000	1294000	This game is going to just stand the test of time
1294000	1296000	As this is really a great game
1296000	1298000	That's really easy to get into
1298000	1300000	It's a first person shooter for people who hate first person shooters
1300000	1302000	That's one of the
1302000	1304000	Really interesting things about it
1304000	1306000	And the story is well done, the voice acting is
1306000	1308000	Phenomenal
1308000	1310000	And then there's a co-op mode on top of all of that
1310000	1312000	And I think it's just
1312000	1314000	A great game
1314000	1316000	I really try to keep myself spoiler free
1316000	1318000	And I've been very happy with some of the twists and turns
1318000	1320000	That the story has been taking
1320000	1324000	I was really expecting it to just be
1324000	1326000	Kind of a continuation of Portal 1
1326000	1328000	Where you would just have more test chambers
1328000	1330000	And explore the story a little more
1330000	1332000	But there's much more here
1332000	1334000	Than just more test chambers
1334000	1336000	And that's all I'm really going to say
1336000	1338000	Although there are a lot of those
1338000	1340000	There are a lot of those
1340000	1342000	But there's much more
1342000	1344000	This game digs beneath the surface
1344000	1346000	And I don't just mean beneath the surface
1346000	1348000	Of the test chambers
1348000	1350000	Which you do get to see as well
1350000	1352000	Which is really cool
1352000	1354000	GLaDOS as a character
1354000	1356000	Is legendary
1356000	1358000	Where are you right now?
1358000	1360000	In the world of video games
1360000	1364000	I have done the blue repulsion gel
1364000	1366000	A couple times
1366000	1368000	So you've seen Potato?
1368000	1370000	I have seen Potato
1370000	1372000	Okay, I'm trying to figure out where you are
1372000	1374000	So I get where the Potato Sack joke comes from now
1374000	1376000	That didn't occur to me until later
1376000	1378000	But yes, so I get where that all comes from
1378000	1380000	My favorite still is
1380000	1382000	BIRD KILL IT
1382000	1384000	So yeah
1384000	1386000	And I have to say I was reading on a few things
1386000	1388000	And you know where you see
1388000	1390000	All the old potatoes
1390000	1392000	The bring your daughter to work
1392000	1394000	Day science fair
1394000	1396000	The big mutated potato
1396000	1398000	Is supposed to be Shell's project
1398000	1400000	Interesting
1400000	1402000	Interesting
1402000	1404000	Alright
1404000	1406000	So anyway
1406000	1408000	Some comments in our chat room
1408000	1410000	Randy in our chat room says
1410000	1412000	Watching Portal for the first time made me think
1412000	1414000	How does someone have the mental capacity to figure out these puzzles
1414000	1416000	You know a lot of it is trial and error
1416000	1418000	I noticed that the second game
1418000	1420000	Really limits where you can put portals
1420000	1422000	More than the first game did
1422000	1424000	And that's part of the puzzles
1424000	1426000	They've added all this other stuff into it
1426000	1428000	Like the lasers
1428000	1430000	The gel is a huge thing
1430000	1432000	I got stuck on one puzzle
1432000	1434000	Because of that stupid gel
1434000	1436000	I couldn't figure out how to
1436000	1438000	I didn't figure out that you could actually make gel
1438000	1440000	Fly through the walls that destroy things
1440000	1442000	Otherwise I would have figured it out a lot sooner
1442000	1444000	And just crazy stuff
1444000	1446000	You really have to look around for surfaces
1446000	1448000	That could be a mile high up
1448000	1450000	For you to fling a portal onto
1450000	1452000	It is really an experience
1452000	1454000	To play a game like Portal
1454000	1456000	And I really don't know what else to say
1456000	1458000	The game is outstanding
1458000	1460000	And it's well worth your money
1460000	1462000	If you haven't bought it yet
1462000	1464000	I guess you already know this is probably the type of game
1464000	1466000	That maybe just isn't for you for whatever reason
1466000	1468000	Or you know obviously economical whatever stuff
1468000	1470000	60 bucks is still a huge investment
1470000	1472000	But I don't know what else to say
1472000	1474000	I think most people who want it
1474000	1476000	Already went and got it first day
1476000	1478000	The Steam integration is great
1478000	1480000	I was really surprised at how well
1480000	1482000	Steam integrates with the Playstation 3
1482000	1484000	But you can hit select
1484000	1486000	And it's just like being logged into Steam
1486000	1488000	I don't know what else to say
1488000	1490000	It was pretty seamless
1490000	1492000	You connect your Playstation network account
1492000	1494000	To Steam
1494000	1496000	And then that's it
1496000	1498000	You can hit select and I can see all my Steam friends
1498000	1500000	And who's on
1500000	1502000	And it's just like I'm playing another Steam game
1502000	1504000	But it's on my Playstation 3
1504000	1506000	Now I was wondering
1506000	1508000	If someone picked this up
1508000	1510000	They wouldn't be able to get the Steam
1510000	1512000	Link would they?
1512000	1514000	There is a card
1514000	1516000	That comes with the game
1516000	1518000	That has the code on it
1518000	1520000	So sadly no you wouldn't be able to get it
1520000	1522000	You'd have to buy it new in order to get to both games
1522000	1524000	And it says somehow
1524000	1526000	It says on the back of the box
1526000	1528000	You cannot play co-op
1528000	1530000	On your PC and PS3
1530000	1532000	But I don't know
1532000	1534000	See I haven't really explored that yet
1534000	1536000	Maybe somebody in our chat knows
1536000	1538000	And I would imagine a lot of that is because of the Steam hookup
1538000	1540000	If I log into Steam on my PS3
1540000	1542000	It's not going to let me do it on my PC as well
1542000	1544000	To play the same game
1544000	1546000	But what would happen if I have two
1546000	1548000	Playstation 3 accounts
1548000	1550000	Like for example, Salacious Pop uses my Playstation
1550000	1552000	3 as well
1552000	1554000	What if he connected that to his Steam
1554000	1556000	And then played on my PS3
1556000	1558000	And then I played Steam on my computer
1558000	1560000	Maybe that would work? I don't know
1560000	1562000	Because I can't imagine that the discs are imprinted with the serial numbers somehow
1562000	1564000	So unless
1564000	1566000	Hooking up Steam
1566000	1568000	And hooking up the whole console
1568000	1570000	To that Steam ID
1570000	1572000	I would think you could have that
1572000	1574000	I don't know
1574000	1576000	I'm going to be honest
1576000	1578000	I haven't even really played it on Steam
1578000	1580000	I've been completely satiated with the PS3 version
1580000	1582000	I don't really need the Steam version
1582000	1584000	It's nice to have
1584000	1586000	It's a cool little bonus
1586000	1588000	But I didn't really need it
1588000	1590000	I'm waiting until I can play it on PC
1590000	1592000	Because I'm like that
1592000	1594000	I need the mouse in WASD
1594000	1596000	It really is a lot easier to play on the PC
1596000	1598000	See but see
1598000	1600000	This all goes back to joystick vs mouse and keyboard
1600000	1602000	Some people prefer mouse and keyboard
1602000	1604000	I love the DualShock controller
1604000	1606000	For playing it, it's awesome
1606000	1608000	Great for me
1608000	1610000	Spazzinator in our chat room says
1610000	1612000	Is the cake still a lie in Portal 2?
1612000	1614000	No
1614000	1616000	There is one joke that is
1616000	1618000	Blink and you miss it sort of thing
1618000	1620000	And I like that they did that
1620000	1622000	Because they didn't try to keep the same joke
1622000	1624000	Going through the whole thing
1624000	1626000	I really like that
1626000	1628000	Glados has some new insults and some of them are real good
1628000	1630000	She consistently makes fat jokes about you
1630000	1632000	Which are just outstanding
1632000	1634000	I love the Glados cut downs
1634000	1636000	Some of them are really harsh
1636000	1638000	All I'll say
1638000	1640000	The surprise?
1640000	1642000	When the confetti blows
1642000	1644000	I was dying
1644000	1646000	Alright
1646000	1648000	Next time there will be real confetti
1648000	1650000	Let's see
1650000	1652000	Go into our chatroom at chat.orangelaungeradio.com
1652000	1654000	Let's see
1654000	1656000	Bonds006 says
1656000	1658000	Like the Xbox 360 recovery game tag ability?
1658000	1660000	From Sony?
1660000	1662000	No Rob, stop hoping
1662000	1664000	I don't think that's exactly what I'm talking about
1664000	1666000	Although, yeah it is a little weird
1666000	1668000	That you can
1668000	1670000	You have to
1670000	1672000	We're having this problem now that
1672000	1674000	We have two Xbox 360's in our house
1674000	1676000	If we put the live on one
1676000	1678000	We have to migrate the account to play on the other
1678000	1680000	Xbox every time
1680000	1682000	It's a little irritating
1682000	1684000	It's weird
1684000	1686000	Frisbee in our chatroom says
1686000	1688000	The console versions should let you use keyboard and mouse
1688000	1690000	That would be kind of nice
1690000	1692000	You can hook up the USB stuff and then use that
1692000	1694000	That would be nice
1694000	1696000	I guess maybe that's why they give you the PC one free
1696000	1698000	I don't know
1698000	1700000	Other games I've played this week
1700000	1702000	It doesn't stop there
1702000	1704000	Those are the two big ones
1704000	1706000	I bought a 3DS
1706000	1708000	Chapter 4 on the 3DS
1708000	1710000	I didn't realize
1710000	1712000	Every single freaking fighter
1712000	1714000	From the original
1714000	1716000	Is in the 3DS version
1716000	1718000	That's pretty impressive that they have all that
1718000	1720000	Obviously the graphics have been scaled down a little bit
1720000	1722000	To make it all fit
1722000	1724000	But it's 3D
1724000	1726000	And there's this cool little mode where you can actually play
1726000	1728000	Over the shoulder of one of the characters
1728000	1730000	That it's very 3D
1730000	1732000	Kind of neat
1732000	1734000	All the little modes that they put in that
1734000	1736000	Loki kind of reviewed the title on the show before
1736000	1738000	So I'm not going to rehash everything
1738000	1740000	But I do like that they've put in a street pass feature
1740000	1742000	Where you can fight things
1742000	1744000	It gives you incentive to keep playing
1744000	1746000	So you can collect these little trophies
1746000	1748000	Different from achievements
1748000	1750000	But the little trophies are what you use in street pass mode
1750000	1752000	To help fight other people and so forth
1752000	1754000	And 3DS is a system
1754000	1756000	I'm liking it so far
1756000	1758000	I feel like there's so much more potential there
1758000	1760000	That we're going to unlock in May
1760000	1762000	When they do some of the patches
1762000	1764000	There's a lot in the interface
1764000	1766000	Where you hit the button and it says
1766000	1768000	This feature is not yet available
1768000	1770000	It will be installed through a system update
1770000	1772000	But otherwise the online is much easier on this
1772000	1774000	Than it has been on other systems
1774000	1776000	I couldn't tell you how much
1776000	1778000	I shouldn't say the word impressed
1778000	1780000	But the first time I went into the menu
1780000	1782000	Where I could just see all my friends
1782000	1784000	And if they're online or not and what they're playing
1784000	1786000	The reaction I had of
1786000	1788000	It's about freaking time Nintendo
1788000	1790000	It's still code based
1790000	1792000	It's still code based
1792000	1794000	But it's supposedly one code
1794000	1796000	For everything which is nice
1796000	1798000	And I had some issues
1798000	1800000	With the facial recognition
1800000	1802000	It'll make your little
1802000	1804000	Me avatar
1804000	1806000	You take a picture of yourself
1806000	1808000	You square your head
1808000	1810000	In the frame
1810000	1812000	And it thinks that I have
1812000	1814000	Really huge jowls
1814000	1816000	My head looked like a bell
1816000	1818000	My 3DS is apparently
1818000	1820000	GLaDOS because it was calling you fat
1820000	1822000	I think it was
1822000	1824000	I'm rocking a beard right now
1824000	1826000	And I think it just thought that my
1826000	1828000	Facial hair was face
1828000	1830000	So it's like, yeah
1830000	1832000	Well the good news is if you don't like the me that it gives you
1832000	1834000	You can go in and tweak it
1834000	1836000	And I'll tell you what, the first time you take a picture
1836000	1838000	And have it do a me based on your picture
1838000	1840000	You're not gonna like what comes out
1840000	1842000	I'm just convinced nobody's gonna like the thing that comes out
1842000	1844000	It's the new technological advance
1844000	1846000	Of the driver's license photo
1846000	1848000	Where you get
1848000	1850000	It in the mail and you're like, oh was I sick
1850000	1852000	That day?
1852000	1854000	Exactly, that's a very good way of putting it
1854000	1856000	Alright, so gosh
1856000	1858000	I think I've covered about everything
1858000	1860000	I have Final Fantasy IV, the complete edition
1860000	1862000	On order as well
1862000	1864000	I was frugal in my shopping and I went on Amazon.com
1864000	1866000	And bought Mortal Kombat
1866000	1868000	And Portal 2
1868000	1870000	I got like $20 credit for buying one
1870000	1872000	And $10 credit for buying the other
1872000	1874000	I usually don't give shout outs to retail chains
1874000	1876000	Or anything like that
1876000	1878000	Because we're a commercial free show
1878000	1880000	But I just gotta say as a gamer, I was pretty impressed
1880000	1882000	They only charged me $4 for shipping
1882000	1884000	They had the games there on release day
1884000	1886000	I got $30 worth of free credit
1886000	1888000	Which I used to buy the Final Fantasy IV complete collection
1888000	1890000	Which was the other game I wanted this week
1890000	1892000	So, win!
1892000	1894000	Hey, I'm all for good deals, exactly
1894000	1896000	Alright
1896000	1898000	Let's see, going to our chatroom again
1898000	1900000	Chat.orangeloungeradio.com
1900000	1902000	Bonds006 in our chat agrees
1902000	1904000	It does make you look not like yourself
1904000	1906000	Tigerclaw says
1906000	1908000	Regarding the Streetpass, so far it's been working
1908000	1910000	I go about 4 miles from Streetpass
1910000	1912000	But the fine me still
1912000	1914000	Oh, I don't know
1914000	1916000	Oh, I think I got about 4 me's
1916000	1918000	From Streetpass, but the fine me
1918000	1920000	Still won't let me use them
1920000	1922000	How many Streetpass me's do you need in order
1922000	1924000	For fine me to work without buying the heroes?
1924000	1926000	Good question, I haven't figured that out yet
1926000	1928000	I just got the 3DS last night
1928000	1930000	So I have yet to run into people
1930000	1932000	Or run into the mall or anything
1932000	1934000	Or a place where other gamers are
1934000	1936000	Where I've had Streetpass
1936000	1938000	I've just bought the me's
1938000	1940000	And what I mean by that, the 3DS has a built in game
1940000	1942000	Called fine me
1942000	1944000	And it's a little chibi role playing game
1944000	1946000	Like very bare bones
1946000	1948000	Like fight, magic, run type of thing
1948000	1950000	Very bare bones
1950000	1952000	And you can use coins that you get from the pedometer
1952000	1954000	The pedometer is built into the 3DS
1954000	1956000	And every time you're in sleep mode
1956000	1958000	Every time you take 100 steps
1958000	1960000	You get a maximum 10 coins a day
1960000	1962000	So it's pretty cool because it's encouraging people to go out and walk
1962000	1964000	Or shake their DS repeatedly to get the steps
1964000	1966000	It's kind of like that
1966000	1968000	Walking trainer game that came out
1968000	1970000	For the DSi a couple
1970000	1972000	Years ago
1972000	1974000	It's been actually built into the 3DS
1974000	1976000	And you get coins for doing it
1976000	1978000	And you can buy heroes
1978000	1980000	And as you play through this role playing mode
1980000	1982000	You unlock hats for your me's
1982000	1984000	Like the very first thing you get is a little Mario hat
1984000	1986000	That you can put on your me
1986000	1988000	For your me
1988000	1990000	So if you want to be a little kitty
1990000	1992000	That sounds awesome
1992000	1994000	Alright so
1994000	1996000	Let's move on
1996000	1998000	Oh BlackWolf in our chatroom says
1998000	2000000	I got one me and I used him on fine me
2000000	2002000	So I guess maybe there's
2002000	2004000	Something that Tigerclaw missed in that
2004000	2006000	I don't know
2006000	2008000	Yeah I gotta try and get more me's
2008000	2010000	I was hoping Loki would be here so we could street past the DS's
2010000	2012000	But oh well
2012000	2014000	Easter's more important I suppose
2014000	2016000	We're going to move into some gaming news
2016000	2018000	But first some quick plugs for where you can find us
2018000	2020000	Around the internet we are on Twitter
2020000	2022000	Twitter.com slash OLR
2022000	2024000	As well as Facebook, facebook.com
2024000	2026000	Slash orange lounge radio
2026000	2028000	And of course once again we do tape live
2028000	2030000	At All Games Radio www.allgames.com
2030000	2032000	If you've never joined us for a live show
2032000	2034000	Why not?
2034000	2036000	You should sometime at some point
2036000	2038000	Alright let's get into tonight's gaming news
2038000	2040000	Pop's going to start us off tonight since he's filling in for Loki
2040000	2042000	This is a huge story that's been
2042000	2044000	Covered most major avenues
2044000	2046000	For gaming news and that is
2046000	2048000	The fact that on Wednesday night
2048000	2050000	The Playstation Network
2050000	2052000	Went down like a drunk
2052000	2054000	Bicurious frat boy at a Jack Jansen concert
2054000	2056000	It's just gone
2056000	2058000	That's yeah
2058000	2060000	Wednesday night
2060000	2062000	No PSN, no store
2062000	2064000	No
2064000	2066000	Curiosity
2066000	2068000	Store or anything like that
2068000	2070000	And Sony confirmed that it was
2070000	2072000	Because of an external intrusion
2072000	2074000	Which means they got
2074000	2076000	Text
2076000	2078000	Someone got into the system
2078000	2080000	In a bad way and brought
2080000	2082000	The whole thing down and I guess
2082000	2084000	Given the statement that
2084000	2086000	Cybold
2086000	2088000	Put out
2088000	2090000	It sounds like they're completely
2090000	2092000	Rebuilding their
2092000	2094000	The OS or
2094000	2096000	Whatever the security patch was so bad
2096000	2098000	That they're willing to take down their entire
2098000	2100000	Store for five days now
2100000	2102000	Nearly
2102000	2104000	And what a shitty time for this to happen
2104000	2106000	I mean you know this is the
2106000	2108000	Week to have a Playstation 3 of all
2108000	2110000	Weeks you know Mortal Kombat
2110000	2112000	Has the slight edge having one more
2112000	2114000	Character on the PS3 and let's face it a better
2114000	2116000	Controller sorry
2116000	2118000	And Portal 2 obviously
2118000	2120000	You know they
2120000	2122000	Gabe Newell got up there at
2122000	2124000	E3 and said
2124000	2126000	K my bad on Playstation my bad guys
2126000	2128000	It's actually going to be the system you're going to want to
2128000	2130000	Own Portal 2 on remember that
2130000	2132000	And obviously with the Steam integration
2132000	2134000	It's pretty great and so
2134000	2136000	I kind of wonder how that plays into it like
2136000	2138000	Maybe just the fact that now all of a sudden
2138000	2140000	All these folks who maybe own both
2140000	2142000	Systems were like opting for the PS3
2142000	2144000	Versions in conjunction with whatever
2144000	2146000	Else is going on behind the scenes it brought it
2146000	2148000	Down
2148000	2150000	Yeah I'm sure you know there are people at Valve that
2150000	2152000	I don't want to say they're you know
2152000	2154000	Pissed but it's there
2154000	2156000	It's a huge release for Valve and
2156000	2158000	The
2158000	2160000	Authoritative console version
2160000	2162000	You can't do co-op on it right now because
2162000	2164000	Of Sony so I'm sure they've got all these
2164000	2166000	Developers not just Valve breathing down their neck
2166000	2168000	Going how did this happen you know
2168000	2170000	Consumers are worried that
2170000	2172000	If the hack was
2172000	2174000	You know this bad that it would bring down their
2174000	2176000	Entire network for five days
2176000	2178000	Did they have access to customer records
2178000	2180000	Because a lot of people have their credit cards saved
2180000	2182000	Because they like just the one click purchase
2182000	2184000	I gotta admit that makes me
2184000	2186000	Very nervous because
2186000	2188000	Yeah alright mine's on there and I'm a
2188000	2190000	Little worried about this because
2190000	2192000	You know if that
2192000	2194000	Information got out I want to know
2194000	2196000	Like and I need Sony to be communicating
2196000	2198000	A little better than like yeah we're down
2198000	2200000	Because we got hacked no shit
2200000	2202000	Like we all read the internet
2202000	2204000	Even CNN was reporting about how
2204000	2206000	Anonymous was attacking Playstation Network
2206000	2208000	And whether they're responsible for this or not
2208000	2210000	I mean Sony has an obligation
2210000	2212000	To tell me exactly
2212000	2214000	What information of mine is out there
2214000	2216000	California has some pretty strict consumer rights
2216000	2218000	Laws involving
2218000	2220000	Statements made about their information
2220000	2222000	I think the federal government has some pretty strict laws on that
2222000	2224000	Stuff it's not just California many states
2224000	2226000	Do you know but uh
2226000	2228000	Yeah I mean obviously but the
2228000	2230000	Bummer is I think
2230000	2232000	You can report up to
2232000	2234000	90 days after the incident
2234000	2236000	And I'm sorry Sony I want to know now
2236000	2238000	Like stop giving all this fluff
2238000	2240000	What exactly is happening
2240000	2242000	We're going on 4 to 5 days now
2242000	2244000	You know and
2244000	2246000	You know we kind of joke
2246000	2248000	About how on this show like a lot of times
2248000	2250000	The system will go down for a day or two
2250000	2252000	And it's always like nobody ever remembers
2252000	2254000	Nobody ever remembers that
2254000	2256000	Xbox went down right after Halo 3
2256000	2258000	Came out too you know
2258000	2260000	Gamers pretty much overlook this stuff
2260000	2262000	Because once it's fixed then they can play their games
2262000	2264000	But this is starting to go on one of those
2264000	2266000	Things where it's getting harder and harder
2266000	2268000	To say you're just going to easily forget this
2268000	2270000	Especially if we find out
2270000	2272000	That our information was at risk
2272000	2274000	That is going to be a huge
2274000	2276000	Huge
2276000	2278000	Smack in the face of digital distribution
2278000	2280000	Is the new model and GameStop
2280000	2282000	Will buy breathe a huge sigh of relief
2282000	2284000	Because they'll be open that much longer
2284000	2286000	I think with the Xbox
2286000	2288000	They've had the gold which is
2288000	2290000	The 4 pay platform you know
2290000	2292000	For Xbox Live that's been around
2292000	2294000	Longer more people depend on that for the
2294000	2296000	Co-op playing for Netflix
2296000	2298000	Whereas the PSN you know
2298000	2300000	You post your trophies and you do some matching service
2300000	2302000	On it but PSN
2302000	2304000	Because it doesn't have I mean if you don't buy
2304000	2306000	The download games
2306000	2308000	From PSN there's really no reason
2308000	2310000	For them to have your credit card information
2310000	2312000	Whereas on the Xbox Live service
2312000	2314000	You need a credit card for gold period
2314000	2316000	I actually don't put
2316000	2318000	Any of my information in those if I can
2318000	2320000	Help it because with
2320000	2322000	Xbox you put it in there they will find
2322000	2324000	A way that
2324000	2326000	Even if you unintentionally
2326000	2328000	Press something they're still going to charge you
2328000	2330000	So it's best not to have it in there
2330000	2332000	At all just buy the points through
2332000	2334000	The internet for the PlayStation Network
2334000	2336000	What I would do is I would I don't know if you can
2336000	2338000	Do this anymore but I would go onto the site
2338000	2340000	The website PlayStation Network put
2340000	2342000	Some money in my bucket or whatever
2342000	2344000	Then buy the game through the PS3
2344000	2346000	That way I can do a one-time transaction
2346000	2348000	And they don't have my credit card saved in there
2348000	2350000	Because otherwise I don't trust it well this might
2350000	2352000	Be one of those tough lessons learned I mean granted
2352000	2354000	I have a pretty good bank who you know
2354000	2356000	Isn't gonna you know if I were to something bad were
2356000	2358000	To happen they're not gonna hold me liable for it
2358000	2360000	But it the whole thing will just piss me off more
2360000	2362000	It'll piss me off more
2362000	2364000	Whoever hacked this thing which now
2364000	2366000	We can't figure out if it was anonymous or not
2366000	2368000	And this is
2368000	2370000	Really interesting because this just pulls
2370000	2372000	Back this whole other layer of
2372000	2374000	What is anonymous all about
2374000	2376000	Because because of the fact that they don't
2376000	2378000	Have a face they are anonymous
2378000	2380000	So to speak it is so easy
2380000	2382000	For the media to blame them for this
2382000	2384000	Which is what's happening they may not be responsible
2384000	2386000	But they're getting the blame for this because
2386000	2388000	There's no one to defend anonymous because they're anonymous
2388000	2390000	And that adds actually to their notoriety
2390000	2392000	Yeah as I understand it
2392000	2394000	They're probably eating it up
2394000	2396000	As I understand it a couple weeks ago when the
2396000	2398000	The GeoHats verdict came down
2398000	2400000	They did a couple days of DDOS attacks
2400000	2402000	Which is where they flood the system with requests
2402000	2404000	That was it so this thing
2404000	2406000	That just brought you know brought the whole thing down
2406000	2408000	Like a house of cards they're like it's not
2408000	2410000	Whoever the people that
2410000	2412000	Yeah whoever the mouthpiece is whoever is calling
2412000	2414000	The shots which is probably
2414000	2416000	They're like it's not us we did our shit three weeks ago
2416000	2418000	Well and also the reason why they
2418000	2420000	Stopped was because they realized
2420000	2422000	They were putting the consumers at risk and that's not
2422000	2424000	What they wanted to do so I actually
2424000	2426000	When you mention that you know
2426000	2428000	They're getting more notoriety
2428000	2430000	I actually this isn't the notoriety
2430000	2432000	That they want they don't want to be responsible for the
2432000	2434000	Consumers because that's who they were trying to defend
2434000	2436000	In the first place so this whole GeoHats thing
2436000	2438000	But unfortunately how easy
2438000	2440000	Is it for the not
2440000	2442000	As tech savvy media mainstream
2442000	2444000	Media to just say well it's
2444000	2446000	Anonymous' fault you know they said they were gonna
2446000	2448000	They put out these videos and Anonymous Anonymous Anonymous
2448000	2450000	Anonymous I mean maybe they like having their name
2450000	2452000	Out there but I don't necessarily think this is
2452000	2454000	What they wanted their name on but because
2454000	2456000	Anonymous has no mouthpiece
2456000	2458000	This could be a whole
2458000	2460000	Subset of the group that's doing
2460000	2462000	This and we just don't know
2462000	2464000	It's interesting
2464000	2466000	That whole
2466000	2468000	Politics or whatever you want to call it behind
2468000	2470000	It is fascinating
2470000	2472000	And just to get to the meat and potatoes of this story
2472000	2474000	Patrick Sebold who is the head
2474000	2476000	Of PR for Sony this is his actual
2476000	2478000	Statement on it
2478000	2480000	Quote an external
2480000	2482000	Intrusion on our system has affected
2482000	2484000	Our Playstation network and
2484000	2486000	Curiosity services in order to
2486000	2488000	Conduct a thorough investigation and
2488000	2490000	To verify the smooth and secure operation
2490000	2492000	Of our network services going forward
2492000	2494000	We turned off Playstation network
2494000	2496000	And Curiosity services on the evening
2496000	2498000	Of Wednesday April 20th
2498000	2500000	Providing quality entertainment services
2500000	2502000	To our customers and partners is our utmost
2502000	2504000	Priority
2504000	2506000	That's their
2506000	2508000	See that's all they got to say about it
2508000	2510000	Part of me is kinda like something really
2510000	2512000	Bad happened this is much
2512000	2514000	More than a DDoS attack
2514000	2516000	Because if that was the case
2516000	2518000	We would not be sitting down talking about
2518000	2520000	Deconstructing the whole fucking thing
2520000	2522000	During Easter weekend
2522000	2524000	Which is the start of
2524000	2526000	Spring break when you have
2526000	2528000	Two of your biggest titles out
2528000	2530000	That is why I'm sitting here going
2530000	2532000	I think private information was
2532000	2534000	Breached and I think it's gonna come out in the next
2534000	2536000	Week that that's what happened
2536000	2538000	And that kinda worries me
2538000	2540000	Like otherwise your timing
2540000	2542000	Is just ridiculous Sony
2542000	2544000	As someone with a
2544000	2546000	Sales analyst background
2546000	2548000	The fact that their store
2548000	2550000	Is offline
2550000	2552000	Like oh yeah that's no revenue for a week
2552000	2554000	That's you know
2554000	2556000	Even a company as big as Sony that makes
2556000	2558000	You know billions of dollars a year
2558000	2560000	If you don't make a penny for five days you will feel it
2560000	2562000	So yeah it's pretty serious
2562000	2564000	Alright
2564000	2566000	Well let's move on with some more stories
2566000	2568000	This one kinda came up while we were off last week
2568000	2570000	But it's just speaking of
2570000	2572000	Demons with multiple heads or whatever you want to call it
2572000	2574000	This is a story that's just been going on and on
2574000	2576000	Over the past couple weeks that
2576000	2578000	You know we didn't have a show last week and that is
2578000	2580000	The rumored new
2580000	2582000	Nintendo console. A new Nintendo
2582000	2584000	Console is rumored to be debuting at E3
2584000	2586000	This June
2586000	2588000	Supposedly launching in 2012
2588000	2590000	It's supposed to be you know more powerful
2590000	2592000	Obviously than the Wii
2592000	2594000	A lot of talk about how it's supposed to be scary
2594000	2596000	Similar to the Xbox 360
2596000	2598000	Where if you develop a game for the
2598000	2600000	360 it's supposed to be just that much easier
2600000	2602000	For you to develop for whatever this
2602000	2604000	New Nintendo console is
2604000	2606000	These leaks are coming
2606000	2608000	From Game Informer who I believe
2608000	2610000	Was sorting a French
2610000	2612000	Site in their news which was
2612000	2614000	The same French site that I believe broke
2614000	2616000	The story on the PSP Go
2616000	2618000	So it's kinda one of those things where like
2618000	2620000	If the site was true before they're probably
2620000	2622000	Right again you know
2622000	2624000	Yeah and Game Informer is the face
2624000	2626000	Of GameSpot
2626000	2628000	And did also Forbes run
2628000	2630000	Or was it Wall Street Journal that ran a story on this
2630000	2632000	Like a really very dry
2632000	2634000	It was enough to break to the mainstream
2634000	2636000	Media and that's just making people give this
2636000	2638000	Thought that it's probably
2638000	2640000	True which
2640000	2642000	I'm kind of sad Loki's not
2642000	2644000	Here because I swear to god if you go back
2644000	2646000	In the archives and listen to a show in January
2646000	2648000	I told him I said
2648000	2650000	Nintendo's gonna announce a new console at E3
2650000	2652000	This year and he's like no they're not the Wii's still
2652000	2654000	Printing money I said what do they have coming
2654000	2656000	Out on the Wii there is no
2656000	2658000	Big title on the Wii right now except
2658000	2660000	Zelda that is it
2660000	2662000	And now they've pushed Zelda back
2662000	2664000	What's the real reason Zelda just
2664000	2666000	Got pushed back everybody
2666000	2668000	That game was ready to roll I'll bet you
2668000	2670000	Anything but now it's been pushed back why
2670000	2672000	It's getting the same treatment that the
2672000	2674000	Last Zelda game did
2674000	2676000	Guarantee it
2676000	2678000	And it's gonna be multi
2678000	2680000	Console just like the last one
2680000	2682000	And oh I wanted him to be here so bad
2682000	2684000	So I could point I told you so I told you so
2684000	2686000	But yeah this
2686000	2688000	And honestly I kind of
2688000	2690000	See this as kind of a duh
2690000	2692000	What else did Nintendo have to talk about at E3 this year
2692000	2694000	As far as consoles go
2694000	2696000	I mean I should say
2696000	2698000	Living room consoles go the 3DS
2698000	2700000	Obviously is gonna be the clearly
2700000	2702000	They're gonna roll out the Mario game and the
2702000	2704000	Kid Icarus game and those are gonna be their big titles that are gonna
2704000	2706000	Sell more this year as they talk about
2706000	2708000	Netflix and some of the other multimedia
2708000	2710000	Guaranteed you're gonna see that and whatever
2710000	2712000	Way we can make 9 year olds
2712000	2714000	Wanna have a 3DS they're gonna
2714000	2716000	Try to sell as many of those under the Christmas tree as they can
2716000	2718000	More Pokemans
2718000	2720000	Yeah and the rumor is there's gonna be a Pokemon
2720000	2722000	Announcement at some point as well
2722000	2724000	So I would take that
2724000	2726000	A little closer to Tokyo Game Show but sure
2726000	2728000	That's an inevitable as well
2728000	2730000	Pokemon Plaid and Pokedot
2730000	2732000	Pokemon 3D
2732000	2734000	But as far as you know
2734000	2736000	Living room consoles go it's been dead
2736000	2738000	On Nintendo's front I mean even with the
2738000	2740000	Zelda game if that game
2740000	2742000	Was really coming out like soon
2742000	2744000	We would be flooded with more
2744000	2746000	More uh
2746000	2748000	I don't know screenshots
2748000	2750000	And videos and things of that nature
2750000	2752000	So guarantee it there's a new console in the
2752000	2754000	Works I mean Nintendo has to play
2754000	2756000	Catch up in some regards to this
2756000	2758000	It prints money
2758000	2760000	Well there's even more rumors that um
2760000	2762000	There's even more rumors
2762000	2764000	That follow up with this
2764000	2766000	And some of it has to do with the
2766000	2768000	Controller I suppose it's gonna be
2768000	2770000	With this system
2770000	2772000	Apparently the by the way
2772000	2774000	They're calling this whole thing Project Cafe
2774000	2776000	Which I guess is like you know
2776000	2778000	Dolphin was for the GameCube
2778000	2780000	Right or was that the 64?
2780000	2782000	And then Revolution was the codename for the Wii
2782000	2784000	The Saturn was the Katana I think
2784000	2786000	This will not be called Project Cafe
2786000	2788000	When it comes out guaranteed
2788000	2790000	Yeah the Saturn was Katana but then when they
2790000	2792000	Were doing Pre for Dreamcast it was Neptune
2792000	2794000	That's right
2794000	2796000	They will do some very
2796000	2798000	Weird name that is very
2798000	2800000	One syllable type of easy thing just like
2800000	2802000	You know Wii was they'll do something like that
2802000	2804000	But anyway supposedly the
2804000	2806000	Controller is supposed to be like an iPad
2806000	2808000	With buttons 8 buttons
2808000	2810000	2 analog sticks a camera a
2810000	2812000	6.2 inch touch screen
2812000	2814000	That's kind of weird because that
2814000	2816000	Means the controllers themselves
2816000	2818000	Would cost several hundred dollars
2818000	2820000	If they're as fancy as everyone
2820000	2822000	Thinks they are now see part of me says
2822000	2824000	I don't necessarily think they're as good
2824000	2826000	As an iPad or an iPod
2826000	2828000	Because you know what I think about I've seen these
2828000	2830000	Printers for sale at Fry's
2830000	2832000	That have a removable touch screen type of thing
2832000	2834000	That you can take from the printer
2834000	2836000	And actually look at like the vices
2836000	2838000	And the screen it's okay but it's
2838000	2840000	Kind of cheap I think that
2840000	2842000	Is more what this is going to look like if this is even
2842000	2844000	True because the problem with this is
2844000	2846000	That now that you have these
2846000	2848000	Rumors that look like they're going to be true
2848000	2850000	Everybody's sucking onto
2850000	2852000	It and now once you know you're going to see
2852000	2854000	Fake pictures fake
2854000	2856000	Everybody's going to just have a field day with this
2856000	2858000	I'm just thinking of the VMU now
2858000	2860000	And that's what a lot of people
2860000	2862000	Are saying too
2862000	2864000	That would make sense and I honestly
2864000	2866000	I played little things on my VMU
2866000	2868000	I was trying to raise my
2868000	2870000	Chow
2870000	2872000	In Japanese
2872000	2874000	And the Final Fantasy
2874000	2876000	Oh wait no
2876000	2878000	This is the pocket station too
2878000	2880000	Yeah I totally just switched up
2880000	2882000	That had that really cool thing
2882000	2884000	The integration with the second rival schools
2884000	2886000	Yeah the evolution disc
2886000	2888000	And also
2888000	2890000	Nintendo has kind of
2890000	2892000	Ever since they GameCube
2892000	2894000	They've been the more affordable
2894000	2896000	Family friendly option
2896000	2898000	So they can't go all high tech and put out
2898000	2900000	You know a $600 system because that's
2900000	2902000	Going to go against what their business model
2902000	2904000	Has been for like 7 years now
2904000	2906000	I agree this has to be a cheap
2906000	2908000	System and I don't mean like they could probably
2908000	2910000	Get away with selling it for $300
2910000	2912000	Maybe $400 if it's that fucking good
2912000	2914000	But it's going to have to be cheaper
2914000	2916000	Than like an iPad
2916000	2918000	You know how much was the Wii when it first came out? 250
2918000	2920000	But of course it was supposed to be the budget system
2920000	2922000	It was a steal yeah
2922000	2924000	I honestly don't see them putting out such an expensive
2924000	2926000	Piece of technology as a controller
2926000	2928000	I truly think if this is even true
2928000	2930000	I really think you're looking at something
2930000	2932000	Like those printers
2932000	2934000	Because those printers are only like $300
2934000	2936000	And they have that little device that you take
2936000	2938000	Right off of them
2938000	2940000	I think we're looking at something more like that
2940000	2942000	They're all going to have Game Boy Micros attached to them
2942000	2944000	Well
2944000	2946000	Whatever will help them sell
2946000	2948000	More virtual console games
2948000	2950000	I would think your 3DS
2950000	2952000	Would be the ideal controller for this system
2952000	2954000	If they really want to
2954000	2956000	Have that synergy
2956000	2958000	Like remember back in the day
2958000	2960000	Remember
2960000	2962000	The Advance had the link cable to the GameCube
2962000	2964000	We needed it for Animal Crossing
2964000	2966000	To do the island
2966000	2968000	There were 3 games that used it
2968000	2970000	Animal Crossing, the Pacman
2970000	2972000	Versus, and Zelda
2972000	2974000	Sonic Adventure 2 and the Sonic
2974000	2976000	Advance games
2976000	2978000	The Chao trading
2978000	2980000	And then you can do weird things like unlock original Metroid
2980000	2982000	But I don't consider that a full feature
2982000	2984000	That's just, you know
2984000	2986000	Quick tangent about the Wii real quick
2986000	2988000	It's hooked up now at your place
2988000	2990000	For the first time in like 16 months
2990000	2992000	Yes I did, I hooked up the Wii for the first time in 16 months
2992000	2994000	And what did I play on it?
2994000	2996000	I think Super Metroid, we also hooked up the Super Nintendo
2996000	2998000	I found my bonafide Super Nintendo
2998000	3000000	And we were playing Mortal Kombat
3000000	3002000	Like the real Mortal Kombat
3002000	3004000	That was kind of cool
3004000	3006000	I'm a little distracted right now
3006000	3008000	I don't want to call this breaking news or whatever
3008000	3010000	But I just have to throw this out here because I know Dark Sakura
3010000	3012000	Is going to be interested in this
3012000	3014000	And Mikolatov, if you're listening, which I know you are, you need to post his link in chat
3014000	3016000	Because he's showing me graphics from Phantasy Star
3016000	3018000	Online 2
3018000	3020000	Yeah, my friend Krista posted those images today
3020000	3022000	I guess more information came out on this
3022000	3024000	I have not seen this at all
3024000	3026000	Technically she posted them yesterday from Japan
3026000	3028000	There's more information on 4gamer.net
3028000	3030000	Yeah
3030000	3032000	This looks like Universe
3032000	3034000	Kind of
3034000	3036000	Like in high def and these cool little screens
3036000	3038000	I miss Phantasy Star Online
3038000	3040000	I do too
3040000	3042000	And there was just something missing in Phantasy Star Universe
3042000	3044000	So I hope Sega has figured it out
3044000	3046000	Who am I kidding?
3046000	3048000	I'm going to get that game when it comes out
3048000	3050000	I'm not even going to lie
3050000	3052000	Oh, Ziba reminded me
3052000	3054000	Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles 2
3054000	3056000	For the Game Boy Advance controller
3056000	3058000	That's right
3058000	3060000	I guess there were a few, not just one or two games
3060000	3062000	And Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles
3062000	3064000	Was a pretty cool game too
3064000	3066000	And those were all games
3066000	3068000	That very few people ever really got to experience
3068000	3070000	Because the setup for it was so damn expensive
3070000	3072000	But yeah, the Crystal Chronicles
3072000	3074000	Thing was so cool
3074000	3076000	Alright
3076000	3078000	Anyhow, one other rumor
3078000	3080000	About the new Nintendo system
3080000	3082000	Supposedly, Nintendo is
3082000	3084000	Trying to make nice nice with Rockstar
3084000	3086000	Trying to get them to develop for the Wii 2
3086000	3088000	And
3088000	3090000	This is a report
3090000	3092000	From, what is this, Zero One Net
3092000	3094000	Which I think is also Go Nintendo
3094000	3096000	I don't know, it's all over the internet somewhere
3096000	3098000	Saying that Rockstar
3098000	3100000	Apparently is
3100000	3102000	Being courted for Grand Theft Auto 5
3102000	3104000	To release in, well
3104000	3106000	2012 is supposed to be when Grand Theft Auto 5 comes out
3106000	3108000	And Nintendo is supposedly courting them
3108000	3110000	To release the game on
3110000	3112000	This new Nintendo system as well
3112000	3114000	Which really, it makes sense
3114000	3116000	And it's not like Rockstar hates Nintendo
3116000	3118000	Rockstar put out that mediocre
3118000	3120000	Grand Theft Auto game on the DS
3120000	3122000	Remember, the Chinatown Wars or whatever
3122000	3124000	So it would not be unheard of
3124000	3126000	For Rockstar to develop for the Nintendo console
3126000	3128000	But I think if Nintendo wanted to be serious
3128000	3130000	About the whole, hey
3130000	3132000	We're going back for the hardcore gamer
3132000	3134000	This year
3134000	3136000	Maybe that'll be Reggie Zangle when he takes the E3 stage
3136000	3138000	We've made a gaming console for everybody
3138000	3140000	We've made a gaming console
3140000	3142000	For those that want to play their Wii games on HD
3142000	3144000	We've made a gaming console for kids
3144000	3146000	We've made a gaming console for the hardcore gamer
3146000	3148000	You want proof?
3148000	3150000	We're getting Grand Theft Auto 5
3150000	3152000	Bet you never thought you'd hear me saying that
3152000	3154000	You know that's not going to happen
3154000	3156000	Well, he won't say it like that
3156000	3158000	Oh, I think Grand Theft Auto 5, if the rumors are true
3158000	3160000	About that
3160000	3162000	This is as easy to develop for us
3162000	3164000	With the Xbox 360 and so forth
3164000	3166000	They have that synergy because of the hardware
3166000	3168000	That both systems are using
3168000	3170000	I think this is absolutely true
3170000	3172000	But
3172000	3174000	I think this is also part of fanboy wank
3174000	3176000	It kind of blurs the line
3176000	3178000	I think it's obvious fanboy wank
3178000	3180000	You know how sometimes sites
3180000	3182000	Will report on things that are kind of obvious
3182000	3184000	I think this falls in that category
3184000	3186000	To be honest
3186000	3188000	You know what, I kind of wish
3188000	3190000	That more companies would do
3190000	3192000	One of the things that made the Dreamcast
3192000	3194000	Easy to develop on
3194000	3196000	Is the fact that it would build in a Windows CE
3196000	3198000	Environment
3198000	3200000	And every time a Dreamcast game would load
3200000	3202000	That was built in Windows CE
3202000	3204000	It installed the newest version of Windows CE
3204000	3206000	And then played the game
3206000	3208000	So you always had
3208000	3210000	Your system OS tailored
3210000	3212000	To the game that you were playing
3212000	3214000	Alright, again, going to our chat room
3214000	3216000	At chat.orangeloungeradio.com
3216000	3218000	Is where you want to be
3218000	3220000	Orangeloungeradio.com and click on chat
3220000	3222000	Or on the Game Surge Network
3222000	3224000	On channel Orangelounge
3224000	3226000	Is where you want to be, that's our official chat room
3226000	3228000	Some comments there
3228000	3230000	Saying San in our chat room says
3230000	3232000	Chinatown Wars was not mediocre
3232000	3234000	From what I've heard, I'm just going off Loki
3234000	3236000	Who's like the biggest gramp, that's auto addict I know, sorry
3236000	3238000	DDR Dollar Bill
3238000	3240000	Says Chinatown Wars was just too dark
3240000	3242000	To play, and Randy in our chat room
3242000	3244000	Says Niko Bellic and Nex Super
3244000	3246000	Smash Brothers
3246000	3248000	Now that
3248000	3250000	That could be an interesting set of talks
3252000	3254000	You know what, going with
3254000	3256000	The fanboy wank and this whole thing
3256000	3258000	You know, obviously the Zelda game will be
3258000	3260000	One of the games that has a hybrid thing
3260000	3262000	Going on with the next console, but
3262000	3264000	If they really want me to just lose my
3264000	3266000	Shit on whatever this new console is
3266000	3268000	How about that new F-Zero game already?
3268000	3270000	Huh?
3270000	3272000	Now that you're going to be all high def and stuff
3272000	3274000	Give me a new F-Zero game, why not?
3274000	3276000	I know seriously
3276000	3278000	The original F-Zero was a launch title for Super Nintendo
3278000	3280000	So it's not unheard of that F-Zero could be a launch title
3280000	3282000	Oh yeah
3282000	3284000	F-Zero and Pilotwings in Mario World
3284000	3286000	Were the original launch titles
3286000	3288000	I remember because I wanted them all
3290000	3292000	So there you go
3292000	3294000	Well how about something else that was on the SNES
3294000	3296000	How about it?
3296000	3298000	And we've already mentioned Final Fantasy
3298000	3300000	But Final Fantasy 6, which was released in the US
3300000	3302000	Initially as Final Fantasy 3
3302000	3304000	It is coming
3304000	3306000	Out on Virtual Console and
3306000	3308000	PlayStation Network
3308000	3310000	So it is
3310000	3312000	Going to be there available to play
3312000	3314000	And I don't
3314000	3316000	However see a date attached to this
3316000	3318000	In fact
3318000	3320000	I am trying to see if there's a date on the
3320000	3322000	Article and it does not
3322000	3324000	The release date is soon
3324000	3326000	Yeah it's soon
3326000	3328000	But it is also going to have
3328000	3330000	The full motion video
3330000	3332000	That came with
3332000	3334000	The PlayStation
3334000	3336000	Updates with the Chronicles
3336000	3338000	Oh it's like the opera scene and
3338000	3340000	The Kefka's Tower and a few others
3340000	3342000	Hopefully it won't have the shitty loading
3342000	3344000	Times
3344000	3346000	If it's going to be playing on PlayStation Network
3346000	3348000	It's probably going to be something you're downloading
3348000	3350000	So you won't have to worry about that
3350000	3352000	If it's all off the hard drive then the load time
3352000	3354000	Should be minimal
3354000	3356000	Depending on the emulator, I don't know
3356000	3358000	We've also put Flickr in here
3358000	3360000	Yeah, no
3360000	3362000	I've already got 50 million copies of this
3362000	3364000	Plus the original, so
3364000	3366000	Yeah I've got
3366000	3368000	A ROM, the cart, and then
3368000	3370000	The GBA
3370000	3372000	Port
3372000	3374000	I will probably still buy it
3374000	3376000	I will still buy it because I'm a consumer whore
3376000	3378000	And how?
3378000	3380000	And Final Fantasy 6
3380000	3382000	Is so fucking good
3382000	3384000	It's
3384000	3386000	So good
3386000	3388000	That was the game
3388000	3390000	When I was like 17, 18 years old
3390000	3392000	Now I told you about how I
3392000	3394000	Stayed home from school for a week
3394000	3396000	To play it
3396000	3398000	By telling everyone I had the flu
3398000	3400000	Final Fantasy 7
3400000	3402000	People hate on Final Fantasy 7
3402000	3404000	Because it's not more
3404000	3406000	Final Fantasy 6
3406000	3408000	Let's be honest, people didn't like the 3D thing
3408000	3410000	And people didn't like the whole Neo
3410000	3412000	7 was a great game
3412000	3414000	It was, but people hate on it because it wasn't
3414000	3416000	More of 6
3416000	3418000	7 was rushed by Sony
3418000	3420000	So it wasn't really even done
3420000	3422000	But yeah, I really wish that
3422000	3424000	5 and 6 got the DS
3424000	3426000	3D treatment that 3 and 4 did
3426000	3428000	Because those remakes were so good
3428000	3430000	But I guess on the 3DS the same thing could happen
3430000	3432000	Oh yeah, oh yeah, absolutely
3432000	3434000	Going to our chatroom at chat.orangelaunchready.com
3434000	3436000	Lots of
3436000	3438000	People perking up at the idea
3438000	3440000	Of F-Zero on the new Nintendo console
3440000	3442000	Being possible launch title
3442000	3444000	BlackWolf says F-Zero yes
3444000	3446000	I agree with F-Zero, Mieleki F-Zero
3446000	3448000	Mieleki F-Zero
3448000	3450000	Oh no, I'm sorry, Mieleki F-Zero was from Flaming Toilet
3450000	3452000	In our chatroom
3452000	3454000	BlackWolf continued up saying
3454000	3456000	F-Zero GX equals most beautiful GameCube game
3456000	3458000	Absolutely
3458000	3460000	You could put that game in the Wii
3460000	3462000	And you would not even be able to tell
3462000	3464000	It's a game from last gen
3464000	3466000	F-Zero GX is so good
3466000	3468000	It's like my favorite racing game
3468000	3470000	I think almost ever
3470000	3472000	Let's see
3472000	3474000	Kaijuto, not much of a fan
3474000	3476000	Of F-Zero, people love that F-Zero
3476000	3478000	I never liked it, it was too fast for me
3478000	3480000	My friend tried to top trade it off to me
3480000	3482000	And I hate it, well I'm talking about the first
3482000	3484000	F-Zero, that's the only one I saw and knew of
3484000	3486000	It made me sick, never liked it
3486000	3488000	See that's what I liked about F-Zero, was that it was fast
3488000	3490000	It's like
3490000	3492000	I don't know, it's like
3492000	3494000	When I first saw the commercials for
3494000	3496000	Blur and everything, I kind of thought it was
3496000	3498000	Going to be like F-Zero with real cars
3498000	3500000	I just don't think anything
3500000	3502000	Is going to be quite like F-Zero, but F-Zero
3502000	3504000	If that makes any sense
3504000	3506000	It's just such an awesome racing game
3506000	3508000	Rama in our chat room says
3508000	3510000	People hate On7 because it's the most popular
3510000	3512000	Hoard out and overplayed in the fandoms
3512000	3514000	Yeah
3514000	3516000	Yeah
3516000	3518000	That's part of it too
3518000	3520000	Alright, moving on with some more gaming news
3520000	3522000	SalaciousPop, what do you got for us?
3522000	3524000	Microsoft has registered a patent
3524000	3526000	For networked and
3526000	3528000	Personalized Kinect profiles
3528000	3530000	So that
3530000	3532000	People can get
3532000	3534000	The Kinect to remember their own
3534000	3536000	Unique mannerisms
3536000	3538000	And how to interact with the device
3538000	3540000	And also
3540000	3542000	That profile would follow you
3542000	3544000	If you ever went to a different
3544000	3546000	Xbox and imported your
3546000	3548000	It would be attached to your
3548000	3550000	Gamertag, is what I'm trying to say
3550000	3552000	And you can also use it to communicate
3552000	3554000	Possibly to other
3554000	3556000	XBLA users that may not speak
3556000	3558000	English
3558000	3560000	Or be able to communicate verbally
3560000	3562000	So they might get some
3562000	3564000	I don't know, like sign language
3564000	3566000	Stuff in there, but
3566000	3568000	Like a universal sign language type of thing?
3568000	3570000	That's kind of weird
3570000	3572000	When I was trying to use the Kinect
3572000	3574000	You know, you lift your hand up and you move it
3574000	3576000	Over the tile that you want and you have to hold it there
3576000	3578000	And you wait for the ring to spin around the hand icon
3578000	3580000	I wanted to like
3580000	3582000	Punch it
3582000	3584000	To the tile I wanted and I would go like this
3584000	3586000	And then you were like, no, just hold your hand still
3586000	3588000	And
3588000	3590000	I think if I could go and say
3590000	3592000	I don't like how the Kinect wants me to do
3592000	3594000	This particular
3594000	3596000	Command, here's how I want to do it
3596000	3598000	And have it save that and follow my profile around
3598000	3600000	I think that's what this patent is for
3600000	3602000	That'd be really cool
3602000	3604000	Interesting, but then they throw in this whole
3604000	3606000	Phones and computers into it and I'm like
3606000	3608000	What, the phones are going to have Kinect in them?
3608000	3610000	I hardly think so
3610000	3612000	The profile comes in somehow
3612000	3614000	I guess Kinect isn't just about
3614000	3616000	The motions
3616000	3618000	But voice as well
3618000	3620000	So maybe the voice will activate your profile on the phone
3620000	3622000	Seems a little strange
3622000	3624000	Yeah
3624000	3626000	Anyhow
3626000	3628000	Well I guess we'll see what comes to that
3628000	3630000	That could be something that Microsoft's planning on unveiling at E3
3630000	3632000	We'll see
3632000	3634000	Something else we might find out more on very soon
3634000	3636000	Is what is to come of this
3636000	3638000	Online survey that EA is doing
3638000	3640000	As you know, surveys are a popular
3640000	3642000	Breeding ground for rumors
3642000	3644000	And this time it's about EA Sports
3644000	3646000	Apparently EA Sports is investigating
3646000	3648000	The reception to a paid subscription
3648000	3650000	That would deliver paid
3650000	3652000	Downloadable content for free
3652000	3654000	And make some full versions of upcoming games
3654000	3656000	Available to download before the release date
3656000	3658000	So it's like you could join the club
3658000	3660000	And then you get to break the
3660000	3662000	Excuse me, the embargo on games or something
3662000	3664000	Kind of sounds a little bit like Playstation Plus
3664000	3666000	But unique to EA or something, I don't know
3666000	3668000	Some of the bullet points
3668000	3670000	That were mentioned in the survey
3670000	3672000	Discounts on all downloadable content
3672000	3674000	For participating EA Sports console based
3674000	3676000	Titles
3676000	3678000	Let's see
3678000	3680000	That's the kind of stuff they're talking about asking
3680000	3682000	Also
3682000	3684000	Of course you can get the game on Playstation
3684000	3686000	Network or Xbox Live before it even
3686000	3688000	Comes out
3688000	3690000	That could be indicative of digital distribution
3690000	3692000	And kind of moving more towards that mechanism
3692000	3694000	So you would be able to
3694000	3696000	Bypass the store and buy the game
3696000	3698000	From EA directly so they could keep all the
3698000	3700000	Profits
3700000	3702000	That apparently is
3702000	3704000	The intent here, but you have to pay to join the club
3704000	3706000	To do that, you get to pay to join this club
3706000	3708000	So you can pay EA directly
3708000	3710000	And get the game early
3710000	3712000	That's what I'm reading out
3712000	3714000	Of this, right?
3714000	3716000	It's kind of what it is
3716000	3718000	So, hmm
3718000	3720000	We'll see, also one other thing that they're talking
3720000	3722000	About, the ability to transfer
3722000	3724000	Paid content from your current participating
3724000	3726000	Titles to future title versions
3726000	3728000	So, like, if you buy
3728000	3730000	$50 worth of extra
3730000	3732000	Golf courses in Tiger Woods 12
3732000	3734000	You would get to transport them to future
3734000	3736000	Games, which a lot of other game series
3736000	3738000	Are already doing for free
3738000	3740000	Like DJ Hero did that, right?
3740000	3742000	You had the downloadable thing that would
3742000	3744000	Unlock, oh, anyway
3744000	3746000	You know, launch day DLC
3746000	3748000	The ability to turn left, five bucks
3748000	3750000	Launch day DLC, the ability to turn right
3750000	3752000	Five bucks
3752000	3754000	That's where I'm worried, but it's a racing game
3754000	3756000	So you only need to go forward
3756000	3758000	You don't have to get left and right if you don't want to
3758000	3760000	That's the one thing that excites me about what's
3760000	3762000	Going on with Sony right now, which I know sounds really
3762000	3764000	Messed up, but if it does come out
3764000	3766000	That your personal data was put at risk
3766000	3768000	Digital distribution just got set back
3768000	3770000	Four years, guaranteed
3770000	3772000	If that comes out
3772000	3774000	Yeah, but then I think of Steam, and I
3774000	3776000	Think not really, but
3776000	3778000	I think
3778000	3780000	Yes and no, but
3780000	3782000	On the console level, yes
3782000	3784000	I don't know, Steam
3784000	3786000	Steam is really just a store
3786000	3788000	Where PSN and XBLA is more of an
3788000	3790000	Integrated
3790000	3792000	Matching process
3792000	3794000	They're still stores, but they're stores that are built into your console
3794000	3796000	It's a little different, whereas the PC
3796000	3798000	Isn't so much a console
3798000	3800000	You have the freedom to do whatever you want on the PC
3800000	3802000	Yeah, and there are alternatives to Steam
3802000	3804000	For the PC, it's the same platform
3804000	3806000	Right
3806000	3808000	So we will see what comes of
3808000	3810000	This possible paid subscription
3810000	3812000	In the future, moving on
3812000	3814000	Well, since we were on Steam and this is how
3814000	3816000	I bought the game
3816000	3818000	Super Meat Boy Ultra
3818000	3820000	Edition will be coming out in the UK
3820000	3822000	Sometime between July and September
3822000	3824000	This year
3824000	3826000	It will be published by Lace Mamba
3826000	3828000	Global
3828000	3830000	And it's going to be an actual boxed
3830000	3832000	Edition
3832000	3834000	That is going to be coming
3834000	3836000	Out, so it will have a 40 page
3836000	3838000	Booklet that has never before
3838000	3840000	Seen art, and some behind the scenes
3840000	3842000	Information, an extended version of
3842000	3844000	Team Meat comics, and
3844000	3846000	The soundtrack, and additional audio
3846000	3848000	And a mini poster
3848000	3850000	Yay, a poster
3850000	3852000	And
3852000	3854000	Then you also get a slab of rotted meat
3854000	3856000	And a band-aid
3856000	3858000	And you get a meat dress
3858000	3860000	You get a meat dress
3860000	3862000	Ok, maybe not
3862000	3864000	Maybe they have that as a marketing thing
3864000	3866000	Little bandages, Super Meat Boy Band-Aids
3866000	3868000	See, that would be a good idea to have bandage girl
3868000	3870000	Band-Aids
3870000	3872000	Absolutely

3874000	3876000	Pay, pay, pay
3876000	3878000	Anyhow, let's move on
3878000	3880000	And travel the world with some release dates
3880000	3882000	And see what games are coming out to a store near you
3882000	3884000	It's going to be hard to top last week
3884000	3886000	But we'll see what happens
3886000	3888000	SlicesPop, why don't you start us off with what is coming out
3888000	3890000	This week in America
3890000	3892000	We didn't have a
3892000	3894000	Show last week, there are a few other titles
3894000	3896000	Aside from MK
3896000	3898000	And Portal that came out
3898000	3900000	And that was SoCom 4
3900000	3902000	Was another big one for last week
3902000	3904000	Nobody gets to play it right now
3904000	3906000	Yeah, totally
3906000	3908000	And then Final Fantasy 4, the complete collection
3908000	3910000	On PSP
3910000	3912000	Huge week for games, huge
3912000	3914000	This week upcoming is
3914000	3916000	Pretty sparse
3916000	3918000	Considering people's
3918000	3920000	Wallets can't really take more
3920000	3922000	Gonzo weeks of
3922000	3924000	Game releases like last week
3924000	3926000	So this one is pretty mellow
3926000	3928000	We have Operation Flashpoint
3928000	3930000	Red River on PS3 and
3930000	3932000	360
3932000	3934000	Haunted for PC
3934000	3936000	Operation Flashpoint
3936000	3938000	Red River again on PC
3938000	3940000	Darkspore on PC
3940000	3942000	And
3944000	3946000	IL-2
3946000	3948000	I cannot even pronounce this
3948000	3950000	Stramovic Cliffs of Dover on PC
3950000	3952000	Which sounds like a weird budget
3952000	3954000	Army game, I don't even know what that is
3954000	3956000	But that's it, it's like six titles
3956000	3958000	Bobby Blackwolf in our chatroom is lamenting
3958000	3960000	The non-mention of Conduit 2
3960000	3962000	Which also came out this last week
3962000	3964000	This was
3964000	3966000	Oh there it is, yeah, on the week
3966000	3968000	And poor little Conduit 2 is gonna get that a lot
3968000	3970000	This was not
3970000	3972000	A smart week to release that game
3972000	3974000	Sorry dudes, I don't know what else to say
3974000	3976000	I think some
3976000	3978000	Companies severely underestimated
3978000	3980000	The power of portal combat
3980000	3982000	On top of like SOCOM too
3982000	3984000	SOCOM is a huge game too
3984000	3986000	I actually think it was a dumb week to release
3986000	3988000	Final Fantasy 4 too
3988000	3990000	Especially considering that
3990000	3992000	The PSP does a lot through digital distribution
3992000	3994000	Now, well, nobody can buy that game
3994000	3996000	On the Playstation Network
3996000	3998000	Right now
3998000	4000000	Yikes. Let's go to Japan
4000000	4002000	And see if it's any different over there
4002000	4004000	This week in Japan on April 28th
4004000	4006000	El Shaddai, Ascension of the Metatron
4006000	4008000	Coming out on the Xbox 360
4008000	4010000	This game
4010000	4012000	Is coming out from Ignition
4012000	4014000	It's kind of an action based game
4014000	4016000	Kind of looking at some of the screenshots here
4016000	4018000	It looks kind of cool, looks like
4018000	4020000	The art style to this is kind of interesting
4020000	4022000	It kind of looks like that
4022000	4024000	Oh, what was that game?
4024000	4026000	I don't know, now I can't even remember the name of it
4026000	4028000	But yeah, it has this really unique art style
4028000	4030000	Reminds me of an old PC game
4030000	4032000	Alone in the Dark, is that what it's called?
4032000	4034000	I can't remember that. Let me see
4034000	4036000	It was a classic game of the week she did not that long ago
4036000	4038000	But I don't know why, the art style kind of reminds me of that a little bit
4038000	4040000	But yeah, it's kind of an action game
4040000	4042000	Maybe in the same vein as like Bayonetta
4042000	4044000	Type of thing where you play a dude with a sword
4044000	4046000	That is really pretty, I'm really big on it
4046000	4048000	Again, that's El Shaddai, Ascension of the Metatron
4048000	4050000	Comes out this week on the Xbox 360
4050000	4052000	Very biblically themed
4052000	4054000	Also this week on the Xbox 360 in Japan
4054000	4056000	Espagluta 2, Black Label
4056000	4058000	Platinum Collection
4058000	4060000	Espagluta
4060000	4062000	Price Reduction
4062000	4064000	That's bullet hell, right?
4064000	4066000	PlayStation 3 also gets El Shaddai this week
4066000	4068000	That's pretty much the only big release over there
4068000	4070000	On the PlayStation 3
4070000	4072000	On the Nintendo Wii this week, nothing
4072000	4074000	You're going to hear that a lot when it comes to the Nintendo Wii
4074000	4076000	Because there's nothing coming out
4076000	4078000	On the Nintendo 3DS, Deca Sporta
4078000	4080000	3D Sports comes out
4080000	4082000	That of course is Deca Sports
4082000	4084000	From Hudson in Japan
4084000	4086000	Coming out on the regular DS
4086000	4088000	Hakoyuki, Yugi Roku DS
4088000	4090000	Comes out this week
4090000	4092000	On the Nintendo DS non-3D
4092000	4094000	That's an adventure game
4094000	4096000	With little chibi characters that I'm sure
4096000	4098000	Most people don't care about
4098000	4100000	Because it's so last gen
4100000	4102000	And then lastly, the Sony PSP
4102000	4104000	Has a variety of games coming out this week in Japan
4104000	4106000	Including Patapon 3, which I believe came out over here as well
4106000	4110000	Saigo no Yakuzoku no Monogatari
4110000	4112000	Comes out as well this week
4112000	4114000	That is from Epic
4114000	4116000	That is a Japanese RPG
4116000	4118000	On the PSP
4118000	4120000	Looks like kind of
4120000	4122000	Man vs. Robot type of thing
4122000	4124000	And lastly
4124000	4126000	Otome wa Onesama no
4126000	4128000	I'm sorry, Ni Koi Shitiru
4128000	4130000	Portable 2
4130000	4132000	Jin no Elder comes out this week
4132000	4134000	As well and that is
4134000	4136000	One more adventure game on the PSP in Japan
4136000	4138000	And this is the one that features
4138000	4140000	Pretty Girls
4140000	4142000	And it looks like you play four Pretty Girls
4142000	4144000	Going on these quests
4144000	4146000	They're like looking through telescopes and dressing up
4146000	4148000	It's like the Spice Girls get their own RPG
4148000	4150000	Look at that
4150000	4152000	In Japan. How about Europe?
4152000	4154000	We have a few things for Europe
4154000	4156000	On the
4156000	4158000	26th is Mythos
4158000	4160000	And the 27th is Outland
4160000	4162000	And the 28th is Darkspore
4162000	4164000	Shin Megami Tensei Persona 3
4164000	4166000	Portable
4166000	4168000	Also on the 29th is Thor the video game
4168000	4170000	And
4170000	4172000	Virtua Tennis 4
4172000	4174000	That's it
4174000	4176000	Yay Virtua Tennis
4176000	4178000	Let's move on with another story
4178000	4180000	From Salacious Pot. The classic game of the week
4180000	4182000	Is coming up in just a little bit. Stay tuned
4182000	4184000	Okay so
4184000	4186000	As of the
4186000	4188000	16th which would have been I guess last
4188000	4190000	Weekend
4190000	4192000	The Wii console has experienced a price drop
4192000	4194000	Best Buy got to do it first
4194000	4196000	For about a day
4196000	4198000	Before everyone else
4198000	4200000	$170
4200000	4202000	And then every other major retailer
4202000	4204000	Started selling it at that
4204000	4206000	Price I think within 48 hours
4206000	4208000	Later so yeah that as of the
4208000	4210000	18th you can get a Wii kit for
4210000	4212000	170 bucks and also
4212000	4214000	Just more recently announced
4214000	4216000	Wii Sports Resort
4216000	4218000	And Wii Party which are the two
4220000	4222000	I guess they're bundle titles that you can also
4222000	4224000	Buy separately. Also got a
4224000	4226000	More of the staple titles
4226000	4228000	Of the current Wii lineup
4228000	4230000	If you just can't get enough Woohoo Island
4230000	4232000	Yeah
4232000	4234000	Those prices dropped
4234000	4236000	$10 down to
4236000	4238000	$39.99
4238000	4240000	Per title starting the
4240000	4242000	25th which is tomorrow
4242000	4244000	So Wii console cheaper
4244000	4246000	And the two staple games
4246000	4248000	If you didn't get them bundled
4248000	4250000	Are now $10 off as well
4250000	4252000	Now I just want to point this out because this is something you're
4252000	4254000	Not really reading in the news but you know
4254000	4256000	Loki has ties when it comes to
4256000	4258000	Selling things and he made this little note
4258000	4260000	In our little thread where we always talk
4260000	4262000	About what stories we're going to talk about on the show
4262000	4264000	And so I'm going to pass this little tidbit along
4264000	4266000	Do with it what you will. He says
4266000	4268000	Just the top five direct
4268000	4270000	Nintendo retailers. Not
4270000	4272000	All retailers. This is a
4272000	4274000	Temporary price drop to clear
4274000	4276000	Overstock inventory
4276000	4278000	I wonder why they'd want to
4278000	4280000	Move Wiis
4280000	4282000	Well I mean one
4282000	4284000	Could hypothesize that the new Nintendo console
4284000	4286000	Plays into this but come on
4286000	4288000	That's going to be a year away
4288000	4290000	Although I
4290000	4292000	I don't know. Part of me wants to say why would you
4292000	4294000	Announce a console at E3 when it's not going to come out
4294000	4296000	Till next year but that's exactly what they did with the 3DS
4296000	4298000	So that kind of refutes that
4298000	4300000	But I would think they would try to get it
4300000	4302000	Something out console wise this year
4302000	4304000	But we'll see. I don't know
4304000	4306000	I don't know what this price drop should be tried into
4306000	4308000	Maybe a new bundle. Maybe that's the
4308000	4310000	Route they're going to go. Maybe they're clearing
4310000	4312000	Overstock so they can do some Uber Wii bundle
4312000	4314000	That's going to come out for the holidays
4314000	4316000	In these two games like I just said
4316000	4318000	If you buy them all a cart you can also
4318000	4320000	Get a bundle with them
4320000	4322000	So they're just
4322000	4324000	Kind of taking up space now
4324000	4326000	There's got to be some type of Uber Wii coming out
4326000	4328000	Towards the end of the year
4328000	4330000	Is it called the Wii Wii?
4330000	4332000	None
4332000	4334000	Alright
4334000	4336000	Something you will not be able to play
4336000	4338000	On the Wii but you'll be able to play it on
4338000	4340000	The Xbox 360 and eventually
4340000	4342000	You'll be able to play it on the PlayStation 3
4342000	4344000	But news came out this week that Child of Eden
4344000	4346000	From Q Entertainment has been pushed
4346000	4348000	Back to September on the
4348000	4350000	PlayStation 3. The game is still
4350000	4352000	Coming out on June 14th for the
4352000	4354000	Xbox 360 with Kinect support
4354000	4356000	So why was it pushed back to September?
4356000	4358000	Well they haven't really
4358000	4360000	Said but they have said that it
4360000	4362000	Will now feature move support for the
4362000	4364000	PlayStation so perhaps that is the reason
4364000	4366000	Why it was pushed back was to include the
4366000	4368000	PlayStation Move support
4368000	4370000	I don't know why they bothered
4370000	4372000	They should have just patched that in later because
4372000	4374000	I kind of think the PlayStation Move
4374000	4376000	Is anyone still all about
4376000	4378000	PlayStation Move right now?
4378000	4380000	I mean one could argue is anyone about Kinect right now?
4380000	4382000	But I think there's at least a few people
4382000	4384000	Still dabbling in Dance Central
4384000	4386000	Once in a while at least
4386000	4388000	But as far as the move goes isn't everyone over that?
4388000	4390000	Well maybe Ubisoft was like
4390000	4392000	Yeah Sony so your network
4392000	4394000	Has been down for five days so we're
4394000	4396000	Gonna give you some time to fix that
4396000	4398000	Well to be fair September no I'm kidding
4398000	4400000	I think this news came out before that I know I'm just being an ass
4400000	4402000	Yeah no I know
4402000	4404000	Alright well let's move on
4404000	4406000	To a segment we like to do on the show every
4406000	4408000	Week it's a chance for Dark Soccer to take
4408000	4410000	A trip down memory lane
4410000	4412000	And visit
4412000	4414000	Classic Games from Gaming's Past
4414000	4416000	It's the classic game of
4416000	4418000	The week segment and Dark Soccer
4418000	4420000	Is gonna dive into the vault head first and
4420000	4422000	Find a game that she says hey
4422000	4424000	You little brats
4424000	4426000	This is a classic game you should check out right
4426000	4428000	Freaking now Dark Soccer
4428000	4430000	What is the classic game of the week?
4430000	4432000	The game of the week is called
4432000	4434000	Narbacular Drop
4434000	4436000	And this is a game I have brought up before
4436000	4438000	I see what you're doing here
4438000	4440000	Exactly I figured with Portal 2 coming out
4440000	4442000	It's best to get to the root
4442000	4444000	Alright let's listen to some of the ambience
4444000	4446000	From Narbacular Drop
4446000	4448000	Yeah
4448000	4450000	Hopefully
4450000	4452000	There wasn't a lot of sound in this game I believe
4452000	4454000	But it had some decent music
4456000	4458000	Well
4458000	4460000	At any rate Narbacular Drop is
4460000	4462000	The precursor to
4462000	4464000	Portal it was
4464000	4466000	A free game online in 2005
4466000	4468000	For the PC ran in DirectX 9
4468000	4470000	And it was
4470000	4472000	The senior game project of students
4472000	4474000	Going to DigiPen
4474000	4476000	They actually named it Narbacular Drop
4476000	4478000	Because Narbacular is not really a word
4478000	4480000	And so it would help the thing be found
4480000	4482000	On search engines really easily
4482000	4484000	So basically
4484000	4486000	The whole premise is that
4486000	4488000	There was a princess
4488000	4490000	No knees
4490000	4492000	As in no dash K-N-E-E-S
4492000	4494000	Who is unable to jump
4494000	4496000	She was captured by a demon and imprisoned
4496000	4498000	So she found out that since
4498000	4500000	The prison is actually a
4500000	4502000	Ascension creature named Wally
4502000	4504000	And has a portal making ability she could
4504000	4506000	Escape through using portals
4506000	4508000	So basically
4508000	4510000	It has the whole first person
4510000	4512000	Shooter vibe like Quake
4512000	4514000	But it has the portals in there too
4514000	4516000	You have to solve different puzzles
4516000	4518000	You can definitely see where this led to
4518000	4520000	Portal
4520000	4522000	So you create the different interconnected portals
4522000	4524000	You can actually shoot portals through portals as well
4524000	4526000	Which was very interesting
4526000	4528000	It really helped
4528000	4530000	But you'd have boxes and boulders
4530000	4532000	And things to avoid
4532000	4534000	You have different switches to do
4534000	4536000	That you can't save in the game
4536000	4538000	And it really
4538000	4540000	Is very complex
4540000	4542000	You only have about six puzzles
4542000	4544000	In that because
4544000	4546000	Again, this was a senior project
4546000	4548000	But it's super
4548000	4550000	It's super good, it's actually pretty
4550000	4552000	Pretty fun
4552000	4554000	And so basically
4554000	4556000	The group that developed it
4556000	4558000	Was snatched right up
4558000	4560000	By Valve and said
4560000	4562000	We like this idea, make us portal
4562000	4564000	And they're like, okay
4564000	4566000	Sure, we'd like to do that
4566000	4568000	And uh
4568000	4570000	So they did
4570000	4572000	And uh
4572000	4574000	It's actually
4574000	4576000	You can actually go get this for free
4576000	4578000	It is online
4578000	4580000	It will run on just about any
4580000	4582000	PC and it's
4582000	4584000	Nothing great to look at, it looks like
4584000	4586000	You know
4586000	4588000	Sprightly like Quake
4588000	4590000	Like early Quake and Doom and Hexen
4590000	4592000	Well I mean, it is 3D
4592000	4594000	But it's 3D with sprite
4594000	4596000	Textures. And I think something is important to mention too
4596000	4598000	It looks nothing like Portal. No, it looks nothing
4598000	4600000	Like Portal. It does not have that test chamber look
4600000	4602000	It looks more like a medieval castle type of look
4602000	4604000	And I think that's one very common misconception
4604000	4606000	About Immaculate Drop, is that it looks like Portal
4606000	4608000	It really doesn't. No, it's
4608000	4610000	It's set, you're a princess escaping
4610000	4612000	From a dungeon, trapped by
4612000	4614000	A demon, so
4614000	4616000	The story is different
4616000	4618000	However, the premise is the same
4618000	4620000	You have to use your portals
4620000	4622000	Solve puzzles and get out, while not being
4622000	4624000	You know, jumped on by creatures
4624000	4626000	And falling in the lava
4626000	4628000	And having GLaDOS, wait, wrong game
4628000	4630000	Right
4630000	4632000	So, it's, it's, I've gotten Immaculate Drop
4632000	4634000	I've gotten a few puzzles through it
4634000	4636000	And honestly, it's a little bit harder
4636000	4638000	For me to get through, because early 3D
4638000	4640000	Like that kind of
4640000	4642000	It gives me a headache
4642000	4644000	If that makes sense
4644000	4646000	Like, I can do all the sprite based 3D
4646000	4648000	Like games just fine, but if it's
4648000	4650000	Actual 3D with the sprite based textures
4650000	4652000	Then it makes me kind of sick
4652000	4654000	But, um, it's, it's still
4654000	4656000	A fun little game, I mean, it's free
4656000	4658000	Why not? And
4658000	4660000	I've got it attached to, well I mean you can't
4660000	4662000	Download it through Steam, but I have it attached to my
4662000	4664000	Steam account, so, I just launch it
4664000	4666000	Through that, but, it's, it's a
4666000	4668000	A fun little game, it really is
4668000	4670000	It's just
4670000	4672000	It's a small download
4672000	4674000	It's really
4674000	4676000	Simple, it's just simple and fine
4676000	4678000	That's all, and so if you want to see the origins
4678000	4680000	Of Portal, you should definitely try
4680000	4682000	Immaculate Drop
4682000	4684000	With the little, horribly drawn
4684000	4686000	Story bits at the beginning
4686000	4688000	It's really neat to see, too
4688000	4690000	Like, how freaking far this game
4690000	4692000	Evolved, too, like it just, it
4692000	4694000	You go play Immaculate Drop, it's, it's
4694000	4695000	Really nothing like Portal
4695000	4696000	This is six years ago
4696000	4698000	But it's, I mean, it's cool, don't get me wrong
4698000	4700000	It's a cool little game, but it's, uh
4700000	4702000	And the whole point is that
4702000	4704000	The other reason why it was only six
4704000	4706000	Levels is because, number one, it was
4706000	4708000	A final project, but number two, they were trying to
4708000	4710000	Demonstrate that they could establish these physics
4710000	4712000	Within a virtual environment that would
4712000	4714000	Work, so
4714000	4716000	I want to say that the original
4716000	4718000	Way that this was done was by
4718000	4720000	Completely duplicating and re-rendering
4720000	4722000	The room when you threw the Portal
4722000	4724000	But now, with Portal 2,
4724000	4726000	It's just, not with Portal 2, but
4726000	4728000	With the actual Portal, they redid
4728000	4730000	Those, um, those
4730000	4732000	Physics to where it actually would just
4732000	4734000	Respawn you through a particular point
4734000	4736000	I remember, um
4736000	4738000	There's a
4738000	4740000	Something about this on the Portal
4740000	4742000	Commentary, where they were
4742000	4744000	Talking about the difference in, um
4744000	4746000	Programming and what went into
4746000	4748000	You know, what they changed
4748000	4750000	From Immaculate Drop to Portal
4750000	4752000	And how certain things wouldn't carry over
4752000	4754000	And how certain things had to carry over
4754000	4756000	So, it's pretty neat
4756000	4758000	Alright, and Valve is one of the few
4758000	4760000	Major studios that are known
4760000	4762000	To do it quite often
4762000	4764000	To, um, hire
4764000	4766000	Employees from the community
4766000	4768000	Whether it be the Phantom community or to just
4768000	4770000	Go to the studio that made Immaculate Drop and just
4770000	4772000	Say, um, we want to
4772000	4774000	You know, buy your shop and
4774000	4776000	Bring you in for this project, and
4776000	4778000	It's clearly smart, and honestly
4778000	4780000	I think that it's for
4780000	4782000	The best for a lot of companies to really
4782000	4784000	Look toward the new generation coming out and they
4784000	4786000	Give the new people a chance
4786000	4788000	Because
4788000	4790000	With so few
4790000	4792000	New ideas
4792000	4794000	This is my thought
4794000	4796000	People are going to eventually run out of new ideas
4796000	4798000	There's not going to be anything new anymore
4798000	4800000	People are going to think of it all
4800000	4802000	So you need to get a fresh source of
4802000	4804000	Information instead of, you know, people
4804000	4806000	Who are maybe a few years stale
4806000	4808000	So I think it's a great idea
4808000	4810000	Alright
4810000	4812000	They totally get kudos
4812000	4814000	There it is, your classic game of the week, an Arbacular Drop
4814000	4816000	A little bit newer of a game, but certainly
4816000	4818000	With all the brouhaha about
4818000	4820000	Portal 2 this week, it's important to know the roots
4820000	4822000	Of such a landmark game
4822000	4824000	I would seriously like
4824000	4826000	At least five of our listeners
4826000	4828000	To download it and send me an email
4828000	4830000	What you think of it
4830000	4832000	And it's super free, right?
4832000	4834000	You can download it all over the place
4834000	4836000	Alright
4836000	4838000	There it is, and that's usually your classic games of the week
4838000	4840000	Are like obscure fucking Sega titles
4840000	4842000	That'll cost you $100 on eBay
4842000	4844000	This one is free
4844000	4846000	It's in Space Fantasy Zone
4846000	4848000	You can download that online
4848000	4850000	Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week
4850000	4852000	We're going to take a break here live, folks
4852000	4854000	We've got plenty more show to come
4854000	4856000	It's been a pretty busy week, we've got to talk about Mega Man Legends 3
4856000	4858000	There was some news on that this week
4858000	4860000	Talk about, yet again, Guitar Hero
4860000	4862000	Rob, before I forget
4862000	4864000	I am posting the download link in the chatroom
4864000	4866000	Alright, so go download it ASAP
4866000	4868000	And let Dark Soccer know your thoughts
4868000	4870000	Especially if you haven't played before
4870000	4872000	Alright, we're going to take a quick break, guys

4906000	4908000	We've been talking about a lot of news tonight
4908000	4910000	There's been a lot of gaming
4910000	4912000	Big games that came out in the last week

4914000	4916000	We've got plenty more to cover, though
4916000	4918000	But first, we'll do some plugs for our side projects
4918000	4920000	Some of the other shows that we work on
4920000	4922000	On the side, Dark Sakura, what do you do?

4932000	4934000	Stuff going on this week, last week, and the week before
4934000	4936000	So, um
4936000	4938000	But it's what I do with

4970000	4972000	With Extrovert
4972000	4974000	The best little Horde house in Azeroth
4974000	4976000	Also known as Horde house for short
4976000	4978000	If you like World of Warcraft
4978000	4980000	Or even if you hate it, but you just enjoy
4980000	4982000	Extrovert talking about his Wang
4982000	4984000	And everything
4984000	4986000	And yeah, we were off last week inadvertently
4986000	4988000	We had Comcast go down 30 minutes into the show
4988000	4990000	So we had like a jumbo episode
4990000	4992000	This week, so it's like two hours of wow talk
4992000	4994000	This week, that's a lot of wow
4994000	4996000	Definitely a lot of wow
4996000	4998000	Alright, let's get into some rapid fire news
4998000	5000000	Some quick news stories
5000000	5002000	That we wanted to bring up at some point on tonight's show
5002000	5004000	Loki's gonna start us off
5004000	5006000	Oh wait, he's not here
5006000	5008000	Bob's gonna start us off
5008000	5010000	Well, when you sit in the chair
5010000	5012000	Yeah
5012000	5014000	Bob's gonna start us off cause Loki has the night off
5014000	5016000	Okay, so here's a
5016000	5018000	Feel good human interest story
5018000	5020000	That's gonna make you go aww
5020000	5022000	Skip it
5022000	5024000	A gamer
5024000	5026000	Who goes by the name of Ben
5026000	5028000	I don't know if that's his handle or his real name
5028000	5030000	Started dating
5030000	5032000	A nice young lady
5032000	5034000	And eventually at some point during the relationship
5034000	5036000	When they were hitting it off
5036000	5038000	He gave her the gamer talk
5038000	5040000	If we don't have plans, I'm gonna be parked in front of the TV
5040000	5042000	For hours playing my games
5042000	5044000	And you need to be okay with that
5044000	5046000	And her response was
5046000	5048000	You play Borderlands, right? Fire it up
5048000	5050000	So, yeah
5050000	5052000	So the two of them played all through
5052000	5054000	Borderlands
5054000	5056000	And all of the DLC
5056000	5058000	And I guess Ben went to Gearbox
5058000	5060000	And told him this lovely
5060000	5062000	Story of gamer romance
5062000	5064000	And said that he was going to propose to her
5064000	5066000	And Gearbox
5066000	5068000	Made a video
5068000	5070000	Called Borderlands modest proposal
5070000	5072000	Which you can find on YouTube
5072000	5074000	Where they have their sassy
5074000	5076000	Rude
5076000	5078000	Profanity dropping
5078000	5080000	Mascot
5080000	5082000	Claptrap, he does a
5082000	5084000	Wedding proposal
5084000	5086000	Marriage proposal video
5086000	5088000	For this fan
5088000	5090000	It took him about a week to make it
5090000	5092000	It addresses her by name
5092000	5094000	So Ben was like, hey I want you to look
5094000	5096000	You know
5096000	5098000	Help them get to know each other
5098000	5100000	And then they got divorced in three months
5100000	5102000	No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding
5102000	5104000	See, it's called a Borderlands modest proposal
5104000	5106000	The YouTube channel is
5106000	5108000	Taco Bell manager
5110000	5112000	Yeah
5114000	5116000	Sorry, this is really funny
5116000	5118000	Gearbox helped this loving
5118000	5120000	I hope you like Borderlands and I hope you like
5120000	5122000	Gorditas
5122000	5124000	Because you're going to get a lot of that
5124000	5126000	And I haven't had a chance
5126000	5128000	To watch, it's about a minute and a half
5128000	5130000	And I guess they got their writers to put in some jokes
5130000	5132000	Yeah, so
5132000	5134000	Took them a week to do that?
5134000	5136000	Lord, game companies work slow
5136000	5138000	Alright, I'm just kidding, I'm kidding
5138000	5140000	Okay, so then
5140000	5142000	They got paid in 39 cent tacos
5142000	5144000	Next we have a story about
5144000	5146000	YouTube video sensation
5146000	5148000	Freddy Wong
5148000	5150000	And I look through his channel and I don't recognize
5150000	5152000	Stuff, but
5152000	5154000	He put out a character
5154000	5156000	I guess he's a computer animator
5156000	5158000	And he does a lot of, you know
5158000	5160000	YouTube mini movies
5160000	5162000	And he put out a character called
5162000	5164000	Mr. Toots
5164000	5166000	Mr. Toots is a tiny
5166000	5168000	Knee high unicorn
5168000	5170000	And this here, it's half
5170000	5172000	It's half live action, half CGI
5172000	5174000	And Freddy Wong
5174000	5176000	Finds Mr. Toots in a cardboard box
5176000	5178000	Out on the street, and Mr. Toots
5178000	5180000	Is a little knee high unicorn that
5180000	5182000	Shoots rainbows out of its ass
5182000	5184000	So those of you that are in
5184000	5186000	Robot unicorn attack
5186000	5188000	Are just rainbow unicorn
5188000	5190000	Fandom hilariousness
5190000	5192000	Oh, I love rainbow unicorns
5192000	5194000	This is that guy that did that
5194000	5196000	Portal video
5196000	5198000	The portal gun delivery
5198000	5200000	I'm looking at the video here
5200000	5202000	So here's the, he lifts up the box
5202000	5204000	And there's the little
5204000	5206000	I'm like two seconds behind you
5206000	5208000	Creepy looking unicorn
5208000	5210000	Aw, there's the unicorn
5218000	5220000	Hey, looks like we got a car coming
5220000	5222000	So let's get out of the road, huh?
5230000	5232000	My favorite is the dude exploding in like the
5232000	5234000	Mortal Kombat blood all over it
5234000	5236000	The skeleton
5236000	5238000	So this is gaming related
5238000	5240000	Because it turns out that Mr. Toots
5240000	5242000	Has been copyrighted and registered
5242000	5244000	To Volition Inc
5244000	5246000	The developer behind
5246000	5248000	THQ's Red Faction
5248000	5250000	And Saints Row series
5250000	5252000	So whether the character came first
5252000	5254000	And the THQ snatched it up
5254000	5256000	Or he was commissioned for this little dude
5256000	5258000	Um, we're like
5258000	5260000	What on earth
5260000	5262000	Is this, is Volition gonna do with this character?
5262000	5264000	This guy actually
5264000	5266000	Borrowed the model
5266000	5268000	He credits him in the end of the video
5268000	5270000	Borrowed the model from somebody
5270000	5272000	So it could be like some cross promotion
5272000	5274000	And see I love this joke in our chatroom from Randy
5274000	5276000	Cause somebody had to make this joke
5276000	5278000	chat.orangestonshoot.com
5278000	5280000	Mr. Toots and the pink anus
5280000	5282000	Remember the magical unicorn game on Steam with the
5282000	5284000	Pink anus
5284000	5286000	A-E-N-U-S that you buy as a material
5286000	5288000	Yeah, lots of anus going on in this game
5288000	5290000	Oh yeah, so it does look like
5290000	5292000	That Mr. Toots came from THQ first
5292000	5294000	And then this Freddie Wong guy
5294000	5296000	Did the promotional thing for it
5296000	5298000	You know what's funny about the anus?
5298000	5300000	What? Everything's funny about anus
5300000	5302000	I always get it confused with this candy
5302000	5304000	In Japan called A-S-S-E
5304000	5306000	I guess it's A-SE or A-S-ER
5306000	5308000	Uh huh, but it looks like ass
5308000	5310000	When you get it out of the box
5310000	5312000	Mmm, tastes like ass
5312000	5314000	So yeah
5314000	5316000	The biggest part of this story is just the whole
5316000	5318000	What factor and the fact that it's from
5318000	5320000	Volition, so where are they gonna
5320000	5322000	Drop this dude? Maybe he'll be
5322000	5324000	A playable character in Saints Row 3
5324000	5326000	You know, you're running
5326000	5328000	You're on drug missions and instead of
5328000	5330000	Getting an Uzi you're just shooting rainbows out of your ass
5330000	5332000	At people, I don't know
5332000	5334000	Ass
5334000	5336000	Thank you to our soccer for derailing the show with ass
5336000	5338000	And my last
5338000	5340000	Quickfire story is even though
5340000	5342000	Activision has pulled the plug on the
5342000	5344000	XYZ
5344000	5346000	Hero franchises
5346000	5348000	With guitar or DJ
5348000	5350000	It looks like DJ Hero 2 is getting
5350000	5352000	At least one more
5352000	5354000	DLC pack, not sure if it's the last
5354000	5356000	But it's still getting content
5356000	5358000	And it's a UltraMix pack by
5358000	5360000	I'm blanking
5360000	5362000	I just had it up here
5362000	5364000	Deadmau5, sorry
5364000	5366000	Deadmau5 is putting out a
5366000	5368000	Three song
5368000	5370000	Track pack for DJ Hero 2
5370000	5372000	House Music by Benny Benassi
5372000	5374000	Sophie Needs a Ladder by Deadmau5
5374000	5376000	And We Speak No Americano
5376000	5378000	By YolandaBeCool and
5378000	5380000	DCUP
5380000	5382000	CUP
5382000	5384000	Womp womp
5384000	5386000	You're gross
5386000	5388000	Anything else?
5388000	5390000	That's it for me
5390000	5392000	Let's go to the other music game that comes up once in a while
5392000	5394000	On this program, it used to come up a lot on this program
5394000	5396000	BeatMania 2DX
5396000	5398000	Is having its 19th
5398000	5400000	Version being tested
5400000	5402000	It's called Linkle
5402000	5404000	Not sure what that's supposed to mean
5404000	5406000	It's L-I-N-C-L-E, Linkle
5406000	5408000	It kinda looks like Uncle
5408000	5410000	But with the U kinda, I think it'll be a better name
5410000	5412000	BeatMania 2DX 19, Uncle
5412000	5414000	Uncle! Make it stop
5414000	5416000	These songs don't sound the same
5416000	5418000	What was 17 and 18? It was like Duchess, Empress
5418000	5420000	One was Empress, you got it
5420000	5422000	Empress was one, and then the other one was Sirius
5422000	5424000	But not like the radio, it's the
5424000	5426000	Constellation in the sky
5426000	5428000	So this one is Linkle
5428000	5430000	And I don't know, it kinda has like a sci-fi
5430000	5432000	Theme going on, whatever
5432000	5434000	Some of the new games, or some of the new songs
5434000	5436000	That are coming out in it, I don't, I don't even recognize
5436000	5438000	These bands anymore, like I used to be so into
5438000	5440000	This series. Sota Fujimori
5440000	5442000	I remember him with a song called Lucky Days
5442000	5444000	Let's see, Chorus K,
5444000	5446000	Drive Me Crazy
5446000	5448000	I remember
5448000	5450000	Dark Tetsuya was saying something in the
5450000	5452000	Thread about a song called F
5452000	5454000	Or something like that
5454000	5456000	From like, you know, just like, oh there it is
5456000	5458000	DJ Amuro doing F
5458000	5460000	He did the song A
5460000	5462000	Now he's moved on to other letters of the alphabet
5462000	5464000	So we get a song called F
5464000	5466000	Some of the other things that are coming to
5466000	5468000	2DX 19th style, as I will forever call it
5468000	5470000	A light blue theme
5470000	5472000	Apparently in the game
5472000	5474000	Song previews have been added
5474000	5476000	For normal gameplay mode, that's pretty cool
5476000	5478000	So you can actually hear what the song sounds like
5478000	5480000	Finally, 19 games later
5480000	5482000	Let's see, a hard EX
5482000	5484000	Option added
5484000	5486000	It is even harder than hard
5486000	5488000	That's a direct quote, harder than hard
5488000	5490000	And some songs, unfortunately
5490000	5492000	Have been removed from the game
5492000	5494000	Because, you know, they have to delete
5494000	5496000	Old songs to make room for the new ones
5496000	5498000	Luckily, because I don't follow the series anymore
5498000	5500000	I don't recognize any of these songs that they've removed
5502000	5504000	But there you go, Beat Media 2DX
5504000	5506000	Linkle. Now, I would care about
5506000	5508000	Beat Media 2DX again if they would put out the home versions
5508000	5510000	Because, especially if they came out on PlayStation 3
5510000	5512000	Yeah, PlayStation 3
5512000	5514000	Because it's not region coded
5514000	5516000	And you have your controllers that we
5516000	5518000	Packed, and I want to play those
5518000	5520000	We're already getting Tingle things in the chat room
5520000	5522000	By the way
5522000	5524000	Tingle and Linkle? Nice
5524000	5526000	You know, Tingle
5526000	5528000	If Tingle and Link had a baby
5528000	5530000	It would be Linkle
5530000	5532000	BlackWolf in our chat room says
5532000	5534000	2DX lives on where Guitar Hero dies
5534000	5536000	Well, in Japan anyway
5536000	5538000	But you don't really see anything about it here
5538000	5540000	They should have an insane 4 controller
5540000	5542000	Version where you use your toes
5542000	5544000	Beat Media 2DX was a lot of fun
5544000	5546000	It really was, I just, I don't know
5546000	5548000	Bring back the Effector Pedal
5548000	5550000	Like, two arcades have it anymore
5550000	5552000	You know, Arcade Infinity is gone
5552000	5554000	You can go to, what, Sunnyvale Golf Line
5554000	5556000	Or Milpitas? One of the two still has it
5556000	5558000	And they got rid of ours
5558000	5560000	That's one arcade in the Bay Area
5560000	5562000	They probably have the one that RVGL got rid of
5562000	5564000	Maybe
5564000	5566000	That's so stupid, they didn't get rid of 2DX
5566000	5568000	Dr. Suya says they deleted Power Dream
5568000	5570000	I did like that song
5570000	5572000	You know what, we just need to
5572000	5574000	Have a Bimani party
5574000	5576000	No, we don't
5576000	5578000	Unless you're going to kick it like it's, you know
5578000	5580000	2002 all over again
5580000	5582000	Well, after three songs
5582000	5584000	And we're all covered in sweat because we're not in the shape
5584000	5586000	That we used to be in doing 9 footer songs
5586000	5588000	No, and that's just from playing 2DX
5588000	5590000	Nice
5590000	5592000	Alright, some other things
5592000	5594000	An Xbox exclusive
5594000	5596000	Mortal Kombat fighter was discussed
5596000	5598000	According to Ed Boon
5598000	5600000	Saying, quote, unfortunately the circumstances
5600000	5602000	Didn't allow us to make a 360 exclusive
5602000	5604000	Character. I'm not allowed to talk
5604000	5606000	Too much about it, but I can tell you we certainly
5606000	5608000	Wanted to do an exclusive for 360
5608000	5610000	But that's all I can say
5610000	5612000	And unfortunately that's leaving everybody to
5612000	5614000	Try and guess, what could the
5614000	5616000	Character have been?
5616000	5618000	Well, I can't really think of that many
5618000	5620000	Iconic, Microsoft licensed
5620000	5622000	Only characters they have
5622000	5624000	Because Kratos obviously is a Sony only
5624000	5626000	Property, he's very recognizable
5626000	5628000	One of the Gears of War dudes
5628000	5630000	Marcus Fenix
5630000	5632000	Master Chief, which would be kind of dumb
5632000	5634000	In that universe, because at least Kratos has got
5634000	5636000	The whole medieval and the blades
5636000	5638000	Right, how about that chick from
5638000	5640000	Cameo, what's she doing these days?
5640000	5642000	That could have been the character
5642000	5644000	She's playing Uno with the Kameo
5644000	5646000	Uno pack, that's it
5646000	5648000	Or a nondescript dude from Fable
5648000	5650000	I think probably what Microsoft had a problem
5650000	5652000	With was the fatalities
5652000	5654000	And it's, you know, to have your character
5654000	5656000	Die a horrible death
5656000	5658000	Is something that's
5658000	5660000	Hard for some people
5660000	5662000	God of War already had the rendered
5662000	5664000	Guts and the eviscerations and the titties
5664000	5666000	For no reason, so Kratos is at home
5666000	5668000	In Mortal Kombat
5668000	5670000	Microsoft doesn't really have
5670000	5672000	A character like that, unless chat can think
5672000	5674000	Of one that we're forgetting
5674000	5676000	Unless, you know, I don't see them
5676000	5678000	Splitting Master Chief in half
5678000	5680000	And his little midsection
5680000	5682000	It's gross, some of those fatalities are gross
5682000	5684000	Which, by the way, I am gonna try and get that video
5684000	5686000	Of my mom playing Mortal Kombat, just so you know
5686000	5688000	Working on that
5688000	5690000	I told her about the project today
5690000	5692000	She's like, what?
5692000	5694000	So I don't know what character it could have possibly been
5694000	5696000	I mean, if it had been Marcus Fenix or something
5696000	5698000	I think the problem would have been with the fatalities
5698000	5700000	That's why they had to change up DC Universe
5700000	5702000	But, I mean, it's one thing
5702000	5704000	To do it for a single Xbox character
5704000	5706000	It's another to change the game for
5706000	5708000	DC Universe, I mean, that's why they
5708000	5710000	Or, I'm sorry, THE DC Universe
5710000	5712000	I'm gonna be confused with the game DC Universe
5712000	5714000	You know what I mean, though
5714000	5716000	One other quick thing I want to say
5716000	5718000	It's about the 3DS Ocarina of Time
5718000	5720000	We all know that game is coming out on the 3DS
5720000	5722000	That's another big thing they're gonna pimp for this holiday season
5722000	5724000	There's gonna be a new feature in the game
5724000	5726000	Called the Boss Challenge Mode
5726000	5728000	It's an all fighting mode
5728000	5730000	You go up against any of the bosses you've encountered on the main quest
5730000	5732000	You can take on the bosses individually
5732000	5734000	Or all at once in a continuous battle
5734000	5736000	That's all we know
5736000	5738000	One little unlock feature that'll be in the game
5738000	5740000	Is an extra mode
5740000	5742000	Kinda sounds a little silly to me
5742000	5744000	But I guess whatever extra crap they can throw in there
5744000	5746000	To make it seem worth it again
5746000	5748000	They will do, so we'll see
5748000	5750000	DarkSakura, you got a few stories for us?
5750000	5752000	I have a few
5752000	5754000	Konami Style, which is notable for often having
5754000	5756000	Pretty expensive stuff up there
5756000	5758000	Remember the arcade style 2DX
5758000	5760000	And pop and music controllers?
5760000	5762000	Well, they have a
5762000	5764000	$380 Pyramid Head
5764000	5766000	Sculpture now
5766000	5768000	Tomopop
5768000	5770000	Is basically saying this is the only
5770000	5772000	Officially licensed Pyramid Head
5772000	5774000	To date
5774000	5776000	The actual price is
5776000	5778000	31,500 yen
5778000	5780000	Or about 382 bucks
5780000	5782000	And it's a pretty sick looking figure
5782000	5784000	I gotta say
5784000	5786000	He's all wearing his
5786000	5788000	Skin
5788000	5790000	Outfit with the big
5790000	5792000	Pyramid on his head
5792000	5794000	And the great knife
5794000	5796000	Is actually specifically Silent Hill
5796000	5798000	Homecoming
5798000	5800000	So it looks pretty cool, and I'm gonna show
5800000	5802000	Our chat room what it looks like
5802000	5804000	None of you get to see hahahahaha
5804000	5806000	There you go
5806000	5808000	Chat room
5808000	5810000	Can I jump in with some comments real quick
5810000	5812000	About Mortal Kombat specifically
5812000	5814000	Some ideas from the chat room
5814000	5816000	About who that missing Mortal Kombat character
5816000	5818000	Could have been
5818000	5820000	Randy suggests Larry Erb
5820000	5822000	Come on, it's not supposed to be real people
5822000	5824000	Let's see
5824000	5826000	Defective Candy suggests Clippy
5826000	5828000	The Microsoft Help character
5828000	5830000	I like that idea
5830000	5832000	And then Black Wolf says
5832000	5834000	That the Wii character
5834000	5836000	Could have been Woohoo Island
5836000	5838000	Could have been the character in the game
5838000	5840000	Because imagine how that fatality would have worked
5840000	5842000	The fatality would have been you would have had to run
5842000	5844000	Like in Wii Fit
5844000	5846000	I don't know
5846000	5848000	Imagine Mario and Luigi in a Mortal Kombat game now
5848000	5850000	Where they take a monkey wrench and just
5850000	5852000	Show it through someone's throat
5852000	5854000	All these angry parents writing letters
5854000	5856000	Like I just, I love it
5856000	5858000	I don't know
5858000	5860000	Sorry Jamie, I just had to get that out there
5860000	5862000	I love the Clippy one too much
5862000	5864000	That's a good idea for a character
5864000	5866000	Microsoft Bob
5866000	5868000	Awesome figure, awesome figure is awesome
5868000	5870000	And
5870000	5872000	In Portal 2, the little
5872000	5874000	Egg shaped turrets have an easter egg
5874000	5876000	I have not heard this
5876000	5878000	So I'm going to have to check it out
5878000	5880000	Myself later, but it's on YouTube
5880000	5882000	You guys can check it out
5882000	5884000	Should I be bringing this up here?
5884000	5886000	Um, if you like
5886000	5888000	I'll go read the next story while you do that
5888000	5890000	I got it, I got it, I got it
5890000	5892000	What, this is a little song they sing?
5892000	5894000	What is this?
5894000	5896000	It looks like around level 16
5900000	5902000	Trying to see if I recognize this level
5902000	5906000	Let me skip ahead a little bit
5912000	5914000	The turrets serenading you
5914000	5916000	Is an event that happens later in the game
5916000	5918000	I remember seeing this part
5918000	5920000	In one of the levels
5920000	5922000	Where the turrets were like unreachable
5922000	5924000	This part looks familiar to me
5924000	5926000	But I don't remember them singing like this
5926000	5928000	Weird
5928000	5930000	Alright, anyway
5930000	5932000	It would be funny if
5932000	5934000	When you're doing the defective turrets
5934000	5936000	If you could get one that sings instead of the
5936000	5938000	I'm a turret, huh
5938000	5940000	Turret
5940000	5942000	All of the lethal functioning turrets are female
5942000	5944000	But the incompetent dunce turrets are male
5944000	5946000	But there's
5946000	5948000	Well, and the same goes with Wheatley
5948000	5950000	Yeah
5950000	5952000	But I've noticed that
5952000	5954000	Actually something that they pointed out in the first Portal
5954000	5956000	Is that there's so much
5956000	5958000	Female oriented
5958000	5960000	Stuff in the game like
5960000	5962000	Bring your daughter to work day
5962000	5964000	And GLaDOS being female
5964000	5966000	And the main character being female
5966000	5968000	So they're just keeping up with that theme
5968000	5970000	Yeah, go Pawa
5970000	5972000	It's like the Silent Hill movie
5972000	5974000	Before they added the needless character
5974000	5976000	Sean Bean
5976000	5978000	So
5978000	5980000	More Portal 2 information
5980000	5982000	Is actually for PC and Mac
5982000	5984000	On Steam there are some
5984000	5986000	Fixed patch that will
5986000	5988000	Fix unrecoverable black screen
5988000	5990000	In the elevator save
5990000	5992000	Fixed infinite loop on
5992000	5994000	Mac OS X server
5994000	5996000	Fixed Mac OS X font rendering
5996000	5998000	And glyph corruption
5998000	6000000	Fixed GC memory leak various location
6000000	6002000	Content improvements
6002000	6004000	Support for English subtitles and Turkish builds
6004000	6006000	Because people in Turkey love their Portal
6006000	6008000	Minor string interface glitches
6008000	6010000	Fixes for multiple crashes
6010000	6012000	Improved detection handling
6012000	6014000	Various errors and or crashes
6014000	6016000	Activated UI to enable joystick in game
6016000	6018000	That's pretty cool
6018000	6020000	However it
6020000	6022000	Did get a 10 out of 10
6022000	6024000	From Eurogamer so
6024000	6026000	I think it's pretty sweet
6026000	6028000	It's sick
6028000	6030000	And that's it
6030000	6032000	Nice
6034000	6036000	I was gonna say part of the reason
6036000	6038000	That they had to give the
6038000	6040000	Turkish language support
6040000	6042000	That Hakan from Street Fighter 4 threatened
6042000	6044000	To kick their ass if they didn't add that
6044000	6046000	He was gonna threaten to oil himself up and send nude photos
6046000	6048000	Yes he was gonna oil himself up and send
6048000	6050000	Nude pictures if that didn't happen
6050000	6052000	Let's go to the Twitter
6052000	6054000	Get some Twitter topics, actually shit I forgot to ask
6054000	6056000	For them so we may not have anything on Twitter
6056000	6058000	But let's see what happens if I go to the Twitter
6058000	6060000	Twitter.com slash OLR and let's see what happens
6060000	6062000	When Rob forgets to request these things
6062000	6064000	Let's see if we got anything anyway
6064000	6066000	Let's see, logging into Twitter
6066000	6068000	Clearly I'm prepared for this
6068000	6070000	Segment tonight, Twitter.com slash OLR
6070000	6072000	Oh we do, oh we do have some tweets
6072000	6074000	Look at this, uh let's see
6076000	6078000	Redertainment says
6078000	6080000	On Twitter, given her biting
6080000	6082000	Yet funny insults
6082000	6084000	How do you think GLaDOS would deliver a
6084000	6086000	Yomana joke, I think he meant to say
6086000	6088000	Yo mama, but he typed Yomana
6088000	6090000	Which is actually really funny, I don't know why
6090000	6092000	It would be this, your mother is dead
6092000	6094000	Yeah
6094000	6096000	That's very good
6096000	6098000	I like that, I like that
6098000	6100000	There's a joke in there, alright
6100000	6102000	SSJ100Matt is on
6102000	6104000	Twitter saying
6104000	6106000	Hey it's Easter, what ever happened to Pete
6106000	6108000	Jousting, also what's your
6108000	6110000	favorite totally not kosher for
6110000	6112000	Passover Easter candy
6112000	6114000	Oh good question
6114000	6116000	Waffles
6116000	6118000	I couldn't have waffles
6118000	6120000	I wanted waffles so bad
6120000	6122000	What ever happened to
6122000	6124000	Pete Jousting, actually I was trying to explain
6124000	6126000	Pete Jousting to my mother this morning
6126000	6128000	Right, remember I was explaining
6128000	6130000	You brought it up
6130000	6132000	Yeah there's a very
6132000	6134000	Like
6134000	6136000	You're either
6136000	6138000	Someone that doesn't mind peeps or will eat them
6138000	6140000	Or you think they're the most vile
6140000	6142000	Fucking candy on the base of the earth
6142000	6144000	Yeah so we
6144000	6146000	Brought up peeps at this
6146000	6148000	Easter breakfast and
6148000	6150000	Rob's mom and I think
6150000	6152000	Aunt
6152000	6154000	You say the two relatives were like
6154000	6156000	Peeps
6156000	6158000	Like cousin in law
6158000	6160000	So they were going through their whole
6160000	6162000	Peeps are gross rant and we mentioned
6162000	6164000	Peep Jousting
6164000	6166000	That was after my cousin's son
6166000	6168000	Who's 9 years old was threatening to
6168000	6170000	Look up the show on the internet so God I hope
6170000	6172000	He didn't find it
6172000	6174000	So you need to turn it off
6174000	6176000	Your mother's gonna
6176000	6178000	Mother's gonna kick your butt
6178000	6180000	I'm surprised that there wasn't
6180000	6182000	More bacon at the
6182000	6184000	Event
6184000	6186000	Let's not get into that
6186000	6188000	But yeah Peep Jousting I don't know
6188000	6190000	I haven't done Peep Jousting in a long time
6190000	6192000	What about the other part of the question
6192000	6194000	What's your favorite totally not kosher for passover
6194000	6196000	Easter candy
6196000	6198000	The problem with that is that
6198000	6200000	Candy would be okay as long as it's not
6200000	6202000	Made with flour
6202000	6204000	You know like something with a crust
6204000	6206000	Pocky
6206000	6208000	Yeah you could have Pocky
6208000	6210000	But I don't really think of Pocky as
6210000	6212000	Easter
6212000	6214000	My favorite Easter candy
6214000	6216000	Would be jelly beans that aren't
6216000	6218000	Jelly belly like and I can only
6218000	6220000	Really eat them around Easter because
6220000	6222000	I can't eat them everyday
6222000	6224000	You don't like the gelatin stuff
6224000	6226000	Anyway you can't really eat that stuff but I like
6226000	6228000	Regular jelly beans especially the black ones
6228000	6230000	That are just pure licorice
6230000	6232000	Barf black licorice barf
6232000	6234000	Barf
6234000	6236000	I'll pick the black ones out of whatever
6236000	6238000	You can't have milk chocolate while you're
6238000	6240000	Having fried chicken
6240000	6242000	But I can really only eat them at Easter time
6242000	6244000	I can't eat them other time of the year
6244000	6246000	Jelly belly is the rest of the year
6246000	6248000	Is all I can eat
6248000	6250000	Now I'm imagining chocolate covered
6250000	6252000	Chicken and that would just be gross
6252000	6254000	Go to any state fair in the south
6254000	6256000	Well you're from the south you know
6256000	6258000	It would be chocolate covered chicken deep fried
6258000	6260000	In like bacon fat
6260000	6262000	Ew
6262000	6264000	Alright we got some other uh
6264000	6266000	Oh I will tell you one thing
6266000	6268000	My friend made bacon brownies
6268000	6270000	I see that
6270000	6272000	I told her that when all this is over
6272000	6274000	She used to make me some turkey bacon brownies
6274000	6276000	Uh what about you? So I just popped
6276000	6278000	Favorite Easter candy?
6278000	6280000	Uh the Reese's peanut butter cup eggs
6280000	6282000	Just cause it's just a big flat
6282000	6284000	Peanut butter cup and those are amazing
6284000	6286000	You know what I don't like are cream eggs
6286000	6288000	Gross
6288000	6290000	People worship those things but they are too
6290000	6292000	Much they are too much
6292000	6294000	The mini they have those mini
6294000	6296000	Cream eggs now those I can eat
6296000	6298000	Touch of Britain sells Mars eggs
6298000	6300000	Marzipan?
6300000	6302000	No Mars bars eggs
6302000	6304000	And they also have um these uh
6304000	6306000	Dark chocolate truffle eggs
6306000	6308000	Cause there are all kind of cream eggs
6308000	6310000	Sold you know in England and these
6310000	6312000	Are just they're all Cadbury
6312000	6314000	The ones that they carry they also have the um
6314000	6316000	The
6316000	6318000	Galaxy ones
6318000	6320000	They sell those too and the arrow ones
6320000	6322000	They're all puffed air chocolate eggs
6322000	6324000	So good anyway I need to go get my
6324000	6326000	Mars egg let me get some more tweets
6326000	6328000	Flaming toilet is tweeting us
6328000	6330000	Upgrading to a new swim swim
6330000	6332000	A new slim PlayStation 3
6332000	6334000	And tired of waiting for PSN to come
6334000	6336000	Back is it okay to do
6336000	6338000	Data transfer utility or do I
6338000	6340000	Risk losing data?
6340000	6342000	I don't know I have no idea
6342000	6344000	Data transfer between his old
6344000	6346000	System and his new one? That's what I'm assuming
6346000	6348000	Okay uh like kind of like a license
6348000	6350000	Transfer I'm assuming like what you do on 360
6350000	6352000	I've never had to do that before uh
6352000	6354000	I wouldn't risk it like honestly
6354000	6356000	Right now not a good time to try that cause it
6356000	6358000	Depending on when
6358000	6360000	His slim was
6360000	6362000	Manufactured and put on the shelves
6362000	6364000	He's probably a few OS
6364000	6366000	Updates behind and that
6366000	6368000	Once he actually gets the slim
6368000	6370000	Online it's like oh we need to update you to
6370000	6372000	Point six I don't know what number they're on
6372000	6374000	And that might invalidate his certificates
6374000	6376000	So just wait
6376000	6378000	Good point yeah you're gonna have to wait it out sorry
6378000	6380000	Uh and let's see
6380000	6382000	One more tweet from TigerCloth305
6382000	6384000	On Twitter says it's a tweet
6384000	6386000	The DS Lite is going to be discontinued
6386000	6388000	Uh yeah that was some news
6388000	6390000	That was circulating this week is that the DS Lite
6390000	6392000	Is no more and he's linking
6392000	6394000	Us to a story on oneup.com
6394000	6396000	That apparently references a NeoGaf post
6396000	6398000	Where there is documents going out
6398000	6400000	Uh Nintendo is not offering
6400000	6402000	Any comment on this right now
6402000	6404000	But I guess some of the older DS's are
6404000	6406000	Being discontinued which makes sense I mean
6406000	6408000	Well I think every person
6408000	6410000	In the developed world
6410000	6412000	Has one
6412000	6414000	Including their pets
6414000	6416000	Like my cat has a DS Lite I'm kidding
6416000	6418000	But no I think yeah that's
6418000	6420000	They're pretty um
6420000	6422000	Prevalent
6422000	6424000	Yeah and they're not getting
6424000	6426000	Rid of the DSi or the
6426000	6428000	DS XL that's important to know
6428000	6430000	And I still want one of those too but yeah
6430000	6432000	So there's no why why not just get the 3DS
6432000	6434000	I don't know those screens are big
6434000	6436000	It's well the 3DS is backwards compatible
6436000	6438000	With the regular DS right
6438000	6440000	But not the advanced games
6440000	6442000	So you like must play Game Boy advanced games
6442000	6444000	Well they haven't had the GBA port on the DS
6444000	6446000	In a while oh that's right they got rid of
6446000	6448000	That with the DSi yeah so I guess that's the
6448000	6450000	One thing you're losing with the DS Lite
6450000	6452000	No more Game Boy advanced games
6452000	6454000	So there you go
6454000	6456000	Let's see one more tweet
6456000	6458000	Tigerclaw got in one more and why not
6458000	6460000	I'll go ahead and read this one
6460000	6462000	Chrono Trigger apparently is
6462000	6464000	Also coming out so I guess this is in the same
6464000	6466000	Vain as the Final Fantasy 6 thing we heard about earlier
6466000	6468000	Apparently Chrono Trigger for the
6468000	6470000	PlayStation 3 and PSP
6470000	6472000	Was outed by an ESRB listing
6472000	6474000	So this is probably just right in that
6474000	6476000	Up the same alley as Final Fantasy 6
6476000	6478000	Because Chrono Trigger was released for the
6478000	6480000	PlayStation 1
6480000	6482000	Yeah so this is yeah the
6482000	6484000	What was that called was it the Final Fantasy
6484000	6486000	Chronicles that had Chrono Trigger in it?
6486000	6488000	Chronicles yeah the other one was the Anthology
6488000	6490000	Yeah so um
6490000	6492000	It's probably just obviously a port of that
6492000	6494000	Because that's already been out on Sony the
6494000	6496000	DS port with the extra
6496000	6498000	Dungeon and the endings and stuff
6498000	6500000	Is probably still the better
6500000	6502000	Chrono Trigger
6502000	6504000	Release that you'd want to
6504000	6506000	Get rather than this one but
6506000	6508000	Give us a legit Chrono Trigger sequel already
6508000	6510000	Like I know there's Chrono Cross but I mean
6510000	6512000	Seriously how long ago was that?
6512000	6514000	Damn Square
6514000	6516000	Everybody loses their shit
6516000	6518000	Over that game and yet we still don't have
6518000	6520000	Like something in that canon
6520000	6522000	It's weird one of the reasons why I still
6522000	6524000	Want a DS XL is because
6524000	6526000	Chrono Trigger
6526000	6528000	Port on the DS
6528000	6530000	I can see it fine it's not like I'm blind but
6530000	6532000	Just those sprites I want them on a bigger screen
6532000	6534000	So fair enough
6534000	6536000	Alright let's move on with some more
6536000	6538000	Gaming news and then we're gonna get to your
6538000	6540000	Phone calls before too long and emails
6540000	6542000	We have lots of emails tonight can't wait to do that
6542000	6544000	Dark Soccer's gotta work tonight
6544000	6546000	Yay alright
6546000	6548000	Slaces pop more news
6548000	6550000	So after that
6550000	6552000	A couple weeks ago we
6552000	6554000	Announced that the Mega Man
6554000	6556000	Project that Capcom was working on
6556000	6558000	Was scrapped but they're still
6558000	6560000	From what we understand working on Mega Man
6560000	6562000	Legends 3 that has a huge
6562000	6564000	Fandom that really wants that game to come out
6564000	6566000	The Capcom
6566000	6568000	Has announced that they are putting out
6568000	6570000	A Mega Man Legends 3
6570000	6572000	Prototype version which is
6572000	6574000	Sort of a beta
6574000	6576000	Slash demo it's
6576000	6578000	I'm not sure if it's gonna have a full
6578000	6580000	Start to finish or it's a separate episode
6580000	6582000	That may not necessarily be in the full release of the game
6582000	6584000	But it's just
6584000	6586000	What they have compiled that runs
6586000	6588000	Well they're gonna put it out
6588000	6590000	For the 3DS
6590000	6592000	And on their eShop
6592000	6594000	It's supposed to hit in late May
6594000	6596000	And there's a playable
6596000	6598000	Character named Barrett
6598000	6600000	And it offers a few missions
6600000	6602000	Not to be confused with the first person ever to
6602000	6604000	Say shit in Final Fantasy
6604000	6606000	Just so you know
6606000	6608000	So you play as Barrett and it's gonna have a few missions
6608000	6610000	Though it's probably gonna be spammed
6610000	6612000	With loading screen messages
6612000	6614000	That just say this is not a finished product
6614000	6616000	This is a game in progress any bugs blah blah blah
6616000	6618000	So yeah we're gonna get
6618000	6620000	Something for Legends 3
6620000	6622000	But yet you're gonna have to pay for it right?
6622000	6624000	Let's see
6624000	6626000	Quickly let me throw this out here
6626000	6628000	It's going on the eShop
6628000	6630000	Let me throw this out here to a little follow up to that
6630000	6632000	Is that you know I guess Capcom isn't
6632000	6634000	Really sold on this whole thing
6634000	6636000	So they are saying that we need
6636000	6638000	Interest we need participation
6638000	6640000	From fans or this game could be axed
6640000	6642000	At any second like for some reason
6642000	6644000	I'm just reminded of like when Tinkerbell
6644000	6646000	Is dying clap if you want
6646000	6648000	To save me just clap clap louder
6648000	6650000	Clap louder and say I believe in fairies
6650000	6652000	I believe in fairies that's that's literally what
6652000	6654000	Capcom is saying you need to clap
6654000	6656000	And say I believe in Mega Man
6656000	6658000	I believe in Mega Man and then give us your money
6658000	6660000	Is basically what they're saying so
6660000	6662000	They have come out and said in a blog post
6662000	6664000	On Capcom Unity Masakazu
6664000	6666000	Eguchi the director of the game
6666000	6668000	Said the prototype version that's coming out
6668000	6670000	On the 3DS is based
6670000	6672000	On the prototype that they made
6672000	6674000	To prove to Capcom that the game could
6674000	6676000	Happen the heat and excitement surrounding
6676000	6678000	This downloadable title would determine
6678000	6680000	Whether or not the full game could be greenlit
6680000	6682000	If hype is strong the full title
6682000	6684000	Will be a go if not
6684000	6686000	It's a no go
6686000	6688000	Clap clap I'm dying
6688000	6690000	I believe in fairies I believe
6690000	6692000	This doesn't mention if there's
6692000	6694000	Going to be MSRP
6696000	6698000	Extra Mega Man costume $2
6698000	6700000	So if you want
6700000	6702000	Legends 3 if this thing
6702000	6704000	Costs money and it's basically a glorified
6704000	6706000	Beta that's kind of lame
6706000	6708000	Yeah pick it up
6708000	6710000	They're tracking heavily the response to this
6710000	6712000	So now not only do we have pay to unlock
6712000	6714000	Content but we have pay demos
6714000	6716000	Pay to finish developing
6718000	6720000	You want us to fix those
6720000	6722000	Clipping issues or you know
6722000	6724000	The game crashes if you try to
6724000	6726000	Walk backwards you know
6726000	6728000	Slip a little
6728000	6730000	Like a 20 we'll figure it out
6730000	6732000	Alright
6732000	6734000	Well I guess to be fair the
6734000	6736000	Gran Turismo 5 prologue
6736000	6738000	Was kind of the same thing
6738000	6740000	It kind of sounds like where this is going except we always knew
6740000	6742000	There would be a Gran Turismo 5 eventually
6742000	6744000	Although was Bobby ever
6744000	6746000	Convinced that Gran Turismo 5 came out?
6746000	6748000	I'm not sure hopefully he's in chat and can let us know
6748000	6750000	Anyway a follow up to a story from a couple weeks ago
6750000	6752000	I remember when there was that awesome Streets of Rage
6752000	6754000	Remake that they've been like making for like 8
6754000	6756000	Years and they put it out on the internet and we were
6756000	6758000	Talking about it how like hey they finally get
6758000	6760000	To put out the Streets of Rage remake you remember that
6760000	6762000	Dark Sakura? Yeah
6762000	6764000	Dark Sakura updated graphics well guess how long that
6764000	6766000	Lasted? 5 seconds
6766000	6768000	That's right the link
6768000	6770000	Was taken down of course
6770000	6772000	Now that it's out on the internet it's not that hard to
6772000	6774000	Find but the official link was taken down
6774000	6776000	And after some proking and prodding they did
6776000	6778000	Admit Sega has contacted
6778000	6780000	Regarding the download hosted on this site
6780000	6782000	While this issue is being resolved
6782000	6784000	Please do not upload the game for others to download
6784000	6786000	Right any links posted on
6786000	6788000	This site will be removed thank you
6788000	6790000	Now apparently they were kind of
6790000	6792000	Asked well didn't you like try to get this cleared with
6792000	6794000	Sega or what's going on?
6794000	6796000	Bomberlink who's the project leader on the progress
6796000	6798000	Said they did contact Sega
6798000	6800000	I would like to say this is a quote from him
6800000	6802000	I would like to say that we did actually
6802000	6804000	Contact Sega last year through an email message
6804000	6806000	Regarding the use of copyrighted material
6806000	6808000	To which they answered asking us to send
6808000	6810000	A formal letter to their legal department
6810000	6812000	So that's what we did we accepted the ESA
6812000	6814000	Policies regarding the DMCA as well
6814000	6816000	Otherwise this website would not exist
6816000	6818000	Anymore
6818000	6820000	There you go
6820000	6822000	They had to take it down cause Sega didn't like it
6822000	6824000	Eight years that thing was in the making
6824000	6826000	And you know Sega is just trying to really
6826000	6828000	Utilize that Streets of Rage license
6828000	6830000	Right now it's a big IP for them
6830000	6832000	A part of you know trademark
6832000	6834000	Law is you have to pursue
6834000	6836000	Every infraction against
6836000	6838000	Your brand even if you're not doing anything
6838000	6840000	With it or else you could lose
6840000	6842000	The trademark to be fair
6842000	6844000	Because I'm sure someone in chat will bring it up
6844000	6846000	They have released the Streets of Rage 2
6846000	6848000	Something on the iPhone, iPad
6848000	6850000	So they are still trying to cash in on
6850000	6852000	Genesis nostalgia as they have for the past
6852000	6854000	15 years on various
6854000	6856000	You know consoles and Streets of Rage was in that
6856000	6858000	Awesome like the best Genesis nostalgia
6858000	6860000	Of them all that Sonic Omega collection
6860000	6862000	Thing that was on PS3 that's super
6862000	6864000	Cheap and Xbox
6864000	6866000	So yeah this isn't unfortunate to hear because
6866000	6868000	The community obviously really cares about it
6868000	6870000	And have to take eight years to put this out
6870000	6872000	But the fact that they were C&D'd is
6872000	6874000	Sort of I know seems like a duh
6874000	6876000	But do we mention
6876000	6878000	About the whole Sega building in San Francisco
6878000	6880000	Now belongs to Zynga
6880000	6882000	We did bring that up on the show huh
6882000	6884000	Speaking of sad stories
6884000	6886000	Sad sad stories
6886000	6888000	I didn't know Zynga owned
6888000	6890000	Words With Friends now either
6890000	6892000	Zynga's the
6892000	6894000	I stopped playing Words With Friends you know why
6894000	6896000	Because everybody wants to fucking play Words With Friends
6896000	6898000	And then it's like my phone keeps going off
6898000	6900000	Every two seconds
6900000	6902000	Your move with Dark Sakura
6902000	6905000	Random people you didn't know right
6905000	6907000	Were trying to start new games with you
6907000	6909000	Fuck Words With Friends
6909000	6911000	It's a terrible game
6911000	6913000	Yeah I said it
6913000	6915000	Get a Scrabble board you'll have more fun
6915000	6917000	Then you can yell at somebody in person
6917000	6919000	It's much more satisfying
6919000	6921000	Rather than Words With Friends play out
6921000	6923000	Everybody fucking cheats at Words With Friends anyway
6923000	6925000	You know there's an app that you can actually buy
6927000	6929000	One of my managers at work was showing me
6929000	6931000	How to do this by the way
6931000	6933000	A screenshot of the screen from Words With Friends
6933000	6935000	And then upload it to this other app
6935000	6937000	And it just cheats
6937000	6939000	When I was playing a lot of Yahoo
6939000	6941000	Literati
6941000	6943000	There was a JavaScript
6943000	6945000	Website that was in Anagram Finder
6945000	6947000	Where you would put in your
6947000	6949000	Yahoo Literati URL and it would say
6949000	6951000	Oh here's your word
6951000	6953000	You're a cheater?
6953000	6955000	You are a cheater?
6955000	6957000	You cheated on Yahoo Literati?
6957000	6959000	You're going to hell
6959000	6961000	I can however say that
6961000	6963000	I have not cheated at Scrabulous
6963000	6965000	I miss Scrabulous
6965000	6967000	What's Scrabulous?
6967000	6969000	Scrabulous became Lexulous because
6969000	6971000	Scrabble or whatever
6971000	6973000	Is that on Facebook?
6973000	6975000	Ah fuck that game too
6975000	6977000	Well I don't play it on Facebook
6977000	6979000	But I used to play it when it was Scrabulous
6979000	6981000	And it had Scrabble Solitaire
6981000	6983000	Now it's like it makes you play with people
6983000	6985000	And I hate that because Scrabble Solitaire is super fun
6985000	6987000	Where basically you just play until you're out of words
6987000	6989000	That's your score
6989000	6991000	Are there any fun Facebook games right now?
6991000	6993000	I've been going in and deleting
6993000	6995000	Just about all of my apps
6995000	6997000	There's seriously nothing I play on Facebook
6997000	6999000	I got sick of Knights of the Clicky
6999000	7001000	I'm sure I have like 4 trillion blood points in Vampire Wars
7001000	7003000	That I haven't touched in 3 years
7003000	7005000	Knights of the Clicky haven't touched in 2 and a half, 3 months
7005000	7007000	I deleted it
7007000	7009000	I've deleted almost all of my games
7009000	7011000	I want to play the Civ game
7011000	7013000	That was the only thing I was interested in
7013000	7015000	Does that come out? I don't even remember
7015000	7017000	And then there's some
7017000	7019000	Supposedly, and it's a story that didn't make our show roll tonight
7019000	7021000	But some music game is out on Facebook too
7021000	7023000	That I need to check out for next week
7023000	7025000	Something that was posted in our thread
7025000	7027000	About like a Facebook game, but I wanted to actually play it
7027000	7029000	Before bringing it up on the show
7029000	7031000	But apparently there's that too
7031000	7033000	So, alright
7033000	7035000	Cassandra in our chat room says
7035000	7037000	Scrabulous sounds like a Decepticon name
7037000	7039000	I like that
7039000	7041000	Alright, let's move on
7041000	7043000	DarkSakura, what do you got for us?
7043000	7045000	Well, there is
7045000	7047000	An Activision memo that was linked
7047000	7049000	That says there is no
7049000	7051000	Appetite for Guitar Hero
7051000	7053000	Aww
7053000	7055000	It actually was saying is that
7055000	7057000	But there is an appetite for destruction
7057000	7059000	And there's also an
7059000	7061000	Aperitif for destruction
7061000	7063000	If you like, lounge against the machine
7063000	7065000	Anyway
7065000	7067000	Basically
7067000	7069000	The whole thing that they're saying is that
7069000	7071000	Yeah, right now it's dead
7071000	7073000	But it should
7073000	7075000	Eventually come back up
7075000	7077000	They're asking
7077000	7079000	The CEO Eric
7079000	7081000	Hirschberg said
7081000	7083000	Why are we walking away from Guitar Hero
7083000	7085000	Instead of just trying to reinvent it
7085000	7087000	And that basically it's because
7087000	7089000	There are so many
7089000	7091000	High quality games that are just
7091000	7093000	Saturating the market
7093000	7095000	Wasn't this what we were saying before?
7095000	7097000	Is that the market was just way too saturated?
7097000	7099000	Well, they're like, oh, duh
7099000	7101000	That's what we were doing wrong
7101000	7103000	So
7103000	7105000	They're sort of
7105000	7107000	Setting it aside for now
7107000	7109000	In fact, it actually says that they are
7109000	7111000	Perhaps after a cooling period
7111000	7113000	We will revisit the franchise with fresh innovation
7113000	7115000	They're gonna wait for people to go
7115000	7117000	Remember when Guitar Hero was cool
7117000	7119000	And then Activision will be right there
7119000	7121000	To say, hey, we still own the rights to this
7121000	7123000	Hey, there's a whole new Guitar Hero game for you to play
7123000	7125000	Haha
7125000	7127000	It's retro Guitar Hero
7127000	7129000	Meanwhile, Rock Band's like, we've been out here and we're still cool
7129000	7131000	Hi, we're still cool
7131000	7133000	Hi, we're really cool
7133000	7135000	We've attached
7135000	7137000	The clarinet attachment
7137000	7139000	Although I do, I even feel like the Rock Band
7139000	7141000	Thing has really died down
7141000	7143000	It's really died down
7143000	7145000	It's kinda sad
7145000	7147000	We were just playing the other day
7147000	7149000	The cousins were over when we were playing
7149000	7151000	SSJ100 Matt in our chat room says
7151000	7153000	Notice how no one ever asked these questions when
7153000	7155000	DDR died, in Konami that is
7155000	7157000	Well, technically DDR is
7157000	7159000	Still not dead
7159000	7161000	I mean, they are still cranking out those games
7161000	7163000	Like, wow, there's an Xbox 360
7163000	7165000	One coming out, the port of the
7165000	7167000	PlayStation 3 one is coming on the Xbox
7167000	7169000	360 and you guys, it uses the
7169000	7171000	Xbox Live Vision camera
7171000	7173000	That's how hip Konami is
7173000	7175000	The little webcam
7175000	7177000	Not the Kinect, but the little
7177000	7179000	AOL-looking thing
7179000	7181000	We'll use that, apparently
7181000	7183000	I hope to God for Konami's
7183000	7185000	Sake, the Kinect will stand in
7185000	7187000	For that, because the Kinect's
7187000	7189000	Basically a camera too, but
7189000	7191000	I think the 360 only has the
7191000	7193000	One I.O. USB port in the back
7193000	7195000	For goodies, so you'd have to
7195000	7197000	Unplug your Kinect to plug in the little webcam
7197000	7199000	That's not gonna happen
7199000	7201000	And if seriously
7201000	7203000	It only works with that little camera
7203000	7205000	And it doesn't work with Kinect, then everyone point and laugh
7205000	7207000	At Konami
7207000	7209000	Anyhow
7209000	7211000	Oh yeah, Guitar Hero, yeah
7211000	7213000	Well, someday it'll come out
7213000	7215000	It's being cryogenically frozen for a later date
7215000	7217000	So that they can bust it out in the future
7217000	7219000	To save humanity
7219000	7221000	It's next to Walt Disney's head
7221000	7223000	Alright
7223000	7225000	Moving on, so let's just pop
7225000	7227000	There was a story that we reported
7227000	7229000	On a few weeks ago about
7229000	7231000	Ratings tampering on the
7231000	7233000	Indie marketplace on the
7233000	7235000	XBLA
7235000	7237000	And some indie games
7237000	7239000	That had anywhere from three to five star reviews
7239000	7241000	Were getting hundreds
7241000	7243000	Of one star reviews
7243000	7245000	Within a short amount of time that was throwing
7245000	7247000	Their game listing
7247000	7249000	And their rankings down
7249000	7251000	Into the toilet so they weren't getting as much
7251000	7253000	Exposure as they would otherwise
7253000	7255000	If they had their four star review
7255000	7257000	So, Microsoft decided
7257000	7259000	To come up with a fix to this
7259000	7261000	And they have decided that
7261000	7263000	In order to
7263000	7265000	Rate an indie game, you need to
7265000	7267000	Have a gold account, which means you are
7267000	7269000	Paying Microsoft
7269000	7271000	For the Xbox Gold
7271000	7273000	Live services, if you are a free or
7273000	7275000	Silver member, you cannot give
7275000	7277000	A rating to a game
7277000	7279000	An indie game
7279000	7281000	That's good, because it was probably a bunch of
7281000	7283000	Sock-free accounts that were doing this anyway
7283000	7285000	This story that I looked up
7285000	7287000	Also references a previous story
7287000	7289000	When the manipulation was first discovered
7289000	7291000	About a
7291000	7293000	Firm that had posted
7293000	7295000	To a contractor
7295000	7297000	Job site
7297000	7299000	Basically saying, we need someone
7299000	7301000	That can write a script that will generate
7301000	7303000	5,000 free silver
7303000	7305000	Accounts
7305000	7307000	They were looking for a coder that's like, can we run this
7307000	7309000	Overnight and just get the username spit out to us
7309000	7311000	Doesn't necessarily say
7311000	7313000	Why they wanted those 5,000
7313000	7315000	Accounts or if it's even related to
7315000	7317000	This
7317000	7319000	Rating manipulation, but just as a coincidence
7319000	7321000	There are firms out there that are like
7321000	7323000	We want
7323000	7325000	Wow, if I was Microsoft
7325000	7327000	I would be bringing the smackdown
7327000	7329000	On these firms for abusing their network
7329000	7331000	Yeah, I guess it was a
7331000	7333000	Graphic design firm contract
7333000	7335000	Script for 5,000 Xbox Live
7335000	7337000	Silver accounts
7337000	7339000	Again, don't know for sure, but the fact that
7339000	7341000	The interest for that is there
7341000	7343000	Microsoft's like, if you have a free account
7343000	7345000	You don't get to rate on indie games
7345000	7347000	Which, I guess, makes sense
7347000	7349000	That sucks that you have to pay, but it will
7349000	7351000	If you have a
7351000	7353000	Gold account, they can take action
7353000	7355000	Against you, they can ban your credit
7355000	7357000	Card, they can ban your account
7357000	7359000	You lose your gamer tag, you lose your achievement points
7359000	7361000	Why didn't they just
7361000	7363000	Make it so you have to actually play the game for 10 minutes
7363000	7365000	To rate? I mean, is that
7365000	7367000	So hard? I don't know
7367000	7369000	I guess that's hard to do
7369000	7371000	It's easy to build something to shut it off after 4 minutes
7371000	7373000	Oh, demo over 4 minutes, clank, buy
7373000	7375000	Or get out
7375000	7377000	Can you buy indie games a la carte with a silver or do you need gold
7377000	7379000	In order to even buy stuff on there
7379000	7381000	You can buy a la carte with silver
7381000	7383000	Yeah, I don't see why they would shove
7383000	7385000	It's money, why would you shut off a money maker?
7385000	7387000	I'm pretty sure
7387000	7389000	So, uh, and Randy
7389000	7391000	In our chatroom at chat.orangetonsrated.com
7391000	7393000	Agrees with me, they should make it so that you have to
7393000	7395000	Actually play a game for a set amount of time to rate it
7395000	7397000	That way people have to go out of their way to be jerks
7397000	7399000	At the same time, though, what's
7399000	7401000	To stop somebody from building a script that signs
7401000	7403000	In 5000 Xbox Live users into
7403000	7405000	A game? I mean, it's possible
7405000	7407000	A botting thing could do it
7407000	7409000	Sad but true, somebody would figure it out
7409000	7411000	Yeah, I
7411000	7413000	I agree that you should
7413000	7415000	Be able to
7415000	7417000	Have to play the game before you can rate it
7417000	7419000	But at the same time
7419000	7421000	If I play a demo that is so
7421000	7423000	Bad
7423000	7425000	And I want to be able to warn people
7425000	7427000	That this demo was horrible
7427000	7429000	Like that maze with balloons?
7429000	7431000	Yeah, I'm not gonna
7431000	7433000	Pay the 300 space bucks
7433000	7435000	I think people should
7435000	7437000	Download maze with balloons
7437000	7439000	Just to see how freaking bad it is
7439000	7441000	It is like an old, you know what
7441000	7443000	Maze with balloons reminds me of?
7443000	7445000	An old CD-ROM game from when that technology
7445000	7447000	First came out and people were like
7447000	7449000	Let's put softcore porn out
7449000	7451000	And try to make a game out of it
7451000	7453000	I'm thinking of the slumber party game
7453000	7455000	That that one girl was in from the
7455000	7457000	Night Trap
7457000	7459000	Yeah, it's like that
7459000	7461000	Exactly
7461000	7463000	Alright, anyhow
7463000	7465000	Let's move on to one other story
7465000	7467000	And I've kind of brought this up before
7467000	7469000	So this is a bit of a duh
7469000	7471000	But Super Mario 3DS, of course it is going to be
7471000	7473000	Announced at E3
7473000	7475000	Well, I mean, I guess it was announced
7475000	7477000	Quote-unquote at Game Developers Conference
7477000	7479000	But we're gonna get the official details
7479000	7481000	I guess you could say at E3
7481000	7483000	Apparently, though, according to an interview with
7483000	7485000	Edge, Miyamoto has leaked out a few details
7485000	7487000	On this
7487000	7489000	It's gonna have a combination of Super Mario Galaxy
7489000	7491000	And Super Mario 64
7491000	7493000	Two games that's still completely original
7493000	7495000	Perhaps that's because of the tanooki
7495000	7497000	Or the raccoon suit, which we haven't seen in any
7497000	7499000	Of those other games
7499000	7501000	That could be part of it as well
7501000	7503000	Or maybe it'll just be kind of a mechanic about the story
7503000	7505000	Of the game or how it all kind of plays together
7505000	7507000	Maybe instead of, I would like to see this
7507000	7509000	In a Mario game, maybe I'm just, maybe a pipe dream
7509000	7511000	But a bump
7511000	7513000	But instead of all these broken up worlds
7513000	7515000	What about one massive world?
7515000	7517000	I'd like to see a Mario game like that
7517000	7519000	Yeah, like a sandbox Mario game
7519000	7521000	That'd be awesome, actually
7521000	7523000	Imagine if the warp zones actually took you
7523000	7525000	Places to other parts of this one giant world
7525000	7527000	Instead of a heavily fragmented
7527000	7529000	You know, now you're on Bee Planet
7529000	7531000	Now you're on Candy Planet
7531000	7533000	I think that there should be, you know, things you have to do
7533000	7535000	To unlock different areas
7535000	7537000	Sure, just like any good Metroidvania
7537000	7539000	Type of game
7539000	7541000	You have to get an item to get behind the door
7541000	7543000	I would like to see that in a Mario game
7543000	7545000	That would be pretty awesome
7545000	7547000	That would be very awesome, we'll see what happens
7547000	7549000	Let's see, Redertainment in our chatroom
7549000	7551000	I want to read this comment too, speaking of the whole demos
7551000	7553000	And down ranking, chat.orangetownsradio.com
7553000	7555000	Is of course where our chatroom is
7555000	7557000	Redertainment says, if you want to warn people that a demo
7557000	7559000	Sucks, I'm sure you have a Twitter account
7559000	7561000	You can bitch on that reaches more people
7561000	7563000	Than that downloaded that indie title
7565000	7567000	And Randy says that Grand Theft Mario reminds him
7567000	7569000	Of something that happened in Robot Chicken
7569000	7571000	I haven't seen
7571000	7573000	Every episode of Robot Chicken, so I guess that went over my head
7573000	7575000	Oops, I did see
7575000	7577000	The Final Fantasy VII fast food
7577000	7579000	That was great
7579000	7581000	Alright, let's get to the emails
7581000	7583000	Every week you guys send us emails
7583000	7585000	At mailbag.orangetownsradio.com
7585000	7587000	The mailbag has been rather thin the past few weeks
7587000	7589000	So I'm really happy that this week you guys
7589000	7591000	Have fucking blown it up
7591000	7593000	Dark Soccer is going to work tonight
7593000	7595000	Well, we got a request
7595000	7597000	From
7597000	7599000	Ronnie
7599000	7601000	For an autograph
7601000	7603000	With an address, this is a five year listener
7603000	7605000	So I figured I was going to find
7605000	7607000	A postcard that I have
7607000	7609000	And we could just sign it and then put it in an envelope and send it
7609000	7611000	So I have one that says Juicyful
7611000	7613000	And it's orange
7613000	7615000	Either that or I was going to use the congratulations on your Bar Mitzvah
7615000	7617000	Card
7617000	7619000	That I got at the dollar store
7619000	7621000	For any upcoming Bar Mitzvah
7621000	7623000	Because there's a lot of kids
7623000	7625000	And I was like, no I better save that for an actual
7625000	7627000	Bar Mitzvah
7627000	7629000	So yeah, I set this aside
7629000	7631000	And we'll get everyone to sign it
7631000	7633000	So I mean, SalaciousPop I'm sure
7633000	7635000	Would not, his autograph would not
7635000	7637000	Go unappreciated, but I'm sure somebody wants
7637000	7639000	A complete trifecta of official OLR hosts
7639000	7641000	Yeah, so
7641000	7643000	I just need to make sure that
7643000	7645000	I mark the right one
7645000	7647000	Yeah, don't click delete
7647000	7649000	I'm not deleting it
7649000	7651000	There, it's this one, so I will
7651000	7653000	Do unread, there we go
7653000	7655000	And moving forward
7655000	7657000	This is from
7657000	7659000	Holly D. Hey guys
7659000	7661000	I swear your email was the above
7661000	7663000	But I recently heard you say mailbag at OrangeLaundryRadio.com
7663000	7665000	Is the Gmail
7665000	7667000	One an old email or something?
7667000	7669000	I don't know, do we have a Gmail?
7669000	7671000	Do we have a Gmail? If we do
7671000	7673000	What's the
7673000	7675000	Sender's name? Holly
7675000	7677000	Is that the Holly that writes it to Hordhouse?
7677000	7679000	Oh, it's probably the same Holly from Hordhouse
7679000	7681000	That is a Gmail account
7681000	7683000	Yeah, that is a Gmail account
7683000	7685000	The email for Hordhouse is
7685000	7687000	HordhousePodcast at Gmail.com
7687000	7689000	OrangeLaundryRadio is mailbag at OrangeLaundryRadio.com
7689000	7691000	I want to see if
7691000	7693000	Maybe somebody's swiped it
7693000	7695000	I don't know, let me look
7695000	7697000	So anywho, just wanted to confirm because I sent a couple of emails
7697000	7699000	And I thought it was weird that Sucker kept saying you only had one or two emails
7699000	7701000	Maybe other people are confused like me
7701000	7703000	Thanks
7703000	7705000	Yeah, it's
7705000	7707000	You sent it to the right one now
7707000	7709000	So it's mailbag at OrangeLaundryRadio.com
7709000	7711000	Okay, hey
7711000	7713000	OLR crew
7713000	7715000	AZHP here
7715000	7717000	So if anyone at OLR has played the PS2 game
7717000	7719000	Shin Megami Tensei Persona 4
7719000	7721000	But I wanted to share
7721000	7723000	The gaming related project that I've decided to take upon myself
7723000	7725000	Persona 4 takes place in the year 2011
7725000	7727000	From April 11th through the rest of the year
7727000	7729000	That being the case, I've taken it upon myself
7729000	7731000	To tweet the events of Persona 4
7731000	7733000	Roughly as they happen
7733000	7735000	It's just a very deep game with lots of relationships
7735000	7737000	Drama, mystery
7737000	7739000	And just lots of things to do in general
7739000	7741000	And I'll try to make it as interesting and funny
7741000	7743000	To follow along with as possible
7743000	7745000	The Twitter account is
7745000	7747000	NarukamiU
7747000	7751000	That's N-A-R-U-K-M-I-Y-U
7751000	7753000	NarukamiU being the name of
7753000	7755000	Being, let me start over
7755000	7757000	NarukamiU being the name
7757000	7759000	That the people developing the new Persona 4
7759000	7761000	Anime have given the originally nameless
7761000	7763000	Main character
7763000	7765000	I'm not looking to become some sort of D-list-y
7765000	7767000	Celebrity by doing this
7767000	7769000	But I do want people who would be appreciated
7769000	7771000	In this sort of project to know about it
7771000	7773000	If you spread the word on your show
7773000	7775000	I would be deeply honored
7775000	7777000	Again the Twitter account is at NarukamiU
7777000	7779000	Also happy birthday DarkSarka, thank you
7779000	7781000	Your birthday is just a few days before mine
7781000	7783000	And mine is the day before Wendell's
7783000	7785000	So yours was yesterday, well happy birthday
7785000	7787000	Keep up the great work
7787000	7789000	And thanks so much for helping me spread the word
7789000	7791000	AZHP, and also a very big happy birthday
7791000	7793000	To Mr. Wendell, thank you for reminding me to say so
7793000	7795000	Cause Wendell is one of our old school buddies
7795000	7797000	Happy birthday all y'all
7797000	7799000	And glad you got that plug worked out
7799000	7801000	He's old
7801000	7803000	I just wanted to follow up
7803000	7805000	It does look like there is an Orange Lounge Radio
7805000	7807000	Email account at Gmail
7807000	7809000	It is not us
7809000	7811000	I sent a password reset thing
7811000	7813000	So if it is one of us we'll get the email
7813000	7815000	But it's not in my email, it's not in my Orange Lounge Radio
7815000	7817000	It's not in the mailbag email
7817000	7819000	Somebody else could have signed up trying to impersonate us
7819000	7821000	I certainly suppose that's possible
7821000	7823000	Loki could have it too
7823000	7827000	He might have done that for the YouTube channel or something
7827000	7829000	But that's very possible
7829000	7831000	So one of us will have the reset email if it's ours
7831000	7833000	But as far as we know right now, we don't own it
7833000	7835000	I've got about six different emails and none of them are
7835000	7837000	And we don't write from that address
7837000	7839000	So if you do get something from OrangeLoungeRadio.com
7839000	7843000	Forward it to the official email of Orange Lounge Radio
7843000	7845000	Which is mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
7845000	7847000	So we can investigate
7847000	7849000	And other than that, we're probably going to have to send a notice
7849000	7851000	For them to strike it
7851000	7853000	It could be Loki
7853000	7855000	Loki could have done with the YouTube channel
7855000	7857000	So we'll have to ask him next week
7857000	7859000	Thanks for letting us know
7859000	7861000	Greetings, O.L.R. This week was torture without your podcast
7861000	7863000	Don't ever take another week off again
7863000	7865000	Even if Rob and Jamie have to go somewhere
7865000	7867000	I'll suck it up and just listen to Loki eat chicken
7867000	7869000	And complain about Nintendo for three hours
7869000	7871000	Which is exactly what it would be
7871000	7873000	Peace and chicken grease serious turtle
7873000	7875000	He's a very serious turtle
7875000	7877000	Seriously, you're not allowed to leave
7877000	7879000	Long email is long
7879000	7881000	I just want to point out
7881000	7883000	A lot of your favorite shows take all summer off
7883000	7887000	We take one week off every three months or so
7887000	7889000	I think it's okay if we miss four shows a year
7889000	7891000	We need a vacation sometimes
7891000	7893000	That's right
7893000	7895000	It felt really good to not have a show last week
7895000	7897000	I love doing the show
7897000	7899000	Don't get me wrong, but it was kind of nice to have Sunday night
7899000	7901000	To do something else
7901000	7903000	Usually when I take Sunday off
7903000	7905000	If it's not for family stuff
7905000	7907000	It's for doing something else for the show
7907000	7909000	I've gone to gaming conventions
7909000	7911000	And stuff called in and reported on it
7911000	7913000	And sometimes, honestly, I wish I was here instead of there
7913000	7915000	But, you know
7915000	7917000	Because this is my house
7917000	7919000	Okay
7919000	7921000	Hi, OLR, this is from Spazznator, by the way
7921000	7923000	I'm pretty sure that the three of you have covered the story
7923000	7925000	About PSN going down this week due to hackers
7925000	7927000	In part A of this week's show
7927000	7929000	So I won't bother rehashing the details
7929000	7931000	Rather, I'd like to do a Loki-style rant about it, if I may
7931000	7933000	While I'm not pissed at Sony
7933000	7935000	Hell, from what I can tell
7935000	7937000	They did what they needed to do
7937000	7939000	I am, however, extremely pissed off
7939000	7941000	Okay, dude, it's not hackers, okay
7941000	7943000	But I will read your rant, anyway
7943000	7945000	I am, however, EXTREMELY
7945000	7947000	PISSED OFF
7947000	7949000	At these fucktards that hacked PSN
7949000	7951000	Despite Sony not explicitly saying
7951000	7953000	Who it was that did it
7953000	7955000	I'm 100,000% sure
7955000	7957000	It was these anonymous dickwads that did it
7957000	7959000	After all, as the old saying goes
7959000	7961000	If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck
7961000	7963000	It must be a duck
7963000	7965000	Who the holy hell are they to do this
7965000	7967000	What the fuck gives them the right?
7967000	7969000	They're a small minority
7969000	7971000	Have other consoles to play online with
7971000	7973000	Yes, there are single player games as well
7973000	7975000	But that's besides the point
7975000	7977000	There are games such as
7977000	7979000	Mags, SOCOM, Confrontation Free Realms, DCUO, etc
7979000	7981000	That are multiplayer only
7981000	7983000	As well as a few Capcom titles
7983000	7985000	I.e. Final Fight Double Impact
7985000	7987000	And Bionic Commando Rearm 2
7987000	7989000	That require one to be logged into PSN to play
7989000	7991000	Hence, right now, they're unplayable
7991000	7993000	Many of those titles I play on a regular basis
7993000	7995000	And tend to love
7995000	7997000	Just over the fact that, for the time being
7997000	7999000	I can't access the PSN video store
7999000	8001000	To get either the freebies
8001000	8003000	And or paid content
8003000	8005000	And the three of you know how much I love that store
8005000	8007000	Hell, as is, I will never shut up about it
8007000	8009000	At any rate
8009000	8011000	When Sony finds these torps
8011000	8013000	And they will, it's just a matter of time
8013000	8015000	I hope they get the legal system on their punk asses
8015000	8017000	Like white on motherfucking rice
8017000	8019000	And, as Samuel Jackson so eloquently put it
8019000	8021000	Gets Medivial on their asses
8021000	8023000	May the hackers burn in a nuclear fire
8023000	8025000	Than drown an ocean of piss and acid
8025000	8027000	Slash end rants
8027000	8029000	It actually did exhales
8029000	8031000	But I exhaled
8031000	8033000	This rant is brought to you by one really pissed off PSN user
8033000	8035000	That wants to lay the smack down on some punks
8035000	8037000	By the way, your anger may be a little misdirected
8037000	8039000	Wait until it's resolved
8039000	8041000	An official word comes out
8041000	8043000	I kind of agree
8043000	8045000	With what you're saying, can I read this real quick from Bobby
8045000	8047000	In our chatroom too? DarkSakura
8047000	8049000	Yeah, I kept telling him it wasn't anonymous and he told me I was wrong
8049000	8051000	He told me it didn't matter what the truth was
8051000	8053000	I was going to blame Anon
8053000	8055000	See, Anon was very proud
8055000	8057000	To take credit for that first Sony attack
8057000	8059000	And that's the problem
8059000	8061000	Is that now that this is happening, I mean
8061000	8063000	This could be happening from somebody who's trying to get at Anonymous
8063000	8065000	For all we know
8065000	8067000	But Anonymous flat out said
8067000	8069000	We understand that this tactic
8069000	8071000	Only hurts the people we're trying to protect
8071000	8073000	We are not going to do it anymore
8073000	8075000	But
8075000	8077000	But because Anonymous has no leader
8077000	8079000	You know, it's not like
8079000	8081000	WikiLeaks who has that, whatever his name is
8081000	8083000	They've got a group that's
8083000	8085000	But there's no clear leader out there
8085000	8087000	And that's what's causing them
8087000	8089000	To look bad is because it could be
8089000	8091000	A subset that's doing it
8091000	8093000	Regardless
8093000	8095000	I don't think this is Anonymous
8095000	8097000	I think they may benefit from the notoriety
8097000	8099000	But
8099000	8101000	I don't think this is Anonymous
8101000	8103000	They flat out said
8103000	8105000	No, this is counter productive
8105000	8107000	To what we're trying to do
8107000	8109000	So don't
8109000	8111000	Don't look for a scapegoat, wait until they actually
8111000	8113000	Officially say what's going on, because I have a feeling
8113000	8115000	That it's actually one of those situations
8115000	8117000	Where, like, okay, at my work
8117000	8119000	We got an email out that said
8119000	8121000	This number of
8121000	8123000	People are affected
8123000	8125000	Because a laptop was stolen
8125000	8127000	Who hacked
8127000	8129000	The
8129000	8131000	Site that does all the
8131000	8133000	Email campaigns?
8133000	8135000	That happened about, what, two, three weeks ago
8135000	8137000	Do you remember the salacious pop? You read a lot of internet news
8137000	8139000	Somebody hacked, it wasn't Anonymous
8139000	8141000	It was somebody else hacked some
8141000	8143000	Spam, no, not spam, I'm sorry
8143000	8145000	They do, like, the email campaigns for all these various
8145000	8147000	Websites, and all
8147000	8149000	These websites that use this email
8149000	8151000	Service to maintain their mailing list and so forth had to
8151000	8153000	Write people, because I got some from a couple
8153000	8155000	Companies saying
8155000	8157000	Your personal information may have been breached
8157000	8159000	Your email and so forth, because we
8159000	8161000	Got hacked. Oh, are you talking about
8161000	8163000	The Gawker network, Kotaku?
8163000	8165000	No, but there's that too
8165000	8167000	So that wasn't Anonymous either
8167000	8169000	That wasn't Anonymous either. Somebody's out there
8169000	8171000	Hacking for personal information
8171000	8173000	Because maybe somebody in chat will, I'll ring a bell
8173000	8175000	Somebody hacked Gawker
8175000	8177000	Somebody hacked this email network to get
8177000	8179000	All the emails and so forth
8179000	8181000	I think it's them
8181000	8183000	That's getting Sony. I think somebody went after
8183000	8185000	That private information, it's Sony
8185000	8187000	So, yeah, and this is
8187000	8189000	What I have to say to you, is that
8189000	8191000	When
8191000	8193000	When you have a situation like this
8193000	8195000	Where, yeah, you may have an easy person
8195000	8197000	To place blame on
8197000	8199000	Keep in mind that
8199000	8201000	Wars have been started
8201000	8203000	Over people putting the blame where there was
8203000	8205000	On an innocent party, just because
8205000	8207000	Of quote, circumstantial evidence
8207000	8209000	Don't be one of those people
8209000	8211000	Don't be a dick like that
8211000	8213000	And also, with the DDS
8213000	8215000	DDoS attack
8215000	8217000	You know, you've got hundreds or thousands of computers
8217000	8219000	That have been compromised in some way
8219000	8221000	You're flooding the network with garbage
8221000	8223000	It's very hard, because you've got all of these compromised
8223000	8225000	Computers of just regular
8225000	8227000	PC owners
8227000	8229000	It's hard to
8229000	8231000	As obnoxious as it is
8231000	8233000	It's very difficult
8233000	8235000	It's not an actionable crime, is what I'm trying to say
8235000	8237000	Because the computers are compromised
8237000	8239000	If you're hacking into something
8239000	8241000	And you're getting customer information
8241000	8243000	Which hasn't been confirmed yet
8243000	8245000	That's like a federal, that's serious
8245000	8247000	And that's not their MO
8247000	8249000	That's totally not their MO
8249000	8251000	Keep in mind, all of the stuff that they've
8251000	8253000	Been doing is basically forms
8253000	8255000	Of vigilantism
8255000	8257000	They have gone after people who
8257000	8259000	They have perceived have committed
8259000	8261000	Some sort of crime that's
8261000	8263000	Not being punished in the proper way
8263000	8265000	And they are going after these people to make their lives
8265000	8267000	Miserable
8267000	8269000	Yeah, they'll waste some of your time and some of your money
8269000	8271000	And then that's it, they'll get their plan across
8271000	8273000	But when they've gone after people's information
8273000	8275000	It's been specific people
8275000	8277000	To have a specific thing happen
8277000	8279000	I've got to read some of these comments in chat, they're piling up here
8279000	8281000	In the true Easter spirit
8281000	8283000	Redertainment says, the Jews did it
8283000	8285000	Happy Easter
8285000	8287000	Fuck that
8287000	8289000	And fuck you
8289000	8291000	DefectiveCandy in our chatroom says
8291000	8293000	The Epsilon email hacking was supposedly
8293000	8295000	Accomplished by one rogue individual
8295000	8297000	Thank you, it's Epsilon
8297000	8299000	Could be a former employee
8299000	8301000	That's true
8301000	8303000	SSJ100Matt says
8303000	8305000	Blaming everything on 4chan
8305000	8307000	I thought that was anonymous
8307000	8309000	That's the home of anonymous
8309000	8311000	So there you go
8311000	8313000	I like what Cogito said
8313000	8315000	I don't think Sony was a hack at all
8315000	8317000	Someone lost the keys to the big Sony computer and they can't all get in
8317000	8319000	Check the crayon boxes
8319000	8321000	Get that leash out
8321000	8323000	There's like a cat that unplugged the thing
8323000	8325000	Meow
8325000	8327000	I'm in your Sony hack in your store
8327000	8329000	But seriously
8329000	8331000	Look at everything
8331000	8333000	Don't pick one convenient scapegoat
8333000	8335000	That's just
8335000	8337000	That's not very smart
8337000	8339000	Next email
8339000	8341000	Yay, happy sunshine
8341000	8343000	Unicorns that shit rainbows that kill people
8343000	8345000	Yay
8345000	8347000	Dear peoples
8347000	8349000	We're peoples
8349000	8351000	Oh, it's Redertainment
8351000	8353000	Like you, I've been following the recent PSN outages
8353000	8355000	Since I started popping up on Wednesday night
8355000	8357000	When I first discovered these outages
8357000	8359000	I was frustrated
8359000	8361000	Raged out and cursed to the love my neighbors thought I was killing someone
8361000	8363000	Not kidding
8363000	8365000	Anyway, in the process of following the story
8365000	8367000	I found the story that I'm sure you covered
8367000	8369000	Earlier on the show
8369000	8371000	Uh
8371000	8373000	Let me see what this is
8373000	8375000	I think that's just
8375000	8377000	Yeah, it's the same story we covered basically
8377000	8379000	From another source
8379000	8381000	Once I read the story, I became considerably less angry
8381000	8383000	As I can understand that Sony taking actions like this
8383000	8385000	In response to this threat to a point
8385000	8387000	However, there is one part of the story that really concerns me
8387000	8389000	This is
8389000	8391000	In order to
8391000	8393000	Verify the smooth and secure operation
8393000	8395000	Of the services Sony pulled the plug
8395000	8397000	On both services April 20th
8397000	8399000	This sentence gives me an impression that this isn't
8399000	8401000	A simple hacking job
8401000	8403000	Given Sony's recent movements in relation to piracy
8403000	8405000	I believe that this may be the nature of Sony
8405000	8407000	Taking down PSN
8407000	8409000	I believe someone figured out how to pirate games
8409000	8411000	Distributed digitally
8411000	8413000	Oh, this is a good idea
8413000	8415000	Distributed digitally via PSN
8415000	8417000	If any of these conclusions are wrong
8417000	8419000	Also, why do I have to go through PSN
8419000	8421000	Or live to access Hulu Plus or Netflix
8421000	8423000	I mean, when I want to watch Hulu
8423000	8425000	On my laptop, all I have to do is fire up my browser
8425000	8427000	Go through my ISP
8427000	8429000	To get to what I want to watch
8429000	8431000	I don't have to go through my laptop's manufacturer
8431000	8433000	Exclusive network to access things
8433000	8435000	So I don't have to do it on home consoles
8435000	8437000	Because they're evil
8437000	8439000	Stay black, redertainment
8439000	8441000	This message has been brought to you by the successor to Anonymous
8441000	8443000	Who was actually responsible for PSN
8443000	8445000	I wrote it down and it's totally unknown to the public
8445000	8447000	Nyanya
8447000	8449000	Sent from my iPad
8449000	8451000	Actually, we do have a theory in the chat room
8451000	8453000	On who might be to blame
8453000	8455000	For all of this that's going on on the PlayStation network
8455000	8457000	An interesting theory
8457000	8459000	We need to know
8459000	8461000	Play Canada
8461000	8463000	Play Canada
8463000	8465000	All their beady little eyes
8465000	8467000	Clap their heads and roll their lives
8467000	8469000	Play Canada
8469000	8471000	Play Canada
8471000	8473000	We need to form a full assault
8473000	8475000	Yep, it's all Canada's fault
8475000	8477000	Actually, we should blame SkyNet
8477000	8479000	We did survive Judgment Day
8479000	8481000	We did
8481000	8483000	In response to that email about why you have to authenticate
8483000	8485000	With the console before you can use Netflix and Hulu
8485000	8487000	For Netflix and Hulu
8487000	8489000	To allow a third party appliance
8489000	8491000	To run their service
8491000	8493000	There needs to be some sort of accountability
8493000	8495000	So that someone doesn't get an $8 Netflix account
8495000	8497000	Give their username and password to their 40 friends
8497000	8499000	That have a PlayStation 3
8499000	8501000	And have them all
8501000	8503000	Running Netflix off the one account
8503000	8505000	So I think
8505000	8507000	By authenticating into PSN
8507000	8509000	It's saying
8509000	8511000	This PSN account with this
8511000	8513000	PlayStation 3 ID is using this Netflix
8513000	8515000	And there's a sync there
8515000	8517000	And that's why they do it
8517000	8519000	However, it does not stop people from sharing Netflix accounts over the internet
8519000	8521000	Black Wolf says that Netflix will still work
8521000	8523000	You just gotta keep trying to log in
8523000	8525000	Three to five times, you can get in eventually
8525000	8527000	I haven't tried on PS3
8527000	8529000	I've just been
8529000	8531000	Playing Portal
8531000	8533000	Offline
8533000	8535000	Addict
8535000	8537000	Like it's a bad thing to be addicted to Portal
8537000	8539000	You can get down with that one
8539000	8541000	Totally
8541000	8543000	Okay
8543000	8545000	Hey OLR, I hope the move went well for you Rob
8545000	8547000	While you were busy with that, I was busy playing Portal 2
8547000	8551000	That game has some of the best writing in anything, period
8551000	8553000	Me too, Salacious Pop, unpack that box
8553000	8555000	I'm gonna play Portal
8555000	8557000	Let alone video games
8557000	8559000	It certainly puts out
8559000	8561000	What's out there to shame
8561000	8563000	For some reason I thought of you Rob when I saw this article
8563000	8565000	Okay, I have to look at this
8565000	8567000	Uh oh
8567000	8569000	It's still loading
8569000	8571000	There's gonna be huge spoilers
8571000	8573000	And you're gonna freak out
8573000	8575000	Kagura director thought of Nintendo 3DS
8575000	8577000	3D brushed 30 seconds later
8577000	8579000	Hey man
8579000	8581000	There's a guy who did
8581000	8583000	Half minute hero
8583000	8585000	I'm telling you
8585000	8587000	Didn't I talk about that on the show
8587000	8589000	In the 3DS we were talking about
8589000	8591000	They just need a game that's boobs, boobs and more boobs
8591000	8593000	Boobs in 3D, big boobs
8593000	8595000	Little boobs, black boobs, white boobs
8595000	8597000	All boobs, big
8597000	8599000	Boobs with big nips
8599000	8601000	Boobs with small nips, all types
8601000	8604000	United Nations of boobs
8604000	8606000	Coming soon on the 3DS
8606000	8608000	I don't know if you've ever heard of this before
8608000	8610000	But for the last few years there's been a convention
8610000	8612000	Dedicated to the world's favorite hedgehog
8612000	8614000	Held in London, Summer of Sonic
8614000	8616000	They usually have early previews
8616000	8618000	Of coming games and occasionally
8618000	8620000	Panels slash Q&As with developers
8620000	8622000	As well as writers for the old UK comic
8622000	8625000	And I hear this year for the US comics too
8625000	8627000	This year's is on July 25th if anyone's interested
8627000	8629000	I would love to go
8629000	8631000	Somebody get me to Europe
8631000	8633000	Hear you later, Catastrophic Moggy
8633000	8635000	P.S. I'm really excited
8635000	8637000	About the announcement of the Persona 4 anime
8637000	8639000	P.P.S. Hey Jamie, have you seen
8639000	8641000	The new episode of Doctor Who yet?
8641000	8643000	Every time someone does the colon P
8643000	8645000	I do, yes I saw it
8645000	8647000	And it was amazing
8647000	8649000	And then I was really pissed off at the end
8649000	8651000	And then I saw the preview for the next episode
8651000	8653000	So I wasn't just pissed off
8653000	8655000	I actually did pause it one time and go
8655000	8657000	That is bullshit!
8657000	8659000	And then kept watching
8659000	8661000	As I understand
8661000	8663000	I'm not the only person that did that
8663000	8665000	Do I do that when I watch TV?
8665000	8667000	Yell back at the TV?
8667000	8669000	I downloaded it
8669000	8671000	Sometimes when I watch Survivor
8671000	8673000	I go, oh no he didn't!
8673000	8675000	That's about as bad as I get
8675000	8677000	You talk during WoW when something bad happens
8677000	8679000	I do talk during WoW
8679000	8681000	Thank god Ventrilo
8681000	8683000	Isn't always on, let's just say that much
8683000	8685000	Why do you think I don't log into Ventrilo
8685000	8687000	That often?
8687000	8689000	Because Dan is usually sitting right where you're sitting Alan
8689000	8691000	Looking over at me like
8691000	8693000	You really, really get
8693000	8695000	Dirty mouth when you play this game
8695000	8697000	I was like, bitches
8697000	8699000	So yeah
8699000	8701000	And sometimes
8701000	8703000	Rob will sign into Vent and just be like
8703000	8705000	Oh, hey what's going on?
8705000	8707000	And I'll be sitting right next to him and I'm like, I'm fine
8707000	8709000	I'm reading, oh no they didn't
8709000	8711000	He's like, I'm on Vent, duh
8711000	8713000	I don't know your life
8713000	8715000	Yeah
8715000	8717000	Alright, is that it for emails?
8717000	8719000	That is it
8719000	8721000	We need more emails for next week
8721000	8723000	We need to beat the emails we had this week
8723000	8725000	I want Dark Soccer's email bag to take like an hour next week
8725000	8727000	Mailbag?
8727000	8729000	Hey, if this happens, okay if we get
8729000	8731000	If we break 10 emails
8731000	8733000	Next week, you have to get me tacos
8733000	8735000	I'm gonna get you tacos?
8735000	8737000	Fine
8737000	8739000	Fine
8739000	8741000	We get more than 10 emails next week
8741000	8743000	Not all from the same address
8743000	8745000	Not all from the same address
8745000	8747000	Unique, real emails
8747000	8749000	That are at least a paragraph in length
8749000	8751000	And with good grammar
8751000	8753000	3-4 sentences with proper grammar
8753000	8755000	Rob will buy me tacos
8755000	8757000	Or pink berry
8757000	8759000	Taco flavored pink berry
8759000	8761000	They're gonna be from emails
8761000	8763000	Like, you know, ShermyCat
8763000	8765000	Or this is totally not Dan
8765000	8767000	Hey mom, I pooped in the kitchen again
8767000	8769000	Love your cat
8769000	8771000	Number one Dan fan at Gmail
8771000	8773000	You should have Dan on more often
8773000	8775000	P.S. Bart
8775000	8777000	We should get like a taco tote board
8777000	8779000	And like show how many emails we've got during the week
8779000	8781000	And then be like, let's see if Jamie's gonna get tacos
8781000	8783000	Oh, we're at seven emails
8783000	8785000	So far this week
8785000	8787000	No taco for Jamie
8787000	8789000	Can we install that on the website?
8789000	8791000	The taco meter
8791000	8793000	The taco meter
8793000	8795000	Taco Tuesday is an official holiday
8795000	8797000	Every week
8797000	8799000	Black Wolf says, can I write a paragraph about how tasty the tacos would be?
8801000	8803000	Yes, you can
8803000	8805000	I will accept emails about tacos
8805000	8807000	Cause tacos are amazing
8807000	8809000	Or, you know, you can also do it about taco
8809000	8811000	Which is octopus
8811000	8813000	I love takoyaki
8813000	8815000	Or you could write a dissertation about the 80s song
8815000	8817000	Putting on the Ritz by Taco
8817000	8819000	No
8819000	8821000	It has to be video game related
8821000	8823000	Delicious, crispy taco related
8823000	8825000	Or tostadas I take those too
8825000	8827000	For fuck's sake, can we move on to another topic?
8827000	8829000	Taco
8829000	8831000	Okay
8831000	8833000	Alright, if you want to send us an email, of course, mailbag at orangelaundry.com
8833000	8835000	This is the part of the show where we get angsty
8835000	8855000	It's the FUs of the week segment
8855000	8857000	Dark Sakura
8857000	8859000	My FU goes to being really hungry right now
8859000	8861000	Because over the last whole week I've maybe had
8861000	8863000	At most
8863000	8865000	100 calories a day
8865000	8867000	Because I haven't really been able
8867000	8869000	To keep anything down
8869000	8871000	By the way, that candle came from the dollar store
8871000	8873000	Does it? That smells nice
8873000	8875000	I'm gonna have to raid the dollar tree
8875000	8877000	It's a pumpkin bread
8877000	8879000	Yeah, I love them, anyway
8879000	8881000	So, I haven't been able to eat anything
8881000	8883000	So now today is our annual Easter brunch
8883000	8885000	And my appetite came back with a vengeance
8885000	8887000	And now I'm super hungry
8887000	8889000	Like, I think that's why I'm thinking about tacos
8889000	8891000	Because I seriously haven't eaten
8891000	8893000	Since 10 this morning
8893000	8895000	No, about 10.30 this morning
8895000	8897000	And then I came home and took a nap
8897000	8899000	And I'm freaking hungry
8899000	8901000	I ate matzo when I woke up
8901000	8903000	And I normally do not like matzo by itself
8903000	8905000	I ate some
8905000	8907000	I want food
8907000	8909000	I want a salad
8909000	8911000	Actually, what I want is pinkberry, but it probably closed
8911000	8913000	Yeah, the whole Easter thing
8913000	8915000	Kind of makes places close
8915000	8917000	But I heart to you
8917000	8919000	From my wonderful coffee
8919000	8921000	Oh, you're welcome
8921000	8923000	Which is why I have someone from Lertness
8923000	8925000	Folks don't know, but a lot of times before the show
8925000	8927000	I do make a Starbucks rhyme
8927000	8929000	There's Starbucks everywhere
8929000	8931000	Like, saying there's one not far from Jamie's house
8931000	8933000	Is like, you know, gee, there's grass in the backyard
8933000	8935000	But yeah, there's a Starbucks nearby
8935000	8937000	I tend to get coffee a lot
8937000	8939000	I'm actually
8939000	8941000	I'm actually going to decaf
8941000	8943000	If I have it at night, it's gonna be decaf
8943000	8945000	Yeah, I did request a decaf
8945000	8947000	I'll remember that in the future
8947000	8949000	Do you have any FUs for this week?
8949000	8951000	Just, uh
8951000	8953000	Not being completely 100% done
8953000	8955000	With my old place
8955000	8957000	I'm happy for my former roommate
8957000	8959000	Because he found someone to move in with him
8959000	8961000	But just that
8961000	8963000	Having to go back to San Francisco one last time
8963000	8965000	And just unpacking in general
8965000	8967000	Is obnoxious
8967000	8969000	Otherwise, that's all
8969000	8971000	Pretty minor
8971000	8973000	Yeah, I don't have a lot to be angsty about
8973000	8975000	I mean, there's a lot of really good stuff going on for me right now
8975000	8977000	A lot of, like, happy news
8977000	8979000	I don't want to make you par for nothing
8979000	8981000	But it's good stuff
8981000	8983000	I will say FU to that freakin' headache I had earlier
8983000	8985000	That was almost migraine status
8985000	8987000	I would say, like, if headaches
8987000	8989000	Were on, like, the terrorism
8989000	8991000	Color chart
8991000	8993000	I would say the headache I had was code orange
8993000	8995000	It was pretty bad
8995000	8997000	But it wasn't, like, really bad
8997000	8999000	So, there you go
8999000	9001000	Alright, that does it for the FUs of the week
9001000	9003000	For now
9003000	9005000	I think Wolf is pointing out in our chatroom
9005000	9007000	That apparently Taco Bell has a lame Flash game
9007000	9009000	Called Taco Fu
9009000	9011000	At TacoBell.com slash TacoFu
9011000	9013000	That's okay
9013000	9015000	Way to merge the worlds of tacos and video games
9015000	9017000	Just want to give an A plus to Bobby
9017000	9019000	That's why he has his own show, folks
9019000	9021000	Burger King's, uh, Reigning
9021000	9023000	Dude, those, like, Sneak King and shit
9023000	9025000	Those games were awesome
9025000	9027000	Like, why? Like, for five bucks, they were great
9027000	9029000	Why? Why didn't they ever do that again?
9029000	9031000	They should do an update
9031000	9033000	They should do Burger Time and call it Taco Time
9033000	9035000	Weren't they supposed to do something with, uh, Kinect, I thought?
9035000	9037000	I think they are making a new
9037000	9039000	But they should do Taco Time
9039000	9041000	They are making a new Burger Time
9041000	9043000	It should be Taco Time
9043000	9045000	Okay, how about Choco Taco Time?
9045000	9047000	The villain that tries to, um, kill you
9047000	9049000	In Taco Time is the diarrhea monster
9049000	9051000	It's Montezuma
9051000	9053000	Wow, you guys are mature
9053000	9055000	Alright, two more stories
9055000	9057000	Then we're gonna get to the phones
9057000	9059000	Two more news stories
9059000	9061000	So, uh, Salacious Pop
9061000	9063000	Okay, so
9063000	9065000	Ubisoft is developing
9065000	9067000	A guitar game
9067000	9069000	It seems like maybe they'd be a little
9069000	9071000	That train has left the station
9071000	9073000	Perhaps, but, uh, they're working on a game
9073000	9075000	Called Rocksmith
9075000	9077000	Which sounds a lot like, uh, Pro Mode
9077000	9079000	In Rock Band
9079000	9081000	Except with a guitar
9081000	9083000	You can play this game with real guitars
9083000	9085000	And the
9085000	9087000	The UI and how the notes
9087000	9089000	Because you know how, um, DJ Hero
9089000	9091000	Guitar Hero Rock Band has the, uh,
9091000	9093000	The note highway that scrolls
9093000	9095000	Vertically
9095000	9097000	This one uses more of a
9097000	9099000	3D plane where you're in front
9099000	9101000	And you see the notes coming from the back of the screen
9101000	9103000	Moving towards you
9103000	9105000	Um, so it looks really complicated
9105000	9107000	I'm not sure how much of a market there might be for this
9107000	9109000	But anyway, they are demoing the game
9109000	9111000	At South by Southwest
9111000	9113000	In Texas
9113000	9115000	Which is a
9115000	9117000	It's a music and movies
9117000	9119000	It's kind of like a hipster-y
9119000	9121000	I know, I was like, if you want to find a place where all the hipsters are at
9121000	9123000	At one time, like, that's not
9123000	9125000	Tumblr
9125000	9127000	Yeah, but it's not like a Lollapalooza
9127000	9129000	There are a lot of great bands there, but it's also
9129000	9131000	Movies and art, and it's a whole pop culture thing
9131000	9133000	So yeah, Rocksmith is going to be
9133000	9135000	At South by Southwest, they're going to have musicians
9135000	9137000	Play it, and just show it off
9137000	9139000	I think they've got a whole Rocksmith tour bus
9139000	9141000	That sets up
9141000	9143000	Bass, and it's going to be at
9143000	9145000	South by Southwest
9145000	9147000	Yeah, I like the way they've done that
9147000	9149000	Where they have the guitar silhouette in front
9149000	9151000	Of the falling stream of notes
9151000	9153000	It's kind of a neat little way to do it
9153000	9155000	Alright, we'll see if this game can actually
9155000	9157000	Be successful, kind of break the recent curse
9157000	9159000	Of music games
9159000	9161000	We'll see
9161000	9163000	One more story for you guys
9163000	9165000	Everybody get out your 40s and get ready to pour it
9165000	9167000	The PSP Go
9167000	9169000	Is officially dead
9169000	9171000	That's right folks, pour out the 40s
9171000	9173000	Devastated
9173000	9175000	How did this happen?
9175000	9177000	This is, I don't understand
9177000	9179000	Apparently the whole thing
9179000	9181000	Is started by a Sony shop employee
9181000	9183000	Saying that the store was not going to get
9183000	9185000	Any more shipments, and then the PSP
9185000	9187000	Go disappeared from the Sony store
9187000	9189000	Page, Sony is not confirming
9189000	9191000	The news, but in their
9191000	9193000	Statement, they're kind of trying to say, well why
9193000	9195000	Are you asking about the Go? Shouldn't we be talking
9195000	9197000	About the NGP? The awesome
9197000	9199000	News system coming out from Sony?
9199000	9201000	Yeah, so
9201000	9203000	Although Sony hasn't confirmed it
9203000	9205000	They haven't really denied it either
9205000	9207000	In the UK as well, the PSP
9207000	9209000	Go production has ceased, that has been proven
9209000	9211000	So the PSP Go
9211000	9213000	It's dead
9213000	9215000	So it's basically become the sort of
9215000	9217000	The
9217000	9219000	The cousin that is
9219000	9221000	Touched in the head that now lives in the attic
9221000	9223000	That the family doesn't talk about
9223000	9225000	Those thuds that you hear, we don't know
9225000	9227000	No, he died when he was
9227000	9229000	Born, we don't know who that is
9229000	9231000	Some of the comments from our chatroom, of course the
9231000	9233000	Raging comedy club that is the Orange Lounge Radio
9233000	9235000	Chatroom, Frisbee calls it the
9235000	9237000	PSP Go away
9237000	9239000	Let's see, Redertainment says, wait, the PSP
9239000	9241000	Go wasn't already dead?
9241000	9243000	AlphaCanandagram says, wait, wasn't this debunked
9243000	9245000	Saying only Europe isn't going to carry it and
9245000	9247000	US is still going to have them?
9247000	9249000	Dude
9249000	9251000	It's going to go
9251000	9253000	Sorry
9253000	9255000	There you go, BlackWolf would like you to know that
9255000	9257000	South by Southwest was actually last month
9257000	9259000	So we're a little behind on the news apparently
9259000	9261000	But that's where all the video was from
9261000	9263000	I believe, I think it's just being compiled
9263000	9265000	And put on the internet now
9265000	9267000	So there you go
9267000	9269000	Alright
9269000	9271000	Shall we open up the Skype line?
9271000	9273000	Yeah, let's do it
9273000	9275000	1877 GameOLR
9275000	9277000	Our username in Skype is Orange Lounge Radio
9277000	9279000	Now earlier in the evening
9279000	9281000	Bobby had a problem seeing us
9281000	9283000	On Skype, but we assure you we're on
9283000	9285000	And I see plenty of our regular callers
9285000	9287000	Signing into Skype right now, so I'm assuming
9287000	9289000	It's fine, but I assure you we
9289000	9291000	Are on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio
9291000	9293000	If you aren't down with that though, you can always call
9293000	9295000	Our toll-free number, 1877
9295000	9297000	GameOLR
9297000	9299000	Of course, this is usually the part of the show where
9299000	9301000	I'd ask Loki if he has any last minute stories
9301000	9303000	He's not here
9303000	9305000	And I didn't tell anyone else to prep for that
9305000	9306000	Way to plan
9306000	9307000	I have a story
9307000	9308000	What's that?
9308000	9310000	Taco
9310000	9312000	Give me
9312000	9314000	Alright, let's just go to the phones
9314000	9316000	They're already ringing, thank god
9316000	9318000	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
9318000	9320000	It's Legend of Zaku
9320000	9322000	Hey, Legend of Zaku, what's on your mind buddy?
9322000	9324000	Nothing much, just like chilling in my room
9324000	9326000	Fixing other people's PCs
9326000	9328000	Resting up for tomorrow's work day
9328000	9330000	What's tomorrow? Oh, work? Back to the grind?
9330000	9332000	Yeah, back to the grind
9332000	9334000	The evil grind
9334000	9336000	Evil post-Easter grind
9336000	9338000	You want to talk about something from our show?
9338000	9340000	Or some other stories that didn't come?
9340000	9342000	Folks at Gearbox have been really good sports recently
9342000	9344000	With that proposal that they did
9344000	9346000	You know, that Borderlands proposal
9346000	9348000	That they did for this fan
9348000	9350000	Out in Texas
9350000	9352000	I have the video where
9352000	9354000	I think Claptrap, actually
9354000	9356000	The voice of Claptrap
9356000	9358000	They put up a video using that
9358000	9360000	As a way to propose to a girl
9360000	9362000	Just pull it up right now
9362000	9364000	Yeah, we did cover it at the top of the
9364000	9366000	Show, or at the top of the segment
9366000	9368000	Just so you know, you missed it
9368000	9370000	We did talk about it
9370000	9372000	What did you think about it?
9372000	9374000	It's pretty good that Gearbox of all companies
9374000	9376000	Is pretty much playing the Valve card
9376000	9378000	And giving their fans
9378000	9380000	Pulling all those stops for their fans
9380000	9382000	Why do you say Gearbox of all companies?
9382000	9384000	The way you phrase that is very interesting
9384000	9386000	Do you think Gearbox is trying to be Valve?
9386000	9388000	Gearbox, you know
9388000	9390000	One of many
9390000	9392000	Of all the other companies out there
9392000	9394000	Gearbox is also
9394000	9396000	Using that same
9396000	9398000	Basically playing that same Valve card
9398000	9400000	You wouldn't see Sony
9400000	9402000	Or Activision pull that
9402000	9404000	Pull those stunts
9404000	9406000	You wouldn't even flip over
9406000	9408000	For any fans that still want
9408000	9410000	DJ Hero
9410000	9412000	I would say Gearbox's shining achievement
9412000	9414000	Is that they are actually going to fucking put out
9414000	9416000	Duke Nukem forever
9416000	9418000	That is how history will smile
9418000	9420000	Upon them fondly
9420000	9422000	Unless the game is the most atrocious piece of shit
9422000	9424000	We've ever played
9424000	9426000	It's not that bad
9426000	9428000	Even though you do mention
9428000	9430000	Shit in that sentence
9430000	9432000	You do know you could actually use
9432000	9434000	Excrement as a weapon in that game
9434000	9436000	Hooray, I'm so excited
9436000	9438000	Yes, you could actually
9438000	9440000	Shit bomb people in that game
9440000	9442000	I've always wanted to fling my poo in a video game
9442000	9444000	Where I wasn't playing as a monkey
9444000	9446000	I'm
9446000	9448000	I'm touched
9448000	9450000	Just a while ago I actually seen the video
9450000	9452000	And yeah
9452000	9454000	I know it's shocking
9454000	9456000	Right now I'm just trying to gather up
9456000	9458000	Just trying to see what I can
9458000	9460000	What I can get right now
9460000	9462000	In terms of games
9462000	9464000	I know Mortal Kombat is on my list right now
9464000	9466000	Since it was either that or
9466000	9468000	Marvel vs. Capcom 3
9468000	9470000	But after seeing the fatalities
9470000	9472000	A week before they got
9472000	9474000	Before it launched
9474000	9476000	That pretty much convinced me at that point
9476000	9478000	It's either that
9478000	9480000	I mean, it's that and L.A. Noire
9480000	9482000	Spring
9482000	9484000	We're approaching some busy times
9484000	9486000	I think the busy time
9486000	9488000	Was this past week
9488000	9490000	Something that didn't even freaking occur to me
9490000	9492000	Is that this week
9492000	9494000	And the next week depending on where you live
9494000	9496000	Is Spring Break
9496000	9498000	Usually it's either the week before or the week after Easter
9498000	9500000	Is Spring Break
9500000	9502000	So these games coming out
9502000	9504000	Like so many all at once
9504000	9506000	Is not a surprise
9506000	9508000	PlayStation 3 Network going down for 5 days
9508000	9510000	That is a little bit more of a surprise
9510000	9512000	Hence why I think what's happening over there
9512000	9514000	Is really bad
9514000	9516000	What in Japan or getting hammered
9516000	9518000	By Anonymous?
9518000	9520000	I don't think this is a simple
9520000	9522000	DDOS from Anonymous
9522000	9524000	Again earlier in the show
9524000	9526000	I'm pretty sure they cracked open
9526000	9528000	One of their holes
9528000	9530000	I don't think this is
9530000	9532000	I think this is somebody who's done something
9532000	9534000	A lot more serious than DDOS
9534000	9536000	I think personal information has been compromised
9536000	9538000	I think there's going to be more to develop on this
9538000	9540000	Again I could be talking out my butt
9540000	9542000	That's fine I'm some schmo with a podcast on the internet
9542000	9544000	But when Sony isn't being up front
9544000	9546000	I'm left to speculate
9546000	9548000	Sony is basically acting like any other
9548000	9550000	Japanese person would
9550000	9552000	By not revealing any damning information
9552000	9554000	You know at the moment
9554000	9556000	They're trying to make it seem
9556000	9558000	I don't know if I'd say that but okay
9558000	9560000	I mean as I said
9560000	9562000	You could draw parallels to the way
9562000	9564000	Japan handled the whole
9564000	9566000	Nuclear reactor crisis
9566000	9568000	The way they were with that power company
9568000	9570000	Aren't we getting a little
9570000	9572000	Okay isn't this a little
9572000	9574000	Tinfoil hat
9574000	9576000	No it's like any government
9576000	9578000	The Japanese are very
9578000	9580000	They're open about it
9580000	9582000	They're basically
9582000	9584000	They openly lie to people
9584000	9586000	So that way they can look good
9586000	9588000	Not necessarily panic
9588000	9590000	Because would you rather
9590000	9592000	Hear from Sony that personal information
9592000	9594000	Has been compromised now
9594000	9596000	And then you're going to have people bitching in the forums
9596000	9598000	And everywhere else and congress getting involved
9598000	9600000	Or would you rather have that later on
9600000	9602000	When it's less of a problem
9602000	9604000	And they're actually back online
9604000	9606000	I would rather have it now
9606000	9608000	Because it's my fucking information
9608000	9610000	Well that's up to Sony to decide
9610000	9612000	They personally have it in their possession
9612000	9614000	You gave it to them as a contract
9614000	9616000	Of which you know to join PSN
9616000	9618000	So it's not like you can get it
9618000	9622000	Back somehow
9622000	9624000	But you have to realize that
9624000	9626000	I'm pretty certain it's a lot worse than
9626000	9628000	What they're actually going to say
9628000	9630000	They don't want to create panic
9630000	9632000	Or else that's going to hurt their stock
9632000	9634000	That's going to hurt their reputation
9634000	9636000	What about their legal obligation
9636000	9638000	From doing business in the state of California
9638000	9640000	And the United States
9640000	9642000	Where they are an entity
9642000	9644000	We've already had the whole
9644000	9646000	They are a California company
9646000	9648000	Has been established before
9648000	9650000	And they are going to have to disclose
9650000	9652000	If personal information has been compromised
9652000	9654000	They have to
9654000	9656000	And that's all part of the panic
9656000	9658000	If they say that
9658000	9660000	If they say that now
9660000	9662000	Unless they find a way to do damage control
9662000	9664000	Then it's going to sink
9664000	9666000	Their stock pretty fast
9666000	9668000	Unless they find a way to
9668000	9670000	To say it in a way
9670000	9672000	Where it's not that big of a threat
9672000	9674000	Even though it actually is
9674000	9676000	But that's the whole point
9676000	9678000	They have to, from a PR perspective
9678000	9680000	They have to release it
9680000	9682000	In a way that it doesn't impact
9682000	9684000	Their reputation
9684000	9686000	And whatever else they have on the line
9686000	9688000	Next week
9688000	9690000	I think we can both agree that next week
9690000	9692000	Is going to be a very interesting week
9692000	9694000	And hopefully we're not sitting here a week from now
9694000	9696000	Saying no, we're on day 12 of the PSN outage
9696000	9698000	Alright, Zacho, I gotta let you go to get more calls
9698000	9700000	I can't wait to see what emails we get in response
9700000	9702000	To your call tonight, but have a good one, buddy
9702000	9704000	So I have a good one
9704000	9706000	Alright, the views and opinions expressed
9706000	9708000	By the callers, not necessarily like those
9708000	9710000	Alright, 1877 Game OLR
9710000	9712000	Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio
9712000	9714000	SalaciousPop doing his due diligence
9714000	9716000	During that call finding some last minute stories
9716000	9718000	Gold star for you
9718000	9722000	South Korea yesterday voted on a curfew
9722000	9724000	That would prevent
9724000	9726000	Children under the age of 15
9726000	9728000	To play online games
9728000	9730000	From midnight until 6 AM
9730000	9732000	No more all nighters for the Starcraft 2
9732000	9734000	It's all PC gaming it sounds like
9734000	9736000	Instead you need to be studying
9736000	9738000	And I guess it's being blocked
9738000	9740000	On the ISP level
9740000	9742000	The DNS to the gaming servers
9742000	9744000	If the parents register that they have a kid
9744000	9746000	They get cut off
9746000	9748000	Kinda scary what the government can do at that level
9748000	9750000	It's very interesting
9750000	9752000	Alright, we got a phone call, hold on
9752000	9754000	We'll revisit this thought in a minute
9754000	9756000	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?
9756000	9758000	Hey guys, this is Blue Swim
9758000	9760000	I'm doing just fine, how about you guys?
9760000	9762000	Good, I wish we had more callers calling
9762000	9764000	Hey guys!
9764000	9766000	Hey, first time caller as well
9766000	9768000	Yes, that's true
9768000	9770000	What's on your mind, Blue Swim?
9770000	9772000	I was wondering what you guys thought of
9772000	9774000	Blaze Blue Continuum Shift 2
9774000	9776000	And Dead or Alive Dimensions
9776000	9778000	Going practically head to head
9778000	9780000	At the end of May
9780000	9782000	Well, you know
9782000	9784000	It's not the first time that fighters
9784000	9786000	Have really gone against each other, I don't think
9786000	9788000	Didn't Street Fighter 4 come out
9788000	9790000	At the same time as
9790000	9792000	Oh god, there was something else
9792000	9794000	That came out, I thought right around the same time
9794000	9796000	Maybe somebody in chat will get me
9796000	9798000	Yeah, but we ignored it because it was Street Fighter 4 coming out
9798000	9800000	For real
9800000	9802000	I think these two series
9802000	9804000	Are kind of separate enough
9804000	9806000	Where they can coexist peacefully
9806000	9808000	Because let's face it, Blaze Blue, Blazblue
9808000	9810000	Whatever you want to call it
9810000	9812000	Very heavily Japanese influenced
9812000	9814000	Very anime, very, you know
9814000	9816000	Dead or Alive
9816000	9818000	As much as it's very Japanese
9818000	9820000	As well, don't get me wrong
9820000	9822000	It's very much more for the T&A audience
9822000	9824000	And it kind of
9824000	9826000	There you go, it's more of the Texas game
9826000	9828000	Because everything's bigger in Texas
9828000	9830000	And
9830000	9832000	So that's kind of why I'm like
9832000	9834000	I think these two games can coexist
9834000	9836000	They have very different audiences
9836000	9838000	Do you think that
9838000	9840000	You know, with the 3DS
9840000	9842000	Having three major
9842000	9844000	Fighters in the first two months
9844000	9846000	Of its life, it's going to turn it into a
9846000	9848000	Portable fighting game
9848000	9850000	Like the portable gaming
9850000	9852000	Fighting game platform
9852000	9854000	Yes and no, I mean when those three games
9854000	9856000	Are probably the only three games worth owning
9856000	9858000	On the 3DS right now
9858000	9860000	No, I shouldn't say that
9860000	9862000	I also bought Pilotwings, I haven't played it yet
9862000	9864000	It's just, it's a little frustrating
9864000	9866000	There wasn't a bigger title
9866000	9868000	But you know, looking at what Street Fighter 4
9868000	9870000	Does, I mean it really brings
9870000	9872000	Pretty much the whole experience
9872000	9874000	Of the Xbox version
9874000	9876000	To the portable console
9876000	9878000	And what's interesting about that is that a lot of times
9878000	9880000	You used to hear this shit, right
9880000	9882000	Like when Mortal Kombat came out on the Game Boy
9882000	9884000	It was like
9884000	9886000	Experience, the arcade experience
9886000	9888000	On the go, and it's like
9888000	9890000	Dude, this game fucking blows
9890000	9892000	Like I've got two buttons
9892000	9894000	And it's all like
9894000	9896000	Like you know, it's got like three frames
9896000	9898000	A second, this game sucks
9898000	9900000	But Street Fighter 4
9900000	9902000	It pretty much
9902000	9904000	Plays really like the Xbox
9904000	9906000	Versions, I'll tell you my biggest bitch
9906000	9908000	About the game is the controls
9908000	9910000	Like I think it's because I'm not a kid
9910000	9912000	And I have fat hands
9912000	9914000	But the 3DS thing does not feel
9914000	9916000	Very good in my fat hands for trying to play
9916000	9918000	A fighter with the L and R buttons and everything
9918000	9920000	The analog thumb thing
9920000	9922000	In my opinion is too slippery
9922000	9924000	And the D-pad is too small
9924000	9926000	For my giant spindly man hands
9926000	9928000	And I don't like where the D-pad is positioned
9928000	9930000	As far as like a fighting game goes
9930000	9932000	It's a little weird
9932000	9934000	Yeah it cramps the crap out of my hands
9934000	9936000	When I'm like playing Bison trying to
9936000	9938000	Do like a knee press nightmare or something like that
9938000	9940000	It kills my fingers
9940000	9942000	Yet I decided to go online and do the whole internet match
9942000	9944000	Earlier and I got my ass handed
9944000	9946000	To me by some asshole playing as Cody
9946000	9948000	Seems like every asshole
9948000	9950000	On Street Fighter 4 plays Cody
9950000	9952000	And I call them assholes because they're better than me
9952000	9954000	What are you
9954000	9956000	What fighting game are you looking forward to
9956000	9958000	Out of those two?
9958000	9960000	I pretty much bought the 3DS at launch
9960000	9962000	Expecting the Dead or Alive
9962000	9964000	To be there
9964000	9966000	I've been a hardcore Dead or Alive fan
9966000	9968000	Since 2002
9968000	9970000	I want to say
9970000	9972000	It prevented me from trading in my original
9972000	9974000	Xbox when I discovered
9974000	9976000	The Dead or Alive 3 demo
9976000	9978000	On demo disc
9978000	9980000	And ever since then
9980000	9982000	I've been absolutely
9982000	9984000	Hooked on the franchise
9984000	9986000	I've put maybe 300 hours into
9986000	9988000	Dead or Alive Ultimate
9988000	9990000	And another 100 and
9990000	9992000	100 plus in Dead or Alive 4
9992000	9994000	I find it very interesting how they've
9994000	9996000	Talked about this whole it's gonna run 30 frames a second
9996000	9998000	In 3D but it will run 60 frames
9998000	10000000	A second in 2D
10000000	10002000	That's a distinction I don't notice as much
10002000	10004000	In like Super Street Fighter 4
10004000	10006000	It kind of looks the same no matter what mode you're in
10006000	10008000	Did you turn the 3D off in the options
10008000	10010000	Menu because if you turn the slider
10010000	10012000	Off it will still render the game
10012000	10014000	In 30 frames per second
10014000	10016000	But when you turn the 3D option
10016000	10018000	Off in the options menu
10018000	10020000	And you're playing like offline
10020000	10022000	It is absolutely gorgeous
10022000	10024000	I haven't
10024000	10026000	I need to try that what a good tip
10026000	10028000	I'm glad we do this show see even I learn shit on this show
10028000	10030000	No I haven't I'm gonna try that
10030000	10032000	Nice maybe that's what I'm missing
10032000	10034000	That's gonna run very fluid
10034000	10036000	When I try that that's cool
10036000	10038000	The 60 frames doesn't carry over to the online
10038000	10040000	Portion unfortunately
10040000	10042000	But I mean if you're playing you know the arcade
10042000	10044000	Mode or versus mode or whatever I mean
10044000	10046000	It's just yeah it's gorgeous
10046000	10048000	Have you had any real quick before we let you
10048000	10050000	Go cause we gotta fit in at least one more call tonight
10050000	10052000	Have you had any luck with the street pass in Super Street Fighter 4?
10052000	10054000	Not a bit and I've been carrying
10054000	10056000	That thing with me almost constantly
10056000	10058000	You know I live near Nashville
10058000	10060000	And there's a ton of
10060000	10062000	You know ton of stores around here you know
10062000	10064000	Best Buy and GameStop and stuff like that
10064000	10066000	I have not had one street pass fight with them
10066000	10068000	Interesting I mean I'm hearing
10068000	10070000	Those things aren't activating very much and it could be a variety
10070000	10072000	Of things it could be that the battery life is so
10072000	10074000	Eh on those things that it's not pulsing
10074000	10076000	The street pass very often
10076000	10078000	That's kinda one thing I'm hearing and then the other is just
10078000	10080000	You know how many people carry their DS in sleep mode
10080000	10082000	With them everywhere they go very few
10082000	10084000	So I don't know I'm gonna try
10084000	10086000	This week I'm gonna try going to the mall this week
10086000	10088000	And see if I get anybody on street pass
10088000	10090000	At least walk into GameStop you know some of those employees
10090000	10092000	Have gotta have it going we'll see
10092000	10094000	I think that's where I got
10094000	10096000	Where I got one of my
10096000	10098000	Street pass me's was
10098000	10100000	GameStop and the other was like a demo unit at Best Buy
10100000	10102000	Other than that I haven't had any action
10102000	10104000	On it I never thought of trying a demo unit
10104000	10106000	At Best Buy that's a great idea
10106000	10108000	We'll see alright BlueSwip I've gotta let you
10108000	10110000	Go so we can get more calls but thanks for the call

10112000	10114000	You too happy birthday Jamie
10114000	10116000	Thank you
10116000	10118000	See I like enthusiastic
10118000	10120000	Callers people that just I'm just really happy to be
10120000	10122000	Here
10122000	10124000	Exciting alright sorry
10124000	10126000	I want more happy people
10126000	10128000	Everyone
10128000	10130000	BlueSwip should be your role model
10130000	10132000	Alright other
10132000	10134000	Stories that you've got Salacious Popper I don't know
10134000	10136000	If you want to finish your thoughts on that last one
10136000	10138000	Well I was just saying that for the
10138000	10140000	South Korea gaming curfew that's a
10140000	10142000	Part of the world not necessarily
10142000	10144000	Just South Korea where people will just
10144000	10146000	Stop peeing when they play
10146000	10148000	Starcraft 2 and then they die
10148000	10150000	Bladder explodes and they die so obviously
10150000	10152000	I think there's a demand for that kind of regulation
10152000	10154000	I forgot to mention I played some more Starcraft 2
10154000	10156000	This week Starjeweled is my new
10156000	10158000	Favorite add-on ever for Starcraft
10158000	10160000	It's great you play Bejeweled
10160000	10162000	And then you use the points you get in Bejeweled
10162000	10164000	To like buy units and it's like a tug
10164000	10166000	Of war match it's awesome
10166000	10168000	Like Jamie you might
10168000	10170000	Actually like Starcraft 2 if I were to buy
10170000	10172000	That I don't know we'll see
10172000	10174000	Hi I'm here
10174000	10176000	I'm here
10176000	10178000	Echoing you got to fix that
10178000	10180000	I don't know why but I'm hearing myself come through
10180000	10182000	You got to fix your settings
10182000	10184000	But thank you for the bags
10186000	10188000	Alright we'll see maybe he'll fix that
10188000	10190000	And try calling back
10190000	10192000	Which nobody else but the people in this room and he will get
10192000	10194000	1877 game
10194000	10196000	OLR username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio
10196000	10198000	Echo123 is always a good way
10198000	10200000	To test this that's somebody who calls us pretty regularly
10200000	10202000	Though so I don't know what's going on
10202000	10204000	Quick last minute story Minecraft
10204000	10206000	2 million paid
10206000	10208000	Fuck that's a game I still haven't played
10208000	10210000	2 million people have paid for the
10210000	10212000	Beta access which is roughly
10212000	10214000	28-29% of its
10214000	10216000	Entire user base
10216000	10218000	So a third so a little under
10218000	10220000	A third of their player base is paid for the game
10220000	10222000	For a little indie sandbox kind of
10222000	10224000	Aspie
10224000	10226000	Thing that's pretty impressive
10226000	10228000	You know some are saying it's too early to call Portal 2
10228000	10230000	The game of the year when you have something like Minecraft
10230000	10232000	Out there
10232000	10234000	It has that same 3D
10234000	10236000	With the weird spritey problem
10236000	10238000	I can't play it for very long
10238000	10240000	I need to check it out
10240000	10242000	We need to play Minecraft
10242000	10244000	We need to have Minecraft night
10244000	10246000	Try to figure out why people lose their shit over this game
10246000	10248000	I think it's 15 euros
10248000	10250000	Which translates to like 20 bucks
10250000	10252000	Or 22 bucks US because the euros are worth more than the dollar
10252000	10254000	Yeah
10254000	10256000	I remember it being like $19.99
10256000	10258000	They have a demo though right?
10258000	10260000	Isn't there like demo levels?
10260000	10262000	Do you?
10262000	10264000	Yeah hold on I want it
10264000	10266000	1877 game OLR username on skype is orange
10266000	10268000	I'm going to try keeping it open one more second
10268000	10270000	Especially if that last guy can get there
10270000	10272000	Oh maybe I deleted it
10272000	10274000	I'm so bad I always forget
10274000	10276000	I still have Ragnarok online
10276000	10278000	Let's see
10278000	10280000	An obvious spam person out of Bulgaria wants to be our friend
10280000	10282000	Block
10282000	10284000	That's no fun
10284000	10286000	Alright we're going to try this one more time
10286000	10288000	Give this guy one more chance here
10288000	10290000	Let's go back to the phones
10290000	10292000	No it's still echoing
10292000	10294000	Hello?
10294000	10296000	Now I'm not hearing it
10296000	10298000	Yeah I wasn't doing it before
10298000	10300000	You hung up and I was like okay that's kind of weird
10300000	10302000	And I tried to echo and the echo came out fine
10302000	10304000	That's weird alright well it works now what's on your mind buddy?
10304000	10306000	By the way this is xlink
10306000	10308000	Hi xlink sorry
10308000	10310000	I recognize your voice at this point
10310000	10312000	What's on your mind buddy?
10312000	10314000	You know actually it was kind of funny
10314000	10316000	Another caller kind of talked about this earlier
10316000	10318000	The whole Valve thing in Portal 2
10318000	10324000	I was watching the whole thing as it unfolded right before Portal 2 came out
10324000	10326000	The ARG
10326000	10334000	And it's kind of cool reading the stories of how Valve gave pretty much open access to these indie companies
10334000	10338000	You know basically telling hey you want to be part of this come on in we'll give you full access
10338000	10340000	We'll help you any way possible
10340000	10342000	We'll give you all these materials
10342000	10345000	We'll do anything we can to make this work
10345000	10356000	And it was really cool reading some of the company stories of like how everything progressed from day one to the night of the release
10356000	10358000	When everything got completed
10358000	10365000	Is that the whole thing I heard at the tail end of Bobby's show where there's like an iPad app that Jeff Keighley was involved with
10365000	10371000	Where they've like chronicled the entire last development cycle of Portal is that what you're talking about?
10371000	10377000	Likely yes and I don't know exactly what the app has in it because I don't have it right now
10377000	10381000	And I don't have the money for it so I can't really tell
10381000	10386000	But the impression that I'm getting from our pal Bobby who talked about it a little bit more on his show tonight
10386000	10390000	Is that it's basically like imagine like an interactive news article
10390000	10393000	And when I say or I should say magazine feature
10393000	10401000	Because it's more like what 10,000 word article or something like that that has videos, pictures, behind the scenes stuff
10401000	10402000	Probably
10402000	10407000	Yeah it kind of sounds like honestly what more magazines ought to be doing on the iPad
10407000	10408000	Yeah
10408000	10412000	The people and how all these people, these groups of people don't know each other
10412000	10417000	And they're willing going hey I have a free copy of like audio surf I'm willing to give to you
10417000	10421000	So that way you get your potatoes so that way we can make the multiplier faster
10421000	10426000	So we can get you know it was very cool seeing everybody come together the squad going
10426000	10431000	Okay which game should we play we should play this one so this way the timer can go down more and more and more
10431000	10437000	And it was just very neat watching the whole thing as it unfolded it was very cool
10437000	10445000	That is yeah I did play I did my part I played audio surf it was fun even though I had no intention of buying it on PC
10445000	10449000	Because I knew I'd already had the PS3 one ordered but it was still it was you know it was fun
10449000	10454000	I like those things kind of get the community riled up like that and Valve is a heck of a company
10454000	10459000	That's really what it boils down to I mean they just has Valve ever put out a bad game
10459000	10461000	No not that I know
10461000	10466000	Yeah Valve is in a very elite group of developers that just does not put out bad games
10466000	10469000	And I would say Blizzard's probably in there too
10469000	10473000	Blizzard I don't think has ever put out a bad game until Cataclysm no I'm kidding I'm kidding
10473000	10480000	And then let's see what else there's got to be at least one other I'm sure there's many folks
10480000	10486000	Bioware has a pedigree but that's then you're getting to the more you know
10486000	10490000	See part of me would say well Bethesda because they put out such awesome stuff
10490000	10493000	And then I'm like oh but they did that Star Trek game that was really not good
10493000	10497000	So you know a lot of developers do have a little blemishes on their record
10497000	10504000	Or bizarre creations before they close but they made that Bond game that wasn't so hot so unfortunately they had a blemish too
10504000	10506000	You know so but there's very rare companies
10506000	10510000	It's in a myth market depending on what the people want at the time so I mean you know
10510000	10515000	And it depends on who does it to a lot of it depends on how much work they put into it you know
10515000	10518000	If they're gonna put it in work for six months they throw it out there in the market inspect it to sell
10518000	10523000	And it turns out to be a complete piece of shit I mean you know you can't really get too much from it
10523000	10530000	But it's obvious they took a lot of time and effort behind what they want and it really paid off
10530000	10535000	It paid off in big time so like I said before people were very happy with this whole thing
10535000	10540000	And the way it unfolded at the end so and then of course with Portal 2 being the way it is so
10540000	10546000	Kaiju in our chat room says Valve put out that shitty poker game I believe that was Telltale wasn't it
10546000	10549000	That was Telltale and it's not really that bad unless you really find it
10549000	10551000	It's a budget title
10551000	10557000	It's a budget title and it's really short and I wish they would I kind of wish they would add
10557000	10563000	Maybe a few extra people or extra things to it but for a budget title being ten bucks for poker
10563000	10565000	It's not really all that bad
10565000	10573000	And Telltale's about in that pedigree too I mean it kind of depends how into the games they're putting out you are
10573000	10576000	But they put out a lot of quality stuff too
10576000	10577000	Yeah
10577000	10582000	So anyway sorry I don't want to turn this into a developer penis size contest but you know I thought it would be fun
10582000	10587000	And the gearbox was very interesting too that whole story about the proposal too
10587000	10592000	You should watch both the videos first the video of the proposal and then how it all came about
10592000	10597000	Because he checked a bunch of his friends saying that he got the exclusive for the
10597000	10601000	Because being a big fan they gave him an exclusive for Borderlands 2
10601000	10606000	And it turned out to be the proposal video so it's very cute how the whole thing came around
10606000	10607000	Wow
10607000	10614000	Gearbox got off the ground thanks to Valve because Gearbox got the Half-Life 1 expansion license
10614000	10616000	They did Blue Shift and
10616000	10618000	Oh wow I didn't even know that
10618000	10625000	Something Force with the Marine Adrian Shepard but the Half-Life expansions that came out in 98-99 that was Gearbox
10625000	10626000	Well there you go
10626000	10630000	Alright well X-Link I got to let you go so we can wrap up the show but any other quick final thoughts
10630000	10637000	Nope that's about it sorry about the call earlier sorry about all that usually I don't have any of those problems I usually call Echo 1, 2, 3 beforehand so
10637000	10639000	Minus 50 DKP
10639000	10640000	Yeah no joke
10640000	10641000	Later

10659000	10666000	I know alright well that's a sign that we need to wrap up the show and get on out of here so we can't wrap up the show though until we go around and get some final thoughts
10666000	10670000	Oh actually I should ask if you have any other quick last minute stories you want to get out
