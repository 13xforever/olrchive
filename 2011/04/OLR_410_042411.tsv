10510	11291	I am Loki!
31638	36702	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36802	39203	It's the show where every gamer has a voice.
39624	48530	We tape live at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf Show.
48991	49791	My name is Rob Roberts.
49831	52233	I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-hosts.
52313	55095	First up, the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
55255	55555	Hi.
55795	56276	How are you?
56296	56376	Good.
56696	58477	Feeling far better than I did previously.
58657	58857	Yes.
59918	60618	I can eat now.
61058	62899	Oh, I'm sorry to hear you were sick and all.
63239	63620	What happened?
63640	64740	You just had a... No idea.
64780	65621	I think it was just a bug.
65641	66721	Oh, that's too bad.
66981	71223	It had to have been a virus because nobody else got sick, so... Do you feel refreshed after a week off?
71243	72144	We weren't here last week.
72904	81949	Um... And you were really the only one that didn't, like, have anything going... Well, I mean, I don't know if you ended up doing something else, but... I got to spend... It was Loki's and my fault, so... I got to spend a good night with my boy.
82149	82909	Good, good.
82929	83910	A little date night?
85163	86125	More of a hanging out.
86225	86886	How cute.
87046	87708	I'm just kidding.
87748	90693	Hey, I think we actually played some more Final Fantasy that night.
90833	93378	Oh, your little Final Fantasy megathon or whatever you're doing?
93398	94480	Yeah, whenever we get back to it.
94721	95562	We got the level up.
96224	96805	The job change.
97318	98159	TechMasterLoki.com
120856	124481	I can't wait until next year when they're all like, we've done all this, who cares?
125763	130549	So sadly, Loki is not here tonight, but filling in for Techmaster Loki, say hello to Salacious Pop.
130669	130989	Hello.
131130	131530	How are you?
131790	132191	I'm great.
132331	134794	Thank you for coming here on kind of a short notice.
135535	136416	So, appreciate it.
136817	137237	DarkSakura.com
161880	163701	But I always thought Easter was kind of done in the morning.
163861	166223	Like, I finished Easter stuff in the morning today.
166323	168665	I had family stuff going on, but that was all in the morning.
168765	169345	So, I don't know.
169985	173408	Well, I mean, I think the real Easter experience is you get up and you go to church.
174308	177871	So, if you're not going to Mass, then you can make it up as you go along.
177891	179752	Mass is like at midnight or something, right?
179832	182194	So, you got plenty of time for OLR still, right?
182234	182734	No, I don't know.
182834	183494	All right, forget it.
184695	187037	I'll quit being a heathen or whatever.
187657	189559	Anyway, let's introduce the chat room.
189639	190179	They're always there.
190379	192680	because really, Jesus died so you could have chocolate.
192880	194960	Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
194980	196201	Marshmallow Peeps.
196241	196441	Ew!
198101	200542	Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
200722	207824	You can chat live with us here on tonight's program and get your little piece in, whatever it is you want to say and so forth.
209024	211105	A handful of people in chat despite the holiday.
211125	220128	Of course, it's a little less than usual and in part you can blame a week off because I'll tell you what, Horde House inadvertently had a week off as well and I'll tell you what, died.
220348	221228	Forums died.
221548	228590	It's like if you do a podcast, I'll tell you what, here's the advice because we get emails once in a while saying, you know, how have you guys stuck with doing a podcast for nine years?
228730	229590	Do you have any advice?
229870	234112	Yeah, my advice, try never to take weeks off unless you absolutely have to because...
235152	236134	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
254019	255580	I played a bunch of stuff.
255660	256980	Well, I played a lot of World of Warcraft.
258061	260301	And two new games appeared on my Steam account today.
261382	270085	The Star Trek DAC and Darwinia, which I have installed, just have not played because I had an epic nap today.
270385	270885	I still got it.
290578	291159	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
309820	337957	and some of that really awesome Terminator gun game and this weird trivia game that I really didn't know much of the answers to because it was like sports and pop culture like the type of pop culture that I don't keep up with and uh what else did I play because I played other stuff I played Droplets when I had my big bad insomnia attack last night except all it really did was make me have to pee and uh
339873	367315	some uh Luminous and uh what else did I play I played something else oh yeah um Peggle Extreme and then watched an entire playthrough of Portal 2 you actually watched the whole thing start to finish huh yes I did wow see I didn't want to ruin it for myself I did that with the last one too did you really that means now I'll have some idea so how to play a little bit more seamlessly so that I do not get too motion sick
368234	374938	So do you find that if you kind of play the YouTubes in advance or whatever that it helps the experience or hurts it?
375018	376038	I think it helps it.
376719	378560	I've been trying very hard to dodge spoilers.
378600	379981	I have not beaten Portal 2 yet.
380621	383142	And I'm really like everybody's like, you got to hear the song.
383162	384603	I'm like, doesn't the song have spoilers?
385083	386764	So not really.
387545	389986	I mean, yeah, it does really give away the ending.
390266	391827	But I'm trying really hard to avoid all that.
391887	392547	So, you know.
392647	392868	Yeah.
394128	395389	But I love it.
397582	400294	My favorite thing so far is Bird Kill It!
402327	405630	So do you know that it's Noble Garden Week in WoW?
406030	406611	She played some WoW.
406631	407091	It's Easter.
407111	408152	It's Easter holiday.
408172	409033	It's one of the easier ones.
409453	410134	I didn't do that.
410214	410734	I'll have to do it.
410814	411435	It's all this week.
411495	412236	It just started today.
412776	413076	Okay.
413617	414718	It's Rob's favorite holiday.
415979	418141	No, my favorite holiday is coming up next week in WoW.
418181	419222	It's Children's Week.
419722	423105	And by favorite, I mean, oh, it's terrible.
423565	428590	And it's the one holiday I need for my Violet Drake because literally last year I said, fuck Children's Week.
428610	429811	I'm not putting up with this bullshit.
430531	431051	Oh, you gotta do it.
431071	432272	And I had to wait an entire year.
433292	433572	Anyhow.
434872	441034	Well, let's... I found, by the way, a dragon that I want that's blue and has transparent wings, looks kind of aquatic.
442094	443414	It might be one of those hard-to-get ones.
443854	444594	I know, but I want it.
445255	445495	All right.
445535	446015	It will be mine.
446415	448075	Let's move on with some other video games.
449416	450736	Salacious Pop, what did you play this week?
452019	458782	I've actually played a lot, considering that usually my schedule is simply WoW, which I'm playing far less of.
459343	464845	I played some Toki Tori because it was a part of the Steam potato bag special.
464885	472889	I had already owned Toki Tori, so they just patched in the potato Portal 2 content because I wanted to try and unlock Portal 2 early.
474229	477291	Even though I didn't really have the means to buy it, I still haven't really played Portal 2 yet.
477811	496475	so Toki Tori, Mortal Kombat beat the story mode and did some just regular one person versus PC fighting on that and some Smash TV some Fatal... Going old school, what made you do Smash TV?
496936	507058	Just when we were I was putting my Xbox Live account on your Xbox and was trying to sync up all the games that you have on it so I was just going through some old stuff on there um
509399	511641	and yeah, that's it really.
513643	515024	What did you think of Mortal Kombat?
515784	517706	I wish the story mode was longer because
519925	530248	All the endless fighting, if there's even just a little bit of dialogue in between, it'll hold my attention more than just doing ladder mode and getting up to the boss and starting all over from scratch.
531068	531868	But yeah, I liked it.
531928	543932	I found a lot of bugs in it, audio bugs, that hopefully they'll be able to patch and fix once a certain system is back online, which we'll get into, I'm sure, in a minute.
544572	570360	um but yeah it's fun it's it's a good uh I mean they pretty much looked at what Street Fighter 4 did and it's like oh that's awesome we should do that for our franchise franchise and it it's working for them so yes and it doesn't hurt that they've had a little bit of a break with Midway having like gone you know under and somebody else had to kind of pick up the series so yeah kind of gave them a little time to think about how to reinvent yeah I think Warner Brothers is I know Warner Brothers published it but um
571638	572378	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
593250	595091	But before that, they were cranking them out.
595192	597313	I think those games have always sold enough.
597833	599194	I don't know if they've ever sold big.
599775	603497	And it really seems like they're trying to get this new one in the series to sell big.
604157	604758	Yeah.
604798	605438	Because we had what?
605458	606579	We had Deadly Alliance.
607460	608500	We had Annihilation.
608560	609801	There was another one in the middle there.
609861	615025	The one that had the Mortal Kombat mini racing kart game was there too.
615425	616246	Oh, yeah.
616386	618947	And Annihilation was the one that had literally everybody.
619568	621749	And then that was kind of the last Mortal Kombat game.
621789	622650	But then they're like, oh.
623450	645895	how do you save a franchise you do a reboot and you know that's literally what they've done literally like that's the story is built around a reboot yeah this is awesome the story mode if you play it from start to finish does the canon the official canon of the first three games and it sets you up for what Mortal Kombat 4 was lore wise at the end of the story mode
647438	650239	Let's go to our chatroom at chat.orangesoundradio.com for some comments.
650559	656240	TigerClaw in our chatroom says the MK story mode is long if you take into account how difficult it was to beat Shao Kahn.
657021	661422	The best strategy was to teleport, uppercut, repeat that, and stay far away until time expires.
662462	664182	Yeah, I did some lightning ball cheese on him.
664683	666963	Just get away, pew pew, I'm gonna pew pew you.
667523	670224	And then he just hopefully doesn't block enough of them to win.
670686	671827	Story Mode Story Mode Story Mode
691120	717266	and Tiger Claw in our chatroom also fills in here with Rob it's like what they did with Star Trek due to the events of the beginning it creates an alternate timeline yeah I mean I don't think that's very spoilery I think that's pretty common knowledge like in story mode I believe people die I haven't gotten that far in my story mode but I believe like people do die I don't want to spoil that for you but you know there's you know big twists and events I believe characters become characters that didn't exist before yeah kind of interesting
717426	718347	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
734928	747243	I really like, and just kind of going into my gaming week, obviously I played Mortal Kombat pretty extensively this week as well, and I do like how they have really brought a lot of the nostalgia.
747563	749706	I mean, I think you commenting like, let's...
750326	751488	Street Fighter 4 Street Fighter 2
769170	769691	Did you bring it?
797174	798257	I didn't bring it tonight.
798717	799178	I'm sorry.
799198	801022	I didn't know you wanted to play it.
801162	805270	I've been watching all of the fatalities in the special, the unlocked characters and everything.
805831	808577	And I found out where all of the hidden coins are.
809147	813830	Yeah, there's a little guide online that we use to get every costume and every, yeah.
814511	823497	If you don't buy any of the extras in the crypt and you just do story mode from start to finish, you have 130,000 of the MK coins.
824438	826299	That's enough to get almost half of the goodies.
826440	828441	It's enough to get all the costumes and the fatalities.
828861	831283	That's cool because I think that there's like another hidden 20,000.
831323	831523	Yeah.
831543	831663	Yeah.
835083	836384	I'm being corrected by our chatroom.
836424	837825	Annihilation was the movie.
837945	839146	Armageddon was the game.
839186	840046	My bad, my bad.
840086	840467	Sorry, guys.
840987	841567	Thanks, Spazinator.
842248	843368	And Wyland chimed in with that, too.
843689	845350	And a comment from Randy in our chatroom.
845650	848412	I felt like the story mode cleared up the events of the franchise.
848492	850433	It was definitely more confusing before.
850933	856677	Yeah, you know, Mortal Kombat kind of always felt like one of those games where they had to kind of write the story to fit what they wanted to do.
857358	859339	And so there were all these weird things going on.
859739	861121	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
877299	880662	Well, just goes to show, don't ever base your opinion of a game off the demo.
880762	881843	Don't ever, ever, ever do that.
882143	883945	Because it was actually really good.
884325	885826	And I've been having a good time with it.
886227	889529	I think there's such a great variety in characters that they've brought in.
889910	893413	Pretty much every single fighter from 1, 2, and 3 are in it, right?
893493	897016	With maybe some very minor, like the boss characters, not all of them are there.
897356	899678	But otherwise, I think every single person...
906127	907807	I think they all show up in the story.
907927	909728	But they had fatalities for him.
909988	910288	Oh, really?
910428	910668	Yeah.
911428	918290	The big centaur dude with the big horse, I think he was the boss of MK3, he's in it in a cutscene, but you don't play as him.
919010	922010	And then Quan Chi from 4 was brought in, so he's playable.
922070	924331	But otherwise, the people from 4 aren't in it yet.
924711	935093	Yeah, although DLC might change some of that, because a character that was introduced in Deadly Alliance, who's actually one of my favorite characters, Kenshi, is one of the first download characters, the blind ninja guy.
935393	936493	I was watching the Fatalities for Kratos
953960	981996	mm-hmm yeah Kratos is in the game pretty hard he obviously fits right in yeah I gotta say though like you know he just he plays like any other character which I think is a compliment I mean you don't want a character like Kratos to be gimmicky or stick out like a sore thumb but I mean like the whole like painting his body white and everything well Quan Chi does that shit too so he kind of fits right in with everybody else it's a better promotional exclusive thing than I don't know Darth Vader and Yoda and Soul Calibur 4 mm-hmm
982436	986798	Well, and also, the other thing that... Who was it?
987678	988778	I just lost my train of thought.
988858	996041	It was somebody else that's in there that... Noob and Ermac were... Ermac's hardcore.
996081	1000162	...were fandom rumors that they actually made real characters, yeah.
1000481	1004443	I love that Ermac's fatality with the spikes.
1004884	1005084	Yeah.
1005304	1006084	That one's really cool.
1006545	1010687	LeoShed is in our chatroom saying, no Rain, otherwise they would have all of Trilogy.
1010747	1013669	Yeah, Rain is one of the most notable characters that's missing.
1013729	1021334	But to be honest, because they've done so much with the other ninjas, like, you know, Cyrax and Sektor are not just palette swaps.
1021514	1023635	Like, you know, they are fully developed ninjas.
1024496	1028158	They start in story mode as humans and you can unlock their human forms.
1028438	1030340	So they are all very different characters.
1030400	1037465	So I can see why they probably cut Rain because while he was a cool character, he was really tacked into Trilogy.
1037765	1038566	He was purple.
1038886	1043629	Yeah, he was the purple palette swap that had a couple cool moves with a neat name.
1043889	1046912	Otherwise, he was really forced in the story.
1047212	1048813	I would bet he's DLC later on though.
1049233	1050254	I remember what I was going to say.
1051234	1064783	One of Shang Tsung's fatalities was actually his DC, his Mortal Kombat versus DC fatality, except it's the whole thing, because they cut it to where you only see him turn into a clown, and then you don't see the other person explode.
1064963	1065143	Right.
1065283	1066544	They showed the full fatality.
1067164	1067604	Oh, okay.
1067624	1069525	So, because people are like, what happened?
1069565	1070446	So they actually put that in there.
1070706	1074168	The fatalities in this game are a little silly as they're supposed to be very over the top.
1074389	1075569	Babalities are in there.
1075810	1077111	The babalities are cute!
1077251	1079892	But friendships are not, which kind of surprised me.
1080033	1080693	I was very sad.
1080773	1082754	No animalities or any of the other weird stuff either.
1082774	1084216	I was really sad friendships weren't there.
1084756	1085937	I always loved those in Mortal Kombat 2.
1086577	1088479	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1107032	1108433	But it's definitely influence.
1108473	1109893	But it's really cool.
1110113	1113215	It adds to the battle exactly what it does in Street Fighter IV.
1113355	1118677	If you are behind, this gives you a chance to really level the playing field if your opponent has a moment of weakness.
1119017	1122419	And the x-ray attacks look really cool, and it makes the battle flow really well.
1122759	1128041	And I think that's where this game really shines, is that the battles flow so well.
1129002	1133784	They're fun to play, and the fatalities give that sense of edge to it.
1133804	1134664	There's a lot at stake.
1135284	1157806	um and then you know where this Mortal Kombat really shines is where a lot of the prior Mortal Kombat games have really shined and that is uh the robustness of what is offered in the title you've got your story mode you've got your challenge ladder with what like 300 challenges you've got the crypt thing which the crypt thing's been done better in other versions of the game I think but whatever it's still there
1159326	1185093	you know you have different modes to play and the tag team thing kind of comes out of nowhere too they kind of took that whole idea from I guess you could say Marvel vs. Capcom or whatever but now you have teams of two and you can do assists and all that stuff so it's pretty cool it's like Mortal Kombat has really been invigorated it's been infused with some of the best parts of other fighters and it's made for a pretty awesome experience one of my favorite Mortal Kombat games in recent memory the best one of all time is
1186033	1186953	I think that's still two.
1187473	1188254	Two beta.
1188474	1191955	It's one of those that's going to be hard to top.
1192015	1195416	But it's worth checking out, if nothing else.
1196056	1202178	And a lot of people like to point and laugh at Mortal Kombat in the fighting world, but I think this one shows that there's a lot here to take seriously.
1202618	1203558	Two beta was great.
1204018	1204298	Was it?
1204338	1205919	With Katana's infinite combo.
1205939	1205979	So...
1210238	1213879	TigerClaw in our chatroom says, Rob, regarding animalities, at least one of them is in there.
1213919	1215340	It's one of Liu Kang's fatalities.
1216040	1219881	That's true, but wasn't it also a fatality in Mortal Kombat 2?
1220322	1222802	I think that's what inspired it, not necessarily the animalities.
1223483	1225083	Anyhow, other games I played this week.
1225103	1235167	I don't want to talk just about Mortal Kombat because I haven't had a chance to play Mortal Kombat online because of certain outages, but I have had a chance to check out Portal 2.
1236167	1254042	Portal 2 is, you know, I played the first game and played, you know, that game pretty extensively and it was always a pretty cool concept and, you know, when I heard they were making a sequel, I knew it was going to be pretty interesting and I've been playing through the single player mode and I really don't know what to say.
1254302	1255303	I honestly think...
1256624	1266147	games like Super Mario Brothers, Final Fantasy 7, games that have been like landmark for that generation.
1266647	1269148	I honestly think Portal 2 fits into that for this generation.
1269308	1270849	I think this is like a...
1272029	1273090	Thank you for watching!
1296750	1297370	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1321596	1331966	I was really expecting it to just be kind of a continuation of Portal 1 where you would just have more test chambers and explore the story a little more.
1332026	1336010	But there's much more here than just more test chambers.
1336471	1337712	And that's all I'm really going to say.
1338152	1339253	Although there are a lot of those.
1339433	1342415	There are a lot of those, but there's much more.
1342535	1351461	This game digs beneath the surface, and I don't just mean beneath the surface of the test chambers, which you do get to see as well, which is really cool.
1352362	1358686	GLaDOS as a character is legendary in the world of video games.
1360407	1366191	I have done the blue repulsion gel a couple times.
1366431	1367872	So you've seen Potato?
1368513	1371575	The Big Mutated Potato is Supposed to be Shell's Project
1399948	1400248	Interesting.
1400268	1400588	Oh, wow.
1401629	1401929	All right.
1403871	1407514	So, anyway, some comments in our chatroom, chat.orange.radio.com.
1407875	1413920	Randy in our chatroom says, Watching Portal for the first time made me think, how does someone have the mental capacity to figure out these puzzles?
1414220	1415421	You know, a lot of it's trial and error.
1415501	1421867	I noticed that the second game really limits where you can put portals more than the first game did, and that's part of the puzzles.
1422207	1422627	But, I mean...
1423528	1430511	They've added all this other stuff into it, like the lasers, the light bridges, the gel is a huge thing.
1430531	1433072	I got stuck on one puzzle because of that stupid gel.
1433112	1439055	I couldn't figure out how to... I didn't figure out that you could actually make gel fly through the walls that destroy things.
1439115	1440516	Otherwise, I would have figured it out a lot sooner.
1441216	1443177	and just crazy stuff.
1443637	1450100	You really have to look around for surfaces that could be a mile high up for you to fling a portal onto.
1450940	1454842	It is really an experience to play a game like Portal.
1454862	1457242	I really don't know what else to say.
1457303	1460284	The game is outstanding and it's well worth your money.
1461264	1467748	If you haven't bought it yet, I guess you already know this is probably the type of game that maybe just isn't for you for whatever reason or, you know, obviously economical, whatever stuff.
1467908	1469609	$60 is still a huge investment.
1470090	1472751	But I don't know what else to say.
1472791	1475973	I think most people who want it already went and got it first day.
1476313	1477434	The Steam integration is great.
1477714	1481297	I was really surprised at how well Steam integrates with the PlayStation 3.
1482117	1486559	But you can hit select, then it brings up the Steam thing, and it's just like being logged into Steam.
1487020	1488240	I don't know what else to say.
1488601	1489621	It was pretty seamless.
1489641	1495324	You connect your PlayStation Network account to Steam, and then that's it.
1495484	1503028	You can hit select, and I can see all my Steam friends and who's on, and it's just like I'm playing another Steam game, but it's on my PlayStation 3.
1503989	1509632	Now, I was wondering, if someone picked this up, used, they wouldn't be able to get the Steam...
1512671	1513212	Link, would they?
1514052	1517656	There is a card that comes with the game that has the code on it.
1517696	1519778	So sadly, no, you wouldn't be able to get it.
1520138	1522180	You'd have to buy it new in order to get to both games.
1522821	1530027	And it says somehow that... It says on the back of the box, you cannot play co-op on your PC and PS3.
1531028	1531369	I don't know.
1531469	1533070	See, I haven't really explored that yet.
1533090	1534131	Maybe somebody in our chat knows.
1534972	1537454	And I would imagine a lot of that is because of the Steam hookup.
1537935	1542960	If I log into Steam on my PS3, it's not going to let me do it on my PC as well to play the same game.
1543380	1546743	But what would happen if I have two PlayStation 3 accounts?
1547003	1549826	Like, for example, Salacious Pop uses my PlayStation...
1551447	1570124	3 as well what if he connected that to his Steam and then played on my PS3 and then I played Steam on my computer maybe that would work I don't know because I can't imagine that this discs are imprinted with the serial number somehow so unless hooking up Steam hooks up the whole console to that Steam ID I would think you could have that
1570845	1571146	I don't know.
1572668	1575231	I'm going to be honest.
1575271	1576773	I haven't even really played it on Steam.
1576994	1579177	I've been completely satiated with the PS3 version.
1579237	1581099	I don't really need the Steam version.
1581159	1581960	It's nice to have.
1582541	1585165	It's a cool little bonus, but I didn't really need it.
1586564	1589546	Yeah, I'm waiting until I can play it on PC because I'm like that.
1590487	1592048	I need the mouse and WASD.
1592348	1595931	After playing both versions of Portal, it really is a lot easier to play on the PC.
1596371	1600594	See, but see, and this all goes back to joystick versus mouse and keyboard.
1600954	1602435	Some people prefer mouse and keyboard.
1602536	1604637	I love the DualShock controller for playing it.
1604737	1605298	It's awesome.
1605818	1606358	Great for me.
1606739	1606839	So...
1609071	1612015	Spazinator in our chatroom says, is the cake still a lie in Portal 2?
1612876	1617323	No, there is one joke that is blink and you miss it sort of thing.
1617643	1622990	And I like that they did that because they didn't try to keep the same joke going through the whole thing.
1623191	1624072	I really like that.
1624820	1647422	GLaDOS has some new insults and some of them are real good like she consistently makes fat jokes about you which are just outstanding I love the GLaDOS cutdowns like some of them are really harsh all I'll say there's one surprise yes the surprise when the confetti blows I was dying dying alright let's see next time there will be real confetti
1650163	1660372	Go to our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com Bonds006 says, Like the Xbox 360 recovery game tag ability from Sony?
1660473	1660933	No, Rob.
1660973	1661534	Stop hoping.
1662114	1663916	I don't think that's exactly what I'm talking about.
1664036	1666859	Although, yeah, it is a little weird that you can...
1669738	1673362	We're having this problem now that we have two Xbox 360s in our house.
1674063	1679289	If we put the live on one, we have to migrate the account to play on the other Xbox every time.
1679670	1680711	It's a little irritating.
1681632	1682072	It's weird.
1683334	1686538	Frisbee in our chatroom says the console versions should let you use keyboard and mouse.
1688032	1688512	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1712362	1713043	Thank you for watching!
1731056	1733056	All the little modes they put in that.
1733977	1737178	Loki kind of reviewed the title on the show before, so I'm not going to rehash everything.
1737218	1741700	But I do like that they've put in a street pass feature where you can fight things.
1741740	1745122	It gives you incentive to keep playing, so you can collect these little trophies.
1745742	1752385	They're different from achievements, but the little trophies are what you use in street pass mode to help fight other people and so forth.
1752825	1767853	and 3DS as a system I'm liking it so far I feel like there's so much more potential there that we're going to unlock what in May when they do some of the patches there's a lot in the interface where you hit the button and it says this feature is not yet available it will be installed through a system update
1768573	1769634	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1796556	1800279	And I had some issues with the facial recognition.
1801620	1813831	It'll make your little me avatar by taking a picture of yourself, you square your head in the frame, and it thinks that I have really huge jowls.
1815232	1816813	My head looked like a bell.
1816913	1819975	My 3DS is apparently GLaDOS because it was calling you fat.
1820176	1820736	Yeah, it was.
1821196	1822877	I think because I'm rocking a beard right now.
1824439	1827240	And I think it just thought that my facial hair was face.
1827861	1829182	So it's like, yeah.
1829778	1830078	DarkSakura.com
1854822	1856983	Alright, so gosh, I think I've covered about everything.
1857223	1860524	I have Final Fantasy 4, the complete edition on order as well.
1860864	1866446	I was frugal in my shopping and I went on Amazon.com and bought Mortal Kombat and Portal 2.
1866886	1870848	And so I got like $20 credit for buying one and $10 credit for buying the other.
1871568	1876551	I usually don't give shoutouts to retail chains like that because, you know, we're a commercial free show.
1876871	1879052	But I just got to say, as a gamer, I was pretty impressed.
1879352	1880953	They only charged me four bucks for shipping.
1881213	1882754	They had the games there on release day.
1883034	1888397	I got $30 worth of free credit, which I used to buy the Final Fantasy IV Complete Collection, which was the other game I wanted this week.
1888477	1889337	So, win!
1890558	1891498	Hey, I'm all for good deals.
1891939	1892319	Exactly.
1893652	1903981	Alright, let's see, going to our chatroom again, chat.orangeloungeradio.com, Bonds006 in our chat agrees, yeah, the me on the 3DDS does make you look not like yourself.
1905362	1919074	Tigerclaw says, regarding the street pass, so far it's been working, I go about four miles from street pass, but the fine me still, oh, I don't know, oh, I think I got about four me's from street pass, but the fine me still won't let me use them.
1919995	1924218	How many StreetPass Miis do you need in order for Find Me to work without buying the heroes?
1924538	1925098	Good question.
1925138	1926039	I haven't figured that out yet.
1926079	1929361	I just got the 3DS last night, so I have yet to run into people.
1929401	1934243	I haven't gone to the mall or anything or a place where other gamers are where I've had StreetPass.
1934584	1936605	I've just bought the Miis.
1936805	1943429	And what I mean by that, the 3DS has a built-in game called Find Me, and it's a little chibi role-playing game.
1943689	1944830	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1971806	1972307	Thanks for watching!
1992712	1994835	All right, so let's move on.
1995656	1999961	Oh, BlackWolf in our chatroom says, I got one Mii and I used him on Find Mii.
2000301	2003945	So I guess maybe there's something the Tigerclaw missed in that.
2004005	2004366	I don't know.
2004846	2006728	So yeah, I got to try and get more Mii's.
2006748	2009892	I was hoping Loki would be here so we could street pass the DSs, but oh well.
2010312	2011574	Easter's more important, I suppose.
2012870	2018772	Anyhow, we're going to move into some gaming news, but first some quick plugs for where you can find us around the internet.
2018812	2025495	We are on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR, as well as Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
2026035	2030056	And of course, once again, we do tape live at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.
2030316	2032297	If you've never joined us for a live show, why not?
2033581	2035002	You should sometime at some point.
2035282	2036963	All right, let's get into tonight's gaming news.
2037263	2039764	So Pop's going to start us off tonight since he's filling in for Loki.
2040224	2054571	This is a huge story that's been covered most major avenues for gaming news, and that is the fact that on Wednesday night, the PlayStation Network went down like a drunk, vicarious frat boy at a Jack Jansen concert.
2054631	2055691	It's just gone.
2056091	2056572	It's gone.
2059173	2068038	Wednesday night, no PSN, no store, no curiosity store or anything like that.
2068499	2074562	And Sony confirmed that it was because of an external intrusion, which means they got to haxed.
2075503	2080746	Someone got into the system in a bad way and brought the whole thing down.
2080846	2083408	And I guess I'm given the statement that...
2085729	2091619	Sibold put out it sounds like they're completely rebuilding their
2092918	2094078	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2116064	2142594	and the Portal 2 obviously you know they the Gabe Newell got up there at E3 and said okay my bad on PlayStation my bad guys it's actually going to be the system you're going to want to own Portal 2 on remember that and so and obviously with the Steam integration it's pretty great and so I kind of wonder how that plays into it like maybe just the fact that now all of a sudden all these folks who maybe own both systems were like opting for the PS3 versions and
2142795	2146250	in conjunction with whatever else is going on behind the scenes brought it down.
2147543	2152924	Yeah, I'm sure you know there are people at Valve that, I don't want to say they're pissed, but it's there.
2153224	2167807	It's a huge release for Valve, and the authoritative console version, you can't do co-op on it right now because of Sony, so I'm sure they've got all these developers, not just Valve, breathing down their neck, going, how did this happen?
2168327	2175668	Consumers are worried that if the hack was this bad that it would bring down their entire network for five days.
2176508	2178130	Do they have access to customer records?
2178230	2181493	Because a lot of people have their credit cards saved because they like just the one-click purchase.
2182033	2187198	I got to admit, that makes me very nervous because, yeah, all right, mine's on there.
2187538	2193623	And I'm a little worried about this because, you know, if that information got out, I want to know.
2194624	2198868	And I need Sony to be communicating a little better than like, yeah, we're down because we got hacked.
2198948	2199609	No shit.
2200209	2201430	We all read the internet.
2201890	2205753	Even CNN was reporting about how Anonymous was attacking PlayStation Network.
2206173	2213538	And whether they're responsible for this or not, I mean, Sony has an obligation to tell me exactly what information of mine is out there.
2213718	2219842	California has some pretty strict consumer rights laws involving statements made about their information.
2219862	2222364	I think the federal government has some pretty strict laws on that stuff.
2222404	2223445	It's not just California.
2223485	2225146	Many states do.
2225206	2226807	But yeah, I mean, obviously.
2227267	2229349	But the bummer is, I think,
2230390	2233373	You can report up to 90 days after the incident.
2234154	2235255	And I'm sorry, Sony.
2235275	2236396	I want to know now.
2236517	2237878	Stop giving all this fluff.
2238038	2239720	What exactly is happening?
2240061	2241722	We're going on four to five days now.
2242263	2242804	You know, and...
2245426	2252231	We kind of joke about how on this show a lot of times the system will go down for a day or two and it's always like nobody ever remembers.
2252611	2256474	Nobody ever remembers that Xbox went down right after Halo 3 came out too.
2257815	2262137	Gamers pretty much overlook this stuff because once it's fixed then they can play their games.
2262558	2267801	But this is starting to go on one of those things where it's getting harder and harder to say you're just going to easily forget this.
2268182	2272244	Especially if we find out that our information was at risk.
2272544	2274486	That is going to be a huge
2276770	2284046	and GameStop will breathe a huge sigh of relief because they'll be open that much longer.
2284716	2314063	I think with the Xbox they've had the gold which is the for pay platform you know for Xbox Live that's been around longer more people depend on that for the co-op play and for Netflix whereas the PSN you know you post your trophies and you do some matching service on it but PSN because it doesn't have I mean if you don't buy the download games from PSN there's really no reason for them to have your credit card information whereas on the Xbox Live service you need a credit card for gold period
2315224	2332622	I actually don't put any of my information in those if I can help it because with Xbox you put it in there they will find a way that even if you unintentionally press something they're still going to charge you so it's best not to have it in there at all just buy the points through the internet
2332842	2343754	For the PlayStation Network, what I would do is I would, I don't know if you can do this anymore, but I would go onto the site, the website, PlayStation Network, put some money in my bucket or whatever, then buy the game through the PS3.
2344174	2347538	That way I can do a one-time transaction and they don't have my credit card saved in there.
2348139	2349300	Because otherwise I don't trust it.
2349502	2349982	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2367308	2373890	This is really interesting because this just pulls back this whole other layer of what is anonymous all about?
2374110	2382993	Because of the fact that they don't have a face, they are anonymous, so to speak, it is so easy for the media to blame them for this, which is what's happening.
2383013	2387794	They may not be responsible, but they're getting the blame for this because there's no one to defend anonymous because they're anonymous.
2388054	2389615	And that adds actually to their notoriety.
2390885	2393026	Yeah, as I understand it... They're probably eating it up.
2393567	2401732	As I understand it, a couple weeks ago when the Geohots verdict came down, they did a couple days of DDoS attacks, which is where they flood the system with requests.
2402272	2402853	That was it.
2403353	2412519	So this thing that just brought the whole thing down like a house of cards, they're like, it's not whoever the people that... Yeah, whoever the mouthpiece is, whoever's calling the shots...
2412839	2413339	DarkSakura.com
2429051	2430652	This isn't the notoriety that they want.
2430732	2436175	They don't want to be responsible for the consumers because that's who they were trying to defend in the first place with this whole Geohots thing.
2436655	2444820	But unfortunately, how easy is it for the not-as-tech-savvy media, mainstream media, to just say, well, it's Anonymous' fault.
2445120	2448522	They said they put out these videos and Anonymous, Anonymous, Anonymous, Anonymous.
2448882	2453124	I mean, maybe they like having their name out there, but I don't necessarily think this is what they wanted their name on.
2453504	2455945	But because Anonymous has no mouthpiece...
2457046	2460269	This could be a whole subset of the group that's doing this.
2460529	2462150	And we just don't know.
2463111	2463752	It's interesting.
2463872	2468976	That whole politics or whatever you want to call it behind it is fascinating.
2469757	2476723	And just to get to the meat and potatoes of this story, Patrick Sebald, who is the head of PR for Sony, this is his actual statement on it.
2478184	2485030	Quote, "...an external intrusion on our system has affected our PlayStation Network and Curiosity Services."
2485570	2502485	in order to conduct a thorough investigation and to verify the smooth and secure operation of our network services going forward we turned off PlayStation Network and Curiosity Services on the evening of Wednesday, April 20th providing quality entertainment services to our customers and partners is our utmost priority
2505074	2519510	that's their that's all they got to say about it part of me is kind of like something really bad happened this is much more than a DDOS attack because if that was the case we would not be sitting down talking about reconstructing the whole fucking thing
2520751	2541899	during Easter weekend which is the start of spring break when you have two of your biggest titles out that is why I'm sitting here going I think private information was breached and I think it's going to come out in the next week that that's what happened and that kind of worries me like otherwise your timing is just ridiculous Sony
2542199	2552464	As someone with a sales analyst background, the fact that their store is offline, like, oh yeah, that's no revenue for a week.
2553724	2560107	Even a company as big as Sony that makes billions of dollars a year, if you don't make a penny for five days, you will feel it.
2560687	2562188	So yeah, it's pretty serious.
2562748	2565129	Alright, well let's move on with some more stories.
2565189	2577856	This one kind of came up while we were off last week, but it's just, speaking of demons with multiple heads or whatever you want to call it, this is a story that's just been going on and on over the past couple weeks that, you know, we didn't have a show last week, and that is...
2578536	2581157	The rumored new Nintendo console.
2581257	2587919	A new Nintendo console is rumored to be debuting at E3 this June, supposedly launching in 2012.
2588339	2591400	It's supposed to be more powerful, obviously, than the Wii.
2591960	2603383	A lot of talk about how it's supposed to be scary similar to the Xbox 360, where if you develop a game for the 360, it's supposed to be just that much easier for you to develop for whatever this new Nintendo console is.
2603903	2621308	um these uh leaks are coming from Game Informer who I believe was sorting a French site in their uh news which was the same French site that I believe broke the story on the PSP Go so it's kind of one of those things where like if the site was true before they're probably right again you know
2621488	2628313	I'm kind of sad Loki's not here because I swear to God, if you go back in the archives and listen to a show in January, I told him,
2647515	2654781	I said, Nintendo's going to announce a new console at E3 this year And he's like, no they're not, the Wii's still printing money I said, what do they have coming out on the Wii?
2655062	2665310	There is no big title on the Wii right now Except Zelda, that is it And now they've pushed Zelda back What's the real reason Zelda just got pushed back everybody?
2665971	2670074	That game was ready to roll, I'll bet you anything But now it's been pushed back, why?
2670795	2673057	It's getting the same treatment that the last Zelda game did
2674474	2675075	Guarantee it.
2677438	2680323	It's going to be multi-console just like the last one.
2680523	2684068	Oh, I wanted him to be here so bad so I could point out, I told you so, I told you so.
2684889	2689155	But yeah, honestly, I kind of see this as kind of a duh.
2689836	2693918	What else did Nintendo have to talk about at E3 this year as far as consoles go?
2694019	2697040	I mean, I should say living room consoles go.
2697240	2707867	The 3DS, obviously, is going to be the... Clearly, they're going to roll out the Mario game and the Kid Icarus game, and those are going to be their big titles that are going to sell more this year as they talk about Netflix and some of the other multimedia.
2707907	2709127	Guaranteed, you're going to see that.
2709788	2716091	Whatever way we can make nine-year-olds want to have a 3DS, they're going to try to sell as many of those under the Christmas tree as they can.
2716131	2716892	More Pokemans.
2717612	2721753	Yeah, and rumor is there's going to be a Pokemon announcement at some point as well.
2721853	2727335	So I would peg that a little closer to Tokyo Game Show, but sure, that's inevitable as well.
2727355	2728775	Pokemon Plaid and Polka Dot.
2729935	2730876	Pokemon 3D!
2732996	2737017	But as far as living room consoles go, it's been dead on Nintendo's front.
2737057	2738658	I mean, even with the Zelda game...
2739418	2749931	If that game was really coming out soon, we would be flooded with more screenshots and videos and things of that nature.
2750051	2752434	So guarantee it, there's a new console in the works.
2752654	2755858	Nintendo has to play catch-up in some regards to this.
2756098	2756719	It prints money.
2757319	2758981	Well, there's even more rumors that...
2761578	2769162	There's even more rumors that follow up with this, and some of it has to do with the controller, I suppose, that's going to be with this system.
2769982	2778407	Apparently, by the way, they're calling this whole thing Project Cafe, which I guess is like Dolphin was for the GameCube, right?
2778467	2779287	Or was that the 64?
2779727	2781848	And then Revolution was the codename for Wii.
2781888	2783589	The Saturn was the Katana, I think.
2784170	2786871	This will not be called Project Cafe when it comes out, guaranteed.
2787992	2792195	Yeah, Saturn was Katana, but then when they were doing pre for Dreamcast, it was Neptune.
2792895	2793296	That's right.
2793676	2801041	They will do some very weird name that is very one-syllable type of easy thing, just like, you know, Wii was.
2801061	2802121	They'll do something like that.
2802542	2806805	But anyway, supposedly the controller is supposed to be like an iPad with buttons.
2807385	2811768	Eight buttons, two analog sticks, a camera, a 6.2-inch touchscreen.
2812208	2817752	That's kind of weird because that means the controllers themselves would cost several hundred dollars.
2818632	2820653	if they're as fancy as everyone thinks they are.
2820733	2827155	Now, see, part of me says I don't necessarily think they're as good as an iPad or an iPod because you know what I think about?
2827255	2836619	I've seen these printers for sale at Fry's that have a removable touchscreen type of thing that you can take from the printer and actually look at the devices and the screen.
2836759	2838559	It's okay, but it's kind of cheap.
2839020	2845242	I think that is more what this is going to look like if this is even true because the problem with this is that now that you have...
2845842	2850265	These rumors that look like they're going to be true, everybody's sucking on to it.
2850646	2856310	And now you're going to see fake pictures, fake, everybody's going to just have a field day with this.
2856550	2858051	I'm just thinking of the VMU now.
2858996	2859196	Yeah.
2859617	2861958	And that's what a lot of people are saying, too.
2862339	2863159	That would make sense.
2863319	2866282	And I honestly, I played little things on my VMU.
2867122	2871506	I was trying to raise my chao in Japanese.
2872527	2874628	And the Final Fantasy... Oh, wait, no.
2876030	2877491	There's the Pocket Station, too.
2878151	2880613	Yeah, I totally just switched up platforms there.
2880633	2883636	That had that really cool thing, integration with the second Rival Schools.
2884096	2884276	Yeah.
2884817	2885857	The Evolution Disc.
2886478	2886658	Yeah.
2887768	2903031	and also Nintendo has kind of ever since the GameCube they've been the more affordable family friendly option so they can't go all high tech and put out you know a $600 system because that's going to go against what their business model has been for like 7 years now
2903391	2903851	I agree.
2903931	2906113	This has to be a cheap system.
2906733	2912096	They could probably get away with selling it for $300, maybe $400 if it's that fucking good.
2912557	2915038	But it's going to have to be cheaper than an iPad.
2915358	2916959	You know, how much was the Wii when it first came out?
2917279	2916959	$250.
2917319	2918780	But of course, it was supposed to be the budget system.
2918860	2919761	And it was a steal, yeah.
2921101	2941608	I honestly don't see them putting out such an expensive piece of technology as a controller I truly think if this is even true I really think you're looking at something like those printers and the portable because those printers are only like $300 and they have that little device you take right off of them so I think we're looking at something more like that they're all going to have Game Boy Micros attached to them
2943018	2947322	Well, whatever will help them sell more virtual console games.
2947742	2952026	I would think your 3DS would be the ideal controller for this system.
2953197	2955519	If they really want to have that synergy.
2956039	2958261	Like, remember back in the day.
2959362	2962645	Remember the Advance had the link cable to the GameCube?
2962905	2965087	We needed it for Animal Crossing to do the island.
2965307	2967769	And sadly, there were three games that used it.
2968109	2968809	Animal Crossing.
2968890	2969330	Pac-Man.
2969690	2970651	The Pac-Man Versus.
2970971	2971812	And Zelda.
2971912	2974854	Sonic Adventure 2 and the Sonic Advance game.
2974934	2975835	Oh, I forgot about the Sonic games.
2975855	2976816	Did the Chao trading.
2976836	2976916	Yeah.
2977537	2989129	and then you can do weird things like unlock original Metroid but I don't consider that a full feature that's just, you know quick tangent about the Wii real quick it's hooked up now at your place for the first time in like 16 months
2989986	2990406	Yes, I did.
2990446	2992408	I hooked up the Wii for the first time in 16 months.
2992448	2993408	And what did I play on it?
2994189	2995049	I think Super Metroid.
2995149	2996290	We also hooked up the Super Nintendo.
2996310	2998272	I found my bonafide Super Nintendo.
2998532	3001614	We were playing Mortal Kombat, like the real Mortal Kombat.
3001634	3002955	So that was kind of cool.
3004115	3006117	So I'm a little distracted right now.
3006157	3010640	I don't want to call this breaking news or whatever, but I just have to throw this out here because I know DarkSakura is going to be interested in this.
3011080	3016564	And Miglatov, if you're listening, which I know you are, you need to post this link in chat because he's showing me graphics from Phantasy Star Online 2.
3016984	3019866	Yeah, my friend Krista posted those images today.
3020066	3021526	I guess more information came out on this.
3021687	3023707	I have not seen this at all.
3023727	3025488	Technically, she posted them yesterday from Japan.
3025808	3027988	There's more information on 4gamer.net.
3028568	3036351	This looks like Universe, kind of, but in high def and these cool little screens.
3036491	3039311	I miss Phantasy Star Online.
3039872	3044353	I do, too, and there was just something missing in Phantasy Star Universe, so I hope Sega's figured it out.
3046872	3047452	Who am I kidding?
3047472	3048753	I'm going to get that game when it comes out.
3048793	3049574	I'm not even going to lie.
3051475	3052695	Oh, Ziba reminded me.
3052755	3055777	Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles 2 for the Game Boy Advance as a controller.
3055797	3056277	That's right.
3056818	3057738	I guess there were a few.
3058298	3059539	Not just one or two games.
3060460	3063701	And Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles was a pretty cool game, too.
3064342	3070565	Those were all games that very few people ever really got to experience because the setup for it was so damn expensive.
3071025	3072886	But yeah, the Crystal Chronicles thing was so cool.
3073727	3074968	So, all right.
3076288	3079030	Anyhow, one other rumor about the new Nintendo system.
3079110	3085894	Supposedly, Nintendo is trying to make nice nice with Rockstar, trying to get them to develop for the Wii 2.
3087175	3093739	And this is a report from, what is this, Zero One Net, which I think is also GoNintendo.
3093799	3095320	I don't know, it's all over the internet somewhere.
3096081	3111802	saying that Rockstar apparently is being courted for Grand Theft Auto 5 to release in 2012 2012 is supposed to be when Grand Theft Auto 5 comes out and Nintendo is supposedly courting them to release the game on this new Nintendo system as well
3112162	3113522	Which really, it makes sense.
3113962	3116103	And it's not like Rockstar hates Nintendo.
3116463	3119444	Rockstar put out that mediocre Grand Theft Auto game on the DS.
3119924	3121524	Remember the Chinatown Wars or whatever?
3121864	3125425	So it would not be unheard of for Rockstar to develop for the Nintendo console.
3125765	3132327	But I think if Nintendo wanted to be serious about the whole, hey, we're going back for the hardcore gamer this year...
3133207	3153409	and you know maybe that'll be Reggie's angle when he takes E3 stage we've made a gaming console for everybody we've made a gaming console for those that want to play their Wii games on HD we've made a gaming console for kids we've made a gaming console for the hardcore gamer you want proof we're getting Grand Theft Auto 5 bet you never thought you'd hear me saying that you know that's not gonna happen
3153894	3168659	Well, he won't say it like that, but, oh, I think Grand Theft Auto V, if the rumors are true about that this is as easy to develop for us, the Xbox 360 and so forth, or they have that synergy because of the hardware that both systems are using, I think this is absolutely true.
3169820	3174101	But, I think this is also part of fanboy wank.
3174862	3176082	It kind of blurs the line.
3176122	3178243	I think it's obvious fanboy wank.
3178743	3182469	You know how sometimes sites will report on things that are kind of obvious?
3183170	3185594	I think this falls in that category, to be honest.
3186679	3204210	You know what I kind of wish that more companies would do because it's one of the things that made the Dreamcast easy to develop on is the fact that it would build in a Windows CE environment and every time a Dreamcast game would load that was built in Windows CE it installed the newest version of Windows CE and then played the game.
3204870	3210534	So you always had your system OS tailored to the game that you were playing.
3211755	3215897	All right, again, going to our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com is where you want to be.
3215997	3219718	Or you visit our website at www.orangeloungeradio.com and click on chat.
3220298	3224600	We're on the Game Surge Network on channel Orange Lounge is where you want to be.
3224660	3225601	That's our official chat room.
3226981	3232703	Some comments there saying, Ksan in our chat room says, Chinatown Wars was not mediocre from what I've heard.
3232904	3234904	I'm just going off Loki, who's like the biggest scram.
3234924	3235845	That's Auto Addict, I know.
3235905	3236145	Sorry.
3237385	3250491	DDR Dollar Bill says Chinatown Wars was just too dark to play and Randy in our chatroom says Nico Bellic in next Super Smash Brothers now that that could be an interesting set of talks
3252245	3280779	you know what going with the fanboy wank and this whole thing you know obviously the Zelda game will be one of the games that has a hybrid thing going on with the next console but if they really want me to just lose my shit on whatever this new console is how about that new F-Zero game already huh now that you're gonna be all high def and stuff give me a new F-Zero game why not no seriously the original F-Zero was a launch title for Super Nintendo so it's not unheard of that F-Zero could be a launch title oh yeah
3282097	3284761	F-Zero and Pilotwings in Mario World were the original launch titles.
3286624	3288326	I remember because I wanted them all.
3290690	3291171	So there you go.
3291940	3294401	Well, how about something else that was on the SNES?
3294601	3294981	How about it?
3295661	3307125	And we've already mentioned Final Fantasy, but Final Fantasy VI, which was released in the US initially as Final Fantasy III, it is coming out on Virtual Console and PlayStation Network.
3308425	3311746	So it is going to be there available to play.
3312786	3316307	And I don't, however, see a date attached to this.
3317568	3321689	In fact, I am trying to see if there's a date on the article, and it does not
3321969	3324030	The release date is soon.
3324270	3325030	Yeah, it's soon.
3325550	3335934	But it is also going to have the full motion video that came with the PlayStation updates with the Chronicles.
3336114	3339836	Oh, it's like the opera scene and the Kefkas Tower and a few others.
3340416	3342417	Hopefully it won't have the shitty loading times.
3342904	3349290	Well, if it's going to be playing on PlayStation Network, it's probably going to be something you're downloading, so you won't have to worry about that.
3349811	3352593	If it's all off the hard drive, then the load time should be minimal.
3352633	3353834	Depending on the emulator.
3353894	3354275	I don't know.
3354335	3355636	I don't know how that all fits in.
3356377	3357898	We've also put Flickr in here.
3358599	3358819	Yeah.
3359259	3363423	No, I've already got 50 million copies of this plus the original, so...
3364758	3371521	Yeah, I've got a ROM, the cart, and then the GBA port.
3371741	3373602	I will probably still buy it.
3373742	3375943	I will still buy it because I'm a consumer whore.
3376223	3376584	And how?
3376744	3381006	And Final Fantasy VI is so fucking good.
3381146	3385128	It's so good.
3386248	3389129	That was the game when I was 17, 18 years old.
3390785	3394766	Now, I told you about how I stayed home from school for a week to play it.
3396387	3397527	By telling everyone I had the flu.
3398667	3405129	Final Fantasy VII, people hate on Final Fantasy VII because it's not more Final Fantasy VI.
3405789	3406450	Let's be honest.
3406690	3410351	People didn't like the 3D thing, and people didn't like the whole Neo thing.
3410371	3411291	VII was a great game.
3411491	3414732	VII was a great game, it was, but people hate on it because it wasn't more of VI.
3415012	3429433	and it was 7 was rushed by Sony so it wasn't really even done but yeah I really wish that 5 and 6 got the DS 3D treatment that 3 and 4 did because those remakes were so good but I guess on the 3DS the same thing could happen
3430023	3431923	Oh yeah, oh yeah, absolutely.
3432363	3441365	Going to our chatroom at chat.orangelunchradio.com, lots of people perking up at the idea of F-Zero on the new Nintendo console being possible launch title.
3441645	3444466	BlackWolf says, F-Zero, yes, I agree with F-Zero.
3444526	3446206	Me likey F-Zero, me likey F-Zero.
3446726	3449807	Oh no, I'm sorry, me likey F-Zero was from Flaming Toilet in our chatroom.
3450447	3455248	BlackWolf continued up saying, F-Zero GX equals most beautiful GameCube game.
3455388	3455988	Absolutely.
3456488	3480815	I will tell you you could put that game in the Wii and you would not even be able to tell it's a game from last gen F-Zero GX is so good it's like my favorite racing game I think almost ever um let's see uh Kaijudo not much of a fan of F-Zero people love that F-Zero I never liked it it was too fast for me my friend tried to top trade it off to me and I hate it
3481055	3481475	Thanks for watching!
3507221	3512605	Ranma in our chatroom says, people hate On7 because it's the most popular, whored out, and overplayed in the fandoms.
3513125	3514586	Yeah.
3515747	3516467	That's part of it too.
3517068	3518569	Alright, moving on with some more gaming news.
3520256	3521577	Salacious Pop, what do you got for us?
3522557	3549393	Microsoft has registered a patent for networked and personalized Kinect profiles so that people can get the Kinect to remember their own unique mannerisms and how to interact with the device and also that profile would follow you if you ever went to a different Xbox and imported your it would be attached to your gamer tag is what I'm trying to say
3549993	3560639	and you can also use it to communicate possibly to other XBLA users that may not speak English or be able to communicate verbally so they might get some
3562793	3564595	I don't know, like sign language stuff in there.
3565116	3566958	Like a universal sign language type of thing?
3566978	3568400	That's kind of weird.
3568580	3578132	When I was trying to use the Kinect, you know, you lift your hand up and you move it over the tile that you want and you have to hold it there and you wait for the ring to spin around the hand icon.
3578633	3580676	I wanted to, like, punch it.
3581176	3585438	I would move my hand to the tile I wanted and I would go like this and then you were like, no, just hold your hand still.
3586299	3594602	And I think if I could go and say, I don't like how the Kinect wants me to do this particular command.
3594682	3598264	Here's how I want to do it and have it save that and follow my profile around.
3598304	3600305	I think that's what this patent is for.
3601045	3601746	That'd be really cool.
3601926	3602286	Interesting.
3602586	3605407	But then they throw in this whole, like, phones and computers into it.
3605467	3607408	And I'm like, what, the phones are going to have Kinect in them?
3607628	3608509	I hardly think so.
3609029	3611090	Maybe the profile comes in somehow.
3611330	3616713	I mean, I guess Kinect isn't just about the motions, but voice as well.
3617173	3620294	So maybe the voice will activate your profile on the phone?
3621035	3622075	Seems a little strange.
3622235	3622395	Yeah.
3625009	3626690	Anyhow, well, I guess we'll see what comes of that.
3626730	3629711	That could be something that Microsoft's planning on unveiling at E3.
3629771	3630111	We'll see.
3631052	3638355	Something else we might find out more on very soon is what is to come of this online survey that EA is doing.
3638475	3643938	As you know, surveys are a popular breeding ground for rumors, and this time it's about EA Sports.
3644258	3656162	Apparently EA Sports is investigating the reception to a paid subscription that would deliver paid downloadable content for free and make some full versions of upcoming games available to download before the release date.
3656562	3661763	So it's like you could join the club and then you get to break the embargo on games or something.
3662203	3665724	Kind of sounds a little bit like PlayStation Plus, but unique to EA or something.
3665764	3666065	I don't know.
3667725	3686574	Some of the bullet points that were mentioned in the survey Discounts on all downloadable content for participating EA Sports console based titles Let's see, yeah, so that's the kind of stuff they're talking about asking Also, of course, you can get the game on PlayStation Network or Xbox Live before it even comes out
3687314	3708726	that could be indicative of digital distribution and kind of moving more towards that mechanism so you would be able to bypass the store and buy the game from EA directly so they could keep all the profits that apparently is the intent here but you have to pay to join the club to do that you get to pay to join this club so you can pay EA directly and get the game early
3711181	3712843	That's what I'm reading out of this, right?
3712863	3713905	Bribe us and you'll get it.
3714546	3715527	It's kind of what it is.
3717771	3718151	We'll see.
3718572	3725923	Also, one other thing that they're talking about, the ability to transfer paid content from your current participating titles to future title versions.
3726824	3742821	so like if you buy like $50 worth of extra golf courses in Tiger Woods 12 you would get to transport them to future games which a lot of other game series are already doing for free like DJ Hero did that right you had the downloadable thing that would unlock anyway
3745223	3748086	Launch Day DLC, the ability to turn left, five bucks.
3748446	3751149	Launch Day DLC, the ability to turn right, five bucks.
3752190	3753351	That's where I'm worried we're headed.
3753371	3755273	But it's a racing game, so you only need to go forward.
3755693	3757394	You don't have to get left and right if you don't want to.
3757535	3762439	That's the one thing that excites me about what's going on with Sony right now, which I know sounds really messed up.
3762459	3770947	But if it does come out that your personal data was put at risk, digital distribution just got set back four years, guaranteed, if that comes out.
3772399	3773121	On the console level, yes.
3773161	3773401	Yeah.
3783047	3783447	I don't know.
3783948	3784388	Steam?
3784608	3790851	Steam is really just a store where PSN and XBLA is more of an integrated matching process.
3790871	3793673	There's still stores, but they're stores that are built into your console.
3793713	3794854	It's a little different.
3794874	3797915	Whereas the PC isn't so much a console.
3798256	3800337	You have the freedom to do whatever you want on the PC.
3800357	3802418	There are alternatives to Steam for the PC.
3802478	3806901	It's the same platform.
3806961	3810623	We will see what comes of this possible paid subscription in the future.
3810783	3811123	Moving on.
3811687	3814649	Well, since we were on Steam and this is how I bought the game.
3816410	3822555	Super Meat Boy Ultra Edition will be coming out in the UK sometime between July and September this year.
3823496	3834424	It will be published by Lace Mamba Global and it's going to be an actual boxed edition that is going to be coming out.
3834564	3838687	So it will have a 40 page booklet that has never before seen art.
3839287	3847892	and some behind the scenes information, an extended version of Team Meat Comics and the soundtrack and additional audio and a mini poster.
3849053	3850033	Yay, a poster!
3851614	3855596	And then you also get a slab of rotted meat and a band-aid.
3856137	3856937	And you get a meat dress.
3857337	3858058	You get a meat dress.
3858838	3859439	Okay, maybe not.
3859719	3859979	Oh, no.
3861879	3863319	Do they have that as a marketing thing?
3863379	3864520	Little bandages?
3864740	3865620	Super Meat Boy band-aids?
3865640	3868381	See, that would be a good idea to have bandage girl bandages.
3868421	3869041	There you go.
3869301	3869841	Absolutely.
3870161	3872702	Copyright, Jamie, Orange Island Radio.
3872762	3873902	Oh, wait, except it's not your game.
3873942	3874642	Pay, pay, pay.
3874762	3875103	All right.
3876743	3881804	Anyhow, let's move on and travel the world with some release dates and see what games are coming out to a store near you.
3881924	3884625	It's going to be hard to top last week, but we'll see what happens.
3884925	3888466	Salacious Pop, why don't you start us off with what is coming out this week in America?
3889515	3898363	Since we didn't have a show last week, there are a few other titles aside from MK and Portal that came out.
3898763	3902407	Socom 4 was another big one for last week.
3902447	3903808	Nobody gets to play it right now.
3903868	3905069	Yeah, totally.
3905429	3908792	And then Final Fantasy 4, the complete collection on PSP.
3909513	3910494	Huge week for games.
3910814	3911194	Huge.
3912135	3913836	This week, upcoming is...
3915785	3923327	Pretty sparse, considering people's wallets can't really take more gonzo weeks of game releases like last week.
3923367	3924427	So this one's pretty mellow.
3925327	3940690	We have Operation Flashpoint, Red River on PS3 and 360, Haunted for PC, Operation Flashpoint, okay, Red River again on PC, Darkspore on PC, and...
3944301	3952688	IL2, I cannot even pronounce this, Sturmavik, Cliffs of Dover on PC, which sounds like a weird budget army game.
3952808	3953609	I don't even know what that is.
3954009	3954329	But that's it.
3954349	3955150	It's like six titles.
3955891	3962656	Bobby Blackwolf in our chat room is lamenting the non-mention of Conduit 2, which also came out this last week.
3964278	3964718	Oh, there it is.
3964758	3964978	Yeah.
3965058	3967661	And poor little Conduit 2 is going to get that a lot.
3969542	3971823	This was not a smart week to release that game.
3971863	3972403	Sorry, dudes.
3972703	3973663	I don't know what else to say.
3975204	3979745	I think some companies severely underestimated the power of Portal Combat.
3979805	3982646	I mean, on top of SOCOM, too.
3982686	3984086	SOCOM is a huge game, too.
3984446	3987287	I actually think it was a dumb week to release Final Fantasy IV, too.
3987647	3992808	Especially considering that the PSP does a lot through digital distribution now.
3992868	3996389	Well, nobody can buy that game on the PlayStation Network right now.
3997990	3998310	Yikes.
3999076	3999756	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4023951	4025651	I don't know, now I can't even remember the name of it.
4025691	4027492	But yeah, it has this really unique art style.
4027512	4029032	It reminds me of an old PC game.
4029732	4030632	Is it Alone in the Dark?
4030672	4031353	Is that what it's called?
4031673	4032293	I can't remember that.
4032353	4032713	Let me see.
4032953	4034993	It was a classic game of the week she did not that long ago.
4035494	4037934	But I don't know why, but the art style kind of reminds me of that a little bit.
4038294	4039474	Yeah, it's kind of an action game.
4040335	4043355	Maybe in the same vein as like Bayonetta type of thing where you play a dude with a sword.
4043395	4044035	That is really pretty.
4044055	4045236	Yeah, it is a pretty game.
4045256	4047836	Again, that's El Shaddai Ascension of the Metatron.
4048136	4049457	Comes out this week on the Xbox 360.
4050237	4051177	Very biblically themed.
4051557	4057000	Also this week on the Xbox 360 in Japan, Espegaluda 2 Black Label Platinum Collection.
4057200	4058340	I love Espegaluda.
4058620	4059561	Price reduction.
4059761	4060801	That's bullet hell, right?
4061462	4061722	Or no?
4061822	4062882	Oh, yeah.
4062942	4065624	PlayStation 3 also gets El Shaddai this week.
4065744	4068665	That's pretty much the only big release over there on the PlayStation 3.
4069485	4071646	On the Nintendo Wii this week, nothing.
4071826	4074828	You're going to hear that a lot when it comes to the Nintendo Wii because there's nothing coming out.
4075328	4079351	On the Nintendo 3DS, Dekasporta 3D Sports comes out.
4079471	4082613	That, of course, is Dekasports from Hudson in Japan.
4083654	4092320	Coming out on the regular DS, Hakoyuki Yugi Roku DS comes out this week on the Nintendo DS non-3D.
4092800	4097884	That's an adventure game with little chibi characters that I'm sure most people don't care about because...
4098544	4099525	It's so last gen.
4100146	4106552	And then lastly, the Sony PSP has a variety of games coming out this week in Japan, including Patapon 3, which I believe came out over here as well.
4107113	4111498	Saigo no Yakusoku no Monogatari comes out as well this week.
4111638	4117844	That is from Epic, and that is a Japanese RPG on the PSP.
4119065	4121448	Looks like kind of a man versus robot type of thing.
4122809	4148861	and lastly Otome wa Onesama no I'm sorry Ni Koi Shiteru Portable 2 Jin no Elder comes out this week as well and that is one more adventure game on the PSP in Japan and this is the one that future features pretty girls and it looks like you play four pretty girls going on these quests they're like looking through telescopes and dressing up it's like the Spice Girls get their own RPG look at that
4150742	4153264	We have a few things for Europe.
4155025	4170615	On the 26th is Mythos, on the 27th there's Outland, on the 28th Darkspore, Shin Megami Tensei Persona 3 Portable, also on the 29th is Thor the video game, and Virtua Tennis 4.
4173156	4181925	yay Virtua Tennis let's move on with another story from Salacious Pot the classic game of the week is coming up in just a little bit stay tuned
4183288	4192012	Okay, so as of the 16th, which would have been, I guess, last weekend, the Wii console has experienced a price drop.
4192312	4196434	Best Buy got to do it first for about a day before everyone else.
4197114	4197434	Now, $170.
4198535	4205838	And then every other major retailer started selling it at that price, I think, within 48 hours later.
4207118	4209920	So yeah, as of the 18th, you can get a Wii kit for $170.
4210340	4217944	And also, just more recently announced, Wii Sports Resort and Wii Party, which are the two...
4220262	4222724	I guess they're bundled titles that you can also buy separately.
4223124	4227967	Also got more of the staple titles of the current Wii lineup.
4228147	4230188	If you just can't get enough, Woohoo Island.
4230628	4231949	Yeah.
4232029	4237753	Those prices dropped $10 down to $39.99 per title starting the 25th, which is tomorrow.
4242936	4249381	So Wii Console cheaper, and the two staple games, if you didn't get them bundled, are now $10 off as well.
4250081	4264632	Now, I just want to point this out, because this is something you're not really reading in the news, but, you know, Loki has ties when it comes to selling things, and he made this little note in our little thread where we always talk about what stories we're going to talk about on the show, and so I'm going to pass this little tidbit along, do with it what you will.
4265112	4269075	He says, just the top five direct Nintendo retailers...
4269496	4270881	Not all retailers.
4271402	4275155	This is a temporary price drop to clear overstock inventory.
4276657	4303327	I wonder why they'd want to move Wii's well I mean one could hypothesize that the new Nintendo console plays into this but come on that's going to be a year away although I don't know I mean part of me wants to say why would you announce a console at E3 when it's not going to come out until next year but that's exactly what they did with the 3DS so that kind of refutes that but I would think they would try to get it something out console wise this year but we'll see I don't know
4304248	4306090	I don't know what this price drop should be tried into.
4306130	4307091	Maybe a new bundle.
4307171	4308993	Maybe that's the route they're going to go.
4309353	4313478	Maybe they're clearing overstock so they can do some Uber Wii bundle that's going to come out for the holidays.
4313958	4319244	In these two games, like I just said, if you buy them all a cart, you can also get a bundle with them.
4319744	4320345	Ah, true.
4320785	4322968	So they're just kind of taking up space now.
4323488	4327193	There's got to be some type of Uber Wii coming out towards the end of the year.
4327574	4329236	Is it called the Wii Wii?
4331319	4333802	None.
4335023	4338428	Something you will not be able to play on the Wii, but you'll be able to play it on the Xbox 360.
4339569	4348736	and eventually you'll be able to play it on the PlayStation 3 but news came out this week that Child of Eden from Q Entertainment has been pushed back to September on the PlayStation 3.
4349437	4353880	The game is still coming out on June 14th for the Xbox 360 with Kinect support.
4354321	4356082	So why was it pushed back to September?
4356542	4356802	Well...
4357603	4362587	They haven't really said, but they have said that it will now feature Move support for the PlayStation.
4362947	4367591	So perhaps that is the reason why it was pushed back, was to include the PlayStation Move support.
4368532	4369813	I don't know why they bothered.
4370113	4377198	They should have just patched that in later, because I kind of think the PlayStation Move... Is anyone still all about PlayStation Move right now?
4377659	4380121	I mean, one could argue, is anyone about Kinect right now?
4380441	4381301	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4411704	4414247	and visit Classic Games from Gaming's Past.
4414568	4421315	It's the Classic Game of the Week segment and DarkSakura's going to dive into the vault headfirst and find a game that she says, Hey!
4422417	4423278	You little brats!
4423878	4426982	This is a classic game you should check out right freaking now.
4427423	4428944	DarkSakura, what is the Classic Game of the Week?
4429873	4432255	The game of the week is called Narbacular Drop.
4433556	4435178	And this is a game I have brought up before.
4435378	4436439	I see what you're doing here.
4436739	4437220	Exactly.
4437260	4440202	I figured with Portal 2 coming out, it's best to get to the root.
4440703	4445487	All right, let's listen to some of the ambience from Narbacular Drop.
4446088	4446288	Yeah.
4448770	4452273	Hopefully the... There wasn't a lot of sound in this game, I believe.
4452313	4454175	No, but it had some decent music.
4457079	4462643	Well, at any rate, Narbacular Drop is the precursor to Portal.
4463243	4473030	It was a free game online in 2005 for the PC, ran in DirectX 9, and it was the senior game project of students going to DigiPen.
4473950	4481456	They actually named it Narbacular Drop because Narbacular is not really a word, and so it would help the thing be found on search engines really easily.
4482476	4494167	So basically, the whole premise is that there was a Princess No Knees, as in No-K-N-E-E-S, who is unable to jump.
4494247	4505317	She was captured by a demon and imprisoned, so she found out that since the prison is actually a sentient creature named Wall-E and has a portal-making ability, she could escape through using portals.
4506278	4513780	So it basically, it has the whole first person shooter vibe like Quake, but it has the portals in there too.
4513820	4514980	You have to solve different puzzles.
4515040	4518161	It's very, I mean, you can definitely see where this led to portal.
4519081	4521882	And so you create the different interconnected portals.
4521902	4526363	You can actually shoot portals through portals as well, which was very interesting.
4527323	4528023	It really helped.
4528063	4531925	But you'd have boxes and boulders and things to avoid.
4531965	4533366	You have different switches to do.
4533826	4536387	You can't save in the game.
4537267	4539828	And it really is very complex.
4540288	4545591	You only have about six puzzles in that because, again, this was a senior project.
4546531	4548833	But it's super good.
4548853	4550294	It's actually pretty, pretty fun.
4551034	4561742	And so, basically, the group that developed it was snatched right up by Valve and said, we like this idea, make us Portal.
4562363	4566486	And they're like, okay, sure, we'd like to do that.
4567506	4567666	And...
4569628	4570128	So they did.
4571529	4576132	And, uh, it's actually, you know, you can actually go get this for free.
4576852	4577753	It is online.
4578373	4580655	It will run on just about any PC.
4580855	4583177	And it, you know, it's nothing great to look at.
4583257	4584617	It looks like, you know...
4585958	4590161	and Spritely like Quake, like early Quake and Doom and Hexen.
4590721	4594584	Well, I mean, it is 3D, but it's 3D with sprite textures.
4594684	4597286	And I think something that's important to mention too, it looks nothing like Portal.
4597506	4598326	No, it looks nothing like Portal.
4598346	4599727	It does not have that test chamber look.
4599747	4601869	It looks more like a medieval castle type of look.
4601889	4606072	And I think that's one very common misconception about Immaculate Drop is that it looks like Portal.
4606112	4606632	It really doesn't.
4607009	4613011	No, it's set, you're a princess escaping from a dungeon, trapped by a demon, so.
4614852	4617753	The story is different, however, the premise is the same.
4617813	4626996	You have to use your portals, solve puzzles, and get out while not being, you know, jumped on by creatures, and falling in the lava, and having GLaDOS, wait, wrong game.
4630630	4631772	I've gotten our bacular drop.
4631812	4633315	I've gone a few puzzles through it.
4633676	4639047	And honestly, it's a little bit harder for me to get through because early 3D like that kinda...
4640635	4643637	It gives me a headache, if that makes sense.
4643717	4651302	I can do all the sprite-based 3D-like games just fine, but if it's actual 3D with the sprite-based textures, then it makes me kind of sick.
4652203	4654904	But it's still a fun little game.
4654944	4656225	I mean, it's free.
4656325	4656846	Why not?
4657866	4664390	And I've got it attached to... Well, I mean, you can't download it through Steam, but I have it attached to my Steam account, so I can just launch it through that.
4664470	4667392	But it's a fun little game.
4667472	4668093	It really is.
4668253	4668653	It's just...
4670514	4671795	It's a small download.
4672375	4675076	It's really simple.
4675136	4675996	It's just simple and fun.
4676116	4676456	That's all.
4676576	4680658	And so if you want to see the origins of Portal, you should definitely try Nebacular Drop.
4680678	4682079	All right.
4682099	4686160	With the little horribly drawn story bits at the beginning.
4686380	4691122	It's really neat to see, too, how freaking far this game evolved, too.
4692142	4694963	You go play Nebacular Drop, it's really nothing like Portal.
4695003	4696204	This is six years ago.
4696664	4697584	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4713750	4721937	So, I want to say that the original way that this was done was by completely duplicating and re-rendering the room when you threw the portal.
4722637	4733806	But now, with Portal 2, it's just, not with Portal 2, but with the actual portal, they redid those physics to where it actually would just respawn you through a particular point.
4734167	4734287	Mm-hmm.
4735227	4753752	I remember there's something about this on the Portal commentary where they were talking about the difference in programming and what went into, you know, what they changed from Robacular Drop to Portal and how certain things wouldn't carry over and how certain things had to carry over.
4754032	4755072	So it's pretty neat.
4756513	4775404	And Valve is one of the few major studios that are known to do it quite often to hire employees from the community, whether it be the fandom community or to just go to the studio that made Narbacular Drop and just say, we want to buy your shop and bring you in for this project.
4775424	4775564	Yeah.
4776448	4777629	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4796107	4796828	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4820726	4822167	of such a landmark game.
4822567	4828710	I would seriously like at least five of our listeners to download it and send me an email what you think of it.
4829010	4830551	It is super free, right?
4830611	4831051	Super free.
4831231	4831711	Very free.
4831811	4833852	You can download it all over the place.
4834233	4834553	All right.
4835573	4835973	There it is.
4836013	4841756	And that's usually your classic games of the week are like obscure fucking Sega titles that will cost you $100 on eBay.
4841776	4843157	But this one is free.
4843297	4843657	It's free.
4843737	4844157	There you go.
4844538	4845898	It's in Space Fantasy Zone.
4846498	4847459	You can download that online.
4847884	4849786	Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week.
4849806	4851568	We're going to take a break here live, folks.
4851588	4852989	We've got plenty more show to come.
4853069	4854651	It's been a pretty busy week.
4854691	4855912	We've got to talk about Mega Man Legends 3.
4855972	4857334	There was some news on that this week.
4858155	4859756	Talk about, yet again, Guitar Hero.
4860016	4863600	Rob, before I forget, I am posting the download link in the chat room.
4863780	4869446	Alright, so go download it ASAP and let DarkSakura know your thoughts, especially if you haven't played before.
4870447	4871688	Alright, we're going to take a quick break, guys.
4871708	4872389	We'll be back, though.
4872449	4873851	Plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4873891	4875032	Lots of emails tonight, too.
4875132	4877314	Speaking of wanting emails, I was looking at the email bag earlier.
4877695	4879156	It has built up over the past couple weeks.
4879216	4879857	Yay!
4879877	4881038	So we get lots of voices tonight.
4881559	4883521	And phone calls coming up before the night is over.
4883601	4888746	So stay tuned, guys, on this Easter Sunday, episode 410 of Orange Lounge Radio.
4889026	4890268	We'll be right back after this.
4896482	4897263	DarkSakra, what do you do?
4897303	4898263	You have another little show.
4925202	4925822	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4954460	4954800	All right.
4955661	4957042	But not always on.
4959164	4960545	It's been a hectic month, you know.
4960665	4962867	And besides that, now next month, finals.
4963607	4963927	Yikes.
4965228	4972774	Well, we're still doing the side project I've got going on with Extifer, the best little horde house in Azeroth, also known as Horde House for short.
4973115	4981181	If you like World of Warcraft, or even if you hate it, but you just enjoy Extifer talking about his wang, you can download us at hordehouse.com.
4981221	4982402	We actually have a website and everything.
4982902	5006440	and uh yeah we were off last week inadvertently we had Comcast go down 30 minutes into the show uh so we had like a jumbo episode this week so there's like two hours of wow talk this week that's a lot of wow it's definitely a lot of wow all right let's get into some rapid fire news some quick news stories uh that we wanted to bring up at some point on tonight's show Loki's gonna start us off oh wait he's not here slash Bob's gonna start us off
5007697	5008118	Wow.
5008238	5012062	Well, when you sit in the chair and... Yeah.
5012082	5013924	Pop's going to start us off because Loki has the night off.
5014966	5019771	Okay, so here's a feel-good human interest story that's going to make you go, aww.
5019811	5020252	Skip it.
5022507	5043145	A gamer who goes by the name of Ben, I don't know if that's his handle or his real name, started dating a nice young lady and eventually at some point during the relationship when they were hitting it off, he gave her the gamer talk, you know, if we don't have plans, I'm going to be parked in front of the TV for hours playing my games and you need to be okay with that.
5043766	5047109	And her response was, you play Borderlands, right?
5047169	5047669	Fire it up.
5047990	5048870	So, yeah.
5048890	5048971	Yeah.
5049691	5078614	so the two of them played all through Borderlands and all of the DLC and I guess Ben went to Gearbox and told them this lovely story of gamer romance and said that he was going to propose to her and Gearbox made a video called Borderlands Modest Proposal which you can find on YouTube where they have their sassy rude profanity dropping mascot
5079515	5086217	Clap Trap, he does a wedding proposal, marriage proposal video for this fan.
5086817	5088097	It took him about a week to make it.
5088597	5097279	It addresses her by name, so the band was like, hey, I want you to look at... So Borderlands, you know, helped them get to know each other.
5097299	5100040	And then they got divorced in three months.
5100060	5101420	No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
5101620	5102200	Nothing but the best.
5102220	5104221	See, it's called Borderlands Modest Proposal.
5104281	5107222	The YouTube channel is Taco Bell Manager.
5107822	5108342	Laughter
5110791	5137465	yeah sorry this is really funny Gearbox helped these this loving I hope you like Borderlands and I hope you like Gorditas because you're gonna get a lot of that and I haven't had a chance to watch about a minute and a half and I guess they got their writers to put in some jokes and yeah so took him a week to do that yeah Lord game companies work slow all right I'm just kidding I'm kidding
5138917	5141219	They got paid in 39 cent tacos.
5142399	5146622	Next we have a story about YouTube video sensation Freddie Wong.
5147602	5151364	I looked through his channel and I don't recognize a lot of his stuff.
5151965	5153505	He put out a character.
5153966	5159389	I guess he's a computer animator and he does a lot of YouTube mini-movies.
5160229	5181425	and he put out a character called Mr. Toots Mr. Toots is a tiny knee-high unicorn and this here it's half live action half CGI and Freddie Wong finds Mr. Toots in a cardboard box out on the street and Mr. Toots is a little knee-high unicorn that shoots rainbows out of its ass
5182806	5189608	So those of you that are into robot unicorn attack or just rainbow unicorn fandom hilariousness.
5190208	5192429	Oh, I love rainbow unicorns.
5192789	5194530	This is that guy that did that Portal video.
5195290	5195750	Oh, is it?
5196010	5197050	The Portal gun delivery.
5197070	5197691	All right, let me see.
5198031	5199631	I'm looking at the video here in studio.
5199831	5203072	So here's the, he lifts up the box and there's the little.
5203232	5203512	Wait, hold on.
5203532	5204093	I'm watching it here.
5204133	5205533	I'm like two seconds behind you.
5205553	5207334	That is a creepy looking unicorn.
5207534	5208374	Oh, there's the unicorn.
5208394	5209194	Oh, look at you.
5209334	5210895	You little horse thing.
5211535	5212055	What's your name?
5213191	5218394	Everything okay, huh?
5218414	5220515	Hey, looks like we got a car coming, so let's get out of the road, huh?
5222536	5227479	Shit, is that a rainbow?
5227739	5228400	No, dude, look out!
5230034	5233095	My favorite is the dude exploding and like the Mortal Kombat blood all over it.
5233155	5234615	And the skeleton.
5235076	5248740	So this is gaming related because it turns out that Mr. Toots has been copyrighted and registered to Volition Inc., the developer behind THQ's Red Faction and Saints Row series.
5249760	5262509	So whether the character came first and the THQ snatched it up or he was commissioned for this little dude, we're like, what on earth is Volition going to do with this character?
5262549	5264651	This guy actually borrowed the model.
5265611	5266552	Oh, okay.
5266612	5267912	He credits him in the end of the video.
5268112	5269573	He borrowed the model from somebody.
5269673	5271634	So it could be like some cross promotion.
5271754	5275175	And see, I love this joke in our chat room from Randy because somebody had to make this joke.
5275215	5276416	Chat.orange.com.
5276776	5278717	Mr. Toots and the pink anus.
5279377	5282719	Remember the magical unicorn game on Steam with the pink anus?
5283559	5285560	A-E-N-U-S that you buy as a material.
5285680	5285900	Yeah.
5286520	5287881	Lots of anus going on in this game.
5288874	5295720	Oh yeah, so it does look like that Mr. Toots came from THQ first and then this Freddie Wong guy did the promotional thing for it.
5296280	5297581	You know what's funny about the anus?
5297741	5298462	What?
5298502	5299823	Everything's funny about anus.
5300303	5303986	I always get it confused with this candy in Japan called ASSE.
5304166	5305988	I guess it's assay or ass.
5306748	5308710	But it looks like ass when you eat it in the box.
5309150	5310612	Mmm, tastes like ass!
5310912	5311012	Mmm!
5313658	5321323	So yeah, the biggest part of this story is just the whole what factor and the fact that it's from Volition, so where are they going to drop this dude?
5321403	5323544	Maybe he'll be a playable character in Saints Row 3.
5323785	5330369	You know, you're running... You're on drug missions, and instead of getting an Uzi, you're just shooting rainbows out of your ass at people.
5331069	5331470	I don't know.
5332250	5332430	Ass.
5334091	5336073	Thank you, DarkSakura, for derailing the show with ass.
5337543	5352551	My last quickfire story is even though Activision has pulled the plug on the XYZ Hero franchises, be it guitar or DJ, it looks like DJ Hero 2 is getting at least one more DLC pack.
5352611	5354812	Not sure if it's the last, but it's still getting content.
5355673	5357754	It's an Ultra Mix pack by...
5360115	5360776	I'm blanking.
5361036	5361737	Let me just add it up here.
5363058	5363518	Deadmau5.
5363698	5363999	Sorry.
5364059	5369203	Deadmau5 is putting out a three-song track pack for DJ Hero 2.
5369884	5378591	House Music by Benny Benassi, Sophie Needs a Ladder by Deadmau5, and We Speak No Americano by Yolanda B. Cool and DCUP.
5379952	5380593	C-U-P.
5380613	5380693	Yeah.
5382848	5383688	Womp womp.
5384129	5384749	You're gross.
5385289	5385589	All right.
5386509	5386990	Anything else?
5387770	5388270	That's it for me.
5388450	5388750	All right.
5388830	5392532	Let's go to the other music game that comes up once in a while on this program.
5392552	5393792	It used to come up a lot on this program.
5394132	5399594	Beatmania 2DX is having its 19th version being tested.
5400095	5401295	It's called Linkle.
5402415	5403736	Not sure what that's supposed to mean.
5403896	5405597	It's L-I-N-C-L-E, Linkle.
5406277	5408538	It kind of looks like Uncle, but with the U kind of.
5408558	5409738	I think that would be a better name.
5410098	5411039	Beatmania 2DX 19, Uncle.
5412339	5413961	Uncle, make it stop.
5414021	5415622	These songs don't sound the same.
5415682	5416383	What was 17 and 18?
5416463	5418124	It was like Duchess, Empress.
5418244	5419145	One was Empress.
5419225	5419565	You got it.
5419646	5420326	Empress was one.
5420366	5421667	And then the other one was Sirius.
5422148	5423289	But not like the radio.
5423369	5424990	It's the constellation in the sky.
5425010	5425991	Yeah.
5426291	5427292	So this one is Linkle.
5427973	5428854	And I don't know.
5428874	5430935	It kind of has like a sci-fi theme going on.
5430975	5431296	Whatever.
5431836	5434679	Some of the new games, or some of the new songs that are coming out in it.
5434779	5436902	I don't even recognize these bands anymore.
5436962	5438504	Like, I used to be so into this series.
5438944	5441847	Soda Fujimori, I remember him, with a song called Lucky Days.
5442788	5444851	Let's see, Coors K, Drive Me Crazy.
5445972	5446452	I remember...
5448094	5449055	Thank you for watching!
5462946	5468331	So we get a song called F. Some of the other things that are coming to 2DX 19th style as I will forever call it.
5468971	5471033	A light blue theme apparently in the game.
5472694	5475617	Song previews have been added for normal gameplay mode.
5475657	5476217	That's pretty cool.
5476237	5479940	So you can actually hear what the song sounds like finally 19 games later.
5480981	5483203	Let's see a hard EX option added.
5483603	5485164	It is even harder than hard.
5486005	5487226	That's a direct quote.
5487266	5487986	Harder than hard.
5488906	5495509	And some songs, unfortunately, have been removed from the game because, you know, they have to delete old songs to make room for the new ones.
5495849	5499851	Luckily, because I don't follow the series anymore, I don't recognize any of these songs that they've removed.
5501943	5502523	But there you go.
5502624	5504405	Beatmania 2DX, Linkle.
5504825	5509769	Now, I would care about Beatmania 2DX again if they would put out the home versions.
5509909	5511150	Especially if they came out on PlayStation 3.
5511210	5513211	Yeah, PlayStation 3, because it's not region coded.
5513651	5514332	Bring it out already!
5514372	5517174	And you have your controllers that we packed, and I want to play those.
5517194	5520396	We're already getting Tingle things in the chatroom, by the way.
5520536	5521297	Tingle and Linkle?
5522017	5522298	Nice.
5523959	5528342	You know, Tingle... If Tingle and Link had a baby, it would be Linkle.
5529640	5532906	BlackWolf in our chatroom says, 2DX lives on where Guitar Hero dies.
5533908	5537594	Well, in Japan anyway, but you don't really see anything about it here.
5538396	5541521	They should have an insane 4 controller version where you use your toes.
5542704	5546907	BVM2DX was a lot of fun, it really was Bring back the effector pedal!
5547187	5554852	Like, two arcades have it anymore You know, Arcade Infinity is gone You can go to what, Sunnyvale Golf Line or Milpitas?
5554932	5569141	One of the two still has it And they got rid of ours That's one arcade in the Bay Area They probably have the one that RVGL got rid of Maybe That's so stupid they didn't get rid of 2DX Oh, DarkSakura says they deleted Power Dream I did like that song
5570339	5570699	You know what?
5570739	5572781	We just need to have a Bimani party.
5574283	5574883	No, we don't.
5575003	5575444	Yeah, we do.
5576585	5579748	Unless you're going to kick it like it's, you know, 2002 all over again.
5579768	5580208	I know.
5580288	5586914	Well, after three songs and we're all covered in sweat because we're not in the shape that we used to be in doing nine-footer songs.
5587215	5588676	No, and that's just from playing 2DX.
5590017	5590277	Nice.
5591318	5592259	Alright, some other things.
5592739	5602867	An Xbox exclusive Mortal Kombat fighter was discussed, according to Ed Boon, saying, quote, Unfortunately, the circumstances didn't allow us to make a 360 exclusive character.
5603268	5609433	I'm not allowed to talk too much about it, but I can tell you we certainly wanted to do an exclusive for 360, but that's all I can say.
5609933	5614897	And unfortunately, that's leaving everybody to try and guess what could the character have been?
5615516	5624279	One of the, well, I can't really think of that many iconic Microsoft licensed only characters they have because Kratos obviously is a Sony only property.
5624299	5625360	He's very recognizable.
5626320	5627561	One of the Gears of War dudes.
5627901	5629221	Marcus Fenix.
5629541	5635164	Master Chief, which would be kind of dumb in that universe because at least Kratos has got the whole medieval and the blades.
5635584	5635844	Right.
5636624	5638466	How about that chick from Cameo?
5638506	5639727	What's she doing these days?
5640528	5641849	That could have been the character.
5641949	5644952	She's playing Uno with the Cameo Uno pack.
5645412	5647594	Or a nondescript dude from Fable.
5647975	5651097	I think probably what Microsoft had a problem with was the fatalities.
5651878	5667154	and it's, you know, to have your character die a horrible death is something that's hard for some people God of War already had the rendered guts and the eviscerations and the titties for no reason so Kratos is at home in Mortal Kombat Right
5668075	5689774	Microsoft doesn't really have a character like that unless chat can think of one that we're forgetting unless you know Matt I don't I don't see them splitting Master Chief in half and his little midsection it's gross some of those fatalities are gross which by the way I am gonna try and get that video of my mom playing Mortal Kombat just you know working on that I told her about the project today she's like what
5690594	5691655	So, yeah.
5691715	5693515	So, I don't know what character it could have possibly been.
5693535	5697477	I mean, if it had been Marcus Fenix or something, I think the problem would have been with the fatalities.
5697917	5699738	That's why they had to change up DC Universe.
5699798	5703640	But, I mean, it's one thing to do it for a single Xbox character.
5704000	5706641	It's another to change the game for DC Universe.
5706681	5711303	I mean, that's why they... I'm sorry, THE DC Universe, not to be confused with the game DC Universe.
5711743	5712343	You know what I mean, though.
5713304	5713424	So...
5714764	5718207	One other quick thing I want to say, it's about the 3DS Ocarina of Time.
5718227	5719928	We all know that game is coming out on the 3DS.
5719948	5722210	That's another big thing they're going to pimp for this holiday season.
5722730	5725512	There's going to be a new feature in the game called the Boss Challenge Mode.
5725832	5727113	It's an all-fighting mode.
5727394	5730256	You go up against any of the bosses you've encountered on the main quest.
5730856	5734539	You can take on the bosses individually or all at once in a continuous battle.
5734859	5735580	That's all we know.
5735780	5738622	One little unlock feature that will be in the game, an extra mode.
5739122	5745573	Kind of sounds a little silly to me, but I guess whatever extra crap they can throw in there to make it seem worth it again, they will do.
5746195	5746735	So we'll see.
5747472	5748813	DarkSakura, you got a few stories for us?
5749213	5749753	I have a few.
5750254	5755137	Konami Style, which is notable for often having pretty expensive stuff up there.
5755257	5758859	Remember the arcade style 2DX and poppin' music controllers?
5760280	5764562	Well, they have a $380 Pyramid Head sculpture now.
5765183	5766183	It's up for pre-order.
5766824	5773428	Tomopop is basically saying this is the only officially licensed Pyramid Head to date.
5774368	5779510	The actual price is 31,500 yen, or about 382 bucks.
5780271	5783032	And it's a pretty sick looking figure, I gotta say.
5783132	5793616	This is, he's all, you know, wearing his skin, you know, outfit with the big pyramid on his head and the great knife.
5793676	5796617	And it's actually specifically Silent Hill Homecoming.
5797578	5798718	So it looks pretty cool.
5798758	5800999	And I'm going to show our chat room what it looks like.
5801259	5802140	None of you will get to see.
5802200	5802980	Ha ha ha ha ha.
5805592	5806172	There you go, chat room.
5835638	5838987	That could have been the character in the game, because imagine how that fatality would have worked.
5840134	5843977	The fatality would have been you would have had to run like in Wii Fit.
5844177	5844538	I don't know.
5845018	5851683	I'm imagining Mario and Luigi in a Mortal Kombat game now where they take a monkey wrench and just shove it through someone's throat.
5852204	5854085	All these angry parents writing letters.
5854325	5855306	I love it.
5855566	5855967	I don't know.
5857248	5857768	Maybe someday.
5857988	5858469	Sorry, Jamie.
5858789	5859610	I just had to get that out there.
5859650	5860931	I love the clippy one too much.
5861291	5863353	That's a good idea for a character.
5863373	5863793	That's okay.
5863833	5865454	I'm just going, Microsoft Bob.
5865895	5866775	Awesome figure.
5866895	5867996	Awesome figure is awesome.
5869537	5874159	and in Portal 2, the little egg-shaped turrets have an Easter egg.
5874879	5880160	I have not heard this, so I'm going to have to check it out myself later, but it's on YouTube.
5880200	5881121	You guys can check it out.
5883161	5884242	Should I be bringing this up here?
5885122	5885662	If you like.
5886062	5888003	I'll go read the next story while you do that.
5888023	5889023	I got it, I got it, I got it.
5889963	5891784	It's a little, what, this is a little song they sing?
5891824	5891944	Yeah.
5891964	5892244	What is this?
5893464	5894645	It looks like around level 16.
5900856	5902237	I'm trying to see if I recognize this level.
5904958	5905858	Let me skip ahead a little bit.
5913202	5918984	The turrets serenading you is an event that happens later in the game.
5919204	5923646	I remember seeing this part in one of the levels where the turrets were unreachable.
5923666	5926688	This part looks familiar to me, but I don't remember them singing like this.
5927208	5927508	Weird.
5929749	5932572	Alright, anyway.
5933112	5939478	It would be funny if, when you're doing the defective turrets, if you could get one that sings instead of the I'm a turret!
5940398	5940779	Turret.
5941199	5946603	Yeah, all of the lethal functioning turrets are female, but the incompetent dunce turrets are male.
5947684	5950527	But there's, well, and the same goes with Wheatley.
5951728	5951888	Yeah.
5951908	5951988	Yeah.
5952628	5965536	But I've noticed that actually something that they pointed out in the first portal is that there's so much female oriented stuff in the game like bring your daughter to work day and GLaDOS being female and the main character being female.
5965636	5967357	So they're just keeping up with that theme.
5967577	5967717	Yeah.
5968077	5968738	Go power.
5969498	5973981	It's like the Silent Hill movie before they added the needless character Sean Bean.
5974770	5979016	Unrecoverable Black Screen and Elevator Save
5990310	6016821	fixed infinite loop on Mac OS X server fixed Mac OS X font rendering and glyph corruption fixed GC memory leak various location content improvements support for English subtitles and Turkish builds because people in Turkey love their portal minor string interface glitches, fixes for multiple crashes, improved detection handling for various errors and or crashes activated UI to enable joystick in game, that's pretty cool
6018242	6025310	However, it did get a 10 out of 10 from Eurogamer, so I think it's pretty sweet.
6026211	6027012	It's sick!
6028353	6028794	And that's it.
6030376	6030596	Nice.
6034440	6043409	I was going to say part of the reason that they had to give the Turkish language support was that Hakan from Street Fighter 4 threatened to kick their ass if they didn't add that.
6043649	6046572	He was going to threaten to oil himself up and send nude photos.
6046592	6049655	Yes, he was going to oil himself up and send nude pictures if that didn't happen.
6050905	6051765	Let's go to the Twitter.
6051905	6052666	Get some Twitter topics.
6052706	6054186	Actually, shit, I forgot to ask for them.
6054206	6059088	So we may not have anything on Twitter, but let's see what happens if I go to the Twitter at twitter.com slash OLR.
6059108	6061769	And let's see what happens when Rob forgets to request these things.
6062570	6063970	Let's see if we got anything anyway.
6064010	6064410	Let's see.
6064510	6065311	Logging into Twitter.
6066931	6068592	Clearly I'm prepared for this segment tonight.
6068612	6069892	Twitter.com slash OLR.
6070553	6071913	Oh, we do have some tweets.
6072093	6072433	Look at this.
6073294	6073574	Let's see.
6076497	6085268	Redertainment says on Twitter, given her biting yet funny insults, how do you think GLaDOS would deliver a Yo Mana joke?
6085308	6089173	I think he meant to say Yo Mama, but he typed Yo Mana, which is actually really funny.
6089193	6089634	I don't know why.
6089654	6090374	It would be this.
6090995	6091936	Your mother is dead.
6095845	6096426	That's very good.
6096466	6096927	I like that.
6097207	6099030	There's a joke in there.
6100792	6104237	SSJ100Matt is on Twitter saying, Hey, it's Easter.
6104818	6106300	Whatever happened to peep jousting?
6106881	6111188	Also, what's your favorite totally not kosher for Passover Easter candy?
6112372	6114033	Ooh, good question.
6114593	6115213	Waffles.
6115653	6118595	I couldn't have waffles today.
6118635	6119755	I wanted waffles so bad.
6121516	6122517	Whatever happened to peep jousting?
6122817	6125798	Actually, I was trying to explain peep jousting to my mother this morning.
6126398	6126618	Right?
6126979	6127499	Remember?
6128039	6128719	You brought it up.
6129780	6130500	Yeah, there's a very...
6133875	6141377	Like, you're either someone that doesn't mind peeps, or will eat them, or you think they're the most vile fucking candy on the face of the earth.
6141478	6142298	Vile, vile, vile, vile.
6142658	6150761	Yeah, so we brought up peeps at the Easter breakfast, and Rob's mom and I think aunt...
6152501	6154462	You say the two relatives were like, oh, peeps.
6155463	6158664	My cousin-in-law.
6159185	6162887	So they were going through their whole peeps are gross rant, and we mentioned peep jousting.
6163167	6169290	That was after my cousin's son, who's nine years old, was threatening to look up the show on the internet.
6169330	6170631	So God, I hope he didn't find it.
6171992	6173092	If so, you need to turn it off.
6174773	6176414	Your mother's going to kick your butt.
6179356	6182759	I'm surprised that there wasn't more bacon at the event.
6182879	6184560	Let's not get into that.
6186182	6187383	But yeah, peep jousting.
6187443	6187703	I don't know.
6187723	6189144	I haven't done peep jousting in a long time.
6189665	6191066	What about the other part of the question?
6191126	6194829	What's your favorite totally not kosher for Passover Easter candy?
6195209	6201471	The problem with that is that candy would be okay as long as it's not made with flour.
6201491	6204332	You know, like something with a crust.
6205732	6206032	Pocky?
6206092	6208213	Yeah, you couldn't have Pocky.
6208733	6210594	But I don't really think a Pocky would be strong.
6212546	6213247	DarkSakura.com
6228743	6229103	DarkSakura.com
6248303	6275508	now I'm imagining chocolate covered chicken and that would just be gross go to any state fair in the south well you're from the south, you know it would be chocolate covered chicken deep fried in like bacon fat ew alright we got some other I will tell you one thing my friend made bacon brownies I see that I told her that when all this is over she used to make me some turkey bacon brownies what about you?
6275608	6276328	favorite Easter candy?
6278875	6296129	The Reese's Peanut Butter Cup Eggs Just because it's just a big flat peanut butter cup And those are amazing You know what I don't like are cream eggs I can't People worship those things But they are too much They are too much They have those mini cream eggs now Those I can eat Sells Mars Eggs
6298931	6299372	Marzipan?
6299652	6300873	No, Mars Bars eggs.
6301033	6301433	Oh, okay.
6301693	6305636	And they also have these dark chocolate truffle eggs.
6306516	6312620	Because there are all kinds of cream eggs sold in England, and these are just... They're all Cadbury, the ones that they carry.
6312640	6313541	They also have the...
6315914	6318195	The Galaxy ones.
6318315	6318995	They sell those too.
6319196	6320016	And the Aero ones.
6320036	6321837	They're all puffed air chocolate eggs.
6322097	6322437	So good.
6322517	6322737	Anyway.
6323498	6324478	I need to go get my Mars egg.
6324658	6326039	Let me get to some more tweets.
6326119	6327459	Flaming Toilet is tweeting us.
6327619	6334383	Upgrading to a new Slim PlayStation 3 and tired of waiting for PSN to come back.
6334963	6339285	Is it okay to do data transfer utility or do I risk losing data?
6340649	6341110	I don't know.
6341150	6341990	I have no idea.
6342491	6345254	Data transfer between his old system and his new one?
6345334	6346155	That's what I'm assuming.
6346435	6347536	Okay.
6347556	6348977	Kind of like a license transfer, I'm assuming.
6348997	6350019	Like what you do on 360?
6350099	6351140	I've never had to do that before.
6352341	6353662	I wouldn't risk it.
6353722	6355584	Honestly, right now, not a good time to try that.
6355604	6359188	Because it... Depending on when his slim was...
6360575	6362375	are manufactured and put on the shelves.
6362456	6364856	He's probably a few OS updates behind.
6365556	6369657	And that, once he actually gets the Slim online, it's like, oh, we need to update you to 3.6.
6370758	6372018	I don't know what number they're on.
6372358	6374119	And that might invalidate his certificates.
6374359	6375759	So just wait.
6376039	6376419	Good point.
6376439	6377620	Yeah, you're going to have to wait it out.
6377720	6378000	Sorry.
6379640	6380300	And let's see.
6380440	6383561	One more tweet from TigerClaw305 on Twitter says this tweet.
6383961	6386642	The DS Lite is going to be discontinued.
6387442	6397870	Yeah, that was some news that was circulating this week, is that the DS Lite is no more, and he's linking us to a story on 1up.com that apparently references a NeoGAF post where there is documents going out.
6398631	6406276	Nintendo is not offering any comment on this right now, but I guess some of the older DSes are being discontinued, which makes sense, I mean.
6406356	6410319	Well, I think every person in the developed world
6411681	6413364	has one, including their pets.
6413946	6415288	Like, my cat has a DS light.
6415329	6415709	I'm kidding.
6416130	6419257	But no, I think, yeah, that's... They're pretty...
6421431	6421811	Prevalent.
6422251	6426993	Yeah, and they're not getting rid of the DSi or the DS XL.
6427053	6427593	That's important to know.
6427633	6429113	And I still want one of those too, but yeah.
6429634	6430934	So there's no... Why?
6430994	6432074	Why not just get the 3DS?
6432675	6433035	I don't know.
6433435	6434215	Those screens are big.
6434815	6437456	Well, the 3DS is backwards compatible with the regular DS, right?
6437536	6437676	Yep.
6437956	6438196	Okay.
6438216	6439557	But not the advanced games.
6440037	6442138	So you like must play Game Boy Advance games still?
6442158	6444638	Well, they haven't had the GBA port on the DS in a while.
6445359	6445679	Oh, that's right.
6445699	6446819	They got rid of that with the DSi.
6446899	6447059	Yeah.
6447479	6449680	So I guess that's the one thing you're losing with the DS Lite.
6450160	6451240	No more Game Boy Advance games.
6451881	6453081	So there you go.
6454281	6454701	Let's see.
6455162	6455902	One more tweet.
6455922	6457422	TigerClaw got in one more.
6457522	6458183	And why not?
6458203	6459183	I'll go ahead and read this one.
6460183	6463124	Chrono Trigger apparently is also coming out.
6463144	6465965	So I guess this is in the same vein as the Final Fantasy VI thing we heard about earlier.
6466345	6472307	Apparently Chrono Trigger for the PlayStation 3 and PSP was outed by an ESRB listing.
6472567	6478389	So this is probably just right up the same alley as Final Fantasy VI because Chrono Trigger was released for the PlayStation 1.
6479742	6482905	and yeah, so this is, yeah, the, what was that called?
6482925	6485187	Was it the Final Fantasy Chronicles that had Chrono Trigger in it?
6485247	6485888	It was Chronicles.
6485908	6487689	Chronicles, yeah, the other one was the Anthology.
6487990	6493275	Yeah, so it's probably just obviously a port of that because that's already been out on Sony.
6493395	6502263	The DS port with the extra dungeon and the endings and stuff is probably still the better Chrono Trigger port.
6502804	6505107	release that you'd want to get rather than this one.
6505427	6508231	Give us a legit Chrono Trigger sequel already.
6508311	6511535	Like, I know there's Chrono Cross, but I mean, seriously, how long ago was that?
6512336	6512937	Damn, Square.
6514765	6543165	everybody loses their shit over that game and yet we still don't have like something in that canon it's weird one of the reasons why I still want a DS XL is because Chrono Trigger port on the DS I can see it fine it's not like I'm blind but just those sprites I want them on a bigger screen so fair enough yeah all right let's move on with some more gaming news and then we're gonna get to your phone calls before too long and emails we have lots of emails tonight can't wait to do that DarkSakura's got to work tonight
6543536	6544196	Yeah.
6544256	6544617	Yay.
6545037	6545317	All right.
6545817	6546437	Salacious Pop.
6546778	6547138	More news.
6548799	6563786	So after that, a couple weeks ago, we announced that the Mega Man project that Capcom was working on was scrapped, but they're still, from what we understand, working on Mega Man Legends 3 that has a huge fandom that really wants that game to come out.
6565466	6572590	Capcom has announced that they are putting out a Mega Man Legends 3 prototype version, which is sort of a...
6573470	6574992	Beta slash demo.
6575132	6582259	I'm not sure if it's going to have a full start to finish or it's a separate episode that may not necessarily be in the full release of the game.
6582879	6586443	But it's just what they have compiled that runs well.
6586463	6591488	They're going to put it out for the 3DS and on their eShop.
6592109	6593390	It's supposed to hit in late May.
6594731	6622975	and there's a playable character named Barret and it offers a few missions not to be confused with the first person ever to say shit in Final Fantasy just so you know so you play as Barret and it's going to have a few missions though it's probably going to be spammed with loading screen messages that just say this is not a finished product this is a game in progress any bugs blah blah blah so yeah we're going to get something but you're going to have to pay for it right let's see
6625053	6626174	Quickly, let me throw this out here.
6626394	6627314	It's going on the eShop.
6627354	6628274	Let me throw this out here, too.
6628294	6633717	A little follow-up to that is that I guess Capcom isn't really sold on this whole thing.
6634777	6640760	They are saying that we need interest, we need participation from fans, or this game could be axed at any second.
6641500	6644861	For some reason, I'm just reminded of when Tinkerbell is dying.
6645141	6645522	Clap.
6645742	6646842	If you want to save me, just clap.
6647102	6647762	Clap louder.
6648043	6649823	Clap louder and say, I believe in fairies.
6649983	6650824	I believe in fairies.
6650884	6652584	That's literally what Capcom is saying.
6652604	6653245	You need to clap.
6654125	6655666	and say, I believe in Mega Man!
6655966	6657027	I believe in Mega Man!
6657087	6657847	And then give us your money.
6658287	6659228	Is basically what they're saying.
6659588	6674297	So they have come out and said in a blog post on Capcom Unity, Masakazu Iguchi, the director of the game, said the prototype version that's coming out on the 3DS is based on the prototype that they made to prove to Capcom that the game could happen.
6674837	6680220	The heat and excitement surrounding this downloadable title would determine whether or not the full game could be greenlit.
6680660	6682802	If hype is strong, the full title will be a go."
6683442	6684803	If not, it's a no-go.
6696114	6697915	Dude, bunch of surf bots.
6699216	6705639	If you want Legends 3, if this thing costs money and it's basically a glorified beta, that's kind of lame.
6705800	6706680	But yeah, pick it up.
6707821	6710422	They're tracking heavily the response to this, so get it.
6710442	6713744	So now not only do we have pay to unlock content, but we have pay demos.
6714865	6715925	Pay to finish developing.
6718905	6747717	you want us to fix those clipping issues or you know the game crashes if you try to walk backwards you know just slip a little like a 20 we'll figure it out alright well I guess to be fair the Gran Turismo 5 prologue was kind of the same thing it kind of sounds like where this is going except we always knew there would be a Gran Turismo 5 eventually although was Bobby ever convinced that Gran Turismo 5 came out I'm not sure hopefully he's in chat and can let us know
6748297	6748718	DarkSakura.com
6765117	6765838	Thank you for watching!
6788594	6817672	uh now apparently they were kind of asked well didn't you like try to get this cleared with Sega or what's going on uh Bomberlink who's the project leader on the progress said they did contact Sega uh I would like to say this is a quote from him I would like to say that we did actually contact Sega last year through an email message regarding the use of copyrighted material to which they answered asking us to send a formal letter to their legal department so that's what we did we accepted the ESA policies regarding the DMCA as well otherwise this website would not exist anymore so
6818192	6818632	There you go.
6819653	6821333	They had to take it down because Sega didn't like it.
6822254	6823674	Eight years that thing was in the making.
6823854	6828776	And Sega is just trying to really utilize that Streets of Rage license right now.
6828936	6830057	It's a big IP for them.
6830077	6838520	A part of trademark law is you have to pursue every infraction against your brand even if you're not doing anything with it.
6838920	6841642	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6863877	6869762	So yeah, this is unfortunate to hear because the community obviously really cares about it and have to take eight years to put this out.
6870282	6873765	But the fact that they were C&D is sort of, I don't know, seems like a duh.
6875646	6878848	Do we mention about the whole Sega building in San Francisco now belongs to Zynga?
6878868	6879549	To Zynga, yeah.
6879569	6880750	We did bring that up on the show, huh?
6881090	6885033	Speaking of sad stories, sad, sad stories.
6885053	6885974	We need a sad trombone, Rob.
6886414	6889336	I didn't know Zynga owned Words With Friends now either.
6890197	6891058	Zynga's the...
6891778	6893098	I stopped playing Words with Friends.
6893138	6893538	You know why?
6893558	6896179	Because everybody wants to fucking play Words with Friends.
6896239	6898680	And then it's like my phone keeps going off every two seconds.
6899360	6901600	Your move with DarkSakura.
6901660	6903081	I don't play.
6903421	6905081	Random people you didn't know, right?
6905101	6906342	We're trying to start new games with you.
6906362	6907202	Yeah, that shit happens too.
6907622	6908642	Fuck Words with Friends.
6908922	6909742	It's a terrible game.
6910403	6911043	Yeah, I said it.
6913450	6914611	I love Scrabble That's not a word!
6930077	6935799	You can actually take a screenshot of the screen from Words With Friends and then like upload it to this other app and it just cheats.
6936060	6936700	Tells you the best word.
6936720	6949385	When I was playing a lot of Yahoo Literati, I would, there was a JavaScript website that was in Anagram Finder where you would put in your Yahoo Literati URL and it would say, oh, here's your word.
6950105	6951126	You're a cheater.
6951146	6951586	Yeah.
6952166	6953547	You are a cheater?
6954067	6956028	You cheated on Yahoo Literati?
6956128	6956368	Yes.
6956568	6957629	You're going to hell.
6958029	6958329	Awesome.
6959269	6962210	I can, however, say that I have not cheated at Scrabulous.
6964311	6965231	I miss Scrabulous.
6965311	6966211	What's Scrabulous?
6966891	6970752	Scrabulous became Lexulous because Scrabble or whatever.
6970772	6971733	Is that on Facebook?
6972153	6972513	It is now.
6972613	6973673	Ah, fuck that game too.
6974113	6978775	Well, I don't play it on Facebook, but I used to play it when it was Scrabulous and it had Scrabble Solitaire.
6979535	6983376	Now it's like, it makes you play with people and I hate that because Scrabble Solitaire is super fun.
6984256	6987357	Where basically you just play until you're out of words and build up your score.
6987799	6989704	Are there any fun Facebook games right now?
6989784	6991228	Like I know that's kind of an oxymoron.
6991328	6993634	I've been going in and deleting just about all of my apps.
6994373	6996194	There's seriously nothing I play on Facebook.
6996214	6997294	I got sick of Knights of the Clique.
6997314	7002396	I'm sure I have like four trillion blood points in Vampire Wars that I haven't touched in three years.
7002996	7005136	Knights of the Clique haven't touched in two and a half, three months.
7006077	7006637	I deleted it.
7006997	7008397	I deleted almost all of my games.
7008898	7010078	I want to play the Civ game.
7010118	7011338	That was the only thing I was interested in.
7011678	7012299	Did that come out?
7012499	7013059	I don't even remember.
7013079	7014939	It was in Alpha for a long time.
7015460	7022862	And then there's supposedly, and it's a story that didn't make our show roll tonight, but some music game is out on Facebook too that I need to check out for next week.
7023602	7043167	something that was posted in our thread about like a Facebook game but I wanted to actually play it before bringing it up on the show but apparently there's that too so all right uh Kassan in our chat room says Scrabulous sounds like a Decepticon name I like that all right let's move on uh DarkSakura what do you got for us
7044945	7050892	There is an Activision memo that was linked that says there is no appetite for Guitar Hero.
7052073	7056839	But there is an appetite for Destruction.
7058126	7061528	And there's also an aperitif for destruction, if you like.
7061948	7062868	Lounge against the machine.
7064549	7064849	Anyway.
7066090	7073953	Basically, the whole thing is that they're saying is that, yeah, right now it's dead, but it should eventually come back up.
7073993	7074313	They're asking...
7076834	7084237	The CEO, Eric Hirschberg, said, why are we walking away from Guitar Hero instead of just trying to reinvent it?
7084797	7091079	And that basically it's because there are so many high-quality games that are just saturating the market.
7091159	7093660	Isn't this what we were saying before?
7093780	7095240	Is it the market was just way too saturated?
7096061	7098281	Well, they're like, oh, duh.
7098722	7099842	That's what we were doing wrong.
7100642	7101122	So...
7103543	7123152	they're sort of setting it aside for now in fact it actually says that they are quote perhaps after a cooling period we will revisit the franchise with fresh innovation they're gonna wait for people to go remember when Guitar Hero was cool and then Activision will be right there to say hey we still own the rights to this hey there's a whole new Guitar Hero game for you to play haha
7123931	7125332	It's Retro Guitar Hero.
7126953	7129294	Meanwhile, Rock Band's like, we've been out here and we're still cool.
7129514	7129834	Hi.
7130195	7130795	We're still cool.
7131215	7131495	Hi.
7132036	7132656	We're really cool.
7134377	7136658	We've attached the clarinet attachment.
7137019	7140581	Although I do, I even feel like the Rock Band thing has really died down.
7140641	7142241	Like, it's really died down.
7143102	7143722	It's kind of sad.
7143822	7145143	We were just playing the other day.
7145483	7145804	Were you?
7146064	7146324	Yeah.
7147768	7149329	The cousins were over when we were playing.
7149929	7153750	SSJ100 Matt in our chatroom says, Notice how no one ever asked these questions when DDR died.
7154010	7154870	In Konami, that is.
7155330	7158351	Well, technically DDR is still not dead.
7158551	7160252	I mean, they are still cranking out those games.
7161012	7161772	Like, wow.
7162132	7163893	There's Xbox 360 one coming out.
7164133	7165773	The port of the PlayStation 3 one.
7166173	7167434	It's coming on the Xbox 360.
7167534	7170595	And you guys, it uses the Xbox Live Vision camera.
7170995	7171755	That's how hip.
7172415	7174076	Konami is to the modern technologies.
7174116	7175016	The little webcam.
7175056	7176237	Not the Kinect, but the little.
7176257	7177438	Not the Kinect, but the little webcam.
7177558	7178638	AOL looking thing.
7178658	7179819	And we use that, apparently.
7180259	7185382	Which I am, I hope to God for Konami's sake, the Kinect will stand in for that.
7185882	7188083	Like, you know, because the Kinect's basically a camera too, but.
7188584	7194047	Well, I think the 360 only has the one IO USB port in the back for goodies.
7194507	7197108	So you'd have to unplug your Kinect to plug in the little webcam.
7197468	7198169	That's not going to happen.
7198189	7198729	That's not going to happen.
7200106	7201748	It's next to Walt Disney's head
7221989	7222289	Alright.
7223529	7223890	Moving on.
7223930	7224550	Salacious Pop.
7225550	7233913	There was a story that we reported on a few weeks ago about ratings tampering on the indie marketplace on the XBLA.
7234253	7234413	Yes.
7234873	7245456	And some indie games that had anywhere from three to five star reviews were getting hundreds of one star reviews within a short amount of time that was throwing their
7245976	7254164	review their game listing and the rankings down in the toilet so they weren't getting as much exposure as they would otherwise if they had their four-star review.
7255065	7269178	So Microsoft decided to come up with a fix to this, and they have decided that in order to rate a indie game, you need to have a gold account, which means you are paying Microsoft money.
7269438	7271859	for the Xbox Gold Live services.
7271939	7279041	If you are a free or silver member, you cannot give a rating to an indie game.
7279221	7282982	That's good, because it was probably a bunch of sock-free accounts that were doing this anyway.
7283362	7295106	This story that I looked up also references a previous story when the manipulation was first discovered about a firm that had posted to a contractor
7297006	7304713	Job site basically saying we need someone that can write a script that will generate 5,000 free silver accounts.
7304833	7309256	They were looking for a coder that's like, can we run this overnight and just get the username spit out to us?
7309757	7318104	Doesn't necessarily say why they wanted those 5,000 accounts or if it's even related to this rating manipulation.
7318224	7322247	But just as a coincidence, there are firms out there that are like, we want...
7323288	7329053	Wow, if I was Microsoft, I would be fucking bringing the smackdown on these firms for abusing their network.
7329093	7335819	Yeah, I guess it was a graphic design firm contract script for 5,000 Xbox Live Silver accounts.
7336339	7344066	Again, don't know for sure, but the fact that the interest for that is there, Microsoft's like, if you have a free account, you don't get to rate on indie games.
7344966	7346047	Which I guess makes sense.
7346067	7353372	I mean, that sucks that you have to pay, but I mean, it will... If you're online, or if you have a gold account, they can take action against you.
7353432	7355294	They can ban your credit card.
7355314	7356355	They could ban your account.
7356695	7357816	You lose your gamer tag.
7357856	7359117	You lose your achievement points.
7359528	7363589	Why didn't they just make it so you have to actually play the game for 10 minutes to rate?
7363830	7365370	I mean, is that so hard?
7365950	7366310	I don't know.
7367151	7367971	I guess that's hard to do.
7368251	7371132	It's easy to build something to shut it off after four minutes.
7371232	7373693	Oh, demo over four minutes, clank, buy, or get out.
7373733	7378155	Can you buy indie games a la carte with a silver, or do you need gold in order to even buy stuff?
7378275	7380075	I believe you can buy them a la carte with silver.
7380396	7380616	Okay.
7380776	7380996	Yeah.
7381296	7382196	I don't see why they would shut it.
7382236	7382616	It's money.
7383096	7384397	Why would you shut off a moneymaker?
7385816	7386377	I'm pretty sure.
7388620	7391483	And Randy in our chatroom at chat.orange.radio.com agrees with me.
7391884	7395108	They should make it so that you have to actually play a game for a set amount of time to rate it.
7395388	7397391	That way people have to go out of their way to be jerks.
7397768	7426445	at the same time though what's to stop somebody from building a script that signs in 5,000 Xbox Live users into a game I mean it's possible a botting thing could do it sad but true somebody would figure it out yeah I I agree that you should be able to have to play the game before you can rate it but at the same time if I play a demo that is so bad and I want to be able to warn people that this demo was horrible
7427305	7429007	Like that Maids with Balloons?
7429087	7430088	Yeah.
7430288	7432890	I'm not going to pay the 300 space bucks.
7433631	7439596	I think people should download Maids with Balloons just to see how freaking bad it is.
7440778	7442359	You know what Maids with Balloons reminds me of?
7442739	7446082	An old CD-ROM game from when that technology first came out.
7446403	7450166	And people were like, let's put softcore porn out and try to make a game out of it.
7451648	7459627	I'm thinking of the slumber party game that that one girl was in from the Night Trap Yeah, it's like that Exactly
7461337	7461917	Alright, anyhow.
7462737	7470119	Moving on to one other story, and I've kind of brought this up before, so this is a bit of a duh, but Super Mario 3DS, of course it is going to be announced at E3.
7470359	7477240	Well, I mean, I guess it was announced, quote-unquote, at Game Developers Conference, but we're going to get the official details, I guess you could say, at E3.
7477720	7482321	Apparently, though, according to an interview with Edge, Miyamoto has leaked out a few details on this.
7482721	7488962	It's going to have a combination of Super Mario Galaxy and Super Mario 64, but it's also completely original.
7489702	7513959	so even though it's a combination of these two games it's still completely original perhaps that's because of the Tanooki or the raccoon suit which we haven't seen in any of those other games that could be part of it as well or maybe it'll just be kind of a mechanic about the story of the game or how it all kind of plays together maybe instead of I would like to see this in a Mario game maybe I'm just maybe a pipe dream but a bump but instead of all these broken up worlds what about one massive world
7514759	7515360	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7534981	7535261	Sure.
7535961	7538282	Just like any good Metroidvania type of game.
7538522	7540082	You have to get an item to get behind the door.
7540582	7541982	I would like to see that in a Mario game.
7542102	7543122	That would be pretty awesome.
7543222	7544043	Be very awesome.
7544263	7544903	We'll see what happens.
7545363	7545743	Alrighty.
7547223	7547663	Let's see.
7548203	7549123	Redertainment in our chatroom.
7549143	7550144	I want to read this comment too.
7550204	7551784	Speaking of the whole demos and downranking.
7552364	7554624	Chat.OrangeSoundsRadio.com is of course where our chatroom is.
7554704	7563306	Redertainment says, if you want to warn people that a demo sucks, I'm sure you have a Twitter account you can bitch on that reaches more people than that downloaded that indie title.
7563846	7564066	Hmm.
7565126	7568707	and Randy says that Grand Theft Mario reminds him of something that happened in Robot Chicken.
7570108	7573489	I haven't seen every episode of Robot Chicken so I guess that went over my head.
7573649	7573929	Oops.
7574549	7576630	I did see the Final Fantasy 7 fast food.
7576930	7577810	That was great.
7577890	7578750	That I did see.
7579270	7580591	Alright, let's get to the emails.
7580771	7589674	Every week you guys send us emails at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com The mailbag's been rather thin the past few weeks so I'm really happy that this week you guys have fucking blown it up.
7589994	7590454	Yay!
7591874	7593378	DarkSakura is going to work tonight.
7593860	7595825	Well, we got a request from...
7598323	7601645	Ronnie for an autograph with an address.
7601665	7608749	This is a five-year listener, so I figured I was going to find a postcard that I have, and we could just sign it and then put it in an envelope and send it.
7608769	7610049	So I have one that says Juicyful.
7610590	7611290	And it's orange.
7611530	7611990	It's orange.
7612070	7612511	It's an orange.
7612691	7620335	Either that or I was going to use a congratulations on your bar mitzvah card that I got at the dollar store for any upcoming bar mitzvah.
7620535	7620835	All right.
7620855	7622536	Because there's a lot of kids.
7623437	7625798	And I was like, no, I better save that for an actual bar mitzvah, so...
7626710	7629813	So, yeah, I set this aside, and we'll get everyone to sign it.
7629853	7631074	We gotta get Loki here, though.
7631134	7639160	I mean, Salacious Pop, I'm sure, would not, or his autograph would not go unappreciated, but I'm sure somebody wants a complete trifecta of official OLR hosts.
7639801	7640081	Yeah.
7640621	7644064	So, I just need to make sure that I mark the right one.
7644124	7645005	Yeah, don't click delete.
7645966	7647187	I'm not deleting it.
7648127	7651590	There, it's this one, so I will do unread.
7651830	7652271	There we go.
7653231	7654833	And, moving forward, um...
7656482	7663291	This is from Holly D. Hey guys, I could swear your email was the above, but I recently heard you say mailbag at originalsradio.com.
7664453	7667177	Is the Gmail one an old email or something?
7667477	7667837	I don't know.
7668058	7668979	Do we have a Gmail at all?
7668999	7669940	Do we have a Gmail?
7670040	7671242	I don't think that we do.
7671422	7673405	What's the sender's name?
7674434	7674754	Holly.
7675315	7676636	Is that the Holly that writes into Horde House?
7676836	7678377	Oh, it's probably the same Holly from Horde House.
7678977	7679878	That is a Gmail account.
7679898	7681159	Yeah, that is a Gmail account.
7681539	7686423	The email for Horde House is HordeHousePodcast at Gmail.com.
7686683	7689885	But yeah, Orange Lounge Radio is Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
7690165	7693167	I want to see if maybe somebody's swiped it.
7693187	7693488	I don't know.
7693528	7693788	Let me look.
7694740	7699722	Anywho, just wanted to confirm because I sent a couple emails and I thought it was weird that Sakura kept saying you only had one or two emails.
7700123	7701763	Maybe other people are confused like me.
7702624	7702904	Thanks.
7703764	7708647	Yeah, it's... You sent it to the right one now, so it's mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
7712592	7714394	Hey, OLR crew, ACHP here.
7714554	7723701	I don't know if anyone at OLR has played the PS2 game Shin Megami Tensei Persona 4, but I wanted to share the gaming-related project that I've decided to take upon myself.
7724141	7727744	Persona 4 takes place in the year 2011, from April 11th through the rest of the year.
7728184	7732788	That being the case, I've taken it upon myself to tweet the events of Persona 4 roughly as they happen.
7733428	7739190	It's just very deep game with lots of relationships, drama, mystery, and just lots of things to do in general.
7739230	7743031	And I'll try to make it as interesting and funny to follow along with as possible.
7743371	7746012	The Twitter account is at NarukamiYu.
7746472	7750253	That's N-A-R-U-K-M-I-Y-U.
7750793	7754334	NarukamiYu being the name of... Let me start over.
7754434	7761516	NarukamiYu being the name that the people developing the new persona for anime have given the originally nameless main character.
7762316	7769918	I'm not looking to become some sort of D-list-y celebrity by doing this, but I do want people who would be appreciated in this sort of project to know about it.
7770479	7773079	If you would spread the word on your show, I would be deeply honored.
7773219	7775460	Again, the Twitter account is at NarukamiU.
7776740	7778021	Also, happy birthday, DarkSakura.
7778141	7778581	Thank you.
7778941	7783522	Your birthday is just a few days before mine, and mine is the day before Wendell's, so yours was yesterday.
7783782	7784683	Well, happy birthday.
7785723	7789044	Keep up the great work and thanks so much for helping me spread the word AZHP.
7789144	7791505	And also a very big happy birthday to Mr. Wendell.
7791585	7792926	Thank you for reminding me to say so.
7792986	7794766	Because Wendell is one of our old school buddies.
7795687	7797087	Happy birthday, all y'all.
7797547	7799288	And glad you got that plug worked out.
7799368	7799988	Well, he's old.
7800148	7800888	He emails us a lot.
7801269	7802189	I just wanted to follow up.
7802689	7806350	It does look like there is an Orange Lounge Radio email account at Gmail.
7806550	7807231	It is not us.
7807571	7810892	So again, well, I sent a password reset thing.
7811292	7832547	so if it is one of us we'll get the email but it's not in my email it's not in my orange launch radio it's not the mailbag email so somebody else could have signed up trying to impersonate us i've certainly suppose that's possible uh loki could have it too i he might have done that for the youtube channel or something that's very possible uh so one of us will have the reset email if it's ours but as far as we know right now we don't own it so
7832927	7837009	I've got about six different emails and none of them are... And we don't write from that address.
7837189	7845793	So if you do get something from OrangeLaunchRadio at gmail.com, forward it to the official email of OrangeLaunchRadio, which is mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com so we can investigate.
7846313	7851315	Yeah, and other than that, we're probably going to have to send a notice for them to strike it.
7852075	7853016	I mean, it could be Loki.
7853156	7856137	Loki could have done with the YouTube channel, so we'll have to ask him next week.
7856577	7857338	Thanks for letting us know.
7858559	7859459	Greetings, OLR.
7859519	7861300	This week was torture without your podcast.
7861341	7862982	Don't ever take another week off again.
7863142	7868225	Even if Rob and Jamie have to go somewhere, I'll suck it up and just listen to Loki eat chicken and complain about Nintendo for three hours.
7869026	7870247	Which is exactly what it would be.
7870487	7872088	Peace and chicken grease, Serious Turtle.
7873629	7874730	He's a very serious turtle.
7875070	7876111	Like seriously, you're not allowed to leave.
7879292	7883473	I just want to point out a lot of your favorite shows take all summer off.
7884613	7887494	We take one week off every three months or so.
7887514	7889194	I think it's okay if we miss four shows a year.
7889954	7891755	Yeah, we need a vacation sometimes.
7891895	7892275	That's right.
7893435	7895156	It felt really good to not have a show last week.
7896096	7900817	I love doing the show, don't get me wrong, but it was kind of nice to have Sunday night to do something else.
7901397	7916393	well now usually when I take Sunday off if it's you know not for family stuff it's for doing something else for the show I've gone to gaming conventions and stuff called in and reported on it and sometimes honestly I wish I was here instead of there but you know
7918058	7919079	because this is my house.
7919539	7919739	Okay.
7920399	7921059	Hi, OLR.
7921099	7922399	This is from Spazinator, by the way.
7922920	7930722	I'm pretty sure that the three of you have covered the story about PSN going down this week due to hackers in Part A of this week's show, so I won't bother rehashing the details.
7930862	7933623	Rather, I'd like to do a Loki-style rant about it, if I may.
7934243	7938724	While I'm not pissed at Sony, hell, from what I can tell, they did what they needed to do.
7938904	7940165	I am, however, extremely pissed off.
7940405	7942425	Okay, dude, it's not hackers, okay?
7942626	7944046	But I will read your rant anyway.
7944867	7949769	I am, however, extremely pissed off at these fucktards that hacked PSN.
7950629	7957331	Despite Sony not explicitly saying who it was that did it, I am 100,000% sure it was these anonymous dickwads that did it.
7957892	7961413	After all, as the old saying goes, if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it must be a duck.
7961473	7962813	Who the holy hell are they to do this?
7963194	7964214	What the fuck gives them the right?
7965413	7969955	Yeah, I know I, along with a small minority, have other consoles to play online with.
7970376	7973497	Yes, there are single-player games as well, but that's besides the point.
7973937	7979300	There are games such as MAG, SOCOM, Confrontation Free Realms, DCUO, etc.
7979760	7983022	that are multiplayer only, as well as a few Capcom titles, i.e.
7983102	7988405	Final Fight Double Impact and Bionic Commando Rearm 2, that require one to be logged into PSN to play.
7988585	7990046	Hence, right now, they're unplayable.
7990686	7991487	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8008247	8020795	At any rate, when Sony finds these torps, and they will, it's just a matter of time, I hope they get the legal system on their punk asses like white on motherfucking rice, and as Samuel L. Jackson so eloquently put it, gets Medieval on their asses.
8021235	8024717	May the hackers burn in a nuclear fire, then drown in an ocean of piss and acid.
8025057	8025938	Slash end rant.
8027759	8029720	It actually did exhales, but I exhaled.
8030200	8034683	This rant is brought to you by one really pissed off PSN user that wants to lay the smackdown on some punks.
8035263	8037865	By the way, your anger may be a little misdirected.
8038185	8040406	Wait until it's resolved and official word comes out.
8041807	8043588	I kind of agree with what you're saying.
8043608	8045629	Can I read this real quick from Bobby in our chat room too?
8046029	8049111	DarkSakura, yeah, I kept telling him it wasn't anonymous and he told me I was wrong.
8049151	8050671	He told me that it didn't matter what the truth was.
8050711	8051712	He was going to blame Anon.
8053051	8073705	Anon was very proud to take credit for that first Sony attack and that's the problem is that now that this is happening I mean this could be happening from somebody who's trying to get at Anonymous for all we know Anonymous flat out said we understand this tactic only hurts the people we're trying to protect we are not going to do it anymore
8074625	8081191	But because Anonymous has no leader, you know, it's not like WikiLeaks who has that, whatever his name is.
8081211	8084974	They've got a group that's... But there's no clear leader out there.
8085034	8090399	And that's what's causing them to look bad is because it could be a subset that's doing it.
8091200	8094643	Regardless, I don't think this is Anonymous.
8095143	8097465	I think they may benefit from the notoriety.
8098686	8100407	But I don't think this is anonymous.
8101207	8105869	They flat out said, no, this is counterproductive to what we're trying to do.
8106889	8110030	So don't look for a scapegoat.
8110050	8111851	Wait until they actually officially say what's going on.
8111871	8124615	Because I have a feeling that it's actually one of those situations where, like, okay, at my work, we got an email out that said this number of people are affected because a laptop was stolen.
8125956	8132099	Who hacked the site that does all the email campaigns?
8146427	8159599	and all these websites that use this email service to maintain their mailing list and so forth had to write people because I got some from a couple companies saying your personal information may have been breached, your email and so forth because we got hacked.
8159779	8163002	Oh, are you talking about the Gawker Network, Kotaku?
8163642	8164823	No, but there's that too.
8165784	8166885	That wasn't anonymous either.
8167065	8167746	That wasn't on his email.
8168046	8173190	Somebody's out there hacking for personal information because maybe somebody in chat will ring a bell.
8173530	8174511	Somebody hacked Gawker.
8174851	8178174	Somebody hacked this email network to get all the emails and so forth.
8178635	8181617	I think it's them that's getting Sony.
8181857	8184479	I think somebody went after that private information at Sony.
8185801	8188463	So yeah, and this is what I have to say too is that
8190882	8206714	When you have a situation like this where, yeah, you may have an easy person to place blame on, keep in mind that wars have been started over people putting the blame where there was on an innocent party just because of quote circumstantial evidence.
8207915	8209176	Don't be one of those people.
8209436	8210257	Don't be a dick like that.
8211538	8220344	And also with the DDoS attack, you've got hundreds of thousands of computers that have been compromised in some way that are flooding the network with garbage.
8220384	8225867	It's very hard because you've got all of these compromised computers of just regular PC owners.
8227148	8232410	It's hard to... As obnoxious as it is, it's very difficult.
8232610	8236712	It's not an actionable crime is what I'm trying to say because the computers are compromised.
8237313	8245136	If you're hacking into something and you're getting customer information, which hasn't been confirmed yet, that's like a federal... That's serious shit.
8245176	8246156	And that's not their M.O.
8246376	8247257	Yeah, that's not what they do.
8247277	8248397	That's totally not their M.O.
8249158	8254120	Keep in mind, all of the stuff that they've been doing is basically forms of vigilantism.
8254660	8265703	They have gone after people who they have perceived have committed some sort of crime that's not being punished in the proper way and they are going after these people to make their lives miserable.
8265823	8269424	Yeah, they'll waste some of your time and some of your money and then that's it.
8269564	8270584	They'll get their plan across.
8270824	8276926	But when they've gone after people's information, it's been specific people to have a specific thing happen.
8277046	8278507	I've got to read some of these comments in chat.
8278547	8279367	They're piling up here.
8279487	8282428	In the true Easter spirit, Red Entertainment says the Jews did it.
8282908	8283428	Happy Easter.
8286459	8286920	And fuck you.
8287700	8294264	Defective Candy in our chat room says, the Epsilon email hacking was supposedly accomplished by one rogue individual.
8294305	8294585	Thank you.
8294625	8295185	It's Epsilon.
8295265	8296806	Could be a former employee.
8297106	8297667	It could be.
8297927	8298327	That's true.
8299068	8299428	Let's see.
8301129	8304271	SSJ100 Matt says, whatever happened to just blaming everything on 4chan?
8304431	8307093	I thought that was anonymous.
8307133	8308033	That's the home of anonymous.
8308053	8309374	Slash B. Yeah.
8309654	8310355	So there you go.
8310925	8311866	I like what Kajudo said.
8312366	8313747	I don't think Sony was a hack at all.
8313787	8316329	Someone lost the keys to the big Sony computer room and they can't all get in.
8317090	8318150	Check the crayon boxes.
8318971	8319592	Get that leash out.
8319692	8322374	There's like a cat that unplugged the thing.
8323855	8325476	I'm in your Sony hacking your store.
8327057	8331500	But seriously, look at everything.
8331721	8334823	Don't pick one convenient scapegoat.
8334903	8337645	That's not very smart, dude.
8339420	8339881	Next email.
8340141	8340581	Yes, please.
8340642	8341823	Yay, happy sunshine.
8343485	8345147	Unicorns that shit rainbows that kill people.
8345207	8345668	Yay.
8346609	8347410	Dear peoples.
8347890	8348811	We're peoples.
8349673	8350373	Oh, it's Red Entertainment.
8350393	8351375	Well, we are multiple people.
8352142	8357306	Like you, I've been following the recent PSN outages since I started popping up on Wednesday night.
8357727	8360929	When I first discovered these outages, I was frustrated, raged out, and cursed aloud.
8360969	8362290	My neighbors thought I was killing someone.
8362330	8362770	Not kidding.
8363391	8369055	Anyway, in the process of following the story, I found the story that I'm sure you covered earlier on the show.
8372398	8374540	Let me see what this is.
8374580	8378443	Hit by external... Yeah, it's the same story we covered, basically, from another source.
8379089	8385156	Once I read the story, I became considerably less angry as I can understand that Sony taking actions like this in response to this threat to a point.
8385537	8387639	However, there is one part of the story that really concerns me.
8388680	8396449	In order to, quote, verify the smooth and secure operation, end quote, of the services, Sony pulled the plug on both services April 20th.
8397310	8399791	The sentence gives me an impression that this isn't a simple hacking job.
8400171	8406314	Given Sony's recent movements in relation to piracy, I believe that this may be the nature of Sony taking down PSN.
8406974	8414058	I believe someone figured out how to pirate games distributed digitally via PSN.
8414118	8416319	Feel free to tell me if any of these conclusions are wrong.
8417239	8421020	Also, why do I have to go through PSN or live to access Hulu Plus or Netflix?
8421640	8428682	I mean, when I want to watch Hulu on my laptop, all I have to do is fire up my browser, go through my ISP to get to what I want to watch.
8429282	8435823	I don't have to go through my laptop's manufacturer-exclusive network to access things, so I don't have to do it on home consoles because they're evil.
8436424	8437484	Stay Black, Red Entertainment.
8437804	8444505	This message has been brought to you by the successor to Anonymous, who is actually responsible for PSN being shut down and totally unknown to the public.
8447242	8448082	Sent from my iPad.
8449763	8455345	Actually, we do have a theory in the chat room on who might be to blame for all of this that's going on on the PlayStation Network.
8456465	8457265	An interesting theory.
8470110	8471270	Yep, it's all Canada's fault.
8472190	8474071	Actually, we should blame Skynet.
8475852	8476772	We did survive Judgment Day.
8477217	8477485	We did.
8478640	8506460	in response to that email about why you have to authenticate with the console before you can use Netflix and Hulu for Netflix and Hulu to allow a third party appliance to run their service there needs to be some sort of accountability so that someone doesn't get an $8 Netflix account give their username and password to their 40 friends that have a Playstation 3 and have them all running Netflix off the one account so I think by authenticating into PSN
8508462	8515246	and it's saying this PSN account with this PlayStation 3 ID is using this Netflix and there's a sync there and that's why they do it.
8515406	8518508	However, it does not stop people from sharing Netflix accounts over the internet.
8518769	8520910	Blackwolf says that Netflix will still work.
8520930	8523192	You just got to keep trying to log in three to five times.
8523232	8524292	You can get in eventually.
8524913	8525333	Oh, okay.
8525713	8526654	I haven't tried on PS3.
8526674	8530957	I've just been, you know, playing Portal offline.
8532478	8532718	Addict.
8534511	8537092	Like it's a bad thing to be addicted to Portal.
8537172	8538853	You can get down with that one.
8539213	8539593	Totally.
8541014	8541254	Okay.
8541934	8542655	Hey, OLR.
8542955	8545116	I hope the move went well for you, Rob.
8545236	8547157	While you were busy with that, I was busy playing Portal 2.
8548077	8550958	That game has some of the best writing in anything, period.
8551238	8551659	Me too.
8551919	8553579	Salacious Pop, unpack that box.
8554000	8554880	I'm going to play Portal.
8555500	8556481	Let alone video games.
8556921	8560162	It certainly puts out what's out there to shame.
8560502	8562563	For some reason, I thought of you, Rob, when I saw this article.
8563043	8564024	Okay, I have to look at this.
8564480	8564801	Uh-oh.
8568726	8569466	It's still loading.
8569567	8569767	Hold on.
8569787	8571669	There's going to be huge spoilers and you're going to freak out.
8573612	8577396	Kagura director thought of Nintendo 3DS 3D breast 30 seconds later.
8577777	8579139	Hey, man.
8580520	8583184	It's a guy who did Half Minute Hero.
8585267	8585888	I'm telling you.
8586528	8588650	Didn't I talk about that on the show in the 3DS?
8588670	8591331	They just need a game that's boobs, boobs, and more boobs.
8592012	8592832	Boobs in 3D.
8592872	8593353	Big boobs.
8593413	8593953	Little boobs.
8594493	8595054	Black boobs.
8595114	8595654	White boobs.
8596154	8596615	All boobs.
8597115	8598676	Boobs with big nips.
8598856	8599837	Boobs with small nips.
8599997	8600517	All types.
8602539	8603940	United Nations of boobs.
8604600	8605421	Coming soon on the 3DS.
8606710	8613894	I don't know if you've ever heard of this before, but for the last few years there's been a convention dedicated to the world's favorite hedgehog held in London, Summer of Sonic.
8614394	8622578	They usually have early previews of coming games and occasionally panels slash Q&As with developers as well as writers for the old UK comic.
8622999	8624980	And I hear this year for the US comics too.
8625340	8627581	This year's is on July 25th if anyone's interested.
8627841	8628862	I would love to go.
8628942	8630202	Somebody get me to Europe.
8631543	8633785	hear you later, CatastrophicMagi P.S.
8633865	8638109	I'm really excited about the announcement of the Persona 4 anime P.P.S.
8638229	8640551	Hey Jamie, have you seen the new episode of Doctor Who yet?
8641772	8657104	Every time someone does the colon P I do Yes, I saw it and it was amazing and then I was really pissed off at the end and then I saw the preview for next episode so I wasn't as pissed off Okay I actually did pause it one time and go, that is bullshit and then kept watching
8660989	8662970	As I understand, I'm not the only person that did that.
8663190	8664351	Do I do that when I watch TV?
8664671	8665491	Yell back at the TV?
8666452	8668033	I don't think I do that.
8668453	8669053	I downloaded it.
8669693	8672655	Sometimes when I watch Survivor, I go, oh no, he didn't!
8673215	8674355	That's about as bad as I get.
8674416	8677097	You talk during WoW when something bad happens.
8677257	8678617	I do talk during WoW.
8678738	8679058	I do.
8679938	8681659	Thank God Ventrilo isn't always on.
8681679	8682879	Let's just say that much.
8683520	8685601	Why do you think I don't log into Ventrilo that often?
8686703	8688707	Dan is usually sitting right where you're sitting, Alan.
8689929	8694699	Looking over at me like, you really, really get dirty mouth when you play this game.
8694719	8696903	I was like, bitches.
8697344	8697605	So yeah.
8698976	8704020	and sometimes Rob will sign into Vent and just be like, oh, hey, what's going on?
8704220	8706461	And I'll be sitting right next to him and I'm like, I'm fine.
8706582	8709143	I'm reading, I'm reading, oh, no, they didn't.
8709163	8710444	He's like, I'm on Vent, duh.
8710464	8711785	I'm like, I don't know your life.
8711805	8712646	Yeah.
8714948	8716008	All right, is that it for emails?
8717819	8718299	That is it.
8718580	8720381	We need more emails for next week.
8720421	8722182	We need to beat the emails we had this week.
8722222	8724984	I want DarkSakura's email bag to take like an hour next week.
8725364	8725764	Mailbag.
8725784	8732989	Hey, if this happens, okay, if we get, okay, if we break 10 emails next week, you have to get me tacos.
8735219	8736419	I'm gonna get you tacos.
8737020	8737380	Fine.
8737920	8738700	You want, fine.
8738840	8742062	We get more than 10 emails and not all from the same address.
8742522	8743662	Not all from the same address.
8743962	8745103	And 10 meaningful emails.
8745123	8748884	Unique, real emails that are at least a paragraph in length.
8749124	8750265	And with good grammar.
8750285	8752326	Three to four sentences with proper grammar.
8752906	8753886	Rob will buy me tacos.
8754006	8755187	Yes, I will buy you tacos.
8756767	8757908	Taco flavored pink berry.
8757928	8758468	Ew.
8759318	8766812	They're gonna be from emails like, you know, ShermieCat, or ThisIsTotallyNotDan Sorry mom, I pooped in the kitchen again!
8768334	8769275	Love your cat.
8769535	8771097	Number one Dan fan at Gmail.
8771117	8772338	You should have Dan on more often.
8772358	8772518	P.S.
8772738	8773139	Bart.
8775301	8781466	We should get like a taco tote board and like show how many emails we've got during the week and then be like, let's see if Jamie's going to get tacos.
8782227	8784269	Oh, we're at seven emails so far this week.
8784790	8785891	No taco for Jamie.
8785911	8787772	Can we install that on the website?
8788954	8789674	The taco meter.
8790335	8791316	The taco meter.
8791906	8795568	I've already declared that Taco Tuesday is an official holiday every week.
8796109	8799731	Black Wolf says, can I write a paragraph about how tasty the tacos would be?
8801492	8802212	Yes, you can.
8802372	8803973	I will accept emails about tacos.
8803993	8806135	Because tacos are amazing.
8807199	8809881	Or, you know, you can also do it about taco, which is octopus.
8810181	8810802	I love taco yaki.
8811082	8815766	Or, you could write a dissertation about the 80s song, Puttin' on the Ritz, by Taco.
8817127	8817287	No.
8817807	8822611	It has to be video game related, or actual delicious crispy taco related.
8822851	8825053	Or, tostadas, I take those too.
8825193	8827755	For fuck's sake, can we move on to another topic?
8827775	8828515	Taco!
8828815	8829036	Okay.
8830703	8836190	Alright, if you want to send us an email, of course, mailbag.orangeloungeradio.com This is the part of the show where we get angsty.
8836250	8837652	It's the FUs of the Week segment.
8854946	8868302	DarkSakura My FU goes to being really hungry right now because over the last whole week I've maybe had at most 400 calories a day because I haven't really been able to keep anything down.
8868622	8870164	By the way, that candle came from the dollar store.
8871425	8872246	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8899324	8900986	I ate matzo when I woke up.
8902087	8903628	And I normally do not like matzo by itself.
8904329	8904829	I ate some.
8905310	8906952	I want food.
8907452	8908213	I want a salad.
8909314	8911236	Actually, what I want is Pink Fairy, but it probably closed.
8912146	8914068	The whole Easter thing kind of makes places close.
8914288	8919652	But a heart to you from my wonderful coffee.
8919772	8920292	Oh, you're welcome.
8920493	8922754	Which is why I have some semblance of alertness.
8922954	8926437	Folks don't know, but a lot of times before the show I do make a Starbucks run.
8927138	8928158	There's Starbucks everywhere.
8928219	8932942	Like saying there's one not far from Jamie's house is like, you know, gee, there's grass in the backyard.
8934724	8935784	But yeah, there's a Starbucks nearby.
8935804	8938586	I don't tend to get coffee a lot.
8938947	8941709	I'm actually going to if I have it at night, it's going to be decaf.
8941969	8943630	Yeah, you did request a decaf.
8943710	8944710	I'll remember that in the future.
8945910	8948671	Alright, SalaciousPop, do you have any FUs for this week?
8950072	8954073	Just not being completely 100% done with my old place.
8954953	8958334	I'm happy for my former roommate because he found someone to move in with him.
8959375	8965857	But just that, having to go back to San Francisco one last time and just unpacking in general is obnoxious.
8966677	8968378	But otherwise, that's all.
8969138	8969578	Pretty minor.
8970550	8996480	um yeah I don't have a lot to be angsty about I mean there's a lot of really good stuff going on for me right now a lot of like happy news I don't want to make you par for nothing but it's good stuff I will say F you to that freaking headache I had earlier there was almost migraine status I would say I would say like if headaches were on like the terrorism color chart I would say the headache I had was code orange it was pretty bad but it wasn't like really bad so there you go
8998121	9001843	All right, that does it for the FUs of the week for now.
9001884	9002264	Moving on.
9002724	9009989	Blackwolf is pointing out in our chat room that apparently Taco Bell has a lame flash game called Taco Fu at TacoBell.com slash Taco Fu.
9010009	9010729	That's okay.
9011009	9013331	Way to merge the worlds of tacos and video games.
9013551	9015252	Just want to give an A plus to Bobby.
9015292	9017253	Looks like a... That's why he has his own show, folks.
9017313	9019415	Burger King's reigning...
9020075	9023618	Dude, Sneak King and shit, those games were awesome.
9023658	9024238	Like, why?
9024599	9026380	Like, for five bucks, they were great.
9026640	9028742	Why didn't they ever do that again?
9028762	9032584	They should do an update, a new BurgerTime and call it TacoTime.
9033405	9035707	Weren't they supposed to do something with Kinect, I thought?
9036107	9036527	DarkSakura.com
9061781	9066846	Okay, so Ubisoft is developing a guitar game.
9067046	9079778	It seems like maybe they'd be a little... That trainer has left the station, perhaps, but they're working on a game called Rocksmith, which sounds a lot like Pro Mode in Rock Band, except with a guitar.
9080178	9083441	You can play this game with real guitars, and the...
9085203	9093428	The UI and how the notes, because you know how DJ Hero, Guitar Hero, Rock Band has the note highway that scrolls vertically.
9093989	9101854	This one uses more of a 3D plane where you're in front and you see the notes coming from the back of the screen moving towards you.
9103175	9104395	So it looks really complicated.
9104436	9106457	I'm not sure how much of a market there might be for this.
9107117	9113982	But anyway, they are demoing the game at South by Southwest in Texas, which is a
9115836	9144279	it's a music and movies it's kind of like a hipstery I know I was like if you want to find a place where all the hipsters are at at one time like that's not Tumblr yeah but it's not like a Lollapalooza there are a lot of great bands there but it's also movies and art and it's a whole pop culture thing so yeah Rocksmith is going to be at South by Southwest they're going to have musicians play it and just show it off I think they've got a whole Rocksmith tour bus that sets up bass and it's going to be at South by Southwest fun
9145020	9150352	Yeah, I like the way they've done that where they have like the guitar silhouette in front of the falling stream of notes.
9150392	9151735	It's kind of a neat little way to do it.
9152757	9152878	Hmm.
9153496	9157778	All right, we'll see if this game can actually be successful, kind of break the recent curse of music games.
9158558	9158938	We'll see.
9159938	9161759	One more story for you guys.
9163140	9165240	Everybody get out your 40s and get ready to pour it.
9166221	9168942	The PSP Go is officially dead.
9169102	9170102	That's right, folks.
9170182	9171163	Pour out the 40s.
9171903	9172703	Devastated.
9173023	9173924	How did this happen?
9174244	9174804	I know.
9174924	9177205	This is... I don't understand.
9177905	9198452	apparently the whole thing is started by a Sony shop employee saying that the store was not going to get any more shipments and then the PSP Go disappeared from the Sony store page Sony is not confirming the news but in their statement they're kind of trying to say well why are you asking about the Go shouldn't we be talking about the NGP the awesome new system coming out from Sony
9199429	9204716	Yeah, so although Sony hasn't confirmed it, they haven't really denied it either.
9205417	9208301	In the UK as well, the PSP Go production has ceased.
9208341	9209302	That has been proven.
9209702	9211925	So the PSP Go, it's dead.
9212606	9214629	So it's basically become the sort of
9216281	9222025	The cousin that is touched in the head that now lives in the attic that the family doesn't talk about.
9222765	9224747	Those thuds that you hear, we don't know.
9225747	9227348	No, he died when he was born.
9227369	9228129	We don't know who that is.
9228609	9229930	Some of the comments from our chat room.
9229970	9233393	Of course, the raging comedy club that is the Orange Lounge Radio chat room.
9233713	9235814	Frisbee calls it the PSP Go Away.
9236715	9237075	Let's see.
9237295	9239997	Redertainment says, wait, the PSP Go wasn't already dead?
9241038	9245981	Alpha Cananigram says, wait, wasn't this debunked saying only Europe isn't going to carry it and US is still going to have them?
9246601	9250502	All right, shall we open up the Skype line?
9271351	9272251	Yes, do it!
9295783	9297004	Game OLR
9321065	9327109	Nothing much, just like chilling in my room, fixing other people's PCs, resting up for tomorrow's work day.
9327510	9328110	What's tomorrow?
9328190	9328570	Oh, work?
9328630	9329271	Back to the grind?
9329971	9331072	Yeah, back to the grind.
9331412	9332133	Evil grind.
9332713	9333954	Evil post-Easter grind.
9335135	9339138	You want to talk about something from our show or some other story we didn't cover?
9339218	9349525	I've noticed that the folks at Gearbox have been really good sports recently with that proposal that they did, you know, that Borderlands proposal that they did for this fan out in Texas.
9350625	9360631	I have the video where I think Claptrap actually, the voice of Claptrap, actually they put up a video using that as a way to propose to a girl.
9360911	9361151	Yep.
9361691	9362752	Just pull it up right now.
9362972	9367674	Yeah, we did cover it at the top of the segment, just so you know if you missed it.
9368295	9368995	We did talk about it.
9369615	9370316	What did you think about it?
9371209	9372971	Gearbox Gearbox is also like
9394266	9394506	Exactly.
9416144	9424610	That is how history will smile upon them fondly, unless the game is the most atrocious piece of shit we've ever played, but I'm hoping it's not that bad.
9424910	9434436	Now, even though you do mention shit in that sentence, you do know you could actually use excrement as a weapon in that game.
9434996	9436137	Hooray, I'm so excited.
9436778	9439660	Yes, you could actually shit bomb people in that game.
9439700	9443843	I've always wanted to fling my poo in a video game where I wasn't playing as a monkey.
9445924	9446545	I'm touched.
9447665	9449807	Just a while ago, I actually seen the video.
9451428	9453209	And yeah, I know it's shocking.
9453269	9461335	I mean, right now, I'm just trying to gather up the... Just trying to see what I can get right now in terms of games.
9461375	9461535	Like...
9462871	9463952	Mortal Kombat vs. Capcom 3
9477230	9480272	It's either that or, I mean, it's that and Eleanor and Brink.
9480852	9484415	So it's like, it's going to be, we're about, we're approaching some busy times.
9485015	9486976	I think the busy time was this past week.
9487036	9494801	I mean, something that didn't even freaking occur to me is that this week and the next week, depending on where you live, is spring break.
9495321	9498303	Usually it's either the week before or the week after Easter is spring break.
9498343	9499004	Ours just ended.
9499084	9500545	So these games coming out.
9501065	9502646	What, in Japan or getting hammered by Anonymous?
9502706	9505068	I'm pretty sure they cracked open one of their holes.
9528261	9533084	I think this is somebody who's done something a lot more serious than the DDoS.
9533505	9535486	I think personal information has been compromised.
9535846	9537788	I think there's going to be more to develop on this.
9538148	9539849	Again, I could be talking out of my butt.
9539889	9540450	That's fine.
9540490	9542291	I'm some schmo with a podcast on the internet.
9542551	9545814	But when Sony isn't being up front, I'm left to speculate.
9545894	9552779	Sony is basically acting like any other Japanese person would by not revealing any damning information at the moment.
9554180	9558364	They're trying to make it seem not as bad as it is, but it's a lot worse.
9559084	9568313	I mean, as I said, you could draw parallels to the way Japan handled the whole nuclear reactor crisis and the way they were with that power company.
9568573	9573336	Aren't we getting a little... Okay, isn't this a little tinfoil hat?
9573856	9575958	No, it's like, it's any government.
9576058	9580760	The Japanese are very, you know, they're open about it, though.
9580841	9587705	They're basically, they openly lie to people so that way they can look good, or they can not stir any panic.
9588205	9598071	Because, would you rather hear from Sony that personal information has been compromised now, and then you're going to have people bitching in the forums and everywhere else, and Congress getting involved?
9598464	9604490	or would you rather have that later on when it's less of a problem and they're actually back online?
9604630	9607953	I would rather have it now because it's my fucking information.
9609515	9611377	Well, that's up to Sony to decide.
9611837	9613639	They personally have it in their possession.
9614339	9617663	You gave it to them as a contract to join PSN.
9617683	9622788	So it's not like you can get it back somehow.
9624127	9631274	But you have to realize that I'm pretty certain it's a lot worse than what they're actually going to say.
9632054	9637079	They don't want to create panic or else that's going to hurt their stock, that's going to hurt their reputation.
9637369	9639050	Right, and that's all part of the panic.
9655982	9670909	If they say that now unless they find a way to do damage control then it's going to sink their stock pretty fast unless they find a way to say it in a way where it's not that big of a threat.
9672839	9674000	Even though it actually is.
9674120	9685187	But that's the whole point is that they have to, from a PR perspective, they have to release it in a way that it doesn't impact their reputation and whatever else they have on the line.
9685407	9686408	Alright, well we will see.
9686448	9695674	Next week, I think we can both agree that next week is going to be a very interesting week and hopefully we're not sitting here a week from now saying, oh, we're on day 12 of the PSN outage.
9696075	9697856	Alright, Zacco, I gotta let you go to get more calls.
9698376	9701578	I can't wait to see what emails we get in response to your call tonight, but have a good one, buddy.
9701818	9702379	Alright, have a good one.
9702399	9702619	Later.
9703820	9704140	Alright.
9704761	9707463	The views and opinions expressed by the callers not necessarily reflect those.
9707523	9709364	Alright.
9709384	9712367	1-877-GAME-OLR or I use your name on Skype as Orange Lounge Radio.
9712607	9716910	Salacious Pop doing his due diligence during that call finding some last minute stories.
9717110	9717851	Gold star for you.
9718822	9729492	South Korea yesterday voted on a curfew that would prevent children under the age of 15 to play online games from midnight until 6am.
9729732	9732214	So no more all-nighters for the StarCraft 2.
9732875	9734396	It's all PC gaming it sounds like.
9734456	9735917	Instead you need to be studying.
9736178	9736258	Yep.
9736938	9742443	And I guess it's being blocked on the ISP level, the DNS, to the gaming servers.
9742783	9745446	If the parents register that they have a kid, they get cut off.
9745506	9747528	Kind of scary what the government can do at that level.
9747588	9748588	It's very interesting.
9748609	9748809	All right.
9749109	9749770	We got a phone call.
9749930	9750170	Hold on.
9750190	9751691	We'll revisit this thought in a minute.
9751751	9752652	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9752672	9752972	Who's this?
9753753	9754274	Hey, guys.
9754294	9755114	This is Blue Swim.
9755254	9756155	Hi, Blue Swim.
9756255	9757356	Oh, I love the enthusiasm.
9757396	9758077	How are you, my friend?
9759078	9759858	I'm doing just fine.
9759878	9760619	How about you guys?
9760739	9761039	Good.
9761100	9762321	I wish we had more callers calling in.
9762361	9763362	Hey, guys.
9764673	9767874	First time caller as well.
9768074	9768995	What's on your mind, Blue Swim?
9770455	9779819	I was wondering what you guys thought of BlazBlue, Continuum Shift 2, and Dead or Alive Dimensions going practically head-to-head at the end of May.
9781249	9786052	Um, well, you know, it's not the first time that fighters have really gone against each other, I don't think.
9786152	9793736	Didn't Street Fighter 4 come out at the same time as... Oh, God, there was something else that came out, I thought, right around the same time.
9793776	9794696	Maybe somebody in Chow will get me.
9794856	9797117	Yeah, but we ignored it because it was Street Fighter 4 coming out.
9797718	9798178	For real.
9798838	9798918	Um...
9800519	9814305	I think these two series are kind of separate enough where they can coexist peacefully because let's face it, BlazBlue, BlazBlue, whatever you want to call it, very heavily Japanese influenced, very anime, very, you know, all that stuff.
9814645	9822268	Dead or Alive, as much as it's very Japanese as well, don't get me wrong, it's very much more for the T&A audience.
9822788	9823609	Tickle, tickle.
9824089	9824429	There you go.
9824469	9827590	It's more of the Texas game because everything's bigger in Texas.
9827610	9828471	Yeah.
9829899	9835880	and so that's kind of why I'm like I think these two games can coexist they have very different audiences
9837520	9851173	Do you think that with the 3DS having three major fighters in the first two months of its life, it's going to turn it into a portable fighting game, like the portable fighting game platform?
9851574	9852334	Yes and no.
9852495	9858020	I mean, when those three games are probably the only three games worth owning on the 3DS right now, yes a little bit.
9858340	9859281	No, I shouldn't say that.
9859361	9860422	I also bought Pilotwings.
9860462	9861143	I haven't played it yet.
9861623	9883427	uh it's just it's a little frustrating there wasn't a bigger title um but you know looking at what Street Fighter 4 does I mean it really brings pretty much the whole experience of the Xbox version to the portable console and what's interesting about that is that a lot of times you used to hear this shit right like when Mortal Kombat came out on the Game Boy it was like
9883887	9890434	experience the arcade experience on the go and it's like, dude, this game fucking blows.
9890774	9895139	Like, I've got two buttons and it's all like boop, boop, boop, boop.
9895199	9896881	It's got like three frames a second.
9897141	9898102	This game sucks.
9898943	9899964	But Street Fighter 4, it
9901525	9904447	Pretty much plays really like the Xbox versions.
9904787	9907769	I'll tell you my biggest bitch about the game is the controls.
9908229	9918035	Like, I think it's because I'm not a kid and I have fat hands, but the 3DS thing does not feel very good in my fat hands for trying to play a fighter with the L and R buttons and everything.
9918075	9926340	The analog thumb thing, in my opinion, is too slippery and the D-pad is too small for my giant spindly man hands.
9926480	9929962	And I don't like where the D-pad is positioned as far as like a fighting game goes.
9930062	9930843	It's a little weird.
9931533	9937698	Yeah, it cramps the crap out of my hands when I'm playing Bison, trying to do a knee-press nightmare or something like that.
9937838	9939039	It kills my fingers.
9939279	9946004	Yet, I decided to go online and do the whole internet match earlier, and I got my ass handed to me by some asshole playing as Cody.
9946565	9951529	Seems like every asshole on Street Fighter 4 plays Cody, and I call them assholes because they're better than me.
9954011	9956733	What fighting game are you looking forward to out of those two?
9958410	9963434	I pretty much bought the 3DS at launch, expecting Dead or Alive to be there.
9963554	9969019	I've been a hardcore Dead or Alive fan since 2002, I want to say.
9969359	9977305	It's prevented me from trading in my original Xbox when I discovered the Dead or Alive 3 demo on the demo disc.
9977465	9977606	Mm-hmm.
9978646	9983632	and ever since then I've been absolutely hooked on the franchise.
9984012	9991019	I've put maybe 300 hours into Dead or Alive Ultimate and another 100 plus in Dead or Alive 4.
9991900	9998827	I find it very interesting how they've talked about this whole it's going to run 30 frames a second in 3D but it'll run 60 frames a second in 2D.
10000169	10003311	That's a distinction I don't notice as much in like Super Street Fighter 4.
10003511	10005413	It kind of looks the same no matter what mode you're in.
10006394	10008575	Did you turn the 3D off in the options menu?
10008595	10013399	Because if you turn the slider off, it'll still render the game in 30 frames per second.
10013419	10021606	But when you turn the 3D option off in the options menu and you're playing like offline, it is absolutely gorgeous.
10022267	10023267	I haven't.
10023668	10024629	I need to try that.
10024709	10025349	What a good tip.
10025429	10026290	I'm glad we do this show.
10026310	10027471	See, even I learn shit on this show.
10027851	10028351	No, I haven't.
10028372	10029072	I'm going to try that.
10030093	10030393	Nice.
10030593	10031554	Maybe that's what I'm missing.
10032294	10034656	That's going to run very fluid when I try that.
10034676	10035096	That's cool.
10036297	10046905	The 60 frames doesn't carry over to the online portion, unfortunately, but if you're playing the arcade mode or versus mode or whatever, it's just gorgeous.
10047045	10052089	Real quick, before we let you go, because we've got to fit in at least one more call tonight, have you had any luck with the Street Pass in Super Street Fighter 4?
10052950	10056652	Not a bit, and I've been carrying that thing with me almost constantly.
10056692	10064035	I live near Nashville, and there's a ton of stores around here, Best Buy and GameStop and stuff like that.
10064055	10066736	I have not had one street pass fight with it.
10066796	10067356	Interesting.
10067396	10070317	I'm hearing those things aren't activating very much, and it could be a variety of things.
10070337	10072098	It could be that the battery life is so eh.
10072558	10075820	on those things that it's not pulsing the StreetPass very often.
10075860	10076881	That's kind of one thing I'm hearing.
10077201	10081304	And then the other is just, you know, how many people carry their DS in sleep mode with them everywhere they go?
10081364	10081944	Very few.
10083045	10083485	So I don't know.
10083505	10084386	I'm going to try this week.
10084406	10087448	I'm going to try going to the mall this week and see if I get anybody on StreetPass.
10087748	10088929	At least walk into GameStop.
10088949	10090870	You know some of those employees have got to have it going.
10091291	10091691	We'll see.
10092111	10099956	I think that's where I got one of my StreetPass me's was GameStop and the other was like a demo unit of Best Buy.
10102478	10104579	I never thought of trying a demo unit at Best Buy.
10104599	10105399	That's a great idea.
10105859	10106280	We'll see.
10106740	10110201	Alright, Blue Swim, I've got to let you go so we can get more calls, but thanks for the call.
10110842	10111482	Thank you very much.
10111602	10112102	Have a good night.
10112162	10112562	You too.
10112902	10113723	Happy birthday, Jamie.
10114183	10114563	Thank you.
10115884	10118365	See, I like enthusiastic callers.
10119145	10120365	I'm just really happy to be here.
10121866	10122366	Exciting.
10122947	10123207	Alright.
10124387	10125728	I want more happy people.
10127944	10129906	Everyone, Blue Swim should be your role model.
10130146	10130466	All right.
10131327	10133668	Other stories that you've got, Salacious Popper.
10133688	10135570	I don't know if you want to finish your thoughts on that last one.
10136330	10147719	Well, I was just saying that for the South Korea gaming curfew, that's a part of the world, not necessarily just South Korea, where people will just stop peeing when they play StarCraft II and then they die.
10147859	10149180	Their bladder explodes and they die.
10149300	10151782	So obviously I think there's a demand for that kind of regulation.
10152301	10154362	I forgot to mention, I played some more StarCraft 2 this week.
10154722	10157663	StarJeweled is my new favorite add-on ever for StarCraft.
10158143	10158643	It's great.
10158903	10163144	You play Bejeweled, and then you use the points you get in Bejeweled to, like, buy units.
10163484	10164705	And it's like a tug-of-war match.
10164925	10165245	Fun.
10165405	10166225	It's awesome.
10166425	10170507	Like, Jamie, you might actually like StarCraft 2 if I were to buy that.
10170947	10171247	I don't know.
10171267	10173367	Hi, I'm here.
10173988	10174228	I'm here.
10175268	10175508	I'm here.
10175948	10177709	You gotta fix that.
10178089	10180210	I don't know why, but I'm hearing myself come through.
10180410	10181390	You gotta fix your settings.
10182113	10183074	But thank you for the bags.
10184955	10187256	Alright, we'll see.
10187316	10188817	Maybe he'll fix that and try calling back.
10188837	10191298	Which nobody else but the people in this room and he will get.
10191318	10196300	1-877-GAME-OLR Username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
10196681	10198602	Echo123 is always a good way to text us.
10198662	10201063	That's somebody who calls us pretty regularly though, so I don't know what's going on.
10201697	10204939	Quick last minute story, Minecraft has two million paid.
10206319	10207960	Fuck, that's a game I still haven't played.
10208020	10208500	Can you believe it?
10208520	10214943	Two million people have paid for the beta access, which is roughly 28, 29% of its entire user base.
10215784	10224707	So a little under a third of their player base has paid for the game for a little indie sandbox kind of Aspie thing.
10224728	10225568	That's pretty impressive.
10226007	10245582	you know some are saying it's too early to call Portal 2 the game of the year when you have something like Minecraft out there it has that same 3D with the weird spritey problem I can't play it for very long I need to check it out we need to play Minecraft we need to have a Minecraft night try to figure out why people lose their shit over this game
10245822	10252371	I think it's 15 euros, which translates to like 20 bucks or 22 bucks US because the euros are worth more than the dollar.
10252611	10252851	Yeah.
10253532	10254654	I remember being like 19.
10255274	10256356	They have a demo though, right?
10256556	10259480	Can't you play it for, isn't there like demo levels?
10259540	10260141	I've got it.
10260581	10260842	Do you?
10260942	10261723	The demo somewhere.
10261843	10262083	Yeah.
10262184	10262484	Hold on.
10262644	10262985	I want it.
10264266	10272111	1-877-GAME-OLR I'm going to try keeping it open one more second, especially if that last guy can get their thing fixed.
10272151	10272692	I'm so bad.
10272732	10273272	I always forget.
10273292	10275173	I still have Ragnarok online.
10275854	10276394	Let's see.
10276854	10280597	An obvious spam person out of Bulgaria wants to be our friend.
10281137	10281638	Block.
10283679	10284340	That's no fun.
10284360	10286321	Alright, we're going to try this one more time.
10286381	10287482	Give this guy one more chance here.
10287842	10288723	Let's go back to the phones.
10288743	10289984	No, it's still echoing.
10292635	10292895	Hello?
10293436	10293816	Hello?
10294277	10295077	Now I'm not hearing you.
10295237	10295978	Yay, you fixed it.
10295998	10297499	Yeah, I wasn't doing it before.
10297559	10299561	You hung up, and I was like, okay, that's kind of weird.
10299581	10301282	And I tried Echo, and Echo came out fine.
10301502	10301883	That's weird.
10301903	10302683	All right, well, it works now.
10302703	10303304	What's on your mind, buddy?
10304283	10305184	By the way, this is X-Link.
10305224	10305884	Hi, X-Link.
10306004	10306445	Sorry.
10307185	10308346	No, it's quite all right.
10308486	10310227	I recognize your voice at this point.
10310287	10311448	What's on your mind, buddy?
10311848	10313469	You know, actually, it was kind of funny.
10313669	10323875	Another caller kind of talked about this earlier, but the whole Val thing in Portal 2, I was watching the whole thing as it unfolded right before Portal 2 came out, the ARG.
10325976	10334303	and it's kind of cool reading the stories of how Valve gave pretty much open access to these indie companies.
10334423	10336444	Basically telling, hey, you wanna be part of this?
10336564	10345071	Come on in, we'll give you full access, we'll help you any way possible, we'll give you all these materials, we'll do anything we can to make this work.
10345271	10353738	And it was really cool reading some of the company stories of how everything progressed from day one to the night of,
10354838	10370627	The release of when everything got completed Is that the whole thing I heard at the tail end of Bobby's show Where there's like an iPad app that Jeff Keighley was involved with Where they've like chronicled the entire last development cycle of Portal Is that what you're talking about?
10370687	10380332	Most likely yes And I don't know exactly what the app has in it Because I don't have it right now And I don't have the money for it So I can't really tell
10381592	10400289	The impression that I'm getting from our pal Bobby, who talked about it a little bit more on his show tonight, is that it's basically like, imagine an interactive news article, or I should say magazine feature, because it's more like a 10,000 word article or something like that, that has videos, pictures, behind the scenes stuff.
10401598	10401918	Probably.
10402639	10407122	Yeah, it kind of sounds like honestly what more magazines ought to be doing on the iPad.
10407682	10408383	Yeah.
10409383	10421532	And how all these people, these groups of people don't know each other and are willing going, hey, I have a free copy of AudioSurf I'm willing to give to you so that way you get your potatoes so that way we can make the multiplier faster so we can
10422653	10427576	It was very cool seeing everybody come together, the squad going, okay, which game should we play?
10427616	10431599	We should play this one so this way the timer can go down more and more and more.
10431759	10435902	And it was just very neat watching the whole thing as it unfolded.
10435982	10436743	It was very cool.
10437683	10458941	that is yeah I'm I did I did play I did my part I played audio surf it was fun even though I had no intention of buying it on PC because I knew I'd already had the PS3 one ordered but it was still it was you know it's fun I like those things kind of get the community riled up like that and Valve is a heck of a company that's that's really what it boils down to I mean they does has Valve ever put out a bad game
10459730	10461872	No, not that I know of.
10462112	10466596	Valve is in a very elite group of developers that just does not put out bad games.
10466656	10469219	And I would say Blizzard's probably in there too.
10469699	10472361	Blizzard I don't think has ever put out a bad game until Cataclysm.
10472461	10473222	No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
10474043	10476825	And then, let's see, what else?
10476845	10478267	There's got to be at least one other.
10478807	10479788	I'm sure there's many folks.
10480108	10484913	BioWare has a pedigree, but that's... Then you're getting to the more...
10485733	10489934	See, part of me would say, well, Bethesda, because they put out such awesome stuff.
10489954	10493215	But then I'm like, oh, but they did that Star Trek game that was really not good.
10493835	10500517	So, you know, a lot of developers do have little blemishes on their record or bizarre creations before they close.
10500557	10502458	But they made that Bond game that wasn't so hot.
10502538	10503898	So unfortunately, they had a blemish, too.
10504418	10509120	You know, so but there's very rare companies in the mid-market, depending on what the people want at the time.
10509180	10509680	So, I mean.
10510560	10511821	and it depends on who does it too.
10511941	10515002	A lot of it depends on how much work they put into it.
10515022	10521864	If they're gonna put it in work for six months, they throw it out there in the market and expect it to sell and it turns out to be a complete piece of shit.
10521904	10523284	You can't really get too much from it.
10523504	10530286	It's obvious they took a lot of time and effort behind what they want and it really paid off.
10530426	10531667	It paid off in big time.
10533197	10537461	Like I said before, people were very happy with this whole thing and the way it unfolded at the end.
10537741	10539923	And then, of course, with Portal 2 being the way it is.
10540964	10544007	Kaijudo in our chatroom says, Valve put out that shitty poker game.
10544367	10545668	I believe that was Telltale, wasn't it?
10546169	10548230	That was Telltale, and it's not really that bad.
10548371	10549432	It's really fun.
10549772	10550913	It's a budget title.
10551013	10553655	The budget title is really short, and I kind of wish they would add...
10557495	10564079	And telltales about in that pedigree too I mean it kind of depends how into the games they're putting out you are But they put out a lot of quality stuff too
10576386	10576586	Yeah.
10576947	10582153	So anyway, sorry, I don't want to turn this into a developer penis size contest, but you know, I thought it would be fun.
10582173	10593087	And the gearbox and the gearbox is very interesting to that whole story about the proposal to you should watch both the videos first the video of the proposal and then how they all came about because
10593587	10593887	and so on.
10616949	10617849	Oh, wow, I didn't even know that.
10618510	10620971	Something Force with the Marine, Adrian Shepard.
10621011	10624513	But the Half-Life expansions that came out in 98, 99, that was Gearbox.
10625833	10626293	Well, there you go.
10626774	10630375	All right, well, X-Link, I got to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but any other quick final thoughts?
10630916	10631876	No, that's about it.
10631916	10633397	Sorry about the call earlier.
10633457	10634177	Sorry about all that.
10634197	10635458	I usually don't have any of those problems.
10635498	10637579	I usually call Echo 1, 2, 3 beforehand.
10637699	10638819	Minus 50 DKP.
10639520	10640620	Yeah, no joke.
10640780	10641040	Later.
10641621	10641861	Later.
10642697	10644219	Alright, that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
10644239	10647683	If you didn't get through, help Jamie get tacos by sending an email instead.
10647723	10652228	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com How did I fucking agree to buy her fucking tacos?
10653189	10653930	I am awesome.
10654731	10655011	Alright.
10655472	10657354	And Skype crashed right as I closed it.
10657434	10657755	Great.
10658275	10658516	Heart.
10659216	10659436	I know.
10659836	10660096	All right.
10660356	10662717	Well, that's a sign that we need to wrap up the show and get on out of here.
10662757	10666458	So we can't wrap up the show, though, until we go around and get some final thoughts.
10667418	10670078	Oh, actually, I should ask if you have any other quick last minute stories you want to get out.
10670738	10671058	No.
10671279	10671659	No, you're good.
10672079	10672259	All right.
10672279	10674359	Well, then I will say thank you very much for being here.
10674499	10675459	Salacious Pop tonight.
10675819	10678640	Really appreciate it, especially on short notice and filling in for Loki.
10678660	10680420	You did a great job with the stories and everything.
10680480	10681441	It's been a very fun show.
10681781	10684481	Not everybody can just waltz right in here and read the stories.
10684521	10685361	So really appreciate it.
10685381	10685882	Hope you had fun.
10685982	10686262	Thank you.
10686562	10686902	As always.
10686922	10688222	Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners?
10691407	10695089	Remember to go outside and don't play too much Portal 2 and Mortal Kombat back to back.
10695509	10695889	That's right.
10697950	10700311	My final thought is now I want tacos.
10700791	10701271	I hate you.
10701791	10702372	You don't.
10702392	10703012	You're right, I don't.
10704393	10705193	But right now I do.
10706253	10707654	DarkSakura, your final thought tonight.
10707894	10708594	I'm hungry.
10708934	10709975	I want a taco.
10710955	10712356	I guess that seems to be the theme tonight.
10712856	10720921	Tune in next week when you'll find out where did we get tacos on the very informative episode 411 of Orange Launch Radio next week.
10720941	10721561	See what I did there?
10721581	10722121	See what I did there?
10722141	10722602	All right.
10722962	10726464	By the way, if you like the show... If that's gonna go, then I hate to see episode 420.
10727685	10732087	Which was supposed to land on our nine-year anniversary, but apparently they're off by like a week, so we'll see.
10732107	10732968	All right, anyhow.
10733729	10734129	DarkSakura.com
10749328	10753812	All we ask you guys, if you like what you hear on the show, leave us a nice review on iTunes.
10753912	10754993	Tell a friend about the show.
10755313	10759157	Help us spread the word because we don't have a giant magazine company behind us.
10759617	10764241	We're not getting paid $70,000 a year to do journalism or whatever.
10764701	10765742	Just spread the word.
10765762	10766343	That's all we ask.
10766383	10771107	Tell a friend about what we're doing here, and that's the juice that keeps our show powered.
10772108	10773029	That and peeps.
10773849	10774871	Just kidding.
10775372	10776533	Alright, that does it.
10776814	10778316	Have a good night everybody.
10778576	10781100	We'll see you next week here on Orange Lounge Radio.
