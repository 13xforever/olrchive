Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:08.000
Who's your hosts?

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
DarkSakura

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
Sky and Lowkey

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
Tonight, April 24th, 2011

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
Is EA Sports set to roll out a new paid subscription service?

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
Child of Eden is delayed on one platform

00:22.000 --> 00:26.000
And could an upcoming paid demo determine the fate of Mega Man Legends 3?

00:26.000 --> 00:29.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
And welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
It's the show where every gamer has a voice

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
We tape live at All Games Radio

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
www.allgames.com

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
Every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
My name is Rob Roberts

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-hosts

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
First up, the one and only

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
DarkSakura, Jamie Summers

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
Hi

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
How are you?

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
Feeling far better than I did previously

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
Yes

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
I can eat now

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
I'm sorry to hear you were sick and all

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
What happened?

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
You just had a

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
No idea, I think it was just a bug

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
That's too bad

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
It had to have been a virus because nobody else got sick

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
Do you feel refreshed after a week off?

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
We weren't here last week

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
And you were really the only one that didn't have anything going

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
Well, I don't know if you ended up doing something else

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
But Lowkey's my fault

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
I got to spend a good night with my boy

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
Good, good

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
Little date night

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
More of a hanging out

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
How cute

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
Hey, I think we actually played some more Final Fantasy that night

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
Oh, your little Final Fantasy megathon or whatever you're doing?

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
Yeah, whenever we get back to it

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
We got the level up, the job change

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
Okay, there you go

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
Oh, so you're still on one

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
But you're now probably what, halfway through one

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
Because that's about the halfway point of the game

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
Little more maybe

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
Yeah, cool, cool

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
Well, I'm not here tonight sadly

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
Techmaster Lowkey is not here

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
I don't know, there's something about like

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
Baby's first Easter

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
And all this like, I gotta do family stuff

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
Like, whatever, nice excuse

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
Alright, no, just kidding, obviously

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
Understandable

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
I can't wait until next year when they're all like

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
We've done all this, who cares

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
So sadly Lowkey is not here tonight

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
But filling in for Techmaster Lowkey

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
Say hello to Salacious Pop

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
Hello

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
How are you?

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
I'm great

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
Thank you for coming here on kind of a short notice

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
So, appreciate it

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
No, I live with you now

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
So you can just drag me out wherever

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
Exactly, it's pretty easy

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
I have to be honest, Salacious Pop

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
It wasn't the first person I tried to get on here

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
I know that sounds really horrible

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
It's not, obviously he's a wonderful guest and so forth

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
But it's kind of like, you know, you try to bring on

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
A variety of folks

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
And unfortunately everybody else I asked

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
Was like, ah, Easter

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
And I got Easter stuff going on

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
Yeah, there's Easter things

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
It's like a big holiday or something

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
No, I guess it is for a lot of people

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
But I always thought Easter was kind of done in the morning

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
Like, I finished Easter stuff in the morning today

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
I had family stuff going on

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
But that was all in the morning, so

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
I don't know

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
Well, I mean, I think the real Easter experience is

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
You get up and you go to church

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
So, if you're not going to mass, then

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
Yeah, but

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
You can make it up as you go along

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
Mass is like at midnight or something, right?

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
So, you got plenty of time for OLR still, right?

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
No, I don't know

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
Alright, forget it

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
I'll quit being a heathen or whatever

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
Anyway, let's introduce the chat room

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
They're always there

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
Because really, Jesus died so you could have chocolate

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
chat.orangelaungeradio.com

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
Marshmallow Peeps

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
Eww

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
A chat.orangelaungeradio.com

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
You can chat live with us

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
here on tonight's program

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
And get your little piece in

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
Whatever it is you want to say and so forth

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
We do have a handful of people in chat

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
Despite the holiday

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
Of course, it's a little less than usual

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
And in part, you can blame a week off

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
Because, I'll tell you what

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
Hoard House inadvertently had a week off as well

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
And I'll tell you what, died

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
Forums died

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
It's like, if you do a podcast

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
I'll tell you what, here's the advice

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
Because we get emails once in a while

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
You know, how have you guys stuck with doing a podcast

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
For nine years to today?

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
Do you have any advice?

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
You have my advice?

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
Try never to take weeks off

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
Unless you absolutely have to

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
Because, unfortunately, folks will get out of the habit of listening to you

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
And it's over like that

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
Alright, anyhow, we're back

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
Hopefully you will find room for us

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
In your podcasting and listening schedule again

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
And we want to talk about video games

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
Gaming news

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
We'll start it off as we always do with our gaming week

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
I played a bunch of stuff

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
Well, I played a lot of World of Warcraft

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
And two new games appeared in my steam account today

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
The Star Trek DAC

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
And Darwinia

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
Which I have installed

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
Just have not played

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
Because I had an epic nap today

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
How could that have happened?

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
I don't know, Rob

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
Some Sky person sent it to me

04:35.000 --> 04:39.000
And we had our Final Fantasy go on

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
It's not like you had a birthday or anything happen during the hiatus

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
By the way, happy birthday

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
Thank you

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
Old lady

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
Not old lady

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
Just kidding

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
I still got it

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
Well, Tuesday we went to Dave and Buster's for my birthday

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
Thank you guys for coming

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
You're welcome

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
And I had a purple people eater

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
Which I kind of regretted having

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
Because that was when my stomach was starting to get really bad

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
But, um, we, uh

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
I played some Derby Owners Club

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
And Tank Tank Tank

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
And some of that really awesome Terminator gun game

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
And this weird trivia game

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
That I really didn't know much of the answers to

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
Because it was like sports

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
And pop culture

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
Like, the type of pop culture that I don't keep up with

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
And, uh

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
What else did I play?

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
Because I played other stuff

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
I played Droplets

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
When I had my big bad insomnia attack last night

05:33.000 --> 05:37.000
Except all it really did was make me have to pee

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
And, uh

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
Some, uh, Luminesse

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
And, uh

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
What else did I play?

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
I played something else

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
Oh, yeah, um, Peggle Extreme

05:49.000 --> 05:52.000
And then watched an entire playthrough of Portal 2

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
You actually watched the whole thing start to finish, huh?

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
Yes, I did

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
Wow

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
See, I didn't want to ruin it for myself

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
I did that with the last one, too

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
Did you really?

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
That means now I'll have some idea

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
So how to play a little bit more seamlessly

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
So that I do not get too motion sick

06:07.000 --> 06:12.000
So, um, do you find that if you kind of play the YouTubes in advance or whatever

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
That it helps the experience or hurts it?

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
I think it helps it

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
I've been trying very hard to dodge spoilers

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
I have not beaten Portal 2 yet

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
And I'm really, like, everybody's like

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
You gotta hear the song

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
I'm like, doesn't the song have spoilers?

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
So

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
Not really

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
I mean, yeah, it does really give away the ending

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
But I'm trying really hard to avoid all that, so

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
You know

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
Yeah

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
But I love it

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
My favorite thing so far is

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
BIRD KILL IT

06:41.000 --> 06:45.000
So, uh, do you know that it's Noble Garden Week in WoW?

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
Because you played some WoW, it's Easter

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
Oh

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
It's Easter holiday, it's one of the easier ones

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
I didn't do that, I'll have to do it this week

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
It's all this week, it just started today

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
Okay

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
It's Rob's favorite holiday

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
Ugh

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
No, my favorite holiday is coming up next week in WoW

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
It's Children's Week

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
And my favorite, I mean, ugh

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
It's terrible

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
And it's the one holiday I need for my Violet Drake

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
Because literally last year I said

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
Fuck Children's Week, I'm not putting up with this bullshit

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
Ugh, you gotta do it

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
And I had to wait an entire year

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
Anyhow

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
Well, let's

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
I found, by the way, a dragon that I want

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
That's blue and has transparent wings, looks kind of aquatic

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
It might be one of those hard to get ones

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
I know, but I want it

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
Alright

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
It will be mine

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
Let's move on with some other video games

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
Salacious Pop, what'd you play this week?

07:31.000 --> 07:37.000
I've actually played a lot, considering that usually my schedule is simply WoW

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
Which I'm playing far less of

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
I played some Toki Tori

07:41.000 --> 07:45.000
Because it was a part of the Steam Potato Bag special

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
I had already owned Toki Tori

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
So they just patched in the Potato Portal 2 content

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
Because I wanted to try and unlock Portal 2 early

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
Even though I didn't really have the means to buy it

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
I still haven't really played Portal 2 yet

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
So Toki Tori Mortal Kombat

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
Beat the story mode

08:02.000 --> 08:09.000
And did some just regular one person versus PC fighting on that

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
And some Smash TV

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
Some Fatal

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
Going old school, what made you do Smash TV?

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
Just when we were

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
I was putting my Xbox Live account on your Xbox

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
And was trying to sync up all the games that you have on it

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
So I was just going through some old stuff on there

08:26.000 --> 08:32.000
And yeah, that's it really

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
What did you think of Mortal Kombat?

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
I wish the story mode was longer

08:37.000 --> 08:41.000
Because all the endless fighting

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
If there's even just a little bit of dialogue in between

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
It'll hold my attention more

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
Than just doing ladder mode

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
And getting up to the boss

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
And starting all over from scratch

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
But yeah, I liked it

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
I found a lot of bugs in it

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
Audio bugs

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
That hopefully they'll be able to patch and fix

08:58.000 --> 09:02.000
Once a certain system is back online

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
Which we'll get into I'm sure in a minute

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
But yeah, it's fun

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
It's a good

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
They pretty much looked at what Street Fighter 4 did

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
And it's like, oh that's awesome

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
We should do that for our franchise

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
And it's working for them

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
It doesn't hurt that they've had a little bit of a break

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
With Midway having gone under

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
And somebody else had to pick up the series

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
So it kind of gave them a little time to think about how to reinvent

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
Yeah, I think Warner Brothers

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
I know Warner Brothers published it

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
Well the Mortal Kombat folks I think broke off

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
And made this NetherRealm Studios

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
Is their new little thing

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
And then Warner Brothers is their publisher

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
So you know, Mortal Kombat's

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
Been a viable enough franchise

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
I don't know how well the last few games in the series have sold

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
Keep in mind the last game that came out

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
Was the Mortal Kombat in DC Universe game

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
I don't know how well that sold

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
But before that they were

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
Cranking them out

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
I think those games have always sold enough

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
I don't know if they've ever sold big

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
And it really seems like they're trying to get this new one

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
In the series to sell big

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
Because we had what?

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
We had Deadly Alliance

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
We had Annihilation

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
There was another one in the middle there

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
The one that had the Mortal Kombat mini racing

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
Kart game was there too

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
Annihilation was the one that had

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
Literally everybody

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
That was kind of the last Mortal Kombat game

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
But then they're like, oh

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
How do you save a franchise? You do a reboot

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
And you know, that's literally what they've done

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
Literally, like that's the story

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
Is built around a reboot

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
Yeah, the story mode

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
If you play it from start to finish

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
Does the canon

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
The official canon of the first three games

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
And it sets you up for what

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
Mortal Kombat 4 was, lore wise

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
At the end of the story mode

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
Let's go to our chatroom

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
At chat.orangesonstrader.com for some comments

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
Tigerclaw in our chatroom says

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
The MK story mode is long if you take into account

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
How difficult it was to beat Shao Kahn

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
The best strategy was to

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
Teleport, uppercut, repeat that and stay

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
Far away until time expires

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
Yeah, I did some lightning ball cheese on him

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
Just get away, pew pew

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
I'm gonna pew pew at you

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
And then he just hopefully doesn't block enough of him to win

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
Because the thing about story mode is that you have

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
To play as pretty much every character

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
Or do you play every character?

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
Only the human side really

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
You don't play the outworld

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
And netherworld people

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
But you still have to play a pretty good mix of people

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
Yeah, Sonya, Jax

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
Most of Raiden's little groupies

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
Are who you control

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
And Tigerclaw in our chatroom also fills in here with

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
Rob, it's like what they did with Star Trek

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
Due to the events of the beginning

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
It creates an alternate timeline

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
I don't think that's very spoilery

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
I think that's pretty common knowledge

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
In story mode, I believe people die

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
I haven't gotten that far in my story mode

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
But I believe people do die

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
I don't want to spoil that for you

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
But there's big twists and events

11:52.000 --> 11:56.000
I believe characters become characters that didn't exist before

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
Kind of interesting

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
Back in the 90s when MK2 and MK3 were out

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
Baraka wasn't in MK3

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
Because in the canon

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
He died at the end of 2

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
They don't show that and obviously you can still play as him

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
In this new reboot

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
So they left out some of the deaths

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
So the official canon is in there

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
That's cool

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
Going into my gaming week

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
Obviously I played Mortal Kombat

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
Pretty extensively this week as well

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
I do like how they have

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
Really brought a lot of the nostalgia

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
I think you commenting

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
What Street Fighter 2 did

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
We should do that

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
Or Street Fighter 4 did for Street Fighter 2

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
We should do that

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
Is almost exactly what they've done

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
A lot of that has the nostalgia of the different stages

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
And I really like how in story mode

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
The very first part of story mode

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
Takes place in a stage

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
That you see in the original Mortal Kombat

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
With Shang Tsung sitting up on the throne

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
And all the monks sitting in front of him

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
That applaud

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
They literally bring that to life

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
In this new Mortal Kombat game

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
And that's pretty cool to watch

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
That's something I don't really remember happening in Street Fighter

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
So kind of getting to see all that play out

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
With, I hate saying next gen graphics

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
But you know

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
Or ten years later technology

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
Updated

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
Graphics and effects is really cool

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
Kind of watch all that play out

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
Did you bring it?

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
I didn't bring it tonight

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
I'm sorry I didn't know you wanted to play it

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
I've been watching all of the fatalities

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
And the special unlock characters and everything

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
And I found out where all of the hidden coins are

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
Yeah there's a little guide online

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
That we use to get every costume

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
If you don't

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
Buy any of the extras

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
In the crypt and you just do story mode

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
From start to finish

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
You have 130,000

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
Of the MK coins

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
That's enough to get almost half of the goodies

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
It's enough to get all the costumes and the fatalities

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
That's cool because I think that there's like

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
Another hidden 20,000

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
Yeah

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
I'm being corrected by our chat room

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
Annihilation was the movie

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
Armageddon was the game

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
My bad, my bad, sorry guys

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
Thanks Spaznator

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
A comment from Randy in our chat room

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
I felt like the story mode cleared up the events of the franchise

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
It was definitely more confusing before

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
Yeah you know Mortal Kombat

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
Kind of always felt like one of those games

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
Where they had to kind of write the story

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
To fit what they wanted to do

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
And so there were all these weird things going on

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
But yeah I kind of agree

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
That what they've done with this little reboot

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
I mean granted although they're changing some things

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
It kind of makes a lot of stuff make more sense

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
All in all as far as for the game itself

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
And this is interesting because

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
When I did the demo a couple weeks ago

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
I think I expressed concern

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
Like I'm not sure I'm going to like this game

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
Well just goes to show

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
Don't ever base your opinion of a game off the demo

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
Don't ever ever ever do that

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
Because it was actually really good

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
And I've been having a good time with it

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
I think there's such a great variety in characters

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
That they've brought in

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
Pretty much every single fighter from 1, 2, and 3

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
Are in it right

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
With maybe some very minor like the boss characters

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
Not all of them are there

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
When I was going through the list I saw that

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
Kentaro, Goro

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
Shiva

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
I think they all show up in the story

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
But they had fatalities for him

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
Oh really?

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
The big centaur dude with the big horse

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
I think he was the boss of MK3

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
He's in it in a cutscene but you don't play as him

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
And then Quan Chi from before

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
Was brought in so he's playable

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
But otherwise the people from 4 aren't in it yet

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
Yeah although

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
DLC might change some of that

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
There's a character that was introduced in Deadly Alliance

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
Who's actually one of my favorite characters

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
Kenshi is one of the first download characters

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
The blind ninja guy

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
There's a lot of people calling for Tanya to show up

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
I would love Tanya to be in the game

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
She's awesome

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
She wasn't a major character though

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
She was a bitch

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
So I'm not expecting her to show up

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
But it would be cool if she would

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
And then I was watching the fatalities

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
For Kratos

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
Kratos is in the game

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
He obviously fits right in

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
I gotta say though

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
He plays like any other character

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
Which I think is a compliment

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
You don't want a character like Kratos

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
To be gimmicky or stick out like a sore thumb

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
But I mean the whole

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
Painting his body white and everything

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
Well Quan Chi does that shit too

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
So he kind of fits right in with everybody else

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
It's a better promotional exclusive thing

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
Than I don't know Darth Vader and Yoda

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
And Soul Calibur IV

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
And also the other thing

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
That

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
Who was it?

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
I just lost my train of thought

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
It was somebody else that's in there

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
Well Noob and

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
Ermac were

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
Fandom rumors

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
That they actually made real characters

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
I love that

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
Ermac's fatality with the spikes

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
That one's really cool

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
Leo Shen is in our chat room saying

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
No Rain otherwise they would have all of Trilogy

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
Yeah Rain is one of the most notable

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
Notable characters that's missing but

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
To be honest because they've done so

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
Much with the other ninjas like

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
Cyrax and Sektor are not

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
Just palette swaps

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
They are fully developed

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
They start in story mode as humans

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
And you can unlock their human forms

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
So they are all very different characters

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
So I can see why they probably cut

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
Rain because while he was a cool

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
Character especially he was really

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
Tacked into Trilogy I think

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
He was purple Rain

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
He was a palette swap that had a couple cool moves

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
With a neat name

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
Otherwise he was really

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
Forced in the story

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
I would bet he's DLC later on though

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
I remember what I was going to say

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
One of Shang Tsung's fatalities was actually

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
His mortal combat

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
Versus DC fatality

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
Except it's the whole thing

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
Because they cut it to where you only see him

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
Turn into a clown

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
And then you don't see the other person explode

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
They showed the full fatality

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
Because people were like what happened

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
So they actually put that in there

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
The fatalities in this game are a little silly

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
As they're supposed to be very over the top

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
Babalities are in there

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
Babalities are cute

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
But friendships are not which kind of surprised me

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
I was very sad

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
No animalities or any of the other weird stuff either

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
I was really sad friendships weren't there

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
I always loved those in Mortal Combat 2

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
Otherwise the game is pretty fast paced

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
It's got a great tutorial mode

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
That kind of teaches you how to do things like

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
The x-ray attacks are a really neat addition

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
It does feel a little lifted

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
From Street Fighter 4

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
It's one of those things where it's like

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
It's not a copy

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
But it's definitely influenced

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
But it's really cool

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
It adds to the battle exactly what it does

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
In Street Fighter 4

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
If you are behind this gives you a chance to level the playing field

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
If your opponent has a moment of weakness

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
And the x-ray attacks look really cool

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
And it makes the battle flow really well

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
And I think that's where this game really shines

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
Is that just the battles

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
Flow so well

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
They're fun to play

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
The fatalities give that

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
Sense of edge to it

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
There's a lot at stake

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
Where this Mortal Combat

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
Really shines is where a lot of the

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
Prior Mortal Combat games have really shined

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
And that is the

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
Robustness of what is offered

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
In the title

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
You've got your story mode

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
You've got your challenge ladder

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
You've got the crypt thing

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
Which the crypt thing has been done better

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
In other versions of the game I think

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
But whatever it's still there

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
You have different modes to play

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
And the tag team thing

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
Kind of comes out of nowhere too

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
They kind of took that whole idea

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
I guess you could say Marvel vs Capcom or whatever

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
But now you have teams of two

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
And you can do assists and all that stuff

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
So it's pretty cool

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
Mortal Combat has really been invigorated

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
It's been infused with some of the best parts

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
For a pretty awesome experience

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
One of my favorite Mortal Combat games in recent memory

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
The best one of all time

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
I think that's still two

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
It's one of those that

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
That's going to be hard to top

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
It's worth

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
Checking out if nothing else

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
A lot of people like to point and laugh at Mortal Combat

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
In the fighting world

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
But I think this one shows that there's a lot here to take seriously

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
Two Beta was great

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
With Katana's infinite combo

20:06.000 --> 20:10.000
Let's see

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
Tigerclaw in our chatroom says

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
Rob regarding animalities at least one of them is in there

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
It's one of Liu Kang's fatalities

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
That's true

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
But wasn't it also a fatality in Mortal Combat 2

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
I think that's what inspired it

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
Not necessarily the animalities

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
Anyhow, other games I played this week

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
I don't want to talk just about Mortal Combat

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
Because I haven't had a chance to play Mortal Combat online

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
Because of certain outages

20:32.000 --> 20:36.000
But I have had a chance to check out Portal 2

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
Portal 2 is

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
I played the first game

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
And played that game pretty extensively

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
And it was always a pretty cool concept

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
And when I heard they were making a sequel

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
I knew it was going to be pretty interesting

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
And I've been playing through the single player mode

20:50.000 --> 20:54.000
And I really don't know what to say

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
I honestly think

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
Games like

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
Super Mario Brothers

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
Final Fantasy 7

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
Games that have been

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
Landmark for that generation

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
I honestly think Portal 2 fits into that

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
For this generation

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
I think this is like a

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
Legendary status of a game

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
Honestly

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
It really just took the first one

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
And it's like, wow, people kind of like this idea

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
And this concept

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
We're just going to, again, infuse all this new stuff into it

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
And it's just given it all this energy

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
And now a story that's really taken off on its own

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
And all these different concepts

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
I mean, I really think

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
This game is going to just stand the test of time

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
As this is really a great game

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
That's really easy to get into

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
It's a first person shooter for people who hate first person shooters

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
That's one of the

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
Really interesting things about it

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
And the story is well done, the voice acting is

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
Phenomenal

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
And then there's a co-op mode on top of all of that

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
And I think it's just

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
A great game

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
I really try to keep myself spoiler free

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
And I've been very happy with some of the twists and turns

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
That the story has been taking

22:00.000 --> 22:04.000
I was really expecting it to just be

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
Kind of a continuation of Portal 1

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
Where you would just have more test chambers

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
And explore the story a little more

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
But there's much more here

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
Than just more test chambers

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
And that's all I'm really going to say

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
Although there are a lot of those

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
There are a lot of those

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
But there's much more

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
This game digs beneath the surface

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
And I don't just mean beneath the surface

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
Of the test chambers

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
Which you do get to see as well

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
Which is really cool

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
GLaDOS as a character

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
Is legendary

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
Where are you right now?

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
In the world of video games

22:40.000 --> 22:44.000
I have done the blue repulsion gel

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
A couple times

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
So you've seen Potato?

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
I have seen Potato

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
Okay, I'm trying to figure out where you are

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
So I get where the Potato Sack joke comes from now

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
That didn't occur to me until later

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
But yes, so I get where that all comes from

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
My favorite still is

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
BIRD KILL IT

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
So yeah

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
And I have to say I was reading on a few things

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
And you know where you see

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
All the old potatoes

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
The bring your daughter to work

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
Day science fair

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
The big mutated potato

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
Is supposed to be Shell's project

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
Interesting

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
Interesting

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
Alright

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
So anyway

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
Some comments in our chat room

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
Randy in our chat room says

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
Watching Portal for the first time made me think

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
How does someone have the mental capacity to figure out these puzzles

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
You know a lot of it is trial and error

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
I noticed that the second game

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
Really limits where you can put portals

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
More than the first game did

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
And that's part of the puzzles

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
They've added all this other stuff into it

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
Like the lasers

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
The gel is a huge thing

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
I got stuck on one puzzle

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
Because of that stupid gel

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
I couldn't figure out how to

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
I didn't figure out that you could actually make gel

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
Fly through the walls that destroy things

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
Otherwise I would have figured it out a lot sooner

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
And just crazy stuff

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
You really have to look around for surfaces

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
That could be a mile high up

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
For you to fling a portal onto

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
It is really an experience

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
To play a game like Portal

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
And I really don't know what else to say

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
The game is outstanding

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
And it's well worth your money

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
If you haven't bought it yet

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
I guess you already know this is probably the type of game

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
That maybe just isn't for you for whatever reason

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
Or you know obviously economical whatever stuff

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
60 bucks is still a huge investment

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
But I don't know what else to say

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
I think most people who want it

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
Already went and got it first day

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
The Steam integration is great

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
I was really surprised at how well

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
Steam integrates with the Playstation 3

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
But you can hit select

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
And it's just like being logged into Steam

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
I don't know what else to say

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
It was pretty seamless

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
You connect your Playstation network account

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
To Steam

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
And then that's it

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
You can hit select and I can see all my Steam friends

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
And who's on

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
And it's just like I'm playing another Steam game

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
But it's on my Playstation 3

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
Now I was wondering

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
If someone picked this up

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
They wouldn't be able to get the Steam

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
Link would they?

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
There is a card

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
That comes with the game

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
That has the code on it

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
So sadly no you wouldn't be able to get it

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
You'd have to buy it new in order to get to both games

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
And it says somehow

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
It says on the back of the box

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
You cannot play co-op

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
On your PC and PS3

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
But I don't know

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
See I haven't really explored that yet

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
Maybe somebody in our chat knows

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
And I would imagine a lot of that is because of the Steam hookup

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
If I log into Steam on my PS3

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
It's not going to let me do it on my PC as well

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
To play the same game

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
But what would happen if I have two

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
Playstation 3 accounts

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
Like for example, Salacious Pop uses my Playstation

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
3 as well

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
What if he connected that to his Steam

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
And then played on my PS3

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
And then I played Steam on my computer

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
Maybe that would work? I don't know

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
Because I can't imagine that the discs are imprinted with the serial numbers somehow

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
So unless

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
Hooking up Steam

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
And hooking up the whole console

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
To that Steam ID

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
I would think you could have that

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
I don't know

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
I'm going to be honest

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
I haven't even really played it on Steam

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
I've been completely satiated with the PS3 version

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
I don't really need the Steam version

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
It's nice to have

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
It's a cool little bonus

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
But I didn't really need it

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
I'm waiting until I can play it on PC

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
Because I'm like that

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
I need the mouse in WASD

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
It really is a lot easier to play on the PC

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
See but see

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
This all goes back to joystick vs mouse and keyboard

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
Some people prefer mouse and keyboard

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
I love the DualShock controller

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
For playing it, it's awesome

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
Great for me

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
Spazzinator in our chat room says

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
Is the cake still a lie in Portal 2?

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
No

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
There is one joke that is

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
Blink and you miss it sort of thing

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
And I like that they did that

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
Because they didn't try to keep the same joke

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
Going through the whole thing

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
I really like that

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
Glados has some new insults and some of them are real good

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
She consistently makes fat jokes about you

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
Which are just outstanding

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
I love the Glados cut downs

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
Some of them are really harsh

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
All I'll say

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
The surprise?

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
When the confetti blows

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
I was dying

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
Alright

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
Next time there will be real confetti

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
Let's see

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
Go into our chatroom at chat.orangelaungeradio.com

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
Let's see

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
Bonds006 says

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
Like the Xbox 360 recovery game tag ability?

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
From Sony?

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
No Rob, stop hoping

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
I don't think that's exactly what I'm talking about

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
Although, yeah it is a little weird

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
That you can

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
You have to

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
We're having this problem now that

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
We have two Xbox 360's in our house

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
If we put the live on one

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
We have to migrate the account to play on the other

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
Xbox every time

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
It's a little irritating

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
It's weird

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
Frisbee in our chatroom says

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
The console versions should let you use keyboard and mouse

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
That would be kind of nice

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
You can hook up the USB stuff and then use that

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
That would be nice

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
I guess maybe that's why they give you the PC one free

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
I don't know

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
Other games I've played this week

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
It doesn't stop there

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
Those are the two big ones

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
I bought a 3DS

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
Chapter 4 on the 3DS

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
I didn't realize

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
Every single freaking fighter

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
From the original

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
Is in the 3DS version

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
That's pretty impressive that they have all that

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
Obviously the graphics have been scaled down a little bit

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
To make it all fit

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
But it's 3D

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
And there's this cool little mode where you can actually play

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
Over the shoulder of one of the characters

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
That it's very 3D

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
Kind of neat

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
All the little modes that they put in that

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
Loki kind of reviewed the title on the show before

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
So I'm not going to rehash everything

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
But I do like that they've put in a street pass feature

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
Where you can fight things

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
It gives you incentive to keep playing

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
So you can collect these little trophies

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
Different from achievements

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
But the little trophies are what you use in street pass mode

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
To help fight other people and so forth

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
And 3DS is a system

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
I'm liking it so far

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
I feel like there's so much more potential there

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
That we're going to unlock in May

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
When they do some of the patches

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
There's a lot in the interface

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
Where you hit the button and it says

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
This feature is not yet available

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
It will be installed through a system update

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
But otherwise the online is much easier on this

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
Than it has been on other systems

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
I couldn't tell you how much

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
I shouldn't say the word impressed

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
But the first time I went into the menu

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
Where I could just see all my friends

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
And if they're online or not and what they're playing

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
The reaction I had of

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
It's about freaking time Nintendo

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
It's still code based

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
It's still code based

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
But it's supposedly one code

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
For everything which is nice

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
And I had some issues

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
With the facial recognition

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
It'll make your little

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
Me avatar

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
You take a picture of yourself

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
You square your head

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
In the frame

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
And it thinks that I have

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
Really huge jowls

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
My head looked like a bell

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
My 3DS is apparently

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
GLaDOS because it was calling you fat

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
I think it was

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
I'm rocking a beard right now

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
And I think it just thought that my

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
Facial hair was face

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
So it's like, yeah

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
Well the good news is if you don't like the me that it gives you

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
You can go in and tweak it

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
And I'll tell you what, the first time you take a picture

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
And have it do a me based on your picture

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
You're not gonna like what comes out

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
I'm just convinced nobody's gonna like the thing that comes out

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
It's the new technological advance

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
Of the driver's license photo

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
Where you get

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
It in the mail and you're like, oh was I sick

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
That day?

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
Exactly, that's a very good way of putting it

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
Alright, so gosh

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
I think I've covered about everything

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
I have Final Fantasy IV, the complete edition

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
On order as well

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
I was frugal in my shopping and I went on Amazon.com

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
And bought Mortal Kombat

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
And Portal 2

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
I got like $20 credit for buying one

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
And $10 credit for buying the other

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
I usually don't give shout outs to retail chains

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
Or anything like that

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
Because we're a commercial free show

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
But I just gotta say as a gamer, I was pretty impressed

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
They only charged me $4 for shipping

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
They had the games there on release day

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
I got $30 worth of free credit

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
Which I used to buy the Final Fantasy IV complete collection

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
Which was the other game I wanted this week

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
So, win!

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
Hey, I'm all for good deals, exactly

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
Alright

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
Let's see, going to our chatroom again

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
Chat.orangeloungeradio.com

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
Bonds006 in our chat agrees

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
It does make you look not like yourself

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
Tigerclaw says

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
Regarding the Streetpass, so far it's been working

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
I go about 4 miles from Streetpass

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
But the fine me still

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
Oh, I don't know

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
Oh, I think I got about 4 me's

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
From Streetpass, but the fine me

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
Still won't let me use them

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
How many Streetpass me's do you need in order

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
For fine me to work without buying the heroes?

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
Good question, I haven't figured that out yet

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
I just got the 3DS last night

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
So I have yet to run into people

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
Or run into the mall or anything

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
Or a place where other gamers are

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
Where I've had Streetpass

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
I've just bought the me's

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
And what I mean by that, the 3DS has a built in game

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
Called fine me

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
And it's a little chibi role playing game

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
Like very bare bones

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
Like fight, magic, run type of thing

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
Very bare bones

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
And you can use coins that you get from the pedometer

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
The pedometer is built into the 3DS

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
And every time you're in sleep mode

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
Every time you take 100 steps

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
You get a maximum 10 coins a day

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
So it's pretty cool because it's encouraging people to go out and walk

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
Or shake their DS repeatedly to get the steps

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
It's kind of like that

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
Walking trainer game that came out

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
For the DSi a couple

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
Years ago

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
It's been actually built into the 3DS

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
And you get coins for doing it

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
And you can buy heroes

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
And as you play through this role playing mode

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
You unlock hats for your me's

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
Like the very first thing you get is a little Mario hat

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
That you can put on your me

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
For your me

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
So if you want to be a little kitty

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
That sounds awesome

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
Alright so

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
Let's move on

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
Oh BlackWolf in our chatroom says

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
I got one me and I used him on fine me

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
So I guess maybe there's

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
Something that Tigerclaw missed in that

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
I don't know

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
Yeah I gotta try and get more me's

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
I was hoping Loki would be here so we could street past the DS's

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
But oh well

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
Easter's more important I suppose

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
We're going to move into some gaming news

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
But first some quick plugs for where you can find us

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
Around the internet we are on Twitter

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
Twitter.com slash OLR

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
As well as Facebook, facebook.com

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
Slash orange lounge radio

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
And of course once again we do tape live

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
At All Games Radio www.allgames.com

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
If you've never joined us for a live show

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
Why not?

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
You should sometime at some point

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
Alright let's get into tonight's gaming news

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
Pop's going to start us off tonight since he's filling in for Loki

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
This is a huge story that's been

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
Covered most major avenues

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
For gaming news and that is

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
The fact that on Wednesday night

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
The Playstation Network

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
Went down like a drunk

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
Bicurious frat boy at a Jack Jansen concert

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
It's just gone

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
That's yeah

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
Wednesday night

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
No PSN, no store

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
No

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
Curiosity

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
Store or anything like that

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
And Sony confirmed that it was

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
Because of an external intrusion

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
Which means they got

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
Text

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
Someone got into the system

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
In a bad way and brought

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
The whole thing down and I guess

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
Given the statement that

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
Cybold

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
Put out

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
It sounds like they're completely

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
Rebuilding their

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
The OS or

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
Whatever the security patch was so bad

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
That they're willing to take down their entire

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
Store for five days now

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
Nearly

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
And what a shitty time for this to happen

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
I mean you know this is the

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
Week to have a Playstation 3 of all

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
Weeks you know Mortal Kombat

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
Has the slight edge having one more

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
Character on the PS3 and let's face it a better

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
Controller sorry

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
And Portal 2 obviously

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
You know they

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
Gabe Newell got up there at

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
E3 and said

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
K my bad on Playstation my bad guys

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
It's actually going to be the system you're going to want to

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
Own Portal 2 on remember that

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
And obviously with the Steam integration

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
It's pretty great and so

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
I kind of wonder how that plays into it like

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
Maybe just the fact that now all of a sudden

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
All these folks who maybe own both

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
Systems were like opting for the PS3

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
Versions in conjunction with whatever

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
Else is going on behind the scenes it brought it

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
Down

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
Yeah I'm sure you know there are people at Valve that

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
I don't want to say they're you know

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
Pissed but it's there

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
It's a huge release for Valve and

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
The

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
Authoritative console version

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
You can't do co-op on it right now because

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
Of Sony so I'm sure they've got all these

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
Developers not just Valve breathing down their neck

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
Going how did this happen you know

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
Consumers are worried that

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
If the hack was

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
You know this bad that it would bring down their

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
Entire network for five days

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
Did they have access to customer records

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
Because a lot of people have their credit cards saved

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
Because they like just the one click purchase

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
I gotta admit that makes me

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
Very nervous because

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
Yeah alright mine's on there and I'm a

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
Little worried about this because

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
You know if that

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
Information got out I want to know

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
Like and I need Sony to be communicating

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
A little better than like yeah we're down

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
Because we got hacked no shit

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
Like we all read the internet

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
Even CNN was reporting about how

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
Anonymous was attacking Playstation Network

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
And whether they're responsible for this or not

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
I mean Sony has an obligation

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
To tell me exactly

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
What information of mine is out there

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
California has some pretty strict consumer rights

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
Laws involving

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
Statements made about their information

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
I think the federal government has some pretty strict laws on that

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
Stuff it's not just California many states

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
Do you know but uh

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
Yeah I mean obviously but the

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
Bummer is I think

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
You can report up to

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
90 days after the incident

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
And I'm sorry Sony I want to know now

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
Like stop giving all this fluff

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
What exactly is happening

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
We're going on 4 to 5 days now

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
You know and

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
You know we kind of joke

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
About how on this show like a lot of times

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
The system will go down for a day or two

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
And it's always like nobody ever remembers

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
Nobody ever remembers that

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
Xbox went down right after Halo 3

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
Came out too you know

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
Gamers pretty much overlook this stuff

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
Because once it's fixed then they can play their games

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
But this is starting to go on one of those

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
Things where it's getting harder and harder

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
To say you're just going to easily forget this

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
Especially if we find out

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
That our information was at risk

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
That is going to be a huge

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
Huge

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
Smack in the face of digital distribution

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
Is the new model and GameStop

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
Will buy breathe a huge sigh of relief

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
Because they'll be open that much longer

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
I think with the Xbox

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
They've had the gold which is

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
The 4 pay platform you know

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
For Xbox Live that's been around

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
Longer more people depend on that for the

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
Co-op playing for Netflix

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
Whereas the PSN you know

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
You post your trophies and you do some matching service

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
On it but PSN

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
Because it doesn't have I mean if you don't buy

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
The download games

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
From PSN there's really no reason

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
For them to have your credit card information

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
Whereas on the Xbox Live service

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
You need a credit card for gold period

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
I actually don't put

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
Any of my information in those if I can

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
Help it because with

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
Xbox you put it in there they will find

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
A way that

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
Even if you unintentionally

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
Press something they're still going to charge you

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
So it's best not to have it in there

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
At all just buy the points through

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
The internet for the PlayStation Network

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
What I would do is I would I don't know if you can

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
Do this anymore but I would go onto the site

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
The website PlayStation Network put

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
Some money in my bucket or whatever

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
Then buy the game through the PS3

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
That way I can do a one-time transaction

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
And they don't have my credit card saved in there

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
Because otherwise I don't trust it well this might

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
Be one of those tough lessons learned I mean granted

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
I have a pretty good bank who you know

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
Isn't gonna you know if I were to something bad were

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
To happen they're not gonna hold me liable for it

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
But it the whole thing will just piss me off more

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
It'll piss me off more

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
Whoever hacked this thing which now

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
We can't figure out if it was anonymous or not

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
And this is

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
Really interesting because this just pulls

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
Back this whole other layer of

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
What is anonymous all about

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
Because because of the fact that they don't

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
Have a face they are anonymous

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
So to speak it is so easy

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
For the media to blame them for this

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
Which is what's happening they may not be responsible

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
But they're getting the blame for this because

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
There's no one to defend anonymous because they're anonymous

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
And that adds actually to their notoriety

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
Yeah as I understand it

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
They're probably eating it up

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
As I understand it a couple weeks ago when the

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
The GeoHats verdict came down

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
They did a couple days of DDOS attacks

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
Which is where they flood the system with requests

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
That was it so this thing

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
That just brought you know brought the whole thing down

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
Like a house of cards they're like it's not

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
Whoever the people that

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
Yeah whoever the mouthpiece is whoever is calling

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
The shots which is probably

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
They're like it's not us we did our shit three weeks ago

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
Well and also the reason why they

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
Stopped was because they realized

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
They were putting the consumers at risk and that's not

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
What they wanted to do so I actually

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
When you mention that you know

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
They're getting more notoriety

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
I actually this isn't the notoriety

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
That they want they don't want to be responsible for the

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
Consumers because that's who they were trying to defend

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
In the first place so this whole GeoHats thing

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
But unfortunately how easy

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
Is it for the not

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
As tech savvy media mainstream

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
Media to just say well it's

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
Anonymous' fault you know they said they were gonna

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
They put out these videos and Anonymous Anonymous Anonymous

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
Anonymous I mean maybe they like having their name

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
Out there but I don't necessarily think this is

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
What they wanted their name on but because

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
Anonymous has no mouthpiece

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
This could be a whole

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
Subset of the group that's doing

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
This and we just don't know

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
It's interesting

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
That whole

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
Politics or whatever you want to call it behind

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
It is fascinating

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
And just to get to the meat and potatoes of this story

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
Patrick Sebold who is the head

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
Of PR for Sony this is his actual

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
Statement on it

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
Quote an external

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
Intrusion on our system has affected

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
Our Playstation network and

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
Curiosity services in order to

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
Conduct a thorough investigation and

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
To verify the smooth and secure operation

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
Of our network services going forward

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
We turned off Playstation network

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
And Curiosity services on the evening

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
Of Wednesday April 20th

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
Providing quality entertainment services

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
To our customers and partners is our utmost

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
Priority

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
That's their

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
See that's all they got to say about it

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
Part of me is kinda like something really

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
Bad happened this is much

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
More than a DDoS attack

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
Because if that was the case

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
We would not be sitting down talking about

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
Deconstructing the whole fucking thing

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
During Easter weekend

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
Which is the start of

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
Spring break when you have

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
Two of your biggest titles out

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
That is why I'm sitting here going

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
I think private information was

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
Breached and I think it's gonna come out in the next

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
Week that that's what happened

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
And that kinda worries me

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
Like otherwise your timing

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
Is just ridiculous Sony

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
As someone with a

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
Sales analyst background

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
The fact that their store

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
Is offline

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
Like oh yeah that's no revenue for a week

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
That's you know

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
Even a company as big as Sony that makes

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
You know billions of dollars a year

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
If you don't make a penny for five days you will feel it

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
So yeah it's pretty serious

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
Alright

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
Well let's move on with some more stories

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
This one kinda came up while we were off last week

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
But it's just speaking of

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
Demons with multiple heads or whatever you want to call it

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
This is a story that's just been going on and on

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
Over the past couple weeks that

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
You know we didn't have a show last week and that is

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
The rumored new

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
Nintendo console. A new Nintendo

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
Console is rumored to be debuting at E3

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
This June

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
Supposedly launching in 2012

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
It's supposed to be you know more powerful

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
Obviously than the Wii

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
A lot of talk about how it's supposed to be scary

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
Similar to the Xbox 360

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
Where if you develop a game for the

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
360 it's supposed to be just that much easier

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
For you to develop for whatever this

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
New Nintendo console is

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
These leaks are coming

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
From Game Informer who I believe

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
Was sorting a French

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
Site in their news which was

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
The same French site that I believe broke

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
The story on the PSP Go

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
So it's kinda one of those things where like

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
If the site was true before they're probably

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
Right again you know

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
Yeah and Game Informer is the face

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
Of GameSpot

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
And did also Forbes run

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
Or was it Wall Street Journal that ran a story on this

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
Like a really very dry

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
It was enough to break to the mainstream

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
Media and that's just making people give this

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
Thought that it's probably

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
True which

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
I'm kind of sad Loki's not

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
Here because I swear to god if you go back

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
In the archives and listen to a show in January

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
I told him I said

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
Nintendo's gonna announce a new console at E3

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
This year and he's like no they're not the Wii's still

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
Printing money I said what do they have coming

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
Out on the Wii there is no

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
Big title on the Wii right now except

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
Zelda that is it

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
And now they've pushed Zelda back

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
What's the real reason Zelda just

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
Got pushed back everybody

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
That game was ready to roll I'll bet you

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
Anything but now it's been pushed back why

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
It's getting the same treatment that the

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
Last Zelda game did

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
Guarantee it

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
And it's gonna be multi

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
Console just like the last one

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
And oh I wanted him to be here so bad

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
So I could point I told you so I told you so

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
But yeah this

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
And honestly I kind of

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
See this as kind of a duh

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
What else did Nintendo have to talk about at E3 this year

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
As far as consoles go

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
I mean I should say

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
Living room consoles go the 3DS

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
Obviously is gonna be the clearly

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
They're gonna roll out the Mario game and the

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
Kid Icarus game and those are gonna be their big titles that are gonna

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
Sell more this year as they talk about

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
Netflix and some of the other multimedia

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
Guaranteed you're gonna see that and whatever

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
Way we can make 9 year olds

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
Wanna have a 3DS they're gonna

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
Try to sell as many of those under the Christmas tree as they can

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
More Pokemans

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
Yeah and the rumor is there's gonna be a Pokemon

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
Announcement at some point as well

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
So I would take that

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
A little closer to Tokyo Game Show but sure

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
That's an inevitable as well

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
Pokemon Plaid and Pokedot

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
Pokemon 3D

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
But as far as you know

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
Living room consoles go it's been dead

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
On Nintendo's front I mean even with the

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
Zelda game if that game

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
Was really coming out like soon

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
We would be flooded with more

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
More uh

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
I don't know screenshots

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
And videos and things of that nature

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
So guarantee it there's a new console in the

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
Works I mean Nintendo has to play

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
Catch up in some regards to this

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
It prints money

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
Well there's even more rumors that um

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
There's even more rumors

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
That follow up with this

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
And some of it has to do with the

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
Controller I suppose it's gonna be

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
With this system

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
Apparently the by the way

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
They're calling this whole thing Project Cafe

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
Which I guess is like you know

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
Dolphin was for the GameCube

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
Right or was that the 64?

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
And then Revolution was the codename for the Wii

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
The Saturn was the Katana I think

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
This will not be called Project Cafe

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
When it comes out guaranteed

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
Yeah the Saturn was Katana but then when they

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
Were doing Pre for Dreamcast it was Neptune

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
That's right

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
They will do some very

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
Weird name that is very

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
One syllable type of easy thing just like

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
You know Wii was they'll do something like that

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
But anyway supposedly the

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
Controller is supposed to be like an iPad

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
With buttons 8 buttons

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
2 analog sticks a camera a

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
6.2 inch touch screen

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
That's kind of weird because that

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
Means the controllers themselves

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
Would cost several hundred dollars

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
If they're as fancy as everyone

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
Thinks they are now see part of me says

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
I don't necessarily think they're as good

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
As an iPad or an iPod

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
Because you know what I think about I've seen these

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
Printers for sale at Fry's

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
That have a removable touch screen type of thing

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
That you can take from the printer

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
And actually look at like the vices

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
And the screen it's okay but it's

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
Kind of cheap I think that

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
Is more what this is going to look like if this is even

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
True because the problem with this is

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
That now that you have these

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
Rumors that look like they're going to be true

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
Everybody's sucking onto

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
It and now once you know you're going to see

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
Fake pictures fake

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
Everybody's going to just have a field day with this

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
I'm just thinking of the VMU now

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
And that's what a lot of people

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
Are saying too

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
That would make sense and I honestly

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
I played little things on my VMU

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
I was trying to raise my

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
Chow

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
In Japanese

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
And the Final Fantasy

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
Oh wait no

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
This is the pocket station too

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
Yeah I totally just switched up

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
That had that really cool thing

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
The integration with the second rival schools

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
Yeah the evolution disc

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
And also

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
Nintendo has kind of

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
Ever since they GameCube

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
They've been the more affordable

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
Family friendly option

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
So they can't go all high tech and put out

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
You know a $600 system because that's

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
Going to go against what their business model

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
Has been for like 7 years now

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
I agree this has to be a cheap

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
System and I don't mean like they could probably

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
Get away with selling it for $300

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
Maybe $400 if it's that fucking good

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
But it's going to have to be cheaper

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
Than like an iPad

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
You know how much was the Wii when it first came out? 250

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
But of course it was supposed to be the budget system

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
It was a steal yeah

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
I honestly don't see them putting out such an expensive

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
Piece of technology as a controller

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
I truly think if this is even true

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
I really think you're looking at something

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
Like those printers

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
Because those printers are only like $300

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
And they have that little device that you take

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
Right off of them

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
I think we're looking at something more like that

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
They're all going to have Game Boy Micros attached to them

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
Well

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
Whatever will help them sell

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
More virtual console games

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
I would think your 3DS

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
Would be the ideal controller for this system

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
If they really want to

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
Have that synergy

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
Like remember back in the day

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
Remember

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
The Advance had the link cable to the GameCube

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
We needed it for Animal Crossing

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
To do the island

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
There were 3 games that used it

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
Animal Crossing, the Pacman

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
Versus, and Zelda

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
Sonic Adventure 2 and the Sonic

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
Advance games

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
The Chao trading

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
And then you can do weird things like unlock original Metroid

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
But I don't consider that a full feature

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
That's just, you know

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
Quick tangent about the Wii real quick

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
It's hooked up now at your place

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
For the first time in like 16 months

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
Yes I did, I hooked up the Wii for the first time in 16 months

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
And what did I play on it?

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
I think Super Metroid, we also hooked up the Super Nintendo

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
I found my bonafide Super Nintendo

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
And we were playing Mortal Kombat

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
Like the real Mortal Kombat

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
That was kind of cool

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
I'm a little distracted right now

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
I don't want to call this breaking news or whatever

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
But I just have to throw this out here because I know Dark Sakura

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
Is going to be interested in this

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
And Mikolatov, if you're listening, which I know you are, you need to post his link in chat

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
Because he's showing me graphics from Phantasy Star

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
Online 2

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
Yeah, my friend Krista posted those images today

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
I guess more information came out on this

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
I have not seen this at all

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
Technically she posted them yesterday from Japan

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
There's more information on 4gamer.net

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
Yeah

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
This looks like Universe

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
Kind of

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
Like in high def and these cool little screens

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
I miss Phantasy Star Online

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
I do too

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
And there was just something missing in Phantasy Star Universe

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
So I hope Sega has figured it out

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
Who am I kidding?

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
I'm going to get that game when it comes out

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
I'm not even going to lie

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
Oh, Ziba reminded me

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles 2

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
For the Game Boy Advance controller

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
That's right

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
I guess there were a few, not just one or two games

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
And Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
Was a pretty cool game too

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
And those were all games

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
That very few people ever really got to experience

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
Because the setup for it was so damn expensive

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
But yeah, the Crystal Chronicles

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
Thing was so cool

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
Alright

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
Anyhow, one other rumor

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
About the new Nintendo system

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
Supposedly, Nintendo is

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
Trying to make nice nice with Rockstar

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
Trying to get them to develop for the Wii 2

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
And

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
This is a report

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
From, what is this, Zero One Net

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
Which I think is also Go Nintendo

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
I don't know, it's all over the internet somewhere

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
Saying that Rockstar

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
Apparently is

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
Being courted for Grand Theft Auto 5

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
To release in, well

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
2012 is supposed to be when Grand Theft Auto 5 comes out

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
And Nintendo is supposedly courting them

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
To release the game on

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
This new Nintendo system as well

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
Which really, it makes sense

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
And it's not like Rockstar hates Nintendo

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
Rockstar put out that mediocre

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
Grand Theft Auto game on the DS

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
Remember, the Chinatown Wars or whatever

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
So it would not be unheard of

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
For Rockstar to develop for the Nintendo console

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
But I think if Nintendo wanted to be serious

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
About the whole, hey

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
We're going back for the hardcore gamer

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
This year

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
Maybe that'll be Reggie Zangle when he takes the E3 stage

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
We've made a gaming console for everybody

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
We've made a gaming console

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
For those that want to play their Wii games on HD

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
We've made a gaming console for kids

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
We've made a gaming console for the hardcore gamer

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
You want proof?

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
We're getting Grand Theft Auto 5

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
Bet you never thought you'd hear me saying that

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
You know that's not going to happen

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
Well, he won't say it like that

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
Oh, I think Grand Theft Auto 5, if the rumors are true

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
About that

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
This is as easy to develop for us

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
With the Xbox 360 and so forth

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
They have that synergy because of the hardware

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
That both systems are using

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
I think this is absolutely true

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
But

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
I think this is also part of fanboy wank

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
It kind of blurs the line

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
I think it's obvious fanboy wank

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
You know how sometimes sites

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
Will report on things that are kind of obvious

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
I think this falls in that category

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
To be honest

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
You know what, I kind of wish

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
That more companies would do

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
One of the things that made the Dreamcast

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
Easy to develop on

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
Is the fact that it would build in a Windows CE

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
Environment

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
And every time a Dreamcast game would load

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
That was built in Windows CE

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
It installed the newest version of Windows CE

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
And then played the game

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
So you always had

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
Your system OS tailored

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
To the game that you were playing

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
Alright, again, going to our chat room

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
At chat.orangeloungeradio.com

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
Is where you want to be

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
Orangeloungeradio.com and click on chat

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
Or on the Game Surge Network

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
On channel Orangelounge

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
Is where you want to be, that's our official chat room

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
Some comments there

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
Saying San in our chat room says

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
Chinatown Wars was not mediocre

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
From what I've heard, I'm just going off Loki

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
Who's like the biggest gramp, that's auto addict I know, sorry

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
DDR Dollar Bill

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
Says Chinatown Wars was just too dark

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
To play, and Randy in our chat room

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
Says Niko Bellic and Nex Super

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
Smash Brothers

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
Now that

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
That could be an interesting set of talks

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
You know what, going with

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
The fanboy wank and this whole thing

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
You know, obviously the Zelda game will be

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
One of the games that has a hybrid thing

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
Going on with the next console, but

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
If they really want me to just lose my

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
Shit on whatever this new console is

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
How about that new F-Zero game already?

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
Huh?

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
Now that you're going to be all high def and stuff

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
Give me a new F-Zero game, why not?

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
I know seriously

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
The original F-Zero was a launch title for Super Nintendo

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
So it's not unheard of that F-Zero could be a launch title

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
Oh yeah

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
F-Zero and Pilotwings in Mario World

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
Were the original launch titles

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
I remember because I wanted them all

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
So there you go

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
Well how about something else that was on the SNES

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
How about it?

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
And we've already mentioned Final Fantasy

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
But Final Fantasy 6, which was released in the US

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
Initially as Final Fantasy 3

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
It is coming

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
Out on Virtual Console and

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
PlayStation Network

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
So it is

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
Going to be there available to play

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
And I don't

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
However see a date attached to this

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
In fact

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
I am trying to see if there's a date on the

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
Article and it does not

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
The release date is soon

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
Yeah it's soon

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
But it is also going to have

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
The full motion video

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
That came with

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
The PlayStation

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
Updates with the Chronicles

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
Oh it's like the opera scene and

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
The Kefka's Tower and a few others

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
Hopefully it won't have the shitty loading

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
Times

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
If it's going to be playing on PlayStation Network

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
It's probably going to be something you're downloading

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
So you won't have to worry about that

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
If it's all off the hard drive then the load time

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
Should be minimal

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
Depending on the emulator, I don't know

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
We've also put Flickr in here

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
Yeah, no

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
I've already got 50 million copies of this

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
Plus the original, so

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
Yeah I've got

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
A ROM, the cart, and then

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
The GBA

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
Port

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
I will probably still buy it

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
I will still buy it because I'm a consumer whore

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
And how?

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
And Final Fantasy 6

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
Is so fucking good

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
It's

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
So good

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
That was the game

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
When I was like 17, 18 years old

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
Now I told you about how I

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
Stayed home from school for a week

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
To play it

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
By telling everyone I had the flu

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
Final Fantasy 7

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
People hate on Final Fantasy 7

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
Because it's not more

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
Final Fantasy 6

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
Let's be honest, people didn't like the 3D thing

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
And people didn't like the whole Neo

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
7 was a great game

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
It was, but people hate on it because it wasn't

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
More of 6

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
7 was rushed by Sony

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
So it wasn't really even done

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
But yeah, I really wish that

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
5 and 6 got the DS

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
3D treatment that 3 and 4 did

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
Because those remakes were so good

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
But I guess on the 3DS the same thing could happen

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
Oh yeah, oh yeah, absolutely

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
Going to our chatroom at chat.orangelaunchready.com

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
Lots of

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
People perking up at the idea

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
Of F-Zero on the new Nintendo console

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
Being possible launch title

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
BlackWolf says F-Zero yes

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
I agree with F-Zero, Mieleki F-Zero

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
Mieleki F-Zero

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
Oh no, I'm sorry, Mieleki F-Zero was from Flaming Toilet

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
In our chatroom

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
BlackWolf continued up saying

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
F-Zero GX equals most beautiful GameCube game

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
Absolutely

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
You could put that game in the Wii

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
And you would not even be able to tell

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
It's a game from last gen

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
F-Zero GX is so good

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
It's like my favorite racing game

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
I think almost ever

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
Let's see

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
Kaijuto, not much of a fan

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
Of F-Zero, people love that F-Zero

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
I never liked it, it was too fast for me

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
My friend tried to top trade it off to me

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
And I hate it, well I'm talking about the first

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
F-Zero, that's the only one I saw and knew of

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
It made me sick, never liked it

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
See that's what I liked about F-Zero, was that it was fast

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
It's like

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
I don't know, it's like

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
When I first saw the commercials for

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
Blur and everything, I kind of thought it was

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
Going to be like F-Zero with real cars

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
I just don't think anything

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
Is going to be quite like F-Zero, but F-Zero

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
If that makes any sense

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
It's just such an awesome racing game

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
Rama in our chat room says

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
People hate On7 because it's the most popular

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
Hoard out and overplayed in the fandoms

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
Yeah

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
Yeah

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
That's part of it too

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
Alright, moving on with some more gaming news

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
SalaciousPop, what do you got for us?

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
Microsoft has registered a patent

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
For networked and

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
Personalized Kinect profiles

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
So that

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
People can get

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
The Kinect to remember their own

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
Unique mannerisms

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
And how to interact with the device

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
And also

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
That profile would follow you

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
If you ever went to a different

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
Xbox and imported your

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
It would be attached to your

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
Gamertag, is what I'm trying to say

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
And you can also use it to communicate

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
Possibly to other

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
XBLA users that may not speak

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
English

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
Or be able to communicate verbally

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
So they might get some

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
I don't know, like sign language

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
Stuff in there, but

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
Like a universal sign language type of thing?

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
That's kind of weird

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
When I was trying to use the Kinect

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
You know, you lift your hand up and you move it

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
Over the tile that you want and you have to hold it there

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
And you wait for the ring to spin around the hand icon

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
I wanted to like

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
Punch it

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
To the tile I wanted and I would go like this

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
And then you were like, no, just hold your hand still

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
And

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
I think if I could go and say

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
I don't like how the Kinect wants me to do

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
This particular

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
Command, here's how I want to do it

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
And have it save that and follow my profile around

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
I think that's what this patent is for

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
That'd be really cool

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Interesting, but then they throw in this whole

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
Phones and computers into it and I'm like

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
What, the phones are going to have Kinect in them?

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
I hardly think so

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
The profile comes in somehow

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
I guess Kinect isn't just about

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
The motions

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
But voice as well

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
So maybe the voice will activate your profile on the phone

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Seems a little strange

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
Yeah

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
Anyhow

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
Well I guess we'll see what comes to that

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
That could be something that Microsoft's planning on unveiling at E3

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
We'll see

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
Something else we might find out more on very soon

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
Is what is to come of this

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Online survey that EA is doing

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
As you know, surveys are a popular

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
Breeding ground for rumors

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
And this time it's about EA Sports

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
Apparently EA Sports is investigating

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
The reception to a paid subscription

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
That would deliver paid

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
Downloadable content for free

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
And make some full versions of upcoming games

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
Available to download before the release date

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
So it's like you could join the club

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
And then you get to break the

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
Excuse me, the embargo on games or something

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
Kind of sounds a little bit like Playstation Plus

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
But unique to EA or something, I don't know

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Some of the bullet points

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
That were mentioned in the survey

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Discounts on all downloadable content

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
For participating EA Sports console based

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
Titles

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
Let's see

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
That's the kind of stuff they're talking about asking

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
Also

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
Of course you can get the game on Playstation

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
Network or Xbox Live before it even

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
Comes out

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
That could be indicative of digital distribution

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
And kind of moving more towards that mechanism

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
So you would be able to

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
Bypass the store and buy the game

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
From EA directly so they could keep all the

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
Profits

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
That apparently is

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
The intent here, but you have to pay to join the club

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
To do that, you get to pay to join this club

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
So you can pay EA directly

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
And get the game early

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
That's what I'm reading out

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
Of this, right?

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
It's kind of what it is

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
So, hmm

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
We'll see, also one other thing that they're talking

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
About, the ability to transfer

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
Paid content from your current participating

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
Titles to future title versions

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
So, like, if you buy

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
$50 worth of extra

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
Golf courses in Tiger Woods 12

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
You would get to transport them to future

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
Games, which a lot of other game series

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
Are already doing for free

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Like DJ Hero did that, right?

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
You had the downloadable thing that would

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
Unlock, oh, anyway

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
You know, launch day DLC

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
The ability to turn left, five bucks

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
Launch day DLC, the ability to turn right

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
Five bucks

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
That's where I'm worried, but it's a racing game

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
So you only need to go forward

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
You don't have to get left and right if you don't want to

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
That's the one thing that excites me about what's

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Going on with Sony right now, which I know sounds really

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
Messed up, but if it does come out

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
That your personal data was put at risk

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
Digital distribution just got set back

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
Four years, guaranteed

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
If that comes out

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
Yeah, but then I think of Steam, and I

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
Think not really, but

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
I think

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
Yes and no, but

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
On the console level, yes

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
I don't know, Steam

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
Steam is really just a store

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
Where PSN and XBLA is more of an

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
Integrated

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
Matching process

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
They're still stores, but they're stores that are built into your console

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
It's a little different, whereas the PC

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
Isn't so much a console

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
You have the freedom to do whatever you want on the PC

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
Yeah, and there are alternatives to Steam

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
For the PC, it's the same platform

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
Right

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
So we will see what comes of

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
This possible paid subscription

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
In the future, moving on

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
Well, since we were on Steam and this is how

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
I bought the game

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
Super Meat Boy Ultra

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
Edition will be coming out in the UK

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
Sometime between July and September

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
This year

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
It will be published by Lace Mamba

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
Global

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
And it's going to be an actual boxed

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
Edition

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
That is going to be coming

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
Out, so it will have a 40 page

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
Booklet that has never before

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
Seen art, and some behind the scenes

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
Information, an extended version of

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
Team Meat comics, and

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
The soundtrack, and additional audio

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
And a mini poster

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
Yay, a poster

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
And

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
Then you also get a slab of rotted meat

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
And a band-aid

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
And you get a meat dress

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
You get a meat dress

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
Ok, maybe not

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
Maybe they have that as a marketing thing

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
Little bandages, Super Meat Boy Band-Aids

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
See, that would be a good idea to have bandage girl

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
Band-Aids

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
Absolutely

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
Copyright, Jamie, Orange Old Radio

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
Pay, pay, pay

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
Anyhow, let's move on

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
And travel the world with some release dates

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
And see what games are coming out to a store near you

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
It's going to be hard to top last week

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
But we'll see what happens

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
SlicesPop, why don't you start us off with what is coming out

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
This week in America

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
We didn't have a

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
Show last week, there are a few other titles

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
Aside from MK

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
And Portal that came out

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
And that was SoCom 4

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
Was another big one for last week

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
Nobody gets to play it right now

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
Yeah, totally

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
And then Final Fantasy 4, the complete collection

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
On PSP

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Huge week for games, huge

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
This week upcoming is

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
Pretty sparse

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
Considering people's

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
Wallets can't really take more

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
Gonzo weeks of

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Game releases like last week

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
So this one is pretty mellow

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
We have Operation Flashpoint

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
Red River on PS3 and

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
360

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
Haunted for PC

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
Operation Flashpoint

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
Red River again on PC

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
Darkspore on PC

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
And

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
IL-2

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
I cannot even pronounce this

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
Stramovic Cliffs of Dover on PC

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
Which sounds like a weird budget

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
Army game, I don't even know what that is

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
But that's it, it's like six titles

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
Bobby Blackwolf in our chatroom is lamenting

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
The non-mention of Conduit 2

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
Which also came out this last week

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
This was

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
Oh there it is, yeah, on the week

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
And poor little Conduit 2 is gonna get that a lot

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
This was not

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
A smart week to release that game

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
Sorry dudes, I don't know what else to say

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
I think some

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
Companies severely underestimated

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
The power of portal combat

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
On top of like SOCOM too

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
SOCOM is a huge game too

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
I actually think it was a dumb week to release

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
Final Fantasy 4 too

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
Especially considering that

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
The PSP does a lot through digital distribution

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
Now, well, nobody can buy that game

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
On the Playstation Network

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
Right now

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
Yikes. Let's go to Japan

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
And see if it's any different over there

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
This week in Japan on April 28th

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
El Shaddai, Ascension of the Metatron

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
Coming out on the Xbox 360

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
This game

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
Is coming out from Ignition

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
It's kind of an action based game

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
Kind of looking at some of the screenshots here

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
It looks kind of cool, looks like

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
The art style to this is kind of interesting

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
It kind of looks like that

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
Oh, what was that game?

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
I don't know, now I can't even remember the name of it

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
But yeah, it has this really unique art style

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
Reminds me of an old PC game

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
Alone in the Dark, is that what it's called?

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
I can't remember that. Let me see

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
It was a classic game of the week she did not that long ago

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
But I don't know why, the art style kind of reminds me of that a little bit

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
But yeah, it's kind of an action game

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
Maybe in the same vein as like Bayonetta

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
Type of thing where you play a dude with a sword

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
That is really pretty, I'm really big on it

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
Again, that's El Shaddai, Ascension of the Metatron

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
Comes out this week on the Xbox 360

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
Very biblically themed

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
Also this week on the Xbox 360 in Japan

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
Espagluta 2, Black Label

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
Platinum Collection

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
Espagluta

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
Price Reduction

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
That's bullet hell, right?

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
PlayStation 3 also gets El Shaddai this week

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
That's pretty much the only big release over there

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
On the PlayStation 3

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
On the Nintendo Wii this week, nothing

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
You're going to hear that a lot when it comes to the Nintendo Wii

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
Because there's nothing coming out

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
On the Nintendo 3DS, Deca Sporta

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
3D Sports comes out

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
That of course is Deca Sports

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
From Hudson in Japan

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
Coming out on the regular DS

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
Hakoyuki, Yugi Roku DS

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
Comes out this week

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
On the Nintendo DS non-3D

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
That's an adventure game

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
With little chibi characters that I'm sure

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
Most people don't care about

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
Because it's so last gen

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
And then lastly, the Sony PSP

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
Has a variety of games coming out this week in Japan

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
Including Patapon 3, which I believe came out over here as well

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:30.000
Saigo no Yakuzoku no Monogatari

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
Comes out as well this week

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
That is from Epic

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
That is a Japanese RPG

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
On the PSP

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
Looks like kind of

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
Man vs. Robot type of thing

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
And lastly

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
Otome wa Onesama no

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
I'm sorry, Ni Koi Shitiru

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
Portable 2

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
Jin no Elder comes out this week

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
As well and that is

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
One more adventure game on the PSP in Japan

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
And this is the one that features

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
Pretty Girls

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
And it looks like you play four Pretty Girls

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
Going on these quests

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
They're like looking through telescopes and dressing up

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
It's like the Spice Girls get their own RPG

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
Look at that

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
In Japan. How about Europe?

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
We have a few things for Europe

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
On the

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
26th is Mythos

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
And the 27th is Outland

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
And the 28th is Darkspore

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
Shin Megami Tensei Persona 3

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
Portable

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
Also on the 29th is Thor the video game

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
And

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
Virtua Tennis 4

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
That's it

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
Yay Virtua Tennis

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
Let's move on with another story

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
From Salacious Pot. The classic game of the week

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
Is coming up in just a little bit. Stay tuned

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
Okay so

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
As of the

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
16th which would have been I guess last

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
Weekend

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
The Wii console has experienced a price drop

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
Best Buy got to do it first

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
For about a day

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
Before everyone else

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
$170

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
And then every other major retailer

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
Started selling it at that

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
Price I think within 48 hours

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
Later so yeah that as of the

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
18th you can get a Wii kit for

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
170 bucks and also

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
Just more recently announced

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
Wii Sports Resort

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
And Wii Party which are the two

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
I guess they're bundle titles that you can also

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
Buy separately. Also got a

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
More of the staple titles

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
Of the current Wii lineup

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
If you just can't get enough Woohoo Island

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
Yeah

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
Those prices dropped

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
$10 down to

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
$39.99

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
Per title starting the

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
25th which is tomorrow

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
So Wii console cheaper

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
And the two staple games

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
If you didn't get them bundled

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
Are now $10 off as well

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
Now I just want to point this out because this is something you're

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
Not really reading in the news but you know

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
Loki has ties when it comes to

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
Selling things and he made this little note

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
In our little thread where we always talk

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
About what stories we're going to talk about on the show

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
And so I'm going to pass this little tidbit along

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
Do with it what you will. He says

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
Just the top five direct

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
Nintendo retailers. Not

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
All retailers. This is a

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
Temporary price drop to clear

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
Overstock inventory

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
I wonder why they'd want to

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
Move Wiis

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
Well I mean one

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
Could hypothesize that the new Nintendo console

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
Plays into this but come on

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
That's going to be a year away

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
Although I

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
I don't know. Part of me wants to say why would you

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
Announce a console at E3 when it's not going to come out

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
Till next year but that's exactly what they did with the 3DS

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
So that kind of refutes that

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
But I would think they would try to get it

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
Something out console wise this year

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
But we'll see. I don't know

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
I don't know what this price drop should be tried into

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
Maybe a new bundle. Maybe that's the

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
Route they're going to go. Maybe they're clearing

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
Overstock so they can do some Uber Wii bundle

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
That's going to come out for the holidays

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
In these two games like I just said

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
If you buy them all a cart you can also

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
Get a bundle with them

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
So they're just

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
Kind of taking up space now

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
There's got to be some type of Uber Wii coming out

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
Towards the end of the year

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
Is it called the Wii Wii?

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
None

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
Alright

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
Something you will not be able to play

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
On the Wii but you'll be able to play it on

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
The Xbox 360 and eventually

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
You'll be able to play it on the PlayStation 3

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
But news came out this week that Child of Eden

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
From Q Entertainment has been pushed

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
Back to September on the

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
PlayStation 3. The game is still

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
Coming out on June 14th for the

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
Xbox 360 with Kinect support

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
So why was it pushed back to September?

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
Well they haven't really

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
Said but they have said that it

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
Will now feature move support for the

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
PlayStation so perhaps that is the reason

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
Why it was pushed back was to include the

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
PlayStation Move support

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
I don't know why they bothered

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
They should have just patched that in later because

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
I kind of think the PlayStation Move

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
Is anyone still all about

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
PlayStation Move right now?

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
I mean one could argue is anyone about Kinect right now?

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
But I think there's at least a few people

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
Still dabbling in Dance Central

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
Once in a while at least

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
But as far as the move goes isn't everyone over that?

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
Well maybe Ubisoft was like

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
Yeah Sony so your network

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
Has been down for five days so we're

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
Gonna give you some time to fix that

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
Well to be fair September no I'm kidding

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
I think this news came out before that I know I'm just being an ass

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
Yeah no I know

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
Alright well let's move on

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
To a segment we like to do on the show every

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
Week it's a chance for Dark Soccer to take

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
A trip down memory lane

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
And visit

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
Classic Games from Gaming's Past

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
It's the classic game of

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
The week segment and Dark Soccer

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
Is gonna dive into the vault head first and

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
Find a game that she says hey

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
You little brats

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
This is a classic game you should check out right

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
Freaking now Dark Soccer

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
What is the classic game of the week?

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
The game of the week is called

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
Narbacular Drop

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
And this is a game I have brought up before

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
I see what you're doing here

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
Exactly I figured with Portal 2 coming out

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
It's best to get to the root

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
Alright let's listen to some of the ambience

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
From Narbacular Drop

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
Yeah

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
Hopefully

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
There wasn't a lot of sound in this game I believe

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
But it had some decent music

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
Well

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
At any rate Narbacular Drop is

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
The precursor to

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
Portal it was

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
A free game online in 2005

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
For the PC ran in DirectX 9

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
And it was

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
The senior game project of students

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
Going to DigiPen

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
They actually named it Narbacular Drop

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
Because Narbacular is not really a word

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
And so it would help the thing be found

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
On search engines really easily

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
So basically

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
The whole premise is that

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
There was a princess

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
No knees

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
As in no dash K-N-E-E-S

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
Who is unable to jump

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
She was captured by a demon and imprisoned

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
So she found out that since

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
The prison is actually a

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
Ascension creature named Wally

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
And has a portal making ability she could

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
Escape through using portals

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
So basically

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
It has the whole first person

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
Shooter vibe like Quake

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
But it has the portals in there too

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
You have to solve different puzzles

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
You can definitely see where this led to

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
Portal

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
So you create the different interconnected portals

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
You can actually shoot portals through portals as well

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
Which was very interesting

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
It really helped

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
But you'd have boxes and boulders

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
And things to avoid

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
You have different switches to do

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
That you can't save in the game

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
And it really

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
Is very complex

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
You only have about six puzzles

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
In that because

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
Again, this was a senior project

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
But it's super

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
It's super good, it's actually pretty

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
Pretty fun

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
And so basically

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
The group that developed it

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
Was snatched right up

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
By Valve and said

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
We like this idea, make us portal

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
And they're like, okay

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
Sure, we'd like to do that

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
And uh

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
So they did

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
And uh

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
It's actually

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
You can actually go get this for free

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
It is online

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
It will run on just about any

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
PC and it's

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
Nothing great to look at, it looks like

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
You know

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
Sprightly like Quake

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
Like early Quake and Doom and Hexen

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
Well I mean, it is 3D

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
But it's 3D with sprite

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
Textures. And I think something is important to mention too

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
It looks nothing like Portal. No, it looks nothing

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
Like Portal. It does not have that test chamber look

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
It looks more like a medieval castle type of look

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
And I think that's one very common misconception

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
About Immaculate Drop, is that it looks like Portal

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
It really doesn't. No, it's

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
It's set, you're a princess escaping

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
From a dungeon, trapped by

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
A demon, so

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
The story is different

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
However, the premise is the same

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
You have to use your portals

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
Solve puzzles and get out, while not being

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
You know, jumped on by creatures

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
And falling in the lava

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
And having GLaDOS, wait, wrong game

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
Right

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
So, it's, it's, I've gotten Immaculate Drop

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
I've gotten a few puzzles through it

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
And honestly, it's a little bit harder

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
For me to get through, because early 3D

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
Like that kind of

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
It gives me a headache

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
If that makes sense

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
Like, I can do all the sprite based 3D

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
Like games just fine, but if it's

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
Actual 3D with the sprite based textures

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
Then it makes me kind of sick

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
But, um, it's, it's still

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
A fun little game, I mean, it's free

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
Why not? And

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
I've got it attached to, well I mean you can't

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
Download it through Steam, but I have it attached to my

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
Steam account, so, I just launch it

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
Through that, but, it's, it's a

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
A fun little game, it really is

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
It's just

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
It's a small download

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
It's really

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
Simple, it's just simple and fine

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
That's all, and so if you want to see the origins

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
Of Portal, you should definitely try

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
Immaculate Drop

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
With the little, horribly drawn

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
Story bits at the beginning

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
It's really neat to see, too

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
Like, how freaking far this game

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
Evolved, too, like it just, it

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
You go play Immaculate Drop, it's, it's

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:15.000
Really nothing like Portal

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:16.000
This is six years ago

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
But it's, I mean, it's cool, don't get me wrong

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
It's a cool little game, but it's, uh

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
And the whole point is that

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
The other reason why it was only six

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
Levels is because, number one, it was

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
A final project, but number two, they were trying to

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
Demonstrate that they could establish these physics

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
Within a virtual environment that would

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
Work, so

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
I want to say that the original

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
Way that this was done was by

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
Completely duplicating and re-rendering

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
The room when you threw the Portal

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
But now, with Portal 2,

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
It's just, not with Portal 2, but

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
With the actual Portal, they redid

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
Those, um, those

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
Physics to where it actually would just

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
Respawn you through a particular point

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
I remember, um

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
There's a

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
Something about this on the Portal

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
Commentary, where they were

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
Talking about the difference in, um

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
Programming and what went into

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
You know, what they changed

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
From Immaculate Drop to Portal

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
And how certain things wouldn't carry over

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
And how certain things had to carry over

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
So, it's pretty neat

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
Alright, and Valve is one of the few

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
Major studios that are known

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
To do it quite often

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
To, um, hire

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
Employees from the community

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
Whether it be the Phantom community or to just

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
Go to the studio that made Immaculate Drop and just

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
Say, um, we want to

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
You know, buy your shop and

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
Bring you in for this project, and

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
It's clearly smart, and honestly

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
I think that it's for

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
The best for a lot of companies to really

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
Look toward the new generation coming out and they

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
Give the new people a chance

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
Because

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
With so few

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
New ideas

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
This is my thought

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
People are going to eventually run out of new ideas

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
There's not going to be anything new anymore

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
People are going to think of it all

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
So you need to get a fresh source of

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
Information instead of, you know, people

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
Who are maybe a few years stale

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
So I think it's a great idea

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
Alright

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
They totally get kudos

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
There it is, your classic game of the week, an Arbacular Drop

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
A little bit newer of a game, but certainly

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
With all the brouhaha about

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
Portal 2 this week, it's important to know the roots

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
Of such a landmark game

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
I would seriously like

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
At least five of our listeners

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
To download it and send me an email

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
What you think of it

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
And it's super free, right?

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
You can download it all over the place

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
Alright

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
There it is, and that's usually your classic games of the week

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
Are like obscure fucking Sega titles

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
That'll cost you $100 on eBay

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
This one is free

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
It's in Space Fantasy Zone

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
You can download that online

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
We're going to take a break here live, folks

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
We've got plenty more show to come

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
It's been a pretty busy week, we've got to talk about Mega Man Legends 3

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
There was some news on that this week

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
Talk about, yet again, Guitar Hero

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
Rob, before I forget

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
I am posting the download link in the chatroom

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
Alright, so go download it ASAP

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
And let Dark Soccer know your thoughts

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
Especially if you haven't played before

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
Alright, we're going to take a quick break, guys

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
We'll be back, though, plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
Lots of emails tonight, too, speaking of wanting emails

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
I was looking at the email bag earlier

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
It has built up over the past couple weeks, yay

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
So we get lots of voices tonight

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
And phone calls coming up before the night is over

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
So stay tuned, guys

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
On this Easter Sunday, episode 410 of Orange Lounge Radio

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
We'll be right back after this

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
We are live on this Sunday evening

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
April the 24th of 2011

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
With the 410th episode of our show

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
And, uh, yeah

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
We've been talking about a lot of news tonight

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
There's been a lot of gaming

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
Big games that came out in the last week

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
And, of course, a lot of news to go with that

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
We've got plenty more to cover, though

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
But first, we'll do some plugs for our side projects

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
Some of the other shows that we work on

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
On the side, Dark Sakura, what do you do?

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
You have another little show

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
Well, when we do it

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
We have Comic Insanity

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
Have you been off a couple weeks or something?

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
We've been off for a few weeks because of, you know

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
Stuff going on this week, last week, and the week before

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
So, um

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
But it's what I do with

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
Mar and Marvel, Tiara, and Dan Shadow

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
And we typically

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
Have a new podcast up every Tuesday

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
At infamous.net

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
N-F-A-M-O-U-S.net

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
And you can also follow us on Twitter

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
So check us out

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
And we'll see you next week

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
Bye people!

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
But not always on

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
It's been a hectic month, you know

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
And besides that, now next month, finals

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
Yikes

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
Well, we've

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
We're still doing the side project I've got going on

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
With Extrovert

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
The best little Horde house in Azeroth

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
Also known as Horde house for short

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
If you like World of Warcraft

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
Or even if you hate it, but you just enjoy

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
Extrovert talking about his Wang

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
And everything

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
And yeah, we were off last week inadvertently

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
We had Comcast go down 30 minutes into the show

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
So we had like a jumbo episode

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
This week, so it's like two hours of wow talk

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
This week, that's a lot of wow

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
Definitely a lot of wow

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
Alright, let's get into some rapid fire news

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
Some quick news stories

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
That we wanted to bring up at some point on tonight's show

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
Loki's gonna start us off

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
Oh wait, he's not here

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
Bob's gonna start us off

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
Well, when you sit in the chair

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
Yeah

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
Bob's gonna start us off cause Loki has the night off

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
Okay, so here's a

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
Feel good human interest story

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
That's gonna make you go aww

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
Skip it

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
A gamer

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
Who goes by the name of Ben

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
I don't know if that's his handle or his real name

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
Started dating

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
A nice young lady

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
And eventually at some point during the relationship

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
When they were hitting it off

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
He gave her the gamer talk

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
If we don't have plans, I'm gonna be parked in front of the TV

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
For hours playing my games

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
And you need to be okay with that

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
And her response was

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
You play Borderlands, right? Fire it up

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
So, yeah

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
So the two of them played all through

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
Borderlands

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
And all of the DLC

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
And I guess Ben went to Gearbox

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
And told him this lovely

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
Story of gamer romance

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
And said that he was going to propose to her

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
And Gearbox

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
Made a video

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
Called Borderlands modest proposal

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
Which you can find on YouTube

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
Where they have their sassy

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
Rude

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
Profanity dropping

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
Mascot

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
Claptrap, he does a

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
Wedding proposal

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
Marriage proposal video

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
For this fan

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
It took him about a week to make it

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
It addresses her by name

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
So Ben was like, hey I want you to look

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
You know

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
Help them get to know each other

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
And then they got divorced in three months

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
See, it's called a Borderlands modest proposal

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
The YouTube channel is

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
Taco Bell manager

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
Yeah

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
Sorry, this is really funny

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
Gearbox helped this loving

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
I hope you like Borderlands and I hope you like

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
Gorditas

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
Because you're going to get a lot of that

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
And I haven't had a chance

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
To watch, it's about a minute and a half

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
And I guess they got their writers to put in some jokes

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
Yeah, so

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
Took them a week to do that?

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
Lord, game companies work slow

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
Alright, I'm just kidding, I'm kidding

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
Okay, so then

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
They got paid in 39 cent tacos

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
Next we have a story about

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
YouTube video sensation

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
Freddy Wong

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
And I look through his channel and I don't recognize

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
Stuff, but

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
He put out a character

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
I guess he's a computer animator

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
And he does a lot of, you know

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
YouTube mini movies

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
And he put out a character called

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
Mr. Toots

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
Mr. Toots is a tiny

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
Knee high unicorn

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
And this here, it's half

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
It's half live action, half CGI

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
And Freddy Wong

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
Finds Mr. Toots in a cardboard box

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
Out on the street, and Mr. Toots

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
Is a little knee high unicorn that

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
Shoots rainbows out of its ass

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
So those of you that are in

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
Robot unicorn attack

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
Are just rainbow unicorn

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
Fandom hilariousness

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
Oh, I love rainbow unicorns

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
This is that guy that did that

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
Portal video

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
The portal gun delivery

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
I'm looking at the video here

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
So here's the, he lifts up the box

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
And there's the little

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
I'm like two seconds behind you

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
Creepy looking unicorn

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
Aw, there's the unicorn

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
Hey, looks like we got a car coming

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
So let's get out of the road, huh?

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
My favorite is the dude exploding in like the

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
Mortal Kombat blood all over it

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
The skeleton

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
So this is gaming related

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
Because it turns out that Mr. Toots

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
Has been copyrighted and registered

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
To Volition Inc

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
The developer behind

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
THQ's Red Faction

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
And Saints Row series

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
So whether the character came first

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
And the THQ snatched it up

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
Or he was commissioned for this little dude

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
Um, we're like

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
What on earth

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
Is this, is Volition gonna do with this character?

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
This guy actually

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
Borrowed the model

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
He credits him in the end of the video

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
Borrowed the model from somebody

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
So it could be like some cross promotion

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
And see I love this joke in our chatroom from Randy

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
Cause somebody had to make this joke

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
chat.orangestonshoot.com

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
Mr. Toots and the pink anus

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
Remember the magical unicorn game on Steam with the

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
Pink anus

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
A-E-N-U-S that you buy as a material

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
Yeah, lots of anus going on in this game

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
Oh yeah, so it does look like

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
That Mr. Toots came from THQ first

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
And then this Freddie Wong guy

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
Did the promotional thing for it

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
You know what's funny about the anus?

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
What? Everything's funny about anus

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
I always get it confused with this candy

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
In Japan called A-S-S-E

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
I guess it's A-SE or A-S-ER

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
Uh huh, but it looks like ass

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
When you get it out of the box

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
Mmm, tastes like ass

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
So yeah

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
The biggest part of this story is just the whole

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
What factor and the fact that it's from

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000
Volition, so where are they gonna

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
Drop this dude? Maybe he'll be

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
A playable character in Saints Row 3

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
You know, you're running

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
You're on drug missions and instead of

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
Getting an Uzi you're just shooting rainbows out of your ass

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
At people, I don't know

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
Ass

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
Thank you to our soccer for derailing the show with ass

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
And my last

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
Quickfire story is even though

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
Activision has pulled the plug on the

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
XYZ

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
Hero franchises

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
With guitar or DJ

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
It looks like DJ Hero 2 is getting

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
At least one more

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
DLC pack, not sure if it's the last

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
But it's still getting content

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
And it's a UltraMix pack by

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
I'm blanking

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
I just had it up here

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
Deadmau5, sorry

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
Deadmau5 is putting out a

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
Three song

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
Track pack for DJ Hero 2

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
House Music by Benny Benassi

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
Sophie Needs a Ladder by Deadmau5

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
And We Speak No Americano

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
By YolandaBeCool and

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
DCUP

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
CUP

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
Womp womp

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
You're gross

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
Anything else?

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
That's it for me

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
Let's go to the other music game that comes up once in a while

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
On this program, it used to come up a lot on this program

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
BeatMania 2DX

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
Is having its 19th

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
Version being tested

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
It's called Linkle

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
Not sure what that's supposed to mean

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
It's L-I-N-C-L-E, Linkle

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
It kinda looks like Uncle

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
But with the U kinda, I think it'll be a better name

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
BeatMania 2DX 19, Uncle

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
Uncle! Make it stop

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
These songs don't sound the same

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
What was 17 and 18? It was like Duchess, Empress

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
One was Empress, you got it

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
Empress was one, and then the other one was Sirius

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
But not like the radio, it's the

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
Constellation in the sky

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
So this one is Linkle

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
And I don't know, it kinda has like a sci-fi

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
Theme going on, whatever

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
Some of the new games, or some of the new songs

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
That are coming out in it, I don't, I don't even recognize

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000
These bands anymore, like I used to be so into

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000
This series. Sota Fujimori

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
I remember him with a song called Lucky Days

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
Let's see, Chorus K,

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
Drive Me Crazy

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
I remember

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
Dark Tetsuya was saying something in the

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
Thread about a song called F

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
Or something like that

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
From like, you know, just like, oh there it is

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
DJ Amuro doing F

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
He did the song A

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
Now he's moved on to other letters of the alphabet

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
So we get a song called F

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
Some of the other things that are coming to

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
2DX 19th style, as I will forever call it

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
A light blue theme

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
Apparently in the game

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
Song previews have been added

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
For normal gameplay mode, that's pretty cool

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
So you can actually hear what the song sounds like

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
Finally, 19 games later

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
Let's see, a hard EX

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
Option added

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000
It is even harder than hard

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
That's a direct quote, harder than hard

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000
And some songs, unfortunately

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
Have been removed from the game

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
Because, you know, they have to delete

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
Old songs to make room for the new ones

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
Luckily, because I don't follow the series anymore

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
I don't recognize any of these songs that they've removed

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
But there you go, Beat Media 2DX

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
Linkle. Now, I would care about

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
Beat Media 2DX again if they would put out the home versions

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
Because, especially if they came out on PlayStation 3

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
Yeah, PlayStation 3

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
Because it's not region coded

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000
And you have your controllers that we

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
Packed, and I want to play those

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
We're already getting Tingle things in the chat room

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
By the way

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
Tingle and Linkle? Nice

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
You know, Tingle

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
If Tingle and Link had a baby

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
It would be Linkle

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
BlackWolf in our chat room says

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
2DX lives on where Guitar Hero dies

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
Well, in Japan anyway

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
But you don't really see anything about it here

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
They should have an insane 4 controller

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
Version where you use your toes

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
Beat Media 2DX was a lot of fun

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
It really was, I just, I don't know

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
Bring back the Effector Pedal

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
Like, two arcades have it anymore

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000
You know, Arcade Infinity is gone

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
You can go to, what, Sunnyvale Golf Line

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
Or Milpitas? One of the two still has it

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000
And they got rid of ours

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
That's one arcade in the Bay Area

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000
They probably have the one that RVGL got rid of

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000
Maybe

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
That's so stupid, they didn't get rid of 2DX

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
Dr. Suya says they deleted Power Dream

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
I did like that song

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
You know what, we just need to

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
Have a Bimani party

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
No, we don't

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
Unless you're going to kick it like it's, you know

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
2002 all over again

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
Well, after three songs

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
And we're all covered in sweat because we're not in the shape

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
That we used to be in doing 9 footer songs

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000
No, and that's just from playing 2DX

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
Nice

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000
Alright, some other things

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
An Xbox exclusive

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
Mortal Kombat fighter was discussed

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
According to Ed Boon

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
Saying, quote, unfortunately the circumstances

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
Didn't allow us to make a 360 exclusive

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
Character. I'm not allowed to talk

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
Too much about it, but I can tell you we certainly

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
Wanted to do an exclusive for 360

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
But that's all I can say

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
And unfortunately that's leaving everybody to

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
Try and guess, what could the

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
Character have been?

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
Well, I can't really think of that many

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
Iconic, Microsoft licensed

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
Only characters they have

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
Because Kratos obviously is a Sony only

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
Property, he's very recognizable

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
One of the Gears of War dudes

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000
Marcus Fenix

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000
Master Chief, which would be kind of dumb

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000
In that universe, because at least Kratos has got

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
The whole medieval and the blades

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
Right, how about that chick from

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
Cameo, what's she doing these days?

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000
That could have been the character

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000
She's playing Uno with the Kameo

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
Uno pack, that's it

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
Or a nondescript dude from Fable

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
I think probably what Microsoft had a problem

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
With was the fatalities

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
And it's, you know, to have your character

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
Die a horrible death

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
Is something that's

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
Hard for some people

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
God of War already had the rendered

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
Guts and the eviscerations and the titties

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
For no reason, so Kratos is at home

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
In Mortal Kombat

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
Microsoft doesn't really have

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
A character like that, unless chat can think

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
Of one that we're forgetting

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
Unless, you know, I don't see them

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
Splitting Master Chief in half

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
And his little midsection

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
It's gross, some of those fatalities are gross

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
Which, by the way, I am gonna try and get that video

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
Of my mom playing Mortal Kombat, just so you know

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
Working on that

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
I told her about the project today

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
She's like, what?

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
So I don't know what character it could have possibly been

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
I mean, if it had been Marcus Fenix or something

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
I think the problem would have been with the fatalities

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
That's why they had to change up DC Universe

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
But, I mean, it's one thing

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
To do it for a single Xbox character

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
It's another to change the game for

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
DC Universe, I mean, that's why they

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
Or, I'm sorry, THE DC Universe

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
I'm gonna be confused with the game DC Universe

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
You know what I mean, though

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
One other quick thing I want to say

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
It's about the 3DS Ocarina of Time

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
We all know that game is coming out on the 3DS

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
That's another big thing they're gonna pimp for this holiday season

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000
There's gonna be a new feature in the game

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
Called the Boss Challenge Mode

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
It's an all fighting mode

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
You go up against any of the bosses you've encountered on the main quest

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
You can take on the bosses individually

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
Or all at once in a continuous battle

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
That's all we know

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
One little unlock feature that'll be in the game

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
Is an extra mode

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000
Kinda sounds a little silly to me

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000
But I guess whatever extra crap they can throw in there

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000
To make it seem worth it again

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000
They will do, so we'll see

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
DarkSakura, you got a few stories for us?

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
I have a few

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
Konami Style, which is notable for often having

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
Pretty expensive stuff up there

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
Remember the arcade style 2DX

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
And pop and music controllers?

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
Well, they have a

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
$380 Pyramid Head

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
Sculpture now

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
Tomopop

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
Is basically saying this is the only

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
Officially licensed Pyramid Head

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
To date

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
The actual price is

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000
31,500 yen

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
Or about 382 bucks

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
And it's a pretty sick looking figure

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
I gotta say

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
He's all wearing his

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
Skin

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
Outfit with the big

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
Pyramid on his head

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
And the great knife

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
Is actually specifically Silent Hill

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
Homecoming

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
So it looks pretty cool, and I'm gonna show

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
Our chat room what it looks like

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
None of you get to see hahahahaha

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
There you go

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
Chat room

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
Can I jump in with some comments real quick

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000
About Mortal Kombat specifically

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
Some ideas from the chat room

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
About who that missing Mortal Kombat character

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
Could have been

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
Randy suggests Larry Erb

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
Come on, it's not supposed to be real people

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
Let's see

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
Defective Candy suggests Clippy

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000
The Microsoft Help character

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000
I like that idea

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
And then Black Wolf says

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
That the Wii character

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
Could have been Woohoo Island

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
Could have been the character in the game

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
Because imagine how that fatality would have worked

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
The fatality would have been you would have had to run

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
Like in Wii Fit

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
I don't know

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
Imagine Mario and Luigi in a Mortal Kombat game now

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000
Where they take a monkey wrench and just

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000
Show it through someone's throat

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
All these angry parents writing letters

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
Like I just, I love it

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
I don't know

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
Sorry Jamie, I just had to get that out there

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
I love the Clippy one too much

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
That's a good idea for a character

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
Microsoft Bob

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000
Awesome figure, awesome figure is awesome

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
And

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
In Portal 2, the little

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
Egg shaped turrets have an easter egg

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
I have not heard this

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
So I'm going to have to check it out

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000
Myself later, but it's on YouTube

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
You guys can check it out

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
Should I be bringing this up here?

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
Um, if you like

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
I'll go read the next story while you do that

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000
I got it, I got it, I got it

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000
What, this is a little song they sing?

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
What is this?

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
It looks like around level 16

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
Trying to see if I recognize this level

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:26.000
Let me skip ahead a little bit

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000
The turrets serenading you

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
Is an event that happens later in the game

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000
I remember seeing this part

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
In one of the levels

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
Where the turrets were like unreachable

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
This part looks familiar to me

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
But I don't remember them singing like this

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
Weird

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
Alright, anyway

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
It would be funny if

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
When you're doing the defective turrets

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
If you could get one that sings instead of the

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
I'm a turret, huh

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
Turret

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
All of the lethal functioning turrets are female

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000
But the incompetent dunce turrets are male

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
But there's

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
Well, and the same goes with Wheatley

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
Yeah

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
But I've noticed that

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
Actually something that they pointed out in the first Portal

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
Is that there's so much

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
Female oriented

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
Stuff in the game like

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
Bring your daughter to work day

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
And GLaDOS being female

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
And the main character being female

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000
So they're just keeping up with that theme

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
Yeah, go Pawa

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
It's like the Silent Hill movie

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
Before they added the needless character

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
Sean Bean

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
So

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
More Portal 2 information

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
Is actually for PC and Mac

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
On Steam there are some

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
Fixed patch that will

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
Fix unrecoverable black screen

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000
In the elevator save

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
Fixed infinite loop on

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
Mac OS X server

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
Fixed Mac OS X font rendering

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000
And glyph corruption

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
Fixed GC memory leak various location

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000
Content improvements

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
Support for English subtitles and Turkish builds

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
Because people in Turkey love their Portal

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000
Minor string interface glitches

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
Fixes for multiple crashes

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
Improved detection handling

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
Various errors and or crashes

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000
Activated UI to enable joystick in game

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
That's pretty cool

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000
However it

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000
Did get a 10 out of 10

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000
From Eurogamer so

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
I think it's pretty sweet

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
It's sick

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000
And that's it

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
Nice

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000
I was gonna say part of the reason

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
That they had to give the

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
Turkish language support

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000
That Hakan from Street Fighter 4 threatened

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
To kick their ass if they didn't add that

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
He was gonna threaten to oil himself up and send nude photos

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
Yes he was gonna oil himself up and send

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000
Nude pictures if that didn't happen

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
Let's go to the Twitter

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000
Get some Twitter topics, actually shit I forgot to ask

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
For them so we may not have anything on Twitter

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000
But let's see what happens if I go to the Twitter

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
Twitter.com slash OLR and let's see what happens

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
When Rob forgets to request these things

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
Let's see if we got anything anyway

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000
Let's see, logging into Twitter

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000
Clearly I'm prepared for this

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
Segment tonight, Twitter.com slash OLR

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
Oh we do, oh we do have some tweets

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
Look at this, uh let's see

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000
Redertainment says

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
On Twitter, given her biting

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
Yet funny insults

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000
How do you think GLaDOS would deliver a

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000
Yomana joke, I think he meant to say

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
Yo mama, but he typed Yomana

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000
Which is actually really funny, I don't know why

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000
It would be this, your mother is dead

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000
Yeah

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000
That's very good

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
I like that, I like that

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
There's a joke in there, alright

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
SSJ100Matt is on

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000
Twitter saying

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
Hey it's Easter, what ever happened to Pete

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
Jousting, also what's your

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000
favorite totally not kosher for

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000
Passover Easter candy

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000
Oh good question

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000
Waffles

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000
I couldn't have waffles

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000
I wanted waffles so bad

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000
What ever happened to

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
Pete Jousting, actually I was trying to explain

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000
Pete Jousting to my mother this morning

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000
Right, remember I was explaining

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000
You brought it up

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000
Yeah there's a very

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000
Like

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
You're either

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000
Someone that doesn't mind peeps or will eat them

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
Or you think they're the most vile

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
Fucking candy on the base of the earth

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000
Yeah so we

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000
Brought up peeps at this

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000
Easter breakfast and

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
Rob's mom and I think

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
Aunt

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000
You say the two relatives were like

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000
Peeps

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
Like cousin in law

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
So they were going through their whole

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
Peeps are gross rant and we mentioned

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000
Peep Jousting

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
That was after my cousin's son

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
Who's 9 years old was threatening to

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000
Look up the show on the internet so God I hope

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000
He didn't find it

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000
So you need to turn it off

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.000
Your mother's gonna

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000
Mother's gonna kick your butt

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
I'm surprised that there wasn't

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
More bacon at the

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000
Event

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
Let's not get into that

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000
But yeah Peep Jousting I don't know

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000
I haven't done Peep Jousting in a long time

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000
What about the other part of the question

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000
What's your favorite totally not kosher for passover

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000
Easter candy

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000
The problem with that is that

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000
Candy would be okay as long as it's not

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.000
Made with flour

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000
You know like something with a crust

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000
Pocky

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
Yeah you could have Pocky

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000
But I don't really think of Pocky as

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000
Easter

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000
My favorite Easter candy

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.000
Would be jelly beans that aren't

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.000
Jelly belly like and I can only

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000
Really eat them around Easter because

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.000
I can't eat them everyday

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.000
You don't like the gelatin stuff

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000
Anyway you can't really eat that stuff but I like

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000
Regular jelly beans especially the black ones

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000
That are just pure licorice

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
Barf black licorice barf

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
Barf

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
I'll pick the black ones out of whatever

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.000
You can't have milk chocolate while you're

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000
Having fried chicken

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000
But I can really only eat them at Easter time

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
I can't eat them other time of the year

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000
Jelly belly is the rest of the year

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000
Is all I can eat

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000
Now I'm imagining chocolate covered

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000
Chicken and that would just be gross

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.000
Go to any state fair in the south

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.000
Well you're from the south you know

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000
It would be chocolate covered chicken deep fried

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.000
In like bacon fat

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000
Ew

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000
Alright we got some other uh

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000
Oh I will tell you one thing

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000
My friend made bacon brownies

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
I see that

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000
I told her that when all this is over

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.000
She used to make me some turkey bacon brownies

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.000
Uh what about you? So I just popped

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.000
Favorite Easter candy?

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000
Uh the Reese's peanut butter cup eggs

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000
Just cause it's just a big flat

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000
Peanut butter cup and those are amazing

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.000
You know what I don't like are cream eggs

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000
Gross

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000
People worship those things but they are too

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000
Much they are too much

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000
The mini they have those mini

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000
Cream eggs now those I can eat

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000
Touch of Britain sells Mars eggs

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.000
Marzipan?

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.000
No Mars bars eggs

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000
And they also have um these uh

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000
Dark chocolate truffle eggs

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000
Cause there are all kind of cream eggs

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000
Sold you know in England and these

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000
Are just they're all Cadbury

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000
The ones that they carry they also have the um

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000
The

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000
Galaxy ones

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
They sell those too and the arrow ones

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
They're all puffed air chocolate eggs

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
So good anyway I need to go get my

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
Mars egg let me get some more tweets

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000
Flaming toilet is tweeting us

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000
Upgrading to a new swim swim

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000
A new slim PlayStation 3

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000
And tired of waiting for PSN to come

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000
Back is it okay to do

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000
Data transfer utility or do I

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
Risk losing data?

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
I don't know I have no idea

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
Data transfer between his old

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000
System and his new one? That's what I'm assuming

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000
Okay uh like kind of like a license

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000
Transfer I'm assuming like what you do on 360

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000
I've never had to do that before uh

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000
I wouldn't risk it like honestly

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000
Right now not a good time to try that cause it

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000
Depending on when

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000
His slim was

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000
Manufactured and put on the shelves

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000
He's probably a few OS

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000
Updates behind and that

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.000
Once he actually gets the slim

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000
Online it's like oh we need to update you to

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000
Point six I don't know what number they're on

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000
And that might invalidate his certificates

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
So just wait

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
Good point yeah you're gonna have to wait it out sorry

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
Uh and let's see

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000
One more tweet from TigerCloth305

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000
On Twitter says it's a tweet

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000
The DS Lite is going to be discontinued

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000
Uh yeah that was some news

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000
That was circulating this week is that the DS Lite

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000
Is no more and he's linking

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000
Us to a story on oneup.com

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
That apparently references a NeoGaf post

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000
Where there is documents going out

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000
Uh Nintendo is not offering

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000
Any comment on this right now

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000
But I guess some of the older DS's are

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.000
Being discontinued which makes sense I mean

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000
Well I think every person

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.000
In the developed world

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000
Has one

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000
Including their pets

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000
Like my cat has a DS Lite I'm kidding

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:58.000
But no I think yeah that's

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000
They're pretty um

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000
Prevalent

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:04.000
Yeah and they're not getting

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000
Rid of the DSi or the

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000
DS XL that's important to know

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.000
And I still want one of those too but yeah

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000
So there's no why why not just get the 3DS

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000
I don't know those screens are big

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
It's well the 3DS is backwards compatible

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000
With the regular DS right

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000
But not the advanced games

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000
So you like must play Game Boy advanced games

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000
Well they haven't had the GBA port on the DS

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000
In a while oh that's right they got rid of

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000
That with the DSi yeah so I guess that's the

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000
One thing you're losing with the DS Lite

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000
No more Game Boy advanced games

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000
So there you go

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000
Let's see one more tweet

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000
Tigerclaw got in one more and why not

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000
I'll go ahead and read this one

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000
Chrono Trigger apparently is

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000
Also coming out so I guess this is in the same

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000
Vain as the Final Fantasy 6 thing we heard about earlier

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000
Apparently Chrono Trigger for the

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000
PlayStation 3 and PSP

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
Was outed by an ESRB listing

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000
So this is probably just right in that

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.000
Up the same alley as Final Fantasy 6

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.000
Because Chrono Trigger was released for the

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000
PlayStation 1

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000
Yeah so this is yeah the

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000
What was that called was it the Final Fantasy

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.000
Chronicles that had Chrono Trigger in it?

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.000
Chronicles yeah the other one was the Anthology

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000
Yeah so um

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000
It's probably just obviously a port of that

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000
Because that's already been out on Sony the

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.000
DS port with the extra

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000
Dungeon and the endings and stuff

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.000
Is probably still the better

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.000
Chrono Trigger

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:24.000
Release that you'd want to

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.000
Get rather than this one but

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000
Give us a legit Chrono Trigger sequel already

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.000
Like I know there's Chrono Cross but I mean

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000
Seriously how long ago was that?

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000
Damn Square

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000
Everybody loses their shit

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.000
Over that game and yet we still don't have

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000
Like something in that canon

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.000
It's weird one of the reasons why I still

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000
Want a DS XL is because

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000
Chrono Trigger

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000
Port on the DS

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000
I can see it fine it's not like I'm blind but

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.000
Just those sprites I want them on a bigger screen

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.000
So fair enough

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:56.000
Alright let's move on with some more

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000
Gaming news and then we're gonna get to your

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000
Phone calls before too long and emails

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.000
We have lots of emails tonight can't wait to do that

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.000
Dark Soccer's gotta work tonight

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.000
Yay alright

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000
Slaces pop more news

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.000
So after that

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000
A couple weeks ago we

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000
Announced that the Mega Man

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.000
Project that Capcom was working on

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000
Was scrapped but they're still

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000
From what we understand working on Mega Man

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000
Legends 3 that has a huge

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000
Fandom that really wants that game to come out

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000
The Capcom

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000
Has announced that they are putting out

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.000
A Mega Man Legends 3

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.000
Prototype version which is

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.000
Sort of a beta

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000
Slash demo it's

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000
I'm not sure if it's gonna have a full

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000
Start to finish or it's a separate episode

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000
That may not necessarily be in the full release of the game

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
But it's just

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.000
What they have compiled that runs

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000
Well they're gonna put it out

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000
For the 3DS

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000
And on their eShop

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000
It's supposed to hit in late May

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000
And there's a playable

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000
Character named Barrett

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000
And it offers a few missions

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000
Not to be confused with the first person ever to

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000
Say shit in Final Fantasy

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000
Just so you know

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000
So you play as Barrett and it's gonna have a few missions

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.000
Though it's probably gonna be spammed

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000
With loading screen messages

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.000
That just say this is not a finished product

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.000
This is a game in progress any bugs blah blah blah

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:18.000
So yeah we're gonna get

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000
Something for Legends 3

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.000
But yet you're gonna have to pay for it right?

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000
Let's see

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000
Quickly let me throw this out here

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.000
It's going on the eShop

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.000
Let me throw this out here to a little follow up to that

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.000
Is that you know I guess Capcom isn't

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
Really sold on this whole thing

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.000
So they are saying that we need

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.000
Interest we need participation

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000
From fans or this game could be axed

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.000
At any second like for some reason

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000
I'm just reminded of like when Tinkerbell

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000
Is dying clap if you want

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:48.000
To save me just clap clap louder

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000
Clap louder and say I believe in fairies

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000
I believe in fairies that's that's literally what

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000
Capcom is saying you need to clap

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000
And say I believe in Mega Man

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000
I believe in Mega Man and then give us your money

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.000
Is basically what they're saying so

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.000
They have come out and said in a blog post

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.000
On Capcom Unity Masakazu

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:06.000
Eguchi the director of the game

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000
Said the prototype version that's coming out

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:10.000
On the 3DS is based

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.000
On the prototype that they made

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.000
To prove to Capcom that the game could

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.000
Happen the heat and excitement surrounding

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.000
This downloadable title would determine

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000
Whether or not the full game could be greenlit

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.000
If hype is strong the full title

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:24.000
Will be a go if not

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:26.000
It's a no go

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:28.000
Clap clap I'm dying

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.000
I believe in fairies I believe

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000
This doesn't mention if there's

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.000
Going to be MSRP

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.000
Extra Mega Man costume $2

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.000
So if you want

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.000
Legends 3 if this thing

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.000
Costs money and it's basically a glorified

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000
Beta that's kind of lame

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000
Yeah pick it up

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000
They're tracking heavily the response to this

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.000
So now not only do we have pay to unlock

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.000
Content but we have pay demos

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.000
Pay to finish developing

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.000
You want us to fix those

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000
Clipping issues or you know

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:04.000
The game crashes if you try to

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.000
Walk backwards you know

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.000
Slip a little

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.000
Like a 20 we'll figure it out

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000
Alright

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:14.000
Well I guess to be fair the

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:16.000
Gran Turismo 5 prologue

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.000
Was kind of the same thing

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000
It kind of sounds like where this is going except we always knew

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000
There would be a Gran Turismo 5 eventually

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.000
Although was Bobby ever

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.000
Convinced that Gran Turismo 5 came out?

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000
I'm not sure hopefully he's in chat and can let us know

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000
Anyway a follow up to a story from a couple weeks ago

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000
I remember when there was that awesome Streets of Rage

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.000
Remake that they've been like making for like 8

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:36.000
Years and they put it out on the internet and we were

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.000
Talking about it how like hey they finally get

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.000
To put out the Streets of Rage remake you remember that

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000
Dark Sakura? Yeah

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000
Dark Sakura updated graphics well guess how long that

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.000
Lasted? 5 seconds

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:48.000
That's right the link

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000
Was taken down of course

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.000
Now that it's out on the internet it's not that hard to

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.000
Find but the official link was taken down

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.000
And after some proking and prodding they did

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.000
Admit Sega has contacted

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:00.000
Regarding the download hosted on this site

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:02.000
While this issue is being resolved

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:04.000
Please do not upload the game for others to download

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.000
Right any links posted on

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.000
This site will be removed thank you

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.000
Now apparently they were kind of

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.000
Asked well didn't you like try to get this cleared with

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.000
Sega or what's going on?

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:16.000
Bomberlink who's the project leader on the progress

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.000
Said they did contact Sega

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:20.000
I would like to say this is a quote from him

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:22.000
I would like to say that we did actually

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:24.000
Contact Sega last year through an email message

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:26.000
Regarding the use of copyrighted material

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:28.000
To which they answered asking us to send

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:30.000
A formal letter to their legal department

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:32.000
So that's what we did we accepted the ESA

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:34.000
Policies regarding the DMCA as well

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.000
Otherwise this website would not exist

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:38.000
Anymore

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.000
There you go

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:42.000
They had to take it down cause Sega didn't like it

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.000
Eight years that thing was in the making

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000
And you know Sega is just trying to really

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.000
Utilize that Streets of Rage license

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:50.000
Right now it's a big IP for them

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.000
A part of you know trademark

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000
Law is you have to pursue

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.000
Every infraction against

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:58.000
Your brand even if you're not doing anything

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:00.000
With it or else you could lose

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:02.000
The trademark to be fair

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.000
Because I'm sure someone in chat will bring it up

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000
They have released the Streets of Rage 2

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:08.000
Something on the iPhone, iPad

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.000
So they are still trying to cash in on

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:12.000
Genesis nostalgia as they have for the past

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.000
15 years on various

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:16.000
You know consoles and Streets of Rage was in that

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:18.000
Awesome like the best Genesis nostalgia

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:20.000
Of them all that Sonic Omega collection

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000
Thing that was on PS3 that's super

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:24.000
Cheap and Xbox

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:26.000
So yeah this isn't unfortunate to hear because

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:28.000
The community obviously really cares about it

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:30.000
And have to take eight years to put this out

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:32.000
But the fact that they were C&D'd is

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:34.000
Sort of I know seems like a duh

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:36.000
But do we mention

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:38.000
About the whole Sega building in San Francisco

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:40.000
Now belongs to Zynga

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:42.000
We did bring that up on the show huh

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.000
Speaking of sad stories

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:46.000
Sad sad stories

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:48.000
I didn't know Zynga owned

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.000
Words With Friends now either

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.000
Zynga's the

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:54.000
I stopped playing Words With Friends you know why

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.000
Because everybody wants to fucking play Words With Friends

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.000
And then it's like my phone keeps going off

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:00.000
Every two seconds

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:02.000
Your move with Dark Sakura

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:05.000
Random people you didn't know right

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.000
Were trying to start new games with you

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:09.000
Fuck Words With Friends

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.000
It's a terrible game

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:13.000
Yeah I said it

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:15.000
Get a Scrabble board you'll have more fun

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.000
Then you can yell at somebody in person

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.000
It's much more satisfying

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:21.000
Rather than Words With Friends play out

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:23.000
Everybody fucking cheats at Words With Friends anyway

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.000
You know there's an app that you can actually buy

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:29.000
One of my managers at work was showing me

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:31.000
How to do this by the way

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:33.000
A screenshot of the screen from Words With Friends

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:35.000
And then upload it to this other app

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:37.000
And it just cheats

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:39.000
When I was playing a lot of Yahoo

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:41.000
Literati

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:43.000
There was a JavaScript

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:45.000
Website that was in Anagram Finder

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:47.000
Where you would put in your

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:49.000
Yahoo Literati URL and it would say

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:51.000
Oh here's your word

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:53.000
You're a cheater?

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:55.000
You are a cheater?

01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:57.000
You cheated on Yahoo Literati?

01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:59.000
You're going to hell

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:01.000
I can however say that

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:03.000
I have not cheated at Scrabulous

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:05.000
I miss Scrabulous

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.000
What's Scrabulous?

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:09.000
Scrabulous became Lexulous because

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000
Scrabble or whatever

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.000
Is that on Facebook?

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:15.000
Ah fuck that game too

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:17.000
Well I don't play it on Facebook

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:19.000
But I used to play it when it was Scrabulous

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:21.000
And it had Scrabble Solitaire

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:23.000
Now it's like it makes you play with people

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:25.000
And I hate that because Scrabble Solitaire is super fun

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:27.000
Where basically you just play until you're out of words

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:29.000
That's your score

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:31.000
Are there any fun Facebook games right now?

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.000
I've been going in and deleting

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:35.000
Just about all of my apps

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.000
There's seriously nothing I play on Facebook

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.000
I got sick of Knights of the Clicky

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.000
I'm sure I have like 4 trillion blood points in Vampire Wars

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.000
That I haven't touched in 3 years

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:45.000
Knights of the Clicky haven't touched in 2 and a half, 3 months

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:47.000
I deleted it

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:49.000
I've deleted almost all of my games

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:51.000
I want to play the Civ game

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:53.000
That was the only thing I was interested in

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:55.000
Does that come out? I don't even remember

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:57.000
And then there's some

01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:59.000
Supposedly, and it's a story that didn't make our show roll tonight

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:01.000
But some music game is out on Facebook too

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:03.000
That I need to check out for next week

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:05.000
Something that was posted in our thread

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:07.000
About like a Facebook game, but I wanted to actually play it

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:09.000
Before bringing it up on the show

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:11.000
But apparently there's that too

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.000
So, alright

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:15.000
Cassandra in our chat room says

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:17.000
Scrabulous sounds like a Decepticon name

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:19.000
I like that

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.000
Alright, let's move on

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.000
DarkSakura, what do you got for us?

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.000
Well, there is

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000
An Activision memo that was linked

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:29.000
That says there is no

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.000
Appetite for Guitar Hero

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:33.000
Aww

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:35.000
It actually was saying is that

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:37.000
But there is an appetite for destruction

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:39.000
And there's also an

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:41.000
Aperitif for destruction

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:43.000
If you like, lounge against the machine

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:45.000
Anyway

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:47.000
Basically

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.000
The whole thing that they're saying is that

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:51.000
Yeah, right now it's dead

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:53.000
But it should

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:55.000
Eventually come back up

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:57.000
They're asking

01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:59.000
The CEO Eric

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.000
Hirschberg said

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:03.000
Why are we walking away from Guitar Hero

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:05.000
Instead of just trying to reinvent it

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.000
And that basically it's because

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:09.000
There are so many

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:11.000
High quality games that are just

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:13.000
Saturating the market

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:15.000
Wasn't this what we were saying before?

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:17.000
Is that the market was just way too saturated?

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:19.000
Well, they're like, oh, duh

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:21.000
That's what we were doing wrong

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:23.000
So

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:25.000
They're sort of

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:27.000
Setting it aside for now

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:29.000
In fact, it actually says that they are

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:31.000
Perhaps after a cooling period

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:33.000
We will revisit the franchise with fresh innovation

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:35.000
They're gonna wait for people to go

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:37.000
Remember when Guitar Hero was cool

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:39.000
And then Activision will be right there

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:41.000
To say, hey, we still own the rights to this

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:43.000
Hey, there's a whole new Guitar Hero game for you to play

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:45.000
Haha

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:47.000
It's retro Guitar Hero

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:49.000
Meanwhile, Rock Band's like, we've been out here and we're still cool

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:51.000
Hi, we're still cool

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:53.000
Hi, we're really cool

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:55.000
We've attached

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:57.000
The clarinet attachment

01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:59.000
Although I do, I even feel like the Rock Band

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:01.000
Thing has really died down

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:03.000
It's really died down

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:05.000
It's kinda sad

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:07.000
We were just playing the other day

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:09.000
The cousins were over when we were playing

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:11.000
SSJ100 Matt in our chat room says

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:13.000
Notice how no one ever asked these questions when

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:15.000
DDR died, in Konami that is

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:17.000
Well, technically DDR is

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:19.000
Still not dead

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:21.000
I mean, they are still cranking out those games

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:23.000
Like, wow, there's an Xbox 360

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:25.000
One coming out, the port of the

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:27.000
PlayStation 3 one is coming on the Xbox

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:29.000
360 and you guys, it uses the

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:31.000
Xbox Live Vision camera

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:33.000
That's how hip Konami is

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:35.000
The little webcam

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:37.000
Not the Kinect, but the little

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:39.000
AOL-looking thing

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:41.000
We'll use that, apparently

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:43.000
I hope to God for Konami's

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:45.000
Sake, the Kinect will stand in

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:47.000
For that, because the Kinect's

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:49.000
Basically a camera too, but

01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:51.000
I think the 360 only has the

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:53.000
One I.O. USB port in the back

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:55.000
For goodies, so you'd have to

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:57.000
Unplug your Kinect to plug in the little webcam

01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:59.000
That's not gonna happen

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:01.000
And if seriously

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:03.000
It only works with that little camera

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:05.000
And it doesn't work with Kinect, then everyone point and laugh

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:07.000
At Konami

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:09.000
Anyhow

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:11.000
Oh yeah, Guitar Hero, yeah

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:13.000
Well, someday it'll come out

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:15.000
It's being cryogenically frozen for a later date

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:17.000
So that they can bust it out in the future

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:19.000
To save humanity

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:21.000
It's next to Walt Disney's head

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:23.000
Alright

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:25.000
Moving on, so let's just pop

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:27.000
There was a story that we reported

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.000
On a few weeks ago about

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:31.000
Ratings tampering on the

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:33.000
Indie marketplace on the

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:35.000
XBLA

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:37.000
And some indie games

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:39.000
That had anywhere from three to five star reviews

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:41.000
Were getting hundreds

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:43.000
Of one star reviews

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:45.000
Within a short amount of time that was throwing

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:47.000
Their game listing

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:49.000
And their rankings down

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:51.000
Into the toilet so they weren't getting as much

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:53.000
Exposure as they would otherwise

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:55.000
If they had their four star review

02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:57.000
So, Microsoft decided

02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:59.000
To come up with a fix to this

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:01.000
And they have decided that

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:03.000
In order to

02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:05.000
Rate an indie game, you need to

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:07.000
Have a gold account, which means you are

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:09.000
Paying Microsoft

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:11.000
For the Xbox Gold

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:13.000
Live services, if you are a free or

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:15.000
Silver member, you cannot give

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:17.000
A rating to a game

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:19.000
An indie game

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:21.000
That's good, because it was probably a bunch of

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:23.000
Sock-free accounts that were doing this anyway

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:25.000
This story that I looked up

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:27.000
Also references a previous story

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:29.000
When the manipulation was first discovered

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:31.000
About a

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:33.000
Firm that had posted

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:35.000
To a contractor

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:37.000
Job site

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:39.000
Basically saying, we need someone

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:41.000
That can write a script that will generate

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:43.000
5,000 free silver

02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:45.000
Accounts

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:47.000
They were looking for a coder that's like, can we run this

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:49.000
Overnight and just get the username spit out to us

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:51.000
Doesn't necessarily say

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:53.000
Why they wanted those 5,000

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:55.000
Accounts or if it's even related to

02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:57.000
This

02:01:57.000 --> 02:01:59.000
Rating manipulation, but just as a coincidence

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:01.000
There are firms out there that are like

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:03.000
We want

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:05.000
Wow, if I was Microsoft

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:07.000
I would be bringing the smackdown

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:09.000
On these firms for abusing their network

02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:11.000
Yeah, I guess it was a

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:13.000
Graphic design firm contract

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:15.000
Script for 5,000 Xbox Live

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:17.000
Silver accounts

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:19.000
Again, don't know for sure, but the fact that

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:21.000
The interest for that is there

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:23.000
Microsoft's like, if you have a free account

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:25.000
You don't get to rate on indie games

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:27.000
Which, I guess, makes sense

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:29.000
That sucks that you have to pay, but it will

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:31.000
If you have a

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:33.000
Gold account, they can take action

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:35.000
Against you, they can ban your credit

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:37.000
Card, they can ban your account

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:39.000
You lose your gamer tag, you lose your achievement points

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:41.000
Why didn't they just

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:43.000
Make it so you have to actually play the game for 10 minutes

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:45.000
To rate? I mean, is that

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:47.000
So hard? I don't know

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:49.000
I guess that's hard to do

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:51.000
It's easy to build something to shut it off after 4 minutes

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:53.000
Oh, demo over 4 minutes, clank, buy

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:55.000
Or get out

02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:57.000
Can you buy indie games a la carte with a silver or do you need gold

02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:59.000
In order to even buy stuff on there

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:01.000
You can buy a la carte with silver

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:03.000
Yeah, I don't see why they would shove

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:05.000
It's money, why would you shut off a money maker?

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:07.000
I'm pretty sure

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:09.000
So, uh, and Randy

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:11.000
In our chatroom at chat.orangetonsrated.com

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:13.000
Agrees with me, they should make it so that you have to

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:15.000
Actually play a game for a set amount of time to rate it

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:17.000
That way people have to go out of their way to be jerks

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:19.000
At the same time, though, what's

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:21.000
To stop somebody from building a script that signs

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:23.000
In 5000 Xbox Live users into

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:25.000
A game? I mean, it's possible

02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:27.000
A botting thing could do it

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:29.000
Sad but true, somebody would figure it out

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:31.000
Yeah, I

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:33.000
I agree that you should

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:35.000
Be able to

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:37.000
Have to play the game before you can rate it

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:39.000
But at the same time

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:41.000
If I play a demo that is so

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:43.000
Bad

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:45.000
And I want to be able to warn people

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:47.000
That this demo was horrible

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:49.000
Like that maze with balloons?

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:51.000
Yeah, I'm not gonna

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:53.000
Pay the 300 space bucks

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:55.000
I think people should

02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:57.000
Download maze with balloons

02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:59.000
Just to see how freaking bad it is

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:01.000
It is like an old, you know what

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:03.000
Maze with balloons reminds me of?

02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:05.000
An old CD-ROM game from when that technology

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:07.000
First came out and people were like

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:09.000
Let's put softcore porn out

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:11.000
And try to make a game out of it

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:13.000
I'm thinking of the slumber party game

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:15.000
That that one girl was in from the

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:17.000
Night Trap

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:19.000
Yeah, it's like that

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:21.000
Exactly

02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:23.000
Alright, anyhow

02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:25.000
Let's move on to one other story

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:27.000
And I've kind of brought this up before

02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:29.000
So this is a bit of a duh

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:31.000
But Super Mario 3DS, of course it is going to be

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:33.000
Announced at E3

02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:35.000
Well, I mean, I guess it was announced

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:37.000
Quote-unquote at Game Developers Conference

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:39.000
But we're gonna get the official details

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:41.000
I guess you could say at E3

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:43.000
Apparently, though, according to an interview with

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:45.000
Edge, Miyamoto has leaked out a few details

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:47.000
On this

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:49.000
It's gonna have a combination of Super Mario Galaxy

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:51.000
And Super Mario 64

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:53.000
Two games that's still completely original

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:55.000
Perhaps that's because of the tanooki

02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:57.000
Or the raccoon suit, which we haven't seen in any

02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:59.000
Of those other games

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:01.000
That could be part of it as well

02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:03.000
Or maybe it'll just be kind of a mechanic about the story

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:05.000
Of the game or how it all kind of plays together

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:07.000
Maybe instead of, I would like to see this

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:09.000
In a Mario game, maybe I'm just, maybe a pipe dream

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:11.000
But a bump

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:13.000
But instead of all these broken up worlds

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:15.000
What about one massive world?

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:17.000
I'd like to see a Mario game like that

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:19.000
Yeah, like a sandbox Mario game

02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:21.000
That'd be awesome, actually

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:23.000
Imagine if the warp zones actually took you

02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:25.000
Places to other parts of this one giant world

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:27.000
Instead of a heavily fragmented

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:29.000
You know, now you're on Bee Planet

02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:31.000
Now you're on Candy Planet

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:33.000
I think that there should be, you know, things you have to do

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:35.000
To unlock different areas

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:37.000
Sure, just like any good Metroidvania

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:39.000
Type of game

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:41.000
You have to get an item to get behind the door

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:43.000
I would like to see that in a Mario game

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:45.000
That would be pretty awesome

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:47.000
That would be very awesome, we'll see what happens

02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:49.000
Let's see, Redertainment in our chatroom

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:51.000
I want to read this comment too, speaking of the whole demos

02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:53.000
And down ranking, chat.orangetownsradio.com

02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:55.000
Is of course where our chatroom is

02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:57.000
Redertainment says, if you want to warn people that a demo

02:05:57.000 --> 02:05:59.000
Sucks, I'm sure you have a Twitter account

02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:01.000
You can bitch on that reaches more people

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:03.000
Than that downloaded that indie title

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:07.000
And Randy says that Grand Theft Mario reminds him

02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:09.000
Of something that happened in Robot Chicken

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:11.000
I haven't seen

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:13.000
Every episode of Robot Chicken, so I guess that went over my head

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:15.000
Oops, I did see

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:17.000
The Final Fantasy VII fast food

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:19.000
That was great

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:21.000
Alright, let's get to the emails

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:23.000
Every week you guys send us emails

02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:25.000
At mailbag.orangetownsradio.com

02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:27.000
The mailbag has been rather thin the past few weeks

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:29.000
So I'm really happy that this week you guys

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:31.000
Have fucking blown it up

02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:33.000
Dark Soccer is going to work tonight

02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:35.000
Well, we got a request

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:37.000
From

02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:39.000
Ronnie

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:41.000
For an autograph

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:43.000
With an address, this is a five year listener

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:45.000
So I figured I was going to find

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:47.000
A postcard that I have

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:49.000
And we could just sign it and then put it in an envelope and send it

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:51.000
So I have one that says Juicyful

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:53.000
And it's orange

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:55.000
Either that or I was going to use the congratulations on your Bar Mitzvah

02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:57.000
Card

02:06:57.000 --> 02:06:59.000
That I got at the dollar store

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:01.000
For any upcoming Bar Mitzvah

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:03.000
Because there's a lot of kids

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:05.000
And I was like, no I better save that for an actual

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:07.000
Bar Mitzvah

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:09.000
So yeah, I set this aside

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:11.000
And we'll get everyone to sign it

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:13.000
So I mean, SalaciousPop I'm sure

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:15.000
Would not, his autograph would not

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:17.000
Go unappreciated, but I'm sure somebody wants

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:19.000
A complete trifecta of official OLR hosts

02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:21.000
Yeah, so

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:23.000
I just need to make sure that

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:25.000
I mark the right one

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:27.000
Yeah, don't click delete

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:29.000
I'm not deleting it

02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:31.000
There, it's this one, so I will

02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:33.000
Do unread, there we go

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:35.000
And moving forward

02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:37.000
This is from

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:39.000
Holly D. Hey guys

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:41.000
I swear your email was the above

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:43.000
But I recently heard you say mailbag at OrangeLaundryRadio.com

02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:45.000
Is the Gmail

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:47.000
One an old email or something?

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:49.000
I don't know, do we have a Gmail?

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:51.000
Do we have a Gmail? If we do

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:53.000
What's the

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:55.000
Sender's name? Holly

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:57.000
Is that the Holly that writes it to Hordhouse?

02:07:57.000 --> 02:07:59.000
Oh, it's probably the same Holly from Hordhouse

02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:01.000
That is a Gmail account

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:03.000
Yeah, that is a Gmail account

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:05.000
The email for Hordhouse is

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:07.000
HordhousePodcast at Gmail.com

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:09.000
OrangeLaundryRadio is mailbag at OrangeLaundryRadio.com

02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:11.000
I want to see if

02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:13.000
Maybe somebody's swiped it

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:15.000
I don't know, let me look

02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:17.000
So anywho, just wanted to confirm because I sent a couple of emails

02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:19.000
And I thought it was weird that Sucker kept saying you only had one or two emails

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:21.000
Maybe other people are confused like me

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:23.000
Thanks

02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:25.000
Yeah, it's

02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:27.000
You sent it to the right one now

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:29.000
So it's mailbag at OrangeLaundryRadio.com

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:31.000
Okay, hey

02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:33.000
OLR crew

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:35.000
AZHP here

02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:37.000
So if anyone at OLR has played the PS2 game

02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:39.000
Shin Megami Tensei Persona 4

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:41.000
But I wanted to share

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:43.000
The gaming related project that I've decided to take upon myself

02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:45.000
Persona 4 takes place in the year 2011

02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:47.000
From April 11th through the rest of the year

02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:49.000
That being the case, I've taken it upon myself

02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:51.000
To tweet the events of Persona 4

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:53.000
Roughly as they happen

02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:55.000
It's just a very deep game with lots of relationships

02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:57.000
Drama, mystery

02:08:57.000 --> 02:08:59.000
And just lots of things to do in general

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:01.000
And I'll try to make it as interesting and funny

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:03.000
To follow along with as possible

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:05.000
The Twitter account is

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:07.000
NarukamiU

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:11.000
That's N-A-R-U-K-M-I-Y-U

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:13.000
NarukamiU being the name of

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:15.000
Being, let me start over

02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:17.000
NarukamiU being the name

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:19.000
That the people developing the new Persona 4

02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:21.000
Anime have given the originally nameless

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:23.000
Main character

02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:25.000
I'm not looking to become some sort of D-list-y

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:27.000
Celebrity by doing this

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:29.000
But I do want people who would be appreciated

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:31.000
In this sort of project to know about it

02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:33.000
If you spread the word on your show

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:35.000
I would be deeply honored

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:37.000
Again the Twitter account is at NarukamiU

02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:39.000
Also happy birthday DarkSarka, thank you

02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:41.000
Your birthday is just a few days before mine

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:43.000
And mine is the day before Wendell's

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:45.000
So yours was yesterday, well happy birthday

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:47.000
Keep up the great work

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:49.000
And thanks so much for helping me spread the word

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:51.000
AZHP, and also a very big happy birthday

02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:53.000
To Mr. Wendell, thank you for reminding me to say so

02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:55.000
Cause Wendell is one of our old school buddies

02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:57.000
Happy birthday all y'all

02:09:57.000 --> 02:09:59.000
And glad you got that plug worked out

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:01.000
He's old

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:03.000
I just wanted to follow up

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:05.000
It does look like there is an Orange Lounge Radio

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:07.000
Email account at Gmail

02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:09.000
It is not us

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:11.000
I sent a password reset thing

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:13.000
So if it is one of us we'll get the email

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:15.000
But it's not in my email, it's not in my Orange Lounge Radio

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:17.000
It's not in the mailbag email

02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:19.000
Somebody else could have signed up trying to impersonate us

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:21.000
I certainly suppose that's possible

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:23.000
Loki could have it too

02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:27.000
He might have done that for the YouTube channel or something

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:29.000
But that's very possible

02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:31.000
So one of us will have the reset email if it's ours

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:33.000
But as far as we know right now, we don't own it

02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:35.000
I've got about six different emails and none of them are

02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:37.000
And we don't write from that address

02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:39.000
So if you do get something from OrangeLoungeRadio.com

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:43.000
Forward it to the official email of Orange Lounge Radio

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:45.000
Which is mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:47.000
So we can investigate

02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:49.000
And other than that, we're probably going to have to send a notice

02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:51.000
For them to strike it

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:53.000
It could be Loki

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:55.000
Loki could have done with the YouTube channel

02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:57.000
So we'll have to ask him next week

02:10:57.000 --> 02:10:59.000
Thanks for letting us know

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:01.000
Greetings, O.L.R. This week was torture without your podcast

02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:03.000
Don't ever take another week off again

02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:05.000
Even if Rob and Jamie have to go somewhere

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:07.000
I'll suck it up and just listen to Loki eat chicken

02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:09.000
And complain about Nintendo for three hours

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:11.000
Which is exactly what it would be

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:13.000
Peace and chicken grease serious turtle

02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:15.000
He's a very serious turtle

02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:17.000
Seriously, you're not allowed to leave

02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:19.000
Long email is long

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:21.000
I just want to point out

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:23.000
A lot of your favorite shows take all summer off

02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:27.000
We take one week off every three months or so

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:29.000
I think it's okay if we miss four shows a year

02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:31.000
We need a vacation sometimes

02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:33.000
That's right

02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:35.000
It felt really good to not have a show last week

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:37.000
I love doing the show

02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:39.000
Don't get me wrong, but it was kind of nice to have Sunday night

02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:41.000
To do something else

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:43.000
Usually when I take Sunday off

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:45.000
If it's not for family stuff

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:47.000
It's for doing something else for the show

02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:49.000
I've gone to gaming conventions

02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:51.000
And stuff called in and reported on it

02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:53.000
And sometimes, honestly, I wish I was here instead of there

02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:55.000
But, you know

02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:57.000
Because this is my house

02:11:57.000 --> 02:11:59.000
Okay

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:01.000
Hi, OLR, this is from Spazznator, by the way

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:03.000
I'm pretty sure that the three of you have covered the story

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:05.000
About PSN going down this week due to hackers

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:07.000
In part A of this week's show

02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:09.000
So I won't bother rehashing the details

02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:11.000
Rather, I'd like to do a Loki-style rant about it, if I may

02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:13.000
While I'm not pissed at Sony

02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:15.000
Hell, from what I can tell

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:17.000
They did what they needed to do

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:19.000
I am, however, extremely pissed off

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:21.000
Okay, dude, it's not hackers, okay

02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:23.000
But I will read your rant, anyway

02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:25.000
I am, however, EXTREMELY

02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:27.000
PISSED OFF

02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:29.000
At these fucktards that hacked PSN

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:31.000
Despite Sony not explicitly saying

02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:33.000
Who it was that did it

02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:35.000
I'm 100,000% sure

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:37.000
It was these anonymous dickwads that did it

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:39.000
After all, as the old saying goes

02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:41.000
If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck

02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:43.000
It must be a duck

02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:45.000
Who the holy hell are they to do this

02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:47.000
What the fuck gives them the right?

02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:49.000
They're a small minority

02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:51.000
Have other consoles to play online with

02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:53.000
Yes, there are single player games as well

02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:55.000
But that's besides the point

02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:57.000
There are games such as

02:12:57.000 --> 02:12:59.000
Mags, SOCOM, Confrontation Free Realms, DCUO, etc

02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:01.000
That are multiplayer only

02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:03.000
As well as a few Capcom titles

02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:05.000
I.e. Final Fight Double Impact

02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:07.000
And Bionic Commando Rearm 2

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:09.000
That require one to be logged into PSN to play

02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:11.000
Hence, right now, they're unplayable

02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:13.000
Many of those titles I play on a regular basis

02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:15.000
And tend to love

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:17.000
Just over the fact that, for the time being

02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:19.000
I can't access the PSN video store

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:21.000
To get either the freebies

02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:23.000
And or paid content

02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:25.000
And the three of you know how much I love that store

02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:27.000
Hell, as is, I will never shut up about it

02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:29.000
At any rate

02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:31.000
When Sony finds these torps

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:33.000
And they will, it's just a matter of time

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:35.000
I hope they get the legal system on their punk asses

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:37.000
Like white on motherfucking rice

02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:39.000
And, as Samuel Jackson so eloquently put it

02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:41.000
Gets Medivial on their asses

02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:43.000
May the hackers burn in a nuclear fire

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:45.000
Than drown an ocean of piss and acid

02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:47.000
Slash end rants

02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:49.000
It actually did exhales

02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:51.000
But I exhaled

02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:53.000
This rant is brought to you by one really pissed off PSN user

02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:55.000
That wants to lay the smack down on some punks

02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:57.000
By the way, your anger may be a little misdirected

02:13:57.000 --> 02:13:59.000
Wait until it's resolved

02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:01.000
An official word comes out

02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:03.000
I kind of agree

02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:05.000
With what you're saying, can I read this real quick from Bobby

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:07.000
In our chatroom too? DarkSakura

02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:09.000
Yeah, I kept telling him it wasn't anonymous and he told me I was wrong

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:11.000
He told me it didn't matter what the truth was

02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:13.000
I was going to blame Anon

02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:15.000
See, Anon was very proud

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:17.000
To take credit for that first Sony attack

02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:19.000
And that's the problem

02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:21.000
Is that now that this is happening, I mean

02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:23.000
This could be happening from somebody who's trying to get at Anonymous

02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:25.000
For all we know

02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:27.000
But Anonymous flat out said

02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:29.000
We understand that this tactic

02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:31.000
Only hurts the people we're trying to protect

02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:33.000
We are not going to do it anymore

02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:35.000
But

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:37.000
But because Anonymous has no leader

02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:39.000
You know, it's not like

02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:41.000
WikiLeaks who has that, whatever his name is

02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:43.000
They've got a group that's

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:45.000
But there's no clear leader out there

02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:47.000
And that's what's causing them

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:49.000
To look bad is because it could be

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:51.000
A subset that's doing it

02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:53.000
Regardless

02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:55.000
I don't think this is Anonymous

02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:57.000
I think they may benefit from the notoriety

02:14:57.000 --> 02:14:59.000
But

02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:01.000
I don't think this is Anonymous

02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:03.000
They flat out said

02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:05.000
No, this is counter productive

02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:07.000
To what we're trying to do

02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:09.000
So don't

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:11.000
Don't look for a scapegoat, wait until they actually

02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:13.000
Officially say what's going on, because I have a feeling

02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:15.000
That it's actually one of those situations

02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:17.000
Where, like, okay, at my work

02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:19.000
We got an email out that said

02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:21.000
This number of

02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:23.000
People are affected

02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:25.000
Because a laptop was stolen

02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:27.000
Who hacked

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:29.000
The

02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:31.000
Site that does all the

02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:33.000
Email campaigns?

02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:35.000
That happened about, what, two, three weeks ago

02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:37.000
Do you remember the salacious pop? You read a lot of internet news

02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:39.000
Somebody hacked, it wasn't Anonymous

02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:41.000
It was somebody else hacked some

02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:43.000
Spam, no, not spam, I'm sorry

02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:45.000
They do, like, the email campaigns for all these various

02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:47.000
Websites, and all

02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:49.000
These websites that use this email

02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:51.000
Service to maintain their mailing list and so forth had to

02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:53.000
Write people, because I got some from a couple

02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:55.000
Companies saying

02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:57.000
Your personal information may have been breached

02:15:57.000 --> 02:15:59.000
Your email and so forth, because we

02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:01.000
Got hacked. Oh, are you talking about

02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:03.000
The Gawker network, Kotaku?

02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:05.000
No, but there's that too

02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:07.000
So that wasn't Anonymous either

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:09.000
That wasn't Anonymous either. Somebody's out there

02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:11.000
Hacking for personal information

02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:13.000
Because maybe somebody in chat will, I'll ring a bell

02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:15.000
Somebody hacked Gawker

02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:17.000
Somebody hacked this email network to get

02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:19.000
All the emails and so forth

02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:21.000
I think it's them

02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:23.000
That's getting Sony. I think somebody went after

02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:25.000
That private information, it's Sony

02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:27.000
So, yeah, and this is

02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:29.000
What I have to say to you, is that

02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:31.000
When

02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:33.000
When you have a situation like this

02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:35.000
Where, yeah, you may have an easy person

02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:37.000
To place blame on

02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:39.000
Keep in mind that

02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:41.000
Wars have been started

02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:43.000
Over people putting the blame where there was

02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:45.000
On an innocent party, just because

02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:47.000
Of quote, circumstantial evidence

02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:49.000
Don't be one of those people

02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:51.000
Don't be a dick like that

02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:53.000
And also, with the DDS

02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:55.000
DDoS attack

02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:57.000
You know, you've got hundreds or thousands of computers

02:16:57.000 --> 02:16:59.000
That have been compromised in some way

02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:01.000
You're flooding the network with garbage

02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:03.000
It's very hard, because you've got all of these compromised

02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:05.000
Computers of just regular

02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:07.000
PC owners

02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:09.000
It's hard to

02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:11.000
As obnoxious as it is

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:13.000
It's very difficult

02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:15.000
It's not an actionable crime, is what I'm trying to say

02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:17.000
Because the computers are compromised

02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:19.000
If you're hacking into something

02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:21.000
And you're getting customer information

02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:23.000
Which hasn't been confirmed yet

02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:25.000
That's like a federal, that's serious

02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:27.000
And that's not their MO

02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:29.000
That's totally not their MO

02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:31.000
Keep in mind, all of the stuff that they've

02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:33.000
Been doing is basically forms

02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:35.000
Of vigilantism

02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:37.000
They have gone after people who

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:39.000
They have perceived have committed

02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:41.000
Some sort of crime that's

02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:43.000
Not being punished in the proper way

02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:45.000
And they are going after these people to make their lives

02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:47.000
Miserable

02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:49.000
Yeah, they'll waste some of your time and some of your money

02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:51.000
And then that's it, they'll get their plan across

02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:53.000
But when they've gone after people's information

02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:55.000
It's been specific people

02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:57.000
To have a specific thing happen

02:17:57.000 --> 02:17:59.000
I've got to read some of these comments in chat, they're piling up here

02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:01.000
In the true Easter spirit

02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:03.000
Redertainment says, the Jews did it

02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:05.000
Happy Easter

02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:07.000
Fuck that

02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:09.000
And fuck you

02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:11.000
DefectiveCandy in our chatroom says

02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:13.000
The Epsilon email hacking was supposedly

02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:15.000
Accomplished by one rogue individual

02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:17.000
Thank you, it's Epsilon

02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:19.000
Could be a former employee

02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:21.000
That's true

02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:23.000
SSJ100Matt says

02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:25.000
Blaming everything on 4chan

02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:27.000
I thought that was anonymous

02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:29.000
That's the home of anonymous

02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:31.000
So there you go

02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:33.000
I like what Cogito said

02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:35.000
I don't think Sony was a hack at all

02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:37.000
Someone lost the keys to the big Sony computer and they can't all get in

02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:39.000
Check the crayon boxes

02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:41.000
Get that leash out

02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:43.000
There's like a cat that unplugged the thing

02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:45.000
Meow

02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:47.000
I'm in your Sony hack in your store

02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:49.000
But seriously

02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:51.000
Look at everything

02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:53.000
Don't pick one convenient scapegoat

02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:55.000
That's just

02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:57.000
That's not very smart

02:18:57.000 --> 02:18:59.000
Next email

02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:01.000
Yay, happy sunshine

02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:03.000
Unicorns that shit rainbows that kill people

02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:05.000
Yay

02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:07.000
Dear peoples

02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:09.000
We're peoples

02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:11.000
Oh, it's Redertainment

02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:13.000
Like you, I've been following the recent PSN outages

02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:15.000
Since I started popping up on Wednesday night

02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:17.000
When I first discovered these outages

02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:19.000
I was frustrated

02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:21.000
Raged out and cursed to the love my neighbors thought I was killing someone

02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:23.000
Not kidding

02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:25.000
Anyway, in the process of following the story

02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:27.000
I found the story that I'm sure you covered

02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:29.000
Earlier on the show

02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:31.000
Uh

02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:33.000
Let me see what this is

02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:35.000
I think that's just

02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:37.000
Yeah, it's the same story we covered basically

02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:39.000
From another source

02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:41.000
Once I read the story, I became considerably less angry

02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:43.000
As I can understand that Sony taking actions like this

02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:45.000
In response to this threat to a point

02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:47.000
However, there is one part of the story that really concerns me

02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:49.000
This is

02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:51.000
In order to

02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:53.000
Verify the smooth and secure operation

02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:55.000
Of the services Sony pulled the plug

02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:57.000
On both services April 20th

02:19:57.000 --> 02:19:59.000
This sentence gives me an impression that this isn't

02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:01.000
A simple hacking job

02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:03.000
Given Sony's recent movements in relation to piracy

02:20:03.000 --> 02:20:05.000
I believe that this may be the nature of Sony

02:20:05.000 --> 02:20:07.000
Taking down PSN

02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:09.000
I believe someone figured out how to pirate games

02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:11.000
Distributed digitally

02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:13.000
Oh, this is a good idea

02:20:13.000 --> 02:20:15.000
Distributed digitally via PSN

02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:17.000
If any of these conclusions are wrong

02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:19.000
Also, why do I have to go through PSN

02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:21.000
Or live to access Hulu Plus or Netflix

02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:23.000
I mean, when I want to watch Hulu

02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:25.000
On my laptop, all I have to do is fire up my browser

02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:27.000
Go through my ISP

02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:29.000
To get to what I want to watch

02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:31.000
I don't have to go through my laptop's manufacturer

02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:33.000
Exclusive network to access things

02:20:33.000 --> 02:20:35.000
So I don't have to do it on home consoles

02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:37.000
Because they're evil

02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:39.000
Stay black, redertainment

02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:41.000
This message has been brought to you by the successor to Anonymous

02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:43.000
Who was actually responsible for PSN

02:20:43.000 --> 02:20:45.000
I wrote it down and it's totally unknown to the public

02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:47.000
Nyanya

02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:49.000
Sent from my iPad

02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:51.000
Actually, we do have a theory in the chat room

02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:53.000
On who might be to blame

02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:55.000
For all of this that's going on on the PlayStation network

02:20:55.000 --> 02:20:57.000
An interesting theory

02:20:57.000 --> 02:20:59.000
We need to know

02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:01.000
Play Canada

02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:03.000
Play Canada

02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:05.000
All their beady little eyes

02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:07.000
Clap their heads and roll their lives

02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:09.000
Play Canada

02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:11.000
Play Canada

02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:13.000
We need to form a full assault

02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:15.000
Yep, it's all Canada's fault

02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:17.000
Actually, we should blame SkyNet

02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:19.000
We did survive Judgment Day

02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:21.000
We did

02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:23.000
In response to that email about why you have to authenticate

02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:25.000
With the console before you can use Netflix and Hulu

02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:27.000
For Netflix and Hulu

02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:29.000
To allow a third party appliance

02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:31.000
To run their service

02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:33.000
There needs to be some sort of accountability

02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:35.000
So that someone doesn't get an $8 Netflix account

02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:37.000
Give their username and password to their 40 friends

02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:39.000
That have a PlayStation 3

02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:41.000
And have them all

02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:43.000
Running Netflix off the one account

02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:45.000
So I think

02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:47.000
By authenticating into PSN

02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:49.000
It's saying

02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:51.000
This PSN account with this

02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:53.000
PlayStation 3 ID is using this Netflix

02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:55.000
And there's a sync there

02:21:55.000 --> 02:21:57.000
And that's why they do it

02:21:57.000 --> 02:21:59.000
However, it does not stop people from sharing Netflix accounts over the internet

02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:01.000
Black Wolf says that Netflix will still work

02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:03.000
You just gotta keep trying to log in

02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:05.000
Three to five times, you can get in eventually

02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:07.000
I haven't tried on PS3

02:22:07.000 --> 02:22:09.000
I've just been

02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:11.000
Playing Portal

02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:13.000
Offline

02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:15.000
Addict

02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:17.000
Like it's a bad thing to be addicted to Portal

02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:19.000
You can get down with that one

02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:21.000
Totally

02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:23.000
Okay

02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:25.000
Hey OLR, I hope the move went well for you Rob

02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:27.000
While you were busy with that, I was busy playing Portal 2

02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:31.000
That game has some of the best writing in anything, period

02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:33.000
Me too, Salacious Pop, unpack that box

02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:35.000
I'm gonna play Portal

02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:37.000
Let alone video games

02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:39.000
It certainly puts out

02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:41.000
What's out there to shame

02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:43.000
For some reason I thought of you Rob when I saw this article

02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:45.000
Okay, I have to look at this

02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:47.000
Uh oh

02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:49.000
It's still loading

02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:51.000
There's gonna be huge spoilers

02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:53.000
And you're gonna freak out

02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:55.000
Kagura director thought of Nintendo 3DS

02:22:55.000 --> 02:22:57.000
3D brushed 30 seconds later

02:22:57.000 --> 02:22:59.000
Hey man

02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:01.000
There's a guy who did

02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:03.000
Half minute hero

02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:05.000
I'm telling you

02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:07.000
Didn't I talk about that on the show

02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:09.000
In the 3DS we were talking about

02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:11.000
They just need a game that's boobs, boobs and more boobs

02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:13.000
Boobs in 3D, big boobs

02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:15.000
Little boobs, black boobs, white boobs

02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:17.000
All boobs, big

02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:19.000
Boobs with big nips

02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:21.000
Boobs with small nips, all types

02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:24.000
United Nations of boobs

02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:26.000
Coming soon on the 3DS

02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:28.000
I don't know if you've ever heard of this before

02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:30.000
But for the last few years there's been a convention

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:32.000
Dedicated to the world's favorite hedgehog

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:34.000
Held in London, Summer of Sonic

02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:36.000
They usually have early previews

02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:38.000
Of coming games and occasionally

02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:40.000
Panels slash Q&As with developers

02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:42.000
As well as writers for the old UK comic

02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:45.000
And I hear this year for the US comics too

02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:47.000
This year's is on July 25th if anyone's interested

02:23:47.000 --> 02:23:49.000
I would love to go

02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:51.000
Somebody get me to Europe

02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:53.000
Hear you later, Catastrophic Moggy

02:23:53.000 --> 02:23:55.000
P.S. I'm really excited

02:23:55.000 --> 02:23:57.000
About the announcement of the Persona 4 anime

02:23:57.000 --> 02:23:59.000
P.P.S. Hey Jamie, have you seen

02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:01.000
The new episode of Doctor Who yet?

02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:03.000
Every time someone does the colon P

02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:05.000
I do, yes I saw it

02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:07.000
And it was amazing

02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:09.000
And then I was really pissed off at the end

02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:11.000
And then I saw the preview for the next episode

02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:13.000
So I wasn't just pissed off

02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:15.000
I actually did pause it one time and go

02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:17.000
That is bullshit!

02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:19.000
And then kept watching

02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:21.000
As I understand

02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:23.000
I'm not the only person that did that

02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:25.000
Do I do that when I watch TV?

02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:27.000
Yell back at the TV?

02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:29.000
I downloaded it

02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:31.000
Sometimes when I watch Survivor

02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:33.000
I go, oh no he didn't!

02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:35.000
That's about as bad as I get

02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:37.000
You talk during WoW when something bad happens

02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:39.000
I do talk during WoW

02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:41.000
Thank god Ventrilo

02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:43.000
Isn't always on, let's just say that much

02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:45.000
Why do you think I don't log into Ventrilo

02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:47.000
That often?

02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:49.000
Because Dan is usually sitting right where you're sitting Alan

02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:51.000
Looking over at me like

02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:53.000
You really, really get

02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:55.000
Dirty mouth when you play this game

02:24:55.000 --> 02:24:57.000
I was like, bitches

02:24:57.000 --> 02:24:59.000
So yeah

02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:01.000
And sometimes

02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:03.000
Rob will sign into Vent and just be like

02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:05.000
Oh, hey what's going on?

02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:07.000
And I'll be sitting right next to him and I'm like, I'm fine

02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:09.000
I'm reading, oh no they didn't

02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:11.000
He's like, I'm on Vent, duh

02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:13.000
I don't know your life

02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:15.000
Yeah

02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:17.000
Alright, is that it for emails?

02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:19.000
That is it

02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:21.000
We need more emails for next week

02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:23.000
We need to beat the emails we had this week

02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:25.000
I want Dark Soccer's email bag to take like an hour next week

02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:27.000
Mailbag?

02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:29.000
Hey, if this happens, okay if we get

02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:31.000
If we break 10 emails

02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:33.000
Next week, you have to get me tacos

02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:35.000
I'm gonna get you tacos?

02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:37.000
Fine

02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:39.000
Fine

02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:41.000
We get more than 10 emails next week

02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:43.000
Not all from the same address

02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:45.000
Not all from the same address

02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:47.000
Unique, real emails

02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:49.000
That are at least a paragraph in length

02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:51.000
And with good grammar

02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:53.000
3-4 sentences with proper grammar

02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:55.000
Rob will buy me tacos

02:25:55.000 --> 02:25:57.000
Or pink berry

02:25:57.000 --> 02:25:59.000
Taco flavored pink berry

02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:01.000
They're gonna be from emails

02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:03.000
Like, you know, ShermyCat

02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:05.000
Or this is totally not Dan

02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:07.000
Hey mom, I pooped in the kitchen again

02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:09.000
Love your cat

02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:11.000
Number one Dan fan at Gmail

02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:13.000
You should have Dan on more often

02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:15.000
P.S. Bart

02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:17.000
We should get like a taco tote board

02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:19.000
And like show how many emails we've got during the week

02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:21.000
And then be like, let's see if Jamie's gonna get tacos

02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:23.000
Oh, we're at seven emails

02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:25.000
So far this week

02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:27.000
No taco for Jamie

02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:29.000
Can we install that on the website?

02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:31.000
The taco meter

02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:33.000
The taco meter

02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:35.000
Taco Tuesday is an official holiday

02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:37.000
Every week

02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:39.000
Black Wolf says, can I write a paragraph about how tasty the tacos would be?

02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:43.000
Yes, you can

02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:45.000
I will accept emails about tacos

02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:47.000
Cause tacos are amazing

02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:49.000
Or, you know, you can also do it about taco

02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:51.000
Which is octopus

02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:53.000
I love takoyaki

02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:55.000
Or you could write a dissertation about the 80s song

02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:57.000
Putting on the Ritz by Taco

02:26:57.000 --> 02:26:59.000
No

02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:01.000
It has to be video game related

02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:03.000
Delicious, crispy taco related

02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:05.000
Or tostadas I take those too

02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:07.000
For fuck's sake, can we move on to another topic?

02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:09.000
Taco

02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:11.000
Okay

02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:13.000
Alright, if you want to send us an email, of course, mailbag at orangelaundry.com

02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:15.000
This is the part of the show where we get angsty

02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:35.000
It's the FUs of the week segment

02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:37.000
Dark Sakura

02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:39.000
My FU goes to being really hungry right now

02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:41.000
Because over the last whole week I've maybe had

02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:43.000
At most

02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:45.000
100 calories a day

02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:47.000
Because I haven't really been able

02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:49.000
To keep anything down

02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:51.000
By the way, that candle came from the dollar store

02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:53.000
Does it? That smells nice

02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:55.000
I'm gonna have to raid the dollar tree

02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:57.000
It's a pumpkin bread

02:27:57.000 --> 02:27:59.000
Yeah, I love them, anyway

02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:01.000
So, I haven't been able to eat anything

02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:03.000
So now today is our annual Easter brunch

02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:05.000
And my appetite came back with a vengeance

02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:07.000
And now I'm super hungry

02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:09.000
Like, I think that's why I'm thinking about tacos

02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:11.000
Because I seriously haven't eaten

02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:13.000
Since 10 this morning

02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:15.000
No, about 10.30 this morning

02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:17.000
And then I came home and took a nap

02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:19.000
And I'm freaking hungry

02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:21.000
I ate matzo when I woke up

02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:23.000
And I normally do not like matzo by itself

02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:25.000
I ate some

02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:27.000
I want food

02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:29.000
I want a salad

02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:31.000
Actually, what I want is pinkberry, but it probably closed

02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:33.000
Yeah, the whole Easter thing

02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:35.000
Kind of makes places close

02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:37.000
But I heart to you

02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:39.000
From my wonderful coffee

02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:41.000
Oh, you're welcome

02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:43.000
Which is why I have someone from Lertness

02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:45.000
Folks don't know, but a lot of times before the show

02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:47.000
I do make a Starbucks rhyme

02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:49.000
There's Starbucks everywhere

02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:51.000
Like, saying there's one not far from Jamie's house

02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:53.000
Is like, you know, gee, there's grass in the backyard

02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:55.000
But yeah, there's a Starbucks nearby

02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:57.000
I tend to get coffee a lot

02:28:57.000 --> 02:28:59.000
I'm actually

02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:01.000
I'm actually going to decaf

02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:03.000
If I have it at night, it's gonna be decaf

02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:05.000
Yeah, I did request a decaf

02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:07.000
I'll remember that in the future

02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:09.000
Do you have any FUs for this week?

02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:11.000
Just, uh

02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:13.000
Not being completely 100% done

02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:15.000
With my old place

02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:17.000
I'm happy for my former roommate

02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:19.000
Because he found someone to move in with him

02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:21.000
But just that

02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:23.000
Having to go back to San Francisco one last time

02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:25.000
And just unpacking in general

02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:27.000
Is obnoxious

02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:29.000
Otherwise, that's all

02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:31.000
Pretty minor

02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:33.000
Yeah, I don't have a lot to be angsty about

02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:35.000
I mean, there's a lot of really good stuff going on for me right now

02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:37.000
A lot of, like, happy news

02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:39.000
I don't want to make you par for nothing

02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:41.000
But it's good stuff

02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:43.000
I will say FU to that freakin' headache I had earlier

02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:45.000
That was almost migraine status

02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:47.000
I would say, like, if headaches

02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:49.000
Were on, like, the terrorism

02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:51.000
Color chart

02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:53.000
I would say the headache I had was code orange

02:29:53.000 --> 02:29:55.000
It was pretty bad

02:29:55.000 --> 02:29:57.000
But it wasn't, like, really bad

02:29:57.000 --> 02:29:59.000
So, there you go

02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:01.000
Alright, that does it for the FUs of the week

02:30:01.000 --> 02:30:03.000
For now

02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:05.000
I think Wolf is pointing out in our chatroom

02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:07.000
That apparently Taco Bell has a lame Flash game

02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:09.000
Called Taco Fu

02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:11.000
At TacoBell.com slash TacoFu

02:30:11.000 --> 02:30:13.000
That's okay

02:30:13.000 --> 02:30:15.000
Way to merge the worlds of tacos and video games

02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:17.000
Just want to give an A plus to Bobby

02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:19.000
That's why he has his own show, folks

02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:21.000
Burger King's, uh, Reigning

02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:23.000
Dude, those, like, Sneak King and shit

02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:25.000
Those games were awesome

02:30:25.000 --> 02:30:27.000
Like, why? Like, for five bucks, they were great

02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:29.000
Why? Why didn't they ever do that again?

02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:31.000
They should do an update

02:30:31.000 --> 02:30:33.000
They should do Burger Time and call it Taco Time

02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:35.000
Weren't they supposed to do something with, uh, Kinect, I thought?

02:30:35.000 --> 02:30:37.000
I think they are making a new

02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:39.000
But they should do Taco Time

02:30:39.000 --> 02:30:41.000
They are making a new Burger Time

02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:43.000
It should be Taco Time

02:30:43.000 --> 02:30:45.000
Okay, how about Choco Taco Time?

02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:47.000
The villain that tries to, um, kill you

02:30:47.000 --> 02:30:49.000
In Taco Time is the diarrhea monster

02:30:49.000 --> 02:30:51.000
It's Montezuma

02:30:51.000 --> 02:30:53.000
Wow, you guys are mature

02:30:53.000 --> 02:30:55.000
Alright, two more stories

02:30:55.000 --> 02:30:57.000
Then we're gonna get to the phones

02:30:57.000 --> 02:30:59.000
Two more news stories

02:30:59.000 --> 02:31:01.000
So, uh, Salacious Pop

02:31:01.000 --> 02:31:03.000
Okay, so

02:31:03.000 --> 02:31:05.000
Ubisoft is developing

02:31:05.000 --> 02:31:07.000
A guitar game

02:31:07.000 --> 02:31:09.000
It seems like maybe they'd be a little

02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:11.000
That train has left the station

02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:13.000
Perhaps, but, uh, they're working on a game

02:31:13.000 --> 02:31:15.000
Called Rocksmith

02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:17.000
Which sounds a lot like, uh, Pro Mode

02:31:17.000 --> 02:31:19.000
In Rock Band

02:31:19.000 --> 02:31:21.000
Except with a guitar

02:31:21.000 --> 02:31:23.000
You can play this game with real guitars

02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:25.000
And the

02:31:25.000 --> 02:31:27.000
The UI and how the notes

02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:29.000
Because you know how, um, DJ Hero

02:31:29.000 --> 02:31:31.000
Guitar Hero Rock Band has the, uh,

02:31:31.000 --> 02:31:33.000
The note highway that scrolls

02:31:33.000 --> 02:31:35.000
Vertically

02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:37.000
This one uses more of a

02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:39.000
3D plane where you're in front

02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:41.000
And you see the notes coming from the back of the screen

02:31:41.000 --> 02:31:43.000
Moving towards you

02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:45.000
Um, so it looks really complicated

02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:47.000
I'm not sure how much of a market there might be for this

02:31:47.000 --> 02:31:49.000
But anyway, they are demoing the game

02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:51.000
At South by Southwest

02:31:51.000 --> 02:31:53.000
In Texas

02:31:53.000 --> 02:31:55.000
Which is a

02:31:55.000 --> 02:31:57.000
It's a music and movies

02:31:57.000 --> 02:31:59.000
It's kind of like a hipster-y

02:31:59.000 --> 02:32:01.000
I know, I was like, if you want to find a place where all the hipsters are at

02:32:01.000 --> 02:32:03.000
At one time, like, that's not

02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:05.000
Tumblr

02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:07.000
Yeah, but it's not like a Lollapalooza

02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:09.000
There are a lot of great bands there, but it's also

02:32:09.000 --> 02:32:11.000
Movies and art, and it's a whole pop culture thing

02:32:11.000 --> 02:32:13.000
So yeah, Rocksmith is going to be

02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:15.000
At South by Southwest, they're going to have musicians

02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:17.000
Play it, and just show it off

02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:19.000
I think they've got a whole Rocksmith tour bus

02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:21.000
That sets up

02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:23.000
Bass, and it's going to be at

02:32:23.000 --> 02:32:25.000
South by Southwest

02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:27.000
Yeah, I like the way they've done that

02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:29.000
Where they have the guitar silhouette in front

02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:31.000
Of the falling stream of notes

02:32:31.000 --> 02:32:33.000
It's kind of a neat little way to do it

02:32:33.000 --> 02:32:35.000
Alright, we'll see if this game can actually

02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:37.000
Be successful, kind of break the recent curse

02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:39.000
Of music games

02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:41.000
We'll see

02:32:41.000 --> 02:32:43.000
One more story for you guys

02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:45.000
Everybody get out your 40s and get ready to pour it

02:32:45.000 --> 02:32:47.000
The PSP Go

02:32:47.000 --> 02:32:49.000
Is officially dead

02:32:49.000 --> 02:32:51.000
That's right folks, pour out the 40s

02:32:51.000 --> 02:32:53.000
Devastated

02:32:53.000 --> 02:32:55.000
How did this happen?

02:32:55.000 --> 02:32:57.000
This is, I don't understand

02:32:57.000 --> 02:32:59.000
Apparently the whole thing

02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:01.000
Is started by a Sony shop employee

02:33:01.000 --> 02:33:03.000
Saying that the store was not going to get

02:33:03.000 --> 02:33:05.000
Any more shipments, and then the PSP

02:33:05.000 --> 02:33:07.000
Go disappeared from the Sony store

02:33:07.000 --> 02:33:09.000
Page, Sony is not confirming

02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:11.000
The news, but in their

02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:13.000
Statement, they're kind of trying to say, well why

02:33:13.000 --> 02:33:15.000
Are you asking about the Go? Shouldn't we be talking

02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:17.000
About the NGP? The awesome

02:33:17.000 --> 02:33:19.000
News system coming out from Sony?

02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:21.000
Yeah, so

02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:23.000
Although Sony hasn't confirmed it

02:33:23.000 --> 02:33:25.000
They haven't really denied it either

02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:27.000
In the UK as well, the PSP

02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:29.000
Go production has ceased, that has been proven

02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:31.000
So the PSP Go

02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:33.000
It's dead

02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:35.000
So it's basically become the sort of

02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:37.000
The

02:33:37.000 --> 02:33:39.000
The cousin that is

02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:41.000
Touched in the head that now lives in the attic

02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:43.000
That the family doesn't talk about

02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:45.000
Those thuds that you hear, we don't know

02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:47.000
No, he died when he was

02:33:47.000 --> 02:33:49.000
Born, we don't know who that is

02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:51.000
Some of the comments from our chatroom, of course the

02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:53.000
Raging comedy club that is the Orange Lounge Radio

02:33:53.000 --> 02:33:55.000
Chatroom, Frisbee calls it the

02:33:55.000 --> 02:33:57.000
PSP Go away

02:33:57.000 --> 02:33:59.000
Let's see, Redertainment says, wait, the PSP

02:33:59.000 --> 02:34:01.000
Go wasn't already dead?

02:34:01.000 --> 02:34:03.000
AlphaCanandagram says, wait, wasn't this debunked

02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:05.000
Saying only Europe isn't going to carry it and

02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:07.000
US is still going to have them?

02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:09.000
Dude

02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:11.000
It's going to go

02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:13.000
Sorry

02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:15.000
There you go, BlackWolf would like you to know that

02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:17.000
South by Southwest was actually last month

02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:19.000
So we're a little behind on the news apparently

02:34:19.000 --> 02:34:21.000
But that's where all the video was from

02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:23.000
I believe, I think it's just being compiled

02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:25.000
And put on the internet now

02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:27.000
So there you go

02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:29.000
Alright

02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:31.000
Shall we open up the Skype line?

02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:33.000
Yeah, let's do it

02:34:33.000 --> 02:34:35.000
1877 GameOLR

02:34:35.000 --> 02:34:37.000
Our username in Skype is Orange Lounge Radio

02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:39.000
Now earlier in the evening

02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:41.000
Bobby had a problem seeing us

02:34:41.000 --> 02:34:43.000
On Skype, but we assure you we're on

02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:45.000
And I see plenty of our regular callers

02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:47.000
Signing into Skype right now, so I'm assuming

02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:49.000
It's fine, but I assure you we

02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:51.000
Are on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio

02:34:51.000 --> 02:34:53.000
If you aren't down with that though, you can always call

02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:55.000
Our toll-free number, 1877

02:34:55.000 --> 02:34:57.000
GameOLR

02:34:57.000 --> 02:34:59.000
Of course, this is usually the part of the show where

02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:01.000
I'd ask Loki if he has any last minute stories

02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:03.000
He's not here

02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:05.000
And I didn't tell anyone else to prep for that

02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:06.000
Way to plan

02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:07.000
I have a story

02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:08.000
What's that?

02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:10.000
Taco

02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:12.000
Give me

02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:14.000
Alright, let's just go to the phones

02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:16.000
They're already ringing, thank god

02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:18.000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:20.000
It's Legend of Zaku

02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:22.000
Hey, Legend of Zaku, what's on your mind buddy?

02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:24.000
Nothing much, just like chilling in my room

02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:26.000
Fixing other people's PCs

02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:28.000
Resting up for tomorrow's work day

02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:30.000
What's tomorrow? Oh, work? Back to the grind?

02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:32.000
Yeah, back to the grind

02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:34.000
The evil grind

02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:36.000
Evil post-Easter grind

02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:38.000
You want to talk about something from our show?

02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:40.000
Or some other stories that didn't come?

02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:42.000
Folks at Gearbox have been really good sports recently

02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:44.000
With that proposal that they did

02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:46.000
You know, that Borderlands proposal

02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:48.000
That they did for this fan

02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:50.000
Out in Texas

02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:52.000
I have the video where

02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:54.000
I think Claptrap, actually

02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:56.000
The voice of Claptrap

02:35:56.000 --> 02:35:58.000
They put up a video using that

02:35:58.000 --> 02:36:00.000
As a way to propose to a girl

02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:02.000
Just pull it up right now

02:36:02.000 --> 02:36:04.000
Yeah, we did cover it at the top of the

02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:06.000
Show, or at the top of the segment

02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:08.000
Just so you know, you missed it

02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:10.000
We did talk about it

02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:12.000
What did you think about it?

02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:14.000
It's pretty good that Gearbox of all companies

02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:16.000
Is pretty much playing the Valve card

02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:18.000
And giving their fans

02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:20.000
Pulling all those stops for their fans

02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:22.000
Why do you say Gearbox of all companies?

02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:24.000
The way you phrase that is very interesting

02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:26.000
Do you think Gearbox is trying to be Valve?

02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:28.000
Gearbox, you know

02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:30.000
One of many

02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:32.000
Of all the other companies out there

02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:34.000
Gearbox is also

02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:36.000
Using that same

02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:38.000
Basically playing that same Valve card

02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:40.000
You wouldn't see Sony

02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:42.000
Or Activision pull that

02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:44.000
Pull those stunts

02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:46.000
You wouldn't even flip over

02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:48.000
For any fans that still want

02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:50.000
DJ Hero

02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:52.000
I would say Gearbox's shining achievement

02:36:52.000 --> 02:36:54.000
Is that they are actually going to fucking put out

02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:56.000
Duke Nukem forever

02:36:56.000 --> 02:36:58.000
That is how history will smile

02:36:58.000 --> 02:37:00.000
Upon them fondly

02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:02.000
Unless the game is the most atrocious piece of shit

02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:04.000
We've ever played

02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:06.000
It's not that bad

02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:08.000
Even though you do mention

02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:10.000
Shit in that sentence

02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:12.000
You do know you could actually use

02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:14.000
Excrement as a weapon in that game

02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:16.000
Hooray, I'm so excited

02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:18.000
Yes, you could actually

02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:20.000
Shit bomb people in that game

02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:22.000
I've always wanted to fling my poo in a video game

02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:24.000
Where I wasn't playing as a monkey

02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:26.000
I'm

02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:28.000
I'm touched

02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:30.000
Just a while ago I actually seen the video

02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:32.000
And yeah

02:37:32.000 --> 02:37:34.000
I know it's shocking

02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:36.000
Right now I'm just trying to gather up

02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:38.000
Just trying to see what I can

02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:40.000
What I can get right now

02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:42.000
In terms of games

02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:44.000
I know Mortal Kombat is on my list right now

02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:46.000
Since it was either that or

02:37:46.000 --> 02:37:48.000
Marvel vs. Capcom 3

02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:50.000
But after seeing the fatalities

02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:52.000
A week before they got

02:37:52.000 --> 02:37:54.000
Before it launched

02:37:54.000 --> 02:37:56.000
That pretty much convinced me at that point

02:37:56.000 --> 02:37:58.000
It's either that

02:37:58.000 --> 02:38:00.000
I mean, it's that and L.A. Noire

02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:02.000
Spring

02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:04.000
We're approaching some busy times

02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:06.000
I think the busy time

02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:08.000
Was this past week

02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:10.000
Something that didn't even freaking occur to me

02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:12.000
Is that this week

02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:14.000
And the next week depending on where you live

02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:16.000
Is Spring Break

02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:18.000
Usually it's either the week before or the week after Easter

02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:20.000
Is Spring Break

02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:22.000
So these games coming out

02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:24.000
Like so many all at once

02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:26.000
Is not a surprise

02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:28.000
PlayStation 3 Network going down for 5 days

02:38:28.000 --> 02:38:30.000
That is a little bit more of a surprise

02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:32.000
Hence why I think what's happening over there

02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:34.000
Is really bad

02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:36.000
What in Japan or getting hammered

02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:38.000
By Anonymous?

02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:40.000
I don't think this is a simple

02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:42.000
DDOS from Anonymous

02:38:42.000 --> 02:38:44.000
Again earlier in the show

02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:46.000
I'm pretty sure they cracked open

02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:48.000
One of their holes

02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:50.000
I don't think this is

02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:52.000
I think this is somebody who's done something

02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:54.000
A lot more serious than DDOS

02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:56.000
I think personal information has been compromised

02:38:56.000 --> 02:38:58.000
I think there's going to be more to develop on this

02:38:58.000 --> 02:39:00.000
Again I could be talking out my butt

02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:02.000
That's fine I'm some schmo with a podcast on the internet

02:39:02.000 --> 02:39:04.000
But when Sony isn't being up front

02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:06.000
I'm left to speculate

02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:08.000
Sony is basically acting like any other

02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:10.000
Japanese person would

02:39:10.000 --> 02:39:12.000
By not revealing any damning information

02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:14.000
You know at the moment

02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:16.000
They're trying to make it seem

02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:18.000
I don't know if I'd say that but okay

02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:20.000
I mean as I said

02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:22.000
You could draw parallels to the way

02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:24.000
Japan handled the whole

02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:26.000
Nuclear reactor crisis

02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:28.000
The way they were with that power company

02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:30.000
Aren't we getting a little

02:39:30.000 --> 02:39:32.000
Okay isn't this a little

02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:34.000
Tinfoil hat

02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:36.000
No it's like any government

02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:38.000
The Japanese are very

02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:40.000
They're open about it

02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:42.000
They're basically

02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:44.000
They openly lie to people

02:39:44.000 --> 02:39:46.000
So that way they can look good

02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:48.000
Not necessarily panic

02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:50.000
Because would you rather

02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:52.000
Hear from Sony that personal information

02:39:52.000 --> 02:39:54.000
Has been compromised now

02:39:54.000 --> 02:39:56.000
And then you're going to have people bitching in the forums

02:39:56.000 --> 02:39:58.000
And everywhere else and congress getting involved

02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:00.000
Or would you rather have that later on

02:40:00.000 --> 02:40:02.000
When it's less of a problem

02:40:02.000 --> 02:40:04.000
And they're actually back online

02:40:04.000 --> 02:40:06.000
I would rather have it now

02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:08.000
Because it's my fucking information

02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:10.000
Well that's up to Sony to decide

02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:12.000
They personally have it in their possession

02:40:12.000 --> 02:40:14.000
You gave it to them as a contract

02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:16.000
Of which you know to join PSN

02:40:16.000 --> 02:40:18.000
So it's not like you can get it

02:40:18.000 --> 02:40:22.000
Back somehow

02:40:22.000 --> 02:40:24.000
But you have to realize that

02:40:24.000 --> 02:40:26.000
I'm pretty certain it's a lot worse than

02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:28.000
What they're actually going to say

02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:30.000
They don't want to create panic

02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:32.000
Or else that's going to hurt their stock

02:40:32.000 --> 02:40:34.000
That's going to hurt their reputation

02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:36.000
What about their legal obligation

02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:38.000
From doing business in the state of California

02:40:38.000 --> 02:40:40.000
And the United States

02:40:40.000 --> 02:40:42.000
Where they are an entity

02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:44.000
We've already had the whole

02:40:44.000 --> 02:40:46.000
They are a California company

02:40:46.000 --> 02:40:48.000
Has been established before

02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:50.000
And they are going to have to disclose

02:40:50.000 --> 02:40:52.000
If personal information has been compromised

02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:54.000
They have to

02:40:54.000 --> 02:40:56.000
And that's all part of the panic

02:40:56.000 --> 02:40:58.000
If they say that

02:40:58.000 --> 02:41:00.000
If they say that now

02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:02.000
Unless they find a way to do damage control

02:41:02.000 --> 02:41:04.000
Then it's going to sink

02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:06.000
Their stock pretty fast

02:41:06.000 --> 02:41:08.000
Unless they find a way to

02:41:08.000 --> 02:41:10.000
To say it in a way

02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:12.000
Where it's not that big of a threat

02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:14.000
Even though it actually is

02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:16.000
But that's the whole point

02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:18.000
They have to, from a PR perspective

02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:20.000
They have to release it

02:41:20.000 --> 02:41:22.000
In a way that it doesn't impact

02:41:22.000 --> 02:41:24.000
Their reputation

02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:26.000
And whatever else they have on the line

02:41:26.000 --> 02:41:28.000
Next week

02:41:28.000 --> 02:41:30.000
I think we can both agree that next week

02:41:30.000 --> 02:41:32.000
Is going to be a very interesting week

02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:34.000
And hopefully we're not sitting here a week from now

02:41:34.000 --> 02:41:36.000
Saying no, we're on day 12 of the PSN outage

02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:38.000
Alright, Zacho, I gotta let you go to get more calls

02:41:38.000 --> 02:41:40.000
I can't wait to see what emails we get in response

02:41:40.000 --> 02:41:42.000
To your call tonight, but have a good one, buddy

02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:44.000
So I have a good one

02:41:44.000 --> 02:41:46.000
Alright, the views and opinions expressed

02:41:46.000 --> 02:41:48.000
By the callers, not necessarily like those

02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:50.000
Alright, 1877 Game OLR

02:41:50.000 --> 02:41:52.000
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio

02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:54.000
SalaciousPop doing his due diligence

02:41:54.000 --> 02:41:56.000
During that call finding some last minute stories

02:41:56.000 --> 02:41:58.000
Gold star for you

02:41:58.000 --> 02:42:02.000
South Korea yesterday voted on a curfew

02:42:02.000 --> 02:42:04.000
That would prevent

02:42:04.000 --> 02:42:06.000
Children under the age of 15

02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:08.000
To play online games

02:42:08.000 --> 02:42:10.000
From midnight until 6 AM

02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:12.000
No more all nighters for the Starcraft 2

02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:14.000
It's all PC gaming it sounds like

02:42:14.000 --> 02:42:16.000
Instead you need to be studying

02:42:16.000 --> 02:42:18.000
And I guess it's being blocked

02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:20.000
On the ISP level

02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:22.000
The DNS to the gaming servers

02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:24.000
If the parents register that they have a kid

02:42:24.000 --> 02:42:26.000
They get cut off

02:42:26.000 --> 02:42:28.000
Kinda scary what the government can do at that level

02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:30.000
It's very interesting

02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:32.000
Alright, we got a phone call, hold on

02:42:32.000 --> 02:42:34.000
We'll revisit this thought in a minute

02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:36.000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

02:42:36.000 --> 02:42:38.000
Hey guys, this is Blue Swim

02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:40.000
I'm doing just fine, how about you guys?

02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:42.000
Good, I wish we had more callers calling

02:42:42.000 --> 02:42:44.000
Hey guys!

02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:46.000
Hey, first time caller as well

02:42:46.000 --> 02:42:48.000
Yes, that's true

02:42:48.000 --> 02:42:50.000
What's on your mind, Blue Swim?

02:42:50.000 --> 02:42:52.000
I was wondering what you guys thought of

02:42:52.000 --> 02:42:54.000
Blaze Blue Continuum Shift 2

02:42:54.000 --> 02:42:56.000
And Dead or Alive Dimensions

02:42:56.000 --> 02:42:58.000
Going practically head to head

02:42:58.000 --> 02:43:00.000
At the end of May

02:43:00.000 --> 02:43:02.000
Well, you know

02:43:02.000 --> 02:43:04.000
It's not the first time that fighters

02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:06.000
Have really gone against each other, I don't think

02:43:06.000 --> 02:43:08.000
Didn't Street Fighter 4 come out

02:43:08.000 --> 02:43:10.000
At the same time as

02:43:10.000 --> 02:43:12.000
Oh god, there was something else

02:43:12.000 --> 02:43:14.000
That came out, I thought right around the same time

02:43:14.000 --> 02:43:16.000
Maybe somebody in chat will get me

02:43:16.000 --> 02:43:18.000
Yeah, but we ignored it because it was Street Fighter 4 coming out

02:43:18.000 --> 02:43:20.000
For real

02:43:20.000 --> 02:43:22.000
I think these two series

02:43:22.000 --> 02:43:24.000
Are kind of separate enough

02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:26.000
Where they can coexist peacefully

02:43:26.000 --> 02:43:28.000
Because let's face it, Blaze Blue, Blazblue

02:43:28.000 --> 02:43:30.000
Whatever you want to call it

02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:32.000
Very heavily Japanese influenced

02:43:32.000 --> 02:43:34.000
Very anime, very, you know

02:43:34.000 --> 02:43:36.000
Dead or Alive

02:43:36.000 --> 02:43:38.000
As much as it's very Japanese

02:43:38.000 --> 02:43:40.000
As well, don't get me wrong

02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:42.000
It's very much more for the T&A audience

02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:44.000
And it kind of

02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:46.000
There you go, it's more of the Texas game

02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:48.000
Because everything's bigger in Texas

02:43:48.000 --> 02:43:50.000
And

02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:52.000
So that's kind of why I'm like

02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:54.000
I think these two games can coexist

02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:56.000
They have very different audiences

02:43:56.000 --> 02:43:58.000
Do you think that

02:43:58.000 --> 02:44:00.000
You know, with the 3DS

02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:02.000
Having three major

02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:04.000
Fighters in the first two months

02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:06.000
Of its life, it's going to turn it into a

02:44:06.000 --> 02:44:08.000
Portable fighting game

02:44:08.000 --> 02:44:10.000
Like the portable gaming

02:44:10.000 --> 02:44:12.000
Fighting game platform

02:44:12.000 --> 02:44:14.000
Yes and no, I mean when those three games

02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:16.000
Are probably the only three games worth owning

02:44:16.000 --> 02:44:18.000
On the 3DS right now

02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:20.000
No, I shouldn't say that

02:44:20.000 --> 02:44:22.000
I also bought Pilotwings, I haven't played it yet

02:44:22.000 --> 02:44:24.000
It's just, it's a little frustrating

02:44:24.000 --> 02:44:26.000
There wasn't a bigger title

02:44:26.000 --> 02:44:28.000
But you know, looking at what Street Fighter 4

02:44:28.000 --> 02:44:30.000
Does, I mean it really brings

02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:32.000
Pretty much the whole experience

02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:34.000
Of the Xbox version

02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:36.000
To the portable console

02:44:36.000 --> 02:44:38.000
And what's interesting about that is that a lot of times

02:44:38.000 --> 02:44:40.000
You used to hear this shit, right

02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:42.000
Like when Mortal Kombat came out on the Game Boy

02:44:42.000 --> 02:44:44.000
It was like

02:44:44.000 --> 02:44:46.000
Experience, the arcade experience

02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:48.000
On the go, and it's like

02:44:48.000 --> 02:44:50.000
Dude, this game fucking blows

02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:52.000
Like I've got two buttons

02:44:52.000 --> 02:44:54.000
And it's all like

02:44:54.000 --> 02:44:56.000
Like you know, it's got like three frames

02:44:56.000 --> 02:44:58.000
A second, this game sucks

02:44:58.000 --> 02:45:00.000
But Street Fighter 4

02:45:00.000 --> 02:45:02.000
It pretty much

02:45:02.000 --> 02:45:04.000
Plays really like the Xbox

02:45:04.000 --> 02:45:06.000
Versions, I'll tell you my biggest bitch

02:45:06.000 --> 02:45:08.000
About the game is the controls

02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:10.000
Like I think it's because I'm not a kid

02:45:10.000 --> 02:45:12.000
And I have fat hands

02:45:12.000 --> 02:45:14.000
But the 3DS thing does not feel

02:45:14.000 --> 02:45:16.000
Very good in my fat hands for trying to play

02:45:16.000 --> 02:45:18.000
A fighter with the L and R buttons and everything

02:45:18.000 --> 02:45:20.000
The analog thumb thing

02:45:20.000 --> 02:45:22.000
In my opinion is too slippery

02:45:22.000 --> 02:45:24.000
And the D-pad is too small

02:45:24.000 --> 02:45:26.000
For my giant spindly man hands

02:45:26.000 --> 02:45:28.000
And I don't like where the D-pad is positioned

02:45:28.000 --> 02:45:30.000
As far as like a fighting game goes

02:45:30.000 --> 02:45:32.000
It's a little weird

02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:34.000
Yeah it cramps the crap out of my hands

02:45:34.000 --> 02:45:36.000
When I'm like playing Bison trying to

02:45:36.000 --> 02:45:38.000
Do like a knee press nightmare or something like that

02:45:38.000 --> 02:45:40.000
It kills my fingers

02:45:40.000 --> 02:45:42.000
Yet I decided to go online and do the whole internet match

02:45:42.000 --> 02:45:44.000
Earlier and I got my ass handed

02:45:44.000 --> 02:45:46.000
To me by some asshole playing as Cody

02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:48.000
Seems like every asshole

02:45:48.000 --> 02:45:50.000
On Street Fighter 4 plays Cody

02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:52.000
And I call them assholes because they're better than me

02:45:52.000 --> 02:45:54.000
What are you

02:45:54.000 --> 02:45:56.000
What fighting game are you looking forward to

02:45:56.000 --> 02:45:58.000
Out of those two?

02:45:58.000 --> 02:46:00.000
I pretty much bought the 3DS at launch

02:46:00.000 --> 02:46:02.000
Expecting the Dead or Alive

02:46:02.000 --> 02:46:04.000
To be there

02:46:04.000 --> 02:46:06.000
I've been a hardcore Dead or Alive fan

02:46:06.000 --> 02:46:08.000
Since 2002

02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:10.000
I want to say

02:46:10.000 --> 02:46:12.000
It prevented me from trading in my original

02:46:12.000 --> 02:46:14.000
Xbox when I discovered

02:46:14.000 --> 02:46:16.000
The Dead or Alive 3 demo

02:46:16.000 --> 02:46:18.000
On demo disc

02:46:18.000 --> 02:46:20.000
And ever since then

02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:22.000
I've been absolutely

02:46:22.000 --> 02:46:24.000
Hooked on the franchise

02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:26.000
I've put maybe 300 hours into

02:46:26.000 --> 02:46:28.000
Dead or Alive Ultimate

02:46:28.000 --> 02:46:30.000
And another 100 and

02:46:30.000 --> 02:46:32.000
100 plus in Dead or Alive 4

02:46:32.000 --> 02:46:34.000
I find it very interesting how they've

02:46:34.000 --> 02:46:36.000
Talked about this whole it's gonna run 30 frames a second

02:46:36.000 --> 02:46:38.000
In 3D but it will run 60 frames

02:46:38.000 --> 02:46:40.000
A second in 2D

02:46:40.000 --> 02:46:42.000
That's a distinction I don't notice as much

02:46:42.000 --> 02:46:44.000
In like Super Street Fighter 4

02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:46.000
It kind of looks the same no matter what mode you're in

02:46:46.000 --> 02:46:48.000
Did you turn the 3D off in the options

02:46:48.000 --> 02:46:50.000
Menu because if you turn the slider

02:46:50.000 --> 02:46:52.000
Off it will still render the game

02:46:52.000 --> 02:46:54.000
In 30 frames per second

02:46:54.000 --> 02:46:56.000
But when you turn the 3D option

02:46:56.000 --> 02:46:58.000
Off in the options menu

02:46:58.000 --> 02:47:00.000
And you're playing like offline

02:47:00.000 --> 02:47:02.000
It is absolutely gorgeous

02:47:02.000 --> 02:47:04.000
I haven't

02:47:04.000 --> 02:47:06.000
I need to try that what a good tip

02:47:06.000 --> 02:47:08.000
I'm glad we do this show see even I learn shit on this show

02:47:08.000 --> 02:47:10.000
No I haven't I'm gonna try that

02:47:10.000 --> 02:47:12.000
Nice maybe that's what I'm missing

02:47:12.000 --> 02:47:14.000
That's gonna run very fluid

02:47:14.000 --> 02:47:16.000
When I try that that's cool

02:47:16.000 --> 02:47:18.000
The 60 frames doesn't carry over to the online

02:47:18.000 --> 02:47:20.000
Portion unfortunately

02:47:20.000 --> 02:47:22.000
But I mean if you're playing you know the arcade

02:47:22.000 --> 02:47:24.000
Mode or versus mode or whatever I mean

02:47:24.000 --> 02:47:26.000
It's just yeah it's gorgeous

02:47:26.000 --> 02:47:28.000
Have you had any real quick before we let you

02:47:28.000 --> 02:47:30.000
Go cause we gotta fit in at least one more call tonight

02:47:30.000 --> 02:47:32.000
Have you had any luck with the street pass in Super Street Fighter 4?

02:47:32.000 --> 02:47:34.000
Not a bit and I've been carrying

02:47:34.000 --> 02:47:36.000
That thing with me almost constantly

02:47:36.000 --> 02:47:38.000
You know I live near Nashville

02:47:38.000 --> 02:47:40.000
And there's a ton of

02:47:40.000 --> 02:47:42.000
You know ton of stores around here you know

02:47:42.000 --> 02:47:44.000
Best Buy and GameStop and stuff like that

02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:46.000
I have not had one street pass fight with them

02:47:46.000 --> 02:47:48.000
Interesting I mean I'm hearing

02:47:48.000 --> 02:47:50.000
Those things aren't activating very much and it could be a variety

02:47:50.000 --> 02:47:52.000
Of things it could be that the battery life is so

02:47:52.000 --> 02:47:54.000
Eh on those things that it's not pulsing

02:47:54.000 --> 02:47:56.000
The street pass very often

02:47:56.000 --> 02:47:58.000
That's kinda one thing I'm hearing and then the other is just

02:47:58.000 --> 02:48:00.000
You know how many people carry their DS in sleep mode

02:48:00.000 --> 02:48:02.000
With them everywhere they go very few

02:48:02.000 --> 02:48:04.000
So I don't know I'm gonna try

02:48:04.000 --> 02:48:06.000
This week I'm gonna try going to the mall this week

02:48:06.000 --> 02:48:08.000
And see if I get anybody on street pass

02:48:08.000 --> 02:48:10.000
At least walk into GameStop you know some of those employees

02:48:10.000 --> 02:48:12.000
Have gotta have it going we'll see

02:48:12.000 --> 02:48:14.000
I think that's where I got

02:48:14.000 --> 02:48:16.000
Where I got one of my

02:48:16.000 --> 02:48:18.000
Street pass me's was

02:48:18.000 --> 02:48:20.000
GameStop and the other was like a demo unit at Best Buy

02:48:20.000 --> 02:48:22.000
Other than that I haven't had any action

02:48:22.000 --> 02:48:24.000
On it I never thought of trying a demo unit

02:48:24.000 --> 02:48:26.000
At Best Buy that's a great idea

02:48:26.000 --> 02:48:28.000
We'll see alright BlueSwip I've gotta let you

02:48:28.000 --> 02:48:30.000
Go so we can get more calls but thanks for the call

02:48:30.000 --> 02:48:32.000
Thank you very much have a good night

02:48:32.000 --> 02:48:34.000
You too happy birthday Jamie

02:48:34.000 --> 02:48:36.000
Thank you

02:48:36.000 --> 02:48:38.000
See I like enthusiastic

02:48:38.000 --> 02:48:40.000
Callers people that just I'm just really happy to be

02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:42.000
Here

02:48:42.000 --> 02:48:44.000
Exciting alright sorry

02:48:44.000 --> 02:48:46.000
I want more happy people

02:48:46.000 --> 02:48:48.000
Everyone

02:48:48.000 --> 02:48:50.000
BlueSwip should be your role model

02:48:50.000 --> 02:48:52.000
Alright other

02:48:52.000 --> 02:48:54.000
Stories that you've got Salacious Popper I don't know

02:48:54.000 --> 02:48:56.000
If you want to finish your thoughts on that last one

02:48:56.000 --> 02:48:58.000
Well I was just saying that for the

02:48:58.000 --> 02:49:00.000
South Korea gaming curfew that's a

02:49:00.000 --> 02:49:02.000
Part of the world not necessarily

02:49:02.000 --> 02:49:04.000
Just South Korea where people will just

02:49:04.000 --> 02:49:06.000
Stop peeing when they play

02:49:06.000 --> 02:49:08.000
Starcraft 2 and then they die

02:49:08.000 --> 02:49:10.000
Bladder explodes and they die so obviously

02:49:10.000 --> 02:49:12.000
I think there's a demand for that kind of regulation

02:49:12.000 --> 02:49:14.000
I forgot to mention I played some more Starcraft 2

02:49:14.000 --> 02:49:16.000
This week Starjeweled is my new

02:49:16.000 --> 02:49:18.000
Favorite add-on ever for Starcraft

02:49:18.000 --> 02:49:20.000
It's great you play Bejeweled

02:49:20.000 --> 02:49:22.000
And then you use the points you get in Bejeweled

02:49:22.000 --> 02:49:24.000
To like buy units and it's like a tug

02:49:24.000 --> 02:49:26.000
Of war match it's awesome

02:49:26.000 --> 02:49:28.000
Like Jamie you might

02:49:28.000 --> 02:49:30.000
Actually like Starcraft 2 if I were to buy

02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:32.000
That I don't know we'll see

02:49:32.000 --> 02:49:34.000
Hi I'm here

02:49:34.000 --> 02:49:36.000
I'm here

02:49:36.000 --> 02:49:38.000
Echoing you got to fix that

02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:40.000
I don't know why but I'm hearing myself come through

02:49:40.000 --> 02:49:42.000
You got to fix your settings

02:49:42.000 --> 02:49:44.000
But thank you for the bags

02:49:46.000 --> 02:49:48.000
Alright we'll see maybe he'll fix that

02:49:48.000 --> 02:49:50.000
And try calling back

02:49:50.000 --> 02:49:52.000
Which nobody else but the people in this room and he will get

02:49:52.000 --> 02:49:54.000
1877 game

02:49:54.000 --> 02:49:56.000
OLR username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio

02:49:56.000 --> 02:49:58.000
Echo123 is always a good way

02:49:58.000 --> 02:50:00.000
To test this that's somebody who calls us pretty regularly

02:50:00.000 --> 02:50:02.000
Though so I don't know what's going on

02:50:02.000 --> 02:50:04.000
Quick last minute story Minecraft

02:50:04.000 --> 02:50:06.000
2 million paid

02:50:06.000 --> 02:50:08.000
Fuck that's a game I still haven't played

02:50:08.000 --> 02:50:10.000
2 million people have paid for the

02:50:10.000 --> 02:50:12.000
Beta access which is roughly

02:50:12.000 --> 02:50:14.000
28-29% of its

02:50:14.000 --> 02:50:16.000
Entire user base

02:50:16.000 --> 02:50:18.000
So a third so a little under

02:50:18.000 --> 02:50:20.000
A third of their player base is paid for the game

02:50:20.000 --> 02:50:22.000
For a little indie sandbox kind of

02:50:22.000 --> 02:50:24.000
Aspie

02:50:24.000 --> 02:50:26.000
Thing that's pretty impressive

02:50:26.000 --> 02:50:28.000
You know some are saying it's too early to call Portal 2

02:50:28.000 --> 02:50:30.000
The game of the year when you have something like Minecraft

02:50:30.000 --> 02:50:32.000
Out there

02:50:32.000 --> 02:50:34.000
It has that same 3D

02:50:34.000 --> 02:50:36.000
With the weird spritey problem

02:50:36.000 --> 02:50:38.000
I can't play it for very long

02:50:38.000 --> 02:50:40.000
I need to check it out

02:50:40.000 --> 02:50:42.000
We need to play Minecraft

02:50:42.000 --> 02:50:44.000
We need to have Minecraft night

02:50:44.000 --> 02:50:46.000
Try to figure out why people lose their shit over this game

02:50:46.000 --> 02:50:48.000
I think it's 15 euros

02:50:48.000 --> 02:50:50.000
Which translates to like 20 bucks

02:50:50.000 --> 02:50:52.000
Or 22 bucks US because the euros are worth more than the dollar

02:50:52.000 --> 02:50:54.000
Yeah

02:50:54.000 --> 02:50:56.000
I remember it being like $19.99

02:50:56.000 --> 02:50:58.000
They have a demo though right?

02:50:58.000 --> 02:51:00.000
Isn't there like demo levels?

02:51:00.000 --> 02:51:02.000
Do you?

02:51:02.000 --> 02:51:04.000
Yeah hold on I want it

02:51:04.000 --> 02:51:06.000
1877 game OLR username on skype is orange

02:51:06.000 --> 02:51:08.000
I'm going to try keeping it open one more second

02:51:08.000 --> 02:51:10.000
Especially if that last guy can get there

02:51:10.000 --> 02:51:12.000
Oh maybe I deleted it

02:51:12.000 --> 02:51:14.000
I'm so bad I always forget

02:51:14.000 --> 02:51:16.000
I still have Ragnarok online

02:51:16.000 --> 02:51:18.000
Let's see

02:51:18.000 --> 02:51:20.000
An obvious spam person out of Bulgaria wants to be our friend

02:51:20.000 --> 02:51:22.000
Block

02:51:22.000 --> 02:51:24.000
That's no fun

02:51:24.000 --> 02:51:26.000
Alright we're going to try this one more time

02:51:26.000 --> 02:51:28.000
Give this guy one more chance here

02:51:28.000 --> 02:51:30.000
Let's go back to the phones

02:51:30.000 --> 02:51:32.000
No it's still echoing

02:51:32.000 --> 02:51:34.000
Hello?

02:51:34.000 --> 02:51:36.000
Now I'm not hearing it

02:51:36.000 --> 02:51:38.000
Yeah I wasn't doing it before

02:51:38.000 --> 02:51:40.000
You hung up and I was like okay that's kind of weird

02:51:40.000 --> 02:51:42.000
And I tried to echo and the echo came out fine

02:51:42.000 --> 02:51:44.000
That's weird alright well it works now what's on your mind buddy?

02:51:44.000 --> 02:51:46.000
By the way this is xlink

02:51:46.000 --> 02:51:48.000
Hi xlink sorry

02:51:48.000 --> 02:51:50.000
I recognize your voice at this point

02:51:50.000 --> 02:51:52.000
What's on your mind buddy?

02:51:52.000 --> 02:51:54.000
You know actually it was kind of funny

02:51:54.000 --> 02:51:56.000
Another caller kind of talked about this earlier

02:51:56.000 --> 02:51:58.000
The whole Valve thing in Portal 2

02:51:58.000 --> 02:52:04.000
I was watching the whole thing as it unfolded right before Portal 2 came out

02:52:04.000 --> 02:52:06.000
The ARG

02:52:06.000 --> 02:52:14.000
And it's kind of cool reading the stories of how Valve gave pretty much open access to these indie companies

02:52:14.000 --> 02:52:18.000
You know basically telling hey you want to be part of this come on in we'll give you full access

02:52:18.000 --> 02:52:20.000
We'll help you any way possible

02:52:20.000 --> 02:52:22.000
We'll give you all these materials

02:52:22.000 --> 02:52:25.000
We'll do anything we can to make this work

02:52:25.000 --> 02:52:36.000
And it was really cool reading some of the company stories of like how everything progressed from day one to the night of the release

02:52:36.000 --> 02:52:38.000
When everything got completed

02:52:38.000 --> 02:52:45.000
Is that the whole thing I heard at the tail end of Bobby's show where there's like an iPad app that Jeff Keighley was involved with

02:52:45.000 --> 02:52:51.000
Where they've like chronicled the entire last development cycle of Portal is that what you're talking about?

02:52:51.000 --> 02:52:57.000
Likely yes and I don't know exactly what the app has in it because I don't have it right now

02:52:57.000 --> 02:53:01.000
And I don't have the money for it so I can't really tell

02:53:01.000 --> 02:53:06.000
But the impression that I'm getting from our pal Bobby who talked about it a little bit more on his show tonight

02:53:06.000 --> 02:53:10.000
Is that it's basically like imagine like an interactive news article

02:53:10.000 --> 02:53:13.000
And when I say or I should say magazine feature

02:53:13.000 --> 02:53:21.000
Because it's more like what 10,000 word article or something like that that has videos, pictures, behind the scenes stuff

02:53:21.000 --> 02:53:22.000
Probably

02:53:22.000 --> 02:53:27.000
Yeah it kind of sounds like honestly what more magazines ought to be doing on the iPad

02:53:27.000 --> 02:53:28.000
Yeah

02:53:28.000 --> 02:53:32.000
The people and how all these people, these groups of people don't know each other

02:53:32.000 --> 02:53:37.000
And they're willing going hey I have a free copy of like audio surf I'm willing to give to you

02:53:37.000 --> 02:53:41.000
So that way you get your potatoes so that way we can make the multiplier faster

02:53:41.000 --> 02:53:46.000
So we can get you know it was very cool seeing everybody come together the squad going

02:53:46.000 --> 02:53:51.000
Okay which game should we play we should play this one so this way the timer can go down more and more and more

02:53:51.000 --> 02:53:57.000
And it was just very neat watching the whole thing as it unfolded it was very cool

02:53:57.000 --> 02:54:05.000
That is yeah I did play I did my part I played audio surf it was fun even though I had no intention of buying it on PC

02:54:05.000 --> 02:54:09.000
Because I knew I'd already had the PS3 one ordered but it was still it was you know it was fun

02:54:09.000 --> 02:54:14.000
I like those things kind of get the community riled up like that and Valve is a heck of a company

02:54:14.000 --> 02:54:19.000
That's really what it boils down to I mean they just has Valve ever put out a bad game

02:54:19.000 --> 02:54:21.000
No not that I know

02:54:21.000 --> 02:54:26.000
Yeah Valve is in a very elite group of developers that just does not put out bad games

02:54:26.000 --> 02:54:29.000
And I would say Blizzard's probably in there too

02:54:29.000 --> 02:54:33.000
Blizzard I don't think has ever put out a bad game until Cataclysm no I'm kidding I'm kidding

02:54:33.000 --> 02:54:40.000
And then let's see what else there's got to be at least one other I'm sure there's many folks

02:54:40.000 --> 02:54:46.000
Bioware has a pedigree but that's then you're getting to the more you know

02:54:46.000 --> 02:54:50.000
See part of me would say well Bethesda because they put out such awesome stuff

02:54:50.000 --> 02:54:53.000
And then I'm like oh but they did that Star Trek game that was really not good

02:54:53.000 --> 02:54:57.000
So you know a lot of developers do have a little blemishes on their record

02:54:57.000 --> 02:55:04.000
Or bizarre creations before they close but they made that Bond game that wasn't so hot so unfortunately they had a blemish too

02:55:04.000 --> 02:55:06.000
You know so but there's very rare companies

02:55:06.000 --> 02:55:10.000
It's in a myth market depending on what the people want at the time so I mean you know

02:55:10.000 --> 02:55:15.000
And it depends on who does it to a lot of it depends on how much work they put into it you know

02:55:15.000 --> 02:55:18.000
If they're gonna put it in work for six months they throw it out there in the market inspect it to sell

02:55:18.000 --> 02:55:23.000
And it turns out to be a complete piece of shit I mean you know you can't really get too much from it

02:55:23.000 --> 02:55:30.000
But it's obvious they took a lot of time and effort behind what they want and it really paid off

02:55:30.000 --> 02:55:35.000
It paid off in big time so like I said before people were very happy with this whole thing

02:55:35.000 --> 02:55:40.000
And the way it unfolded at the end so and then of course with Portal 2 being the way it is so

02:55:40.000 --> 02:55:46.000
Kaiju in our chat room says Valve put out that shitty poker game I believe that was Telltale wasn't it

02:55:46.000 --> 02:55:49.000
That was Telltale and it's not really that bad unless you really find it

02:55:49.000 --> 02:55:51.000
It's a budget title

02:55:51.000 --> 02:55:57.000
It's a budget title and it's really short and I wish they would I kind of wish they would add

02:55:57.000 --> 02:56:03.000
Maybe a few extra people or extra things to it but for a budget title being ten bucks for poker

02:56:03.000 --> 02:56:05.000
It's not really all that bad

02:56:05.000 --> 02:56:13.000
And Telltale's about in that pedigree too I mean it kind of depends how into the games they're putting out you are

02:56:13.000 --> 02:56:16.000
But they put out a lot of quality stuff too

02:56:16.000 --> 02:56:17.000
Yeah

02:56:17.000 --> 02:56:22.000
So anyway sorry I don't want to turn this into a developer penis size contest but you know I thought it would be fun

02:56:22.000 --> 02:56:27.000
And the gearbox was very interesting too that whole story about the proposal too

02:56:27.000 --> 02:56:32.000
You should watch both the videos first the video of the proposal and then how it all came about

02:56:32.000 --> 02:56:37.000
Because he checked a bunch of his friends saying that he got the exclusive for the

02:56:37.000 --> 02:56:41.000
Because being a big fan they gave him an exclusive for Borderlands 2

02:56:41.000 --> 02:56:46.000
And it turned out to be the proposal video so it's very cute how the whole thing came around

02:56:46.000 --> 02:56:47.000
Wow

02:56:47.000 --> 02:56:54.000
Gearbox got off the ground thanks to Valve because Gearbox got the Half-Life 1 expansion license

02:56:54.000 --> 02:56:56.000
They did Blue Shift and

02:56:56.000 --> 02:56:58.000
Oh wow I didn't even know that

02:56:58.000 --> 02:57:05.000
Something Force with the Marine Adrian Shepard but the Half-Life expansions that came out in 98-99 that was Gearbox

02:57:05.000 --> 02:57:06.000
Well there you go

02:57:06.000 --> 02:57:10.000
Alright well X-Link I got to let you go so we can wrap up the show but any other quick final thoughts

02:57:10.000 --> 02:57:17.000
Nope that's about it sorry about the call earlier sorry about all that usually I don't have any of those problems I usually call Echo 1, 2, 3 beforehand so

02:57:17.000 --> 02:57:19.000
Minus 50 DKP

02:57:19.000 --> 02:57:20.000
Yeah no joke

02:57:20.000 --> 02:57:21.000
Later

02:57:21.000 --> 02:57:22.000
Later

02:57:22.000 --> 02:57:29.000
Alright that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight if you didn't get through help Jamie get tacos by sending an email instead mailbag at orangelawnsradio.com

02:57:29.000 --> 02:57:32.000
Well how did I fucking agree to buy her fucking tacos

02:57:32.000 --> 02:57:34.000
I am awesome

02:57:34.000 --> 02:57:37.000
Alright and Skype crashed right as I closed

02:57:37.000 --> 02:57:39.000
Rob's great heart

02:57:39.000 --> 02:57:46.000
I know alright well that's a sign that we need to wrap up the show and get on out of here so we can't wrap up the show though until we go around and get some final thoughts

02:57:46.000 --> 02:57:50.000
Oh actually I should ask if you have any other quick last minute stories you want to get out

02:57:50.000 --> 02:57:51.000
No

02:57:51.000 --> 02:58:00.000
No you're good alright well then I will say thank you very much for being here Salacious Pop tonight really appreciate it especially on short notice and filling in for Loki you did a great job with the stories and everything

02:58:00.000 --> 02:58:01.000
It's been a very fun show

02:58:01.000 --> 02:58:06.000
Not everybody can just waltz right in here and read the stories so really appreciate it hope you had fun

02:58:06.000 --> 02:58:07.000
Thank you as always

02:58:07.000 --> 02:58:08.000
Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners

02:58:08.000 --> 02:58:15.000
Remember to go outside and don't play too much portal 2 in Mortal Kombat back to back

02:58:15.000 --> 02:58:16.000
That's right

02:58:16.000 --> 02:58:21.000
Alright my final thought is now I want tacos I hate you

02:58:21.000 --> 02:58:22.000
You don't

02:58:22.000 --> 02:58:23.000
You're right I don't

02:58:23.000 --> 02:58:25.000
But right now I do

02:58:25.000 --> 02:58:27.000
Dark soccer your final thought tonight

02:58:27.000 --> 02:58:30.000
I'm hungry I want a taco

02:58:30.000 --> 02:58:42.000
I guess that seems to be the theme tonight so tune in next week when you'll find out where did we get tacos on the very informative episode 411 of Orange Laundry next week see what I did there see what I did there

02:58:42.000 --> 02:58:44.000
Alright by the way if you like the show

02:58:44.000 --> 02:58:47.000
If that's gonna go then I hate to see episode 420

02:58:47.000 --> 02:58:52.000
Which was supposed to land on our 9 year anniversary but apparently they're off by like a week so we'll see

Alright anyhow thank you guys so much for downloading our show by the way really appreciate it thanks for checking it out thanks for listening to the whole thing

02:59:00.000 --> 02:59:09.000
Thank you guys for participating thank you for showing up every week as you do you know we don't put commercials in the show sure I say nice things about Amazon once in a while or whatever company is on my good side this week

02:59:09.000 --> 02:59:19.000
But all we ask you guys if you like what you hear on the show leave us a nice review on iTunes tell a friend about the show help us spread the word because we don't have a giant magazine company behind us

02:59:19.000 --> 02:59:31.000
We're not you know getting paid $70,000 a year to do journalism or whatever just spread the word that's all we ask tell a friend about what we're doing here and that's the juice that keeps our show powered

02:59:31.000 --> 02:59:33.000
That and peeps

02:59:33.000 --> 02:59:35.000
