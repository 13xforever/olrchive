00:01:31,131 --> 00:01:32,051
[SPEAKER_04]: And it tasted delicious.

19
00:01:32,071 --> 00:01:35,032
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know about you guys, I'd still eat that, even though it's a cake of failure.

00:01:35,132 --> 00:01:36,633

00:02:38,514 --> 00:02:38,854

[SPEAKER_09]: Now, we missed April Fool's this year because the show's tonight's on the 3rd, but you were mentioning a really good April Fool's joke you thought we should have done.

57
00:02:48,939 --> 00:02:51,080
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I can't talk about it or else I can't do it next year.

[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah, we gotta do it next year, I guess.

59
00:02:52,981 --> 00:02:54,062
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, it's really good, y'all.

60
00:02:54,282 --> 00:03:03,727
[SPEAKER_06]: It was basically like OLR episode three coming, like from the vault of 1982 where the news stories are like, yeah, I'm really looking forward to that E.T.

00:03:03,747 --> 00:03:04,388

62
00:03:04,648 --> 00:03:05,888
[SPEAKER_06]: It's gonna be great.

63
00:03:06,609 --> 00:03:09,570
[SPEAKER_09]: The only thing about that is it's kind of close to what YouTube did.

64
00:03:10,171 --> 00:03:11,211
[SPEAKER_09]: So it'll be better next year.

65
00:03:11,331 --> 00:03:11,551
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

66
00:03:11,732 --> 00:03:12,552
[SPEAKER_09]: Next year, y'all forget.

67
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:17,755
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a little too close to Flugelhorn Feline, which, by the way, was the best April Fool's joke on the web, just so you know.

68
00:03:18,415 --> 00:03:45,358
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, anyhow Well, by the way, Rob, it's not a rumor Now, see, oh Okay, before we went live tonight See, now I have to talk about all this Because you brought it up Okay, before we went live tonight Bobby was abbreviated tonight So we went live a little bit early Just kind of BSing with the live listeners And doing some music And one of the topics that came up before the show Was the Wachowski brothers And they did The Matrix And there's these rumors or something going around That one of them had a sex change

[SPEAKER_04]: Credited in IMDB.

76
00:03:56,706 --> 00:03:58,748
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought some producer said it wasn't true, IDK.

[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I mean, you know.

78

[SPEAKER_04]: All right, there you go.

79
00:04:02,352 --> 00:04:03,974
[SPEAKER_09]: If it's on IMDB, I guess it's true.

80
00:04:05,115 --> 00:04:05,616
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

81
00:04:07,321 --> 00:04:09,363

00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,040
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe so.

93
00:04:32,941 --> 00:04:38,584
[SPEAKER_09]: Twitter, OLR, Facebook, Orange Lines Radio, etc, etc Now we can talk about games Hi DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

94
00:04:39,104 --> 00:04:59,155
[SPEAKER_04]: I played a lot of Dragon Age 2 I borrowed it from my friend's husband Well, he's my friend too, but I borrowed his game And it's really fun And I'm kind of hooked And I played some WoW And some Final Fantasy 3 And then I looked at games at Fries with you two

95
00:05:00,976 --> 00:05:01,956
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, that was it.

96
00:05:01,996 --> 00:05:03,777
[SPEAKER_09]: We went shopping last night and not for shoes.

97
00:05:04,317 --> 00:05:05,237
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't buy anything.

98
00:05:05,657 --> 00:05:05,917
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

99
00:05:05,977 --> 00:05:10,919
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of sad to go to a huge electronic stores like Fry's, which I don't think they have those everywhere.

100
00:05:10,939 --> 00:05:11,899
[SPEAKER_09]: I think just on the West Coast.

101
00:05:11,939 --> 00:05:14,660
[SPEAKER_09]: So Fry's is just like it's an Uber electronic store.

102
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,940
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they're spread around.

103
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,700
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, there might be a few in other places.

104
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,821
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, it's an Uber electronic store.

105
00:05:19,881 --> 00:05:21,561
[SPEAKER_09]: Huge games section, huge computer section.

106
00:05:21,581 --> 00:05:23,802
[SPEAKER_09]: We went in there, looked around, didn't buy anything.

107
00:05:23,922 --> 00:05:24,462
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of sad.

108
00:05:24,602 --> 00:05:26,483
[SPEAKER_04]: Their PSP section amazed me.

109
00:05:27,543 --> 00:05:28,944
[SPEAKER_04]: That still exists.

110
00:05:29,005 --> 00:05:31,847
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, there's still a lot of good stuff coming on the PSP.

111
00:05:31,867 --> 00:05:32,808
[SPEAKER_09]: The UMDs.

112
00:05:33,689 --> 00:05:37,572
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, the UMDs were what impressed me, too, that they're still really supporting them.

113
00:05:38,313 --> 00:05:39,995
[SPEAKER_09]: $10 for most of them.

114
00:05:40,015 --> 00:05:41,916
[SPEAKER_10]: Because they got them really cheap, I'm sure.

115
00:05:41,957 --> 00:05:42,717
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess so.

116
00:05:42,837 --> 00:05:43,218
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

117
00:05:43,618 --> 00:05:47,561
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, there's only one company still supporting UMD, and that's Sony.

118
00:05:48,202 --> 00:05:48,542
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course.

119
00:05:49,483 --> 00:05:51,824
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't remember the last movie.

120
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:54,907
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to say 2012 was one of the last movies to come out for it.

121
00:05:55,087 --> 00:05:57,989
[SPEAKER_10]: Because they are kick-ass, whatever came out last year.

122
00:05:58,561 --> 00:05:59,061
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

123
00:06:16,997 --> 00:06:21,440
[SPEAKER_09]: Castlevania Lords of Shadow Castlevania Lords of Shadow Castlevania Lords of Shadow

124
00:06:38,409 --> 00:06:40,130
[SPEAKER_10]: I hate fucking going to visit you in Fries

125
00:07:02,424 --> 00:07:08,466
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, anyhow, Loki, wait, wait, I want to go back to DarkSakura and talk more about Dragon Age 2 because I haven't played the game.

126
00:07:08,626 --> 00:07:10,526
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you're enjoying Dragon Age 2?

127
00:07:11,066 --> 00:07:12,667
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it has Eve Miles doing a voice.

128
00:07:13,327 --> 00:07:15,828
[SPEAKER_04]: For anyone who does not know, she was Gwen on Torchwood.

129
00:07:16,428 --> 00:07:17,908
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, you didn't really play the first game, right?

130
00:07:18,008 --> 00:07:18,188
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

131
00:07:18,408 --> 00:07:19,909
[SPEAKER_09]: And you're doing okay with the second game?

132
00:07:20,029 --> 00:07:20,549
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, just fine.

133
00:07:20,669 --> 00:07:21,829
[SPEAKER_09]: What is it that you like so much about it?

134
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:23,470
[SPEAKER_04]: Lesbians.

135
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:24,410
What?

136
00:07:26,294 --> 00:07:26,634
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.com

137
00:07:44,764 --> 00:08:07,255
[SPEAKER_04]: and uh but they they've already had like love chat and then there's this one guy who is hitting on my character I was like no you're gross but he was apparently from an earlier game he's the one that you give him a cat called Sir Pounce a lot I guess he was talking about his cat and then there's Isabella who's according to Tiara she's a slut she can sleep with her a bunch uh-huh

138
00:08:07,475 --> 00:08:08,596
[SPEAKER_04]: And then she's like, oh, it's just sex.

139
00:08:09,877 --> 00:08:12,139
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm like, I haven't gotten to any fun part, though.

140
00:08:12,179 --> 00:08:15,762
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I've done a lot of... I really like this game, but it's not fun.

141
00:08:16,202 --> 00:08:16,542
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

142
00:08:16,842 --> 00:08:18,043
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of what I just heard.

143
00:08:18,103 --> 00:08:18,824
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just me.

144
00:08:19,344 --> 00:08:21,606
[SPEAKER_04]: I've done a lot of killing, which is great.

145
00:08:21,886 --> 00:08:23,428
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've got it in extra gore mode.

146
00:08:24,468 --> 00:08:26,810
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're covered in blood when you're done with a fight.

147
00:08:27,471 --> 00:08:28,832
[SPEAKER_04]: Like splattered on their face.

148
00:08:29,953 --> 00:08:31,254
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I was like, that's awesome.

149
00:08:31,274 --> 00:08:32,555
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, gore and lesbians, got it.

150
00:08:33,636 --> 00:08:34,817
[SPEAKER_09]: This game really isn't fun.

151
00:08:34,917 --> 00:08:35,978
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just here for the pussy.

152
00:08:37,196 --> 00:08:37,636
[SPEAKER_09]: and Gore.

153
00:08:38,937 --> 00:08:39,998
[SPEAKER_04]: It actually is really fun.

154
00:08:40,118 --> 00:08:43,079
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just I'm still in the first act.

155
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:44,980
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, you're like in the grind or something, right?

156
00:08:45,821 --> 00:08:45,961
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

157
00:08:45,981 --> 00:08:47,042
[SPEAKER_09]: Trying to grind out that pussy.

158
00:08:48,162 --> 00:08:51,544
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, some elven cooch.

159
00:08:51,684 --> 00:08:52,865
[SPEAKER_09]: Say no more.

160
00:08:52,945 --> 00:08:53,885
[SPEAKER_09]: What's the battle system like?

161
00:08:53,925 --> 00:08:55,787
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not like a Final Fantasy RPG, right?

162
00:08:55,867 --> 00:08:59,288
[SPEAKER_04]: It's more like a... No, it's like you run down the stairs.

163
00:08:59,389 --> 00:09:00,509
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh no, there's people there.

164
00:09:00,989 --> 00:09:04,171
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of your party comments about how there shouldn't be people on the street after dark.

165
00:09:04,531 --> 00:09:05,212
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you have to kill them.

166
00:09:06,273 --> 00:09:30,951
[SPEAKER_04]: and there's blood everywhere and you occasionally they're like highwaymen and things and you can go outside of the town to certain areas and you'll find like piles of bones and you can dig through them for loot it's really great though I mean it's just and okay I guess this so now you're talking about touching bones in your quest for pussy my quest for pussy

167
00:09:32,225 --> 00:09:39,450
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's... There's also... You know, you can go through people's stuff, and right now I'm actually trying to build up my character so I can get the lockpicking.

168
00:09:40,211 --> 00:09:43,714
[SPEAKER_04]: So I can open locked trunks and stuff and steal people's stuff.

169
00:09:44,774 --> 00:09:47,857
[SPEAKER_04]: And... What else was I doing?

170
00:09:49,978 --> 00:09:54,560
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm doing a lot of the side quests too so I can level up before I get to the big thing.

171
00:09:55,080 --> 00:10:02,744
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's somewhere else that I need to go to get some dude named Fenris who was, I think, in one of the last games.

172
00:10:02,764 --> 00:10:03,685
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's going to be a three-way.

173
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:05,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, no, I don't know.

174
00:10:07,186 --> 00:10:11,068
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, Meryl is my fangirlism because I adore Eve Miles.

175
00:10:12,109 --> 00:10:13,049
[SPEAKER_04]: She's very cool.

176
00:10:13,089 --> 00:10:14,470
[SPEAKER_04]: And Welsh accents to me are hot.

177
00:10:15,751 --> 00:10:16,191
[SPEAKER_04]: Really hot.

178
00:10:18,747 --> 00:10:35,349
[SPEAKER_04]: so apparently though and I don't the elves that live outside are all Welsh the elves and humans that live in the town are all British and dwarves are American is what I'm getting so far

179
00:10:37,017 --> 00:10:39,541
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas, you know, don't we usually have dwarves being Scottish?

180
00:10:39,561 --> 00:10:41,563
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, if you play WoW a lot, yeah, dwarves are Scottish.

181
00:10:41,984 --> 00:10:43,306
[SPEAKER_04]: Or, you know, Lord of the Rings.

182
00:10:44,207 --> 00:10:47,632
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, no, he sounded vaguely... He sounded Welsh.

183
00:10:48,433 --> 00:10:50,816
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well, you think you'll play Dragon Age 2 through to completion?

184
00:10:51,857 --> 00:10:52,138
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

185
00:10:52,768 --> 00:10:53,749
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, that's good.

186
00:10:53,769 --> 00:10:54,590
[SPEAKER_09]: It's always good to finish.

187
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,733
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll take pictures of the lesbian scene.

188
00:10:56,913 --> 00:10:57,554
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, please do.

189
00:10:57,574 --> 00:10:59,436
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, let's move on over to Loki.

190
00:10:59,716 --> 00:11:00,677
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

191
00:11:00,998 --> 00:11:01,678
[SPEAKER_10]: It was okay.

192
00:11:01,778 --> 00:11:09,848
[SPEAKER_10]: I played Motorstorm Apocalypse through rookie mode now, and I think most of the way through pro mode, although...

193
00:11:11,189 --> 00:11:17,215
[SPEAKER_10]: All the races have been somewhat difficult up until now, and it's just like, oh, and now it's really, really hard.

194
00:11:17,896 --> 00:11:20,699
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm actually stuck on one race right now.

195
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,662
[SPEAKER_10]: But really enjoying it still.

196
00:11:24,703 --> 00:11:28,487
[SPEAKER_10]: Storyline's still really cheesy, but still pretty fun game.

197
00:11:29,107 --> 00:11:31,310
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I've been playing...

198
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:35,141
[SPEAKER_10]: On my 3DS, really only Pilotwings right now.

199
00:11:35,881 --> 00:11:43,366
[SPEAKER_10]: And I haven't really played any of the, like, I don't know, the missions or whatever you have to do, the different challenges.

200
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:51,531
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been mainly the free flying, which is kind of annoying a little bit because you can only fly around for like a few minutes at a time.

201
00:11:52,792 --> 00:11:54,914
[SPEAKER_10]: Which is so stupid.

202
00:11:55,334 --> 00:11:56,695
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like three minutes at a time.

203
00:11:56,835 --> 00:11:57,575
[SPEAKER_10]: Woo!

204
00:11:58,216 --> 00:11:58,956
[SPEAKER_10]: Fun!

205
00:11:59,116 --> 00:12:01,598
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I mean, you do only have a limited amount of fuel, right?

206
00:12:03,129 --> 00:12:09,073
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, okay, if you want to go by that route, then why can't I have it where I refuel?

207
00:12:09,593 --> 00:12:10,974
[SPEAKER_09]: Gas is expensive, you know.

208
00:12:11,995 --> 00:12:15,297
[SPEAKER_10]: Or like when I'm using the rocket belt, I never get low on fuel.

209
00:12:15,377 --> 00:12:21,581
[SPEAKER_10]: I could hold that throttle down the whole way, and it just never would run out of fuel.

210
00:12:22,162 --> 00:12:31,728
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'm basically collecting these markers or whatever they're in the game, and I have 74 of 75 of them, so I'm still trying to find the last one.

211
00:12:33,489 --> 00:12:36,791
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just like the Woohoo Island thing.

212
00:12:37,911 --> 00:12:39,052
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like, oh, hey, look at this.

213
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:39,912
[SPEAKER_10]: This is kind of cool.

214
00:12:39,932 --> 00:12:41,673
[SPEAKER_10]: This is from Wii Sports Resort.

215
00:12:41,853 --> 00:12:44,794
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, this is the part where you can... Here's the bowling alley.

216
00:12:44,894 --> 00:12:45,974
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's all this stuff from the game.

217
00:12:45,994 --> 00:12:49,716
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, okay, well, none of this has to do with flying.

218
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:52,437
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you crash through the roof of the bowling alley?

219
00:12:52,757 --> 00:12:53,658
[SPEAKER_10]: No, you can't.

220
00:12:54,478 --> 00:12:55,239
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for watching!

221
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,562
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time.

222
00:13:35,334 --> 00:13:44,759
[SPEAKER_09]: There needs to be a dark Pilotwings where you can rocket belt into the bowling alley and steal a baby and run away with it.

223
00:13:45,179 --> 00:13:49,261
[SPEAKER_10]: Once again, and this is unfortunate, this goes back to Nintendo.

224
00:13:49,761 --> 00:13:53,903
[SPEAKER_10]: What they do with new games, or I should say games that they put out again.

225
00:13:54,844 --> 00:14:02,027
[SPEAKER_10]: They basically take them, they don't add any features to it, and they strip it down to what the bare essentials that they need to do another release for are.

226
00:14:02,607 --> 00:14:04,328
[SPEAKER_10]: Just like all the Animal Crossing games.

227
00:14:04,829 --> 00:14:05,749
[SPEAKER_10]: And here's the problem.

228
00:14:05,809 --> 00:14:07,510
[SPEAKER_10]: People like us keep buying them.

229
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:11,413
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, you're the only one that's bought a 3DS in this room.

230
00:14:12,113 --> 00:14:13,494
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'm talking about Animal Crossing.

231
00:14:13,514 --> 00:14:13,914
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, okay.

232
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:19,318
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'm just saying it's people like us that keep buying those crappy games.

233
00:14:19,638 --> 00:14:23,000
[SPEAKER_10]: And it just gives them the impression, okay, so we don't really have to do anything.

234
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,041
[SPEAKER_10]: People just still buy our games.

235
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:25,822
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just like the whole Tron thing.

236
00:14:26,102 --> 00:14:26,943
[SPEAKER_10]: What's different this year?

237
00:14:27,263 --> 00:14:28,864
[SPEAKER_10]: We put a 12 on the box.

238
00:14:29,204 --> 00:14:30,705
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, that's really all it is.

239
00:14:31,605 --> 00:14:34,807
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it's okay.

240
00:14:34,927 --> 00:14:36,227
[SPEAKER_10]: It's somewhat fun.

241
00:14:36,307 --> 00:14:37,948
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't played through everything yet.

242
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:42,590
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, you're looking at what was on the original Super Nintendo version.

243
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:46,152
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry, it's even less content than that.

244
00:14:46,172 --> 00:14:51,954
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, you really couldn't, you know, bother to put the extra content in there.

245
00:14:52,134 --> 00:14:54,395
[SPEAKER_10]: They don't even, like, remove, like, the landing pads and stuff like that.

246
00:14:54,415 --> 00:14:55,716
[SPEAKER_10]: They're in the different missions and stuff.

247
00:14:55,996 --> 00:14:56,877
[SPEAKER_10]: They're in the free mode.

248
00:14:56,917 --> 00:15:03,082
[SPEAKER_10]: They're just all sitting there still because they didn't bother to even say, okay, well, during this mode, this isn't here or whatever.

249
00:15:03,142 --> 00:15:04,443
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just, it's always there.

250
00:15:05,144 --> 00:15:07,986
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me get some questions from our chat room at chat.orangeandre.com.

251
00:15:08,047 --> 00:15:11,229
[SPEAKER_09]: Robert M is asking, Loki, Loki, can you shoot in Pilotwings?

252
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:13,051
[SPEAKER_09]: No balloon popping at least?

253
00:15:13,251 --> 00:15:16,054
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a few levels in the mission mode where you can do that.

254
00:15:16,754 --> 00:15:17,655
[SPEAKER_09]: Shooting or balloon popping?

255
00:15:18,035 --> 00:15:18,295
[SPEAKER_09]: Or both?

256
00:15:18,696 --> 00:15:18,816
[SPEAKER_09]: Both.

257
00:15:18,836 --> 00:15:19,116
[SPEAKER_09]: Or neither?

258
00:15:19,136 --> 00:15:19,557
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

259
00:15:19,577 --> 00:15:19,697
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

260
00:15:20,918 --> 00:15:25,200
[SPEAKER_09]: Tiger Claw is asking what they should have done is recreated that helicopter mission from the first Pilotwings.

261
00:15:25,781 --> 00:15:28,042
[SPEAKER_09]: Most people never even saw those missions.

262
00:15:28,603 --> 00:15:30,104
[SPEAKER_09]: The first Pilotwings was hard.

263
00:15:30,624 --> 00:15:35,167
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, they've got some stuff that's undocumented or whatever.

264
00:15:35,187 --> 00:15:38,269
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not on the box where they have the squirrel suit or whatever.

265
00:15:38,349 --> 00:15:40,531
[SPEAKER_10]: You could do skydiving in there.

266
00:15:40,931 --> 00:15:42,192
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, the squirrel suit?

267
00:15:42,472 --> 00:15:43,092
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

268
00:16:06,138 --> 00:16:09,040
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm literally imagining a skydiving squirrel.

269
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,961
[SPEAKER_10]: It would be cool if it was a skydiving squirrel.

270
00:16:12,001 --> 00:16:14,322
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I'd pay to play that.

271
00:16:14,742 --> 00:16:17,364
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's just, I don't know.

272
00:16:18,384 --> 00:16:20,545
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a fun game, I guess.

273
00:16:20,765 --> 00:16:29,470
[SPEAKER_10]: It's what I've been playing just because I just want to play through some of that because I've played Ridge Racer like a ton and Street Fighter, you know, it's all right.

274
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:38,275
[SPEAKER_09]: I saw a question about the battery life earlier in chat, and that's a bitch I've heard as well, is that the battery life isn't really that great on these things.

275
00:16:38,355 --> 00:16:39,816
[SPEAKER_09]: What has been your experience with the battery?

276
00:16:40,437 --> 00:16:45,320
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't really had a problem with it because I keep charging it all the time, but I've never had it run out on me.

277
00:16:46,521 --> 00:16:53,425
[SPEAKER_10]: But then again, I also don't leave it in sleep mode because I figured that the battery would go dead and I kind of want to play the game.

278
00:16:54,026 --> 00:16:59,750
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the thing, is they have all these things that rely on sleep mode, and I know that doesn't suck as much battery as playing a game would,

279
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:05,752
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, if it's running out of battery that fast, then why rely on sleep mode for all this stuff?

280
00:17:07,612 --> 00:17:09,673
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me go to another question from chat, and I think this is a good one.

281
00:17:10,033 --> 00:17:17,575
[SPEAKER_09]: Savalas in our chatroom is asking, at chat.homersonstrider.com, Loki, do you have buyer's remorse with buying the Nintendo 3DS now that we're a week in?

282
00:17:18,355 --> 00:17:18,975
[SPEAKER_10]: No, not really.

283
00:17:20,316 --> 00:17:22,716
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I got the few games that I wanted to get, and that's it.

284
00:17:22,836 --> 00:17:24,857
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's what I'm going to plan on getting until...

285
00:17:26,482 --> 00:17:26,902
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

286
00:17:46,628 --> 00:18:06,540
[SPEAKER_10]: and a lot of it you know even the reviewers go this is basically the game that you know came up before but now it's in 3d and it doesn't really utilize 3d that much and you're going to get a lot of that stuff because people don't know how to utilize it or they're going to try to you know cash in real quick especially putting out like a budget game because all the games are $40 so a $20 game stands out because hey that's uh much cheaper but

287
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:08,531
[SPEAKER_10]: GameDev Story GameDev Story

288
00:18:26,131 --> 00:18:40,391
[SPEAKER_10]: Even the fictional company that's the game publisher of the actual game, their toilet system is not doing well compared to my glory hole system.

289
00:18:40,471 --> 00:18:42,875
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, that's what's called the glory hole system.

290
00:18:45,819 --> 00:18:47,219
[SPEAKER_10]: Everybody loves a glory hole, so.

291
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:47,960
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

292
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,380
[SPEAKER_10]: And then Grand Theft Auto.

293
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,441
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's what I played this week.

294
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:52,181
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

295
00:18:52,321 --> 00:18:53,541
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me go over to Salacious Pop.

296
00:18:53,581 --> 00:18:54,421
[SPEAKER_09]: How was your gaming week?

297
00:18:54,821 --> 00:18:55,322
[SPEAKER_06]: It was all right.

298
00:18:56,022 --> 00:18:56,522
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty slow.

299
00:18:57,702 --> 00:19:09,525
[SPEAKER_06]: Played some Pac-Man Championship Edition DX, some Super Street Fighter IV, a lot of the Mortal Kombat PS3 demo, and I finally got to play Marvel vs. Capcom 3.

300
00:19:10,126 --> 00:19:11,286
[SPEAKER_09]: What did you think of MVC3?

301
00:19:12,556 --> 00:19:13,677
[SPEAKER_06]: I really liked what I saw of it.

302
00:19:13,737 --> 00:19:15,038
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely want to get it at some point.

303
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:22,882
[SPEAKER_06]: It has the sort of hybrid four-button controls that the Dreamcast used for Marvel vs. Capcom 2.

304
00:19:23,643 --> 00:19:27,125
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I guess also Tatsunoko vs. Capcom for the Wii uses something similar.

305
00:19:28,085 --> 00:19:51,902
[SPEAKER_06]: and I didn't realize that it played like that so when I was using a six button fight pad I wasn't quite landing the combos that I thought I was because I realized oh well not all the buttons are mapped the way I thought they were there's no you know low medium strong punch low medium strong kick it's they're kind of combined some of them so yeah I loved it it was great was there a particular character you really enjoyed

306
00:19:53,423 --> 00:20:05,582
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't really care for her in the context that she appears in the Marvel Universe, but the female Wolverine clone, X-23 I think her name is, she was fun to use.

307
00:20:06,603 --> 00:20:06,804
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool?

308
00:20:07,024 --> 00:20:07,184
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

309
00:20:07,685 --> 00:20:09,067
[SPEAKER_09]: Anything else you want to share about your game of the week?

310
00:20:12,361 --> 00:20:18,904
[SPEAKER_06]: The fatalities in the Mortal Kombat demo are really gory, but they're all kind of stupid and they're all kind of the same.

311
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:20,205
[SPEAKER_06]: You think?

312
00:20:20,505 --> 00:20:20,745
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

313
00:20:21,766 --> 00:20:32,311
[SPEAKER_09]: See, here's my whole thing is that I... You know I hate the Saw movies and all that stuff and I talk about this on the show, but yet I giggle so much at Mortal Kombat and all the fatalities and some of them are really bad.

314
00:20:32,792 --> 00:20:35,433
[SPEAKER_09]: Like the Mileena one, what does Mileena do?

315
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:38,835
[SPEAKER_09]: She walks up to you like she's going to kiss you and then she...

316
00:20:39,515 --> 00:20:41,057
[SPEAKER_04]: Sucks you up and spits you out.

317
00:20:41,117 --> 00:20:43,800
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's not like you think that's what's going to happen because that's what happens to Olin.

318
00:20:44,181 --> 00:20:46,163
[SPEAKER_09]: But she like rips off your face.

319
00:20:46,283 --> 00:20:57,016
[SPEAKER_06]: She throws her size at you so they're out of your rib cage so you're all spiked and then she makes like this, I guess Melina's always horny or whatever because she's always moaning and cooing.

320
00:20:57,563 --> 00:21:05,907
[SPEAKER_06]: So it looks like she's going to kiss you and then she rips your head off at the jawline so that your chin and jaw is still attached and your body falls over.

321
00:21:06,247 --> 00:21:10,969
[SPEAKER_06]: Then she eats your tongue out of the head that she has in her hand.

322
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:13,591
[SPEAKER_06]: She doesn't just eat it.

323
00:21:13,611 --> 00:21:16,352
[SPEAKER_04]: She goes... She's got Baraka face.

324
00:21:16,512 --> 00:21:20,814
[SPEAKER_06]: So she eats your tongue out of your severed head and then she just chucks it to the ground like a football.

325
00:21:20,854 --> 00:21:20,974
[SPEAKER_06]: Like...

326
00:21:22,675 --> 00:21:37,843
[SPEAKER_06]: and then she jumps on the camera and like kind of tries to dry hump it right well that's that's if you're that's her non like if you don't do a fatality you just let her fall down and then she like she like smears blood on her boobs because again she's always horny like I don't know what her problem is

327
00:21:39,122 --> 00:22:01,912
[SPEAKER_06]: but yet the whole time I see this for the first time I'm giggling maniacally and like Alan's like what's wrong with you and as soon as I know I don't really appreciate the whole TNA fighter game thing at all because as soon as I saw her buck naked outfit I'm like she's gonna get a yeast infection in that in that onesie she has a naked well it's like all she's not really naked she's wearing she's wearing floss oh like the Vampirella yeah she's wearing floss

328
00:22:02,907 --> 00:22:11,293
[SPEAKER_09]: And the best part is that, you know, this new Mortal Kombat game, like, the blood kind of seems to stay on the characters, and it stays, like, in kind of natural-looking ways.

329
00:22:11,573 --> 00:22:15,776
[SPEAKER_09]: So, like, you know, after she's fighting or whatever, her boobs will be, like, covered in blood, and she's, like, rubbing her boobs.

330
00:22:15,856 --> 00:22:18,958
[SPEAKER_09]: It's all, like, it's really, like, disgusting, but funny.

331
00:22:18,978 --> 00:22:20,059
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to bring this over.

332
00:22:20,519 --> 00:22:21,820
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just a PS3 demo.

333
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:22,700
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not the game yet.

334
00:22:23,261 --> 00:22:25,222
[SPEAKER_09]: Because the demo has four characters in it.

335
00:22:25,642 --> 00:22:30,546
[SPEAKER_06]: And the fatality for Scorpion, if you look it up in the op menu, is wrong.

336
00:22:31,446 --> 00:22:31,926
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah, yeah.

337
00:22:32,767 --> 00:22:34,428
[SPEAKER_09]: The fatality for Scorpion was just backwards.

338
00:22:34,888 --> 00:22:35,068
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

339
00:22:35,128 --> 00:22:35,629
[SPEAKER_09]: That was funny.

340
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:38,450
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, wait, hold on.

341
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:39,491
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I should do here?

342
00:22:39,551 --> 00:22:41,172
[SPEAKER_09]: I should actually just pull this up real quick.

343
00:22:41,432 --> 00:22:42,613
[SPEAKER_09]: It is a three hour show.

344
00:22:42,633 --> 00:22:43,894
[SPEAKER_09]: We have time to do some fun things here.

345
00:22:44,554 --> 00:22:47,356
[SPEAKER_09]: Describe Scorpion's fatality for us real quick because that was pretty funny too.

346
00:22:48,076 --> 00:23:09,681
[SPEAKER_06]: um he takes his katana and he slices your head off and then again at the waist but he does it so fast that it's obvious that it's going through you but you're still upright and then he kicks your stomach so your middle piece flies back so then your legs fall and your head goes up in the air and then he cuts your head in half like a like a cantaloupe

347
00:23:12,236 --> 00:23:15,298
[SPEAKER_10]: I love the fruit ninja reference there.

348
00:23:16,098 --> 00:23:17,439
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, here you go, DarkSakura.

349
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:17,799
[SPEAKER_09]: You ready?

350
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:18,920
[SPEAKER_09]: Here you go.

351
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:19,460
[SPEAKER_09]: Enjoy.

352
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:29,426
[SPEAKER_09]: That is... See, she's all sexy walking and then... Give me a kiss, boy.

353
00:23:30,486 --> 00:23:30,767
[SPEAKER_09]: Psych.

354
00:23:38,061 --> 00:23:45,107
[SPEAKER_08]: seeing that she's all like rubbing her boobs she's all mmm I just ate that guy's tongue that's the best fatality ever there you go

355
00:23:50,785 --> 00:23:55,666
[SPEAKER_09]: See, Mortal Kombat, I gotta admit, I gave the demo an unfavorable review a couple weeks ago.

356
00:23:55,866 --> 00:23:57,346
[SPEAKER_09]: It is growing on me a little bit.

357
00:23:57,906 --> 00:23:59,307
[SPEAKER_09]: It's growing on me just a little bit.

358
00:23:59,447 --> 00:24:11,769
[SPEAKER_09]: I think having seen some more of the fatalities and getting to do, like, kind of getting more comfortable with the fighting system, because, you know, they took out the whole weapon thing and all that's gone now, so it's a little bit back to old school, and, you know, kind of getting used to that again.

359
00:24:11,849 --> 00:24:12,489
[SPEAKER_09]: It's growing on me.

360
00:24:12,569 --> 00:24:19,511
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I will get the full version, so I can do more fatalities, and Salacious Pop can be very disappointed with me.

361
00:24:19,531 --> 00:24:19,591
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

362
00:24:20,271 --> 00:24:20,671
[SPEAKER_06]: and DarkSakura.com

363
00:24:48,377 --> 00:24:49,578
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to say that it hurt to look at.

364
00:24:49,758 --> 00:24:54,760
[SPEAKER_06]: It didn't give me a headache, but just running around, something was off about the graphics visually.

365
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,680
[SPEAKER_06]: It was hard to look at.

366
00:24:55,961 --> 00:24:56,361
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

367
00:24:56,481 --> 00:24:59,222
[SPEAKER_06]: But I was like, okay, this is God of War Castlevania and I just deleted it.

368
00:24:59,522 --> 00:25:00,923
[SPEAKER_10]: It originally wasn't a Castlevania game.

369
00:25:00,943 --> 00:25:02,464
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah, that's right.

370
00:25:02,484 --> 00:25:04,264
[SPEAKER_10]: It wasn't supposed to be a Castlevania game originally.

371
00:25:04,865 --> 00:25:08,486
[SPEAKER_06]: Why come out with a new IP when we can just slap Castlevania on it?

372
00:25:08,627 --> 00:25:09,047
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

373
00:25:09,887 --> 00:25:15,435
[SPEAKER_09]: SSJ100 Matt is in our chatroom talking about the Mortal Kombat demo and the fatalities saying, Rob, you should show your mom the game.

374
00:25:15,816 --> 00:25:17,979
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob, that's gross, Rob.

375
00:25:18,619 --> 00:25:20,863
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, that's a great idea for a future OLR YouTube.

376
00:25:20,883 --> 00:25:21,483
[SPEAKER_09]: She looks cold.

377
00:25:21,524 --> 00:25:22,325
[SPEAKER_09]: She needs a jacket.

378
00:25:22,345 --> 00:25:22,505
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

379
00:25:24,744 --> 00:25:25,684
[SPEAKER_09]: We will get right on that.

380
00:25:25,704 --> 00:25:27,685
[SPEAKER_09]: That sounds like a great future OLR YouTube.

381
00:25:28,406 --> 00:25:29,606
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob's mom plays Mortal Kombat.

382
00:25:29,666 --> 00:25:30,087
[SPEAKER_09]: That'd be fun.

383
00:25:30,527 --> 00:25:30,827
[SPEAKER_09]: Good times.

384
00:25:31,227 --> 00:25:32,368
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's see.

385
00:25:32,408 --> 00:25:32,968
[SPEAKER_09]: My Gaming Week.

386
00:25:33,028 --> 00:25:36,049
[SPEAKER_09]: I played a lot of the same stuff that Salacious Pop did, but there was some different things.

387
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:43,473
[SPEAKER_09]: One night, randomly, we were having You Don't Know Jack, which has kind of become this strange Friday tradition all of a sudden, which I'm kind of liking.

388
00:25:43,853 --> 00:25:45,834
[SPEAKER_09]: Friday night, playing You Don't Know Jack and drinking wine.

389
00:25:46,514 --> 00:25:49,716
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you need stronger booze, but yeah, the booze in You Don't Know Jack is good.

390
00:25:50,817 --> 00:25:51,677
[SPEAKER_06]: Wine keeps it classy.

391
00:25:51,977 --> 00:25:56,878
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, wine keeps it very classy with the fart jokes and you don't know Jack, which is always hilarious.

392
00:25:57,259 --> 00:25:59,139
[SPEAKER_09]: But then we just started playing like old school games.

393
00:25:59,719 --> 00:26:05,141
[SPEAKER_09]: And when I say old school, I mean like old school on the Xbox Live Arcade and some things they don't even sell anymore.

394
00:26:05,181 --> 00:26:06,481
[SPEAKER_09]: We were playing Smash TV.

395
00:26:07,382 --> 00:26:16,364
[SPEAKER_09]: We were playing the Mortal Kombat 3 Ultimate, the arcade one that was on Xbox Live that's not there anymore.

396
00:26:16,684 --> 00:26:18,645
[SPEAKER_09]: So we were kind of having fun just playing some of those old games and

397
00:26:19,245 --> 00:26:23,627
[SPEAKER_09]: It's neat because you can kind of see how far along the Xbox Live Arcade really has come.

398
00:26:23,807 --> 00:26:27,008
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it really was just a bunch of ports in the beginning, and some of them weren't done very well.

399
00:26:27,348 --> 00:26:35,772
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, looking back, now going back and playing the Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, I'm kind of like, well, where's the move list in the game?

400
00:26:36,012 --> 00:26:41,314
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just literally the ROM just dumped and sold on Xbox Live Arcade.

401
00:26:41,334 --> 00:26:43,575
[SPEAKER_09]: So they have come a ways a little bit since then.

402
00:26:43,755 --> 00:26:52,720
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, I think back to some of the episodes we were doing back then, and I seem to remember we were complaining about that a lot, that a lot of the releases were just ROMs being dumped on Xbox Live Arcade.

403
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:55,381
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think Microsoft tried to fix that after the first year or two.

404
00:26:55,461 --> 00:26:56,762
[SPEAKER_09]: They said, okay, no more of that.

405
00:26:57,002 --> 00:26:58,282
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they added a pause feature.

406
00:26:59,083 --> 00:27:00,423
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, well.

407
00:27:00,904 --> 00:27:01,944
[SPEAKER_06]: Excuse me, princess.

408
00:27:02,004 --> 00:27:04,245
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not entirely the arcade ROM.

409
00:27:04,285 --> 00:27:05,506
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I get what you're saying, though, but that's.

410
00:27:05,666 --> 00:27:12,251
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, well, remember, like, we were playing Mortal Kombat 3, and for some reason, I could remember Kabal combos.

411
00:27:12,291 --> 00:27:14,493
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, Kabal was the character I used to use in Mortal Kombat all the time.

412
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:18,996
[SPEAKER_09]: And I remember how to make him do the spinny thing, and then punch, punch, uppercut, little laser purple pew-pew beam.

413
00:27:19,416 --> 00:27:20,397
[SPEAKER_09]: I could do all that still.

414
00:27:20,697 --> 00:27:23,159
[SPEAKER_09]: Yet, when it came to fatality time, couldn't remember how to do it.

415
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,141
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm like, well, let me pause and go to the move list.

416
00:27:25,301 --> 00:27:26,262
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, there is no move list.

417
00:27:26,722 --> 00:27:29,204
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just pause and reconfigure the buttons, or quit.

418
00:27:29,424 --> 00:27:29,844
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just...

419
00:27:30,905 --> 00:27:34,829
[SPEAKER_09]: So, we had to go on GameFAQs to get the fatality, but then we were like, eh, too lazy to do that.

420
00:27:34,849 --> 00:27:36,070
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's just play something else.

421
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:37,031
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's play Smash TV.

422
00:27:38,312 --> 00:27:39,973
[SPEAKER_09]: I will say one new game I played this week.

423
00:27:42,476 --> 00:27:47,000
[SPEAKER_09]: I played a free game that's now available on the PlayStation 3 called Free Realms.

424
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,241
[SPEAKER_09]: Ha, ha, ha.

425
00:27:48,661 --> 00:27:53,986
[SPEAKER_09]: Free Realms is a free MMO that is available on the PlayStation 3 and that's what they're calling it.

426
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:54,667
[SPEAKER_09]: Freemium.

427
00:27:55,167 --> 00:27:55,508
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a what?

428
00:27:55,708 --> 00:27:56,228
[SPEAKER_09]: A freemium.

429
00:27:56,248 --> 00:27:57,369
[SPEAKER_09]: A freemium MMO.

430
00:27:58,731 --> 00:28:03,195
[SPEAKER_09]: And you download this 25 meg file and first I was like, oh shit, this thing's small.

431
00:28:03,235 --> 00:28:04,096
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a small game.

432
00:28:04,396 --> 00:28:08,980
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, so I launch the game only to wait and download 700 more megabytes.

433
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:09,701
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, fine.

434
00:28:09,861 --> 00:28:10,822
[SPEAKER_10]: Ah, it's PlayStation Home.

435
00:28:11,102 --> 00:28:13,445
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'll go in the other room and play WoW and then come back in an hour.

436
00:28:14,065 --> 00:28:16,446
[SPEAKER_09]: So finally I get in there and it's like, choose your character.

437
00:28:16,506 --> 00:28:18,706
[SPEAKER_09]: And you can do little character customizations.

438
00:28:18,746 --> 00:28:19,526
[SPEAKER_10]: You chose this character.

439
00:28:19,686 --> 00:28:21,007
[SPEAKER_09]: Now I'll need to download that character.

440
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:23,747
[SPEAKER_09]: You can either be, no, that was the last time I downloaded it.

441
00:28:23,767 --> 00:28:27,868
[SPEAKER_09]: But you can either be a male or female and you can be a human or you can be a fairy.

442
00:28:28,828 --> 00:28:34,570
[SPEAKER_09]: So of course I rolled a man fairy because I figured nobody was going to be playing those in the game.

443
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:35,410
[SPEAKER_09]: So it would be kind of funny.

444
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:39,911
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, you could, and don't you dare be making jokes because I'll beat you.

445
00:28:40,251 --> 00:28:42,613
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, so anyway, I rolled the character.

446
00:28:43,053 --> 00:28:47,996
[SPEAKER_09]: You can do a custom name, but if you do a custom name, then it has to go to be approved.

447
00:28:48,637 --> 00:28:52,179
[SPEAKER_09]: So you have to choose a name from this slot machine thing.

448
00:28:52,219 --> 00:28:56,122
[SPEAKER_09]: They have all these pre-approved names, a first name, like a middle name, and a last name.

449
00:28:56,582 --> 00:29:01,545
[SPEAKER_09]: I think my name ended up being like Rob, like Forest Tree or something.

450
00:29:01,565 --> 00:29:02,686
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't remember, something really dumb.

451
00:29:03,106 --> 00:29:04,967
[SPEAKER_09]: So I went in there, whatever.

452
00:29:05,548 --> 00:29:06,609
[SPEAKER_09]: And then it's just, okay.

453
00:29:07,469 --> 00:29:08,450
[SPEAKER_09]: Now you're in free realms.

454
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:08,930
[SPEAKER_09]: Have fun.

455
00:29:09,591 --> 00:29:10,372
[SPEAKER_09]: No tutorial.

456
00:29:10,892 --> 00:29:11,513
[SPEAKER_09]: No setup.

457
00:29:12,173 --> 00:29:12,794
[SPEAKER_09]: No nothing.

458
00:29:13,134 --> 00:29:15,496
[SPEAKER_09]: Just, okay, here you are.

459
00:29:15,616 --> 00:29:15,797
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

460
00:29:15,817 --> 00:29:16,537
[SPEAKER_09]: Tutorial?

461
00:29:16,617 --> 00:29:17,038
[SPEAKER_09]: What is this?

462
00:29:17,538 --> 00:29:18,519
[SPEAKER_09]: A paid game?

463
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:22,042
[SPEAKER_09]: So I was like, okay, well, I kind of figured it out, I think.

464
00:29:22,482 --> 00:29:25,265
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, I went around and figured out how to start mining.

465
00:29:25,585 --> 00:29:27,127
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was like, okay, I'm going to mine.

466
00:29:27,467 --> 00:29:30,430
[SPEAKER_09]: So the mining game is kind of like, I don't know, it's like...

467
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:32,491
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a game like that on Gaia.

468
00:29:32,831 --> 00:29:35,734
[SPEAKER_09]: It sounds like Puzzle Quest 2 when you have to pick lock a chest or bash open a door.

469
00:29:35,754 --> 00:29:36,594
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a sort of

470
00:29:50,385 --> 00:29:52,427
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching!

471
00:30:08,019 --> 00:30:18,029
[SPEAKER_09]: and I noticed that in the quest, if you did not want to try to find the NPC that's the next step of the quest, you could just hit R2 and your character would just auto-fly there.

472
00:30:18,189 --> 00:30:19,050
[SPEAKER_09]: I fly because I'm a fairy.

473
00:30:19,891 --> 00:30:21,733
[SPEAKER_09]: You just auto-fly there or whatever.

474
00:30:22,414 --> 00:30:24,235
[SPEAKER_09]: And okay, so it made it really easy.

475
00:30:24,516 --> 00:30:25,517
[SPEAKER_09]: So I kind of figured it out.

476
00:30:25,557 --> 00:30:27,138
[SPEAKER_09]: This MMO is really for kids.

477
00:30:27,439 --> 00:30:28,500
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a kid's MMO.

478
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,161
[SPEAKER_06]: How many people were wandering around...

479
00:30:31,102 --> 00:30:32,143
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, I didn't try to chat.

480
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:33,404
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to talk to these people.

481
00:30:33,464 --> 00:30:35,666
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to figure out what the game is.

482
00:30:35,726 --> 00:30:39,169
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I gathered it is a bunch of mini-games thrown together to make an MMO.

483
00:30:56,044 --> 00:30:56,744
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if you saw...

484
00:31:17,972 --> 00:31:22,797
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like saying, well our game is actually really, really similar to Minecraft.

485
00:31:22,857 --> 00:31:24,238
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, what?

486
00:31:24,778 --> 00:31:26,220
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it was nothing like Minecraft.

487
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:32,145
[SPEAKER_10]: But apparently the house building or some crap in there is similar to Minecraft, but not.

488
00:31:32,225 --> 00:31:36,089
[SPEAKER_09]: You can customize your house, but it struck me a little more Animal Crossing than it did Minecraft.

489
00:31:36,169 --> 00:31:37,170
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not Minecraft.

490
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:38,131
[SPEAKER_09]: He's just stupid.

491
00:31:38,191 --> 00:31:40,073
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, and here's the other thing, folks.

492
00:31:40,553 --> 00:31:45,096
[SPEAKER_09]: Once I got to like the fourth level of mining, it was like, do you want to play more mining?

493
00:31:45,377 --> 00:31:47,779
[SPEAKER_09]: Become a member today of Free Realms.

494
00:31:47,819 --> 00:31:48,359
[SPEAKER_09]: So that was it.

495
00:31:48,919 --> 00:31:55,064
[SPEAKER_09]: So essentially, this MMO is just all these little mini games, but you can play all the mini games up to level four.

496
00:31:55,485 --> 00:31:57,206
[SPEAKER_09]: And then it's like, oh, you got to be a member.

497
00:31:57,326 --> 00:31:58,287
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's Sodium One.

498
00:31:58,627 --> 00:31:59,527
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, basically.

499
00:31:59,868 --> 00:32:03,029
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I'm sorry, that's not a free MMO.

500
00:32:03,489 --> 00:32:06,290
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a demo of a pay MMO.

501
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:11,632
[SPEAKER_09]: This is another instance of a game company using deceptive terms to market their product.

502
00:32:11,932 --> 00:32:14,333
[SPEAKER_09]: Because a lot of people are probably going to check this out because it's a free MMO.

503
00:32:14,353 --> 00:32:16,334
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm here to tell you it is not a free MMO.

504
00:32:16,674 --> 00:32:19,115
[SPEAKER_09]: It is a demo of an MMO.

505
00:32:19,135 --> 00:32:20,956
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know what their defense would be is that...

506
00:32:21,656 --> 00:32:28,223
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, once you capitalize, you can still be in the world and you can still talk to people and you can still customize your fairy.

507
00:32:28,443 --> 00:32:36,010
[SPEAKER_10]: And to their defense, and I hate going to their defense, but their defense actually is a pretty cheap MMO.

508
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:37,532
[SPEAKER_10]: $35 for a lifetime membership.

509
00:32:37,952 --> 00:32:40,515
[SPEAKER_10]: But once again, why would you want to do that?

510
00:32:42,079 --> 00:32:44,702
[SPEAKER_09]: Pay $0.99 and get the same games on the iPhone.

511
00:32:44,742 --> 00:32:46,243
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really the same deal.

512
00:32:46,263 --> 00:32:53,610
[SPEAKER_06]: $35 for a lifetime membership, but there's no reason to believe the longevity would be more than two years before they shut the servers down because no one's going to play it.

513
00:32:54,831 --> 00:32:55,392
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's the thing.

514
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:57,074
[SPEAKER_09]: I will give it this credit.

515
00:32:57,094 --> 00:32:59,036
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought it was kind of dopey.

516
00:32:59,236 --> 00:33:03,300
[SPEAKER_09]: I played it maybe twice, and I was like, okay, I think I've done everything there is to do in this game.

517
00:33:04,021 --> 00:33:05,624
[SPEAKER_09]: I see it more like a kid's MMO.

518
00:33:05,844 --> 00:33:09,632
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's where they've obviously taken a lot of safety precautions.

519
00:33:09,712 --> 00:33:11,074
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of it's kind of watered down.

520
00:33:11,135 --> 00:33:12,638
[SPEAKER_09]: I think this is something more for kids.

521
00:33:13,018 --> 00:33:15,744
[SPEAKER_09]: But here is where they screwed it royally.

522
00:33:16,325 --> 00:33:17,506
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no tutorial.

523
00:33:17,586 --> 00:33:21,709
[SPEAKER_09]: There's nothing to kind of help you understand what you're supposed to do in this game.

524
00:33:22,189 --> 00:33:26,292
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think a lot of kids would get really frustrated with it.

525
00:33:26,632 --> 00:33:28,453
[SPEAKER_09]: I think this would really have to be right.

526
00:33:28,493 --> 00:33:30,334
[SPEAKER_09]: I think there's a very specific age range.

527
00:33:30,374 --> 00:33:36,499
[SPEAKER_09]: It's probably like 10 to 13 year old girls I think would enjoy Free Realms and maybe some boys.

528
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:37,339
[SPEAKER_09]: But I don't know.

529
00:33:37,459 --> 00:33:41,082
[SPEAKER_09]: Just just strikes me as more of a girly game because there's not a lot of violence.

530
00:33:41,122 --> 00:33:42,683
[SPEAKER_09]: And yes, I'm being totally sexist right now.

531
00:33:43,343 --> 00:33:43,863
[SPEAKER_09]: Justine Beaver

532
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:09,383
[SPEAKER_06]: I assume Free Realms is the same on the PC as far as the freemium model.

533
00:34:09,403 --> 00:34:09,603
[SPEAKER_04]: I think so.

534
00:34:09,623 --> 00:34:09,723
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

535
00:34:09,763 --> 00:34:09,883
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

536
00:34:28,784 --> 00:34:30,747
[SPEAKER_09]: I wasn't really motivated to go check.

537
00:34:30,767 --> 00:34:31,447
[SPEAKER_09]: You'll have to excuse me.

538
00:34:31,467 --> 00:34:42,760
[SPEAKER_10]: I think this is not necessarily... I mean, granted, it's a way... I think it's going to get a lot of exposure to people that might not normally try it because it's integrated with the PlayStation Network and it's...

539
00:34:43,621 --> 00:35:08,126
[SPEAKER_10]: technically free to start playing it, but it can also be used as kind of data for them because they're working on a new EverQuest, they're working on some other, I forget what else, there's another IP that they're working on a sequel for that's also an MMO, but work on this to see what works, what doesn't work, and it's a good way, imagine if EverQuest came out the next one as a

540
00:35:09,367 --> 00:35:09,607
[SPEAKER_10]: Home,

541
00:35:28,724 --> 00:35:29,565
[SPEAKER_09]: and DarkSakura.com.

542
00:35:51,346 --> 00:35:51,787
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.com

543
00:36:06,608 --> 00:36:35,156
[SPEAKER_09]: so I don't know it strikes me as odd that they're and I realize it's different development teams Sony's a huge company and the free realms already existed in some regard on the PC so I mean but it just seems weird to me that home after all these years still I don't see the point of logging in to home regularly there's nothing for me to really check every day I don't know so anyhow that was my gaming week talked a lot about free realms and you know some of the other mini things or something like that in free realms

544
00:36:35,576 --> 00:36:38,397
[SPEAKER_09]: I think they have guilds.

545
00:36:38,437 --> 00:36:40,398
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you invite the people to your house?

546
00:36:40,798 --> 00:36:42,539
[SPEAKER_09]: Your guild members to your house?

547
00:36:43,579 --> 00:36:45,340
[SPEAKER_09]: Honestly, Loki, I didn't play that far.

548
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:48,921
[SPEAKER_10]: You probably can, and that's more people that can come to your house than fucking home.

549
00:36:49,421 --> 00:36:49,902
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.

550
00:36:49,962 --> 00:36:50,982
[SPEAKER_09]: Way to go, Sony.

551
00:36:51,022 --> 00:36:51,642
[SPEAKER_09]: Bravo.

552
00:36:52,563 --> 00:36:59,045
[SPEAKER_09]: I am confident in saying, though, that if there are TVs in free realms, you can't put videos or pictures on them, just like home.

553
00:36:59,525 --> 00:37:00,706
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm pretty confident in saying that.

554
00:37:02,447 --> 00:37:05,229
[SPEAKER_10]: That still doesn't matter if no one can see them.

555
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:07,712
[SPEAKER_10]: Only so many people can come to your house.

556
00:37:07,792 --> 00:37:08,833
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, sorry.

557
00:37:09,574 --> 00:37:15,359
[SPEAKER_10]: If we have any more people in this house, it's going to violate the fire code and the marshal's going to come down here.

558
00:37:15,419 --> 00:37:16,921
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't want any of that stuff.

559
00:37:17,001 --> 00:37:19,763
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, just don't want to mess with that.

560
00:37:20,604 --> 00:37:21,645
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's move on.

561
00:37:21,665 --> 00:37:23,606
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to get into some actual video game news here.

562
00:37:23,666 --> 00:37:27,349
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, our chatroom, chat.orangeloungeradio.com if you want to join us live on this Sunday evening.

563
00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:34,294
[SPEAKER_09]: Real quick housekeeping, I may not be here in a couple weeks, so we may have a guest host in a couple weeks.

564
00:37:34,314 --> 00:37:35,675
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, I've talked to the other hosts about that.

565
00:37:35,775 --> 00:37:37,357
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not going to be here in a couple weeks.

566
00:37:37,637 --> 00:37:38,257
[SPEAKER_09]: Which week's that?

567
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:38,618
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that the 17th?

568
00:37:39,558 --> 00:37:39,919
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

569
00:37:40,579 --> 00:37:42,381
[SPEAKER_09]: But maybe we're not going to be here at all that week.

570
00:37:42,421 --> 00:37:42,981
[SPEAKER_09]: Where are you going to be?

571
00:37:43,101 --> 00:37:45,963
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not going to be anywhere, but my wife's going to be somewhere, so I've got to watch the baby.

572
00:37:46,043 --> 00:37:46,804
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, gotcha.

573
00:37:46,864 --> 00:37:47,805
[SPEAKER_09]: She's going to a wedding.

574
00:37:47,925 --> 00:37:54,811
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, then I'm going to safely say we are probably not going to be here at all on the 17th, which is in two weeks, because that is also the night I need to be out.

575
00:37:55,031 --> 00:37:57,853
[SPEAKER_10]: I am going in for Mensa testing, though, on the 16th, which is pretty awesome.

576
00:37:57,873 --> 00:37:58,634
[SPEAKER_09]: Mensa testing?

577
00:37:58,674 --> 00:37:59,634
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, Mensa testing.

578
00:38:00,255 --> 00:38:01,596
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I have to know more about this.

579
00:38:01,656 --> 00:38:03,017
[SPEAKER_09]: Why are you taking the Mensa test?

580
00:38:03,377 --> 00:38:04,038
[SPEAKER_09]: It's fun.

581
00:38:04,298 --> 00:38:04,899
[SPEAKER_09]: Just for what...

582
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:10,505
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you just sit there and you were just kind of like watching the Food Network and then suddenly it just dawns on you, I should take the Mensa test.

583
00:38:10,545 --> 00:38:11,365
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't even remember what it was.

584
00:38:12,006 --> 00:38:16,711
[SPEAKER_10]: Somehow I got directed to the test that's on their website and I did really well on that.

585
00:38:17,212 --> 00:38:24,339
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been playing around with their iPhone app and I was just like, eh, this is all good and all, but I want to actually try the real test.

586
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:24,760
[SPEAKER_10]: And

587
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:33,542
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, even just looking at what questions, I mean, obviously the questions in the app aren't necessarily the same questions, but they have the similar types of questions.

588
00:38:33,802 --> 00:38:41,544
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't see how it's really a valid IQ test, because you really only have to be good at answering certain types of questions, and that's it.

589
00:38:41,724 --> 00:38:42,604
[SPEAKER_09]: Only you, Loki.

590
00:38:42,704 --> 00:38:44,244
[SPEAKER_09]: This is so typical of you on the show.

591
00:38:44,504 --> 00:38:49,105
[SPEAKER_09]: You're openly questioning why anyone would want to become a Mensa member, yet you're scheduled to take the test.

592
00:38:49,165 --> 00:38:51,106
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I just want to... I just want... Hey, no, hey.

593
00:38:51,986 --> 00:38:59,212
[SPEAKER_10]: Listen, I just want to try it just for the hell of it, and hey, if I'm accepted into it, great, that's something else to put on my resume.

594
00:39:01,934 --> 00:39:03,235
[SPEAKER_10]: Whatever, it doesn't matter.

595
00:39:03,315 --> 00:39:04,957
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to take the Mensa test.

596
00:39:04,977 --> 00:39:05,537
[SPEAKER_10]: You should.

597
00:39:06,498 --> 00:39:07,359
[SPEAKER_10]: It's 40 bucks.

598
00:39:07,659 --> 00:39:08,319
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not that bad.

599
00:39:08,339 --> 00:39:09,740
[SPEAKER_10]: 40 bucks and you got to go to a, there's a guy.

600
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,582
[SPEAKER_09]: That's how much brain age costs, right?

601
00:39:11,602 --> 00:39:17,867
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a guy that does it once a month down in Dixon, and you just go down there and you go take the test, it's an hour and a half, and that's it.

602
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,721
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think Rob should take it.

603
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:22,121
[SPEAKER_06]: Why?

604
00:39:22,141 --> 00:39:23,802
[SPEAKER_06]: Because then I'm going to fail and I'm going to cry?

605
00:39:23,882 --> 00:39:24,343
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that why?

606
00:39:25,163 --> 00:39:38,972
[SPEAKER_06]: If you pass, whatever sort of weird, totally irrational opinion you ever have in your life, politically or for anything else, well, I'm a member of Mensa, so I think maybe that my opinion is a bit more important than yours.

607
00:39:38,992 --> 00:39:43,535
[SPEAKER_10]: All you have to be good at, I mean, seriously, it's mostly math and it's mostly pattern finding.

608
00:39:43,835 --> 00:39:50,597
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you can find patterns and kind of think a little bit out of the box, I guess, that's it.

609
00:39:50,997 --> 00:39:51,877
[SPEAKER_10]: You'll be fine.

610
00:39:53,718 --> 00:39:57,919
[SPEAKER_10]: Once again, I still don't understand how it's really a valid... Whatever, though.

611
00:39:58,099 --> 00:39:58,759
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll take the test.

612
00:39:59,399 --> 00:40:07,321
[SPEAKER_10]: I probably won't qualify because you have to be in the 98th percentile of the United States in order to be accepted in there.

613
00:40:07,381 --> 00:40:10,622
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'd assume that's probably close to getting everything correctly.

614
00:40:10,762 --> 00:40:11,583
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

615
00:40:28,962 --> 00:40:56,188
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know about that they have dating though like a dating thing you can date other Mensa members it's stupid but it'd be cool to put on like you know to get the little you know award or whatever the hell they have they're all hey you've been accepted in you know that'd be kind of cool but you know beyond do I really want to be like a functioning member fuck that I don't want to be a member of that society well now are you going to get excommunicated from Mensa if any of the members hear this program eh no

616
00:40:58,095 --> 00:41:02,557
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I've had... I used to get letters all the time to go take the test.

617
00:41:03,137 --> 00:41:06,698
[SPEAKER_04]: I never wanted to do it because I thought it was stupid and pretentious.

618
00:41:06,718 --> 00:41:08,039
[SPEAKER_09]: All these fucking smart people.

619
00:41:08,099 --> 00:41:13,901
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just sitting here going... If you can bring your Mensa card to Cold Stone and get a buck off, it's like, yeah, hell yeah.

620
00:41:14,261 --> 00:41:17,523
[SPEAKER_06]: Free side of pancakes at Denny's because fucking Mensa card.

621
00:41:17,543 --> 00:41:18,543
[SPEAKER_06]: Hell yeah.

622
00:41:19,203 --> 00:41:20,244
[SPEAKER_06]: Smart people got it going on.

623
00:41:20,264 --> 00:41:21,404
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, is Mensa like AAA?

624
00:41:21,424 --> 00:41:22,104
[SPEAKER_09]: Will they come change my tire?

625
00:41:22,124 --> 00:41:22,885
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think it's like AAA.

626
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:26,780
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

627
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:27,581
[SPEAKER_10]: So we'll see.

628
00:41:27,681 --> 00:41:29,142
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see what ends up happening there.

629
00:41:30,983 --> 00:41:32,044
[SPEAKER_10]: I probably won't pass it.

630
00:41:32,224 --> 00:41:36,987
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, because there's a certain type of question from playing the game.

631
00:41:37,027 --> 00:41:39,569
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a certain type of question that stumps me, usually.

632
00:41:40,009 --> 00:41:43,352
[SPEAKER_10]: It's because a lot of it, and they only do certain types.

633
00:41:43,512 --> 00:41:49,516
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a few rows of numbers, and at the very end, there's four rows of four.

634
00:41:49,856 --> 00:41:52,718
[SPEAKER_10]: And you're supposed to figure out what the pattern is between all of them.

635
00:41:53,018 --> 00:41:53,559
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

636
00:42:12,919 --> 00:42:16,881
[SPEAKER_10]: Although I've gone back, though, and actually looked at some of these and go, okay, so that's how they're doing it.

637
00:42:17,121 --> 00:42:23,825
[SPEAKER_10]: And you find, you know, I don't know if it's breaking the test or anything, but you find there's certain patterns to the way they ask questions and stuff.

638
00:42:23,865 --> 00:42:26,566
[SPEAKER_10]: And, okay, I got to look for these types of things.

639
00:42:26,767 --> 00:42:27,367
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, there it is.

640
00:42:27,787 --> 00:42:29,048
[SPEAKER_10]: And away you go.

641
00:42:29,648 --> 00:42:30,869
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I don't know.

642
00:42:31,649 --> 00:42:34,551
[SPEAKER_10]: It just sounds interesting, a challenge or something.

643
00:42:34,571 --> 00:42:34,931
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

644
00:42:35,031 --> 00:42:37,872
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I'm busy this month, but if you go next month, let me know.

645
00:42:37,912 --> 00:42:38,453
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll go with you.

646
00:42:38,473 --> 00:42:39,173
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's on the 16th.

647
00:42:39,353 --> 00:42:40,213
[SPEAKER_09]: This month.

648
00:42:40,374 --> 00:42:41,214
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a horrible day.

649
00:42:41,274 --> 00:42:41,974
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't do that day.

650
00:42:42,254 --> 00:42:42,535
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

651
00:42:42,615 --> 00:42:43,195
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe next month.

652
00:42:43,255 --> 00:42:43,495
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

653
00:42:44,295 --> 00:42:47,957
[SPEAKER_09]: Randy's in our chatroom at chat.orange.com and says, Sky at the Mensa test.

654
00:42:48,117 --> 00:42:49,438
[SPEAKER_09]: This is like brain age, right?

655
00:42:49,458 --> 00:42:49,978
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

656
00:42:50,378 --> 00:42:51,399
[SPEAKER_09]: This is me at the Mensa test.

657
00:42:51,699 --> 00:42:51,959
[SPEAKER_09]: Red.

658
00:42:52,639 --> 00:42:52,980
[SPEAKER_09]: Yellow.

659
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:53,980
[SPEAKER_09]: Blue.

660
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:55,181
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really... Blue.

661
00:42:55,501 --> 00:42:56,561
[SPEAKER_04]: A big... Bro!

662
00:42:57,622 --> 00:42:58,882
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really a big IQ test.

663
00:42:59,062 --> 00:42:59,142
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

664
00:42:59,162 --> 00:42:59,663
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all it is.

665
00:42:59,723 --> 00:42:59,943
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

666
00:43:01,063 --> 00:43:03,124
[SPEAKER_09]: I wasn't gifted and talented when I was a kid.

667
00:43:03,184 --> 00:43:04,285
[SPEAKER_09]: That counts for something, right?

668
00:43:04,305 --> 00:43:04,385
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

669
00:43:07,235 --> 00:43:32,864
[SPEAKER_09]: AkumaJP in our chatroom says just show them your boobs and that's it, pass I don't know if that would work I don't think that's how it works Alright, anyhow, let's move on Actually get into some gaming news tonight MensaTalk was way better than talking about the Twitter and the Facebook and all that I can just picture our mailbag now though filling up with emails You don't understand Mensa, you're very rude

670
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:36,479
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I understand it completely, I'm just, you know

671
00:43:38,183 --> 00:43:44,945
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to become a member, but I want to become a non-participating member of Mensa.

672
00:43:44,985 --> 00:43:46,645
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that too much to ask?

673
00:43:48,325 --> 00:43:49,666
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to be on the roster.

674
00:43:49,706 --> 00:43:51,446
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't necessarily want to go to the meetings.

675
00:43:51,466 --> 00:43:53,527
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't want to attend some Mensa conference.

676
00:43:53,767 --> 00:43:54,407
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't care.

677
00:43:54,687 --> 00:43:56,747
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't care about talking about political issues.

678
00:43:57,307 --> 00:43:59,828
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want the damn badge or whatever.

679
00:43:59,868 --> 00:44:00,888
[SPEAKER_09]: Just want it on your resume.

680
00:44:01,228 --> 00:44:02,129
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

681
00:44:02,149 --> 00:44:03,029
[SPEAKER_10]: How about gaming news?

682
00:44:03,069 --> 00:44:03,649
[SPEAKER_10]: Video games?

683
00:44:03,709 --> 00:44:03,949
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello.

684
00:44:04,349 --> 00:44:04,749
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

685
00:44:05,410 --> 00:44:12,315
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I guess I should be sad about this, but Mega Man Universe has been canceled.

686
00:44:12,355 --> 00:44:12,715
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.

687
00:44:12,735 --> 00:44:27,766
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the game that was basically kind of a remade Mega Man 2 with some customizable characters and user-created levels and really didn't look that great, in my opinion, but some people were really gung-ho about it.

688
00:44:28,147 --> 00:44:28,767
[SPEAKER_10]: It's canceled.

689
00:44:28,807 --> 00:44:29,248
[SPEAKER_10]: Too bad.

690
00:44:29,668 --> 00:44:30,188
[SPEAKER_10]: So sad.

691
00:44:30,548 --> 00:44:32,310
[SPEAKER_10]: Their decision, I guess, was...

692
00:44:34,211 --> 00:44:35,652
[SPEAKER_10]: Caused by various circumstances.

693
00:44:35,752 --> 00:44:37,713
[SPEAKER_10]: That's such a detailed explanation.

694
00:44:38,854 --> 00:44:47,579
[SPEAKER_10]: And, of course, they're saying that maybe that has to do with the departure of the Mega Man creator and, you know, the universe lead designer, Kenji Inafune.

695
00:44:50,621 --> 00:44:52,202
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I don't know.

696
00:44:53,563 --> 00:44:55,284
[SPEAKER_10]: It just looked like Mega Man powered up.

697
00:44:55,724 --> 00:44:55,904
[SPEAKER_10]: Just...

698
00:44:57,361 --> 00:45:06,625
[SPEAKER_10]: It looked interesting to me, so of course I'm a little bit disappointed that it got cancelled But at the same time, if the game really did suck, then they did the right thing

699
00:45:17,469 --> 00:45:18,350
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

700
00:45:40,826 --> 00:45:54,796
[SPEAKER_10]: All of the levels, all of the bosses, you know, something like that where you can have your customized character, but you're fighting, you know, how, I don't even know how many, you know, boss characters it would be, but just like, you know, almost a hundred, you know, different characters.

701
00:45:54,876 --> 00:45:57,597
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, remember when we only knew the title and nothing else?

702
00:45:57,738 --> 00:46:02,481
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what most people were speculating it was, is that, oh, Mega Man Universe is finally going to be that clusterfuck.

703
00:46:03,018 --> 00:46:04,879
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I mean, it would be really awesome.

704
00:46:04,959 --> 00:46:11,082
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, okay, well, let's see what, you know, this weapon does to this character from a different game, you know, and stuff like that.

705
00:46:11,102 --> 00:46:21,066
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it actually, if I remember correctly, I think Mega Man 2 did have that kind of in when you're going through the Wily stages where they had the old, you know, one characters and you had to figure out what weapons did what.

706
00:46:21,086 --> 00:46:23,087
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't believe the one characters ever showed up in two.

707
00:46:23,247 --> 00:46:24,868
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the two characters showed up in three.

708
00:46:25,248 --> 00:46:27,809
[SPEAKER_09]: You had to replay the stages, the corner stages in three.

709
00:46:28,389 --> 00:46:28,930
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember that.

710
00:46:28,970 --> 00:46:29,310
[SPEAKER_09]: It's weird.

711
00:46:30,010 --> 00:46:30,390
[SPEAKER_09]: Got it.

712
00:46:30,470 --> 00:46:30,710
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

713
00:46:31,171 --> 00:46:31,751
[SPEAKER_09]: I was close.

714
00:46:32,211 --> 00:46:33,152
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

715
00:46:55,546 --> 00:46:56,847
[SPEAKER_10]: I am very looking forward to that.

716
00:46:57,387 --> 00:46:58,287
[SPEAKER_10]: Legends was awesome.

717
00:46:59,408 --> 00:47:01,489
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, well, some news going on with Xbox.

718
00:47:01,729 --> 00:47:06,431
[SPEAKER_09]: There is a new dashboard apparently on the way, and there's a preview that was being rolled out.

719
00:47:06,671 --> 00:47:12,813
[SPEAKER_09]: Major Nelson had put out the call on his blog that there is going to be another Xbox 360, I guess, beta test, if you will.

720
00:47:12,833 --> 00:47:13,894
[SPEAKER_09]: They call it a preview program.

721
00:47:13,934 --> 00:47:19,036
[SPEAKER_09]: It's basically a beta test where they did this a little while ago with the new Xbox experience.

722
00:47:19,076 --> 00:47:20,937
[SPEAKER_09]: I think they did it again with the new Netflix and all that.

723
00:47:21,537 --> 00:47:29,042
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I did it last time when they have that, and I didn't do it this time for a couple reasons.

724
00:47:29,562 --> 00:47:36,407
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, mainly because I hated having to update my system all the damn time, because it would be like, oh, we got another update, oh, we got another update, and you know, just...

725
00:47:36,847 --> 00:47:40,492
[SPEAKER_10]: All these updates rolling out a few times a day, and it was annoying.

726
00:47:40,792 --> 00:47:46,940
[SPEAKER_10]: And seriously, not worth my getting a copy of Halo Reach, even if it is in this new format.

727
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:48,762
[SPEAKER_10]: And I am kind of curious to see what the new format is.

728
00:47:50,224 --> 00:47:50,544
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

729
00:47:50,625 --> 00:47:51,706
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just not really worth it.

730
00:47:52,466 --> 00:47:56,548
[SPEAKER_09]: What's also interesting about this beta test program, everybody's getting a free copy of Halo Reach with it.

731
00:47:56,708 --> 00:47:59,189
[SPEAKER_09]: So there is definitely something in it for folks here.

732
00:47:59,770 --> 00:48:05,292
[SPEAKER_09]: And the reason why it's coming with Halo Reach is because there is a new disc format that's basically being beta tested with this whole thing.

733
00:48:06,052 --> 00:48:09,274
[SPEAKER_09]: And that a lot of people are kind of assuming, oh, well, this is to basically...

734
00:48:11,455 --> 00:48:13,157
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't copy that floppy in the piracy hole.

735
00:48:13,377 --> 00:48:13,917
[SPEAKER_09]: All that stuff.

736
00:48:13,957 --> 00:48:15,298
[SPEAKER_09]: This is there to update that.

737
00:48:15,678 --> 00:48:16,939
[SPEAKER_09]: And that is probably true.

738
00:48:17,099 --> 00:48:18,300
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a big part of this as well.

739
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:21,362
[SPEAKER_09]: But apparently there's something else going on.

740
00:48:21,522 --> 00:48:23,764
[SPEAKER_09]: This is from a website called Digital Foundry.

741
00:48:24,164 --> 00:48:32,570
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently saying that the new disk format that Microsoft's going to put in this new Xbox update, it's going to give an extra gigabyte of the disk back.

742
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:36,091
[SPEAKER_09]: So they're basically creating a new gig of space on the disc.

743
00:48:36,111 --> 00:48:41,153
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if that's maybe using the outside layer or maybe some type of copy partition they were using.

744
00:48:41,313 --> 00:48:45,475
[SPEAKER_10]: They had a video partition or something like that or a certain partition that was in there.

745
00:48:46,035 --> 00:48:47,596
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, it was weird.

746
00:48:47,616 --> 00:48:52,198
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it was either the security partition or the video partition.

747
00:48:52,338 --> 00:48:52,698
[SPEAKER_09]: Here it is.

748
00:48:52,818 --> 00:48:59,501
[SPEAKER_09]: There was over a gigabyte dedicated to a DVD video partition that also contained anti-piracy security sectors.

749
00:48:59,781 --> 00:49:00,401
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

750
00:49:24,566 --> 00:49:25,867
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

751
00:49:46,039 --> 00:49:46,599
[SPEAKER_10]: Who cares?

752
00:49:46,819 --> 00:49:54,863
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so I pop this in my DVD player, because I'm an idiot, and it comes up with, you know, some Xbox logo.

753
00:49:54,903 --> 00:49:57,084
[SPEAKER_10]: That doesn't say that this is... Oh, is that what happens?

754
00:49:57,604 --> 00:50:00,065
[SPEAKER_09]: I've never thought to put an Xbox 360 disc in a regular DVD player.

755
00:50:00,085 --> 00:50:00,885
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, that's what it will do.

756
00:50:01,005 --> 00:50:02,506
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's that video partition.

757
00:50:02,886 --> 00:50:05,087
[SPEAKER_10]: And so it'll go, oh, this is an Xbox disc.

758
00:50:05,107 --> 00:50:06,767
[SPEAKER_10]: You have to play it in your Xbox 360.

759
00:50:07,448 --> 00:50:10,249
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, how about you just don't do that, and then all it'll do is can't read disc.

760
00:50:10,729 --> 00:50:11,889
[SPEAKER_09]: Or just have a picture.

761
00:50:12,430 --> 00:50:13,910
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, idiot, this is for an Xbox 360.

762
00:50:13,950 --> 00:50:14,030
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye.

763
00:50:15,871 --> 00:50:17,051
[SPEAKER_10]: It could just be a static picture.

764
00:50:17,071 --> 00:50:18,011
[SPEAKER_10]: It pretty much is a picture.

765
00:50:18,052 --> 00:50:21,332
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm surprised that it takes a gigabyte of space for that.

766
00:50:21,492 --> 00:50:25,013
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it seems like an awful lot for just a little picture.

767
00:50:25,973 --> 00:50:32,735
[SPEAKER_09]: SSJ100 Matt in our chatroom at chat.orangelandradio.com is asking, So will these free copies of Halo Reach go towards its overall sales numbers?

768
00:50:33,355 --> 00:50:37,996
[SPEAKER_09]: I think maybe throwing back a little bit to when they were giving Guitar Hero Van Halen free with Guitar Hero 5.

769
00:50:38,316 --> 00:50:38,756
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember that?

770
00:50:39,316 --> 00:51:08,429
[SPEAKER_09]: yes but it doesn't really matter at this point anyways because I mean the sales of it's probably dropped quite a bit SolarFlare in our chatroom says it will still be behind Blu-ray though interesting point you know that is one thing that holds CX Plus 360 back a little bit you know and we do have a lot of companies that want to port their games to both systems so I bet there's a lot of games out there on the PS3 that aren't really realizing their full potential of Blu-ray and this will not just help the 360 games expand but I think it will help the PS3 ports expand too right?

771
00:51:10,061 --> 00:51:11,443
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, no.

772
00:51:11,703 --> 00:51:28,137
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, a little bit maybe, but I don't really think it's going to make a huge difference because if those companies are holding back their ports just because of space issues or whatever, or if they're porting it to multiple systems using the same assets, then it's not a huge deal, I don't think.

773
00:51:28,157 --> 00:51:32,061
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, if they really wanted to, they could just uncompress everything for the Blu-ray, but

774
00:51:32,901 --> 00:51:45,391
[SPEAKER_10]: With Blu-ray, the whole problem was that it's slow, especially that data on the inside is really slow compared to the stuff on the edge of the disc.

775
00:51:45,951 --> 00:51:48,293
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's just...

776
00:51:49,554 --> 00:51:49,874
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

777
00:51:50,174 --> 00:51:51,315
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think it's going to make a huge difference.

778
00:51:51,335 --> 00:51:53,736
[SPEAKER_10]: There's not a lot of games that utilize all the space on there as well.

779
00:51:54,396 --> 00:51:56,197
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me close on this question here for this story.

780
00:51:56,417 --> 00:52:01,920
[SPEAKER_09]: SolarFlare in our chatroom asks, are they trying to make time to having to break out the next-gen console?

781
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:13,685
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, we have noticed a lot of, in this generation of games, and, you know, part of it you could blame on the recession, part of it is this whole 10-year cycle or whatever they're talking about, but you have noticed that especially the 360 has had its life extended...

782
00:52:14,105 --> 00:52:15,366
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura has some more Xbox news for us.

783
00:52:43,584 --> 00:52:45,865
[SPEAKER_04]: I do if I don't drop my mic.

784
00:52:46,065 --> 00:52:51,168
[SPEAKER_04]: This actually has to do with the live indie games issue on Xbox Live about the ratings.

785
00:52:51,648 --> 00:52:55,270
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we had said that we had a feeling that the ratings were kind of fixed.

786
00:52:55,871 --> 00:52:57,471
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, that they might have been manipulated.

787
00:52:57,812 --> 00:53:04,055
[SPEAKER_04]: And it turns out that it actually might be the X and A Creators Club.

788
00:53:05,056 --> 00:53:05,456
[SPEAKER_04]: Excuse me.

789
00:53:06,136 --> 00:53:12,879
[SPEAKER_04]: actually tweeted that, and I quote, we are investigating a possible misuse of ratings on XBLIG titles.

790
00:53:13,559 --> 00:53:15,440
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll announce more information here as it develops.

791
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:23,984
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically, it's been coming to people's attention that ratings have gone from really high to just dropping drastically.

792
00:53:24,544 --> 00:53:26,825
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they're fairly certain that there's manipulation behind it.

793
00:53:27,327 --> 00:53:37,871
[SPEAKER_06]: So if the fraud is true, is it being used to bolster the ratings of games that maybe are terrible or to lower stuff that competitors don't want you to buy?

794
00:53:37,891 --> 00:53:46,375
[SPEAKER_10]: It wasn't necessarily that they were being manipulated, but it wasn't by the whim of a certain publisher.

795
00:53:46,395 --> 00:53:50,096
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically, it was that one lacrosse game that was on there.

796
00:53:50,216 --> 00:53:52,397
[SPEAKER_10]: They tweeted their fellows, hey, give us a five-star rating.

797
00:53:52,777 --> 00:53:58,479
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, the people that are fans of the game also took it upon themselves to rate the other games one star that were in the area.

798
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:05,002
[SPEAKER_10]: So they, you know, inadvertently created like, you know, ratings fixing almost.

799
00:54:05,582 --> 00:54:12,405
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's just because there's no real system in place to where you have to purchase the game in order to rate it and that kind of stuff.

800
00:54:13,045 --> 00:54:13,986
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, I guess that's true.

801
00:54:14,006 --> 00:54:15,526
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can just rate it regardless.

802
00:54:16,587 --> 00:54:21,289
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it seems to be highly unfair that someone should be able to rate something that they haven't played, so...

803
00:54:21,940 --> 00:54:29,285
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, because I thought that you, you know, spent your one to three bucks or your two to four hundred, whatever, Microsoft space bucks.

804
00:54:29,786 --> 00:54:31,046
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, wow, this is terrible.

805
00:54:31,087 --> 00:54:36,010
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you can give it two stars after you've at least played the demo or bought it.

806
00:54:36,070 --> 00:54:36,751
[SPEAKER_06]: But I guess not.

807
00:54:36,791 --> 00:54:38,332
[SPEAKER_06]: You can just do what you want.

808
00:54:38,352 --> 00:54:40,193
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they're looking into it, apparently.

809
00:54:40,293 --> 00:54:43,095
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe they'll realize that was one big oversight.

810
00:54:44,456 --> 00:54:46,678
[SPEAKER_09]: To be honest, doesn't iTunes have that same problem?

811
00:54:47,198 --> 00:54:49,860
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I could go in and rate podcasts a one that I've never listened to.

812
00:54:50,547 --> 00:54:52,531
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, not with the apps.

813
00:54:52,632 --> 00:54:56,399
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you can only rate them after you've used them.

814
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:57,281
[SPEAKER_09]: Perhaps.

815
00:54:58,023 --> 00:55:00,127
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that if you delete an app, it asks you to rate it.

816
00:55:00,147 --> 00:55:01,450
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

817
00:55:02,683 --> 00:55:05,764
[SPEAKER_09]: Which, by the way, you should leave Orange Noms Radio a five-star review on iTunes.

818
00:55:05,804 --> 00:55:06,284
[SPEAKER_04]: Do it.

819
00:55:06,444 --> 00:55:06,624
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

820
00:55:07,024 --> 00:55:10,105
[SPEAKER_09]: We actually had a couple nice ones this past week, so thank you guys for doing that.

821
00:55:10,145 --> 00:55:10,825
[SPEAKER_09]: Really appreciate it.

822
00:55:11,305 --> 00:55:17,767
[SPEAKER_09]: That kind of stuff does help because when we get more five-star reviews on iTunes, it kind of bumps you up in the listing and just helps us get more exposure.

823
00:55:18,827 --> 00:55:21,368
[SPEAKER_09]: Add more people to our chat room and make it a bigger party on Sunday nights.

824
00:55:21,388 --> 00:55:23,389
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to be as exposed as Melina's boobs.

825
00:55:24,349 --> 00:55:24,989
[SPEAKER_09]: If not more so.

826
00:55:25,289 --> 00:55:25,489
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

827
00:55:25,549 --> 00:55:25,909
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.

828
00:55:26,529 --> 00:55:26,789
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

829
00:55:26,829 --> 00:55:27,250
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving on.

830
00:55:27,310 --> 00:55:27,610
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki.

831
00:55:28,610 --> 00:55:28,750
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

832
00:55:30,134 --> 00:55:32,515
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, by the way, the people doing this, total dicks.

833
00:55:32,635 --> 00:55:33,455
[SPEAKER_09]: I forgot to say that earlier.

834
00:55:36,276 --> 00:55:38,597
[SPEAKER_10]: Another cancellation story.

835
00:55:38,737 --> 00:55:46,659
[SPEAKER_10]: This isn't a big surprise because this has been delayed forever and I remember playing it back a couple... God, how many E3s ago was that that I actually played this?

836
00:55:46,839 --> 00:55:52,021
[SPEAKER_10]: But Sony Online Entertainment has confirmed that they have cancelled the agency.

837
00:55:53,001 --> 00:55:53,901
[SPEAKER_10]: It will not be coming out.

838
00:55:57,162 --> 00:55:59,024
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, it was late forever.

839
00:55:59,044 --> 00:56:01,747
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a spy MMO.

840
00:56:02,668 --> 00:56:04,049
[SPEAKER_10]: Kind of a cool little game, but...

841
00:56:05,399 --> 00:56:05,679
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh well.

842
00:56:05,819 --> 00:56:11,184
[SPEAKER_09]: Man, I'm just keeping Sad Trombone open in a window tonight, because there's a lot of just cancellation news.

843
00:56:11,284 --> 00:56:31,461
[SPEAKER_10]: Kind of alluding to what I was talking about before when we were talking about Free Realms, they're also saying that the company is discontinuing production of the title to focus on developing resources on delivering two new MMOs based on its renowned Planetside and EverQuest properties, while also maintaining its current portfolio of online games.

844
00:56:31,921 --> 00:56:37,868
[SPEAKER_10]: So, maybe a new free-to-play EverQuest?

845
00:56:38,308 --> 00:56:42,653
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm surprised just a straight-up port of the first EverQuest game hasn't shown up on PS3 yet.

846
00:56:42,934 --> 00:56:45,677
[SPEAKER_09]: Because there's still shit-tons of people playing old-school EverQuest.

847
00:56:45,737 --> 00:56:47,419
[SPEAKER_09]: There's, what, like 20-something expansions?

848
00:56:47,799 --> 00:56:48,300
[SPEAKER_09]: It's crazy.

849
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:50,462
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, people invested a lot in that game.

850
00:56:51,343 --> 00:56:52,124
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

851
00:57:11,580 --> 00:57:22,063
[SPEAKER_06]: so you know yeah new loyalty mount for like as if you have a concurrent subscription like City of Heroes does that for how long you've been paying for the game for Ultima Online when did that come out?

852
00:57:22,924 --> 00:57:40,449
[SPEAKER_06]: I was one of the first MMOs period it was a long time ago it was probably like 99 it was a long time ago yeah it was like 12 or 13 year loyalty 1997 okay yeah so yeah so if they're still around then so is the EverQuest people yeah

853
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:44,620
[SPEAKER_09]: Boy, oh boy.

854
00:57:46,381 --> 00:57:49,884
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's when you invest so much time into something, it's hard to walk away from it.

855
00:57:50,344 --> 00:57:51,685
[SPEAKER_09]: And for me, that's a lot of wow.

856
00:57:51,725 --> 00:57:52,265
[SPEAKER_09]: It's hard for me.

857
00:57:52,565 --> 00:58:00,031
[SPEAKER_09]: I was really interested in DC Universe, but I've been having a hard time saying, I'm going to really invest this time in DC Universe because all my friends are on wow.

858
00:58:00,871 --> 00:58:01,732
[SPEAKER_09]: This is tough.

859
00:58:01,812 --> 00:58:03,634
[SPEAKER_09]: Just type a slash played and see.

860
00:58:04,634 --> 00:58:05,195
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll cry.

861
00:58:05,595 --> 00:58:05,855
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

862
00:58:06,336 --> 00:58:09,318
[SPEAKER_09]: Spassinator in our chat room says the agency being canceled.

863
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:12,141
[SPEAKER_09]: How the flying fuck can anyone not see that coming?

864
00:58:13,598 --> 00:58:14,238
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I don't know.

865
00:58:14,379 --> 00:58:16,160
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if I would say I saw it coming.

866
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:23,284
[SPEAKER_09]: I did notice it was an awfully long development cycle, but MMOs on consoles have just become so unpredictable.

867
00:58:24,165 --> 00:58:26,607
[SPEAKER_09]: And most of the news is really bad.

868
00:58:28,368 --> 00:58:30,249
[SPEAKER_09]: What are they doing wrong?

869
00:58:30,529 --> 00:58:34,152
[SPEAKER_09]: Why do consoles just seem to not be able to get MMOs?

870
00:58:34,612 --> 00:58:40,876
[SPEAKER_09]: The lone exception being probably DC Universe, maybe Final Fantasy XI, but that game is a little old now.

871
00:58:41,337 --> 00:58:42,958
[SPEAKER_09]: So what is it about

872
00:58:44,258 --> 00:58:45,139
[SPEAKER_09]: and DarkSakura.com.

873
00:59:06,467 --> 00:59:16,754
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an assembly line of just how many games you can churn through in a certain amount of time, but you buy a certain amount of games in a year and you want to get through them all, whereas an MMO is really open-ended.

874
00:59:16,794 --> 00:59:25,260
[SPEAKER_06]: You never get to the end of WoW, and that's sort of the culture or the attitude that is more appropriate for PCs, if that makes sense.

875
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:37,869
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm with you to a point, but then I ask, what about Halo, where it thrives on, it's at least, you know, the older games, especially 2, thrived on online, which didn't really have a beginning and an end.

876
00:59:37,909 --> 00:59:40,150
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe a match had a beginning and an end, I don't know.

877
00:59:40,310 --> 00:59:43,332
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yeah, those are broken up into matches, yeah.

878
00:59:43,713 --> 00:59:43,973
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

879
00:59:45,472 --> 00:59:47,735
[SPEAKER_09]: GameGuru in our chatroom flat out says because it is not WoW

880
00:59:58,809 --> 01:00:00,991
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

881
01:00:01,031 --> 01:00:04,333
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm a big supporter of WoW, although I don't always agree with everything Blizzard does.

882
01:00:04,473 --> 01:00:07,775
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think there's room for more than one.

883
01:00:08,876 --> 01:00:11,578
[SPEAKER_09]: A game like DC Universe, I don't think it's a failure.

884
01:00:11,718 --> 01:00:13,379
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know how that game has been selling.

885
01:00:13,439 --> 01:00:14,720
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's been doing okay.

886
01:00:15,380 --> 01:00:20,804
[SPEAKER_09]: But right now, okay in the console universe is better than anything else right now.

887
01:00:20,904 --> 01:00:21,504
[SPEAKER_04]: Than no-kay?

888
01:00:21,824 --> 01:00:22,505
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, than no-kay.

889
01:00:22,845 --> 01:00:24,006
[SPEAKER_06]: EVE Online is still kicking.

890
01:00:24,146 --> 01:00:27,347
[SPEAKER_06]: Doesn't have WoW's numbers, but it's definitely got its market share.

891
01:00:27,367 --> 01:00:28,728
[SPEAKER_04]: There's people still doing Perfect World.

892
01:00:29,008 --> 01:00:30,608
[SPEAKER_09]: Final Fantasy XI still has supporters.

893
01:00:30,908 --> 01:00:31,869
[SPEAKER_09]: Guild Wars.

894
01:00:31,889 --> 01:00:32,549
[SPEAKER_09]: Shit.

895
01:00:33,329 --> 01:00:37,231
[SPEAKER_09]: Ultima Online and EverQuest still have lots of people to play.

896
01:00:37,531 --> 01:00:40,092
[SPEAKER_09]: Lineage 2, still a fucking huge game.

897
01:00:40,172 --> 01:00:41,453
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really big in Korea.

898
01:00:41,473 --> 01:00:42,513
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, just not here in the US.

899
01:00:43,634 --> 01:00:45,154
[SPEAKER_09]: So, let's see.

900
01:00:45,174 --> 01:00:46,215
[SPEAKER_09]: Going to our chat room again.

901
01:00:47,135 --> 01:00:50,297
[SPEAKER_09]: Brad from PodCulture says, wouldn't Phantasy Star Online count?

902
01:00:50,617 --> 01:00:51,057
[SPEAKER_09]: Kind of.

903
01:00:52,086 --> 01:00:57,851
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I thought it was cool that Sega actually let people transfer their characters to private servers.

904
01:00:58,892 --> 01:00:59,472
[SPEAKER_04]: That was cool.

905
01:01:00,513 --> 01:01:05,117
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it was like, well, we have to close it, but I know there's still people doing it.

906
01:01:05,137 --> 01:01:06,318
[SPEAKER_04]: And there was Phantasy Star Universe.

907
01:01:07,819 --> 01:01:09,160
[SPEAKER_04]: Fancy Star Online Fancy Star Online

908
01:01:36,727 --> 01:01:37,708
[SPEAKER_04]: PSO Diablo Dungeon Crawling

909
01:01:52,186 --> 01:01:55,568
[SPEAKER_04]: I really started liking PSO when I started playing online.

910
01:01:57,069 --> 01:01:58,150
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, on the computer.

911
01:01:58,570 --> 01:02:00,971
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I think really hurt PSO?

912
01:02:01,151 --> 01:02:04,313
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what really, really hurt that franchise more than anything, I think?

913
01:02:04,353 --> 01:02:04,853
[SPEAKER_09]: PSU?

914
01:02:05,534 --> 01:02:06,954
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I would say it was before that.

915
01:02:07,014 --> 01:02:08,515
[SPEAKER_09]: I would say it was the GameCube game.

916
01:02:09,596 --> 01:02:14,639
[SPEAKER_09]: Because Nintendo just aborted online support.

917
01:02:15,439 --> 01:02:24,746
[SPEAKER_09]: literally told Sega, sure, we'll help you out with this, you know, MMO thing and put out this broadband adapter or anything and then Nintendo just basically said, ah, fuck it.

918
01:02:25,026 --> 01:02:25,747
[SPEAKER_06]: LOL, JK.

919
01:02:26,167 --> 01:02:28,108
[SPEAKER_04]: No, here's what I think was even worse.

920
01:02:28,609 --> 01:02:31,451
[SPEAKER_04]: The Dreamcast version in the US, no online play.

921
01:02:32,251 --> 01:02:38,956
[SPEAKER_04]: You had to do this little thing to manipulate it to get it to play online because it wouldn't support the broadband adapter.

922
01:02:39,136 --> 01:02:44,342
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I imported that or I did something where... Yeah, I could play the Dreamcast one online.

923
01:02:44,362 --> 01:02:45,163
[SPEAKER_06]: I had the Ethernet.

924
01:02:45,223 --> 01:02:46,385
[SPEAKER_09]: I had the modem though.

925
01:02:46,945 --> 01:02:48,287
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, no, we had that too.

926
01:02:48,467 --> 01:02:51,671
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like it was something that you had to manipulate in the menu.

927
01:02:52,051 --> 01:02:57,678
[SPEAKER_06]: The DNS, I think, or your IP, you had to put in something to force it to go out through the Ethernet.

928
01:02:57,998 --> 01:03:00,239
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you had to do something to it to get it to work.

929
01:03:00,419 --> 01:03:01,759
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't remember having that problem.

930
01:03:01,779 --> 01:03:02,740
[SPEAKER_09]: I just remember it working.

931
01:03:03,540 --> 01:03:04,060
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, whatever.

932
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:04,920
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been so long.

933
01:03:05,641 --> 01:03:17,265
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I guess, and also going back to the agency, thematically, a spy MMO, I don't know, something about MMOs is you have to, even in Phantasy Star Online, you're not killing literal dragons, but it's whimsical fantasy sci-fi.

934
01:03:18,005 --> 01:03:21,287
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, no one wants to get together with their five friends and smuggle microfiche.

935
01:03:21,307 --> 01:03:22,508
[SPEAKER_04]: Matrix Online ended.

936
01:03:23,068 --> 01:03:26,911
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything that I've noticed... Well, City of Heroes is still going... Star Trek Online is still going strong.

937
01:03:27,671 --> 01:03:28,752
[SPEAKER_04]: I love Star Trek Online.

938
01:03:28,972 --> 01:03:30,733
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, I need to pay for a month, but...

939
01:03:31,653 --> 01:03:35,577
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think an MMO has to be swords and dragons and mystical stuff.

940
01:03:35,617 --> 01:03:37,659
[SPEAKER_09]: It has to be fantasy.

941
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:40,302
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a tried and true method.

942
01:03:40,703 --> 01:03:42,325
[SPEAKER_09]: That's an established formula.

943
01:03:42,365 --> 01:03:44,247
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a formula that's working right now.

944
01:03:44,767 --> 01:03:46,249
[SPEAKER_09]: That's WoW's formula, in a way.

945
01:03:47,611 --> 01:03:49,012
[SPEAKER_09]: But now they have goblins with motorcycles.

946
01:03:49,893 --> 01:03:51,916
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we haven't really seen the other type.

947
01:03:51,956 --> 01:03:54,519
[SPEAKER_09]: But then again, EVE Online is a space game.

948
01:03:55,059 --> 01:03:57,382
[SPEAKER_09]: DC Universe, not really dragons.

949
01:03:58,103 --> 01:04:00,346
[SPEAKER_09]: Star Trek Online, totally different thing.

950
01:04:00,386 --> 01:04:03,910
[SPEAKER_09]: But Star Trek's a whole separate fandom too, you know?

951
01:04:04,110 --> 01:04:04,311
[SPEAKER_09]: Like...

952
01:04:04,605 --> 01:04:05,285
[SPEAKER_04]: Star Trek Online

953
01:04:28,976 --> 01:04:30,737
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's move on from MMO Chat.

954
01:04:30,817 --> 01:04:32,778
[SPEAKER_09]: We're running a little long because of MMO Chat.

955
01:04:33,098 --> 01:04:34,399
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's do some other quick stories here.

956
01:04:34,699 --> 01:04:40,282
[SPEAKER_09]: I got a story about GameStop, and GameStop apparently has bought, absorbed some more companies.

957
01:04:40,442 --> 01:04:45,305
[SPEAKER_09]: They bought Spawn Labs, and they've also bought a company called Impulse.

958
01:04:45,405 --> 01:04:46,866
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, what the hell did these things do?

959
01:04:47,246 --> 01:04:55,771
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, Spawn Labs, they did this high-def box set that apparently was... I guess it sounds to me a lot like the whole...

960
01:04:57,572 --> 01:04:58,612
[SPEAKER_09]: OnLive system.

961
01:04:58,673 --> 01:04:59,693
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of similar to that.

962
01:04:59,753 --> 01:05:01,614
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's one thing they've absorbed.

963
01:05:01,995 --> 01:05:20,007
[SPEAKER_09]: And then they also got Impulse, which apparently is going to have three parts to it, which is the client, the Impulse client, which you can use to download games, the Reactor, which is like DRM management and copy protection and all of that, letting the developers do achievement, friends lists, and all the kind of like Steam, Xbox Live stuff.

964
01:05:20,047 --> 01:05:20,967
[SPEAKER_09]: Sounds like a Steam clone.

965
01:05:21,708 --> 01:05:25,931
[SPEAKER_09]: And then Impulse Publisher, which is real-time reporting and management tools.

966
01:05:26,731 --> 01:05:51,700
[SPEAKER_09]: GameStop has bought these companies so in a way I sort of see this as them thinking ahead a little bit because these companies have more to do with online distribution and something that isn't so much the stores you know they did not buy stores in this acquisition well they did but it's a different type you know so I have a feeling they are thinking ahead as to this whole how do we counter digital distribution they're absorbing more and more into their collective

967
01:05:52,454 --> 01:05:53,214
[SPEAKER_09]: A little bit, yes.

968
01:05:53,575 --> 01:05:57,976
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, that doesn't mean all the mall stores are going to shut down next week.

969
01:05:58,096 --> 01:06:03,858
[SPEAKER_09]: But, I don't know, this digital distribution thing, if I was kind of in this GameStop industry, I'd be a little freaked out right now.

970
01:06:04,838 --> 01:06:08,700
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, maybe not right this second, but, you know, five years from now, this could be...

971
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:10,241
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

972
01:06:25,692 --> 01:06:41,106
[SPEAKER_09]: so I feel like GameStop you know and again I don't mean to like panic people or whatever this is years away you know these things happening but but GameStop buying this I think they're trying to kind of put themselves in a position where they are like like Blockbuster got in on it early that's what this seems like to me they're setting up a safety net yeah

973
01:06:44,009 --> 01:06:48,553
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have any details because I really don't think I know any more store managers.

974
01:06:49,514 --> 01:06:54,318
[SPEAKER_04]: But from what I've noticed, I'll go into a GameStop and it'll be dead empty.

975
01:06:54,958 --> 01:06:55,659
[SPEAKER_04]: There'll be no one in there.

976
01:06:56,620 --> 01:06:59,382
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that it's just, first of all, a sign of the economy.

977
01:06:59,442 --> 01:06:59,983
[SPEAKER_04]: And another thing...

978
01:07:00,763 --> 01:07:15,149
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is actually, I'm not going to go into it because it's a little bit more on the psychology level, but I think that people are becoming more isolated, wanting to do more things from home, not wanting to go out amongst people.

979
01:07:15,790 --> 01:07:17,430
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?

980
01:07:17,930 --> 01:07:21,332
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why online services have become so popular.

981
01:07:22,292 --> 01:07:23,753
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, people need to get out of the house.

982
01:07:24,013 --> 01:07:25,894
[SPEAKER_09]: See, I've played devil's advocate here, though, a little bit.

983
01:07:25,954 --> 01:07:28,495
[SPEAKER_09]: The one by his house in South San Francisco, always packed.

984
01:07:29,266 --> 01:07:30,327
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

985
01:07:50,486 --> 01:07:55,750
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see, go into our chatroom at chat.orange.radio.com SolarFlare says they're going to have to do some good stuff to compete with Steam.

986
01:07:56,551 --> 01:08:01,115
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's what part of all this is, is to really align themselves in a way where they can.

987
01:08:01,455 --> 01:08:11,304
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe they'll start doing this thing in the store where, you know, buy the copy in the store and get some type of digital download thing, the free costume or something extra.

988
01:08:11,364 --> 01:08:12,986
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe that's kind of where they're going.

989
01:08:13,346 --> 01:08:13,726
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

990
01:08:14,727 --> 01:08:15,448
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, moving on.

991
01:08:15,508 --> 01:08:16,609
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, what do you got for us?

992
01:08:17,888 --> 01:08:23,471
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we have some news out of Japan, which is where the video games come from.

993
01:08:23,991 --> 01:08:25,432
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a new Super Mario Bros.

994
01:08:26,232 --> 01:08:30,634
[SPEAKER_04]: Wii arcade cabinet that's being developed by Capcom.

995
01:08:32,338 --> 01:08:35,159
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's Super Mario Bros.

996
01:08:35,239 --> 01:08:36,340
[SPEAKER_04]: Wii Coin World.

997
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:40,321
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a four-player game where you earn medals by participating in many games.

998
01:08:40,381 --> 01:08:43,762
[SPEAKER_04]: So kind of Mario Party-ish.

999
01:08:44,382 --> 01:08:44,963
[SPEAKER_04]: I say ish.

1000
01:08:47,184 --> 01:08:48,184
[SPEAKER_04]: Not too much running and jumping.

1001
01:08:48,984 --> 01:08:53,366
[SPEAKER_04]: And it actually is on Capcom of Japan's website.

1002
01:08:53,426 --> 01:08:54,926
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a trailer and everything.

1003
01:08:56,087 --> 01:08:56,247
[SPEAKER_04]: And...

1004
01:08:57,688 --> 01:08:58,989
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just like, why is Capcom doing it?

1005
01:08:59,009 --> 01:09:05,694
[SPEAKER_04]: But then again, Capcom is... Nintendo hasn't ever really been much in the arcade scene except for the play choice.

1006
01:09:06,314 --> 01:09:07,435
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that was years ago, though.

1007
01:09:07,595 --> 01:09:09,536
[SPEAKER_09]: Arcades are not even the same thing now.

1008
01:09:09,937 --> 01:09:14,560
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, I more think this is newsworthy as, oh, arcade games are still popular somewhere in the world.

1009
01:09:15,661 --> 01:09:21,245
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's actually neat that they've got that relationship with Capcom to do it, because Capcom does put out good quality games.

1010
01:09:21,900 --> 01:09:29,007
[SPEAKER_06]: Who did the Mario Kart sit-down driver game that said... Namco, because you can play as Pac-Man and Ms.

1011
01:09:29,027 --> 01:09:29,568
[SPEAKER_09]: Pac-Man in that.

1012
01:09:29,888 --> 01:09:30,148
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1013
01:09:30,389 --> 01:09:30,889
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I thought.

1014
01:09:31,069 --> 01:09:32,311
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah, Namco did that.

1015
01:09:32,771 --> 01:09:34,273
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah, it's not totally unheard of.

1016
01:09:34,533 --> 01:09:36,054
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a good example.

1017
01:09:36,094 --> 01:09:39,478
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not totally unheard of that other companies might get to do Nintendo stuff in the arcade.

1018
01:09:40,698 --> 01:09:47,662
[SPEAKER_09]: One of my favorite and most underrated arcade machines ever, F-Zero, which is a fucking amazing game.

1019
01:09:47,962 --> 01:09:52,524
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, the arcade machine's biggest problem was it only had six freaking tracks in it.

1020
01:09:52,624 --> 01:09:53,845
[SPEAKER_10]: You could unlock them all at home.

1021
01:09:54,225 --> 01:09:58,187
[SPEAKER_10]: There's one of the guys that's in the PlayStation hacking scene or whatever.

1022
01:09:58,707 --> 01:09:59,268
[SPEAKER_10]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1023
01:10:19,229 --> 01:10:20,250
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks really cool.

1024
01:10:20,610 --> 01:10:23,271
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll link the website to everyone in the chat room.

1025
01:10:23,351 --> 01:10:25,893
[SPEAKER_09]: You know how that would make millions here in the U.S.?

1026
01:10:26,973 --> 01:10:27,354
[SPEAKER_09]: Tickets.

1027
01:10:28,874 --> 01:10:32,356
[SPEAKER_10]: I wonder if this will be part of New Super Mario Bros.

1028
01:10:32,396 --> 01:10:34,177
[SPEAKER_10]: Wii DOS.

1029
01:10:35,318 --> 01:10:35,598
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe.

1030
01:10:36,518 --> 01:10:37,019
[SPEAKER_09]: You never know.

1031
01:10:38,499 --> 01:10:39,660
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's move on.

1032
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:40,380
[SPEAKER_09]: Travel the world.

1033
01:10:40,420 --> 01:10:45,403
[SPEAKER_09]: Look at some release dates of actual stuff coming to a store near you.

1034
01:10:45,917 --> 01:10:53,641
[SPEAKER_10]: We're in April now, so now that we've passed the fiscal end of years for a lot of companies, there's not a lot of companies putting out stuff.

1035
01:10:53,801 --> 01:10:55,102
[SPEAKER_10]: So here's what we've got.

1036
01:10:55,262 --> 01:10:58,684
[SPEAKER_10]: Carnival Games, Monkey See, Monkey Do for the Xbox 360 and Kinect.

1037
01:10:59,164 --> 01:11:00,845
[SPEAKER_10]: That's coming out this week.

1038
01:11:01,365 --> 01:11:04,247
[SPEAKER_10]: Karaoke Revolution Glee Volume 2.

1039
01:11:05,368 --> 01:11:05,768
[SPEAKER_10]: Coming out...

1040
01:11:06,648 --> 01:11:08,149
[SPEAKER_10]: Game Only and with a mic.

1041
01:11:08,689 --> 01:11:10,390
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, I just burped.

1042
01:11:12,172 --> 01:11:16,354
[SPEAKER_10]: Remington Super Slam Hunting Alaska on the Wii.

1043
01:11:16,394 --> 01:11:17,715
[SPEAKER_10]: Starring Sarah Palin.

1044
01:11:18,175 --> 01:11:18,715
[SPEAKER_10]: Except not really.

1045
01:11:21,317 --> 01:11:27,161
[SPEAKER_10]: And then on the 3DS a week from today, Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell 3D.

1046
01:11:28,461 --> 01:11:33,484
[SPEAKER_10]: And I believe Raven Rabbit's Travel Through Time 3D is also coming out at that same time.

1047
01:11:35,566 --> 01:11:35,966
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it.

1048
01:11:37,338 --> 01:11:37,638
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

1049
01:11:37,879 --> 01:11:39,040
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1050
01:11:39,380 --> 01:11:39,800
[SPEAKER_10]: Short week.

1051
01:11:40,541 --> 01:11:41,281
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

1052
01:11:41,642 --> 01:11:43,283
[SPEAKER_10]: As will be much of April.

1053
01:11:43,684 --> 01:11:45,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, SSA 100 Matt says needs more bacon.

1054
01:11:47,066 --> 01:11:49,248
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's go to Japan real quick and look at the games coming out there.

1055
01:11:49,288 --> 01:11:55,213
[SPEAKER_09]: We have Bullet Soul comes out in Japan this week on the Xbox 360 and Dragon Age Origins Awakening.

1056
01:11:55,834 --> 01:12:02,039
[SPEAKER_09]: I imagine, you know, if it seems like they're behind a little bit, keep in mind they've got to translate that stuff into Japanese, so it is a little bit behind.

1057
01:12:02,460 --> 01:12:04,782
[SPEAKER_09]: On the PlayStation 3 this week, Nada.

1058
01:12:05,682 --> 01:12:09,365
[SPEAKER_09]: Going over to some other systems then, taking a look at the Wii.

1059
01:12:09,905 --> 01:12:10,945
[SPEAKER_09]: Nothing there either.

1060
01:12:10,986 --> 01:12:12,827
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, not a lot on the horizon for the Wii.

1061
01:12:13,107 --> 01:12:14,468
[SPEAKER_09]: How about the 3DS in Japan?

1062
01:12:14,508 --> 01:12:18,230
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you got a game called Cubic Ninja comes out this week in Japan.

1063
01:12:18,350 --> 01:12:27,375
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks like you move little boxes that have ninja-looking graphics on them, and you, I don't know, move them around these stages and make them fall down holes.

1064
01:12:27,756 --> 01:12:28,656
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks like a puzzle game.

1065
01:12:29,297 --> 01:12:30,077
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a puzzle game.

1066
01:12:30,357 --> 01:12:34,500
[SPEAKER_10]: It uses the tilt controls on the 3DS, and it is a 3DS game without 3D.

1067
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:36,061
[SPEAKER_10]: Earth Defense Force 2 Portable

1068
01:12:54,517 --> 01:12:57,078
[SPEAKER_09]: Princess Frontier Portable Awesome!

1069
01:12:57,639 --> 01:12:59,700
[SPEAKER_09]: And then a game called Are You Alice?

1070
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:01,180
[SPEAKER_09]: comes out this week on the PSP.

1071
01:13:01,201 --> 01:13:02,121
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello, are you Alice?

1072
01:13:02,901 --> 01:13:03,242
[SPEAKER_09]: No?

1073
01:13:03,362 --> 01:13:03,802
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1074
01:13:04,022 --> 01:13:04,622
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you Alice?

1075
01:13:04,882 --> 01:13:05,203
[SPEAKER_09]: No?

1076
01:13:06,043 --> 01:13:06,643
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you Alice?

1077
01:13:06,863 --> 01:13:08,424
[SPEAKER_09]: Regular and limited edition.

1078
01:13:08,464 --> 01:13:11,146
[SPEAKER_09]: This looks to be, it's kind of like based off an anime it looks like.

1079
01:13:12,046 --> 01:13:13,367
[SPEAKER_09]: Kind of like these chapters.

1080
01:13:13,407 --> 01:13:16,768
[SPEAKER_09]: Looks like kind of like one of those interactive novel type things.

1081
01:13:16,869 --> 01:13:18,189
[SPEAKER_09]: Because there's regular and limited edition.

1082
01:13:18,249 --> 01:13:19,230
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a dating sim!

1083
01:13:19,730 --> 01:13:20,290
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it really?

1084
01:13:20,550 --> 01:13:21,231
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it is.

1085
01:13:21,671 --> 01:13:22,291
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

1086
01:13:22,531 --> 01:13:23,412
[SPEAKER_09]: This looks too like

1087
01:13:25,325 --> 01:13:29,287
[SPEAKER_09]: If this is a dating sim, no, the woman would not have a sword in a dating sim.

1088
01:13:29,387 --> 01:13:32,669
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't... It's got all that text.

1089
01:13:32,990 --> 01:13:33,690
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh boy, alright.

1090
01:13:33,810 --> 01:13:39,493
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's some pretty fun, funny hentai ones out there that involve swords and dragons and tentacles.

1091
01:13:40,274 --> 01:13:43,976
[SPEAKER_10]: Coming next year from Quadratic Dream, Are You Jason?

1092
01:13:44,837 --> 01:13:46,237
[SPEAKER_10]: The side story for Heavy Rain.

1093
01:13:46,738 --> 01:13:47,298
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you Jason?

1094
01:13:47,758 --> 01:13:47,938
[SPEAKER_10]: No?

1095
01:13:48,279 --> 01:13:48,519
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1096
01:13:49,059 --> 01:13:49,519
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you Jason?

1097
01:13:50,100 --> 01:13:50,740
[SPEAKER_10]: Have you seen Jason?

1098
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:51,741
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you know Jason?

1099
01:13:52,121 --> 01:13:53,762
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it for Japanese release dates.

1100
01:13:54,915 --> 01:13:58,956
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, in the UK, Jack and Squat, really.

1101
01:13:59,216 --> 01:14:02,457
[SPEAKER_04]: On the 5th is Red Faction Battlegrounds for Xbox 360.

1102
01:14:03,378 --> 01:14:06,298
[SPEAKER_04]: And the same thing a day later on the 6th for PlayStation 3.

1103
01:14:06,678 --> 01:14:11,620
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, The Dishwasher Vampire Smile on Xbox 360.

1104
01:14:12,060 --> 01:14:13,080
[SPEAKER_04]: What the crap is that?

1105
01:14:13,541 --> 01:14:19,802
[SPEAKER_09]: Sounds like the sequel to The Dishwasher, the indie game that ended up being a real arcade release.

1106
01:14:20,202 --> 01:14:21,143
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah.

1107
01:14:21,223 --> 01:14:21,803
[SPEAKER_09]: Sounds like a sequel.

1108
01:14:23,522 --> 01:14:27,968
[SPEAKER_04]: There's people in cages and a dude with a big sword.

1109
01:14:28,568 --> 01:14:29,810
[SPEAKER_10]: That is a sequel to the game.

1110
01:14:30,010 --> 01:14:30,611
[SPEAKER_04]: I would play that.

1111
01:14:31,892 --> 01:14:32,193
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

1112
01:14:32,633 --> 01:14:36,358
[SPEAKER_09]: Just a couple more stories for you guys in the classic game of the week.

1113
01:14:36,438 --> 01:14:39,181
[SPEAKER_09]: And we have a pretty big one this week.

1114
01:14:39,261 --> 01:14:40,343
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll get to that in just a moment.

1115
01:14:40,383 --> 01:14:41,364
[SPEAKER_09]: But first, Loki.

1116
01:14:41,701 --> 01:14:42,922
[SPEAKER_10]: Katamari Amore and Katamari Amore Rolling Whopper

1117
01:15:00,387 --> 01:15:00,947
[SPEAKER_10]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1118
01:15:17,621 --> 01:15:22,625
[SPEAKER_10]: Perhaps, but I guess Trip was one of the characters in Enslaved.

1119
01:15:23,285 --> 01:15:25,107
[SPEAKER_10]: So maybe it's something to do with that.

1120
01:15:25,167 --> 01:15:27,889
[SPEAKER_10]: Or maybe, heaven forbid, a new IP altogether.

1121
01:15:27,909 --> 01:15:28,929
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I don't know.

1122
01:15:29,650 --> 01:15:29,970
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe.

1123
01:15:30,471 --> 01:15:31,731
[SPEAKER_10]: Or it's another Katamari game.

1124
01:15:31,792 --> 01:15:32,112
[SPEAKER_10]: Who knows?

1125
01:15:33,368 --> 01:15:41,793
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, he left to make... Yeah, he made a pretty... The subtext was pretty clear that he was sick of the franchise after the second one and he just didn't care anymore.

1126
01:15:41,813 --> 01:15:43,273
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and they kept making them anyways.

1127
01:15:43,414 --> 01:15:45,054
[SPEAKER_06]: Or I should say they kept rehashing them.

1128
01:15:45,955 --> 01:15:47,816
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm still playing Nobi Nobi Boy.

1129
01:15:48,076 --> 01:15:50,097
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, because that's what he did after Katamari.

1130
01:15:50,797 --> 01:15:51,358
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually fun.

1131
01:15:51,398 --> 01:15:53,078
[SPEAKER_04]: People are still doing stuff on Nobi Nobi Boy.

1132
01:15:53,779 --> 01:15:53,979
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1133
01:15:54,119 --> 01:15:57,281
[SPEAKER_04]: On the phone and uploading everything to Facebook so that girl will grow.

1134
01:15:57,741 --> 01:15:57,861
[SPEAKER_01]: Hmm.

1135
01:16:00,670 --> 01:16:22,066
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope if it's a new Katamari game it is like not part of this whole jump the shark that's kind of dominated this last generation of the games I'm sure we'll have a Katamari game that'll be in 3D that'll be basically the rehash levels again and it's gonna be on the 3DS I'm sure that's gonna happen eventually if it's in 3D I'll throw up because that's what they do whatever

1136
01:16:22,606 --> 01:16:23,007
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1137
01:16:23,047 --> 01:16:27,691
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't really get excited about this stuff because even I bought the last Konamaru game that was on 360.

1138
01:16:27,951 --> 01:16:30,554
[SPEAKER_10]: It was just kind of... The 360 one was bad.

1139
01:16:30,894 --> 01:16:32,035
[SPEAKER_09]: The PS3 one's alright.

1140
01:16:32,335 --> 01:16:37,820
[SPEAKER_09]: The PS3 one's okay, but the problem with the PS3 one is that it's basically the same stuff from the first two games mixed together.

1141
01:16:38,241 --> 01:16:38,741
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of like...

1142
01:16:39,642 --> 01:16:43,483
[SPEAKER_09]: The Katamari game on the PS3 is like the Wilson Phillips Greatest Hits album.

1143
01:16:43,943 --> 01:16:45,964
[SPEAKER_09]: They only fucking had two CDs, right?

1144
01:16:47,164 --> 01:16:49,825
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's not a lot to compile a Greatest Hits album from.

1145
01:16:49,865 --> 01:16:53,346
[SPEAKER_04]: Daft Punk has a Greatest Hits, and I think they only had, what, three albums?

1146
01:16:54,147 --> 01:16:54,367
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1147
01:16:55,387 --> 01:16:56,527
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, maybe that's not.

1148
01:16:56,547 --> 01:16:57,928
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess it's kind of like that, then.

1149
01:16:58,048 --> 01:16:58,408
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1150
01:17:00,469 --> 01:17:04,170
[SPEAKER_09]: Surely you've seen those one-hit wonders that have these Greatest Hits CDs.

1151
01:17:04,590 --> 01:17:08,091
[SPEAKER_04]: When I'm discovered and released an album, I'm just going to call it Greatest Hits.

1152
01:17:08,803 --> 01:17:09,203
[SPEAKER_09]: Greatest Tits

1153
01:17:24,698 --> 01:17:27,680
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, moving on, one more story from me for this part of the show.

1154
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:29,421
[SPEAKER_09]: PlayStation Rewards.

1155
01:17:29,721 --> 01:17:30,222
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember this?

1156
01:17:30,582 --> 01:17:41,208
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a beta program that happened last year, and the beta is now ending, and this PlayStation Rewards program was supposed to be launching for all the PlayStation folks in the next month.

1157
01:17:42,129 --> 01:17:48,513
[SPEAKER_09]: But I guess Sony has decided, based on what they've learned throughout the beta test, they do not want to roll this program out to the public yet.

1158
01:17:49,033 --> 01:17:55,776
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, they're going to say, well, we thank loyal and devoted customers with innovative offerings, but yeah, it's not happening right now.

1159
01:17:56,096 --> 01:17:59,998
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, they're thinking it's been delayed indefinitely.

1160
01:18:00,718 --> 01:18:06,601
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, the PlayStation Rewards program was supposed to have these quests and other things that go with it.

1161
01:18:06,821 --> 01:18:07,742
[SPEAKER_09]: It was supposed to be quests.

1162
01:18:08,242 --> 01:18:10,203
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you get real tangible stuff from this, I think?

1163
01:18:10,643 --> 01:18:11,644
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1164
01:18:32,182 --> 01:18:38,883
[SPEAKER_09]: After careful consideration and evaluation following the PlayStation Rewards beta, we have decided not to roll out the program to the public at this time.

1165
01:18:39,264 --> 01:18:49,226
[SPEAKER_09]: We remain committed to providing the best overall consumer experience for our users, and we will be refocusing our efforts in the near future to further developing PlayStation Plus and our other network services.

1166
01:18:49,606 --> 01:18:53,687
[SPEAKER_09]: So maybe becoming a PlayStation Plus member is all the reward they want to give you.

1167
01:18:54,467 --> 01:18:55,707
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what it sounds like anyway.

1168
01:18:56,387 --> 01:18:58,408
[SPEAKER_09]: So, if you want rewards, you gotta pay for them.

1169
01:18:59,028 --> 01:18:59,608
[SPEAKER_09]: They're like, wait...

1170
01:19:00,268 --> 01:19:00,888
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

1171
01:19:28,430 --> 01:19:29,791
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?

1172
01:19:29,871 --> 01:19:30,952
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's see what I can do here.

1173
01:19:31,212 --> 01:19:33,914
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I have to fast forward a wee bit in this video to get to the dialogue.

1174
01:19:57,307 --> 01:20:01,268
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

1175
01:20:06,210 --> 01:20:08,810
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow, what a mansion.

1176
01:20:09,090 --> 01:20:13,652
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope this is not Chris's blood.

1177
01:20:13,852 --> 01:20:18,173
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, it's Resident Evil.

1178
01:20:18,813 --> 01:20:23,034
[SPEAKER_04]: And I actually did put up a sample of the redone dialogue in the GameCube version.

1179
01:20:23,774 --> 01:20:24,815
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so much better.

1180
01:20:25,295 --> 01:20:25,895
[SPEAKER_04]: So much better.

1181
01:20:27,276 --> 01:20:28,837
[SPEAKER_09]: I can probably get to a little bit of that here.

1182
01:20:29,737 --> 01:20:30,918
[SPEAKER_00]: What is this place?

1183
01:20:33,319 --> 01:20:35,780
[SPEAKER_00]: Not quite your ordinary house, that's for sure.

1184
01:20:37,581 --> 01:20:39,182
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Whisker, where's Chris?

1185
01:20:40,263 --> 01:20:41,563
[SPEAKER_06]: I bought the GameCube... Jill, no!

1186
01:20:42,564 --> 01:20:43,845
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't want to go back out there.

1187
01:20:45,746 --> 01:20:48,207
[SPEAKER_04]: But we've got to find... What was that?

1188
01:20:50,008 --> 01:20:50,368
[SPEAKER_06]: Chris?

1189
01:20:51,068 --> 01:20:54,410
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway... I hope this is not Chris's blood.

1190
01:20:55,310 --> 01:20:56,131
[SPEAKER_06]: Master of Unlocking.

1191
01:20:57,003 --> 01:20:59,565
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe you, the master of unlocking, can use this.

1192
01:21:01,287 --> 01:21:07,932
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was known as Biohazard in Japan, which actually, I've got a PlayStation version of Biohazard and have it on Saturn.

1193
01:21:09,313 --> 01:21:16,539
[SPEAKER_04]: But this one is put out by Capcom, and it spawned a legacy still going on today.

1194
01:21:17,360 --> 01:21:21,924
[SPEAKER_04]: It was developed by Shinji Mikami, and as of May 2009, it sold 40 million copies.

1195
01:21:24,486 --> 01:21:28,752
[SPEAKER_04]: So this was one of the early ones into the survival horror series.

1196
01:21:33,057 --> 01:21:34,759
[SPEAKER_04]: It had a full motion intro.

1197
01:21:36,347 --> 01:21:37,027
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

1198
01:21:56,342 --> 01:22:03,451
[SPEAKER_04]: So with this one, basically you are STARS member Jill Valentine or Chris Redfield.

1199
01:22:04,433 --> 01:22:07,217
[SPEAKER_04]: And you are exploring this mansion and unlocking its secrets.

1200
01:22:08,138 --> 01:22:09,440
[SPEAKER_04]: And Chris is helped by Claire.

1201
01:22:10,201 --> 01:22:10,641
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it Claire?

1202
01:22:10,661 --> 01:22:11,182
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was Claire.

1203
01:22:12,043 --> 01:22:15,085
[SPEAKER_04]: and she was young and perky and emetic.

1204
01:22:15,145 --> 01:22:15,986
[SPEAKER_04]: Rebecca, that was it.

1205
01:22:16,026 --> 01:22:16,886
[SPEAKER_01]: Claire was his sister.

1206
01:22:17,947 --> 01:22:18,487
[SPEAKER_01]: It was Rebecca.

1207
01:22:20,448 --> 01:22:23,270
[SPEAKER_04]: And Barry helps Jill.

1208
01:22:24,351 --> 01:22:25,772
[SPEAKER_04]: He also has the best line in the game.

1209
01:22:26,652 --> 01:22:28,253
[SPEAKER_04]: You are almost a Jill sandwich.

1210
01:22:29,514 --> 01:22:31,835
[SPEAKER_03]: And I hope this is not Chris's blood.

1211
01:22:32,536 --> 01:22:34,757
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah.

1212
01:22:35,277 --> 01:22:38,579
[SPEAKER_04]: It was really, really ahead of its time when it came out.

1213
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:43,541
[SPEAKER_04]: and, um, there's actually, uh, other, uh, versions out.

1214
01:22:43,601 --> 01:22:55,685
[SPEAKER_04]: They did the, um, I think it was called, uh, I'm trying to find the name of it because they did, um, a redone version of it that was, uh,

1215
01:22:58,908 --> 01:23:00,109
[SPEAKER_04]: GameCube Better Dialogue

1216
01:23:16,901 --> 01:23:42,889
[SPEAKER_04]: and uh but it was it's pretty much the original game just really really some of the story elements they added a little bit more references to the sequel and Code Veronica I think they fixed some of the continuity issues yeah but otherwise it was the same same game well and but even in like the very first one they had a reference to Ada who was in Resident Evil 2 and she was really cool

1217
01:23:44,252 --> 01:23:48,436
[SPEAKER_04]: And it also has my favorite thing in here, is the diary.

1218
01:23:49,256 --> 01:23:50,538
[SPEAKER_04]: Ugly face so ate him.

1219
01:23:51,538 --> 01:23:51,839
[SPEAKER_04]: Itchy.

1220
01:23:52,479 --> 01:23:52,960
[SPEAKER_04]: Tasty.

1221
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:55,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so that's where itchy tasty comes from.

1222
01:23:57,484 --> 01:24:00,927
[SPEAKER_04]: So, this one, I mean, it spawned all kinds of sequels.

1223
01:24:01,087 --> 01:24:05,551
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we had Code Veronica, we had Resident Evil 2 and 3 and 4 and 5.

1224
01:24:06,712 --> 01:24:09,094
[SPEAKER_04]: Who remembers Dino Crisis?

1225
01:24:11,511 --> 01:24:13,533
[SPEAKER_04]: DinoCrisis is actually pretty neat.

1226
01:24:13,913 --> 01:24:20,339
[SPEAKER_04]: It actually just announced Resident Evil Revelations for the 3DS.

1227
01:24:21,761 --> 01:24:25,084
[SPEAKER_04]: They've had Resident Evil Portable.

1228
01:24:25,124 --> 01:24:26,265
[SPEAKER_04]: There's all kinds of versions out.

1229
01:24:26,285 --> 01:24:27,286
[SPEAKER_04]: There's mobile games.

1230
01:24:27,887 --> 01:24:30,349
[SPEAKER_01]: I even had this on the Game.com.

1231
01:24:31,270 --> 01:24:32,371
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's report this to Wesker.

1232
01:24:32,987 --> 01:24:43,475
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm reminded of a, um, I'm not sure if it was the Advance, but there was a Resident Evil novel guidance side story where it's Leon and Barry on a cruise ship, I think.

1233
01:24:43,836 --> 01:24:44,616
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you were right.

1234
01:24:45,057 --> 01:24:49,660
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me... I don't think it's canon, because that's some obscure stuff.

1235
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:53,984
[SPEAKER_04]: There were the Umbrella Chronicles, the Darkside Chronicles, Resident Evil Outbreak.

1236
01:24:56,145 --> 01:24:57,847
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, it was a mobile one you said?

1237
01:24:58,327 --> 01:24:58,727
[SPEAKER_04]: Or handheld?

1238
01:24:58,747 --> 01:24:58,908
[SPEAKER_04]: Handheld.

1239
01:24:58,928 --> 01:24:59,288
[SPEAKER_06]: Handheld.

1240
01:25:00,731 --> 01:25:00,971
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.

1241
01:25:02,031 --> 01:25:07,573
[SPEAKER_03]: There was Biohazard Eye Survivor and Resident Evil Assault the Nightmare.

1242
01:25:09,113 --> 01:25:13,334
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, actually, one of my favorites in the series was Gun Survivor, which I got to play in the arcade.

1243
01:25:13,354 --> 01:25:14,534
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, the Gun Con?

1244
01:25:14,574 --> 01:25:16,755
[SPEAKER_06]: No, Gun Con was Namco.

1245
01:25:16,835 --> 01:25:17,495
[SPEAKER_06]: The accessory.

1246
01:25:17,855 --> 01:25:20,456
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, in Japan, you could play it with the gun.

1247
01:25:20,696 --> 01:25:20,876
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1248
01:25:21,536 --> 01:25:24,397
[SPEAKER_04]: But in the U.S., it... Oh, yeah, because you can't use those here.

1249
01:25:24,777 --> 01:25:25,397
[SPEAKER_06]: They're taboo.

1250
01:25:26,657 --> 01:25:53,219
[SPEAKER_04]: which I always thought it would have been perfect to do it on the Dreamcast but you couldn't play Gun Survivor you just navigated through but I thought that with the D-pad that was on the gun you should have been able to control with that although the arcade version was really cool because you walked by pressing forward with the gun and you could back up it was really fun but the first Gun Survivor one I think was Code Veronica or was it the second one?

1251
01:25:54,520 --> 01:25:55,361
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that was the second one.

1252
01:25:56,342 --> 01:25:57,003
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's the one I played.

1253
01:26:00,006 --> 01:26:03,710
[SPEAKER_04]: There was also Resident Evil Operation Raccoon City that was another one.

1254
01:26:04,751 --> 01:26:09,957
[SPEAKER_04]: It's supposed to be coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and on Windows.

1255
01:26:10,498 --> 01:26:12,320
[SPEAKER_04]: And Resident Evil 6 is also coming out.

1256
01:26:14,119 --> 01:26:15,920
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, all kinds of stuff going on.

1257
01:26:15,980 --> 01:26:20,141
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's movies, which the movies don't really have a lot to do with the game.

1258
01:26:20,741 --> 01:26:21,922
[SPEAKER_04]: Not anymore, really.

1259
01:26:22,822 --> 01:26:25,083
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a few things that are in common.

1260
01:26:25,983 --> 01:26:28,744
[SPEAKER_04]: And there were all kinds of comics went out.

1261
01:26:28,784 --> 01:26:31,985
[SPEAKER_03]: They did a Mantua, which the Code Veronica one was actually really good.

1262
01:26:32,085 --> 01:26:32,505
[SPEAKER_04]: I liked it.

1263
01:26:33,785 --> 01:26:34,726
[SPEAKER_03]: All kinds of cool stuff.

1264
01:26:35,326 --> 01:26:36,887
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, Resident Evil.

1265
01:26:37,207 --> 01:26:40,248
[SPEAKER_04]: Worst voice acting ever in the first one, but it's laughable.

1266
01:26:40,428 --> 01:26:41,168
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fantastic.

1267
01:26:42,064 --> 01:26:53,175
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Resident Evil of the 3D generation of consoles, the PlayStation 1, was the first game that really spawned an entirely new genre, which was survival horror.

1268
01:26:53,295 --> 01:26:57,018
[SPEAKER_06]: We have Resident Evil to thank for Silent Hill and that whole franchise.

1269
01:26:57,499 --> 01:27:00,722
[SPEAKER_04]: Although Silent Hill took a different turn in survival horror.

1270
01:27:01,550 --> 01:27:08,914
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yeah, but just the whole dark, you know, you against monsters, that whole scary thing, I think Resident Evil sort of laid down the foundation.

1271
01:27:09,054 --> 01:27:09,435
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1272
01:27:09,475 --> 01:27:14,217
[SPEAKER_10]: I always thought Friday the 13th on the Nintendo sponsor.

1273
01:27:14,297 --> 01:27:15,098
[SPEAKER_04]: No way, no way.

1274
01:27:15,138 --> 01:27:16,058
[SPEAKER_04]: It was Nightmare on Elm Street.

1275
01:27:18,060 --> 01:27:22,002
[SPEAKER_09]: Or maybe it was the Metal Gear, I think, was always kind of...

1276
01:27:22,389 --> 01:27:23,510
[SPEAKER_09]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1277
01:27:39,668 --> 01:27:40,849
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, so is that it?

1278
01:27:40,909 --> 01:27:41,290
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it?

1279
01:27:41,510 --> 01:27:42,050
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it.

1280
01:27:42,070 --> 01:27:44,512
[SPEAKER_09]: Classic game of the week, Resident Evil.

1281
01:27:44,712 --> 01:27:46,654
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, there's actually one more thing before I forget.

1282
01:27:46,694 --> 01:27:47,395
[SPEAKER_09]: Make it quick.

1283
01:27:47,595 --> 01:27:48,075
[SPEAKER_04]: Resident Evil 1.5.

1284
01:27:48,296 --> 01:27:49,236
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.

1285
01:27:49,937 --> 01:28:05,871
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a beta of Resident Evil 2 that had a different character named Elza Walker and Leon and she was like a motorcycle chick wearing the red and white leathers and they actually ended up scrapping it when it was about 60% done.

1286
01:28:07,712 --> 01:28:31,703
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to get my hands on one of those I think my N64 box the console system when the N64 first came out you know how they have on the side of the box the game like if you buy this console here are the games that are coming out I have one that has a Resident Evil 1.5 or 2 it was supposed to be Resident Evil 2 yeah that's on that and it never came out I guess for that system

1287
01:28:32,341 --> 01:28:32,882
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura,

1288
01:28:48,641 --> 01:28:50,122
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see what she picks next week.

1289
01:29:12,950 --> 01:29:14,773
[SPEAKER_09]: So that could be very interesting.

1290
01:29:14,793 --> 01:29:19,239
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to talk about all that right after this when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1291
01:29:25,962 --> 01:29:28,744
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1292
01:29:43,852 --> 01:29:45,012

[SPEAKER_04]: Listen to us.

1300
01:30:06,419 --> 01:30:07,039

[SPEAKER_04]: Listen to us and give us a five star.

1302
01:30:09,832 --> 01:30:10,713
[SPEAKER_09]: Also pretty fun.

1303

[SPEAKER_09]: The Best Little Horde House in Azeroth.

1304

[SPEAKER_09]: It's a little side project Extifer and I have all about the world of Warcraft.

[SPEAKER_09]: www.hordehouse.com for more information.

1306
01:30:20,925 --> 01:30:22,788
[SPEAKER_09]: That's H-O-R-D-E-H-O-U-S-E.

1307
01:30:23,549 --> 01:30:24,830
[SPEAKER_09]: Up to 20 episodes this week.

1308
01:30:24,950 --> 01:30:25,811
[SPEAKER_09]: Woo!

1309
01:30:25,952 --> 01:30:26,552
[SPEAKER_09]: We hit 30.

1310
01:30:26,913 --> 01:30:27,373
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.

1311
01:30:27,514 --> 01:30:28,074
[SPEAKER_09]: You're old.

1312
01:30:28,835 --> 01:30:30,976
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh wait, we're on 408 of this show.

1313
01:30:31,056 --> 01:30:31,557
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, right?

1314
01:30:32,577 --> 01:30:32,857
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

1315
01:30:33,498 --> 01:30:38,360
[SPEAKER_09]: Quickly, gonna go to the rapid fire news and the tweets and all that stuff.

1316
01:30:38,380 --> 01:30:52,908
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanted to ask us, let's just pop really quick though, speaking of Twitter and all that, some folks saw that you were doing a little bit of fundraising this week by selling off some of your video game collection, which I know is probably not an easy thing to do, but what were some of the stuff you sold this week and how did it do?

1317
01:30:54,529 --> 01:31:02,016
[SPEAKER_06]: My most coveted title that I got rid of was Magic Knight Rayearth by Working Designs for the Sega Saturn.

1318
01:31:02,056 --> 01:31:08,341
[SPEAKER_06]: It was the last game put out in the US for the Saturn months after the Saturn was already dead and buried.

1319
01:31:08,421 --> 01:31:09,322
[SPEAKER_06]: They put this out.

1320
01:31:10,163 --> 01:31:13,025
[SPEAKER_06]: Even more rare, I think, than Panzer Dragoon Saga, I want to say.

1321
01:31:13,085 --> 01:31:15,007
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty... It's up there.

1322
01:31:15,127 --> 01:31:17,189
[SPEAKER_04]: Although, Panzer Dragoon RPG...

1323
01:31:18,970 --> 01:31:24,253
[SPEAKER_04]: was, I don't know, the two of them are pretty much rivals for hardest to find.

1324
01:31:24,673 --> 01:31:31,436
[SPEAKER_06]: And so Rayearth was a top-down, basically it was a Legend of Zelda Link to the Past clone as far as visually how it looked.

1325
01:31:31,996 --> 01:31:33,097
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a sort of RPG.

1326
01:31:34,138 --> 01:31:37,201
[SPEAKER_06]: Anime cutscenes, it had the intro, the clamp anime.

1327
01:31:37,401 --> 01:31:38,182
[SPEAKER_06]: Beautiful show.

1328
01:31:38,363 --> 01:31:45,591
[SPEAKER_04]: They did such a good job with translating it, especially since they don't talk every time you touch something, like in a Japanese one.

1329
01:31:46,072 --> 01:31:47,293
[SPEAKER_04]: It saved so much memory.

1330
01:31:47,814 --> 01:31:48,575
[SPEAKER_04]: It was so much better.

1331
01:31:48,795 --> 01:31:48,975
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1332
01:31:49,856 --> 01:31:55,541
[SPEAKER_06]: So that went for... I've seen it go for over $100, but I got around $80 for it.

1333
01:31:55,561 --> 01:31:56,943
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not too bad.

1334
01:31:57,023 --> 01:31:57,843
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1335
01:31:57,904 --> 01:31:58,604
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

1336
01:31:58,704 --> 01:31:59,345
[SPEAKER_06]: I never played it.

1337
01:31:59,465 --> 01:32:01,126
[SPEAKER_06]: I opened it, loaded it, go, oh, neat.

1338
01:32:01,687 --> 01:32:02,288
[SPEAKER_06]: Never touched it.

1339
01:32:03,429 --> 01:32:03,889
[SPEAKER_04]: We've beaten it.

1340
01:32:04,870 --> 01:32:09,794
[SPEAKER_06]: Bust a Move, not the puzzle bobble thing, but it was released in the U.S.

1341
01:32:09,835 --> 01:32:10,775
[SPEAKER_06]: as Bust a Groove.

1342
01:32:10,795 --> 01:32:11,716
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1343
01:32:13,038 --> 01:32:15,982
[SPEAKER_06]: The soundtrack, I think, in the JP edition is a lot better.

1344
01:32:17,284 --> 01:32:24,234
[SPEAKER_06]: Paper Mario 64, Ogre Battle 64, and a bunch of Saturn import stuff.

1345
01:32:24,995 --> 01:32:27,419
[SPEAKER_06]: Darkstalkers, X-Men vs. Street Fighter.

1346
01:32:28,680 --> 01:32:35,464
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm going to have a round two of stuff going up next week, one of which will include the PS2 edition of Rez.

1347
01:32:35,884 --> 01:32:36,704
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm getting rid of that.

1348
01:32:36,984 --> 01:32:37,204
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, wow.

1349
01:32:37,284 --> 01:32:39,005
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I have it Rez HD on Xbox 360.

1350
01:32:39,045 --> 01:32:40,086
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

1351
01:32:40,526 --> 01:32:42,627
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think some DDR games you were going to get rid of too, right?

1352
01:32:43,487 --> 01:32:51,131
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm selling my PS1 third mix and best hits, which I think came out after fourth and before fifth.

1353
01:32:51,151 --> 01:32:52,032
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me talk to you about Rez.

1354
01:32:52,812 --> 01:32:52,952
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1355
01:32:54,079 --> 01:32:54,359
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1356
01:32:54,599 --> 01:32:54,779
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1357
01:32:55,079 --> 01:32:56,020
[SPEAKER_09]: So check that out.

1358
01:32:56,140 --> 01:32:56,720
[SPEAKER_09]: That'll be up soon.

1359
01:32:57,660 --> 01:33:01,261
[SPEAKER_06]: The reason, you know, I'm getting rid of these is because they're in great shape.

1360
01:33:01,301 --> 01:33:15,945
[SPEAKER_06]: I know I'm never going to play them again, but actually having them in my hand, I wanted to hook my Saturn up to play some, you know, Vampire Savior, even though if it wasn't for me selling them, I never would have had the inkling to ever touch the game again, even though it's a great game.

1361
01:33:16,685 --> 01:33:22,210
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just weird how you're attached to something, but you know you'd never play it unless you're confronted with getting rid of it.

1362
01:33:22,410 --> 01:33:24,532
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just weird how nostalgia works.

1363
01:33:24,872 --> 01:33:31,919
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of how our vault is, except we sometimes do get the wild hair to break out one of the systems and play it.

1364
01:33:32,319 --> 01:33:38,064
[SPEAKER_04]: The whole reason we have so many systems is because nothing quite mimics having the controller in your hand.

1365
01:33:38,344 --> 01:33:41,367
[SPEAKER_04]: You can play Vampire Savior with us.

1366
01:33:41,707 --> 01:33:42,428
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll hook up to Saturn.

1367
01:33:43,971 --> 01:33:44,211
[SPEAKER_09]: Number Porn

1368
01:34:02,212 --> 01:34:03,775
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, there's some cool announcements.

1369
01:34:04,175 --> 01:34:07,861
[SPEAKER_10]: Choplifter HD, it's a remake of the classic game.

1370
01:34:07,881 --> 01:34:11,446
[SPEAKER_10]: It's supposed to be coming out on the PlayStation Network and PC this fall.

1371
01:34:12,147 --> 01:34:15,592
[SPEAKER_10]: And based on some of the screenshots here...

1372
01:34:18,630 --> 01:34:24,834
[SPEAKER_10]: Looks a little, I guess it looks pretty much like a classic game, just with the 3D, HD visuals.

1373
01:34:27,296 --> 01:34:28,016
[SPEAKER_10]: Kind of cool looking.

1374
01:34:28,537 --> 01:34:28,857
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1375
01:34:28,937 --> 01:34:29,798
[SPEAKER_10]: Hopefully it turns out well.

1376
01:34:30,618 --> 01:34:35,241
[SPEAKER_10]: And then another remake also in the works, Warlords.

1377
01:34:36,042 --> 01:34:37,983
[SPEAKER_10]: The old Atari game is being remade.

1378
01:34:38,383 --> 01:34:42,406
[SPEAKER_10]: That one's coming to Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network this summer.

1379
01:34:42,426 --> 01:34:48,290
[SPEAKER_10]: You probably can expect that as part of the Summer of Gaming or whatever the hell they call it on the Xbox Live.

1380
01:34:49,350 --> 01:35:08,480
[SPEAKER_10]: they're saying that it's gonna also I guess have the classic version as well as an evolved version I guess which was found or they had the evolved version which was in a previous Xbox Live Arcade release but this I guess is going to be something different I don't know

1381
01:35:09,821 --> 01:35:10,883
[SPEAKER_10]: And then finally, Minecraft goes into beta 1.4.

1382
01:35:11,063 --> 01:35:14,748
[SPEAKER_10]: And they added the wolves, cookies, and some other stuff.

1383
01:35:27,445 --> 01:35:45,938
[SPEAKER_10]: um yeah tamable wolves cookies sleeping in a bed now resets your spawn position a new logo holding shift while climbing will hang on to the ladder spiders no longer trample crops and lots of lots and lots of infrastructure and statistic lists and achievements

1384
01:35:48,707 --> 01:35:50,189
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, neat.

1385
01:35:50,569 --> 01:35:51,830
[SPEAKER_10]: Have you played Minecraft yet?

1386
01:35:51,910 --> 01:35:52,831
[SPEAKER_10]: I still have not played Minecraft.

1387
01:35:52,851 --> 01:35:53,472
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I have not either.

1388
01:35:53,852 --> 01:35:58,937
[SPEAKER_04]: I watched a funny video today though of some girl's Minecraft house and she was just really funny.

1389
01:35:59,417 --> 01:36:03,741
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, oh my god, there's like 400 pounds of bacon right here and there were like pigs everywhere in front of her house.

1390
01:36:04,482 --> 01:36:05,002
[SPEAKER_04]: It was really funny.

1391
01:36:05,183 --> 01:36:05,343
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.

1392
01:36:06,868 --> 01:36:09,569
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't played Minecraft, but yet I've played SingStar.

1393
01:36:09,910 --> 01:36:14,453
[SPEAKER_09]: And SingStar is adding 40 new songs to the store, or did add 40 new songs to the store this week.

1394
01:36:14,833 --> 01:36:23,138
[SPEAKER_09]: Now you can sing along with such karaoke classics as Cryin' by Aerosmith, Who Let the Dogs Out by the Baja Men, Crocodile Rock by Elton John.

1395
01:36:24,139 --> 01:36:24,539
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.

1396
01:36:25,560 --> 01:36:27,722
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm Good, I'm Gone by Leaky Lee.

1397
01:36:27,922 --> 01:36:28,562
[SPEAKER_09]: Likey Lee?

1398
01:36:28,742 --> 01:36:30,003
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't even know how to say her name.

1399
01:36:30,043 --> 01:36:30,663
[SPEAKER_09]: Likey Lie.

1400
01:36:31,104 --> 01:36:32,465
[SPEAKER_09]: She's crazier than Bjerk.

1401
01:36:32,905 --> 01:36:35,827
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know how you would sing along to that, but you can now.

1402
01:36:36,427 --> 01:36:46,211
[SPEAKER_09]: Grace Kelly by Mika, a bunch of songs by the band Razorlight, and oh, just for Salacious Pop, I know you love the Pussycat Dolls, so you can do Hush Hush now on SingStar.

1403
01:36:48,432 --> 01:36:54,494
[SPEAKER_09]: Also some dance add-ons have been sold as well, and then most interesting in a way, classical song packs.

1404
01:36:55,015 --> 01:37:04,959
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure how exactly you sing to the, I guess maybe it's old opera style, I don't know, but you can do Oh Sole Mio by DiCapua, Mozart with Queen of the Night Aria,

1405
01:37:05,959 --> 01:37:08,040
[SPEAKER_09]: La Donna Immobile by Verdi.

1406
01:37:08,680 --> 01:37:11,941
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know why, but yeah, now classic songs are available.

1407
01:37:12,161 --> 01:37:13,481
[SPEAKER_06]: I knew high school singers.

1408
01:37:14,142 --> 01:37:16,422
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a series that's like Buku Crazy in Europe, right?

1409
01:37:16,742 --> 01:37:18,603
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's pretty big over there.

1410
01:37:18,823 --> 01:37:20,764
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're okay games here.

1411
01:37:20,864 --> 01:37:24,165
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, they had like the SingStar Queen and the SingStar Abba.

1412
01:37:24,425 --> 01:37:30,967
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, probably the biggest thing about this is that the actual music videos, if available, play behind the song when you're singing it.

1413
01:37:30,987 --> 01:37:31,547
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's pretty cool.

1414
01:37:31,987 --> 01:37:34,428
[SPEAKER_10]: Can't wait to see the music video for the Mozart stuff.

1415
01:37:34,688 --> 01:37:36,629
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, I'm kind of wondering how that's going to work.

1416
01:37:36,669 --> 01:37:39,069
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess they have some generic video in the background there.

1417
01:37:39,109 --> 01:37:39,469
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1418
01:37:40,089 --> 01:37:43,990
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, some more information following, unfortunately, the tragedy in Japan.

1419
01:37:44,230 --> 01:37:48,251
[SPEAKER_09]: It has some folks asking a little bit forward, what's going to happen to Tokyo Game Show 2011?

1420
01:37:48,391 --> 01:37:55,713
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, now, there's no plans to cancel the Tokyo Game Show just yet, but they are saying it could happen in a reduced state.

1421
01:37:56,113 --> 01:37:59,634
[SPEAKER_09]: This is in an interview that the Tokyo Game Show officials did with Kotaku.

1422
01:38:00,274 --> 01:38:02,795
[SPEAKER_09]: They didn't say anything yet, but they did say, quote,

1423
01:38:03,095 --> 01:38:08,080
[SPEAKER_09]: Depending on the situation from here on out, it's possible that the show is reduced.

1424
01:38:08,540 --> 01:38:10,803
[SPEAKER_09]: The show is scheduled to take place in September.

1425
01:38:11,503 --> 01:38:16,728
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure it'll still be a pretty big thing and they haven't said, oh, it's closed off to the public or any of that yet.

1426
01:38:17,469 --> 01:38:23,555
[SPEAKER_09]: But they are treading a little bit carefully with a lot of uncertainty still happening in the world after the show.

1427
01:38:23,895 --> 01:38:24,556
[SPEAKER_09]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1428
01:38:42,854 --> 01:38:47,680
[SPEAKER_09]: and Akira Yamaoka, who of course was one of the minds behind Silent Hill and so forth.

1429
01:38:47,740 --> 01:38:50,423
[SPEAKER_09]: He is doing a benefit album for Tsunami survivors.

1430
01:38:50,463 --> 01:38:57,111
[SPEAKER_09]: It's called Play for Japan, kind of a play on words of the Pray for Japan Twitter hashtag that was going on at the time.

1431
01:38:57,611 --> 01:38:59,432
[SPEAKER_09]: BattleStarGalactica BattleStarGalactica BattleStarGalactica

1432
01:39:16,258 --> 01:39:18,439
[SPEAKER_09]: God, that had a great soundtrack, that show.

1433
01:39:18,899 --> 01:39:20,940
[SPEAKER_09]: And Woody Jackson, who did Red Dead Redemption.

1434
01:39:21,020 --> 01:39:25,082
[SPEAKER_09]: So some Western influence as well as from Japan.

1435
01:39:25,422 --> 01:39:26,462
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's pretty awesome.

1436
01:39:27,002 --> 01:39:32,565
[SPEAKER_09]: Kiriyamaoka also posted a letter at playforjapan.org, available in several languages.

1437
01:39:32,745 --> 01:39:33,405
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's pretty cool.

1438
01:39:33,445 --> 01:39:36,247
[SPEAKER_09]: It's supposed to come out in May 2011 on iTunes.

1439
01:39:36,787 --> 01:39:41,869
[SPEAKER_09]: So you don't even have to leave the house to do your little bit to help support the Japanese relief.

1440
01:39:41,909 --> 01:39:42,870
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's a great idea.

1441
01:39:43,730 --> 01:39:44,490
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's move on.

1442
01:39:45,111 --> 01:39:45,611
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.

1443
01:39:47,011 --> 01:39:51,753
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we have some Street Fighter news actually coming out of the UK.

1444
01:39:52,613 --> 01:40:00,576
[SPEAKER_04]: There was registered for the BBFC for Super Street Fighter 4 Arcade Edition to be coming out in June.

1445
01:40:01,557 --> 01:40:06,519
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the British Board of Film Classification, which also is in charge of video games for some reason.

1446
01:40:07,459 --> 01:40:08,379
[SPEAKER_04]: Why can't they do that here?

1447
01:40:08,960 --> 01:40:09,200
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

1448
01:40:10,901 --> 01:40:19,891
[SPEAKER_04]: Um... Capcom hasn't necessarily confirmed, but there's putting out that there's a... Um... That it could be download content.

1449
01:40:21,173 --> 01:40:22,194
[SPEAKER_04]: Or you can buy an expansion.

1450
01:40:22,234 --> 01:40:23,375
[SPEAKER_04]: They're still speculating.

1451
01:40:23,575 --> 01:40:23,676
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

1452
01:40:25,137 --> 01:40:25,877
[SPEAKER_04]: Music Unlimited

1453
01:40:56,781 --> 01:40:57,442
[SPEAKER_04]: from what it looks like.

1454
01:40:57,862 --> 01:41:03,306
[SPEAKER_09]: But like a legal way of doing it instead of like, you know, LimeWire or whatever the kids use these days.

1455
01:41:03,366 --> 01:41:04,006
[SPEAKER_09]: Bit torn, I guess.

1456
01:41:04,286 --> 01:41:04,526
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1457
01:41:05,507 --> 01:41:10,490
[SPEAKER_04]: And then in Rock Band 3 news, we have Joy Division download content, which I like Joy Division.

1458
01:41:10,871 --> 01:41:11,631
[SPEAKER_04]: But not just them.

1459
01:41:11,671 --> 01:41:15,294
[SPEAKER_04]: We have Grand Funk Railroad, The Locomotion, and we're an American band.

1460
01:41:15,974 --> 01:41:19,276
[SPEAKER_04]: And J. Giles Band Freeze Frame and Joy Division Love Will Tear Us Apart.

1461
01:41:21,218 --> 01:41:21,598
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

1462
01:41:22,074 --> 01:41:27,299
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's go to the Twitter, but first I want to read a comment here from our chatroom at chat.orangelaunchradio.com.

1463
01:41:28,020 --> 01:41:32,945
[SPEAKER_09]: Kassen in our chatroom says, I do not want the MPAA in charge of video game ratings.

1464
01:41:33,085 --> 01:41:34,266
[SPEAKER_09]: Those guys are idiots.

1465
01:41:35,187 --> 01:41:36,588
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, actually that's a really good point.

1466
01:41:36,608 --> 01:41:37,489
[SPEAKER_09]: Those guys are idiots.

1467
01:41:38,350 --> 01:41:40,372
[SPEAKER_09]: The way they rate some of those movies is unbelievable.

1468
01:41:40,885 --> 01:41:41,725
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's go to the Twitter!

1469
01:41:58,479 --> 01:42:01,702
[SPEAKER_09]: Twitter.com slash OLR is where you can send us tweets every week.

1470
01:42:02,483 --> 01:42:04,925
[SPEAKER_09]: We read your tweets here on the show and we'll respond to them.

1471
01:42:05,405 --> 01:42:12,392
[SPEAKER_09]: Fun ET Man sent us a tweet saying, I wonder if you will talk about this and sent us to an article on thelostlevels.org.

1472
01:42:12,692 --> 01:42:17,737
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a website that likes to kind of find old prototypes and things that have changed in games.

1473
01:42:18,057 --> 01:42:20,139
[SPEAKER_09]: They've done some stories on Zelda or whatever.

1474
01:42:20,459 --> 01:42:23,482
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, this article happens to be on the game Bio Force Ape.

1475
01:42:24,763 --> 01:42:29,305
[SPEAKER_09]: and I guess this is a game that was kind of recently finally dumped into a ROM.

1476
01:42:29,625 --> 01:42:30,225
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's the deal.

1477
01:42:30,245 --> 01:42:31,646
[SPEAKER_09]: This game never actually came out.

1478
01:42:31,786 --> 01:42:34,587
[SPEAKER_09]: It was teased in Nintendo Power in the early 90s.

1479
01:42:34,627 --> 01:42:35,687
[SPEAKER_09]: It was an NES game.

1480
01:42:36,187 --> 01:42:45,271
[SPEAKER_09]: And in this game, you take control of Bioforce Ape, a genetically altered super chimpanzee as he tries to make his way through a high-tech maze to rescue his adopted human family.

1481
01:42:45,311 --> 01:42:45,551
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

1482
01:42:45,931 --> 01:42:46,451
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, right?

1483
01:42:47,392 --> 01:42:54,377
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, one of the best parts of the game is when Bioforce 8 takes a wild, out-of-control ride on one of the speeding platforms, or coal cars.

1484
01:42:55,098 --> 01:42:57,059
[SPEAKER_09]: Animation is humorous, and so on and so on.

1485
01:42:57,559 --> 01:42:59,941
[SPEAKER_09]: And, yeah, so I guess there was this whole debacle.

1486
01:43:00,341 --> 01:43:09,148
[SPEAKER_09]: Somebody had the game, it came out in 2005 that the game was out there, and that there was photographic evidence taken, and I guess...

1487
01:43:09,908 --> 01:43:12,791
[SPEAKER_09]: Obviously, the thing had bugs in it and so forth.

1488
01:43:13,933 --> 01:43:19,158
[SPEAKER_09]: The guy was urged to sell the prototype, but he was really scared about the ROM getting out there.

1489
01:43:20,599 --> 01:43:26,085
[SPEAKER_09]: More stuff came out, including this humorous punching of a slime-looking thing that says, Eat Communism.

1490
01:43:26,105 --> 01:43:27,386
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like a monkey made out of butter.

1491
01:43:27,447 --> 01:43:27,907
[SPEAKER_06]: What is that?

1492
01:43:27,987 --> 01:43:28,728
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1493
01:43:48,815 --> 01:43:49,976
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

1494
01:44:10,286 --> 01:44:10,907
[SPEAKER_09]: Go, monkey, go!

1495
01:44:34,986 --> 01:44:36,627
[SPEAKER_09]: and teleporters and traps.

1496
01:44:37,187 --> 01:44:39,048
[SPEAKER_09]: So now you get teleporters in the game.

1497
01:44:39,408 --> 01:44:42,049
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, Snake360 had the four-player battles.

1498
01:44:42,129 --> 01:44:43,270
[SPEAKER_09]: It was very multiplayer.

1499
01:44:43,510 --> 01:44:46,891
[SPEAKER_09]: They really should just let him put it out on Xbox Live.

1500
01:44:46,931 --> 01:44:50,013
[SPEAKER_09]: It would be really cool if you could actually play it through the interwebs.

1501
01:44:50,233 --> 01:44:50,493
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.com

1502
01:45:10,813 --> 01:45:12,574
[SPEAKER_09]: Spazinator tweets us a story.

1503
01:45:12,634 --> 01:45:13,754
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a Sony story here.

1504
01:45:13,774 --> 01:45:14,695
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me see what this is all about.

1505
01:45:14,715 --> 01:45:15,315
[SPEAKER_09]: I got to load this.

1506
01:45:16,535 --> 01:45:17,196
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not loading.

1507
01:45:17,256 --> 01:45:17,876
[SPEAKER_09]: God damn it.

1508
01:45:17,896 --> 01:45:18,916
[SPEAKER_09]: He's trying to Rick Roll us.

1509
01:45:18,976 --> 01:45:19,837
[SPEAKER_09]: You little bastard.

1510
01:45:20,477 --> 01:45:21,618
[SPEAKER_09]: I cut it off before he could.

1511
01:45:21,778 --> 01:45:22,258
[SPEAKER_06]: Was that real?

1512
01:45:23,078 --> 01:45:23,819
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it started to come up.

1513
01:45:23,839 --> 01:45:24,519
[SPEAKER_09]: It said Rick Astley.

1514
01:45:24,559 --> 01:45:25,319
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, nope.

1515
01:45:26,100 --> 01:45:26,320
[SPEAKER_09]: Nope.

1516
01:45:26,440 --> 01:45:26,980
[SPEAKER_09]: Done with that.

1517
01:45:27,741 --> 01:45:29,561
[SPEAKER_09]: So congratulations, Spazinator.

1518
01:45:29,621 --> 01:45:32,223
[SPEAKER_09]: You have banned yourself from Twitter for one whole month.

1519
01:45:32,303 --> 01:45:34,724
[SPEAKER_09]: We will not be reading your tweets for one whole month.

1520
01:45:35,609 --> 01:45:35,909
[SPEAKER_09]: Burnout Crash

1521
01:45:49,576 --> 01:46:13,269
[SPEAKER_09]: Burnout Crash is coming to the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3 I guess EA hasn't announced a new Burnout game But Australia actually released a classification for Burnout Crash And I guess surfing some LinkedIn profiles it's found out that this is happening It's an Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 title No official announcement yet It seems logical there would be another Burnout game at some point

1522
01:46:13,829 --> 01:46:35,173
[SPEAKER_10]: hopefully it's a little more like the older games like I know the Burnout Paradise or whatever was really well supported but you know that franchise still sells really well right as far as I know yeah Paradise was awesome yeah so alright I mean come on you gotta love it's like oh any moment I wanna go in the crash mode okay crash mode it was awesome

1523
01:46:35,660 --> 01:46:38,344
[SPEAKER_09]: American's Average 13 Minutes Playing Video Games on TV Daily

1524
01:46:50,800 --> 01:46:51,861
[SPEAKER_09]: Only 13 minutes?

1525
01:46:52,681 --> 01:46:56,883
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's the people who play for four hours at a time, balancing out those that don't play at all.

1526
01:46:57,384 --> 01:46:58,224
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know how that works.

1527
01:46:58,284 --> 01:47:03,247
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, adults spend an average of 13 minutes a day using a TV to play video games.

1528
01:47:03,287 --> 01:47:06,248
[SPEAKER_09]: That's from Nielsen's State of the Media, U.S.

1529
01:47:06,368 --> 01:47:08,149
[SPEAKER_09]: TV Trends by Ethnicity.

1530
01:47:08,830 --> 01:47:09,110
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess...

1531
01:47:09,810 --> 01:47:10,470
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1532
01:47:36,625 --> 01:47:39,149
[SPEAKER_09]: Ironically enough, though, you have to admit this is a little bit ironic.

1533
01:47:39,209 --> 01:47:47,439
[SPEAKER_09]: According to their little graph here, the smallest ethnicity, or I should say the smallest play time by any ethnicity, nine minutes, Asians.

1534
01:47:48,441 --> 01:47:48,721
[SPEAKER_09]: Who knew?

1535
01:47:50,303 --> 01:47:50,664
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

1536
01:47:52,466 --> 01:47:53,788
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they have the tiger mom.

1537
01:47:54,864 --> 01:47:55,865
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess, I don't know.

1538
01:47:56,185 --> 01:47:56,565
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1539
01:47:57,306 --> 01:47:58,127
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's move on.

1540
01:47:58,587 --> 01:48:00,429
[SPEAKER_09]: Something a little less racial, please.

1541
01:48:00,449 --> 01:48:00,789
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki.

1542
01:48:00,809 --> 01:48:02,110
[SPEAKER_10]: A little less racial?

1543
01:48:03,271 --> 01:48:03,911
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, fine.

1544
01:48:04,472 --> 01:48:07,714
[SPEAKER_10]: No, so we're going to talk a little bit about the 3DS.

1545
01:48:07,775 --> 01:48:10,657
[SPEAKER_10]: Obviously, 3DS probably did pretty well.

1546
01:48:10,777 --> 01:48:11,898
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I'd assume.

1547
01:48:12,498 --> 01:48:18,083
[SPEAKER_10]: Nintendo's saying it's the best first day handheld sales launch ever.

1548
01:48:18,924 --> 01:48:19,264
[SPEAKER_10]: So...

1549
01:48:20,865 --> 01:48:21,605
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1550
01:48:40,052 --> 01:48:42,073
[SPEAKER_10]: So, good for them, I suppose.

1551
01:48:43,734 --> 01:48:46,676
[SPEAKER_10]: Unfortunately, though, it wasn't without problems.

1552
01:48:46,856 --> 01:48:50,839
[SPEAKER_10]: There are some issues with the 3DS, including some crashes.

1553
01:48:50,919 --> 01:49:00,105
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently, people have been running into some software crashes that require the system to be shut off and then turned back on to get it playing right.

1554
01:49:00,505 --> 01:49:08,371
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently, this was fixed in the latest firmware, the one you download to get your little 3D video from OK Go.

1555
01:49:09,711 --> 01:49:38,418
[SPEAKER_10]: so that's kind of cool at least that's been fixed however something that's not really going to be able to be fixed within some sort of patching system is the fact that the hinges once again are loose or at least some people are reporting loose hinges which require you to actually send your system back in to get it repaired what a slut that 3DS must be totally loose I heard I haven't had that problem with loose hinge yet but I know it was something that plagued a lot of systems before especially on the DS Lite kind of sucks

1556
01:49:40,373 --> 01:49:42,274
[SPEAKER_09]: But thankfully, not a problem for me

1557
01:50:04,825 --> 01:50:05,386
[SPEAKER_09]: Lawsuit.

1558
01:50:05,986 --> 01:50:07,468
[SPEAKER_09]: Somebody is suing EA.

1559
01:50:08,269 --> 01:50:09,610
[SPEAKER_09]: There might be some weight to this one, though.

1560
01:50:09,630 --> 01:50:13,153
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not one of those class action lawsuits or somebody mad about something a little frivolous.

1561
01:50:13,173 --> 01:50:14,855
[SPEAKER_09]: This could have some actual weight to it.

1562
01:50:15,976 --> 01:50:17,938
[SPEAKER_09]: You know the game John Madden Football?

1563
01:50:18,018 --> 01:50:22,882
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you ought to, because this is the series that became Madden NFL, like what, 07, 08, 09, 11, 10, every year.

1564
01:50:22,902 --> 01:50:23,323
[SPEAKER_09]: Annual sequel.

1565
01:50:25,745 --> 01:50:26,465
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1566
01:50:53,251 --> 01:50:55,132
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's not like totally freaking gray.

1567
01:50:55,192 --> 01:50:57,633
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, this is a long old game.

1568
01:50:58,153 --> 01:51:14,320
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, my point with this here is that Robin Antonik, who created the very first game and you see his name there in the programming there in Madden, apparently 23 years after this very first game, he is not seeing any revenue from it.

1569
01:51:14,760 --> 01:51:25,905
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, he has filed suit against Electronic Arts for tens of millions in royalties, and apparently he was responsible for the development of virtually all the groundbreaking technology at the heart of the game.

1570
01:51:26,225 --> 01:51:28,186
[SPEAKER_09]: That's at least what he claims in his suit.

1571
01:51:28,886 --> 01:51:36,549
[SPEAKER_09]: EA has not paid this guy any royalties since 1992 was the last time he got royalties.

1572
01:51:37,350 --> 01:51:37,810
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

1573
01:51:38,630 --> 01:51:40,491
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, he did make the original game.

1574
01:51:40,651 --> 01:51:41,852
[SPEAKER_09]: It was kind of his baby.

1575
01:51:42,552 --> 01:51:45,354
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I'm sure the game has changed many times since then.

1576
01:51:45,734 --> 01:51:49,496
[SPEAKER_09]: Something you may not know, John Madden Football did not have actual NFL teams.

1577
01:51:49,536 --> 01:51:51,217
[SPEAKER_09]: They didn't have the NFL license at the time.

1578
01:51:51,758 --> 01:51:53,058
[SPEAKER_09]: EA got that years later.

1579
01:51:53,519 --> 01:51:57,601
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, you could say the game's changed a whole fuckton since the beginning.

1580
01:51:57,881 --> 01:51:59,422
[SPEAKER_09]: So maybe this guy doesn't deserve anything.

1581
01:51:59,822 --> 01:52:04,064
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yeah, I mean, it's John Madden's namesake that's the brand.

1582
01:52:04,645 --> 01:52:06,226
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, the actual announcer guy.

1583
01:52:07,326 --> 01:52:28,596
[SPEAKER_06]: but this person Robin sounds like he might have signed a bad contract when they took the license from him where he was paid up front for the concept of what it is but I'd have to read more about what the actual the complaint that was filed in court I would need to read that to know how reasonable this is

1584
01:52:29,096 --> 01:52:32,478
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, but so it's going to be interesting.

1585
01:52:32,538 --> 01:52:35,880
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, especially with such a huge franchise to see kind of what happens with this.

1586
01:52:35,900 --> 01:52:44,786
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, a lot of times, especially back in the day, I mean, back in the 80s, you know, this was always a huge thing where programmers really weren't getting the credit they deserved.

1587
01:52:44,826 --> 01:52:47,908
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, that was why Activision was kind of formed in the first place.

1588
01:52:48,428 --> 01:52:53,012
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a bunch of people really upset that programmers didn't get more credit in Atari games.

1589
01:52:53,432 --> 01:52:58,996
[SPEAKER_09]: The very first Easter egg in a video game was where the dude's initials were in Adventure.

1590
01:52:59,457 --> 01:53:04,861
[SPEAKER_09]: That was so that the guy could kind of sneak his credit in there because Atari never credited their programmers and game designers.

1591
01:53:05,161 --> 01:53:08,003
[SPEAKER_09]: But Activision, remember the names like David Crane and so forth?

1592
01:53:08,023 --> 01:53:10,105
[SPEAKER_09]: These guys would make the games and get to put their names on them.

1593
01:53:10,405 --> 01:53:13,928
[SPEAKER_09]: Because a lot of these Atari games were by one guy or two guys.

1594
01:53:14,708 --> 01:53:15,449
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're cool guys.

1595
01:53:44,768 --> 01:53:52,854
[SPEAKER_09]: so bad it's like the worst port ever but it's so funny because you play the old school Pac-Man on the 2600 and it really is garbage but then they had a Ms.

1596
01:53:52,894 --> 01:53:53,515
[SPEAKER_09]: Pac-Man later Ms.

1597
01:53:53,535 --> 01:53:59,179
[SPEAKER_09]: Pac-Man was great for an Atari game it was great well the reason why is because the Ms.

1598
01:53:59,199 --> 01:54:12,829
[SPEAKER_09]: Pac-Man was on like a 4K cart whereas the Pac-Man was on like half that maybe a quarter of that I don't know so like the whole like drawing one ghost every frame why the ghost flickered so terribly that was a restriction of the cartridge I mean think about it

1599
01:54:13,610 --> 01:54:18,151
[SPEAKER_09]: Those programmers had 2K to design an entire game.

1600
01:54:18,852 --> 01:54:20,452
[SPEAKER_09]: 2K is how long an essay is.

1601
01:54:20,832 --> 01:54:21,573
[SPEAKER_09]: It's crazy.

1602
01:54:23,673 --> 01:54:23,953
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow.

1603
01:54:26,814 --> 01:54:29,235
[SPEAKER_09]: Boy, we sure get into classic gaming discussion a lot on this show.

1604
01:54:29,275 --> 01:54:29,715
[SPEAKER_09]: It's pretty good.

1605
01:54:29,915 --> 01:54:31,016
[SPEAKER_09]: It's because we loves it.

1606
01:54:31,136 --> 01:54:31,396
[SPEAKER_09]: We do.

1607
01:54:31,996 --> 01:54:32,596
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're old.

1608
01:54:34,637 --> 01:54:35,257
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura?

1609
01:54:35,897 --> 01:54:36,197
[SPEAKER_09]: We?

1610
01:54:36,637 --> 01:54:37,418
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you mean we?

1611
01:54:37,698 --> 01:54:37,998
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

1612
01:54:38,038 --> 01:54:39,138
[SPEAKER_09]: Especially DarkSakura.

1613
01:54:39,198 --> 01:54:39,498
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey!

1614
01:54:40,559 --> 01:54:41,919
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't make me break out the Vuvuzela.

1615
01:54:43,376 --> 01:54:44,857
[SPEAKER_09]: How about I break out another news story?

1616
01:54:45,217 --> 01:54:53,384
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Monolith Soft's putting out a Wii RPG, Xenoblade, and it's being localized for Europe.

1617
01:54:54,104 --> 01:54:54,785
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay.

1618
01:54:57,146 --> 01:54:59,848
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually going up for Xenoblade Chronicles.

1619
01:55:00,849 --> 01:55:27,511
[SPEAKER_04]: that although the trailer itself is untranslated it shows basically all of the imagery going out Nintendo of Europe put out a press release and then removed it but somebody actually managed to get it out and get the information out and it's supposed to have English and Japanese voice options so maybe we'll get it here too

1620
01:55:28,055 --> 01:55:34,185
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm assuming if they're going to spend the time to translate into English that they're going to release it in more than one region.

1621
01:55:34,205 --> 01:55:38,311
[SPEAKER_09]: But what if there's like an elevator in the game and they call it a lift?

1622
01:55:38,612 --> 01:55:39,473
[SPEAKER_09]: Americans might not understand.

1623
01:55:39,493 --> 01:55:41,636
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my god, where will they find that?

1624
01:55:41,777 --> 01:55:42,778
[SPEAKER_10]: One employee do type...

1625
01:55:43,399 --> 01:55:44,240
[SPEAKER_10]: and Elevator.

1626
01:55:44,840 --> 01:55:45,440
[SPEAKER_10]: Woo!

1627
01:55:45,480 --> 01:55:47,221
[SPEAKER_10]: That was a day's work there.

1628
01:55:47,381 --> 01:55:55,406
[SPEAKER_09]: What if somebody in the game, maybe there's a smoking scene and the guy says he's going to go out and have a fag and that could never go over here in the U.S.

1629
01:55:55,486 --> 01:55:57,087
[SPEAKER_09]: because, like, you know, glad will sue.

1630
01:55:57,267 --> 01:56:01,930
[SPEAKER_10]: Once again, you know, that same employee on day two could easily type cigarette.

1631
01:56:02,846 --> 01:56:03,846
[SPEAKER_09]: This looks pretty good, though.

1632
01:56:04,086 --> 01:56:09,368
[SPEAKER_09]: Or maybe they're going to go out and have a crumpet and people will be like, they don't know what the fuck that is over in the United States.

1633
01:56:09,428 --> 01:56:10,508
[SPEAKER_09]: Pants versus trousers.

1634
01:56:10,648 --> 01:56:12,048
[SPEAKER_09]: People will just burst into tears.

1635
01:56:12,808 --> 01:56:14,729
[SPEAKER_04]: My favorite one is the word fanny.

1636
01:56:16,449 --> 01:56:17,570
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not just a pack anymore.

1637
01:56:18,090 --> 01:56:18,250
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1638
01:56:18,690 --> 01:56:19,790
[SPEAKER_04]: Fanny here is your butt.

1639
01:56:20,070 --> 01:56:20,830
[SPEAKER_04]: There's the vag.

1640
01:56:21,831 --> 01:56:22,251
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, my.

1641
01:56:22,691 --> 01:56:24,491
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that why a fanny pack is really in the front?

1642
01:56:26,172 --> 01:56:27,272
[SPEAKER_04]: A friend of mine explained that to me.

1643
01:56:27,332 --> 01:56:27,572
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course.

1644
01:56:27,932 --> 01:56:30,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know why I always giggle when I pass the catering place?

1645
01:56:30,793 --> 01:56:31,873
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's called Randy Peter's.

1646
01:56:32,540 --> 01:56:41,026
[SPEAKER_04]: All EA has to do is prove that his code was not used after 1992, or that the contract with them was only valid until 1992.

1647
01:56:41,086 --> 01:56:41,147
[SPEAKER_09]: Hmm.

1648
01:57:00,541 --> 01:57:04,384
[SPEAKER_09]: Spazinator says, yet Activision no longer gives credits and manuals anymore.

1649
01:57:04,584 --> 01:57:05,405
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, the irony.

1650
01:57:05,885 --> 01:57:08,867
[SPEAKER_09]: And DarkToagak follows that up with, what the fuck is a game manual?

1651
01:57:10,448 --> 01:57:11,909
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought they did have credits and game manuals.

1652
01:57:11,929 --> 01:57:13,130
[SPEAKER_09]: They were just like all the way in the back.

1653
01:57:13,210 --> 01:57:17,994
[SPEAKER_10]: They do, and then EA doesn't have manuals anymore, from what I remember.

1654
01:57:18,234 --> 01:57:18,494
[SPEAKER_09]: Really?

1655
01:57:18,614 --> 01:57:19,214
[SPEAKER_09]: They're all digital now.

1656
01:57:19,234 --> 01:57:19,975
[SPEAKER_10]: It's all online now?

1657
01:57:20,055 --> 01:57:20,716
[SPEAKER_09]: Digital manuals?

1658
01:57:20,916 --> 01:57:21,836
[SPEAKER_10]: It's all on the disc.

1659
01:57:22,177 --> 01:57:23,938
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you just have to make the information available.

1660
01:57:25,359 --> 01:57:26,800
[SPEAKER_04]: This game looks super pretty, by the way.

1661
01:57:27,604 --> 01:57:28,025
[SPEAKER_09]: Xenoblade

1662
01:57:50,405 --> 01:57:53,907
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, except that, you know, Sony decided, hey, you know what?

1663
01:57:54,147 --> 01:57:59,431
[SPEAKER_10]: We got this PlayStation phone coming out, so let's get it removed.

1664
01:57:59,591 --> 01:58:07,196
[SPEAKER_10]: So, PSX4Droid was removed from the Android marketplace without warning due to a content policy violation.

1665
01:58:08,977 --> 01:58:11,858
[SPEAKER_10]: He's, I guess, saying, you know, what the hell?

1666
01:58:11,898 --> 01:58:15,881
[SPEAKER_10]: He figured it was from the, you know, Xperia Play coming out.

1667
01:58:16,141 --> 01:58:16,901
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1668
01:58:42,877 --> 01:58:51,383
[SPEAKER_10]: And the initial offerings, of course, were Cool Boarders 2, Destruction Derby, Jumping Flash, Medieval 2, and Syphon Filter.

1669
01:58:52,324 --> 01:58:55,526
[SPEAKER_10]: And all those are available for $6, or €3.99.

1670
01:58:57,788 --> 01:59:02,091
[SPEAKER_10]: And I guess it's the same price that they're going on the PlayStation Network right now.

1671
01:59:05,333 --> 01:59:06,875
[SPEAKER_10]: It is kind of funny, though.

1672
01:59:06,895 --> 01:59:08,075
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess they're saying that...

1673
01:59:11,027 --> 01:59:11,387
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1674
01:59:12,248 --> 01:59:17,414
[SPEAKER_10]: I would think... I thought the marketplace for Android was open.

1675
01:59:17,454 --> 01:59:27,665
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, if you can't get your app on the Android marketplace, I mean, there's other marketplaces out there where you can, I don't know, upload it somewhere else and someone can download it from that website.

1676
01:59:27,825 --> 01:59:28,746
[SPEAKER_10]: Am I correct, I think?

1677
01:59:29,486 --> 01:59:33,691
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I know they have the Amazon marketplace now, and obviously that's not on the Android marketplace.

1678
01:59:36,443 --> 01:59:38,024
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, iPhones all different.

1679
01:59:38,305 --> 01:59:39,526
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, everyone in here has an iPhone.

1680
01:59:39,546 --> 01:59:40,726
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I know, so sorry.

1681
01:59:40,907 --> 01:59:42,968
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't mean to be ignorant, but it's how it is.

1682
01:59:43,649 --> 02:00:00,242
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I mean, that sucks, I guess, but it makes sense because obviously if there's a free PlayStation or even a PlayStation that you can buy and then download the ROMs for, that would kind of defeat the point of having to buy all these different games.

1683
02:00:00,902 --> 02:00:01,022
[SPEAKER_10]: And...

1684
02:00:02,344 --> 02:00:12,759
[SPEAKER_10]: If it is anything like a normal Android phone, if people really want to, since it is legal to jailbreak your phone, you could jailbreak or root your phone and download this anyways.

1685
02:00:14,001 --> 02:00:16,324
[SPEAKER_09]: Really, why play a PlayStation game on your phone?

1686
02:00:16,785 --> 02:00:16,985
[SPEAKER_09]: You know?

1687
02:00:17,745 --> 02:00:20,726
[SPEAKER_10]: Why buy a phone that's meant for playing PlayStation games?

1688
02:00:36,951 --> 02:00:45,037
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think of like, how in the fuck are you supposed to play a PlayStation game with that type of setup?

1689
02:00:45,057 --> 02:00:48,819
[SPEAKER_09]: But then I forget, oh yeah, these Xperia Plays and stuff, they actually have buttons.

1690
02:00:48,839 --> 02:00:50,600
[SPEAKER_09]: They're like PSPs, but they actually work as phones.

1691
02:00:50,620 --> 02:00:52,021
[SPEAKER_09]: So that makes a lot more sense to me.

1692
02:01:07,212 --> 02:01:07,613
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1693
02:01:07,673 --> 02:01:10,717
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it's not like this thing plays PSP games.

1694
02:01:11,157 --> 02:01:12,579
[SPEAKER_10]: It plays PlayStation 1 games.

1695
02:01:12,679 --> 02:01:13,400
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, really?

1696
02:01:14,242 --> 02:01:16,304
[SPEAKER_10]: Your PSP will play PlayStation 1 games, too.

1697
02:01:16,344 --> 02:01:16,865
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

1698
02:01:16,925 --> 02:01:22,653
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, if you really want something to play PlayStation 1 games on, seriously, go find a Generation 1 PSP.

1699
02:01:24,455 --> 02:01:26,956
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my god, that would probably be pretty dirt cheap.

1700
02:01:27,456 --> 02:01:36,599
[SPEAKER_09]: Or go to a farmer's market auction thing that has the, you know, I'm thinking like Denio is here locally, but they have PlayStations everywhere.

1701
02:01:36,659 --> 02:01:38,520
[SPEAKER_10]: There are PSPs everywhere.

1702
02:01:39,260 --> 02:01:40,701
[SPEAKER_10]: Even an actual PlayStation 1's.

1703
02:01:42,214 --> 02:01:48,616
[SPEAKER_10]: I wouldn't... Yeah, PlayStation 1's... On the go, PlayStation 1's not very portable.

1704
02:01:48,997 --> 02:01:55,879
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, you could technically do it with a battery pack and stuff, but it's... I seem to remember some little screen you could plug in the back of the base.

1705
02:01:55,899 --> 02:01:56,639
[SPEAKER_09]: They have the screen.

1706
02:01:56,679 --> 02:01:59,961
[SPEAKER_10]: They do have the screen, and they're used for hacking stuff quite a bit.

1707
02:02:00,641 --> 02:02:06,043
[SPEAKER_10]: They're definitely used for portable consoles more than the actual PlayStation 1, but...

1708
02:02:06,543 --> 02:02:10,947
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, seriously, you just buy a PSP and just play your PlayStation 1 games on there if you really want to do it.

1709
02:02:10,987 --> 02:02:14,990
[SPEAKER_10]: And that way you don't get locked into a contract and you don't need to buy this expensive phone for it.

1710
02:02:15,010 --> 02:02:17,532
[SPEAKER_10]: But people like gaming on the phone.

1711
02:02:18,773 --> 02:02:20,234
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's my thing.

1712
02:02:20,414 --> 02:02:24,277
[SPEAKER_10]: It's good that they have these buttons, but are all the developers really using it?

1713
02:02:24,617 --> 02:02:25,398
[SPEAKER_10]: No, they are not.

1714
02:02:25,578 --> 02:02:35,846
[SPEAKER_10]: So don't expect to buy this and go all of a sudden, oh, hey, now I can play Mega Man 2 or something like that really easily using the buttons because you're not going to be able to.

1715
02:02:37,287 --> 02:02:37,648
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1716
02:02:37,748 --> 02:02:39,350
[SPEAKER_10]: It's whatever.

1717
02:02:39,410 --> 02:02:43,114
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, if you want to do this, this is something for you.

1718
02:02:43,174 --> 02:02:44,877
[SPEAKER_09]: Just, you know, know it's out there now.

1719
02:02:45,377 --> 02:02:49,242
[SPEAKER_09]: Misty in our chat room says, speaking of iPhones, someone needs to get theirs away from a mic.

1720
02:02:49,562 --> 02:02:49,863
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie?

1721
02:02:51,445 --> 02:02:52,666
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm dealing something with Dan.

1722
02:02:53,127 --> 02:02:54,789
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, well, still, it's... I moved it.

1723
02:02:54,829 --> 02:02:55,429
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, it's over here.

1724
02:02:58,504 --> 02:03:06,612
[SPEAKER_09]: And you know, whenever anybody hears that do-do-do tone, like everybody looks at their iPhone, any iPhone owner, whenever that, there's some commercial on the radio that uses that tone, and it's terrible.

1725
02:03:06,652 --> 02:03:14,539
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't do that because my volume on my iPod is turned off, and also my iPod is turned off, like a normal person would.

1726
02:03:16,021 --> 02:03:17,622
[SPEAKER_09]: You iPhone people, crazy.

1727
02:03:18,720 --> 02:03:21,784
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, maybe my mommy needs to contact me in an emergency.

1728
02:03:22,785 --> 02:03:23,286
[SPEAKER_04]: She would text me.

1729
02:03:23,306 --> 02:03:26,230
[SPEAKER_04]: My husband's two states away, so I'm trying to keep in touch with him.

1730
02:03:26,390 --> 02:03:27,151
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I understand that.

1731
02:03:27,171 --> 02:03:28,833
[SPEAKER_10]: That's no problem, but I'm just saying, you know.

1732
02:03:31,946 --> 02:03:32,767
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what you're saying.

1733
02:03:49,776 --> 02:03:50,577
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1734
02:04:10,959 --> 02:04:17,208
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just that they just bank on people are going to stop caring after seven or eight years or whatever the abandonware sites say.

1735
02:04:17,569 --> 02:04:24,699
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I guess these sites were hosting Ultima 4 and sites have been giving away that game since like the late 90s.

1736
02:04:25,080 --> 02:04:26,281
[SPEAKER_09]: This game dates all the way back to 1985.

1737
02:04:27,463 --> 02:04:27,884
[SPEAKER_09]: and DarkSakura.

1738
02:04:43,823 --> 02:04:44,544
[SPEAKER_09]: All new MMOs from EA

1739
02:04:59,483 --> 02:05:28,864
[SPEAKER_09]: so could it be that EA is trying to protect this old IP all of a sudden because they're about to announce a new Ultima MMO at E3 who knows so of course as brought up earlier in the show Ultima Online has been out since 1997 and so it is a 14 year old game so maybe it's going to get an update and that could also explain this whole loyalty program thing coming out of the blue it seems like you know like maybe like a last hurrah for Ultima Online before they're about to announce something big at E3 who knows

1740
02:05:29,364 --> 02:05:38,988
[SPEAKER_06]: And the last time that we heard something about this happening was the Sarian games that had all the Space Quest and King's Quest for Sierra Online available to play.

1741
02:05:39,028 --> 02:05:43,990
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the fan, the fandom game, I'm blanking on the name.

1742
02:05:44,170 --> 02:05:44,671
[SPEAKER_06]: Silver Lining.

1743
02:05:44,731 --> 02:05:45,311
[SPEAKER_06]: Silver Lining.

1744
02:05:45,631 --> 02:05:52,354
[SPEAKER_06]: They got a C and D and we thought, oh, it's just, you know, the Activision being horrible, but it looked like, no, the Telltale or not.

1745
02:05:52,974 --> 02:06:21,260
[SPEAKER_06]: yeah Telltale's yeah Telltale got the King's Quest revamp license and it's like oh well maybe they weren't just being total assholes there's actually a relevant reason for them to do those CNDs this because that happened just one or two months ago that gives me reason to believe this Ultima story has can hold water very good point yeah all right well we'll see what happens I think E3 will be very telling this could be one of the big things they announced uh would there be interest in Ultima C Ultima was that was a big Richard Garriott thing too remember that was like his baby

1746
02:06:23,681 --> 02:06:28,444
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't actually own my own gaming PC or a PC period until like 95, 96.

1747
02:06:29,784 --> 02:06:35,948
[SPEAKER_06]: So all the Ultima stuff that came before, personally, I missed out on all of the Ultima stuff during the 80s.

1748
02:06:36,208 --> 02:06:38,609
[SPEAKER_09]: See, I owned 3 and 4 on the NES.

1749
02:06:38,809 --> 02:06:40,690
[SPEAKER_09]: I owned both of them on the NES, and they were great games.

1750
02:06:41,190 --> 02:06:42,651
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, they were really hardcore.

1751
02:06:43,011 --> 02:06:44,692
[SPEAKER_09]: They were not like Final Fantasy.

1752
02:06:44,712 --> 02:06:45,913
[SPEAKER_09]: They were pretty in-depth.

1753
02:06:46,093 --> 02:06:47,634
[SPEAKER_09]: I think 3 had an amazing soundtrack, too.

1754
02:06:47,654 --> 02:06:49,835
[SPEAKER_06]: Weren't they off a model of just Dungeons & Dragons?

1755
02:06:49,855 --> 02:06:51,256
[SPEAKER_04]: Which was Ultima Exodus?

1756
02:06:52,036 --> 02:06:52,997
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, was three.

1757
02:06:53,717 --> 02:06:54,918
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, because I tried playing that one.

1758
02:06:55,238 --> 02:06:56,639
[SPEAKER_04]: I had it on NES.

1759
02:06:56,799 --> 02:06:58,620
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, with the two moons that were always in the corner.

1760
02:06:58,640 --> 02:07:01,142
[SPEAKER_09]: It could be like the Cleric or the Druid.

1761
02:07:01,162 --> 02:07:02,463
[SPEAKER_09]: There was like a million classes in it.

1762
02:07:02,923 --> 02:07:03,844
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that was Ultima.

1763
02:07:03,864 --> 02:07:06,325
[SPEAKER_09]: And then there was Ultima Quest of the Avatar, which was a little more.

1764
02:07:06,646 --> 02:07:09,808
[SPEAKER_09]: But see, those games are really not like their PC counterparts.

1765
02:07:09,908 --> 02:07:13,590
[SPEAKER_09]: They were really, I don't want to say dumbed down, but they were really changed for the NES.

1766
02:07:13,630 --> 02:07:14,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Mine ended up under a lawnmower.

1767
02:07:16,512 --> 02:07:17,032
[SPEAKER_04]: Not my fault.

1768
02:07:17,232 --> 02:07:17,653
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

1769
02:07:18,953 --> 02:07:19,494
[SPEAKER_09]: Poor game.

1770
02:07:19,514 --> 02:07:19,814
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1771
02:07:20,475 --> 02:07:21,116
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

1772
02:07:32,930 --> 02:07:37,492
[SPEAKER_06]: There was one big one that 7, 8, or 9, I don't know, had a lot of hype to it.

1773
02:07:37,712 --> 02:07:39,853
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, so, well, they all had some hype to them.

1774
02:07:39,873 --> 02:07:41,534
[SPEAKER_09]: But now Richard Garriott's long gone, you know?

1775
02:07:41,634 --> 02:07:47,016
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I mean, he's not, like, dead or anything, but he went off and did Tabula Rasa, which tanked, unfortunately, for him.

1776
02:07:47,336 --> 02:07:48,757
[SPEAKER_09]: That was the whole space MMO.

1777
02:07:48,797 --> 02:07:51,598
[SPEAKER_06]: That was an NCSoft free... It was not free.

1778
02:07:51,618 --> 02:07:52,218
[SPEAKER_06]: It was never free.

1779
02:07:52,618 --> 02:07:55,139
[SPEAKER_09]: It was an NCSoft pay game that just never took off.

1780
02:07:55,179 --> 02:07:55,800
[SPEAKER_09]: I played it once.

1781
02:07:56,300 --> 02:07:58,781
[SPEAKER_09]: It was all right, but it was more like a shooter-type game.

1782
02:07:59,341 --> 02:08:00,781
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, that didn't go over so well.

1783
02:08:01,282 --> 02:08:04,923
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, maybe after that whole debacle failed, maybe he's coming back and doing this.

1784
02:08:04,983 --> 02:08:05,343
[SPEAKER_09]: Who knows?

1785
02:08:06,303 --> 02:08:07,303
[SPEAKER_09]: Could be a variety of things.

1786
02:08:07,963 --> 02:08:09,264
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's get to the mailbag.

1787
02:08:09,324 --> 02:08:20,107
[SPEAKER_09]: Every week we invite your emails at mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com And DarkSakura's gonna dive into the email bag headfirst and pull out a couple emails that she thinks are worth sharing with us tonight.

1788
02:08:21,044 --> 02:08:22,165
[SPEAKER_04]: I found some sticky ones.

1789
02:08:40,843 --> 02:08:41,103
[SPEAKER_04]: Robert M.

1790
02:08:57,532 --> 02:08:59,233
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I think you have a right to question those types of emails.

1791
02:08:59,293 --> 02:09:06,038
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly, and also I don't think that they are actually having you agree to those terms of services through that.

1792
02:09:06,218 --> 02:09:08,120
[SPEAKER_10]: I got an email, I think.

1793
02:09:08,260 --> 02:09:10,041
[SPEAKER_10]: I just ignored it because I don't care.

1794
02:09:10,061 --> 02:09:16,886
[SPEAKER_09]: I did get an email, but the minute I went back into the PS3, I played PS3 just a couple days ago, I think after the first, because that's when we were playing Mortal Kombat.

1795
02:09:16,906 --> 02:09:17,567
[SPEAKER_09]: It was Friday, right?

1796
02:09:17,627 --> 02:09:17,747
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1797
02:09:17,987 --> 02:09:20,750
[SPEAKER_09]: and it made me re-accept the turns of service when I signed in.

1798
02:09:21,111 --> 02:09:23,433
[SPEAKER_09]: So that'll all happen through your PlayStation.

1799
02:09:23,874 --> 02:09:25,255
[SPEAKER_09]: So don't do anything with email.

1800
02:09:25,315 --> 02:09:29,620
[SPEAKER_04]: I was watching Supernatural on Friday night and it didn't have me do anything.

1801
02:09:32,085 --> 02:09:33,866
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe you weren't connecting to the interwebs?

1802
02:09:33,946 --> 02:09:34,346
[SPEAKER_09]: IDK.

1803
02:09:35,106 --> 02:09:35,466
[SPEAKER_04]: Might be.

1804
02:09:36,526 --> 02:09:38,227
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, next email.

1805
02:09:40,348 --> 02:09:44,549
[SPEAKER_04]: Note, the following letter has been mirrored posted to the Sims 3 online forums.

1806
02:09:45,089 --> 02:09:49,131
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is also titled, by the way, A Satirical Response to the Dragon Age 2 Protest Letter.

1807
02:09:50,411 --> 02:09:54,373
[SPEAKER_04]: Dear sirs, in the past week I've been playing a lot of the game The Sims 3 on my iPad.

1808
02:09:54,854 --> 02:09:58,076
[SPEAKER_04]: I like most of the game, however there is one element of the game that absolutely offends me.

1809
02:09:58,636 --> 02:10:04,439
[SPEAKER_04]: In the game you can make different meals for yourself and whoever you happen to be living with at the point in the game.

1810
02:10:05,020 --> 02:10:08,482
[SPEAKER_04]: Among the meal options you can choose from is vegetable soup.

1811
02:10:09,022 --> 02:10:10,583
[SPEAKER_04]: This option deeply offends me.

1812
02:10:10,823 --> 02:10:13,144
[SPEAKER_04]: As an ardent carnivore, I eat meat with every meal.

1813
02:10:13,444 --> 02:10:13,745
[SPEAKER_04]: Every!

1814
02:10:14,205 --> 02:10:18,607
[SPEAKER_04]: I eat meat with breakfast, meat with lunch, meat with afternoon snack, meat with dinner, meat with my late night snack.

1815
02:10:19,008 --> 02:10:23,150
[SPEAKER_04]: I eat meat like it's going out of style, which, after going to my local Whole Foods, it just might be.

1816
02:10:23,810 --> 02:10:30,174
[SPEAKER_04]: The option of eating vegetable soup offends me as I feel meat should be not only an option of what to eat at meals, it should be THE option.

1817
02:10:30,914 --> 02:10:31,495
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1818
02:10:49,813 --> 02:10:54,094
[SPEAKER_04]: I will post an online petition that will surely be signed by many of the gamers who identify and agree with me.

1819
02:10:54,575 --> 02:10:55,875
[SPEAKER_04]: Online petitions are no joke.

1820
02:10:56,155 --> 02:10:58,316
[SPEAKER_04]: Think of all the things that have changed because of online petitions.

1821
02:10:58,476 --> 02:10:58,976
[SPEAKER_04]: Think of it.

1822
02:10:59,076 --> 02:11:00,176
[SPEAKER_04]: Yours truly, Red Entertainment.

1823
02:11:00,356 --> 02:11:00,957
[SPEAKER_04]: Satire over.

1824
02:11:01,557 --> 02:11:04,238
[SPEAKER_04]: This message has been brought to you by the tachymeter.

1825
02:11:05,638 --> 02:11:09,819
[SPEAKER_04]: That collection of numbers on the outside of your watch... Oh, tachometer.

1826
02:11:10,620 --> 02:11:15,101
[SPEAKER_04]: That collection of numbers on the outside of your watch that you have no idea what the fuck it's there for.

1827
02:11:15,861 --> 02:11:17,322
[SPEAKER_04]: Tachometers on your car...

1828
02:11:19,008 --> 02:11:20,369
[SPEAKER_04]: To show you your RPMs, right?

1829
02:11:23,191 --> 02:11:25,873
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah, I thought the parody, though, was pretty funny.

1830
02:11:25,953 --> 02:11:27,715
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's pretty right on.

1831
02:11:27,895 --> 02:11:28,295
[SPEAKER_06]: I lulled.

1832
02:11:28,435 --> 02:11:33,479
[SPEAKER_06]: So, what's the name of the guy from Bioware that did that old, the David... David something.

1833
02:11:33,499 --> 02:11:33,900
[SPEAKER_04]: Spader?

1834
02:11:34,420 --> 02:11:35,361
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's an actor.

1835
02:11:35,621 --> 02:11:36,161
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, he's an actor.

1836
02:11:36,181 --> 02:11:37,863
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's David Spade, but it's Gator.

1837
02:11:39,664 --> 02:11:49,954
[SPEAKER_06]: There's an online petition to get him fired because I guess the same-sex options, the NPCs in Dragon Age 2, whether it be the female, what's her name?

1838
02:11:50,194 --> 02:11:50,535
[SPEAKER_06]: Meryl?

1839
02:11:51,936 --> 02:11:53,938
[SPEAKER_04]: The elf girl Meryl, yeah.

1840
02:11:54,321 --> 02:11:56,664
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Meryl will hit on you no matter what gender you are.

1841
02:12:13,664 --> 02:12:19,189
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, but just... And so will, I think it's Varric, the dwarf guy?

1842
02:12:19,709 --> 02:12:24,533
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think they're just set to be attracted to the main person.

1843
02:12:24,773 --> 02:12:35,402
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but I just thought it was funny that he had put out that response to that one idiot guy who wrote in, but there's also just a petition to get him fired because I guess the gay and lesbian characters are horny.

1844
02:12:35,842 --> 02:12:37,923
[SPEAKER_04]: That's butt-tarded.

1845
02:12:38,063 --> 02:12:39,423
[SPEAKER_04]: If anyone's horny, it's Isabella.

1846
02:12:39,703 --> 02:12:40,183
[SPEAKER_09]: I found it.

1847
02:12:41,124 --> 02:12:41,844
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's the petition.

1848
02:12:41,904 --> 02:12:43,604
[SPEAKER_09]: It's on PetitionSpot.com.

1849
02:12:43,684 --> 02:12:45,165
[SPEAKER_09]: Please don't visit it.

1850
02:12:45,185 --> 02:12:47,725
[SPEAKER_09]: It says, Fire David Gator for stereotyping gays.

1851
02:12:48,366 --> 02:12:53,287
[SPEAKER_09]: As a homosexual playing Dragon Age 2, I've witnessed the worst stereotype homosexual characters in this game.

1852
02:12:53,747 --> 02:12:59,529
[SPEAKER_09]: If you refuse to make your moves on a gay character, then you are received rivalry points for not wanting to be gay for the character.

1853
02:13:00,049 --> 02:13:00,990
[SPEAKER_09]: This is completely wrong.

1854
02:13:01,030 --> 02:13:03,491
[SPEAKER_09]: Homosexuals do not approach people and force them to kiss us.

1855
02:13:20,200 --> 02:13:28,971
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the type of garbage that has people believe gays shouldn't serve in the military.

1856
02:13:29,272 --> 02:13:32,235
[SPEAKER_09]: We are human beings that are the same as everyone else.

1857
02:13:32,556 --> 02:13:37,101
[SPEAKER_09]: Please sign this petition if you wish that Dragon Age senior writer David Gator should be fired.

1858
02:13:37,662 --> 02:14:01,188
[SPEAKER_04]: and this is by the user Oakland how about fuck you because get this if okay if all right say we have I'm just gonna use Meryl for example and she's hitting on my female rogue but in the male scenario she hits on the male rogue too and you reject her is that going to make her like you anymore is it gonna make her a little bit upset with you it doesn't matter gender she's still hitting on whoever

1859
02:14:02,759 --> 02:14:13,045
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, so we would like to give a big hearty OLR fuck you to the following people who have signed this petition and posted their names publicly on the internet for us all to see.

1860

[SPEAKER_09]: After all, it was your choice to sign this in a public forum.

[SPEAKER_09]: So we'd like to give a good hearty fuck you to Ryan Cukor, John Holmes,

[SPEAKER_09]: Amy Veers, Anton Sinia, Aiden Woodruff, Benjamin Lee, Alex Diaz, Nikita Belkolpyatov, Harvey Vdarsky, and Luca Patterson.

1865
02:15:33,945 --> 02:15:46,329
[SPEAKER_06]: a hearty fuck you from Orange Lounge Radio I just, I don't know I brought that up to say that that Sims parody letter is awesome and that you can't please everybody or someone will always have a problem with what you're doing.

1866
02:15:46,429 --> 02:15:48,750
[SPEAKER_04]: This is people looking for drama where there is none.

1867
02:15:49,310 --> 02:15:53,412
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like what is so boring in your life that you have to make drama to be upset about?

1868
02:15:54,392 --> 02:15:54,972
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously?

1869
02:15:55,413 --> 02:15:56,353
[SPEAKER_04]: The world is not about you.

1870
02:15:56,983 --> 02:16:00,745
[SPEAKER_09]: My favorite, though, is that there are totally people trolling that, like half of the signatures are trolls.

1871
02:16:00,765 --> 02:16:03,407
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there was one that I wanted you to read, but it was obviously a troll one.

1872
02:16:03,427 --> 02:16:03,687
[SPEAKER_06]: What was that?

1873
02:16:03,707 --> 02:16:08,170
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like some gay dude that wants to get boned every day or something.

1874
02:16:08,190 --> 02:16:09,471
[SPEAKER_06]: It was, I don't know, funny.

1875
02:16:11,172 --> 02:16:11,512
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

1876
02:16:11,532 --> 02:16:13,333
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, ready for the next?

1877
02:16:13,753 --> 02:16:13,973
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1878
02:16:14,634 --> 02:16:15,534
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, OLR.

1879
02:16:15,594 --> 02:16:20,457
[SPEAKER_04]: First off, I want to let you know that I'm typing this on my iPhone, so if there are any weird words, it's probably autocorrect.

1880
02:16:21,438 --> 02:16:22,218
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1881
02:16:23,659 --> 02:16:37,004
[SPEAKER_04]: A while ago I emailed asking if either the OLR crew or anyone in the chat room knew of any video game characters who wear knitted clothing, like Riku Scarf in Final Fantasy X-2 or Nora S. Thyme's sweater in Final Fantasy XIII.

1882
02:16:37,764 --> 02:16:40,445
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm still looking for suggestions, but I found another character.

1883
02:16:40,985 --> 02:16:43,746
[SPEAKER_04]: Final Fantasy III's Lunath, some purple sweater under his jacket.

1884
02:16:44,247 --> 02:16:44,687
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.

1885
02:16:45,447 --> 02:16:48,089
[SPEAKER_04]: Sky requested that I send some pics of past projects.

1886
02:16:48,149 --> 02:16:49,750
[SPEAKER_04]: I've included some of my past works.

1887
02:16:50,191 --> 02:16:55,434
[SPEAKER_04]: The gray afghan I'm working on now and that green scarf also doubled as a shawl for this petite model.

1888
02:16:56,295 --> 02:17:00,718
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking forward for suggestions on video game characters knitted attire, so let me know.

1889
02:17:00,758 --> 02:17:01,979
[SPEAKER_04]: You should totally knit me stuff.

1890
02:17:02,840 --> 02:17:03,961
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you knit a Mobius scarf?

1891
02:17:04,761 --> 02:17:05,522
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I totally want one.

1892
02:17:05,662 --> 02:17:11,766
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, on a completely random note, the other night I had a really screwed up dream where the three OLR hosts were included.

1893
02:17:11,886 --> 02:17:13,508
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I don't know if I'm afraid.

1894
02:17:13,528 --> 02:17:13,928
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway,

1895
02:17:14,148 --> 02:17:31,901
[SPEAKER_04]: for some reason we were in some Everglades slash Marsh looking place and me and DarkSakura were in one dune buggy and Loki and Skye were in another following us a building to our left exploded like a balloon filled with water as we drove by it for some reason they veered off the path and were following a higher path that swerved in and out of the main that we were on

1896
02:17:33,302 --> 02:17:35,744
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't eat before you go to bed Don't eat before you go to bed

1897
02:18:04,426 --> 02:18:33,229
[SPEAKER_09]: make you dream weird shit or don't sleep with NyQuil tonight on the Orange Lounge Radio knitting and crocheting video game show we're going to talk about how to knit a nice little scarf I think this stuff is kind of neat actually where they're taking this one step further into the whole making tangible goods from video game inspired stuff and I know DarkSakura you're really into this

1898
02:18:34,291 --> 02:18:50,679
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm surprised there aren't more people that kind of like crochet the whole like 8-bit patterns using the old sprite graphics to like make those what are those things the needle point or whatever this is gonna be a bray yeah but I'm talking about like can't you like stitch a like sprite into those

1899
02:18:52,314 --> 02:19:19,517
[SPEAKER_06]: you theoretically could on a crocheted item you just need the grid but Becky does needlepoint and then there's cross stitch I think in a recent issue of the official World of Warcraft magazine they feature a fan who does handmade plushies that are very intricate and exquisitely done she's not allowed to sell them but because they're so good they gave her a pictorial in the magazine so she makes like moonkin plushies and

1900
02:19:21,319 --> 02:19:24,242
[SPEAKER_04]: I want a walrus person, whatever they're called.

1901
02:19:26,365 --> 02:19:26,925
[SPEAKER_04]: I want them.

1902
02:19:27,446 --> 02:19:28,347
[SPEAKER_04]: These should be playable.

1903
02:19:29,148 --> 02:19:29,709
[SPEAKER_09]: You never know.

1904
02:19:31,591 --> 02:19:32,252
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see the pictures.

1905
02:19:33,233 --> 02:19:34,094
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I closed it.

1906
02:19:34,174 --> 02:19:34,614
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on.

1907
02:19:35,115 --> 02:19:35,515
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on!

1908
02:19:37,270 --> 02:19:37,590
[SPEAKER_09]: Check this out.

1909
02:19:37,610 --> 02:19:38,031
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

1910
02:19:38,051 --> 02:19:38,611
[SPEAKER_09]: There's one picture?

1911
02:19:38,631 --> 02:19:38,792
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, wow.

1912
02:20:02,566 --> 02:20:03,166
[SPEAKER_04]: Very intricate.

1913
02:20:03,406 --> 02:20:04,207
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, very intricate.

1914
02:20:04,847 --> 02:20:06,568
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't nip for shit, but I can sure croquet.

1915
02:20:06,708 --> 02:20:07,288
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, you rhymed.

1916
02:20:09,069 --> 02:20:10,050
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, sheep!

1917
02:20:11,430 --> 02:20:12,331
[SPEAKER_04]: That's so cute.

1918
02:20:14,952 --> 02:20:16,453
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, it has little numbers on the sheep.

1919
02:20:16,493 --> 02:20:16,913
[SPEAKER_09]: That's cute.

1920
02:20:16,933 --> 02:20:17,834
[SPEAKER_04]: They're counting sheep.

1921
02:20:18,074 --> 02:20:18,574
[SPEAKER_09]: I get it.

1922
02:20:19,855 --> 02:20:21,716
[SPEAKER_04]: And it is just so fantastic radio, huh?

1923
02:20:21,756 --> 02:20:22,896
[SPEAKER_09]: It's amazing radio.

1924
02:20:22,996 --> 02:20:24,537
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's look at some pictures together, guys.

1925
02:20:24,557 --> 02:20:25,558
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a scarf.

1926
02:20:27,238 --> 02:20:28,319
[SPEAKER_04]: And a pretty lady wearing it.

1927
02:20:30,097 --> 02:20:33,039
[SPEAKER_04]: My chair's decided that it doesn't want to stay up anymore.

1928
02:20:34,100 --> 02:20:35,160
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, this is like his model.

1929
02:20:35,501 --> 02:20:35,761
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1930
02:20:35,961 --> 02:20:36,421
[SPEAKER_09]: Look at that.

1931
02:20:39,083 --> 02:20:40,464
[SPEAKER_09]: She kind of looks like she's been crying, though.

1932
02:20:40,504 --> 02:20:41,004
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't be sad.

1933
02:20:41,024 --> 02:20:41,565
[SPEAKER_09]: You're wearing pretty stars.

1934
02:20:41,585 --> 02:20:42,945
[SPEAKER_04]: That's red eye from the camera, Rob.

1935
02:20:44,026 --> 02:20:45,227
[SPEAKER_09]: From back here, it looks like crying.

1936
02:20:45,247 --> 02:20:45,927
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, don't be crying.

1937
02:20:45,947 --> 02:20:46,548
[SPEAKER_09]: You're wearing pretty stars.

1938
02:20:46,568 --> 02:20:47,308
[SPEAKER_04]: It needs color correction.

1939
02:20:48,289 --> 02:20:48,969
[SPEAKER_09]: She better be crying.

1940
02:20:48,989 --> 02:20:49,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Photoshop, please.

1941
02:20:50,791 --> 02:20:51,091
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1942
02:20:51,391 --> 02:20:51,891
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's move on.

1943
02:20:51,931 --> 02:20:54,193
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a terrible video where we're looking at pictures.

1944
02:20:54,213 --> 02:20:54,853
[SPEAKER_04]: That's actually cool.

1945
02:20:54,893 --> 02:20:55,814
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of like a houndstooth.

1946
02:20:58,255 --> 02:20:58,476
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1947
02:20:58,496 --> 02:20:58,916
[SPEAKER_04]: Last email.

1948
02:21:01,323 --> 02:21:02,023
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, OLR.

1949
02:21:02,083 --> 02:21:06,406
[SPEAKER_04]: Seeing as the mailbag has been rather light as of late, I thought I'd send an email for the upcoming show.

1950
02:21:06,926 --> 02:21:10,649
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to touch on a few subjects, but I'll try to keep this email from going on too long.

1951
02:21:10,929 --> 02:21:11,569
[SPEAKER_04]: You failed.

1952
02:21:11,890 --> 02:21:14,651
[SPEAKER_09]: I was going to say, I see a wall of words from back here.

1953
02:21:17,031 --> 02:21:19,312
[SPEAKER_09]: Wall of Words crits you for 9,000 hit points.

1954
02:21:21,393 --> 02:21:28,197
[SPEAKER_04]: First off, as of the time I typed this on Thursday afternoon, there's no notable free videos on the PSN Video Store.

1955
02:21:28,797 --> 02:21:33,800
[SPEAKER_04]: If something were to be added between now and when the OLR airs, we're the OLR now.

1956
02:21:34,540 --> 02:21:37,323
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll mention it either in chat or via Twitter topics.

1957
02:21:37,843 --> 02:21:58,881
[SPEAKER_04]: Although there's nothing good that's free so far, I should mention the PSN Video Store does have a petty decent sale going on for the outright purchase of SD versions of miscellaneous comedy movies such as Airplane, Disaster Movie, Joe Dirt, RV, Team America, several MST3K titles, etc.,

1958
02:21:59,842 --> 02:22:07,729
[SPEAKER_04]: as well as three stand-up comedy specials and select seasons of Super Jail, Aqua Teen Hunger Force, and the anime series called Dururara?

1959
02:22:08,330 --> 02:22:09,231
[SPEAKER_04]: The Complete Series.

1960
02:22:09,551 --> 02:22:10,031
[SPEAKER_09]: Excuse you.

1961
02:22:10,572 --> 02:22:10,732
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1962
02:22:11,453 --> 02:22:17,178
[SPEAKER_04]: The movies and stand-up specials are normally $10 while the other stuff is normally $2 but during the sale they're half

1963
02:22:20,299 --> 02:22:40,229
[SPEAKER_04]: on the subject of video stores I've noticed that the XBL slash Zune video marketplace has been updated to include a new tab specifically for free TV shows, sneak previews, etc this should be very helpful that stuff has been grouped together in one place rather than having to hunt around for it at all

1964
02:22:41,810 --> 02:22:47,293
[SPEAKER_04]: Lastly, I want to touch on the PS3 version of Free Realms, which has been released via PSN this past Tuesday.

1965
02:22:47,694 --> 02:22:54,458
[SPEAKER_04]: Although I haven't put enough time into it to give a full, fair review of it, I at least would like to give my early impressions of it, which are mixed.

1966
02:22:55,138 --> 02:22:59,101
[SPEAKER_04]: Frankly, there's a few, a couple things hurting it.

1967
02:22:59,201 --> 02:23:00,182
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it a few or a couple?

1968
02:23:29,793 --> 02:23:39,362
[SPEAKER_04]: In terms of the game's overall appearance, it can best be described as if Mr. Rogers had made a stew out of Barney, the Teletubbies, most Nickelodeon cartoons, and the Power Rangers.

1969
02:23:39,843 --> 02:23:44,127
[SPEAKER_04]: Eight said stew, then vomited all over Unicorn, a bunny-infested world of Warcraft.

1970
02:23:44,147 --> 02:23:45,248
[SPEAKER_09]: That's about right.

1971
02:23:45,508 --> 02:23:49,191
[SPEAKER_04]: Whether this is a positive or negative is purely subjective and personal preference.

1972
02:23:49,932 --> 02:23:51,773
[SPEAKER_04]: This email has been brought to you by NyQuil.

1973
02:23:51,813 --> 02:23:59,599
[SPEAKER_04]: Capital N, small y, big fucking Q. NyQuil, NyQuil, NyQuil, we love you, you giant fucking Q. See, DarkSakura, I can quote Dennis Leary too.

1974
02:24:01,740 --> 02:24:02,041
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it.

1975
02:24:03,382 --> 02:24:07,124
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I guess somebody kind of agrees with me on Free Realms.

1976
02:24:09,526 --> 02:24:15,510
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a horrible piece of crap game that makes no sense, that you have no idea what to do.

1977
02:24:15,590 --> 02:24:16,691
[SPEAKER_09]: Not that there's anything wrong with that.

1978
02:24:17,312 --> 02:24:17,772
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I'm kidding.

1979
02:24:18,248 --> 02:24:19,849
[SPEAKER_04]: I call it the sphincter of MMOs.

1980
02:24:19,889 --> 02:24:23,111
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not the worst game I've ever played, but it's just not good.

1981
02:24:23,171 --> 02:24:24,292
[SPEAKER_04]: The sphincter of MMOs.

1982
02:24:24,652 --> 02:24:25,833
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not the crap that comes out.

1983
02:24:25,853 --> 02:24:29,675
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if it's the sphincter, but it's definitely like the upper intestine.

1984
02:24:31,176 --> 02:24:36,439
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, my reason for saying the sphincter is because it's not the crap, it's just where the crap comes from.

1985
02:24:37,159 --> 02:24:37,439
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1986
02:24:38,300 --> 02:24:38,680
[SPEAKER_09]: You win.

1987
02:24:40,101 --> 02:24:43,603
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's get angsty and do some angry, raw FUs of the week.

1988
02:25:00,442 --> 02:25:06,966
[SPEAKER_04]: My FU goes towards the repaving of the sidewalk, the street outside of my house.

1989
02:25:07,426 --> 02:25:14,730
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they're closing the street tomorrow and Tuesday from, I want to say, 7 in the morning until 5 in the afternoon.

1990
02:25:15,670 --> 02:25:42,778
[SPEAKER_04]: and I really shouldn't have to leave my house until like 9 to get to school because I'm making up time at school and instead I have to park my house a block away at my friend's house so that I can walk to my car in the morning and then go to school which is not that far, I'm not complaining about walking but I complain about walking that I shouldn't have to do they should do this like at night with sound mufflers around them

1991
02:25:44,983 --> 02:25:46,703
[SPEAKER_04]: or they should give us money to be in communities.

1992
02:25:47,024 --> 02:25:48,764
[SPEAKER_04]: But I guess we're getting anywhere without an exploit.

1993
02:25:49,204 --> 02:25:49,764
[SPEAKER_07]: Money rocks.

1994
02:25:51,945 --> 02:25:52,225
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki!

1995
02:25:54,345 --> 02:25:57,406
[SPEAKER_10]: Um... I don't know, there's not a whole lot that I'm really mad about.

1996
02:25:57,466 --> 02:26:01,427
[SPEAKER_10]: Just, I guess, F you to lack of sleep because I haven't been getting a lot of sleep.

1997
02:26:02,147 --> 02:26:11,390
[SPEAKER_10]: I have to wake up way early in the morning and, you know, one or two days isn't bad but doing it for eight months straight now takes a toll on you.

1998
02:26:11,410 --> 02:26:12,570
[SPEAKER_10]: It makes you go a little crazy!

1999
02:26:14,358 --> 02:26:15,739
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, you were already crazy, Loki.

2000
02:26:16,559 --> 02:26:18,901
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, and just compounded on top of that.

2001
02:26:20,162 --> 02:26:21,523
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I don't know.

2002
02:26:21,603 --> 02:26:22,803
[SPEAKER_09]: Things have been pretty good for me.

2003
02:26:22,823 --> 02:26:24,825
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't really have a lot to say F you to do.

2004
02:26:25,245 --> 02:26:25,465
[SPEAKER_07]: Ants.

2005
02:26:26,126 --> 02:26:27,046
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, F you to ants.

2006
02:26:27,506 --> 02:26:28,547
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, little bastards.

2007
02:26:28,867 --> 02:26:29,288
[SPEAKER_09]: I hate them.

2008
02:26:29,708 --> 02:26:30,288
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a good one.

2009
02:26:30,328 --> 02:26:30,688
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

2010
02:26:30,949 --> 02:26:31,449
[SPEAKER_09]: Slash spot.

2011
02:26:31,469 --> 02:26:31,809
[SPEAKER_09]: How about you?

2012
02:26:33,110 --> 02:26:37,533
[SPEAKER_06]: Even if it's for really good reasons, like a new job or, you know...

2013
02:26:40,095 --> 02:27:03,998
[SPEAKER_06]: a new beginning or whatever the process of moving as an adult is one of the most annoying bullshitty things a grown person can do to themselves you've got to change your address get the stupid postal card pack up everything you own get friends to help you move even if it's awesome and nothing goes wrong moving is bullshit there you go

2014
02:27:05,583 --> 02:27:06,523
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving is hard.

2015
02:27:06,963 --> 02:27:07,784
[SPEAKER_09]: It's for grown-ups.

2016
02:27:08,584 --> 02:27:09,184
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it stinks.

2017
02:27:09,204 --> 02:27:09,744
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't like it.

2018
02:27:10,244 --> 02:27:10,504
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2019
02:27:11,465 --> 02:27:13,185
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, that's it for the FUs of the week.

2020
02:27:13,425 --> 02:27:18,067
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's move on to a couple more stories and then your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2021
02:27:19,187 --> 02:27:24,969
[SPEAKER_10]: As if we didn't need more reasons to believe that there's going to be a new Grand Theft Auto announced at E3.

2022
02:27:26,849 --> 02:27:32,251
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, there's been a casting call for people to do some character...

2023
02:27:33,315 --> 02:27:53,070
[SPEAKER_10]: voiceover work and one of those characters happens to be from the Grand Theft Auto universe including the guy's name is James Pattison and he was a guest aside character at least in San Andreas where he openly recounted acts of pedophilia and

2024
02:27:53,791 --> 02:28:01,147
[SPEAKER_10]: and in Grand Theft Auto 4 he was arrested by the Indonesian police after being suspected of child molestation in Bali.

2025
02:28:02,289 --> 02:28:02,690
[SPEAKER_10]: So...

2026
02:28:03,965 --> 02:28:08,628
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, apparently he's coming back in the next game, and someone's going to be doing the voice for him.

2027
02:28:09,909 --> 02:28:13,150
[SPEAKER_10]: Some other characters they name as well, they're pretty generic sounding.

2028
02:28:13,671 --> 02:28:20,095
[SPEAKER_10]: Samantha, a young female obsessed with sex parties, always dreaming of being a Hollywood celebrity.

2029
02:28:21,495 --> 02:28:22,816
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, let's see here...

2030
02:28:27,762 --> 02:28:28,082
[SPEAKER_10]: What else?

2031
02:28:28,282 --> 02:28:31,605
[SPEAKER_10]: There were some other characters I thought they were talking about too as well.

2032
02:28:31,625 --> 02:28:32,926
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of weird stuff.

2033
02:28:35,868 --> 02:28:37,849
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, so probably new game coming out.

2034
02:28:38,169 --> 02:28:39,711
[SPEAKER_10]: I would not be surprised next year.

2035
02:28:41,952 --> 02:28:42,493
[SPEAKER_10]: Exciting!

2036
02:28:42,613 --> 02:28:43,073
[SPEAKER_10]: I love it!

2037
02:28:44,194 --> 02:28:48,297
[SPEAKER_10]: And the rumor is that it's supposed to be going back to Los Santos, which was from San Andreas.

2038
02:28:48,877 --> 02:28:50,959
[SPEAKER_10]: Probably one of the best Grand Theft Auto games ever.

2039
02:28:50,979 --> 02:28:51,199
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

2040
02:28:52,259 --> 02:28:54,680
[SPEAKER_09]: I think a new Grand Theft Auto game is kind of a given.

2041
02:28:54,760 --> 02:28:59,061
[SPEAKER_06]: San Andreas was an analog of LA in that game.

2042
02:28:59,601 --> 02:29:01,682
[SPEAKER_06]: Was Los Santos Las Vegas or no?

2043
02:29:01,822 --> 02:29:06,584
[SPEAKER_10]: No, Los Santos was part of San Andreas because there's three cities in San Andreas.

2044
02:29:06,644 --> 02:29:10,945
[SPEAKER_10]: It was Los Santos, San Friera, and Las Venturas.

2045
02:29:11,105 --> 02:29:14,046
[SPEAKER_10]: Las Venturas was the analog of San Francisco.

2046
02:29:14,086 --> 02:29:16,527
[SPEAKER_10]: Vegas, San Francisco, and Los Angeles.

2047
02:29:18,687 --> 02:29:20,208
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, but that game was massive.

2048
02:29:20,228 --> 02:29:20,608
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just

2049
02:29:21,551 --> 02:29:22,052
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

2050
02:29:40,167 --> 02:30:00,943
[SPEAKER_10]: I've got the old hot coffee disc from the Playstation 2 and my sister's been borrowing it forever even though she doesn't need to because there's a rip on the hard drive of that Playstation 2 that she has so I just need to get back and play it on my generation 1 Playstation 3 full backwards compatibility oh yeah

2051
02:30:02,714 --> 02:30:11,816
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, well, one more story for you guys before we get to the phone calls, and this is about a man named Phil Fish, and you might not know that game, or you might not know that name, but he is making the game Fez.

2052
02:30:12,196 --> 02:30:19,617
[SPEAKER_09]: It's an indie game, and it's going to be coming out on Xbox Live Arcade, possibly the PC and the PlayStation 3, but probably not the Wii.

2053
02:30:20,297 --> 02:30:28,039
[SPEAKER_09]: In an interview with Destructoid, he was quoted saying, quote, "...right now we're only concentrating on XBLA, which makes the most sense for us at the time."

2054
02:30:28,419 --> 02:30:33,821
[SPEAKER_09]: PC and PlayStation Network would also make a lot of sense, but in my opinion, WiiWare just wouldn't be worth our time and effort.

2055
02:30:34,181 --> 02:30:37,902
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a dismal system that I don't want to deal with, neither as a customer nor a developer.

2056
02:30:38,102 --> 02:30:38,662
[SPEAKER_09]: No demos?

2057
02:30:38,962 --> 02:30:39,482
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck off.

2058
02:30:40,162 --> 02:30:42,003
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's a quote from this guy.

2059
02:30:42,043 --> 02:30:44,984
[SPEAKER_09]: So he basically told the WiiWare system it can go, you know, fuck off.

2060
02:30:46,205 --> 02:30:50,908
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, granted, this guy, I don't want to say he's a nobody, but his game hasn't really been proven yet.

2061
02:30:51,028 --> 02:30:55,252
[SPEAKER_09]: He's one of those garage developers that Nintendo kind of doesn't want in their house anyway.

2062
02:30:56,252 --> 02:31:06,780
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't know if this story carries a lot of weight, but, I mean, the guy did kind of have the balls to call out Nintendo, but I kind of think it's not going to really change a goddamn thing in the scope of things.

2063
02:31:07,361 --> 02:31:08,402
[SPEAKER_09]: But he really does have a point.

2064
02:31:08,602 --> 02:31:11,244
[SPEAKER_09]: Why do people keep developing for WiiWare when it's kind of shit?

2065
02:31:12,304 --> 02:31:12,784
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

2066
02:31:13,425 --> 02:31:29,817
[SPEAKER_10]: And as I posted on Twitter earlier this week, remember Nintendo was commenting on how they wanted to make sure they kept the garage developers out because in order to make sure that there's quality products coming out on WiiWare and DSiWare and stuff like that.

2067
02:31:30,397 --> 02:31:32,218
[SPEAKER_10]: Guess what came out on DSiWare this week?

2068
02:31:32,778 --> 02:31:38,839
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a program to take pictures of your friends and put them in funny Halloween-themed backgrounds.

2069
02:31:39,240 --> 02:31:39,940
[SPEAKER_10]: It looked like shit.

2070
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:41,420
[SPEAKER_10]: It looked like something that was on the iOS platform.

2071
02:31:41,480 --> 02:31:42,861
[SPEAKER_09]: Yay, clip art!

2072
02:31:43,201 --> 02:31:44,881
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, Halloween-themed?

2073
02:31:45,041 --> 02:31:48,242
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, like monster-themed stuff.

2074
02:31:49,362 --> 02:31:51,643
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, the best one on the iPhone was that hair one.

2075
02:31:52,501 --> 02:31:53,622
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah, that was funny.

2076
02:31:54,503 --> 02:31:57,426
[SPEAKER_09]: And the Make Your Friends Fat application is funny, too.

2077
02:31:57,446 --> 02:31:58,026
[SPEAKER_04]: And the Unicorn.

2078
02:31:58,667 --> 02:31:59,968
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it was absolutely terrible.

2079
02:32:00,108 --> 02:32:06,434
[SPEAKER_10]: And perfect week to come out, right after I just said, or right after they said, oh, we need to make sure quality's on there.

2080
02:32:06,734 --> 02:32:09,157
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's some quality shit right there.

2081
02:32:09,277 --> 02:32:12,019
[SPEAKER_10]: You're so much better than the iOS platform.

2082
02:32:12,099 --> 02:32:18,065
[SPEAKER_10]: What was I thinking, even contemplating that you would ever allow something that terrible to be on your network?

2083
02:32:18,985 --> 02:32:21,887
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, Nintendo, you don't need these garage developers at all.

2084
02:32:21,907 --> 02:32:24,208
[SPEAKER_10]: You got your Mario games that you're recaching putting out.

2085
02:32:24,668 --> 02:32:26,029
[SPEAKER_10]: So, whatever, that's fine.

2086
02:32:26,049 --> 02:32:29,211
[SPEAKER_10]: They're better off, you know, not going to the WiiWare service.

2087
02:32:29,537 --> 02:32:30,898
[SPEAKER_10]: But seriously, I mean, come on.

2088
02:32:31,318 --> 02:32:31,819
[SPEAKER_10]: Demos.

2089
02:32:32,079 --> 02:32:34,441
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, demos have been around for fucking years now.

2090
02:32:34,461 --> 02:32:37,063
[SPEAKER_10]: And you can't implement demos on your WiiWare service.

2091
02:32:37,363 --> 02:32:40,085
[SPEAKER_10]: Or you just don't want to because a lot of the shit's crap on there.

2092
02:32:40,205 --> 02:32:42,907
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's just terrible games.

2093
02:32:42,967 --> 02:32:45,069
[SPEAKER_10]: And, oh, haha, you downloaded it too late.

2094
02:32:45,949 --> 02:32:47,631
[SPEAKER_10]: Nintendo just kind of doesn't get online.

2095
02:32:47,671 --> 02:32:49,692
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's the same story every week.

2096
02:32:49,752 --> 02:32:51,293
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, they don't get online.

2097
02:32:51,714 --> 02:32:54,536
[SPEAKER_10]: And they don't have any demos for Wii games.

2098
02:32:54,616 --> 02:32:56,117
[SPEAKER_10]: They don't have any demos for any...

2099
02:32:56,637 --> 02:33:00,639
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, they had demos one time for a select few WiiWare games, so it is possible.

2100
02:33:02,140 --> 02:33:03,920
[SPEAKER_10]: Fuck it, we don't give a shit.

2101
02:33:04,200 --> 02:33:05,421
[SPEAKER_10]: Our customers don't need demos.

2102
02:33:05,681 --> 02:33:07,162
[SPEAKER_10]: Our quality speaks for itself.

2103
02:33:07,222 --> 02:33:08,162
[SPEAKER_10]: It should be a no-brainer.

2104
02:33:08,302 --> 02:33:09,703
[SPEAKER_10]: I must buy everything, Nintendo.

2105
02:33:11,924 --> 02:33:39,359
[SPEAKER_06]: the developers of Super Meat Boy which I think is one of the most successful indie games since Braid really the two studios that were most willing to work with them was XBLA and Steam Sony wasn't really interested in the game and when they wanted to put out a WiiWare edition of Super Meat Boy they were fine with the no demo thing but just the restrictions they had to put on the game really crippled it they just cancelled the whole thing because the WiiWare platform and how big the game has to be was shitty

2106
02:33:39,719 --> 02:33:44,662
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, this is a company that thinks that users can't understand megabytes.

2107
02:33:44,842 --> 02:33:48,044
[SPEAKER_10]: They have to put it down to blocks.

2108
02:33:48,464 --> 02:33:52,787
[SPEAKER_10]: Really, how is 5 megabytes and 5 blocks any fucking different?

2109
02:33:52,827 --> 02:33:59,331
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, other than being really confusing to the fact that how many... When you have 64 and you take away 2...

2110
02:34:00,191 --> 02:34:00,771
[SPEAKER_09]: You're left with 62.

2111
02:34:01,232 --> 02:34:08,456
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but then you have to figure out, okay, I have a 2 gigabyte memory card that's in my 3DS or in my Wii system.

2112
02:34:08,676 --> 02:34:10,256
[SPEAKER_10]: How many fucking blocks is that?

2113
02:34:12,218 --> 02:34:12,738
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

2114
02:34:13,538 --> 02:34:14,019
[SPEAKER_10]: No one knows.

2115
02:34:14,039 --> 02:34:15,499
[SPEAKER_09]: Is the 3DS still speaking blocks?

2116
02:34:15,519 --> 02:34:16,020
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, it does.

2117
02:34:16,140 --> 02:34:16,600
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, God.

2118
02:34:18,516 --> 02:34:19,256
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, it does.

2119
02:34:19,517 --> 02:34:22,098
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, come on, man.

2120
02:34:22,738 --> 02:34:24,459
[SPEAKER_10]: Everybody's using computers nowadays.

2121
02:34:26,060 --> 02:34:28,981
[SPEAKER_10]: The term megabyte's been around forever.

2122
02:34:29,161 --> 02:34:31,843
[SPEAKER_06]: Even if they don't, they have an 8 gig iPod.

2123
02:34:31,983 --> 02:34:33,163
[SPEAKER_06]: They know what 8 gig means.

2124
02:34:34,124 --> 02:34:35,705
[SPEAKER_06]: The terminology is everywhere now.

2125
02:34:36,305 --> 02:34:40,267
[SPEAKER_10]: And even still, though, why is it so hard to, you know, megabyte?

2126
02:34:40,367 --> 02:34:46,170
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, well, I don't know what a megabyte is, but I know that I have this many on this memory card.

2127
02:34:47,494 --> 02:34:48,415
[SPEAKER_10]: How is that difficult?

2128
02:34:49,076 --> 02:34:49,496
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not.

2129
02:34:49,736 --> 02:34:50,437
[SPEAKER_10]: It really isn't.

2130
02:34:50,537 --> 02:34:54,580
[SPEAKER_10]: But for whatever reason, they decided, let's go ahead and do that again.

2131
02:34:55,001 --> 02:35:01,146
[SPEAKER_10]: Just like they make a lot of poor decisions when it comes to different software and features that they have on these systems.

2132
02:35:01,506 --> 02:35:01,826
[SPEAKER_10]: Whatever.

2133
02:35:01,866 --> 02:35:02,667
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what, Nintendo?

2134
02:35:02,707 --> 02:35:08,652
[SPEAKER_10]: You can play this game as long as you want, and your system will be successful for a while, and eventually you're going to hit that slump again.

2135
02:35:08,672 --> 02:35:10,173
[SPEAKER_04]: They mark it to grandmother's.

2136
02:35:11,193 --> 02:35:17,317
[SPEAKER_10]: You're going to hit that slump again, and then you're going to be in fucking last place, and all that shit, now you've got to catch up again.

2137
02:35:18,177 --> 02:35:21,559
[SPEAKER_10]: So ride the wave while you can, but eventually it's going to come crashing down.

2138
02:35:23,480 --> 02:35:23,900
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2139
02:35:24,521 --> 02:35:26,322
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, let's get to the Skype line.

2140
02:35:26,342 --> 02:35:28,303
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to open that on up.

2141
02:35:28,323 --> 02:35:31,845
[SPEAKER_09]: 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2142
02:35:31,905 --> 02:35:32,525
[SPEAKER_09]: Give us a call.

2143
02:35:33,063 --> 02:35:34,384
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2144
02:35:58,081 --> 02:36:07,648
[SPEAKER_10]: Sony wants access to all those people's hard drives that filed for the other OS lawsuits because they're saying they may be part of a bigger hacker conspiracy.

2145
02:36:08,028 --> 02:36:08,409
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

2146
02:36:08,609 --> 02:36:13,652
[SPEAKER_10]: So basically they're saying everybody that wanted Linux on their system, they're a hacker and they're out to destroy Sony.

2147
02:36:13,692 --> 02:36:15,414
[SPEAKER_10]: Wasn't the government using it?

2148
02:36:15,634 --> 02:36:17,735
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah, but they're hackers and they're out to destroy Sony.

2149
02:36:18,296 --> 02:36:22,359
[SPEAKER_10]: Why put that in your system if you think that everybody's hackers out to destroy Sony?

2150
02:36:23,797 --> 02:36:28,781
[SPEAKER_09]: If Sony made the goddamn system, why don't they just make some program that lets them see what's in the system?

2151
02:36:28,821 --> 02:36:31,363
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure they could do that remotely, like a whole Skynet thing.

2152
02:36:31,403 --> 02:36:32,204
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just terrible.

2153
02:36:32,284 --> 02:36:33,044
[SPEAKER_10]: But here's the thing.

2154
02:36:33,185 --> 02:36:46,095
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, well, if you think about it, though, if they made some sort of program and they had it where you connected online to see that kind of stuff, that would update their system and they would be unable to have the other OS in there because you can't update your system anymore if you want to keep that.

2155
02:36:47,356 --> 02:36:47,556
[SPEAKER_10]: But...

2156
02:36:48,837 --> 02:36:53,021
[SPEAKER_10]: The real... Well, one reason they wanted to see the hard drives is to make sure that they actually did have other OS on.

2157
02:36:53,061 --> 02:36:55,504
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is their PlayStation 3 hard drives, not their PCs.

2158
02:36:56,465 --> 02:36:58,507
[SPEAKER_10]: They wanted to make sure they had other OS on there.

2159
02:36:58,627 --> 02:37:04,073
[SPEAKER_10]: But at the same time, though, and the judge doesn't understand, is when you put other OS on there, it's now a computer.

2160
02:37:04,453 --> 02:37:11,380
[SPEAKER_10]: And you need to go through the protocols for discovery for that kind of stuff where you have to have a third-party company look at the stuff.

2161
02:37:11,460 --> 02:37:12,161
[SPEAKER_10]: Not Sony...

2162
02:37:12,622 --> 02:37:19,699
[SPEAKER_10]: Going through and having full access to your hard drive of your now computer Alright, let's go to the phones Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

2163
02:37:20,342 --> 02:37:21,063
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, it's Ranma.

2164
02:37:21,083 --> 02:37:21,763
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up, everyone?

2165
02:37:46,287 --> 02:37:51,629
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing much, just trying to recover for a sleepy Sunday night listening to your show.

2166
02:37:52,449 --> 02:38:00,211
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, just going on the debate of how Nintendo's basically... They're basically regressive at this point.

2167
02:38:00,671 --> 02:38:06,753
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they're pissing off devs to... And it goes back to how much pride they have.

2168
02:38:06,833 --> 02:38:09,654
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember how they covertly...

2169
02:38:11,303 --> 02:38:14,049
[SPEAKER_00]: Dist, you know, the developers of Angry Birds.

2170
02:38:14,169 --> 02:38:15,051
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I remember that.

2171
02:38:15,152 --> 02:38:20,784
[SPEAKER_00]: The CEO actually, like, he actually, you know, he didn't mention it in name, but he actually mentioned them.

2172
02:38:21,826 --> 02:38:25,747
[SPEAKER_00]: and, you know, within that same aspect that they're just, like, bringing down the wages.

2173
02:38:25,867 --> 02:38:36,450
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of like, you know, it's kind of like those, uh, you ever seen that episode of South Park where the, you know, the Goobax episode, and you see the guy shouting, they took our jobs.

2174
02:38:36,850 --> 02:38:37,930
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty much like that.

2175
02:38:37,970 --> 02:38:49,814
[SPEAKER_00]: They're complaining about how, just because it's a zero-sum game, well, to them it appears to be a zero-sum game, that it's just like, it's not worth, it doesn't pay to be a developer anymore.

2176
02:38:50,314 --> 02:38:50,934
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the other...

2177
02:38:51,647 --> 02:38:51,947
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura

2178
02:39:12,588 --> 02:39:15,230
[SPEAKER_00]: You would see that it's a pretty big number.

2179
02:39:15,450 --> 02:39:16,171
[SPEAKER_00]: Even myself.

2180
02:39:16,511 --> 02:39:21,515
[SPEAKER_09]: Think of the shit tons they're making not just off the game itself, but all the licensed tie-ins now.

2181
02:39:21,695 --> 02:39:22,596
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.

2182
02:39:22,636 --> 02:39:23,036
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about it.

2183
02:39:23,056 --> 02:39:26,939
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a free version on the Android market that runs on ads alone.

2184
02:39:26,979 --> 02:39:31,923
[SPEAKER_00]: How many impressions are that through AdSense?

2185
02:39:31,963 --> 02:39:33,924
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot.

2186
02:39:34,305 --> 02:39:41,250
[SPEAKER_00]: They make a crap ton of money aside from selling it for 99 cents, which it pays for itself after a few plays.

2187
02:39:43,129 --> 02:39:45,631
[SPEAKER_09]: So Nintendo's just threatened by that lower price point.

2188
02:39:45,691 --> 02:39:55,759
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, Nintendo also, God, go in any hot topic and next to like one Angry Birds shirt, you'll see like 20 Nintendo classic franchise shirts.

2189
02:39:55,819 --> 02:39:59,242
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, everybody has a Nintendo lives off nostalgia, man.

2190
02:39:59,662 --> 02:40:00,522
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's the thing.

2191
02:40:00,962 --> 02:40:08,844
[SPEAKER_00]: Nintendo, on the other hand, I know they basically are marketing the Wii as more of a casual gamer system.

2192
02:40:09,304 --> 02:40:17,185
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, setting aside all the hardcores that they marketed to in the past.

2193
02:40:18,326 --> 02:40:20,146
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's pretty much it.

2194
02:40:20,746 --> 02:40:24,707
[SPEAKER_00]: What's happening is that they're getting outgunned by other more

2195
02:40:26,374 --> 02:40:29,839
[SPEAKER_00]: or easily available platforms like an iPhone or an Android.

2196
02:40:30,019 --> 02:40:33,965
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that most people would have in their pocket aside from a DS.

2197
02:40:34,486 --> 02:40:37,210
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's more than capable of running those games.

2198
02:40:39,193 --> 02:40:40,995
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, anything else on your mind tonight, Zaku?

2199
02:40:42,632 --> 02:40:48,254
[SPEAKER_00]: Back to the Future, the game, the first episode is pretty much free from their Telltale Games site.

2200
02:40:48,615 --> 02:40:49,935
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty awesome so far.

2201
02:40:50,235 --> 02:40:51,236
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, you having a good time with that?

2202
02:40:51,336 --> 02:40:54,537
[SPEAKER_00]: Even contrary to what the others are saying, it's getting better.

2203
02:40:55,217 --> 02:40:57,518
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hearing the third episode is actually the best so far.

2204
02:40:58,318 --> 02:41:00,579
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm really excited for their Jurassic Park game.

2205
02:41:00,679 --> 02:41:02,960
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what it is, but they had a new trailer.

2206
02:41:02,980 --> 02:41:09,543
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like an adventure game where you just click around to solve puzzles based on the storyline of Back to the Future.

2207
02:41:09,563 --> 02:41:10,223
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm-hmm.

2208
02:41:11,167 --> 02:41:16,129
[SPEAKER_00]: and the guy who basically does Marty's voice is very close.

2209
02:41:16,329 --> 02:41:18,951
[SPEAKER_00]: Does almost a spot on impression of Michael J. Fox.

2210
02:41:19,311 --> 02:41:19,551
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.

2211
02:41:19,611 --> 02:41:21,132
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to actually listen to it though.

2212
02:41:21,612 --> 02:41:21,812
[SPEAKER_09]: I do.

2213
02:41:21,892 --> 02:41:23,553
[SPEAKER_09]: I really need to play the Back to the Future.

2214
02:41:23,873 --> 02:41:28,255
[SPEAKER_09]: I forgot that it was the free time for it now that it's out.

2215
02:41:28,275 --> 02:41:32,557
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I remember the whole story is about the code word being in the Blu-ray and everything.

2216
02:41:32,577 --> 02:41:33,957
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's cool that it's out there for free now.

2217
02:41:33,977 --> 02:41:34,898
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'll definitely have to check that out.

2218
02:41:34,938 --> 02:41:36,379
[SPEAKER_00]: The first episode is out for free.

2219
02:41:36,699 --> 02:41:36,879
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

2220
02:41:36,979 --> 02:41:38,640
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to get you on the other ones though.

2221
02:41:38,940 --> 02:41:39,100
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

2222
02:41:40,089 --> 02:41:41,612
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well, Zaku, take care, buddy.

2223
02:41:41,733 --> 02:41:42,775
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see you next time.

2224
02:41:43,356 --> 02:41:43,837
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, bye.

2225
02:41:50,492 --> 02:41:54,595
[SPEAKER_09]: Contradictory things in both cases, so they're lying somewhere.

2226
02:42:16,147 --> 02:42:16,927
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, that's Sony America.

2227
02:42:16,967 --> 02:42:17,568
[SPEAKER_10]: They're behind it.

2228
02:42:17,588 --> 02:42:18,068
[SPEAKER_10]: Which is it, Sony?

2229
02:42:18,088 --> 02:42:21,570
[SPEAKER_10]: You're on record saying both, so you perjured yourself one way or another.

2230
02:42:37,387 --> 02:42:37,687
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2231
02:42:37,707 --> 02:42:39,989
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to try this call again, see if it's better.

2232
02:42:40,029 --> 02:42:40,829
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2233
02:42:40,849 --> 02:42:41,190
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

2234
02:42:41,810 --> 02:42:42,371
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Ranma.

2235
02:42:42,411 --> 02:42:43,471
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you hear me better now?

2236
02:42:43,511 --> 02:42:45,413
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, and you're not giving that horrible feedback.

2237
02:42:45,453 --> 02:42:46,293
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what that was about.

2238
02:42:46,914 --> 02:42:48,795
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's something with my computer.

2239
02:42:48,815 --> 02:42:51,717
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's long overdue for a fresh Windows installation.

2240
02:42:51,917 --> 02:42:54,839
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe Sony is trying to get inside your computer and see what you're really doing with it.

2241
02:42:55,620 --> 02:43:00,163
[SPEAKER_05]: Either that, maybe because Logitech gets pissed because I dumped their headset for a better Microsoft one.

2242
02:43:00,443 --> 02:43:02,144
[SPEAKER_05]: Sony Cat is watching you masturbate.

2243
02:43:02,905 --> 02:43:04,105
[SPEAKER_05]: I could give two shits about that.

2244
02:43:04,245 --> 02:43:04,506
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2245
02:43:05,386 --> 02:43:06,207
[SPEAKER_09]: What's on your mind tonight?

2246
02:43:07,263 --> 02:43:14,926
[SPEAKER_05]: Something a little bit different as if you remember what we talked about NPM last week, I upgraded my phone.

2247
02:43:15,326 --> 02:43:20,148
[SPEAKER_05]: I now have an Android phone and I'm doing something I thought I'd never find myself doing.

2248
02:43:20,228 --> 02:43:20,608
[SPEAKER_09]: What's that?

2249
02:43:22,034 --> 02:43:22,735
[SPEAKER_09]: Mobile gaming.

2250
02:43:23,295 --> 02:43:24,076
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my gosh.

2251
02:43:24,216 --> 02:43:24,597
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2252
02:43:25,418 --> 02:43:27,059
[SPEAKER_09]: Took the plunge and do some mobile gaming.

2253
02:43:27,239 --> 02:43:32,785
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, do you have a phone that has like actual tangible controls or is like an all touchscreen phone like the iPhone?

2254
02:43:33,566 --> 02:43:33,826
[SPEAKER_09]: Both.

2255
02:43:34,647 --> 02:43:37,390
[SPEAKER_05]: I have the Samsung Epic 4G touchscreen.

2256
02:43:37,510 --> 02:43:39,632
[SPEAKER_05]: If I slide it out, I have keyboard access.

2257
02:43:39,893 --> 02:43:40,093
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

2258
02:43:41,533 --> 02:43:48,437
[SPEAKER_05]: But so far the games I've played is completely in total touchscreen, which is not so bad, even with the screen protector on it.

2259
02:43:49,438 --> 02:43:50,599
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, what kind of games have you been playing?

2260
02:43:50,679 --> 02:43:51,719
[SPEAKER_09]: Tell us about some of the better ones.

2261
02:43:52,440 --> 02:43:57,483
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you could probably assume I have that game everyone has been talking about, Angry Birds.

2262
02:43:57,823 --> 02:43:58,223
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course.

2263
02:43:59,304 --> 02:44:02,426
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm playing it, I'm like, I can see why people are into it.

2264
02:44:02,526 --> 02:44:06,188
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like the new version of Worms or something like that, you know?

2265
02:44:08,625 --> 02:44:14,831
[SPEAKER_05]: And as I was going through the marketplace, I came across this one game that you probably tickled pink over the name of it.

2266
02:44:16,573 --> 02:44:17,454
[SPEAKER_05]: It's called Pew Pew.

2267
02:44:18,255 --> 02:44:19,076
[SPEAKER_05]: Pew Pew!

2268
02:44:20,998 --> 02:44:21,378
[SPEAKER_05]: What is it?

2269
02:44:21,398 --> 02:44:22,980
[SPEAKER_05]: Does it involve kittens with lasers?

2270
02:44:24,061 --> 02:44:26,764
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's pretty much Geometry Wars.

2271
02:44:27,164 --> 02:44:27,725
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's kind of cool.

2272
02:44:29,141 --> 02:44:31,243
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2273
02:44:46,918 --> 02:44:52,624
[SPEAKER_05]: And as I'm going through the marketplace, I can understand why Nintendo said what they said.

2274
02:44:52,905 --> 02:44:56,328
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the GDC about these games on the 3DS.

2275
02:44:56,628 --> 02:44:56,829
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

2276
02:44:57,309 --> 02:45:01,934
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I look through here and I'm like, yeah, a lot of these games are total and utter crap.

2277
02:45:02,034 --> 02:45:06,439
[SPEAKER_05]: Call me crazy if I'm dropping $250 on a gaming comp.

2278
02:45:06,799 --> 02:45:09,122
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like some quality games, you know?

2279
02:45:09,322 --> 02:45:09,502
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

2280
02:45:11,055 --> 02:45:11,415
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.com

2281
02:45:26,913 --> 02:45:30,375
[SPEAKER_05]: for like $20 or something like that, that probably wouldn't be so bad.

2282
02:45:30,535 --> 02:45:33,356
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, funny enough, there's something like that on Steam, or at least there was.

2283
02:45:33,416 --> 02:45:34,917
[SPEAKER_09]: It was either April Fool's Day or the day after.

2284
02:45:34,937 --> 02:45:39,219
[SPEAKER_09]: There was like 13 independent games going for like maybe $29 or $39.

2285
02:45:40,480 --> 02:45:41,921
[SPEAKER_09]: And one of them was like Super Meat Boy.

2286
02:45:41,941 --> 02:45:43,441
[SPEAKER_09]: There were some big titles in there.

2287
02:45:43,521 --> 02:45:46,283
[SPEAKER_09]: VVV, which I think Actdeft's called in about before was in there.

2288
02:45:46,623 --> 02:45:47,623
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I remember that.

2289
02:45:47,784 --> 02:45:51,365
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, high-profile indie games was in this big pack lately.

2290
02:45:51,765 --> 02:45:54,647
[SPEAKER_09]: So sometimes the indie games will band together for big sales like that.

2291
02:45:56,124 --> 02:45:56,584
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely.

2292
02:45:56,904 --> 02:46:05,128
[SPEAKER_05]: And I started to notice that, yeah, I'm playing, I'm playing around with these games a lot more than my DS because my phone is right there.

2293
02:46:05,168 --> 02:46:07,389
[SPEAKER_05]: Pull it out, hit the button, the game starts.

2294
02:46:07,689 --> 02:46:11,571
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereas I got to pull it out of my bag, fire it up, pick the game and start it up.

2295
02:46:11,651 --> 02:46:13,632
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I guess it's like convenience.

2296
02:46:13,752 --> 02:46:16,293
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a portable system where you don't have to think about grabbing the system.

2297
02:46:16,513 --> 02:46:17,734
[SPEAKER_09]: You just, you always have it on you.

2298
02:46:19,194 --> 02:46:20,035
[SPEAKER_09]: And definitely, yes.

2299
02:46:21,104 --> 02:46:22,745
[SPEAKER_09]: Never Surrender, Never, Billy Mitchell

2300
02:46:50,241 --> 02:46:55,285
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just noticed that it's a limited edition shirt with his signature.

2301
02:46:55,986 --> 02:46:59,069
[SPEAKER_05]: It says, Billy Mitchell, Video Game Player of the Century.

2302
02:47:00,250 --> 02:47:01,851
[SPEAKER_04]: How about Jerk Face of the Century?

2303
02:47:02,391 --> 02:47:03,893
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that even better.

2304
02:47:05,794 --> 02:47:07,316
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I'm sure he's a nice guy.

2305
02:47:07,496 --> 02:47:08,397
[SPEAKER_04]: No, he's not actually.

2306
02:47:09,017 --> 02:47:09,758
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a big jerk.

2307
02:47:10,579 --> 02:47:12,340
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I've never talked to the guy.

2308
02:47:13,001 --> 02:47:14,922
[SPEAKER_04]: But he apparently sells really good barbecue sauce.

2309
02:47:15,283 --> 02:47:15,443
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey.

2310
02:47:17,042 --> 02:47:19,783
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me be the judge of that because I love my barbecue sauce.

2311
02:47:20,184 --> 02:47:20,564
[SPEAKER_09]: Me too.

2312
02:47:21,044 --> 02:47:22,164
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, Ranma, we're going to let you go.

2313
02:47:22,224 --> 02:47:24,385
[SPEAKER_09]: Try to fit in one more call before we end the Skype tonight.

2314
02:47:24,425 --> 02:47:25,286
[SPEAKER_09]: So take care, buddy.

2315
02:47:25,566 --> 02:47:25,746
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye.

2316
02:47:26,246 --> 02:47:26,426
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye.

2317
02:47:26,606 --> 02:47:26,786
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye.

2318
02:47:28,047 --> 02:47:28,607
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2319
02:47:28,847 --> 02:47:32,689
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see if we can take one more call on the Skype line.

2320
02:47:32,709 --> 02:47:35,810
[SPEAKER_09]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2321
02:47:36,170 --> 02:47:37,431
[SPEAKER_10]: Any other stories?

2322
02:47:38,789 --> 02:47:40,030
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, there is a new game.

2323
02:47:40,050 --> 02:47:42,391
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if you've ever played the game QWOP.

2324
02:47:42,411 --> 02:47:43,792
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember QWOP?

2325
02:47:44,653 --> 02:47:45,853
[SPEAKER_09]: I have not played QWOP.

2326
02:47:45,913 --> 02:47:47,094
[SPEAKER_10]: I've played a lot of crap.

2327
02:47:47,394 --> 02:47:48,435
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I have.

2328
02:47:48,455 --> 02:47:55,719
[SPEAKER_10]: But anyways, there's a new game called GURP, and it's a rock climbing game that requires you to basically kind of...

2329
02:47:56,800 --> 02:47:58,201
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, DarkTedStudio, what's up buddy?

2330
02:48:26,767 --> 02:48:28,408
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I think you can probably, yeah.

2331
02:48:28,548 --> 02:48:31,949
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, I was going to say, this has got to be about WonderCon.

2332
02:48:32,030 --> 02:48:35,091
[SPEAKER_09]: I know you were really excited about your trip out to WonderCon, which happened this week.

2333
02:48:35,491 --> 02:48:37,352
[SPEAKER_09]: Tell us about some of the games you saw at WonderCon.

2334
02:48:39,833 --> 02:48:40,393
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, man.

2335
02:48:40,413 --> 02:48:49,838
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Nintendo had a huge booth, and they were showing off all of the 3DS games they had.

2336
02:48:50,118 --> 02:48:51,739
[SPEAKER_09]: Did anything catch your eyes over there?

2337
02:48:51,759 --> 02:48:52,359
[SPEAKER_09]: It was pretty cool.

2338
02:48:54,577 --> 02:48:55,859
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I liked that a little bit.

2339
02:48:55,919 --> 02:48:56,701
[SPEAKER_07]: Steel Diver.

2340
02:48:57,121 --> 02:48:57,342
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh-huh.

2341
02:48:57,362 --> 02:48:59,746
[SPEAKER_07]: That one was pretty cool.

2342
02:48:59,866 --> 02:49:01,549
[SPEAKER_09]: Was that the first time you ever got to touch a 3DS?

2343
02:49:01,629 --> 02:49:03,512
[SPEAKER_09]: Was that the first time you ever got to get your hands on a 3DS?

2344
02:49:03,913 --> 02:49:04,293
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

2345
02:49:04,514 --> 02:49:05,656
[SPEAKER_09]: What'd you think about the 3D?

2346
02:49:05,736 --> 02:49:07,519
[SPEAKER_09]: What'd you think about it when you first saw it?

2347
02:49:09,195 --> 02:49:11,416
[SPEAKER_09]: Badly also had Kate Icarus Oh, did they?

2348
02:49:11,436 --> 02:49:12,897
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice, was it playable or was it just like a trailer?

2349
02:49:39,526 --> 02:49:40,447
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, no, it was playable.

2350
02:49:40,927 --> 02:49:41,287
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, shit, nice.

2351
02:49:41,307 --> 02:49:44,189
[SPEAKER_07]: I felt like, I don't know if you ever played Sin and Punishment.

2352
02:49:44,449 --> 02:49:44,709
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh-huh.

2353
02:49:46,510 --> 02:49:47,711
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it kind of felt like that.

2354
02:49:48,011 --> 02:49:48,332
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.

2355
02:49:48,472 --> 02:49:59,979
[SPEAKER_09]: By the way, Sin and Punishment was... Sin and Punishment was another one of those games that Fries, that they had like 20 extra copies of that they were trying to get rid of, the new one that was out on the Wii.

2356
02:50:00,559 --> 02:50:01,560
[SPEAKER_09]: It's unfortunate.

2357
02:50:02,020 --> 02:50:03,041
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, sorry about that, DT.

2358
02:50:03,101 --> 02:50:05,202
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's all right.

2359
02:50:05,563 --> 02:50:08,785
[SPEAKER_09]: But, okay, well, what other, like, did Capcom have anything?

2360
02:50:08,825 --> 02:50:10,426
[SPEAKER_09]: I know you always try to run over there and look at their booth.

2361
02:50:12,307 --> 02:50:18,991
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah, well, most of the stuff they had, those stuff was already out, but they did have Resident Evil, which was, oh, it's alright, I guess.

2362
02:50:19,171 --> 02:50:19,551
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, cool.

2363
02:50:20,492 --> 02:50:20,852
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

2364
02:50:21,932 --> 02:50:23,013
[SPEAKER_07]: I had a little trouble with it.

2365
02:50:24,734 --> 02:50:25,114
[SPEAKER_09]: What else?

2366
02:50:25,194 --> 02:50:25,715
[SPEAKER_09]: Any other games?

2367
02:50:28,956 --> 02:50:31,658
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see, they had the, all the big movie games.

2368
02:50:32,065 --> 02:50:35,846
[SPEAKER_07]: comic book movie games like Thor and Captain America and Green Lantern

2369
02:50:54,406 --> 02:50:54,887
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, well, whatever.

2370
02:50:55,347 --> 02:50:55,567
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

2371
02:50:55,708 --> 02:50:56,669
[SPEAKER_09]: Huge superhero?

2372
02:50:56,689 --> 02:50:58,050
[SPEAKER_10]: Comic book movies.

2373
02:50:58,291 --> 02:51:01,374
[SPEAKER_04]: There's Thor, there's Captain America, Green Lantern.

2374
02:51:01,394 --> 02:51:02,656
[SPEAKER_06]: There's the big three.

2375
02:51:03,937 --> 02:51:05,239
[SPEAKER_04]: There's X-Men First Class.

2376
02:51:05,339 --> 02:51:07,461
[SPEAKER_04]: Is the Spider-Man reboot this year or is that next year?

2377
02:51:07,501 --> 02:51:08,502
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's not for a while.

2378
02:51:08,563 --> 02:51:08,903
[SPEAKER_04]: Next year.

2379
02:51:09,504 --> 02:51:09,664
[SPEAKER_01]: Huh.

2380
02:51:10,104 --> 02:51:14,567
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, but they're also, I think, going to be rebooting Fantastic Four.

2381
02:51:14,607 --> 02:51:18,029
[SPEAKER_09]: Transformers, if you want to count that as a... Another Superman.

2382
02:51:19,110 --> 02:51:20,230
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, Batman.

2383
02:51:21,171 --> 02:51:24,873
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah, Batman 3's next year, and that I'm excited about, but I don't know how the game would be.

2384
02:51:25,814 --> 02:51:32,878
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I did see your write-up, uh, is available over at orangeloungeradio.com, so it looks like you kept a little deer diary while you were there and saw stuff.

2385
02:51:33,078 --> 02:51:34,999
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, I have to ask, did you get to see the masquerade at all?

2386
02:51:36,940 --> 02:51:37,641
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, a little bit.

2387
02:51:37,801 --> 02:51:38,822
[SPEAKER_09]: Since I had costumes...

2388
02:51:40,225 --> 02:51:44,864
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you see by chance the Main Street Electronica Parade?

2389
02:51:46,664 --> 02:51:47,825
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh no, I didn't see that.

2390
02:51:48,125 --> 02:51:48,305
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh wow.

2391
02:52:11,880 --> 02:52:13,480
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well DT, I'm glad you had fun at the show.

2392
02:52:13,601 --> 02:52:15,621
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, we will actually have to go some year.

2393
02:52:15,661 --> 02:52:20,002
[SPEAKER_09]: This was just really not a good year for me to go, but I am hoping we will go to 5A this year.

2394
02:52:20,702 --> 02:52:22,263
[SPEAKER_09]: That is something we're trying to do, so we'll see.

2395
02:52:22,703 --> 02:52:22,923
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

2396
02:52:23,183 --> 02:52:24,804
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably going to go back next year, so.

2397
02:52:25,164 --> 02:52:25,404
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.

2398
02:52:25,424 --> 02:52:26,504
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we'll try to make it next year.

2399
02:52:27,264 --> 02:52:27,524
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

2400
02:52:28,265 --> 02:52:30,865
[SPEAKER_09]: Take care and check out that article at orangelaundry.com by DT.

2401
02:52:30,945 --> 02:52:31,526
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, bye guys.

2402
02:52:32,966 --> 02:52:33,066
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

2403
02:52:34,514 --> 02:52:35,434
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know why I said guys.

2404
02:52:35,715 --> 02:52:36,595
[SPEAKER_09]: I said bye to you guys.

2405
02:52:36,675 --> 02:52:37,175
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye to you guys.

2406
02:52:37,195 --> 02:52:38,035
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to go read that article.

2407
02:52:38,396 --> 02:52:38,656
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2408
02:52:39,116 --> 02:52:40,917
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it is about time to say bye, guys.

2409
02:52:41,157 --> 02:52:41,997
[SPEAKER_09]: The show is about over.

2410
02:52:42,857 --> 02:52:44,598
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks, you guys, though, for tuning in to us.

2411
02:52:44,618 --> 02:52:45,919
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to close up the Skype line.

2412
02:52:46,199 --> 02:52:47,900
[SPEAKER_09]: If you didn't get through tonight, sorry.

2413
02:52:48,440 --> 02:52:49,880
[SPEAKER_09]: Try sending us an email next time.

2414
02:52:50,401 --> 02:52:54,082
[SPEAKER_09]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadar.com is the place where you can send us an email.

2415
02:52:54,983 --> 02:52:58,444
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me ask Loki one more time if there's any last-minute stories before we wrap it all up.

2416
02:52:58,604 --> 02:52:59,545
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2417
02:53:16,920 --> 02:53:17,861
[SPEAKER_10]: Head tracking, pretty awesome.

2418
02:53:17,881 --> 02:53:21,882
[SPEAKER_10]: They're saying, yes, you'll be able to use head tracking to look into the corners when you're driving and stuff.

2419
02:53:22,103 --> 02:53:28,806
[SPEAKER_10]: Although that's a little awkward for me, I think, because if your TV's in front of you, you can't really turn your head to the side.

2420
02:53:28,826 --> 02:53:31,007
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be a little weird, yeah.

2421
02:53:31,207 --> 02:53:38,911
[SPEAKER_10]: And that'd be cool if the multiple monitors support or whatever, but once again, why would you need head tracking if you have multiple monitors?

2422
02:53:40,511 --> 02:53:43,993
[SPEAKER_10]: But hey, glad to see they're using head tracking, so that'll be awesome.

2423
02:53:46,013 --> 02:53:46,873
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, very cool.

2424
02:53:47,093 --> 02:53:51,515
[SPEAKER_09]: This might be a little hint of what is to come for the next generation of Kinect and this could be very, very good.

2425
02:53:51,795 --> 02:53:52,035
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

2426
02:53:52,055 --> 02:53:52,515
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll see.

2427
02:53:53,135 --> 02:53:58,897
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well it's that time of the show where we go around and get everybody's final thought as we wrap up another week here at Orange Lounge Radio.

2428
02:53:59,237 --> 02:54:00,958
[SPEAKER_09]: Salacious Pop, thanks again for being here.

2429
02:54:01,138 --> 02:54:02,239
[SPEAKER_09]: You did a lot of talking this week.

2430
02:54:02,259 --> 02:54:02,939
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm very proud of you.

2431
02:54:03,039 --> 02:54:03,199
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

2432
02:54:03,399 --> 02:54:06,040
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, so thanks and do you have any final thoughts for our listeners?

2433
02:54:08,040 --> 02:54:08,161
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

2434
02:54:08,181 --> 02:54:08,221
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

2435
02:54:13,340 --> 02:54:14,261
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright then, alright.

2436
02:54:15,542 --> 02:54:17,244
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see, DarkSakura, I guess I'll go to you next.

2437
02:54:17,264 --> 02:54:18,645
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

2438
02:54:19,486 --> 02:54:20,247
[SPEAKER_04]: I want more Pinkberry.

2439
02:54:22,173 --> 02:54:51,281
[SPEAKER_09]: and my final thought along those lines is that the lychee pink berry can go to hell, blood orange forever it's not gross, it's good it's not blood orange but the mango is amazing whatever, it's not blood orange alright Loki, your final thoughts tonight um I don't know I'm down to my US 3DS system I got rid of all the rest aww, that's great did the wife catch ya?

2440
02:54:52,692 --> 02:54:52,892
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

2441
02:54:53,273 --> 02:54:54,434
[SPEAKER_04]: Woohoo!

2442
02:54:54,674 --> 02:54:55,776
[SPEAKER_06]: He was like, why would she?

2443
02:54:55,916 --> 02:54:56,156
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

2444
02:54:56,637 --> 02:54:59,160
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you're going to come home, catch you what?

2445
02:55:00,562 --> 02:55:02,505
[SPEAKER_10]: No, she doesn't listen to the show.

2446
02:55:02,685 --> 02:55:04,107
[SPEAKER_10]: I was talking to her last week.

2447
02:55:04,868 --> 02:55:06,890
[SPEAKER_10]: She listened for just a minute.

2448
02:55:07,331 --> 02:55:08,172
[SPEAKER_10]: It was like...

2449
02:55:09,213 --> 02:55:10,754
[SPEAKER_10]: Just long enough for a baby to hear daddy.

2450
02:55:11,054 --> 02:55:12,534
[SPEAKER_10]: Pretty much, yeah.

2451
02:55:13,995 --> 02:55:16,575
[SPEAKER_10]: She's trying to get him for two naps tonight.

2452
02:55:17,276 --> 02:55:20,797
[SPEAKER_10]: Last night he woke up, like with me, I woke up with him at 5.

2453
02:55:20,837 --> 02:55:22,917
[SPEAKER_10]: I usually wake up with him at 5 in the morning.

2454
02:55:23,638 --> 02:55:24,398
[SPEAKER_10]: Every day.

2455
02:55:25,418 --> 02:55:26,279
[SPEAKER_10]: On the weekends even.

2456
02:55:27,319 --> 02:55:31,440
[SPEAKER_10]: And so he wouldn't go back down to bed for like about an hour.

2457
02:55:32,080 --> 02:55:33,421
[SPEAKER_10]: Just trying to get him to go back down.

2458
02:55:33,561 --> 02:55:35,021
[SPEAKER_10]: And he finally slept until 7.40.

2459
02:55:35,061 --> 02:55:35,121
[SPEAKER_10]: But...

2460
02:55:37,783 --> 02:55:59,644
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm actually now able to be wide awake at 5 in the morning which works out because I can work on my PC sometimes and able to work on Grand Theft Auto map edits and stuff like that really in the morning without being interrupted but it's tough I have to take naps now on the weekends sometimes because there's only so many days you can wake up that early and not be affected by it

2461
02:56:00,545 --> 02:56:05,448
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Rob naps every day and he doesn't even have a kid, so don't feel too bad.

2462
02:56:05,528 --> 02:56:06,229
[SPEAKER_06]: You've earned those naps.

2463
02:56:06,249 --> 02:56:09,310
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, ring ring, hi pot, it's Kettle on the phone.

2464
02:56:10,091 --> 02:56:19,617
[SPEAKER_10]: I wanted to say, and I know they're not listening obviously, and I don't think they listen normally, but congratulations to our friends Eric and Mel for their brand new baby girl.

2465
02:56:20,337 --> 02:56:21,438
[SPEAKER_10]: So, that's awesome.

2466
02:56:21,478 --> 02:56:22,578
[SPEAKER_10]: Someone finally had a girl.

2467
02:56:22,999 --> 02:56:29,863
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, it's like a big sausage fest, but finally getting some girls in here.

2468
02:56:30,207 --> 02:56:30,578
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

2469
02:56:31,707 --> 02:56:34,449
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well that does it for another week here at Orange Lounge Radio.

2470
02:56:34,469 --> 02:56:37,150
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you guys so much for tuning in and supporting Independent Radio.

2471
02:56:37,430 --> 02:56:40,012
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, all we ask, if you like our show, help us spread the word.

2472
02:56:40,052 --> 02:56:41,813
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't have big budget advertising dollars.

2473
02:56:42,153 --> 02:56:43,734
[SPEAKER_09]: Say something nice about us on a forum.

2474
02:56:43,774 --> 02:56:45,015
[SPEAKER_09]: Tell your friends about the show.

2475
02:56:45,055 --> 02:56:46,215

2477
02:56:50,778 --> 02:56:53,780
[SPEAKER_09]: Till next week, we'll be back to do it all again one more time.

2478
02:56:53,880 --> 02:56:54,240
[SPEAKER_09]: Episode 409.

2479
02:56:55,240 --> 02:56:57,582
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess that means we have to do some cleaning next week because it's 409.

2480
02:56:57,622 --> 02:56:58,542
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, I cleaned that desk.

2481
02:56:58,582 --> 02:56:58,722
[SPEAKER_04]: You did.

2482
02:56:58,742 --> 02:57:00,043
[SPEAKER_04]: You better not need cleaning next week.

2483
02:57:00,764 --> 02:57:01,344
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll dirty it up.

2484
02:57:01,364 --> 02:57:01,444
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

2485
02:57:02,284 --> 02:57:04,846
[SPEAKER_04]: It's dust free, lemony fresh.

2486
02:57:06,026 --> 02:57:07,067
[SPEAKER_09]: But Shermie tainted.

2487
02:57:07,947 --> 02:57:09,008
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, of course, duh.

2488
02:57:09,788 --> 02:57:10,029
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2489
02:57:10,289 --> 02:57:10,729
[SPEAKER_09]: That does it.

2490
02:57:10,769 --> 02:57:11,689
[SPEAKER_09]: Have a wonderful week, everybody.

2491
02:57:11,729 --> 02:57:14,651
