I'll be joining you over the next few hours

With my co-host, the one and only

Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Fwee

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
How are you?

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Fwee

23
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm actually full

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm actually full

25
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Full?

26
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I made a delicious

27
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Full of crap?

28
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Uh uh, no that's Shermie

29
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I had a delicious meal that I cooked myself

30
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Alright

31
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
By myself

32
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Now bake me a pie

33
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I don't know how to bake

34
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Anything that I've ever baked

35
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Except for my failure cake that I told you about last night

36
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Has been a disaster

37
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
And can you tell the listeners what a failure cake is briefly

38
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Failure cake

39
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Before we get into video game time

40
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Was me making chocolate pancakes

41
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
And then getting bored with the rest of the batter

42
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Because I didn't want any more pancakes

43
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
So I poured the chocolate batter into a cake pan

44
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
And then put some giant chocolate chips on it

45
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
And then baked the whole thing

46
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
And it tasted delicious

47
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I don't know about you guys, I'd still eat that

48
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Even though it's a cake of failure

49
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
It was delicious, delicious fail

50
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Alright

51
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
A host not full of fail

52
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Say hello to the one and only tech master, Loki

53
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Hello, how's it going?

54
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I am good, how are you, Loki?

55
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I am doing fine

56
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Alright, except we are

57
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Why are we not hearing you very well tonight?

58
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I don't know

59
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Why aren't you hearing me tonight?

60
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I think we're hearing you, you're just really quiet

61
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm really quiet?

62
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Yeah, you're good now

63
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Sorry

64
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I think we have to keep you kind of low

65
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Because when the Nintendo topics come up

66
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Oh yeah

67
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
You'll get a little louder!

68
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm not louder, I'm more opinionated

69
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You're passionate

70
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I am passionate, come on

71
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It's like, I don't know

72
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
It's just stupid people doing stupid things

73
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Alright, we've got a lot of interesting news stories tonight

74
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Kind of along those lines

75
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
We'll get to those in just a little bit

76
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
But first let's say hello to a guest here in studio tonight

77
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Back again this week

78
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Say hello to Salacious Pop

79
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
What up

80
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
How you doing Salacious Pop?

81
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Good

82
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Good, how has life been treating you lately?

83
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Um, been really busy

84
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Yeah?

85
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
What's been going on?

86
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Preparing for a move

87
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Yeah?

88
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You moving?

89
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Yeah

90
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You moving in with Jamie?

91
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
She's really lonely this week

92
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Yeah

93
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Alright

94
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
It's the vault, I'm just going to stay in the vault

95
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Awesome

96
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I don't even get to play anything, I just get to look at stuff

97
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It's awesome

98
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Now, we missed April Fools this year

99
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Because the show tonight is on the third

100
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
But you were mentioning a really good April Fools joke

101
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
You thought we should have done

102
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Well I can't talk about it or else I can't do it next year

103
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Oh yeah, we got to do it next year I guess

104
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Okay, it's really good y'all

105
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It was basically like

106
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,000
OLR Episode 3 coming like from the vault of 1982

107
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Where with the news stories you're like

108
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Yeah, I'm really looking forward to that ET game on the Atari 2600

109
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It's going to be great

110
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
The only thing about that is it's kind of close to what YouTube did

111
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
So it'll be better next year

112
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Yeah

113
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Next year y'all forget

114
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
It's a little too close to Flugelhorn feline

115
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Which by the way was the best April Fools joke on the web

116
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Just so you know

117
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Alright, anyhow

118
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Well, by the way, Rob, it's not a rumor

119
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Now, see, oh

120
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Okay, before we went live tonight

121
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
See, now I have to talk about all this because you brought it up

122
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Okay, before we went live tonight

123
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Bobby was abbreviated tonight

124
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
So we went live a little bit early

125
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Just kind of BSing with the live listeners and doing some music

126
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
And one of the topics that came up before the show was

127
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
The Wachowski Brothers and they did The Matrix

128
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
And there's these rumors or something going around

129
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
That one of them had a sex change

130
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Larry is now Lana

131
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
But now, see, the chat room, Tiger Closener chat room

132
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Which by the way, hi chat room, chat.orangelsauce.com

133
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Saying that's not true

134
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It's on IMDB

135
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Is it?

136
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Yeah

137
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Credited on IMDB

138
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I thought some producer said it wasn't true, IDK

139
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Well, I mean, you know

140
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Alright, there you go

141
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Well, if it's on IMDB, I guess it's true

142
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You know what?

143
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
The Matrix 2 and 3 still sucked

144
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Boy or girl directing

145
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Yes

146
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Alright, let's talk about video games

147
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Of course, we do that here on the show

148
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Chat.orangelsauceradio.com

149
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
If you're listening to us live on this Sunday night at All Games Radio

So join us in our chat room

To get to the chat room, chat.orangelsauceradio.com

154
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Have I plugged all the websites?

155
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I believe so

156
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Twitter, OLR, Facebook, Orangelsauce Radio, etc, etc

157
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Now we can talk about games

158
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Hi Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

159
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Hi

160
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I played a lot of Dragon Age 2

161
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I borrowed it from my friend's husband

162
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Well, he's my friend too

163
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
But I borrowed his game

164
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
And it's really fun

165
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
And I'm kind of hooked

166
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
And I played some WoW

167
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
And some Final Fantasy 3

168
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And then I looked at games at Fry's with U2

169
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Yes

170
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
That was it

171
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
We went shopping last night and not for shoes

172
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I didn't buy anything

173
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I know, it's kind of sad to go to a huge electronics store like Fry's

174
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Which, I don't think they have those everywhere

175
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I think just on the west coast

176
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
So Fry's is just like, it's an uber electronics store

177
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I think they're spread around

178
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Yeah, there might be a few in other places

179
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
But yeah, it's an uber electronics store

180
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Huge games section, huge computer section

181
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
We went in there, looked around

182
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Didn't buy anything

183
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
It's kind of sad

184
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Their PSP section amazed me

185
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
They do have a lot

186
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
That still exists

187
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Well, there's still a lot of good stuff coming on the PSP

188
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
The UMD's

189
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Yeah, the UMD's were what impressed me too

190
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
That they're still really supporting them

191
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
$10 for most of them

192
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Because they got them really cheap, I'm sure

193
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I guess so, I don't know

194
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You know, there's only one company still supporting UMD

195
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
And that's Sony

196
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Of course

197
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I don't remember the last movie

198
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I want to say 2012 was one of the last movies to come out for it

199
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Zira, they are kick-ass

200
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Whatever came out last

201
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
No, I know I was looking and I was like

202
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Oh, Charlie's Angels Full Throttle is only $4

203
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
And they have like 40 copies of it sitting on the shelf

204
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
That's kind of the sad thing is that sometimes Fry's just way over stocks

205
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
A certain game or something

206
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I'll tell you what else they had just hundreds

207
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm not even lying

208
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Hundreds of copies of just trying to get rid of them

209
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Castlevania Lords of Shadow

210
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Because it sucks

211
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
The new God of War-y Castlevania

212
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Because they're fucking cutthroat with their goddamn vendors

213
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Every time the vendors come out and stuff

214
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
And we get to talking about different customers

215
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
They're talking about visiting Fry's

216
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
They fucking hate visiting Fry's

217
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Because Fry's, they're just cutthroat

218
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
They want everything

219
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
And it's just, it's ridiculous

220
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
They're like, I hate fucking going and visiting Fry's

221
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
SolarFlare's in our chatroom at chat.org.com saying

222
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I've lived on the west coast for over 20 years and have never seen a Fry's

223
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Maybe they don't have them in Oregon

224
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I don't think they do, Oregon or Washington

225
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I'm not sure where SolarFlare's is

226
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
But I think they're mostly like

227
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I know there's a few in the bay, some in SoCal

228
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
There are some in Texas, I know that

229
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I think they dip into Arizona and the southwest a little bit

230
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
So I think they go south and west, not north and west, sadly

231
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
So, alright, anyhow

232
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Uh, Loki

233
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Wait, wait, I want to go back to Dark Soccer and talk more about Dragon Age 2

234
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Because I haven't played the game

235
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
So you're enjoying Dragon Age 2?

236
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Yes, it has Eve Miles doing a voice

237
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
For anyone who does not know, she was Gwen on Torchwood

238
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Now you didn't really play the first game, right?

239
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
No

240
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
And you're doing okay with the second game?

241
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Yeah, just fine

242
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
What is it that you like so much about it?

243
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Lesbians

244
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Have you...

245
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Did you draw that?

246
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Not really

247
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Have you actually gotten to the part where they, you know

248
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Well, right now Meryl the elf

249
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Is gushing over my character

250
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Which is kind of cute and funny

251
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Because my character is all like face tats

252
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
And red eyeshadows, she's really fierce looking

253
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
And she's a rogue

254
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
And, uh

255
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
But they've already had, like, love chat

256
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
And then there's this one guy who was hitting on my character

257
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I was like, no you're gross

258
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
But he was apparently from an earlier game

259
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
He's the one that you give him a cat called Sir Pouncealot

260
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I guess

261
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
He was talking about his cat

262
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
And then there's Isabella

263
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Who's, according to Tiara

264
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
She's a slut

265
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
She can sleep with her a bunch

266
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
And then she's like, oh, it's just sex

267
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
So, I'm like, I haven't gotten to any fun part though

268
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I mean, I've done a lot of

269
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I really like this game, but it's not fun

270
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
No

271
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
It's kind of what I just heard, it's just me

272
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I've done a lot of killing

273
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Which is great

274
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
And I've got it in extra gore mode

275
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
So, like, they're covered in blood

276
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
When you're done with a fight

277
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
And they're battered on their face

278
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
And then I was like, that's awesome

279
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Okay, gore and lesbians, got it

280
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
This game really isn't fun

281
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I'm just here for the pussy

282
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
And gore

283
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
It actually is really fun

284
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I'm still in the first act

285
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Okay, you're like in the grind or something, right?

286
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Yeah

287
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Trying to grind out that pussy

288
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Well, some elven cooch

289
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Say no more

290
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
What's the battle system like?

291
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
It's like you run down

292
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
The stairs, oh no, there's people there

293
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
And one of your party comments

294
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
About how there shouldn't be people on the street after dark

295
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
And then you have to kill them

296
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
And there's blood everywhere

297
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
And you occasionally

298
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
No, they're like highwaymen

299
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
And you can go outside of the town

300
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
To certain areas

301
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
And you'll find piles of bones

302
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
And you can dig through them for loot

303
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I see

304
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
It's really great though

305
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
And, okay, I guess

306
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
So now you're talking about touching bones

307
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
In your quest for pussy

308
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
My quest for pussy

309
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
No, it's

310
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
There's also, you know, you can go through people's stuff

311
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
And right now I'm actually trying to build up my character

312
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
So I can get the lock picking

313
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
So I can open locked

314
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Trunks and stuff and steal people's stuff

315
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
And

316
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
What else was I doing?

317
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
There's just, I'm doing

318
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
A lot of the side quests too

319
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
So I can level up before I get to the

320
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
The big thing

321
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
But there's somewhere else that I need

322
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
To go to get some dude named Fenris

323
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Who was, I think, in one of the last games

324
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Now it's gonna be a three way

325
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Well, no, I don't

326
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Okay, Meryl

327
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Is my fangirlism because

328
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I adore Eve Miles

329
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
She's very cool

330
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
And Welsh accents to me are hot

331
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Really hot

332
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Alright

333
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
And I don't

334
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
The elves that live outside

335
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Are all Welsh

336
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
The elves and humans that live in the town

337
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Are all British

338
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
And dwarves are American

339
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Is what I'm getting so far

340
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Whereas, you know, don't we usually

341
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Have dwarves being Scottish?

342
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Well, if you play WoW a lot, yeah, dwarves are Scottish

343
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Or, you know, Lord of the Rings

344
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Well, no, he sounded vaguely

345
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
He didn't, he sounded Welsh

346
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Alright, well, you think you'll play Dragon Age 2

347
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Through to completion?

348
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Yeah. Alright, that's good

349
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
It's always good to finish. I'll take pictures

350
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Of the lesbian scene. Alright, please do

351
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Alright, let's move on over to Loki

352
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Loki, how was your gaming week? Um, it was okay

353
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I played Motorstorm Apocalypse

354
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Through rookie mode now

355
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
And I think most of the way through

356
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Pro mode

357
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Although, it's like, all the races have been

358
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Somewhat difficult up until now

359
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
And it's just like

360
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
And now it's really, really hard

361
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
So, I'm actually stuck on one

362
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Race right now

363
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
But, really enjoying it still

364
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Storyline's still really cheesy

365
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
But, still

366
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Pretty fun game

367
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
And then, I've been playing

368
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
On my 3DS

369
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Really only pilot wings right now

370
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
And I haven't really played any of the

371
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Like, I don't know

372
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
The missions or whatever you have to do

373
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Different challenges

374
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Mainly the free-flying

375
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Which is kind of annoying a little bit

376
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Because you can only fly around for like

377
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
A few minutes at a time

378
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Which is so

379
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Stupid

380
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
It's like 3 minutes at a time

381
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Fun!

382
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Well, I mean, you do only have a limited amount of fuel, right?

383
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Well, okay

384
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
If you want to go by that route

385
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Then why can't I have it

386
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Where I refuel, or

387
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Gas is expensive, you know

388
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Or, like, when I'm using the rocket belt

389
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I never get low on fuel

390
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I could hold that fuel

391
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
You know, the throttle down the whole way

392
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
And it just never would run out of fuel

393
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
But, um

394
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I'm basically collecting these markers

395
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Or whatever they're in the game

396
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
And I have 74 of 75 of them

397
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
So, I'm still trying to find the last one

398
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
But, it's just like

399
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
You know, the Wuhu Island thing

400
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
It's like

401
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Oh, hey, look at this

402
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
This is from Wii Sports Resort

403
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Oh, this is the part where you can, uh

404
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Here's the bowling alley, here's all this stuff from the game

405
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I'm like, okay, well none of this has to do with

406
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Flying

407
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Can you, like, crash through the roof of the bowling alley?

408
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
No, you can't

409
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
How boring!

410
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
You can fly through tunnels and stuff

411
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
You know, it's kind of cool jogging around

412
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I guess in Wii Sports Resort or something

413
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Well, actually, no it wouldn't be

414
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Because you'd be jogging in place and that's really boring

415
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
But, um, I could see

416
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
If you're into jogging in place, what the appeal

417
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Might be, um

418
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
But, it's just

419
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
It seems really lazy to me

420
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I mean, they could have just easily created

421
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
A new island, it's not that damn

422
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Detailed at all, I mean

423
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Somebody could easily create an island within

424
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
A day

425
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I mean, there's no animations

426
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Whatsoever going around, there's no

427
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Cars moving around, no people running around

428
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
It's just all

429
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Not doing anything

430
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
It seems to be like a dark pilot wings

431
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Where you can, like, rocket belt into the bowling alley

432
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
And steal a baby and, like, run away with it

433
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Or, you know

434
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Yeah, see, once again

435
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
And this is unfortunate

436
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
This goes back to Nintendo

437
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
What they do with new games

438
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Or, I should say, games that they put out again

439
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
They basically take them

440
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
They don't add any features to it

441
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
And they strip it down to what the bare essentials

442
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
That they need to do another release for

443
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
It's just like all the Animal Crossing games

444
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
And here's the problem

445
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
People like us keep buying them

446
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
And so it teaches them

447
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Actually, you're the only one that's bought a 3DS in this room

448
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
No, I'm talking about Animal Crossing

449
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Oh, okay

450
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
No, I'm just saying, uh, it's people like us

451
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
That keep buying those crappy games

452
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
And it just gives them the impression

453
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Okay, so we don't really do anything

454
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
People just still buy our games

455
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
It's just like the whole Tron thing

456
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
What's different this year?

457
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
We put a 12 on the box

458
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I mean, it's okay

459
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
It's somewhat fun

460
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I haven't played through everything yet

461
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
But, you know, you're looking at

462
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
What was on the original Super Nintendo

463
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Version, it's just

464
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I'm sorry, it's even less content than that

465
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I mean, you really couldn't

466
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
You know, bother to

467
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Put the extra content in there

468
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
They don't even remove the landing pads

469
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
And stuff like that, they're in the different missions and stuff

470
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
They're in the free mode, they're just all sitting there

471
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Still, because they didn't bother to

472
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Even say, okay, well, during this mode

473
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
This isn't here, or whatever

474
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
It's just, it's always there

475
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Let me get you some questions from our chat room

476
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
At chat.orangesonshooter.com

477
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Robert M. is asking, Loki, Loki, can you shoot in pilot wings?

478
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
No balloon popping, at least?

479
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
There's a few levels in the mission mode

480
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Where you can do that

481
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Shooting or balloon popping? Or both?

482
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Both

483
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Let's see, TigerClaw is asking, what they should have done

484
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Is recreated that helicopter mission from the first pilot wings

485
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Most people never even saw those missions

486
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
The first pilot wings was hard

487
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Well, they've got some stuff that's

488
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Undocumented

489
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Or whatever, it's not on the box

490
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Where they have the squirrel suit

491
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Or whatever, you could do skydiving in there

492
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Wait, the squirrel suit?

493
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Yeah, like a flying squirrel suit

494
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
It's not really a squirrel suit

495
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
It's like, have you seen those

496
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Skydiving things that they've got the webbing

497
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Between your arm and your body

498
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
And the leg and your body

499
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
So it provides more drag so you can fly around

500
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
When we're talking about a flying squirrel

501
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I'm thinking of Rocky from the Rocky and Bowling Cool show

502
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
No, it's not like some stupid Mario

503
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Thing where you're in a tanooki suit

504
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Or some crap like that

505
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I'm literally imagining a

506
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Skydiving squirrel

507
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
That trick never works

508
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I'd pay to play that

509
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
But it's just

510
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I don't know

511
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
It's a fun game

512
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I guess, it's what I've been playing

513
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Just because I just wanted to play

514
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Through some of that

515
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I've played Ridge Racer a ton

516
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Street Fighter, it's alright

517
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I saw a question about the battery life

518
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Earlier in chat

519
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
And that's a bitch I've heard

520
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
The battery life isn't really that great

521
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
On these things

522
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I haven't really had a problem with it

523
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Because I keep charging it all the time

524
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I've never had it run out on me

525
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
But then again, I also

526
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Don't leave it in sleep mode

527
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Because I figured that the battery would go dead

528
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
And I kind of want to play the game

529
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
That's the thing, they have all these things that rely on sleep mode

530
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
And I know that doesn't suck

531
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
As much battery as playing a game would

532
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
But, you know, if it's

533
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Running out of battery that fast

534
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Why rely on sleep mode for all this stuff?

535
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Let me go to another

536
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Question from chat, and I think this is a good one

537
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Savalas in our chat room is asking

538
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
At chat.org.com

539
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Loki, do you have buyer's remorse with buying the

540
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Nintendo 3DS now that we're a week in?

541
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
No, not really

542
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I mean, I got the few games that I wanted to get

543
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
And that's it, and that's what I'm gonna plan on

544
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Getting until

545
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
You know, whenever the next best game comes out

546
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I mean, there's the

547
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Dream Trigger game that I'm thinking about getting

548
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Whenever the hell that comes out, and

549
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
That's pretty much it, I mean

550
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Everything else is gonna be fourth quarter, so

551
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I'm perfectly fine with what I have right now

552
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
That's why I didn't purposely go

553
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
And just buy all the stuff that came out launched

554
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Because a lot of it's crap

555
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
And a lot of it, you know, even the reviewers go

556
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
This is basically the game that

557
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Came up before, but now it's in 3D

558
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
And it doesn't really utilize 3D that much

559
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
And you're gonna get a lot of that stuff

560
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Because people don't know how to utilize it

561
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Or they're gonna try to cash in real quick

562
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Especially putting out a budget game

563
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Because all the games are $40

564
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
So a $20 game stands out because, hey, that's much cheaper

565
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
But

566
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
You get what you pay for? Exactly, yeah

567
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Alright

568
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
And then what else did I play? Oh, Game Dev Story

569
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
But still playing a little bit of that

570
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
That's kind of mindless because

571
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
My team is so good at developing

572
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Stuff that

573
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I mean, we beat out everybody in the awards

574
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
And all that stuff, it's kind of fun

575
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Even the fictional company

576
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
That's the game publisher

577
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Of the actual game

578
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Their

579
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Toilet system is not

580
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Doing well compared to

581
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Compared to my glory hole system

582
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Yes, that's what it's called, the glory hole

583
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Kay

584
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Everybody loves the glory hole

585
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Alright

586
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
And then Cry Theft Auto

587
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
That's what I played this week

588
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Alright, let me go over to SalaciousPop

589
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
How was your gaming week? It was alright

590
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Pretty slow

591
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Played some Pac-Man Championship Edition DX

592
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Some Super Street Fighter IV

593
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
A lot of the

594
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Mortal Kombat

595
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
PS3 demo

596
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
And I finally got to play Marvel vs. Capcom 3

597
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
What did you think of MVC 3?

598
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I really liked what I saw of it

599
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Definitely want to get it at some point

600
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
It has the sort of hybrid

601
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Four button controls that

602
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
The Dreamcast used for

603
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Marvel vs. Capcom 2

604
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
And then I guess also Tatsunoko vs. Capcom

605
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
For the Wii uses something similar

606
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
And I didn't realize that it played like that

607
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
So when I was using a six button

608
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Fight pad

609
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I wasn't quite landing the combos

610
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
That I thought I was because I realized

611
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Oh, well not all the buttons are mapped the way I thought they were

612
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
There's no low, medium, strong

613
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Punch, low, medium, strong kick

614
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
They're kind of combined

615
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Some of them

616
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
So yeah, I loved it

617
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Was there a particular character you really enjoyed?

618
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I don't

619
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Really care for her

620
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
In the context that she appears

621
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
In the Marvel universe

622
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
The female Wolverine

623
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Clone, X-23 I think her name is

624
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
She was fun to use

625
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Cool

626
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Anything else you want to share about your game a week?

627
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Um

628
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
The fatalities in the

629
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Mortal Kombat demo

630
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Are really gory but they're all kind of stupid

631
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
And they're all kind of the same

632
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
You think? Yeah

633
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
See, here's my whole thing

634
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
You know I hate the Saw movies and all that stuff

635
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
And I talk about this on the show

636
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
But yet I giggle so much at Mortal Kombat

637
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
And all the fatalities

638
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
And some of them are really bad

639
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Like the Melina one, what does Melina do?

640
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
She walks up to you like she's going to kiss you

641
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
And then she

642
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Sucks you up and spits you out

643
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
No it's not like you think that's what's going to happen

644
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
But she like rips off your face

645
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
She throws her thighs at you

646
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
So they're out of your rib cage

647
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
So you're all spiked

648
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
And then she makes like this

649
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I guess Melina's always horny or whatever

650
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
She's always moaning and cooing

651
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
So it looks like she's going to kiss you

652
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
And then she rips your head off at the jawline

653
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
So that your chin and jaw

654
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Is still attached and your body falls over

655
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Then she eats your tongue

656
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Out of the head that she has in her hand

657
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
She doesn't just eat it, she goes

658
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Like it's sushi

659
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
She's got Baraka face

660
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
And then so she eats your tongue out of your

661
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Sort of severed head and then she just chucks it to the ground

662
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Like a football, like eh

663
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
And then she jumps on the camera

664
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
And like kind of tries to dry hump it

665
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Right? Well that's if you're

666
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
That's her non, like if you don't do a fatality

667
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
You just let them fall down

668
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
And then she like smears blood on her boobs

669
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Because again she's always horny

670
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Like I don't know what her problem is

671
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I bet yet the whole time I see this

672
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
For the first time I'm giggling maniacally

673
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
And like Alan's like what's wrong with you

674
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
And as soon as, I know I don't really appreciate

675
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
The whole TNA fighter game thing at all

676
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Because as soon as I saw her buck naked outfit

677
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I'm like she's going to get a yeast infection

678
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
In that onesie

679
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
She has a naked outfit?

680
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
She's not really naked

681
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
She's wearing floss

682
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
She's wearing floss

683
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
And the best part

684
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Is that this new Mortal Kombat

685
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Game, the blood kind of seems to stay

686
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
On the characters and it stays like

687
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
In kind of natural looking ways

688
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
So after she's fighting or whatever, her boobs will be like

689
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Covered in blood and she's like rubbing her boobs

690
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
It's all like, it's really

691
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Disgusting but funny

692
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
It's just a PS3 demo

693
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
It's not the game yet

694
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Because the demo has four characters in it

695
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
And the fatality for Scorpion

696
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
If you look it up in the off menu

697
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Is wrong

698
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
The fatality for Scorpion was just backwards

699
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
That was funny

700
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Actually wait, hold on

701
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
You know what I should do here

702
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Is I should actually just pull this up real quick

703
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
It is a three hour show, we have time to do some fun things here

704
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Describe Scorpion's fatality for us real quick

705
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Because that was pretty funny too

706
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
He takes his katana

707
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
And he slices your head off

708
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
And then again at the waist

709
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
But he does it so fast

710
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Obviously it's going through you but you're still upright

711
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
And then he kicks

712
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Your stomach

713
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
So your middle piece flies back

714
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
So then your legs fall

715
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
And your head goes up in the air and then he cuts your head

716
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
In half like a cantaloupe

717
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Well I love the

718
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Fruit ninja reference there

719
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Okay, here you go Dark Soccer, you ready?

720
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Here you go, enjoy!

721
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
See she's all sexy walking

722
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
And then give me a kiss boy

723
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Sike

724
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
See and then she's all like rubbing her boobs

725
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
She's all mmm I just ate that guy's tongue

726
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:48,000
That's the best fatality ever

727
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
There you go

728
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
See, I gotta admit

729
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
I gave the demo an unfavorable review a couple weeks ago

730
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
It is growing on me a little bit

731
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
It's growing on me just a little bit

732
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I think having seen some more of the fatalities

733
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
And getting to do

734
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Like kind of getting more comfortable with the fighting system

735
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Because you know they took out the whole weapon thing

736
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
And all that's gone now

737
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
So it's a little bit back to old school

738
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
And you know kind of getting used to that again

739
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
It's growing on me, I think I will get the full version

740
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
So I can do more fatalities

741
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
And Salacious Pop can be very disappointed with me

742
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
And I have one other thing to add to my gaming week

743
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
So when I was

744
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
After I downloaded the Mortal Kombat demo for PS3

745
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I noticed there was a new Castlevania

746
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
And there have been so many Castlevania releases in the last two years

747
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
I was just like oh I'll get this whatever it is

748
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
And it's the one that just came out within the last month

749
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
What's it, we were just talking about it

750
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
What's the name, it's Castlevania

751
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Lords of Shadow

752
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Yeah, I played maybe ten minutes of it

753
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
And I was like okay well this is just them

754
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Trying to be God of War

755
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
And for some reason

756
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I don't want to say that it hurt to look at

757
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Like it didn't give me a headache

758
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
But just running around

759
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Something was off about the graphics visually

760
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
It was hard to look at, I don't know

761
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
But I was like okay this is God of War, Castlevania

762
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
And I just deleted it

763
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
It originally wasn't a Castlevania game

764
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Oh yeah that's right it wasn't supposed to be a Castlevania game originally

765
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
It's a new IP when we can just slap Castlevania on it

766
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
There you go

767
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
sj100matt is in our chat room talking about the Mortal Kombat demo

768
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
And the fatality is saying

769
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Rob you should show your mom the game

770
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Rob that's gross, Rob

771
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Actually that's a great idea for a future

772
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
OLR YouTube

773
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
She looks cold, she needs a jacket

774
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
We will get right on that

775
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
That sounds like a great future OLR YouTube

776
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Is Rob's mom plays Mortal Kombat

777
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
It'll be fine, good times

778
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Alright let's see my gaming week

779
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
There was some stuff that Salacious Pop did

780
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
But there was some different things

781
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
One night randomly we were having You Don't Know Jack

782
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Which has kind of become this strange Friday tradition

783
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
All of a sudden which I'm kind of liking

784
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Friday night playing You Don't Know Jack and drinking wine

785
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
I think you need stronger booze

786
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
But yeah the booze in You Don't Know Jack is good

787
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Wine keeps it classy

788
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Yes wine keeps it very classy

789
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
With the fart jokes in You Don't Know Jack

790
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Which is always hilarious

791
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
But then we just started playing old school games

792
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
And when I say old school I mean like

793
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Old school on the Xbox Live Arcade

794
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
And some things they don't even sell anymore

795
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
We were playing Smash TV

796
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,000
We were playing the Mortal Kombat 3 Ultimate

797
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
The arcade one that's on

798
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Or was on Xbox Live that's not there anymore

799
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
So we were kind of having fun just playing some of those old games

800
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
And it's neat because you can kind of see how far along

801
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
The Xbox Live Arcade really has come

802
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
I mean it really was just a bunch of ports in the beginning

803
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
And some of them weren't done very well

804
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Looking back, now going back and playing

805
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
The Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 I'm kind of like

806
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Well where's the move list in the game?

807
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Or where's you know anything

808
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
It's just literally the ROM

809
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Just dumped and sold on Xbox Live Arcade

810
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
So they have come a ways

811
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
A little bit since then

812
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
And you know I think back to some of the episodes

813
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
We were doing back then and I seem to remember

814
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
We were complaining about that a lot

815
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
That a lot of the releases were just ROMs being dumped

816
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
On Xbox Live Arcade and I think Microsoft tried to fix that

817
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
After the first year or two

818
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
They said okay no more of that

819
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
That's a feature

820
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Well excuse me princess

821
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Not entirely the arcade

822
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
No I get what you're saying though

823
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Yeah well remember we were playing Mortal Kombat 3

824
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
And for some reason

825
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
I could remember Kabal combos

826
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Kabal was the character I used to use in Mortal Kombat all the time

827
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
And I remember how to make him do the spinny thing

828
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
And then punch punch uppercut

829
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Little laser purple pew pew beam

830
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
I could do all that still

831
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Yet when it came to fatality time I couldn't remember how to do it

832
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
So I'm like well let me pause and go to the move list

833
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Let's just pause and reconfigure the buttons

834
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Or quit

835
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
So we had to go on GameFAQs to get the fatality

836
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
But then we were like too lazy to do it

837
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Let's just play something else

838
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Let's play Smash GV

839
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I will say one new game I played this week

840
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
I played a free game that's now available on the Playstation 3

841
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Called Free Realms

842
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Free Realms is a free MMO

843
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
That is available on the Playstation 3

844
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
And that's what they're calling it

845
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
It's a what?

846
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
A freemium MMO

847
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
And you download this 25 meg file

848
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
And first I was like oh shit this thing's small

849
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
This is a small game

850
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Alright so I launch the game

851
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Only to wait and download 700 more megabytes

852
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
So I'm like fine

853
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
It's Playstation home

854
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
So I'll go in the other room and play WoW and then come back in an hour

855
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
So finally I get in there and it's like choose your character

856
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
And you can do little character customizations

857
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
You chose this character

858
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
And I don't need to download that character

859
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
No that was the last time I downloaded

860
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
But you can either be a male or female

861
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
And you can be a human or you can be a fairy

862
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
So of course I rolled a man fairy

863
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Because I figured nobody was going to be playing those in the game

864
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
So it would be kind of funny

865
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
And don't you dare be making jokes

866
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Because I'll beat you

867
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Alright so anyway

868
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
I rolled the character

869
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
You can do a custom name

870
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
But if you do a custom name then it has to go to be approved

871
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,000
So you have to choose a name from this slot machine thing

872
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
They have all these pre-approved names

873
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
A first name like a middle name and a last name

874
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:02,000
I think my name ended up being like Rob like Forest Tree or something

875
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I don't remember something really dumb

876
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
So I went in there whatever

877
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
And then it's just okay

878
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Now you're in free realms have fun

879
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
No tutorial no setup

880
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
No nothing just

881
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Okay here you are

882
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
No tutorial? What is this?

883
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
A paid game?

884
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
So I was like okay well I kind of figured it out I think

885
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Like I went around and figured out how to start mining

886
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
And I was like okay I'm going to mine

887
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
So the mining game is kind of like

888
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
I don't know it's like

889
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Bejeweled but not really

890
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Imagine if the point of Bejeweled was not to swap tiles

891
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
But instead you drew lines

892
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
That matched all the colors that were in a row

893
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
And you had to do like three or more

894
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
There's a game like that on Gaia

895
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
That's the mining game

896
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
It sounds like puzzle quest 2 when you have to pick lock a chest

897
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Or bash open a door there's a sort of

898
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Jewel game

899
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
It's different

900
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
I guess they just put out puzzle pirates on consoles

901
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
I mean seriously

902
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
That's an old school game I miss that game

903
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
That was actually a really rad MMO I want to go back and check that out

904
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Anyway this is about free realms you be quiet

905
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
So I did that and whatever

906
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
So I was doing the quests

907
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
And I noticed that in the quests

908
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
If you did not want to try to find

909
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
The NPC that's the next step of the quest

910
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
You could just hit R2

911
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
And your character would just auto fly there

912
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
I fly because I'm a fairy

913
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
You just auto fly there or whatever

914
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
And okay so I made it really easy

915
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
So I kind of figured it out

916
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
This MMO is really for kids

917
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
It's a kids MMO

918
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
How many people were wandering around like

919
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
LOL want to buy gold or whatever

920
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Nobody was really talking

921
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
You could see other real people

922
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Yeah I guess

923
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Do you have a player or do you have pre-determined things

924
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
That you have to say because it is

925
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
I don't know I didn't try to chat

926
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
I don't want to talk to these people

927
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
I just want to figure out what the game is

928
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
So I gathered

929
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
It is a bunch of minigames

930
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Thrown together to make an MMO

931
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
I don't know if you saw

932
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
There's something called penguin defense

933
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
I love penguins it's like a tower defense game

934
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
And then there's basically every

935
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Facebook-y puzzle game

936
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
99 cent iPhone game is somewhere in here

937
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Which is one of the crafting types

938
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
I don't know if you saw but the guy

939
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
That you know I guess is

940
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
The head of

941
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
The team that made this game or whatever

942
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Is like saying well our game is actually

943
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Really really similar to

944
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Minecraft I'm like

945
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
What? No it was nothing like Minecraft

946
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Really? But apparently like the house building

947
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Or some crap in there is

948
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Similar to Minecraft but not

949
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
You can customize your house but it

950
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Struck me a little more Animal Crossing than it is in Minecraft

951
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
It's not Minecraft he's just stupid

952
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Well and here's the other thing folks

953
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Once I got to like the 4th

954
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Level of mining it was like

955
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Do you want to play more mining?

956
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Become a member today of free realm

957
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
So that was it

958
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
So essentially this MMO is just all these

959
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Little minigames but you can play all the minigames

960
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Up to level 4 and then it's like

961
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Oh you gotta be a member

962
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
So it's sodium 1? Yeah basically

963
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
So I'm sorry that's not a

964
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Free MMO

965
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
A demo of a pay MMO

966
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
This is another

967
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Instance of a game company using deceptive

968
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Terms to market their product

969
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Because a lot of people are probably going to check this out because it's a free MMO

970
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
And I'm here to tell you it is not a free MMO

971
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
It is a demo

972
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Of an MMO and I know what their defense

973
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Would be is that well

974
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Once you capital you can still

975
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Be in the world and you can still talk to

976
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
People and you can still customize your fairy

977
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
And to their defense

978
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
And I hate going to their defense but

979
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Their defense is actually

980
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
A pretty cheap MMO

981
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
$35 for a lifetime membership

982
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
But once again

983
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Why would you want to do that?

984
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Pay 99 cents and get the same games

985
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
On the iPhone it's really the same deal

986
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
$35 for a lifetime membership but there's no reason

987
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
To believe the longevity would be

988
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
More than 2 years before they shut the servers

989
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Down because no one's going to play it

990
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Here's the thing

991
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
I will give it this credit

992
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
I thought it was kind of dopey

993
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Maybe twice and I was like okay I think I've done

994
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Everything there is to do in this game

995
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
I see it more like a kids MMO

996
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
I think that's where they've obviously

997
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Taken a lot of safety precautions

998
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
A lot of it's kind of watered down

999
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
I think this is something more for kids

1000
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
But here is where they screwed it royally

1001
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
There's no tutorial

1002
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
There's nothing to kind of help you

1003
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Understand what you're supposed to do in this game

1004
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
And I think a lot of kids

1005
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Would get really frustrated with it

1006
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
I think this would really have to be

1007
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
I think there's a very specific age range

1008
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
It's probably like 10 to 13 year old girls

1009
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
I think would enjoy Free Realms

1010
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
And maybe some boys but I don't know

1011
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
It just strikes me as more of a girly game

1012
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Because there's not a lot of violence

1013
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
And yes I'm being totally sexist right now

1014
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
But that's really it

1015
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
It's more of a tween game

1016
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Like I could see the Jonas Brothers

1017
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
And Justin Bieber showing up here

1018
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
That's what Free Realms struck me as

1019
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
So that was it

1020
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
That was Free Realms

1021
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
It's free so I guess if you want to check it out

1022
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Go for it but I think you'll get bored of it

1023
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
You just totally made me think of a good porn star name

1024
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
What's that?

1025
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Justine Beaver

1026
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Probably already

1027
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
There probably is one

1028
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Because I thought you said Justin Beaver

1029
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
And I knew you said Bieber

1030
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
But then it made me think of how I was calling him Justine

1031
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
And then Justine Beaver

1032
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Going to our chatroom at chat.orangelaungeradio.com

1033
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Robert M in our chat says

1034
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
I assume Free Realms is the same on the PC

1035
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
As far as the Freemium model

1036
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
I think so

1037
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Yes

1038
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Okay

1039
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
I wasn't really motivated to go check

1040
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
You'll have to excuse me

1041
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
I think this is not necessarily

1042
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Granted it's a way

1043
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
I think it's going to get a lot of exposure to people

1044
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
That might not normally try it

1045
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Because it's integrated with the PlayStation Network

1046
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,000
And it's technically free to start playing it

1047
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,000
But it can also be used as kind of data for them

1048
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Because they're working on a new EverQuest

1049
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
They're working on some other

1050
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
I forget what else

1051
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
There's another IP that they're working on

1052
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
A sequel for

1053
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
That's also an MMO

1054
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
But it'll work on this to see what works

1055
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
What doesn't work

1056
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
And it's a good way

1057
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Imagine if EverQuest came out the next one

1058
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,000
As a free to play type of game

1059
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Or something like that

1060
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
That might have a lot of appeal

1061
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Here's the other kind of interesting thing

1062
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
I just want to throw out there

1063
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
As long as we're talking about MMOs on consoles

1064
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Because there really haven't been a lot of successful ones

1065
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
DC Universe to be determined

1066
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Obviously that one's kind of still new

1067
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Home

1068
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Despite all the smack

1069
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
I'm talking about Free Realms

1070
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
I felt there was more to do in Free Realms

1071
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Than there was to do in Home

1072
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
I kind of felt like the effort that was spent

1073
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Making Free Realms

1074
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Would have been better spent

1075
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Putting minigames into Home

1076
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Or making Home

1077
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Have more of a game element to it

1078
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
I get that Home

1079
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
I guess is supposed to be a little more about multimedia

1080
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
And I don't know

1081
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Maybe more about the chatting and so forth

1082
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Whatever

1083
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
I kind of felt like

1084
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
There was at least some point to Free Realms

1085
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Even if it was one I did not care to delve into further

1086
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Than Home

1087
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Where you log in and it's kind of like

1088
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
If there's not a new world to go explore for five minutes

1089
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
You're kind of like LOL bored by

1090
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
You know?

1091
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
So I don't know

1092
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
It strikes me as odd that

1093
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
And I realize it's a different development team

1094
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Sony's a huge company

1095
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
And Free Realms already existed in some regard on the PC

1096
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
So I mean

1097
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
It just seems weird to me that Home

1098
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
After all these years

1099
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Still I don't see the point of logging in

1100
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
To Home regularly

1101
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
There's nothing for me to really check every day

1102
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
I don't know

1103
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Anyhow

1104
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
That was my gaming week

1105
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Talked a lot about Free Realms

1106
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
And some of the other minigames

1107
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Are there plans or something like that in Free Realms?

1108
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
I think they have guilds

1109
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
But I wouldn't know the first thing

1110
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Can you invite the people to your house?

1111
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Your guild members to your house?

1112
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Honestly Loki I didn't play that far

1113
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
You probably can

1114
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
And that's more people that can come to your house

1115
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
And fucking Home!

1116
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Awesome!

1117
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Way to go Sony!

1118
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Bravo!

1119
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
I am confident in saying though

1120
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
That if there are TVs in Free Realms

1121
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
You can't put videos or pictures on them

1122
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Just like Home

1123
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
I'm pretty confident in saying that

1124
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
So

1125
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
That still doesn't matter

1126
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
If no one can see them

1127
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Only so many people can come to your house

1128
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Sorry sorry

1129
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
If we have any more people in this house

1130
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
It's gonna violate the fire code

1131
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
And the marshal's gonna come down here

1132
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
We don't want any of that stuff

1133
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
You know what I mean?

1134
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Just

1135
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Don't want to mess with that

1136
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Alright let's move on

1137
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
We're gonna get into some actual video game news here

1138
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Of course our chatroom

1139
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
chat.orangelaunchy.com

1140
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
If you want to join us live on this Sunday evening

1141
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Real quick housekeeping

1142
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
I may not be here in a couple weeks

1143
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
So we may have a guest host in a couple weeks

1144
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
I don't know I've talked to the other hosts about that

1145
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
I'm not gonna be here in a couple weeks

1146
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Which week's that?

1147
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Is that the 17th?

1148
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Yes

1149
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Maybe we're not gonna be here at all that week

1150
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Where are you gonna be?

1151
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
I'm not gonna be anywhere

1152
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
But my wife's gonna be somewhere

1153
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Okay gotcha

1154
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
She's going to a wedding

1155
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Well then I'm gonna safely say we are probably not gonna be here at all on the 17th

1156
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Which is in two weeks

1157
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Because that is also the night I need to be out

1158
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
I am going in for Mensa testing though on the 16th

1159
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Which is pretty awesome

1160
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Mensa testing?

1161
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Yes Mensa testing

1162
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
What?

1163
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Okay I have to know more about this

1164
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Why are you taking the Mensa test?

1165
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
It's fun

1166
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Did you just sit there and you were just kind of like watching the Food Network

1167
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
And then suddenly it just dawns on you?

1168
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
I should take the Mensa test

1169
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
I don't even remember what it was

1170
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Somehow I got directed to the test that's on their website

1171
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
And I did really well on that

1172
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
And I've been playing around with their iPhone app

1173
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
And I was just like eh you know this is all good and all

1174
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
But I want to actually try the real test

1175
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,000
And I mean even just looking at what questions

1176
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
I mean obviously the questions in the app aren't necessarily the same questions

1177
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
But they have the similar types of questions

1178
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
I don't see how it's really a valid IQ test

1179
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Because you really only have to be good at answering certain types of questions

1180
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
And that's it

1181
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Only you Loki

1182
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
This is so typical of you on the show

1183
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
You're openly questioning why anyone would want to become a Mensa member

1184
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Yet you're scheduled to take the test

1185
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
No I just want it I just want you know hey

1186
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Listen I just want to try it just for the hell of it

1187
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
And you know hey if I if I'm accepted into it

1188
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Great that's something else to put on my resume

1189
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Whatever it doesn't matter

1190
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
I want to take the Mensa test

1191
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
You should

1192
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
It's 40 bucks

1193
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
40 bucks you got to go to a there's a guy

1194
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
That's how much brain age costs right?

1195
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
There's a guy does it once a month down in Dixon

1196
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
And you just go down there and you go take the test

1197
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
It's an hour and a half and that's it

1198
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
I don't think Rob should take it

1199
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Why? Because then I'm gonna fail and I'm gonna cry

1200
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Is that why?

1201
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:31,000
If you pass whatever sort of weird totally irrational opinion you ever have in your life

1202
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Politically or for anything else

1203
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Well I'm a member of Mensa so I think maybe that my opinion

1204
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Listen all you got to be

1205
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Is a bit more important than yours

1206
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
All you have to be good at

1207
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,000
I mean it's seriously it's mostly math and it's mostly pattern finding

1208
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:48,000
So if you can find patterns and kind of think little you know a little bit out of the box I guess

1209
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
That's it you'll be fine

1210
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:56,000
And once again I still don't understand how it's really a valid

1211
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Whatever though I'll take it I'll take the test

1212
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:04,000
I probably won't you know quality because you have to be in the 98th percentile of the United States

1213
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
In order to you know be accepted in there

1214
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
So I'd assume that's probably close to getting everything correctly

1215
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Many years ago I went on a date with a guy who was in Mensa and he had the magazine on his table

1216
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Like you know it was one of those like you know coffee table discussion pieces

1217
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
I always thought

1218
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Well okay let me put it this way like if you join Mensa and stuff they have a bunch of different functions to get out

1219
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Nothing sounded interesting at all

1220
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Is there like a Mensa prom?

1221
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:33,000
I don't know about that they have dating though like a dating thing you can date other Mensa members

1222
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:41,000
It's stupid but it'd be cool to put on like you know to get the little you know award or whatever the hell they have

1223
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:46,000
They're all hey you've been accepted in you know that'd be kind of cool but you know beyond

1224
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Do I really want to be like a functioning member? Fuck that

1225
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
I want to be a member of that society

1226
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Well now are you gonna get excommunicated from Mensa if any of the members here at this program?

1227
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Eh no

1228
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Well I've had um I've used to get letters all the time to go take the test

1229
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,000
I never wanted to do it because I thought it was stupid and pretentious

1230
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
All these fucking smart people I'm just sitting here going

1231
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:14,000
If you can bring your Mensa card to like Coldstone and get a buck off it's like yeah hell yeah

1232
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Free side of pancakes at Denny's because fucking Mensa card hell yeah

1233
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Smart people got it going on

1234
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Yeah is Mensa like AAA will they come change my tire?

1235
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,000
I think it's like AAA

1236
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,000
I don't know so we'll see we'll see what ends up happening there

1237
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:37,000
I probably won't pass it I mean because there's there's a certain type of question from from playing the game

1238
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,000
There's a certain type of question that stumps me usually

1239
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
It's because it's a lot of it and they only do certain types

1240
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:49,000
It's a few rows of numbers and at the very end there's you know there's four rows of four

1241
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:53,000
And you're supposed to figure out what the pattern is between all of them

1242
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:58,000
And a lot of it has to do okay well it's this number times this number with the digits reversed added together

1243
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:03,000
You know minus this times this and you're supposed to figure it out basically you have a minute of questions

1244
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:08,000
So you have to figure out this really ridiculous you know pattern in that time

1245
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:13,000
And a lot of times I'm unable to do it really quickly

1246
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Although I've gone back though and actually looked at some of these and go okay so that's how they're doing it

1247
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:21,000
And you find you know I don't know if it's breaking the test or anything

1248
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,000
And you find there's certain patterns to the way they ask questions and stuff

1249
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:29,000
And okay I got to look for these types of things up there it is and way you go

1250
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:35,000
So I don't know it's it just sounds interesting a challenge or something I don't know

1251
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Well I'm busy this month but if you if you go next month let me know I'll go

1252
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Yeah it's on the 16th this month

1253
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Wow that's a horrible day I can't do that day

1254
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Okay

1255
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Maybe next month all right Randy's in our chat room at chat.orangelandraday.com

1256
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:51,000
And says sky at the Mensa test this is like brain age right this is me at the Mensa test

1257
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Red, yellow, blue

1258
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
It's really

1259
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Blue

1260
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
A big

1261
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Bro

1262
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
It's really a big IQ test

1263
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Yeah

1264
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
That's all it is

1265
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,000
I know I wasn't gifted and talented when I was a kid that counts for something right

1266
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Right

1267
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Yeah

1268
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
I can get a dollar off at Coldstone right all right

1269
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Akuma JP in our chat room says just show them your boobs and that's it pass

1270
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
I don't I don't know if that would work

1271
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Yeah

1272
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:22,000
I don't think that's how it works all right anyhow let's move on actually get into some gaming news tonight

1273
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
All right

1274
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Mensa talk was way better than talking about the Twitter and the Facebook and all that

1275
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:33,000
I can just picture our mailbag now though filling up with emails you don't understand Mensa you're very rude

1276
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:40,000
No I understand it completely I'm just you know I want to become a member but I want to become a

1277
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
You just want a gold star next to your name

1278
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Okay I want to become a non-participating member of Mensa is that is that too much to ask

1279
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:54,000
I just want to be on the roster I don't necessarily want to go to the meetings I don't want to attend some Mensa conference

1280
00:43:54,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Don't care I don't care about talking about political issues I just want the damn you know badge or whatever

1281
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Just put it on your resume

1282
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Exactly

1283
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
All right how about gaming news video games hello

1284
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:12,000
All right well I guess I should be sad about this but uh Mega Man universe has been canceled

1285
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:20,000
That's right it's the game that was basically kind of a remade Mega Man 2 with some customizable characters

1286
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:28,000
And user created levels and really didn't look that great in my opinion but some people were really gung-ho about it

1287
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:38,000
It's canceled too bad so sad their decision I guess was caused by various circumstances that's such a detailed explanation

1288
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:48,000
And of course they're saying that maybe that has to do with the departure of the Mega Man creator and you know the universe lead designer Kenji Inafune

1289
00:44:48,000 --> 00:45:04,000
So I don't know it it just looked like Mega Man powered up just you know on PC or whatever Xbox Live Arcade now with like ooh it's character Mega Man you know

1290
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Interesting idea but I mean they could

1291
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:17,000
It looked interesting to me so of course I'm a little bit disappointed that it got canceled but at the same time if the game really did suck then they did the right thing

1292
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:25,000
You know and it's tough to say that because you know I'm excited about the prospect of a new Mega Man game but even I have to admit it was a little weird when they had that trailer with Ryu in it

1293
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:30,000
And like you know suddenly the other Capcom characters are in Mega Man universe it's like what the fuck is this game

1294
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:38,000
No it would have been cool though if they had all that stuff but see here's my problem is it's basically remade Mega Man they had remade Mega Man 2 levels

1295
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:47,000
If it's Mega Man universe it should be all the fucking games all of the levels all of the bosses you know something like that where you can have your customized character but you're fighting

1296
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:55,000
You know how I don't even know how many you know boss characters it would be but just like you know almost a hundred you know different characters

1297
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Well remember when we only knew the title and nothing else that's what most people were speculating it was is that oh Mega Man universe is finally gonna be that clusterfuck game

1298
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Yeah it would be really awesome like okay well let's see what you know this weapon does to this character from a different game you know and stuff like that

1299
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:21,000
I mean it actually if I remember correctly I think Mega Man 2 did have that kind of in when you're going through the Wily stages where they have the old you know one characters and you have to figure out what weapons did what

1300
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:30,000
I don't believe the one character's ever showed up in two it's the two characters showed up in three you had to replay the stages in the corner stages in three I remember that it's weird

1301
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Got it okay I was close anyways but yeah something like that it's just they're not gonna do that because because he just it's like giving away too much I guess

1302
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Oh well too bad not coming out but we're still getting Mega Man Legends 3 right yeah it's still be supposed to be coming out of that 3DS at some point

1303
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:59,000
One reason to own a 3DS I suppose I am very looking forward to that Legends was awesome

1304
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Alright well some news going on with the Xbox there is a new dashboard apparently on the way and there's a preview that was being rolled out

1305
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Major Nelson had put out the call on his blog that there is going to be another Xbox 360 I guess beta test if you will they call it a preview program it's basically a beta test

1306
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Where you know they did this a little while ago with the new experience I think they did it again with the new Netflix and all that

1307
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Yeah I did it last time when they have that and I didn't do it this time for a couple reasons well mainly because I hated having to update my system all the damn time

1308
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Because it would be like oh you got another update oh you got another update and you know all these updates rolling out a few times a day and it was annoying

1309
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:49,000
And seriously not worth my getting a copy of Halo Reach even if it is in this new format and I am kind of curious to see what the new format is

1310
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,000
I don't know it's just not really worth it

1311
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Well what's also interesting about this beta test program everybody is getting a free copy of Halo Reach with it so you know there is definitely something in it for folks here

1312
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:05,000
And the reason why it's coming with Halo Reach is because there is a new disk format that's basically being beta tested with this whole thing

1313
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:15,000
And that you know a lot of people are kind of assuming oh well this is to basically prevent copy you know don't copy that floppy and the piracy all that stuff this is there to update that

1314
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:21,000
And that is probably true that's a big part of this as well but apparently there is something else going on

1315
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:29,000
This is from a website called Digital Foundry apparently saying that the new disk format that Microsoft is going to put in this new Xbox update

1316
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:36,000
It's going to give an extra gigabyte of the disk back so they are basically creating a new gig of space on the disk

1317
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:41,000
I don't know if that's like maybe using the outside layer or maybe some type of copy protection they were using

1318
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:45,000
They had a video partition or something like that or a certain partition that was in there

1319
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Actually it was kind of weird I think it was either the security partition or like the video partition

1320
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Here it is there was over a gigabyte dedicated to a DVD video partition that also contained anti-piracy security sectors

1321
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:05,000
So that is going to be drastically reduced or admitted completely so it will free up more space on the disk

1322
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:11,000
What this will mean in the immediate future I don't know but it does mean an extra gig can be packed in

1323
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:17,000
That would only seem to really affect I mean I don't know like a lot of RPGs that go beyond a disk have just gone multi-disk

1324
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Like Lost Odyssey had fucking four disks

1325
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Yeah but there is certain games that maybe because it is really expensive to put out multi-disk games

1326
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:32,000
For games that are getting close to that and they have to compress all their stuff or they have to cut out things because there is not room on a single disk

1327
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Or whatever it is that they are trying to put out this way it gives them at least an extra gig of space to work with

1328
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:44,000
And not every company fills up at this completely so it would make sense and really they could get rid of that stupid video partition

1329
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Because who cares? Okay so I pop this in my DVD player because I am an idiot and it comes up with some Xbox logo

1330
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
That doesn't say that this is

1331
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Oh is that what happens? I have never thought to put an Xbox 360 disk in a regular DVD player

1332
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:07,000
So it is that video partition and so it will go oh this is an Xbox disk you have to play it in your Xbox 360

1333
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Well how about you just don't do that and then all it will do is it can't re-disk

1334
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Or just have a picture

1335
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Hey idiot this is for an Xbox 360, bye

1336
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
It could just be a static picture

1337
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Well it pretty much is a picture I am surprised that it takes a gigabyte of space for that

1338
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:25,000
I mean it seems like an awful lot for just a little picture

1339
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:33,000
SSJ100Matt in our chatroom at chat.orangelandradi.com is asking so will these free copies of Halo Reach go towards its overall sales numbers

1340
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Think maybe throwing back a little bit to when they were giving Guitar Hero Van Halen free with Guitar Hero 5 remember that

1341
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Yes but it doesn't really matter at this point anyways because I mean the sales of it has probably dropped quite a bit

1342
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:48,000
SolarFlare in our chatroom says it will still be behind Blu-Ray though, interesting point

1343
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:56,000
You know that is one thing that holds the Xbox 360 back a little bit you know we do have a lot of companies that want to port their games to both systems

1344
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:03,000
So I bet there's a lot of games out there on the PS3 that aren't really realizing their full potential of Blu-Ray

1345
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:08,000
And this will not just help the 360 games expand but I think it will help the PS3 ports expand too right

1346
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:20,000
No I mean a little bit maybe but I don't really think it's going to make a huge difference because if those companies are holding back their ports just because of space issues

1347
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Or if they're porting it to multiple systems using the same assets then it's not a huge deal I don't think

1348
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:35,000
If they really wanted to they could just uncompress everything for the Blu-Ray but with Blu-Ray the whole problem was that it's slow

1349
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Especially that data on the inside is really slow compared to the stuff on the edge of the disk

1350
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:54,000
So it's just I don't know I don't think it's going to make a huge difference there's not a lot of games that utilize all the space on there as well

1351
00:51:54,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Let me close on this question here for this story, SolarFlare in our chatroom asks are they trying to make time to having to break out the next gen console

1352
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:07,000
You know we have noticed a lot of in this generation of games and you know part of it you can blame on the recession

1353
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Part of it is this whole 10 year cycle or whatever they're talking about but you have noticed that especially the 360 has had its life extended

1354
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:19,000
A couple times here with Kinect and now maybe this is another step to try and breathe another year or two into it

1355
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:25,000
It probably is just to help the developers out a little bit because you know there's space issues with you know what's on the disk

1356
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:32,000
And it's it's just probably something they looked at and go do we really need this no okay let's get rid of it then we can free up all the space for our developers

1357
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:37,000
I'm sure they would dig that so you know that's probably what it's all about

1358
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Alright well let's move on with some more news I think DarkSakura has some more Xbox news for us

1359
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:51,000
I do if I don't drop my mic this actually has to do with the live indie games issue on Xbox live about the ratings

1360
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:57,000
You know we had said that we had a feeling of the ratings were kind of fixed you know that they might have been manipulated

1361
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:08,000
And it turns out that it actually might be the XNA creators club excuse me actually tweeted that and I quote

1362
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:15,000
We are investigating a possible misuse of ratings on XBLG titles will announce more information here as it develops

1363
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:24,000
So basically it's been coming to people's attention that ratings have gone from you know really high to just dropping drastically

1364
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,000
And so they're fairly certain that there's manipulation behind it

1365
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:38,000
So is the most so if the fraud is true is it being used to bolster the ratings of games that maybe are terrible or to lower stuff that competitors don't get by

1366
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:46,000
It wasn't necessarily that they were being well they were being manipulated but it wasn't by the whim of a certain publisher

1367
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Basically it was that one lacrosse game that was on there they tweeted their fellows hey give us a five star rating

1368
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Well the people that are fans of the game also took it upon themselves to rate the other games one star that were in the area

1369
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:11,000
So they you know inadvertently created like you know ratings fixing almost but it's just because there's no real system in place to where you have to purchase the game in order to rate it

1370
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,000
And that kind of stuff

1371
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Oh yeah I guess that's true

1372
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
So you can just rate it regardless

1373
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Yeah it seems to be highly unfair that someone should be able to rate something that they haven't played so

1374
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Yeah because I thought that you you know spent your one to three bucks or your two to four hundred whatever microsoft space bucks

1375
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:36,000
I'm like wow this is terrible and then you can give it two stars after you've at least played the demo or bought it but I guess not

1376
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Yeah

1377
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
You can just do what you want

1378
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Well they're looking into it apparently so maybe they'll realize that was one big oversight

1379
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:50,000
To be honest doesn't iTunes have that same problem I mean I could go in and rate podcasts to one that I've never listened to

1380
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Well not with the apps I think that you're given I think you can only rate them after you've used them

1381
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Perhaps

1382
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,000
I know that if you delete an app it asks you to rate it

1383
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Yeah

1384
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
So

1385
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Which by the way you should leave Orange Knobs Radio a five star review on iTunes

1386
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Do it

1387
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Yes we actually had a couple nice ones this past week so thank you guys for doing that really appreciate it

1388
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:18,000
That kind of stuff does help because when we get more five star reviews on iTunes it kind of like bumps you up in the listing and you know just helps us get more exposure

1389
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Add more people to our chat room and make it a bigger party on Sunday nights

1390
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,000
We need to be as exposed as Malina's boobs

1391
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,000
If not more so

1392
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Yeah

1393
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
That's right alright moving on Loki

1394
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Yeah

1395
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Oh by the way the people doing this total dicks I forgot to say that earlier

1396
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Another cancellation story this isn't a big surprise because this has been delayed forever and I remember playing it back a couple

1397
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:52,000
God how many E3's ago was that that I actually played this but Sony online entertainment has confirmed that they have cancelled the agency

1398
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
It will not be coming out

1399
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:05,000
You know it was delayed forever it was a spy MMO kind of a cool little game but oh well

1400
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Man I'm just keeping sad trombone open in a window tonight because there's a lot of just cancellation news

1401
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:27,000
Kind of alluding to what I was talking about before when we were talking about Free Realms they're also saying that the company is discontinuing production of the title to focus on developing resources on delivering two new MMOs based on its renowned PlanetSide and EverQuest properties

1402
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Which while also maintaining its current portfolio of online games so you know maybe a new free to play you know EverQuest because

1403
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:43,000
I'm surprised just a straight up port of the first EverQuest game hasn't shown up on PS3 yet

1404
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Because there's still shit tons of people playing old school EverQuest there's what like 20 something expansions it's crazy

1405
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,000
But you know people invested a lot in that game

1406
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:59,000
It's the same reason that it's so important what Blizzard does next with their next MMO because you know this titan thing or whatever it is they're doing

1407
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:06,000
They have to be very careful because they don't want to cannibalize wow but they might you know it's weird

1408
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:11,000
I got an email a couple weeks ago from Ultima Online which I think I demoed way back in the day

1409
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:20,000
So you know yeah new loyalty mount for like as if you have a concurrent subscription like City of Heroes does that for how long you've been paying for the game

1410
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:23,000
For Ultima Online when did that come out?

1411
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:26,000
I was one of the first MMOs period

1412
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:30,000
It was probably like 99 it was a long time ago

1413
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Yeah it was like 12 or 13 year loyalty mount

1414
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Okay yeah so if they're still around then so is the EverQuest people yeah

1415
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Boy oh boy that is and yeah I think it's when you invest so much time into something it's hard to walk away from it

1416
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:58,000
And for me that's a lot of wow it's hard for me I was really interested in DC Universe but I've been having a hard time saying I'm gonna really invest this time in DC Universe

1417
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Because all my friends are on wow this is tough

1418
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Just type a slash played and see

1419
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Oh cry all right Spassinator in our chat room says the agency being canceled how the flying fuck can anyone not see that coming

1420
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Well I don't know I don't know if I would say I saw it coming I did notice it was an awfully long development cycle

1421
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:27,000
But MMOs on consoles have just become so unpredictable like and most of the news is really bad

1422
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:34,000
And I don't like what are they doing wrong why why do consoles just seem to not be able to get MMOs

1423
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:41,000
The lone exception being probably DC Universe maybe Final Fantasy 11 but that game is a little old now

1424
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:46,000
So what is it about consoles that MMOs just aren't fucking working

1425
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:56,000
I think that games on consoles are more serialized that they have a beginning and an end even if it's a God of War or an RPG that takes 80 hours to beat

1426
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:02,000
You get to the ending you play it again you get the alternate ending and you're done and you move on to the next title

1427
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Console games is all about how much I want to say like it like it's an assembly line of just how many games you can churn through in a certain amount of time

1428
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:13,000
But you know you you buy certain amount of games in a year and you want to get through them all

1429
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Whereas an MMO is really open-ended you never get to the end of wow

1430
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:25,000
And that's sort of the culture or the attitude that piece that more is more appropriate for PCs if that makes sense

1431
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:36,000
I'm with you to a point but then I ask what about Halo where it thrives on it's at least you know the older games especially to thrived on online

1432
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Which didn't really have a beginning in the end maybe maybe a match had a beginning and an end I don't know

1433
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Well yeah those are broken up into matches

1434
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:50,000
Because I guess sports are somehow different and Halo is kind of like a sport IDK

1435
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Yeah I don't know Game Guru in our chat room flat out says because it is not wow

1436
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:04,000
I don't know you know as much you know I'm a big supporter of wow although I don't always agree with everything Blizzard does

1437
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:11,000
But you know I think there's room for more than one you know a game like DC Universe I don't think it's a failure

1438
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:14,000
I don't know how that game has been selling I think it's been doing okay

1439
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:20,000
But right now okay in the console universe is better than anything else right now

1440
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,000
Than nokay?

1441
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Yeah than nokay

1442
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:27,000
Eve Online is still kicking doesn't have wow's numbers but it's definitely got its market share

1443
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,000
There's people still doing Perfect World

1444
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Final Fantasy 11 still has supporters

1445
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Guild Wars

1446
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Shit Ultima Online and EverQuest still have lots of people to play

1447
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
Lineage 2 still a fucking huge game

1448
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
That's really big in Korea

1449
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,000
Yeah just not here in the US

1450
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:51,000
So let's see going to our chat room again Brad from Pod Culture says wouldn't Phantasy Star Online count kinda

1451
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Well I thought it was cool that Sega actually let people transfer their characters to private servers

1452
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:05,000
That was cool and so it was like well we have to close it but I know there's still people doing it

1453
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:08,000
And there was Phantasy Star Universe was going on

1454
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Yeah true but Phantasy Star Universe I don't think was ever

1455
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,000
I know people who are still playing it

1456
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Really? I just wouldn't think

1457
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
Although by people I mean Julie

1458
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,000
One person

1459
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Phantasy Star Online back in the Dreamcast especially and don't get me wrong I love Phantasy Star Online my god

1460
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:30,000
It really just kinda like set the tone I think in a way for MMOs and I think a lot of MMOs wouldn't exist today if it wasn't for PSO

1461
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
I love PSO

1462
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:36,000
I don't know like in a way PSO isn't even really an MMO to me

1463
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:40,000
No it's more like you run these rooms okay you're done

1464
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,000
Yeah

1465
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
You hang out with your friends making weird emoticons

1466
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Yeah

1467
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,000
And then you dance

1468
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:49,000
PSO always felt a lot like Diablo to me for some weird reason

1469
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
The whole random dungeon crawling

1470
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:56,000
I actually I really started liking PSO when I started playing online

1471
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
I'm sorry on the computer

1472
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:04,000
You know what I think really hurt PSO you know what really really hurt that franchise more than anything I think

1473
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,000
PSU

1474
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:09,000
No I would say it was before that I would say it was the GameCube game

1475
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Because Nintendo just aborted online support

1476
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:25,000
Literally told Sega sure we'll help you out with this you know MMO thing and put out this broadband adapter or anything and then Nintendo just basically said ah fuck it

1477
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,000
LOLJK

1478
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:32,000
No here's what I think was even worse the Dreamcast version in the US no online play

1479
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:36,000
You had to do this little thing to manipulate it to get it to play online

1480
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,000
Because it wouldn't support the broadband adapter

1481
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Yeah I imported that or I did something where

1482
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Yeah I could play the Dreamcast one online

1483
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,000
I had the ethernet

1484
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,000
I had the modem though

1485
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Well no we had that too it was it was like it was something that you had to manipulate in the menu

1486
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:58,000
The DNS I think or that your IP you had to put in something to force it to go out through the ethernet

1487
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,000
Yeah

1488
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,000
You had to do something to it to get it to work

1489
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:05,000
I don't remember having that problem I just remember it working ah whatever it's been so long

1490
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:15,000
Well I guess and also going back to the agency thematically a spy MMO I don't know something about MMOs is you have to even in fantasy star online you're not killing literal dragons

1491
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:21,000
But it's whimsical fantasy sci-fi you know no one wants to get together with their five friends and smuggle microfiche

1492
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:27,000
Matrix online ended anything that I've noticed well the city of heroes is still going Star Trek online is still going strong

1493
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:31,000
I love Star Trek online in fact I need to pay for a month but

1494
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:35,000
Yeah I don't I don't think MMO has to be swords and dragons and mystical stuff

1495
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,000
It has to be fantasy

1496
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Yeah it's just I think the other that's a tried and true method that's an established formula that's a formula that's working right now

1497
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:47,000
That's WoW's formula in a way I think

1498
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
But now they have goblins with motorcycles

1499
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:57,000
I think we haven't really seen the other type but then again Eve online is not is a space game DC Universe not really dragons

1500
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:04,000
Star Trek online totally different thing but Star Trek's a whole separate fandom too you know like

1501
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:14,000
Well and the fact that they're getting so much right in Star Trek online they're really playing to continuity fans and sort of getting

1502
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:20,000
I mean I hated enterprise but they are incorporating the better parts of enterprise into the game

1503
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:28,000
And it's got something for the fans that's the big thing is that the people that are playing Star Trek online are Star Trek fans

1504
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Alright let's move on from MMO chat we're running a little long because of MMO chat let's do some other quick stories here

1505
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:40,000
I got a story about GameStop and GameStop apparently has bought absorbed some more companies

1506
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:47,000
They bought spawn labs and they've also bought a company called impulse now what the hell did these things do

1507
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:58,000
Okay spawn labs they did this high def box set that apparently I guess it sounds to me a lot like the whole online system

1508
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:03,000
It's kind of similar to that so that's you know one thing they've absorbed and then they also got impulse

1509
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:10,000
Which apparently is going to have three parts to it which is the client the impulse client which you can use to download games

1510
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:15,000
The reactor which is like DRM management and copy protection and all of that

1511
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Letting the developers do achievement friends list and all the kind of like steam xbox

1512
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,000
Sounds like a steam clone

1513
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:26,000
And then impulse publisher which is real time reporting and management tools

1514
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:33,000
GameStop has bought these companies so in a way I sort of see this as them thinking ahead a little bit

1515
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:40,000
Because these companies have more to do with online distribution and something that isn't so much the stores

1516
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:45,000
You know they did not buy stores in this acquisition well they did but it's a different type you know

1517
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:50,000
So I have a feeling they are thinking ahead as to this whole how do we counter digital distribution

1518
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
They're absorbing more and more into their collective

1519
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:58,000
A little bit yes but you know it doesn't mean all the mall stores are going to shut down next week

1520
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:04,000
But I don't know this digital distribution thing if I was kind of in this GameStop industry I'd be a little freaked out right now

1521
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:09,000
Well maybe not right this second but you know five years from now this could be

1522
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:13,000
Just makes me think of Blockbuster and Netflix when Netflix first came out

1523
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:18,000
Is this you know Johnny come lately by mail oh who's going to use that

1524
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:25,000
Blockbuster hopped on that bandwagon but they did it too late but I think they hopped on it early enough to save them past Hollywood's demise

1525
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Right so I feel like GameStop you know and again I don't mean to like panic people or whatever this is years away

1526
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:35,000
You know these things happening but GameStop buying this I think they're trying to kind of put themselves in a position

1527
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:40,000
Where they are like Blockbuster got in on it early that's what this seems like to me

1528
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,000
They're setting up a safety net

1529
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,000
Yeah

1530
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:49,000
That we know because if I don't have any details because I really don't think I know any more store managers

1531
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:55,000
But from what I've noticed I'll go into a GameStop you know and it'll be dead empty

1532
01:06:55,000 --> 01:07:00,000
There'll be no one in there and I think that it's just first of all a sign of the economy and another thing

1533
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:06,000
And this this is actually I'm not going to go into it because it's a little bit more on the cycle psychology level

1534
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:13,000
But I think that people are becoming more isolated wanting to do more things from home

1535
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:17,000
Not wanting to go out amongst people you know what I mean

1536
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:24,000
That that's why online services have become so popular you know people need to get out of the house

1537
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:29,000
See I have to play devil's advocate here though a little bit the one by his house in South San Francisco always packed

1538
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
The one in that mall what is that mall called?

1539
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,000
Well yeah but that's in the mall

1540
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,000
ceremony

1541
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,000
I'm talking about strip mall places

1542
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,000
Oh okay

1543
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:36,000
They're dead

1544
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
I don't really go to a lot of those yeah

1545
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:42,000
Well Dan will randomly let's go buy this store number because he knows all the store numbers

1546
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,000
Uh-huh

1547
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:48,000
I'll be like okay well which one's that oh it's the one over here then why didn't you just say that was the one over there

1548
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,000
So

1549
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:53,000
Let's see go into our chat I'm going to chat on orangeontraday.com

1550
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:56,000
SolarFlare says they're going to have to do some good stuff to compete with steam

1551
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:01,000
I think that's what part of all this is is to really align themselves in a way where they can

1552
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:09,000
Maybe they'll start doing this thing in the store where you know buy the copy in the store and get some type of digital download thing

1553
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:13,000
The free costume or you know something extra maybe that's kind of where they're going

1554
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:14,000
We'll see

1555
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:17,000
All right moving on dark soccer what do you got for us

1556
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:20,000
Well we have some news out of Japan

1557
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:23,000
Oh which is where video games come from

1558
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Oh and it's a new Super Mario Brothers Wii arcade cabinet that's being developed by Capcom

1559
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:37,000
Yeah it's Super Mario Brothers Wii Coin World

1560
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:42,000
It's a four player game where you earn medals by participating in mini games so kind of

1561
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,000
It's Mario Party

1562
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:47,000
Kind of Mario Party-ish I say ish

1563
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
Not too much running and jumping

1564
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:56,000
And it actually is on Capcom of Japan's website there's a trailer and everything

1565
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:01,000
And I'm just like why is Capcom doing it but then again Capcom is

1566
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:06,000
Nintendo hasn't ever really been much in the arcade scene except for the play choice

1567
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
Oh that was years ago though

1568
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
Arcades are not even the same thing now

1569
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:15,000
In fact I more think this is news worthy as oh arcade games are still popular somewhere in the world

1570
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:19,000
But I think it's actually neat that they've got that relationship with Capcom to do it

1571
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:22,000
Because Capcom does put out good quality

1572
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:26,000
Who did the Mario Kart sit down driver game that's at

1573
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:30,000
Namco because you can play as Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man in that

1574
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,000
All right yes I thought

1575
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
So yeah Namco did that

1576
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:36,000
So yeah it's not totally unheard of that's a good example

1577
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:40,000
It's not totally unheard of that other companies might get to do Nintendo stuff in the arcade

1578
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:45,000
One of my favorite and most underrated arcade machines ever F-Zero

1579
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:48,000
Which is a fucking amazing game

1580
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:53,000
Actually the arcade machine's biggest problem was it only had six freaking tracks in it

1581
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
And you could unlock them all at home

1582
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:59,000
There's one of the guys that's in the Playstation hacking scene or whatever

1583
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:02,000
He's kind of gotten out of it now but know what his thing is now

1584
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:05,000
He's dumping the stuff for the Triforce system

1585
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,000
Nice

1586
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:09,000
Yeah of course the Triforce system was the F-Zero game

1587
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
Because that was Nintendo, Sega, and Namco

1588
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,000
This looks really fun

1589
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,000
All on one

1590
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:18,000
It's like you take a different corner and everyone's got different minigames

1591
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
But it looks really cool

1592
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:23,000
I'll link the website to everyone in the chatroom

1593
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:26,000
You know how that would make millions here in the US

1594
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,000
Tickets

1595
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,000
Is have it spit tickets

1596
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,000
Yeah

1597
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:35,000
Gee I wonder if this will be part of New Super Mario Brothers Wii Dose

1598
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,000
Maybe

1599
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
You never know

1600
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:45,000
Alright let's move on, travel the world, look at some release dates of actual stuff coming to a store near you

1601
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:51,000
We're in April now so now that we've passed the fiscal end of years for a lot of companies

1602
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:54,000
There's not a lot of companies putting out stuff

1603
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,000
So here's what we've got

1604
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:59,000
Carnival Games, Monkey See Monkey Do for the Xbox 360 and Kinect

1605
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
That's coming out this week

1606
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:05,000
Karaoke Revolution Glee volume 2

1607
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:08,000
Coming out game only and with a mic

1608
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
Sorry I just burped

1609
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
Sorry

1610
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:16,000
Remington Super Slam Hunting Alaska on the Wii

1611
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
Starring Sarah Palin

1612
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
Except not really

1613
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:24,000
And then on the 3DS a week from today

1614
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:28,000
Tom Clancy Splinter Cell 3D

1615
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:34,000
And I believe Raven Grab is travel through time 3D is also coming out at the same time

1616
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
That's it

1617
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,000
Wow

1618
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,000
Yeah

1619
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
Short week

1620
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Alright

1621
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
As will be much of April

1622
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:44,000
Well

1623
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
SSJ100 Matt says needs more bacon

1624
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:49,000
Let's go to Japan real quick and look at the games coming out there

1625
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:55,000
We have Bullet Soul comes out in Japan this week on the Xbox 360 and Dragon Age Origins Awakening

1626
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:58,000
I imagine it seems like they're behind a little bit

1627
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:02,000
Keep in mind they've got to translate that stuff into Japanese so it is a little bit behind

1628
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
On the Playstation 3 this week

1629
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,000
Nada

1630
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
Going over to some other systems then

1631
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
Taking a look at the Wii

1632
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
Nothing there either

1633
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
In fact not a lot on the horizon for the Wii

1634
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
How about the 3DS in Japan?

1635
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:18,000
Well you got a game called Cubic Ninja comes out this week in Japan

1636
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:23,000
It looks like you move little boxes that have ninja looking graphics on them

1637
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:27,000
And you, I don't know, move them around these stages and make them fall down holes

1638
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
It looks like a puzzle game

1639
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:35,000
Let's say it's a puzzle game, it uses the tilt controls on the 3DS and it is a 3DS game without 3D

1640
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
Is that coming, oh really

1641
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
It's coming out over here in June

1642
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
Just the screenshots that I just so briefly saw

1643
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:46,000
It kind of looked like the yellow blob on the PSP port of the Loco

1644
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,000
Loco Loco?

1645
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
Loco Loco, yeah, looked like that

1646
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:52,000
On the PSP this week, Earth Defense Force 2 portable

1647
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
That might be an interesting lookie

1648
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,000
Awesome

1649
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
Princess Frontier portable, awesome

1650
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:01,000
And then a game called Are You Alice? comes out this week on the PSP

1651
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Hello, are you Alice? No, okay, are you Alice? No, are you Alice?

1652
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
Regular and limited edition

1653
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
This looks to be, it's kind of like based off an anime it looks like

1654
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Kind of like these chapters, looks like kind of like one of those interactive novel type things

1655
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
Because there's regular and limited edition

1656
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,000
It's a dating sim

1657
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,000
Is it really?

1658
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:22,000
I think it is

1659
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
No, this looks too like

1660
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:29,000
If this is a dating sim, no, the woman would not have a sword in a dating sim

1661
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:33,000
Look at it, it's got all that text

1662
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:34,000
Oh boy, alright

1663
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:40,000
And there's some pretty fun, funny hentai ones out there that involve swords and dragons and tentacles

1664
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:43,000
Coming next year from Quadratic Dream

1665
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:44,000
Are you Jason?

1666
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
The side story for Heavy Rain

1667
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:49,000
Are you Jason? No, okay

1668
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:52,000
Are you Jason? Have you seen Jason? Do you know Jason?

1669
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:55,000
That's it for Japanese release dates

1670
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:59,000
Well in the UK, Jack and Squat really

1671
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:03,000
On the 5th is Red Faction Battlegrounds for Xbox 360

1672
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:07,000
And the same thing a day later on the 6th for Playstation 3

1673
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:12,000
And also the Dishwasher Vampire Smile on Xbox 360

1674
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
What the crap is that?

1675
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:20,000
Sounds like the sequel to the Dishwasher, the indie game that ended up being a real arcade release

1676
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:21,000
Oh yeah

1677
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
Sounds like a sequel

1678
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:28,000
There's people in cages and a dude with a big sword

1679
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
That is a sequel to the game

1680
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,000
I would play that

1681
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:34,000
Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys

1682
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
And then the classic game of the week

1683
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:39,000
And we have a pretty big one this week

1684
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
So we'll get to that in just a moment, but first, Loki

1685
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:45,000
I don't know if I can report this story without fear of being sued by Namco

1686
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:46,000
But I'm gonna do it anyways

1687
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:51,000
Namco Bandai has filed for a couple trademarks in the Katamari franchise

1688
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:59,000
Katamari Amore, which is filed under Katamari Amore and Katamari Amore Rolling Whopper

1689
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:03,000
Hopefully nothing to do with Burger King

1690
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:08,000
And I guess hints obviously that they're gonna put out another game in that series

1691
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:13,000
And then of course there's two additional trademark applications for Time Trip and Have a Nice Trip

1692
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:18,000
Not necessarily in the Katamari series, perhaps

1693
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:23,000
But I guess Trip was one of the characters in Enslaved

1694
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
So maybe it's something to do better

1695
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:28,000
Or maybe, heaven forbid, a new IP altogether

1696
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:29,000
I don't know

1697
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:32,000
Maybe, or it's another Katamari game, who knows

1698
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:35,000
Didn't the guy from Namco or whatever

1699
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:36,000
Yeah, he left to make

1700
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
Yeah, he made a pretty

1701
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:41,000
The subtext was pretty clear that he was sick of the franchise after the second one

1702
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:42,000
And he just didn't care anymore

1703
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:45,000
They kept making them anyways, or I should say they kept rehashing them

1704
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:48,000
Oh, I'm still playing Noby Noby Boy

1705
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
Yeah, because that's what he did after Katamari

1706
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:53,000
It's actually fun, people are still doing stuff on Noby Noby Boy

1707
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:57,000
On the phone, and uploading everything to Facebook so that girl will grow

1708
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:08,000
I hope if it's a new Katamari game it is not part of this whole jump the shark that's kind of dominated this last generation of the games

1709
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:13,000
I'm sure we'll have a Katamari game that'll be in 3D that'll be basically the rehash levels again

1710
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
And it's going to be on the 3DS

1711
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
I'm sure that's going to happen eventually because

1712
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:18,000
If it's in 3D I'll throw up

1713
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:22,000
Because that's what they do, and whatever

1714
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:25,000
I don't know, I can't really get excited about this stuff because

1715
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:28,000
Even I bought the last Katamari game that was on 360

1716
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,000
It was just kind of, eh

1717
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:30,000
The 360 one was bad

1718
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
The PS3 one's alright

1719
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:37,000
The PS3 one's okay, but the problem with the PS3 one is that it's basically the same stuff from the first two games

1720
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:38,000
Mixed together

1721
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:39,000
It's kind of like

1722
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:43,000
The Katamari game on the PS3 is like the Wilson Phillips greatest hits album

1723
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:46,000
They only fucking had two CDs, right?

1724
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:50,000
So there's not a lot to compile a greatest hits album from

1725
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:54,000
Daft Punk has the greatest hits and I think they only had what, three albums?

1726
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,000
Yeah

1727
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:59,000
I guess it's kind of like that then, I don't know

1728
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:04,000
You know, surely you've seen those one hit wonders that have these greatest hits CDs

1729
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:08,000
When I'm discovered and released an album, I'm just gonna call it Greatest Hits

1730
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
Like your first album will just be called Greatest Hits?

1731
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,000
My first album will be Greatest Hits

1732
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:14,000
My second one will be, well these are better than the last ones

1733
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:18,000
You know the DDR band Erotic, which of course

1734
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,000
Greatest Tits

1735
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
Yeah, they had an album called Greatest Tits

1736
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
I like that name

1737
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:27,000
Moving on, one more story for me for this part of the show

1738
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
PlayStation Rewards

1739
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:30,000
Remember this?

1740
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:33,000
It was a beta program that happened last year

1741
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
And the beta is now ending

1742
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:41,000
And this PlayStation Rewards program was supposed to be launching for all the PlayStation folks in the next month

1743
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:45,000
But I guess Sony has decided based on what they've learned throughout the beta test

1744
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:48,000
They do not want to roll this program out to the public yet

1745
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:53,000
So yeah, they're gonna say, well we thank loyal and devoted customers with innovative offerings

1746
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
But yeah, it's not happening right now

1747
01:17:55,000 --> 01:18:00,000
In fact, they're thinking it's been delayed indefinitely

1748
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:04,000
Now the PlayStation Rewards program was supposed to have these quests

1749
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:07,000
And other things that go with it

1750
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:08,000
It was supposed to be quests

1751
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
Did you get real tangible stuff from this I think?

1752
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:14,000
You could get pro or legendary status from this

1753
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:17,000
And I think you got free PlayStation Pulse

1754
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
Or move things, I don't know

1755
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
You get little trinkets from it

1756
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:24,000
Yeah, they've decided to delay this indefinitely so far

1757
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:28,000
So I don't know, maybe they'll come out and say they changed their mind at E3

1758
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:32,000
But a quote from a PlayStation representative

1759
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:36,000
After careful consideration and evaluation following the PlayStation Rewards beta

1760
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:39,000
We have decided not to roll out the program to the public at this time

1761
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:43,000
We remain committed to providing the best overall consumer experience for our users

1762
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:47,000
And we will be refocusing our efforts in the near future to further developing PlayStation Plus

1763
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
And our other network services

1764
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:54,000
So maybe becoming a PlayStation Plus member is all the reward they want to give you

1765
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
That's what it sounds like anyway

1766
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:59,000
So if you want rewards, you gotta pay for them

1767
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:03,000
They're like, wait, we can charge people for these rewards

1768
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:04,000
Awesome

1769
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:07,000
Yeah, that's not a reward really, that's a sale

1770
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
That's buying something

1771
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:10,000
Yeah

1772
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
Alright, well let's get to the part of the show

1773
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:16,000
And you shouldn't really have to bribe somebody to use the different services on there

1774
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
That's what I'm saying

1775
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:23,000
Okay, now let's get to the part of the show where we take a stroll down memory lane

1776
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:28,000
And revisit a classic video game from the archives in Dark Sakura

1777
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
This one's really classic, it's kinda moldy

1778
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:33,000
Yeah, in her quest to find the classic game of the week

1779
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:37,000
That she thinks, hey you ungrateful bastard kids, you need to play this game right away

1780
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:38,000
And get off my lawn

1781
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:41,000
Alright, or mow my lawn if you're gonna stand on it

1782
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
Yeah, mow my lawn, seriously, it frickin' needs it

1783
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
Then get off it

1784
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
Alright, Dark Sakura, what is the classic game of the week?

1785
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:51,000
I think there's only one way to introduce that, and that's to play some of the dialogue off

1786
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
Alright, let's see what I can do here

1787
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:56,000
I think I have to fast forward a wee bit in this video to get to the dialogue

1788
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,000
Here you go

1789
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
Wow, what a mansion

1790
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:14,000
I hope this is not Chris's blood

1791
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:18,000
Okay, this is Resident Evil

1792
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:23,000
And I actually did put up a sample of the redone dialogue in the GameCube version

1793
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:26,000
That's so much better, so much better

1794
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
I can probably get to a little bit of that here, let's see

1795
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
What is this place?

1796
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:36,000
Not quite your ordinary house, that's for sure

1797
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
Hey, Wesker, where's Chris?

1798
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:41,000
I bought the GameCube for that

1799
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:42,000
Jill, no

1800
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
You don't wanna go back out there

1801
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
But we've got to be saying the same stuff

1802
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:48,000
What was that?

1803
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:50,000
Chris?

1804
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,000
Anyway

1805
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:52,000
No

1806
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
I hope this is not Chris's blood

1807
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
Master of Unlocking

1808
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:59,000
Maybe you, the Master of Unlocking, can use this

1809
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:00,000
Yeah

1810
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:03,000
Let's see, so it was known as Biohazard in Japan

1811
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:08,000
Which actually, I've got a PlayStation version of Biohazard and I have it on Saturn

1812
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:11,000
But this one is put out by Capcom

1813
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:16,000
And it spawned a legacy still going on today

1814
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:19,000
It was developed by Shinji Mikami

1815
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:24,000
And as of May 2009, it sold 40 million copies

1816
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:29,000
So this was one of the early ones into the survival horror series

1817
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:35,000
And you, it had a full motion intro

1818
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:39,000
But they cut part of the intro for the American one

1819
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:42,000
Because there is a scene where Chris pulls out his Zippo

1820
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:45,000
Lights a cigarette and takes a drag

1821
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:49,000
And then there's another scene where this zombie's head falls off and it looks like Michael Jordan

1822
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
They cut that too

1823
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
Honestly, it didn't look like Michael Jordan, guys

1824
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
It didn't, it was stupid

1825
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:56,000
But yeah

1826
01:21:56,000 --> 01:22:00,000
So with this one, basically you are S.T.A.R.S. member

1827
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:04,000
Jill Valentine or Chris Redfield

1828
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:08,000
And you are exploring this mansion and unlocking its secrets

1829
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
And Chris is helped by Claire

1830
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
Was it Claire? Yeah, it was Claire

1831
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
And she was young and perky and a medic

1832
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:17,000
Rebecca, that was it, Claire was his sister

1833
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
It was Rebecca

1834
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:23,000
And Barry helps Jill

1835
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:26,000
He also has the best line in the game

1836
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
You are almost a Jill sandwich

1837
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:32,000
And I hope this is not Chris's blood

1838
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:33,000
So yeah

1839
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:38,000
It was really, really ahead of its time when it came out

1840
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:43,000
And there's actually other versions out

1841
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:47,000
They did the, I think it was called

1842
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:51,000
I'm trying to find the name of it

1843
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:55,000
They did a redone version of it that was

1844
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:59,000
Like a remix

1845
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
I believe it was like a remix version

1846
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:04,000
And they had different outfits and the items in the house were in different places

1847
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
And the graphics were touched up a little bit

1848
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:09,000
And then there was the GameCube version

1849
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
Which we just heard a little bit of

1850
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:14,000
That was completely redone, better dialogue

1851
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:17,000
I think it still had the same voice cast though

1852
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:21,000
But it's pretty much the original game

1853
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:24,000
Just really, really cleaned up

1854
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
Some of the story elements

1855
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:29,000
They added a little bit more references to the sequel

1856
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:32,000
And Code of Veronica, I think they fixed some of the continuity issues

1857
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:35,000
But otherwise it was the same game

1858
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:39,000
But even in the very first one they had a reference to Ada

1859
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:42,000
Who was in Resident Evil 2

1860
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
And she was really cool

1861
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:47,000
And it also has my favorite thing in here

1862
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
Is the diary

1863
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
Ugly face so ate him

1864
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:54,000
Itchy, tasty

1865
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:57,000
Yeah, so that's where itchy tasty comes from

1866
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:01,000
So this one, I mean it spawned all kinds of sequels

1867
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
You know, we had Code Veronica

1868
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:06,000
We had Resident Evil 2 and 3, 4 and 5

1869
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:10,000
Who remembers Dino Crisis?

1870
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:13,000
Dino Crisis is actually pretty neat

1871
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:20,000
It actually just announced Resident Evil Revelations for the 3DS

1872
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:25,000
And that they had Resident Evil Portable

1873
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
There's all kinds of versions out there

1874
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:28,000
There's mobile games

1875
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
I even had this on the game.com

1876
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:34,000
I'm reminded of a

1877
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:37,000
I'm not sure if it was the advance

1878
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:41,000
But there was a Resident Evil novel guidance side story

1879
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:44,000
Where it's Leon and Barry on a cruise ship, I think

1880
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:45,000
I think you were right

1881
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
I don't think it's canon

1882
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:50,000
Because that's some obscure stuff

1883
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:53,000
There were the Umbrella Chronicles, the Dark Side Chronicles

1884
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
Resident Evil Outbreak

1885
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:58,000
It was a mobile one, you said?

1886
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:59,000
Or handheld?

1887
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:00,000
Handheld

1888
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:05,000
There was Biohazard Eye Survivor

1889
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:08,000
And Resident Evil Assault the Nightmare

1890
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:12,000
You know, actually one of my favorites in the series was Gun Survivor

1891
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
Which I got to play in the arcade

1892
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
No, Gun Con was Namco

1893
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
The accessory

1894
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:21,000
Well, in Japan you could play it with the gun

1895
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
But in the US it

1896
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
Oh yeah, because you can't use those here

1897
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:26,000
They're taboo

1898
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:29,000
Which I always thought it would have been perfect to do it on the Dreamcast

1899
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
Maybe Gun Con in the US

1900
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:34,000
But you couldn't play Gun Survivor, you just navigated through

1901
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:38,000
But I thought that with the D-pad that was on the gun

1902
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
You should have been able to control with that

1903
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:43,000
Although the arcade version was really cool because you

1904
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
Walked by pressing forward with the gun

1905
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:48,000
And you could back up with the gun, it was really fun

1906
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:52,000
But the first Gun Survivor one I think was Code Veronica

1907
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
Or was it the second one?

1908
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
I think that was the second one

1909
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
But that's the one I played

1910
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:02,000
And there was also Resident Evil Operation Raccoon City

1911
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
That was another one

1912
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:10,000
It's supposed to be coming out on Playstation 3, Xbox 360, and on Windows

1913
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:13,000
And Resident Evil 6 is also coming out

1914
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:16,000
So yeah, all kinds of stuff going on

1915
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:20,000
And then there's movies, which the movies don't really have a lot to do with the game

1916
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
Not anymore really

1917
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:25,000
Just a few things that are in common

1918
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:28,000
And there were all kinds of comics that went out

1919
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:32,000
They did a manhua, which the Code Veronica one was actually really good

1920
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:33,000
I liked it

1921
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
All kinds of cool stuff

1922
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
So yeah, Resident Evil

1923
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
Worst voice acting ever in the first one

1924
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
But it's laughable, it's fantastic

1925
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:45,000
And I think Resident Evil of the 3D generation of consoles

1926
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
The Playstation 1 was the first game

1927
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:51,000
That really spawned an entirely new genre

1928
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
Which was survival horror

1929
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
And we have Resident Evil to thank for Silent Hill

1930
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
And that whole franchise

1931
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:01,000
I think Silent Hill took a different turn in survival horror

1932
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
Well yeah, but just the whole dark

1933
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
You against monsters

1934
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
The whole scary thing

1935
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
I think Resident Evil sort of laid down the foundation

1936
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
I don't know, I always thought Friday the 13th

1937
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
On the Nintendo spawn

1938
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
No way, no way

1939
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
It was Nightmare on Elm Street

1940
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:21,000
Or maybe it was the Metal Gear

1941
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
Which I think was always kind of

1942
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
I don't know, it's not necessarily survival horror

1943
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
It's survival tactics

1944
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,000
Survival, tactical, dodging

1945
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
Well that's always stealth

1946
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
Yeah, that'd be stealth action

1947
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
Whatever, shut up

1948
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
But did any of those games have zombie dogs?

1949
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
They did not

1950
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
Okay then, zombie dogs

1951
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,000
So is that it? That's it

1952
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
Classic game of the week, Resident Evil

1953
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
Oh, there's actually one more thing

1954
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
Make it quick

1955
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
That was a beta

1956
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
Of Resident Evil 2

1957
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
That had a different character named

1958
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
Elza Walker and Leon

1959
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
And she was like a motorcycle chick

1960
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
Wearing the red and white leathers

1961
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:05,000
And they actually ended up scrapping it

1962
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
When it was about 60% done

1963
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
I'm trying to get my hands on one of those

1964
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:13,000
I think my N64 box, the console system

1965
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
When the N64 first came out

1966
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
You know how they have

1967
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
On the side of the box

1968
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
The game, like if you buy this console

1969
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
Here are the games that are coming out

1970
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,000
I have one that has a Resident Evil 1.5

1971
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,000
Or 2, because it was supposed to be an N64 game

1972
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
It was supposed to be Resident Evil 2

1973
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
Yeah, that's on that and it never came out

1974
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
I guess for that system

1975
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,000
Because I said the backgrounds weren't interesting enough

1976
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
But it had a lot of the same mechanics

1977
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
From the first one

1978
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,000
But they saved a few things to what eventually became the second one

1979
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,000
And lost a kind of cool looking character

1980
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,000
Sad face

1981
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
That's it

1982
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
Well that's it for your classic game of the week

1983
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
We'll see what she picks next week

1984
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
But for now we're going to take a quick break guys

1985
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
We will be back in just a little bit

1986
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
With more of Orange Lounge Radio

1987
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
Don't go anywhere though guys

1988
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
We've got plenty more coming up in tonight's Part B

1989
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
We're going to talk about the 3DS

1990
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
A little more about the launch

1991
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
A lawsuit against EA

1992
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
And a game called Xenoblade and its localization

1993
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
We're going to come back to the Ultima topic

1994
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
Because there's some really interesting news

1995
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
So that could be very interesting

1996
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
We're going to talk about all that right after this

1997
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000
When we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio

1998
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,000

Also pretty fun

The best little Hoard House in Azeroth

2021
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
It's a little side project

Xtfer and I have all about the world

2023
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000

That's H-O-R-D-E-H-O-U-S-E

2026
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
Up to 20 episodes this week

2027
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,000
We hit 30

2028
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
Nice you're old

2029
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
Oh wait we're on 408 of this show

2030
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
I know right

2031
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
Quickly going to go to

2032
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,000
The rapid fire news

2033
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,000
And the tweets and all that stuff

2034
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
I wanted to ask you

2035
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
Speaking of Twitter and all that

2036
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
Some folks saw that you were doing a little bit of fundraising this week

2037
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
By selling off some of your

2038
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
Video game collection

2039
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
Which I know is probably not an easy thing to do

2040
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000
But what was some of the stuff you sold this week

2041
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
And how did it do?

2042
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
My most coveted title

2043
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
That I got rid of was

2044
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
Magic Knight Rayearth

2045
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
By Working Designs for the Sega Saturn

2046
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
It was the last game put out in the US

2047
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
Months after the Saturn was already

2048
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
Dead and buried

2049
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
They put this out

2050
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
Even more rare I think than Panzer Dragoon Saga

2051
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
I want to say

2052
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
It's up there

2053
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,000
Panzer Dragoon RPG

2054
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
I don't know

2055
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
The two of them are pretty much rivals

2056
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,000
For hardest to find

2057
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,000
So Rayearth was a top down

2058
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
Basically it was a Legend of Zelda

2059
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
A Link to the Past clone

2060
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
As far as visually how it looked

2061
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
The RPG

2062
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,000
Anime cutscenes

2063
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
The clamp anime

2064
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
Beautiful show

2065
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
They did such a good job with translating it

2066
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
Especially since they don't talk every time you touch something

2067
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
Like in a Japanese one

2068
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
It saved so much memory

2069
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,000
It was so much better

2070
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
So that went for

2071
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
I've seen it go for over $100

2072
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
But I got about $80 for it

2073
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
That's not too bad

2074
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000
I never played it

2075
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
Never touched it

2076
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
We've beaten it

2077
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
Bust a Move

2078
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
Not the puzzle bobble thing

2079
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,000
But it was released in the US as Bust a Groove

2080
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
The soundtrack

2081
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
I think in the JP

2082
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
Edition was a lot better

2083
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
Paper Mario 64

2084
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
Ogre Battle 64

2085
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
And a bunch of Saturn import stuff

2086
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
Darkstalkers

2087
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
X-Men vs Street Fighter

2088
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
I'm going to have a round 2 of stuff

2089
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
Going up next week

2090
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
One of which will include

2091
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
The PS2 edition of Rez

2092
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
I'm getting rid of that

2093
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
Because I have it at Rez HD on Xbox 360

2094
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
And I think some DDR games

2095
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
You're going to get rid of too right?

2096
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
Yeah I'm selling my PS1

2097
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
3rd Mix and Best Hits

2098
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
Which I think came out after

2099
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
4th and before 5th

2100
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
Let me talk to you about Rez

2101
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
Ok

2102
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
So check that out, that'll be up soon

2103
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
The reason I'm getting rid of these

2104
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
Is because they're in great shape

2105
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000
I know I'm never going to play them again

2106
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
But actually having them in my hand

2107
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
I wanted to hook my Saturn up

2108
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
To play some Vampire Savior

2109
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
Even though if it wasn't for me selling them

2110
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
I never would have had the Inkling

2111
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
To ever touch the game again

2112
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
Even though it's a great game

2113
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
So it's just weird how you're attached to something

2114
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
But you know you'd never play it

2115
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
Unless you're confronted with getting rid of it

2116
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
It's just weird how nostalgia works

2117
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
That's kind of how our vault is

2118
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
Except we sometimes do get the wild hair

2119
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
To break out one of the systems and play it

2120
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
I mean the whole reason we have

2121
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
So many systems is because nothing quite

2122
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
Mimics having the controller

2123
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
In your hand

2124
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
You can play Vampire Savior with us

2125
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
I'll hook up the Saturn

2126
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
Alright, well let's get to some rapid

2127
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
Fire news before we get into

2128
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
Doing the tweets tonight

2129
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,000
Last call for tweets at twitter.com slash o-l-r

2130
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,000
Meanwhile Loki hates to tear you

2131
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
Away from whatever it is you're doing over there

2132
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
That involves a lot of numbers

2133
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
I don't think that's porn

2134
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,000
But yeah we gotta do some rapid news

2135
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
I'm crunching in numbers

2136
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
Yeah there's some cool announcements

2137
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
Chopped Lifter HD

2138
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
It's a remake of the classic game

2139
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
Supposed to be coming out on the Playstation

2140
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
Network and PC this fall

2141
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
And based on some of the screenshots

2142
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
Here

2143
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
Looks

2144
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
A little

2145
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
Much like the classic game just you know

2146
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
With the 3D HD visuals

2147
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
Kinda cool looking

2148
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
I don't know, hopefully it turns out well

2149
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
And then

2150
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
Another remake also in the works

2151
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
Warlords

2152
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
The old Atari game is being remade

2153
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
That one's coming to Xbox Live Arcade

2154
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
And Playstation Network this summer

2155
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
You probably can expect that as part of the

2156
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
Summer of gaming or whatever the hell they call it

2157
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
On the Xbox Live

2158
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
They're saying that it's gonna also

2159
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
I guess have the classic version

2160
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
As well as an

2161
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,000
Evolved version

2162
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,000
I guess which was found

2163
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
Or they had the evolved version

2164
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
Which was in a previous Xbox Live Arcade release

2165
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
But this

2166
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
I guess is gonna be

2167
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,000
Something different

2168
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
Never really played

2169
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
The original Warlords game so

2170
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
I don't know, looks neat

2171
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,000
And then finally

2172
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
Minecraft

2173
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
Goes into beta 1.4

2174
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
And they added

2175
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
The wolves, cookies

2176
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
And some other stuff

2177
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
Yeah tameable wolves

2178
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
Cookies, sleeping in a bed

2179
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
Resets your spawn position

2180
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
A new logo holding shift while

2181
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
Climbing will hang onto the ladder

2182
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
Spiders no longer

2183
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,000
Trample crops and

2184
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
Lots and lots of infrastructure

2185
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
And statistical

2186
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
achievements

2187
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
Alright

2188
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
Neat, let's

2189
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000
Have you played Minecraft yet?

2190
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
No I have not either

2191
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
I watched a funny video today though

2192
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
Of some girl's Minecraft house

2193
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,000
And she was just really funny

2194
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,000
Oh my god there's like 400 pounds of bacon right here

2195
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,000
And there were like pigs everywhere in front of her house

2196
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,000
It was really funny

2197
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
I haven't played Minecraft

2198
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
But yet I've played SingStar

2199
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000
And SingStar is adding 40 new songs to the store

2200
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
This week

2201
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
Now you can sing along with such karaoke classics

2202
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
As Cryin' by Aerosmith

2203
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
Who Let the Dogs Out by The Baja Men

2204
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,000
Crocodile Rock by Elton John

2205
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,000
Let's see

2206
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,000
I'm Good I'm Gone by Leaky Lee

2207
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,000
Likey Lee?

2208
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
I don't even know how to say her name

2209
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
She's crazier than Bjork

2210
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,000
I don't know how you would sing along to that

2211
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,000
But you can now

2212
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
Grace Kelly by Mika

2213
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
A bunch of songs by the band Razorlight

2214
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
Oh, Just for Salacious Pop

2215
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,000
I know you love the Pussycat Dolls

2216
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,000
So you can do Hush Hush now

2217
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,000
On SingStar

2218
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
Also some dance add-ons have been sold as well

2219
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,000
And then most interesting in a way

2220
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,000
Classical song packs

2221
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
I'm not sure how exactly you sing

2222
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,000
I guess maybe it's old opera style

2223
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,000
I don't know but you can do

2224
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
O Sole Mio by Di Capua

2225
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,000
Mozart with Queen of the Night Aria

2226
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
La Donna y Mobile

2227
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
by Verdi

2228
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,000
I don't know why but yeah

2229
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,000
now classic songs are available

2230
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,000
I know classical singers

2231
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,000
That's a series that's like Boohoo Crazy in Europe

2232
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
Yeah, it's pretty big over there

2233
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,000
There are okay games here

2234
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,000
They had the SingStar Queen

2235
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,000
and the SingStar Abba

2236
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
Probably the biggest thing about this is that

2237
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
the actual music videos, if available, play

2238
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
behind the song when you're singing it

2239
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
So that's pretty cool

2240
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
Can't wait to see the music video for the Mozart stuff

2241
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
I know, I'm kind of wondering how that's gonna work

2242
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
I have some generic video in the background there

2243
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
I don't know

2244
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,000
Well, some more information following unfortunately

2245
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,000
the tragedy in Japan

2246
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,000
It has some folks asking a little bit forward

2247
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,000
What's gonna happen to Tokyo Game Show 2011?

2248
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,000
Well, now there's no plans to

2249
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,000
cancel the Tokyo Game Show just yet

2250
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000
But they are saying it could happen in a reduced state

2251
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,000
This was in an interview

2252
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,000
that the Tokyo Game Show officials did with Kotaku

2253
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:01,000
They didn't say anything yet

2254
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,000
But they did say

2255
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,000
Depending on the situation from here on out

2256
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,000
It's possible that the show

2257
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,000
is reduced

2258
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,000
The show is scheduled to take place in September

2259
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,000
I'm sure it'll still be a

2260
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
pretty big thing and they haven't said

2261
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,000
it's closed off to the public or any of that yet

2262
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,000
But they are treading a little bit

2263
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
carefully with a lot of uncertainty

2264
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000
still happening in the world

2265
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,000
after the really unfortunate

2266
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,000
earthquake and subsequent

2267
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,000
tsunami and subsequent issues with the reactor

2268
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
and all that stuff

2269
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,000
Hopefully they're able to get all that sorted out

2270
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,000
in the 2021 show in September

2271
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,000
Speaking of the tragedy in Japan

2272
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,000
A real favorite here of

2273
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,000
Orange Lounge Radio is spearing up a new

2274
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,000
effort to raise money

2275
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,000
Akira Yamaoka, who of course was

2276
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,000
one of the minds behind Silent Hill

2277
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,000
and so forth, he is doing a benefit

2278
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,000
album for tsunami survivors

2279
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,000
It's called Play for Japan

2280
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:55,000
Kind of a play on words of the

2281
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,000
Pray for Japan Twitter hashtag that was going on at the time

2282
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,000
It's gonna be a benefit album

2283
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,000
and it's gonna have some of these

2284
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:03,000
participants will be involved

2285
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:05,000
Akira Yamaoka, Nobuo Uematsu

2286
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,000
who did of course Final Fantasy and a lot of those

2287
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
Yasunori Mitsuda, Chrono Trigger

2288
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,000
hello, need I say more

2289
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,000
Bear McCreery, if you don't recognize that

2290
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,000
Battlestar Galactica

2291
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,000
and which, god that had a great

2292
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,000
soundtrack that show

2293
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:21,000
and Woody Jackson who did Red Dead Redemption

2294
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,000
so some western influence

2295
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:25,000
as well as from Japan

2296
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,000
so that's pretty awesome

2297
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,000
Akira Yamaoka also posted a letter at

2298
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,000
playforjapan.org

2299
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,000
available in several languages

2300
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,000
so that's pretty cool, it's supposed to come out in May 2011

2301
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,000
on iTunes

2302
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,000
so you don't even have to leave the house to do your

2303
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,000
little bit to help support

2304
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:43,000
the Japanese relief, I think that's a great idea

2305
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:45,000
Alright, let's move on

2306
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,000
Dr. Sakura

2307
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:49,000
Well, we have some

2308
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:51,000
Street Fighter news actually coming out of

2309
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,000
the UK

2310
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,000
there was

2311
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,000
registered for the BBFC

2312
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000
Super Street Fighter 4 Arcade Edition

2313
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,000
to be coming out in June

2314
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:03,000
that's the British Board of Film Classification

2315
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,000
which also is in charge of

2316
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,000
video games for some reason

2317
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,000
why can't they do that here?

2318
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,000
anyway

2319
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
Capcom hasn't

2320
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,000
necessarily confirmed

2321
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,000
but they're putting out that there's

2322
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,000
that it could be

2323
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:21,000
download content

2324
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,000
or you can buy an expansion, they're still

2325
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,000
speculating

2326
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,000
also in other news

2327
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,000
Music Unlimited, the platform is coming

2328
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,000
to PSP, NGP

2329
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,000
and Xperia Play

2330
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,000
this was actually stated

2331
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:37,000
by the CEO of Sony Network

2332
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,000
Entertainment, Sean Layden

2333
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,000
saying that it's going to be coming

2334
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,000
to the PSP in a matter of weeks

2335
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,000
so that will be later on this year

2336
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,000
and

2337
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,000
this is

2338
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:51,000
as far as I can tell

2339
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,000
I think this is a music sharing

2340
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:55,000
program

2341
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
from what it looks like

2342
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,000
but like a legal way of doing it

2343
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,000
instead of like you know

2344
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:03,000
LimeWire or whatever the kids use these days

2345
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
BitTorrent I guess

2346
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:07,000
and then in Rock Band 3

2347
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,000
news we have Joy Division download content

2348
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,000
which I like Joy Division

2349
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,000
but not just them, we have Grand Funk Railroad

2350
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,000
the Locomotion and we're an American band

2351
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,000
and J Gal's band Freeze Frame

2352
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:19,000
and Joy Division Love Will Tear Us Apart

2353
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,000
That's it

2354
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,000
Alright, let's go to the Twitter

2355
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
but first I want to read a comment here from our chatroom

2356
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,000
at chat.orangelandtrady.com

2357
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,000
Kossin in our chatroom says

2358
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,000
I do not want the MPAA

2359
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,000
in charge of video game ratings

2360
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,000
those guys are idiots

2361
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,000
yeah actually that's a really good point, those guys are idiots

2362
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,000
you know the way they rate some of those movies

2363
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,000
is unbelievable

2364
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,000
I like the idea of a unified system

2365
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,000
between movies and

2366
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,000
video games but don't fucking put the MPAA

2367
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,000
in charge of that, dismantle the MPAA

2368
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
and put a new board in charge

2369
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,000
that would be a wonderful idea

2370
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:55,000
so a good point from that person in our chatroom

2371
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,000
Let's go to the Twitter

2372
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
twitter.com

2373
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,000
slash o-l-r is where you can send us

2374
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
tweets every week

2375
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:05,000
we read your tweets here on the show and we'll respond to them

2376
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,000
Fun ET Man sent us a tweet

2377
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
saying I wonder if you will talk about this

2378
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
and sent us to an article on

2379
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,000
thelostlevels.org

2380
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:15,000
this is a website that likes to kind of find

2381
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,000
old prototypes and things that have

2382
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,000
changed in games, they've done some

2383
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,000
stories on Zelda or whatever

2384
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,000
well this article happens to be on the game

2385
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,000
Bio Force Ape

2386
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,000
and I guess this is a game that was kind of recently

2387
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,000
finally dumped into a ROM

2388
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,000
here's the deal, this game never actually

2389
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,000
came out, it was teased in

2390
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,000
Nintendo Power in the early 90's

2391
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:37,000
it was an NES game and in this game

2392
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,000
you take control of Bio Force Ape

2393
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,000
a genetically altered super chimpanzee

2394
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:43,000
as he tries to make his way through a high-tech

2395
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:45,000
maze to rescue his adopted human family

2396
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,000
what? yeah right?

2397
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,000
apparently one of the best parts of the game

2398
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,000
is when Bio Force Ape takes a wild out of

2399
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,000
control ride on one of the speeding platforms

2400
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
or coal cars

2401
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,000
animation is humorous and so on and so on

2402
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
and yeah so I guess there was

2403
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
this whole debacle, somebody had

2404
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,000
the game, it came out in

2405
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,000
2005 that the game was out

2406
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,000
there and that there was photographic evidence

2407
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:09,000
taken and I guess

2408
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,000
you know obviously the thing was

2409
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
it had bugs in it and so forth

2410
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,000
the guy was urged to

2411
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,000
sell the prototype but he was

2412
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,000
really scared about the ROM getting out there

2413
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
more

2414
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,000
stuff came out including this

2415
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,000
humorous punching of a slime

2416
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,000
it's like a monkey made out of

2417
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,000
butter, what is that? I don't even know what that is

2418
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,000
but then apparently he smashed the

2419
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,000
cartridge, he said screw you guys

2420
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,000
I'm going home and smashed the cartridge

2421
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,000
well apparently the real deal was finally

2422
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,000
sold and

2423
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,000
dumped and there's actually a whole little

2424
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:43,000
thing available on YouTube

2425
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,000
where you can actually kind of see some of this game in progress

2426
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,000
it's fast moving for an NES game at the

2427
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,000
time, it looks like it has blast processing

2428
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,000
it looks like it is made by Sega

2429
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,000
no it's not Sega, it's close

2430
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,000
it's uh, SETA

2431
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:01,000
SETA made the game

2432
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,000
it looks like a Ninja Gaiden ROM hack

2433
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
or something, a little bit doesn't it

2434
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
it's very fast moving

2435
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
see there's a little minecart

2436
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,000
it looks kind of cool

2437
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,000
go monkey go, go monkey go

2438
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,000
alright

2439
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,000
let's see moving on to some more

2440
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,000
tweets here

2441
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,000
SSA100Matt sent us a tweet saying

2442
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:23,000
our old pal YYR has released

2443
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:25,000
a press kit for Snake

2444
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,000
361, it's the sequel

2445
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,000
to Snake 360

2446
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,000
Snake 361 is supposed to be coming out for

2447
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,000
the holidays this year

2448
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:35,000
and let's see what is some new stuff

2449
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,000
teleporters and traps

2450
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,000
so now you get teleporters in the game

2451
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,000
of course Snake 360 had the

2452
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,000
four player battles, it was very

2453
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,000
multiplayer, they really should let this

2454
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,000
they really should just let him put it out on Xbox Live

2455
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,000
it would be really cool if you could actually play it

2456
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:51,000
through the interwebs, but right now

2457
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,000
it's more of a local multiplayer game

2458
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,000
and I think he had YouTubes of people playing the game

2459
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,000
and having fun, battle mode

2460
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,000
will, I mean those teleporters are going to drive you

2461
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,000
bonkers in battle mode, so that'll be fun

2462
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,000
and there's some 1080p screenshots

2463
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,000
available now and some music

2464
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,000
is all there, so all the information is

2465
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,000
available at snake360.com

2466
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,000
Spazinator

2467
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,000
tweets us a story, it's a Sony

2468
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:15,000
story here, let me see what this is all about

2469
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:17,000
I've got to load this, it's not loading

2470
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:19,000
God dammit he's trying to rickroll us

2471
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:21,000
you little bastard, I cut it off

2472
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,000
before he could, was that real?

2473
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,000
yeah it started coming, it said Rick Astley

2474
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,000
nope, nope, done with that

2475
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,000
so congratulations Spazinator

2476
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,000
you have banned yourself from

2477
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,000
Twitter for one whole month, we will not be reading

2478
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,000
your tweets for one whole month

2479
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,000
that's what's going to happen to people that try to

2480
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,000
rickroll us, you are banned from Twitter for a month

2481
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,000
congratulations, alright

2482
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
let's move on to Tiger Claw

2483
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,000
sends us a couple links here, one of them

2484
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
is about Burnout Crash

2485
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,000
Burnout Crash is coming to the

2486
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,000
Xbox 360 and the Playstation 3

2487
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,000
I guess EA hasn't

2488
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,000
announced a new Burnout game

2489
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,000
but Australia actually released

2490
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,000
a classification for

2491
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:03,000
Burnout Crash

2492
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:05,000
and I guess surfing some LinkedIn profiles

2493
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,000
has found out that this is happening

2494
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:09,000
it's an Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 title

2495
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,000
no official announcement yet

2496
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,000
seems logical there would be another Burnout game

2497
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,000
at some point, hopefully it's a little more like

2498
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,000
the older games, I know the Burnout Paradise

2499
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,000
or whatever was really well supported

2500
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,000
but that franchise

2501
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,000
still sells really well, right?

2502
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,000
as far as I know, yeah

2503
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,000
Paradise was awesome

2504
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,000
alright, I mean

2505
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,000
come on, you gotta love, it's like

2506
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,000
oh, any moment I want to go in the crash mode, ok

2507
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000
crash mode, it was awesome

2508
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
alright, and

2509
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,000
moving on, let's see, Tiger Claw

2510
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,000
sends us one more link here, I'll read

2511
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,000
the other one he sent us

2512
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,000
is coming up later, let's see

2513
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:47,000
Americans average 13 minutes

2514
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,000
playing video games on TV

2515
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,000
daily

2516
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,000
only 13 minutes?

2517
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
I think that's the people who play for 4 hours at a time

2518
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,000
balancing out those that don't play at all

2519
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,000
I don't know how that works, but yeah

2520
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,000
adults spend an average of 13 minutes

2521
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000
a day using a TV to play video games

2522
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,000
that's from Nielsen's state of the media

2523
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,000
US TV trends

2524
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,000
by ethnicity

2525
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,000
I guess, because now it breaks it all down

2526
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,000
by ethnic as well

2527
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,000
African Americans spend slightly more time

2528
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:17,000
playing video games on TV averaging

2529
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,000
16 minutes a day across the population

2530
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,000
Hispanics spend an average of 10 minutes a day

2531
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,000
you know, they're all

2532
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,000
less than 20 minutes

2533
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:27,000
which most people I know that play video games spend

2534
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,000
hours and hours, so

2535
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:31,000
this is just this weird law of averages thing

2536
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,000
coming into play

2537
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,000
Nielsen got paid probably millions of dollars to do that study

2538
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,000
that really didn't tell me anything

2539
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,000
ironically enough though, you have to admit this is a little bit ironic

2540
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,000
according to their little graph here

2541
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
the smallest ethnicity

2542
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,000
or I should say the smallest playtime

2543
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,000
by any ethnicity, 9 minutes

2544
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:49,000
Asians, who knew?

2545
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:51,000
there you go

2546
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,000
because they have

2547
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,000
the tiger mom

2548
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:57,000
I guess, I don't know

2549
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,000
let's move on

2550
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,000
something a little less racial please

2551
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:03,000
a little less racial?

2552
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,000
alright, fine

2553
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
so we're gonna talk a little bit about

2554
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
the 3DS, obviously

2555
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,000
3DS probably did pretty well

2556
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
I'd assume

2557
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,000
Nintendo's saying it's the best first day

2558
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,000
handheld sales

2559
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:19,000
launch ever

2560
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:21,000
so

2561
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:23,000
there's no real numbers yet

2562
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:25,000
but they're saying they did pretty well

2563
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,000
and I guess the numbers will be made public on April 14th

2564
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,000
when the NPD numbers actually

2565
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,000
come out

2566
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
so it'll be interesting to see how well they did

2567
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,000
I'm assuming they sold everything

2568
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,000
or at least pretty close to everything within the last

2569
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:39,000
probably week it came out

2570
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,000
so

2571
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
good for them, I suppose

2572
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,000
unfortunately though

2573
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,000
it wasn't without problems

2574
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:49,000
there are some issues with the 3DS

2575
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,000
including some crashes

2576
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,000
apparently people have been running into

2577
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,000
some software crashes

2578
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,000
that require the system

2579
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,000
to be shut off and then turned back on

2580
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:01,000
to get it playing right

2581
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,000
apparently this was fixed in

2582
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,000
the latest firmware

2583
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
the one you download to get your little 3D video

2584
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,000
from OKGO

2585
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:11,000
so that's kind of cool

2586
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
at least that's been fixed

2587
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,000
however something that's not really gonna be able to be fixed

2588
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,000
some sort of patching system

2589
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,000
is the fact that the hinges once again

2590
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,000
are loose or at least some people are

2591
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,000
reporting loose hinges which require

2592
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:25,000
you to actually send your system back in to get it repaired

2593
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:27,000
what a slut that 3DS

2594
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,000
must be, totally loose I heard

2595
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,000
I haven't had that problem with the loose hinge

2596
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,000
yet, but I know it was something that

2597
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
plagued a lot of systems before

2598
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,000
especially on the DS Lite

2599
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:39,000
kind of sucks

2600
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,000
but thankfully

2601
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:43,000
not a problem for me

2602
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,000
well hopefully they'll fix a lot of these

2603
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:47,000
hardware problems in the 3DS Lite

2604
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:49,000
which will come out next year inevitably

2605
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,000
or the 3DS XL

2606
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,000
or the 3DS I

2607
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,000
or the 3DS bigger peen

2608
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,000
whatever they're gonna call it that comes out next year

2609
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,000
yeah, so

2610
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,000
you can bet on that, and then colors of course

2611
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,000
there'll be colors

2612
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,000
alright, moving on

2613
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:07,000
lawsuit!

2614
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,000
somebody is suing EA

2615
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
there might be some weight to this one though

2616
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:13,000
if you're in law suits or somebody mad about something a little frivolous

2617
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:15,000
this could have some actual weight to it

2618
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,000
you know the game John Madden

2619
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:19,000
Football? Well you ought to because

2620
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,000
this is the series that became Madden

2621
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:23,000
NFL like what, oh

2622
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:25,000
7, oh 8, oh 9, 11, 10

2623
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:27,000
an annual sequel for like 20 years or something

2624
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:29,000
yeah, every year there's a damn Madden game

2625
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:31,000
well it started as a game called John Madden Football

2626
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,000
and it was originally what?

2627
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:35,000
it was on the Commodore 64

2628
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,000
the Apple II, it was on DOS systems

2629
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,000
all the way back in 1988

2630
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,000
it was the first John Madden Football

2631
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,000
and you can kind of tell because like in this little like

2632
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,000
horrible pixelated screenshot

2633
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,000
that was the extent of the Commodore 64 graphics

2634
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,000
back in the day, like look how pixelated he is

2635
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:51,000
and also his hair is not totally

2636
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:53,000
grey, I mean clearly that's toupee

2637
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,000
but it's not like totally freaking grey

2638
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,000
so you know this is a long

2639
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,000
old game, well my point with

2640
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:01,000
this here is that Robin

2641
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:03,000
Antonick who created the very

2642
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:05,000
first game, and you see his name there in the programming

2643
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:07,000
there, in Madden

2644
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,000
apparently

2645
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,000
23 years after this very first game

2646
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:13,000
he is not seeing

2647
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,000
any revenue from it

2648
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,000
now he has filed suit against

2649
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:19,000
Electronic Arts for tens of millions in royalties

2650
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:21,000
and apparently

2651
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,000
he was responsible for the development of

2652
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:25,000
virtually all the groundbreaking technology

2653
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:27,000
at the heart of the game, that's at least

2654
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:29,000
what he claims in his suit

2655
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:31,000
EA has not paid this guy

2656
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:33,000
any royalties since

2657
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:35,000
1992

2658
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:37,000
was the last time he got royalties

2659
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,000
interesting, I mean

2660
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:41,000
he did make the original game, it was

2661
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,000
kinda his baby, I mean I'm

2662
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:45,000
sure the game has changed many times since

2663
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,000
then, something you may not know, John

2664
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,000
Madden football did not have actual NFL

2665
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,000
teams, they didn't have the NFL license at the time

2666
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,000
EA got that years later

2667
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:55,000
so you know you could say

2668
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,000
the game's changed a whole fuck ton since

2669
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,000
the beginning, so maybe this guy doesn't deserve

2670
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:01,000
anything, well yeah I mean it's

2671
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,000
John Madden's namesake

2672
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:05,000
that's the brand, you know

2673
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:07,000
the actual announcer guy

2674
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:09,000
but this person

2675
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:11,000
Robin

2676
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,000
sounds like he might have signed a bad contract

2677
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:15,000
when they took the license from

2678
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:17,000
him where he was paid up front for the

2679
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:19,000
concept

2680
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,000
of what it is, but I'd have to read more

2681
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,000
about what the actual

2682
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:25,000
the complaint that was filed in court

2683
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:27,000
I would need to read that to know

2684
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,000
how reasonable this is

2685
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:31,000
yeah, but

2686
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:33,000
it's gonna be interesting, I mean especially

2687
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,000
with such a huge franchise to see

2688
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:37,000
kinda what happens with this, but you know

2689
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:39,000
a lot of times, especially back in the day

2690
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:41,000
I mean back in the 80's, you know this was

2691
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:43,000
always a huge thing where programmers

2692
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:45,000
really weren't getting the credit they deserved

2693
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,000
I mean that was why Activision was kinda

2694
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,000
formed in the first place, it was a bunch of

2695
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:51,000
people really upset that programmers didn't

2696
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,000
get more credit in Atari games

2697
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,000
the very first Easter egg

2698
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:57,000
in a video game was where

2699
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:59,000
the dude's initials were in Adventure

2700
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,000
that was so that the guy could kinda sneak

2701
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,000
his credit in there, because Atari never

2702
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,000
credited their programmers and game designers

2703
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,000
but Activision, remember the names like

2704
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:09,000
David Crane and so forth, these guys would make the games

2705
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,000
and get to put their names on them, because a lot of

2706
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:13,000
these Atari games were by like one guy

2707
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:15,000
or two guys

2708
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:17,000
and they're cool guys

2709
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:19,000
ET, worst Atari 2600

2710
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,000
game of all time, according to some people

2711
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:23,000
was done by a guy called Howard Scott Warshaw

2712
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:25,000
you know why else he's famous?

2713
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:27,000
He also made Yara's Revenge, made one of the best games

2714
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,000
he's one of the worst games, go figure

2715
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:31,000
you should read about how he was

2716
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:33,000
under all that pressure to make ET, it really makes

2717
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:35,000
a lot of sense as to why that game didn't come out so well

2718
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:37,000
Pac-Man was

2719
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,000
one guy too that wanted

2720
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:41,000
to put it on a bigger cartridge, but Atari wouldn't let him

2721
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:43,000
because it would cost too much, that's why it sucked

2722
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:45,000
so

2723
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:47,000
that's so bad, it's like the worst port ever

2724
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,000
but it's so funny because you play the old school

2725
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,000
Pac-Man on the 2600 and it really

2726
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,000
is garbage, but then they had a Miss Pac-Man

2727
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,000
later, it was great

2728
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:57,000
for an Atari game, it was great

2729
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:59,000
well the reason why is because the

2730
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:01,000
Miss Pac-Man was on like a 4K cart

2731
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,000
whereas the Pac-Man was on like half that

2732
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:05,000
maybe a quarter of that, I don't know

2733
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:07,000
so like, the whole drawing one

2734
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:09,000
ghost every frame, why the ghost

2735
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:11,000
flickered so terribly, that was a restriction

2736
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:13,000
of the cartridge, I mean think about it

2737
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:15,000
those programmers had 2K

2738
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:17,000
to design an entire

2739
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,000
game, 2K

2740
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:21,000
is how long an SA is, you know, it's

2741
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:23,000
crazy

2742
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:25,000
anyhow

2743
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:27,000
boy, we

2744
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:29,000
should get into classic gaming discussion a lot on this

2745
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,000
show, it's pretty good, alright, it's cause we love it

2746
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,000
we do, uh, and we're old

2747
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,000
um, Dark

2748
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:37,000
Sakura, Wii, what do you mean

2749
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:39,000
Wii, I'm sorry, especially Dark

2750
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,000
Sakura, hey, don't make me break

2751
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:43,000
out the vuvuzela

2752
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:45,000
how about I break out another new story

2753
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,000
well, Monolith

2754
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,000
Soft's putting out the Wii

2755
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:51,000
RPG Xenoblade, and it's being

2756
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:53,000
localized, for

2757
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:55,000
Europe, yay

2758
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:57,000
um,

2759
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:59,000
it's actually going up for

2760
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:01,000
Xenoblade Chronicles, that

2761
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:03,000
um, although the trailer itself is

2762
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:05,000
untranslated

2763
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:07,000
it shows basically all of the imagery

2764
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:09,000
going out, um, Nintendo

2765
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,000
of Europe put out a press release

2766
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,000
and then removed it

2767
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:15,000
um, but somebody

2768
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,000
actually managed to get it out and get the information

2769
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,000
out, and it's supposed to, uh, have

2770
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:21,000
English and Japanese voice action

2771
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:23,000
uh, voice, uh, options

2772
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:25,000
so

2773
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:27,000
maybe we'll get it

2774
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:29,000
here too? I'm assuming if they're gonna

2775
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,000
spend the time to translate into English that they're

2776
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:33,000
gonna release it in not

2777
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:35,000
more than one region, I mean, they gotta

2778
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:37,000
what if there's like an elevator in the game

2779
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:39,000
and they call it a lift? Americans

2780
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:41,000
might not understand, oh my god, where will they

2781
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,000
find that one employee to type

2782
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:45,000
elevator?

2783
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:47,000
Woo, that was a day's work, there

2784
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:49,000
what if somebody in the

2785
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:51,000
game, maybe there's a smoking scene and the guy

2786
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:53,000
says he's gonna go out and have a fag

2787
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:55,000
and that could never go over here in the

2788
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:57,000
US, because like, you know, Glatt will sue

2789
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,000
once again, you know, that same employee

2790
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:01,000
on day two could easily type

2791
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:03,000
cigarette

2792
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:05,000
this looks pretty good though, or maybe they're gonna

2793
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:07,000
go out and have a crumpet and people will be like

2794
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:09,000
they don't know what the fuck that is over in the United

2795
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,000
States, pants versus trousers, people

2796
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:13,000
will just burst into tears, exactly

2797
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:15,000
my favorite one is the word fanny

2798
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,000
it's not just a pack anymore

2799
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:19,000
no, fanny

2800
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:21,000
here is your butt, there, the vag

2801
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:23,000
oh my, is that why

2802
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,000
a fanny pack is really in the front?

2803
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:27,000
a friend of mine explained that

2804
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:29,000
to me, of course, well, you know why I always

2805
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:31,000
giggle when I pass the catering place, because

2806
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:33,000
it's called Randy Peters?

2807
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:35,000
because Randy is like horny

2808
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:37,000
oh, I get it, oh

2809
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:39,000
you're a nerd, alright

2810
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:41,000
I wanna get to

2811
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:43,000
some old comments from our chat room, it was on

2812
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:45,000
the last story, but my bad, we

2813
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:47,000
didn't get around to this here

2814
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:49,000
let's see, GameGuru

2815
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:51,000
in response to the whole Madden lawsuit

2816
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:53,000
thing said, all EA has to do is prove

2817
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:55,000
that his code was not used after 1992

2818
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:57,000
or that the contract

2819
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:59,000
with them was only valid until 1992

2820
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:01,000
Spazernator

2821
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:03,000
says, yet Activision no longer gives

2822
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:05,000
credits and manuals anymore, oh the irony

2823
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:07,000
and DarkToaGak follows that up

2824
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:09,000
with what the fuck is a game manual

2825
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:11,000
I thought they did have

2826
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:13,000
credits and game manuals, they're just like all the way in the back

2827
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:15,000
they do, and then EA

2828
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:17,000
EA doesn't have manuals anymore

2829
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:19,000
from what I remember, really, they're all

2830
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:21,000
digital, it's all online now, digital manuals

2831
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,000
it's all on the disc, I think you just have to make

2832
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:25,000
the information available

2833
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:27,000
this game looks super pretty by the way

2834
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:29,000
oh, the Xenoblade, yeah, yeah it looks

2835
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:31,000
pretty cool, it doesn't look like a Wii game

2836
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:33,000
that's for sure, alright

2837
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:35,000
just a couple more stories before we get to the mailbag

2838
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:37,000
mailbag.orangelaungeradio.com is where

2839
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:39,000
we invite you guys to email us every week

2840
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:41,000
we talked a little bit about how there was a

2841
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:43,000
PlayStation 1 emulator for Android

2842
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:45,000
and how, you know, that may

2843
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:47,000
interfere with the PlayStation phone

2844
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:49,000
since, you know, anybody could just download ROMs

2845
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:51,000
and play them on there

2846
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:53,000
yeah, except that, you know, Sony decided

2847
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:55,000
hey, you know what, we got this PlayStation

2848
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:57,000
phone coming out, so

2849
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:59,000
ahhhh, let's get it removed

2850
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:01,000
so PSX4Droid

2851
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:03,000
was removed from the Android marketplace

2852
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:05,000
without warning due to

2853
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,000
a content policy violation

2854
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:09,000
um, he's

2855
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:11,000
I guess, are, you know, saying

2856
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:13,000
what the hell, he's expecting, he

2857
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:15,000
figured it was from the, you know,

2858
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:17,000
Xperia Play coming out, but also

2859
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:19,000
that it's a little weird seeing as

2860
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:21,000
there's other, um

2861
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:23,000
another emulator already

2862
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:25,000
on there, FPSC

2863
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:27,000
that's still on the marketplace

2864
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:29,000
so he's like, what the hell

2865
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:31,000
um, and he couldn't be more right

2866
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:33,000
that that was pretty much the reason

2867
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:35,000
why they removed it, because the day after

2868
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:37,000
it was removed, PlayStation 1

2869
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:39,000
games started appearing on the Android marketplace

2870
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:41,000
and of course, they were limited to the

2871
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:43,000
Xperia Play

2872
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:45,000
and the initial offerings, of course, were

2873
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:47,000
Cool Borders 2, Destruction

2874
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:49,000
Derby, Jumping Flash

2875
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:51,000
Medieval 2, and Siphon Filter

2876
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:53,000
and, uh,

2877
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:55,000
all those are available for

2878
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:57,000
$6 or $3.99

2879
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:59,000
and, uh, I guess it's the same

2880
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:01,000
price that they're going on the

2881
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:03,000
PlayStation ork right now

2882
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:05,000
um,

2883
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:07,000
it is kind of, uh, funny that I

2884
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:09,000
guess they're saying that, um

2885
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:11,000
I don't

2886
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:13,000
know, I would think

2887
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:17,000
I thought the marketplace for Android was

2888
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:19,000
open, I mean, if you can't get your app

2889
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:21,000
on the Android marketplace, I mean, there's other

2890
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:23,000
marketplaces out there where you can

2891
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:25,000
I don't know

2892
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:27,000
upload it somewhere else and someone can download it from

2893
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:29,000
that website, am I correct, I think?

2894
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:31,000
Because I know they have the Amazon marketplace

2895
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:33,000
now, and obviously that's not on the Android

2896
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:35,000
marketplace

2897
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:37,000
I don't know, iPhone's

2898
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:39,000
all different. They're all, oh yeah, everyone in here

2899
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:41,000
is an iPhone already. Yeah, I know, so sorry

2900
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:43,000
don't mean to be ignorant, but it's how it is

2901
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:45,000
Well, I mean, that sucks

2902
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:47,000
I guess, but, you know, it makes sense because

2903
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:49,000
obviously, you know, if there's a free PlayStation

2904
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:51,000
or even a PlayStation emulator

2905
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:53,000
that you can buy and then download the ROMs

2906
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:55,000
for, that would kind of defeat

2907
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:57,000
the point of having to buy

2908
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:59,000
you know, all

2909
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:01,000
these different games

2910
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:03,000
and, you know, if it is anything

2911
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:05,000
like a normal Android phone

2912
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:07,000
people really want to, since it is

2913
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:09,000
legal to jailbreak your phone

2914
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:11,000
you could jailbreak or root your phone

2915
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:13,000
and download this anyways

2916
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:15,000
and... But really, why play a PlayStation

2917
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:17,000
game on your phone?

2918
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:19,000
Well, why buy a phone that's meant

2919
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:21,000
for playing PlayStation games

2920
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:23,000
if you're not going to play PlayStation games

2921
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:25,000
better yet, why buy a phone

2922
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:27,000
to play PlayStation games? I'm not sure

2923
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:29,000
I don't know, I guess it's really not that different

2924
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:31,000
than the PSP when all is said and done, but I don't know

2925
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:33,000
I know, but... I guess that

2926
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:35,000
when I think playing games on my phone

2927
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:37,000
I think that the horrible

2928
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:39,000
horrible touchscreen

2929
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:41,000
controls on the iPod

2930
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:43,000
iPhone, that only very few

2931
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:45,000
games get right, like, I hate

2932
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:47,000
the whole, like, static button

2933
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:49,000
like, trying to put a layer of button thing

2934
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:51,000
on the screen, expect that to work, because it doesn't

2935
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:53,000
like, games like Mega Man 2 and stuff are just fucking

2936
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:55,000
terrible, you know, and I think of like

2937
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:57,000
how the fuck are you supposed to play a PlayStation game

2938
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:59,000
with that type of setup, but then I forget

2939
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:01,000
oh yeah, these Xperia plays and stuff, they actually have buttons

2940
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:03,000
they're meant, they're like PSPs

2941
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:05,000
but they actually work as phones, so that makes a lot more

2942
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:07,000
sense to me. But

2943
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:09,000
I don't know, I mean, it's not like this thing

2944
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:11,000
plays PSP games

2945
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:13,000
it plays PlayStation 1 games, I mean

2946
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:15,000
really, who's really... Your PSP

2947
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:17,000
will play PlayStation 1 games too. Exactly, I mean

2948
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:19,000
if you really want something to play

2949
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:21,000
PlayStation 1 games on, seriously

2950
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:23,000
go find a generation 1

2951
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:25,000
PSP, oh my god

2952
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:27,000
that would probably be pretty dirt cheap

2953
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:29,000
or go to a

2954
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:31,000
farmer's market

2955
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:33,000
auction thing that has the, you know

2956
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:35,000
I'm thinking like, Denio is here locally, but

2957
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:37,000
PlayStation's everywhere

2958
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:39,000
there are PSPs everywhere, and if you

2959
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:41,000
really... Even the actual PlayStation 1s

2960
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:43,000
I wouldn't, yeah

2961
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:45,000
yeah, PlayStation 1s, but I mean

2962
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:47,000
on the go, I mean PlayStation 1's not very

2963
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:49,000
you know, portable

2964
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:51,000
I mean, you could technically do it

2965
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:53,000
with a battery pack and stuff, but it's

2966
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:55,000
I seem to remember some little screen

2967
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:57,000
they have the screen, no, they do have

2968
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:59,000
the screen, and they're used for hacking

2969
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:01,000
stuff quite a bit, they're definitely

2970
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:03,000
used for portable consoles

2971
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:05,000
more than the actual, you know

2972
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:07,000
PlayStation 1, but I mean seriously

2973
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:09,000
you just buy a PSP and just play your

2974
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:11,000
PlayStation 1 games on there if you really want to do it

2975
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:13,000
and that way you don't get locked into a contract and you don't

2976
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:15,000
need to buy this expensive phone for it

2977
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:17,000
but I mean, people like gaming on the

2978
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:19,000
phone, and here's my

2979
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:21,000
thing, it's like, you know, it's good

2980
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:23,000
that they have these buttons, but are all

2981
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:25,000
the developers really using it? No, they

2982
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:27,000
are not, so, you know, don't expect

2983
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:29,000
to buy this and go all of a sudden, oh hey, now I can

2984
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:31,000
play Mega Man 2 or something like that

2985
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:33,000
really easily

2986
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:35,000
using the buttons, because you're

2987
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:37,000
not going to be able to

2988
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:39,000
I don't know, it's

2989
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:41,000
whatever, I mean

2990
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:43,000
if you want to do this, this is something for you

2991
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:45,000
just, you know, know it's out there now

2992
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:47,000
Misty in our chatroom says, speaking of

2993
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:49,000
iPhones, someone needs to get theirs away from a mic

2994
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:51,000
Jamie

2995
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:53,000
I'm dealing something with Dan

2996
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:55,000
oh, well still, it's

2997
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:57,000
I moved it, look, it's over here

2998
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:59,000
and you know, whenever

2999
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:01,000
anybody hears that doo doo doo tone

3000
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:03,000
like everybody looks at their, any iPhone owner

3001
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:05,000
whenever that, there's some commercial on the radio

3002
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:07,000
that uses that tone and it's terrible

3003
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:09,000
I don't do that because my volume on my

3004
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:11,000
iPod is turned off, and also

3005
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:13,000
my iPod is turned off

3006
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:15,000
like a normal person would

3007
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:17,000
iPhone people

3008
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:19,000
crazy

3009
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:21,000
well, maybe my mommy needs to contact me

3010
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:23,000
in an emergency

3011
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:25,000
my husband's two states away, so

3012
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:27,000
I'm trying to keep in touch with him

3013
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:29,000
no, I understand that, that's no problem, but I'm just saying, you know

3014
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:33,000
yeah, I don't know what you're saying, alright

3015
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:37,000
alright, let's move on to another story about

3016
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:39,000
Ultima, I mentioned earlier in the show

3017
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:41,000
Ultima Online randomly got brought up

3018
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:43,000
well, there are some rumors going around

3019
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:45,000
that Ultima could quite possibly be coming back

3020
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:47,000
but I don't know, this is stretching a little bit guys

3021
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:49,000
here's the deal, Ultima 4

3022
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:51,000
has been available online

3023
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:53,000
through these various websites

3024
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:55,000
Abandonware or Flash

3025
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:57,000
emulators and so forth, GOG maybe

3026
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:59,000
yeah, well no, not even GOG, I'm talking like

3027
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:01,000
illegal means to play

3028
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:03,000
Ultima 4, but you know how like a lot of that

3029
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:05,000
Abandonware, the whole theory behind it is

3030
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:07,000
well, after so many, even though it's like total

3031
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:09,000
BS, after so many years you lose the right

3032
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:11,000
no, companies don't ever lose the rights to them

3033
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:13,000
it's just that they just bank on

3034
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:15,000
people are going to stop caring after

3035
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:17,000
7 or 8 years or whatever the Abandonware sites say

3036
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:19,000
well, I guess these sites were hosting

3037
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:21,000
Ultima 4, and sites have been

3038
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:23,000
giving away that game

3039
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:25,000
since like the late 90's

3040
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:27,000
this game dates all the way back to 1985

3041
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:29,000
there was a version of it on the NES

3042
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:31,000
and that was one of the later releases

3043
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:33,000
Ultima 4 is an old ass game

3044
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:35,000
well, apparently what happened

3045
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:37,000
is that some of these sites that were hosting the game

3046
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:39,000
EA had them take

3047
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:41,000
down, there was like some

3048
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:43,000
cease and desist that went out there

3049
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:45,000
now, some people are thinking

3050
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:47,000
it's tied into this whole

3051
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:49,000
thing that Paul Barnett

3052
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:51,000
who is a creative director

3053
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:53,000
at BioWare and Mythic, he's a very

3054
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:55,000
RPG centered guy, he's been talking about a

3055
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:57,000
secret project which includes

3056
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:59,000
an all new MMO from EA

3057
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:01,000
so could it be that

3058
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:03,000
EA is trying to protect this old IP

3059
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:05,000
all of a sudden because

3060
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:07,000
they're about to announce a new Ultima MMO

3061
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:09,000
at E3, who knows

3062
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:11,000
so of course

3063
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:13,000
as brought up earlier in the show, Ultima Online

3064
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:15,000
has been out since 1997

3065
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:17,000
so it is a 14 year old game

3066
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:19,000
so maybe it's going to get an update

3067
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:21,000
and that could also explain this whole loyalty program thing

3068
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:23,000
coming out of the blue it seems like

3069
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:25,000
maybe like a last hurrah for Ultima Online

3070
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:27,000
before they're about to announce something big

3071
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:29,000
at E3, who knows

3072
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:31,000
and the last time that we heard something

3073
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:33,000
about this happening

3074
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:35,000
was the Sarian games

3075
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:37,000
that had all the Space Quest and King's Quest

3076
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:39,000
for Sierra Online available to play

3077
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:41,000
and then the

3078
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:43,000
the fandom game

3079
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:45,000
I'm blanking on the name

3080
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:47,000
Silver Lining, they got a C&D

3081
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:49,000
and we thought oh it's just you know

3082
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:51,000
Activision being horrible

3083
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:53,000
but no the Telltale

3084
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:55,000
Telltale got the King's Quest

3085
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:57,000
revamp license

3086
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:59,000
and it's like oh well maybe they weren't just being

3087
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:01,000
total assholes, there's actually a relevant reason

3088
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:03,000
for them to do those C&Ds

3089
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:05,000
because that happened just one or two months ago

3090
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:07,000
that gives me reason to believe

3091
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:09,000
this Ultima story can hold water

3092
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:11,000
very good point

3093
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:13,000
well we'll see what happens, I think E3 will be very telling

3094
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:15,000
this could be one of the big things they announce

3095
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:17,000
would there be interest in Ultima?

3096
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:19,000
Ultima was, that was a big Richard Garriott thing too

3097
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:21,000
remember that was like his baby

3098
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:25,000
I didn't actually own my own gaming PC

3099
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:27,000
or a PC period until like

3100
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:29,000
95, 96

3101
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:31,000
so all the Ultima stuff that came before

3102
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:33,000
I personally missed out on all of the Ultima stuff

3103
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:35,000
during the 80s

3104
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:37,000
see I owned 3 and 4 on the NES

3105
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:39,000
I owned both of them on the NES

3106
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:41,000
and they were great games

3107
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:43,000
well they were really hardcore

3108
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:45,000
they were not like Final Fantasy

3109
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:47,000
they were pretty in depth

3110
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:49,000
I think 3 had an amazing soundtrack too

3111
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:51,000
weren't they off a model of Dungeons and Dragons?

3112
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:53,000
Ultima Exodus

3113
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:55,000
was 3

3114
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:57,000
yeah because I tried playing that one

3115
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:59,000
I had it on Ness

3116
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:01,000
like the Cleric or the Druid

3117
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:03,000
there was like a million classes in it

3118
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:05,000
yeah that was Ultima and then there was Ultima Quest of the Avatar

3119
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:07,000
which was a little more

3120
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:09,000
but see those games are really not like their PC counterparts

3121
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:11,000
they were really

3122
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:13,000
I don't want to say dumbed down but they were really changed

3123
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:15,000
for the NES

3124
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:17,000
mine ended up under a lawn mower

3125
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:19,000
not my fault

3126
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:21,000
poor game

3127
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:23,000
I found it in my front yard after

3128
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:25,000
trying to find it and it was under a lawn mower

3129
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:27,000
there was Ultima 5

3130
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:29,000
on the NES as well

3131
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:31,000
and I think Ultima 7 I played on the PC

3132
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:33,000
that was Pagan right?

3133
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:35,000
there was one big one that

3134
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:37,000
7, 8 or 9 I don't know had a lot of hype

3135
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:39,000
to it

3136
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:41,000
well they all had some hype to them

3137
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:43,000
but now Richard Garriott is long gone

3138
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:45,000
he's not dead or anything

3139
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:47,000
but he went off and did Tabula Rasa

3140
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:49,000
which tanked unfortunately for him

3141
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:51,000
that was the whole space MMO

3142
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:53,000
it was not free

3143
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:55,000
it was an NCSoft pay game

3144
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:57,000
I played it once

3145
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:59,000
it was alright but it was more like a shooter type game

3146
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:01,000
and yeah that didn't go over so well

3147
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:03,000
well maybe after that whole debacle

3148
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:05,000
failed maybe he's coming back and doing this

3149
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:07,000
who knows?

3150
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:09,000
could be a variety of things

3151
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:11,000
alright let's get to the mailbag

3152
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:13,000
every week we invite your emails at

3153
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:15,000
mailbag.orangelaungeradio.com

3154
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:17,000
and our soccer is going to dive into the email bag head first

3155
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:19,000
and pull out a couple emails that she thinks are worth

3156
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:21,000
sharing with us tonight

3157
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:23,000
I found some sticky ones

3158
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:25,000
first email

3159
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:27,000
last week you mentioned Sony changing over divisions

3160
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:29,000
for their network services

3161
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:31,000
I oddly got an email regarding this change

3162
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:33,000
but the contents of the email smelled of a phishing scam

3163
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:35,000
the sender appears to be from

3164
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:37,000
playstation underscore network

3165
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:39,000
at playstation dot

3166
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:41,000
enovix dot net

3167
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:43,000
I haven't followed the links in the email

3168
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:45,000
which simply mentions the change

3169
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:47,000
the need to enter into new terms of service

3170
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:49,000
and the link where my Sony online services settings

3171
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:51,000
can be updated

3172
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:53,000
the change has been confirmed as being legitimate

3173
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:55,000
am I simply being paranoid about this email

3174
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:57,000
Robert M

3175
02:08:57,000 --> 02:08:59,000
no I think you have a right to question those types of emails

3176
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:01,000
exactly and also I don't think

3177
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:03,000
that they are actually having you agree to those terms

3178
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:05,000
of services through

3179
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:07,000
through that I got an email

3180
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:09,000
I think I just ignored it

3181
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:11,000
because I did get an email but the

3182
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:13,000
minute I went back into the PS3 I played PS3

3183
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:15,000
just a couple days ago I think after the first

3184
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:17,000
because this is when we were playing Mortal Combat

3185
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:19,000
it was Friday right? and it made me

3186
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:21,000
accept the terms of service when I signed in

3187
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:23,000
so that will all happen through your

3188
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:25,000
playstation so don't do anything with

3189
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:27,000
email I was watching Supernatural on

3190
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:29,000
Friday night and it didn't have

3191
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:31,000
me do anything

3192
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:33,000
maybe you weren't connecting

3193
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:35,000
to the interwebs idk

3194
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:37,000
might be

3195
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:39,000
ok next email

3196
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:41,000
note

3197
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:43,000
the following letter has been mirrored posted to the

3198
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:45,000
Sims 3 online forums

3199
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:47,000
and this is also titled by the way

3200
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:49,000
empirical response to the Dragon Age 2 protest letter

3201
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:51,000
dear sirs

3202
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:53,000
in the past week I've been playing a lot of the game

3203
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:55,000
The Sims 3 on my iPad

3204
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:57,000
I like most of the game however there is one element of the game

3205
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:59,000
that absolutely offends me

3206
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:01,000
in the game you can make different meals for yourself

3207
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:03,000
and whoever you happen to be living with

3208
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:05,000
at the point in the game

3209
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:07,000
among the meal options you can choose from

3210
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:09,000
is vegetable soup

3211
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:11,000
this option deeply offends me

3212
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:13,000
as an ardent carnivore I eat meat with every meal

3213
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:15,000
every! I eat meat with breakfast

3214
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:17,000
meat with lunch, meat with afternoon snack, meat with dinner

3215
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:19,000
meat with my late night snack

3216
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:21,000
I eat meat like it's going out of style which after

3217
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:23,000
going to my local whole foods it just might be

3218
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:25,000
the option of eating vegetable soup

3219
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:27,000
offends me as I feel meat should be not

3220
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:29,000
only an option of what to eat at meals

3221
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:31,000
it should be THE option

3222
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:33,000
now why should you listen to me? what does my opinion matter?

3223
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:35,000
my opinion matters because as a ginger

3224
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:37,000
mere asthmatic pudgy impotent male

3225
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:39,000
I represent the majority of gamers

3226
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:41,000
and if I don't fuck it my opinion

3227
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:43,000
is sacrosanct and my mommy

3228
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:45,000
says I'm special

3229
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:47,000
I make this promise, if The Sims 3 is not updated

3230
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:49,000
to take the portion of eating vegetable soup

3231
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:51,000
out of the game I will post an online petition

3232
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:53,000
that will surely be signed by many of the gamers

3233
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:55,000
who identify and agree with me

3234
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:57,000
online petitions are no joke, think of all the things

3235
02:10:57,000 --> 02:10:59,000
that have changed because of online petitions

3236
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:01,000
think of it, you're truly redertainment

3237
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:03,000
satire over

3238
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:05,000
this message has been brought to you by the tachymeter

3239
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:07,000
that collection of numbers

3240
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:09,000
on the outside of your

3241
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:11,000
tachometer

3242
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:13,000
that you have no idea what the fuck it's there for

3243
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:15,000
tachymeter is on your car

3244
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:17,000
to show you your rpms, right?

3245
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:19,000
so

3246
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:21,000
yeah, I thought the parody though

3247
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:23,000
was pretty funny, I mean it's

3248
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:25,000
pretty right on

3249
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:27,000
I lulled

3250
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:29,000
so what's the name of the guy from Bioware that did that old

3251
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:31,000
the David

3252
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:33,000
David something

3253
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:35,000
Spader?

3254
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:37,000
no, that's an actor

3255
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:39,000
yeah, he's an actor

3256
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:41,000
there's an online petition

3257
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:43,000
to get him fired because

3258
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:45,000
I guess the same

3259
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:47,000
sex options the NPCs in Dragon

3260
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:49,000
Age 2, whether it be the female

3261
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:51,000
what's her name, the Meryl?

3262
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:53,000
yeah, well the

3263
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:55,000
elf girl Meryl, yeah

3264
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:57,000
and then also the male equivalent which I guess are the easier

3265
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:59,000
options to hit on if you want to do

3266
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:01,000
well I guess the person that put up this

3267
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:03,000
petition is like, oh well this is just

3268
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:05,000
stereotyping

3269
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:07,000
gay and lesbian men and women as

3270
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:09,000
aggressive sex

3271
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:11,000
fiends but I think Meryl

3272
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:13,000
will hit on you no matter what gender you

3273
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:15,000
are okay, but just

3274
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:17,000
and so will, I think

3275
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:19,000
is Varick the dwarf

3276
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:21,000
guy? yeah, I think they're just

3277
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:23,000
set to be attracted to

3278
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:25,000
the main person yeah

3279
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:27,000
but I just thought it was funny that

3280
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:29,000
he had put out that response to that

3281
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:31,000
one idiot guy who wrote in

3282
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:33,000
but there's also just a petition to get him

3283
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:35,000
fired because I guess the gay and lesbian characters are

3284
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:37,000
horny that's butt-tarded

3285
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:39,000
if anyone's horny

3286
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:41,000
it's Isabella I found it

3287
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:43,000
here's the petition, it's on petition

3288
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:45,000
spot.com please don't visit it

3289
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:47,000
it says fire David Gator for

3290
02:12:47,000 --> 02:13:09,000
stereotyping gays

3291
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:19,000
at me when I never found any interest

3292
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:21,000
or even flirted with him this sort of thing shows

3293
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:23,000
that gays are unable to be normal people

3294
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:25,000
think nothing about sex

3295
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:27,000
this is the type of garbage that has people

3296
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:29,000
believe gays shouldn't serve in the military

3297
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:31,000
we are human beings that

3298
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:33,000
are the same as everyone else please sign

3299
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:35,000

3300
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:37,000

Meryl for example and she's

3306
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:49,000
hitting on my female rogue

3307
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:51,000
but in the male scenario she hits on

3308
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:53,000
the male rogue too and you

3309
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:55,000

02:13:57,000 --> 02:13:59,000

have a problem with what you're doing

3366
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:49,000
this is people looking for drama where there is none

3367
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:51,000

3368
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:53,000
in your life that you have to make drama to be upset

3369
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:55,000
about seriously

3370
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:57,000
the world is not about you

3371
02:15:57,000 --> 02:15:59,000

02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:01,000

this on my iphone so if there are any weird

3382
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:21,000

02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:23,000
ok

3384
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:25,000
a while ago I emailed asking

3385
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:27,000
if either the olr crew or

3386
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:29,000
anyone in the chat room knew of any video game

3387
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:31,000
characters who wear knitted clothing like

3388
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:33,000
riku scarf in final fantasy 10 2

3389
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:35,000
or nora estheim's

3390
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:37,000
sweater in final fantasy 13

3391
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:39,000
I'm still looking for suggestions

3392
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:41,000
but I found another character

3393
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:43,000
final fantasy 3's lunath some purple sweater

3394
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:45,000
under his jacket that's true

3395
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:47,000
sky requested that I send some

3396
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:49,000
pics of past projects I've included some of

3397
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:51,000
my past works the gray afghan I'm working

3398
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:53,000
on now and that green scarf

3399
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:55,000
also doubled as a shawl for this

3400
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:57,000
petite model I'm looking forward

3401
02:16:57,000 --> 02:16:59,000
for suggestions on video

3402
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:01,000
game characters knitted attire so let me know you should

3403
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:03,000
totally knit me stuff

3404
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:05,000
can you knit a mobius scarf?

3405
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:07,000
cause I totally want one anyway

3406
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:09,000
on a completely random note the other night I had

3407
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:11,000
a really screwed up dream where the three olr

3408
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:13,000
hosts were included oh I don't know

3409
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:15,000
I'm afraid for some reason we were

3410
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:17,000
in some everglades slash marsh looking

3411
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:19,000
place and me and dark sakura

3412
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:21,000
were in one dune buggy and loki and sky were

3413
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:23,000
in another following us a building

3414
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:25,000
to our left exploded like a balloon filled with

3415
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:27,000
water as we drove by it for some

3416
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:29,000
reason they veered off the path and were following

3417
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:31,000
a higher path that swerved in and out of the main

3418
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:33,000
that we were on

3419
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:35,000
there was a small ditch in the path

3420
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:37,000
and we fell a little and hit a curb

3421
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:39,000
and achieved some air time like we were in

3422
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:41,000
some dukes of hazard chase

3423
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:43,000
all four of us eventually reached our path

3424
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:45,000
which was my parents home

3425
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:47,000
which was bizarre cause they were white and I'm filipino

3426
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:49,000
we started

3427
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:51,000
getting chewed up by mosquitoes which

3428
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:53,000
woke I guess which means

3429
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:55,000
I woke up all itchy for some reason

3430
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:57,000
yeah I know totally random thanks

3431
02:17:57,000 --> 02:17:59,000
for humoring me stan

3432
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:01,000
don't eat

3433
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:03,000
before you go to bed

3434
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:05,000
they make you dream

3435
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:07,000
weird shit or don't take night

3436
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:09,000
don't sleep with night quilt

3437
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:11,000
tonight on the

3438
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:13,000

3439
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:15,000
video game show we're gonna

3440
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:17,000
talk about how to knit

3441
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:19,000
a nice little scarf no I think this stuff is

3442
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:21,000
kinda neat actually

3443
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:23,000
we're there taking this

3444
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:25,000
one step further into the

3445
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:27,000
whole you know

3446
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:29,000
making tangible

3447
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:31,000
goods from video game inspired

3448
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:33,000
stuff and I know dark soccer you're really into

3449
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:35,000
this I'm surprised there aren't more people

3450
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:37,000
that kinda like crochet the whole like

3451
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:39,000
8 bit patterns using the

3452
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:41,000
old sprite graphics to like

3453
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:43,000
make those what are those things the

3454
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:45,000
needle point or whatever this is gonna be a

3455
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:47,000
beret yeah but I'm

3456
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:49,000
talking about like can't you like stitch a

3457
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:51,000
like sprite into those

3458
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:53,000
um you theoretically

3459
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:55,000
could on a crocheted item you just need

3460
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:57,000
the grid but um Becky does

3461
02:18:57,000 --> 02:18:59,000
um needle point

3462
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:01,000
and then there's cross stitch

3463
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:03,000
I think in a recent issue

3464
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:05,000
of the official World of Warcraft

3465
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:07,000
magazine they feature a fan

3466
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:09,000
who does handmade plushies

3467
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:11,000
that are very intricate and exquisitely

3468
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:13,000
done she's not allowed to sell

3469
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:15,000
them but because they're so good

3470
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:17,000
they gave her a pictorial in the

3471
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:19,000
magazine so she makes like moonkin plushies

3472
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:21,000

3473
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:23,000
fabric and does it all I want a walrus

kolok or whatever

3502
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:21,000
and it is just so fantastic

3503
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:23,000
radio that was amazing radio

3504
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:25,000
let's look at some pictures together guys

3505
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:27,000
and there's a scarf

3506
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:29,000
and a pretty lady wearing it

3507
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:31,000
my chair has decided

3508
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:33,000
that it doesn't want to stay up anymore

3509
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:35,000
oh this is like his model

3510
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:37,000
yeah look at that

3511
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:39,000
and

3512
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:41,000
she kind of looks like she's been crying though don't be sad

3513
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:43,000
this red eye is from the camera Rob

3514
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:45,000
from back here it looks like

3515
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:47,000
she's been crying don't be crying

3516
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:49,000
it needs color correction

3517
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:51,000
photoshop please

3518
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:53,000
alright let's move on

3519
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:55,000
oh here's the last one

3520
02:20:55,000 --> 02:20:57,000
that's actually cool kind of like a houndstooth

3521
02:20:57,000 --> 02:20:59,000
alright last email

3522
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:01,000
dun dun dun

3523
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:03,000
hi OLR seeing as the mailbag

3524
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:05,000
has been rather light as of late I thought I'd send

3525
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:07,000
an email for the upcoming show

3526
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:09,000
I just wanted to touch on a few subjects but I'll try to

3527
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:11,000
keep this email from going on too long

3528
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:13,000
you failed

3529
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:15,000
wall of words from back here

3530
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:17,000
wall of words

3531
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:19,000
wall of words crits you for 9,000 hit points

3532
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:21,000
hush hush hush

3533
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:23,000
first off

3534
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:25,000
as of the time I typed this on Thursday afternoon

3535
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:27,000
there's no notable free videos on the

3536
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:29,000
PSN video store

3537
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:31,000
if something were to be added between now and when

3538
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:33,000
the OLR airs

3539
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:35,000
or the OLR now

3540
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:37,000
I'll mention it either in chat or via Twitter topics

3541
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:39,000
although there's nothing good

3542
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:41,000
that's free so far I should mention

3543
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:43,000
that the PSN video store does have

3544
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:45,000
a petty decent

3545
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:47,000
I'm sure you meant pretty decent

3546
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:49,000
sale going on for the outright

3547
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:51,000
purchase of

3548
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:53,000
SD versions of miscellaneous comedy

3549
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:55,000
movies such as Airplane, Disaster Movie

3550
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:57,000
Joe Dirt, RV, Team America

3551
02:21:57,000 --> 02:21:59,000
several MST3K titles, etc.

3552
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:01,000
as well as three stand-up

3553
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:03,000
comedy specials and select seasons of Super

3554
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:05,000
Jail, Aqua Teen Hunger Force

3555
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:07,000
and the anime series called

3556
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:09,000
Durarara the Complete Series

3557
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:11,000
excuse you

3558
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:13,000
the movies and stand-up specials are normally

3559
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:15,000
$10 while the other stuff is normally

3560
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:17,000
$2 but during the sale they're half

3561
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:19,000
off

3562
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:21,000
touch you

3563
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:23,000
on the subject of video stores I've noticed that the

3564
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:25,000
XBL-Zune video marketplace has been updated

3565
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:27,000
to include a new tab specifically

3566
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:29,000
for free TV shows, sneak previews, etc.

3567
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:31,000
this should be very helpful

3568
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:33,000
that stuff has been gooped

3569
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:35,000
grouped together

3570
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:37,000
in one place

3571
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:39,000
rather than having to hunt around

3572
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:41,000
for it at all

3573
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:43,000
lastly I want to

3574
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:45,000
touch on the PS3 version of Free Realms

3575
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:47,000
which has been released via PSN this past

3576
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:49,000
Tuesday although I haven't put enough time

3577
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:51,000
into it to give a full fair review

3578
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:53,000
of it I'd at least would like to give my

3579
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:55,000
early impressions of it which are mixed

3580
02:22:55,000 --> 02:22:57,000
frankly there's a few couple

3581
02:22:57,000 --> 02:22:59,000
a few a couple things hurting it

3582
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:01,000
was it a few or a couple?

3583
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:03,000
the game seriously needs a manual be it

3584
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:05,000
a PDF printed one or

3585
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:07,000
in-game which isn't included

3586
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:09,000
some things are easy to figure out while others are

3587
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:11,000
bigger pain in the ass than an appointment with

3588
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:13,000
one's proctologist

3589
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:15,000
while the game is a

3590
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:17,000
freemium title and trophies are supported

3591
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:19,000
you must have a subscription to unlock any trophies

3592
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:21,000
Sony kinda neglected to mention

3593
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:23,000
that early on and the only time they really

3594
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:25,000
said anything was in response to a question

3595
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:27,000
in the comment section to a

3596
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:29,000
post on the Playstation blog

3597
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:31,000
in terms of the

3598
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:33,000
game's overall appearance it can

3599
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:35,000
best be described as if Mr. Rogers

3600
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:37,000
had made a stew out of Barney the

3601
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:39,000
Teletubbies most Nickelodeon cartoons and the Power Rangers

3602
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:41,000
ate said stew then vomited

3603
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:43,000
all over a unicorn a bunny

3604
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:45,000
infested World of Warcraft

3605
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:47,000
whether this is a positive or negative

3606
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:49,000
is purely subjective and impersonal preference

3607
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:51,000
this email has been brought to you

3608
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:53,000
by Nyquil capital N small y big

3609
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:55,000
fucking Q Nyquil Nyquil Nyquil

3610
02:23:55,000 --> 02:23:57,000
we love you you giant fucking Q

3611
02:23:57,000 --> 02:23:59,000
see Dark Sakura I can quote

3612
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:01,000
Dennis Leary too

3613
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:03,000
that's it

3614
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:05,000
well

3615
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:07,000
I guess somebody kind of agrees with me on

3616
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:09,000
free realms

3617
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:11,000
that it's a horrible

3618
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:13,000
piece of crap game that makes

3619
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:15,000
no sense that you have no

3620
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:17,000
idea what to do not that there's anything wrong with that

3621
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:19,000
no I'm kidding I call it the

3622
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:21,000
sphincter of MMOs it's not the worst game

3623
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:23,000
I've ever played but it's just not good

3624
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:25,000
the sphincter of MMOs it's not

3625
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:27,000
the crap that comes out I don't know if it's the sphincter

3626
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:29,000
but it's definitely like the upper

3627
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:31,000
intestine

3628
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:33,000
well my reason for saying the sphincter

3629
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:35,000
is because it's not the crap

3630
02:24:35,000 --> 02:24:37,000
it's just where the crap comes from

3631
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:39,000
okay you win

3632
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:41,000
let's get angsty

3633
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:43,000
do some angry rawr

3634
02:24:43,000 --> 02:25:01,000
FUs of the week

3635
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:03,000
my FU goes towards the

3636
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:05,000
repaving of the sidewalk

3637
02:25:05,000 --> 02:25:07,000
the street outside of my house

3638
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:09,000
because they're closing the street tomorrow

3639
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:11,000
and Tuesday from

3640
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:13,000
I wanna say 7 in the morning

3641
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:15,000
until 5 in the afternoon

3642
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:17,000
and

3643
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:19,000
I really shouldn't have to leave my house

3644
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:21,000
until like 9 to get to school

3645
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:23,000
because I'm making up time at school

3646
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:25,000
and instead I have to

3647
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:27,000
park my house a block away at

3648
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:29,000
my friend's house so that I could

3649
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:31,000
walk to my car in the morning and then go to school

3650
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:33,000
which is not that far I'm not complaining about walking

3651
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:35,000
but I complain about

3652
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:37,000
walking that I shouldn't have to do

3653
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:39,000
they should do this like

3654
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:41,000
at night

3655
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:43,000
with sound mufflers around them

3656
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:47,000
or they should give us money to be in communities

3657
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:49,000
but I guess we're getting any road out of this whatever

3658
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:51,000
money rocks

3659
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:53,000
Loki!

3660
02:25:53,000 --> 02:25:55,000
um

3661
02:25:55,000 --> 02:25:57,000
I don't know there's not a whole lot that I'm really mad about

3662
02:25:57,000 --> 02:25:59,000
just I guess FU to lack of sleep

3663
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:01,000
because I haven't been getting a lot of sleep

3664
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:03,000
I have to wake up way early in the morning

3665
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:05,000
and

3666
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:07,000
you know one or two days isn't bad

3667
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:09,000
I've been doing it for 8 months straight now

3668
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:11,000
uh

3669
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:13,000
it takes a toll on you it makes you go a little crazy

3670
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:15,000
oh you were already

3671
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:17,000
crazy Loki

3672
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:19,000
I know and just compounded on top of that

3673
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:21,000
um

3674
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:23,000
I don't know I think it's been pretty good for me

3675
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:25,000
I don't really have a lot to say FU to do

3676
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:27,000
so yes FU to ants

3677
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:29,000
oh little bastards

3678
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:31,000
I hate them that's a good one thank you

3679
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:33,000
how about you?

3680
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:35,000
even if it's for really good reasons

3681
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:37,000
like a new job

3682
02:26:37,000 --> 02:26:39,000
or you know

3683
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:41,000
just a new beginning or whatever

3684
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:43,000
the process of moving

3685
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:45,000
as an adult is one of the most

3686
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:47,000
annoying bullshitty things a grown

3687
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:49,000
person can do to themselves

3688
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:51,000
you've got to change your address

3689
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:53,000
get the stupid postal

3690
02:26:53,000 --> 02:26:55,000
card pack up everything you own

3691
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:57,000
get friends to help you move

3692
02:26:57,000 --> 02:26:59,000
even if

3693
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:01,000
it's awesome and nothing goes wrong

3694
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:03,000
moving is bullshit

3695
02:27:03,000 --> 02:27:05,000
there you go

3696
02:27:05,000 --> 02:27:07,000
moving is hard

3697
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:09,000
it's for grown ups

3698
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:11,000
no it stinks I don't like it

3699
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:13,000
anyhow that's it for the FUs of the week

3700
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:15,000
let's move on to a couple more stories

3701
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:17,000
and then your calls at 1877

3702
02:27:17,000 --> 02:27:19,000
game OLR

3703
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:21,000
as if we didn't need more

3704
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:23,000
reasons to believe that there's gonna be

3705
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:25,000
a new Grand Theft Auto announced at E3

3706
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:27,000
uh

3707
02:27:27,000 --> 02:27:29,000
well there's been a casting call for

3708
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:31,000
people to

3709
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:33,000
do some character

3710
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:35,000
voice over work and one of those

3711
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:37,000
characters happens to be from the Grand Theft Auto

3712
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:39,000
universe including

3713
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:41,000
the guy's name is James

3714
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:43,000
Pettison

3715
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:45,000
and he was a

3716
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:47,000
guess aside character

3717
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:49,000
at least in San Andreas

3718
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:51,000
where he openly

3719
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:53,000
recounted acts of pedophilia

3720
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:55,000
and in Grand Theft Auto 4

3721
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:57,000
he was arrested by the Indonesian police

3722
02:27:57,000 --> 02:27:59,000
after being suspected of child molestation

3723
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:01,000
in Bali

3724
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:03,000
so

3725
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:05,000
yeah now apparently

3726
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:07,000
he's coming back in the next game and

3727
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:09,000
someone's gonna be doing the voice for him

3728
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:11,000
some other characters they name

3729
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:13,000
as well they're pretty generic sounding

3730
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:15,000
Samantha a young female

3731
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:17,000
obsessed with sex parties always dreaming

3732
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:19,000
of being a Hollywood celebrity

3733
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:21,000
um

3734
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:23,000
also let's see here

3735
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:25,000
uh

3736
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:27,000
uh

3737
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:29,000
what else there were some other characters

3738
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:31,000
I thought they were talking about too as well

3739
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:33,000
um a lot of like weird stuff

3740
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:35,000
um

3741
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:37,000
but yeah so probably

3742
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:39,000
new game coming out I would not be surprised

3743
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:41,000
next year so

3744
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:43,000
exciting I love it

3745
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:45,000
and the rumor is

3746
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:47,000
that it's supposed to be going back to Los Santos which

3747
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:49,000
was from San Andreas probably

3748
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:51,000
one of the best Grand Theft Auto games ever

3749
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:53,000
so I think a new

3750
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:55,000
Grand Theft Auto game is kind of a given so

3751
02:28:55,000 --> 02:28:57,000
San Andreas was an analog

3752
02:28:57,000 --> 02:28:59,000
of LA in that game

3753
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:01,000
Los Santos was

3754
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:03,000
Las Vegas or no? No, Los Santos

3755
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:05,000
was part of San Andreas remember cause there's three

3756
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:07,000
cities in San Andreas it was

3757
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:09,000
Los Santos, San Friere

3758
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:11,000
and Las Venturas

3759
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:13,000
Las Vegas

3760
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:15,000
yeah Vegas, San Francisco

3761
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:17,000
and Los Angeles

3762
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:19,000
yeah

3763
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:21,000
but that game was massive

3764
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:23,000
I have to really go back and play it

3765
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:25,000
get back from my sister

3766
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:27,000
why not wait for the next one?

3767
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:29,000
if you have a gaming PC get it on

3768
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:31,000
Steam for like five bucks and it's a lot better

3769
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:33,000
I have it on PC the last

3770
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:35,000
PC I tried running it on was my old laptop

3771
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:37,000
and that thing is a piece of shit I could probably run it on this

3772
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:39,000
really well

3773
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:41,000
but you know I've got it on

3774
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:43,000
I've got the old

3775
02:29:43,000 --> 02:29:45,000
hot coffee disc

3776
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:47,000
from the Playstation 2

3777
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:49,000
my sister's been borrowing it forever

3778
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:51,000
and you know even though she doesn't need to

3779
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:53,000
cause there's a rip on the hard drive of that Playstation 2

3780
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:55,000
she has

3781
02:29:55,000 --> 02:29:57,000
so I just need to get back and play it on my

3782
02:29:57,000 --> 02:29:59,000
generation 1 Playstation 3 full backwards compatibility

3783
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:01,000
oh yeah

3784
02:30:01,000 --> 02:30:03,000
alright

3785
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:05,000
well one more story for you guys before we get to the phone calls

3786
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:07,000
and this is about a man named Phil Fish

3787
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:09,000
and you might not know that game

3788
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:11,000
or you might not know that name but he is making the game

3789
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:13,000
Fez it's an indie game

3790
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:15,000
and it's going to be coming out on Xbox Live Arcade

3791
02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:17,000
possibly the PC and the Playstation 3

3792
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:19,000
but probably not the Wii

3793
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:21,000
in an interview with

3794
02:30:21,000 --> 02:30:23,000
Destructoid he was quoted saying

3795
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:25,000
quote right now we're only concentrating

3796
02:30:25,000 --> 02:30:27,000
on XBLA which makes the most sense

3797
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:29,000
for us at the time

3798
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:31,000
PC and Playstation Network would also make a lot of sense

3799
02:30:31,000 --> 02:30:33,000
but in my opinion WiiWare just wouldn't be worth

3800
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:35,000
our time and effort

3801
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:37,000
it's a dismal system that I don't want to deal with

3802
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:39,000
neither as a customer nor a developer

3803
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:41,000
no demos? Fuck off

3804
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:43,000
and that's a quote from this guy

3805
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:45,000
who told the WiiWare system it can go fuck off

3806
02:30:45,000 --> 02:30:47,000
now granted this guy

3807
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:49,000
I don't want to say he's a nobody

3808
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:51,000
but his game hasn't really been proven yet

3809
02:30:51,000 --> 02:30:53,000
he's one of those garage developers

3810
02:30:53,000 --> 02:30:55,000
that Nintendo kind of doesn't want in their house anyway

3811
02:30:55,000 --> 02:30:57,000
so I don't know

3812
02:30:57,000 --> 02:30:59,000
if this story carries a lot of weight

3813
02:30:59,000 --> 02:31:01,000
but I mean the guy did kind of have

3814
02:31:01,000 --> 02:31:03,000
the balls to call out Nintendo

3815
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:05,000
but I kind of think it's not going to

3816
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:07,000
really change a goddamn thing in the scope of things

3817
02:31:07,000 --> 02:31:09,000
but he really does have a point

3818
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:11,000
why do people keep developing for WiiWare when it's kind of shit?

3819
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:13,000
exactly

3820
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:15,000
and as I posted on Twitter

3821
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:17,000
earlier this week

3822
02:31:17,000 --> 02:31:19,000
remember Nintendo was commenting

3823
02:31:19,000 --> 02:31:21,000
on how they wanted to make sure

3824
02:31:21,000 --> 02:31:23,000
they kept the garage developers out

3825
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:25,000
because in order to make sure

3826
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:27,000
that there's quality products coming out

3827
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:29,000
on WiiWare and DSiWare

3828
02:31:29,000 --> 02:31:31,000
and stuff like that

3829
02:31:31,000 --> 02:31:33,000
guess what came out on DSiWare this week?

3830
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:35,000
it was a program to take pictures of your friends

3831
02:31:35,000 --> 02:31:37,000
and put them in funny Halloween themed

3832
02:31:37,000 --> 02:31:39,000
backgrounds

3833
02:31:39,000 --> 02:31:41,000
it looked like shit

3834
02:31:41,000 --> 02:31:43,000
it looked like something that was on the iOS platform

3835
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:45,000
yay, clip art

3836
02:31:45,000 --> 02:31:47,000
Halloween themed?

3837
02:31:47,000 --> 02:31:49,000
I'm sorry, monster themed stuff

3838
02:31:49,000 --> 02:31:51,000
I'm sorry, the best one on the iPhone

3839
02:31:51,000 --> 02:31:53,000
was that heroin

3840
02:31:53,000 --> 02:31:55,000
yeah, that was funny

3841
02:31:55,000 --> 02:31:57,000
the make your friends fat application

3842
02:31:57,000 --> 02:31:59,000
is funny too

3843
02:31:59,000 --> 02:32:01,000
it was absolutely terrible

3844
02:32:01,000 --> 02:32:03,000
and perfect week to come out

3845
02:32:03,000 --> 02:32:05,000
right after they said

3846
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:07,000
oh, we need to make sure quality is on there

3847
02:32:07,000 --> 02:32:09,000
that's some quality shit right there

3848
02:32:09,000 --> 02:32:11,000
you're so much better

3849
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:13,000
than the iOS platform, what was I thinking

3850
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:15,000
even, you know, contemplating that you would

3851
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:17,000
ever allow something that terrible to be on

3852
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:19,000
your network

3853
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:21,000
oh, Nintendo, you don't need these garage

3854
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:23,000
developers at all, you got your Mario games

3855
02:32:23,000 --> 02:32:25,000
that you're rehashing and putting out

3856
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:27,000
whatever, that's fine, they're better off

3857
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:29,000
you know, not going to the WiiWare service

3858
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:31,000
but seriously, I mean, come on

3859
02:32:31,000 --> 02:32:33,000
demos, I mean, demos have been around

3860
02:32:33,000 --> 02:32:35,000
for fucking years now, and you can't

3861
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:37,000
implement demos on your WiiWare service

3862
02:32:37,000 --> 02:32:39,000
or you just don't want to because a lot of this shit

3863
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:41,000
is crap on there, and

3864
02:32:41,000 --> 02:32:43,000
it's just terrible games

3865
02:32:43,000 --> 02:32:45,000
oh, haha, you downloaded it too late

3866
02:32:45,000 --> 02:32:47,000
hahaha, Nintendo just kinda doesn't get

3867
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:49,000
online, I think it's the same story

3868
02:32:49,000 --> 02:32:51,000
every week, ok, they don't get online

3869
02:32:51,000 --> 02:32:53,000
and they don't have any demos

3870
02:32:53,000 --> 02:32:55,000
for Wii games, they don't have any

3871
02:32:55,000 --> 02:32:57,000
demos for any, I mean they had

3872
02:32:57,000 --> 02:32:59,000
demos one time for a select few

3873
02:32:59,000 --> 02:33:01,000
WiiWare games, so it is possible

3874
02:33:01,000 --> 02:33:03,000
they, eh, fuck it, we don't give a shit

3875
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:05,000
our customers don't need demos

3876
02:33:05,000 --> 02:33:07,000
our quality speaks for itself

3877
02:33:07,000 --> 02:33:09,000
it should be a no brainer, I must buy everything

3878
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:11,000
Nintendo

3879
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:13,000
the developers of

3880
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:15,000
Super Meat Boy, which I think is

3881
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:17,000
one of the most successful indie games since

3882
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:19,000
Braid really, the

3883
02:33:19,000 --> 02:33:21,000
two studios that were most willing to work with them

3884
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:23,000
was XBLA and Steam

3885
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:25,000
Sony wasn't really interested in the

3886
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:27,000
game, and when they wanted to put out a

3887
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:29,000
WiiWare edition of Super Meat Boy

3888
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:31,000
they were fine with the no demo thing, but just the

3889
02:33:31,000 --> 02:33:33,000
restrictions they had to put on the game

3890
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:35,000
really crippled it, they just cancelled the whole thing

3891
02:33:35,000 --> 02:33:37,000
because the WiiWare platform and how

3892
02:33:37,000 --> 02:33:39,000
big the game has to be was

3893
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:41,000
shitty. I mean, this is a company

3894
02:33:41,000 --> 02:33:43,000
that thinks that users

3895
02:33:43,000 --> 02:33:45,000
can't understand megabytes, they

3896
02:33:45,000 --> 02:33:47,000
have to, you know, put it

3897
02:33:47,000 --> 02:33:49,000
down to blocks, yeah, really, how is

3898
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:51,000
you know, five megabytes and

3899
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:53,000
five blocks any fucking different, I mean

3900
02:33:53,000 --> 02:33:55,000
other than being really confusing

3901
02:33:55,000 --> 02:33:57,000
to the fact that how many, you know

3902
02:33:57,000 --> 02:33:59,000
When you have 64 and you take

3903
02:33:59,000 --> 02:34:01,000
away two, you're left with

3904
02:34:01,000 --> 02:34:03,000
62. Yeah, but then you have to figure

3905
02:34:03,000 --> 02:34:05,000
out, okay, I have a two gigabyte memory card

3906
02:34:05,000 --> 02:34:07,000
that's in my, you know, 3DS

3907
02:34:07,000 --> 02:34:09,000
or in my Wii system, how many

3908
02:34:09,000 --> 02:34:11,000
fucking blocks is that?

3909
02:34:11,000 --> 02:34:13,000
I don't know.

3910
02:34:13,000 --> 02:34:15,000
No one knows. Is the 3DS still speaking

3911
02:34:15,000 --> 02:34:17,000
blocks? Yes it does. Oh god.

3912
02:34:17,000 --> 02:34:19,000
Yes, it

3913
02:34:19,000 --> 02:34:21,000
does, and because

3914
02:34:21,000 --> 02:34:23,000
I mean, come on, man, everybody's

3915
02:34:23,000 --> 02:34:25,000
using computers nowadays, everybody

3916
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:27,000
megabyte, the term megabyte's been

3917
02:34:27,000 --> 02:34:29,000
around forever.

3918
02:34:29,000 --> 02:34:31,000
Even if they don't, they have an 8 gig

3919
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:33,000
iPod, they know what 8 gig means,

3920
02:34:33,000 --> 02:34:35,000
you know, the terminology

3921
02:34:35,000 --> 02:34:37,000
is everywhere now. And even

3922
02:34:37,000 --> 02:34:39,000
still though, why is it so hard to, you

3923
02:34:39,000 --> 02:34:41,000
know, megabyte? Okay,

3924
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:43,000
well, I don't know what a megabyte

3925
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:45,000
is, but I know that I have this many

3926
02:34:45,000 --> 02:34:47,000
on this memory card.

3927
02:34:47,000 --> 02:34:49,000
How's that difficult?

3928
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:51,000
It's not, it really isn't, but

3929
02:34:51,000 --> 02:34:53,000
for whatever reason, they decided, let's

3930
02:34:53,000 --> 02:34:55,000
go ahead and do that again.

3931
02:34:55,000 --> 02:34:57,000
It's just like they make a lot of poor

3932
02:34:57,000 --> 02:34:59,000
decisions when it comes to different

3933
02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:01,000
software and features that they have on

3934
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:03,000
these systems. Whatever, you know what,

3935
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:05,000
Nintendo, you can play this game as long

3936
02:35:05,000 --> 02:35:07,000
as you want, and your system will be

3937
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:09,000
successful for a while, and eventually

3938
02:35:09,000 --> 02:35:11,000
you're gonna hit that slump again.

3939
02:35:11,000 --> 02:35:13,000
You're gonna hit that slump again, and

3940
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:15,000
then you're gonna be in fucking last

3941
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:17,000
place, and oh, all that shit, now you

3942
02:35:17,000 --> 02:35:19,000
gotta catch up again. So

3943
02:35:19,000 --> 02:35:21,000
ride the wave while you can, but

3944
02:35:21,000 --> 02:35:23,000
eventually it's gonna come crashing down.

3945
02:35:23,000 --> 02:35:25,000
Alright, well, let's

3946
02:35:25,000 --> 02:35:27,000
get to the Skype line. We're gonna open that

3947
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:29,000
on up, 1-877-GAME-OLR,

3948
02:35:29,000 --> 02:35:31,000
or our username on Skype is

3949
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:33,000
OrangeLoungeRadio. Give us a call,

3950
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:35,000
and we'll talk topics with you, if there's something

3951
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:37,000
you wanna cover that we've talked about earlier tonight, or

3952
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:39,000
maybe you wanna talk to us about something completely

3953
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:41,000
new. While we wait for some calls,

3954
02:35:41,000 --> 02:35:43,000
cause there is a bit of a delay, Loki, do you have any

3955
02:35:43,000 --> 02:35:45,000
last minute stories for us tonight? Yeah, I do have one

3956
02:35:45,000 --> 02:35:47,000
thing. Sony is looking to dismiss

3957
02:35:47,000 --> 02:35:49,000
the other OS lawsuit. Remember,

3958
02:35:49,000 --> 02:35:51,000
there was people suing Sony

3959
02:35:51,000 --> 02:35:53,000
for removing the other OS

3960
02:35:53,000 --> 02:35:55,000
in the Playstation 3. I thought they dismissed that a long time ago.

3961
02:35:55,000 --> 02:35:57,000
Well, no they didn't. It was actually going to courts and stuff.

3962
02:35:57,000 --> 02:35:59,000
But here's the twist now. Sony wants

3963
02:35:59,000 --> 02:36:01,000
access to all those people's hard

3964
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:03,000
drives that filed for the other

3965
02:36:03,000 --> 02:36:05,000
OS lawsuits, because they're saying

3966
02:36:05,000 --> 02:36:07,000
they may be part of a bigger hacker

3967
02:36:07,000 --> 02:36:09,000
conspiracy. Thank you! So basically

3968
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:11,000
they're saying everybody that wanted Linux

3969
02:36:11,000 --> 02:36:13,000
on their system, they're a hacker, and they're out to

3970
02:36:13,000 --> 02:36:15,000
destroy Sony. Wasn't the government

3971
02:36:15,000 --> 02:36:17,000
using it? Oh yeah, but they're hackers, and they're out

3972
02:36:17,000 --> 02:36:19,000
to destroy Sony. Why put that in

3973
02:36:19,000 --> 02:36:21,000
your system if you think that everybody's

3974
02:36:21,000 --> 02:36:23,000
hackers out to destroy Sony?

3975
02:36:23,000 --> 02:36:25,000
If Sony made the goddamn

3976
02:36:25,000 --> 02:36:27,000
system, why don't they just make some

3977
02:36:27,000 --> 02:36:29,000
program that lets them see what's in the system?

3978
02:36:29,000 --> 02:36:31,000
I'm sure they could do that remotely, like a whole

3979
02:36:31,000 --> 02:36:33,000
Skynet thing, right? It's just terrible, but here's the thing,

3980
02:36:33,000 --> 02:36:35,000
I mean, well, if you think about it though,

3981
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:37,000
if they made some sort of program and they had it

3982
02:36:37,000 --> 02:36:39,000
where you connected online to see that kind of stuff,

3983
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:41,000
that would update their system, and they

3984
02:36:41,000 --> 02:36:43,000
would be unable to have the other OS

3985
02:36:43,000 --> 02:36:45,000
in there, cause you can't update your system

3986
02:36:45,000 --> 02:36:47,000
anymore if you want to keep that.

3987
02:36:47,000 --> 02:36:49,000
But, the real,

3988
02:36:49,000 --> 02:36:51,000
well, one reason they wanted to see the hard drives

3989
02:36:51,000 --> 02:36:53,000
is to make sure that they actually did have other OS on,

3990
02:36:53,000 --> 02:36:55,000
and this is their Playstation 3 hard drives,

3991
02:36:55,000 --> 02:36:57,000
not their PCs. They wanted to make sure

3992
02:36:57,000 --> 02:36:59,000
they had other OS on there, but

3993
02:36:59,000 --> 02:37:01,000
at the same time though, and the judge doesn't understand,

3994
02:37:01,000 --> 02:37:03,000
is when you put other OS on there,

3995
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:05,000
it's now a computer, and

3996
02:37:05,000 --> 02:37:07,000
you need to go through the protocols

3997
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:09,000
for, you know, discovery for that kind of

3998
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:11,000
stuff where you have to have a third party company, look

3999
02:37:11,000 --> 02:37:13,000
at the stuff, not Sony, going through

4000
02:37:13,000 --> 02:37:15,000
and having full access to your

4001
02:37:15,000 --> 02:37:17,000
hard drive of your now computer.

4002
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:19,000
Alright, let's go to the phones. Hi, you're on Orange

4003
02:37:19,000 --> 02:37:21,000
Launch Radio, who's this? Hey, it's Ronma,

4004
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:23,000
what's up everyone? Your

4005
02:37:23,000 --> 02:37:25,000
audio, I have to hang up.

4006
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:27,000
There's some terrible, terrible feedback that you've got

4007
02:37:27,000 --> 02:37:29,000
going on, and he's probably sitting there going

4008
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:31,000
why did he hang up on us? But you've got some,

4009
02:37:31,000 --> 02:37:33,000
I know you all heard that, right?

4010
02:37:33,000 --> 02:37:35,000
Yeah, ow. So,

4011
02:37:35,000 --> 02:37:37,000
you gotta fix that. Echo 123, buddy.

4012
02:37:37,000 --> 02:37:39,000
He works every other week, I wonder what's wrong with

4013
02:37:39,000 --> 02:37:41,000
tonight, let's see. Alright, let's try to go.

4014
02:37:41,000 --> 02:37:43,000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

4015
02:37:43,000 --> 02:37:45,000
Sledge and Zaku here. Hey Zaku, what's up, buddy?

4016
02:37:45,000 --> 02:37:47,000
Nothing much, just

4017
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:49,000
trying to recover for, you know, for a

4018
02:37:49,000 --> 02:37:51,000
sleepy Sunday night watching, you know, listening

4019
02:37:51,000 --> 02:37:53,000
to your show. But yeah,

4020
02:37:53,000 --> 02:37:55,000
just going on the debate of how Nintendo's

4021
02:37:55,000 --> 02:37:57,000
basically, like, you know, they're

4022
02:37:57,000 --> 02:37:59,000
basically like, they're basically

4023
02:37:59,000 --> 02:38:01,000
regressive at this point. I mean,

4024
02:38:01,000 --> 02:38:03,000
they're pissing off devs to, you know,

4025
02:38:03,000 --> 02:38:05,000
and it goes back to how

4026
02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:07,000
too much pride they have, like,

4027
02:38:07,000 --> 02:38:09,000
remember how they, like,

4028
02:38:09,000 --> 02:38:11,000
covertly, you know,

4029
02:38:11,000 --> 02:38:13,000
dissed, you know, the developers

4030
02:38:13,000 --> 02:38:15,000
of Angry Birds? Yes, I remember that.

4031
02:38:15,000 --> 02:38:17,000
The CEO actually, like,

4032
02:38:17,000 --> 02:38:19,000
he actually, you know, he didn't mention

4033
02:38:19,000 --> 02:38:21,000
it in a name, but he actually mentioned them

4034
02:38:21,000 --> 02:38:23,000
in, you know, within that same

4035
02:38:23,000 --> 02:38:25,000
aspect that they're just, like, bringing down

4036
02:38:25,000 --> 02:38:27,000
the wages. Kind of like,

4037
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:29,000
you know, it's kind of like those, uh, you ever

4038
02:38:29,000 --> 02:38:31,000
seen this episode of South Park where

4039
02:38:31,000 --> 02:38:33,000
the, you know, the Goobacks episode

4040
02:38:33,000 --> 02:38:35,000
and you see the guy shouting, they took our

4041
02:38:35,000 --> 02:38:37,000
job. They took our jobs! It's

4042
02:38:37,000 --> 02:38:39,000
pretty much like that. They're complaining about

4043
02:38:39,000 --> 02:38:41,000
how, just because it's a

4044
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:43,000
zero-sum game, well,

4045
02:38:43,000 --> 02:38:45,000
to them it appears to be a zero-sum game,

4046
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:47,000
that it's just, like,

4047
02:38:47,000 --> 02:38:49,000
it's not worth, it doesn't pay to be a

4048
02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:51,000
developer anymore. But on the other

4049
02:38:51,000 --> 02:38:53,000
hand,

4050
02:38:53,000 --> 02:38:55,000
Rovio, what their

4051
02:38:55,000 --> 02:38:57,000
strategy is, as long as they get Angry Birds

4052
02:38:57,000 --> 02:38:59,000
for a cheap price with a lot more

4053
02:38:59,000 --> 02:39:01,000
replay value, then

4054
02:39:01,000 --> 02:39:03,000
they've done their job in terms of getting

4055
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:05,000
people to play that game multiple

4056
02:39:05,000 --> 02:39:07,000
times. And even if you did

4057
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:09,000
the analytics, if you tracked the number of

4058
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:11,000
people just, like, launching the game and going

4059
02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:13,000
through levels, you would see

4060
02:39:13,000 --> 02:39:15,000
that it's a pretty, it's a pretty big

4061
02:39:15,000 --> 02:39:17,000
number. Even myself.

4062
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:19,000
Think of the shit-tons they're making, not just off the game

4063
02:39:19,000 --> 02:39:21,000
itself, but all the license tie-ins

4064
02:39:21,000 --> 02:39:23,000
now. I mean, maybe they have a plan on this thing again.

4065
02:39:23,000 --> 02:39:25,000
They have a free version on the

4066
02:39:25,000 --> 02:39:27,000
Android market that runs on ads alone.

4067
02:39:27,000 --> 02:39:29,000
How many impressions, you know,

4068
02:39:29,000 --> 02:39:31,000
how many impressions are that,

4069
02:39:31,000 --> 02:39:33,000
you know, through AdSense? That's a lot.

4070
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:35,000
That, you know, they make a

4071
02:39:35,000 --> 02:39:37,000
crap-ton of money instead of, you know, aside

4072
02:39:37,000 --> 02:39:39,000
from selling it for 99 cents,

4073
02:39:39,000 --> 02:39:41,000
which it pays for itself after a few plays.

4074
02:39:43,000 --> 02:39:45,000
So Nintendo's just threatened by that lower

4075
02:39:45,000 --> 02:39:47,000
price point? I mean, Nintendo also, God,

4076
02:39:47,000 --> 02:39:49,000
go in any Hot Topic,

4077
02:39:49,000 --> 02:39:51,000
and next to, like, one Angry Birds shirt,

4078
02:39:51,000 --> 02:39:53,000
you'll see, like, 20 Nintendo

4079
02:39:53,000 --> 02:39:55,000
classic franchise

4080
02:39:55,000 --> 02:39:57,000
shirts, you know? Everybody has a...

4081
02:39:57,000 --> 02:39:59,000
Nintendo lives off nostalgia, man.

4082
02:39:59,000 --> 02:40:01,000
But that's the thing, is, like,

4083
02:40:01,000 --> 02:40:03,000
Nintendo, on the other hand, can't...

4084
02:40:03,000 --> 02:40:05,000
I know they basically are

4085
02:40:05,000 --> 02:40:07,000
marketing... They've marketed the Wii

4086
02:40:07,000 --> 02:40:09,000
as more of a casual gamer system,

4087
02:40:09,000 --> 02:40:11,000
therefore, you know,

4088
02:40:11,000 --> 02:40:13,000
setting aside

4089
02:40:13,000 --> 02:40:15,000
all the, you know, all the

4090
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:17,000
hardcores that they marketed to in the past.

4091
02:40:17,000 --> 02:40:19,000
I mean, that's pretty

4092
02:40:19,000 --> 02:40:21,000
much it. As long as you're...

4093
02:40:21,000 --> 02:40:23,000
What's happening is that they're getting

4094
02:40:23,000 --> 02:40:25,000
outgunned by other, you know,

4095
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:27,000
more easily

4096
02:40:27,000 --> 02:40:29,000
available platforms, like an iPhone

4097
02:40:29,000 --> 02:40:31,000
or an Android. Something that most

4098
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:33,000
people would have in their pocket,

4099
02:40:33,000 --> 02:40:35,000
aside from a DS.

4100
02:40:35,000 --> 02:40:37,000
And it's more than capable of running those games.

4101
02:40:39,000 --> 02:40:41,000
Alright, anything else on your mind tonight, Zaku?

4102
02:40:41,000 --> 02:40:43,000
Um, Back to the

4103
02:40:43,000 --> 02:40:45,000
Future of the Game, the first episode, is

4104
02:40:45,000 --> 02:40:47,000
pretty much free from their

4105
02:40:47,000 --> 02:40:49,000
Telltale Games site.

4106
02:40:49,000 --> 02:40:51,000
Pretty awesome so far. Yeah, you having a good time with that?

4107
02:40:51,000 --> 02:40:53,000
Although, even contrary to what the others are saying,

4108
02:40:53,000 --> 02:40:55,000
it's, like, it's getting better.

4109
02:40:55,000 --> 02:40:57,000
Like, I'm hearing the third episode's actually the best

4110
02:40:57,000 --> 02:40:59,000
so far. I'm really excited

4111
02:40:59,000 --> 02:41:01,000
for their Jurassic Park game. I don't know

4112
02:41:01,000 --> 02:41:03,000
what it is, but, like, you know, they had a new trailer

4113
02:41:03,000 --> 02:41:05,000
come in. It's like an adventure game where you just, like, click

4114
02:41:05,000 --> 02:41:07,000
around to solve puzzles

4115
02:41:07,000 --> 02:41:09,000
based on the storyline of the Back

4116
02:41:09,000 --> 02:41:11,000
to the Future.

4117
02:41:11,000 --> 02:41:13,000
And the guy who basically does

4118
02:41:13,000 --> 02:41:15,000
Marty's voice is very close.

4119
02:41:15,000 --> 02:41:17,000
Does almost a

4120
02:41:17,000 --> 02:41:19,000
spot-on impression of Michael J. Fox.

4121
02:41:19,000 --> 02:41:21,000
Nice. You have to actually listen to it, though.

4122
02:41:21,000 --> 02:41:23,000
I do. I really need to play the Back

4123
02:41:23,000 --> 02:41:25,000
to the Future. I forgot that it was

4124
02:41:25,000 --> 02:41:27,000
the free, you know,

4125
02:41:27,000 --> 02:41:29,000
time for it now that it's out. Because I remember

4126
02:41:29,000 --> 02:41:31,000
the whole stories about the, you know, code

4127
02:41:31,000 --> 02:41:33,000
word being in the Blu-ray and everything. So that's cool

4128
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:35,000
that it's out there for free now. So I'll definitely have to check that out.

4129
02:41:35,000 --> 02:41:37,000
The first episode's out for free. Right.

4130
02:41:37,000 --> 02:41:39,000
They're gonna get you on the other ones, though.

4131
02:41:39,000 --> 02:41:41,000
Yeah. Alright. Well, Zaku,

4132
02:41:41,000 --> 02:41:43,000
take care, buddy. We'll see you next time.

4133
02:41:43,000 --> 02:41:45,000
Alright, bye.

4134
02:41:45,000 --> 02:41:47,000
1877 Game OLR.

4135
02:41:47,000 --> 02:41:49,000
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

4136
02:41:49,000 --> 02:41:51,000
Was that it?

4137
02:41:51,000 --> 02:41:53,000
You don't have any other stories for us, Loki?

4138
02:41:53,000 --> 02:41:55,000
Uh, well, that was the only

4139
02:41:55,000 --> 02:41:57,000
new one right now. Let me dig up

4140
02:41:57,000 --> 02:41:59,000
some other stuff here real quick.

4141
02:41:59,000 --> 02:42:01,000
Because, I don't know, it was kind of annoying

4142
02:42:01,000 --> 02:42:03,000
that, uh, I think

4143
02:42:03,000 --> 02:42:05,000
Oh, and the other thing, too,

4144
02:42:05,000 --> 02:42:07,000
that should be noted with that is they're basically

4145
02:42:07,000 --> 02:42:09,000
saying contradictory things

4146
02:42:09,000 --> 02:42:11,000
in both cases, and they're on record saying

4147
02:42:11,000 --> 02:42:13,000
contradictory things in both cases, so

4148
02:42:13,000 --> 02:42:15,000
they're lying somewhere.

4149
02:42:15,000 --> 02:42:17,000
Like, they're saying, oh,

4150
02:42:17,000 --> 02:42:19,000
well, this other OS stuff, that's all

4151
02:42:19,000 --> 02:42:21,000
Sony, Japan's, you know, doing.

4152
02:42:21,000 --> 02:42:23,000
They're behind it. And then

4153
02:42:23,000 --> 02:42:25,000
in the GeoHats case,

4154
02:42:25,000 --> 02:42:27,000
or the GeorgeHats case, they're like,

4155
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:29,000
oh, that's Sony America. They're behind it.

4156
02:42:29,000 --> 02:42:31,000
Which is it, Sony?

4157
02:42:31,000 --> 02:42:33,000
You're on record saying both, so

4158
02:42:33,000 --> 02:42:35,000
you've perjured yourself one way or another.

4159
02:42:37,000 --> 02:42:39,000
Alright. We're gonna try this call

4160
02:42:39,000 --> 02:42:41,000
again, see if it's better. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

4161
02:42:41,000 --> 02:42:43,000
It's Ranma. Can you hear me better

4162
02:42:43,000 --> 02:42:45,000
now? Yes, and you're not giving that horrible

4163
02:42:45,000 --> 02:42:47,000
feedback. I don't know what that was about.

4164
02:42:47,000 --> 02:42:49,000
I think it's something with my computer.

4165
02:42:49,000 --> 02:42:51,000
I think it's long overdue for a fresh Windows

4166
02:42:51,000 --> 02:42:53,000
installation. Maybe Sony is trying to get

4167
02:42:53,000 --> 02:42:55,000
inside your computer and see what you're really doing with it.

4168
02:42:55,000 --> 02:42:57,000
Either that, maybe because Logitech

4169
02:42:57,000 --> 02:42:59,000
is pissed because I dumped their headset

4170
02:42:59,000 --> 02:43:01,000
for a better Microsoft one. SonyCat

4171
02:43:01,000 --> 02:43:03,000
is watching you masturbate.

4172
02:43:03,000 --> 02:43:05,000
I could give two shits about that. Alright.

4173
02:43:05,000 --> 02:43:07,000
What's on your mind tonight?

4174
02:43:07,000 --> 02:43:09,000
Something a little bit different,

4175
02:43:09,000 --> 02:43:11,000
as, if you remember what we talked about

4176
02:43:11,000 --> 02:43:13,000
in PM last week,

4177
02:43:13,000 --> 02:43:15,000
I upgraded my phone.

4178
02:43:15,000 --> 02:43:17,000
I now have an Android phone, and

4179
02:43:17,000 --> 02:43:19,000
I'm doing something I thought

4180
02:43:19,000 --> 02:43:21,000
I'd never find myself doing. What's that?

4181
02:43:21,000 --> 02:43:23,000
Mobile gaming.

4182
02:43:23,000 --> 02:43:25,000
Oh my gosh, alright.

4183
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:27,000
Took the plunge and did some mobile gaming.

4184
02:43:27,000 --> 02:43:29,000
Now, do you have a phone that has actual

4185
02:43:29,000 --> 02:43:31,000
tangible controls, or is it an

4186
02:43:31,000 --> 02:43:33,000
all-touchscreen phone, like the iPhone?

4187
02:43:33,000 --> 02:43:35,000
Both. I have the

4188
02:43:35,000 --> 02:43:37,000
Samsung Epic 4G. Touchscreen,

4189
02:43:37,000 --> 02:43:39,000
if I slide it out, I have keyboard

4190
02:43:39,000 --> 02:43:41,000
access. Nice.

4191
02:43:41,000 --> 02:43:43,000
But so far, the games I've played

4192
02:43:43,000 --> 02:43:45,000
is completely in total touchscreen, which is not

4193
02:43:45,000 --> 02:43:47,000
so bad, even with the

4194
02:43:47,000 --> 02:43:49,000
screen protector on it.

4195
02:43:49,000 --> 02:43:51,000
Well, what kind of games have you been playing? Tell us about

4196
02:43:51,000 --> 02:43:53,000
some of the better ones.

4197
02:43:53,000 --> 02:43:55,000
Well, you can probably assume I have

4198
02:43:55,000 --> 02:43:57,000
that game everyone has been talking about,

4199
02:43:57,000 --> 02:43:59,000
Angry Birds. Of course.

4200
02:43:59,000 --> 02:44:01,000
I'm playing it, and I'm like, I can see

4201
02:44:01,000 --> 02:44:03,000
why people are into it. It's like

4202
02:44:03,000 --> 02:44:05,000
the new version of Worms

4203
02:44:05,000 --> 02:44:07,000
or something like that, you know?

4204
02:44:07,000 --> 02:44:09,000
And as

4205
02:44:09,000 --> 02:44:11,000
I was going through the marketplace,

4206
02:44:11,000 --> 02:44:13,000
I came across this one game that was probably

4207
02:44:13,000 --> 02:44:15,000
you probably tickled pink over the name of it.

4208
02:44:15,000 --> 02:44:17,000
Uh oh. It's called

4209
02:44:17,000 --> 02:44:19,000
Pew Pew. Pew Pew!

4210
02:44:19,000 --> 02:44:21,000
What is it?

4211
02:44:21,000 --> 02:44:23,000
It has involved kittens with lasers?

4212
02:44:23,000 --> 02:44:25,000
No, it's

4213
02:44:25,000 --> 02:44:27,000
pretty much Geometry Wars.

4214
02:44:27,000 --> 02:44:29,000
Oh, that's kinda cool. On Android.

4215
02:44:29,000 --> 02:44:31,000
That's cool. And it has

4216
02:44:31,000 --> 02:44:33,000
a couple of controllers on there

4217
02:44:33,000 --> 02:44:35,000
so you can control and play, and I've been

4218
02:44:35,000 --> 02:44:37,000
playing it, and the controlling is not so bad

4219
02:44:37,000 --> 02:44:39,000
on it, and

4220
02:44:39,000 --> 02:44:41,000
see, I picked up another game

4221
02:44:41,000 --> 02:44:43,000
that I got from Joe of Data called

4222
02:44:43,000 --> 02:44:45,000
Unfurry. That's like a block puzzle

4223
02:44:45,000 --> 02:44:47,000
game, but it's pretty good.

4224
02:44:47,000 --> 02:44:49,000
And as I'm going through the marketplace,

4225
02:44:49,000 --> 02:44:51,000
I can understand why

4226
02:44:51,000 --> 02:44:53,000
Nintendo said what they said.

4227
02:44:53,000 --> 02:44:55,000
I think the GDC about these

4228
02:44:55,000 --> 02:44:57,000
games on the 3DS,

4229
02:44:57,000 --> 02:44:59,000
because I looked at them like,

4230
02:44:59,000 --> 02:45:01,000
yeah, a lot of these games are total

4231
02:45:01,000 --> 02:45:03,000
and utter crap. Call me crazy.

4232
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:05,000
If I'm dropping $250

4233
02:45:05,000 --> 02:45:07,000
on a gaming comp, I'd like

4234
02:45:07,000 --> 02:45:09,000
some quality games, you know?

4235
02:45:09,000 --> 02:45:11,000
Right.

4236
02:45:11,000 --> 02:45:13,000
You just don't want a bunch of free stuff

4237
02:45:13,000 --> 02:45:15,000
that sucks.

4238
02:45:15,000 --> 02:45:17,000
That's pretty much it. Now, if they

4239
02:45:17,000 --> 02:45:19,000
do something along the lines of

4240
02:45:19,000 --> 02:45:21,000
if a bunch of independent

4241
02:45:21,000 --> 02:45:23,000
developers put together a bunch of these

4242
02:45:23,000 --> 02:45:25,000
minigames together, and put together

4243
02:45:25,000 --> 02:45:27,000
some type of collection

4244
02:45:27,000 --> 02:45:29,000
for like $20 or something like that,

4245
02:45:29,000 --> 02:45:31,000
that probably wouldn't be so bad.

4246
02:45:31,000 --> 02:45:33,000
You know, funny enough, there's something like that on Steam, or at least

4247
02:45:33,000 --> 02:45:35,000
there was. It was either April Fool's Day or the day after.

4248
02:45:35,000 --> 02:45:37,000
There was like 13 independent games

4249
02:45:37,000 --> 02:45:39,000
going for like maybe $29

4250
02:45:39,000 --> 02:45:41,000
or $39, and one of them

4251
02:45:41,000 --> 02:45:43,000
was like Super Meat Boy. There was some big titles

4252
02:45:43,000 --> 02:45:45,000
in there. VVV, which I think Act F's

4253
02:45:45,000 --> 02:45:47,000
called in about before it was in there.

4254
02:45:47,000 --> 02:45:49,000
Yeah, I remember that.

4255
02:45:49,000 --> 02:45:51,000
High Profile Indie Games was in this big pack

4256
02:45:51,000 --> 02:45:53,000
lately, so sometimes the indie games will

4257
02:45:53,000 --> 02:45:55,000
band together for big sales like that.

4258
02:45:55,000 --> 02:45:57,000
Definitely.

4259
02:45:57,000 --> 02:45:59,000
And I started to notice that,

4260
02:45:59,000 --> 02:46:01,000
yeah, I'm playing around with

4261
02:46:01,000 --> 02:46:03,000
these games more than my

4262
02:46:03,000 --> 02:46:05,000
DS, because my phone is right there.

4263
02:46:05,000 --> 02:46:07,000
Pull it out, hit the button, the game

4264
02:46:07,000 --> 02:46:09,000
starts. Whereas I gotta pull it out of my

4265
02:46:09,000 --> 02:46:11,000
bag, fire it up, pick the game,

4266
02:46:11,000 --> 02:46:13,000
and start it up, you know? I guess it's like

4267
02:46:13,000 --> 02:46:15,000
convenience. It's a portable system where you don't have

4268
02:46:15,000 --> 02:46:17,000
to think about grabbing the system. You just, you always

4269
02:46:17,000 --> 02:46:19,000
have it on you.

4270
02:46:19,000 --> 02:46:21,000
And definitely, yes.

4271
02:46:21,000 --> 02:46:23,000
There you go. Well, congratulations

4272
02:46:23,000 --> 02:46:25,000
on jumping into mobile gaming.

4273
02:46:25,000 --> 02:46:27,000
Anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?

4274
02:46:27,000 --> 02:46:29,000
Yeah, something that I think

4275
02:46:29,000 --> 02:46:31,000
Jamie would greatly appreciate.

4276
02:46:31,000 --> 02:46:33,000
What is that?

4277
02:46:33,000 --> 02:46:35,000
DDR Dollar Bill went to Megacon, and he

4278
02:46:35,000 --> 02:46:37,000
got me this shirt. It says

4279
02:46:37,000 --> 02:46:39,000
on the back,

4280
02:46:39,000 --> 02:46:41,000
KOKRK,

4281
02:46:41,000 --> 02:46:43,000
King of Kong, Orlando, Florida.

4282
02:46:43,000 --> 02:46:45,000
And on the front it says,

4283
02:46:45,000 --> 02:46:47,000
Never Surrender, Never,

4284
02:46:47,000 --> 02:46:49,000
Billy Mitchell.

4285
02:46:49,000 --> 02:46:51,000
And I just noticed

4286
02:46:51,000 --> 02:46:53,000
that it's a limited

4287
02:46:53,000 --> 02:46:55,000
edition shirt with his signature.

4288
02:46:55,000 --> 02:46:57,000
It says, Billy Mitchell

4289
02:46:57,000 --> 02:46:59,000
Video Game Player of the Century.

4290
02:46:59,000 --> 02:47:01,000
How about Jerkface

4291
02:47:01,000 --> 02:47:03,000
of the Century? I like that

4292
02:47:03,000 --> 02:47:05,000
even better.

4293
02:47:05,000 --> 02:47:07,000
Aw, I'm sure he's a nice guy.

4294
02:47:07,000 --> 02:47:09,000
No, he's not actually.

4295
02:47:09,000 --> 02:47:11,000
He's a big jerk.

4296
02:47:11,000 --> 02:47:13,000
No, I've never talked to the guy.

4297
02:47:13,000 --> 02:47:15,000
But he apparently sells really good barbecue sauce?

4298
02:47:15,000 --> 02:47:17,000
Hey.

4299
02:47:17,000 --> 02:47:19,000
That works. Let me be the judge of that, because I love

4300
02:47:19,000 --> 02:47:21,000
my barbecue sauce. Me too.

4301
02:47:21,000 --> 02:47:23,000
Alright, Rama, we're gonna let you go, try to fit in one more

4302
02:47:23,000 --> 02:47:25,000
call before we end the Skype tonight, so take care, buddy.

4303
02:47:25,000 --> 02:47:27,000
Wonderful. Bye.

4304
02:47:27,000 --> 02:47:29,000
Alright.

4305
02:47:29,000 --> 02:47:31,000
Let's see if we can take one more call

4306
02:47:31,000 --> 02:47:33,000
on the Skype line. 1-877-GAME-OLR

4307
02:47:33,000 --> 02:47:35,000
or our username on Skype is

4308
02:47:35,000 --> 02:47:37,000
OrangeLoungeRadio. Any other

4309
02:47:37,000 --> 02:47:39,000
stories?

4310
02:47:39,000 --> 02:47:41,000
Yeah, there's a new game, I don't know if you've

4311
02:47:41,000 --> 02:47:43,000
ever played the game QWOP.

4312
02:47:43,000 --> 02:47:45,000
Remember QWOP?

4313
02:47:45,000 --> 02:47:47,000
I have not played QWOP. I've played a lot of crap.

4314
02:47:47,000 --> 02:47:49,000
I have.

4315
02:47:49,000 --> 02:47:51,000
Anyways, there's a new game called

4316
02:47:51,000 --> 02:47:53,000
GURP, and it's a rock climbing game

4317
02:47:53,000 --> 02:47:55,000
that requires you to basically

4318
02:47:55,000 --> 02:47:57,000
kind of

4319
02:47:57,000 --> 02:47:59,000
bend your fingers in

4320
02:47:59,000 --> 02:48:01,000
almost a twister type of way

4321
02:48:01,000 --> 02:48:03,000
using the shift keys, the mouse buttons,

4322
02:48:03,000 --> 02:48:05,000
or shift keys are the mouse buttons, and you have to hit

4323
02:48:05,000 --> 02:48:07,000
certain letters

4324
02:48:07,000 --> 02:48:09,000
on your keyboard in order to climb,

4325
02:48:09,000 --> 02:48:11,000
and you have to avoid this rising water.

4326
02:48:11,000 --> 02:48:13,000
And if it's anything like QWOP, it's really

4327
02:48:13,000 --> 02:48:15,000
damn hard. Impossible, yeah.

4328
02:48:15,000 --> 02:48:17,000
Alright, let's take one more

4329
02:48:17,000 --> 02:48:19,000
call here on the Skype line before we call tonight.

4330
02:48:19,000 --> 02:48:21,000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

4331
02:48:21,000 --> 02:48:23,000
This is DT.

4332
02:48:23,000 --> 02:48:25,000
Hey, DarkTets Studio, what's up, buddy?

4333
02:48:25,000 --> 02:48:27,000
Oh, I

4334
02:48:27,000 --> 02:48:29,000
think you can probably guess. I know, I was gonna

4335
02:48:29,000 --> 02:48:31,000
say, this has got to be about

4336
02:48:31,000 --> 02:48:33,000
WonderCon. I know you were really excited

4337
02:48:33,000 --> 02:48:35,000
about your trip out to WonderCon, which happened this week.

4338
02:48:35,000 --> 02:48:37,000
Tell us about some of the games you saw at

4339
02:48:37,000 --> 02:48:39,000
WonderCon.

4340
02:48:39,000 --> 02:48:41,000
Oh, man. Well, Nintendo

4341
02:48:41,000 --> 02:48:43,000
had a huge boost, and they were showing off

4342
02:48:43,000 --> 02:48:45,000
all of the 3DS games they had

4343
02:48:45,000 --> 02:48:47,000
that.

4344
02:48:47,000 --> 02:48:49,000
Did anything

4345
02:48:49,000 --> 02:48:51,000
catch your eyes

4346
02:48:51,000 --> 02:48:53,000
over there? It was pretty cool?

4347
02:48:53,000 --> 02:48:55,000
Well, I like

4348
02:48:55,000 --> 02:48:57,000
that a little bit. Steel Diver.

4349
02:48:57,000 --> 02:48:59,000
Uh-huh.

4350
02:48:59,000 --> 02:49:01,000
It was pretty cool. Was that the first time you ever got to

4351
02:49:01,000 --> 02:49:03,000
touch 3- was that the first time you ever got to get your hands on

4352
02:49:03,000 --> 02:49:05,000
a 3DS? Yeah. What'd you think about

4353
02:49:05,000 --> 02:49:07,000
3D? What'd you think about it when you, like, first

4354
02:49:07,000 --> 02:49:09,000
saw it?

4355
02:49:09,000 --> 02:49:11,000
Oh, yeah, it was pretty neat. Yeah, did you

4356
02:49:11,000 --> 02:49:13,000
do that whole thing, like, cause I know I do

4357
02:49:13,000 --> 02:49:15,000
this the first time. Like, you know, you

4358
02:49:15,000 --> 02:49:17,000
know you're about to play a system that's 3D with

4359
02:49:17,000 --> 02:49:19,000
no glasses, but then you, like, you know, you're kinda

4360
02:49:19,000 --> 02:49:21,000
like, you have that little bit of a doubt where you're like,

4361
02:49:21,000 --> 02:49:23,000
oh, this is gonna be stupid. And then, like, you

4362
02:49:23,000 --> 02:49:25,000
pick it up and you're like, whoa, you kinda have

4363
02:49:25,000 --> 02:49:27,000
that moment of, whoa, it really is 3D.

4364
02:49:27,000 --> 02:49:29,000
Oh, yeah.

4365
02:49:29,000 --> 02:49:31,000
Yeah, so.

4366
02:49:31,000 --> 02:49:33,000
Batman also had, uh, Kate

4367
02:49:33,000 --> 02:49:35,000
Icarus demo. Oh, did they?

4368
02:49:35,000 --> 02:49:37,000
Nice. Was it playable

4369
02:49:37,000 --> 02:49:39,000
or was it just, like, a trailer?

4370
02:49:39,000 --> 02:49:41,000
Yeah, no, it was playable. Oh,

4371
02:49:41,000 --> 02:49:43,000
shit, nice. I felt like, uh, unless you ever played

4372
02:49:43,000 --> 02:49:45,000
Sin and Punishment. Uh-huh.

4373
02:49:45,000 --> 02:49:47,000
Yeah, it kinda

4374
02:49:47,000 --> 02:49:49,000
felt like that. Nice. By the way,

4375
02:49:49,000 --> 02:49:51,000
Sin and Punishment was- Lion with the analog stick

4376
02:49:51,000 --> 02:49:53,000
and the name was the- Sin

4377
02:49:53,000 --> 02:49:55,000
and Punishment was another one of those games that

4378
02:49:55,000 --> 02:49:57,000
Fry's, that they had, like, 20 extra copies of

4379
02:49:57,000 --> 02:49:59,000
that they were trying to get rid of. The, uh, new

4380
02:49:59,000 --> 02:50:01,000
one that was out on the Wii. Mm.

4381
02:50:01,000 --> 02:50:03,000
It's unfortunate. Anyway, sorry about that,

4382
02:50:03,000 --> 02:50:05,000
DT. Yeah, I'm sorry.

4383
02:50:05,000 --> 02:50:07,000
But, uh, okay, well, what other,

4384
02:50:07,000 --> 02:50:09,000
what other, like, did Capcom have anything? I

4385
02:50:09,000 --> 02:50:11,000
know you always try to run over there and look at their booth.

4386
02:50:11,000 --> 02:50:13,000
Oh, yeah, well,

4387
02:50:13,000 --> 02:50:15,000
most of the stuff they had, those stuff was already

4388
02:50:15,000 --> 02:50:17,000
out, but they did have Resident Evil,

4389
02:50:17,000 --> 02:50:19,000
which was, well, it's alright, I guess.

4390
02:50:19,000 --> 02:50:21,000
Oh, cool.

4391
02:50:21,000 --> 02:50:23,000
Mm-hmm.

4392
02:50:23,000 --> 02:50:25,000
Um, what else?

4393
02:50:25,000 --> 02:50:27,000
Any other games?

4394
02:50:27,000 --> 02:50:29,000
Uh, let's

4395
02:50:29,000 --> 02:50:31,000
see, they had the, all the

4396
02:50:31,000 --> 02:50:33,000
big movie, comic book movie games,

4397
02:50:33,000 --> 02:50:35,000
like Thor and Captain America and

4398
02:50:35,000 --> 02:50:37,000
Green Lantern. Oh, yeah, god,

4399
02:50:37,000 --> 02:50:39,000
there's gonna be a ton of those this summer with all the

4400
02:50:39,000 --> 02:50:41,000
comic book movies coming out. Oh, yeah, we have Thor,

4401
02:50:41,000 --> 02:50:43,000
Green Lantern, there's an X-Men movie

4402
02:50:43,000 --> 02:50:45,000
as well, right, the first class? It's crap.

4403
02:50:45,000 --> 02:50:47,000
I know, I so don't wanna see it, I don't care.

4404
02:50:47,000 --> 02:50:49,000
Uh, what else is there?

4405
02:50:49,000 --> 02:50:51,000
I think there's, um,

4406
02:50:51,000 --> 02:50:53,000
I feel like I'm missing some huge ones.

4407
02:50:53,000 --> 02:50:55,000
Oh, well, whatever.

4408
02:50:55,000 --> 02:50:57,000
What, huge? Comic book movies.

4409
02:50:57,000 --> 02:50:59,000
Comic book movies. There's Thor,

4410
02:50:59,000 --> 02:51:01,000
there's Captain America, Green Lantern,

4411
02:51:01,000 --> 02:51:03,000
Green Lantern, there's the big three.

4412
02:51:03,000 --> 02:51:05,000
There's X-Men First Class,

4413
02:51:05,000 --> 02:51:07,000
there's the Spider-Man reboot this year, or is that next year?

4414
02:51:07,000 --> 02:51:09,000
No, that's not for a while.

4415
02:51:09,000 --> 02:51:11,000
And, um,

4416
02:51:11,000 --> 02:51:13,000
but they're also, I think, gonna

4417
02:51:13,000 --> 02:51:15,000
be rebooting Fantastic Four,

4418
02:51:15,000 --> 02:51:17,000
Transformers, if you wanna count that as, uh,

4419
02:51:17,000 --> 02:51:19,000
another Superman,

4420
02:51:19,000 --> 02:51:21,000
and, uh, Batman.

4421
02:51:21,000 --> 02:51:23,000
Oh, yeah, Batman 3 is next year, and that I'm

4422
02:51:23,000 --> 02:51:25,000
excited about, but I don't know how the game would be.

4423
02:51:25,000 --> 02:51:27,000
Well, I did see your write-up,

4424
02:51:27,000 --> 02:51:29,000
uh, is available over at OrangeLoungeRadio.com,

4425
02:51:29,000 --> 02:51:31,000
so it looks like you kept a little dear diary

4426
02:51:31,000 --> 02:51:33,000
while you were there, and saw stuff.

4427
02:51:33,000 --> 02:51:35,000
Now, I have to ask, did you get to see the masquerade at all?

4428
02:51:35,000 --> 02:51:37,000
Uh,

4429
02:51:37,000 --> 02:51:39,000
a little bit, it's a bunch of costumes

4430
02:51:39,000 --> 02:51:41,000
all over. Did you see,

4431
02:51:41,000 --> 02:51:43,000
by chance, the, um,

4432
02:51:43,000 --> 02:51:45,000
Main Street Electronica Parade?

4433
02:51:45,000 --> 02:51:47,000
Oh, no,

4434
02:51:47,000 --> 02:51:49,000
I didn't see that.

4435
02:51:49,000 --> 02:51:51,000
One of my friends was in that, and that, uh,

4436
02:51:51,000 --> 02:51:53,000
she's been on the show before, Victoria, I think,

4437
02:51:53,000 --> 02:51:55,000
filled in one week when Jamie wasn't here.

4438
02:51:55,000 --> 02:51:57,000
She was one of the gals in the, it was a, uh,

4439
02:51:57,000 --> 02:51:59,000
they did the Main Street Electrical Parade, but with

4440
02:51:59,000 --> 02:52:01,000
a Tron theme, like the Tron guy was stuck

4441
02:52:01,000 --> 02:52:03,000
in the Main Street Electric Parade.

4442
02:52:03,000 --> 02:52:05,000
Yeah, it was pretty awesome.

4443
02:52:05,000 --> 02:52:07,000
They didn't win! They were robbed!

4444
02:52:07,000 --> 02:52:09,000
Of course, I didn't see the winning video, but I'm extremely

4445
02:52:09,000 --> 02:52:11,000
biased. Extremely biased.

4446
02:52:11,000 --> 02:52:13,000
So, alright, well, DT, I'm glad you had fun

4447
02:52:13,000 --> 02:52:15,000
at the show. You know, we will actually have to go

4448
02:52:15,000 --> 02:52:17,000
some year. This was just really not a good year

4449
02:52:17,000 --> 02:52:19,000
for me to go, but I am hoping we will go

4450
02:52:19,000 --> 02:52:21,000
to Find Me this year. That is

4451
02:52:21,000 --> 02:52:23,000
something we're trying to do, so we'll see. Alright.

4452
02:52:23,000 --> 02:52:25,000
Oh, we're gonna go back next year, so.

4453
02:52:25,000 --> 02:52:27,000
Awesome. Well, we'll try to make it next year.

4454
02:52:27,000 --> 02:52:29,000
Alright. Alright. Take care and check out

4455
02:52:29,000 --> 02:52:31,000
that article at orangelawnsready.com by DT.

4456
02:52:31,000 --> 02:52:33,000
Alright, bye guys!

4457
02:52:33,000 --> 02:52:35,000
Yep.

4458
02:52:35,000 --> 02:52:37,000
I don't know why I said guys. I was saying bye to you guys.

4459
02:52:37,000 --> 02:52:39,000
Bye to you guys. I'm gonna go read that article. Alright.

4460
02:52:39,000 --> 02:52:41,000
No, it is about time to say bye, guys.

4461
02:52:41,000 --> 02:52:43,000
The show's about over.

4462
02:52:43,000 --> 02:52:45,000
Thanks, you guys, though, for tuning in to us. We're gonna

4463
02:52:45,000 --> 02:52:47,000
close up the Skype line. If you didn't get through tonight,

4464
02:52:47,000 --> 02:52:49,000
sorry. Try sending us an

4465
02:52:49,000 --> 02:52:51,000
email next time. Mailbag

4466
02:52:51,000 --> 02:52:53,000
at orangelawnsready.com is the place where you

4467
02:52:53,000 --> 02:52:55,000
can send us an email.

4468
02:52:55,000 --> 02:52:57,000
Let me ask Loki one more time if there's any last minute

4469
02:52:57,000 --> 02:52:59,000
stories before we wrap it all up. Yeah, there's

4470
02:52:59,000 --> 02:53:01,000
a leaked Forza 4 pitch

4471
02:53:01,000 --> 02:53:03,000
video that was supposed to be, I think, part of their

4472
02:53:03,000 --> 02:53:05,000
E3 presentation, and

4473
02:53:05,000 --> 02:53:07,000
basically confirmed everything that

4474
02:53:07,000 --> 02:53:09,000
was already leaked out regarding

4475
02:53:09,000 --> 02:53:11,000
Forza 4, including the head tracking,

4476
02:53:11,000 --> 02:53:13,000
the Kinect

4477
02:53:13,000 --> 02:53:15,000
integration, that kind of stuff.

4478
02:53:15,000 --> 02:53:17,000
Good stuff.

4479
02:53:17,000 --> 02:53:19,000
Head tracking, pretty awesome. They were saying, yes, you'll

4480
02:53:19,000 --> 02:53:21,000
be able to use head tracking to look into the corners

4481
02:53:21,000 --> 02:53:23,000
when you're driving and stuff. Although, that's a little

4482
02:53:23,000 --> 02:53:25,000
awkward for me.

4483
02:53:25,000 --> 02:53:27,000
I think because if your TV's in front of you,

4484
02:53:27,000 --> 02:53:29,000
you can't really turn your head to the side.

4485
02:53:29,000 --> 02:53:31,000
It's gonna be a little weird, yeah.

4486
02:53:31,000 --> 02:53:33,000
It'd be cool if the multiple

4487
02:53:33,000 --> 02:53:35,000
monitors support or whatever, but

4488
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:37,000
once again, why would you need

4489
02:53:37,000 --> 02:53:39,000
head tracking if you have multiple monitors?

4490
02:53:39,000 --> 02:53:41,000
But hey,

4491
02:53:41,000 --> 02:53:43,000
glad to see they're using head tracking,

4492
02:53:43,000 --> 02:53:45,000
so that'll be awesome.

4493
02:53:45,000 --> 02:53:47,000
Alright, very cool.

4494
02:53:47,000 --> 02:53:49,000
This might be a little hint of what is to come

4495
02:53:49,000 --> 02:53:51,000
for the next generation of Kinect, and this could be very,

4496
02:53:51,000 --> 02:53:53,000
very good. Yeah. So we'll see.

4497
02:53:53,000 --> 02:53:55,000
Alright, well it's that time of the show where we go around

4498
02:53:55,000 --> 02:53:57,000
and get everybody's final thought as we wrap

4499
02:53:57,000 --> 02:53:59,000
up another week here at Orange Lounge Radio.

4500
02:53:59,000 --> 02:54:01,000
SalaciousPop, thanks again for being here.

4501
02:54:01,000 --> 02:54:03,000
You did a lot of talking this week. I'm very proud of you.

4502
02:54:03,000 --> 02:54:05,000
Alright, so thanks, and do you have

4503
02:54:05,000 --> 02:54:07,000
any final thoughts for our listeners?

4504
02:54:11,000 --> 02:54:13,000
No.

4505
02:54:13,000 --> 02:54:15,000
Alright then, alright.

4506
02:54:15,000 --> 02:54:17,000
Let's see, Dark Soccer, I guess I'll go to you next.

4507
02:54:17,000 --> 02:54:19,000
Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

4508
02:54:19,000 --> 02:54:21,000
I want more pinkberry.

4509
02:54:21,000 --> 02:54:23,000
And my final thought along

4510
02:54:23,000 --> 02:54:25,000
those lines is that the Lychee

4511
02:54:25,000 --> 02:54:27,000
pinkberry can go to hell.

4512
02:54:27,000 --> 02:54:29,000
Blood orange forever. It's not gross.

4513
02:54:29,000 --> 02:54:31,000
It's good. It's not blood orange.

4514
02:54:31,000 --> 02:54:33,000
But the mango is amazing.

4515
02:54:33,000 --> 02:54:35,000
Eh, whatever. It's not blood orange.

4516
02:54:35,000 --> 02:54:37,000
Alright, Loki, your final thoughts tonight?

4517
02:54:37,000 --> 02:54:39,000
Um...

4518
02:54:39,000 --> 02:54:41,000
I don't know.

4519
02:54:41,000 --> 02:54:43,000
I'm down to

4520
02:54:43,000 --> 02:54:45,000
my US 3DS system.

4521
02:54:45,000 --> 02:54:47,000
I got rid of all the rest.

4522
02:54:47,000 --> 02:54:49,000
Aww.

4523
02:54:49,000 --> 02:54:51,000
Aww, that's great.

4524
02:54:51,000 --> 02:54:53,000
Did the wife catch you?

4525
02:54:53,000 --> 02:54:55,000
No.

4526
02:54:55,000 --> 02:54:57,000
He was like, why would she?

4527
02:54:57,000 --> 02:54:59,000
And then you're gonna come home,

4528
02:54:59,000 --> 02:55:01,000
and be like, what?

4529
02:55:01,000 --> 02:55:03,000
No, she doesn't listen to the show.

4530
02:55:03,000 --> 02:55:05,000
I was talking to her last week.

4531
02:55:05,000 --> 02:55:07,000
She listened for just a minute.

4532
02:55:07,000 --> 02:55:09,000
It was like...

4533
02:55:09,000 --> 02:55:11,000
Just long enough for a baby to hear daddy.

4534
02:55:11,000 --> 02:55:13,000
Pretty much, yeah.

4535
02:55:13,000 --> 02:55:15,000
She's trying to get him

4536
02:55:15,000 --> 02:55:17,000
for two naps tonight.

4537
02:55:17,000 --> 02:55:19,000
Last night he woke up

4538
02:55:19,000 --> 02:55:21,000
with me, I woke up with him at five.

4539
02:55:21,000 --> 02:55:23,000
I usually wake up with him at five in the morning.

4540
02:55:23,000 --> 02:55:25,000
Every day.

4541
02:55:25,000 --> 02:55:27,000
On the weekends even.

4542
02:55:27,000 --> 02:55:29,000
And so he wouldn't go

4543
02:55:29,000 --> 02:55:31,000
back down to bed for like about an hour.

4544
02:55:31,000 --> 02:55:33,000
He was just trying to get him to go back down.

4545
02:55:33,000 --> 02:55:35,000
And he finally slept till

4546
02:55:35,000 --> 02:55:37,000
seven forty, but...

4547
02:55:37,000 --> 02:55:39,000
I'm actually now able to be

4548
02:55:39,000 --> 02:55:41,000
wide awake at five in the morning.

4549
02:55:41,000 --> 02:55:43,000
Which works out, because I can work on my PC sometimes.

4550
02:55:43,000 --> 02:55:45,000
You know, and able to work on

4551
02:55:45,000 --> 02:55:47,000
Grand Theft Auto map edits and stuff like that

4552
02:55:47,000 --> 02:55:49,000
really in the morning without being interrupted.

4553
02:55:49,000 --> 02:55:51,000
But, uh...

4554
02:55:51,000 --> 02:55:53,000
It's tough.

4555
02:55:53,000 --> 02:55:55,000
I have to take naps now on the weekends

4556
02:55:55,000 --> 02:55:57,000
sometimes, because

4557
02:55:57,000 --> 02:55:59,000
there's only so many days you can wake up that early

4558
02:55:59,000 --> 02:56:01,000
and not be affected by it.

4559
02:56:01,000 --> 02:56:03,000
Well, Rob naps every day and he doesn't even have a kid.

4560
02:56:03,000 --> 02:56:05,000
So, don't feel too bad.

4561
02:56:05,000 --> 02:56:07,000
Hey, you've earned those naps.

4562
02:56:07,000 --> 02:56:09,000
Ring ring, hi pot, it's kettle on the phone.

4563
02:56:09,000 --> 02:56:11,000
I wanted to say,

4564
02:56:11,000 --> 02:56:13,000
and I know they're not listening obviously,

4565
02:56:13,000 --> 02:56:15,000
and I don't think they listen normally,

4566
02:56:15,000 --> 02:56:17,000
but congratulations to our friends

4567
02:56:17,000 --> 02:56:19,000
Eric and Mel for their brand new baby girl.

4568
02:56:19,000 --> 02:56:21,000
Cute baby!

4569
02:56:21,000 --> 02:56:23,000
Someone finally had a girl.

4570
02:56:23,000 --> 02:56:25,000
I know, it's like a big sausage fest,

4571
02:56:25,000 --> 02:56:27,000
but finally

4572
02:56:27,000 --> 02:56:29,000
finally getting some girls in here.

4573
02:56:29,000 --> 02:56:31,000
Alright.

4574
02:56:31,000 --> 02:56:33,000
Alright, well that does it for another week

4575
02:56:33,000 --> 02:56:35,000
here at Orange Lounge Radio.

4576
02:56:35,000 --> 02:56:37,000
Thank you guys so much for tuning in and supporting independent radio.

4577
02:56:37,000 --> 02:56:39,000
You know, all we ask if you like our show,

4578
02:56:39,000 --> 02:56:41,000
help us spread the word. We don't have big budget

4579
02:56:41,000 --> 02:56:43,000
advertising dollars. Say something nice about us

4580
02:56:43,000 --> 02:56:45,000
on a forum. Tell your friends about the show.

4581
02:56:45,000 --> 02:56:47,000
Leave us a nice review on iTunes. Anything you can do to help

4582
02:56:47,000 --> 02:56:49,000
spread the word of Orange Lounge Radio would be

4583
02:56:49,000 --> 02:56:51,000
much appreciated.

4584
02:56:51,000 --> 02:56:53,000
And next week, we'll be back to do it all again

4585
02:56:53,000 --> 02:56:55,000
one more time, episode 409.

4586
02:56:55,000 --> 02:56:57,000
I guess that means we have to do some cleaning next week

4587
02:56:57,000 --> 02:56:59,000
because it's 409. Hey, I cleaned that desk.

4588
02:56:59,000 --> 02:57:01,000
You did. It better not need cleaning next week.

4589
02:57:01,000 --> 02:57:03,000
I'll dirty it up. It isn't, it's

4590
02:57:03,000 --> 02:57:05,000
dust free, lemony fresh.

4591
02:57:05,000 --> 02:57:07,000
But shirmy tainted.

4592
02:57:07,000 --> 02:57:09,000
Well of course, duh.

4593
02:57:09,000 --> 02:57:11,000
Alright, that does it. Have a wonderful

4594
02:57:11,000 --> 02:57:13,000
week everybody. We'll see you next time here at

4595
02:57:13,000 --> 02:57:15,000

4596
02:57:15,000 --> 02:57:17,000
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

4597
02:57:17,000 --> 02:57:19,000

The views and opinions expressed

on Orange Lounge Radio do not

4606
02:57:35,000 --> 02:57:37,000
necessarily reflect those of the entire

4607

or allgames.com.

4609
02:57:41,000 --> 02:57:43,000
But we're probably right anyway.

4610
02:57:43,000 --> 02:57:55,000
See you next week.
