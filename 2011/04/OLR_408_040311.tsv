9184	24091	DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki Tonight, April 3rd, 2011, two high-profile games are outright cancelled, the 3DS breaks records in its first week, and is the Xbox Live Indie Game Store being manipulated?
31618	38421	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.
38501	42683	It is episode number 408 for this April the 3rd of 2011.

54191	54812	I'm actually full.
55373	55673	Full?
55913	56975	I made a delicious... Full of crap.
57475	57876	Uh-uh.
57996	58576	No, that's Shermie.
59477	61680	I'm... I had a delicious meal that I cooked myself.
62130	63351	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
82669	90711	So I poured the chocolate batter into a cake pan, and then put some giant chocolate chips on it, and then baked the whole thing.
91131	92051	And it tasted delicious.
92071	95032	I don't know about you guys, I'd still eat that, even though it's a cake of failure.
95132	96633	It was delicious, delicious fail.
96993	97273	Alright.
98173	101554	A host not full of fail, say hello to the one and only Techmaster Loki!

104857	108061	All right, except we are... Why are we not hearing you very well tonight?
108321	108721	I don't know.
108922	110043	Why aren't you hearing me tonight?
110504	111525	I think we're hearing you.
111545	112586	You're just really quiet.
112606	114048	I'm really quiet?
114268	114909	Yeah, you're good now.
115469	115730	Sorry.
115810	120475	I think we have to keep you kind of low because when the Nintendo topics come up, you'll get a little louder!
122397	143730	I'm not louder, I'm more opinionated You're passionate I am passionate, come on It's like, I don't know It's just stupid people doing stupid things Alright, we've got a lot of interesting news stories tonight Kind of along those lines We'll get to those in just a little bit But first, let's say hello to a guest here in studio tonight Back again this week Say hello to Salacious Pop What up?
143990	144891	How you doing, Salacious Pop?
145011	147312	Good Good, how has life been treating you lately?
147848	149129	I've been really busy.
149309	149549	Yeah?
149989	150710	What's been going on?
150770	151490	Preparing for a move.

152791	153011	Yeah.
153231	154051	You moving in with Jamie?
154131	155132	She's really lonely this week.
155232	155472	Yeah.
155492	156473	Alright.
156513	157153	It's the vault.
157253	158193	I'm just going to stay in the vault.
158514	158854	Awesome.
158894	159754	I don't even get to play anything.
159774	160635	I just get to look at stuff.
160915	161375	It's awesome.
161955	168799	Now, we missed April Fool's this year because the show's tonight's on the 3rd, but you were mentioning a really good April Fool's joke you thought we should have done.
168939	171080	Well, I can't talk about it or else I can't do it next year.
171140	172381	Oh, yeah, we gotta do it next year, I guess.
172981	174062	Okay, it's really good, y'all.
174282	183727	It was basically like OLR episode three coming, like from the vault of 1982 where the news stories are like, yeah, I'm really looking forward to that E.T.
183747	184388	game on the Atari 2600.
184648	185888	It's gonna be great.
186609	189570	The only thing about that is it's kind of close to what YouTube did.
190171	191211	So it'll be better next year.
191331	191551	Yeah.
191732	192552	Next year, y'all forget.
192792	197755	It's a little too close to Flugelhorn Feline, which, by the way, was the best April Fool's joke on the web, just so you know.
198415	225358	Alright, anyhow Well, by the way, Rob, it's not a rumor Now, see, oh Okay, before we went live tonight See, now I have to talk about all this Because you brought it up Okay, before we went live tonight Bobby was abbreviated tonight So we went live a little bit early Just kind of BSing with the live listeners And doing some music And one of the topics that came up before the show Was the Wachowski brothers And they did The Matrix And there's these rumors or something going around That one of them had a sex change
225754	226715	Larry is now Lana.
226935	232081	But now see the chat room, Tiger Klausner chat room, which by the way, hi chat room, chat.orange.com saying that's not true.
232441	233543	It's on IMDB.
233883	234103	Is it?
234684	234864	Yeah.
235164	235325	Huh?
235445	236506	Credited in IMDB.
236706	238748	I thought some producer said it wasn't true, IDK.
239990	240811	Well, I mean, you know.
241471	242332	All right, there you go.
242352	243974	If it's on IMDB, I guess it's true.
245115	245616	You know what?
247321	249363	The Matrix 2 and 3 still sucked.
250203	251184	Boy or girl directing.
251204	251444	Yes.
252485	252725	All right.
253005	254427	Let's talk about video games.
254707	256348	Of course, we do that here on the show.
256608	260812	Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com if you're listening to us live on this Sunday night at All Games Radio.
261112	266176	We do tape live at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Blackwolf show at AllGames.com.
266196	267377	So join us in our chat room.
267677	269939	To get to the chat room, chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
270139	271380	Have I plugged all the websites?
271560	272040	I believe so.
272941	278584	Twitter, OLR, Facebook, Orange Lines Radio, etc, etc Now we can talk about games Hi DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
279104	299155	I played a lot of Dragon Age 2 I borrowed it from my friend's husband Well, he's my friend too, but I borrowed his game And it's really fun And I'm kind of hooked And I played some WoW And some Final Fantasy 3 And then I looked at games at Fries with you two
300976	301956	Yes, that was it.
301996	303777	We went shopping last night and not for shoes.
304317	305237	I didn't buy anything.
305657	305917	I know.
305977	310919	It's kind of sad to go to a huge electronic stores like Fry's, which I don't think they have those everywhere.
310939	311899	I think just on the West Coast.
311939	314660	So Fry's is just like it's an Uber electronic store.
314680	315940	I think they're spread around.
316340	317700	Yeah, there might be a few in other places.
317760	319821	But yeah, it's an Uber electronic store.
319881	321561	Huge games section, huge computer section.
321581	323802	We went in there, looked around, didn't buy anything.
323922	324462	It's kind of sad.
324602	326483	Their PSP section amazed me.
327543	328944	That still exists.
329005	331847	Well, there's still a lot of good stuff coming on the PSP.
331867	332808	The UMDs.
333689	337572	Yeah, the UMDs were what impressed me, too, that they're still really supporting them.
338313	339995	$10 for most of them.
340015	341916	Because they got them really cheap, I'm sure.
341957	342717	I guess so.
342837	343218	I don't know.
343618	347561	You know, there's only one company still supporting UMD, and that's Sony.
348202	348542	Of course.
349483	351824	I don't remember the last movie.
351884	354907	I want to say 2012 was one of the last movies to come out for it.
355087	357989	Because they are kick-ass, whatever came out last year.
358561	359061	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
376997	381440	Castlevania Lords of Shadow Castlevania Lords of Shadow Castlevania Lords of Shadow
398409	400130	I hate fucking going to visit you in Fries
422424	428466	Alright, anyhow, Loki, wait, wait, I want to go back to DarkSakura and talk more about Dragon Age 2 because I haven't played the game.
428626	430526	So, you're enjoying Dragon Age 2?
431066	432667	Yes, it has Eve Miles doing a voice.
433327	435828	For anyone who does not know, she was Gwen on Torchwood.
436428	437908	Now, you didn't really play the first game, right?
438008	438188	No.
438408	439909	And you're doing okay with the second game?
440029	440549	Yeah, just fine.
440669	441829	What is it that you like so much about it?
443030	443470	Lesbians.
443890	444410	What?
446294	446634	DarkSakura.com
464764	487255	and uh but they they've already had like love chat and then there's this one guy who is hitting on my character I was like no you're gross but he was apparently from an earlier game he's the one that you give him a cat called Sir Pounce a lot I guess he was talking about his cat and then there's Isabella who's according to Tiara she's a slut she can sleep with her a bunch uh-huh
487475	488596	And then she's like, oh, it's just sex.
489877	492139	So I'm like, I haven't gotten to any fun part, though.
492179	495762	I mean, I've done a lot of... I really like this game, but it's not fun.
496202	496542	No.
496842	498043	It's kind of what I just heard.
498103	498824	It's just me.
499344	501606	I've done a lot of killing, which is great.
501886	503428	And I've got it in extra gore mode.
504468	506810	So they're covered in blood when you're done with a fight.
507471	508832	Like splattered on their face.
509953	511254	And then I was like, that's awesome.
511274	512555	Okay, gore and lesbians, got it.
513636	514817	This game really isn't fun.
514917	515978	I'm just here for the pussy.
517196	517636	and Gore.
518937	519998	It actually is really fun.
520118	523079	It's just I'm still in the first act.
523179	524980	Okay, you're like in the grind or something, right?
525821	525961	Yeah.
525981	527042	Trying to grind out that pussy.
528162	531544	Well, some elven cooch.
531684	532865	Say no more.
532945	533885	What's the battle system like?
533925	535787	It's not like a Final Fantasy RPG, right?
535867	539288	It's more like a... No, it's like you run down the stairs.
539389	540509	Oh no, there's people there.
540989	544171	And one of your party comments about how there shouldn't be people on the street after dark.
544531	545212	And then you have to kill them.
546273	570951	and there's blood everywhere and you occasionally they're like highwaymen and things and you can go outside of the town to certain areas and you'll find like piles of bones and you can dig through them for loot it's really great though I mean it's just and okay I guess this so now you're talking about touching bones in your quest for pussy my quest for pussy
572225	579450	No, it's... There's also... You know, you can go through people's stuff, and right now I'm actually trying to build up my character so I can get the lockpicking.
580211	583714	So I can open locked trunks and stuff and steal people's stuff.
584774	587857	And... What else was I doing?
589978	594560	I'm doing a lot of the side quests too so I can level up before I get to the big thing.
595080	602744	But there's somewhere else that I need to go to get some dude named Fenris who was, I think, in one of the last games.
602764	603685	No, it's going to be a three-way.
604645	605946	Well, no, I don't know.
607186	611068	Okay, Meryl is my fangirlism because I adore Eve Miles.
612109	613049	She's very cool.
613089	614470	And Welsh accents to me are hot.
615751	616191	Really hot.
618747	635349	so apparently though and I don't the elves that live outside are all Welsh the elves and humans that live in the town are all British and dwarves are American is what I'm getting so far
637017	639541	Whereas, you know, don't we usually have dwarves being Scottish?
639561	641563	Well, if you play WoW a lot, yeah, dwarves are Scottish.
641984	643306	Or, you know, Lord of the Rings.
644207	647632	Well, no, he sounded vaguely... He sounded Welsh.
648433	650816	Alright, well, you think you'll play Dragon Age 2 through to completion?
651857	652138	Yeah.
652768	653749	All right, that's good.
653769	654590	It's always good to finish.
655071	656733	I'll take pictures of the lesbian scene.
656913	657554	All right, please do.
657574	659436	All right, let's move on over to Loki.
659716	660677	Loki, how was your gaming week?
660998	661678	It was okay.
661778	669848	I played Motorstorm Apocalypse through rookie mode now, and I think most of the way through pro mode, although...
671189	677215	All the races have been somewhat difficult up until now, and it's just like, oh, and now it's really, really hard.
677896	680699	So I'm actually stuck on one race right now.
681900	683662	But really enjoying it still.
684703	688487	Storyline's still really cheesy, but still pretty fun game.
689107	691310	And then I've been playing...
693159	695141	On my 3DS, really only Pilotwings right now.
695881	703366	And I haven't really played any of the, like, I don't know, the missions or whatever you have to do, the different challenges.
703666	711531	It's been mainly the free flying, which is kind of annoying a little bit because you can only fly around for like a few minutes at a time.
712792	714914	Which is so stupid.
715334	716695	It's like three minutes at a time.
716835	717575	Woo!
718216	718956	Fun!
719116	721598	Well, I mean, you do only have a limited amount of fuel, right?
723129	729073	Well, okay, if you want to go by that route, then why can't I have it where I refuel?
729593	730974	Gas is expensive, you know.
731995	735297	Or like when I'm using the rocket belt, I never get low on fuel.
735377	741581	I could hold that throttle down the whole way, and it just never would run out of fuel.
742162	751728	But I'm basically collecting these markers or whatever they're in the game, and I have 74 of 75 of them, so I'm still trying to find the last one.
753489	756791	It's just like the Woohoo Island thing.
757911	759052	It's like, oh, hey, look at this.
759092	759912	This is kind of cool.
759932	761673	This is from Wii Sports Resort.
761853	764794	Oh, this is the part where you can... Here's the bowling alley.
764894	765974	Here's all this stuff from the game.
765994	769716	I'm like, okay, well, none of this has to do with flying.
770236	772437	Can you crash through the roof of the bowling alley?
772757	773658	No, you can't.
774478	775239	Thank you for watching!
793260	795562	Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time.
815334	824759	There needs to be a dark Pilotwings where you can rocket belt into the bowling alley and steal a baby and run away with it.
825179	829261	Once again, and this is unfortunate, this goes back to Nintendo.
829761	833903	What they do with new games, or I should say games that they put out again.
834844	842027	They basically take them, they don't add any features to it, and they strip it down to what the bare essentials that they need to do another release for are.
842607	844328	Just like all the Animal Crossing games.
844829	845749	And here's the problem.
845809	847510	People like us keep buying them.
847791	851413	Actually, you're the only one that's bought a 3DS in this room.
852113	853494	No, I'm talking about Animal Crossing.
853514	853914	Oh, okay.
854395	859318	No, I'm just saying it's people like us that keep buying those crappy games.
859638	863000	And it just gives them the impression, okay, so we don't really have to do anything.
863020	864041	People just still buy our games.
864541	865822	It's just like the whole Tron thing.
866102	866943	What's different this year?
867263	868864	We put a 12 on the box.
869204	870705	I mean, that's really all it is.
871605	874807	I mean, it's okay.
874927	876227	It's somewhat fun.
876307	877948	I haven't played through everything yet.
878168	882590	But, you know, you're looking at what was on the original Super Nintendo version.
882610	886152	I'm sorry, it's even less content than that.
886172	891954	I mean, you really couldn't, you know, bother to put the extra content in there.
892134	894395	They don't even, like, remove, like, the landing pads and stuff like that.
894415	895716	They're in the different missions and stuff.
895996	896877	They're in the free mode.
896917	903082	They're just all sitting there still because they didn't bother to even say, okay, well, during this mode, this isn't here or whatever.
903142	904443	It's just, it's always there.
905144	907986	Let me get some questions from our chat room at chat.orangeandre.com.
908047	911229	Robert M is asking, Loki, Loki, can you shoot in Pilotwings?
911830	913051	No balloon popping at least?
913251	916054	There's a few levels in the mission mode where you can do that.
916754	917655	Shooting or balloon popping?
918035	918295	Or both?
918696	918816	Both.
918836	919116	Or neither?
919136	919557	Okay.
919577	919697	Okay.
920918	925200	Tiger Claw is asking what they should have done is recreated that helicopter mission from the first Pilotwings.
925781	928042	Most people never even saw those missions.
928603	930104	The first Pilotwings was hard.
930624	935167	Well, they've got some stuff that's undocumented or whatever.
935187	938269	It's not on the box where they have the squirrel suit or whatever.
938349	940531	You could do skydiving in there.
940931	942192	Wait, the squirrel suit?
942472	943092	Thanks for watching!
966138	969040	I'm literally imagining a skydiving squirrel.
969800	971961	It would be cool if it was a skydiving squirrel.
972001	974322	I mean, I'd pay to play that.
974742	977364	But it's just, I don't know.
978384	980545	It's a fun game, I guess.
980765	989470	It's what I've been playing just because I just want to play through some of that because I've played Ridge Racer like a ton and Street Fighter, you know, it's all right.
990810	998275	I saw a question about the battery life earlier in chat, and that's a bitch I've heard as well, is that the battery life isn't really that great on these things.
998355	999816	What has been your experience with the battery?
1000437	1005320	I haven't really had a problem with it because I keep charging it all the time, but I've never had it run out on me.
1006521	1013425	But then again, I also don't leave it in sleep mode because I figured that the battery would go dead and I kind of want to play the game.
1014026	1019750	That's the thing, is they have all these things that rely on sleep mode, and I know that doesn't suck as much battery as playing a game would,
1021310	1025752	You know, if it's running out of battery that fast, then why rely on sleep mode for all this stuff?
1027612	1029673	Let me go to another question from chat, and I think this is a good one.
1030033	1037575	Savalas in our chatroom is asking, at chat.homersonstrider.com, Loki, do you have buyer's remorse with buying the Nintendo 3DS now that we're a week in?
1038355	1038975	No, not really.
1040316	1042716	I mean, I got the few games that I wanted to get, and that's it.
1042836	1044857	And that's what I'm going to plan on getting until...
1046482	1046902	Thanks for watching!
1066628	1086540	and a lot of it you know even the reviewers go this is basically the game that you know came up before but now it's in 3d and it doesn't really utilize 3d that much and you're going to get a lot of that stuff because people don't know how to utilize it or they're going to try to you know cash in real quick especially putting out like a budget game because all the games are $40 so a $20 game stands out because hey that's uh much cheaper but
1087830	1088531	GameDev Story GameDev Story
1106131	1120391	Even the fictional company that's the game publisher of the actual game, their toilet system is not doing well compared to my glory hole system.
1120471	1122875	Yes, that's what's called the glory hole system.
1125819	1127219	Everybody loves a glory hole, so.
1127459	1127960	All right.
1128220	1129380	And then Grand Theft Auto.
1129720	1131441	So that's what I played this week.
1131881	1132181	All right.
1132321	1133541	Let me go over to Salacious Pop.
1133581	1134421	How was your gaming week?
1134821	1135322	It was all right.
1136022	1136522	Pretty slow.
1137702	1149525	Played some Pac-Man Championship Edition DX, some Super Street Fighter IV, a lot of the Mortal Kombat PS3 demo, and I finally got to play Marvel vs. Capcom 3.
1150126	1151286	What did you think of MVC3?
1152556	1153677	I really liked what I saw of it.
1153737	1155038	Definitely want to get it at some point.
1155958	1162882	It has the sort of hybrid four-button controls that the Dreamcast used for Marvel vs. Capcom 2.
1163643	1167125	And then I guess also Tatsunoko vs. Capcom for the Wii uses something similar.
1168085	1191902	and I didn't realize that it played like that so when I was using a six button fight pad I wasn't quite landing the combos that I thought I was because I realized oh well not all the buttons are mapped the way I thought they were there's no you know low medium strong punch low medium strong kick it's they're kind of combined some of them so yeah I loved it it was great was there a particular character you really enjoyed
1193423	1205582	I don't really care for her in the context that she appears in the Marvel Universe, but the female Wolverine clone, X-23 I think her name is, she was fun to use.
1206603	1206804	Cool?
1207024	1207184	Yeah.
1207685	1209067	Anything else you want to share about your game of the week?
1212361	1218904	The fatalities in the Mortal Kombat demo are really gory, but they're all kind of stupid and they're all kind of the same.
1219885	1220205	You think?
1220505	1220745	Yeah.
1221766	1232311	See, here's my whole thing is that I... You know I hate the Saw movies and all that stuff and I talk about this on the show, but yet I giggle so much at Mortal Kombat and all the fatalities and some of them are really bad.
1232792	1235433	Like the Mileena one, what does Mileena do?
1236193	1238835	She walks up to you like she's going to kiss you and then she...
1239515	1241057	Sucks you up and spits you out.
1241117	1243800	No, it's not like you think that's what's going to happen because that's what happens to Olin.
1244181	1246163	But she like rips off your face.
1246283	1257016	She throws her size at you so they're out of your rib cage so you're all spiked and then she makes like this, I guess Melina's always horny or whatever because she's always moaning and cooing.
1257563	1265907	So it looks like she's going to kiss you and then she rips your head off at the jawline so that your chin and jaw is still attached and your body falls over.
1266247	1270969	Then she eats your tongue out of the head that she has in her hand.
1271410	1273591	She doesn't just eat it.
1273611	1276352	She goes... She's got Baraka face.
1276512	1280814	So she eats your tongue out of your severed head and then she just chucks it to the ground like a football.
1280854	1280974	Like...
1282675	1297843	and then she jumps on the camera and like kind of tries to dry hump it right well that's that's if you're that's her non like if you don't do a fatality you just let her fall down and then she like she like smears blood on her boobs because again she's always horny like I don't know what her problem is
1299122	1321912	but yet the whole time I see this for the first time I'm giggling maniacally and like Alan's like what's wrong with you and as soon as I know I don't really appreciate the whole TNA fighter game thing at all because as soon as I saw her buck naked outfit I'm like she's gonna get a yeast infection in that in that onesie she has a naked well it's like all she's not really naked she's wearing she's wearing floss oh like the Vampirella yeah she's wearing floss
1322907	1331293	And the best part is that, you know, this new Mortal Kombat game, like, the blood kind of seems to stay on the characters, and it stays, like, in kind of natural-looking ways.
1331573	1335776	So, like, you know, after she's fighting or whatever, her boobs will be, like, covered in blood, and she's, like, rubbing her boobs.
1335856	1338958	It's all, like, it's really, like, disgusting, but funny.
1338978	1340059	You need to bring this over.
1340519	1341820	It's just a PS3 demo.
1342000	1342700	It's not the game yet.
1343261	1345222	Because the demo has four characters in it.
1345642	1350546	And the fatality for Scorpion, if you look it up in the op menu, is wrong.
1351446	1351926	Oh yeah, yeah.
1352767	1354428	The fatality for Scorpion was just backwards.
1354888	1355068	Yeah.
1355128	1355629	That was funny.
1357590	1358450	Actually, wait, hold on.
1358510	1359491	You know what I should do here?
1359551	1361172	I should actually just pull this up real quick.
1361432	1362613	It is a three hour show.
1362633	1363894	We have time to do some fun things here.
1364554	1367356	Describe Scorpion's fatality for us real quick because that was pretty funny too.
1368076	1389681	um he takes his katana and he slices your head off and then again at the waist but he does it so fast that it's obvious that it's going through you but you're still upright and then he kicks your stomach so your middle piece flies back so then your legs fall and your head goes up in the air and then he cuts your head in half like a like a cantaloupe
1392236	1395298	I love the fruit ninja reference there.
1396098	1397439	Okay, here you go, DarkSakura.
1397479	1397799	You ready?
1398520	1398920	Here you go.
1399100	1399460	Enjoy.
1399480	1409426	That is... See, she's all sexy walking and then... Give me a kiss, boy.
1410486	1410767	Psych.
1418061	1425107	seeing that she's all like rubbing her boobs she's all mmm I just ate that guy's tongue that's the best fatality ever there you go
1430785	1435666	See, Mortal Kombat, I gotta admit, I gave the demo an unfavorable review a couple weeks ago.
1435866	1437346	It is growing on me a little bit.
1437906	1439307	It's growing on me just a little bit.
1439447	1451769	I think having seen some more of the fatalities and getting to do, like, kind of getting more comfortable with the fighting system, because, you know, they took out the whole weapon thing and all that's gone now, so it's a little bit back to old school, and, you know, kind of getting used to that again.
1451849	1452489	It's growing on me.
1452569	1459511	I think I will get the full version, so I can do more fatalities, and Salacious Pop can be very disappointed with me.
1459531	1459591	Yep.
1460271	1460671	and DarkSakura.com
1488377	1489578	I don't want to say that it hurt to look at.
1489758	1494760	It didn't give me a headache, but just running around, something was off about the graphics visually.
1494800	1495680	It was hard to look at.
1495961	1496361	I don't know.
1496481	1499222	But I was like, okay, this is God of War Castlevania and I just deleted it.
1499522	1500923	It originally wasn't a Castlevania game.
1500943	1502464	Oh yeah, that's right.
1502484	1504264	It wasn't supposed to be a Castlevania game originally.
1504865	1508486	Why come out with a new IP when we can just slap Castlevania on it?
1508627	1509047	There you go.
1509887	1515435	SSJ100 Matt is in our chatroom talking about the Mortal Kombat demo and the fatalities saying, Rob, you should show your mom the game.
1515816	1517979	Rob, that's gross, Rob.
1518619	1520863	Actually, that's a great idea for a future OLR YouTube.
1520883	1521483	She looks cold.
1521524	1522325	She needs a jacket.
1522345	1522505	Yeah.
1524744	1525684	We will get right on that.
1525704	1527685	That sounds like a great future OLR YouTube.
1528406	1529606	Rob's mom plays Mortal Kombat.
1529666	1530087	That'd be fun.
1530527	1530827	Good times.
1531227	1532368	Alright, let's see.
1532408	1532968	My Gaming Week.
1533028	1536049	I played a lot of the same stuff that Salacious Pop did, but there was some different things.
1536550	1543473	One night, randomly, we were having You Don't Know Jack, which has kind of become this strange Friday tradition all of a sudden, which I'm kind of liking.
1543853	1545834	Friday night, playing You Don't Know Jack and drinking wine.
1546514	1549716	I think you need stronger booze, but yeah, the booze in You Don't Know Jack is good.
1550817	1551677	Wine keeps it classy.
1551977	1556878	Yes, wine keeps it very classy with the fart jokes and you don't know Jack, which is always hilarious.
1557259	1559139	But then we just started playing like old school games.
1559719	1565141	And when I say old school, I mean like old school on the Xbox Live Arcade and some things they don't even sell anymore.
1565181	1566481	We were playing Smash TV.
1567382	1576364	We were playing the Mortal Kombat 3 Ultimate, the arcade one that was on Xbox Live that's not there anymore.
1576684	1578645	So we were kind of having fun just playing some of those old games and
1579245	1583627	It's neat because you can kind of see how far along the Xbox Live Arcade really has come.
1583807	1587008	I mean, it really was just a bunch of ports in the beginning, and some of them weren't done very well.
1587348	1595772	Like, looking back, now going back and playing the Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, I'm kind of like, well, where's the move list in the game?
1596012	1601314	It's just literally the ROM just dumped and sold on Xbox Live Arcade.
1601334	1603575	So they have come a ways a little bit since then.
1603755	1612720	And, you know, I think back to some of the episodes we were doing back then, and I seem to remember we were complaining about that a lot, that a lot of the releases were just ROMs being dumped on Xbox Live Arcade.
1612740	1615381	And I think Microsoft tried to fix that after the first year or two.
1615461	1616762	They said, okay, no more of that.
1617002	1618282	Well, they added a pause feature.
1619083	1620423	Oh, well.
1620904	1621944	Excuse me, princess.
1622004	1624245	It's not entirely the arcade ROM.
1624285	1625506	No, I get what you're saying, though, but that's.
1625666	1632251	Yeah, well, remember, like, we were playing Mortal Kombat 3, and for some reason, I could remember Kabal combos.
1632291	1634493	Like, Kabal was the character I used to use in Mortal Kombat all the time.
1634833	1638996	And I remember how to make him do the spinny thing, and then punch, punch, uppercut, little laser purple pew-pew beam.
1639416	1640397	I could do all that still.
1640697	1643159	Yet, when it came to fatality time, couldn't remember how to do it.
1643640	1645141	So I'm like, well, let me pause and go to the move list.
1645301	1646262	Oh, there is no move list.
1646722	1649204	It's just pause and reconfigure the buttons, or quit.
1649424	1649844	It's just...
1650905	1654829	So, we had to go on GameFAQs to get the fatality, but then we were like, eh, too lazy to do that.
1654849	1656070	Let's just play something else.
1656310	1657031	Let's play Smash TV.
1658312	1659973	I will say one new game I played this week.
1662476	1667000	I played a free game that's now available on the PlayStation 3 called Free Realms.
1667540	1668241	Ha, ha, ha.
1668661	1673986	Free Realms is a free MMO that is available on the PlayStation 3 and that's what they're calling it.
1674006	1674667	Freemium.
1675167	1675508	It's a what?
1675708	1676228	A freemium.
1676248	1677369	A freemium MMO.
1678731	1683195	And you download this 25 meg file and first I was like, oh shit, this thing's small.
1683235	1684096	This is a small game.
1684396	1688980	Alright, so I launch the game only to wait and download 700 more megabytes.
1689080	1689701	I'm like, fine.
1689861	1690822	Ah, it's PlayStation Home.
1691102	1693445	So I'll go in the other room and play WoW and then come back in an hour.
1694065	1696446	So finally I get in there and it's like, choose your character.
1696506	1698706	And you can do little character customizations.
1698746	1699526	You chose this character.
1699686	1701007	Now I'll need to download that character.
1701867	1703747	You can either be, no, that was the last time I downloaded it.
1703767	1707868	But you can either be a male or female and you can be a human or you can be a fairy.
1708828	1714570	So of course I rolled a man fairy because I figured nobody was going to be playing those in the game.
1714590	1715410	So it would be kind of funny.
1716010	1719911	And, you know, you could, and don't you dare be making jokes because I'll beat you.
1720251	1722613	All right, so anyway, I rolled the character.
1723053	1727996	You can do a custom name, but if you do a custom name, then it has to go to be approved.
1728637	1732179	So you have to choose a name from this slot machine thing.
1732219	1736122	They have all these pre-approved names, a first name, like a middle name, and a last name.
1736582	1741545	I think my name ended up being like Rob, like Forest Tree or something.
1741565	1742686	I don't remember, something really dumb.
1743106	1744967	So I went in there, whatever.
1745548	1746609	And then it's just, okay.
1747469	1748450	Now you're in free realms.
1748510	1748930	Have fun.
1749591	1750372	No tutorial.
1750892	1751513	No setup.
1752173	1752794	No nothing.
1753134	1755496	Just, okay, here you are.
1755616	1755797	What?
1755817	1756537	Tutorial?
1756617	1757038	What is this?
1757538	1758519	A paid game?
1759400	1762042	So I was like, okay, well, I kind of figured it out, I think.
1762482	1765265	Like, I went around and figured out how to start mining.
1765585	1767127	And I was like, okay, I'm going to mine.
1767467	1770430	So the mining game is kind of like, I don't know, it's like...
1771030	1772491	There's a game like that on Gaia.
1772831	1775734	It sounds like Puzzle Quest 2 when you have to pick lock a chest or bash open a door.
1775754	1776594	There's a sort of
1790385	1792427	Thank you for watching!
1808019	1818029	and I noticed that in the quest, if you did not want to try to find the NPC that's the next step of the quest, you could just hit R2 and your character would just auto-fly there.
1818189	1819050	I fly because I'm a fairy.
1819891	1821733	You just auto-fly there or whatever.
1822414	1824235	And okay, so it made it really easy.
1824516	1825517	So I kind of figured it out.
1825557	1827138	This MMO is really for kids.
1827439	1828500	It's a kid's MMO.
1828560	1830161	How many people were wandering around...
1831102	1832143	I don't know, I didn't try to chat.
1832163	1833404	I don't want to talk to these people.
1833464	1835666	I just want to figure out what the game is.
1835726	1839169	And so I gathered it is a bunch of mini-games thrown together to make an MMO.
1856044	1856744	I don't know if you saw...
1877972	1882797	It's like saying, well our game is actually really, really similar to Minecraft.
1882857	1884238	I'm like, what?
1884778	1886220	No, it was nothing like Minecraft.
1886520	1892145	But apparently the house building or some crap in there is similar to Minecraft, but not.
1892225	1896089	You can customize your house, but it struck me a little more Animal Crossing than it did Minecraft.
1896169	1897170	It's not Minecraft.
1897190	1898131	He's just stupid.
1898191	1900073	Well, and here's the other thing, folks.
1900553	1905096	Once I got to like the fourth level of mining, it was like, do you want to play more mining?
1905377	1907779	Become a member today of Free Realms.
1907819	1908359	So that was it.
1908919	1915064	So essentially, this MMO is just all these little mini games, but you can play all the mini games up to level four.
1915485	1917206	And then it's like, oh, you got to be a member.
1917326	1918287	So it's Sodium One.
1918627	1919527	Yeah, basically.
1919868	1923029	So, I'm sorry, that's not a free MMO.
1923489	1926290	This is a demo of a pay MMO.
1926930	1931632	This is another instance of a game company using deceptive terms to market their product.
1931932	1934333	Because a lot of people are probably going to check this out because it's a free MMO.
1934353	1936334	And I'm here to tell you it is not a free MMO.
1936674	1939115	It is a demo of an MMO.
1939135	1940956	And I know what their defense would be is that...
1941656	1948223	Well, once you capitalize, you can still be in the world and you can still talk to people and you can still customize your fairy.
1948443	1956010	And to their defense, and I hate going to their defense, but their defense actually is a pretty cheap MMO.
1956030	1957532	$35 for a lifetime membership.
1957952	1960515	But once again, why would you want to do that?
1962079	1964702	Pay $0.99 and get the same games on the iPhone.
1964742	1966243	It's really the same deal.
1966263	1973610	$35 for a lifetime membership, but there's no reason to believe the longevity would be more than two years before they shut the servers down because no one's going to play it.
1974831	1975392	Here's the thing.
1975552	1977074	I will give it this credit.
1977094	1979036	I thought it was kind of dopey.
1979236	1983300	I played it maybe twice, and I was like, okay, I think I've done everything there is to do in this game.
1984021	1985624	I see it more like a kid's MMO.
1985844	1989632	I think that's where they've obviously taken a lot of safety precautions.
1989712	1991074	A lot of it's kind of watered down.
1991135	1992638	I think this is something more for kids.
1993018	1995744	But here is where they screwed it royally.
1996325	1997506	There's no tutorial.
1997586	2001709	There's nothing to kind of help you understand what you're supposed to do in this game.
2002189	2006292	And I think a lot of kids would get really frustrated with it.
2006632	2008453	I think this would really have to be right.
2008493	2010334	I think there's a very specific age range.
2010374	2016499	It's probably like 10 to 13 year old girls I think would enjoy Free Realms and maybe some boys.
2016599	2017339	But I don't know.
2017459	2021082	Just just strikes me as more of a girly game because there's not a lot of violence.
2021122	2022683	And yes, I'm being totally sexist right now.
2023343	2023863	Justine Beaver
2046900	2049383	I assume Free Realms is the same on the PC as far as the freemium model.
2049403	2049603	I think so.
2049623	2049723	Yes.
2049763	2049883	Okay.
2068784	2070747	I wasn't really motivated to go check.
2070767	2071447	You'll have to excuse me.
2071467	2082760	I think this is not necessarily... I mean, granted, it's a way... I think it's going to get a lot of exposure to people that might not normally try it because it's integrated with the PlayStation Network and it's...
2083621	2108126	technically free to start playing it, but it can also be used as kind of data for them because they're working on a new EverQuest, they're working on some other, I forget what else, there's another IP that they're working on a sequel for that's also an MMO, but work on this to see what works, what doesn't work, and it's a good way, imagine if EverQuest came out the next one as a
2109367	2109607	Home,
2128724	2129565	and DarkSakura.com.
2151346	2151787	DarkSakura.com
2166608	2195156	so I don't know it strikes me as odd that they're and I realize it's different development teams Sony's a huge company and the free realms already existed in some regard on the PC so I mean but it just seems weird to me that home after all these years still I don't see the point of logging in to home regularly there's nothing for me to really check every day I don't know so anyhow that was my gaming week talked a lot about free realms and you know some of the other mini things or something like that in free realms
2195576	2198397	I think they have guilds.
2198437	2200398	Can you invite the people to your house?
2200798	2202539	Your guild members to your house?
2203579	2205340	Honestly, Loki, I didn't play that far.
2205360	2208921	You probably can, and that's more people that can come to your house than fucking home.
2209421	2209902	Awesome.
2209962	2210982	Way to go, Sony.
2211022	2211642	Bravo.
2212563	2219045	I am confident in saying, though, that if there are TVs in free realms, you can't put videos or pictures on them, just like home.
2219525	2220706	I'm pretty confident in saying that.
2222447	2225229	That still doesn't matter if no one can see them.
2226330	2227712	Only so many people can come to your house.
2227792	2228833	Sorry, sorry.
2229574	2235359	If we have any more people in this house, it's going to violate the fire code and the marshal's going to come down here.
2235419	2236921	We don't want any of that stuff.
2237001	2239763	I mean, just don't want to mess with that.
2240604	2241645	Alright, let's move on.
2241665	2243606	We're going to get into some actual video game news here.
2243666	2247349	Of course, our chatroom, chat.orangeloungeradio.com if you want to join us live on this Sunday evening.
2248170	2254294	Real quick housekeeping, I may not be here in a couple weeks, so we may have a guest host in a couple weeks.
2254314	2255675	I don't know, I've talked to the other hosts about that.
2255775	2257357	I'm not going to be here in a couple weeks.
2257637	2258257	Which week's that?
2258297	2258618	Is that the 17th?
2259558	2259919	Yes.
2260579	2262381	But maybe we're not going to be here at all that week.
2262421	2262981	Where are you going to be?
2263101	2265963	I'm not going to be anywhere, but my wife's going to be somewhere, so I've got to watch the baby.
2266043	2266804	Okay, gotcha.
2266864	2267805	She's going to a wedding.
2267925	2274811	Well, then I'm going to safely say we are probably not going to be here at all on the 17th, which is in two weeks, because that is also the night I need to be out.
2275031	2277853	I am going in for Mensa testing, though, on the 16th, which is pretty awesome.
2277873	2278634	Mensa testing?
2278674	2279634	Yes, Mensa testing.
2280255	2281596	Okay, I have to know more about this.
2281656	2283017	Why are you taking the Mensa test?
2283377	2284038	It's fun.
2284298	2284899	Just for what...
2285599	2290505	Did you just sit there and you were just kind of like watching the Food Network and then suddenly it just dawns on you, I should take the Mensa test.
2290545	2291365	I don't even remember what it was.
2292006	2296711	Somehow I got directed to the test that's on their website and I did really well on that.
2297212	2304339	I've been playing around with their iPhone app and I was just like, eh, this is all good and all, but I want to actually try the real test.
2304660	2304760	And
2305860	2313542	I mean, even just looking at what questions, I mean, obviously the questions in the app aren't necessarily the same questions, but they have the similar types of questions.
2313802	2321544	I don't see how it's really a valid IQ test, because you really only have to be good at answering certain types of questions, and that's it.
2321724	2322604	Only you, Loki.
2322704	2324244	This is so typical of you on the show.
2324504	2329105	You're openly questioning why anyone would want to become a Mensa member, yet you're scheduled to take the test.
2329165	2331106	No, I just want to... I just want... Hey, no, hey.
2331986	2339212	Listen, I just want to try it just for the hell of it, and hey, if I'm accepted into it, great, that's something else to put on my resume.
2341934	2343235	Whatever, it doesn't matter.
2343315	2344957	I want to take the Mensa test.
2344977	2345537	You should.
2346498	2347359	It's 40 bucks.
2347659	2348319	That's not that bad.
2348339	2349740	40 bucks and you got to go to a, there's a guy.
2349760	2351582	That's how much brain age costs, right?
2351602	2357867	There's a guy that does it once a month down in Dixon, and you just go down there and you go take the test, it's an hour and a half, and that's it.
2360000	2361721	I don't think Rob should take it.
2361901	2362121	Why?
2362141	2363802	Because then I'm going to fail and I'm going to cry?
2363882	2364343	Is that why?
2365163	2378972	If you pass, whatever sort of weird, totally irrational opinion you ever have in your life, politically or for anything else, well, I'm a member of Mensa, so I think maybe that my opinion is a bit more important than yours.
2378992	2383535	All you have to be good at, I mean, seriously, it's mostly math and it's mostly pattern finding.
2383835	2390597	So if you can find patterns and kind of think a little bit out of the box, I guess, that's it.
2390997	2391877	You'll be fine.
2393718	2397919	Once again, I still don't understand how it's really a valid... Whatever, though.
2398099	2398759	I'll take the test.
2399399	2407321	I probably won't qualify because you have to be in the 98th percentile of the United States in order to be accepted in there.
2407381	2410622	So I'd assume that's probably close to getting everything correctly.
2410762	2411583	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2428962	2456188	I don't know about that they have dating though like a dating thing you can date other Mensa members it's stupid but it'd be cool to put on like you know to get the little you know award or whatever the hell they have they're all hey you've been accepted in you know that'd be kind of cool but you know beyond do I really want to be like a functioning member fuck that I don't want to be a member of that society well now are you going to get excommunicated from Mensa if any of the members hear this program eh no
2458095	2462557	Well, I've had... I used to get letters all the time to go take the test.
2463137	2466698	I never wanted to do it because I thought it was stupid and pretentious.
2466718	2468039	All these fucking smart people.
2468099	2473901	I'm just sitting here going... If you can bring your Mensa card to Cold Stone and get a buck off, it's like, yeah, hell yeah.
2474261	2477523	Free side of pancakes at Denny's because fucking Mensa card.
2477543	2478543	Hell yeah.
2479203	2480244	Smart people got it going on.
2480264	2481404	Yeah, is Mensa like AAA?
2481424	2482104	Will they come change my tire?
2482124	2482885	I don't think it's like AAA.
2486340	2486780	I don't know.
2486900	2487581	So we'll see.
2487681	2489142	We'll see what ends up happening there.
2490983	2492044	I probably won't pass it.
2492224	2496987	I mean, because there's a certain type of question from playing the game.
2497027	2499569	There's a certain type of question that stumps me, usually.
2500009	2503352	It's because a lot of it, and they only do certain types.
2503512	2509516	It's a few rows of numbers, and at the very end, there's four rows of four.
2509856	2512718	And you're supposed to figure out what the pattern is between all of them.
2513018	2513559	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2532919	2536881	Although I've gone back, though, and actually looked at some of these and go, okay, so that's how they're doing it.
2537121	2543825	And you find, you know, I don't know if it's breaking the test or anything, but you find there's certain patterns to the way they ask questions and stuff.
2543865	2546566	And, okay, I got to look for these types of things.
2546767	2547367	Oh, there it is.
2547787	2549048	And away you go.
2549648	2550869	So, I don't know.
2551649	2554551	It just sounds interesting, a challenge or something.
2554571	2554931	I don't know.
2555031	2557872	Well, I'm busy this month, but if you go next month, let me know.
2557912	2558453	I'll go with you.
2558473	2559173	Yeah, it's on the 16th.
2559353	2560213	This month.
2560374	2561214	That's a horrible day.
2561274	2561974	I can't do that day.
2562254	2562535	Okay.
2562615	2563195	Maybe next month.
2563255	2563495	All right.
2564295	2567957	Randy's in our chatroom at chat.orange.com and says, Sky at the Mensa test.
2568117	2569438	This is like brain age, right?
2569458	2569978	Yeah.
2570378	2571399	This is me at the Mensa test.
2571699	2571959	Red.
2572639	2572980	Yellow.
2573680	2573980	Blue.
2574220	2575181	It's really... Blue.
2575501	2576561	A big... Bro!
2577622	2578882	It's really a big IQ test.
2579062	2579142	Yeah.
2579162	2579663	That's all it is.
2579723	2579943	I know.
2581063	2583124	I wasn't gifted and talented when I was a kid.
2583184	2584285	That counts for something, right?
2584305	2584385	Yeah.
2587235	2612864	AkumaJP in our chatroom says just show them your boobs and that's it, pass I don't know if that would work I don't think that's how it works Alright, anyhow, let's move on Actually get into some gaming news tonight MensaTalk was way better than talking about the Twitter and the Facebook and all that I can just picture our mailbag now though filling up with emails You don't understand Mensa, you're very rude
2613980	2616479	No, I understand it completely, I'm just, you know
2618183	2624945	I want to become a member, but I want to become a non-participating member of Mensa.
2624985	2626645	Is that too much to ask?
2628325	2629666	I just want to be on the roster.
2629706	2631446	I don't necessarily want to go to the meetings.
2631466	2633527	I don't want to attend some Mensa conference.
2633767	2634407	I don't care.
2634687	2636747	I don't care about talking about political issues.
2637307	2639828	I just want the damn badge or whatever.
2639868	2640888	Just want it on your resume.
2641228	2642129	Exactly.
2642149	2643029	How about gaming news?
2643069	2643649	Video games?
2643709	2643949	Hello.
2644349	2644749	All right.
2645410	2652315	Well, I guess I should be sad about this, but Mega Man Universe has been canceled.
2652355	2652715	That's right.
2652735	2667766	It's the game that was basically kind of a remade Mega Man 2 with some customizable characters and user-created levels and really didn't look that great, in my opinion, but some people were really gung-ho about it.
2668147	2668767	It's canceled.
2668807	2669248	Too bad.
2669668	2670188	So sad.
2670548	2672310	Their decision, I guess, was...
2674211	2675652	Caused by various circumstances.
2675752	2677713	That's such a detailed explanation.
2678854	2687579	And, of course, they're saying that maybe that has to do with the departure of the Mega Man creator and, you know, the universe lead designer, Kenji Inafune.
2690621	2692202	So, I don't know.
2693563	2695284	It just looked like Mega Man powered up.
2695724	2695904	Just...
2697361	2706625	It looked interesting to me, so of course I'm a little bit disappointed that it got cancelled But at the same time, if the game really did suck, then they did the right thing
2717469	2718350	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2740826	2754796	All of the levels, all of the bosses, you know, something like that where you can have your customized character, but you're fighting, you know, how, I don't even know how many, you know, boss characters it would be, but just like, you know, almost a hundred, you know, different characters.
2754876	2757597	Well, remember when we only knew the title and nothing else?
2757738	2762481	That's what most people were speculating it was, is that, oh, Mega Man Universe is finally going to be that clusterfuck.
2763018	2764879	Yeah, I mean, it would be really awesome.
2764959	2771082	Like, okay, well, let's see what, you know, this weapon does to this character from a different game, you know, and stuff like that.
2771102	2781066	I mean, it actually, if I remember correctly, I think Mega Man 2 did have that kind of in when you're going through the Wily stages where they had the old, you know, one characters and you had to figure out what weapons did what.
2781086	2783087	I don't believe the one characters ever showed up in two.
2783247	2784868	It's the two characters showed up in three.
2785248	2787809	You had to replay the stages, the corner stages in three.
2788389	2788930	I remember that.
2788970	2789310	It's weird.
2790010	2790390	Got it.
2790470	2790710	Okay.
2791171	2791751	I was close.
2792211	2793152	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2815546	2816847	I am very looking forward to that.
2817387	2818287	Legends was awesome.
2819408	2821489	All right, well, some news going on with Xbox.
2821729	2826431	There is a new dashboard apparently on the way, and there's a preview that was being rolled out.
2826671	2832813	Major Nelson had put out the call on his blog that there is going to be another Xbox 360, I guess, beta test, if you will.
2832833	2833894	They call it a preview program.
2833934	2839036	It's basically a beta test where they did this a little while ago with the new Xbox experience.
2839076	2840937	I think they did it again with the new Netflix and all that.
2841537	2849042	Yeah, I did it last time when they have that, and I didn't do it this time for a couple reasons.
2849562	2856407	Well, mainly because I hated having to update my system all the damn time, because it would be like, oh, we got another update, oh, we got another update, and you know, just...
2856847	2860492	All these updates rolling out a few times a day, and it was annoying.
2860792	2866940	And seriously, not worth my getting a copy of Halo Reach, even if it is in this new format.
2866980	2868762	And I am kind of curious to see what the new format is.
2870224	2870544	I don't know.
2870625	2871706	It's just not really worth it.
2872466	2876548	What's also interesting about this beta test program, everybody's getting a free copy of Halo Reach with it.
2876708	2879189	So there is definitely something in it for folks here.
2879770	2885292	And the reason why it's coming with Halo Reach is because there is a new disc format that's basically being beta tested with this whole thing.
2886052	2889274	And that a lot of people are kind of assuming, oh, well, this is to basically...
2891455	2893157	Don't copy that floppy in the piracy hole.
2893377	2893917	All that stuff.
2893957	2895298	This is there to update that.
2895678	2896939	And that is probably true.
2897099	2898300	That's a big part of this as well.
2898680	2901362	But apparently there's something else going on.
2901522	2903764	This is from a website called Digital Foundry.
2904164	2912570	Apparently saying that the new disk format that Microsoft's going to put in this new Xbox update, it's going to give an extra gigabyte of the disk back.
2912910	2916091	So they're basically creating a new gig of space on the disc.
2916111	2921153	I don't know if that's maybe using the outside layer or maybe some type of copy partition they were using.
2921313	2925475	They had a video partition or something like that or a certain partition that was in there.
2926035	2927596	Actually, it was weird.
2927616	2932198	I think it was either the security partition or the video partition.
2932338	2932698	Here it is.
2932818	2939501	There was over a gigabyte dedicated to a DVD video partition that also contained anti-piracy security sectors.
2939781	2940401	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2964566	2965867	Thanks for watching!
2986039	2986599	Who cares?
2986819	2994863	Okay, so I pop this in my DVD player, because I'm an idiot, and it comes up with, you know, some Xbox logo.
2994903	2997084	That doesn't say that this is... Oh, is that what happens?
2997604	3000065	I've never thought to put an Xbox 360 disc in a regular DVD player.
3000085	3000885	Yes, that's what it will do.
3001005	3002506	So it's that video partition.
3002886	3005087	And so it'll go, oh, this is an Xbox disc.
3005107	3006767	You have to play it in your Xbox 360.
3007448	3010249	Well, how about you just don't do that, and then all it'll do is can't read disc.
3010729	3011889	Or just have a picture.
3012430	3013910	Hey, idiot, this is for an Xbox 360.
3013950	3014030	Bye.
3015871	3017051	It could just be a static picture.
3017071	3018011	It pretty much is a picture.
3018052	3021332	I'm surprised that it takes a gigabyte of space for that.
3021492	3025013	I mean, it seems like an awful lot for just a little picture.
3025973	3032735	SSJ100 Matt in our chatroom at chat.orangelandradio.com is asking, So will these free copies of Halo Reach go towards its overall sales numbers?
3033355	3037996	I think maybe throwing back a little bit to when they were giving Guitar Hero Van Halen free with Guitar Hero 5.
3038316	3038756	Remember that?
3039316	3068429	yes but it doesn't really matter at this point anyways because I mean the sales of it's probably dropped quite a bit SolarFlare in our chatroom says it will still be behind Blu-ray though interesting point you know that is one thing that holds CX Plus 360 back a little bit you know and we do have a lot of companies that want to port their games to both systems so I bet there's a lot of games out there on the PS3 that aren't really realizing their full potential of Blu-ray and this will not just help the 360 games expand but I think it will help the PS3 ports expand too right?
3070061	3071443	Um, no.
3071703	3088137	I mean, a little bit maybe, but I don't really think it's going to make a huge difference because if those companies are holding back their ports just because of space issues or whatever, or if they're porting it to multiple systems using the same assets, then it's not a huge deal, I don't think.
3088157	3092061	I mean, if they really wanted to, they could just uncompress everything for the Blu-ray, but
3092901	3105391	With Blu-ray, the whole problem was that it's slow, especially that data on the inside is really slow compared to the stuff on the edge of the disc.
3105951	3108293	So it's just...
3109554	3109874	I don't know.
3110174	3111315	I don't think it's going to make a huge difference.
3111335	3113736	There's not a lot of games that utilize all the space on there as well.
3114396	3116197	Let me close on this question here for this story.
3116417	3121920	SolarFlare in our chatroom asks, are they trying to make time to having to break out the next-gen console?
3122380	3133685	You know, we have noticed a lot of, in this generation of games, and, you know, part of it you could blame on the recession, part of it is this whole 10-year cycle or whatever they're talking about, but you have noticed that especially the 360 has had its life extended...
3134105	3135366	DarkSakura has some more Xbox news for us.
3163584	3165865	I do if I don't drop my mic.
3166065	3171168	This actually has to do with the live indie games issue on Xbox Live about the ratings.
3171648	3175270	You know, we had said that we had a feeling that the ratings were kind of fixed.
3175871	3177471	You know, that they might have been manipulated.
3177812	3184055	And it turns out that it actually might be the X and A Creators Club.
3185056	3185456	Excuse me.
3186136	3192879	actually tweeted that, and I quote, we are investigating a possible misuse of ratings on XBLIG titles.
3193559	3195440	We'll announce more information here as it develops.
3195480	3203984	So basically, it's been coming to people's attention that ratings have gone from really high to just dropping drastically.
3204544	3206825	And so they're fairly certain that there's manipulation behind it.
3207327	3217871	So if the fraud is true, is it being used to bolster the ratings of games that maybe are terrible or to lower stuff that competitors don't want you to buy?
3217891	3226375	It wasn't necessarily that they were being manipulated, but it wasn't by the whim of a certain publisher.
3226395	3230096	Basically, it was that one lacrosse game that was on there.
3230216	3232397	They tweeted their fellows, hey, give us a five-star rating.
3232777	3238479	Well, the people that are fans of the game also took it upon themselves to rate the other games one star that were in the area.
3238860	3245002	So they, you know, inadvertently created like, you know, ratings fixing almost.
3245582	3252405	But it's just because there's no real system in place to where you have to purchase the game in order to rate it and that kind of stuff.
3253045	3253986	Oh yeah, I guess that's true.
3254006	3255526	So you can just rate it regardless.
3256587	3261289	Yeah, it seems to be highly unfair that someone should be able to rate something that they haven't played, so...
3261940	3269285	Yeah, because I thought that you, you know, spent your one to three bucks or your two to four hundred, whatever, Microsoft space bucks.
3269786	3271046	I'm like, wow, this is terrible.
3271087	3276010	And then you can give it two stars after you've at least played the demo or bought it.
3276070	3276751	But I guess not.
3276791	3278332	You can just do what you want.
3278352	3280193	Well, they're looking into it, apparently.
3280293	3283095	So maybe they'll realize that was one big oversight.
3284456	3286678	To be honest, doesn't iTunes have that same problem?
3287198	3289860	I mean, I could go in and rate podcasts a one that I've never listened to.
3290547	3292531	Well, not with the apps.
3292632	3296399	I think you can only rate them after you've used them.
3296800	3297281	Perhaps.
3298023	3300127	I know that if you delete an app, it asks you to rate it.
3300147	3301450	Yeah.
3302683	3305764	Which, by the way, you should leave Orange Noms Radio a five-star review on iTunes.
3305804	3306284	Do it.
3306444	3306624	Yes.
3307024	3310105	We actually had a couple nice ones this past week, so thank you guys for doing that.
3310145	3310825	Really appreciate it.
3311305	3317767	That kind of stuff does help because when we get more five-star reviews on iTunes, it kind of bumps you up in the listing and just helps us get more exposure.
3318827	3321368	Add more people to our chat room and make it a bigger party on Sunday nights.
3321388	3323389	We need to be as exposed as Melina's boobs.
3324349	3324989	If not more so.
3325289	3325489	Yeah.
3325549	3325909	That's right.
3326529	3326789	All right.
3326829	3327250	Moving on.
3327310	3327610	Loki.
3328610	3328750	Yeah.
3330134	3332515	Oh, by the way, the people doing this, total dicks.
3332635	3333455	I forgot to say that earlier.
3336276	3338597	Another cancellation story.
3338737	3346659	This isn't a big surprise because this has been delayed forever and I remember playing it back a couple... God, how many E3s ago was that that I actually played this?
3346839	3352021	But Sony Online Entertainment has confirmed that they have cancelled the agency.
3353001	3353901	It will not be coming out.
3357162	3359024	You know, it was late forever.
3359044	3361747	It was a spy MMO.
3362668	3364049	Kind of a cool little game, but...
3365399	3365679	Oh well.
3365819	3371184	Man, I'm just keeping Sad Trombone open in a window tonight, because there's a lot of just cancellation news.
3371284	3391461	Kind of alluding to what I was talking about before when we were talking about Free Realms, they're also saying that the company is discontinuing production of the title to focus on developing resources on delivering two new MMOs based on its renowned Planetside and EverQuest properties, while also maintaining its current portfolio of online games.
3391921	3397868	So, maybe a new free-to-play EverQuest?
3398308	3402653	I'm surprised just a straight-up port of the first EverQuest game hasn't shown up on PS3 yet.
3402934	3405677	Because there's still shit-tons of people playing old-school EverQuest.
3405737	3407419	There's, what, like 20-something expansions?
3407799	3408300	It's crazy.
3408700	3410462	But, you know, people invested a lot in that game.
3411343	3412124	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3431580	3442063	so you know yeah new loyalty mount for like as if you have a concurrent subscription like City of Heroes does that for how long you've been paying for the game for Ultima Online when did that come out?
3442924	3460449	I was one of the first MMOs period it was a long time ago it was probably like 99 it was a long time ago yeah it was like 12 or 13 year loyalty 1997 okay yeah so yeah so if they're still around then so is the EverQuest people yeah
3463900	3464620	Boy, oh boy.
3466381	3469884	I think it's when you invest so much time into something, it's hard to walk away from it.
3470344	3471685	And for me, that's a lot of wow.
3471725	3472265	It's hard for me.
3472565	3480031	I was really interested in DC Universe, but I've been having a hard time saying, I'm going to really invest this time in DC Universe because all my friends are on wow.
3480871	3481732	This is tough.
3481812	3483634	Just type a slash played and see.
3484634	3485195	I'll cry.
3485595	3485855	All right.
3486336	3489318	Spassinator in our chat room says the agency being canceled.
3489599	3492141	How the flying fuck can anyone not see that coming?
3493598	3494238	Well, I don't know.
3494379	3496160	I don't know if I would say I saw it coming.
3497300	3503284	I did notice it was an awfully long development cycle, but MMOs on consoles have just become so unpredictable.
3504165	3506607	And most of the news is really bad.
3508368	3510249	What are they doing wrong?
3510529	3514152	Why do consoles just seem to not be able to get MMOs?
3514612	3520876	The lone exception being probably DC Universe, maybe Final Fantasy XI, but that game is a little old now.
3521337	3522958	So what is it about
3524258	3525139	and DarkSakura.com.
3546467	3556754	It's an assembly line of just how many games you can churn through in a certain amount of time, but you buy a certain amount of games in a year and you want to get through them all, whereas an MMO is really open-ended.
3556794	3565260	You never get to the end of WoW, and that's sort of the culture or the attitude that is more appropriate for PCs, if that makes sense.
3565700	3577869	I'm with you to a point, but then I ask, what about Halo, where it thrives on, it's at least, you know, the older games, especially 2, thrived on online, which didn't really have a beginning and an end.
3577909	3580150	Maybe a match had a beginning and an end, I don't know.
3580310	3583332	Well, yeah, those are broken up into matches, yeah.
3583713	3583973	Let's see.
3585472	3587735	GameGuru in our chatroom flat out says because it is not WoW
3598809	3600991	I don't know.
3601031	3604333	I'm a big supporter of WoW, although I don't always agree with everything Blizzard does.
3604473	3607775	But I think there's room for more than one.
3608876	3611578	A game like DC Universe, I don't think it's a failure.
3611718	3613379	I don't know how that game has been selling.
3613439	3614720	I think it's been doing okay.
3615380	3620804	But right now, okay in the console universe is better than anything else right now.
3620904	3621504	Than no-kay?
3621824	3622505	Yeah, than no-kay.
3622845	3624006	EVE Online is still kicking.
3624146	3627347	Doesn't have WoW's numbers, but it's definitely got its market share.
3627367	3628728	There's people still doing Perfect World.
3629008	3630608	Final Fantasy XI still has supporters.
3630908	3631869	Guild Wars.
3631889	3632549	Shit.
3633329	3637231	Ultima Online and EverQuest still have lots of people to play.
3637531	3640092	Lineage 2, still a fucking huge game.
3640172	3641453	It's really big in Korea.
3641473	3642513	Yeah, just not here in the US.
3643634	3645154	So, let's see.
3645174	3646215	Going to our chat room again.
3647135	3650297	Brad from PodCulture says, wouldn't Phantasy Star Online count?
3650617	3651057	Kind of.
3652086	3657851	Well, I thought it was cool that Sega actually let people transfer their characters to private servers.
3658892	3659472	That was cool.
3660513	3665117	And so it was like, well, we have to close it, but I know there's still people doing it.
3665137	3666318	And there was Phantasy Star Universe.
3667819	3669160	Fancy Star Online Fancy Star Online
3696727	3697708	PSO Diablo Dungeon Crawling
3712186	3715568	I really started liking PSO when I started playing online.
3717069	3718150	I'm sorry, on the computer.
3718570	3720971	You know what I think really hurt PSO?
3721151	3724313	You know what really, really hurt that franchise more than anything, I think?
3724353	3724853	PSU?
3725534	3726954	No, I would say it was before that.
3727014	3728515	I would say it was the GameCube game.
3729596	3734639	Because Nintendo just aborted online support.
3735439	3744746	literally told Sega, sure, we'll help you out with this, you know, MMO thing and put out this broadband adapter or anything and then Nintendo just basically said, ah, fuck it.
3745026	3745747	LOL, JK.
3746167	3748108	No, here's what I think was even worse.
3748609	3751451	The Dreamcast version in the US, no online play.
3752251	3758956	You had to do this little thing to manipulate it to get it to play online because it wouldn't support the broadband adapter.
3759136	3764342	Yeah, I imported that or I did something where... Yeah, I could play the Dreamcast one online.
3764362	3765163	I had the Ethernet.
3765223	3766385	I had the modem though.
3766945	3768287	Well, no, we had that too.
3768467	3771671	It was like it was something that you had to manipulate in the menu.
3772051	3777678	The DNS, I think, or your IP, you had to put in something to force it to go out through the Ethernet.
3777998	3780239	Yeah, you had to do something to it to get it to work.
3780419	3781759	I don't remember having that problem.
3781779	3782740	I just remember it working.
3783540	3784060	Oh, whatever.
3784160	3784920	It's been so long.
3785641	3797265	Well, I guess, and also going back to the agency, thematically, a spy MMO, I don't know, something about MMOs is you have to, even in Phantasy Star Online, you're not killing literal dragons, but it's whimsical fantasy sci-fi.
3798005	3801287	You know, no one wants to get together with their five friends and smuggle microfiche.
3801307	3802508	Matrix Online ended.
3803068	3806911	Anything that I've noticed... Well, City of Heroes is still going... Star Trek Online is still going strong.
3807671	3808752	I love Star Trek Online.
3808972	3810733	In fact, I need to pay for a month, but...
3811653	3815577	I don't think an MMO has to be swords and dragons and mystical stuff.
3815617	3817659	It has to be fantasy.
3818080	3820302	That's a tried and true method.
3820703	3822325	That's an established formula.
3822365	3824247	That's a formula that's working right now.
3824767	3826249	That's WoW's formula, in a way.
3827611	3829012	But now they have goblins with motorcycles.
3829893	3831916	I think we haven't really seen the other type.
3831956	3834519	But then again, EVE Online is a space game.
3835059	3837382	DC Universe, not really dragons.
3838103	3840346	Star Trek Online, totally different thing.
3840386	3843910	But Star Trek's a whole separate fandom too, you know?
3844110	3844311	Like...
3844605	3845285	Star Trek Online
3868976	3870737	Alright, let's move on from MMO Chat.
3870817	3872778	We're running a little long because of MMO Chat.
3873098	3874399	Let's do some other quick stories here.
3874699	3880282	I got a story about GameStop, and GameStop apparently has bought, absorbed some more companies.
3880442	3885305	They bought Spawn Labs, and they've also bought a company called Impulse.
3885405	3886866	Now, what the hell did these things do?
3887246	3895771	Okay, Spawn Labs, they did this high-def box set that apparently was... I guess it sounds to me a lot like the whole...
3897572	3898612	OnLive system.
3898673	3899693	It's kind of similar to that.
3899753	3901614	So that's one thing they've absorbed.
3901995	3920007	And then they also got Impulse, which apparently is going to have three parts to it, which is the client, the Impulse client, which you can use to download games, the Reactor, which is like DRM management and copy protection and all of that, letting the developers do achievement, friends lists, and all the kind of like Steam, Xbox Live stuff.
3920047	3920967	Sounds like a Steam clone.
3921708	3925931	And then Impulse Publisher, which is real-time reporting and management tools.
3926731	3951700	GameStop has bought these companies so in a way I sort of see this as them thinking ahead a little bit because these companies have more to do with online distribution and something that isn't so much the stores you know they did not buy stores in this acquisition well they did but it's a different type you know so I have a feeling they are thinking ahead as to this whole how do we counter digital distribution they're absorbing more and more into their collective
3952454	3953214	A little bit, yes.
3953575	3957976	But, you know, that doesn't mean all the mall stores are going to shut down next week.
3958096	3963858	But, I don't know, this digital distribution thing, if I was kind of in this GameStop industry, I'd be a little freaked out right now.
3964838	3968700	Well, maybe not right this second, but, you know, five years from now, this could be...
3969720	3970241	Thanks for watching!
3985692	4001106	so I feel like GameStop you know and again I don't mean to like panic people or whatever this is years away you know these things happening but but GameStop buying this I think they're trying to kind of put themselves in a position where they are like like Blockbuster got in on it early that's what this seems like to me they're setting up a safety net yeah
4004009	4008553	I don't have any details because I really don't think I know any more store managers.
4009514	4014318	But from what I've noticed, I'll go into a GameStop and it'll be dead empty.
4014958	4015659	There'll be no one in there.
4016620	4019382	And I think that it's just, first of all, a sign of the economy.
4019442	4019983	And another thing...
4020763	4035149	And this is actually, I'm not going to go into it because it's a little bit more on the psychology level, but I think that people are becoming more isolated, wanting to do more things from home, not wanting to go out amongst people.
4035790	4037430	You know what I mean?
4037930	4041332	That's why online services have become so popular.
4042292	4043753	You know, people need to get out of the house.
4044013	4045894	See, I've played devil's advocate here, though, a little bit.
4045954	4048495	The one by his house in South San Francisco, always packed.
4049266	4050327	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4070486	4075750	Let's see, go into our chatroom at chat.orange.radio.com SolarFlare says they're going to have to do some good stuff to compete with Steam.
4076551	4081115	I think that's what part of all this is, is to really align themselves in a way where they can.
4081455	4091304	Maybe they'll start doing this thing in the store where, you know, buy the copy in the store and get some type of digital download thing, the free costume or something extra.
4091364	4092986	Maybe that's kind of where they're going.
4093346	4093726	We'll see.
4094727	4095448	Alright, moving on.
4095508	4096609	DarkSakura, what do you got for us?
4097888	4103471	Well, we have some news out of Japan, which is where the video games come from.
4103991	4105432	And it's a new Super Mario Bros.
4106232	4110634	Wii arcade cabinet that's being developed by Capcom.
4112338	4115159	Yeah, it's Super Mario Bros.
4115239	4116340	Wii Coin World.
4116680	4120321	It's a four-player game where you earn medals by participating in many games.
4120381	4123762	So kind of Mario Party-ish.
4124382	4124963	I say ish.
4127184	4128184	Not too much running and jumping.
4128984	4133366	And it actually is on Capcom of Japan's website.
4133426	4134926	There's a trailer and everything.
4136087	4136247	And...
4137688	4138989	I'm just like, why is Capcom doing it?
4139009	4145694	But then again, Capcom is... Nintendo hasn't ever really been much in the arcade scene except for the play choice.
4146314	4147435	Oh, that was years ago, though.
4147595	4149536	Arcades are not even the same thing now.
4149937	4154560	In fact, I more think this is newsworthy as, oh, arcade games are still popular somewhere in the world.
4155661	4161245	I think it's actually neat that they've got that relationship with Capcom to do it, because Capcom does put out good quality games.
4161900	4169007	Who did the Mario Kart sit-down driver game that said... Namco, because you can play as Pac-Man and Ms.
4169027	4169568	Pac-Man in that.
4169888	4170148	All right.
4170389	4170889	Yes, I thought.
4171069	4172311	So, yeah, Namco did that.
4172771	4174273	So, yeah, it's not totally unheard of.
4174533	4176054	That's a good example.
4176094	4179478	It's not totally unheard of that other companies might get to do Nintendo stuff in the arcade.
4180698	4187662	One of my favorite and most underrated arcade machines ever, F-Zero, which is a fucking amazing game.
4187962	4192524	Actually, the arcade machine's biggest problem was it only had six freaking tracks in it.
4192624	4193845	You could unlock them all at home.
4194225	4198187	There's one of the guys that's in the PlayStation hacking scene or whatever.
4198707	4199268	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4219229	4220250	It looks really cool.
4220610	4223271	I'll link the website to everyone in the chat room.
4223351	4225893	You know how that would make millions here in the U.S.?
4226973	4227354	Tickets.
4228874	4232356	I wonder if this will be part of New Super Mario Bros.
4232396	4234177	Wii DOS.
4235318	4235598	Maybe.
4236518	4237019	You never know.
4238499	4239660	Alright, let's move on.
4239760	4240380	Travel the world.
4240420	4245403	Look at some release dates of actual stuff coming to a store near you.
4245917	4253641	We're in April now, so now that we've passed the fiscal end of years for a lot of companies, there's not a lot of companies putting out stuff.
4253801	4255102	So here's what we've got.
4255262	4258684	Carnival Games, Monkey See, Monkey Do for the Xbox 360 and Kinect.
4259164	4260845	That's coming out this week.
4261365	4264247	Karaoke Revolution Glee Volume 2.
4265368	4265768	Coming out...
4266648	4268149	Game Only and with a mic.
4268689	4270390	Sorry, I just burped.
4272172	4276354	Remington Super Slam Hunting Alaska on the Wii.
4276394	4277715	Starring Sarah Palin.
4278175	4278715	Except not really.
4281317	4287161	And then on the 3DS a week from today, Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell 3D.
4288461	4293484	And I believe Raven Rabbit's Travel Through Time 3D is also coming out at that same time.
4295566	4295966	That's it.
4297338	4297638	Wow.
4297879	4299040	Yeah.
4299380	4299800	Short week.
4300541	4301281	Alright.
4301642	4303283	As will be much of April.
4303684	4305705	Well, SSA 100 Matt says needs more bacon.
4307066	4309248	Let's go to Japan real quick and look at the games coming out there.
4309288	4315213	We have Bullet Soul comes out in Japan this week on the Xbox 360 and Dragon Age Origins Awakening.
4315834	4322039	I imagine, you know, if it seems like they're behind a little bit, keep in mind they've got to translate that stuff into Japanese, so it is a little bit behind.
4322460	4324782	On the PlayStation 3 this week, Nada.
4325682	4329365	Going over to some other systems then, taking a look at the Wii.
4329905	4330945	Nothing there either.
4330986	4332827	In fact, not a lot on the horizon for the Wii.
4333107	4334468	How about the 3DS in Japan?
4334508	4338230	Well, you got a game called Cubic Ninja comes out this week in Japan.
4338350	4347375	It looks like you move little boxes that have ninja-looking graphics on them, and you, I don't know, move them around these stages and make them fall down holes.
4347756	4348656	It looks like a puzzle game.
4349297	4350077	It's a puzzle game.
4350357	4354500	It uses the tilt controls on the 3DS, and it is a 3DS game without 3D.
4355040	4356061	Earth Defense Force 2 Portable
4374517	4377078	Princess Frontier Portable Awesome!
4377639	4379700	And then a game called Are You Alice?
4379880	4381180	comes out this week on the PSP.
4381201	4382121	Hello, are you Alice?
4382901	4383242	No?
4383362	4383802	Okay.
4384022	4384622	Are you Alice?
4384882	4385203	No?
4386043	4386643	Are you Alice?
4386863	4388424	Regular and limited edition.
4388464	4391146	This looks to be, it's kind of like based off an anime it looks like.
4392046	4393367	Kind of like these chapters.
4393407	4396768	Looks like kind of like one of those interactive novel type things.
4396869	4398189	Because there's regular and limited edition.
4398249	4399230	It's a dating sim!
4399730	4400290	Is it really?
4400550	4401231	I think it is.
4401671	4402291	No.
4402531	4403412	This looks too like
4405325	4409287	If this is a dating sim, no, the woman would not have a sword in a dating sim.
4409387	4412669	I don't... It's got all that text.
4412990	4413690	Oh boy, alright.
4413810	4419493	And there's some pretty fun, funny hentai ones out there that involve swords and dragons and tentacles.
4420274	4423976	Coming next year from Quadratic Dream, Are You Jason?
4424837	4426237	The side story for Heavy Rain.
4426738	4427298	Are you Jason?
4427758	4427938	No?
4428279	4428519	Okay.
4429059	4429519	Are you Jason?
4430100	4430740	Have you seen Jason?
4431080	4431741	Do you know Jason?
4432121	4433762	That's it for Japanese release dates.
4434915	4438956	Well, in the UK, Jack and Squat, really.
4439216	4442457	On the 5th is Red Faction Battlegrounds for Xbox 360.
4443378	4446298	And the same thing a day later on the 6th for PlayStation 3.
4446678	4451620	And also, The Dishwasher Vampire Smile on Xbox 360.
4452060	4453080	What the crap is that?
4453541	4459802	Sounds like the sequel to The Dishwasher, the indie game that ended up being a real arcade release.
4460202	4461143	Oh, yeah.
4461223	4461803	Sounds like a sequel.
4463522	4467968	There's people in cages and a dude with a big sword.
4468568	4469810	That is a sequel to the game.
4470010	4470611	I would play that.
4471892	4472193	Alright.
4472633	4476358	Just a couple more stories for you guys in the classic game of the week.
4476438	4479181	And we have a pretty big one this week.
4479261	4480343	So we'll get to that in just a moment.
4480383	4481364	But first, Loki.
4481701	4482922	Katamari Amore and Katamari Amore Rolling Whopper
4500387	4500947	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4517621	4522625	Perhaps, but I guess Trip was one of the characters in Enslaved.
4523285	4525107	So maybe it's something to do with that.
4525167	4527889	Or maybe, heaven forbid, a new IP altogether.
4527909	4528929	I mean, I don't know.
4529650	4529970	Maybe.
4530471	4531731	Or it's another Katamari game.
4531792	4532112	Who knows?
4533368	4541793	Yeah, he left to make... Yeah, he made a pretty... The subtext was pretty clear that he was sick of the franchise after the second one and he just didn't care anymore.
4541813	4543273	Yeah, and they kept making them anyways.
4543414	4545054	Or I should say they kept rehashing them.
4545955	4547816	Oh, I'm still playing Nobi Nobi Boy.
4548076	4550097	Yeah, because that's what he did after Katamari.
4550797	4551358	It's actually fun.
4551398	4553078	People are still doing stuff on Nobi Nobi Boy.
4553779	4553979	Okay.
4554119	4557281	On the phone and uploading everything to Facebook so that girl will grow.
4557741	4557861	Hmm.
4560670	4582066	I hope if it's a new Katamari game it is like not part of this whole jump the shark that's kind of dominated this last generation of the games I'm sure we'll have a Katamari game that'll be in 3D that'll be basically the rehash levels again and it's gonna be on the 3DS I'm sure that's gonna happen eventually if it's in 3D I'll throw up because that's what they do whatever
4582606	4583007	I don't know.
4583047	4587691	I can't really get excited about this stuff because even I bought the last Konamaru game that was on 360.
4587951	4590554	It was just kind of... The 360 one was bad.
4590894	4592035	The PS3 one's alright.
4592335	4597820	The PS3 one's okay, but the problem with the PS3 one is that it's basically the same stuff from the first two games mixed together.
4598241	4598741	It's kind of like...
4599642	4603483	The Katamari game on the PS3 is like the Wilson Phillips Greatest Hits album.
4603943	4605964	They only fucking had two CDs, right?
4607164	4609825	So there's not a lot to compile a Greatest Hits album from.
4609865	4613346	Daft Punk has a Greatest Hits, and I think they only had, what, three albums?
4614147	4614367	Yeah.
4615387	4616527	Well, maybe that's not.
4616547	4617928	I guess it's kind of like that, then.
4618048	4618408	I don't know.
4620469	4624170	Surely you've seen those one-hit wonders that have these Greatest Hits CDs.
4624590	4628091	When I'm discovered and released an album, I'm just going to call it Greatest Hits.
4628803	4629203	Greatest Tits
4644698	4647680	Uh, moving on, one more story from me for this part of the show.
4647840	4649421	PlayStation Rewards.
4649721	4650222	Remember this?
4650582	4661208	It was a beta program that happened last year, and the beta is now ending, and this PlayStation Rewards program was supposed to be launching for all the PlayStation folks in the next month.
4662129	4668513	But I guess Sony has decided, based on what they've learned throughout the beta test, they do not want to roll this program out to the public yet.
4669033	4675776	So yeah, they're going to say, well, we thank loyal and devoted customers with innovative offerings, but yeah, it's not happening right now.
4676096	4679998	In fact, they're thinking it's been delayed indefinitely.
4680718	4686601	Now, the PlayStation Rewards program was supposed to have these quests and other things that go with it.
4686821	4687742	It was supposed to be quests.
4688242	4690203	Did you get real tangible stuff from this, I think?
4690643	4691644	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4712182	4718883	After careful consideration and evaluation following the PlayStation Rewards beta, we have decided not to roll out the program to the public at this time.
4719264	4729226	We remain committed to providing the best overall consumer experience for our users, and we will be refocusing our efforts in the near future to further developing PlayStation Plus and our other network services.
4729606	4733687	So maybe becoming a PlayStation Plus member is all the reward they want to give you.
4734467	4735707	That's what it sounds like anyway.
4736387	4738408	So, if you want rewards, you gotta pay for them.
4739028	4739608	They're like, wait...
4740268	4740888	DarkSakura.com
4768430	4769791	DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?
4769871	4770952	Alright, let's see what I can do here.
4771212	4773914	I think I have to fast forward a wee bit in this video to get to the dialogue.
4797307	4801268	There you go.
4806210	4808810	Wow, what a mansion.
4809090	4813652	I hope this is not Chris's blood.
4813852	4818173	Okay, it's Resident Evil.
4818813	4823034	And I actually did put up a sample of the redone dialogue in the GameCube version.
4823774	4824815	It's so much better.
4825295	4825895	So much better.
4827276	4828837	I can probably get to a little bit of that here.
4829737	4830918	What is this place?
4833319	4835780	Not quite your ordinary house, that's for sure.
4837581	4839182	Hey, Whisker, where's Chris?
4840263	4841563	I bought the GameCube... Jill, no!
4842564	4843845	You don't want to go back out there.
4845746	4848207	But we've got to find... What was that?
4850008	4850368	Chris?
4851068	4854410	Anyway... I hope this is not Chris's blood.
4855310	4856131	Master of Unlocking.
4857003	4859565	Maybe you, the master of unlocking, can use this.
4861287	4867932	So it was known as Biohazard in Japan, which actually, I've got a PlayStation version of Biohazard and have it on Saturn.
4869313	4876539	But this one is put out by Capcom, and it spawned a legacy still going on today.
4877360	4881924	It was developed by Shinji Mikami, and as of May 2009, it sold 40 million copies.
4884486	4888752	So this was one of the early ones into the survival horror series.
4893057	4894759	It had a full motion intro.
4896347	4897027	Thanks for watching!
4916342	4923451	So with this one, basically you are STARS member Jill Valentine or Chris Redfield.
4924433	4927217	And you are exploring this mansion and unlocking its secrets.
4928138	4929440	And Chris is helped by Claire.
4930201	4930641	Was it Claire?
4930661	4931182	Yeah, it was Claire.
4932043	4935085	and she was young and perky and emetic.
4935145	4935986	Rebecca, that was it.
4936026	4936886	Claire was his sister.
4937947	4938487	It was Rebecca.
4940448	4943270	And Barry helps Jill.
4944351	4945772	He also has the best line in the game.
4946652	4948253	You are almost a Jill sandwich.
4949514	4951835	And I hope this is not Chris's blood.
4952536	4954757	So yeah.
4955277	4958579	It was really, really ahead of its time when it came out.
4959920	4963541	and, um, there's actually, uh, other, uh, versions out.
4963601	4975685	They did the, um, I think it was called, uh, I'm trying to find the name of it because they did, um, a redone version of it that was, uh,
4978908	4980109	GameCube Better Dialogue
4996901	5022889	and uh but it was it's pretty much the original game just really really some of the story elements they added a little bit more references to the sequel and Code Veronica I think they fixed some of the continuity issues yeah but otherwise it was the same same game well and but even in like the very first one they had a reference to Ada who was in Resident Evil 2 and she was really cool
5024252	5028436	And it also has my favorite thing in here, is the diary.
5029256	5030538	Ugly face so ate him.
5031538	5031839	Itchy.
5032479	5032960	Tasty.
5033920	5035882	Yeah, so that's where itchy tasty comes from.
5037484	5040927	So, this one, I mean, it spawned all kinds of sequels.
5041087	5045551	You know, we had Code Veronica, we had Resident Evil 2 and 3 and 4 and 5.
5046712	5049094	Who remembers Dino Crisis?
5051511	5053533	DinoCrisis is actually pretty neat.
5053913	5060339	It actually just announced Resident Evil Revelations for the 3DS.
5061761	5065084	They've had Resident Evil Portable.
5065124	5066265	There's all kinds of versions out.
5066285	5067286	There's mobile games.
5067887	5070349	I even had this on the Game.com.
5071270	5072371	Let's report this to Wesker.
5072987	5083475	I'm reminded of a, um, I'm not sure if it was the Advance, but there was a Resident Evil novel guidance side story where it's Leon and Barry on a cruise ship, I think.
5083836	5084616	I think you were right.
5085057	5089660	Let me... I don't think it's canon, because that's some obscure stuff.
5089920	5093984	There were the Umbrella Chronicles, the Darkside Chronicles, Resident Evil Outbreak.
5096145	5097847	Um, it was a mobile one you said?
5098327	5098727	Or handheld?
5098747	5098908	Handheld.
5098928	5099288	Handheld.
5100731	5100971	Hmm.
5102031	5107573	There was Biohazard Eye Survivor and Resident Evil Assault the Nightmare.
5109113	5113334	You know, actually, one of my favorites in the series was Gun Survivor, which I got to play in the arcade.
5113354	5114534	You know, the Gun Con?
5114574	5116755	No, Gun Con was Namco.
5116835	5117495	The accessory.
5117855	5120456	Well, in Japan, you could play it with the gun.
5120696	5120876	Yeah.
5121536	5124397	But in the U.S., it... Oh, yeah, because you can't use those here.
5124777	5125397	They're taboo.
5126657	5153219	which I always thought it would have been perfect to do it on the Dreamcast but you couldn't play Gun Survivor you just navigated through but I thought that with the D-pad that was on the gun you should have been able to control with that although the arcade version was really cool because you walked by pressing forward with the gun and you could back up it was really fun but the first Gun Survivor one I think was Code Veronica or was it the second one?
5154520	5155361	I think that was the second one.
5156342	5157003	But that's the one I played.
5160006	5163710	There was also Resident Evil Operation Raccoon City that was another one.
5164751	5169957	It's supposed to be coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and on Windows.
5170498	5172320	And Resident Evil 6 is also coming out.
5174119	5175920	So yeah, all kinds of stuff going on.
5175980	5180141	And then there's movies, which the movies don't really have a lot to do with the game.
5180741	5181922	Not anymore, really.
5182822	5185083	Just a few things that are in common.
5185983	5188744	And there were all kinds of comics went out.
5188784	5191985	They did a Mantua, which the Code Veronica one was actually really good.
5192085	5192505	I liked it.
5193785	5194726	All kinds of cool stuff.
5195326	5196887	So yeah, Resident Evil.
5197207	5200248	Worst voice acting ever in the first one, but it's laughable.
5200428	5201168	It's fantastic.
5202064	5213175	I think Resident Evil of the 3D generation of consoles, the PlayStation 1, was the first game that really spawned an entirely new genre, which was survival horror.
5213295	5217018	We have Resident Evil to thank for Silent Hill and that whole franchise.
5217499	5220722	Although Silent Hill took a different turn in survival horror.
5221550	5228914	Well, yeah, but just the whole dark, you know, you against monsters, that whole scary thing, I think Resident Evil sort of laid down the foundation.
5229054	5229435	I don't know.
5229475	5234217	I always thought Friday the 13th on the Nintendo sponsor.
5234297	5235098	No way, no way.
5235138	5236058	It was Nightmare on Elm Street.
5238060	5242002	Or maybe it was the Metal Gear, I think, was always kind of...
5242389	5243510	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5259668	5260849	Alright, so is that it?
5260909	5261290	That's it?
5261510	5262050	That's it.
5262070	5264512	Classic game of the week, Resident Evil.
5264712	5266654	Oh, there's actually one more thing before I forget.
5266694	5267395	Make it quick.
5267595	5268075	Resident Evil 1.5.
5268296	5269236	Oh yeah.
5269937	5285871	That was a beta of Resident Evil 2 that had a different character named Elza Walker and Leon and she was like a motorcycle chick wearing the red and white leathers and they actually ended up scrapping it when it was about 60% done.
5287712	5311703	I'm trying to get my hands on one of those I think my N64 box the console system when the N64 first came out you know how they have on the side of the box the game like if you buy this console here are the games that are coming out I have one that has a Resident Evil 1.5 or 2 it was supposed to be Resident Evil 2 yeah that's on that and it never came out I guess for that system
5312341	5312882	DarkSakura,
5328641	5330122	We'll see what she picks next week.
5352950	5354773	So that could be very interesting.
5354793	5359239	We're going to talk about all that right after this when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5365962	5368744	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

5409832	5410713	Also pretty fun.
5411193	5413316	The Best Little Horde House in Azeroth.
5413396	5417862	It's a little side project Extifer and I have all about the world of Warcraft.
5418182	5420905	www.hordehouse.com for more information.
5420925	5422788	That's H-O-R-D-E-H-O-U-S-E.
5423549	5424830	Up to 20 episodes this week.
5424950	5425811	Woo!
5425952	5426552	We hit 30.
5426913	5427373	Nice.
5427514	5428074	You're old.
5428835	5430976	Oh wait, we're on 408 of this show.
5431056	5431557	I know, right?
5432577	5432857	Alright.
5433498	5438360	Quickly, gonna go to the rapid fire news and the tweets and all that stuff.
5438380	5452908	I wanted to ask us, let's just pop really quick though, speaking of Twitter and all that, some folks saw that you were doing a little bit of fundraising this week by selling off some of your video game collection, which I know is probably not an easy thing to do, but what were some of the stuff you sold this week and how did it do?
5454529	5462016	My most coveted title that I got rid of was Magic Knight Rayearth by Working Designs for the Sega Saturn.
5462056	5468341	It was the last game put out in the US for the Saturn months after the Saturn was already dead and buried.
5468421	5469322	They put this out.
5470163	5473025	Even more rare, I think, than Panzer Dragoon Saga, I want to say.
5473085	5475007	It's pretty... It's up there.
5475127	5477189	Although, Panzer Dragoon RPG...
5478970	5484253	was, I don't know, the two of them are pretty much rivals for hardest to find.
5484673	5491436	And so Rayearth was a top-down, basically it was a Legend of Zelda Link to the Past clone as far as visually how it looked.
5491996	5493097	It was a sort of RPG.
5494138	5497201	Anime cutscenes, it had the intro, the clamp anime.
5497401	5498182	Beautiful show.
5498363	5505591	They did such a good job with translating it, especially since they don't talk every time you touch something, like in a Japanese one.
5506072	5507293	It saved so much memory.
5507814	5508575	It was so much better.
5508795	5508975	Yeah.
5509856	5515541	So that went for... I've seen it go for over $100, but I got around $80 for it.
5515561	5516943	That's not too bad.
5517023	5517843	Yeah.
5517904	5518604	Great.
5518704	5519345	I never played it.
5519465	5521126	I opened it, loaded it, go, oh, neat.
5521687	5522288	Never touched it.
5523429	5523889	We've beaten it.
5524870	5529794	Bust a Move, not the puzzle bobble thing, but it was released in the U.S.
5529835	5530775	as Bust a Groove.
5530795	5531716	Yeah.
5533038	5535982	The soundtrack, I think, in the JP edition is a lot better.
5537284	5544234	Paper Mario 64, Ogre Battle 64, and a bunch of Saturn import stuff.
5544995	5547419	Darkstalkers, X-Men vs. Street Fighter.
5548680	5555464	And I'm going to have a round two of stuff going up next week, one of which will include the PS2 edition of Rez.
5555884	5556704	I'm getting rid of that.
5556984	5557204	Oh, wow.
5557284	5559005	Because I have it Rez HD on Xbox 360.
5559045	5560086	There you go.
5560526	5562627	And I think some DDR games you were going to get rid of too, right?
5563487	5571131	Yeah, I'm selling my PS1 third mix and best hits, which I think came out after fourth and before fifth.
5571151	5572032	Let me talk to you about Rez.
5572812	5572952	Okay.
5574079	5574359	All right.
5574599	5574779	Yeah.
5575079	5576020	So check that out.
5576140	5576720	That'll be up soon.
5577660	5581261	The reason, you know, I'm getting rid of these is because they're in great shape.
5581301	5595945	I know I'm never going to play them again, but actually having them in my hand, I wanted to hook my Saturn up to play some, you know, Vampire Savior, even though if it wasn't for me selling them, I never would have had the inkling to ever touch the game again, even though it's a great game.
5596685	5602210	It's just weird how you're attached to something, but you know you'd never play it unless you're confronted with getting rid of it.
5602410	5604532	It's just weird how nostalgia works.
5604872	5611919	That's kind of how our vault is, except we sometimes do get the wild hair to break out one of the systems and play it.
5612319	5618064	The whole reason we have so many systems is because nothing quite mimics having the controller in your hand.
5618344	5621367	You can play Vampire Savior with us.
5621707	5622428	I'll hook up to Saturn.
5623971	5624211	Number Porn
5642212	5643775	Yeah, there's some cool announcements.
5644175	5647861	Choplifter HD, it's a remake of the classic game.
5647881	5651446	It's supposed to be coming out on the PlayStation Network and PC this fall.
5652147	5655592	And based on some of the screenshots here...
5658630	5664834	Looks a little, I guess it looks pretty much like a classic game, just with the 3D, HD visuals.
5667296	5668016	Kind of cool looking.
5668537	5668857	I don't know.
5668937	5669798	Hopefully it turns out well.
5670618	5675241	And then another remake also in the works, Warlords.
5676042	5677983	The old Atari game is being remade.
5678383	5682406	That one's coming to Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network this summer.
5682426	5688290	You probably can expect that as part of the Summer of Gaming or whatever the hell they call it on the Xbox Live.
5689350	5708480	they're saying that it's gonna also I guess have the classic version as well as an evolved version I guess which was found or they had the evolved version which was in a previous Xbox Live Arcade release but this I guess is going to be something different I don't know
5709821	5710883	And then finally, Minecraft goes into beta 1.4.
5711063	5714748	And they added the wolves, cookies, and some other stuff.
5727445	5745938	um yeah tamable wolves cookies sleeping in a bed now resets your spawn position a new logo holding shift while climbing will hang on to the ladder spiders no longer trample crops and lots of lots and lots of infrastructure and statistic lists and achievements
5748707	5750189	Alright, neat.
5750569	5751830	Have you played Minecraft yet?
5751910	5752831	I still have not played Minecraft.
5752851	5753472	No, I have not either.
5753852	5758937	I watched a funny video today though of some girl's Minecraft house and she was just really funny.
5759417	5763741	It's like, oh my god, there's like 400 pounds of bacon right here and there were like pigs everywhere in front of her house.
5764482	5765002	It was really funny.
5765183	5765343	Nice.
5766868	5769569	I haven't played Minecraft, but yet I've played SingStar.
5769910	5774453	And SingStar is adding 40 new songs to the store, or did add 40 new songs to the store this week.
5774833	5783138	Now you can sing along with such karaoke classics as Cryin' by Aerosmith, Who Let the Dogs Out by the Baja Men, Crocodile Rock by Elton John.
5784139	5784539	Let's see.
5785560	5787722	I'm Good, I'm Gone by Leaky Lee.
5787922	5788562	Likey Lee?
5788742	5790003	I don't even know how to say her name.
5790043	5790663	Likey Lie.
5791104	5792465	She's crazier than Bjerk.
5792905	5795827	I don't know how you would sing along to that, but you can now.
5796427	5806211	Grace Kelly by Mika, a bunch of songs by the band Razorlight, and oh, just for Salacious Pop, I know you love the Pussycat Dolls, so you can do Hush Hush now on SingStar.
5808432	5814494	Also some dance add-ons have been sold as well, and then most interesting in a way, classical song packs.
5815015	5824959	I'm not sure how exactly you sing to the, I guess maybe it's old opera style, I don't know, but you can do Oh Sole Mio by DiCapua, Mozart with Queen of the Night Aria,
5825959	5828040	La Donna Immobile by Verdi.
5828680	5831941	I don't know why, but yeah, now classic songs are available.
5832161	5833481	I knew high school singers.
5834142	5836422	That's a series that's like Buku Crazy in Europe, right?
5836742	5838603	Yeah, it's pretty big over there.
5838823	5840764	And they're okay games here.
5840864	5844165	I mean, they had like the SingStar Queen and the SingStar Abba.
5844425	5850967	You know, probably the biggest thing about this is that the actual music videos, if available, play behind the song when you're singing it.
5850987	5851547	So that's pretty cool.
5851987	5854428	Can't wait to see the music video for the Mozart stuff.
5854688	5856629	I know, I'm kind of wondering how that's going to work.
5856669	5859069	I guess they have some generic video in the background there.
5859109	5859469	I don't know.
5860089	5863990	Well, some more information following, unfortunately, the tragedy in Japan.
5864230	5868251	It has some folks asking a little bit forward, what's going to happen to Tokyo Game Show 2011?
5868391	5875713	Well, now, there's no plans to cancel the Tokyo Game Show just yet, but they are saying it could happen in a reduced state.
5876113	5879634	This is in an interview that the Tokyo Game Show officials did with Kotaku.
5880274	5882795	They didn't say anything yet, but they did say, quote,
5883095	5888080	Depending on the situation from here on out, it's possible that the show is reduced.
5888540	5890803	The show is scheduled to take place in September.
5891503	5896728	I'm sure it'll still be a pretty big thing and they haven't said, oh, it's closed off to the public or any of that yet.
5897469	5903555	But they are treading a little bit carefully with a lot of uncertainty still happening in the world after the show.
5903895	5904556	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5922854	5927680	and Akira Yamaoka, who of course was one of the minds behind Silent Hill and so forth.
5927740	5930423	He is doing a benefit album for Tsunami survivors.
5930463	5937111	It's called Play for Japan, kind of a play on words of the Pray for Japan Twitter hashtag that was going on at the time.
5937611	5939432	BattleStarGalactica BattleStarGalactica BattleStarGalactica
5956258	5958439	God, that had a great soundtrack, that show.
5958899	5960940	And Woody Jackson, who did Red Dead Redemption.
5961020	5965082	So some Western influence as well as from Japan.
5965422	5966462	So that's pretty awesome.
5967002	5972565	Kiriyamaoka also posted a letter at playforjapan.org, available in several languages.
5972745	5973405	So that's pretty cool.
5973445	5976247	It's supposed to come out in May 2011 on iTunes.
5976787	5981869	So you don't even have to leave the house to do your little bit to help support the Japanese relief.
5981909	5982870	I think that's a great idea.
5983730	5984490	Alright, let's move on.
5985111	5985611	DarkSakura.
5987011	5991753	Well, we have some Street Fighter news actually coming out of the UK.
5992613	6000576	There was registered for the BBFC for Super Street Fighter 4 Arcade Edition to be coming out in June.
6001557	6006519	That's the British Board of Film Classification, which also is in charge of video games for some reason.
6007459	6008379	Why can't they do that here?
6008960	6009200	Anyway.
6010901	6019891	Um... Capcom hasn't necessarily confirmed, but there's putting out that there's a... Um... That it could be download content.
6021173	6022194	Or you can buy an expansion.
6022234	6023375	They're still speculating.
6023575	6023676	So...
6025137	6025877	Music Unlimited
6056781	6057442	from what it looks like.
6057862	6063306	But like a legal way of doing it instead of like, you know, LimeWire or whatever the kids use these days.
6063366	6064006	Bit torn, I guess.
6064286	6064526	Yeah.
6065507	6070490	And then in Rock Band 3 news, we have Joy Division download content, which I like Joy Division.
6070871	6071631	But not just them.
6071671	6075294	We have Grand Funk Railroad, The Locomotion, and we're an American band.
6075974	6079276	And J. Giles Band Freeze Frame and Joy Division Love Will Tear Us Apart.
6081218	6081598	That's it.
6082074	6087299	Alright, let's go to the Twitter, but first I want to read a comment here from our chatroom at chat.orangelaunchradio.com.
6088020	6092945	Kassen in our chatroom says, I do not want the MPAA in charge of video game ratings.
6093085	6094266	Those guys are idiots.
6095187	6096588	Yeah, actually that's a really good point.
6096608	6097489	Those guys are idiots.
6098350	6100372	The way they rate some of those movies is unbelievable.
6100885	6101725	Let's go to the Twitter!
6118479	6121702	Twitter.com slash OLR is where you can send us tweets every week.
6122483	6124925	We read your tweets here on the show and we'll respond to them.
6125405	6132392	Fun ET Man sent us a tweet saying, I wonder if you will talk about this and sent us to an article on thelostlevels.org.
6132692	6137737	This is a website that likes to kind of find old prototypes and things that have changed in games.
6138057	6140139	They've done some stories on Zelda or whatever.
6140459	6143482	Well, this article happens to be on the game Bio Force Ape.
6144763	6149305	and I guess this is a game that was kind of recently finally dumped into a ROM.
6149625	6150225	Here's the deal.
6150245	6151646	This game never actually came out.
6151786	6154587	It was teased in Nintendo Power in the early 90s.
6154627	6155687	It was an NES game.
6156187	6165271	And in this game, you take control of Bioforce Ape, a genetically altered super chimpanzee as he tries to make his way through a high-tech maze to rescue his adopted human family.
6165311	6165551	What?
6165931	6166451	Yeah, right?
6167392	6174377	Apparently, one of the best parts of the game is when Bioforce 8 takes a wild, out-of-control ride on one of the speeding platforms, or coal cars.
6175098	6177059	Animation is humorous, and so on and so on.
6177559	6179941	And, yeah, so I guess there was this whole debacle.
6180341	6189148	Somebody had the game, it came out in 2005 that the game was out there, and that there was photographic evidence taken, and I guess...
6189908	6192791	Obviously, the thing had bugs in it and so forth.
6193933	6199158	The guy was urged to sell the prototype, but he was really scared about the ROM getting out there.
6200599	6206085	More stuff came out, including this humorous punching of a slime-looking thing that says, Eat Communism.
6206105	6207386	It's like a monkey made out of butter.
6207447	6207907	What is that?
6207987	6208728	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6228815	6229976	Thanks for watching!
6250286	6250907	Go, monkey, go!
6274986	6276627	and teleporters and traps.
6277187	6279048	So now you get teleporters in the game.
6279408	6282049	Of course, Snake360 had the four-player battles.
6282129	6283270	It was very multiplayer.
6283510	6286891	They really should just let him put it out on Xbox Live.
6286931	6290013	It would be really cool if you could actually play it through the interwebs.
6290233	6290493	DarkSakura.com
6310813	6312574	Spazinator tweets us a story.
6312634	6313754	It's a Sony story here.
6313774	6314695	Let me see what this is all about.
6314715	6315315	I got to load this.
6316535	6317196	It's not loading.
6317256	6317876	God damn it.
6317896	6318916	He's trying to Rick Roll us.
6318976	6319837	You little bastard.
6320477	6321618	I cut it off before he could.
6321778	6322258	Was that real?
6323078	6323819	Yeah, it started to come up.
6323839	6324519	It said Rick Astley.
6324559	6325319	I'm like, nope.
6326100	6326320	Nope.
6326440	6326980	Done with that.
6327741	6329561	So congratulations, Spazinator.
6329621	6332223	You have banned yourself from Twitter for one whole month.
6332303	6334724	We will not be reading your tweets for one whole month.
6335609	6335909	Burnout Crash
6349576	6373269	Burnout Crash is coming to the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3 I guess EA hasn't announced a new Burnout game But Australia actually released a classification for Burnout Crash And I guess surfing some LinkedIn profiles it's found out that this is happening It's an Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 title No official announcement yet It seems logical there would be another Burnout game at some point
6373829	6395173	hopefully it's a little more like the older games like I know the Burnout Paradise or whatever was really well supported but you know that franchise still sells really well right as far as I know yeah Paradise was awesome yeah so alright I mean come on you gotta love it's like oh any moment I wanna go in the crash mode okay crash mode it was awesome
6395660	6398344	American's Average 13 Minutes Playing Video Games on TV Daily
6410800	6411861	Only 13 minutes?
6412681	6416883	I think that's the people who play for four hours at a time, balancing out those that don't play at all.
6417384	6418224	I don't know how that works.
6418284	6423247	But yeah, adults spend an average of 13 minutes a day using a TV to play video games.
6423287	6426248	That's from Nielsen's State of the Media, U.S.
6426368	6428149	TV Trends by Ethnicity.
6428830	6429110	I guess...
6429810	6430470	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6456625	6459149	Ironically enough, though, you have to admit this is a little bit ironic.
6459209	6467439	According to their little graph here, the smallest ethnicity, or I should say the smallest play time by any ethnicity, nine minutes, Asians.
6468441	6468721	Who knew?
6470303	6470664	There you go.
6472466	6473788	Because they have the tiger mom.
6474864	6475865	I guess, I don't know.
6476185	6476565	All right.
6477306	6478127	Let's move on.
6478587	6480429	Something a little less racial, please.
6480449	6480789	Loki.
6480809	6482110	A little less racial?
6483271	6483911	All right, fine.
6484472	6487714	No, so we're going to talk a little bit about the 3DS.
6487775	6490657	Obviously, 3DS probably did pretty well.
6490777	6491898	I mean, I'd assume.
6492498	6498083	Nintendo's saying it's the best first day handheld sales launch ever.
6498924	6499264	So...
6500865	6501605	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6520052	6522073	So, good for them, I suppose.
6523734	6526676	Unfortunately, though, it wasn't without problems.
6526856	6530839	There are some issues with the 3DS, including some crashes.
6530919	6540105	Apparently, people have been running into some software crashes that require the system to be shut off and then turned back on to get it playing right.
6540505	6548371	Apparently, this was fixed in the latest firmware, the one you download to get your little 3D video from OK Go.
6549711	6578418	so that's kind of cool at least that's been fixed however something that's not really going to be able to be fixed within some sort of patching system is the fact that the hinges once again are loose or at least some people are reporting loose hinges which require you to actually send your system back in to get it repaired what a slut that 3DS must be totally loose I heard I haven't had that problem with loose hinge yet but I know it was something that plagued a lot of systems before especially on the DS Lite kind of sucks
6580373	6582274	But thankfully, not a problem for me
6604825	6605386	Lawsuit.
6605986	6607468	Somebody is suing EA.
6608269	6609610	There might be some weight to this one, though.
6609630	6613153	It's not one of those class action lawsuits or somebody mad about something a little frivolous.
6613173	6614855	This could have some actual weight to it.
6615976	6617938	You know the game John Madden Football?
6618018	6622882	Well, you ought to, because this is the series that became Madden NFL, like what, 07, 08, 09, 11, 10, every year.
6622902	6623323	Annual sequel.
6625745	6626465	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6653251	6655132	But it's not like totally freaking gray.
6655192	6657633	So, you know, this is a long old game.
6658153	6674320	Well, my point with this here is that Robin Antonik, who created the very first game and you see his name there in the programming there in Madden, apparently 23 years after this very first game, he is not seeing any revenue from it.
6674760	6685905	Now, he has filed suit against Electronic Arts for tens of millions in royalties, and apparently he was responsible for the development of virtually all the groundbreaking technology at the heart of the game.
6686225	6688186	That's at least what he claims in his suit.
6688886	6696549	EA has not paid this guy any royalties since 1992 was the last time he got royalties.
6697350	6697810	Interesting.
6698630	6700491	I mean, he did make the original game.
6700651	6701852	It was kind of his baby.
6702552	6705354	I mean, I'm sure the game has changed many times since then.
6705734	6709496	Something you may not know, John Madden Football did not have actual NFL teams.
6709536	6711217	They didn't have the NFL license at the time.
6711758	6713058	EA got that years later.
6713519	6717601	So, you know, you could say the game's changed a whole fuckton since the beginning.
6717881	6719422	So maybe this guy doesn't deserve anything.
6719822	6724064	Well, yeah, I mean, it's John Madden's namesake that's the brand.
6724645	6726226	You know, the actual announcer guy.
6727326	6748596	but this person Robin sounds like he might have signed a bad contract when they took the license from him where he was paid up front for the concept of what it is but I'd have to read more about what the actual the complaint that was filed in court I would need to read that to know how reasonable this is
6749096	6752478	Yeah, but so it's going to be interesting.
6752538	6755880	I mean, especially with such a huge franchise to see kind of what happens with this.
6755900	6764786	But, you know, a lot of times, especially back in the day, I mean, back in the 80s, you know, this was always a huge thing where programmers really weren't getting the credit they deserved.
6764826	6767908	I mean, that was why Activision was kind of formed in the first place.
6768428	6773012	It was a bunch of people really upset that programmers didn't get more credit in Atari games.
6773432	6778996	The very first Easter egg in a video game was where the dude's initials were in Adventure.
6779457	6784861	That was so that the guy could kind of sneak his credit in there because Atari never credited their programmers and game designers.
6785161	6788003	But Activision, remember the names like David Crane and so forth?
6788023	6790105	These guys would make the games and get to put their names on them.
6790405	6793928	Because a lot of these Atari games were by one guy or two guys.
6794708	6795449	And they're cool guys.
6824768	6832854	so bad it's like the worst port ever but it's so funny because you play the old school Pac-Man on the 2600 and it really is garbage but then they had a Ms.
6832894	6833515	Pac-Man later Ms.
6833535	6839179	Pac-Man was great for an Atari game it was great well the reason why is because the Ms.
6839199	6852829	Pac-Man was on like a 4K cart whereas the Pac-Man was on like half that maybe a quarter of that I don't know so like the whole like drawing one ghost every frame why the ghost flickered so terribly that was a restriction of the cartridge I mean think about it
6853610	6858151	Those programmers had 2K to design an entire game.
6858852	6860452	2K is how long an essay is.
6860832	6861573	It's crazy.
6863673	6863953	Anyhow.
6866814	6869235	Boy, we sure get into classic gaming discussion a lot on this show.
6869275	6869715	It's pretty good.
6869915	6871016	It's because we loves it.
6871136	6871396	We do.
6871996	6872596	And we're old.
6874637	6875257	DarkSakura?
6875897	6876197	We?
6876637	6877418	What do you mean we?
6877698	6877998	I'm sorry.
6878038	6879138	Especially DarkSakura.
6879198	6879498	Hey!
6880559	6881919	Don't make me break out the Vuvuzela.
6883376	6884857	How about I break out another news story?
6885217	6893384	Well, Monolith Soft's putting out a Wii RPG, Xenoblade, and it's being localized for Europe.
6894104	6894785	Yay.
6897146	6899848	It's actually going up for Xenoblade Chronicles.
6900849	6927511	that although the trailer itself is untranslated it shows basically all of the imagery going out Nintendo of Europe put out a press release and then removed it but somebody actually managed to get it out and get the information out and it's supposed to have English and Japanese voice options so maybe we'll get it here too
6928055	6934185	I'm assuming if they're going to spend the time to translate into English that they're going to release it in more than one region.
6934205	6938311	But what if there's like an elevator in the game and they call it a lift?
6938612	6939473	Americans might not understand.
6939493	6941636	Oh my god, where will they find that?
6941777	6942778	One employee do type...
6943399	6944240	and Elevator.
6944840	6945440	Woo!
6945480	6947221	That was a day's work there.
6947381	6955406	What if somebody in the game, maybe there's a smoking scene and the guy says he's going to go out and have a fag and that could never go over here in the U.S.
6955486	6957087	because, like, you know, glad will sue.
6957267	6961930	Once again, you know, that same employee on day two could easily type cigarette.
6962846	6963846	This looks pretty good, though.
6964086	6969368	Or maybe they're going to go out and have a crumpet and people will be like, they don't know what the fuck that is over in the United States.
6969428	6970508	Pants versus trousers.
6970648	6972048	People will just burst into tears.
6972808	6974729	My favorite one is the word fanny.
6976449	6977570	It's not just a pack anymore.
6978090	6978250	No.
6978690	6979790	Fanny here is your butt.
6980070	6980830	There's the vag.
6981831	6982251	Oh, my.
6982691	6984491	Is that why a fanny pack is really in the front?
6986172	6987272	A friend of mine explained that to me.
6987332	6987572	Of course.
6987932	6990773	Well, you know why I always giggle when I pass the catering place?
6990793	6991873	Because it's called Randy Peter's.
6992540	7001026	All EA has to do is prove that his code was not used after 1992, or that the contract with them was only valid until 1992.
7001086	7001147	Hmm.
7020541	7024384	Spazinator says, yet Activision no longer gives credits and manuals anymore.
7024584	7025405	Oh, the irony.
7025885	7028867	And DarkToagak follows that up with, what the fuck is a game manual?
7030448	7031909	I thought they did have credits and game manuals.
7031929	7033130	They were just like all the way in the back.
7033210	7037994	They do, and then EA doesn't have manuals anymore, from what I remember.
7038234	7038494	Really?
7038614	7039214	They're all digital now.
7039234	7039975	It's all online now?
7040055	7040716	Digital manuals?
7040916	7041836	It's all on the disc.
7042177	7043938	I think you just have to make the information available.
7045359	7046800	This game looks super pretty, by the way.
7047604	7048025	Xenoblade
7070405	7073907	Yeah, except that, you know, Sony decided, hey, you know what?
7074147	7079431	We got this PlayStation phone coming out, so let's get it removed.
7079591	7087196	So, PSX4Droid was removed from the Android marketplace without warning due to a content policy violation.
7088977	7091858	He's, I guess, saying, you know, what the hell?
7091898	7095881	He figured it was from the, you know, Xperia Play coming out.
7096141	7096901	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
7122877	7131383	And the initial offerings, of course, were Cool Boarders 2, Destruction Derby, Jumping Flash, Medieval 2, and Syphon Filter.
7132324	7135526	And all those are available for $6, or €3.99.
7137788	7142091	And I guess it's the same price that they're going on the PlayStation Network right now.
7145333	7146875	It is kind of funny, though.
7146895	7148075	I guess they're saying that...
7151027	7151387	I don't know.
7152248	7157414	I would think... I thought the marketplace for Android was open.
7157454	7167665	I mean, if you can't get your app on the Android marketplace, I mean, there's other marketplaces out there where you can, I don't know, upload it somewhere else and someone can download it from that website.
7167825	7168746	Am I correct, I think?
7169486	7173691	Because I know they have the Amazon marketplace now, and obviously that's not on the Android marketplace.
7176443	7178024	I don't know, iPhones all different.
7178305	7179526	Yeah, everyone in here has an iPhone.
7179546	7180726	Yeah, I know, so sorry.
7180907	7182968	Don't mean to be ignorant, but it's how it is.
7183649	7200242	Well, I mean, that sucks, I guess, but it makes sense because obviously if there's a free PlayStation or even a PlayStation that you can buy and then download the ROMs for, that would kind of defeat the point of having to buy all these different games.
7200902	7201022	And...
7202344	7212759	If it is anything like a normal Android phone, if people really want to, since it is legal to jailbreak your phone, you could jailbreak or root your phone and download this anyways.
7214001	7216324	Really, why play a PlayStation game on your phone?
7216785	7216985	You know?
7217745	7220726	Why buy a phone that's meant for playing PlayStation games?
7236951	7245037	And I think of like, how in the fuck are you supposed to play a PlayStation game with that type of setup?
7245057	7248819	But then I forget, oh yeah, these Xperia Plays and stuff, they actually have buttons.
7248839	7250600	They're like PSPs, but they actually work as phones.
7250620	7252021	So that makes a lot more sense to me.
7267212	7267613	I don't know.
7267673	7270717	I mean, it's not like this thing plays PSP games.
7271157	7272579	It plays PlayStation 1 games.
7272679	7273400	I mean, really?
7274242	7276304	Your PSP will play PlayStation 1 games, too.
7276344	7276865	Exactly.
7276925	7282653	I mean, if you really want something to play PlayStation 1 games on, seriously, go find a Generation 1 PSP.
7284455	7286956	Oh my god, that would probably be pretty dirt cheap.
7287456	7296599	Or go to a farmer's market auction thing that has the, you know, I'm thinking like Denio is here locally, but they have PlayStations everywhere.
7296659	7298520	There are PSPs everywhere.
7299260	7300701	Even an actual PlayStation 1's.
7302214	7308616	I wouldn't... Yeah, PlayStation 1's... On the go, PlayStation 1's not very portable.
7308997	7315879	I mean, you could technically do it with a battery pack and stuff, but it's... I seem to remember some little screen you could plug in the back of the base.
7315899	7316639	They have the screen.
7316679	7319961	They do have the screen, and they're used for hacking stuff quite a bit.
7320641	7326043	They're definitely used for portable consoles more than the actual PlayStation 1, but...
7326543	7330947	I mean, seriously, you just buy a PSP and just play your PlayStation 1 games on there if you really want to do it.
7330987	7334990	And that way you don't get locked into a contract and you don't need to buy this expensive phone for it.
7335010	7337532	But people like gaming on the phone.
7338773	7340234	Here's my thing.
7340414	7344277	It's good that they have these buttons, but are all the developers really using it?
7344617	7345398	No, they are not.
7345578	7355846	So don't expect to buy this and go all of a sudden, oh, hey, now I can play Mega Man 2 or something like that really easily using the buttons because you're not going to be able to.
7357287	7357648	I don't know.
7357748	7359350	It's whatever.
7359410	7363114	I mean, if you want to do this, this is something for you.
7363174	7364877	Just, you know, know it's out there now.
7365377	7369242	Misty in our chat room says, speaking of iPhones, someone needs to get theirs away from a mic.
7369562	7369863	Jamie?
7371445	7372666	I'm dealing something with Dan.
7373127	7374789	Oh, well, still, it's... I moved it.
7374829	7375429	Look, it's over here.
7378504	7386612	And you know, whenever anybody hears that do-do-do tone, like everybody looks at their iPhone, any iPhone owner, whenever that, there's some commercial on the radio that uses that tone, and it's terrible.
7386652	7394539	I don't do that because my volume on my iPod is turned off, and also my iPod is turned off, like a normal person would.
7396021	7397622	You iPhone people, crazy.
7398720	7401784	Well, maybe my mommy needs to contact me in an emergency.
7402785	7403286	She would text me.
7403306	7406230	My husband's two states away, so I'm trying to keep in touch with him.
7406390	7407151	No, I understand that.
7407171	7408833	That's no problem, but I'm just saying, you know.
7411946	7412767	I don't know what you're saying.
7429776	7430577	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7450959	7457208	It's just that they just bank on people are going to stop caring after seven or eight years or whatever the abandonware sites say.
7457569	7464699	Well, I guess these sites were hosting Ultima 4 and sites have been giving away that game since like the late 90s.
7465080	7466281	This game dates all the way back to 1985.
7467463	7467884	and DarkSakura.
7483823	7484544	All new MMOs from EA
7499483	7528864	so could it be that EA is trying to protect this old IP all of a sudden because they're about to announce a new Ultima MMO at E3 who knows so of course as brought up earlier in the show Ultima Online has been out since 1997 and so it is a 14 year old game so maybe it's going to get an update and that could also explain this whole loyalty program thing coming out of the blue it seems like you know like maybe like a last hurrah for Ultima Online before they're about to announce something big at E3 who knows
7529364	7538988	And the last time that we heard something about this happening was the Sarian games that had all the Space Quest and King's Quest for Sierra Online available to play.
7539028	7543990	And then the fan, the fandom game, I'm blanking on the name.
7544170	7544671	Silver Lining.
7544731	7545311	Silver Lining.
7545631	7552354	They got a C and D and we thought, oh, it's just, you know, the Activision being horrible, but it looked like, no, the Telltale or not.
7552974	7581260	yeah Telltale's yeah Telltale got the King's Quest revamp license and it's like oh well maybe they weren't just being total assholes there's actually a relevant reason for them to do those CNDs this because that happened just one or two months ago that gives me reason to believe this Ultima story has can hold water very good point yeah all right well we'll see what happens I think E3 will be very telling this could be one of the big things they announced uh would there be interest in Ultima C Ultima was that was a big Richard Garriott thing too remember that was like his baby
7583681	7588444	I didn't actually own my own gaming PC or a PC period until like 95, 96.
7589784	7595948	So all the Ultima stuff that came before, personally, I missed out on all of the Ultima stuff during the 80s.
7596208	7598609	See, I owned 3 and 4 on the NES.
7598809	7600690	I owned both of them on the NES, and they were great games.
7601190	7602651	Well, they were really hardcore.
7603011	7604692	They were not like Final Fantasy.
7604712	7605913	They were pretty in-depth.
7606093	7607634	I think 3 had an amazing soundtrack, too.
7607654	7609835	Weren't they off a model of just Dungeons & Dragons?
7609855	7611256	Which was Ultima Exodus?
7612036	7612997	Um, was three.
7613717	7614918	Yeah, because I tried playing that one.
7615238	7616639	I had it on NES.
7616799	7618620	Yeah, with the two moons that were always in the corner.
7618640	7621142	It could be like the Cleric or the Druid.
7621162	7622463	There was like a million classes in it.
7622923	7623844	Yeah, that was Ultima.
7623864	7626325	And then there was Ultima Quest of the Avatar, which was a little more.
7626646	7629808	But see, those games are really not like their PC counterparts.
7629908	7633590	They were really, I don't want to say dumbed down, but they were really changed for the NES.
7633630	7634791	Mine ended up under a lawnmower.
7636512	7637032	Not my fault.
7637232	7637653	Wow.
7638953	7639494	Poor game.
7639514	7639814	Yeah.
7640475	7641116	DarkSakura.com
7652930	7657492	There was one big one that 7, 8, or 9, I don't know, had a lot of hype to it.
7657712	7659853	Yeah, so, well, they all had some hype to them.
7659873	7661534	But now Richard Garriott's long gone, you know?
7661634	7667016	Well, I mean, he's not, like, dead or anything, but he went off and did Tabula Rasa, which tanked, unfortunately, for him.
7667336	7668757	That was the whole space MMO.
7668797	7671598	That was an NCSoft free... It was not free.
7671618	7672218	It was never free.
7672618	7675139	It was an NCSoft pay game that just never took off.
7675179	7675800	I played it once.
7676300	7678781	It was all right, but it was more like a shooter-type game.
7679341	7680781	And yeah, that didn't go over so well.
7681282	7684923	Well, maybe after that whole debacle failed, maybe he's coming back and doing this.
7684983	7685343	Who knows?
7686303	7687303	Could be a variety of things.
7687963	7689264	Alright, let's get to the mailbag.
7689324	7700107	Every week we invite your emails at mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com And DarkSakura's gonna dive into the email bag headfirst and pull out a couple emails that she thinks are worth sharing with us tonight.
7701044	7702165	I found some sticky ones.
7720843	7721103	Robert M.
7737532	7739233	No, I think you have a right to question those types of emails.
7739293	7746038	Exactly, and also I don't think that they are actually having you agree to those terms of services through that.
7746218	7748120	I got an email, I think.
7748260	7750041	I just ignored it because I don't care.
7750061	7756886	I did get an email, but the minute I went back into the PS3, I played PS3 just a couple days ago, I think after the first, because that's when we were playing Mortal Kombat.
7756906	7757567	It was Friday, right?
7757627	7757747	Yeah.
7757987	7760750	and it made me re-accept the turns of service when I signed in.
7761111	7763433	So that'll all happen through your PlayStation.
7763874	7765255	So don't do anything with email.
7765315	7769620	I was watching Supernatural on Friday night and it didn't have me do anything.
7772085	7773866	Maybe you weren't connecting to the interwebs?
7773946	7774346	IDK.
7775106	7775466	Might be.
7776526	7778227	Okay, next email.
7780348	7784549	Note, the following letter has been mirrored posted to the Sims 3 online forums.
7785089	7789131	And this is also titled, by the way, A Satirical Response to the Dragon Age 2 Protest Letter.
7790411	7794373	Dear sirs, in the past week I've been playing a lot of the game The Sims 3 on my iPad.
7794854	7798076	I like most of the game, however there is one element of the game that absolutely offends me.
7798636	7804439	In the game you can make different meals for yourself and whoever you happen to be living with at the point in the game.
7805020	7808482	Among the meal options you can choose from is vegetable soup.
7809022	7810583	This option deeply offends me.
7810823	7813144	As an ardent carnivore, I eat meat with every meal.
7813444	7813745	Every!
7814205	7818607	I eat meat with breakfast, meat with lunch, meat with afternoon snack, meat with dinner, meat with my late night snack.
7819008	7823150	I eat meat like it's going out of style, which, after going to my local Whole Foods, it just might be.
7823810	7830174	The option of eating vegetable soup offends me as I feel meat should be not only an option of what to eat at meals, it should be THE option.
7830914	7831495	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
7849813	7854094	I will post an online petition that will surely be signed by many of the gamers who identify and agree with me.
7854575	7855875	Online petitions are no joke.
7856155	7858316	Think of all the things that have changed because of online petitions.
7858476	7858976	Think of it.
7859076	7860176	Yours truly, Red Entertainment.
7860356	7860957	Satire over.
7861557	7864238	This message has been brought to you by the tachymeter.
7865638	7869819	That collection of numbers on the outside of your watch... Oh, tachometer.
7870620	7875101	That collection of numbers on the outside of your watch that you have no idea what the fuck it's there for.
7875861	7877322	Tachometers on your car...
7879008	7880369	To show you your RPMs, right?
7883191	7885873	So, yeah, I thought the parody, though, was pretty funny.
7885953	7887715	I mean, it's pretty right on.
7887895	7888295	I lulled.
7888435	7893479	So, what's the name of the guy from Bioware that did that old, the David... David something.
7893499	7893900	Spader?
7894420	7895361	No, that's an actor.
7895621	7896161	Yeah, he's an actor.
7896181	7897863	Well, that's David Spade, but it's Gator.
7899664	7909954	There's an online petition to get him fired because I guess the same-sex options, the NPCs in Dragon Age 2, whether it be the female, what's her name?
7910194	7910535	Meryl?
7911936	7913938	The elf girl Meryl, yeah.
7914321	7916664	I think Meryl will hit on you no matter what gender you are.
7933664	7939189	Okay, but just... And so will, I think it's Varric, the dwarf guy?
7939709	7944533	Yeah, I think they're just set to be attracted to the main person.
7944773	7955402	Yeah, but I just thought it was funny that he had put out that response to that one idiot guy who wrote in, but there's also just a petition to get him fired because I guess the gay and lesbian characters are horny.
7955842	7957923	That's butt-tarded.
7958063	7959423	If anyone's horny, it's Isabella.
7959703	7960183	I found it.
7961124	7961844	Here's the petition.
7961904	7963604	It's on PetitionSpot.com.
7963684	7965165	Please don't visit it.
7965185	7967725	It says, Fire David Gator for stereotyping gays.
7968366	7973287	As a homosexual playing Dragon Age 2, I've witnessed the worst stereotype homosexual characters in this game.
7973747	7979529	If you refuse to make your moves on a gay character, then you are received rivalry points for not wanting to be gay for the character.
7980049	7980990	This is completely wrong.
7981030	7983491	Homosexuals do not approach people and force them to kiss us.
8000200	8008971	This is the type of garbage that has people believe gays shouldn't serve in the military.
8009272	8012235	We are human beings that are the same as everyone else.
8012556	8017101	Please sign this petition if you wish that Dragon Age senior writer David Gator should be fired.
8017662	8041188	and this is by the user Oakland how about fuck you because get this if okay if all right say we have I'm just gonna use Meryl for example and she's hitting on my female rogue but in the male scenario she hits on the male rogue too and you reject her is that going to make her like you anymore is it gonna make her a little bit upset with you it doesn't matter gender she's still hitting on whoever
8042759	8053045	Alright, so we would like to give a big hearty OLR fuck you to the following people who have signed this petition and posted their names publicly on the internet for us all to see.
8053305	8055747	After all, it was your choice to sign this in a public forum.
8056267	8061891	So we'd like to give a good hearty fuck you to Ryan Cukor, John Holmes,
8062851	8070239	Ryan Guerrero, John Jamerson, William Wallace, Matt Gebhardt, Keegan Murasaki, Joshua Daniel, Bear Wagner,
8079068	8107231	Alexander Rich, Orlando Vides, Sally Minamoto, Dylan Carey IP Freely, I think Some of these are funny Jordan Coward, Daniel Young I'm trying to greet the people that have pictures Jonathan Price, Bobby Bowden Let's see, let's give a couple more fuck yous here Courtesy of Orange Lounge Radio to the following users on positionfitspot.com Jose Carlton
8108266	8132769	Amy Veers, Anton Sinia, Aiden Woodruff, Benjamin Lee, Alex Diaz, Nikita Belkolpyatov, Harvey Vdarsky, and Luca Patterson.
8133945	8146329	a hearty fuck you from Orange Lounge Radio I just, I don't know I brought that up to say that that Sims parody letter is awesome and that you can't please everybody or someone will always have a problem with what you're doing.
8146429	8148750	This is people looking for drama where there is none.
8149310	8153412	It's like what is so boring in your life that you have to make drama to be upset about?
8154392	8154972	Seriously?
8155413	8156353	The world is not about you.
8156983	8160745	My favorite, though, is that there are totally people trolling that, like half of the signatures are trolls.
8160765	8163407	Well, there was one that I wanted you to read, but it was obviously a troll one.
8163427	8163687	What was that?
8163707	8168170	It was like some gay dude that wants to get boned every day or something.
8168190	8169471	It was, I don't know, funny.
8171172	8171512	There you go.
8171532	8173333	All right, ready for the next?
8173753	8173973	Yes.
8174634	8175534	Hello, OLR.
8175594	8180457	First off, I want to let you know that I'm typing this on my iPhone, so if there are any weird words, it's probably autocorrect.
8181438	8182218	Okay.
8183659	8197004	A while ago I emailed asking if either the OLR crew or anyone in the chat room knew of any video game characters who wear knitted clothing, like Riku Scarf in Final Fantasy X-2 or Nora S. Thyme's sweater in Final Fantasy XIII.
8197764	8200445	I'm still looking for suggestions, but I found another character.
8200985	8203746	Final Fantasy III's Lunath, some purple sweater under his jacket.
8204247	8204687	That's true.
8205447	8208089	Sky requested that I send some pics of past projects.
8208149	8209750	I've included some of my past works.
8210191	8215434	The gray afghan I'm working on now and that green scarf also doubled as a shawl for this petite model.
8216295	8220718	I'm looking forward for suggestions on video game characters knitted attire, so let me know.
8220758	8221979	You should totally knit me stuff.
8222840	8223961	Can you knit a Mobius scarf?
8224761	8225522	Because I totally want one.
8225662	8231766	Anyway, on a completely random note, the other night I had a really screwed up dream where the three OLR hosts were included.
8231886	8233508	Oh, I don't know if I'm afraid.
8233528	8233928	Anyway,
8234148	8251901	for some reason we were in some Everglades slash Marsh looking place and me and DarkSakura were in one dune buggy and Loki and Skye were in another following us a building to our left exploded like a balloon filled with water as we drove by it for some reason they veered off the path and were following a higher path that swerved in and out of the main that we were on
8253302	8255744	Don't eat before you go to bed Don't eat before you go to bed
8284426	8313229	make you dream weird shit or don't sleep with NyQuil tonight on the Orange Lounge Radio knitting and crocheting video game show we're going to talk about how to knit a nice little scarf I think this stuff is kind of neat actually where they're taking this one step further into the whole making tangible goods from video game inspired stuff and I know DarkSakura you're really into this
8314291	8330679	I'm surprised there aren't more people that kind of like crochet the whole like 8-bit patterns using the old sprite graphics to like make those what are those things the needle point or whatever this is gonna be a bray yeah but I'm talking about like can't you like stitch a like sprite into those
8332314	8359517	you theoretically could on a crocheted item you just need the grid but Becky does needlepoint and then there's cross stitch I think in a recent issue of the official World of Warcraft magazine they feature a fan who does handmade plushies that are very intricate and exquisitely done she's not allowed to sell them but because they're so good they gave her a pictorial in the magazine so she makes like moonkin plushies and
8361319	8364242	I want a walrus person, whatever they're called.
8366365	8366925	I want them.
8367446	8368347	These should be playable.
8369148	8369709	You never know.
8371591	8372252	Let's see the pictures.
8373233	8374094	Oh, I closed it.
8374174	8374614	Hold on.
8375115	8375515	Hold on!
8377270	8377590	Check this out.
8377610	8378031	There you go.
8378051	8378611	There's one picture?
8378631	8378792	Oh, wow.
8402566	8403166	Very intricate.
8403406	8404207	Yeah, very intricate.
8404847	8406568	I can't nip for shit, but I can sure croquet.
8406708	8407288	Hey, you rhymed.
8409069	8410050	Oh, sheep!
8411430	8412331	That's so cute.
8414952	8416453	Oh, it has little numbers on the sheep.
8416493	8416913	That's cute.
8416933	8417834	They're counting sheep.
8418074	8418574	I get it.
8419855	8421716	And it is just so fantastic radio, huh?
8421756	8422896	It's amazing radio.
8422996	8424537	Let's look at some pictures together, guys.
8424557	8425558	And there's a scarf.
8427238	8428319	And a pretty lady wearing it.
8430097	8433039	My chair's decided that it doesn't want to stay up anymore.
8434100	8435160	Well, this is like his model.
8435501	8435761	Yeah.
8435961	8436421	Look at that.
8439083	8440464	She kind of looks like she's been crying, though.
8440504	8441004	Don't be sad.
8441024	8441565	You're wearing pretty stars.
8441585	8442945	That's red eye from the camera, Rob.
8444026	8445227	From back here, it looks like crying.
8445247	8445927	I'm like, don't be crying.
8445947	8446548	You're wearing pretty stars.
8446568	8447308	It needs color correction.
8448289	8448969	She better be crying.
8448989	8449810	Photoshop, please.
8450791	8451091	All right.
8451391	8451891	Let's move on.
8451931	8454193	This is a terrible video where we're looking at pictures.
8454213	8454853	That's actually cool.
8454893	8455814	Kind of like a houndstooth.
8458255	8458476	All right.
8458496	8458916	Last email.
8461323	8462023	Hi, OLR.
8462083	8466406	Seeing as the mailbag has been rather light as of late, I thought I'd send an email for the upcoming show.
8466926	8470649	I just wanted to touch on a few subjects, but I'll try to keep this email from going on too long.
8470929	8471569	You failed.
8471890	8474651	I was going to say, I see a wall of words from back here.
8477031	8479312	Wall of Words crits you for 9,000 hit points.
8481393	8488197	First off, as of the time I typed this on Thursday afternoon, there's no notable free videos on the PSN Video Store.
8488797	8493800	If something were to be added between now and when the OLR airs, we're the OLR now.
8494540	8497323	I'll mention it either in chat or via Twitter topics.
8497843	8518881	Although there's nothing good that's free so far, I should mention the PSN Video Store does have a petty decent sale going on for the outright purchase of SD versions of miscellaneous comedy movies such as Airplane, Disaster Movie, Joe Dirt, RV, Team America, several MST3K titles, etc.,
8519842	8527729	as well as three stand-up comedy specials and select seasons of Super Jail, Aqua Teen Hunger Force, and the anime series called Dururara?
8528330	8529231	The Complete Series.
8529551	8530031	Excuse you.
8530572	8530732	Yeah.
8531453	8537178	The movies and stand-up specials are normally $10 while the other stuff is normally $2 but during the sale they're half
8540299	8560229	on the subject of video stores I've noticed that the XBL slash Zune video marketplace has been updated to include a new tab specifically for free TV shows, sneak previews, etc this should be very helpful that stuff has been grouped together in one place rather than having to hunt around for it at all
8561810	8567293	Lastly, I want to touch on the PS3 version of Free Realms, which has been released via PSN this past Tuesday.
8567694	8574458	Although I haven't put enough time into it to give a full, fair review of it, I at least would like to give my early impressions of it, which are mixed.
8575138	8579101	Frankly, there's a few, a couple things hurting it.
8579201	8580182	Was it a few or a couple?
8609793	8619362	In terms of the game's overall appearance, it can best be described as if Mr. Rogers had made a stew out of Barney, the Teletubbies, most Nickelodeon cartoons, and the Power Rangers.
8619843	8624127	Eight said stew, then vomited all over Unicorn, a bunny-infested world of Warcraft.
8624147	8625248	That's about right.
8625508	8629191	Whether this is a positive or negative is purely subjective and personal preference.
8629932	8631773	This email has been brought to you by NyQuil.
8631813	8639599	Capital N, small y, big fucking Q. NyQuil, NyQuil, NyQuil, we love you, you giant fucking Q. See, DarkSakura, I can quote Dennis Leary too.
8641740	8642041	That's it.
8643382	8647124	Well, I guess somebody kind of agrees with me on Free Realms.
8649526	8655510	It's a horrible piece of crap game that makes no sense, that you have no idea what to do.
8655590	8656691	Not that there's anything wrong with that.
8657312	8657772	No, I'm kidding.
8658248	8659849	I call it the sphincter of MMOs.
8659889	8663111	It's not the worst game I've ever played, but it's just not good.
8663171	8664292	The sphincter of MMOs.
8664652	8665833	It's not the crap that comes out.
8665853	8669675	I don't know if it's the sphincter, but it's definitely like the upper intestine.
8671176	8676439	Well, my reason for saying the sphincter is because it's not the crap, it's just where the crap comes from.
8677159	8677439	Okay.
8678300	8678680	You win.
8680101	8683603	Let's get angsty and do some angry, raw FUs of the week.
8700442	8706966	My FU goes towards the repaving of the sidewalk, the street outside of my house.
8707426	8714730	Because they're closing the street tomorrow and Tuesday from, I want to say, 7 in the morning until 5 in the afternoon.
8715670	8742778	and I really shouldn't have to leave my house until like 9 to get to school because I'm making up time at school and instead I have to park my house a block away at my friend's house so that I can walk to my car in the morning and then go to school which is not that far, I'm not complaining about walking but I complain about walking that I shouldn't have to do they should do this like at night with sound mufflers around them
8744983	8746703	or they should give us money to be in communities.
8747024	8748764	But I guess we're getting anywhere without an exploit.
8749204	8749764	Money rocks.
8751945	8752225	Loki!
8754345	8757406	Um... I don't know, there's not a whole lot that I'm really mad about.
8757466	8761427	Just, I guess, F you to lack of sleep because I haven't been getting a lot of sleep.
8762147	8771390	I have to wake up way early in the morning and, you know, one or two days isn't bad but doing it for eight months straight now takes a toll on you.
8771410	8772570	It makes you go a little crazy!
8774358	8775739	Oh, you were already crazy, Loki.
8776559	8778901	I know, and just compounded on top of that.
8780162	8781523	Um, I don't know.
8781603	8782803	Things have been pretty good for me.
8782823	8784825	I don't really have a lot to say F you to do.
8785245	8785465	Ants.
8786126	8787046	Yes, F you to ants.
8787506	8788547	Oh, little bastards.
8788867	8789288	I hate them.
8789708	8790288	That's a good one.
8790328	8790688	Thank you.
8790949	8791449	Slash spot.
8791469	8791809	How about you?
8793110	8797533	Even if it's for really good reasons, like a new job or, you know...
8800095	8823998	a new beginning or whatever the process of moving as an adult is one of the most annoying bullshitty things a grown person can do to themselves you've got to change your address get the stupid postal card pack up everything you own get friends to help you move even if it's awesome and nothing goes wrong moving is bullshit there you go
8825583	8826523	Moving is hard.
8826963	8827784	It's for grown-ups.
8828584	8829184	No, it stinks.
8829204	8829744	I don't like it.
8830244	8830504	All right.
8831465	8833185	Anyhow, that's it for the FUs of the week.
8833425	8838067	Let's move on to a couple more stories and then your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
8839187	8844969	As if we didn't need more reasons to believe that there's going to be a new Grand Theft Auto announced at E3.
8846849	8852251	Well, there's been a casting call for people to do some character...
8853315	8873070	voiceover work and one of those characters happens to be from the Grand Theft Auto universe including the guy's name is James Pattison and he was a guest aside character at least in San Andreas where he openly recounted acts of pedophilia and
8873791	8881147	and in Grand Theft Auto 4 he was arrested by the Indonesian police after being suspected of child molestation in Bali.
8882289	8882690	So...
8883965	8888628	Yeah, apparently he's coming back in the next game, and someone's going to be doing the voice for him.
8889909	8893150	Some other characters they name as well, they're pretty generic sounding.
8893671	8900095	Samantha, a young female obsessed with sex parties, always dreaming of being a Hollywood celebrity.
8901495	8902816	Also, let's see here...
8907762	8908082	What else?
8908282	8911605	There were some other characters I thought they were talking about too as well.
8911625	8912926	A lot of weird stuff.
8915868	8917849	But yeah, so probably new game coming out.
8918169	8919711	I would not be surprised next year.
8921952	8922493	Exciting!
8922613	8923073	I love it!
8924194	8928297	And the rumor is that it's supposed to be going back to Los Santos, which was from San Andreas.
8928877	8930959	Probably one of the best Grand Theft Auto games ever.
8930979	8931199	Yeah.
8932259	8934680	I think a new Grand Theft Auto game is kind of a given.
8934760	8939061	San Andreas was an analog of LA in that game.
8939601	8941682	Was Los Santos Las Vegas or no?
8941822	8946584	No, Los Santos was part of San Andreas because there's three cities in San Andreas.
8946644	8950945	It was Los Santos, San Friera, and Las Venturas.
8951105	8954046	Las Venturas was the analog of San Francisco.
8954086	8956527	Vegas, San Francisco, and Los Angeles.
8958687	8960208	Alright, but that game was massive.
8960228	8960608	It's just
8961551	8962052	Thanks for watching!
8980167	9000943	I've got the old hot coffee disc from the Playstation 2 and my sister's been borrowing it forever even though she doesn't need to because there's a rip on the hard drive of that Playstation 2 that she has so I just need to get back and play it on my generation 1 Playstation 3 full backwards compatibility oh yeah
9002714	9011816	All right, well, one more story for you guys before we get to the phone calls, and this is about a man named Phil Fish, and you might not know that game, or you might not know that name, but he is making the game Fez.
9012196	9019617	It's an indie game, and it's going to be coming out on Xbox Live Arcade, possibly the PC and the PlayStation 3, but probably not the Wii.
9020297	9028039	In an interview with Destructoid, he was quoted saying, quote, "...right now we're only concentrating on XBLA, which makes the most sense for us at the time."
9028419	9033821	PC and PlayStation Network would also make a lot of sense, but in my opinion, WiiWare just wouldn't be worth our time and effort.
9034181	9037902	It's a dismal system that I don't want to deal with, neither as a customer nor a developer.
9038102	9038662	No demos?
9038962	9039482	Fuck off.
9040162	9042003	And that's a quote from this guy.
9042043	9044984	So he basically told the WiiWare system it can go, you know, fuck off.
9046205	9050908	Now, granted, this guy, I don't want to say he's a nobody, but his game hasn't really been proven yet.
9051028	9055252	He's one of those garage developers that Nintendo kind of doesn't want in their house anyway.
9056252	9066780	So I don't know if this story carries a lot of weight, but, I mean, the guy did kind of have the balls to call out Nintendo, but I kind of think it's not going to really change a goddamn thing in the scope of things.
9067361	9068402	But he really does have a point.
9068602	9071244	Why do people keep developing for WiiWare when it's kind of shit?
9072304	9072784	Exactly.
9073425	9089817	And as I posted on Twitter earlier this week, remember Nintendo was commenting on how they wanted to make sure they kept the garage developers out because in order to make sure that there's quality products coming out on WiiWare and DSiWare and stuff like that.
9090397	9092218	Guess what came out on DSiWare this week?
9092778	9098839	It was a program to take pictures of your friends and put them in funny Halloween-themed backgrounds.
9099240	9099940	It looked like shit.
9100000	9101420	It looked like something that was on the iOS platform.
9101480	9102861	Yay, clip art!
9103201	9104881	Wait, Halloween-themed?
9105041	9108242	Yes, like monster-themed stuff.
9109362	9111643	I'm sorry, the best one on the iPhone was that hair one.
9112501	9113622	Oh, yeah, that was funny.
9114503	9117426	And the Make Your Friends Fat application is funny, too.
9117446	9118026	And the Unicorn.
9118667	9119968	I mean, it was absolutely terrible.
9120108	9126434	And perfect week to come out, right after I just said, or right after they said, oh, we need to make sure quality's on there.
9126734	9129157	Yeah, that's some quality shit right there.
9129277	9132019	You're so much better than the iOS platform.
9132099	9138065	What was I thinking, even contemplating that you would ever allow something that terrible to be on your network?
9138985	9141887	Oh, Nintendo, you don't need these garage developers at all.
9141907	9144208	You got your Mario games that you're recaching putting out.
9144668	9146029	So, whatever, that's fine.
9146049	9149211	They're better off, you know, not going to the WiiWare service.
9149537	9150898	But seriously, I mean, come on.
9151318	9151819	Demos.
9152079	9154441	I mean, demos have been around for fucking years now.
9154461	9157063	And you can't implement demos on your WiiWare service.
9157363	9160085	Or you just don't want to because a lot of the shit's crap on there.
9160205	9162907	And it's just terrible games.
9162967	9165069	And, oh, haha, you downloaded it too late.
9165949	9167631	Nintendo just kind of doesn't get online.
9167671	9169692	I think it's the same story every week.
9169752	9171293	Okay, they don't get online.
9171714	9174536	And they don't have any demos for Wii games.
9174616	9176117	They don't have any demos for any...
9176637	9180639	I mean, they had demos one time for a select few WiiWare games, so it is possible.
9182140	9183920	Fuck it, we don't give a shit.
9184200	9185421	Our customers don't need demos.
9185681	9187162	Our quality speaks for itself.
9187222	9188162	It should be a no-brainer.
9188302	9189703	I must buy everything, Nintendo.
9191924	9219359	the developers of Super Meat Boy which I think is one of the most successful indie games since Braid really the two studios that were most willing to work with them was XBLA and Steam Sony wasn't really interested in the game and when they wanted to put out a WiiWare edition of Super Meat Boy they were fine with the no demo thing but just the restrictions they had to put on the game really crippled it they just cancelled the whole thing because the WiiWare platform and how big the game has to be was shitty
9219719	9224662	I mean, this is a company that thinks that users can't understand megabytes.
9224842	9228044	They have to put it down to blocks.
9228464	9232787	Really, how is 5 megabytes and 5 blocks any fucking different?
9232827	9239331	I mean, other than being really confusing to the fact that how many... When you have 64 and you take away 2...
9240191	9240771	You're left with 62.
9241232	9248456	Yeah, but then you have to figure out, okay, I have a 2 gigabyte memory card that's in my 3DS or in my Wii system.
9248676	9250256	How many fucking blocks is that?
9252218	9252738	I don't know.
9253538	9254019	No one knows.
9254039	9255499	Is the 3DS still speaking blocks?
9255519	9256020	Yes, it does.
9256140	9256600	Oh, God.
9258516	9259256	Yes, it does.
9259517	9262098	I mean, come on, man.
9262738	9264459	Everybody's using computers nowadays.
9266060	9268981	The term megabyte's been around forever.
9269161	9271843	Even if they don't, they have an 8 gig iPod.
9271983	9273163	They know what 8 gig means.
9274124	9275705	The terminology is everywhere now.
9276305	9280267	And even still, though, why is it so hard to, you know, megabyte?
9280367	9286170	Okay, well, I don't know what a megabyte is, but I know that I have this many on this memory card.
9287494	9288415	How is that difficult?
9289076	9289496	It's not.
9289736	9290437	It really isn't.
9290537	9294580	But for whatever reason, they decided, let's go ahead and do that again.
9295001	9301146	Just like they make a lot of poor decisions when it comes to different software and features that they have on these systems.
9301506	9301826	Whatever.
9301866	9302667	You know what, Nintendo?
9302707	9308652	You can play this game as long as you want, and your system will be successful for a while, and eventually you're going to hit that slump again.
9308672	9310173	They mark it to grandmother's.
9311193	9317317	You're going to hit that slump again, and then you're going to be in fucking last place, and all that shit, now you've got to catch up again.
9318177	9321559	So ride the wave while you can, but eventually it's going to come crashing down.
9323480	9323900	All right.
9324521	9326322	Well, let's get to the Skype line.
9326342	9328303	We're going to open that on up.
9328323	9331845	1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9331905	9332525	Give us a call.
9333063	9334384	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9358081	9367648	Sony wants access to all those people's hard drives that filed for the other OS lawsuits because they're saying they may be part of a bigger hacker conspiracy.
9368028	9368409	Thank you.
9368609	9373652	So basically they're saying everybody that wanted Linux on their system, they're a hacker and they're out to destroy Sony.
9373692	9375414	Wasn't the government using it?
9375634	9377735	Oh yeah, but they're hackers and they're out to destroy Sony.
9378296	9382359	Why put that in your system if you think that everybody's hackers out to destroy Sony?
9383797	9388781	If Sony made the goddamn system, why don't they just make some program that lets them see what's in the system?
9388821	9391363	I'm sure they could do that remotely, like a whole Skynet thing.
9391403	9392204	It's just terrible.
9392284	9393044	But here's the thing.
9393185	9406095	I mean, well, if you think about it, though, if they made some sort of program and they had it where you connected online to see that kind of stuff, that would update their system and they would be unable to have the other OS in there because you can't update your system anymore if you want to keep that.
9407356	9407556	But...
9408837	9413021	The real... Well, one reason they wanted to see the hard drives is to make sure that they actually did have other OS on.
9413061	9415504	And this is their PlayStation 3 hard drives, not their PCs.
9416465	9418507	They wanted to make sure they had other OS on there.
9418627	9424073	But at the same time, though, and the judge doesn't understand, is when you put other OS on there, it's now a computer.
9424453	9431380	And you need to go through the protocols for discovery for that kind of stuff where you have to have a third-party company look at the stuff.
9431460	9432161	Not Sony...
9432622	9439699	Going through and having full access to your hard drive of your now computer Alright, let's go to the phones Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
9440342	9441063	Hey, it's Ranma.
9441083	9441763	What's up, everyone?
9466287	9471629	Nothing much, just trying to recover for a sleepy Sunday night listening to your show.
9472449	9480211	But yeah, just going on the debate of how Nintendo's basically... They're basically regressive at this point.
9480671	9486753	I mean, they're pissing off devs to... And it goes back to how much pride they have.
9486833	9489654	Remember how they covertly...
9491303	9494049	Dist, you know, the developers of Angry Birds.
9494169	9495051	Yes, I remember that.
9495152	9500784	The CEO actually, like, he actually, you know, he didn't mention it in name, but he actually mentioned them.
9501826	9505747	and, you know, within that same aspect that they're just, like, bringing down the wages.
9505867	9516450	Kind of like, you know, it's kind of like those, uh, you ever seen that episode of South Park where the, you know, the Goobax episode, and you see the guy shouting, they took our jobs.
9516850	9517930	It's pretty much like that.
9517970	9529814	They're complaining about how, just because it's a zero-sum game, well, to them it appears to be a zero-sum game, that it's just like, it's not worth, it doesn't pay to be a developer anymore.
9530314	9530934	But in the other...
9531647	9531947	DarkSakura
9552588	9555230	You would see that it's a pretty big number.
9555450	9556171	Even myself.
9556511	9561515	Think of the shit tons they're making not just off the game itself, but all the licensed tie-ins now.
9561695	9562596	Exactly.
9562636	9563036	Think about it.
9563056	9566939	They have a free version on the Android market that runs on ads alone.
9566979	9571923	How many impressions are that through AdSense?
9571963	9573924	That's a lot.
9574305	9581250	They make a crap ton of money aside from selling it for 99 cents, which it pays for itself after a few plays.
9583129	9585631	So Nintendo's just threatened by that lower price point.
9585691	9595759	I mean, Nintendo also, God, go in any hot topic and next to like one Angry Birds shirt, you'll see like 20 Nintendo classic franchise shirts.
9595819	9599242	You know, everybody has a Nintendo lives off nostalgia, man.
9599662	9600522	But that's the thing.
9600962	9608844	Nintendo, on the other hand, I know they basically are marketing the Wii as more of a casual gamer system.
9609304	9617185	Therefore, setting aside all the hardcores that they marketed to in the past.
9618326	9620146	I mean, that's pretty much it.
9620746	9624707	What's happening is that they're getting outgunned by other more
9626374	9629839	or easily available platforms like an iPhone or an Android.
9630019	9633965	Something that most people would have in their pocket aside from a DS.
9634486	9637210	And it's more than capable of running those games.
9639193	9640995	Alright, anything else on your mind tonight, Zaku?
9642632	9648254	Back to the Future, the game, the first episode is pretty much free from their Telltale Games site.
9648615	9649935	It's pretty awesome so far.
9650235	9651236	Yeah, you having a good time with that?
9651336	9654537	Even contrary to what the others are saying, it's getting better.
9655217	9657518	I'm hearing the third episode is actually the best so far.
9658318	9660579	I'm really excited for their Jurassic Park game.
9660679	9662960	I don't know what it is, but they had a new trailer.
9662980	9669543	It's like an adventure game where you just click around to solve puzzles based on the storyline of Back to the Future.
9669563	9670223	Mm-hmm.
9671167	9676129	and the guy who basically does Marty's voice is very close.
9676329	9678951	Does almost a spot on impression of Michael J. Fox.
9679311	9679551	Nice.
9679611	9681132	You have to actually listen to it though.
9681612	9681812	I do.
9681892	9683553	I really need to play the Back to the Future.
9683873	9688255	I forgot that it was the free time for it now that it's out.
9688275	9692557	Because I remember the whole story is about the code word being in the Blu-ray and everything.
9692577	9693957	So that's cool that it's out there for free now.
9693977	9694898	So I'll definitely have to check that out.
9694938	9696379	The first episode is out for free.
9696699	9696879	Right.
9696979	9698640	They're going to get you on the other ones though.
9698940	9699100	Yeah.
9700089	9701612	Alright, well, Zaku, take care, buddy.
9701733	9702775	We'll see you next time.
9703356	9703837	Alright, bye.
9710492	9714595	Contradictory things in both cases, so they're lying somewhere.
9736147	9736927	Oh, that's Sony America.
9736967	9737568	They're behind it.
9737588	9738068	Which is it, Sony?
9738088	9741570	You're on record saying both, so you perjured yourself one way or another.
9757387	9757687	All right.
9757707	9759989	We're going to try this call again, see if it's better.
9760029	9760829	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9760849	9761190	Who's this?
9761810	9762371	It's Ranma.
9762411	9763471	Can you hear me better now?
9763511	9765413	Yes, and you're not giving that horrible feedback.
9765453	9766293	I don't know what that was about.
9766914	9768795	I think it's something with my computer.
9768815	9771717	I think it's long overdue for a fresh Windows installation.
9771917	9774839	Maybe Sony is trying to get inside your computer and see what you're really doing with it.
9775620	9780163	Either that, maybe because Logitech gets pissed because I dumped their headset for a better Microsoft one.
9780443	9782144	Sony Cat is watching you masturbate.
9782905	9784105	I could give two shits about that.
9784245	9784506	All right.
9785386	9786207	What's on your mind tonight?
9787263	9794926	Something a little bit different as if you remember what we talked about NPM last week, I upgraded my phone.
9795326	9800148	I now have an Android phone and I'm doing something I thought I'd never find myself doing.
9800228	9800608	What's that?
9802034	9802735	Mobile gaming.
9803295	9804076	Oh my gosh.
9804216	9804597	All right.
9805418	9807059	Took the plunge and do some mobile gaming.
9807239	9812785	Now, do you have a phone that has like actual tangible controls or is like an all touchscreen phone like the iPhone?
9813566	9813826	Both.
9814647	9817390	I have the Samsung Epic 4G touchscreen.
9817510	9819632	If I slide it out, I have keyboard access.
9819893	9820093	Nice.
9821533	9828437	But so far the games I've played is completely in total touchscreen, which is not so bad, even with the screen protector on it.
9829438	9830599	Well, what kind of games have you been playing?
9830679	9831719	Tell us about some of the better ones.
9832440	9837483	Well, you could probably assume I have that game everyone has been talking about, Angry Birds.
9837823	9838223	Of course.
9839304	9842426	I'm playing it, I'm like, I can see why people are into it.
9842526	9846188	It's like the new version of Worms or something like that, you know?
9848625	9854831	And as I was going through the marketplace, I came across this one game that you probably tickled pink over the name of it.
9856573	9857454	It's called Pew Pew.
9858255	9859076	Pew Pew!
9860998	9861378	What is it?
9861398	9862980	Does it involve kittens with lasers?
9864061	9866764	No, it's pretty much Geometry Wars.
9867164	9867725	Oh, that's kind of cool.
9869141	9871243	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9886918	9892624	And as I'm going through the marketplace, I can understand why Nintendo said what they said.
9892905	9896328	I think the GDC about these games on the 3DS.
9896628	9896829	Right.
9897309	9901934	Because I look through here and I'm like, yeah, a lot of these games are total and utter crap.
9902034	9906439	Call me crazy if I'm dropping $250 on a gaming comp.
9906799	9909122	I'd like some quality games, you know?
9909322	9909502	Right.
9911055	9911415	DarkSakura.com
9926913	9930375	for like $20 or something like that, that probably wouldn't be so bad.
9930535	9933356	You know, funny enough, there's something like that on Steam, or at least there was.
9933416	9934917	It was either April Fool's Day or the day after.
9934937	9939219	There was like 13 independent games going for like maybe $29 or $39.
9940480	9941921	And one of them was like Super Meat Boy.
9941941	9943441	There were some big titles in there.
9943521	9946283	VVV, which I think Actdeft's called in about before was in there.
9946623	9947623	Yeah, I remember that.
9947784	9951365	Yeah, high-profile indie games was in this big pack lately.
9951765	9954647	So sometimes the indie games will band together for big sales like that.
9956124	9956584	Definitely.
9956904	9965128	And I started to notice that, yeah, I'm playing, I'm playing around with these games a lot more than my DS because my phone is right there.
9965168	9967389	Pull it out, hit the button, the game starts.
9967689	9971571	Whereas I got to pull it out of my bag, fire it up, pick the game and start it up.
9971651	9973632	You know, I guess it's like convenience.
9973752	9976293	It's a portable system where you don't have to think about grabbing the system.
9976513	9977734	You just, you always have it on you.
9979194	9980035	And definitely, yes.
9981104	9982745	Never Surrender, Never, Billy Mitchell
10010241	10015285	And I just noticed that it's a limited edition shirt with his signature.
10015986	10019069	It says, Billy Mitchell, Video Game Player of the Century.
10020250	10021851	How about Jerk Face of the Century?
10022391	10023893	I like that even better.
10025794	10027316	Oh, I'm sure he's a nice guy.
10027496	10028397	No, he's not actually.
10029017	10029758	He's a big jerk.
10030579	10032340	No, I've never talked to the guy.
10033001	10034922	But he apparently sells really good barbecue sauce.
10035283	10035443	Hey.
10037042	10039783	Let me be the judge of that because I love my barbecue sauce.
10040184	10040564	Me too.
10041044	10042164	All right, Ranma, we're going to let you go.
10042224	10044385	Try to fit in one more call before we end the Skype tonight.
10044425	10045286	So take care, buddy.
10045566	10045746	Bye.
10046246	10046426	Bye.
10046606	10046786	Bye.
10048047	10048607	All right.
10048847	10052689	Let's see if we can take one more call on the Skype line.
10052709	10055810	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
10056170	10057431	Any other stories?
10058789	10060030	Yeah, there is a new game.
10060050	10062391	I don't know if you've ever played the game QWOP.
10062411	10063792	Remember QWOP?
10064653	10065853	I have not played QWOP.
10065913	10067094	I've played a lot of crap.
10067394	10068435	Yeah, I have.
10068455	10075719	But anyways, there's a new game called GURP, and it's a rock climbing game that requires you to basically kind of...
10076800	10078201	Hey, DarkTedStudio, what's up buddy?
10106767	10108408	Oh, I think you can probably, yeah.
10108548	10111949	I know, I was going to say, this has got to be about WonderCon.
10112030	10115091	I know you were really excited about your trip out to WonderCon, which happened this week.
10115491	10117352	Tell us about some of the games you saw at WonderCon.
10119833	10120393	Oh, man.
10120413	10129838	Well, Nintendo had a huge booth, and they were showing off all of the 3DS games they had.
10130118	10131739	Did anything catch your eyes over there?
10131759	10132359	It was pretty cool.
10134577	10135859	Oh, I liked that a little bit.
10135919	10136701	Steel Diver.
10137121	10137342	Uh-huh.
10137362	10139746	That one was pretty cool.
10139866	10141549	Was that the first time you ever got to touch a 3DS?
10141629	10143512	Was that the first time you ever got to get your hands on a 3DS?
10143913	10144293	Yeah.
10144514	10145656	What'd you think about the 3D?
10145736	10147519	What'd you think about it when you first saw it?
10149195	10151416	Badly also had Kate Icarus Oh, did they?
10151436	10152897	Nice, was it playable or was it just like a trailer?
10179526	10180447	Yeah, no, it was playable.
10180927	10181287	Oh, shit, nice.
10181307	10184189	I felt like, I don't know if you ever played Sin and Punishment.
10184449	10184709	Uh-huh.
10186510	10187711	Yeah, it kind of felt like that.
10188011	10188332	Nice.
10188472	10199979	By the way, Sin and Punishment was... Sin and Punishment was another one of those games that Fries, that they had like 20 extra copies of that they were trying to get rid of, the new one that was out on the Wii.
10200559	10201560	It's unfortunate.
10202020	10203041	Anyway, sorry about that, DT.
10203101	10205202	Yeah, it's all right.
10205563	10208785	But, okay, well, what other, like, did Capcom have anything?
10208825	10210426	I know you always try to run over there and look at their booth.
10212307	10218991	Oh, yeah, well, most of the stuff they had, those stuff was already out, but they did have Resident Evil, which was, oh, it's alright, I guess.
10219171	10219551	Oh, cool.
10220492	10220852	I don't know.
10221932	10223013	I had a little trouble with it.
10224734	10225114	What else?
10225194	10225715	Any other games?
10228956	10231658	Let's see, they had the, all the big movie games.
10232065	10235846	comic book movie games like Thor and Captain America and Green Lantern
10254406	10254887	Oh, well, whatever.
10255347	10255567	What?
10255708	10256669	Huge superhero?
10256689	10258050	Comic book movies.
10258291	10261374	There's Thor, there's Captain America, Green Lantern.
10261394	10262656	There's the big three.
10263937	10265239	There's X-Men First Class.
10265339	10267461	Is the Spider-Man reboot this year or is that next year?
10267501	10268502	No, that's not for a while.
10268563	10268903	Next year.
10269504	10269664	Huh.
10270104	10274567	And, um, but they're also, I think, going to be rebooting Fantastic Four.
10274607	10278029	Transformers, if you want to count that as a... Another Superman.
10279110	10280230	And, uh, Batman.
10281171	10284873	Oh, yeah, Batman 3's next year, and that I'm excited about, but I don't know how the game would be.
10285814	10292878	Well, I did see your write-up, uh, is available over at orangeloungeradio.com, so it looks like you kept a little deer diary while you were there and saw stuff.
10293078	10294999	Now, I have to ask, did you get to see the masquerade at all?
10296940	10297641	Yeah, a little bit.
10297801	10298822	Since I had costumes...
10300225	10304864	Did you see by chance the Main Street Electronica Parade?
10306664	10307825	Oh no, I didn't see that.
10308125	10308305	Oh wow.
10331880	10333480	Alright, well DT, I'm glad you had fun at the show.
10333601	10335621	You know, we will actually have to go some year.
10335661	10340002	This was just really not a good year for me to go, but I am hoping we will go to 5A this year.
10340702	10342263	That is something we're trying to do, so we'll see.
10342703	10342923	Alright.
10343183	10344804	Probably going to go back next year, so.
10345164	10345404	Awesome.
10345424	10346504	Well, we'll try to make it next year.
10347264	10347524	Alright.
10348265	10350865	Take care and check out that article at orangelaundry.com by DT.
10350945	10351526	Alright, bye guys.
10352966	10353066	Yep.
10354514	10355434	I don't know why I said guys.
10355715	10356595	I said bye to you guys.
10356675	10357175	Bye to you guys.
10357195	10358035	I'm going to go read that article.
10358396	10358656	All right.
10359116	10360917	No, it is about time to say bye, guys.
10361157	10361997	The show is about over.
10362857	10364598	Thanks, you guys, though, for tuning in to us.
10364618	10365919	We're going to close up the Skype line.
10366199	10367900	If you didn't get through tonight, sorry.
10368440	10369880	Try sending us an email next time.
10370401	10374082	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadar.com is the place where you can send us an email.
10374983	10378444	Let me ask Loki one more time if there's any last-minute stories before we wrap it all up.
10378604	10379545	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
10396920	10397861	Head tracking, pretty awesome.
10397881	10401882	They're saying, yes, you'll be able to use head tracking to look into the corners when you're driving and stuff.
10402103	10408806	Although that's a little awkward for me, I think, because if your TV's in front of you, you can't really turn your head to the side.
10408826	10411007	It's going to be a little weird, yeah.
10411207	10418911	And that'd be cool if the multiple monitors support or whatever, but once again, why would you need head tracking if you have multiple monitors?
10420511	10423993	But hey, glad to see they're using head tracking, so that'll be awesome.
10426013	10426873	Alright, very cool.
10427093	10431515	This might be a little hint of what is to come for the next generation of Kinect and this could be very, very good.
10431795	10432035	Yeah.
10432055	10432515	So we'll see.
10433135	10438897	Alright, well it's that time of the show where we go around and get everybody's final thought as we wrap up another week here at Orange Lounge Radio.
10439237	10440958	Salacious Pop, thanks again for being here.
10441138	10442239	You did a lot of talking this week.
10442259	10442939	I'm very proud of you.
10443039	10443199	Yeah.
10443399	10446040	Alright, so thanks and do you have any final thoughts for our listeners?
10448040	10448161	No.
10448181	10448221	No.
10453340	10454261	Alright then, alright.
10455542	10457244	Let's see, DarkSakura, I guess I'll go to you next.
10457264	10458645	Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
10459486	10460247	I want more Pinkberry.
10462173	10491281	and my final thought along those lines is that the lychee pink berry can go to hell, blood orange forever it's not gross, it's good it's not blood orange but the mango is amazing whatever, it's not blood orange alright Loki, your final thoughts tonight um I don't know I'm down to my US 3DS system I got rid of all the rest aww, that's great did the wife catch ya?
10492692	10492892	No.
10493273	10494434	Woohoo!
10494674	10495776	He was like, why would she?
10495916	10496156	No.
10496637	10499160	And then you're going to come home, catch you what?
10500562	10502505	No, she doesn't listen to the show.
10502685	10504107	I was talking to her last week.
10504868	10506890	She listened for just a minute.
10507331	10508172	It was like...
10509213	10510754	Just long enough for a baby to hear daddy.
10511054	10512534	Pretty much, yeah.
10513995	10516575	She's trying to get him for two naps tonight.
10517276	10520797	Last night he woke up, like with me, I woke up with him at 5.
10520837	10522917	I usually wake up with him at 5 in the morning.
10523638	10524398	Every day.
10525418	10526279	On the weekends even.
10527319	10531440	And so he wouldn't go back down to bed for like about an hour.
10532080	10533421	Just trying to get him to go back down.
10533561	10535021	And he finally slept until 7.40.
10535061	10535121	But...
10537783	10559644	I'm actually now able to be wide awake at 5 in the morning which works out because I can work on my PC sometimes and able to work on Grand Theft Auto map edits and stuff like that really in the morning without being interrupted but it's tough I have to take naps now on the weekends sometimes because there's only so many days you can wake up that early and not be affected by it
10560545	10565448	Well, Rob naps every day and he doesn't even have a kid, so don't feel too bad.
10565528	10566229	You've earned those naps.
10566249	10569310	Hey, ring ring, hi pot, it's Kettle on the phone.
10570091	10579617	I wanted to say, and I know they're not listening obviously, and I don't think they listen normally, but congratulations to our friends Eric and Mel for their brand new baby girl.
10580337	10581438	So, that's awesome.
10581478	10582578	Someone finally had a girl.
10582999	10589863	I know, it's like a big sausage fest, but finally getting some girls in here.
10590207	10590578	Alright.
10591707	10594449	Alright, well that does it for another week here at Orange Lounge Radio.

10613880	10614240	Episode 409.
10615240	10617582	I guess that means we have to do some cleaning next week because it's 409.
10617622	10618542	Hey, I cleaned that desk.
10618582	10618722	You did.
10618742	10620043	You better not need cleaning next week.
10620764	10621344	I'll dirty it up.
10621364	10621444	Yeah.
10622284	10624846	It's dust free, lemony fresh.
10626026	10627067	But Shermie tainted.
10627947	10629008	Well, of course, duh.
10629788	10630029	All right.
10630289	10630729	That does it.
