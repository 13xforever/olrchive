24000	27000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	33000	Hello my friends out there on the internet
33000	35000	And welcome back to another week of the show
35000	37000	Where every gamer has a voice
37000	39000	Orange Lounge Radio

41000	43000	For this April 3rd, 2011
43000	44000	My name is Rob Roberts
44000	46000	I'll be joining you over the next few hours
46000	48000	With my co-host, the one and only
48000	50000	Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers
50000	51000	Fwee
51000	52000	How are you?
52000	53000	Fwee
53000	54000	I'm actually full
54000	55000	I'm actually full
55000	56000	Full?
56000	57000	I made a delicious
57000	58000	Full of crap?
58000	59000	Uh uh, no that's Shermie
59000	62000	I had a delicious meal that I cooked myself
62000	63000	Alright
63000	65000	By myself
65000	66000	Now bake me a pie
66000	68000	I don't know how to bake
68000	70000	Anything that I've ever baked
70000	73000	Except for my failure cake that I told you about last night
73000	74000	Has been a disaster
74000	76000	And can you tell the listeners what a failure cake is briefly
76000	77000	Failure cake
77000	78000	Before we get into video game time
78000	80000	Was me making chocolate pancakes
80000	81000	And then getting bored with the rest of the batter
81000	82000	Because I didn't want any more pancakes
82000	86000	So I poured the chocolate batter into a cake pan
86000	89000	And then put some giant chocolate chips on it
89000	91000	And then baked the whole thing
91000	92000	And it tasted delicious
92000	94000	I don't know about you guys, I'd still eat that
94000	95000	Even though it's a cake of failure
95000	97000	It was delicious, delicious fail
97000	98000	Alright
98000	99000	A host not full of fail
99000	101000	Say hello to the one and only tech master, Loki
101000	102000	Hello, how's it going?
102000	104000	I am good, how are you, Loki?
104000	105000	I am doing fine
105000	106000	Alright, except we are
106000	108000	Why are we not hearing you very well tonight?
108000	109000	I don't know
109000	110000	Why aren't you hearing me tonight?
110000	112000	I think we're hearing you, you're just really quiet
112000	114000	I'm really quiet?
114000	115000	Yeah, you're good now
115000	116000	Sorry
116000	117000	I think we have to keep you kind of low
117000	119000	Because when the Nintendo topics come up
119000	120000	Oh yeah
120000	121000	You'll get a little louder!
121000	125000	I'm not louder, I'm more opinionated
125000	126000	You're passionate
126000	128000	I am passionate, come on
128000	130000	It's like, I don't know
130000	133000	It's just stupid people doing stupid things
133000	136000	Alright, we've got a lot of interesting news stories tonight
136000	137000	Kind of along those lines
137000	139000	We'll get to those in just a little bit
139000	141000	But first let's say hello to a guest here in studio tonight
141000	142000	Back again this week
142000	143000	Say hello to Salacious Pop
143000	144000	What up
144000	145000	How you doing Salacious Pop?
145000	146000	Good
146000	148000	Good, how has life been treating you lately?
148000	149000	Um, been really busy
149000	150000	Yeah?
150000	151000	What's been going on?
151000	152000	Preparing for a move
152000	153000	Yeah?
153000	154000	You moving?
154000	155000	Yeah
155000	156000	You moving in with Jamie?
156000	157000	She's really lonely this week
157000	158000	Yeah
158000	159000	Alright
159000	160000	It's the vault, I'm just going to stay in the vault
160000	161000	Awesome
161000	162000	I don't even get to play anything, I just get to look at stuff
162000	163000	It's awesome
163000	164000	Now, we missed April Fools this year
164000	166000	Because the show tonight is on the third
166000	168000	But you were mentioning a really good April Fools joke
168000	169000	You thought we should have done
169000	171000	Well I can't talk about it or else I can't do it next year
171000	173000	Oh yeah, we got to do it next year I guess
173000	174000	Okay, it's really good y'all
174000	175000	It was basically like
175000	181000	OLR Episode 3 coming like from the vault of 1982
181000	182000	Where with the news stories you're like
182000	185000	Yeah, I'm really looking forward to that ET game on the Atari 2600
185000	186000	It's going to be great
186000	190000	The only thing about that is it's kind of close to what YouTube did
190000	191000	So it'll be better next year
191000	192000	Yeah
192000	193000	Next year y'all forget
193000	195000	It's a little too close to Flugelhorn feline
195000	197000	Which by the way was the best April Fools joke on the web
197000	198000	Just so you know
198000	199000	Alright, anyhow
199000	202000	Well, by the way, Rob, it's not a rumor
202000	204000	Now, see, oh
204000	205000	Okay, before we went live tonight
205000	208000	See, now I have to talk about all this because you brought it up
208000	209000	Okay, before we went live tonight
209000	211000	Bobby was abbreviated tonight
211000	212000	So we went live a little bit early
212000	216000	Just kind of BSing with the live listeners and doing some music
216000	218000	And one of the topics that came up before the show was
218000	220000	The Wachowski Brothers and they did The Matrix
220000	223000	And there's these rumors or something going around
223000	225000	That one of them had a sex change
225000	226000	Larry is now Lana
226000	228000	But now, see, the chat room, Tiger Closener chat room
228000	231000	Which by the way, hi chat room, chat.orangelsauce.com
231000	232000	Saying that's not true
232000	233000	It's on IMDB
233000	234000	Is it?
234000	235000	Yeah
235000	236000	Credited on IMDB
236000	239000	I thought some producer said it wasn't true, IDK
239000	241000	Well, I mean, you know
241000	242000	Alright, there you go
242000	244000	Well, if it's on IMDB, I guess it's true
244000	246000	You know what?
246000	249000	The Matrix 2 and 3 still sucked
249000	251000	Boy or girl directing
251000	252000	Yes
252000	254000	Alright, let's talk about video games
254000	256000	Of course, we do that here on the show
256000	258000	Chat.orangelsauceradio.com
258000	261000	If you're listening to us live on this Sunday night at All Games Radio
261000	263000	We do tape live at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern
263000	266000	Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at allgames.com
266000	267000	So join us in our chat room
267000	270000	To get to the chat room, chat.orangelsauceradio.com
270000	271000	Have I plugged all the websites?
271000	272000	I believe so
272000	276000	Twitter, OLR, Facebook, Orangelsauce Radio, etc, etc
276000	277000	Now we can talk about games
277000	278000	Hi Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?
278000	279000	Hi
279000	280000	I played a lot of Dragon Age 2
280000	285000	I borrowed it from my friend's husband
285000	286000	Well, he's my friend too
286000	287000	But I borrowed his game
287000	288000	And it's really fun
288000	290000	And I'm kind of hooked
290000	292000	And I played some WoW
292000	295000	And some Final Fantasy 3
295000	300000	And then I looked at games at Fry's with U2
300000	301000	Yes
301000	302000	That was it
302000	304000	We went shopping last night and not for shoes
304000	305000	I didn't buy anything
305000	309000	I know, it's kind of sad to go to a huge electronics store like Fry's
309000	311000	Which, I don't think they have those everywhere
311000	312000	I think just on the west coast
312000	315000	So Fry's is just like, it's an uber electronics store
315000	316000	I think they're spread around
316000	318000	Yeah, there might be a few in other places
318000	320000	But yeah, it's an uber electronics store
320000	322000	Huge games section, huge computer section
322000	323000	We went in there, looked around
323000	324000	Didn't buy anything
324000	325000	It's kind of sad
325000	327000	Their PSP section amazed me
327000	328000	They do have a lot
328000	329000	That still exists
329000	332000	Well, there's still a lot of good stuff coming on the PSP
332000	333000	The UMD's
333000	336000	Yeah, the UMD's were what impressed me too
336000	338000	That they're still really supporting them
338000	340000	$10 for most of them
340000	342000	Because they got them really cheap, I'm sure
342000	344000	I guess so, I don't know
344000	347000	You know, there's only one company still supporting UMD
347000	348000	And that's Sony
348000	349000	Of course
349000	352000	I don't remember the last movie
352000	355000	I want to say 2012 was one of the last movies to come out for it
355000	357000	Zira, they are kick-ass
357000	358000	Whatever came out last
358000	360000	No, I know I was looking and I was like
360000	363000	Oh, Charlie's Angels Full Throttle is only $4
363000	366000	And they have like 40 copies of it sitting on the shelf
366000	369000	That's kind of the sad thing is that sometimes Fry's just way over stocks
369000	371000	A certain game or something
371000	373000	I'll tell you what else they had just hundreds
373000	374000	I'm not even lying
374000	376000	Hundreds of copies of just trying to get rid of them
376000	378000	Castlevania Lords of Shadow
378000	379000	Because it sucks
379000	381000	The new God of War-y Castlevania
381000	383000	Because they're fucking cutthroat with their goddamn vendors
383000	386000	Every time the vendors come out and stuff
386000	388000	And we get to talking about different customers
388000	390000	They're talking about visiting Fry's
390000	392000	They fucking hate visiting Fry's
392000	394000	Because Fry's, they're just cutthroat
394000	395000	They want everything
395000	397000	And it's just, it's ridiculous
397000	400000	They're like, I hate fucking going and visiting Fry's
400000	403000	SolarFlare's in our chatroom at chat.org.com saying
403000	406000	I've lived on the west coast for over 20 years and have never seen a Fry's
406000	408000	Maybe they don't have them in Oregon
408000	409000	I don't think they do, Oregon or Washington
409000	410000	I'm not sure where SolarFlare's is
410000	412000	But I think they're mostly like
412000	414000	I know there's a few in the bay, some in SoCal
414000	416000	There are some in Texas, I know that
416000	418000	I think they dip into Arizona and the southwest a little bit
418000	421000	So I think they go south and west, not north and west, sadly
421000	423000	So, alright, anyhow
423000	425000	Uh, Loki
425000	427000	Wait, wait, I want to go back to Dark Soccer and talk more about Dragon Age 2
427000	429000	Because I haven't played the game
429000	431000	So you're enjoying Dragon Age 2?
431000	433000	Yes, it has Eve Miles doing a voice
433000	436000	For anyone who does not know, she was Gwen on Torchwood
436000	438000	Now you didn't really play the first game, right?
438000	439000	No
439000	440000	And you're doing okay with the second game?
440000	441000	Yeah, just fine
441000	443000	What is it that you like so much about it?
443000	444000	Lesbians
444000	446000	Have you...
446000	447000	Did you draw that?
447000	449000	Not really
449000	451000	Have you actually gotten to the part where they, you know
451000	453000	Well, right now Meryl the elf
453000	455000	Is gushing over my character
455000	457000	Which is kind of cute and funny
457000	459000	Because my character is all like face tats
459000	461000	And red eyeshadows, she's really fierce looking
461000	463000	And she's a rogue
463000	465000	And, uh
465000	468000	But they've already had, like, love chat
468000	470000	And then there's this one guy who was hitting on my character
470000	472000	I was like, no you're gross
472000	474000	But he was apparently from an earlier game
474000	476000	He's the one that you give him a cat called Sir Pouncealot
476000	478000	I guess
478000	480000	He was talking about his cat
480000	482000	And then there's Isabella
482000	484000	Who's, according to Tiara
484000	486000	She's a slut
486000	488000	She can sleep with her a bunch
488000	490000	And then she's like, oh, it's just sex
490000	492000	So, I'm like, I haven't gotten to any fun part though
492000	494000	I mean, I've done a lot of
494000	496000	I really like this game, but it's not fun
496000	497000	No
497000	499000	It's kind of what I just heard, it's just me
499000	501000	I've done a lot of killing
501000	502000	Which is great
502000	504000	And I've got it in extra gore mode
504000	506000	So, like, they're covered in blood
506000	508000	When you're done with a fight
508000	510000	And they're battered on their face
510000	512000	And then I was like, that's awesome
512000	514000	Okay, gore and lesbians, got it
514000	516000	This game really isn't fun
516000	518000	I'm just here for the pussy
518000	520000	And gore
520000	522000	It actually is really fun
522000	524000	I'm still in the first act
524000	526000	Okay, you're like in the grind or something, right?
526000	528000	Yeah
528000	530000	Trying to grind out that pussy
530000	532000	Well, some elven cooch
532000	534000	Say no more
534000	536000	What's the battle system like?
536000	538000	It's like you run down
538000	540000	The stairs, oh no, there's people there
540000	542000	And one of your party comments
542000	544000	About how there shouldn't be people on the street after dark
544000	546000	And then you have to kill them
546000	548000	And there's blood everywhere
548000	550000	And you occasionally
550000	552000	No, they're like highwaymen
552000	554000	And you can go outside of the town
554000	556000	To certain areas
556000	558000	And you'll find piles of bones
558000	560000	And you can dig through them for loot
560000	562000	I see
562000	564000	It's really great though
564000	566000	And, okay, I guess
566000	568000	So now you're talking about touching bones
568000	570000	In your quest for pussy
570000	572000	My quest for pussy
572000	574000	No, it's
574000	576000	There's also, you know, you can go through people's stuff
576000	578000	And right now I'm actually trying to build up my character
578000	580000	So I can get the lock picking
580000	582000	So I can open locked
582000	584000	Trunks and stuff and steal people's stuff
584000	586000	And
586000	588000	What else was I doing?
588000	590000	There's just, I'm doing
590000	592000	A lot of the side quests too
592000	594000	So I can level up before I get to the
594000	596000	The big thing
596000	598000	But there's somewhere else that I need
598000	600000	To go to get some dude named Fenris
600000	602000	Who was, I think, in one of the last games
602000	604000	Now it's gonna be a three way
604000	606000	Well, no, I don't
606000	608000	Okay, Meryl
608000	610000	Is my fangirlism because
610000	612000	I adore Eve Miles
612000	614000	She's very cool
614000	616000	And Welsh accents to me are hot
616000	618000	Really hot
618000	620000	Alright
620000	622000	And I don't
624000	626000	The elves that live outside
626000	628000	Are all Welsh
628000	630000	The elves and humans that live in the town
630000	632000	Are all British
632000	634000	And dwarves are American
634000	636000	Is what I'm getting so far
636000	638000	Whereas, you know, don't we usually
638000	640000	Have dwarves being Scottish?
640000	642000	Well, if you play WoW a lot, yeah, dwarves are Scottish
642000	644000	Or, you know, Lord of the Rings
644000	646000	Well, no, he sounded vaguely
646000	648000	He didn't, he sounded Welsh
648000	650000	Alright, well, you think you'll play Dragon Age 2
650000	652000	Through to completion?
652000	654000	Yeah. Alright, that's good
654000	656000	It's always good to finish. I'll take pictures
656000	658000	Of the lesbian scene. Alright, please do
658000	660000	Alright, let's move on over to Loki
660000	662000	Loki, how was your gaming week? Um, it was okay
662000	664000	I played Motorstorm Apocalypse
664000	666000	Through rookie mode now
666000	668000	And I think most of the way through
668000	670000	Pro mode
670000	672000	Although, it's like, all the races have been
672000	674000	Somewhat difficult up until now
674000	676000	And it's just like
676000	678000	And now it's really, really hard
678000	680000	So, I'm actually stuck on one
680000	682000	Race right now
682000	684000	But, really enjoying it still
684000	686000	Storyline's still really cheesy
686000	688000	But, still
688000	690000	Pretty fun game
690000	692000	And then, I've been playing
692000	694000	On my 3DS
694000	696000	Really only pilot wings right now
696000	698000	And I haven't really played any of the
698000	700000	Like, I don't know
700000	702000	The missions or whatever you have to do
702000	704000	Different challenges
704000	706000	Mainly the free-flying
706000	708000	Which is kind of annoying a little bit
708000	710000	Because you can only fly around for like
710000	712000	A few minutes at a time
712000	714000	Which is so
714000	716000	Stupid
716000	718000	It's like 3 minutes at a time
718000	720000	Fun!
720000	722000	Well, I mean, you do only have a limited amount of fuel, right?
722000	724000	Well, okay
724000	726000	If you want to go by that route
726000	728000	Then why can't I have it
728000	730000	Where I refuel, or
730000	732000	Gas is expensive, you know
732000	734000	Or, like, when I'm using the rocket belt
734000	736000	I never get low on fuel
736000	738000	I could hold that fuel
738000	740000	You know, the throttle down the whole way
740000	742000	And it just never would run out of fuel
742000	744000	But, um
744000	746000	I'm basically collecting these markers
746000	748000	Or whatever they're in the game
748000	750000	And I have 74 of 75 of them
750000	752000	So, I'm still trying to find the last one
752000	754000	But, it's just like
754000	756000	You know, the Wuhu Island thing
756000	758000	It's like
758000	760000	Oh, hey, look at this
760000	762000	This is from Wii Sports Resort
762000	764000	Oh, this is the part where you can, uh
764000	766000	Here's the bowling alley, here's all this stuff from the game
766000	768000	I'm like, okay, well none of this has to do with
768000	770000	Flying
770000	772000	Can you, like, crash through the roof of the bowling alley?
772000	774000	No, you can't
774000	776000	How boring!
776000	778000	You can fly through tunnels and stuff
778000	780000	You know, it's kind of cool jogging around
780000	782000	I guess in Wii Sports Resort or something
782000	784000	Well, actually, no it wouldn't be
784000	786000	Because you'd be jogging in place and that's really boring
786000	788000	But, um, I could see
788000	790000	If you're into jogging in place, what the appeal
790000	792000	Might be, um
792000	794000	But, it's just
794000	796000	It seems really lazy to me
796000	798000	I mean, they could have just easily created
798000	800000	A new island, it's not that damn
800000	802000	Detailed at all, I mean
802000	804000	Somebody could easily create an island within
804000	806000	A day
806000	808000	I mean, there's no animations
808000	810000	Whatsoever going around, there's no
810000	812000	Cars moving around, no people running around
812000	814000	It's just all
814000	816000	Not doing anything
816000	818000	It seems to be like a dark pilot wings
818000	820000	Where you can, like, rocket belt into the bowling alley
820000	822000	And steal a baby and, like, run away with it
822000	824000	Or, you know
824000	826000	Yeah, see, once again
826000	828000	And this is unfortunate
828000	830000	This goes back to Nintendo
830000	832000	What they do with new games
832000	834000	Or, I should say, games that they put out again
834000	836000	They basically take them
836000	838000	They don't add any features to it
838000	840000	And they strip it down to what the bare essentials
840000	842000	That they need to do another release for
842000	844000	It's just like all the Animal Crossing games
844000	846000	And here's the problem
846000	848000	People like us keep buying them
848000	850000	And so it teaches them
850000	852000	Actually, you're the only one that's bought a 3DS in this room
852000	854000	No, I'm talking about Animal Crossing
854000	856000	Oh, okay
856000	858000	No, I'm just saying, uh, it's people like us
858000	860000	That keep buying those crappy games
860000	862000	And it just gives them the impression
862000	864000	Okay, so we don't really do anything
864000	866000	People just still buy our games
866000	868000	It's just like the whole Tron thing
868000	870000	What's different this year?
870000	872000	We put a 12 on the box
872000	874000	I mean, it's okay
874000	876000	It's somewhat fun
876000	878000	I haven't played through everything yet
878000	880000	But, you know, you're looking at
880000	882000	What was on the original Super Nintendo
882000	884000	Version, it's just
884000	886000	I'm sorry, it's even less content than that
886000	888000	I mean, you really couldn't
888000	890000	You know, bother to
890000	892000	Put the extra content in there
892000	894000	They don't even remove the landing pads
894000	896000	And stuff like that, they're in the different missions and stuff
896000	898000	They're in the free mode, they're just all sitting there
898000	900000	Still, because they didn't bother to
900000	902000	Even say, okay, well, during this mode
902000	904000	This isn't here, or whatever
904000	906000	It's just, it's always there
906000	908000	Let me get you some questions from our chat room
908000	910000	At chat.orangesonshooter.com
910000	912000	Robert M. is asking, Loki, Loki, can you shoot in pilot wings?
912000	914000	No balloon popping, at least?
914000	916000	There's a few levels in the mission mode
916000	918000	Where you can do that
918000	920000	Shooting or balloon popping? Or both?
920000	922000	Both
922000	924000	Let's see, TigerClaw is asking, what they should have done
924000	926000	Is recreated that helicopter mission from the first pilot wings
926000	928000	Most people never even saw those missions
928000	930000	The first pilot wings was hard
930000	932000	Well, they've got some stuff that's
932000	934000	Undocumented
934000	936000	Or whatever, it's not on the box
936000	938000	Where they have the squirrel suit
938000	940000	Or whatever, you could do skydiving in there
940000	942000	Wait, the squirrel suit?
942000	944000	Yeah, like a flying squirrel suit
944000	946000	It's not really a squirrel suit
946000	948000	It's like, have you seen those
948000	950000	Skydiving things that they've got the webbing
950000	952000	Between your arm and your body
952000	954000	And the leg and your body
954000	956000	So it provides more drag so you can fly around
956000	958000	When we're talking about a flying squirrel
958000	960000	I'm thinking of Rocky from the Rocky and Bowling Cool show
960000	962000	No, it's not like some stupid Mario
962000	964000	Thing where you're in a tanooki suit
964000	966000	Or some crap like that
966000	968000	I'm literally imagining a
968000	970000	Skydiving squirrel
970000	972000	That trick never works
972000	974000	I'd pay to play that
974000	976000	But it's just
976000	978000	I don't know
978000	980000	It's a fun game
980000	982000	I guess, it's what I've been playing
982000	984000	Just because I just wanted to play
984000	986000	Through some of that
986000	988000	I've played Ridge Racer a ton
988000	990000	Street Fighter, it's alright
990000	992000	I saw a question about the battery life
992000	994000	Earlier in chat
994000	996000	And that's a bitch I've heard
996000	998000	The battery life isn't really that great
998000	1000000	On these things
1000000	1002000	I haven't really had a problem with it
1002000	1004000	Because I keep charging it all the time
1004000	1006000	I've never had it run out on me
1006000	1008000	But then again, I also
1008000	1010000	Don't leave it in sleep mode
1010000	1012000	Because I figured that the battery would go dead
1012000	1014000	And I kind of want to play the game
1014000	1016000	That's the thing, they have all these things that rely on sleep mode
1016000	1018000	And I know that doesn't suck
1018000	1020000	As much battery as playing a game would
1020000	1022000	But, you know, if it's
1022000	1024000	Running out of battery that fast
1024000	1026000	Why rely on sleep mode for all this stuff?
1026000	1028000	Let me go to another
1028000	1030000	Question from chat, and I think this is a good one
1030000	1032000	Savalas in our chat room is asking
1032000	1034000	At chat.org.com
1034000	1036000	Loki, do you have buyer's remorse with buying the
1036000	1038000	Nintendo 3DS now that we're a week in?
1038000	1040000	No, not really
1040000	1042000	I mean, I got the few games that I wanted to get
1042000	1044000	And that's it, and that's what I'm gonna plan on
1044000	1046000	Getting until
1046000	1048000	You know, whenever the next best game comes out
1048000	1050000	I mean, there's the
1050000	1052000	Dream Trigger game that I'm thinking about getting
1052000	1054000	Whenever the hell that comes out, and
1054000	1056000	That's pretty much it, I mean
1056000	1058000	Everything else is gonna be fourth quarter, so
1058000	1060000	I'm perfectly fine with what I have right now
1060000	1062000	That's why I didn't purposely go
1062000	1064000	And just buy all the stuff that came out launched
1064000	1066000	Because a lot of it's crap
1066000	1068000	And a lot of it, you know, even the reviewers go
1068000	1070000	This is basically the game that
1070000	1072000	Came up before, but now it's in 3D
1072000	1074000	And it doesn't really utilize 3D that much
1074000	1076000	And you're gonna get a lot of that stuff
1076000	1078000	Because people don't know how to utilize it
1078000	1080000	Or they're gonna try to cash in real quick
1080000	1082000	Especially putting out a budget game
1082000	1084000	Because all the games are $40
1084000	1086000	So a $20 game stands out because, hey, that's much cheaper
1086000	1088000	But
1088000	1090000	You get what you pay for? Exactly, yeah
1090000	1092000	Alright
1092000	1094000	And then what else did I play? Oh, Game Dev Story
1094000	1096000	But still playing a little bit of that
1096000	1098000	That's kind of mindless because
1098000	1100000	My team is so good at developing
1100000	1102000	Stuff that
1102000	1104000	I mean, we beat out everybody in the awards
1104000	1106000	And all that stuff, it's kind of fun
1106000	1108000	Even the fictional company
1108000	1110000	That's the game publisher
1110000	1112000	Of the actual game
1112000	1114000	Their
1114000	1116000	Toilet system is not
1116000	1118000	Doing well compared to
1118000	1120000	Compared to my glory hole system
1120000	1122000	Yes, that's what it's called, the glory hole
1122000	1124000	Kay
1124000	1126000	Everybody loves the glory hole
1126000	1128000	Alright
1128000	1130000	And then Cry Theft Auto
1130000	1132000	That's what I played this week
1132000	1134000	Alright, let me go over to SalaciousPop
1134000	1136000	How was your gaming week? It was alright
1136000	1138000	Pretty slow
1138000	1140000	Played some Pac-Man Championship Edition DX
1140000	1142000	Some Super Street Fighter IV
1142000	1144000	A lot of the
1144000	1146000	Mortal Kombat
1146000	1148000	PS3 demo
1148000	1150000	And I finally got to play Marvel vs. Capcom 3
1150000	1152000	What did you think of MVC 3?
1152000	1154000	I really liked what I saw of it
1154000	1156000	Definitely want to get it at some point
1156000	1158000	It has the sort of hybrid
1158000	1160000	Four button controls that
1160000	1162000	The Dreamcast used for
1162000	1164000	Marvel vs. Capcom 2
1164000	1166000	And then I guess also Tatsunoko vs. Capcom
1166000	1168000	For the Wii uses something similar
1168000	1170000	And I didn't realize that it played like that
1170000	1172000	So when I was using a six button
1172000	1174000	Fight pad
1174000	1176000	I wasn't quite landing the combos
1176000	1178000	That I thought I was because I realized
1178000	1180000	Oh, well not all the buttons are mapped the way I thought they were
1180000	1182000	There's no low, medium, strong
1182000	1184000	Punch, low, medium, strong kick
1184000	1186000	They're kind of combined
1186000	1188000	Some of them
1188000	1190000	So yeah, I loved it
1190000	1192000	Was there a particular character you really enjoyed?
1192000	1194000	I don't
1194000	1196000	Really care for her
1196000	1198000	In the context that she appears
1198000	1200000	In the Marvel universe
1200000	1202000	The female Wolverine
1202000	1204000	Clone, X-23 I think her name is
1204000	1206000	She was fun to use
1206000	1208000	Cool
1208000	1210000	Anything else you want to share about your game a week?
1210000	1212000	Um
1212000	1214000	The fatalities in the
1214000	1216000	Mortal Kombat demo
1216000	1218000	Are really gory but they're all kind of stupid
1218000	1220000	And they're all kind of the same
1220000	1222000	You think? Yeah
1222000	1224000	See, here's my whole thing
1224000	1226000	You know I hate the Saw movies and all that stuff
1226000	1228000	And I talk about this on the show
1228000	1230000	But yet I giggle so much at Mortal Kombat
1230000	1232000	And all the fatalities
1232000	1234000	And some of them are really bad
1234000	1236000	Like the Melina one, what does Melina do?
1236000	1238000	She walks up to you like she's going to kiss you
1238000	1240000	And then she
1240000	1242000	Sucks you up and spits you out
1242000	1244000	No it's not like you think that's what's going to happen
1244000	1246000	But she like rips off your face
1246000	1248000	She throws her thighs at you
1248000	1250000	So they're out of your rib cage
1250000	1252000	So you're all spiked
1252000	1254000	And then she makes like this
1254000	1256000	I guess Melina's always horny or whatever
1256000	1258000	She's always moaning and cooing
1258000	1260000	So it looks like she's going to kiss you
1260000	1262000	And then she rips your head off at the jawline
1262000	1264000	So that your chin and jaw
1264000	1266000	Is still attached and your body falls over
1266000	1268000	Then she eats your tongue
1268000	1270000	Out of the head that she has in her hand
1270000	1272000	She doesn't just eat it, she goes
1272000	1274000	Like it's sushi
1274000	1276000	She's got Baraka face
1276000	1278000	And then so she eats your tongue out of your
1278000	1280000	Sort of severed head and then she just chucks it to the ground
1280000	1282000	Like a football, like eh
1282000	1284000	And then she jumps on the camera
1284000	1286000	And like kind of tries to dry hump it
1286000	1288000	Right? Well that's if you're
1288000	1290000	That's her non, like if you don't do a fatality
1290000	1292000	You just let them fall down
1292000	1294000	And then she like smears blood on her boobs
1294000	1296000	Because again she's always horny
1296000	1298000	Like I don't know what her problem is
1298000	1300000	I bet yet the whole time I see this
1300000	1302000	For the first time I'm giggling maniacally
1302000	1304000	And like Alan's like what's wrong with you
1304000	1306000	And as soon as, I know I don't really appreciate
1306000	1308000	The whole TNA fighter game thing at all
1308000	1310000	Because as soon as I saw her buck naked outfit
1310000	1312000	I'm like she's going to get a yeast infection
1312000	1314000	In that onesie
1314000	1316000	She has a naked outfit?
1316000	1318000	She's not really naked
1318000	1320000	She's wearing floss
1320000	1322000	She's wearing floss
1322000	1324000	And the best part
1324000	1326000	Is that this new Mortal Kombat
1326000	1328000	Game, the blood kind of seems to stay
1328000	1330000	On the characters and it stays like
1330000	1332000	In kind of natural looking ways
1332000	1334000	So after she's fighting or whatever, her boobs will be like
1334000	1336000	Covered in blood and she's like rubbing her boobs
1336000	1338000	It's all like, it's really
1338000	1340000	Disgusting but funny
1340000	1342000	It's just a PS3 demo
1342000	1344000	It's not the game yet
1344000	1346000	Because the demo has four characters in it
1346000	1348000	And the fatality for Scorpion
1348000	1350000	If you look it up in the off menu
1350000	1352000	Is wrong
1352000	1354000	The fatality for Scorpion was just backwards
1354000	1356000	That was funny
1356000	1358000	Actually wait, hold on
1358000	1360000	You know what I should do here
1360000	1362000	Is I should actually just pull this up real quick
1362000	1364000	It is a three hour show, we have time to do some fun things here
1364000	1366000	Describe Scorpion's fatality for us real quick
1366000	1368000	Because that was pretty funny too
1368000	1370000	He takes his katana
1370000	1372000	And he slices your head off
1372000	1374000	And then again at the waist
1374000	1376000	But he does it so fast
1376000	1378000	Obviously it's going through you but you're still upright
1378000	1380000	And then he kicks
1380000	1382000	Your stomach
1382000	1384000	So your middle piece flies back
1384000	1386000	So then your legs fall
1386000	1388000	And your head goes up in the air and then he cuts your head
1388000	1390000	In half like a cantaloupe
1392000	1394000	Well I love the
1394000	1396000	Fruit ninja reference there
1396000	1398000	Okay, here you go Dark Soccer, you ready?
1398000	1406000	Here you go, enjoy!
1406000	1408000	See she's all sexy walking
1408000	1410000	And then give me a kiss boy
1410000	1412000	Sike
1418000	1420000	See and then she's all like rubbing her boobs
1420000	1422000	She's all mmm I just ate that guy's tongue
1422000	1428000	That's the best fatality ever
1428000	1430000	There you go
1430000	1432000	See, I gotta admit
1432000	1434000	I gave the demo an unfavorable review a couple weeks ago
1434000	1436000	It is growing on me a little bit
1436000	1438000	It's growing on me just a little bit
1438000	1440000	I think having seen some more of the fatalities
1440000	1442000	And getting to do
1442000	1444000	Like kind of getting more comfortable with the fighting system
1444000	1446000	Because you know they took out the whole weapon thing
1446000	1448000	And all that's gone now
1448000	1450000	So it's a little bit back to old school
1450000	1452000	And you know kind of getting used to that again
1452000	1454000	It's growing on me, I think I will get the full version
1454000	1456000	So I can do more fatalities
1456000	1460000	And Salacious Pop can be very disappointed with me
1460000	1462000	And I have one other thing to add to my gaming week
1462000	1464000	So when I was
1464000	1466000	After I downloaded the Mortal Kombat demo for PS3
1466000	1468000	I noticed there was a new Castlevania
1468000	1470000	And there have been so many Castlevania releases in the last two years
1470000	1472000	I was just like oh I'll get this whatever it is
1472000	1474000	And it's the one that just came out within the last month
1474000	1476000	What's it, we were just talking about it
1476000	1478000	What's the name, it's Castlevania
1478000	1480000	Lords of Shadow
1480000	1482000	Yeah, I played maybe ten minutes of it
1482000	1484000	And I was like okay well this is just them
1484000	1486000	Trying to be God of War
1486000	1488000	And for some reason
1488000	1490000	I don't want to say that it hurt to look at
1490000	1492000	Like it didn't give me a headache
1492000	1494000	But just running around
1494000	1496000	Something was off about the graphics visually
1496000	1498000	It was hard to look at, I don't know
1498000	1500000	But I was like okay this is God of War, Castlevania
1500000	1502000	And I just deleted it
1502000	1504000	It originally wasn't a Castlevania game
1504000	1506000	Oh yeah that's right it wasn't supposed to be a Castlevania game originally
1506000	1508000	It's a new IP when we can just slap Castlevania on it
1508000	1510000	There you go
1510000	1512000	sj100matt is in our chat room talking about the Mortal Kombat demo
1512000	1514000	And the fatality is saying
1514000	1516000	Rob you should show your mom the game
1516000	1518000	Rob that's gross, Rob
1518000	1520000	Actually that's a great idea for a future
1520000	1522000	OLR YouTube
1522000	1524000	She looks cold, she needs a jacket
1524000	1526000	We will get right on that
1526000	1528000	That sounds like a great future OLR YouTube
1528000	1530000	Is Rob's mom plays Mortal Kombat
1530000	1532000	It'll be fine, good times
1532000	1534000	Alright let's see my gaming week
1534000	1536000	There was some stuff that Salacious Pop did
1536000	1538000	But there was some different things
1538000	1540000	One night randomly we were having You Don't Know Jack
1540000	1542000	Which has kind of become this strange Friday tradition
1542000	1544000	All of a sudden which I'm kind of liking
1544000	1546000	Friday night playing You Don't Know Jack and drinking wine
1546000	1548000	I think you need stronger booze
1548000	1550000	But yeah the booze in You Don't Know Jack is good
1550000	1552000	Wine keeps it classy
1552000	1554000	Yes wine keeps it very classy
1554000	1556000	With the fart jokes in You Don't Know Jack
1556000	1558000	Which is always hilarious
1558000	1560000	But then we just started playing old school games
1560000	1562000	And when I say old school I mean like
1562000	1564000	Old school on the Xbox Live Arcade
1564000	1566000	And some things they don't even sell anymore
1566000	1568000	We were playing Smash TV
1568000	1572000	We were playing the Mortal Kombat 3 Ultimate
1572000	1574000	The arcade one that's on
1574000	1576000	Or was on Xbox Live that's not there anymore
1576000	1578000	So we were kind of having fun just playing some of those old games
1578000	1582000	And it's neat because you can kind of see how far along
1582000	1584000	The Xbox Live Arcade really has come
1584000	1586000	I mean it really was just a bunch of ports in the beginning
1586000	1588000	And some of them weren't done very well
1588000	1590000	Looking back, now going back and playing
1590000	1592000	The Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 I'm kind of like
1592000	1594000	Well where's the move list in the game?
1594000	1596000	Or where's you know anything
1596000	1598000	It's just literally the ROM
1598000	1600000	Just dumped and sold on Xbox Live Arcade
1600000	1602000	So they have come a ways
1602000	1604000	A little bit since then
1604000	1606000	And you know I think back to some of the episodes
1606000	1608000	We were doing back then and I seem to remember
1608000	1610000	We were complaining about that a lot
1610000	1612000	That a lot of the releases were just ROMs being dumped
1612000	1614000	On Xbox Live Arcade and I think Microsoft tried to fix that
1614000	1616000	After the first year or two
1616000	1618000	They said okay no more of that
1618000	1620000	That's a feature
1620000	1622000	Well excuse me princess
1622000	1624000	Not entirely the arcade
1624000	1626000	No I get what you're saying though
1626000	1628000	Yeah well remember we were playing Mortal Kombat 3
1628000	1630000	And for some reason
1630000	1632000	I could remember Kabal combos
1632000	1634000	Kabal was the character I used to use in Mortal Kombat all the time
1634000	1636000	And I remember how to make him do the spinny thing
1636000	1638000	And then punch punch uppercut
1638000	1640000	Little laser purple pew pew beam
1640000	1642000	I could do all that still
1642000	1644000	Yet when it came to fatality time I couldn't remember how to do it
1644000	1646000	So I'm like well let me pause and go to the move list
1646000	1648000	Let's just pause and reconfigure the buttons
1648000	1650000	Or quit
1650000	1652000	So we had to go on GameFAQs to get the fatality
1652000	1654000	But then we were like too lazy to do it
1654000	1656000	Let's just play something else
1656000	1658000	Let's play Smash GV
1658000	1660000	I will say one new game I played this week
1660000	1664000	I played a free game that's now available on the Playstation 3
1664000	1666000	Called Free Realms
1666000	1670000	Free Realms is a free MMO
1670000	1672000	That is available on the Playstation 3
1672000	1674000	And that's what they're calling it
1674000	1676000	It's a what?
1676000	1678000	A freemium MMO
1678000	1680000	And you download this 25 meg file
1680000	1682000	And first I was like oh shit this thing's small
1682000	1684000	This is a small game
1684000	1686000	Alright so I launch the game
1686000	1688000	Only to wait and download 700 more megabytes
1688000	1690000	So I'm like fine
1690000	1692000	It's Playstation home
1692000	1694000	So I'll go in the other room and play WoW and then come back in an hour
1694000	1696000	So finally I get in there and it's like choose your character
1696000	1698000	And you can do little character customizations
1698000	1700000	You chose this character
1700000	1702000	And I don't need to download that character
1702000	1704000	No that was the last time I downloaded
1704000	1706000	But you can either be a male or female
1706000	1708000	And you can be a human or you can be a fairy
1708000	1710000	So of course I rolled a man fairy
1710000	1714000	Because I figured nobody was going to be playing those in the game
1714000	1716000	So it would be kind of funny
1716000	1718000	And don't you dare be making jokes
1718000	1720000	Because I'll beat you
1720000	1722000	Alright so anyway
1722000	1724000	I rolled the character
1724000	1726000	You can do a custom name
1726000	1728000	But if you do a custom name then it has to go to be approved
1728000	1732000	So you have to choose a name from this slot machine thing
1732000	1734000	They have all these pre-approved names
1734000	1736000	A first name like a middle name and a last name
1736000	1742000	I think my name ended up being like Rob like Forest Tree or something
1742000	1744000	I don't remember something really dumb
1744000	1746000	So I went in there whatever
1746000	1748000	And then it's just okay
1748000	1750000	Now you're in free realms have fun
1750000	1752000	No tutorial no setup
1752000	1754000	No nothing just
1754000	1756000	Okay here you are
1756000	1758000	No tutorial? What is this?
1758000	1760000	A paid game?
1760000	1762000	So I was like okay well I kind of figured it out I think
1762000	1766000	Like I went around and figured out how to start mining
1766000	1768000	And I was like okay I'm going to mine
1768000	1770000	So the mining game is kind of like
1770000	1772000	I don't know it's like
1772000	1774000	Bejeweled but not really
1774000	1776000	Imagine if the point of Bejeweled was not to swap tiles
1776000	1778000	But instead you drew lines
1778000	1780000	That matched all the colors that were in a row
1780000	1782000	And you had to do like three or more
1782000	1784000	There's a game like that on Gaia
1784000	1786000	That's the mining game
1786000	1788000	It sounds like puzzle quest 2 when you have to pick lock a chest
1788000	1790000	Or bash open a door there's a sort of
1790000	1792000	Jewel game
1792000	1794000	It's different
1794000	1796000	I guess they just put out puzzle pirates on consoles
1796000	1798000	I mean seriously
1798000	1800000	That's an old school game I miss that game
1800000	1802000	That was actually a really rad MMO I want to go back and check that out
1802000	1804000	Anyway this is about free realms you be quiet
1804000	1806000	So I did that and whatever
1806000	1808000	So I was doing the quests
1808000	1810000	And I noticed that in the quests
1810000	1812000	If you did not want to try to find
1812000	1814000	The NPC that's the next step of the quest
1814000	1816000	You could just hit R2
1816000	1818000	And your character would just auto fly there
1818000	1820000	I fly because I'm a fairy
1820000	1822000	You just auto fly there or whatever
1822000	1824000	And okay so I made it really easy
1824000	1826000	So I kind of figured it out
1826000	1828000	This MMO is really for kids
1828000	1830000	It's a kids MMO
1830000	1832000	How many people were wandering around like
1832000	1834000	LOL want to buy gold or whatever
1834000	1836000	Nobody was really talking
1836000	1838000	You could see other real people
1838000	1840000	Yeah I guess
1840000	1842000	Do you have a player or do you have pre-determined things
1842000	1844000	That you have to say because it is
1844000	1846000	I don't know I didn't try to chat
1846000	1848000	I don't want to talk to these people
1848000	1850000	I just want to figure out what the game is
1850000	1852000	So I gathered
1852000	1854000	It is a bunch of minigames
1854000	1856000	Thrown together to make an MMO
1856000	1858000	I don't know if you saw
1858000	1860000	There's something called penguin defense
1860000	1862000	I love penguins it's like a tower defense game
1862000	1864000	And then there's basically every
1864000	1866000	Facebook-y puzzle game
1866000	1868000	99 cent iPhone game is somewhere in here
1868000	1870000	Which is one of the crafting types
1870000	1872000	I don't know if you saw but the guy
1872000	1874000	That you know I guess is
1874000	1876000	The head of
1876000	1878000	The team that made this game or whatever
1878000	1880000	Is like saying well our game is actually
1880000	1882000	Really really similar to
1882000	1884000	Minecraft I'm like
1884000	1886000	What? No it was nothing like Minecraft
1886000	1888000	Really? But apparently like the house building
1888000	1890000	Or some crap in there is
1890000	1892000	Similar to Minecraft but not
1892000	1894000	You can customize your house but it
1894000	1896000	Struck me a little more Animal Crossing than it is in Minecraft
1896000	1898000	It's not Minecraft he's just stupid
1898000	1900000	Well and here's the other thing folks
1900000	1902000	Once I got to like the 4th
1902000	1904000	Level of mining it was like
1904000	1906000	Do you want to play more mining?
1906000	1908000	Become a member today of free realm
1908000	1910000	So that was it
1910000	1912000	So essentially this MMO is just all these
1912000	1914000	Little minigames but you can play all the minigames
1914000	1916000	Up to level 4 and then it's like
1916000	1918000	Oh you gotta be a member
1918000	1920000	So it's sodium 1? Yeah basically
1920000	1922000	So I'm sorry that's not a
1922000	1924000	Free MMO
1924000	1926000	A demo of a pay MMO
1926000	1928000	This is another
1928000	1930000	Instance of a game company using deceptive
1930000	1932000	Terms to market their product
1932000	1934000	Because a lot of people are probably going to check this out because it's a free MMO
1934000	1936000	And I'm here to tell you it is not a free MMO
1936000	1938000	It is a demo
1938000	1940000	Of an MMO and I know what their defense
1940000	1942000	Would be is that well
1942000	1944000	Once you capital you can still
1944000	1946000	Be in the world and you can still talk to
1946000	1948000	People and you can still customize your fairy
1948000	1950000	And to their defense
1950000	1952000	And I hate going to their defense but
1952000	1954000	Their defense is actually
1954000	1956000	A pretty cheap MMO
1956000	1958000	$35 for a lifetime membership
1958000	1960000	But once again
1960000	1962000	Why would you want to do that?
1962000	1964000	Pay 99 cents and get the same games
1964000	1966000	On the iPhone it's really the same deal
1966000	1968000	$35 for a lifetime membership but there's no reason
1968000	1970000	To believe the longevity would be
1970000	1972000	More than 2 years before they shut the servers
1972000	1974000	Down because no one's going to play it
1974000	1976000	Here's the thing
1976000	1978000	I will give it this credit
1978000	1980000	I thought it was kind of dopey
1980000	1982000	Maybe twice and I was like okay I think I've done
1982000	1984000	Everything there is to do in this game
1984000	1986000	I see it more like a kids MMO
1986000	1988000	I think that's where they've obviously
1988000	1990000	Taken a lot of safety precautions
1990000	1992000	A lot of it's kind of watered down
1992000	1994000	I think this is something more for kids
1994000	1996000	But here is where they screwed it royally
1996000	1998000	There's no tutorial
1998000	2000000	There's nothing to kind of help you
2000000	2002000	Understand what you're supposed to do in this game
2002000	2004000	And I think a lot of kids
2004000	2006000	Would get really frustrated with it
2006000	2008000	I think this would really have to be
2008000	2010000	I think there's a very specific age range
2010000	2013000	It's probably like 10 to 13 year old girls
2013000	2015000	I think would enjoy Free Realms
2015000	2017000	And maybe some boys but I don't know
2017000	2020000	It just strikes me as more of a girly game
2020000	2021000	Because there's not a lot of violence
2021000	2023000	And yes I'm being totally sexist right now
2023000	2024000	But that's really it
2024000	2026000	It's more of a tween game
2026000	2028000	Like I could see the Jonas Brothers
2028000	2030000	And Justin Bieber showing up here
2030000	2032000	That's what Free Realms struck me as
2032000	2034000	So that was it
2034000	2036000	That was Free Realms
2036000	2038000	It's free so I guess if you want to check it out
2038000	2040000	Go for it but I think you'll get bored of it
2040000	2043000	You just totally made me think of a good porn star name
2043000	2044000	What's that?
2044000	2046000	Justine Beaver
2046000	2048000	Probably already
2048000	2049000	There probably is one
2049000	2051000	Because I thought you said Justin Beaver
2051000	2053000	And I knew you said Bieber
2053000	2055000	But then it made me think of how I was calling him Justine
2055000	2057000	And then Justine Beaver
2057000	2060000	Going to our chatroom at chat.orangelaungeradio.com
2060000	2062000	Robert M in our chat says
2062000	2064000	I assume Free Realms is the same on the PC
2064000	2066000	As far as the Freemium model
2066000	2067000	I think so
2067000	2068000	Yes
2068000	2069000	Okay
2069000	2071000	I wasn't really motivated to go check
2071000	2072000	You'll have to excuse me
2072000	2074000	I think this is not necessarily
2074000	2076000	Granted it's a way
2076000	2078000	I think it's going to get a lot of exposure to people
2078000	2080000	That might not normally try it
2080000	2082000	Because it's integrated with the PlayStation Network
2082000	2086000	And it's technically free to start playing it
2086000	2090000	But it can also be used as kind of data for them
2090000	2093000	Because they're working on a new EverQuest
2093000	2095000	They're working on some other
2095000	2097000	I forget what else
2097000	2099000	There's another IP that they're working on
2099000	2100000	A sequel for
2100000	2101000	That's also an MMO
2101000	2104000	But it'll work on this to see what works
2104000	2105000	What doesn't work
2105000	2106000	And it's a good way
2106000	2108000	Imagine if EverQuest came out the next one
2108000	2112000	As a free to play type of game
2112000	2113000	Or something like that
2113000	2115000	That might have a lot of appeal
2115000	2117000	Here's the other kind of interesting thing
2117000	2118000	I just want to throw out there
2118000	2120000	As long as we're talking about MMOs on consoles
2120000	2122000	Because there really haven't been a lot of successful ones
2122000	2124000	DC Universe to be determined
2124000	2126000	Obviously that one's kind of still new
2126000	2128000	Home
2128000	2130000	Despite all the smack
2130000	2131000	I'm talking about Free Realms
2131000	2133000	I felt there was more to do in Free Realms
2133000	2135000	Than there was to do in Home
2135000	2137000	I kind of felt like the effort that was spent
2137000	2138000	Making Free Realms
2138000	2139000	Would have been better spent
2139000	2140000	Putting minigames into Home
2140000	2141000	Or making Home
2141000	2143000	Have more of a game element to it
2143000	2144000	I get that Home
2144000	2147000	I guess is supposed to be a little more about multimedia
2147000	2148000	And I don't know
2148000	2150000	Maybe more about the chatting and so forth
2150000	2151000	Whatever
2151000	2153000	I kind of felt like
2153000	2155000	There was at least some point to Free Realms
2155000	2158000	Even if it was one I did not care to delve into further
2158000	2159000	Than Home
2159000	2160000	Where you log in and it's kind of like
2160000	2162000	If there's not a new world to go explore for five minutes
2162000	2164000	You're kind of like LOL bored by
2164000	2166000	You know?
2166000	2167000	So I don't know
2167000	2169000	It strikes me as odd that
2169000	2171000	And I realize it's a different development team
2171000	2172000	Sony's a huge company
2172000	2174000	And Free Realms already existed in some regard on the PC
2174000	2176000	So I mean
2176000	2178000	It just seems weird to me that Home
2178000	2179000	After all these years
2179000	2181000	Still I don't see the point of logging in
2181000	2183000	To Home regularly
2183000	2185000	There's nothing for me to really check every day
2185000	2187000	I don't know
2187000	2188000	Anyhow
2188000	2189000	That was my gaming week
2189000	2191000	Talked a lot about Free Realms
2191000	2193000	And some of the other minigames
2193000	2195000	Are there plans or something like that in Free Realms?
2195000	2197000	I think they have guilds
2197000	2199000	But I wouldn't know the first thing
2199000	2201000	Can you invite the people to your house?
2201000	2203000	Your guild members to your house?
2203000	2205000	Honestly Loki I didn't play that far
2205000	2206000	You probably can
2206000	2208000	And that's more people that can come to your house
2208000	2209000	And fucking Home!
2209000	2210000	Awesome!
2210000	2211000	Way to go Sony!
2211000	2212000	Bravo!
2212000	2214000	I am confident in saying though
2214000	2216000	That if there are TVs in Free Realms
2216000	2218000	You can't put videos or pictures on them
2218000	2219000	Just like Home
2219000	2221000	I'm pretty confident in saying that
2221000	2222000	So
2222000	2224000	That still doesn't matter
2224000	2226000	If no one can see them
2226000	2228000	Only so many people can come to your house
2228000	2229000	Sorry sorry
2229000	2231000	If we have any more people in this house
2231000	2233000	It's gonna violate the fire code
2233000	2235000	And the marshal's gonna come down here
2235000	2237000	We don't want any of that stuff
2237000	2238000	You know what I mean?
2238000	2239000	Just
2239000	2241000	Don't want to mess with that
2241000	2242000	Alright let's move on
2242000	2244000	We're gonna get into some actual video game news here
2244000	2245000	Of course our chatroom
2245000	2246000	chat.orangelaunchy.com
2246000	2248000	If you want to join us live on this Sunday evening
2248000	2250000	Real quick housekeeping
2250000	2253000	I may not be here in a couple weeks
2253000	2255000	So we may have a guest host in a couple weeks
2255000	2256000	I don't know I've talked to the other hosts about that
2256000	2258000	I'm not gonna be here in a couple weeks
2258000	2259000	Which week's that?
2259000	2260000	Is that the 17th?
2260000	2261000	Yes
2261000	2263000	Maybe we're not gonna be here at all that week
2263000	2264000	Where are you gonna be?
2264000	2265000	I'm not gonna be anywhere
2265000	2266000	But my wife's gonna be somewhere
2266000	2267000	Okay gotcha
2267000	2268000	She's going to a wedding
2268000	2272000	Well then I'm gonna safely say we are probably not gonna be here at all on the 17th
2272000	2273000	Which is in two weeks
2273000	2275000	Because that is also the night I need to be out
2275000	2277000	I am going in for Mensa testing though on the 16th
2277000	2278000	Which is pretty awesome
2278000	2279000	Mensa testing?
2279000	2280000	Yes Mensa testing
2280000	2281000	What?
2281000	2282000	Okay I have to know more about this
2282000	2283000	Why are you taking the Mensa test?
2283000	2284000	It's fun
2284000	2288000	Did you just sit there and you were just kind of like watching the Food Network
2288000	2289000	And then suddenly it just dawns on you?
2289000	2290000	I should take the Mensa test
2290000	2292000	I don't even remember what it was
2292000	2295000	Somehow I got directed to the test that's on their website
2295000	2296000	And I did really well on that
2296000	2299000	And I've been playing around with their iPhone app
2299000	2301000	And I was just like eh you know this is all good and all
2301000	2304000	But I want to actually try the real test
2304000	2308000	And I mean even just looking at what questions
2308000	2311000	I mean obviously the questions in the app aren't necessarily the same questions
2311000	2313000	But they have the similar types of questions
2313000	2316000	I don't see how it's really a valid IQ test
2316000	2321000	Because you really only have to be good at answering certain types of questions
2321000	2322000	And that's it
2322000	2323000	Only you Loki
2323000	2324000	This is so typical of you on the show
2324000	2327000	You're openly questioning why anyone would want to become a Mensa member
2327000	2329000	Yet you're scheduled to take the test
2329000	2331000	No I just want it I just want you know hey
2331000	2334000	Listen I just want to try it just for the hell of it
2334000	2337000	And you know hey if I if I'm accepted into it
2337000	2339000	Great that's something else to put on my resume
2339000	2343000	Whatever it doesn't matter
2343000	2344000	I want to take the Mensa test
2344000	2345000	You should
2345000	2347000	It's 40 bucks
2347000	2349000	40 bucks you got to go to a there's a guy
2349000	2351000	That's how much brain age costs right?
2351000	2353000	There's a guy does it once a month down in Dixon
2353000	2355000	And you just go down there and you go take the test
2355000	2358000	It's an hour and a half and that's it
2358000	2361000	I don't think Rob should take it
2361000	2363000	Why? Because then I'm gonna fail and I'm gonna cry
2363000	2364000	Is that why?
2364000	2371000	If you pass whatever sort of weird totally irrational opinion you ever have in your life
2371000	2372000	Politically or for anything else
2372000	2376000	Well I'm a member of Mensa so I think maybe that my opinion
2376000	2377000	Listen all you got to be
2377000	2379000	Is a bit more important than yours
2379000	2380000	All you have to be good at
2380000	2383000	I mean it's seriously it's mostly math and it's mostly pattern finding
2383000	2388000	So if you can find patterns and kind of think little you know a little bit out of the box I guess
2388000	2391000	That's it you'll be fine
2391000	2396000	And once again I still don't understand how it's really a valid
2396000	2399000	Whatever though I'll take it I'll take the test
2399000	2404000	I probably won't you know quality because you have to be in the 98th percentile of the United States
2404000	2407000	In order to you know be accepted in there
2407000	2410000	So I'd assume that's probably close to getting everything correctly
2410000	2415000	Many years ago I went on a date with a guy who was in Mensa and he had the magazine on his table
2415000	2419000	Like you know it was one of those like you know coffee table discussion pieces
2419000	2420000	I always thought
2420000	2425000	Well okay let me put it this way like if you join Mensa and stuff they have a bunch of different functions to get out
2425000	2426000	Nothing sounded interesting at all
2426000	2428000	Is there like a Mensa prom?
2428000	2433000	I don't know about that they have dating though like a dating thing you can date other Mensa members
2433000	2441000	It's stupid but it'd be cool to put on like you know to get the little you know award or whatever the hell they have
2441000	2446000	They're all hey you've been accepted in you know that'd be kind of cool but you know beyond
2446000	2450000	Do I really want to be like a functioning member? Fuck that
2450000	2452000	I want to be a member of that society
2452000	2455000	Well now are you gonna get excommunicated from Mensa if any of the members here at this program?
2455000	2458000	Eh no
2458000	2463000	Well I've had um I've used to get letters all the time to go take the test
2463000	2467000	I never wanted to do it because I thought it was stupid and pretentious
2467000	2469000	All these fucking smart people I'm just sitting here going
2469000	2474000	If you can bring your Mensa card to like Coldstone and get a buck off it's like yeah hell yeah
2474000	2479000	Free side of pancakes at Denny's because fucking Mensa card hell yeah
2479000	2480000	Smart people got it going on
2480000	2482000	Yeah is Mensa like AAA will they come change my tire?
2482000	2486000	I think it's like AAA
2486000	2489000	I don't know so we'll see we'll see what ends up happening there
2489000	2497000	I probably won't pass it I mean because there's there's a certain type of question from from playing the game
2497000	2500000	There's a certain type of question that stumps me usually
2500000	2503000	It's because it's a lot of it and they only do certain types
2503000	2509000	It's a few rows of numbers and at the very end there's you know there's four rows of four
2509000	2513000	And you're supposed to figure out what the pattern is between all of them
2513000	2518000	And a lot of it has to do okay well it's this number times this number with the digits reversed added together
2518000	2523000	You know minus this times this and you're supposed to figure it out basically you have a minute of questions
2523000	2528000	So you have to figure out this really ridiculous you know pattern in that time
2528000	2533000	And a lot of times I'm unable to do it really quickly
2533000	2537000	Although I've gone back though and actually looked at some of these and go okay so that's how they're doing it
2537000	2541000	And you find you know I don't know if it's breaking the test or anything
2541000	2544000	And you find there's certain patterns to the way they ask questions and stuff
2544000	2549000	And okay I got to look for these types of things up there it is and way you go
2549000	2555000	So I don't know it's it just sounds interesting a challenge or something I don't know
2555000	2558000	Well I'm busy this month but if you if you go next month let me know I'll go
2558000	2560000	Yeah it's on the 16th this month
2560000	2562000	Wow that's a horrible day I can't do that day
2562000	2563000	Okay
2563000	2566000	Maybe next month all right Randy's in our chat room at chat.orangelandraday.com
2566000	2571000	And says sky at the Mensa test this is like brain age right this is me at the Mensa test
2571000	2574000	Red, yellow, blue
2574000	2575000	It's really
2575000	2576000	Blue
2576000	2577000	A big
2577000	2578000	Bro
2578000	2579000	It's really a big IQ test
2579000	2580000	Yeah
2580000	2581000	That's all it is
2581000	2584000	I know I wasn't gifted and talented when I was a kid that counts for something right
2584000	2586000	Right
2586000	2587000	Yeah
2587000	2589000	I can get a dollar off at Coldstone right all right
2589000	2593000	Akuma JP in our chat room says just show them your boobs and that's it pass
2593000	2595000	I don't I don't know if that would work
2595000	2596000	Yeah
2596000	2602000	I don't think that's how it works all right anyhow let's move on actually get into some gaming news tonight
2602000	2603000	All right
2603000	2608000	Mensa talk was way better than talking about the Twitter and the Facebook and all that
2608000	2613000	I can just picture our mailbag now though filling up with emails you don't understand Mensa you're very rude
2613000	2620000	No I understand it completely I'm just you know I want to become a member but I want to become a
2620000	2622000	You just want a gold star next to your name
2622000	2628000	Okay I want to become a non-participating member of Mensa is that is that too much to ask
2628000	2634000	I just want to be on the roster I don't necessarily want to go to the meetings I don't want to attend some Mensa conference
2634000	2640000	Don't care I don't care about talking about political issues I just want the damn you know badge or whatever
2640000	2641000	Just put it on your resume
2641000	2642000	Exactly
2642000	2644000	All right how about gaming news video games hello
2644000	2652000	All right well I guess I should be sad about this but uh Mega Man universe has been canceled
2652000	2660000	That's right it's the game that was basically kind of a remade Mega Man 2 with some customizable characters
2660000	2668000	And user created levels and really didn't look that great in my opinion but some people were really gung-ho about it
2668000	2678000	It's canceled too bad so sad their decision I guess was caused by various circumstances that's such a detailed explanation
2678000	2688000	And of course they're saying that maybe that has to do with the departure of the Mega Man creator and you know the universe lead designer Kenji Inafune
2688000	2704000	So I don't know it it just looked like Mega Man powered up just you know on PC or whatever Xbox Live Arcade now with like ooh it's character Mega Man you know
2704000	2708000	Interesting idea but I mean they could
2708000	2717000	It looked interesting to me so of course I'm a little bit disappointed that it got canceled but at the same time if the game really did suck then they did the right thing
2717000	2725000	You know and it's tough to say that because you know I'm excited about the prospect of a new Mega Man game but even I have to admit it was a little weird when they had that trailer with Ryu in it
2725000	2730000	And like you know suddenly the other Capcom characters are in Mega Man universe it's like what the fuck is this game
2730000	2738000	No it would have been cool though if they had all that stuff but see here's my problem is it's basically remade Mega Man they had remade Mega Man 2 levels
2738000	2747000	If it's Mega Man universe it should be all the fucking games all of the levels all of the bosses you know something like that where you can have your customized character but you're fighting
2747000	2755000	You know how I don't even know how many you know boss characters it would be but just like you know almost a hundred you know different characters
2755000	2763000	Well remember when we only knew the title and nothing else that's what most people were speculating it was is that oh Mega Man universe is finally gonna be that clusterfuck game
2763000	2771000	Yeah it would be really awesome like okay well let's see what you know this weapon does to this character from a different game you know and stuff like that
2771000	2781000	I mean it actually if I remember correctly I think Mega Man 2 did have that kind of in when you're going through the Wily stages where they have the old you know one characters and you have to figure out what weapons did what
2781000	2790000	I don't believe the one character's ever showed up in two it's the two characters showed up in three you had to replay the stages in the corner stages in three I remember that it's weird
2790000	2802000	Got it okay I was close anyways but yeah something like that it's just they're not gonna do that because because he just it's like giving away too much I guess
2802000	2812000	Oh well too bad not coming out but we're still getting Mega Man Legends 3 right yeah it's still be supposed to be coming out of that 3DS at some point
2812000	2819000	One reason to own a 3DS I suppose I am very looking forward to that Legends was awesome
2819000	2826000	Alright well some news going on with the Xbox there is a new dashboard apparently on the way and there's a preview that was being rolled out
2826000	2835000	Major Nelson had put out the call on his blog that there is going to be another Xbox 360 I guess beta test if you will they call it a preview program it's basically a beta test
2835000	2841000	Where you know they did this a little while ago with the new experience I think they did it again with the new Netflix and all that
2841000	2853000	Yeah I did it last time when they have that and I didn't do it this time for a couple reasons well mainly because I hated having to update my system all the damn time
2853000	2860000	Because it would be like oh you got another update oh you got another update and you know all these updates rolling out a few times a day and it was annoying
2860000	2869000	And seriously not worth my getting a copy of Halo Reach even if it is in this new format and I am kind of curious to see what the new format is
2869000	2872000	I don't know it's just not really worth it
2872000	2879000	Well what's also interesting about this beta test program everybody is getting a free copy of Halo Reach with it so you know there is definitely something in it for folks here
2879000	2885000	And the reason why it's coming with Halo Reach is because there is a new disk format that's basically being beta tested with this whole thing
2885000	2895000	And that you know a lot of people are kind of assuming oh well this is to basically prevent copy you know don't copy that floppy and the piracy all that stuff this is there to update that
2895000	2901000	And that is probably true that's a big part of this as well but apparently there is something else going on
2901000	2909000	This is from a website called Digital Foundry apparently saying that the new disk format that Microsoft is going to put in this new Xbox update
2909000	2916000	It's going to give an extra gigabyte of the disk back so they are basically creating a new gig of space on the disk
2916000	2921000	I don't know if that's like maybe using the outside layer or maybe some type of copy protection they were using
2921000	2925000	They had a video partition or something like that or a certain partition that was in there
2925000	2932000	Actually it was kind of weird I think it was either the security partition or like the video partition
2932000	2939000	Here it is there was over a gigabyte dedicated to a DVD video partition that also contained anti-piracy security sectors
2939000	2945000	So that is going to be drastically reduced or admitted completely so it will free up more space on the disk
2945000	2951000	What this will mean in the immediate future I don't know but it does mean an extra gig can be packed in
2951000	2957000	That would only seem to really affect I mean I don't know like a lot of RPGs that go beyond a disk have just gone multi-disk
2957000	2959000	Like Lost Odyssey had fucking four disks
2959000	2965000	Yeah but there is certain games that maybe because it is really expensive to put out multi-disk games
2965000	2972000	For games that are getting close to that and they have to compress all their stuff or they have to cut out things because there is not room on a single disk
2972000	2977000	Or whatever it is that they are trying to put out this way it gives them at least an extra gig of space to work with
2977000	2984000	And not every company fills up at this completely so it would make sense and really they could get rid of that stupid video partition
2984000	2995000	Because who cares? Okay so I pop this in my DVD player because I am an idiot and it comes up with some Xbox logo
2995000	2996000	That doesn't say that this is
2996000	3001000	Oh is that what happens? I have never thought to put an Xbox 360 disk in a regular DVD player
3001000	3007000	So it is that video partition and so it will go oh this is an Xbox disk you have to play it in your Xbox 360
3007000	3010000	Well how about you just don't do that and then all it will do is it can't re-disk
3010000	3012000	Or just have a picture
3012000	3015000	Hey idiot this is for an Xbox 360, bye
3015000	3017000	It could just be a static picture
3017000	3021000	Well it pretty much is a picture I am surprised that it takes a gigabyte of space for that
3021000	3025000	I mean it seems like an awful lot for just a little picture
3025000	3033000	SSJ100Matt in our chatroom at chat.orangelandradi.com is asking so will these free copies of Halo Reach go towards its overall sales numbers
3033000	3039000	Think maybe throwing back a little bit to when they were giving Guitar Hero Van Halen free with Guitar Hero 5 remember that
3039000	3044000	Yes but it doesn't really matter at this point anyways because I mean the sales of it has probably dropped quite a bit
3044000	3048000	SolarFlare in our chatroom says it will still be behind Blu-Ray though, interesting point
3048000	3056000	You know that is one thing that holds the Xbox 360 back a little bit you know we do have a lot of companies that want to port their games to both systems
3056000	3063000	So I bet there's a lot of games out there on the PS3 that aren't really realizing their full potential of Blu-Ray
3063000	3068000	And this will not just help the 360 games expand but I think it will help the PS3 ports expand too right
3068000	3080000	No I mean a little bit maybe but I don't really think it's going to make a huge difference because if those companies are holding back their ports just because of space issues
3080000	3088000	Or if they're porting it to multiple systems using the same assets then it's not a huge deal I don't think
3088000	3095000	If they really wanted to they could just uncompress everything for the Blu-Ray but with Blu-Ray the whole problem was that it's slow
3095000	3105000	Especially that data on the inside is really slow compared to the stuff on the edge of the disk
3105000	3114000	So it's just I don't know I don't think it's going to make a huge difference there's not a lot of games that utilize all the space on there as well
3114000	3122000	Let me close on this question here for this story, SolarFlare in our chatroom asks are they trying to make time to having to break out the next gen console
3122000	3127000	You know we have noticed a lot of in this generation of games and you know part of it you can blame on the recession
3127000	3133000	Part of it is this whole 10 year cycle or whatever they're talking about but you have noticed that especially the 360 has had its life extended
3133000	3139000	A couple times here with Kinect and now maybe this is another step to try and breathe another year or two into it
3139000	3145000	It probably is just to help the developers out a little bit because you know there's space issues with you know what's on the disk
3145000	3152000	And it's it's just probably something they looked at and go do we really need this no okay let's get rid of it then we can free up all the space for our developers
3152000	3157000	I'm sure they would dig that so you know that's probably what it's all about
3157000	3163000	Alright well let's move on with some more news I think DarkSakura has some more Xbox news for us
3163000	3171000	I do if I don't drop my mic this actually has to do with the live indie games issue on Xbox live about the ratings
3171000	3177000	You know we had said that we had a feeling of the ratings were kind of fixed you know that they might have been manipulated
3177000	3188000	And it turns out that it actually might be the XNA creators club excuse me actually tweeted that and I quote
3188000	3195000	We are investigating a possible misuse of ratings on XBLG titles will announce more information here as it develops
3195000	3204000	So basically it's been coming to people's attention that ratings have gone from you know really high to just dropping drastically
3204000	3207000	And so they're fairly certain that there's manipulation behind it
3207000	3218000	So is the most so if the fraud is true is it being used to bolster the ratings of games that maybe are terrible or to lower stuff that competitors don't get by
3218000	3226000	It wasn't necessarily that they were being well they were being manipulated but it wasn't by the whim of a certain publisher
3226000	3232000	Basically it was that one lacrosse game that was on there they tweeted their fellows hey give us a five star rating
3232000	3238000	Well the people that are fans of the game also took it upon themselves to rate the other games one star that were in the area
3238000	3251000	So they you know inadvertently created like you know ratings fixing almost but it's just because there's no real system in place to where you have to purchase the game in order to rate it
3251000	3252000	And that kind of stuff
3252000	3254000	Oh yeah I guess that's true
3254000	3255000	So you can just rate it regardless
3255000	3261000	Yeah it seems to be highly unfair that someone should be able to rate something that they haven't played so
3261000	3269000	Yeah because I thought that you you know spent your one to three bucks or your two to four hundred whatever microsoft space bucks
3269000	3276000	I'm like wow this is terrible and then you can give it two stars after you've at least played the demo or bought it but I guess not
3276000	3277000	Yeah
3277000	3278000	You can just do what you want
3278000	3283000	Well they're looking into it apparently so maybe they'll realize that was one big oversight
3283000	3290000	To be honest doesn't iTunes have that same problem I mean I could go in and rate podcasts to one that I've never listened to
3290000	3296000	Well not with the apps I think that you're given I think you can only rate them after you've used them
3296000	3297000	Perhaps
3297000	3300000	I know that if you delete an app it asks you to rate it
3300000	3301000	Yeah
3301000	3302000	So
3302000	3305000	Which by the way you should leave Orange Knobs Radio a five star review on iTunes
3305000	3306000	Do it
3306000	3311000	Yes we actually had a couple nice ones this past week so thank you guys for doing that really appreciate it
3311000	3318000	That kind of stuff does help because when we get more five star reviews on iTunes it kind of like bumps you up in the listing and you know just helps us get more exposure
3318000	3321000	Add more people to our chat room and make it a bigger party on Sunday nights
3321000	3324000	We need to be as exposed as Malina's boobs
3324000	3325000	If not more so
3325000	3326000	Yeah
3326000	3328000	That's right alright moving on Loki
3328000	3329000	Yeah
3329000	3334000	Oh by the way the people doing this total dicks I forgot to say that earlier
3334000	3343000	Another cancellation story this isn't a big surprise because this has been delayed forever and I remember playing it back a couple
3343000	3352000	God how many E3's ago was that that I actually played this but Sony online entertainment has confirmed that they have cancelled the agency
3352000	3354000	It will not be coming out
3357000	3365000	You know it was delayed forever it was a spy MMO kind of a cool little game but oh well
3365000	3371000	Man I'm just keeping sad trombone open in a window tonight because there's a lot of just cancellation news
3371000	3387000	Kind of alluding to what I was talking about before when we were talking about Free Realms they're also saying that the company is discontinuing production of the title to focus on developing resources on delivering two new MMOs based on its renowned PlanetSide and EverQuest properties
3387000	3398000	Which while also maintaining its current portfolio of online games so you know maybe a new free to play you know EverQuest because
3398000	3403000	I'm surprised just a straight up port of the first EverQuest game hasn't shown up on PS3 yet
3403000	3408000	Because there's still shit tons of people playing old school EverQuest there's what like 20 something expansions it's crazy
3408000	3411000	But you know people invested a lot in that game
3411000	3419000	It's the same reason that it's so important what Blizzard does next with their next MMO because you know this titan thing or whatever it is they're doing
3419000	3426000	They have to be very careful because they don't want to cannibalize wow but they might you know it's weird
3426000	3431000	I got an email a couple weeks ago from Ultima Online which I think I demoed way back in the day
3431000	3440000	So you know yeah new loyalty mount for like as if you have a concurrent subscription like City of Heroes does that for how long you've been paying for the game
3440000	3443000	For Ultima Online when did that come out?
3443000	3446000	I was one of the first MMOs period
3446000	3450000	It was probably like 99 it was a long time ago
3450000	3455000	Yeah it was like 12 or 13 year loyalty mount
3455000	3462000	Okay yeah so if they're still around then so is the EverQuest people yeah
3462000	3470000	Boy oh boy that is and yeah I think it's when you invest so much time into something it's hard to walk away from it
3470000	3478000	And for me that's a lot of wow it's hard for me I was really interested in DC Universe but I've been having a hard time saying I'm gonna really invest this time in DC Universe
3478000	3482000	Because all my friends are on wow this is tough
3482000	3484000	Just type a slash played and see
3484000	3493000	Oh cry all right Spassinator in our chat room says the agency being canceled how the flying fuck can anyone not see that coming
3493000	3500000	Well I don't know I don't know if I would say I saw it coming I did notice it was an awfully long development cycle
3500000	3507000	But MMOs on consoles have just become so unpredictable like and most of the news is really bad
3507000	3514000	And I don't like what are they doing wrong why why do consoles just seem to not be able to get MMOs
3514000	3521000	The lone exception being probably DC Universe maybe Final Fantasy 11 but that game is a little old now
3521000	3526000	So what is it about consoles that MMOs just aren't fucking working
3526000	3536000	I think that games on consoles are more serialized that they have a beginning and an end even if it's a God of War or an RPG that takes 80 hours to beat
3536000	3542000	You get to the ending you play it again you get the alternate ending and you're done and you move on to the next title
3542000	3549000	Console games is all about how much I want to say like it like it's an assembly line of just how many games you can churn through in a certain amount of time
3549000	3553000	But you know you you buy certain amount of games in a year and you want to get through them all
3553000	3558000	Whereas an MMO is really open-ended you never get to the end of wow
3558000	3565000	And that's sort of the culture or the attitude that piece that more is more appropriate for PCs if that makes sense
3565000	3576000	I'm with you to a point but then I ask what about Halo where it thrives on it's at least you know the older games especially to thrived on online
3576000	3580000	Which didn't really have a beginning in the end maybe maybe a match had a beginning and an end I don't know
3580000	3583000	Well yeah those are broken up into matches
3583000	3590000	Because I guess sports are somehow different and Halo is kind of like a sport IDK
3590000	3597000	Yeah I don't know Game Guru in our chat room flat out says because it is not wow
3597000	3604000	I don't know you know as much you know I'm a big supporter of wow although I don't always agree with everything Blizzard does
3604000	3611000	But you know I think there's room for more than one you know a game like DC Universe I don't think it's a failure
3611000	3614000	I don't know how that game has been selling I think it's been doing okay
3614000	3620000	But right now okay in the console universe is better than anything else right now
3620000	3621000	Than nokay?
3621000	3622000	Yeah than nokay
3622000	3627000	Eve Online is still kicking doesn't have wow's numbers but it's definitely got its market share
3627000	3628000	There's people still doing Perfect World
3628000	3630000	Final Fantasy 11 still has supporters
3630000	3631000	Guild Wars
3631000	3637000	Shit Ultima Online and EverQuest still have lots of people to play
3637000	3639000	Lineage 2 still a fucking huge game
3639000	3641000	That's really big in Korea
3641000	3642000	Yeah just not here in the US
3642000	3651000	So let's see going to our chat room again Brad from Pod Culture says wouldn't Phantasy Star Online count kinda
3651000	3658000	Well I thought it was cool that Sega actually let people transfer their characters to private servers
3658000	3665000	That was cool and so it was like well we have to close it but I know there's still people doing it
3665000	3668000	And there was Phantasy Star Universe was going on
3668000	3672000	Yeah true but Phantasy Star Universe I don't think was ever
3672000	3673000	I know people who are still playing it
3673000	3674000	Really? I just wouldn't think
3674000	3676000	Although by people I mean Julie
3676000	3677000	One person
3677000	3683000	Phantasy Star Online back in the Dreamcast especially and don't get me wrong I love Phantasy Star Online my god
3683000	3690000	It really just kinda like set the tone I think in a way for MMOs and I think a lot of MMOs wouldn't exist today if it wasn't for PSO
3690000	3692000	I love PSO
3692000	3696000	I don't know like in a way PSO isn't even really an MMO to me
3696000	3700000	No it's more like you run these rooms okay you're done
3700000	3701000	Yeah
3701000	3703000	You hang out with your friends making weird emoticons
3703000	3704000	Yeah
3704000	3705000	And then you dance
3705000	3709000	PSO always felt a lot like Diablo to me for some weird reason
3709000	3711000	The whole random dungeon crawling
3711000	3716000	I actually I really started liking PSO when I started playing online
3716000	3718000	I'm sorry on the computer
3718000	3724000	You know what I think really hurt PSO you know what really really hurt that franchise more than anything I think
3724000	3725000	PSU
3725000	3729000	No I would say it was before that I would say it was the GameCube game
3729000	3735000	Because Nintendo just aborted online support
3735000	3745000	Literally told Sega sure we'll help you out with this you know MMO thing and put out this broadband adapter or anything and then Nintendo just basically said ah fuck it
3745000	3746000	LOLJK
3746000	3752000	No here's what I think was even worse the Dreamcast version in the US no online play
3752000	3756000	You had to do this little thing to manipulate it to get it to play online
3756000	3759000	Because it wouldn't support the broadband adapter
3759000	3762000	Yeah I imported that or I did something where
3762000	3764000	Yeah I could play the Dreamcast one online
3764000	3765000	I had the ethernet
3765000	3766000	I had the modem though
3766000	3772000	Well no we had that too it was it was like it was something that you had to manipulate in the menu
3772000	3778000	The DNS I think or that your IP you had to put in something to force it to go out through the ethernet
3778000	3779000	Yeah
3779000	3780000	You had to do something to it to get it to work
3780000	3785000	I don't remember having that problem I just remember it working ah whatever it's been so long
3785000	3795000	Well I guess and also going back to the agency thematically a spy MMO I don't know something about MMOs is you have to even in fantasy star online you're not killing literal dragons
3795000	3801000	But it's whimsical fantasy sci-fi you know no one wants to get together with their five friends and smuggle microfiche
3801000	3807000	Matrix online ended anything that I've noticed well the city of heroes is still going Star Trek online is still going strong
3807000	3811000	I love Star Trek online in fact I need to pay for a month but
3811000	3815000	Yeah I don't I don't think MMO has to be swords and dragons and mystical stuff
3815000	3816000	It has to be fantasy
3816000	3824000	Yeah it's just I think the other that's a tried and true method that's an established formula that's a formula that's working right now
3824000	3827000	That's WoW's formula in a way I think
3827000	3829000	But now they have goblins with motorcycles
3829000	3837000	I think we haven't really seen the other type but then again Eve online is not is a space game DC Universe not really dragons
3837000	3844000	Star Trek online totally different thing but Star Trek's a whole separate fandom too you know like
3844000	3854000	Well and the fact that they're getting so much right in Star Trek online they're really playing to continuity fans and sort of getting
3854000	3860000	I mean I hated enterprise but they are incorporating the better parts of enterprise into the game
3860000	3868000	And it's got something for the fans that's the big thing is that the people that are playing Star Trek online are Star Trek fans
3868000	3874000	Alright let's move on from MMO chat we're running a little long because of MMO chat let's do some other quick stories here
3874000	3880000	I got a story about GameStop and GameStop apparently has bought absorbed some more companies
3880000	3887000	They bought spawn labs and they've also bought a company called impulse now what the hell did these things do
3887000	3898000	Okay spawn labs they did this high def box set that apparently I guess it sounds to me a lot like the whole online system
3898000	3903000	It's kind of similar to that so that's you know one thing they've absorbed and then they also got impulse
3903000	3910000	Which apparently is going to have three parts to it which is the client the impulse client which you can use to download games
3910000	3915000	The reactor which is like DRM management and copy protection and all of that
3915000	3920000	Letting the developers do achievement friends list and all the kind of like steam xbox
3920000	3921000	Sounds like a steam clone
3921000	3926000	And then impulse publisher which is real time reporting and management tools
3926000	3933000	GameStop has bought these companies so in a way I sort of see this as them thinking ahead a little bit
3933000	3940000	Because these companies have more to do with online distribution and something that isn't so much the stores
3940000	3945000	You know they did not buy stores in this acquisition well they did but it's a different type you know
3945000	3950000	So I have a feeling they are thinking ahead as to this whole how do we counter digital distribution
3950000	3952000	They're absorbing more and more into their collective
3952000	3958000	A little bit yes but you know it doesn't mean all the mall stores are going to shut down next week
3958000	3964000	But I don't know this digital distribution thing if I was kind of in this GameStop industry I'd be a little freaked out right now
3964000	3969000	Well maybe not right this second but you know five years from now this could be
3969000	3973000	Just makes me think of Blockbuster and Netflix when Netflix first came out
3973000	3978000	Is this you know Johnny come lately by mail oh who's going to use that
3978000	3985000	Blockbuster hopped on that bandwagon but they did it too late but I think they hopped on it early enough to save them past Hollywood's demise
3985000	3990000	Right so I feel like GameStop you know and again I don't mean to like panic people or whatever this is years away
3990000	3995000	You know these things happening but GameStop buying this I think they're trying to kind of put themselves in a position
3995000	4000000	Where they are like Blockbuster got in on it early that's what this seems like to me
4000000	4001000	They're setting up a safety net
4001000	4002000	Yeah
4002000	4009000	That we know because if I don't have any details because I really don't think I know any more store managers
4009000	4015000	But from what I've noticed I'll go into a GameStop you know and it'll be dead empty
4015000	4020000	There'll be no one in there and I think that it's just first of all a sign of the economy and another thing
4020000	4026000	And this this is actually I'm not going to go into it because it's a little bit more on the cycle psychology level
4026000	4033000	But I think that people are becoming more isolated wanting to do more things from home
4033000	4037000	Not wanting to go out amongst people you know what I mean
4037000	4044000	That that's why online services have become so popular you know people need to get out of the house
4044000	4049000	See I have to play devil's advocate here though a little bit the one by his house in South San Francisco always packed
4049000	4051000	The one in that mall what is that mall called?
4051000	4052000	Well yeah but that's in the mall
4052000	4053000	ceremony
4053000	4054000	I'm talking about strip mall places
4054000	4055000	Oh okay
4055000	4056000	They're dead
4056000	4058000	I don't really go to a lot of those yeah
4058000	4062000	Well Dan will randomly let's go buy this store number because he knows all the store numbers
4062000	4063000	Uh-huh
4063000	4068000	I'll be like okay well which one's that oh it's the one over here then why didn't you just say that was the one over there
4068000	4069000	So
4069000	4073000	Let's see go into our chat I'm going to chat on orangeontraday.com
4073000	4076000	SolarFlare says they're going to have to do some good stuff to compete with steam
4076000	4081000	I think that's what part of all this is is to really align themselves in a way where they can
4081000	4089000	Maybe they'll start doing this thing in the store where you know buy the copy in the store and get some type of digital download thing
4089000	4093000	The free costume or you know something extra maybe that's kind of where they're going
4093000	4094000	We'll see
4094000	4097000	All right moving on dark soccer what do you got for us
4097000	4100000	Well we have some news out of Japan
4100000	4103000	Oh which is where video games come from
4103000	4112000	Oh and it's a new Super Mario Brothers Wii arcade cabinet that's being developed by Capcom
4112000	4117000	Yeah it's Super Mario Brothers Wii Coin World
4117000	4122000	It's a four player game where you earn medals by participating in mini games so kind of
4122000	4123000	It's Mario Party
4123000	4127000	Kind of Mario Party-ish I say ish
4127000	4129000	Not too much running and jumping
4129000	4136000	And it actually is on Capcom of Japan's website there's a trailer and everything
4136000	4141000	And I'm just like why is Capcom doing it but then again Capcom is
4141000	4146000	Nintendo hasn't ever really been much in the arcade scene except for the play choice
4146000	4148000	Oh that was years ago though
4148000	4150000	Arcades are not even the same thing now
4150000	4155000	In fact I more think this is news worthy as oh arcade games are still popular somewhere in the world
4155000	4159000	But I think it's actually neat that they've got that relationship with Capcom to do it
4159000	4162000	Because Capcom does put out good quality
4162000	4166000	Who did the Mario Kart sit down driver game that's at
4166000	4170000	Namco because you can play as Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man in that
4170000	4171000	All right yes I thought
4171000	4173000	So yeah Namco did that
4173000	4176000	So yeah it's not totally unheard of that's a good example
4176000	4180000	It's not totally unheard of that other companies might get to do Nintendo stuff in the arcade
4180000	4185000	One of my favorite and most underrated arcade machines ever F-Zero
4185000	4188000	Which is a fucking amazing game
4188000	4193000	Actually the arcade machine's biggest problem was it only had six freaking tracks in it
4193000	4195000	And you could unlock them all at home
4195000	4199000	There's one of the guys that's in the Playstation hacking scene or whatever
4199000	4202000	He's kind of gotten out of it now but know what his thing is now
4202000	4205000	He's dumping the stuff for the Triforce system
4205000	4206000	Nice
4206000	4209000	Yeah of course the Triforce system was the F-Zero game
4209000	4211000	Because that was Nintendo, Sega, and Namco
4211000	4212000	This looks really fun
4212000	4213000	All on one
4213000	4218000	It's like you take a different corner and everyone's got different minigames
4218000	4220000	But it looks really cool
4220000	4223000	I'll link the website to everyone in the chatroom
4223000	4226000	You know how that would make millions here in the US
4226000	4227000	Tickets
4227000	4228000	Is have it spit tickets
4228000	4229000	Yeah
4229000	4235000	Gee I wonder if this will be part of New Super Mario Brothers Wii Dose
4235000	4236000	Maybe
4236000	4238000	You never know
4238000	4245000	Alright let's move on, travel the world, look at some release dates of actual stuff coming to a store near you
4245000	4251000	We're in April now so now that we've passed the fiscal end of years for a lot of companies
4251000	4254000	There's not a lot of companies putting out stuff
4254000	4255000	So here's what we've got
4255000	4259000	Carnival Games, Monkey See Monkey Do for the Xbox 360 and Kinect
4259000	4261000	That's coming out this week
4261000	4265000	Karaoke Revolution Glee volume 2
4265000	4268000	Coming out game only and with a mic
4268000	4270000	Sorry I just burped
4270000	4272000	Sorry
4272000	4276000	Remington Super Slam Hunting Alaska on the Wii
4276000	4278000	Starring Sarah Palin
4278000	4280000	Except not really
4280000	4284000	And then on the 3DS a week from today
4284000	4288000	Tom Clancy Splinter Cell 3D
4288000	4294000	And I believe Raven Grab is travel through time 3D is also coming out at the same time
4294000	4296000	That's it
4296000	4297000	Wow
4297000	4298000	Yeah
4298000	4300000	Short week
4300000	4301000	Alright
4301000	4303000	As will be much of April
4303000	4304000	Well
4304000	4306000	SSJ100 Matt says needs more bacon
4306000	4309000	Let's go to Japan real quick and look at the games coming out there
4309000	4315000	We have Bullet Soul comes out in Japan this week on the Xbox 360 and Dragon Age Origins Awakening
4315000	4318000	I imagine it seems like they're behind a little bit
4318000	4322000	Keep in mind they've got to translate that stuff into Japanese so it is a little bit behind
4322000	4324000	On the Playstation 3 this week
4324000	4325000	Nada
4325000	4327000	Going over to some other systems then
4327000	4329000	Taking a look at the Wii
4329000	4331000	Nothing there either
4331000	4333000	In fact not a lot on the horizon for the Wii
4333000	4335000	How about the 3DS in Japan?
4335000	4338000	Well you got a game called Cubic Ninja comes out this week in Japan
4338000	4343000	It looks like you move little boxes that have ninja looking graphics on them
4343000	4347000	And you, I don't know, move them around these stages and make them fall down holes
4347000	4349000	It looks like a puzzle game
4349000	4355000	Let's say it's a puzzle game, it uses the tilt controls on the 3DS and it is a 3DS game without 3D
4355000	4357000	Is that coming, oh really
4357000	4359000	It's coming out over here in June
4359000	4361000	Just the screenshots that I just so briefly saw
4361000	4366000	It kind of looked like the yellow blob on the PSP port of the Loco
4366000	4367000	Loco Loco?
4367000	4369000	Loco Loco, yeah, looked like that
4369000	4372000	On the PSP this week, Earth Defense Force 2 portable
4372000	4374000	That might be an interesting lookie
4374000	4375000	Awesome
4375000	4377000	Princess Frontier portable, awesome
4377000	4381000	And then a game called Are You Alice? comes out this week on the PSP
4381000	4387000	Hello, are you Alice? No, okay, are you Alice? No, are you Alice?
4387000	4389000	Regular and limited edition
4389000	4391000	This looks to be, it's kind of like based off an anime it looks like
4391000	4397000	Kind of like these chapters, looks like kind of like one of those interactive novel type things
4397000	4399000	Because there's regular and limited edition
4399000	4400000	It's a dating sim
4400000	4401000	Is it really?
4401000	4402000	I think it is
4402000	4404000	No, this looks too like
4404000	4409000	If this is a dating sim, no, the woman would not have a sword in a dating sim
4409000	4413000	Look at it, it's got all that text
4413000	4414000	Oh boy, alright
4414000	4420000	And there's some pretty fun, funny hentai ones out there that involve swords and dragons and tentacles
4420000	4423000	Coming next year from Quadratic Dream
4423000	4424000	Are you Jason?
4424000	4426000	The side story for Heavy Rain
4426000	4429000	Are you Jason? No, okay
4429000	4432000	Are you Jason? Have you seen Jason? Do you know Jason?
4432000	4435000	That's it for Japanese release dates
4435000	4439000	Well in the UK, Jack and Squat really
4439000	4443000	On the 5th is Red Faction Battlegrounds for Xbox 360
4443000	4447000	And the same thing a day later on the 6th for Playstation 3
4447000	4452000	And also the Dishwasher Vampire Smile on Xbox 360
4452000	4454000	What the crap is that?
4454000	4460000	Sounds like the sequel to the Dishwasher, the indie game that ended up being a real arcade release
4460000	4461000	Oh yeah
4461000	4463000	Sounds like a sequel
4463000	4468000	There's people in cages and a dude with a big sword
4468000	4470000	That is a sequel to the game
4470000	4471000	I would play that
4471000	4474000	Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys
4474000	4476000	And then the classic game of the week
4476000	4479000	And we have a pretty big one this week
4479000	4481000	So we'll get to that in just a moment, but first, Loki
4481000	4485000	I don't know if I can report this story without fear of being sued by Namco
4485000	4486000	But I'm gonna do it anyways
4486000	4491000	Namco Bandai has filed for a couple trademarks in the Katamari franchise
4491000	4499000	Katamari Amore, which is filed under Katamari Amore and Katamari Amore Rolling Whopper
4499000	4503000	Hopefully nothing to do with Burger King
4503000	4508000	And I guess hints obviously that they're gonna put out another game in that series
4508000	4513000	And then of course there's two additional trademark applications for Time Trip and Have a Nice Trip
4513000	4518000	Not necessarily in the Katamari series, perhaps
4518000	4523000	But I guess Trip was one of the characters in Enslaved
4523000	4525000	So maybe it's something to do better
4525000	4528000	Or maybe, heaven forbid, a new IP altogether
4528000	4529000	I don't know
4529000	4532000	Maybe, or it's another Katamari game, who knows
4532000	4535000	Didn't the guy from Namco or whatever
4535000	4536000	Yeah, he left to make
4536000	4538000	Yeah, he made a pretty
4538000	4541000	The subtext was pretty clear that he was sick of the franchise after the second one
4541000	4542000	And he just didn't care anymore
4542000	4545000	They kept making them anyways, or I should say they kept rehashing them
4545000	4548000	Oh, I'm still playing Noby Noby Boy
4548000	4550000	Yeah, because that's what he did after Katamari
4550000	4553000	It's actually fun, people are still doing stuff on Noby Noby Boy
4553000	4557000	On the phone, and uploading everything to Facebook so that girl will grow
4557000	4568000	I hope if it's a new Katamari game it is not part of this whole jump the shark that's kind of dominated this last generation of the games
4568000	4573000	I'm sure we'll have a Katamari game that'll be in 3D that'll be basically the rehash levels again
4573000	4575000	And it's going to be on the 3DS
4575000	4577000	I'm sure that's going to happen eventually because
4577000	4578000	If it's in 3D I'll throw up
4578000	4582000	Because that's what they do, and whatever
4582000	4585000	I don't know, I can't really get excited about this stuff because
4585000	4588000	Even I bought the last Katamari game that was on 360
4588000	4589000	It was just kind of, eh
4589000	4590000	The 360 one was bad
4590000	4592000	The PS3 one's alright
4592000	4597000	The PS3 one's okay, but the problem with the PS3 one is that it's basically the same stuff from the first two games
4597000	4598000	Mixed together
4598000	4599000	It's kind of like
4599000	4603000	The Katamari game on the PS3 is like the Wilson Phillips greatest hits album
4603000	4606000	They only fucking had two CDs, right?
4606000	4610000	So there's not a lot to compile a greatest hits album from
4610000	4614000	Daft Punk has the greatest hits and I think they only had what, three albums?
4614000	4615000	Yeah
4615000	4619000	I guess it's kind of like that then, I don't know
4619000	4624000	You know, surely you've seen those one hit wonders that have these greatest hits CDs
4624000	4628000	When I'm discovered and released an album, I'm just gonna call it Greatest Hits
4628000	4630000	Like your first album will just be called Greatest Hits?
4630000	4631000	My first album will be Greatest Hits
4631000	4634000	My second one will be, well these are better than the last ones
4634000	4638000	You know the DDR band Erotic, which of course
4638000	4639000	Greatest Tits
4639000	4641000	Yeah, they had an album called Greatest Tits
4641000	4643000	I like that name
4643000	4647000	Moving on, one more story for me for this part of the show
4647000	4649000	PlayStation Rewards
4649000	4650000	Remember this?
4650000	4653000	It was a beta program that happened last year
4653000	4655000	And the beta is now ending
4655000	4661000	And this PlayStation Rewards program was supposed to be launching for all the PlayStation folks in the next month
4661000	4665000	But I guess Sony has decided based on what they've learned throughout the beta test
4665000	4668000	They do not want to roll this program out to the public yet
4668000	4673000	So yeah, they're gonna say, well we thank loyal and devoted customers with innovative offerings
4673000	4675000	But yeah, it's not happening right now
4675000	4680000	In fact, they're thinking it's been delayed indefinitely
4680000	4684000	Now the PlayStation Rewards program was supposed to have these quests
4684000	4687000	And other things that go with it
4687000	4688000	It was supposed to be quests
4688000	4690000	Did you get real tangible stuff from this I think?
4690000	4694000	You could get pro or legendary status from this
4694000	4697000	And I think you got free PlayStation Pulse
4697000	4699000	Or move things, I don't know
4699000	4701000	You get little trinkets from it
4701000	4704000	Yeah, they've decided to delay this indefinitely so far
4704000	4708000	So I don't know, maybe they'll come out and say they changed their mind at E3
4708000	4712000	But a quote from a PlayStation representative
4712000	4716000	After careful consideration and evaluation following the PlayStation Rewards beta
4716000	4719000	We have decided not to roll out the program to the public at this time
4719000	4723000	We remain committed to providing the best overall consumer experience for our users
4723000	4727000	And we will be refocusing our efforts in the near future to further developing PlayStation Plus
4727000	4729000	And our other network services
4729000	4734000	So maybe becoming a PlayStation Plus member is all the reward they want to give you
4734000	4736000	That's what it sounds like anyway
4736000	4739000	So if you want rewards, you gotta pay for them
4739000	4743000	They're like, wait, we can charge people for these rewards
4743000	4744000	Awesome
4744000	4747000	Yeah, that's not a reward really, that's a sale
4747000	4749000	That's buying something
4749000	4750000	Yeah
4750000	4752000	Alright, well let's get to the part of the show
4752000	4756000	And you shouldn't really have to bribe somebody to use the different services on there
4756000	4758000	That's what I'm saying
4758000	4763000	Okay, now let's get to the part of the show where we take a stroll down memory lane
4763000	4768000	And revisit a classic video game from the archives in Dark Sakura
4768000	4770000	This one's really classic, it's kinda moldy
4770000	4773000	Yeah, in her quest to find the classic game of the week
4773000	4777000	That she thinks, hey you ungrateful bastard kids, you need to play this game right away
4777000	4778000	And get off my lawn
4778000	4781000	Alright, or mow my lawn if you're gonna stand on it
4781000	4783000	Yeah, mow my lawn, seriously, it frickin' needs it
4783000	4785000	Then get off it
4785000	4787000	Alright, Dark Sakura, what is the classic game of the week?
4787000	4791000	I think there's only one way to introduce that, and that's to play some of the dialogue off
4791000	4793000	Alright, let's see what I can do here
4793000	4796000	I think I have to fast forward a wee bit in this video to get to the dialogue
4796000	4797000	Here you go
4806000	4808000	Wow, what a mansion
4811000	4814000	I hope this is not Chris's blood
4817000	4818000	Okay, this is Resident Evil
4818000	4823000	And I actually did put up a sample of the redone dialogue in the GameCube version
4823000	4826000	That's so much better, so much better
4827000	4829000	I can probably get to a little bit of that here, let's see
4829000	4831000	What is this place?
4833000	4836000	Not quite your ordinary house, that's for sure
4837000	4839000	Hey, Wesker, where's Chris?
4840000	4841000	I bought the GameCube for that
4841000	4842000	Jill, no
4842000	4844000	You don't wanna go back out there
4845000	4847000	But we've got to be saying the same stuff
4847000	4848000	What was that?
4849000	4850000	Chris?
4850000	4851000	Anyway
4851000	4852000	No
4852000	4854000	I hope this is not Chris's blood
4854000	4856000	Master of Unlocking
4856000	4859000	Maybe you, the Master of Unlocking, can use this
4859000	4860000	Yeah
4860000	4863000	Let's see, so it was known as Biohazard in Japan
4863000	4868000	Which actually, I've got a PlayStation version of Biohazard and I have it on Saturn
4868000	4871000	But this one is put out by Capcom
4871000	4876000	And it spawned a legacy still going on today
4876000	4879000	It was developed by Shinji Mikami
4879000	4884000	And as of May 2009, it sold 40 million copies
4884000	4889000	So this was one of the early ones into the survival horror series
4889000	4895000	And you, it had a full motion intro
4895000	4899000	But they cut part of the intro for the American one
4899000	4902000	Because there is a scene where Chris pulls out his Zippo
4902000	4905000	Lights a cigarette and takes a drag
4905000	4909000	And then there's another scene where this zombie's head falls off and it looks like Michael Jordan
4909000	4911000	They cut that too
4911000	4913000	Honestly, it didn't look like Michael Jordan, guys
4913000	4915000	It didn't, it was stupid
4915000	4916000	But yeah
4916000	4920000	So with this one, basically you are S.T.A.R.S. member
4920000	4924000	Jill Valentine or Chris Redfield
4924000	4928000	And you are exploring this mansion and unlocking its secrets
4928000	4930000	And Chris is helped by Claire
4930000	4932000	Was it Claire? Yeah, it was Claire
4932000	4934000	And she was young and perky and a medic
4934000	4937000	Rebecca, that was it, Claire was his sister
4937000	4939000	It was Rebecca
4939000	4943000	And Barry helps Jill
4943000	4946000	He also has the best line in the game
4946000	4948000	You are almost a Jill sandwich
4948000	4952000	And I hope this is not Chris's blood
4952000	4953000	So yeah
4953000	4958000	It was really, really ahead of its time when it came out
4958000	4963000	And there's actually other versions out
4963000	4967000	They did the, I think it was called
4967000	4971000	I'm trying to find the name of it
4971000	4975000	They did a redone version of it that was
4975000	4979000	Like a remix
4979000	4981000	I believe it was like a remix version
4981000	4984000	And they had different outfits and the items in the house were in different places
4984000	4986000	And the graphics were touched up a little bit
4986000	4989000	And then there was the GameCube version
4989000	4991000	Which we just heard a little bit of
4991000	4994000	That was completely redone, better dialogue
4994000	4997000	I think it still had the same voice cast though
4997000	5001000	But it's pretty much the original game
5001000	5004000	Just really, really cleaned up
5004000	5006000	Some of the story elements
5006000	5009000	They added a little bit more references to the sequel
5009000	5012000	And Code of Veronica, I think they fixed some of the continuity issues
5012000	5015000	But otherwise it was the same game
5015000	5019000	But even in the very first one they had a reference to Ada
5019000	5022000	Who was in Resident Evil 2
5022000	5024000	And she was really cool
5024000	5027000	And it also has my favorite thing in here
5027000	5029000	Is the diary
5029000	5031000	Ugly face so ate him
5031000	5034000	Itchy, tasty
5034000	5037000	Yeah, so that's where itchy tasty comes from
5037000	5041000	So this one, I mean it spawned all kinds of sequels
5041000	5043000	You know, we had Code Veronica
5043000	5046000	We had Resident Evil 2 and 3, 4 and 5
5046000	5050000	Who remembers Dino Crisis?
5050000	5053000	Dino Crisis is actually pretty neat
5053000	5060000	It actually just announced Resident Evil Revelations for the 3DS
5060000	5065000	And that they had Resident Evil Portable
5065000	5067000	There's all kinds of versions out there
5067000	5068000	There's mobile games
5068000	5070000	I even had this on the game.com
5070000	5074000	I'm reminded of a
5074000	5077000	I'm not sure if it was the advance
5077000	5081000	But there was a Resident Evil novel guidance side story
5081000	5084000	Where it's Leon and Barry on a cruise ship, I think
5084000	5085000	I think you were right
5085000	5087000	I don't think it's canon
5087000	5090000	Because that's some obscure stuff
5090000	5093000	There were the Umbrella Chronicles, the Dark Side Chronicles
5093000	5095000	Resident Evil Outbreak
5095000	5098000	It was a mobile one, you said?
5098000	5099000	Or handheld?
5099000	5100000	Handheld
5100000	5105000	There was Biohazard Eye Survivor
5105000	5108000	And Resident Evil Assault the Nightmare
5108000	5112000	You know, actually one of my favorites in the series was Gun Survivor
5112000	5114000	Which I got to play in the arcade
5114000	5116000	No, Gun Con was Namco
5116000	5118000	The accessory
5118000	5121000	Well, in Japan you could play it with the gun
5121000	5123000	But in the US it
5123000	5125000	Oh yeah, because you can't use those here
5125000	5126000	They're taboo
5126000	5129000	Which I always thought it would have been perfect to do it on the Dreamcast
5129000	5131000	Maybe Gun Con in the US
5131000	5134000	But you couldn't play Gun Survivor, you just navigated through
5134000	5138000	But I thought that with the D-pad that was on the gun
5138000	5140000	You should have been able to control with that
5140000	5143000	Although the arcade version was really cool because you
5143000	5145000	Walked by pressing forward with the gun
5145000	5148000	And you could back up with the gun, it was really fun
5148000	5152000	But the first Gun Survivor one I think was Code Veronica
5152000	5154000	Or was it the second one?
5154000	5156000	I think that was the second one
5156000	5158000	But that's the one I played
5158000	5162000	And there was also Resident Evil Operation Raccoon City
5162000	5164000	That was another one
5164000	5170000	It's supposed to be coming out on Playstation 3, Xbox 360, and on Windows
5170000	5173000	And Resident Evil 6 is also coming out
5173000	5176000	So yeah, all kinds of stuff going on
5176000	5180000	And then there's movies, which the movies don't really have a lot to do with the game
5180000	5182000	Not anymore really
5182000	5185000	Just a few things that are in common
5185000	5188000	And there were all kinds of comics that went out
5188000	5192000	They did a manhua, which the Code Veronica one was actually really good
5192000	5193000	I liked it
5193000	5195000	All kinds of cool stuff
5195000	5197000	So yeah, Resident Evil
5197000	5199000	Worst voice acting ever in the first one
5199000	5201000	But it's laughable, it's fantastic
5201000	5205000	And I think Resident Evil of the 3D generation of consoles
5205000	5207000	The Playstation 1 was the first game
5207000	5211000	That really spawned an entirely new genre
5211000	5213000	Which was survival horror
5213000	5215000	And we have Resident Evil to thank for Silent Hill
5215000	5217000	And that whole franchise
5217000	5221000	I think Silent Hill took a different turn in survival horror
5221000	5223000	Well yeah, but just the whole dark
5223000	5225000	You against monsters
5225000	5227000	The whole scary thing
5227000	5229000	I think Resident Evil sort of laid down the foundation
5229000	5231000	I don't know, I always thought Friday the 13th
5231000	5233000	On the Nintendo spawn
5233000	5235000	No way, no way
5235000	5237000	It was Nightmare on Elm Street
5237000	5241000	Or maybe it was the Metal Gear
5241000	5243000	Which I think was always kind of
5243000	5245000	I don't know, it's not necessarily survival horror
5245000	5247000	It's survival tactics
5247000	5249000	Survival, tactical, dodging
5249000	5251000	Well that's always stealth
5251000	5253000	Yeah, that'd be stealth action
5253000	5255000	Whatever, shut up
5255000	5257000	But did any of those games have zombie dogs?
5257000	5259000	They did not
5259000	5261000	Okay then, zombie dogs
5261000	5263000	So is that it? That's it
5263000	5265000	Classic game of the week, Resident Evil
5265000	5267000	Oh, there's actually one more thing
5267000	5269000	Make it quick
5269000	5271000	That was a beta
5271000	5273000	Of Resident Evil 2
5273000	5275000	That had a different character named
5275000	5277000	Elza Walker and Leon
5277000	5279000	And she was like a motorcycle chick
5279000	5281000	Wearing the red and white leathers
5281000	5285000	And they actually ended up scrapping it
5285000	5287000	When it was about 60% done
5287000	5289000	I'm trying to get my hands on one of those
5289000	5293000	I think my N64 box, the console system
5293000	5295000	When the N64 first came out
5295000	5297000	You know how they have
5297000	5299000	On the side of the box
5299000	5301000	The game, like if you buy this console
5301000	5303000	Here are the games that are coming out
5303000	5305000	I have one that has a Resident Evil 1.5
5305000	5307000	Or 2, because it was supposed to be an N64 game
5307000	5309000	It was supposed to be Resident Evil 2
5309000	5311000	Yeah, that's on that and it never came out
5311000	5313000	I guess for that system
5313000	5315000	Because I said the backgrounds weren't interesting enough
5315000	5317000	But it had a lot of the same mechanics
5317000	5319000	From the first one
5319000	5321000	But they saved a few things to what eventually became the second one
5321000	5323000	And lost a kind of cool looking character
5323000	5325000	Sad face
5325000	5327000	That's it
5327000	5329000	Well that's it for your classic game of the week
5329000	5331000	We'll see what she picks next week

5351000	5353000	Because there's some really interesting news
5353000	5355000	So that could be very interesting

5411000	5413000	The best little Hoard House in Azeroth
5413000	5415000	It's a little side project
5415000	5417000	Xtfer and I have all about the world

5423000	5425000	Up to 20 episodes this week
5425000	5427000	We hit 30
5427000	5429000	Nice you're old
5429000	5431000	Oh wait we're on 408 of this show
5431000	5433000	I know right
5433000	5435000	Quickly going to go to
5435000	5437000	The rapid fire news
5437000	5439000	And the tweets and all that stuff
5439000	5441000	I wanted to ask you
5441000	5443000	Speaking of Twitter and all that
5443000	5445000	Some folks saw that you were doing a little bit of fundraising this week
5445000	5447000	By selling off some of your
5447000	5449000	Video game collection
5449000	5451000	Which I know is probably not an easy thing to do
5451000	5453000	But what was some of the stuff you sold this week
5453000	5455000	And how did it do?
5455000	5457000	My most coveted title
5457000	5459000	That I got rid of was
5459000	5461000	Magic Knight Rayearth
5461000	5463000	By Working Designs for the Sega Saturn
5463000	5465000	It was the last game put out in the US
5465000	5467000	Months after the Saturn was already
5467000	5469000	Dead and buried
5469000	5471000	They put this out
5471000	5473000	Even more rare I think than Panzer Dragoon Saga
5473000	5475000	I want to say
5475000	5477000	It's up there
5477000	5479000	Panzer Dragoon RPG
5479000	5481000	I don't know
5481000	5483000	The two of them are pretty much rivals
5483000	5485000	For hardest to find
5485000	5487000	So Rayearth was a top down
5487000	5489000	Basically it was a Legend of Zelda
5489000	5491000	A Link to the Past clone
5491000	5493000	As far as visually how it looked
5493000	5495000	The RPG
5495000	5497000	Anime cutscenes
5497000	5499000	The clamp anime
5499000	5501000	Beautiful show
5501000	5503000	They did such a good job with translating it
5503000	5505000	Especially since they don't talk every time you touch something
5505000	5507000	Like in a Japanese one
5507000	5509000	It saved so much memory
5509000	5511000	It was so much better
5511000	5513000	So that went for
5513000	5515000	I've seen it go for over $100
5515000	5517000	But I got about $80 for it
5517000	5519000	That's not too bad
5519000	5521000	I never played it
5521000	5523000	Never touched it
5523000	5525000	We've beaten it
5525000	5527000	Bust a Move
5527000	5529000	Not the puzzle bobble thing
5529000	5531000	But it was released in the US as Bust a Groove
5531000	5533000	The soundtrack
5533000	5535000	I think in the JP
5535000	5537000	Edition was a lot better
5537000	5539000	Paper Mario 64
5539000	5541000	Ogre Battle 64
5541000	5543000	And a bunch of Saturn import stuff
5543000	5545000	Darkstalkers
5545000	5547000	X-Men vs Street Fighter
5547000	5549000	I'm going to have a round 2 of stuff
5549000	5551000	Going up next week
5551000	5553000	One of which will include
5553000	5555000	The PS2 edition of Rez
5555000	5557000	I'm getting rid of that
5557000	5559000	Because I have it at Rez HD on Xbox 360
5559000	5561000	And I think some DDR games
5561000	5563000	You're going to get rid of too right?
5563000	5565000	Yeah I'm selling my PS1
5565000	5567000	3rd Mix and Best Hits
5567000	5569000	Which I think came out after
5569000	5571000	4th and before 5th
5571000	5573000	Let me talk to you about Rez
5573000	5575000	Ok
5575000	5577000	So check that out, that'll be up soon
5577000	5579000	The reason I'm getting rid of these
5579000	5581000	Is because they're in great shape
5581000	5583000	I know I'm never going to play them again
5583000	5585000	But actually having them in my hand
5585000	5587000	I wanted to hook my Saturn up
5587000	5589000	To play some Vampire Savior
5589000	5591000	Even though if it wasn't for me selling them
5591000	5593000	I never would have had the Inkling
5593000	5595000	To ever touch the game again
5595000	5597000	Even though it's a great game
5597000	5599000	So it's just weird how you're attached to something
5599000	5601000	But you know you'd never play it
5601000	5603000	Unless you're confronted with getting rid of it
5603000	5605000	It's just weird how nostalgia works
5605000	5607000	That's kind of how our vault is
5607000	5609000	Except we sometimes do get the wild hair
5609000	5611000	To break out one of the systems and play it
5611000	5613000	I mean the whole reason we have
5613000	5615000	So many systems is because nothing quite
5615000	5617000	Mimics having the controller
5617000	5619000	In your hand
5619000	5621000	You can play Vampire Savior with us
5621000	5623000	I'll hook up the Saturn
5623000	5625000	Alright, well let's get to some rapid
5625000	5627000	Fire news before we get into
5627000	5629000	Doing the tweets tonight
5629000	5631000	Last call for tweets at twitter.com slash o-l-r
5631000	5633000	Meanwhile Loki hates to tear you
5633000	5635000	Away from whatever it is you're doing over there
5635000	5637000	That involves a lot of numbers
5637000	5639000	I don't think that's porn
5639000	5641000	But yeah we gotta do some rapid news
5641000	5643000	I'm crunching in numbers
5643000	5645000	Yeah there's some cool announcements
5645000	5647000	Chopped Lifter HD
5647000	5649000	It's a remake of the classic game
5649000	5651000	Supposed to be coming out on the Playstation
5651000	5653000	Network and PC this fall
5653000	5655000	And based on some of the screenshots
5655000	5657000	Here
5657000	5659000	Looks
5659000	5661000	A little
5661000	5663000	Much like the classic game just you know
5663000	5665000	With the 3D HD visuals
5667000	5669000	Kinda cool looking
5669000	5671000	I don't know, hopefully it turns out well
5671000	5673000	And then
5673000	5675000	Another remake also in the works
5675000	5677000	Warlords
5677000	5679000	The old Atari game is being remade
5679000	5681000	That one's coming to Xbox Live Arcade
5681000	5683000	And Playstation Network this summer
5683000	5685000	You probably can expect that as part of the
5685000	5687000	Summer of gaming or whatever the hell they call it
5687000	5689000	On the Xbox Live
5689000	5691000	They're saying that it's gonna also
5691000	5693000	I guess have the classic version
5693000	5695000	As well as an
5695000	5697000	Evolved version
5697000	5699000	I guess which was found
5699000	5701000	Or they had the evolved version
5701000	5703000	Which was in a previous Xbox Live Arcade release
5703000	5705000	But this
5705000	5707000	I guess is gonna be
5707000	5709000	Something different
5709000	5711000	Never really played
5711000	5713000	The original Warlords game so
5713000	5715000	I don't know, looks neat
5715000	5717000	And then finally
5717000	5719000	Minecraft
5719000	5721000	Goes into beta 1.4
5721000	5723000	And they added
5723000	5725000	The wolves, cookies
5725000	5727000	And some other stuff
5727000	5729000	Yeah tameable wolves
5729000	5731000	Cookies, sleeping in a bed
5731000	5733000	Resets your spawn position
5733000	5735000	A new logo holding shift while
5735000	5737000	Climbing will hang onto the ladder
5737000	5739000	Spiders no longer
5739000	5741000	Trample crops and
5741000	5743000	Lots and lots of infrastructure
5743000	5745000	And statistical
5745000	5747000	achievements
5747000	5749000	Alright
5749000	5751000	Neat, let's
5751000	5753000	Have you played Minecraft yet?
5753000	5755000	No I have not either
5755000	5757000	I watched a funny video today though
5757000	5759000	Of some girl's Minecraft house
5759000	5761000	And she was just really funny
5761000	5763000	Oh my god there's like 400 pounds of bacon right here
5763000	5765000	And there were like pigs everywhere in front of her house
5765000	5767000	It was really funny
5767000	5769000	I haven't played Minecraft
5769000	5771000	But yet I've played SingStar
5771000	5773000	And SingStar is adding 40 new songs to the store
5773000	5775000	This week
5775000	5777000	Now you can sing along with such karaoke classics
5777000	5779000	As Cryin' by Aerosmith
5779000	5781000	Who Let the Dogs Out by The Baja Men
5781000	5783000	Crocodile Rock by Elton John
5783000	5785000	Let's see
5785000	5787000	I'm Good I'm Gone by Leaky Lee
5787000	5789000	Likey Lee?
5789000	5791000	I don't even know how to say her name
5791000	5793000	She's crazier than Bjork
5793000	5795000	I don't know how you would sing along to that
5795000	5797000	But you can now
5797000	5799000	Grace Kelly by Mika
5799000	5801000	A bunch of songs by the band Razorlight
5801000	5803000	Oh, Just for Salacious Pop
5803000	5805000	I know you love the Pussycat Dolls
5805000	5807000	So you can do Hush Hush now
5807000	5809000	On SingStar
5809000	5811000	Also some dance add-ons have been sold as well
5811000	5813000	And then most interesting in a way
5813000	5815000	Classical song packs
5815000	5817000	I'm not sure how exactly you sing
5817000	5819000	I guess maybe it's old opera style
5819000	5821000	I don't know but you can do
5821000	5823000	O Sole Mio by Di Capua
5823000	5825000	Mozart with Queen of the Night Aria
5825000	5827000	La Donna y Mobile
5827000	5829000	by Verdi
5829000	5831000	I don't know why but yeah
5831000	5833000	now classic songs are available
5833000	5835000	I know classical singers
5835000	5837000	That's a series that's like Boohoo Crazy in Europe
5837000	5839000	Yeah, it's pretty big over there
5839000	5841000	There are okay games here
5841000	5843000	They had the SingStar Queen
5843000	5845000	and the SingStar Abba
5845000	5847000	Probably the biggest thing about this is that
5847000	5849000	the actual music videos, if available, play
5849000	5851000	behind the song when you're singing it
5851000	5853000	So that's pretty cool
5853000	5855000	Can't wait to see the music video for the Mozart stuff
5855000	5857000	I know, I'm kind of wondering how that's gonna work
5857000	5859000	I have some generic video in the background there
5859000	5861000	I don't know
5861000	5863000	Well, some more information following unfortunately
5863000	5865000	the tragedy in Japan
5865000	5867000	It has some folks asking a little bit forward
5867000	5869000	What's gonna happen to Tokyo Game Show 2011?
5869000	5871000	Well, now there's no plans to
5871000	5873000	cancel the Tokyo Game Show just yet
5873000	5875000	But they are saying it could happen in a reduced state
5875000	5877000	This was in an interview
5877000	5879000	that the Tokyo Game Show officials did with Kotaku
5879000	5881000	They didn't say anything yet
5881000	5883000	But they did say
5883000	5885000	Depending on the situation from here on out
5885000	5887000	It's possible that the show
5887000	5889000	is reduced
5889000	5891000	The show is scheduled to take place in September
5891000	5893000	I'm sure it'll still be a
5893000	5895000	pretty big thing and they haven't said
5895000	5897000	it's closed off to the public or any of that yet
5897000	5899000	But they are treading a little bit
5899000	5901000	carefully with a lot of uncertainty
5901000	5903000	still happening in the world
5903000	5905000	after the really unfortunate
5905000	5907000	earthquake and subsequent
5907000	5909000	tsunami and subsequent issues with the reactor
5909000	5911000	and all that stuff
5911000	5913000	Hopefully they're able to get all that sorted out
5913000	5915000	in the 2021 show in September
5915000	5917000	Speaking of the tragedy in Japan
5917000	5919000	A real favorite here of
5919000	5921000	Orange Lounge Radio is spearing up a new
5921000	5923000	effort to raise money
5923000	5925000	Akira Yamaoka, who of course was
5925000	5927000	one of the minds behind Silent Hill
5927000	5929000	and so forth, he is doing a benefit
5929000	5931000	album for tsunami survivors
5931000	5933000	It's called Play for Japan
5933000	5935000	Kind of a play on words of the
5935000	5937000	Pray for Japan Twitter hashtag that was going on at the time
5937000	5939000	It's gonna be a benefit album
5939000	5941000	and it's gonna have some of these
5941000	5943000	participants will be involved
5943000	5945000	Akira Yamaoka, Nobuo Uematsu
5945000	5947000	who did of course Final Fantasy and a lot of those
5947000	5949000	Yasunori Mitsuda, Chrono Trigger
5949000	5951000	hello, need I say more
5951000	5953000	Bear McCreery, if you don't recognize that
5953000	5955000	Battlestar Galactica
5955000	5957000	and which, god that had a great
5957000	5959000	soundtrack that show
5959000	5961000	and Woody Jackson who did Red Dead Redemption
5961000	5963000	so some western influence
5963000	5965000	as well as from Japan
5965000	5967000	so that's pretty awesome
5967000	5969000	Akira Yamaoka also posted a letter at
5969000	5971000	playforjapan.org
5971000	5973000	available in several languages
5973000	5975000	so that's pretty cool, it's supposed to come out in May 2011
5975000	5977000	on iTunes
5977000	5979000	so you don't even have to leave the house to do your
5979000	5981000	little bit to help support
5981000	5983000	the Japanese relief, I think that's a great idea
5983000	5985000	Alright, let's move on
5985000	5987000	Dr. Sakura
5987000	5989000	Well, we have some
5989000	5991000	Street Fighter news actually coming out of
5991000	5993000	the UK
5993000	5995000	there was
5995000	5997000	registered for the BBFC
5997000	5999000	Super Street Fighter 4 Arcade Edition
5999000	6001000	to be coming out in June
6001000	6003000	that's the British Board of Film Classification
6003000	6005000	which also is in charge of
6005000	6007000	video games for some reason
6007000	6009000	why can't they do that here?
6009000	6011000	anyway
6011000	6013000	Capcom hasn't
6013000	6015000	necessarily confirmed
6015000	6017000	but they're putting out that there's
6017000	6019000	that it could be
6019000	6021000	download content
6021000	6023000	or you can buy an expansion, they're still
6023000	6025000	speculating
6025000	6027000	also in other news
6027000	6029000	Music Unlimited, the platform is coming
6029000	6031000	to PSP, NGP
6031000	6033000	and Xperia Play
6033000	6035000	this was actually stated
6035000	6037000	by the CEO of Sony Network
6037000	6039000	Entertainment, Sean Layden
6039000	6041000	saying that it's going to be coming
6041000	6043000	to the PSP in a matter of weeks
6043000	6045000	so that will be later on this year
6045000	6047000	and
6047000	6049000	this is
6049000	6051000	as far as I can tell
6051000	6053000	I think this is a music sharing
6053000	6055000	program
6055000	6057000	from what it looks like
6057000	6059000	but like a legal way of doing it
6059000	6061000	instead of like you know
6061000	6063000	LimeWire or whatever the kids use these days
6063000	6065000	BitTorrent I guess
6065000	6067000	and then in Rock Band 3
6067000	6069000	news we have Joy Division download content
6069000	6071000	which I like Joy Division
6071000	6073000	but not just them, we have Grand Funk Railroad
6073000	6075000	the Locomotion and we're an American band
6075000	6077000	and J Gal's band Freeze Frame
6077000	6079000	and Joy Division Love Will Tear Us Apart
6079000	6081000	That's it
6081000	6083000	Alright, let's go to the Twitter
6083000	6085000	but first I want to read a comment here from our chatroom
6085000	6087000	at chat.orangelandtrady.com
6087000	6089000	Kossin in our chatroom says
6089000	6091000	I do not want the MPAA
6091000	6093000	in charge of video game ratings
6093000	6095000	those guys are idiots
6095000	6097000	yeah actually that's a really good point, those guys are idiots
6097000	6099000	you know the way they rate some of those movies
6099000	6101000	is unbelievable
6101000	6103000	I like the idea of a unified system
6103000	6105000	between movies and
6105000	6107000	video games but don't fucking put the MPAA
6107000	6109000	in charge of that, dismantle the MPAA
6109000	6111000	and put a new board in charge
6111000	6113000	that would be a wonderful idea
6113000	6115000	so a good point from that person in our chatroom
6115000	6117000	Let's go to the Twitter
6117000	6119000	twitter.com
6119000	6121000	slash o-l-r is where you can send us
6121000	6123000	tweets every week
6123000	6125000	we read your tweets here on the show and we'll respond to them
6125000	6127000	Fun ET Man sent us a tweet
6127000	6129000	saying I wonder if you will talk about this
6129000	6131000	and sent us to an article on
6131000	6133000	thelostlevels.org
6133000	6135000	this is a website that likes to kind of find
6135000	6137000	old prototypes and things that have
6137000	6139000	changed in games, they've done some
6139000	6141000	stories on Zelda or whatever
6141000	6143000	well this article happens to be on the game
6143000	6145000	Bio Force Ape
6145000	6147000	and I guess this is a game that was kind of recently
6147000	6149000	finally dumped into a ROM
6149000	6151000	here's the deal, this game never actually
6151000	6153000	came out, it was teased in
6153000	6155000	Nintendo Power in the early 90's
6155000	6157000	it was an NES game and in this game
6157000	6159000	you take control of Bio Force Ape
6159000	6161000	a genetically altered super chimpanzee
6161000	6163000	as he tries to make his way through a high-tech
6163000	6165000	maze to rescue his adopted human family
6165000	6167000	what? yeah right?
6167000	6169000	apparently one of the best parts of the game
6169000	6171000	is when Bio Force Ape takes a wild out of
6171000	6173000	control ride on one of the speeding platforms
6173000	6175000	or coal cars
6175000	6177000	animation is humorous and so on and so on
6177000	6179000	and yeah so I guess there was
6179000	6181000	this whole debacle, somebody had
6181000	6183000	the game, it came out in
6183000	6185000	2005 that the game was out
6185000	6187000	there and that there was photographic evidence
6187000	6189000	taken and I guess
6189000	6191000	you know obviously the thing was
6191000	6193000	it had bugs in it and so forth
6193000	6195000	the guy was urged to
6195000	6197000	sell the prototype but he was
6197000	6199000	really scared about the ROM getting out there
6199000	6201000	more
6201000	6203000	stuff came out including this
6203000	6205000	humorous punching of a slime
6205000	6207000	it's like a monkey made out of
6207000	6209000	butter, what is that? I don't even know what that is
6209000	6211000	but then apparently he smashed the
6211000	6213000	cartridge, he said screw you guys
6213000	6215000	I'm going home and smashed the cartridge
6215000	6217000	well apparently the real deal was finally
6217000	6219000	sold and
6219000	6221000	dumped and there's actually a whole little
6221000	6223000	thing available on YouTube
6223000	6225000	where you can actually kind of see some of this game in progress
6229000	6231000	it's fast moving for an NES game at the
6231000	6233000	time, it looks like it has blast processing
6233000	6235000	it looks like it is made by Sega
6235000	6237000	no it's not Sega, it's close
6237000	6239000	it's uh, SETA
6239000	6241000	SETA made the game
6241000	6243000	it looks like a Ninja Gaiden ROM hack
6243000	6245000	or something, a little bit doesn't it
6245000	6247000	it's very fast moving
6247000	6249000	see there's a little minecart
6249000	6251000	it looks kind of cool
6251000	6253000	go monkey go, go monkey go
6253000	6255000	alright
6255000	6257000	let's see moving on to some more
6257000	6259000	tweets here
6259000	6261000	SSA100Matt sent us a tweet saying
6261000	6263000	our old pal YYR has released
6263000	6265000	a press kit for Snake
6265000	6267000	361, it's the sequel
6267000	6269000	to Snake 360
6269000	6271000	Snake 361 is supposed to be coming out for
6271000	6273000	the holidays this year
6273000	6275000	and let's see what is some new stuff
6275000	6277000	teleporters and traps
6277000	6279000	so now you get teleporters in the game
6279000	6281000	of course Snake 360 had the
6281000	6283000	four player battles, it was very
6283000	6285000	multiplayer, they really should let this
6285000	6287000	they really should just let him put it out on Xbox Live
6287000	6289000	it would be really cool if you could actually play it
6289000	6291000	through the interwebs, but right now
6291000	6293000	it's more of a local multiplayer game
6293000	6295000	and I think he had YouTubes of people playing the game
6295000	6297000	and having fun, battle mode
6297000	6299000	will, I mean those teleporters are going to drive you
6299000	6301000	bonkers in battle mode, so that'll be fun
6301000	6303000	and there's some 1080p screenshots
6303000	6305000	available now and some music
6305000	6307000	is all there, so all the information is
6307000	6309000	available at snake360.com
6309000	6311000	Spazinator
6311000	6313000	tweets us a story, it's a Sony
6313000	6315000	story here, let me see what this is all about
6315000	6317000	I've got to load this, it's not loading
6317000	6319000	God dammit he's trying to rickroll us
6319000	6321000	you little bastard, I cut it off
6321000	6323000	before he could, was that real?
6323000	6325000	yeah it started coming, it said Rick Astley
6325000	6327000	nope, nope, done with that
6327000	6329000	so congratulations Spazinator
6329000	6331000	you have banned yourself from
6331000	6333000	Twitter for one whole month, we will not be reading
6333000	6335000	your tweets for one whole month
6335000	6337000	that's what's going to happen to people that try to
6337000	6339000	rickroll us, you are banned from Twitter for a month
6339000	6341000	congratulations, alright
6341000	6343000	let's move on to Tiger Claw
6343000	6345000	sends us a couple links here, one of them
6345000	6347000	is about Burnout Crash
6349000	6351000	Burnout Crash is coming to the
6351000	6353000	Xbox 360 and the Playstation 3
6353000	6355000	I guess EA hasn't
6355000	6357000	announced a new Burnout game
6357000	6359000	but Australia actually released
6359000	6361000	a classification for
6361000	6363000	Burnout Crash
6363000	6365000	and I guess surfing some LinkedIn profiles
6365000	6367000	has found out that this is happening
6367000	6369000	it's an Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 title
6369000	6371000	no official announcement yet
6371000	6373000	seems logical there would be another Burnout game
6373000	6375000	at some point, hopefully it's a little more like
6375000	6377000	the older games, I know the Burnout Paradise
6377000	6379000	or whatever was really well supported
6379000	6381000	but that franchise
6381000	6383000	still sells really well, right?
6383000	6385000	as far as I know, yeah
6385000	6387000	Paradise was awesome
6387000	6389000	alright, I mean
6389000	6391000	come on, you gotta love, it's like
6391000	6393000	oh, any moment I want to go in the crash mode, ok
6393000	6395000	crash mode, it was awesome
6395000	6397000	alright, and
6397000	6399000	moving on, let's see, Tiger Claw
6399000	6401000	sends us one more link here, I'll read
6401000	6403000	the other one he sent us
6403000	6405000	is coming up later, let's see
6405000	6407000	Americans average 13 minutes
6407000	6409000	playing video games on TV
6409000	6411000	daily
6411000	6413000	only 13 minutes?
6413000	6415000	I think that's the people who play for 4 hours at a time
6415000	6417000	balancing out those that don't play at all
6417000	6419000	I don't know how that works, but yeah
6419000	6421000	adults spend an average of 13 minutes
6421000	6423000	a day using a TV to play video games
6423000	6425000	that's from Nielsen's state of the media
6425000	6427000	US TV trends
6427000	6429000	by ethnicity
6429000	6431000	I guess, because now it breaks it all down
6431000	6433000	by ethnic as well
6433000	6435000	African Americans spend slightly more time
6435000	6437000	playing video games on TV averaging
6437000	6439000	16 minutes a day across the population
6439000	6441000	Hispanics spend an average of 10 minutes a day
6441000	6443000	you know, they're all
6443000	6445000	less than 20 minutes
6445000	6447000	which most people I know that play video games spend
6447000	6449000	hours and hours, so
6449000	6451000	this is just this weird law of averages thing
6451000	6453000	coming into play
6453000	6455000	Nielsen got paid probably millions of dollars to do that study
6455000	6457000	that really didn't tell me anything
6457000	6459000	ironically enough though, you have to admit this is a little bit ironic
6459000	6461000	according to their little graph here
6461000	6463000	the smallest ethnicity
6463000	6465000	or I should say the smallest playtime
6465000	6467000	by any ethnicity, 9 minutes
6467000	6469000	Asians, who knew?
6469000	6471000	there you go
6471000	6473000	because they have
6473000	6475000	the tiger mom
6475000	6477000	I guess, I don't know
6477000	6479000	let's move on
6479000	6481000	something a little less racial please
6481000	6483000	a little less racial?
6483000	6485000	alright, fine
6485000	6487000	so we're gonna talk a little bit about
6487000	6489000	the 3DS, obviously
6489000	6491000	3DS probably did pretty well
6491000	6493000	I'd assume
6493000	6495000	Nintendo's saying it's the best first day
6495000	6497000	handheld sales
6497000	6499000	launch ever
6499000	6501000	so
6501000	6503000	there's no real numbers yet
6503000	6505000	but they're saying they did pretty well
6505000	6507000	and I guess the numbers will be made public on April 14th
6507000	6509000	when the NPD numbers actually
6509000	6511000	come out
6511000	6513000	so it'll be interesting to see how well they did
6513000	6515000	I'm assuming they sold everything
6515000	6517000	or at least pretty close to everything within the last
6517000	6519000	probably week it came out
6519000	6521000	so
6521000	6523000	good for them, I suppose
6523000	6525000	unfortunately though
6525000	6527000	it wasn't without problems
6527000	6529000	there are some issues with the 3DS
6529000	6531000	including some crashes
6531000	6533000	apparently people have been running into
6533000	6535000	some software crashes
6535000	6537000	that require the system
6537000	6539000	to be shut off and then turned back on
6539000	6541000	to get it playing right
6541000	6543000	apparently this was fixed in
6543000	6545000	the latest firmware
6545000	6547000	the one you download to get your little 3D video
6547000	6549000	from OKGO
6549000	6551000	so that's kind of cool
6551000	6553000	at least that's been fixed
6553000	6555000	however something that's not really gonna be able to be fixed
6555000	6557000	some sort of patching system
6557000	6559000	is the fact that the hinges once again
6559000	6561000	are loose or at least some people are
6561000	6563000	reporting loose hinges which require
6563000	6565000	you to actually send your system back in to get it repaired
6565000	6567000	what a slut that 3DS
6567000	6569000	must be, totally loose I heard
6569000	6571000	I haven't had that problem with the loose hinge
6571000	6573000	yet, but I know it was something that
6573000	6575000	plagued a lot of systems before
6575000	6577000	especially on the DS Lite
6577000	6579000	kind of sucks
6579000	6581000	but thankfully
6581000	6583000	not a problem for me
6583000	6585000	well hopefully they'll fix a lot of these
6585000	6587000	hardware problems in the 3DS Lite
6587000	6589000	which will come out next year inevitably
6589000	6591000	or the 3DS XL
6591000	6593000	or the 3DS I
6593000	6595000	or the 3DS bigger peen
6595000	6597000	whatever they're gonna call it that comes out next year
6597000	6599000	yeah, so
6599000	6601000	you can bet on that, and then colors of course
6601000	6603000	there'll be colors
6603000	6605000	alright, moving on
6605000	6607000	lawsuit!
6607000	6609000	somebody is suing EA
6609000	6611000	there might be some weight to this one though
6611000	6613000	if you're in law suits or somebody mad about something a little frivolous
6613000	6615000	this could have some actual weight to it
6615000	6617000	you know the game John Madden
6617000	6619000	Football? Well you ought to because
6619000	6621000	this is the series that became Madden
6621000	6623000	NFL like what, oh
6623000	6625000	7, oh 8, oh 9, 11, 10
6625000	6627000	an annual sequel for like 20 years or something
6627000	6629000	yeah, every year there's a damn Madden game
6629000	6631000	well it started as a game called John Madden Football
6631000	6633000	and it was originally what?
6633000	6635000	it was on the Commodore 64
6635000	6637000	the Apple II, it was on DOS systems
6637000	6639000	all the way back in 1988
6639000	6641000	it was the first John Madden Football
6641000	6643000	and you can kind of tell because like in this little like
6643000	6645000	horrible pixelated screenshot
6645000	6647000	that was the extent of the Commodore 64 graphics
6647000	6649000	back in the day, like look how pixelated he is
6649000	6651000	and also his hair is not totally
6651000	6653000	grey, I mean clearly that's toupee
6653000	6655000	but it's not like totally freaking grey
6655000	6657000	so you know this is a long
6657000	6659000	old game, well my point with
6659000	6661000	this here is that Robin
6661000	6663000	Antonick who created the very
6663000	6665000	first game, and you see his name there in the programming
6665000	6667000	there, in Madden
6667000	6669000	apparently
6669000	6671000	23 years after this very first game
6671000	6673000	he is not seeing
6673000	6675000	any revenue from it
6675000	6677000	now he has filed suit against
6677000	6679000	Electronic Arts for tens of millions in royalties
6679000	6681000	and apparently
6681000	6683000	he was responsible for the development of
6683000	6685000	virtually all the groundbreaking technology
6685000	6687000	at the heart of the game, that's at least
6687000	6689000	what he claims in his suit
6689000	6691000	EA has not paid this guy
6691000	6693000	any royalties since
6693000	6695000	1992
6695000	6697000	was the last time he got royalties
6697000	6699000	interesting, I mean
6699000	6701000	he did make the original game, it was
6701000	6703000	kinda his baby, I mean I'm
6703000	6705000	sure the game has changed many times since
6705000	6707000	then, something you may not know, John
6707000	6709000	Madden football did not have actual NFL
6709000	6711000	teams, they didn't have the NFL license at the time
6711000	6713000	EA got that years later
6713000	6715000	so you know you could say
6715000	6717000	the game's changed a whole fuck ton since
6717000	6719000	the beginning, so maybe this guy doesn't deserve
6719000	6721000	anything, well yeah I mean it's
6721000	6723000	John Madden's namesake
6723000	6725000	that's the brand, you know
6725000	6727000	the actual announcer guy
6727000	6729000	but this person
6729000	6731000	Robin
6731000	6733000	sounds like he might have signed a bad contract
6733000	6735000	when they took the license from
6735000	6737000	him where he was paid up front for the
6737000	6739000	concept
6739000	6741000	of what it is, but I'd have to read more
6741000	6743000	about what the actual
6743000	6745000	the complaint that was filed in court
6745000	6747000	I would need to read that to know
6747000	6749000	how reasonable this is
6749000	6751000	yeah, but
6751000	6753000	it's gonna be interesting, I mean especially
6753000	6755000	with such a huge franchise to see
6755000	6757000	kinda what happens with this, but you know
6757000	6759000	a lot of times, especially back in the day
6759000	6761000	I mean back in the 80's, you know this was
6761000	6763000	always a huge thing where programmers
6763000	6765000	really weren't getting the credit they deserved
6765000	6767000	I mean that was why Activision was kinda
6767000	6769000	formed in the first place, it was a bunch of
6769000	6771000	people really upset that programmers didn't
6771000	6773000	get more credit in Atari games
6773000	6775000	the very first Easter egg
6775000	6777000	in a video game was where
6777000	6779000	the dude's initials were in Adventure
6779000	6781000	that was so that the guy could kinda sneak
6781000	6783000	his credit in there, because Atari never
6783000	6785000	credited their programmers and game designers
6785000	6787000	but Activision, remember the names like
6787000	6789000	David Crane and so forth, these guys would make the games
6789000	6791000	and get to put their names on them, because a lot of
6791000	6793000	these Atari games were by like one guy
6793000	6795000	or two guys
6795000	6797000	and they're cool guys
6797000	6799000	ET, worst Atari 2600
6799000	6801000	game of all time, according to some people
6801000	6803000	was done by a guy called Howard Scott Warshaw
6803000	6805000	you know why else he's famous?
6805000	6807000	He also made Yara's Revenge, made one of the best games
6807000	6809000	he's one of the worst games, go figure
6809000	6811000	you should read about how he was
6811000	6813000	under all that pressure to make ET, it really makes
6813000	6815000	a lot of sense as to why that game didn't come out so well
6815000	6817000	Pac-Man was
6817000	6819000	one guy too that wanted
6819000	6821000	to put it on a bigger cartridge, but Atari wouldn't let him
6821000	6823000	because it would cost too much, that's why it sucked
6823000	6825000	so
6825000	6827000	that's so bad, it's like the worst port ever
6827000	6829000	but it's so funny because you play the old school
6829000	6831000	Pac-Man on the 2600 and it really
6831000	6833000	is garbage, but then they had a Miss Pac-Man
6833000	6835000	later, it was great
6835000	6837000	for an Atari game, it was great
6837000	6839000	well the reason why is because the
6839000	6841000	Miss Pac-Man was on like a 4K cart
6841000	6843000	whereas the Pac-Man was on like half that
6843000	6845000	maybe a quarter of that, I don't know
6845000	6847000	so like, the whole drawing one
6847000	6849000	ghost every frame, why the ghost
6849000	6851000	flickered so terribly, that was a restriction
6851000	6853000	of the cartridge, I mean think about it
6853000	6855000	those programmers had 2K
6855000	6857000	to design an entire
6857000	6859000	game, 2K
6859000	6861000	is how long an SA is, you know, it's
6861000	6863000	crazy
6863000	6865000	anyhow
6865000	6867000	boy, we
6867000	6869000	should get into classic gaming discussion a lot on this
6869000	6871000	show, it's pretty good, alright, it's cause we love it
6871000	6873000	we do, uh, and we're old
6873000	6875000	um, Dark
6875000	6877000	Sakura, Wii, what do you mean
6877000	6879000	Wii, I'm sorry, especially Dark
6879000	6881000	Sakura, hey, don't make me break
6881000	6883000	out the vuvuzela
6883000	6885000	how about I break out another new story
6885000	6887000	well, Monolith
6887000	6889000	Soft's putting out the Wii
6889000	6891000	RPG Xenoblade, and it's being
6891000	6893000	localized, for
6893000	6895000	Europe, yay
6895000	6897000	um,
6897000	6899000	it's actually going up for
6899000	6901000	Xenoblade Chronicles, that
6901000	6903000	um, although the trailer itself is
6903000	6905000	untranslated
6905000	6907000	it shows basically all of the imagery
6907000	6909000	going out, um, Nintendo
6909000	6911000	of Europe put out a press release
6911000	6913000	and then removed it
6913000	6915000	um, but somebody
6915000	6917000	actually managed to get it out and get the information
6917000	6919000	out, and it's supposed to, uh, have
6919000	6921000	English and Japanese voice action
6921000	6923000	uh, voice, uh, options
6923000	6925000	so
6925000	6927000	maybe we'll get it
6927000	6929000	here too? I'm assuming if they're gonna
6929000	6931000	spend the time to translate into English that they're
6931000	6933000	gonna release it in not
6933000	6935000	more than one region, I mean, they gotta
6935000	6937000	what if there's like an elevator in the game
6937000	6939000	and they call it a lift? Americans
6939000	6941000	might not understand, oh my god, where will they
6941000	6943000	find that one employee to type
6943000	6945000	elevator?
6945000	6947000	Woo, that was a day's work, there
6947000	6949000	what if somebody in the
6949000	6951000	game, maybe there's a smoking scene and the guy
6951000	6953000	says he's gonna go out and have a fag
6953000	6955000	and that could never go over here in the
6955000	6957000	US, because like, you know, Glatt will sue
6957000	6959000	once again, you know, that same employee
6959000	6961000	on day two could easily type
6961000	6963000	cigarette
6963000	6965000	this looks pretty good though, or maybe they're gonna
6965000	6967000	go out and have a crumpet and people will be like
6967000	6969000	they don't know what the fuck that is over in the United
6969000	6971000	States, pants versus trousers, people
6971000	6973000	will just burst into tears, exactly
6973000	6975000	my favorite one is the word fanny
6975000	6977000	it's not just a pack anymore
6977000	6979000	no, fanny
6979000	6981000	here is your butt, there, the vag
6981000	6983000	oh my, is that why
6983000	6985000	a fanny pack is really in the front?
6985000	6987000	a friend of mine explained that
6987000	6989000	to me, of course, well, you know why I always
6989000	6991000	giggle when I pass the catering place, because
6991000	6993000	it's called Randy Peters?
6993000	6995000	because Randy is like horny
6995000	6997000	oh, I get it, oh
6997000	6999000	you're a nerd, alright
6999000	7001000	I wanna get to
7001000	7003000	some old comments from our chat room, it was on
7003000	7005000	the last story, but my bad, we
7005000	7007000	didn't get around to this here
7007000	7009000	let's see, GameGuru
7009000	7011000	in response to the whole Madden lawsuit
7011000	7013000	thing said, all EA has to do is prove
7013000	7015000	that his code was not used after 1992
7015000	7017000	or that the contract
7017000	7019000	with them was only valid until 1992
7019000	7021000	Spazernator
7021000	7023000	says, yet Activision no longer gives
7023000	7025000	credits and manuals anymore, oh the irony
7025000	7027000	and DarkToaGak follows that up
7027000	7029000	with what the fuck is a game manual
7029000	7031000	I thought they did have
7031000	7033000	credits and game manuals, they're just like all the way in the back
7033000	7035000	they do, and then EA
7035000	7037000	EA doesn't have manuals anymore
7037000	7039000	from what I remember, really, they're all
7039000	7041000	digital, it's all online now, digital manuals
7041000	7043000	it's all on the disc, I think you just have to make
7043000	7045000	the information available
7045000	7047000	this game looks super pretty by the way
7047000	7049000	oh, the Xenoblade, yeah, yeah it looks
7049000	7051000	pretty cool, it doesn't look like a Wii game
7051000	7053000	that's for sure, alright
7053000	7055000	just a couple more stories before we get to the mailbag
7055000	7057000	mailbag.orangelaungeradio.com is where
7057000	7059000	we invite you guys to email us every week
7059000	7061000	we talked a little bit about how there was a
7061000	7063000	PlayStation 1 emulator for Android
7063000	7065000	and how, you know, that may
7065000	7067000	interfere with the PlayStation phone
7067000	7069000	since, you know, anybody could just download ROMs
7069000	7071000	and play them on there
7071000	7073000	yeah, except that, you know, Sony decided
7073000	7075000	hey, you know what, we got this PlayStation
7075000	7077000	phone coming out, so
7077000	7079000	ahhhh, let's get it removed
7079000	7081000	so PSX4Droid
7081000	7083000	was removed from the Android marketplace
7083000	7085000	without warning due to
7085000	7087000	a content policy violation
7087000	7089000	um, he's
7089000	7091000	I guess, are, you know, saying
7091000	7093000	what the hell, he's expecting, he
7093000	7095000	figured it was from the, you know,
7095000	7097000	Xperia Play coming out, but also
7097000	7099000	that it's a little weird seeing as
7099000	7101000	there's other, um
7101000	7103000	another emulator already
7103000	7105000	on there, FPSC
7105000	7107000	that's still on the marketplace
7107000	7109000	so he's like, what the hell
7109000	7111000	um, and he couldn't be more right
7111000	7113000	that that was pretty much the reason
7113000	7115000	why they removed it, because the day after
7115000	7117000	it was removed, PlayStation 1
7117000	7119000	games started appearing on the Android marketplace
7119000	7121000	and of course, they were limited to the
7121000	7123000	Xperia Play
7123000	7125000	and the initial offerings, of course, were
7125000	7127000	Cool Borders 2, Destruction
7127000	7129000	Derby, Jumping Flash
7129000	7131000	Medieval 2, and Siphon Filter
7131000	7133000	and, uh,
7133000	7135000	all those are available for
7135000	7137000	$6 or $3.99
7137000	7139000	and, uh, I guess it's the same
7139000	7141000	price that they're going on the
7141000	7143000	PlayStation ork right now
7143000	7145000	um,
7145000	7147000	it is kind of, uh, funny that I
7147000	7149000	guess they're saying that, um
7149000	7151000	I don't
7151000	7153000	know, I would think
7155000	7157000	I thought the marketplace for Android was
7157000	7159000	open, I mean, if you can't get your app
7159000	7161000	on the Android marketplace, I mean, there's other
7161000	7163000	marketplaces out there where you can
7163000	7165000	I don't know
7165000	7167000	upload it somewhere else and someone can download it from
7167000	7169000	that website, am I correct, I think?
7169000	7171000	Because I know they have the Amazon marketplace
7171000	7173000	now, and obviously that's not on the Android
7173000	7175000	marketplace
7175000	7177000	I don't know, iPhone's
7177000	7179000	all different. They're all, oh yeah, everyone in here
7179000	7181000	is an iPhone already. Yeah, I know, so sorry
7181000	7183000	don't mean to be ignorant, but it's how it is
7183000	7185000	Well, I mean, that sucks
7185000	7187000	I guess, but, you know, it makes sense because
7187000	7189000	obviously, you know, if there's a free PlayStation
7189000	7191000	or even a PlayStation emulator
7191000	7193000	that you can buy and then download the ROMs
7193000	7195000	for, that would kind of defeat
7195000	7197000	the point of having to buy
7197000	7199000	you know, all
7199000	7201000	these different games
7201000	7203000	and, you know, if it is anything
7203000	7205000	like a normal Android phone
7205000	7207000	people really want to, since it is
7207000	7209000	legal to jailbreak your phone
7209000	7211000	you could jailbreak or root your phone
7211000	7213000	and download this anyways
7213000	7215000	and... But really, why play a PlayStation
7215000	7217000	game on your phone?
7217000	7219000	Well, why buy a phone that's meant
7219000	7221000	for playing PlayStation games
7221000	7223000	if you're not going to play PlayStation games
7223000	7225000	better yet, why buy a phone
7225000	7227000	to play PlayStation games? I'm not sure
7227000	7229000	I don't know, I guess it's really not that different
7229000	7231000	than the PSP when all is said and done, but I don't know
7231000	7233000	I know, but... I guess that
7233000	7235000	when I think playing games on my phone
7235000	7237000	I think that the horrible
7237000	7239000	horrible touchscreen
7239000	7241000	controls on the iPod
7241000	7243000	iPhone, that only very few
7243000	7245000	games get right, like, I hate
7245000	7247000	the whole, like, static button
7247000	7249000	like, trying to put a layer of button thing
7249000	7251000	on the screen, expect that to work, because it doesn't
7251000	7253000	like, games like Mega Man 2 and stuff are just fucking
7253000	7255000	terrible, you know, and I think of like
7255000	7257000	how the fuck are you supposed to play a PlayStation game
7257000	7259000	with that type of setup, but then I forget
7259000	7261000	oh yeah, these Xperia plays and stuff, they actually have buttons
7261000	7263000	they're meant, they're like PSPs
7263000	7265000	but they actually work as phones, so that makes a lot more
7265000	7267000	sense to me. But
7267000	7269000	I don't know, I mean, it's not like this thing
7269000	7271000	plays PSP games
7271000	7273000	it plays PlayStation 1 games, I mean
7273000	7275000	really, who's really... Your PSP
7275000	7277000	will play PlayStation 1 games too. Exactly, I mean
7277000	7279000	if you really want something to play
7279000	7281000	PlayStation 1 games on, seriously
7281000	7283000	go find a generation 1
7283000	7285000	PSP, oh my god
7285000	7287000	that would probably be pretty dirt cheap
7287000	7289000	or go to a
7289000	7291000	farmer's market
7291000	7293000	auction thing that has the, you know
7293000	7295000	I'm thinking like, Denio is here locally, but
7295000	7297000	PlayStation's everywhere
7297000	7299000	there are PSPs everywhere, and if you
7299000	7301000	really... Even the actual PlayStation 1s
7301000	7303000	I wouldn't, yeah
7303000	7305000	yeah, PlayStation 1s, but I mean
7305000	7307000	on the go, I mean PlayStation 1's not very
7307000	7309000	you know, portable
7309000	7311000	I mean, you could technically do it
7311000	7313000	with a battery pack and stuff, but it's
7313000	7315000	I seem to remember some little screen
7315000	7317000	they have the screen, no, they do have
7317000	7319000	the screen, and they're used for hacking
7319000	7321000	stuff quite a bit, they're definitely
7321000	7323000	used for portable consoles
7323000	7325000	more than the actual, you know
7325000	7327000	PlayStation 1, but I mean seriously
7327000	7329000	you just buy a PSP and just play your
7329000	7331000	PlayStation 1 games on there if you really want to do it
7331000	7333000	and that way you don't get locked into a contract and you don't
7333000	7335000	need to buy this expensive phone for it
7335000	7337000	but I mean, people like gaming on the
7337000	7339000	phone, and here's my
7339000	7341000	thing, it's like, you know, it's good
7341000	7343000	that they have these buttons, but are all
7343000	7345000	the developers really using it? No, they
7345000	7347000	are not, so, you know, don't expect
7347000	7349000	to buy this and go all of a sudden, oh hey, now I can
7349000	7351000	play Mega Man 2 or something like that
7351000	7353000	really easily
7353000	7355000	using the buttons, because you're
7355000	7357000	not going to be able to
7357000	7359000	I don't know, it's
7359000	7361000	whatever, I mean
7361000	7363000	if you want to do this, this is something for you
7363000	7365000	just, you know, know it's out there now
7365000	7367000	Misty in our chatroom says, speaking of
7367000	7369000	iPhones, someone needs to get theirs away from a mic
7369000	7371000	Jamie
7371000	7373000	I'm dealing something with Dan
7373000	7375000	oh, well still, it's
7375000	7377000	I moved it, look, it's over here
7377000	7379000	and you know, whenever
7379000	7381000	anybody hears that doo doo doo tone
7381000	7383000	like everybody looks at their, any iPhone owner
7383000	7385000	whenever that, there's some commercial on the radio
7385000	7387000	that uses that tone and it's terrible
7387000	7389000	I don't do that because my volume on my
7389000	7391000	iPod is turned off, and also
7391000	7393000	my iPod is turned off
7393000	7395000	like a normal person would
7395000	7397000	iPhone people
7397000	7399000	crazy
7399000	7401000	well, maybe my mommy needs to contact me
7401000	7403000	in an emergency
7403000	7405000	my husband's two states away, so
7405000	7407000	I'm trying to keep in touch with him
7407000	7409000	no, I understand that, that's no problem, but I'm just saying, you know
7411000	7413000	yeah, I don't know what you're saying, alright
7415000	7417000	alright, let's move on to another story about
7417000	7419000	Ultima, I mentioned earlier in the show
7419000	7421000	Ultima Online randomly got brought up
7421000	7423000	well, there are some rumors going around
7423000	7425000	that Ultima could quite possibly be coming back
7425000	7427000	but I don't know, this is stretching a little bit guys
7427000	7429000	here's the deal, Ultima 4
7429000	7431000	has been available online
7431000	7433000	through these various websites
7433000	7435000	Abandonware or Flash
7435000	7437000	emulators and so forth, GOG maybe
7437000	7439000	yeah, well no, not even GOG, I'm talking like
7439000	7441000	illegal means to play
7441000	7443000	Ultima 4, but you know how like a lot of that
7443000	7445000	Abandonware, the whole theory behind it is
7445000	7447000	well, after so many, even though it's like total
7447000	7449000	BS, after so many years you lose the right
7449000	7451000	no, companies don't ever lose the rights to them
7451000	7453000	it's just that they just bank on
7453000	7455000	people are going to stop caring after
7455000	7457000	7 or 8 years or whatever the Abandonware sites say
7457000	7459000	well, I guess these sites were hosting
7459000	7461000	Ultima 4, and sites have been
7461000	7463000	giving away that game
7463000	7465000	since like the late 90's
7465000	7467000	this game dates all the way back to 1985
7467000	7469000	there was a version of it on the NES
7469000	7471000	and that was one of the later releases
7471000	7473000	Ultima 4 is an old ass game
7473000	7475000	well, apparently what happened
7475000	7477000	is that some of these sites that were hosting the game
7477000	7479000	EA had them take
7479000	7481000	down, there was like some
7481000	7483000	cease and desist that went out there
7483000	7485000	now, some people are thinking
7485000	7487000	it's tied into this whole
7487000	7489000	thing that Paul Barnett
7489000	7491000	who is a creative director
7491000	7493000	at BioWare and Mythic, he's a very
7493000	7495000	RPG centered guy, he's been talking about a
7495000	7497000	secret project which includes
7497000	7499000	an all new MMO from EA
7499000	7501000	so could it be that
7501000	7503000	EA is trying to protect this old IP
7503000	7505000	all of a sudden because
7505000	7507000	they're about to announce a new Ultima MMO
7507000	7509000	at E3, who knows
7509000	7511000	so of course
7511000	7513000	as brought up earlier in the show, Ultima Online
7513000	7515000	has been out since 1997
7515000	7517000	so it is a 14 year old game
7517000	7519000	so maybe it's going to get an update
7519000	7521000	and that could also explain this whole loyalty program thing
7521000	7523000	coming out of the blue it seems like
7523000	7525000	maybe like a last hurrah for Ultima Online
7525000	7527000	before they're about to announce something big
7527000	7529000	at E3, who knows
7529000	7531000	and the last time that we heard something
7531000	7533000	about this happening
7533000	7535000	was the Sarian games
7535000	7537000	that had all the Space Quest and King's Quest
7537000	7539000	for Sierra Online available to play
7539000	7541000	and then the
7541000	7543000	the fandom game
7543000	7545000	I'm blanking on the name
7545000	7547000	Silver Lining, they got a C&D
7547000	7549000	and we thought oh it's just you know
7549000	7551000	Activision being horrible
7551000	7553000	but no the Telltale
7553000	7555000	Telltale got the King's Quest
7555000	7557000	revamp license
7557000	7559000	and it's like oh well maybe they weren't just being
7559000	7561000	total assholes, there's actually a relevant reason
7561000	7563000	for them to do those C&Ds
7563000	7565000	because that happened just one or two months ago
7565000	7567000	that gives me reason to believe
7567000	7569000	this Ultima story can hold water
7569000	7571000	very good point
7571000	7573000	well we'll see what happens, I think E3 will be very telling
7573000	7575000	this could be one of the big things they announce
7575000	7577000	would there be interest in Ultima?
7577000	7579000	Ultima was, that was a big Richard Garriott thing too
7579000	7581000	remember that was like his baby
7581000	7585000	I didn't actually own my own gaming PC
7585000	7587000	or a PC period until like
7587000	7589000	95, 96
7589000	7591000	so all the Ultima stuff that came before
7591000	7593000	I personally missed out on all of the Ultima stuff
7593000	7595000	during the 80s
7595000	7597000	see I owned 3 and 4 on the NES
7597000	7599000	I owned both of them on the NES
7599000	7601000	and they were great games
7601000	7603000	well they were really hardcore
7603000	7605000	they were not like Final Fantasy
7605000	7607000	they were pretty in depth
7607000	7609000	I think 3 had an amazing soundtrack too
7609000	7611000	weren't they off a model of Dungeons and Dragons?
7611000	7613000	Ultima Exodus
7613000	7615000	was 3
7615000	7617000	yeah because I tried playing that one
7617000	7619000	I had it on Ness
7619000	7621000	like the Cleric or the Druid
7621000	7623000	there was like a million classes in it
7623000	7625000	yeah that was Ultima and then there was Ultima Quest of the Avatar
7625000	7627000	which was a little more
7627000	7629000	but see those games are really not like their PC counterparts
7629000	7631000	they were really
7631000	7633000	I don't want to say dumbed down but they were really changed
7633000	7635000	for the NES
7635000	7637000	mine ended up under a lawn mower
7637000	7639000	not my fault
7639000	7641000	poor game
7641000	7643000	I found it in my front yard after
7643000	7645000	trying to find it and it was under a lawn mower
7645000	7647000	there was Ultima 5
7647000	7649000	on the NES as well
7649000	7651000	and I think Ultima 7 I played on the PC
7651000	7653000	that was Pagan right?
7653000	7655000	there was one big one that
7655000	7657000	7, 8 or 9 I don't know had a lot of hype
7657000	7659000	to it
7659000	7661000	well they all had some hype to them
7661000	7663000	but now Richard Garriott is long gone
7663000	7665000	he's not dead or anything
7665000	7667000	but he went off and did Tabula Rasa
7667000	7669000	which tanked unfortunately for him
7669000	7671000	that was the whole space MMO
7671000	7673000	it was not free
7673000	7675000	it was an NCSoft pay game
7675000	7677000	I played it once
7677000	7679000	it was alright but it was more like a shooter type game
7679000	7681000	and yeah that didn't go over so well
7681000	7683000	well maybe after that whole debacle
7683000	7685000	failed maybe he's coming back and doing this
7685000	7687000	who knows?
7687000	7689000	could be a variety of things
7689000	7691000	alright let's get to the mailbag
7691000	7693000	every week we invite your emails at
7693000	7695000	mailbag.orangelaungeradio.com
7695000	7697000	and our soccer is going to dive into the email bag head first
7697000	7699000	and pull out a couple emails that she thinks are worth
7699000	7701000	sharing with us tonight
7701000	7703000	I found some sticky ones
7703000	7705000	first email
7705000	7707000	last week you mentioned Sony changing over divisions
7707000	7709000	for their network services
7709000	7711000	I oddly got an email regarding this change
7711000	7713000	but the contents of the email smelled of a phishing scam
7713000	7715000	the sender appears to be from
7715000	7717000	playstation underscore network
7717000	7719000	at playstation dot
7719000	7721000	enovix dot net
7721000	7723000	I haven't followed the links in the email
7723000	7725000	which simply mentions the change
7725000	7727000	the need to enter into new terms of service
7727000	7729000	and the link where my Sony online services settings
7729000	7731000	can be updated
7731000	7733000	the change has been confirmed as being legitimate
7733000	7735000	am I simply being paranoid about this email
7735000	7737000	Robert M
7737000	7739000	no I think you have a right to question those types of emails
7739000	7741000	exactly and also I don't think
7741000	7743000	that they are actually having you agree to those terms
7743000	7745000	of services through
7745000	7747000	through that I got an email
7747000	7749000	I think I just ignored it
7749000	7751000	because I did get an email but the
7751000	7753000	minute I went back into the PS3 I played PS3
7753000	7755000	just a couple days ago I think after the first
7755000	7757000	because this is when we were playing Mortal Combat
7757000	7759000	it was Friday right? and it made me
7759000	7761000	accept the terms of service when I signed in
7761000	7763000	so that will all happen through your
7763000	7765000	playstation so don't do anything with
7765000	7767000	email I was watching Supernatural on
7767000	7769000	Friday night and it didn't have
7769000	7771000	me do anything
7771000	7773000	maybe you weren't connecting
7773000	7775000	to the interwebs idk
7775000	7777000	might be
7777000	7779000	ok next email
7779000	7781000	note
7781000	7783000	the following letter has been mirrored posted to the
7783000	7785000	Sims 3 online forums
7785000	7787000	and this is also titled by the way
7787000	7789000	empirical response to the Dragon Age 2 protest letter
7789000	7791000	dear sirs
7791000	7793000	in the past week I've been playing a lot of the game
7793000	7795000	The Sims 3 on my iPad
7795000	7797000	I like most of the game however there is one element of the game
7797000	7799000	that absolutely offends me
7799000	7801000	in the game you can make different meals for yourself
7801000	7803000	and whoever you happen to be living with
7803000	7805000	at the point in the game
7805000	7807000	among the meal options you can choose from
7807000	7809000	is vegetable soup
7809000	7811000	this option deeply offends me
7811000	7813000	as an ardent carnivore I eat meat with every meal
7813000	7815000	every! I eat meat with breakfast
7815000	7817000	meat with lunch, meat with afternoon snack, meat with dinner
7817000	7819000	meat with my late night snack
7819000	7821000	I eat meat like it's going out of style which after
7821000	7823000	going to my local whole foods it just might be
7823000	7825000	the option of eating vegetable soup
7825000	7827000	offends me as I feel meat should be not
7827000	7829000	only an option of what to eat at meals
7829000	7831000	it should be THE option
7831000	7833000	now why should you listen to me? what does my opinion matter?
7833000	7835000	my opinion matters because as a ginger
7835000	7837000	mere asthmatic pudgy impotent male
7837000	7839000	I represent the majority of gamers
7839000	7841000	and if I don't fuck it my opinion
7841000	7843000	is sacrosanct and my mommy
7843000	7845000	says I'm special
7845000	7847000	I make this promise, if The Sims 3 is not updated
7847000	7849000	to take the portion of eating vegetable soup
7849000	7851000	out of the game I will post an online petition
7851000	7853000	that will surely be signed by many of the gamers
7853000	7855000	who identify and agree with me
7855000	7857000	online petitions are no joke, think of all the things
7857000	7859000	that have changed because of online petitions
7859000	7861000	think of it, you're truly redertainment
7861000	7863000	satire over
7863000	7865000	this message has been brought to you by the tachymeter
7865000	7867000	that collection of numbers
7867000	7869000	on the outside of your
7869000	7871000	tachometer
7871000	7873000	that you have no idea what the fuck it's there for
7873000	7875000	tachymeter is on your car
7875000	7877000	to show you your rpms, right?
7877000	7879000	so
7879000	7881000	yeah, I thought the parody though
7881000	7883000	was pretty funny, I mean it's
7883000	7885000	pretty right on
7885000	7887000	I lulled
7887000	7889000	so what's the name of the guy from Bioware that did that old
7889000	7891000	the David
7891000	7893000	David something
7893000	7895000	Spader?
7895000	7897000	no, that's an actor
7897000	7899000	yeah, he's an actor
7899000	7901000	there's an online petition
7901000	7903000	to get him fired because
7903000	7905000	I guess the same
7905000	7907000	sex options the NPCs in Dragon
7907000	7909000	Age 2, whether it be the female
7909000	7911000	what's her name, the Meryl?
7911000	7913000	yeah, well the
7913000	7915000	elf girl Meryl, yeah
7915000	7917000	and then also the male equivalent which I guess are the easier
7917000	7919000	options to hit on if you want to do
7919000	7921000	well I guess the person that put up this
7921000	7923000	petition is like, oh well this is just
7923000	7925000	stereotyping
7925000	7927000	gay and lesbian men and women as
7927000	7929000	aggressive sex
7929000	7931000	fiends but I think Meryl
7931000	7933000	will hit on you no matter what gender you
7933000	7935000	are okay, but just
7935000	7937000	and so will, I think
7937000	7939000	is Varick the dwarf
7939000	7941000	guy? yeah, I think they're just
7941000	7943000	set to be attracted to
7943000	7945000	the main person yeah
7945000	7947000	but I just thought it was funny that
7947000	7949000	he had put out that response to that
7949000	7951000	one idiot guy who wrote in
7951000	7953000	but there's also just a petition to get him
7953000	7955000	fired because I guess the gay and lesbian characters are
7955000	7957000	horny that's butt-tarded
7957000	7959000	if anyone's horny
7959000	7961000	it's Isabella I found it
7961000	7963000	here's the petition, it's on petition
7963000	7965000	spot.com please don't visit it
7965000	7967000	it says fire David Gator for
7967000	7989000	stereotyping gays
7997000	7999000	at me when I never found any interest
7999000	8001000	or even flirted with him this sort of thing shows
8001000	8003000	that gays are unable to be normal people
8003000	8005000	think nothing about sex
8005000	8007000	this is the type of garbage that has people
8007000	8009000	believe gays shouldn't serve in the military
8009000	8011000	we are human beings that
8011000	8013000	are the same as everyone else please sign
8013000	8015000	this petition if you wish that Dragon Age
8015000	8017000	senior writer David Gator should be fired

8021000	8023000	because get this if
8023000	8025000	say we have, I'm just gonna use
8025000	8027000	Meryl for example and she's
8027000	8029000	hitting on my female rogue
8029000	8031000	but in the male scenario she hits on
8031000	8033000	the male rogue too and you
8033000	8035000	reject her is that going to make her like
8035000	8037000	you anymore is it gonna make her a little bit upset with you
8037000	8039000	it doesn't matter
8039000	8041000	gender she's still hitting on whoever

8145000	8147000	have a problem with what you're doing
8147000	8149000	this is people looking for drama where there is none
8149000	8151000	it's like what is so boring
8151000	8153000	in your life that you have to make drama to be upset
8153000	8155000	about seriously
8155000	8157000	the world is not about you
8157000	8159000	my favorite though is that there are totally people
8159000	8161000	trolling that particular like half of the signatures
8161000	8163000	well there was one that I wanted you to read but it was obviously
8163000	8165000	a troll one it was like some gay dude
8165000	8167000	that wants to get
8167000	8169000	boned every day or something it was I don't know
8169000	8171000	funny

8175000	8177000	hello olr first off I want to let you know that I'm typing
8177000	8179000	this on my iphone so if there are any weird
8179000	8181000	words it's probably autocorrect
8181000	8183000	ok
8183000	8185000	a while ago I emailed asking
8185000	8187000	if either the olr crew or
8187000	8189000	anyone in the chat room knew of any video game
8189000	8191000	characters who wear knitted clothing like
8191000	8193000	riku scarf in final fantasy 10 2
8193000	8195000	or nora estheim's
8195000	8197000	sweater in final fantasy 13
8197000	8199000	I'm still looking for suggestions
8199000	8201000	but I found another character
8201000	8203000	final fantasy 3's lunath some purple sweater
8203000	8205000	under his jacket that's true
8205000	8207000	sky requested that I send some
8207000	8209000	pics of past projects I've included some of
8209000	8211000	my past works the gray afghan I'm working
8211000	8213000	on now and that green scarf
8213000	8215000	also doubled as a shawl for this
8215000	8217000	petite model I'm looking forward
8217000	8219000	for suggestions on video
8219000	8221000	game characters knitted attire so let me know you should
8221000	8223000	totally knit me stuff
8223000	8225000	can you knit a mobius scarf?
8225000	8227000	cause I totally want one anyway
8227000	8229000	on a completely random note the other night I had
8229000	8231000	a really screwed up dream where the three olr
8231000	8233000	hosts were included oh I don't know
8233000	8235000	I'm afraid for some reason we were
8235000	8237000	in some everglades slash marsh looking
8237000	8239000	place and me and dark sakura
8239000	8241000	were in one dune buggy and loki and sky were
8241000	8243000	in another following us a building
8243000	8245000	to our left exploded like a balloon filled with
8245000	8247000	water as we drove by it for some
8247000	8249000	reason they veered off the path and were following
8249000	8251000	a higher path that swerved in and out of the main
8251000	8253000	that we were on
8253000	8255000	there was a small ditch in the path
8255000	8257000	and we fell a little and hit a curb
8257000	8259000	and achieved some air time like we were in
8259000	8261000	some dukes of hazard chase
8261000	8263000	all four of us eventually reached our path
8263000	8265000	which was my parents home
8265000	8267000	which was bizarre cause they were white and I'm filipino
8267000	8269000	we started
8269000	8271000	getting chewed up by mosquitoes which
8271000	8273000	woke I guess which means
8273000	8275000	I woke up all itchy for some reason
8275000	8277000	yeah I know totally random thanks
8277000	8279000	for humoring me stan
8279000	8281000	don't eat
8281000	8283000	before you go to bed
8283000	8285000	they make you dream
8285000	8287000	weird shit or don't take night
8287000	8289000	don't sleep with night quilt
8289000	8291000	tonight on the
8291000	8293000	orange lounge radio knitting and crocheting
8293000	8295000	video game show we're gonna
8295000	8297000	talk about how to knit
8297000	8299000	a nice little scarf no I think this stuff is
8299000	8301000	kinda neat actually
8301000	8303000	we're there taking this
8303000	8305000	one step further into the
8305000	8307000	whole you know
8307000	8309000	making tangible
8309000	8311000	goods from video game inspired
8311000	8313000	stuff and I know dark soccer you're really into
8313000	8315000	this I'm surprised there aren't more people
8315000	8317000	that kinda like crochet the whole like
8317000	8319000	8 bit patterns using the
8319000	8321000	old sprite graphics to like
8321000	8323000	make those what are those things the
8323000	8325000	needle point or whatever this is gonna be a
8325000	8327000	beret yeah but I'm
8327000	8329000	talking about like can't you like stitch a
8329000	8331000	like sprite into those
8331000	8333000	um you theoretically
8333000	8335000	could on a crocheted item you just need
8335000	8337000	the grid but um Becky does
8337000	8339000	um needle point
8339000	8341000	and then there's cross stitch
8341000	8343000	I think in a recent issue
8343000	8345000	of the official World of Warcraft
8345000	8347000	magazine they feature a fan
8347000	8349000	who does handmade plushies
8349000	8351000	that are very intricate and exquisitely
8351000	8353000	done she's not allowed to sell
8353000	8355000	them but because they're so good
8355000	8357000	they gave her a pictorial in the
8357000	8359000	magazine so she makes like moonkin plushies
8359000	8361000	and oh cute she cuts out the
8361000	8363000	fabric and does it all I want a walrus
8363000	8365000	person whatever they're called
8365000	8367000	kolok or whatever

8483000	8485000	as of the time I typed this on Thursday afternoon
8485000	8487000	there's no notable free videos on the
8487000	8489000	PSN video store
8489000	8491000	if something were to be added between now and when
8491000	8493000	the OLR airs
8493000	8495000	or the OLR now
8495000	8497000	I'll mention it either in chat or via Twitter topics
8497000	8499000	although there's nothing good
8499000	8501000	that's free so far I should mention
8501000	8503000	that the PSN video store does have
8503000	8505000	a petty decent
8505000	8507000	I'm sure you meant pretty decent
8507000	8509000	sale going on for the outright
8509000	8511000	purchase of
8511000	8513000	SD versions of miscellaneous comedy
8513000	8515000	movies such as Airplane, Disaster Movie
8515000	8517000	Joe Dirt, RV, Team America
8517000	8519000	several MST3K titles, etc.
8519000	8521000	as well as three stand-up
8521000	8523000	comedy specials and select seasons of Super
8523000	8525000	Jail, Aqua Teen Hunger Force
8525000	8527000	and the anime series called
8527000	8529000	Durarara the Complete Series
8529000	8531000	excuse you
8531000	8533000	the movies and stand-up specials are normally
8533000	8535000	$10 while the other stuff is normally
8535000	8537000	$2 but during the sale they're half
8537000	8539000	off
8539000	8541000	touch you
8541000	8543000	on the subject of video stores I've noticed that the
8543000	8545000	XBL-Zune video marketplace has been updated
8545000	8547000	to include a new tab specifically
8547000	8549000	for free TV shows, sneak previews, etc.
8549000	8551000	this should be very helpful
8551000	8553000	that stuff has been gooped
8553000	8555000	grouped together
8555000	8557000	in one place
8557000	8559000	rather than having to hunt around
8559000	8561000	for it at all
8561000	8563000	lastly I want to
8563000	8565000	touch on the PS3 version of Free Realms
8565000	8567000	which has been released via PSN this past
8567000	8569000	Tuesday although I haven't put enough time
8569000	8571000	into it to give a full fair review
8571000	8573000	of it I'd at least would like to give my
8573000	8575000	early impressions of it which are mixed
8575000	8577000	frankly there's a few couple
8577000	8579000	a few a couple things hurting it
8579000	8581000	was it a few or a couple?
8581000	8583000	the game seriously needs a manual be it
8583000	8585000	a PDF printed one or
8585000	8587000	in-game which isn't included
8587000	8589000	some things are easy to figure out while others are
8589000	8591000	bigger pain in the ass than an appointment with
8591000	8593000	one's proctologist
8593000	8595000	while the game is a
8595000	8597000	freemium title and trophies are supported
8597000	8599000	you must have a subscription to unlock any trophies
8599000	8601000	Sony kinda neglected to mention
8601000	8603000	that early on and the only time they really
8603000	8605000	said anything was in response to a question
8605000	8607000	in the comment section to a
8607000	8609000	post on the Playstation blog
8609000	8611000	in terms of the
8611000	8613000	game's overall appearance it can
8613000	8615000	best be described as if Mr. Rogers
8615000	8617000	had made a stew out of Barney the
8617000	8619000	Teletubbies most Nickelodeon cartoons and the Power Rangers
8619000	8621000	ate said stew then vomited
8621000	8623000	all over a unicorn a bunny
8623000	8625000	infested World of Warcraft
8625000	8627000	whether this is a positive or negative
8627000	8629000	is purely subjective and impersonal preference
8629000	8631000	this email has been brought to you
8631000	8633000	by Nyquil capital N small y big
8633000	8635000	fucking Q Nyquil Nyquil Nyquil
8635000	8637000	we love you you giant fucking Q
8637000	8639000	see Dark Sakura I can quote
8639000	8641000	Dennis Leary too
8641000	8643000	that's it
8643000	8645000	well
8645000	8647000	I guess somebody kind of agrees with me on
8647000	8649000	free realms
8649000	8651000	that it's a horrible
8651000	8653000	piece of crap game that makes
8653000	8655000	no sense that you have no
8655000	8657000	idea what to do not that there's anything wrong with that
8657000	8659000	no I'm kidding I call it the
8659000	8661000	sphincter of MMOs it's not the worst game
8661000	8663000	I've ever played but it's just not good
8663000	8665000	the sphincter of MMOs it's not
8665000	8667000	the crap that comes out I don't know if it's the sphincter
8667000	8669000	but it's definitely like the upper
8669000	8671000	intestine
8671000	8673000	well my reason for saying the sphincter
8673000	8675000	is because it's not the crap
8675000	8677000	it's just where the crap comes from
8677000	8679000	okay you win
8679000	8681000	let's get angsty
8681000	8683000	do some angry rawr
8683000	8701000	FUs of the week
8701000	8703000	my FU goes towards the
8703000	8705000	repaving of the sidewalk
8705000	8707000	the street outside of my house
8707000	8709000	because they're closing the street tomorrow
8709000	8711000	and Tuesday from
8711000	8713000	I wanna say 7 in the morning
8713000	8715000	until 5 in the afternoon
8715000	8717000	and
8717000	8719000	I really shouldn't have to leave my house
8719000	8721000	until like 9 to get to school
8721000	8723000	because I'm making up time at school
8723000	8725000	and instead I have to
8725000	8727000	park my house a block away at
8727000	8729000	my friend's house so that I could
8729000	8731000	walk to my car in the morning and then go to school
8731000	8733000	which is not that far I'm not complaining about walking
8733000	8735000	but I complain about
8735000	8737000	walking that I shouldn't have to do
8737000	8739000	they should do this like
8739000	8741000	at night
8741000	8743000	with sound mufflers around them
8745000	8747000	or they should give us money to be in communities
8747000	8749000	but I guess we're getting any road out of this whatever
8749000	8751000	money rocks
8751000	8753000	Loki!
8753000	8755000	um
8755000	8757000	I don't know there's not a whole lot that I'm really mad about
8757000	8759000	just I guess FU to lack of sleep
8759000	8761000	because I haven't been getting a lot of sleep
8761000	8763000	I have to wake up way early in the morning
8763000	8765000	and
8765000	8767000	you know one or two days isn't bad
8767000	8769000	I've been doing it for 8 months straight now
8769000	8771000	uh
8771000	8773000	it takes a toll on you it makes you go a little crazy
8773000	8775000	oh you were already
8775000	8777000	crazy Loki
8777000	8779000	I know and just compounded on top of that
8779000	8781000	um
8781000	8783000	I don't know I think it's been pretty good for me
8783000	8785000	I don't really have a lot to say FU to do
8785000	8787000	so yes FU to ants
8787000	8789000	oh little bastards
8789000	8791000	I hate them that's a good one thank you
8791000	8793000	how about you?
8793000	8795000	even if it's for really good reasons
8795000	8797000	like a new job
8797000	8799000	or you know
8799000	8801000	just a new beginning or whatever
8801000	8803000	the process of moving
8803000	8805000	as an adult is one of the most
8805000	8807000	annoying bullshitty things a grown
8807000	8809000	person can do to themselves
8809000	8811000	you've got to change your address
8811000	8813000	get the stupid postal
8813000	8815000	card pack up everything you own
8815000	8817000	get friends to help you move
8817000	8819000	even if
8819000	8821000	it's awesome and nothing goes wrong
8821000	8823000	moving is bullshit
8823000	8825000	there you go
8825000	8827000	moving is hard
8827000	8829000	it's for grown ups
8829000	8831000	no it stinks I don't like it
8831000	8833000	anyhow that's it for the FUs of the week
8833000	8835000	let's move on to a couple more stories
8835000	8837000	and then your calls at 1877
8837000	8839000	game OLR
8839000	8841000	as if we didn't need more
8841000	8843000	reasons to believe that there's gonna be
8843000	8845000	a new Grand Theft Auto announced at E3
8845000	8847000	uh
8847000	8849000	well there's been a casting call for
8849000	8851000	people to
8851000	8853000	do some character
8853000	8855000	voice over work and one of those
8855000	8857000	characters happens to be from the Grand Theft Auto
8857000	8859000	universe including
8859000	8861000	the guy's name is James
8861000	8863000	Pettison
8863000	8865000	and he was a
8865000	8867000	guess aside character
8867000	8869000	at least in San Andreas
8869000	8871000	where he openly
8871000	8873000	recounted acts of pedophilia
8873000	8875000	and in Grand Theft Auto 4
8875000	8877000	he was arrested by the Indonesian police
8877000	8879000	after being suspected of child molestation
8879000	8881000	in Bali
8881000	8883000	so
8883000	8885000	yeah now apparently
8885000	8887000	he's coming back in the next game and
8887000	8889000	someone's gonna be doing the voice for him
8889000	8891000	some other characters they name
8891000	8893000	as well they're pretty generic sounding
8893000	8895000	Samantha a young female
8895000	8897000	obsessed with sex parties always dreaming
8897000	8899000	of being a Hollywood celebrity
8899000	8901000	um
8901000	8903000	also let's see here
8903000	8905000	uh
8905000	8907000	uh
8907000	8909000	what else there were some other characters
8909000	8911000	I thought they were talking about too as well
8911000	8913000	um a lot of like weird stuff
8913000	8915000	um
8915000	8917000	but yeah so probably
8917000	8919000	new game coming out I would not be surprised
8919000	8921000	next year so
8921000	8923000	exciting I love it
8923000	8925000	and the rumor is
8925000	8927000	that it's supposed to be going back to Los Santos which
8927000	8929000	was from San Andreas probably
8929000	8931000	one of the best Grand Theft Auto games ever
8931000	8933000	so I think a new
8933000	8935000	Grand Theft Auto game is kind of a given so
8935000	8937000	San Andreas was an analog
8937000	8939000	of LA in that game
8939000	8941000	Los Santos was
8941000	8943000	Las Vegas or no? No, Los Santos
8943000	8945000	was part of San Andreas remember cause there's three
8945000	8947000	cities in San Andreas it was
8947000	8949000	Los Santos, San Friere
8949000	8951000	and Las Venturas
8951000	8953000	Las Vegas
8953000	8955000	yeah Vegas, San Francisco
8955000	8957000	and Los Angeles
8957000	8959000	yeah
8959000	8961000	but that game was massive
8961000	8963000	I have to really go back and play it
8963000	8965000	get back from my sister
8965000	8967000	why not wait for the next one?
8967000	8969000	if you have a gaming PC get it on
8969000	8971000	Steam for like five bucks and it's a lot better
8971000	8973000	I have it on PC the last
8973000	8975000	PC I tried running it on was my old laptop
8975000	8977000	and that thing is a piece of shit I could probably run it on this
8977000	8979000	really well
8979000	8981000	but you know I've got it on
8981000	8983000	I've got the old
8983000	8985000	hot coffee disc
8985000	8987000	from the Playstation 2
8987000	8989000	my sister's been borrowing it forever
8989000	8991000	and you know even though she doesn't need to
8991000	8993000	cause there's a rip on the hard drive of that Playstation 2
8993000	8995000	she has
8995000	8997000	so I just need to get back and play it on my
8997000	8999000	generation 1 Playstation 3 full backwards compatibility
8999000	9001000	oh yeah
9001000	9003000	alright
9003000	9005000	well one more story for you guys before we get to the phone calls
9005000	9007000	and this is about a man named Phil Fish
9007000	9009000	and you might not know that game
9009000	9011000	or you might not know that name but he is making the game
9011000	9013000	Fez it's an indie game
9013000	9015000	and it's going to be coming out on Xbox Live Arcade
9015000	9017000	possibly the PC and the Playstation 3
9017000	9019000	but probably not the Wii
9019000	9021000	in an interview with
9021000	9023000	Destructoid he was quoted saying
9023000	9025000	quote right now we're only concentrating
9025000	9027000	on XBLA which makes the most sense
9027000	9029000	for us at the time
9029000	9031000	PC and Playstation Network would also make a lot of sense
9031000	9033000	but in my opinion WiiWare just wouldn't be worth
9033000	9035000	our time and effort
9035000	9037000	it's a dismal system that I don't want to deal with
9037000	9039000	neither as a customer nor a developer
9039000	9041000	no demos? Fuck off
9041000	9043000	and that's a quote from this guy
9043000	9045000	who told the WiiWare system it can go fuck off
9045000	9047000	now granted this guy
9047000	9049000	I don't want to say he's a nobody
9049000	9051000	but his game hasn't really been proven yet
9051000	9053000	he's one of those garage developers
9053000	9055000	that Nintendo kind of doesn't want in their house anyway
9055000	9057000	so I don't know
9057000	9059000	if this story carries a lot of weight
9059000	9061000	but I mean the guy did kind of have
9061000	9063000	the balls to call out Nintendo
9063000	9065000	but I kind of think it's not going to
9065000	9067000	really change a goddamn thing in the scope of things
9067000	9069000	but he really does have a point
9069000	9071000	why do people keep developing for WiiWare when it's kind of shit?
9071000	9073000	exactly
9073000	9075000	and as I posted on Twitter
9075000	9077000	earlier this week
9077000	9079000	remember Nintendo was commenting
9079000	9081000	on how they wanted to make sure
9081000	9083000	they kept the garage developers out
9083000	9085000	because in order to make sure
9085000	9087000	that there's quality products coming out
9087000	9089000	on WiiWare and DSiWare
9089000	9091000	and stuff like that
9091000	9093000	guess what came out on DSiWare this week?
9093000	9095000	it was a program to take pictures of your friends
9095000	9097000	and put them in funny Halloween themed
9097000	9099000	backgrounds
9099000	9101000	it looked like shit
9101000	9103000	it looked like something that was on the iOS platform
9103000	9105000	yay, clip art
9105000	9107000	Halloween themed?
9107000	9109000	I'm sorry, monster themed stuff
9109000	9111000	I'm sorry, the best one on the iPhone
9111000	9113000	was that heroin
9113000	9115000	yeah, that was funny
9115000	9117000	the make your friends fat application
9117000	9119000	is funny too
9119000	9121000	it was absolutely terrible
9121000	9123000	and perfect week to come out
9123000	9125000	right after they said
9125000	9127000	oh, we need to make sure quality is on there
9127000	9129000	that's some quality shit right there
9129000	9131000	you're so much better
9131000	9133000	than the iOS platform, what was I thinking
9133000	9135000	even, you know, contemplating that you would
9135000	9137000	ever allow something that terrible to be on
9137000	9139000	your network
9139000	9141000	oh, Nintendo, you don't need these garage
9141000	9143000	developers at all, you got your Mario games
9143000	9145000	that you're rehashing and putting out
9145000	9147000	whatever, that's fine, they're better off
9147000	9149000	you know, not going to the WiiWare service
9149000	9151000	but seriously, I mean, come on
9151000	9153000	demos, I mean, demos have been around
9153000	9155000	for fucking years now, and you can't
9155000	9157000	implement demos on your WiiWare service
9157000	9159000	or you just don't want to because a lot of this shit
9159000	9161000	is crap on there, and
9161000	9163000	it's just terrible games
9163000	9165000	oh, haha, you downloaded it too late
9165000	9167000	hahaha, Nintendo just kinda doesn't get
9167000	9169000	online, I think it's the same story
9169000	9171000	every week, ok, they don't get online
9171000	9173000	and they don't have any demos
9173000	9175000	for Wii games, they don't have any
9175000	9177000	demos for any, I mean they had
9177000	9179000	demos one time for a select few
9179000	9181000	WiiWare games, so it is possible
9181000	9183000	they, eh, fuck it, we don't give a shit
9183000	9185000	our customers don't need demos
9185000	9187000	our quality speaks for itself
9187000	9189000	it should be a no brainer, I must buy everything
9189000	9191000	Nintendo
9191000	9193000	the developers of
9193000	9195000	Super Meat Boy, which I think is
9195000	9197000	one of the most successful indie games since
9197000	9199000	Braid really, the
9199000	9201000	two studios that were most willing to work with them
9201000	9203000	was XBLA and Steam
9203000	9205000	Sony wasn't really interested in the
9205000	9207000	game, and when they wanted to put out a
9207000	9209000	WiiWare edition of Super Meat Boy
9209000	9211000	they were fine with the no demo thing, but just the
9211000	9213000	restrictions they had to put on the game
9213000	9215000	really crippled it, they just cancelled the whole thing
9215000	9217000	because the WiiWare platform and how
9217000	9219000	big the game has to be was
9219000	9221000	shitty. I mean, this is a company
9221000	9223000	that thinks that users
9223000	9225000	can't understand megabytes, they
9225000	9227000	have to, you know, put it
9227000	9229000	down to blocks, yeah, really, how is
9229000	9231000	you know, five megabytes and
9231000	9233000	five blocks any fucking different, I mean
9233000	9235000	other than being really confusing
9235000	9237000	to the fact that how many, you know
9237000	9239000	When you have 64 and you take
9239000	9241000	away two, you're left with
9241000	9243000	62. Yeah, but then you have to figure
9243000	9245000	out, okay, I have a two gigabyte memory card
9245000	9247000	that's in my, you know, 3DS
9247000	9249000	or in my Wii system, how many
9249000	9251000	fucking blocks is that?
9251000	9253000	I don't know.
9253000	9255000	No one knows. Is the 3DS still speaking
9255000	9257000	blocks? Yes it does. Oh god.
9257000	9259000	Yes, it
9259000	9261000	does, and because
9261000	9263000	I mean, come on, man, everybody's
9263000	9265000	using computers nowadays, everybody
9265000	9267000	megabyte, the term megabyte's been
9267000	9269000	around forever.
9269000	9271000	Even if they don't, they have an 8 gig
9271000	9273000	iPod, they know what 8 gig means,
9273000	9275000	you know, the terminology
9275000	9277000	is everywhere now. And even
9277000	9279000	still though, why is it so hard to, you
9279000	9281000	know, megabyte? Okay,
9281000	9283000	well, I don't know what a megabyte
9283000	9285000	is, but I know that I have this many
9285000	9287000	on this memory card.
9287000	9289000	How's that difficult?
9289000	9291000	It's not, it really isn't, but
9291000	9293000	for whatever reason, they decided, let's
9293000	9295000	go ahead and do that again.
9295000	9297000	It's just like they make a lot of poor
9297000	9299000	decisions when it comes to different
9299000	9301000	software and features that they have on
9301000	9303000	these systems. Whatever, you know what,
9303000	9305000	Nintendo, you can play this game as long
9305000	9307000	as you want, and your system will be
9307000	9309000	successful for a while, and eventually
9309000	9311000	you're gonna hit that slump again.
9311000	9313000	You're gonna hit that slump again, and
9313000	9315000	then you're gonna be in fucking last
9315000	9317000	place, and oh, all that shit, now you
9317000	9319000	gotta catch up again. So
9319000	9321000	ride the wave while you can, but
9321000	9323000	eventually it's gonna come crashing down.
9323000	9325000	Alright, well, let's
9325000	9327000	get to the Skype line. We're gonna open that
9327000	9329000	on up, 1-877-GAME-OLR,
9329000	9331000	or our username on Skype is
9331000	9333000	OrangeLoungeRadio. Give us a call,
9333000	9335000	and we'll talk topics with you, if there's something
9335000	9337000	you wanna cover that we've talked about earlier tonight, or
9337000	9339000	maybe you wanna talk to us about something completely
9339000	9341000	new. While we wait for some calls,
9341000	9343000	cause there is a bit of a delay, Loki, do you have any
9343000	9345000	last minute stories for us tonight? Yeah, I do have one
9345000	9347000	thing. Sony is looking to dismiss
9347000	9349000	the other OS lawsuit. Remember,
9349000	9351000	there was people suing Sony
9351000	9353000	for removing the other OS
9353000	9355000	in the Playstation 3. I thought they dismissed that a long time ago.
9355000	9357000	Well, no they didn't. It was actually going to courts and stuff.
9357000	9359000	But here's the twist now. Sony wants
9359000	9361000	access to all those people's hard
9361000	9363000	drives that filed for the other
9363000	9365000	OS lawsuits, because they're saying
9365000	9367000	they may be part of a bigger hacker
9367000	9369000	conspiracy. Thank you! So basically
9369000	9371000	they're saying everybody that wanted Linux
9371000	9373000	on their system, they're a hacker, and they're out to
9373000	9375000	destroy Sony. Wasn't the government
9375000	9377000	using it? Oh yeah, but they're hackers, and they're out
9377000	9379000	to destroy Sony. Why put that in
9379000	9381000	your system if you think that everybody's
9381000	9383000	hackers out to destroy Sony?
9383000	9385000	If Sony made the goddamn
9385000	9387000	system, why don't they just make some
9387000	9389000	program that lets them see what's in the system?
9389000	9391000	I'm sure they could do that remotely, like a whole
9391000	9393000	Skynet thing, right? It's just terrible, but here's the thing,
9393000	9395000	I mean, well, if you think about it though,
9395000	9397000	if they made some sort of program and they had it
9397000	9399000	where you connected online to see that kind of stuff,
9399000	9401000	that would update their system, and they
9401000	9403000	would be unable to have the other OS
9403000	9405000	in there, cause you can't update your system
9405000	9407000	anymore if you want to keep that.
9407000	9409000	But, the real,
9409000	9411000	well, one reason they wanted to see the hard drives
9411000	9413000	is to make sure that they actually did have other OS on,
9413000	9415000	and this is their Playstation 3 hard drives,
9415000	9417000	not their PCs. They wanted to make sure
9417000	9419000	they had other OS on there, but
9419000	9421000	at the same time though, and the judge doesn't understand,
9421000	9423000	is when you put other OS on there,
9423000	9425000	it's now a computer, and
9425000	9427000	you need to go through the protocols
9427000	9429000	for, you know, discovery for that kind of
9429000	9431000	stuff where you have to have a third party company, look
9431000	9433000	at the stuff, not Sony, going through
9433000	9435000	and having full access to your
9435000	9437000	hard drive of your now computer.
9437000	9439000	Alright, let's go to the phones. Hi, you're on Orange
9439000	9441000	Launch Radio, who's this? Hey, it's Ronma,
9441000	9443000	what's up everyone? Your
9443000	9445000	audio, I have to hang up.
9445000	9447000	There's some terrible, terrible feedback that you've got
9447000	9449000	going on, and he's probably sitting there going
9449000	9451000	why did he hang up on us? But you've got some,
9451000	9453000	I know you all heard that, right?
9453000	9455000	Yeah, ow. So,
9455000	9457000	you gotta fix that. Echo 123, buddy.
9457000	9459000	He works every other week, I wonder what's wrong with
9459000	9461000	tonight, let's see. Alright, let's try to go.
9461000	9463000	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
9463000	9465000	Sledge and Zaku here. Hey Zaku, what's up, buddy?
9465000	9467000	Nothing much, just
9467000	9469000	trying to recover for, you know, for a
9469000	9471000	sleepy Sunday night watching, you know, listening
9471000	9473000	to your show. But yeah,
9473000	9475000	just going on the debate of how Nintendo's
9475000	9477000	basically, like, you know, they're
9477000	9479000	basically like, they're basically
9479000	9481000	regressive at this point. I mean,
9481000	9483000	they're pissing off devs to, you know,
9483000	9485000	and it goes back to how
9485000	9487000	too much pride they have, like,
9487000	9489000	remember how they, like,
9489000	9491000	covertly, you know,
9491000	9493000	dissed, you know, the developers
9493000	9495000	of Angry Birds? Yes, I remember that.
9495000	9497000	The CEO actually, like,
9497000	9499000	he actually, you know, he didn't mention
9499000	9501000	it in a name, but he actually mentioned them
9501000	9503000	in, you know, within that same
9503000	9505000	aspect that they're just, like, bringing down
9505000	9507000	the wages. Kind of like,
9507000	9509000	you know, it's kind of like those, uh, you ever
9509000	9511000	seen this episode of South Park where
9511000	9513000	the, you know, the Goobacks episode
9513000	9515000	and you see the guy shouting, they took our
9515000	9517000	job. They took our jobs! It's
9517000	9519000	pretty much like that. They're complaining about
9519000	9521000	how, just because it's a
9521000	9523000	zero-sum game, well,
9523000	9525000	to them it appears to be a zero-sum game,
9525000	9527000	that it's just, like,
9527000	9529000	it's not worth, it doesn't pay to be a
9529000	9531000	developer anymore. But on the other
9531000	9533000	hand,
9533000	9535000	Rovio, what their
9535000	9537000	strategy is, as long as they get Angry Birds
9537000	9539000	for a cheap price with a lot more
9539000	9541000	replay value, then
9541000	9543000	they've done their job in terms of getting
9543000	9545000	people to play that game multiple
9545000	9547000	times. And even if you did
9547000	9549000	the analytics, if you tracked the number of
9549000	9551000	people just, like, launching the game and going
9551000	9553000	through levels, you would see
9553000	9555000	that it's a pretty, it's a pretty big
9555000	9557000	number. Even myself.
9557000	9559000	Think of the shit-tons they're making, not just off the game
9559000	9561000	itself, but all the license tie-ins
9561000	9563000	now. I mean, maybe they have a plan on this thing again.
9563000	9565000	They have a free version on the
9565000	9567000	Android market that runs on ads alone.
9567000	9569000	How many impressions, you know,
9569000	9571000	how many impressions are that,
9571000	9573000	you know, through AdSense? That's a lot.
9573000	9575000	That, you know, they make a
9575000	9577000	crap-ton of money instead of, you know, aside
9577000	9579000	from selling it for 99 cents,
9579000	9581000	which it pays for itself after a few plays.
9583000	9585000	So Nintendo's just threatened by that lower
9585000	9587000	price point? I mean, Nintendo also, God,
9587000	9589000	go in any Hot Topic,
9589000	9591000	and next to, like, one Angry Birds shirt,
9591000	9593000	you'll see, like, 20 Nintendo
9593000	9595000	classic franchise
9595000	9597000	shirts, you know? Everybody has a...
9597000	9599000	Nintendo lives off nostalgia, man.
9599000	9601000	But that's the thing, is, like,
9601000	9603000	Nintendo, on the other hand, can't...
9603000	9605000	I know they basically are
9605000	9607000	marketing... They've marketed the Wii
9607000	9609000	as more of a casual gamer system,
9609000	9611000	therefore, you know,
9611000	9613000	setting aside
9613000	9615000	all the, you know, all the
9615000	9617000	hardcores that they marketed to in the past.
9617000	9619000	I mean, that's pretty
9619000	9621000	much it. As long as you're...
9621000	9623000	What's happening is that they're getting
9623000	9625000	outgunned by other, you know,
9625000	9627000	more easily
9627000	9629000	available platforms, like an iPhone
9629000	9631000	or an Android. Something that most
9631000	9633000	people would have in their pocket,
9633000	9635000	aside from a DS.
9635000	9637000	And it's more than capable of running those games.
9639000	9641000	Alright, anything else on your mind tonight, Zaku?
9641000	9643000	Um, Back to the
9643000	9645000	Future of the Game, the first episode, is
9645000	9647000	pretty much free from their
9647000	9649000	Telltale Games site.
9649000	9651000	Pretty awesome so far. Yeah, you having a good time with that?
9651000	9653000	Although, even contrary to what the others are saying,
9653000	9655000	it's, like, it's getting better.
9655000	9657000	Like, I'm hearing the third episode's actually the best
9657000	9659000	so far. I'm really excited
9659000	9661000	for their Jurassic Park game. I don't know
9661000	9663000	what it is, but, like, you know, they had a new trailer
9663000	9665000	come in. It's like an adventure game where you just, like, click
9665000	9667000	around to solve puzzles
9667000	9669000	based on the storyline of the Back
9669000	9671000	to the Future.
9671000	9673000	And the guy who basically does
9673000	9675000	Marty's voice is very close.
9675000	9677000	Does almost a
9677000	9679000	spot-on impression of Michael J. Fox.
9679000	9681000	Nice. You have to actually listen to it, though.
9681000	9683000	I do. I really need to play the Back
9683000	9685000	to the Future. I forgot that it was
9685000	9687000	the free, you know,
9687000	9689000	time for it now that it's out. Because I remember
9689000	9691000	the whole stories about the, you know, code
9691000	9693000	word being in the Blu-ray and everything. So that's cool
9693000	9695000	that it's out there for free now. So I'll definitely have to check that out.
9695000	9697000	The first episode's out for free. Right.
9697000	9699000	They're gonna get you on the other ones, though.
9699000	9701000	Yeah. Alright. Well, Zaku,
9701000	9703000	take care, buddy. We'll see you next time.
9703000	9705000	Alright, bye.
9705000	9707000	1877 Game OLR.
9707000	9709000	Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
9709000	9711000	Was that it?
9711000	9713000	You don't have any other stories for us, Loki?
9713000	9715000	Uh, well, that was the only
9715000	9717000	new one right now. Let me dig up
9717000	9719000	some other stuff here real quick.
9719000	9721000	Because, I don't know, it was kind of annoying
9721000	9723000	that, uh, I think
9723000	9725000	Oh, and the other thing, too,
9725000	9727000	that should be noted with that is they're basically
9727000	9729000	saying contradictory things
9729000	9731000	in both cases, and they're on record saying
9731000	9733000	contradictory things in both cases, so
9733000	9735000	they're lying somewhere.
9735000	9737000	Like, they're saying, oh,
9737000	9739000	well, this other OS stuff, that's all
9739000	9741000	Sony, Japan's, you know, doing.
9741000	9743000	They're behind it. And then
9743000	9745000	in the GeoHats case,
9745000	9747000	or the GeorgeHats case, they're like,
9747000	9749000	oh, that's Sony America. They're behind it.
9749000	9751000	Which is it, Sony?
9751000	9753000	You're on record saying both, so
9753000	9755000	you've perjured yourself one way or another.
9757000	9759000	Alright. We're gonna try this call
9759000	9761000	again, see if it's better. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
9761000	9763000	It's Ranma. Can you hear me better
9763000	9765000	now? Yes, and you're not giving that horrible
9765000	9767000	feedback. I don't know what that was about.
9767000	9769000	I think it's something with my computer.
9769000	9771000	I think it's long overdue for a fresh Windows
9771000	9773000	installation. Maybe Sony is trying to get
9773000	9775000	inside your computer and see what you're really doing with it.
9775000	9777000	Either that, maybe because Logitech
9777000	9779000	is pissed because I dumped their headset
9779000	9781000	for a better Microsoft one. SonyCat
9781000	9783000	is watching you masturbate.
9783000	9785000	I could give two shits about that. Alright.
9785000	9787000	What's on your mind tonight?
9787000	9789000	Something a little bit different,
9789000	9791000	as, if you remember what we talked about
9791000	9793000	in PM last week,
9793000	9795000	I upgraded my phone.
9795000	9797000	I now have an Android phone, and
9797000	9799000	I'm doing something I thought
9799000	9801000	I'd never find myself doing. What's that?
9801000	9803000	Mobile gaming.
9803000	9805000	Oh my gosh, alright.
9805000	9807000	Took the plunge and did some mobile gaming.
9807000	9809000	Now, do you have a phone that has actual
9809000	9811000	tangible controls, or is it an
9811000	9813000	all-touchscreen phone, like the iPhone?
9813000	9815000	Both. I have the
9815000	9817000	Samsung Epic 4G. Touchscreen,
9817000	9819000	if I slide it out, I have keyboard
9819000	9821000	access. Nice.
9821000	9823000	But so far, the games I've played
9823000	9825000	is completely in total touchscreen, which is not
9825000	9827000	so bad, even with the
9827000	9829000	screen protector on it.
9829000	9831000	Well, what kind of games have you been playing? Tell us about
9831000	9833000	some of the better ones.
9833000	9835000	Well, you can probably assume I have
9835000	9837000	that game everyone has been talking about,
9837000	9839000	Angry Birds. Of course.
9839000	9841000	I'm playing it, and I'm like, I can see
9841000	9843000	why people are into it. It's like
9843000	9845000	the new version of Worms
9845000	9847000	or something like that, you know?
9847000	9849000	And as
9849000	9851000	I was going through the marketplace,
9851000	9853000	I came across this one game that was probably
9853000	9855000	you probably tickled pink over the name of it.
9855000	9857000	Uh oh. It's called
9857000	9859000	Pew Pew. Pew Pew!
9859000	9861000	What is it?
9861000	9863000	It has involved kittens with lasers?
9863000	9865000	No, it's
9865000	9867000	pretty much Geometry Wars.
9867000	9869000	Oh, that's kinda cool. On Android.
9869000	9871000	That's cool. And it has
9871000	9873000	a couple of controllers on there
9873000	9875000	so you can control and play, and I've been
9875000	9877000	playing it, and the controlling is not so bad
9877000	9879000	on it, and
9879000	9881000	see, I picked up another game
9881000	9883000	that I got from Joe of Data called
9883000	9885000	Unfurry. That's like a block puzzle
9885000	9887000	game, but it's pretty good.
9887000	9889000	And as I'm going through the marketplace,
9889000	9891000	I can understand why
9891000	9893000	Nintendo said what they said.
9893000	9895000	I think the GDC about these
9895000	9897000	games on the 3DS,
9897000	9899000	because I looked at them like,
9899000	9901000	yeah, a lot of these games are total
9901000	9903000	and utter crap. Call me crazy.
9903000	9905000	If I'm dropping $250
9905000	9907000	on a gaming comp, I'd like
9907000	9909000	some quality games, you know?
9909000	9911000	Right.
9911000	9913000	You just don't want a bunch of free stuff
9913000	9915000	that sucks.
9915000	9917000	That's pretty much it. Now, if they
9917000	9919000	do something along the lines of
9919000	9921000	if a bunch of independent
9921000	9923000	developers put together a bunch of these
9923000	9925000	minigames together, and put together
9925000	9927000	some type of collection
9927000	9929000	for like $20 or something like that,
9929000	9931000	that probably wouldn't be so bad.
9931000	9933000	You know, funny enough, there's something like that on Steam, or at least
9933000	9935000	there was. It was either April Fool's Day or the day after.
9935000	9937000	There was like 13 independent games
9937000	9939000	going for like maybe $29
9939000	9941000	or $39, and one of them
9941000	9943000	was like Super Meat Boy. There was some big titles
9943000	9945000	in there. VVV, which I think Act F's
9945000	9947000	called in about before it was in there.
9947000	9949000	Yeah, I remember that.
9949000	9951000	High Profile Indie Games was in this big pack
9951000	9953000	lately, so sometimes the indie games will
9953000	9955000	band together for big sales like that.
9955000	9957000	Definitely.
9957000	9959000	And I started to notice that,
9959000	9961000	yeah, I'm playing around with
9961000	9963000	these games more than my
9963000	9965000	DS, because my phone is right there.
9965000	9967000	Pull it out, hit the button, the game
9967000	9969000	starts. Whereas I gotta pull it out of my
9969000	9971000	bag, fire it up, pick the game,
9971000	9973000	and start it up, you know? I guess it's like
9973000	9975000	convenience. It's a portable system where you don't have
9975000	9977000	to think about grabbing the system. You just, you always
9977000	9979000	have it on you.
9979000	9981000	And definitely, yes.
9981000	9983000	There you go. Well, congratulations
9983000	9985000	on jumping into mobile gaming.
9985000	9987000	Anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?
9987000	9989000	Yeah, something that I think
9989000	9991000	Jamie would greatly appreciate.
9991000	9993000	What is that?
9993000	9995000	DDR Dollar Bill went to Megacon, and he
9995000	9997000	got me this shirt. It says
9997000	9999000	on the back,
9999000	10001000	KOKRK,
10001000	10003000	King of Kong, Orlando, Florida.
10003000	10005000	And on the front it says,
10005000	10007000	Never Surrender, Never,
10007000	10009000	Billy Mitchell.
10009000	10011000	And I just noticed
10011000	10013000	that it's a limited
10013000	10015000	edition shirt with his signature.
10015000	10017000	It says, Billy Mitchell
10017000	10019000	Video Game Player of the Century.
10019000	10021000	How about Jerkface
10021000	10023000	of the Century? I like that
10023000	10025000	even better.
10025000	10027000	Aw, I'm sure he's a nice guy.
10027000	10029000	No, he's not actually.
10029000	10031000	He's a big jerk.
10031000	10033000	No, I've never talked to the guy.
10033000	10035000	But he apparently sells really good barbecue sauce?
10035000	10037000	Hey.
10037000	10039000	That works. Let me be the judge of that, because I love
10039000	10041000	my barbecue sauce. Me too.
10041000	10043000	Alright, Rama, we're gonna let you go, try to fit in one more
10043000	10045000	call before we end the Skype tonight, so take care, buddy.
10045000	10047000	Wonderful. Bye.
10047000	10049000	Alright.
10049000	10051000	Let's see if we can take one more call
10051000	10053000	on the Skype line. 1-877-GAME-OLR
10053000	10055000	or our username on Skype is
10055000	10057000	OrangeLoungeRadio. Any other
10057000	10059000	stories?
10059000	10061000	Yeah, there's a new game, I don't know if you've
10061000	10063000	ever played the game QWOP.
10063000	10065000	Remember QWOP?
10065000	10067000	I have not played QWOP. I've played a lot of crap.
10067000	10069000	I have.
10069000	10071000	Anyways, there's a new game called
10071000	10073000	GURP, and it's a rock climbing game
10073000	10075000	that requires you to basically
10075000	10077000	kind of
10077000	10079000	bend your fingers in
10079000	10081000	almost a twister type of way
10081000	10083000	using the shift keys, the mouse buttons,
10083000	10085000	or shift keys are the mouse buttons, and you have to hit
10085000	10087000	certain letters
10087000	10089000	on your keyboard in order to climb,
10089000	10091000	and you have to avoid this rising water.
10091000	10093000	And if it's anything like QWOP, it's really
10093000	10095000	damn hard. Impossible, yeah.
10095000	10097000	Alright, let's take one more
10097000	10099000	call here on the Skype line before we call tonight.
10099000	10101000	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?
10101000	10103000	This is DT.
10103000	10105000	Hey, DarkTets Studio, what's up, buddy?
10105000	10107000	Oh, I
10107000	10109000	think you can probably guess. I know, I was gonna
10109000	10111000	say, this has got to be about
10111000	10113000	WonderCon. I know you were really excited
10113000	10115000	about your trip out to WonderCon, which happened this week.
10115000	10117000	Tell us about some of the games you saw at
10117000	10119000	WonderCon.
10119000	10121000	Oh, man. Well, Nintendo
10121000	10123000	had a huge boost, and they were showing off
10123000	10125000	all of the 3DS games they had
10125000	10127000	that.
10127000	10129000	Did anything
10129000	10131000	catch your eyes
10131000	10133000	over there? It was pretty cool?
10133000	10135000	Well, I like
10135000	10137000	that a little bit. Steel Diver.
10137000	10139000	Uh-huh.
10139000	10141000	It was pretty cool. Was that the first time you ever got to
10141000	10143000	touch 3- was that the first time you ever got to get your hands on
10143000	10145000	a 3DS? Yeah. What'd you think about
10145000	10147000	3D? What'd you think about it when you, like, first
10147000	10149000	saw it?
10149000	10151000	Oh, yeah, it was pretty neat. Yeah, did you
10151000	10153000	do that whole thing, like, cause I know I do
10153000	10155000	this the first time. Like, you know, you
10155000	10157000	know you're about to play a system that's 3D with
10157000	10159000	no glasses, but then you, like, you know, you're kinda
10159000	10161000	like, you have that little bit of a doubt where you're like,
10161000	10163000	oh, this is gonna be stupid. And then, like, you
10163000	10165000	pick it up and you're like, whoa, you kinda have
10165000	10167000	that moment of, whoa, it really is 3D.
10167000	10169000	Oh, yeah.
10169000	10171000	Yeah, so.
10171000	10173000	Batman also had, uh, Kate
10173000	10175000	Icarus demo. Oh, did they?
10175000	10177000	Nice. Was it playable
10177000	10179000	or was it just, like, a trailer?
10179000	10181000	Yeah, no, it was playable. Oh,
10181000	10183000	shit, nice. I felt like, uh, unless you ever played
10183000	10185000	Sin and Punishment. Uh-huh.
10185000	10187000	Yeah, it kinda
10187000	10189000	felt like that. Nice. By the way,
10189000	10191000	Sin and Punishment was- Lion with the analog stick
10191000	10193000	and the name was the- Sin
10193000	10195000	and Punishment was another one of those games that
10195000	10197000	Fry's, that they had, like, 20 extra copies of
10197000	10199000	that they were trying to get rid of. The, uh, new
10199000	10201000	one that was out on the Wii. Mm.
10201000	10203000	It's unfortunate. Anyway, sorry about that,
10203000	10205000	DT. Yeah, I'm sorry.
10205000	10207000	But, uh, okay, well, what other,
10207000	10209000	what other, like, did Capcom have anything? I
10209000	10211000	know you always try to run over there and look at their booth.
10211000	10213000	Oh, yeah, well,
10213000	10215000	most of the stuff they had, those stuff was already
10215000	10217000	out, but they did have Resident Evil,
10217000	10219000	which was, well, it's alright, I guess.
10219000	10221000	Oh, cool.
10221000	10223000	Mm-hmm.
10223000	10225000	Um, what else?
10225000	10227000	Any other games?
10227000	10229000	Uh, let's
10229000	10231000	see, they had the, all the
10231000	10233000	big movie, comic book movie games,
10233000	10235000	like Thor and Captain America and
10235000	10237000	Green Lantern. Oh, yeah, god,
10237000	10239000	there's gonna be a ton of those this summer with all the
10239000	10241000	comic book movies coming out. Oh, yeah, we have Thor,
10241000	10243000	Green Lantern, there's an X-Men movie
10243000	10245000	as well, right, the first class? It's crap.
10245000	10247000	I know, I so don't wanna see it, I don't care.
10247000	10249000	Uh, what else is there?
10249000	10251000	I think there's, um,
10251000	10253000	I feel like I'm missing some huge ones.
10253000	10255000	Oh, well, whatever.
10255000	10257000	What, huge? Comic book movies.
10257000	10259000	Comic book movies. There's Thor,
10259000	10261000	there's Captain America, Green Lantern,
10261000	10263000	Green Lantern, there's the big three.
10263000	10265000	There's X-Men First Class,
10265000	10267000	there's the Spider-Man reboot this year, or is that next year?
10267000	10269000	No, that's not for a while.
10269000	10271000	And, um,
10271000	10273000	but they're also, I think, gonna
10273000	10275000	be rebooting Fantastic Four,
10275000	10277000	Transformers, if you wanna count that as, uh,
10277000	10279000	another Superman,
10279000	10281000	and, uh, Batman.
10281000	10283000	Oh, yeah, Batman 3 is next year, and that I'm
10283000	10285000	excited about, but I don't know how the game would be.
10285000	10287000	Well, I did see your write-up,
10287000	10289000	uh, is available over at OrangeLoungeRadio.com,
10289000	10291000	so it looks like you kept a little dear diary
10291000	10293000	while you were there, and saw stuff.
10293000	10295000	Now, I have to ask, did you get to see the masquerade at all?
10295000	10297000	Uh,
10297000	10299000	a little bit, it's a bunch of costumes
10299000	10301000	all over. Did you see,
10301000	10303000	by chance, the, um,
10303000	10305000	Main Street Electronica Parade?
10305000	10307000	Oh, no,
10307000	10309000	I didn't see that.
10309000	10311000	One of my friends was in that, and that, uh,
10311000	10313000	she's been on the show before, Victoria, I think,
10313000	10315000	filled in one week when Jamie wasn't here.
10315000	10317000	She was one of the gals in the, it was a, uh,
10317000	10319000	they did the Main Street Electrical Parade, but with
10319000	10321000	a Tron theme, like the Tron guy was stuck
10321000	10323000	in the Main Street Electric Parade.
10323000	10325000	Yeah, it was pretty awesome.
10325000	10327000	They didn't win! They were robbed!
10327000	10329000	Of course, I didn't see the winning video, but I'm extremely
10329000	10331000	biased. Extremely biased.
10331000	10333000	So, alright, well, DT, I'm glad you had fun
10333000	10335000	at the show. You know, we will actually have to go
10335000	10337000	some year. This was just really not a good year
10337000	10339000	for me to go, but I am hoping we will go
10339000	10341000	to Find Me this year. That is
10341000	10343000	something we're trying to do, so we'll see. Alright.
10343000	10345000	Oh, we're gonna go back next year, so.
10345000	10347000	Awesome. Well, we'll try to make it next year.
10347000	10349000	Alright. Alright. Take care and check out
10349000	10351000	that article at orangelawnsready.com by DT.
10351000	10353000	Alright, bye guys!
10353000	10355000	Yep.
10355000	10357000	I don't know why I said guys. I was saying bye to you guys.
10357000	10359000	Bye to you guys. I'm gonna go read that article. Alright.
10359000	10361000	No, it is about time to say bye, guys.
10361000	10363000	The show's about over.
10363000	10365000	Thanks, you guys, though, for tuning in to us. We're gonna
10365000	10367000	close up the Skype line. If you didn't get through tonight,
10367000	10369000	sorry. Try sending us an
10369000	10371000	email next time. Mailbag
10371000	10373000	at orangelawnsready.com is the place where you
10373000	10375000	can send us an email.
10375000	10377000	Let me ask Loki one more time if there's any last minute
10377000	10379000	stories before we wrap it all up. Yeah, there's
10379000	10381000	a leaked Forza 4 pitch
10381000	10383000	video that was supposed to be, I think, part of their
10383000	10385000	E3 presentation, and
10385000	10387000	basically confirmed everything that
10387000	10389000	was already leaked out regarding
10389000	10391000	Forza 4, including the head tracking,
10391000	10393000	the Kinect
10393000	10395000	integration, that kind of stuff.
10395000	10397000	Good stuff.
10397000	10399000	Head tracking, pretty awesome. They were saying, yes, you'll
10399000	10401000	be able to use head tracking to look into the corners
10401000	10403000	when you're driving and stuff. Although, that's a little
10403000	10405000	awkward for me.
10405000	10407000	I think because if your TV's in front of you,
10407000	10409000	you can't really turn your head to the side.
10409000	10411000	It's gonna be a little weird, yeah.
10411000	10413000	It'd be cool if the multiple
10413000	10415000	monitors support or whatever, but
10415000	10417000	once again, why would you need
10417000	10419000	head tracking if you have multiple monitors?
10419000	10421000	But hey,
10421000	10423000	glad to see they're using head tracking,
10423000	10425000	so that'll be awesome.
10425000	10427000	Alright, very cool.
10427000	10429000	This might be a little hint of what is to come
10429000	10431000	for the next generation of Kinect, and this could be very,
10431000	10433000	very good. Yeah. So we'll see.
10433000	10435000	Alright, well it's that time of the show where we go around
10435000	10437000	and get everybody's final thought as we wrap
10437000	10439000	up another week here at Orange Lounge Radio.
10439000	10441000	SalaciousPop, thanks again for being here.
10441000	10443000	You did a lot of talking this week. I'm very proud of you.
10443000	10445000	Alright, so thanks, and do you have
10445000	10447000	any final thoughts for our listeners?
10451000	10453000	No.
10453000	10455000	Alright then, alright.
10455000	10457000	Let's see, Dark Soccer, I guess I'll go to you next.
10457000	10459000	Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
10459000	10461000	I want more pinkberry.
10461000	10463000	And my final thought along
10463000	10465000	those lines is that the Lychee
10465000	10467000	pinkberry can go to hell.
10467000	10469000	Blood orange forever. It's not gross.
10469000	10471000	It's good. It's not blood orange.
10471000	10473000	But the mango is amazing.
10473000	10475000	Eh, whatever. It's not blood orange.
10475000	10477000	Alright, Loki, your final thoughts tonight?
10477000	10479000	Um...
10479000	10481000	I don't know.
10481000	10483000	I'm down to
10483000	10485000	my US 3DS system.
10485000	10487000	I got rid of all the rest.
10487000	10489000	Aww.
10489000	10491000	Aww, that's great.
10491000	10493000	Did the wife catch you?
10493000	10495000	No.
10495000	10497000	He was like, why would she?
10497000	10499000	And then you're gonna come home,
10499000	10501000	and be like, what?
10501000	10503000	No, she doesn't listen to the show.
10503000	10505000	I was talking to her last week.
10505000	10507000	She listened for just a minute.
10507000	10509000	It was like...
10509000	10511000	Just long enough for a baby to hear daddy.
10511000	10513000	Pretty much, yeah.
10513000	10515000	She's trying to get him
10515000	10517000	for two naps tonight.
10517000	10519000	Last night he woke up
10519000	10521000	with me, I woke up with him at five.
10521000	10523000	I usually wake up with him at five in the morning.
10523000	10525000	Every day.
10525000	10527000	On the weekends even.
10527000	10529000	And so he wouldn't go
10529000	10531000	back down to bed for like about an hour.
10531000	10533000	He was just trying to get him to go back down.
10533000	10535000	And he finally slept till
10535000	10537000	seven forty, but...
10537000	10539000	I'm actually now able to be
10539000	10541000	wide awake at five in the morning.
10541000	10543000	Which works out, because I can work on my PC sometimes.
10543000	10545000	You know, and able to work on
10545000	10547000	Grand Theft Auto map edits and stuff like that
10547000	10549000	really in the morning without being interrupted.
10549000	10551000	But, uh...
10551000	10553000	It's tough.
10553000	10555000	I have to take naps now on the weekends
10555000	10557000	sometimes, because
10557000	10559000	there's only so many days you can wake up that early
10559000	10561000	and not be affected by it.
10561000	10563000	Well, Rob naps every day and he doesn't even have a kid.
10563000	10565000	So, don't feel too bad.
10565000	10567000	Hey, you've earned those naps.
10567000	10569000	Ring ring, hi pot, it's kettle on the phone.
10569000	10571000	I wanted to say,
10571000	10573000	and I know they're not listening obviously,
10573000	10575000	and I don't think they listen normally,
10575000	10577000	but congratulations to our friends
10577000	10579000	Eric and Mel for their brand new baby girl.
10579000	10581000	Cute baby!
10581000	10583000	Someone finally had a girl.
10583000	10585000	I know, it's like a big sausage fest,
10585000	10587000	but finally
10587000	10589000	finally getting some girls in here.
10589000	10591000	Alright.
10591000	10593000	Alright, well that does it for another week

10613000	10615000	one more time, episode 409.
10615000	10617000	I guess that means we have to do some cleaning next week
10617000	10619000	because it's 409. Hey, I cleaned that desk.
10619000	10621000	You did. It better not need cleaning next week.
10621000	10623000	I'll dirty it up. It isn't, it's
10623000	10625000	dust free, lemony fresh.
10625000	10627000	But shirmy tainted.
10627000	10629000	Well of course, duh.
